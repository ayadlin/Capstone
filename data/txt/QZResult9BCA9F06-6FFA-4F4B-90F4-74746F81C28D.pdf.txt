Abstract

Author Manuscript

Prostate tumors develop resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by multiple
mechanisms, one of which is to express constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) splice
variants lacking the ligand binding domain. AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7, also termed AR3) is the
most abundantly expressed variant that drives prostate tumor progression under ADT conditions.
However, the molecular mechanism by which AR-V7 is generated remains unclear. In this
manuscript, we demonstrated that RNA splicing of AR-V7 in response to ADT was closely
associated with AR gene transcription initiation and elongation rates. Enhanced AR gene
transcription by ADT provides a pre-requisite condition that further increases the interactions
between AR pre-mRNA and splicing factors. Under ADT conditions, recruitment of several RNA
splicing factors to the 3’ splicing site for AR-V7 was increased. We identified two RNA splicing
enhancers and their binding proteins (U2AF65 and ASF/SF2) that played critical roles in splicing
AR pre-mRNA into AR-V7. These data indicate that ADT-induced AR gene transcription rate and
splicing factor recruitment to AR pre-mRNA contribute to the enhanced AR-V7 levels in prostate
cancer cells.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is androgen depletion therapy
(ADT). Although initially effective, most tumors progress to castration-resistant PCa
(CRPC) even under treatment with the most potent anti-androgens (e.g. MDV3100
(enzalutamide) and abiraterone). No curative therapy is available (1). It is commonly agreed
that re-activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling contributes to CRPC (2, 3)
through several proposed mechanisms including: AR gene amplification/mutation and AR
protein overexpression (4, 5), intra-tumoral androgen synthesis (6, 7), aberrant expression of
AR co-regulators (8) and alternative AR activation by cytokines and growth factors in the
absence of androgens (9). In addition, recent findings indicate that the AR is also expressed
as C-terminal truncated variants, called ARvs, through alternative RNA splicing (10-15).
Lacking the ligand-binding domain of full length AR (AR), ARvs are constitutively active in
driving AR-regulated transcription and promoting tumor progression, even under castrate
conditions (11, 13, 15, 16). ARvs regulate a mitotic form of the AR-transcriptome rather
than one associated with more differentiating functions (17, 18). Expression of ARvs occurs
frequently in CRPC tumors (19). Although a number of ARvs have been described in PCa
cell lines and xenografts, AR-V7 (also termed AR3) is the most commonly expressed ARv
in human tissues (11, 13, 20). Its levels are correlated with increased risk of biochemical
relapse (11, 13) and shorter survival time of CRPC patients (20). These results suggest a
critical role of AR-V7 in supporting CRPC. However, the molecular mechanism by which
AR-V7 mRNA is spliced remains unclear.

Pre-mRNA splicing involves stepwise assembly of RNA splicing factors to the regions
containing 5’ and 3’ splicing sites, excision of the intron sequences and re-ligation of the
adjacent exons (21). Alternative RNA splicing is the process whereby exons are selectively
excised from the pre-mRNA, resulting in a different combination of exons in the final
translated mRNA (22). AR-V7 mRNA is spliced at the alternative 3’ splice site (3’ss) next
to a cryptic exon, exon 3B, rather than the 3’ss next to exon 4, resulting in translation of a Cterminal truncated form of the AR protein (11, 13). The decision as to which splicing site is
excised is determined by both the regulatory RNA sequences (cis-elements) and their
associated RNA splicing proteins (trans-elements). Depending upon the functional
significance and location, some regulatory cis-elements are termed exonic splicing
enhancers (ESE) or intronic splicing enhancers (ISE) (23, 24). In addition, RNA splicing is
closely coupled with gene transcription (25). Both transcription initiation (26) and
elongation rates (27, 28) have a significant impact on the outcome of splicing. This is
achieved by the association of RNA splicing factors to the transcription machinery when
transcription is initiated (29-31). These protein complexes move along the gene during
transcription elongation, when transcribed pre-mRNA is screened by the RNA spliceosome
to define and excise the splice sites, before transcription is terminated (32-34). Therefore,
the abundance of a specific splice variant is controlled by both gene transcription rate and
splicing factor recruitment to the pre-mRNA during the alternative splicing process.
The question that remains to be answered is whether ADT regulates the RNA splicing
program that favors RNA synthesis of ARvs as a survival strategy for PCa in response to

ADT. In this manuscript, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which AR-V7 was
alternatively spliced in response to ADT.

RESULTS
AR and AR-V7 mRNA levels are increased in response to androgen deprivation

Author Manuscript

We first profiled AR and AR-V7 RNA levels in a panel of PCa cell lines: VCaP, LNCaP,
LN(AI) and LN95. Both LN(AI) and LN95 cells are derived from LNCaP cells, but have
been cultured under long-term ADT conditions, thus possessing an ADT-resistant
phenotype. Using an absolute quantification method, real-time qPCR showed that VCaP
cells expressed AR RNA that was 5-10 fold higher than LNCaP and LNCaP derived cells
(Fig.1 and Suppl.1A), consistent with the report that VCaP cells have an increased AR gene
copy number (35). AR RNA level was ~17.9 fold higher than AR-V7 in VCaP cells. LNCaP
cells expressed extremely low levels of AR-V7 RNA. Both LN(AI) and LN95 cells
expressed higher levels of AR-V7 than LNCaP cells. AR-V7 RNA levels in LN95 cells were
30-40% lower than that in VCaP cells. Western blotting assays showed consistently that
VCaP cells expressed higher AR protein levels than other cell lines (Fig.1B and Suppl.1B),
possibly due to the increase in AR gene copy number in VCaP cells. Both VCaP and LN95
cells expressed comparable levels of AR-V7 protein. LN(AI) cells expressed lower levels,
while parental LNCaP cells had undetectable levels of AR-V7 protein.

Author Manuscript

ADT conditions were reported to increase both RNA and protein levels of AR in PCa cell
lines and xenografts (17, 36). To determine whether ADT also regulated AR-V7 expression,
we treated PCa cells with DHT and/or MDV3100 (Fig.1C). DHT reduced AR RNA levels
significantly in VCaP and LNCaP cells, but only to a minor extent in LN(AI) cells. AR-V7
levels in LN(AI) cells were also repressed by DHT, following the changes of AR levels. In
contrast, neither AR nor AR-V7 RNA levels were altered by DHT or MDV treatment in
LN95 cells.

Author Manuscript

We found that AR-V7 expression was also reversibly regulated by DHT and MDV
treatments. After VCaP cells were pre-treated with DHT for 24 hours, adding MDV to the
culture medium dramatically up-regulated AR-V7 RNA and protein levels (Fig.2A-C). Vice
versa, DHT significantly supressed AR-V7 expression after VCaP cells were pre-treated
with MDV. Changes in AR-V7 RNA levels were correlated with AR levels. Using primary
cultures from MDV-resistant VCaP tumor xenografts grown in mice (n=10), we further
showed that both AR and AR-V7 RNA levels were maintained in relative high levels under
maximum ADT conditions, but significantly decreased when DHT was added (Fig.2D).
Since the doubling time of VCaP cells is 53 hours, changes in AR and AR-V7 RNA levels
cannot be accounted by clonal selection. These results indicated that RNA splicing of ARV7 was a dynamic and reversible process, which was regulated by AR signaling.
AR-V7 expression is important for VCaP cell proliferation under ADT conditions
The functional significance of AR-V7 expression was further tested in VCaP cells by
comparing cell proliferation rates under conditions of AR versus AR-V7 knockdown by
siRNA. SiRNA to exon 7 knocked down AR, siRNA to exon 3b knocked down AR-V7, and

siRNA to exon 1 knocked down total AR (AR-V7 + AR). In the presence of androgen
depletion and/or MDV treatments, AR-V7 or total AR, but not AR knockdown significantly
reduced VCaP cell growth (Fig. 3A). However, cell growth relied on AR when DHT was
present. Consistent with cell proliferation assays, expression levels of PSA and TMPSS2
were further dramatically decreased by siRNAs targeting AR-V7 or total AR, when
compared with siRNA targeting AR alone under androgen depletion and/or MDV treatment
conditions (Fig. 3B). In the presence of DHT, siRNA knocking down AR-V7 did not inhibit
PSA and TMPSS2 expression. However, siRNA targeting total AR presented more potent
suppressive effects to these genes when compared with siRNA targeting AR only.
Interestingly, UGT2B17 and UBE2C were previously demonstrated to be AR-V7 regulated
genes in prostate cancers (19). We further confirmed AR-V7 was required for UGT2B17
transcription in VCaP cells under ADT conditions. In contrast, DHT activated AR supressed
UGT2B17 RNA levels, which effects were blocked by AR knockdown. Similar observation
was also from UBE2C expression that was inhibited by AR but enhanced by AR-V7 (Suppl.
2). These findings indicate that under ADT conditions AR-V7 can replace AR to sustain cell
growth, and regulate a gene set distinct from AR. Our results support a critical role of ARV7 that is responsible for prostate cancer phenotype shift from androgen sensitive to CRPC
under castration stress. The efficiencies of siRNA knockdown of AR and or AR-V7 were
shown by Western blotting in Fig. 3C. Together, our results indicate that AR-V7 maintains
VCaP prostate cancer cell proliferation by an AR signaling mechanism under ADT
conditions.
AR-V7 RNA splicing is coupled with AR gene transcription

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since the RNA splicing process was known to be coupled with gene transcription, and our
data also indicated that AR-V7 RNA levels were correlated with AR RNA levels, we
examined whether active AR-V7 splicing was controlled by the AR gene transcription rate.
We applied three different approaches to inhibit AR gene transcription by treating cells with
actinomycin D (ActD), benzimidazole (DRB) or trichostatin A (TSA). Cells were also cotreated with either 10nM DHT or 5uM MDV for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 hours (Fig. 4). In the
presence of vehicle, MDV maintained while DHT dramatically decreased both AR and ARV7 RNA levels during 16 hours of treatment in VCaP cells, while AR and AR-V7 RNA
levels in LN95 cells were maintained at relatively constant levels. However in both VCaP
and LN95 cells, ActD and DRB eliminated, while TSA significantly reduced AR-V7 RNA
levels correlating with changes of AR RNA levels. ActD forms complexes with doublestrand DNA to prevent RNA pol II from forming the transcription initiation complex, while
DRB is an inhibitor of C-terminal domain of pol II that inhibits gene transcription at the
elongation step. TSA was confirmed to inhibit AR gene transcription in several different
prostate cancer cell lines (37, 38). These results together indicated that AR-V7 splicing was
dependent upon AR gene transcription initiation and elongation rates.
Recruitment, but not expression of RNA splicing factors contributes to AR-V7 splicing
Although RNA splicing is coupled with transcription, generation of a RNA splice variant
requires splicing factors that recognize and excise the alternative splice sites. We chose a
panel of splicing factors including U1A, U2AF65, AFS/SF2, hnRNP I, PSF and p54nrb that
were demonstrated to play essential roles in RNA splicing (39) and measured their protein

levels under DHT or MDV treatment. No changes in protein levels of these splicing factors
were observed under different treatments and among different cell lines (Suppl.3).

Author Manuscript

We next determined whether recruitment of splicing factors to the AR gene was altered
following ADT conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed
with primers amplifying the P1-P3 regions, corresponding to the 5’ and 3’ splice regions for
AR and AR-V7 (Fig.5). The P4 region is located upstream of the 5’UTR of human GAPDH
gene, a region of the gene where there are no active RNA splicing events. It therefore serves
as a negative control. Consistent with ADT-induced AR gene transcription, the recruitment
of pol II to P1, P2 and P3 regions were significantly higher in MDV treated VCaP cells.
These changes were concurrent with increased recruitments of several RNA splicing factors
(U1A, U2AF, ASF/SF2 and p54nrb) to P1, P2 and P3 regions. Exceptions were PSF (no
change) and hnRNP I (decreased recruitment). These data suggested that MDV treatment
increased spliceosome recruitment to the AR gene to process both AR and AR-V7 RNA
splicing. In contrast, although MDV also enhanced pol II and U1A, U2AF and p54nrb onto
P1 and P3 regions in LNCaP cells, their recruitments to the P2 region (containing AR-V7
3’ss) were not increased by MDV. These observations were consistent with low expression
of AR-V7 in LNCaP cells. Together, these results suggested that spliceosome recruitment to
the AR gene, rather than alterations in protein levels of splicing factors, contributed to ARV7 splicing.
Construction of AR-V7 minigene to identify RNA splicing enhancers

Author Manuscript

In order to identify any cis- and trans-element responsible for AR-V7 splicing, we
constructed the AR-V7 minigene plasmid (Fig.6A), with exon 3B and its flanking ~400bp
nucleotide sequence inserted in between exon 3 and exon 4 of the human AR gene. When
transiently transfected, the minigene expressed 12-25 fold of AR and 8-300 fold of AR-V7
higher than the levels of endogenous AR transcripts in PCa cell lines (Fig.6B). Driven by the
constitutively active CMV promoter, the levels of minigene transcribed AR-V7 were not
affected by DHT or MDV treatment. These observations indicated that gene transcription
rate, but not ADT condition per se, directly regulated AR-V7 RNA splicing.

Author Manuscript

To locate potential RNA sequences responsible for AR-V7 splicing, we screened exon 3B
and its flanking region using the Splicing Rainbow (40) and ESEfinder 3.0 (41) programs,
two bioinformatic tools to predict potential splicing factor binding sites. One intronic
splicing enhancer (ISE) and one exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) near the 3’ss of exon 3B
were identified. The ISE was predicted to bind hnRNP I or U2AF65, while the ESE was a
potential ASF/SF2 binding site. We applied mutagenesis and cloning techniques to further
construct AR-V7 minigenes carrying point mutations at either ISE or ESE site (Fig.6C).
When these mutant AR-V7 minigenes were introduced into PCa cells, only AR-V7
transcript levels, but not AR, were dramatically decreased (Fig.6D). To further confirm
whether the functions of ISE and ESE were mediated through the predicted RNA splicing
factors, we transfected AR-V7 minigenes into LNCaP cells in the presence of siRNAs
against hnRNP I, U2AF65 and ASF/SF2. The levels of AR transcribed by AR-V7 minigenes
were unchanged, regardless of siRNA knockdown or mutations at ESE or ISE with in the
minigenes (Fig.6E). In contrast, levels of AR-V7 transcribed by the AR-V7(WT) minigene

were dramatically decreased with hnRNP I, U2AF65 or ASF/SF2 knockdown. The ARV7(ISEm) minigene expressed very low levels of AR-V7, which were insensitive to any
knockdown of splicing factors. Interestingly, RNAi of U2AF65 and hnRNP I but not
ASF/SF2 further decreased AR-V7 levels transcribed by the AR-V7(ESEm) minigene.
These findings indicated that both the ISE and the ESE were specifically important for ARV7 splicing through interactions with U2AF65, hnRNP I and ASF/SF2 respectively.
Identification of RNA splicing factors responsible for AR-V7 splicing

Author Manuscript

To further study binding proteins for the ISE and the ESE, we synthesized two 40bp RNA
oligos to perform RNA pull-down assays (Fig.7A). Oligo 1 contains the ISE, while oligo 2
contains the ESE. Their sequences are listed in supplementary material. Both oligos were
incubated with purified Flag-tagged U2AF65, hnRNP I and ASF/SF2. hnRNP I and
U2AF65 bound oligo 1. These interactions were abolished when the ISE was replaced with
the ISEm (Fig.7B). Interestingly, hnRNP I and U2AF65 can also be pulled down by oligo 2.
However, those interactions were not affected by ESE point mutations. ASF/SF2 had a
strong association with oligo 2, but not with oligo 1. This interaction was also dramatically
decreased when ESE was replaced with the ESEm. In order to show specific U2AF65/
hnRNP I-ISE and ASF/SF2-ESE interactions, we also used oligos 1 and 2 to pull down two
other RNA splicing factors, U1A and Tra2β. U1A bound both oligos 1 and 2 even in the
presence of ISEm and ESEm, whereas Tra2β had no association to either RNA oligo. These
results indicate that ASF/SF2 specifically binds the ESE, while hnRNP I and U2AF65 bind
oligo 1 at the specific ISE site. They also bind oligo 2 but possibly through sequences other
than the ESE.

RNA co-immnunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were further performed (Fig.7C). Antibodies
against ASF/SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I, but not control IgG, precipitated AR pre-mRNA at
the P2 region (containing both the ISE and the ESE). Interestingly, hnRNP I was absent in
the P1 region (5’ss for both AR and AR-V7) and ASF/SF2 showed an extremely low level at
the P3 region (3’ss for AR). These observations suggest that hnRNP I functions primarily at
the 3’ss, while ASF/SF2 has a relatively higher specificity to the 3’ss for AR-V7,
emphasizing its important role for AR-V7 splicing. We further used real-time qPCR to
quantify the recruitments of ASF/SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I to the AR pre-mRNA at the
AR-V7 3’ss under DHT or MDV treatment for 2 hours in VCaP cells (Fig.7D). MDV
dramatically induced U2AF65 binding, but had no impact on ASF/SF2 and hnRNP I to the
P1 region. However, all of these splicing factors had enhanced recruitment to the P2 region
by MDV, while only U2AF65 and hnRNP I increased associations with the P3 region in
response to MDV treatment. These results suggested that ASF/SF2-ESE and U2AF65/
hnRNP I-ISE interactions were regulated by ADT condition in contributing to AR-V7
splicing.
To further confirm the functional significance of ASF/SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I for ARV7 splicing, we knocked down each splicing factor in VCaP and LN95 cells and measured
AR and AR-V7 levels by real-time PCR amplifying exon3/4 and exon3/3b (Fig.7E and 7H).
RNA silencing of ASF/SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I significantly reduced AR-V7 RNA
levels. In addition, hnRNP I knockdown also mildly reduced AR levels. To exclude the

possibility that ASF/SF2 and U2AF65 silencing also affect other splicing events particularly
that within the AR gene, we further showed that U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 knockdown did not
affect AR levels by both Northern and Western blotting (Fig.7F-G). In addition, we also
designed a pair of primers crossing exons 7/8 of the GAPDH gene to measure its RNA
splicing as a control, and showed that RNA splicing of the GAPDH gene was not affected
by RNA silencing of ASF/SF2 and U2AF65. The efficiency of RNA silencing was shown
by Western blotting (Suppl.4). These results suggested that both ASF/SF2 and U2AF65,
when compared with hnRNP I, were specifically important for AR-V7 splicing.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Although extensive studies show that constitutively transcriptional function of ARv is
important for CRPC progression, the molecular mechanisms by which ARv is alternatively
spliced remain unclear. Our studies demonstrate that AR gene transcription rates and
splicing factor recruitment to AR pre-mRNA near the AR-V7 3’ss are two important factors
contributing to AR-V7 splicing. The ADT condition does not directly regulate levels of ARV7 splicing. Rather it enhances AR gene transcription rates and contributes indirectly to the
generation of AR-V7 splice variant.

Author Manuscript

Our lines of evidence demonstrated that AR-V7 RNA synthesis depended upon active AR
gene transcription. In various experimental conditions, changes in AR-V7 RNA levels were
consistent with alterations of AR RNA levels in PCa cells. ADT induced the recruitment of
RNA pol II to the AR gene, reflecting active AR gene transcription (Fig.4). Concurrently,
higher AR and AR-V7 levels were observed under ADT conditions. Though ActD, DRB
and TSA acted through different mechanisms to decrease AR gene transcription, they
showed consistent repressive effects on AR-V7 RNA splicing (Fig.3). In addition, turning
on or off of AR gene transcription by DHT and MDV reversibly controlled AR-V7 splicing
(Fig.1-2). Previous publications showed that AR-V7 RNA was commonly expressed in PCa
cells and even normal prostate epithelium cells (13, 15) and that the ratio of ARv:AR
fluctuated between the 0.1-2.5% range depending upon active AR gene transcription by
castration or DHT treatment (36). These results together confirmed that AR-V7 RNA
splicing process was coupled with AR gene transcription rate.

Author Manuscript

Although AR gene transcription provides a favorable genetic environment for AR-V7 RNA
splicing, the enzymatic reaction to excise the 3’ss for AR-V7 splicing requires recruitment
of RNA splicing factor to AR pre-mRNA for AR-V7 RNA synthesis. We showed
interactions of U2AF65-ISE and ASF/SF2-ESE were critical for this splicing event.
Mutations at the ISE and the ESE abolished AR-V7 splicing, while RNA silencing of
U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 decreased AR-V7 levels in both VCaP and LN95 cells. These results
suggested that U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 by recognizing the ISE and the ESE acted as the
pioneer factors to direct further recruitment of RNA spliceosome to the AR-V7 3’ss.
Although U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 might participate in other RNA splicing events, such as
splicing the 3’ss next to exon 4 for AR, RNA silencing of U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 did not
affect AR RNA levels, nor do they affect the GAPDH (exon7/8) RNA splicing. Disruption
of U2AF65-ISE or ASF/SF2-ESE interactions had no impact on AR RNA levels (Fig. 5B).
It is likely that the recruitment of U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 to the AR-V7 3’ss is more efficient

due to the presence of the ESE and the ISE near the AR-V7 3’ss. ASF/SF2 is a
concentration-dependent regulator for alternative RNA splicing. Although ADT does not
alter its expression level, more AR pre-mRNA is available as a substrate for ASF/SF2 to
catalyse RNA splicing reactions. The existence of ESE within the exon 3B therefore is more
attractive for ASF/SF2 to be recruited to the AR-V7 3’ss and synthesize AR-V7 mRNA. In
addition, the involvement of U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 in excising 3’ss next to exon 4 might be
compensated by other splicing factors. As excision of the AR-V7 3’ss is more sensitive to
U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 protein levels, they may serve as rate limiting factors in controlling
AR-V7 splicing efficiency. In contrast, although hnRNP I also binds the ISE, knocking
down hnRNP I reduces both AR and AR-V7 levels, indicating hnRNP I serves as a general
factor regulating both AR and AR-V7 splicing. Together, these results support that AR-V7
splicing is not generated by a random splicing error. Rather, it is executed by specific RNA
splicing factors through recognizing specific RNA sequences near AR-V7 3’ss. This RNA
splicing event is enhanced in response to ADT as AR transcription rates increase.

Author Manuscript

Our studies also demonstrated that neither AR gene amplification nor rearrangement were
required for AR-V7 RNA splicing. Although VCaP cells have amplification of the AR gene,
no such genetic aberrance is not reported in LN95 cells. However, LN95 cells express
comparable AR-V7 RNA levels. Regardless of AR gene amplification, suppression of the
AR gene transcription rate or RNA silencing of splicing factors reduced AR-V7 splicing in
both LN95 and VCaP cells. In VCaP, LNCaP and LN(AI) cells, AR-V7 RNA levels were
repressed by DHT treatment (Fig.1). Particularly, AR-V7 RNA levels in VCaP cells can be
reversibly regulated by DHT or MDV treatment within 24 hours (Fig.2). These results
indicate that AR gene amplification does not attribute to AR-V7 splicing. Rather AR gene
amplification magnifies the levels of all transcripts by the AR gene, supporting VCaP cells
as an ideal model to study alternative RNA splicing events of the AR gene. Interestingly,
both castration resistant LN(AI) and LN95 cells express high levels of AR-V7 than their
parent LNCaP cells, supporting the hypothesis that generation of AR-V7 contributes to
CRPC progression.

Author Manuscript

An intragenic AR gene rearrangement was reported contributing to AR-V7 RNA synthesis
in 22Rv1 cells (42). No such gene rearrangement was noted in VCaP or castration-resistant
LN(AI) and LN95 cells (35). It could be possible that similar genomic disruption may exist
in some other PCa cells. However, AR-V7 mRNA synthesis still requires the removal of
intron sequences through the RNA splicing process. RNA splicing factors still need to
recognize and excise the 3’ss, and ligate the exon 3 with exon 3B. This enzymatic reaction
will depend on active AR gene transcription to create a permissible environment and
recruitment of splicing factors to AR pre-mRNA. Our data showed that changes in
recruitment of U2AF65 and ASF/SF2 occurred within 2 hours of MDV treatment (Fig.6D).
Enhanced AR-V7 RNA levels by MDV can be lowered within hours by subsequent DHT
treatment (Fig.2A-B), indicating AR-V7 RNA splicing is a dynamic and reversible process.
In summary, our data provide new insights to the complexity of AR gene splicing during
CRPC progression of prostate cancers. It invites further investigation that may lead to
therapeutic revenues to block AR-V7 expression in CRPC tumors and re-sensitize current
anti-AR therapy.

660) × 6.022 × 1023. A series of dilutions of the cDNAs were used as templates for real-time
qPCR as standards for AR or AR-V7, respectively. A standard curve was drawn by plotting
the CT value against the log of the copy number of molecules. The specific AR and AR-V7
copy numbers were calculated by the equation drawn from the graph. The relative
quantification method has been described before using GAPDH or 18s rRNA as the internal
control genes (43). All real-time qPCR assays were carried out using three technical
replications as well as three independent cDNA syntheses. Primer information is listed in the
supplementary materials.
Western Blot and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
After treatments, cells were incubated with lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH8.0, 150mM NaCl,
1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) followed by a brief sonication to extract
protein lysate. Lysates were immunoblotted with specific antibodies (detailed in
supplementary materials). ChIP assays followed the protocol we previously reported (43,
45). DNA templates retrieved from ChIP were analyzed by real-time qPCR on the ABI
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 August 29.

PRISM 7900 HT system (Applied Biosystems, Burlington, Canada) using the FastStart
Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche, Laval, Canada). Enrichments of immunoprecipitated
DNA fragments were determined by the Ct value. Data were calculated as a percentage of
input, and plotted as fold changes over control IgG. ChIP data were derived from five
independent experiments with samples in triplicate. Data are presented as means ±SEM.
MDV resistant VCaP Xenografts

Author Manuscript

MDV resistant xenografts of VCaP cells were generated by injecting VCaP cells sc in
castrate SCID mice (2×106 cells mixed 1:1 with Matrigel). When xenograft tumors reached
500-800 mm3, the animals were euthanized, tumors removed, collagenase digested and
again injected sc into castrate SCID mice 1:1 with Matrigel. Mice were treated with
MDV3100 (10mgm/kg) per gavage 5 days a week. When xenografts reach 800-1000 mm3
mice were euthanized, tumors final minced and 1/3 of each minced tumor was grown in a
100mm plastic culture dish with RPMI 1640 plus 5% CSS and 5uM gentamicin. Cells were
treated with 10uM MDV3100, 1nM DHT or MDV3100 plus DHT for 24 hours. Total RNA
was collected to measure AR and AR-V7 RNA levels by real-time qPCR. All animal studies
were approved by the University of Washington IACUC.
Transfection and RNA Silencing
Transient transfection of plasmid DNA used the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Burlington, Canada). Transfection of siRNA oligos used the siLentFect Lipid Reagent (BioRad, Mississauga, Canada) according to the provided protocols.
Cell Proliferation Assay

Author Manuscript

VCaP prostate cancer cells were first transfected with siRNA against the AR gene at
indicated exons. Cells were seed in seeded in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well) with culture
medium containing 10% charcoal stripped serum for another 24 hours. Cells were then
treated with vehicle, DHT or MDV3100 for 0-6 days. The reagent of 3-(4, 5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium
(Promega, Madison, WI) was added at each time point. Cell proliferation rates were
measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
AR-V7 Minigene Construction

Author Manuscript

The human genomic BAC clone (RP11-75E16) was provided by The Centre for Applied
Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto. It was used as the
template for PCR to amplify exon 3, exon 3B and exon 4 and their flanking intron regions
(~300-400 base pairs) by Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen,
Burlington, Canada). Three DNA fragments were cloned into the plasmid vector pCMV2
(Sigma, Oakville, Canada) between the EcoR I and Sal I sites. Full sequences of the vectors
will be provided upon request. DNA sequencing confirmed the integrity of the final AR-V7
construct. DNA mutagenesis was further performed using the AR-V7 minigene as the
template to construct AR-V7 (ESEm) and AR-V7 (ISEm).

RNA oligo pull-down was performed by first immobilizing 0.4nmol biotin-labeled RNA
oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) onto 100μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in a
final volume of 500μl of binding buffer (20mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 80mM potassium
glutamate, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, and 20% glycerol) at 4°C for 2 hours. RNA splicing
factors, U2AF65, ASF/SF2, hnRNP I, U1A and Tra2β proteins were purified by transfecting
plasmids encoding Flag tagged splicing factors into 293T cells, followed with purification
using Anti-Flag M2 Affinity gel (Sigma) as reported (45). The immobilized RNA oligos
were then incubated with 50ug purified splicing factors in binding buffer containing
30U/mL RNase OUT and 15ug/mL yeast tRNA in a final volume of 400μl at 4°C for 2
hours. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, once with washing buffer
(20mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 75mM KCl, 20% glycerol), and
suspended in 40μl of 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Eluted
proteins were analyzed by Western blot. RNA oligo sequences are listed in supplementary
materials.
RNA co-immunoprecipitation (RIP)

Author Manuscript

RIPs were performed as previously reported (46, 47) with the following modifications. Cell
nuclei were first extracted by isotonic buffer (10mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 2.5mM
MgCl2, 1mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail, 30U/ml RNase OUT, 10mM βglycerophosphate, and 0.5mM NaVO4). After incubation on ice for 7 minutes, nuclei were
collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 7 minutes, re-suspended in isotonic buffer
supplemented with 90mM of NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100, and briefly sonicated. Soluble
nuclear extracts were first pre-cleared with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz) and
control IgGs, then immunoprecipitated with 2ug of ASF/SF2, hnRNP I or U2AF65
antibody. After extensive washes by isotonic buffer, the precipitated antibody-antigen
complexes were first incubated with DNase I (RNase free, Ambion) for 15 minutes at 37°C,
followed with 50 μg of proteinase K (Roche) treatment for 15 minutes at 37°C. Coprecipitated RNA was then extracted by TRIzol and used for cDNA synthesis and PCR
analyses. Enrichment of precipitated RNA was determined by the threshold cycle (Ct) value.
Data were calculated as percentage of input, and plotted as fold changes over control IgG.
RIP data were derived from three independent experiments with samples in triplicate.
Results were presented as means ± SEM.
Northern Blotting

Author Manuscript

VCaP cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA against U2AF65, ASF/SF2 and
hnRNP I for 48 hours. Total RNA was extracted by using Trizol (Invitrogen). Twenty
microgram of total RNA were used for Northern blotting analysis to detect AR and 18S
RNA levels as described (48).
Statistics
Data were presented as means ± SEM that were calculated from three or more different
experiments. Statistical significances were calculated by using one-way ANOVA and paired

Figure 6. Construction of AR-V7 minigene to identify RNA splicing enhancers

Author Manuscript

(A) Schematic diagram of AR-V7 minigene construct and locations of primers used in realtime qPCR. Three DNA fragments of human AR gene were cloned into pCMV2 vectors.
Positions of each AR gene fragment in the chromosome X were marked. (B) 293T, VCaP,
LNCaP and LN95 cells were transiently transfected with mock vector or AR-V7 minigene
plasmid. Cells were treated with vehicle, 10nM DHT or 5uM MDV3100 for 24 hours.
Relative mRNA levels of AR and AR-V7 mRNA levels to GAPDH were determined by
real-time qPCR. (C) Using point mutagenesis, mutant AR-V7 mingenes were constructed
with mutations at the ISE and ESE sites. (D) 293T, VCaP, LNCaP and LN95 cells were
transiently transfected with mock, AR-V7 minigene (WT) or AR-V7 minigenes with
mutations at ISE (ISEm) and ESE (ESEm). (E) LNCaP cells were transfected with indicated

siRNAs followed with plasmids encoding mock or AR minigenes (WT, ISEm or ESEm).
Relative RNA levels of AR and AR-V7 to GAPDH were determined by real-time qPCR.
Results were obtained from three independent experiments and shown as means ± S.E.M.
One-way ANOVA followed by student t-test was carried out using GraphPad Prism
showing statistical significance with P< 0.001 as ***.

Figure 7. Characterization of RNA splicing factors that regulate AR-V7 splicing

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

(A) Schematic diagram of the AR gene between Exon 3 and 4 and locations of AR premRNA sequences used in RNA oligo pull-down assays (B) and primers used in RNA
immunoprecipitation assays (C-D). (B) Flag tag purified RNA splicing factors U2AF65,
hnRNP I, ASF/SF2, U1A and Tra2β were incubated with RNA oligos containing ISE, ESE
and their point mutants. Oligo associated splicing factors were detected by western blotting
assays. (C) VCaP cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against ASF/SF2,
U2AF65 and hnRNP I. Protein associated pre-mRNA were extracted and reverse transcribed
and analyzed by regular PCR with primers amplifying P1-3 regions. (D) VCaP cells were
treated with either 10nM DHT or 5uM MDV3100 for 2 hours. RNA immunoprecipitation
assays were performed. Real-time qPCR quantified the enrichments of ASF/SF2, U2AF65
and hnRNP I on pre-mRNA at P1-3 regions. Signals were calculated as percentage of input,
and blotted as fold changes over control IgG. (E) VCaP cells were transfected with siRNAs
against control, ASF/SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I for 48 hours, after which cells were treated
with either 10nM DHT or 5uM MDV3100 for another 24 hours. AR and AR-V7 RNA
splicing products were measured by real-time qPCR using relative quantification against
GAPDH. A primer set covering GAPDH exons 7 and 8 was used as a negative control to
monitor GAPDH gene splicing in response to RNAi of ASF/SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I. (FG) AR protein and mRNA were also detected by Western and Northern blotting assays.
Densitometry analyses calibrate RNA and protein bands of the AR gene by 18S and Actin as
the loading controls. In Fig 7G, both low and high exposures of Western blot with AR(N-20)
antibody were shown. (H) LN95 cells were transfected with siRNAs against control, ASF/
SF2, U2AF65 and hnRNP I for 48 hours. AR, AR-V7 and GAPDH splicing products were
measured by real-time qPCR. Data were derived from three independent experiments and
presented as means ± SEM. One-way ANOVA followed by student t-test was carried out
