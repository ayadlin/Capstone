Statin Use and the Risk of Renal Cell
Carcinoma in 2 Prospective US Cohorts
Wei Liu, MD1,2; Toni K. Choueiri, MD3; and Eunyoung Cho, ScD1,4

BACKGROUND: Statins are widely used cholesterol-lowering agents that may have potential antitumor effect.
Epidemiological studies on statin use and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk have been inconsistent. METHODS: The
authors investigated the association between statin use and RCC risk in the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. In total, 80,782 women and 37,869 men were followed for 14 years and 16 years, respectively. Regular statin use was assessed at baseline and was updated biennially during follow-up. RCC diagnosis was
confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven incident RCC cases (164 women and 113
men) were identified. Compared with no current use, the multivariate relative risks of current statin use were
0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-1.00) in women and 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.82) in men. The results
for ever versus never users of statins were similar. No dose-response relation with duration of statin use and RCC risk
was observed. On subgroup analyses, statin use was associated with a reduced RCC risk among women who had no
history of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicated that statin use may be associated with a lower

risk of RCC in women, although these results need to be investigated further. Cancer 2012;118:797-803. V

The statins are currently the most commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering agents that act by inhibiting the enzyme
3-hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. In addition, statins also are used widely in both primary
and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.1-3 Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that statins may have
potential antitumor effects4,5 through inducing apoptosis,6 inhibiting angiogenesis, and suppressing tumor metastasis.4,5
Previous epidemiological studies of statin use and the risk of kidney cancer are limited, largely retrospective in
nature, and have produced conflicting results. Although a lower risk of kidney cancer was reported in 2 nested case-control
studies,7,8 an increased risk among men was observed in a cohort study.9 However, other studies10-13 reported no associations. A recent meta-analysis that included some of those studies reported a nonsignificant inverse association.14 Few prospective studies exist in the general population. Therefore, we conducted a prospective analysis of the Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) to evaluate the influence of statin use on the risk of
renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common type of kidney cancer.15

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The NHS is a prospective cohort of 121,700 registered nurses between ages 30 years and 55 years and who lived in 11
states in the United States when they completed an initial questionnaire on their medical history and life-style factors in
1976. The HPFS is a prospective cohort study of 51,529 US men who were dentists, optometrists, osteopath physicians,
podiatrists, pharmacists, and veterinarians ages 40 to75 years at entry who responded to a baseline questionnaire in 1986.

These cohorts are described in detail elsewhere.16,17 Every
2 years, information was updated on newly diagnosed diseases and other life-style factors. The follow-up rates are
nearly 90% in both cohorts. The institutional review
boards of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the
Harvard School of Public Health approved the study.
Case Ascertainment
We obtained self-reported information on the occurrence
of kidney cancer on biennial questionnaires and asked
participants (or next of kin, for those who had died) who
reported a diagnosis of kidney cancer for permission to
access medical records in the cohorts. Deaths that
occurred in the cohort were documented by family members in response to follow-up questionnaires, and the
National Death Index18 was searched for those who did
not respond. We estimated from previous experience that
>98% of deaths were ascertained through these sources.18
Physicians who were blinded to exposure status reviewed
medical records to confirm RCC diagnoses and to identify
histologic subtypes. We included only those participants
with a diagnosis of RCC identified according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 2nd edition19 (code C64.9) or the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification20 (code
189.0), including clear cell, papillary, chromophobe, and
collecting duct RCC and RCC not otherwise classified,
based on the classification developed at a World Health
Organization workshop.21 Transitional cell cancers of the
renal pelvis were excluded.
Assessment of Exposures
In 1994 (NHS) and 1990 (HPFS) and biennially thereafter, participants were asked whether they regularly (2
times per week) used any cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Starting in 2000, participants were asked to report separately whether they regularly used statin drugs or other
cholesterol-lowering drugs. In 2000, statin users also were
asked to further specify their duration of use in 2-year categories with duration dating back to 1994 (NHS) and
1990 (HPFS), respectively. Statins were first sold in the
United States in 1987 and soon afterward became the
most popular cholesterol-lowering drugs. Therefore, statins probably constituted the majority of cholesterol-lowering drugs consumed in our cohorts. Indeed, responses
to the 2000 questionnaires indicated that approximately
93% of the cholesterol-lowering drugs used in the NHS
and 91% in the HPFS were statins. In the analysis, we
defined use of statins based on the information on dura-

798

tion of statin use collected in 2000 as well as information
on use of any cholesterol-lowering medications for the
period before 2000 and information on statin use starting
in 2000. No information was available on the brand, type,
or dose of drugs used.
In both cohorts, participants who reported regular
use of statins on a questionnaire were considered current
users for the subsequent 2-year follow-up period. Current
nonusers of statins during any given follow-up period
were those who did not report use on the current questionnaire. We also evaluated never users versus ever users.
Never users were defined as individuals who never had
used statins during follow-up. Ever users included current
and past users during follow-up. To provide the best estimate of the average long-term use of statins, we also calculated cumulative duration of statin use among ever users
by summing over the number of years of use based on
response to all available questionnaires.22 Duration of
statin use was evaluated as a categorical variable with a cutoff point of 4 years, a value close to the median duration
of statin use among statin users in both cohorts. For participants who missed a follow-up questionnaire, drug use
information was carried forward 1 cycle from the previous
follow-up cycle.
Assessment of Other Covariates
In both cohorts, we collected data on the demographics
and other risk factors for RCC at baseline and have
updated most of these factors every 2 years. Age in months
was calculated from date of birth to each questionnaire’s
return date. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using
height in 1976 and current weight updated every 2 years.
Other known or potential risk factors for RCC, including
smoking, history of hypertension, history of diabetes,23
regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), and physical activity, were collected at baseline
and was updated biennially. Pack-years of smoking were
calculated by multiplying the duration and dose of smoking. One pack-year of smoking is equivalent to having
smoked 1 pack per day for 1 year. Dietary intake, including alcohol,24 fruits, and vegetables,25 was assessed at
baseline and was updated every 4 years thereafter. To generate the physical activity score, we summed activity-specific metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours per week for
reported activities using MET values based on a compendium of activities. One MET-hour is the metabolic equivalent of sitting at rest for 1 hour. Parity,26 which is
defined as the number of childbirths experienced, was
queried from 1976 through 1984, when few additional

births were reported in the NHS. These covariates were
adjusted for as time-varying variables.
Data Analysis
At baseline, we excluded participants who had a diagnosis
of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and those
who did not return the questionnaire that included a
question on the use of cholesterol-lowering medications.
After these exclusions, 80,782 women and 37,869 men
remained eligible for the analysis.
We calculated person-years from the baseline questionnaire return date (1994 in the NHS; 1990 in the
HPFS) until the date of RCC diagnosis, date of death, or
the end of follow-up (June 2008 for NHS and January
2006 for HPFS), whichever came first. The incidence
rates of RCC according to regular use of statins were calculated by dividing the number of incident cases by the
total person-years in that category. We used Cox proportional hazards models27 to estimate relative risks (RRs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for
other risk factors of RCC. To control as finely as possible
for confounding by age, calendar time, and any possible
2-way interactions between these 2 time scales, we stratified the analysis jointly by age in months at the start of follow-up and calendar year of the current questionnaire
cycle. In the multivariate-adjusted analyses, we also controlled for smoking, current BMI (kg/m2), history of
hypertension, history of diabetes, duration of nonaspirin
NSAID use, physical activity; intake of fruit, vegetables,

and alcohol in both cohorts; and parity in the NHS. The
percentage of missing data for the covariates was low in
our cohorts. The variable with the highest percentage of
missing data was smoking in the HPFS (6.1%) and fruit/
vegetable intake in the NHS (15.7%) at baseline. We have
created a separate missing value category for the covariates
with missing values. Analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical package (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). All P values were calculated based on 2-sided tests
and were considered statistically significant at P < .05.

RESULTS
During the 14 years of follow-up among 80,782 woman
(933,361 person-years) and the 16 years of follow-up
among 37,869 men (455,910 person-years), we documented a total of 277 RCC cases (164 women and 113
men) with information on statin use. The prevalence of
statin use climbed gradually from 4% in 1994 to 39% in
2006 in the NHS and from 4% 1990 to 38% in 2004 in
the HPFS.
Table 1 provides data indicated that statin users
tended to be older, to have a higher BMI, to exercise less,
and to be past smokers. Compared with nonusers, regular
users of statin were more likely to have comorbidities,
such as hypertension and diabetes, and to use nonaspirin
NSAIDs.
Overall, current use of statins was not associated
with the risk of RCC for either women or men in age-

adjusted analysis (Table 2). Among the covariates we considered in multivariate models, a history of hypertension
had the strongest impact on the RRs in both cohorts.
Thus, the results adjusting for age and hypertension are
presented separately. Adjustment of hypertension had a
similar impact of reducing RRs in both cohorts. Additional adjustment for other covariates further reduced the
RRs. The RR for women became marginally statistically
significant (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-1.00).

use, >0-<4, 4-<10, 10 years), and parity (nulliparous, 1-2, 3, 4, or 5
children) in women.

We also evaluated never use versus ever use of statins
during follow-up as well as the duration of use (<4 years vs
4 years) among ever users (Table 3). There was no statistically significant association between ever users of statins
and the risk of RCC in age-adjusted analysis of both
women and men. We observed a similar magnitude and
direction of confounding by hypertension that was
observed in the analysis evaluating current use of statins;
the RRs were reduced after we adjusted for hypertension in
the cohorts. When we adjusted for multiple risk factors for
RCC, the RRs in both cohorts were further reduced. However, none of the RRs were statistically significant. Duration of statin use also was not associated with RCC risk.
We examined baseline statin use without updating
the evolving exposure status during follow-up and
observed no association between statin use and RCC incidence in either cohort (data not shown). When we
excluded RCC cases from the first 2 years of follow-up (n
¼ 24 in the NHS and n ¼ 12 in the HPFS), the results
did not change materially (data not shown).
Because history of hypertension was an important
confounder of the association, we stratified the association
between current use of statins and RCC risk by history of
hypertension (Table 4). Because of a strong, positive correlation between history of hypertension and statin use,
there were much smaller numbers of cases among those
with no history of hypertension. Among those with no
history of hypertension, current use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of RCC among women. A similar
inverse association was observed among men with no history of hypertension, although the corresponding RR was
not statistically significant.

The models were adjusted for the same covariates as in Table 2 except history of hypertension.

Finally, we evaluated the associations between regular use of statin drugs and overall kidney cancer risk (198
cases in women and 136 in men), including tumors of the
renal pelvis and ureter in addition to RCC, and the results
were similar to those for RCC (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In these large, prospective studies, there was some suggestion that current use of statins was associated with a
reduced risk of RCC among women. The association was
statistically significant among women with no history of
hypertension. In men, there was the suggestion of a
reduced risk only among those with no history of hypertension. We also observed that the duration of statin use
was not associated with RCC risk.
Experimental data suggested that statins can suppress proliferation, induce apoptosis, and inhibit metastasis of RCC in a murine model.28,29 One of the hallmarks
of cancer is enhanced angiogenesis, and RCC is 1 of the
most angiogenic tumors.30 Currently available data suggest that statins have both proangiogenic and antiangiogenic properties, and it is possible that both these
opposing effects on tumor vessel growth explain the overall null result in our study on the increased incidence of
RCC.31 Conversely, and despite an antiproliferative
effect, statins can exhibit immune tolerance-promoting
properties, suggesting an opposing effect on tumor development.32 In 2 case-control studies,10,11 1 cohort study,12
and a subgroup analysis for 1 clinical trial,13 no association was reported between statin use and RCC risk. However, 211,13 of those studies had sample sizes of <50
patients with RCC and, thus, had limited statistical power
to detect any association. Only 1 of the studies provided
sex-specific results, which were nonsignificant.12 ConCancer

versely, a decreased risk of RCC (odds ratio, 0.52; 95%
CI, 0.45-0.60) was observed in a nested case-control study
of US veterans that included 1446 patients with RCC.7
Greater than 90% of the participants in that study were
men who were veterans. Another nested case-control
study among patients with cardiovascular disease8 also
reported a significantly reduced risk of kidney cancer
(odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.95) among 101
patients who had kidney cancer. However, in a cohort
study, Friedman et al9 reported a 23% increased risk of
kidney cancer associated with the use of statins among
men (n ¼ 135), but not among women (n ¼ 51), in the
United States. Therefore, previous data on statin use and
RCC risk were limited, mixed, and inconclusive. Most of
these previous studies (except 1 study12), did not adjust
for history of hypertension, which was a strong confounder of the association between statin use and RCC
risk in our current study. Because hypertension is a strong
risk factor for RCC and is strongly correlated with the use
of statins, it is an important confounder of the association
between statins and RCC and needs to be taken into
account. Our investigation of 2 prospective studies supports some inverse association between statin use and
RCC risk, especially among women and those with no
history of hypertension.
Our study had some limitations. First, despite the
finding that our study participants were registered nurses
and men who were health professionals and were familiar
with prescription drugs, there was a potential—although
minimal—misclassification of statin use because of the
use of self-reported data. However, exposure misclassification because of inaccurate self-reporting should not be different with respect to the diagnosis of RCC because the
cancer analysis was made prospectively. Further misclassification of exposure could be introduced; because, in the

801

Original Article

current study, any use of cholesterol-lowering drugs represented statin use during a certain period of follow-up (eg,
before 2000) in the analysis. However, >90% of participants in both cohorts who reported use of cholesterollowering drugs used statins. There also is little evidence to
support an association between nonstatin lipid-lowering
drugs and RCC risk. Thus, it is unlikely that such misclassification could have a significant impact on our estimates.
The existence of exposure misclassification would make
our estimation more conservative (toward null) and may
not explain the associations we observed. Second, our
study was limited by the relatively small number of
exposed cases and the absence of information on the potency, hydrophobic status, and dosage of statins, which
limited our ability to precisely examine any dose-response
relation and to differentiate the effect between lipophilic
versus hydrophilic statins, because the later class may be
more likely to be carcinogenic. Third, although confounding by indication may not be entirely ruled out, it is
unlikely to bias the association, because increased serum
cholesterol levels are unrelated to risk for RCC.15 Fourth,
we lacked information on potential confounders, such as
family history of kidney cancer. Finally, our study population is largely white, and our results may not be generalizable to other racial populations, although there is no
reason to assume that the association would differ biologically by race.
We also had several strengths in our study. First, the
prospective design avoided biases related to case-control
studies, including biased recall of statin use. We also took
advantage of repeated measures of statin use over a long follow-up period, which was a unique feature of our study that
minimized the misclassification of statin use and enabled us
to evaluate both baseline and updated use of statins. Finally,
we had information on many suspected and known risk factors of RCC, including history of hypertension, which
turned out to be an important confounder, and we took it
into consideration in multivariate analyses.
In summary, these prospective data provided some
evidence of a beneficial effect from statin use on the risk of
RCC, especially among women. Further analysis with
longer duration of follow-up and more accurate exposure
assessment is required to address 1) the diverse antitumor
effects in men and women and 2) the effect of different
types and doses of statins on the risk of RCC.
