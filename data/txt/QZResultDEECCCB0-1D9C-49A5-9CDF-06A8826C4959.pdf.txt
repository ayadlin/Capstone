BACKGROUND: Glioma cells secrete glutamate and also express a-amino-3-hydroxy-5 methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
(AMPA) glutamate receptors, which contribute to the proliferation, migration, and neurotoxicity of malignant gliomas.
Talampanel is an oral AMPA receptor inhibitor with excellent central nervous system penetration and good tolerability
in clinical trials for epilepsy and other neurologic disorders. METHODS: A phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate the
efficacy of talampanel in patients with recurrent malignant glioma as measured by 6-month progression-free survival
(PFS6). RESULTS: Thirty patients (22 with glioblastomas [GBMs] and 8 with anaplastic gliomas [AGs]; 63% men) with
median age of 51 years (range, 20-67 years) and a median Karnofsky performance scale of 80 were included.
Patients tolerated treatment well, and most adverse events were mild and reversible; the most common toxicities
were fatigue (27%), dizziness (23%), and ataxia (17%). There was only 1 partial response (5%) reported in the GBM
stratum and none among AG patients. At a median follow-up of 13 months, 28 patients (93%) had died. The PFS6
was 4.6% for the initial 22 GBM patients, and the study was terminated early due to treatment futility; the PFS6 was
0% for 8 AG patients. The median PFS was 5.9 weeks for GBM and 8.9 weeks for AG patients. The median overall survival was 13 weeks for GBM patients and 14 months for AG patients. CONCLUSIONS: Talampanel was well-tolerated
but had no significant activity as a single agent in unselected recurrent malignant gliomas. Cancer 2010;116:1776–82.

Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, with an estimated incidence of 15,000 cases yearly
in the United States.1 Glioblastomas (GBMs; grade 4) account for approximately 70% of malignant gliomas, whereas anaplastic or grade 3 gliomas (AGs) are less frequent and include 3 main subtypes: anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas.1,2 Patients with malignant gliomas almost always experience tumor
progression or recurrence despite multimodal therapy with surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.2 Conventional chemotherapy has only modest benefits in patients with recurrent malignant glioma; therefore, there is a great need
for novel targeted therapies.
In vitro and in vivo experimental studies have shown that glioma cells release high levels of glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, into the extracellular space.3-5 Moreover, glioma cells lack transporters for glutamate
reuptake into the intracellular space.6,7 Excess glutamate is known to cause neurotoxicity and potentially neuronal death
through a mechanism called excitotoxicity.8 Furthermore, evidence suggests that glioma-mediated glutamate release can
facilitate glioma progression and invasion.3 In fact, suppression of glutamate release in an orthotopic glioma mice model
decreased vasogenic edema, delayed the onset of neurologic deficits, and prolonged survival.9 In a complementary manner, restoration of excitatory transporter-2, a glutamate reuptake transporter, induced apoptosis and suppressed glioma
growth in vitro and in vivo.6

Talampanel for Recurrent Gliomas/Iwamoto et al

Surgical samples of gliomas express a-amino-3hydroxy-5 methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type
glutamate receptors in most GBMs and AGs.10,11 One
study demonstrated that intracellular calcium influx
through AMPA receptors activates the protein serine-threonine kinase Akt, a key regulator of glioma survival and
proliferation.12 Conversely, inactivation of calcium-permeable AMPA glutamate receptors induces tumor cell apoptosis and suppresses mitotic activity in glioma mouse
models.10,11 Therefore, the calcium permeable AMPA receptor is an attractive therapeutic target for malignant
gliomas as this receptor is central to a positive feedback
loop whereby elevated glutamate release and decreased
glutamate uptake promotes tumor proliferation and more
glutamate release.
Talampanel is a potent orally available noncompetitive antagonist of AMPA receptors with excellent penetration through the blood-brain barrier.13 Talampanel has
already undergone phase 1 and 2 trials for refractory epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease.13-15 Talampanel is well-tolerated with the most
common toxicities being dizziness, ataxia, and drowsiness.
Given that prior talampanel studies have tested various
doses of talampanel alone and in combination with other
types of antiepileptic drugs (AED),13-15 we used these
established dosages in our phase 2 trial for recurrent malignant gliomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients aged 18 years with histologically confirmed
malignant glioma and unequivocal radiographic tumor
progression after prior radiotherapy were eligible. Additional eligibility criteria included Karnofsky performance
scale (KPS)  60, adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin 10 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count 1500/
mm3, platelet count 100,000/mm3), adequate liver
function (bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase  2
times the upper limit of normal), adequate renal function
(creatinine <1.5 mg/dL or measured 24-hour creatinine
clearance 60 mL/minute), and life expectancy >8
weeks. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from radiotherapy, 4 weeks from any investigational agent or cytotoxic
drugs; 6 weeks from nitrosureas; 3 weeks from procarbazine; 2 weeks from vincristine; and 1 week from noncytotoxic agents such as interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,
and cis-retinoic acid. Patients could undergo resection for
recurrent disease before enrollment, and residual disease

was not required for eligibility. There were no limits on
the number of prior therapies, and patients had to be
receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least 5 days
before obtaining their baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Patients with significant cardiac, hepatic,
renal, or psychiatric diseases; active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics; or another active malignancy were
ineligible. Patients who were pregnant or nursing were
ineligible, and birth control methods were required for
both men and women during and for 2 months after treatment with talampanel. All participants signed a written
informed consent approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.
Treatment Plan
Patients were treated with talampanel orally 3 times a day
on 6-week cycles without planned interruptions. Prior trials for refractory epilepsy had demonstrated significantly
faster talampanel metabolism in patients treated with concurrent use of enzyme-inducing AEDs (EIAEDs), whereas
valproic acid (VPA) inhibited its metabolism. Based on
these data, 3 different dosing schedules have been established: 1) patients receiving EIAEDs but not receiving
VPA received 35 mg 3 times a day on Week 1, 50 mg 3
times a day on Week 2, and 75 mg 3 times a day starting
on Week 3; 2) patients not receiving EIAEDs or VPA
received 25 mg 3 times a day on Week 1, 35 mg 3 times a
day on Week 2, and 50 mg 3 times a day starting on Week
3; 3) patients receiving VPA received 10 mg 3 times a day
on Week 1, 25 mg 3 times a day on Week 2, and 35 mg 3
times a day starting on Week 3. If patients required a
change in AED during study, every effort was made to
switch to the same class of AED or adjustments in the
talampanel dose were required. History, physical, and
neurologic exam were performed every 3 weeks for the
first cycle and every 6 weeks thereafter. Complete blood
count and comprehensive metabolic panel were performed every 3 weeks and AED levels every 6 weeks, if applicable. Brain MRI was repeated every 6 weeks, before
each cycle. Toxicity was evaluated using the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Dose reductions were allowed for patients who experienced toxicity  grade 3 related to talampanel.
Endpoints
This study had 2 strata according to histologic diagnosis:
GBM and AG. The primary endpoint of this single-stage,
phase 2 trial was 6-month progression-free survival
(PFS6) for each stratum. Progression-free survival (PFS)

was calculated from study registration until the earliest of
either date of radiographic progression, date off study for
clinical decline, or start date of new therapy if off study for
reason other than tumor progression. All other patients
were censored at date of last follow-up if they had not
developed disease progression. Overall survival (OS) was
calculated from study registration until date of death or
patients were censored for OS as of the last date known to
be alive.16 Radiographic response was assessed with standard criteria using the largest cross-sectional dimensions of
measurable lesions,17 or scored evaluations of nonmeasurable but evaluable disease.18 Determinations of complete
or partial response required stable or decreasing dose of
corticosteroids.
Statistical Analysis
We used historical data from 8 consecutive phase 2 clinical trials for recurrent malignant gliomas that were
deemed negative and demonstrated a PFS6 of 15% (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 10-19%) for GBM and a
PFS6 of 31% (95% CI, 24-39%) for AG.19 For the GBM
stratum, the ineffective rate (P0) was set to 20% and the
targeted effective rate (P1) was set to 35%. For the AG
stratum, P0 was set to 40% and P1 was set to 55%. The
initial plan was to accrue 41 GBM and 50 AG patients;
this single-stage design had a false-positive rate (a)  10%
and a false-negative rate (b)  20%. Talampanel would
be considered effective if >11 of 41 GBM patients or
>24 of 50 AG patients had not developed disease progression at 6 months. The Clopper and Pearson interval was
used to calculate 95% CIs for response rates and PFS6.
Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the time
to event distributions for PFS and OS. An early look for
futility based on a conditional power calculation20 was
planned after half of the GBM or AG patients were enrolled. Conditional power was based on simple binomial
calculations. Statistical analyses were performed with
STATA software (version 10.0) for Macintosh (StataCorp, College Station, Tex) and SPLUS statistical software (version 7.0; Insightful Software, Seattle, Wash).

and a median KPS of 80 were accrued. The median time
from initial malignant glioma diagnosis to enrollment was
15 months (range, 5-88 months), and all patients had
undergone prior radiotherapy and had received a median
of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens before enrollment. Six
patients underwent resection of recurrent tumor with a
median of 6 weeks (range, 3.4-10.6 weeks) before enrollment. Fifteen patients (50%) were receiving EIAED and
1 patient was receiving VPA (Table 1).
Toxicity
Patients tolerated treatment well, and adverse events were
usually mild and reversible. The most common toxicities
were fatigue, dizziness, and ataxia (Table 2). All patients
tolerated the planned talampanel titration, except for 1
patient who required dose reduction for dizziness and
ataxia. One patient, who was also receiving corticosteroids, developed hyperglycemia that was controlled with
insulin.
Outcomes
All 30 patients met eligibility criteria, received at least 1
dose of talampanel, and were included in an intent-totreat analysis for PFS and OS. Twenty-five patients had

follow-up scans and were evaluable for objective radiographic response (ORR). Twenty-five (83%) patients
received  1 6-week cycle of talampanel and 29 (97%)
discontinued treatment due to progressive disease (Table
3). At the time of last follow-up, all 30 patients had tumor
progression, and 28 (93%) had died; the median followup of surviving patients was 13 months.
There was only 1 partial response noted (5%, 95%
CI, 0.1-26%) (Fig. 1) among 19 evaluable patients in the
GBM stratum and no ORR among 6 evaluable AG
patients. The best ORR was progressive disease in 19
patients, whereas 5 patients had stable disease for a median of 6 weeks (range, 4-12 weeks). The PFS6 was 4.6%
(95% CI, 0.1-23%) for the initial 22 GBM patients, and
the study was terminated early due to treatment futility;
the PFS6 was 0% for 8 AG patients. The median PFS was
5.9 weeks (95% CI, 4.6-6 weeks) (Fig. 2A) for the GBM
patients and 8.9 weeks (95% CI, 4.4-12.1 weeks) for the
AG patients. The median OS was 13 weeks (95% CI, 9.525.6 weeks) (Fig. 2B) for the GBM patients and 14
months for AG patients.

Postgadolinium T1-weighted image after 2 cycles of talampanel demonstrated a partial response.

We conducted a conditional power calculation after
approximately half the targeted sample size of GBM
patients met the PFS6 endpoint. For the GBM group, we
computed the probability of concluding that the treatment would meet the criterion for an effective therapy (P1
¼ PFS6 of 35%), after 21 patients met the PFS6 endpoint. The conditional power was calculated as 3.5%; this
low probability indicated that continuing accrual to the
GBM group would likely be futile. A similar conditional
power calculation for the AG group demonstrated that
the conditional power for this group after only 8 patients
met the PFS6 endpoint was only 0.33. This probability
along with the overall low PFS6 suggested that continuing
to accrual to this group would be futile.

DISCUSSION
Our phase 2 results demonstrate that talampanel had minimal activity as a single agent in unselected patients with

recurrent malignant gliomas, as evidenced by a PFS6 of
only 4.6% in the GBM cohort and early trial termination
for futility. Only 1 patient with recurrent GBM had a partial response and a PFS of 35 weeks compared with median historical control of 9 weeks.19 It is likely, however,
that this patient did represent a true talampanel-mediated
antitumor response, because the patient was enrolled on
the trial 9 months after completing radiotherapy, thereby
making pseudoprogression at enrollment unlikely. Furthermore, a pretalampanel positron emission tomography
scan and magnetic resonance perfusion scans demonstrated the gadolinium-enhancing area on the prestudy
MRI scan to be hypermetabolic and to have high cerebral
blood flow, respectively, consistent with recurrent tumor.
Nevertheless, despite this apparent response, the overall
efficacy of talampanel in this patient population was disappointing and consistent with the results of previous neg-

1780

ative trials for recurrent GBM that cumulatively reported
a PFS6 of 9%16,21 to 15%.19
Prior studies in patients with epilepsy have defined
the maximum tolerated doses of talampanel used in our
study. These prior studies demonstrated the need to adjust
dose based on the concurrent use of EIAED and VPA.1315
At the doses used in this study, talampanel was well-tolerated in this population. The major drug-related adverse
events were mild and included fatigue, dizziness, and
ataxia, events that are comparable to prior talampanel
studies in patients with epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.13-15 Dizziness and ataxia usually resolve after a
few weeks of initiating talampanel secondary to tachyphylaxis to these side effects. Only 1 patient required dose
reduction, and no patient discontinued treatment due to
toxicity. We were unable to evaluate any potential longterm side effects from talampanel because the median
time on treatment was short due to early tumor
progression.
Our disappointing results may be due to 1 or more
of several factors. It is possible that the relative lack of clinical benefit observed with talampanel was secondary to
the finding that our patients had been moderately pretreated (median of 2 prior treatment regimens). Nevertheless, there is no obvious biological reason to believe that
resistance to prior chemotherapy would predict tumor resistance to the presumptive antitumor mechanism of glutamate inhibition. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the
overall health of these patients can explain the lack of benefit from talampanel because the overall KPS of this
patient population was good and a similar group of
patients (median of 2.5 prior treatments) treated with
bevacizumab at our institution demonstrated that radiographic responses and prolongation of PFS6 can be
observed in this general patient population when an active
treatment is used.22
There may be underlying biological reasons why
talampanel failed to demonstrate significant antitumor activity in this trial. It is well known that gliomas have multiple signaling pathways, which often limits the activity of
single-agent targeted therapies.2 Glutamate interacts with
other targets not affected by talampanel, including Nmethyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, which are
present in cancer cells and may be involved in pathways
that promote tumor survival.23 Moreover, compensatory
mechanisms can develop after attempts to inhibit glutamate pathways such as compensatory up-regulated expression of AMPA receptors in glioma cell lines.9 It is also
possible that glutamate inhibition alone does not have

clinically significant efficacy but can improve response to
standard cytotoxic therapy. Consistent with such an effect
was a recently completed phase 2 trial of talampanel combined with standard radiotherapy and temozolomide in
72 newly diagnosed GBM patients,24 which demonstrated a median survival of 20.3 months compared with a
historical control of 14.6 months noted with radiotherapy
and temozolomide.25 Finally, it remains plausible that,
despite the preclinical data, human gliomas in situ are not
inhibited by AMPA receptor blockade. Other researchers
as well as ourselves have demonstrated that the traditional
preclinical glioma models (ie, glioma cell lines) used in
many of the glutamate inhibition studies differ both
genomically and biologically (ie, relative lack of tumor
infiltration of traditional glioma cell lines) from true
human primary gliomas.26,27 Thus, the experimental
observations made with glutamate inhibition using standard glioma preclinical models may not be relevant to primary human gliomas in situ.
Talampanel was well-tolerated, but its limited activity does not support further investigation of this drug as a
single agent in unselected recurrent malignant glioma
patients. The selection of patients for targeted therapies,
such as glutamate inhibition, remains challenging because
of tumor heterogeneity and lack of reliable biomarkers to
predict response. Sulfasalazine, an approved drug for
inflammatory bowel disease, is known to inhibit glutamate release by glioma cells and decrease glioma invasion
and growth in orthotopic animal models.28,29 Phase 1 and
2 clinical trials with single-agent sulfasalazine are ongoing
for recurrent malignant gliomas and will provide further
information regarding the value of inhibiting the glutamate pathways in these patients.30,31 Additional preclinical studies are needed to validate the glutamate pathway as
a bona fide therapeutic target using more accurate preclinical models of human glioma, to identify possible molecular predictors of response to glutamate pathway inhibitors
and to better understand of underlying mechanisms of
treatment failure.
