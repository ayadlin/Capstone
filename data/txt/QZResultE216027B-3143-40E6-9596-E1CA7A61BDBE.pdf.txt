ABSTRACT
In addition to local cytotoxic activity, radiotherapy may also elicit local and
systemic antitumor immunity, which may be augmented by immunotherapeutic agents
including Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonists. Here, we investigated the ability
of 3M-011 (854A), a TLR7/8 agonist, to boost the antigen-presenting activity of
dendritic cells (DC) as an adjuvant to radiotherapy. The combined treatment induced
marked local and systemic responses in subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models
of colorectal and pancreatic cancer. In vitro cytotoxicity assays as well as in vivo
depletion experiments with monoclonal antibodies identified NK and CD8 T cells as
the cell populations mediating the cytotoxic effects of the treatment, while in vivo
depletion of CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice revealed DC
as the pivotal immune hub in this setting. The specificity of the immune reaction was
confirmed by ELISPOT assays. TLR7/8 agonists therefore seem to be potent adjuvants
to radiotherapy, inducing strong local and profound systemic immune responses to
tumor antigens released by conventional therapy.

INTRODUCTION

adenocarcinoma, PDAC) is even worse [2]. Traditional
systemic therapies are often unable to eradicate all tumor
cells and hence usually cannot provide a cure. In contrast,
immunotherapy may be able to definitively eradicate the
tumor as it does not target the tumor directly but induces
an immune response to tumor antigens in general.
Among the currently most successfully used

While considerable progress has been made in
the therapy of colorectal cancer (CRC), the prognosis
of metastatic CRC is still often unfavorable [1]. The
prognosis for pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal

immunotherapeutics are imidazoquinoline derivatives,
most notably imiquimod (Aldara® cream), a selective
TLR7 agonist, which can be topically used in malignant
and premalignant skin lesions and shows considerable
response rates [3]. TLR are pattern recognition receptors
involved in the sensing of structurally conserved
molecules derived from microbes and therefore
predominantly expressed on immune cells, most notably
APC (such as DC and macrophages) and effector cells
of both the innate and adaptive immune system (such as
macrophages, NK cells, B cells and cytotoxic T cells).
Upon antigen contact and TLR activation, these cells show
increased proliferation, cytokine secretion, costimulatory
molecule expression, phagocytic activity and antigen
presentation [4]. The agent used in the present work, 3M011, an agonist for TLR7/8, is soluble in aqueous buffers
and can therefore be administered systemically [5,6]. 3M011 does not activate mouse TLR8, thus acting as a TLR7
agonist only in the murine setting [5].
Tumor vaccines generally aim to induce antigenspecific humoral (B cell-based) or cytotoxic (T cellbased) immune responses. As the response to the antigen
is usually insufficient to induce clinically relevant and
durable immune responses, numerous adjuvants have been
evaluated [7]. TLR agonists strongly increase APC activity
and priming of the adaptive immune system, resulting in
augmented responses to the vaccine and thus seem to be
suitable adjuvants [8]. TLR7 and TLR8 are expressed in
plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid (mDC) dendritic cells,
respectively. Upon activation, mDC produce various
proinflammatory cytokines, show increased antigen
phagocytosis and processing and prime CD8 and CD4 T
cells [9]. pDC produce high amounts of type 1 INF and
thus boost the activity of CD8 T cells and NK cells [10].
Radiotherapy is a mainstay in the treatment of many
solid tumors including gastrointestinal tumors. Data from
multiple cancer models have provided sufficient evidence
to propose a paradigm shift, whereby some of the effects
of ionizing radiation are recognized as contributing not
only to local tumor control but also to local and systemic
antitumor immunity [11–14]. The underlying radiation
effects include the induction of a pro-inflammatory
microenvironment within the tumor, as well as the release
of tumor antigens which can subsequently be processed
and presented by APC, thus acting as an intrinsic tumor
vaccination. As opposed to classical tumor vaccination,
which usually induces an immune reaction against a
single, tumor-specific antigen, the radiation-induced
immune reaction is directed against multiple epitopes.
As tumors are immensely heterogeneous, this polyclonal
immune response may prevent tumors from evading
eradication by downregulating the antigens targeted by
the immune system. Both ionizing radiation and proinflammatory drugs such as TLR ligands may therefore
be able to synergistically contribute to the eradication of
tumors by the immune system [15,16].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the present study, we therefore aimed to
investigate the effects of a combination of the TLR7
agonist 3M-011 and fractionated radiation therapy.
We hypothesized that the TLR ligand might increase
processing and presentation of antigens released by
concomitant radiation, therefore acting as an adjuvant
to the vaccination effect of radiotherapy (Fig. 1). We
demonstrated the effectiveness of the therapy combination
and identified the involved immune cell populations and
subsequently investigated their role by selective in vivo
depletion.

RESULTS
As previous reports had indicated an involvement
of TLR signaling in tumorigenesis [17], we first evaluated
the effects of the TLR7/8 agonist on various tumor cell
lines. We therefore performed WST proliferation assays
on murine and human tumor cell lines of CRC and PDAC
and found that 3M-011 had only minimal and divergent
effects on tumor cell proliferation in vitro and only at
concentrations unattainable in vivo (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Of note, there was no direct radiosensitizing effect of 3M011.

When combined with ionizing radiation, 3M011 effectively inhibits the growth of syngeneic
colorectal and pancreatic tumors and can cause
complete remissions
To investigate the effects of the TLR7/8 agonist
in combination with classical fractionated photon
radiotherapy in vivo, we induced tumor homografts by
subcutaneous implantation of CT26 tumor fragments in
immunocompetent BALB/c mice. Treatment with 3M011, fractionated local irradiation (Rx, targeted to the
subcutaneous tumor) or the combination of both started
when the tumors were established, growing and about
50 mm³ in size. Vigorous tumor growth required the
euthanasia of vehicle-treated mice in the control group by
day 14 after the start of treatment. Significantly reduced
tumor volume was noted in the 3M-011 monotherapy
group (p<0.01, Fig. 2A). Unsurprisingly, the 5x 2
Gy radiotherapy regime also reduced tumor volumes
(p<0.001) and induced complete remissions in ~20% of the
animals. The combination of both 3M-011 and radiation
showed complete remission of the tumors in 50% of the
mice (p<0.001 vs. control group, p=0.0003 for Rx + 3M011 vs. Rx alone). The combination group also showed at
least additive activity in local control rates, yielding local
control in 50% of the mice (х² = 11.2, p<0.01 for twosided tests). In addition, tumor growth delay (TGD, for
5-fold of the starting volume) was calculated. TGD was
1.58 days for 3M-011 and 6.11 days for Rx (average time
to reach 5-fold tumor volume: control 6.89 (4-14) days,

3M-011 8.47 (2-16) days, Rx 13.0 (2-28) days). TGD
for the combination treatment could not be calculated
as tumors never reached 5-fold of their starting volume,
in both monotherapy groups some tumors did not reach
5-fold of their volume during the course of the experiment.
We next tested the treatment combination in a
subcutaneous model of pancreatic cancer by implanting
syngeneic Panc-02 tumor fragments subcutaneously into
C57Bl/6 mice. Treatment was again initiated after the
establishment of local tumors. In this tumor model, the
effects of the 3M-011 monotherapy were less pronounced
than in CT26 tumors. Nevertheless, the combination
treatment showed a statistically significant inhibition of
growth of the tumors (p<0.05) and the addition of 3M-011
to radiotherapy produced a statistically significant increase
in treatment efficacy over irradiation alone (p<0.05, Fig.
2B). TGD (due to the slower growth of Panc-02 tumors
as compared to CT26 tumors calculated for 3-fold of the
starting volume) was 3.32 days for 3M-011, 1.44 days for
Rx and 6.12 days for the combined treatment (average
time to 3-fold tumor volume: control 4.35 (2-11) days,

3M-11 7.67 (4-18) days, Rx 5.79 (2-16) days, 3M-011 +
Rx 10.47 (2-23) days).

Treatment with 3M-011 and radiation inhibits
tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic
pancreatic cancer
In gastrointestinal tumors, the survival of patients
is often limited by metastases rather than by the primary
tumor itself. Subcutaneous models are mostly models for
primary tumor growth. We therefore tested the radio-/
immunotherapy combination in a syngeneic, orthotopic
mouse model of pancreatic cancer that serves as a model
for both local tumor growth and lymph node metastasis
[18].
As in the subcutaneous models, we observed a
significant reduction in tumor growth achieved by TLR
agonist monotherapy (p<0.05). Radiation therapy was
delivered to an epigastric target field and also significantly
reduced the tumor volume and weight at the end of the
experiments (p<0.05). The combination treatment

3M-011 activates NK cells indirectly via
monocyte-derived IL-6

performed significantly better than each monotherapy
(p<0.01, Fig. 2C).
The tumors in this mouse model regularly
metastasize to mesenteric lymph nodes of the small
intestine. The metastatic activity of the primary tumor can
be measured by quantification of mesenteric lymph node
metastases aligned along the blood vessels. The tumors
treated with 3M-011 alone showed a reduced metastatic
activity, but failed to reach statistical significance.
(33±24% reduction, n=8-10, n.s.). When combined with
radiation therapy, this effect was significantly more
pronounced (73±21% reduction as compared to radiation
alone, 91±7% reduction as compared to the control group,
n=8-10, p<0.05 (dual treatment vs Rx alone), p<0.0001
(dual treatment vs. control), Fig. 2D - F).
In addition to the postmortem measurements, in
vivo FDG-PET imaging was performed on selected mice
from all groups. A decline in metabolic activity in the
epigastric target areas was noted in animals treated with
both radiation and TLR agonist. Due to the low number of
animals subjected to PET imaging, statistical analysis was
not feasible (Supplemental Fig. 2).

As 3M-011 had minimal direct effects on tumor
cells, we concluded that the antitumor effects in vivo
were indirect in nature. Previous reports had indicated a
pivotal role of NK cells in the treatment with TLR agonists
[5], however, the role of other immune cell populations
during treatment with TLR7/8 or together with radiation
combinations remained unknown.
To further investigate the tumor/immune-cell
interaction during treatment with 3M-011, we first
performed 51Cr release cytotoxicity assays on human
PBMC stimulated with various doses of 3M-011. The TLR
ligand dose-dependently increased the cytotoxic activity
of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
on HT-29 CRC tumor cells (Fig. 3A). We next aimed to
identify the immune cell subpopulations contained within
the PBMC fraction responsible for this cytotoxic response.
As previous reports indicated a pivotal role of NK cells in
the effects of 3M-011 in vivo [5], we performed MACS
isolation of CD56+ NK cells from PBMC and evaluated
their response to the TLR ligand in cytotoxicity assays.

In addition to the expectedly increased baseline cytotoxic
activity compared to unselected PBMC, NK cells also
showed a marked response to 3M-011. Conversely, the
cytotoxic activity and response to 3M-011 of CD56depleted PBMC was markedly reduced (Fig. 3B).
Previous reports indicated that invariant NK cells
could not directly be activated by TLR7/8 ligands although
they do express TLR 7 [19]. The authors showed that
monocyte-derived DC are required for the activation of
NK cells by a TLR7/8 agonist. To test this hypothesis with
3M-011, we first isolated highly purified (>98% purity as
opposed to ~90% after MACS purification) CD56+ NK
cells by FACS sorting. These cells were subsequently
used in the cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 3C) and exhibited
increasing target cell lysis with increasing effector:target
cell ratios. However, the addition of the TLR ligand to
the culture medium did not cause any significant increase
in cytotoxicity. As NK cells with relatively low purity
(~90%) responded to 3M-011 stimulation whereas highly
purified (>98%) NK cells did not, we hypothesized that costimulation by a subpopulation in the contaminating cell
fraction of the MACS-purified NK cells must be required
for NK cells to respond to 3M-011. As previous reports
indicated that this contaminating fraction may be cells of
the monocytic lineage [19], we artificially contaminated
FACS-sorted (i.e., highly purified) NK cells with PBMCderived monocytes in various ratios and tested the cell
mixture for its antitumor cytotoxicity. Fig. 3D shows that
a contaminating monocyte fraction of 10% was required
to elicit a cytotoxic response to 3M-011.
To test whether this effect was caused by direct
cell-cell interaction or an indirect paracrine effect,
we incubated monocytes with 3M-011, collected the
supernatants und subsequently incubated FACS-sorted NK
cells with the monocyte supernatants. Untreated monocyte
supernatants were not able to significantly increase the
NK cell cytotoxity. However, when pre-treated with
3M-011, the monocyte supernatants dose-dependently
stimulated NK cell toxicity (Fig. 3E). ELISA analysis of
the monocyte supernatants revealed a marked increase in
IL-6 levels upon TLR stimulation, which may explain the
increased NK cell activity [20,21].

depleted (ND), NK cell depleted (NK), CD8 T cell
depleted (CD8) and combined depletion (NK + CD8)) and
pre-treated with the depletion mAbs according to protocol
(Fig. 4A). After the inoculation of orthotopic pancreatic
tumors, each group was then randomly divided into 4
subgroups (vehicle, 3M-011, Rx (5x2 Gy), 3M-011 +
Rx) and treated as indicated. Radiation therapy was again
delivered in five 2 Gy fractions to an epigastric target field.
Tumor inoculation and data collection at the end of the
experiment were carried out following the protocol of the
orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.
In mice treated with either vehicle or 3M-011
monotherapy, the effects of 3M-011 appeared to be based
on the presence of both NK and CD8 T cells (Fig. 4C). In
the groups depleted of either cell population, the efficacy
of 3M-011 was reduced by about 50-70% compared to
non-depleted (ND) mice (p<0.05 for both comparisons).
In the double-depleted group, 3M-011 had no measurable
antitumor effect.
Interestingly, the anti-tumor effects of the
combination of TLR7/8 agonist and radiation appeared
to be entirely mediated by CD8 T cells. The efficacy
of 3M-011 treatment in the combination group was not
affected by NK cell depletion, as the results in the dual
depleted group were identical to the results of the CD8
depleted group. In mice depleted of CD8 T cells, however,
the addition of 3M-011 to radiation therapy produced no
additional effects.

CD11c+ dendritic cell-mediated NK and T-cell
priming is required for the effects of the treatment
combination
Since both CD8 T cells and NK cells are dependent
on previous activation by antigen-presenting cells such as
DC, we aimed to investigate the role of DC by selectively
depleting these cells in tumor-bearing and treated mice. To
this end, we used CD11c.DOG mice, which allow selective
and long-term depletion of CD11c+ DC without otherwise
affecting the animals [24]. CD11c.DOG are transgenic
mice, expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)
under control of the CD11c promoter. All CD11c+ cells in
these mice express DTR and can therefore be selectively
ablated by systemic administration of diphtheria toxin
(DT). We used the orthotopic Panc-02 model in C57Bl/6
CD11c.DOG mice. To exclude effects of DT on tumor
cells, we used wild-type C57Bl/6 mice as controls and
treated them with DT in the same manner as the CD11c.
DOG mice. Each group of mice (C57Bl/6, CD11c.DOG)
was then divided in to the 4 treatment groups (vehicle,
3M-011, Rx, 3M-011 + Rx) and treated as indicated (Fig.
4B). The radiation was again targeted to the epigastrium
including the entire pancreas.
Tumor growth and metastasis in DT treated wildtype mice was similar to non-DT-treated mice. Tumor

Tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells are the mediators
of the effects of combined radio-immunotherapy
To determine the main effectors of the in vivo
antitumor activity, we next depleted wild-type C57Bl/6
mice of either NK cells or CD8 T cells by monoclonal
antibody injection (PK136 for NK cells, 53-6.72 for CD8
T cells), as described previously [22,23]. The efficacy
and durability of the depletion was repeatedly verified by
FACS analyses of mouse blood samples throughout the
experiment (Supplemental Fig. 3).
Healthy mice were divided into 4 groups (nonwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to both treatment modalities was also consistent
with previous results. In CD11c.DOG mice, however, DC
ablation led to a near complete abolition of the effects of
3M-011 (Fig. 4D). The effects of radiation alone were also
reduced by about 50% (data not shown). Similarly, DC
depletion markedly reduced the anti-tumor effects in the
combination group of 3M-011 and radiation.
The strong effects of the treatment combination
in the previous experiments were indicative of a
therapeutically boosted specific immune response.
Therefore, we investigated if the treatment combination
increased the number of tumor-specific T lymphocytes in
vivo. To accomplish this, subcutaneous CT26 tumors were
induced in BALB/c mice, treated according to protocol
and then T cells were extracted from the spleens to
perform ELISPOT assays. The antigens used in this assay
were AH1 (a tumor antigen highly expressed in the CT26
cell line) and OVA (control peptide). The ELISPOT assay
revealed an increase in CT26-specific T-cells by 3M-011
which was even more augmented by additional radiation
(Supplemental Fig. 4).

cancer that resulted in marked local and systemic antitumor
activity. The rationale of the therapeutic combination was
that radiotherapy would provide tumor antigens, while
the TLR7/8 agonist would stimulate antigen-presenting
cells to process and present these antigens in order to
induce and augment an immune response to the tumor
(Fig. 1). Mechanistically, 3M-011 activation of APC
was essential for NK activation, and both NK and CD8
T cells contributed to antitumor responses to 3M-011 as
a single agent. In combination with irradiation, however,
CD8 effector T cells dominated the antitumor responses.
Nevertheless, DC still had a significant impact on the
antitumor response to 3M-011 plus irradiation, since
their depletion significantly decreased treatment efficacy.
In addition, 3M-011 in combination with irradiation
substantially increased intratumoral INF-γ, which in
turn may contribute to activation of CD8 effector cells.
These mechanisms appear to act in concert to induce a
strong anti-tumor immune reaction, which was markedly
enhanced by the TLR7/8 agonist over the direct effects of
radiation alone.
Tumor cell expression of TLR in carcinomas have
been associated with increased growth and invasiveness
upon TLR activation [17]. However, 3M-011 did not
stimulate the murine or human PDAC and CRC cell
lines in vitro, nor did it enhance tumor growth in any
of the mouse models. There may be several possible
explanations for the differences observed between our
study and that of Ochi et al. One reason for the difference
might be the different TLR agonists used. Ochi et al.
used ssRNA40, E. coli RNA, or Adenine analogs as
TLR agonists, which may activate additional signaling
pathways than just TLR7/8 as compared to the here used
specific TLR7/8 agonist. Another possible explanation
may be tumor microenvironment. Although TLR7
was observed in PDAC tumor cells by Ochi et al., they
reported that the effects of TLR7 activation on the tumor
cells was secondary to TLR7 activation in the surrounding
inflammatory cells (28). Subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 2 A,B)
are likely to have a different microenvironment than a
tumor that develops naturally. Even orthotopic homografts
from established cell lines might have a different
microenvironment, or might respond differently to their
surroundings. Thus, either a different microenvironment
or response to the microenvironment might explain
the apparent discrepancy between our results and those
previously published.
In the subcutaneous tumor models combining 3M011 with radiotherapy, we observed a significant number
of complete remissions despite the relatively low dose of
radiation. These effects were confirmed in the orthotopic
model of pancreatic cancer, where both primary tumor
growth and metastasis were dramatically reduced. In
order to characterize the immune cells responsible for
these beneficial effects, a series of in vitro and in vivo
assays were performed. Using in vitro assays, we were

3M-011 shifts the intratumoral and systemic
cytokine equilibrium to a pro-inflammatory state
To evaluate the effects of the TLR ligand on the
intratumoral cytokine profile, tumor tissue of subcutaneous
tumors were analysed from mice treated with 3M-011 and
ionizing radiation. Changes in the intratumoral cytokine
levels of MCP-1, IL-6, INF-γ and TNF-α were measured
with the BD Cytometric Bead Array.
The intratumoral levels of all four cytokines were
increased by the TLR agonist. For MCP-1, INF-γ and
TNF-α, the increase induced by 3M-011 was statistically
significant (MCP-1, p<0.0001; INF-γ, p=0.0098; TNF-α,
p=0.0024), but the IL-6 increase failed to reach statistical
significance (p=0.1451). When combined with ionizing
radiation, the intratumoral levels of all cytokines except
MCP-1 were further increased (Supplemental Fig. 5A).
Consistent with the increased cytokine levels within
the tumors, treatment induced more pronounced systemic
cytokine responses. Interestingly, for most cytokines,
the systemic increase caused by dual treatment was
smaller than the increase caused by 3M-011 monotherapy
(Supplemental Fig. 5B). Of note, while INF-γ and TNF-α
were not significantly affected by DC depletion, the
systemic levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 were significantly
reduced after DT administration in CD11c.DOG mice
(data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Here we show that the TLR7/8 agonist 3M-011

able to show that NK cells were involved in mediating
the effects of 3M-011, but required co-stimulation by
monocytic cells, which produced significant amounts of
IL-6 upon 3M-011 stimulation. This finding is consistent
with previous reports indicating low TLR7/8 expression in
NK cells and indirect stimulatory effects of TLR agonists
on them [19,25].
By in vivo depletion of NK and/or CD8 T cells we
showed that 3M-011 monotherapy was dependent on both
NK cells and CD8 T cells, both of which contributed
approximately 50% of the antitumor effect. Interestingly,
when combined with ionizing radiation, the role of CD8
T cells became dominant while the role of NK cells
appeared to be negligible. We speculate that this might
be the result of an “intrinsic vaccination” effect, which
may also explain the beneficial interaction of radiation
and TLR stimulation. While the TLR agonist can activate
cells of both the adaptive and innate immune systems, its
main target cells are DC, which phagocytose, process and
present antigens to T cells. Such antigens are released in
abundance by radiation-induced cell death, which explains
the synergistic effects of the dual treatment. Of note, the
tumor sizes in the untreated control groups were not
affected by either NK or CD8 T cell depletion, indicating
effective immune escape mechanisms of the untreated
tumor homografts.
To demonstrate the importance of DC in therapyinduced T cell activation, we used CD11c-DTR transgenic
mice. Depletion of DC eliminated the efficacy of 3M-011
monotherapy and significantly reduced the effects of 3M011 + radiation therapy. The therapy-induced increase of
tumor-specific T cells was also demonstrated in ELISPOT
assays, which was consistent with data from other
groups reporting increased specific immune responses
to antitumor vaccination when combined with a TLR7/8
agonist [26].
Cytokine responses within the tumor were more
subtle than those observed in plasma, but only within
the tumor could induction of cytokines be observed in
response to irradiation monotherapy. In contrast, only 3M011 induced cytokine elevations in plasma. The dramatic
cytokine response (“cytokine storm”) caused by systemic
3M-011 administration was well tolerated by the animals,
but such responses in humans might cause side effects
such as flu-like symptoms. Depending on the severity of
these side effects, systemic induction of cytokines could
result in a dose-limiting toxicity that might require dose
reductions or discontinuation of therapy [27]. These
considerations suggest that a locally applied TLR7/8
agonist might be preferable.
Imiquimod (Aldara cream) is a topically
administered TLR agonist, and the only one that has
been clinically approved to date. Imiquimod shows
significant activity in many skin conditions including
basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis (a precancerous
form of squamous cell carcinoma [28]) and, off label,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

melanoma [29]. While topical TLR agonists and radiation
combinations have shown promise [30], gastrointestinal
tumors are not accessible to topical treatment and
require other ways of administration. For the treatment
of CRC and PDAC, intratumoral administration (e.g.,
endoscopically or interventionally) could be a feasible
way of administration. Such topical administration would
be expected to activate the immune cells in contact
with tumor antigens while avoiding excessive systemic
cytokine release. In patients with metastatic cancer, an
interesting question will be whether local treatment of a
single metastatic lesion can induce a systemic immune
response. For example, distant metastases in the liver or
the skin may be easily accessible to local or even topical
treatment. The induction of a systemic immune reaction by
treating a single, easily accessible lesion would potentially
greatly benefit patients with a yet dismal prognosis and has
anecdotally been reported in other tumor entities before
[31].
Two recent studies recently published that used a
similar approach of combining radiation and another
TLR7/8 agonist in a lymphoma [32] and another GI and a
fibrosarcoma tumor model [33] are in general agreement
with our data, thus independently confirming the
combination benefits and supporting the high translational
relevance of this therapeutic strategy for a wide range of
tumors. Besides demonstrating that this approach may be
applicable to additional types of tumors, our data provide
conclusive evidence that it is CD11c+ DC that mediate the
therapeutic effects via NK and CD8 T cell activation and
priming.
In summary, the data presented here clearly show
a marked antitumoral activity of 3M-011 combined with
ionizing radiation. The effects are mediated by NK and,
predominantly, cytotoxic T cells that require activation by
DC, which are the main target of the TLR7/8 agonists.
These observations suggest that further investigation is
warranted.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines
The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines
Panc-1 and BxPC3, the human colorectal carcinoma
cell lines HT29 and HCT-116, and the murine colorectal
carcinoma cell line CT26 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in 2008.
The murine pancreatic carcinoma cell line Panc-02 was
generously provided by P. Carmeliet (VIB Vesalius
research Center, Leuven, Belgium) in 2010. Panc-1,
BxPC3, HT29 and Panc-02 were propagated in RPMI
(PAA)) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL

streptomycin. HCT-116 and CT26 were propagated in
DMEM (PAA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/
mL streptomycin. All cell lines were regularly tested for
contamination and authenticated by the DKFZ Genome
and Proteome Core Facility via SNP profiling. The last
authentication was done in 2012, shortly before the
experiments with cell lines were completed.

Irradiation was delivered in 2 Gray fractions on
5 subsequent days on a Siemens Gammatron unless
indicated otherwise. Tumor-surrounding tissue was
covered using lead shields.

3M-011 treatment

Proliferation and apoptosis assays

3M-011 was dissolved in 0,1 M sodium acetate
buffer at pH=5.2 and mice were injected i.p. with 200 µl
of 3M-011 at dose of 5mg/kg body weight every other
day until termination of the experiment. Control group
mice received 200 µl of sodium acetate buffer in the same
volume and regimen.
For subcutaneous tumors, treatment was initiated
when the tumors reached an average diameter of 6 mm. In
the orthotopic mouse model treatment was initiated on day
2 after tumor cell inoculation.

Cell lines were cultured in a final volume of 100 μl/
well culture medium in 96 well flat bottom cell culture
microplates and incubated overnight. Different starting
cell concentrations were assessed. (0/well, 250/well, 500/
well, 1000/well). Cells were then treated with 0.1, 1.0 and
10 μM 3M-011 or sodium acetate buffer as a control for
96 hours. Then 100 μl/well WST-1 reagent was added.
Cells were incubated in a 37 °C incubator maintained at
5% CO2 for 3 hours, then were shaken thoroughly for 1
min. Absorbance of the samples was measured using a
microplate reader at 480 nm. All experiments were done
in quadruplicates.

Positron emission tomography (PET)
The animals were fasted for 4 h prior to PET
and kept in an inhalation narcosis with sevorane (0.5
volume-%) and oxygen (flow = 500 ml/min) during the
PET examination. The plasma glucose level of the animals
was determined using a blood glucose sensor electrode
(MediSense) with glucose levels between 100 and 135
mg/dl. A transmission scan was done for 10 minutes prior
to tracer administration with two rotating germanium
pin sources to obtain cross sections for attenuation
correction. The injected activity was 8-9.9 MBq and
adjusted according to the weight of the animal which
ranged from 14 g to 25 g. PET data were acquired for 20
minutes at 40 to 60 minutes p.i. on an Siemens Inveon
scanner (Siemens) using a matrix of 256 x 256 (pixel
size 0.3882 x 0.3882 x 0.796 mm). Thereafter, images
were reconstructed iteratively using the space alternating
generalized expectation maximization method (SAGE, 16
subsets, 4 iterations) applying median root prior correction
and were converted to standardized uptake value (SUV)
images on the basis of the formula

Mouse models
BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories. CD11c.DOG mice were
kindly provided by Dr. Günter Hämmerling, DKFZ,
Germany. All mice were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions with a 12hr light/dark cycle
and had ad libitum access to standard laboratory diet
and water. All animal experiments were evaluated and
permitted by both institutional and governmental animal
welfare committees (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe)
and performed in strict accordance to FELASA and GVSOLAS guidelines.
Subcutaneous tumor models: 1x 105 tumor cells
(CT26 or Panc-02) were injected s.c. into syngeneic
animals (BALB/c or C57Bl/6). Once the resulting tumors
reached a size of 10-12 mm in largest diameter, the tumors
were excised and 1x1 mm fragments were implanted
subcutaneously into the right flank of BALB/c or C57Bl/6
animals. Tumor volumes were subsequently measured
every other day with a caliper, the formula:

In vivo depletion of NK cells, cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells

, where d is the minor tumor axis and D
is the major tumor axis, was used to estimate the tumor
volume. Mice were euthanized when tumors reached 20
mm in largest diameter or suffering of the animals became
apparent.
Orthotopic PDAC model: 1x 106 Panc02 tumor cells
were surgically injected into the head of the pancreas.
Mice were euthanized after 11 days or when suffering of
the animals became apparent.

Depletion of NK cells was performed by i.p.
injection of 300 μg anti-NK1.1 mAb PK136 (BioXCell)
/ mouse as described before [22]. Antibody treatment
was done 2 d prior to tumor cell inoculation and on days
0,5, and 10 of the experiment (with 0 being the day of
tumor cell inoculation). For depletion of cytotoxic T

cells, mice were injected i.p. with 200 μg anti-CD8 mAb
53.6-72 (BioXCell) 2 days and 1 day before infection and
subsequently on days 0, 4, and 8 as described before [23].
Effectiveness of depletion confirmed in blood on days
0, 4, and 8 by flow cytometry. >98% depletion of CD8
T cells and >95% depletion of NK cells were achieved,
respectively. All other groups were treated with the
according isotype control antibodies (BioXCell, Fig. 4).
For depletion of DC, CD11c.DOG mice were treated
with 8 ng/g body weight of diphtheria toxin (DT) i.p. on
day −2, 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 (with 0 being the day of tumor
cell inoculation). CD11c+ cell depletion efficacy was
assessed using flow cytometry on days 0, 4, and 8.

Serum: At day 7 after initiation of the treatment,
blood was withdrawn from tumor-bearing mice by
puncture of the retrobulbar venous plexus, supplemented
with Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche) and allowed to
clot on ice for 30 minutes. The blood was then centrifuged
and the serum supernatant obtained.
Tumor tissue lysates: To obtain tumor lysates,
tumors were macrodissected and 50 µg of tumor tissue
were lysed in 1 ml M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction
Reagent (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with Complete
Protease Inhibitor (Roche) in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was obtained and used for
cytokine quantification.
ELISA: The following ELISA kits where used
accordingly to manufacturers’ protocols: LEGEND MAX
Human INF-γ ELISA Kit, LEGEND MAX Human IL-6
ELISA Kit, LEGEND MAX Human IL-12 (p70) ELISA
Kit, LEGEND MAXHuman IL-15 ELISA Kit, LEGEND
MAXHuman MCP-1/CCL2 ELISA Kit, LEGEND MAX
Human TNF-α ELISA Kit (all from R&D) and Human
INF-α ELISA Kit, Human IL-18/IL-1F4 ELISA (all from
Biolegend).
BD Cytometric Bead Arrays: Proinflammatory
murine cytokines (INF-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL10 IL-12p70) were quantified simultaneously using
the Mouse Inflammation Cytokine Cytometric Bead
Array Kit and CBA software (BD Pharmingen). The kit
was used according to manufacturer’s instructions on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) on mouse sera and tumor lysates. To obtain tumor
lysates, tumors were macrodissected and 50 µg of tumor
tissue were lysed in 1 ml M-PER Mammalian Protein
Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) supplemented
with Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche) in a TissueLyser
II (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

Natural killer cell cytotoxicity assay (NKCC)
The bioassay for NKCC was performed using whole
blood within 8 hours of collection in a chromium release
assay as previously described [34]. The human colorectal
carcinoma cell line HT29 was used as target. NK cells
were incubated for 16h with indicated concentrations of
3M-011 or cell supernatant prior to NKCC assay. The
assay was done in triplicates with 4 hours of incubation
time and the relative cytotoxic activity was calculated as
follows:

Cell Isolation and Sorting
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
isolated from freshly obtained blood from healthy donors
by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare,
USA) as described previously [35].
Cell sorting was performed on a FACS Aria II
sorting system (BD Biosciences) using MEM-188-APC
for CD56, 3G8-Cy5.5 for CD16, and hCD14-FITC for
CD14 (all from Biolegend).

Flow cytometry

ELISPOT

Samples were analyzed on a standard BD FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Samples were
stained according to the manufacturer’s protocols for
staining of surface antigens in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% fetal
calf serum). Samples were analyzed as indicated using the
following antibodies: 3G8-Cy5.5 for CD16, MEM-188APC for CD56, hCD14-FITC for CD14, OKT3-FITC for
CD3, PK136-Alexa Fluor 488 for NK1.1, 53-6.7-Alexa
Fluor 647 for CD8a (all from Biolegend). Samples were
acquired for 3 to 4-colour analysis and analyzed using
FlowJo 7.5 software (TreeStar Inc). A total of 500,000–
1,200,000 cells were acquired.

To determine systemic tumor-reactive T cell
immunity, we isolated T cells from peripheral blood
and bone marrow of CT26-bearing BALB/C mice
treated with 3M-011 or control. DC were derived from
non-tumor-bearing BALB/C mice. We used defined
synthetic polypeptides of the tumor-associated tumor
antigen AH1 to pulse the DC as described previously
[36]. Spot-forming cells were quantified using the KS
ELISPOT reader (Zeiss) and CTL ImmunoSpot Analyzer
and ImmunoSpot software (Cellular Technology). Spots
were measured in the presence of DC pulsed with AH-1
(endogenous tumor antigen on CT-26 tumor cells). Spots
