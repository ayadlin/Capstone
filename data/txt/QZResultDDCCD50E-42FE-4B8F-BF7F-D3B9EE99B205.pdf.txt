Abstract
p53 is regulated at multiple levels. We report here that
p53, in multiple lines of human cancer cells, is down-regulated
by cardiac glycoside drugs digoxin and ouabain, potent
inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase. These drugs reduced the basal
levels of p53 protein at nanomolar concentrations in a dose-,
time-, and cancer cell line–dependent manner, but independent of p53 status of wild-type or mutant. The drugs also
reduced the levels of p53 induced by its activators as well as
p53 transfected into human cancer cells, regardless of its
status. Interestingly, the drugs had no effect on endogenous
p53 in two immortalized human cell lines. Mechanistically,
p53 reduction occurred not at the mRNA levels but at the
protein levels, as a result of reduced protein synthesis rather
than enhanced degradation. The cellular sensitivity to druginduced p53 reduction was not associated with the levels of
A subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase in different cell lines. Although
lowering extracellular K+ did not reduce p53 as did ouabain
and digoxin, it did potentiate both digoxin- and ouabaininduced p53 reduction in sensitive lines. Finally, p53 reduction
seems to be triggered by activation of Src/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways upon drug binding
to the Na+/K+-ATPase and can be completely blocked by the
inhibitors of Src or MAP/ERK kinase. This is the first report
that cardiac glycoside drugs, by initiating the Src/MAPK
signaling pathways, reduce the p53 levels via inhibition of p53
protein synthesis. The drugs may be useful in the treatment of
human cancers with a gain-of-function p53 mutation. [Cancer

Introduction
p53 prevents tumor formation through transcription-dependent
and transcription-independent mechanisms. Transcriptiondependent mechanism is mainly mediated by p53 up-regulation
of its downstream targets. Upon activation by a variety of stimuli,

p53 induces the expression of proarrest genes, such as p21,
Gadd45, or 14-3-3j to induce growth arrest or of proapoptotic
genes, such as PUMA, PIG-3, or DR5 to induce apoptosis (1).
Through a direct binding to mitochondria and modulating BH3
family proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax, p53 can also regulate
apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner (2, 3). Thus, p53
acts as a guardian of the genome by inducing growth arrest to allow
cells to repair the damage or apoptosis, if the damage is too severe and
irreparable.
Because p53 plays a pivotal role in controlling abnormal cell
growth and is inactivated by point mutations in >50% human
cancers, p53 has been a central target for mechanism-driven
cancer drug discovery (4, 5). Significant progress has been made
in past decade, leading to identification and characterization of
several unique classes of small molecules that modulate p53
(6, 7). They can be categorized as follows: (a) the molecules that
restore wild-type (wt) p53 from a mutant conformation, which
include CP-31398 (8), PRIMA-1 (9), and ellipticine (10); (b) the
molecules that target Mdm2 to reactivate p53, including Mdm2
E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitor, HLI98 (11), and inhibitors that
disrupt Mdm2-p53 binding, such as Nutlin (12), RITA (13), and
MI-219 and its analogues (14–16); (c) the molecules that inhibits
wt p53, including pifithrin-a (17), and pifithrin-mu (18); and (d)
the molecules that selectively degrade mutant p53, including
Hsp90-active agents such as geldanamycin (19) and histone
deacetylase inhibitors, such as trichostatin (20).
During the screening for small molecules that selectively kill
mutant-p53 containing cancer cells via a synthetic lethal mechanism
(21), we serendipitously found that cardiac glycoside drugs, digoxin
and ouabain, reduced the p53 levels in a time- and dose-dependent
manner in sensitive cancer cell lines. The drug sensitivity to p53
reduction is cancer cell line–dependent, but independent of p53
status of a wt or mutants. Importantly, the drugs are completely
inactive in reducing wt p53 in normal ‘‘immortalized’’ cells. Mechanistically, the drug-induced p53 decrease occurred not at the mRNA
levels, but at the protein levels, as a result of reduced synthesis,
rather than enhanced degradation. The drug-induced p53 reduction
can be rescued by the inhibitors of Src and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK),
suggesting an involvement of Src/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathways, initiated upon the drug binding to Na+/
K+-ATPase. Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which
activation of Src/MAPK kinase pathway could eventually lead to
p53 elimination by inhibiting p53 protein synthesis.

p53 Reduction by Digoxin and Ouabain

Figure 1. Cardiac glycosides digoxin (DG ) and ouabain (OU ) reduce basal p53 levels in lung cancer cell lines: dose and time dependent. A, structure of
digoxin and ouabain. B, digoxin or ouabain reduces p53 levels: A549 and H1355 lung cancer cells were treated with digoxin or ouabain at 100 nmol/L for 24 h
and subjected to Western blotting. C, dose-dependent reduction of p53 levels by digoxin: Four lung cancer lines were treated with digoxin at 30 or 100 nmol/L for

at 100 nmol/L for indicated periods of time, followed by Western blotting.

RPMI 1640 and McCoy’s 5A medium, respectively, containing 10% serum.
NL20 cells were cultured in Ham’s F12 medium as described (22). For drug
treatment, subconfluent cells were treated with digoxin or ouabain alone or
in combination of PP2, PD098059, or LY294002 (Sigma).
For culturing cells in low K+ conditions, A549 or H1355 cells were
cultured in 10% DMEM until the cell densities reached 80%. The medium
was replaced by K+-free DMEM supplemented with normal K+ concentration (5 mmol/L) or low K+ concentrations (1 or 0.3 mmol/L). Na+ was added
to the low K+ medium to maintain the equal ion concentrations (23).
Western blotting analysis. The assay was done as described previously
(16). The antibodies used are p53 (Calbiochem; 1:1,000); p21 (BD; 1:1,000);
Mdm2 (Calbiochem; 1:500); FAK, Src, or tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
1:1,000); pSrc at Y418 (Invitrogen; 1:1,000); pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 1:1,000);
Na+/K+-ATPase a1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the
University of Iowa; 1:500); Na+/K+-ATPase a3 (Affinity BioReagents; 1:1,000);
and h-actin (Sigma; 1:5,000).
Transfection and infection. H1299 cells were plated into six-well plate
at 2  105 cells per well and transfected the following day with 1 Ag of
plasmid expressing either p53-wt or p53-mutants for 24 h before drug treatment. For the infection of sh-RNA targeting FAK viruses (gift from Jun-Lin
Guan, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), a total of 109 plaque-forming
unit viruses were infected into 2  106 A549 or H1355 cells per 100-mm dish
for 72 h. Cells were split, followed by exposure to drugs next day for 24 h. To
silence endogenous wt p53, A549 or H460 cells were infected with a lentivirusbased siRNA construct, LT-p53-siRNA, as described (16).

ATPlite growth assay and IC50 determination. Cells were seeded in
96-well white plates and treated with the drugs with a range of indicated
concentrations for 24 h. The viability of the cells was then measured using a
one-step ATPlite kit (Perkin-Elmer). The results were calculated and plotted
in Prism 4.0 (Graphpad) to generate IC50 curves (22).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from
cells after drug treatment, using a Trizol kit (Invitrogen), and subjected to
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, using QuantiTect
SYBR green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 50 AL reaction mixture were used
for each reaction, which contained 2 QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR
Master Mix, 0.5 AL QuantiTect RT mix, 0.5 Amol/L primer mix, and 0.5 Ag
RNA. Cycling program was set as the following: 50jC 30 min for RT, 95jC
15 min for the PCR initial activation and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94jC
for 15 s, annealing at 55jC for 30 s, and extension at 72jC for 30 s. The
sequences of p53 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
are as follows: hu-p53 F1:TCTGTGACTTGCACGTAC; hu-p53 R1: ATTTCCTTCCACTCGGAT. GAPDH-F1: GTTGCCATCAATGACCCCTT; GAPDH-R1:

S-Met metabolic labeling. Subconfluent cells were treated with the
drugs for various time points with last hour in methionine and cysteine-free
DMEM, containing 5% dialyzed FCS and 50 Amol/L MG132. Cells were then
labeled with 100 ACi/mL of [35S]-methionine (MP Biochemicals) for 5 min,
followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 antibody (Santa Cruz).

Immunoprecipitates, along with whole cell extract, were then subjected to
SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The steady-state levels of p53 were
measured by immunoprecipitated, followed by Western blotting, along with
the detection of total cellular proteins by Coomassie staining.

Results
Cardiac glycosides reduced basal levels of p53 in lung
cancer cell lines. During our confirmation of candidates identified
from a chemical library screen for selective killing of cancer
cells with mutant p53 via synthetic lethal mechanism (21), we
serendipitously found that cardiac glycosides, including digoxin
and ouabain (Fig. 1A for structure), are able to reduce the p53
levels. As shown in Fig. 1B, digoxin or ouabain at the nanomolar
concentrations reduced or eliminated the basal levels of p53 in two
lung cancer lines, A549 with a wt p53 and H1355 with a mutant
p53, with ouabain being more potent. Digoxin-induced p53
reduction or elimination was the dose-dependent, but the p53
status independent in four lung cancer cell lines with either wt
or mutant p53 status (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, p53 reduction is
treatment-time dependent, starting to occur at 8 hours with a
complete elimination seen by ouabain at 16 hours after drug
exposure (Fig. 1D). Finally, cell line–dependent, but p53 status–
independent, p53 reduction or elimination by digoxin or ouabain
can be extended to multiple human cancer cell lines. These include
colon cancer lines, DLD1, but not HCT116, nor HT29; breast cancer
lines, MCF7, but not MDA-MB231; all three head and neck
squamous carcinoma lines, but not three glioblastoma lines tested
(Supplementary Materials; Supplementary Fig. S1). Digoxigenin,
another cardiac glycoside was also active, but 10-fold less potent in
reducing p53 levels in multiple human cancer lines (data not

shown). Our results clearly showed that p53 levels in multiple
human cancer cell lines are subjected to reduction or elimination
by cardiac glycosides, digoxin or ouabain, in a cell line–dependent,
but p53 status–independent manner.
Cardiac glycosides blocked p53 induction and p53 upregulation of its target genes by p53 activators. We next
determined if digoxin or ouabain also reduced the levels of induced
p53 and p53 transactivation of its target genes by known p53
activators. Three lung cancer cell lines were treated for 24 hours
with MI-219, an Mdm2 inhibitor, which activates p53 by disrupting
Mdm2-p53 binding (14) or etoposide, a DNA damaging agent,
known to activate p53 in wt p53-containing lung cancer cells (16),
alone or in combination with digoxin or ouabain, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 2A, MI-219 or etoposide treatment induced p53 levels
as well as p53 target proteins, p21 or Mdm2 (by MI-219 only), in
two wt p53-containing lines, A549 and H460, but not in mutant
p53-containing line, H1355 (lanes 1–3). Combinational treatment
with either digoxin or ouabain reduced the induced levels of p53
and completely eliminated p53 induction of its targets, p21 and
Mdm2 in A549 and H460 cells (lanes 4–9). The mutant p53 in
H1355 was not subjected to induction by two p53 activators, but
was completely eliminated in combinational treatment (bottom).
p53 can be stabilized by hypoxia in wt p53 containing MCF7 cells
by chemical hypoxic agents, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), and desferrioxamine (24). We next determined if hypoxia-stabilized p53 is also
subjected to reduction by digoxin or ouabain. As shown in Fig. 2B,
a 24-hour treatment of CoCl2 stabilized p53 up to 2-fold in MCF7
cells. This stabilized p53 was reduced and eliminated by
simultaneous treatment of digoxin or ouabain in a dose-dependent
manner up to 300 nmol/L (lanes 3–8). Along with p53 reduction,
two p53 target proteins, p21 and Mdm2, which were detectable at

with CoCl2 (0.5 mmol/L) alone or in

p53 Reduction by Digoxin and Ouabain

Figure 3. Digoxin or ouabain selectively reduces the p53 levels in cancer cells, but not in immortalized normal cells. A, p53 status-independent reduction of stably
overexpressed p53: A stable clone of H1299 lung cancer cells (endogenous p53-null), overexpressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant (H1299-p53ts-A138V),
was treated with various concentrations of digoxin as indicated while grown at 37jC (adapting a mutant p53 conformation) or 32jC (adapting a wt p53 conformation).
The levels of p53 and its two target proteins, p21 and Mdm2, were measured by Western blotting. B, p53 status-independent reduction of transiently overexpressed
p53: p53-null H1299 cells were transiently transfected with wt p53 or two p53 mutants most frequently found in human cancer (p53-R248W and p53-R273H).
Cells were subsequently treated with the drugs for 24 h, followed by Western blotting. C, lack of p53 reduction by digoxin or ouabain in two immortalized lung-derived
cells: Lung fibroblast MRC5 and bronchial epithelial NL20 cells were treated with digoxin or ouabain for 24 h, followed by Western blotting.

the basal levels due to a relatively higher level of p53, were also
reduced and eliminated. Taken together, these results indicate
that both cardiac glycosides also reduced the levels of p53 and its
target proteins upon p53 activation and stabilization. The results
further suggest that drug-induced p53 reduction may be Mdm2
independent because Mdm2 is free from p53 binding upon MI219 treatment (14).
Cardiac glycosides reduced the levels of transfected p53 in
cancer cells, but had no effect on endogenous wt p53 in
normal cells. We next determined if p53 upon overexpression in
a p53-null H1299 cells would also subjected to digoxin or ouabain
reduction. H1299 cells overexpressing a temperature sensitive
p53 mutant (codon 138; ref. 25) were treated with digoxin for
24 hours at 37jC (p53 adopts a mutant conformation) or 32jC
(wt conformation). As shown in Fig. 3A, digoxin treatment caused a
dose-dependent reduction of overexpressed p53, regardless of p53
status. Upon p53 reduction, p53 target genes, p21 and Mdm2,
induced at 32jC when p53 is in a wt status, were also reduced
accordingly. Likewise, digoxin reduced the levels of p53 transiently
transfected into H1299 cells regardless of the p53 status of wt or
two mutants, R248W and R273H, most frequently found in human
cancer (Fig. 3B). However, the potency of drugs against overexpressed p53 was much reduced with much high drug doses up to
10 Amol/L to achieve a moderate effect. Interestingly, digoxin or
ouabain failed to reduce the endogenous wt p53 highly expressed in
two immortalized lung-derived cell lines, MRC5 lung fibroblast and
NL20 bronchial epithelia (Fig. 3C). These results indicated a tumor

cell line selective and p53 status–independent reduction of p53 by
digoxin or ouabain.
Dissociation between drug cytotoxicity and drug-induced
p53 reduction. To exclude the possibility that p53 reduction is the
consequence of drug-induced cytotoxicity, we measured the IC50
values of a panel of cancer cell lines, either sensitive or resistant to
drug-induced p53 reduction. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2,
digoxin or ouabain was quite potent growth inhibitor with an IC50
ranging from 50 to 100 nmol/L in the majority of lines tested.
However, the drug cytotoxicity seems not to be associated with
cellular sensitivity to drug-induced p53 reduction. For examples,
two sensitive lines, H1355 and DLD1, had similar IC50 values to
two resistant lines, HCT116 and HT29, whereas MCF7 cells are
rather resistant to digoxin cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. S2A),
but sensitive to digoxin-induced p53 reduction (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The morphologic appearances of A549 and H1355 after drug
treatment for different periods of time were shown in Supplementary
Fig. S3, which showed a moderate cytotoxicity only at 24 hours,
particularly in H1355 cells. Furthermore, because two wt p53containing lines, A549 and H460 seemed to be the most sensitivity to
drug cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 20 to 40 nmol/L, we determined if the
cytotoxicity is p53 dependent. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B to
D, siRNA silencing of p53 did not change drug cytotoxicity, indicating
that cytotoxicity is not mediated through, nor associated with wt p53.
Cardiac glycosides–induced p53 reduction does not occur at
the mRNA levels, but at the protein levels. p53 regulation by
digoxin or ouabain could occur at the levels of transcription,

p53 Reduction by Digoxin and Ouabain

Figure 5. Effect of Na+/K+-ATPase on p53
reduction by digoxin or ouabain. A, the
levels of a subunits of the pump did not
correlate with cellular sensitivity to p53
reduction: Two sensitive and two resistant
colon and breast cancer cell lines were
treated with ouabain and the levels of
a1 and a3 subunits were measured
with Western blotting. B, lowering the
pump activity enhanced p53 reduction:
Cells were cultured in regular medium
containing 5 mmol/L potassium or special
media with potassium concentration reduced to 1 or 0.3 mmol/L. Cells were left
untreated or treated with digoxin or ouabain
for 24 h, followed by Western blotting. Note
that two bands (p53 and p47) were
visualized in A549 cells after prolonged
electrophoresis, but both are subjected to
reduction
by drugs.

translation, or posttranslation, although posttranslational regulation is the most common mechanism for p53 regulation. We
first examined if p53 reduction occurred at the mRNA levels. Five
cell lines with four sensitive (A549, H460, DLD-1, and H1355) and
one resistant (HT29) were treated with digoxin at various doses
up to 1 Amol/L and subjected to RT-qPCR analysis. As shown in
Fig. 4A, the mRNA levels were rather consistent with all treatments
among all tested lines, regardless of their drug sensitivity or p53
status. Thus, p53 reduction does not occur at the mRNA levels.
We next determined if digoxin or ouabain-induced p53 reduction
was due to enhanced degradation. Three sensitive lung cancer lines
were treated with digoxin or ouabain, alone or in combination with
proteasome inhibitor, MG132 in last 6 hours before cell harvesting.
As shown in Fig. 4B, MG132 treatment only slightly, if any, blocked
digoxin- or ouabain-induced reduction of p53 levels in A549 and
H460 cells (lanes 3 versus 2; 5 versus 4; and 13 versus 12; 15 versus
14), but had no effect on H1355 cells (lanes 7–10). Similar results
were obtained when PS341, a potent proteasome inhibitor, was
used (data not shown). A minor blockade of p53 reduction by
MG132 was also observed in sensitive DLD-1 and MCF-7 cells (data
not shown).
We then measured the effect of digoxin or ouabain on p53
protein half-life using A549 or H1355 cells. Cells were treated with
cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis in the absence or
presence of digoxin or ouabain and harvested at various time
points for p53 level measurement by Western blotting. As shown
in Fig. 4C, wt p53 has a protein half-life of f0.5 to 1 hour in

A549 cells (top), whereas mutant p53 has a half-life of 2 to
4 hours in H1355 cells (bottom). In both cases, however, digoxin
or ouabain treatment did not change the p53 half-life. As
expected, p53 degradation can be blocked by MG132, independent
of drug treatment (lanes 6 and 11 versus 5 and 10; lanes 7 and
13 versus 6 and 12). Taken together, these results indicate that
digoxin or ouabain-induced p53 reduction is not due to enhanced
degradation.
We finally determined if digoxin or ouabain could inhibit p53
protein synthesis. Two drug sensitive lines A549 and H1355 were
used and newly synthesized p53 was measured by 35S-methionine
labeling in the presence of MG132 to block p53 degradation. As
shown in Fig. 4D, in both lines digoxin or ouabain treatment
induced a time-dependent inhibition of de novo p53 protein
synthesis with a complete elimination of p53 synthesis at 2.5 or
3 hours after treatment, respectively (top). The drugs also caused a
time-dependent inhibition of overall de novo protein synthesis but
to less extent (second panel with quantification data shown on the
right). In contrast, the same treatment did not change the steadystate levels of p53 (third panel), nor the total cellular proteins
(bottom). The drug also inhibited de novo synthesis of p53 in an
additional sensitive line, MCF7 (data not shown). Thus, digoxin or
ouabain-induced p53 reduction is not due to enhanced degradation, rather due to inhibited protein synthesis.
Cardiac glycosides–induced p53 reduction is independent of
the levels of A subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase, but is enhanced by
lowering extracellular K+. The cardiac glycosides target for

treatment: Five cancer cell lines were treated with digoxin for 24 h, followed by RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis. The relative p53 mRNA levels were plotted.
B, proteasome inhibitor failed to rescue p53 reduction: Cells were treated with digoxin or ouabain for 24 h, alone or in combination with MG132 (added in last 6 h),
followed by Western blotting. C, digoxin or ouabain did not shorten p53 protein half-life: Cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX ) to block new protein synthesis
in the absence or presence of digoxin (100 nmol/L) or ouabain (30 nmol/L). Cells were harvested at various time points and subjected to Western blot analysis.
D, digoxin or ouabain inhibited de novo p53 synthesis: Cells were treated with digoxin or ouabain for indicated periods of time with MG132 addition at the last hour.
Cells were pulse labeled with 35S-methionine for 5 min, followed by p53 immunoprecipitation (IP ) and autoradiography (top ). Total 35S-methionine incorporation
into cellular proteins was assessed by autoradiography (second panel ). The steady-state levels of p53 was measured by p53 immunoprecipitation, followed by Western
blotting (third panel ), whereas the total amounts of cellular proteins were measured by Coomassie blue staining (bottom ). WCE , whole cell extracts.

treatment of congestive heart failure is the Na+/K+-ATPase (26). We
determine if the levels of Na+/K+-ATPase a subunits are associated
with cellular sensitivity to ouabain-induced p53 reduction. As
depicted in Fig. 5A, Western blot analyses reveal that both ouabainsensitive and ouabain-resistant cells express a1 and a3. Apparently,
the cellular sensitivity of ouabain-induced p53 reduction did not
correlate with the basal levels of Na+/K+-ATPase in these cells. To
test if inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by means other than cardiac
glycosides is sufficient to reduce p53, we lowered extracellular K+
from 5 mmol/L to 1 and 0.3 mmol/L (27), and measured for p53. As
shown in Fig. 5B, reduction of potassium concentration had no
effect on the basal levels of p53 (lanes 1–3). Interestingly, digoxinor ouabain-induced p53 reduction was more pronounced progressively, consistent with the fact that lowering extracellular K+
increases digoxin- and ouabain-binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase.
These results clearly showed that digoxin- or ouabain-induced
p53 reduction is promoted by the binding of these drugs to the
Na+/K+-ATPase.
Cardiac glycosides reduced p53 levels via triggering and
activating Src/MAPK signaling pathways. It has been proposed

that the Na+/K+-ATPase is preassembled with its partners in
caveolae; the binding of ouabain or digoxin to the pump activates
the signalosome to transduce the signals via multiple pathways,
including Src, FAK, MAPK, and PI-3K (28–30). We first determined
if digoxin or ouabain treatment would activate Src or MAPK in
sensitive A549 and H1355 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, a short
treatment of cells with digoxin or ouabain for 5 or 15 minutes
caused Src and MAPK activation, as shown by increased
phosphorylation at the activation sites (pSrc-Y418 and pERKsT183/Y185). We then determined the effect of Src and FAK
inhibition on drug-induced p53 reduction because Src and FAK are
two upstream molecules activated upon ouabain- or digoxin-pump
binding (29). In both A549 and H1355 cells, a potent Src tyrosine
kinase inhibitor PP2 (31) blocked the p53 reduction by digoxin or
ouabain in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B, lanes 3–5 versus 1;
7–9 versus 6 and 12–15 versus 10; 17 versus 16, respectively),
whereas the inhibitor itself had no effect on the p53 level (lane 15;
data not shown). On the other hand, siRNA silencing of FAK in
either A549 or H1355 cells had no effect on p53 reduction by
digoxin or ouabain (Supplementary Fig. S4). We, therefore, focused

Figure 6. p53 reduction by ouabain or digoxin was mediated by Src/MAPK/PI3K signaling pathways. A, activation of Src and MAPK upon ouabain/digoxin exposure.
Cells were serum starved for 36 h, followed by exposed to ouabain (30 nmol/L) or digoxin (100 nmol/L) for indicated periods of time, and analyzed by Western
blotting. pSrc/pERK , phosporylated form of Src/ERK; tSrc /tERK , total Src/ERK. B, p53 reduction rescued by Src inhibitor PP2. Cells were left untreated or treated with
digoxin or ouabain alone or in combination with increasing concentrations of PP2 for 24 h. C, p53 reduction rescued by MAPK or PI3K inhibitor. Cells were left untreated
or treated with digoxin alone or in combination with MEK inhibitor PD098059 or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting.

p53 Reduction by Digoxin and Ouabain

our attention on Src downstream pathways, particularly MAPK
and PI3K pathways using specific inhibitors to determine if they
blocked p53 reduction. Indeed, whereas PD098059, a MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK pathway or LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor
had no effect on the levels of p53 by drug itself (Fig. 6C, lanes 2
and 3 versus 1 and lanes 8 versus 7 and 14 versus 13), both inhibitors were able to rescue the p53 reduction by digoxin in
A549 cells (Fig. 6C, lanes 5 and 6 versus 4). Only MEK inhibitor
but not PI3K inhibitor, partially rescued p53 reduction in H1355
cells (Fig. 6C, lanes 10–12 versus 9 and 16 versus 15). Taken
together, these results showed that activation of SRC/MAPK/
PI3K signaling pathways triggered by the binding of cardiac glycosides to the pump is responsible for p53 reduction. Although
the SRC activation mediates p53 reduction in both cell lines,
MAPK and PI3K are involved in A549 cells, whereas MAPK, but
not PI3K, is partially involved in H1355 cells.

Discussion
Cardiac glycosides are a class of natural products that have
been used for medical purposes since ancient time. Three wellknown cardiac glycosides, digoxin, ouabain, and digitoxin were
used for the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial
fibrillation via binding and inhibiting Na+/K+-ATPase to increase
intracellular calcium concentrations (28). In addition to benefit
heart failure patients, the drugs were also found to be beneficial
to breast cancer patients (32), and were associated with a lower
risk for leukemia, lymphoma, as well as kidney and urinary tract
cancer (33). Accumulated data in past few years have shown that
cardiac glycosides selectively inhibited proliferation and induced
apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells, but not normal cells,
suggesting their utility in anticancer therapy (ref. 34, and for
review, see ref. 28). Mechanistically, digoxin or ouabain inhibited
catalytic activity of topoisomerase II (35) and stabilized DNAtopoisomerase II complexes to suppress growth. Digoxin, ouabain,
or other cardiac glycosides up-regulated death receptor 4 and
5 to sensitize lung cancer cells to apoptosis induced by Apo2L/
TRAIL (36). Digoxin or ouabain also remarkably inhibit protein
synthesis of HIF-1a to block HIF1 transcription factor activity
and to inhibit tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo (37).
Furthermore, digoxin or ouabain could modulate signaling
pathways of MAPK/AKT, PKC/ activator protein, nuclear factornB, and reactive oxygen species to regulate cell growth and
survival ( for reviews, see refs. 26, 28). Finally, globe level
reduction of protein synthesis upon drug exposure, as shown
in our study (Fig. 4D ), could also contribute to their
cytotoxicity. However, the role of p53 in the action of cardiac
glycosides is totally unknown, although a recent study showed
an observation that ouabain slightly reduced p53 level in a
breast cancer line, MDA-MB-435s, without providing any
mechanistic insight (38).
Digoxin was identified in our chemical library screening for the
drugs that selectively kill cancer cells with mutant p53 via
synthetic lethal mechanism (21). Subsequent analysis serendipitously found that the drug effectively reduces p53 levels in a cell
line–dependent, but p53 status–independent manner. It is wellknown that p53 is a short-lived protein whose expression was
regulated mainly at the posttranslational levels, including
phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, sumolyation, and
methylation (39–41). Recently, p53 is shown to be regulated at
the translational level on protein synthesis by ribosomal protein

www.aacrjournals.org

L26 (42), mammalian target of rapamycin (43) or Mdm2 (44).
Interestingly, Mdm2 could either stimulate p53 synthesis via a
direct binding to p53 mRNA (44) or inhibit p53 synthesis by
promoting the degradation of L26 (45). We found that the druginduced p53 reduction did not occur at the mRNA level, as shown
by RT-qPCR analysis, but at the protein level. Failure to rescue
drug-induced p53 reduction by proteasome inhibitors and failure
of drugs to shorten the p53 protein half-life indicate that p53
reduction by the drugs is not due to enhanced p53 degradation.
The drug inhibition on metabolic labeling of newly synthesized
p53 suggests that the change occur at the level of protein
synthesis. Thus, digoxin and ouabain are potent inhibitors of p53
protein synthesis.
What is then the mechanism by which digoxin or ouabain
inhibits the de novo p53 protein synthesis? Although the details
are still unknown at the present time, it seems to involve Src/
MAPK signaling pathways, triggered and activated by ouabain/
digoxin binding to Na+/K+-ATPase because (a) ouabain or digoxin
activates Src and MAPK, (b) their inhibitors are able to abrogate
the ouabain/digoxin-induced p53 reduction, whereas (c) inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity by lowering extracellular K+
has no effect. Thus, a simplest explanation for these observations
is that upon digoxin or ouabain binding to Na+/K+-ATPase, Src/
MAPK signaling pathways are activated particularly in drugsensitive cancer cells, leading to activation of their downstream
effectors, eventually the inhibition of p53 protein synthesis.
Future effort will be directed (a) to characterize which type of p53
synthesis, cap dependent and/or cap independent, also known as
internal ribosome entry site element dependent (46), is actually
inhibited by cardiac glycosides and (b) to elucidate the detailed
mechanism of action.
Another interesting observation reported here is that cardiac
glycosides, digoxin and ouabain, are potent cytotoxic agents in a
panel of tumor cell lines with IC50s ranging from 50 to 100 nmol/L.
However, the cytotoxicity is tumor cell line dependent, but
independent of wt p53, dissociating cancer cell killing from wt
p53 elimination. Although wt p53 induces growth arrest and
apoptosis in most cases (1, 6, 7), and acts as a survival protein in
some particular cases ( for review, see ref. 47), it is unlikely that
wt p53 plays any significant role in digoxin or ouabain-induced
cell killing in few cancer cell lines tested. Nevertheless, the fact
that cardiac glycosides are inactive against wt p53 in normal
cells, but potently active in elimination of mutant p53 in some
cancer cells, suggests that these drugs could have utility in the
treatment of human cancer harboring a gain-of-function p53
mutant (48, 49).
