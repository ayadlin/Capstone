Abstract
Conjugation of cytotoxic compounds to antibodies that bind to cancer-specific antigens makes these drugs
selective in killing cancer cells. However, many of the compounds used in such antibody-drug conjugates
(ADC) are substrates for the multidrug transporter MDR1. To evade the MDR1-mediated resistance, we conjugated the highly cytotoxic maytansinoid DM1 to antibodies via the maleimidyl-based hydrophilic linker
PEG4Mal. Following uptake into target cells, conjugates made with the PEG4Mal linker were processed to a
cytotoxic metabolite that was retained by MDR1-expressing cells better than a metabolite of similar conjugates prepared with the nonpolar linker N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate
(SMCC). In accord, PEG4Mal-linked conjugates were more potent in killing MDR1-expressing cells in culture.
In addition, PEG4Mal-linked conjugates were markedly more effective in eradicating MDR1-expressing human
xenograft tumors than SMCC-linked conjugates while being tolerated similarly, thus showing an improved
therapeutic index. This study points the way to the development of ADCs that bypass multidrug resistance.

Introduction
Treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapeutic
drugs often leads to the emergence of tumors with a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (1, 2). Many mechanisms of
MDR have been described, such as the overexpression of
MDR1 (also known as P-glycoprotein or ABCB1) or other
ATP-dependent transporters that pump drugs out of the cancer cells, amplification of drug-inactivating enzymes, mutations or modifications of drug targets, alterations in DNA
repair machinery, and increased resistance to apoptosis
(1–3). The MDR1-mediated efflux of anticancer drugs is the
most commonly observed MDR phenotype clinically, and
correlations between the transporter expression and poor response to chemotherapy have been documented for many
cancer types (4, 5). To overcome MDR1-mediated resistance,
numerous MDR inhibitors or modulators have been developed and tested in clinical trials in combination with approved anticancer drugs. However, high systemic toxicity
was observed in these trials, possibly because these inhibitors
also affect the MDR1 transporter in normal tissue, giving rise

to increased accumulation of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in
normal tissue as well as in tumors (1, 4).
A promising approach to achieve targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells, thereby reducing their systemic
toxicity, is to use antibodies as specific delivery vehicles. Several highly potent cytotoxic compounds have been conjugated to tumor-targeting antibodies. A number of such
antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are currently undergoing
clinical trials, and one conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin,
has been approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (6, 7). However, the majority of cytotoxic compounds
that have been used in ADCs, such as calicheamicin (8–10),
doxorubicin, taxanes (1, 4), maytansinoids (11), analogues of
dolastatin 10 (12), and CC-1065 (13, 14), are substrates for the
MDR1 transporter, and the activity of many ADCs is poor in
MDR1-expressing cells (8–11, 15, 16).
MDR1 is believed to confer resistance to cytotoxic compounds via two mechanisms: first, by mediating the efflux of
drugs that diffuse into the plasma membrane from the extracellular space, thereby preventing the compound from reaching the cytoplasm, and second, by effluxing any compound
that does enter the cytoplasm back to the outside of the cell
(3, 17). ADCs deliver their cytotoxic payload inside cells via
antigen-mediated endocytosis, thus bypassing the first
MDR1 mechanism (16, 18). Upon intracellular processing,
conjugates are processed into cytotoxic metabolites, whose
structures depend on the chemistry of the linker between
the cytotoxic compound and the antibody (19, 20). These
metabolites may be MDR1 substrates and therefore susceptible to the second resistance mechanism, MDR1-mediated
efflux from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell.

Immunoconjugates Active against MDR Tumors

Maytansinoids, highly potent antimicrotubule agents, are
the payload of several ADCs in clinical development (7, 21).
A maytansine-resistant phenotype, linked to the expression
of MDR1, has been previously described (11, 22, 23). Building
on this observation, we first confirmed that MDR1-expressing cells were resistant to killing by maytansinoids and
maytansinoid conjugates. We then reengineered the antibody-maytansinoid conjugates to bypass this MDR1-mediated resistance. Although MDR1 has been shown to recognize
and transport a great variety of compounds sharing little
if any structural similarities, most of the reported MDR1
substrates are hydrophobic (24). We hypothesized that if
maytansinoids were attached to an antibody via a hydrophilic
linker, the resulting metabolite would be hydrophilic and,
therefore, might be a poor substrate of MDR1, thus avoiding
MDR1-mediated resistance. In this report, we describe novel
antibody-maytansinoid conjugates that, upon internalization
and processing, generate a cytotoxic metabolite that seems
to be a poor MDR1 substrate. We found that these conjugates
bypass MDR1-mediated resistance both in cultured human cell
lines and in xenograft tumors in immunodeficient mice, resulting in an increase in the therapeutic index of the conjugates.

Materials and Methods
Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. The anti–epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody (rat IgG2a developed at ImmunoGen, Inc.), the anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibody B38.1 [murine IgG1, HB 8110; American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC)], and the anti-CanAg antibody huC242 (humanized IgG1; refs. 25, 26) were modified with either N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate
(SMCC; Sigma-Aldrich) or Mal-dPEG4-NHS (QuantaBiodesign) before conjugation with DM1 (23) as described previously (27). The conjugates used in this study contained, on
average, 3.5 molecules of DM1 per antibody molecule.
Generation of COLO 205MDR cell line. The coding sequence of the human MDR1 (ABCB1) gene was cloned into
pQCXIN plasmid (BD Biosciences) and packaged using the
pantropic retroviral expression system (BD Biosciences).
COLO 205 cells (ATCC CCL-222) were transduced with
MDR1 using this vector in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, and a COLO 205 clone expressing
a functional MDR1 pump, denoted COLO 205MDR, was selected by culturing the cells in medium containing paclitaxel
(5 nmol/L) with subsequent subcloning.
Binding studies. Binding of antibodies and antibody-maytansinoid conjugates to cells was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence using flow cytometry as described
previously (28).
Rhodamine-123 accumulation and retention assays.
Cultures of HCT-15 (ATCC CCL-225), UO-31 (National Cancer
Institute-Frederick Cancer Research & Development Center,
Frederick, MD), COLO 205, and COLO 205MDR were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Inc.) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50
μg/mL gentamicin sulfate (Invitrogen) at 37°C in 6% CO2. Cell
samples (2.5 × 105 cells/mL) were treated with rhodamine-123

www.aacrjournals.org

(1.3 μmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A (5 μmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) for 90 min at 37°C. The
cells were then washed twice with HBSS containing 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum and analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells
evaluated for rhodamine-123 retention were resuspended in
culture medium with or without cyclosporin A (5 μmol/L), incubated for an additional 90 min at 37°C, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
In vitro cytotoxicity assays. Cells in 96-well plates (2 ×
103 per well) were treated with test compounds at various
concentrations in appropriate cell culture medium (total volume, 0.2 mL). Control wells containing cells and the medium
but lacking test compounds and wells containing medium
only were included in each assay plate. The plates were incubated for 4 to 6 d at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 6% CO2. WST-8 reagent (10%, v/v; Dojindo Molecular
Technologies) was then added to the wells, and the plates
were incubated at 37°C for 2 to 6 h depending on the cell line.
Then, the absorbance was measured on a plate reader spectrophotometer in the dual-wavelength mode 450 nm/650 nm,
and the absorbance at the 650 nm (nonspecific light scattering by cells) was subtracted. The apparent surviving fraction
of cells in each well was calculated by first correcting for the
medium background absorbance and then dividing each value by the average of the values in the control wells (nontreated cells). Each cytotoxicity experiment was repeated at
least twice. The data shown in the figures represent a typical
experiment.
Intracellular metabolism. COLO 205MDR cells (2 × 106/
mL) were incubated in culture medium containing a conjugate (10−8 mol/L) for 24 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed in
medium, and metabolites were extracted with acetone and
analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and by electrospray mass spectrometry as
described previously (19).
In vivo efficacy study. COLO 205, COLO 205MDR, or HCT15 cells (1 × 107 per animal) were injected s.c. in the area
under the right shoulder of female CB.17 severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories).
When the tumor volume reached average size of 130 to 140 mm3,
mice were randomized into treatment groups with similar
mean tumor volumes (n = 6 animals per group). Groups were
treated with a single i.v. bolus injection of PBS (vehicle control)
or an antibody-maytansinoid conjugate. Tumor growth was
monitored and tumor volume was calculated by the following
formula: length × width × height × 1/2.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (2.5 × 105/mL) were exposed to
conjugate (4 nmol/L of conjugated DM1) for 3 h at 37°C,
washed, and incubated in conjugate-free medium for an additional 18 h at 37°C. Cells were then fixed with 1 mL of 70%
ethanol, and DNA content was determined after staining
with propidium iodide by flow cytometry as previously described (19).
Quantification of maytansinoid metabolites. The cells
were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 μL
of 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS (pH 7.5). Cold acetone (200 μL)
was added to each sample, and the samples were then incubated on ice for 30 min, which led to protein precipitation.

Results
Human tumor cell lines that express active MDR1 show
decreased sensitivity to maytansine and to some antibodymaytansinoid conjugates. Three MDR human cell lines were
used in this study to evaluate the effect of the MDR1 transporter on maytansinoid-dependent cytotoxicity: a clone of
the colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 205 that has been
retrovirally transduced with MDR1 (COLO 205MDR) and two
naturally evolved MDR cell lines (the colon adenocarcinoma
HCT-15 and the renal adenocarcinoma UO-31). The expression of MDR1 on the plasma membrane of these cells was
confirmed by immunostaining with an anti-MDR1 antibody
(Fig. 1A). The parental MDR1-negative COLO 205 cells were
used as a negative control (Fig. 1A). The functional integrity
of the MDR1 pump was examined by the ability of the cells to
accumulate and retain the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123, a
well-established MDR1 substrate (29). The exposure of COLO
205MDR cells to rhodamine-123 resulted in a 4-fold lower
accumulation of the dye compared with that in the parental
COLO 205 cells (mean fluorescence of 700 versus 2,800) and
a 100-fold reduction in the amount of cell-associated dye

retained by the cells after incubation in dye-free medium
(mean fluorescence of 28 versus 2,800; Fig. 1B). Importantly,
in the presence of an inhibitor of MDR1, cyclosporin A (1, 3),
the COLO 205MDR cells accumulated and retained as much
rhodamine-123 as COLO 205 cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that
the reduced accumulation and retention in COLO 205MDR
cells was due to the activity of the MDR1 pump. Similar
results were obtained with other MDR1-expressing cell lines,
HCT-15 and UO-31, where cyclosporin A caused a substantial
increase in the accumulation and retention of rhodamine-123
(Fig. 1B). These results show that COLO 205MDR, HCT-15, and
UO-31 cells express active MDR1 transporter on their plasma
membrane.
To evaluate the effect of MDR1 expression on maytansinoid-induced cell killing, we compared the sensitivities of
COLO 205MDR cells and the parental cell line COLO 205 to
maytansine and its derivative DM1SMe (23). We also tested
the activity of two other antimicrotubule cytotoxic compounds, paclitaxel and vinblastine, which have previously
been shown to be MDR1 substrates (1, 3). As expected, paclitaxel and vinblastine were less potent in killing COLO 205MDR
cells than in killing COLO 205 cells (13- and 17-fold, respectively; Table 1). Similarly, sensitivity of cells to maytansine
and DM1SMe was also affected by MDR1 expression: COLO
205 MDR cells were 8-fold less sensitive to the maytansinoids
than COLO 205 cells. We also compared the cytotoxicity of

maytansine, DM1SMe, paclitaxel, and vinblastine to MDR1positive HCT-15 and UO-31 cells in the presence or absence
of the MDR1 inhibitor cyclosporin A. Maytansinoid-induced
cytotoxicity against HCT-15 and UO-31 cells was enhanced
6- to 8-fold in the presence cyclosporin A, and that of paclitaxel
and vinblastine was enhanced 10- and 18-fold, respectively
(Table 1). Cyclosporin A alone at 1 μmol/L was not cytotoxic
to the cells (data not shown). These results indicate that MDR1
activity limits the potency of these cytotoxic compounds.
To evaluate whether expression of MDR1 affects the cytotoxicity of an antibody-maytansinoid conjugate, we evaluated
the activity of an anti-EpCAM antibody-maytansinoid conjugate against the EpCAM-positive cell lines HCT-15, COLO
205MDR, and COLO 205 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table S1). The conjugate anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 was
composed of the anti-EpCAM antibody B38.1 conjugated

with the maytansinoid DM1 using the SMCC linker
(Fig. 2A). The conjugation did not affect the ability of the antibody to bind to the EpCAM-positive cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2). The anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 conjugate showed antigen-dependent cytotoxicity against the MDR1-positive
HCT-15 and COLO 205MDR cells, and the MDR1-negative
COLO 205 cells, as shown by the ability of excess unconjugated anti-EpCAM antibody to block the cell-killing activity
(Fig. 3A, top row). Cyclosporin A (Fig. 3A, top row) or another
MDR1-specific inhibitor, PGP4008 (data not shown; ref. 30),
significantly enhanced the potency of anti-EpCAM–SMCC–
DM1 against the MDR1-positive HCT-15 and COLO 205MDR
cells, but not against the MDR1-negative COLO 205 cells, indicating that MDR1 activity limits the potency of this conjugate.
In addition to the MDR1 transporter, we evaluated expression of two other ATP-dependent transporters that are

commonly expressed in tumors: multidrug resistance protein
1 (MRP1; also known as ABCC1) and breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP; also known as ABCG2; refs. 1–3, 5). COLO 205,
COLO 205MDR, HCT-15, and UO-31 cells seem to express significant amounts of the MRP1 transporter but very little of
the BCRP transporter (Supplementary Fig. S3). To evaluate
whether MRP1 reduced the sensitivity of the cells to maytansinoids and antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, we tested if
MK571, a selective MRP inhibitor (31), would enhance the
cytotoxicity of DM1SMe and anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 toward COLO 205 cells. Although the inhibitor enhanced the
cytotoxicity of the known MRP1 substrate doxorubicin
(1, 3), it did not alter the sensitivity of the cells to DM1SMe
or anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that maytansinoids are not MRP1 substrates. To test
if BCRP could reduce the cytotoxicity of maytansinoids, we
used RPMI-8226 cells, which express significant amounts of

the transporter (Supplementary Fig. S3; ref. 32) as well as
EpCAM (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table S1).
A specific inhibitor of BCRP transporter, fumitremorgin C
(33), enhanced the cytotoxicity of a known BCRP substrate
mitoxantrone (1, 3), but not of DM1SMe or anti-EpCAM–
SMCC–DM1 (Supplementary Table S2), indicating that maytansinoids and antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are not
BCRP substrates. These observations agreed with a recent
report that MDR1, but not MRP1 and BCRP, mediates
resistance to maytansinoids and antibody-maytansinoid
conjugates (11).
An anti-EpCAM–DM1 conjugate linked via PEG 4Mal
shows improved potency against MDR1-expressing cells
and tumors. Previously, it was shown that an antibodySMCC-DM1 conjugate is processed in the lysosomes of
target cells to yield a sole cytotoxic metabolite, lysineSMCC-DM1 (Fig. 2A; ref. 19). Therefore, we speculated that

Immunoconjugates Active against MDR Tumors

an antibody-maytansinoid conjugate comprising a more
polar linker moiety might yield a hydrophilic maytansinoid
metabolite that would be a poor MDR1 substrate and
thereby would show improved potency against MDR1expressing cells. To test this hypothesis, we prepared
an anti-EpCAM–DM1 conjugate using a PEG4Mal linker
(Fig. 2A). We expected that incubation of this conjugate with EpCAM-expressing cells would result in the
formation of a hydrophilic metabolite, lysine-PEG4Mal-DM1
(Fig. 2A). Indeed, incubation of EpCAM-positive COLO
205MDR cells with either anti-EpCAM–SMCC–[3H]DM1 or anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–[3H]DM1 for 24 hours yielded acetoneextractable radiolabeled compounds with retention times on
HPLC that were identical to those of synthetic lysine-SMCCDM1 or lysine-PEG4Mal-DM1, respectively (Fig. 2B). The
identities of the metabolites as lysine-SMCC-DM1 and
lysine-PEG4Mal-DM1 were confirmed in a separate experiment by electrospray mass spectrometry.
The anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 conjugate showed antigen-selective cell killing in vitro (Fig. 3A, bottom row), and
although its potency toward COLO 205 cells was equal to
that of the SMCC-linked conjugate (Fig. 3A, top row), it
was significantly higher on two MDR1-expressing cell lines:
HCT-15 and COLO 205MDR. The MDR1 inhibitor cyclosporin
A had only a marginal effect on the potency of anti-EpCAM–
PEG 4 Mal–DM1 against the MDR1-expressing cell lines
(Fig. 3A, bottom row) but significantly enhanced the potency
of SMCC-linked conjugate (Fig. 3A, top row), suggesting that
MDR1 activity limits the potency of the SMCC-linked but not
of the PEG4Mal-linked conjugate.
The improved antitumor activity of the PEG4Mal-linked
conjugate against MDR1-positive tumor cells was also apparent in human tumor xenograft studies in mice. SCID mice
bearing established HCT-15, COLO 205MDR, and COLO 205
xenografts were treated with a single i.v. injection of either
anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 or anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1
at 170, 340, or 680 μg/kg of conjugated DM1. Both conjugates
showed antigen-dependent antitumor activity in the HCT-15
tumor xenograft model (Fig. 3B) because control conjugates
that do not bind to HCT-15 cells did not affect the tumor
growth (Supplementary Fig. S4). The anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 conjugate was ∼2-fold more active than the
SMCC-linked conjugate (in Fig. 3B, compare the antitumor
activity of the anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 conjugate dosed
at 340 μg/kg DM1 with that of the anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1
conjugate dosed at 680 μg/kg DM1). The difference in the
activity of the two conjugates was even more pronounced
in the COLO 205MDR tumor xenograft model, with the antiEpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 conjugate being ∼4-fold more efficacious than the anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 conjugate, as the
activity of the 170 μg/kg DM1 dose of the PEG4Mal conjugate
was comparable with that of the 680 μg/kg DM1 dose of the
SMCC conjugate (Fig. 3B). In addition, a single treatment
with anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 at 680 μg/kg DM1 resulted
in complete regressions in all five treated mice in this MDR1positive tumor model, whereas no complete regressions were
observed at this dose with anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1. These
data agree with the in vitro cytotoxicity data showing that

www.aacrjournals.org

anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 is more active than anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 against MDR1-positive HCT-15 and COLO
205MDR tumor cell lines. The anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1
conjugate was also more efficacious than the conjugate with
SMCC linker in the MDR1-negative COLO 205 model
(Fig. 3B), albeit the advantage of the PEG4Mal linker was
greater in COLO 205MDR model (4-fold versus 2-fold).
The improved cell-killing activity of PEG4Mal-linked
conjugates toward MDR1-expressing cells is not limited
to anti-EpCAM. To test whether the enhanced activity of anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–DM1 against MDR1-expressing cells is a
general property of antibody-PEG4Mal-DM1 conjugates and
not limited to the anti-EpCAM antibody and/or target antigen, we constructed PEG4Mal- and SMCC-linked DM1 conjugates with antibodies targeting EGFR and CanAg. The human
renal adenocarcinoma cell line UO-31, a MDR cell line that
expresses both MDR1 transporter (Fig. 1A) and EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table S1), was used to
test the activity of the anti-EGFR conjugates in vitro. Although the two conjugates bound to the UO-31 cells with
similar affinity (Supplementary Fig. S2), anti-EGFR–PEG4Mal–DM1 was 7-fold more potent in killing UO-31 cells than
anti-EGFR–SMCC–DM1 (Fig. 4A). Cyclosporin A (Fig. 4A) or
another MDR1-specific inhibitor, PGP4008 (data not shown),
restored the potency of the SMCC-linked conjugate to the
level of the PEG4Mal-linked conjugate but failed to enhance
the already high cytotoxicity of PEG4Mal-linked conjugate,
suggesting that the latter is capable of evading the MDR1mediated resistance of these cells.
COLO 205 and COLO 205MDR cells, which express similar
levels of CanAg (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary
Table S1), were used to test the cytotoxicity of anti-CanAg–
DM1 conjugates linked via PEG4Mal and SMCC. Although the
two conjugates were equally potent toward COLO 205 cells
(Fig. 4B), the PEG4Mal-linked conjugate was 5-fold more potent toward COLO 205MDR cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the
in vitro results, anti-CanAg–PEG4Mal–DM1 was more efficacious than anti-CanAg–SMCC–DM1 against COLO 205MDR
tumors (Fig. 4C).
The maximum tolerated dose for a PEG4Mal-linked conjugate is similar to that of an analogous SMCC-linked conjugate in mice. The tolerability of anti-CanAg–SMCC–DM1
and anti-CanAg–PEG4Mal–DM1 was tested in CD1 mice.
This antibody has no cross-reactivity with mouse tissues.
Toxicity was monitored by frequent body weight measurements in groups of mice treated with a single i.v. bolus of
either conjugate at approximately 1.8 and 2.7 mg/kg of conjugated DM1. Similar changes in body weight compared with
control were observed for each conjugate, with some mortality observed in the high-dose group for both conjugates, suggesting that the maximum tolerated doses for the two
conjugates are similar, ∼2.2 mg/kg (Fig. 4D).
A PEG4Mal-linked conjugate is more effective than an
analogous SMCC-linked conjugate in arresting COLO
205MDR cells in the G2-M phase. Maytansinoids and antibody-maytansinoid conjugates arrest dividing cells in the
G2-M phase of the cell cycle (19), an event that ultimately
leads to cell death. We compared the antimitotic activities

in COLO 205 and COLO 205MDR cells. The cells were incubated with either conjugate for 3 hours, then washed to remove
unbound conjugate, and incubated for an additional 18 hours
in the conjugate-free medium. The percentage of cells in the
G2-M phase was then determined by flow cytometry. COLO
205 cells were equally sensitive to the two conjugates, with
an increase in cells in the G2-M phase after treatment from
27% to 85% and 88% (Fig. 5A). In contrast, COLO 205MDR cells
were less sensitive to anti-CanAg–SMCC–DM1 than to the
PEG4Mal-linked conjugate. The percentage of cells in the
G2-M phase went up from 15% to 37% in the anti-CanAg–

metabolites within the cells, COLO 205 and COLO 205MDR

cells were incubated with either anti-CanAg–PEG4Mal–[3H]
DM1 or anti-CanAg–SMCC–[3H]DM1 under conditions identical to those in the cell cycle experiments. The metabolites
lysine-PEG4Mal-[3H]DM1 and lysine-SMCC-[3H]DM1 produced during the incubation and retained in the cells were
then extracted as in Fig. 2B, and their amounts were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Similar levels of metabolites were detected in COLO 205 cells treated with either
conjugate. However, the level of maytansinoid metabolites in
COLO 205MDR cells incubated with the SMCC-linked conjugate was ∼50% lower than that in the cells treated with
the PEG4Mal-linked conjugate (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the enhanced cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest activity of the PEG4Mal-linked conjugates against MDR1-positive cells can be
explained by increased intracellular retention of the active
maytansinoid metabolite.
MDR1 transporter activity is not affected in the cells
treated with PEG4Mal-linked conjugates. It has been reported previously that polyethylene glycol can inhibit the
transporter activity of MDR1 in vitro (34). To test whether

Mal-DM1, inhibits the transporter activity, COLO 205 MDR
cells were incubated with either anti-EpCAM–PEG4Mal–
DM1 or anti-EpCAM–SMCC–DM1 for 3 hours at a concentration that can cause substantial killing followed by 18
hours in conjugate-free medium to allow for accumulation
of the metabolites within the cells. The activity of MDR1
transporter was then tested using the rhodamine-123
accumulation and retention assay as described in Fig. 1. In
contrast to that observed upon treatment with cyclosporin
A (Fig. 1B), the treatment of cells with either conjugate did
not alter the levels of rhodamine-123 accumulation and
retention (Fig. 5C). In addition, incubation of the cells with
lysine-PEG4Mal-DM1 directly did not inhibit MDR1 activity
(data not shown). Therefore, inhibition of the transporter
by the PEG4Mal-containing metabolite is unlikely.

Discussion
Several antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are presently
in clinical trials for patients with multiple myeloma, non–
Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and
other solid tumors (6, 7, 35, 36). Patients with these cancers
often develop MDR1-mediated multidrug resistance. Similar

to other cytotoxic compounds used in ADCs, such as calicheamicin, dolastatin 10, and CC-1065 analogues (4, 8, 10,
12–14), maytansine is a substrate for the MDR1 transporter,
and consequently, the transporter can reduce the potency of
some antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. Because preferred
substrates for the MDR1 transporter are hydrophobic compounds (24), we reasoned that the potency of antibodymaytansinoid conjugates toward MDR1-positive cells could
be improved by increasing the hydrophilicity of the maytansinoid metabolites released from conjugates inside the cell,
thereby avoiding MDR1-mediated efflux. To achieve this,
we used an ethylene glycol tetramer (PEG 4 )–containing
linker. The observed metabolite, lysine-PEG 4 Mal-DM1,
was retained inside MDR1-expressing cells better than the
lysine-SMCC-DM1 metabolite from an analogous SMCClinked conjugate. The increased retention of the metabolite
of PEG4Mal-linked conjugate correlated with the greater
antimitotic and cytotoxic potency of the conjugate toward
MDR1-expressing cells in vitro and with its increased efficacy
against MDR1-positive xenograft tumors.
We showed that PEG4Mal linkers can bestow the ability to
bypass MDR1-mediated resistance to any antibody-maytansinoid conjugate. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates with this

linker were as cytotoxic to MDR1-expressing cells as they were
to MDR1-negative cells or to MDR cells whose MDR1 activity
was inhibited, suggesting that the PEG4Mal-linked conjugates
were capable of evading the MDR1-mediated resistance. Significantly, the advantage of the linker was observed for the
conjugates of antibodies that recognize three different antigens: anti-EpCAM, anti-EGFR, and anti-CanAg. Although the
PEG4 Mal-linked conjugate was more efficacious than the
SMCC-linked conjugate in MDR tumor models, the two conjugates were equally well tolerated in mice. Thus, incorporation of a short PEG oligomer within the conjugate linker
improved the therapeutic index of the antibody-maytansinoid
conjugate against the MDR1-expressing tumors.
There are several possible explanations for the enhanced
potency of the PEG4Mal-linked conjugates in MDR1-expressing cells. First, PEG4Mal-linked conjugates or their metabolites might inhibit MDR1-mediated efflux. The unaltered
activity of the transporter in the cells pretreated with cytotoxic concentrations of a PEG4Mal-linked conjugate (Fig. 5C)
or its cellular metabolite, lysine-PEG 4 Mal-DM1, argues
against this hypothesis. Second, the resulting lysine-PEG4Mal-DM1 metabolite may bind tighter to its intracellular
target, β-tubulin, than maytansine or lysine-SMCC-DM1,
thereby reducing the amount of active metabolite needed
to kill the cell and/or reducing the intracellular free metabolite pool available to interact with the MDR1 pump.
Although we cannot rule out this possibility at present, the
similar potencies of the conjugates with the PEG4Mal and
SMCC linkers in non-MDR cells suggest that this hypothesis
is unlikely. Another possible explanation is that the lysinePEG4Mal-DM1 metabolite may be a poor MDR1 substrate
due to its low affinity for the transporter. Finally, the PEG4Mal-containing metabolite may simply have limited accessibility to the transporter. According to several reports, the
binding of a substrate to MDR1 occurs only after diffusion
of the substrate into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane (37–39). The increased hydrophilicity of the PEG 4Mal-containing metabolite may diminish its partitioning
into the plasma membrane and, therefore, prevent interaction with the transporter. Indeed, lysine-PEG4Mal-DM1 is
∼8-fold less cytotoxic than lysine-SMCC-DM1 (data not

shown), suggesting that the former has limited ability to penetrate the plasma membrane.
Hydrophilic (or polar) linkers have not been used to bypass multidrug resistance previously. However, our analysis
of two prior studies suggests that the polarity of a released
metabolite may have enhanced the cytotoxicity of two nonmaytansinoid ADCs to MDR cells. Hamann and colleagues
(16) reported that substitution of a hydrazide group by an
amide in the linker of an antibody-calicheamicin conjugate
rendered this ADC more efficacious against MDR cells. Although the authors did not explain the mechanism of this
phenomenon, we speculate that the conjugate with the pHsensitive hydrazide linker was reduced to a hydrophobic
calicheamicin, whereas the noncleavable amide-linked conjugate was processed to a polar amino acid–containing derivative that might be a poor MDR1 substrate. In another study,
ADC of a polar version of the cytotoxic compound auristatin
was able to kill MDR cells (20). However, it is not clear if the
potency of this conjugate could be attributed to the polarity
of the drug because the potency of ADC of the original nonpolar auristatin was not reported.
In conclusion, our finding that the antitumor potency of
antibody-maytansinoid conjugates can be improved by
rational linker design suggests that this strategy may be also
effective in improving the potency of immunoconjugates
with other cytotoxic molecules, paving the way for a new
generation of ADCs that are more active against MDR tumors.
