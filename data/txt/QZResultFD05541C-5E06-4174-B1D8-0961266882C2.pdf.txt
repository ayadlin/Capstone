BACKGROUND: Level I evidence indicates that neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, in combination with radical cystectomy (RC), is associated with a significant survival advantage for patients with muscle-invasive bladder
cancer. Despite this, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not uniformly used. Our objective was to determine the patterns
of utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients undergoing RC for muscle invasive bladder cancer in a contemporary cohort in a tertiary care center. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with bladder
cancer who underwent RC between 2003 and 2008 at our institution. Clinical stage, pathologic stage, renal function,
and perioperative chemotherapy treatments were tabulated. Primary outcome measures were the type and use of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy among eligible patients. Secondary measures were the utilization patterns of adjuvant
chemotherapy, renal function, pathologic outcomes, and disease specific and overall survival. Reasons for nonutilization of chemotherapy were also examined. RESULTS: Among 238 patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer, 145
had a preoperative clinical stage T2. Only 17% (25 of 145) of these patients received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. The renal function was adequate (CrCl > 60 ml/min) in 97 (67%) of these patients. Patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had higher p0 rates (29% vs 8%) than patients who did not receive neoadjuvant
therapy. Advanced patient age, comorbidities, concerns over toxicity of chemotherapy, and the modest nature of
benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy may explain why this treatment is not often used. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
level I evidence, neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapies continue to be underutilized in the management of
bladder cancer, even at a high-volume tertiary center. A prospective evaluation of management choices, including the
patient and physician factors involved in the use of perioperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in bladder cancer, is

KEYWORDS: chemotherapy, bladder cancer, radical cystectomy, utilization, cisplatin.

With 68,000 new cases diagnosed each year, cancer of the bladder is the fourth most common cancer, and causes more
than 13,000 deaths in the United States alone.1,2 Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer comprise less than a third
of reported cases, but have a worse prognosis because of higher risk of progression, development of metastasis, and death.
While radical cystectomy represents the primary therapeutic modality for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder
cancer, several studies have shown that a combined approach of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and surgery is
associated with improved survival in comparison to surgery alone.3-5 In 2003, a phase III clinical trial (SWOG-8710)
showed a survival benefit in patients who received both neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (3 cycles of MVAC:
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) and radical cystectomy, compared with those who underwent radical cystectomy alone (77 months vs 46 months). Several analyses have confirmed that neoadjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy
in combination with surgery has a modest survival benefit (5%), with those patients achieving a complete pathological
response after chemotherapy having the best outcome.6,7
The data from SWOG-8710 and subsequent meta-analyses are compelling, with a number needed to treat (NNT)
estimated at 20. Similar or higher NNT outcomes in breast cancer have led to the institution and widespread administration of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments as standard of care.8 However, despite such evidence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not uniformly used for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.9

Current Use of Perioperative Cisplatin Chemotherapy In Bladder Cancer/Raj et al

The use of perioperative chemotherapy in a contemporary cohort (after the publication of SWOG-8710) was
examined, including an evaluation of the factors involved
in such decision-making. We report an underutilization
of perioperative chemotherapy, positing that a prospective
evaluation of the factors involved in decision-making will
help elucidate why patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy do not receive this.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Approval was obtained through the UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board for this study. A retrospective review was performed of all patients who
underwent radical cystectomy at our institution from 2003
to 2008. Demographics for all patients, as well as clinical
and pathologic stage, were determined from reviewing medical records. Clinical stage was derived from cystoscopy with
transurethral resection of bladder tumor, examination
under anesthesia, and preoperative imaging. Preoperative
imaging was routinely obtained within 4 weeks of the diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Patients were included if information on clinical stage,
pathologic stage, renal function, and use or nonuse of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was available. Patients
with nontransitional cell histologies on transurethral
resection pathology were excluded.
Intraoperative Technique and Postoperative
Surveillance
All patients underwent an open radical cystectomy with
bilateral pelvic lymph dissection. Lymph node dissection
routinely included the obturator, internal iliac, external
iliac, common iliac, presacral, and distal preaortic and
precaval lymph nodes, with distal extent of dissection to
the bifurcation of the aorta. Patients were observed postoperatively on average every 3 months for the first year
and then every 6 months after that, with basic laboratory,
cross sectional imaging, and physical exam. Patients with
pathologic T3 or T4 disease or positive lymph nodes were
considered eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy.
Estimation of Renal Function
Glomerular filtration rates (GFR) prior to and 3 months
after surgery were estimated respectively by the MDRD
equation, as described below:
GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) ¼ 175  (Scr)1.154 
(Age)0.203  (0.742 if female)  (1.210 if African
American).

Similar analyses were performed using the CockroftGault equation, shown below, to evaluate creatinine
clearance.
GFR (mL/min) ¼ (140-age) * (Wt in kg) * (0.85 if
female) / (72 * Cr)
An estimated GFR or creatinine clearance cutoff of
60 ml/min was used to evaluate eligibility for cisplatinbased chemotherapy. Overall findings using both the
MDRD and the Cockroft-Gault equation indicate similar
conclusions. For the sake of brevity and clarity, only the
results from the MDRD equation are tabulated.
Use of Perioperative Chemotherapy
We investigated whether patients undergoing radical cystectomy for a clinical stage T2 received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (eligibility criteria for SWOG-8710).
In addition, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for
patients with pathologic stage T3 or positive lymph
nodes on the radical cystectomy specimen was examined.
Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meier curves were created for disease-specific and
overall survival. A Cox regression analysis using age, sex,
extravesicular disease (T3 or T4), lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
and preoperative renal function was performed to determine prognostic indicators. A Pearson chi-square test or
Fisher exact probability test was used to compare noncontinuous variables. Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0
statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
From 2003 to 2008, there were 238 patients who underwent RC at our institution for transitional cell bladder
cancer (Table 1). The mean follow-up was 21.3 months
(range 0.2 to 69.7, median 16.2). A majority of patients
(70%) undergoing RC had estimated renal function
adequate for cisplatin-based therapy (Table 2).
Eligibility for and Use of Neoadjuvant
Chemotherapy
Among these 238 patients, 145 had a preoperative clinical
stage T2. According to the SWOG-8710 trial, these persons could have benefited from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Of these 145 patients, only 32 (22%) received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. These 32 patients included 7 who received
non-cisplatin based chemotherapy. Overall, only 25 of 145
(17%) patients with preoperative clinical stage T2
received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. These

include 22 of 128 (17%) patients with clinical stage T2, 3
of 9 (33%) patients with clinical stage T3, and 7 of 8 (88%)
patients with clinical stage T4 (Table 3a). Excluding T4
patients, those who actually received optimal cisplatin-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinical stage T2 or T3 drops
further to 13% (18 of 137).
Reasons for not giving neoadjuvant chemotherapy
are limited by the retrospective nature of the review, but
appear to include concerns over patient age and/or comorbidities in 29, patient preference in 9, toxicity of chemotherapy in 12, symptoms or active bleeding in 6 patients,
and/or clinically localized or resectable cancer in 19. In 66
patients, a satisfactory reason for excluding neoadjuvant
chemotherapy could not be established.
Cisplatin can cause renal toxicity, and compromised
renal function is often cited as the reason for avoiding cisplatin-based therapy. We examined if eligibility for cisplatin-based therapy could explain the reason for its low
utilization. Of the 145 patients with a preoperative clinical stage T2, 97 (70%) were eligible for cisplatin-based
chemotherapy on the basis of estimated GFR >60 ml/
min by the MDRD equation (Table 2). Similar proportions were observed with the usage of creatinine clearance
cutoffs of 60ml/min/1.73m2 by the Cockroft-Gault equation (69%) or the Jelliffe equation (66%).
Only 14% (14 of 97) patients eligible by MDRD criteria received neoadjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy. At our
institution, measured creatinine clearances were used as well
to determine eligibility for cisplatin-based therapy. An additional 11 patients with a MDRD calculated GFR <60ml/
min were found to have either hydrated or measured creati-

received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, only 25 of 145 (17%) patients with preoperative clinical
stage T2 received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All of the patients referred to a medical oncologist
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Eligibility for and Use of Adjuvant
Chemotherapy
Following RC, 124 patients had a pathologic stage
T3109 and/or positive lymph nodes,65 and by criteria
were at high risk for recurrence (Table 3b). Of these 124
patients at high risk for recurrence after surgery alone, 47
(38%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Of the patients
with pathologic stage T3 and negative nodes (n¼59),
10% (6 of 59) received adjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, 63% (41 of 65) of patients with nodal positive disease received adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary
reasons for not giving adjuvant chemotherapy included
age and/or comorbidities in 17, patient preference in 20,
pathologic stageT3a with negative surgical margins and
no nodal involvement in 17, prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 3, and death before follow-up in 6; 14 patients
were not available. More than a third of the patients (25
of 72) referred to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy did not receive it.
Of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy,
43 (92%) received cisplatin-based therapy and 4 (9%)
received carboplatin or taxol-based therapy. Among the
124 patients at high risk for recurrence, 86 (69%) were eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy based on GFR
>60 ml/min. Thirty-eight of 86 (44%) high-risk patients
eligible by MDRD criteria received adjuvant chemotherapy, including 35 (41%) who received cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Again, an additional 8 patients with an

Overall, of the cohort of 238 patients undergoing
radical cystectomy at our institution, only 25 preoperative
clinical stage T2 or greater and 35 high-risk postoperative
patients received optimal neoadjuvant and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, respectively.
Survival, Recurrence, and Metastasis
Outcomes
The mean follow-up for our cohort of patients was 21.3
months (range 0.2 to 69.9, median 16.2). By KaplanMeier survival analysis, the mean overall and disease-specific survival times were 43.9 and 46.5 months, respectively, with 67 patients dying of bladder cancer at a mean
time of 15.8 months (range 0.2-57.5, median 10.9). In
our follow-up period, 51 patients developed metastasis at
a mean time of 12.4 months (range 1.2-54.6, median
8.2), with 39 of those patients dying of bladder cancer. In
addition, 56 patients developed a recurrence at a mean
time of 12.7 months (range 1.2-62.0, median 8.4), with
39 of those patients dying of bladder cancer.
Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a
higher probability of pathologic T0 disease than patients
who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (28% vs
8%, P ¼ .002, 2-tailed Fisher exact probability test).

Cancer

January 15, 2011

There was no statistically significant difference in survival
for patients who did and did not receive neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (P > 0.8, log rank test). In a multivariate
analysis of the 145 patients eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not an independent predictor of increased disease-specific or overall
survival (Table 4).
Effect of Adjuvant Chemotherapy
In a multivariate analysis of the 124 patients eligible for
adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy was a
significant independent predictor of increased overall and
disease-specific survival, with hazard ratios of 0.507 (95%
CI, 0.275-0.937) and 0.512 (95% CI, 0.263-0.995),
respectively (Table 4). Of the 59 patients with extravesical
disease and negative nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy was
given to 10% of patients; however, 36% developed metastasis and 34% died from bladder cancer. Among patients
with a pathologic stage of T3a with negative surgical margins and negative nodes (n¼36), only 1 patient received
adjuvant chemotherapy. Yet 39% developed metastasis
and 31% died of bladder cancer in our follow-up period.

DISCUSSION
Bladder cancer is a chemosensitive malignancy. Cisplatin
is the single most active chemotherapeutic agent against
bladder cancer. Carboplatin is often substituted for cisplatin in the management of patients with metastatic bladder
cancer, especially in the setting of renal insufficiency.10
However, several trials have indicated that carboplatin is
inferior to cisplatin in the management of patients with
bladder cancer.11,12 In addition, there are only a limited
number of small non-randomized trials on the utility of
carboplatin in the perioperative setting.13,14
Since its introduction, cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy has been the standard of care in treating
patients with locally advanced and metastatic transitional
cell carcinoma in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic
settings.15-20 Data from 2 large randomized trials of cisplatin-based chemotherapy and a meta-analysis composed
of 3005 patients indicate that neoadjuvant cisplatin-based
chemotherapy is associated with a significant survival benefit in the 30%-40% patients who achieve a complete
pathological response.6,7 Our study did not show a survival difference between patients who did and did not
receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but there was a significant difference between pathologic T0 rates with nearly
30% of the neoadjuvant patients achieving pathologic T0.

The absence of demonstrable survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this cohort may be related to short
follow-up and small cohort size.
The true proportion of patients deemed ineligible
for cisplatin-based chemotherapy is not known. In the
International Bladder Cancer study, 45.3% of the patients
(106 of 234) with clinical stage T2-4a, Nx, M0 bladder
cancer were deemed ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy.21 Patients deemed ineligible for cisplatin-based
chemotherapy had worse overall and cancer-specific survival outcomes (31%, 3-year overall survival) than
patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy
(62%, 3-year overall survival). However, the relative contribution of chemotherapy and comorbidities (other than
renal dysfunction) that affect survival was not known.
With the increasing use of mathematic formulas to
calculate CrCl to determine renal eligibility, a calculated
CrCl cutoff of 60 mL/min or GFR <60 mL/min/1.73
m2 has been used to determine renal eligibility for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Dash et al have shown that, in
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering experience, the overall proportion of patients deemed ineligible for cisplatin-based
chemotherapy was 28% using the CG formula.22 Our
findings agree with this prior report, with 32%-33% of
patients with clinical stage T2 or higher not meeting the
cutoff either by the Cockroft-Gault or MDRD formulas.
By present standards, these patients either would have
been given no treatment or inferior carboplatin-based regimens, and may have had worse survival outcomes.23
Previously, we had shown that formulas to calculate
creatinine clearances are unreliable and that up to 39% of
patients with calculated CrCl <60 mL/min would have
been eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy by evaluating
measured CrCl using the same cutoff of 60 mL/min.23 We
had also shown that ineligibility from calculated CrCls,
using the cutoff of 60 mL/min, was not significantly associ-

280

ated with the ability to receive at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy. At our institution, we re-evaluate all patients with an
estimated CrCl <60 and obtain a hydrated CrCl or measured CrCl using a 24-hour urine collection. Consequently,
17 patients who would not have received cisplatin-based
chemotherapy on the basis of arbitrary CrCl cutoffs received
and tolerated chemotherapy.
In our study, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with p0 rate of 27%, similar to the 30% rate reported
in the SWOG trial. Importantly, only patients receiving
cisplatin-based therapy—and none of the patients receiving carboplatin-based therapies— achieved p0. Since
most of our patients in this cohort received the doublet of
gemcitabine and cisplatin, these data indicate that similar
rates of pathologic downstaging may be seen with gemcitabine and cisplatin as reported for MVAC.3,7 Although
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our cohort was not associated with a survival advantage, this may reflect the higher
stage of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
a lack of randomization. The lower p0 rates and lack of a
survival benefit may also in part be attributed to the agents
used (GC vs MVAC).
Reasons why neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not
offered in this cohort included patient symptoms, patient
preference, patient age and comorbidities, physician preference, and no clinical signs of disease progression (ie,
lymphadenopathy). Furthermore, surgeons may not want
to delay surgical treatment when there is bulky disease.
Some of these reasons may reflect a lack of confidence in
the published data to date, concerns over the toxicity and
tolerability of chemotherapy, the modest nature of the
benefit from neoadjuvant cisplatin-based therapy, and the
desire to reserve chemotherapy for an adjuvant or salvage
setting. Additional variables, such as the presence of lymphovascular invasion in the TURBT specimen and preoperative hydronephrosis, may influence the decision for

chemotherapy in some patients. However, given the retrospective nature of this study, we are not able to discern the
number of patients who may have received chemotherapy
because of these confounders. The primary limitation is
that most patients were referred to our center after having
had a TURBT, and the presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion in a TURBT specimen is not uniformly
noted. As a result of these concerns, the NCCN and the
EAU guidelines both indicate that neoadjuvant chemotherapy only be ‘‘considered’’ (not mandated) in patients
with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Several ongoing
studies are attempting to identify subsets of patients who
will receive the most benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy using tissue biomarkers, prognostic models such
as nomograms, and pathologic characteristics such as lymphovascular invasion.
Our data indicate that perioperative chemotherapy
is underused, even in a high-volume tertiary carereferral
center committed to multimodality therapy. In an analysis of 7161 patients with stage III bladder cancer from the
National Cancer Database, perioperative chemotherapy
was only administered to 11.6% of patients, with 10.4%
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and 1.2% receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.9 Our utilization patterns are also
weighted towards adjuvant chemotherapy, with 34% of
patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and only 20%
receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is interesting that
these utilization patterns are not supported by Level I evidence, which endorses only neoadjuvant chemotherapy.7,24,25 Numerous studies indicate that fewer patients
undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, partly because of
delayed recovery and complications following surgery,
patient refusal, poor performance status, and psychological distress.24-28 Despite a clear lack of evidence supporting adjuvant chemotherapy, its utilization in our tertiary
center and the National Cancer Database may reflect the
desire of clinicians to decide on chemotherapy on the basis
of pathologic rather than clinical staging parameters.26
Analysis of our small cohort shows a survival advantage for patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy.
While these data are not adequately powered, randomized, or prospective, they may support the rationale for
delaying chemotherapy until after RC. Interestingly, our
data indicate that patients with pathologic stage T3a, negative lymph nodes, and negative surgical margins are still
at significant risk for recurrence and mortality from bladder cancer. These data suggest that patients with pathologic stage T3 or positive nodes should be strongly
considered for adjuvant chemotherapy.

Cancer

Due to the retrospective nature of this study, the attributable factors suffer from a recall bias and are not analyzable. Moreover, as this study only examines patients
undergoing RC, these data may underestimate the true
number of patients with clinical stage >T2 referred for or
who underwent chemotherapy. To further evaluate the
reasons for failure of urologists in tertiary referral centers
to prescribe neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a prospective
evaluation of treatment decisions needs to be performed
and is underway. We hope to understand institutional
and personal preferences that affect the use of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in bladder cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
Bladder cancer is chemosensitive, and current evidence
suggests neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve outcomes. However, neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapies continue to be underutilized in the management
of bladder cancer, even in a contemporary cohort at a
high-volume tertiary center. Adjuvant cisplatin-based
chemotherapy also appears to be underutilized, even in
patients at high risk for recurrence. Compromised renal
function does not explain the low use of cisplatin-based
chemotherapies. A prospective evaluation of the management choices and patient/physician factors involved in the
use of perioperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in bladder cancer is indicated.
