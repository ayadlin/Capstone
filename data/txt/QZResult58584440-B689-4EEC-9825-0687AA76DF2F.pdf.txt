Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common aggressive brain cancer with a median survival of
approximately 1 year. In a search for novel molecular targets that could be therapeutically developed, our
kinome-focused microarray analysis identified the MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase-interacting kinase 1
(MNK1) as an attractive theranostic candidate. MNK1 overexpression was confirmed in both primary GBMs and
glioma cell lines. Inhibition of MNK1 activity in GBM cells by the small molecule CGP57380 suppressed eIF4E
phosphorylation, proliferation, and colony formation whereas concomitant treatment with CGP57380 and the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin accentuated growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
MNK1 expression reduced proliferation of cells incubated with rapamycin. Conversely, overexpression of fulllength MNK1 reduced rapamycin-induced growth inhibition. Analysis of polysomal profiles revealed inhibition
of translation in CGP57380 and rapamycin-treated cells. Microarray analysis of total and polysomal RNA from
MNK1-depleted GBM cells identified mRNAs involved in regulation of TGF-b pathway. Translation of SMAD2
mRNA as well as TGF-b–induced cell motility and vimentin expression was regulated by MNK1 signaling. Tissue
microarray analysis revealed a positive correlation between the immunohistochemical staining of MNK1 and
SMAD2. Taken together, our findings offer insights into how MNK1 pathways control translation of cancerrelated mRNAs including SMAD2, a key component of the TGF-b signaling pathway. Furthermore, they suggest
MNK1-controlled translational pathways in targeted strategies to more effectively treat GBM. Cancer Res; 71(6);

Introduction
In the last decade, genetic profiling of brain tumors has
improved our understanding of gliomagenesis and led to the
development of many targeted therapies based on molecular
interference with deregulated signaling networks (1–3).
Although many screens have characterized and proposed
the targeting of deregulated signaling pathways for therapeutic interference, recent reports have identified therapy
resistance based on the compensatory activation of
alternative signaling pathways. Thus, effective treatment

requires combined regimens targeting the glioblastoma
kinome (4–7).
The overall rate of protein synthesis is an important determinant of cancer cell metabolism (8). Many previous observations have indicated that deregulated growth pathways in
human cancers are involved in the control of translation
supporting cell proliferation and survival. In response to
nutrients and growth factors, activated AKT/mTOR pathways
enhance global protein synthesis. They phosphorylate and
inactivate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (eIF4E-BP), a repressor of mRNA translation and
activate ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) involved in ribosome
biogenesis (9). Kinases associated with translation initiation
complexes have a potential for regulating translation. MAP
(mitogen-activated protein) kinase-interacting kinases
(MNK1/2) can bind to translation initiation factor, eIF4G,
and phosphorylate the cap-binding protein, the translation
initiation factor eIF4E (10). The phosphorylation of eIF4E on
Ser209 is increased in cancer cells and eIF4E expression levels
are upregulated in many tumors (11–13). Recent findings
demonstrate that eIF4E phosphorylation by MNKs is absolutely required for the eIF4E activity that opposes apoptosis
and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo (14). In addition, MNKs
can also phosphorylate RNA-binding protein, hnRNPA1,
which binds AU-rich elements of messenger RNA (e.g.,

TNF-a), thereby regulating its stability and/or translation (15).
Thus, MNK signaling appears to play an important role
in posttranscriptional regulation of cancer-related gene
expression.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and chemicals
MNK1 (C4C1), p-MNK1 (Thr197/202), SMAD2 (86F7), pSMAD2 (Ser245/250/255), eIF4E (C46H6), p-eIF4E (Ser209), pS6 (Ser235/236), p38 (9212), p-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), ERK1/2

Santa Cruz Biotechnology, vimentin (V9) from Thermo Scientific and generated a-tubulin YL1/2 was used as hybridoma
supernatant. CGP57380 and rapamycin were from Sigma,
RAD001 from Novartis, SB431542 from Tocris, and TGF-b
from PeproTech.
Patients
Primary glioma tissues obtained from the operating room
were processed as previously described (16) in accordance
with the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of the University
Hospitals of Basel and Dusseldorf. Tumors were diagnosed
and graded according to the current WHO Classification. The
patient set is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Cell culture and standard techniques
Human glioma cells: BS125, LN18, LN229, BS149, LN319,
LN405, LN215, LN71, U343MG, U373, U87MG, Hs683, A172, and
M059K were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS
(fetal calf serum) and antibiotics at 37 C and 5% CO2. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)–derived BS287 spheres were cultured as described previously (17). Clonetics normal human
astrocytes (NHA) were from Cambrex and cultured according
to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection, treatments, cellular assays, including proliferation, viability, colony
formation, flow cytometry as well as RNA and protein isolation
followed by quantitative real-time PCR, microarray hybridization, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry are
described in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
Microarray data analysis
Data mining and visualization of microarray-profiled gliomas were performed using Genedata's Analyst 4.1 package.
Median fold ratio values at P < 0.05 in the t test were used for
analysis. All samples were quintile normalized and median
scaled to correct for minor variations in their expression
distributions. The data obtained have been deposited in the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE15824). Polysomal profiles (triplicate experiment for transfection and
inhibitor treatments) and RNA extraction was accomplished
as previously described (18) and used for microarray hybridization described in Supplementary Material. Data analysis
was carried out using R/Bioconductor (19). Signal condensation was performed using the RMA from the Bioconductor
Affy package. Differentially expressed genes were identified by

the empirical Bayes method (F test) implemented in the
LIMMA package and adjusted with the false discovery rate
method (20). Visualization was done in R. Probe sets with a
log2 average contrast signal of at least 5, an adjusted P value of
< 0.05, and an absolute log2 fold-change of greater than 0.585
(1.5-fold in linear space) were used.
Cell motility
Forty-eight hours after transfection or 24 hours after treatment, a scratch was made and the migration of cells was
monitored using a live-imaging system Widefield TILL5, Long
Run, Axiovert 200M (Carl Zeiss). Images were captured every
20 minutes over a period of 22 hours with a CCD camera using
MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using
ImageJ software (NIH).

Results
MNK1 overexpression in human glioblastoma
Microarray analysis of 30 brain tumor samples was performed including 15 high-grade gliomas (glioblastomas) and
15 low-grade tumors (8 astrocytomas and 7 oligodendrogliomas). Kinase expression in each tumor was normalized to the
expression levels in normal brain and expression values from
NHAs were used as an additional control. Apart from kinases
known to be associated with gliomagenesis (e.g., EGFR; data
not shown), a further protein kinase was found to be upregulated in primary glioblastomas. The transcript level of
MNK1 was upregulated more than 2-fold in 12 of 15 glioblastomas and in 5 of 8 astrocytomas (P < 0.01 for both groups,
compared with expression in normal brain and human normal
astrocytes) whereas 3 of 7 patients exhibited elevated MNK1
levels in oligodendroglioma (Fig. 1A). MNK2 kinase expression
was not significantly altered in the human gliomas analyzed
(data not shown). There was no significant correlation
between MNK1 expression and survival in profiled glioma
patients. Changes in MNK1 expression were further validated
by real-time PCR. In 10 of 11 glioblastoma samples, MNK1 was
elevated more than 2-fold (Fig. 1B). Human MNK1 arises from
an alternatively spliced transcript giving rise to 2 isoforms,
longer MNK1a (50 kDa) and a shorter MNK1b variant (38 kDa)
that lacks 89 C-terminal amino acids (21). We determined
MNK1a protein levels in GBM tumors and cell lines using an
MNK1a-specific monoclonal antibody. An increase in MNK1
kinase was observed in 14 of 20 (70%) primary glioblastomas
and in 11 of 13 (84%) glioma cell lines, compared with normal
brain and NHAs, respectively (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical
analysis of tumor sections from 12 GBM patients and tissue
arrays containing 34 GBMs and 5 normal brains also demonstrated high MNK1 protein levels, with stronger cytoplasmic
signals in GBM cells than in weakly stained normal brain
(Fig. 1D). Antibody specificity was tested on whole protein cell
lysates (Fig. 1C) and on formalin-fixed BS125 cells (Fig. 1D)
transfected with siRNA against the MNK1 gene or luciferase
(control). MNK1 phosphorylation correlated with total level of
MNK1 (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.51) and was significantly
higher in 7 of 11 (64%) GBM patients than in normal human
brain and astrocytes (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1). To

investigate whether MNK1 expression is regulated by EGFR,
which is often amplified and hyperactivated in GBM, the
correlation between MNK1 and EGFR was analyzed in glioma
patients and in GBM cell lines. Microarray analysis showed no
significant correlation between MNK1 and EGFR in human
gliomas (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.29). There was also no
correlation between MNK1 and EGFR or phopho-EGFR levels
in analyzed GBM cells (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Likewise, treatment with the EGFR inhibitor AEE788 did not
affect the MNK1 protein level indicating that MNK1 expression is not regulated by EGFR pathways.
Inhibition of MNK1 reduces GBM cell proliferation and
colony formation and acts additively with rapamycin
To investigate MNK1 as a potential therapeutic target, a
pharmacologic approach was first taken using an efficient
inhibitor of MNK kinases, CGP57380 (22). As MNK1 signaling
is involved in the regulation of translation, inhibition of MNK1
was combined with the targeting of mTOR pathways, which
also act at the translational level. Treatment with either
CGP57380 or rapamycin alone reduced proliferation and their
combination had an additive effect on human GBM cell lines
BS125, LN319, LN405, and BS287 spheres (Fig. 2A and Sup-

plementary Fig. S3). There was a synergistic effect at the
highest concentrations of CGP57380 (10 mmol/L) and rapamycin (10 nmol/L), with combination index values of 0.71 and
0.63 in BS125 and LN319 cells, respectively. Concomitant
treatments with CGP57380 and rapamycin over 5 days greatly
reduced BS125 and LN319 cell number (data not shown). The
observed additive inhibitory effect was confirmed further
using CGP57380 together with the rapamycin derivative
RAD001 in BS125 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). The effects
of inhibitor treatments were monitored by immunoblotting
using phospho-specific antibodies against eIF4E (treatment
with CGP57380) and ribosomal protein S6 (treatment with
rapamycin; Fig. 2B, right). CGP57380 at 2 mmol/L or rapamycin
at 0.5 nmol/L was sufficient to decrease significantly eIF4E
and S6 phosphorylation, respectively. Furthermore, the
growth of BS125 cells in soft agar at increasing concentrations
of CGP57380 and rapamycin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, left). Concomitant treatment with
CGP57380 and rapamycin amplified inhibitory effect;
CGP57380 at 2 mmol/L significantly increased the growth
inhibition by rapamycin. To analyze the relationship specifically between MNK1 protein level and cell proliferation after
rapamycin treatment, RNAi (RNA interference) was used to

duplex siRNA were used specific for splice variants MNK1a
and MNK1b, which encode identical catalytic domains. BS125
cells transfected with an MNK1-specific siRNA duplex showed
significantly reduced endogenous expression of both phospho- and total MNK1 protein and enhanced sensitivity to
rapamycin (Fig. 2C). To investigate this further, a full-length
MNK1–Flag fusion protein was overexpressed in BS125 cells.
Ectopically expressed MNK1 protein was phosphorylated and
this reduced the inhibition of BS125 cell proliferation by
rapamycin (Fig. 2C, right). MNK1 overexpression increased
phosphorylation of the MNK1 substrate eIF4E more than 2fold, indicating that the MNK1-Flag–tagged kinase was fully
functional whereas MNK1-specific knockdown or CGP57380
treatment reduced eIF4E phosphorylation to 51% and 7%,
respectively, compared with control-treated cells (Fig. 2D).

significantly reduced the abundance of polysomes (0.43 
0.04) compared with control. Cotreatment with CGP57380 and
rapamycin both increased free ribosomes (1.48  0.23) and
reduced polysomes abundance (0.31  0.05). Furthermore, as
shown in Figure 3B and C, the inhibition of global translation
was accompanied by G1 cell-cycle arrest. This demonstrates a
major cytostatic effect in BS125 cells treated with CGP57380
together with rapamycin or RAD001.
Identification of MNK1-regulated targets
Sucrose gradient separation revealed no major differences
in polysome profiles between BS125 cells transfected with
siRNA against MNK1 and the control duplex (Fig. 4A and B),
suggesting that MNK1 is involved rather in the regulation of a
small subset of mRNAs. To investigate this further, total and
polysome-associated RNAs isolated from the same transfected
cells were compared using microarray hybridization. In addition to reduced MNK1 expression, we identified 56 differentially expressed mRNAs (P < 0.05) using polysomal RNA and 29
using total RNA (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Of
these, 5 targets were common to both polysomal and total
RNAs. The identified MNK1 targets have been subjected to
gene ontology and pathway analysis using the DAVID webbased bioinformatics tool (23, 24). These analyses indicated
that MNK1 regulates a group of mRNAs encoding proteins
involved in TGF-b signaling, with the highest enrichment
value of 8.3 whereas mRNAs associated with signal transduction and cell communication showed 3.1- and 2.6-fold enrichment, respectively (Table 1). Of note, the SMAD2 transcript
was present in all 3 identified gene groups, suggesting that
SMAD2 expression plays an important role in the MNK1regulated phenotype.

MNK1 regulates SMAD2-dependent TGF-b pathways in
human GBM
The microarray data demonstrating decreased SMAD2
mRNA association with polysomes (Fig. 5A) were further
validated by RT-PCR analysis of polysomal and total RNA
(Fig. 5B) or at the protein level in MNK1-depleted BS125 and
LN319 cells (Fig. 5C). SMAD2 protein was also reduced at the
presence of RNA polymerase II inhibitor, actinomycin D,
indicating posttranscriptional regulation. In addition, the
SMAD2 protein level was found to be higher in MNK1-overexpressing BS125 stable clones than in control-transfected
cells (Fig. 5C, bottom). To further validate the in vitro data,
tissue arrays were used to analyze MNK1 and SMAD2 expression at the protein level in 34 GBM tumors and 5 normal
brains, as described above. Strong MNK1 and SMAD2 immunostaining was recorded in comparable areas of analyzed
tumors, whereas normal brain tissue showed significantly
weaker expression (Fig. 5D). Comparative bioinformatics
analysis of MNK1 and SMAD2 expression gave a correlation
coefficient of 0.6, supporting our in vitro observation that
MNK1 regulates SMAD2 protein levels in human GBM.
Exploring how far MNK1 may be involved in the regulation
of TGF-b/SMAD–dependent phenotype, we found that TGF-b
at 5 nmol/L is sufficient to increase cell motility of BS125 and
Hs683 cells compared with untreated cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of MNK1 or inhibition by
CGP57380 reduced total as well as TGF-b–induced phosphorylated SMAD2 levels and led to a pronounced inhibition
of cellular motility (Fig. 6A). Bioinformatics analysis of microarray data from GBM patients revealed a significant correlation between MNK1 expression and TGF-b–regulated genes.
For this analysis, we chose hallmarks of the epithelial to

mesenchymal transition (EMT) that plays a crucial role in
malignant cancer cell migration and motility (25). Expression
of vimentin and fibronectin positively correlated with MNK1
expression levels (correlation coefficients ¼ 0.74 and 0.70,
respectively), whereas, E-cadherin and tight junction protein 1
showed negative correlations of 0.64 and 0.65, respectively
(Fig. 6B). Decreased vimentin expression was further confirmed at the protein level in MNK1-depleted BS125 GBM cells
(Fig. 6B) whereas E-cadherin expression was not detected by
Western blotting (data not shown). The lack of vimentin and
other TGF-b–regulated EMT markers among the MNK1-regulated mRNAs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) may be
explained by the fact that microarray analyses were performed
48 hours after transfection, which was sufficient for MNK1
knockdown at the protein level, whereas a significant decrease
in SMAD2 protein was only observed after 72 hours (Fig. 5C).
As only a marginal decrease in SMAD2 protein expression was
reached 48 hours after transfection, we concluded that a
significant decrease in SMAD2 protein synthesis begins after
that time point resulting in alterations in TGF-b/SMAD2
signaling pathways.
In this study, we showed that SMAD2 protein synthesis
depends on MNK1 and that targeting MNK1 sensitizes GBM
cells to rapamycin. Therefore, we asked whether inhibition of
the TGF-b/SMAD2 pathway, instead of MNK1, also has an
additive effect. For this, we made use of the SB431542 compound known to inhibit SMAD2 phosphorylation (26). As
demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S4, concomitant treatment with SB431542 and rapamycin (or RAD001) for 5 days
had an inhibitory effect on GBM cell growth (27%–30% of
control) similar to that in cells treated with CGP57380, rapamycin or RAD001 (20%–23%). Targeting all 3 pathways
(mTOR, SMAD2, and MNK1) did not increase the inhibitory
effect (20%–22%) and concomitant treatment with CGP57380
and SB431542 was not additive. Finally, as shown in
Figure 6C, TGF-b treatment induced activation of MNK1
upstream kinases p38 and ERK1/2, and increased MNK1

phosphorylation, thus supporting our model for MNK1 and
TGF-b/SMAD2 pathways convergence (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The biological function of eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209
by MNKs has long been controversial. Some studies have
reported that eIF4E phosphorylation enhances translation
in general (27), whereas others concluded that it has no effect
or even reduces translation (22, 28). Our analysis of polysome
profiles from MNK-depleted cells revealed that growth inhibition occurs as a result of reduced translation, arguing for
positive regulation of translation via the MNK/eIF4E pathway.
Although eIF4E is known to be a general translation factor, it
can also preferentially enhance the translation of carcinogenesis-associated mRNAs, including regulators of the cell cycle,
apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion (29–32). Therefore, it is
very likely that CGP57380-mediated reduction of translation
and G1 cell-cycle arrest results from inhibition of the selective
translation of MNK-regulated, growth-promoting transcripts.
Furthermore, analysis of polysomal profiles prepared from
MNK1-depleted glioblastoma cells indicated that MNK1 signaling is not required for global translation. As previously
reported, mice lacking both Mnk1 and Mnk2 develop normally
and eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209 does not occur, even
when MNK upstream kinases are activated (33). These results
demonstrate that MNK signaling is not crucial for normal
growth; although, MNK activity may be necessary for growth
and survival under certain conditions, for example particular
stresses or cancer states. Indeed, in the same model, loss of
MNK function sensitized mouse fibroblasts to apoptosis
induced by serum withdrawal suggesting a function in adaptive responses to stress (34). Similarly, arsenic-induced apoptosis was enhanced in cells with targeted disruption of MNK
genes (35). Thus, our results together with the previously
published data, promote elevated MNK activity in human
glioblastoma as an attractive therapeutic target for 2 reasons.
First, MNK signaling is not required for normal cell growth or
development. Second, its inhibition may neutralize the cellular
stress responses that aid cancer cell survival and are triggered
by many therapies.
The different degree of translation reduction in CGP57380treated cells compared with MNK1-specific knockdown (Figs.
3 and 4) may be explained by the fact that CGP57380 targets
all human MNKs and inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation almost
completely whereas MNK1 knockdown reduces the phosphorylated form of eIF4E by 50%, presumably due to an
MNK2 compensatory function. In our study, similar effects
were also observed in proliferation assays, where CGP57380
had a more dramatic effect on cell phenotype than a genetic
approach using MNK1-specific knockdown. We found MNK1,
but not MNK2, to be overexpressed in human gliomas.
Although the 2 kinases share eIF4E as a substrate, they exhibit
70% identity in their catalytic domains (36), potentially indicating regulation of different downstream pathways. An
MNK1-specific role that is not compensated by MNK2 has
already been proposed from the results of experiments in
which reintroduction of wild-type Mnk1, but not Mnk2,

LN319 whole cell protein lysates prepared 48 or 72 hours after transfection with duplex siRNA against MNK1 or with a control duplex against luciferase were
subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to total SMAD2, MNK1, and tubulin, as an equal loading control. In addition, 48 hours after
transfection, BS125 cells were further incubated with 1 mmol/L of actinomycin D for the next 24 hours and the protein lysates were analyzed as
described above. Bottom, SMAD2 and MNK1 expression analyzed by Western blotting in stable BS125 cell clones overexpressing the full-length

rescued the starvation-induced apoptotic phenotype of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts from mnk1/2 double-knockout animals
(34). Furthermore, in the most recent study, MNK1-specific
knockdown in U87MG cells was sufficient to reduce tumor
formation in mouse xenograft model (37) suggesting that
MNK1 plays an essential role in gliomagenesis. Therefore,
to investigate the role of MNK1 in regulation of gene expression, we used a genetic approach for specifically knocking
down MNK1 expression. Our microarray analysis detected 80
MNK1-dependent mRNAs, with 56 of them using polysomal
RNA, indicating that MNK1-dependent gene expression is
regulated mainly at the translational level. In a previous study,
translation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 was found to be

www.aacrjournals.org

regulated by eIF4E phosphorylation, thus supporting a role for
MNK1 signaling in lymphoma cell survival (14). A more recent
study using CGP57380 compound and an array of 263 prostate
carcinoma-related genes identified new translationally regulated MNK targets involved in the response to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1a) and cell-cycle regulation (cyclindependent kinases and inhibitors) in prostate cancer cells
(38). Our screen used a genetic approach together with a
genome-wide microarray to identify MNK1-specific–regulated
genes. The fact that this screen did not identify previously
described MNK targets may be due to GBM cell specificity. In
addition, by targeting MNK1 (but not MNK2 or eIF4E phosphorylation), we identified an MNK1-specific subset of mRNAs

Figure 6. MNK1 signaling regulated TGF-b–induced glioma cell motility. A, BS125 and Hs683 cells were transfected with duplex siRNA oligonucleotides
against the MNK1 gene (si) or luciferase (control). A scratch was made 48 hours after transfection or 24 hours after treatment with 10 mmol/L CGP57380 or
DMSO (control) and cellular motility was monitored in the presence of 5 nmol/L TGF-b. After 22 hours, the scratch "wound" recovery was
set to 100% in control cells. All experiments were assayed in triplicate and results shown as means  SD. Bottom, whole protein lysates isolated from
transfected and/or treated cells (as described above) were subjected to Western blot analysis using p-SMAD2 (Ser245/250/255), SMAD2, MNK1, and
tubulin antibodies. B, correlation coefficients of the comparison of MNK1 and EMT markers in 15 GBMs and 2 normal brain samples. VIM, vimentin;

indicated time points or for 24 hours. D, model for MNK1 and TGF-b pathway convergence. Overexpressed and activated MNK1 kinase increases SMAD2
translation thereby contributing to signaling of canonical (i) TGF-b pathways via SMAD2/3/4 complexes that interact with transcription factors (TF) and
induce expression of genes involved in proliferation, motility, and survival of malignant GBM cells. Hyperactivated TGF-b receptors (TbRI and TbRII) can also
activate noncanonical pathways (ii) leading to phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinases and activation of MNK1 that can further increase translation of
specific mRNAs involved in cancer progression.

that may be different to MNK2- or phospho-EIF4E–regulated
target gene groups.
Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of MNK1 reduced
total and phosphorylated SMAD2 levels as well as TGFb–associated cell motility of glioma cells indicating that
MNK1 regulates not only one of the main transducers of
TGF-b signals but also an TGF-b/SMAD2–dependent phenotype. The correlation between EMT markers and MNK1
expression in GBM patients, and the reduced vimentin
expression in MNK1-depleted GBM cells, suggest MNK1
regulation of TGF-b–induced gene expression. In addition,
the correlation found between MNK1 and SMAD2 protein

expression in human GBMs further supports our model in
GBM patients. SMAD2 is one of the major signal transducers
during TGF-b pathway activation. Previous studies showed
that high TGF-b/SMAD activity in human glioma patients
correlated with poor prognosis and was dependent on
platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFB) expression
(39) and a more recent report demonstrates that TGF-b
can induce the self-renewal capacity of glioma-initiating
cells in a SMAD-dependent manner (40). In our study,
MNK1 expression correlated with PDGFB in primary GBM
patients (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.56, data not shown)
and targeting MNKs reduced GBM-derived spheres growth

suggesting that MNK1 signaling supports TGF-b activity in
malignant gliomas.
In invasive cancers, TGF-b signaling has a tumor-promoting
effect supporting cell motility, invasion, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and EMT (41). Interestingly, noncanonical
TGF-b signaling pathways can activate ERKs and p38 kinases
(42) that phosphorylate and activate MNKs. In agreement with
previous study, TGF-b induced ERK and p38 activity as well as
MNK1 phosphorylation in GBM cells. Therefore, our data
together with previous observations propose a model whereby
activation of MNK1 and TGF-b pathways and their mutual
regulation support GBM progression (Fig. 6D).
A balance between MNK activity and mTOR pathways was
reported in prostate and lung cancer cells, where downregulation of one pathway was correlated with the activation of
another, resulting in a defined level of translation that supported cancer cell survival (38, 43). In agreement with a recent
study, simultaneous blocking of the MNK and mTOR pathways significantly blocked GBM cell proliferation, colony
formation, and tumor sphere growth. We observed a marked
additive effect on translation inhibition and G1 cell-cycle
arrest compared with the single treatment, thus also indicating a therapeutic potential of targeting MNK and mTOR

pathways against certain tumor entities including malignant
gliomas.
