Abstract

Author Manuscript

Mutation of the p53 gene is the most common genetic alteration in human cancer and contributes
to malignant process by enhancing transformed properties of cells and resistance to anticancer
therapy. Mutant p53 is often highly expressed in tumor cells at least in part due to its increased
half-life. However, whether mutant p53 expression is regulated by other mechanisms in tumors is
unclear. Here, we found that histone deacetylase inhibitors suppress both wild-type and mutant
p53 transcription in time- and dose-dependent manners. Consistent with this, the levels of wildtype and mutant p53 proteins are decreased upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Importantly,
we found that upon knockdown of each class I HDAC, only HDAC8 knockdown leads to
decreased expression of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins and transcripts. Conversely, we found
that ectopic expression of wild-type but not mutant HDAC8 leads to increased transcription of
p53. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of HDAC8 results in reduced expression of HoxA5
and consequently attenuated ability of HoxA5 to activate p53 transcription, which can be rescued
by ectopic expression of HoxA5. Due to the fact that HDAC8 is required for expression of both
wild-type and mutant p53, we found that targeted disruption of HDAC8 expression remarkably
triggers proliferative defect in cells with a mutant, but not wild-type, p53. Together, our data
uncover a regulatory mechanism of mutant p53 transcription via HDAC8 and suggest that HDAC
inhibitors and especially HDAC8-targeting agents might be explored as an adjuvant for tumors
carrying a mutant p53.

expression. To date, 18 HDACs have been characterized in humans and classified into four
groups based on homology to yeast HDACs. Class I HDACs consist of HDAC1-3 and 8.
Class II HDACs consist of HDAC4-7 and 9–10. Class I–II HDACs are zinc-dependent
enzymes. Class III HDACs, also called sirtuins 1–7, have an enzymatic activity that requires
NAD+ and are insensitive to HDAC inhibitors of hydroxamic acid derivative, such as
vorinostat (SAHA) which potently inhibits class I–II HDACs (1). Class IV HDAC has one
member, HDAC11, which shares a conserved catalytic core with class I–II HDACs.

Aberrant expression of HDACs has been detected in various tumors. For example, HDAC1
is found to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (2) whereas HDAC2 overexpressed in gastric
carcinomas, colorectal carcinomas, cervical dysplasias and endometrial stromal sarcomas
(3–5). HDAC8 is found to be overexpressed in multiple tumors, especially neuroblastoma
and glioma (6). It is well-characterized that overexpression of HDAC1-3 decreases, whereas
knockdown of HDAC1-3 increases, p21 expression (3–5, 7). As a key cell cycle regulator,
increased expression of p21 leads to tumor suppression. Thus, targeting HDACs is an ideal
strategy for tumors addicted to HDACs. Indeed, HDAC inhibitors have been approved for
treating cutaneous T cell lymphoma (8) and currently are being tested in phase I–II trials for
advanced solid malignancies (9), hormone therapy-resistant breast cancer (10), and nonHodgkin’s lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma (11).

HDAC8 is a unique member of class I HDACs since it lacks the conserved C-terminal
domain (12). The C-terminal domain in HDAC1-3 is necessary for interacting with other
proteins and for cellular localization (13) and posttranslational modifications (14, 15). In
addition, HDAC8 is found to be regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) whereas HDAC1-2
regulated by casein kinase-2 (16, 17). Furthermore, the expression profile of HDAC8 is
distinct from that for other class I HDACs. HDAC8 is highly expressed in brain, kidney and
prostate whereas HDAC1-3 are highly expressed in heart and placenta (6, 18). The
difference might imply a distinct biological function for HDAC8. In neuroblastoma,
HDAC8 is the only one that shows significant correlation with advanced disease stage (19).
Knockdown of HDAC8 in cultured neuroblastoma cells results in inhibition of proliferation,
reduced clonogenic growth, and cell cycle arrest (19). Interestingly, knockdown of HDAC8
has no effect on histone acetylation (19) although class I HDAC1-3 are potently regulators
of histone acetylation. In addition, HDAC8-specific inhibitors induce a unique pattern of
hyperacetylated proteins compared with the pan-HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A in human
cells (20).

How p53 is regulated has been subject to intense scrutiny, including transcriptional
regulation. The majority of transcriptional regulatory elements in the p53 promoter are
found within the region upstream the transcription initiation site, including HoxA5 and p53
(21). Indeed, HoxA5 was found to increase p53 expression by binding to consensus Hoxbinding sites in the p53 promoter (22). p53 activates its own expression through direct
binding to a p53-responsive element in the p53 promoter under physiologic conditions or in
response to cellular stress (23). However, whether mutant p53 is regulated is underexplored
simply due to the perception that mutant p53 protein is hyper-stable. In fact, recent evidence
suggests that mutant p53 protein is unstable and subject to polyubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation (24). Thus, it is important to understand whether transcriptional

regulation plays a role in mutant p53 expression. In this study, we analyzed mutant p53
transcription in tumor cells with HDAC inhibitors or specific knockdown of an individual
HDAC. We found that HDAC8 is necessary for p53 transcription via HoxA5 transcription
factor. Our study indicates that the use of HDAC inhibitors as a cancer therapeutic agent
should be approached with caution since the status of the p53 gene may dictate the response
of tumors to HDAC inhibitors alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.

Non-histone targets of HDACs include transcription factors and other signaling proteins
(25), some of which are involved in cancer development and progression. The tumor
suppressor p53 is the first non-histone target for acetylation and deacetylation. HDACs can
deacetylate p53 and affect its transcriptional activity (26–28). Knockdown of HDAC2 was
found to alter p53 DNA-binding activity but not p53 expression or posttranslational
modifications (29). A recent study showed that in tumor cells harboring a mutant p53,
SAHA treatment can destabilize mutant p53 protein via inhibition of the HDAC6-HSP90
chaperone pathway (30). In this study, we explored transcriptional regulation of the p53
gene by HDACs. To confirm that mutant p53 expression can be decreased by pan-HDAC
inhibitors, HaCaT and SW480 cells were treated with SAHA and sodium butyrate (NaB).
We found that upon treatment of 2 µM SAHA, the level of mutant p53 protein was
decreased in a time-dependent manner in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1A, left panel) and in SW480
cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). It is well-known that p21 is transcriptionally upregulated by
HDAC inhibitors (31). Thus, the level of p21 protein was examined as a positive control. As
expected, p21 expression in both cell lines was increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
1A). Consistent with SAHA treatment, the levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 were
significantly increased (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we found that upon exposure to 4 mM NaB,
the level of mutant p53 protein was decreased in HaCaT and SW480 cells whereas the level
of p21 protein and acetylated histones H3 and H4 were increased (Fig. 1B).

Author Manuscript

Next, we determined how much SAHA is required for inhibiting mutant p53 expression. To
test this, HaCaT and SW480 cells were treated with various doses of SAHA for 24 h (Fig.
1C). We found that the level of mutant p53 protein in HaCaT cells was decreased by SAHA
at a dose of as low as 0.25 µM (Fig. 1C, left panel). As the concentration was increased to
0.5–4 µM, SAHA further decreased the level of mutant p53 in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1C, left
panel). Similarly, the levels of p21 protein and acetylated histones H3 and H4 were also
increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, left panel). Consistent with the observations
in HaCaT cells, the level of mutant p53 protein in SW480 cells was also decreased by
SAHA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, right panel). Thus, in cultured solid tumor
cells, the dose of SAHA (0.25 to 4 µM), which efficiently suppresses mutant p53 expression,
is within the range of the clinically relevant plasma peak level of 1.7 µM in advanced
leukemia patients treated with 400 mg of SAHA daily (9). Similarly, we found that upon
exposure to NaB for 24 h, the level of mutant p53 protein was decreased in HaCaT and
SW480 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D).

HDAC inhibitors decrease the level of both mature and precursor mRNAs of mutant p53 in
time- and dose-dependent manners
To examine whether p53 transcription is suppressed by HDAC inhibitors, RT-PCR was
performed to measure the level of mutant p53 transcript in HaCaT and SW480 cells, which
were untreated or treated with 2 µM SAHA or 4 mM NaB. Actin mRNA was measured as a
control. We found that the level of mutant p53 mRNA in HaCaT and SW480 cells was
reduced in a time-dependent manner by SAHA (Fig. 2A) and NaB (Fig. 2B). We also found
that the level of mutant p53 mRNA in HaCaT and SW480 cells was reduced in a dosedependent manner by SAHA (Fig. 2C) and NaB (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the decrease in the
level of mutant p53 mRNA is likely responsible for the decrease in the level of mutant p53
protein.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the level of mutant p53 mRNA is regulated at the transcriptional or
post-transcriptional level by pan-HDAC inhibitors, we measured the level of the precursor
mRNAs of p53, p21 and GAPDH with a specific set of primers (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, we
found that the level of precursor mutant p53 mRNA in HaCaT and SW480 cells was
markedly decreased in a time-dependent manner by SAHA (Fig. 2F) or NaB (Fig. 2G). We
also found that upon exposure to SAHA (Fig. 2H) or NaB (Fig. 2I) for 24 h, the level of
precursor mutant p53 mRNA was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, the
level of precursor p21 mRNA was rapidly increased at 8 h upon treatment with SAHA or
NaB (Fig. 2F–I), but then slightly decreased at 16 h, which is consistent with previous report
(31). We would like to note that the long-term treatment with a high dose of NaB slightly
decreased the level of precursor p21 mRNA in SW480 cells (Fig. 2I, left panel), which
might be due to the cellular toxicity of NaB. Taken together, these findings suggested that
mutant p53 expression is likely to be inhibited at the transcription level by HDAC inhibitors.

Knockdown of HDAC8 decreases the level of mutant p53 protein and transcript

Author Manuscript

SAHA is a potent inhibitor of HDAC1-4 and 6–9 (32–34) whereas NaB inhibits most class
I–II HDACs except HDAC6 and 10 (35, 36). Based on selective inhibition of HDACs by
SAHA and NaB and cellular distribution of HDACs, it is likely that inhibition of HDAC1-3
and 8 is responsible for the decreased transcription of mutant p53. Since pharmacological
inhibitors, including HDAC inhibitors, inherently possess non-specific or off-target effects,
knockdown of an individual HDAC by siRNA was performed to identify a HDAC
responsible for regulating mutant p53 transcription. We found that the level of HDAC1- 3
and 8 proteins in SW480 cells was significantly decreased by their respective siRNA but not
scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3A, HDAC panels). Interestingly, we found that the level of mutant
p53 protein was decreased only by HDAC8 knockdown (Fig. 3A, p53 panel). Similarly, we
found that in HaCaT cells, the level of mutant p53 protein was decreased by knockdown of
HDAC8 but not HDAC1-3 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we found that knockdown of HDAC8
led to decreased expression of mutant p53 in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 3C).
Next, we examined whether knockdown of HDAC8 has an effect on mutant p53
transcription. We found that upon knockdown of HDAC8 in SW480, HaCaT, and MIA
PaCa-2 cells, the level of mutant p53 mRNA was significantly decreased (Fig. 3D). To
confirm the effect of HDAC8 knockdown on p53 transcription, the level of precursor mutant

p53 transcript along with precursor GAPDH mRNA was measured. Again, we found that the
level of precursor mRNA for mutant p53 was decreased by HDAC8 knockdown (Fig. 3E).
To rule out the possibility that decreased expression of mutant p53 protein is through a posttranslational mechanism, MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 µg/ml) in
the absence or presence of HDAC8 knockdown for 0–8 h. The relative levels of mutant p53
protein were quantified by Western blotting and normalized by levels of actin protein, which
were then plotted versus time (h) to calculate the half-life of mutant p53. We found that the
half-life for mutant p53 protein was about 6.5 h regardless of HDAC8 knockdown (Fig. 3F
and G). This result suggests that HDAC8 knockdown does not target the stability of mutant
p53 protein but rather inhibits mutant p53 transcription.

Author Manuscript

It is known that SAHA induces the degradation of mutant p53 protein via inhibiting
HDAC6, a member of class IIb HDACs (30). However, it is still unclear whether HDAC6
regulates mutant p53 transcription. To rule out this possibility, SW480 cells were transfected
with scrambled siRNA or siRNA against HDAC6. We found that HDAC6 knockdown
decreased the level of mutant p53 protein (Fig. 3H), consistent with the previous report (30).
However, the effect of HDAC6 knockdown on the expression of mutant p53 protein was
weaker than that of HDAC8 knockdown (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, we found that knockdown
of HDAC6 had little if any effect on the level of mutant p53 mRNA (Fig. 3I). Thus, our data
suggest that HDAC8 but not HDAC6 is required for mutant p53 transcription.
HDAC inhibitors and knockdown of HDAC8 decrease the level of wild-type p53 protein and
transcript

Author Manuscript

Since mutations of the p53 gene in SW480, HaCaT, and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines are located
in the coding region but not the promoter region, it is possible that HDACs may regulate
wild-type p53 expression via the same mechanism. To test this, HCT116 cells, which carry a
wild-type p53, were treated with 2 µM SAHA or 4 mM NaB for 24h. We found that SAHA
or NaB, alone or in combination with camptothecin (CPT) treatment, inhibited accumulation
of wild-type p53 protein in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with an early
observation in that HDAC inhibitors can suppress cisplatin-induced p53 expression in rat
kidney proximal tubular cell line (37). Next, we examined the effect of SAHA or NaB on
wild-type p53 transcription. We found that SAHA or NaB, alone or in combination with
CPT treatment, decreased the level of both mature and precursor transcripts of wild-type p53
in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4B and C).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether HDAC8 is responsible for HDAC inhibitors to suppress wild-type
p53 transcription, HDAC8 was knocked down in HCT116 cells. We found that the levels of
wild-type p53 protein (Fig. 4D), mature and precursor transcripts (Fig.4E) were decreased
by HDAC8 knockdown. Together, these data indicate that HDAC8 transcriptionally
regulates p53 expression regardless of the mutation status of the p53 gene.
Ectopic expression of HDAC8 increases mutant p53 expression
To demonstrate the effect of HDAC8 on mutant p53 expression, we examined whether
ectopic expression of HDAC8 can alter mutant p53 expression in tumor cells. It has been
reported that residues D101 and Y306 in HDAC8 are crucial for HDAC8 activity (38, 39).

Thus, mutant HDAC8-D101A, -Y306F, and -D101A/Y306F, which carry one or both
mutations in these two critical residues, were generated. We found that the level of mutant
p53 protein was markedly increased by wild-type HDAC8 but not mutant D101A, Y306F,
and D101A/Y306F in SW480 and HaCaT cells (Fig. 5A–B). In addition, the level of
precursor mutant p53 transcript was increased upon ectopic expression of wild-type but not
mutant HDAC8 (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that HDAC8 activity is required for p53
transcription.
HDAC8 knockdown inhibits the ability of HoxA5 to activate the p53 promoter via
decreasing HoxA5 expression

Author Manuscript

HoxA5 is a well-defined activator of p53 transcription (21). Thus, ChIP assay was
performed to examine the binding of HoxA5 to the p53 promoter in cells with or without
knockdown of HDAC8 (Fig. 6A). We found that while HoxA5 bound to the p53 promoter,
knockdown of HDAC8 in SW480 cells markedly decreased the extent of HoxA5 associated
with the p53 promoter (Fig. 6B, p53 panels). Similarly, we found that knockdown of
HDAC8 obviously decreased the extent of HoxA5 binding to the promoter of PTN (Fig. 6B,
PTN panels), a known transcriptional target of HoxA5 (40). As a negative control, HoxA5
was not found to associate with the GAPDH promoter (Fig. 6B, GAPDH panels). Next, we
examined whether HDAC8 has an effect on HoxA5 to regulate the p53 promoter by
luciferase assay. Consistent with a previous report (22), HoxA5 increased luciferase
expression under the control of the p53 promoter with a consensus HoxA5-binding site but
not a mutated one (Fig. 6C–D). In contrast, knockdown of HDAC8 attenuated the ability of
endogenous HoxA5 to activate the p53 promoter (Fig. 6E).

Author Manuscript

Next, to explore how HDAC8 knockdown inhibited the ability of HoxA5 to activate the p53
promoter, the level of HoxA5 protein was measured in cells with or without HDAC8
knockdown. We found that knockdown of HDAC8 obviously decreased the expression of
HoxA5 protein and mRNA in SW480, HaCaT and HCT116 cells (Fig. 7A–B, HoxA5
panels). These data suggest that the inhibition of HDAC8 knockdown on p53 transcription is
at least in part via decreasing the expression of HoxA5.
Ectopic expression of HoxA5 restores p53 expression in HDAC8-knockdown cells

Author Manuscript

Since decreased expression of p53 by HDAC8 knockdown is possibly mediated by HoxA5,
we examined whether ectopic expression of HoxA5 is sufficient to restore mutant p53
expression in HDAC8-knockdown cells. First, we found that upon ectopic expression of
HoxA5, the level of mutant p53 in SW480 and HaCaT cells and wild-type p53 in HCT116
cells was increased (Fig. 8A–C, compare lanes 1–2), consistent with the data above that
HoxA5 is a potent transcription activator of the p53 promoter. Next, we showed that
knockdown of HDAC8 led to decreased expression of both mutant and wild-type p53 (Fig
8A–C, compare lane 1 with 3), consistent with the observations above (Figs. 3–4).
Interestingly, we found that ectopic expression of HoxA5 markedly decreased the effect of
HDAC8 knockdown on mutant and wild-type p53 expression (Fig. 8A–C, compare lanes 3–
4). It should be noted that the level of HDAC8 protein was not significantly altered by
ectopic expression of HoxA5 (Fig. 8A–B, compare lanes 1 and 3 with 2 and 4, respectively).

Targeted disruption of HDAC8 expression triggers proliferative defect in cells carrying a
mutant p53
Since mutant p53 has been implicated in promoting cell survival (41, 42) and knockdown of
HDAC8 leads to decreased expression of mutant p53, we tested whether knockdown of
HDAC8 is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of cells containing a mutant p53. For this
purpose, colony formation assays were performed with SW480, HaCaT, and MIA PaCa-2
cell lines, in which scrambled siRNA or siRNA against HDAC8 was transfected. We found
that knockdown of HDAC8 significantly inhibited the proliferation of cells with a mutant
p53 (Fig. 9A–B). Interestingly, we found that compared to mutant p53 cell lines, wild-type
p53 cell line HCT116 was less sensitive to knockdown of HDAC8 (Fig. 9A–B). Together,
these results suggest that the effect of HDAC8 knockdown on cell proliferation might be
dependent on the status of the p53 gene in cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

HDAC inhibitors have been shown to induce growth suppression via increased apoptosis
and decreased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo (32, 43, 44). In addition, many studies
reported that HDAC inhibitors preferentially regulate expression of genes involved in cell
survival and cell death (45–51). In this study, we examined the effect of SAHA and NaB on
mutant p53 expression in tumor cells. We found that in SW480 and HaCaT cell lines,
HDAC inhibitors decrease the level of mutant p53 protein and mRNA in time- and dosedependent manners. The inhibition apparently occurs at the level of transcription because
precursor p53 transcript is consistently decreased by HDAC inhibitors. In addition, we
found that ectopic expression of HDAC8 increases, whereas knockdown of HDAC8
decreases, the level of mutant p53 protein and transcript. Similarly, we observed that the
levels of wild-type p53 protein and transcripts are decreased by HDAC inhibitors or HDAC8
knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of HDAC8 decreases the
expression of HoxA5 and consequently attenuates the ability of HoxA5 to activate the p53
promoter, whereas ectopic expression of HoxA5 is able to restore p53 expression in
HDAC8-knockdown cells. Together, our data provide evidence that HDAC inhibitors
decreases p53 transcription via HDAC8 and HoxA5.

Author Manuscript

In this study, although the expression of mutant p53 was found to be transcriptionally
regulated by HDAC8 via HoxA5, we are still challenged with unresolved questions, such as
whether HoxA5 is a direct target of HDAC8 and then how HDAC8 regulates the expression
of HoxA5. In contrast to class I HDAC-selective inhibitors, HDAC8-selective inhibitor do
not alter histone acetylation (19, 52). In line with this, knockdown of HDAC8 has no effect
on histone acetylation (19). Therefore, HDAC8 may not act via global changes of histone
acetylation, but rather act specifically at certain promoter sites, one of which may be the
HoxA5 gene. Thus, the future studies are warranted to explore whether HDAC8 regulates
the acetylation level of histone at the site of the HoxA5 promoter or the gene itself.
The promising use of pan-HDAC inhibitors to treat cancer in the clinic is exciting (8–11).
However, considering the function of HDACs and pleiotropic effects of pan-HDAC
inhibitors, the application of HDAC inhibitors in the clinic should be approached with
caution. In this study, we found that SAHA and NaB clearly decrease the basal level and

DNA damage-induced stabilization of wild-type p53 protein in tumor cells. Furthermore,
knockdown of HDAC8 leads to the decreased level of wild-type p53 protein, and mature and
precursor transcripts. It's worth noting that targeted disruption of HDAC8 expression
triggers proliferative defect in cells with a mutant, but not wild-type, p53. Therefore, an
effective personalized cancer therapy by HDAC inhibitors requires not only a thorough
understanding of the mechanism of action for HDACs and their inhibitors but also a
thoughtful consideration of genetic and epigenetic alterations for each individual cancer,
such as the status of the p53 gene. Otherwise, the use of HDAC inhibitors with an agent that
can activate wild-type p53 for cancer therapy may actually cause antagonistic or adverse
effects rather than increase the efficacy against tumors with wild-type p53. Nevertheless, we
would like to emphasize that due to the high frequency of p53 mutation and the requirement
of HDAC8 for mutant p53 transcription, HDAC inhibitors and especially HDAC8-targeting
agents might be explored as an adjuvant for tumors carrying a mutant p53.

To generate a luciferase reporter under the control of the p53 promoter with a HoxA5

To measure precursor p53 mRNA, RT-PCR was performed with forward primer 5`GGAAGTCCCTCTCTGATTGTC-3` and reverse primer 5`CTCGACGCTAGGATCTGACT-3`. precursor p21 mRNA was amplified with forward
primer 5`-GACACTCCATAATACCCCTC-3`and reverse primer 5`CATCTTCTGCCTTAGTCTCAG-3`. Precursor GAPDH mRNA was amplified with
forward primer 5`-GGACTGGCTTTCCCATAATTTC-3`and reverse primer 5`AAGGTCATCCCTGAGCTGAAC-3`.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Author Manuscript

ChIP was performed as previously described (53, 54). SW480 cells, transfected with
scrambled siRNA or HDAC8 specific siRNA for 72 h, were cross-linked by 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclear extracts were prepared and
chromatin was sonicated to generate 200-to 1000-bp DNA fragments. Protein-DNA
complexes were immunoprecipitated with HoxA5 antibody and control IgG. The DNAprotein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65°C for 4 h. After phenol and chloroform
extraction, DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. To amplify the region from nt −200
to +11 in the p53 promoter, PCR was performed with forward primer 5`CAGGTCGGCGAGAATCCTG-3` and reverse primer 5’TGGCTCTAGACTTTTGAGAAGC-3’. A region in the PTN promoter was amplified to
serve as a positive control with forward primer 5`-TTTGCACTCATCTGAAGAATAG-3`
and reverse primer 5`-CTTTGCACTCGAGAGCTGAT-3`. A region in the GAPDH
promoter was amplified to serve as a negative control with forward primer 5`AAAAGCGGGGAGAAAGTAGG-3` and reverse primer 5`AAGAAGATGCGGCTGACTGT-3`.
Luciferase Assay

Author Manuscript

A dual luciferase assay was performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, 0.25 µg of a luciferase reporter, 0.25 µg
of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-HoxA5 that expresses HoxA5 protein, and 3 ng of Renilla
luciferase assay vector pRL-CMV were cotransfected into H1299 cells. The fold increase in
relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by HoxA5 divided
by that induced by an empty pcDNA3 vector. For luciferase assay with HDAC8 knockdown,
0.25 µg of a luciferase reporter, 0.32 µg of scrambled siRNA or siRNA against HDAC8, and
3 ng of Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL-CMV were cotransfected into SW480 cells. The
fold change in relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by
siRNA against HDAC8 divided by that induced by scrambled siRNA.

bands was calculated after normalized by levels of actin protein. (B) The experiment was
performed as in (A) except that HaCaT cells were used. (C) RT-PCR was performed with
total RNAs isolated from SW480 cells treated as in (A). Mature mRNA of HDAC8 and

Fig. 6. HDAC8 knockdown inhibits the ability of HoxA5 to activate the p53 promoter

Author Manuscript

(A) Schematic presentation of the HoxA5 (left), PTN (middle), and GAPDH (right)
promoters and the location of PCR primers used for ChIP assay. (B) HDAC8 knockdown
inhibits the binding of HoxA5 to the p53 promoter. SW480 cells were transfected with
scrambled siRNA or siRNA against HDAC8 for 3 d, and then HoxA5-DNA complexes were
captured with anti-HoxA5 along with rabbit IgG as a control. The binding of HoxA5 protein
to PTN or GAPDH promoter was measured as a positive or negative control. (C) Schematic
presentation of luciferase reporter constructs including the location of a HoxA5 binding site
in the p53 promoter. The reporter construct mu-p53-135 carries two nucleotide substitutions
in which TT were substituted with GG. (D) Wild-type but not mutant HoxA5-binding site in
the p53 promoter is responsive to HoxA5. The dual luciferase assay was performed as
described in the Materials and Methods. (E) HDAC8 knockdown inhibits the luciferase
activity under the control of the p53 promoter with wild-type but not mutant HoxA5-binding
site. The experiment was performed as in (D) except that siRNA against HDAC8 or a
scrambled siRNA was co-transfected with a luciferase reporter.

Fig. 8. Ectopic expression of HoxA5 restores p53 expression in HDAC8-knockdown cells

(A) Western blots were prepared with extracts from SW480 cells which were transfected
with scrambled siRNA or siRNA against HDAC8 along with or without overexpression of
HoxA5 for 3 d. The blots were probed with antibodies against HoxA5, HDAC8, p53 and
GAPDH, respectively. (B–C) The experiments were performed as in (A), except that HaCaT
(B) and HCT116 (C) cells were used.
