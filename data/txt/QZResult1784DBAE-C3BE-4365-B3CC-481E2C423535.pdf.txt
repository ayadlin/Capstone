many of these factors remain outside of clinician and
patient control, submission dates may be something we
can and should positively influence.

In response to our article,1 Wilson et al have highlighted
some compelling points. International variability in regulatory drug approval timelines is a global issue, exemplified by the 2-year difference in the regulatory approval
dates for crizotinib between the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and Australia.
Our study found a median 3-month difference in
the time required from submission to drug approval by
Health Canada (HC) compared with the FDA (9 months
vs 12 months; P<.0006), and incorporated differences in
submission times (Fig. 1). Submission to the FDA
occurred before that to the HC for 87% of new oncology
drug indications. The median time from FDA submission
to HC submission was 3.7 months. Regulatory review
time was approximately 4 months longer for HC compared with the FDA, regardless of the timing of the

submission (Table 1). Therefore, delays in approval
between the FDA and HC include discrepancies in both
submission dates and the length of regulatory review time.
We concur with Wilson et al that streamlining the
drug approval process by centralizing drug submission across
multiple regulatory agencies is an ideal starting point in alleviating delays in drug approval. This mechanism could
potentially be empowered to add international consistency
to drug approval indications. Hopefully, the cost of a centralized submission would be made reasonable for smaller drug
companies. In the interim, encouraging larger drug companies to submit simultaneously to multiple regulatory agencies
and decreasing regulatory review times are potential ways to
accelerate access to new oncology therapies for our patients.

Investigating the Relationship
Between Vitamin D and Cancer
Requires Dosing the Bioavailable
Nonhydroxylated Vitamin D
Storage in Cancer Tissues
In a recent article published in Cancer, Shui et al observed
no statistically significant relationship between circulating
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and fatal prostate can3362

cer (PCa).1 However, an association between cytochrome
P450 2R1 (CYP2R1) single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and fatal PCa was found.1 CYP2R1 is the hydroxylase involved in the conversion of vitamin D into
25(OH)D. In the classic vitamin D endocrine system, the
activation of vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D requires 2 successive hydroxylation steps. The first is catalyzed by
CYP2R1 in the liver and the second by CYP27B1 in the
kidneys. Then, 1,25D is released in the blood circulation
and behaves as an endocrine hormone. The conversion of
25(OH)D into the active hormone 1,25(OH)2D by
CYP27B1 is under stringent control. However, the first
hydroxylation step catalyzed in the liver by CYP2R1 is
constitutive and is not believed to be subjected to tight
regulation. This has 2 important consequences: 1) the
regulation of liver CYP2R1 has retained little attention;
and 2) circulating nonhydroxylated vitamin D is rapidly
metabolized by liver CYP2R1. Therefore, 25(OH)D
concentrations are considered to reflect vitamin D inputs
and are used to determine the vitamin D status of the
patient.
A major breakthrough in our understanding of the
nonskeletal effects of vitamin D is the recent discovery of
autocrine/paracrine vitamin D systems in many tissues.2
This autocrine/paracrine signaling ensures the local bioactivation of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D by extrarenal
CYP27B1. In autocrine/paracrine vitamin D systems,
the vitamin D metabolites are produced, act, and are
degraded locally without affecting serum 25(OH)D
levels. Shui et al rightly pointed out that local synthesis
of 1,25(OH)2D from 25(OH)D can occur because
CYP27B1 is expressed in the prostate. However, the
authors do not mention that CYP2R1 is also expressed in
prostate tissue.3 The fact that the prostate can also
perform the conversion of vitamin D into 25(OH)D is
critical. The activity of prostate CYP2R1 depends on the
local bioavailability of its substrate, namely nonhydroxylated vitamin D. There is very little circulating nonhydroxylated vitamin D in the body, but storage can occur.
This requires large inputs and is mainly observed in fat
tissues when circulating 25(OH)D concentrations exceed
90 nmol/L.4 This value is higher than the defined
physiological levels for 25(OH)D sufficiency (50 nmol/
L-75 nmol/L), but is consistent with 25(OH)D concentrations suggested to reduce cancer risk (approximately
150 nmol/L).5 The existence of a functional vitamin D
autocrine/paracrine system in the prostate that depends
on the local bioavailability of nonhydroxylated vitamin D
explains the findings reported by Shui et al1: 1) the lack
of a significant association between circulating 25(OH)D
