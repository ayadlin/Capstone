Introduction

HHMI Author Manuscript

Sixteen years ago in back-to-back papers in Cell, Ambros, Ruvkun and their colleagues
reported that a small RNA encoded by the lin-4 locus was capable of controlling the
developmental timing of the nematode C. elegans by modulating the expression of a proteincoding gene lin-14 (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993). At the time few would have
imagined that this discovery marked the birth of a new and far-reaching field of research.
Indeed, it took several more years to appreciate that small RNAs like lin-4 (now termed
microRNAs or miRNAs) were not just an interesting peculiarity of the nematode but were
an abundant (and pervasive) feature of all bilateria, including Homo sapiens (reviewed in
Bartel, 2004).

Over the past few years, biochemical and genetic studies have begun to reveal the
physiological functions of individual miRNAs. miRNAs act by modulating the expression of
target genes via sequence complementarity between the so-called “seed” sequence of the
miRNA and the “seed-match” present in the mRNA. Such binding inhibits the translation
and reduces the stability of the target mRNA, leading to decreased expression of the target
protein (reviewed in Eulalio et al., 2008)). miRNAs have been shown to control a wide array
of biological processes, including differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. As the
deregulation of these very same processes are hallmarks of cancer, it has been speculated for
some time that mutations affecting miRNAs and/or their functional interaction with
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes might also participate to tumorigenesis. Moreover,
because miRNAs can coordinately target multiple mRNAs, they could influence the activity
of numerous proteins (for example, in a particular pathway) and exert more extensive
effects.
In this review, we summarize recent findings that now overwhelmingly support an important
role for these tiny RNAs in controlling cell transformation and tumor progression as well as
the critical questions that remain to be answered.

A plethora of possible oncogenic mechanisms
Because miRNAs act by repressing gene expression through direct base-pairing interactions
with their target mRNAs, there are several possible mechanisms through which miRNAs
could affect tumorigenesis. Overexpression, amplification or loss of epigenetic silencing of a
gene encoding a miRNA that targets a (or multiple) tumor suppressor gene(s) could inhibit

the activity of an anti-oncogenic pathway. By contrast, the physical deletion or epigenetic
silencing of a miRNA that normally functions to repress expression of one or more
oncogenes might lead to increased protein expression and gain of oncogenic potency. More
subtle miRNA mutations could reduce or eliminate binding to key targets or even create
seed sequences to target a new set of mRNAs, thereby altering the balance of critical growth
regulatory proteins. Seed-match sequences of target mRNAs could also be the sites of
mutation, rendering them free from the repression of a given miRNA or subject to the
effects of another (Table 1).
Although not all of these potential mechanisms have been as yet documented in human
cancers, over the past half-dozen years a veritable flood of reports have linked miRNAs to
tumor development in one fashion or another. These range from genomic and gene
expression alterations affecting miRNA genes in human cancers to observations in
genetically-engineered mouse models of the disease. Taken together, the available data
provide a compelling case that alterations in miRNA-mRNA regulation can promote tumor
development.

HHMI Author Manuscript

As is true for protein-coding genes associated with cancer, the most convincing evidence
linking miRNAs to tumorigenesis comes from genetic alterations in cancer cells. Beginning
with the work of Croce and colleagues in 2002 (Calin et al., 2002), who showed that a pair
of neighboring miRNAs are frequently focally deleted in human chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL; see below), there are now several examples in which miRNA genes are
either lost or amplified in tumors (Reviewed in Calin and Croce, 2006). Moreover, miRNA
expression profiling studies comparing cancer tissue to normal tissue have revealed
provocative patterns of miRNA expression, some of which have been linked to changes in
methylation status of the miRNA genes (Reviewed in Saito and Jones, 2006). Functional
studies performed in cancer cell lines or mouse models of the disease have provided further
support for a direct role of a subset of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis. Similar to the
miRNA field as a whole, the discovery of the physiologically relevant targets of these
cancer-associated miRNAs is still lagging, but here, too, there has been recent progress with
interesting candidate targets emerging.

miRNAs as Oncogenes

HHMI Author Manuscript

miRNAs that are amplified or over-expressed in cancer could function as oncogenes, and a
number of putative oncogenic miRNAs have been proposed. An interesting case is
represented by miR-155, which has been found to be upregulated in several hematopoietic
malignancies and tumors of the breast, lung and pancreas (Eis et al., 2005; Kluiver et al.,
2005; Metzler et al., 2004). The gene encoding the primary transcript for miR-155 had been
identified well before the discovery of miRNAs, as a common proviral DNA insertion site in
lymphomas induced by the avian leucosis virus (Clurman and Hayward, 1989). The absence
of an obvious open reading frame remained a puzzling feature of the BIC oncogene (as it
was initially named) even after it was shown that it could cooperate with Myc in
lymphomagenesis and erythroleukemogenesis (Tam et al., 2002). While the observation that
the BIC RNA could form extensive secondary structures (including a 145 bp stem-loop that
we now know is the precursor to miR-155) suggested that the RNA itself could be the
oncogenic factor (Tam, 2001; Tam et al., 1997), its mechanism of action remained unclear
until the identification of miR-155. The study of genetically-engineered mice with gain- and
loss-of-function alleles of miR-155 has provided valuable insights into its physiologic and
oncogenic properties. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in the B cells of transgenic mice is
sufficient to induce polyclonal proliferation of pre-B cells, followed by full blown B cell
leukemia (Costinean et al., 2006), although the mRNA targets of miR-155 are still unknown.
As for the normal functions of miR-155, the characterization of miR-155 knock-out mice

indicates that this miRNA is involved in the maturation of B cells in the germinal centers
(Rodriguez et al., 2007; Thai et al., 2007; Vigorito et al., 2007). Indeed, a rapid and intense
induction of miR-155 is observed in germinal center B cells after antigen stimulation, and in
miR-155 mutant mice, immunoglobulin isotype switching in response to T-dependent and Tindependent antigens is impaired. Several targets have been proposed to be important
mediators of miR-155 function in B cells, including the transcription factor Pu.1 (Vigorito et
al., 2007) and the activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (Dorsett et al., 2008; Teng et
al., 2008). In an elegant set of genetic experiments in mice, two groups have shown that
mutating a single recognition site for miR-155 in the 3-UTR of AID can partially phenocopy
the consequences of miR-155 deletion (Dorsett et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2008).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Another notable member of the family of oncogenic miRNAs is the miR-17~92 cluster. This
cluster, which consists of six miRNAs that are processed from a single primary transcript,
was initially linked to human cancer based on the observation that it maps to a chromosomal
region that is frequently amplified in a subset of human B cell lymphomas (Ota et al., 2004).
miR-17~92 is also frequently over-expressed in several other human cancers, including lung
cancers (Hayashita et al., 2005), hepatocarcinomas (Connolly et al., 2008), neuroblastomas
(Schulte et al., 2008), and colorectal cancers (He et al., 2005). In an important in vivo test of
the oncogenic potential of miR-17~92, He et al. demonstrated that a truncated version of the
cluster (lacking miR-92) could cooperate with c-Myc and greatly accelerate tumorigenesis in
a mouse model of B cell lymphoma (He et al., 2005). Moreover, the miR-17~92 cluster itself
is among the transcriptional targets of c-Myc (O’Donnell et al., 2005). While miR-17~92
deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice
over-expressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitors cells develop a lymphoproliferative
disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al.,
2008). In contrast, mice carrying a homozygous deletion of the miR-17~92 locus exhibit
premature death of B cells at the pro-B/pre-B stage, resulting in lymphopenia (Ventura et al.,
2008).

HHMI Author Manuscript

While the full spectrum of genes regulated by the six miRNAs encoded by the miR-17~92
cluster is still unknown, one candidate, the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, has been proposed to be
a likely mediator of the B cell phenotype in miR-17~92-null and in miR-17~92 transgenic
mice (Ventura et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2008). Bim belongs to the family of pro-apoptotic
BH3 only proteins, and has long been known to be a critical regulator of B cell survival
(Bouillet et al., 1999; Bouillet et al., 2002) and a potent tumor suppressor gene in the EμMyc model of B cell lymphoma (Egle et al., 2004; Hemann et al., 2005). Its 3′UTR contains
multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17~92 and, consistent with Bim being a
direct target of miR-17~92, its levels are increased in miR-17~92 –null pre-B cells and
reduced in B cell from mice overexpressing miR-17~92. While Bim appears to be a
functionally relevant target of miR-17~92, the expression of many other genes is likely to be
controlled by this cluster, and many other putative targets have been identified (Dews et al.,
2006; Fontana et al., 2008; Fontana et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Petrocca et al., 2008).

miRNAs as tumor suppressors
Several miRNAs have been implicated as tumor suppressors based on their physical deletion
or reduced expression in human cancer. Beyond these associations, functional studies of a
subset of these miRNAs indicate that their over-expression can limit cancer cell growth or
induce apoptosis in cell culture or upon transplantation in suitable host animals. This
increasingly long list includes (but is not limited to) miR-15a~16-1 (Cimmino et al., 2005),
the let-7 family (reviewed in Bussing et al., 2008), miR-34a and miR-34-b~c (reviewed in
He et al., 2007b), miR-29 (Wang et al., 2008), miR-192 and miR-215 (Braun et al., 2008;

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 February 03.

Georges et al., 2008). However, in none of these cases has the definitive in vivo loss-offunction experiment been performed via gene targeting in the mouse.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The miR-15a~16-1 cluster of miRNAs has recently emerged as an excellent candidate to be
the long sought-after tumor suppressor gene on 13q14. This chromosomal region is deleted
in the majority of CLLs as well as mantle cell lymphomas and prostate cancers (Calin et al.,
2002). There is good circumstantial evidence that miR-15a~miR-16-1 is a bona fide tumor
suppressor. MiR-15a~16-1 is located in the minimally deleted region in CLL (Calin et al.,
2002), and a germ-line point mutation (a single base change) in pre-miR-16-1 has been
observed in a few CLL patients (Calin et al., 2005). This mutation has been linked to a
reduced expression of miR-16-1, possibly due to less efficient processing of the precursor
RNA, but large scale studies are needed to determine whether this is indeed a cancerpredisposing mutation. An interesting observation in this regard is that in New Zealand
Black mice (NZB), a mouse strain that shows a strong predisposition to the development of
a B lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) reminiscent of human CLL, a very similar base
change in pre-miR-16-1 has been linked to the development of LPD (Raveche et al., 2007).

HHMI Author Manuscript

It appears that the tumor suppressive activity of miR-15a~16-1 is not limited to B cells. Over
50% of human prostate cancers show deletion of 13q14. Accordingly, a recent study has
shown that inhibition of miR-15a and miR-16 activity leads to prostatic hyperplasia in mice
and promotes survival, proliferation and invasion of primary prostate cells in vitro (Bonci et
al., 2008). In the same study, the therapeutic potential of reconstituting expression of this
cluster was illustrated by the significant regression of prostatic tumor xenografts upon intratumoral delivery of miR-15a and miR-16-1. While the identity of the critical targets of these
two miRNAs is still unknown, the list of oncogenes that are directly regulated by miR-15a
and miR-16-1 include BCL2, CyclinD1 and WNT3A (Bonci et al., 2008; Cimmino et al.,
2005).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Among the most actively studied of the putative tumor suppressive miRNAs are the
members of the let-7 family (reviewed in Bussing et al., 2008)). The human genome
contains a dozen of let-7 family members, organized in eight different loci (http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000002). The first
member of the let-7 family was discovered in C. elegans, where it induces cell cycle exit
and terminal differentiation of a particular cell type at the transition from larval to adult life
(Reinhart et al., 2000). Consistent with a role in inhibiting tumor development in humans,
reduced levels of multiple members of the let-7 family are frequently observed in lung
cancers, where they correlate with poor prognosis (Takamizawa et al., 2004; Yanaihara et
al., 2006). In addition, various let-7 genes are located at chromosomal sites deleted in a
variety of human cancers (Calin et al., 2004). Let-7 genes can also be directly repressed by
the c-Myc oncoprotein (Chang et al., 2008) and their precursor RNAs subjected to inhibition
of further processing by lin-28 (Newman et al., 2008; Rybak et al., 2008; Viswanathan et al.,
2008). Functionally, let-7 has been shown to repress members of the Ras family of
oncogenes (Johnson et al., 2005) as well as the oncogene HMGA2 (Lee and Dutta, 2007;
Mayr et al., 2007) and even c-Myc itself (Sampson et al., 2007). In the best example of an
oncogenic mutation affecting a miRNA binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2
oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing over-expression of the
oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007). Finally, over-expression of let-7
miRNAs can suppress tumor development in mouse models of breast and lung cancer
(Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2007). Mouse knock-out
studies have not been reported for any let-7 family members, and, given the potential for
functional overlap within this family, it may be a while before it is clear whether loss of
let-7 function in the mouse can promote tumorigenesis.

A series of recent reports has explored the regulation of miRNAs by tumor suppressor
genes. These studies have focused on the miRNAs regulated by p53, a tumor suppressor
gene that is frequently inactivated in human cancers (reviewed in He et al., 2007b). This
approach has lead to the identification of the miR-34 family as being an important mediator
of p53 activity (Bommer et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2007; Corney et al., 2007; He et al.,
2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2006). This family
consists of three highly related miRNAs expressed from two separate loci: miR-34a from
chromosome 1p36 and miR-34b/miR-34c as a cluster from 11q23. The transcription of both
loci appears to be directly regulated by p53 via binding to conserved sites in the respective
promoters (Chang et al., 2007; Corney et al., 2007; He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al.,
2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2006). Similar to p53 itself, the expression of miR-34
can induce cell cycle arrest (Bommer et al., 2007; Cole et al., 2008; Corney et al., 2007;
Tarasov et al., 2007; Tazawa et al., 2007) or apoptosis (Chang et al., 2007; Cole et al., 2008;
He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Welch et al., 2007).
Reduced expression of miR-34b/miR-34c has been reported in breast and non-small cell
lung cancer cell lines (Bommer et al., 2007; Calin et al., 2004). Furthermore, miR-34a is
located on 1p36, a region of frequent hemizygous deletion in human neuroblastomas and a
variety of other cancers (Versteeg et al., 1995). Interestingly, this region includes another
candidate tumor suppressor gene, CDH5, that acts by inducing p53 expression via p19Arf
(Bagchi et al., 2007). Thus, a deletion of 1p36 can in principle impair the p53 pathway
simultaneously upstream and downstream of p53.

miRNAs as modulators of tumor progression and metastasis
In addition to their role in promoting the development of primary tumors, miRNAs have also
been implicated in affecting the tumor progression process, including the lethal, metastatic
phase of the disease. Several cell biological processes, including those controlling adhesion,
migration and invasion, are involved in allowing primary tumor cells to leave their original
location and move to another site in the body. Not surprisingly, miRNAs help to regulate
these processes as well and, as such, alterations in miRNA function can influence metastatic
potential (reviewed in Ma and Weinberg, 2008).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Among several putative pro-metastatic miRNAs, miR-10b and miR-373 are of particular
interest. miR-10b is a direct transcriptional target of Twist1 (Ma et al., 2007), a known
inducer of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic progression (Yang
et al., 2004). Ectopic expression of miR-10b in non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines
promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in
part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10 (Ma et al.,
2007). miR-373 was identified in a functional screen for miRNAs that could promote cell
migration in vitro (Huang et al., 2008) and its pro-metastatic potential has been validated in
tumor transplantation experiments (Huang et al., 2008) using breast cancer cells. Of note,
miR-373 had been previously identified as a potential oncogene (together with miR-372) in
testicular germ-cell tumors (Voorhoeve et al., 2006), although it has been proposed that the
prometastatic and the oncogenic properties of this miRNA are due to the regulation of
different genes (CD44 and LATS2, respectively).
Studies of breast cancers have also revealed a series of miRNAs that are both underexpressed in advanced cancers and capable of inhibiting cell migration and metastatic
spread. Members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs target the ZEB transcription factors,
known inducers of the EMT, and, thus, reduce cellular migration and invasiveness (Burk et
al., 2008; Gregory et al., 2008; Korpal et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008). Based on their
differential expression in non-metastatic versus metastatic breast cancer cell lines, miR-126,
miR-206 and miR-335 were also proposed to be inhibitors of tumor progression (Tavazoie et

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 February 03.

al., 2008). Indeed, over-expression of these miRNAs can inhibit metastasis in a cell
transplantation model and reduced expression of miR-126 and miR-335 correlates with poor
metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients (Tavazoie et al., 2008).

Global deregulation of miRNAs in cancer

HHMI Author Manuscript

In this review, we have focused on the role of specific miRNAs in tumorigenesis, an already
extensive and rapidly expanding list. However, recent work has also revealed intriguing
changes in the global state of miRNA expression in cancer. Specifically, miRNA expression
profiling experiments have demonstrated that most (although not all) miRNAs are underexpressed in tumor tissue compared to normal (Lu et al., 2005). While it is possible that this
phenomenon reflects the less differentiated state of the tumor cells and/or their higher
proliferation rate, one alternative explanation is that reduced miRNA levels are selected for
during tumorigenesis because this itself provide some proliferative or survival advantage.
These two possibilities are not necessarily mutually exclusive and indeed there is
experimental evidence for both. For example, a significant increase in miRNA levels is
observed upon induction of differentiation of the cancer cell line HL60 (Lu et al., 2005),
consistent with the function of miRNAs to reinforce transcriptional programs and help
maintain the differentiated state. On the other hand, working with experimental models of
lung cancer, Kumar and colleagues have shown that genetic or RNAi-based inhibition of
miRNA biogenesis can promote tumor formation and progression (Kumar et al., 2007).
Finally, a recent study has demonstrated a widespread transcriptional silencing of miRNAs
by c-Myc (Chang et al., 2008), suggesting that this might contribute to its potent oncogenic
activity.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Independent of the functional consequences of miRNA expression patterns in cancer,
miRNA profiles have value as diagnostic and prognostic markers of the disease. For
example, it is sometimes impossible to determine the tissue of origin of a metastasis in
patients with unknown primary tumors. Because many miRNAs display exquisite tissue
specificity, miRNA profiling of these lesions might prove useful. Indeed, Lu and colleagues
have shown that microRNAs profiling is more efficient at classifying poorly differentiated
cancers than mRNA profiling (Lu et al., 2005), and Rosenfeld et al. have demonstrated an
accuracy of ~90% in identifying the tissue of origin of primary and metastatic cancers using
a classifier based on 48 miRNAs (Rosenfeld et al., 2008). miRNA profiling of human cancer
might also help the oncologist identify the best treatment strategy by providing prognostic
information (reviewed in Barbarotto et al., 2008)). Indeed, in the two most common forms
of non-small cell lung cancers (adenocarcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas), high
expression of miR-155 and low expression of let-7 correlate with poor prognosis
(Takamizawa et al., 2004; Yanaihara et al., 2006). Similarly, in colon cancers, high miR-21
levels is associated with poor survival (Schetter et al., 2008), while in chronic lymphocytic
leukemias a miRNA “signature” composed of 13 miRNAs is associated with disease
progression (Calin et al., 2005). The results of these and other analogous reports are
promising, but it is important to note that larger scale studies will be required to validate the
usefulness of miRNA profiling in a clinical setting.

A view to the future
It is certainly too early to predict the full extent of the functions of miRNAs in cancer. A
clearer picture will likely emerge as the efforts to re-sequence the cancer genome reveal the
true frequency of mutations in miRNAs and in their target sequences in protein-coding
genes (although the latter will require specific analysis of the 3′ UTR regions). At the same
time, more sophisticated in vivo models will likely help determine the oncogenic and tumor
suppressive potential of individual miRNAs and miRNA families. Also, improved

experimental and computational methods to identify miRNA targets will provide a more
comprehensive understanding of their mechanism of action and of the pathways that they
modulate. It is difficult to overestimate the potential impact of these findings. As
increasingly effective pharmacological means to modulate miRNA activities are currently
being developed (Elmen et al., 2008a; Elmen et al., 2008b; Krutzfeldt et al., 2005),
identifying miRNAs that are essential for tumor maintenance or for metastasis might
provide exciting new therapeutic opportunities. What begun sixteen years ago as a peculiar
discovery in the simple worm has already gone a long way to change the way we think of
gene regulation. It might change the way we understand and treat cancers as well.
