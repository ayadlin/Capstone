ABSTRACT
We analyzed the role of ABCG2, a drug transporter, in determining the sensitivity
of glioma stem cells (GSCs) to demethoxycurcumin (DMC). We first demonstrated that
ABCG2 is more highly expressed in GSCs than primary astrocytes. Modulation of ABCG2
levels in GSCs by transfection of ABCG2 shRNA or a lentiviral vector encoding ABCG2
revealed an inverse relation between ABCG2 levels and DMC-induced GSC growth
inhibition. Suppressing ABCG2 increased DMC-induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest in GSCs. It also increased levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GSCs treated with
DMC, resulting in increased cytochrome C and caspase-3 activity. When GSCs transfected
with ABCG2 shRNA or overexpressing ABCG2 were xenografted and the tumor-bearing,
immunodeficient mice were treated with DMC, ABCG2 expression suppressed the tumor
proliferation rate (T/C %). These findings demonstrate that ABCG2 expression is critical
for DMC resistance in GSCs and is a potential therapeutic target for GBM.

related to ABCG2 and not MGMT [4]. This suggested that
the mechanisms of drug resistance in glioma cells and GSCs
were different.
ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member
2 (ABCG2) is a xenobiotic transporter that confers
resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs by transporting
intracellular drugs out of tumor cells. Robey et al found
that overexpression of ABCG2 lowered intracellular levels
of photosensitizers below the threshold required to induce
significant tumor cell death [5]. Inhibition of the ABCG2
transporter improved the efficacy of photodynamic
therapy on keratinocytes [6]. Recent studies showed that
ABCG2 expression was partly responsible for increased
resistance of GSCs to chemotherapy. Jia et al. reported
that inhibition of ABCG2 sensitized CD90+ CD133+ liver
CSCs to chemotherapeutic agents [7]. ABCG2 was also
highly expressed in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and
its inhibition by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) sensitized
BCSCs to doxorubicin, verapamil, and tamoxifen [8].

INTRODUCTION
Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are responsible for
the recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and
insensitivity to Temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line drug for
GBM treatment. GBM is an aggressive type of malignant
glioma with very low 2- and 5-year survival outcomes [1].
There are no effective agents to treat GSCs and the efficacy
of adjuvant therapy is limited. TMZ is a 3-methyl derivative
of mitozolomide that forms O6-methylguanine, which
inhibits GBM cell proliferation and induces apoptosis and
autophagy in glioma cells [2]. However, TMZ is ineffective
in inhibiting GSC proliferation and inducing their apoptosis
[3]. Fueyo et al. suggested that O6-methyl guanine -DNA
methyl transferase (MGMT) was responsible for resistance
of glioma cells to TMZ and therefore MGMT expression
formed the basis for clinical treatment strategies. However,
recent studies showed that drug resistance in GSCs was

Also, cervical cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are
characterized by prolonged cell survival, infinite cell
proliferation and highly resistant apoptosis became
sensitized by silencing ABCG2 expression [9]. Recently,
ABCG2 overexpression was confirmed in all GSCs [10,
11]. Xu et al reported that high expression of ABCG2 in
GSCs reduced accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents
and resulted in drug resistance [11]. Also, inhibition of
ABCG2 improved the efficacy of sonodynamic therapy
(SDT) in GSCs [11]. Jin et al reported that high ABCG2
expression in CD133+ GSCs conferred mitoxantone
resistance [12].
Demethoxycurcumin (DMC) is a major component
of Curcuma longa L, which effectively inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis in GSCs in vitro [13].
However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood.
Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the role of
ABCG2 in the chemoresistance of GSCs to DMC and if
its downregulation improved therapeutic efficacy of DMC
in a mouse xenograft model.

of ABCG2 in the primary GSCs and no expression in
the primary astrocytes. Further, immunohistochemical
staining of GSC spheres (Figure 1C) and flow cytometry
analysis showed that more than 97% GSC sphere
cells were ABCG2-positive (Figure 1B). These results
demonstrated that ABCG2 was highly expressed in the
GSCs and probably played an important role in their
function.

Association between ABCG2 expression and
efficiency of DMC inhibition of GSCs in vitro
Next, we determined the effects of DMC on cell
viability of GSCs by MTT assay. As shown in Figure
2A, treatment with 10μM DMC resulted in cell growth
inhibition of GSCs by 3.7%, 7.3% and 11.6% at 24, 48and
72 h, respectively. Similarly, 30μM DMC inhibited cell
growth of GSCs by 7.3%, 15.3%, and 23.6% at 24, 48 and
72h, respectively.
Further, we investigated if ABCG2 expression
influenced DMC-induced GSC growth inhibition.
Towards this, we transfected GSCs with lenti-GFPABCG2 shRNA and determined that ABCG2 was
significantly downregulated in GSCs (Figure 2B). Then,
we tested the inhibitory efficiency of DMC in ABCG2
knockdown GSCs. As shown in Figure 2C, treatment of
ABCG2 knockdown GSCs with 10μM DMC showed
growth inhibition of 13.2%, 23.7% and 31.6% for GSC1 and 7.2%, 15.3%, and 23.6% at for GSC-2 at 24, 48
and 72h, respectively. When treated with 30μM DMC, the
ABCG2 knockdowns GSC1 and GSC-2 showed a growth
inhibition rate of 15.3%, 27.1%, and 47.3% and 9.7%,

RESULTS
ABCG2 expression in primary astrocytes and
GSCs
Previous research showed that 40-50% WHO
III and WHO IV glioma tissues and 100% U251 GSCs
overexpressed ABCG2 [11, 12]. Hence, we analyzed
ABCG2 expression in primary astrocytes and GSCs by
RT-PCR and western blotting. As shown in Figure 1A
and 1B, we observed high mRNA and protein expression

19.3% and 36.1% at 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. Conversely,
we transfected GSCs with ABCG2 overexpressed vector
(lenti-GFP-ABCG2) and tested the growth inhibition
effects of 10 or 30μM DMC in GSC-1 and GSC-2. As
shown in Figure 2D, we observed increased resistance
to DMC in ABCG2 overexpressed GSC-1 and GSC2 compared to the controls. Collectively, these data
suggested that ABCG2 expression levels inversely
correlated with DMC efficacy in inhibiting GSCs.

reached about 50 mm3, the xenograft tumor-bearing nude
mice were administered with either 10mg/kg or 30mg/
kg DMC. After 30 days, the relative tumor proliferation
rate T/C (%) was determined to evaluate the antitumor
activity of DMC as described in the methods. As shown in
Figure 3A, T/C (%) in 10mg/kg or 30mg/kg DMC-alone
treatment group was 43.61% and 35.72% for GSC-1 and
53.61% and 37.62% for GSC-2, respectively. The T/C
(%) for ABCG2 knockdown (lenti-GFP-ABCG2 shRNA)
GSCs was 30.61% and 23.71% for GSC-1 and 43.71% and
29.31% for GSC-2, respectively for the 10mg/kg or 30mg/
kg DMC groups. These data suggested that downregulation
of ABCG2 enhanced the anti-tumor activity of DMC on the
GSC xenograft tumors. Conversely, the T/C (%) for ABCG2
overexpression (lenti-GFP-ABCG2) GSCs was 63.21%
and 53.21% in GSC-1 and 67.62% and 55.36% in GSC2, respectively for the 10mg/kg or 30mg/kg DMC groups.

Evaluation of ABCG2 expression on the antiGSC effects of DMC in vivo
Next, we evaluated the in vivo relevance of high or
low ABCG2 expression on the DMC inhibition of GSCs
by implanting 106 CD133-positive GSCs transfected with
either ABCG2 shRNA or overexpression lentiviral vectors
into immune-deficient nude mice. When the tumor volume

respectively. After 30 days, the mice were administered 10mg/kg or 30mg/kg DMC for 30 days. Then, relative tumor proliferation rates T/C

This suggested that ABCG2 overxpression decreased the
anti-tumor activity of DMC on GSCs xenograft tumors.
Further, tumor growth inhibition rate (%) (TGI%)
in 10mg/kg or 30mg/kg DMC-alone treatment group was
43.62% and 50.16% in GSC-1 and 40.32% and 43.71% in
GSC-2, respectively, whereas ABCG2 knockdown (LentiGFP-ABCG2 shRNA) resulted in the TGI% for the 10mg/
kg or 30mg/kg DMC groups was 60.32% and 71.23% in
GSC-1 and 53.32% and 67.21% in GSC-2, respectively.
In contrast, ABCG2 overxpression (Lenti-GFP-ABCG2)
resulted in the TGI% for the 10mg/kg or 30mg/kg DMC
group were 21.70% and 27.63% in GSC-1 and 17.32%
and 19.61% in GSC-2, respectively. These data again
showed that ABCG2 expression negatively regulated the
tumor growth inhibition rate of DMC on GSCs in vivo.

10μM and 30μM DMC for 48h increased G0/G1 cells
proportionately, compared to the controls (P<0.05;
Figure 4A). Moreover, ABCG2 downregulation (lentiGFP-ABCG2 shRNA) further increased G0/G1 phase
cells and ABCG2 overexpression (lenti-GFP-ABCG2)
lowered G0/G1 phase cells upon treatment of GSCs by
10μM and 30μM DMC. These data suggested that ABCG2
expression levels influenced DMC’s ability to inhibit cell
cycle in the GSCs.
In Figure 4A, we also observed increased sub-G1
upon 30μM DMC treatment of ABCG2 downregulated
(lenti-GFP-ABCG2 shRNA) GSCs, suggesting enhanced
apoptosis. To confirm enhanced apoptosis upon ABCG2
downregulation, we treated ABCG2 downregulated
GSCs with 30μM DMC and analyzed apoptosis by
TUNEL and Histone-DNA ELISA assays. We found
that co-administration of lenti-GFP-ABCG2 shRNA and
30μM DMC for 48h increased cell apoptosis of 12.15%
in GSCs-1 and 11% in GSCs-2 based on TUNEL assays
(Figure 4B), and 0.28-fold in GSCs-1 and 0.2-fold in
GSCs-2 based on Histone-DNA ELISA assays (Figure
4C) compared with 30μM DMC treatment. These results

induced apoptosis in GSCs.

noted that the high ABCG2 transporter protein levels
increased GSC resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs
[11]. ABCG2 pumps various chemotherapeutic drugs out
of the cells utilizing ATP hydrolysis and resulted in the
drug resistance manifestation of the GSCs [18]. Thus,
it was postulated that the ABCG2 levels were related to
chemotherapeutic efficacy.
Curcuminoids are yellow and slightly acidic
diarylheptanoids that include curcumin and its derivates
demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin
(BDMC) [19]. All three curcuminoids inhibit tumor
cell division and proliferation, with BMDC showing
strongest biological activity. However, recent studies
have shown that DMC is most effective against
gliomas [20]. Many studies have reported that the three
monomers of curcuminoids reverse the overexpression
of ABC transporters including ABCB1, ABCG2, and
ABCC1 in drug resistant tumor cells without causing
systemic toxicity [21, 22]. In our previous research, we
demonstrated that DMC potently inhibited proliferation
and induced apoptosis of GSCs [23]. Thus, we postulated
that ABCG2 was involved in drug resistance of GSCs to
DMC.
To explore the role of ABCG2 on modulating
the chemosensitivity of GSCs, we downregulated or
overexpressed ABCG2 in GSCs and tested the effects
of DMC in vitro and in vivo. We observed that ABCG2
was overexpressed in most of CD133+ GSCs and its
downregulation resulted in increased inhibition of
GSC proliferation and enhanced apoptosis by DMC. In
contrast, overexpression of ABCG2 in GSCs decreased the
sensitivity of GSCs to DMC. Thus, our data demonstrated
that ABCG2 represented a more attractive therapy target
for GSC chemotherapy.
Low intracellular levels of ROS are critical for
normal cell signaling function. However, over production
of ROS damages cellular components including
proteins, lipids and DNA, which ultimately results in
cell death [24]. ROS also play a crucial role in diverse
processes of various cancers. Cancer cells often display
higher ROS levels that promote cancer cell growth and
progression, although it also renders cancer cells more
vulnerable to adverse effects of high ROS. In fact, most
chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by inducing
oxidative stress. Buranrat et al. reported that simvastatin
and atorvastatin inhibited cancer cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis by increasing ROS in KKU-100 cell
line of human cholangiocarcinoma [25]. In leukemia cells,
docosahexaenoic acid sensitized leukemic lymphocytes to
barasertib and everolimus by enhancing ROS and strongly
inducing apoptosis [26]. In colon cancer, arctigenin
induced apoptosis through increased ROS by activation
of the p38 MAPK pathway [27]. Our previous research
showed DMC increase ROS in GSCs and triggered a
robust increase in GSC apoptosis [23].

Effects of ABCG2 deficiency on enhancing
DMC-induced anti-GSCs was mediated by ROS
production and caspase-3 signaling cascade
activation
Recently, Shen et al. reported that ABCG2
protected against oxidative stress by decreasing ROS
generation and enhancing antioxidant capacity [14].
Also, Oliva et al showed that low ROS production and
tighter mitochondrial coupling influence chemo-resistance
to TMZ in glioma [15]. Further, we previously showed
that DMC inhibited ROS production [13]. Thus, we
postulated that the higher ROS production would increase
the inhibitory activity of DMC in ABCG2 downregulated
GSCs. As shown in Figure 5A, 30μM DMC treatment
enhanced ROS in ABCG2 downregulated (Lenti-GFPABCG2 shRNA) GSCs compared to control. In contrast,
when GSCs with ABCG2 overexpression were treated
with 30μM DMC, ROS levels were lower than the control.
These results suggested that overexpression of ABCG2
increased antioxidant capacity of GSCs to DMC whereas
downregulation of ABCG2 decreased the antioxidant
capacity to DMC.
Further, we treated ABCG2 downregulated GSCs
with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to block
increased ROS induced by 30μM DMC treatment and
observed that it resulted in decreased cell growth inhibition
rate suggesting that ABCG2 expression modulated ROS
levels that were necessary for growth inhibitory effects of
DMC on GSCs (Figure 5B).
Since ROS production activates caspase-3 apoptotic
signaling cascade [16], we analyzed the cytochrome c
(Cyt c) release and caspase-3 activation after 30μM DMC
treatment in ABCG2 downregulated GSCs compared to
controls. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, downregulation
of ABCG2 enhanced Cyt c levels and caspase-3 activity.
In contrast, overxpression of ABCG2 reduced Cyt c
(Figure 5C) and caspase-3 activity (Figure 5D) upon
DMC treatment. These data suggested that ABCG2 levels
influenced DMC induced ROS-dependent activation of
caspase-3 mediated apoptosis in GSCs.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we confirmed that ABCG2
expression in GSCs determined the efficacy of DMC.
GSCs are resistant to most chemotherapeutic agents.
In glioma cells, drug resistance for TMZ was related
to O6- methyl guanine -DNA- methyl transferase
(MGMT) expression [17]. However, recent studies
have shown that high ABCG2 expression resulted in
poor therapeutic effects of TMZ on GSCs [4]. It was

However, the molecular pathways involved in DMCinduced ROS that result in cancer cell apoptosis have
remained unclear. Recently, Shen et al. found that ABCG2
played a protective role against oxidative stress by decreasing
ROS generation and enhancing antioxidant capacity in
Alzheimer’s disease [28]. They showed that ABCG2
overexpression inhibited ROS activation, protected cells
from ROS-induced toxicity/death, and the downregulation
of ABCG2 lead to increased ROS and inflammatory
response. Also, ABCG2 exported cytosolic oxidative
molecules and reduced overall cellular oxidative capacity.
Thus, we postulated that the selective increase of cellular
antioxidant capacity may be one of the possible mechanisms
by which ABCG2 protected GSCs against DMC. Our data
demonstrated that either upregulation or downregulation of
ABCG2 in GSCs resulted in lower or higher levels of ROS,
respectively, confirming our hypothesis. Therefore, our study
demonstrated that DMC induced oxidative stress in cancer
cells and ABCG2 overexpression decreased ROS, thereby
reducing the efficacy of DMC in GSCs. We demonstrated
that knockdown of ABCG2 restored high ROS levels and
therefore enhanced sensitivity of GSCs to DMC. Ding
et al reported that increased ROS resulted in extensive
oxidative DNA damage that upregulated pro-apoptotic
Bax and cleaved caspase-3, implying that increased ROS
activated caspase-3 signaling [29]. Therefore, we analyzed
the expression of Bax, Cyt c and caspase-3 and confirmed
that DMC treatment in GSCs with ABCG2 knockdown
increased Cyt c levels and caspase-3 activity whereas GSCs
with ABCG2 overexpression decreased Cyt c levels and
caspase-3 activity during DMC treatment.
In summary, we demonstrated that modulating the
expression of ABCG2 altered the efficacy of DMC therapy
on GSCs by regulating ROS production and thereby
influencing the caspase-3- apoptotic pathway. Hence,
ABCG2 is critical for DMC resistance in GSCs and is a
potential therapeutic target for GBM.

Primary gliostoma cells were dissociated from
cell culture dishes and resuspended in PBS with 0.5%
BSA and 2mM EDTA and incubated with CD133/1
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) followed by positive
magnetic cell separation using several MACS columns.
The purified CD133+ cells were stained with antiCD133/2-PE (Miltenyi Biotech) and analyzed on a BD
FACSCalibur. Then, neurosphere cultures were obtained
by growing CD133+ tumor cells in stem cell-permissive
DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 20ng/ml each
of human recombinant epidermal growth factor and
human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (R
and D Systems), and human leukemia inhibitory factor
(Chemicon) and 2% B27 (Life Technologies). These
culture conditions enabled tumor cells to retain the
molecular characteristics of the primary tumor, with only
minor changes in differentiation, expression pattern, and
genetic mutation profile.
Cultured primary astrocytes were generated from
a slightly injured brain tissue fragment obtained after
consent from a patient with cerebral trauma. The grey
matter was dissected and dispersed repeatedly after
washing in PBS. Primary astrocytes were cultured
according to the protocol described by Darling et al
[30].

MTT cell growth assay
To assess the effects of TMZ and/or DMC, 5x103
CD133+ GSCs/well were plated in 96-well plates with six
replicate wells at the indicated concentrations of TMZ
and/or DMC for 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h, respectively.
MTT assay was performed to analyze the cell proliferation
as described previously [10].

FACS analysis of cell cycle

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CD133+ cells that were treated with TMZ and/or
DMC were trypsinized and subsequently fixed with 70%
ice-cold ethanol for 1h. After PBS washing, the cells were
stained in HBSS containing 50μg/ml Propidium Iodide
(PI) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50μg/ml of RNase A (Boehringer
Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), for 1h at room temperature,
and analyzed by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose,
CA). The cell cycle analysis was performed by ModFit LT
software [11, 12].

Primary glioblastoma cell cultures
Human glioblastoma tissues were obtained after
informed consent from 2 adult patients diagnosed with
WHO grade IV glioma. Primary glioblastoma cell cultures
were obtained after mechanical dissociation according to
the protocol described by Darling et al [30]. The cells were
subcultured in DMEM with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) to
prevent the growth of contaminating rodent fibroblasts
for 1 week after which the cells were cultured in 10%
FCS and antibiotics of Penicillin and Streptomycin. Glial
origin was confirmed by morphology and staining with
the anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) monoclonal
antibody (mAb) clone 6F2 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
All experiments on these cells were performed before
passage 5.

Caspase-3 activity assay
The Caspase-3 activity was determined using
the Caspase-3 activity kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Haimen, China). The cells from various
samples were homogenized in 100μl reaction buffer
(1% NP40, 20mMTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137mM NAD and
10% glycerol) containing 10μl 2mM Ac-DEVD-pNA

Caspase-3 activity was measured with an ELISA reader at
an absorbance of 405 nm.

For TUNEL analysis, cells that were treated with
DMC and/or ABCG2 shRNA for 24 and 48h were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min before incubating
with In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche,

fluorescence microscopy [13].

measured tumor volume at each time point). Further, the
relative tumor proliferation rates (T/C %) were calculated
using the following formula: T/C % =(TRTV/CRTV) x 100%,
(TRTV: the treatment group RTV; CRTV: model control
group RTV). Also, the tumor growth inhibition rates
(TGI %) were calculated using the following formula:
Tumor growth inhibition rate =(Average tumor weight
of experimental group-Average tumor weight of model
group)/Average tumor weight of model group x 100%. All
mice procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Animal Care guidelines by the First People’s Hospital of
Kunshan affiliated with Jiangsu University. After 30 days,
tumor samples were snap-frozen for further experiments.

ELISA asssays of cell apoptosis

Western blot analysis

The Cell Apoptosis ELISA Detection Kit (Roche,
Palo Alto, CA) was used to detect Histone-DNA in GSCs
after different treatments according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Also, the PathScan® Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705)
Sandwich ELISA kit was employed to detect p-STAT3
(Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after indicated
treatments, cells from different samples were lysed in
ice-cold lysis buffer and bound to the immobilized first
detection antibody on the ELISA plates. Subsequently,
the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added
to each well. After adding the peroxidase substrate, the
Histone-DNA and p-STAT3 levels were determined
spectrophotmetrically at 405 and 450 nm, respectively.

For western analysis, GSC cells and tumor samples
were solubilized in the protein lysis buffer (137mM NaCl,
15mM EGTA, 0.1mM sodium orthovanadate, 15mM
MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25mM MOPS, 100μM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20μM leupeptin,
adjusted to pH 7.2). Then, 30μg protein per sample
was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli
discontinuous buffer system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA). The electrophoresed proteins were then
transferred to a PVDF membrane and then incubated
overnight with anti-human primary antibodies for Cyt c
(AC909, Beyotime Biotechnology Inc., Nanjing, China)
and ABCG2 (sc-18841, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). Then, after 1X TBST washes, the membranes
were incubated with the secondary antibodies (A0216,
Beyotime Biotechnology Inc., Nanjing, China) for 1h. The
blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL). For
control, the membranes were reprobed with a primary
GAPDH antibody (sc-47724, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) and further developed.

apoptosis

ROS production detection
To quantitate ROS in GSCs, cells were loaded with
1μM fluorescent dye dihydrorhodamine for 2h before
drug treatments. After the drug treatments, GSCs were
suspended in PBS on ice, fixed by 70% Ethanol at -20°C
and analyzed by FACS.

Statistical analysis

In vivo mouse xenograft tumor model

All statistical tests were performed using SPSS
Graduate Pack 11.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The
mean and SE, in addition to one-way ANOVAs were
determined to analyze significant differences between
groups of data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

In vitro cultured CD133+ GBM cells (2-5x 106 in
0.1 ml) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of
3-5 week old Balb/c nude mice (n=8/group; 18-22g).
After the tumor was established (about 50-75 mm3), as
determined by caliper measurements, the mice were
randomly distributed into the following 4 experimental
groups: (a) DMSO control: 100μL DMSO/PBS (1:1) ;
(b) TMZ-only: 20mg/kg TMZ in 100μL DMSO/PBS;
(C) DMC-only: 10 or 30mg/kg DMC in 100μL DMSO/
PBS; and (iv) 20mg/kg TMZ plus 10 or 30mg/kg DMC in
100μL DMSO/PBS. The treatments were given daily for
24 days. Then, tumor volumes were calculated using the
following formula: tumor volume (TV) = (length × width2)
× 0.5. Based on the absolute tumor volume measurements,
we calculated the relative tumor volume (RTV) as RTV =
Vt/V0 (V0, the measured tumor volume at day 0; Vt, the
