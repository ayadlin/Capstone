ABSTRACT
Substantial evidence now demonstrates that interactions between the tumor
microenvironment and malignant cells are a critical component of clinical drug
resistance. However, the mechanisms responsible for microenvironment-mediated
chemoprotection remain unclear. We showed that bone marrow (BM) stromal
cytochrome P450 (CYP)26 enzymes protect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
from the pro-differentiation effects of retinoic acid. Here, we investigated if stromal
expression of CYPs is a general mechanism of chemoprotection. We found that similar
to human hepatocytes, human BM-derived stromal cells expressed a variety of drugmetabolizing enzymes. CYP3A4, the liver’s major drug-metabolizing enzyme, was
at least partially responsible for BM stroma’s ability to protect multiple myeloma
(MM) and leukemia cells from bortezomib and etoposide, respectively, both in vitro
and in vivo. Moreover, clarithromycin overcame stromal-mediated MM resistance
to dexamethasone, suggesting that CYP3A4 inhibition plays a role in its ability to
augment the activity of lenalidomide and dexamethasone as part of the BiRd regimen.
We uncovered a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance,
whereby the BM niche creates a sanctuary site from drugs. Targeting these sanctuaries
holds promise for eliminating minimal residual tumor and improving cancer outcomes.

microenvironment remain unclear. It is well
recognized  that specific tissues such as the central
nervous system and the testes can act as sanctuary
sites from drugs [8, 9]. We previously showed that
bone marrow (BM) stroma protects normal human
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the prodifferentiating effects of retinoic acid by expressing the
retinoid-inactivating enzyme, CYP26 [10]. Here, we
investigate if the BM microenvironment’s expression
of drug-metabolizing enzymes may represent a
previously unrecognized more general mechanism of
chemoprotection. We show that human BM stromal
cells, but not hematopoietic cells, express drugmetabolizing enzymes at levels comparable to human
hepatocytes. Moreover, we found that stromal CYP3A4
is at least partially responsible for microenvironmentdependent drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION
The majority of patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and other hematologic malignancies
achieve complete remissions with initial chemotherapy,
but eventually relapse and die of their disease. The
mechanisms responsible for the resistance of minimal
residual disease (MRD) to therapy remain critical areas
of research. There is increasing evidence that specialized
microenvironments or niches play important roles in
drug resistance [1–4]. Several studies have suggested a
role for physical interactions as well as soluble factors
in niche-mediated chemoprotection [5]. Accordingly,
clinical trials targeting the microenvironment to improve
chemosensitivity are ongoing [6, 7].
However, the exact mechanisms responsible
for the chemoprotection afforded by the tumor

compartment (CD34+CD38-) showed limited expression
of CYPs, with only low relative mRNA levels of two
drug-metabolizing CYPs (2C8 and 2D6) and the
orphan 2S1. Cytidine deaminase, another important
drug metabolizing enzyme showed the same pattern of
expression (Figure 1A).
The expression of CYP3A4, estimated to
metabolize more than half of all chemotherapeutics [16],
was further confirmed in primary BM stroma cells
as well as human BM mesenchymal progenitor cells,
F/STRO, by qRT-PCR. We found that CYP3A4 mRNA
expression was similar in F/STRO and human primary
BM stroma. CYP3A4 levels in BM stroma were
about 30–50% of the levels in HepG2 cells, whereas
its expression was barely detectable in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) (Kasumi 1, OCI-AML3 and KG1) and
multiple myeloma (MM) (H929 and RPMI 8226) cells
(Figure 1B).

Bone marrow stroma highly expresses drug
metabolizing enzymes
The CYP superfamily encompasses 57 enzymes
that catalyze the oxidation of various organic substrates,
from intermediary steps in cholesterol metabolism to
drugs and other chemicals [13]. Most of the xenobiotic
and drug metabolizing CYPs are expressed in the
liver. Extra-hepatic expression is usually restricted to
barrier tissue such as lungs, skin, and gut [14]. Using
qRT-PCR array, a total of 42 CYPs were analyzed in
primary human BM stroma. Most enzymes displayed
comparable mRNA levels in stroma and HepG2
cells, a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line routinely
used for study of CYP enzymes [15] (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Table). In contrast, the human HSC

MM resistance to chemotherapy

spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Supplementary Figure 2).
After 24 h, dexamethasone levels were 70% reduced
in the stromal conditioned media compared to liquid
control (p < 0.01). Clarithromycin or anti - CYP3A4
shRNA restored the dexamethasone levels in the stromal
conditioned media.
Accordingly, inhibition of CYP3A4 by clarithromycin
or shRNA-mediated knockdown reversed the stromalmediated
protection
of
MM
cells
against
dexamethasone (Figure 2B). Clarithromycin had no
effect on dexamethasone’s anti-MM activity in the absence
of mesenchymal stroma (data not shown).

As previously reported, MM cells are highly
resistant to bortezomib in the presence of BM stroma [2]
(Figure 2A). Since bortezomib is predominantly
metabolized by CYP3A4, we inhibited this enzyme in
stroma by either ketoconazole or by lentiviral-mediated
knockdown via shRNA (this method effectively eliminated
CYP3A4 mRNA from stroma cells - Supplementary
Figure 1). Both approaches partially restored bortezomib’s
activity against MM cells in the presence of BM stroma
(Figure 2A). Ketoconazole had no effect in the absence of
BM stroma (data not shown).
The addition of clarithromycin (Biaxin) to
lenalidomide and dexamethasone has been recently
shown to improve remission rates not only in treatmentnaïve patients [17, 18] but also patients previously
resistant to lenalidomide and dexamethasone [19]. While
an initial report suggested that clarithromycin might
have single agent activity in MM [20], subsequent data
demonstrated no activity as a single agent [21, 22]. Since
clarithromycin is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor [23, 24],
we investigated if this may be a potential mechanism for
its activity in MM as part of BiRd [Biaxin, lenalidomide
(Revlimid), dexamethasone] regimen. BM stroma was
incubated with 10–6 M dexamethasone and drug levels
were measured by liquid chromatography – tandem mass

The topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, which is also
predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 [25], remains one
of the most important agents in the treatment of AML. BM
stroma protected AML cells from the cytotoxic effects
of etoposide (Figure 3A). Similar to our findings with
bortezomib and dexamethasone, inhibition of CYP3A4
by ketoconazole or shRNA CYP3A4 knockdown partially
restored etoposide cytotoxicity in the presence of stroma
(Figure 3A).
To further study the role of microenvironment drug
detoxifying enzymes in an in vivo model, we developed a
xenograft model of human AML - BM stroma interactions.

Luciferase expressing KG-1 AML cells and human
BM stroma transduced with either control shRNA
(Control) or anti-CYP3A4 shRNA (CYP3A4 KO) were
injected subcutaneously into NSG mice (Figure 3B).
Each mouse carried AML cells + Control stroma in the
right flank and AML + CYP3A4 KO stroma in the left
flank. After  establishment of the tumors (14 days post
subcutaneous injection), the mice were treated with
etoposide (1.2 mg/kg/day) by intraperitoneal injection.
There was no difference in tumor growth before initiation
of etoposide (Supplementary Figure 3A). However,
while the AML continued to grow exponentially with the

Control stroma, the AML with CYP3A4KO stroma showed
a  significant response to etoposide treatment (Figure 3C
and 3D and Supplementary Figure 3B).

DISCUSSION
Newer chemotherapeutic agents have dramatically
improved the response rates of hematological malignancies,
yet progress toward cures has lagged. Research efforts have
identified unique cell-intrinsic [26], and more recently,
tumor
microenvironment-dependent,
cell-extrinsic
mechanisms of drug resistance [6]. Although agents
14908

targeting the malignant microenvironment are currently in
various stages of clinical development [6]. The mechanisms
responsible for microenvironment-mediated drug resistance
have remained unclear and are likely multifactorial. Several
studies have suggested a role for physical interactions
mediated by adhesion molecules. Accordingly, treatment
with cytarabine in combination with a blocking antibody
to integrin α4β1, and thus impaired adhesion to fibronectin,
resulted in improved disease-free survival in a murine model
of AML [27]. Similarly, the combination of bortezomib
and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 partially overcame
microenvironment-mediated resistance in MM [28].
Soluble factors may also participate in microenvironmentmediated chemoprotection, as stromal co-culture enhanced
malignant cell drug resistance in the absence of physical
interactions [1, 29]. However, monoclonal antibodies
targeting potential etiologic factors and cytokines such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), did not
reverse stroma-mediated resistance [1].
Although CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes have
been implicated in both systemic (by hepatic inactivation)
[30–33] and cell-intrinsic [34, 35] drug resistance, their
role within the tumor microenvironment has never been
studied. Here, we show for the first time that CYP enzymes
are highly expressed in BM stroma. Moreover, CYP3A4
expression appears to participate in the chemoprotection
provided by BM stroma against both MM and AML. Other
drug metabolizing enzymes, such as cytidine deaminase
which is responsible for cytarabine metabolism, are
also expressed by BM stroma. Thus, drug metabolizing
enzymes expressed in the tumor microenvironment could
represent biochemical barriers between plasma and unique
malignant cell niches resulting in potential sanctuary sites
from drugs. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as affinity
(Km) and velocity (Vmax) constants may allow CYPs to
play complementary roles in the systemic (hepatic) and
local (microenvironmental) inactivation of drugs [36].
While initial studies hypothesized that clarithromycin
may work in MM via its immunomodulatory effects [37],
our results suggest that it augments the cytotoxicity of
dexamethasone via inhibition of stromal CYP3A4. Not
only does charithromycin overcome MM resistance to
lenalidomide and dexamethasone [19], but it also increases
response rates when used as upfront therapy [18]. These
data together with our results suggest that the addition
of clarithromycin could preferentially target a subset
of MM cells not usually affected by lenalidomide and
dexamethasone, perhaps those in close contact with the
BM microenvironment.
Targeting drug metabolizing enzymes in the tumor
microenvironment holds promise for eliminating MRD
and improving cancer outcomes. Inhibition of CYPs in the
liver has been studied clinically, with expected increased
systemic drug levels. Pharmacologically adjusting drug

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

doses to maintain safe systemic concentrations in the
presence of CYP inhibitors, should control for hepatic
inhibition of these enzymes while at the same time
removing the barriers to therapeutic drug levels in the
tumor microenvironment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures
All cell lines except F/STRO were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection and cultured per their
recommendations. F/STRO was a kind gift from Dr. Pierre
Marie; and was cultured as previously described [11].
Primary human BM stroma and hematopoietic cells were
derived from aspirates collected from normal donors on an
IRB-approved protocol at Johns Hopkins as we previously
described [10].
For co-cultures, stromal cells were irradiated (20Gy)
and plated to generate a monolayer. Hematopoietic
cells were plated on top of the monolayer and treated
with 2.5 nM bortezomib (Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
Cambridge, MA), 1 μM etoposide (Sigma, St. Louis MO),
0.1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma) ± 3 μM ketoconazole
(Sigma) or 1 μM clarithromycin (Sigma) for 72 h at 37°C.

Clonogenic assays
Clonogenic assays were performed as described [10].
Briefly, after drug incubations, the malignant cells were
collected, washed with PBS and plated (700 cells/ml
for KG1 and 5000 cells/ml for H929) in 1 ml of 1.32%
methylcellulose (Sigma) supplemented with 30% FBS, 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA – Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine
and 0.1 μM 2-ME. Cells were plated in triplicates in
35 mm culture dishes, incubated at 37°C and scored for
the presence of colonies at day 10 for KG-1 and day 14
for H929 cells.

Lentiviral infection: shRNA and luciferase
Lentiviral pLKO.1shRNA vectors were obtained
from the RNAiConsortium (Broad Institute, Cambridge,
MA). Supernatants were produced and stromal cells were
infected as we have previously published [10]. Infected
cells were selected using 3 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) for
5 days. To mark KG-1 cells with Luciferase, pLenti-CMVLUC-Puro lentiviral vectors [12] were purchased from
Addgene (plasmid #17477) and lentiviral supernatants
were produced as we have previously published [10].
KG-1 cells were incubated with the lentiviral supernatant
in the presence of 8 μg/mL of polybrene (Sigma) and span
down at 2500 RPM, 30 min at room temperature. After
centrifugation, the cells were cultured at 37ºC for at least
48 h prior to selection using 1 μg/mL puromycin.

of 16-week old of NOD SCID IL2γ-/- (NSG) mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). After tumor
engraftment, as determined by exponential increase in
bioluminescence, mice were treated with 1.2 mg/kg
etoposide via daily intraperitoneal injection. Tumor burden
was assessed by bioluminescence, using the In Vivo
Imaging System (IVIS, Perkin Elmer, Alameda, Ca). For
imaging, mice were exposed to 30 mg/kg D-luciferin
(Xenogen) via intraperitoneal injection 10–15 minutes
prior to imaging and were anesthetized using isoflurane
(VetOne, Boise, ID). Images were analyzed with Living
Image Software 2.5 (Perkin Elmer) and data quantified as
photons/second.
