ABSTRACT:
Spheroid formation is one property of stem cells—such as embryo-derived or
neural stem cells—that has been used for the enrichment of cancer stem-like cells
(CSLCs). However, it is unclear whether CSLC-derived spheroids are heterogeneous
or whether they share common embryonic stemness properties. Understanding these
features might lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Ovarian carcinoma is a deadly
disease of women. We identified two types of spheroids (SR1 and SR2) from ovarian
cancer cell lines and patients’ specimens according to their morphology. Both types
expressed stemness markers and could self-renew and initiate tumors when a low
number of cells were used. Only SR1 could differentiate into multiple-lineage cell
types under specific induction conditions. SR1 spheroids could differentiate to SR2
spheroids through epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
was highly expressed in SR1 spheroids, decreased in SR2 spheroids, and was absent
in differentiated progenies in accordance with the loss of stemness properties. We
verified that ALP can be a marker for ovarian CSLCs, and patients with greater ALP
expression is related to advanced clinical stages and have a higher risk of recurrence
and lower survival rate. The ALP inhibitor, levamisole, disrupted the self-renewal of
ovarian CSLCs in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In summary, this research provides
a plastic ovarian cancer stem cell model and a new understanding of the crosslink between stem cells and cancers. This results show that ovarian CSLCs can be
suppressed by levamisole. Our findings demonstrated that some ovarian CSLCs may
restore ALP activity, and this suggests that inhibition of ALP activity may present a
new opportunity for treatment of ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

cancers supports the stem-like origin of these cells [17-20].
However, the translineage differentiation capacity seen in
pluripotent stem cells has not been observed in CSLCs
[18-20]. The investigation of ovarian cancer stem-like
spheroids might further elucidate the concept of cancer
stemness in ovarian cancer development. Improving
our understanding of ovarian CSLCs might also help in
finding practicable therapeutic targets [15, 21, 22].
In the current study, we hypothesized that ovarian
CSLCs would prove to possess different stemness status.
We observed two types of ovarian CSLCs. Both of them
fulfilled the definition of a CSLC, but only one of them
possessed translineage differentiation capability. We
also found that ovarian cancer development involves an
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian
CSLCs. The suppression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity inhibited the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of
ovarian CSLCs. These findings provide evidence of a
stemness hierarchy in ovarian cancer development. We
also suggest that ALP might be a therapeutic target for
women with ovarian cancers.

Differentiated descendant tissue cells do not exhibit
some capacities of stem cells, such as being viable in
suspension culture, and spheroid formation [1]. Stem cells
can form spheroids in suspension, indicating that they are
capable of proliferation, self-renewal and multipotency
[1]. This property “spheroid formation” is usually
applied to cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) or spheroids
for enrichment and to prove the stemness properties in
those isolated cells [2, 3]. Such spheroid populations are
generally ball-shaped, morula-like or irregularly shaped.
It is not clear whether variations in morphology represent
heterogeneous characteristics, such as differences in the
stemness properties and hierarchical order, or whether
they arise from natural properties in different types of
cells. Distinct stemness markers or factors have also
been proposed between the cancer stem-like spheroids
from different types of tissues [3, 4]. The formation of
cancer stem-like spheroids described in previous studies
in vitro depended on special cell culture conditions rather
than on the presence of spheroids forming during cancer
development. Indeed, spheroid formation is a unique
common phenomenon in ascites fluid of patients with
ovarian cancers. It is still unclear whether spheroids
formed from ovarian cancer are a single kind of CSLC
[5-8]. To date, no study has investigated spheroids with
diverse morphologies derived from ovarian cancers,
especially those harvested from ascites or tumor tissues.
Our group previously characterized tumor-initiating
spheroids expressing the surface markers CD44 and
CD117 (c-Kit) [9]. Others have also reported that surface
markers of ovarian tumor-initiating cells or ovarian
CSLCs include CD133, CD24 and CD44/MyD88 [1012]. Surface-marker-free methods also revealed side
populations and quiescent CSLCs from ovarian cancer
cell lines and other human cancerous tissues [7, 1315]. The existence of ovarian epithelial stem cells is
controversial, and there is insufficient evidence of the
location of ovarian CSLCs within the abdominal cavity.
A recent report has provided clues about the location of
the stem cell niche for ovarian surface epithelial cells
(OSEs) at the transitional area between the ovarian surface
epithelium, mesothelium and tubal epithelium [16]. These
OSEs from the hilum form spheroids in culture, show a
dormancy-like phenotype, and display stem cell markers
and long-term stem cell properties [16]. These stem-like
and cancer-prone OSEs are thought to be the origin of
high-grade serous type ovarian cancers. However, whether
these stem-like OSEs possess translineage differentiation
capability is not known, and whether the induced cancer
cells retain stem-like properties has not been examined.
There are insufficient data so far showing the direct
transition of normal stem-like OSEs to ovarian CSLCs. In
addition, the hierarchy of differentiation-related markers
in CSLCs from melanomas and from colon and prostate

RESULTS
Two types of ovarian cancer spheroids have
different morphologies and stem properties
We cultivated four human epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC) cell lines using stem cell suspended-culture
conditions [23], which produced two distinctive types
of spheres (SR1 and SR2) (Figure 1A). Each cell line
preferred to develop into different types of spheres; the
EOC cell lines SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 generated more
SR1, A2780 cells formed more SR2, and CP70 cells could
develop into both SR1 and SR2 simultaneously. SR1
exhibited a ball shape with a smooth surface, and SR2
was irregular in shape with a morula-like surface (Figure
1A). The morphology of SR1 and SR2 also differed under
adhesion culture conditions (Supplementary Information,
Figure S1A), For the assessment of stemness, flow
cytometry was used to detect stem-associated markers in
the two types of spheroids; the CD44+CD133+ population
increased significantly in SKOV3SR1 and A2780SR2
cells, and the CD44–CD133+ population also increased
in A2780SR2 cells (Figure 1B and 1C). Expression of
OCT4 and SOX2 increased in SKOV3SR1 and A2780SR2
cells but with different magnitude of the change (Figure
1D and 1E). Immunocytochemistry staining confirmed
that CD133 expression (Figure 1F and 1G) decreased
significantly after induction of SKOV3SR1 differentiation.

Figure S1C) [18, 24]. CP70SR1 and SR2 clones derived
from single cells (also known as CP70SR1SC and
CP70SR2SC, respectively) were isolated by limiting
dilution. The size of the spheres did not appear to affect
the distinctive appearance (Figure 2A and 2B); however,
self-renewal was slower for SR1 than for SR2, suggesting

A diversity of morphology was observed in the
suspension cultures of original CP70 cells (Supplementary
Information, Figure S1B). To assess stemness properties of

derived from SKOV3 and A2780 cells, whereas CD44+CD133– and CD44–CD133+ were expressed in the original SKOV3 and A2780 cells,
respectively. The expression of CD133 and OCT4 was higher in SKOV3SR1 cells (B, D), whereas the expression of OCT4 and SOX2 was
higher in A2780SR2 cells (C, E). (F, G) Expression of CD133 and CD44 was compared between adhesive SKOV3-derived SR1 and the
original cells. (F) After adhesive culture for 24 hours, the expression of CD133 decreased in adhesive SKOV3-derived SR1 from the center
site to the periphery, but CD133 in scattered SR1 cells was still detectable in the periphery. (G) Almost all SKOV3 original cells expressed
CD44 but not CD133.

SR1 was more dormant than SR2 [13]. Flow cytometry
was used to identify the expression of CD44 [9, 21],
CD117 [9], CD133 [6, 11], NANOG, and SSEA4 [25].
There was an order of stem-like cell hierarchy between

CP70SR1, SR2, differentiated SR, and original CP70
cells (Figure 2C and 2D, Supplementary Information,
Figure S1D). Interestingly, CP70SR1SC branched out and
exhibited at least 10 different morphologies (Figure 2E).

Figure 2: Characterization of single-cell clones isolated from CP70 SR1 and SR2 spheroids. (A, B) Single cell-derived SR1

and SR2 clones are referred to as SR1SC and SR2SC, respectively. The surface of SR1SC (A) was smooth regardless of the size, whereas
SR2SC (B) was morula like. (C, D) Stemness-associated markers were detected in single cell-derived SR1, SR2, and SR cells 6 weeks after
differentiation, and in the original cells. (C) The population of CD133+/CD44+ cells was the highest in SR1 followed by SR2, differentiated
SR cells, and the original cells. (D) Expression of both the stemness-associated marker NANOG and hESC-related marker SSEA4 was
increased in the order SR1, SR2, and SR differentiated cells. SSEA4 expression was lower in CP70 original cells than in their counterpart
SR cells. (E) Dissociated SR1SC cells were induced to differentiate for 14 days. At least 10 types of morphology (white arrows) with a
neuron-like phenotype were observed in different fields of view, whereas CP70SR2 cells differentiated only to a simple and tumor-like
morphology (F). Neuron-like morphology was observed only in CP70SR1 cells (G), and expression of multiple neuronal markers was
detected by immunostaining using anti-pan-neuronal antibodies (H). However, most CP70SR2 cells were dead when treated under the
condition described above for 16 days (I).

By contrast, CP70SR2SC showed only basic tumor cell
morphology (Figure 2F).
To determine whether SR1 and SR2 retained
their tumorigenic capacity as in ovarian CSLCs [9,
11, 13], we tested this using an in vivo animal model
of tumorigenesis. As few as 1000 CP70SR1SC cells
could propagate a visible tumor nodule 6 weeks after
implantation (Supplementary Information, Figures
S2A–C). The tumor sections were classified as a poorly

differentiated malignancy of human origin (Supplementary
Information, Figure S2D). The high tumorigenicity of
CP70SR2SC was also confirmed in vivo (Supplementary
Information, Figure S3). Various markers were applied in
immunohistochemistry to determine whether CP70SR1SC
could differentiate spontaneously and propagate tumors
in vivo. The expression of CD44 and CD133 decreased
(Supplementary Information, Figure S2E) and, to our
surprise, human-specific endothelial-associated marker

SR2, and their original counterpart cells from CP70 (A) and SKOV3 (B) cells were induced by adipogenesis-inducing medium for 14 days
and stained with oil red O solution. Only SR1 and SR2 cells, but not the original cells, displayed lipid droplets in the cell body (white

in either adipogenesis-inducing medium or SR culture medium. Oil droplets were observed only in SR1 cells cultured in adipogenesisinducing medium. (D) The osteogenesis capacity of SKOV3-derived SR1 cells and its original counterpart cells were examined. Only
SR1 cells cultured in osteogenesis-inducing medium displayed osteocyte morphology with the osteogenic marker, ALP activity, 14 days
after induction. Differentiated CP70SR1 were induced by osteogenesis (E) and chondrogenesis (F) and detected by specific staining.
Undifferentiated CP70SR1 without induction retained a tumor-like morphology and showed no signals.

combined antibodies against E-cad and N-cad (red arrow), and protein expression was analyzed by three-dimensional dissection using
the DeltaVision system. E-cadherin was expressed throughout the entire SR1, only in the center of SR2, and N-cad was expressed only
at the border. (C) After differentiation, SR1 cells grown under the adhesion condition showed a different pattern of ALP activity from the
center to the periphery. SR2 cells showed weaker adhesion ability, and ALP activity was detectable only in certain regions. (D, E) The
expression and location of E-cad and N-cad differed significantly between SR1 and SR2. The expression of E-cad and N-cad decreased
from undifferentiated cells (center) to differentiated cells (boundary) in both SR1 and SR2. (D) E-cadherin was expressed mainly in the
center of adhesive SR1, whereas the expression of N-cad was weaker at the same site. (E) In adhesive SR2, N-cad was expressed in most
cells but with different strength, whereas E-cad was detectable only in the center.

neurogenesis potency. Single cells dissociated from
CP70SR1SC (Supplementary Information, Figure S4A)
under induction exhibited neuron-like morphology and
expressed the premature neural marker α-internexin, and
this could be further demonstrated by the observation
of induced an entire CP70SR1SC neuronal-like
differentiation (Supplementary Information, Figure
S4D). This phenomenon was present only in induced
SR1 (Supplementary Information, Figure S4A and S4B)

and not in SR2 (Supplementary Information, Figure
S4C). Long-term treatment of CP70SR1 under the
modified induction condition produced more neuron-like
morphology (Figure 2G), and the cells expressed at least
one of four types of neural-associated markers (Figure
2H, Supplementary Information, Figure S4E). However,
no CP70SR2 survived in the same condition (Figure 2I).
Furthermore, in the same condition, SKOV3SR1 cells also
exhibited elongate dendrite- and axon-like morphology

supporting the potency of the translineage differentiation.
Furthermore, the ALP activity (Figure 4G and 4H)

A hierarchy of stemness could be defined between
SR1, SR2, and their differentiated progenies (Figure 2C
and 2D, Supplementary Information, Figure S1D). EMT
was reported to be involved in the stemness of cancer
cells [35-37]. However, the EMT status of SR1 and SR2
is unknown. During the modified culture, some single
SKOV3- (Supplementary Information, Figure S5D) and
CP70-derived SR1 (Supplementary Information, Figure
S5E) showed the simultaneous appearance of features of
both SR1 and SR2.
We next investigated the roles of EMT in SR1 and
SR2 using the expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin
as an index [38, 39]. Increasing evidence indicates that
E-cadherin expression maintains colony formation and
self-renewal of hESCs [40, 41] and neural stem cells
[42], and increases the generation of induced pluripotent
stem cells [43, 44]. In addition, declining E-cadherin
expression will result in the loss of multipotency [42].
E-cadherin expression was found in most of the SR1
main body, while N-cadherin was only detected in a few
spots (Figure 5A). Interestingly, the entire SR2 showed an
EMT-like situation; E-cadherin was expressed dominantly
in the center of the spheroid and was surrounded by the
N-cadherin signal in the periphery (Figure 5B). After longterm differentiation, ALP activity was lost in the periphery
of the differentiated SR1 and SR2 (Figure 5C). E-cadherin
was expressed mainly in the center of SR1, similar to
the ALP signal (Figure 5D), where the expression of
N-cadherin was weaker (Figure 5D). The loss of ALP
activity and EMT occurring in differentiated SR1 is similar
to the differentiated process of human ESCs (hESCs) [34,
45]. Differentiated SR2 maintained high expression of
N-cadherin in the center, but the expression decreased in
the periphery (Figure 5E). ALP activity (Supplementary
Information, Figure S6A) and the distribution of
E-cadherin and N-cadherin (Supplementary Information,
Figure S6B) also differed significantly between SR1 and
SR2. These results indicated SR1 that stays at the higher

Information, Figure S4F).
After observing this change in morphology (Figure
2E), we confirmed the adipogenic potency of CP70- and
SKOV3-derived SR1 and SR2 (Figure 3A and 3B). The
original tumor cells barely exhibited this differentiated
capacity (Figure 3A and 3B). Only OVCAR-3SR1
differentiated into adipocyte-like cells under the induction
condition (Figure 3C). Specific dye staining demonstrated
the osteogenic induction of SKOV-3SR1 and CP70SR1
(Figure 3D and 3E) as well as chondrogenesis of CP70SR1
(Figure 3F).
Alkaline phosphatase is a hydrolase responsible
for removing phosphate groups from nucleotides [31],
proteins, and alkaloids. ALP activity can be used to
test the stemness pluripotency of ESCs or embryonic
carcinoma cells [32-34]. We tested whether ALP was
active in ovarian cancer stem-like spheroids enriched from
cell lines and patients’ specimens. However, only some
spheroids possessed distinct ALP activity (Figure 4A).
For confirmation of ALP activity, a single SR1 spheroid
was dissected, and almost every cell was ALP positive
(Supplementary Information, Figure S5A and S5B);
however, the ALP activity decreased in SR progenies after

Information, Figure S7A, S7B, and S7D, Table 2). Patients
with greater ALP expression exhibited a higher recurrence
ratio (Figure 6E and 6F) (p=.02) and lower overall
survival (p=.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that ALP
expression was also strongly associated with cancer stage
and nuclear grade, indicating ALP was not an independent
factor in the recurrence and survival in patients (Table 2).
To sum up, the existence of ALP in cancer cells may be
associated with stem properties and tumorigenesis of EOC
cells.

ALP as a potential therapeutic target and poor
prognostic factor for patients with ovarian
cancers
The upregulation of ALP in hepatocellular
CSLCs has been reported recently [25]. We aimed to
clarify whether ALP plays an important role in ovarian
CSLCs. Levamisole suppressed sphere formation of SR1
originating from the CP70 cell line and human specimens
(Figure 6A). The quantity of spheres formed and basic
morphology of these spheres were also significantly
affected, indicating that ALP inactivation inhibited ovarian
CSLC self-renewal (Supplementary Information, Figure
S6C). Tumor formation was repressed only in mice that
had received oral levamisole (Figure 6B and 6C).
The role of ALP in human EOC was verified by
immunohistochemical staining using ovarian cancer tissue
arrays [21, 46]. ALP expression was higher in malignant
tumors (Figure 6D, Supplementary Information, Figure
S7A and S7B) than in benign and borderline tumors
(Supplementary Information, Figure S7A-C). EOC
patients were classified according to ALP expression

DISCUSSION
The CSLC hypothesis proposes that tumors exhibit
a hierarchical organization and that only a subset of cells
with stem cell properties possess self-renewal capacity,
drive tumor initiation and sustain tumor growth [4, 48].
Different models of carcinogenesis based on this concept
have been proposed [9, 24, 49, 50]. Several groups have
claimed to identify ovarian CSLCs [7, 9-14, 50] but
have suggested that ovarian CSLCs are heterogeneous
populations [51]. Our results demonstrate that using the
current definitions, ovarian CSLCs are diverse in terms of
spheroid morphology and stemness status. In this study,
the varying expression levels of CD133, CD44, and ALP,
and distinct phenotypes in ovarian CSLCs from different
EOC cell lines and from the same cell populations reveal
heterogeneity of the CSLC phenotype [51]. This implies
2375

Oncotarget 2013; 4:

that there must be functional and phenotypic diversity
among these CSLCs [52]. In the CSLC model, most
cancers might be monoclonal in origin; however, they
can differentiate into all cell types in the tumor and then
generate intratumor heterogeneity [48]. This phenotypic
and genetic heterogeneity plays an important role in
neoplasia, cancer progression, and resistance to therapies
[51].
A recent report revealed two distinct spheroid types
in glioma stem cells (GSCs), in which the mesenchymal
type GSCs are more aggressive and tumorigenic than the
proneural type [53]. Although these two types of GSCs
possess mutually exclusive signaling pathways, radiation
treatment of proneural GSCs upregulated mesenchymal
markers and downregulated proneural markers, suggesting
the possibility of a transition between different cancer stem
cell populations. The present study demonstrated two types
of cancer stem-like spheroids in human ovarian cancer cell
lines and cancer tissues. The transition between different
types of CSLCs spheroids suggests the important role of
cancer stem plasticity in drug resistance, tumor recurrence
and metastasis [51]. The microenvironmental cues
triggering these transitions remain unknown. In addition,
both glycolysis and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
activity were significantly elevated in mesenchymal GSCs
but not in proneural GSCs, which makes targeting the
ALDH signaling pathway a potential approach for glioma
treatment. The present study demonstrated that ALP might
serve as a potential therapeutic target for patients with
ovarian cancers. However, any differences in metabolism
between ovarian CSLCs and non-stem counterparts remain
unexplored. Indeed, the function of ALP is associated with
distinct networks for cell physiology [31, 54-56]. We have
reported that niclosamide can disrupt multiple metabolic
pathways in ovarian CSLCs to achieve tumor inhibition
[15], supporting the potential of metabolic targeting in
ovarian cancer treatment.
Translineage differentiation is one capacity of
normal stem cells, and it determines the hierarchical
status of cells. The stemness definition of CSLCs remains
controversial [57]; however, they appear similar to normal
stem cells, suggesting that some of the CSLCs might also
differentiate into different cell lineages other than the
original lineage from which the tumor arose. In the present
study, we found that conditional induction could lead
ovarian CSLCs to differentiate into distinct lineages of
cells, although the effectors or mechanisms are unknown.
However, this capability of CSLCs for translineage
differentiation might offer a therapeutic strategy that has
not yet been fully explored [22].
According to a recent study, there is a cancer-prone
stem cell niche at the junctional area of the ovarian surface
epithelium, and one population of normal cells bearing
stem-like properties exists in this specific site [16]. This
finding [16] implies the possible existence of ovarian
CSLCs showing slow cycling and asymmetric propagation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

into differentiated cancer cells, which could be enriched
from the ovarian cancer cell population. Although various
signals in cancer stem cells could be distinct from normal
stem cells, in our study, the SR1 spheroids exhibited
multiple characteristics including a distinct morphology,
expression of the stem-associated markers ALDH1 (data
not shown) and CD133, and slow cycling. These were
similar to the properties of OSE stem cells from the hilum
of the ovary reported by Flesken-Nikitin et al. [16].
We speculate that the presence of cancer tissues
with high ALP expression might imply that ovarian cancer
cells have gained some stemness characteristics and that
this might be related to the high rates of recurrence and
death of patients with such tumors. As for stemness, the
regulation of ALP expression is associated with β-catenin
signaling [58] and epigenetic modulation [59, 60], and
its enzymatic activity is inhibited by levamisole [61].
Levamisole was developed originally as an anthelmintic
to treat parasitic infection in both humans and animals.
In recent decades, the combination of 5-fluorouracil
and adjuvant levamisole (adjuvant chemotherapy) had
been the standard clinical protocol for treating patients
with colon cancers. The therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant
chemotherapy in cancer treatment is controversial [6269].Two independent studies of levamisole in ovarian
cancer treatment have shown opposite results [62, 63].
We speculate that these differences could reflect different
levamisole dosages, dosing intervals or patient selection
in the different clinical trials. Applying newly designed
chemotherapy drugs in combination with levamisole
instead of an outmoded drug such as melphalan [62,
63] and a better design of patient selection in clinical
trials might produce better efficacy in ovarian cancer
treatment. We suspect that one of the tumor-inhibitory
effects of levamisole might be through the suppression
of ALP activity, because knockdown of ALP could
impair stemness properties [70], and this might result in
repression of tumor propagation. More evidence is needed
to justify the clinical use levamisole and its derivatives for
ovarian cancer treatment. We anticipate that inhibition of
ALP activity might present a promising strategy against a
subset of EOCs.
The association between EMT and stemness
remains controversial. The induction of EMT promoted
the growth of cancers exhibiting stemness properties
[35-37]. However, others reported contrary results [42,
71-74]. Thus, EMT is associated with varied functional
phenotypes in different cancers. The epithelial-like
status marker E-cadherin is a key tool for analysis of
the three-dimensional structure of embryoid bodies and
neurospheroids [42, 71]. Indeed, optimal reprogramming
of target cells for induced pluripotent stem cells is
a sequential EMT−MET process [75]. In this study,
E-cadherin was abundant in SR1 spheroids but decreased
in the SR2 spheroids, which suggests an EMT process. It
remains unclear whether differentiated EOC cells regain
2376

E-cadherin expression directly or progress to the MET
to further acquire the stemness phenotype. Our results
support the idea that EMT status is a plastic functional
phenotype of ovarian cancers [51, 76].
In summary, this research supports a plastic ovarian
cancer stem cell model and provides a new understanding
of the cross-link between stem cells and cancers. ALP
was confirmed as a potential therapeutic target for
treating women with ovarian cancers. An immediate trial
of a clinically proven ALP inhibitor may facilitate the
translation of cancer stem cell research to patient therapy.

Collection of each clinical specimen adhered to the
protocol approved by the institutional review board.

Characterization of ALP Activity and Stem-Like
Cell Properties of SR Cells
The ALP activity in parental cancer cells, SR
cells, and differentiated SR cells was assayed using an
Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (Millipore). The
stem-like phenotypes of the parental CP70 and SR
cells were assessed by detecting specific stem cell gene
markers using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) and
immunocytochemistry. Cells were stained intracellularly
with antibodies against human NANOG (GeneTex),
OCT4 (Millipore), stagespecific embryonic antigen 4
(SSEA4; BioLegend), and SOX2 (Millipore), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions as described previously
[15, 21]. The cells were stained with CD44 (BioLegend),
CD105 (BioLegend), CD117 (BioLegend), CD133
(Abcam), E-cadherin (BioLegend), or N-cadherin
(BioLegend)
fluorescence-conjugated
monoclonal
antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry, fluorescence
microscopy, or the DeltaVision Imaging System (DV Elite
System; Applied Precision).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enrichment of Spheroid Cells and Establishment
of Single Cell-Forming Spheroids
The original human ovarian cancer cell lines
OVCAR-3 and SKOV3 were purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA, http://www.atcc.org). The original human
ovarian cancer cell line A2780 and its cognate cisplatinresistant CP70 were obtained in 2007 from Dr. Tim
Huang’s lab (University of Texas Health Science Center,
San Antonio, TX). The cell lines used were tested by the
Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu,
Taiwan) for identity verification by DNA profiling of short
tandem repeat sequences. DNA profiles were compared
manually to the ATCC and European Collection of Cell
Cultures database. Earlier passages of all cell lines were
maintained in several cryovials in liquid nitrogen in
our laboratory. All original cell lines were cultured in
RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with nonessential
amino acids (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen),
and either 10%–20% standard fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Biological Industries) or different growth factors, and
plated in standard cell culture dishes (Corning). To enrich
spheroid cells carrying stemness properties, the original
cancer cells from cell lines or primary culture were
harvested and cultured in ultra-low attachment plates
(Corning). Following the culture protocols for ESCs and
neuronal stem cells, cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with a high or low
glucose concentration, or DMEM/F12 medium containing
0%–5% FBS qualified for use with human ESCs
(Biological Industries) or KnockOut Serum Replacement
(Invitrogen), supplied with or without basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF; PeproTech), and either human
recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; PeproTech) or
2-mercaptoethanol (Millipore), depending on the protocol
modified for different ovarian cancer cell lines or patients’
samples. The cells were cultured in suspension, and
starting from 14 days, the cultures were examined every
day for sphere formation. Spheres were then dissociated
and passaged at least eight times in 2 months to generate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Tumorigenic Capacity of SR Cells
For in vivo tumor xenograft studies of
CSLCs, female nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were obtained from
the Laboratory Animal Center of the National Taiwan
University College of Medicine (Taipei City, Taiwan).
Six-week-old mice were used for the experiments unless
otherwise indicated. The rules of the Animal Protection
Act of Taiwan were strictly followed, and all animal
procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Care
and Use Committee of the National Defense Medical
Center. Various numbers of SR cells and original cancer
cells were injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally
(i.p.) into NOD/SCID mice. Tumor vessels in the tumor
nodule in live mice were quantified after 14 days by
measuring the tumor uptake of the blood pool probe
AngioSense 750 [77, 78] and analyzed using the VisEn
FMT image system (PerkinElmer) [78]. Tumor formation
was observed 10 days after injection. Mice were
euthanized when the swollen abdomen (an indication of
tumor formation) was observed. Tumor nodules were
harvested, and the sections were analyzed by hematoxylin
and eosin staining to confirm the origin of the tumor cells.
Other specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
using specific antibodies against human blood vessels
(CD34; Dako) and stemness-associated markers.

Differentiation of Cancer Stem-Like Cells

Pathology, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei,
Taiwan [21, 46]. Seventy-three ovarian surface epithelial
carcinomas (including 50 serous cystadenocarcinomas and
23 other types of carcinomas) were collected and analyzed
in the tissue microarrays. The tissue microarray sections
were stained with anti-human ALP polyclonal antibody
(GeneTex). To evaluate the histological appearance and
ALP immunoreactivity, two pathologists screened the
histological sections and selected areas of representative
tumor cells for scoring. The methods for obtaining
pathology data for each specimen adhered to the protocol
approved by the institutional review board.

For differentiation studies, SR cells were
dissociated and cultured in standard medium containing
5% standard FBS in standard dishes (Corning) coated
with FNC Coating Mix (AthenaES). The morphology of
spontaneously differentiated SR cells was observed, and
the translineage-differentiating capacity was tested based
on various protocols for inducing the differentiation of
adipocytes, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and neural cells.
SR cells were dissociated and allowed to form aggregates
for 2 days, and neural differentiation was induced. The
cells were transferred to poly-d-lysine-coated dishes and
cultured in common medium containing retinoic acid for
4 days. Neural differentiation of SR cells was also induced
using Neurobasal (Invitrogen), DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen),
or DMEM/F12 knockout (Invitrogen) medium supplied
with B27 (Invitrogen), N2 (Invitrogen), human
recombinant bFGF (PeproTech), and EGF (PeproTech).
Neural cell differentiation was confirmed using
immunostaining with antibodies against α-internexin
(GeneTex) and βIII-tubulin (GeneTex), and pan-neuronal
markers (NeuN, βIII-tubulin, MALP2, and NF-H;
Millipore). Mesenchymal differentiation of SR cells was
induced using a commercial StemPro Differentiation
Kit (Invitrogen). Adipocyte formation was confirmed
using oil red O staining. Osteogenic differentiation was
confirmed by detecting ALP activity using a BCIP/NBT
tablet kit (Sigma) and intracytoplasmic calcium crystals
were visualized using Alizarin red staining (Lifeline
Cell Technology). Chondrogenic differentiation was
confirmed with an Alcian blue staining kit (Lifeline Cell
Technology).

Statistical Analysis
The SPSS software package (version 13 for
Windows; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for
statistical analysis. Correlations between ALP expression
and clinicopathological characteristics were identified by
the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The disease-free interval
and overall survival time were assessed by Cox regression
analysis. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared
using the log-rank and Breslow test. The significance level
was defined as p<.05.

Attenuation of Tumor Formation by Levamisole
Treatment

AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

All NOD/SCID mice were initially inoculated i.p.
with 1 × 106 CP70 cells. Three days after the injection, the
mice were divided into two groups that received either 50
mg/kg levamisole (Sigma) or vehicle orally every day for
21 days. To evaluate the levamisole treatment response
of tumors, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)/micro-positron
emission tomography (PET) scanning was performed
4 weeks after tumor inoculation. The mice anesthetized
with isoflurane were injected intravenously with 250
µCi 18F-FDG and were imaged 30 minutes later using a
BioPET system (Bioscan, Washington, DC).
