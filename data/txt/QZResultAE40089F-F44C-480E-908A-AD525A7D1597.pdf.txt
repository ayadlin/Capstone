BACKGROUND: C-X-C ligand (CXCL) chemokines exert major roles in the biologic aggressiveness of esophageal cancer. In the current study, the authors investigated temozolomide (TMZ)-induced effects on activity of the CXCL chemokine network in human esophageal cancer cells. To the authors’ knowledge, TMZ has not been investigated
previously in experimental or clinical esophageal cancers. METHODS: A complete mapping of CXCL chemokines and
their receptor messenger RNA was performed in 2 established human esophageal cancer cell lines (OE21 and OE33)
and in 4 surgical samples from patients with esophageal carcinoma. The analyses pointed out the potential importance of CXCL2, and monitoring CXCL2 with quantitative videomicroscopy indicated that its biologic activity was
silenced in OE21 esophageal cancer cells. TMZ-mediated antitumor activity was determined in vivo in an OE21 metastatic nude mice xenograft model. RESULTS: The messenger RNA levels of CXC chemokines and their receptors were
similar in both cell lines and in the 4 surgical specimens. CXCL2 depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) displayed
marked effects on the proliferation of transfected OE21 cells. Chronic in vitro TMZ treatment of OE21 and OE33 cells
markedly decreased CXCL2 and CXCL3 secretion. In vivo, TMZ induced significant delays in OE21 xenograft tumor development and improved the survival of OE21 xenograft-bearing mice, whereas cisplatin did not. Analyses performed
on tissue samples from in vivo experiments revealed that TMZ also impaired tumor angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS:
The current study emphasized the role of proangiogenic chemokines in esophageal cancer biology and indicated the
possibility of using TMZ as a clinically compatible drug to impair the actions of the CXCL chemokine network in

Despite decades of effort to improve outcomes, esophageal cancer remains a highly fatal disease. Annually, approxi-

mately 460,000 patients are diagnosed with esophageal cancer worldwide, and >380,000 patients die from this malignancy, which makes esophageal cancer the eighth most common cancer and sixth on the list of cancers that cause
mortality.1 The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with esophageal cancer remains low because of late diagnosis, metastasis, and resistance of the tumor to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.2 Surgical resection as the treatment of choice
remains a matter of debate, especially with modern strategies that incorporate neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy for the treatment of locoregional disease. In fact, >50% of patients still have inoperable disease at presentation.1 A recently updated Cochrane review, which compared preoperative chemotherapy versus surgery alone and
included 11 randomized trials that involved 2019 patients, ended with inconclusive evidence of a statistically significant
benefit of standard chemotherapy.3 It is important to note that most of the standard agents (platines, taxanes, 5-fluorouracil) that have been used, in fact, are proapoptotic drugs and that esophageal cancers are naturally resistant to proapoptotic
stimuli.3-6 Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to combat esophageal cancers that display natural resistance to
proapoptotic stimuli.
Temozolomide (TMZ) significantly improves outcomes in patients with glioblastoma, a malignancy that represents
another example of an apoptosis-resistant cancer that is associated with a dismal prognosis.7,8 Whole genomic analyses of
TMZ-resistant glioma cells recently revealed, among other findings, increased expression levels of CXC chemokines.9

CXCL Chemokines in Esophageal Cancer/Bruyère et al

CXC chemokine ligands (CXCL) are a unique cytokine family that, based on structure/function and receptor
binding/activation studies, exhibit either angiogenic or
angiostatic biologic activity.10,11 Many cancers have a
complex chemokine network that affects the transcription
of target genes involved in cell invasion, motility, interactions with the extracellular matrix, and the survival of cancer cells.11,12 Numerous studies have demonstrated that
CXCL7 is overexpressed in tumor cells in general (for a
review, see Waugh and Wilson13) and in esophageal cancer in particular.14-17 The expression of CXCL12 and its
receptor, CXCR4, reportedly play important roles in both
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma
in relation to lymph node metastasis.18-21 Wang et al22
reported that CXCL1-CXCR2 and CXCL2-CXCR2 signaling contributes significantly to esophageal cancer cell
proliferation and that this autocrine signaling pathway
may be involved in esophageal tumorigenesis. Together,
these data prompted us to seek a reliable experimental
model for human esophageal cancer and to investigate 1)
the importance of CXCLs in the biology of esophageal
cancers, 2) TMZ-induced effects on CXCL expression,
and 3) TMZ-induced antitumor effects on experimental
esophageal cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines, Tissue Samples, Media, and
Compounds

In Vitro Overall Cell Growth Determination
Overall cell growth was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich), as detailed previously.23 Each
assessment was carried out 6 times.
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA extraction, and standard and quantitative RTPCR were performed as detailed elsewhere.24 The primers
that were used, along with the experimental conditions
for each primer, were provided by Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
Calif) and were selected using HYBSIMULATOR software (Advanced Gene Computing Technology, Irvine,
Calif). All primers that were used are listed in Table 1.
The primers that were used for b-actin detection were
as follows: forward, 50 -AAATCGTGCGTGACATTAA
GG-30 ; reverse, 50 -CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAG-30 .
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays
The CXC chemokines growth-related oncogenic b
(GROb) and GROc from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) construction kits (Antigenix America,
Huntington Station, NY) were used in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions for the quantification of
human CXCL2 and CXCL3, respectively. The plates
were coated with 1 lg/mL of capture antibody, and the
tracer antibody was used at 0.25 lg/mL. Cell culture
supernatants were collected after different treatments and
times (as indicated in the figure legends), and multiple aliquots were taken and stored at 20 C until they were analyzed. The results from the ELISAs are represented as
absorbance values. The concentrations of CXCLs are
expressed as picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) and all samples were normalized to the cell count in the sample.
Flow Cytometry Analysis for Acridine Orange
Measurements
TMZ anticancer effects can be induced by sustained autophagic processes,7 which can be assessed by quantifying
acidic vesicular organelles (revealed as red fluorescence)
after acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich) staining.24 In acridine orange-stained cells, the cytoplasm and nucleus fluoresce green, and the acidic compartments fluoresce red.
The intensity of the red fluorescence is proportional to the
degree of acidity and the volume of acidic vesicular organelles, including autophagic vacuoles. TMZ-induced
effects at the level of acidic vesicular organelles in OE21
and OE33 cancer cells were measured by flow cytometry,

The thermal profiles were as follows: predenaturation for 10 minutes at 95 C, denaturation for 30 seconds at 95 C, annealing for 45 seconds at the temperatures indicated in this table, elongation for 45 seconds and 1 minute at 72 C, and a final elongation for 10 minutes at 72 C. The polymerase chain reaction

as detailed elsewhere.24 Each sample was evaluated in triplicate experiments.
Flow Cytometry Analysis for Apoptosis
Measurements
Flow cytometry analyses of apoptotic cell death were carried out by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) technique based on a previously detailed experimental protocol.25 Briefly, OE21 cells were treated with
TMZ once at a concentration of 100 lM and also 5 times
at the same concentration. Control cells were left
untreated. Apoptosis was then assessed by using the flow
cytometry-based TUNEL assay.25 Both nonadherent cells
and adherent cells were harvested, pooled, and fixed overnight (for 15 hours) with 1% paraformaldehyde (for 1
hour) and 70% ethanol. The next day, the cells were processed using the APO-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) kit
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immediately after the staining reaction, analysis was
performed on a Cell Lab QUANTA flow cytometer

2006

(Beckman Coulter, Analis, Suarlee, Belgium) equipped
with a 488-nm argon laser. Apoptosis was quantified by
following the increase in fluorescein isothiocyanate-deoxyuridine triphosphate labeling in TMZ-treated cells compared with that in control (untreated) cells.
Immunofluorescence Analyses
Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20
minutes at 4 C. Fixed cells were permeabilized for 20
minutes by the addition of 0.2% (volume/volume) Triton
X-100 and 10% (weight/volume) bovine serum albumin.
Cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked in PBS
that contained 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at
room temperature. Cells were then stained for 1 hour at
room temperature with a polyclonal antibody against
GROb (CXCL2; 1:75 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). Antigens were detected using
antigoat secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor
594 (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with 10 lL Moviol agent (Calbiochem,

Axiocam HRm Zeiss camera. Images were converted to

Transient Knock-Down of C-X-C Ligand
Chemokine 2 (CXCL2) Expression by Means
of an Anti-CXCL2 Small Interfering RNA in
Human OE21 Esophageal Cancer Cells
The sequence of the CXCL2 siRNA (Eurogentec, Seraing,
Belgium) that was used in the current work was 50 gcaucgcccaugguuaaga-30 for the sense sequence and 50 ucuuaaccaugggcgaugc-30 for the antisense sequence. An
siRNA negative control (Eurogentec) was used as a process control. The antisense and sense strands of the siRNA
were annealed by the manufacturer in 50 mM Tris, pH
7.5 to 8.0, and 100 nM NaCl in diethylpyrocarbonatetreated water. The final concentration of the siRNA
duplex was 100 lM.
Cells either were left untreated (wild-type [wt]) or
were transfected with 3-tetradecylamino-N-tert-butyl-Ntetradecylpropionamidine (DiC14-amidine) lipoplexes
with or without siRNA (negative control: scrambled
siRNA [scr] or CXCL2-specific siRNA). DiC14-amidine
synthesis and liposome preparations were described previously.26 To form lipoplexes, DiC14-amidine/siRNA at a
DNA concentration of 0.4 lM (usually 200 lL) was
added to an equal volume of liposomes at 20 lg diC14amidine/mL in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) while gently
shaking the tube. The liposome/DNA mixture was
allowed to stand for 20 minutes at room temperature
before use. Under these conditions, the lipoplex has a cationic lipid/siRNA ratio of 7.5:1 (weight:weight), and the
charge ratio was calculated as 4.54 positive charges for 1
negative charge. An additional lipid/siRNA ratio of 15:1
also was tested, and the charge ratio was calculated as 9.08
positive charges for 1 negative charge. The liposome/
DNA mixture was diluted in RPMI buffer (up to a concentration of 0.032 lM in siRNA) and added to OE21
cells for 2 hours. On Day 2, each group of cells was pooled
and replated for subsequent experiments. On Days 3, 5, 7
and 9, esophageal cancer cells were scraped into cold PBS
buffer (for RNA extraction), fixed on glass coverslips for
immunofluorescence analyses, or lysed directly in Cellytic
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). The efficiency of the anti-

CXCL2 siRNA was evaluated by immunofluorescence
analysis.
Computer-Assisted Phase-Contrast
Videomicroscopy
The effects of anti-CXCL2 siRNA (vs control siRNA) on
cell viability and cell growth were characterized in vitro by
using computer-assisted, phase-contrast videomicroscopy,
as described elsewhere.27,28 Software that was developed
in our laboratory was used to quantify the percentage of
the area that was filled by the cells over the period of the
experiment.28 Cells were monitored from Day 3 to Day 9
post-transfection. Photomicrographs were taken twice
daily (magnification, 10).
Quantitative Immunohistochemistry
The quantitative immunohistochemical assays have been
described previously.29 For the current study, immunohistochemical labeling was performed using anti-inhibitor
of differentiation 1 (anti-ID1) and anti-ID2 antibodies
(dilution, 1:50) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology followed
by staining with Meyer hematoxylin and Luxol Fast Blue.
The ID-specific signals were evaluated quantitatively
using a computer-assisted KS 400 imaging system (Carl
Zeiss Vision, Hallbergmoos, Germany).
Animal Models
For the in vivo experimental models, 106 OE21 and
OE33 cells were grafted subcutaneously into immunocompromized mice (6-week-old female nu/nu mice
weighing 21-23 g; Janvier, Le Genest-St.-Isle, France).
The potential therapeutic effects from chemotherapeutic
agents were evaluated in the OE21 subcutaneous model.
In the first assay, 5 mg/kg cisplatin was given as an intraperitoneal injection once weekly for 5 weeks. In the second experiment, 80 mg/kg TMZ was administered orally
3 times weekly for 6 weeks.
Tumor size was measured twice weekly with calipers
and is expressed as the area (in mm2) by multiplying the 2
greatest perpendicular dimensions. Each mouse was killed
for ethical reasons when it had lost 20% of its weight compared with the maximal weight gained by the mouse during the experiment. The tumors were removed, fixed in
buffered formalin for 5 days, embedded in paraffin, and
cut into 5-lm-thick sections. Histologic slides were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphologic analyses and vessel counts, as described previously.30 Immunohistochemical analyses also were carried out as detailed
above. All in vivo experiments described in this study were

performed in accordance with Authorization LA1230509
from the Animal Ethics Committee of the Federal
Department of Health, Nutritional Safety, and the Environment (Brussels, Belgium).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica
software (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla) with the Mann-Whitney
and Gehan-Wilcoxon tests.

RESULTS
Establishment of an Experimental Model of
Esophageal Cancer
In vitro, the OE21 model (a squamous cell carcinoma)
displayed higher proliferation rates and resistance to confluence in vitro than the OE33 model (an adenocarcinoma) (Fig. 1B). In vivo, OE21 xenografts also grew
more rapidly than those formed by OE33 cells (Fig. 1C).
Histopathologic analyses revealed that OE21 xenografts
displayed highly invasive features toward surrounding
murine host tissues (Fig. 1D) and metastasized to the
lungs and liver (data not shown), whereas OE33 xenografts did not (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the OE21 xenograft
model was selected for subsequent in vivo analyses.
Determination of C-X-C Ligand Chemokine
(CXCL) and C-X-C Chemokine Receptor
(CXCR) Genomic Expression in Esophageal
Cell Lines and Clinical Samples
The patterns of CXCL and CXCR messenger RNA
(mRNA) expression were determined (using the standard
PCR techniques detailed in Table 1) in OE21 and OE33
human esophageal cancer cell lines and in 4 tissue samples
from patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer
(CS1-CS4). The results are summarized in Table 2 and
include 1 example of how we quantified the patterns illustrated in Figure 2A. The mRNA expression patterns were
classified as ‘‘’’ (absence of mRNA expression), ‘‘þ’’
(expression), and ‘‘þþ’’ (marked expression) for each of
the 15 human CXCLs (CXCL15 is specific to rodents)
and their 9 CXC receptors.10,11
These analyses revealed a similar expression pattern
in the cell lines and the surgical specimens. Chemokines
and receptors for which RNA expression was determined
by using standard PCR methods at least in 1 of the 2
established cell lines were validated using quantitative
RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). These investigations revealed the
marked overexpression of proangiogenic chemokines,
particularly CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 (Fig. 2B). Fig-

ure 2C provides a schematic illustration of the types of

Characterization of a Transient Knock-Down
(Small Interfering RNA) of C-X-C Ligand
Chemokine 2 Expression on the In Vitro
Biologic Behavior of OE21 Cells
Wang et al31 highlighted the central role of GRO/
CXCR2 signaling in maintaining the continued proliferation of esophageal cancer cells. In line with those findings,
our objective was to further investigate the involvement/
role of CXCL2 in OE21 esophageal cancer cells using an
siRNA approach and monitoring with computer-assisted
videomicroscopy. Figure 3A indicates that untransfected
cells (wt) and cells that were transfected with either empty
cationic lipids or scrambled siRNA did not display any
morphologic changes (Fig. 3A, brightfield photomicrographs), and the levels of CXCL2 remained unaltered.
The 2 different siRNA:cationic liposome ratios that were
used yielded similar results. Cells that were transfected
with CXCL2 siRNA (in both ratios) displayed marked
transient down-regulation of CXCL2 between Days 5 and
9 post-transfection (Fig. 3A).
The transient depletion of CXCL2 had effects on
the proliferation of transfected cell, as demonstrated by a
decrease of approximately 50% in the global growth rate
(in terms of cell numbers) of OE21 cells, and the effects
remained after CXCL2 re-expression (Day 9 post-transfection) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, transient CXCL2 depletion had a marked effect on the proliferation of
transfected cells, as demonstrated by a reduction in their
colonization capacity (Fig. 3C).
Temozolomide Decreased C-X-C Ligand
Chemokine (CXCL) and CXCL Messenger
RNA Secretion by Esophageal Cancer Cells
Figure 4A,B illustrates that the repeated (chronic) in vitro
treatment of OE21 cells with TMZ (for 5 consecutive
days) markedly decreased CXCL2 and CXCL3 mRNA
and protein secretion (as evaluated by ELISA assay),
whereas a single (1 day) in vitro treatment with TMZ did
not significantly decrease CXCL2 and CXCL3 secretion.
Similar data were obtained for OE33 cancer cells (data
not shown).
Figure 4C shows that both chronic treatment and
single treatment did induce increases in acidic vesicular
organelle amounts in OE21 cells that were treated 5 times
with TMZ. Figure 4D shows that both chronic and single

treatments with 100 lM temozolomide induced apoptotic cell death in OE21 cancer cells 3 days after the last
TMZ treatment.
Temozolomide Contributes In Vivo
Therapeutic Benefits in OE21 Esophageal
Cancer Xenografts
Cisplatin, a proapoptotic drug that is widely used to treat
esophageal cancers, did not impair OE21 xenograft development or growth in immunocompromised mice (Fig.
5A). Accordingly, cisplatin was unable to contribute any
significant therapeutic benefit in terms of overall survival
in OE21 tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 5C). In contrast, we
observed a significant delay in OE21 xenograft growth
with TMZ using the same experimental model (P ¼ .02;
Mann-Whitney test at Day 63, the last day all mice were

received TMZ treatment also displayed a significant
improvement in overall survival compared with untreated
mice (P ¼ .02; Gehan-Wilcoxon test) (Fig. 5D).
It must be emphasized that, in cisplatin versus control experiments (Fig. 5A,C), the median survival of con-

2010

trol mice was approximately 200 days; whereas, in TMZversus-control experiments (Fig. 5B,D), the median survival of control mice was <100 days. These differences
translate into distinct levels of locoregional and/or metastatic processes (see Fig. 1) with the OE21 model from 1
experiment to another (data not shown).
Temozolomide Decreases Angiogenesis in
Esophageal Cancer Xenografts
Taking into consideration the observed, in vitro, TMZinduced down-regulation of proangiogenic CXCL secretion in esophageal cancer cells (Fig. 4A) and the TMZinduced antiangiogenic effects demonstrated previously
in gliomas,32 we investigated potential TMZ-induced
antiangiogenic effects in OE21 esophageal cancer xenografts. Figure 6A illustrates the significantly decreased
global tumor vascularization in tumors from TMZtreated mice (represented by decreased numbers of blood
vessels in treated samples) compared with control,
untreated xenografts.
TMZ-induced antiangiogenic affects reportedly are
mediated, at least in part, through the down-regulation of

ID1 and ID2 factors in glioma.32,33 Accordingly, we used
quantitative immunohistochemistry to investigate the
expression of ID1 and ID2 in tumor samples from
untreated mice and from TMZ-treated OE21 xenograftbearing mice. TMZ induced the significant down-regulation of ID1 protein expression (P < .05; Mann-Whitney
test), whereas ID2 expression remained unaltered by
TMZ treatment (Fig. 6B,C).

DISCUSSION
A better understanding of the molecular events involved
in the development of esophageal cancer may offer oppor-

2012

tunities to identify diagnostic markers, therapeutic targets,
or prognostic indicators. In line with these possibilities,
Wang et al22 used combinational DNA microarray analysis to identify genes potentially involved in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
reported that primary esophageal tumor tissues expressed
elevated levels of the chemokines CXCL1 (GROa) and
CXCL2 (GROb) relative to their expression in adjacent
normal tissues. The expression and role(s) of the proteins
that belong to this family, with the exceptions of CXCL8
and CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4, has not been studied extensively in esophageal cancer.14-21 The current

Figure 4. The influence of temozolomide (TMZ) is characterized in the OE21 esophageal cancer cell line. (A) Secretion of the C-XC ligand cytokines CXCL2 and CXCL3 was assayed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. OE21 cells were left untreated
(control [CT]; hatched bars) or were treated either once (gray bars) or 5 times weekly (black bars; 8 hours of TMZ treatment
each day with the replacement of fresh medium containing TMZ each day) with 100 lM TMZ. The amounts of CXCL secretion
were measured 24 hours after the final TMZ treatment. Data are illustrated as the mean  standard error of the mean (SEM) values calculated in triplicate experiments and are normalized with respect to the cell counts. (B) Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze CXCL2 and CXCL3 messenger RNA expression levels in the human
esophageal OE21 cancer cell line 24 hours after the last treatment with 100 lM TMZ (once [TMZ 1X]or 5 times weekly [TMZ 5X]).
Three samples were analyzed per specimen, and the data are reported as the mean  SEM values. cDNA indicate complementary
DNA. (C) This chart illustrates the flow cytometric (FCM)-related quantification of acidic vesicular organelles (revealed as red fluorescence) after acridine orange staining in OE21 cancer cells. The cytoplasm and nucleus fluoresce green in acridine orangestained cells. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. (D) FCM-related quantification of apoptosis was determined by using
the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique 3 days and 6 days after the last treatment with 100 lM of TMZ (once or 5 times weekly). Each experiments was conducted in triplicate.

study reveals similar mRNA expression patterns in the
OE21 and OE33 cell lines and in the surgical specimens
and the marked overexpression of proangiogenic chemokines, such as GRO CXCLs (CXCL1, CXCL2, and
CXCL3) and CXCL8.
Previous reports have indicated significant improvements in the outcome of patients with glioma who
received TMZ.7 Therefore, our objective was to assess the
potential beneficial effects of TMZ in models of esophageal cancer, which is an apoptosis-resistant cancer,
because, to our knowledge, TMZ has never been studied
in this setting. We detected notable in vivo antitumor
effects with TMZ (Fig. 5B,D). It is noteworthy that the
delay in tumor mass development was sustained during

Cancer

May 1, 2011

TMZ treatment and progressed after the cessation of
TMZ treatment (Fig. 5B). This effect may have been the
result of the TMZ-induced down-regulation of CXCL2
and CXCL3 secretion that we observed with chronic, in
vitro TMZ treatment, but not with a single TMZ treatment (Fig. 4A). The current results indicate that siRNA
targeting of CXCL2 indeed markedly affected esophageal
cancer cell proliferation (Fig. 3).
It appears that the antitumor effects of TMZ also
may be the result of TMZ-induced proautophagic effects
that overcome resistance to apoptosis.7 Indeed, when sustained, TMZ-induced proautophagic effects34,35 lead to
late apoptosis,36 even in cancer cells that resist various
proapoptotic stimuli, such as glioma cells.7,8

Figure 5. Chemotherapy-induced antitumor effects in esophageal cancer were evaluated in an in vivo xenograft model. OE21 xenografts in nude mice were treated with (A,C) cisplatin (5 mg/kg given intraperitoneally [i.p.] once weekly for 5 weeks; the treatment was started 22 days after the tumor graft) or (B,D) TMZ (80 mg/kg administered orally [p.o.] 3 times weekly for 6 weeks;
the treatment was started 21 days after the tumor graft). Each group included 10 mice. Respective treatment schedules and durations are indicated by black arrows above each graph. CT indicates control. (A,B) Tumor size was measured twice weekly with a
caliper. The area (in mm2 [sq-mm]) was determined by multiplying the 2 greatest perpendicular dimensions and is expressed as
the mean  standard error of the mean (SEM). (C,D) Kaplan-Meier curves represent comparisons of the overall survival of treated
mice versus untreated (control) mice.

The antiangiogenic properties of TMZ may present
a third possibility for the antitumor effects of TMZ in
OE21 xenograft models, which are mediated at least in
part through ID factor signaling.37 The absence of a
TMZ-mediated effect on ID2 expression, although it had
an inhibitory effect on ID1 expression (Fig. 6C), suggests
that TMZ induces vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-independent antiangiogenic effects, because ID2
functions as a master regulator of VEGF expression.37
The combination of TMZ and VEGF-targeted therapy
presents a novel therapeutic strategy that should be investigated for its potential to further improve the outcome of
patients with esophageal cancer. In line with this possibility, Noma et al38 reported that the essential role of fibroblasts in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-induced
angiogenesis was mediated through the release of VEGF.
Furthermore, Ren et al16 reported that human esophageal
carcinomas express and secrete large amounts of macrophage migration-inhibitory factor, which may serve as an

2014

autocrine factor in angiogenesis through its effects on
VEGF and interleukin-8. Hepatocyte growth factor
has been proposed as a useful biomarker for esophageal
tumor progression, because it promotes cancer cell migration and VEGF and CXCL8 expression.17 Finally, it is
noteworthy that, in their review of emerging drugs for
esophageal cancer, Homs et al1 emphasized a growing interest in the effect of angiogenesis inhibitors on esophageal
cancer.
Collectively, our results to date 1) emphasize the
role of proangiogenic chemokines in esophageal cancer
biology, 2) bring a novel proposal for therapy involving
CXCL chemokine inhibition to improve clinical outcomes, and 3) demonstrate noteworthy therapeutic benefit with TMZ in experimental esophageal cancer models,
such as effects on both cancer cell proliferation and
CXCL-dependent but VEGF-independent angiogenesis.
Although several therapeutic agents currently are under
investigation (as monotherapy or multiagent therapy) in

knowledge, no trial has been designed to evaluate the
