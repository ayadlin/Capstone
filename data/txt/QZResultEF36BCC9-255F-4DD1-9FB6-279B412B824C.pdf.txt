ABSTRACT

Here we showed that pAMPKα and PTEN were down-regulated and p-mTOR,
p-S6, p-4EBP1, MMP7, and DCN1 were up-regulated in human gastric cancer tissue
samples as compared to that in the noncancerous tissues. Metformin inhibited tumor
growth in mice. Also it enhanced cisplatin- or rapamycin-induced reduction of tumor
growth as compared with treatment of either drug alone. In addition to activation
of AMPK and suppression of the mTOR pathway, a series of increased and decreased
genes expression were induced by metformin, including PTEN, MMP7, and FN1. We
suggest that metformin could potentially be used for the treatment of gastric cancer
especially in combination with cisplatin or rapamycin.

cell biology [6–10]. The AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase
composed of a catalytic (α) subunit and two regulatory
(β and γ) subunits. Upon energy stress, AMP directly
binds to and activates the AMPKγ regulatory subunit and
stimulates ATP production, leading to energy preservation
for cell growth and proliferation. Following AMPK
activation, multiple metabolic and signaling pathways
are activated. In particular, AMPK regulates the mTOR
signaling pathway, linking extracellular stimuli to
intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell growth,
proliferation and motility [11]. mTOR encompasses two
distinct molecular complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2.
mTORC1 is activated by the PI3K/AKT pathway and
regulates ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis by
phosphorylating the downstream effectors, S6K1 and
4EBP1. Phosphorylated S6K1 in turn phosphorylates S6

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide and is clinically
challenging, especially in East Asia [1]. Although its
incidence has declined in the past several decades,
gastric cancer is notorious for its ability to metastasize to
regional lymph nodes, liver, and the peritoneal cavity. In
addition, it often responds poorly to current therapeutic
regimens and is frequently associated with a poor
prognosis [2–5]. Therefore, understanding the underlying
molecular aberrations and molecular prognostic markers
in gastric cancer is critical to the design of effective
therapeutics strategies.
The AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway has been
widely studied in metabolic disorders and an increasing
number of studies also suggest a potential role in cancer

(40S ribosomal protein S6), enhancing the translation of
mRNAs, while phosphorylation of 4EBP1 suppresses
its ability to act on downstream effectors. mTORC1 is
inhibited by the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Activated AKT
prevents TSC1/TSC2 complex formation, while activated
AMPK stimulates TSC1/TSC2 complex thus creating a
regulatory feedback loop [11]. In addition, AMPK can
directly inhibit the mTORC1 pathway by stimulating
the interaction of 14.3.3 and raptor proteins that can then
suppress cell growth and biosynthetic processes under
energy stress [12]. Aberrations of multiple elements of
the mTOR pathway and their association with tumor
progression have been extensively investigated in many
types of cancers, making mTOR an appealing therapeutic
target for cancer treatment [11].
Metformin is a first-line treatment for 2DM patients,
while type 2DM and insulin resistance are found to be
associated with the risk for development of several human
solid cancers [13–15]. Moreover, prior studies have
revealed that metformin lead to significant inhibition of cell
proliferation and tumor growth. The AMPK system was a
key target for metformin treatment. Activation of AMPK by
metformin results in inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway
and fatty acid synthesis (FAS), as well as stimulation of the
p53/p21 axis [15, 16]. However, other potentially major
mechanisms underlying metformin treatment for human
gastric cancer remain unclear. This study was to evaluate
the effect of metformin in a gastric tumor model system and
to analyze its mechanism of action.

all those proteins was primarily in the plasma membrane or
cytoplasm of normal gastric cells and tumor cells (Figure 1A).
Expression of pAMPKα and PTEN in primary tumor tissue
was significantly reduced as compared to that in adjacent
noncancerous gastric tissue (Figure 1B). Expression of
p-mTOR, pS6, p4EBP1, and MMP7 was elevated in primary
tumor tissue as compared with that in adjacent noncancerous
gastric tissue (Figure 1B). However, no significant difference
of DCN expression was found between primary tumor tissue
and adjacent noncancerous gastric tissue.

Metformin inhibited gastric cancer cell
proliferation and colony formation in vitro and
growth in nude mice
To investigate the effects of metformin on cell
proliferation, we used the CCK8 assay to measure
AGS, N87, MKN28, MGC803, BGC823, HGC27, and
MKN45 cell proliferation after treatment with metformin.
Metformin significantly inhibited the proliferation rate of
both gastric cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2A). Moreover, metformin significantly inhibited
the rate of colony formation of gastric cancer cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). The effects of
metformin on cell cycle progression were further detected
using flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 2C,
the proportion of cells in the S cell cycle phase was
remarkedly decreased in metformin-treated cancer cells
compared with untreated cells, especially in MKN45,
BGC823 and MKN28 cell lines.
To determine whether metformin had inhibitory
effect on cell proliferation in vivo, MKN45 cells were
injected subcutaneously in nude mice and treated
with metformin (250 mg/kg) or saline once daily by
intraperitoneal injection once the tumors reached 4 mm
in diameter. MKN45 xenograft tumor growth was
significantly reduced with metformin treatment compared
with untreated mice (Figure 2D & 2E). The mean weights
and volumes of the excised tumors were approximately
47% and 52% less, respectively, in mice treated with
metformin compared with untreated mice, although these
differences were not statistically significant due to small
number of mice enrolled (Figure 2F & 2G).

RESULTS
Metformin as a protective factor for gastric
cancer patients with DM
Metformin can reduce the incidence and mortality for
certain cancers, notably breast and colorectal carcinomas
[15–18]. However, little is known about the impact of
metformin use on gastric cancer. We used representative
data-sets from Fuzhou General Hospital to assess whether
metformin usage benefits gastric cancer patients with
T2DM (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, metformin
users had a median survival time of 63 months (95%CI:
52.6–73.9), which was significantly longer than that in
non-metformin users (39 months; 95%CI: 30.9–47.3)
(P = 0.028) (Supplementary Figure S1). However,
metformin was not an independent prognostic factor in this
small cohort (Supplementary Table S2).

Metformin enhances tumor growth inhibition in
combination with cisplatin and rapamycin
Given the fact that peritoneal dissemination is
the most common metastatic pattern of gastric cancer
and cisplatin (DDP) is one of the most effective
chemotherapeutic drugs, we investigated whether the
combination of metformin and cisplatin was more effective
for tumor growth inhibition than either treatment alone
using MKN45 xenografts. As shown in Figure 3A–3C,
metformin (250 mg/kg) or cisplatin (4 mg/kg) treatment
alone reduced tumor growth, but without significant

difference from untreated mice. However, weekly
treatments of cisplatin (4 mg/kg) along with continuous
metformin (250 mg/kg) were more effective in inhibiting
peritoneal tumor growth than either treatment alone. The
combination significantly reduced the excised tumor
weight and volume more than 50% compared with that of
untreated mice (Figure 3B–3D). In addition, the abdominal
circumference, representing the tumor burden carried in

and cisplatin-treated mice relative to control mice and was
not significantly smaller in mice treated with metformin or
cisplatin alone (Supplementary Figure S2A).
We have previously shown that rapamycin treatment
alone resulted in inhibition of gastric cancer cell growth
in vitro and in vivo [19]. Metformin and rapamycin
treatment alone significantly inhibited cell proliferation

of MKN45 cells in vitro (Supplementary Figure S2B).
In peritoneal dissemination model, rapamycin alone
remarkably reduced tumor growth, but showed no
significant difference from the untreated group. However,
the combination of rapamycin (2.5 mg/kg) and metformin
(250 mg/kg) significantly reduced tumor growth as
compared with untreated mice. The combination of the
two drugs decreased tumor weight and volume more than
50% as compared with control mice (Figure 3A–3D).
Similarly, the abdominal circumference was significantly
less in metformin- and rapamycin-treated mice than in
either treatment alone (Supplementary Figure S2A).
We next assessed tumor growth inhibition using a
combination of all three drugs in vivo. Tumor weight and
volume was reduced by ~90% in most of the mice and was
significantly less than that in the untreated group (Figure
3C & 3D). Additionally, mice receiving the combination of
treatments had the smallest abdominal circumference among
all the groups. Histopathological analysis of peritoneal
implanted tumor xenograft tissues indicate that mice treated
with all three drugs exhibited significantly less tumor necrosis
than that in other treatment groups (Figure 3B).

suppresses the activity of mTOR signaling. Therefore,
we investigated whether AMPK activation was induced
in metformin-treated cells by detecting the levels of
phophorylated-AMPK at Thr172. Treatment of metformin
activated AMPK in a dose-dependent manner in both
N87 and MKN45 cell lines (Figure 4A). These results
were confirmed in xenograft tumor sections, which also
showed a significant increase of pAMPKα expression after
metformin treatment (Supplementary Figure S6).
To further confirm metformin regulation of
the AMPK signaling pathways, we analyzed the
phosphorylation status of mTOR and its downstream
targets S6, 4EBP1, and P70S6K. Metformin decreased the
phosphorylation of mTOR in a dose-dependent manner
and also reduced the phosphorylation of S6, 4EBP1, and
P70S6K (Figure 4A). Consistent with the results in vitro,
the intensity and percentage of p-mTOR, pS6, and p4EBP1
staining of tumor sections was lower in the metformin
treated group than in the untreated group (Supplementary
Figure S6). These data confirmed that metformin treatment
was a potent inhibitor of the mTOR pathway.
Although the combination of metformin with
cisplatin, rapamycin, or both further increased pAMPKα
expression and decreased p-mTOR and pS6 expression,
cisplatin alone slightly stimulated pAMPKα and reduced
pS6 expression levels, and no effect on p-mTOR and
p4EBP1, while only a minimal effect on p4EBP1
expression (Figure 4B–4E, Supplementary Figure S7).
Collectively, these data suggested that combining
metformin with cisplatin, rapamycin, or both effectively
decreased tumor burden by suppressing the pivotal
AMPK/mTOR/S6 signaling axis.

Systemic side effect of treatment with metformin
or in combination with cisplatin and/or
rapamycin
To assess the physiologic impact of treatments,
blood plasma was isolated from each treatment group and
analyzed for hepatic function (AST and ALT), kidney
function (creatinine and serum urea nitrogen), and glucose
levels. In addition, we monitored animal weights throughout
the course of the study and performed a histologic analysis
of various organs. Weight loss was greatest in mice treated
with regimens containing cisplatin, especially with cisplatin
treatment alone. Significant weight loss was not observed
in the other treatment groups. When cisplatin treatment was
stopped, body weights recovered (Supplementary Figure
S3). No obvious lesions were found in the tissue sections of
gastric mucosa, colorectal mucosa, and kidney specimens
from each group (Supplementary Figure S4). Similarly, no
significant difference in kidney function or glucose levels was
observed among these groups (data not shown). However,
hepatic lesions occurred in both the control mice and the
treated groups, and hepatic lesions were especially prevalent
in mice treated with rapamycin alone (Supplementary Figure
S5A & S5B). Hepatic toxicity, reflected by ALT and AST
levels, was not observed in untreated mice or mice treated
with metformin, cisplatin, or metformin plus cisplatin
(Supplementary Figure S5C & S5D).

Sustained treatment of metformin led to
aberrant expression of invasion/migrationrelated genes
In a global gene expression analysis, we found
that 2025 genes were differentially expressed (1092
up-regulated and 933 down-regulated) at 24 h, while 503
were differentially expressed (280 up-regulated and 223
down-regulated) at 48 h (Figure 5A). These genes were
clustered by expression pattern, yield several distinct
clusters (such as, cell cycle, regulation of cellular process,
regulation of biological process, metabolic process,
etc.) (Figure 5B). According to gene expression patterns
changed in the enriched GO categories, we created a
network diagram to illustrate how these genes work over
time by computing a Pearson correlation coefficient of all
differentially expressed genes (Figure 5C). Our further
analysis revealed that PTEN, a key inhibitor of Akt/
mTOR pathway [20, 21], and CDKN1, a potent cyclindependent kinase inhibitor [22], were up-regulated at
early stage after treated by metformin. However, genes
associated with matrix degradation and tumor invasion
displayed lower expression when treated with metformin

persistently. These genes included DCN, CLDN1, FN1,
MMP7, WFDC1, and UBD [23]. Strikingly, we observed
that mRNA levels of DCN, MMP7, and WFDC1 didn’t
changed compared to control at earlier stage (24 h), but
sharply reduced at later stage (48 h). Together, these
data provided new evidences that sustained treatment of
metformin leads to continuous damage of the ability of
cell proliferation and invasion/migration.
Next, we selected PTEN, DCN, and MMP and
validated their association with metformin treatment in
gastric cancer cells. Levels of PTEN mRNA and protein
were increased when treated with metformin, while levels

of MMP7 and DCN mRNA and protein were decreased
(Figure 6A & 6B). These results were also confirmed
by immunohistochemical analysis on the xenograft
tumor samples, which showed an elevated expression of
PTEN and decreased expression of MMP7 and DCN in
metformin treated groups (Figure 6C).
Furthermore, little is known about the mechanisms
underlying metformin-resistance of cancer cells. In this
study, we generated a metformin-resistant gastric cancer

high-concentrations of metformin. The characteristics of

5784 differentially expressed genes (4449 up-regulated and
1335 down-regulated) in metformin-resistant cells compared
to parental cells. Pathway analysis revealed that mTOR
pathway, ERBB pathway, and key pathways correlated
with metformin-resistance (Figure 6E). We then focused
on MMP7, DCN, and PTEN. PTEN mRNA level remained
high level, but DCN and MMP7 mRNA levels went down as
compared with that at 48 h (Figure 6F). Therefore, long-term
and high-dose use of metformin reversed the expression of
MMP7 and DCN, not PTEN.

incidence increased two-fold for total, colorectal, and
hepatic cancer. However, when patients were treated
with metformin, the total, colorectal and hepatic cancer
incidences decreased to near non-diabetic levels. Other
studies in glioma, breast cancer and colon cancer models
have shown that metformin effectively inhibited cell
growth in vitro and significantly decreased the tumor
burden in vivo [26–30]. Kim et al. [31] revealed that
duration of metformin use was associated with the
reduction in gastric cancer risk in type 2 diabetics without
insulin treatment. Our results provided novel evidence that
gastric cancer patients with 2DM receiving metformin
treatment have longer survival duration than those without
metformin treatment. This result is further supported by
two newly published studies, which have confirmed
the effect of metformin on gastric cancer [32, 33].
However, a multiple-center, larger cohort was needed to
substantiate these results further. Previous data indicated
that metformin exerted its growth inhibitory effects mainly
by activating AMPK, which then suppressed the activity
of mTOR and subsequently decreased its downstream
effectors. In addition to suppressing the pivotal AMPK/
mTOR/P70S6K axis, metformin has also been shown to
modulate several other targets, including p53, p21, Cyclin
D1, survivin and other cancer-related tyrosine kinase
receptors such as HER2 [34, 35].
However, the metformin mechanism of action in
gastric cancer has not been fully elucidated. A previous
report by Kato et al. demonstrated that metformin
treatment inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation in
vitro and in vivo by blocking the cell cycle with decreased
expression of Cyclin D1 [36]. Our results demonstrated
that cell growth and colony formation was inhibited with
metformin treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and
this correlated with decreased expression of Cyclin D1
and CDK4. Metformin also induced AMPK activation,
leading to inhibition of the mTOR pathway, as indicated
by decreased phosphorylation of S6 and its downstream
effector, 4EBP1. These results were further confirmed
in an animal model, which also showed that metformin
effectively inhibited in vivo tumor burden of subcutaneous
gastric cancer xenografts, although no significant difference
was observed between mice treated with metformin alone
and control mice. This may have been due to the relatively
small number of mice in each group (n = 5) and the
inherent characteristics of tumor cells used.
Given the fact that tumor growth was fully inhibited
by metformin treatment alone in animal models, the
combination of metformin with other drugs or inhibitors
of this pathway may be an alternative strategy. Metformin
has been shown to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro
and in vivo in various cancers. Rattan et al. [37] reported
that metformin significantly increased cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity resulting in approximately 90% reduction
in ovarian tumor growth. Gotlieb et al. [38] reported that
metformin significantly inhibited the growth of ovarian

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness
of metformin treatment alone or combination with
the other commonly used therapeutic drugs, cisplatin
and rapamycin, in gastric cancer, and determined the
mechanism of metformin action. We demonstrated that
treatment strategies containing metformin significantly
reduced tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice, and
that metformin caused an increase in AMPK and PTEN
activity and suppression of mTOR/p70S6K/S6, as well as
invasion/migration-associated genes, e.g., MMP7, DCN
and FN1. These results implicated the critically inhibitory
roles of metformin in cell proliferation, tumor growth and
metastasis in gastric cancer.
Researchers have widely studied p-mTOR, pS6,
p4EBP1, PTEN, MMP7, and DCN expression in human
solid cancer tissues, including gastric cancer. Key
proteins in mTOR pathway and MMP7 expressions
were unfavorable prognostic factors for gastric cancer
[19, 24], while PTEN expression was a favorable
prognostic factor [25]. In the present study with a small
cohort of patients, we observed a higher expression of
p-mTOR, pS6, p4EBP1, PTEN, and MMP7 proteins
in primary gastric cancer tissues than in matched
noncancerous tissues. Additionally, activation of AMPK
and PTEN could inhibit mTOR signaling, implying that
pAMPK and PTEN function as tumor suppressors in the
development of human cancer. Our data showed a lower
expression of pAMPK and PTEN in primary gastric cancer
specimens than in the adjacent noncancerous mucosa.
More clinical studies are needed to prove the predictive
role of the above proteins in gastric cancer treated with
AMPK agonists alone or in combination with mTORC1
inhibitors, such as rapamycin. In this study, we evaluated
the therapeutic effect of a combination of metformin, an
activator of AMPK, and rapamycin plus cisplatin in gastric
cancer xenografts in mice.
Multiple retrospective studies have reported that
metformin treatment was associated with a reduced
risk for cancer and cancer-related mortality in diabetic
populations. Lee et al. [18] reported that metformin
reduced the incidence of several gastroenterological
cancers in patients undergoing treatment for diabetes.

cancer cell lines and enhanced the effect of cisplatin
by inducing AMPK phosphorylation and decreas­
ing p70S6K and S6K phosphorylation. Jiralerspong
et al. [39] reported that diabetic patients with breast
cancer taking metformin and undergoing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy had a three-fold higher pathologic complete
response rate than diabetics not taking metformin. Our
data showed a significant inhibition of gastric cancer
peritoneal dissemination when both agents were given
via intraperitoneal injection. Interestingly, cisplatin
resulted in a sharp weight loss, while its combination with
metformin reduced this side effect. Harhaji-Trajkovic
et al. [40] showed that cisplatin treatment triggered
activation of AMPK and subsequent suppression of
mTOR activity in glioma cells. Our data showed a slight
increase of pAMPKα and a significant decrease of pS6,
but no changes in p-mTOR and p4EBP1 when cisplatin
was given. The effect of metformin on these proteins was
not additive with cisplatin, suggesting that the enhanced
anti-proliferation effect of this combination is due to the
augmentation of cytotoxicity of both agents.
Since metformin alone or combination with cisplatin
could not totally decrease proliferation of gastric cancer
cells as determined by a relatively high expression of
p-mTOR and p4EBP1, synchronous inhibition of mTOR
signaling may be important for improving treatment
efficiency in gastric cancer. Therefore, a treatment
regimen containing rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of the
mTOR pathway, may be necessary. Rapamycin treatment
inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth by blocking
mTOR signaling. The results of this study show that when
rapamycin is combined with metformin or metformin
and cisplatin, the anti-proliferative effect was enhanced
significantly in vivo, along with increased expression of
pAMPKα and decreased expression of p-mTOR and pS6.
However, severe hepatic toxicity was observed in mice
treated with rapamycin alone. Considering that untreated
mice also had hepatic lesions, this side effect may have
been due to tumor burden along with rapamycin treatment.
Hepatic lesions were less severe in mice treated with
metformin, although an understanding of the underlying
mechanisms will require further study.
In addition to the known targets of metformin,
we have discovered that metformin treatment resulted
in remarkable changes of genes expression patterns
involved in cell cycles, metabolic and biological process,
and invasion/migration. Among these altered genes, we
found that PTEN responded significantly to metformin
treatment. PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor by
negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway. In
present study, metformin increased the expression levels
of PTEN mRNA and protein in vivo and in vitro, especially
in metformin-resistant cancer cells, which makes PTEN
an effective downstream target of metformin [41]. The
most encouraging findings of our study is that metformin
treatment led to decreased expression of several genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

involved in tumor invasion and migration, including DCN,
MMP7, FN1, and WFDC. DCN contains one attached
glycosaminoglycan chain and plays a role in matrix
assembly. DCN is capable of suppressing the growth and
metastasis of various tumor cell lines [42]. Fibronectin
(FN1) is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes
[43]. MMP7, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) family, is involved in the breakdown of extracellular
matrix in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis
[44]. cDNA array analysis at various time points suggested
that metformin decreased the expression level of MMP7
and FN1 at a relatively later stage, indicating the usage of
metformin must be continuously given. However, when
tumor cells became resistant to metformin after long-term
and high-dose inducement by metformin, MMP7 and DCN
expression was restored again, implying that the dosage of
metformin should be limited in a low level. Given the fact
that the dose of metformin used in vitro is much higher
than that inferred from the plasma levels achieved by oral
metformin intake in human subjects, our data suggested
that continuous use of metformin in lower-dose might
be an alternative strategy for gastric cancer patients with
2DM. This notion is evidently supported by a recent study,
showing that the increased cumulative 6 months duration
of metformin use decreased the recurrence, all-cause
mortality, and cancer-specific mortality rates among GC
patients with diabetes [32].
In summary, the results from this study provided novel
evidences that metformin could inhibit cell proliferation
and tumor growth through targeting multiple key genes
involved tumor proliferation, growth and metastasis, notably
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway. PTEN and AMPK proteins
were frequently inactivated and p-mTOR, pS6, p4EBP1,
and MMP7 proteins were frequently downregulated
in human gastric cancer. Therefore, our data provided
novel evidence that the use of metformin as a therapeutic
drug in combination with other inhibitors and standard
chemotherapeutic agents could suppress cell proliferation,
tumor growth, protein synthesis, and nodal metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissue specimens and patient information
Two cohorts of patients with gastric cancer were
enrolled in this study. Firstly, we screened more than 2,
000 gastric cancer patients treated at the Fuzhou General
Hospital and found seventy-four patients with type
2 diabetes (T2DM). Among these 74 cases, 22 cases
(29.7%) were metformin user, the other 52 (70.3%) were
non-metformin users. Of these patients, 50 (67.6%) were
male and 24 (32.4%) were female; 37 (50.0%) were under
the age of 66 years and 37 (50.0%) were 66 years old or
greater with a median age of 66 years; 10 (13.5%) tumors
were of tumor-node-metastasis stage (TNM) I, 21 of
(28.4%) TNM stage II, and 43(58.1%) of TNM stage III.

Clinical follow-ups were available for all these patients
(median, 17 mo [range, 1–71 mo]) (Supplementary Table
S1). The other cohort contains 39 patients with primary
gastric adenocarcinoma underwent curative surgery at
Changhai Hospital (Shanghai, China) and their tissues
analyzed for the expression profiles of investigated
proteins. None of these patients underwent preoperative
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In this cohort,
patients consisted of 25 (64.1%) men and 14 (35.9%)
women; 22 (56.4%) were under the age of 60 years and 17
(43.6%) were 60 years of age or greater with a mean age of
59.5 years. Thirty-seven patients (94.9%) presented with
adenocarcinoma and two patients (5.1%) with mucinous
adenocarcinoma. Of these, seven (17.9%) tumors were
of tumor-node-metastasis stage (TNM) I, five of (12.8%)
TNM stage II, 20 (51.3%) of TNM stage III, and seven
(17.9%) of TNM stage IV. All patients were followed
up for more than five years. Clinical follow-up results
were available for all patients. All tissue specimens were
obtained for this study with informed consent, and the use
of human specimens was approved by the Changzheng
and Changhai Hospital Institutional Review Board.

Japan). The percentages of surviving cells at 48 h relative
to survival at 0 h were calculated. The experiment was
repeated three times independently.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates in triplicate at a
density of 500 cells per well (N87 cells) or 200 cells per well
(MKN45 cells). After 24 h, cells were treated with metformin
(0, 10, 50 mM) for 14 days. The colonies were fixed with
methanol/acetone (1:1) and stained with crystal violet.
Colonies with more than 50 cells per colony were counted.

Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine
the effects of metformin on cell cycle distribution. Briefly,
gastric cancer cells, grown in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/
well), were treated with metformin (0, 20, 50 mM) for
48 hours. Then, cells were harvested by trypsinization
and fixed with 70% ethanol, and measured following the
manufacturer’s protocol (KEY GEN, Nanjing, China).
Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA).

Reagents and antibodies

Xenograft model of human gastric cancer

Metformin was purchased from Sangon Bio­
technology (Shanghai, China). Rapamycin was purchased
from Gene Operation (MI, USA). Antibodies to phosphoACC (pACC, Ser79), phospho-AMPKα (pAMPKα,
Thr172), phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR, Ser2448), phospho-S6
(pS6, Ser235/236), phospho-4EBP1 (p4EBP1, Thr37/46),
and Cyclin D1 (92G2) were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). PTEN (G6), MMP7 (L17), DCN1 (N-15), and anti-β-actin were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA).

Subcutaneous tumor xenograft models were used to
assess the treatment effect of metformin alone. MKN45 cells
(1 × 106 cells in 0.1mL PBS) were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of 4-week-old male Balb/c nude mice.
The animals were randomized into control and treatment
groups (n = 5). Metformin treatment (250 mg/kg) was
initiated when tumors reached a mean diameter of 4 mm
and was given once daily by intraperitoneal injection. The
control group received saline only. Tumor diameter was
measured every two or three days. At 15 days, all animals
were sacrificed and the tumors collected. Tumor volume
(mm3) was calculated as V = 0.52 (length × width × depth).
Peritoneal tumor xenograft models were constructed
to assess the treatment effect of metformin alone or in
combination with rapamycin or cisplatin. MKN45 cells
(1 × 106 cells) were inoculated into the intraperitoneal
cavity of mice. Treatment with metformin (250 mg/kg,
i.p., q.d.) with or without rapamycin (2.5 mg/kg, i.p., q.d.)
was started 10 days after cell inoculation (day 0). Cisplatin
treatment (4 mg/kg, i.p.) was given on days 0, 7, and 14
along with metformin treatment. Animals were sacrificed
14 days after treatment. All animal experiments were
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Second
Military Medical University.

Cell lines and culture conditions
The human gastric cancer cell lines, AGS, N87,
MKN28, MGC803, BGC823, HGC27, and MKN45, were
purchased from the Cell Center of Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai, China. N87 cells were maintained
in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Invitrogen Corp., Grand Island, NY, USA), AGS cells
were maintained in F12 with 10% FBS, and the other cells
were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cell lines
were cultured in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing
95% air and 5% CO2.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded into 96well plates at a density of 5, 000 cells per well. Twentyfour hours after seeding, cells were treated with metformin
at concentrations of 0, 10, 20, or 50 mM. At 0, 24, and
48 h after metformin treatment, cell proliferation was
measured using the CCK8 assay (Dojindo Kumamoto,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cDNA microarray analysis
BGC823 cells were treated with metformin at a
concentration of 20 mM for 24 h and 48 h and then total
RNA from these cells was extracted using TRIZOL®

Statistical analysis

Reagent (Invitrogen life technologies). RNA purity and
integrity was determined by the NanoDrop® ND-1000
and denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Gene
expression profiling was performed using AFFEMERIX
(AFFY U219). Target preparation and RNA reversion
and amplification were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. For ratio calculation, we
obtained the average of signal intensities of Cy3:Cy5 of
each spot and the ratio > 2 or < 0.5 was defined as the
cut-off benchmark to determine the up-regulated or downregulated genes. Gene ontology analysis was used to the
most valuable genes as previously described [45, 46].

Categorical data were analyzed using chi-squared
tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
survival rates, and the log-rank test was used to assess
survival differences between groups. The Cox proportional
hazards model for multivariate survival analysis was used
to assess predictors related to survival. The significance
of the in vitro data was determined using a two-tailed
Student’s t-test, whereas significance of the in vivo data
was determined using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test.
Analyses were done using the SPSS statistical software
program for Microsoft Windows. In all of the tests, a twosided P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant [19].

Real-time RT-PCR

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Real-time RT-PCR of 3 selected genes (PTEN,
MMP7, and FN1) was carried out using by SYBR Premix
Ex Taq (Perfect real-time) kit (Takara) in the Rotor Gene
3000 system (Corbet Research, Sydney, Australia).
GAPDH was used as the internal control. Relative mRNA
abundance was calculated as 2–∆Ct [∆Ct = Ct (target gene)Ct (GAPDH)]. The primers used for real-time PCR are
listed in Supplementary Table S3.

Consecutive tissue sections (4 μm) of paraffinembedded normal and tumor specimens were prepared and
processed for immunohistochemical analysis as described
previously [47, 48]. Antibodies against pAMPKα (1:100),
pACC (1:200), p-mTOR (1:50), pS6 (1:100), p4EBP1
(1:200), PTEN (1:100), MMP7 (1:100), and FN1 (1:150)
were used to determine protein expression. Sections
were scored blindly by two independent individuals
using an Olympus CX31 microscope (Olympus Optical).
The following values for scoring intensity were used:
0, absence of positive staining; 1, weak expression;
2, moderate expression; 3, strong expression. A mean
percentage of positive tumor cells were determined in at
least five fields of view at 400x magnification and assigned
a value from 0 to 100%. The percentage of positive tumor
cells and the staining intensity were multiplied to produce
a weighted score for each case. The scores ranged from 0
(0% of cells staining) to 3 (100 × 3/100).
