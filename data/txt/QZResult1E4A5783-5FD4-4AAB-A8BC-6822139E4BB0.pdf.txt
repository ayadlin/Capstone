Interferon-a-2b (IFNa2b) is the only effective adjuvant therapy for melanoma
patients at high risk of recurrence that has been approved by regulatory authorities worldwide. However, IFN toxicities increase the risk of poor treatment compliance and impair the potential for benefit from this agent. A review of the
literature demonstrated little recent attention to supportive care in the management of IFN toxicities. An international group of experts with extensive personal
experience in the use of IFNs worked together to develop practical guidelines
for the use of IFNs. Practical recommendations were developed for patient edu-

hen detected early, melanoma is highly curable with surgery
alone. In contrast, patients with more advanced regional
lymph node involvement, or those with thicker primary tumors, or
those with primary tumor ulceration (American Joint Committee on
Cancer [AJCC] stage IIB/IIC/III disease1) are at higher risk for recurrence after definitive surgery2 and should be considered for adjuvant
therapy.3 Although cytotoxic chemotherapy has transient benefit,3 it
has been demonstrated that immunotherapy with adjuvant interferon-a-2b (IFNa2b) produces durably reduced recurrence rates and
may offer a survival advantage in a subset of treated patients.4–6
The use of adjuvant IFN in patients with melanoma is based on
the presumption that micrometastatic disease is the source of future
disease recurrence and is more susceptible to early treatment than
to late treatment.3 The hope is that adjuvant IFN therapy will recruit
host effector mechanisms to eradicate micrometastases and improve
survival in patients with high-risk, resectable disease.
A wide range of IFNa2b regimens, loosely categorized as highdose, intermediate-dose, or low-dose regimens, have been or

currently are being evaluated (Table 1). The only prospective randomized trials that have produced durable relapse-free and overall survival impact have
used high-dose IFNa2b regimens (HDI) and were
conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG).4–6 However, there is no international
consensus to support the use of this regimen. A
meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials of adjuvant
IFNa2b for high-risk melanoma confirmed that there
is a highly significant reduction in the odds of recurrence in patients who receive IFN compared with observation. That analysis also demonstrated evidence
of increased benefit with increasing IFN dose and a
trend for increased benefit with increasing total dose.
The meta-analysis, which included many negative
ECOG trials as well as 2 positive ECOG trials, did not
report a statistically significant overall survival benefit for IFNa2b.7 An updated individual patient metaanalysis of 13 trials comparing IFN with no IFN
reported a small but statistically significant benefit
for relapse-free and overall survival (odds ratio, 0.9
for both) in patients who received IFN. That metaanalysis did not clarify the optimal IFN dose.8
IFN-a therapy is associated with substantial toxicity in relation to the neurologic, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal,
hepatic, and hematologic systems,9 which may affect
the ability to deliver the full course of therapy. In
addition to the controversies regarding doseresponse, to our knowledge there is no international
consensus regarding and little rigorous trial data to
support the optimal duration of IFN therapy, which
has ranged from 1 month (using intravenous highdose IFN) to as long as 5 years.
Improving the ability to deliver IFN may be associated with a clinically meaningful survival benefit.10
The requirement for 1 year of therapy to achieve durable relapse suppression and an impact on survival

is the only possible conclusion from the ECOG E1684/
E1694 regimens. However, more recent research suggests that alternate regimens may have a role in subsets of disease. It is possible that 1 month of
intravenous HDI will prove to be as effective as 1 year
of treatment.11
This expert opinion was developed to provide
practical recommendations for the management of
recombinant HDI-associated side effects in patients
receiving adjuvant treatment for melanoma.

IFN Toxicities
IFN toxicities affect numerous organ systems. Toxicities can be associated with the individual IFN dose
regimen (eg, flu-like symptoms), in which tachyphylaxis describes the phenomenon of improved
tolerance with daily versus more intermittent
administration. Other toxicities are associated with
cumulative IFN dose or with duration of therapy (eg,
anorexia and weight loss). Some side effects are completely independent of dose and duration. Although
IFN toxicities also may be characterized as acute or
chronic, some may appear to some extent throughout treatment (Fig. 1).9,12
The most common acute toxicities reported in
the prospective randomized HDI trials are summarized in Table 2. It is notable that there are substantial
differences between the incidences and severities of
toxicities reported among these 3 trials, demonstrating that, as clinicians gained experience in recognizing and managing IFN-associated toxicities in the
earlier trials (ECOG trials E1684/E1690), toxicities
were managed more effectively, and thus more
patients were able to complete therapy in the later
trial (E1694). The initial trial (E1684) was associated
with toxicity attrition of 26%; in the second trial
(E1690), 13% toxicity attrition was reported; whereas
in the most recent trial (E1694), toxicity accounted
for attrition of only 10%. More precisely, dose delays
or reductions were required in 28% to 44% of

patients during induction and in 36% to 52% of
patients during maintenance treatment in the 3 large
HDI trials, and lower percentages were observed in
the most recent trial (28% and 37%, respectively).4–6
In overview, education of participants in the cooperative group trials regarding the importance of providing supportive care has allowed the delivery of the
full year of planned treatment in 90% of patients
entering study E1694. For comparison, Table 3 summarizes the attrition rates from toxicity for all major
adjuvant trials with IFN given at high, intermediate,
and low dose levels.
Since publication of the results of the last U.S.
cooperative group study of HDI in 2001 (E1694), new
side effects have been linked firmly with IFN, such
as the development of autoimmune diseases such as
thyroid dysfunction that appear to be predictors of
antitumor benefit, ocular toxicity, and erectile dysfunction. Better strategies have been developed to
manage very common side effects, such as fatigue,

and to manage less common, more problematic neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression. Guidelines for dosage modification in patients who
develop hepatotoxicity effectively have resolved this
toxicity, which proved to be life-threatening in
patients enrolled in E1684. Factors that appear to
increase the severity of adverse events are higher IFN
dose, including longer duration of administration,
and patient characteristics, such as age, underlying
diseases, and performance status.9,12

Flu-like symptoms
Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, headache, myalgia,
nausea, vomiting) are acute; they last approximately
1 to 12 hours after dose administration, and tolerance
develops during continued therapy. However, tolerance may be lost with a break in therapy for more
than 1 day. Premedication with acetaminophen,
antiemetics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
as well as adequate hydration during therapy, can
reduce the intensity of these symptoms. IFN administration at bedtime also may be helpful.13,14 Patients
who develop myalgia that is functionally significant
and/or progressive should be evaluated for rhabdomyolysis with creatinine kinase and urine myoglobulin levels.15 Fever >39 8C that lasts more than 1 day
should be investigated, because it may indicate systemic infection. Patients with fever accompanied by
rigors that occur apart from the postdosing interval of
2 to 4 hours or who have cough, dyspnea, or respiratory symptoms should undergo radiologic evaluation
for lung pathology to detect pulmonary infiltrates,
pneumonitis, and pneumonia.
Hepatotoxicity
Mild elevations in hepatic enzymes without clinical
symptoms are common in patients who are treated
with IFNa2b. Because fatal hepatic failure has been
observed, liver function should be assessed at baseline, weekly during induction, monthly during the first
3 months of maintenance, and then every 3 months
during the remainder of maintenance therapy. In the
presence of abnormal liver function tests, patients
must be monitored more frequently. Dosage adjustment is the standard approach in patients with hepatotoxicity.12,16 In addition to IFN administration, other
potential causes for elevated hepatic enzymes during
the course of therapy with IFN include alcohol consumption or underlying disease, such as hepatitis B or
C. These coexisting conditions should be ruled out
before ascribing hepatotoxicity to IFN. Although treatment with HDI is not precluded in the presence of
hepatitis B or C, an increase in the degree of hepatic
function surveillance, including liver biopsy and

involvement of the hepatology service in management
of such cases, is recommended. In addition, patients
should avoid other hepatotoxic agents, including
anesthetics, statins, and large quantities of alcohol,
during IFN therapy. Acetaminophen should be used
judiciously, and patients should be cautioned regarding the risks of exceeding recommended dosages.

Fatigue
Fatigue is a common side effect of IFN and is
reported in 70% to 100% of patients.12 It generally
increases in intensity as therapy continues and can
be very debilitating.11 In a study of 16 patients who
were treated for malignant melanoma with HDI, fatigue, as well as somatic complaints and depression,
increased significantly from baseline through the first
6 months of maintenance therapy and was accompanied by a reduction in quality of life.17
Causes of fatigue may be endocrine, neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, or cytokine dysregulation.
Individuals most prone to fatigue include those who
have a compromised performance status, those who
are receiving higher doses of IFN, and those who are

older. Patient performance should be assessed before
initiating treatment and periodically during therapy.
The baseline assessment should include the amount
of time spent in work or work-related activity; social,
cultural, recreational, spiritual, and/or community
activities; doing nothing; and sleeping. Subsequent
assessments should be compared with baseline to
assess the impact of the fatigue.13
The first step in addressing fatigue is to evaluate
the patient for coexisting causes, such as anemia,
electrolyte imbalance, poor nutrition, depression,
and autoimmune hypothyroidism. Nonpharmacologic approaches to managing fatigue include improving nutrition, alternating periods of rest and activity,
increasing aerobic activity, scheduling more strenuous activities during times of peak energy, and assuring adequate hydration.13 In one series, patients with
a fluid intake >1.5 L daily were more likely to complete HDI therapy (64%) than patients drinking a
smaller volume of fluid (32%; P < .0001).18
In 2 case reports, the serotonin receptor inhibitor
granisetron, administered either orally or intravenously, improved patient performance during treat-

ment with IFN. Performance status (rated on a scale
from 0 [bedridden] to 10 [normal]) increased from 2 to
9 in 1 patient and from 2 to 10 in the other patient.19

Anorexia
Patients who are treated with IFN may complain of
anorexia, weight loss, or early satiety. A nutritional
assessment should be conducted before initiating
therapy to determine ideal body weight, weight history, and eating habits, and the patient and family
should be educated regarding proper nutrition and
techniques to combat anorexia and related issues.
Patients should be encouraged to eat small, frequent
meals; to use high-protein supplements; and to take
multivitamins. The patient and family should be
counseled regarding realistic expectations with
regard to meal preparation, meal times, and changes
in eating habits and food preferences.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms
The most frequently reported IFNa-induced neuropsychiatric side effects are depression and irritability;
however, an acute confusional state, anhedonia, fatigue, apathy, weight loss, sleep disturbances, tremor,
sexual dysfunction, impaired memory, manic symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and suicidal ideation
also are reported.17,20–27 Patterns have been noted in
the development of these various neuropsychiatric
events. Although the acute confusional state develops
rapidly in patients who are treated with HDI, the
depressive syndrome often develops insidiously over
weeks or months. The manic state is observed most
often during IFN dose reductions, pauses in IFN therapy, or as IFN-induced depression is treated with antidepressants.24,28 Nearly all patients develop adverse
effects on memory after 6 doses of therapy.29 Neuropsychiatric symptoms generally are mild to moderate
and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks of IFN discontinuation.21 However, in some patients, neuropsychiatric
side effects can persist for months or even years.29
The best established risk factor for neuropsychiatric events, particularly depression, is the presence of
mood and anxiety symptoms immediately before the
initiation of treatment.28 Other reported risk factors
include dose, duration of therapy, and route of
administration, with time on treatment being the
most salient factor.30 A past history of major depression and female sex also have been implicated, but
their relation is less clear.28
Patients should be monitored closely for the
onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Specific questions should be incorporated into the routine evaluation conducted during each patient visit to allow for
the early detection of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Consideration should be given to initiating treatment
for symptoms (mild) of depression that last
7 days, particularly because it takes 4 to 6 weeks
for antidepressants to achieve a full therapeutic
response.28 It should be noted that, despite significant changes from baseline in depression scores,
patients who are treated with IFN often do not meet
criteria based on standardized testing techniques for
a diagnosis of depression.17,31 The significance of
this is unclear. It may suggest that symptoms
believed to be caused by depression actually are
caused by fatigue or that the change from baseline is
a more important reflection of status in patients who
are treated with IFN than numeric breakpoints for
depression established in other clinical settings.
Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in patients who are treated with IFN, other
causes of these symptoms should be considered.
Concurrent therapy with corticosteroids; progestinreleasing, implanted contraceptives; and b-blockers
are potential causes or potentiators of depression in
patients who are treated with IFN32 and should be
avoided if possible. Reactive depression, brain metastasis, and thyroid dysfunction also may account for
or contribute to depression.33,34
Antidepressants appear to be effective in treating
IFN-induced depression characterized by mood, anxiety, and cognitive complaints.20,27,28 In the opinion
of some clinicians, the risk of depression is high
enough to warrant the routine use of prophylactic
antidepressants or referral for psychiatric evaluation
and management before beginning therapy. Although
there is no consensus regarding the use of prophylactic antidepressants, there is consensus regarding
the importance of involving psychiatrists or psychologists in the evaluation of patients who have a history of prior mood disorders or depression if
adjuvant IFN therapy is to be considered.
In a small, double-blind study, paroxetine was
administered prophylactically to 20 patients with malignant melanoma who were treated with HDI. Symptoms of major depression developed in 11% of
paroxetine-treated patients versus 45% of patients in
the placebo group. It is interesting to note that paroxetine treatment also was effective in lowering the discontinuation rate attributable to neuropsychiatric adverse
events.35 However, clinicians should keep in mind a
potential association between selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor administration (eg, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline) and ocular
toxicity in patients who are receiving concurrent IFN.36
It is also notable that the use of antidepressants may
empower patients who have been too depressed to act
and, thus, may increase the risk of suicide.

Management of IFNa2b Side Effects/Hauschild et al.

Serotonergic antidepressants are less effective in
the management of neurovegetative syndrome characterized by fatigue, anorexia, pain, and psychomotor
slowing.27 These symptoms may be more responsive
to combined serotonin-norepinephrine antidepressants, bupropion, psychostimulants, or modafinil.28
Mania, bipolar symptoms, and mood changes
may be associated with IFN dosage changes, such as
interruption and resumption of IFN treatment.24
Antidepressants should be discontinued and emergency psychiatric consultation obtained if depression
or mania develop.28 Three patients who were treated
with IFN for melanoma responded to gabapentin as
a mood stabilizer. In these patients, gabapentin was
used successfully in the treatment of insomnia and
anxiety, as monotherapy for mania, and for the prevention of mania during treatment for depression.24

Cardiotoxicity
In 1 series of 44 patients who were treated with IFNs
of all types, the most common cardiac events were
cardiac arrythmias (primarily in patients with previous disturbances of cardiac pace), dilated cardiomyopathy, and ischemic heart disease.37 Tachycardia
and hypotension have been reported in 5% to 15% of
IFNa2b-treated patients during the first day of treatment.38 There is no evidence that cardiotoxicity is
related to daily dose, cumulative dose, or duration of
therapy. In many cases, the cardiotoxicity is reversible.37 In 2 cases of reversible cardiomyopathy in
patients who received IFNa2b, endomyocardial biopsy revealed myocardial inflammation.39
Treatment of cardiotoxicity consists of discontinuing IFN and employing standard approaches to
the management of cardiac failure.39 Hypothyroidism
can be an underlying cause of cardiac dysfunction,
and can have a variety of effects on the heart, such
as ventricular dilation, pericardial effusion, and poor
contractility.40 Therefore, thyroid function should be
assessed in patients with cardiotoxicity. Formal cardiac evaluation of ejection fraction and other parameters is reasonable for patients whose symptoms do
not resolve upon conservative therapy after treatment interruption.
Autoimmunity
It has been demonstrated that IFN-a precipitates or
exacerbates autoimmune endocrine diseases, particularly thyroid disorders. Induction of autoimmunity
may itself play a role in IFN efficacy. The ability of
IFN to induce autoimmunity reportedly was an independent predictive biomarker of relapse-free survival
and overall survival in a Phase II study conducted in
patients with high-risk melanoma (E2696).41 Biomar-

987

kers of autoimmunity will be evaluated in a larger
Phase III study (E1694) to confirm the results of the
Phase II research.
In addition to thyroid disorders, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction with disorders of glucose metabolism (ie, diabetes mellitus) has been associated
regularly with IFN-a therapy. Adrenal dysfunction,
pituitary dysfunction, arthritis (including polyarthritis), vasculitis, rhabdomyolysis, and Raynaud phenomenon, as well as rare instances of systemic lupus
erythematosus and bullous skin diseases such as
pemphigus vulgaris, also have been reported.42–49
Most data on autoimmune disorders after IFN-a
administration have been derived from data obtained
in patients with hepatitis C, who may be more prone
to these disorders and to autoimmunity in association with the presence of chronic viral infection.42
Nonetheless, patients with melanoma should be evaluated for antecedent autoimmune disease when IFN
adjuvant therapy is initiated to assure a complete
frame of reference for subsequent follow-up.
The thyroid disorders that are identified most consistently in IFN-treated patients include asymptomatic
increases in antithyroid autoantibodies, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and biphasic thyroiditis. In the
majority of patients, thyroid disease is detected within
3 to 12 months after initiating therapy, but it also may
be discovered after the completion of treatment. The
reported incidence of thyroid abnormalities ranges
from 5% to 31%, but these incidence rates are derived
predominately from the evaluation of patients with
chronic hepatitis C who were treated with IFN-a.
Although it is unclear whether dose or duration of IFN
administration affect the incidence, the presence of
thyroid autoantibodies appears to be a risk factor.
Patients with pre-existing autoimmune thyroid disease
are prone to more severe forms of hypothyroidism
when they are treated with IFNa.42,50–53
Patients should be evaluated for pre-existing
thyroid dysfunction before initiating therapy with
IFN. If hypothyroidism is suspected, then antibody
levels to thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, with or without T3 and T4
levels, should be measured.13 Thyroid autoantibodies
are detected in 70% to 80% of patients treated with
IFNa who develop thyroid disorders.42 Levothyroxine
is indicated in patients who develop hypothyroidism.54 Thyroid dysfunction may resolve when IFN
therapy is stopped; however, some patients who are
antibody-positive at the completion of IFN therapy
may develop thyroid dysfunction post-therapy.50
b-Blocking agents and, in some cases, corticosteroids
may be indicated in patients with destructive thyrotoxicosis. Antithyroid drugs should be administered

to patients with mild Graves hyperthyroidism. IFN
treatment can continue in nearly all patients54 except
those in which thyroid function cannot be stabilized.
Numerous cutaneous reactions, which most
likely have an autoimmune basis, have been reported
with IFN-a.55 Common reactions include a generalized reaction (eg, erythematous and eczematous
eruptions), alopecia, psoriasis (either newly diagnosed or worsening of pre-existing psoriasis), and
cutaneous granulomatous reactions (sarcoidosis, annular granuloma). In patients with psoriasis, exacerbation of the skin disease may be accompanied by
development or exacerbation of psoriatic arthritis.
Psoriatic reactions can be difficult to treat and, if
severe, may require IFN discontinuation.

Erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction and a decrease in libido have
been described in some men who received IFN.
Numerous medications are available for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and may be helpful.
Laboratory findings
IFN-a inhibits the production and proliferation of
megakaryocytic progenitor cells in a nonlineage-specific manner and is associated with hematologic side
effects, including mild thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
and anemia. In patients who are treated with HDI,
leukopenia does not induce neutropenic fever or sepsis and is rarely a cause for discontinuation of therapy.
Hematologic parameters should be monitored weekly
during induction, monthly during the first 3 months
of maintenance, and every 3 months thereafter. With
regard to platelets, both platelet number and function
can be affected, leading to severe impairment of platelet aggregation. This effect appears to be both dosedependent and cumulative dose-dependent, is evident even when the platelet count is normal, and is
present in the majority of patients who are treated
with HDI. Therefore, patients may be at increased risk
for bleeding diathesis, and platelets should be available for transfusion should surgery be required.56
Hypertriglyceridemia, typically without elevation
of total cholesterol, may be present in patients who
are treated with IFN-a. The time of onset is not clear,
but hypertriglyceridemia appears to be associated
with a longer duration of IFN administration. Treatment is with lifestyle modification and pharmacologic
therapy, if needed.57,58 IFN should be discontinued in
patients who develop pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia. The incidence of altered laboratory
test results in patients who are treated with HDI is
shown in Table 4.

* Based on data from 143 patients who received high-dose interferon (IFN) in Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group Trial E1684. Induction: interferon-a-2b (IFNa2b) 20 MU/m2 intravenous daily 5 d
per wk for 4 wk; maintenance: IFNa2b 10 MU/m2 subcutaneously 3 3 weekly for 48 wk (see Schering Corporation, 200262).

Ocular toxicity
Retinopathy (retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots)
or optic neuropathy have been reported in <1% of
patients who are treated with IFN. Retinopathy generally is mild and does not cause visual loss in most
patients. Patients with diabetes and hypertension are
at increased risk for developing ocular toxicity. Ocular toxicity may occur at any time during treatment;
a correlation between dose or duration of IFN therapy and ocular toxicity has not been well established.
Although, in most patients, visual acuity returns to
normal when IFN is discontinued, visual loss can be
permanent.59–61 Of concern, in 1 series of 7 patients
who developed retinopathy while undergoing treatment with IFN, 6 patients had received concurrent
paroxetine.61 In another series of 20 patients who
received paroxetine for depression prophylaxis, 3
patients experienced retinal hemorrhage.35
Patients should undergo an ophthalmologic examination at baseline and periodically during therapy in individuals with pre-existing diabetic or
hypertensive retinopathies. IFN should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders during the course of therapy.
Recommendations
Patient education

adverse events and the availability of supportive management for these toxicities. Educational programs can
reduce the severity of adverse events and improve the
odds that the patient will complete therapy. Education
should be provided before initiating therapy and should
be reinforced throughout the treatment period. It may
be helpful to contact the patient routinely by telephone
during the induction phase and in the first several
months of maintenance to answer questions and to
reinforce strategies for improving patient comfort.
Flu-like symptoms and fatigue make support of
HDI treatment challenging for patients who are
engaged in demanding occupations that require sustained attention, particularly for transportation and
heavy machinery workers, pilots, and bus and truck
drivers. Patients with such responsibilities should be
cautioned against accepting the full demands of their
occupation while undergoing induction therapy. For
others, when the constitutional symptoms of induction therapy and the first few weeks of maintenance
therapy have been assessed, it generally is possible
to resume activities of daily life while continuing
treatment. Recommendations regarding driving and
other attention-demanding activities require individualization based on patient circumstances.

Initial patient assessment and ongoing monitoring
A thorough baseline assessment is required to identify
patients who have contraindications to the use of IFN
(Table 5). In patients who are slated to receive IFN, a
system should be established to assure routine monitoring. Patients should be questioned at baseline and
regularly throughout the course of IFN administration
regarding the presence of side effects (Table 6). Laboratory blood tests, including complete blood count
(blood count plus differential), creatinine, serum
aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, electrolytes,
lactic dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, triglycerides,
and blood sugar, should be performed weekly during

989

the induction phase (Weeks 1 through 4) and monthly
during Months 1 through 3, and these parameters,
along with thyroid-stimulating hormone with or without T3 and T4 levels (and thyroid autoantibodies, if
possible), should be performed every 3 months for
the remainder of treatment (Months 6 through 12). In
the presence of clinical indications, including abnormal test results, these assessments should be performed more frequently. When toxicities are detected,
they should be treated promptly, and the IFN dose
should be adjusted if necessary (Table 7). An important objective of IFN therapy is to maintain IFN dose
intensity so that the patient achieves the maximum
therapeutic benefit from treatment. Therefore, criteria
for dose modification should be followed closely. It
should be recognized that, in some patients, dose
modifications are necessary to maintain safety and to
reduce the rate of IFN discontinuation.

Injection procedures–Adjunctive medications
We have developed general guidelines for management of the induction phase to minimize adverse
events. Intravenous IFN administration should be
preceded by the intravenous infusion of 1000 mL of
normal saline followed by oral hydration with at least
1 L of fluid daily. Premedication with acetaminophen
at a dose of 1000 mg orally and an antiemetic (eg,
prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or a serotonin 5hydroxytriptamine-3 receptor antagonist) is recommended. These premedications should be continued
as needed to relieve symptoms after IFN infusion is
completed. If the acetaminophen is not adequate,
then a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can be
substituted. It may be possible to discontinue
analgesics and antiemetics after the initial 2 weeks of
IFN therapy. Dyspepsia may be treated with a proton
pump inhibitor, and diarrhea may be treated with
loperamide or similar agents.
If needed, analgesics can be continued during the
maintenance phase. Patients should be instructed to
consume a minimum of 2 L of fluid daily throughout
the maintenance phase of treatment and throughout
low-dose IFN administration.
Treatment of elderly patients
Although early trials excluded patients over the physiologic age of 70 years, such restrictions were not
imposed on later trials conducted with HDI by cooperative groups in the U.S. In our observation, tolerance
of IFN side effects, particularly cardiovascular adverse
events, fatigue, and confusion, diminishes with age
and is compounded by the appearance of any component of organic brain syndrome or diminished hepatic,
renal, bone marrow, and/or cardiac function.

The use of HDI for patients older than ages 70 to
75 years requires careful discussion of the risk-benefit ratio given the diminished horizon in the absence
of melanoma. IFN often can be tolerated by the
younger, otherwise healthy elderly. However, the importance of hydration cannot be overstated, because
many adverse events can be minimized by assuring
adequate hydration.

Pregnancy, nursing, and fertility
The safety of IFNa2b during pregnancy has not been
studied formally; however, when it was administered
to rhesus monkeys, it had abortifacient effects at
doses equivalent to those administered to humans.62
In our experience, specific birth defects have not
been observed in children born to mothers receiving
IFNa2b.63
It is unknown whether IFNa2b is excreted into
human milk and, if so, the effect it may have on the
child. However, if ingested orally, it is unlikely that
IFNa2b would withstand gastric acidity to manifest biologic activity in the nursing infant. It has been demonstrated that IFNa2b is excreted into the milk of nursing
mice, and IFNa2b may impair human fertility.62
In conclusion, our focus in the current study is
on the practical management of IFN-associated toxicities, in that adverse events increase the risk of poor
treatment outcome because of their frequent association with dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Appropriate recognition and management of
adverse events allows most patients to receive uninterrupted treatment with the full prescribed dose of
IFN. To accomplish this, the patient should be questioned routinely regarding the presence of side
effects so that they can be identified early in the
course of therapy and addressed promptly.
