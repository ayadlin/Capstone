Abstract
Melanoma development involves members of the AGC kinase
family, including AKT, PKC, and, most recently, PDK1, as elucidated recently in studies of Braf::Pten mutant melanomas. Here, we
report that PDK1 contributes functionally to skin pigmentation
and to the development of melanomas harboring a wild-type
PTEN genotype, which occurs in about 70% of human melanomas. The PDK1 substrate SGK3 was determined to be an important
mediator of PDK1 activities in melanoma cells. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 and SGK3 attenuated melanoma
growth by inducing G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. In a synthetic lethal

screen, pan-PI3K inhibition synergized with PDK1 inhibition to
suppress melanoma growth, suggesting that focused blockade of
PDK1/PI3K signaling might offer a new therapeutic modality for
wild-type PTEN tumors. We also noted that responsiveness to
PDK1 inhibition associated with decreased expression of pigmentation genes and increased expression of cytokines and inﬂammatory genes, suggesting a method to stratify patients with melanoma
for PDK1-based therapies. Overall, our work highlights the potential signiﬁcance of PDK1 as a therapeutic target to improve melanoma treatment. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1399–412. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Using this model, we showed that genetic inactivation or
pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 delays melanoma development and metastasis. However, wild-type (WT) PTEN is
expressed in a sizable fraction (70%) of BRAF-mutant human
melanomas (1, 6, 7), and the role of PDK1 in the progression of
such melanomas is unknown. Here, we used genetic and
pharmacologic models to show that PDK1 plays an even more
signiﬁcant role in the development of WT Pten, BrafV600E mouse
and human melanomas, compared with the Pten-deﬁcient,
BrafV600E melanomas.
Although studies in several cancer types suggest that AKT is the
main downstream effector of the PI3K/PDK1 signaling pathway,
increasing evidence indicates that additional factors are equally
important (8–10). For example, the overexpression of AKT in
PDK1-knockout (KO) cancer cells was demonstrated to be insufﬁcient to restore the malignant phenotype (11).
The 3 isoforms of the SGK family of AGC kinases, SGK1,
SGK2, and SGK3, are also activated by the PI3K/PDK1 signaling
pathway. SGKs exhibit similar substrate speciﬁcity to AKT, and
both kinases inﬂuence the activity of proteins involved in cell
growth, survival, and migration (12, 13). Several studies have
demonstrated important roles for the SGK isoforms in PI3K
signaling in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. SGK1
and SGK3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas SGK2 is restricted to the kidney, pancreas, liver, and brain. Given the function
of SGK1 and SGK3 in cell proliferation and survival, it is not
surprising that they have been shown to be involved in the
growth of several cancers (14, 15). However, their contribution
in melanoma remains unclear.
In this study, we identify SGKs as key mediators of PDK1
activity in melanoma and demonstrate the importance of the
PDK1/SGK signaling axis in the growth of PTEN WT melanomas.

Approximately 70% of melanomas with mutated BRAF also
exhibit the inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN, resulting in constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway (1).
Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), an immediate
downstream effector of PI3K, is a master kinase able to phosphorylate more than 20 members of the AGC kinase family,
which includes PKA, AKT, PKC, p70S6k, and SGK (2, 3). The
relationship between PDK1 and PTEN was ﬁrst revealed by the
demonstration that the lethality of Pten deﬁciency in ﬂies was
rescued by deletion of Pdk1, establishing PDK1 as the main
downstream effector of PI3K (4). Recently, we investigated the
role of PDK1 in melanomas using a mouse model in which
expression of mutated BRAF (BRAFV600E) and deletion of Pten is
conditionally and speciﬁcally activated in melanocytes (5).

PDK1 and SGK3 in BRAF-Mutant Melanoma

We also demonstrate that PI3K inhibitor can synergize with PDK1
inhibitors in suppressing melanoma growth and point to possible
means for the stratiﬁcation of human BRAFV600E PTEN WT tumors
for PDK-targeted therapies.

Materials and Methods
Primary melanoma cells and human melanoma cell lines
Murine melanoma cells Sanford Burnham Melanoma A2
(SBM-A2) and SBM-A3 were derived from primary cutaneous
lesions from BrafV600E::Ptenþ/þ::Cdkn2a/ mice. Tumors were cut
in small parts and digested with collagenase (10 mg/mL; Sigma)
for 1 hour at 37 C and ﬁltered through a 100-mm nylon cell
strainer (BD Falcon). Cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin and incubated
at 37 C. Once established, cell lines were passaged twice before
use in experiments. The mouse YUMM1.5 and YUMM1.9 and the
human 501MEL and UACC903 cell lines were maintained in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin. Low-passage human melanoma cells YUHEF,
YUSIK, YUMAC, YUGASP, and YUROB were obtained from the
Tissue Resource Core of the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer and all cell
lines were used at or under passage 25 as has been described (16).
These melanoma cells were maintained in OptiMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Information on
the genotype and origin of the cell lines used is shown in
Supplementary Table S2.
Activation of the Tyr::CreERT2 transgene
4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) was prepared at 50 mg/mL in
DMSO and 10 mL was applied to the dorsal skin on postnatal
days 1, 3, and 5 using a small paintbrush.
Histologic analyses
Tumors sections were ﬁxed overnight in Z-Fix (buffered zinc
formalin ﬁxative, Anatech) at 4 C. Sections were then washed
twice with PBS and processed for parafﬁn embedding. Parafﬁn
blocks were sliced at 5 mm and sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Antibodies and reagents
The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technologies: pNDRG1, pPDK1, pAKT308, pAKT473, pGSK3b
(Ser 9), pPRAS40 (Thr 246), pFOXO3a (Thr 32), pERK1/2, AKT,
FOXO3a, pP70S6K (Thr 389), pS6K (Ser 235/236), PRAS40,
GSK3b, ERK1/2, SGK3, cyclin D1, PTEN, P70S6K, and S6.
Antibodies against b-actin, SGK1, PKC, and tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 4-HT and antibodies
against S100 were purchased from Sigma. Synthesis of the
PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470 was performed as previously
described (5).

Gene silencing and transfection
shRNAs for mouse Pdk1, Sgk1, and Sgk3 were purchased from
Sigma. Viral particles were produced in HEK293T cells transfected with the plasmid of interest and appropriated packaging
plasmids using Jet Prime (Polyplus transfection). Target cells
were infected with viral particles by spinoculation in the presence of polybrene (4 mg/mL; Sigma). Stable clones were established by growth in media containing puromycin (1 mg/mL;
InVivoGen).
Western blotting.
Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%
SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF), 10 mg/mL aprotinin, and 10 mg/mL leupeptin]. Cell
lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the proteins were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics Inc.).
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 18
hours at 4 C, washed, and then incubated with secondary
antibody conjugated with ﬂuorescent dye. After processing,
membranes were analyzed using the Odyssey Imaging System
(Amersham Biosciences).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Sections of skin and lymph nodes prepared as described above
were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, washed in PBS, and incubated with
Dako Protein Block for 30 minutes at room temperature. Antigen
retrieval for S100 immunostaining was performed by incubation in
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical).
Antibodies were diluted in Dako antibody diluent at 1:500 and
incubated with sections overnight at 4 C. Secondary antibodies
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) were diluted to 1:
400 and incubated with sections for 1 hour at room temperature.
Nuclei were counterstained with SlowFade Gold anti-fade reagent
containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector).
qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using a miniprep kit (Sigma) and
digested with DNase I. cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)
and random hexamer primers, and qPCR was performed on
biological triplicates using SYBR Green. Ampliﬁcation of histone
H3.3A served as an internal control. The PCR primers were
designed using Primer3 and their speciﬁcity was checked using
BLAST. The PCR products were limited to 100 to 200 base pairs.
Primer sequences were: mouse H3.3a: forward, 50 -aagcagactgcccgcaaat-30 and reverse, 50 -ggcctgtaacgatgaggtttc-30 ; mouse Pdk1: forward, 50 -acgccctgaagacttcaagtttg-30 and reverse, 50 -gccagttctcgggccaga-30 ; mouse Sgk1: forward, 50 -cgtccgaacgggacaacat-30 and

Quantiﬁcation of lymph node metastasis
Immunoﬂuorescent staining of S100 in lymph node sections
was performed as described above. S100-positive tumor cells in
the sections were quantiﬁed by ﬁrst scanning at 20 magniﬁcation with the Aperio ScanScope FL system (Aperio Technologies)
and then analyzing cell numbers using the Area Quantiﬁcation FL
algorithm (version 11, Aperio Technologies). The algorithm was
tuned using a preset procedure and the subsequent macro was
saved and applied to all slides.
Colony formation assay
Five hundred tumor cells were plated into each well of a 6-well
plate and incubated for 7 to 12 days. Viable colonies were stained
with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) and the plates were imaged.
The colony numbers and intensity were determined using ImageJ
software. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times.
Animal studies and in vivo experiments
All mouse experiments were performed under the guidelines
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute. BrafV600E::
Cdkn2a/::Ptenþ/þ and Pdk1/ mice were generated as previously described (17, 18). Cohorts of at least 6 animals per group
were used in each of the experimental groups.
Three-dimensional growth assay
Cells were induced to form spheroids using the hanging drop
method. The cells were plated at 200 cells per 20 mL per well in a
Nunc-60 well microwell MiniTray. The trays were covered,
inverted, and incubated at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2
incubator for 5 days. Spheroids from wells containing single
spheroids were transferred to a 48-well plate coated with 1%
low-melting-point agarose. Compounds or DMSO vehicle were
added, and images of spheroids were captured every 48 hours
for 8 days using an Olympus IX-71 microscope equipped with a
camera. The relative spheroid areas were measured using ImageJ64 software.
Flow cytometric cell-cycle analysis
Cell lines were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at 1  105
cells per well, incubated overnight, and then treated with shRNAs.
Cells were harvested by trypsinization, ﬁxed in 70% ethanol in PBS
at 20 C, and then stored until further use. For analysis, cells were
washed once in PBS and incubated in cell-cycle staining buffer (60
mg/mL propidium iodide and 0.15 mg/mL RNase A; Sigma) for 20
minutes. Biological triplicates of 10,000 cells (within the G1–G2
gates) per sample were collected for each experiment, and the data
were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Reverse-phase protein array analysis
The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, then lysed in 30
mL of reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) lysis buffer [1% Triton
X-100, 50 nmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 nmol/L NaCl, 1.5
nmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 100 nmol/L NaF, 10 nmol/L
NaPPi, 10% glycerol, 1 nmol/L PMSF, 1 nmol/L Na3VO4, and

aprotinin 10 mg/mL]. Lysates were transferred at volumes of
25 to 30 mL into a PCR 96-well plate. Ten microliters of 4 SDS/
2-ME sample buffer (35% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.25 mol/L TrisHCl, pH 6.8; with 10% b-mercaptoethanol added before use)
was added to each sample well. The plates were covered
and incubated for 5 minutes at 95 C and then centrifuged for
1 minute at 2,000 rpm. Samples were applied to RPPA slides as
previously described (19).
Synthetic lethal screen for PDK1 inhibitor combination
Interactions between PDKi (GSK2334470) and 45 other agents
were determined in a "one versus many" screen at the Yale Center
for Molecular Discovery. A master 384-well plate was set up
manually, incorporating 4 or 8 dilutions of 45 test agents to yield
a range from 10 mmol/L to 1 nmol/L ﬁnal in the experiments. The
master plates also included multiple negative control wells (0.2%
DMSO vehicle) and staurosporine-positive "kill" controls for a
ﬁnal 10 mmol/L staurosporine. The test agents consisted of 2,4dinitrophenol, 4u8c, 17-DMAG, 4485, atorvastatin, AZD-2014,
AZD-6244, BI-D1870, BKM-120, bortezomib, brefeldin A, carﬁlzomib, cerulenin, EMD638683, EX 527, FASN211, fatostatin A,
FCCP, GGTI-298, GSK650394A, GSK690693, GSK2334470,
GSK2606416, homoharringtonine, metformin, oligomycin,
PF429242, phenformin, piperlongumine, rosiglitazone, SB
204990, SBRI108610, SBRI108634, SBRI108684, SBRI108692,
SBRI108734, SBRI108740, simvastatin, SRT1720, STA-4783, STF083010, T0070907, trametinib, tunicamycin, and vemurafenib. A
total of 750 to 1,000 cells per 16 mL medium per well were
dispensed into 384-well plates using a Thermo multidrop dispenser. After incubation overnight to allow cell attachment, a pin
tool was used to transfer 20 nL of compounds from each well of
the master plate into the 384-well test plates containing cells.
Next, 4 mL of either 0.1% DMSO or GSK233470 to yield ﬁnal 2 or
10 mmol/L were added. Cells were incubated an additional 3 days,
and growth was quantiﬁed by CellTiterGlo (Promega) to read out
ATP accumulation, which correlates well with viable cell number.
Additivity and superadditivity were calculated using the Bliss
independence model and area under the curve (AUC) calculations. To avoid overweighting the high concentration points, the
natural log concentrations are used to calculate AUC. AUC calculation is performed using the function "auc" from the R library
"MESS," using the linear type option. This function approximates
the area under a set of points by summing the trapezoidal
segments between adjacent points. Normalization of the AUC
calculation is performed by dividing the calculated AUC by the
width of the log concentration range for each plated agent to
correct for differences in concentration ranges.
Statistical analysis
All data except survival curves were analyzed by the unpaired t
test. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compiled using Prism
software (GraphPad) and statistical signiﬁcance was assessed
using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Pdk1/ (PDK1 KO) mice systemically treated with 4-HT on
postnatal days 1, 3, and 5 exhibited markedly reduced pigmentation on day 21 after 4-HT administration compared with
similarly treated BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/::Pdk1þ/þ (Pdk1 WT) mice
(Fig. 1A and B). Consistent with these observations, heavy pigmentation and melanomagenesis was observed in the skin (Fig.
1C) and lymph nodes (Fig. 1D) of PDK1 WT mice whereas it was
signiﬁcantly reduced in the PDK1 KO mice. Examination of mice
on day 38 after 4-HT administration revealed that 7 of 12 (40%)
PDK1 WT mice contained tumors, whereas tumors were undetectable in the PDK1 KO mice (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the mean
survival time of the PDK1 KO mice was signiﬁcantly prolonged
compared with that of the PDK1 WT mice (76 vs. 42 days; P <
0.001; Fig. 1F). Notably, only a single administration of 4-HT was
required to observe the effects of PDK1 deletion on melanomagenesis in the BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/ animals (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Under these conditions, tumor development was
delayed (50 days) but still markedly reduced in the PDK1 KO
(2 of 8 mice) compared with the PDK1 WT (12/14 mice) mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/ were conﬁrmed by immunohistochemical and immunoﬂuorescent evaluation of the skin. Consistent
with these effects, we observed the presence of signiﬁcantly
reduced pigmented, hyperproliferative foci within the skin
sections (Fig. 1G) and lymph nodes (Fig. 1I) from Pdk1 KO
compared with Pdk1 WT mice. Similarly, immunoﬂuorescence
staining for S100, a marker for both melanotic and amelanotic melanomas, revealed substantially more tumor cells
within the skin (Fig. 1H) and more extensive invasion of the
lymph nodes (Fig. 1J) of Pdk1 WT compared with Pdk1 KO
mice.

We next investigated some of the key signal transduction
pathways regulated by PDK1. For this, we established earlypassage (1–2) cell cultures of tumors from BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/

::Ptenþ/þ::Pdk1/ and BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/::Ptenþ/þ::Pdk1þ/þ
mice, which enabled the analysis of AGC kinase pathway components. As expected, the absence of PDK1 resulted in a marked
reduction in the phosphorylation of downstream target proteins
such as AKT, FOXO3a, GSK3b, PRAS40, RSK, p70S6K, and the
SGK1 substrate NDRG1 (Fig. 1K).
Collectively, these data establish that PDK1 plays an important
role in the development of melanoma in BrafV600E/WT Pten mice,
in addition to its reported role in the BrafV600E mice in which Pten
is inactivated or deleted.
SGK1 and SGK3 are key mediators of PDK1-dependent
melanomagenesis
The results shown above identify several potential PDK1 substrates that might be required for melanoma development in Pdk1
WT mice, including the transcription factor FOXO3a, which was
also identiﬁed in our earlier study (5). Notably, FOXO3a is
regulated by phosphorylation of the same phosphoacceptor sites
by either AKT or SGK. To determine whether SGK1 or SGK3 plays a
role in PDK1-dependent melanoma development, we performed
shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of Pdk1, Sgk1, or Sgk3 in
two melanoma lines each derived from BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/::
Pten/ mice (lines YUMM1.5 and YUMM1.9) and BrafV600E::
Cdkn2a/::Ptenþ/þ mice (lines SBM-A2 and SBM-A3) and examined the effects of KD on the expression and phosphorylation of
key PDK1 signaling components (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S2A–S2D). As expected, the degree of AKT, FOXO3a, and
PRAS40 phosphorylation was notably lower in the PTEN WT
tumor cells, reﬂecting PTEN activity (Fig. 2A). The degree of the

PDK1 and SGK3 in BRAF-Mutant Melanoma

KD for Pdk1, Sgk1 and Sgk3 was largely efﬁcient (Supplementary
Fig. S2A–S2D). PDK1 KD effectively attenuated phosphorylation
of FOXO3a, NDRG1, S6, P70S6K, and 4EBP1 in both Pten WT and
mutant cell lines (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2E). In contrast,
KD of Sgk1 abolished phosphorylation of NDRG1 but had minimal effects on p70S6K, FOXO3a, PRAS40, and 4EBP1 and KD of
Sgk3 reduced phosphorylation of 4EBP1, P70S6K, and S6 but had
no effect on NDRG1 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Consistent with recent reports that SGK3 and p70S6K regulate
cyclin D1 expression and cell growth (20), we observed reduced
cyclin D1 expression after KD of PDK1 and SGK3 but not KD of
SGK1 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2E). The effects of SGK3 KD
on p70S6K phosphorylation and cyclin D1 protein expression in
melanoma cells were conﬁrmed using an independent Sgk3-specﬁc
shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2G). These results demonstrate that
the effects of PDK1 inhibition are closely mimicked by SGK3
inhibition, raising the possibility that this protein might mediate
the effects of PDK1 on growth of mutant Braf, Pten WT melanomas.
To test this further, we examined colony formation and 3dimensional (3D) growth of YUMM1.5 (Pten/) and SBM-A2
(Ptenþ/þ) cell lines expressing control or Pdk1-, Sgk1-, and Sgk3targeted shRNA. We found that clonal growth was virtually
abolished by KD of Pdk1 or Sgk3 but minimally affected by Sgk1
KD (Fig. 2C, Fig. 2D). Notably, KD of all 3 proteins reduced
melanoma sphere formation and growth to some extent, with
Pdk1 KD the most effective (90% inhibition vs. cells expressing
scrambled shRNA), followed by Sgk3 KD (70% inhibition) and
Sgk1 KD (55% inhibition; Fig. 2E). These effects were conﬁrmed
using independent Sgk1- or Sgk3-targeted shRNAs (50% inhibition of sphere formation over 7 days; Supplementary Fig. S2F,
S2H, and S2I). These data demonstrate that SGK3 inhibition
effectively inhibits colony formation and 3D growth of BRAFV600E
PTEN WT and PTEN-null melanomas.
Pharmacologic inhibition of SGK3 inhibits melanoma cell
growth
We next asked whether pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 and
SGK would phenocopy the genetic inactivation with shRNA. To
this end, we treated the BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/::Pten/ and
BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/::Ptenþ/þ cell cultures with either the SGK
inhibitor (SGKi) GSK650394 (21) or the PDK1 inhibitor (PDK1i)
GSK2334470 (22) for 24 hours and then examined PDK1-dependent signaling pathway components. Conﬁrming the expected
effects, PDK1i reduced the phosphorylation of all of its downstream components, whereas SGKi reduced NDRG1 and S6
phosphorylation but did not affect the upstream components
FOXO3a and PRAS40 (Fig. 3A). We next examined the effects of
pharmacologic SGKi on sphere formation of YUMM1.5 cells
incubated with the PDK1i and SGKi. Both inhibitors were effective and essentially abolished sphere formation at high concen-

trations, whereas the effect of PDK1i was more pronounced at
lower concentrations (Fig. 3B and C). These results suggest that
the role of PDK1 in melanoma growth is mediated, at least in part,
by SGK.
Inhibition of SGK3 or PDK1 causes melanoma cell-cycle arrest
at G1
To determine the mechanism(s) by which genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SGK3 suppresses melanoma growth, we
performed FACS analysis to determine the proportion of cells
in each phase of the cell cycle after KD of PDK1 or SGK3. We
found that the expression of either shSgk3 or shPdk1 led to the
accumulation of BrafV600E::Cdkn2a/::Pten/ and BrafV600E::
Cdkn2a/::Ptenþ/þ cells in G1 (Fig. 4), and this ﬁnding was
conﬁrmed using an independent Sgk3-speciﬁc shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results indicate that the observed changes
in cell growth following the inhibition of SGK3 and PDK1 activity
are attributed to cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase.
PDK1 inhibition synergizes with proteasome and PI3K/mTOR
inhibition to attenuate melanoma growth
Combination therapies are often more potent inhibitors of
tumor growth and can also suppress the growth of tumors
resistant to the individual therapies. Therefore, we next screened
for pharmacologic inhibitors that might act synergistically with
PDK1i in suppressing melanoma growth. For this, we tested the
PDK1 inhibitor (GSK2334470) in combination with 45 known
inhibitors, including modulators of MAPK and PI3K activity,
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, metabolic stress, and of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 5A). To ensure coverage of multiple
subtypes, we tested melanoma lines including BRAF mutant,
HRAS mutant, NRAS mutant, and WT for BRAF, HRAS, and NRAS.
Cell growth was analyzed after treatment with 2 or 10 mmol/L of
the PDK1 inhibitor over a broad range of doses of the second
agent (Supplementary Fig. S4). Determination of synergy was
made by monitoring inhibition of combination therapy minus
Bliss additivity of individual agent responses. This assessment
revealed that 50% greater effect was identiﬁed compared with
what would have been predicted by additivity in 24 conditions.
Among the compounds showing potent synergistic activity
with GSK2334470 in suppressing growth were the pan-PI3K
inhibitor BKM120 and the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib
and carﬁlzomib (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S4). In agreement with the effects on cell growth, we found that the addition of
1 or 4 nmol/L bortezomib further inhibited phosphorylation of
key PDK1 substrates compared with inhibition of PDK1 alone
(AKT, FOXO3a, and S6 phosphorylation compared with PDK1
inhibition alone; Fig. 5B) and concomitantly further activated ER
stress (ATF4 and CHOP induction) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and PARP; Fig. 5B). A similar synergistic effect of the PDK1i

PDK1 and SGK3 in BRAF-Mutant Melanoma

and bortezomib was observed with the human melanoma cell
lines UACC903 and Mel501, although the degree of caspase-3
cleavage was not detectable in the UACC903 cells, possibly due to
the higher level of AKT in these cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, the
synergistic effect on apoptosis of YUMM1.5 cells following cotreatment of bortezomib and PDK1 inhibitors was seen in 3D
cultures only when higher concentrations of bortezomib were
administered (200 nmol/L in 3D cultures, compared with 4
nmol/L in the 2D cultures; Fig. 5C). The latter might be attributed
to the higher expression of antiapoptotic genes in cells grown in
3D cultures, as previously reported for lung cancer cells and
mesothelioma cell lines (23, 24).
The pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 (25, 26) was also found to
synergize with the PDK1i in reducing AKT, FOXO3a, PRAS40,
and GSK3b phosphorylation in both the PTEN WT and mutant
melanoma cells (Fig. 6A). Notably, the combination of
BKM120 with PDK1i induced cell death in the PTEN WT but
not in the PTEN-mutant melanoma cells, measured by cleaved
caspase-3 levels (Fig. 6A). Nevertheless, the combination of
BKM120 and PDK1i attenuated cell growth in the PTENmutant melanoma cells, as reﬂected by the reduced expression
of cyclin D1 (Fig. 6A). These observations indicated that the
response of melanoma cells to combined inhibition of PI3K/
PDK1 depends on the degree of PTEN/AKT signaling and
determines the susceptibility to undergo cytostatic or cytotoxic
response.
We have further assessed the effect of the PDKi and BKM120
combination on human melanoma harboring PTEN WT or
mutant genotypes. Consistent with the ﬁnding in the mouse
melanoma lines, this combination was effective in inhibiting
the key AKT/PDK1 signaling in both melanoma lines, albeit
with greater effectiveness on the PTEN WT–derived cells.
Cell death program, monitored by caspase-3 cleavage, was
induced in the Pten WT (SBM-A2 and Mel501) but not Ptenmutant (YUMM1.5 and UACC903) melanomas by the
BKM120 and PDK1i inhibitor combination (Fig. 6B). When
assessed in 3D growth, this combination elicited cytostatic
effect, limiting, albeit signiﬁcantly, the growth of these tumors
cells (Fig. 6C).
The combined effect of PDK1 and PI3K inhibitors on the
human melanoma cell lines UACC903 was analyzed by RPPA
using a panel of 172 antibodies directed to components of
major signaling pathways (19, 27). This analysis revealed that
combined PDK1 and PI3K inhibition elicited an additive effect,
which was reﬂected in the degree of decreased phosphorylation
of key components along the PDK1 pathway, including S6,
AKT, p70S6K, as well as tuberin, mTOR, and GSK3b, pointing
to effect of this combination also on mTOR and GSK3 pathways (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. 5A, and Supplementary
Fig. S5).
These ﬁndings points for the effectiveness of combined PI3K/
PDK1 inhibition, which attenuates the growth of melanoma cells,
with a notably greater effect on the PTEN WT cultures.

Stratiﬁcation of melanoma to PDK1 inhibition
To determine whether sensitivity of melanoma to PDK1i is
associated with a speciﬁc gene signature, we assessed the effects of
PDK1i on 19 melanoma cell lines for which gene expression and
genomic mutation data are available. The PDK1i 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) for cell growth and 50% effective concentration (EC50) were used to segregate the cell lines (Fig. 7A). The
seven most resistant (UACC1940, 2994, 2512, 1120, 1118, 558,
and 2641) and the seven most sensitive (UACC903, 2331, 612,
2496, 647, 952, and 3337) cell lines were then selected for
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify the genes and pathways most signiﬁcantly affected by PDK1i (P < 0.05). This analysis
identiﬁed 1,178 differentially expressed genes, including multiple
components of the TIF2 nuclear co-regulator and mTOR signaling
pathways that were speciﬁcally associated with sensitivity to
PDK1i. Further reﬁnement of this assessment to include only
genes showing 10-fold differential expression clearly distinguished 2 clusters of genes associated with sensitivity and resistance to PDK1i (Fig. 7B). Sensitivity to PDK1i was associated with
the reduced expression of several pigmentation genes (DCT,
PMEL, MelanA) and elevation of number of cytokines and immunomodulators, including IL8, IL1B, IL6, Serpin1, Serpin2, and
PDGF (Fig. 7B). These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by qPCR.
PDK1i-treated YUMM1.5 cells showed a reduction in DCT and
TYR mRNA and an increase in IL6 mRNA compared with untreated cells (Fig. 7C). Consistent with these results, canonical pathway
analysis showed that sensitivity of melanoma cells to PDK1i was
associated with decreased expression of MITF, the key upstream
regulator of pigmentation genes (P ¼ 1.6E-18). Integrin signaling
genes were also strongly associated with PDK1i sensitivity (P ¼
7.1E-4). Analysis of mRNA levels conﬁrmed reduced expression of
Tyr and Dct, 2 pigmentation genes in both Pten WT and mutant
melanoma cells derived from the Pdk1 KD tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6). Likewise, lack of Pdk1 in these melanomas also
attenuated the expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT)-related genes (28), Zeb1 and Mmp3 (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Analysis of 3 melanoma lines revealed slight differences
(i.e., effect on Tyr level in YUMM1.9 and on MMP3 in YUMM1.5
cells was limited, compared with changes seen in the other 2
cultures), pointing to heterogeneity among the cell types used
here. These ﬁndings points to a number of genes that could be
further explored as markers for the stratiﬁcation of patients with
melanoma for therapy by PDK1 inhibition.

Discussion
A number of pathways are known to contribute to melanoma
development and progression, including the MAPK signaling
pathway, which is deregulated in more than 70% of melanomas
(NRAS and BRAF mutations), and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is deregulated in more than 50% of these tumors,
in part due to genetic mutations and in part due to altered
post translational modiﬁcations (29, 30). Using genetic and pharmacologic inhibitors, we previously demonstrated the importance

those ﬁndings to show that PDK1 also plays an important role in
melanomas harboring WT PTEN, which includes about 70% of

PDK1 and SGK3 in BRAF-Mutant Melanoma

components. Together, our ﬁndings further our appreciation
for the impact of PDK1 to the AGC kinase landscape.
The signiﬁcance of our observations is highlighted in synthetic lethal screens by the identiﬁcation of pan-PI3K inhibitor
that effectively synergize with PDK1i, particularly in PTEN
WT melanomas, suggesting that the focused targeting of the
PI3K–PDK1 signaling axis might represent a novel therapeutic
modality for PTEN WT melanomas. A similar approach with
combination MEKi and BRAFi has produced promising results
in ongoing clinical trials (31). Notably, our data point to a gene
signature that distinguishes between PDK1i-sensitive melanomas (which express low levels of pigmentation genes associated
with MITF signaling) and PDK1i-resistant melanomas (which
express inﬂammation-related genes, including IL6 and IL3);
this signature could potentially be used for the stratiﬁcation of
patients for PDK1-targeted therapies. Given the recent ﬁnding
that low MITF expression correlates with resistance of melanomas to BRAFi (32), it would be of interest to further examine
the possibility that targeting the PDK1 pathway might also be
efﬁcient for inhibiting the resistance phenotype. Notably,
PDK1-deﬁcient melanomas also exhibited reduced ZEB1 and
MMP3 expression, pointing to PDK1 role in control of the EMT,
explaining the reduced metastasis observed in vivo and attenuated growth in 3D in culture. Of interest, our results reveal that
inhibition of either PDK1 or SGK3 decreased the phosphorylation of 4-EBP1, pointing to possible role of these AGC kinases
in the regulation of CAP-dependent translation. Consistent
with these observations, eIF4F, another component of this
translation initiation complex, was recently linked with the
resistance to anti-BRAF and anti-MEK therapies in BRAF-mutant
melanoma, colon, and thyroid cancer cells (33).
PDK1 inhibitors that are suitable for use in clinical trials have
not yet been developed. Although the PDK1i used in our study
(GSK2334470) is quite speciﬁc and exhibits excellent properties
for work with cultured cells (22, 34), it is unsuitable for further
preclinical or clinical development. Other PDK1 inhibitors are
currently being developed, which might exhibit acceptable safety
proﬁles and be eligible for further advanced clinical evaluation.
An alternative approach to inhibiting PDK1 is to identify and
target one or more downstream PDK1 substrates that are crucial
for melanoma development and progression. In this regard, we
report here that the genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of
SGK3 largely phenocopies the effects of PDK1 inhibition on
melanoma cells, including growth arrest in G1 phase. Our ﬁndings
are consistent with earlier reports that pointed to the role of SGK3
in melanoma (8).
The repertoire of potential targets for melanoma therapy is
expanding considerably, thanks in large part to the extensive

knowledge gained from mechanistic and clinical studies. As a
result, future clinical management options will be more extensive
and are likely to include modulators of pathways that are independent of the MAPK signaling axis. Our data substantiate the
importance of PDK1 and one of its downstream substrates, SGK3,
for melanoma development and progression and further suggest
that inhibitors of this signaling pathway might be useful for the
development of clinical management options for melanoma.
