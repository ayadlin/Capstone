ABSTRACT:
Agents that target B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in lymphoid malignancies
including idelalisib (GS-1101) and fostamatinib which inhibit the delta isoform of PI3
kinase (PI3Kd) and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) respectively have shown significant
clinical activity. By disrupting B-cell signaling pathways, idelalisib treatment has
been associated with a dramatic lymph node response, but eradication of disease and
relapse in high risk disease remain challenges. Targeting the BCR signaling pathway
with simultaneous inhibition of PI3Kd and Syk has not yet been reported. We evaluated
the pre-clinical activity of idelalisib combined with the novel and selective Syk
inhibitor GS-9973 in primary peripheral blood and bone marrow Chronic Lymphocytic
Leukemia (CLL) samples. Both PI3Kd and Syk inhibition reduced CLL survival and in
combination induced synergistic growth inhibition and further disrupted chemokine
signaling at nanomolar concentrations including in bone marrow derived and poor
risk samples. Simultaneous targeting of these kinases may significantly increase
clinical activity.

INTRODUCTION

cell-microenvironment interactions [3,4]. Treatment of
primary CLL cells with idelalisib (GS-1101), ibrutinib,
and fostamatinib (R406) which inhibit the PI3 kinase
delta-specific isoform (PI3Kd), Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
(Btk) and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) respectively, results
in inhibition of BCR signaling pathways, decreased cell
proliferation, and disruption of chemokine mediated CLL
cell migration [5],[6],[7],[8]. These agents are orally
bioavailable and have been evaluated in early phase
trials in relapsed and refractory CLL patients. Although
significant clinical activity has been observed in patients
treated with these drugs as single agents, complete
remission rates are low and marrow disease may be
difficult to eradicate. Furthermore, although response

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains
incurable with standard therapies [1]. Increasingly it
has been recognized that CLL cell survival is dependent
on the complex interactions of neoplastic cells with
the microenvironment. Specifically, cell proliferation
is mediated by multiple inputs such as B-cell receptor
(BCR) signaling pathways, chemokines, cytokines,
integrins, nurse-like cells, BAFF, and CD40 [2]. A
number of therapeutic agents have been developed
including small molecules that inhibit these key
signaling pathways including agents that target BCRmediated kinase signaling pathways and disrupt CLL

rates with monotherapy do not appear to be adversely
affected by the presence of poor risk disease, responses are
significantly less durable in this population [9, Brown J.R.
et al. J Clin Oncolo 31, 2013 (supple;abstr 7003)]. Thus
new therapeutic approaches that evaluate these agents in
combination are warranted.
Currently, little is known about the effects of
inhibiting multiple nodes in the BCR pathway. Feedback
loops and cross talk between signaling pathways may
significantly impact the efficacy of cancer therapeutics
and drive resistance to single agent therapy. Combination
therapy to address the molecular complexity associated
with the convergence of B-Cell signaling pathways could
provide a novel treatment approach. Inhibition of multiple
B-cell signaling pathways and simultaneous inhibition
of the BCR signaling pathway may have the potential
for synergy and implications for overcoming resistance
to single agents or eradicating minimal residual disease
(MRD) the latter of which has been shown to correlate
with survival after chemo-immunotherapy [10]. These
considerations prompted us to assess the effects of dual
PI3Kδ and Syk inhibition in CLL using idelalisib and the

novel Syk inhibitor GS-9973.

RESULTS
The Combination of Idelalisib and GS-9973
Synergistically Inhibits Cell Viability at
Nanomolar Concentrations in vitro
Significant synergy was seen in the majority of
samples treated with idelalisib and GS-9973. A heat
map (Figure 1A) of plotted interaction indices depicting
the sensitivity to the combination is shown. For the
majority of samples without synergistic responses,
additive interactions were observed. Specific disease
and/or biologic characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Half of all samples were obtained from patients with
relapsed disease and two of four bone marrow derived
samples were from patients with refractory disease. Three
samples harbored a 17p deletion and seven samples had an
unmutated variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy

chain (IgVh). Disease factors, such as relapsed/refractory
disease, IgVh mutational status, and fluourescent in
situ hybridization results (FISH) did not correlate with
achieving a synergistic response. However, notably, of the
3 samples (PB4, PB14, and BM3) harboring a17p deletion
synergy was seen. Representative cell viability curves for
individual samples are shown (Figure 1B and 1C). Data
for all single agent and combination viability curves are
also included (Supplemental Figure 1). Three of four bone
marrow derived samples showed synergy. Interestingly,
CLL BM1 was resistant (i.e. no significant decrease in cell
viability) to each drug alone but synergistically sensitive
to the combination.

although single agent treatment with idelalisib and GS9973 decreased S6 phosphorylation, the combination was
significantly more potent (Figure 2B). To further evaluate
these agents ability to inhibit BCR mediated signaling
after IgM stiumulation, using immunoblotting, we also
evaluated the inhibitory effects on Ramos cells, a Burkitt’s
cell line with an intact BCR. A significant decrease in AKT
phosphorylation was seen with each drug alone while ERK
phosphorylation was inhibited by GS-9973 +/- GS-1101.
S-6 phosphorylation was also inhibited by the combination
(data not shown).

Effects of Combination of Chemokine/Cytokine
Networks

Idelalisib and GS-9973 Inhibit BCR mediated
signaling pathways

When CLL cells were co-cultured with HS5 stromal
cells (n=6), significantly higher levels of CCL2, CCL3,
CCL4 and CCL22 were seen (Figure 2). Combination
treatment significantly decreased CCL2 (2C), CCL3 (2D),
CCL4 (2E), CCL22 (2F) compared to each individual
drug. To validate the results seen using the HS-5 coculture system, we also tested the effects of idelalisib or
GS-9973 on CLL cells cultured in primary BM stromal
cells (n=3) and saw significant decreases in chemokine
levels (Figure 2G) after idelalisib plus GS-9973 treatment.

To confirm that idelalisib and GS-9973 effectively
inhibit BCR mediated signaling, we evaluated
phosphorylation of Akt and ribosomal S6 in CLL cells
after treatment with idelalisib and GS-9973. Treatment
with each drug alone significantly decreased pAkt at
nanomolar concentrations while combination treatment
did not result in a significant further decline in pAkt
when compared to each inhibitor alone. Conversely,

treatment with the combination significantly decreases S6 phosphorylation as compared to treatment with each drug alone (p = 0.011 for
the combination compared to GS-1101 treatment alone and p= 0.019 compared to GS-9973 alone). Each condition was compared using a
two tailed t-test. (B)The effect of idelalisib (GS-1101) and/or GS-9973 on CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL22 expression after CLL-HS-5

from CLL cells co-cultured with or without (controls) HS-5 cells and various concentrations of idelalisib, GS-9973, or a combination of
idelalisib and/GS-9973 (50 nM plus 50 nM, 50 nM plus 500 nM for each drug, and 500 nM plus 500 nM for each drug) in 6 different
patient samples assessed after 24 hours. Chemokine expression after treatment with individual drug or the combination was compared using
a two tailed t-test. The combination of idelalisib and GS-9973 showed significant effect on decreasing CCL2, CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL22. A
single asterisk denotes significant (p < .05) and a double asterisk (**) represents a significance of p < .01. Differences between single agent
treatment and the combinations are shown. Panels G-J show increased chemokine expression when CLL cells are cultured in the presence
of primary bone marrow derived stromal cells (n=3). Similar to the HS5 co-culture system, co-culture with primary bone marrow leads to
increased chemokine expression (mean +/- SEM supernatant concentrations) which is abrogated by treatment with idelalisib (100 nM) and
GS-9973( 100 nM) for 24 hours. As shown in the last column in each figure, this effect that is significantly enhanced by combining these
two agents (p < .05, two tailed t-test).

DISCUSSION

significant growth inhibition when treated with idelalisib
and GS-9973 in combination. This suggests that this
difficult to eradicate disease compartment may potentially
be successfully targeted with simultaneous PI3Kd and Syk
inhibition. This may not only enhance treatment efficacy
but also suggests a role for treating minimal residual
disease, the presence of which is associated with treatment
failure after initial therapy [16].
As drugs that target the BCR are not classic
cytotoxic agents, their ability to inhibit their downstream
targets and disrupt chemokine/cytokine interactions, which
are essential for CLL cell homing and survival, are critical

Here we show that the combination of idelalisib and
GS-9973 synergistically decreases CLL cell viability in
the majority of CLL samples tested. Significant growth
inhibition was seen in the presence of HS-5 conditioned
media and in patient derived primary bone marrow CLL
cells, which are known to have an activated phenotype
[13] and be more resistant to cytotoxic therapy [14],
[15]. Interestingly one bone marrow derived sample that
was resistant to each drug as a single agent demonstrated

to their mechanism of action. Akt and S6 are known to
be regulated by PI3K and Syk which are effected by BCR
activation [17],[18]. PI3K also receives co-stimulatory
signals from BAFF, CD40, and toll-like receptor
pathways while Fc receptors, chemokines, and integrins
can co-stimulate Syk activation [2]. Phospho-Akt (pAkt)
has previously been shown to decrease after idelalisib
treatment [19] and with Syk inhibition [20]. Here we
confirm that treatment of primary CLL cells with idelalisib
decreases pAkt. GS-9973 also inhibits pAkt at nanomolar
concentrations. Combination treatment did not result in a
significant further decline in pAkt when compared to each
inhibitor alone. The finding that the combination’s ability
to further inhibit S6 phosphorylation is not surprising as
S6 lies downstream of multiple kinase pathways and again
highlights the potential efficacy of inhibiting two tightly
integrated yet distinct signaling pathways.
Chemokine and cytokine levels have been shown
to be elevated in CLL and are known to be an integral
part in maintenance of the CLL cell microenvironment
interaction [21]. Increased expression of CCL3 and
CCL4 has been seen in CLL after BCR activation or coculture with nurse like cells (NLCs) and may contribute
to recruitment of T-cells [22]. Recruitment of T-cells is
further augmented by CCL22 production while CCL2 has
been shown to augment CLL cell survival in vitro [23].
In addition, stromal cell chemokines, such as CXCL12,
aid in CLL chemotaxis into the stromal compartment
and activation of pro-survival signaling. This effect has
been shown to be abrogated by treatment with a number
of agents that target BCR mediated pathways including
Syk [25]. In addition, it is well established that patients
treated with idelalisib have significant reductions in CCL3
and CCL4 and disruption of these networks results in
significant migration of CLL cells out of lymph nodes.
Notably, we found that when CLL cells were cultured
with HS-5 stromal cells or primary bone marrow cells,
increases in CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL22 were
seen. Interestingly, after treatment with each drug alone,
inhibition of chemokine expression was observed an effect
that was significantly enhanced when using idelalisib and
GS-9973 in combination at nM concentrations. These data
suggest that using this combination can further disrupt
chemokine networks known to be essential to CLL homing
and survival. These findings may have implications for
treating resistance to chemo-immunotherapy, single agent
kinase inhibitors, or for targeting minimal residual disease
especially in poor risk patients who have significantly
shorter remissions with monotherapy.
We have shown that the combination of idelalisib
and the novel Syk inhibitor, GS-9973, is effective at
synergistically decreasing CLL cell viability, inhibiting
BCR mediated signaling, and disrupting chemokine
expression in CLL. These data provide rationale for the
clinical combination of agents including PI3Kd and Syk
inhibitors in CLL that target multiple B-cell signaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathways and simultaneously target BCR mediated
pathways. Such Informed combinations, directed at
bypassing feedback loops and interrupting cross talk
between signaling pathways may improve therapeutic
outcomes and continue to significantly inform our
approach to CLL treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell isolation and culture
After informed consent, in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional
review board, lymphocytes were isolated from the
peripheral blood (n=14) or bone marrow (n=4) of
CLL patients and purified using a Ficoll-Paque PLUS
(GE Healthcare) gradient. Disease status and biologic
characteristics for each sample was recorded. Cells were
used fresh or collected for viable frozen samples in fetal
bovine serum with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid
nitrogen. Culture media was made with RPMI-1640
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4mM
L-Glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. Conditioned
media was prepared by culturing the RPMI over confluent
HS-5 human stromal cell line for 3 hours.

Inhibitor combinations and synergy
Ficoll purified CLL cells (2x105) isolated from bone
marrow or peripheral blood were treated with each drug
alone and with six equimolar concentrations of idelalisib
and GS-9973-obtained from Gilead Sciences, Inc. ranging
from .977 nM to 10μM on 96-well plates in triplicate. GS9973 is highly selective for Syk. Its chemical structure and
kinase selectivity using the DiscoveRx kinome panel (San
Diego, CA) for Kd determinations as compared to R406
are shown in Table 2. Plated cells were then cultured in
HS-5 conditioned media at 37°C with 5% CO2. After 72
hours of culture, viability was determined using an MTS
assay (Cell Titer 96, Promega). Viability data were used
to generate cell viability curves for each drug alone and
in combination for each sample. The potential synergy
of the combination of idelalisib and GS-9973 at a given
equimolar concentration was determined using the median
effect model [11]. The statistical modeling was run in R
using a script that utilizes the median effect model [12]. A
value of 1, less than 1, and greater than 1 using R defines
an additive interaction, synergistic and antagonistic,
respectively. The Lee et al. method calculates a 95%
confidence interval for each data point. For each viability
curve, to be considered synergistic, a data point must have
an interaction index below 1 and the upper confidence
interval must also be below 1. In order to summarize and
demonstrate collective synergy results, a heat map was

Inhibition of BCR mediated signaling pathways
For flow cytometry experiments, ficoll purified
CLL cells obtained from 14 patients were co-cultured
with HS5 stromal cells and then treated with each
drug alone (100 nM) or in combination (100 nM each)
for 24 hours. CLL cells were stained with anti-CD5fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Clone BL1a, Beckman
Coulter, Indianapolis IN) and anti-CD19- Phycoerythrin
(PE) (Clone 1D3, BD Biosciences, San Jose CA) to
identify CLL cells, and either anti- phopho-AktS473,
anti-phospho-S6 (Alexa Fluor 488, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) or an isotype-matched control antibody
(mouse IgG1-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA). FITC-CD5/CD19+ cells were gated
(using anti-CD5-FITC and Anti-CD19-PE) and analyzed
by 3-color flow cytometry to quantify intracellular
phospho‑AktS473 levels (Cytomics FC 500MPL cell sorter
and MXP Version 2.2 software, Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA).
To further validate these agents’ ability to inhibit
BCR mediated signaling we evaluated Ramos cells, a
Burkitt’s cell line with intact BCR. 5x106 cells were plated
and treated with 1 μM of idelalisib, GS-9973 alone or in
combination and were cultured for 24 hours in standard
culture media. 20μg Goat F(ab’)2 anti-human IgM
(Invitrogen) was added to stimulate the BCR for 30min.
Protein isolates were subjected to immune-blotting with
Phospho-Akt (S473), phospho-Erk (T202/Y204) (Cell
Signaling), and phospho-S6 (Cell signaling).
