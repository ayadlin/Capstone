BACKGROUND: The current study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus pemetrexed as secondline therapy for patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, phase 2 study, patients with EGFR wild-type
and EGFR FISH-positive adenocarcinoma who had developed disease progression after 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapy were
randomly assigned (1:1) to receive erlotinib or pemetrexed until the time of disease progression or death, unacceptable toxicity, or a
request for discontinuation by the patient. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 123 patients
were enrolled (61 in the erlotinib arm and 62 in the pemetrexed arm). The median PFS was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.6 months-6.6 months) in the erlotinib group versus 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.7 months-5.1 months) in the pemetrexed group. The
difference in PFS between the 2 treatment groups was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62-1.37 [P 5.683]). The objective
response rate appeared to be higher among patients receiving erlotinib compared with those receiving pemetrexed (19.7% vs 8.1%;
P 5.062). The 3 most commonly recorded adverse events were rash (54.1%), fatigue (19.7%), and diarrhea (16.4%) in the erlotinib
group and fatigue (25.8%), nausea (24.2%), and anorexia (14.5%) in the pemetrexed group. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant
differences noted with regard to efficacy between erlotinib and pemetrexed in the second-line setting for patients with advanced
EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Both regimens appear to be effective treatment options for these

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and > 7 in 10 patients are presented with advanced-stage disease at
the time of diagnosis.1 Standard first-line treatment for these patients usually consists of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy,2,3 but disease progression ultimately occurs for most patients. Second-line treatment options available to patients
who experience failure of first-line treatment include additional chemotherapy (docetaxel and pemetrexed) or targeted
therapy.4-7 Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) have been investigated in several
studies in the second-line setting. The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study BR.21 trial
reported prolonged survival with erlotinib compared with placebo (median survival, 7.9 months vs 3.7 months) in
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after the failure of previous chemotherapy,7 whereas in the
INTEREST (IRESSA Non-small-cell lung cancer Trial Evaluating REsponse and Survival against Taxotere) study and
the V-15-32 study, gefitinib was found to have noninferior survival compared with docetaxel.8,9
Several studies have demonstrated that a high EGFR gene copy number was associated with great sensitivity and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) among patients with NSCLC after treatment with EGFR TKIs.7,10-14 However,

subsequent studies indicated that a high EGFR copy
number was not associated with greater PFS when comparing EGFR TKIs versus chemotherapy.15,16 Accordingly, biomarker analyses of the IPASS (IRESSA Pan-Asia
Study) trial suggested that the apparent PFS benefit of
gefitinib in patients with a high EGFR copy number was
driven by overlapping with a coexisting EGFR mutation.17 The value of the EGFR copy number as a predictive marker among patients with NSCLC who are treated
with TKIs remains controversial.
Pemetrexed was approved for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC after the findings of a phase 3
trial by Hanna et al demonstrated equivalent outcomes to
docetaxel. Pemetrexed was associated with fewer adverse
events compared with docetaxel and comparable efficacy
(median survival of 8.3 months vs 7.9 months).6 However, to the best of our knowledge, no trial has been
designed to date comparing EGFR TKIs with chemotherapy in patients with EGFR wild-type and EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive (high
polysomy or gene amplification) lung adenocarcinoma in
the second-line setting. Although the evaluations of
EGFR mutation and EGFR copy number were believed
to be time-consuming and not feasible for all the patients,
they are needed when there are predictive biomarkers for
the efficacy of EGFR TKIs.
This phase 2 study was designed to assess the efficacy
and safety of erlotinib compared with pemetrexed as
second-line treatment of patients with EGFR wild-type
and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Procedure and Treatment Plan

This prospective, randomized, open-label, phase 2 study
in which erlotinib was compared with pemetrexed as
second-line therapy in patients with advanced EGFR
wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma
was conducted in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.
This trial was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee
and Clinical Trial Review Committee of the study institution and followed the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice guidelines. All enrolled patients provided
signed written informed consent before the study-related
procedures; separate signed written consents were
obtained for analyses of biomarkers. Tumor tissue was
used from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, archival
diagnostic tumor tissue. All EGFR mutations were
assessed by the amplification-refractory mutation system
(ARMS) method.18 Patients were classified as EGFR
1380

mutation-negative if they did not have an EGFR mutation. FISH positivity was defined as high polysomy or gene
amplification.10 Tumors were classified according to the
1997 International System for Staging Lung Cancer.19 The
primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR),
overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
receive either erlotinib or pemetrexed. Randomization
was stratified by sex (female vs male), Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 to 1 vs
2), and smoking history (never vs ever) with a minimization algorithm. Erlotinib was administered orally at a dose
of 150 mg per day; pemetrexed was administered on day 1
of every 3-week cycle as a 10-minute intravenous infusion
of 500 mg/m2. Patients in the pemetrexed treatment arm
were also given vitamin B12 and dexamethasone to reduce
toxicities. Treatment continued until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or a request for discontinuation by
the patient. Poststudy treatment was based on the decision
of the physicians and patients.
Patients

Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years to 75 years,
had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2, had pathologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB to IV lung adenocarcinoma (including locally advanced and metastatic
lung adenocarcinoma) or postoperative recurrent lung adenocarcinoma not curable by surgery or radiotherapy, had
EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive disease, had
received 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapy (including
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy), and had a life expectancy of  3 months. Patients with postoperative disease recurrence have to have developed recurrence within 6
months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.
Other inclusion criteria were adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count of > 1.0 3 109=L, platelet
count > 100 3 109=L, and hemoglobin > 90 g=L),
adequate liver function (bilirubin < 1.5 times upper limit
of normal and serum transaminase < 2 times upper limit
of normal) and renal function (creatinine < 2 mg=dL), and
the presence of 2-dimensional measurable disease.
Patients were excluded if they had received prior
EGFR TKIs or pemetrexed, or had concurrent uncontrolled illness. Other exclusion criteria were prior malignant
disease (except for basal cell carcinomas), symptomatic
brain metastases, and pregnancy.
Assessments

The baseline assessment before study entry involved a history
and physical examination, hematologic and biochemical

testing, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and radiographic
imaging of all involved sites of disease (thoracic and upper
abdomen computed tomography scan, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and other examination when necessary).
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of tumor progression or death
from any cause; data were censored at the time of the last
tumor assessment if disease progression or death did not
occur. Tumor responses were evaluated every 6 weeks
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST). OS was defined as the time from the
date of randomization to the date of death from any cause;
data were censored at the last time patients were known to
be alive. Safety and tolerability were assessed every 3 weeks
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Statistical Analysis

Efficacy and safety analyses were performed for all the
randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of the
trial medication and had at least 1 safety follow-up. This
trial was designed to detect a 40% decrease in the hazard
of progression with erlotinib versus pemetrexed (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.6). In consideration of the possibility of a
deviation from assessment, a total of 120 patients (60
patients per treatment arm) were required to provide 80%
power with a 1-sided significance level of 5%.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
PFS and OS. The HR of erlotinib to pemetrexed was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and P
values. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and
OS between the 2 treatment groups. Preplanned subgroup analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model,
including sex, smoking history, ECOG performance status, and best response to the prior chemotherapy, was
used to estimate the HR for PFS and OS. The chi-square
test or Fisher exact test was used to compare the ORRs
and adverse events (AEs) between the 2 groups. All P values were 2-sided and P values < 0.05 were considered to
be statistically significant.
This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01565538).
RESULTS
From December 2008 to May 2012, a total of 123
patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive
either erlotinib or pemetrexed (Fig. 1). The treatment
groups were well matched for baseline characteristics
including sex, ECOG performance status, stage of disease,
and smoking history (Table 1). Greater than one-half of

the patients were current smokers and most patients had
an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. On the date of
data cutoff (May 10, 2012), the median follow-up was
14.7 months (range, 0.5 months-41.9 months). After the
study, 49% of the patients in the erlotinib treatment
group received no other therapy except for further erlotinib, and 23% received subsequent pemetrexed; of the
patients in the pemetrexed group, 61% received subsequent erlotinib and 18% received no other therapy apart
from pemetrexed (Table 2).
By the time of analysis, 100 instances of disease progression (51 in the erlotinib group and 49 in the pemetrexed group) and 89 deaths had occurred (42 in the
erlotinib group and 47 in the pemetrexed group), and disease progression or death was the main reason for withdrawing from the study. The median PFS was 4.1 months
(95% CI, 1.6 months-6.6 months) in the erlotinib group
versus 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.7 months-5.1 months) in
the pemetrexed group. The 6-month PFS rates were
45.1% and 38.8%, respectively, among the patients
treated with erlotinib and those receiving pemetrexed.
The difference in the primary endpoint between the erlotinib and pemetrexed groups was not statistically significant (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62-1.37 [P 5 .683])

(Fig. 2A). PFS results were consistent across all the preplanned subgroups (Table 3).
According to the investigatorâ€™s assessment, 12 of 61
patients in the erlotinib arm (19.7%) and 5 of 62 patients
in the pemetrexed arm (8.1%) experienced an objective
response. All the objective responses were partial responses
and there was no complete response reported (Table 4).
In general, the ORR appeared to be higher among
patients in the erlotinib arm compared with the pemetrexed arm, although the difference was not statistically
significant (P 5 .062). The median OS was 11.7 months
(95% CI, 7.5 months-15.9 months) in the patients
treated with erlotinib and 13.4 months (95% CI, 9.2
months-17.7 months) among those in the pemetrexed
1382

group; and no statistically significant difference in OS was
observed (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54 [P 5 .970]) (Fig.
2B). The OS results were consistent across all the preplanned subgroups (Table 3).
The common AEs are listed in Table 5. The overall
treatment-related AE rates were similar between the erlotinib group and the pemetrexed group (73.8% vs 69.4%).
The 3 most commonly recorded AEs were rash (54.1%),
fatigue (19.7%), and diarrhea (16.4%) in the erlotinib
group, whereas fatigue (25.8%), nausea (24.2%), and anorexia (14.5%) were the 3 most common AEs reported in
the pemetrexed arm. Patients in the erlotinib group experienced significantly higher rates of rash and diarrhea
compared with those in the pemetrexed group, whereas
patients receiving pemetrexed experienced significantly
higher rates of nausea compared with those receiving erlotinib. The recorded AEs were generally mild (grade 1 or
2), with the exception of 4 patients in the erlotinib group
(6.6%) and 3 patients in the pemetrexed group (4.8%)
who developed a grade 3 or higher AE. Only 1 patient in

cases of dose modification or death were reported as a
result of study treatment in both groups.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first randomized study that targeted EGFR wild-type and EGFR
FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma. This study failed to
demonstrate the superiority of erlotinib over pemetrexed,
and the differences with regard to PFS, OS, and the ORR
were not statistically significant between erlotinib and
pemetrexed when used as the second-line treatment of
patients with EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive
adenocarcinoma. Results from subgroup analyses for PFS
and OS were consistent with overall results.
Although several phase 3 studies comparing EGFR
TKIs with chemotherapy in the second-line setting have
Cancer

May 1, 2014

demonstrated that similar efficacy exists between EGFR
TKIs and chemotherapy, to the best of our knowledge
these studies were not designed to investigate the potential
effect of EGFR mutational status on efficacy.8,9,16,20-22
The TAILOR (TArceva Italian Lung Optimization tRial)
trial compared erlotinib with docetaxel as the second-line
treatment of advanced NSCLC in patients with wild-type
EGFR disease. Results of the trial demonstrated that compared with docetaxel, erlotinib was effective in patients
with wild-type EGFR. The median PFS was 2.9 months
and 2.4 months, respectively, in the docetaxel and the
erlotinib arms (P 5 .02).23 In a recent phase 3 trial, a
comparison of docetaxel with erlotinib as second-line or
third-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC
who had wild-type EGFR indicated that PFS was significantly improved with docetaxel (HR, 0.69; 95% CI,
0.52-0.93 [P 5 .013]).24 In another recent phase 2 study
in patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC who
had
wild-type
EGFR,
second-line
treatment
with pemetrexed was found to confer a significantly longer PFS than gefitinib (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.73
[P < .001]).25 These findings suggest that for patients presented with EGFR wild-type NSCLC, chemotherapy is
superior to an EGFR TKI. However, to the best of our
knowledge, none of these studies were designed to address
the role of EGFR gene copy number as a predictive
marker among patients with wild-type EGFR.
The IPASS trial established the role of EGFR TKIs
as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR mutant
NSCLC, whereas for patients with EGFR wild-type
tumors, the PFS was significantly shorter among patients

receiving gefitinib compared with those undergoing chemotherapy (HR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05-3.98 [P < .001]).26
However, a combined analysis of the second-line=thirdline National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials
Group Study BR.21 trial and the maintenance setting
SATURN trial (Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable
NSCLC) demonstrated that for patients with wild-type
NSCLC, erlotinib provided a significant improvement in
PFS (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.87 [P < .01]) and OS
(HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87 [P 5 .04]).27 In the IPASS
trial, although high EGFR copy number is associated with
longer PFS, a high EGFR copy number without an accompanying mutation was associated with a shorter PFS with
gefitinib therapy.17 Although evidence from a metaanalysis demonstrated that a high EGFR copy number is
associated with improved survival outcomes with EGFR
TKIs, to the best of our knowledge the role of EGFR copy
number as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of EGFR
TKIs remains controversial.14 The results of the current
study demonstrated that erlotinib had efficacy similar to that
of chemotherapy. In view of the evidence of the superiority
of chemotherapy for patients with EGFR wild-type
NSCLC,23-25 the current study results indicate that EGFR
TKIs should still be considered as an effective option for
patients with EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive
lung adenocarcinoma.
The PFS noted among patients in the erlotinib arm
(median PFS, 4.1 months) in the current study was notably longer than those in previous, unselected, populationbased studies or studies targeting wild-type EGFR, which
1384

reported PFS of 1.5 months to 3.6 months for patients on
the TKI arm.7-9,11,16,22-25 Reasons for the longer PFS
may largely relate to the 100% second-line setting and the
100% EGFR FISH-positive adenocarcinoma study
design. Most previous studies were designed for previously treated patients with NSCLC who had failed of 1 or
2 prior chemotherapy regimens.7-9,11,22,24 In the 100%
second-line setting TITAN (Tarceva In Treatment of
Advanced NSCLC) trial, all the enrolled patients were
those with poor prognosis (developed disease progression
during 4 cycles of first-line chemotherapy).16 Another reason might be the selection of erlotinib instead of gefitinib
as second-line treatment. In the BR.21 trial, erlotinib prolonged survival for pretreated patients with EGFR wildtype NSCLC.27 Erlotinib was approved for the second-line
treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC,7 whereas
gefitinib was not. Furthermore, the longer PFS might be
related to the high percentage of patients with postoperative
disease recurrence. Because postoperative patients have a
smaller tumor burden, their survival might be better.
The OS reported among patients in the erlotinib
arm (median OS, 11.7 months) in the current study was
in keeping with that demonstrated in previous studies,
which reported an OS of 5.3 months to 14.8 months for
patients treated with TKIs.7-9,11,16,22-25 However, the
interpretation of the OS results of the current study might
be confounded by the imbalance of crossover. In the current study, 61% of the patients in whom second-line
pemetrexed failed crossed over to erlotinib therapy, but
only 23% of the patients in whom second-line erlotinib
Cancer

Erlotinib vs Pemetrexed in NSCLC/Li et al

failed crossed over to pemetrexed therapy. It is interesting
to note that there was a trend toward improvement in the
ORR among patients in the erlotinib arm, which is consistent with the results of previous studies.10,12,13,15 However, it is still unclear why the improved ORR did not
translate into prolonged PFS or OS in the current study.
As expected, rash and diarrhea occurred more frequently with erlotinib treatment, whereas nausea and leukopenia occurred more often among the patients treated
with pemetrexed. Overall, the occurrence and severity of
AEs in the current study were much the same as those in
previous studies and there were no unexpected toxicities
in either group. In terms of convenience, compared with
chemotherapy administered in the hospital setting, erlotinib can be taken orally at home. Together with its efficacy
results, we believe that erlotinib should still be considered
as a valid option for patients with advanced EGFR wildtype and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma.
Although the numbers of patients were relatively
small, the results of the current study, which targeted the
treatment of patients with EGFR wild-type and EGFR
FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma in the second-line
setting, enrich the clinical evidence for the efficacy and
safety of second-line therapy with EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy among patients with advanced NSCLC.
In conclusion, the differences in efficacy between
erlotinib and pemetrexed were not found to be significant
for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced
EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Both erlotinib and pemetrexed appear to be
effective treatment options in the second-line setting for
patients with advanced EGFR wild-type and EGFR
FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma.
