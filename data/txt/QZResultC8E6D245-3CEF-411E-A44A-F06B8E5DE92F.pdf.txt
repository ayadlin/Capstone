ABSTRACT
Identification of novel anticancer drugs presenting more than one molecular
target and efficacy against cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) subpopulations represents
a therapeutic need to combat the resistance and the high risk of relapse in
patients. In the present work we show how Bozepinib [(RS)-2,6-dichloro-9-[1-(pnitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4,1-benzoxazepin-3-yl]-9H-purine], a
small anti-tumor compound, demonstrated selectivity on cancer cells and showed
an inhibitory effect over kinases involved in carcinogenesis, proliferation and
angiogenesis. The cytotoxic effects of Bozepinib were observed in both breast and
colon cancer cells expressing different receptor patterns. Bozepinib inhibited HER-2
signaling pathway and JNK and ERKs kinases. In addition, Bozepinib has an inhibitory
effect on AKT and VEGF together with anti-angiogenic and anti-migratory activities.
Moreover, the modulation of pathways involved in tumorigenesis by Bozepinib was
also evident in microarrays analysis. Interestingly, Bozepinib inhibited both mamoand colono-spheres formation and eliminated ALDH+ CSCs subpopulations at a low
micromolar range similar to Salinomycin. Bozepinib induced the down-regulation of
c-MYC, β-CATENIN and SOX2 proteins and the up-regulation of the GLI-3 hedgehogsignaling repressor. Finally, Bozepinib shows in vivo anti-tumor and anti-metastatic
efficacy in xenotransplanted nude mice without presenting sub-acute toxicity. These
findings support further studies on the therapeutic potential of Bozepinib in cancer
patients.

targets for developing new anti-tumor drugs. In this
way, the epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR and
HER2 are frequently over-expressed in several human
cancers of epithelial origin and play essential roles in the
development and progression of cancer [2, 3]. HER2 is
over-expressed in several tumors, including breast and
colorectal cancers [4]. In normal cells, the HER proteins
regulate cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration and
differentiation through a network of signaling pathways.
The over-expression of this receptor in breast cancer is
often associated with increased disease recurrence and a
worse prognosis. Moreover, in patients where hormonal
therapy is not effective, HER2 becomes a critical target
for treatment [5]. Since signal transduction networks
integrate multiple upstream inputs, targeting pathways
downstream of the receptors could conceivably result
in greater therapeutic efficacy and broader applicability.
Moreover, kinase inhibitors that reduce the excessive
proliferation signaling are revealed as one of the most
important emergent therapies against cancer [6]. For this
reason, kinome profiling has arisen as an important tool to
develop targeted therapies against kinases with aberrant
expression directly involved in cancer pathology [7].
The mortality rate of breast and colorectal cancer
is high because of disease recurrence, which remains the
major therapeutic barrier in these types of cancer. Although
chemotherapy or radiotherapy can kill most bulky tumor
cells and provide temporary remission, relapse occurs in
most cases, as explained in the recently proposed cancer
stem cell hypothesis [8, 9]. This hypothesis implies that a
subset of tumor cells has the ability to self-renew and is
the source of tumor initiation, progression and recurrence.
These cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) may also contribute
to tumor formation, metastasis, and treatment resistance.
It has been found that multiple stem cell-related molecules
and enzymatic activities are highly expressed in breast
and colon CSCs, including c-MYC [10, 11], β-CATENIN
[12, 13], SOX-2 [14, 15], ALDH1 activity [16], among
others. Targeting pathways or molecules up-regulated in
differentiated cancer cells and/or in CSCs populations but
not in normal cells can provide new strategies for selective
therapy.
Recently, our group has reported the synthesis
and anticancer activities of new (RS)-4,1-benzoxazepinpurines against human breast and colon cancer cell lines
[17]. The most active compound (RS)-2,6-dichloro9-[1-(p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4,1benzoxazepin-3-yl]-9H-purine, named as Bozepinib,
presents very low inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values
in both breast and colon cancer cells, being the most
potent structure that we have reported [17, 18]. Bozepinib
induces the cell death of cancer cells by apoptosis also
triggering other interesting anti-tumor activities such
as autophagy and senescence processes in cancer cells
without inducing acute toxicity in mice [17, 18]. These
effects make Bozepinib a very attractive anti-tumor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

agent, opening a new strategy in cancer chemotherapy
with future clinical application in cancer. The aim of this
work was to characterize the mechanism of action of
this drug analyzing its effect over kinases, receptors and
signaling pathways that are targets for new promising
therapies. In addition, we evaluated its effect on enriched
subpopulations of CSCs and in related proteins of CSCs
pathways. Finally, we studied the in vivo anti-tumor
activity of Bozepinib using xenograft transplants of breast
and colon cancer.

RESULTS
Bozepinib has an antiproliferative and selective
effect on breast and colon cancer cell lines
We have previously described the anti-tumor
effect of Bozepinib in some breast and colon cancer cell
lines [17, 18]. To test the selective action of Bozepinib
against breast and colon cancer cells we determined the
therapeutic index (TI). As shown in Table 1, the IC50 value
of CCD-18Co, a non-tumor colon cell line, was almost
double that in T84 and HT29 colon tumor cells and more
than triple for Caco-2 and SW-480 colon cancer cell lines,
showing a TI close to 9 for the SW-480 cell line. Better
results were obtained in breast cancer cell lines where
the IC50 values determined for the MCF-10A non-tumor
cell line were more than five times higher that the IC50
determined for MCF-7 and SKBR-3 breast cancer cell
lines and almost double that of the value determined for
MDA-MB 468 cancer cells, presenting the MDA-MB 231
a TI equal to 11 (Table 1). These values confirm the potent
anti-tumor effects of the drug and its selective cancer
activity.

HER2 signaling pathway and several proliferative
kinases are inhibited by Bozepinib
To study the effect of Bozepinib on cancer
proliferation pathways, we carried out an ex vivo
multikinase screening assay (n=36) using 5µM and 50µM
(Supplementary Table S3). Bozepinib treatment at 50µM
showed a significant inhibitory effect over numerous
kinases such as JNK and ERKs, inhibiting also the EGFR
and HER2 cellular signaling pathways. In fact, HER2,
AKT2 and VEGF receptors were considerably inhibited
in the screening (Supplementary Table S3). In order to
analyze whether Bozepinib inhibits the HER2 signaling
pathways in breast cancer cells, we treated the HER2
positive SKBR-3 cell line with 5 µM of Bozepinib and we
analyzed the expression and activation of proteins involved
in HER2 signaling at different times post-treatment by
western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Whereas the total level
of HER2 receptor remained stable during treatment, the

post-treatment. Consequently, p-AKT was also inhibited
and accompanied with a significant decrease in the total
level of VEGF (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we also detected
both the inhibition of ERKs and JNK phosphorylation in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cell lines, that
was more notable in MCF-7 cells at 4 hours post-treatment
and in MDA-MB 468 cell line after 8 hours post-treatment
(Fig. 1B and 1C). Whereas phosphorylation of JNK was
not detectable in normal MCF-10A mammary epithelial
cells as previously described [19], the phosporylation of
ERKs was weakly up-regulated at 8 hours post-treatment
and was similar to the control non-treated cells at 16 hours

of apoptosis was detected only at 8 hours post-treatment
showing an increase of just 15% compared to control
cells. However, the vessel-like structures formation was
inhibited after Bozepinib treatment at these doses (Fig.
2A).
In order to evaluate the effects of Bozepinib on
cell migration, we performed a wound healing assay on
SKBR-3 breast and HCT-116 colon cancer cell lines.
Data showed a significant dose-dependent cell migration
inhibition after 48h of treatment with 0.2, 2 and 5 µM of
Bozepinib compared to mock-treated cells (Fig. 2C and
2D). The known Interferon alpha (IFN) anti-proliferative
agent has been included as a control [20].

The ability of Bozepinib to suppress capillarylike structures was assessed by culturing HUVEC
endothelial cells on MATRIGELTM-coated wells. As
shown in Fig. 2A, HUVEC were able to form capillarylike structures. However, Bozepinib was enough to inhibit
the development of these capillary-like structures in a
dose-dependent manner after 4 and 8h of treatment (Fig.
2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the HUVECs viability was
maintained throughout 4 and 8 hours of treatment with
low doses of Bozepinib (0,01 µM and 0,1 µM). At 4 and

Bozepinib exposure we performed a microarray assay
comparing the effect of 5 µM in MDA-MB 468 cells at
4 and 16h post-treatment. After 4h of treatment, from 178
genes differentially expressed (cut-off values >1.5 fold
change and p<0.05), 115 genes were up-regulated whereas
64 genes were down-regulated. At 16h, about 471 genes
were differentially expressed, with 143 up-regulated and
328 down-regulated (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables S47). We observed the down-regulation of genes involved in
breast cancer tumorigenesis (BRCA1, DKK1, CLAUDIN1),

detected in both SKBR-3 and HCT-116 cell lines with
a high level of expression in ALDH+ subpopulations in
comparison with the ALDH- subpopulations. Bozepinib
induced a significant reduction of c-MYC level in ALDH+
HCT-116 cells and, interestingly, was able to inhibit its
expression in ALDH+ SKBR-3-treated cells and in
ALDH- subpopulations of both HCT-116 and SKBR-3
cells (Fig. 5E and 5F). The same trend was obtained for
β-CATENIN expression where Bozepinib reduced its level
in ALDH+ SKBR3 subpopulation. However, β-CATENIN
was not expressed in ALDH- SKBR-3 cells. In addition,
our compound was able to reduce β-CATENIN expression
in ALDH+ HCT-116 subpopulation and to inhibit them in
ALDH- HCT-116 cells (Fig. 5E and 5F).
GLI-3, a described inhibitor of stem cell properties
[22] was detected in ALDH- HCT-116 cells and was
absent in the ALDH+ HCT-116 subpopulations. After
the Bozepinib treatment GLI-3 was strongly induced in
both subpopulations. However, no changes at protein
level were detected in ALDH+/- subpopulations isolated
from the SKBR-3 cell line (data not shown). The stem
cell transcription factor SOX2 was detected in HCT-116
ALDH+ subpopulation but was reduced after treatment
with IC50 and practically disappeared after treatment with
2×IC50 of Bozepinib. In HCT-116 ALDH- subpopulation
the expression of SOX2 protein was very weak (Fig. 5E
and 5F).

among others (Fig. 3A).
The gene list was then subdivided into functional
categories by term enrichment score with DAVID
bioinformatic analysis. A summary of functional gene
clusters is shown in Fig. 3B. In addition the IPA system
was used to generate networks of molecular relationships
between different genes (the cut-off log ratio was set at
1.5) (Fig. 4A). We subsequently validated the microarray
results in MDA-MB 468 cells using qRT-PCR. As shown
in Fig. 4B, CSE and CXCL10 were up-regulated while
MAML2, E2F8A, NOTCH3 and CLAUDIN1 were downregulated in MDA-MB 468 cells.

Bozepinib has cytotoxicity against CSCs
subpopulations and inhibits the expression of
CSCs-related proteins
We determined the cytotoxic effect of Bozepinib
on SKBR-3 and MDA-MB 468 breast and HCT-116
colon CSCs enriched subpopulations by growing them
into low attachment plates with sphere forming medium
for 72h. After that, CSCs were separated using ALDH
activity by FACS (Supplementary Fig. S1). IC50 values
were determined in both ALDH positive cells (called
ALDH+), ALDH negative cells (called ALDH-) and in
cells growing in sphere forming medium without sorter
enrichment process (called No Sorter). Moreover, we used
Salinomycin as reference of a potent anti-CSCs drug [21].
As shown in Fig. 5A, Bozepinib showed an IC50 range in
SKBR-3 and MDA-MB 468 cells around that displayed
by Salinomycin. Moreover, our compound was able to
considerably reduce the number and size of spheres at
5 µM and to abolish the sphere-formation ability after
treatment with 20 µM (Fig. 5B and 5C).
Next, we analyzed the apoptosis levels induced
by Bozepinib in ALDH+/- subpopulations, showing that
Bozepinib was able to induce a significant level of cell
death by apoptosis in the resistant ALDH + subpopulations
from both SKBR-3 and HCT-116 cell lines. Higher levels
of apoptosis were detected in the ALDH- subpopulations
(Fig. 5D).
Finally, we determined the modification of several
described proteins involved in the stem cell phenotype
of these subpopulations such as GLI-3, SOX-2, c-MYC
and β-CATENIN. For this aim, both ALDH+ and ALDHSKBR-3 breast and HCT-116 colon cancer subpopulations
were treated with the IC50 and twice the IC50 of Bozepinib
values for 24 hours. The c-MYC oncoprotein was

Bozepinib inhibits growth and metastasis of
tumor xenografts in nude mice without induction
of sub-acute toxicity
We have previously reported that Bozepinib has
no acute toxicity in BALB/c mice even at the highest
i.p. bolus dose of 200 mg/kg and p.o. bolus dose of
50 mg/kg after 2 weeks [17]. In the present work we
decided to evaluate the sub-acute toxicity after 29 days
of i.p. treatment with 100 mg/kg twice a week, showing
that Bozepinib-treated mice presented no weight loss
or unusual behavior (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and the
histopathologic examination did not find any detectable
toxicity in the liver or kidneys (data not shown). These
data indicate that, at the concentration used, Bozepinib did
not cause any systemic damage.
To evaluate the effect of Bozepinib on tumour
growth, heterotopic tumour xenografts were established
using the MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cell line and the HT29 colon cancer cell line. Nine days later, tumors reached
a size superior to 100 mm3, and the mice received an i.p.
injection of 25 mg/kg of Bozepinib or methylcellulose 1%,
respectively. Bozepinib treatment significantly inhibited
colon and breast cancer tumor growth when compared
with control group (P < 0.01, n = 12). From day 3 for HT29 cell line and day 18 for MDA-MB 468 after Bozepinib
injection, the average of tumor volume was significantly

lower in comparison with control group (Fig. 6A-B and
Supplementary Figure S2B). Inmunohistochemistry
analysis showed that primary breast cancer tumours had a
different morphological appearance between mice mocktreated and treated with Bozepinib. Control group had a
significant cell number indicative of a highly proliferative
tissue; however, mice treated with Bozepinib displayed
small size of tumors and with necrotic and non-viable
tumor areas (Fig. 6B). The moderate ability of MDAMB 468 cells to form metastasis in nude mice has been
described [23]. We were able to detect lung metastasis in
5 of 6 (83.3%) mice in the control group (Fig. 6B) and,
surprisingly, only 1 out of 6 mice (16.6%) treated with
Bozepinib presented a lung metastasis. The antimigratory
effect of Bozepinib together these in vivo results suggest
the potential of Bozepinib also as an anti-metastatic
compound.

[27]. Bozepinib also presented an inhibitory effect over
AKT, JNK, ERKs and VEGF signaling pathways. AKT
is an important part of PI3K signaling and its activation
is involved in tumor progression through increased cell
proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis [28]. More
investigation is necessary in order to determine if the
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation induced by Bozepinib
would be involved in the down-regulation of constitutively
active PI3K/Akt/mTOR. Whereas an inhibition on EGFR
activity was detected by the kinome assay, we were not
able to detect changes in the phosphorylation of the
receptor in EGFR positive MDA-MB 468 cells treated
with EGF and Bozepinib (data not shown). However, we
detected inhibition in the JNK and ERKs phosphorylation
in both MCF-7 cells described as negative for EGFR
expression and in MDA-MB 468 cells expressing high
EGFR levels [29]. ERK inhibitors are currently considered
as a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients who
relapse on BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy [30]. The
selective effect of Bozepinib over tumors expressing
these mutations opens a new via to be investigated with
this novel drug. The therapeutic effect of JNK inhibitors
has been described as proliferation suppressors with antitumor consequences and, in fact, several JNK inhibitors
are currently in preclinical stages [31, 32]. Our data
suggest that Bozepinib is a selective inhibitor of HER2
signaling, but its anti-tumor activity on breast and colon
cancer cells lines expressing different receptors patterns
suggests several mechanisms of action for this compound.
The inhibition of proliferative signaling usually
converges in the inhibition of angiogenesis and cell
migration [31]. In fact, Bozepinib was able to reduce the
VEGF basal level detected in the SKBR-3 cancer cells and
showed inhibitory effects against VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2
and VEGFR-3 in the kinome assay. In accordance with the
anti-angiogenic properties and the inhibition of migration
presented by Bozepinib in cancer cell lines, the metastatic
capacity of MDA-MB 468 cells xenotransplanted in nude
mice was also inhibited after i.p. treatment, suggesting the
clinical potential of this promising anti-tumor drug.
The modulation of pathways involved in
tumorigenesis by Bozepinib was also evident in the geneprofiling assays carried out by microarrays analysis in
breast cancer-treated cells at different times. The data
obtained suggest numerous mechanisms that could be
involved in the anti-tumor activity of this compound.
Bozepinib treatment up-regulated several genes involved
in metabolic routes, such as cytochrome p450 family
genes and glutathione metabolism related genes. Both
routes are not only involved in the metabolism of drugs
but also in anti-tumor processes such as detoxification,
stress response, apoptosis and proliferation [33, 34].
Moreover, the gene expression of Cysthiathionine-Lyase
CSE, an enzyme with anti-proliferative properties that
engages ERKs and JNK signaling [35], was up-regulated
after Bozepinib treatment. In addition, we found the up-

DISCUSSION
Identification and characterization of new
pharmacological activities from novel drugs represent an
effective way of accelerating the translation of discoveries
from bench to clinical applications. Previously, we have
identified Bozepinib as a potent anti-tumor compound
against breast and colon cancer cells [17, 18, 24] .
Although we described the role of protein kinase PKR
as a target of Bozepinib involved in the apoptosis of
breast and colon cancer cells [18], here we have made a
profound study of the mechanism of action of this drug.
We demonstrated the selective effect of Bozepinib that
exhibited high TI in both breast and colon cancer cells,
and we identified interesting signaling pathways involved
in its efficacy.
Bozepinib was a selective inhibitor of HER2
positive breast cancer cells as we demonstrated by the
kinase assay, also verified with immunoblot analysis in the
HER2 positive SKBR-3 breast cancer cell line, and in the
xenotrasplant of HER 2 positive HT-29 colon cancer cells
[25] in nude mice. Approximately, 25-30% of all primary
breast tumors over-express the HER2 receptor, which is
associated with a poor prognosis and an overall survival
decrease in patients [5]. Trastuzumab, is actually used in
first line clinical treatment for metastatic HER2 positive
breast tumors, showing an overall survival improvement
in patients. However, a considerable percentage of
patients with metastatic disease ultimately develop
resistance to trastuzumab [26], which increases the need
of developing novel targeted therapies that overcome
treatment resistance. In this way it is important to target
not only the proliferating related receptors but also
downstream signaling proteins involved in this process.
In fact, current therapies are based on the combinations of
different drugs with the aim to target both HER2 receptor
and downstream signaling pathways such as tyrosine
kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors among others

regulation of genes as the chemokine CXCL10, involved in
immune and inflammatory processes and that posses antiangiogenic activity, which are associated with increased
immune infiltration and improved survival in patients
with solid malignancies including breast cancer [36,
37]. On the other hand, genes involved in breast cancer
tumorigenesis such as CLAUDIN1 and E2F8 among
others, were down-regulated after Bozepinib-treatment. It
has been previously suggested that CLAUDIN 1 acts as
a tumor suppressor. However, recent studies have shown
that this protein participates directly in promoting breast
cancer progression, possibly through the alteration of the
expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes,
and actually its down-regulation has been described as a
contribution to the inhibition of breast cancer migration
[38]. The deregulation of the E2F family member of
transcription factors including the E2F8 atypical member,
contributes to oncogenesis and progression. Ectopic
over-expression of E2F8 promoted cell proliferation,
colony formation and tumorigenicity, whereas the E2F8
knockdown inhibited these phenotypes [39] suggesting
that the down-regulation of E2F8 induced by Bozepinib
could contribute to its anti-tumor effect. Moreover, it
has recently been shown that HER2 tumorigenesis and
metastasis are regulated by E2F activator transcription
factors [40].
Surprisingly, Bozepinib induced the downregulation of important genes involved in Notch and Wnt
signaling. These genes contribute to the CSC phenotype
when they are de-regulated [41]. We detected a downregulation of the co-activator Mastermind-like MAML2 protein, which decreases Notch signaling reducing
the primary tumor sphere formation and side population
in MCF-7 cell line, contributing to the decrease in the
number of CSC subpopulations [42]. We also found an
evident down-regulation of the NOTCH 3 gene, which
has recently been involved in the proliferation of both
HER2 positive and negative breast cancer cells, suggesting
that targeted suppression of this signaling pathway may
be a promising strategy for the treatment of determined
HER2-related breast cancers [43, 44]. According to the
proteomic and genomic results obtained after Bozepinib
treatment and considering the recent works relating
HER2 positivity with CSC phenotype in breast cancer
cells with high ALDH activity [45, 46], we decided to
analyze the efficacy of Bozepinib over CSCs enriched
subpopulations. Since there is controversy about the
efficacy of sphere-forming cultures to select CSCs [47,
48] we used ALDH activity to enrich cell cultures with
clonal ability and stem-like properties. Moreover, previous
to the treatment with Bozepinib the in vivo tumorigenic
potential of ALDH+ and the reestablishment of tumor
heterogeneity was demonstrated (data not shown). Our
results showed that Bozepinib inhibited both mamo- and
colono-spheres formation in subpopulations isolated
by ALDH activity. High ALDH activity is associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with metastasis, resistance to chemotherapies and poor
prognosis in human cancers, and it has been identified as
one of the most specific markers of human CSCs [49].
Moreover, Bozepinib was able to induce apoptosis in the
resistant ALDH + subpopulations from both SKBR-3
and HCT-116 cells, although in less degree that the more
sensible ALDH– subpopulations. CSCs are apoptosis
resistant in order to secure the production of progeny
[50] and an apoptosis program is a prerequisite for any
tumor-initiating cell and may support the survival of
CSCs in response to chemo- or radio-therapy. Therefore,
targeted therapies reactivating death program and inducing
apoptosis in CSCs may synergize with established
therapies and increase efficacy in the clinic. In addition,
Bozepinib displayed IC50 values in a similar range to
Salinomycin, which has been described as a selective
and potent drug against CSCs with limited use in human
due to considerable toxicity [21]. Interestingly, we
detected a significant reduction in the level of c-MYC
and β-CATENIN in both breast and colon ALDH+ and
ALDH- cells after Bozepinib treatment. Although most of
these proteins are expressed in normal and differentiated
tumor cells, it has been described that the expression level
of determined genes involved in stem-like properties
determines the CSCs process [51]. In accordance with the
high level of stem signaling proteins described for CSCs,
we detected higher levels of these proteins in the ALDH+
subpopulations in comparison with ALDH- cells. Recently,
it has been reported the cooperation between c-MYC and
HER2 and between c-MYC and β-CATENIN to drive
mammary stem cell amplification and tumorigenesis
[10, 12]. In fact, the down-regulation of c-MYC triggers
the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, invasion and
migration [52]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a critical
role in CSCs, being β-CATENIN a key mediator of Wnt
signaling [53]. Moreover, whereas no detectable levels
of SOX2 protein were present in breast cancer cells, we
detected a considerable level of SOX2 in ALDH-isolated
colon cancer cells that was significantly reduced after
Bozepinib treatment. The transcription factor SOX2 is
involved together with c-MYC, KLF4 and OCT3/4 in the
induction and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells and
has been also associated the expression of both SOX2
and β-CATENIN with metastases and poor prognosis
in colon cancer [15]. Finally, we detected significant
changes in GLI-3 expression in colon cancer cells, a
described target gene transcription repressor of Hedgehog
signaling pathway [22]. Whereas GLI-3 expression was
detected in ALDH- HCT-116 isolated cells, this protein
was not detected in the ALDH+ cells, suggesting that
the Hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in the CSC
phenotype as has been previously described [22]. The
treatment with Bozepinib induced a strong expression of
GLI-3 protein level in both ALDH+ and ALDH- colon
cancer cells. In addition, according to reported data [54],
in our study, the activation of GLI-3 protein corresponded
3601

Oncotarget

with an inactivation of β-CATENIN expression in CSCs
subpopulations after Bozepinib treatment. Since GLI3 over-expression reduced tumor cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis in colon CSCs [55], the GLI-3 induction
by Bozepinib could be one of the mechanisms by which
this drug exerts its anti-tumor activity in colon CSCs that
must be deeply explored.
Although we show promising data proving the
efficacy of Bozepinib over CSCs, the mechanism by
which Bozepinib inhibits the CSC growth requires
further detailed investigation. The Bozepinib effect
involves different pathways and kinases as we described
in a previous work showing the role of the PKR proapoptotic kinase [18], and in the present study by the
inhibition of proliferative signaling pathways. However,
the determination of the impact of every kinase or
every signaling pathway of the drug is not yet known
and probably it is a pleiotropic effect that finally leads
to its effectiveness. Moreover, the specific HER2, JNK
and ERKs inhibition, the anti-angiogenic and antimigration activity together with the in vivo anti-tumor
and anti-metastatic effect and the non-systemic toxicity
of Bozepinib, encourage further studies on the therapeutic
potential of this novel synthetic compound in breast and
colon cancer patients.

and 100ng/ml cholera toxin. HUVEC were cultured in
endothelial growth medium (EGM-2; Lonza). All cell
lines listed above were tested for authentication using the
short-tandem repeat profiling and were passaged for less
than 6 months, and routinely assayed for mycoplasma
contamination.

In vitro cytotoxicity assays
The effect of anticancer drugs on cell viability was
assessed using the sulforhodamine-B colorimetric assay.
Briefly, cells (1×103 cells/well) were seeded onto 24well plates and incubated for 24 h and then treated with
different Bozepinib concentrations. Three days later, wells
were aspirated, fresh medium and drug were added, and
cells were maintained for 3 additional days. Cells were
maintained with the drug for six days. Thereafter, cells
were processed as previously described [56], using a
Titertek Multiscan apparatus (Flow, Irvine, California) at
492 nm. We evaluated the linearity of the SRB assay with
a cell number for each cell line before every cell growth
experiment. The IC50 values were calculated from semilogarithmic dose-response curves by linear interpolation.
All of the experiments were plated in triplicate wells and
were carried out at least twice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Kinase inhibition assays

Drugs and treatments

The kinase inhibition profile of Bozepinib
was determined using a panel of 36 protein kinases
(Supplementary Table S1). Residual activity values were
measured by testing each compound at two concentrations
(5×10-5 M and 5×10-6 M) in singlicate for each kinase
assay. Detailed methods for kinome analyses are provided
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

(RS)-2,6-Dichloro-9-[1-(p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4,1-benzoxazepin-3-yl]-9H-purine
(Bozepinib) was synthesized as previously described
[17], dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20 ºC. For each
experiment, the stock solutions were further diluted in
medium to obtain the desired concentrations. The final
solvent concentration in cell culture was ≤ 0.1% v/v of
DMSO, a concentration without effect on cell replication.
Parallel cultures of cells in medium with DMSO were used
as controls.

MTS cell viability assay
Enriched subpopulations of CSCs were seeded
in a concentration of 3000 cells/well in 96-well plates
in sphere forming medium and treated with different
Bozepinib concentrations. After 72 h, 10 μl of CellTiter
96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay,
MTS (10 mg/ml) (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA)
was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 2-4 h.
Plates were read at 570 nm on a Bio-Rad plate reader.

Cell lines
The four human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7,
MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB 231, SKBR-3 and the five
human colon cancer cell lines Caco-2, T-84, HT-29, SW480, HCT-116 were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 10% FBS. Non-tumoral cell lines MCF-10A (breast)
and CCD-18Co (colon) obtained from ATCC were
cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5%
horse serum (HS), 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.02 µg/
ml epithelial growth factor (EGF), 0.01 µg/ml insulin

Apoptosis analysis
Cells were plated in six-well plates and after
treatment were trypsinized and analyzed using an
Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate detection kit
(eBioscience Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The samples
were immediately processed using a FACSAria III flow

cytometer (Becton Dickinson, BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) from the Scientific Instrumental Center
(University of Granada).

Total RNA from the different cell lines was extracted
from duplicate 80% confluent cultures using the TRIZOL
reagent following the instructions of the manufacturer
(Life Technologies). cDNA was synthesized by reverse
transcrition of total RNA using the Reverse Transcription
System (Promega) and qRT-PCR assay was done using
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Promega) and random
primers. Each reaction was performed in triplicate from
two cDNA dilutions. The comparative threshold cycle (Ct)
method was used to calculate the amplification factor as
specified by the manufacturer. Human GADPH was used
as an internal standard to normalize variations in RNA
quality in the quantities of input cDNA. The amount of
target and endogenous reference was determined from a
standard curve for each experimental sample. The standard
curve was constructed by 5-fold serial dilutions of cDNA
from 1 μg. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.

Western blotting
For attached cell lines, cells were seeded on 6-well
plates in their respective medium. After treatment,
medium was removed from attached cells and floating
CSCs spheres were centrifugated at 1500 rpm, washed
twice with PBS and then lysed in Laemmli buffer.
Immunoblotting on whole cell lysates was performed
following routine protocols [18]. All antibodies used for
western blot analysis are listed in the Supplementary
Material and Methods.

Functional capillary formation assays
The ability of Bozepinib to inhibit capillaries in
semisolid medium was tested in HUVEC using a Matrigel
assay (see Supplementary Material and Methods).

Isolation of CSCs

Wound-healing assay

Cancer stem-like cells from SKBR-3 breast and
HCT-116 colon cancer cells lines were isolated using
the ALDEFLUOR assay (StemCell Technologies)
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (see
Supplementary Material and Methods) and enriched
subpopulation of CSCs were grown with a specific sphereforming medium in ultralow attachment plates (Corning)
as previously described [49].

Breast and colon cancer cells were seeded in 6-well
plates and grown to 80% confluence. Wounds were created
by scraping monolayer cells with a 200 µl (for HCT-116)
and 1000 µl (for SKBR-3) pipette tip, and non-adherent
cells were washed off with medium. At 0, 24 and 48 h after
the creation of wounds, Bozepinib-treated and control
non-treated cells were observed and photographed with
a 10× objective in a phase-contrast microscopy. Wound
distances were measured at each time point and expressed
as the average percent of wound closure by comparing
the zero time. Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was used to
quantify the wound area. All experiments were plated in
triplicate wells and were carried out at least three times.

In vivo sub-acute toxicity and anti-tumor
xenograft studies
Sub-acute toxicity was determined in six weeks
old BALBC/c female (n=20) during 29 days. Bozepinib
dissolved in methylcellulose 1% was administered in
a single i.p. bolus injection at 100 mg/kg twice a week.
Control mice were (n=10) inoculated with the same
volume of methylcellulose. Mice were maintained under
standard conditions and for each treatment schedule, were
weighed and assessed twice weekly for systemic toxicity
(listlessness, weight loss) and local toxicity (alopecia, skin
reaction, and leg motility).
To establish xenograft tumors six- to eightweek old female BALB/c nude mice (Charles Rives
Laboratories) were used. All procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the University of Granada. They were housed and
maintained at 20°C to 24°C, 50% RH, a 14 to 10 h lightdark cycle with food and water ad libitum. The HT-29 and
MDA-MB 468 tumors were generated by subcutaneous
injections of 2×106 cells/mouse using 26-gauge needles.

Microarray analysis
MDA-MB 468 cells were treated with 5 µM
Bozepinib for 4 h and 16 h. No treated cells were used
as control. Total RNAs were extracted using Quiagen
extraction Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA microarray analyses were carried out with the
Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays according to the
Affymetrix standard protocol. The gene list with x-fold
cut-off was then subdivided into functional categories
with the bioinformatic analysis resource DAVID (NCI,
Frederick, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). Gene pathway
analysis was also conducted by DAVID and Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis (IPA, https://www.ingenuity.com/).

Tumors were allowed to grow to an average volume of
100 mm3. Animals (n= 8 per group) were then randomly
assigned as control and treatment groups and treated
with methylcellulose 1% (control vehicle) or Bozepinib
(25 mg/kg, dissolved in methylcellulose 1%) injected
i.p. three times a week for 45 days for MDA-MB 468
and two weeks for HT-29. Tumor weight was calculated
according to the formula: TW (mg) = tumor volume (mm3)
= d2 × D/2, where d and D are the shortest and longest
diameters, respectively. Paraffin-embedded blocks of all
tumors were sectioned at 5 μm. Each sample was stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathologic
analysis.
