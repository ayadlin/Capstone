ABSTRACT
Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) are small molecules in development as
anti-cancer agents. The first-in-class SINE, selinexor, is in clinical trials for blood and solid
cancers. Selinexor forms a covalent bond with exportin-1 at cysteine-528, and blocks
its ability to export cargos. Previous work has shown strong cell cycle effects and druginduced cell death across many different cancer-derived cell lines. Here, we report strong
cell cycle-associated DNA double-stranded break formation upon the treatment of cancer
cells with SINE. In multiple cell models, selinexor treatment results in the formation of
clustered DNA damage foci in 30-40% of cells within 8 hours that is dependent upon
cysteine-528. DNA damage strongly correlates with G1/S-phase and decreased DNA
replication. Live cell microscopy reveals an association between DNA damage and cell
fate. Cells that form damage in G1-phase more often die or arrest, while those damaged
in S/G2-phase frequently progress to cell division. Up to half of all treated cells form
damage foci, and most cells that die after being damaged, were damaged in G1-phase.
By comparison, non-transformed cell lines show strong cell cycle effects but little DNA
damage and less death than cancer cells. Significant drug combination effects occur when
selinexor is paired with different classes of agents that either cause DNA damage or that
diminish DNA damage repair. These data present a novel effect of exportin-1 inhibition
and provide a strong rationale for multiple combination treatments of selinexor with
agents that are currently in use for the treatment of different solid cancers.

hours of SINE treatment, cargo sequestration, cell cycle
arrest and progression defects, and activation of apoptosis
are observed [10, 13]. Flow cytometry experiments in several
studies report G1-phase accumulation and a rapid loss of the
S-phase population after inhibition of XPO1 [13]. It is unclear
from these studies what the fates of the cells accumulating in
G1/S-phase are: progression and division, arrest, or death.
Cell cycle effects and apoptosis occur in many different
cancer-derived cell lines and xenograft models with SINE,
indicating potential broad efficacy of XPO1 as an anti-cancer
target [8, 13, 14]. Single cell longitudinal tracking using the
fluorescent ubiquitin cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system in
HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells shows that after acute treatment
with selinexor (KPT-330) many cells treated in G1-phase

INTRODUCTION
Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) are a
first-in-class family of compounds with potential clinical
application in different disease states, including inflammation,
autoimmunity, ALS and cancers [1–6]. SINE action works
through direct, slowly-reversible covalent binding to the
karyopherin exportin-1 (XPO1/CRM1) at cysteine-528
located in the cargo-binding cleft [7–9]. SINE binding to
XPO1 prevents access of the cargo nuclear export sequence
(NES) to the binding pocket, resulting in the subsequent
nuclear accumulation and retention of cargo proteins [9].
Numerous studies use SINE to probe the anti-cancer
potential of inhibiting XPO1 function [8, 10–12]. Within

exhibit G1-phase cell cycle arrest associated with cell death
[10]. Some cells treated in G1-phase progress to cell division.
These cells, and those treated in early S-phase, often show a
protracted S-phase progression that is at least 2-fold longer
than untreated cells, and some of these cells die in S-phase
[10]. Cell stresses that may account for arrest and cell death
in G1-phase and S-phase associated phenotypes –or– that in
turn may be caused by abnormal S-phase progression, are
unclear after selinexor treatment.
DNA damage can cause cell cycle arrest and death
[15, 16]. Likewise, abnormal DNA synthesis can result
in DNA double-stranded breaks and S-phase arrest or
progression defects [17–19]. Our and other’s observations
of G1-phase arrest and S-phase effects after SINE
treatment prompted us to examine if there is a relationship
between inhibition of XPO1 with SINE and DNA doublestranded damage.

double-stranded DNA damage in 35-40% of cells via
immunostaining for the phosphorylated serine-139 histone
variant H2A.X (γH2A.X) (Figure 1). Three different
SINE compounds – selinexor (KPT-330), KPT-8602, and
KPT-185 – each cause foci formation to the same extent
(Figure 1C). The tool compound KPT-301, the inactive
trans isomer of KPT-185, at 1μM shows no increase in the
number of cells with DNA damage foci over mock treated
cells (0.05% DMSO) (data not shown).
Many previous studies use 1μM to study SINE
response and it can be achieved in vivo [8, 11, 20]. Unless
noted otherwise, selinexor is used. In HT-1080, foci formation
after selinexor treatment peaks after 8 hours and remains
elevated over mock at 24 hours (Figure 2). In addition to HT1080 cells, MCF7 breast carcinoma, U2OS osteosarcoma,
HCT116 colon carcinoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and
PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma, cells show DNA damage foci
after treatment with selinexor (Supplementary Figure 1A-1J).
Interestingly, two proliferative, non-transformed human cell
lines, telomerase immortalized retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE1) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), show no strong
increase in γH2A.X foci staining after treatment with 1μM
selinexor (Supplementary Figure 1K-1P).
SINE molecules bind to XPO1 via the cysteine-528
residue [7–9]. To validate that DNA damage formation
is specific to XPO1 inhibition by SINE, we transfected
cells and expressed XPO1 mutated from a cysteine to a
serine at residue 528 (XPO1 C528S). XPO1 C528S cannot
bind SINE but is functional to export cargos [21,  22].
Mutant transfected cells were treated for 8 hours with
selinexor and the number of cells that form the γH2A.X
foci compared to mock transfected cells, transfected cells
expressing soluble mRFP, and transfected cells expressing
wildtype XPO1 was quantified (Figure  3A). Treated
control (1μM selinexor) or XPO1 wildtype expressing
(XPO1, 1μM selinexor) cells show a 4-fold increase in

RESULTS
DNA damage after SINE treatment depends on
XPO1 Cysteine-528
Cell-based effects after XPO1 inhibition by SINE
begin within hours of treatment, including the nuclear
sequestration of cargos, cell cycle effects, and cell death
[6, 10, 12]. The cell cycle effects are complex, including
arrest and progression defects as characterized by flow
cytometry and time-lapse microscopy with longitudinal
tracking of cells [10, 13]. After 8 hours of acute treatment
with SINE, we observe cell cycle progression defects,
including in S-phase cells, before cell death occurs [10].
Cell cycle effects and cell death often associate with
DNA damage. We asked whether DNA damage occurs
after treatment with SINE. Fixed cell analyses of HT1080 cells after 8 hours of SINE indicate dose-dependent

γH2A.X foci formation over untreated (mock) cells after
SINE treatment (Figure 3B–3D, 3F). Cells expressing
the XPO1 C528S mutant show only a 1.5-fold increase
in cells with γH2A.X foci (Figure 3E, 3F). XPO1 C528S
expression also significantly inhibited γH2A.X foci
formation in U2OS cells (Supplementary Figure 2),
further demonstrating that DNA damage formation occurs
downstream of SINE binding to cysteine-528 of XPO1.

We next characterized and validated the γH2A.X
foci in HT-1080 as sites of double-stranded DNA damage.
Co-immunofluorescent staining shows the γH2A.X foci
also label for 53BP1, NBS1, phospho-(S1981)-ATM
and RPA70, which are proteins that mediate the doublestranded DNA damage response (Supplementary Figure
3). Line-scans through representative co-stained foci and
plotting of the fluorescent intensity profiles indicates

these damage response proteins are strongly localized,
supporting these are damaged sites that cells may
attempt to repair (Supplementary Figure 3). Standard,
low-magnification epifluorescence microscopy (e.g. 20X
0.70 NA air objective), shows the γH2A.X stain as dense,
with the structures measuring 1-3 microns in their largest
x-y dimension after 8 hours treatment (e.g. Figure 1B
or Supplementary Figure 3A). It is unclear whether the
structures are a single focus with a large accumulation
of γH2A.X staining, or multiple distinct foci that are
tightly clustered. High magnification (100X, 1.40NA oil)
resolves some structural detail within the γH2A.X foci
(Supplementary Figure 4A). Three-dimensional, high-

resolution SIM with a lateral resolution of approximately
100nm and axial resolution of approximately 300nm
suggests the γH2A.X foci are collections of multiple
smaller, distinct, and clustered foci (Supplementary
Figure 4B). Next, DNA double-stranded breaks were
assessed directly using the neutral comet assay. After 8
hours of treatment with selinexor there is a significant
increase in the length of associated comet tails and in
the comet tail moment compared to spontaneous damage
in control cells, indicating increased double-stranded
damage to a similar extent using these measures as is
caused by 8 hours of 10μM etoposide (Supplementary
Figure 4C-4G).

compared to 25% of EdU negative cells. Error bars are the SEM from two replicate experiments, at least 100 cells measured for each time

DNA damage associates with G1-phase and
S-phase cells, and decreased DNA replication

per cell begins to decrease after 2 hours of selinexor
exposure (Figure 4D), suggesting a rapid impact on
S-phase progression, and by 24 hours, it is negligible.
EdU – γH2A.X foci correlation analysis indicates a
positive association between positive, but decreased EdU
labeling and the presence of γH2A.X foci, that increases
until 8 hours after treatment (Figure 4E). EdU negative
cells in the same treated population show no strong
association with γH2A.X foci status, but it does appear
to somewhat increase over time compared to the EdU
negative cells in the mock treated population (Figure
4E), indicating dead cells or that at least some cells with
foci become arrested. In U2OS cells, selinexor treatment
also results in decreased DNA replication based on EdU
incorporation, and γH2A.X foci associate strongly with
S-phase status after 8 hours of treatment (Supplementary
Figure 8); foci are present in approximately 30% of cells
fixed after 8 hours of treatment. EdU incorporation in
cells is nearly absent altogether after a 24 hour treatment
(Supplementary Figure 8A). These results in U2OS are
consistent with HT-1080. Taken together, the FUCCI and
EdU data indicate an association between DNA damage
formation and the cell cycle, but the precise timing of
the damage cannot be resolved nor does it allow for the
direct determination of cell fate in cells with and without
damage.

DNA damage can occur throughout the cell
cycle, leading to different cellular responses, including
cell cycle arrest and death. We first sought to define if
γH2A.X foci are cell cycle associated after treatment with
selinexor. Using the FUCCI reporter system [10, 23, 24],
etoposide (topoisomerase IIα; S/G2-phase inhibition)
and PD-0332991 (Cdk4/6; G1-phase inhibition) controls
confirm the reporters accurately report on cell cycle phase
(Supplementary Figure 5A and [10]). FUCCI expressing
HT-1080 cells treated with selinexor for 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24
hours were fixed and stained for DNA and γH2A.X. Nuclei
with the γH2A.X foci are classified as red only (G1-phase),
red and green (yellow, G1/S-phase), and green only (S/G2phase) (see Methods); cells in mitosis are excluded from
this analysis. At 2 hours treatment, 15-20% of cells show the
γH2A.X foci (Figure 2B); at this time, approximately 60%
of cells are in G1- or G1/S-phase, regardless of damage
status (Supplementary Figure 5A). Over time, the combined
percentage of G1- or G1/S-phase cells with foci is relatively
constant (Supplementary Figure 5B). In contrast to cells
with the γH2A.X foci, cells without DNA damage foci in
the same population, shifts persistently and strongly to a
G1-phase (red) state over time (Supplementary Figure 5C),
in agreement with the cell cycle arrest observed for this cell
line previously [10]. We also calculated the fraction of each
FUCCI class with γH2A.X foci over time. Between 2–8
hours after treatment, the fraction of G1- and G1/S-phase
cells with foci increases from approximately 0.25 to 0.55,
before decreasing at 16 and 24 hours (Supplementary Figure
5D). The fraction of S/G2-phase cells with the γH2A.X foci
accumulates after 4 hours, and remains elevated at 24 hours
when approximately 70% of the total population is in a G1phase state (Supplementary Figure 5D and 5A). These data
support that foci can form in G1- and S-phase, and may
associate with prolonged S-phase and/or S/G2-phase arrest.
Normal RPE1 cells do not accumulate DNA damage foci
(Supplementary Figure 1L) and respond rapidly to selinexor
treatment by arresting in G1-phase (Supplementary Figure
6 and Supplementary Video 7), similar to the population in
HT-1080 FUCCI that do not form damage (Supplementary
Figure 5C).
DNA damage can cause –or– be caused by S-phase
progression defects [17]. We evaluated a potential
relationship between DNA damage foci and S-phase after
treatment with selinexor (Figure 4A). Following 8 hours
of selinexor treatment, fewer HT-1080 cells are actively
replicating their DNA and replication is significantly
decreased based on quantification of the incorporation
of the nucleotide 5-ethynyl-2’ deoxyuridine (EdU) even after 2 hours of EdU incubation (Figure 4B, 4C,
Supplementary Figure 7). Cells treated in a time course
with selinexor, followed by a 15min EdU pulse, were
co-stained for γH2A.X. The mean incorporation of EdU

Longitudinal tracking shows that nearly 50%
of all cells become damaged, mostly in G1- and
S-phase, and >90% of cells damaged in G1-phase
subsequently die
Fixed cell experiments show DNA damage increases
within hours after treatment with 1μM SINE. For HT1080, the peak percentage of cells with damage occurs
at 8 hours and remains elevated at 24 hours, and the
damage associates with G1- and S-phase (Figure 2, 4 and
Supplementary Figure 7). To precisely define the timing of
DNA damage formation with regard to G1- and S-phase
directly in the same cell, we employed an HT-1080
reporter cell line stably co-expressing the double-stranded
DNA damage probe, mCherry-BP1-2 (red, see Material
and Methods for detail), and the S/G2-phase FUCCI probe,
mAG-hGem(1/110) (green), and time-lapse microscopy
and longitudinal tracking was performed (Figure 5A) [10,
25]. After treatment with SINE, nearly 75% of cells that
form DNA damage do so in G1-phase (absence of green
signal); the remaining 25% are in S/G2-phase (green)
(Figure 5B versus 5C, and Figure 5D). Cells that acquire
DNA damage in G1/S-phase (yellow in FUCCI system,
Supplementary Figure 5) are represented in the S/G2phase population using this reporter cell line. Longitudinal
tracking reveals that close to 50% of all treated cells
acquire damage within the first 24 hours after treatment
with SINE, and approximately half of this occurs by
8 hours (Figure 5F). Timing analysis of damage formation

individually tracked cells. Over 70% of cells that become damaged, are damaged in G1-phase (absence of mAG-hGem(1/110) probe). For cells

in the damaged population indicates a rapid increase to
approximately 15 hours after treatment, in support of a
tight association with the cell cycle (Figure 5G). The cell
cycle association of DNA damage and fraction of treated
cells with damage foci over time suggest these cells are
gradually lost and/or that the damage is repaired (Figures
2, 5 and Supplementary Figure 5 and 8).
When SINE treated cells acquire DNA damage
they are not dead. Rather, cells with DNA damage may
undergo death, cell cycle arrest or senescence, or they
may continue proliferating. Longitudinal tracking of
treated HT-1080 mAG-hGem(1/110)/mCherry-BP1-2 cells
shows that by 48 hours after treatment, 30% of all cells
died and 26% divided (Figure 5D); over 40% of cells are
classified as arrest/undetermined due to the end of imaging
or movement from the analysis field; previous work
indicates these cells may remain arrested [10]. The treated
cell population can be parsed into populations that become
damaged versus those that do not. Cells that acquire
damage are more likely to die (33.9%) than to progress to
cell division (19.1%) (Figure 5D). By comparison, treated
cells that do not acquire damage divide more frequently
(36.5%) than they die (24.3%). SINE treatment causes
death with and without damage, but death is elevated in
cells that become damaged (33.9% versus 24.3%).
Of the damaged cells that die, greater than 90%
show damage initially in G1-phase (Figure 5D); 58.4%
remain in G1-phase and die and 41.6% progress to S/
G2-phase and die (e.g. Supplementary Videos 3 and 2,
respectively). Of the damaged cells that progress to cell
division, 76.2% were damaged in S/G2-phase (Figure
5C, 5D, Supplementary Video 5). Next, we characterized
the timing of DNA damage with relation to S-phase entry
and cell fate for cells that form damage and progress
to S/G2-phase (Figure 5E). For cells that form damage
and die in S/G2-phase, damage most often occurs in
G1-phase, 7-8 hours on average before entering S-phase
(increasing mAG-hGem(1/110) probe). For cells that form
damage and progress to cell division, DNA damage on
average forms 2-3 hours after S-phase entry. The timing
of DNA damage is on average 1-2 hours before entering
S-phase for cells that arrest or whose fate could not be
determined (Figure 5E). The ultimate fate of cells that
acquire DNA damage and maximizing their death is an
important consideration for how to most effectively use
SINE against cancer.

frequency of death than their undamaged counterparts,
over 60% arrest or progress to cell division (Figure
5D). We tested equimolar combinations of selinexor
with multiple different DNA damage agonists in an
attempt to find combination effects that significantly
decrease cell survival. We used nucleoside analogs, a
platinum-based DNA intercalator, a topoisomerase IIα
poison, and a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP1)
inhibitor that are all approved for the treatment of human
cancers in combination with other agents (Figure 6 and
Supplementary Figure 9 and 10). Further, clinical trials
are planned that combine selinexor with these or highly
related chemotherapy compounds (ClinicalTrials.gov).
The median effect model was used to calculate the
combination effects. Both CompuSyn and an R based
analysis package (see methods) were used to calculate
the combination effect indices using ATP as a surrogate
for cell survival (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 10).
Results from both methods were the same, and results
using CompuSyn are shown as it is widely available.
Applying the guidelines of Chou and Martin [29]
regarding drug combination effects, there is significant
synergy (combination index <1.0) of selinexor with each
of these agents in at least some equimolar combinations
(Figure 6A–6D and Supplementary Figure 10B). The
concentrations of selinexor used are 31.25nM-1μM in
each combination series. The other compounds were
used at equimolar ratios depending on the effect of the
compound alone (1:10, 1:1 or 10:1, see Supplementary
Figure 9 and 10).
The nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and 5-FU
show strikingly similar combination effects across the
dose combinations tested (Figure 6A, 6B). Gemcitabine
shows combination indices <1.0 for the four lowest
concentration combinations. We chose concentrations
that were approximately half the EC50 to characterize
the selinexor– gemcitabine combination over time (30nM
selinexor, 3nM gemcitabine) (Figure 6E, Supplementary
Figure 9A). As single agents, there is no significant
decrease in cell survival by 72 hours compared to
untreated. The combination has a significant decrease in
viability compared to untreated cells with an approximate
25% decrease in survival at 48 hours, and nearly a 50%
decrease at 72 hours (Figure 6E).
The DNA intercalator cisplatin combines well
with selinexor at four of the tested combinations
(Figure 6C). The topoisomerase IIα poison, etoposide has
been combined with selinexor in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia [11] and acute myeloid leukemia [27], and also
shows combinations effects here with HT-1080 cells
(Figure 6D). The EC50 for cell survival for cisplatin
and etoposide are approximately 498.7nM and 59.7nM,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 5). The PARP1
inhibitor olaparib combines well with DNA damaging
treatments and other chemotherapies [30, 31] and shows
combination effects with selinexor in triple negative

Multiple classes of agents that compound DNA
damage show combination effects with selinexor
DNA damage is a critical avenue to clinical efficacy
for many cancer treatments, especially in combination
chemotherapies that compound DNA damage to enhance
the anti-cancer effect [26–28]. Nearly 50% of all cells
form DNA damage after treatment with SINE (Figure 5F).

breast cancers cells independent of BRCA1 status [32].
When combined with selinexor in HT-1080 cells (BRCA1
wildtype, [33], olaparib shows combination effects in five
different combinations; olaparib also combines well with
x-irradiation as a positive control, although combination
indices cannot be calculated in this case (Supplementary
Figure 10A-10C). Taken together, selinexor combines well
with chemotherapy agents that each induce double-stranded
DNA damage through distinct molecular mechanisms
(gemcitabine, 5-FU, cisplatin, and etoposide) and that
perturb DNA repair and apoptosis signaling (olaparib).

Treatment of cells with SINE compounds results
in multiple cell fates, including cell cycle arrest, cell
cycle progression defects, and apoptosis [7, 8, 10]. The
mechanisms by which SINE compounds exert these
effects need to be understood if we are to best utilize these
agents to treat cancers. The sequestration of some XPO1
cargos, the functions of some proteins, and gross cell fates
after treatment with SINE indicate that nuclear export is
blocked rapidly and the cell responses are highly complex

Figure 6: Selinexor combines synergistically with different classes of DNA damage agents. HT-1080 cells were treated with

selinexor and the FDA approved therapeutics in equimolar concentrations (A-D) Relative cell survival was detected with CellTiter-Glo
after 72 hours (h). Combination indices for each combination were calculated using the median effect model. The dotted line represents a
combination index of 1. Points less than 1 are synergistic whereas points greater than 1 are antagonistic. (E) A time course with selinexor
or gemcitabine alone and in combination was performed at half the EC50 concentration. Survival at each time point is determined via
normalization to DMSO (mock) treated wells. A significant decrease in survival compared to mock treated is seen at 48 and 72h post
treatment in the combination. Error bars are SEM from 3 experiments. ** is p<0.01 and * is p<0.05.

[6, 10, 20, 34]. For example, recent studies document
decreased ribosome biogenesis [35], disrupted nuclear
architecture of telomeres [36], synthetic lethality with
oncogenic K-Ras [20], and NFκB/IκB regulation after
treatment with SINE [34].
Here, we show that double-stranded DNA damage
occurs in some cells within hours of treatment with SINE
(Figures 1, 2) and longitudinal tracking experiments in
one cell model indicate nearly half of the population
becomes damaged by 24 hours and correlates strongly
with eventual cell death and arrest, particularly if the
damage occurs when cells are in G1-phase (Figure
5). Over time, cells with DNA damage show a strong
association with S-phase based on positive, but decreased
EdU staining (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures 7, 8).
The DNA damage foci stain for multiple DNA damage
repair proteins consistent with double-stranded damage
(Supplementary Figure 3). Indeed, based on single cell
tracking (Figure 5D), while 34% of cells with damage
progress to cell death, 66% appear to either repair
the foci in a protracted S/G2-phase (and divide) (e.g.
Supplementary Video 5) or remain in an arrested state
(Supplementary Video 6).
High-magnification, high-resolution microscopy and
the neutral DNA comet assay reveal there are multiple,
clustered DNA damage foci after treatment with SINE
(Supplementary Figure 4); a small number of breaks
does not generate tails in the comet assay. Notably, the
population of HT-1080 cells at 8 hours of treatment with
SINE that is used in the comet assay contains very few
apoptotic cells [10], indicating the tails are not due to DNA
fragmentation associated with cell death. Cells expressing
the functional XPO1 C528S point mutant that cannot
bind SINE show decreased DNA damage foci formation
compared to cells expressing wildtype XPO1 (Figure 3
and Supplementary Figure 2); DNA damage formation is
not completely inhibited by expression of XPO1 C528S,
likely due to the continued expression of normal XPO1.
These data indicate that SINE binding to XPO1 is causal
to a subsequent mechanism of DNA damage and that the
SINE molecules themselves are not directly causing the
damage.
DNA damage in general can result from many
different mechanisms. The data indicate that multiple,
clustered, double-stranded breaks occur within hours
after treatment with SINE (Figure 2 and Supplementary
Figure 4). Given the pattern of the foci and timing
of their formation it is unlikely that global DNA
replication defects are responsible. It is possible that
an early replicating gene cluster at the G1/S-phase
transition is prone to damage after XPO1 inhibition,
but attempts to co-localize the damage foci with EdU
shows little if any colocalization (not shown). DNA
damage foci localized at telomeres and centromeres are
known [37, 38]. Damage localized with centromeres is
reported to be associated with mitotic defects [38] and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

XPO1 does have reported roles at centrosomes and in
chromosome attachment to the centromere that could
potentially perturb mitosis when inhibited [39, 40].
However, the clustered foci studied here after treatment
with 1μM selinexor are observed to form predominantly
in G1-phase cells without any obvious association with
mitosis (Figure 2, 5, Supplementary Video 4). Telomere
dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) [37] are found in small
numbers in some cell lines growing in culture, label
with double-stranded break markers [41] and associate
with decreased cell proliferation and increased
senescence [42]. It is conceivable that SINE treatment
impacts telomere signaling or length, given that a
component of the telomere cap, TPP1, may bind XPO1
[43]. When TPP1 dominant inhibitors are expressed,
numerous TIF form that are scattered throughout the
nucleus [43]. Further, HT-1080 express telomerase
and telomere length is stable [44], and uncapping by
telomestatin did not cause growth defects until >4 days
[45]. The acute nature of the experiments here and the
pattern of damage staining indicate a telomere-based
mechanism is unlikely. Future work will focus on the
molecular mechanism of DNA damage formation.
DNA damage foci are observed in multiple
cancerous cell lines after selinexor treatment
(Supplementary Figure 1). Interestingly, two noncancer cell lines, RPE1 and MSCs, show no appreciable
increase in damage foci (Supplementary Figure 1).
The identification of underlying sensitizing factors to
DNA damage formation after treatment with selinexor
will make an important future contribution to how
these molecules work on cells. Based on experiments
with RPE1 and MSC cells, one possibility is that at
least some normal cells respond very rapidly to SINE
treatment and arrest in early G1-phase (e.g. RPE1
FUCCI, Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary
Video 7), prior to DNA damage formation, and show
little death. This idea agrees with earlier observations
showing less cytotoxicity of normal cells to selinexor
[8, 12, 46]. Taken together, there is likely a common
mechanism underlying the DNA damage, but it does
not mean that the foci form at the same frequency
or with the same kinetics in all cell lines. This may
be especially true given the G1- and G1/S-phase
association of the damage, that cell cycle progression
is different between cell lines, and that some cells are
more capable of strong G1-phase arrest and DNA repair
than others based on signaling pathways. It is possible
that overall response to selinexor response is directly
affected by the functionality of various XPO1 cargos,
such as p53 [47, 48]. Due to p53 being an XPO1 cargo
involved in cell cycle arrest and cell death after DNA
damage, it will be important to investigate p53 loss of
function as it relates to the DNA damage and cell fate
observed here. Other mechanisms in cancer cells may
also impact response and fate after selienxor treatment.

For example, oncogenic Ras signaling, which impacts
telomere dysfunction, ribosome biogenesis, and DNA
replication, has been observed to decrease cell survival
after selinexor treatment [20, 49, 50].
DNA damage after treatment with SINE correlates
with cell death in 34% of the cells, other cells appear to
repair the damage and continue proliferation or undergo
cell cycle arrest, and still others show no DNA damage,
but also die or arrest (Figure 5, e.g. Supplementary Videos
3, 4, and 6). Cell fate appears to be dependent on the

timing of DNA damage, with death occurring most often
in cells that acquire damage in G1-phase (38%) compared
to those that acquire damage in S/G2-phase (7%) (Figure
7). These features of the response to SINE may enable the
combination effects found when SINE is combined with
different classes of DNA damage agents. Combination
treatments are an essential part of anti-cancer therapies
and are an important part of future research (Figure 7). Of
note, gemcitabine, platinum-based agents, topoisomerase
inhibitors and PARP1 inhibitors are each being evaluated

Figure 7: Summary of cell cycle -associated cell fates after DNA damage in HT-1080. Data from Figure 5 were used to

compile cell fates dependent on when damage occurs in the cell-cycle. More death is seen in cells that acquire damage in G1-phase (total of
38% versus 7% for damage in S/G2-phase). Cells that accumulate damage in S/G2-phase most often progress through mitosis (53% versus
14% for damage in G1-phase). Given the synergistic effects of combining selinexor with DNA damage agonists [see Figure 6], cell death
is increased across the entire population. The mechanisms of optimizing combinatorial effects should be studied, and are hypothesized to
be cell cycle effects caused by either/both compounds, the timing of DNA damage within the cell cycle, and/or the scheduling of drugs to
maximize the combinatorial effects.

with DNA damaging drugs may significantly decrease cell
survival and, optimistically, some combination will result
in a stronger initial response in cancer therapy.

(Cell Signaling 20E3) are used at 1:500 dilution. Other
antibodies are: 53BP1 (Cell Signaling 4937, 1:200), NBS1
(Novus Biologicals 100-143. 1:500), pATM Ser1981
(Millipore 05-740. 1:1000), and RPA-70 (Santa Cruz

secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor 488, 568,
or 647 are from Invitrogen and used at 1:500 dilution. Cells
were grown on #1.5 glass coverslips (VWR 48366-227).
Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for
20 minutes at room temperature, washed at least 3 times in
PBS, permeablized in 0.5% Triton X100 (Sigma) in PBS,
washed at least 3 times in PBS, blocked in 4% BSA in PBS

(Invitrogen) on glass microscope slides (VWR, 16004-422).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and plasmids
HT-1080 (ATCC) are grown in MEM with Earle’s
salts (Corning; 10-010-CV), sodium pyruvate (Sigma),
non-essential amino acids (Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin
(Sigma; P/S), and 10% FBS (Sigma). U2OS are grown
in McCoys5a (Corning; 10-050-CV) with 10% FBS and
1% P/S. MCF7 are grown in RPMI (Corning; 10-040CV), 10% FBS, and 1% P/S. HeLa, PANC-1 and human
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are grown in DMEM
(Sigma; D6429-500ML), 10% FBS, and 1% P/S. RPE1
are grown in DME/F-12 1:1 (Hyclone; SH30023.01), 10%
FBS, and 1% P/S.
MSCs are obtained by a procedure adapted from
Ahfeldt et al. [51]. hiPSCs were cultured feeder free on
Matrigel (Corning; 356234) in chemically defined E8
medium (Thermo; A1517001). For differentiation of
hiPSCs into embryoid bodies, hiPSCs were disaggregated
with 0.5mM EDTA into small clumps containing 5–10
cells and transferred to low-adhesion plastic 6-well dishes
(Costar Ultra Low Attachment; Corning Life Sciences) in
growth medium containing DMEM, 15% KOSR (Thermo;
10828010) and 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo; 35050061). After
7 days, embryoid bodies were collected and replated
on gelatin-coated 6-well dishes in DMEM, 10% FBS,
1% GlutaMAX, 1% P/S. Upon confluency, cells were
trypsinized in 0.25% trypsin:EDTA (Sigma; T4049) and
replated on cell culture dishes and maintained as described
above.
The HT-1080 mAG-hGem(1/110)/mCherry-BP1-2
expressing cell line was engineered by transfecting an
HT-1080 mAG-hGem(1/110) cell line with the mCherryBP1-2 expression plasmid (FuGENE 6, Promega; E2691)
and selection in 1μg/ml puromycin. Cell lines expressing
both probes were obtained via clonal selection in 96 well
plates. The mAG-hGem(1/110) plasmid is from SakaueSawano et al. [23] via material transfer agreement. The
mCherry-BP1-2 plasmid expresses a peptide fragment of
the DNA damage response/transcriptional regulator protein
53BP1 that includes the γH2A.X binding domain and a
mutated, non-functional Tudor domain, but lacks both
BRCT domains. The peptide retains the capacity to localize
to sites of double-stranded DNA damage [41]. mCherryBP1-2 pLPC-Puro was a gift from Titia de Lange (Addgene
plasmid # 19835). Detection of DNA damage response
using mCherry-BP1-2 was confirmed by treating expressing
cells with 10μM etoposide and time-lapse microscopy

Small molecules and treatment of cells
The SINE compounds KPT-185, KPT-330
(selinexor), and KPT-8602 and the inactive KPT185 trans isomer, KPT-301, are from Karyopharm
Therapeutics, Inc. (Newton, MA), and are prepared in
anhydrous DMSO (Sigma, Hybrimax) and used at the
concentrations indicated. Etoposide and gemcitabine
are from Selleckchem, dissolved in DMSO, and used
at the concentrations indicated. Cisplatin (Sigma) is
dissolved in dimethylformamide (Sigma), and used at the
concentrations indicated. 5-Fluorourcil (5-FU) (Sigma)
is dissolved in DMSO and used at the concentrations
indicated. Olaparib (LC laboratories) is dissolved in DMSO
and used at the concentrations indicated. For FUCCI fixed
cell experiments, 10μM Cdk4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991
(Selleckchem) for 16 hours is used as a G1-phase arrest
standard, and 10μM etoposide (Selleckchem) for 8 hours
is used as an S/G2-phase arrest standard as previously
described for HT-1080 cells[10]. Cells are approximately
70% confluent at the time of drug treatments.

Microscopy, FUCCI scoring, cell tracking, and
quantification
Fixed cell, immunofluorescence microscopy was
performed using an inverted Olympus IX81 microscope
39471

Oncotarget

with Prior Lumen200 Pro metal halide lamp, Hamamatsu
ORCA R2 CCD camera, motorized Prior ProScan III
stage, and 20X 0.70NA, 40X 0.75NA, and 100X oil
immersion 1.40NA objectives using optical filters for
DAPI (Chroma), Alexa488/EGFP (Chroma), Alexa568/
mCherry (Chroma) and Alexa647/Cy5 (Semrock). Highresolution, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) was
performed using a Nikon A1/N-SIM microscope with
100X oil immersion 1.49NA TIRF objective and 405,
488, 561, and 647 lasers and optical filters from Chroma.
SIM images were reconstructed using Nikon Elements
software. Two investigators scored the FUCCI status
in fixed cell experiments. Briefly, nuclei (DAPI) were
identified using the Analyze Particles tool in FIJI (NIH).
Fluorescence intensity values in the red and green channels
were measured and based on signal over background cells
were scored as G1- (red), G1/S (yellow), or S/G2-phase
(green). For DNA damage foci in fixed cells, the “Find
Maxima” tool in FIJI using appropriate thresholding based
on positive control cells treated with 10μM etoposide to
isolate DNA damage foci above background was used,
and cells were scored as positive or negative. Live-cell
microscopy was performed using an inverted Olympus
IX81, 20X 0.70NA objective, and stage-top incubation
chamber (InVivo Scientific) as described previously (see
[10, 21]). Autofocusing was performed using phasecontrast. To minimize acquisition delay between green
and red channels, EGFP/mCherry dual optical filters
(Semrock) and filter wheels were used. Control conditions
are included in each experiment to confirm normal growth.
Two investigators independently tracked all live cells.
For DNA damage foci formation, puncta matching the
properties of those found in fixed cells were identified
by eye and validated by a second investigator. Each cell
was tracked longitudinally and fates were defined as; 1)
death, cell rounding accompanied with blebbing and cell
fragmentation, 2) arrest, cells remain in interphase, and 3)
cell division, cell enters mitosis and completes division.
The cell numbers analyzed in each case are provided in
the respective figure legends.

box and whisker plots, the median is indicated. Significant
differences between the populations are calculated using a
two-tailed student’s T-test. Comet number is >100 for each
condition from two experiments.

Drug combination effects
Selinexor was combined with gemcitabine, 5-FU,
etoposide, cisplatin, or olaparib. Briefly, 500-1000 HT1080 cells were plated into 96 well white-walled plates
(Thermo Scientific) with glass or optical plastic bottoms,
grown overnight, and treated with the indicated conditions
for 72 hours. ATP luminescence (CellTiter-Glo 2.0,
Promega) was read using a Biotek plate reader within 10
minutes of sample preparation. Effects on cell survival
over equimolar dose combinations were calculated using
the median effect model [53, 54]. Statistical modeling
of combination effects was determined using a script in
R based on previous methods, and using the software
package CompuSyn [29, 55, 56]. For the selinexor and
gemcitabine combination, luminescence values were also
measured at 24, 48, and 72 hours. For an x-irradiation
control, cells in 96 well plates were exposed to 3 Gy.

Neutral DNA comet assay
The Trevigen DNA comet assay kit was used
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, drug
treated cells are resuspended with 0.5% Trypsin and 3x106
cells/ml were suspended into low melting point agarose.
Cells were placed onto glass slides provided with the kit.
Prepared slides were placed in 1X TAE running buffer
and electrophoresed at 22 volts for 35 minutes, per the
manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was stained using Sybr
Gold (Invitrogen). Glass coverslips were mounted on top
of the sample using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent. DNA
comets were imaged using an Olympus IX81 inverted
epifluorescence microscope and 10X 0.40NA objective
with a YFP filter set (Omega). Tail length and tail moment
