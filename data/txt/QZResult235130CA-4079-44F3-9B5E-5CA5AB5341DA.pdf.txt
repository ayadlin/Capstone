ABSTRACT
Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a late cell cycle gene that plays a crucial role in
carcinogenesis and chemotherapeutic drug resistance. In this study, the impact of
FOXM1 expression on patient outcome was investigated for the first time in formalin
fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples of chemotherapy naïve muscle-invasive
bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. Expression analyses were performed on the Mannheim
cohort (n=84) and validated on the independent Chungbuk cohort (n=61). In a Cox’
proportional hazards model, a distinct FOXM1 expression cut-off dividing both cohorts
in a ‘high-risk’ and ‘low-risk’ group has been determined. Multivariate analyses
showed that FOXM1 is an independent risk factor for outcome prediction superior to
the TNM system. The FOXM1 ‘high-risk’ group had a 4- to 7-fold increased risk of death
(p<0.03) and presented further an overexpression of MKI67. Recent studies showed
that MIBCs can be subclassified in breast cancer-like subtypes: basal, luminal and
p53-like. Here we demonstrated that FOXM1 was differentially expressed between
MIBC subtypes concordant to its subtype specific expression in breast cancer. Since
the proto-oncogene FOXM1 is known to play an important role in cisplatin resistance
and to be a promising drug target, this study supports FOXM1 as a crucial biomarker
in the personalization of MIBC therapy and urges prospective translational studies.

invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC) account only for about
30-40% of the cases, they present the poorest outcome [2].
Patients with metastatic carcinoma have a 5-year overall
survival rate of approximately 20% [3]. Additionally, due
to the high costs of transurethral resections, cystectomies,

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer is one of the 10 most common
malignancies worldwide with nearly 386,000 new cases
and nearly 150,200 deaths per year [1]. While, musclewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapies and the often necessary lifelong
surveillance, bladder cancer is one of the most expensive
cancer entities averaged over all US citizens [4].
The current standard of care in MIBC is radical
cystectomy. High risk patients are frequently treated with
a perioperative platin-based chemotherapy. At the moment,
the diagnostic and therapy of MIBC suffers from at least
two major problems. First, the therapy selection is heavily
influenced by an insufficient clinicopathologic staging
system for survival and therapy response prediction,
as clinical understaging occurs in 46% of the cases
[5]. Second, unlike in other tumor entities, there are no
prognostic biomarkers established in the clinical routine.
Yet, the search for biomarkers may improve prognostication
and personalization of bladder cancer therapy and may pave
the way to new targeted neoadjuvant therapy options [6].
In this context, several studies subclassified MIBC through
gene expression profiling [7–9]. Those studies identified
distinct molecular subtypes which correlated well with
outcome and therapy response and were similar to the
molecular phenotypes of breast cancer.
The forkhead box M1 gene is known to be involved
in many of the hallmarks of carcinogenesis, e.g. cell
cycle progression, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, cell migration, genomic instability and
formation of tumor metastasis [10–15]. Its expression is
negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor gene TP53
and its downstream gene signature seems to be enriched
in the SCC-like and Genomically Unstable bladder cancer
subtype as defined by Sjödahl et al. [16–18]. FOXM1
is also associated with resistance development against
numerous anti-cancer drugs (e.g. cisplatin, paclitaxel,
docetaxel, gefitinib, epirubicin and trastuzumab) [19–25].
Meta-analyses showed that overexpression of
FOXM1 was associated with poor prognosis in many
solid cancers such as breast, gastric, non-small-cell
lung, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma [26–32].
FOXM1 has been shown to be overexpressed on mRNA
level as well as on protein level in bladder cancer cells in
comparison with normal urothelial cells [15].
This study investigates for the first time the impact
of FOXM1 expression on outcome prediction and risk
stratification in two independent MIBC cohorts. The
Mannheim cohort includes patients treated exclusively
by cystectomy in order to investigate the genuine cours
of disease for patients with high versus low FOXM1
expression. The Chungbuk cohort includes patients with
adjuvant cisplatin therapy in order to investigate the role of
FOXM1 expression in the context of cisplatin resistance.
Recent transcriptome expression studies showed the
existence of molecular subtypes (basal, luminal and p53like) similar to breast cancer molecular phenotypes.
In this context, FOXM1 was tested for differential
expression in the luminal, basal and p53-like bladder
cancer subtypes [7, 8]. In this study, the latter has been
renamed as, non-luminal non-basal’ (NLNB) given the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lack of validation concerning this MIBC subtype [33]. As
FOXM1 is a druggable proto-oncogene, the elucidation of
its impact on bladder cancer survival may contribute to a
further personalization of future MIBC therapy [34].

RESULTS
Cohort characteristics
Clinicopathologic characteristics of the Mannheim
and the Chungbuk cohort are listed in Table 1 and
Table 2. The 10-year overall survival (OS), disease
specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival
(PFS) of 84 patients with MIBC enrolled in the Mannheim
cohort were 35%, 50% and 41% respectively. From the
Chungbuk cohort (n=165) only patients with muscleinvasive carcinoma were selected, resulting in a cohort of
61 patients with a 10-year OS, DSS and PFS of 40%, 45%
and 49% respectively. In the Mannheim cohort, patients
were exclusively treated with radical cystectomy and
lymphadenectomy in contrast to the Chungbuk cohort,
where 43% of the patients received adjuvant systemic
chemotherapy after radical cystectomy or transurethral
resection (TUR). The risk stratification according to a
high or low expression of FOXM1 resulted in an equal
distribution of patient characteristics in both cohorts
between risk groups, except for low grade tumors in the
Chungbuk cohort, which correlated significantly with low
FOXM1 expression (p=0.023). Comparing tumor stage
and grade, the Mannheim cohort included more advanced
disease features.

FOXM1 is an independent risk factor for
survival prediction
The qRT-PCR analyses of the Mannheim cohort
yielded a FOXM1 expression range from 30.7 to 35.5 (40dCT) (median: 33.5) after normalization to the housekeeping
gene CALM2. The FOXM1 cut-off value of 33.1 (40-dCt)
showed best discrimination between a high risk and a low
risk group. In order to determine the impact of FOXM1
expression on OS, DSS and PFS, we performed Cox’s
regression analysis, adjusted for grade, gender, TNM, therapy
and low versus high FOXM1 expression (Table 3). The risk
stratification between low and high FOXM1 expression
allowed a concise discrimination between a high risk and
low risk group. Multivariate analysis showed that patients
with high FOXM1 expression have a 4- to 7-fold higher risk
of death, by means of OS and DSS respectively (p<0.003).
This risk stratification displayed higher HR than lymph node
metastasis and tumor stage in the context of OS and DSS.
Thus, FOXM1 presented an independent risk factor for MIBC
survival prediction. The Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a
10-year DSS of high-risk versus low-risk patients according
to FOXM1 expression of 40% versus 67% (p=0.017) and a
10-year OS of 22% versus 58% (p=0.04, Figure 1). However,

were strong survival predictors. FOXM1 was the only
parameter that was found as an independent risk factor
in the Mannheim and Chungbuk cohort for both OS and
DSS (p<0.03).

Validation of the FOXM1 risk stratification in
the chungbuk cohort

Subtype specific expression of FOXM1

Despite of the differences in MIBC therapy and
expression quantification methods, we managed as a
first validation to define a clear FOXM1 cut-off in the
Chungbuk cohort. Moreover the hazard ratios of the
Chungbuk cohort for OS and DSS correlated with the risk
stratification of the Mannheim cohort (Table 4). Indeed
the FOXM1 log2 cut-off value of 9.7 (range: 7.1-11.6,
median: 9.3) allowed a dichotomization of the cohort
in a low risk group with low FOXM1 expression and
a high risk group with high FOXM1 expression. In the
multivariate analysis, adjusted for the same parameters
as in the Mannheim cohort, the risk of death is up to 3
times higher in the high risk group for OS and DSS
(p<0.03, Table 4). The Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a
4-year DSS of high-risk versus low-risk patients of 20%
versus 57% (p=0.006) and a 4-year OS of 20% versus
49% (p=0.024, Figure 2). PFS showed no statistical
significance in the log rank test (p=0.4). In both cohorts
tumor grade (G2 versus G3) was not an independent risk
factor whereas lymph node metastasis and tumor stage

Recent studies showed that muscle-invasive bladder
cancer can be subclassified similarly to the molecular
phenotypes of breast cancer into basal, luminal and
NLNB subtypes. These subtypes have presented an
impact on patient outcome and a differential expression
of drug targets (e.g. ERBB2-3, FGFR1-4, ESR1) [7–9].
For MIBC subclassification, subtype specific genes from
consensus data tested in silico for subtype enrichment
were collected [33, 35, 36]. For both cohorts, we used a
7-gene panel for MIUC subtyping consisting in a curated
luminal (KRT20, GATA3), basal (KRT5, KRT6A, CDH3)
and NLNB (SORBS1, CNN1) gene signature. These genes
formed consistent clusters throughout cohorts, as shown in
Figure 3 and 4.
In the Mannheim cohort, FOXM1 showed a
significant differential expression between subtypes, in
particular a low expression in the p53-like subtype in
comparison to the luminal and basal subtype (p=0.007,
Figure 3B). These data were confirmed by the Chungbuk

cohort, revealing as well a significant downregulation
in the NLNB subtype (p=0.001, Figure 4B). The NLNB
subtype is known to show good prognosis and to present
immune infiltrative characteristics which may contribute
to a dilution of the measured FOXM1 transcript level and
thus distort the FOXM1 risk stratification [7, 37]. As a
consequence the degree of immune infiltration was tested

expression (Supplementary Figure 1, p>0.05).

FOXM1 expression in the Mannheim cohort (p=0.001).
The same tendency could be observed in the Chungbuk
cohort but without significance (p=0.167, Figure 5). The
NLNB subtype, known to have a favorable outcome,
presented the lowest MKI67 expression (Figure 4B).
The Mannheim cohort confirmed this trend but without
statistical significance (p=0.074, Figure 3B).

Differential expression of MKI67 between
FOXM1 risk groups and MIBC subtypes

DISCUSSION
The impact of the FOXM1 gene expression on
survival has been investigated on a large scale of solid
tumors and was associated with poor prognosis throughout
these studies [26]. In the present study the prognostic
value of FOXM1 has been evaluated for the first time in
urothelial bladder cancer.

As reported in previous studies FOXM1 regulates
cell proliferation and invasion. Therefore we further
investigated the differential expression of the proliferation
marker MKI67 between the risk groups and MIBC
subtypes (Figure 3–5). The expression of MKI67,

FOXM1 allowed a consistent risk stratification and was
confirmed to be an independent risk factor in multivariate
Cox’ regression analysis. As mentioned above, high
expression of FOXM1 had already been confirmed
to be related to bad prognosis in many other cancer
entities. From a biological point of view this seems
plausible given the many roles of this protooncogene in
cancerogenesis [26, 38].

In the Mannheim cohort 64% of the patients were
ranked in the high risk group in contrast to the 16% of
the Chungbuk cohort. Whether this is due to different
quantification methods or therapy options between both
cohorts remained unclear. However, this may partly be
explained by the positive correlation of FOXM1 with
cell proliferation, which enhances chemosensitivity [39].
Yet, exceeding a certain transcript level of FOXM1 may
constitute a point of no return for resistance development.
The Chungbuk cohort showed further 31% low grade
tumors despite the selection of muscle invasive (>T2)
tumors. As MIBC are rarely low grade, we cannot explain
this high percentage.
In both cohorts tumor grade was not an independent
risk factor. Tumor grade is known to have lower impact
in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, as these tumors are
mainly high-grade. Furthermore, radical cystectomy
diminishes its predictive power [40–42]. In concordance
with previous studies, lymph node metastasis and tumor
stage were strong predictors in both cohorts [30]. Large
scale studies showed MKI67 to be a valuable biomarker
for outcome prediction in localized urothelial carcinoma
but provided in advanced bladder cancer no additional
information in comparison to tumor stage in advanced
bladder cancer [43, 44]. Also in this study, MKI67 has not
been retained in multivariate analyses.
In order to further investigate the translational impact
of FOXM1 in MIBC, we analyzed its expression in the recent
context of MIBC subclassification. We showed that FOXM1
is consistently enriched in the basal and luminal subtypes
and suppressed in the NLNB subtype. These findings can
be paralleled with data concerning the basal breast cancer
subtype (triple negative), which also showed a FOXM1
overexpression and a poorer outcome [45–47]. Interestingly,
our findings showed a considerable down regulation of
FOXM1 in a MIBC subclass characterized by an activated
signature of TP53 downstream genes [7]. Those have already
been shown to be influential transcription factors in the
downregulation of FOXM1 [16]. Thus, an overexpression
of this proto-oncogene may be a surrogate marker for
TP53 pathway inactivation, which is often associated with
alterations common in aggressive urothelial carcinoma and
correlates with the poor outcome of basal and luminal MIBC
as described in recent studies [7, 16, 48, 49]. However, Choi
et al. showed that the p53-like subtype had the highest rate
of cisplatin non-responders. Considering the proliferation
marker KI67, the NLNB subtype seemed to present a more
quiescent subtype, which might have led to the described
cisplatin resistance and thus present a FOXM1 independent
resistance mechanism. On the other hand, this hypothesis
needs further validation as the FOXM1 expression in the
NLNB subtype may be diluted by inflammatory cells, though
immune markers showed no enrichment in the FOXM1 low
expression group in this study [37].
The in vitro knockdown of FOXM1 in a bladder
cancer cell line showed a decrease of cell migration and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proliferation [15, 45]. The same has been shown for the
triple negative basal breast cancer cells [45]. In accordance
with this, MKI67 has been positively correlated with
FOXM1 expression in the Mannheim cohort (p=0.01),
indicating a higher proliferation in MIBCs of the high
risk group (Figure 5). Also of note is the presence of
different FOXM1 isoforms, with FOXM1b exclusively
expressed in cancer cells and FOXM1c with enhanced
transforming potential [50]. As in this study all isoforms
were covered by the different quantification methods,
further investigations are warranted.
MIBC patients of our high risk group may profit
from various direct FOXM1 inhibitors like siomycin A,
thiostrepton and bortezomib [51, 52]. As luminal and
basal bladder cancer subtypes are suspected to present a
subtype specific overexpression of other well known drug
targets like the FGFR, EGFR and ERBB gene families,
the number of promising personalized therapy options
rises for FOXM1 enriched MIBC [36]. The potential
role in chemotherapy resistance against cisplatin, argues
for further translational investigations on potential
interactions of FOXM1 with current treatment options. As
this biomarker improved survival prediction, FOXM1 may
be integrated in future biomarker panels for molecular
characterization of bladder cancer. Given the different
quantification platforms between cohorts in this study,
further prospective validation is needed. It has further been
shown that elevated FOXM1 transcript levels in bladder
cancer correlated with its protein expression. Thus,
immunohistochemistry may also be a valuable tool in the
detection of patients a risk [15]. The molecular phenotype
may provide a superior tool for survival prediction than
the TNM staging, given the heterogeneity of bladder
cancer biology and the need for therapy personalization
[53–56]. Since FOXM1 itself is praised to be a promising
drug target in many solid tumor entities [21, 34, 38],
translational studies are needed in order to implement
FOXM1 in the race for MIBC therapy personalization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population and specimen collection
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor
tissue samples were obtained from cystectomy of 84
muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma patients (pT24, N0/1), who were treated exclusively with radical
cystectomy in conjunction with bilateral lymphadenectomy
(only 14% received a platin based combination therapy)
at the University Medical Center Mannheim between
July 1998 and January 2006. All patients gave informed
consent. The retrospective analysis was approved by the
relevant institutional review board under number 2016814R-MA. The samples were evaluated for pathological
stage according to the 2002 TNM classification of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer. Histopathological

parameters of cases were assessed by a pathologist
specialized in uropathology (AH).
In order to validate our results in silico, we
studied array expression data of 61 MIBC patients
of the Chungbuck cohort (GSE13507). Tissue and
histopathologic staging were obtained by cystectomy
in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. MIBC patients
were treated with at least 4 cycles of cisplatin-based
chemotherapy as described before [57]. Patients
with squamous cell carcinoma were excluded as they
may distort clustering and deflect from the genuine
pathophysiology of muscle-invasive transitional cell
carcinoma. Grading of this cohort was assessed according
to WHO grading classification 2004.

between a high risk and a low risk group. Kaplan-Meier
estimates together with the log-rank test were used for
survival analysis. The level of significance was <0.05.
The primary endpoints were disease specific survival
(DSS) and overall survival (OS) defined as death for
any reason. Also progression-free survival (PFS) was
recorded as time interval between cystectomy with
lymphadenectomy and local or metastatic progression.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software
version 20 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Subclassification of MIBC patients and data
validation
For MIBC subclassification, subtype specific genes
from consensus data tested insilico for subtype enrichment
were collected [33, 35, 36]. For both cohorts, we used a
7-gene panel for MIUC subtyping consisting in a curated
luminal (KRT20, GATA3), basal (KRT5, KRT6A, CDH3)
and p53-like (SORBS1, CNN1) gene signature. Patients
were assigned to the different subtypes by the Ward
unsupervised hierarchical clustering method using the
JMP software version 12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
The subtype specific expression of FOXM1 and MKI67
was verified by the Kruskal-Wallis test.
The MIBC subclassification was performed by the
nCounter technology (Nanostring, Seattle, WA, USA) on
a subgroup of the Mannheim cohort [61]. An amount of
100ng total RNA was used as input after quality control
with qPCR and Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE, USA). Preprocessing was performed
by the nSolver Software 2.5 (Nanostring). The nCounter
assay was normalized using the geometric mean of 6
reference genes and 6 positive controls. Reference genes
were selected in order to cover low expression (G6PD,
TUBB) as well as high expression genes (B2M, CALM2,
GAPDH and RPL37A) with a Spearman correlation of at
least 0.40 and showed a mean probe normalization factor
of 1.3. Negative background substraction was performed
by 8 negative controls.
Validation of MIBC risk stratification and
subclassification was performed in silico on the Chungbuk
cohort (GSE13507) based on Illumina human-6 v2.0
beadchip data of 61 MIBC patients. Preprocessing of array
data was realized by the Illumina BeadStudio software
using quantile normalization and log2 transformation. Only
high grade tumors were selected for MIBC subclassification
given the heterogeneity of tumor grade in the Chungbuk
cohort. Indeed, it has been shown that molecular subclasses
vary strongly between tumor grade [62].

Expression analysis of FOXM1 and MKI67 in
the Mannheim cohort
RNA was extracted from 81 FFPE samples of
MIBC patients according to a fully automated, highthroughput extraction workflow which runs on an Xtract
XL liquid-handling robot (STRATIFYER Molecular
Pathology GmbH, Cologne, Germany). One-step
qRT-PCR was applied for the relative quantification
of FOXM1 and MKI67 mRNA by using TaqMan
quantitative RT-PCR. Calmodulin 2 (CALM2) was
used as reference gene [58–60]. Gene expression has
been assessed in duplicates by qRT-PCR using the
SuperScript III PLATINUM One-Step quantitative RTPCR System (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) on a
Stratagene Mx3005p (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen,
Germany). FOXM1 expression analysis was performed
with the following primers covering all isoforms (forward
5’-GACCACCTGGAGCCCTTTG-3’, reverse 5’-GATG
TTGGATAGGCTATTGTTGATAGTG-3’, Tamra probe
5’- AGAAACGGGAGACCTGTGCAGATG-3’). MKI67
expression analysis was performed with the following
primers (forward 5’-CGAGACGCCTGGTTACTATCAA-3’,
reverse 5’-GGATACGGATGTCACATTCAATACC-3’,
Tamra probe 5’-ACGGTCCCCACTTTCCCCTGAGC-3’).
Ct values were normalized by subtracting the Cq value of the
endogenous reference gene CALM2 from the Ct value of
the target genes (ΔCt) [60]. Expression results were then
reported as 40-ΔCq values which correlate proportionally
with the mRNA expression level of the target genes.

Statistical analysis
Clinico-demographic
characteristics
were
compared with Fishers exact test, the Mann-Whitney
U-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. A distinct FOXM1
cut-off for risk stratification by means of survival
prediction was determined by comparing iteratively
the HR for different cut-off levels with the Cox
proportional hazards model. The cut-off with highest
HR was considered as appropriate for discrimination
