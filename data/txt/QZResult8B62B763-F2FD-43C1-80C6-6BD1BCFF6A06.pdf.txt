Abstract
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are considered a paradigm of chemosensitive tumors. Embryonal
carcinoma cells represent the pluripotent entity of TGCTs and are characterized by expression of Oct-4, a key
regulator of pluripotency and a determinant of their inherent hypersensitivity to cisplatin. However, the
mechanisms underlying this Oct-4–mediated sensitivity are poorly understood. We previously showed that
p53 is a major player in cisplatin hypersensitivity and therefore investigated whether Oct-4 may directly affect
p53 activity. Despite a signiﬁcant decrease in sensitivity, depletion of Oct-4 neither did alter cisplatin-induced
transactivation of p53 target genes nor its subcellular localization. These data indicate that, rather than
directly modulating p53 activity, Oct-4 provides a cellular context that augments the proapoptotic activity of
p53. As mitochondrial priming by the Bcl-2 family is a known determinant of chemosensitivity, we compared
the constitutive levels of these proteins in Oct-4–positive and -depleted cells. We identiﬁed Noxa as the only
Bcl-2 family protein to be highly correlated with Oct-4 status and cisplatin sensitivity. Compared with
differentiated cells, constitutive Noxa levels were signiﬁcantly higher in Oct-4–positive cell lines and cancer
patient samples. Furthermore, RNA interference–mediated knockdown of Oct-4 resulted in reduced Noxa
transcript, in an almost complete loss of constitutive Noxa protein and decreased cisplatin hypersensitivity to
a similar extent as did Noxa depletion. In conclusion, our study indicates that Noxa is a central determinant
of hypersensitivity to cisplatin. Oct-4–dependent high constitutive levels of this BH3-only protein prime
embryonal carcinoma cells to undergo rapid and massive apoptosis in response to p53 activation. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most frequent
carcinomas in young male adults with a still increasing incidence worldwide. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy cures the
majority of patients even in advanced stages due to the
extraordinary sensitivity of TGCTs to cisplatin. Thus, TGCTs
are considered as the paradigm of a chemosensitive tumor (1).
Several mechanisms have been considered to underlie this
hypersensitivity, including the high apoptotic propensity of
TGCT cells (2, 3).

The transcription factor Oct-4, a key regulator of pluripotency,
is exclusively expressed in cells of nonmalignant pluripotent
nature, that is, embryonic stem cells (ESC) and germ cells, as well
as their malignant counterparts embryonal carcinoma and
seminoma, where it serves as a speciﬁc malignancy marker
(4, 5). Loss of Oct-4 causes a signiﬁcant reduction of cisplatin
hypersensitivity and was proposed to account for acquired
cisplatin resistance in refractory tumors (6, 7). We and others
have shown that cisplatin hypersensitivity is highly dependent
on a functional p53 protein (8–10). The central role of this tumor
suppressor was also shown by the ﬁnding that these cells are
sensitive not only to cisplatin but also to DNA damage–independent p53 activators such as Nutlin-3 (10–12). Together, these
results indicate that hypersensitivity to p53 activation requires
an Oct-4–mediated cellular context. We now report that the low
apoptotic threshold of Oct-4–positive TGCT cells is dictated by
the constitutive presence of high Noxa protein levels.

Oct-4–Dependent Constitutive Noxa Levels Determine Cisplatin Sensitivity

(embryonal carcinoma), and H12.1ODM (in vitro differentiated
derivative of H12.1). Origin and cultivation procedures of these
cell lines were described previously (6, 10). The cell lines 833K
(embryonal carcinoma), kindly provided by Prof. Andrews
(University of Shefﬁeld, Shefﬁeld, UK), and GCT-72 (differentiated state), kindly provided by Prof. Pera (University of
Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), were cultivated under
same conditions. The cell line H12.1RA (in vitro differentiated
derivative of H12.1) was established by treatment of H12.1 with
all-trans-retinoid acid during cultivation in GCT-72–conditioned medium followed by cultivation under same condition
as the other cell lines (6, 10).
H460 (lung) and A2780 (ovary) cells were obtained from the
NCI-60 cell line panel and cultivated in RPMI-1640 with 10 %
fetal calf serum and glutamine. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) and ﬁbroblasts were isolated and maintained as
described previously (13, 14).
Reagents
Cisplatin and Nutlin-3 (Sigma) were used at a concentration
of 10 mmol/L, etoposide was used at 5 mmol/L, and doxorubicin
at 100 ng/mL. MG132 was used at a concentration of 1 mmol/L.
Protein expression
Cells were lysed to obtain cellular protein according to
standard protocols. Western blotting was conducted using a
SDS-PAGE Gel Electrophoresis system.
mRNA expression
Total RNA was extracted and transcribed to cDNA according to standard protocols. Expression was analyzed using
BioMark HD System (Fluidigm) according to manufacturer's
instructions. TaqMan assays were obtained from Applied
Biosystems (Supplementary Table S1). The relative amount of
Noxa mRNA and pre-mRNA was determined by a SYBR Greenbased qPCR assay (7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System,
Applied Biosystems). Contamination of RNA samples with
gDNA was excluded by DNase digestion followed by reverse
transcription to cDNA. A primer pair spanning an exon-exon
junction was designed to detect Noxa mRNA levels, whereas
Noxa pre-mRNA was detected using primers that span an
exon–intron junction (for primer sequences see Supplementary Table S2). Primers for detection of actin expression for
normalization were kindly provided by Claudia Kalla (Institute
of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany).
Sulforhodamine B microculture colorimetric assay
IC50 of cisplatin and Nutlin-3 were determined as described
(15).
Subcellular fractionation
Cytoplasm and nuclei were separated using Mitochondria
Isolation Kit for cultured cells (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was assessed by ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated Annexin-V staining (16).

siRNA Experiments
To silence Oct-4, Noxa, Puma, and p53, we used siGenome
SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon, for sequences see Supplementary Table S3). Bim was silenced using Bim siRNA from
Santa Cruz. As a control, we used siGenome Non-Targeting
siRNA #1 (Dharmacon). Cells were transfected using
DharmaFECT#3 (Dharmacon). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated according to requirements. To
evaluate the efﬁcacy of siRNA silencing, protein lysates were
prepared and analyzed by Western Blotting.
Tissue samples
Tissue samples from patients with TGCTs were provided by
the Department of Urology, Eberhard Karls University of
Tuebingen (Tuebingen, Germany). The local ethics committee
approved the collection of patient samples (315/2012BO2 and
396/2005V), and informed consent was obtained from the
patients. Specimen were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
after surgery and stored at 80 C for further use. To obtain
protein lysates for Western blotting, tissue was lysed using
FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals) and sonication.
Statistics
Data are expressed as SD of the mean. Correlations are
expressed as Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient.

Results
Oct-4 depletion does not compromise the p53 response
to cisplatin
It has previously been shown that Oct-4 protein levels are
highly correlated with cisplatin hypersensitivity in TGCT cells
(6). Therefore, we ﬁrst tested whether Oct-4 is also required for
the more general sensitivity of TGCTs to DNA damage–independent p53 activators (10). This was addressed by assessing
the impact of Nutlin-3 on NTERA-2D1 cells subjected to RNA
interference (RNAi)-mediated Oct-4 knockdown. As shown
in Fig. 1A, Oct-4 depletion reduced Nutlin-3–induced apoptosis
to a degree comparable to that observed in cells treated with
cisplatin. These results suggest that efﬁcient induction of
apoptosis by p53 requires the pluripotent, Oct-4–positive
context of embryonal carcinoma cells.
Consequently, we investigated possible differences in the
accumulation and activation of p53 upon cisplatin in the
presence or absence of Oct-4. In response to cellular stress,
p53 activation leads to induction of a wide variety of target
genes. Hence, we screened a panel of 46 bona ﬁde p53
transcriptional targets (refs. 17, 18; Supplementary Table
S1) by quantitative PCR in Oct-4–positive and -deprived
NTERA-2D1 cells exposed to cisplatin. A similar analysis
was also conducted with the embryonal carcinoma cell line
2102EP that retains a nullipotent phenotype, allowing us to
discriminate between differentiation-dependent and direct
effects of Oct-4. Surprisingly, despite its pronounced impact
on apoptosis, Oct-4 depletion did not compromise the p53dependent transcriptional response to cisplatin in both cell
lines (Fig. 1B). Hence, induction of a p53-mediated transcriptional program is not the primary determinant of Oct4–mediated hypersensitivity.

Cells were incubated with or without cisplatin for 6 hours. To evaluate p53 transactivation activity upon cisplatin treatment in dependency of Oct-4, transcripts
of 46 bona ﬁde p53 target genes were quantiﬁed by qPCR. For this, RNA was isolated, transcribed to cDNA, and applied to qPCR analysis using
the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Graph shows means of fold changes upon cisplatin of detected transcripts from 3 independent experiments;
dots depict fold change values of each transcript in cells pretreated with control (x-axis) or Oct-4 siRNA (y-axis). C, Oct-4 depletion does not affect
p53 accumulation and localization. Cells were treated with cisplatin for indicated times and subjected to subcellular fractionation. p53 protein was
analyzed by Western blotting along with tubulin, representing the cytoplasmic compartment and TBP representing the nuclear compartment. Graphs reﬂect
densitometric quantiﬁcation of p53 protein levels normalized to tubulin or TBP, respectively.

Beyond its function as a transcription factor, p53 is capable
of facilitating apoptosis in the cytoplasm. Thus, we monitored
the accumulation of p53 upon cisplatin exposure in both
nucleus and cytoplasm. Notably, upon cisplatin treatment,
p53 accumulated to a similar extent in both compartments
(Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, neither p53 accumulation nor its
localization was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by knockdown of
Oct-4 (Fig. 1C), which further argues against a direct inﬂuence
of Oct-4 on p53 activity. Together, these results indicate that
rather than directly altering p53 activity, Oct-4 provides an
apoptosis-prone cellular context that augments the proapoptotic efﬁcacy of p53.
Oct-4 determines cisplatin sensitivity by modulating the
Bcl-2 family composition
Recently, it was shown that the response to cytotoxic
chemotherapy is dependent on the relative composition
of Bcl-2 family proteins, which determines the apoptotic
threshold (19). We therefore investigated a possible correlation of individual Bcl-2 family proteins with Oct-4 and
cisplatin sensitivity in NTERA-2D1 and 2102EP cells. To that
end, we silenced Oct-4 by RNAi-mediated knockdown and
examined the protein levels of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family

members Bax, Bak, Noxa, Puma, Bim, and Bid, as well as the
antiapoptotic members Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1.
Notably, Noxa was the only Bcl-2 family protein that could
be detected selectively in the presence of Oct-4 (Fig. 2A). The
fact that this was observed in both pluripotent NTERA-2D1
and nullipotent 2102EP cells (Fig. 2A) suggests that the
reduction of Noxa protein is not just a secondary effect of
differentiation but a direct consequence of Oct-4 depletion.
Mcl-1, the major antiapoptotic binding partner of Noxa, was
also reduced upon Oct-4 knockdown (Fig. 2A). As Noxa levels
became practically undetectable under such conditions (Fig.
2A), the Noxa/Mcl-1 ratio was shifted considerably in favor
of Mcl-1, probably establishing a higher apoptotic threshold.
Knockdown of Oct-4 also reduced the levels of the BH3-only
proteins Puma and Bim, especially in 2102EP cells, although
not as strongly as observed for Noxa (Fig. 2A). Notably, a role
of Puma in hypersensitivity of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells was previously proposed (10). The protein
levels of all other Bcl-2 family members analyzed did not
exhibit concomitant changes in these cell lines upon Oct-4
depletion (Fig. 2A).
Next, we investigated the impact of the Oct-4–dependent
Bcl-2 family proteins Noxa, Puma, and Bim on cisplatin

Oct-4–Dependent Constitutive Noxa Levels Determine Cisplatin Sensitivity

and incubated for 48 hours. Controls reﬂect cells treated with a nontargeting siRNA. A, Noxa, Puma, and Bim expression is dependent on Oct-4.
Transfected cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis to determine protein levels of Bcl-2 family members. B, silencing of Noxa and Puma but

hypersensitivity. Therefore, we transfected NTERA-2D1 and
2102EP cells with the corresponding siRNAs and obtained a
similar knockdown efﬁciency for each siRNA (Fig. 2B, right).
Silencing of Noxa led to a marked decrease in sensitivity to
cisplatin in both cell lines, comparable with that observed upon
Oct-4 knockdown (Fig. 2B, left). A similar trend was also seen
with Puma, although in NTERA-2D1 cells, silencing of Puma
did not reduce apoptosis as efﬁciently as did Noxa knockdown.
In contrast, Bim knockdown had only minor effects on cisplatin hypersensitivity (Fig. 2B, left). To investigate possible
cross-regulation between these proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, NTERA-2D1 cells were depleted of each protein and
levels of the respective others were quantiﬁed. We found no
signiﬁcant cross-regulation between Noxa, Puma, and Bim
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
It is of note that knockdown of either Oct-4 or Noxa reduced
sensitivity of TGCTs not only to cisplatin but also to other
genotoxic agents such as etoposide and doxorubicin as well as
to the DNA damage–independent p53 activator Nutlin-3 (Sup-

are central mediators of the general hypersensitivity of TGCTs.
Constitutive Noxa protein levels are closely correlated
with Oct-4 and cisplatin hypersensitivity in a panel of
TGCT cell lines and patient samples
Noxa and Puma are induced in response to several cellular
stress stimuli. However, Noxa protein was also found to be
highly expressed in unstressed, undifferentiated embryonal
carcinoma cells but not in cell lines derived from other tumor
entities (10). We therefore investigated whether constitutive
Noxa and Puma levels are maintained via transcriptional
mechanisms in embryonal carcinoma cells. In contrast to
Puma, Noxa transcript was expressed signiﬁcantly higher in
Oct-4–positive NTERA-2D1 and 2102EP cells than in Oct-4–
negative lymphocytes, ﬁbroblasts, or cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A,
left). A direct effect of Oct-4 on Noxa mRNA expression was
conﬁrmed by Oct-4 knockdown experiments. Oct-4 depletion
reduced Noxa transcript in NTERA-2D1 and 2102EP cells to a

Oct-4–Dependent Constitutive Noxa Levels Determine Cisplatin Sensitivity

regulates Noxa gene transcription. Puma, on the other hand,
was only slightly reduced upon Oct-4 depletion (Fig. 3A, left).
Together, these data suggest an Oct-4–dependent transcriptional mechanism resulting in high constitutive Noxa protein
levels.
The effect of Oct-4 on constitutive expression of Noxa in Oct4–positive and -depleted embryonal carcinoma cells was even
more pronounced at the protein level (Fig. 3A, right). Furthermore, the absolute levels of Noxa protein in Oct-4–positive cells
were 9.2-fold (NTERA-2D1 vs. PBMCs) and 11.2-fold (2102EP
vs. PBMC) higher as those of stimulated hematopoietic cells
(Fig. 3A, right), which have been shown to exhibit constitutive
Noxa protein (20), whereas the difference in transcript levels
was only 2.3-fold (NTERA-2D1 vs. PBMC) and 1.3-fold (2102EP
vs. PBMCs; Fig. 3A, left). It is therefore likely that Oct-4 also
modulates Noxa protein translation and/or stability by a yet
unknown mechanism. In contrast to Noxa, Puma levels were
found to be higher only in 1 of the 2 Oct-4–positive cell lines
than in differentiated cells (Fig. 3A, right).
To further investigate the correlation of Oct-4 and cisplatin
sensitivity with Noxa and Puma, we analyzed constitutive
protein levels of both BH3-only proteins (Fig. 3B, top left)
together with cisplatin IC50 values (Fig. 3B, bottom left) in an
extended TGCT cell line panel consisting of 5 Oct-4–negative
and 5 Oct-4–positive cell lines. We conﬁrmed a correlation of
cisplatin sensitivity with Oct-4 (Spearman r ¼ 0.842, P ¼
0.004; Fig. 3B, bottom right). Importantly, Noxa was signiﬁcantly correlated with Oct-4 expression (Spearman r ¼ 0.891,
P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3B, top right) as well as with cisplatin sensitivity
(Spearman r ¼ 0.806, P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 3B, bottom right). On the
other hand, while Puma protein levels were also positively
correlated with Oct-4 status, this correlation was weaker than
for Noxa (Spearman r ¼ 0.685, P ¼ 0.035; Fig. 3B, top right), and
no signiﬁcant correlation was seen with cisplatin sensitivity
(Spearman r ¼ 0.527, P > 0.05; Fig. 3B, bottom right). Notably,
similar results were observed with Nutlin-3 (Supplementary
Fig. S4). These data further support the conjecture that Oct-4
lowers the apoptotic threshold in TGCTs primarily by maintaining high constitutive Noxa protein levels.
In addition, we sought to extend our in vitro ﬁndings to
cancer patient samples. Indeed, we could conﬁrm a close
correlation between Oct-4 and Noxa protein levels in primary
tissue samples derived from 5 embryonal carcinomas and 8
seminomas (Spearman r ¼ 0.832, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3C).
Accumulation of both Noxa and p53 is required to induce
cell death in Oct-4–depleted TGCT cells
We have previously shown that accumulation of p53 is a
central determinant in TGCT hypersensitivity (10). In the
present study, we established that Oct-4–positive TGCT cells
are characterized by high constitutive Noxa protein levels,
which seems to be a requirement for their p53-mediated
hypersensitivity. Therefore, in Oct-4–depleted cells, pharmacologic induction of both Noxa and p53 protein should result in
cell death. To test this hypothesis, NTERA-2D1 and 2102EP
cells, respectively, were depleted of Oct-4 by RNAi-mediated
gene silencing (Fig. 4, top). In contrast to cisplatin or Nutlin-3
(Fig. 1A), treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132

www.aacrjournals.org

resulted in efﬁcient induction of apoptosis in both Oct-4–
depleted cell lines (Fig. 4, bottom). Importantly, MG132 treatment induced simultaneous accumulation of Noxa and p53
protein (Fig. 4, middle). Prevention of accumulation of either
protein by RNAi-mediated knockdown led to increased survival upon MG132 treatment in NTERA-2D1 and 2102EP cells
(Fig. 4, bottom). These data further show that both Noxa and
p53 protein are required to induce apoptosis in TGCT cells.

Discussion
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been a successful cure
for TGCT for decades. A variety of molecular determinants of
these neoplasms were proposed to account for their exquisite
sensitivity to cisplatin such as a reduced DNA repair capacity, a
deregulated G1–S transition or marginal p21 expression (2,
3, 21). Much of the research done in this ﬁeld has focused on
p53, which is almost exclusively expressed in its wild-type
conformation in TGCTs (22). We recently showed a central role
for p53 in TGCT hypersensitivity to cisplatin and suggested an
intrinsic sensitivity of these tumors to activation of p53, which
leads to robust induction of apoptosis in this speciﬁc cellular
context (10). In the present study, we found that this sensitivity
is dependent on the presence of Oct-4, although p53 activation
is not directly inﬂuenced by this mediator of pluripotency.
Rather, by maintaining high constitutive Noxa protein levels,
Oct-4 provides a cellular context that primes TGCT cells to
p53-dependent apoptosis.
TGCTs derive from intrinsically apoptosis-prone tissue.
Therefore, their unique responsiveness to chemotherapy might
be due to inherent biological characteristics (23). An intrinsic
molecular determinant of the pluripotent compartment of
TGCTs is the expression of regulators of pluripotency such
as Oct-4. Recent work related loss of Oct-4 to an increase in
cisplatin resistance (6). In the present study, we show that Oct4 depletion not only protected cells from cisplatin-induced cell
death but also led to a reduction of the apoptotic response to
other genotoxic and non-genotoxic p53 inducers (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S2). These data imply that Oct-4 mediates
the general intrinsic hypersensitivity to p53 activators in
pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells. Several studies have
attributed the increased susceptibility to apoptosis to overexpression of p53 (24, 25). However, we and others could show
that high p53 protein levels are not a characteristic of TGCTs
(10, 26). Here, we show that Oct-4 had no impact on constitutive p53 levels or on its accumulation upon cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, Oct-4 depletion did not inﬂuence
the cisplatin-induced transactivation of 46 representative
bona ﬁde p53 target genes (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that
the transcriptional p53 response is not substantially altered in
Oct-4–positive hypersensitive TGCT cells. In addition to its
capability to launch the apoptotic program through transactivation of proapoptotic target genes, p53 can directly induce
apoptosis in the cytoplasm by interacting with Bcl-2 family
proteins. Subcellular fractionation revealed that besides an
accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, cisplatin treatment
resulted in a similar accumulation in the cytoplasm (Fig.
1C), suggesting that p53 could function independently of its
transcriptional activity to launch the apoptotic program in

TGCTs; this was also proposed as a proapoptotic mechanism
in ESCs (27). However, Oct-4 depletion did not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence subcellular distribution of p53 (Fig. 1C). Together,
these data show that neither transcriptional nor cytoplasmic
functions of p53 are dependent on the presence of Oct-4 in
TGCT cells. As Oct-4 is central for cisplatin sensitivity, it must
provide a cellular context allowing an effective proapoptotic
p53 response.
Recently, Letai and colleagues established a model to explain
and predict chemotherapeutic response by mitochondrial
priming (19). According to this hypothesis, occupation of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins by their proapoptotic
counterparts determines the proximity of a cell to the threshold of apoptosis (28). Our data show that the presence of Oct-4
in pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells dictates a Bcl-2
family proﬁle dominated by high constitutive Noxa protein
levels, which augments the cell's commitment to apoptosis. We
found that Noxa protein levels are tightly correlated with both
Oct-4 status and cisplatin sensitivity in a panel of cell lines and
also in samples from primary TGCTs.
The relative levels of other Bcl-2 proteins have also previously been proposed to determine hypersensitivity in TGCTs.
Several studies suggested that the enhanced sensitivity to
genotoxic agents is dependent on a high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio

(29) and low levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (30, 31). A chemoprotective role of Bcl-xL in these tumors has also been proposed
(32). However, we found no correlation between the protein
levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bak and Oct-4 status (Fig. 2A). Indeed,
recent data showed that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, or Bak levels were
similar among TGCT cell lines with differential cisplatin
sensitivity (15, 33). Together, these data indicate that Noxa is
the only Bcl-2 family protein that is tightly correlated to both
Oct-4 status and cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that constitutive Noxa protein is a key determinant of the exclusive
sensitivity of Oct-4–positive embryonal carcinoma cells to
cisplatin. Moreover, we show that the general sensitivity of
TGCTs to genotoxic and non-genotoxic agents is also dependent on Noxa (Supplementary Fig. S2). The prominent role of
Noxa for TGCT hypersensitivity is further supported by the
ﬁnding that Noxa protein was found to be correlated with good
clinical prognosis in patients with embryonal carcinoma (34).
Noxa was shown to preferentially bind to Mcl-1 and A1 (35).
The apoptotic potential of this BH3-only protein when overexpressed was therefore suggested to be quite variable due to its
inability to antagonize Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (36). However, as
mentioned above, TGCTs exhibit low expression of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL (30, 31), potentially providing an ideal premise for an
increased apoptotic potential of Noxa overexpression.

Oct-4–Dependent Constitutive Noxa Levels Determine Cisplatin Sensitivity

Moreover, our results show a considerable shift of the Noxa/Mcl1 ratio in favor of Mcl-1 upon Oct-4 depletion (Fig. 2A), enforcing
a higher apoptotic threshold. A similar dependence on the Noxa/
Mcl-1 balance was shown for HeLa and pancreatic cancer cells
treated with camptothecin (37, 38). It is of note that Noxa was
recently shown to be capable of binding Bcl-xL upon DNA
damage and thus facilitate apoptosis induction (39), a conceivable mechanism that broadens the proapoptotic capacity of
Noxa. In addition, it seems most likely that while Noxa inhibits
the antiapoptotic functions of Mcl-1, a robust induction of other
BH3-only proteins by p53 sequesters Bcl-xL and activates Bax
and Bak. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Puma was
found to be as important as was Noxa for the hypersensitivity to
cisplatin (Fig. 2B). However, constitutive Puma protein levels
could not to be linked to cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 3B). These
results indicate that Puma exerts its prominent proapoptotic
function in TGCT cells only upon induction by p53 as previously
described for other cell types (40).
Because of the established function of Oct-4 as a transcription factor, it is tempting to speculate that transcription of the
Noxa gene is directly promoted by Oct-4. Interestingly, in a
recent study, an Oct-4–binding site was mapped within 8 kb of
the Noxa promoter (41). Moreover, Noxa mRNA was shown to
be upregulated in ESCs (42) and its expression was found to be
correlated with Oct-4 in this cell type (43, 44). The ﬁnding that
Noxa pre-mRNA was downregulated upon Oct-4 depletion to a
similar extent as the corresponding mature mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3) suggests that Oct-4 may indeed directly
regulate the transcription of the Noxa gene. However, as
Oct-4 is involved in the transactivation of many genes, including other transcription factors (44), it remains possible that
this regulation might as well include indirect effects.
Noxa was commonly seen as a transcriptionally activated
stress-responsive gene (36) rather than a protein present at
high levels in unstressed cells. However, upregulated Noxa
protein levels were reported to restrain lymphocyte expansion
and can be triggered by glucose deprivation (20). Together with
the high constitutive protein levels reported in the present
work (Fig. 3A), these data suggest an additional regulation at
the protein level, for example, through the ubiquitin–proteasome system (45, 46). As Noxa protein regulation by Oct-4 was
shown to be more pronounced than regulation at the mRNA
level (Fig. 3A), altered Noxa protein stability cannot be excluded as a possible additional explanation for high constitutive
Noxa protein levels.
We established that loss of high constitutive Noxa protein
levels in Oct-4–depleted cells causes resistance to cisplatin and
Nutlin-3. However, these cells were still sensitive to proteasomal inhibition by MG132 (Fig. 4). Importantly, MG132 resulted
in stabilization of Noxa protein reaching levels comparable to
that observed in Oct-4–positive cells. Concomitantly, p53 was

stabilized upon proteasomal inhibition. RNAi-mediated
knockdown of Noxa or p53, respectively, rescued Oct-4–depleted cells from cell death upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 4). These
data further indicate that hypersensitivity of TGCTs is dependent on both high levels of Noxa and induction of p53.
We propose that, under basal nonstressed conditions,
embryonal carcinoma cells may buffer the high apoptotic
pressure driven by high constitutive Noxa levels by a parallel
increase in its antiapoptotic binding partner Mcl-1. Upon
cellular stress, p53-mediated induction of additional BH3-only
proteins such as PUMA (10) and concomitant Mcl-1 degradation (47) may then shift the balance and lead to a rapid and
robust induction of apoptosis.
In conclusion, our present study shows that Oct-4–dependent high constitutive Noxa levels determine cisplatin
hypersensitivity in TGCTs. Despite the predominant role of
p53 in TGCT hypersensitivity, Oct-4 does not directly inﬂuence p53 activation but rather provides an extremely low
apoptotic threshold by maintaining high constitutive Noxa
protein levels. Therefore, in response to cellular stress,
accumulation of p53 triggers a rapid and massive induction
of apoptosis.
