ABSTRACT
We previously showed that macrophages (MΦs) infiltrate the bone marrow (BM)
of patients with myeloma and may play a role in drug resistance. This study analyzed
chemokines expressed by myeloma BM that are responsible for recruiting monocytes
to the tumor bed. We found that chemokines CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2 were highly
expressed by myeloma and BM cells, and the levels of CCL14 and CCL3 in myeloma
BM positively correlated with the percentage of BM-infiltrating MΦs. In vitro, these
chemokines were responsible for chemoattracting human monocytes to tumor sites
and in vivo for MΦ infiltration into myeloma-bearing BM in the 5TGM1 mouse model.
Surprisingly, we also found that these chemokines stimulated MΦ in vitro proliferation
induced by myeloma cells and in vivo in a human myeloma xenograft SCID mouse
model. The chemokines also activated normal MΦ polarization and differentiation
into myeloma-associated MΦs. Western blot analysis revealed that these chemokines
promoted growth and survival signaling in MΦs via activating the PI3K/Akt and ERK
MAPK pathways and c-myc expression. Thus, this study provides novel insight into
the mechanism of MΦ infiltration of BM and also potential targets for improving the
efficacy of chemotherapy in myeloma.

INTRODUCTION

drug resistance within the BM microenvironment [2].
Our previous research has suggested that macrophages
(MΦs) are an important component in the MM-BM
microenvironment. MΦ infiltration is increased in MM
BM, and these MM-associated MΦs (mMΦs) induce MM
drug resistance in vitro and in vivo in MM mouse models
[3, 4]. Suyani et al have shown that MM patients with high
BM MΦ infiltration have poor prognosis [5]. All these
findings suggest that mMΦ may be a risk factor in MM
management.
Findings from tumor-associated MΦs (TAMs) in
human solid cancers suggest that most TAMs originate

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by
accumulation of monoclonal malignant plasma cells in the
bone marrow (BM). In the United States, about 22,000
patients are newly diagnosed yearly, and MM accounts
for 20% of deaths in all hematological malignancies
[1]. MM management has improved in the past decades,
mostly due to the use of new drugs in clinic. However,
MM remains an incurable disease, and the current
survival is approximately 6-8 years [2]. One major
problem in MM management is that MM cells develop

from circulating monocytes (MOs) [6, 7]. Cells in the
tumor microenvironment, including both tumor cells and
stromal cells, overexpressed chemokines such as CCL2
(MCP-1), CXCL12 (SDF-1), CCL9 (MIP-1γ) and/or
CCL18 (PARC), and recruit MOs into the tumor bed.
Recruited MOs differentiate into TAMs in the presence
of MΦ differentiation factors such as CSF-1, GM-CSF,
and Flt3-ligand [6, 8]. Interestingly, the MΦ differentiation
factor CSF-1 may also regulate MO chemotaxis to the
tumor bed, suggesting crosstalk between MO recruitment
and TAM differentiation [9]. In addition to MO
chemotaxis into the tumor bed, resident TAM division
also contributes to the increased numbers of TAMs in
tumor sites [10]. However, the mechanisms underlying
the increased numbers of MΦs and polarization of normal
MΦs to mMΦs in MM BM are unclear. In this study
we analyzed the chemokines expressed in the MM BM

microenvironment and their roles in recruiting MOs to the
MM tumor bed and conditioning them to become mMΦs.

RESULTS
Human myeloma bone marrow overexpresses
chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL14
To identify chemokines that regulate MO/MΦ
chemoattraction to the MM tumor bed, we examined
expression of different MO chemokines in MM BM
cells (total cells from MM BM aspirates) by qPCR [11].
As shown in Figure 1A, expression of CCL2, 3, 4, 5, 7,
8, 13, and 14 varied in MM BM. Among them, CCL2,
3, 4, 5, and 14 had relatively high expression. Next,

we hypothesized that only the chemokines that were
overexpressed in MM BM, but not in healthy BM, might
contribute to the increased MΦ accumulation in MM
tumor bed. Thus, we compared the chemokine expression
profiles in MM BM vs. healthy BM plasma by ELISA.
CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL14 (HCC1), and CCL2 (MCP-1)
were highly expressed in BM plasma from MM patients,
but not in BM from healthy donors (Figure 1B; p < 0.05).
The expression of CCL5 (RANTES) or CCL4 (MIP-1β)
was no different between the patient and healthy donor
samples (p > 0.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis of
human BM biopsies also confirmed that MM BM highly
expressed CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2 proteins (Figure 1C).
Finally, we analyzed the association between

chemokine expression in BM plasma and the number
of BM MΦs in MM patients. BM plasma chemokine
expression was determined by ELISA, and the number of
MΦs was measured by flow cytometry for CD14+/CD68+
cells as previously described [4]. As shown in Figure 1D,
linear regression revealed that MM patients with high
CCL14 and CCL3 levels in BM also had a high percentage
of BM MΦs (p < 0.01). No positive correlation was found
between CCL2 expression and the percentage of BM MΦs
(p > 0.05). Overall, our results suggested that chemokines
CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2 were highly expressed in MM
BM compared with normal BM, and CCL3 and CCL14
expression levels positively correlated with the numbers
of BM MΦs in MM patients.

Human myeloma cells upregulate the expression
of chemokines by bone marrow stromal cells

to p < 0.01). Overall, our results suggested that both MM
cells and BMSCs, especially MM-associated BMSCs,
contributed to secretion of high levels of CCL3, CCL14
and CCL2 chemokines in the MM BM microenvironment.

As the MM BM microenvironment consists of
both (CD138+) malignant plasma cells and (CD138-)
non-malignant cells, we examined the sources of cells
that produce the identified chemokines CCL3, CCL14
and CCL2. RT-PCR analysis of MM patient samples
showed that both CD138+ and CD138- cells in MM BM
expressed CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2 and that, for the
most part, expression was higher in CD138- cells than
CD138+ primary MM cells (Figure 2A). MM cell lines
also expressed (data not shown) and secreted these
chemokines (Figure 2B). On the other hand, in MM cell
(ARP-1 and MM.1S)-conditioned bone marrow stromal
cells (BMSCs), expression of these chemokines was
upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels compared
with unconditioned BMSCs (Figure 2C and 2D, p < 0.05

CCL3, CCL14 and CCL2 activate monocyte
migration to the MM tumor bed in vitro
Flow cytometry analysis showed that MOs
expressed CCL3 receptors CCR1 and CCR5; CCL2
receptor CCR2, and CCL14 receptors CCR1 and CCR5
(Figure 3A). Next we examined the role of CCL3, CCL14,
and CCL2 in MO chemoattraction using an in vitro cell
migration assay. As shown in Figure 3B, MM cell lines
(ARP-1 and MM.1S) were cocultured with human BMSC
or total primary MM BM cells were cultured alone in
the lower chamber to simulate the MM tumor bed. MOs

cells were labeled with CFSE green fluorescent dye and
added in the upper transwell chamber. After coculture
for 24 hours, MOs migrating to the lower chamber were
identified by fluorescence microscopy and quantified.
MM and BMSC coculture and total BM cells from MM
patients stimulated greater MO migration than medium
control (Figure 3C), indicating that MM BMSC together
could chemoattract MOs to tumor sites. Addition of
CCL3, CCL14, or CCL2 neutralizing antibodies (a final
concentration of 10 μg/ml for each antibody) inhibited
MO migration (Figure 3D-3F, p < 0.05). Thus, our data
indicated that MOs were attracted to the MM tumor bed by
chemokines CCL3, CCL14 or CCL2 because the process
was significantly attenuated by antibodies directed against
these chemokines.

To study the role of the identified chemokines in
MO and MΦ recruitment in vivo, we used the murine
5TGM1 MM model established in C57BL/KawRij mice
[12]. Because the mouse does not have CCL14 homology
and human CCL14 cDNA shares the highest similarity
with human and mouse CCL3 (data not shown), we first
examined in vitro murine MΦ chemotaxis in the presence
of neutralizing antibodies to murine CCL3 or CCL2.
5TGM1 cells were cocultured with mouse BMSCs,
generated from C57BL/KawRij mouse hind leg BM, in

the lower transwell chamber, and mouse peritoneal MΦs
were added in the upper chamber. As shown in Figure 4A,
CCL3 or CCL2 neutralizing antibodies attenuated murine
MΦ chemotactic migration in vitro (p < 0.05), confirming
the role of these murine chemokines in MΦ chemotactic
migration. Next, we intravenously inoculated 5TGM1
cells into the mice and treated them with either control
IgG or neutralizing antibodies against CCL3 or CCL2
(100 µg per mouse each time, intraperitoneally injected
1 day before and 7 days after tumor cell inoculation;
Figure 4B). Tumor development was monitored every 7
days by in vivo bioluminescent assay and by measuring
circulating mouse IgG2b that was secreted by 5TGM1
cells (data not shown). Mice treated with control IgG or

neutralizing antibodies showed similar tumor burdens
(Figure 4C), probably because MOs/MΦs promote
MM chemoresistance without affecting tumor growth,
particularly at an early stage of disease. However, when
we compared the expression of the chemokine genes in
MM BM (5TGM1 tumor-bearing mice) versus tumorfree BM, we found that CCL3 and CCL2 expression was
higher in MM BM (Figure 4D, p < 0.01).
Immunohistochemistry staining for F4/80, a murine
MΦ marker, in mouse BM showed that MM BM had
a greater percentage of BM MΦs, similar to what we
observed in human MM BM [3], and injection of CCL3
or CCL2 neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced
the percentage of MΦs in murine MM BM (Figure 4E).

This finding was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis
of mouse BM cells to quantify the numbers of CD14+ and
F4/80+ MΦs (Figure 4F, p < 0.05). Taken together, these
in vivo findings strongly suggested that chemokines CCL3
and CCL2 were responsible for attracting MOs to infiltrate
MM BM microenvironment in vivo.

MO and MΦ proliferation in the MM tumor bed. First, we
examined MM-conditioned mMΦ proliferation in vitro.
MOs were prestained with the fluorescent dye CFSE to
identify nMΦs. nMΦs were further transwell-cocultured
with MM cells (ARP-1 cells) to obtain mMΦs. Diluted
CFSE signals were observed in mMΦs but not in nMΦs
cultured alone (Figure 5A), indicating that MM cells
stimulated nMΦs to proliferate. In a different experiment,
established nMΦ and mMΦ were cultured in medium for
2 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTS assay.
mMΦs but not nMΦs proliferated in 2-day culture (Figure
5B; p < 0.05). Finally, we examined whether human MOs/
MΦs could proliferate in vivo in a human MM xenograft
mouse model created as we have described previously [4].

Human myeloma cells enhance monocyte/
macrophage proliferation in vitro and in vivo
Previous studies showed that MΦ in situ
proliferation also contributes to increased numbers of
tissue MΦs and TAMs [10]. Therefore, we investigated

were generated as described in the Methods. The cells were then cultured in vitro in the presence of each of the chemokine neutralizing

was used as control. Cell proliferation at different time points was examined by MTS. B. nMΦs were cultured for 3 days in the presence of

MM tumor cells (ARP-1) were subcutaneously inoculated
into SCID mice together with CFSE-labeled MOs
obtained from healthy donors (Figure 5C). After tumor
development, the human MOs polarized into mMΦs.
Cells in the tumor bed were assessed by flow cytometry
analysis for CD14+/CFSE+ expression. As shown in Figure
5D, human mMΦs in the tumor bed exhibited a diluted
CFSE signal, indicating cell division occurring in vivo.
Overall, our results suggested that MM cells enhanced
MΦ proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

As an abnormally differentiated cell type induced by
both intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, TAMs have tumorpromoting phenotype as they activate tumor angiogenesis,
cancer cell proliferation, immune-suppression [14], cancel
cell survival, and metastasis [6]. The abundance of TAMs
usually indicates poor prognosis in various human cancers
[6]. The origin of TAMs has been widely investigated
in different human cancers. Although the prevailing
hypothesis regarding tissue MΦ origination has been
questioned recently, it is still widely accepted that TAMs
originate from circulating MOs via chemoattraction into
the tumor bed by chemokines that are secreted by tumor
cells and/or tumor stroma [10, 15]. To investigate which
chemokines regulate MO/MΦ infiltration in MM BM, we
examined expression of different chemokines in MM BM
aspirates. Three chemokines that attract MOs and MΦs,
CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2, were overexpressed in MM
BM as compared with normal BM, most likely secreted by
both MM cells and MM BMSCs. Importantly, we found
that CCL3 and CCL14 levels in MM patient BM plasma
positively correlated with the number of patient BM MΦs.
In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that CCL3, CCL14
and CCL2 could promote MO chemotactic migration into
MM BM.
Among those identified chemokines, CCL2
has long been recognized as a regulator of TAMs in
different human cancers [16], such as breast cancer
[17] and colon cancer [18]. In general, tumor cells and
stroma overexpress CCL2, which results in increased
MO recruitment and TAM generation. Also, Sinya and
colleagues showed that CCL2 deficiency decreased
adipose tissue MΦ proliferation in vivo, and the in situ
proliferation of resident MΦs driven by CCL2 is a crucial
process for MΦ accumulation in adipose tissue in obesity
[19]. Furthermore, Elena and colleagues showed that
blocking CCL2 led to M1 polarization-associated gene
and cytokine upregulation and diminished expression of
M2-associated markers in human MΦs. In CCL2 receptor
CCR2-deficient mice, BM-derived MΦs were reported to
display an M1-like polarization profile at the transcription
level. This CCL2-CCR2 axis shaped MΦ polarization
[20]. The C-myc oncogene is a key player in alternative
MΦ activation [21]. Interestingly, we found that CCL2
induced c-myc expression in MΦs. CCL3 has also been
reported for MO/MΦ chemoattaction in hepatocarcinoma
[22] and pancreatic carcinoma [23]. Different chemokines
may play redundant roles within the same tumor setting.
For example, both the MO chemokines CCL2 and CCL5
are overexpressed in breast cancer [24]. In MM, CCL3
and CCL2 have been found to regulate osteoclastmediated bone resorption. CCL3 and CCL2 bind to
their receptors expressed on osteoclast precursors and
promote osteoclast formation [25, 26]. CCL3 and CCL2
overexpression in MM has also been reported previously
[27, 28]. Unlike CCL3 or CCL2, CCL14 function in MM
has not been reported. CCL14 is unique in primates and

and

Next we examined the crosstalk between the
chemokine-mediated MO/MΦ chemoattraction and
mMΦ proliferation. Surprisingly, our results suggested
that the chemokines CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2 were also
involved in regulating mMΦ proliferation. MΦs were
obtained from healthy blood donors and used as nMΦs,
or cocultured in transwells with MM cells for 3 days to
generate mMΦs. As shown in Figure 6A, mMΦs but not
nMΦs proliferated, which could be inhibited by CCL3,
CCL14, or CCL2 neutralizing antibodies, added alone or
in a combination at the time of coculture (p < 0.05). On
the other hand, addition of CCL3, CCL14, or CCL2 could
also stimulate nMΦs to proliferate (Figure 6B; p < 0.05).
Western blot analysis suggested that the increased mMΦ
proliferation might be caused by upregulated expression of
cyclin D1 and downregulated p27Kip1 (Figure 6C), which
are positive and negative, respectively, regulators of cell
cycle progression. The chemokine neutralizing antibodies
altered cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 expression in mMΦs
(Figure 6D), suggesting that these chemokines were
responsible for upregulated cyclin D1 and downregulated
p27Kip1. Furthermore, mMΦs displayed activated PI3KAkt and MAPK/Erk pathways and upregulated c-myc
and IL-6 expression (Figure 6E). Similarly, addition of
these chemokines to nMΦ could activate these signaling
pathways. As upregulated c-myc and IL-6 expression are
considered hallmarks for TAMs or mMΦs [3, 13], these
findings suggested that these chemokines could also
polarize nMΦs to mMΦs. Finally we showed that the
PI3K-Akt inhibitor LY294002 and MAPK/Erk inhibitor
U0126 reduced mMΦ proliferation (Figure 6F; p < 0.01).
Taken together, our findings suggested that the chemokines
CCL2, CCL3 and CCL14 not only regulated MO/MΦ
chemoattraction, but also controlled mMΦ proliferation
within the MM tumor bed and induced MΦ polarization
toward mMΦs.

MΦs are major tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells.

CCL14 chemotactic activity on MOs is relatively low
until this chemokine is proteolytically processed by serine
proteases, after which the CCL14 chemotactic activity on
MOs increases 100-1000 fold [30]. Very few studies have
been published that address CCL14 function in human
cancer. Michiels et al. showed that CCL14 was increased
in the oral fluids of head and neck cancer patients [31]. Li
et al suggested that CCL14 might promote angiogenesis
and metastasis of breast cancer [32]. In this study, we
found that CCL14 was overexpressed in MM BM and
regulated MO recruitment to the tumor bed.
CCL3, CCL14 and CCL2 all belong to the CC
chemokine family. CCL3 and CCL14 share the same
receptors, CCR1 and CCR5, whereas CCL2 binds to
CCR2 [11]. All these CCRs are G protein-coupled
transmembrane receptors that can initiate intracellular
signaling transduction depending on the cell type and
ligand-receptor axis specificity [33]. In our study, we
showed that in MΦs, CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2 activated
the PI3K-Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways, both of which
promote cell proliferation. Previous studies have shown
that downstream of activation CCR1, the receptor for
CCL3, CCL14 and many other chemokines, leads to
PI3K-Akt [34] and MAPK/Erk signaling [35]. In addition,
CCR2 may also initiate intracellular MAPK/Erk activation
[36]. Although there is no evidence for CCR5-induced
PI3K-Akt or MAPK/Erk activation, CCR5 may alter cell
signaling by activating the JNK and p38MAPK pathways
[37]. Both PI3K-Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways are
closely related to cell proliferation. Zhou et al has shown
that activation of Akt results in upregulation of cyclin D
and downregulation of p27 in BM MΦs [38]. Therefore,
upon binding to their receptors, CCL3, CCL14, and CCL2
not only lead to MO/MΦ chemoattraction, but may also
promote MO/MΦ proliferation and polarization to mMΦs.
To summarize, we analyzed MO/MΦ chemokines
expressed in MM BM, and identified CCL3, CCL14,
and CCL2 as functional chemokines that were
responsible for increased MΦ infiltration in the MM BM
microenvironment. We also found that these chemokines
promoted mMΦ proliferation within the tumor bed and
polarization of normal MΦs to mMΦs via activation of
the PI3K-Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. Because mMΦs
confer MM chemoresistance, targeting those chemokines
may prevent MΦ infiltration in the tumor bed, and
therefore may improve the efficacy of MM chemotherapy.

μg/ml streptomycin at 37oC and 5% CO2. Mouse 5TGM1
myeloma cells expressing the luciferase gene were kindly
provided by Dr. Frederic Reu, Cleveland Clinic. 5TGM1
cells were cultured in IMDM medium with 10% FBS
and antibiotics. Primary MM cells from MM patients
were purified by CD138+ magnetic beads (Stemcell
Technologies).
Human (patients and healthy volunteers) MΦs were
generated from the buffy coat as described previously [3].
In general, buffy coat mononuclear cells were incubated in
6-well plates for 1-2 hours at 37° to remove nonadherent
cells. Adherent cells were incubated for 5-7 days in media
containing recombinant human M-CSF (10 ng/ml) to
promote conversion to normal macrophages (nMΦs).
Polarization to mMΦs was achieved by coculturing nMΦs
in a transwell system with ARP-1 or MM.1S MM cells for
another 48-72 hours.
In some experiments, MOs were isolated from
buffy coat using MO enrichment kit (Stemcell). For MO
proliferation assay, purified MOs were labeled with CFSE,
seeded in 24-well plates, and cocultured with or without
MM cells for 7 days. For MO migration assay, CFSElabeled MOs were directly used in the assay.
Human BMSCs were obtained from BM aspirates
and cultured in vitro as previously described [39]. In
brief, BM mononuclear cells from healthy donors were
seeded and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin. Medium was changed every 2-4 days, and
adherent cells were maintained in culture. Early passage
cells (< 5 passages) were used in the experiment.

Patient samples and controls
BM aspirates were from of newly diagnosed patients
with MM or MGUS. BM aspirates from healthy donors
were used as controls. The same patients and volunteers
also provided blood samples to generate mononuclear
cells. All of the human participants provided written
informed consent, and this study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Cleveland Clinic and
the Ethics Committees of the First Affiliated Hospital
of Zhejiang University, Medical College. The plasma
of MM BM aspirates was used for ELISA detection of
chemokines. Cells from BM aspirates were used for flow
cytometry analysis of MΦs. CD68 and CD14 double
positive cells were considered as BM MΦs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Cells

The 5TGM1 MM mouse model was used for the
animal study. 5TGM1 cells were intravenously inoculated
into 6-week-old C57BL/KawRij mice (1 million cells/
mouse), and tumor development was monitored by

Human MM cell lines MM.1S, ARP-1, RPMI-8226
and U266 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10%

luciferase activity using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS,
PerkinElmer). Mouse plasma was collected at specified
time points when animals were euthanized, and tumor
burden was also monitored by measuring mouse IgG2b
by ELISA. The percentage of CD138+ MM cells in rear
leg BM was determined by flow cytometry. In some
experiment, peritoneal MΦs were isolated from C57BL/
KawRij mice. In brief, mice were euthanized and a small
incision was made on the abdomen skin. Sterile PBS
was injected into the caudal to suspend residual cells.
The cell suspension was harvested and spun down for
peritoneal MΦs. To determine proliferation of human MΦs
in the tumor bed in vivo, a human MM xenograft SCID
mouse model was established as previously described
[4] by injecting human MOs together with MM cells. All
experiments complied with protocols approved by IACUC
committee at the Cleveland Clinic.

MOs migration to the lower chamber in medium only was
the control. For quantification of the results, migrated cells
in three randomly chosen view zones were counted and the
mean value was used for plotting. In some experiments,
chemokine neutralizing antibody or control IgG were
added in the coculture (a final concentration of 10 μg/ml)
to neutralize the chemokines.

Immunohistochemistry staining
Paraffin-embedded human MM and healthy BM
biopsies (US Biomax, Rockville, MD, USA) and mouse
tissues were used for immunohistochemistry staining with
a kit (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) following
manufacturer’s instructions. For murine myeloma tissue
preparation, the mouse hind leg bone was fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde solution for 3 days. After fixation, the
bone was socked in decalcification solution (10% EDTA
solution) for 3-4 weeks before paraffin embedding and
section.

Antibodies and reagents
Neutralizing antibodies to human CCL3 (MAB270),
CCL14 (MAB3241) and CCL2 (MAB679), and mouse
CCL3 (AB-450-NA), CCL2 (AB-479-NA) were
purchased from R&D Systems. Immunohistochemistry
antibodies to human CCL3, CCL14 and CCL2 and mouse
F4/80 were purchased from Santa Cruz Bio. Western blot
antibodies against cyclin D1, p27Kip1, c-myc, pAkt, Akt,
pErk, Erk, IL6, c-myc, pp38MAPK, p38MAPK, and
α-actin were from Cell Signaling. FITC-, PE, and APCconjugated monoclonal antibodies to human CD14, CD68,
CCR1, CCR2, CCR5 and mouse CD14, CD138, F4/80
were from purchased Biolegend.
The CellTrace CFSE kit was purchased from
Invitrogen. Cell proliferation was analyzed using an MTS
kit (Promega) following the standard protocol. Propidium
iodide (PI) and RNase were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with RNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The expressions of target genes were analyzed
by qPCR using SYBR green real-time PCR system
(StepOne Plus, Applied Bio systems). The expression
of housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as an internal
control. Primer used as follows (primer sequence 5’3’): Forward: ACATCTCACAAAGCATCCCG and
Reverse: TCATGCAATCCTGAACTCCC for human
CCL14; Forward: TGTCCCAAAGAAGCTGTGATC and
Reverse: ATTCTTGGGTTGTGGAGTGAG for human
CCL2; Forward: AACCTTCACCTCTCATGCTG and
Reverse: TGGAAACTGAATCTGGCTGAG for human
CCL8; Forward: AGACCAAACCAGAAACCTCC and
Reverse: AGTATTAATCCCAACTGGCTGA for human
CCL7; Forward: CACTCAACGTCCCATCTACTTG
and Reverse: AGATCTCCTTGCCCAGTTTG for human
CCL13; Forward: CGGCAGATTCCACAGAATTTC and
Reverse: AGGTCGCTGACATATTTCTGG for human
CCL3; Forward: TCCTCGCAACTTTGTGGTAG and
Reverse: TTCAGTTCCAGGTCATACACG for human
CCL4; Forward: CTGCTTTGCCTACATTGCCC and
Reverse: CTTGTTCAGCCGGGAGTCAT for human
CCL5; Forward: ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTC and
Reverse: CCACTTTACCAGAGTTAAAAGCAG for
human GAPDH.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Chemokines in BM aspirates or cell culture
supernatant (kits from R&D Systems) and circulating
mouse IgG2b in mouse plasma (kits from eBioscience)
were analyzed by ELISA.

Chemotactic assay
When BMSCs reached 70% confluence, they were
directly cocultured with MM cells (2 × 105 cells per
well) in 24-well plates. CFSE-labeled MOs were put in
transwell inserts (pore size: 5 μm, Corning) and cocultured
with MM/BMSC or primary MM BM cells overnight.
MOs migrating to the lower chamber were detected by
fluorescent microscopy (50 ×, Leica) for CFSE+ cells.
