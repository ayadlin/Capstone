The Clinical Experience

Abstract
The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. This
information has revitalized basic and clinical research into the molecular biology of NET and has resulted in
the recent approval of new therapies for pancreatic NET (pNET), including the oral inhibitor of the mTOR
everolimus. Everolimus signiﬁcantly improved progression-free survival among patients with pNET in the
phase III RADIANT-3 study. Here, we review the clinical studies showing the efﬁcacy of everolimus in pNET
and summarize the translational science from these studies. To understand the mechanisms of resistance
and cause of treatment failure, we compared the type of progression events observed in the everolimus and
placebo arms of the RADIANT-3 study. Comparison of the everolimus arm to the placebo arm indicated
the fractions of progression events due to new metastasis only (21% vs. 22%), growth of preexisting lesions
only (54% vs. 49%), and new metastasis along with growth of preexisting lesions (24% vs. 27%) were
similar. These results suggest that although everolimus delays disease progression in patients with pNET,
patients who experience disease progression while on everolimus do not appear to have a more aggressive
metastatic phenotype than those whose disease progresses while on placebo. Cancer Res; 73(5); 1449–53.

Introduction
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) occur at an
incidence of 3 per 1 million persons per year and account for
a small fraction of all pancreatic malignancies (1). However,
because patient survival with pNET is longer than with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the prevalence of pNET is higher,
accounting for 10% of pancreatic malignancies (2). In treating
these patients, physicians are faced with the parallel challenges
of controlling the often dramatic manifestations of both hormone hypersecretion and cancer growth.
Results from 2 phase III trials of oral targeted agents for
pNET have recently been published. Table 1 summarizes the
data from a diverse group of clinical trials. No direct
comparison can be made among trials conducted over a
period of 2 decades with different enrollment criteria given
advances in the supportive care for and treatment of
patients with cancer. One can conclude that all these agents
have some activity in this disease, but one cannot directly
compare the outcomes (3–8).

Recent advances have signiﬁcantly improved our understanding of the molecular biology underlying pNET (Fig. 1;
ref. 9). Genetic cancer syndromes associated with pNET
include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, tuberous sclerosis, neuroﬁbromatosis, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (10).
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is the direct inhibitor of
mTOR. Loss of the neuroﬁbromatosis 1 gene leads to constitutive mTOR activation. A recent study (11) using an exome
sequencing approach among patients with sporadic pNET
identiﬁed 3 key groups of somatic mutations involving MEN1,
DAXX/ATRX, and the mTOR pathway. Evidence suggests that
MEN1 mutation or deletion leads to the downregulation of p27
and p18, driving cell cycling and proliferation (12, 13). Loss of
DAXX/ATRX is associated with alternative lengthening of
telomeres, allowing for unlimited replication without senescence (14). mTOR pathway abnormalities, on the other hand,
are reported to be associated with increased aggressiveness
(Fig. 2; refs. 15, 16). Low protein expression of the mTOR
pathway components TSC2 and PTEN was associated with
shortened progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
among patients with pNET (17). Thus, clues from germline
mutations, somatic mutations, and protein level expression
support the conduct of clinical studies of the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus in patients with pNET.
Everolimus has been studied in the largest development
program in pNET. Three human phase II or III studies included
600 patients with advanced pNET (5, 18, 19). In this article, we
review the knowledge gained from clinical data and translational science thus far and analyze the pattern of failure in the
large placebo-controlled RADIANT (RAD001 in Advanced
Neuroendocrine Tumors)-3 study.

advanced pNET with or without progression were treated
with octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) 30 mg
intramuscularly (IM) every 4 weeks along with everolimus
at 5 or 10 mg/d orally (18). Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) proﬁles were monitored
by multiphasic computed tomography or MRI every
12 weeks. Patients consenting to the optional correlative
studies underwent image-guided core needle biopsy of
metastatic lesions before and after 2 weeks of everolimus
therapy.
RADIANT-1 study
RADIANT-1 was an open-label phase II study that
screened 186 patients from 51 sites and enrolled 160 patients
from 36 sites in 11 countries. One hundred ﬁfteen patients
not undergoing treatment with octreotide at study entry
were assigned to stratum 1 (everolimus 10 mg/d orally), and
45 patients undergoing treatment with octreotide LAR were
assigned to stratum 2 [everolimus 10 mg/d orally and
octreotide LAR IM every 28 days at the prestudy dose
(30 mg); ref. 19]. All patients had advanced pNET with
progressive disease documented by RECIST during or after
cytotoxic chemotherapy.
RADIANT-3 study
RADIANT-3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III study that enrolled 410 patients from 82
centers in 18 countries. Patients with advanced pNET and
progressive disease were randomly assigned to treatment with
everolimus or matching placebo (5). Octreotide LAR could be
used as concurrent medication for the management of symptoms related to hormone secretion.

included an additional 30 patients with carcinoid tumors
(i.e., non-pNET), a higher response rate was observed
among patients treated with 10 mg/d everolimus (30%)
than with 5 mg/d everolimus (13%). Everolimus treatment
was associated with dose- and time-dependent increases in
blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Larger increases in
LDH from baseline and longer PFS were associated with
the 10-mg dose level. Evaluation from paired pre- and
posttreatment biopsy specimens showed that everolimus
slowed tumor proliferation, as shown by reduced Ki-67
labeling (18).
One consequence of mTOR inhibition is the downregulation of p-S6K, which may lead to Akt activation, at least in
part, by feedback loop activation through an insulin receptor
substrate–dependent mechanism (20, 21). Such activation
has been proposed to lead to increased tumor aggressiveness
and may be a possible resistance mechanism. We therefore
evaluated the effect of mTOR inhibition on Akt/mTOR
signaling in vitro in xenograft models and in paired biopsies
from patients before and after treatment with everolimus. In
vitro, cell lines that had greater rapamycin sensitivity had
greater feedback loop activation of Akt with treatment (20).

only (20). In paired tumor biopsy specimens obtained in the
clinical trial, treatment with everolimus was associated with
decreases in p-S6 S240/244 (P ¼ 0.003 compared with
pretreatment baseline) and p-S6 235/236 (P ¼ 0.02) levels
and increases in p-Akt levels. Patients who experienced
response per RECIST after everolimus therapy were more
likely to have increased p-Akt T308 levels from baseline
than patients who did not achieve radiologic response (P ¼
0.01; ref. 20).
RADIANT-1 study
Among patients with progressive disease during or after
previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, the response rate was
9.6% (95% CI, 4.9%–16.5%) for patients receiving everolimus
and 4.4% (95% CI, 0.5%–15.1%) for patients receiving everolimus plus octreotide LAR (19). Median PFS by central
radiology review was 9.7 months (95% CI, 8.3–13.3) for those
receiving everolimus and 16.7 months (95% CI, 11.1–NA) for
those receiving the combination of everolimus and octreotide LAR.
Biomarker analyses showed high baseline chromogranin A
and neuron-speciﬁc enolase to be prognostic of inferior PFS
and overall survival (22). Furthermore, early biomarker
response, deﬁned as a 30% decrease at week 4 from baseline,
was associated with signiﬁcantly improved PFS.

RADIANT-3 study
RADIANT-3 is the largest clinical trial thus far conducted
in patients with pNET. In this randomized phase III study,
everolimus therapy was associated with a 2.4-fold improvement in median PFS compared with placebo (5). Median
PFS was 11 months in the everolimus arm compared with
4.6 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.27–0.45;
log-rank test, P < 0.0001). Everolimus also signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor-secreted hormones associated with functional syndromes among patients with functional pNET
(5, 23, 24).
This large randomized phase III study also assessed
circulating blood markers associated with angiogenesis.
Everolimus treatment was associated with reductions in
VEGF pathway markers, including soluble VEGF receptor
2, and placental growth factor, suggesting that everolimus
may also have an antiangiogenic effect in patients with
pNET (25). The prognostic and predictive relevance of
baseline and treatment-induced change in VEGF pathway
biomarkers is undergoing further investigation. Although
paired biopsy specimens were not feasible in this large
international phase III study, an effort was made to collect
parafﬁn-embedded archival tumor material. An analysis of
collected samples is also planned.
Although everolimus clearly inhibited tumor growth and
delayed time to progression among patients with pNET, the
presence of a placebo control arm afforded an opportunity to
examine the pattern of treatment failure. At the time of the
ﬁnal PFS analysis, 98 progression events were reported in the
everolimus arm and 161 progression events were reported in
the placebo arm (Table 2). Percentages of progression events
attributed to the emergence of new metastasis as the only
cause of progression were similar (21% in the everolimus arm
vs. 22% in the placebo arm). The appearance of new metastasis
concurrent with the progression of preexisting lesions
occurred in 24% of progression events in the everolimus arm
and 27% in the placebo arm. Lesion growth at baseline without
the appearance of new metastasis occurred in 54% of progression events in the everolimus arm and 49% in the placebo arm.

These data suggest that everolimus delayed tumor progression
without changing the pattern of progression among patients
with advanced pNET.

Discussion
Recent years have seen signiﬁcant improvement in our
understanding of the molecular biology underlying genetic
cancer syndromes involving pNET and the somatic mutations
associated with sporadic pNET. These advances have supported the successful development of everolimus as a new
drug for advanced pNET.
Although cell lines, xenograft models, and rodent models
recapitulate to some degree the behavior of human pNET,
they cannot fully model the behavior of well-differentiated
pNET in humans and are less desirable for attempts at
understanding the mechanisms of resistance. Fundamentally, well-differentiated NET in humans are slow growing, have
a Ki-67 of 1% to 20%, and have a doubling time in the range
of 5 to 12 months. Existing neuroendocrine cell lines, on the
other hand, are aggressive, rapidly proliferative, and have a
Ki-67 well more than 70% (26). They can also harbor genetic
abnormalities that do not frequently occur in human pNET.
For example, the BON line has been described to carry a
PIK3CA mutation that is rare (1.8%) in human pNET (11).
Another example is the RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mouse model,
which introduces the T-antigen that binds to p53 and pRb
(27) pathways generally thought to be intact in human
pNET.
Our experience with human studies suggests that although
baseline Akt activation is associated with a more aggressive
clinical course, increases in p-Akt are expected consequences
of successful mTOR inhibition and are not markers of drug
resistance (20). Our analyses of the pattern of failure in
RADIANT-3 showed that everolimus delayed tumor progression compared with placebo and delayed a similar fraction of
progression that ultimately occurred due to new or newly
detected metastasis. These analyses do not show an increased
metastatic phenotype to be a principal mechanism of resistance to or failure of everolimus.
Efforts to further build on the successful approval of
everolimus in pNET are under way. Clinical studies
combining everolimus with drugs that may modulate the
insulin-like growth factor 1 pathway (e.g., pasireotide and
cixutumumab) are ongoing. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
can also be blocked at multiple points using serine–threonine kinase inhibitors that simultaneously inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR (e.g., BEZ235). Studies
combining everolimus with VEGFR inhibitors also hold
promise.
