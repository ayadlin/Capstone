ABSTRACT
This study aimed to investigate the associations of XPC c.2815A>C, XPD c.934G>A
and c.2251A>C, XPF c.2505T>C and ERCC1 c.354C>T single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) of nucleotide excision repair pathway in outcome of head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with cisplatin (CDDP) chemoradiation.
Patients with XPC c.2815AC or CC and XPD c.934GA or AA genotypes had 0.20 and
0.38 less chances of presenting moderate/severe ototoxicity and nausea, respectively.
Patients with XPD c.934AA and c.2251AC or CC genotypes had 8.64, 12.29 and 3.55
more chances of achieving complete response (CR), consistent ototoxicity and
nephrotoxicity, respectively. AA haplotype of XPD and ACT haplotype of XPD and
ERCC1 SNPs were associated with 9.30 and 3.41 more chances of achieving CR and
consistent nephrotoxicity, respectively. At 24 months of follow-up, patients with XPD
c.934AA genotype presented lower progression-free survival and overall survival
in Kaplan-Meier estimates, and differences between groups remained the same in
univariate Cox analysis. Patients with XPD c.934AA genotype had 2.13 and 2.04 more
risks of presenting tumor progression and death than others in multivariate Cox
analysis. Our data present preliminary evidence that XPC c.2815A>C, XPD c.934G>A
and c.2251A>C, and ERCC1 c.354C>T SNPs alter outcome of HNSCC patients treated
with CDDP chemoradiation.

About two-thirds of HNSCC patients exhibit
advanced stage disease at diagnosis [2], and cisplatin
(CDDP) associated with radiotherapy (RT) has been used
in their treatment [3]. RT induces DNA damage directly
by action of photons and indirectly by liberation of free
radicals [4]. CDDP develops adducts with cellular DNA

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is the sixth most common human cancer, with a worldwide
incidence of 600,000 new cases and approximately
350,000 deaths are attributed to tumor each year [1].

and also releases free radicals [5]. In both cases, damaged
cells are induced to apoptosis when not adequately
repaired, particularly by nucleotide excision repair (NER)
pathway [6].
The xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) genes, including
complementation group C (XPC), D (XPD), F (XPF) and
excision repair cross-complementation group1 (ERCC1),
operate in NER pathway, and participate of recognition,
demarcation and removal of DNA damage induced by
CDDP and RT [7].
Variations in tumor sensitivity to CDDP [8-21], RT
[22, 23] and CDDP associated with RT [24-26], as well
as in side effects of therapeutic modalities [10, 14, 27,
28], have been attributed to distinct activities of proteins
encoded by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
genes involved in DNA repair through NER pathway.
The variant alleles of XPC c.2815A>C
(p.Lys939Gln)
(rs2228001),
XPD
c.934G>A
(p.Asp312Asn) (rs1799793) and XPD c.2251A>C
(p.Lys751Gln) (rs13181) SNPs determine activity of
protein reduction, with consequent lower function in
DNA repair capacity (DRC) [29, 30]. The variant alleles
of XPF c.2505T>C (p.Ser835Ser) (rs1799801) and
ERCC1 c.354C>T (p.Asn118Asn) (rs11615) SNPs can
be associated with a reduction of mRNA stability or
processing, and lower DRC [31-33].
The XPC c.2815A>C [14-17], XPD c.934G>A
and c.2251A>C [8-10, 13, 14, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28], XPF
c.2505T>C [26], and ERCC1 c.354C>T [10-12, 15, 16,
18, 21, 25, 26, 28] SNPs were associated with variable
response rate (RR), toxicity, progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with different
tumors treated with CDDP-based chemotherapy with or
without RT; however only few studies were conducted in
HNSCC patients [24, 25].
In the present study, we investigated whether the
above-mentioned SNPs alter the outcome of HNSCC
patients treated with CDDP and RT.

(24.5%) received only two CDDP infusions due to renal
or hematologic toxicities; the median cumulative dose of
CDDP in patients was 265 mg (range: 100 to 616). Most
of patients (97.7%) had medium or high adherence to
antiemetics.
Partial response and stable disease were seen in near
80.0% of patients. About two-thirds and one-third of cases
had moderate/severe nausea and vomiting, respectively,
one-third to half of cases presented moderate/severe
hematologic toxicities and half of cases had moderate/
severe nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity (Table 2).
The mean ± standard deviation of urinary CDDP
was 237.0 μg/mg ± 116.2.
The median follow-up time of 90 HNSCC patients
enrolled in study was 18.6 months (range: 3.3-48.9). The
estimated probabilities of 24-months PFS and OS were
37.6% and 42.4%, respectively. At the date of analysis,
September 2015, 31 patients were alive, 7 of them with
HNSCC and 24 without HNSCC and 59 patients died, 56
of them by the tumor effects and 3 by unrelated causes.
The linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed
a LD between XPD c.934G>A and XPD c.2251A>C (D’=
64%), XPD c.934G>A and ERCC1 c.354C>T (D’= 54%),
and XPD c.2251A>C and ERCC1 c.354C>T (D’= 51%)
SNPs. From the theoretical eight possible XPD haplotypes
for c.934G>A and c.2251A>C SNPs, four were found to be
common (frequency > 1%: GA, GC, AA, AC). Only seven
out of eighteen possible XPD and ERCC1 haplotypes for
c.934G>A, c.2251A>C and c.354C>T SNPs were found
to be common (frequency > 1%: GAC, GCC, AAC, ACC,
GAT, GCT, ACT). The common haplotypes of referred
SNPs were included in further analysis.

Polymorphisms, response rate and toxicity
The frequencies of referred genotypes and
haplotypes of HNSCC patients stratified by RR and
toxicity to chemoradiotherapy are presented in Table
3. The XPC c.2815AC or CC genotypes were less
common than AA genotype in patients with moderate/
severe ototoxicity (40.4% versus 65.2%). Patients with
AC or CC genotypes had 0.20 less chance of moderate/
severe ototoxicity than others. The XPD c.934AA
variant genotype was more frequent than GG or GA
genotypes in patients with complete response (CR) after
chemoradiotherapy (42.9% versus 18.2%). Carriers of
variant genotype AA had 8.64 more chances of achieving
CR than others. The maximum changes from baseline
in the sum of reference diameters of target lesions in
HNSCC patients with XPD c.934G>A SNP genotypes
are presented in Figure 1A and 1B; patients with variant
genotype had more median change than those with
wild-type or heterozygous genotypes of XPD c.934G>A
SNP (-63.0% versus -52.5%) of presenting response to
chemoradiotherapy. The XPD c.934AA genotype was also
more frequent than the GG or GA genotypes in patients

RESULTS
Study population
Most of 90 patients enrolled in study were male and
with a history of tobacco and alcohol consumption. About
two-thirds of cases had tumor in pharynx and most of
patients presented well or moderately differentiated tumor
and tumor in advanced stages. Human papillomavirus
(HPV) type 16 was negative in all analyzed cases
(Table 1).
All patients received RT with a total dose of 70
Gy and CDDP at initial dose of 80-100 mg/m2. Thirteen
patients with consistent side effects after the first infusion
of CDDP, received lower dose (50-75 mg/m2) of agent in
following administrations. Sixty-eight patients (75.5%)
received three infusions of CDDP and 22 patients

with moderate/severe ototoxicity (85.7% versus 44.4%).
Patients with AA genotype had 12.29 more chances of
consistent ototoxicity than others. In contrast, the XPD
c.934GA or AA genotypes were less common than the
GG genotype in patients with moderate/severe nausea
(48.8% versus 66.0%). Carriers of variant A allele had
0.38 less chance of moderate/severe nausea than those
with the wild-type genotype. An excess of XPD c.2251AC
or CC genotypes compared to the AA genotype were seen
in patients with moderate/severe nephrotoxicity (62.2%
versus 31.3%). Carriers of variant C allele had 3.55 more
chances of consistent nephrotoxicity than others. The AA
haplotype (variant allele of XPD c.934G>A and wild-type
allele of XPD c.2251A>C) was more common in patients
with CR than those with other common haplotypes
(44.4% versus 19.0%). Individuals with AA haplotype

Similar frequencies of genotypes, alone or
combined, and haplotypes of corresponding SNPs were
seen in patients stratified by hematologic toxicities and

DISCUSSION

versus 83.3%, P= 0.03) and XPD c.934AA genotype
(10.0% versus 41.2%, P= 0.02) (Figure 1C); a shorter
OS was also observed in patients with advanced tumor
stage (38.4% versus 100.0%, P= 0.02) and XPD c.934AA
genotype (10.0% versus 46.9%, P= 0.02) (Figure 1D) at
this time (Kaplan-Meier estimates).
Associations of clinical and tumor characteristics
and referred genotypes with survival of HNSCC patients
in Cox analyses are presented in Table 4. In univariate
Cox analysis, a tendency for shorter PFS and shorter
PFS were seen in patients with advanced tumor stage
and in those with XPD c.934AA genotype, respectively.
Only the XPD c.934AA genotype was associated with
shorter PFS in multivariate Cox analysis; individuals
with XPD c.934AA genotype had 2.13 more risks to
present tumor progression than those with the remaining
genotypes. In univariate Cox analysis, a shorter OS was
seen in patients with advanced tumor stage and in those
with XPD c.934AA genotype. Only the XPD c.934AA
genotype was associated with shorter OS in multivariate
Cox analysis; individuals with XPD c.934AA genotype
had 2.04 more risks of death than those with the
remaining genotypes.

We initially found that clinical and tumor aspects [3,
22, 24, 34, 35], RR, toxicity to chemoradiation and short
survival in advanced tumor stages [3, 34-36] in our sample
were similar to those previously described in other parts
of world. Therefore, they were adequate for analysis of
new prognostic factors in disease. Low prevalence of HPV
infection was seen in our cases, as previously reported [37,
38], suggesting that the major factors enrolled in tumor
development were tobacco and alcohol consumption.
Secondly, we found that XPC c.2815AC or CC
genotype was associated with reduced ototoxicity. The
AA genotype was related to less hearing impairment in
osteosarcoma patients treated with CDDP [14]. Our finding
was not expected, since the wild-type A allele of XPC
c.2815A>C SNP was previously associated with higher
DRC [30], and possibly with protection against hearing
loss. However, variant C and wild-type A alleles of XPC
c.2815A>C were also associated with similar DRC [39].
Thus, additional studies are required to evaluate the bind of
XPC c.2815A>C with ototoxicity in HNSCC patients treated
with CDDP chemoradiation.

c.2251A>C and ERCC1 c.354C>T SNPs, indicating that
the SNPs in XPD and ERCC1 genes may act together
in DRC, with effects on clinical manifestation in those
patients.
Finally, we found shorter PFS and OS in patients
with XPD c.934AA variant genotype. Corroborating our
findings, this genotype was previously reported with
shorter OS in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated
with platinum [9, 19]. In contrast, XPD c.934AA variant
genotype was related with longer PFS and/or OS in
HNSCC [24] and esophageal cancer [13] patients, and did
not influence survival in non-small cell lung cancer [8, 10,
12, 15, 20, 26] and ovarian cancer [28] patients treated
with platinum or CDDP with or without RT. The variant
allele of XPD c.934G>A SNP determines lower function in
DRC [29], which may induced high apoptosis in response
to CDDP chemoradiation in tumor cells and high RR in
HNSCC. It is well known that the TP53 gene has a crucial
role in induction of apoptosis [40]; however, the tobacco
consumption was associated with increased risk of TP53
mutations in previous analyzed HNSCC patients [41], and
might have produced the same effect in our cases. Facing
these descriptions, we hypothesized that HNSCC patients
with XPD c.934AA variant genotype and non-functional
TP53 protein could lead to decrease DRC induced
by CDDP chemoradiation and consequent decreased
apoptosis of tumor cells. This could constitute a possible
reason for the initial sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy and
further poor prognosis (PFS and OS) seen in our cases,
as previously reported in small cell lung cancer patients

Third, as previously reported, we found that AA
genotype of XPD c.934G>A SNP was associated with
CR in HNSCC patients [24]. The XPD c.934GA or AA
genotypes and AA genotype were associated with reduced
manifestation of nausea and moderate/severe ototoxicity
in our cases, respectively. Nephrotoxicity was also more
common in our patients with the XPD c.2251AC or CC
genotypes. A possible explanation for these associations
is that variant A and C alleles of XPD c.934G>A and
c.2251A>C SNPs determine lower DRC [29], which
could induced more apoptosis in tumor cells and normal
outer hairs and renal tubular cells in response to CDDP
chemoradiation. The reduced DRC in patients with
GA or AA genotypes of XPD c.934G>A SNP may also
induce more apoptosis in epithelial enterochromaffin
cells of intestine of treated patients, resulting in absence
of serotonin release, and consequent lack of stimuli in
chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting center. No
associations of XPD c.934G>A and c.2251A>C SNPs with
RR and toxicities were seen in non-small cell lung cancer
[8, 10, 12, 15, 19, 20, 26], osteosarcoma [14] and ovarian
cancer [28] patients treated with CDDP with or without
RT. The divergent results may be caused by differences in
sample sizes, tumor types, antiemetic therapies, hydration
conditions, and doses of CDDP in our and previously
reported studies.
Fourth, the AA haplotype of XPD c.934G>A and
c.2251A>C SNPs was associated with increased chance
of obtaining CR, and nephrotoxicity was predominately
seen in patients with ACT haplotype of XPD c.934G>A,

[42]. The divergent results seen in previous studies and
our study may be attributed to different sample sizes,
treatment types, antiemetic therapies, hydration conditions
and follow-up times.
In conclusion, our findings presented preliminary
evidence that XPC c.2815A>C, XPD c.934G>A, XPD
c.2251A>C and ERCC1 c.354C>T SNPs alter clinical
outcome of HNSCC patients treated with CDDP
chemoradiation. We believe that in the near future,
pharmacogenetic studies in HNSCC can contribute to
personalize treatment and optimize patient outcome.

ml of saline 0.9% and oral dexamethasone 8 mg (every
12 hours) and metoclopramida 10 mg (every 6 hours)
during three days after each CDDP infusion [50, 51]. The
antiemetics adherence was classified as high or medium
adherence or non-adherence [52].
Nausea, vomiting, hematologic toxicities,
nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were assessed using
information of adverse effects, hematologic exams,
51
Cr-EDTA glomerular filtration rate and audiometric
tests performed before and after chemoradiotherapy.
The toxicities were evaluated according to the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria version 4.0 [53], and the
worst grade for each toxicity in each patient was included
in analysis.
CDDP in urine of patients collected 0 to 48
hours after each dose of CDDP was measured by highperformance liquid chromatographic [54]. The final
concentration of urinary CDDP was considered as the sum
of all measurements obtained after each administration of
agent.
Surgical tumor resection was offered to patients
with good clinical condition and partial response or
tumor relapse. Patients not amenable to resection and
with progressive disease or relapse received intravenous
methotrexate at dose of 40 mg/m2 once a week until best
response, limiting toxicity or progression of disease [55].
The follow-up of patients was performed at 3-month
intervals. The end of follow-up period was September
2015.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients, treatment and clinical variables
This prospective study comprised HNSCC patients
seen at diagnosis at the Clinical Oncology Service of
General Hospital of University of Campinas between
June 2011 and February 2014. All patients were selected
to CDDP chemoradiation as definitive treatment due to
locoregional unresectable tumor, refusal of surgery facing
expected functional or anatomic sequels, or an organ
preservation protocol. Exclusion criteria were refusing
to participate in study, low Karnofsky performance scale
score and renal dysfunction. The study was conducted
according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the institutional review board guidelines (nº 274/2011).
The data relating to age, gender, body mass index,
tobacco and alcohol consumption, hematologic and
biochemistry exams, tumor location, histological grade
and stage were obtained from patient charts. Subjects
were classified as smokers or non-smokers and drinkers
or abstainers as previously reported [43]. The tumor was
diagnosed by standard criteria [44] and staged by the
criteria of American Joint Committee of Cancer [45].
HPV testing consisted of P16 immunohistochemistry
in tumor fragments embedded in paraffin. Staining was
regarded as positive if it was strong and diffuse (> 80% of
tumor cells) and it was regarded as negative if absent or
focal [46]. Wide spectrum HPV in situ hybridization was
reserved for P16-positive cases. Punctate hybridization
signals localized to the tumor cell nuclei in either analysis
defined an HPV-positive tumor [47].
Concurrent single daily fractionated radiation (2 Gy/
day) during 35 days and intravenous CDDP at initial dose
of 80-100 mg/m² on days 1, 22 and 43 was administered
to patients; patients with consistent side effects during
treatment received CDDP at lower dose [3, 48]. RR
to chemoradiotherapy was assessed using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines
version 1.1 [49].
As hydration and antiemetic protocols, the patients
received intravenous 3,000 ml of saline 0.9%, 125 ml of
20% mannitol, ondansetron 24 mg and dexamethasone 20
mg before CDDP infusion, as well as intravenous 2,000

DNA extraction and genotyping
The genotyping procedure was performed using
genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood of patients
and involved a polymerase chain reaction followed by
the enzymatic digestion, as reported for XPC c.2815A>C
[56], XPD c.934G>A and XPD c.2251A>C [57], XPF
c.2505T>C [33] and ERCC1 c.354C>T [58] SNPs.
Positive and negative controls were used in all genotyping
reactions. The amount of 15% of genotype determinations
was carried out twice in independent experiments with
100% of concordance.

Statistical analysis
The pairwise LD was performed using the
Haploview 4.2 software to ensure that the markers were
appropriate for inclusion in the XPD and ERCC1 haplotype
estimates. The LD was measured by the disequilibrium
coefficient (D’). The D’ values ≤ 1 indicate LD.
The differences between groups were analyzed by
chi-square (χ2) or Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression
model served to obtain odds ratios values, adjusted
for clinicopathological aspects with P-values ≤ 0.10,
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), to assess
associations between SNPs genotypes, RR, nausea,

vomiting, hematologic toxicities, nephrotoxicity and
ototoxicity. ANOVA served to obtain values, adjusted
for clinicopathological aspects with P-values ≤ 0.10, in
assessment of associations between SNPs genotypes and
urinary CDDP. This variable was transformed into ranks
to perform the comparative analysis, since it was not
normally distributed.
PFS and OS were defined as time interval between
the date of diagnosis and the date of progression or relapse
of disease, and the date of death by any causes or last
follow-up, respectively. Kaplan-Meier method was used
to plot PFS and OS curves, and log-rank test was applied
to compare the distribution between groups. Multivariate
Cox regression served to estimate hazard ratios values,
adjusted for variables with P-values ≤ 0.10, with 95%
CI, with the purpose of to assess the associations between
SNPs genotypes, PFS and OS.
For statistical tests, significance was two-sided and
achieved when P-values were ≤ 0.05. All tests were done
using the SPSS 21.0 software.
