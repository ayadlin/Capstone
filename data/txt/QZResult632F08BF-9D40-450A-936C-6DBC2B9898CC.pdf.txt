BACKGROUND: Patients aged 80 years who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) have
been reported to have a poor prognosis. In the current study, chemotherapy-related toxicity data were
evaluated between patients aged 80 years and those aged <80 years. METHODS: Patients with OC who
underwent cytoreductive surgery with chemotherapy were included. Self-reported toxicity data were
obtained from National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) forms. Objective indicators of status including albumin level, weight, and creatinine clearance were abstracted both before and after therapy.
Data were compared between patients by decade of age. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients were included.
A presenting Karnofsky performance status >2 was recorded in 17% of patients aged 80 years versus 0%
to 4% of patients aged <80 years (P ¼ .002). Platinum-based chemotherapy was used in all patients. For
patients aged <80 years, combination chemotherapy was used in >90% versus 69% in those aged 80
years (P < .0001). Standard-dose combination therapy was used in 72% to 86% of patients aged <80 years
versus 28% of patients aged 80 years (P < .0001). Patients aged 80 years completed 6 cycles of therapy approximately 57% of the time versus 84% to 97% of the time for those aged <80 years (P ¼ .0001).
CTC forms identified no self-reported toxicities to be more common among patients aged 80 years. Multivariate logistic regression identified creatinine clearance <65 mL/minute (odds ratio [OR] of 4.6), 5%
weight loss (OR of 2.5), prechemotherapy albumin level of <2 g/dL (OR of 3.65), and initiation of therapy
with a single agent (OR of 3.9) as independent predictors of failure to complete chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial treatment modifications as well as toxicity assessment, only 57% of patients aged
80 years completed planned chemotherapy. It was confirmed that further studies into the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapy in the elderly and more sensitive assessment of therapy-related toxicity are

Chemotherapy in Elderly Ovarian Ca Patients/Moore et al

Prescribing treatment for an advanced malignancy
within this framework can be challenging, and often, the
default mode is to immediately assume enough functional
limitations are present to justify treatment modification.
Undertreatment of cancer among elderly patients is a
well-documented practice, with published estimates ranging from 13% to 57%.1 For ovarian cancer, elderly
patients are less likely to undergo aggressive cytoreductive
surgery and less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.
If chemotherapy is given, elderly patients are more likely
to receive a dose reduction than their younger counterparts.1-5 In analyzing all reported series of elderly patients
with advanced ovarian cancer, Bouchardy et al found that
advanced age was a strong determinant of undertreatment
and that the presence of medical comorbid conditions was
less of a determinant.1
The risk is basing treatment decisions on age alone
is that one could potentially deny more effective therapy
to a patient who, other than having advanced age, is fit
enough to tolerate and benefit from standard-of-care
therapy. How best to assess a patient’s functional reserve
before the initiation of therapy is an area of active and
essential study. The need for validated measures of functional reserve and other potential predictors of a patient’s
fitness for therapy is imperative when one considers that
the growth of the ‘‘oldest old,’’ (patients aged 85 years)
is the fastest growing segment of the US population. This
group has increased by >300% between 1960 and 2000
and this growth is expected to continue.6 With an
increase in the proportion of patients surviving into their
90s and beyond, we will see an increase in the number of
women presenting with advanced ovarian cancer. The
ability to appropriately prescribe treatment will depend
on our ability to assess who is able to receive standard-of
care-surgery and chemotherapy and who is better served
by a modification of this regimen.
This study sought to evaluate the use of adjuvant
chemotherapy after cytoreduction among patients aged 80
years with advanced ovarian cancer. Specifically, we were
interested in evaluating patient self-reported toxicities and
physiologic measures in an attempt to correlate which toxicities lead to early therapy termination or dose modification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a single institution, retrospective study. After
obtaining institutional review board approval, a departCancer

mental ovarian cancer database containing all patients
treated at the University of Oklahoma from 1994 through
2006 was used to identify all patients who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy for
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO) stage III or IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer after the year 2000. Included patients
were also treated with primary cytoreductive surgery followed by at least 2 cycles of adjuvant platinum-based
chemotherapy. Exclusion criteria included primary surgery or chemotherapy not administered at the University
of Oklahoma, nonepithelial histology, stage I or II disease,
and unknown outcome data.
Analysis was limited to patients treated after the year
2000 because this is when standardized chemotherapyassociated toxicity assessments with the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were
included in the medical record.7 Patients who underwent
therapy with either neoadjuvant or primary chemotherapy
were excluded based on findings from our prior study. In
this analysis of all patients aged >80 years who presented
with ovarian malignancies, those who did not undergo
primary surgical cytoreduction were found to be significantly more medically fragile than their counterparts who
did undergo surgery and had a markedly shortened overall
survival.8
Medical records were abstracted for age at diagnosis;
medical comorbidities; Karnofsky performance status
(KPS); and prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy albumin level, creatinine clearance, and weight. Creatinine
clearance both before and after chemotherapy was calculated. Medical comorbidity information was recorded as a
categoric variable (yes/no) for a variety of medical conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and emphysema. The
number of separate medical comorbidities was also
recorded. The severity of the medical illness was not captured in this analysis. Surgical information included residual tumor volume and need for radical procedures at the
time of surgery. Chemotherapy information included
agents and doses used, number of cycles, and need for
dose reduction or agent discontinuation. Our institutional standard starting dose for combination carboplatin
and paclitaxel is an area under the curve of 6 and 175 mg/
m2, respectively. The outcome of interest was the completion of 6 cycles of prescribed chemotherapy.

At our institution, chemotherapy-related toxicities
are assessed using the most current CTC categories.7 A
standardized table of toxicities and grades 0 through 4
with descriptions is completed by each patient during
their prechemotherapy visit and then reviewed by the physician. Patients are instructed to circle any toxicities experienced since the last cycle and grade them. In this
manner, both identified toxicity and grade are selfreported by the patient. During the physician visit, the
toxicity sheet is reviewed and any required adjustments in
the treatment regimen are made (Fig. 1).
Patients were evaluated by decade of age. Toxicities
were evaluated by calculating an average toxicity score
based on the number of cycles of chemotherapy actually
received as well as by recording the worst toxicity score for
each toxicity per cycle. Statistical tests for comparisons
were performed as appropriate. Categoric variables were
evaluated by chi-square analysis or the Fisher exact test.
Continuous variables were evaluated by the Student t test.
Test of trend was performed when appropriate. Statistical
significance was established at a P value <.05.

RESULTS
Presenting Characteristics
A total of 246 patients with FIGO stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer were included in the current analysis.
All patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery and
initiated a regimen of adjuvant, platinum-based chemotherapy. Approximately 92% of this cohort was white and
the age range included patients ages 18 to 92 years.
Prechemotherapy characteristics for the cohort,
arranged by decade of age, are presented in Table 1. The
FIGO stage distribution for the cohort was fairly uniform
across age brackets, with 7% to 15% of patients within
each age bracket having stage IIIA/B disease, 71% to 80%
having stage IIIC disease, and 8% to 17.5% having stage
IV disease. These differences were not statistically significant and there was no trend toward more advanced disease
noted with increasing age.
The albumin level (shown in g/dL) and the creatinine
level were collected for each patient at the initiation and
conclusion of chemotherapy. Neither a comparison of median values for albumin nor an evaluation of the difference
between pretherapy and post-therapy values revealed a dif1474

ference between decades of age. There were significant differences when pretherapy and post-therapy mean
creatinine clearance values were evaluated by age. Patients
aged <60 years had creatinine clearance values that
remained within the normal range both before and after
chemotherapy. In patients aged 60 years, the starting
mean creatinine clearance values were abnormally low and
decreased by decade from 77 mL/minute to 49 mL/minute
for those aged 80 years. In each of these age groups, a loss
of approximately 8% in creatinine clearance was noted over
the course of therapy (Table 1). The percentage loss did not
appear to differ across age groups.
The KPS is the standard measure of performance
status at the study institution. Here, there was a significant
difference in the proportion of patients with a KPS of 2.
For patients aged 80 years, 17% had a recorded KPS of
2. It is interesting to note that there was no trend across
the decades of age of an increasing proportion of patients
with increased KPS scores. The increase was only noted
among those patients aged 80 years. In this study population, KPS was not found to correlate with the presence
of a medical comorbidity (Table 1). Severity scores for
comorbid conditions were not assessed in this analysis.

brackets except those patients aged >80 years, for whom
combination chemotherapy was used in 69% of patients
(P < .0001) (Table 2).
Standard doses of chemotherapy as previously
defined were used at the initiation of treatment in 69% of
the entire cohort. In an evaluation based on decade of age,
1475

Original Article

approximately 85% of patients aged 70 years were prescribed full-dose combination therapy. Patients ages 70
years to 79 years were prescribed full-dose therapy approximately 72% of the time and this figure decreased dramatically after age 80 years, with only 28% of patients
initiating chemotherapy with standard chemotherapeutic
doses (P < .0001).
Participation in clinical trials was relatively uniform
among patients in each decade of age with the exception
of the group aged 80 years, in whom only 12% of
patients were enrolled on clinical trials compared with
55% to 74% of patients in younger age groups (P <
.00001). These clinical trials included participation in the
following Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols: GOG 0172, a comparison of intravenous paclitaxel
and cisplatin vs intravenous paclitaxel, intraperitoneal cisplatin, and intraperitoneal paclitaxel (March 1998-January 2001); GOG 0182, a comparison of paclitaxel and
carboplatin vs triplet or sequential doublet combination
(January 2001-September 2004); and GOG 0218, a comparison of paclitaxel and carboplatin vs paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab, with or without bevacizumab
consolidation (September 2005 to present), as well as several pharmaceutical trials.9,10
A significant trend toward an increased need for
packed red blood cell transfusion during chemotherapy
was found with increasing age: 29% among those patients
aged <50 years to 55% among those patients aged 80
years (P ¼ .01). The use of epoetin-a did not appear to
follow this trend because usage was fairly uniform across
each decade of age at 17% to 31%. The incidence of neutropenic fever increased with each decade of age from 8%
among those patients aged <50 years to 21% among
those patients aged 80 years, although this did not reach
statistical significance. The use of filgrastim was fairly low
among those patients aged <50 years (8%), but increased
to 21% to 33% in patients aged 50 years. The increase
in the use of filgrastim was fairly uniform across each decade of age, reaching a high among those patients aged
80 years (33%). Treatment delays of at least 1 week
were fairly common across the entire cohort (50%-77%),
with the lowest proportion of delays noted among those
patients aged 80 years. Dose reduction was, again,
found to be similar across all age decades without any statistically significant difference noted by age (27%-33%).
When doublet chemotherapy was used, there was a signif1476

icant difference observed in the proportion of patients
having an agent discontinued during therapy, with only
8% of patients aged <50 years having an agent discontinued compared with 49% of those patients aged 80 years
(P < .0002).
When we evaluated the proportion of patients who
actually completed all 6 cycles of chemotherapy, we found
that between 84% and 97% of patients aged 79 years
achieved this goal whereas only 57% of patients aged 80
years completed all 6 cycles (P < .00001). The reason for
the early discontinuation of therapy among patients in
this age bracket was intolerance of chemotherapy (23%)
or death (20%), both of which occurred significantly
more often among the population aged 80 years.
Chemotherapy Toxicity
The following self-reported toxicities, graded as per CTC
criteria (version 2 or 3), were assessed: fever, fatigue,
vision changes, anorexia, mouth sores, difficulty eating,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, pain, depression, numbness, tingling, and tinnitus. Assessed hematologic toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
and anemia (Table 3).
The toxicity score of interest was grade 3 or 4. The
collected data were analyzed in several ways. The average
toxicity score based on the number of cycles actually
received was evaluated (data not shown), as was the worst
score reported for each toxicity category. No method of
analysis found significant variations in the self-reported
toxicities by age, with the exception of increased nausea
and depression among patients in the youngest age category. When evaluating hematologic toxicities, patients
aged 80 years were less likely to experience grade 3 or 4
neutropenia; however, this is likely a factor in these
patients receiving less chemotherapy than the younger
cohorts. As was noted with regard to the need for transfusions, there was a trend toward increasing grade 3 or 4
anemia among the oldest cohort (4% vs 17%), although
this trend did not reach statistical significance.
Weight loss was evaluated in increments of 2.27
kilograms (kg), 4.6 kg, and 6.82 kg lost during chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with reported weight
loss significantly increased with each advancing age group.
Approximately 40% of patients aged 80 years experienced a weight loss of 4.6 kg during therapy compared

with 8% to 29% of those patients aged <80 years (P ¼
.002). A weight loss of 6.82 kg was reported in 31% of
patients aged 80 years compared with 5% to 17% of
those aged <80 years (P ¼ .03).
Several univariate analyses were run in an attempt to
identify variables that may be used to create a predictive
model for the completion of chemotherapy after surgical
cytoreduction. Variables included in this analysis were the
presence of medical comorbidities, residual disease, need
for initial dose reduction, need for epoetin-a, weight loss
during therapy, initial albumin levels <2 g/dL, creatinine
clearance <65 mL/minute, and neutropenic fever.
Although no differences in self-reported toxicities were
found between groups based on decade of age, further exploration of these toxicities was warranted because of their
potential to affect the completion of treatment. A logistic
regression model revealed the significant predictors of failure to complete 6 cycles of chemotherapy were 5% weight
loss (odds ratio [OR] of 2.5 [95% confidence interval
(95% CI), 1.1-5.5]), prechemotherapy albumin level <2
g/dL (OR of 3.65 [95% CI, 1.4-9.7]), creatinine clearance

DISCUSSION
Cancer is primarily a disease of elderly persons, with
>50% of cases occurring in people aged >65 years.11 As
the proportion of elderly patients aged 80 years continues to increase, so will the number of these patients presenting with malignancies. Women who reach the age of
80 years have an expectation of an additional 9.5 years of
life and many of these patients, despite their advanced
age, will desire aggressive therapy even if it is not
curative.12
The determinants of why elderly patients with ovarian cancer are more frequently prescribed substandard
therapy include the patient’s functional status, medical
comorbidities, nutritional status, psychologic status, and
social support. Because it is difficult and time-consuming
to assess all of these determinants in clinical practice, the
default mode is to assume they are present and will impact
negatively on the patient’s tolerance of chemotherapy,
thereby justifying dose and or treatment modifications.13
1477

Original Article

Data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program
found that patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer
who are aged >75 years underwent combination surgery
and chemotherapy only 20% of the time.14 Patients aged
80 years were found to not only be less likely to undergo
surgery, but any surgery that was performed was more
likely to be suboptimal compared with that performed in
younger patients.15 Chemotherapy is also unevenly used
among the ‘‘oldest old,’’ with reported rates of use ranging
from 46% to 83% in patients aged 75 years with
advanced ovarian malignancies.3,13-17
The current study data illustrate the opposite end of
this spectrum. By our institutional practice standards, the
majority of patients who present aged >80 years with
advanced ovarian cancer have been believed to be surgical
candidates with planned combination chemotherapy to
follow. The finding that only 57% of this population was
able to complete the prescribed chemotherapy after surgery compared with nearly 90% of the younger patient
cohorts would suggest that our baseline assessment of
these elderly patients is flawed and improved treatment
planning algorithms and toxicity assessment are important unmet needs.
In the current study, the baseline factors evaluated
included age, albumin level, creatinine clearance level,
KPS, and the presence of medical comorbidities. Of these,
only an albumin level <2 g/dL and a creatinine clearance
<65 mL/minute were found to be associated with an
inability to complete chemotherapy after cytoreductive
surgery.
Poor nutrition is a known poor prognostic factor for
surgical recovery. However, by the very nature of ovarian
cancer, many if not the majority of patients presenting
with advanced malignancies will have low albumin values
due to ascites production. Once the tumor is removed and
chemotherapy is administered, most patients have
improved nutritional intake and will normalize their
nutritional markers. Because of this, poor nutritional
markers are not traditionally believed to preclude surgical
cytoreduction. Our multivariate model suggests that renal
dysfunction and poor nutrition in combination may identify a person with too little functional reserve to tolerate
chemotherapy after primary surgery and who therefore
requires a modified regimen. The known age-associated
decline in renal mass and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
1478

places elderly patients with ovarian cancer at high risk for
having both these negative prognostic markers and should
be included in future treatment planning algorithms.
Although 17% of patients in the current study aged
80 years were found to have a KPS >2 compared with
0% to 4% in the younger age groups, it was not found to
be a significant predictor of treatment tolerability. Other
evaluative tools such as the Charlson comorbidity index,
Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status,
and Zubrod scale are all widely used measures of patient
status but, similar to KPS, to our knowledge have not
been well-validated in the elderly and are not comprehensive enough to guide treatment management.
Similarly, the presence and number of medical
comorbidities was not found to be associated with a
patient’s ability to complete treatment. This fact is likely
due to a lack of severity analysis of these comorbid conditions. These data, although unavailable due to the retrospective nature of data collection, would be invaluable in a
prospective study of this patient population.
In the current study, the evaluation of how treatment was initiated among those patients aged 80 years
compared with the younger cohorts is informative in that
it suggests that much of the difficulty these elderly patients
encounter in completing chemotherapy may be based on
an inability to recover from surgery. This is demonstrated
by the finding that only 69% of patients aged 80 years
initiated therapy with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with well over 90% of patients in the
younger age cohorts. Even more striking, however, is the
finding that only 28% of patients aged 80 years initiated
therapy with full-dose combination chemotherapy and,
likely because of this, only 12% were eligible for and enrolled on clinical trials. This practice indicates that the
treating physician believed that, at the time of the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient was too frail to receive
full-dose standard therapy. This point is further emphasized by the finding that the strongest predictor of failure
to complete 6 cycles of chemotherapy on multivariate
analysis was the physician’s decision to initiate therapy
with single-agent chemotherapy (OR of 5.3).
Once chemotherapy was initiated, there were continued indications that those in the oldest age group were
struggling, including an increasing need for transfusion
with each advancing decade of age (29%-55%), despite
relatively equivalent use of epoetin-a, and an increase in

the incidence of neutropenic fever with each advancing
decade of age (8%-21%), again despite the similar use of
filgrastim and fewer cases of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
reported among patients aged 80 years. The most important indication of a patient’s inability to tolerate chemotherapy was that, among those patients who did initiate
combination chemotherapy, 49% discontinued treatment
of 1 agent (typically paclitaxel).
The reported hematologic toxicities (grade 3 or 4)
were actually found to be less among those patients aged
80 years compared with younger patient cohorts. This is
likely related in part to the use of filgrastim and epoetin-a
but is in larger part due to the finding that these patients
just received less total chemotherapy and therefore the
incidence of hematologic toxicities was lower.
Nonhematologic toxicities were assessed using CTC
criteria (version 2 or 3). We recognize that this is not a validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure and is traditionally used by the treating physician to assess and score
chemotherapy-related side effects. In our practice, the CTC
is used in this manner but it also reflects PRO to an extent.
Before the prechemotherapy visit, the patient is given a
CTC form to complete (Fig. 1). Each side effect is listed
and each grade is described and the patient is instructed to
circle the side effect and grade she believes best represents
her symptoms. Although this is not a validated PRO measure, our hypothesis was that we would be able to identify
some toxicity signs that differ by age and may indicate what
specific toxicities were driving early treatment discontinuation. Our results, unfortunately, found no such sign to exist.
It is likely that this model of assessing toxicity is not
valid in an elderly population and that it asks the wrong
questions regarding treatment tolerance. An example of
this is found in the responses to queries concerning eating.
Among patients aged >80 years, 40% lost 4.5 kg and
31% lost 6.75 kg during chemotherapy, which was significantly more than that reported in the younger patient
cohorts. Despite this, we found no increase in selfreported loss of appetite, difficulty eating, or nausea and
emesis among the elderly.
Although there was no hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity found to be directly associated with early
chemotherapy discontinuation, the finding that patients
aged 80 years did so frequently come off therapy before
completion is likely correlated to a combination of failure
to recover from primary surgery and chemotherapyCancer

related toxicity. A component of chemotherapy-related
toxicity is entirely plausible given the likelihood that these
patients received an excessive dose (even with dose reduction) due to the almost universal presence of significant
age-related renal dysfunction. There are a variety of formulas for calculating carboplatin dose that use a calculated instead of a measured GFR. These values may
misdose elderly patients because studies have demonstrated a poor correlation between calculated and measured GFR among elderly patients.18

Conclusions
The results of the current study present 3 main concepts
for a future prospective study. First is the concept of the
valid pretreatment assessment of elderly patients. The
patients in the current study were believed to be appropriate surgical candidates by their attending gynecologic
oncologists. The finding that, after surgery, few patients
were recovered enough to receive full-dose combination
chemotherapy argues that primary cytoreduction may
have less of a role in the treatment of ovarian cancer
patients aged 80 years than it does in younger patients
and that validated tools for the assessment of fitness for
surgery are needed.
The second concept is that we do not possess clinically
usable and validated toxicity measures by which we can
identify and assess those toxicities that are most important
in a geriatric population. Again, unless we know what toxicities are driving the early discontinuation of therapy, we cannot design more tolerable treatment regimens.
The third concept is that pharmacokinetic data for
commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in patients aged
80 years do not exist. Given the significant renal
derangements found to be present at baseline in the current study, a better understanding of pharmacokinetics in
this population may assist in more appropriate dosing and
a reduction in related toxicities.
Based on the results of the current study, when treating outwardly fit ovarian cancer patients aged 80 years,
options may include primary cytoreduction with the
planned initiation of single-agent chemotherapy until
functional reserve is restored and the addition of a second
agent may be attempted, or treatment with primary combination chemotherapy and the consideration of interval
surgical cytoreduction based on tumor response and the

patient’s tolerance of therapy. Either or both of these
options should be tested in a prospective manner with
imbedded, validated, patient-reported outcome measures
of key toxicities so that we may learn how best to treat and
monitor this vulnerable population.
