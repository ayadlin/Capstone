Abstract
Cisplatin is one of the most effective anticancer drugs, but its
severe toxic effects, including depletion of immune-competent
cells, limit its efficacy. We combined the systemic treatment
with cisplatin with intratumor delivery of dendritic cells (DC)
previously treated ex vivo with a pulse of nitric oxide (NO)
released by the NO donors (z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2ammonioethyl)amino]-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate or isosorbide
dinitrate. We found that this chemoimmunotherapy, tested in
the B16 mouse model of melanoma, was significantly more
efficacious than cisplatin alone, leading to tumor regression
and animal survival at low doses of cisplatin that alone had no
effect. Tumor cure was not observed when combining cisplatin
with DCs not exposed to NO donors, indicating the key role of
the pretreatment with NO. We investigated the mechanisms
responsible for the synergic effect of NO-treated DCs and
cisplatin and found that NO-treated DCs were protected both
in vitro and in vivo from cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
Cisplatin triggered DC apoptosis through increased expression
and activation of acid sphingomyelinase; pretreatment of DCs
with NO donors prevented such activation and inhibited
activation of the downstream proapoptotic events, including
generation of ceramide, activation of caspases 3 and 9, and
mitochondrial depolarization. The effects of NO were mediated through generation of its physiologic messenger, cyclic
GMP. We conclude that NO and NO generating drugs represent
promising tools to increase the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapies in vivo, promoting the survival and increasing the
function of injected cells by targeting a key pathway in
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7559–64]

Introduction
Delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment
of human cancer is often accompanied by acute and cumulative
toxicities to normal tissues that limit the dose and duration
of treatment. One promising strategy to reduce the toxicity of
chemotherapy maintaining its efficacy is the combination of
chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Such strategy could exploit
the debulking effects of chemotherapy to treat cancers, because

chemotherapy and immunotherapy have different mechanisms of
action (1–3).
Among immunotherapies, approaches based on dendritic cell
(DC) vaccines are particularly promising. These professional
antigen-presenting cells can exploit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of tumor cells to elicit improved antitumor immunity
through the acquisition of tumor-associated antigens from
apoptotic tumor cells; in addition, they have direct cytotoxic
effects on cancer cells (1, 2).
A major limitation for combination chemoimmunotherapy is
that the chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptotic death of
immune competent cells used for immunotherapies (1, 4). This
reduces significantly the efficacy of this kind of treatments. A
strategy that protects selectively DCs, but not tumor cells, from the
cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutics would therefore significantly
enhance the efficacy of combined chemoimmunotherapy, allowing
reduced dosage of the chemotherapeutics to limit their toxic effects
against normal tissues. No strategy to reach this goal, however, has
been envisaged thus far.
To address the issue, we took advantage of the properties of
nitric oxide (NO). NO enhances resistance of DCs to the toxic effect
of the tumor environment in vivo and increases DC cytotoxic,
endocytic, and antigen-presenting functions (5–8). In addition,
NO inhibits activation of the sphingomyelin-hydrolyzing enzyme
acid sphingomyelinase (A-SMase), whose activation triggers
apoptosis in DCs (9). A-SMase is activated by most chemotherapeutics (10, 11).
DCs were exposed to a single pulse of NO ex vivo, using either
isosorbide dinitrate or (z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO), a NO donor that
releases NO constantly at defined concentrations (12). The NO
donor was removed thoroughly before DC injection at the tumor
site to obtain a selective effect on DCs and avoid the in vivo
effects of NO that in the case of tumors are complex and often
conflicting (13, 14). The treatment was tested in vivo on the highly
tumorigenic and poorly immunogenic B16 mouse melanoma in a
combined chemoimmunotherapy with cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloro-platinum), one of the most effective, but also toxic,
anticancer drugs (15). NO-treated DCs significantly enhanced the
therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin so that tumor regression and
animal survival were obtained at doses of cisplatin that were
otherwise ineffective. NO inhibited cisplatin-triggered activation
of A-SMase and generation of the proapoptotic sphingolipid
ceramide in DCs and protected these cells from apoptosis.
Furthermore, NO-treated DCs resisted the toxic effect of the
tumor environment. NO seems, therefore, as a simple strategy to
enhance efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy, by increasing survival
and function of DCs.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Female C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C57BL/6 A-SMase / mice (6–
8 weeks old; ref. 16) were treated in accordance with the European Community guidelines and with the approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee.
Cell culture and characterization. B16-F1 C57BL/6-derived melanoma
cells and DCs from mouse bone marrow precursors were obtained,
cultured, and characterized as described (5, 8, 9). The purity of DCs was in
all experiments no less than 80%. Treatments of DCs with isosorbide
dinitrate, DETA-NO, 8-Br-cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate (cGMP), or
H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) were for 6 h, and the
compounds were then fully removed by washing. After the washout, the
medium did not contain residual bioactive NO because it was unable to
stimulate generation of cGMP in PC12 cells, an extremely sensitive cGMP–
reporter cell system that can detect generation of NO in the low nanomolar
range (ref. 17; Supplementary Materials and Methods). cGMP concentrations in DCs were assessed as described (6).
Intratumoral DC injection. C57BL/6 mice ( five animals per group)
received 1  105 B16-F1 cells (i.e., 10-fold the minimal tumorigenic dose,
determined in previous experiments to be 1  104 cells) s.c. in the lower-right
flank on day 0 (8). Tumors reached the appropriate size (f10 mm2) after
6 days. On days 6 and 9, mice received cisplatin or vehicle (PBS) i.p. and DCs
(1  106) or their vehicle (PBS) were injected i.t. within 1 h from cisplatin
treatment; tumor growth was monitored twice a week by a caliper. Mice were
sacrificed when their tumors reached 15 mm on either diameter. To reveal
injected DCs at tumor site, DCs were previously labeled with 2 Amol/L
fluorescent dye 5-chlormethylfluorescein (CMFDA) for 30 min at 37jC (8).
Tumors were collected 24 and 72 h after DC injection. Single-cell suspensions
were prepared as described (8), decorated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated
anti-CD11c monoclonal antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Measurement of A-SMase activity and expression and ceramide
generation. A-SMase activity was determined by measuring conversion
of sphingomyelin to phosphorylcholine in homogenates of DCs (2  106
cells/mL) treated with cisplatin (10 Ag/mL) as described (9). Western blot
analyses were carried out on 50 Ag of DC lysates (8). Relevant bands were
immunodecorated using rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies specific for
A-SMase (Eurogentech), followed by incubation with horse radish
peroxidase–conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgGs. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure
(Amersham) and quantified by microdensitometry using a Molecular
Dynamics Imagequant apparatus. Ceramide generation was measured by
the diacyl-glycerol kinase assay and revealed by TLC (9).
To detect intracellular A-SMase by flow cytometry, cells were fixed with
paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS for 10 min at room temperature) and then
permeabilized for 20 min at room temperature in PBS supplemented with
1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin. The primary antibody was
detected using a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. An
isotype-matched antibody was used as control (9).
Measurement of variables of apoptosis. Phosphatidylserine exposure
in propidium iodide (PI)–excluding cells was monitored by staining for
15 min at room temperature with FITC-labeled Annexin V (2 Ag/mL).
The mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by flow cytometry in
DCs (1  106 cells per sample) stained with 500 nmol/L of potentialsensitive fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE; ref. 8).
Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities were assessed measuring the cleavage
of the fluorogenic caspase-9 and caspase-3 substrates Ac-LEHD-7-afc and
Ac-DEVD-7-amc with a Perkin-Elmer LS50 fluorometer as described (8).
Statistical analysis. The results are expressed as means F SE; n
represents the number of individual experiments. Statistical analysis was
done using the Student’s t test and the log-rank statistic. All data were
considered statistically significant for P < 0.05. Double and triple asterisks
or crosses in the figures refer to P values of <0.01 and <0.001, respectively.

injected i.t. in the s.c. growing B16 melanomas. A parallel group
of animals received 4-fold the dose of cisplatin (4 mg/kg), but
not DCs. In the groups receiving injection of DETA-NO–treated
DCs, tumor growth was significantly reduced (Fig. 1A) with
respect to that observed in all other groups, including the one
receiving high-dose cisplatin alone. All the animals in the other
groups eventually died because of the tumor, whereas, in the
group receiving DETA-NO-treated DCs, animal survival was
significant (87 F 4%; P < 0.001 versus cisplatin-treated animals
receiving untreated DCs, n = 6; Fig. 1B). In all surviving animals,
tumor regression was observed. The effect of DETA-NO was due
neither to an action of the corresponding amine, DETA, nor to
the stable decomposition product of NO, nitrite, because if the
compound was allowed to decompose fully, it had no effects
(not shown; ref. 12).

The effect of NO on DC intratumor survival in cisplatintreated animals was also evaluated. To this end, DCs were
stained with the dye CMFDA (8) before their injection into
tumors. Tumors were recovered 24 and 72 h after injection, cells
were dispersed and analyzed by flow cytometry after staining
for the DC marker CD11c. Treatment ex vivo of DCs with DETANO resulted in the recovery of significantly higher numbers
of CMFDA+/CD11c+ cells at the tumor site (Fig. 1C). The effect
of DETA-NO pretreatment was persistent, because the yield of
DETA-NO–treated DCs retrieved from tumor site did not change
even when DC injection was delayed for 2 and 4 h after the end
of the treatment with DETA-NO and the removal of the drug
(Fig. 1C). CMFDA /CD11c+ cells accounted for <0.1% of the
recovered cells and did not change significantly with the various
treatments (not shown). Results similar to those of DETA-NO

were observed when the pretreatment was carried out using
isosorbide dinitrate (50 Amol/L) as the NO donor (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Thus, a combined therapy with cisplatin and NO-treated DCs
increases numbers of DCs at tumor site and leads to tumor
regression and animal survival at doses of cisplatin that otherwise
have no therapeutic effects.
NO pretreatment prevents activation of A-SMase by
cisplatin and protects DCs from cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Cisplatin triggers apoptosis of tumor cells through activation of
A-SMase (11). We investigated whether cisplatin triggered this
apoptogenic pathway in DCs and assessed the effect of NO on it.
Cisplatin (10 Ag/mL) induced concentration-dependent increases
in A-SMase activity and ceramide generation and a timedependent increase in A-SMase expression by DCs from wt
animals (wtDCs; Fig. 2A). wtDCs cultured for 8 h in the presence
of cisplatin died via apoptosis, as shown by the exposure on the
outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of phosphatidylserine
assessed by Annexin V staining in PI-excluding cells, by the
decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential assessed by
staining with TMRE, and by the increased activity of caspase-3
and caspase-9 (Fig. 2B and C; ref. 8). By contrast, cisplatin
modified none of the above variables nor induced apoptosis of
DCs obtained from A-SMase null (A-SMase / ) mice (Fig. 2B
and C).
To evaluate the role of NO, wtDCs were treated as described
above in the presence or absence of DETA-NO, isosorbide dinitrate,
the cell permeable analogue of cGMP, 8-Br-cGMP (3 mmol/L),
or DETA-NO combined with ODQ (1 Amol/L), a selective guanylate
cyclase inhibitor that prevents NO-dependent cGMP generation
(6, 8). The NO donors inhibited the increases in expression and
activation of A-SMase and ceramide generation induced by
cisplatin in wtDCs and protected wtDCs from apoptosis as
shown by reduced Annexin V staining, maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3 and
caspase-9 (Fig. 3A–C; Supplementary Fig. S1). Sensitivity to
apoptosis, however, was restored by administration of exogenously added C2 ceramide (10 Amol/L) or A-SMase (2.0 units/mL),
indicating that inhibition of A-SMase accounted for the protective effect of NO. All the effects of NO depended on generation of cGMP because they were mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP and
prevented by ODQ. This was confirmed by the observation that
DCs, although devoid of endogenous NOS isoforms (ref. 9;
Supplementary Fig. S2), are endowed with guanylate cyclase
activity (6, 9) and respond to DETA-NO with generation of
cGMP; values in DETA-NO–treated wtDCs, control, and DETANO plus ODQ-treated wtDCs were 4.39 F 0.11, 0.55 F 0.07, and
0.69 F 0.08 pmol/mg min 1, respectively (P < 0.001 in DETA-NO–
treated cells versus control; n = 4). cGMP generation ceased after
DETA-NO removal, whereas its effects on signaling were long
lasting, as shown by the persistent increase in Bcl-XL (Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with the persistency of the effect of DETANO (Fig. 1C). DETA-NO, 8-Br-cGMP and ODQ had effects neither on
basal A-SMase activity/expression nor on the various variables of
apoptosis measured (not shown).
NO pretreatment prevents activation of A-SMase by
cisplatin and protects DCs from cisplatin-induced apoptosis
in vivo. We evaluated the role of A-SMase activation and its
inhibition by NO on DCs in vivo. To this end, we used untreated
A-SMase / DCs and wtDCs treated with or without DETA-NO
ex vivo. In the groups receiving cisplatin and injection of

pretreated for 6 h in the presence or absence of DETA-NO (10 Amol/L),
8-Br-cGMP (3 mmol/L) or DETA-NO plus ODQ (1 Amol/L). After the removal of
the various compounds, DCs were exposed to cisplatin (10 Ag/mL) with or
without C2 ceramide (10 Amol/L) or exogenously added A-SMase (2.0 units/mL)
for 5 min or 24 h (A), or 12 h (B and C ). A, A-SMase activity and expression.

NO-Treated Dendritic Cells Enhance Cisplatin Efficacy

A-SMase / DCs, tumor growth was significantly reduced (Fig. 4A)
and animal survival and tumor regression were significant
(69 F 3% and 76.2 F 4.23%, respectively, at 30 days; P < 0.001
versus cisplatin-treated animals receiving wtDCs; n = 6; Fig. 4B)
in the range of that observed using DETA-NO–treated wt and
A-SMase / DCs. Moreover, intratumor survival of CMFDA+/
CD11c+ A-SMase / DCs was not significantly different from that
of DETA-NO–treated wtDCs (Fig. 4C). Of importance, no additional
protective effects were observed in DETA-NO–treated versus
untreated A-SMase / DCs.
These results indicate that NO protects DCs from the apoptogenic effect of cisplatin in vivo through inhibition of A-SMase.

Discussion
In this study we show that intratumor delivery of DCs briefly
exposed ex vivo to NO enhances significantly the therapeutic
efficacy of cisplatin. The protocol we used was designed to expose
DCs to NO selectively and only ex vivo to minimize the systemic
effects of NO in vivo. These effects of NO in the case of tumors are
complex, resulting from a combination of cytotoxic and cytostatic
actions on tumor cells, and protumorigenic functions, including
stimulation of angiogenesis and down-regulation of immune
responses (13, 14); in addition, systemic NO may change sensitivity
to anticancer drugs in vivo (18–23).
The combined chemoimmunotherapy with NO-treated DCs and
cisplatin not only specifically and significantly reduced the growth
of the highly tumorigenic and poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma
but also yielded almost 90% animal survival and tumor regression at
doses of the chemotherapeutic that do not have a therapeutic effect
per se. The effect of the combined chemoimmunotherapy is significantly greater than that of NO-treated DCs alone (8) and opens the
way to possible therapeutic strategies that minimize the toxic
effects of the chemotherapeutic while enhancing their efficacy.
The effect of NO seems due to inhibition of the ability of
cisplatin to kill DCs in vivo. The cytotoxic effect of cisplatin is
mediated through A-SMase activation and ceramide generation,
as showed by resistance of A-SMase / DCs to cisplatin-induced
death. Our results clearly show that inhibition of A-SMase is
the mechanism whereby NO increases the numbers of DCs at
tumor site in vivo. A-SMase is activated by most chemotherapeutics (10, 11) and is important in determining tumor
sensitivity/resistance to them (24). The observation that A-SMase
is also the target of the protective action of NO suggests that
the therapeutic efficacy of NO-treated DCs is not restricted to
cisplatin but may conceivably increase the efficacy of most
chemotherapeutics.
Whereas survival at tumor site was similar for NO-treated wtDCs
and untreated A-SMase / DCs, tumor regression and animal
survival were greater with NO-treated DCs than with untreated
A-SMase / DCs; this suggests that other A-SMase–independent
actions of NO on DCs contribute to its antitumor effect. Indeed NO
increases DC cytotoxic action against tumor cells, enhances DCs
antigen-presenting functions, and increases their ability to release
antitumor cytokines, such as IL-12 (5, 6, 8, 25).
The treatment with NO shows two characteristics: (a) it is
persistent, because a brief exposure of DCs yielded long-lasting
antitumor action; (b) it depends on the generation of its physiologic messenger cGMP after activation of guanylate cyclase, an
enzyme known to be activated by nanomolar concentrations of
NO and mediate physiologic actions of the gas. The persistency and

cGMP dependency of the effects of NO are consistent with NO/
cGMP-induced changes in gene expression profile (26), as also
indicated by the persistent increases in Bcl-XL levels and/or
changes in lipid homeostasis (27) that still need to be investigated.
Both persistency and cGMP dependency of the effects of NO are
crucial from a therapeutic standpoint because antitumor action is
obtained with a short-term drug exposure compatible with
minimal manipulation of DCs ex vivo and because the concentrations of NO exerting pharmacologic effects are low. In addition,
because of its simplicity, the treatment might be easily combined
with other strategies of DC manipulation, including loading with
tumor-specific antigens (1), to yield an enhanced therapeutic effect
of combined chemoimmunotherapies.
