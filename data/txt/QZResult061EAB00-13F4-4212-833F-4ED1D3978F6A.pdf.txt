Abstract
Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), the major histologic subtype of RCC accounting for more than 80% of
cases, are typiﬁed by biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Although
accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-a) is the most well-studied effect of VHL inactivation, direct
inhibition of HIFa or restoration of wild-type pVHL protein expression has not proved readily feasible, given the
limitations associated with pharmacologic targeting of transcription factors (i.e., HIF-a) and gene replacement
therapy of tumor suppressor genes (i.e., VHL). Here, we have established that phosphorylated c-Jun, a substrate of
the c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK), is selectively activated in clear cell RCC patient specimens. Using multiple isogenic
cell lines, we show that HIF-a–independent JNK hyperactivation is unique to the pVHL-deﬁcient state.
Importantly, pVHL-deﬁcient RCCs are dependent upon JNK activity for in vitro and in vivo growth. A multistep
signaling pathway that links pVHL loss to JNK activation involves the formation of a CARD9/BCL10/TRAF6
complex as a proximal signal to sequentially stimulate TAK1 (MAPKKK), MKK4 (MAPKK), and JNK (MAPK). JNK
stimulates c-Jun phosphorylation, activation, and dimerization with c-Fos to form a transcriptionally competent
AP1 complex that drives transcription of the Twist gene and induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Thus,
JNK represents a novel molecular target that is selectively activated in and drives the growth of pVHL-deﬁcient
clear cell RCCs. These ﬁndings can serve as the preclinical foundation for directed efforts to characterize potent
pharmacologic inhibitors of the JNK pathway for clinical translation. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1374–85. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The protein product of the VHL gene, pVHL, serves many
functions, the most well-characterized of which relate to its
role in the E3 ligase complex that polyubiquitinates the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-a), thereby marking it for proteasome-mediated degradation (1). In this
capacity, pVHL plays a central role in mammalian cellular
responses to ambient oxygen tension. Biallelic inactivation of
the VHL gene characterizes both hereditary and sporadic forms
of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Approximately 90% of
clear cell RCCs manifest biallelic VHL inactivation through
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, whereas nonclear cell
RCC variants such as papillary and chromophobe RCCs are

devoid of VHL gene alterations and express wild-type pVHL (2).
Reexpression of pVHL suppresses tumor formation in pVHLdeﬁcient murine models (3), and HIF-a expression is required
for tumorigenesis in the context of pVHL deﬁciency (4, 5).
Thus, there is a preclinical rationale for drug development
aimed at inhibition of the pVHL–HIFa interaction. Unfortunately, efﬁcient and selective restoration of the VHL gene in
tumor cells of actual patients is not achievable with current
gene therapy technologies, and transcription factors such as
HIF-a are not readily amenable to drug development. Therefore, despite the etiologic role of the pVHL–HIFa relationship
in renal carcinogenesis, alternative strategies aimed at targeting more traditional "druggable" targets are required.
In the case of clear cell RCC, proto-oncoproteins that are
negatively regulated by pVHL may recapitulate the state of
nononcogene addiction under the conditions of biallelic VHL
inactivation. That is, the identiﬁcation of biochemical signals,
especially "druggable" kinases that are activated in response to
VHL loss in a HIF-a–independent fashion could provide alternative opportunities for therapeutic development. Indeed,
there is evidence for the existence of HIF-a–independent
effects of pVHL. For example, pVHL regulates an inhibitory
phosphorylation of caspase recruitment domain 9 protein
(CARD9) by CK2 and downregulates activated PKC activity
(6, 7). Important genotype–phenotype correlations in the
subtypes of von Hippel–Lindau syndrome provide further
evidence for HIF-a–independent effects of pVHL. In type 2C
von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, the associated VHL mutations

JNK/AP1 Activation in pVHL-Deﬁcient RCCs

do not lead to HIF-a dysregulation, yet patients develop
pheochromocytomas (8). Thus, biochemical and clinical correlative evidence points to the existence of HIF-a–independent
effects of pVHL that are germane to oncogenesis.
The c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) is a mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) required for Ras-induced transformation (9). It
is protumorigenic in many tumor model systems. Its effects are
principally mediated through phosphorylation of members of
the AP1 family of transcription factors, such as c-Jun (10). JNK
shares common upstream activators with components of the
classical NF-kB pathway, which is constitutively activated in
VHL-inactivated clear cell RCC in an HIF-a–independent
manner. Accordingly, we investigated the potential for JNK to
function in a nononcogene addiction fashion in the context of
pVHL deﬁciency.

stain. The accuracy of thresholding was veriﬁed by a licensed
pathologist before analysis. For assessing nuclear staining,
positive 3,30 -diaminobenzidine staining was calculated by
applying 2 color thresholds with one recognizing blue background (hematoxylin stained) cells and another recognizing
brown-positive cells and blue, nonpositive cells (total cell
number). Individual cells were discriminated by incorporating
the shape and size thresholds, providing, together with the
color thresholds, actual cell counts. Percent of positivity was
determined by dividing the cell number detected by the brown
threshold by the total cell number, detected by the sum of the
brown and blue thresholds. Total tissue area analyzed was also
included in the ﬁnal analysis. All investigations involving
human specimens were carried out in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Materials and Methods

Cell growth assay
The MTT assay was conducted as described (17).

Reagents
The isogenic pairs of ACHN, SN12C, 786-0, UOK121, and
UMRC6 cell lines have been described (11, 12). The ACHN and
SN12C isogenic pairs were obtained from George Thomas
(Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) and were
tested for pVHL and HIF-a expression by Western blotting
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The 786-0 cell lines were obtained
from W. Kaelin (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA);
UOK121 cells were from J. Gnarra (Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, LA); and UMRC6 cells were from B. Zbar
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The 786-0, UOK121,
and UMRC6 isogenic pairs of cell lines were originally tested for
pVHL and HIF-a expression by Western blotting as described
earlier and are retested quarterly (12). The TRAF6-DN was used
as described (13). Lentiviral plasmids designed to express
target-speciﬁc or non-silencing (NS) short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
were obtained from Open Biosystems, as was the Twist lentiviral
plasmid. Transduction of a pVHL-resistant HIF-1a mutant
(P402A;P564A) or HIF-2a mutant (P405A;P531A) expressed in
the pBabe retrovirus was used to express HIF-a in VHLþ cells
(14, 15). The pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter for normalization of transfection efﬁciency and the ﬁreﬂy luciferase
reporter (pGL4.24) for cloning segments of the Twist promoter
were from Promega. The JNK inhibitor, SP600125, was from
EMD Biosciences, and the TAK1 inhibitor, (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol,
was from Tocris Bioscience. Wild-type and phospho-deﬁcient
myc-tagged CARD9 plasmids were from Addgene, deposited
by W. Kaelin, and have been described earlier (6). The HAubiquitin, HA-ubiquitin-K63, and HA-ubiquitin K48 plasmids
were also from Addgene and deposited by Ted Dawson, Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.
Immunohistochemistry and image analysis
P-c-Jun immunohistochemistry was conducted as described
(16). To quantitate p-c-Jun staining in human nephrectomy
specimens, slides were analyzed using the Ariol SL-50 automated slide scanner (Applied Imaging) for each area of interest.
Thresholds for each image were applied using the Ariol analytical software based on multiple parameters: RGB algorithm,
shape, and size. All analyses were conducted with the MultiStain script. Thresholded classiﬁers were customized for each

Results
Activation of c-Jun in human clear cell RCC specimens
We ﬁrst assessed the state of JNK/AP1 activation in the
context of pVHL deﬁciency in human tissue by examining the
extent of c-Jun phosphorylation by immunohistochemical
staining in clear cell versus nonclear cell RCC radical nephrectomy specimens. Here, we used a phospho-speciﬁc antibody
that detects c-Jun when phosphorylated at serine 73, a residue
that is a substrate for JNK phosphorylation and thus is marker
for JNK activity (18–20). Quantitative assessment by image
analysis conﬁrmed that the percentage of cells exhibiting nuclear p-c-Jun staining was statistically signiﬁcantly greater (P ¼
7.2  1023) in clear cell RCCs than in the nonclear cell
counterparts (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Table S1).
The marked difference in p-c-Jun staining was preserved when
results for clear cell RCCs were compared with individual
histologic subtypes of nonclear cell renal neoplasms (Fig. 1B).
VHL Inactivation results in JNK/AP1 activation
We compared the activation state of the JNK/AP1 signaling
axis in pVHL-replete versus pVHL-deﬁcient RCC cell models.
We employed 2 groups of isogenic pairs of RCC cell lines. In one
group of RCC cell lines (786-0, UOK121, and UMRC6), the
parental cell line manifests biallelic VHL gene inactivation
(VHL), and pVHL expression is restored in the isogenic
counterparts (VHLþ) by stable transduction of a retrovirus
expressing the wild-type VHL gene. These isogenic pairs of RCC
cell lines, and their baseline expression levels of pVHL and HIFa have been widely reported (12, 15). In the second set (ACHN
and SN12C), the parental cell line expresses endogenous wildtype VHL (VHLþ). Isogenic partners that are pVHL-deﬁcient
(VHLlow) have been created by stable transduction of VHLspeciﬁc shRNA, as described (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 14).
Compared with VHLþ cells, all pVHL-deﬁcient cell lines (5/5)
manifested heightened constitutive JNK/AP1 activity by

JNK/AP1 Activation in pVHL-Deﬁcient RCCs

of functionally active pVHL-resistant mutants of HIF-2a in
786-0-VHLþ and HIF-1a in ACHN-VHLþ cells did not induce
JNK activation (Fig. 2A; refs. 14, 15). Moreover, HIF-1a or HIF2a suppression with HIF-a–speciﬁc siRNA did not reduce p-cJun (Ser73) levels in pVHL-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 2B). Conversely,
RNAi of c-Jun did not inﬂuence HIF-1a or HIF-2a expression
(Fig. 2C). Pharmacologic inhibition of JNK with SP600125
(hereafter termed JNKi), did not affect endogenous HIF-1a or
HIF-2a expression, in pVHL-deﬁcient UMRC6 or UOK121 and
786-0 cells, respectively, but did reduce JNK activity and p-c-Jun
levels (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S2A). These ﬁndings
implicate pVHL-dependent, HIF-a–independent biochemical
signaling events in the JNK/AP1 activation that occurs in the
context of pVHL deﬁciency.
In addition to the effects of the JNKi on p-c-Jun levels
described above (Supplementary Fig. S2A), RNA interference
(RNAi) of JNK by transduction of a lentivirus expressing JNKspeciﬁc shRNA also markedly reduced c-Jun Ser73 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S2B), and the JNKi reduced AP1
reporter activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). These results conﬁrm that JNK is the operative MAPK
that regulates c-Jun and AP1 activity in our pVHL-deﬁcient
models.

(4-hour drug exposure) inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun in a dosedependent fashion but does not inﬂuence expression of HIF-1a or HIF-2a
in pVHL-deﬁcient cells.

In vitro and in vivo growth of pVHL-deﬁcient cells is
dependent upon constitutive JNK activity
We next explored the biologic signiﬁcance of JNK hyperactivation on in vitro and in vivo growth. The JNKi inhibited the
growth of pVHL-deﬁcient but not VHLþ cells in vitro in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A). ACHN-VHLlow xenografts, which
exhibited heightened expression of phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig.
3B, top), grew more rapidly than the VHLþ counterparts in
nude mice (Fig. 3B, bottom). Inhibition of JNK expression by
transduction of lentivirus expressing JNK-speciﬁc shRNA
largely abrogated the heightened tumorigenesis observed in
pVHL-deﬁcient ACHN cells. In a similar fashion, the JNKi
prevented the growth of pVHL-deﬁcient ACHN cells (Fig. 3D).
Next, we conﬁrmed the role of JNK in the tumorigenesis of
UOK-121 cells, which manifest endogenous VHL inactivation
and exhibit intrinsically more delayed and slower tumorigenesis (3–5). Approximately 7 to 8 weeks after tumor cell inoculation to allow for the formation of established tumors, mice
harboring subcutaneous UOK121-VHL xenografts were treated with the JNKi or vehicle control. Pharmacologic JNK
inhibition prevented the further growth and actually induced
regression of established pVHL-deﬁcient UOK121 xenografts
(Fig. 3E).
Identiﬁcation of MKK4 and TAK1 as the MAPKK and
MAPKKK, respectively, that drive JNK activity in pVHLdeﬁcient RCC cells
JNK activation is regulated by the MAPKKs, MKK4, and/or
MKK7 (21, 22). MKK7 activation status, as determined by
phosphorylation of MKK7, was similar between pVHL-deﬁcient and pVHL-expressing cell lines (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
phospho-MKK4 expression was increased in pVHL-deﬁcient
cell lines (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of endogenous MKK4 activity by
ectopic expression of a dominant negative MKK4 construct
suppressed AP1 activity (Fig. 4B), a ﬁnding that implicates
MKK4 as the essential MAPKK in this pathway.
A major branch point in the upstream activation of the JNK
signaling axis occurs at the level of the MAPKKKs, including
MEKK1, ASK1, MLK, and others (10). We focused on TGF-b
activating kinase-1 (TAK1), a MAPKKK that not only can
function in the JNK pathway but also operates in the NF-kB
pathway, which has been previously linked to VHL inactivation
(6, 12, 15, 23). Indeed, elevated constitutive TAK1 activation, as
measured by TAK1 in vitro kinase assays and phosphorylated
TAK1 levels, was observed in all (5/5) pVHL-deﬁcient cell lines
(Fig. 4C and D). Exposure of pVHL-deﬁcient cells to a pharmacologic TAK1 inhibitor (TAK1i), (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol, reduced
pMKK4 levels (Fig. 4E), inhibited JNK activity (Fig. 4F), and
reduced AP1 reporter activity (Fig. 4H). In addition, TAK1speciﬁc shRNA inhibited JNK activity, (Fig. 4G). Taken together, these results identify TAK1 ! MKK4 ! JNK ! c-Jun as a
MAPK signaling cascade that is activated in response to VHL
inactivation.

is constitutive activation of CARD9, an upstream trigger for NFkB activation (6). Upon activation, CARD9 typically forms a

that classically result in proteasome-dependent degradation,
is a proteasome-independent, activating event. Importantly,

activated TRAFs recruit and activate TAK1 (in complex with
the adaptor proteins TAB1/2). Thus, we postulated that VHL
inactivation is linked to TAK1 through disinhibition of CARD9
followed by a CARD9- and TRAF-dependent activation and
recruitment of TAK1.
We initially evaluated the ubiquitination state of TRAF6,
which is known to function upstream of TAK1 (25). pVHLdeﬁcient cells showed appreciably more constitutive TRAF6
ubiquitination (Fig. 5A); the TRAF6 polyubiquitination was
mediated through K63 linkages (Fig. 5B). Transient transfection of a TRAF6-dominant negative resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in AP1-driven reporter gene expression in
pVHL-deﬁcient cells, a ﬁnding that mechanistically links
TRAF6 to the JNK/AP1 pathway (Fig. 5C).
Next, we postulated that CARD9–TRAF6 interactions form
more robustly in pVHL-deﬁcient cells. Indeed, appreciably
higher amounts of CARD9 coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6
in all pVHL-deﬁcient cells compared with their VHLþ counterparts (Fig. 5D, top) despite the fact that VHLþ cells constitutively express higher levels of CARD9 (Fig. 5D, bottom). TRAFs
deliver their downstream signals in the context of protein
complexes that contain not only CARD9 but also other modulatory proteins, such as BCL10. In fact, in pVHL-deﬁcient cells,
more BCL10 coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6 compared

www.aacrjournals.org

with VHLþ cells (Fig. 5D, top), yet BCL10 expression did not
vary in a pVHL-dependent fashion (Fig. 5D, bottom).
These biochemical ﬁndings suggested to us that mitigation
of the inhibitory phosphorylation of CARD9 by CK2 in the
context of VHL inactivation, allows for the formation of a
complex that includes CARD9, BCL10, and TRAF6, which
serves as a proximal signal for TAK1 and ultimately JNK/AP1
activation. To directly test this notion, we transfected cells that
endogenously express wild-type pVHL (ACHN and SN12C)
with a wild-type myc-tagged CARD9 construct or a phospho-deﬁcient mutant of the CARD9 construct in which all
CK2 phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine, and is thus
resistant to the CK2-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation. As
predicted, the phospho-deﬁcient CARD9 mutant more readily
coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6 (Fig. 5E), indicating that
the phosphorylation of CARD9 by CK2 functions to inhibit the
formation of a CARD9–TRAF6 complex.
To determine whether the CARD9–TRAF6 interaction drives
the activation of the JNK signaling axis in a pVHL-deﬁcient
context, we conducted RNA interference of CARD9 and examined the downstream effects on TRAF6 K63 polyubiquitination
and TAK1 activation. CARD9 silencing led to a sharp reduction
in TRAF6 K63 polyubiquitination in pVHL-deﬁcient cells (Fig.
5F and G) and inhibited AP1 reporter activity as well as TAK1

kinase activity (Fig. 5H and Supplementary Fig. S3). In summary, the results of our biochemical studies along with previously published work indicate that pVHL deﬁciency results in
the disinhibition of CARD9 (6), formation of a protein complex
amongst CARD9, BCL10, and TRAF6, and activation of TRAF6
through K63 polyubiquitination, which triggers the sequential
activation of TAK1, MKK4, and JNK (Fig. 5I).

JNK/AP1 Induces an EMT phenotype mediated by Twist
We previously reported differences in cellular morphology
between VHLþ and VHLlow ACHN and SN12C cells (14).
Whereas VHLþ cells grew in cellular clusters with individual
cells taking on a polygonal shape, VHLlow cells often grew as
single cells that manifested an elongated, ﬁbroblastic morphology consistent with an epithelial–mesenchymal transition

JNK/AP1 Activation in pVHL-Deﬁcient RCCs

(EMT; Fig. 6A). As reported (14), VHLlow cells also manifested a
"cadherin switch," whereby the characteristic pattern of
increased E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin expression typiﬁed by epithelial cells and observed in VHLþ cells transitioned
to a mesenchymal pattern of heightened N-cadherin and
suppressed E-cadherin expression (Fig. 6B and Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Moreover, compared with VHLþ cells, pVHL-deﬁcient cells showed markedly heightened invasiveness in a
Matrigel chamber, a ﬁnding that further supports the notion
of EMT induced by pVHL deﬁciency (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S4B) that has been described (26–28). Although these
prior studies have implicated HIF-a as a pivotal factor in the
EMT observed in pVHL-deﬁcient RCCs, we investigated the
potential for JNK/AP1 to function in a parallel pathway to
mediate EMT in this context.
RNAi with c-Jun–speciﬁc siRNA reversed the mesenchymal cadherin expression pattern in VHLlow cells (Fig. 6D).
Similar effects on cadherin expression were observed when
JNK-speciﬁc shRNA was introduced (Fig. 6E). In pVHLdeﬁcient cells, the JNKi induced a dose- and time-dependent
reversion of the "cadherin switch" back to that of VHLþ cells
(Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S5). Similarly, the heightened invasiveness of pVHL-deﬁcient cells was reversed by
the JNKi as well as c-Jun–speciﬁc siRNA (Fig. 6G and H and
Supplementary Fig. S6); the JNKi did not inﬂuence the
invasiveness of VHLþ cells (not shown). JNK inhibition did
not result in a reversion of the morphology of pVHL-deﬁcient cells from a mesenchymal to epithelial phenotype, a
ﬁnding that implicates JNK-independent effects on cellular
morphology.
We screened for differential expression of transcription
factors, including Twist, Slug, Snail, Zeb1, and Zeb2, which
are known to regulate EMT and E-cadherin expression (29–31).
Twist and Slug expression was augmented in pVHL-deﬁcient
cells compared with their VHLþ counterparts (Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S4), whereas the expression of Zeb1, Zeb2,
and Snail was unaffected by VHL status (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S4). RNAi of c-Jun sharply decreased the augmentation of Twist expression in VHLlow cells but had no effect
on Slug or Snail expression (Fig. 6D). In the same manner, the
JNKi reduced Twist, but not Slug or Snail expression, in both a
dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 6F and Supplementary
Fig. S5), as did lentiviral-mediated introduction of JNK-speciﬁc
shRNA (Fig. 6E).
Suppression of Twist expression by Twist siRNA reduced the
invasiveness of pVHL-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 7A and B). Ectopic
Twist expression driven by the AP1-independent CMV promoter in pVHL-deﬁcient cells was sufﬁcient to overcome the
inhibitory effects of the JNKi on invasion and E-cadherin
expression (Fig. 7C and D). Taken together, these ﬁndings

indicate that the mesenchymal phenotype of pVHL-deﬁcient
cells is dependent upon JNK-induced Twist expression,
although JNK-independent pathways mediated by HIF-a have
also been described and may be operative (26–28).
c-Jun/c-Fos Heterodimers transactivate Twist through
an upstream AP1 cis-acting element
We next investigated the transcriptional regulation of Twist
expression by AP1. A virtual analysis of the 2.5 kb region
upstream of the Twist transcription start site identiﬁed numerous potential AP1 binding sites with varying degrees of homology to the consensus AP1 sequence (Fig. 7E and Supplementary
Table S2). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiments, we identiﬁed a 350 bp region (2,589–2,238
relative to the transcription start site), hereafter termed the
set 1 segment, that contains 4 predicted AP1 binding sites to
which c-Jun was recruited (Fig. 7F). On the basis of the EMSSAs
shown in Fig. 1F, we predicted that c-Jun forms heterodimers
with c-Fos on the AP1 DNA binding sites of the Twist promoter.
Indeed, ChIP experiments conﬁrmed that c-Fos was recruited
to the set 1 region of the Twist promoter in a similar manner as
c-Jun (Fig. 7F).
To determine whether the set 1 region manifests functional
activity, we cloned the set 1 region into a ﬁreﬂy luciferase
reporter construct. Increased reporter gene activity driven by
the set 1 segment of the Twist promoter was observed in
VHLlow compared with VHLþ cells (Fig. 7G). In contrast, a
similarly sized segment of the Twist promoter, which did
not show AP1 binding in ChIP assays (set 3, Fig. 7E), had
shown similar reporter gene activity in VHLlow and VHLþ cells
(Fig. 7G). Differential reporter gene activity attributable to
the set 1 segment was inhibited by exposure of VHLlow cells
to the JNKi (Fig. 7H). Taken together, our results indicate
that an AP1 complex, composed of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers,
binds to AP1 response elements in the regulatory region
upstream of the Twist promoter, thereby driving Twist protein
expression.

Discussion
We have provided several lines of evidence that pVHL
deﬁciency causally results in JNK activation, whereby the
inhibitory phosphorylation of CARD9 by CK2 is hindered by
the inactivation of VHL (6), CARD9 forms a complex with
TRAF6 and BCL10, resulting in TRAF 6 activation followed in
sequence by TAK1, MKK4, and JNK activation. Importantly,
tumorigenesis of pVHL-deﬁcient RCCs is dependent upon JNK,
which may represent a suitable biochemical target for drug
discovery efforts. The ﬁnding of frequent expression of nuclear
p-c-Jun, a substrate of JNK, in clear cell RCCs further validates
JNK as a target for clinical translation.

We and others have observed that VHL inactivation can
induce a mesenchymal phenotype (14, 26–28). In the process of
elucidating the molecular underpinnings that drive EMT in
pVHL-deﬁcient RCCs, we found that JNK/AP1 induces Twist
transcription. Speciﬁcally, AP1 complexes composed of c-Jun
and c-Fos heterodimers transcriptionally upregulate Twist
expression by directly binding to and transactivating AP1
cis-acting elements upstream of the transcription start site of
the Twist gene. To our knowledge, JNK/AP1 has not been
previously reported to regulate expression of Twist. As a
consequence of increased Twist expression, pVHL-deﬁcient
cells manifest reduced E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin
expression as well as other characteristics of EMT, including
increased invasiveness and a ﬁbroblastic morphology.
Previous reports have found that EMT and reduced Ecadherin expression in pVHL-deﬁcient cells occurs in an
HIF-a–dependent manner (26–28). For example, one group
found that HIF-1a induces Twist protein expression by binding
to hypoxia response elements in the Twist promoter (32). Some
reports speciﬁcally indicted HIF-1a as the principal mediator
of EMT (28), others point to HIF-2a (27), whereas HIF-1a and
HIF-2a were found to function in this regard by yet others (26).
No clear explanation for these discrepancies can be readily
discerned from the methodologies in these studies, although
some of the differential results may be partially accounted for
by the use of different cell lines. Nonetheless, our results that
EMT regulatory transcription factors and EMT itself are regulated in a JNK/AP1-dependent fashion are not mutually
exclusive with HIF-a–dependent regulation of these same
processes. In point of fact, it seems that HIF-a as well as JNK
can both transcriptionally upregulate the expression of transcription factors that mediate EMT, which supports the notion
that JNK and HIF-a function in parallel to coordinately drive
RCC growth and tumorigenesis.
On the basis of the ﬁnding of somatic VHL allele inactivation
observed in the premalignant renal cysts of patients with von
Hippel–Lindau syndrome, the biallelic inactivation of -VHL is
thought to represent an early mutational event in renal carcinogenesis (33, 34). Accordingly, we postulate that not only
constitutive HIF-a expression but also JNK activation represents an early molecular event that occurs in response to VHL
inactivation. Additional acquired genetic lesions, which have

only been partially identiﬁed and elucidated but include mutations in genes that regulate chromatin remodeling and structure, accumulate and are required to initiate RCC (35, 36).
In summary, we have presented several lines of evidence that
JNK/AP1 is constitutively activated in the pVHL-deﬁcient
state. pVHL deﬁciency leads to dependence on the activity of
nonmutated JNK for proliferation and tumorigenesis in a state
of nononcogene addiction. This dependence of clear cell RCCs
on the kinase activity of JNK can potentially be exploited for
clinical translation. Thus, JNK/AP1 hyperactivation may represent a nononcogene addiction target, and further optimization of commercially available JNK inhibitors may constitute a
viable endeavor for clinical application to the treatment of
clear cell RCC.
