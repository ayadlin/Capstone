Abstract
c-FLIP is an inhibitor of apoptosis mediated by the death
receptors Fas, DR4, and DR5 and is expressed as long (c-FLIPL)
and short (c-FLIPS) splice forms. We found that small
interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of c-FLIP induced
spontaneous apoptosis in a panel of p53 wild-type, mutant,
and null colorectal cancer cell lines and that this apoptosis
was mediated by caspase-8 and Fas-associated death domain.
Further analyses indicated the involvement of DR5 and/or
Fas (but not DR4) in regulating apoptosis induced by c-FLIP
siRNA. Interestingly, these effects were not dependent on
activation of DR5 or Fas by their ligands tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand and FasL. Overexpression of c-FLIPL, but not c-FLIPS, significantly decreased
spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in HCT116
cells. Further analyses with splice form–specific siRNAs
indicated that c-FLIPL was the more important splice form
in regulating apoptosis in HCT116, H630, and LoVo cells,
although specific knockdown of c-FLIPS induced more
apoptosis in the HT29 cell line. Importantly, intratumoral
delivery of c-FLIP–targeted siRNA duplexes induced apoptosis
and inhibited the growth of HCT116 xenografts in BALB/c
severe combined immunodeficient mice. In addition, the
growth of c-FLIPL–overexpressing colorectal cancer xenografts was more rapid than control xenografts, an effect that
was significantly enhanced in the presence of chemotherapy.
These results indicate that c-FLIP inhibits spontaneous death
ligand–independent, death receptor–mediated apoptosis in
colorectal cancer cells and that targeting c-FLIP may have
therapeutic potential for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Introduction
Death receptors, such as Fas, and the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR4
(TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2) trigger death signals when bound
by their natural ligands (1, 2). Ligand binding to the death receptors
leads to recruitment of the adaptor protein Fas-associated death
domain (FADD), which in turn recruits caspase-8 (FADD-like
interleukin-1h–converting enzyme) to form death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs; refs. 3, 4). Caspase-8 molecules become
activated at DISCs and subsequently activate proapoptotic
downstream molecules. A key inhibitor of death receptor signaling
is c-FLIP (5). Differential splicing gives rise to long (c-FLIPL) and

short (c-FLIPS) forms of c-FLIP, both of which bind to FADD within
the DISC and inhibit caspase-8 activation. Significantly, c-FLIPL has
been found to be overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinomas
compared with matched normal tissue, suggesting that c-FLIPL may
contribute to tumor transformation in vivo (6).
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of c-FLIP in
regulating the viability of colorectal cancer cells and to investigate
the mechanisms by which it exerts its effects. We have found that
c-FLIP regulates spontaneous death receptor–mediated cell death
in vitro and in vivo and that these effects do not depend on
receptor ligation. Collectively, our results suggest that c-FLIP is a
promising therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. The caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk was purchased from
Calbiochem. Anti-TRAIL neutralizing antibody was obtained from R&D
Systems, and anti-Fas ligand (FasL) antibody was obtained from
PharMingen BD Biosciences.
Cell culture. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37jC. H630 and
HT29 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum
supplemented with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and
50 Ag/mL penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). LoVo
cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 50 Ag/mL penicillin/
streptomycin. HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53 / isogenic human colorectal
cancer cells were kindly provided by Professor Bert Vogelstein (John
Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Both HCT116 cell lines were grown
in McCoy’s 5A medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
dialyzed FCS, 50 Ag/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.
Generation of c-FLIP–overexpressing cell lines. c-FLIPL – and
c-FLIPS –overexpressing cell lines were generated as described previously (7).
Western blotting. Western blots were done as described previously (8).
Caspase-8 (Alexis), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; eBioscience),
and c-FLIP (NF-6; Alexis) mouse monoclonal antibodies were used in
conjunction with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated sheep anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Amersham). Equal loading was assessed using a
h-tubulin mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Sigma).
Flow cytometry. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry by
evaluating the percentage of cells with DNA content <2N as described
previously (7). Cell surface expression of Fas and DR5 was carried out as
described previously (7). Each flow cytometry experiment was carried out at
least thrice. Representative results are presented.
Small interfering RNA transfections. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
were designed to down-regulate either both c-FLIP splice variants (referred
to as FT#1) or to specifically target the long form or the short form as
described previously (7). The additional c-FLIP–targeted sequences
analyzed were the following: FT#2, AAGATAAGCAAGGAGAAGAGT and
FT#3, AACTGCTCTACAGAGTGAGGC. The non–silencing control siRNA
and caspase-8–targeted, Fas-targeted, and DR5-targeted siRNAs were the
same as those described previously (7). FADD-, TRAIL-, and FasL-targeted
siRNAs were obtained commercially (Qiagen). siRNAs for in vitro
transfection were obtained from Dharmacon. Modified (Stealth) siRNAs
based on the c-FLIP–targeted, long form, and scrambled control sequences

were obtained from Invitrogen, Life Technologies. siRNA transfections were
done as described previously (7).
Animal model experiments. Female BALB/c severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were maintained under sterile and controlled
environmental conditions (22jC, 50 F 10% relative humidity, 12-h light/
12-h dark cycle, autoclaved bedding), with food and water ad libitum.
Following a minimum of 1 week of quarantine, mice were included in the
protocols. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. To calculate tumor measurement, two
axes of the tumors were measured using digital Vernier calipers. Tumor
volumes were determined by the following formula: shortest tumor
diameter2  longest tumor diameter  0.5. Mice were implanted s.c. on
each flank with 2  106 HCT116p53+/+ cells using Matrigel. Tumors were
allowed to grow until they reached approximately 50 to 100 mm3, at which
point 1,000 pmol of Stealth modified (Invitrogen) scrambled control
(SCstealth), c-FLIP–targeted (FTstealth), or c-FLIPL–specific (FLstealth) siRNA
were injected intratumorally using a 29-gauge insulin syringe (Kendall, Tyco
Healthcare). The siRNAs were diluted in Opti-MEM medium and complexed
with LipofectAMINE 2000. For analysis of the effect of c-FLIPL overexpression, parental HCT116p53+/+ and FL17 cells were s.c. implanted using
Matrigel; HCT116p53+/+ parental cells were inoculated in the right flank and
FL17 cells were inoculated in the left flank. Tumors were allowed to grow
until they reached f50 mm3 (day 6), at which point the first group received
no treatment and the second group received chemotherapy [5-fluorouracil
(5-FU; 15 mg/kg), days 6–10 and 12–16, qd; oxaliplatin (2 mg/kg), days 6
and 12]. Harvested tumors were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. To extract
protein, xenografts were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer on ice.

Results
c-FLIP gene silencing induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer
cells. We designed several c-FLIP–targeted siRNA duplexes FT#1,
FT#2, and FT#3 to simultaneously target both major splice forms of

c-FLIP. Western blot analyses indicated that FT#1 and FT#2
efficiently silenced c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS expression, whereas FT#3
had no effect on c-FLIP expression (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the
siRNAs that silenced c-FLIP expression also induced significant
levels of PARP cleavage, indicating activation of apoptosis. FT#1
was taken forward for further characterization. c-FLIPL and
c-FLIPS protein expression were down-regulated as early as 8 h
after c-FLIP–targeted siRNA transfection (data not shown) in
agreement with previous findings, which indicated that c-FLIP has
a relatively short half-life (9). Further experiments indicated that
c-FLIP expression was knocked down by concentrations of c-FLIP–
targeted siRNA as low as 0.5 nmol/L, and this correlated with the
onset of apoptosis as assessed by PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B). Both
splice forms of c-FLIP were expressed in a panel of colorectal
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometry experiments indicated
that c-FLIP knockdown resulted in a dramatic increase in the
numbers of HCT116p53+/+ cells in the apoptotic sub-G0-G1 fraction
(Fig. 1D). A similar effect was observed in the p53-null daughter
HCT116 cell line, HCT116p53 / , although the extent of apoptosis
was less than in the p53 wild-type cell line (Fig. 1D). c-FLIP–
targeted siRNA also significantly induced apoptosis in p53 wildtype LoVo colorectal cancer cells and in p53 mutant H630 and
HT29 colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, cell viability
assays showed that transfection with c-FLIP–targeted siRNA
decreased colorectal cancer cell viability as determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (data
not shown). These results indicate that c-FLIP is an important
determinant of colorectal cancer cell viability regardless of p53
status.
The effects of c-FLIP silencing on apoptosis are caspase-8
dependent. We next assessed whether the effects of knocking

down c-FLIP expression on apoptosis were a result of enhanced
death receptor signaling. Firstly, we assessed activation of caspase-8
in cells transfected with c-FLIP–targeted siRNAs. Transfection of
FT#1 and FT#2 into HCT116 cells induced caspase-8 activation as
indicated by the appearance of the p41/43-intermediate forms and
the p18-active subunit, whereas FT#3 and the scrambled control,
which failed to down-regulate c-FLIP, also failed to activate
caspase-8 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, caspase-8 activation correlated
with c-FLIP down-regulation in dose response experiments
(Fig. 1B). The requirement for caspase-8 in apoptosis induced
following c-FLIP gene silencing was directly assessed using a
caspase-8–targeted siRNA. The caspase-8–targeted siRNA potently
down-regulated procaspase-8 expression and attenuated apoptosis
induced by c-FLIP–targeted siRNA in each cell line (Fig. 2A).
Similar results were obtained with the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETDfmk (data not shown). These results indicate that activation of
caspase-8 is a key step in the onset of apoptosis induced following

c-FLIP gene silencing. We further analyzed the involvement of the
DISC in mediating apoptosis following c-FLIP knockdown using
siRNA to down-regulate FADD. We found that FADD-targeted
siRNA attenuated c-FLIP–targeted siRNA-induced PARP cleavage,
confirming that apoptosis was DISC dependent (data not shown).
The effects of c-FLIP silencing on apoptosis are death
receptor dependent. c-FLIP inhibits caspase-8 activation at
DISCs formed by both Fas and the TRAIL receptor DR5; therefore,
we investigated the roles of these death receptors in mediating
c-FLIP–targeted siRNA-induced apoptosis. DR5 and Fas were
expressed in all four cell lines examined and efficiently knocked
down using specific siRNAs (Fig. 2B). We found that downregulating DR5 cell surface expression in HCT116p53+/+ cells
significantly reduced c-FLIP–targeted siRNA-mediated apoptosis,
whereas down-regulating Fas had less of an effect (Fig. 2C). These
results were confirmed by PARP cleavage analysis (data not
shown). In the HT29 cell line, DR5 down-regulation also had a

c-FLIP Regulates Colorectal Cancer Cell Death

greater protective effect than Fas down-regulation, although Fas
gene silencing still significantly reduced the effects of c-FLIP–
targeted siRNA (Fig. 2C). Moreover, DR5 down-regulation significantly reduced c-FLIP–targeted siRNA-mediated apoptosis in H630
cells; however, down-regulating Fas had no effect. In contrast, in
the LoVo cell line, which expresses a relatively high level of Fas,
down-regulating Fas significantly reduced c-FLIP–targeted siRNAinduced cell death, whereas down-regulating DR5 had no effect.
We have previously found that, unlike the HCT116 cell line, the
H630 and HT29 cell lines also express the other TRAIL receptor
DR4, albeit at a lower level than DR5 (10). However, DR4 gene
silencing in these cell lines failed to inhibit c-FLIP–targeted siRNAinduced apoptosis (data not shown). Collectively, these results
indicate that the involvement of Fas and DR5 in inducing apoptosis
following c-FLIP gene silencing is cell line dependent, with either
one, other, or both involved.
The effects of c-FLIP down-regulation on apoptosis are
death ligand independent. Death receptor–mediated apoptosis is
normally activated following ligation of the receptors by their
respective ligands: TRAIL and FasL. The relative sensitivities of the
colorectal cancer cell lines to TRAIL- and Fas-mediated apoptosis
were assessed using recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) and the Fas
agonistic antibody CH-11. HCT116p53+/+ and H630 cells were
sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas HT29 and LoVo
cells were much more resistant at concentrations up to 10 ng/mL
(Fig. 3A), consistent with our previous findings (10). The p53 wildtype HCT116 and LoVo cells were more sensitive to Fas-induced

apoptosis than the p53 mutant H630 and HT29 cell lines (Fig. 3A).
To examine the requirement for TRAIL and FasL in inducing
apoptosis in response to c-FLIP gene silencing, we used neutralizing antibodies against each death ligand. We have previously
established the effectiveness of the anti-TRAIL and anti-FasL
(NOK-1) antibodies in blocking apoptosis induced by rTRAIL and
recombinant FasL, respectively (7). Interestingly, neither NOK-1 nor
the anti-TRAIL neutralizing antibody had any effect on apoptosis
induced by c-FLIP–targeted siRNA in HCT116p53+/+ cells as
assessed by flow cytometry and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B and C).
Similar results were obtained in the HT29, H630, and LoVo cells
(Fig. 3C). In addition, none of these cell lines constitutively express
detectable levels of cell surface FasL or TRAIL (7). Furthermore,
FasL and TRAIL gene silencing failed to abrogate apoptosis
induced by c-FLIP–targeted siRNA in colorectal cancer cells
(Fig. 3D). Collectively, our results suggest that Fas and DR5 can
constitutively form DISCs in the absence of death ligand binding
and that c-FLIP prevents these DISCs from activating caspase-8
and inducing apoptosis.
Analysis of the individual effects of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS. To
determine the relative importance of the c-FLIP splice variants for
the observed effects of c-FLIP gene silencing on cell viability in
colorectal cancer cells, we designed siRNAs to specifically downregulate each splice form without affecting the other (Fig. 4A).
Specific down-regulation of c-FLIPL (long form siRNA) induced
apoptosis in HCT116p53+/+ cells as indicated by PARP cleavage,
activation of caspase-8, and flow cytometry (Fig. 4B and C).

Specific down-regulation of c-FLIPS (short form siRNA) also
induced significant levels of apoptosis in HCT116p53+/+ cells;
however, the effect was less than when c-FLIPL was downregulated. Specific silencing of c-FLIPL also induced apoptosis in
the HT29, H630, and LoVo cell lines (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
c-FLIPL is an important regulator of colorectal cancer cell death.
Interestingly, specific silencing of c-FLIPS induced more apoptosis
in HT29 cells than specific silencing of c-FLIPL, although the
short form siRNA had no effect in the LoVo and H630 cell lines.
Overall, with the exception of the LoVo cell line, the effects of the
dual-targeted, c-FLIP–targeted siRNA on apoptosis were significantly greater than the effects of either long form or short form
siRNA.
c-FLIP gene silencing inhibits the growth of colorectal
cancer xenografts. To characterize the effect of c-FLIP gene
silencing in vivo, we designed modified c-FLIP–targeted siRNA
duplexes (Stealth RNA interference, Invitrogen). Stealth siRNAs
are more stable than unmodified siRNAs, making them more
attractive for use in vivo. Furthermore, Stealth siRNAs eliminate

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

sense strand off-target effects and nonspecific stress responses that
are induced by traditional siRNAs. Modified c-FLIP–targeted and
long form duplexes, FTstealth and FLstealth, efficiently knocked
down expression of c-FLIPL (and c-FLIPS in the case of FTstealth)
in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5A). Importantly, FTstealth and FLstealth
induced apoptosis in vitro as indicated by PARP cleavage and flow
cytometry (Fig. 5A; data not shown), indicating that the effects of
c-FLIP gene silencing on colorectal cancer cell death were not due
to sense strand off-target effects or activation of nonspecific stress
responses.
To assess the feasibility of silencing c-FLIP expression in vivo
with siRNA, we carried out a small pilot experiment. We implanted
HCT116p53+/+ cells into the flanks of BALB/c SCID mice and
allowed the xenografts to grow to approximately 50 to 100 mm3
before they were injected with 1,000 pmol of liposomal-complexed
FTstealth or SCstealth siRNAs (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis
indicated that c-FLIPL protein expression was down-regulated
24 h after c-FLIP–targeted siRNA injection into the HCT116
xenografts (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, we were not able to detect
c-FLIPS in any of our Western blot analyses of HCT116 xenografts,
suggesting that its expression is much reduced in the in vivo
setting. We next analyzed the effects of FTstealth and FLstealth siRNAs
on the growth of HCT116 xenografts. Once the xenografts reached
a size of f50 mm3, they were injected with 1,000 pmol siRNA on
5 consecutive days (days 6–10). The growth of the xenografts
injected with FTstealth and FLstealth siRNAs was very significantly
inhibited compared with the SCstealth siRNA-injected xenografts
(Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the effects of the c-FLIPL–specific siRNA on
xenograft growth were identical to the dual c-FLIPL/S–targeted
siRNA. Furthermore, caspase-3 activation (as indicated by the
presence of the p19 and p17 processed fragments) was observed
in xenografts harvested from mice in the FTstealth and FLstealth
siRNA treatment groups on day 11 (Fig. 5D). Similar results were
obtained in three additional experiments with the FTstealth siRNA
(data not shown). Preliminary studies using HT29 and LoVo
xenografts have also shown that direct tumor injections with
c-FLIP–targeted siRNA significantly retarded xenograft growth in
both models compared with the scrambled control injected
xenografts (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate
that down-regulating c-FLIP induces apoptosis and inhibits growth
of colorectal cancer cells in vivo.
Effect of c-FLIPL overexpression on growth of colorectal
cancer xenografts. To complement our siRNA studies, we
developed HCT116p53+/+ cell line models that stably overexpress
either c-FLIPL (FL17 cell line) or c-FLIPS (FS19 cell line; ref. 7). We
found that stable overexpression of c-FLIPL, but not c-FLIPS,
significantly reduced the levels of spontaneous apoptosis in
HCT116p53+/+ cells (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, down-regulating
c-FLIPL expression in the FL17 cell line back to control levels
using the long form siRNA brought the levels of apoptosis back up
to that observed in the LacZ control cell line (Fig. 6B), indicating
that the effects of c-FLIPL overexpression on spontaneous
apoptosis were not an artifact of clonal selection. We next wanted
to determine the effect of c-FLIPL overexpression on colorectal
cancer xenograft growth in the presence and absence of
chemotherapy. The combination of the chemotherapeutic agents
5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is used to treat advanced colorectal
cancer patients and has also been shown to improve survival of
patients in the adjuvant setting (11). We tested whether c-FLIPL
overexpression could confer resistance to combined 5-FU and
oxaliplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. As shown by flow

cytometry, c-FLIPL–overexpressing cells were highly resistant to
combined 5-FU and oxaliplatin treatment in vitro (Fig. 6C).
We next implanted HCT116p53+/+ and FL17 cells into the right
and left flanks of BALB/c SCID mice, respectively. We allowed
tumors to grow to approximately 50 to 100 mm3 before the mice
began their treatment regimens. Half of the mice received no
treatment, and half received 5-FU and oxaliplatin [5-FU (15 mg/kg),
days 6–10 and 12–16; oxaliplatin (2 mg/kg), days 6 and 12]. There
was no significant difference between the HCT116 parental and
FL17 xenografts in the untreated (no drug) group until day 16.
However, the c-FLIPL–overexpressing xenografts in the untreated
group were significantly larger on days 18 and 20 compared with
the parental xenografts (Fig. 6D; P < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively).
Most notably, the growth rate of the c-FLIPL–overexpressing
xenografts was significantly less inhibited by chemotherapy
treatment compared with the parental xenografts (days 9–20).
Indeed, the growth rate of untreated and chemotherapy-treated
FL17 xenografts only became significantly different on day 18 after
the second round of chemotherapy treatment was completed.
Of note, the chemotherapy-treated mice had lost a significant
amount of weight at this time (approaching 20% of starting body
weight). This indicates that the animals were stressed by the
chemotherapy treatment, and this may have affected the growth
of the tumors indirectly. Western blot analysis confirmed that
c-FLIPL–overexpressing xenografts expressed f3-fold higher levels
of c-FLIPL compared with HCT116p53+/+ xenografts (Fig. 6D).
Collectively, these results indicate that c-FLIPL–overexpressing
xenografts have a growth advantage in vivo, most notably in the
context of chemotherapy treatment.

Discussion
Death receptor signaling via Fas and DR4/DR5 is regulated by
c-FLIP, which can inhibit caspase-8 activation at DISCs formed

following receptor ligation (5). Multiple c-FLIP splice variants have
been reported; however, c-FLIP is predominantly expressed as two
forms (c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS) at the protein level (12). Both splice
variants have death effector domains, with which they bind to
FADD at the DISC and inhibit caspase-8 activation. Initially, both
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects were proposed for c-FLIP
(13–18). However, enhanced cell death occurred mainly in experiments using transient overexpression techniques and may have
been due to excessive cytoplasmic levels of c-FLIP, which may have
caused clustering and activation of nonmembrane procaspase8 (19). Data from cell lines stably overexpressing c-FLIP and from
mice deficient in c-FLIP support an antiapoptotic function for
c-FLIP (18, 20). More recently, Micheau et al. (21) reported that
c-FLIPL (but not c-FLIPS) actually promotes the first cleavage step
of caspase-8 activation from the proform to the p41/43 form but
prevents further cleavage to the active p10 and p18 subunits,
thereby blocking caspase-8–mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, they
propose that the DISC-bound c-FLIPL-caspase-8 heterocomplex is
a partially active protease restricted to the cell membrane that
can act on substrates localized at the DISC. Our results clearly
show an antiapoptotic role for c-FLIP in colorectal cancer cells, as
siRNA targeting of c-FLIP triggered spontaneous apoptosis in a
panel of colorectal cancer cell lines and inhibited colorectal cancer
tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we have found that c-FLIPL
overexpression reduced spontaneous apoptosis in colorectal cancer
cells and enhanced the growth of colorectal cancer xenografts,
most notably following chemotherapy treatment.
Several studies have shown that down-regulating c-FLIP
sensitizes various tumor cells to apoptosis induced by Fas agonists
and TRAIL (22–25). We recently showed that down-regulating
c-FLIP not only sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to death ligand–
induced apoptosis but also synergistically enhances chemotherapyinduced apoptosis in vitro (7). However, few studies have found
that down-regulating c-FLIP can induce spontaneous apoptosis.

Sharp et al. (26) found that c-FLIP–targeted siRNAs induced
spontaneous apoptosis in A549 non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cells. Dutton et al. (27) found that down-regulating
c-FLIP reduced the viability of Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines in a
manner that was dependent on FasL expression. We have also
found that silencing c-FLIP induces apoptosis in breast cancer (28)
and NSCLC1 cell lines. Furthermore, we found that the mechanism
by which apoptosis was activated in colorectal cancer cells
following down-regulation of c-FLIP was highly caspase-8 dependent, consistent with the reported role of c-FLIP as a caspase8 inhibitor. Examination of the roles of Fas and DR5 in regulating
c-FLIP–targeted siRNA-induced cell death revealed that DR5 was
more important than Fas for mediating the apoptotic signal in the
HCT116, HT29, and H630 cell lines. This is an important finding
because most sporadic and hereditary colorectal neoplasms

express DR5 (29), whereas Fas is often down-regulated during
neoplastic transformation of colon epithelium (30). Although the
lack of complete rescue from c-FLIP–targeted siRNA-induced
apoptosis by DR5 and Fas gene silencing in the HT29 and H630 cell
lines may in part be due to incomplete death receptor downregulation, it also suggests that alternative apoptotic mechanisms
may be induced by c-FLIP gene silencing in these cell lines.
Although DR4 gene silencing had no effect on c-FLIP–targeted
siRNA-induced apoptosis, it is possible that TNF receptor 1 may
mediate at least part of the apoptotic effect following c-FLIP gene
silencing in H630 and HT29 cells. Moreover, it is possible that
non–death receptor functions of c-FLIP may be involved, such as
its interaction with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (31).
Interestingly, in the LoVo cell line, the apoptotic signal following
c-FLIP gene silencing seemed to be mediated primarily through
Fas rather than DR5. The reason for this is unclear, although these
cells do express a comparatively high level of Fas and are sensitive
to the Fas monoclonal antibody CH-11 but not rTRAIL. Collectively,
these results show that DR5 and/or Fas are at least in part

c-FLIP Regulates Colorectal Cancer Cell Death

responsible for the activation of apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells
following c-FLIP gene silencing.
Classically, activation of death receptor signaling was thought to
be triggered following binding of the receptors by their ligands,
which leads to receptor trimerization and assembly of the DISC.
However, recent evidence suggests that members of the TNF
receptor family are expressed as preassociated homotrimers on the
cell surface of resting cells (32). Ligand binding then induces
superclustering of these receptors, resulting in recruitment of
FADD and caspase-8 and activation of apoptosis. However, various
stimuli have been shown to induce clustering of these preassociated homotrimers in a ligand-independent manner (33–38).
Although we found that cell death in response to c-FLIP
knockdown was (at least in part) DR5 and/or Fas dependent, it
was not affected by TRAIL or FasL neutralizing antibodies or
siRNA-mediated TRAIL or FasL gene silencing. Furthermore,
membrane-bound TRAIL and FasL were not detected on these
colorectal cancer cells (7). We hypothesize that colorectal cancer
cells constitutively form c-FLIP–containing DISCs that regulate the
activity of nonapoptotic (or antiapoptotic) signaling pathways in
the absence of death ligand binding. However, when c-FLIP is
silenced, these constitutively formed DISCs activate caspase-8 and
induce apoptosis. A recent study reported that c-FLIPL interacts
directly with DR5 in a TRAIL- and FADD-independent manner and
that disruption of this interaction results in TRAIL-independent
apoptosis (39). The authors suggest that c-FLIPL inhibits ligandindependent recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to DR5. It is
possible that c-FLIPL inhibits ligand-independent recruitment of
FADD and caspase-8 to the DR5 DISC in some colorectal cancer
cell lines and that down-regulating c-FLIPL induces apoptosis by
this mechanism.
With the exception of the HT29 cell line, the relative
sensitivities of the cell lines to rTRAIL and Fas correlated
approximately with the cell surface expression levels of DR5 and
Fas. It is interesting that, although the HT29 cell line is sensitive to
cell death induced by c-FLIP–targeted siRNA, it is resistant to
apoptosis induced by both rTRAIL and CH-11. The HT29 cell line
has relatively low levels of DR5 and Fas expression (Fig. 2B) but
relatively high levels of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS (Fig. 1C). Thus, it may
be that all the DISCs formed following death receptor ligation in
this cell line contain c-FLIP and are therefore unable to fully
activate caspase-8. In support of this hypothesis, we have found
that c-FLIP down-regulation sensitizes HT29 cells to CH-11–
induced and rTRAIL-induced cell death.1 Collectively, these data
suggest that sensitivity to death ligand–induced apoptosis is
dependent on the ratio of death receptor to c-FLIP expression. In
the absence of death ligand treatment, unbound Fas and DR5 can
activate caspase-8 in HT29 cells when c-FLIP is silenced. Thus,
inhibiting c-FLIP can induce apoptosis even in cells that are
resistant to death ligands.
Analysis of the individual roles of the two main c-FLIP splice
forms indicated that specific silencing of c-FLIPL induced
apoptosis in all four cell lines analyzed. Specific silencing of
c-FLIPS also induced apoptosis in two cell lines (HCT116 and
HT29). With the exception of the LoVo cells, specific silencing of
neither c-FLIPL nor c-FLIPS induced as much apoptosis as
simultaneously silencing both splice forms. These findings suggest
that, in most cell lines, the apoptosis induced by loss of one splice
form may be counteracted at least in part by the continued
expression of the other splice form. The reason why HT29 cells are
more sensitive to c-FLIPS down-regulation is unclear. It may be

www.aacrjournals.org

that, in HT29 cells, c-FLIPS is more efficiently recruited to DISCs
than c-FLIPL. In this regard, c-FLIPL recruitment to Fas and TRAIL
DISCs has been reported to be regulated by its phosphorylation
status (40, 41).
This study is the first to show that inhibiting c-FLIP expression
retards tumor growth in vivo. We found that intratumoral delivery
of c-FLIP–targeted siRNA duplexes down-regulated c-FLIP expression, induced caspase-3 activation, and significantly retarded the
growth of HCT116p53+/+ xenografts in BALB/c SCID mice. Indeed,
this effect is not confined to the HCT116 model, as preliminary
studies indicate that the growth of HT29 and LoVo xenografts is
also retarded by c-FLIP siRNA. Furthermore, we found that specific
silencing of c-FLIPL was as effective at inhibiting HCT116 tumor
growth and inducing apoptosis as silencing both splice forms,
suggesting that the long form may be the more important regulator
of colorectal cancer cell viability in vivo. Moreover, we also found
that c-FLIPL overexpression protected HCT116 xenografts from
the growth-inhibitory effects of combined 5-FU and oxaliplatin
treatment. This is consistent with our previous in vitro data (7). It
is important to note that the level of c-FLIPL overexpression
obtained (f3-fold) is similar to levels observed in colorectal
carcinomas (6). Furthermore, at higher tumor volumes, the growth
of c-FLIPL–overexpressing HCT116 xenografts in the non–drugtreated mice was significantly greater than in the parental
xenografts. This agrees with a study by Wang and El-Deiry (42),
which showed that DR5-deficient HCT116 xenografts grew at a
faster rate compared with parental cells at later time points. These
authors further showed that DR5-deficient HCT116 xenografts had
higher proliferation rates and reduced apoptosis compared with
parental xenografts. Overexpressing c-FLIPL may result in the same
phenotype as down-regulating DR5 by blocking spontaneous DR5dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer xenografts. Our results
suggest that colorectal cancer tumors that overexpress c-FLIPL may
be more resistant to the growth constraints (e.g., hypoxia) that
accompany increased tumor volumes.
In previous studies, we have shown that down-regulating c-FLIP
sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to both death ligand–induced and
chemotherapy-induced cell death. Here, we have assessed the role
of c-FLIP in the constitutive regulation of colorectal cancer cell
viability both in vitro and in vivo and also examined the
mechanisms of cell death induced following c-FLIP gene silencing.
We have found that Fas and/or DR5 can constitutively activate
caspase-8 and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines unless this
is blocked by c-FLIP. Of note, death ligand binding to the death
receptors does not seem to be required for this effect. These studies
have direct clinical relevance, as c-FLIP is more highly expressed
in colorectal cancer compared with matched normal tissue (6). This
is the first study to show the functional significance of this increased
expression, providing novel evidence that c-FLIP is a key regulator
of colorectal cancer survival in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
we show for the first time that the growth-inhibitory effects of
chemotherapy are dramatically inhibited by c-FLIPL overexpression
in the in vivo setting. These results suggest that c-FLIP is an
attractive anticancer therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.
