Abstract
Genetic rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) kinase occur in 3% to 13% of non–small cell
lung cancer patients and rarely coexist with KRAS or EGFR mutations. To evaluate potential treatment strategies
for lung cancers driven by an activated EML4-ALK chimeric oncogene, we generated a genetically engineered
mouse model that phenocopies the human disease where this rearranged gene arises. In this model, the ALK
kinase inhibitor TAE684 produced greater tumor regression and improved overall survival compared with
carboplatin and paclitaxel, representing clinical standard of care. 18F-FDG-PET-CT scans revealed almost
complete inhibition of tumor metabolic activity within 24 hours of TAE684 exposure. In contrast, combined
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways did not result in significant tumor regression. We
identified EML4-ALK in complex with multiple cellular chaperones including HSP90. In support of a functional
reliance, treatment with geldanamycin-based HSP90 inhibitors resulted in rapid degradation of EML4-ALK in
vitro and substantial, albeit transient, tumor regression in vivo. Taken together, our findings define a murine
model that offers a reliable platform for the preclinical comparison of combinatorial treatment approaches for
lung cancer characterized by ALK rearrangement. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9827–36. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) and nucleophosmin (NPM) were first identified in
anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) (1). Subsequently,
ALK translocations involving novel partners have been identified in other cancers, including lung cancers (2), where the
oncogenic event is most commonly due to a small inversion on
chromosome 2p that leads to the fusion of ALK, including
the entire kinase domain, with Echinoderm Microtubule–

associated protein-like 4 (EML4), resulting in constitutive
ALK kinase activity (3–6). EML4-ALK translocations are more
frequent in adenocarcinomas and in never smokers (7–9).
There are several EML4-ALK isoforms, all of which contain
virtually identical portions of ALK, and possess potent in vitro
transforming activity (3). The most common isoform is variant
1 (V1), fusing exon 13 of EML4 with exon 20 of ALK (3). This
fusion oncogene has been detected both in primary lung
cancers and in the H3122 cell line (3).
ALK inhibitors, including NVP-TAE684, are effective against
the EML4-ALK H3122 cell line both in vitro and in xenografts
(3, 10). In H3122 cells, TAE684-mediated ALK inhibition
results in downregulation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2
signaling, and apoptosis. The ALK inhibitor crizotinib (PF02341066), currently in clinical development for ALK-rearranged lung cancer, has demonstrated tumor regressions in
approximately 60% of ALK-rearranged lung cancers in an early
phase clinical trial (11, 12). These findings suggest that EML4ALK–driven cancers display features of oncogene dependence
or addiction and that ALK inhibitors may be particularly
effective for this lung cancer subset.
Despite the therapeutic success of kinase inhibitors in
oncogene-addicted tumors, including EGFR mutant lung cancers, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor (GIST), acquired drug resistance develops
universally (13–16). Therapeutic strategies to combat drug
resistant cancers include the use of second-generation kinase
inhibitors, and inhibitors of critical downstream signaling

proteins activated by the mutant kinases. Another approach
involves disruption of HSP90 function, because many mutant
oncoproteins require HSP90 for maturation and conformational stability, and are degraded on HSP90 inhibition (17–19).
To evaluate further therapeutic strategies in ALK-rearranged lung cancer, we have generated a murine lung cancer
model driven by inducible expression of the EML4-ALK fusion
oncoprotein. Using this model, and the H3122 cell line, we
have assessed the efficacy of kinase inhibition, standard
chemotherapy, and HSP90 inhibition. These preclinical
models provide comprehensive platforms to compare and
prioritize potential treatments to evaluate in clinical trials
for this lung cancer subpopulation.

Materials and Methods
Mouse drug treatment studies
The generation of genetically engineered mice harboring a
doxycycline-inducible EML4-ALK fusion gene was similar to
other mouse models we have described (20) and is presented
in detail in the Supplementary Methods. These mice were
imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to document
tumor burden after more than 3 weeks of doxycycline exposure (21). Chemotherapy included carboplatin (50 mg/kg in
PBS) and paclitaxel (10 mg/kg in PBS) and was delivered by
intraperitoneal injection twice weekly. TAE684 (25 mg/kg by
oral gavage), 17-DMAG (LC laboratories; 20 mg/kg by daily
intraperitoneal injection), AZD6244 (AZD; 25 mg/kg), BEZ235
(BEZ; 45 mg/kg), and WZ4002 (25 mg/kg by oral gavage) were
administered as previously described (10, 20, 22). MRI scanning was performed at indicated time points to evaluate
treatment effects. Mice were sacrificed after the last imaging
time point to harvest tumors, and subjected to pathologic
studies (21). Mice used in long-term treatment with different
therapies are listed in Supplementary Table S1. In long-term
experiments, 17-DMAG was administered 5 days per week,
and TAE684 was administered every other day. For pharmacodynamic studies, 2 doses of drugs were administered within
24 hours, with the first dose on day 1 and the second dose on
day 2, 3 hours prior to sacrifice and tumor harvest. Xenograft
studies using nude mice were performed as previously
described (3). For short-term pharmacodynamic studies, mice
were given the same dose of 17-DMAG and sacrificed at days 0,
1, 2, 3, 5. Harvested tumors were snap frozen or formalin fixed
for further study. Positron emission tomography–computed
tomography (PET-CT) and subsequent treatment response
measurements were performed as previously described (22).
All mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility at the
Harvard School of Public Health, and all animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Harvard University. Littermates were used as
controls in all experiments.
Patient samples
Tumors were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of
surgery. Frozen tumors were embedded in optimal cutting
temperature media and sectioned. A hematoxylin and eosin–
stained slide was reviewed and only samples without evidence

of necrosis and with 60% or more tumor content were
chosen for subsequent analyses. Thin sections were used
for RNA preparation using Trizol (Invitrogen). EGFR
(CTGGGGATCGGCCTCTTC and CCGTAGCTCCAGACATCACTCTG) and EML4-ALK (23) genotyping was performed
using RT-PCR. All PCR-positive specimens were verified by
sequencing. Details of the patient specimens are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.
Gene expression profiling and cross-species Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis
Microarray gene expression analysis was performed as
described previously (24, 25). Probe level intensity data files
in the CEL format were preprocessed using Robust Multichip Average program (http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com).
Gene-expression data were filtered using low stringency,
predefined criteria: probe set intensity was 32 in all samples
and dynamic variation was more than 2-fold over the
entire sample set. After filtering, probes representing the
same genes were collapsed into a single value, and standardized by taking the median value for each gene across
the sample set. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was
performed using Genepattern suite (http://broad.mit.edu/
genepattern). A 2-sided t test was used to determine significant differences in gene expression between mouse
tumors harboring EML4-ALK translocation and EGFR mutation. False positives associated with multiple hypothesis
testing were calculated with the False Discovery Rate (FDR)
method. Genes up- or downregulated by EML4-ALK with
fold change greater than 2 and FDR P < 0.05 were considered components of up or downregulated signatures,
respectively. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA; http://
broad.mit.edu/gsea) (26) was used to compare mouse-generated signatures with a rank-ordered gene list obtained
from the human dataset. We used the signal-to-noise ratio
of EML4-ALK–expressing compared with mutant EGFRexpressing tumors to produce this rank-ordered gene list,
and permutation testing and FDR to calculate the significance of enrichment scores.
EML4-ALK variant 1 constructs and retroviral infection
EML4-ALK was cloned into pDNR-Dual (BD Biosciences) as
previously described (3). The retroviral vector, JP1536HA was
created by inserting a FLAG-tag and an HA-tag before the loxP
site of JP1520 vector to allow tagging at the N terminus of the
shuttled construct. The EML4-ALK V1 was shuttled into
JP1536HA, using the BD Creator System (BD Biosciences).
The empty retroviral construct JP1536HA was used as control.
H3122 cells were infected with retrovirus according to standard protocols as described previously (13).
Tandem affinity purification, silver staining, and
LC-MS/MS
Lysates from H3122-EML4-ALK-JP1536HA or H3122JP1536HA–expressing cells were prepared in FLAG IP buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, supplemented with EDTAfree Roche protease inhibitor cocktail]. Lysate (2 mg) was

incubated with 20 mL of anti-FLAG agarose. FLAG-tagged
protein was purified by affinity purification and eluted with
FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluate was incubated with 20 mL
of anti-HA agarose with HA buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10%
glycerol, supplemented with EDTA-free Roche protease inhibitor cocktail]. HA-tagged proteins were eluted with HA
peptide (Covance) from HA-agarose. 10% of the final eluate
was analyzed by silver staining (SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The remaining 90% of the purified protein complexes were analyzed by a gel-free LC-MS/MS method as
described previously (27) with minor modifications (see Supplementary Methods for detailed description).
Cell culture and cell proliferation assays
H3122 cells were maintained as previously described (3) and
standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assays were
used to assess cell proliferation in response to various compounds. (see Supplementary Methods for details of cell culture
and compounds used).
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting and immunoprecipitation using previously described protocols (19, 28).
Antibodies used and experimental procedures are detailed in
the Supplementary Methods.

Results
Expression of the EML4-ALK V1 fusion protein in mice
leads to lung adenocarcinoma that is similar to the
human disease
We generated doxycycline-inducible bitransgenic mice harboring the EML4-ALK (V1) allele (Supplementary Fig. S1A) in
combination with the lung epithelial cell–specific reverse
transactivator allele. In the absence of doxycycline induction,
these mice are healthy with normal lung histology. Doxycycline-dependent lung-specific induction of EML4-ALK expression led to lung tumorigenesis with a latency of less than
10 days (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Lung tumor–bearing mice
rapidly lost weight in the first 4 weeks (Supplementary
Fig. S1C), and had a median survival of 7 to 8 weeks, confirming that EML4-ALK is a potent oncogene (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). Withdrawal of doxycycline led to complete tumor
regression within 2 weeks, as revealed by both MRI and
histology, indicating that tumor initiation and maintenance
are entirely dependent on EML4-ALK expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Detailed histologic analysis of the lungs demonstrated these were adenocarcinomas with predominantly
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features and with occasional
pleural space and airway invasion by an acinar component
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). ALK-rearranged lung cancers in
humans are also predominately observed in adenocarcinomas
(8). Although signet ring cell features have been observed in
human ALK-rearranged lung cancers, we did not observe
signet ring cells in the murine cancers (8, 29).

www.aacrjournals.org

To determine molecular similarities between human and
mouse EML4-ALK lung cancer, we performed gene expression
studies. In both mice and humans, tumors harboring EML4ALK and EGFR mutation demonstrated distinctive expression
profiles, and tumors driven by the same oncogenic alteration
all clustered within the same category, consistent with their
genotypic background (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). We
then derived an EML4-ALK–specific expression signature by
comparing EML4-ALK–driven tumor samples with EGFR-driven tumor samples in mice. Genes up or downregulated by
EML4-ALK with fold change greater than 2 and FDR P < 0.05
were considered components of up- or downregulated signatures, respectively. Subsequent GSEA of these EML4-ALK gene
sets (25) indicated significant correlation (P < 0.05) between
mouse and human tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
These findings suggest that the EML4-ALK mouse lung cancers
are similar to human lung cancer with the same genotype.
ALK kinase inhibitor is a more effective therapy than
chemotherapy in EML4-ALK murine lung
adenocarcinoma
The current standard of care for advanced lung cancer is
cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, for subsets of lung cancer,
defined by an activated kinase oncogenic driver, kinase inhibitors may be more effective, as recently demonstrated for
gefitinib in EGFR mutant disease (30). We therefore investigated whether a similar therapeutic paradigm would apply to
EML4-ALK lung cancer in our preclinical model. We compared
the efficacy of TAE684 (n ¼ 9) to carboplatin/paclitaxel (n ¼ 3)
in mice with MRI-confirmed tumors following doxycycline
induction. Carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment resulted in only
a modest reduction in tumor volume (17%–27%) by 2 weeks as
measured by MRI (Fig. 1A). Continuous treatment did not
result in further tumor regression. Instead, resistance rapidly
developed, and the tumors progressed and exceeded the
original tumor burden by 5 weeks of treatment (Fig. 1A). In
contrast, all of the TAE684-treated mice achieved complete
regression within 2 weeks. Histologic analysis showed grossly
normal lung structure without evidence of tumor cells (Fig. 1B).
Additionally, the clinical condition of tumor-bearing TAE684treated mice improved rapidly (Supplementary Fig. S1C), and
they remained healthy without notable side effects. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), uptake in lung tumors by PET-CT
scan was substantially diminished after only 2 doses of TAE684
within 24 hours, consistent with potent reduction of tumor
metabolic activity, whereas no metabolic response was seen
following treatment using an EGFR kinase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S3). In some of the mice, TAE684 treatment was
then continued over an extended period of time (75 weeks).
To date, drug-resistant tumors have not developed. Withdrawal of TAE684 caused rapid tumor relapse, whereas reapplication of TAE684 reinduced complete regression. In the context
of this model, TAE684 afforded superior survival (P < 0.0001; log
rank test) compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel (Fig. 1).
We next evaluated the effects of TAE684 treatment on
downstream signaling proteins. Mice were treated with either
vehicle or TAE684, sacrificed 2 hours following treatment
and tumors examined by immunohistochemistry. In the

pathways. Small areas (insets) of pAkt staining are enlarged to compare signals before and after TAE684 treatment. Red arrows, tumor cells. Staining and

TAE684-treated mice, there was significant downregulation of
p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, p-S6, and p-STAT3, all of which have been
previously identified in signaling pathways engaged by NPMALK (31–34) (Fig. 1D).
Inhibition of PI3K and MEK, but not STAT3, suppresses
growth of an EML4-ALK-expressing lung cancer cell line
and modestly inhibits tumor progression in vivo
Simultaneous inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/
ERK1/2 pathways has been successful in preclinical models of
KRAS and EGFR mutant non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) (21, 32), prompting us to evaluate a similar strategy
in EML4-ALK–driven murine lung cancer and in the H3122
cells. Additionally, previous studies in ALCL harboring NPMALK rearrangement demonstrated the importance of STAT3

activation (32). In these cells, STAT3 is mainly activated by
JAK3, a client of NPM-ALK (35). Because the expression of
JAK3 is largely limited to hematopoietic tissues (36, 37),
whether STAT3 activation plays a critical role in EML4-ALK
lung tumor cells is unknown. The STAT3 inhibitor, S3i-201 (38)
was not effective in H3122 cells. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor
AZD and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ suppressed
H3122 proliferation either as single agents or in combination
(Fig. 2A and B). The treated cells demonstrated downregulation of phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK 1/2 (Fig. 2C). mTOR
activity was also sharply reduced with BEZ (Fig. 2C). The
concentration levels of AZD and BEZ are comparable with the
effective concentrations used previously in EGFR mutant
NSCLC cell lines (39). However, in the murine model of
EML4-ALK lung cancer, combined inhibition of MEK and

Lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies, demonstrating expected effects on signal transduction by these compounds.
D, EML4-ALK tumor-bearing mice were treated with the combination of AZD6244 and BEZ235. Tumor volumes were documented by MRI imaging. Mice were
sacrificed after 2 weeks of treatment for pathologic analysis. Scale bar, 100 mm.

PI3K/mTOR signaling, using previously established treatment
conditions and dosing schedules (22), resulted in only modest
reduction in tumor burden after 2 weeks of treatment. Among
4 treated mice, we detected tumor regression of approximately 20%, comparable with the efficacy achieved by chemotherapy, but far less effective than TAE684 (Fig. 2D). We
were not able to perform experiments utilizing the triple
combination of AZD/BEZ and S3i-201 due to unacceptable
systemic toxicity. We also employed a JAK3 inhibitor, CP690550, at established doses (40, 41) in combination with
AZD/BEZ, but did not observe enhanced tumor regressions.
EML4-ALK interacts with HSP family members
To further study ALK signaling and to identify additional
potential therapeutic targets, we examined EML4-ALK–asso-

ciated proteins using tandem affinity purification coupled with
mass spectrometry. We constructed an EML4-ALK V1 expression vector tagged with FLAG and HA, introduced it into H3122
cells followed by 2 rounds of immunoprecipitation-based
purification (Fig. 3A). We identified several interacting proteins
(Fig. 3A) and analyzed these by MS (Supplementary Table S3A).
As anticipated, we detected EML4 (both full length and EML4ALK) and ALK (from EML4-ALK only) as among the most
abundant proteins (detected by 13 and 8 unique peptides,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). Additionally,
we also detected heat shock protein (HSP) family members
(HSPA5 (BIP/grp78) and HSPA8 (HSC70)) as abundant interacting proteins (both detected by 5 unique peptides; Supplementary Fig. S4C and D). Neither protein was detected in the
control affinity purification.

Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 17-AAG for 1 hour. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody
followed by Western blotting for the indicated proteins. C, H3122 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 17-AAG for 24 hours and lysates
analyzed by Western blotting for the indicated proteins, demonstrating depletion of ALK and downstream signaling proteins at a 17-AAG concentration as low
as 25 nmol/L. D, H3122 cells were treated with TAE684 or 17-AAG for 72 hours, and analyzed using the MTS assay.

To validate the physical association of the HSP protein
complex and EML4-ALK, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the FLAG/HA-tagged EML4ALK expression construct. Both HSPA5 and HSPA8, which
were identified by MS, coprecipitated with EML4-ALK
(Fig. 3B). Moreover, additional HSP family members,
including HSPA1A (HSP70) and HSP90, were also detected
in association with EML4-ALK (Fig. 3B). We further
confirmed the endogenous association of HSP90 in the
H3122 cells with ALK by immunoprecipitation with an
HSP90 antibody. ALK and 2 other known HSP90 partners,
cdc37 and p23, were detected in complex with HSP90
(Fig. 3B). The association of EML4-ALK and HSP90 was
disrupted by 17-AAG–mediated HSP90 inhibition (Fig. 3B).

These findings suggest that HSP family members may play
a critical role in protein folding and structural stability of
EML4-ALK.
To determine a functional role for HSP family members in
maintaining stability of EML4-ALK, we treated H3122 cells
with 17-AAG. EML4-ALK was efficiently depleted following
17-AAG treatment, with concomitant extinguishing of downstream signaling, evident by reduced p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and
p-S6 (Fig. 3C). HSP70 expression increased following 17-AAG
treatment, a pharmacodynamic marker of effective HSP90
inhibition (42). Furthermore, 17-AAG inhibited H3122 proliferation with an IC50 of 20 nmol/L (Fig. 3D). Taken
together, our findings indicate that EML4-ALK is a sensitive
HSP90 client.

HSP90 inhibition causes regression of EML4-ALK–
driven H3122 xenografts and murine lung
adenocarcinomas
To confirm a potential therapeutic effect of HSP90 inhibition
on H3122 cells in vivo, we established xenografts and treated
the mice with either vehicle or the water-soluble geldanamycin
17-DMAG. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, 17-DMAG caused tumor
regression in this model. Additionally, short-term treatment
with 2 doses of 17-DMAG within 24 hours confirmed marked
reduction in total ALK expression, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 4B) and Western blotting
(Fig. 4C) of harvested xenografts. We further observed
HSP70 induction in the xenografts, consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of 17-DMAG treatment (Fig. 4C).
We next treated tumor-bearing EML4-ALK transgenic mice
with 17-DMAG. Similar to the results with H3122 xenografts,
we observed an average of 84% tumor regression (n ¼ 5,

www.aacrjournals.org

Supplementary Table S4) within 1 week of treatment (Fig. 5A,
mouse 292). Histologic analysis showed remnant cancer cells
and dramatic restoration of normal lung structure (Fig. 5B).
We continued to treat these mice for an extended period of
time, and documented tumor volume each week by MRI
(Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S4). Our results showed that
tumor response was not durable, and varied significantly
among mice during treatment (Supplementary Table S4).
To determine whether 17-DMAG impacted survival, we
compared treatment with 17-DMAG to placebo. Median survival increased from 7 weeks in the placebo group to 21 weeks
in the 17-DMAG–treated group, (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5C). This
improvement in overall survival was noted even though the
durability of response did not match that achieved with
TAE684 (Fig. 6A).
We also performed pharmacodynamic studies using tumors
from the 17-DMAG–treated animals. After short-term treatment (24 hours), 17-DMAG treatment results in reduced
expression of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2, similar to tumors from
mice treated with TAE684 and AZD/BEZ (Fig. 6B). However,
in recurrent tumors harvested after long-term treatment
(40 days), signaling was restored, as demonstrated by pAKT and p-ERK 1/2 levels similar to vehicle-treated mice
(compare Fig. 6B and Fig. 6C). Nonetheless, HSP70 induction
was noted in recurrent tumors, consistent with continued
inhibition of HSP90 during the treatment course (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
ALK-rearranged lung cancers are a subset of cancers that
are clinically sensitive to ALK inhibitors (11, 12). The ALK
inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) is currently undergoing
clinical development in a randomized phase III trial and
is being compared with standard chemotherapy. However,
much remains to be understood about EML4-ALK biology,
and the identification of alternative strategies to treat
these cancers remains a clinical priority, because acquired
resistance to targeted ALK inhibition is likely to emerge.
A recently published study described a mouse lung cancer
model initiated by constitutively over-expressed EML4-ALK
driven by lung-specific surfactant C promoter. This transgenic
model also showed responses to an ALK-specific inhibitor
(43). However, the short life span of these mice after birth, due
to early expression of EML4-ALK in the late stage of embryonic development, potentially limits its use in performing
comparative studies of different treatment strategies. We thus
developed a new EML4-ALK mouse lung cancer model that
phenocopies the molecular features of human ALK-rearranged
lung cancer, and allows us to compare and prioritize therapeutic approaches.
Using this model, we demonstrate that inhibition of ALK
activity, using TAE684, is more effective than conventional
chemotherapy (Fig. 1C). The degree of tumor regression is
analogous to that of EGFR kinase inhibitors used to treat
mutant EGFR-driven murine lung cancers (44). However, in
contrast to EGFR mutant lung cancer, the combination of
PI3K and MEK inhibitors, although effective in vitro, was
not effective in our EML4-ALK mouse model (39). These

Targeting ALK and HSP90 to Treat EML4-ALK-Driven Lung Cancer

discrepancies attest to the importance of preclinical in vivo
disease modeling in evaluating potential efficacy of individual treatment approaches. Our pharmacodynamic results
indicated that both pAkt and pERK1/2 are efficiently suppressed by BEZ and AZD, suggesting that other potential
EML4-ALK effector(s) may act to promote tumor survival in
vivo, and could serve as important therapeutic target(s). It is
possible that the strong expression of the EML4-ALK fusion
protein in our model system may also require higher drug
concentrations or more potent compounds for complete pathway inhibition. Further work will be required to address this
issue and determine whether combined PI3K/MEK inhibition
is a worthwhile strategy in EML4-ALK–driven lung cancer.
To identify other potential therapeutic targets, we demonstrate the association of EML4-ALK with several intracellular
chaperones, including HSP90 (Fig. 3B). Previous studies
suggested that NPM-ALK is also a client of HSP90 and
HSP70 (45–47). We further demonstrated that geldanamycin
compounds caused dissociation of HSP90 from EML4-ALK,
and were effective in vitro, and in a xenograft model and in our
murine adenocarcinoma model in vivo. In fact, 17-DMAG
ranked second of the 4 treatments evaluated in the EML4ALK–driven murine lung adenocarcinomas, and was more
effective than chemotherapy and combined PI3K/mTOR/
MEK inhibition (Fig. 6A and D).
Despite impressive initial responses to 17-DMAG
responses were not durable. This result is similar to those
observed with geldanamycins used to treat murine adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR mutation (19, 48). The mechanism by which resistance develops is presently not defined.
However, we detected upregulation of HSP70 in mice that
have developed resistance to 17-DMAG (Fig. 6C) suggesting
continued HSP90 inhibition. Possible mechanisms of resistance to 17-DMAG could involve alterations in ALK, changes
in expression pattern of intracellular chaperones or emergence of an oncogenic driver not dependent on HSP90 for
conformational stability. Nonetheless, HSP90 inhibition

tripled the survival of treated mice, indicating the importance of the initial tumor response. Of note, the geldnamycin
IPI-504 has demonstrated preliminary activity in NSCLC in a
phase III trial; 2 of 5 patients who achieved partial response
had tumors harboring EML4-ALK translocations (49). These
clinical findings further highlight the similarities of our
mouse model to human EML4-ALK NSCLC. Further assessment of HSP90 inhibition, both with geldanamycin and new,
potent nongeldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor compounds, is
warranted (28, 50) and may represent an alternative
approach to targeted ALK inhibition.
In summary, we have developed a model of EML4-ALK
NSCLC that is similar both in molecular features (gene
expression profile) and treatment response (ALK TKI
and HSP90 inhibitor) to human EML4-ALK NSCLC. This
preclinical model will be a useful tool for evaluating future
therapies in this subset of NSCLC.
