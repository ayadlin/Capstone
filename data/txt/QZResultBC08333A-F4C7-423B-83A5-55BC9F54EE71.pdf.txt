Abstract
The bone marrow microenvironmental components interleukin (IL)-6 and fibronectin (FN) individually influence the
proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells;
however, in vivo, these effectors most likely work together.
We examined signaling events, cell cycle progression, and
levels of drug response in MM cells either adhered to FN via B1
integrins, stimulated with IL-6, or treated with the two
combined. Although G1-S cell cycle arrest associated with FN
adhesion was overcome when IL-6 was added, the cell
adhesion–mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) was maintained in the presence of IL-6. Concomitant exposure of MM
cells to IL-6 and FN adhesion revealed a dramatic increase in
signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding,
compared with either IL-6 or FN adhesion alone in four MM
cell lines. Importantly, this increase in STAT3 activation
correlated with a novel association between STAT3 and gp130
in cells adhered to FN before stimulation with IL-6, relative to
nonadherent cells. Taken together, these results suggest a
mechanism by which collaborative signaling by B1 integrin
and gp130 confers an increased survival advantage to MM
cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):1009–15]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by
the monoclonal expansion of plasma cells. Although numerous
genetic alterations have been implicated in MM pathogenesis, it is
hypothesized that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment also
contributes to MM cell pathogenesis (1–6). The BM microenvironment consists of a complex array of factors that promote cell growth
and survival, and may contribute to minimal residual disease and the
development of acquired drug resistance (7–14). These BM factors
can be divided into two categories: (a) soluble factors including
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, and (b) physical factors
that include extracellular matrix glycoproteins and BM stromal cells.
Interleukin (IL)-6, regarded as one of the most important
cytokines in MM disease progression, promotes the proliferation
and survival of MM cells through the activation of Janus kinase
(Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3),
Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and PI3

kinase/Akt/PKB signaling pathways (15–19). Signal transduction
follows binding of IL-6 to gp80/IL-6Ra and recruitment of gp130/
CD130 (20). The subsequent formation of a hexameric signaling
complex, containing two molecules each of IL-6, gp80, and gp130,
induces dimerization of gp130 and receptor phosphorylation by
constitutively bound Jak family tyrosine kinases (Jak1, Jak2, and
Tyk2; refs. 21, 22). In regard to STAT3 signaling, phosphorylation of
four c-terminal tyrosine residues in the gp130 subunit has been
proposed to facilitate the recruitment and phosphorylation of
STAT proteins. STAT phosphorylation promotes its dimerization,
nuclear translocation, and DNA-binding, followed by the
transactivation of genes involved in a number of cellular functions
including proliferation, differentiation, and survival (15, 18, 20, 23).
Of the physical factors of the BM microenvironment, the
glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) has also been shown to control the
growth, survival, and drug resistance of MM cells (1, 4, 9–12). FN
adhesion activates a4 or a5 and h1 (a4h1 & a5h1) integrin
heterodimers via unique molecular aggregates using associated
nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and, in some cases,
recruitment of receptor PTKs (RPTK) for intracellular signaling
(24, 25). Signaling via these integrin complexes confers resistance
to a multitude of proapoptotic effectors including serum
deprivation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and death receptor ligation
(CD95/Fas; refs. 13, 26).
Because of the influence of the BM microenvironment in MM
progression, it is important to define not only the role of individual
components of the BM but also the manner by which both soluble
and physical factors of the microenvironment collaborate in MM
tumorigenesis. To date, the soluble factor IL-6 and the physical
factor FN have been examined independently. However, in vivo, it is
most likely that these factors collaborate to influence myeloma cell
survival. Therefore, elucidation of biochemical mechanisms
associated with these factors alone, and in combination, is
important in defining the effects of the microenvironment on cell
survival and proliferation.
In this report, using a simple cellular model, we examined
intracellular signaling and the biological sequelae after stimulation with IL-6 alone, FN adhesion alone, or their combination in
MM cell lines. Importantly, we show that IL-6 and FN adhesion
collaborate to activate STAT3 but not ERK1/2 or Akt. Furthermore, this collaboration parallels an increase in gp130 complex
phosphorylation and a novel IL-6–independent preassociation
of STAT3 with gp130 when cells are adhered to FN. This work is
significant because it shows that IL-6 stimulation does not
reverse CAM-DR but does reverse FN-mediated cell cycle arrest.
Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism by which
collaborative signaling by h1 integrin and gp130 confer a survival
advantage to MM cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells and materials. Four MM cell lines used were as follows: RPMI 8226
[RPMI supplemented with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)],
MM1.S (kindly provided by Dr. Steve Rosen, Northwestern University,
Chicago, Illinois; 10% FBS, RPMI), H929 (10% FBS, RPMI supplemented with
0.0004% h-mercaptoethanol), and U266 (10% FBS, RPMI). Cells were
maintained in culture in the respective concentration of FBS in RPMI
supplemented with 1.0% penicillin/streptomycin and L-Glutamine (Life
Technologies). Experiments (up to 6 h) were carried out under serumfree conditions. Antibodies used were as follows: STAT3 (1:2,000) and
phosphor-STAT3 (1:1,000) in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/TBS 0.1%
Tween 20 (Cell Signaling), gp130 (1:250; BD Pharmingen), h1 integrin (1:250;
Chemicon), h-actin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant human IL-6 was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Protein isolation and Western blot analysis. Cells, after incubation
under the indicated conditions, were washed twice with ice cold PBS, and
incubated for 10 min at 4jC in Triton X-100 lysis buffer [30 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10%
glycerol, 2 mmol/L Na-orthovanadate], with 1 Complete, Mini protease
inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) per 10 mL Triton X-100 buffer. Protein
lysates were quantitated with Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad) and 10 to 50 Ag of
cellular lysates were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein levels were examined with
specific antisera and visualized with SuperSignal-Pico or SuperSignal-Dura
Light (Pierce).
EMSA analysis. STAT3 DNA-binding assays were performed on nuclear
extracts prepared in hypertonic buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9),
420 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 20% glycerol,
20 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L Na4P2O7, 1 mmol/L DTT, and
0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. Five micrograms of total
protein were incubated with a double-stranded 32P-radiolabeled hSIE
oligonucleotide probe and visualized as previously described (15).
Immunoprecipitation. Cells were maintained in suspension or adhered
to FN for 60 to 90 min in the presence or absence of 1.0 ng/mL rhIL-6. Cells
were washed twice in ice cold PBS and harvested as previously described (1).
Cells were incubated in TBS [30 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl] containing 1% NP40, 0.1% sodium azide, 20 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L Na4P2O7, and 1 Complete, Mini protease inhibitor
cocktail tablet for 10 min on ice. Cellular debris was removed by
centrifugation at 10,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Lysates were quantified via
Bio-Rad reagent and between 2 and 4 mg of protein were used per sample.
Samples were precleared with 10 AL of Protein Plus A/G agarose beads
(Santa Cruz Biotech) for 60 min rotating at 4jC. Slurries were centrifuged
(800  g for 1 min at 4jC) and supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes
containing 1 Ag anti-gp130 antibodies or isotype control antibodies (BD
Pharmingen) and incubated overnight rotating at 4jC. Protein Plus A/G
agarose beads (10 AL) were added and lysates were incubated an additional
2 h. Immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed twice in TBS containing
1% NP40 and 0.1% sodium azide, and 3 additional times with TBS containing
0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% BSA (Roche). Immunoprecipitates were mixed
with 4 SDS loading dye and 100 mmol/L DTT and incubated for 5 min at
95jC. After centrifugation (800  g for 2 min) samples were separated on 4%
to 12% NuPAGE SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
All assays were performed on cells in logarithmic growth. Cytotoxicity was
determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay as previously described (1). Briefly, cells were incubated with
serial dilutions of mitoxantrone or doxorubicin (Sigma) under the various
conditions for 96 h. Cells were then incubated with 50 AL MTT dye (Sigma)
for 4 h. Plates were centrifuged, aspirated, and formazan was solubilized
with DMSO. Absorbance was determined with a Dynex II ELISA plate reader
at 540 nm (Dynex Technologies).
BrdUrd analysis. The effects of FN adhesion FIL-6 on cell cycle
progression were measured by two-color flow cytometry using FITCconjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibody and PI staining
(BD Biosciences) of DNA content. Cells were incubated on FN-coated

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

60-mm dishes or maintained in suspension on noncoated plates for 48 h.
After the 48-h incubation, samples were prepared as previously described
(4). After preparation, samples were analyzed for BrdUrd incorporation
and PI staining by flow cytometry.

Results
Adhesion of the RMPI 8226 MM cell line to FN enhances IL-6
signaling. Signaling by the soluble BM effector IL-6 elicits
biological effects in MM cells via Jak/STAT3, ERK1/2, and PI3-K/
Akt signaling pathways (15, 16, 19). Cell adhesion to FN via h1
integrins also initiates several signaling pathways involving
ERK1/2, Akt, src-family tyrosine kinases, and RelB (25, 27). To
date, the intracellular signaling of these two determinants has been
examined independently. Here, we investigated the combination of
both IL-6– and FN-mediated cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 1A,
adhesion of RPMI 8226 cells to FN enhanced their response to IL-6
stimulation. Treatment of FN-adhered RPMI 8226 cells with 0 to
10 ng/mL recombinant IL-6 results in a dose-dependent increase in
the phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2, with no consistent
stimulation of Akt, at 2 hours poststimulation with IL-6
(ERK and Akt data not shown; Fig. 1A). Further comparison of
IL-6–dependent STAT3 phosphorylation in suspension and

adherent cells incubated with IL-6, correlating with the phosphorylation data.

Amplification of STAT3 Signaling via gp130 and b Integrins

Figure 2. FN adhesion of the RPMI 8226 MM cell line augments IL-6–mediated
STAT3 phosphorylation and DNA-binding for up to 6 h. A, Western blot analysis
showed enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation 30 min after h1 integrin and IL-6
stimulation, and elevated levels of phosphorylated STAT3 remained for up to
6 h in cells adhered to FN, compared with cells maintained in suspension after
incubation with 1.0 ng/mL IL-6. B, increased STAT3 phosphorylation correlated
with increased STAT3 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding as shown by
EMSA.

adhered cells revealed a 10-, 6.25-, and 3-fold increase in STAT3
phosphorylation in adhered cells over suspension cells at 0.1, 1.0,
and 10 ng/mL of recombinant IL-6, respectively. A parallel 3-fold
increase in STAT3/DNA complexes was seen in cells adhered to
FN relative to cells in suspension, as measured by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (Fig. 1B). Super-shift assays showed primarily
STAT3 homodimers, with a paucity of STAT3:STAT1 heterodimers
being observed (data not shown). These results show that
adhesion of MM cells to FN alters STAT3 signaling via the IL-6
receptor. One explanation for the increased capacity of IL-6
signaling in RPMI 8226 cells adhered to FN may involve an upregulation of the IL-6 receptor a (gp80) or gp130. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that surface expression of both gp80 and gp130
remained unchanged after adhesion of RPMI 8226 cells to FN
(data not shown), indicating that the observed changes in STAT3
phosphorylation are not mediated by changes in the levels of IL-6
receptor components.

To examine the possibility that FN-adhesion stimulates IL-6
production in an autocrine fashion, we measured IL-6 production
by ELISA in supernatants from RPMI 8226 myeloma cells cultured
in suspension versus those adhered to FN. Under both conditions,
soluble IL-6 remained undetectable from 0.5 to 4.0 hours (data not
shown). Based on these findings, we conclude that an FNadhesion–mediated production of IL-6 does not contribute to
STAT3 signaling in costimulated cells.
FN adhesion results in a sustained activation of STAT3
phosphorylation and DNA binding. Signaling via cytokines and
associated receptors occurs via a transient early activation of
specific signaling determinants on the order of minutes. As shown
in Fig. 2, costimulation of RPMI 8226 cells with IL-6 and FN
augments STAT3 phosphorylation (30 minutes), and this increase
in STAT3 phosphorylation is maintained for at least 6 hours (Fig.
2A). Mobility shift assays similarly showed amplified and sustained
STAT3 DNA-binding in cells adhered to FN after incubation with
IL-6 compared with cells maintained in suspension (Fig. 2B). These
results show that the augmentation of IL-6–mediated STAT3
signaling is maintained for up to 6 hours in RPMI 8226 cells
adhered to FN relative to cells not engaged with FN.
The collaboration between h1 integrin–mediated adhesion and
IL-6 is observed in all four MM cell lines examined. In this report,
we have shown that cellular adhesion to FN potentiated IL-6
stimulated STAT3 activity in the RPMI 8226 cell line. Similar results
were observed in three additional MM cell lines. As shown in Fig. 3,
STAT3 phosphorylation in MM1.S, U266, and H929 MM cells was
increased 1.9 (P < 0.05), 4.1 (P < 0.05), and 5.5-fold (P < 0.05),
respectively, in cells costimulated with IL-6 and adhesion to FN
when compared with cells treated with IL-6 in suspension.
Importantly, the increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed in
the RPMI 8226 cell line after costimulation was not consistent
across the cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, although
phosphorylation of Akt was observed in the MM1.S and H929 MM
cell lines after IL-6 stimulation, this response was unchanged by
FN-mediated cell adhesion (data not shown). Together, these
results suggested that the effects of FN adhesion on IL-6 signaling
may be relatively specific for STAT3.
Activation of B1 integrins further augments IL-6–mediated
STAT3 activity. We have shown that MM cell adhesion to FN
augments IL-6–induced STAT3 signaling. However, the specific
contribution of h1 integrins has yet to be addressed. Our lab has
previously shown that pretreatment of RPMI 8226 cells with

Figure 3. FN adhesion promotes increased
IL-6–mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in MM1.S,
H929, and U266 MM cell lines. Western blot analysis
showed increased STAT3 phosphorylation in MM1.S,
H929, and U266 MM cells adhered to FN after
stimulation with IL-6 (1.0ng/mL), relative to cells
maintained in suspension or adhered cells alone.
Quantification of three independent experiments
(phosphorylated STAT3/total STAT3) using image
quant software showed that IL-6–dependent STAT3
phosphorylation in cells adhered to FN relative to those
in suspension was increased as follows: MM1.S,
1.87-fold (P = 0.041); U266, 4.47-fold (P = 0.027);
H929, 5.47-fold (P = 0.022).

Figure 4. Enhanced h1 integrin–mediated adhesion further augments STAT3 activity after IL-6 stimulation. h1 integrin–mediated adhesion of the U266 cell line to
FN is enhanced by h1 integrin activating antibodies. Pretreatment of U266 cells with h1 activating antibodies increases the STAT3 phosphorylation (A ) and DNA binding
(B) mediated by IL-6 to a greater degree than FN alone. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with IL-6 receptor blocking antibodies inhibited STAT3 activation.

antibodies that block h1-integrins inhibits adhesion to FN (1). In
the following experiments, we used antibodies to h1 integrins that
instead promote an active conformation, thereby increasing the
binding potential of h1 integrins. To this end, pretreatment of cells
with h1 integrin activating antibody should enhance the amplification of IL-6–dependent STAT3 activation caused by FN adhesion,
if h1 receptors are involved. The U266 MM cell line only modestly
adhered to FN and pretreatment of cells with h1 integrin–
activating antibodies increased U266 cellular FN adhesion (data
not shown). In Fig. 4, we showed that adhesion of U266 cells to FN
enhances IL-6 mediated STAT3 protein phosphorylation and DNA
binding. Furthermore, preincubation of U266 MM cells with
activating h1 integrin antibodies further enhanced the effects of
adhesion on STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), nuclear translocation, and STAT3 DNA binding (Fig. 4B) in costimulated cells. These
data show a central role for h1 integrin–mediated adhesion in the
heightened response observed with the combination of IL-6 and FN
adhesion on STAT3 signaling. Additionally, we show that
pretreatment with IL-6 blocking antibodies attenuates the signaling
effects mediated by the collaboration between IL-6 and h1 integrin
mediated adhesion. IL-6 receptor blocking antibodies also completely blocked the modest increase in STAT3 phosphorylation and
DNA binding observed in U266 cells adhered to FN with h1
activating antibodies in the absence of exogenous IL-6 (Fig. 4A and
B versus 6 versus 8). These results indicate that the observed slight
increase in STAT3 phosphorylation in the absence of recombinant
IL-6 may result from the potentiation of relatively low levels of
cytokine produced in the IL-6 autocrine loop known to be present
in the U266 MM cell line (15). This slight increase, however, is very
minor compared with the dramatic increase observed when these
cells are costimulated with both IL-6 and h1 integrin–mediated
adhesion (Fig. 4), suggesting that any autocrine IL-6 produced by
U266 cells does not contribute substantially to the observed
amplification of IL-6–dependent STAT3 activation mediated by
adhesion to FN.
Adhesion of MM cells to FN facilitates an IL-6–independent
recruitment of STAT3 to gp130. The signaling events initiated
after IL-6 ligation are relatively well-characterized. IL-6 binding to
its cognate receptor facilitates gp130 homodimerization, activation
of Jak family kinases, phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues
within the cytoplasmic domain of gp130, and activation of STAT3
(20). To further characterize the receptor proximal effects of FN
adhesion on IL-6 signaling, we immunoprecipitated the IL-6R
complex with antisera to gp130. Immunoprecipitation of gp130
revealed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130/Jak

family complexes after stimulation of FN-adhered RPMI 8226 cells
with IL-6 (phosphotyrosine at 125–130 kDa; Fig. 5). Consistent with
increased phosphorylation of the receptor complex, increased
levels of phospho-STAT3 were found to be associated with gp130
under costimulatory conditions relative to IL-6 or FN adhesion
alone. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation with gp130 antibodies
also revealed an association between STAT3 (nonphosphorylated)
and gp130 in the absence of IL-6 stimulation in cells adhered to FN
(Fig. 5, lane 1 versus 3). To our knowledge, this is the first example
of h1 integrin–mediated preloading of STAT3 to the receptor
complex. Moreover, these data suggest that FN adhesion facilitates
an altered localization of STAT3, priming cells for signaling.
CAM-DR is maintained despite a reversal of FN-mediated
cell cycle arrest after incubation with IL-6. In MM, IL-6 and FN
adhesion have been shown to protect cells from a host of cytotoxic
stimuli (1, 2, 4, 7, 23). These reports suggest that the increased
levels of STAT3 observed after IL-6 stimulation of FN-adhered cells
may confer a greater protection against chemotherapeutics than
FN adhesion alone. However, MTT cytotoxicity assays show that

Figure 5. Adhesion of MM cells to FN facilitates recruitment of STAT3 to
gp130 independently of IL-6 stimulation. Examination of receptor proximal
events via immunoprecipitation of gp130 revealed enhanced tyrosine
phosphorylation of the gp130/Jak family complexes in RPMI 8226 cells
stimulated with IL-6 while adhered to FN (phosphotyrosine at 125–130 kDa).
Increased levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were also observed in association
with gp130 under costimulatory conditions relative to IL-6 or FN adhesion alone.
STAT3 (nonphosphorylated) was also observed in association with gp130 in
cells adhered to FN in the absence of IL-6 stimulation (lane 1 versus 3 ).

although adhesion to FN provides significant protection against
treatment with either mitoxantrone or doxorubicin (P < 0.0002 and
P < 0.0001, respectively), the addition of IL-6 provides no further
protection (Fig. 6A and B). Further analysis of drug-mediated
apoptosis using FCM by Annexin-V/7-AAD corroborated these
findings (data not shown).
Our laboratory has previously showed that adhesion of the RPMI
8226 cell line to FN-mediated a p27Kip1-dependent G0-G1 cell cycle
arrest (4). As shown in Fig. 6C, by BrdUrd/PI analysis, adhesion of
8226 cells to FN for 24 h results in an increased number of cells in
G0-G1 relative to cells maintained in suspension (P = 0.0028),
corroborating our previously published data. In contrast, when

cells were adhered to FN in the presence of IL-6 no accumulation
of cells in G0-G1 was observed, with levels similar to that observed
in cells maintained in suspension with or without stimulation by
IL-6 (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the addition of IL-6
bypasses or reverses the cell cycle arrest mediated by cellular
adhesion to FN. Examination of p27Kip1 expression showed
increased levels of p27Kip1 protein after adhesion to FN relative
to cells maintained in suspension, consistent with our original
findings. Interestingly, although the combination of FN adhesion
and IL-6 reversed/bypassed the cell cycle arrest mediated by
adhesion alone, p27Kip1 protein expression remained elevated
under costimulatory conditions (data not shown). These data
indicate that communication between integrins and IL-6 alters
proliferative response mediated by either effector alone independent of p27Kip1. Importantly, although the combination of IL-6 and
FN adhesion does not further increase drug resistance compared
with FN adhesion alone, the cell cycle arrest mediated by adhesion
to FN is ‘‘reversed’’ by costimulation with IL-6. IL-6–induced cell
proliferation may give adhered tumor cells an added survival
advantage over the long term in vivo.

Discussion

Figure 6. CAM-DR is maintained despite a reversal of the FN-mediated cell
cycle arrest in costimulated MM cells. CAM-DR has been shown to protect
cells from the cytotoxic agents mitoxantrone and doxorubicin. Furthermore,
IL-6–mediated STAT3 signaling events also elicit cytoprotective effects.
Together, these data suggest that the observed cooperation between FN
adhesion and IL-6 may facilitate a greater protection than either effector alone.
As shown by 96-h MTT analysis of MM cell survival, treatment of FN-adhered
cells with IL-6 showed no survival advantage in response to (A) mitoxantrone
or (B) doxorubicin compared with that mediated by FN alone. C, FCM
analysis using BrdUrd/PI incorporation assays showed that FN adhesion
facilitates an accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle by 24 h.
As shown, treatment of cells adhered to FN with IL-6 (1.0 ng/mL) reversed
the adhesion-mediated arrest. *, no statistical difference; c, statistical difference,
respectively, as determined by ANOVA.

Research that focuses on the biology/pathogenesis of MM has
long included the effectors of the BM microenvironment. The
soluble factor IL-6 and FN-mediated cell adhesion are two factors
that independently control MM cell cycle progression and
sensitivity to proapoptotic agents (1, 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 23). However,
the BM microenvironment likely affords MM cells a network of
proliferative and survival factors; therefore, in vivo a MM cell
receives stimulation from soluble and physical BM determinants
simultaneously. In this report, using a simple model, consisting of
only MM cell lines, IL-6 and FN, we begin to recapitulate this
network of extracellular factors to investigate the molecular and
biological consequences of costimulation of MM cells. We showed
that the combination of IL-6 and cellular adhesion to FN results in
a dramatic amplification of STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear
translocation and DNA-binding via a novel preloading of gp130
with STAT3. These observations show collaboration between IL-6
receptor complexes and h1 integrins and underscore the
complexity of interactions between MM cells and the BM
microenvironment. Although interactions between integrins and
cell surface receptors have been shown to enhance STAT activation
(22, 28–31), to our knowledge, these results are the first illustrating
specific STAT3 crosstalk between gp130 and integrins. Most
previous reports demonstrating this phenomenon involved RPTKs
(30, 31); however, DeFilippi and colleagues (29) showed a h1
integrin–mediated enhancement of STAT5 activation by the
common IL-3 h receptor. This receptor, like gp130, is a Type I
cytokine receptor without intrinsic kinase activity (29). Here, we
identify a second Type I cytokine receptor involved in crosstalk
between soluble and adherent factors, suggesting that this signaling
mechanism involves a common mechanism across diverse receptor
families. Furthermore, we describe a unique molecular mechanism
by which cooperative signaling between gp130 and h1 integrins
provides a survival advantage to MM cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents.
Stimulation of cells with IL-6 results in receptor multimerization
and the activation of three major signaling pathways, the Jak/
STAT3 pathway, the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway and PI3 kinase/Akt/PKB
pathway (20). In this report, enhanced STAT3 activation was

observed in all four MM cell lines examined. In contrast, enhanced
ERK1/2 activation was observed in only one of four cell lines, and,
although Akt activation was observed in three of four cell lines, in
all three cases, it occurred independently of FN adhesion. These
results indicate that the mechanism of collaboration is relatively
specific for STAT3. Consistent with these observations, we showed
that the enhanced activation of STAT3 correlated with a FN
adhesion–mediated binding of STAT3 to gp130.
Our observations suggest that FN adhesion facilitates a
preloading of gp130 with STAT3 that enhances STAT3 activation.
Dogma dictates that recruitment of STAT3 follows gp130 receptor
stimulation and phosphorylation. So, in this context, our results
suggest that either: (a) the adhesion of MM cells to FN facilitates
the phosphorylation of gp130 and recruitment of STAT3 without
measurable STAT3 activation—in agreement with current dogma,
or (b) FN adhesion facilitates the association between gp130 and
STAT3 independent of gp130 phosphorylation—suggesting a more
complex regulation of STAT3 signaling from gp130. To address the
former, integrin signaling from focal adhesions has been shown to
involve ligand-independent activation of RPTKs (24, 32). To this
end, the collaboration between h1 integrins and gp130 may involve
a direct association and activation of gp130 by integrin ligation and
focal adhesion formation. To date, we have been unable to show
direct association between gp130 and h1 integrins (data not
shown), but that does not fully exclude a direct or indirect
activation by focal adhesion–associated tyrosine kinases.
It is also possible that we have identified an additional level of
regulation. Although gp130 phosphorylation has been shown to be
integral in STAT3 activation, the growing list of STAT chaperone
proteins suggests that regulation of gp130/Jak/STAT signaling may
be more complicated. The STAT chaperone proteins, including
Receptor of Activated Protein Kinase C-1 (RACK1), GlucoseRelated Protein 58 (GRP58/ER-60/ERp57), and PKC-y have been
shown to enhance STAT signaling in several cellular models
(33–35). One example, RACK1, a 36-kDa WD40-containing scaffold
protein, has been found to participate in the enhanced activation of
Src, PKC, STAT1 and most recently STAT3 (33, 36, 37). Zhang and
colleagues (33) showed that RACK1 facilitates the recruitment of
STAT3 to Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor-I receptors.
Importantly, the effects of RACK1 were specific to STAT3, having
no affect on Akt or ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, RACK1 has been
shown to associate with h1 integrins and to facilitate formation of
functional focal adhesions (38). These studies suggest that RACK1
(or other chaperones) may be a catalyst for the collaboration
between h1 integrin–mediated adhesion to FN and gp130.

Beyond the biochemical changes shown in this report, the
collaboration between IL-6 and FN cell adhesion also has
biological consequences. Here, we show that the collaboration of
these two prosurvival effectors did not afford a survival advantage
beyond levels conferred by CAM-DR. This was consistent with
levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, which remained unchanged in
response to costimulation in the RPMI 8226 cells (data not
shown). In contrast, costimulation did facilitate an altered
proliferative response. The collaboration between IL-6 and h1
integrins results in a bypass of the p27Kip1-dependent cell cycle
arrest mediated by FN adhesion alone, in the face of unchanged
levels of p27Kip1 (4). Previous studies suggest that changes in cell
cycle progression after enhanced STAT3 signaling involve
increased levels of specific D-type cyclins (23). However, no
observable increases in cyclin D expression were detected as a
result of enhanced STAT3 activity in the RPMI 8226 cell line (data
not shown). Therefore, it seems that h1 integrin and IL-6–
mediated STAT3 signaling in RPMI 8226 cells may target alternate
antiapoptotic and/or proliferative factor(s).
Lastly, an expanding number of reports have been published
examining the effects of BM stromal cells on MM biology (reviewed
in ref. 14), providing novel insight into the dynamics between MM
cells and the BM microenvironment. In this report, we have ‘‘scaled
back’’ the environmental cell model and used two relatively wellcharacterized MM BM effectors to examine the biological
consequences of costimulation in MM cells. We identify STAT3
as an important signaling effector involved in the collaboration
between the physical environment and the soluble environment.
Our findings suggest that adhesion to FN facilitates an alteration in
the cellular localization of STAT3, priming gp130 for stimulation.
As such, the environmental context of the cell may have significant
bearing on intracellular signaling events, modulating both
myeloma cell survival and proliferation.
