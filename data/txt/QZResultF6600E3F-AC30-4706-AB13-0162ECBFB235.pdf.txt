ABSTRACT
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is still an incurable disease despite the
great scientific effort performed during the last years. The huge heterogeneity of this
disease has motivated the evaluation of a great number of therapies against different
molecular alterations. In this article, we review the biological bases of this entity
and how the known molecular evidence supports the current preclinical and clinical
development of new therapies. Special attention will be given to ongoing clinical
studies and potential options for future drug combinations.

INTRODUCTION

some TNBC patients. The group of patients that obtain a
pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, have a better clinical outcome than those
that do not achieve such response [12]. However, in the
metastatic setting chemotherapy shows limited efficacy
and most patients soon progress to these agents.
The poor clinical prognosis, the limited long term
efficacy of chemotherapy and the absence of targeted
therapies support research to identify new targets and
develop novel therapies against this cancer. In this
review we will discuss novel biological findings that
are therapeutically exploitable as well as combinations
of agents to efficiently augment and optimize existing
therapies.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a
clinicopathological entity which includes breast tumors
that do not express immunohistochemically detectable
estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors [1]. They
account for around 15% of all breast cancers, being more
frequently expressed in young women and those from
African and Hispanic descendants [1-3]. Genomic studies
have revealed the heterogeneous nature of TNBC [4-6].
Indeed, this entity has been classified by gene expression
analyses in several subgroups, including two basal-like
(BL1, BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal
(M), a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) and a luminal/
androgen receptor (LAR) subtype [5]. A similar study
but using a smaller dataset described four groups that
mimic the previous reported subtypes: luminal/androgen
receptor (LAR), mesenchymal (MES), basal like/immunesuppressed (BLIS) and basal like/immune activated
(BLIA) [7].
Although heterogeneous, most TNBC share
common clinical features such as poor long term prognosis
or a specific pattern of relapse, mainly during the first five
years after diagnosis [8]. In addition, some data suggests
that the IM and BLIA subgroups are associated with an
enrichment of lymphocytes and are those with better
outcome [5, 7]. These findings are in line with recent
studies suggesting that TNBC with tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) have better prognosis [9, 10].
Due to the lack of druggable known targets most
patients with TNBC are treated with chemotherapy
[11]. Chemotherapy regimens have clinical activity in

NOVEL THERAPEUTIC POSSIBILITIES
IN TNBC
Molecular and functional studies have unraveled
cellular functions that are important in the generation/
progression of TNBC. On the bases of these studies,
agents targeting distinct components of those functions
have been developed. Figure 1 provides a schematic view
of key components of such cellular functions for whom
therapeutic agents have been developed. Some of them,
already approved or under clinical evaluation, are shown.

DNA repair mechanisms
In TNBC alterations of the DNA repair machinery
seem to be of significance, as there is an increased

presence of somatic or acquired mutations in DNA repair
genes, mainly BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Those genes
code for key tumor-suppressor proteins that are important
components of the homologous recombination DNA
repair mechanism [13, 14] (Figure 2). In this context,
chemotherapies that affect DNA like platinum compounds,
and agents that act by inhibiting the PolyADP-Ribose
Polymerase (PARP) protein have been evaluated in this
subtype of breast cancer. Platinum chemotherapy causes
DNA damage through induction of adducts or DNA
crosslinking. These lesions are normally repaired through
base excision repair mechanisms in which PARP1 plays an
essential role. Platinum compounds have moderate activity
in unselected TNBC tumors but are more active than
taxanes particularly in tumors harboring BRCA mutations
[15, 16].
Given the fact that in BRCA1/2 mutated tumors
PARP inhibitors produce a synthetic lethality interaction
[17, 18] (see Figure 2), these compounds are currently
in clinical development in this indication. Recently,
olaparib, an agent that targets several PARP isoforms
including PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3, has been approved
for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients harboring
deleterious mutations of the BRCA1/2 genes [19, 20].
In TNBC several phase II trials have evaluated various
PARP inhibitors. Olaparib showed clinical activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

when patients were selected for BRCA1 mutations, with
response rates from 13-50% depending on the number
of prior chemotherapies or the previous exposure to
platinum-compounds [20, 21]. Of note, in unselected
patients efficacy was very limited [22]. Velaparib is
another inhibitor that targets PARP1 and PARP2. In a
phase II trial clear signs of activity were observed with
velaparib in combination with temozolomide in BRCA1
mutated patients [23]. Ongoing phase III studies with
PARP inhibitors are shown in Table 1.
Other druggable proteins that are involved in DNA
repair include ATR or its effector kinase Chk1 [24]. Their
inhibition has shown promising preclinical activity in
TNBC that lack the expression of ERCC1 [25]. In this
context, agents targeting these proteins are currently
in clinical development (see Tables 2 and 3). Finally,
agents that bind DNA like novel mithramycin analogs
(mithralogs) or trabectedin have also shown activity in
preclinical models, but their potential antitumoral activity
in the clinical setting requires evaluation [26, 27].

Targeting the mitotic process
TNBC is characterized by its high proliferation
rate [1, 11, 28]. Recent studies have demonstrated that

kinases involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle,
such as TTK/Mps1, polo-like kinases (PLKs) or NIMA/
NEK2, are overexpressed in this particular breast cancer
subtype [29]. Agents against TTK or PLKs have shown
antitumor activity in preclinical models and are currently
under clinical development [30-33]. In the case of NIMA,
knockdown of this gene in triple negative tumors induced
cell cycle arrest followed by cell death [34]. Similarly,
targeting aurora kinases A and B has shown an antitumoral
effect in TNBC and these agents were synergistic with
MEK inhibitors and agents targeting microtubules [35,
36].

that have preferentially been explored in TNBC. BET
inhibitors belong to a new family of compounds that by
inhibiting bromodomains can modify gene transcription
[37]. These compounds have shown activity in several
tumor types like neuroblastoma, where the expression of
the transcription factor c-Myc was reduced; or in breast
cancer by affecting key signaling elements involved
in resistance to targeted agents [38, 39]. One of these
compounds OTX015 is currently under early clinical
development [40]. In preclinical models BET inhibitors
have shown clinical activity in TNBC synergizing with
chemotherapies used for the treatment of this disease
[41, 42]. On the other side, HDACi have shown activity
on TNBC tumor initiating cells [43, 44] and some of
these agents are currently in phase II studies, mainly in
combination with platinum-based therapies (see Table 2).
Through inhibition of the kinase activity of the
cyclin-dependent kinases CDK7, CDK9 and CDK12
several agents have been reported to indirectly control
transcription. These CDKs modulate the activity of the
RNA polymerase II large subunit through phosphorylation
at its C-terminal domain [45]. Such phosphorylation is

Gene expression modulators
In a heterogeneous disease like TNBC targeting
epigenomic components that can indirectly control several
oncogenic functions represents an attractive approach.
Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibitors
and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are two
types of agents with an epigenetic mechanism of action

A recent study has shown that CDK7 inhibition triggers
cell death in preclinical models of TNBC, opening the
door for the potential evaluation of CDK7 inhibitors in
the clinical setting [46]. Moreover, the dual CDK7 and
CDK9 inhibitory drug TG02 has shown antitumor effect
in TNBC [47]. Interestingly, CDK12 has been associated
with genomic stability [48], one of the characteristics
of BRCA1/2 mutated TNBCs. In TNBC attenuation of
CDK12 function increases the effect of PARP inhibitors
[49].
As indicated above, the molecular classification of
TNBC includes the luminal androgen receptor subtype,
characterized by the expression of that receptor. In fact,
approximately 10-15% of TNBCs express the AR [50,
51]. In this context several studies are exploring the role
of targeting AR in this setting [52]. Single agent phase

II studies have evaluated the clinical activity of antiandrogens in estrogen receptor negative or triple negative
breast tumors. In these studies the clinical benefit rate
defined as complete response, partial response and stable
disease was around 40% at 4 months [53, 54]. Although
the clinical activity of anti-androgens is not impressive,
these data have stimulated the design of further studies
in TNBC.

nuclear processes such as those defined above, targeting

receptors, studies on the fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR) family have shown that 9% and 4% of TNBC
have FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplification, respectively
[55, 56]. Inhibition of these receptors has been shown to
reduce tumor growth in preclinical models, supporting the
evaluation of agents against FGFR in the clinical setting
[57, 58].
In the case of signaling routes, particular emphasis
has been placed in the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway.
Molecular studies indicated that this route is activated in
10-15% of TNBC, and such activation may be caused by
mutations, loss of suppressor phosphatases like PTEN or
INPP4B; or in a small proportion of patients, amplification
of AKT [59, 60]. Of note, PIK3CA mutations seem to
be more frequent in the mesenchymal subtype [28].
Recent studies showed the relevant role of PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors in TNBC and their synergistic interaction with
chemotherapy [61]. Interestingly, inhibition of this route
produced only a cytostatic effect, but when combined with
chemotherapy the association induced cell death [61].
Another kinase with a relevant role in TNBC that
has been recently described is ERK5. Expression of this
protein was associated with worse outcome; and agents
inhibiting its function produced an anti-proliferative effect

[47, 62]. Combination of ERK5 kinase inhibitors with
chemotherapy was synergistic [47].
Targeting multiple key intracellular signaling nodes
can be a better strategy than inhibiting single kinases
[63]. In line with that idea novel multikinase inhibitors
have shown preclinical activity mainly when targeting the
PI3K/mTOR and the JAK/STAT pathways [64].
Finally, it should be mentioned that strategies aimed
at inhibiting EGFR did not meet expectations. Clinical
studies showed no signs of potential activity when
combined with chemotherapy [65]. A similar lack of clear
efficacy was observed for antiangiogenic therapies, with
studies showing no benefit [66]. Even considering the lack
of data to support these strategies in the clinical setting,
some studies are currently exploring novel compounds
against these targets in clinical trials, as can be seen in
Table 2.

oncological diseases. Among the various strategies tested,
those using antibodies aimed at augmenting the cellular
immune response against tumors, particularly with the use
of checkpoint immunologics, and agents directed to cell
surface proteins have progressed to the clinic.
With respect to agents aimed at modulating
the cellular immune response, blockade of cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed
cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1)
with antibodies has shown clinical benefit in different
indications [67]. In breast cancer, expression of PD-L1
has been described in 20% of TNBC [68]. Breast tumors
with presence of CTLA-4 have been linked with a worse
outcome [69]. However, expression of these antigens
cannot fully predict response to antibodies targeting
them. A recent clinical study with the anti-PD-1 antibody
pembroluzimab has shown evidence of clinical activity
with a good safety profile [70]. In this context, some
phase III studies are currently analyzing the antitumoral

action of anti-PD-1 antibodies either as monotherapy or in
combination with chemotherapy (see Table 1).
In addition to those strategies that have shown
potential clinical efficacy, the immunomodulatory
properties of the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1)
could be manipulated for treating TNBC. Knocking
out CSF-1 in mice susceptible to breast cancer resulted
in reduced macrophage recruitment to the tumor and
delayed metastasis [71]. This may be a consequence
of the immunosuppressive action of tumor-associated
macrophages. In the clinical setting the ratio among
neutrophils and lymphocytes predicts worse outcome
when it is higher than a certain level, also suggesting
the deleterious role of neutrophils on cancer [72]. In
preclinical models the role of neutrophils in relation
to lung colonization of metastases in breast cancer has
recently been reported [73]. CSF-1-receptor inhibition
increased CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and enhanced
antitumor response to paclitaxel in xenograft models [74].

Figure 2: Synthetic lethality interactions for PARP inhibitors. In synthetic lethality two different pathways participate to sustain

a cellular function. In the case shown in the figure, single strand DNA repair is accomplished by the action of PARP. In case the lesion
progresses to a double strand break, it can be repaired by the action of BRCA1. In case one of the pathways is impaired (e. gr. by loss of
function of BRCA1), the cellular function is still supported by the action of the other pathway. An alteration in a base, or a single strand
break is usually repaired by the base excision repair mechanism, in which PARP proteins play an essential role. If inhibitors of PARP are
used, then the single strand alteration may evolve to double strand breaks. The repair of lesions depends on the integrity of BRCA proteins.
In patients whose tumors are defective in BRCA activity, the PARP inhibitors create DNA double strand breaks that are not repaired, leading
to cell death.

Agents with this mechanism of action are currently in
phase II studies (Table 2).
The second group of immunologic agents is based
on the recognition of cell surface proteins by antibodies,
or modified versions of antibodies carrying a cytotoxic
drug. Two novel ADCs are in clinical development.
IMMU-132 is an ADC against Trop-2 conjugated to the
irinotecan metabolite SN-38 [75]. Trop-2 is a calcium
signal transducer transmembrane protein that is expressed
in normal tissue and overexpressed in many tumors [76].
IMMU-132 has shown promising signs of activity in
early clinical studies [77]. IMMU-132 has received fast
track designation from the FDA for metastatic TNBC
(Table 1). Glembatumumab vedotin is an ADC against
the glycoprotein non-metastatic B (gpNMB) expressed
on the membrane of cancer cells. gpNMB was associated
with worse outcome in breast cancer patients, particularly
those with a triple negative phenotype [78]. In this case
the antibody is linked to monomethyl auristatin E, a
potent antimitotic agent [78]. Glembatumumab vedotin
has demonstrated promising signs of activity in TNBCs

overexpressing gpNMB and is now in clinical evaluation
[79]. Other ADCs include those against the folate receptor
(see Table 2).

Pathways involved in stemness
TNBC is a subtype of cancer where subpopulations
of cells with stem-like characteristics are present. In
this context, targeting signaling pathways involved in
biological functions associated with the maintenance of
the stem cell phenotype, has been explored preclinically.
The JAK/STAT pathway is preferentially active in basallike tumors [64, 80]. Inhibition of this pathway with
kinase inhibitors produces tumor regression in preclinical
models [64, 80]. Another pathway that participates in
the maintenance of stem cell properties is the Notch
signaling pathway [81]. Mutations at NOTCH1, NOTCH2
and NOTCH3 and rearrangement at NOTCH1 have
been described, and inhibition of NOTCH cleavage
with gamma-secretase inhibitors has shown activity in
preclinical models [82, 83]. Some studies are currently

Figure 3: CDK7 and CDK9 act as regulators of RNA polymerase II, an enzyme critical in mRNA production which is
required for protein synthesis. RNA polymerase II is recruited to gene promoters by transcription factors, and is phosphorylated in
its C-terminal domain heptad repeats. At these heptad repeats, CDK7 phosphorylates RNA polymerase II on serine 5 during initiation of
transcription, and CDK9 phosphorylates serine 2 during elongation of the transcripts. The activity of CDK7 and CDK9 can be targeted by
the dual inhibitor TG02.

2 and 3).

predictors of response to PARP inhibitors. Similarly,
molecular alterations in other DNA-repair genes, including
ATM, Fanconi’s anemia genes or CHEK2, predict
response to PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer [89].
The principal mechanism of resistance to PARP
inhibitors includes the presence of mutations at the
BRCA1/2 genes that restore their function [90, 91]. The
presence of alternative splicing of the BRCA gene has
also been suggested as a potential mechanism of resistance
[92].

Inducing cell death by targeting apoptosis
Direct induction of cell death by using agonists
of cell death receptors or inhibitors of anti-apoptotic
proteins can represent another antitumoral strategy
in TNBC. Agents that act on inhibitors of apoptotic
proteins (IAPs) have shown potential signs of activity in
different preclinical models [84, 85]. LCL-161 is a second
mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)
mimetic that has shown clinical activity in TNBC in
combination with paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting,
when selecting patients with a specific gene signature
[86]. Recently, two articles have described the role of
PIM kinase inhibition as an effective antitumor strategy in
basal-like tumors [87, 88].

OPTIMIZING
STRATEGIES

BET and CDK inhibitors
Association of BET inhibitors has shown to be
synergistic with chemotherapy in preclinical models
of lymphoma and TNBC [37, 42, 93]. Recent data in
hematological malignancies suggest that WNT signaling
and rewiring of transcriptional programs are potentially
associated with primary and secondary resistance to BET
inhibitors [94]. Preclinical data suggest that inhibition of
CDK12 can increase the effect of PARP inhibitors [49].
The CDK7/9 inhibitor TG02 was shown to synergize with
chemotherapy, especially with taxotere, in TNBC cellular
models [47].

COMBINATORIAL

Given the fact that TNBC is a heterogeneous disease,
combined inhibition of relevant vulnerabilities seems to be
a better approach than targeting individual events. This is
in line with the clinical experience which demonstrated
that targeting of individual routes often results in escape
of inhibition of tumor growth by secondary activation of
other protumorigenic routes. The development of novel
drug combinations to improve management of patients
with TNBC requires identification of tumors that most
likely would respond to a given combination. In addition,
and given the fact that TNBCs are sensitive to classical
chemotherapies, the new drug is expected to be tested in
combination with one of those chemotherapies. Below
we will discuss drug combination strategies focusing
on opportunities for clinical development and their
limitations.

Kinase inhibitors
As mentioned before, a wide range of these
agents have been evaluated in combination. The reason
behind this is the complementary antitumoral action
when combining several kinase inhibitors. In addition,
such combinations may be more effective by inhibiting
mechanisms of resistance that were developed by
activation of secondary loops [95]. In this context the main
limitation for targeted combinations, beyond the lack of
efficacy in the clinical setting, is related to the overlapping
of toxicities, mainly when different kinase inhibitors are
combined. For example, preclinical data suggested the
synergistic antitumoral effect when combining PI3K and
MEK inhibitors [96, 97]. However early phase studies
evaluating PI3K and MEK inhibitors in combination
showed poor tolerability [98]. The combinations of drugs
targeting both pathways seemed to have greater activity
in KRAS mutated tumors, mainly ovarian tumors, but
the high grade of toxicity observed, limited the clinical
development [98].
An alternative approach for the clinical development
of these compounds could be to combine these agents with
standard chemotherapy. This is for instance the case for
the association of PI3K inhibitors with taxanes. While
targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by itself is only
cytostatic, combination of PI3K inhibitors with agents
targeting mitosis produces a cytotoxic effect in preclinical
models [61]. That circumstance could translate into an
increase in efficacy in the clinical setting. In fact, such

DNA-damaging agents
The finding that a number of TNBC present
alterations in DNA repair mechanisms opened the
possibility of exploiting this situation and fostered the
development of PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors are
synergistic with agents that induce double strand breaks.
Among chemotherapies that produce double strand breaks,
platinum compounds and temozolomide are the most
used in the clinical setting, for glioblastoma and TNBC,
respectively (Tables 2 and 3).
The adequate use of PARP inhibitors in combination
with other compounds provoking DNA damage relies on
the identification of tumors that may be sensitive to the
combination. In this respect, mutations in BRCA1 and
BRCA2 genes have been reported to be the principal

strategy is now being evaluated in some clinical studies
(Tables 2 and 3). A similar approach has been taken for
the clinical development of spindle checkpoint kinase
inhibitors that are under evaluation in combination with
taxanes (Tables 2 and 3). Finally, combinations of PI3K
inhibitors with anti-androgens or PARP inhibitors are
under evaluation, as described in other parts of this review.

clinical evaluation [105]. However, combinations should
be explored with caution: for instance the association
of vemurafenib to ipilimumab in melanoma showed
an unacceptable hepatotoxicity limiting therefore their
clinical development [106].

PI3K and AR inhibitors

Immunologic agents

Given the fact that the LAR subtype is the one more
enriched with mutations at the PIK3CA gene [28], studies
evaluating the combination of anti-androgens with PI3K
inhibitors are currently ongoing.

Predicting which patients may respond to an
immune-based antitumoral strategy remains one of the
aspects that still requires much research. In the case of
ADCs, the first step in their use is to define the degree
of expression of the target that would confer therapeutic
advantage. In this respect, preclinical data obtained in
other tumors indicates that overexpression of the target
is usually accompanied with sensitivity. The use of novel
techniques like positron emission tomography imaging of
radioactively labeled antibodies (immunoPET) could help
selecting those patients that will have a clinical response
[99].
One of the potential mechanism of resistance to
ADCs, as happens with antibodies, is associated with
the limited drug distribution within the tumor due to
their high molecular weight or tumor vascularization
[100]. Similarly, elimination of chemotherapy from the
intracellular compartment to the extracellular matrix could
be another mechanism of resistance [101]. In this context,
it has been suggested that chemotherapy can augment the
activity of ADCs by destroying tumoral tissue, therefore
facilitating the penetration of ADCs in different tumoral
areas [102]. In the same line, new ADCs are designed to
increase the payload ratio of chemotherapy linked with
each antibody [103], so the amount of drug that reaches
the tumor is higher. Another attractive possibility could be
the use of ADCs targeting the stroma in combination with
antitumor ADCs.
How to boost the anticancer properties of immune
checkpoint modulators is an intensive area of research. In
this case, the presence of various immune modulators in
the tumor microenvironment appears to have an important
role. Expression of checkpoint regulators PD-1, PD-L1
or CTLA-4 appears to be necessary but not sufficient to
explain sensitivity to blocking antibodies against them.
Some other cellular components of the tumor stroma,
such as tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived
suppressor cells, or Treg lymphocytes may create an
immunosuppressive environment that could prevent a
strong antitumoral response by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
Some studies have suggested that the kinase inhibitor
ibrutinib, that inhibits the BTK and ITK kinases, when
added together with PD-L1 inhibitors, can boost the
immune response by modulating the balance among T
lymphocytes [104]. In several tumor types, combination
of PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-VEGF strategies is under
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CONCLUSIONS
A wide range of targeted agents against different
oncogenic and non-oncogenic vulnerabilities are currently
under evaluation in TNBC. Unfortunately, classification of
breast cancer by transcriptomic profiles has not contributed
substantially to the identification of new targets or to the
stratification of patients for new compounds. Indeed,
the role of these subtypes in the clonal evolution of
cancer tumors is under evaluation at this moment, with
preliminary results not supporting a major role [107].
PARP inhibitors are currently in the late stages of
drug development in TNBC patients with mutations at
BRCA genes, suggesting that these compounds could be
incorporated to the therapeutic armamentarium to fight
this disease in the near future. Other families of agents
with promising activity are novel ADCs and immune
checkpoint inhibitors, both with ongoing phase III studies.
On the other hand, the major limitation for all these
compounds is the identification of biomarkers of response
or companion diagnostics.
How to integrate these agents for treatment
combinations is challenging and should always try to
avoid the overlapping of toxicities. A proper evaluation
of the selected combination in preclinical models should
be mandatory before clinical testing. Finally, given the
fact that chemotherapy is the standard of care in TNBC,
the development of novel combinations will probably
contemplate the use of the compounds together with a
chemotherapeutic agent.
