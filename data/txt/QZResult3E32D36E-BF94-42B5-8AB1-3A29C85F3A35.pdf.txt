Abstract
The recessive deficiency in thiopurine methyltransferase
(TPMT), caused by germ-line polymorphisms in TPMT, can
cause severe toxicity after mercaptopurine. However, the
significance of heterozygosity and the effect of the polymorphism on thioguanine or in the absence of thiopurines is not
known. To address these issues, we created a murine knockout
of Tpmt. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of
mercaptopurine and thioguanine were done in Tpmt / ,
Tpmt +/ , and Tpmt +/+ mice and variables were compared
among genotypes. Methylated thiopurine and thioguanine
nucleotide metabolites differed among genotypes after treatment with mercaptopurine (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.044,
respectively) and thioguanine (P = 0.011 and P = 0.002,
respectively). Differences in toxicity among genotypes were
more pronounced following treatment with 10 daily doses
of mercaptopurine at 100 mg/kg/d (0%, 68%, and 100%
50-day survival; P = 0.0003) than with thioguanine at 5 mg/
kg/d (0%, 33%, and 50% 15-day survival; P = 0.07) in the
Tpmt / , Tpmt +/ , and Tpmt +/+ genotypes, respectively. Myelosuppression and weight loss exhibited a haploinsufficient
phenotype after mercaptopurine, whereas haploinsufficiency
was less prominent with thioguanine. In the absence of
drug challenge, there was no apparent phenotype. The
murine model recapitulates many clinical features of the
human polymorphism; indicates that mercaptopurine is more
affected by the TPMT polymorphism than thioguanine; and
provides a preclinical system for establishing safer regimens of
genetically influenced antileukemic drug therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
One of the clearest examples of a pharmacogenetic polymorphism affecting drug efficacy and toxicity in humans is that caused
by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency (1–5). Thiopurines (mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and azathioprine) are
commonly used as antineoplastics and immunosuppressants, but
their proper use remains uncertain and is complicated by the

TPMT polymorphism. Inherited as an autosomal codominant trait
(6–8), TPMT activity in erythrocytes (reflective of other tissues as
well; refs. 7, 9–11) exhibits a trimodal population frequency
distribution (12–14). TPMT activity is inversely related to the
concentration of active thioguanine metabolites after administration of thiopurines (4). The rare homozygous deficient individuals
develop extreme myelosuppression, which can be fatal when given
usual doses of thiopurines (15), necessitating a 10-fold dosage
decrease to prevent such toxicity (16). Heterozygotes, constituting
10% of the population, often exhibit an intermediate degree of
toxicity following mercaptopurine (17), although the role of
heterozygosity in dosing thiopurines is somewhat controversial.
Patients with homozygous wild-type (high) activity may be at
increased risk of poor treatment response (e.g., persistence of
leukemia; ref. 18).
Due to the inherent toxicity and possible carcinogenicity of
thiopurines (19–21), conducting randomized clinical trials to fully
explore how best to use these agents in humans has ethical
constraints. For example, there is considerable interest in studying
the relative importance of the TPMT polymorphism for thioguanine
versus for mercaptopurine, particularly because recent clinical trials
have suggested a lower relapse rate with thioguanine treatment in
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). TPMT activates the
mercaptopurine riboside intermediate metabolite of mercaptopurine, but this methylated metabolite is not present after administration of thioguanine (22). Thus, it would be useful to directly
compare the effect of the TPMT polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of thioguanine versus mercaptopurine (3, 23). In addition, there has been much speculation about
whether the polymorphism in TPMT has any biological significance
in the absence of thiopurine challenge (2, 24).
In humans, the molecular basis of the TPMT polymorphism is
largely related to three common nonsynonymous coding singlenucleotide polymorphisms (13), each of which renders the protein
unstable (25) and subject to enhanced ubiquitination and
degradation (26, 27). Thus, the homozygous deficiency in humans
is characterized by almost undetectable levels of TPMT protein;
heterozygotes have intermediate protein and activity levels; and
homozygous wild-type individuals have high levels of protein and
activity (28, 29).
We created a murine model to allow the controlled study of the
TPMT polymorphism. This model has allowed us to compare the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of thioguanine and
mercaptopurine in an in vivo isogenic system and to show that
biological consequences of the TPMT polymorphism are evident
only in the presence of drug challenge.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Mercaptopurine, thioguanine, 2-deoxyguanosine, 6-thioguanosine, 6-mercaptopurine riboside, and 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside
were purchased from Sigma. Alkaline phosphatase was purchased from
Promega. 6-Thio-2¶deoxyguanosine was purchased from R.I. Chemical, Inc.
All other chemicals and reagents were of high-performance liquid
chromatography grade. A folic acid–deficient purified diet for mice was
purchased from TestDiet. Methotrexate and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Sulfatrim pediatric suspension) were purchased from Alpharma.
Targeting construct design and generation. A clone containing the
murine Tpmt gene was identified by screening a 129/Ola murine genomic
DNA library, packaged in a P1 artificial chromosome vector (Genome
Systems), with the assistance of Dr. Evgeny Krynetski and Dr. Mike Fessing
(30, 31). The identified clone was verified to contain the Tpmt genomic
locus by Southern blotting, sequencing, and fluorescent in situ hybridization. To generate the targeting construct, an 8.7-kb KpnI restriction
endonuclease fragment encompassing part of exon III through a portion of
intron 6 was subcloned into the pZERO-2 vector (Invitrogen). A herpes
simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene cassette was cloned into the HindIII
site of the pZERO vector at the 3¶ end of the Tpmt insert, and a 2.8-kb PacI/
XmaI fragment, internal to the 8.7-kb KpnI fragment and containing exons
V and VI, was replaced with a neomycin phosphotransferase gene cassette.
Generation of targeted mice. E14 embryonic stem cells provided by the
laboratories of Dr. James Ihle and Dr. Gerard Grosveld (St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital) were electroporated in the presence of linearized Tpmt
targeting vector DNA. After selection in G418 for 9 days, three successfully
targeted clones (4B9, 7C10, and 5G3) were identified by PCR and confirmed
by Southern blotting. C57BL/6 pseudopregnant mice were recipients of
blastocyst injections and embryo transfers. Four germ-line transmitting
chimeric mice were produced (three from clone 5G3 and one from clone
7C10). Heterozygous Tpmt (Tpmt +/ ) chimeric mice produced offspring in
the expected Mendelian distribution, indicating no in utero lethality due to
loss of one or both functional Tpmt alleles. Because C57BL/6 have low
constitutive TPMT activity (32, 33), the mixed background 129/C57BL/6
chimeric mice were backcrossed into constitutively high TPMT activity
strains (129P1/ReJ, NMRI, 129X1/SvJ, and C3H/HeJ) for five generations to
produce f97% strain purity. All strains were generated from 5G3 clones. In
addition, a strain of NMRI was also generated from clone 7C10. All
experiments involving the production and use of the Tpmt knockout mouse
described herein were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
Histologic evaluation. Histologic specimens were prepared from
6-month-old mice of both genders and three genotypes (Tpmt +/+, Tpmt +/ , and
and Tpmt / ) for screening of any pathologic changes associated with the
Tpmt-deficient genotype. All organs were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral
buffer formalin. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 Am) were visualized by H&E
staining.
TPMT activity. Blood (1 mL) was collected via heart puncture into tubes
containing sodium heparin. Erythrocyte lysates were prepared and analyzed
for TPMT activity by the nonchelated radiochemical assay of Szumlanski
et al. (34). The assay is based on the conversion of mercaptopurine to
radioactively labeled methylmercaptopurine with S-[methyl-14C]-adenosylL-methionine as the methyl donor.
De novo purine synthesis assay. Bone marrow cells were flushed from
femurs using PBS (pH 7.4), and the rate of de novo purine synthesis was
determined by a 2-h ex vivo incubation of 5  106 bone marrow cells with
[14C]formate (35).
Pharmacology studies. Mice from both genders, ages 8 to 13 weeks,
were used in the pharmacology studies. For pharmacokinetic studies,
mercaptopurine or thioguanine (50 mg/kg) was administered i.p., blood was
collected by heart puncture into heparinized tubes, and bone marrow cells
were obtained by flushing with PBS (pH 7.4).
To evaluate acute toxicity of thiopurines, mercaptopurine (100 mg/kg/d)
alone or thioguanine (5 mg/kg/d) alone was administered i.p. After 10 days
of treatment, complete blood counts and serum aspartate aminotransferase
levels were measured.

NMRI-5G3 [14.43 (13.40–15.70) versus 6.90 (6.50–7.30) versus 0.53
(0.40–0.60) units/mL erythrocytes; P = 0.0265], 129X1/SvJ [10.93 (9.70–12.90)
versus 7.13 (5.30–8.96) versus 0.53 (0.15–0.91) units/mL erythrocytes;
P = 0.0273], C3H/HeJ [15.3 (14.40–16.80) versus 8.23 (7.60–9.00) units/mL
erythrocytes versus undetectable; P = 0.0241]. TPMT activity was similar in
patient samples from children with leukemia [18.88 (12.75–25.98) versus 8.97
(3.90–13.45), versus 0.56 (0.37–0.75) units/mL erythrocytes (P < 0.0001) in
+/+, +/ , and / , respectively]. P values were determined by the
Kruskal-Wallis test.

To evaluate chronic toxicity that partially mimics the exposure conditions
of combination drug therapy given to children with leukemia, six mice of each
genotype (at 2 months of age) were placed on a folate-deficient (undetectable
folate) diet (Purina) because lymphoblastic leukemia therapy consists of
chronic antifolates. To mimic the fact that thiopurines are given nearly
continuously ( for many months), thiopurines were administered via the
drinking water. For chronic mercaptopurine experiments, the drinking water
contained mercaptopurine (0.01 mg/mL) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for the duration of the experiments to mimic the fact that children with
leukemia usually receive this antibiotic for the duration of their therapy.
Given the average oral water intake of these mice, the estimated average oral
intake of mercaptopurine was 2.5 mg/kg/d. Methotrexate was administered
i.p. at 1 mg/kg/wk beginning at 8 weeks of age, again to mimic the exposure of
children with leukemia that accompanies chronic thiopurine therapy.
Moribund mice were sacrificed. After 9 weeks of this regimen, the oral dose
of mercaptopurine in all of the surviving mice was doubled to 5 mg/kg/d.
Experiments for chronic toxicity after thioguanine were identical to those
described above, except that mercaptopurine was replaced by thioguanine,
at an estimated oral dose of 1 mg/kg/d. After 5 weeks of chemotherapy, the
oral dose of thioguanine was doubled to 2 mg/kg/d in the surviving mice.
To investigate the effect of a non-thiopurine drug in different Tpmt
genotypes, mice were treated with etoposide (100 mg/kg) by i.p. injection.
Complete blood counts were measured before and every 3 days after
treatment.
Thiopurine bases and nucleosides were measured by high-pressure liquid
chromatography in erythrocytes, plasma, and bone marrow cells before and
after conversion with acid phosphatase, as described (36, 37). Methylthioguanosine nucleotides were measured in erythrocytes using a
modification of a prior method (38).
Thiopurine pharmacology in children. To assess the extent to which
murine data mirrored clinical data, we measured erythrocyte TPMT activity,
thiopurine metabolites, and toxicity (assessed as the time-dependent
requirement for a thiopurine dose decrease in children treated for ALL,
as we reported; refs. 17, 39). All clinical studies were approved by our

Institutional Review Board. The clinical treatment protocol was one in
which 91% of the weeks of therapy consisted solely of mercaptopurine and
methotrexate. TPMT genotype was assessed directly by sequencing germline DNA or by inference based on erythrocyte TPMT activity (10, 40).
De novo purine synthesis was measured in bone marrow at diagnosis of
leukemia (35).
Statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity data are reported as
means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Differences in pharmacokinetic and toxicity variables among all three genotypes were compared
using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks. Where only two groups were
compared, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to calculate survival, and differences in survival among genotypes
were analyzed using the log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant for all analyses. All analyses were two sided.

Results
Homozygous deficient Tpmt (Tpmt / ) mice were viable, fertile,
and indistinguishable from their wild-type Tpmt (Tpmt +/+) or

heterozygous Tpmt (Tpmt +/ ) littermates by appearance; life span;
reproductive capacity; and histology of liver, lung, kidney, stomach,
duodenum, small and large intestine, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes,
heart, adrenals, reproductive organs, bone marrow, and brain.
TPMT activity. Mean erythrocyte TPMT activity differed among
Tpmt +/+, Tpmt +/ , and Tpmt / genotypes in five different strains
of Tpmt knockout mice (Fig. 1). The NMRI-5G3 strain was used for
all further experiments. The magnitude of differences in TPMT
activity among Tpmt genotypes in mice was similar to that
measured in 152 children with leukemia (Fig. 1; ref. 17).
Endogenous purines. To assess possible effects of TPMT in the
absence of exogenous thiopurine exposure, we documented that
the mean rate of de novo purine synthesis in bone marrow cells did
not differ among Tpmt +/+, Tpmt +/ , and Tpmt / genotypes
[3.00 (95% CI, 2.89–3.10), 3.44 (95% CI, 2.11–4.76), and 3.43 (95%
CI, 2.59–4.27) pmol newly synthesized purines/nmol unlabeled
purines/h, respectively; P = 0.35]. Likewise, the median rates of

de novo purine synthesis did not differ (P = 0.68) in bone marrow
leukemia cells obtained at diagnosis of B-lineage ALL among
105 children who were homozygous for wild-type TPMT (0.91;
95% CI, 5.10–5.82 pmol/nmol/h) compared with the 11 patients
with heterozygous TPMT genotype (0.88; 95% CI, 4.12–8.58 pmol/
nmol/h). Thus, targeted disruption of Tpmt did not have obvious
effects on purine homeostasis.
Pharmacokinetics. Thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) concentrations in bone marrow cytosol differed among Tpmt +/+, Tpmt +/ , and
and Tpmt / genotypes after treatment with both mercaptopurine
[3.24 (95% CI, 2.59–3.88), 3.58 (95% CI, 2.40–4.76), and 5.13 (95% CI,
3.84–6.42) pmol/5  106 cells, respectively; P = 0.044] and
thioguanine [99.7 (95% CI, 76.0–123), 143 (95% CI, 109–177), and
216 (95% CI, 158–274) pmol/5  106 cells, respectively; P = 0.002;
Fig. 2A]. We compared the Tpmt +/ genotype with both Tpmt +/+
and Tpmt / genotypes to evaluate whether there was an effect of
haploinsufficiency. After treatment with mercaptopurine, there
was no significant difference in TGN concentration in bone
marrow cytosol between Tpmt +/ and either Tpmt +/+ (P = 0.67) or
Tpmt / (P = 0.09) genotypes. After thioguanine treatment, the
difference in TGN concentration between Tpmt +/ and Tpmt +/+ did
not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07), but the difference
between Tpmt +/ and Tpmt / genotypes was significant
(P = 0.041). Consistent with clinical data (41, 42), the concentration
of TGNs was much higher after thioguanine than after mercaptopurine treatment [mean, 99.7 (95% CI, 76.0–123) versus 3.24 (95%
CI, 2.59–3.88) pmol/5  106 cells for Tpmt +/+ and 216 (95% CI,
158–274) versus 5.13 (95% CI, 3.84–6.42) pmol/5  106 cells for
Tpmt / mice, respectively].
After treatment with mercaptopurine (50 mg/kg), there was a
significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the erythrocyte concentration of methylthioinosine monophosphate (MeTIMP) among
genotypes, with Tpmt +/+ mice having the highest concentration
(mean, 1,104; 95% CI, 902–1,306 pmol/8  108 cells), Tpmt +/
mice having intermediate concentration (mean, 755; 95% CI, 568–
942 pmol/8  108 cells; P = 0.015), and Tpmt / mice having no
measurable MeTIMP (Fig. 2B). The methylated metabolites after
thioguanine (50 mg/kg) revealed a significant difference in the
erythrocyte methylthioguanine nucleotide (MeTGN) concentrations (P = 0.011) among the three genotypes, although the
difference between Tpmt +/+ and Tpmt +/ mice was not significant
[135 (95% CI, 66.0–204) versus 166 (95% CI, 72–259) pmol/8  108
cells, respectively; P = 0.34; Fig. 2B]. As has been observed in
patients (41), the concentration of the relevant methyl metabolites was much higher after mercaptopurine than after thioguanine treatment [mean, 1,104 (95% CI, 902–1,306) versus 135 (95%
CI, 66–204) pmol/8  108 cells among Tpmt +/+ mice, respectively].
Clinical pharmacokinetic data from patients undergoing treatment for ALL were similar to those obtained from the mice. The
mean levels of MeTIMP were 17,363 (95% CI, 14,543–20,184) versus
8,688 (95% CI, 1,244–18,619) versus 0.05 pmol/8  108 cells in
TPMT +/+, TPMT +/ , and TPMT / patients, respectively (P = 0.007;
Fig. 2B). Similarly, there was a significant difference among the
genotypes in the levels of TGNs: 2.61 (95% CI, 2.43–2.78) versus 6.02
(95% CI, 3.60–8.43) versus 22.28 (95% CI, 49.7–94.3) pmol/5  106
cells in TPMT +/+, TPMT +/ , and TPMT / patients, respectively
(P < 0.001; Fig. 2A).
Toxicity. After 10 days of treatment with mercaptopurine
(100 mg/kg/d i.p.) as a single agent, significant differences were
observed among the genotypes in survival, weight, complete blood
counts, and serum aspartate aminotransferase levels (Figs. 3 and 4).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

Heterozygotes had greater mean weight loss [ 9.22 (95% CI, 15.0
to 3.45) versus 1.26 (95% CI, 5.02 to 2.51) g; P = 0.025] and
more anemia [5.67 (95% CI, 4.48–6.85) versus 9.91 (95% CI, 7.73–
12.10) g/dL; P = 0.01] than Tpmt +/+ littermates. Heterozygotes also
had higher mean platelet counts [264 (95% CI, 174–299) versus 101
(95% CI, 70.7–131) 103/AL; P = 0.006], greater mean aspartate
aminotransferase levels [82.2 (95% CI, 66.5–97.8) versus 51.8 (95%
CI, 34.8–68.8) units/L; P = 0.023], and longer survival (P = 0.005)
than Tpmt / littermates. Thioguanine was more potent than
mercaptopurine; preliminary experiments with 50, 25, and 10 mg/
kg/d were all quite toxic to all three genotypes. At 5 mg/kg/d of
thioguanine i.p. as a single agent, all mice survived for the 10 days
of treatment with the exception of one Tpmt / mouse, but all
three genotypes experienced profound myelosuppression and there
were no differences in any of the hematologic variables measured
among the genotypes or in overall survival (Figs. 4 and 5). When
comparing Tpmt +/ with either Tpmt +/+ or Tpmt / genotype at
this dose, only platelet count [115 (95% CI, 88.8–140) versus
81.5 (95% CI, 62.9–100) 103/AL; P = 0.048] and percent weight
loss [ 3.46 (95% CI, 6.90 to 1.60) versus 22.5 (95% CI, 26.2
to 19.5) g; P = 0.014] differed significantly between Tpmt +/ and
Tpmt / genotypes, respectively. We tested an even lower dose
of thioguanine (2.5 mg/kg/d) and similarly found evidence of
myelosuppression in all genotypes. There was a significant

Thiopurine Effects in TPMT Murine Knockout Model

Myelosuppression (measured by the absolute neutrophil count,
hemoglobin, and platelet count) was significantly different among
Tpmt +/+, Tpmt +/ , and Tpmt / genotypes after the first 4 weeks of
chronic oral mercaptopurine combined with methotrexate (data
not shown). The poor survival rates precluded similar analyses with
chronic oral thioguanine/methotrexate treatment.
Hepatotoxicity is a known adverse effect of thiopurine therapy
(43–45). In contrast to myelosuppression after mercaptopurine, it
seems to occur more commonly among patients with high rather
than low TPMT activity (46, 47). In mice, after acute exposure to
mercaptopurine alone (100 mg/kg/d), serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were related to the number of wild-type copies of
Tpmt (P = 0.014; Fig. 3), with heterozygotes having higher
aminotransferase levels than Tpmt / mice [80.2 (95% CI, 56.2–
104) versus 51.8 (95% CI, 34.8–68.8) units/L, respectively; P = 0.022].
A similar relationship to hepatotoxicity was observed after chronic
exposure to 8 weeks of oral mercaptopurine combined with
methotrexate, with aspartate aminotransferase levels higher in
Tpmt +/+ than in Tpmt +/ littermates [126 (95% CI, 103–148) versus
91.17 (95% CI, 60.94–121.39) units/L, respectively; P = 0.045]; no
Tpmt / mice survived to this time point. Interestingly, mean
aspartate aminotransferase levels did not differ among genotypes
after 10 days of thioguanine [67.00 (95% CI, 42.57–91.43), 60.6
(95% CI, 30.52–90.68), and 62.25 (95% CI, 25.17–99.33) units/L in

were determined by the log-rank test.

difference, however, in all complete blood count variables
measured as well as in percent weight loss when comparing
Tpmt +/ and Tpmt / genotypes, with Tpmt / mice being more
profoundly affected (data not shown).
Thiopurines are often administered chronically as daily oral
doses and combined with weekly methotrexate to treat ALL. We
assessed the effects of chronic exposure by treating mice with daily
oral mercaptopurine (2.5 mg/kg/d) or thioguanine (1 mg/kg/d)
combined with weekly i.p. methotrexate (1 mg/kg). For both
thiopurines, all of the / mice were sacrificed due to toxicity
after 4 to 8 weeks, with little toxicity observed in the +/ and +/+
mice. Therefore, to hasten the onset and to increase the probability
of toxicity in the surviving mice, the mercaptopurine dose was
increased from 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/d beginning at 9 weeks, and the
thioguanine dose was increased from 1 to 2 mg/kg/d at 5 weeks,
leaving the methotrexate and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
doses unchanged. In this setting, survival of Tpmt / mice was
0% at 8 weeks following mercaptopurine and 0% at 4 weeks
following thioguanine treatment, both being significantly lower
than their respective Tpmt +/ or Tpmt +/+ littermates (Fig. 6). The
doses of thiopurines were increased at 9 and 5 weeks for
mercaptopurine and thioguanine, respectively, and there was no
difference in survival in Tpmt +/ compared with Tpmt +/+ mice for
either the former (P = 0.66) or the latter (P = 0.44) drug.

Discussion
We created a murine model that recapitulates all the known
elements of the human genetic polymorphism in TPMT. This
model therefore allowed us to address fundamental questions
about the effects of TPMT on thiopurine dosing.
When thiopurines are used to treat cancer, they are almost always
used in a multidrug context. Because of overlapping toxicities
among anticancer drugs, it is often not possible to discern which
agent is the primary culprit causing myelosuppression using a trial-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

and-error approach in the clinic. Therefore, the diagnosis of a defect
in TPMT can serve as a clinically useful basis on which to target
thiopurines as the likely cause of myelosuppression in the setting of
multiagent chemotherapy. The clinical data supporting an
increased risk of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression associated
with the relatively rare homozygous deficiency are strong, with a
>10-fold dosage reduction required in such patients (44). Our
murine data are consistent with a dramatic effect of homozygous
defects of TPMT. The magnitude of the effect of heterozygosity and
its implications for dose reductions clinically are less clear (17).
Herein, with acute administration of thiopurines alone, we showed
that heterozygosity affects mercaptopurine-induced myelosuppression (Fig. 3), but haploinsufficiency was more difficult to show after
thioguanine treatment (Fig. 5). With chronic thiopurine exposures,
and in the presence of methotrexate (mimicking the clinical
regimen used for treatment of ALL), toxicity after mercaptopurine
was only slightly greater in Tpmt +/ mice than in Tpmt +/+ mice

(Fig. 6), and after thioguanine was indistinguishable between
Tpmt +/ and Tpmt +/+ mice (Fig. 6).
The Tpmt activity differences among the genotypic groups were
identical to those observed in patients (Fig. 1) and clear evidence
for haploinsufficiency was conferred by heterozygosity, as is true
in humans (40). Thus, the model seems to be suitable for
addressing thiopurine questions that cannot be feasibly tested in
humans. Our data indicate that toxicity differences among
patients of differing TPMT genotypes are likely due to differences
in metabolism of thiopurines and not to any underlying
susceptibility caused by TPMT variation. There was no evident
phenotype produced by abrogation of the Tpmt gene in the
absence of drug challenge. In this regard, we tested for more
subtle biochemical effects of Tpmt deficiency by measuring
constitutive levels of de novo purine synthesis and found no
difference among the Tpmt +/+, Tpmt +/ , or Tpmt / genotypes.
Because TPMT uses S-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor, which
plays a crucial role in purine and pyrimidine homeostasis, these
findings indicate that TPMT is unlikely to play an important role
in endogenous purine synthesis. Moreover, as expected, there
were no differences in toxicity among genotypes after treatment
with etoposide, an agent that is not metabolized by TPMT.
Methylated active metabolites of mercaptopurine (MeTIMP)
differed among Tpmt genotypes, mirroring the differences observed
among patients (Fig. 2B). MeTIMP concentrations are much higher,
relative to dose or to active TGN metabolites, following mercaptopurine than are the analogous methylated metabolites (MeTGN)
after thioguanine (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, haploinsufficiency was not
evident for production of MeTGN after thioguanine as it was for
production of MeTIMP after mercaptopurine (Fig. 2B), which is
consistent with haploinsufficiency being more evident for toxicity
after mercaptopurine than thioguanine. Active TGN metabolites
differed by Tpmt genotype after mercaptopurine and after
thioguanine, as was anticipated from clinical data (41).
In humans, thioguanine and mercaptopurine show substantially
different pharmacologic profiles, despite sharing common TGN
metabolites. Mercaptopurine is more subject to methylation to
both the inactive base and the active MeTIMP than is thioguanine,
for which anabolism to TGNs plays a greater quantitative role. The

difficulty in discerning acute toxicity differences among TPMT
genotypic groups with thioguanine alone may be partly because
it was difficult to find a dose low enough that was not toxic in all
three genotypes; however, it is consistent with the extensive TGN
formation after thioguanine compared with mercaptopurine.
Thiopurines are associated with hepatotoxicity; hepatic transaminase elevations have been related to MeTIMP concentrations
after mercaptopurine (48) whereas hepatic veno-occlusive disease is
more common after thioguanine than mercaptopurine and seems
to be dose related (49). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis
that TPMT may contribute to hepatocellular toxicity via methylation of mercaptopurine metabolites (43, 45, 50) but does not relate
to thioguanine hepatotoxicity: we did not observe transaminasemia
after thioguanine regardless of Tpmt genotype. The clinical hepatic
toxicity due to thioguanine is likely due to an independent
mechanism. At necropsy, no hepatic pathology was observed after
thioguanine treatment with the regimens used herein.
In summary, the targeted disruption of the Tpmt gene
recapitulates the essential elements of the human pharmacogenetic polymorphism, both pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically, but the model also further differentiates specific adverse
and pharmacologic effects of thioguanine versus mercaptopurine.
Such murine models of human germ-line genetic variability provide
a laboratory basis for the systematic optimization of dosages of
anticancer medications.
