ABSTRACT
HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer patients frequently develop resistance
to trastuzumab through mechanisms still poorly understood. In breast cancer, other
members of the HER-family are known to be involved in trastuzumab-resistance, as is
overexpression of the scaffold protein IQGAP1. In the present work, we investigated
acquired resistance to trastuzumab in gastric cancer experimental models.
Trastuzumab-resistant (HR) subclones derived from 3 HER2-overexpressing gastric
cancer cells were generated and characterized for alterations in HER2- signaling
mechanisms by next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemical, western blot
and qRT-PCR techniques, and molecular modeling analysis. All subclones showed
a reduced growth rate with respect to parental cell lines but each had a different
resistance mechanism. In NCI N87 HR cells, characterized by a marked increase
in HER2-signaling pathways with respect to the parental cell line, trastuzumab
sensitivity was restored when IQGAP1 expression was silenced. AKG HR subclone
showed higher HER3 protein expression than the parental line. High nuclear HER4
levels were observed in KKP HR cells. In conclusion, our study revealed that high
IQGAP1 expression leads to resistance to trastuzumab in gastric cancer. Furthermore,
2 new mutations of the HER2 gene that may be involved in acquired resistance were
identified in AKG HR and KKP HR subclones.

overall response rate and 6 to 12-month median survival
[5–7]. Thus, various combination regimens have been
developed.
Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and
inhibits HER2-mediated signaling by binding the
extracellular domain of HER2. Amplification of the
HER2 gene is observed in 20%-30% of gastric and
gastroesophageal junction cancer [8–12] and is indicative
of a poor prognosis, as recently highlighted in the
systematic meta-analysis by Jorgensen et al. [13]. In
2010, the phase III ToGA trial showed the superiority of
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (based on a cisplatin-

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is the fourth most common
malignant disease and the second leading cause of
cancer-related death worldwide [1]. In Europe, it is the
fifth most common cancer among men and women,
representing about 23% of all cancers. Depending on
tumor characteristics and stage [2], treatment modalities
include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy generally
based upon a platinum-fluoropyrimidine doublet, and
radiation therapy [3, 4]. Although fluorouracil (5-FU)based regimens have proven feasible and effective in
the treatment of solid tumors, their therapeutic effect is
unsatisfactory in advanced gastric cancer, i.e., 7-51%

fluoropyrimidine doublet) in patients with HER2-positive
metastatic gastric cancer over chemotherapy alone in
terms of response rate, progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) [14]. These results led to the
approval of trastuzumab as the first molecular targeted
therapy for gastric cancer. However, subsequent clinical
trials (TYTAN8 and LOGiC9) failed to show a survival
advantage with the use of another anti-HER2 treatment,
lapatinib [15]. Overall, the efficacy of HER2-targeted
agents has proven more limited and unsatisfactory than
originally expected because the majority of patients with
gastric cancer develop acquire resistance to treatment [16].
In particular, it has been observed that, whilst few patients
with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer exhibit
primary resistance to trastuzumab, all acquire resistance
after a relatively short period of time (median PFS 6.7
months) [17], as already observed in HER2-positive
breast cancer patients. The identification of mechanisms
underlying treatment resistance would thus enhance the
benefit from HER2-targeted therapy in patients with
HER2-positive gastric cancer.
The etiology of resistance to HER2-directed
therapies has been widely investigated in breast cancer
[18–22]. Several molecular mechanisms underlying
acquired resistance to HER-2 inhibitors have been
described, including the activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase
[20], HER3 upregulation [23], activating mutations in the
p110a subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) [24], and enhanced
HER-ligand autocrine signaling [25]. It has also been
proven that resistance to HER2-targeted therapy can
trigger genetic alterations of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs), leading to the activation of downstream signaling
targets and alternative pathways to compensate for HER2 inhibition [26, 27]. Numerous studies have concluded
that induction of the HER3 pathway is one of the reasons
underlying this type of resistance [28–30]. Moreover,
Mohd Nafi et al. observed that HER4 activation,
cleavage and nuclear translocation influence sensitivity
and resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast
cancer [31].
A recent study reported that IQGAP1, a scaffold
protein of 189-kDa ubiquitously expressed in all human
tissues, governs HER2 expression, phosphorylation
and signaling in breast cancer cell lines [32]. Moreover,
IQGAP1 protein is overexpressed in squamous cell [33]
and hepatocellular [34] carcinoma, astrocytoma [35],
and aggressive forms of gastric cancer [36]. In particular,
White et al. [37] showed that IQGAP1overexpression
is correlated with trastuzumab-induced resistance in
breast cancer cell lines. However, its involvement in
resistance to trastuzumab in gastric cancer has never
been investigated. In the present work we investigated
mechanisms of resistance induced by trastuzumab in
in vitro experimental gastric cancer cell lines rendered
resistant to the antiproliferative effect of the drug.

Baseline expression and mutational status
of HER2, -3 and -4 receptors in a panel of
established human gastric cancer cell lines
Positivity to HER2, -3 and -4 proteins and
their cellular localization in the human gastric cell
lines NCI N87, AKG and KKP was assessed by
immunohistochemistry (Figure 1A). HER2, -3 and -4
receptors were highly expressed in all 3 cell lines, albeit
with a different diffusion pattern. In particular, HER2
was highly expressed in NCI N87 with a diffuse plasma
membrane and cytosolic staining pattern. HER3 was also
highly expressed in NCI N87 cells (~95% of positive
cells) in both the plasma membrane and cytosol. In
addition, HER3 was expressed in KKP and AKG cells,
albeit to a lesser degree (~40% and ~30% of positive cells,
respectively), whereas its staining pattern was mainly
restricted to the cytosol. Finally, HER4 protein was mainly
localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm of AKG cells.
We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to
search for genomic alterations that might predispose
to a different response to treatment with trastuzumab
(average depth of 2779.73 and 99.7% of targets with a
minimum coverage of 50). We first investigated whether
the different cell lines harbored genetic alterations of
HER2, HER3 or HER4 genes and which, if any, were
common to AKG, KKP and NCI N87 (Figure  1B).
All 3 cell lines showed several alterations in the gene
sequences investigated, only 12 of which are not
annotated in the dbSNP and COSMIC databases. In
particular, 4 of these were exonic variants (Tables 1
and 2). Notably, only 5 gene variants were common to all
3 lines, i.e. HER3 variants c.-211delCT and c. C2270A;
and HER4 variants IVS17-60delAG, IVS17-102insG
and IVS7-7delT (Figure 1B and Table 1).
A pairwise comparison of the 3 cell lines revealed
that AKG and KKP cell lines shared the highest number
of gene alterations, one in HER2, 2 in HER3 and one in
HER4 (Table 1). Conversely, NCI N87 showed the highest
number of genetic variants (13) relating to all 3 HER
receptors (5 variants in HER2, 3 in HER3 and 5 in HER4)
that were not found in AKG or KKP (Table 2).

Generation of trastuzumab-resistant subclones
All of the cell lines were sensitive to trastuzumab,
as confirmed by the clonogenic assay in which IC50 values
were lower than the peak plasma concentration of the
drug (Figure 2A). In particular, NCI N87, the cell line
harboring the highest number of HER2 variants, was
the most sensitive to the cytotoxic action of trastuzumab
(IC50 value of 7 μg/ml), whereas the AKG cells (3 gene
variants) were the most resistant (IC50 = 40 μg/ml). The

incorporation of BrdU after a 72-h treatment with the
drug confirmed these data. In fact, after treatment with
100 μg/ml of trastuzumab, NCI N87 showed a lower
incorporation of BrdU than that of untreated cells (35%
and 42%, respectively), while no substantial change in cell
proliferation was seen in AKG (Figure 2B).
We
generated
trastuzumab-resistant
(HR)
subclones derived from the above gastric cancer cell
lines to investigate the mechanisms underlying acquired
resistance to trastuzumab. Starting from the peak plasma
concentration of 100 μg/ml, all cell lines were exposed
to gradually increasing concentrations of trastuzumab for
a period of 8-12 months. We thus obtained trastuzumabresistant subclones that were capable of growing in culture
medium containing a drug concentration of 250 μg/ml for
the NCI N87 HR subclone and 400 μg/ml for the AKG HR
and KKP HR subclones (Figure 2C).
The resistant phenotype was stable and all
subclones showed IC50 values higher than the peak plasma
concentration of the drug ranging from 120 μg/ml (AKG
HR) to 200 μg/ml (KKP HR and NCI N87 HR) (Figure
2C). We also evaluated the relative resistance IC50 index
(RR IC50) of each subclone obtained (Figure 2D). Notably,
the data revealed that the subclone with the highest RR
IC50 value, NCI N87 HR, was obtained from the cell line
with the highest number of genetic variants. In addition,
trastuzumab was found to stimulate proliferation in all
subclones, significantly so for NCI N87 HR cells (p<0.05)
(Figure 2E).

We also observed changes in doubling times that
were cell line-dependent (Figure 2F), e.g. AKG HR cells
grew more rapidly, albeit not significantly, than those of
the parental line. KKP and its subclone KKP HR showed
similar growth, while NCI N87 HR grew significantly
slower than its parental line (p<0.05).
The resistant subclone of NCI N87 displayed a
different cell distribution in cell cycle phases compared to
parental cells. In particular, an increase of cells in G0/G1
phase was observed in NCI-N87 HR (84.0%) compared
to NCI N87 cells (69.63%), whereas a lower percentage
of S-phase cells was found in the HR subclone than in the
parental line (11.02% NCI N87 HR vs. 24.17% NCI N87)
(Figure 2G).

Different HER2 signaling modulation in HR
subclones
We quantified HER2 expression levels by flow
cytometry and western blot analysis to verify whether
its expression was modified in HR subclones (Figure 3).
Flow cytometric analysis revealed an increase in
HER2 membrane levels in NCI N87 HR cells with
respect to parental cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
immunohistochemistry analysis showed that HER2 was
highly expressed in NCI N87 HR cells (~95% positive
cells) which had both membrane and a cytoplasmic
positivity (Figure 3B). We also detected a marked
increase in p-HER2, AKT, p-AKT and MAPK protein

into NCI N87 HR cells, the subclone with the highest drug
resistance phenotype (also confirmed by its RR value).
Gene silencing induced a total block in protein synthesis
and a dramatic decrease (up to 90%) in mRNA expression
(Figure 4B). IQGAP1-silenced NCI N87 HR cells exposed
to different concentrations of trastuzumab for 144 h
regained a certain degree of sensitivity to trastuzumab,
reaching an IC50 value of 110 μg/ml. Furthermore, the RR
decreased from 28.57 to 15.71, indicating an increase in
sensitivity to trastuzumab (Figure 4C). These data were
further supported by the results from a colony formation
assay showing a reduction of about 55% in the number of
colonies when IQGAP1-silenced NCI N87 HR cells were
exposed to trastuzumab 100 μg/ml for 14 days.

Knockdown of IQGAP1 inhibits HER2stimulated NCI-N87 HR cell growth
IQGAP1 gene and protein expression were analyzed
in all cell lines to verify their involvement in trastuzumabrelated resistance (Figure 4). A different modulation
of the protein was observed in the 3 parental cell lines,
AKG cells showing the highest IQGAP1 expression and
KKP the lowest (Figure 4A). This expression pattern
was confirmed by gene expression analysis (data not
shown). We also observed an increase in IQGAP1 protein
expression of HR-resistant subclones with respect to
parental cells (p<0.05). However, trastuzumab-resistant
NCI N87 cells were the only subclones to show an
increase in IQGAP1 gene expression levels with respect
to parental cells (expression value 2.5-fold higher than that
of NCI N87).

Protein expression detected by western blot revealed
increased HER3 and decreased HER4 protein levels
in AKG HR cells compared to parental cells. KKP HR
subclone showed higher levels of HER4 than KKP
cells. Finally, NCI N87 HR only showed significantly
lower HER4 expression than parental cells (Figure 5A).
HER3 was also highly expressed in about 95% of AKG
HR cells, with cytoplasmic positivity. Furthermore,

DISCUSSION

cascade that modulates cancer cell survival, proliferation,
mobility and invasiveness [41].
The main aim of our work was to investigate
resistance mechanisms to trastuzumab in preclinical
models of human gastric cancer. For this purpose we
created trastuzumab resistant subclones starting from 3
HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines (AKG,
KKP and NCI-N87 cells) with a high sensitivity to
trastuzumab. These lines also expressed other HER family
receptor members and showed genetic variants of HER2,
HER3 and HER4.
After 8-12 months’ exposure to increasing
concentrations of trastuzumab, we successfully obtained
trastuzumab-resistant AKG HR, KKP HR and NCI N87
HR subclones that grew in culture medium supplemented
with high concentrations of the drug (up to 400 μg/

In gastric cancer patients, HER2/neu gene
expression is an independent prognostic factor, and
overexpression of the HER2 protein is correlated with
poor prognosis and short-term survival [38, 39]. The
effectiveness of trastuzumab and its subsequent approval
as first-line treatment for HER2-overexpressing metastatic
gastric cancer confirmed the importance of this receptor
in gastric cancer. However, as already observed in other
tumors, the majority of patients who initially show
sensitivity to trastuzumab develop resistance within one
year [17]. Aberrant HER2 activity and the activation
of the HER2 receptor in human gastric tumors leads to
receptor heterodimerization, mainly with HER3 and HER4
receptors [40], triggering a complex signal transduction

ml). Cell growth curves, BrdU incorporation and cell
cycle analyses revealed that the biological features of
trastuzumab-resistant cells differed from those of parental
cells. In particular, the NCI N87 HR subclone grew more
slowly, had a lower proliferative activity and showed a
higher percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase and a lower
percentage in S phase than NCI N87 cells. Similar results
were reported by Zou et al. [42] who were the first group
to obtain a trastuzumab-resistant subclone of NCI-N87
(N87 NCI/TR). In addition, our flow cytometry analyses
revealed an increase in membrane HER2 levels only in the
NCI N87 HR subclone with respect to its parental cells.
We also detected a marked increase in p-HER2, AKT,
p-AKT and MAPK protein levels and a reduction in p27
protein expression in NCI N87 HR cells. These results
are in agreement with those from previous studies in
which trastuzumab was reported to inhibit HER2+ tumor
growth by stimulating endocytosis and degradation of
the receptor, with subsequent impairment of downstream
signaling through PI3K/AKT and MAPK cascades [43]. It
was also recently reported that increased PI3K/AKT and
MAPK cascade signaling inhibits p27 expression [43–46].
White et al. revealed that IQGAP1 governs
trastuzumab function in HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer. In particular, they reported that, in IQGAP1silenced breast cancer cells, trastuzumab increased
its capacity to decrease HER2 expression and HER2stimulated activation of the PI3K/AKT cascade [37].

In the present work we showed that IQGAP1
knockdown in gastric cancer leads to the abrogation of
trastuzumab resistance and to restored drug sensitivity.
In particular, IQGAP1 protein levels in all trastuzumab
resistant subclones were higher than those of parental cells,
although no genetic variants were detected in the different
cell lines used. However, the restoral of trastuzumab
sensitivity through IQGAP1 silencing was only observed
in NCI N87 HR cells which showed a strong activation of
PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling cascades, both features
of IQGAP1-mediated trastuzumab resistance [37].
Multiple factors influence the resistance to
molecular-targeting drugs and several studies have
hypothesized that acquired resistance to trastuzumab
might also be due to the alteration of the signaling cascade
induced by HER3 and HER4 receptors [20, 23, 24]. Our
models showed high levels of both receptors. In particular,
AKG HR cell line expressed higher protein levels of HER3
than the parental line, mainly in the cell membrane. This
finding is in agreement with data reported by Ma et al. [47]
who considered HER3 overexpression to be a mechanism
of resistance to trastuzumab. Increased HER3 expression
also appears to promote both PI-3 K7Akt signaling and Scr
kinase activity [48]. In our study, KKP HR cells expressed
high levels of nuclear HER4, confirming recent findings
about the involvement of HER4, especially in terms of its
activation, cleavage and nuclear translocation, in resistance
to trastuzumab in breast cancer cell lines [31, 49].

We also investigated the presence of genetic
variants potentially involved in acquired trastuzumab
resistance. No genetic variants of the IQGAP1 gene were
found in any of the studied cell lines. Furthermore, NGS
analysis revealed that the resistant clone NCI N87 HR
did not acquire additional gene variants with respect to
the parental line. Conversely, KKP HR and AKG HR
acquired one and two genetic variants, respectively,
compared to their parental cell lines, and all were located
in the C-terminal lobe of HER2, in a portion of the
molecule called αF-helix. αF-helix, a highly hydrophobic
component located in the middle of the C-lobe, plays
a central role in anchoring key hydrophobic motifs.
In particular, it forms the base of C- and R-spines, two
motifs previously described by Kornev et al., [50, 51]
which coordinate the N- and C-lobe movements of the
kinase domain in the active conformation of the protein
[52]. Given that both motifs are highly conserved through
different types of active protein kinases, the assembly

and anchorage of the spines to αF helix could be an
important regulatory element. Furthermore, the activation
loop, another important portion of the kinase domain, is
firmly anchored to the hydrophobic αF helix. This is the
most flexible part of the activation segment and requires
phosphorylation to activate and increase the enzymatic
activity of protein kinases, including ErbB family
members [53, 54]. The genetic variants detected by our
NGS analysis have never been reported before and may
serve to maintain the active conformation of the HER2
receptor.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence of
the existence of different mechanisms of resistance to
trastuzumab in human gastric cancer. We also discovered
that IQGAP1 is involved in trastuzumab resistance in
gastric cancer cell lines and identified 2 new mutations
of the HER2 gene that may be correlated with acquired
resistance to the drug. Further studies are needed to
explore these issues.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

anti-human antibodies for HER3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) and HER4 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) were used
at a dilution of 1:250. Mouse monoclonal anti-human
antibody for HER2 (Dako Corporation, Carpenteria, CA,
USA) was used at a dilution of 1:100. Antibodies were
incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Slides were
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), incubated
with a universal biotinylated secondary antibody for 15
min and rinsed in PBS. They were then incubated with
streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (LSAB + Kit; Dako
Corporation) for 15 min. Slides were rinsed again in
PBS and antibody binding was detected by staining
with diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxidase chromogen
solution (DAB + liquid substrate–chromogen solution;
Dako Corporation). Finally, the sections were rinsed in
deionized water, counterstained by Mayer’s hematoxylin,
and mounted by Eukitt (Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy). Sample
reactivity was evaluated by light microscopy (× 200)
by two independent observers. Marker positivity was
evaluated semi-quantitatively. Staining was evaluated
in terms of the localization (nuclear, cytoplasmatic and
membrane) of the selected proteins and the percentage of
positive cells.

Cell lines
The study was performed on two cell lines (AKG,
KKP) derived from human gastric adenocarcinoma
(intestinal type), established and characterized in our
laboratory [55, 56], and one commercial cell line obtained
from a liver metastasis of a well differentiated gastric
carcinoma (NCI-N87) and purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).
Cell lines were maintained as a monolayer at 37°C and
subcultured weekly. The culture medium was composed
of DMEM/Ham’s F12 (1:1) supplemented with fetal calf
serum (10%), glutamine (2 mM), non-essential amino
acids (1%) (Mascia Brunelli S.p.A., Milan, Italy), and
insulin (10 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Cells were used in the exponential growth phase in all
experiments.

Doubling time
For growth analysis, cells were plated in 12-well
plates in triplicate at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/
well. Cells were collected and counted for the first 7 days
after plating. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) was purchased by
the Oncology Pharmacy of our institute (IRST IRCCS).
Proliferation doubling time was determined by the
following formula: log2 (Cv/Cs), where Cv is the number
of viable cells at harvest and Cs is the number of cells
seeded. The sum of all previous population doublings
determined the cumulative population doubling level at
each passage. The Trypan blue exclusion test was used
to evaluate the percentage of viable cells, which always
exceeded 98% for the duration of the experiments.

Clonogenic assay
Following a 72-h exposure to trastuzumab, 500 cells
were seeded in 10-cm2 dishes in 500 ml of medium. After
14 days, the resulting colonies were fixed and stained using
0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol; colonies with more
than 50 cells were quantified under inverted microscope
(Olympus IX51 microscope, Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) by two independent observers. Five series
of samples were prepared for each treatment dose [57].

Generation of trastuzumab-resistant subclones

Cytofluorimetric analysis

We induce trastuzumab resistance by culturing
trastuzumab-sensitive gastric cancer cell lines in the
presence of progressively increasing doses of trastuzumab
over a period of 12 months. The final concentration of
trastuzumab used was 250 μg/ml for the trastuzumabresistant subclone NCI-N87 HR and 400 μg/ml for the
subclones AKG HR and KKP HR.

Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a
FACS Canto flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San
Diego, CA, USA) equipped with 488 nm (blue) and 633
(red) lasers. Data acquisition and analysis were performed
using FACSDiva (Becton Dickinson) and ModFit 2.0
(DNA Modelling System, Verity Software House, Inc.,
Topsham, ME, USA). Samples were run in triplicate and
10,000 events were collected for each replica. Data were
the average of three experiments, with errors under 5%.

Immunohistochemistry
Cells were seeded in sterile culture slides (BD,
Falcon, New Jersey, USA) and cultured in a humidified
CO2 incubator for 72 h. They were then fixed in 4% (v/v)
paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked for endogenous
peroxidase activity with a 3% hydrogen peroxide
solution. Antigen unmasking was performed using citrate
buffer pH 6 for 40 min at 98.5°C. Rabbit monoclonal

Cell cycle distribution
After exposure to trastuzumab, cells were fixed
in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide (10 mg/
ml, MP Biomedicals, Verona, Italy), RNAse (10 kunits/
ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and NP40 (0.01%, Sigma Aldrich)
overnight at 37C° in the dark, and analyzed by flow

cytometry. Data were expressed as fractions of cells in the
different cycle phases.

Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using
TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT)
reactions were performed using an iScript TM cDNA
Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). mRNA expression
was analyzed by quantitative Real-Time PCR using the
7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following TaqMan assays
(Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
used: IQGAP1 (Hs00896595_m1) and its relative gene
expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH Hs03929097_g1) and β2microglobulin (Hs00984230_m1). Data showed the
average of triplicates ± standard deviation (SD) and were
representative of three independent experiments.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay
After treatment with trastuzumab100 μg/ml, the
cell culture medium was supplemented with 60 μM of
BrdU and incubated for an additional 5 h. At the end of
the incubation time, cells were fixed, incubated for 25
min with 2M of HCL and then washed with borax 0.1
M. Samples were incubated with anti-BrdU antibody
1:1000 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min. After incubation
with FITC-conjugated antibody (goat anti-mouse 1:250,
Dako Corporation), cells were stained with 5 mg/ml of
propidium iodide for 2 h at 4°C before flow cytometry
acquisition.

Immunophenotypic analysis

DNA extraction and next-generation
sequencing (NGS)

Cells were fixed and immunophenotyping was
performed using anti-HER2 (1:100) (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies, Monza, Italy) antibody for 30 min at 4°C.
After three washes, cells were incubated with RPEconjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody 1:250 (Invitrogen)
for 60 min in the dark. Appropriate isotype control was
included for each sample.

Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp
DNA MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per the
manufacturer’s protocol. DNA quality was evaluated
with High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit on Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and
quantified using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen).
DNA from these cell lines was subjected to target
sequencing using a custom panel purchased from Agilent
Technologies.
Sequences were achieved by designing primers to
capture the entire coding region, exon-intron boundaries
(±10 bp) and the promoter region of 4 genes using the
Agilent HaloPlex Target Enrichment System (Table  3).
Quantified libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq
platform (San Diego, CA, USA) using 2 X 151 bp in pairend mode and run on an Illumina V2 sequencing flow cell.
Raw demultiplexed reads from MiSeq sequencer
were aligned against the human reference genome hg19
with BWA MEM [60]. GATK version 3.2.2 was used
to recalibrate base qualities and realign aligned reads
around indels [61]. Regions with coverage of less than or
equal to 200x were discarded for downstream analyses.
Somatic variant analysis was used to detect mutations:
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified using
MuTect version 1.1.7 with standard parameters, and
GATK IndelGenotyperV2 (with minFraction = 0.01 and
minCnt = 5) was used to detect Indels. Genomic and
functional annotation of detected variants was made by
Annovar [62, 63]. Coverage statistics were performed by
Depth of Coverage utility of GATK. BASH and R custom
scripts were used to obtain the list of low coverage (200X)
regions per sample.
Sequencing runs produced a total of 36,646,538
reads, of which 94.6% mapped on the hg19 human

Western blot
Cells were treated according to the previously
described western blot procedure [58]. The following
primary antibodies were used: anti-IQGAP1 (1:400), antiHER2 (1:800) (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific);
anti-actin (1:1000) (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-HER4 (1:1000)
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-vinculin (1:1000) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific); anti-p27 (1:1000) (BD Biosciences,
Milan, Italy); anti-HER3 (1:1000), anti-PTEN (1:1000),
anti-mTOR (1:600), anti-MAPK (1:1000), anti-AKT
(1:1000), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (1:1000) and antiphospho-HER2 (Tyr1221/1222) (1:1000) (Cell Signaling
Technology). Precision Plus Protein™ WesternC™
Standards were used as molecular weight standards (BioRad #161-0376). Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad) was
used for analysis.

Small interfering RNA transfection
Silencer® Select Validated siRNA (Ambion,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) was utilized for IQGAP1 silencing.
A validated Universal Negative ControlTM (Invitrogen)
was used as a control for transfection. The siRNA
oligonucleotide showing the highest knockdown efficiency
of IQGAP1 mRNA in the NCIN87cell line was used for
the experiments. Cells were treated according to the
previously described procedure [59]. Cells were treated
after 72 h.
