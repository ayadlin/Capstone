ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in drug resistance and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). The aims of this study were to explore the potential
role of miR-206 in governing cisplatin resistance and EMT in lung cancer cells. We
found that both lung adenocarcinoma A549 cisplatin-resistant cells (A549/DDP) and
H1299 cisplatin-resistant cells (H1299/DDP) acquired mesenchymal features and
were along with low expression of miR-206 and high migration and invasion abilities.
Ectopic expression of miR-206 mimics inhibited cisplatin resistance, reversed the
EMT phenotype, decreased the migration and invasion in these DDP-resistant cells.
In contrast, miR-206 inhibitors increased cisplatin resistance, EMT, cell migration
and invasion in non-DDP-resistant cells. Furthermore, we found that MET is the direct
target of miR-206 in lung cancer cells. Knockdown of MET exhibited an EMT and
DDP resistant inhibitory effect on DDP-resistant cells. Conversely, overexpression
of MET in non-DDP- resistant cells produced a promoting effect on cell EMT and DDP
resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma tissues, we demonstrated that low expression of
miR-206 were also correlated with increased cisplatin resistance and MET expression.
In addition, we revealed that miR-206 overexpression reduced cisplatin resistance
and EMT in DDP-resistant cells, partly due to inactivation of MET/PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway, and subsequent downregulation of MDR1, ZEB1 and Snail
expression. Finally, we found that miR-206 could also sensitize A549/DDP cells to
cisplatin in mice model. Taken together, our study implied that activation of miR-206
or inactivation of its target gene pathway could serve as a novel approach to reverse
cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinomas cells.

such as high efficiency, mild side effects and easy
administration. However, cisplatin resistance often
occurs in clinical practice [2]. Thus, adjuvant therapy
to enhance cisplatin efficiency becomes an important
chemotherapeutic strategy.
Accumulating studies indicate that there are several
major mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer cells,
such as increased detoxification of anticancer drugs by
glutathione system, defective apoptosis pathway, increased
levels of DNA repair or DNA tolerance, decreased uptake
of water-soluble drugs and enhanced drug efflux from

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, predominantly non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide. Patients with NSCLC are mostly
treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in combination
with radiation therapy. However, the development of
chemoresistance, either intrinsic or acquired, is a major
obstacle limiting successful treatment [1]. Cisplatin (DDP)
is still one of the commonly used chemotherapeutic agents
against lung cancer due to its therapeutic advantages,

cancer cells mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters[3–5]. Several studies showed that the drugresistant cancer cells display features of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), which is defined by the
loss of intracellular links along with the gain of migratory
and invasive abilities [6, 7]. Specifically, cells with
decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin
and increased expression of mesenchymal molecules
including Snail/Snai1, Slug/Snai2, Vimentin, zinc-finger
E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), lead to enhanced
motility, invasion and drug resistance[8]. In addition,
PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling has also found to confer resistance to DDP-based
treatment in many cancers [9, 10]. Furthermore, it has
been reported that there exist a cross-talk between EMT
programming and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [11].
The microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small
non-coding RNAs. The basic mechanism of miRNA
action is that miRNA could bind to the 3'UTR of target
mRNAs, resulting in translational repression or target
mRNA cleavage[12]. Recent studies suggested that the
acquisition of drug resistance by cancer cells might be
modulated via the changes in miRNA levels[13, 14].
For instance, miR-135a/b are downregulated in cisplatin
resistance (A549/DDP) cells, and the overexpression of
miR-135a/b sensitizes A549/DDP cells to cisplatin by
targeting MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) [15]. Upregulation of miR-27a can suppress RKIP (Raf kinase
inhibitory protein) expression and in turn contribute
to chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to
cisplatin[16]. Upregulation of miR-451 expression
inactivates the AKT signaling pathway and enhanced
cisplatin induced apoptosis in A549 cells[17]. MiR513a-3p can sensitize human lung adenocarcinoma
cells to cisplatin by targeting GSTP1 (Glutathione
S-transferase P1)[18]. MiR-92b is significantly upregulated in lung cancer cells and knockdown of miR92b inhibits cell growth and sensitizes the A549/DDP
cells to DDP by target PTEN (phosphatase and tensin
homolog) [19].
MiR-206 is one of the most studied and best
characterized miRNAs to date, which specifically
expressed in skeletal muscle[20]. Recently, there has
been increasing interest in understanding the role of miR206 in cancer, and down-regulation of miR-206 has been
observed in different types of cancers [21–27]. Decreased
expression of miR-206 in gastric cancer is associated
with tumor progression and poor survival [24]. miR-206
suppresses breast cancer cell migration and invasion by
targeting Cdc42 [28]. miR-206 can inhibit the expression
of VEGF and regulate the apoptosis and migration of
laryngeal cancer cells[29]. We and others have also
reported miR-206 overexpression could inhibit invasion
of lung cancers [22, 26, 30]. However, whether miR-206
is involved in regulating cisplatin resistance and EMT in
human lung adenocarcinomas remains unclear.

In this study, we found miR-206 was downregulated in both A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells.
Overexpression of miR-206 or knockdown of its target
MET reversed the mesenchymal features and sensitized
DDP-resistant cells to cisplatin. More importantly, we
demonstrated that decreased miR-206 levels induced
cisplatin resistance and EMT phenotype due to activation
of MET/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, upregulation of MDR1,
ZEB1 and Snail expression in DDP-resistant cells.
These results provide new insights into the molecular
mechanisms of cisplatin resistance induced by decreased
miR-206 levels in lung adenocarcinoma cells and suggest
miR-206 and its target gene pathway could be novel
therapeutic targets to reverse cisplatin resistance of lung
adenocarcinoma cells.

RESULTS
Cisplatin resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells
exhibit EMT features and have enhanced MDR1
expression
Previous studies have demonstrated that
chemotherapeutic drug can induce EMT, enhance
invasive ability, resulting in drug resistance [31, 32].
Snail and ZEB1 are two crucial EMT inducers [33].
Multi-drug resistance gene 1 (MDR1, ABCB1), encoding
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is one of pharmaceutical
carriers that can decrease the effective intracellular
concentration of the drug, leading to drug resistance
[34]. To determine the mechanism of cisplatin resistance
in lung adenocarcinoma cells, we first compared A549/
DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells with its parental cells
in cisplatin sensitivity, MDR1 expression levels, EMT
morphology and related markers expression. MTT
assay showed that A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells
exhibited significantly higher resistance to cisplatin
than non-DDP-resistant cells (Figure 1A). IC50 of
cisplatin in A549/DDP cells was 2.60 fold higher than
that in A549 cells and IC50 of cisplatin in H1299/DDP
cells was 2.69 fold higher than that in H1299 cells.
Western blotting showed that DDP-resistant cells had
higher levels of MDR1 protein expression than their
non-DDP-resistant cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore,
A549 cells and H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells
display epithelial characteristics, whereas A549/DDP
and H1299/DDP cells exhibited elongated, fibroblastoid
morphology and separated from one another (Figure
1C). Morphological conversion DDP-resistant cells
associated with EMT were also reflected by changes
in protein levels. Western blotting showed that A549/
DDP exhibited downregulation of E-cadherin levels
and upregulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail
and ZEB1 (Figure 1D). H1299/DDP cells also have
upregulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and ZEB1

than H1299 cells, but E-cadherin expression could not

wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay
demonstrated that the migration and invasion abilities
were significantly stronger in A549/DDP cells and
H1299/DDP cells (Figure 1E-1F, Supplementary Figure
1B-1C).

miR-206 has been found to be down-regulated in
many types of cancers including lung cancer[21-27, 30].
To determine whether miR-206 plays a pivotal role in drug

resistance in lung cancer cells, we measured the expression
of miR-206 in the A549/DDP cells, H1299/DDP cells and
their parental cells. Real-time PCR assay revealed that
miR-206 was significantly lowered in both A549/DDP
cells and H1299/DDP cells (Figure 2A, Supplementary
Figure 2A) compared with their parental cells. To further
validate the role of miR-206 in cisplatin resistance, we
transfected miR-206 mimics into A549/DDP cells and
H1299/DDP cells, transfected miR-206 inhibitors into
A549 cells and H1299 cells. MTT assay revealed that
miR-206 mimics treatment led to significantly decreased
resistance of A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells
to cisplatin, whereas miR-206 inhibitors transfection
enhanced the resistance of A549 cells and H1299 cells
to cisplatin (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 2B-2C).
Furthermore, western blotting showed that miR-206
mimics significantly decreased the expression of MDR1
in A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells, while miR-206
inhibitors increased the expression of MDR1 in A549 cells
and H1299 cells (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 2D).
Previous studies have shown that the drug-resistant
cancer cells display features of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)[32, 35, 36]. Here, we observed that
miR-206 mimics transfection led to a change from
elongated, fibroblastoid morphology to a rounded shap
in both A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells, whereas
miR-206 inhibitors transfection resulted in an elongated
fibroblast-like morphology of A549 cells and H1299 cells
(Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure 2E). Furthermore,
miR-206 mimics treatment caused the higher expression
of E-cadherin and lower expression of mesenchymal
markers including Vimentin, Snail and ZEB1 in A549/
DDP cells. Also, miR-206 mimics decreased the
expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and ZEB1 in
H1299/DDP cells (Figure 2E, Supplementary Figure 2F).
On the contrary, miR-206 inhibitors reduced E-cadherin
expression, induced the expression of Vimentin, ZEB1
and Snail in A549 cells, while induced N-cadherin,
Snail and ZEB1expression in H1299 cells (Figure 2F,
Supplementary Figure 2G). In addition, invasion and
migration assay further demonstrated that miR-206 mimics
suppressed the invasion and migration of A549/DDP
cells and H1299/DDP cells (Figure 2G, Supplementary
Figure 3A-3B), whereas miR-206 inhibitors enhanced
the invasion and migration of A549 cells and H1299 cells
(Figure 2H, Supplementary Figure 3C-3D). These results
indicated that miR-206 could reverses cisplatin resistance,
EMT, migration and invasion of cisplatin resistant cells.

miR-206 target site in the 3′-UTR of MET mRNA was
responsible for its regulation, we cloned MET 3′-UTR
wild type (MET-wt) or 3′-UTR mutant type (MET-mut)
into downstream of the luciferase reporter gene and
cotransfected with miR-206 mimics into A549 cells. A
luciferase reporter containing miR-206 inhibitor sequence
was used as a positive control (PC). As indicated in Figure
3A. Luciferase activity from a construct harboring miR206 inhibitor sequence (PC group) was significantly
decreased in A549 cells expressing either miR-206 or its
negative control form. Luciferase activity from A549 cells
cotransfected with miR-206 and the construct containing
MET-mut form did not induce any significant change
in luciferase activity, whereas luciferase activity from
A549 cells cotransfected with miR-206 and the construct
containing MET-wt was decreased by more than 95%
when compared to negative control cells. These results
indicate that miR-206 regulates MET protein in A549 cells
by directly targeting MET 3′-UTR.
On the other hand, we found that A549/DDP cells
and H1299/DDP cells expressed higher levels of MET
protein than A549 cells and H1299 cells (Figure 3B),
but basal expression of p-MET is undetectable in these
cell lines (data not shown). Western blotting showed that
miR-206 overexpression could significantly decrease
MET expression in A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells.
Meanwhile, down-regulated miR-206 could increase MET
expression level in A549 cells and H1299 cells (Figure
3C). These findings further confirmed the existence of an
inverse correlation between the expression of miR-206
and MET expression in these cell lines.

Low expression of miR-206 in lung
adenocarcinoma tissues correlates with increased
cisplatin resistance and MET expression
To better understand the association between
miR-206 and cisplatin resistance, a total of 34 clinical
lung tumor tissue samples were collected from patients
with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and divided into
“sensitive” and “insensitive” groups according to the
patient’s response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
As shown in Figure 4A, miR-206 was significantly
down-regulated in the “insensitive” group tissues (n
= 17) compared with that in the “sensitive” group (n =
17). Importantly, immunohistochemistry assay showed
that 16 of 17 “insensitive” group tissues (94.12%) had
positive immunostaining of MET protein but it was 4 of
17 (23.52%) in “sensitive” group (Figure 4B). Moreover,
the stronger immunoreactivity of MET was significantly
associated with lower miR-206 expression (r = 0.4086,
P = 0.0165, Figure 4C), suggesting that miR-206-MET
interaction might be biologically significant in cisplatin
resistance. In addition, IHC staining for MET, MDR1,
E-cadherin and Vimentin were performed on 5 samples
of each group. We found that except Vimentin, all five

cisplatin “insensitive” tissues have higher MET and
MDR1 expression, and lower E-cadherin expression.
In contrast, 3 out of 5 cisplatin “sensitive” tissues have
lower MET and MDR1 expression, and higher E-cadherin
expression (Supplementary figure 4).

the expression of MET was significantly suppressed by
MET-shRNA, and activated by MET expression vector
(ex-MET) (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure 5A).
MET inhibitor SU11274 treatment partially reversed
the mesenchymal phenotype of A549/DDP cells. MET
silence also reversed the mesenchymal phenotype in
both A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells, while MET
overexpression induced a mesenchymal phenotype in
A549 cells and H1299 cells (Figure 5B, Supplementary
Figure 5B). Western blotting analysis showed that both
MET inhibitor SU11274 and MET-shRNA increased
the E-cadherin protein expression, but decreased the
expression of mesenchymal markers including N-cadherin,

MET mediated EMT and cisplatin resistance
To determine whether the anti-EMT and anticisplatin resistance effects of miR-206 on DDP-resistant
cells could be partly explained by its targeting of MET,
we first analyzed how MET inhibitors, MET silence and
MET overexpression affected EMT. Our data showed that

Vimentin, ZEB1 and Snail (Figure 5C-5D, Supplementary
Figure 5D). In contrast, MET overexpression decreased
the E-cadherin protein expression, but increased the
expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1 and Snail
in A549 cells (Figure 5E). Similarly, MET-shRNA
decreased the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1
and Snail (Supplementary Figure 5B). In contrast, MET
overexpression increased the expression of N-cadherin,
Vimentin, ZEB1 and Snail in A549 cells (Supplementary
Figure 5C). However, E-cadherin expression could not be
detected in both conditions.
We next analyzed the effect of MET inhibitors,
MET silence and MET overexpression on cell cisplatin
sensitivity, migratory and invasive capability. As shown
in Figure 6, SU11274 significantly promoted cell growth
inhibition induced by cisplatin (Figure 6A) and decreased
the MDR1 expression in A549/DDP cells (Figure 6B).
Similarly, MET shNA transfection also increased the
sensitivity of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin (Figure 6D)
and decreased the MDR1 expression (Figure 6E). IC50
in SU11274 (0.5μM) group and MET shRNA group were
10.58μM and 3.53μM, significantly lower than their DDP
control groups (12.82μM and 10.06μM, respectively.
Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, SU11274
treatment and MET shRNA transfection showed similar
effects on suppressing migration and invasion of A549/
DDP cells (Figure 6C and Figure 6F). In contrast, MET
overexpression increased the cisplatin resistance and
MDR1 protein expression (Figure 6G-6H, Supplementary
Table 1), enhanced the capability of cell migration
and invasion (Figure 6I). In H1299/DDP cells, MET

silence decreased the MDR1 expression(Supplementary
Figure 5E), suppressed cell migration and invasion
(Supplementary Figure 6A-6B). While MET
overexpression increased MDR1 protein expression
(Supplementary Figure 5F), enhanced the capability of
H1299 cell migration and invasion(Supplementary Figure
6C-6D).

miR-206 inhibits EMT and cisplatin resistance
via MET dependent PI3K/AKT /mTOR
signaling pathways
PI3K/AKT/mTOR is one of the definite downstream
targets of MET receptor. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT
signaling has proven to be an efficient way to attenuate
the resistance of chemotherapy[37]. In present study, we
found that AKT/mTOR pathway is activated in A549/
DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells compared with the
parental cells (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure 7A).
To determine whether miR-206 inhibits MET dependent
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, we analyzed the
effects of miR-206 or MET expression changes on PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling. The results showed that both
miR-206 mimics transfection and MET-shRNA treatment
significantly decreased AKT, p-AKT, mTOR and p-mTOR
protein levels in A549/DDP cells (Figure 7B-7C,), and
MET inhibitor SU11274 also resulted in a decrease in
p-AKT, p-mTOR protein expression(Figure 7D). In
contrast, miR-206 inhibitors and MET overexpression
increased p-AKT, mTOR and p-mTOR protein levels in
A549 cells (Figure 7E-7F). Although the degree of gene

expression and protein levels varied between different cell
lines, similar results were also found in H1299/DDP and
H1299 cell lines (Supplementary Figure 7B-7C).
To further support the role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling in suppression of EMT and cisplatin resistance
by miR-206, PI3K selective inhibitor LY294002 and
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was utilized in A549/
DDP cells. LY294002 (10μM, 20μM) were observed to
remarkably reduce the protein of p-AKT and p-mTOR,
and rapamycin to reduce p-mTOR in A549/DDP cells

(Figure 7G-7H). Furthermore, both LY294002 (0.5μM)
and rapamycin (10nM) enhanced cisplatin sensitivity,
decreased the MDR1 expression in A549/DDP cells
(Figure 8A–8B). IC50 decreased from 11.12 μM to 7.78
μM for LY294002, and decreased from 11.12 μM to 8.31
μM for rapamycin (Supplimentary Table 1). In addition,
both LY294002 and rapamycin reversed mesenchymal
characteristics (Figure 8C), decreased the expression of
mesenchymal markers (Figure 8D-8E), and inhibited the
migration and invasion of A549/DDP cells (Figure 8F).

compared with DDP combined mimic NC group or DDP

miR-206 and its downstream MET/AKT/mTOR pathway
play important roles in controlling A549/DDP cells
cisplatin sensitivity.

miR-206 enhances A549/DDP cells to cisplatin
sensitivity in vivo

DISCUSSION

To further investigate the effect of miR-206
expression on cisplatin sensitivity, we evaluated the in
vivo antitumor activity of miR-206 in xenograft model.
As shown in Figure 9A-9B, The in vivo results parallel the
in vitro results and show that miR-206 resulted in dramatic
tumor regressions compared with both negative control or
DDP control group. Furthermore, the expression of MET,
AKT, p-AKT, mTOR and p-mTOR were significantly

Previous studies have reported that miR-206 could
act as a tumor-suppressor in various cancers including
lung cancer[21–30]. We and others have demonstrated
that miR-206 overexpression inhibited invasion and
metastasis in lung cancer cells[26, 30]. In the current
study, we demonstrated that miR-206 could suppress EMT

process and cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma
cells, partly through targeting MET and its downstream
PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Our
data provide a first insight into the function of miR-206
in regulating cisplatin resistance and EMT in cisplatin
resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells.
The EMT is a molecular process through which
an epithelial cell undergoes transdifferentiation into
a mesenchymal phenotype. Recent evidences have
suggested that EMT processes may play an important
role in the development of chemoresistance. It has
been reported knockdown of snail and slug reverses
the EMT phenotype and reduces ovarian cancer
cell resistance to cisplatin[17]. Inhibiting EMT by
overexpressing the microRNA miR-200 could abrogate
cyclophosphamide resistance in spontaneous breast-tolung metastasis models[38]. Furthermore, in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse models, EMT
suppression by Snail or Twist deletion leads to an increase
in cancer cell proliferation with enhanced expression
of nucleoside transporters in tumours, contributing
to enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment and
increased overall survival of mice[39]. In our models of
cisplatin resistant lung cancers, we found that EMT gene
signatures were also significantly correlated with the
presence of cisplatin resistance and increasing expression
of MDR1. The results further suggested a close correlation
between EMT and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells.
It is becoming increasingly evident that miRNAs
are key modulators of cisplatin resistance and EMT in
lung cancer. For instance, miR-451 is downregulated in
NSCLC tissues and is capable of conferring resistance to
cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer cell line (A549)
[40]. miR-224 can promote both in vitro and in vivo
cisplatin resistance of A549 cells via targeting gene p21
(WAF1/CIP1) and regulating G1/S cell cycle transition
and apoptosis [16]. Moreover, it has been reported that
downregulation of miRNA-27a is responsible for EMT
and cisplatin resistance in A549 cells by directly targeting
Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP)[41]. In support of
the role of miRNAs in cisplatin resistance and EMT in
lung cancer, our study identified that miR-206 is downregulated and could confer cisplatin resistance and EMT
in A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells.
Targeting MET might be an effective way to
enhance cisplatin sensitivity in certain tumors. It has been
reported that MET inhibition in osteosarcoma cancer is
associated with higher tumor aggressive behavior and
resistance to cisplatin therapy[42], and overexpression
of MET enhances survival of ovarian cancer cells and
increased resistance to cisplatin[43]. Moreover, HGF
increases cisplatin resistance via activation of MET in
lung cancer cells[27]. Consistent with these reports, our
data showed that downregulation of MET reduced EMT
process and reversed cisplatin resistance in A549/DDP
cells and H1299/DDP cells. Interestingly, we found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MET is also one of the targets of miR-206. Despite MET
has recently been identified as a target of miR-206 in
rhabdomyosarcoma cells [44]. We further demonstrated
that miR-206 directly target MET in lung cancer A549
cells. In addition, our results in clinical lung cancer tissue
samples show that the decreased expression of miR-206
closely correlated with increased MET expression and
poor cisplatin sensitivity. These data suggest that miR206-MET play important roles in regulating EMT and
cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells.
PI3K/AKT/mTOR is a crucial downstream
pathway of MET and can regulate many of the biological
phenomena, such as cell proliferation and survival,
motility and migration, and tumor cell invasion. In the
present study, we found miR-206-MET axis regualted
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in lung cancer cells. Both
miR-206 mimics and MET-shRNA suppresses the
phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR in A549/DDP cells. In
contrast, miR-206 inhibitors or MET overexpression
enhanced phosphorylation of AKT/ mTOR in A549 cells.
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms linking
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and DDP resistance,
we detected the expression of MDR1, a multispecific
efflux transporter of drugs, after PI3K selective inhibitor
LY294002 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin treatmnet in
A549/DDP cells. The results showed that both these two
inhibitors reduced the expression of MDR1. In contrast,
miR-206 inhibitors and MET overexpression activated
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and increased MDR1
expression in A549 cells. These results provides a possible
mechanism linking miR-206, MET/PI3K/AKT/ mTOR
pathway, cisplatin resistance, by which downregulated
expression of multi-drug resistance genes leads to
cisplatin resistance in A549 cells. In addition, We further
detected the expression of two transcription factors ZEB1
and Snail, which are two crucial EMT activators. We
demonstrated that decrease of EMT related transcription
factors, such as ZEB1 and Snail expression is one of the
molecular mechanisms from the deregulated miR-206
levels to the EMT.
In the present study, we also assessed the antitumour effect of miR-206 in a cisplatin-resistant in vivo
mice model. We found that miR-206 inhibited the MET/
AKT/ mTOR pathway and enhanced the A549/DDP cell
sensitivity to cisplatin in vivo. Therefore, these results
further demonstrated in vivo that miR-206 inhibiting MET
and its downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways is one
potential mechanism to overcome cisplatin resistance in
lung cancer. To the best of our knowledge, we provided
a first insight into the roles and possible mechanisms of
miR-206 upregulation in chemosensitivity of A549 cells
to cisplatin. However, because only two pairs of cisplatinresistance cell lines were used in our study, further
investigation in other lung adenocarcinoma cell lines is
necessary to explore the function and mechanisms of miR206 in cisplatin resistance.

Taken together, our study demonstrated that miR206 overexpression in human lung adenocarcinoma
cisplatin resistant cells inhibited the EMT and cisplatin
resistance by targeting MET and suppressing its
downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Low
expression of miR-206 and high levels of MET were
strongly associated with the poor cisplatin sensitivity of
lung adenocarcinoma patients. Therefore, activation of
miR-206 or inactivation of its target gene pathway may be
a potential strategy to reverse cisplatin resistance in human
lung adenocarcinoma cisplatin resistant cells.

weeks for a maximum of 5 cycles. Samples were divided
into “sensitive” (complete response or partial response)
and “insensitive” (stable disease or progressive disease)
groups according to the patient’s responses assessed
via medical image analysis and detection of serum

Transient transfection

MATERIALS AND METHODS

FAM-labled mimic negative control (mimic NC),
miR-206 mimics (mimics), inhibitor NC, miR-206
inhibitors, MET silence vectors p-GPU6-MET-shRNA
(MET-shRNA), shRNA control, MET (Accession NO:
NM_000245) overexpression vector pEZ/M98/neoMET (ex-MET) and the ex-control were purchased
from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The MET shRNA
sequences were designed as showed in Supplimentary
Table 2. The cells were seeded into 6-well plates and
transfected with 75 pmol oligonucleotides or 2.5μg
shRNA vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
USA) according to the instructions provided by the
manufacturer. The cells were used for further analysis 48h
after transfection.

Cell culture
Human lung cancer cell line A549, H1299 and
A549/DDP were obtained from China Center for Type
Culture Collection (CCTCC, Shanghai, China). All the
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To
establish cisplatin-resistant H1299 cell lines, H1299 cells
were first treated with 0.6 μM of cisplatin (DDP, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), and then were treated with increased
concentrations of DDP in a stepwise manner during each
passage. To maintain the drug-resistant phenotype, DDP
(with final concentration of 2μM) was added to the culture
media for A549/DDP cells and H1299/DDP cells.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA). The concentration and purity of
the RNA samples were determined spectroscopically.
Expression of mature miRNA was assayed using
stem-loop RT followed by real-time PCR analysis.
The SYBR and U6 gene were used for detecting the
gene amplification and normalizing the each sample,
respectively. The primers for RT-PCR were designed
based on the miR-206 sequences provided by the Sanger
Center miRNA Registry. The RT primers were designed
as showed in Supplimentary Table 3. qRT-PCR was
performed on the ABI (Applied Biosystems) 7900 HT
Thermal cycler in standard mode for 40 cycles. The fold
change was calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt Method. PCR was
performed in triplicate.

Reagents and antibodies

Based on the miRNA databases (microRNA.org,
miRDB and TargetScan database), MET is a predicted
target of miR-206 in humans. According to the results of
prediction, we cloned MET 3'UTR fragment containing
the predicted site into pGL3 luciferase reporter vector
(pmirGLO3, Promega, Madison, USA) and named as
MET-wt. We cloned MET 3'UTR fragment with mutant
sequence into pmirGLO3 luciferase reporter vector and

and transferred to a polyvinylidene dfluoride (PVDF)
membrane (Millipore, Germany). The blots were blocked
in BSA (5% w/v in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at
room temperature and immunostained with antibodies at
4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore, Germany)

named as MET-mut. In addition, miR-206 inhibitor
sequence was also cloned into pmirGLO3 luciferase
reporter vector as a positive control (PC). For luciferase
assay, the reporter plasmid was cotransfected with miR206 mimics or mimic NC in A549 cells. After 48 h, cells
were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega,Madison, USA).

Migration and invasion assay

Immunohistochemistry

Wound healing experiment and Transwell insert (24well insert; pore size 8μm, Corning, USA) assays were
used to determine the migration and invasion abilities
of the cells, respectively. Briefly, for the wound healing
experiment, cells were grown to confuence wounded
using a pipette tip and photographed at 0 h and subsequent
time points. Cell migration was evaluated by measuring
the width of the wound at the identical position. For the
invasion assay, the lower chambers of matrigel-coated
invasion plates were used. Cells (50,000) were added to
the upper chamber in serum-free media and invasion at
37 °C towards 10% FBS-containing growth media was
determined after 24 h. Cells that invaded through the
membrane were fixed, stained with crystal violet and
photographed. The invaded cells were counted by Image
J software. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.

Tissue slides were incubated for 2 h at 56 °C and deparaffinized. Antigen retrieval was obtained by microwave
treatment in citrate buffer for 15 min to retrieve
antigenicity. After peroxidase activity was blocked with
3% H2O2/methanol for 10 min, sections were incubated
with normal goat serum for 20 min to block non-specific
antibody binding sites. Sections were incubated with the
primary antibodies for 1 h at 25°C followed by incubations
with biotinylated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG and peroxidaselabelled streptavidin for 10 min each. The percentage of
the cells with cytoplasmic labeling was recorded from
two areas of each specimen, and the labeling intensity was
estimated as 1+, 2+ or 3+. The immunohistochemistry
results were categorized into two groups: the samples
without any labeling, 1+ labeling in <25% cells, and 2+
labeling in <5% cells were considered negative; all the
remaining samples were defined as positive.

In vitro drug sensitivity assay
The cells were plated in 6-well plates (3×105 cells/
well) and 75 pmol of the miR-206 mimic or negative control
were transfected into the A549/DDP cells, while a miR-206
inhibitors or inhibitor negative control were transfected into
the A549 cells, using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, the cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (5×103cells/well) for the following experiment. After
cell adhesion, freshly prepared anticancer drug (cisplatin;
Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Jinan, China) was added at
a final concentration of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 μM for A549/DDP,
and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 μM for A549 cells. Forty-eight hours after
the addition of the drug, cell viability was assessed by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)
-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The absorbance at 490 nm (A490)
of each well was read on a spectrophotometer. The
concentration at which the drug produced 50% inhibition of
growth (IC50) was estimated by the relative survival curve.
Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate.

Animal studies
All experimental procedures used in this study
had been approved by the ethics committee in the 117th
Hospital of PLA. Male nude mice (BALB/c, 4-6wk) were
purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center
(Shanghai, China). For preparation of subcutaneous
xenograft model, 0.2 ml A549/DDP lung cancer cells (2.0
× 106) in phosphate buffered saline/100 μl were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank of the nude mice. 15
days after cell inoculation, total of 20 mice were divided
randomly into four groups (five mice per group). miR-206
agomirs and miR-206 agomir negative control (NC) (2
nmol; Genepharma, Shanghai, China) were given locally
by direct injection into the xenografts every two days.
Meanwhile, cisplatin was administered via intraperitoneal
injection at a dose of 5 mg/kg every other day. After 30
days of treatment, all mice were sacrificed. Transplanted
tumors were excised, and the wet weight was recorded.
Protein expression in tumors was detected by western
blotting assay.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Germany). Total protein was quantfied by
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Nanjing, China),
and an equal amount of whole cell lysates was resolved
