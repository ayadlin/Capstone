ABSTRACT
We have previously demonstrated that Tenascin-C (TNC)+ human neuroblastoma
(NB) cells transdifferentiate into tumor-derived endothelial cells (TDEC), which
have been detected both in primary tumors and in tumors formed by human NB
cell lines in immunodeficient mice. TDEC are genetically unstable and may favor
tumor progression, suggesting that their elimination could reduce tumor growth
and dissemination. So far, TDEC have never been targeted by antibody-mediated
immunotherapy in any of the tumor models investigated.
To address this issue, immunodeficient mice carrying orthotopic NB formed by
the HTLA-230 human cell line were treated with TDEC-targeting cytotoxic human
(h)CD31, that spares host-derived endothelial cells, or isotype-matched mAbs.
hCD31 mAb treatment did not affect survival of NB-bearing mice, but increased
significantly hypoxia in tumor microenvironment, where apoptotic and proliferating
TDEC coexisted, indicating the occurrence of vascular remodeling.
Tumor cells from hCD31 mAb treated mice showed i) up-regulation of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)-related and vascular mimicry (VM)-related gene
expression, ii) expression of endothelial (i.e. CD31 and VE-cadherin) and EMTassociated (i.e. Twist-1, N-cadherin and TNC) immunophenotypic markers, and iii)
up-regulation of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) expression. In vitro experiments
with two NB cell lines showed that hypoxia was the common driver of all the above
phenomena and that human recombinant HMGB-1 amplified EMT and TDEC transdifferentiation.
In conclusion, TDEC targeting with hCD31 mAb increases tumor hypoxia, setting
the stage for the occurrence of EMT and of new waves of TDEC trans-differentiation.
These adaptive responses to the changes induced by immunotherapy in the tumor
microenvironment allow tumor cells to escape from the effects of hCD31 mAb.

INTRODUCTION

micro-vessels (EM) [1-3]. Tumor cells themselves may
contribute to vascularization by assembling into vascularlike channels according to a process referred to as vascular
mimicry (VM). [4].

Tumor growth is critically dependent on adequate
blood supply provided by newly formed endothelial

Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal tumor arising
from sympathetic neuronal progenitor cells that accounts
for 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths [5-7]. We previously
identified in primary NB tumors, as well as in orthotopic
tumors formed in immunodeficient mice by different
human NB cell lines, tumor-derived endothelial cells
(TDEC) harboring MYCN amplification as the NB cells
from which they originated [8-10]. More recently, we have
identified perivascular NB progenitor cells expressing
Tenascin C (TNC) on the cell surface, that displayed a high
degree of plasticity and served as TDEC progenitors [10].
TDEC are genetically unstable and contribute to chemoresistance and tumor progression [11].
A hypoxic microenvironment is of pivotal
importance for tumor growth. Hypoxia inducible factors
regulate hypoxia responsive genes and play critical roles
in tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance [12].
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an
embryonic process leading to the loss of cell-cell contact,
repression of E-cadherin expression and increased cell
motility. EMT can also occur in cancer cells, in which it
is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs
and radiation [13], and increased stemness, motility,
invasiveness, as well as angiogenic and metastatic ability
[13, 14]. An hypoxic tumor microenvironment is one of
the major EMT inducers [15, 16].
We have hypothesized that selective elimination of
TDEC might reduce tumor growth. To address this issue,
we have here selectively targeted TDEC in an orthotopic
mouse model of human NB using a cytotoxic hCD31 mAb
that does not react with mouse endothelial cells (mEC).
Our findings demonstrate that hCD31 mAb-induced
enhancement of tumor hypoxia activates i) EMT and ii)
trans-differentiation of malignant cells into TDEC, both
of which in turn account for the failure of such therapeutic
approach.

studies showing that tumor-derived and mouse-derived
EM, although displaying different kinetics of formation,
are present in similar proportions after approximately two
weeks from HTLA-230 NB cell inoculation [10].
Tumors from mice treated with hCD31 mAb (n=7)
were significantly smaller than control tumors (n=7) (p=
0.047) (Fig. 1A), but treatment with hCD31 mAb did not
prolong survival of tumor bearing (n=14) vs control (n=14)
mice (Fig. 1B). Human EM density, assessed by hCD31
staining, decreased significantly (p= 0.011) in orthotopic
tumors from hCD31 mAb treated (n=7) vs control (n=7)
mice (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, apoptotic hCD31+ EM
(defined as EM containing at least three TUNEL+ TDEC)
increased significantly (p= 0.036) in the former (n=5) vs
the latter (n=5) tumors (Fig. 2B and 2C, panel 1). Focal
micro-vascular destruction and hemorrhagic areas were
detected in tumors from hCD31 mAb treated mice (Fig.
2C, panel 2).
Double staining of NB tissue sections with hCD31
mAb and anti-Ki-67 mAb, that identifies proliferating
cells, showed that hCD31+, Ki-67+ EM (defined as
EM containing at least three Ki-67+ TDEC) increased
significantly (p= 0.006) in tumors from hCD31 mAb
treated vs control mice (Fig. 2B and 2C, panel 3),
indicating the occurrence of human EM remodeling.
Mouse EM integrity was unaffected by hCD31 mAb
treatment (Fig. 2C, panel 4) and mouse EM density was
increased in tumors from hCD31 mAb treated vs control
mice (p< 0.0001) (Fig. 2A).

hCD31 mAb immunotherapy increases tumor
hypoxia
TDEC depletion induced by hCD31 mAb treatment
may reduce blood supply and increase tumor hypoxia.
Hypoxia inducible factor-2α (HIF2α) is up-regulated in
NB cells during hypoxic conditions and represents the
most reliable hypoxic marker in NB [19]. In addition,
HIF2α has been associated with developing endothelium
[20].We stained by immunofluorescence orthotopic NB
tissue sections from hCD31 treated (n=7) or control
(n=7) mice with anti-HIF2α mAb [19]. The proportion of
HIF2α+ cells was significantly higher in the former than in
the latter tumors (61.9±3.22% vs 20.7± 6.18%, p= 0.0001)
(Fig. 2C, panels 5 and 6).
In essence, TDEC contributed to NB vascularization
since their targeting with hCD31 mAb reduced tumor
size, decreased the number of human EM and increased
hypoxia in tumor microenvironment.

RESULTS
Tumor-derived endothelial cells (TDEC)
contribute to tumor vascularization in an
orthotopic mouse model of human NB
Immunodeficient mice were inoculated in the
adrenal gland with the human NB cell line HTLA-230
that, according to previous studies from our group [8-10],
best mimics human NB growth and progression. Mice
were treated with the hCD31 cytotoxic Moon-1 mAb
[17] or isotype-matched control mAb. Supplementary
Fig. 1 shows that the hCD31 mAb Moon-1 stained human
TDEC, but not mEC.
All experiments were performed with tumors
harvested eighteen days after NB cell inoculation. Such
time point was selected on the ground of our previous

hCD31 mAb immunotherapy up-regulates
expression of human pro-angiogenic genes in NB
cells

(PDGFA), fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1), TNF and
IL-6 (Fig. 3A, black bars). High expression of these proangiogenic genes, the majority of which are not speciesspecific, likely accounts for the increased numbers of
mouse-derived EM in NB tumors from h-CD31 mAb
treated mice.
Two distinctive “signatures” related to VM [21]
and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [22-24],
respectively, were identified. In particular, VM-related
transcripts included VE-cadherin (CDH5), collagen IV
(COL4A), endothelial differentiation receptor (EDG1),
IL-6, TNF-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2), the matrix
metalloproteinase MMP2, jagged-1 (JAG1), i.e. the ligand
for the receptor Notch-1, and thrombospondin-1 (THBS1)

We next investigated the angiogenic phenotype of
tumors from hCD31 mAb treated (n=4) vs control (n=4)
mice using PCR arrays specific for selected human or
mouse angiogenic transcripts. hCD31 mAb treatment
caused up-regulation (range 1,000-160,000 fold) of the
expression of different human pro-angiogenic genes
including CCL11, CXCL3, CXCL5, cadherin 5 (CDH5),
also known as vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin,
collagen type IVα3 (COL4A3), vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor-A

[21]. EMT-related transcripts included epidermal growth
factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin
growth factor-1 (IGF-1), TNF, CXCL5, IL-6, FGF-1,
PDGFA and MMP2 [22-25].
Expression of some human anti-angiogenic genes
including interferon (IFN)A1, IFNB1, CXCL9, CXCL10
and Leukocyte cell derived chemotaxin-1 (LECT1) was

also increased following hCD31 treatment (Fig. 3A, grey
bars), perhaps in response to massive up-regulation of
pro-angiogenic genes. In contrast, expression of mouse
angiogenesis related genes was unaffected or dampened
by hCD31 treatment (Fig. 3B).
We next asked whether human TDEC targeting
altered the number and/or proliferative status of TNC+/
Oct-4+ NB vascular progenitor cells [10], identified by
TNC surface staining, and MYCN FISH. TNC+ NB cells
carrying MYCN amplification, that showed a perivascular
distribution [10], increased significantly in tumors from
hCD31 treated (n=5) vs control (n=5) mice (p= 0.0012)
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, the fraction of proliferating (Ki-67+)
TNC+ cells was 8% (11/141) in hCD31 treated and 3%
(5/154) in control mice (p< 0.0001; 95% Binomial Exact
Confidence Interval).
Thus, TDEC remodeling triggered by hCD31 mAbdriven depletion of TDEC caused an increase of cycling
TNC+ vascular progenitor NB cells, likely setting the stage
for TDEC replenishment.

progenitors, per field were assessed by immunofluorescence.

functionally different human TNC isoforms are generated
by alternative splicing of the TNC transcript [26]. TNC
is a multi-modular protein with a cysteine-rich assembly
domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains,
several fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, and a
fibrinogen-like domain [25]. Up to six additional domains
can be inserted between the fifth and sixth domain by
alternative splicing domains (A1 to A4, B, C and D) [18,
27]. To identify what isoform(s) of TNC was expressed
by NB progenitor cells, we used a series of murine mAbs
specific for different alternatively spliced domains of
this molecule [18]. Only the TNC isoform containing the
alternatively spliced FnIII domains A1, A2, A4, and B was
consistently detected in TNC+ NB vascular progenitor
cells present in orthotopic NB tumors (n=4) (Fig. 5). This
large TNC isoform is selectively expressed in neural stem/

progenitor cells [28].

hCD31 mAb immunotherapy induces epithelialmesenchymal transition in orthotopic NB tumors
Detection of an EMT “signature” in NB cells from
hCD31 mAb treated mice prompted experiments in
which tumor tissue sections were stained with mAbs to
Twist-1, the master regulator of EMT [29], N-cadherin and
E-cadherin.
Most tumor cells from control mice (n=7) showed
cytoplasmic expression of Twist-1 (83±5%), consistent
with its transcriptional inactive state [29] (Fig. 6A, panel
1). The same cells expressed E-cadherin (98±2%) (Fig.
6A, panel 3) but not N-cadherin (Fig. 6A, panel 5).
In contrast, tumors from hCD31 mAb treated mice

In vitro culture of HTLA-230 NB cells under
hypoxic conditions induces expression of epithelial
mesenchymal transition-related and endothelial
cell-related markers, as well as of HMGB-1

(n=7) showed in most of the cells nuclear expression of
Twist-1 (79±7%), indicative of ongoing transcriptional
activity [29] (Fig. 6A, panel 2). In addition, NB cells
displayed expression of N-cadherin (98±3%) (Fig. 6A,
panel 6) but not E-cadherin (Fig. 6A, panel 4). These
results confirmed the onset of EMT [30] in tumors from
hCD31 mAb treated mice.
Hypoxia may up-regulate the expression of highmobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1) [31], that acts
as extracellular signaling molecule during inflammation,
angiogenesis, cell differentiation, cell migration, and
tumor metastasis [32-35]. Indeed, HMGB-1+ cells were
significantly increased in tumors from hCD31 mAb treated
(n=7) vs control (n=7) mice (77.3±8.2% vs 11.0±2.7%, p=
0.0004). HMGB-1 was always detected in the cytoplasm
of NB cells (Fig. 6A, panels 7 and 8), suggesting a role of
this molecule in the stimulation of cell motility [32-35].

In order to investigate the in vitro conditions
allowing expression of EMT-related and endothelial
markers in NB cells, HTLA-230 cells were incubated in
hypoxia (1% O2) or normoxia for 24-72 h. In four different
experiments, cytoplasmic Twist-1 was detected in 80±13%
cells under normoxia only (control) (Fig. 6B, panel 1),
whereas nuclear Twist-1 was detected in 76±5% HTLA230 cells under hypoxia only (Fig. 6B, panel 2). Hypoxia
induced down-regulation of E-cadherin (<1%), while
strong basal expression of the latter marker (mean± SD
82±7%) was detected in normoxic cells (Fig. 6B, panels

HMGB-1 mimics hypoxia in vitro

3 and 4, respectively). Conversely, hypoxia induced de
novo expression of N-cadherin (mean ±SD 85±10%) that
was detected in less than 1% normoxic cells (Fig. 6B,
panels 5 and 6). Under hypoxia, HTLA-230 cells acquired
expression of the endothelial-specific markers CD31
(mean ±SD 35±9% ) (Fig. 6B, panels 7 and 8) and VEcadherin (mean ±SD 72±6%) (Fig. 6B, panels 9 and 10),
that were undetectable in normoxic cells. Furthermore,
TNC+ cells, that serve as TDEC progenitors [10], were
significantly increased in hypoxic compared to normoxic
NB cells (means ±SD: 20.0±4.3% vs 10.0±2.7%, p=
0.006) (Fig. 6B, panels 11 and 12). Finally, most HTLA230 cells cultured in hypoxia acquired the expression of
HMGB-1, that was virtually undetectable in normoxic
cells.
These data establish definitively that hypoxia
induces expression of EMT-related and endothelial
markers in NB cells.

Since HMGB-1 induces EMT in lung [32] and renal
[34] fibrosis, we finally investigated whether HMGB1 behaved similarly in our human NB models under
normoxic conditions. In four different experiments,
HTLA-230 cells were cultured with HMGB-1 for 2472 h. Fig. 7A shows that HTLA-230 cells cultured with
HMGB-1 acquired the expression of N-cadherin and lost
that of E-cadherin, indicative of an ongoing EMT. The
same cells expressed de novo VE-cadherin (mean ±SD
87±4.3%), CD31 (mean ±SD 30±2.5%), and PSMA [10]
(mean ±SD 75±1%), witnessing the occurrence of transendothelial differentiation of NB cells. Accordingly,
TDEC progenitors expressing Oct-4 both in the nucleus
and the cytoplasm were doubled in HTLA-230 cells
incubated with HMGB-1 compared to control (means
±SD: 18.0±3% vs 9.0±3.2%, p= 0.008) (Fig. 7A).

Figure 8: A model for hypoxia-driven EMT and trans-endothelial differentiation of NB cells. TDEC targeting with cytotoxic

hCD31 mAb enhances tumor hypoxia, which in turn induces EMT and endothelial trans-differentiation of tumor cells. Both of the latter
phenomena increase the proportion of TNC+/Oct-4+ NB cells, that differentiate into TDEC responsible for the vascular remodeling observed
in tumors from hCD31 treated mice. In addition, hCD31 mAb-driven hypoxia promotes in NB cells expression of HGMB-1 that induces by
itself EMT and endothelial trans-differentiation of tumor cells, thus mimicking the effects of hypoxia and serving as an amplification loop.
All of these mechanisms in combination account for the refractoriness of NB tumors to TDEC targeting with hCD31 mAb.

When HTLA-230 and IMR-32 NB cell lines were
treated with HMGB-1 and analyzed by flow cytometry
(n=3 experiments), both cell lines variably up-regulated
the expression of TNC, VE-cadherin and CD31, thus
confirming that HMGB-1 induced the acquisition of EMTrelated (TNC) and endothelial (VE-cadherin and CD31)
markers (Fig. 7B).

VM-related and other pro-angiogenic genes was detected
by PCR array in tumors from hCD31 mAb treated mice.
Angiogenic factors, which are produced by tumor cells
in response to hypoxia, reduce the pro-apoptotic potency
of chemotherapy on endothelial cell [47]. By activating
hypoxic response in tumor cells, antiangiogenic therapy
may promote metastasis and invasion [47].
Hypoxia is also an inducer of EMT, characterized
by loss of cell junction and gain of migratory behavior
[30, 33]. Twist-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptionfactor that promotes EMT [48-50] through i) repression
of E-cadherin [48], leading to disassembly of adherens
junctions and increased migratory potential [50], and ii)
up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, as N-cadherin and
TNC [49]. In our experiments, tumors from hCD31 mAb
treated mice showed nuclear translocation of Twist-1,
lost E-cadherin expression and acquired N-cadherin
expression, indicating the occurrence of hCD31 mAbinitiated EMT. These findings were corroborated by the
results of PCR array analysis of tumors from hCD31 mAb
vs isotype treated mice showing the presence of an EMTrelated “signature” in the former tumors.
Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
are released by dying cells [51]. The main DAMP is
HMGB-1 [52, 53], that promotes angiogenesis, evasion
of programmed cell death, self-sufficiency in growth
signals, insensitivity to inhibitors of growth, autophagy,
and tissue invasion and metastasis [52-54]. Tumor
angiogenesis is enforced by autocrine regulation of
HMGB-1 in EC through increased expression of key proangiogenic genes as PDGF-A, FGF and MMP-2 [55],
that we found to be strongly up-regulated in tumors from
hCD31 mAb treated mice. We asked whether the latter
tumors expressed HMGB-1. Indeed, most tumor cells
from hCD31 mAb treated mice expressed HMGB-1,
that was barely detectable in control tumors, suggesting
that hypoxia augmented by hCD31 mAb treatment upregulated HMGB-1 [52-54].
The results of in vivo experiments were confirmed
by in vitro studies with NB cell lines incubated in hypoxia.
These cells i) acquired expression of N-cadherin and
nuclear Twist-1 and lost that of E-cadherin, ii) expressed
de novo the EC-related markers CD31 and VE-cadherin,
as well as HMGB-1, and iii) up-regulated the expression
of TNC that, beside representing an EMT marker [56],
identifies NB TDEC progenitors [10]. The latter finding
is consistent with the significant increase of TNC+/Oct4+ cycling TDEC progenitors observed in tumors from
hCD31 mAb treated mice.
HMGB-1 can induce EMT in human kidney tubular
epithelial cells [34] and mouse alveolar epithelial cells
[32]. We found that HMGB-1 induced expression of EMT
and EC markers in NB cells cultured in normoxia, thus
mimicking the effects of hypoxia. HMGB-1 conceivably
bound to NB cells through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4),
and/or RAGE [57], that have been shown in previous

DISCUSSION
Primary NB tumors may contain a variable number
(range 20-78%) of TDEC carrying the same genomic
alteration as tumor cells [10]. TNC+ perivascular NB
cells serving as TDEC progenitors have been identified in
primary NB samples, metastatic bone marrow aspirates,
NB cell lines, and orthotopic tumors formed by these cell
lines in immunodeficient mice [8-10].
Studies aimed at targeting TDEC, that are
genetically unstable and contribute to tumor progression
[11], have shown that thalidomide, sirolimus, curcumin,
isoxanthohumol or resveratrol inhibited TDEC formation
in various pre-clinical models [36]. Differentiation of
CD133+ glioblastoma stem cells into TDEC [37-39] was
unaffected by anti-VEGF mAb, but blocked by γ-secretase
inhibition or Notch-1 silencing [39].
Here we have targeted for the first time human
TDEC in vivo with the cytotoxic hCD31 mAb Moon-1,
taking advantage of its high specificity witnessed by the
lack of any reactivity with host-derived EC. Significant
decrease of TDEC due to apoptosis and reduction of
tumor size unambiguously proved that TDEC contributed
to NB growth. However, tumors harvested at the end
of immunotherapy cycles displayed active vascular
remodeling, as shown by detection of proliferating TDEC.
In this respect, treatment with VEGF inhibitors or VEGF
gene inactivation in preclinical mouse models of cancer
were previously found to increase tumor invasiveness and
metastasis, as well as EC proliferation, that could play
a role in a putative rebound dampening anti-angiogenic
treatment efficacy [40-42].
Hypoxia-inducible factor renders cells capable
of surviving in hypoxia and stimulates endothelial cell
growth [43]. On one hand, hypoxia inhibits the mTOR
pathway, mTOR-dependent translation of HIF-1 and
prevents senescent phenotype [44]. On the other hand,
hypoxia strongly posttranslationally induces HIF-1,
which increases secretion of mitogens and cytokines,
markers of cellular senescence and promotes it [43]. We
reasoned that hypoxia could drive vascular remodeling in
NB tumors from mice treated with hCD31 mAb [45, 46].
Indeed, a highly significant increase of HIF-2α expression
was detected in tumors from hCD31 mAb treated mice,
indicating that TDEC targeting resulted into generation
of a strongly hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia
was previously shown to induce expression of VM-related
genes [21]. Indeed, up-regulation of the expression of

studies to be expressed by these cells [58]. It is tempting
to speculate that HMGB-1 synergizes with hypoxia subserving the same or similar functions in less hypoxic or
normoxic areas of the tumor mass.
Taken together, our results indicate that hypoxiadriven enhancement of VM and onset of EMT represent
adaptive mechanisms to the perturbation of tumor
microenvironment caused by hCD31 mAb treatment.
Notably, in this respect, nuclear translocation of Twist-1
[29] initiated VM in hepatocellular [29, 50] and colorectal
[59] carcinomas, showing that EMT and VM are linked.
Additional mechanisms beside hypoxia may
contribute to the onset of EMT in tumors from hCD31
mAb treated mice. IL-6, whose expression was upregulated in the latter tumors, is a well known inducer of
EMT and mediates trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer
[60]. Anaphylotoxins as C3a and C5a, generated in our
study by hCD31 mAb-mediated complement activation,
regulate EMT in non-malignant disease models [61, 62].
In conclusion, we propose the following model (Fig.
8). TDEC targeting with cytotoxic hCD31 mAb enhances
tumor hypoxia, which in turn induces EMT and promotes
endothelial trans-differentiation of tumor cells. Both of
the latter phenomena increase the proportion of TNC+/
Oct-4+ NB cells, that differentiate into TDEC responsible
for the vascular remodeling observed in tumors from
hCD31 mAb treated mice. In addition, hCD31 mAbdriven hypoxia promotes in NB cells expression of
HGMB-1 that induces by itself EMT and endothelial
trans-differentiation of tumor cells, thus serving as an
amplification loop of hypoxia (Fig. 8). Altogether these
mechanisms account for the refractoriness of NB tumors
to TDEC targeting with hCD31 mAb. A potential strategy
to exploit hypoxia for therapeutic purposes might be to
combine an antiangiogenic treatment with inactive prodrugs that are activated by hypoxia [47].

Treatment of neuroblastoma bearing mice with
hCD31 mAb
Tumor bearing mice were allocated randomly into
three groups of seven mice each to receive intravenously
(iv) the hCD31 Moon-1 purified mAb (IgG2, 450 μg/
mouse) [17], or isotype-matched IgG2 irrelevant mAb
(450 μg/mouse) for two weeks starting from day 2 after
tumor cell inoculation. Treatment was administered every
three days for a total of five injections. This protocol was
repeated in three different experiments.

Quantification of tumor growth
Mice were sacrificed i) when they showed signs
of poor health to evaluate survival or ii) the day after
the conclusion of last cycle of antibody treatment, i.e.
day 18, in order to measure tumor volume and perform
histological and immunohistochemical studies. Tumor
volume was measured with a caliper using the following
formula: Volume = π/6 x (w1 x w2) (w1= largest tumor
diameter; w2 smallest tumor diameter). For histological
analyses tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin.

Immunofluorescence analysis and quantifications
of micro-vessel density
Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on
formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded or on cryopreserved
tissue sections from mice sacrificed, or on cytospins of
the HTLA-230 cell line as previously described [10].
Paraffin sections (2-4 μm thick) were processed by
standard deparaffinization with xylene and hydrated in
a descending ethanol series to double-distilled water.
Antigen retrieval on formalin-fixed tissue section
was performed using Sodium-Citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using
the following mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs):
anti-human(h)CD31 (diluted 1/50; Dako Cytomation,
Hamburg, Germany), anti-mouse(m)CD34 (1/50; Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), anti-hOct-4 (1/50, Clone
3A5; Abcam Inc, Cambridge, USA), anti-hTenascin C
(1/50; Millipore, Milan, Italy), anti-Ki-67 (1/60; Dako
Cytomation), anti hE-cadherin (1/25, Clone EP700Y;
Millipore), anti hN-cadherin (1/25, Clone EPR1792Y;
Millipore), anti-hTwist-1 (1/50, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), anti hHMGB-1 (1/20, Clone 1B11, Abnova,
Taipei, Taiwan), anti-hVE-cadherin (1:50; Chemicon

METHODS
Orthotopic mouse model of human neuroblastoma
Seven/eight week old female athymic nude (nude/
nude) mice from Harlan Laboratories (Harlan Italy, S.
Pietro al Natisone, Italy) were housed in sterile enclosures
under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were
subjected to laparotomy, and injected with HTLA-230
cells (1.5×106 cells in 20 μl of saline solution) in the left
adrenal gland [10]. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(Imalgene 1000, Merial Italia SpA., Milan, Italy) and
sacrificed by cervical dislocation. All procedures involving
animals were performed in the respect of the National and
International current regulations (D.lvo 27/01/1992, n°
116, European Economic Community Council Directive
86/609, OJL 358, Dec. 1, 1987) and were reviewed and

PCR-Array profiling

International, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and antiHIF2α (1:100; Novus Biologicals) were used. In addition,
we used the following mouse mAbs (1/20 dilution) specific
for the different epitopes of hTNC, generously donated by
Dr L. Zardi, Syrius Biotech, Genoa, Italy: anti BC-7, anti
BC-4, anti BC-8, anti BC-6, anti BC-9, anti BC-2, antiIII8TN, anti-α/A2, anti BC-3, anti-III12TN [18]. Isotypematched nonbinding mAbs were used in all antibodystaining experiments to exclude non specific reactivities.
Slides were incubated with primary antibodies overnight
at 4° C. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse IgG
conjugated to Alexa-488 or goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa-568
(1:200; Invitrogen, Germany). After washing, the slides
were counterstained with 4’,6’-diamidino-2- phenylindole
(DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and cover-slipped.
EM density was assessed by anti-hCD31 or antimCD34 staining and examination of twenty to fifty
microscopic fields (0.5 mm2) per tumor. We have shown
in a previous study that the anti-hCD31 or anti-mCD34
mAbs used in this study are rigorously species-specific
[10]. The most intense vascular areas (hotspots) were
selected subjectively from each tumor section. EM with a
clearly defined lumen or well-defined linear vessel shape
were taken into account for EM counting.

RNA was extracted using TRIZOL® from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse transcribed
by the ReactionReady™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis
kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation). Human and
murine angiogenesis RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array and RT2
Real-Timer™ SyBR Green/ROX PCR was performed
according to the instructions of the manufacturer on ABI
Prism™ 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems).

Cell culture and human recombinant HMGB-1
protein treatment of HTLA-230 and IMR-32 cell
lines
HTLA-230 and IMR-32 cells were maintained
as previously described [10]. HTLA-230 and IMR-32
NB cells were cultured on glass slide containing dishes
(Millipore) with or without human recombinant HMGB1 protein (10μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 72 h. E-cadherin,
N-cadherin, Twist-1, TNC, CD31 and VE-cadherin
expression were assessed by immunofluorescence staining.

Flow cytometry

Detection of apoptotic or proliferating endothelial
cells

TNC, CD31 and VE-cadherin expression was
investigated on HTLA-230 and IMR-32 cell lines cultured
with or without HMGB-1 (10μg/ml) by flow cytometry.
Cells were first incubated for 30 min at 4° C with primary
mAbs, then for 20 min with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse
FITC-conjugated mAb (Dako Cytomation, Denmark). An
isotype-matched primary mAb (Merk Millipore, Billerica,
MA) was used as negative control. Samples were analyzed
by Gallios flow cytometer and Kaluza software (Beckman
Coulter, Milano, Italy). Results are expressed as MRFI
calculated as ratio between MFI of specific mAb and MFI
of irrelevant isotype-matched mAb.

Apoptosis was evaluated using in situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany).
The Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated
dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) reaction was carried
out by incubating tumor tissues with FITC-dUTP labeled
nucleotides and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT), which catalyzes polymerization of labeled
nucleotides to free 3’-OH DNA ends. Apoptotic or
proliferating cells were detected by staining for TUNEL
or Ki-67, respectively, in combination with hCD31.
Apoptotic or proliferating EM were operationally defined
as containing at least three TUNEL+ or Ki-67+ cells,
respectively.

In vitro hypoxia models
HTLA-230 and IMR-32 cell lines were incubated
for 24, 48 and 72 h at 37° C. in a hypoxia incubator
(Invivo2 Hypoxia Workstation, Ruskinn Technology, UK)
which was flushed by 1% O2.

Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Interphase FISH was performed on paraffinembedded tumor tissue sections as described [10]
using rhodamine-labeled MYCN-specific DNA probe
(QBIOgene Inc, Hamburg, Germany) and mouse Cot1 DNA probe (Life Technologies Gibco BRL, Paisley,
Scotland).
