Metastatic Cells Can Escape the Proapoptotic Effects of
TNF-a through Increased Autocrine IL-6/STAT3 Signaling
Shun Li1, Ni Wang2, and Pnina Brodt1,2

Abstract
The liver is a common site for cancer metastases in which the entrance of tumor cells has been shown to trigger
a rapid inﬂammatory response. In considering how an inﬂammatory response may affect metastatic colonization
in this setting, we hypothesized that tumor cells may acquire resistance to the proapoptotic and tumoricidal
effects of TNF-a, a cytokine that is elevated in a proinﬂammatory tissue microenvironment. In this study, we
investigated molecular mechanisms by which such resistance may emerge using tumor cells in which the
overexpression of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) enhanced the inﬂammatory and
metastatic capacities of poorly metastatic cells in the liver. Mechanistic investigations in vitro revealed that
IGF-IR overexpression increased cell survival in the presence of high levels of TNF-a, in a manner associated with
increased autocrine production of interleukin-6 (IL)-6. In turn, tumor cell–derived IL-6 induced gp130 and IL-6R–
dependent activation of STAT3, leading to reduced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. We found that IL-6
production and cell death resistance were dose dependent with increasing TNF-a levels. In addition, RNA
interference–mediated knockdown of either IL-6 or gp130 that established a blockade to autocrine STAT3
induction was sufﬁcient to abolish the prosurvival effect of TNF-a and to inhibit liver metastasis. Taken together,
our ﬁndings deﬁne an IGF-IR–mediated mechanism of cancer cell survival that is critical for metastatic
colonization of the liver. Cancer Res; 72(4); 865–75. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer metastasis remains the main cause of cancer-related
mortality. To colonize a distant site, cancer cells must complete several rate limiting steps, including detachment from
the primary site and invasion, intravasation, survival in the
circulation, extravasation, and ﬁnally, survival and growth in
the target organ (1–3). Once in the target organ, cancer cells
can induce a proinﬂammatory microenvironment involving
host leukocytes and monocytes that reside in the affected
tissue or are recruited in response to signals elaborated by
the tumor cells. These host cells can further promote the
development of secondary tumors by releasing cytokines and
chemokines such as TNF-a, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 that
promote tumor cell migration, tumor survival, and the induction of endothelial cell adhesion receptors that mediate tumor
cell arrest and transendothelial migration (4–6).

TNF-a is a pleiotropic, proinﬂammatory cytokine that can
have multiple and diametrically opposing effects on tumor cell
survival and malignant progression. Although at high concentrations, it can cause hemorrhagic necrosis, induce apoptosis,
and stimulate antitumor immunity, it can also, under the
appropriate conditions, promote tumor initiation and progression (7, 8). TNF-a is produced as a cell membrane–associated
26-kDa proprotein that can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) to release a soluble 17-kDa form (reviewed in
ref. 9). TNF-a is active as a self-assembling, noncovalently
associated trimer that binds to 2 cell surface receptors; the
p55/p60 TNFR1 and the p75/p80 TNFR2. Binding to TNFR1
triggers the recruitment of the adaptor TNFR-associated death
domain that serves as a platform to assemble alternative
signaling complexes. This can lead to activation of IKK/
IkBa/NF-kB signaling and upregulation of NF-kB target genes
such as IL-6 or the recruitment of Fas-associated death
domain-containing protein and caspase 8, leading to activation
and cleavage of the effector caspase-3 and apoptosis (10, 11).
IL-6 belongs to a family of cytokines that signal through
receptor complexes containing the signal-transducing protein
gp130 (12). It can play diverse roles both as a regulator of the
acute inﬂammatory response and as a growth and survival
factor. Binding of IL-6 to its cellular receptor IL-6Ra (CD126)
triggers the recruitment of gp130 (CD130) and results in Janusactivated kinase (JAK) activation and phosphorylation of transcription factors of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) family, particularly STAT3. Phosporylated STAT3 dimers translocate to the nucleus in which direct
DNA binding leads to transcriptional activation of various

genes, including oncogenes such as c-Myc, cell survival genes
such as Bclxl, cell-cycle regulators such as Ccnd1 (Cyclin D1),
cytokines such as Il6, and molecular modulators of angiogenesis and metastasis such as Mmp2, Mmp9, Hif1a, and Vegf (13,
14). Activation of an autocrine regulatory loop whereby IL-6
activates STAT3 and STAT3 in turn, upregulates Il6 transcription was shown to maintain cell resistance to apoptosis and
contribute to tumor progression (15). IL-6 can also bind to
gp130 via an extracellular soluble form of IL-6Ra (sIL-6R)
resulting in activation of gp130/JAK/STAT3 signaling and
enhancement of the effects of IL-6 (16).
The receptor for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGFIR) has also been identiﬁed as a survival factor for cancer cells
and implicated in cellular transformation, malignant progression, and the acquisition of an invasive/metastatic phenotype
(17). Ligand-induced activation of the intrinsic IGF-IR tyrosine
kinase can initiate several signaling pathways including the
Ras/Raf/ERK (ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway implicated in receptor-mediated mitogenesis and transformation and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway implicated in the transmission of cell survival signals.
Cross-talk with integrins and with the JAK/STAT pathway has
also been described (17–19). Upregulated expression of IGF-IR
has been documented in many types of cancers, and it has been
recognized as a therapeutic target in the treatment of malignant disease (17, 20, 21).
Previously, we have shown that lung carcinoma M-27 cells
ectopically expressing human IGF-IR acquired a liver-metastasizing potential that correlated with increased cell survival in
the liver (22). We have also shown that metastatic lung and
colon carcinoma cells that invade the liver initiate a rapid host
inﬂammatory response that entails increased production of
cytokines TNF-a and IL-1 by activated Kupffer cells and results
in increased tumor cell adhesion to local microvascular endothelial cells, transmigration, and metastasis. This ability to
induce a rapid inﬂammatory response was tumor type speciﬁc,
correlated with the liver-metastasizing potential of the cells,
and was also noted in cells with ectopic IGF-IR expression
(6, 23, 24). These results imply that metastatic tumor cells
acquire mechanisms of resistance to the proapoptotic effects
of TNF-a produced in the microenvironment of the target
organs to survive and give rise to new metastatic foci.
On the basis of these ﬁndings, we hypothesized that IGF-IR
overexpression plays a role in the acquisition of resistance to
the proapoptotic effects of TNF-a by shifting TNFR1-induced
signals from pro- to antiapoptotic. The objective of this study
was therefore to identify molecular mechanism(s) that contribute to the acquisition of TNF-a resistance in highly metastatic tumor cells and investigate the role that IGF-IR plays in
this process.

Rescue from TNF-a–Induced Apoptosis by IL-6

the cytokine TNF-a and results in increased tumor cell adhesion, transmigration, and metastasis (6, 23). This prompted us
to investigate whether the ability of metastatic cells to survive
in this local inﬂammatory microenvironment involved an
altered response to TNF-a. To this end, we used Lewis lung
carcinoma subline M-27 cells that acquired a liver-metastasizing potential following ectopic expression of the human
IGF-I receptor (M-27IGFIR cells; refs. 22, 31). We compared the
response of these, and wild type, poorly metastatic M-27 cells
to treatment with increasing concentrations of TNF-a by
measuring apoptosis with a detection system for mono-oligonucleosomes. We observed that M-27IGFIR cells had an altered
response, particularly at high TNF-a concentrations. Although
at the lower concentration of 10 ng/mL, TNF-a in serum-free
medium could partially protect both cell types from apoptosis
(50% reduction), at the higher concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/
mL, M-27IGFIR, but not M-27 cells were signiﬁcantly protected
(>85% reduction at 50 ng/mL) from cell death (Fig. 1A),
suggesting that under these conditions, TNF-a activated distinct signaling pathways in these cells.
TNFR activation can lead to the induction of caspase-3–
mediated cell apoptosis when death domain signaling predominates. We therefore analyzed caspase-3 expression and
activation levels in these cells under basal conditions and in
response to TNF-a. We found that the metastatic M-27IGFIR
cells expressed reduced caspase-3 mRNA and protein levels
relative to M-27 cells and these levels declined even further
when the cells were treated with TNF-a (Fig. 1 B and C). When
the tumor cells were treated with TNF-a, an increase in cleaved

Gene silencing by short hairpin RNA
Tumor cells cultured in 6-well plates (3  105 cells per well)
were transfected with the pRS plasmid (Origene) expressing
gp130 or IL-6 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences or a
scrambled sequence as a control, using serum-free media
containing Lipofectamine. Puromycin (4 mg/mL) was added
48 hours later and drug-resistant cells cloned by the limiting
dilution method. Clones with a stable reduction in the respective mRNA levels were selected for further study.
Experimental metastasis assay
Experimental liver metastases were generated by the intrasplenic/portal injections, as we previously described (22, 30).
Metastases visible on the surface of the liver were enumerated
and sized without prior ﬁxation. All the procedures were
approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee.
Statistical analysis
The Student t test was used for analysis of in vitro data and
the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test for analysis of metastasis data.

caspase-3 levels could be detected by Western blotting in M-27,
but not in M-27IGFIR cells (Fig. 1D), even when the protein load
for the latter cells was doubled to adjust for the relative
decrease in total caspase-3 levels (Supplementary Fig. S1). This
difference in detectable cleaved caspase-3 levels was consistent
with the reduction in apoptosis seen in M-27IGFIR cells.
Increased IL-6/STAT3 signaling in metastatic M-27IGFIR
cells
Caspase-3 production is negatively regulated by activated
STAT3. We therefore next analyzed the expression levels and
activation status of STAT3 in these cells. qRT-PCR and Western
blotting (Fig. 2A and B) revealed that basal STAT3 expression
levels in M-27IGFIR cells were actually lower than those in
nonmetastatic M-27 cells. However, activated STAT3 (pSTAT3) levels were markedly increased (4-fold) in M-27IGFIR
cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, treatment of M-27IGFIR, but not M27 cells with TNF-a for 24 hours increased p-STAT3 levels and a
further increase of 10% to 50% was seen when IGF-I was also
added (Fig. 2C and D). STAT3 activation was also observed
when M-27IGFIR cells were stimulated with TNF-a (with or
without IGF-I) for a shorter interval of 4 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S2). This indicated that upon cell treatment with TNF-a, a
signal transduction mechanism upstream of STAT3 was activated and suggested that in these cells, there was an increased
production of a STAT3-activating cytokine under basal conditions that could be further augmented by TNF-a.
IL-6 is a potent activator of JAK/STAT signaling and in both
M-27 and M-27IGFIR cells, treatment with exogenous IL-6 led to
STAT3 activation (Supplementary Fig. S3). When we measured
IL-6 mRNA expression levels and compared secreted levels in
the conditioned media by ELISA, we found that basal IL-6

mRNA levels were 2- to 4-fold higher in M-27IGFIR cells, as
shown in Fig. 3A and B, and this corresponded to an increase in
protein production levels, as shown in Fig. 3D (extreme left
bars). Furthermore, when IL-6 production was measured
following cell treatment with TNF-a, a marked difference was
observed in the response of these tumor cells. Namely, whereas
in M-27 cells, IL-6 mRNA and protein levels remained virtually
unchanged, in M-27IGFIR cells, they were highly induced, with
mRNA levels increasing 7.5- to 9.5-fold, as measured by qRTPCR (Fig. 3C) and protein production increasing up to 60-fold,
as measured by ELISA (Fig. 3D). Similarly, in murine colorectal
carcinoma MC-38 cells that are highly metastatic to the liver in
an IGF-I–dependent manner (26), IL-6 production was
markedly increased (60-fold) in response to treatment with
TNF-a (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, in both cell types, the increase in
IL-6 production was TNF-a dose dependent and could be
further augmented when the cells were treated simultaneously
with TNF-a and IGF-I (Fig. 3C–F), conﬁrming that signals
generated by ligand-activated IGF-IR could enhance transcriptional activation of IL-6. The TNF-a–inducible increase in IL-6
production was mediated mainly via NF-kB activation because
pretreatment of M-27IGFIR cells with JSH23, a cell-permeable
diamino compound that selectively blocks nuclear translocation of p65 (Rel-A; Supplementary Fig. S4), diminished the
increase in IL-6 expression due to TNF-a in the presence or
absence of IGF-I (Fig. 3G and H). In these experiments, IL-6
concentrations in the conditioned media of stimulated cells
were within a range (17–252 pg/mL) that was conﬁrmed to
activate STAT3 in these cells (see, Supplementary Fig. S5).
The soluble IL-6 receptor a (sIL-6Ra) acts as an agonist to
activate the gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway. It was therefore of
interest to analyze whether TNF-a treatment affected its

production by the tumor cells. When conditioned media
obtained from M-27 and M-27IGFIR cells before and after
TNF-a treatment were analyzed for the presence of sIL-6Ra
with Western blotting, we found that M-27IGFIR cells produced
a higher level of the soluble receptor. However, this level did not
increase following TNF-a treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6),
suggesting that the effect of TNF-a on STAT3 activation was
not due to changes in the release of sIL-6R, although its
presence per se may have contributed to enhanced STAT3
activation in these cells.
IGF-I does not directly activate STAT3 signaling in
M-27IGFIR cells
The IGF-IR has previously been implicated in STAT3 signaling (32). To assess its role in STAT3 activation in our cells,
M-27IGFIR cells were stimulated directly with IGF-I and the
effect on STAT3 phosphorylation analyzed by Western blotting. Treatment of the cells with IGF-I for up to 2 hours failed to

increase phospho-STAT3 levels (Fig. 4A) under conditions that
triggered signaling, as evidenced by rapid Akt phosphorylation
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that IGF-IR signaling could not directly
activate STAT3 in these cells and that its major effect was to
augment TNF-a/NF-kB signaling and thereby IL-6 production.
Stimulation of the cells with IGF-I for 24 hours also failed to
increase p-STAT3 levels (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting
that the presence of TNF-a was required to stimulate IL-6
production and autocrine STAT3 activation in these cells.
Moreover, STAT3 activation in response to TNF-a and IGF-I
could be inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to IL-6Ra (Fig.
4C), providing direct evidence for the involvement of IL-6 in
STAT3 activation by these ligands. To identify the signal
transduction pathway downstream of IGF-IR involved in the
enhancement of TNF-a/NF-kB–induced IL-6 transcription, we
used the chemical inhibitors LY294002 and PD98059 to block
PI3K and ERK signaling, respectively. Inhibition of PI3K signaling completely abolished the incremental increase in IL-6

production due to IGF-IR activation, while also reducing (2fold) the effect of TNF-a alone. Inhibition of ERK signaling also
reduced the increase in IL-6 production due to IGF-I, but to a
lesser extent (64%; Fig. 4D). The results implicate both pathways in IGF-I–mediated enhancement of IL-6 synthesis,
although PI3K/Akt signaling seems to play a more critical role.
Silencing of gp130 or IL-6 abolishes the antiapoptotic
effect of TNF-a
The protein gp130 is an IL-6 co-receptor required for transmitting IL-6–derived signals. We conﬁrmed that M-27IGFIR
cells express both gp130 and IL-6Ra (Supplementary Fig.
S8A). To determine the role of gp130 in maintaining STAT3
activity and the prosurvival effect of TNF-a in these cells, we
generated an M-27IGFIR cell line with a stable knockdown of
gp130 with shRNA (see Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8C). In
these cells, the transcriptional activity of STAT3 was markedly
reduced as shown by signiﬁcant downregulation of the STAT3
target genes—Il6 (>99% reduction) and Mmp2 (90% reduction)
and a concomitant upregulation (10-fold increase) in the
expression of Casp3 (Caspase-3) (Fig. 5A), conﬁrming that
gp130 signaling was essential for STAT3 activity in these cells.
When the effect of stable knockdown of gp130 on the ability of
TNF-a to rescue the tumor cells from apoptosis was analyzed,
we found that a knockdown of gp130 expression signiﬁcantly

870

decreased the ability of TNF-a to rescue M-27IGFIR cells from
apoptosis and also reversed the antiapoptotic effect seen when
the cells were cotreated with TNF-a and IGF-I (Fig. 5B).
Similarly, tumor cells in which IL-6 production in response
to TNF-a was blocked by shRNA-mediated silencing of IL-6
(Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B), completely lost the survival
advantage in the presence of high TNF-a concentrations (Fig.
5B) and could not be protected by the addition of IGF-I.
Together, these results indicated that IL-6/gp130 signaling
was essential for the prosurvival effect of TNF-a on these cells.
Loss of metastatic potential in cells with reduced
autocrine IL-6–mediated survival signaling
Finally, to assess the effect of IL-6 inhibition on tumor cell
potential to colonize the liver, we used M-27IGFIR and MC-38
cells in which IL-6 expression was stably silenced by shRNA
(Supplementary Figs. S9 and S10), as well as tumor cells treated
with a neutralizing anti–IL-6 antibody prior to injection. As
already shown above, the prosurvival effect of TNF-a (with or
without IGF-I) was abolished in M-27IGFIR cells stably transfected with IL-6 shRNA (Fig. 5B). Similarly, in MC-38 cells with
silenced IL-6 expression that resulted in reduced STAT3 activation levels (Fig. 6A), TNF-a–mediated apoptosis levels were
signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 6B). Moreover, when M-27IGFIR
cells were treated with a neutralizing antibody to murine IL-6

(but not an isotype–matched control), prior to treatment with
50 ng/mL TNF-a, the protective effect of TNF-a was completely abolished and apoptosis levels were restored to those seen
with untreated cells (Fig. 6C), clearly identifying IL-6/gp130/
STAT signaling as crucial to the prosurvival effect of TNF-a in
the different tumor cell types.
When M-27IGFIR or MC-38 cells with stable knockdown of IL6 were then inoculated into syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice via the
intrasplenic/portal route to assess their liver-colonizing potential, a signiﬁcant reduction in the number (and size) of hepatic
metastases, relative to controls was found in both groups of
mice (Fig. 7A–E), and this was also observed in mice injected
with M-27IGFIR cells pretreated with a neutralizing, anti–IL-6
antibody (Fig. 7F). Taken together, these results show that
activation of autocrine IL-6/gp130/STAT3 survival signaling in
response to TNF-a was essential for liver metastasis of these
carcinoma cells.

Discussion
Our results show that in the presence of high TNF-a concentrations, highly metastatic tumor cells could be rescued
from apoptosis by activating autocrine IL-6/gp130/STAT3
prosurvival signaling and implicate the IGF-IR axis in shifting
the balance from cell death toward IL-6 induction and cell
survival. Our ﬁnding that TNF-a can rescue cells from cell
death under conditions of serum deprivation may be particularly relevant to cell fate during the early stages of liver
metastasis when the tumor cells may encounter the combined

insult of ischemia/reperfusion due to sinusoidal vessel occlusion (33) and a surge in the local production of TNF-a, as we
and others have previously shown (23; reviewed in ref. 34). Our
results are in agreement with other studies that identiﬁed IL-6
as a survival factor in the liver both for primary hepatocellular
carcinoma (35) and for liver metastases (36). However, whereas
in those studies, IL-6 was liver derived and acting in a paracrine
fashion, our results show that in the presence of inﬂammatory
stimuli, tumor cells can activate this survival mechanism in an
autocrine fashion and thereby escape the proapoptotic effects
of the microenvironment. Of note, we did not observe a
signiﬁcant increase in circulating IL-6 levels (as measured by
ELISA) in mice injected with MC-38 and M-27IGFIR cells as
compared with noninjected controls (levels variable and ranging from 5 to 150 pg/mL in both groups). This suggests that in
the present tumor models, tumor-derived IL-6 did not have a
measurable effect on systemic IL-6 levels and also that the
contribution of paracrine IL-6 to STAT3 activation and tumor
cell survival may have been secondary to the effect of autocrine
IL-6 production and signaling. Taken together with ﬁndings by
others and our own previous data that implicated TNF-a in the
induction of endothelial cell adhesion receptors and thereby in
tumor transendothelial migration and extravasation (6, 23, 37),
this study identiﬁes a dual role for this cytokine in liver
metastasis namely, as a modiﬁer of the microenvironment on
one hand and a potential survival factor for the tumor cells on
the other.
We observed that at a lower concentration (10 ng/mL), TNFa also had an antiapoptotic effect on M-27 cells that was lost at

higher concentrations. This is consistent with observations in
other systems in which TNF-a could be shown to mediate
opposing effects at different concentrations (7). Although the
mechanism mediating the anti- and proapoptotic effects of
TNF-a in these cells remain to be fully elucidated, we have
observed that following treatment of both M-27 and M-27IGFIR

872

Cancer Res; 72(4) February 15, 2012

cells with 10 ng/mL TNF-a, the NF-kB p65/RelA protein is
activated and translocates to the nucleus (unpublished observation), in which it can directly activate transcription of
antiapoptotic factors. However, we did not observe a signiﬁcant upregulation of IL-6 expression or increased STAT3
activation in M-27 cells at any of the TNF-a concentrations
used.
In our M-27/M-27IGFIR model, the upregulation of IL-6
production in response to TNF-a depended on increased
IGF-IR expression levels in the tumor cells. We observed that
although ligand-induced activation of IGF-IR did not, in itself,
signiﬁcantly increase IL-6 production and STAT3 activation,
the activated receptor could act synergistically with TNF-a to
increase IL-6 levels. This effect was RelA/p65 dependent
because it was inhibited when p65 translocation was blocked.
It was also abolished when PI3K signaling was inhibited;
suggesting that IGF-IR/PI3K and NF-kB signaling converged
to enhance IL-6 production in these cells. This synergistic effect
was not unique to the M-27IGFIR cells as it was also observed in
the liver-metastasizing Lewis lung carcinoma variant H-59
(results not shown) and murine colon carcinoma MC-38 cells
(Fig. 3E) that express high IGF-IR levels and can also induce an
acute inﬂammatory response in the liver (26, 38), suggesting
that this survival mechanism is a broader phenomenon for
liver-metastasizing cells.
Although the cross-talk mechanism(s) between the IGF and
TNF-a axes in our cells remain(s) to be fully characterized, 2
potential interactions are likely candidates. Il6 gene expression
is activated by transcription factors NF-kB, AP-1, and C/ERB,
and IGF-IR was identiﬁed as an upstream activator of AP-1–
depended transcription (39, 40). It is possible, therefore, that
the synergistic effect of IGF-IR and TNF-a is due to the
concomitant activation of the 2 cis-acting transcription elements (NF-kB and AP-1) in the IL-6 promoter. Alternatively,
IGF-IR may increase NF-kB signaling more directly, through
the PI3K pathway. Indeed, TNF-a was identiﬁed as a direct
activator of Akt phosphorylation in premalignant keratinocytes (41), and NF-kB was shown to be activated downstream
of the PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate epithelial cells (42). This is
consistent with our ﬁnding that the IGF-I effect in our model
was PI3K dependent and suggests that IGF-IR may act directly
on the NF-kB pathway via PI3K/Akt signaling to enhance IL-6
production in response to TNF-a.
In this context, it is noteworthy that low levels of IL-6 and pSTAT3 could be detected in M-27IGFIR (but not M-27) cells
under basal conditions, even without stimulation of the cells by
exogenous IGF-I. This may be due to serum IGF-I and insulin
present in the culture medium that maintain a basal level of
IGF-IR/PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling in these cells, or to an
autocrine effect of the low levels of IGF-II (but not IGF-I)
produced by these cells (unpublished observation). Moreover,
Igf2r expression in these cells was found to be reduced 2.5-fold
relative to M-27 cells (unpublished gene array data). Because
IGF-IIR does not activate intracellular signaling and acts as a
"sink" to reduce ligand bioavailability (43), a reduction in its
levels in the presence of tumor-derived IGF-II could result in
low level autocrine IGF-IR activation and signaling that are
further enhanced in the presence of exogenous ligand.

Autocrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling in these cells may also be
enhanced by increased production of sIL-6R that acts as an
agonist to activate gp130. Although the regulatory link between
increased IGF-IR expression and the increased production of
sIL-6R in our cells is presently unknown, we have previously
shown that M-27 and M-27IGFIR cells express distinct MMP
repertoires (27, 29, 44). It is possible therefore, that cleavage of
the membrane-bound IL-6R by a proteinase preferentially
expressed or activated in M-27IGFIR cells is involved. Our
data indicate however, that TNF-a did not directly regulate
sIL-6R production levels, suggesting that its major role in
STAT3 activation was mediated through the upregulation of
IL-6.
Cross-talk between the IGF axis and the IL-6/STAT3 survival
pathway has been documented in other models. The evidence

www.aacrjournals.org

for this association is particularly strong for multiple myeloma
cells in which cosignaling by the IGF-IR and IL-6R were shown
to be critical for survival and growth (45, 46). Conversely in T
cells, the neutralization of IL-6 could partially abrogate the
antiapoptotic effect of IGF-I (47), suggesting that IGF-IR and
IL-6 signaling were interdependent in these cells. To our
knowledge, however, our results are the ﬁrst to document a
synergistic effect of IGF-IR signaling in the induction of autocrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling by TNF-a. Moreover, the data
suggest that the ability of the IGF axis to regulate IL-6 production and STAT3 signaling may be a function of the NF-kB
activation status in the cells and therefore provide insight into
the cross-talk between the IGF axis and NF-kB signaling.
In some studies, IGF-IR was identiﬁed as a direct activator of
JAK/STAT signaling (48). However, STAT3 activation was not

observed in M-27IGFIR cells stimulated with IGF-I for up to 24
hours and was blocked in the presence of an antibody to IL6Ra, while in MC-38 cells, the silencing of IL-6 reduced pSTAT3 levels. These data suggest that in the present cells,
STAT3 activation was IL-6 dependent.
The receptor gp130 is an essential component of the IL-6
receptor complex and is required for the activation of JAK/
STAT3 signaling (49). We show here that stable silencing of
gp130 or IL-6 in different metastatic tumor cells abolished the
antiapoptotic effect of TNF-a and that inhibition of IL-6
blocked hepatic metastasis. These data are further evidence
that the prosurvival effect of TNF-a depended on IL-6/gp130/
STAT3 signaling in these cells. In this respect, our ﬁndings are
in line with other studies that identiﬁed IL-6 and STAT3 as
progression factors and potential prognostic predictors and
therapeutic targets in several malignancies, including hepatocellular (50), colon (51), pancreatic (52), and gastric (53)
carcinomas that either arise in, or are commonly metastatic
to the liver.
Among the genes that are transcriptionally regulated by
STAT3 are mediators of cell death and survival (e.g., Casp3 and
Bclxl), cell-cycle progression factors (Ccnd1), cytokines and
chemokines (e.g., Il6, Ccl5), and mediators of migration (Cten),
invasion (Mmp2, Mmp9), and angiogenesis (Hif1a, Vegf; ref. 54)
that can all contribute to tumor progression and the cross-talk
between inﬂammation and carcinogenesis. We observed that
inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by gp130 silencing
signiﬁcantly decreased Il6 and Mmp2 gene expression while
also increasing Casp3 expression levels. MMP-2 was identiﬁed
as a critical mediator of liver metastasis (55), and we have
previously shown that Mmp2 is an IGF-IR/PI3K–regulated
gene in M-27IGFIR cells (44, 56). The present results suggest

that the constitutive increase in IL-6/STAT3 activity in these
cells (even in the absence of TNF-a stimulation) may also
contribute to the increased expression of MMP-2. In addition,
the increase in Casp3 expression in gp130-silenced cells conﬁrms that the prosurvival effects seen in the presence of TNF-a
were indeed linked to the STAT3-mediated reduction in caspase-3 levels.
Collectively, these results provide new insight into the
multifaceted role that the IGF axis can play in providing
survival and growth cues to cancer cells in the proinﬂammatory microenvironment of the liver. They also identify additional candidate molecules in the search for antimetastatic,
therapeutic targets.
