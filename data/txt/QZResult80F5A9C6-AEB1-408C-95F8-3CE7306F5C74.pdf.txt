BACKGROUND: Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that has become the cornerstone of metastatic or inoperable melanoma therapy
since its approval in 2011 in the United States and 2012 in Europe. This targeted therapy has shown impressive results in terms of
increased progression-free and overall survival as compared to dacarbazine. The safety profile did not include any renal manifestations at that time. METHODS: This report is the first case series of 8 patients who experienced significant to severe renal insufficiency
under vemurafenib treatment. RESULTS: This case series shows that vemurafenib may induce potentially severe acute renal failure,
including renal sequelae and persistent kidney disease in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to investigate the
effects of vemurafenib on the kidneys. Meanwhile, renal function should be closely monitored in treated patients for early detection

INTRODUCTION
The inhibition of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase B (BRAF), a serine/threonine-protein kinase in the RAS pathway of cell proliferation, was identified about a decade ago as a potential target for cancer treatment. Mutations of BRAF
have been identified especially in melanoma, the most frequent one, occurring in approximately 90% of BRAF mutant
melanomas, involves a V600E substitution (glutamic acid to valine in position 600)1 which results in sustained activation
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the absence of any growth factor signal. A recent study in
patients with invasive melanoma found a BRAF-V600 tumor mutation in 169 of 437 patients (38.7%) with 150 patients
(88.8%) presenting with a V600E mutation, 18 (10.6%) with V600K, and 1 (0.6%) with V600R.2 The recent development of BRAF-targeted agents for the treatment of advanced melanoma has produced unprecedented response rates.3,4
Vemurafenib, an inhibitor of the BRAF V600E kinase, received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in
August 2011 after the results of a phase 3 trial demonstrating a survival benefit in June 2011.5 Known serious side effects
of vemurafenib are dermatologic and hepatic (elevation of liver enzymes).6 To date, no renal alterations are reported in the
US Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of vemurafenib.7 However, the French SmPC mentions an unpublished
clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib in 132 patients with stage IV melanoma with BRAF V600
mutation, after first-line treatment failure, which reported increased urinary frequency and proteinuria as frequent adverse
events ( 1/100 to < 1/10).8 In December 2012, a few cases were reported at the meeting of the French Society of Dermatology.9,10 In the first communication, 15 of 16 patients treated with vemurafenib experienced a decrease in their renal
function under treatment. The mean decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 30.3% and occurred
within the first 2 months of treatment. Five patients also had proteinuria, and nephrotoxicity seemed to be reversible after
treatment withdrawal. In the second communication, the authors reported on 3 patients presenting with severe

photosensitivity and acute renal impairment under
vemurafenib therapy. We report here 8 cases of renal toxicity with vemurafenib treatment with thorough renal
follow-up. Table 1 presents the main characteristics of
these 8 patients’ history.
Case 1

A 71-year-old woman was hospitalized for malignant melanoma surgery of her calf in 2007. She developed brain
and lung metastases in July 2012. Her temporal metastasis
was surgically removed in August 2012, and she began
vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily in October 2012. At this
time, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 57
mL/minute/1.73 m2. One month later, serum creatinine
(SCr) increased from 90 lmol/L at baseline to 129 lmol/
L (corresponding to an eGFR decrease of approximately
35%; from 57 to 37 mL/minute/1.73 m2) with no proteinuria. She also presented with severe cutaneous rash leading to a 50% reduction in the vemurafenib dose, to 480
mg twice daily. Renal function remained stable at 37 mL/
minute/1.73 m2. Renal echography and renal artery
Doppler echography found neither obstruction nor stenosis. No renal biopsy was performed. She received radiography injected with iodinated contrast agent (ICA) in
September 2012, and her regular treatment comprised
oral fenofibrate 145 mg/day for dyslipidemia and olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide fixed oral combination 20/
12.5 mg/day for hypertension (HTN).
Case 2

A 68-year-old man underwent surgery for scapular melanoma in 2008. He had a history of HTN, dyslipidemia,
gout, and hiatal hernia. The eGFR was 66 mL/minute/
1.73 m2. In April 2012, he was hospitalized for lumbar
pains. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
300 mg/day and oxycodone 5 mg/day were started. One
week later, cerebral and thorax-abdomen-pelvis scans
revealed metastases, and vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily
was started. At this time, the patient was suffering from
vomiting due to opioids. One week later, SCr had
increased from 104 to 335 lmol/L (eGFR decrease of
approximately 74%; from 66 to 17 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
Intravenous rehydration was performed. NSAIDs, vemurafenib, and hydrochlorothiazide were stopped, and he was
transferred to the nephrology department. Echography of
the abdomen and the pelvis and renal artery Doppler
echography found neither obstruction nor stenosis. Tumor lysis syndrome was excluded. Acute tubular necrosis
with arteriosclerosis lesions was confirmed on renal
biopsy. Dermatologists decided to reintroduce
Cancer

vemurafenib, and treatment was resumed at 240 mg twice
daily, a reduction of 75% as compared to the usual dosage. SCr continued to increase and peaked at 633 lmol/L
(eGFR 5 8 mL/minute/1.73 m2) one week later. The
patient was not eligible for dialysis due to his general condition. With the support of the medical team and his family, active therapy was stopped, and the patient died 3
days later.
Case 3

A 80-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
complicating rheumatoid purpura presented with melanoma and a history of HTN. At that time, she had a stage 3
CKD (eGFR 5 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2), serum albumin
70 g/L, and edema of the legs. No renal biopsy was performed because she was on anticoagulant therapy for pulmonary embolism and the mechanism of renal disease was
unknown. In January 2012, multiple lesions on her left and
right legs were diagnosed as recurrent local metastases of
her melanoma. The thorax-abdomen-pelvis scan did not
find any distant metastases. She received radiotherapy and
vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. In March 2012, SCr had
increased from 99 to 151 lmol/L (eGFR decrease of
approximately 40%; from 50 to 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
She also had been discovered with inguinal lymph node
metastases. Serum albumin was 68 g/L. She had no more
edema of her legs. Chronic HTN treatments were stopped:
perindopril 5 mg/day, irbesartan 75 mg/day, and furosemide 40 mg/day. Vemurafenib was maintained until June
2012. Renal function gradually returned to baseline:
SCr 5 104 lmol/L, eGFR 5 47 mL/minute/1.73 m2.
Case 4

A 77-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IV M1c melanoma (liver, adrenal, and bone metastases). He had previous history of HTN. The eGFR was 62 mL/minute/
1.73 m2 and he was treated with zoledronic acid for bone
metastases (last injection in February 2011) together with
opioid analgesics. After progression on dacarbazine,
vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily was started in March
2011. At day 6, SCr increased from 107 to 128 lmol/L
(eGFR decrease of approximately 20%; from 62 to 50
mL/minute/1.73 m2). Two weeks later, SCr further
increased to 145 lmol/L (overall eGFR decrease of 30%;
from 62 to 44 mL/minute/1.73 m2), with mild proteinuria (< 1 g/day). He also presented with typical pruritic
papular eruption. Renal echography and renal artery
doppler echography found neither obstruction nor stenosis. Vemurafenib was maintained and renal function
spontaneously improved and plateaued 3 weeks later

Vemurafenib Renal Toxicity/Launay-Vacher et al

(April 2011). Vemurafenib was stopped in May 2012
because of progression. The patient died in June 2011.
He had received regular radiography examinations, with
ICA injections associated with intravenous rehydration to
prevent contrast-induced nephropathy during the course
of his disease. The last one had been performed 3 weeks
before the first signs of renal alterations.
Case 5

A 63-year-old man had stage IV M1c metastatic melanoma (liver, lymph nodes, lung, and bones). He had previous history of HTN (treated with perindopril),
hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery occlusive disease,
and presented with kidney disease (eGFR of 68 mL/minute/1.73 m2). Vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily was
started in June 2012 after progression on dacarbazine, together with zoledronic acid and opioids. One week later,
SCr increased from 82 to 116 lmol/L (eGFR decrease of
approximately 33%; from 88 to 59 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
Two weeks later, SCr further increased to 132 lmol/L
(overall eGFR decrease of 42%; from 88 to 51 mL/minute/1.73 m2) associated with mild proteinuria (0.56 g/
day). He also presented with anorexia, polyarthralgia, pruritus, mild thrombopenia without hypereosinophilia, cholestasis, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Renal
echography and renal artery doppler echography found
neither obstruction nor stenosis. Vemurafenib was continued at a reduced dose of 720 mg twice daily (25% reduction) due to grade 3 anorexia, whereas zoledronic acid was
stopped due to renal dysfunction. All side effects except
renal function (SCr stable at 133 lmol/L) improved
within 2 months. SCr subsequently further increased
from 133 to 151 lmol/L (eGFR additional decrease of
approximately 14%; from 50 to 43 mL/minute/1.73 m2)
with stable proteinuria (0.50 g/day) in September 2012.
Perindopril and vemurafenib were stopped. Ten days
later, SCr was 98 lmol/L (eGFR 5 71 mL/minute/1.73
m2). Vemurafenib therapy was reintroduced at a 50%
decreased dosage (480 mg twice daily). SCr increased
again to 121 lmol/L (eGFR 5 56 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
In December, SCr was stable at 125 lmol/L (eGFR 5 54
mL/minute/1.73 m2), corresponding to a 39% reduction
in eGFR as compared to baseline with persistent proteinuria (0.42 g/day). He had received regular radiography
injected with ICA with intravenous rehydration prevention measures during the course of his disease.
Case 6

In May 2012, a 41-year-old man was diagnosed with stage
IV metastatic melanoma (inguinal lymph node). The
Cancer

initial staging of the tumor found retroperitoneal adenocarcinoma with retroperitoneal adipose tissue injury, right
psoas muscle lesion, and multiple bone metastases including the axial skeleton. There was no obstruction of the urinary tract. He was not receiving any other treatment and
eGFR was 83 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Vemurafenib 960 mg
twice daily was started in July 2012. Two weeks later, SCr
increased from 93 to 146 lmol/L (eGFR decrease of
approximately 40%; from 83 to 49 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
Vemurafenib was stopped. Two weeks later, SCr had
decreased to 108 lmol/L (eGFR 5 70 mL/minute/1.73
m2). Vemurafenib was then started again, at a reduced
dose of 720 mg twice daily (25% reduction). A computed
tomography scan was performed and found a partial
response with no new injury or urinary tract obstruction.
SCr increased again, from 108 to 143 lmol/L (eGFR
decrease of approximately 30% from 70 to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2). One week later, vemurafenib treatment
was withheld for renal toxicity and disease progression
(brain metastases). One week later, renal function had
improved again (eGFR 5 62 mL/minute/1.73 m2) and
completely recovered in December (eGFR 5 85 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
Case 7

A 69-year-old man had melanoma with multiple metastases (inguinal nodes, lung, and liver). He had previous history and treatment for prostatic hyperplasia, ischemic
cardiopathy, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). He
also had untreated HTN and stage 3 CKD with an eGFR
of 57 mL/minute/1.73 m2. In October 2011, vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily was started. He had undergone a
computed tomography scan with ICA injection prior to
the initiation of vemurafenib. One month later, SCr had
increased from 118 to 140 lmol/L (eGFR decrease of
approximately 19%; from 57 to 46 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
Renal echography found no pyelocaliceal cavity distension. No renal artery doppler echography was performed.
He was not tested for proteinuria. The patient also had
photosensitivity, hepatic cytolysis and cholestasis, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Vemurafenib was
maintained. Monthly renal function follow-up was performed for 5 months and retrieved stable eGFR at 46 mL/
minute/1.73 m2. During this period, 2 computed tomography scans were also performed and found a partial
response. Antihypertensive therapy was introduced (nicardipine and ramipril). In May 2012, the patient progressed
(inguinal lymph node, pulmonary, and brain metastases).
The eGFR was 40 mL/minute/1.73 m2 at that time,
before the scan was performed. Vemurafenib was switched
2161

Original Article

to fotemustine. SCr rapidly decreased from 151 to 117
lmol/L within a week on new therapy (eGFR increase of
approximately 26%; from 42 to 57 mL/minute/1.73 m2).
One month later, eGFR was 82 mL/minute/1.73 m2 and
the patient had lost much weight. He died in July 2012.
Case 8

A 61-year-old man had surgery on his anal margin melanoma in 2004 (ulcerative, Breslow 6 mm, inguinal lymph
node metastases). He underwent another surgery for metastatic recurrence at the inguinal lymph node in 2006. At
this time, he had normal renal function (eGFR > 90 mL/
minute/1.73 m2). Inguinal lymph node metastasis
recurred in 2009 and the patient was treated with surgery
and chemotherapy for 1 year (9 cycles of cisplatin, carmustine, and dacarbazine and 3 cycles of dacarbazine
alone). At that time, he had stage 3 CKD (eGFR 5 57
mL/minute/1.73 m2), HTN, and a history of ischemic
cerebral vascular disease. Computed tomography scan
found pulmonary metastases in April 2012. Vemurafenib
960 mg twice daily was started. Olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination therapy was added to his previous HTN treatment. He also received an ICA-injected
scan 2 days before vemurafenib initiation. eGFR was 51
mL/minute/1.73 m2. One month later, SCr increased
from 133 to 211 lmol/L (eGFR decrease of approximately 40%; from 51 to 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) with
mild proteinuria (0.18 g/day) and traces of hematuria.
Vemurafenib was maintained at the same dosage but the
dosage of olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was reduced.
Nevertheless, 1 month later SCr had further increased to
283 lmol/L (eGFR 20 mL/minute/1.73 m2). Hematuria
had disappeared and proteinuria was stable (0.36 g/day).
Renal echography found no pyelocaliceal cavity distension. No renal artery doppler echography was performed.
He also had hepatic cytolysis and cholestasis and iatrogenic acne. Olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination was stopped and hydration therapy started.
Vemurafenib dose was reduced by 25%, to 720 mg twice
daily because of hepatic dysfunction. SCr increased to
182 lmol/L (eGFR 5 35 mL/minute/1.73 m2). The renal function was monitored monthly and stabilized
approximately 43 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Proteinuria persisted, but remained stable (0.35 g/day). The patient is
still being treated with vemurafenib.
DISCUSSION
These patients experienced renal dysfunction while being
treated with vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma. Renal
function (eGFR) decrease varied between 20% to 74%
2162

from baseline, probably depending on the simultaneous
use of nephrotoxic drugs, such as NSAIDs, ICA, cisplatin,
zoledronic acid, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and/
or other risk factors such as disease progression or dehydration. Interestingly, all patients but one (Case 6) had
HTN. The age of the patients ranged from 41 to 80 years.
Two patients had normal renal function at baseline, 3 had
stage 3 CKD, and 3 had an eGFR < 70 mL/minute/1.73 m2.
One patient had deep acute renal failure, which would
have required dialysis. No specific treatment of these acute
renal failures was tested.
Renal function either recovered after vemurafenib
was stopped (Cases 5, 6, and 7), improved while treatment was maintained (Cases 3 and 4) or did not recover
despite treatment withdrawal (Cases 1 and 2). In 3
patients, renal function recovered on vemurafenib treatment withdrawal, and decreased again once vemurafenib
was re-introduced, even at reduced doses (Cases 2, 5, and
6). One patient had a renal biopsy, which revealed signs of
acute tubular necrosis. Proteinuria was not systematically
explored but happened in 50% of cases when searched (2
patients on 4 with urinary dipstick available). As in the
observations of Regnier-Rosencher et al, 3 of our patients
had associated severe photosensitivity.10 The mean
decrease in eGFR was approximately 35% and happened
within the first 2 months of therapy, similar to the findings in Uthurriague et al.9
Conclusions

These cases confirm that renal toxicity may occur under
treatment with vemurafenib. Acute tubular necrosis was
diagnosed in one case. However, other mechanisms could
be involved, and further studies are needed to investigate
vemurafenib effects on the kidneys. Meanwhile, renal
function should be closely monitored in vemurafenibtreated patients for early detection of any renal dysfunction occurrence.
