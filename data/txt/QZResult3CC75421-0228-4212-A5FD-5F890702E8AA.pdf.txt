Abstract

Author Manuscript

Major international projects are now underway aimed at creating a comprehensive catalog of all
genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve sequencing of
matched tumor–normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in
which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here, we describe a
fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of
putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds.
The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the
muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false positive findings that overshadow true driver
events. Here, we show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide
a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to
exome sequences from 3,083 tumor-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in (i)
mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which shed light on mutational processes
and disease etiology, and (ii) mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated
with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational
heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual
findings and allow true cancer genes to rise to attention.
Recent cancer genome studies have led to the identification of scores of cancer genes, in
glioblastoma1, ovarian2, colorectal3, lung4, head-and-neck5, multiple myeloma6, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia7, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma8,9, and many other cancers. Studies
are now underway through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (http://

The expectation has been that larger sample sizes will increase the power both to detect true
cancer driver genes (sensitivity) and to distinguish them from the background of random
mutations (specificity). Alarmingly, recent results appear to show the opposite phenomenon:
with large sample sizes, the list of apparently significant cancer genes grew rapidly and
implausibly. For example, when we applied current analytical methods to whole-exome
sequence data from 178 tumor-normal pairs of lung squamous cell carcinoma10, a total of
450 genes (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Method S2) were found to be mutated
at a significant frequency (false-discovery rate q < 0.1). While the list contains some genes
known to be associated with cancer, many of the genes seem highly suspicious based on
their biological function or genomic properties. Almost a quarter (101/450) of the putative
significant genes encode olfactory receptors. The list is also highly enriched for genes
encoding extremely large proteins, including more than one-fifth of the 83 genes encoding
proteins with >4,000 amino acids (p<10−11, Fisher’s exact test). These include the two
longest human proteins, the muscle protein titin (36,800 amino acids) and the membraneassociated mucin MUC16 (14,500 amino acids), as well as another mucin (MUC4), cardiac
ryanodine receptors (RYR2, RYR3), cytoskeletal dyneins (DNAH5, DNAH11), and the
neuronal synaptic vesicle protein piccolo (PCLO). The prominence of these genes is not
simply the consequence of their long coding regions, because the statistical tests already
account for the larger target size. Furthermore, the list also contains genes with very long
introns, including one-sixth of the 73 genes spanning a genomic region of >1Mb (p<10−6),
such as those encoding cub- and-sushi-domain proteins (CSMD1, CSMD3), and many
neuronal proteins, such as the neurexins NRXN1, NRXN4 (CNTNAP2), CNTNAP4, and
CNTNAP5, the neural adhesion molecule CNTN5, and the Parkinson protein PARK2. When
we performed similar analyses for several other cancer types with many samples, we
similarly obtained large lists including many of the same genes (data not shown).
After recognizing the problem of apparent false-positive findings, we reviewed the
published literature and found that some of these potentially spurious genes have already
cropped up in recently published cancer genome studies, for example: LRP1B in
glioblastoma (GBM)2 and lung adenocarcinoma1,4; CSMD3 in ovarian cancer2; PCLO in
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)9; MUC16 in lung squamous carcinoma11, breast
cancer12 and DLBCL8; MUC4 in melanoma13; olfactory receptor OR2L13 in GBM14; and
TTN in breast cancer12 and other tumor types15. We therefore set out to understand the
source of the problem.

Analytical approaches in wide use today1-9,13-16 identify as significantly mutated those
genes harboring more mutations than expected given the average background mutation
frequency for the cancer type. These methods employ a handful of parameters: an average
overall mutation frequency for a cancer type and a few parameters about the relative
frequencies of different categories of mutations (small insertions/deletions and transitions
vs. transversions at CpG dinucleotides, other C:G basepairs and A:T basepairs). Average
values of these parameters are typically estimated from the samples under study. Various

efforts, by us and others, have recently began to incorporate sample-specific mutation rates
into the analysis.3,9

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that the problem might be due to heterogeneity in the mutational processes
in cancer. While it is obvious that assuming an average mutation frequency that is too low
will lead to spuriously significant findings, it is less well appreciated that using the correct
average rate but failing to account for heterogeneity in the mutational process can also
wreak havoc. To illustrate this point, we compared two simple scenarios both sharing the
same average mutation frequency: (a) constant frequency of 10 mutations per megabase
(10/Mb) across all genes, versus (b) frequencies of 4/Mb, 8/Mb and 20/Mb in 25%, 50% and
25% of genes, respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). If one analyzes the second case
under the erroneous assumption of a constant rate, many of the highly mutable genes will
falsely be declared to be cancer genes. Notably, the problem grows with sample size:
because the threshold for statistical significance decreases with sample size, modest
deviations due to an erroneous model are declared significant. For the same reason, the
problem is also more pronounced in tumor types with higher mutation rates. Heterogeneity
in mutation frequencies across patients can also lead to inaccurate results, including the
potential to produce both false-positive, as described above, and false-negative results if the
baseline frequency is overestimated.

Author Manuscript

We therefore set out to study heterogeneity in mutation rates, in a data set of 3,083 tumor/
normal pairs across 27 tumor types, with 2,957 having whole-exome sequence and 126
having whole-genome sequence (Supplementary Table S2). Approximately 92% of the
samples were sequenced at the Broad Institute and thus were processed using a uniform
experimental and analytical pipeline (see Methods). In this data set, an average of 30 Mb of
coding sequence per sample was covered to adequate depth for mutation detection, yielding
a total of 373,909 nonsilent coding mutations or an average of 4.0/Mb per sample (median
of 44 nonsilent coding mutations per sample, or 1.5/Mb).
We analyzed three types of heterogeneity, with the aim of achieving more accurate detection
of cancer genes.

(i) Heterogeneity across patients with a given cancer type

Author Manuscript

Analysis of the 27 cancer types revealed that the median frequency of non-synonymous
mutations varied by more than 1000-fold across cancer types (Figure 1). About half of the
variation in mutation frequencies (measured on a logarithmic scale) can be explained by
tissue type of origin. Pediatric cancers showed frequencies as low as 0.1/Mb (approximately
one change across the entire exome), while at the opposite extreme, melanoma and lung
cancer exceeded 100/Mb. The high mutation frequencies are in some cases attributable to
extensive exposure to well known carcinogens, such as UV radiation in the case of
melanoma and tobacco smoke in the case of lung cancers.
More surprisingly, mutation frequencies varied dramatically across patients within a cancer
type. In melanoma and lung cancer, the frequency ranged across 0.1 - 100/Mb. Despite the
low median frequency in AML (0.37/Mb), the patient-specific frequencies similarly spanned

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 February 10.

three orders of magnitude 0.01 - 10/Mb. Variation may in some cases be due to key
biological factors, such as melanomas not attributed to UV exposure or on unexposed skin,
colon cancers with or without mismatch repair defects3, or head and neck tumors with viral
or non-viral origin5 (Supplementary Figure S2).

(ii) Heterogeneity in mutational spectrum

Author Manuscript

In addition to total mutation frequency, we examined the mutational spectrum in each tumor.
Starting with all 96 possible mutations (12 mutations at a base times 16 possible flanking
bases then collapsed by strand symmetry), we used non-negative matrix factorization to
reduce the dimensionality, with each spectrum represented as a linear combination of six
basic spectra (Methods). We represented the mutational spectrum of each tumor on a
circular plot, with distance from the origin representing total mutation rate and angle
representing the relative contribution of the six basic spectra (Figure 2). This representation
reveals natural groupings with respect to mutational spectrum.
Lung cancers, for example, (red cluster at 2 o’clock position), share a mutational spectrum
dominated by C→A mutations, consistent with their exposure to the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke17. Melanoma (black cluster at 12 o’clock) shows a distinct
pattern reflecting the frequent C→T mutations caused by misrepair of UV-induced covalent
bonds between adjacent pyrimidines18. Gastrointenstinal tumors (esophageal, colororectal,
and gastric, corresponding to green cluster at 8 o’clock) show extremely high frequencies of
transition mutations at CpG dinucleotides, which may reflect higher methylation levels in
these tumor types3.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Interestingly, there is a multifarious cluster at the 10 o’clock position corresponding to
cervical, head-and-neck, and bladder tumors, all sharing frequent mutations at C’s in the
context TpC that change the C to either T or G or (less often) A. This pattern is
characteristic of mutations caused by the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, innate
immunity enzymes restricting propagation of retroviruses and retrotransposons19,20. Some
APOBECs can be induced by certain classes of viruses21. Cervical cancer is known to be
caused in over 90% of cases by the human papillomavirus (HPV)22. Recent studies have
also implicated HPV in head-and-neck cancers5. The similar mutational spectrum in bladder
cancer may indicate a viral etiology in a significant subset of this tumor type; a potential role
of HPV in bladder cancer is a subject of active investigation23. This cluster also contains
sporadic examples of breast tumors (consistent with a recent report12), as well as some
tumors from lung and other tissues. Recent work19,20 has shown that the TpC mutations tend
to occur in proximity to one another, consistent with the activity of APOBEC enzymes in
damaged long single-strand DNA regions. One last minor cluster (4 o’clock position)
consists of samples dominated by A→T mutations in the context TpA. This cluster contains
mostly leukemia samples (AML and CLL), as well as one breast sample and one
neuroblastoma sample.
In summary, the rich variation in mutational spectrum across tumors underscores the
problems with using an overly simplistic model of the average mutational process for a
tumor type and failing to account for heterogeneity within a tumor type.

(iii) Heterogeneity across the genome
Of all the kinds of heterogeneity in mutational processes, the most important effect turns out
to be regional heterogeneity across the genome. By examining whole-genome sequence
from 126 tumor-normal pairs across ten tumor types, we found striking variation in mutation
frequency across the genome, with differences exceeding 5-fold (Figure 3a,b); the profile of
the genomic variation was similar across and within tumor types (Figure S3). Recent studies
have noted regional variation in cancer mutation rates and begun to explore correlations with
genomic features6,17,18,24.

We focused on two factors that were especially powerful in explaining mutational
heterogeneity. The first factor is gene expression level. It is known that the germline
mutation rate is somewhat lower in genes that are highly expressed in the germline18, due to
a process termed transcription-coupled repair25. With the whole-genome and whole-exome
data analyzed here, we found a strong correlation between somatic mutation frequency in
cancers and gene expression level (averaged across many cell lines, with similar results for
expression in matched normal tissue) (Figure 3a,b; Supplementary Figure S3;
Supplementary Tables S4, S5). The average mutation rate is ~2.9-fold higher than the
bottom percentile than in the top percentile. While statistically highly significant, this effect
is insufficient to fully explain regional variation in mutation levels. The second important
factor is the replication time of a DNA region during the cell cycle. Recent studies have
reported that germline mutation rates are correlated with DNA replication time26-28: latereplicating regions have much higher mutation rates, possibly due to depletion of the pool of
free nucleotides26. With the whole-genome and whole-exome data here, we see a striking
correlation between somatic mutation frequency in cancers and DNA replication timing (as
measured in HeLa cells27) (Figure 3a,b), with similar results for blood cell lines28 (Figure
S3). The average mutation rate is ~2.9-fold higher in the latest- versus earliest-replicating
percentile, and ~2.1-fold difference between the latest- and earliest-replicating decile.

Author Manuscript

These two features explain most of the suspicious entries on the putative cancer gene lists.
Olfactory receptor genes, for example, have low expression (p<10−172, KolmogorovSmirnoff test, Figure 3e), are strikingly late in replication timing (p<10−109, Figure 3f), and
show a high regional noncoding mutation rate (p<10−81), which accounts for the high
frequency of somatic mutations in their coding regions. Large genes are similarly lowexpressed and late-replicating (Figure 3e,f), including the genes cited in the lung cancer
example above, such as titin and the ryanodine receptors. Importantly, these results
undermine the evidence supporting several recent reports – such as the suggestion that
CSMD3 is a cancer gene in ovarian cancer2. As an independent test, we confirmed that these
two genomic features correlated strongly with the overall frequency of silent substitutions in
coding regions and mutations in introns (Figure 3c,d; Supplementary Table S6). We note,
however, that silent substitutions alone provide inadequate data to correct mutation
frequencies on a gene-by-gene basis in most tumor types and for most genes, due to the
sparsity of the data and the resulting uncertainty in estimated rates.
Using the observations above, we developed a new integrated approach to identify
significantly mutated genes in cancer. The method (MutSigCV) corrects for variation by

employing (i) patient-specific mutation frequency and spectrum, and (ii) gene-specific
background mutation rates incorporating expression level and replication time
(Supplementary Methods 3). MutSigCV is freely available for noncommercial use (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutsig).
When we applied MutSigCV to the lung cancer example above, the list of significantly
mutated genes shrank from 450 to 11 genes. Most of the genes in this shorter list have been
previously reported to be mutated in squamous cell lung cancer (TP53, KEAP1, NFE2L2,
CDKN2A, PIK3CA, PTEN, RB111,16) or other tumor types (MLL2, NOTCH1, FBXW7). An
additional novel gene in the list, HLA-A,suggests that mutations in immune-related genes
may help tumors evade immune surveillance, a finding that requires follow-up experimental
work. These significantly mutated genes are discussed in the TCGA lung squamous
publication10, in which we applied our novel methodology.

Author Manuscript

With the ability to eliminate many obviously suspicious genes, it is now feasible to start
analyzing large cancer collections, including combined data sets across many cancer types.
We note that other forms of heterogeneity in tumors merit further investigation. These
include the co-occurrence of many mutations in proximity to each other (“kataegis”19 or
“clustered mutations”20) (see Supplementary Figure S10) and transcription-coupled repair
(see Supplementary Figure S11). In addition, heterogeneity across cancer cells within a
tumor, reflecting the evolutionary process of a tumor, will be crucial to fully understand.29

Author Manuscript

Our results make clear that the accurate identification of new cancer genes will require
accurate accounting of mutational processes. While MutSigCV resolves the most serious
current problems, the ultimate solution will likely involve using empirically observed local
mutation rates obtained from massive amounts of whole-genome sequencing.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

All samples were obtained under institutional IRB approval and with documented informed
consent. A complete list of samples is given in Table S2. Whole-exome capture libraries
were constructed and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq flowcells to average coverage of 118x.
Whole-genome sequencing was done with the Illumina GA-II or Illumina HiSeq sequencer,
achieving an average of ~30X coverage depth. Reads were aligned to the reference human
genome build hg19 using an implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, and a BAM
file was produced for each tumor and normal sample using the Picard pipeline6. The
Firehose pipeline was used to manage input and output files and submit analyses for
execution. The MuTect30 and Indelocator (Sivachenko, A. et al., manuscript in preparation)
algorithms were used to identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (SSNVs) and short
somatic insertions and deletions, respectively. Mutation spectra were analyzed using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Significantly mutated genes were identified using
MutSigCV, which estimates the background mutation rate (BMR) for each gene-patientcategory combination based on the observed silent mutations in the gene and noncoding
mutations in the surrounding regions. Because in most cases these data are too sparse to
obtain accurate estimates, we increased accuracy by pooling data from other genes with

similar properties (e.g. replication time, expression level). Significance levels (p-values)
were determined by testing whether the observed mutations in a gene significantly exceed
the expected counts based on the background model. False Discovery Rates (q-values) were
then calculated, and genes with q≤0.1 were reported as significantly mutated. Full methods
details are listed in Supplementary Information.

Somatic mutation frequencies observed in exomes from 3,083 tumor-normal pairs. Each dot
corresponds to a tumor-normal pair, with vertical position indicating the total frequency of
somatic mutations in the exome. Tumor types are ordered by their median somatic mutation
frequency, with the lowest frequencies (left) found in hematological and pediatric tumors,
and the highest (right) in tumors induced by carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and UV
light. Mutation frequencies vary more than 1000-fold between lowest and highest mutation
rates across cancer and also within several tumor types. The lower panel shows the relative
proportions of the six different possible base-pair substitutions, as indicated in the legend on
the left. (See also Supplementary Table S2.)

Radial spectrum plot of the 2,892 tumor samples having at least 10 coding mutations. The
angular space is compartmentalized into the six different factors discovered by NMF (see
Methods). The distance from the center represents the total mutation frequency. Different
tumor types segregate into different compartments based on their mutation spectra. Notable
examples are: lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous carcinoma (red; 2 o’clock position),
melanoma (black; 12 o’clock position), stomach, esophageal and colorectal cancer (various
shades of green; 8 o’clock position), samples harboring mutations of the HPV or APOBEC
signature (bladder, cervical and head and neck cancer, marked in yellow, orange, and blue
respectively; 10 o’clock position), and AML and CLL samples sharing the Tp*A→T
signature, 4 o’clock position. (See also Supplementary Table S3.)

Mutation rate varies widely across the genome and correlates with DNA replication time and
expression level. (a,b) Mutation rate, replication time, and expression level plotted across
selected regions of the genome. Red shows total noncoding mutation rate calculated from
whole-genome sequences of 126 samples (excluding exons). Blue shows replication time27.
Green shows average expression level across 91 cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE), determined by RNA sequencing. (Note that low expression is at the
top of the scale and high expression at the bottom, in order to emphasize the mutual
correlations with the other variables). Shown are (a) entire chromosome 14 and (b) portions
of chromosomes 1 and 8, with the locations of two specific loci: a cluster of 16 olfactory
receptors on chr1 and the gene CSMD3 on chr8. These two loci have very high mutation
rates, late replication times, and low expression levels. (The local mutation rate at CSMD3 is
even higher than predicted from replication time and expression, suggesting contributions
from additional factors, perhaps locally increased DNA breakage: the locus is a known
fragile site). (c,d) Correlation of mutation rate with expression level and replication time, for
all 100 Kb windows across the genome. (e,f) Cumulative distribution of various gene
families as a function of expression level and replication time. Olfactory receptor genes,
genes encoding long proteins (>4,000aa) and genes spanning large genomic loci (>1Mb) are
significantly enriched towards lower expression and later replication. In contrast, known
cancer genes (as listed in the Cancer Gene Census) trend toward slightly higher expression
and earlier replication. (See also Supplementary Figure S9 and Supplementary Tables S4,
S5, S6.)
