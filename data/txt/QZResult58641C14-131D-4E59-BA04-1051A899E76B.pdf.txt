ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer growth is dependent upon the Androgen Receptor (AR) pathway,
hence therapies for this disease often target this signalling axis. Such therapies
are successful in the majority of patients but invariably fail after a median of
2 years and tumours progress to a castrate resistant stage (CRPC). Much evidence
exists to suggest that the AR remains key to CRPC growth and hence remains a
valid therapeutic target. Here we describe a novel method to inhibit AR activity,
consisting of an interaction motif, that binds to the AR ligand-binding domain, fused to
repression domains. These ‘engineered repressors’ are potent inhibitors of AR activity
and prostate cancer cell growth and importantly inhibit the AR under circumstances
in which conventional therapies would be predicted to fail, such as AR mutation and
altered cofactor levels.

INTRODUCTION

the activity of transcription factors while not directly
binding DNA themselves. Steroid receptor coactivators,
such as the p160 family, often interact with the AF-2
surface of agonist-bound nuclear receptors, via an
α-helical LxxLL motif [7, 8]. However, the AR differs
from other steroid receptors in that it has greater affinity
for phenylalanine rich motifs, such as the FQNLF motif
found in the N-terminus of the AR that mediates the N-/Cterminal interaction, and those found in coactivators such
as ARA70 [9-11]. This difference in interaction motif
preference between steroid receptors is a result of a deeper
coactivator interaction groove on the surface of the active
(holo) form of the AR LBD, which can accommodate the
bulkier phenylalanine residues [10, 12]. Conversely AR,
like other steroid receptors, can interact with corepressor
proteins (such as NCoR) in the presence of antagonists,
which promote a different LBD conformation [13-15].
Corepressors bind to the LBD of nuclear receptors at
a distinct region that nevertheless overlaps with the
coactivator-interacting region and subsequently inhibit
transcription of target genes [13, 16].
Prostate cancer growth is almost always dependent
upon the androgen-signalling axis and as a result,

The Androgen Receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent
transcription factor and like other members of the Nuclear
Receptor family, has a modular structure consisting
of the N-terminal domain, the central DNA-binding
domain and the C-terminal ligand-binding domain [1].
The receptor contains two activation functions (AF),
the predominant AF-1 in the N-terminus and the weaker
ligand dependent AF-2 in the ligand binding domain
(LBD) [2]. In the absence of ligand the receptor is
localised in the cytoplasm, associated with a heat shock
protein complex that holds the receptor in a ligand
binding competent conformation. Upon ligand binding
the receptor undergoes a conformational change, which
promotes nuclear localisation, dimerization, recruitment
of accessory proteins and an intramolecular N-/C-terminal
interaction [3]. The N-/C-terminal interaction is important
in reducing ligand off rate and increasing receptor
stability [4]. The importance of this interaction in AR
transcriptional activity, however, appears to be promoter
specific [5, 6].

RESULTS

androgen deprivation therapy is a common treatment
option for this disease. This involves one or both of
chemical castration to ablate circulating androgens and
antiandrogens – steroidal or non-steroidal ligands that
bind to the AR LBD but do not promote subsequent
target gene activation, either due to simple competition,
by preventing receptor dimerization and/or nuclear
translocation and DNA-binding, by promoting formation
of a repressive complex at the androgen response element
(ARE), or a mixture of mechanisms [15, 17]. Although
antiandrogens are initially successful in the majority of
patients, relapse is inevitable and the tumours progress
to a “castrate resistant” stage (CRPC), for which few
therapeutic options exist. Much evidence exists to
suggest that the AR is still driving growth, even in the
androgen-depleted environment, including frequent
AR amplification and mutation, as well as alterations
in cofactor levels and activities [18]. The AR therefore
remains a valid target for CRPC and novel methods to
inhibit the AR are required. Ideally such therapies would
be active even in circumstances where current therapies
would be predicted to fail (e.g. mutations of the AR
resulting in broadened ligand preference and promiscuous
activation [11]).
Due to the limited efficacy of current antiandrogens,
novel methods to inhibit AR signalling are being devised
that directly target different regions of the AR. Zhang
et al., for example, demonstrated that ectopic expression
of a decoy androgen response element was successful at
reducing AR activity [19]. Other studies demonstrated
that targeting either the AF-1 or AF-2 of the AR using
peptides, can successfully inhibit AR activity [20-22].
These consist of specific AR-binding motifs, which
subsequently block crucial interactions such as the
N-/C-terminal interaction and recruitment of coactivators.
Another approach is the engineering of AR-specific
corepressors. Reeb et al. performed a yeast 2-hybrid
peptide screen against the full-length AR in the presence
of the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide [23]. Fusion of the
lead interacting peptide with a silencing domain generated
an AR corepressor with receptor specific inhibitory
effects.
Here we describe the design and validation of
AR engineered repressors that combine the desirable
characteristics of coactivators and corepressors, in
that they interact with the AR when it is in a holo
conformation and block its activity. These consist of an
interaction motif containing an FxxLF motif, fused to
potent repression domains. Importantly, we demonstrate
that these factors are successful in inhibiting the AR in
circumstances thought to lead to castrate resistant prostate
cancer.

Engineered repressor design
Previous studies have demonstrated that peptides
designed to target intra- and inter-receptor interactions
can successfully inhibit AR activity [20, 21]. For example,
peptides consisting of an FxxLF α-helix, which can bind
to AF-2 of the AR, inhibit the N-/C-terminal interaction
and reduce AR activity [21]. In an attempt to make a more
potent inhibitor of the AR, we fused amino acids 1-54
of the AR, which contains the 23FQNLF27 motif known
to interact with the AR LBD (termed the interaction
motif), to known repression domains from different
proteins: MAD (amino acids 7-35 [24]), KOX (amino
acids 1-75 [25]) and PLZF (amino acids 1-452 [26]). The
resulting constructs are MAD7-35-AR1-54, KOX1-75-AR1-54,
PLZF1-452-AR1-54 (Figure 1a). These repressors should not
only sterically disrupt coactivator binding and the N-/Cterminal interaction, but also bring a potent repression
domain in close proximity to the receptor upon activation
by ligand.

The engineered repressors interact with the active
Androgen Receptor
As proof of principle to confirm that the repressors
and the AR interact, MAD7-35-AR1-54 was fused to GFP and
co-transfected into COS-1 cells with an AR expression
vector. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that MAD7-35AR1-54 is predominantly nuclear and appears to colocalise
with the agonist bound AR (Figure 1b), suggesting that
the proteins interact. This interaction was confirmed
using co-immunoprecipitation, whereby a GFP antibody
(against the MAD7-35-AR1-54 construct) also pulled-down
full-length AR (Figure 1c). Importantly, this interaction
was ligand-dependent, as would be expected since the
interaction of 23FQNLF27 within AR1-54 with the AR ligand
binding domain is dependent upon AF-2 being in an active
conformation [27].

The engineered repressors inhibit Androgen
Receptor activity
To investigate the repressive activity of the
engineered repressors compared to the interaction motif
and repression domains in isolation, each was transfected
into COS-1 cells along with an AR expression plasmid
and an androgen-responsive luciferase reporter gene.
The N-terminal 54 amino acid fragment of AR expressed
in isolation reduced AR activity by 34% (Figure 2a).
Repression domains in isolation had no effect on AR
activity (Figure 2a, solid lines), but when fused to AR1-54

the resulting fusion constructs had greater inhibitory action
than the interaction motif alone: maximal repression for
AR1-54- KOX1-75 was 57%, for MAD7-35-AR1-54 was 81%
and for PLZF1-452-AR1-54 was 86% (Figure 2a, broken

line used or transiently transfected AR, PC3-WTAR cells

in the COS-1 cell line, the engineered repressors potently
inhibited AR activity in PC3 cells (Figure 2b).

which should be specific for the AR. To investigate if the

The engineered repressors successfully block
Androgen Receptor activity in circumstances that
promote hormone therapy failure

and progesterone receptor activity by <40% compared to
approximately 80% inhibition of the AR (Figure 2c).
To confirm that both the interaction domain and
repression domain were required for inhibitory action,
point mutations were introduced into these domains and
activity measured using transcription assays. Mutation
of the FQNLF interaction motif to FQNAA abolished
repressive activity of MAD7-35-AR1-54 (Figure 3a). To
confirm that the repression domain also contributes to
repressive potential, mutations were introduced in to the
repression motif of the MAD7-35AR1-54 vector. Mutation
of residues L12 and A16 to prolines disrupted intrinsic
transrepression activity (Supplementary Figure 1 and
[24]). Fusion of the mutated MAD7-35 repression domain
with AR1-54 generated a repressor with markedly weaker
repressive activity compared to wild-type MAD7-35AR1-54
(Figure 3b). We therefore conclude that fusion of an
interaction motif with a repression domain generates a
potent repressor of AR activity and that both domains are
essential for maximal inhibitory potential.

Much evidence exists to suggest that the AR can
drive CRPC growth. One possible mechanism to explain
therapy failure leading to CRPC is alterations in levels
and/or activities of AR co-regulators sensitising the
pathway to low levels or weakly androgenic ligands.
Indeed, Gregory et al., demonstrated that the coactivators
SRC1 (Steroid Receptor Coactivator 1) and TIF2
(transcriptional intermediary factor 2) were over-expressed
in the majority of CRPCs [29], and altered expression and
localisation of AR corepressors in prostate cancer has
also been described (for example [30-34]). To determine
whether the engineered repressors can inhibit AR activity
enhanced by coactivator over-expression, COS1 cells were
transfected with expression plasmids for the AR, SRC1
and increasing amounts of engineered repressor. SRC1
enhanced AR activity by 2.5-fold and the LBD interaction

motif (AR1-54) was unable to compete with this enhanced
activity (Figure 4a). By contrast, the engineered repressors
were all able to significantly reduce the SRC1-enhanced
AR activity (Figure 4b-d).
Mutations in the AR gene are rare in the early
stages of prostate cancer, but their frequency increases
significantly in advanced stages of the disease [35, 36]. For
example, Gaddipati et al. found the T877A substitution
in 25% of metastatic PCa samples analysed [37]. Some
mutations appear to offer a growth advantage by reducing
ligand specificity, allowing non-androgen ligands such

as the antiandrogens cyproterone acetate (CPA) and
hydroxyflutamide (OHF) to activate the receptor. To
investigate if the engineered repressors can inhibit
mutant ARs activated by these antiandrogens, COS-1
cells were transfected with two AR mutants commonly
associated with prostate cancer (H874Y and T877A) and
the engineered repressors. AR mutants H874Y and T877A
were activated by mibolerone and to a lesser extent by CPA
and OHF (Figure 5a and b). The engineered repressors
were considerably more potent inhibitors of these AR
mutants than AR1-54 for all ligand conditions.

all significantly inhibited LNCaP growth within 3 days
(Figure 6b-d). At day 7, MAD7-35-AR1-54, KOX1-75-AR1-54
and PLZF1-452-AR1-54 inhibited LNCaP growth by 67, 57
and 55% respectively.
Colony formation assays were performed using the
more aggressive LNCaP-C42 prostate cancer cell line [38]
and the 2 shorter repressors (MAD7-35-AR1-54, KOX1-75AR1-54). Exogenous expression of MAD7-35-AR1-54 and
KOX1-75-AR1-54 significantly reduced colony formation,
with no colonies emerging in any experiment using the
latter construct (Figure 6E).

the 23FQNLF27 motif that mediates the N-/C-terminal
interaction [42]. The resulting PLZF1-452-AR1-54 repressor
was found to be more specific for the AR but did also
weakly inhibit the other steroid receptors. Previous studies
using phenylalanine-rich motifs have also found weak
cross-reactivity with these steroid receptors [21], hence
refinement of such motifs warrants further investigation.
Multiple mechanisms have been described to explain
therapy failure and CRPC, including alterations in AR
cofactor levels/localisation. Transcriptional competition
assays showed that, while the interaction motif alone was
unable to compete with the effects of increased SRC1
expression, all of the engineered repressors were able to
successfully inhibit AR activity under these conditions.
Mutation of the AR is another mechanism believed
to contribute to CRPC [35]. Identified mutations in
prostate cancer cluster in the LBD and several have been
demonstrated to reduce ligand specificity. For example,
the prostate cancer associated AR mutations H874Y and
T877A can be activated by non-androgenic hormones (e.g.
oestradiol and progesterone) and antiandrogens (e.g. CPA
and OHF) [11]. Importantly, the engineered repressors were
able to reduce the activity of these mutants irrespective of
the activating ligand, successfully blocking the receptors
when activated by both androgen and anti-androgens.
We have therefore demonstrated that fusion of
repression domains with an AR-specific interaction motif
generates potent inhibitors of the AR that are more potent
than interaction motifs alone, and that these constructs are
active in circumstances where conventional therapeutics
would be predicted to fail. Growth assays demonstrated
that these repressive effects upon the AR do translate to
growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells. Therefore, the
use of engineered repressors is a potential therapeutic
approach to inhibit CRPC, and methods to refine and
deliver such constructs, for example viral delivery or
nanoparticles, merit further investigation.

DISCUSSION
Hormone therapy targeting the AR pathway, is
a common therapeutic option for the treatment of PCa.
Although initially successful in the majority of patients,
such therapies invariably fail after a median of 2 years
and the tumours progress to the Castrate Resistant (CRPC)
stage. Few therapeutic options exist for this stage of the
disease, but much evidence exists to suggest that the AR
continues to drive CRPC growth, and hence remains a
valid therapeutic target [39].
Several groups have previously demonstrated
that peptides designed to bind to regions important in
AR activity (e.g. Activation Functions 1 and 2) can
successfully inhibit AR activity [20-23]. We reasoned
that fusing such peptides to repression domains derived
from transcriptional repressor proteins would yield more
potent inhibitors of AR activity. Therefore, we generated
engineered repressors consisting of an AR LBD interaction
motif (AR1-54), fused to known repression domains from a
number of potent transcriptional repressors, namely KOX,
MAD and PLZF [24-26]). These are uniquely designed to
interact with the AR when it is in an active conformation
and subsequently block transcriptional activity. Reporter
assays demonstrated that fusion of the repression domains
to the AR1-54 interaction motif generated potent repressors
of AR activity. Mutation of the interaction motif (FQNLF
to FQNAA) completely abolished repression, whereas
mutation of the MAD7-35 repression domain significantly
reduced, but did not abolish inhibitory potential, likely
as a result of the intact interaction motif since this alone
possesses some inhibitory activity ([40] and data herein).
Upon ligand binding, steroid receptors interact
with coactivators, which enhance transcriptional activity
[8]. Despite high homology between the LBDs of
steroid receptors, the AR is idiosyncratic in that it not
only interacts with α-helical LxxLL motifs present in
coactivators such as SRC1 but also interacts with, and
has preference for, similar phenylalanine rich motifs,
e.g. FxxLF motifs, found in the coactivator ARA70 and
in the N-terminus of the AR itself [41, 42]. To provide
AR selectivity of our repressors, we therefore utilised
an N-terminal fragment of the AR (AR1-54) containing

the repressors were PCR cloned into the KpnI and XbaI
sites. Site directed mutagenesis (QuickChange II, Agilent
DE, USA) was performed on the pSG5-MAD7-35AR1-54
construct to generate constructs with mutation of the
AR1-54 domain (FxxLF to FxxAA) or mutation of the

confirmed by diagnostic digest and sequencing. The
following plasmids have been previously described: pSG5SRC1e [43], pSVAR [44], TAT-GRE-EIB-LUC [45].

Cell Culture
COS1 and LNCaP cells were obtained from
ATCC and grown at 37°C 5% CO2. COS1 cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) and LNCaP/LNCaP-C42 cells in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium 1640 (Life
technologies, Strathclyde, UK), both supplemented with
2mM L-Glutamine, 100units/ml penicillin, 100mg/ml
streptomycin (PSG) and 10% foetal bovine serum. PC3WTAR cells [28] were grown as above with the addition
of 4μg/ml of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg,
MD). For experiments involving hormone manipulation,
cells were cultured in phenol red free DMEM or RPMI
supplemented with PSG and 5% charcoal stripped foetal
bovine serum (stripped medium).

Reporter Assays
COS1 cells were transfected using the calcium
phosphate method as previously described [11]. Cells
were seeded in 24 well plates and transfected per well
with steroid receptor expression plasmids (100 ng),
pDM-LACZ-β-GAL (100 ng), 1μg TAT-GRE-E1BLUC/ERE-LUC (1 µg) and 0-200ng of pSG5-AR1-54,

pSG5-MAD7-35-AR1-54(FQNAA)or pSG5-MAD7-35(L12P,
A16P)-AR1-54. PC3-WTAR cells were transfected with
50ng PDM-LACZ-β-GAL, 250ng TAT-GRE-E1B-LUC
and 0-200ng of pSG5-AR1-54, pSG5-MAD7-35-AR1-54,
KOX1-75-AR1-54, PLZF1-452-AR1-54 using FuGENE HD
(Promega, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells
were treated with 10nM of ligand and cells incubated
for a further 16 hrs. Luciferase and β-galactosidase
expression was measured as previously described [11].

Confocal Microscopy
COS1 cells were plated at 30% confluence on cover
slips in 24 well plates. Cells were transfected with pSVAR
and pGFP-MAD7-35AR1-54 using FuGENE 6 (Promega, WI,
USA) and incubated for 24hrs before treatment with ligand
for 2hrs. Wells were washed 3x with PBS and incubated
in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed 3x in PBS
and incubated for a further 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100
in PBS. Wells were again washed 3x with PBS, incubated
in blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS) for 30 min and a
further 1 hr with an AR antibody (AR C19, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, TX, USA) diluted 1:200 in blocking
solution. Wells were washed 3x with PBS, re-blocked
and incubated for 1hr with 594-Alexa Fluor conjugated
secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). A final 3x
PBS washes was performed before the coverslips were
mounted onto glass slides (Vectorshield containing DAPI,
DAKO, Cambridge, UK). Images were obtained using a
Zeiss Confocal Microscope, as previously described [46].

Growth Assays
LNCaP cells were plated to 50% confluence
in 6 well plates in ‘stripped media’ containing 10nM
Mibolerone and co-transfected with pGFP-Empty and
plasmids encoding AR1-54, MAD7-35-AR1-54, KOX1-75-AR1-54
or PLZF1-452-AR1-54 using JetPrime (VWR International
Ltd., Leicestershire, UK), following the manufacturers
instructions. 24hrs after transfection (set as day 0), GFP
positive cells were visualised in 10 random fields of
view from triplicate wells using an Axiovert Fluorescent
Microscope (Zeiss, x20 objective) and the number of GFP
positive cells assessed using Image J (NIH). Subsequent
cell counting was performed on days 3 and 7.

Immunoprecipitation

Colony Formation Assay

COS1 cells were seeded at 70% confluence in
10cm plates in ‘stripped medium’ and transfected with
plasmids encoding the AR and GFP-MAD7-35AR1-54
using FuGENE 6.0 (Promega, WI, USA). Cells were
left for 24hrs, treated for 2hrs ± 10nM Mibolerone and
lysed in IP buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50mM Tris

Colony formation assays were based on Kawano
et al. [47]. Briefly, LNCaP-C42 cells were plated in 6 well
plates and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid using JetPrime
(VWR International Ltd., Leicestershire, UK). Twentyfour hours after transfection, cells were trypsinised and
