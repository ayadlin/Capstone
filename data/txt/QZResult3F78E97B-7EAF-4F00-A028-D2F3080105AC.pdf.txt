ABSTRACT
Neoadjuvant platin-based therapy is accepted as a standard therapy for
advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Patients who respond have a better
survival prognosis, but still a significant number of responder patients die from
tumor recurrence. Molecular markers for prognosis in neoadjuvantly treated EAC
patients have not been identified yet. We investigated the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) in prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in these patients. Two
EAC patient cohorts, either treated by neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy
followed by surgery (n=86) or by surgical resection (n=46) were analyzed for EGFR
protein expression and gene copy number. Data were correlated with clinical and
histopathological response, disease-free and overall survival.
In case of EGFR overexpression, the prognosis for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
responders was poor as in non-responders. Responders had a significantly better
disease-free survival than non-responders only if EGFR expression level (p=0.0152)
or copy number (p=0.0050) was low. Comparing neoadjuvantly treated patients
and primary resection patients, tumors of non-responder patients more frequently
exhibited EGFR overexpression, providing evidence that EGFR is a factor for indicating
chemotherapy resistance.
EGFR overexpression and gene copy number are independent adverse prognostic
factors for neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated EAC patients, particularly for
responders. Furthermore, EGFR overexpression is involved in resistance to cisplatinbased neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

we examined the EGFR protein expression and gene copy
number changes, clinical characteristics, and outcome in
EAC patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. We hypothesized that EGFR in EAC
promotes an aggressive tumor phenotype and results in
poor outcomes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy resistance.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the
most rapidly increasing malignancies in the western
world [1-3]. Despite improvement in surgical outcomes,
the prognosis for EAC remains dismal with less than
20% of patients surviving 5 years [2]. Neoadjuvant
chemo- or radiochemotherapy followed by resection has
been shown to provide a survival benefit for patients
with locally advanced EAC compared to surgery alone
[4-7]. A common therapeutic approach for these EAC
is a multimodal treatment that includes preoperative
application of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II
(cisplatin) and 5-flurouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy,
followed by resection [4, 6-9]. Patients who respond to
the neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a better survival
[9-11]. Response evaluation for EAC treatment can be
performed according to metabolic response evaluation
using fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography,
clinical response evaluation by endoscopy, endoluminal
ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans, or
histopathological response evaluation following resection.
Until now, the histological response evaluation has been
considered the gold standard [12, 13], and these results are
strongly associated with survival [14-16]. It is generally
accepted that patients with a primary tumor response have
a significantly improved prognosis compared to patients
who do not respond [17]; however, despite a positive
histological response, a significant percentage of patients
still die due to tumor recurrence [16, 18, 19]. The reasons
for this remains unclear, and effective tools to predict
the clinical course of patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy are missing. The Union for International
Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer
(UICC/AJCC) TNM classification (7th edition) provides
a good prognostic stratification for primary resected
esophageal cancer, but the accuracy of this current
classification in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated EAC
remains largely unknown [13]. Therefore molecular
markers that may determine the prognosis in neoadjuvant
chemotherapy-treated EAC patients are urgently needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
pathway has been recognized as one of the key proliferative
pathways that is dysregulated during tumorigenesis, and
this pathway is a major regulator of various signaling
pathways involved in cell survival, migration, and tissue
regeneration [20]. In adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) and the distal esophagus, EGFR
expression has been found in approximately 30–60%
[21, 22], while EGFR gene amplification has been
found in 8–31% [23, 24]. Although an association of
EGFR expression or EGFR gene amplification with poor
prognosis in primary resection patients has been proposed
[21, 25], the clinical and biological significance of such
expression in neoadjuvantly treated patients remain
undefined. To further elucidate the role of EGFR in EAC,

RESULTS
Correlation of EGFR protein expression, copy
number changes, and clinical variables
Tissue samples of 86 patients who underwent
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 46 samples of patients
treated by primary resection without chemotherapy
were examined for EGFR protein expression and gene
copy number changes (EGFR-to-chromosome-7 ratio)
(Table 1). EGFR expression and copy number changes
were significantly positively correlated in neoadjuvant
chemotherapy-treated patients (p<0.0001) and primary
resection patients (p=0.0057). High EGFR protein
expression (IHC score 2+/3+) occurred in 31.4% of
patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In
contrast, only 13.0% of patients in the primary resection
group demonstrated high EGFR protein expression (Table
1). The number of patients with an EGFR gene copy
number amplification (EGFR-to-chromosome-7 ratio
of >2.2) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients
(4.7%) was comparable to that in the primary resection
patient group (4.3%; Table 1).

EGFR overexpression is an independent adverse
prognostic factor in EAC patients
EGFR protein expression was significantly
associated with outcome in the whole population including
neoadjuvant treated and primary resected patients (Figure
1, Table 2). In the neoadjuvant treated group, EGFR
protein expression was significantly associated with
disease-free survival (p=0.0194; Figure 1A, Table 2).
In primary resection patients, a significant association
between EGFR protein expression and disease-free
survival (p<0.0001; Figure 1G, Table 2) and overall
survival (p<0.0001; Figure 1H, Table 2) was identified.
Further stratification of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy
group into responding and non-responding patients
revealed that survival of patients who did not respond to
chemotherapy was not associated with EGFR expression
(Figure 1E-F, Table 2). In contrast, disease-free and
overall survival of responding patients were significantly
associated with the EGFR expression status (Figure 1C-D,
Table 2). Responding patients with low EGFR expression
profit significantly in terms of disease-free (p=0.0015;
Figure 1C, Table 2) and overall survival (p=0.0032; Figure

1D, Table 2), while high EGFR expression significantly
shortened survival in this subgroup (Figure 1C-D, Table
2).
Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed
EGFR overexpression as an independent adverse
prognostic factor for disease-free survival (p=0.0050;
HR=24.004; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 2.612–
220.622) and overall survival (p=0.0033; HR=13.466;
95% CI, 2.383–76.078) in patients who responded to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Table 3). This effect was also

observed in primary resection EAC patients with respect
to disease-free (p=0.0296; HR=1.994; 95% CI, 1.071–
3.716) and overall survival (p=0.0448; HR=1.899; 95%
CI, 1.015–3.555; Table 3).
Thus, EGFR protein expression is an independent
adverse prognostic factor, in particular, patients who
respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be stratified
into patients with a good survival prognosis with low
EGFR protein expression and patients with a poor survival
prognosis with high EGFR protein expression.

We further evaluated the influence of EGFR protein
expression in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients
as a molecular factor for survival prognosis. A statistically
significant association between low EGFR expression
levels (EGFR-low) and disease-free survival (p=0.0152)
and overall survival (p=0.0036) was noted in responders
and non-responders (Figure 2A), although responders
had a significantly better prognosis than non-responders.
In cases where patients did not respond to chemotherapy
but had low EGFR protein expression, after surviving the
first two years after therapy, their disease-free and overall

survival was as good as that for responder patients. In
contrast to these findings, in patients with high EGFR
expression, the prognosis for responders was as poor as
that for non-responders (Figure 2C). Thus, neoadjuvant
therapy responders with a putative good prognosis were
identified as actually having a poor prognosis after
neoadjuvant therapy according to EGFR overexpression.
We also evaluated these findings with regard to
copy number changes (EGFR-to-chromosome-7 ratio)
and obtained similar results. A statistically significant
difference was observed in responders and non-responders

between disease-free survival (p=0.0050) and overall
survival (p=0.0032) and patients who did not have an
EGFR amplification (Figure 2B), and a significantly
better prognosis was predicted for responders than for
non-responders. Identification of responder patients with
a poor prognosis as for EGFR-high patients was not
possible using FISH analysis in patients with an EGFRto-chromosome-7 ratio >2.2 due to limitations in patient
numbers (Figure 2D).

benefit [10, 11]; however, despite a positive histological
response, a significant number of patients die from tumor
recurrence [16, 18, 19]. Therapeutic response of patients
often do not prolong patient survival [26]. This might be
due to current therapies eliminate abundant cancer cells
but do not target stem cells [26]. In a review of concept,
Blagosklonny pointed out further explanations [27]. The
response-survival paradox could be explained as effective
therapy selects for resistance among proliferating cancer
cells [27]. Mechanisms of resistance might be either based
nononcogenic (e.g. drug transporters and mutation in
drug-targets) or oncogenic (e.g. apoptosis and cell cycle
dysregulation) [27]. The oncogenic resistance is associated
with highly aggressive cancer phenotype and, therefore no
survival benefit [27]. The above mentioned theories might
give an explanation for tumor recurrence in responding
EAC patients. In the current study, we investigated EGFR
in prognosis and chemotherapy resistance esophageal
adenocarcinoma patients with a positive response to
therapy but who died from tumor recurrence. EGFR, a
receptor tyrosine kinases, is a major regulator of signaling
pathways involved in cell survival, migration, and tissue
regeneration [20]. Several studies have demonstrated that
EGFR expression is a strong prognostic indicator that
correlates with both higher recurrence rates and shorter
survival in different tumor entities [21, 25, 28-30].
Additionally, studies on the EGFR status as a prognostic
factor in patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy
have been reported [31-33]. These studies have yielded
contradictory results across different cancer types [3133]. In a recently published study, EGFR overexpression
was useful in predicting response in patients with
triple-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy [33]. In an earlier study of triple-negative
breast cancer, patients with EGFR-positive had a less
favorable prognosis and a poorer response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy than patients with EGFR-negative tumors
[32]. On the other hand, in patients with locally advanced
rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy,
EGFR gene copy number was neither predictive nor
prognostic [31]. A few studies have investigated EGFR
expression in EAC patients, but these studies have focused
on prognosis in patients with primary resection of EAC or
AEG. Although in these studies EGFR was associated with
poor overall survival, a consistent association between
EGFR and an adverse outcome was not yet substantiated
[21, 25, 29, 30, 34]. The new finding in our study is, that
EGFR expression predicted poorer survival outcomes in
a subgroup of EAC patients with initial histopathologic
response to chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge,
this was not yet studied before in any other population.
In addition, in our study population of primary resection
patients, EGFR expression was a strong and independent
prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival. A
recently published study investigated factors that predict
prognosis and recurrence in patients with esophagogastric

Comparison of clinical, histopathological
response, and EGFR expression as factors for
prognosis
We examined EGFR protein expression with respect
to clinical and histopathological response evaluation as a
factor for prognosis in the neoadjuvant chemotherapytreated patient group. Multivariate COX regression
analysis revealed that EGFR protein expression was
the strongest prognostic factor for disease-free survival
(p=0.0218; HR=2.010; 95% CI, 1.107–3.650), while
histopathological response was the strongest factor for
overall survival (p=0.0018; HR=3.626; 95% CI, 1.613–
8.154).

Comparison of EGFR overexpression in
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary resection
EAC patients
The frequency of EGFR overexpression in
patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
compared with the frequency of EGFR overexpression
in EAC patients treated with primary resection without
chemotherapy. The percentage of cases with high EGFR
expression levels (score 2+ or 3+) was significantly more
often found (p=0.0108) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapytreated cohort (31.4%, 27 of 86 vs. 13.0%, 6 of 46)
compared to the primary resection cohort (Table 1). To
further assess these findings, we separately compared
the responder and the non-responder subgroup with the
primary resection cohort. No significant difference in the
frequency of EGFR overexpression was detected between
chemotherapy-responders and in primary resection
patients (p=0.2028; Figure 3A). In contrast, the frequency
of EGFR overexpression, was significantly higher in nonresponders than in primary resection patients (p=0.0107;
Figure 3B).

DISCUSSION
Neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is a
standard treatment regimen for patients with advanced
EAC [4, 7]. It is generally accepted that patients who
respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a survival

adenocarcinoma and a histopathological response with
less than 10% residual tumor [18]. Response of the
primary tumor did not ensure recurrence-free long-term
survival, although complete histopathological responders
had a better prognosis compared to partial responders [18].
Another recently published study defined a multifactorial
histopathological score based on ypT category, ypN, and
degree of histological tumor regression for the prediction
of prognosis of resected EAC after cisplatin-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [35]. Our data, however,
demonstrated that EGFR expression or copy number
changes are strong and independent molecular prognostic
factors for disease-free and overall survival in patients
with EAC who responded to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
but had an unfavorable diagnosis.
Cisplatin is a DNA-damaging anti-tumor agent
that activates nuclear as well as cytoplasmic signaling
pathways involved in regulation of the cell cycle,
damage repair, and programmed cell death [36]. EGFR
expression may be involved in resistance to cisplatin [37,
38]. The signals generated by DNA damage caused by
cisplatin treatment modulate EGFR activity in EGFRexpressing cells and suppress cell death by upregulating
antiapoptotic proteins [37]. In addition, inhibition
of EGFR activation enhances cisplatin-induced cell
death [37]. Overexpression of EGFR and inhibition
of proliferation has been observed in cisplatin-treated
ovarian carcinoma cells, and these molecular changes
were hypothesized to be an escape mechanism of tumor
cells [39]. Another study demonstrated that treatment
of chemosensitive neuroblastoma cells with cisplatin

reversibly increased EGFR expression and that cisplatinresistant cells exhibited enhanced EGFR expression
dependent of the presence of cisplatin [40]. In squamous
cell carcinoma cells, increased EGF signaling and
subsequent increased interleukin (IL)-1ß contributed to
chemotherapeutic resistance [41]. Furthermore, acquired
cisplatin resistance in EGFR-expressing lung cancer cells
did not affect the sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [42]. Together, these studies demonstrate that
EGFR may be involved in mechanism of resistance
to cisplatin. In the present study, we compared the
frequency of EGFR overexpression in primary resection
patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy responders
and non-responders. In the non-responding subgroup,
EGFR expression was significantly higher than that
in chemotherapy responders as well as in the primary
resection patients. These findings provide evidence
that EGFR overexpression is a factor for chemotherapy
resistance and supports the hypothesis that EGFR is
involved in the mechanism of resistance against cisplatinbased neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Resistance can be exploited for therapeutic
advantage [43, 44]. Evolving from several decades of
systematic research in cancer cell biology, several EGFR
inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine
kinase inhibitors have been developed and implemented
in clinical application [45]. The efficacy of cetuximab in
combination with chemotherapy was evaluated as a firstline treatment of advanced gastric and gastro-esophageal
junction cancer [46-49]. The overall results of these
studies revealed response rates between 41 and 65%.

Figure 3: Bar graphs depict EGFR expression level distribution (EGFR-high vs. EGFR-low) in comparisons of primary
resection patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (A) responders and (B) non-responders. EGFR overexpression is more frequent in nonresponding patients, and thus, this overexpression can be interpreted as a factor for chemotherapy resistance.

Response evaluation and follow-up

The efficacy of cetuximab plus capecitabin and cisplatin
was subsequently tested in a multinational randomized
phase III trial for the first-line treatment of patients
with advanced gastric and gastro-esophageal junction
cancer (EXPAND, NCT00678535) [50]. The addition of
cetuximab to capecitabine-cisplatin provided no additional
benefit to chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment
of advanced gastric or gastro-esophageal junction cancer;
however, this study did not specifically focus on AEG 1
patients. Therefore, studies on the effect of EGFR-directed
therapy in AEG 1 patients have been missing but may
be of interest in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting
especially for EGFR-positive patients.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that EGFR
overexpression and gene copy number changes are
independent adverse prognostic factors in EAC patients
and may be useful molecular markers for outcome
prediction in patients who receive neoadjuvant platinbased chemotherapy.

Tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
characterized clinically and histopathologically.
Clinical response was evaluated by endoscopy
with endoluminal ultrasound and CT scan after the first
and second cycle as described previously [54]. Response
was defined as at least 50% reduction in the size of the
primary tumor, as measured by endoscopy and imaging
studies [55].
Histopathological tumor regression was assessed
according to a recently published scoring system [56].
For the purposes of this study, all patients with fewer
than 10% residual tumor cells (regression score 1) were
classified as responders. All other patients were classified
as histopathological non-responders.
Patient follow-up included endoscopy and CT of
the chest and abdomen at 3-month intervals during the
first year after surgery and thereafter at 6-month intervals.
Overall survival and disease-free survival were calculated
from the day of surgery. Survival analyses for the primary
resection cohort were calculated from all 46 patients with
a median follow-up of 19.9 months (range, 0.1 to 134.0
months) for overall survival and 14.5 months (range,
0.1 to 134.0 months) for disease-free survival. For the
neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated cohort, median followup was 17.0 months for overall survival (range, 0.8 to
110.4 months) and 9.2 months for disease-free survival
(range, 0.1 to 79.8 months). The observation time was the
interval between diagnosis and last contact (death or last
follow-up).

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
In this study, a total of 132 patients with EAC
(all classified as type I according to Siewert [51]) were
included. The patients were staged as cT3 or cT4 based
on endoscopic ultrasonography and CT of the chest and
abdomen. The study population consisted of two different
treatment groups: one was treated with cisplatin-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the second was treated
by primary resection without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
All patients provided written informed consent, and
patient data were acquired with approval from the ethics
committee of the Technische Universität München,
Germany. For all patients, surgical resection material
(formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue) was available.

Tissue microarrays
Three representative areas of the tumor (1.0
mm diameter) were removed from paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks, which had been prepared at the time of
resection, using a tissue microarray instrument (Beecher
Instruments, Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA). Serial sections
were cut for the purpose of immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and transferred to adhesive slides using the “paraffin-tapetransfer-system” according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Instrumedics, Hackensack, NJ, USA).

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort
Patients (n=86) were treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of cisplatin on days
1, 15, and 29 and folinic acid plus fluorouracil on days 1,
8, 15, 22, 29, and 36, all repeated on day 49, as previously
described in detail [52].

samples. Signal evaluation was performed by visual
counting using an epifluorescence microscope equipped
with a C-Apochromat 63x/NA 1.2 W objective and an
AxioCam b/w charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss
Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH; AxioVision
software release 4.5) according to standard procedures.
At least 50 tumor cells per case were selected randomly,
whereas only cells with a minimum of one signal for
EGFR gene and centromere-7 were chosen, and the mean
was calculated. FISH scoring for EGFR-to-chromosome-7
ratio was applied, and two categories were determined:
mean ratios of ≤2.2 and >2.2. Ratios ≤2.2 were designated
as non-amplified, while ratios >2.2 were designated as
EGFR amplification.

EGFR immunohistochemistry was performed
using the Dako EGFRpharmDxTM assay detection system
(Dako Diagnostika GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) as
described previously [58]. Tumors were considered to be
negative when no staining or membrane staining in <10%
neoplastic cells was observed. Weak complete and/or
incomplete membrane staining in >10% neoplastic cells
was considered as 1+ positive, while moderate complete
and/or incomplete membrane staining in >10% neoplastic
cells was considered as 2+ positive. Strong complete and/
or incomplete membrane staining in >10% neoplastic cells
was considered as 3+ positive. Cases with a score of 0
or 1+ were considered as EGFR-low expression cases,
while those with a score of 2+ or 3+ were considered
overexpression (EGFR-high) cases.

Correlations between variables were calculated
using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Frequency tables
were tested by χ2 test or Fisher exact test for comparison
of discrete variables. Stepwise Cox regression analysis
was applied to select parameters for predicting the overall
survival time or disease-free survival time, their calculated
hazard ratio are listed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
for different strata were plotted for overall survival and
disease-free survival. The differences were tested by the
log-rank test. All statistical tests were performed with SAS
statistical package version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC), and significance was determined at the 95% level.
