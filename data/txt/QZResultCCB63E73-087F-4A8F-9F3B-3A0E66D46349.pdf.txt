ABSTRACT
Afatinib has anti-tumor effect in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. We found afatinib can also induce
apoptosis in NSCLC cells without EGFR mutation through CIP2A pathway. Four NSCLC
cell lines (H358 H441 H460 and A549) were treated with afatinib to determine
their sensitivity to afatinib-induced cell death and apoptosis. The effects of CIP2A
on afatinib-induced apoptosis were confirmed by overexpression and knockdown
of CIP2A expression in the sensitive and resistant cells, respectively. Reduction of
Elk-1 binding to the CIP2A promoter and suppression of CIP2A transcription were
analyzed. In vivo efficacy of afatinib against H358 and H460 xenografts tumors were
also determined in nude mice. Afatinib induced significant cell death and apoptosis
in H358 and H441 cells, but not in H460 or A549 cells. The apoptotic effect of afatinib
in sensitive cells was associated with downregulation of CIP2A, promotion of PP2A
activity and decrease in AKT phosphorylation. Afatinib suppressed CIP2A at the gene
transcription level by reducing the promoter binding activity of Elk-1. Clinical samples
showed that higher CIP2A expression predicted a poor prognosis and Elk-1 and CIP2A
expressions were highly correlated. In conclusion, afatinib induces apoptosis in NSCLC
without EGFR mutations through Elk-1/CIP2A/PP2A/AKT pathway.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide [1]. It is broadly classiﬁed into two
major categories: small cell lung cancer and non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 80% of lung cancers are
NSCLC [1]. Platinum-based chemotherapy is currently
the standard treatment for NSCLC [2-4], but targeted
therapies with few side effects may compensate for the
incompleteness of conventional chemotherapy. Epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been
reported in 10-15% of Caucasian patients with NSCLC,
and in an even higher percentage of Asian patients [5].
NSCLC patients with certain EGFR mutations such as
L858R and exon 19 deletion have been reported to have a
higher response rate to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) than those without EGFR-activating mutations
[6-9]. However, some NSCLC patients without EGFR
mutation still respond to TKIs [6-11], which suggesting
that there may be mechanism(s) other than the EGFR
pathway by which TKIs can cause apoptosis in NSCLC
cells without EGFR mutation. Elucidating this mechanism
may offer a new therapeutic option for NSCLC patients
without EGFR mutation.
Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A
(CIP2A) was originally identified as a cellular PP2A
inhibitor that inhibits the proteolytic degradation
of c-MYC [12, 13]. CIP2A has been found to be
overexpressed in several human malignancies including
hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, head and neck
cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and
NSCLC [12-21]. In addition, CIP2A is overexpressed in
NSCLC and correlated with a poor prognosis [12, 15, 18,
21], and the downregulation of CIP2A and inactivation of
the AKT pathway has been reported to inhibit proliferation
and induce apoptosis in a variety of lung cancer cells [12,
18].
Afatinib is new generation TKI, and is an
irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of
members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family
(ErbB) including EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4 [12, 18, 22, 23].
Afatinib covalently binds to cysteine 797 of EGFR and
cysteines 805 and 803 in HER2 and ErbB4, respectively.
Such covalent binding irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine
kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in reduced
auto- and trans-phosphorylation within the ErbB dimers
and inhibition of important steps in the signal transduction
of all ErbB receptor family members. Afatinib has antitumor effect in NSCLC with EGFR mutations [24-26].
Afatinib has anti-tumor effect in NSCLC with activating
EGFR mutations, approved by EU, US FDA and Taiwan
FDA [22-27]. However, we found afatinib also induced
apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines without EGFR mutation.
The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanistic
basis for the effect of afatinib in NSCLC without EGFR
mutations.

Differential effects of afatinib on cellular
apoptosis in the NSCLC cell lines
To examine the antitumor effects of afatinib on the
NSCLC cell lines without EGFR mutation, we conducted
FACS analysis by flow cytometry using propidium iodide
(PI) to analyze the sub-G1 percentage. As shown in Figure
1A, afatinib exhibited differential apoptotic effects on
the NSCLC cell lines. The H358 and H441 cells showed
significant apoptotic effects in the presence of afatinib in
a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, the H460
and A549 cells were less sensitive to afatinib-induced
apoptosis. In addition, the apoptotic effects were further
evaluated by DNA fragmentation assay, determination of
caspase-3 activity, and Western blot analysis of cleaved
PARP. In the H358 and H441 cells, we found that the cells
exposed to afatinib had increased DNA fragmentation
(Figure1B), cleaved PARP (Figure1C) and caspase-3
activity (Figure1D) but not in the H460 and A549 cells.
These results indicate that afatinib induces apoptosis in
H358 and H441 cells.

Downregulation of CIP2A determined afatinib–
induced apoptosis through p-AKT inhibition in
the NSCLC cell lines
According to the differential effects of afatinib
on apoptosis (Figure1), we defined the H358 and H441
as afatininb-sensitive cell lines, and H460 and A549
as afatininb-resistant cell lines. We next investigated
the role of CIP2A in afatinib-induced apoptosis in the
NSCLC cells. As shown in Figure 2A, afatinib decreased
CIP2A protein levels and AKT phosphorylation in the
afatinib-sensitive H358 and H441 cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Figure 2C). In contrast, afatinib
did not significantly decrease CIP2A protein levels or
AKT phosphorylation in the resistant H460 and A549
cells. These results indicated that the CIP2A signaling
pathway may play an important role in determining the
sensitivity of lung cancer cells to afatinib. Previous studies
demonstrated that CIP2A is an oncogenic PP2A inhibitor
protein that is highly expression in malignant cancers.
We found that the PP2A activity increased (Figure 2B)
when protein level of CIP2A decreased (Figure 2A) in
the sensitive H358 and H441 cells, whereas, afatinib did
not change PP2A activity (Figure. 2B) or protein level
of CIP2A (Figure 2A) in the resistant H460 and A549
cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the CIP2APP2A-AKT pathway may mediate the sensitizing effect
of afatinib.

Afatinib enhanced the NSCLC cells apoptosis
and cell death through the mechanism of CIP2APP2A-AKT

the sensitive H358 cells (Figure 4B). However, afatinib
did not alter the luciferase activity in the resistant H460
cells. Among the various lengths of CIP2A promoter
regions (-1~ -62 bp, -1~ -150 bp, -1~ -300 bp, -1~ -400
bp, -1~ -1000 bp and -1~ -2000 bp), we observed that
each length of the promoters was significantly depressed
by increasing the dose of afatinib except for -1~ -62
bp. The putative Elk-1-binding site existed in the -62~
-150 bp element. We therefore performed ChIP assay to
evaluate the binding affinity between the transcription
factor of Elk-1 and CIP2A promoter. The interaction of
Elk-1 with the CIP2A promoter was abolished in a dosedependent manner in the sensitive H358 cells but not in
the resistant H460 cells (Figure 4C). Furthermore, we
explored the effect of afatinib on transcription factor of
Elk-1, and found that both mRNA (Figure 4D) and protein
levels (Figure 4E) of Elk-1 were reduced by afatinib.
Moreover, the ectopic expression of Elk-1 also restored
CIP2A expression (Figure 4E, left) and partially protected
the cells from apoptotic death induced by afatinib in H358
cells (Figure 4E, right). On the other hand, deprivation of
Elk-1 increased apoptosis by afatinib in H460 cells (Figure
4F). These results suggest that afatinib may inhibit CIP2A
expression by affecting the DNA binding ability of Elk-1
via debasing Elk-1 in the sensitive H358 cells.

To verify the role of CIP2A/PP2A/p-AKT in
mediating afatinib-induced apoptosis in the EGFR wildtype sensitive NSCLC cells, two approaches were used.
First, the ectopic expression of CIP2A was evaluated in
the sensitive H358 cells (Figure 3A, left), which showed
that CIP2A was overexpression and partially protected the
cells from apoptotic cell death induced by afatinib, and
that PP2A activity was decreased (Figure 3B, left). Further,
knockdown of the gene expression of CIP2A increased the
sensitivity of afatinib-induced apoptosis in the resistant
H460 cells (Figure 3A, right) and increased PP2A activity
(Figure 3B, right). This suggested that afatinib may repress
CIP2A, enhance PP2A activity, and then induce cell death.
Furthermore, in order to examine the relationship between
PP2A and AKT (Figure 3C), we knocked down PP2Ac
expression by siRNA strategy in the sensitive H358 cells.
The results showed that AKT phosphorylation increased
with the deprived of PP2A and also partially protected
the cells from apoptotic death induced by afatinib. In
addition, with the treatment of okadaic acid, a known
PP2A inhibitor, AKT phosphorylation was significantly
increased in the sensitive H358 cells which reduced the
afatinib-induced apoptosis (Figure 3D, left), whereas cotreatment with forskolin sensitized resistant H460 cells to
afatinib-induced apoptosis and p-AKT downregulation
(Figure 3D, right) . We next analyzed the role of AKT,
which is downstream of PP2A, in mediating the effects of
afatinib. The ectopic expression of AKT in the sensitive
H358 cells (Figure 3E) partially protected the cells from
apoptotic death. Taken together, these results suggest
that the afatinib-induced apoptotic effect is through the
CIP2A-PP2A-AKT pathway in NSCLC cells.

Evaluation of the therapeutic effect of afatinib on
H358-bearing mice
To determine whether or not the in vitro effects
of afatinib on the sensitive H358 cells and the resistant
H460 cells could be reproduced in vivo, mice were
implanted with H358 and H460 xenografts. No apparent
differences in body weight or toxicity were found (Figure
5A). Treatment with afatinib significantly inhibited H358
xenografts tumor growth by nearly 80% compared to the
controls (Figure 5A-a, left), but not in the H460 xenografts
(Figure 5A-b left). To correlate the clinical implications
in NSCLC with the mechanism identified in vitro, the
effects of afatinib on the CIP2A-PP2A-AKT pathway in
these tumor were examined by Western blot and PP2A
activity assay. Overall, there were significant decreases
in CIP2A, p-AKT and Elk-1(Figure 5B) and an enhanced
PP2A activity (Figure 5C) in the H358 tumors treated
with afatinib (Figure 5B, 5C left), whereas no significant
changes were observed in the control (vehicle) or H460
tumors (Figure 5B, 5C right). Immunohistochemical
analysis of the tumor specimens demonstrated strong
cytoplasmic staining of CIP2A and p-AKT in the vehicles
of H358 and H460 cells (Figure 5D). This staining
revealed weaker expression under afatinib treatment in the
H358 cells (Figure 5D left), but not in the afatinib-resistant
H460 cells (Figure 5D right). Taken together, these results
confirmed that afatinib increased PP2A activity to repress
p-AKT via CIP2A to inhibit tumor growth in this NSCLC

Afatinib reduced Elk-1 binding to the CIP2A
promoter and suppressed CIP2A transcription
To examine the mechanism by which afatinib
inhibits CIP2A expression, we investigated whether
afatinib affected CIP2A protein degradation. After protein
translation was blocked by cycloheximide, the rate of
CIP2A degradation did not change significantly with
or without afatinib in H358 cells (Figure 4A, left). We
next investigated whether afatinib affected CIP2A gene
transcription. These results showed that the mRNA levels
of CIP2A decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner
in the sensitive H358 cells but not in the resistant H460
cells (Figure 4A, right). To further explore the inhibition
of CIP2A transcription by afatinib, the sensitive H358
cells were transfected with CIP2A promoter luciferase
constructs. Afatinib signiﬁcantly down-regulated the
CIP2A promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in

observed in the clinical tumor samples from the NSCLC
patients and that the expression of CIP2A in the tumor
samples was correlated with the expressions of p-AKT and
Elk-1 (Figure 6A). Higher CIP2A and Elk-1 expressions
were found in the tumor part compared to the non-tumor
part (Figure 6B), and the expressions of CIP2A and Elk1 were highly correlated (r=0.733, p<0.001) (Figure 6C).
The progression-free survival of the patients with a high
CIP2A expression was shorter than for those with a low

the overexpression of CIP2A upregulated p-AKT and

NSCLC and is correlated with a poor prognosis [15, 18,
21]and TNM stage [21]. This strengthens the evidence
that CIP2A may be a potential drug target [13, 18, 28-37].
Ma et al. demonstrated that Rabdocoetsin B can inhibit
proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety of lung
cancer cells by down-regulating CIP2A and inactivating
AKT pathway [18]. Our in vivo results also showed that
afatinib downregulated CIP2A through Elk-1 in H358
xenograft tumors and inhibited tumor growth (Figure 5).
These structurally unrelated agents showed a common
target in different cancer cells, suggesting that CIP2A may
be a novel anti-cancer target.
Elk-1 is a member of the ETS oncogene family.
They are transcription factors involved in many
biological processes, including cell growth and survival,
angiogenesis, wound healing and cancer [18, 38]. The
ETS transcription factor family is defined by the presence
of a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, and the
proto-oncogene c-fos characterized as an Elk-1 target
[39]. Promoter activity is regulated by the serum response
element (SRE), and recruitment of Elk-1 to the SRE is
through the combination of protein-protein or proteinDNA interactions [40]. Pallai et al. demonstrated that
the binding of Ets-1 and Elk-1 together to the proximal
CIP2A promoter is required for CIP2A expression in
cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cell lines
[41]. However, another study showed that only Ets-1 is
required to regulate CIP2A expression in prostate and
gastric carcinoma [42]. Our ChIP experiments using an
Elk-1 specific antibody revealed that afatinib reduced
CIP2A promoter occupancy by Elk-1 in a dose-dependent
manner in sensitive H358 cells but not in resistant H460
cells (Figure 4C). Afatinib did not change the CIP2A
promoter occupancy by Ets-1 (data not shown). Thus,
in NSCLC treated with afatinib, Elk-1 mediates CIP2A
expressed reduction causing of interfered with the function
of Elk-1. Addition, the Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling
cascades activated downstream transcription factor Elk-1
has been proved which involved in Elk-1-regulated EMT
[43]. In order to verify how Elk-1 is modulated, we have
additionally performed experiments with knockdown of
ErbB family or KRAS (Supplement Figure S1). There are
no apparently alterations of Elk-1 under HER2 siRNA,
Erb4 siRNA, KRAS siRNA, or EGFR siRNA. Therefore,
afatinib may modulate Elk-1 not through ErbB family
or KRAS. Furthermore, we have additionally performed
experiments to see the change of CIP2A after adding
afatinib under different EGFR status (Supplement Figure
S2). In H358 (EGFR wild) and PC9 (EGFR mutation),
we tested the effect of afatinib or EGFR siRNA. Under
EGFR siRNA only (without afatinib), EGFR decreased
but CIP2A did not show any change. Adding afatinib and
EGFR siRNA together, CIP2A decreased. Therefore the
decrement of CIP2A may be not through EGFR, no matter
in EGFR wild or EGFR mutation NSCLC cell lines.
Clinical trials for afatinib, such as LUX-Lung 3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[26] and LUX-Lung 6 [25], have focused on NSCLC
patients harboring EGFR mutations. However, NSCLC
patients without EGFR mutation are still a big population
in NSCLC [44]. Current, there is a phase II study of
afatinib as third-line treatment for patients in Korea
with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer harboring
wild-type EGFR [45]. In this trial, 42 patients received
afatinib treatment but then 38 of those were included in
efficacy analyses (other 4 patients were tested positive for
EGFR mutations later). No complete response or partial
responses were found and disease control rate was 24%
with median disease control duration of 19.3 weeks. In
addition, several studies on other TKIs have shown effects
in NSCLC patients without EGFR mutation. In the phase
3 Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable NSCLC (SATURN)
trial, erlotinib was used as a second-line NSCLC
maintenance therapy and showed a better progressionfree survival than placebo in the patients without EGFR
mutation (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.63–0.96; p= 0.0185)
[10]. In the Tarceva In Treatment of Advanced NSCLC
(TITAN) study, there was no significant difference in
the patients treated with second-line erlotinib and those
treated with docetaxel or pemetrexed in the subgroup
without EGFR mutation (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.59–
1.22; p= 0.37) [11]. Therefore, afatinib may be effective in
patients without EGFR mutation. Our results demonstrate
a possible mechanism and suggest a potential biomarker
for the selection of suitable NSCLC patients for future
afatinib trials.
Besides, afatinib may also effective in patients
with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. In the
animal study, the combine use of afatinib and cetuximab,
the EGFR-specific antibody, can dramatic shrinkage of
erlotinib-resistant tumors harboring the T790M mutation
[46], There are also the clinical trials in the combination
of afatinib and cetuximab for EGFR-mutant lung cancers
with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, both
with and without T790M mutations. Among 126 patients,
objective response rate (overall 29%) was comparable
in T790M-positive and T790M-negative tumors (32%
vs. 25%; P= 0.341). Median progression-free survival
was 4.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.3–6.4);
median duration of confirmed objective response was
5.7 months (range, 1.8–24.4)[47]. There may be other
pathways besides dual inhibition of EGFR. Our results
may offer other mechanism to explain the possibility of
combinations of afatinib and cetuximab.
In conclusion, afatinib induced apoptosis in
NSCLC cell lines without EGFR mutation through
a novel mechanism, the Elk-1/CIP2A/PP2A/p-AKT
pathway. CIP2A was a major molecular determinant of
the sensitivity of NSCLC without EGFR mutation to
afatinib-induced apoptosis. Focusing on the interactions
of oncoproteins, phosphatases and kinases could be a
novel anti-cancer strategy. Future studies to elucidate the
mechanism by which afatinib inhibits Elk-1 may lead to

HRP, anti-mouse/rabbit, DakoCytomation). Tissue
staining was visualized using DAB substrate chromogen
solution (DakoCytomation). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Each
run included using phosphate buffered solution as the
primary antibody for the negative control, and the samples
known to express these markers strongly served as the
positive control. Two experienced pathologists reviewed
the immunohistochemical slides, and immunostaining
intensity results were recorded as 0 for no staining, 1
for faint, 2 for moderate, and 3 for intense staining. The
percentage of staining of each core was also recorded from
0% to 100%. The H-score (from 0 to 300) was calculated
by multiplying the staining intensity and percentage of
each core. The immunostaining results were classified as
negative for an H-score of 100 or less, and positive for an
H-score of more than 100.

METHODS
Patient samples collection
The Institutional Review Board of Cardinal Tien
Hospital (CTH) approved the study protocol. Tumor
specimens from 49 patients who underwent surgical
resection for primary NSCLC at CTH between 2004
and 2009 were examined. All clinical charts and
histopathology reports were reviewed for data on age,
gender, site, diagnosis, differentiation, tumor size, lymph
node or distant metastasis, and TMN staging. All patients
were followed with the disease status of disease free or
disease progression. At the end of current study, survival
status of each subjects were also recorded.
All tissue samples were routinely fixed in formalin
and embedded in paraffin wax. Representative tissue areas
were chosen at the junction of the major tumor mass and
the adjacent benign area marked on standard hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) sections taken from the paraffin block
using a 2.0-mm punch, and inserted into a recipient
paraffin block. Four-μm-thick sections were cut from the
completed array block and transferred to silanized glass
slides.

Cell culture
Four NSCLC cell lines were used in this study.
H358 (bronchioloalveolar carcinoma [BAC], mutant
KRAS), H441 (papillary adenocarcinoma, mutant KRAS,
and TP53), and A549 (BAC, mutant KRAS, CDKN2A,
and STK11) cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and the
H460 (large cell lung cancer, mutant KRAS, PIK3CA,
STK11, and CDKN2A) cell line was obtained from the
Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu,
Taiwan). The NSCLC cell lines were kept in RPMI1640
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Saint Aubin, France)
supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBO/Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY), 100 units/mL penicillin G and 100 µg/
mL streptomycin sulfate in a 37°C humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 in air.

Histology, immunohistochemistry and scoring
The constructed tissue array paraffin embedded
blocks were cut into 5-μm-thick sections for H&E staining.
For each case, carcinoma type, cell differentiation, growth
pattern, tumor cell nuclear morphology, metaplasia,
calcification, necrosis, mitosis count, invasion status and
other specific differentiations were re-checked by two
pathologists. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was
performed using a Ventana BenchMark XT automated
stainer (Ventana, Tucson, AZ). Briefly, 4-μm-thick
sections were cut consecutively from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue. These sections were then
mounted on silanized slides and allowed to dry overnight
at 37°C. After deparaffinization and rehydratation, the
slides were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution
for 5 minutes. After washing with the supplied buffer,
the tissue sections were repaired for 40 minutes with
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid.
The slides were then incubated with the primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C, including, anti-pAKT1(Ser473) (1:50, Genetex, Irvine, CA), anti-CIP2A
(1:50, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-Elk-1 (1:25,
Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA). After three rinses in buffer
solution, the slides were then incubated with the secondary
antibodies (unbiotinylated antibody, EnVisionTM System,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Reagents and antibodies
Afatinib (Giotrif®) was purchased from Selleck
chemicals (Houston, TX). For in vitro studies, afatinib at
various concentrations was dissolved in DMSO and then
added to cells in serum-free RPMI1640. PP2A inhibitor
and activator were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, Missouri) and Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA),
respectively. Antibodies for immunoblotting including
anti-CIP2A, AKT, Elk-1 and PARP were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Other
antibodies including anti-PP2A and p-AKT (Ser473) were
purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA).

Apoptosis analysis and caspase-3 activity assay
Apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometry
(sub-G1 analysis) and drug-induced apoptotic cell

Oncotarget

death was detected by Western blot analysis of PARP
cleavage. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation was measured
using a Cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA kit (Roche,
Diagnostics Corp, Indy) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The activity of caspase-3 was determined
using a caspase-3 assay kit (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA),
which detected the cleavage of chromogenic caspase-3
substrates (Ac-DEVD-pNA). Protein was extracted using
ice-cold cell lysis buffer, and total protein (1–3 mg/ml) was
added to the reaction buffer containing 10 ul Ac-DEVDpNA (2 mM), followed by incubation for 60–120 minutes
at 37°C. The free pNA cleaved from its precursor was
quantified using a spectrometer at 405 nm. A comparison
of the absorbance of pNA from an apoptotic sample with
an un-induced control allowed for the determination of the
fold increase in caspase-3 activity.

6-well plates with Dharma-FECT4 transfection reagent
(Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). After 48 hours, the medium
was replaced and the cancer cells were harvested for
analysis by Western blot and flow cytometry to measure
apoptosis.

Quantification of CIP2A and Elk-1 gene
expressions

CIP2A cDNA (KIAA1524), AKT1 cDNA and Elk1 cDNA were purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD).
Briefly, following transfection, H358 cells were incubated
in the presence of G418 (0.78 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich;
St. Louis, MO). After 8 weeks of selection, surviving
colonies, i.e., those arising from stably transfected cells
were selected and individually amplified. The H358 cells
that were transient transfected with Elk-1, CIP2A or AKT1
were then treated with afatinib, harvested, and processed
for Western blot analysis. Transfection was carried out the
X-tremeGENE HP Transfection Reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Diagnostics Corp,
IN).

Total RNA was extracted from H358 and H460 cells
(approximately 5 × 106) followed by afatinib treatment
using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD),
and then reverse transcribed using a QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD). The real
time quantitative PCR was performed on an Applied
Roter-Gene 3000 detector (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD)
with a specific primer set for each target gene and SYBR
Green dye (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR primer sets for
the target genes were as follows: human CIP2A (Hs_
KIAA1524 QuantiTect Primer Assay (NM_020890)),
human Elk-1 (Hs_Elk-1 QuantiTect Primer Assay
(NM_005229)) and human actin (Hs_ACTB QuantiTect
Primer Assay (NM_001101)). An aliquot of each sample
was analyzed by quantitative PCR for actin to normalize
for inefficiencies in cDNA synthesis and the amount of
RNA input. For each sample, the average threshold (Ct)
value was determined from quadruplicate assays, and
the ΔCt value was determined by subtracting the average
actin Ct value from the average CIP2A Ct value. Three
independent experiments were performed to measure the
levels of CIP2A and Elk-1 of H358 and H460 cells with
different durations of treatment.

PP2A phosphatase Activity

Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity was
measured in fresh cells as described previously using
an R&D Systems PP2A DuoSet IC activity assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, an immobilized
capture antibody specific for the catalytic subunit of PP2A
that binds both active and inactive PP2A was used. After
washing, a substrate was added that is dephosphorylated
by active PP2A to generate free phosphate, which is then
detected by a sensitive dye-binding assay using malachite
green and molybdic acid.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed
using 1-2 x 107 H358 or H460 cells. The cells were
treated with DMSO or afatinib for 24 hours. After afatinib
treatment, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde
to crosslink for 10 min at room temperature, by adding
1X glycine to stop crosslink. Then cells were then washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped in ice-cold PBS
containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Diagnostics Corp,
IN). The cells were then collected and washed twice with
PBS followed by centrifugation at 700xg for 5 minutes at
4°C. The cell pellets were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer
with protease inhibitors, and chromatin was sheared via
sonication on a cup horn for 6 minutes with 30-second
bursts to yield an average DNA fragment length of
approximately 100-1000 base pairs. Lysates were clarified
by centrifugation at 12,500xg for 5 minutes at 4°C, diluted
1:5 with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dilution
buffer (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO), and
incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies:

To verify the transcriptional activity between the
erlotinib-sensitive (H358) and erlotinib-resistant (H460)
cells, the promoter activity of CIP2A was determined using
a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison,
WI). The H358 and H460 cells were co-transfected in
6-well plates with 2 µg of DNA, including the luciferase
reporter construct pGL4.17-CIP2A-promoter, and pRLTK vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) as an indicator for
the normalization of transfection efficiency, at a ratio of
9:1. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, various doses
of afatinib were added. After twenty-four hours, the
cells lysates were collected and luciferase activity was
quantified according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega, Madison, WI). Cells co-transfected with
pGL4.17-basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI)
combined with the pRL-TK plasmid were used as a
negative control. The promoter activity was repeated three
times in parallel for statistical analysis.
