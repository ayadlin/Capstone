Abstract
The prognosis of follicular lymphoma (FL) patients is suspected to be inﬂuenced by tumor-inﬁltrating regulatory T cells
(Treg). The mechanism of Treg enrichment in FL and their impact
on malignant FL B cells remains to be elucidated. We analyzed
46 fresh lymph node biopsy samples, including FL (n ¼ 20),
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n ¼ 10), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (n ¼ 9), and reactive lymphadenitis (n ¼ 7). Using
multicolor ﬂow cytometry and cell sorting, we observed an
accumulation of CD25highCD127low/neg Tregs in FL tissues. These
Tregs comprised activated ICOSþ Tregs that were able to suppress

not only conventional T cells, but also FL B cells. These FL B
cells were able to express ICOSL in vitro and to generate
CD25highFoxP3high Tregs expressing ICOS. Treg generation was
associated with ICOS/ICOSL engagement and was abrogated by
antagonist anti-ICOS and anti-ICOSL antibodies. Interactions
between Tregs and FL B cells resulted in ICOSL downregulation
on FL B cells. Our results highlight a key role for Tregs in FL
pathogenesis and suggest that targeting the ICOS/ICOSL pathway may be a promising immunotherapy for FL treatment.

Introduction

appears paradoxical, because Tregs from FL tissues were shown
to inhibit the function of antitumor CD4þ and CD8þ T cells
(14–16). Of note, a similar favorable inﬂuence of Tregs has been
also reported in classical Hodgkin lymphoma a lymphoma subtype in which the microenvironment is known to play a key
role (17). Nonetheless, the favorable prognostic value of Tregs in
FL remains controversial because it was not clearly conﬁrmed in
recent studies (18–20).
Tregs lack CD127 (IL7 receptor a chain) and usually express
CD25 (IL2 receptor a chain), GITR (glucocorticoid-induced
TNFR-related protein), CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4), and CD45RO (21). Expression of the transcription factor FoxP3 (forkhead box P3) is considered as a crucial
feature for the development and function of Tregs (21). Lymphoma B cells produce the CCL22 chemokine inducing Treg recruitment (15) and converting conventional T cells (Tconv) to Tregs
(22–24). Cell contacts were shown to be required for this conversion, which involves CD70, CD80, and CD86 expression on B
cells (22, 24).
ICOS (inducible T cell costimulator, CD278)/ICOSL pathway–
driven generation of Tregs has been recently demonstrated in the
periphery (25) and microenvironment of solid tumors (26–28).
ICOS, a costimulatory molecule of the CD28 family, is expressed
on activated T cells. ICOS is involved in T-cell responses upon
engagement with its ligand, ICOSL (ICOSLG, B7-H2, CD275),
which is normally expressed on B cells, dendritic cells, and
monocytes (29). ICOS expression confers an activated phenotype
and a strong suppressive capacity to intratumoral Tregs (30).
Particular Tregs displaying strong expression of ICOS and CXCR5

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is usually considered as an indolent
disease, but some patients present resistance to treatment and/or
transformation into aggressive lymphoma (1). The clinical outcome of FL patients was shown to be inﬂuenced by tumorinﬁltrating macrophages and T cells (2–5), including CD4þ
regulatory T cells (Treg).
Tregs comprise natural and inducible Tregs, that can modulate
immune responses by suppressive mechanisms (6). Accumulation of Tregs was found in various hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies (6). In contrast with solid tumors, in which
Tregs suppress antitumor immunity and promote tumor progression (7–10), high amounts of intratumoral FoxP3þ Tregs were
associated with a favorable outcome in FL (11–13). This result

ICOS Costimulation of Tregs in Follicular Lymphoma

and inhibiting CD4þ effector T cells were recently identiﬁed in FL
tissues, and called follicular regulatory T cells (TFR; ref. 31). This
subset is reminiscent of TFR observed in normal follicles in mice
(32, 33). Nonetheless, the hypothesis of a direct suppressive
function of Tregs on FL B cells has not been fully investigated.
These observations prompted us to clarify the role of Tregs in FL,
using a combination of ﬂow cytometry, cell sorting, and IHC on
tissue samples. As a control group, we analyzed tissue samples
from not only benign lymphadenitis, but also lymphoma subtypes in which the microenvironment is suspected to play a
signiﬁcant role, especially cHL, and to a lesser extent diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Materials and Methods
Patients
Fresh biopsy samples from 46 patients were collected at diagnosis. Samples were classiﬁed as FL (n ¼ 20), DLBCL (n ¼ 10), cHL
(n ¼ 9), and reactive lymphadenitis (rL; n ¼ 7) according to the
World Health Organization classiﬁcation (IARC, Lyon, 2008).
DLBCL cases were considered as de novo cases, due to the lack of
previous history of FL and absence of FL histologic features. All
patients gave informed consent and the study was approved by the
ethical board of the Paoli-Calmettes and Albert Bonniot institute.
Cell lines
Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji and COS-7 cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Raji and COS-7
cells were respectively cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Lonza) and in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% FCS. These cell lines were not authenticated at the time we
performed the study.
Cell isolation and puriﬁcation
Sample tissues were mechanically disrupted and passed
through a nylon ﬁlter (BD Bioscience) to obtain mononuclear
cells (MC), which were frozen or used immediately for functional
assay.
B cells and CD4þ T cells were obtained from MCs by negative
selection (Stemcell Technologies). To isolate Tregs and Tconv,
puriﬁed intratumoral CD4þ T cells were labeled with anti-CD4PC7, anti-CD25-APC, anti-CD127-FITC, and a viability marker
(live/dead aqua) and sorted by FACs (BD Biosciences). To separate ICOSþ and ICOSneg CD4þ T cells, intratumoral CD4þ T cells
were labeled with anti-ICOS-PE and live/dead aqua.
Antibodies and ﬂow cytometry
Antibodies are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. To analyze
intracellular markers like FoxP3, Helios, Bcl-2, and Ki67, cells
were ﬁxed/permeabilized after surface staining and then incubated with speciﬁc antibodies using Foxp3 staining buffer set
(eBioscience). Data were acquired on LSRII (BD Biosciences) and
analyzed using FACS Diva and FlowJo softwares.
Mice model
Na€ve wild-type FVB/N (Charles River Laboratory) were used at
6 weeks of age. Mice were maintained in the pathogen-free animal
facility "AniCan" at the Cancer Research Center of Lyon. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the European and
French laws and were validated by the local animal ethical

www.aacrjournals.org

evaluation committee (CECCAP ethical committee agreement
no. CECCAPP-2013-010 and registered at the MESR, #02312.01).
Mice were injected with either anti-mICOS mAb (17G9, rat
IgG2) or isotype control (BioXcell; 100 mg/mL) by i.p. route and
sacriﬁced after 24 hours or 48 hours. Blood was collected by
intracardiac function, and lymph node and spleen were subjected
to mechanical disaggregation to obtain homogenous single-cell
suspension. Membrane multiparametric ﬂow cytometry stainings
(CD45-AF-700, CD3-APC-H7, CD19-BV605, ICOS-L-PE, and
live/dead Aqua) were performed to evaluate ICOS expression on
CD19þ B cells after gating on viable cells (live/dead Aquaneg). A
multistaining including an IgG2a-PE in place of anti-ICOSL Mab
(FMO) was used as a negative control. Flow cytometry analyses
were performed on an LSR-II (Becton Dickinson), and results were
analyzed using FlowJo software.
T-cell proliferation and suppression assays
To study proliferative capacity, CellTrace violet (Life Technologies)–labeled Tregs and Tconv were activated by CD3/CD28
dynabeads (Life Technologies; 1 bead for 1 cell) in the presence of
recombinant human IL2 (rIL2, 100 IU/mL; Chiron) for 5 days. To
evaluate the suppressive effects of Tregs on CD4þ Tconv, CellTrace
violet–labeled Tconv were activated by CD3/CD28 dynabeads in
the presence of rIL2 (100 IU/mL) and Tregs for 4 days. Cells were
harvested and stained with anti-CD2-PECF-594 and live/dead
near-IR. Proliferation was evaluated by Division index (DI) using
the proliferation tool of FlowJo software. Supernatants of coculture were collected and IFNg was further measured by ELISA (BD
Biosciences).
B-cell suppression assay
FL B cells puriﬁed from tissues were stained with CellTrace
violet and were cultured with autologous or allogeneic Tregs
(1/1 ratio) in the presence of rIL2 (100 IU/mL) for 5 days.
Anti-IgA/G/M (10 mg/mL; Jackson ImmunoReseach) and CpGB (2 mg/mL; Invivogen) were added to stimulate FL B cells as
previously described (34). To study T-cell–dependent suppression of Tregs, an equal number of Tconv and/or Tregs were added
to stimulated B cells. Supernatant of coculture was collected to
measure IL6 by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Kinetics of ICOSL expression on lymphoma B cells
Puriﬁed FL B cells or total MCs were cultured in culture
medium. Cells were harvested and stained with live/dead aqua,
anti-CD19-FITC, anti-ICOSL-PE, and anti-CD86-APC before and
during culture. FL B cells were cultured overnight until ICOSL was
expressed. Then, different ratios of intratumoral ICOSþ or
ICOSneg CD4þ T cells were added on the B cell culture. In some
experiments, anti-ICOS–blocking antibody (314.8 clone, produced in our laboratory) or isotype control (Ctrl) IgG1 (Sigma)
were added at 10 mg/mL.
Treg induction assay
CellTrace violet-labeled intratumoral CD4þ T cells were cultured alone or with autologous or allogeneic FL B cells expressing
ICOSL at 1.5/1 ratio in the presence of rIL2 (100 IU/mL). AntiICOS (314.8 clone) or anti-ICOSL (MIH.12 clone, eBioscience)
blocking antibodies or isotype Ctrl IgG1 were added at 10 mg/mL
for each. After 5 to 6 days, cells were harvested and surface stained
with anti-CD4-PC7, anti-CD19-PECF-594, anti-CD25-APC, anti-

ICOS-PE, and live/dead near-IR before ﬁxation/permeabilization
and intracellular staining with FoxP3-FITC.
Cells harvested after 5 to 6 days of coculture were restimulated
with PMA (10 ng/mL; Sigma) and Ionomycin (1 mg/mL, Sigma)
for 4 hours. After stimulation, cells were stained with anti-CD4V450, anti-CD19-PECF-594, anti-CD25-PC7, anti-FoxP3-PE,
anti-IFNg-FITC, anti-IL2-APC and live/dead near-IR.
IHC
IHC was performed on whole sections of parafﬁn blocks used
for diagnosis. After dewaxing and pressure-cooker antigen retrieval, mAbs directed against ICOS (clone sp98; Abcam), and FoxP3
(clone 236A/E7; eBioscience) were incubated in an automated
immunostainer (Dako) using a standard avidin biotin peroxidase
technique. Double staining experiments were performed using
the K5361 Envision G/2 Doublestain System (Dako) according to
the supplier's instructions. ICOSL IHC was performed on frozen
tissue sections using the Envision-Flex K8000 kit (Dako) and the
Autostainer Plus device (Dako). The anti-ICOSL mAb HIL-270
(provided by Pr. Richard Kroczek) was diluted at 10 mg/mL and
incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. As a control for the
speciﬁcity of the HIL-270 ICOSL mAb, parafﬁn-embedded cell
blocks were constructed using ICOSL-transfected COS-7 cells and
parental COS-7 cells as negative control. Brieﬂy, COS-7 cells
transfected for 48 hours with bDNA4 vector containing full-length
human ICOSL (produced in our laboratory) using X-tremGENE 9
DNA Transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 hours, transfected and parental COS7 cells were detached and preﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde solution
and then suspended in agarose 1% LMT to form a cell-agarose
gel, which was ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde solution for 24 hours.
After ﬁxation, the cell-agarose gel was ﬁxed, dehydrated, parafﬁn impregnated on a Leica ASP300S processor (Leica Biosystems), and ﬁnally embedded in parafﬁn using a Leica HistoEmbedded processor. The method for ICOSL IHC on parafﬁn
embedded cell blocks was similar to that described for ICOS
and FoxP3. As expected, positive HIL-270 immunostaining was
present only in ICOSL-transfected cells. For all antibodies,
including HIL-270, a control was also done by omitting the
primary mAb on serial sections of frozen tissues analyzed,
which resulted in a lack of positive signal.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from puriﬁed FL B cells and Burkitt
lymphoma cell line Raji with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol and was then
reverse transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR was performed
using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix and primers as
follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
Unigene reference: Hs.544577) and human ICOSL (Hs. 14155;
Life Technologies). Gene expression was measured using the
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). For
each sample, mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH as a
reference gene.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative variables were expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software
(GraphPad software) using the Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon
nonparametric t test ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01).

Results
Intratumoral T cells with CD4þCD25highCD127low/– proﬁle
have characteristics of effector Tregs
Coexpression of CD25high and CD127low/neg was used to identify and isolate Tregs in FL tissue samples (Fig. 1A). CD25high
CD127low/neg cells expressed high levels most Treg markers such as
FoxP3 (86%  9.1%, mean  SD), Helios (84%  7.6%; Fig. 1B)
and strongly expressed other Tregs markers such as GITR (72 
13.4), surface CTLA-4 (32.8%  11%), and CD39 (80.2% 
16.1%; Fig. 1B). Most CD25highCD127low/neg Tregs expressed
CD27 (99.2%  1.1%) and were CD45RA-negative (3.2% 
1.6%; Fig. 1B), suggesting a memory T-cell phenotype. Tconv
were identiﬁed as CD25neg/low among viable CD4þ T cells (Fig.
1A). When compared to Tconv, puriﬁed CD25highCD127low/neg
Tregs had a low proliferation rate in response to CD3/CD28
stimulation (87% and 10% for Tconv and Tregs, respectively;
Fig. 1C). Tconv proliferation and IFNg production was strongly
inhibited when CD25highCD127low/neg cells were added in culture
(Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CD25high
CD127low/neg T cells have the phenotypic and functional proﬁle of
effector Tregs.
Intratumoral accumulation of ICOSþ Tregs is a speciﬁc feature
of FL
The mean percentage of Tregs within CD4þ T cells was significantly increased in FL tissues as compared to rL (7.5-fold, P ¼
0.0005), cHL (2.6-fold, P ¼ 0.003) and DLBCL (2.3-fold, P ¼
0.01; Fig. 2A). Both Tregs/Tconv and Tregs/TCD8þ ratios were
signiﬁcantly higher in FL than in other samples (Fig. 2B). ICOS
was mostly expressed in CD4þ T cells, especially in Tregs (65.3% 
14.4%), as compared with other tumor inﬁltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) like CD8þ T cells, gd T cells, and natural killer cells (Fig. 2C).
Accordingly, the percentage of ICOSþ Tregs among CD4þ T cells
was signiﬁcantly increased in FL tumors (Fig. 2D). Like the
majority of Tregs in FL, ICOSþ Tregs expressed CXCR5 (mean
 SD: 83%  7.5%; Fig. 2E). When compared to ICOSneg Tregs,
ICOSþ Tregs in FL tissues displayed signiﬁcant upregulation of
surface CTLA-4 (40.1%  10.1%), GITR (83.6%  10.2%), CD39
(85%  15.9%), PD1 (90.4%  7.9%) as well as higher Ki67
expression (19.1%  7.2%; Fig. 2E). These data indicate a speciﬁc
accumulation of activated and expanding ICOSþ Tregs in the FL
microenvironment.
ICOSL is occasionally expressed in neoplastic B cells from
DLBCL, but is downregulated in FL B cells
To identify a putative cell population responsible for ICOSþ
Tregs accumulation in fresh FL tissues, we assessed the expression
of ICOSL and CD86 on FL B cells, reactive T cells, myeloid dendritic
cells (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC). FL B cells were identiﬁed as CD3neg/CD16neg/CD56neg/CD20þ, because most of these
cells in FL samples were shown to be neoplastic B cells due to
coexpression of CD10 and Bcl-2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). pDCs
were identiﬁed as lineageneg/HLA-DRþ/CD33neg/þ/CD123þ and
mDCs as lineageneg/HLA-DRþ/CD33þþ/CD123neg (Fig. 3A).
CD86 was strongly expressed on mDCs (90.6%  10.1%), pDCs
(21.8%  15.9%), and FL B cells (52.6%  27.3%), but ICOSL was
weak on all cell populations (Fig. 3B) including reactive T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Surprisingly, only ICOSL expression
was rapidly upregulated on FL B cells after a few hours of culture in
vitro of puriﬁed FL B cells (Fig. 3C). ICOSL expression was weak on

We evaluated the impact of FL T cells on ICOSL expression by
cocultures of conditioned FL B cells with either autologous

observed in the presence of ICOSþ CD4þ T cells (Fig. 5A). A high
level of ICOSL expression could be restored on FL B cells using an
antagonist anti-ICOS antibody (314.8; Fig. 5B). Similar results
were also observed in both in vitro culture of total MCs and in vivo
using normal murine model (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast,
no alteration of CD86 expression on FL B cells was observed (Fig.
5B). These data suggest that ICOS/ICOSL interaction is involved
in downregulating ICOSL expression on FL B cells.
ICOS/ICOSL interaction induced enrichment of CD25high
FoxP3high Tregs in FL
We next explored the possible causes of Treg accumulation in FL
tissues. We cocultured puriﬁed FL B cells conditioned to express
ICOSL by in vitro culture, with intratumoral autologous or allogeneic CD4þ T cells in the presence of rIL2 for 5 to 6 days.
Intratumoral CD4þ T cells were labeled with CellTrace violet
prior coculture to evaluate the division rate. We ﬁrst observed
an enhancement of CD25 and FoxP3 expression on CD4þ T cells
(data not shown). Consequently, the number of Tregs, deﬁned by
CD25 and FoxP3 coexpression, was signiﬁcantly increased in the
presence of FL B cells (median, 33.5% versus 20.0%; n ¼ 6; P ¼
0.03; Fig. 6A, left). These Tregs comprised two distinct subsets of
CD25þFoxP3þ and CD25highFoxP3high Tregs (Fig. 6A, right).
Median percentages of CD25þFoxP3þ Tregs were 29.2% following coculture with FL B cells, versus 19.9% (P ¼ 0.03) without FL B

cells. The number of CD25highFoxP3high Tregs was virtually undetectable without FL B cells, but clearly increased during coculture.
Their median percentage was 3.0% and 9.4% per total CD4þ T
cells and per total Tregs, respectively (P ¼ 0.03). Proliferation of
Tregs in culture with FL B cells was signiﬁcant, reaching 47.9% and
20.5% of CD25highFoxP3high Tregs and CD25þFoxP3þ Tregs,
respectively (Fig. 6B, top). ICOS expression was markedly higher
on CD25highFoxP3high Tregs than on CD25þFoxP3þ Tregs [mean
ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI): 1451 vs. 573, respectively; Fig. 6B,
bottom]. After restimulation of cell suspension using PMA/ionomycin, intracellular cytokines were detected (Fig. 6C). FoxP3neg
CD4þ T cells strongly secreted IL2 (median 23%) and IFNg
(median: 13.4%). In contrast, both putative Treg subsets showed
weak IL2 and IFNg secretion. Median percentages among CD25þ
FoxP3þ Tregs were 5.3% and 1.9% for IL2 and IFNg, respectively.
Median percentages among CD25highFoxP3high Tregs were 4.6%
and 1.1% for IL2 and IFNg, respectively. These data indicate that
both cell populations were indeed Tregs rather than activated T
cells. Thus, FL B cells expressing ICOSL could favor intratumoral
enrichment of ICOSþ Tregs.
When neutralizing anti-ICOS and anti-ICOSL mAbs were
added in coculture, there were not signiﬁcant change in the
percentage of CD25þFoxP3þ Tregs among CD4þ T cells (Fig.
6D, left), whereas both mAbs induced a signiﬁcant reduction in
the percentage of CD25highFoxP3high Tregs (Fig. 6D, right). No

impact was observed after the addition of an isotype control IgG1.
These results indicate that generation of CD25highFoxP3high Tregs
expressing ICOS is strongly dependent on ICOSL expression by FL
B cells.
Intratumoral Tregs directly inhibit FL B cells for both
T-cell–dependent and T-cell–independent responses
Our observation of Tregs overrepresentation in FL tumors
prompted us to test their capacity to inhibit FL B cells. We selected
IL6 as one of the main B cell–produced cytokine (37). We ﬁrst
tested whether Tregs could act on B cells activated in a T-cell–
independent way. FL B cells were activated by CpG-B and anti-IgA/
G/M prior to culture with Tregs at 1:1 ratio. We observed a
signiﬁcant attenuation of CD80 and CD86 expression on FL B
cells. This was evidenced by the percentage for CD80 (approximately 30% of inhibition, P ¼ 0.0078, n ¼ 9) and by MFI for
CD80 and CD86 (about 35% and 31% inhibition for CD80 and
CD86, respectively (Fig. 7A). Similarly, Tregs abrogated IL6 secretion in the supernatant of FL B cells (median percentage of 26%
inhibition, P ¼ 0.0078, n ¼ 8; Fig. 7B).
Tconv in FL samples could also be suppressed by Tregs (Fig.
1D). About a quarter (25.2%  16.1%, n ¼ 12) of these Tconv
were TFH cells characterized by ICOS and CXCR5 coexpression
(data not shown). We next searched for a putative suppression
of Tconv-driven B-cell responses by Tregs. For this purpose,
stimulated B cells were cocultured with Tconv, with or without
Tregs at 1:1 ratio. Tconv induced a signiﬁcant increase of both
CD80 and CD86 expression on stimulated B cells, and of IL6
secretion (median increase of 67%, 121%, and 49% for CD80
MFI, CD86 MFI, and IL6, respectively). B-cell responses were
inhibited after addition of Tregs (inhibition of 44%, 53%, and
39% for CD80 MFI, CD86 MFI, and IL6, respectively; Fig. 7C
and D).
Of note, there was also a tendency for Tregs to suppress B-cell
proliferation, although it was not statistically signiﬁcant for all
samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). These data suggest that intratumoral Tregs can directly or indirectly suppress FL B-cell
responses upon activation.

Discussion
Clarifying the impact of Tregs on FL pathogenesis is a critical
issue for clinical implications. However, the lack of strictly a
speciﬁc Treg marker may result in discrepancies between studies
focusing on Tregs in human. FoxP3, which is considered as the
most speciﬁc Treg marker, was reported to be transiently expressed
in activated CD4þ and CD8þ T cells (38, 39), which, in contrast to
Tregs, produce effector cytokines like IL2 and IFNg (23, 39, 40).
Using the CD25high/CD127low/neg combination, we could isolate
T cells displaying Treg phenotypic markers and strong suppressive
activity. Most CD25highCD127low/neg T cells were FoxP3high and
hardly secreted IL2 and IFNg, further supporting their Tregs'
nature. Thus, our results corroborate previous investigations
(41, 42) suggesting that the CD25highCD127low/neg combination
is useful for Tregs' identiﬁcation.

to promote generation of these intratumoral ICOSþ/CD25highFoxP3high Tregs via ICOS/ICOSL interaction, which induced
ICOSL downregulation on FL B cells. Furthermore, we provide
evidence of a strong suppressive effect of intratumoral Tregs on
malignant B cells.
Several studies have shown a favorable outcome for FL patients
with high amounts of intratumoral Tregs, although this remains
controversial (18, 43). These observations support the hypothesis
that Tregs could control malignant FL cells, but no demonstration
of such functional interaction was reported so far. In nontumoral
human tonsils, B-cell responses were shown to be inhibited by
Tregs (44, 45). We report herein that Tregs are able to suppress the
activation process and cytokine secretion of FL B cells, either
directly or indirectly.
Tregs are known to use various mechanisms to suppress
immune responses, including cell-to-cell contact (45). Additionally, Tregs are known to kill B cells through Fas–FasL
interaction or through the release of cytolytic molecules
(46, 47). So, further study is needed to identify mechanisms
involved in direct FL B cell inhibition. The indirect suppressive
effect of Tregs upon FL B cells is in accordance with a report
showing that TFH cells support FL B-cell activity via IL4 and
CD40L (31). Our data suggest that Tregs are able to inhibit IL4/
CD40L-producing T cells, probably including TFH, which could
hamper FL growth.
Nonetheless, the favorable prognostic value of high numbers
of Tregs in FL tumors remains debated (11–13). In mouse
models, depletion of Tregs induced decreased lymphoma burden (48). Unfavorable outcome was reported for FL patients
with high levels of peripheral blood Tregs (49). A possible
explanation that may reconcile the latter studies with our
results may reside in the polarization of Tregs into distinct
functional subsets. Tregs expressing Tbet, IRF4, STAT3, and Bcl6
appear to control Th1-, Th2-, Th17-, and TFH-mediated immune
responses, respectively (32, 50–52). Therefore, it is possible
that intratumoral ICOSþ Tregs include multiple subsets, with
opposite effects on tumor growth. The balance between these
antagonist Tregs subsets may vary according to complex cues
from the microenvironment. In this extent, it is noteworthy that
we also observed a signiﬁcant Tregs' increase in tissue samples
from cHL, a lymphoma subtype that is known to undergo, like
FL, crucial inﬂuences from the microenvironment, including a
suspected favorable effect of Treg accumulation. This raises the
question as to whether similar signaling networks could regulate Tregs in FL and cHL. The dependence of Tregs' status on the
microenvironment of particular lymphoma subtypes is also
supported by the previous observation that impoverishment
of the Treg pool in angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
(AITL) resulted from a proinﬂammatory microenvironment
involving Th17 cells (53, 54).
We observed an increase in the amount of Tregs, including
ICOSþ/CD25highFoxp3high Tregs, among CD4þ T cells in coculture with FL B cells. This result is consistent with recent reports
of Treg differentiation induced by malignant B cells (22–24).
Tregs' increase could be due to either Tconv conversion or Tregs
expansion. Our observation of signiﬁcant Ki67 expression in
ICOSþ Tregs favors the view of Tregs' expansion. On the other
hand, it is also possible that lymphoma cells could convert
Tconv to Tregs, as previously reported (22, 23). Tregs enrichment in FL tumors probably result from the combination of
diverse mechanisms, including conversion and expansion, as

4658 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

well as migration of Tregs induced by CCL17- and CCL22secreting FL B cells (55).
Survival, expansion, and suppressive functions of human
Tregs are known to be strongly dependent on ICOS costimulation in physiologic settings (25). Accordingly, we show that
coculture of ICOSLþ FL B cells with T cells induced generation
of ICOSþ/CD25highFoxP3high Tregs. Using neutralizing antibodies, we show that ICOS/ICOSL interaction is critical for this
induction. ICOSL expression on FL B cells was downregulated
following interaction with ICOSþ T cells, which may explain
why ICOSL was undetectable in vivo. It remains, however,
difﬁcult to decipher what could be the primum movens of the
cascade of ICOS/ICOSL interactions in vivo. Whatever the
triggering event could be in FL, such a mechanism is globally
reminiscent to that described in other human cancers, in which
ICOSþ Tregs' enrichment is triggered by ICOSL produced by
pDCs or tumor cells (26–28). Thus, our ﬁndings provide a basis
to target the ICOS/ICOSL pathway for the development of
future immunotherapies in FL patients.
