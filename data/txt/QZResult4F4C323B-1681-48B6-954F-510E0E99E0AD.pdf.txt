Antiangiogenesis Enhances Intratumoral Drug Retention
Jie Ma, Chong-Sheng Chen, Todd Blute, and David J. Waxman

Abstract
The tumor vasculature delivers nutrients, oxygen, and therapeutic agents to tumor cells. Unfortunately, the
delivery of anticancer drugs through tumor blood vessels is often inefficient and can constitute an important
barrier for cancer treatment. This barrier can sometimes be circumvented by antiangiogenesis-induced
normalization of tumor vasculature. However, such normalizing effects are transient; moreover, they are
not always achieved, as shown here, when 9L gliosarcoma xenografts were treated over a range of doses with the
VEGF receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors axitinib and AG-028262. The suppression of tumor blood
perfusion by antiangiogenesis agents can be turned to therapeutic advantage, however, through their effects on
tumor drug retention. In 9L tumors expressing the cyclophosphamide-activating enzyme P450 2B11, neoadjuvant axitinib treatment combined with intratumoral cyclophosphamide administration significantly increased
tumor retention of cyclophosphamide and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. Similar increases
were achieved using other angiogenesis inhibitors, indicating that increased drug retention is a general response
to antiangiogenesis. This approach can be extended to include systemic delivery of an anticancer prodrug that is
activated intratumorally, where antiangiogenesis-enhanced retention of the therapeutic metabolite counterbalances the decrease in drug uptake from systemic circulation, as exemplified for cyclophosphamide.
Importantly, the increase in intratumoral drug retention induced by neoadjuvant antiangiogenic drug treatment
is shown to increase tumor cell killing and substantially enhance therapeutic activity in vivo. Thus, antiangiogenic agents can be used to increase tumor drug exposure and improve therapeutic activity following
intratumoral drug administration, or following systemic drug administration in the case of a therapeutic
agent that is activated intratumorally. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2675–85. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The tumor vasculature is often characterized by low vascularity, poor organization, and abnormal morphology, which
results in inefficient transport of oxygen and therapeutic agents
into tumors and constitutes a substantial barrier to effective
cancer treatment (1). Extensive efforts have been made to
improve tumor drug uptake by developing new delivery vehicles
or increasing tumor vascular patency (2, 3). The growth and
expansion of many tumors is associated with pathological
angiogenesis stimulated by VEGF, which is a validated therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Bevacizumab, a neutralizing antibody for human VEGF, is an antiangiogenic drug that
increases the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer when given in combination with conventional chemotherapy (4, 5). Small-molecule
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) that inhibit VEGF

receptors (VEGFR) can also be used to induce antiangiogenesis.
However, despite efficacy observed in clinical trials with several
such RTKIs (6, 7), recent phase III trials showed very limited
benefits when antiangiogenic RTKIs were combined with conventional chemotherapy (8–10). These observations raise the
question as to how antiangiogenesis treatments affect tumor
uptake of other chemotherapeutic agents and the overall antitumor activity of combination therapies.
Morphological normalization of surviving tumor blood vessels has been observed following treatment with a variety of
antiangiogenic drugs (11). It has been proposed that antiangiogenesis may transiently normalize the tumor vasculature, leading to an increase in tumor drug uptake (12). Like the
antiangiogenic antibodies bevacizumab and DC101, the VEGF
receptor-selective RTKI axitinib (13) induces morphological
normalization of the tumor vasculature and can increase the
transport efficiency of individual blood vessels that survive
antiangiogenesis treatment (14, 15). However, the total number
of surviving blood vessels decrease and overall tumor blood
perfusion is not improved by axitinib treatment, as indicated
by the increase in tumor hypoxia and the decrease in tumor
uptake of small molecules, including 4-OH-CPA, the active metabolite of the anticancer prodrug cyclophosphamide (CPA; refs.
14, 16). This lack of improved tumor vascular functionality
("normalization") by axitinib and certain other antiangiogenic
drugs (17–20) could be the result of doses that are optimized for
maximal angiogenesis inhibition with acceptable host toxicity

but are not optimal for vascular normalization. Supporting this
possibility, increases in chemotherapeutic drug uptake are seen
in some tumor models at low but not standard doses of the
antiangiogenic agent sunitinib (21, 22), and improved antitumor
responses are reported when bevacizumab is given to patients
at low dose, but not high dose, in combination with conventional chemotherapy (23). An alternative reason why certain VEGF
receptor RTKIs might not induce normalization may due to
their coinhibition of PDGFR-b, which promotes the close association between pericytes and endothelial cells that characterizes normal blood vessels (24), thereby destabilizing tumor blood
vessels in a way that interferes with tumor vascular normalization induced by VEGF deprivation. These two possibilities are
examined in the present study, where the impact of antiangiogenesis on tumor drug uptake is investigated over a range of
doses for both axitinib and AG-028262, an antiangiogenic RTKI
whose specificity for VEGFR-2 as compared with PDGFR-b is
approximately 50-fold greater than that of axitinib (25).
As blood flow to the tumor decreases in response to antiangiogenesis, blood flow out of the tumor may also decrease.
This could potentially increase the retention of therapeutic
agents in tumors. Furthermore, for drugs that successfully
extravasate into the tumor extracellular matrix, a decrease in
tumor interstitial fluid pressure following antiangiogenesis
treatment may slow the leakage of drugs from the tumor
periphery to the peritumoral space and could also lead to
longer tumor drug retention. However, the inhibition of VEGF
signaling reduces the permeability of blood vessels and can
adversely affect the extravasation of drugs after they are delivered into the tumor through blood circulation (26). Thus, even if
antiangiogenesis increase the retention of therapeutic agents in
tumor vasculature, it is uncertain whether this can be translated
into increased interstitial drug concentration and higher tumor
cell drug exposure. These questions are presently investigated
in a 9L gliosarcoma model that expresses cytochrome P450
2B11, which converts the anticancer prodrug CPA to its active,
4-hydroxy metabolite (27). Our findings demonstrate that pretreatment of P450 2B11–expressing tumors with angiogenesis
inhibitors significantly increases tumor retention of CPA, as
well as 4-OH-CPA, following intratumoral CPA delivery, leading
to increases in tumor cell apoptosis and antitumor activity.
Furthermore, we show that for a prodrug that can be administered systemically and activated intratumorally, as exemplified
by CPA, the decrease in tumor drug uptake following angiogenesis inhibition can be fully reversed by the tumor drug retention
effect induced by the same antiangiogenesis treatment.

retroviral vector pBabe (9L cells) were described previously
(28). Cells were grown in DMEM culture medium containing
10% FBS at 37 C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Immune-deficient male Fox Chase ICR scid mice were purchased from Taconic, Inc. and housed in the Boston University
Laboratory of Animal Care Facility in accordance with
approved protocols and federal guidelines. Autoclaved cages
containing food and water were changed once a week. Mouse
body weight was monitored every 3 to 4 days. On the day of
tumor cell inoculation, 9L or 9L/2B11 cells at 70% to 80%
confluence were trypsinized and resuspended in FBS-free
DMEM medium. Cells (4  106) in a volume of 0.2 mL were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into each flank of a 6-week-old
male scid mouse. Tumor sizes were measured every 3 to 4 days
using digital calipers (VWR International) and volumes were
calculated as (3.14/6)  (L  W)3/2.
Tumor growth delay study
Mice bearing bilateral 9L/2B11 tumors were randomized
into five groups on the day of initial drug treatment, when the
average tumor volume reached 800 to 900 mm3 (5–8 mice per
group), and treated as follows: (i) vehicle injection [5 mL per g
body weight, i.p., once a day (sid) for 4 days], followed by
120 mL PBS sid for 2 days, administered at 3 intratumoral
injection sites per tumor at 20 mL per injection and 2 tumors/
mouse beginning 24 hours after the last vehicle injection;
(ii) axitinib (25 mg/kg body weight, i.p., sid for 4 days); (iii) CPA
[150 mg CPA/kg body weight in a total vol of 120 mL,
administered at 3 intratumoral (i.t.) injection sites per tumor
at 20 mL per injection site and 2 tumors/mouse], sid for
2 days; (iv) CPA, followed by axitinib given 24 hours after the
second CPA injection; and (v) axitinib, followed by CPA given
24 hour after the fourth axitinib injection. For groups (i) and
(ii), the mice were terminated when the tumor volume
reached the limit set by institutional guidelines. For groups
(iii), (iv), and (v), a second drug treatment cycle was initiated
on day 21, as shown in Figure 6, below, after which the mice
were maintained drug-free. Tumor volume and mouse body
weight were monitored throughout the study.

findings (14). Axitinib also decreased tumor uptake of CPA
and of liver-derived 4-OH-CPA when assayed at the Tmax, 15
minutes after i.p. injection of CPA (Fig 1B and C), indicating
that axitinib suppresses tumor vascular patency, in agreement
with earlier studies (14). To ascertain whether lower doses of
axitinib might induce functional normalization of tumor
blood vessels leading to an increase in tumor drug uptake,
mice were treated with axitinib at doses ranging from 2 to 25
mg/kg [p.o., twice a day (bid)]. No axitinib-dependent increase
in tumor uptake of 4-OH-CPA was seen at any of the doses
tested. A dose of 2 mg/kg axitinib was without effect, whereas
5 mg/kg axitinib resulted in a maximal reduction in the
intratumoral 4-OH-CPA concentration (Fig. 1D). Next, we
investigated whether an increase in tumor vascular patency
and drug uptake could be achieved using AG-208262, a more

www.aacrjournals.org

selective VEGFR-2 RTKI than axitinib (25). AG-028262 induced
a progressive, dose-dependent decrease in intratumoral 4-OHCPA over the full dose range tested (Fig. 1D). At 40 mg/kg, AG208262 suppressed tumor 4-OH-CPA level by 48%, consistent
with its strong antiangiogenic activity. Similar decreases in
tumor uptake of CPA (Supplementary Fig. S1) and 4-OH-CPA
(30) were seen in PC-3 tumors pretreated with axitinib at 25
mg/kg/day for times ranging from 0.5 to 6 days. Thus, VEGFR
inhibition by either axitinib or AG-208262 is not associated
with functional normalization of the tumor vasculature.

be used to increase intratumoral drug retention. CPA was

injected intratumorally into 9L/2B11 tumors, where CYP2B11,
a cytochrome P450 enzyme, catalyzes intratumoral metabolism of CPA to its active metabolite, 4-OH-CPA. CPA that exits
the tumor intact can be converted by liver P450 enzymes to 4OH-CPA, a portion of which may then reenter the tumor (27).
Five minutes after CPA injection, intratumoral CPA levels
were 580 mmol/L in untreated tumors as compared with 1,840
mmol/L in axitinib-pretreated tumors (Fig. 2A). However, the
initial tumor level of 4-OH-CPA was not significantly higher in
the axitinib-pretreated tumors (Fig. 2B), indicating that axitinib does not increase the intrinsic rate of intratumoral CPA
4-hydroxylation, despite the 3.2-fold increase in initial intratumoral CPA concentration. This finding can be explained by
CYP2B11 being already saturated at the concentration of 580
mmol/L CPA that is reached when CPA is injected i.t. without
prior axitinib treatment [c.f., Km (CPA) ¼ 70 mmol/L in 9L/
2B11 cells; ref 28]. As the intratumoral CPA levels declined
with time due to a combination of drug efflux and intratumoral conversion to 4-OH-CPA, we observed an increase in
overall intratumoral 4-OH-CPA exposure with axitinib treatment (Fig. 2B). Total intratumoral exposure to CPA, and 4-OHCPA was 76% to 77% higher in axitinib-pretreated mice, as
indicated by area under the curve (AUC; Table 1). This finding
is consistent with axitinib slowing drug efflux from the
tumors. After 30 minutes, intratumoral 4-OH-CPA levels
declined both with and without axitinib-pretreatment, reflecting depletion of the intratumoral pool of CPA available for
metabolism to 4-OH-CPA. The Cmax of tumor exposure to 4OH-CPA was also increased with axitinib pretreatment, by
42% (Table 1B). CPA and 4-OH-CPA levels were substantially
lower in plasma and liver than in the tumor (Fig. 2C–F), as is
expected for an intratumoral route of drug delivery. Moreover,
at the 5-minute time point, plasma and liver 4-OH-CPA levels
were significantly lower in axitinib-pretreated mice than in
controls (P < 0.05), indicating that the greater retention of CPA
and 4-OH-CPA by the axitinib-pretreated tumor renders CPA
less available for hepatic metabolism and also reduces the
efflux of tumor-derived 4-OH-CPA during this initial time
period. By 30 minutes, however, plasma and liver levels of
CPA and 4-OH-CPA were higher in the axitinib-pretreated
mice, reflecting the delay in drug release from the tumors.
To confirm the role of intratumoral P450 metabolism in the
observed retention of 4-OH-CPA, we used mice bearing wildtype 9L tumors to investigate the impact of axitinib pretreatment on the intratumoral pharmacokinetics of CPA and 4-OHfollowing i.t. CPA injection. Wild-type 9L tumors do not
express significant levels of P450 enzymes and cannot metabolize CPA to 4-OH-CPA. As anticipated, we observed higher
levels of intratumoral CPA in the axitinib-pretreated tumors at
both 6 and 15 minutes, reflecting increased tumor drug
retention (Fig. 2G), however, intratumoral 4-OH-CPA levels
were lower through 30 minutes, reflecting the inhibition of
tumor uptake of 4-OH-CPA formed in the liver (Fig. 2H).
Two other antiangiogenic drugs, AG-028262 and SU5416,
were investigated for their effects on intratumoral drug retention in mice bearing 9L/2B11 tumors (Fig. 3). Four days of
pretreatment with AG-028262 or SU5416 had no significant
effect on intratumoral CPA or 4-OH-CPA levels 15 minutes

2678

after intratumoral CPA injection, although a trend of increasing drug retention was apparent for CPA (Fig. 3A). However, 30
minutes after CPA injection, when intratumoral CPA concentrations decreased well below the Km for metabolism by
CYP2B11 (c.f.; Fig. 2A), both antiangiogenic drugs significantly
increased intratumoral 4-OH-CPA compared with controls (P
< 0.05; Fig. 3B). Thus, prolonged tumor drug retention may
represent a common response to antiangiogenesis treatments
involving these RTKIs.
Although axitinib decreased tumor levels of both CPA and
4-OH-CPA in mice bearing wild-type 9L tumors following i.p.
CPA administration (Fig. 4A and B, left set of bars; also see
Fig. 1B and C; refs. 11, 14), axitinib effected no such decrease in
tumor 4-OH-CPA levels in mice bearing 9L/2B11 tumors either
15 or 30 minutes after i.p. injection of CPA (Fig. 4B). This can
be explained by the increased retention of CPA that enters the
axitinib-pretreated tumors, which makes CPA more available
for metabolism by the tumor cell-expressed P450 2B11
enzyme, and by the increased retention of tumor cell-derived
4-OH-CPA. This increased retention of CPA and 4-OH-CPA in
part compensates for the decreased tumor uptake of 4-OHCPA that is formed in the liver. Thus, antiangiogenesis not
only increases the exposure of tumor cells to drugs delivered
intratumorally, but can also increase intratumoral metabolism, and exposure, to the activated form of a prodrug that is
administered systemically.
In control experiments, we observed that the CPA 4-hydroxylase activity of 9L/2B11 tumor-derived microsomes was not
altered by axitinib pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Hepatic cytochrome P450-catalyzed CPA 4-hydroxylation is
also unaffected by axitinib treatment (14). Thus, the increase
in intratumoral concentration of 4-OH-CPA seen following
axitinib treatment cannot be explained by an increase in the
intrinsic CPA 4-hydroxylase activity of either the liver or
tumor.
Axitinib enhances CPA-induced tumor cell apoptosis
The impact of the enhanced drug retention following
axitinib treatment on tumor cell apoptosis was investigated
by measuring caspase activity in tumor samples excised 24
hours after the last drug treatment. Basal 9L/2B11 tumor
caspase activity was unaffected by axitinib treatment (Fig. 5A).
Intratumoral administration of CPA (50 mg/kg, 2 injections 24
hours apart) significantly increased caspase activity. However,
the highest caspase activity was observed when mice bearing
the intratumoral CPA-treated 9L/2B11 tumors were pretreated with axitinib (Fig. 5A). Thus, the prolonged exposure
of tumor cells to 4-OH-CPA translates into a significant
increase in tumor cell apoptosis. Axitinib had no effect on
the intrinsic sensitivity of endothelial cells to activated CPA, as
determined using cultured HUVEC cells (Fig. 5B).
Axitinib enhances the antitumor activity of
intratumoral CPA injection
The therapeutic impact of axitinib-enhanced tumor drug
retention was investigated in a tumor growth delay study.
Four days of axitinib treatment resulted in a transient (3
day) delay in 9L/2B11 tumor growth, whereas maximum

cycle of drug treatment (Fig. 6A; P < 0.05, 1-way ANOVA, day 0
to day 49 for axitinib/CPA schedule vs. CPA/axitinib schedule).
Similar body weight profiles were observed for the CPA monotherapy and for both axitinib-CPA schedules (Fig. 6B), indicating that no additional toxicities were associated with the
axitinib/CPA schedule. A small body weight loss occurred after
each CPA treatment, as is typical for this cytotoxic drug. Thus,
the extended drug retention associated with neoadjuvant axitinib treatment significantly enhances CPA antitumor activity.

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated how VEGF receptortargeted antiangiogenic agents modulate chemotherapeutic
drug delivery and drug retention by the tumor. Antiangiogenesis was found to decrease tumor uptake of the anticancer
prodrug CPA and its active metabolite, 4-OH-CPA, consistent
with the established requirement for a functional tumor
vasculature and blood flow for effective drug delivery. However, in mice bearing tumors that express the CPA-activating
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2B11, neoadjuvant axitininb
treatment significantly increased the AUC of intratumoral
4-OH-CPA exposure following intratumoral CPA administration, leading to an increase in tumor cell apoptosis and a
major increase in antitumor activity, as seen in tumor growth
delay studies. Increased tumor drug retention was also seen
with two other antiangiogenic agents, indicating that this
effect is a general response to tumor antiangiogenesis. Importantly, the increases in therapeutic activity were achieved
despite the transient nature of the tumor drug retention effect
of neoadjuvant axitinib treatment, and they cannot be
explained by an increase in tumor cell or endothelial cell
chemosensitivity following axitinib treatment (14). Further-

more, no increase in antitumor activity was seen when CPA
treatment preceded axitinib administration, consistent with
the proposed mechanism for the improved therapeutic
response, namely, antiangiogenesis-dependent drug retention
leading to increased tumor cell exposure to 4-OH-CPA. Finally,
when CPA was administered systemically and activated intratumorally, the decreases in tumor uptake of both CPA and 4OH-CPA due to antiangiogenesis were counter-balanced, and
fully compensated for, by antiangiogenesis-induced drug
retention. Thus, when a tumor-activated prodrug is administered systemically, antiangiogenesis-induced drug retention
can counteract the decrease in drug uptake while at the same
time retaining the therapeutic benefits of antiangiogenesisinduced tumor cell starvation.
Antiangiogenesis induces morphological normalization of
the tumor vasculature, which involves pruning of immature
blood vessels, a decrease in blood vessel tortuosity and dilation, and a closer association between pericytes and tumor
endothelial cells (12). This can lead to functional improvements, as shown by the increases in tumor vascular patency
and drug uptake and decreases in tumor hypoxia reported in
preclinical studies with several antiangiogenic agents (31).
However, these effects are short lived and they disappear with
continued antiangiogenic drug treatment (32, 33). Moreover,
for axitinib (15, 34) and certain other antiangiogenic drugs (17,
35, 36), although morphological normalization of the tumor
vasculature and improved functionality of individual blood
vessels may occur, overall tumor vascular patency and capacity for drug uptake actually decrease. Presently, we investigated the hypothesis that tumor blood vessel normalization
leading to increased drug uptake can be achieved by reducing
the dose of the antiangiogenic RTKI; however, we obtained
no evidence for such functional normalization of tumor

Antiangiogenesis Increases Tumor Drug Retention

50 mg/kg on day 5. Tumor levels of CPA (A) and 4-OH-CPA (B) were

vasculature over a more than 10-fold dose range of either
axitinib or AG-028262. Moreover, our studies with AG-028262
rule out cross-inhibition with PDGFR-b as a reason for the
absence of normalization, given the high selectivity of this
RTKI for VEGFR inhibition (25).
The absence of tumor vessel normalization in these preclinical studies is consistent with the limited therapeutic benefit
reported in several phase III clinical trials combining antiangiogenic agents with conventional chemotherapies (8–10). The
poor performance of these combination therapies indicates a
need to consider new approaches, such as the antiangiogenesisinduced tumor drug retention approach reported here. In
particular, for cytotoxic agents that can be delivered or activated
intratumorally, persistent angiogenesis inhibition may further
increase drug retention and therapeutic activity. Other
approaches may include optimization of the timing and sequen-

cing of antiangiogenic agents given in combination with cytotoxic drugs, as discussed elsewhere (11). For antiangiogenic
agents that show limited activity in a monotherapy setting and
that transiently induce functional normalization of the tumor
vasculature, intermittent neoadjuvant antiangiogenesis prior to
each cycle of cytotoxic drug administration may increase tumor
drug uptake. However, for combination therapies that include
potent antiangiogenic drugs that do not induce tumor vascular
normalization, a brief period of antiangiogenic drug treatment
at a reduced dose, or temporary dilation of tumor blood vessels
(37) prior to chemotherapy administration may be required to
minimize the negative impact of angiogenesis inhibition on
tumor drug uptake.
Tumor uptake of 4-OH-CPA, the active metabolite of CPA,
was inhibited by axitinib and AG-028262, which reduce tumor

endothelial cell chemosensitivity. A, Scid mice bearing s.c. 9L/2B11
tumor xenografts pretreated for 4 days with vehicle or axitinib (25 mg/kg,
i.p., sid) were injected with phosphate-buffered-saline (control) or CPA
(50 mg/kg, i.t., 2 injections 24 hours apart). Tumor cell apoptosis was
determined 24 hours after the last drug treatment by measuring caspase
activity in the absence or in the presence of the caspase inhibitor casputin.

blood perfusion and total vascular volume and decrease the
number of patent tumor blood vessels (16, 34). These responses
not only decrease chemotherapeutic drug uptake, but as shown
here, they also decrease the rate at which drug molecules exit
from the tumor, resulting in prolonged drug retention and
increased tumor drug exposure. In the case of 9L/2B11 tumors
given a single intratumoral injection of CPA, axitinib increased
tumor cell exposure to CPA, and to 4-OH-CPA almost 2-fold, as
judged by AUC values. As axitinib also decreases tumor uptake
of liver-derived 4-OH-CPA, with no change in the intrinsic CPA
4-hydroxylase activity of 9L/2B11 tumors, these increases in
tumor drug exposure likely underestimate the extent to which
axitinib inhibits tumor efflux of 4-OH-CPA per se. Indeed,
axitinib decreased the initial rate of tumor efflux of CPA by
approximately 3-fold, as judged from the 3.2-fold higher residual intratumoral CPA concentration determined 5 minutes
after drug injection (1,840 vs. 580 mmol/L). P450 2B11 has a Km
(CPA) of 70 mmol/L in 9L/2B11 cells (28), indicating that tumor

mice. Arrows along the x-axis indicate the days on which CPA was
administered (150 mg/kg, 2 i.t. injections 24 hours apart, drug treatment

treatment was initiated on day 0, when the average tumor size of each
group reached 800 to 900 mm3. A, antitumor activity of intratumoral CPA
injection was substantially prolonged in mice given 4 daily axitinib
injections prior to CPA treatment (Axitinib/CPA schedule) compared
with intratumoral CPA treatment followed by axitinib (CPA/Axitinib
schedule) or intratumoral CPA treatment alone. Axitinib treatment alone
resulted in only a 3 day growth delay. Also see Table 2. B, impact of axitinib

cell capacity for CPA 4-hydroxylation (drug activation) is
saturated during the initial 15 to 30 minutes period after
intratumoral CPA injection. Thus, the increase in tumor cell
apoptosis and therapeutic activity seen in our experiments may
very well underestimate the drug retention effect of antiangiogenesis. A larger increase in therapeutic activity can therefore
be anticipated for other, direct-acting drugs, or in the case of
CPA, for tumors that express a prodrug activation enzyme less
efficient than CYP2B11.
There are several important limitations of the antiangiogenesis-induced tumor drug retention effect reported here.

a
Tumor growth was blocked after initiation of drug treatment (see Fig. 6) and 10 of 14 tumors never doubled in
volume.

First, antiangiogenesis slows down but does not completely
block tumor drug efflux. Moreover, drug retention becomes
less prominent when baseline intratumoral drug concentrations are very low. Presumably, the residual efflux capability
of the tumor vasculature is sufficient for export when the
chemotherapeutic drug is present at low concentrations.
Most important, the same antiangiogenic mechanisms that
increase tumor drug retention also decrease chemotherapeutic drug uptake by the tumor. Thus, to take advantage of
the increase in tumor drug retention and translate it into a
meaningful therapeutic benefit, it needs to be utilized in a
way that overcomes or circumvents the associated decrease
in drug uptake from systemic circulation. This can be
achieved by combining neoadjuvant antiangiogenic treatment with direct delivery of a chemotherapeutic drug into
target tissues. Although intratumoral drug delivery is not
suitable for all solid tumors and may impose certain practical limitations, it has been used in the clinic for treatment
of head and neck cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer (38–
40) and can also be used in cases where tumors are not
amenable to resection or as an adjuvant following tumor
resection (41, 42). The benefits of antiangiogenesis induced
tumor drug retention can also be realized in combination
therapies involving systemic administration of a tumoractivated prodrug. This approach was exemplified for the
P450 prodrug CPA in mice bearing tumors that express
CYP2B11, where the axitinib-dependent decrease in tumor
uptake of CPA and 4-OH-CPA from systemic circulation was
fully compensated by the increase in tumor retention of 4OH-CPA generated intratumorally. This drug retention effect
helps explain our earlier finding that maximal antitumor
activity is achieved in mice bearing 9L/2B11 tumors when
systemic CPA administration is preceded by axitinib treat-

ment (30). Finally, the potential limitations imposed by the
subcutaneous tumor xenografts model used here should be
noted. The tumor microenvironment can have a significant
impact on angiogenesis (43), and malignant gliomas grown
orthotopically may be more hypoxic and less highly vascularized than the subcutaneous 9L tumors used in our studies
(14, 44). These differences in tumor microenvironment may
impact drug uptake as well as the extent to which antiangiogenesis increases overall drug exposure via the drug
retention effect described here.
The principle of antiangiogenesis-induced tumor drug
retention presented here may be applied to systemic treatments based on other therapeutic agents that can be activated
intratumorally, including other P450 prodrugs (29), prodrugs
activated by other enzymes (45), and bioreductive drugs,
which are activated within hypoxic tumor regions (46). Antiangiogenesis-induced tumor drug retention may also be
extended to increase the retention of tumor cell replicating,
oncolytic viral vectors (47) as well as tumor-targeted nanoparticles (48). As tumor-specific delivery of nanoparticles in
part depends on the enhanced permeability and leakiness of
the tumor vasculature (48), the net impact of antiangiogenesis
on tumor vascular permeability and drug retention is uncertain and will require further study. Increased tumor drug
retention can also be expected for agents that transiently
normalize tumor vasculature, once they ultimately decrease
tumor vascular patency with continued use, and for vascular
disrupting agents, which induce an acute interruption of
tumor blood perfusion (49). The latter possibility is supported
by the increased tumor exposure to the alkylating agent
melphalan following pretreatment with the vascular disruption agent 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (50), and by
the increase in activity when doxorubicin was combined
with the vascular disruption agent ICT2588, where maximal
antitumor activity was achieved when doxorubicin was administered after the collapse of the tumor vasculature induced by
ICT2558 (51).
In conclusion, antiangiogenesis-induced tumor drug
retention is an intrinsic action of antiangiogenic drugs
and can be applied to a variety of antiangiogenesis treatments. This drug retention effect was employed to significantly increase the therapeutic activity of CPA treatment in
a 9L xenograft model, and similar benefits can be expected
with other tumor types. An even more pronounced drug
retention effect can be anticipated for chronic antiangiogenesis treatment, when the decrease in functional tumor
vasculature becomes more substantial, and perhaps for
vascular disrupting agents as well. These findings provide
a novel perspective and insight into the complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and interactions
between antiangiogenic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents
and may stimulate further research to take advantage of
these findings in a way that may circumvent the decrease in
drug uptake that is also intrinsic to antiangiogenic therapies.
Finally, certain normal tissues are also sensitive to VEGF/
VEGFR inhibition (25, 52), indicating that the vasculature in
these tissues may also be targeted for antiangiogenesisinduced drug retention.
