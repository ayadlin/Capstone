Abstract
One of the key challenges in anticancer therapy is the toxicity
and poor bioavailability of the anticancer drugs. Nanotechnology can play a pivotal role by delivering drugs in a targeted
fashion to the malignant cells that will reduce the systemic
toxicity of the anticancer drug. In this report, we show a
stepwise development of a nanoparticle-based targeted
delivery system for in vitro and in vivo therapeutic application
in pancreatic cancer. In the first part of the study, we have
shown the fabrication and characterization of the delivery
system containing gold nanoparticle as a delivery vehicle,
cetuximab as a targeting agent, and gemcitabine as an
anticancer drug for in vitro application. Nanoconjugate was
first characterized physico-chemically. In vitro targeting
efficacy, tested against three pancreatic cancer cell lines
(PANC-1, AsPC-1, and MIA Paca2) with variable epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, showed that gold
uptake correlated with EGFR expression. In the second part,
we showed the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the targeted
delivery system. Administration of this targeted delivery
system resulted in significant inhibition of pancreatic tumor
cell proliferation in vitro and orthotopic pancreatic tumor
growth in vivo. Tumor progression was monitored noninvasively by measuring bioluminescence of the implanted
tumor cells. Pharmacokinetic experiments along with the
quantitation of gold both in vitro and in vivo further
confirmed that the inhibition of tumor growth was due to
targeted delivery. This strategy could be used as a generalized
approach for the treatment of a variety of cancers characterized by overexpression of EGFR. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1970–8]

Introduction
Adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is the fourth leading
cause of cancer deaths in the United States (1).Currently, surgery is
the only treatment, although due to its late presentation, only 9% to
15% of patients are suitable for surgery. The median survival for all
stages of pancreatic cancer is f3 to 5 months from diagnosis (2).

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are necessary to combat this
deadly disease.
The underlying problem in the use of anticancer drugs is their
toxicity and poor bioavailability (3). It is expected that if a
nanoparticle-bearing anticancer drugs can be delivered in a
targeted fashion, inhibition of tumor growth with reduced systemic
toxicity will occur. We selected epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) as a target because pancreatic cancer cells overexpress
EGFR (4, 5). It is also overexpressed in a variety of other cancers
such as head and neck, renal, breast, colorectal, prostate, etc (6).
We selected the anti-EGFR antibody Cetuximab (C225) as a
targeting agent. C225 was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with EGFR-positive
colorectal cancer (7–10). It is also approved for the treatment of
non–small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck, and pancreatic cancer, underlining the importance
of this strategy in other malignancies. Moreover, C225 was welltolerated in early clinical studies; most frequent toxicity observed
being the skin toxicity. It exhibited low immunogenicity as <4% of
patient developed antichimeric antibodies in phase I clinical trials.
We have selected gemcitabine as a cytotoxic agent as it is the
current drug of choice for treatment of pancreatic cancer. In 1998,
FDA approved gemcitabine for use in palliative treatment of
patients with pancreatic carcinoma. It is found to have improvements in clinical benefit and survival compared with 5-fluorouracil
(11). Moreover, gemcitabine is also used in the treatment of other
malignancies such as head and neck, lung, breast, and ovarian
cancers (12). Therefore, this strategy could be used as a generalized
approach for the treatment of a variety of cancers including
pancreatic cancer.
As a delivery vehicle, we selected gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The
reasons for selecting AuNPs f5 nm in size for this study are
manifold: (a) recently, AuNPs have been used in various biomedical
applications (13–25); (b) they are easy to synthesize and characterize due to the presence of a characteristic surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) band and a low production cost (18, 26); (c) their
surface chemistry is relatively simple and surface modification
(attaching biomolecules) can be done fairly easily (27); and most
importantly, (d) they are biocompatible and do not elicit toxic
effects (17, 28, 29). Recent reports have shown the absence of
chronic biochemical and hematologic toxicity in mice up to 1 year
after injection of AuNPs (1.9 nm in diameter; ref. 28). Furthermore,
the small size of these nanoparticles may allow them to escape
uptake by mononuclear phagocytic cells and penetrate through the
smallest capillary pores within the human vasculature (17, 30).
We successfully fabricated and characterized AuNPs with C225
and gemcitabine on a single gold core (Au-C225-Gem). We have

also shown that Au-C225-Gem is far more effective in inhibiting
tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo compared
with its nontargeted counterpart. Pharmacokinetic experiments
along with quantitation of gold in targeted versus nontargeted
delivery both in vitro and in vivo further confirmed that the
inhibition of tumor growth was due to targeted delivery. This is the
first report that describes that targeted delivery of a cytotoxic drug
as a gold nanoconjugate can efficiently inhibit in vivo tumor growth
in orthotopic tumor model of pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) and sodium borohydride
(NaBH4) were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. Gemcitabine was
purchased from Eli Lily. C225 was purchased from Bristol-Myers Squib.
The anti-EGFR antibody for Western blot analysis was purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-03).
Cell culture. The pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, PANC-1, and MIA
Paca-2 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured
using RPMI 1640 (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc.) with L-glutamine and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Synthesis of AuNPs. AuNPs were synthesized from HAuCl4 using NaBH4
as a reducing agent as previously described (Supplementary Data; ref. 31).
Synthesis of gold nanoconjugates containing anti-EGFR antibody or
gemcitabine. The synthesis of gold-EGFR antibody conjugates was
performed by incubating anti-EGFR antibody with a nanoparticle
suspension at pH 7.8. The saturation concentration of anti-EGFR was
determined by incubating different concentrations of the antibody with the
AuNPs followed by stability testing using a 140 mmol/L sodium chloride
(NaCl) solution. Eight tubes, each containing 1 mL of AuNPs, were
incubated with increasing concentrations of C225 (anti-EGFR) for 1 h,
followed by treatment with a NaCl solution to a final concentration of
140 mmol/L. Fifteen minutes after the incubation with NaCl, the UV-visible
spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV2401 PC),
and the saturation concentration was determined. Similarly, the saturation
concentration of gemcitabine on AuNPs was determined.
Fabrication of a gold nanoconjugate containing C225 and gemcitabine on a single gold core. To attach both gemcitabine and C225 to AuNP,
incubation experiments were carried out below the 50% saturation
concentration of both reagents. AuNPs were first incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with 2 Ag/mL of C225 at pH 7.8 followed by another 1 h
incubation with 5 Ag/mL of gemcitabine. For aggregation experiments,
140 mmol/L NaCl solution was added to the above solution and incubated
for another 15 min. Subsequently, UV-visible spectra were recorded. For our
in vitro and in vivo studies, a large batch was prepared by incubating 300 mL
of AuNPs with 600 Ag of C225 and 1.5 mg of gemcitabine as described above.
After the final incubation, the nanoconjugates were concentrated by
ultracentrifugation (Sorvall Ultracentrifuge OTD80B using 50.2 Ti Rotor)
at 20,000 rpm for 45 min at 10jC. The purified nanoconjugates were UV
irradiated for 15 to 20 min before in vitro and in vivo studies.
Thermogravimetric analysis. For performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of Au-C225, 150 mL AuNPs were incubated with 300 Ag of C225.
After 1 h, the nanoconjugates were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 45 min,
freeze dried overnight, and analyzed using TGA. Similarly, for TGA analysis
of Au-C225-Gem, 150 mL AuNPs were incubated with 300 Ag of C225 (2 Ag/
mL). After 1 h, the nanoconjugates were further incubated for 1 h with 750
Ag of gemcitabine (5 Ag/mL), centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h, freeze dried
overnight, and analyzed using TGA. The quantification and attachment of
gemcitabine was further confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the resulting supernatant after ultracentrifugation.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was performed on a PHI 5400 instrument using a Mg Ka X-ray (1,253.6
eV) anode source operated at 250 W under a pressure below 2  10 9 torr,
as described previously. Samples were prepared by drop coating the gold
nanoconjugate solution on a clean silicon wafer, and the drops were allowed
to air dry before the measurement (Supplementary Data; ref. 32).

In vitro release studies of gemcitabine from ‘‘2 in 1’’ conjugates. The
quantification of gemcitabine and C225 in the nanoconjugate was already
described in the experimental section. The loose pellet obtained after
ultracentrifugation (as described above) was divided into several fractions.
Each fraction was diluted with equal amount of PBS and incubated at 37jC
for a defined period of time. After the incubation, the solutions were
ultracentrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 10jC for 1 h in a Beckman TL-100
ultracentrifuge using a TLA-100.2 rotor, and the amount of gemcitabine
released into the supernatant was measured by HPLC.
Western blot analysis. The expression of EGFR protein was determined
in untreated AsPC-1, PANC-1, and MIA Paca2 cells by Western blot analysis
(Supplementary Data).
In vitro targeting of Au-C225 to cancer cells expressing EGFR
receptor. Confluent AsPC-1, PANC-1, and MiA Paca-2 cells in 100-mm
tissue culture dishes (in triplicate) were treated for 2 h with the purified
conjugates obtained after ultracentrifugation. The 2-h treatment was
chosen based on previous reports on the internalization of AuNPs, which
stated that longer time points did not increase gold uptake nor did it alter
the pattern of internalization (33). After the 2-h treatment, cells were
thoroughly washed thrice with PBS, trypsinized, and washed again in PBS.
Cells were pooled together from three plates and finally spun down at 1,300
rpm to obtain the pooled pallet to get the optical picture and then either
fixed in Trumps solution for transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
sectioning and imaging under a TEM microscope or resuspended in PBS for
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. Humanized IgG was used as an
isotype control for C225, and the cells were treated with Au-IgG similarly as
described above.
In vitro cell proliferation assay. AsPC-1 cells (2  104) were seeded in
24-well plates, cultured for 1 d in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 5% L-Glutamine, and 1% antibiotics. Cells were then
incubated with different doses of gemcitabine either in the form of a ‘‘2
in 1’’ nanoconjugate (as Au-Anti–EGFR-Gem) or as free gemcitabine in an
equimolar mixture of C225 and gemcitabine (C225 + Gem). After 2 h of
incubation, cells were washed thrice with PBS and finally resuspended with
RPMI 1640 containing serum and antibiotics. After culture for 72 h, 1 ACi
[3H]-thymidine was added and proliferation assay was performed as
previously described (32). Experiments were repeated at least thrice and in
triplicate.
Generation of orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer, noninvasive
imaging, and treatment schedule. AsPC-1 cells were infected with a
lentiviral reporter gene construct containing the bioluminescent reporter
genes firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were
sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to obtain a pure population
of cells expressing GFP/luciferase. The isolated cells (2  106) were then
orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice (ages 4 to 6 wk) as
described previously (34). On day 4 postinjection, bioluminescence was
measured and the mice were randomized into several groups before the
initiation of treatment. In vivo optical imaging for luciferase was done
f20 min after i.p. injection of 3 mg n-Luciferin into each animal using a
Xenogen-IVIS–cooled CCD optical system (Xenogen-IVIS). The doses were
4 mg/kg/dose of C225, either bound (as in Au-C225-Gem) or free, and 2 mg/
kg/dose gemcitabine, either bound (as in Au-anti–EGFR-Gem) or free. As
controls, we used an equimolar mixture of C225 and gemcitabine (C225 +
Gem), Au-C225 (containing 4 mg/kg of C225), or Au-IgG (4 mg/kg of IgG).
The injection schedule was thrice the 1st wk followed by twice on wk 2
and 3. All mice were sacrificed the day after the last injection but before a
final bioluminescence measurement.
Biodistribution of gold using ICP. After the generation of orthotopic
pancreatic tumor models, we injected the nude mice i.p. with Au-C225,
Au-IgG, and Au-C225-gemcitabine and as (C225 + Gem) in separate groups
as described in the treatment schedule (4 mg C225/kg/dose in a gold-bound
form, i.e., Au-C225 or Au-C225-gem or 4 mg IgG/kg/dose for the isotype
control Au-IgG). The treatment schedule was thrice in the 1st wk followed
by twice for subsequent weeks. The day after the last injection, all mice were
sacrificed and different organs (mainly liver and kidney) were collected for
gold analysis. The gold uptake in different organs was measured using ICP
analysis (Supplementary Data).

Pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and gold in the
nanoconjugates were characterized in 4- to 6-wk-old nude mice (three
mice per time point). The mice were injected i.v. through the tail vein with
2 mg/kg of gemcitabine alone or Gem-Au-C225 (2 mg/kg was used to test
the therapeutic efficacy). Blood samples were collected from the mice
under isoflurane anesthesia 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after drug
administration in heparinized tubes containing tetrahydrouridine to
prevent gemcitabine degradation by cytidine deaminase. Gemcitabine and
its major plasma metabolite dFdU were determined using normal phase
HPLC according to the published literature procedure (35). The amount
of gold present in serum was quantified using ICP as described in the
Supplementary Data.
TEM of cells treated with nanoconjugates. TEM sample preparation
involving cells were performed as previously described (33). After the
incubation with nanoconjugates, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged
initially at 1,500 rpm for 5 min (Supplementary Data).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of AuNPs. Physicochemical characterizations of
AuNPs formed by the NaBH4 method were performed using TEM
and UV-visible Spectroscopy. As previously reported (31), the UVVisible spectrum of AuNPs exhibited characteristic SPR bands at
f512 nm, suggesting the formation of spherical AuNPs. The
f5 nm size of the nanoparticles was further confirmed by TEM
(data not shown).
Saturation concentration of C225 and gemcitabine and
stability of the nanoconjugates. A rough approximation of the
amount of any protein or drug needed for saturating AuNPs can be
obtained from their respective saturation curve. Aggregation of
uncovered or partially covered particles is induced by the addition
of 140 mmol/L NaCl and can be monitored by following the SPR
absorbance of AuNPs. The concentration minimizing aggregation
is considered to be the saturation concentration. The extent of
aggregation, however, should decrease with increasing protection
of the AuNP surface either by antibody or by gemcitabine. It is
clear from Fig. 1A that in the absence of any antibody but in the
presence of NaCl, AuNPs completely aggregated and their
absorbance dropped to zero. Protecting the AuNP surface with
C225 prevented aggregation. The extent of aggregation was found
to be minimal at a C225 concentration of 4 Ag/mL. The absorbance
also reached a maximum at 4 Ag C225/mL of AuNP solution. The
shift in the Emax value of the above samples (Fig. 1B) exhibited a
similar trend where the shift reached a maximum in the absence of
any stabilizing antibody and minimum with a C225 concentration
of 4 Ag/mL. The shift in the Emax values and change in the
absorbance of the AuNP solution with a gradual increase in
antibody concentration suggest that the saturation concentration
of C225 on AuNP is 4 Ag/mL. The observed red shift in the Emax
value and an increase in plasmon resonance are consistent with a
increase in the dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the
AuNPs and suggest the conjugation of C225 to AuNP (36). The
saturation concentration of gemcitabine on AuNPs was also
determined separately as described above and it is found to be
20 Ag/mL (data not shown).
Fabrication of ‘‘2 in 1’’ nanoconjugates containing both
C225 and gemcitabine on a single gold core. Incubation
experiments were performed to synthesize Au-C225-Gem at a
50% saturation concentration of C225 and a 25% saturation
concentration of gemcitabine. The SPR absorption gradually
increased with the addition of C225 and gemcitabine, indicating
a better stabilization of AuNPs bound to both components rather
than to an individual component, as expected (Fig. 1C). A similar

Figure 1. The synthesis of gold-EGFR antibody conjugates was performed
by incubating anti-EGFR antibody with a nanoparticles suspension at pH 7.8.
The saturation concentration of anti-EGFR was first determined by incubating
different concentrations of the antibody with the AuNPs followed by stability
testing using a 140 mmol/L NaCl solution. A and B, determination of saturation
curve of C225 on AuNPs with or without the presence of NaCl, change

trend was also observed in a shift of Emax values and an aggregation
test with NaCl solution, confirming that the nanoconjugates
containing both C225 and gemcitabine (Gem-Au-C225) on a single
gold core are more stable than gold conjugates containing a single
agent (Au-C225 or Au-Gem; data not shown).

It is already reported that antibody has the ability to bind
covalently to AuNP due to the presence of thiols/amine groups
present within the amino acid residues (16, 37). Therefore, we
speculate that C225 also uses similar bonding mode with AuNP.
Quantitation of the amount of C225 and gemcitabine bound to
AuNP and their nature of bonding was further confirmed by TGA
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as discussed below.
Quantitation of C225 and gemcitabine in Au-C225-Gem
nanoconjugates. Figure 2A represents the TGA profile (left) and
derivative weight ratio (right) of Au-C225 and Au-C225-gem
nanoconjugates, respectively. Theoretically, the weight loss for
C225 should be 7% and 15% for gemcitabine (where 1 mL AuNP
solution containing 26 Ag of gold was incubated with 2 Ag of C225
and 5 Ag of gemcitabine). It is clear that a weight loss of 5% was
observed in the Au-C225 sample, whereas a weight loss of 8% was
observed for the Au-C225-Gem sample. In both cases, the
maximum desorption/decomposition took place at f300jC
(Fig. 2A). Therefore, the weight loss for gemcitabine in Au-C225gem was 3%. Hence, the TGA data confirmed that of the C225 and
gemcitabine initially used for the incubation, 71% of C225 and 20%
of gemcitabine, were attached to the AuNPs as Au-C225-Gem.
Similar conjugations were also observed in the case of Au-IgG-Gem
(isotype control of Au-C225-Gem). According to previous reports,
the resultant weight loss at f300jC is typical of Au-SH and
Au-NH2 covalent bonding energy (16, 33). However, in the case of
Au-C225-Gem, the desorption/decomposition maxima shifted to
f320jC, suggesting additional stabilization of the nanoconjugates

that needed a higher energy to desorb/decompose the antibodies/
drugs from the AuNP surface. The result obtained from TGA was
further confirmed by HPLC of the supernatant solution after
ultracentrifugation, revealing 80% of the gemcitabine initially used
to bind to AuNP was found in the supernatant.
Nature of bonding between C225 and gemcitabine with
AuNP: XPS analysis. The covalent bonding as suggested by the
TGA analysis was further confirmed by XPS shown in Fig. 2B to C.
Figure 2B (left) exhibits a single gold (Au 4f7/2) peak at 83.1 eV
with a spin orbit coupling of 3.7 eV in the drop-coated conjugates.
These data show that the Au+3 ions used in this process were
reduced to Au0 by NaBH4 (16, 17). Figure 2B (right) shows the
presence of three carbon peaks at 284.9, 287.3, and 290.3, and they
are sp3- (in saturated hydrocarbons such as in diamond) and sp2hybridized carbons (such as in C = C and C = O). Two weak sulfur
peaks were also observed. The presence of two sulfur peaks at
f162 and 166 eV represented two chemically distinct sulfur
species. However, the peaks were too weak to be curve fitted (data
not shown). We observed similar sulfur peaks from gold conjugates
containing the VEGF165 growth factor (32) as well gold conjugates
containing the monoclonal antibody to VEGF165 (anti-VEGF165;
ref. 16). According to previous reports, the peak at f162 eV can be
assigned to a gold-thiolate bond and peaks at a higher binding
energy to sulfones (16, 38). The nitrogen 1s peak at 399.6 eV
(Fig. 2C, left) is likely due to unionized, nonprotonated nitrogen
(32). This is in agreement with earlier studies reporting adsorption
of proteins/amino acids or amines on gold surfaces (39). It is also

Each fraction was diluted with an equal amount of
PBS, incubated at 37jC for a defined period of time,
and spun down by ultracentrifugation. The amount of

determined by 3H incorporation assay.

interesting to note that the contribution from the nitrogen 1s peak
observed in Au-C225-Gem is higher than that of Au-C225,
suggesting that this contribution may be from the gemcitabine
nitrogen (Fig. 2C, right). Furthermore, the nitrogen peak in AuC225-Gem was shifted to a slightly higher energy, suggesting a
covalent bonding of the gemcitabine nitrogen to AuNPs that
shifted the N 1s core level peak to a higher binding energy (similar
observations were made from TGA as well).
Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine nucleoside and, hence, a weak
nucleophile. Therefore, the bonding between gemcitabine and
AuNPs are expected to be weaker. However, the TGA data and XPS
studies show that gemcitabine binds to AuNPs fairly strongly
(desorption temperature, f320jC), suggestive of a covalent bond.
Stability studies in 140 mmol/L NaCl also suggest a similar mode of
bonding. Furthermore, the nature of bonding between DNA bases
and nucleosides on gold are well-reported in the literature (40).
Recently, it has been described that the (C-NH2) part of the adenine
molecule changes configuration from planar (sp2) to nonplanar
(sp3) upon coordination to metals, suggesting a covalent bonding

www.aacrjournals.org

between DNA bases and nucleosides on gold (40). In brief, stability
experiments, TGA, and XPS analysis as well as reports in the
literature suggest the covalent nature of bonding between gold and
C225 and between gold and gemcitabine.
In vitro targeting of Au-C225 to pancreatic cancer cells with
variable EGFR expression. Before testing the nanoconjugate for
the functional activity of individual component, it is important to
determine the targeting efficacy of the nanoconjugate. To validate
the efficacy of C225 as a targeting agent and viability of EGFR as a
target, we determined the EGFR expression levels in three different
pancreatic cancer cell lines, namely AsPC-1, PANC-1, and MIA
Paca2 by Western blot analysis. If EGFR is a viable target, it is
expected that cells with highest EGFR levels will uptake maximum
amount of Au-C225 compared with the one with lower expression.
The uptake of Au-C225 can be quantified in terms of gold using
ICP. The Western blot analysis clearly shows that AsPC-1 and
PANC-1 express higher levels of EGFR than MIA Paca2 cells
(Fig. 3A). To check the viability of EGFR as a target, all the cells
were treated with the purified conjugates for 2 hours (described in

Targeted Delivery of Gemcitabine Inhibits Tumor Growth

Materials and Methods). An optical picture of all the different cells
after treatment with Au-C225 and its isotype control Au-IgG is
shown in the Fig. 3B. The figure shows that all the cells efficiently
uptake Au-C225 as evidenced by the deep blue color of the cellpellet, whereas Au-IgG was minimally taken up. Uptake was
further quantified by ICP analysis. ICP analysis showed that cells
with higher EGFR expression internalized maximum Au-C225,
whereas cells with lowest expression had minimal uptake
(Fig. 3C), demonstrating that EGFR could be an efficient target,
at least in vitro, for cell specific delivery of nanoparticles or drug/
antibodies. This is further supported by TEM analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). It is also interesting to note here that PANC-1
and MIA Paca-2 showed better specificity of targeting compared
with AsPC-1, although it has high EGFR expression. This may be
due to the fact that both PANC-1 and MIA Paca-2 are primary cell
lines, whereas AsPC-1 is a metastatic cell line. Therefore, to test
the efficacy of the targeted delivery system in a metastatic model,
we used AsPC-1 in our in vivo studies as it generates the most
aggressive form of tumor when implanted orthotopically that
mimics the human situation. To further confirm the internalization of Au-C225 and its location, we performed TEM analysis of
Au-C225– and Au-IgG–treated AsPC-1 cells, respectively. Efficient
internalization of Au-C225 was seen in TEM, whereas Au-IgG was
only marginally taken up by the cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). We
found similar cellular uptake of Au-C225-Gem by these cells.
Therefore, all of the experiments discussed above clearly suggest
that gold nanoconjugates containing C225 could be an efficient
vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs to a pancreatic tumor in a
targeted fashion.
In vitro release profile of gemcitabine from Au-C225-Gem.
To successfully deliver the nanoconjugate in vivo, the nanoconjugate needs to be stable enough to reach the desired target
before any dissociation. Therefore, it is extremely important to
study the release profile of gemcitabine from Au-C225-Gem under
physiologic conditions. The release profile of gemcitabine in the
conjugate was tested in normal PBS at a physiologic pH of 7.4. The
Au-C225-Gem was obtained by ultracentrifugation and divided into
several equal fractions. Each fraction was diluted with equal
amount of PBS and incubated at 37jC for a defined time period
(described in Materials and Methods) followed by ultracentrifugation. The amount of gemcitabine released over time into the
supernatant was measured by HPLC. Figure 4A describes the
in vitro release profiles of gemcitabine from Au-C225-Gem
nanoconjugate, demonstrating that only 30% to 40% of AuNPbound gemcitabine was released after a 6-hour incubation period,
and f45% was released from the nanocomposite over a period of
24 hours. These results suggest sufficient stability of the nanoconjugates in a physiologic salt concentration.
In vitro functional efficacy of Au-C225-Gem. Before in vivo
studies are performed, it is important to show the functional
activity of gemcitabine in Au-C225-Gem and whether the in vitro
targeted delivery of gemcitabine results in enhanced inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation. In Fig. 4B, significant inhibition of AsPC-1
proliferation was observed with Au-C225-Gem compared with its
nontargeted counterpart, Au-IgG-Gem or single-agent alone (Gem
only or C225 only), or an equimolar mixture of the agents (Gem +
C225). A dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation was observed
in all the groups with maximum inhibition with Au-C225gemcitabine. Au-IgG-Gem also inhibited significantly when compared with an equimolar mixture of C225 and gemcitabine,
suggesting that conjugation to AuNP increases the efficacy of

gemcitabine when tested in a closed cell culture system. It is also
important to note that neither Au-C225 nor Au-IgG had any effect
on the proliferation of AsPC-1 cells (data not shown).
EGFR-mediated targeting of gold nanoconjugates in vivo.
After elucidating the in vitro efficacy of the nanoconjugates, we
wanted to determine whether C225 could efficiently deliver AuC225-Gem to the tumor in vivo. To test the efficacy of the targeted
delivery system in a metastatic model, we used AsPC-1 in our
in vivo studies as it generates the most aggressive form of tumor
when implanted orthotopically that mimics the human situation.
Generation of the orthotopic tumor model of pancreatic cancer
using AsPC-1 cells and treatment schedule is described in Materials
and Methods. Biodistribution of gold in different tissues was
performed using ICP, and results were shown in Fig. 5A. C225 could
efficiently home Au-C225-Gem to the tumor as evidenced by the
gold content detected among the various treatment groups.
Furthermore, the presence of gemcitabine did not interfere with
the targeting ability of C225 as there was no significant difference
in the gold content of tumors in the Au-C225 group and Au-C225Gem group. The gold uptake in the kidney and liver was also
minimal. These data conclusively prove that efficient in vivo
delivery of gold nanoconjugates to a pancreatic tumor could be
achieved by using the anti-EGFR antibody as a targeting agent.
Therapeutic efficacy of the nanoconjugates in vivo. After
demonstrating the ability of C225 to target EGFR-expressing cells
both in vitro and in vivo, we wanted to investigate if the same
nanoconjugates could inhibit tumor growth in vivo . After
orthotopically implanting AsPC-1/luciferase tumor cells in the
pancreas, mice were noninvasively imaged for luciferase bioluminescence using the Xenogen instrument (described in Materials
and Methods) to check for tumor growth and randomized
thereafter before the initiation of the treatment. Figure 5B and C
represented the luciferase imaging of the control group (C225 +
Gem) and experimental group (Au-C225-Gem), respectively, at the
end of the study. These figures clearly show significant tumor
growth inhibition in mice treated with Au-C225-Gem compared
with its nontargeted counterpart. These results were further
confirmed by measuring the tumor growth after sacrificing the
mice at the end of the experiment and assessing the tumor
volumes. Figure 5D (left) clearly shows that Au-C225-Gem inhibited
tumor growth significantly (f80%) compared with all other
nontargeted groups.
It was previously reported that in orthotopic pancreatic tumor
model, a dose of 250 mg/kg of gemcitabine resulted in a 58%
inhibition of tumor growth, and a dose of 7.5 mg/kg did not inhibit
tumor growth significantly (41). It is important to stress that we
used a much lower dose (2 mg/kg) of the drug than previously used
in preclinical studies. We reasoned that if the drug was successfully
delivered in a targeted fashion, we should see growth inhibition at
a lower dose, and this was shown in our experiment. Furthermore,
the absence of any inhibition in the gemcitabine only group is
probably due to this low dose. It is also important to note that
neither the combination group (C225 + Gem) nor the Au-C225
group inhibited tumor growth significantly, possibly due to the low
dose of the drug. We also did not see significant effect with Au-IgGGem group probably due to lack of targeting of the nanoconjugate
(data not shown).
Pharmacokinetics of Au-C225-Gem. Inhibition of tumor
growth with such a low dose of gemcitabine is very significant
and will have strong implications in cancer treatment where
toxicity is a major concern. To test whether the efficacy observed at

a lower dose is due to increased retention of gemcitabine in the
circulation upon nanoconjugation, we checked the clearance of AuC225-Gem from circulation in terms of gold concentration with
pharmacokinetic experiments. If gemcitabine were retained in the
circulation as gold nanoconjugates, we would expect enhanced
retention of gold in the circulation. Mean gold concentration data
were fit to a two-compartment open model using the program
Winnonlin, version 4.1 (Pharsight Corp.) weighted by the inverse
of the concentration squared. Biexponential decline in the gold
plasma concentration was observed with an initial distribution
half-life of 5.63 minute and a terminal elimination half-life of
41.8 minute (Fig. 5D, right). We also did not observe any increased
gemcitabine retention upon nanoconjugation when compared with
free gemcitabine (data not shown). These findings prove that the
efficacy observed at a lower dose is due to targeted delivery and
not due to increased retention upon nanoconjugation.
Targeted delivery of anticancer drugs specifically to the tumor
site is an important area of research in cancer therapeutics. Tumorspecific delivery of anticancer drugs will maximize the efficacy of
the drug and minimize collateral damage and, hence, reduce
systemic toxicity. In this article, we have shown the fabrication of

gold nanoconjugates containing a targeting agent and a cytotoxic
drug. It is important to note that targeted delivery is not only
dependent on EGFR expression but also on the mechanism of
receptor endocytosis and dynamics. A clear correlation of EGFR
expression with gold uptake is observed in primary pancreatic
cancer cell lines (high in PANC-1 and low in MIA Paca-2), whereas
gold uptake is low in metastatic AsPC-1 cell line, although it
expresses similar levels of EGFR as PANC-1. More importantly, we
have shown that the nanoconjugates containing gemcitabine and
C225 can specifically reach the metastatic tumor cells both in vitro
and in vivo with enhanced efficacy. Future technological advantages associated with AuNPs may be used in cancer therapeutics.
