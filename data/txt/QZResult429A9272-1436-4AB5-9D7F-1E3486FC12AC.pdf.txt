ABSTRACT
MRP1 transporter correlates positively with glioma malignancy and the Multiple
Drug Resistance (MDR) phenotype in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Evidence
shows that the MRP1 transporter is controlled by the adenosine signalling axis.
The aim of this study was to identify the role of adenosine on the MDR phenotype
in Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells (GSCs), the cell population responsible for the
tumorigenic and chemoresistance capabilities of this tumour. We found that GSCs
have increased intrinsic capacity to generate extracellular adenosine, thus controlling
MRP1 transporter expression and activity via activation of the adenosine A3 receptor
(A3AR). We showed PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways downstream
A3AR to control MRP1 in GSCs. In vitro pharmacological blockade of A3AR had a
chemosensitizing effect, enhancing the actions of antitumour drugs and decreasing
cell viability and proliferation of GSCs. In addition, we produced an in vivo xenograft
model by subcutaneous inoculation of human GSCs in NOD/SCID-IL2Rg null mice.
Pharmacological blockade of A3AR generated a chemosensitizing effect, enhancing
the effectiveness of the MRP1 transporter substrate, vincristine, reducing tumour size
and the levels of CD44 and Nestin stem cell markers as well as the Ki-67 proliferation
indicator. In conclusion, we demonstrated the chemosensitizing effect of A3AR
blockade on GSCs.

INTRODUCTION

However, since it is a highly infiltrative tumour, cancer
cells often invade healthy brain tissue and evade surgical
resection which inevitably leads to early reoccurrence
[5]. In addition, the intrinsic properties of tumour cell
populations produce poor outcomes in almost all evaluated
therapeutic alternatives.
A key features of GBM is its high chemoresistance
to a broad spectrum of antitumor drugs, a phenomenon
known as Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR) [6].
Acquisition of the MDR phenotype correlates with
overexpression of members from the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily [7]. These

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), classified as a
grade IV astrocytoma by the World Health Organization
(WHO), is considered the most common and aggressive
tumour of the Central Nervous System (CNS) [1, 2].
Standard management for GBM patients involves surgical
resection of the tumour, followed by radiation and
chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) which results
in a survival rate up to 15 months [3]. Anti-angiogenic
agents, and more recently immunotherapeutic approaches,
are being developed to improve GBM prognostics [3, 4].

RESULTS

transporters are efflux pumps that translocate a wide
range of substrates, such as lipophilic and xenobiotic
molecules, to the extracellular environment using
energy from ATP hydrolysis [7]. Analyses of biopsies
and GBM cell lines, T98G and G44, revealed that the
Multiple drug Resistance-associated Protein-1 (MRP1)
is the predominant ABC transporter in GBM, compared
to other transporters with roles in other types of cancer
such as ABCG2 (also known as BCRP or Breast Cancer
Resistance Protein) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [8].
Inhibition of MRP1 activity increases cell sensitivity to
cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of antineoplastic
drugs such as vincristine, etoposide and taxol [8],
representing a possible therapeutic target to control GBM
reoccurrence.
GBM
shows
remarkable
intratumour
heterogeneity and cell hierarchy, not only at the
morphological level but also in regards to cell
differentiation status [9, 10]. Within the tumour a cell
subpopulation called Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells
(GSCs), which share some intrinsic properties with
normal stem cells, such as self-renewal, proliferation
and multi lineage differentiation [11, 12], are more
resistant to radiation and chemotherapy than normal
progenitor cells and differentiated tumour cells [12,
13]. This cell subpopulation gives rise to the tumour
mass and cell heterogeneity and is therefore may
be  responsible for GBM reoccurrence following the
use of chemotherapeutic agents [14, 15]. However, the
mechanisms that induce the MDR phenotype remain
practically unexplored. Some studies have detected
expression of MDR transporters, particularly MRP1,
MRP3, ABCG2 and P-gp in GBM [16–19]. Jin and col.,
observed a significant increase in MRP1 expression
levels after exposition to etoposide, suggesting that this
ABC transporter induces an adaptive response [20].
Inhibition of MRP1 extrusion activity is of clinical
relevance in counteracting GSCs mediated reoccurrence.
Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that control this
transporter has become a hot topic. We have previously
identified a relationship between expression and activity
levels of ecto-5ʹ-nucleotidase (CD73), an enzyme that
catalyses AMP dephosphorylation to adenosine, with the
MDR phenotype in glioblastoma cells [5]. This suggests
a link between intratumour environment and MDR
phenotype also exists. Adenosine is increased in tumour
hypoxic medium [21] and its signalling through P1 receptor
family members may mediate important responses that
enable tumour growth. Indeed, it is well known that
adenosine mediates tumour immunosuppression [22]. The
aim of this work was to study the effects of adenosine
on the MDR phenotype in GSCs. We also explored
pharmacological intervention of adenosine receptor
signalling to chemosensitize GSCs to conventional anticancer agents.

Glioblastoma stem-like cells have an intrinsically
increased capability to generate extracellular
adenosine
When maintained in serum-free neurobasal medium,
human GBM Primary Culture (PC) cells and the human
U87MG cell line were capable of forming non-adherent
cell clusters or neurospheres, a cell subpopulation
enriched in Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells (GSCs)
(Supplementary Figure S1). Immunocytochemistry
staining of GSCs derived from U87MG and PC cells
showed expression of Stem Cell markers CD44 and
Nestin (Supplementary Figure S1A). When GSCs
of the GBM PC and U87MG cell line were cultured
in differentiating medium containing foetal bovine
serum they grew as an adherent monolayer culture and
expressed differentiation markers of neuronal and glial
cell, TUBB3 and GFAP, respectively (Supplementary
Figure S1A). PC and U87MG neurospheres had a high
percentage of cells positive for Stem Cell markers (Nestin
and CD133), compared to adherent cells (Supplementary
Figure S1B), analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, we
also observed a higher mRNA expression level of Stem
Cell markers (CD44, Nestin and CD133) in neurospheres
than adherent U87MG cells (Supplementary Figure S1C).
After U87GM-neurospheres were exposed to medium
containing serum for 5 days we measured the kinetics
of Stem Cells markers (Nestin, CD133 and CD44) and
found that these markers disappeared in a time-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure S1D). In contrast,
differentiation markers (TUBB3 and GFAP) increased
their expression under these conditions (Supplementary
Figure S1D). These results demonstrate the stemness
abilities of our GSCs in neurosphere cultures derived from
U87MG and PC cells.
The Multiple Drugs Resistant (MDR) phenotype
has been linked to purinergic signalling in adherent
population cells (also called differentiated cells) from
glioblastoma [5]; however, the role of adenosine signalling
in GSCs has not been explored. Our first approach was to
quantify extracellular levels of the adenosine nucleoside
in glioblastoma cells. We found a ten-fold y a thirteenfold increase of extracellular adenosine in U87MG and
PC GSCs respectively, compared to their differentiated
cells (Figure 1A). AMPase activity was also higher in
U87MG and PC GSCs compared to differentiated cells
(Figure 1B), suggesting that purinergic signalling is
essential to GSCs physiology. We previously observed
5ʹ-ectonucleotidase (CD73) and adenosine A3 receptor
subtype (A3AR) overexpression in GBM specimens
compared to peritumoral tissues [5], but cell type specific
distribution has not been evaluated. Via flow cytometry
we observed that A3AR was present in more than 90%
of GSCs (Figure 1C); similarly, receptor protein content
67374

was higher in U87MG and PC GSCs compared to their
adherent cells (Figure 1D).

Likewise, the percentage of MRP1 transporter positive
cells was greater in GSCs than adherent cells (Figure 2C).
This correlates with increased AMPase activity and
A3AR expression levels in these cells, suggesting a link
between purinergic signalling and MDR mediated by
MRP1. We evaluated the effect of AOPCP (a competitive
inhibitor of CD73) and MRS1220 (a selective A3AR
antagonist) on MRP1 expression. Using flow cytometry,
we observed that the porcentage of adherent cells and
GSCs from the U87MG cell line and PC cells containing
MRP1 was decreased with both treatments, observing a
greater decrease with MRS1220 (Figure 2C). Similarly,
through Western Blot analysis we observed that the

The adenosine A3 receptor increases MRP1
transporter expression and activity in GSCs
In agreement with previous studies on
chemoresistance in GBM specimens [5, 8, 23], the
Multiple drug Resistance Protein-1 (MRP1) was detected
in adherent cells; however in the present study we found
that MRP1 protein and mRNA content was greater in
GSCs than adherent cells of the U87MG cell line and
PC cells (Figure 2A and 2B; Supplementary Figure S2).

treatments also decreased MRP1 protein expression in
adherent cells and GSCs of U87MG cells with a more
exaggerated effect observed in treatment with MRS1220,
obtaining a loss of over 45% of transporter expression
in GSCs (Figure 2D). In turn, we presume that these
treatments would have an effect on cell chemoresistance
potential. To study extrusion activity mediated by
MRP1, we assessed intracellular accumulation of
Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate (CFDA) in loaded cells
[24]. We found that extrusion of CFDA decreased in
adherent cells and GSCs upon treatment with AOPCP and
MRS1220, denoted by intracellular accumulation of the
fluorescent tracer in U87MG (Figure 2E) and PC cells
(Figure 2F). This supports the essential role of A3AR in
decreasing MRP1 transporter expression and activity. To
validate the observed effects of A3AR pharmacological
inhibition we also evaluated the consequence of
eliminating receptor expression in U87MG cells
(U87MGKO).
A3AR expression was completely abolished using
the CRISPR/Cas9 system in U87MG cells (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure S3). Once characterized, U87MG
wild type (U87MGWT) and U87MGKO cells were cultured
to generate GSCs, and then their stemness abilities and
MRP1 protein content/activity were evaluated. GSCs
lacking A3AR exhibited common properties of Cancer
Stem Cells forming neurospheres clusters expressing
the Stem Cells markers (CD44, CD133 and Nestin)
(Supplementary Figure S4). In GSCs of U87MGKO total
MRP1 content was decreased (Figure 3A) and only half
of the cells contained MRP1 (Figure 3B) compared
to U87MGWT GSCs. Consequently, intracellular
accumulation of CFDA was higher in GSCs derived from
U87MGKO due to a lower extrusion activity mediated by
MRP1 (Figure 3C). We conclude that A3AR signalling
increases MRP1 expression and activity maintenance of
MRP1 in GSCs derived from the U87MG cell line and that
this receptor arises as a pharmacological target to revert
the MDR phenotype in GSCs.

or PD98059 (Figure 4B) for 24 hours. However, this effect
was more prominent with LY294002, decreasing MRP1
expression to similar levels as treatment with MRS1220
(Figure 2D). To discover if the decreased MRP1 expression
observed with LY294002 or PD98059 is induced by A3AR
signalling, we incubated U87MG GSCs with MRS1220
for 24 hours and analysed the phosphorylation state of Akt
(Figure 4A) and ERK1/2 (Figure 4B). Our results indicate
that p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 expression are decreased when
antagonizing A3AR (Figure 4). Therefore, A3AR activates
both signalling pathways, directly affecting MRP1
expression in U87MG GSCs.

Pharmacological blockade of A3AR has a
chemosensitizing effect on GSCs by enhancing
antitumor drug actions
Further analyses in U87MGKO GSCs showed
that these cells were more vulnerable to the antitumor
drug vincristine, a substrate to be extruded through
MRP1. Over 50% of cell viability was affected by
vincristine in U87MGKO GSCs compared to only ~20% in
U87MGWT GSCs under the same treatment (Figure 3D).
Pharmacological intervention of the MDR phenotype
using an A3AR antagonist was also evaluated in vitro.
The A3AR antagonist alone only slightly affected cell
viability in GSCs, meanwhile MRS1220 enhanced
vincristine´s potential to decrease cell viability in U87MG
(Figure 5A) and PC cells (Figure 5B). Moreover, the
effect of LY294002 and PD98059 on the viability of
U87MG (Figure 5A) and PC (Figure 5B) GSCs was
evaluated. We determined that both inhibitors potentiate
the effect of vincristine, being higher with LY294002
(Figure 5A and 5B). On the other hand, in adherent cells
vincristine decreased cell viability when combined with
MRS1220, LY294002 or PD98059 (Figure 5A and 5B).
Similar effects were observed on cell proliferation, where
vincristine had an antiproliferative effect on adherent cells
and GSCs when used together with APOCP or MRS1220
(Figure 5C).

A3AR increases MRP1 transporter expression
through the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2
signalling pathways

Pharmacological blockage of A3AR has an in vivo
chemosensitizing effect on GSCs

Previous studies demonstrated that MRP1 transporter
expression and/or activity is controlled by the PI3K/Akt and
MEK/ERK1/2 signalling pathways in different tumour and
CSC cell lines [25–28]. Therefore, we evaluated if A3AR
uses these signalling pathways to regulate MRP1 in U87MG
GSCs. Previously we investigated the Stemness abilities of
GSCs under MRS1220, LY294002 and PD98059 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S5). These treatments did not affect
the neurosphere formation and stem cell markers expression
(CD44 and CD133) (Supplementary Figure S5). We found
that MRP1 expression was significantly decreased when
U87MG GSCs were incubated with LY294002 (Figure 4A)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We standardized an in vivo xenograft model to
evaluate the effect of MRS1220 on tumours from human
U87MG derived GSCs. NOD/SCID-IL2Rγnull mice
subcutaneously inoculated with U87MG GSCs formed
a visible tumour at day 7 post-inoculation. Following
tumour formation mice were treated with vincristine or
MRS1220 alone or in combination. Tumour size was
measured every 2 days (Figure 6A). Mice were euthanized
following seventeen days of treatment and tumours
were removed for histopathological analysis. Animals
treated with MRS1220 alone presented a slight change
in tumour growth, but this was not statistically different

to vehicle treated mice. Groups treated with vincristine
exhibited decreased tumour growth compared to vehicle
treated mice; moreover MRS1220 notably enhanced
the effect of vincristine on tumour volume (Figure 6A).
Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that MRP1
staining was decreased in tumour samples from mice
treated with MRS1220 (–0.25 fold), however vincristine
alone increased staining (2.23 fold) (Figure 6B and 6C).
Stem cells markers CD44 and Nestin were decreased
in tumour samples from mice treated with vincristine
combined with MRS1220, compared to the vehicle group
(Figure 6B and 6C). Similar effects were observed with
apoptotic markers. We observed that Bcl-2 expession
(anti-apoptotic factor) decreased in tumours treated with
MRS1220-Vc (17% less) and on the other hand vincristine
alone increased Bcl-2 expression (Figure 6B and 6C). On
the contrary, tumours from animals treated with vincristine

and MRS1220-Vc presented increased Bad protein
content, 19 fold and 51 fold, respectively (Figure 6B and
6C), however this effect was not observed with MRS1220
alone (Figure 6B and 6C). Finally, immunodetection of
Ki-67/MKI67 (cellular proliferation marker) decreased in
the tumours of mice treated with MRS1220 (50% less)
and MRS1220-Vc (53% less), but not in the group treated
with vincristine alone (1.42 fold) (Figure 6B and  6C).
These results indicate that MRS1220 has a probed
chemosensitizing effect on the anticancer drug vincristine
affecting GSCs cells, responsible for giving rise to the
tumour.

in vivo tumour model shows that treatment with vincristine
increases MRP1 content in tumour tissues [20]. Similar
effects were observed in human samples of patients
with GBM after treatment with vincristine [31]. Clinical
phase studies using vincristine and etoposide, without a
chemosensitizer, have not produced impact on patient
survival, which reinforces the key function of MRP1
in GBM and supports the potential therapeutic use of
chemosensitizers.
Endogenous regulation of MRP1 by adenosine in
GSCs and the increased capacity of these cells to produce
this nucleoside are new research topics. It was recently
described that metabolic adaptations in GSCs can provide
higher glycolytic and ATP production capacity [32, 33].
This could be a result of a higher potential to liberate ATP
to the extracellular space where adenosine metabolism
occurs. The microenvironment of glioblastoma cells may
also contribute to increased extracellular adenosine. Low
oxygen levels in the innermost areas of the tumour and
cell damage caused by inflammatory processes, are two

GBM treatment, since they have tumorigenic capacity and
are responsible for mediating relapse. Treatment success
depends on the potential of GSCs to evade chemotherapy
[19, 29]. The mechanisms that control MDR in these
cells and their regulation are poorly understood. Our
contribution in this work was to identify endogenous
regulation mechanisms of MDR mediated by MRP1 in
GSCs. We also demonstrated that chemosensitization of
these cells interferes with A3AR signalling, which could
be useful in early control of tumour reocurrence.
Studies in GBM demonstrate a correlation between
MRP1 expression levels and a poor prognostic. MRP3
expression is associated to a low survival rate [30],
however, many studies show that inhibition of MRP1
activity is sufficient to chemosensitize GBM cells to
antitumoural agents that are substrates of this transporter,
such as vincristine and etoposide [5, 8, 20]. GBM cells
intrinsically respond to these antitumoural agents with
an apparent increase in MRP1 expression. In addition to
in vitro studies by Jin et al. (2010), our evidence from an

factors closely related to the increase of this nucleoside.
The increased production of adenosine observed in
adherent PC and PC GSCs in relation to GSCs derived
from U87MG, could in fact, be the result of their response
and adaptation to the tumour microenvironment. The
limiting step of this pathway is AMPase activity, which
was increased in GSCs compared to differentiated
adherent cells. 5ʹ-ectonucleotidase CD73 is abundant in

GBM specimens, however, prostatic acid phosphatase
(PAP) is present in GSCs [34]. Even though AMPase
activity has not been a focus of our study, these results
could explain the small inhibitory response of the CD73
inhibitor (AOPCP) on MRP1 activity, compared to the
effect obtained by the A3AR antagonist, probably due to
the existence of additional AMPase activity mediated by
PAP. Therefore, the use of an A3AR antagonist is a more

suitable therapeutic target for the inhibition of ligand
production.
Under certain pathological conditions, such as
hypoxia, adenosine levels can considerably increase in
the extracellular fluid to the micromole range, which
permits activation of low affinity adenosine receptor
subtypes A2BAR y A3AR [35]. Therefore, signalling
through these receptors has been associated to malignant
and aggressive phenotypes in various types of cancers,
such as breast cancer [36–38]. Abundance of the A3AR
subtype has been previously reported in glioma cells
[5, 39], and its activation produced pro-angiogenic effects
during VEGF production and proliferation. Our in vivo
results show that treatment with the A3AR antagonist
decreases tumour growth. This could be explained by a
possible effect of MRS1220 on GSCs and differentiated
cell proliferation, as occurs in vitro with U87MG cells.
Similar results were obtained in C6 and U138MG glioma
cells, where inhibition of adenosine production reduced cell
proliferation by 30% [40]. Adenosine signalling is linked to
maintenance of the GSCs chemoresistant phenotype. Thus
the use of MRS1220 or A3AR knockout sensitizes GSCs to
vincristine, inhibiting tumoural growth of GSCs implanted
into immunocompromised mice. Therefore, downstream
intracellular signalling molecules of this adenosine
receptor control MRP1 activity. Some studies reported
that inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathway
affect MRP1 mediated chemoresistance in cancer cells
[27, 28]. Wortmannin discovered decreased phosphorylated
Akt levels in myelogenous leukaemia cells, resulting in
downregulation of MRP1 and decreased rho123 extrusion
[25]. Also, inhibition of PI3K activity chemosensitized
prostate cancer cells and MRP1 expression was inversely
increased by PI3K activation in these cells [26]. Molecular
and signaling profiles from glioblastoma specimens has
permitted classification of these proneural, mesenchymal
and proliferative tumour subtypes [41], with the latter being
subdivided into classic and neural [42]. Akt signalling is
activated in proliferative and mesenchymal subtypes,
suggesting that they have higher chemoresistant potential
induced by MRP1. In cancer stem cells less is known
about the A3AR/PI3K/Akt axis. On the other hand, MEK
inhibition in hepatocellular carcinoma decreases MRP1
and MRP3 transporter expression [28], indicating that
activation of this pathway is involved in chemoresistance
of pancreatic cancer cells [43]. Our contribution was to
demonstrate that interception of the adenosine signalling
axis can affect Akt and ERK1/2 activation and therefore
decrease MRP1 expression in GSCs.

and Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Oriente. Samples
were processed for primary cultures as previously
described [16, 23].

Cell line and primary cultures
The human GBM U87MG cell line was acquired
from the American Type Culture Collection Company
(ATCC® HTB-14™). Cells were grown in DMEM-F12
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, all
purchased from Life Technologies. Cells were incubated
in standard conditions at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2. For preparation of GBM Primary Cultures
(PC) [16, 23] the resected tissues were washed twice
with HBSS-1× antibiotic-antimitotic (Life Technologies)
in aseptic conditions. After removing visible blood
vessels and necrotic tissues, glioblastoma samples were
centrifuged (600 g by 5 min) and the sediment was
incubated by 30 min with 6 mg/mL of collagenase type
I (Gibco®) at 37ºC in a shaker platform. The digested
tissue was filter through a nylon membrane (40 µm) and
centrifuged (600 g by 5 min). Sediment was resuspended
in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine
serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere and 5%
CO2. To form neurospheres (GSCs) cells were grown in
Neurobasal medium (Gibco®) supplemented with EGF
(20  ng/mL), bFGF (20  ng/mL), LIF (10  ng/mL), 1  ×
B27 (w/o vitamin A) and 100 units/mL of penicillin/
streptomycin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunocytochemistry

Pharmacological agents

Adherent human Primary Cultures (PC) and
U87MG cell lines were grown on circular coverslips at
semi-confluence, and GSCs neurospheres were adhered to

coverslips using Poly-L-Lysine Cell Attachment Protocol
[45]. Later both kinds of cells were washed with 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), fixed with paraformaldehyde
3.7% and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in
1 × PBS. Preparations were blocked with 1% BSA and
incubated with anti-CD44 (ab51037, abcam), anti-Nestin
(ab22035, abcam), anti-GFAP (sc-33673, Santa Cruz), and
anti-TUBB3 (SAB4700544, Sigma Aldrich) antibodies.
For Immunocytochemistry the ImmPRESS HRP Universal
Antibody Polymer Detection Kit (Vector Laboratories)
and Liquid DAB+Substrate Chromogen System (K3468,
DAKO) were used. Finally, hematoxylin staining was used
as a counter stain and cells were visualized using a light
microscope (Zeiss).

Cruz), anti-A3AR (sc-13938, Santa Cruz), anti-Nestin
(sc-23927, Santa Cruz), and anti-CD133 (130-092-395,
Miltenyi Biotec) antibodies at 4°C overnight and were
detected by flow cytometry using their respective Alexa
fluor 488 antibody (Life Technology) through the FL1
filter (530/30 nm) of the cytometer.

RT-qPCR
We used an RT-qPCR assay, with the ΔΔCt method
and ACTB as a normalizer gene, to evaluate mRNA
expression of Stem cell markers (CD44, Nestin and
CD133) and MRP1 in PC and U87MG cell line. Reverse
transcription was performed with 1 µg of RNA using the
tetro cDNA Synthesis kit (Bioline®). The qPCR reaction
was performed in a final volume of 20 µL with 250 nM
of each primer using the 5× HOT FIREPol® EvaGreen®
qPCR Mix Plus (ROX) kit (Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia)
following the manufacturer›s instructions. Briefly, HOT
FIREPol® DNA Polymerase was activated by a 15 min
incubation step at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation (95°C by 15 sec), annealing (60°C by 20 sec)
and elongation (72°C by 20 sec). Finally, a dissociation
curve was assayed to distinguish specific amplicons. All
qPCRs were conducted in triplicate for each treatment.
GraphPad Prism® 6.01 software was used to graph
the results and calculate statistics. P value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The list of primers used
in this study was added to the supplementary information
Table Supplementary S1.

Protein extracts and Western blots
Total protein extracts of differentiated cells (called
adherent cells or Adh) and GSCs from the U87MG cell
line were obtained by lysis with 150 μL extraction buffer
(63.5 mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 10% glicerol, 2% SDS,
1 mM PMSF, 2 mM aprotinin, 1 mg/mL leupeptin and
pepstatin). Samples were sonicated three times for 5
sec and centrifuged at 12.000 g for 15 min, then protein
concentration was quantified using Bicinchoninic Acid
(BCA) Protein Assay (BioRad). For Western blots,
50 µg of protein extract was fractionated by SDSPAGE and transferred to 0.22 μm PVDF membranes
(PERK1/2in–Elmer). Membranes were blocked in
1 × PBS/0.05%tween/1%BSA and incubated with antiCD44 (562991, BD Bioscience), anti-CD133 (130-092395, Miltenyi Biotec), anti-Nestin (sc-33677, Santa
Cruz), anti-GFAP (sc-33673, Santa Cruz), anti-TUBB3
(SAB4700544, Sigma Aldrich), anti-MRP1 (sc-18835,
Santa Cruz), anti-A3AR (sc-13938, Santa Cruz), antipAkt (S473, 9271, Cell Signalling), and anti-pERK1/2
(sc-7383, Santa Cruz) primary antibodies. A secondary
antibody-HRP conjugate was used for immunodetection
and was visualised using the ECL Western blotting
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Durham, NC). Finally images were captured
with the Syngene G:Box system (Synoptics Ltd) and were
quantified using a densitometry analysis with ImageJ
software (NIH). Each membrane was normalized to
β-actin (sc-47778 HRP, Santa Cruz) expression.

Adenosine quantification
Cells (Adherent cells and GSCs) from PC and
U87MG were incubated in 1 mL of Tyrode’s buffer for
1 h at 37°C. A volume of 200 µL of incubation medium
was mixed with 100 µl of citrate buffer at pH 6.0.
Adenosine, AMP, ADP and ATP contents were quantified
with 2-chloroacetaldehyde derivatizations by HPLC
fractionation in a Chromolith Performance RP-18 column
(Merck) and by fluorescent detection [46]. Quantification
procedures included adenosine (A9251), ATP (FLAAS),
ADP (A2754) and AMP (01930) standards all purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Concentration was normalized to the
total protein concentration in each test. For CD73 activity,
adherent cells and GSCs of PC and the U87MG cell line
(2 × 105) were exposed to AMP (400 nM) for 15 min in
Tyrode’s buffer at 37°C and at controlled oxygen levels.
The final adenosine content was quantified and normalized
as described above.

Flow cytometry analysis
Differentiated cells (adherent cells) and GSCs of
the U87MG cell line were evaluated by flow cytometry
(BD C6 Accuri and BD FACSJazz™, USA). Briefly,
1.0 × 106 cells were fixed with PFA 3.7% for 15 min at
room temperature and permeabilized with cold methanol
for 45 min at 4°C. Cells were then blocked for 45 min
with 1 × PBS-BSA 0.5% at room temperature. Lastly, the
cells were marked with the anti-MRP1 (sc-18835, Santa

MRP1 functional assays
For MRP1 functional assays we used the protocol
described by Garrido et al. (2011) [24]. Human PC
and U87MG adherent cells with their respective GSCs

(2  ×  105) were exposed to CD73 activity inhibitor
(AOPCP) or an A3AR antagonist (MRS1220) in serum
free medium DMEM/F-12 for 24 h at 37°C in 24-well
plates. They were then washed and loaded with 500 nM
of the fluorescent substrate CFDA for 15 min. Cells
were subsequently washed three times with 1  ×  PBS
and incubated for 15 min in serum-free DMEM/F-12
medium. Cells were then washed three times with icecold 1  ×  PBS and lysed in 1  ×  PBS containing 0.4%
Triton X-100. Fluorescence of cell extracts was measured
using a spectrofluorometer (PERK1/2in–Elmer), exciting
at 488  nm and collecting emission at 530 nm [47].
Accumulated fluorescence was corrected to the total
protein content of lysed cells.

(cpm) and normalized to the total protein content of each
culture well.

Generation of A3AR knockout GSCs
For the generation of a human U87MG A3AR
Knockout (U87MGKO) cells we used the CRISPRCas9 system [48]. The plasmidial vector contained the
Cas9 endonuclease and gRNA was purchased at Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (sc-402007). We generated stable
U87MGKO cells, by homology directed repair (HDR), that
were selected by the expression of RFP and puromycin
resistance (sc-4020078-HDR) [49]. To validate U87MGKO
cells we used western blot and flow cytometry. Finally,
these cells were cultured as GSCs and we then evaluated
expression (western blot and flow cytometry) and activity
(CFDA assay) of MRP1, and cell viability (MTT assay)
under the previously described treatment.

Cell viability assay
For cell viability assays the MTT protocol described
by Garrido et al. (2011) [24] was performed. A quantity
of 10 × 104 cells per well were cultured in 96-well plates
for 24 h and exposed to Vc (100 nM) or Et (2 µM) alone
or in combination with a CD73 inhibitor (AOPCP), A3AR
antagonist (MRS1220), PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or
a MAPK inhibitor (PD98059) for 24 h. Cells were then
incubated with 5 mg/ml MTT reagent (thiazole blue
tetrazolium) in culture medium for 1 h. Formazan crystals
were dissolved in 100 µl of DMSO. Some modifications
were made for the neurosphere MTT assay. Briefly,
GSCs after seven days of culture were seeded in 96-well
plates for 24 h using the treatment previously described.
GSCs were then incubated with MTT reagent (5 mg/ml)
for 4 h, formazan crystals were dissolved in MTT lysis
buffer (100 μl of 10% SDS, 45% dimethylformamide and
pH was adjusted to pH 4.5 with glacial acid) overnight
at 37°C. For both assays absorbance was measured at
550 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek
Instruments, Inc.). Absorbance values were expressed as
a percentage relative to control cells without treatment
(basal condition).

Animals and treatment
All animal studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use committee at the Universidad Austral
de Chile (Permit Number: 29–2011) according to the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
NOD/SCID-IL2Rγnull mice (No.005557; The Jackson
Laboratory©, USA) weighing 25 g were maintained
under standard laboratory conditions: 12 h light-dark
cycle (lights on from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.), with
food and water ad libitum. Human U87MG GSCs were
grown, collected and resuspended at 1 × 105 cells/200 µl
(DMEM/F12). Cells were inoculated by subcutaneous
injection at the left flank of mice previously anesthetized
via intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (100 mg/
kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg). 7 days post-inoculation, mice
were treated with vehicle (DMEM:F12-0.001% DMSO),
MRS1220 (0.05 mg/kg/day), Vincristine (Vc; 0.1 mg/
kg/days) or MRS1220-Vc for 10 days. Tumour growth
was measure daily and plotted (cm3). Following 10 days
of treatment mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal
administration of Sodium Thiopental (120 mg/kg).
Subcutaneous tumours were removed and fixed in 3.7%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany).

Cell proliferation assay
The proliferative response was evaluated in
human U87MG cell line by 3H-thymidine incorporation
assay [24]. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells per well were cultured
in 12-well plates and incubated with Vc (100 nM) and
Et (2 µM) alone or with CD73 inhibitor (AOPCP) or
A3AR antagonist (MRS1220) for 24 h. Then 0.5 µCi/
mL of 3H-thymidine per well was added for 24 h. After
incubation, cells were harvested and the resulting
trichloroacetic acid-insoluble materials were collected on
0.45 µm PVDF filters. Once dry, the filters were put into
plastic vials with 4 mL of liquid scintillation. Incorporated
radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter
(Packard). The results were plotted as counts per minute

Histopathology and immunohystochemistry
Tumour samples were processed at the Pathological
Anatomy Department of the Hospital Base of Valdivia,
where tumour samples were paraffin embedded and
5 µm sections were mounted on silanized slides.
Histological preparations were dewaxed with xylol and
rehydrated using alcohols in decreasing concentration.
For histopathology analysis samples were immersed in
haematoxylin for 5 min and washed preparations were
immersed with 0.1 M sodium borate (pH 8.5) for 30 sec

and eosin for 5 min. Finally, samples were passed through
another series of alcohols in ascending order from 70°
to 100° followed by xylol and mounted (Histomount,
Invitrogen). The preparations were visualized using a
light microscope (Zeiss). For immunodetection samples
were treated as described previously [43]. Briefly, samples
were dewaxed and hydrated using alcohols in decreasing
concentration, immersed in citrate buffer (pH 6) and
heated until boiling. 3% hydrogen peroxide was added to
the samples and washed with distilled water and 1 × PBS.
Preparations were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h and
incubated with anti-MRP1 (sc-18836; Santa Cruz), antiA3AR (sc-13938, Santa Cruz), anti-Ki67 (sc-15402; Santa
Cruz), for Stem Cells [anti-Nestin (ab22035, abcam), and
anti-CD44 (ab51037, abcam)] and apoptotic [anti-Bcl-2
(610538) and anti-Bad (610391) antibodies, all purchased
from BD Biosciences] markers. Immunodetections
were visualised using the ImmPRESS HRP Universal
Antibody Polymer Detection Kit (Vector Laboratories)
and Liquid DAB + Substrate Chromogen System (K3468,
DAKO) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
distribution of markers in the tissue was visualized using
a light microscope (Zeiss) and a representative region
of each condition (Control, Vincristine, MRS1220 and
MRS1220-Vincrsitine) was used to evaluate expression of
these markers. Finally, data were processed using ImageJ
software (NIH) and the GraphPad Prism® 6.01 software
was used to graph the results and statistics. Control
values without treatment were normalized and calibrated
to 100%. P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
