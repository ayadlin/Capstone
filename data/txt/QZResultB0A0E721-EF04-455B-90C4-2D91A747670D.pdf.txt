Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the
majority of which occur in the oral cavity, remain a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A major
limitation in HNSCC research has been the paucity of animal
models to test the validity of current genetic paradigms of
tumorigenesis and to explore the effectiveness of new
treatment modalities and chemopreventive strategies. Here,
we have developed an inducible oral-specific animal tumor
model system, which consists in the expression of a tamoxifeninducible Cre recombinase (CreERtam) under the control of
the cytokeratin 14 (K14) promoter (K14-CreERtam) and
mice in which the endogenous K-ras locus is targeted (LSLK-ras G12D), thereby causing the expression of endogenous
levels of oncogenic K-ras G12D following removal of a stop
element. Surprisingly, whereas K14-CreERtam can also target
the skin, K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D mice developed papillomas exclusively in the oral mucosa within 1 month after
tamoxifen treatment. These lesions were highly proliferative
but never progressed to carcinoma. However, when crossed
with p53 conditional knockout (p53 flox/flox) mice, mice
developed SCCs exclusively on the tongue as early as 2 weeks
after tamoxifen induction, concomitant with a remarkable
activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling pathway. The availability of this ras and p53 two-hit
animal model system recapitulating HNSCC progression may
provide a suitable platform for exploring novel molecular
targeted approaches for the treatment of this devastating
disease. Indeed, we show here that mTOR inhibition by the use
of rapamycin is sufficient to halt tumor progression in this
genetically defined oral cancer model system, thereby prolonging animal survival. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4159–66]

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the vast
majority of which occur in the oral cavity, remain a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (1), resulting in more
than 10,000 deaths each year in the United States alone (2). Like
most cancers, HNSCC progression involves the sequential acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor suppressor
genes and oncogenes (reviewed in ref. 3). The most frequent
alterations include loss of heterozygosity and promoter silencing of

the p16 and inactivating mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor
genes (3). HNSCC often overexpress the epidermal growth factor
receptor and some of its active variants (4) and harbor activating
mutations in the ras oncogene with a rate ranging from 3% to
5% in Western countries and up to 50% in India and Southeast
Asia (5–7).
Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
involved in HNSCC have been hampered by the limited
availability of appropriate animal models for oral malignancies.
In this regard, genetically engineered mouse models are powerful
tools to investigate specific cause and effect relationships between
molecular changes and cancer development and progression (8).
However, the use of genetically defined approaches for HNSCC
has been limited due to the lack of specific systems targeting
the oral stratified epithelium. For example, expression of the
K-ras oncogene in the oral epithelium under the control of a
cytokeratin 5 (K5) promoter-driven tet-on inducible system leads
to SCC in the oral mucosa and the salivary glands, skin, and other
squamous epithelia (9, 10). A K5 promoter-driven Cre recombinase system that is activated by the local administration of a
synthetic progesterone derivative has been used to express a
mutant K-ras allele in the oral epithelium of mice, leading to
the development of oral benign papillomas (11). These mice
develop massive oral carcinomas when crossed with animals
lacking transforming growth factor receptor II (TGFhRII);
therefore, they are no longer responsive to the growth-suppressive
activity of TGFh (7). In these conditional TGFhRII / mice (7),
progression to SCC was achieved by the use of chemical
carcinogens, likely promoting ras mutations. Thus, we have
explored additional approaches to achieve the development of
malignant lesions in a genetically defined cancer cell autonomous-driven model, which may therefore facilitate recapitulating
oral tumorigenesis.
We show here that mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible
Cre recombinase under the control of the cytokeratin 14 (K14)
promoter (K14-CreERtam) and the ras oncogene from its own
promoter after Cre excision of a stop signal (LSL-K-ras G12D mice)
develop large papillomas exclusively in the oral cavity and
hyperplasia in the tongue within 1 month of a tamoxifen treatment.
Furthermore, if these mice are crossed with floxed p53 conditional
knockout (p53flox/flox) mice, the compound mice develop carcinomas exclusively on the tongue as early as 2 weeks after tamoxifen
induction. The use of this K14-CreERtam /LSL-K-ras G12D/+ /
p53flox/flox animal model may help recapitulate oral cancer
progression in a genetically defined two-hit system involving ras
activation and p53 inactivation, thus facilitating the study of the
molecular mechanisms underlying HNSCC progression. In this
regard, we show that the activation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is an early event in both oral
benign and malignant lesions and that targeting mTOR by the use
of rapamycin halts tumor progression in this genetically defined
oral cancer model, thereby prolonging animal survival.

Materials and Methods
Generation of mice with K-ras G12D activation and p53 deletion.
Mouse strains, K14-CreERtam (The Jackson Laboratory), LSL-K-ras G12D, and
p53flox/flox, have been described (12–14). Their genetic backgrounds were as
follows: K14-CreERtam and p53flox/flox, FVB/N; LSL-K-ras G12D, 129Sv. K14CreERtam mice were crossed with LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice to generate K14CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice and subsequently bred with p53flox/flox mice to
generate K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/p53flox/+ mice. These mice were further
crossed with p53flox/flox to generate K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/p53flox/flox
line. K14-CreERtam mice were also crossed to Rosa26-LacZ homozygous
reporter mice to generate K14-CreERtam/Rosa26-LacZ mice. K14-CreERtam
mice were used as heterozygous in all the lines established. Tamoxifen was
administered to 1-mo-old animals, 1 mg/mouse/d orally, for 5 consecutive
days. Control mice received only the tamoxifen solvent (sunflower oil) with the
same schedule. Genotyping was performed on tail biopsies by PCR using
specific primers (12–14). Excision of the stop cassette from the LSL-K-ras G12D
allele was determined in DNA purified from tissues of wild-type and the
indicated compound mice treated with or without tamoxifen using the
following primers: 5¶-GGGTAGGTGTTGGGATAGCTG-¶1 and 3¶-TCCGAATTCAGTGACTACAGATGTACAGAG-3¶ (sequence obtained from Dr. Tyler Jacks
laboratory, Koch Institute at MIT, Cambridge, MA). Cre-mediated recombination of the p53 floxed allele was confirmed as previously described (14). All
experiments involving mice were carried out according to NIH-approved
protocols, in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Rapamycin administration. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was diluted
in aqueous solution of 5.2% Tween 80 (Sigma) and 5.2% polyethyleneglycol
(PEG-400; Hampton Research), as previously described (15), and injected i.p.
at a final dose of 10 mg/kg every other day.
Histology, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and Western
blotting. One hour before euthanasia, mice were injected i.p. with
5¶-bromo-2¶-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 100 Ag/g body weight) for cell proliferation assays. All tumor lesions and control tissues were dissected, fixed
overnight in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature,
dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. H&E-stained sections were used
for diagnostic purposes, and unstained serial sections for immunohistochemical studies. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously
described (10). Western blots were performed on lysates from frozen tissues.
Protein concentration was determined, and 50 Ag of total proteins were
separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and
blocked with 5% dry milk. Antibodies used include cyclin D1 (92G2),
phospho-S6 ribosomal protein Ser240/244 (pS6), and phospho-p44/42
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Thr202/Tyr204 (pMAPK 9101)
from Cell Signaling Technology; and cytokeratin 1 (MK1; Covance);
antibodies to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Zymed), BrdUrd
(Biogenex), tubulin, MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and
DUSP-14/MKP-6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were also used. The antibodies
for K14 and filaggrin were kindly provided by Dr. J. Segre (National Human
Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD). h-Galactosidase histochemistry was performed on cryostat section from snap-frozen OCTembedded tissue samples (10). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using the
In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, AP (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The evaluation of the immunohistochemistry was conducted
blindly, without knowledge of the origin and genotype. Tissues were
classified based on the staining intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2,
moderate staining; and 3, strong staining) and the percentage of positive
cells (0, between 0% and 25% of stained cells; 1, between 25% and 50%; 2,
between 50% and 75%; 3, between 75% and 100% of cells stained). Results
were scored by multiplying the percentage of positive cells by the intensity,
as previously described (16).
Hierarchical clustering and data visualization. The staining scores
that resulted from immunohistochemistry were converted into scaled

recombination in the oral cavity. The double K14-CreERtam/Rosa26-LacZ
transgenic mice were treated with tamoxifen or solvent (control) orally during
5 consecutive days. Skin, oral mucosa, and tongue biopsies were taken 1 mo
after treatment. h-Galactosidase activity was readily detected in the interfollicular
epidermis and hair follicles. The oral cavity showed scattered positive cells
on the oral mucosa and the epithelial basal layer of the tongue. Dorsal and
ventral tongue presented h-galactosidase in columns of positive cells on the
entire epithelium. Magnifications, 20 (original) and 40 (insets).

values centered on zero, and hierarchical analysis was performed using
Cluster program1 with average linkage based on Pearson’s correlation
coefficient as the selection parameter on the unsupervised approach. The
results were visualized using the Java TreeView software. The clustered data
were arranged with markers on the horizontal axis and tissue samples on
the vertical axis as recently described (16). Two biomarkers with a close
relationship are located next to each other.
Statistical analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and its statistical
analysis, as well as log-rank test followed by a post hoc comparison
(Holm-Sidak test), were performed using the SigmaStat software package.

Results
Development of tumoral oral lesions on tamoxifen-induced
ras activation in K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice. We
explored the consequences of targeting ras to the basal layer of
the oral mucosa and tongue by examining whether mice expressing
a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombinase under the control
of the K14 promoter (17) could induce Cre/LoxP-mediated
recombination when crossed with the Rosa26 reporter animal line.
The administration of tamoxifen to K14-CreERtam/Rosa26-LacZ
mice resulted in the expression of h-galactosidase in epithelial cells
within the interfollicular skin, hair follicle, and bulge region of the
hair follicle (Fig. 1), as previously reported (12). Of interest, these
mice also expressed h-galactosidase in scattered cell populations in
the epithelium lining the tongue (12) and oral mucosa (Fig. 1) but

not when treated with the vehicle (Fig. 1). Thus, this system
enabled the inducible Cre-mediated recombination of sporadic
cells within the oral cavity, likely involving the epithelial stem cell
population, as groups or columns of h-galactosidase–positive cells
initiated at the basal layer were visible beyond 1 month after
tamoxifen treatment in both the tongue and oral mucosa, in spite
of the rapid turnover of the oral epithelial cells (Fig. 1).
Members of the ras oncogene family (H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras)
are often mutated in human cancer (18, 19). A high incidence of ras
mutations occurs in Southeast Asia, where it is associated with
areca nut chewing, but much less frequently mutated in the
Western countries (5, 20, 21). The use of the LSL-K-ras G12D
strain that enables achieving endogenous levels of oncogenic
K-RasG12D protein on the removal of the stop element (13) by the
K14-CreERtam–mediated recombination led to the developed large
exophytic tumors exclusively in the oral mucosa in all mice studied
as early as 1 month after the tamoxifen induction (n = 18; Fig. 2).
In contrast, a group of K14-CreERtam and LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice
treated with tamoxifen and control K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+
animals treated with solvent alone did not develop any lesions

or exhibit any differences in survival rate (Fig. 3 and data not
shown). Tumors arising in tamoxifen-treated K14-CreERtam/LSL-Kras G12D/+ mice were hyperkeratotic squamous cell papillomas
(Fig. 2). Increased cell proliferation, restricted to the basal layers
(Fig. 2), was coupled with cell differentiation, as judged by the
positive immunostaining for filaggrin (Fig. 2). We observed,
however, changes in the pattern of expression of cytokeratins. For
example, K14 was expressed poorly in the basal layer but strongly in
the upper layers of the papillomas, different from its distribution in
normal epithelium (Fig. 2) but similar to that observed in chemically
induced skin papillomas (22). On the other hand, K1 was expressed
in the upper layers of the hyperplastic epithelium but not in the
control normal oral mucosa (Fig. 2). The majority of the tongues
showed a marked hyperplasia with significant acanthosis, papillomatosis, and hyperkeratosis (Fig. 2). No animals developed
carcinomas, but they had to be sacrificed 2 to 3 months after
tamoxifen administration, as these lesions exceeded acceptable size
and thus compromised food intake (Fig. 3).
We confirmed that the treatment with tamoxifen leads to
the CreERtam-dependent recombination of the LSL-K-ras G12D allele

squamous papillomas in the oral mucosa on tamoxifen
treatment. A, papillomas arising from the oral mucosa of
K14-CreERtam/SL-K-ras G12D mice on tamoxifen treatment
were characterized by exophytic growth. B, hyperplastic

grow out of the oral squamous epithelium. Typical features
include hyperkeratosis and the presence of hyperplastic,
well-differentiated squamous epithelium with few apoptotic
cells in the upper layers (TUNEL reaction). Normal
(control ) tongue epithelium is clearly different in control
animals when compared with a highly hyperplastic area in
K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice (below control ). In
these tumors, BrdUrd incorporation is restricted to the
basal layers (detail in inset ), and there is a deregulated
expression of K14; the normal expression pattern is
inverted in tumoral lesions, with enhanced expression in
suprabasal keratinocytes. The expression of K1 is irregular
but limited to the upper layers of the hyperplastic
epithelium. The upper layers of the papillomas express
filaggrin, a differentiation marker. In normal control mucosa,
K14- and BrdUrd-positive cells are seen in the basal
layer. No staining with K1 is evident in this oral mucosa and
the expression of filaggrin is observed only in the upper
layers. C, PCR analysis with primers that flank the stop

by PCR analysis using oligonucleotides flanking the stop cassette
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). No recombination was observed
in the absence of CreERtam expression or tamoxifen induction, and
LSL-K-ras G12D allele recombination was readily demonstrable in
K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice in the oral mucosa, tongue, and
the papillomas arising in tamoxifen-treated mice (Fig. 2).
LSL-K-ras G12D allele recombination effectively occurred in the
skin of K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice treated with tamoxifen
(Supplementary Fig. S1), although these mice did not develop skin
lesions (Supplementary Fig. S1). This is aligned with recent studies
using a different keratinocyte-specific inducible Cre system in which
mice did not develop skin malignancies unless persistently treated
with phorbol esters as tumor promoter (23). Thus, in spite of ras
being likely activated in many K14-expressing squamous epithelia in
our animal system, these animals developed benign tumors only in
the oral mucosa, suggesting that the oral epithelial cells might be
particularly sensitive to ras-induced aberrant cell proliferation.

Excision of p53 cooperates with ras to induce tongue
carcinomas. p53 is one of the most frequently mutated tumor
suppressor gene in human malignancies (24). In HNSCC, mutations
in p53 occur in >50% of the oral cavity cancers and the presence of
mutations that render p53 functionally inactive is associated with
tumor progression and decreased overall survival (25). Loss of
heterozygosity of p53 and inactivating mutations in its coding
sequence or the accelerated destruction of its protein product,
p53, by viral oncoproteins, such as by human papillomavirus E6,
represents a common molecular alteration in HNSCC (3). Thus, to
examine whether alterations in p53 cooperate with ras during oral
carcinogenesis, we bred the K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice
with mice harboring a floxed allele of p53 (14). Remarkably, these
mice developed carcinomas on the tongue as early as 2 weeks after
tamoxifen administration (Fig. 3A) and progressed into clearly
visible carcinomas in only 3 weeks (Fig. 3) The concomitant
activation of LSL-K-ras G12D and deletion of the floxed p53 alleles

mTOR Activation in Oral K-ras–Induced and p53-Induced Tumors

were confirmed by PCR analysis using DNA from these tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
The tumors were well-differentiated SCCs, with moderate
cell atypia and focal dyskeratosis (Fig. 3). Dysplasias and
microcarcinomas were also observed. Tongue carcinomas presented increased cell proliferation, with BrdUrd-positive cells
distributed at all levels of the epithelium (Fig. 3). Unlike in
the normal squamous epithelium, K14 expression was stronger in
the upper layers in the carcinomatous epithelium (Fig. 3), similarly
to that observed in ras-induced oral papillomas. K1 and filaggrin
were expressed only in the upper layers of the malignant
epithelium (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we observed a distinct susceptibility of tumor progression between the tongue and the oral
mucosa. In contrast to the large SCC lesions in the tongue, the oral
mucosa of the K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+/p53 flox/flox mice
developed only squamous papillomas, with no signs of malignant
transformation. Thus, the squamous epithelium of the tongue
seems to be highly susceptible to ras-induced transformation but
only when relieved from the tumor-suppressive activity of p53.
Molecular mechanisms contributing to ras-induced HNSCC
progression. As expected, the carcinomas exhibited an elevated
proliferative capacity, as judged by the increase in CCDN1 and

PCNA staining (Fig. 4). The normal oral mucosa and tongue
and their tumoral lesions all expressed K14, albeit with a distinct
distribution pattern (see above). All papillomas expressed high
levels of K1. This suggested that in all benign lesions, cell
differentiation might restrain the oncogenic potential of ras. In
contrast, in the absence of a functional p53, epithelial cells from
the tongue may lose their ability to couple proliferation with
differentiation, thereby resulting in malignant growth.
We next focused on the status of activation of the MAPK and Akt/
mTOR pathway, two key signaling pathways activated by Ras (26, 27),
by examining the levels of pMAPK and pS6, the most downstream
target of the Akt/mTOR signaling route. We did not observe an
increase in the level of pMAPK in ras-induced tumors, which is
aligned with the observation that MAPK activation is not often
observed in primary human HNSCC (28). This was confirmed by
Western blot analysis of lysates from papillomas and carcinomas
(Supplementary Fig. S2). By systematic analysis of potential events
leading to MAPK inactivation in these cancer lesions, we found that
ras-induced tumors overexpress a MAPK phosphatase, DUSP-14
(refs. 29, 30; Supplementary Fig. S2). Although the potential role of
DUSP-14 in preventing MAPK activation is under current evaluation,
the most remarkable finding in these tumors was a clear increase in

Figure 4. Immunohistochemical analysis of biomarkers in the oral mucosa and tongue lesions arising in the two-hit animal model. A, control oral mucosa: PCNA
expression in normal mucosa shows positive reaction exclusively in the basal layer, and CCDN1 immunostaining revealed scattered mildly positive cells mainly
in the basal layer. No staining with pMAPK is evident and low expression levels of pS6 are seen in the upper layers. Papillomas K-ras G12D: PCNA immunoreaction is
similar to that of the normal epithelium; CCDN1 shows a different staining pattern with many intensely and moderately stained cells in the basal layers. Papillomas
show faint expression of pMAPK in few cells (arrows ) in the more differentiated areas. Elevated pS6 immunoreactivity is observed in basal and intermediate layers
of papillomas. Control tongue: PCNA expression in normal tongue is seen in the basal layer together with scattered and low-intensity CCDN1-positive cells. No
evident staining for pMAPK is observed. pS6 immunoreactivity is located in the intermediate and upper layers. Carcinomas K-ras G12D p53F: the tongue carcinomas
show increased mitotic activity reflected by a higher number of PCNA- and CCDN1-positive cells randomly distributed at all levels of the carcinomatous epithelium.
Arrow, pMAPK detection is quite limited, showing only few positive cells. pS6 is highly expressed across all areas in tongue carcinomas. Original magnification, 20.
B, hierarchical clustering of immunohistochemical staining score for the different biomarkers studied. Tissues were classified based on the histology: normal,
hyperplasia (hyper. ), papilloma (papillo. ), and carcinoma (carcin. ). The collected samples were from oral mucosa (OM ) and the tongue (TO ). The genotypes were
wild-type (wt ), K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ (K-ras G12D ), and K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/p53flox/flox (K-ras G12D p53 F/F ). Numbers indicate individual animals.
The clustered data were arranged with markers on the horizontal axis and tissue samples on the vertical axis. Biomarkers with a close relationship are located closer
to each other. Deep red, high staining scores (strong staining intensity and 75–100% of positive-staining cells); light green, low staining scores (weak staining
intensity and <25% of cells positive for immunohistochemistry). The accumulation of pS6, reflecting the activation of the mTOR pathway, correlated best with the
malignant conversion from papilloma to carcinoma.

the level of pS6 in carcinomas and oral papillomas, which contrasts
with the low level of pS6 in the normal tissues (Fig. 4).
The relationship between proliferative and differentiation
markers and the activation of MAPK and the Akt/mTOR pathway
was nicely reflected by the nonsupervised hierarchical class
comparison of the immunostaining results (16), showing the
existence of three well-defined clusters (Fig. 4). Control tissues
grouped together, whereas hyperplasias and papillomas formed a
separate group regardless of their genotype. All carcinomas defined
a clearly distinct group, characterized by the increased expression
of proliferative markers, PCNA and CCDN1, and basal keratins,
K14, a reduced expression of suprabasal keratins, K1, and a
remarkable accumulation of pS6. Indeed, the activation of the
mTOR pathway correlated with the malignant conversion from
papilloma to carcinoma, thus suggesting that the mTOR signaling
route may contribute to carcinoma progression caused by the
concomitant activation of ras and the inactivation of p53 in the
oral cavity.

Targeting mTOR halts the progression of K-ras–induced and
p53-induced oral tumors. These observations, prior studies
supporting that the activation of the Akt-mTOR pathway is a
frequent event in HNSCC (15, 31–33), and the emerging use of
mTOR inhibitors in cancer treatment (34) prompted us to explore
whether interfering with mTOR signaling could prevent tumor
development in this model. The treatment of mice harboring
ras-induced tumors with rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of mTOR
function (35), led to a dramatic decrease in pS6 levels in the
tumoral lesions, as judged by immunohistochemical and Western
blot analysis (Fig. 5). We next explored whether the development of
these lesions was dependent on mTOR activation. For these
studies, we induced Cre-mediated ras activation in animals
harboring wild-type p53 or its floxed allele by tamoxifen
administration and, 1 week later, initiated the rapamycin
treatment. The treatment of K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+ mice
with rapamycin prevented the development of oral tumors and
increased their life span (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5). This was also clearly

mTOR Activation in Oral K-ras–Induced and p53-Induced Tumors

observed in mice in which ras activation and p53 deletion led to
squamous carcinomas. Indeed, rapamycin treatment prevented
tumor progression and extended the life expectancy of these
mice (Fig. 5).

Discussion
The combined inactivation of p53 and activation of ras in a
cellular compartment that includes the oral epithelial stem cells by
the administration of tamoxifen to K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+/
p53flox/flox mice may provide a relevant two-hit animal model
system resulting in the rapid development of oral squamous
carcinomas in the tongue. This finding is consistent with the
emerging notion that oral carcinomas arise from genetic
alterations in the epithelial stem cell compartment (36). K14CreERtam also targets gene expression to self-renewing cells in
other epithelial tissues, including the hair follicles and the
interfollicular epithelium in the skin (12). However, activation of
a single allele of ras and alterations in p53 were unable to promote
tumorigenesis in the skin, but sufficient for oral carcinogenesis,
suggesting that different epithelial stem cells may harbor distinct
transforming potential. There were even differences between the
oral mucosa and the epithelium of the tongue. Whereas ras
activation with or without p53 inactivation caused the development of papillomas in the oral mucosa, ras alone caused only
hyperproliferation of the epithelium of the tongue. However, ras
activation and p53 deletion resulted in the rapid development of
squamous carcinomas exclusively in the tongue. This increased
susceptibility to malignant conversion of the squamous epithelium
of the tongue may explain the higher incidence of tongue HNSCC
with respect to all other anatomic locations in the head and neck
region (37) even if the exposure to carcinogens, such as those in
tobacco, results in p53 mutations in the epithelium lining the
entire oropharynx (3).
This genetically defined HNSCC model system that does not
require the use of tumor promoters affecting the stroma and
connective tissue may now enable exploring the nature of the
tumor cell autonomous molecular events driving SCC progression.

Among them, the ability to uncouple epithelial cell proliferation
with differentiation and the activation of the Akt-mTOR signaling
pathway resulting in pS6 accumulation seem to represent early
events in HNSCC progression (15, 16, 31–33). On the other hand,
this model system enabled us to explore whether interfering with
the activity of mTOR may represent a suitable approach to prevent
or treat oral cancer. Indeed, we observed that decreasing mTOR
activity by the administration of rapamycin after genetic recombination leading to p53 deletion and ras activation was sufficient
to prevent tumor progression. These findings, together with the
recent observation that rapamycin causes the regression of SCC
lesions caused by the classic two-step skin chemical carcinogenesis
model (38) resulting from the accumulation of ras and p53
mutations (38, 39), support the potential clinical benefit of
targeting mTOR for the prevention and treatment of HNSCC,
particularly in clinical cases that present premalignant and
cancerous lesions harboring activated mutations in ras. Ultimately,
the K14-CreERtam/LSL-K-ras G12D/+/p53flox/flox two-hit animal
model system may represent a suitable platform for exploring the
underlying molecular mechanism and genetic and epigenetic event
determining the susceptibility to malignant progression of tumoral
lesions arising from the distinct stratified epithelia of the oral
cavity and may facilitate the development of new targeted
approaches for the treatment and prevention of HNSCC.
