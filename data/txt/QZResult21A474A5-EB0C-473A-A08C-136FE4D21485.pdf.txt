Abstract
Tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) mRNA has been reported
to be highly expressed in human head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, but the involvement of TRIM32 in carcinogenesis
has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found by using
yeast two-hybrid screening that TRIM32 binds to Ablinteractor 2 (Abi2), which is known as a tumor suppressor
and a cell migration inhibitor, and we showed that TRIM32
mediates the ubiquitination of Abi2. Overexpression of
TRIM32 promoted degradation of Abi2, resulting in enhancement of cell growth, transforming activity, and cell motility,
whereas a dominant-negative mutant of TRIM32 lacking the
RING domain inhibited the degradation of Abi2. In addition,
we found that TRIM32 suppresses apoptosis induced by cisdiamminedichloroplatinum (II) in HEp2 cell lines. These
findings suggest that TRIM32 is a novel oncogene that
promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to
anticancer drugs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(14):5572–80]

Introduction
Ubiquitination is a versatile posttranslational modification
mechanism used by eukaryotic cells mainly to control protein
levels through proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Ubiquitin conjugation is achieved by several enzymes that act in concert, including
a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
(E2), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3; refs. 1, 2). E3 is thought to
be the component of the ubiquitin conjugation system that is most
directly responsible for substrate recognition. Enzymes belonging
to class E3 that have thus far been identified include members of
the HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus), RING-finger,
and U-box families of proteins (3–5).
Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are characterized by the
presence of a RING finger, one or two zinc-binding motifs named
B-boxes, and an associated coiled-coil region (6). Most TRIM
proteins have been reported to have a role in the ubiquitination
process, for example, TRIM25 (EFP) ubiquitinates 14-3-3j (7),
estrogen receptor a (8), and retinoic acid–inducible gene I (9).
Furthermore, several TRIM family members are involved in various
cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation, cell growth,
apoptosis, development, and oncogenesis (10–12).
The TRIM family protein TRIM32 was identified as a protein that
interacts with the activation domain of lentiviral Tat proteins

(activators of viral transcription; ref. 13). Each TRIM family
member is characterized by a specific carboxyl-terminal domain
(6). TRIM32 contains six repeats of the NHL (NCL-1, HT2A, and
LIN-41) motif, which is likely to mediate protein-protein interactions (14). Point mutations of human TRIM32 have been
reported in two autosomal recessive genetic disorders: limb-girdle
muscular dystrophy type 2H, which is a myopathy with a primary
or predominant involvement of the pelvic or shoulder girdle
musculature (15), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, pigmentary retinopathy, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, learning disabilities, and hypogenitalism (16). Moreover, it
has been reported that TRIM32 is highly expressed in the occipital
lobe of patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with that in
healthy controls (17). It has been shown that TRIM32 has a
ubiquitin ligase activity for actin or Piasy (small ubiquitin-like
modifier ligase; ref. 18). TRIM32 ubiquitinates actin in vitro downregulates endogenous actin in HEK293 cells and interacts directly
with myosin, but not with actin (19). TRIM32 regulates UVBinduced keratinocyte apoptosis through induction of nuclear
factor-nB by promoting the degradation of Piasy (18). Furthermore,
it has been shown that TRIM32 protein expression is elevated in a
mouse skin carcinogenesis model and in human skin squamous
cell carcinoma and that TRIM32 mRNA expression is elevated in
human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (20, 21). However,
the role of TRIM32 in the progression of carcinogenesis has not
been fully clarified.
Abl-interactor 2 (Abi2) has been identified as a protein that
specifically binds to both the src homology 3 (SH3) and carboxyterminal proline-rich sequences of Abl, which has been shown to
be one of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases involved in the regulation of
intercellular signals (22). Abi2 promotes Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc2 and inactivation of Cdc2 kinase activity, leading to
suppression of cell growth (23). Coexpression of a truncated form
of Abi2 with c-Abl activates the oncogenic potential of c-Abl,
suggesting that the full-length Abi2 functions as a tumor
suppressor (22). Furthermore, Abi family members have been
reported to affect cell motility. Abi1 promotes cell motility (24),
whereas NESH (Abi3) suppresses cell motility and metastatic
dissemination of malignant cells (25, 26). Deletion of the SH3
domain and carboxy-terminal proline-rich sequences in Bcr-Abl
prevents Abi2-mediated degradation and inhibits cell migration,
suggesting that the Abi2 negatively regulates cell motility (27).
In this study, with the aim of elucidating the molecular function
of TRIM32 in carcinogenesis, we identified Abi2 as a novel TRIM32binding protein by using yeast two-hybrid screening. TRIM32
enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of Abi2. We also
found that overexpression of TRIM32 promoted cell growth,
transforming activity and cell motility. In addition, we found that
TRIM32 suppressed apoptosis induced by cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cDDP) in HEp2 cell lines, originating from human
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Our results provide evidence

for a direct role of TRIM32 in carcinogenesis, cell motility, and
resistance to anticancer drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HEK293T, Neuro2a, and HEp2 and its cDDP-resistant
variant (HEp2/cDDP) cell lines were cultured under an atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37jC in DMEM (Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEp2 and HEp2/cDDP cells were provided by
Nippon Kayaku Co. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured under the same conditions
in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS; Camblex).
Human tumor collection. Patients with head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma who gave informed consent were selected for this study. Tumor
and surrounding uninvolved mucosa samples in the same patient were
removed during surgery and subjected to immunoblot analysis and
immunostaining with anti-TRIM32 antibody (1:1,000 dilution, mouse
polyclonal, Abnova), anti-cytokeratin 1/10 (0.2 Ag/mL; LH1, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti–cytokeratin 15 (0.2 Ag/mL; LHK15, Santa Cruz), antibasic cytokeratin (0.1 Ag/mL; AE3, Santa Cruz), anti-Abi2 (0.4 Ag/mL; P-20,
Santa Cruz), and anti–phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10; 5 Ag/mL; rabbit
polyclonal, Millipore).
Cloning of cDNAs and plasmid construction. Human TRIM32 and
Abi2 cDNAs were amplified from HeLa cDNA by the PCR with BlendTaq
(Takara) using the following primers: 5¶-GCAATGGCTGCAGCAGCAGCTTCT-3¶ (TRIM32-sense), 5¶-CCCCTATGGGGTGGAATATCTTCT-3¶
(TRIM32 -antisense), 5¶-GCCATGGCGGAGCTGCAGATGCTG-3¶ (Abi2 sense), and 5¶-TGCCTACTCAGAATAATGCATGAT-3¶ (Abi2-antisense). The
amplified fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene).
FLAG-tagged, HA-tagged, or Myc-tagged TRIM32 and Abi2 cDNAs were
then subcloned into pCR, pCGN, and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for expression in
eukaryotic cells, pET30a (Novagen) for the production of His6-tagged fusion
protein, pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Bioscience) for the production of glutathione S-transferase (GST)–tagged fusion protein, and pBTM116 and pACT2
(Clontech) for a yeast two-hybrid system. Deletion mutants of TRIM32
cDNA containing amino acids 65-653, 163-653, 386-653, and 1-309 were
amplified by PCR and subcloned.
Yeast two-hybrid screening. Complementary DNA encoding the fulllength of human TRIM32 was fused in-frame to the nucleotide sequence for
the LexA domain (BD) in the yeast two-hybrid vector pBTM116. To screen
for proteins that interact with TRIM32, we transfected yeast strain L40
(Invitrogen) stably expressing the corresponding pBTM116 vector with a
human HeLa cDNA library (Clontech).
Transfection, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis.
HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method and
lysed in a solution containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, leupeptin (10 Ag/mL), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 Amol/L Na3VO4, 400 Amol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L
NaF, and 10 mmol/L sodium PPi. The cell lysates were centrifuged at
16,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and the resulting supernatant was
incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4jC. Protein A or G-sepharose
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had equilibrated with the same
solution was added to the mixture, which was then rotated for 1 h at 4jC.
The resin was separated by centrifugation, washed five times with ice-cold
lysis buffer, and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. For an in vivo ubiquitination assay, the cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, leupeptin
(10 Ag/mL), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 Amol/L Na3VO4,
400 Amol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L NaF, and 10 mmol/L sodium PPi.
Immunoblot analysis was performed with the following primary antibodies: anti–c-Myc (1 Ag/mL; 9E10, Covance), anti-FLAG (1 Ag/mL; M5,
Sigma), anti-HA (1 Ag/mL; HA.11, Covance), anti-HA (1 Ag/mL; Y11, Santa
Cruz), anti-GST (0.1 Ag/mL; B-14, Santa Cruz), anti-TRIM32 (mouse
polyclonal, Abnova), anti-ubiquitin (1 Ag/mL; P4D1, Santa Cruz), anti–atubulin (1 Ag/mL; TU-01, ZYMED), anti-Hsp90 (1 Ag/mL; 68, Transduction
Laboratories), and anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 Ag/
mL; 6C5, Ambion). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (1:10,000

dilution, Promega) or goat IgG (1:5,000 dilution, Santa Cruz) and an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham).
Recombinant proteins. GST-tagged TRIM32 was expressed in XL-1 Blue
cells and then purified by reduced glutathione–sepharose beads (Roche).
His6-FLAG-tagged Abi2 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3;
Invitrogen) and then purified by using ProBond metal affinity beads
(Invitrogen).
In vitro pull-down assay. GST-TRIM32 (0.25 Ag) and His6-FLAG-Abi2
(0.5 Ag) were mixed in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and
1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4jC. The binding mixtures were incubated with
anti-GST antibody for 1 h at 4jC. Protein G-sepharose was added to the
mixture, and then the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4jC. The resin was
separated by centrifugation, washed five times with buffer, and then boiled
in SDS sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-FLAG
antibody.
Pulse-chase analysis with cycloheximide. Transiently transfected
HEK293T cells were cultured with cycloheximide at the concentration of
50 Ag/mL and then incubated for various times. Cell lysates were then
subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with an antibody to
FLAG.
Retroviral infection. Retroviral expression vectors for FLAG-TRIM32
wild-type (WT), FLAG-TRIM32 deletion mutant of RING-finger domain
(DRING), or FLAG-Abi2 was constructed with pMX-puro. Retroviral
expression vector for TRIM32(WT) or c-Src(Y527F) was constructed with
pMX-hyg. Retroviral expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr.
Kitamura (University of Tokyo). For retrovirus-mediated gene expression,
Neuro2A and NIH 3T3 cells were infected with retroviruses produced by
Plat-E packaging cells and HEp2 cells were infected with retroviruses
produced by Plat-A packaging cells. Cells were then cultured in the presence
of puromycin (2 Ag/mL) or hygromycin B (0.2 mg/mL; Sigma).
RNA interference. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide
sequences specific for mouse and human TRIM32 mRNA were designed by
Silencer Predesigned siRNA (Ambion) and corresponded to nucleotides 808
to 826 and 150 to 168, respectively. siRNAs were transfected by siPORT
NeoFX (Ambion) into NIH 3T3, HEp2, and HEp2/cDDP cells ( final
concentration, 10 nmol/L). After 48 h, the resulting cell lines were checked
by real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblot analysis.
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA (1 Ag) isolated from various cell
lines using Isogen (Wako) was subjected to reverse transcription with
ReverTraAce (Toyobo). The resulting cDNA was subjected to real-time
quantitative PCR by TaqMan gene expression assays following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). The assays were performed with a mouse or human TRIM32-specific TaqMan probe and
primers in an ABI-PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems). 18S rRNA was selected as an internal control to normalize the
expression levels. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Cell cycle analysis. NIH 3T3 cell lines were incubated in DMEM with
0.1% CS for 24 h for serum starvation. The cells released from serum
starvation were harvested at indicated times and suspended in a solution
containing 20 mmol/L HEPES, 160 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and
0.04% digitonin. The cells were incubated at 37jC for 1 h in a solution with
RNase A (100 Ag/mL; Novagen) and propidium iodide (20 Ag/mL) and then
analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest software
(Becton Dickinson).
Sulforhodamine B assay. Cells were seeded at a density of 2,000 per
well in a 96-well plate and then fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid at
indicated times. The cells were stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (SRB)
solution, washed using 1% acetic acid, and then solubilized with 10 mmol/L
Tris base. Absorbances were measured by using a plate reader at 570 nm
(28, 29).
Colony formation assay. For the colony formation assay, 1  105 cells
were plated in 60-mm dishes containing 0.4% soft agar and cultured for
2 wk. The numbers of colonies with a diameter of >0.1 mm in randomized
areas (1 cm2) were counted.
Wound healing assay. A six-well plate was coated overnight with
20 Ag/mL fibronectin (Asahi Techno Glass) in PBS, and then cells were
seeded (3  105 per well) in DMEM with 0.1% CS overnight. The injured line

of cells and photographed at indicated times.
Transwell migration assay. Twelve-well polycarbonate transwell
migration chambers with 8-Am pores (Corning) were coated overnight on
the underside with 20 Ag/mL fibronectin in PBS. The lower compartment
was filled with DMEM containing 0.1% CS. Cells were cultured in DMEM
with 0.1% CS for 24 h and then placed at a density of 1  105 cells in the
upper part of the transwell plate and incubated for 4 h in a serum-starved
condition. The cells on the upper surface of the insert were carefully
removed with cotton pads. The cells on the lower surface were fixed with
3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33258. The number of cells
that had migrated was counted under a fluorescence microscope.
Apoptosis assay. Assessment of apoptosis was performed by measurement of sub-G1 peak and detection of cleaved caspase-3. For sub-G1 peak,
HEp2 cells were incubated with or without cDDP (25 Amol/L) for 24 h. The
cells were treated with propidium iodide and then sub-G1 peak was
analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. For cleaved caspase-3, HEp2
cells were incubated with cDDP (25 Amol/L) for various times. Cell lysates
were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti–caspase-3 (1:1,000
dilution; 3G2, Cell Signaling) and anti–cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175; 1:1,000
dilution; 5A1, Cell Signaling) antibodies.
Statistical analysis. The unpaired Student’s t test was used to determine
the statistical significance of experimental data.

Results
Elevated expression of TRIM32 in human head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma. It has been reported that TRIM32
mRNA expression was elevated in human head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma. Therefore, we examined the expression level of
TRIM32 protein in tumor samples that had been surgically excised.
Immunoblot analysis with anti-TRIM32 antibody showed that
TRIM32 protein levels were considerably elevated in 70% of tumor
tissues (except for samples 5, 6, and 10) compared with the levels in
normal tissues in the same patient (Fig. 1A). To determine whether
overexpression of TRIM32 antigen activity depends on the volume
of epithelial components in the samples, the same cell lysates
were immunoblotted with antibodies to cytokeratin 1/10 and
cytokeratin 15, which have frequently been found in squamous
epithelium and squamous cell carcinoma, and an antibody to
basic cytokeratin. Whereas the expression levels of cytokeratin
15 were elevated in normal tissues except for sample 6, those of
cytokeratin 1/10 and basic cytokeratin showed no difference
between tumor and normal tissues (Fig. 1A). These results suggest
that overexpression of TRIM32 in tumor tissues is independent
of the abundance of epithelial components. We next performed

immunohistochemical analysis using squamous cell carcinoma
tissues and normal tissues of the human tongue (Fig. 1B). TRIM32
proteins were detected within the cytoplasm in tumor cells but
also in normal epidermal cells near the basement membrane. We
also stained the same sample with anti–phosphorylated histone
H3 antibody as a mitosis marker. Both tumor cells and normal
epidermal cells were stained, corresponding to the results obtained
by using the anti-TRIM32 antibody. These results show that the
expression of TRIM32 is elevated in human head and neck
carcinoma but also in normal epidermal cells during the mitotic
phase.
TRIM32 interacts with Abi2. To identify proteins that interact
with TRIM32, we screened the pACT2 HeLa cDNA library by using
pBTM116-hTRIM32 plasmid as a bait. Thirty-five positive clones
were isolated on Leu-Trp-His–deficient medium from 1.36  106
transformants. Three clones (clones 10, 18, and 26) of the positive
clones have sequence identities with the human Abi2 cDNA
(National Center for Biotechnology Information accession number
BT009920). We tested whether TRIM32 physically interacts with
Abi2 in vivo and in vitro. We transfected expression vectors
encoding FLAG-TRIM32 and/or HA-Abi2 in HEK293T cells. Cell
lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody to
HA or FLAG, and the resulting precipitates were subjected to
immunoblot analysis with an antibody to FLAG or HA, respectively.
FLAG-TRIM32 was selectively coprecipitated by anti-HA antibody,
and HA-Abi2 was also coprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody
(Fig. 2A). We also verified the interaction between endogenous
TRIM32 and endogenous Abi2 by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B)
and the colocalization by immunofluorescent staining (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, recombinant GST-TRIM32 and His6FLAG-Abi2 were used in an in vitro pull-down assay and the assay
indicated that GST-TRIM32 specifically binds to His6-FLAG-Abi2

in vitro (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the binding region of TRIM32
to Abi2, we constructed several deletion mutants of TRIM32 and
compared their abilities to bind to Abi2 (Fig. 2D, left). An in vivo
binding assay showed that deletion of the NHL domain abolishes
the binding to Abi2, indicating that the NHL domain of TRIM32 is
required for interaction with Abi2 (Fig. 2D, right).
TRIM32 mediates ubiquitination and degradation of Abi2.
To elucidate whether TRIM32 ubiquitinates Abi2, we performed an
in vivo ubiquitination assay. Expression vectors encoding
Myc-Abi2, FLAG-TRIM32, and HA-ubiquitin were transfected in
HEK293T cells, and their lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody to Myc and then to immunoblot analysis
with an antibody to HA. Although Myc-Abi2 was slightly
ubiquitinated even without overexpression of TRIM32, overexpression of TRIM32 considerably enhanced polyubiquitination of MycAbi2 (Fig. 3A). We next examined the possible effect of TRIM32 on
the degradation of Abi2 in vivo. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that
the expression of WT TRIM32 promoted the degradation of Abi2,
whereas TRIM32(DRING) delayed it (Fig. 3B). To determine
whether TRIM32 enhances the degradation of Abi2 through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we examined the stability of
endogenous Abi2 by overexpression of TRIM32 with a proteasome
inhibitor. Neuro2a cells infected with a retrovirus vector encoding
FLAG-TRIM32(WT) were incubated with or without a proteasome
inhibitor, LLnL. Overexpression of TRIM32(WT) diminished
expression of endogenous Abi2, but the expression of Abi2 was
restored by LLnL (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we examined the stability
of endogenous Abi2 by RNA interference of TRIM32. To knockdown endogenous TRIM32, siRNA specific for mouse TRIM32
(si-TRIM32) or nontargeting siRNA as a control (si-control) was
transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, resulting in silencing of TRIM32
at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3D). The expression level of

Figure 3. TRIM32 mediates ubiquitination
and degradation of Abi2. A, in vivo
ubiquitination assay for Abi2 by TRIM32.
Expression vectors for Myc-Abi2,
FLAG-TRIM32, and HA-ubiquitin were
transfected into HEK293T cells, and cell
lysates were immunoprecipitated with
anti-Myc antibody and then anti-HA
immunoblot analysis was performed to
detect the ubiquitination of Abi2. B,
pulse-chase analysis of Abi2 with TRIM32.
HEK293T cells were transfected with
expression vectors for FLAG-Abi2 and
HA-TRIM32(WT), HA-TRIM32(DRING), or
an empty vector (Mock). Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the cells were cultured in
the presence of cycloheximide (50 Ag/mL)
for the indicated times. Cell lysates were
then subjected to immunoblot analysis with
anti-FLAG and anti-Hsp90 antibodies (left ).
Intensity of the FLAG-Abi2 bands was
normalized by that of the corresponding
Hsp90 bands and then expressed as a
percentage of the normalized value for
time 0 (right ). C, down-regulation of
endogenous Abi2 by TRIM32. Neuro2a
cells infected with a retrovirus
encoding FLAG-TRIM32(WT), FLAGTRIM32(DRING), or Mock were incubated
with or without LLnL (10 Amol/L) for 4 or 8 h,
and cell lysates were subjected to
immunoblot analysis with anti-Abi2
antibody. The intensity of Abi2 bands was
normalized by that of the corresponding
a-tubulin bands, and ratio of Mock at time
zero was defined as 1. D, stabilization of
endogenous Abi2 by RNA interference for
TRIM32 . The TRIM32 mRNAs or proteins
derived from NIH 3T3 cells transfected
with siRNA specific for mouse TRIM32
(si-TRIM32) or with nontargeting siRNA
as a control (si-control) and from
nontransfected cells were measured by
real-time quantitative PCR or immunoblot
analysis. Cell lysates were also
immunoblotted with anti-Abi2 and
anti–a-tubulin antibodies. The intensity of
Abi2 bands was normalized by that of the
corresponding a-tubulin bands.

endogenous Abi2 was elevated in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with siTRIM32 compared with the level in cells transfected with si-control
or nontransfected cells. These results suggest that TRIM32
mediates ubiquitination of Abi2 and thereby promotes its
degradation depending on the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
TRIM32 affects cell growth and cell cycle. Abi2 has been
reported to inhibit cell growth. Therefore, we examined the effect
of TRIM32 on cell growth. We infected retroviruses encoding
FLAG-TRIM32(WT), FLAG-TRIM32(DRING), or an empty vector
(Mock) into NIH 3T3 cells and then counted the cell numbers at
indicated times. Overexpression of TRIM32(WT) markedly increased growth rate compared with that of Mock, whereas
overexpression of TRIM32(DRING) decreased growth rate
(Fig. 4A, left) and si-TRIM32 attenuated the cell growth more
slowly than did si-control (Fig. 4A, right). The effect of TRIM32 on
cell proliferation was also confirmed by SRB assay (Supplementary
Fig. S2). To further confirm that TRIM32 affects the cell cycle, we
synchronized the cells at G0-G1 phase by serum starvation and
analyzed the time for progression to S phase. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that NIH 3T3 cells expressing TRIM32(WT)
progressed to S phase more rapidly than Mock, whereas
TRIM32(DRING) slightly delayed the progression to S phase (Fig.
4B). Moreover, the cells were synchronized at the G1-S boundary

using aphidicolin after serum starvation for 24 h and then released.
Flow cytometric analysis showed that TRIM32(WT) accelerated the
cell cycle, whereas TRIM32(DRING) decelerated it (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
We also examined whether TRIM32 modulates Abi2-mediated
cell growth arrest. We infected NIH 3T3 cells with retroviruses
encoding FLAG-Abi2 and with a retrovirus vector encoding TRIM32.
The expression of Abi2 in the cells stably expressing Abi2 and
TRIM32 was reduced compared with that in cells expressing only
Abi2, and overexpression of TRIM32 attenuated the suppression of
cell growth by Abi2 (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, to determine whether TRIM32 affects cell transformation of overexpressed c-Src, we established NIH 3T3 cell lines
stably expressing the active form of c-Src(Y529F) by retroviral
infection. The resulting cell line was further infected with
recombinant retroviruses encoding FLAG-tagged TRIM32(WT) or
TRIM32(DRING). These NIH 3T3 cell lines were then assayed for
their ability to form colonies in soft agar to evaluate their ability to
undergo anchorage-independent growth. The cells that had not
been infected c-Src(Y529F) formed few colonies, whereas cells
expressing c-Src(Y529F) formed many colonies. The combination
of c-Src(Y529F) and TRIM32(WT) increased the ability of
anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest

that TRIM32 functions as a positive regulator for anchorageindependent growth in collaboration with c-Src.
TRIM32 induces NIH 3T3 cell motility. Abi family proteins
have been reported to mediate cell motility. Thus, we examined
whether TRIM32 affects cell motility by degradation of Abi2. First,
we performed a wound healing assay using several stably transfected NIH 3T3 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4A, TRIM32 increased
cell proliferation rates. Therefore, NIH 3T3 cell lines were cultured
under the condition of serum starvation to arrest the cells at G0-G1
phase to rule out the effect of cell proliferation. TRIM32(WT)
facilitated repair of cell injury more rapidly than Mock, whereas
TRIM32(DRING) and si-TRIM32 suppressed cell injury repair (Fig.
5A and B). To further confirm the effect of TRIM32 on cell motility,
we performed a transwell migration assay. NIH 3T3 cell lines were
precultured in DMEM with 0.1% CS and then incubated in the top
of the chamber for 4 h. The migration assay clarified that
TRIM32(WT) increases the number of cells migrating compared
with Mock but that TRIM32(DRING) and si-TRIM32 do not (Fig. 5C
and D). These results indicate that TRIM32 enhances NIH 3T3 cell
motility and that the RING-finger domain of TRIM32 is indispensable for activation of cell motility.

TRIM32 suppresses apoptosis induced by cDDP. The
sensitivities of HEp2 and the cDDP-resistant variant (HEp2/cDDP)
to various concentrations of cDDP were determined by SRB assay
and are plotted in the survival curve shown in Fig. 6A (left). HEp2/
cDDP cells showed strong resistance to cDDP compared with the
resistance of Hep2 cells. To determine the amount of endogenous
TRIM32 in these cell lines, we performed real-time quantitative
PCR with a human TRIM32-specific probe and immunoblot
analysis with an antibody to TRIM32 (Fig. 6A, right). The mRNA
and protein expression levels of endogenous TRIM32 in HEp2/
cDDP cells were f2.0 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than those
in HEp2 cells. We next infected Hep2 cells with retroviruses
encoding FL AG-TRIM32(W T), TRIM32(DRING) or the
corresponding empty vector (Mock). The resulting cells were
incubated in the presence of cDDP, and then the number of
surviving cells was determined by SRB assay. The results indicated
that TRIM32(WT) increased the ratio of surviving cells, whereas
TRIM32(DRING) decreased the ratio (Fig. 6B). We also performed
the same assay using HEp2 and HEp2/cDDP cells transfected with
si-TRIM32 or si-control and found that knockdown of TRIM32
decreased cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Fig. 6B). To

further confirm the suppression of apoptosis by TRIM32, we
measured sub-G1 peak in the cell cycle and cleaved caspase-3.
TRIM32(WT) decreased sub-G1 peak and the expression of cleaved
caspase-3 compared with Mock, whereas TRIM32(DRING) increased them (Fig. 6C and D). These results suggest that TRIM32 is
likely to have an effect on resistance to anticancer drugs.

Discussion
TRIM32 has been reported to protect keratinocytes against UVBinduced apoptosis by the degradation of Piasy and to play a role in
skin carcinogenesis by increasing cell survival (18). However, head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma commonly occurs in a mucosal
lesion of the nasal cavity, oral cavity, tongue, pharynx, and larynx,
which are not exposed to UVB. In the present study, we identified
Abi2 as a protein that binds to TRIM32, suggesting a novel
mechanism of TRIM32 in carcinogenesis in human head and neck

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (14). July 15, 2008

squamous cell carcinoma. We focused on Abi2 among candidates
detected by yeast-two hybrid screening because it has been reported
that Abi2 suppresses cell growth (23) and that a truncated form
accelerates the tumorigenesis (22). Theses previous reports suggest
that Abi2 functions as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, it has been
reported that Bcr-Abl elicits ubiquitin-dependent degradation of
Abi2 and that a deletion mutant of Bcr-Abl to prevent Abi2
degradation impairs leukemogenesis (27). We showed that overexpression of TRIM32 promoted cell growth and transforming
activity, whereas a mutant of TRIM32 lacking the RING-finger
domain prolonged the half-life of Abi2 and suppressed these
functions. These results suggest that TRIM32 functions as an
oncogene via ubiquitination and degradation of Abi2. It has been
suggested that, whereas Abi2 functions as an adapter protein to
bridge c-Abl and particular substrates (23, 30), Abi2 also regulates
the tertiary structure of c-Abl by forming a complex and stabilizes
the inactive form of c-Abl or blocks access to the substrates of c-Abl

tyrosine kinase (22, 31). According to this hypothesis, when TRIM32
is overexpressed in cells, the free and active forms of c-Abl may
increase due to degradation of Abi2 and thereby promote cell
proliferation and mediate carcinogenesis. However, a colony
formation assay showed that TRIM32 failed to increase the
transforming activity by itself and needed other stimulators, such
as active c-Src for transformation (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, TRIM32
expression was elevated both in tumor tissues and in normal cells at
the mitotic phase (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that overexpression of TRIM32 accelerates cell cycle progression and
enhances cell mitosis and cell growth but that TRIM32 is insufficient
in carcinogenesis. TRIM32 probably functions as a coactivator in
collaboration with other oncogenes in carcinogenesis. However, the
possibility of cell type–specific effects cannot be ruled out, although
the above studies suggest that the oncogenic role of TRIM32 might
be through effects on cell cycle stimulation or transformation, at
least in fibroblasts. The connection to cancer, particularly human

head and neck squamous cell carcinoma remains to be elucidated.
Further study is also needed to determine the relation between
expression of TRIM32 and differentiation in tumors.
Abi2 also has been reported to mediate cell motility (27). Other
Abi family proteins, including Abi1 and Abi3 (NESH), have been
reported to be regulators of cell motility (24–26). Abi1 and Abi3 are
localized at the edge of lamellipodial protrusions and form a
complex with WAVE2. Abi1 promotes cell motility, whereas Abi3
suppresses cell motility. Abi2 has been reported to localize
predominantly in the cytosol (26) and impair cell motility on the
basis of results showing that a deletion mutant of Bcr-Abl lacking
the ability to degrade Abi2 prevented cell migration (27). We also
found that Abi2 was localized in the cytosol of HEp2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1) and that TRIM32 enhanced cell migration,
supporting the results of previous studies regarding Abi2. TRIM32
might induce cell motility via the degradation of Abi2 and mediate
the invasion of tumor cells and distant metastasis. These findings

may contribute new information for elucidation of the activities
and possible roles in cancer of TRIM32. However, in this study, we
did not determine whether the effects of TRIM32 on cell cycle, cell
motility, and apoptosis directly depend on the change in activities
of Abi2. Further studies are needed to clarify the functional
interaction between TRIM32 and Abi2.
Moreover, our study showed that TRIM32 inhibits apoptosis
induced by cDDP in HEp2 cells. Development acquired resistance to
cDDP occurs commonly in patients with relapse and is a major
clinical problem. The mechanism by which cancer cells become
resistant to cDDP is not completely understood, although various
possibilities have been suggested. For example, it is likely that cDDP
is inactivated by thiol-containing molecules, such as glutathione and
metallothionein, which are abundant in cells. An increasing cellular
thiol content and an elevated activity of GST, which is responsible for
the conjugation of cDDP to the thiol molecules, have been reported
in many cDDP-resistant cell lines (32–34). As another possible
mechanism, up-regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter
family called efflux pumps, which decrease the accumulation of
drugs, has been reported (35). In addition, increased DNA repair, due
to an increased level of repair enzymes or DNA-binding proteins

studies to analyze the molecular mechanism involved in cDDP
resistance (38). Our results suggest that TRIM32 contributes to the
acquirement of resistance to cDDP. In conclusion, TRIM32 is a novel
mediator affecting tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to
cDDP, and results of further studies on TRIM32 may be useful for
establishing new chemotherapy for head and neck carcinoma.
