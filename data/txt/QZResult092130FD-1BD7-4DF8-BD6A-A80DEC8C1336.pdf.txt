ABSTRACT
Metastasis is often associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
To understand the molecular mechanisms of this process, we conducted proteomic
analysis of androgen-repressed cancer of the prostate (ARCaP), an experimental
model of metastatic human prostate cancer. The protein signatures of epithelial
(ARCaPE) and mesenchymal (ARCaPM) cells were consistent with their phenotypes.
Importantly, the expression of mini-chromosome maintenance 3 (MCM3) protein, a
crucial subunit of DNA helicase, was significantly higher in ARCaPM cells than that
of ARCaPE cells. This increased MCM3 protein expression level was verified using
Western blot analysis of the ARCaP cell lineages. Furthermore, immunohistochemical
analysis of MCM3 protein levels in human prostate tissue specimens showed elevated
expression in bone metastasis and advanced human prostate cancer tissue samples.
Subcutaneous injection experiments using ARCaPE and ARCaPM cells in a mouse
model also revealed increased MCM3 protein levels in mesenchymal-derived tumors.
This study identifies MCM3 as an upregulated molecule in mesenchymal phenotype
of human prostate cancer cells and advanced human prostate cancer specimens,
suggesting MCM3 may be a new potential drug target for prostate cancer treatment.

to respond to available therapeutics. A mechanistic
understanding of the metastatic cascade can help
identify new treatment strategies, identify patients
with aggressive lesions, and control the dissemination
of cancer cells to other parts of the body to improve
prostate cancer patient survival. Metastasis of tumor
cells to distant sites is believed to involve epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by which immotile
epithelial cells become motile, aggressive, and
metastatic [2]. In prostate cancer, EMT has been

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common nonskin malignancy and a major leading cause of cancer
deaths among men in the Western world. An estimated
180,000 men would be diagnosed with prostate cancer
in 2016 with 26,000 estimated deaths occurring from
the disease in the USA [1]. Most patients who die from
prostate cancer develop lethal castration-resistant or

described as a notable feature of the androgen repressed
prostate cancer (ARCaPE/ARCaPM) cell line model. This
ARCaP prostate cancer cell line not only represents
a relevant EMT model but also mimics the clinical
course of prostate cancer metastasis. The epithelial-like
(ARCaPE) cells are isolated from parental ARCaP cells
and induced to transition to mesenchymal phenotype
(ARCaPM) upon exposure to soluble growth factors
or surrounding skeletal microenvironment [3]. Recent
studies highlight the molecular and behavioral signatures
of this ARCaP EMT model [4, 5]. Understanding the
molecular basis of EMT will provide indispensable
insights into the metastatic process and valuable
prognostic and therapeutic targets.
Minichromosome maintenance proteins encompass
a group of ten factors that function in initiation and
elongation of DNA replication [6]. MCM1 and MCM10
do not belong to this family but also play a role in DNA
synthesis. MCM1 is a transcription factor that can affect
DNA synthesis [7], and MCM10 functions in initiation
of DNA replication [8]. While MCM8 is presumed to
possess a helicase activity during elongation of DNA
replication [9], the role of MCM9 has not yet been
addressed [10]. MCM2-7 are six structurally related
proteins crucial for initiation of DNA replication. During
late M/early G1 phases, inactive MCM2-7 proteins are
recruited to DNA and loaded on replication origins
as a double hexamer to preserve bi-directionality of
replication forks [11, 12]. At this point, the six MCM
subunits associate with other proteins to form the prereplication complex. In S phase, the double hexamer
interacts with the pre-initiation complex proteins and
serves as a part of the replicative helicase unwinding
the DNA and “licensing” the origin to undergo precisely
one replication per one cell cycle round [13]. Recently,
Frigola et al. showed that MCM3 is indispensable
and sufficient to affect recruitment and loading of the
double hexamer on DNA [12]. This MCM subunit is
used as a proliferation marker that can determine tumor
growth propensities. Elevated expression of MCM3 is
also correlated with poor prognosis and more advanced
stages in ovarian cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and
malignant melanoma [14–16]. These findings underscore
the function of MCM3 in cancer progression and
suggest a putative role of this protein in prostate cancer
metastasis.
This study aims to further understand the molecular
mechanisms of prostate cancer metastasis using an
ARCaP cell line EMT model, to find new targets for the
development of more effective treatment strategies, and
to improve clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients.
Biochemical analyses of our EMT model revealed
increased expression of MCM3 upon EMT in the ARCaP
cell line model and in human metastatic prostate tissues.
This finding suggests a pivotal role of MCM3 during EMT
and prostate cancer metastasis.

Protein expression profile in the ARCaP EMT
model
Proteomic analysis was conducted to identify
EMT related changes in protein expression in the ARCaP
human prostate cancer cell line model. A set of 1,152
proteins were identified in ARCaPE and ARCaPM in our
proteomics approach (Supplementary Table 1). Only 64
proteins were differentially expressed between the two
cell lines with a P-value < 0.05 and a fold-change of at
least 1.5 (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 35 proteins
were upregulated and 29 proteins were downregulated
in ARCaPM compared to ARCaPE. A selection of the
proteins with the highest fold-changes is listed in Table
1. Consistent with their respective phenotypes, ARCaPE
expressed significantly higher levels of epithelial markers
such as tight junction protein TJP1 (P = 0.004, -2.69 log2
fold-change; also known as ZO-1) and keratins KRT1 and
KRT8 (P = 0.005, -1.95 log2 fold-change; P = 0.024, -1.32
log2 fold-change, respectively). The ARCaPM upregulated
proteins were predominantly correlated with the
mesenchymal and aggressive phenotype. They expressed
higher levels of vimentin (VIM), matrix metalloproteinase
1 (MMP1) and major vault protein (MVP). The expression
of the mesenchymal marker vimentin was not significant
(P = 0.09, 0.72 log2 fold-change; Supplementary Table 1),
but was in agreement with a previous study of ARCaPE
and ARCaPM (0.85 log2 fold-change) [17]. The elevated
expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 in ARCaPM
(MMP1; P = 0.036, 1.61 log2 fold-change) is consistent
with the functions attributed to this metalloprotease in
prostate cancer progression and metastasis [18]. ARCaPM
showed high levels of major vault protein (MVP or LRP) (P
= 0.002, 1.41 log2 fold-change), a protein that is increased
in advanced prostate cancer and expressed in drug resistant
cell lines and various types of cancers [19, 20].

Pathway analysis of differentially expressed
proteins
To gain mechanistic insight into the underlying
biology of ARCaPE and ARCaPM cells, altered proteins (at
least 1.5 fold higher in either cell line) were input into
GeneGO MetaCore (Thomson Reuters, https://portal.
genego.com/) for pathway analysis, and a number of
pathways were enriched (false discovery rate or FDR <
0.05) (Table 2, Supplementary Table 2). Four of the top
10 pathways were related to cell adhesion and two were
related to cell cycle. One of the significantly altered
pathways was Cell cycle_start of DNA replication in
early S phase (pathway FDR = 0.0060; Table 2), which
included MCM3, MCM6, and MCM7. All of these MCM
family members were differentially and highly expressed
in ARCaPM compared to ARCaPE (Table 1).

cells (Figure 1). These results were validated in vivo
using immunohistochemical analysis of tumors generated
from subcutaneous injection of ARCaPE, ARCaPM, and
ARCaPM-Bone into nude mice (Figure 2). ARCaP M-Bone and
ARCaPM-C2 cells are derived from ARCaPM cell-induced

bone metastatic tissues after two rounds of intracardiac
inoculation of athymic mice [21]. Compared to ARCaPE
tumors, ARCaPM and ARCaPM-Bone tumors displayed
higher levels of MCM3 protein. These data suggest that
MCM3 upregulation is correlated with the increased in
vivo metastatic ability of the ARCaP EMT model.

Additional in vivo validation of MCM3 results
was sought in a small cohort of metastatic human
bone tissue specimens. Consistently, three out of four
human metastatic prostate tissues showed significant
high expression of MCM3 (Figure 2D). To assess the
significance of our ARCaP EMT model for clinical prostate
cancer progression, we evaluated the expression of MCM3
in normal prostate (n = 12), benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH, n = 6), and primary prostate carcinoma tissues (n =
12). MCM3 was observed to be absent in normal prostate,
barely observed in benign tumor, and highly expressed in
late stage prostate cancer (Figure 3). Semi-quantitative
analysis of MCM3 expression in the different human
prostate tissues showed the lowest MCM3 expression
in normal tissue and the highest in high-grade prostate
cancer. There was a significant difference in expression
between normal and cancerous prostate (P = 0.0001), BPH
and cancer (P = 0.01), but not between normal and BPH
(P = 0.0866) (Figure 4). These data further supported our
findings of a positive correlation between elevated MCM3
protein levels and increased aggressiveness of the disease.

While MCM6 was reported to be prognostic marker in
a few malignancies [26], MCM7 is extensively studied
in human prostate cancer tissues and is correlated with
higher propensities for prostate cancer progression,
invasion, and metastasis [27, 28]. We selected MCM3 for
further study based on lack of reports in the literature on
the expression of MCM3 in prostate cancer, and on its
critical importance in the cell cycle. In our proteomics and
Western blotting analyses, MCM3 was upregulated upon
EMT in the ARCaP prostate cancer cell model (Figure 1).
This upregulation corroborated the in vivo investigation
of tumors generated from subcutaneous injection of
ARCaPE, ARCaPM, and ARCaPM-Bone (Figure 2) in nude
mice. To investigate the clinical significance of MCM3 in
human prostate cancer progression, immunohistochemical
analysis was performed on normal human prostate, benign
prostatic hyperplasia, primary prostate cancer, and human
bone metastatic prostate cancer tissues (Figures 2D and
3). In accord with our previous results, expression of
MCM3 was significantly increased in primary tumors
and further upregulated in bone metastases, suggesting a
pivotal role of MCM3 in prostate cancer progression and
metastasis.
In the majority of cases observed in the clinic,
human prostate cancer progression proceeds from an
androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state.
Later stages of advanced human prostate cancer are
either androgen-insensitive or androgen-repressed. One
of the suggested molecular mechanisms that delineates
this androgen-repressed phenotype in our EMT model
is the expression of phosphorylated androgen-induced
proliferation inhibitor (APRIN) in ARCaP cells, as
we reported previously [5]. In the present study, we
hypothesize another plausible mechanism that involves
the interplay of MCM3, MCM7, and androgen receptor
(AR). In our EMT ARCaP model, both MCM3 and
MCM7 proteins of the replicative DNA helicase were
elevated in ARCaPM cells. A recent study indicated that
the C-terminus of MCM3 is crucial for recruitment of
all MCM2-7 proteins to DNA [12]. This MCM3 tail is
required for the loading of the double hexamer on DNA
to “license” replication [6]. Cells lacking MCM3 fail to
proceed into S phase and proliferate. All of these data
suggest MCM3 as an inevitable proliferation marker
affecting DNA synthesis and eventually cell division.
Several pathways and constituent proteins have been
implicated in inducing EMT in cancerous cells. These
pathways are typically active in a number of other
processes that include cell proliferation, but the link
between proliferation-associated proteins like MCM3 and
EMT is not well understood [29]. One possibility is that
the greater the number of proliferating mesenchymal cells
with migratory and invasive phenotype, the more of these
aggressive cells are available to metastasize.
One of the most extensively studied MCM proteins,
MCM7, is part of DNA helicase and is found to interact

DISCUSSION
Despite recent advances in prognosis, diagnosis
and treatment of prostate cancer, development of lethal
skeletal metastases remains a clinical challenge. Current
treatment strategies are directed at patients with localized
prostate carcinomas and offer only modest remission for
those with more aggressive lesions [22]. We urgently need
to understand the mechanisms by which prostate tumor
cells disseminate to distant sites. Given the association of
metastasis with EMT, it stands to reason that dissecting
the molecular signatures of the EMT process will reveal
valuable targets for prostate cancer therapy and clinical
research. We used the ARCaP human prostate cancer
cell lineage as an experimental EMT model of clinical
prostate cancer metastasis [3]. ARCaPE and ARCaPM
cells are derived from genetically identical cells isolated
from the same human prostate cancer patient with bone
metastases [3, 23, 24]. However, they exhibit different
morphology, gene expression profiles and behavioral
characteristics. ARCaPM cells have increased expression of
mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, N-cadherin, and
RANKL; decreased epithelial markers like E-cadherin;
increased proliferation compared to ARCaPE; and higher
propensity for bone metastasis [3, 23, 25]. Conversely,
ARCaPE cells display epithelial morphology with lower
invasion, migration, growth rate, and metastatic potential
[3, 23, 25]. Both ARCaPE and ARCaPM cells are derived
from the parental ARCaP cells which express low levels
of androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen, and are
repressed by androgens [24].
Our study showed elevated expression of three
members of the MCM family of proteins, MCM3, MCM6,
and MCM7, in ARCaPM as compared to ARCaPE cells.

with AR [30]. The interaction between AR and MCM7 is
vital for gene expression or repressor activity of androgen.
This AR/MCM7 complex acts as a co-replication factor
affecting cell proliferation and as a co-transcription factor
controlling the expression of AR-responsive genes. The
availability of androgens inhibits MCM7 expression and
causes cell growth arrest. Conversely, the absence of
androgens results in an AR/MCM7 interaction that induces
the MCM complex to initiate DNA replication [30].
Based on all these findings, we consider that the increased
metastatic potential of ARCaPM cells is partially due to
increased levels of MCM3 and MCM7, because the more
cells proliferate the more cells with EMT phenotype are
available for spreading to other parts of the body. Elevated
MCM3 and MCM7 proteins are speculated to interact with
AR, affecting cell proliferation, migration, and androgen
repression. Whether MCM3 interacts directly or indirectly
with AR remains to be further investigated.
This study sheds light on EMT and metastasis in
human prostate cancer using the ARCaPE/ARCaPM cell
line model and human prostate cancer tissue specimens.
We found an elevated expression of the proliferation
marker MCM3 in ARCaPM compared to ARCaPE cells
and during the progression of prostate cancer from
primary tumor to metastatic disease. This upregulation
is hypothesized to involve an interaction with AR either
directly or indirectly through MCM7. Collectively, our
data suggest a pivotal role of MCM3 in prostate cancer
metastasis and a possible AR-MCM7-MCM3 interaction
that may be responsible for the growth, metastasis, and
androgen-repressed phenotype of late stage human
prostate cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms
and the clinical and pathological parameters of prostate
cancer metastasis is of utmost importance to identify new
therapeutic targets and improve patient outcomes.
