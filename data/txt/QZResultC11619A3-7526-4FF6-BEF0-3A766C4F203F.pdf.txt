Abstract
Androgen ablation during the initial stages of prostate cancer
causes regression of the tumor due to an increase in apoptosis
and reduced cellular proliferation. However, prostate cancer
invariably progresses to an androgen-independent state for
poorly understood reasons. Previous studies showed that c-Jun
NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) is required for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)– and thapsigargin (TG)–induced
apoptosis in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP. Androgens protect LNCaP cells from TPA-induced or
TG-induced apoptosis via down-regulation of JNK activation.
However, the molecular mechanisms of this inhibition are
not clear. Here, we systematically investigated the possible
regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases/
dual-specificity phosphatases during apoptosis of LNCaP
cells and found that Vaccinia H1–related protein (VHR/DUSP3)
is up-regulated by androgens during inhibition of apoptosis
in LNCaP cells, but not in androgen-independent DU145
cells. Ectopic expression of wild-type VHR, but not a
catalytically inactive mutant, interfered with TPA- and
TG-induced apoptosis. Consistently, small interfering RNA–
mediated knockdown of endogenous VHR increased apoptosis
in response to TPA or TG in the presence of androgens. Furthermore, COS7 cells stably expressing wild-type
VHR, but not a mutant, had a decrease in JNK phosphorylation.
In vivo, VHR expression decreased in the androgen-dependent
human prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 upon androgen
withdrawal and was inversely correlated to JNK phosphorylation. Expression analysis in human prostate cancer specimens
showed that VHR is increased in prostate cancer compared with
normal prostate. These data show that VHR has a direct role in
the inhibition of JNK-dependent apoptosis in LNCaP cells and
may therefore have a role in prostate cancer progression.

Introduction
Androgens play an important role in regulating growth,
differentiation, and cell death responses in the normal and
cancerous prostate. The actions of androgens are mediated
through the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily (1–3).

A decrease in circulating androgen levels, by either surgical means
(castration) or through androgen deprivation therapy, results in
decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and atrophy in
prostate epithelial cells (4). However, prostate tumors relapse and
the disease progresses to an androgen-independent state (5). To
date, the molecular mechanisms of transition from androgen
dependence to androgen independence remain poorly understood,
and little is known about the link between androgens and
apoptosis signaling pathways in prostate cancer.
One of the signaling pathways that has been implicated in
prostate carcinogenesis is the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway. The MAPK cascades play an important role in
transducing environmental stimuli to changes in gene expression by
virtue of their ability to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of
various transcription factors and other molecules (6). The MAPK
cascades are composed of three protein kinases that act in series by
activating one another through phosphorylation. A MAPK is
activated by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn is activated
by a MAPKK kinase. In mammals, there are three well-characterized
MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2
terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38
MAPK. The ERK pathway is typically stimulated by growth-related
signals and is mainly involved in growth, differentiation, and
development. p38 MAPK and JNK are activated by growth factors,
proinflammatory cytokines, and cellular stress, and their activation
has been implicated in apoptosis, as well as in oncogenic transformation, inflammation, development, and differentiation (7, 8).
The MAPK pathways can be inactivated by tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and MAPK phosphatases
(MKP)/dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP; ref. 9). These phosphatase families are implicated in the regulation of mitogenic and
other signaling pathways that are mediated by MAPKs. The MKPs,
in contrast to the other two phosphatase families, specifically
dephosphorylate the MAPKs at phosphorylated threonine/serine
and tyrosine residues located in their activation loop (9). To date,
10 typical MKPs have been identified in humans that share the
common CDC25 homology domain but have different subcellular
localization, MAPK affinity, and structure, where determined
(9–11). In addition, there is a group of 19 atypical MKPs, of which
several are MAPK-specific (10). Atypical phosphatases generally
consist of less than 250 amino acid residues and are characterized
by the lack of a CDC25 homology domain. Vaccinia H1–related
protein (VHR) is an atypical MKP (12), which has been shown to
dephosphorylate both ERK and JNK in different cell lines (13–15).
In HeLa cells, VHR regulates cell cycle progression and its
knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest and cell senescence (16).
We have previously shown that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA) and thapsigargin (TG) induce apoptosis in the

androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP through a
mechanism that requires JNK activation (17). Furthermore, we have
shown that androgens protect LNCaP cells from TPA- and
TG-induced apoptosis, which is mediated by down-regulation of
JNK activity (18). Inhibition of JNK activation by androgens was
dependent on AR, androgen dose and time, and required de novo
gene transcription. In the presence of androgens, an increase in
phosphatase activity was observed and the dephosphorylation rate
of JNK was faster than in vehicle-treated LNCaP cells (18). This
suggested that phosphatases, at least in part, may mediate JNKdependent apoptosis. We therefore systematically investigated
possible changes in the expression and regulation of MKPs during
TPA-induced and TG-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells, as well as
during prostate cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The different cell lines were maintained, and treatments
were done as described previously (18, 19).
Xenografts. Transplantation, growth, and harvesting of tumors from
mice bearing CWR22 xenografts were as described previously (20).
Transfection and RNA interference. Transfection of LNCaP cells with
pcDNA3-VHR, pcDNA3-VHR-C124S (generous gifts from John M. Denu;
ref. 14), HA-JNKK2-JNK1 (generous gift from Anning Lin; ref. 21), and pEGFP
were performed using FuGene 6, as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Diagnostics). For obtaining COS7 cells that stably express wild-type
VHR or its mutant, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-VHR or pcDNA3VHR-C124S using FuGene 6. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were plated
in 15-cm dishes, and after an additional 48 h, G418 (500 Ag/mL) was added
to the medium. Outgrowth of single colonies were harvested and expanded
as separate clones. A control cell line was created under similar conditions
using a pcDNA3 vector without insert. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was
used to silence VHR. The siRNA duplex used for targeting human VHR was
(sense strand): 5¶-GGCAGAAGAUGGACGUCAAdTT-3¶ (Dharmacon). A
duplex targeting the luciferase gene was used as a negative control
(Qiagen). siRNA (200 nmol/L) was transfected into LNCaP cells using
Oligofectamine, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Where
indicated, R1881 was added 1 h before siRNA transfection.
Quantitative PCR. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative
PCR (Q-PCR) were as previously described (22). PCR primers used for VHR
were forward 5¶-CGTCTGGCTCAGGACATC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CATTGAGCTGGCAGAGTGG-3¶. A standard curve made from serial dilutions of
cDNA was used to calculate the relative amount of VHR in each sample.
These values were normalized to the relative amount of the internal
standard TBP. Primers used for TBP were forward 5¶-GAATATAATCCCAAGCGGTTTG-3¶ and reverse 5¶-ACTTCATCACAGCTCCCC-3¶. The
experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated thrice. Primers
used for other MKPs tested are available upon request.
Western analysis. Western analysis was carried out as previously
described (18). Antibodies used were against VHR, phJNK, totJNK, phERK,
totERK (all from Cell Signaling), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; Santa Cruz), and a-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). ECL Western blotting
analysis system was used for the detection of the immunoreactive bands
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech).
Immunofluorescence microscopy and TUNEL assay. LNCaP cells
were transfected with the constructs described above. For JNK expression
studies, immunofluorescence microscopy was done as described previously
(18). Ectopic expression of JNK was visualized by an anti-HA antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich). For ectopic expression studies of VHR, cells were
incubated with anti-VHR rabbit antibody (generous gift from John M.
Denu) overnight at 4jC. Cells were then incubated with secondary antibody
Alexa fluor 594–linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h. To detect
apoptosis, an In situ Cell Death Detection kit (TUNEL assay) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics) and as
described previously (18). Cells were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence was observed using an
Axioplan2 imaging microscope (Zeiss), and pictures were taken with an
AxioCam HRc camera (Zeiss). At least three areas and a minimum of 300
cells per area were counted, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was
expressed per 100 of the total number of cells.
Tissue microarray samples. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared
from radical prostatectomy specimens from patients operated at the
Norwegian Radium Hospital between 1988 and 1996 and followed up after
surgery. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements were performed
before and after operation and at every subsequent clinical examination.
Follow-up period ranged from 2 to 176 mo (mean, 73.3 mo). Patients were
considered to have clinically evident recurrence of disease if any of the
following were present: (a) evidence of local recurrence (confirmed by
histologic biopsies or ultrasound) or (b) evidence of distant metastasis
(detected by skeletal scintigraphy and/or magnetic resonance imaging).
If a patient who suffered from relapse had postoperative serum PSA of
>4 ng/mL before the date of either local recurrence or metastasis, the date
of elevated PSA was set as the relapse date (Supplementary Fig. S1).
H&E-stained sections were made from each selected primary tumor
block (donor blocks) of paraffin-embedded material to define representative
tumor regions. With the use of the tissue array instrument (Beecher
Instruments), two tissue cylinders (0.6 mm in diameter) were punched from
regions of the donor block. Control samples of noncancer tissue from the
paraffin blocks were also taken. Gleason score used in the analysis was the
highest Gleason score in each of the prostatectomy series.
Immunohistochemistry. Imunohistochemistry analysis was done as
described previously (22). An anti-VHR rabbit polyclonal antibody
(Cell Signaling) was used. Scoring was essentially identical to as previously
reported (19). SPSS 15.0 software was used for statistical analysis. MannWhitney test was applied to compare the expression level of VHR between
normal and malignant tissues. For correlating VHR intensity to Gleason
score, linear logistic regression was used, and for univariate survival
analysis, a log-rank test was performed together with Kaplan-Meier graphs.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test,
unless indicated otherwise. Values of P < 0.05 were considered as
significant.

Results
Expression and regulation of MKPs during apoptosis of
LNCaP cells. To determine if MKPs are involved in androgenmediated inhibition of JNK-dependent apoptosis in LNCaP cells, we
used Q-PCR to assess possible changes in the expression levels of
the MKP family members in cells treated with TPA and TG in the
presence or absence of the synthetic androgen R1881. As shown in
Table 1, MKP expression was differentially regulated in response to
these agents (detailed data for two MKPs, VH3 and MKP6, are
presented in Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the possible
androgen regulation of most MKPs was checked (Table 1). In most
cases, R1881 alone induced the expression of various MKPs and
addition of TPA or TG increased this further. Among the MKPs
tested, VHR, MKP1, VH3, and MKP6 were most consistent in
displaying significant changes in expression in response to both
TPA and TG, as well as androgen treatment. Both MKP1 and VHR
effectively dephosphorylate JNK (14, 23), whereas VH3 is not
specific for JNK (24), and MKP6 has not been studied in detail
previously. We therefore chose to analyze VHR in further detail.
VHR mRNA accumulation was significantly increased upon TPA
+ R1881 treatment compared with TPA alone at all time points
tested (Fig. 1A). There was also a modest up-regulation of VHR in
response to R1881 alone. Similarly, VHR was significantly upregulated by TG + R1881 treatment compared with TG alone.
However, at later time points, this effect was lost (Fig. 1B). These
data indicate that VHR mRNA expression is increased during
R1881-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.

VHR in Prostate Cancer

To assess whether VHR protein was similarly regulated, whole
cell extracts were made from cells treated with TPA or TG in the
presence or absence of R1881 and examined by Western blot
analysis. VHR protein was increased in response to TPA + R1881
and TG + R1881 compared with TPA or TG alone consistent with
the mRNA expression data presented above (Fig. 1C and D).
Interestingly, although no significant regulation of VHR mRNA
expression was observed in long time points with TG treatment,
VHR protein levels were increased at these times, indicating that
the action of androgen on VHR expression involves both VHR
mRNA and protein. These data indicate that VHR may have an
essential role in the inhibition of JNK-dependent apoptosis in
LNCaP cells.
To investigate if the increase in VHR expression upon TPA or TG
treatment in the presence of R1881 is specific for androgenresponsive LNCaP cells, the androgen-independent cell line DU145
was used. Cells were treated as before, and VHR protein expression
was investigated (Supplementary Fig. S3). VHR protein levels were
slightly increased in response to R1881 compared with vehicletreated cells, but there was no increase in expression in cells
treated with TPA or TG in the presence of R1881. These data
indicate that induction of VHR expression is dependent on intact
androgen signaling.
Ectopic expression of VHR protects LNCaP cells from TPAinduced and TG-induced apoptosis. The data presented above
suggested that up-regulation of VHR can down-regulate JNK
activation and thereby prevent apoptosis in LNCaP cells. To assess
this possibility, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with
expression vectors specifying wild-type VHR, the catalytically
inactive mutant, VHR-C124S, or with an expression vector for
green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) as a control. The cells were
grown in the presence or absence of R1881, and apoptosis was
induced with TPA or TG. At the indicated times, the cells were fixed
and incubated with VHR antibody and TUNEL assay was

performed. Whereas wild-type VHR expression inhibited apoptosis
induced by both TPA and TG, the mutant VHR had largely lost this
ability (Fig. 2). For example, wild-type VHR inhibited TPA-induced
apoptosis by >95% at 24 hours, but inhibition by mutant VHR was
only 50% (Fig. 2B). Similarly, whereas wild-type VHR inhibited
f90% of apoptosis induced by TG, inhibition by the mutant VHR
was only 35% (Fig. 2C). The effect of mutant VHR in decreasing
apoptosis, albeit significantly less than wild-type VHR, could be due
to the possibility that it can still bind and sequester JNK through
JNK-interacting protein-1, thereby blocking its activation, as has
been shown for two other MKPs (25). In parallel to the TUNEL
assay, DAPI staining and changes in nuclear morphology and
nuclear fragmentation were also used to assess apoptosis and
virtually identical results were obtained (data not shown). The
same experiment was also performed in the presence of R1881, and
similar results were obtained, except for lower levels of total cell
death (data not shown). In summary, these data show that VHR
inhibits apoptosis in LNCaP cells.
Knockdown of VHR increases cell death induced by TPA and
TG in R1881-treated LNCaP cells. The data presented above
suggested that VHR inhibits apoptosis induced by TPA and TG in
LNCaP cells. If this is the case, knockdown of VHR should have the
opposite effect, namely, increased apoptosis. To assess this, we
used a siRNA that efficiently knocks down VHR (16). LNCaP cells
were transfected with siRNA directed against luciferase as a control
or the siRNA for VHR. A significant reduction in both VHR mRNA
and protein expression was observed in cells transfected with VHR
siRNA compared with luciferase siRNA that lasted at least up to
96 hours, both in the presence or absence of R1881 (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
To investigate the effect of VHR knockdown on apoptosis,
TUNEL assays were performed on LNCaP cells transfected with
siRNA targeting luciferase or VHR. Cells were treated with R1881 or
vehicle for 40 hours before addition of TPA or TG for the indicated

Figure 1. mRNA and protein expression levels of VHR in LNCaP cells treated with TPA or TG in the presence or absence of R1881. LNCaP cells were pretreated

times. As expected, there was an increase in apoptosis in response
to TPA compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3A). However, the
extent of apoptosis was decreased in cells treated with R1881 plus
luciferase siRNA, and this decrease was significantly reversed in the
presence of VHR siRNA (Fig. 3A). Quantification indicated that the
inhibitory action of R1881 on TPA-induced apoptosis was partially
reversed when VHR levels were decreased, indicating that R1881
inhibition of apoptosis in LNCaP cells, at least in part, is mediated
by VHR (Fig. 3B).
Essentially, the same results were obtained with TG (Fig. 3C
and D). In fact, at 36 hours of TG treatment, knockdown of VHR
almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of R1881 on TGmediated apoptosis. At 48 hours of TG treatment, there was still a
significant effect of VHR knockdown, but the reversal of the R1881
effect was not complete.
In parallel to the TUNEL assays, DAPI staining was performed as
an independent measure of apoptosis under these conditions, and
similar results were obtained (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S5A
and B). Coupled to the results presented above with ectopic
expression of VHR, these data show that VHR has a direct role in
the inhibition of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.
Stable expression of VHR leads to a decrease in JNK
phosphorylation. To investigate if VHR has a role in specific
dephosphorylation of JNK activated by TPA or TG, COS7 cell lines
that stably express either an empty vector or expression vectors
specifying wild-type VHR or VHR-C124S mutant were generated.
The cells were treated with TPA, TG, or vehicle for the indicated
times, and the phosphorylation status of JNK and ERK was
investigated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Quantification of
these blots indicated a significant decrease in JNK phosphorylation
for all the treatments in cells expressing wild-type VHR but not in
cells expressing mutant VHR or empty vector (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, VHR did not affect ERK signaling as a significant decrease in
phERK was only observed in cells expressing empty vector (Fig. 4B).
These results indicate that under the conditions in which it blocks
apoptosis, VHR specifically inactivates JNK but not ERK, which

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

further suggests that JNK inhibition by VHR is linked to inhibition
of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.
To further assess the role of JNK in inhibition of apoptosis under
conditions where VHR is up-regulated, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with JNKK2-JNK1 (MKK7-JNK1), which encodes
a hybrid JNK molecule that is constitutively active (21). Transfected
cells were either left untreated or treated with R1881, and apoptosis
was assessed using the TUNEL assay. LNCaP cells that express
JNKK2-JNK1 underwent significant apoptosis (33%) when treated
with vehicle, confirming the direct role of active JNK in apoptosis
in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4C and D). Furthermore, the apoptosisinducing effect of JNKK2-JNK1 was almost completely lost upon
androgen treatment (Fig. 4C and D). This suggests that VHR and
possibly other MKPs that are up-regulated by R1881 can reverse
apoptosis induced by JNK.
Androgen withdrawal decreases VHR expression in human
prostate cancer xenografts. As androgens have a protective effect
on prostate cancer and R1881 increases VHR expression in LNCaP
cells, we investigated the expression of VHR, as well as phJNK, in
the human androgen-dependent prostate cancer xenograft CWR22.
These tumors regress markedly after castration due to a decrease
in growth and an increase in apoptosis (20, 26). Western blot
analysis of whole cell extracts made from CWR22 tumors collected
from mice at different times after castration showed that VHR
expression had an initial increase at 1 week, which significantly
decreased by 2 weeks and continued to decline at 4 weeks (Fig. 5A).
There was no difference in VHR expression in noncastrated mice at
the same time points (Supplementary Fig. S6). This indicates that
VHR is regulated by androgens in vivo, and its expression is
inversely correlated to apoptosis and tumor regression. In contrast,
phJNK levels significantly increased upon castration reaching
3.5-fold higher levels at 4 weeks after castration compared with
t = 0, whereas totJNK levels did not significantly change (Fig. 5A).
In noncastrated mice, there were no differences in phJNK levels at
the same time points (Supplementary Fig. S6). These data show
that VHR and phJNK expressions are inversely correlated to each

VHR in Prostate Cancer

other and differentially correlated to apoptosis. At 4 weeks after
castration, there was a shift in the apparent molecular weight of
VHR that could indicate a posttranslational modification, e.g.,
phosphorylation changes as suggested previously (27); this requires
further investigation. Altogether, these results show that VHR
expression is regulated by androgens, is inversely related to phJNK
expression, and, thus, is associated with apoptosis of prostate
cancer cells in vivo.
VHR expression is up-regulated in human prostate cancer
samples. As for other cancer types, prostate tumors are resistant to
apoptosis (1, 28). Based on the data presented above, we
hypothesized that VHR may play a role in the inhibition of cell
death in prostate cancer tissue and, therefore, may be differentially
expressed during prostate cancer progression. Comparison of gene
expression profiles from a diverse array of normal tissues showed
that VHR mRNA expression is significantly higher in normal
prostate compared with 21 other tissues (Fig. 5B). We also

examined gene expression profiles during prostate cancer progression and found that VHR mRNA expression was significantly
increased in metastatic prostate cancer compared with prostate
carcinoma tissues of different grades (Fig. 5C; ref. 29).
To determine if similar changes in expression are present at the
protein level, we examined VHR expression by immunohistochemical analysis on TMAs that contained normal (n = 14) and
malignant prostate tissue (n = 74). The TMAs included samples
representing various stages of prostate cancer progression and
normal prostate glands. VHR protein was expressed in normal
prostate tissue, solely in epithelial cells with predominantly nuclear
but also some cytosolic localization (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, its
expression was significantly increased in cancer tissue compared
with normal cells (Fig. 5D; P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). Intensity
scoring among different tumor grades (Gleason score) indicated no
differences (data not shown; P = 0.393, linear logistic regression).
Similarly, survival was not associated with VHR expression

(data not shown). Together, these data show that VHR expression is
increased at both the mRNA and protein levels in prostate cancer
compared with normal prostate with no significant correlation
with well-differentiated or poorly differentiated tumors at the
protein level.

Discussion
MAPK signaling pathways have been implicated in diverse
cellular processes, such as differentiation and apoptosis. To
regulate these cellular responses, the activity of MAPKs must be
strictly regulated; this can be achieved by regulating either their
activation or inhibition, i.e., their phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, respectively. Whereas there has been keen focus on
pathways that activate the MAPKs, until recently, there has been
relatively little research on the phosphatases that inactivate them.
To assess the possible role of MKPs in prostate carcinogenesis, we
carried out a comprehensive expression analysis of the MKP family
during apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.
The MKPs tested were regulated differently in prostate cancer
cells in response to the different compounds. In the presence of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

R1881 there was a greater effect of TPA on MKP expression than of
TG, which could be due to the different pathways that these
compounds affect. One of the MKPs that was regulated, VHR, was
of special interest to us because it was previously shown to
effectively dephosphorylate JNK (14), which is required for
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (17, 18).
VHR was significantly up-regulated at both mRNA and protein
levels that coincided with the inhibition of apoptosis by R1881 in
LNCaP cells. R1881 alone increased VHR expression in LNCaP cells
but not in androgen-independent DU145 cells. Consistently, after
an initial increase, VHR levels decreased in androgen-dependent
CWR22 xenografts after androgen withdrawal in vivo. The effect of
androgens on the inhibition of JNK activation has been studied
previously by bicalutamide treatment or siRNA-mediated knockdown of AR in LNCaP cells, which showed that AR-dependent
transcriptional activity is required for this process (18). Bioinformatics analysis of the VHR gene and 2-kb upstream flanking region
indicated that there are at least two putative androgen response
elements that may mediate the effects of androgens on VHR
expression by direct interactions with AR (data not shown).

VHR in Prostate Cancer

Androgen treatment of LNCaP cells was previously suggested
to be required for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)–
induced apoptosis and the synthesis of protein kinase Cy (PKCy;
ref. 30). However, this study used low passage LNCaP cells (2–8),
had shorter R1881 and PMA treatment times, and the effect of
R1881 on PKCy expression was lost already after 12 hours. In
our experimental system, longer times of treatment with both
R1881 and TPA are required to see the effects on apoptosis,
which could affect PKCy expression differently with a different
outcome on apoptosis. In another study, androgens facilitated
TPA-induced apoptosis, wherein the nuclear factor-nB signaling
pathway was interrupted and JNK was activated (31). However,
once again, the treatment times and conditions with DHT and
TPA were different from our experimental conditions. Further
work is required to determine the mechanistic basis of these
differences.

In response to different treatments, there were inconsistencies
between the VHR mRNA and protein expression levels. For
example, TPA increased VHR mRNA expression of f2.5-fold by 4
hours, but the effect was smaller at the protein level. In response to
TG, there was also an increase in VHR mRNA levels, but this did
not exceed 1.5-fold at the mRNA level and was even smaller at the
protein level. Of note is the 12-hour time point where the basal
level of VHR mRNA expression was significantly lower than at
other time points. However, this did not translate into changes in
VHR protein levels. At present, the molecular mechanisms that are
responsible for these observations are not clear. Because TPA and
TG are known to affect multiple signaling pathways, it is possible
that distinctly different components of these pathways converge
upon VHR expression, depending on the compound. Furthermore,
in the AR-positive cell line CWR22Rv1, there was no effect of TPA
or TG on VHR expression in the presence or absence of R1881 (data

Figure 5. VHR expression analysis in human prostate cancer xenograft CWR22, as well as in normal and malignant human prostate tissue samples. A, CWR22
xenografts were grown in nude mice, and tumors were collected at different times after castration. PSA levels dramatically dropped upon castration, indicating the
success of the process and regression of the tumor (Supplementary Fig. S7). Whole cell protein extracts were made and used for Western blot analysis. Representative
blots for VHR, phJNK, totJNK, and GAPDH. VHR and phJNK levels were normalized to GAPDH and totJNK levels, respectively. For GAPDH and totJNK, the values at
t = 0 are set to 1. B, large-scale analysis of the human transcriptome by gene expression profiling of samples of a diverse array of tissues, organs, and cell lines.
Data were obtained from the Oncomine database (29). Prostate tumors were profiled to identify overexpressed genes. Samples of different human tissue samples used
in this analysis were obtained from commercial resources and research collaborations, as described by Su and colleagues (48, 49). Twenty-one tissues (n = 68), other
than prostate (n = 3), were analyzed for VHR expression. C, from 44 individuals with different histories of prostate disease as described by Tomlins and colleagues (50),
101 laser capture microdissected cell populations from a progression of prostate cancer cell types (PIN, low-grade prostate cancer, high-grade prostate cancer,
metastatic prostate cancer) were analyzed with a microarray chip. Prostate carcinoma, n = 30; metastatic prostate cancer, n = 19. *, P < 0.001 indicates significant
difference. D, TMAs with normal and tumor glands from human prostate were stained with the VHR antiserum, as described in Materials and Methods. VHR expression
was predominantly observed in the nuclei of the prostate epithelium, with significantly stronger staining in tumor glands. Representative images are shown. The intensity
of staining (score, 0–3) in the TMAs was scored by a pathologist and is shown in the table for normal and cancerous prostate glands.

not shown). This could be due to the androgen-insensitive features
of these cells, due to, at least in part, a lack of the ligand-binding
domain of AR in these cells (32).
Under conditions wherein VHR is up-regulated, there was a
significant decrease in apoptosis induced by the constitutively
active JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein (Fig. 4C and D). This suggests
that the inhibitory effect of androgen on apoptosis is at the level of
JNK and/or downstream from it. The ability of VHR to specifically
dephosphorylate JNK (Fig. 4A and B) and the correlation of this to
the inhibition of apoptosis in LNCaP cells (Figs. 2 and 3) suggests
that JNK is the target of the androgen effect. However, the lack of
full activity of VHR in reversing apoptosis suggested that other
signaling pathways may also be involved. First, VHR may work in
concert with other MKPs, as indicated by the data presented in
Table 1. Second, it is possible that other MAPK pathways are

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

implicated, which may be differentially regulated by VHR and other
MKPs. However, ERK and p38 MAPK inhibitors had no effect on
androgen-induced inhibition of JNK phosphorylation. Consistently,
there was no increase in the activity of these two pathways in
response to androgen treatment, indicating that they are not
involved in this process (18). Other arms of the MAPK pathways
and their regulation by VHR and other MKPs may play a role in this
regard. Third, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
kinase B pathway, which is critical for cell survival in prostate
cancer cells (18, 33), may be involved. We have, thus far, found no
increase in Akt activation in response to R1881 in LNCaP cells (data
not shown). Consistently, PI3K inhibition did not have an effect on
the androgen-dependent block of JNK activation, suggesting that
the PI3K pathway is not involved. Fourth, sustained ROS
accumulation can trigger JNK activation through the inactivation

VHR in Prostate Cancer

of MKPs (34), suggesting that inhibition of ROS accumulation could
be responsible for the inhibition of JNK activation by androgens in
LNCaP cells, perhaps through affecting MKP activity. However, ROS
levels in LNCaP cells increased in response to R1881, consistent
with previously published data (18, 35). However, this was not
inhibited under conditions where JNK activation was blocked by
R1881 when VHR levels were increased (data not shown). These
data suggest that regulation of VHR or other MKPs by ROS levels is
not a mechanism for inhibition of apoptosis by androgens in
LNCaP cells.
Some previous studies have investigated the possible role of
MKPs in carcinogenesis. A recent study on MKP8/DUSP26, which is
closely related to VHR, suggested that it acts as an oncogene in
anaplastic thyroid cancer (36). The MKP8 gene was found to be
amplified with consequently increased expression and promoted
cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis (36). Furthermore,
several studies showed that MKP1 is overexpressed and associated
with tumorigenicity in ovarian (37), breast (38), and pancreatic
cancer (39). In other studies, MKP1 promoted cell survival by
attenuating stress-responsive MAPK-mediated apoptosis (23, 40).
MKP2/DUSP4 was also shown to be overexpressed in human breast
cancer (38). Furthermore, a recent study showed that the
expression of DUSP22/DUSP2, closely related to VHR, is increased
after estradiol treatment in breast cancer cells (41). DUSP22 was
found to negatively regulate estrogen receptor a activity and cell
survival but positively regulated AR activity. In addition, VHR was
recently found to be up-regulated in cervical carcinoma and in
cervical cancer cell lines (42).
There is limited data about the possible biological roles of MKPs
in prostate cancer. One study showed that overexpression of MKP1
in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145
blocked activation of JNK that inhibited Fas ligand-induced
apoptosis (43). Another study found that overexpression of
MKP5/DUSP10 reduced the invasion of a highly metastatic
prostate cancer cell line by dephosphorylating p38 MAPK (44).
Furthermore, previous studies have shown that MKP1 is overexpressed in high-grade PIN compared with normal prostate and that
the proportion of apoptosis is significantly lower in PIN lesions
expressing MKP1 (45). In addition, JNK1 enzymatic activity was
inversely related to MKP1 levels (45, 46). These data, along with the

data that we present here involving VHR, suggest that MKPs may
have an important role in prostate cancer biology.
Consistent with its effects on prostate cancer cells in vitro, VHR
expression is significantly increased in human prostate cancer
compared with normal prostate. Whereas there was no correlation between VHR expression and tumor grade, at the mRNA level
VHR expression was increased in metastatic prostate cancer
compared with prostate carcinoma. Cancer and its metastases are
known to have decreased potential to undergo apoptosis and are
resistant to extracellular death signals (47). The role of VHR in
inhibiting apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro that we have
shown here may, therefore, also apply to prostate cancer in situ.
This is supported by the significant down-regulation of VHR
concomitant with phJNK expression during androgen ablation–
induced regression of human prostate cancer xenograft CWR22
(Fig. 5A), which is known to occur, at least in part, by an
apoptotic pathway (26).
In summary, these data suggest that knockdown of VHR in
prostate cancer may result in the activation of JNK, leading to
apoptosis, and may therefore have therapeutic utility in the clinic.
This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that prostate is the tissue
where VHR is most highly expressed among 21 normal tissues tested
(Fig. 5B). VHR inactivation may, therefore, be a unique approach to
sensitize prostate cancer to cell death in combination with
conventional cancer chemotherapeutic strategies.
