a Tumor-Specific Immune Response

Abstract
Immunogenic cell death is characterized by the early surface exposure of chaperones including
calreticulin and HSPs, which affect dendritic cell (DC) maturation and the uptake and presentation of
tumor antigens. It has also been shown that it is characterized by the late release of high mobility group box
1 (HMGB1), which acts through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and augments the presentation of antigens from
dying tumor cells to DCs. Most of the data on immunogenic tumor cell death were obtained using mouse
models. In this study, we investigated the capacity of clinically used chemotherapeutics to induce
immunogenic cell death in human tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells. We found that only
anthracyclines induced a rapid translocation of calreticulin, HSP70, and HSP90 to the cell surface and
the release of HMGB1 12 hours after the treatment. The interaction of immature DCs with immunogenic
tumor cells led to an increased tumor cell uptake and induces moderate phenotypic maturation of DCs.
Killed tumor cell–loaded DCs efficiently stimulated tumor-specific IFN-g–producing T cells. DCs pulsed
with killed immunogenic tumor cells also induced significantly lower numbers of regulatory T cells than
those pulsed with nonimmunogenic tumor cells. These data indicate that human prostate cancer, ovarian
cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells share the key features of immunogenic cell death with mice
tumor cells. These data also identify anthracyclines as anticancer drugs capable of inducing immunogenic
cell death in sensitive human tumor cells. Cancer Res; 71(14); 4821–33. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer affects half of the inhabitants of developed countries and kills one third of them. Primary tumors can often
be completely removed with current cancer therapeutic
modalities; however, micrometastases of dormant tumor
cells frequently lead to the establishment of the distant
metastases and to the relapse of the disease (1). In addition
to the standard treatment of metastatic disease by combinations of chemotherapeutics, it would be beneficial for
cancer patients to elicit a tumor-specific immunity that
would control or slow the growth of residual tumor cells.
A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapeutic
strategies aiming to induce tumor-specific immunity represents a challenging task because chemotherapy is generally
considered to be immunosuppressive. Physiologic cell death
by apoptosis is known to be nonimmunogenic or tolerogenic

(2). Consequently, phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells has
been long considered to be immunologically silent (3).
However, recent studies have shown that tumor cells killed
by some chemotherapeutics, such as bortezomib (4, 5),
oxaliplatin (6), and anthracyclines (7), can induce a
tumor-specific immune response. This immunogenic cell
death is characterized by molecular events shared for all
described chemotherapeutics. Anthracyclines have a major
role in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, and
uterine, ovarian, and breast malignancies. Despite their side
effects, anthracyclines (8) are able to induce immunogenic
cell death in mouse tumor cells. Within hours after the
initiation of immunogenic cell death, preapoptotic tumor
cells translocate calreticulin (CRT; refs. 9, 10) and HSPs from
the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface together with
other molecules that serve as "eat me" signals (phosphatidylserine). At the same time, tumor cells undergoing immunogenic tumor cell death downregulate the expression of
"don't eat me" signals, such as surface CD47, to facilitate
tumor cell recognition and engulfment by dendritic cells
(DC; ref. 11). In addition, following permeabilization of the
plasma membrane, cells release the late apoptosis marker
high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1; ref. 12) into the extracellular milieu. HMGB1 can bind several pattern recognition
receptors (PRR), such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4 (8,
13), and receptor for advanced glycosylation end products
(RAGE). The release of this protein seems to be required

for optimal presentation of antigens from dying tumor cells,
T-cell priming by DCs, and subsequent T-cell–mediated
elimination of the tumor.
All these findings were obtained using mouse models, and it
is thus important to determine whether immunogenic tumor
cell death can also be induced in humans and whether similar
molecular events also occur in human cancer cells. Here, we
report that anthracyclines are able to induce the expression of
several immunogenic molecules on the surface of a wide
spectrum of primary and secondary human cancer cell lines
(leukemia, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer), in contrast to
other tested chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation, which
is often used in immunotherapeutic protocols. The uptake of
anthracycline-killed human tumor cells by DCs leads to the
stimulation of the T-cell response and the induction of antitumor immunity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were kindly provided by Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague (CLIP;
REH, HLA-A2 positive; DSMZ). Ovarian cancer cells [OV90,
HLA-A2 positive; American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC)], prostate cancer cells (LNCap, HLA-A2 positive;
ATCC). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Gibco). All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Lonza), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 2 mmol/L Lglutamine.
Isolation of primary tumor cells
Primary ovarian cancer cells were obtained from patients
undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. The resected tumors
were weighed, minced into small pieces (1–3 mm), and
mechanically minced into smaller pieces in PBS þ 2 mmol/
L EDTA. The portions of tumor were then placed in gentleMACS C tubes in 10 mL PBS þ 2 mmol/L EDTA or an enzyme
solution (Collagenase D), placed into the incubator (37 C) for
30 minutes and then mixed again twice. The cell suspension
was mashed through a sterile cell strainer (100 mm). The cell
suspension was washed in PBS þ 2 mmol/L EDTA at least
twice by centrifugation. The tumor cells were isolated by Ficoll
100% gradient centrifugation. Primary ovarian cancer cells
(80%–95% purity) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(FCS)/glutamine/penicillin.
Apoptosis induction and detection
Tumor cell death was induced by UV (UVA) light exposure (7 and 6 J/cm2). Cell death was assessed by Annexin
V/fluorescein isothiocyanate staining. Briefly, 2  105 cells
per sample were collected, washed in PBS, pelleted, and
resuspended in an incubation buffer containing Annexin
V/fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. The samples were
kept in the dark and incubated for 15 minutes before the
addition of another 400 mL of 0.1% propidium iodide (PI)
incubation buffer and subsequent analysis on a FACSAria
flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) using FlowJo software.

Flow cytometric analysis of HSP70, HSP90, and CRT on
the cell surface
A total of 105 cells were plated on 12-well plates and treated
the following day with the indicated agents or were UVirradiated for 6, 12, or 24 hours. The cells were collected
and washed twice with PBS. The cells were incubated for 30
minutes with primary antibody diluted in cold blocking buffer
(2% FBS in PBS), followed by washing and incubation with
the Alexa 648–conjugated monoclonal secondary antibody
in a blocking solution. Each sample was then analyzed by a
FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) to identify cell
surface HSP70, HSP90, and CRT.
Detection of HMGB1 release
REH cells, OV90 cells, LNCap cells, primary ovarian cells,
and leukemic blasts (106) were plated in 1 mL full medium
appropriate for the cell type. Supernatants were collected at
different time points, dying tumor cells were removed by
centrifugation, and the supernatants were isolated and frozen
immediately. Quantification of HMGB1 in the supernatants
was assessed by ELISA according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Fluorescent microscopy
For surface detection of CRT, the cells were placed on ice,
washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 minutes. The cells were then washed twice
in PBS, and a primary antibody diluted in cold blocking
buffer was added for 30 minutes. After 2 washes in cold
PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 minutes with the
appropriate Alexa 648–conjugated secondary antibody.
The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
minutes, washed in PBS for 20 minutes, and mounted on
slides.
For phagocytosis, the DCs were stained with Vybrant DiO
cell labeling solution (Invitrogen). The tumor cells were
stained with Vybrant DiI cell labeling solution (Invitrogen)
and cultured in the presence of selected cytostatic agents or
UV radiation for 24 hours. Immature DCs (day 5) were fed
tumor cells at a DC/tumor cell ratio of 1:5. The cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, washed in PBS for
20 minutes, and mounted on slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen).
Generation of tumor-loaded DCs and induction of
tumor cell death
DCs were generated by culture of purified CD14þ cells
isolated from buffy coats in the presence of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Gentaur)
and interleukin-4 (IL-4; Gentaur; ref. 14). Tumor cells were
killed by culturing in the presence of a selected cytostatic
agent (100 nmol/L) or by UV irradiation for 24 hours. The
extent of apoptosis was monitored by Annexin V/PI staining.
The cells were extensively washed before feeding to DCs.
Immature DCs (day 5) were fed tumor cells at a DC/tumor
cell ratio of 1:5. In some experiments, pulsed DCs were
stimulated with 100 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma)
for 12 hours.

Immunogenic Cell Death in Human Tumor Cells

Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis of DC
phenotype after interaction with killed tumor cells
The phenotype of DCs cultured with tumor cells was
monitored by flow cytometry (15, 16). Tumor cells were killed
by a selected cytostatic agent or by UV irradiation and were
cocultured for 24 hours with immature DCs. For some experiments, the DCs and tumor cells were dye labeled before
coculture to monitor phagocytosis. Monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) against the following molecules were used: CD80A700 (Exbio), CD83-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BioLegend), CD86-A647
(BioLegend), CD14-PE (Exbio), CD11c-APC (Exbio), and
HLA-DR PC7 (BD Biosciences).
The DCs were stained for 30 minutes at 4 C, washed twice
in PBS, and analyzed using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) using FlowJo software. The DCs were gated
according to the forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) properties. The appropriate isotype controls were included, and
50,000 viable DCs were acquired for each experiment.
Evaluation of IFN-g–producing tumor-specific T cells
Unpulsed or tumor-loaded DCs were added to autologous T
cells at a ratio of 1:10 on days 0 and 7 of culture. IL-2 (25–50 IU/
mL; PeproTech) was added on days 2 and 7 of culture. The
cultures were tested for the presence of tumor-specific T cells
7 to 9 days after the last stimulation with DCs. The induction
of tumor-reactive, IFN-g–producing T cells by tumor-loaded
DCs was determined by flow cytometry. The T cells were
stained with anti-human CD8/IFN-g (17).

Results
We first tested the cytotoxic effect of a wide spectrum of
clinically used cytostatic agents on the viability of REH (TALL), ovarian cancer (OV90), and prostate (DU145) cancer cell
lines. The viability of tumor cells was repeatedly analyzed over
the course of 48 hours by PI and Annexin V staining. Cytostatic
agents that killed more than 50% of tumor cells after 24 hours
were used for subsequent experiments to analyze the capacity
of these agents to induce an immunogenic cell death (Fig. 1).
Expression of immunogenic cell death markers HSP70,
HSP90, and calreticulin by human cancer cell lines and
human primary tumor cells
Cytostatics were tested for their ability to induce the
expression of the known immunogenic cell death markers
HSP70, HSP90, and calreticulin in leukemic, ovarian, and
prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumor cells. Significant
expression of HSP70, HSP90, and calreticulin on T-ALL leukemia cells and T-ALL leukemic cells was detected 12 and 24
hours after the treatment with anthracyclines (doxorubicin
and idarubicin; Fig. 2A and B). Increased expression of HSP70,
HSP90, and calreticulin after the treatment with anthracyclines was accompanied by their translocation to the cell
surface (Fig. 2C). The anthracyclines also induced significant
upregulation of HSP70, HSP90, and calreticulin in the OV90
ovarian cancer cell line, in primary ovarian cancer cells freshly
isolated from resected tumors, and in the DU145 prostate
cancer cell line (Fig. 2D). We did not observe any significant

www.aacrjournals.org

upregulation of immunogenic cell death markers on ovarian,
prostate, and ALL human tumor cells after UV light exposure.
Anthracyclines induce HMGB1 secretion in human
T-ALL, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer cells
We analyzed the release of a late-stage marker of immunogenic cell death HMGB1 in the supernatants of T-ALL, ovarian,
and prostate cancer cell lines and primary T-ALL and ovarian
tumor cells. Of the tested drugs, only anthracyclines induced
significant release of HMGB1 in all tested human tumor cells
(Fig. 3). Maximal release of HMGB1 nuclear protein was
detected 24 hours after the induction of tumor cell death.
Anthracycline treatment increases the rate of
phagocytosis of killed tumor cells by DCs
For the functional studies, we tested only the T-ALL cell
line, as it was more feasible to work with the cells in suspension. In view of the established role of calreticulinas an "eat
me" signal, we first investigated the rate of phagocytosis of
cytostatic-treated REH tumor cells by DCs. Anthracyclinetreated tumor cells were phagocytosed at faster rate and to a
higher extent than the tumor cells killed by other cytostatic
agents. After 12 hours, the rate of phagocytosis of leukemic
cells treated with anthracyclines was 3-fold higher than that of
cells killed by UV irradiation or other tested drugs. The
difference was even higher after 24 hours, especially for
idarubicin-treated tumor cells (Fig. 4). The rate of phagocytosis closely correlated with the intensity of calreticulin
expression and, although to a lesser degree, with the intensity
of HSP70 and HSP90 expression (Fig. 4D).
Phagocytosis of anthracycline-treated tumor cells
induces the expression of maturation-associated
molecules on DCs
The ability of DCs to activate the immune response depends
on their maturation status and the expression of costimulatory molecules. We analyzed the phenotype of DCs that
phagocytosed REH tumor cells killed by the indicated cytostatic agents or UV irradiation. The interaction of DCs with
idarubicin- and doxorubicin-treated T-ALL cells induced the
upregulation of CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR, although to a
smaller extent than activation by LPS (Fig. 5). Activation of
DCs with anthracycline-killed tumor cells and LPS together
induced comparable expression of costimulatory molecules as
treatment with LPS alone (data not shown).
DCs pulsed with anthracycline-treated tumor cells
induce tumor-specific T cells
To investigate whether tumor cells expressing immunogenic cell death markers induce antitumor immunity, we
evaluated the ability of tumor cell–loaded DCs to activate
tumor cell–specific T-cell responses. Leukemic cells killed by
selected cytostatic agents or by UV irradiation were cocultured with immature DCs with or without subsequent maturation with LPS. These DCs were then used as stimulators of
autologous T cells, and the frequency of IFN-g–producing T
cells was analyzed 1 week later after restimulation with
tumor cell–loaded DCs. DCs pulsed with REH cells killed by

Discussion
There is considerable interest in understanding the biochemical features of immunogenic versus nonimmunogenic
death of tumor cells induced by anticancer therapies.
Identification of potent activating signals expressed by
immunogenic tumor cells would significantly contribute to
understanding the interaction between tumor cells and the

www.aacrjournals.org

immune system and would facilitate the design of more
effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Recent studies identified several markers accompanying immunogenic cell death.
Our recent study reported the induction of immunogenic cell
death in primary myeloma tumor cells by bortezomib, a
specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome subunit. Immunogenicity of tumor cells correlated with the expression of HSP90
on the surface of myeloma cells killed by bortezomib (4, 5). Cell
surface expression of HSP90 was critical for the immunogenicity of killed tumor cells because activation of DCs was cellcontact dependent, and the specific blockade of HSP90 abolished the immunogenicity of myeloma cells. In addition to
the study on primary myeloma tumor cells, upregulation of
maturation-associated markers was reported for murine DCs

immunogenicity of tumor cells (9, 10). Calreticulin translocation enhanced the phagocytosis of tumor cells by DCs, and
blockade of calreticulin abolished anthracycline-induced
immunogenicity of killed tumor cells in mice. Upon exposure
to anthracyclines, calreticulin translocates very quickly to the
outer leaflet of the cell membrane, whereas other tested
chemotherapeutics fail to induce calreticulin translocation
and thus did not induce immunogenic cell death. The identification of HSPs as markers of immunogenic cell death is also
in accordance with murine studies showing that cell surface
HSPs represent a potent immunogenic signal and promote the
development of autoimmunity. Immunostimulatory activity

HSPs after induction of hyperthermia has also been reported
in various animal tumor vaccination models as well as in the
human in vitro model (20, 21). Together, the common theme
from these independent observations is that the expression of
HSPs on the surface of dying cells may be a marker for
immunogenic forms of cell death and deliver an activating
stimulus to DCs.
Recently, Apetoh and colleagues conducted elegant studies
that led to the discovery of another soluble endogenous
danger signal (6, 8, 12). They reported that TLR4 deficiency
compromised the immunogenicity of tumor cells and identified HMGB1 as a specific ligand of TLR4 that is released
from dying tumor cells at the stage of late apoptosis. HMGB1

is a nonhistone chromatin-binding protein that influences
transcription and other cell functions. HMGB1 is actively
secreted from inflammatory cells or released from necrotic
cells (22, 23). The identity of its receptor is still controversial,
but it signals through TLR2 and TLR4 as well as RAGE (24–26).
Depletion of HMGB1 from tumor cells abolished TLR4-dependent DC-mediated presentation of tumor antigens. The relevance of this study is further illustrated by the finding that
breast cancer patients with the TLR4 allele variant that
reduces the affinity of TLR4 for HMGB1 had a higher incidence
of metastasis after conventional treatments than patients with
the wild-type allele (8).
As most of the data on immunogenic tumor cell death were
obtained using mouse models, we investigated whether analogous mechanisms also apply to human cancer cells. We
tested the capacity of clinically used cytostatics to induce
immunogenic cell death in human tumor cell lines and
primary tumor cells derived from prostate cancer, ovarian
cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
We show that only anthracyclines induced a rapid translocation of calreticulin, HSP70, and HSP90 to the cell surface and the
release of HMGB1 12 hours after the treatment in all 3 models, as

documented by cytometric analysis, confocal microscopy, and
ELISA. The interaction of immature DCs with immunogenic
tumor cells led to an increased tumor cell uptake and induced
moderate expression of maturation-associated markers on DCs.
As in the mice studies published by the group of Zitvogel and
Kroemer, the rate of phagocytosis in our study very closely
correlated with the intensity of calreticulin expression and,
although to a lesser degree, with the intensity of HSP expression.
DCs loaded with anthracycline-killed tumor cells efficiently
stimulated tumor-specific IFN-g–producing T cells, even in the
absence of other maturation stimuli such as LPS. DCs pulsed
with killed immunogenic tumor cells also induced significantly
lower numbers of Tregs, identified as CD4þCD25high and
FoxP3þ, compared with nonimmunogenic tumor cells, which
may be relevant for the design of cancer immunotherapy
studies. To test that by using the phenotypic markers of Tregs,
we indeed identify the cells with inhibitory potential, we sorted
the induced CD4þCD25high T cells to test their inhibitory
capacity in an allogeneic MLR (27) and we did not see any
significant difference in the inhibitory activity of Tregs induced
by DCs loaded with tumor cells killed by various cytostatics
(data not shown).

These data indicate that human prostate cancer, ovarian
cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells share the key
features of immunogenic cell death with mice tumor cells, and
we identified anthracyclines as anticancer drugs capable of
inducing immunogenic cell death in sensitive human tumor
cells. In mouse studies, Obeid and colleagues (10) also showed
that g-ray irradiation and UV light exposure induce a moderate expression of calreticulin on tumor cells and that
irradiated tumor cells expressing calreticulin induce protection against subsequent challenge with live tumor cells. In this
study, we show that killing of human tumor cells by UVA light
exposure (7.6 J/cm2) does not lead to a significant upregulation of immunogenic cell death markers. We also tested tumor
cells killed by g-ray irradiation (20 and 75 Gy, data not shown),
and we did not see any significant upregulation of immunogenic cell death–associated markers in accordance with previous studies in human tumor cells (5, 28). The absence of
significant expression of immunogenic cell death–associated
markers correlated with the low capacity of DCs pulsed with
irradiated tumor cells to induce tumor cell–specific T cells in
the absence of LPS.
Breakthrough studies that identified markers of immunogenic tumor cell death after chemotherapy treatment
challenge the long-time perception of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy as opposing and incompatible treatment
modalities. The introduction of chemotherapy regimens
and their thorough testing in well-designed clinical trials
undeniably represents one of the greatest triumphs of
modern medicine. For example, in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias, an invariably fatal disease in the
1960s, the introduction and subsequent improvement of

chemotherapy protocols led to a cure rate of almost 90% in
the last decade. Despite the continuous introduction of new
drugs and further improvements of chemotherapy protocols, it is likely that, at some point, chemotherapy will reach
its limits, and clinical efficacy will plateau. Moreover,
despite the undeniable success in the treatment of some
malignancies, in some tumors, particularly in solid tumors,
chemotherapy is rarely curative. A combination of treatment modalities has been a standard strategy for cancer
treatment, the combination of surgery with chemo- or
radiotherapy being a classical example. Effort should be
made not only to design modern immunotherapeutic strategies but also to incorporate immunotherapy approaches
into current chemotherapy protocols (29, 30). Chemotherapy and immunotherapy should not be henceforth considered antagonist forms of therapy, and it is conceivable that
their rational combination could substantially improve the
prognosis of cancer patients.
