Abstract
In previous studies, we described a‘‘counter-immunosurveillance’’
mechanism initiated by tumor-activated, interleukin-13
(IL-13)–producing natural killer T cells that signal Gr-1+
cells to produce transforming growth factor-B1 (TGF-B1), a
cytokine that suppresses the activity of tumor-inhibiting
cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Here, we show that in two tumor
models (the CT-26 metastatic colon cancer and the 15-12RM
fibrosarcoma regressor models), this counter-surveillance
mechanism requires the expression of a novel IL-13
receptor, IL-13RA2, on Gr-1intermediate cells, because downregulation of IL-13RA2 expression or the activator protein-1
signal generated by the receptor via in vivo administration
of specific small interfering RNA or decoy oligonucleotides
leads to loss of TGF-B1 production. Furthermore, acting on
prior studies showing that IL-13RA2 expression is induced
(in part) by tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-A), we show that
receptor expression and TGF-B1 production is inhibited by
administration of a TNF-A–neutralizing substance, TNF-ARFc (etanercept). Taking advantage of this latter fact, we then
show in the CT-26 model that counter-immunosurveillance
can be inhibited, anti-CT-26–specific CD8+ cytolytic activity
can be restored, and CT-26 metastatic tumor nodules can
be greatly decreased by administration of TNF-AR-Fc.
Corroborative data were obtained using the 15-12RM
fibrosarcoma model. These studies point to the prevention
of metastatic cancer with an available agent with already
known clinically acceptable adverse effects and toxicity.

Introduction
Recent studies of the murine 15-12RM fibrosarcoma regressor
and CT-26 colon carcinoma lung metastasis models have shown
that the function of T cells engaged in the immunosurveillance of
tumors can be undermined by tumor-driven immune countersurveillance mechanisms. In these studies, it was shown that after a
period of initial growth, the fibrosarcoma undergoes regression due
to the development of cytolytic CD8+ T cells; however, the tumor
later recurs and persists due to the appearance of cells producing
TGF-h1 that inhibits the cytolytic T cells. The chain of cellular
events that leads to such reversal of immunosurveillance involves
first the tumor-induced expansion of NKT cells that produce

interleukin-13 (IL-13), followed by IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 by a
cell bearing a Gr-1 marker (most likely a monocytic cell; refs. 1–3).
An important question that arose from the above studies relates
to how IL-13 signaling activates cells to produce TGF-h1. One
possibility comes from studies of TGF-h1 production during
inflammation that showed that IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 is a
two-stage process whose first stage is the induction of an IL-13
receptor previously thought to be a decoy receptor without
signaling function, IL-13Ra2; this event is then followed by a
second stage involving IL-13 signaling through this receptor. The
initial induction of IL-13Ra2 expression requires IL-4 or IL-13
signaling via the IL-13Ra1 receptor to generate activated Stat6 and
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) signaling to generate nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB), whereas the induction of TGF-h1 secretion
requires IL-13 signaling via IL-13Ra2 to generate an activator
protein-1 (AP-1) variant composed of c-jun and Fra-2 (4).
In the present study, we determined whether TGF-h1 production
arising from IL-13 signaling via IL-13Ra2 as described above
applies to counter-immunosurveillance in the syngeneic CT-26
colon cancer and 15-12RM fibrosarcoma regressor experimental
tumor models.

Materials and Methods
TNF-AR-Fc and control IgG1. TNF-aR-Fc (Enbrel, etanercept) was
purchased from Amgen. It consists of a dimeric fusion protein of the human
(75 kDa) TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Control IgG1
consisted of human polyclonal IgG1 obtained from Invitrogen or HuMik-h1
clinical grade human monoclonal IgG1 antibody obtained from Dr. T.A.
Waldmann [National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, MD]. The
amount of etanercept used was selected based on previous experience using
this human agent in a mouse system (4, 5). The amount of 100 Ag of
etanercept administered every other day is slightly higher than the dose
suggested for use in humans.
Mice. Female BALB/c mice (8–10 wk old) were used in studies of tumor
development in both the CT-26 colon cancer and 15-12RM fibrosarcoma
models. All mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and were
maintained in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) animal holding facilities. Animal use adhered to NIH Laboratory
Animal Care Guidelines and was approved by the NIAID and NCI Animal
Care and Use Committee Review Boards.
Cell lines. The CT-26 cell line (a N-nitro-N-methylurethane–induced
BALB/c murine colon carcinoma cell) was purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 complete medium
supplemented with 10% FCS, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, streptomycin,
and penicillin. The 15-12RM fibrosarcoma cell line (BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts
transfected with HIV-1 IIIB gp160, Ras and Myc) originally developed in this
laboratory was maintained in RPMI 1640 complete medium with 200 Ag/mL
of G418 (6).
Assessment of CT-26 tumor cell pulmonary nodules. The CT-26
tumor model was initiated by tail vein injection of 0.5  106 tumor cells
derived from the CT-26 cell line. Thereafter, mice were randomly separated

into several groups depending on the experiment being conducted.
Enumeration of pulmonary nodules was done at the time control mice
had sufficient numbers of pulmonary tumor nodules to allow reliable
quantitation. In effect, this occurred at day 21 after CT-26 cell injection in
studies wherein treatment was initiated at the time of initial tumor cell
injection and at day 28 in studies wherein treatment was delayed to a later
point in time. CT-26 cell pulmonary nodes were enumerated by counting
the number of macroscopically apparent nodules in dissected lungs (7).
Assessment of s.c. 15-12RM fibrosarcoma growth. One million
15-12RM cells were injected s.c. at a site on the right flank of a mouse
under study. The size of tumor nodules was measured periodically by
caliper gauge.
Encapsulation of small interfering RNA and oligonucleotides in HVJ
envelope vector. Encapsulation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or decoy
oligonucleotides for in vivo transfection was done as previously described (8).
IL-13RA2–specific siRNA. IL-13Ra2–specific siRNA and control (scrambled) siRNA for use in gene silencing studies was obtained from
Dharmacon. The specific mRNA targeting sequence was 5¶-GGAATCTAATTTACAAGGA-3¶. The specificity and efficiency of this siRNA has been
previously shown (4, 9). For in vivo transfection and gene silencing, 100 Ag
of siRNA encapsulated in HVJ envelope (HVJ-E) were administered by
intranasal instillation every other day starting on day 0 after CT-26
injection. The amount of siRNA for in vivo studies was selected based on
previous experience in several different animal models (bleomycin induced
lung fibrosis, chronic TNBS-colitis; refs. 4, 9).
Decoy oligodeoxynucleotide. Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN)
targeting AP-1 were prepared from complementary single-stranded ODN
obtained from Qiagen by melting at 95jC 3 to 5 min followed by incubation
for 3 h at ambient temperature. For in vivo transfection, 100 Ag of AP-1
decoy ODN or scrambled oligonucleotides were administered via an
intratracheal route following encapsulation in HVJ-E. The following
sequences were used: AP-1 decoy ODN, 5¶-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3¶ and 3¶-GCGAACTACTGAGTCGGCCTT-5¶; scrambled decoy ODN, 5¶CATGTCGTCACTGCGCTCAT-3¶ and 3¶-GTACAGCAGTGACGCGAGTA-5¶.
CTL assays. CTL assays were done using cells obtained from single-cell
suspensions of splenocytes isolated from CT-26 tumor-bearing mice.
Splenocytes (2  105 cells) were restimulated in vitro with CT-26 cells
(5  104) treated with mitomycin C. After 2 d, cytolytic activity against CT26 cells was determined by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega).
Western blot. The cells were lysed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer and the whole-cell lysates thus obtained were subjected to SDSPAGE. The separated proteins obtained were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane and immunoblotted. IL-13Ra2 was detected by incubation
with a monoclonal rat anti-mouse IL-13Ra2 (R&D Systems) followed
by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rat IgG
(Invitrogen). Membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Chemical) and exposed to X-ray film.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Cells were stored in RNAlater solution
(Ambion) and then subjected to RNA extraction using RNeasy tissue kit
(Qiagen). A total of 1 Ag template RNA was reverse transcribed with
Superscript III reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Invitrogen). Primer
sequences were as follows: IL-13Ra1: 5¶-GCAGCCTGGAGAAAAGTCGTCAAT-3¶ and 5¶-ACAGCCTCGGCAAGAACACCA-3¶, and glyceraldehyde
phosphodehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5¶-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGA-3¶
and 5¶-TGTTAGTGGGGTCTCGCTCCTG-3¶. Annealing temperature and
cycle number were as follows: IL-13Ra1 60jC and 27 cycles; GAPDH 60jC
and 25 cycles.
ELISA. Cytokine protein concentrations in culture supernatants were
measured by ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Isolated splenocytes were cultured at 37jC. For IL-13 and TNF-a measurements, we cultured 1  106 cells per 1 mL medium for 48 h. For TGF-h1
measurements, we cultured 1  105 cells per 100 AL medium for
24 h. To determine cytokine concentrations, cells were stimulated during
the culture period with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody (10Ag/mL) and
soluble anti-CD28 antibody (1 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences-PharMingen) for
measurement of IL-13. Splenocytes were stimulated during the culture

period with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (1:10,000 dilution of Pansorbin;
EMD Biosciences) and IFN-g (1,000 units/mL; R&D Systems) for measurement of TNF-a. Splenocytes were stimulated during the culture period with
recombinant murine IL-13 (20 ng/mL; R&D Systems) for measurement of
TGF-h1. ELISA kits for IL-13 were purchased from R&D Systems, for TNF-a
from BD Biosciences-PharMingen, and for TGF-h1 from Invitrogen.
Statistical analyses. Student’s t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test
computed by GraphPad Prism 4 was used to evaluate the significance of the
differences. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*); a
value of P < 0.01 was considered statistically highly significant (**).

Results
Expression of IL-13 signaling components in the CT-26
tumor model. In previous studies, it was shown that IL-13 induces
TGF-h1 production via a two-stage process involving first the
induction of IL-13Ra2 expression and second IL-13 signaling via
this receptor (4). To establish if this mechanism of IL-13 activity
occurs in relation to tumor immunity, we determined whether it
was operative in the syngeneic CT-26 colon cancer cell model and,
as described below, in the 15-12RM fibrosarcoma regression model.
In initial studies of the CT-26 model, we determined whether
cells of mice injected with the CT-26 tumor cells activate the first
stage of the IL-13 induction process, namely the induction of
IL-13Ra2 expression. To this end, we first showed that splenic CD4+
T cells and CD11b+ cells stimulated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and by
SAC plus IFN-g, respectively (see Materials and Methods),
produced increased amounts of IL-13 and TNF-a when obtained
from mice injected with tumor cells compared with uninjected
mice (data not shown). Thus, the cells of tumor-bearing mice were
capable of actively synthesizing components that up-regulate
expression of IL-13Ra2. Next, to determine whether IL-13Ra2
expression was indeed up-regulated in the target organ of the
tumor, the lung, we did Western blot studies on extracts of
lung tissue. As shown in Fig. 1A, naı̈ve mice not bearing tumor
(day 0 mice) express little or no IL-13Ra2 in the lung, whereas mice
express this receptor beginning as early as day 7 after tumor
injection. In contrast, IL-13Ra1 (measured by RT-PCR) is expressed
constitutively. Similar findings were obtained with Western blot
studies of spleen cells (data not shown). Such differential
expression of IL-13 receptors has been observed previously under
in vivo conditions in which IL-13 is able to induce TGF-h1 (4, 9).
Characterization of cells responding to IL-13 and producing
TGF-B1 in the CT-26 tumor model. Prior studies have disclosed
that the TGF-h1–producing cell in a tumor-bearing mouse is a
myeloid cell bearing surface CD11b and Gr-1intermediate but that
neither the number of these cells nor the ratio of Gr-1high cells
(granulocytes) to Gr-1intermediate (monocytes and immature granulocytes) change as a result of tumor cell administration (2). To
determine whether this is also the case in the CT-26 tumor model,
we subjected spleen cells of mice 7 days after CT-26 tumor
injection to flow cytometric cell sorting to obtain purified
populations of cells bearing these markers. These studies showed
that once again the ratio of Gr-1high to Gr-1intermediate cells in the
spleens of mice was the same in control mice and mice injected
with tumor cells. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1B, we found that the
cells bearing high amounts of CD11b sorted into two distinct Gr-1–
positive populations, one CD11bhigh/Gr-1high and the other
CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate. To determine which of these cell
populations is involved in TGF-h1 production, we measured
TGF-h1 production and IL-13R expression in the purified (sorted)
cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, after in vitro culture in the presence of

and CD11bhigh/Gr-1high cells and cultured

concentrations in the supernatants were
determined by cytokine-specific ELISA.

experiments each containing pooled cells

D, IL-13Ra1 and IL-13Ra2 expression of
CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells isolated
from the spleen on day 7 after CT-26
injection. Isolated splenocytes were
separated by FACS sorting into CD11bhigh/
Gr-1intermediate cells and CD11bhigh/Gr-1high
cells. IL-13Ra1 mRNA expression was
determined by RT-PCR of RNA extracted
from sorted cells and IL-13Ra2 protein
expression was determined by Western
blot analysis of lysates from sorted cells.

IL-13, only the CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells from tumor-bearing
mice produced substantial amounts of TGF-h1. In addition, as
shown in Fig. 1D, whereas both cell populations expressed
constitutive levels of IL-13Ra1 regardless of tumor burden, only
the CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells expressed IL-13Ra2, and such
expression was noted only after tumor cell injection. Although
these studies were conducted with spleen cell populations, it is
reasonable to assume that cells with similar properties are also
present in the lung of the tumor-bearing mouse.
Inhibition of IL-13 induction of TGF-B1 in the CT-26 tumor
model. If indeed IL-13 induces TGF-h1 production via IL-13Ra2
signaling, one might predict that such production should be
inhibited by administration of various agents that block this
pathway at various stages of its development. Recognizing that
TNF-a (and IL-4 or IL-13) stimulation was necessary to induce
surface expression of IL-13Ra2, in one approach to test this
prediction we administered TNF-aR-Fc (etanercept; 100 Ag by i.p.
injection every other day beginning on day 0 of CT-26 tumor cell
administration) to block TNF-a signaling. As shown in the Western
blot of cell extracts of purified CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate splenocytes prepared on day 7 after CT-26 administration depicted in
Fig. 2A, such treatment prevented the expression of the IL-13Ra2 in
these cells, whereas similar cells from mice treated with control
IgG expressed this receptor. In contrast, expression of the IL-13Ra1
was constitutively present and unchanged in the face of TNF-aR-Fc
treatment (data not shown). In concomitant studies, shown in
Fig. 2B, CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells obtained from the spleens of
mice on day 7 after CT-26 administration and cultured with IL-13
produced increased amounts of TGF-h1 if obtained from mice
subjected to control IgG treatment, whereas those that were

www.aacrjournals.org

subjected to TNF-aR-Fc treatment did not produce increased
amounts of this cytokine.
In a second approach along these lines, we administered IL13Ra2–specific siRNA or control siRNA to mice to directly inhibit
IL-13Ra2 synthesis at the molecular level. In these studies, the
siRNA was administered (at 100 Ag siRNA) every other day by an
intranasal route and the siRNA was encapsulated in a viral coat
preparation to enhance cell entry in vivo (HVJ-E; see Materials
and Methods). As also shown in Fig. 2A and B, the result was
similar to that obtained with TNF-aR-Fc, in that again, treatment
prevents IL-13Ra2 expression and decreased the capacity of
CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells to produce TGF-h1.
In a third and final approach to testing the prediction that
blockade of IL-13Ra2 signaling would block TGF-h1 production,
we blocked such signaling by administration of a decoy
oligonucleotide that competitively inhibits the binding of the
receptors downstream signal, AP-1, to its consensus target
sequence. As in the case of the siRNA, the decoy oligonucleotide
(or a scrambled control oligonucleotide) was administered by
an intranasal route (at 100 Ag ODN) following encapsulation in
HVJ-E. As shown again in Fig. 2A and B, although the specific
AP-1 decoy oligonucleotide had no effect on IL-13Ra2 expression
in CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells, it prevented IL-13–induced
TGF-h1 production, whereas a control (scrambled) decoy had no
such effect.
In summary, blockade of IL-13 signaling via IL-13Ra2 in the
CT-26 tumor system using three distinct blocking strategies led to
inhibition of IL-13–induced TGF-h1 production and it thus seems
reasonable to conclude that IL-13 induces TGF-h1 in this system
via this signaling pathway.

Anti–CT-26 cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells following
inhibition of IL-13 induction of TGF-B1. In previous studies, it
was shown that the induction of TGF-h1 by IL-13 (produced by
NKT cells) leads to diminished CD8+ cell-mediated antitumor cell
cytotoxicity and resultant counter-immunosurveillance (2). We
therefore examined the effect of TNF-aR-Fc, IL-13Ra2–specific
siRNA, or AP-1 decoy oligonucleotide administration as indicated
above on CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxic activity directed against
CT-26 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, whereas CD8+ spleen T cells from
untreated mice 7 days after CT-26 administration exhibited little or
no toxicity for CT-26 cells, CD8+ T cells from mice given all three
inhibitors of IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 exhibited substantial
cytotoxic activity against CT-26 tumor cell targets. Parallel studies
of CD4+ spleen T cell showed that the latter population exhibited
no cytotoxicity for CT-26. Finally, to establish the specificity of
CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity for CT-26 tumor cells, we determined
if these cells were cytotoxic for 4T1 cells (BALB/c mouse mammary
tumor cells). We found that CD8+ spleen cells from mice inoculated
with CT-26 cells did not exhibit cytotoxicity for 4T1 cells, indicating
the specificity of the cytotoxicity against CT-26 cells (data not
shown). Thus, the inhibition of IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 led to the
acquisition of an immune function that could mediate immunosurveillance.
Effect of delayed administration of IL-13 signaling inhibitors on TGF-B1 production and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity.

As a further test of the effect of inhibitors of IL-13 induction of TGFh1 on immune counter-surveillance, we determined the effect of
delayed administration of TNF-aR-Fc (every other day, starting on
day 7) and AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides (weekly, starting on day 7)
after tumor cell injection and evaluation of effects on IL-13Ra2
expression, TGF-h1 production, and cytotoxicity of CD8+ cells on
day 11 after tumor injection. As shown in the Western blot analysis
of extracts of CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells isolated from the
spleens of mice on day 11 after CT-26 cell injection depicted in
Fig. 3A, the cells continued to express IL-13Ra2 after delayed
treatment with both inhibitors. However, as shown in Fig. 3B,
although CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells isolated on day 11 produced increased TGF-h1 in response to IL-13 after delayed
treatment of mice with TNF-aR-Fc starting on day 7, they did not
do so after delayed treatment with AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides. In
addition, as shown in Fig. 3C, a similar dichotomy was observed
with respect to the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ cells for CT-26 tumor
cells: Delayed administration on day 7 of TNF-aR-Fc was associated
with low-level cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells isolated on day 11,
whereas administration of AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides was
associated with robust cytotoxicity of CD8+ cells for tumor cells.
Taken together, these studies show that delayed administration of
TNF-aR-Fc had little or no effect on immune counter-surveillance
in the time frame studied, probably because this inhibitor did not
affect the function of cells already expressing IL-13Ra2. In contrast,

the AP-1 decoy interfered with the downstream signaling of the
receptor even in cells already bearing the receptor.
As in previous studies conducted at an earlier time point,
CD11bhigh/Gr-1high cells isolated at day 11 did not express IL-13Ra2
and did not produce TGF-h1 in response to IL-13. Finally, it should
be noted that treatment of mice with TNF-aR-Fc, IL-13Ra2–
specific siRNA, or AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides did not influence
the serum levels of soluble IL-13Ra2 throughout the entire time
course the mice were monitored in this animal model (data not
shown).
Clinical effect of inhibition of IL-13 induction of TGF-B1
by targeting IL-13RA2 signaling. The clinical effect of
inhibition of IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 by targeting IL-13Ra2
in the CT-26 tumor model was subsequently determined by
mouse mortality and enumeration of macroscopic pulmonary
nodules at 21 days after tumor cell injection. Treatment was
done by using 100 Ag TNF-aR-Fc every other day starting on
day 0, 100 Ag IL-13Ra2–specific siRNA every other day starting
on day 0, or 100 Ag AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides once weekly
starting on day 0. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, mice given tumor

and suffered a mortality rate of 50% by day 21. In contrast,
treatment groups administered with TNF-aR-Fc, IL-13Ra2–
specific siRNA, or AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides at the time of
tumor cell injection exhibited greatly reduced numbers (and
smaller size) of macroscopic tumor nodules and significantly
lower mortality on day 21. It should be noted that because the
number of pulmonary nodules in mice receiving control IgG did
not differ from those not receiving the latter (siRNA control and
scrambled oligonucleotide control mice), there was no evidence
that the control IgG had any effect on tumor development.
In a more stringent test of the possible therapeutic benefit of
targeting IL-13Ra2 signaling in the CT-26 tumor model, we
evaluated the effect of administration of inhibitors beginning at
day 14 after initial tumor cell injection when pulmonary nodules
already made their appearance. Treatment was done by using
100 Ag TNF-aR-Fc every other day starting on day 14, 100 Ag
IL-13Ra2–specific siRNA every other day starting on day 14, or
100 Ag AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides once weekly starting on day 14.

control materials beginning on day 14 again exhibited high
numbers of pulmonary tumor nodules and high mortality rates
on day 28. In addition, in this case, administration of TNF-aR-Fc
every other day beginning at day 14 did not reduce the number of
pulmonary nodules at day 28 and had no effect on mortality,
whereas administration of AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides on day 14
and day 21 led to a significant decrease in the number of
pulmonary nodules at day 28 and greatly reduced mortality. In fact,
mice given AP-1 decoy oligonucleotides exhibited a similar number
of pulmonary nodules at day 28 as control, untreated mice did at
day 14, indicating that this treatment had almost completely
suppressed the progression of tumor formation and also greatly
improved survival of the mice even with delayed treatment.
These findings are compatible with the supposition that by day
14 after tumor cell injection, IL-13Ra2 expression had already been
induced and was therefore beyond the point when it could be
inhibited by TNF-aR-Fc; at this time point, AP-1 decoy ODN could
still exert its negative effect on IL-13Ra2 downstream signaling,
hence the continued clinical effectiveness of the latter blocker.
Effects of targeting IL-13RA2 signaling on the growth of
15-12RM fibrosarcoma. To determine if the IL-13 induction of
TGF-h1 also requires signaling via IL-13Ra2 in a second tumor

model exhibiting counter-immunosurveillance, we turned to the
15-12RM fibrosarcoma tumor model. As noted above, this was in
fact the first tumor model in which immune counter-surveillance
via IL-13 secretion had been shown. As in the case of the CT-26
tumor cell model, tumor growth in this model was associated with
the expression of IL-13, TNF-a, and TGF-h1, and, as shown in
Fig. 6A, CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate spleen cells but not CD11bhigh/Gr1high spleen cells isolated on day 14 after tumor cell injection
expressed IL-13Ra2. Repeated administration of TNF-aR-Fc initiated at the time of tumor cell injection inhibited such expression. In
addition, as shown in Fig. 6B, administration of TNF-aR-Fc greatly
reduced the production of TGF-h1 by CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate
spleen cells. Finally, and most importantly, as shown in Fig. 6C,
treatment of mice initiated at the time of tumor cell inoculation
with TNF-aR-Fc (every other day with 100 Ag or every day with 60 Ag
TNF-aR-Fc) greatly reduced tumor recurrence in two separate
studies: on day 60 or day 80 at the end of the observation period,
tumor recurrence was reduced by f50% in TNF-aR-Fc–treated
mice compared with control IgG-treated mice. These studies
therefore verified that the IL-13 induction via IL-13Ra2 is a central
pathway in counter-immunosurveillance in a second tumor cell
model.

Discussion
In a series of previous studies, it was shown that immunologic
inhibition of tumor growth (immunosurveillance) could be undermined in several different tumor models by tumor-induced
secretion of TGF-h1 and the inhibitory effect of this cytokine on
tumor antigen-specific cytolytic T cells (2, 10–13). Furthermore, it
was shown that such counter-immunosurveillance was initiated by
NKT cells that secrete IL-13 and thereby induce Gr-1 cells to
produce TGF-h1 (1–3, 13). These studies led to attempts to treat
tumors by disarming counter-immunosurveillance. Although these
included the use of antagonists that block the activity of either of
the above cytokines, they did not include approaches that address
key signaling mechanisms involved such as those mediating IL-13
induction of TGF-h1 because the latter were as yet poorly
understood.
With regard to this latter point, previous studies showing that
IL-13 signals via the type II IL-4R, a heterodimer of the IL-4Ra and
IL-13Ra1 that responds to either IL-13 or IL-4, left unanswered the
question of why stimulation of Gr-1 cells to produce TGF-h1
required IL-13 and was independent of IL-4 (14–16). The answer to
this conundrum came from recent studies that showed that
induction of TGF-h1 by IL-13 involves signaling via a second IL-13
receptor, IL-13Ra2, that does not recognize IL-4 (4) and was
previously thought to be a nonsignaling receptor that is secreted
and acts as a decoy for IL-13 (17–21). The fact that the IL-13Ra2
was in fact a signaling receptor and one that signaled cells to
produce TGF-h1 was proven on several grounds (4). First, it was

www.aacrjournals.org

shown that cells lacking cell surface IL-13Ra2 or expressing a
mutant form of this receptor lacking the cytoplasmic tail could not
be induced by IL-13 to produce TGF-h1. Second, it was shown that
agents that blocked the induction of receptor expression also
blocked IL-13 induction of TGF-h1. Third, and finally, it was shown
that signaling via this receptor resulted in AP-1 generation, and
blockade of AP-1 with an AP-1–specific decoy oligonucleotide also
blocked IL-13 induction of TGF-h1. In summary, the evidence that
IL-13Ra2 serves as a signaling receptor for IL-13 during TGF-h1
induction is quite strong and there appears to be little question
that while this receptor can indeed function as a decoy under some
circumstances, it also functions as a bona fide receptor for IL-13.
This conclusion is consistent with a recent study showing that the
soluble and membrane-bound forms of IL-13Ra2 are actually
different splice variants of the IL-I3Ra2 gene, with the soluble form
lacking the transmembrane domain of the molecule and therefore
lacks signaling capability (22).
Further studies of the IL-13Ra2 receptor have shown that this
receptor is not constitutively expressed on the cell surface (as is the
IL-13Ra1) and for this reason the induction of TGF-h1 by IL-13, is,
in reality, a two-stage process characterized by an initial receptor
induction step that is only then followed by the receptor signaling
step described above (4, 9). In addition, such induction requires a
dual signal consisting of IL-4 or IL-13 acting through IL-13Ra1 and
TNF-a acting through its receptor to generate activated Stat6 and
NF-nB, respectively, the factors that transactivate the IL-13Ra2
promoter. With the elucidation of this induction step, the major

factors involved in IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 were now known
and, indeed, it could now be shown that such induction was
inhibited in several models of inflammation by administration of
an agent that blocked IL-13Ra2 receptor induction, TNF-aR-Fc, an
agent that down-regulated the IL-13Ra2 itself, IL-13Ra2–specific
siRNA, and, finally, an agent that blocks the activity of IL-13Ra2
signaling, AP-1 decoy oligonucleotide.
In the present study, all of the major features of the model of
IL-13 induction of TGF-h1 discussed above were noted in the
context of tumor immunosurveillance. In particular, it was
observed that inoculation of mice with CT26 tumor cells was
promptly followed by increased IL-13 and TNF-a secretion as well
as the appearance of the IL-13Ra2 on CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate

cells and the secretion of TGF-h1 by such cells. Furthermore, in
inhibition studies, it was shown that as in the various inflammatory
models mentioned above, TNF-aR-Fc, IL-13Ra2–specific siRNA,
and AP-1 decoy oligonucleotide had predicted effects on IL-13Ra2
expression on CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells and blocked TGF-h1
induction by IL-13; as a result, administration of these inhibitors
restored the ability of CD8+ T cell to kill tumor cells.
In actual studies of control of CT-26 growth via immunosurveillance, we, in effect, again verified the IL-13 signaling
mechanism described above in an in vivo context by showing
that the various inhibitors of the IL-13 signaling greatly reduced
tumor burden in the lung and thereby reduced mortality from the
tumor. Of interest, the response pattern seen was fully consistent

was determined by Western blot analysis of lysates from sorted cells. B, TGF-h1 production of CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells isolated from the spleen on day 14

in the presence of IL-13. Cytokine concentrations in the supernatants were determined by cytokine-specific ELISA. Data shown are representative of two independent
experiments each containing pooled cells from at least eight mice per group. C, recurrence of tumor-bearing mice over time in 15-12RM fibrosarcoma model of

with function of an inhibitor of the signal cascade in that delayed
administration of TNF-aR-Fc rendered this agent ineffective in
treatment, presumably because an agent that blocks induction
of IL-13Ra2 expression could not work after the receptor was
already being expressed (at least in a short-term experiment). In
contrast, AP-1 decoy oligonucleotide continued to exert a
therapeutic effect in the face of delayed therapy, presumably
because continued synthesis of TGF-h1 is necessary to maintain
inhibition of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. More limited studies of the
15-12RM fibrosarcoma were fully consistent with these results in
that also in this case, administration of TNF-aR-Fc inhibited
expression of IL-13Ra2 on CD11bhigh/Gr-1intermediate cells as well as
negative regulation of immunosurveillance.
A major outcome of this study is the discovery that administration of TNF-aR-Fc, a relatively safe TNF-a inhibitor that is
widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, could have
an antitumor effect by enhancing immunosurveillance (23, 24).
This finding, as well as others, support the idea that TNF-a can
have protumor activity and, thus, the treatment of tumors via
TNF-a blockade is a reasonable approach to the treatment of
tumors (25). It should be noted, however, that there is also a
considerable body of evidence supporting the idea that TNF-a can

have antitumor activity especially when present at pharmacologic
concentrations. This is buttressed by studies of the effect of TNF-a
on tumor cell line growth in vitro and studies of the treatment of
patients with tumors with TNF-a in vivo (26–28). Thus, assuming
that endogenous TNF-a may have an inhibitory effect on tumor
growth in some circumstances, it is possible that treating cancer
patients with TNF-a blockers may enhance tumor development.
Nevertheless, it appears that the effect of anti–TNF-a therapy on
any particular tumor is difficult to predict and the final outcome
will depend on such factors as the inherent susceptibility of
the tumor to immunosurveillance, its tendency to undergo
TNF-a–induced apoptosis, and, finally, the ability of TNF-a to
elicit protumor or antitumor effects of immune cells in the milieu
of the tumor. These issues are best sorted out by appropriate
studies of patients with tumors.
