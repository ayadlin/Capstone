Abstract
The bone microenvironment plays a critical role in supporting
the growth and survival of multiple myeloma as well as in
the development of osteolytic bone disease. Signaling through
p38A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mediates
synthesis of multiple myeloma cell growth factors, and its
inhibition reduces proliferation in vitro. However, it is unclear
whether targeting p38A MAPK prevents multiple myeloma
growth and the development of bone disease in vivo. In this
study, we determined whether SCIO-469, a selective p38A
MAPK inhibitor, inhibits multiple myeloma growth and
prevents bone disease in the 5T2MM and 5T33MM models.
SCIO-469 decreased constitutive p38A MAPK phosphorylation
of both 5T2MM and 5T33MM cells in vitro. This was associated
with decreased DNA synthesis and an induction of apoptosis
when the cells were cultured with bone marrow stromal cells.
Treatment of C57Bl/KaLwRij mice bearing 5T33MM cells with
SCIO-469 inhibited p38A MAPK phosphorylation and was
associated with a significant decrease in serum paraprotein,
an almost complete reduction in tumor cells in the bone
marrow, a decrease in angiogenesis, and a significant increase
in disease-free survival. Injection of 5T2MM murine myeloma
cells into C57Bl/KaLwRij mice resulted in myeloma bone
disease characterized by increased osteoclast occupation of
the bone surface, reduced cancellous bone, and the development of osteolytic bone lesions. Treatment of 5T2MM-injected
mice with SCIO-469 reduced this development of bone disease.
Together, these data show that targeting p38A MAPK with
SCIO-469 decreases myeloma burden in vivo, in addition to
preventing the development of myeloma bone disease. [Cancer

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell cancer characterized by the
clonal expansion of malignant cells that accumulate in the bone
marrow, leading to osteoclast and endothelial cell activation,

which, in turn, results in bone destruction and angiogenesis.
Despite the progress achieved in the last few years with high-dose
chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation resulting in a higher
success rate of remission, patients eventually develop drugresistant disease and relapse. New therapies targeting both
multiple myeloma cells and their microenvironment are urgently
required.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38a, a member of
the MAPK family and activated by cytokines and growth factors,
has been reported to be involved in the production of tumorpromoting factors by the multiple myeloma bone marrow
microenvironment. Activation of p38a in bone marrow stromal
cells enhanced the production of interleukin (IL)-6, which is critical
for multiple myeloma growth and survival (1). The p38a MAPK
inhibitor decreased IL-6 secretion in the bone marrow stromal
cells of patients with multiple myeloma, decreasing proliferation
of multiple myeloma cells adherent to bone marrow stromal cells
and IL-6 secretion by the bone marrow stromal cells triggered by
adherence of multiple myeloma cells to bone marrow stromal cells
in vitro (1). The p38a MAPK inhibitor SCIO-469 prevented tumor
necrosis factor-a–induced adhesion of multiple myeloma cells to
bone marrow stromal cells through an intercellular adhesion
molecule 1– and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1–independent
mechanism (2). Furthermore, SCIO-469 enhanced PS-341 (bortezomib)–induced cytotoxicity against multiple myeloma cell lines
and patient’s multiple myeloma cells (3) by inhibiting transient
expression and phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27, a
downstream target of p38. SCIO-469 also enhanced bortezomibinduced multiple myeloma apoptosis by up-regulation of p53 and
down-regulation of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1. In a xenograft model for
plasmacytosis, it was furthermore shown that inhibiting p38
augments the effects of bortezomib in decreasing multiple
myeloma tumor growth in vivo (4). SCIO-469 also inhibits secretion
and expression of the osteoclast-activating factors IL-11, receptor
activator of NF-nB ligand, and macrophage inflammatory protein
1a, and prevents human osteoclast activation in vitro. Recently,
two articles report on the effect of inhibiting p38 on the restoration
of dendritic cell function both in murine and human multiple
myeloma (5, 6). In the present work, we investigated the role of p38
MAPK in the development of multiple myeloma disease in vivo
using the specific p38a MAPK inhibitor SCIO-469 in a fully
immunocompetent murine multiple myeloma model.

Inhibiting p38a MAPK in Myeloma
ously in elderly C57Bl/KaLwRij mice (7, 8). The myeloma cells are
maintained in vivo by i.v. transfer of diseased bone marrow
mononuclear cells into young syngeneic C57Bl/KaLwRij mice (Harlan)
at 6 to 8 weeks of age. When the paraprotein concentration reached
10 mg/mL, the mice were sacrificed and tumor cells isolated according
to previously described procedures (9). For in vitro experiments,
myeloma cells were isolated from the bone marrow of diseased animals
and purified by Lympholyte M (Cedarlane) gradient centrifugation.
All procedures involving mice were approved by the local Research
Ethics Committee (license no. LA1230281) and met the standards
required by the UK Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research 1998
guidelines.
Assessment of the effects of SCIO-469 on the development of
myeloma disease in vivo. For studies of the effect of SCIO-469 on
myeloma development, three groups of male mice (n = 12) were injected

i.v. with 0.5  106 5T33MM cells. Mice were left untreated (naive) or,
if injected with tumor cells, treated from the time of tumor cells injection
with either SCIO-469 (150 or 450 mg/kg powder diet continuously
available for the mice) or a vehicle (PBS) until the first mice showed signs
of morbidity (at 3.7 weeks). Serum paraprotein concentration was assessed
using standard electrophoretic techniques (9), bone marrow tumor burden
was assessed by determining plasmacytosis on cytosmears, and bone
marrow angiogenesis was assessed by determining microvessel density
(see below).
To determine the effect of SCIO-469 on survival, an identical experiment
to that described above was done, with the exception that treatment
continued until each animal showed signs of morbidity (i.e., hind limb
paralysis), at which point they were sacrificed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was
done to determine the effect on time to morbidity. Tumor load was
confirmed on bone marrow samples.

5T33MM cells were incubated in 10% FCI or on irradiated bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC ) after a 1-h preincubation with different concentrations of SCIO-469. DNA
synthesis was measured by a thymidine incorporation assay. C, 5T2MM and 5T33MM cells, cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells through a Transwell system,
were incubated with different concentrations of SCIO-469 and stained for active caspase-3. Points, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05.

Figure 2. In vivo activity of SCIO-469 in
the 5T33MM model. A, 5T33MM mice
were treated twice a day with 90 mg/kg
SCIO-469 p.o. Two hours after last
treatment, mice were sacrificed and bone
marrow was collected for Western blotting.
Equivalent amounts of lysates were blotted
with anti–phospho-p38 and reblotted with
anti-p38 to confirm equal loading. B, naı̈ve
mice or mice bearing 5T33MM cells were
treated with vehicle, SCIO-469 (150 mg/kg),
or SCIO-469 (450 mg/kg). Survival was
assessed by a Kaplan-Meier analysis.

To determine the effect of SCIO-469 on the development of myelomabone disease, studies were done in the 5T2MM model, which develops a
characteristic myeloma bone disease (8, 10, 11). Mice were divided into
the following groups: group 1 (n = 10) remained without tumor cells
(naı̈ve group) and groups 2 to 4 (n = 10 each) were injected via the tail
vein with 2  106 5T2MM cells. At the time of tumor cell injection, mice
were treated with either zoledronic acid (120 Ag/kg, s.c., single dose at
week 7) or SCIO-469 [150 or 450 mg/kg given in the diet throughout the
experimental period (11 weeks)]. At 11 weeks, all mice were sacrificed and
the effects of SCIO-469 and zoledronic acid on tumor burden,
development of myeloma bone disease, and angiogenesis were assessed
(see below).
Radiographic and histologic analyses of bone disease. The tibiae
were X-rayed using a Hewlett Packard Faxitron. X-rays were scanned,
enlarged, and the number of osteolytic lesions counted manually. Tibia
were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, decalcified in EDTA,
embedded in paraffin, and 3-Am sections cut using a Leica Microsystems
Microtome. The sections were either stained with H&E or reacted for
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity to identify osteoclasts and
counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin. The sections were examined by
light microscopy (Leica Microsystems). The number of osteolytic lesions
that penetrated the full thickness of the cortical bone in each tibia was
counted manually. Cancellous bone area was measured in an area 0.56
mm2, 0.25 mm from the growth plate using the osteomeasure analysis
software (Osteometrics). The number of osteoclasts per millimeter and the
percentage surface covered by osteoclasts (osteoclast perimeter) were
measured on 6.5 mm of the cortico-endosteal surfaces, starting 0.25 mm
from the growth plate.
Assessment of microvessel density in vivo. One femur was fixed in
zinc fixative, decalcified, embedded in paraffin, and 3-Am sections cut.
Vessel endothelial cells were stained for the presence of CD31 staining, as
previously described (12). Microvessel density was measured in the area

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

with the highest blood vessel density (hotspot) and the number of blood
vessels was counted per 0.22 mm2.
Assessment of p38A MAPK inhibition by Western blot. 5T33MM
and 5T2MM cells were isolated from the tibiae of diseased mice and
lysed as previously described (13). For assessing the effect of SCIO-469 on
in vitro p38a phosphorylation, 5T2MM and 5T33MM cells were
preincubated with 0.5 Amol/L SCIO-469 for 1 h before being lysed. For
assessing the effect of SCIO-469 on in vivo p38a phosphorylation,
5T33MM mice were treated twice a day with 90 mg/kg SCIO-469 p.o.
Two hours after last treatment, bone marrow was collected for Western
blotting.
The cell debris was then removed by centrifugation (5 min, 13,000 
g ) and sample buffer added. After boiling, the samples were separated
on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing
5% low fat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with anti–phosphoThr180/Tyr182 p38. For measuring total protein levels, the blots were
stripped and reprobed with total p38 antibody (Bioké). The bands
were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham).
Effect of SCIO-469 on thymidine incorporation. 5TMM cells
(1  106/mL) were pretreated with different concentrations of SCIO-469
in either serum-free medium or in 10% Fetal Clone I for (FCI) 1 h. The
cells in serum-free medium were then incubated on irradiated (1,500 rad)
syngeneic bone marrow stromal cells. Sixteen hours before harvest, cells
were pulsed with 1 ACi [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham). Cells were
harvested using a cell harvester (Inotech) onto fiberglass filters (Filtermat
A, Wallac). Filters were dried for 1 h in a 60jC oven and sealed in sample
bags (Wallac) containing 4 mL of Optiscint Scintillation Liquid (Wallac).
Radioactivity was counted using a 1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation
Counter (Wallac). Results are expressed as the relative DNA synthesis
compared with untreated cells.

Results and Discussion
Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that develops
in the bone marrow and, importantly, is highly dependent on the
bone marrow for critical survival signals. Furthermore, there is
now increasing evidence that the bone marrow microenvironment not only supports multiple myeloma cell survival and
proliferation but also regulates drug resistance. Signaling through
p38a MAPK has been shown to play a key role in the survival
and in the proliferation of the multiple myeloma cells and may
also regulate osteoclast formation in vitro. Furthermore, the

p38a inhibitor SCIO-469 also enhances chemotherapy (bortezomib)–induced cytotoxicity of the multiple myeloma cells (3).
However, in view of the bone marrow dependency of the
multiple myeloma cells, it is crucial to assess the effects of such
inhibition in a three-dimensional in vivo bone marrow
microenvironment. We have chosen to do such studies in the
5TMM series of models of myeloma. The 5TMM models, initially
developed by Radl (7), are syngeneic, fully immunocompetent
murine models. Mice are sequentially transplanted with diseased
bone marrow (without in vitro passage) to generate a typical
multiple myeloma disease. All clinical and molecular characteristics studied until now are highly analogous to the human
disease (8) and make these models suitable for preclinical
analysis.
Initially, we examined the effect of SCIO-469 on the biology of
5T2MM and 5T33MM myeloma cells in vitro. Treatment resulted in
a clear inhibition of p38a phosphorylation, as assessed by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 1A). This was associated with a 20% to 40%
inhibition of stromal cell–mediated 5TMM proliferation and an
induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1B and C). No effect was seen on the
level of thymidine incorporation when the 5TMM cells were
cultured in medium containing 10% FCI alone (Fig. 1B). These data
are consistent with the demonstration that SCIO-469 could also
reduce p38 phosphorylation of human myeloma cells and induce
apoptosis in vitro (3).
To assess the effect of blocking the p38a MAPK pathway
in vivo on the development of multiple myeloma disease,
5T33MM injected mice were treated with SCIO-469 from the
time of tumor cell injection. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the
serum samples of these mice resulted in values of 1 and 3 Amol/
L, respectively, which were similar to the values obtained in
patients. Treatment was associated with a reduction in p38a
MAPK phosphorylation, as assessed on bone marrow samples of
treated animals (Fig. 2). This was also associated with a decrease
in serum paraprotein (8.8 F 1.4 g/dL to 0.04 F 0.03 g/dL with
150 mg/kg and to 0.0 F 0.0 g/dL with 450 mg/kg; P < 0.001) and
a reduction in the proportion of tumor cells in the bone marrow
(67.2 F 8.1% to 1.09 F 0.5% for the 150 mg/kg and to 0.0 F 0.0%
for the 450 mg/kg group; P < 0.001; Table 1). Microvessel density
decreased from 25.4 F 1.2 to 19.2 F 0.7 and 19.2 F 0.5,
respectively, for the 150 mg/kg group and the 450 mg/kg group
(P < 0.001), levels similar to that of the naı̈ve controls. This
decrease could be the result of either a direct effect on
angiogenesis or an indirect effect via the reduction in tumor
burden. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increase in disease-free
survival following treatment of the mice with SCIO-469 (vehicle,
27.5 days, versus SCIO-469, 96 days; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2).
To address whether inhibiting the p38a MAPK pathway also
affects the development of myeloma bone disease, studies were

done in the 5T2MM model. Injection of 5T2MM murine myeloma
cells into C57Bl/KaLwRij mice resulted in the growth of myeloma
cells in the bone marrow and the development of bone disease
characterized by increased osteoclast surface (P < 0.05), a
reduction in cancellous bone (P < 0.01), and the presence of
osteolytic bone lesions on X-ray (P < 0.01; Fig. 3). Treatment of
5T2MM-bearing mice with SCIO-469 resulted in a 40% decrease in
serum paraprotein (P < 0.1, for both the 150 mg/kg group and the
450 mg/kg group). Microvessel density was reduced from 25.5 F
0.8 for the control group to 18.8 F 0.7 for the zoledronic acid
group, 20.3 F 0.7 for the SCIO-469 150 mg/kg group, and 18.7 F
0.5 for the 450 mg/kg group (all values, P < 0.001), levels similar
to that of the naı̈ve controls. SCIO-469 treatment (both 150 and
450 mg/kg) also prevented the development of osteolytic lesions
(P < 0.01; Fig. 3). This was also seen with the bisphosphonate
zoledronic acid (P < 0.01), used as a positive control. Histologic
analysis showed that zoledronic acid treatment significantly
reduced the increase in bone surface covered by osteoclasts by
5T2MM cells (P < 0.01). This is consistent with our previous report
showing that repeated dosing is effective in reducing osteoclast
formation and the development of lytic bone lesions in this model
(11). In contrast, SCIO-469 had no effect on osteoclast surface
when compared with mice treated with vehicle. Indeed, osteoclast
perimeter remained significantly increased when compared with
mice treated with zoledronic acid (P < 0.05). The strong inhibition
of lytic lesions yet the absence of an effect on the proportion of
bone surface covered by osteoclasts is consistent with SCIO-469
inhibiting osteoclast activity and function rather than osteoclast
formation.
Our results suggest that, in addition to the previous published
role of SCIO-469 on suppression of soluble factors within the bone
marrow microenvironment in vitro (2), SCIO-469 also reduces
p38a phosphorylation in multiple myeloma cells, both in vitro and
in vivo, resulting in a decreased tumor burden, angiogenesis, and
bone disease, and therefore targets the multiple myeloma disease
at multiple levels. This raises the possibility that targeting p38a
MAPK may offer a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of
multiple myeloma.
