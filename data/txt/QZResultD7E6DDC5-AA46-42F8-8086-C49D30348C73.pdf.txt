Abstract
Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme in mammalian
polyamine biosynthesis that is up-regulated in various types of
cancer. We previously showed that treating human neuroblastoma (NB) cells with the ODC inhibitor A-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) depleted polyamine pools and induced G1 cell
cycle arrest without causing apoptosis. However, the precise
mechanism by which DFMO provokes these changes in NB
cells remained unknown. Therefore, we further examined the
effects of DFMO, alone and in combination with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or Akt/protein
kinase B (PKB) inhibitor IV, on the regulation of cell survival
and cell cycle–associated pathways in LAN-1 NB cells. In the
present study, we found that the inhibition of ODC by DFMO
promotes cell survival by inducing the phosphorylation of
Akt/PKB at residue Ser473 and glycogen synthase kinase-3B at
Ser9. Intriguingly, DFMO also induced the phosphorylation of
p27Kip1 at residues Ser10 (nuclear export) and Thr198 (protein
stabilization) but not Thr187 (proteasomal degradation). The
combined results from this study provide evidence for a direct
cross-talk between ODC-dependent metabolic processes and
well-established cell signaling pathways that are activated
during NB tumorigenesis. The data suggest that inhibition
of ODC by DFMO induces two opposing pathways in NB:
one promoting cell survival by activating Akt/PKB via the
PI3K/Akt pathway and one inducing p27Kip1/retinoblastomacoupled G1 cell cycle arrest via a mechanism that regulates
the phosphorylation and stabilization of p27Kip1. This study
presents new information that may explain the moderate
efficacy of DFMO monotherapy in clinical trials and reveals
potential new targets for DFMO-based combination therapies
for NB treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9825–31]

Introduction
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial childhood
tumor and is derived from the neural crest cells of the sympathetic
nervous system. NB patients diagnosed under the age of 1 year
often experience complete regression of tumors, whereas older
patients often struggle with more advanced stages of the disease,

malignant progression, and poor prognosis partly due to the
emergence of multidrug resistance (1–3). The mechanisms that
control the progression or regression of NB tumors have yet to be
elucidated and thus present a difficult challenge for the treatment
of this disease. Therefore, there is a need for alternative therapeutic
strategies for the treatment of NB.
We and others previously showed that the treatment of MYCNamplified NB cells with a-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an
irreversible suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC),
depleted polyamine pools and caused growth inhibition associated
with p27Kip1/retinoblastoma (Rb)–coupled G1 cell cycle arrest in
the absence of apoptosis (4, 5). DFMO-induced polyamine
depletion, alone or in combination with S-adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) inhibitor SAM486A, effectively increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor
p27Kip1, inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of Rb protein, and
down-regulated MYCN. Other studies have shown that DFMO
treatment of chondrocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6)
induced cell cycle arrest in the absence of apoptosis and activated
the antiapoptotic protein Akt/protein kinase B (PKB; refs. 6, 7).
Akt/PKB is also critical in the regulation of cell cycle progression
by modulating the phosphorylation state and stability of p27Kip1
(8–13).
In the present study, we continued to investigate the role of
p27Kip1 in NB by analyzing the phosphorylation patterns of p27Kip1
in response to polyamine inhibition by DFMO. In addition, we
focused on the protein Akt/PKB and determined the effect of
DFMO on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling
pathway in the presence/absence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV. The paradoxical effect of DFMO by
activation of two separate pathways, one activating Akt/PKB via
PI3K and one inducing cell cycle arrest by regulating p27Kip1, may
explain the moderate efficacy of DFMO-based monotherapies in
clinical trials. We provide further evidence that combination
therapies may prove to be essential for the development of more
effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NB.

from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal p27Kip1, rabbit
polyclonal phospho-p27Kip1 (Ser10), rabbit polyclonal phospho-p27Kip1
(Thr187), and rabbit polyclonal agarose-conjugated p27Kip1 were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr198) was
purchased from R&D Systems. Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit
antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were from Amersham
Biosciences. Protein assay dye reagent was from Bio-Rad Laboratories.
Cell lines and treatment of cultured cells. The human NB cell line
LAN-1 (17) was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Biosource) containing 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 IU/mL), and
streptomycin (100 Ag/mL). If cells were treated with polyamines, 1 mmol/L
aminoguanidine was included as an inhibitor of serum polyamine oxidation.
Cells were seeded 3 to 4 h before treatment with 5 mmol/L DFMO and
analyzed after 4 d. For polyamine studies, 10 Amol/L of putrescine,
spermidine, or spermine were added together with DFMO. For PI3K
and Akt/PKB inhibitor studies, 20 Amol/L of LY294002 or 500 nmol/L of
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV were added after 3 d of DFMO treatment.
SRB assay. The SRB colorimetric assay was used to determine cell
proliferation following the protocol outlined in ref. 18. Briefly, cells were
seeded at a density of 750 per well on a transparent, flat-bottom, 96-well
plate and allowed to settle overnight. At the initiation of each experiment
(t = 0), and after drug treatments, 100 AL of 10% (w/v) TCA were added to
each well, incubated for 1 h at 4jC, washed with deionized water, and dried
at room temperature. One hundred microliters of 0.057% (w/v) SRB solution
were added to each well, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed
four times with 1% (v/v) acetic acid, and allowed to dry at room
temperature. Finally, 200 AL of 10 mmol/L Tris base solution (pH 10.5) were
added to each well, and after shaking for 5 min at room temperature,
the absorbance was measured at 510 nm in a microplate reader. The
absorbance at t = 0 was compared with the absorbance at the end of
the experiment to determine cell growth in treated cells compared with
control cells.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt assay. The CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay is a colorimetric method for determining
the number of viable cells in proliferation or cytotoxicity assays (Promega).
The CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent contains a tetrazolium
compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS)] and was used to determine
the viability of cells treated with DFMO alone and in combination with PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV and compared with untreated
control cells. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 750 per well on a
transparent, flat-bottom, 96-well plate in a total volume of 100 AL. After cell
treatments, 20 AL of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent were added
to wells and incubated for 1 to 4 h at 37jC. The absorbance was measured
at 492 nm using a microplate reader.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (w/v)
sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 135 mmol/L NaCl,
1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmol/L EDTA, supplemented
with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals),
and phosphatase inhibitors, 20 mmol/L sodium fluoride (NaF), and
0.27 mmol/L sodium vanadate (Na3VO4)]. Western blot analysis was
performed as previously described (5). The total protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford dye reagent protein assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Cell lysates in SDS sample buffer were boiled for 5 min
and equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and
electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane
(Millipore). Blots were incubated with phospho-Akt/PKB (Ser473; 1:1,000),
phospho-GSK-3h (Ser9; 1:1,000), phospho-FKHR (Ser256; 1:1,000), phosphoPTEN (Ser380; 1:1,000), phospho-PDK1 (Ser241; 1:1,000), h-actin (1:5,000),
p27Kip1 (1:250), phospho-p27Kip1 (Ser10; 1:250), phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr187;
1:200), or phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr198; 1:200) with gentle agitation, washed with
deionized water, and then incubated with secondary anti-mouse (1:5,000) or
anti-rabbit (1:5,000) antibodies coupled to HRP. After washing the blot with
deionized water, proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak BioMax

XAR film (Fisher Scientific). Membranes were stripped at 50jC for 30 min
with ECL stripping buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS,
100 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol] and sequentially probed. Bands were
quantified using a Bio-Rad Multi Imager and Quantity One Quantitation
Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer plus
inhibitors, and total protein concentration was determined as above. Equal
amounts of total protein (1,000 and 250 Ag in experiments of Fig. 5A and B,
respectively) for each treatment sample were mixed with 1 Ag p27Kip1
agarose-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated in
the cold room overnight with gentle agitation. Agarose-protein immune
complexes were washed with RIPA buffer, and proteins were eluted by
adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. The samples were then
briefly centrifuged to separate agarose beads from immunoprecipitated
proteins. Samples were analyzed by Western blot and quantification was
performed as indicated above.

Akt/PKB (Ser473) and GSK-3h (Ser9) phosphorylation were alleviated by the
addition of putrescine, spermidine, or spermine. These data are representative of
three individual experiments (n = 3).

LAN-1 NB cells were treated with 5 mmol/L DFMO for 3 d and then exposed to LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV for the last 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western
blot for phosphorylation of Akt/PKB (Ser473) and GSK-3h (Ser9). Phospho-Akt/PKB and phospho-GSK-3h bands were quantified and normalized relative to the
DFMO band. DFMO induced the phosphorylation of both proteins. LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV attenuated the effects of DFMO on Akt/PKB. These data
are representative of three individual experiments (n = 3). Columns, mean; bars, SD.

Results
Polyamine depletion–induced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB
and GSK-3B. To investigate the effects of polyamine depletion on
the cell signaling response in NB cells, we treated LAN-1 cells with
DFMO and/or SAM486A and determined the response of protein
Akt/PKB as well as Akt/PKB-associated proteins that either
regulate Akt/PKB activity (PTEN and PDK1) or are themselves
regulated by Akt/PKB (GSK-3h and FKHR; refs. 19–21). DFMO
treatment, either alone or in combination with SAM486A, induced

a rapid increase in Akt/PKB phosphorylation at Ser473, whereas
the total protein levels of Akt/PKB remained unchanged (Fig. 1A).
Identical treatment conditions did not induce the phosphorylation
of Akt/PKB at Thr308. Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of
PDK1, FKHR, or PTEN remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). Interestingly,
identical cell treatments also increased GSK-3h phosphorylation at
Ser9 (Fig. 1A). SAM486A alone had no detectable effect on Akt/PKB
protein expression or Akt/PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 and
Thr308. To verify that the observed effects are specific and due to

on cell proliferation was examined in LAN-1 cells using the SRB assay. B, dose-dependent effects of LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV on cell proliferation were

exposed to increasing concentrations of LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV to the proliferation of respective untreated or DFMO-treated cells in the absence of LY294002
or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV. LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV inhibited proliferation further in a dose-dependent manner. C, effect of 5 mmol/L DFMO on cell viability
was examined in LAN-1 cells using the MTS assay. D, dose-dependent effects of LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV on cell viability were examined in LAN-1 cells in the

LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV to the viability of untreated or DFMO-treated cells in the absence of LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV. Akt/PKB inhibitor IV decreased
cell viability to the same degree in control and DFMO-treated cells. LY294002 affected cell viability to a lesser degree. DFMO potentiated the effect of LY294002
on cell viability. Columns, mean of three independent experiments (n = 3); bars, SE.

DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion, polyamines were added
exogenously to DFMO-treated cells. We found that the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at Ser473 and GSK-3h at Ser9 was comparably
attenuated by the addition of putrescine, spermidine, or spermine
(Fig. 1B).
To further investigate the DFMO-dependent regulation of Akt/
PKB, we next examined the effect of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV on the phosphorylation state of Akt/PKB
and GSK-3h. Whereas LY294002 inhibits PI3K and affects the
signaling to numerous downstream proteins including Akt/PKB,
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV inhibits a kinase directly upstream of Akt/
PKB. We found that cell treatments with either LY294002 or
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV reduced DFMO-induced phosphorylation of
Akt/PKB and, to a lesser degree, of GSK-3h (Fig. 2). These results
show that DFMO induces the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at
Ser473 via the PI3K pathway, which in turn phosphorylates and
thus inactivates GSK-3h.
The effects of DFMO and Akt/PKB inhibitors on proliferation and viability of NB cells. To determine the role of Akt/PKB
in DFMO-induced cell cycle arrest in LAN-1 NB cells, the dosedependent effects of inhibitors LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV,
alone or in combination with DFMO, were studied using the SRB
assay. The results clearly show that DFMO treatment alone
inhibited proliferation in LAN-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Addition of
LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV further decreased the proliferation in both DFMO-treated and control cells in a dose-dependent
fashion (Fig. 3B). Overall, the inhibitory effects of LY294002 were
less pronounced than those of Akt/PKB inhibitor IV.
To confirm these findings, we examined the effects of DFMO,
LY294002, and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV using the MTS cell viability
assay. The results supported the findings observed with the SRB
assays. DFMO treatment alone decreased cell viability (Fig. 3C).
LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV further decreased the viability
of cells in both DFMO-treated and control cells (Fig. 3D). However,
whereas the decrease in cell viability was similar between Akt/PKB
inhibitor IV and LY294002 in DFMO-treated cells, the effects of
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV alone were much more striking than those of
LY294002 in control cells.
To further investigate the cytotoxic effects of LY294002 and
Akt/PKB inhibitor IV, both inhibitors were examined in DFMOtreated and control cells by Western blot analysis and probing for
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (a late apoptotic
event). The results showed that LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV

induced PARP cleavage in DFMO-treated and control cells (Fig. 4).
PARP cleavage was not detected with DFMO treatment alone. The
combination of DFMO with LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV also
led to a decrease in the total protein level of noncleaved (116 kDa)
PARP protein.
The effects of DFMO on p27Kip1 phosphorylation. Although
we previously showed that the treatment of LAN-1 cells with
DFMO induced p27Kip1 accumulation and p27Kip1/Rb-coupled G1
cell cycle arrest (5), the mechanism by which DFMO induces these
effects has not been established. Therefore, we examined the
phosphorylation state of p27Kip1 in response to DFMO treatment.
Total p27Kip1 protein was immunoprecipitated from DFMO-treated
and control cells and immunoblotted to assess the phosphorylation
state of p27Kip1 using phospho-specific antibodies targeted against
individual p27Kip1 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 5A). Although there
was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser10
and Thr198 with DFMO, the phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at the
Thr187 site was not affected.
Because p27Kip1 is a downstream target of Akt/PKB, we next
tested whether DFMO-induced activation of Akt/PKB directly
modulates the phosphorylation state of p27Kip1. To accomplish
this, we examined the effects of inhibitors LY294002 and Akt/PKB
inhibitor IV on the phosphorylation state of p27Kip1 in DFMOtreated and control cells. We immunoprecipitated total p27Kip1
protein and immunoblotted for phospho-p27Kip1 (Ser10, Thr187, and
Thr198) using phospho-specific p27Kip1 antibodies. We found that
LY294002 did not attenuate DFMO-induced phosphorylation of
p27Kip1, which would be expected if Akt/PKB was the major
phosphorylating enzyme (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, LY294002 alone
and in combination with DFMO increased p27Kip1 protein
expression and phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser10 and Thr198
(Fig. 5B). This effect was significantly augmented in LY294002treated cells compared with DFMO-treated and control cells
without LY294002. Akt/PKB inhibitor IV had little or no effect
on p27Kip1 protein and phosphorylation of p27 at Ser10 and Thr198
(Fig. 5B). Both LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV did not have any
detectable effects on phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr187.

Discussion
Previous studies showed that DFMO treatment of LAN-1 NB cells
depleted putrescine levels and decreased spermidine and spermine
levels by 84% and 47%, respectively (5). DFMO also induced G1 cell
cycle arrest but did not cause apoptosis. In the present study, we

for 24 h and analyzed for PARP cleavage by Western blot analysis. Total PARP bands (116- and 89-kDa bands) were quantified and normalized to the untreated
control. The cleaved PARP bands were quantified, normalized to untreated control, and expressed as the percentage (%) of cleaved PARP. Both inhibitors induced
PARP cleavage in both untreated and DFMO-treated cells. Combined treatment of DFMO and LY294002 or Akt/PKB inhibitor IV decreased the total amount of
noncleaved PARP protein. These data are representative of three individual experiments (n = 3). Columns, mean; bars, SD.

Figure 5. Effect of DFMO on phosphorylation state of p27Kip1 in LAN-1 NB cells. A, p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated (IP ) and analyzed for phosphorylation at
Ser10, Thr187, and Thr198, as well as total p27Kip1 protein levels. DFMO induced p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Ser10 and Thr198. B, the effects of inhibitors LY294002
and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV on p27Kip1 phosphorylation state were examined by immunoprecipitating p27Kip1 protein and analyzing the immunoprecipitated protein for
phosphorylation at Ser10, Thr187, and Thr198. LY294002 increased phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser10 and Thr198 and total p27Kip1 protein in both control and
DFMO-treated cells compared with cells not exposed to the inhibitor. Akt/PKB inhibitor IV had a similar effect but to a lesser degree than LY294002. Protein bands
were scanned and the ratio of phospho-p27Kip1 to total p27Kip1 was quantified and normalized to the ratio obtained from DFMO (A ) or DFMO + LY294002 (B )

investigated the role of Akt/PKB in DFMO-treated LAN-1 NB cells.
We found that the survival of DFMO-treated cells is mediated, at
least in part, by the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB via the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway. DFMO also induced GSK-3h phosphorylation at
residue Ser9. This phosphorylation event leads to the inactivation
of GSK-3h, which is also associated with inhibition of apoptosis.
The differences in GSK-3h phosphorylation with DFMO compared
with SAM486A treatment may reflect the changes in intracellular
polyamine content resulting from inhibition of different polyamine
biosynthesis enzymes, ODC and AdoMetDC, respectively. With
DFMO, putrescine and spermidine levels are depleted, whereas
spermine levels remain relatively stable. SAM486A induces strong
accumulation of putrescine and depletion of spermidine and
spermine (5). The different effects of these inhibitors on polyamine
contents could account for the different effects of DFMO and
SAM486A on GSK-3h phosphorylation.
The DFMO-induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation was mediated by
polyamines, as addition of individual polyamines alleviated this
effect. However, it is not clear whether the attenuation of the
DFMO effects was due to one particular polyamine because all
three polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) exerted
the same response. The effect of DFMO on Akt/PKB was found to

occur via PI3K and not PDK2. This is an interesting finding, as
previous studies showed that Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt/PKB
was primarily mediated by PDK2 (22). Although Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt/PKB was not detected in DFMO-treated or control
cells, we were able to detect Akt/PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 in
Akt/PKB-activated positive control extracts, thus verifying that
the Akt/PKB Thr308 phospho-antibody is able to detect phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at this site (data not shown). Therefore, the
activation of Akt/PKB and the Akt/PKB-mediated effects observed
in this study (such as GSK-3h phosphorylation) did not require
Thr308 Akt/PKB phosphorylation.
Next, we investigated the role of Akt/PKB in cell survival during
DFMO-induced polyamine depletion by examining the effects of
LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV on cell proliferation, cell
viability, and PARP cleavage, a marker for late apoptosis. LY294002
and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV decreased proliferation and cell viability
and induced apoptosis in both untreated and DFMO-treated cells.
The effects of LY294002 and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV seemed to be
stronger when combined with DFMO. However, Akt/PKB inhibitor
IV was more effective than LY294002 in control cells. Interestingly,
the total levels of noncleaved (116 kDa) PARP protein decreased
in DFMO/LY294002–treated and DFMO/Akt/PKB inhibitor

but not Thr187 (white ) as well as protein accumulation, thereby contributing to G1
cell cycle arrest. Concomitantly, DFMO treatment leads to activation of Akt/PKB
by phosphorylation at Ser473 (black ) but not Thr308 (white ) as well as inactivation
of GSK-3h by phosphorylation at Ser9 (black ).

IV–treated cells, suggesting that this combination treatment also
affects the synthesis or degradation pathways of PARP. The
different effects of LY294002 compared with Akt/PKB inhibitor IV
on these processes may reflect the different molecular targets of
these two inhibitors. LY294002 is a known inhibitor of PI3K but it
has also been shown to directly inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; ref. 23). Furthermore, LY294002 has the potential to
alter many more effectors and proteins that are downstream from
PI3K compared with Akt/PKB inhibitor IV. Akt/PKB inhibitor IV
inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of a kinase directly
upstream of Akt/PKB but downstream of PI3K. One potential
candidate protein that may be differently modulated by LY294002
and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV is mTOR, a protein that is known to
function as a sensor of cellular energy and as a regulator of cell
survival and cell proliferation (24–29). Therefore, it may influence
the LY294002 effects on cell proliferation, viability, and survival
observed in this study. The results from this study clearly show that
cell survival during DFMO treatment is mediated by the PI3K/Akt
pathway. In addition, our results reveal a unique mechanism by
which DFMO-induced phosphorylation of Ser473, in the absence
of Thr308 phosphorylation, promotes survival in NB cells through
a process that is mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

To further explore DFMO-induced effects in NB cells, we looked
at the phosphorylation state of p27Kip1. We found that DFMO
increased p27Kip1 phosphorylation (Ser10 and Thr198) and led to
p27Kip1 accumulation. Next, we investigated the role of Akt/PKB in
this process, as Akt/PKB has been shown to directly phosphorylate
p27Kip1 (10–13). We found that LY294002 increased the DFMOinduced phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser10 and Thr198 and
accumulation of p27Kip1, and Akt/PKB inhibitor IV had little or
no effect on p27Kip1. Therefore, Akt/PKB is either not involved or
plays a minimal or indirect role in this process.
Skp2 is part of the SCFskp2 ubiquitin ligase complex that
regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of p27Kip1 (30–35).
DFMO-induced p27Kip1 phosphorylation and accumulation may
reflect a disruption of the SCFskp2-mediated degradation of
p27Kip1. We observed that Thr198 phosphorylation of p27Kip1
increased with DFMO, potentially stabilizing the protein and
decreasing the degradation of p27Kip1, suggesting that disruption
of p27Kip1 degradation may be involved in the accumulation of
p27Kip1. This is supported by our previous work in which DFMO
treatment led to hypophosphorylation of Rb protein (5). Rb is
involved in the regulation of SCFskp2 ubiquitin ligase-mediated
p27Kip1 degradation via the Skp2 autoinduction loop (36, 37).
DFMO-induced hypophosphorylation of Rb and accumulation of
p27Kip1 may disrupt the Skp2 autoinduction loop, consequently
promoting p27Kip1/Rb-coupled G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore,
the LY294002-induced stabilization and accumulation of p27Kip1
may be regulated by mTOR/SCFskp2 signaling and/or GSK-3h–
mediated regulation of CDK2 assembly with p27Kip1 and Skp2
protein expression (38, 39).
Based on our new findings and those from previous studies,
DFMO induces two opposing pathways: one leading to p27Kip1mediated G1 cell cycle arrest and one leading to Akt/PKB-mediated
cell survival. The two pathways and the potential role of Akt/PKB,
mTOR, and GSK-3h in regulating the effects of DFMO are
illustrated in Fig. 6. These effects occur as a consequence of
polyamine depletion induced by DFMO inhibition of ODC, which
is a sentinel metabolic enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, further
supporting the potential value of targeting metabolic enzymes as a
treatment for cancer. Whereas cell cycle arrest induced by DFMO is
a positive aspect of this drug, DFMO-induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation is not ideal for the treatment of cancer. However, our study
provides important information as to why several clinical cancer
trials with DFMO-based monotherapies may have failed in the past
(40–42). DFMO exerts cytostatic effects, slowing the progression of
some cancers possibly by inducing prolonged growth inhibition,
but does not exhibit cytotoxic effects in most cancers. The lack
of cytotoxicity in cancer cells may be due to DFMO-induced
activation of Akt/PKB, conferring resistance to apoptosis. The
results from the present study support the argument for
combination therapies, which may overcome the obstacle of
chemoresistance. Further investigation into targeting metabolic
enzymes and combination therapies that affect PI3K/Akt signaling
and cell cycle regulation in cancer may prove essential for the
development of more effective treatment strategies.
