ABSTRACT
In tumor-bearing state, the function of neutrophils is converted from tumorsuppressing to tumor-promoting. Here we report that priming with IFN-γ and TNF-α
could convert the potential of neutrophils from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing.
The neutrophils with protumor potential have not lost their responsiveness to IFN-γ
and TNF-α. After priming with IFN-γ and TNF-α, the potential of the neutrophils
to express Bv8 and Mmp9 genes was reduced. Conversely, the tumor-promotional
neutrophils recovered the expression of Rab27a and Trail, resumed the activation
levels of PI3K and p38 MAPK pathways in response to stimuli, and expressed higher
levels of IL-18 and NK-activating ligands such as RAE-1, MULT-1, and H60. Therefore,
the anti-tumor function of the neutrophils was augmented, including the cytotoxicity
to tumor cells, the capability of degranulation, and the capacity to activate NK cells.
Since the function of NK cells is impaired in tumor-bearing state, the administration
of normal NK cells could significantly augment the efficiency of tumor therapy based
on neutrophil priming. These findings highlight the reversibility of neutrophil function
in tumor-bearing state, and suggest that neutrophil priming by IFN-γ/TNF-α might
be a potential approach to eliminate residual tumor cells in comprehensive strategy
for tumor therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Therefore, a new approach for tumor therapy by targeting
neutrophils might be, instead of depleting neutrophils, the
conversion of neutrophil function from tumor-promoting
to tumor-suppressing.
Neutrophils could promote tumor progression by
producing proangiogenic factors such as Bv8 [4, 5], and
MMP-9 [2, 3]. On the other hand, however, neutrophils
could release TRAIL, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and
neutrophil elastase (NE), which not only suppress
angiogenesis and induce vascular disruption, but also
induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of tumor
cells [6, 14]. Therefore, increasing the expression of Bv8
and MMP-9 and reducing the expression or release of
TRAIL, MPO and NE might be crucial for the protumor
function of neutrophils. Conversely modulating the
expression and/or release of these factors might be crucial

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or
neutrophils) make up a significant portion of the
inflammatory cell infiltrate found in various human
cancers and murine models [1]. In recent years there is
substantial evidence to show significant pro-tumor actions
of neutrophils [2-7]. The increased peripheral blood
neutrophil counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio
have been associated with poor clinical outcomes and
short overall survival [8-10]. These findings suggested that
neutrophils might be a potential target for tumor therapy.
However, although the depletion of neutrophils showed
antitumor effect [11-13], it is still difficult to consider
neutrophil depletion as an approach for tumor therapy due
to the important physiological function of neutrophils.

for the conversion of neutrophil function from tumorpromoting to tumor-suppressing. It is known that the
priming of neutrophils by inflammatory cytokines such
as IFN-γ and TNF-α could enhance the capability of
neutrophils to degranulate in response to suitable stimuli,
which is the main way for neutrophils to release TRAIL,
MPO and NE [15-17]. However, so far it is unknown
whether the neutrophils with protumor potential could be
remodeled by priming with these cytokines.
In tumor-bearing state, G-CSF and IL-6 cooperated
to enhance the potential of neutrophils to express Bv8 and
MMP-9, and decrease the ability of neutrophils to release
TRAIL, MPO and NE [7]. Consistently, the increased
levels of serum G-CSF and IL-6 have been associated
with poor prognosis in different types of cancer [18-22].
Therefore, in this study we investigated whether IFN-γ
and TNF-α could modulate the expression and/or release
of the above-mentioned factors by neutrophils with
protumor potential (or G-CSF/IL-6-primed neutrophils),
thus reversing the function of the neutrophils. Our data
showed that protumor neutrophils can be remodeled by
IFN-γ and TNF-α, even in the presence of G-CSF/IL-6,
resulting in the conversion of neutrophil function from
tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing. Our data suggest
that neutrophils might be indeed a promising target for
tumor therapy.

When the neutrophils were isolated from tumorbearing mice and pG/pI6-mice, the expression of Ccl17
gene was induced by T-sMs in the neutrophils from C-PC,
but not the neutrophils from I-PC (Figure 1B), suggesting
that the phenotype of the neutrophils might be switched to
antitumorigenic in inflammatory environment, since Ccl17
is expressed in the neutrophils with a protumorigenic
phenotype but not those with antitumorigenic phenotype
[12, 23, 24]. To further confirm this, we tested the function
of the neutrophils from C-PC and I-PC in co-inoculation
test. The neutrophils from C-PC of tumor-bearing mice
and pG/pI6-mice promoted tumor growth, whereas the
neutrophils from I-PC showed a strong inhibitory effect
on tumor growth (Figure 1C). Taken together, these results
suggest that the potential of neutrophils could be converted
from protumor to antitumor in inflammatory environment.

IFN-γ and TNF-α could induce the conversion of
neutrophil function
To explore the mechanisms underlying the
conversion of neutrophil function in inflammatory
environment, we focused on the inflammatory cytokine
IFN-γ and TNF-α which were produced in I-PC, but
not in C-PC (Supplemental Figure S1). The neutrophils
from C-PC of different mice were treated with IFN-γ
and/or TNF-α. After the treatment, the neutrophils from
both tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice showed antitumor function in co-inoculation test (Figure 2A). The
co-stimulation with IFN-γ and TNF-α was more efficient
in promoting anti-tumor function of neutrophils (Figure
2B). We then analyzed whether IFN-γ and TNF-α could
reverse the expression of Bv8 and Mmp9 in neutrophils.
IFN-γ, but not TNF-α, could significantly reduce the
expression of Bv8 and Mmp9 in the neutrophils from
tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice, and abrogate the
promoting effect of T-sMs on the expression of Bv8 and
Mmp9 (Supplemental Figure S2). The same effect was
observed when the neutrophils were treated with IFN-γ
in combination with TNF-α (Figure 2C). These results
suggest that IFN-γ and TNF-α could efficiently induce the
conversion of neutrophil function, although only IFN-γ
has an inhibitory effect on the expression of Bv8 and
Mmp9.

RESULTS
Tumor-promoting neutrophils could be remodeled
in inflammatory environment
In tumor-bearing state, G-CSF/IL-6 could induce
the protumor potential of neutrophils in bone marrow
[7]. To explore whether the function of neutrophils
could be remodeled, we recruited neutrophils to the
non-inflammatory and inflammatory peritoneal cavity
of naive mice, tumor-bearing mice and the mice with
in vivo expression of G-CSF and IL-6 (pG/pI6-mice).
When neutrophils were recruited to peritoneal cavity
with CXCL1-expressing cells (C-PC, non-inflammatory)
[7], the neutrophils from tumor-bearing mice and pG/
pI6-mice showed a protumor phenotype, characterized
by higher expression of Bv8 and Mmp9 as well as lower
expression of Rab27a and Trail [7]. The stimulation of
these neutrophils with soluble molecules from tumor
(T-sMs) further modulated the expression of these genes,
resulting in the same expression pattern of these genes
as that of the neutrophils from tumor tissues (Figure
1A). However, when neutrophils were recruited to
inflammatory peritoneal cavity (I-PC), the expression
pattern of these genes was reversed. The stimulation with
T-sMs resulted in the same gene expression pattern as that
of the neutrophils from naive mice (Figure 1A).

IFN-γ and TNF-α resume the antitumor potential
of neutrophils
We next investigated whether IFN-γ and TNF-α
could resume the antitumor potential of the neutrophils
from tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice. In tumorbearing state, the capability of neutrophils to degranulate
is attenuated due to the inhibitory effect of G-CSF/IL-6
on activation of PI3K and p38 MAPK pathways and the
expression of Rab27a [7]. After priming with IFN-γ and

TNF-α, the activation of PI3K and p38 MAPK pathways
in the neutrophils from tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6mice in response to T-sMs was increased to the levels
similar to those in the neutrophils from naive mice (Figure
3A). Moreover, the treatment with IFN-γ increased the
expression of Rab27a gene in neutrophils from different
mice (Figure 3B). T-sMs down-regulated Rab27a
expression in the un-primed neutrophils. However, if the
neutrophils were pre-treated with IFN-γ or TNF-α, T-sMs
increased Rab27a expression in the neutrophils from
tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice to the similar level
of that in the neutrophils from naive mice (Figure 3B). The
expression of Trail and the production of soluble TRAIL
were similarly modulated (Figure 3B).
The treatment with IFN-γ or TNF-α did not

influence the spontaneous degranulation of neutrophils
(Supplemental Figure S3), but augmented the induced
degranulation by neutrophils in response to T-sMs,
evaluated by the release of MPO (Figure 3C). The
release of NE and soluble TRAIL was also increased
(data not shown). Consistent with the release of these
factors, the cytotoxicity of neutrophils to tumor cells
was augmented by priming with IFN-γ and TNF-α
(Figure 3D; Supplemental Figure S4). Intriguingly, the
neutrophils from C-PC of tumor-bearing mice and pG/
pI6-mice showed the cytotoxicity similar to that of the
neutrophils from naive mice after priming. Taken together,
these results demonstrate that the response of protumor
neutrophils to T-sMs was reversed by priming with IFN-γ
and TNF-α, thus resulting in the conversion of neutrophil

cells, CXCL1 promoted tumor growth. IFN-γ and TNF-α
reversed the effect of CXCL1, but were less efficient in
suppressing tumor growth (Figure 4A). We therefore
investigated whether G-CSF and IL-6 might antagonize
the priming of neutrophils by IFN-γ and TNF-α. The
results showed that G-CSF/IL-6 could not antagonize
the priming effect of IFN-γ/TNF-α, evaluated by the
activation of signaling pathways, MPO release, and tumorsuppressing effect of neutrophils (Supplemental Figure
S6).
We then compared the neutrophils from the tissues
at tumor inoculation site after local expression of CXCL1/
IFN-γ/sTNF-α in naive mice and pG/pI6-mice. The
results showed that IFN-γ/sTNF-α indeed modulated the
expression of Bv8, Mmp9, Rab27a, and Trail in neutrophils
in vivo (Figure 4B), resulting in similar expression pattern
of these genes in the neutrophils of naive mice and pG/
pI6-mice. Moreover, MPO and NE in the local tissues of
pG/pI6-mice reached similar levels to those in naive mice
after treatment (Figure 4C). These results suggested that
the neutrophils were similarly primed by IFN-γ/sTNF-α
in pG/pI6-mice and naive mice.

Neutrophil function could be remodeled in vivo by
local expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α
We next investigated whether the conversion of
neutrophil function could be induced in vivo by local
expression of IFN-γ and/or TNF-α. Lower dosages of
expression vectors were used for local transfection to
express IFN-γ, soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α), and neutrophil
chemokine CXCL1. When naive mice were inoculated
with tumor cells, IFN-γ and sTNF-α cooperated with
CXCL1 to more efficiently suppress tumor growth
(Supplemental Figure S5). Although TNF-α could
suppress tumor growth by directly inducing the apoptosis
of tumor cells via TNFR-1 [25], the neutrophils recruited
to local tissue were important for the anti-tumor effect of
TNF-α. The anti-tumor effect of TNF-α and/or IFN-γ was
augmented by neutrophil chemokine CXCL1, and was
attenuated by depleting neutrophils (Supplemental Figure
S5B and S5C).
When pG/pI6-mice were inoculated with tumor

NK activating capability of neutrophils is
efficiently induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α

IFN-γ/TNF-α, but CXCL1/IFN-γ/TNF-α was less efficient
in suppressing tumor growth in pG/pI6-mice, suggesting
that the release of anti-tumor factors such as TRAIL,
MPO, and NE might only partially contribute to the antitumor effect of the primed neutrophils. Since activating
NK cells is another aspect of neutrophils’ function [26],

The data in Figure 4 showed that the neutrophils
in pG/pI6-mice and naive mice were similarly primed by

Figure 5: NK activating capability of neutrophils is efficiently induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α. (A, B) Neutrophils were

isolated from C-PC of naive mice, tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice. The cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (20 ng/ml) or TNF-α (10 U/

After the treatment with IFN-γ and/or TNF-α for 12 h, and the removal of IFN-γ and TNF-α by washing with PBS, the neutrophils were
co-cultured with the NK cells isolated from naive mice (D) or tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice (E) for 12 h. IFN-γ-expressing NK cells
were detected by flow cytometry as described in Methods. (F) Neutrophils (from I-PC) and NK cells (from spleen) were isolated from naive

we therefore wondered whether G-CSF and IL-6 might
influence the NK-activating capacity of neutrophils.
To clarify this, we first analyzed the expression of NKactivating ligands in neutrophils, including RAE-1, MULT1, and H60 [27]. The results showed that TNF-α could
up-regulate the expression of RAE-1 and H60, and that
IFN-γ promoted the expression of MULT-1 (Figure 5A;
Supplemental Figure S7). Moreover, IFN-γ up-regulated
the expression of IL-18 (Figure 5B; Supplemental Figure
S7) which can promote the activity of NK cells [28].
There was no difference between the neutrophils from
naive mice and pG/pI6-mice, which was also confirmed
by analyzing the neutrophils isolated from the tissues at
tumor inoculation site (Figure 5C). Moreover, the primed
neutrophils from different mice could similarly express
higher level of CCL3, a chemokine for recruiting NK
cells [29], and promote the infiltration of NK cells in local
tissue (supplemental Figure S8).
After priming with IFN-γ and/or TNF-α, the

neutrophils from different sources could similarly induce
the production of IFN-γ by the NK cells from naive mice
(Figure 5D; Supplemental Figure S9), but not the NK
cells from tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice (Figure
5E). The NK cells from tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6mice could not cooperate with the primed neutrophils to
produce stronger cytotoxicity to H22 tumor cells (Figure
5F; Supplemental Figure S10). Consistently, splenocytes
from tumor-bearing mice and pG/pI6-mice showed lower
cytotoxicity to YAC-1 cells (Supplemental Figure S11).
Moreover, depleting NK cells significantly attenuated the
anti-tumor effect of the primed neutrophils in naive mice,
but not in pG/pI6-mice (Figure 5G). Taken together, these
results suggest that priming with IFN-γ and TNF-α could
augment the NK-activating capability of the neutrophils
from different sources, but the impairment of NK cell
function could attenuate the antitumor effect of the
neutrophils.

Normal NK cells are required for better efficacy
of therapeutic approach based on neutrophil
priming

of the neutrophils to T-sMs. In tumor-bearing state, the
protumor potential of neutrophils is induced in bone
marrow, which is mediated by G-CSF/IL-6 [7]. A “N2”
phenotype of these neutrophils could be induced by
further stimulation with T-sMs. However, when G-CSF/
IL-6-primed neutrophils were further primed by IFN-γ/
TNF-α, the stimulation with same T-sMs could induce
a “N1” phenotype of neutrophils. Importantly, our data
demonstrate that the protumor potential of neutrophils
in tumor-bearing state and their reactivity to T-sMs
are reversible. Neutrophils are short-lived leukocytes.
Therefore, altering the responsiveness of newly-recruited
neutrophils to T-sMs might be sufficient for switching
the effect of neutrophils on tumor from promotional to
suppressive.
Priming by cytokines could augment the responses
of neutrophils to subsequent stimulation [17, 30, 31].
Accordingly, priming with either G-CSF/IL-6 or IFN-γ/
TNF-α could augment the responsiveness of neutrophils
to T-sMs, resulting in different phenotypes. In tumorbearing state, G-CSF/IL-6 could endow neutrophils with
protumor potential by inducing the enhanced activation
of STAT3 and attenuating the activation of PI3K and
p38 MAPK pathways in response to T-sMs [7]. The
enhanced activation of STAT3 is crucial for modulating
the expression of Bv8, Mmp9, Rab27a, Trail [7]. IFN-γ
and TNF-α have the potential to antagonize the effect
of STAT3. IFN-γ antagonizes the effect of STAT3 by
activating STAT1 and SOCS3 [32, 33]. TNF-α promotes
STAT1 activation by increasing serine phosphorylation of
STAT1 [34], and also negatively modulates the effect of
STAT3 by activating PI3K pathway [35, 36]. Nevertheless,
it has been unclear whether IFN-γ and TNF-α are able to
modulate the response of G-CSF/IL-6-primed neutrophils
to T-sMs. Intriguingly, our data showed that G-CSF/IL6-primed neutrophils have not lost their responsiveness
to IFN-γ and TNF-α. The treatment with IFN-γ/TNF-α
not only reversed STAT3-mediated modulatory effects
on gene expression, but also abolished the negative
effect of G-CSF/IL-6 on the activation of PI3K and p38
MAPK pathways. Importantly, when G-CSF, IL-6, IFN-γ,
and TNF-α were simultaneously existent, IFN-γ and
TNF-α showed a dominant effect in neutrophil priming.
Therefore, the treatment with IFN-γ/TNF-α enabled
T-sMs to induce anti-tumor function of the neutrophils by
increasing the production and/or release of MPO, NE, and
TRAIL, and reducing the expression of Bv8 and Mmp9
genes.
NK cells can suppress tumor by producing
apoptosis-inducing ligands (TRAIL, FasL) and cytotoxic
granules (perforin, granzyme B) [37]. In addition to
reversing the reactivity of neutrophils to T-sMs, priming
by IFN-γ and TNF-α could enhance the capability of
neutrophils to activate NK cells. Same as the neutrophils
from naive mice, the tumor-promoting neutrophils could
produce more IL-18, and express higher levels of NK-

To further confirm that normal functional NK
cells are in favor of the therapeutic strategy based on
the conversion of neutrophil function, we further tested
the therapeutic effect of local expression of CXCL1/
IFN-γ/sTNF-α in the presence or absence of normal
NK cells. When naive mice were inoculated with tumor
cells, the therapeutic effect of CXCL1/IFN-γ/sTNF-α
was attenuated by depleting NK cells, but recovered by
administrating NK cells (Figure 6A). When pG/pI6-mice
were inoculated with tumor cells, the co-inoculation with
the primed neutrophils and normal NK cells was more
efficient in suppressing tumor growth, evaluated by the
tumor weight and the survival of mice (Figure 6B,C).
We then inoculated pG/pI6-mice with H22 tumor
cells, and treated the mice by local expression of CXCL1/
IFN-γ/sTNF-α and the injection of normal NK cells. The
administration of NK cells significantly promoted the
therapeutic effect of the combined gene therapy (Figure
6D,E). These results suggest that the NK cells with normal
function could indeed enhance the efficacy of therapeutic
approach based on priming of neutrophils by IFN-γ and
TNF-α.

DISCUSSION
Our data in this study showed that priming with
IFN-γ and TNF-α could convert the function of neutrophils
from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressing. The primed
neutrophils not only resumed their potential to release
antitumor factors in response to T-sMs, but also activated
NK cells to more efficiently suppress tumor growth.
Therefore, although the depletion of neutrophils showed
antitumor effect [11-13], reversing the protumor potential
of neutrophil might be a more suitable approach in tumor
therapy because of the important physiological function
of neutrophils. Importantly, the simultaneous modulation
of NK cell function would be necessary for better antitumor efficiency of neutrophils after the conversion of
their function.
The neutrophils in tumor may have differential
states of activation/differentiation, thus taking an
antitumorigenic (‘‘N1’’) versus a protumorigenic
(‘‘N2’’) phenotype [12]. Interestingly, the stimulation
of neutrophils by T-sMs could induce either a “N1”
phenotype or “N2” phenotype of neutrophils, which was
determined by the responsiveness of the neutrophils to
T-sMs as shown by our previous [7] and present studies.
T-sMs may contain most, if not all of, signal molecules in
tumor which might have different effects on neutrophils.
Our data suggest that the final phenotype of neutrophils in
tumor might be actually determined by the responsiveness

activating ligands RAE-1, MULT-1, and H60 after priming
by IFN-γ and TNF-α. These neutrophils were capable
of activating normal NK cells. However, the primed
neutrophils were unable to activate NK cells in tumorbearing mice and pG/pI6-mice. The impairment of NK
cell function restricted the anti-tumor effect of the primed
neutrophils. The impaired function of NK cells has been
observed in the patients with different types of tumors
and murine tumor models [38, 39]. Our data in this study
showed that the increased G-CSF and IL-6 in vivo might
be one of reasons for the impairment of NK cell function.
This finding is also supported by another report that both
cytotoxicity and reactivity of NK cells in bone marrow
was declined by G-CSF [40]. In this study, we were unable
to explain the exact mechanism underlying the impairment
of NK cell function by the increased expression of G-CSF
and IL-6 in vivo. Nevertheless, it has been found that
the altered function of bone-marrow neutrophils could
influence the maturation of NK cells [41, 42], suggesting
that the impairment of NK cell function might be related
to the alteration of neutrophil function in bone-marrow by
G-CSF and IL-6.
Although our data suggest that IFN-γ and TNF-α
could efficiently reverse the function of neutrophils, the
systemic administration of IFN-γ and TNF-α has not been
very effective in the treatment of tumors, probably due to
the systemic toxic side effect produced by these broadacting treatments [43, 44]. Increasing the expression of
IFN-γ and TNF-α by local transfection of expression
vectors might be an alternative approach for neutrophil
priming. Importantly, the combinatorial utilization of
IFN-γ and TNF-α might reduce the requirement for
higher levels of these cytokines in vivo, which might
minimize the side effect. In addition, further study on
the mechanisms underlying the impairment of NK cell
function is required, since the NK cells with normal
function could significantly augment the antitumor effect
of neutrophils. In summary, the findings in this study not
only highlight the reversibility of neutrophil function
in tumor-bearing state, but also suggest that neutrophil
priming by IFN-γ/TNF-α might be a potential approach to
eliminate residual tumor cells in comprehensive strategy
for tumor therapy.

purchased from China Center for Type Culture Collection
(Wuhan, China) and cultured according to their guidelines.

Reagents and Plasmids
Murine TNF-α, IFN-γ, G-CSF and IL-6 were
purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Murine
IL-2 was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). PEconjugated anti-mouse IFN-γ, PE-conjugated anti-mouse
MULT-1 were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego,
CA). PE-conjugated anti-mouse H60 and PE-conjugated
anti-panRAE-1 were purchased from R&D Systems. Antiasialo-GM1 mAb was purchased from Biolegend. AntiLy6G mAb was purchased from BioExpress (clone 1A8).
Plasmids pG, pI6, pCXCL1, and pIFN-γ are
expression vectors carrying the cDNA encoding murine
G-CSF, IL-6, CXCL1, and IFN-γ, respectively. Plasmid
psTNF-α is the expression vector carrying the cDNA
encoding IFN-β signal peptide and extracellular domain of
TNF-α. These plasmids were constructed by the insertion
of cDNA into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) in our laboratory. All of the vectors were identified
by in vivo expression ([7] and Supplemental Figure S12).

Recruitment of neutrophils to peritoneal cavity
To recruit neutrophils to non-inflammatory
peritoneal cavity, CXCL1-expressing hepatocytes
were injected to peritoneal cavity of mice as described
previously [7]. The peritoneal cells were harvested 12 h
later. To recruit neutrophils to inflammatory peritoneal
cavity, 3 ml of 3% Thioglycolate Broth Solution
(containing 109 E. coli bacteria) was injected into the
peritoneal cavity of mice, followed by one more injection
12 h later. Then, the peritoneal cells were harvested 2 h
after the second injection.

Isolation of neutrophils
The neutrophils were isolated from peritoneal cells
or from tissues as described previously [7]. Briefly, to
isolate neutrophils from peritoneal cells, the cells were
washed once in HBSS, layered over a Percoll gradient
54%/64%/80%, and centrifuged at 1060 × g for 30 min.
The dense band at 64%/80% interface was collected as
neutrophil fraction. To isolate neutrophils from tissues,
single cell suspensions were prepared by digesting the
tissues with collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNase.
Neutrophils were isolated by using PE-anti-Ly6G antibody
(eBioscience), magnetic microbeads, and MiniMACS
columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s
protocol. The isolated cells were >90% neutrophils as
assessed by flow cytometric analysis (Supplemental
Figure S13A).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

cells, mixed with 1×106 neutrophils and/or 1×105 NK
cells. For treatment experiments, the mice received
i.m. injection of the indicated plasmid DNA (in 100 μl
saline) every 2 days starting from d1 after inoculation.
Saline and pcDNA3.1 were used as controls. In some
experiments, 1×105 NK or an equal volume of PBS (50
μl) was injected to the inoculation site on d1, d4, and d7
after inoculation. Tumors were dissected and weighed on
d11 after inoculation. Or the mice were monitored every 3
days for recording the survival.
To isolate neutrophils from tumor-bearing mice,
mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 1×105 H22
cells. The mice were used for isolation of neutrophils on
d10 after inoculation. In some experiments, neutrophils
were recruited to the tissue at inoculation site by local
expression of CXCL1 [7]. The tissues at inoculation
site were used for isolation of neutrophils on d7 after
inoculation.

Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). The relative quantity of mRNA
was determined by real-time RT-PCR according to
MIQE guideline [45]. Gapdh, Hprt, and Ppia were
chosen as reference genes. The relative expression
of gene was calculated using GeNorm software. The
primer sequences were as follows: Gapdh, sense

Assay of MPO and NE
The MPO and NE in tissues, and MPO release by
neutrophils, were detected as described previously [7].
To induce the release of azurophilic granules, neutrophils
were stimulated for 30 min with T-sMs (0.5 mg/ml).
Neutrophil degranulation was determined by detecting
the release of MPO. Percentage of MPO release was
calculated as described previously [47]. For the detection
of MPO and NE in tissues, soluble interstitial molecules
in the tissues at inoculation sites were prepared on d7
after tumor inoculation. The mixture of soluble molecules
from tissues was prepared by digesting the tissues with
collagenase and removing debris by centrifugation.
To detect MPO and NE in tissues, soluble interstitial
molecules prepared from tissues were diluted to 0.5 mg/
ml (for MPO) and 2.5 mg/ml (for NE) of proteins. The
activities of MPO and NE were measured as described
previously [48] and expressed as the values of OD (OD450
for MPO and OD405 for NE).

In vivo gene transfection
Plasmids were prepared and analyzed as described
previously [46]. The mice received the injection of
plasmid DNA (in 100 μl of saline) into the muscle tissue
(i.m. injection) at tumor inoculation site or without tumor
inoculation as indicated.

ELISA assay

Animal experiments and treatment protocol

Cell-free supernatants from neutrophils were
harvested after 18-h culture. IL-18 in the supernatants was
quantified using ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN).

To acquire the mice with in vivo expression of
G-CSF/IL-6 (pG/pI6-mice), mice received i.m. injection
of pG and pI6 plasmids (100 μg of each per injection) in
left hind thigh, once every 2 days for 4 times [7]. Plasmid
pcDNA3.1 was used as a control. The mice were used
for further experiments on d10 after the first injection of
plasmid. Naive mice and the mice receiving pcDNA3.1
injection were labeled by N and p3.1 respectively.
In co-inoculation test, mice were inoculated
intramuscularly in the right hind thigh with 1×105 H22

Isolation of NK cells
NK cells were isolated from spleen cells using antiDX5 magnetic microbeads, and MiniMACS columns
(Miltenyi Biotec). The isolated cells were further identified
by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-CD335 (NKp46)
and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD3e. The isolated cells

were >82% NK cells as assessed by flow cytometric
analysis (Supplemental Figure S13B).

Cytotoxicity assay

Palpable tumors were dissected. The mixture of
soluble molecules from tumor (T-sMs) was prepared by
digesting the tissues with collagenase and removing debris
by centrifugation. The concentration of T-sMs was defined
by the concentration of protein, which was determined
using Coomassie Bradford reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

The cytotoxicity of neutrophils and NK cells to
tumor cells was determined as described previously [49,
50]. Brieﬂy, CFSE-labeled H22 cells were incubated with
the effector cells (neutrophils and/or NK cells) at 37 °C
for 6 h. The cells were then stained with allophycocyaninAnnexin-V (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and
analyzed by flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity of NK
cells to YAC-1 cells was expressed as the percentage
of CFSE+Annexin-V+ cells in CFSE+ cells, which was
calculated by the following formula: cytotoxicity % =
(CFSE+Annexin-V+ cells/CFSE+ cells in the mixture of
YAC-1 cells and effector cells) – (Annexin-V+CFSE+ cells/
CFSE+ cells in control YAC-1 cells).

Assay of NK activation
The activation of NK cells was detected by staining
for intracellular IFN-γ. NK cells were labeled with CFSE
and co-cultured with neutrophils in 96-well U-bottom plate
at the ratio of (1:20, NK:PMN) for 12 h. The intracellular
IFN-γ was stained with PE-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-γ,
and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Western blot assay
Western blot assay was done as described previously
[51]. Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA).

Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean value ± SD and
interpreted by one-way ANOVA. Differences were
considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05.

In vivo depletion of neutrophils and NK cells

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

To deplete neutrophils, anti-Ly6G antibody was
used [52]. Mice receive an i.p. injection of anti-Ly6G
at a dose of 300 μg in 500 μl PBS on -d1, d1, d4 and
d7 of tumor inoculation [53]. To deplete NK cells, antiasialo-GM1 antibody was used [54]. Each mouse received
intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg of anti-asialo-GM1 Ab
in 200 μl PBS on -d3, -d1, and d2 of tumor inoculation.
The depletion of neutrophils and NK cells was identified
by Flow cytometric analysis (Supplemental Figure S14).

Neutrophils were stained with PE-conjugated antimouse panRAE-1, MULT-1, H60 or isotype control IgG1
for flow cytometric analysis as previously described [55].
Briefly, neutrophils were stained with PE-conjugated antimouse panRAE-1, PE-conjugated anti-mouse MULT-1,
PE-conjugated anti-mouse H60 or isotype control IgG1
for flow cytometric analysis. Parameters were acquired
on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
Percent staining was defined as the percentage of cells in
the gate (M1) which was set to exclude ~99% of isotype
control cells. Expression index was calculated by using the
formula: mean fluorescence × percentage of positive cells.
