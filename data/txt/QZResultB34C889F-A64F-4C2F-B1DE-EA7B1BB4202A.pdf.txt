Abstract
Activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in many cancers including glioblastoma.
However, clinical responses to EGFR inhibitors are infrequent
and short-lived. We show that the Src family kinases (SFK) Fyn
and Src are effectors of oncogenic EGFR signaling, enhancing
invasion and tumor cell survival in vivo. Expression of a
constitutively active EGFR mutant, EGFRvIII, resulted in
activating phosphorylation and physical association with Src
and Fyn, promoting tumor growth and motility. Gene
silencing of Fyn and Src limited EGFR- and EGFRvIIIdependent tumor cell motility. The SFK inhibitor dasatinib
inhibited invasion, promoted tumor regression, and induced
apoptosis in vivo, significantly prolonging survival of an
orthotopic glioblastoma model expressing endogenous EGFRvIII. Dasatinib enhanced the efficacy of an anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody (mAb 806) in vivo, further limiting
tumor growth and extending survival. Examination of a large
cohort of clinical samples showed frequent coactivation of
EGFR and SFKs in glioblastoma patients. These results
establish a mechanism linking EGFR signaling with Fyn and
Src activation to promote tumor progression and invasion
in vivo and provide rationale for combined anti-EGFR and
anti-SFK targeted therapies. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6889–98]

Introduction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is mutated in many
cancers, including up to 45% of glioblastoma patients (1–4).
EGFR signaling promotes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway
activation and tumor growth and survival (5). EGFR has also been
linked to the invasive behavior of glioblastomas (6, 7). Glioblastoma

cells diffusely infiltrate the surrounding brain, including into the
contralateral hemisphere, limiting the efficacy of local therapies
and rendering complete surgical excision impossible. The antiEGFR antibody cetuximab limited glioblastoma invasion in an
orthotopic xenograft model (8). However, the mechanisms by
which EGFR promotes glioma cell invasion are not fully
understood.
The non–receptor tyrosine kinase Src was one of the first
oncogenes identified, and the Src family kinases (SFK) collectively
regulate a variety of cellular functions in many cancer types
including proliferation, invasion, motility, survival, differentiation,
and angiogenesis (9–11). Src greatly enhances EGFR-mediated
transformation (12–15), raising the possibility that Src and/or its
related family members may be effectors of mutant EGFR signaling
in cancer, including in glioblastoma. Recent work indicates that Src
is frequently activated in glioblastoma cell lines and patients,
suggesting that this family of kinases may be important targets for
therapy in glioblastoma patients (16). However, the mechanism by
which SFKs become activated in glioblastoma and their role in
potentially modifying response to targeted therapies has yet to be
elucidated. Here, we uncover a molecular mechanism by which
persistent EGFR signaling activates Fyn and Src to enhance
glioblastoma invasion and tumor survival in vivo. We show that
Fyn and Src inhibition by either genetic or pharmacologic means
greatly limits tumor invasion and promotes tumor cell apoptosis,
and we show the efficacy of combining the SFK inhibitor dasatinib
with the targeted anti-EGFR antibody monoclonal antibody (mAb
806). Demonstrating clinical relevance, we show EGFR and SFK
coactivation in a large cohort of glioblastoma patients.

Materials and Methods
Microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling with Affymetrix highdensity oligonucleotide microarrays was done and analyzed as described
previously (17, 18).
Global phosphotyrosine profiling. Approximately 1  108 U87MG,
U87-EGFR, and U87-EGFRvIII cells cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum were
stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF (Sigma) for 5 min, harvested, and processed
for phosphotyrosine profiling as described previously (19). Details are
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Fyn and Src: EGFR Effectors and Targets in Glioblastoma
Cell culture. The human glioblastoma cell lines LN229, T98G, U87MG,
and U138MG were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
U373MG was purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. The
primary human glioblastoma lines GM1600 and GM2345 were derived from
patient tumors as described previously (20). All cells were routinely
maintained in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific),
1 penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Life Technologies/Invitrogen),
1 nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 0.15%
sodium bicarbonate and grown at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested in
ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer as described
previously (21). Dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology)–treated cells
were incubated with drug for 6 h before lysis. Details of Western blotting
and immunoprecipitation are described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Small interfering RNA and plasmid transfection. Small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) were kindly provided by GNF. Duplex siRNAs specifically

targeting Fyn, Src, or scrambled control sequences were transfected into
glioblastoma cells using 25 nmol/L TransIT-TKO transfection reagent
(Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were then
lysed for analysis of protein knockdown by Western blot or used in invasion
assays 72 h after siRNA transfection. Fyn and Src cDNAs were generated
by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from U87MG cells, cloned
into pcDNA3.1D/TOPO (Invitrogen), and transfected into glioblastoma
cells using FuGene 6 reagent (Roche). Transfected cells were selected
in 0.5 mg/mL G418 for 2 weeks and surviving clones were pooled for
analysis.
Cell invasion assay. Six-well Transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts
with 8.0 Am pores (CoStar) were coated from the bottom with 50 Ag/mL
growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) or 50 Ag/mL bovine
serum albumin as described previously (22). Full details are provided in

Results
Multiple SFKs are expressed in glioblastoma clinical
samples. To determine the expression of SFK members in
glioblastoma patients, the global gene expression profiles of
41 glioblastoma clinical samples and 19 normal brain samples
were analyzed using Affymetrix U133 human genome arrays. Fyn,
Src, Lyn, Yes, Hck, and Blk were all overexpressed in glioblastoma
relative to normal brain with varying patterns of expression
(Fig. 1A). Fyn, Src, and Yes were widely expressed across all
glioblastomas. Lyn and Hck were largely restricted to a subgroup of
glioblastomas designated type 2B ‘‘mesenchymal’’ (17, 30). Fyn

was most significantly correlated with EGFR gene expression,
particularly in the type 2B subset (r 2 = 0.62; P < 0.001); Hck and
Blk were negatively correlated with EGFR expression. Thus,
multiple SFKs are expressed in nonoverlapping distributions, and
Fyn is most tightly correlated with EGFR expression.
Fyn is a downstream phosphorylation target of EGFR
signaling. To determine if any of the SFKs are EGFR targets in
an unbiased screen, we performed mass spectrometry–based
proteomic phosphotyrosine screening on EGF-stimulated U87MG
cells and EGFR- or EGFRvIII-expressing U87 cells. Fyn was among
the most highly phosphorylated peptides that were differentially
induced by EGFRvIII and EGFR signaling, particularly phosphorylation of its activating residue Y420 (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis
with a pan phospho-SFK antibody confirmed increased activating
SFK phosphorylation in U87-EGFR and U87-EGFRvIII cells
compared with their parental counterparts, which was limited by
erlotinib treatment (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of EGFR Y845, a
Src-activated site, was likewise reduced by erlotinib. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed a physical association between
EGFRvIII and Fyn and between EGFRvIII and the activated form
of SFKs (Fig. 1D). Similar results were seen with highly expressed
wild-type EGFR. This physical association was diminished but not
abrogated by erlotinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To directly determine Fyn protein expression and phosphorylation in glioblastoma clinical samples, we performed Western
blot analyses on 15 glioblastoma autopsy samples from which

patient-matched tumor and normal brain lysates were obtained.
Immunoprecipitation of Fyn protein followed by immunoblotting
revealed elevated Fyn expression and activating phosphorylation in
13 of 15 tumor samples compared with their normal counterparts
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Fyn promotes motility of EGFR-expressing glioblastoma
cells. SFKs have been implicated in tumor cell invasion and
motility in different cancers. To establish a role for Fyn in
promoting tumor cell motility in EGFR-driven glioblastomas,
genetic inhibition of Fyn was studied in a panel of EGFR-expressing
glioblastoma cell lines, including two low-passage patient
cultures. SFK activating phosphorylation of these lines was
highly concordant with their expression of EGFR (Fig. 2A). RNA

interference–mediated knockdown of Fyn significantly decreased
tumor cell migration through Matrigel compared with untransfected cells or cells transfected with scrambled siRNA sequences
(Fig. 2B). Fyn knockdown for each individual cell line was
significantly correlated with its reduction in invasion (r = 0.96;
P = 0.0403; Supplementary Fig. S3). Consistent with this
observation, transfection of Fyn into U87MG cells, which express
low levels of EGFR and Fyn and relatively low SFK phosphorylation
(Fig. 2A), significantly promoted tumor cell migration (Fig. 2B).
Src is also a mediator of aberrant EGFR signaling
promoting glioblastoma motility and survival. Genetic
disruption of Src enhances the efficacy of the targeted anti-EGFR
antibody mAb 806 in glioblastoma xenografts (26); therefore,

Fyn and Src: EGFR Effectors and Targets in Glioblastoma

we examined whether Src is also a phosphorylation target and
mediator of aberrant EGFR signaling. Like Fyn, Src coprecipitated
with EGFRvIII and wild-type EGFR in U87MG cells (Fig. 1D).
Stable expression of constitutively active Src (Y528F) in U87EGFRvIII cells greatly enhanced tumor cell migration, whereas
expression of an EGFR Y845F mutant, a critical site for cooperative
Src/EGFR interaction (26), resulted in significantly diminished
migration through Matrigel (Fig. 2C). Consistent with these
findings, siRNA silencing of Src also effectively reduced in vitro
invasion of EGFR-expressing LN229 glioblastoma cells (Fig. 2C).
These results indicated that Src was an effector of EGFR-mediated
tumor cell migration.
To examine the effect of Src signaling on EGFR-mediated
glioblastoma pathogenesis in vivo, we assessed the effects of
constitutively active Src (Y528F) or dominant-negative Src (K296R/
Y528F) on the growth of s.c. U87 glioblastoma xenografts. EGFRvIII
conferred significantly faster tumor growth relative to parental
counterparts, which was greatly abrogated by dominant-negative
Src (Fig. 2D). The constitutively activated Src allele did not initially
enhance growth of EGFRvIII-expressing tumors but eventually
conferred a modest growth enhancement once the tumors
had become very large (Fig. 2D; P = 0.03). These data show
that Src is an effector of EGFRvIII-promoted glioblastoma pathogenesis in vivo. Moreover, because the dominant-negative Src is
known to affect all Src family members, it suggested therapeutic
potential for Src inhibitors targeting the whole SFK family.
Dasatinib blocks SFK activity and inhibits glioblastoma
invasion. Having shown that Fyn and Src are effectors of EGFRmediated pathogenesis, and not excluding the possibility that other
SFK members may also play a role in this process, we examined the
efficacy of pharmacologic inhibition with the dual Src/Abl inhibitor
dasatinib, which inhibits the entire family of Src kinases. Dasatinib
has been approved for use in patients with imatinib-resistant

leukemias (31, 32) and is being evaluated for use in numerous solid
cancers (14, 33–35). Dasatinib (50 nmol/L) inhibited SFK
phosphorylation in a panel of glioblastoma cell lines, a dose that
blocks SFK activation in other types of cancer cell lines and is
clinically achievable (Fig. 3A; refs. 14, 35, 36). Significant inhibition
of migration through Matrigel was also observed after treatment
with 50 nmol/L dasatinib (Fig. 3B). U87MG cells express very little
EGFR and have very low levels of SFK activation, as noted above
(Fig. 2A), and were relatively insensitive to dasatinib (Fig. 3C).
EGFRvIII increased SFK phosphorylation in U87MG cells and
sensitized them to dasatinib in Matrigel migration assays (Fig. 3C).
To determine whether dasatinib could effectively inhibit
glioblastoma invasion in vivo, we used an intracranial transformed
murine astrocyte model that produces invasive astrocytic tumors
and reflects hallmarks of human glioblastomas (23, 24). These
tumor cells are transformed with SV40 large T-antigen and are
specifically detectable by immunohistochemistry. Treatment of these
cells with dasatinib in vitro confirmed that SFK phosphorylation
could be inhibited (Fig. 3D). Following orthotopic injection, tumor
cells diffusely invaded out of the central tumor mass both as infiltrating single cells and as small clusters of cells, some disseminating
large distances into the opposite hemisphere (Fig. 3D). Dasatinib
treatment dramatically inhibited tumor cell invasion, resulting in
more focally localized central tumor masses with little dispersal of
tumor cells (Fig. 3D). These results clearly show that dasatinib can
block glioblastoma cell invasion into the surrounding brain
parenchyma in vivo.
Dasatinib promotes tumor regression and apoptosis and
prolongs survival in an EGFRvIII-expressing intracranial
glioblastoma model. To study the effects of dasatinib in human
glioblastomas endogenously expressing EGFRvIII, we used another
orthotopic model in which human glioblastomas are excised
from patients and serially propagated as s.c. tumors in mice for

Figure 6. SFK activating phosphorylation
is frequently observed and correlates with
EGFR phosphorylation in glioblastoma
patients. Glioblastoma tissue microarrays
representing tumor and matched normal
tissue cores from 140 patients were
immunohistochemically stained for
phospho-EGFR, phospho-SFK, Src, and
Fyn. Representative staining results from
four spots are shown: a normal tissue core
and three independent tumor cores.
Staining of normal tissues was largely
negative. Some tumors exhibited Src and
Fyn expression but not phospho-EGFR
or phospho-SFK (GBM1). Tumors
exhibiting phospho-EGFR also displayed
phospho-SFK regardless of whether they
expressed Src or Fyn (GBM2 and GBM3).

subsequent intracranial implantation (Fig. 4A). One drawback of
most intracranial human glioblastoma xenograft models is that
EGFRvIII expression and EGFR gene amplification cannot be
maintained long-term in culture; therefore, they are unable to
model endogenous oncogenic EGFR signaling. This system,
featuring luciferase expression for noninvasive bioluminescence
monitoring during therapy (37), has been shown to maintain key
molecular alterations and facilitates preclinical testing of agents on
human glioblastomas expressing endogenous EGFRvIII (38). The
GBM39 line was chosen as it expresses mutant EGFRvIII (25).
Dasatinib treatment of GBM39 cells grown in culture confirmed
its ability to block SFK phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Treatment of
mice with established intracranial GBM39 tumors with a 17-day
course of dasatinib promoted substantial tumor regression as
determined by bioluminescence monitoring and significantly
extended survival (Fig. 4C; P = 0.0002).
Immunohistochemical analysis of treated tumors relative to
controls at the end of the treatment period (31 days post-injection,
17 treatment days) showed significant inhibition of phospho-SFK
and phospho-FAK (Supplementary Fig. S4) at the time of maximal
tumor shrinkage, with resurgent SFK phosphorylation at the
time of recurrence (71 days), suggesting that the effects were
mediated by inhibition of SFK signaling. The treated tumors
exhibited increased apoptosis relative to controls as measured by
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (Fig. 4D) and cleaved caspase-3 (data not shown) staining.
Taken together, these results show that dasatinib can provide
significant survival benefit, promote apoptosis, and reduce tumor
burden of glioblastomas expressing endogenous EGFRvIII.
Combined EGFR and SFK inhibition enhances tumor
regression and prolongs survival of mice bearing EGFRvIII/
SFK driven glioblastomas. Genetic disruption of Src significantly
enhances the efficacy of the anti-EGFR antibody mAb 806 on
EGFRvIII-expressing U87 xenografts (26). This raised the possibility
that pharmacologic disruption of SFK signaling could enhance the
sensitivity of EGFRvIII-expressing tumors to mAb 806. U87
glioblastoma cells expressing EGFRvIII and constitutively active
Src (U87-EGFRvIII-Src) were treated in vitro with mAb 806,
dasatinib, or a combination of both (Fig. 5A; Supplementary
Fig. S5). As expected, mAb 806 did not inhibit the activity of
the constitutively active Src but decreased the phosphorylation
of other SFK members. Treatment with dasatinib alone or in
combination with mAb 806 completely inhibited both Src and
SFK phosphorylation.
Mice s.c. implanted with U87-EGFRvIII-Src cells were treated
with mAb 806 or dasatinib either alone or in combination. mAb
806 significantly inhibited the growth of U87-EGFRvIII-Src
xenografts (Fig. 5B, mean tumor volume at day 24 of 1,500 F
225 versus 200 F 35 mm3 for control and mAb 806, respectively;
P < 0.0001). Dasatinib alone was not effective likely because it was
given at a dose that did not affect tumor growth. However,
addition of dasatinib significantly enhanced the efficacy of mAb
806 (Fig. 5B, mean tumor volume at day 33 of 1655 F 200 mm3
for mAb 806 alone versus 790 F 210 mm3 for combination group;
P < 0.008). Data from survival analysis (Fig. 5C) reflected the
differences seen in the growth curves (Fig. 5B), in which mice
treated with both mAb 806 and dasatinib showed significantly
longer survival relative to the benefit observed with mAb 806
treatment alone (P < 0.0001). These data show that dasatinib
significantly enhances the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy in EGFR
and Src-activated glioblastomas.

SFKs are overexpressed and phosphorylated in association
with phospho-EGFR in glioblastoma clinical samples. The
preclinical data presented above showed that the SFKs are effectors
of oncogenic EGFR signaling in glioblastoma. To determine
whether the signaling relationships uncovered in the cell lines
and xenograft models shown above could also be detected in a
large cohort of patients, we performed immunohistochemical
analysis of two glioblastoma tissue microarrays containing 252
tumor cores and 91 matched normal cores from 140 patients.
Consistent with the reported frequency of activating EGFR
amplification or mutation in 45% of glioblastomas (1), EGFR
phosphorylation was detected in 44% of tumor samples in our
tissue microarrays (P < 0.0001), suggesting that this was a
representative dataset. Fyn and Src expression were both
significantly elevated in the tumor cores relative to the matched
normal brain samples (Fig. 6). More importantly, SFK phosphorylation was significantly correlated with phospho-EGFR in tumor
samples (r = 0.56; P < 1  10 13). Phospho-FAK Y397, a key effector
of SFKs, was also highly and significantly correlated with SFK
phosphorylation in patients (r = 0.71; P < 2.9  10 13; data not
shown). These data indicate that EGFR and SFK are frequently
coactivated and delineate a signaling pathway from EGFR to
SFKs in glioblastoma patients.

Discussion
The inability of EGFR inhibitors to block phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase signaling, either because of PTEN loss, compensatory
activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases, or mutations
rendering kinase inhibitor resistance, suggests that maintenance
of persistent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling may be one
mechanism underlying clinical failure. The observation that genetic
disruption of Src enhances the efficacy of the anti-EGFR mAb
806 (26) raised the possibility that Src is an effector of EGFRvIII
signaling that may also limit response to EGFR-targeted therapies.
The present study sheds light on this question by showing that
EGFR and EGFRvIII physically associate with Fyn and Src and
phosphorylate them on their active site. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Src and Fyn block EGFR-dependent motility and
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, dasatinib
enhances the efficacy of mAb 806 on tumors expressing EGFRvIII
and persistent SFK activation in vivo. These results provide a
compelling rationale for combining EGFR- and SFK-targeted
therapies in glioblastoma patients. Recent work in head and neck
squamous cell cancer cell lines suggests that this may be
generalized to multiple cancer types (39).
The transcripts of multiple SFKs were detected with varying
expression patterns in all clinical glioblastoma samples examined
(Fig. 1A). This suggests that multiple SFKs may be involved in
glioblastoma pathogenesis in a nonredundant fashion. A v-src
transgenic glioblastoma model (40) has suggested that SFKs are
important in the development of malignant astrocytomas. High
Lyn expression in glioblastoma has been described (41), and
Yes was shown to modulate glioblastoma invasion (42). The focus
here on Fyn and Src was motivated by their detection as potential
EGFR effectors in two unbiased screens and does not preclude a
role for other SFKs (Fig. 1A and B). Like Fyn and Src, Lyn siRNA
also inhibited the motility of the panel of EGFR-expressing
glioblastoma cells in vitro (data not shown); thus, its importance
cannot be excluded. Future studies will be needed for a broader
understanding of the biology of each SFK member in glioblastoma

pathogenesis and in mediating persistent EGFR signaling. Despite
the complex expression of multiple SFKs, the pan-SFK inhibitor
dasatinib was highly effective at blocking invasion, growth, and
survival of glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 3 and 4),
suggesting that it is effective regardless of which SFKs are
activated.
Du and colleagues recently described the development of a novel
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation profiling method that identified
Src as a frequently activated, dasatinib-sensitive target in
glioblastoma (16). Similar to the results presented here, dasatinib
treatment inhibited glioblastoma cell migration in vitro and
significantly attenuated growth of orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts. That these similar results were arrived at independently
through completely different approaches strengthens, through
autonomous validation, the finding that SFKs are activated in
glioblastomas and may be targeted with dasatinib. Moreover, the
data described here provide mechanistic insight linking EGFR
signaling to SFK activation and glioblastoma pathogenesis, further
suggesting that combined SFK and EGFR inhibition may provide
added therapeutic benefit.
SFKs are key intracellular components of many signaling
pathways, including those that may facilitate escape from EGFR
inhibition. Phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor
receptor and c-Met by platelet-derived growth factor and
hepatocyte growth factor, respectively, leads to Y419 phosphorylation of SFKs (data not shown), suggesting that platelet-derived
growth factor receptor and c-Met could also maintain SFK
signaling in glioblastomas treated with EGFR inhibitors. Dasatinib
significantly enhanced the efficacy of mAb 806 against EGFRvIII
expressing tumors with persistent Src activation, raising the
possibility that EGFR inhibition alone is not sufficient to fully
limit SFK signaling and to promote glioblastoma regression. Future
studies will be needed to assess whether c-Met, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor, or other signaling pathways contribute to
EGFR inhibitor clinical resistance by maintaining SFK as well as
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. Additionally, there are
likely other mechanisms of SFK activation independent of EGFR as
suggested by the decreased motility caused by Fyn or Src siRNA in
parental U87MG cells with low EGFR expression (Fig. 2B and C).
Like other targeted cancer therapies, it will be important to

determine which patients will likely benefit the most from
combined EGFR and SFK inhibition. Somatic activating mutations
in EGFR are associated with increased sensitivity of non–small cell
lung cancers and glioblastomas to EGFR inhibitors (28, 43, 44);
however, SFK activating mutations are rarely found in patient
tumors. Combined with our finding that SFK activation is highly
correlated with EGFR phosphorylation, this suggests that SFKs are
downstream effectors frequently activated by mutated kinases such
as EGFR or other aberrantly active pathways. Alternatively, the
overexpression of SFKs in the absence of mutation may be all that is
required. The data in this study indicate that patients with amplified
or mutant EGFR coupled with high levels of SFK activation may
stand to benefit the most from combined EGFR and SFK inhibition.
Using a series of cell lines and mouse models, this study shows a
molecular circuitry linking EGFR/EGFRvIII with Fyn and Src to
promote glioblastoma invasion and tumor progression. Clinical
relevance of these findings is confirmed in a large cohort of tumor
specimens, revealing that glioblastoma patients whose tumors
exhibit activated EGFR signaling also frequently display activated
Fyn and Src. These results show that Fyn and Src are clinically
relevant targets and that their inhibition may augment the efficacy
of anti-EGFR-targeted therapies.
