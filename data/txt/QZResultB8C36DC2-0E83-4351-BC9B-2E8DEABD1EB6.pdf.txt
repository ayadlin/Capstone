ABSTRACT
Resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib,
often related to Ras or secondary EGFR mutations, is a relevant clinical issue in NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Although Src TK has been involved in such resistance,
clinical development of its inhibitors has been so far limited.
To better define the molecular targets of the Src TKIs saracatinib, dasatinib and
bosutinib, we used a variety of in vitro/in vivo studies.
Kinase assays supported by docking analysis demonstrated that all the compounds
directly inhibit EGFR TK variants. However, in live cells only saracatinib efficiently
reduced EGFR activation, while dasatinib was the most effective agent in inhibiting Src
TK. Consistently, a pronounced anti-proliferative effect was achieved with saracatinib,
in EGFR mutant cells, or with dasatinib, in wt EGFR/Ras mutant cells, poorly dependent
on EGFR and erlotinib-resistant. We then identified the most effective drug combinations
to overcome resistance to EGFR inhibitors, both in vitro and in nude mice: in T790M
EGFR erlotinib-resistant cells, saracatinib with the anti-EGFR mAb cetuximab; in Ras
mutant erlotinib-resistant models, dasatinib with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib.
Src inhibitors may act with different mechanisms in NSCLCs, depending on
EGFR/Ras mutational profile, and may be integrated with EGFR or MEK inhibitors for
different cohorts of NSCLCs.

mutations (exon 19 deletions, exon 18 variants and
L858R substitution in exon 21) leading to constitutive
kinase activation are found in ∼10–20% of cases in
western countries and are associated predominantly
with adenocarcinoma histology [2–4]. EGFR-mutated
tumors depend on EGFR signaling for their proliferation

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
well characterized mutated oncogene in NSCLC:

and survival: consistently, the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib represent
a relevant therapeutic option for NSCLC patients with
EGFR activating mutations [5–7]. Indeed, mutant EGFR
kinase binds the TKIs more tightly than the wild-type
(wt). Unfortunately, de novo resistance to TKIs is often
observed and virtually all patients who initially respond
ultimately develop acquired resistance. Mechanisms of
de novo resistance include K-RAS (15–25%) or B-RAF
(2–3%) mutations, alterations in the exon 20 of the EGFR
(∼5%), such as the T790M substitution, activation of
phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt or insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling. Acquired
resistance may depend on second-site EGFR mutations
(50%; i.e. T790M), MET or HER2 amplification, PI3K
mutations, activation of AXL, PI3K or IGF-1R pathways,
small cell transformation [8–11]. Alternative strategies for
the treatment of patients after failure of EGFR TKIs are
considered high-priority areas of research [12].
Although EGFR is generally activated through
ligand binding and autophosphorylation of its cytoplasmic
tail, it is well established that Src non-receptor TK, one
of the EGFR downstream transducers, can transactivate
EGFR by phosphorylating tyrosine 845 (Y845); this event
may contribute to full receptor activation [13]. Based on
this evidence, TKIs acting on Src family kinases (SFKs)
such as saracatinib and dasatinib have been proposed as
therapeutic agents for NSCLC; these small molecules ATP
competitors can inhibit kinases beyond the SFKs, and
off-target effects could have biological relevance. Some
studies have described the effect of saracatinib [14, 15]
or dasatinib [16] on cancer cell lines carrying EGFR TK
variants, either wt or mutants. However, disappointing
results from phase I/II clinical trials have so far delayed the

clinical development of these drugs. Although all studies,
conducted in prospectively unselected patients with
advanced NSCLC, showed poor activity of Src inhibitors
either in first and subsequent lines of therapy, some isolated
clinical response have been reported [17–20].
In the present study, we attempted to clarify the
possible role of Src inhibitors in the context of NSCLC
therapy. To this purpose, we used a variety of in vitro/in
vivo assays aimed at better defining the molecular targets
of saracatinib, dasatinib and bosutinib, the three most
clinically investigated Src TKIs. Moreover, we tried to
suggest the optimal combination regimens and the clinical
settings where the different anti-Src agents may better
exert their antitumor activity.

RESULTS
Src inhibitors saracatinib, dasatinib and bosutinib
inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activation
Given the conflicting reports concerning the
capability of anti-Src agents to directly inhibit EGFR
tyrosine kinase (TK) activity [14–16, 21, 22], we
performed an in vitro kinase assay comparing the effect
of the Src inhibitors saracatinib, dasatinib and bosutinib
with that of erlotinib on different EGFR TK variants, both
wt and mutant. As indicated in Table 1, all the compounds
inhibited EGFR variants, but with varying IC50 values
compared to erlotinib. Overall, dasatinib was slightly less
effective than the other agents in this assay.
To better clarify how Src inhibitors could exert
a direct effect on EGFR, we evaluated whether these
compounds could adapt in the EGFR kinase domain

dependent signal transduction. As shown in Figure 2A,
saracatinib was the most efficient, among the tested
compounds, in reducing EGFR phosphorylation on Y1173,
a well-known autophosphorylation site; this effect was
evident in EGFR mutant HCC827 cells. Surprisingly, the
effect was detected also in the EGFR double mutant H1975
cells, although at a very slight degree. The reduction of
pEGFR Y1173 was not found in cells harboring wt EGFR.
Similar results were obtained in the other NSCLC cells
tested (Supplementary Figure S2A); H460 cells were
poorly sensitive to all the tested drugs because of low
EGFR and Src activation (data not shown). In all cell lines,
dasatinib was the most effective agent at inhibiting Src
TK activity (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2A).
In cells expressing wt EGFR (H1299, Calu3, Calu3-ER,
and A549), dasatinib was more effective at inhibiting Akt,
while in cells with mutant EGFR, a greater inhibition
of this transducer was observed with saracatinib and/or
bosutinib (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2A).
Consistent with data from Western blot analysis,
in erlotinib-sensitive cells with EGFR-activating
mutations (PC-9 and HCC827) saracatinib showed antiproliferative effects that correlated with simultaneous
EGFR/Src inhibition. Also in the EGFR double mutant
model (H1975) saracatinib was slightly more effective
than the other two compounds at inhibiting proliferation.
Conversely, in wt EGFR/Ras mutant cells (H1299 and
A549) that are poorly dependent on EGFR activation and
thus erlotinib resistant, dasatinib was the most efficient
inhibitor of cell proliferation (Figure 2B, Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S2B). Consistent
with this finding was our observation that the levels of
Src activation in NSCLC cells are better associated with
sensitivity to dasatinib than to saracatinib or bosutinib.
In fact, linear regression analysis [28] demonstrated that
high levels of Src activation in NSCLC cells significantly

Src inhibitors exert different effects on human
NSCLC cell lines
To further examine the inhibitory effects of the
drugs, we used a panel of NSCLC cell lines with different
levels of EGFR-dependent signaling activation and
different degree of sensitivity against EGFR inhibitors.
As shown in Table 2, this panel includes two cell lines
with EGFR activating mutations (A746_A750del), PC-9
and HCC827 [23]; cell lines with wt EGFR, some of
which harbor Ras and/or PI3K mutations and are thus
resistant to anti-EGFR drugs (Calu3, H1299, H460,
A549, GLC-82); and H1975 cells, containing a double
EGFR mutation (L858R/T790M) that confers resistance
to EGFR inhibitors [24]. We also included Calu3-ER, a
cell line with acquired resistance to erlotinib, obtained
from Calu3 cells through a validated protocol of in vivo/in
vitro selection [25]; Calu3-ER cells display a significant
increase in the expression of activated, phosphorylated
MAPK compared to Calu-3 [26]. The above described
NSCLC cells showed different levels of activation of
EGFR-dependent signaling molecules such as Src, Akt
and MAPK (Supplementary Figure S1). The observed
levels are consistent with the mutational status of the cell
lines and with previous data [26, 27].
When we tested Src inhibitors on these NSCLC
models in comparison with erlotinib, we found that
the three compounds have different effects on EGFR-

moderately inhibited EGFR phosphorylation on Y845 in PC9, HCC827 and H1299 cells, while no effect was detected
in H1975 cells (Figure 3A). Erlotinib also reduced pEGFR
Y845 levels, as previously demonstrated [29, 30]. However,
it has been reported that Src-mediated phosphorylation on
EGFR Y845 does not affect EGFR autokinase activity [13],
suggesting that EGFR Y1173 phosphorylation should not
be decreased by Src inhibition, unless the inhibitors have
cross-reactivity with the EGFR. Consistently, when Src
expression was silenced in HCC827 cells with a specific
siRNA, phosphorylation of EGFR on Y1173 was not
reduced (Figure 3B). Saracatinib in the presence of Src
siRNA maintained its capability to reduce EGFR Y1173
phosphorylation, thus supporting the hypothesis that the
effect on EGFR was direct and not Src-mediated; the same
result was obtained with erlotinib. Conversely, dasatinib
had no effect on EGFR Y1173 phosphorylation also in the
presence of Src silencing (Figure 3B). Levels of pEGFR
Y845 was slightly reduced by Src siRNA. Saracatinib,
dasatinib and erlotinib decreased EGFR phosphorylation at
this site, as expected (Supplementary Figure S4).

correlate with high sensitivity to dasatinib (P = 0.0382).
This correlation was not found with saracatinib or
bosutinib (P > 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S3).
Comparative growth inhibition was also studied in
HCC827 tumor xenografts, as shown in Figure 2C. On
day 63 (9 weeks after tumor cells injection) all tumors in
control group reached the maximum allowed size of about
2 cm3. At this time point, dasatinib produced a tumor growth
inhibition of about 27%, while erlotinib- and saracatinibtreated mice appeared to be tumor free. These latter agents
maintained a potent antitumor activity until the end of the
experiment, with about 99% and 83% of growth inhibition
for erlotinib and saracatinib, respectively (Figure 2C).
Consistently, as shown in Figure 2D, mice treated with
erlotinib and saracatinib did not reach a median survival,
since 70% and 50% of the mice were still alive at the end
of the experiment, respectively. Treatments were well
tolerated; no weight loss or other signs of acute or delayed
toxicity were observed. Western blot analysis on tumor
samples from mice sacrificed on day 14, after 1 week of
treatment, demonstrated that saracatinib reduces EGFR
phosphorylation similar to that observed with erlotinib,
whereas dasatinib failed to do so (Figure 2E).

Saracatinib exerts a direct, Src-independent
effect on EGFR

To better define the role of tumor cell dependence
on Src and EGFR, we tested Src inhibitors in combination
with different classes of EGFR inhibitors at their
equipotent doses. We first evaluated the combination of the
most effective Src inhibitor (saracatinib for PC-9, HCC827
and H1975; dasatinib for H1299 cells) with the anti-EGFR
drugs erlotinib (Figure 4A, 4B, Supplementary Table S2
and Supplementary Figure S5) or cetuximab (Figure 4C,

We then investigated whether the effect of
saracatinib on EGFR phosphorylation could be mediated
by Src inhibition.
Since it is well known that Src can phosphorylate
EGFR on Y845, we first verified the capability of Src
inhibitors to interfere with this event through an ELISA assay
measuring pEGFR Y845 levels. Saracatinib and dasatinib

In wt EGFR/Ras mutant cells (H1299) the
combination of dasatinib plus cetuximab had a lower
effect, either on cell survival and on signal transduction.
Importantly, the combination did not reduce MAPK
phosphorylation/activation (Figure 4C, 4D and
Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, we hypothesized
that MAPK signaling blockade could potentiate Src
pharmacological inhibition in these cells. The combination
of dasatanib with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib strongly
inhibits cell survival in H1299 cells; similar effects were
observed in Calu3-ER, a cell line with acquired resistance
to erlotinib that shows a significant increase in the levels
of activated, phosphorylated MAPK (Figure 5A and
Supplementary Table S4). The combination was highly
synergistic, as demonstrated by the very low combination
index (CI) values calculated according to the Chou
and Talalay method [31] using automated software
(Supplementary Table S5). Consistently, dasatinib
reduction of Src and Akt phosphorylation in conjunction
with selumetinib suppression of MAPK phosphorylation/
activation resulted in strong inhibition of signal transduction
in both cell lines (Figure 5B). The effectiveness of
selumetinib was not observed in the Ras mutant A549 cell
line (data not shown), as previously reported [32].

To further examine the inhibitory effects of
cetuximab plus saracatinib we evaluated this combination
in vivo, in erlotinib-resistant, EGFR double mutant H1975
tumor xenografts (Figure 6). On day 70 (10 weeks after
tumor cells injection) all tumors of mice in the control
group reached the maximum allowed tumor size of about
2 cm3. At this time point, saracatinib produced a tumor
growth inhibition of about 66%, while cetuximab and the
combination reduced tumor growth about 95%. Tumors
of saracatinib-treated mice reached the size of 2 cm3 on
day 119, while those of mice treated with cetuximab or
cetuximab plus saracatinib never reached this size. The
combination of cetuximab and saracatinib caused a longlasting cooperative antitumor activity, as evidenced by
95% growth inhibition (vs 53% of cetuximab alone) on
day 119 (Figure 6A). Consistently, as shown in Figure 6B,
mice treated with the combination did not reach a median
survival, since 80% of the mice were still alive at the
end of the experiment. Treatments were well tolerated;
no weight loss or other signs of acute or delayed toxicity
were observed. Western blot analysis of tumor samples
from mice sacrificed on day 14, after 1 week of treatment,
demonstrated that cetuximab plus saracatinib efficiently
interferes with EGFR-dependent signal transduction by
reducing phosphorylation/activation of EGFR, Src, Akt
and MAPK. The effect on EGFR is probably potentiated
by EGFR down-regulation due to cetuximab-induced
internalization (Figure 6C), as previously reported [24].

EGFR-addicted cells (both erlotinib-sensitive PC-9 and
HCC827 cells and, more importantly, erlotinib-resistant
H1975 cells), the best among the two tested combinations
was saracatinib plus cetuximab: it was able to efficiently
reduce cell survival (Figure 4C, Supplementary Table
S2 and Supplementary Figure S5C) and to interfere
with EGFR and EGFR-dependent activation of signal
transducers (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S5D).
This result was supported by synergy quantification using
the Chou-Talalay method [31]: all the combination index
(CI) values are < 1 for saracatinib plus cetuximab, but not
for saracatinib plus erlotinib (Supplementary Table S3). In
order to show the superiority of saracatinib plus cetuximab
in other models of T790M EGFR erlotinib-resistant cells,
HEK 293 cells (physiologically not expressing EGFR
receptor) were transfected with L858R/T790M mutant
EGFR. The experiments confirmed the previous results
(Supplementary Figure S6).

DISCUSSION

these ATP competitors can inhibit kinases beyond the
SFKs, including EGFR TK variants, either wt or mutant
[14–16]; however, this issue still remains controversial.
By using an in vitro kinase assay we demonstrated that the
three Src inhibitors used in this study are able to inhibit
EGFR TK activity, albeit with different degrees of efficacy
(dasatinib being the least effective EGFR TKI). When
tested on human NSCLC cell lines, Src inhibitors showed
different effects. In erlotinib-sensitive cells containing
EGFR-activating mutants (PC-9 and HCC827), saracatinib
showed the greatest anti-proliferative effects among the
three inhibitors (Figure 2B). This agent was also efficient at
inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation on Y1173 (a well-known
autophosphorylation site) in these cells. Similar results
were obtained in vivo, in HCC827 tumor xenografts, where
saracatinib showed a potent and long-lasting antitumor
activity as compared to dasatinib (Figure 2C–2E). These
findings are of clinical interest, as a recent publication of a
phase II clinical trial reported two partial responses out of

Src inhibitors have been suggested as promising
agents for NSCLC, but disappointing results from clinical
trials have so far delayed their clinical development
[17–20]. Major limitations of these studies may have been
the enrolment of molecularly unselected patients with
advanced NSCLC, and the lack of predictive biomarkers of
response. Populations of patients with different molecular
features could benefit from the treatment with different Src
inhibitors despite seemingly negative outcomes of these
trials, as some clinical responses have been reported. In the
present study, we attempted to better define the mechanisms
of action of three Src TKIs (saracatinib, dasatinib and
bosutinib) in order to aid evaluation of how these agents
could be integrated into current NSCLC therapy.
To this purpose, we used a variety of in vitro/in
vivo assays to clarify the molecular targets of the above
cited agents. In fact, several studies have suggested that

harbored an EGFR exon 19 deletion. More importantly, in
our study, saracatinib was also shown to be an effective
growth inhibitor of the EGFR T790M mutant model in
vitro (H1975 cells, Figure 2B), exhibiting greater inhibition
than erlotinib, bosutinib, or dasatinib. Conversely, in
wt EGFR-containing cells (H1299, Calu3, and Calu3ER, Figure 2B), dasatinib was the most effective agent
at inhibiting cell proliferation, accompanied by efficient
inhibition of Src and Akt. In fact, dasatinib was the most
effective agent at inhibiting Src TK in all cell lines.
Saracatinib has been shown to inhibit purified
EGFR variants in a kinase assay; therefore, we attempted
to determine whether its effect on EGFR Y1173
phosphorylation observed in NSCLC cell lines may be
mediated by Src inhibition. It is well known that Src can
phosphorylate EGFR on Y845, but it has been reported
that Src phosphorylation on this residue does not affect
EGFR autokinase activity [13], suggesting that EGFR
Y1173 phosphorylation should not be decreased by Src
inhibition, unless the anti-Src agents have cross-reactivity
with EGFR. Consistently, when we silenced Src expression
in HCC827 cells, we found that phosphorylation of EGFR
on Y1173 was not reduced. Treatment with saracatinib
in presence of Src silencing maintained its capability
to reduce EGFR Y1173 phosphorylation. These data
suggest that the effect observed in NSCLC cell lines after
saracatinib treatment is not strictly Src-mediated.
Altogether, these data suggest that the three
compounds may act with different mechanisms in
NSCLC cell lines: while dasatinib, as expected, functions
exclusively via Src inhibition, saracatinib showed an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

additional mechanism of action based on a direct EGFR
inhibition. Bosutinib seemed to have an intermediate
behavior, with a certain degree of variability among
the different cell lines. As further evidence for these
distinctions in mechanism of action, levels of activated
Src in NSCLC cells correlated with sensitivity to dasatinib
more than to saracatinib or bosutinib.
In an attempt to overcome resistance to EGFR
inhibitors used in the clinic, we explored several inhibitor
combinations and settings where the different anti-Src
agents may exert their antitumor activity. Based on our
finding that saracatinib as a single agent had the greatest
anti-proliferative activity among the three Src TKIs in
EGFR mutant cells, we tested saracatinib in combination
with erlotinib or cetuximab in in vitro MTT assays. We
observed that, in EGFR-addicted cells (either erlotinibsensitive or -resistant), saracatinib plus cetuximab was
more effective than saracatinib plus erlotinib. While
this result may have poor impact on erlotinib-sensitive
NSCLCs, for which erlotinib monotherapy remains the
best therapeutic strategy, it may have great relevance for
erlotinib resistant NSCLCs. This result was confirmed in
an additional model of T790M EGFR erlotinib-resistance,
obtained by transfecting HEK 293 cells (physiologically
not expressing EGFR receptor) with L858R/T790M
mutant EGFR. Conversely, in wt EGFR/Ras mutant
models, we found that a combination of dasatanib and
the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, efficiently reduced cell
survival and signal transduction, producing a highly
synergistic effect. These data are of relevance based on
the promising efficacy of selumetinib plus docetaxel
combination reported in a randomized phase 2 clinical trial
for K-Ras mutant advanced NSCLC [33].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Xenograft studies with the erlotinib-resistant, EGFR
double mutant H1975 cell line supported the in vitro
result, with the saracatinib plus cetuximab combination
showing a cooperative antitumor activity and prolonged
mouse survival. Interestingly, the effect of saracatinib
on EGFR was probably potentiated by EGFR downregulation due to cetuximab-induced internalization, as
previously reported [24]. Others have found that targeting
EGFR by using two different classes of inhibitors, namely
a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular
portion of the receptor and a TKI able to interfere with
ATP binding, is effective in in vitro models of NSCLC
harboring the T790M mutation; together, these agents
efficiently depleted both phosphorylated and total EGFR
[24]. A combination of the irreversible EGFR TKI
afatinib with cetuximab was tested in a phase Ib clinical
trial in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC cancers, which
had progressed after EGFR TKI therapy. Among 126
patients, a high objective response rate (overall 29%)
was reported, with comparable numbers of T790Mpositive and T790M-negative tumors responding [34].
This study supports the hypothesis that a significant
proportion of tumors with acquired resistance to anti
EGFR TKI remains dependent on EGFR signaling, and
that combination therapies could have a significant impact
in the clinical arena. However, it should be pointed out
that afatinib and cetuximab possess overlapping toxicities
(mainly diarrhea and skin rash) that could limit their use
in patients. By contrast, Src inhibitors, at least based
on data from completed clinical trials, seems to have
a different toxicity profile [35]. It has been recently
demonstrated that the antitumor activity of afatinib
could be enhanced by the combination with dasatinib in
NSCLC models with T790M-mediated resistance [36]. In
addition, saracatinib offers the advantage of simultaneous
EGFR/Src inhibition, possibly providing a further benefit
in terms of tumor growth control and preventing the
onset of Src-mediated resistance to EGFR inhibitors, as
previously reported [37–39]. Therefore, our study may
have relevant therapeutic implications for lung cancer
patients, suggesting an effective strategy to overcome
EGFR drug resistance.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that different
Src inhibitors act through different mechanisms in NSCLC
models that are sensitive or resistant to erlotinib. This
evidence may partially explain the failure of clinical trials
with Src inhibitors in unselected NSCLC patients [17–20].
The off-target effect, particularly on EGFR mutant variants,
could be a main strength of saracatinib in the setting of
erlotinib-resistant patients with EGFR mutations. Moreover,
based on their differential effects, Src inhibitors may better
cooperate with EGFR or MEK inhibitors in NSCLCs. In
this respect, since few therapeutic options are available for
wt EGFR/Ras mutant NSCLC, the combination of dasatinib
plus selumetinib may be a novel, potentially valuable
strategy in the clinical setting.

Compounds
Cetuximab was kindly provided by ImClone
Systems. Erlotinib, saracatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and
selumetinib were purchased from Selleck Chemicals,
Germany.

In vitro EGFR kinase inhibition assay
The EGFR kinase inhibition assay on saracatinib,
dasatinib and bosutinib was performed with an EGFR
kinase mutant profile screening service by ProQinase
(ProQinase GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Briefly,
compounds were tested at 10 different concentrations
(standard range: 3 × 10–10M–1 × 10–5M; semilog
dilutions) against human recombinant wt EGFR and ten
EGFR mutants protein kinases, and IC50 values were
calculated. IC50 values of EGFR reference inhibitor
(gefitinib or erlotinib) were determined side-by-side. All
assays were performed at the corresponding apparent
ATP Km of each protein kinase using the radiometric
33
PanQinase Assay™.

Docking of the Src inhibitors saracatinib,
dasatinib and bosutinib in the EGFR TK domain
The three-dimensional (3D) structures of saraca­
tinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib were drawn using the
Builder tool and generated with Ligprep module within
the Schrodinger package (Schrödinger, LLC: New York,
NY, 2009). The Glide program, of the same package,
was used to dock these compounds into the X-ray
crystal structure of the EGFR TK domain (PDB 2ITT)
[40]. The receptor grid generation was performed for
the box with a center in the putative binding site. The
size of the box was determined automatically. The extra
precision mode (XP) of Glide was used for the docking.
The ligand scaling factor was set to 1.0. The geometry
of the ligand binding site of the complex between the
selected ligands and the enzyme was then optimized.
The binding site was defined as the ligand and all amino
acid residues located within 8 Å from the ligand. All the
protein residues located within 2 Å from the binding
site were used as a shell. The following parameters of
energy minimization were used: OPLS2005 force field;
water was used as an implicit solvent; a maximum
of 5000 iterations of the Polak–Ribier conjugate
gradient minimization method was used with a
convergence threshold of 0.01 kJ 3 mol–1 Å–1. Molecular
graphics were performed with the UCSF Chimera
package. Chimera is developed by the Resource for
Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the
University of California, San Francisco (supported by
NIGMS P41-GM103311) [41].

Analysis of EGFR phosphorylation on Tyr845

Human HCC827, Calu3, H460, H1299, A549 and
NSCLC cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). PC-9 and GLC82 cell lines
were kindly provided by Dr F. Morgillo. HEK 293 cell
line was kindly provided by Dr N. Normanno. Calu3-ER
(Erlotinib Resistant) cells were established as previously
described [25]. All cell lines were authenticated using
STR DNA profiling and maintained in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, penicillin (100 IU/ml),
streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and 4 mM glutamine (ICN,
Irvine, UK) in a humified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2 at 37°C.

Levels on pEGFR Y845 in cell protein extracts
was analyzed by using PathScan® Phospho-EGF
Receptor (Tyr845) Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell Signaling
Technologies, Beverly, MA), according to manufacturer’s
instructions.

RNA interference
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Src was
obtained from Ambion Life Technology (Grand Island,
NY, USA). A nonsense sequence was used as negative
control. For siRNA validation, cells were transfected with
Src siRNAs (5 and 50 nmol/L) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen); 24 or 48 hours
after transfection, Western blot analysis for Src protein
expression was done. For the assessment of siRNA effects
on cell survival and signaling, cells were transfected with
Src siRNA for 24 hours, then treated with saracatinib,
dasatinib or erlotinib for 3 additional hours.

Cell survival assay (MTT)
Cells (104 cells/well) were grown in 24-well
plates and exposed for 72 hours to increasing doses of
erlotinib, cetuximab, saracatinib, dasatinib or bosutinib,
alone or in combination. The percentage of cell survival
was determined using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The drug
concentration producing 50% survival inhibition was used
as a marker of drug effect.

Cells transfection with EGFR vectors
pcDNA 3.2 empty vector (e.v.) as well as pcDNA
3.2 vectors harbouring wt EGFR or the mutant variant
L858R/T790M were kindly provided by Dr F. Morgillo.
For validation of cell transfection, cells (HEK 293,
physiologically not expressing EGFR) were transfected with
empty vector (e.v.) versus pcDNA 3.2 vectors harbouring
wt EGFR or the mutant variant L858R/T790M (5 μg) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen);
24 or 48 hours after transfection, Western blot analysis for
EGFR protein expression was done. For the assessment
of the effects on cell survival and signaling, cells were
transfected with L858R/T790M mutant EGFR for 24 hours,
then treated with saracatinib, erlotinib or cetuximab for 48
hours (MTT assays) or 3 hours (Western blot analysis).

Combination effect
The combination effect of two drugs used at their
equipotent doses was evaluated based on the combination
index (CI), calculated using Calcusyn software (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK) and defined as follows: CI = (D)1/(Dx)1 +
(D)2/(Dx)2 + (D)1(D)2/(Dx)1(Dx)2, where: (Dx)1 is the dose
of Drug 1 alone required to produce an X% effect; (D)1 is
the dose of Drug 1 required to produce the same X% effect
in combination with Drug 2; (Dx)2 is the dose of Drug 2
alone required to produce an X% effect; and (D)2 is the
dose of Drug 2 required to produce the same X% effect
in combination with Drug 1. The combination effect was
defined as follows: CI < 1, synergistic effect; CI < 0.5,
highly synergistic effect; CI = 1, additive effect; and CI > 1,
antagonistic effect.

Nude mice cancer xenograft models
Five week old Balb/c athymic (nu+/nu+) mice
(Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy) maintained in
accordance with institutional guidelines of the University
of Naples Animal Care Committee were injected
subcutaneously (s.c.) with HCC827 or H1975 cells (107
cells/mice) re-suspended in 200 μL of Matrigel (CBP,
Bedford, MA). After 7 days, tumors were detected and
groups of 10 mice were randomized to receive: cetuximab
35 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) three times a week for
3 weeks, erlotinib 20 mg/kg via oral gavage three times a
week for 3 weeks, saracatinib 50 mg/kg via oral gavage
five times a week for 3 weeks, or dasatinib 20 mg/kg i.p.
three times a week for 3 weeks. Animals treated with
DMSO vehicle served as controls. Tumor volume (cm3)
was measured using the formula π/6 × larger diameter ×
(smaller diameter)2 as previously reported [42].

Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
Total cell lysates from cell cultures or tumor
specimens were resolved by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and
probed with anti-human, polyclonal pEGFR Y1173,
EGFR, monoclonal pMAPK, MAPK (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal pAkt,
Akt, pSrc, Src (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly,
MA) and monoclonal actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan).
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Densitometric analyses were performed with Image J
software (NIH).
