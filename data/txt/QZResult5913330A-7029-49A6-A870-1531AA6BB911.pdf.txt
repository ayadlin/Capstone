Abstract
Emerging results indicate that cancer stem–like cells contribute to chemoresistance and poor clinical
outcomes in many cancers, including ovarian cancer. As epigenetic regulators play a major role in the control
of normal stem cell differentiation, epigenetics may offer a useful arena to develop strategies to target cancer
stem–like cells. Epigenetic aberrations, especially DNA methylation, silence tumor-suppressor and differentiation-associated genes that regulate the survival of ovarian cancer stem–like cells (OCSC). In this study, we tested
the hypothesis that DNA-hypomethylating agents may be able to reset OCSC toward a differentiated phenotype
by evaluating the effects of the new DNA methytransferase inhibitor SGI-110 on OCSC phenotype, as deﬁned by
expression of the cancer stem–like marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). We demonstrated that ALDHþ
ovarian cancer cells possess multiple stem cell characteristics, were highly chemoresistant, and were enriched in
xenografts residual after platinum therapy. Low-dose SGI-110 reduced the stem-like properties of ALDHþ cells,
including their tumor-initiating capacity, resensitized these OCSCs to platinum, and induced reexpression of
differentiation-associated genes. Maintenance treatment with SGI-110 after carboplatin inhibited OCSC growth,
causing global tumor hypomethylation and decreased tumor progression. Our work offers preclinical evidence
that epigenome-targeting strategies have the potential to delay tumor progression by reprogramming residual
cancer stem–like cells. Furthermore, the results suggest that SGI-110 might be administered in combination
with platinum to prevent the development of recurrent and chemoresistant ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 74(17);

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other
female reproductive tract cancer (1, 2). The majority of women
diagnosed with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer experience tumor recurrence associated with the development of
chemoresistance, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is
uniformly fatal (3). A new paradigm explaining tumor relapse

involves the persistence of "cancer stem cells" that were
characterized in several solid tumors, including ovarian cancer
(4–6). Although chemotherapy may succeed initially at
decreasing the size and number of tumors, it leaves behind
residual malignant cells, which we hypothesize are enriched in
tumor progenitors or "cancer stem cells."
Ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) have been isolated from
established ovarian cancer cell lines, ascites, and primary and
metastatic tumors (4, 7, 8). They share several characteristics
with normal stem cells, including the ability to form anchorage-independent spherical aggregates, express stem cell markers, undergo membrane efﬂux, form clones in culture and in
addition exhibit enhanced tumor-forming ability (9). Although
a number of technical approaches have been successfully used
to isolate OCSCs (sphere-forming, cell-surface markers, stem
cell gene reporter assays), the use of an assay measuring
aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH) enzymatic activity
has been recently proposed and is used to deﬁne CSCs in
multiple other tumor types (10, 11).
Ovarian CSCs are hypothesized to be largely (or entirely)
responsible for emergence of chemoresistant tumors, because
they possess many of the phenotypes associated with drug
resistance (e.g., enhanced DNA repair, diminished apoptotic
responses, increased efﬂux mechanisms, and quiescent state;
refs. 4, 12). Moreover, similar to normal embryonic or tissue
stem cells, CSCs are believed to harbor a signiﬁcantly altered
epigenome (6, 13), and it has been hypothesized that DNAhypomethylating agents could "reset" these cells toward

differentiation (14). Indeed, several hypomethylating agents
were originally characterized as inducers of cancer cell differentiation (6, 15). However, it has become clear that hypomethylating agents or other epigenetic modulators alone
cannot eradicate relapsed tumors. Preclinical studies from
our and other groups have established the rationale for combining DNA methylation inhibitors with existing chemotherapeutic agents to overcome acquired drug resistance in ovarian cancer (16–20). On the basis of those studies, we recently
completed a phase II trial using a DNA methylation inhibitor as
a resensitizer to traditional chemotherapy in patients with
recurrent ovarian cancer and showed that this combination
has clinical and biologic activity (21), justifying other rationally
designed epigenetic treatment strategies in ovarian cancer.
On the basis of the above considerations, we hypothesized
that hypomethylating agents, in combination with chemotherapeutics, may target drug-resistant OCSCs, possibly leading to
tumor eradication. In the current study, we isolated and
characterized ALDHþ OCSCs from ovarian cancer cell lines
and human tumors. ALDHþ cells were signiﬁcantly more
chemoresistant and tumorigenic compared with ALDH
cells in orthotopic tumor initiating assays. Treatment with
SGI-110, a second-generation DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMTI), resensitized OCSCs to platinum. A model recapitulating the emergence of recurrent tumors showed an
increased percentage of ALDHþ OCSCs in residual tumors
after platinum. Maintenance therapy with SGI-110 during
platinum-induced remission inhibited the emergence of platinum-resistant tumors. We suggest that epigenomic targeting
using SGI-110 may be useful as a "maintenance" clinical
strategy after platinum-based therapy in ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, patient samples, culture conditions, and
reagents
Ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780_CR5, and SKOV3)
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen), with
supplements as described previously (see Supplementary
Materials and Methods; ref. 22). Cisplatin-resistant variant
A2780_CR5 was established from ﬁve-round IC70 survival
monoclonal selection by continuous exposure to increasing
concentration of cisplatin (22). A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cells were authenticated in 2012 by the ATCC. Advanced
high-grade serous ovarian tumors were surgically collected
(IRB-approved protocol IUCRO-0280), enzymatically disassociated, and cultured, as previously described (4). SGI-110 was
provided by Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and cisplatin was
purchased from Calbiochem.
Aldeﬂuor assay and ﬂow cytometry
ALDH1 enzymatic activity was measured using the Aldeﬂuor
assay (STEMCELL Technologies; details can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods; ref. 11).
Cell survival assay
MTT [3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide] assay was used to evaluate both the chemosensitivity

www.aacrjournals.org

of ovarian cancer cells (A2780/_CR5, ALDHþ/ derived from
A2780_CR5) to cisplatin and the platinum resensitization by
SGI-110 by determining the 50% growth inhibitory (IC50) dose
values (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle analysis was conducted as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Sphere and colony formation assays
Sphere formation assays were conducted as described previously (5) and in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Colony formation assay was performed by sorting 500 untreated or drug-treated ALDHþ/ cells into 6-well coated highadhesion plates (Corning). Cells were seeded in 2 mL RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) medium with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals),
1% L-glutamine (Corning), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Corning), cultured for 8 days, plates were washed with 2 mL
PBS, ﬁxed with 3 mL 10% formalin (Sigma) for 15 minutes, and
stained with crystal violet for 5 minutes (0.025% w/v; Sigma).
The number of colonies was counted in each well, excluding
small (<50 cells) colonies (23).
Differentiation assay
ALDHþ cells were FACS sorted from control-treated (100
nmol/L DMSO) or SGI-110 (100 nmol/L per day for 3 days)treated Aldeﬂuor-stained A2780_CR5 ovarian cancer cells, and
50,000 cells then were plated under adherent conditions with
either differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS) or
standard RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, as described (5). The
number of ALDHþ cells on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 was
determined using FACS analysis.
In vivo xenograft experiments
All animal studies were conducted according to a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Indiana University. Female nude, athymic, BALB/c-nu/nu
mice (5–6 weeks old; Harlan) were injected subcutaneously
(s.c.) with 20,000 ALDHþ or ALDH cells sorted from either
SGI-110 (100 nmol/L/day for 3 days) or vehicle (DMSO)-treated
aldeﬂourþ A2780_CR5, and ALDHþ or ALDH were isolated
from three high-grade serous human tumors (1,500 cells per
mouse). Before subcutaneous injection, cells were resuspended
in 100 mL 1:1 RPMI-1640 mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences),
as described (5). Tumor length (l) and width (w) were measured
weekly using digital calipers and tumor volume (v) was calculated as v ¼ 1/2  l  w2. Mice were euthanized when tumors
were >2 cm in diameter or at end of study.
For the carboplatin-response studies, mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 2  106 A2780 cells and subsequently
treated with carboplatin (Hospira) at 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally or PBS (n ¼ 6–9 animals per group) weekly for 3 weeks
beginning 3 days after injection of cells. For the maintenance
study, mice were injected with A2780 cells and treated with
carboplatin for 3 weeks, as described. At the completion of the
carboplatin treatment, mice were randomized to receive SGI110 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle, subcutaneous twice-a-week for 2

weeks (n ¼ 12 per group). Mice were euthanized and peritoneal
tumors were counted, weighed, and volumes determined as
described. Tumors were transferred to tubes containing the
medium RPMI-1640 for immediate isolation of cancer cells, or
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or RLT buffer (Qiagen) and then
stored at 80 C until DNA and RNA extraction.
Isolation of tumor cancer cells and growth of spheroids
Xenografts were minced and enzymatically dissociated
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium/F12 (Invitrogen), collagenase (100 U/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and hyaluronidase
(100 U/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (5).
qRT-PCR
RNA was isolated from A2780, A2780_CR5_ALDHþ/ cells,
normal ovarian epithelial cells (nOSE), and primary tumors
using AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen,) following
the manufacturer's protocol (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
DNA extraction, bisulﬁte conversion, and DNA
methylation proﬁling
Genomic DNA was extracted from A2780 xenografts from
mice treated with SGI-110 or control, by using the QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Sodium bisulﬁte conversion was
performed using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo
Research), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After
bisulﬁte conversion, methylation of CpG sites was determined
by Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina) following a procedure provided by Illumina, at the University of
Chicago Genomics Core, Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery (Chicago, IL). Data quality veriﬁcation and levels of
methylation of the 485,000 CpG sites included in the array were
generated by the Illumina GenomeStudio Data Analysis Software. The Illumina Inﬁnium 450k array was used to analyze
DNA methylation in promoter site regions. The method measures the methylation levels over 482 k CpG probes. The
average percentage of methylation levels were expressed as
b-values and ranged from 0 (completely unmethylated) to 1
(completely methylated). Data have been deposited in NCBI's
Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO
series accession number GSE55613 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55613).
Western blot analysis
Protein extracts from control or treated cells were isolated
and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (24).
Antibodies for DNMT1, ALDH1A1, and GAPDH were from Cell
Signaling Technology. After incubation with horseradish per-

oxidase–labeled secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), protein bands were visualized using the ECL reaction
(Thermo Scientiﬁc).
DNA methylation assay by pyrosequencing
Methylation level for CpG islands of selected genes was
determined by pyrosequencing assays as described (21), following a procedure provided by EpigenDx. Average methylation level for each CpG dinucleotide was calculated to indicate
the methylation levels of each speciﬁc gene.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean values  SD of triplicate
measurements. IC50 dose values were determined by Prism 6
(GraphPad Software), using logarithm-normalized sigmoidal
dose curve ﬁtting. The Student t test was used to statistically
analyze the signiﬁcant difference among different groups by
using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software), P value of 0.05 being
considered signiﬁcant. The genome-wide analysis experiments
were conducted using the Partek Genomics Suite (version 6.5).
The differences in methylation levels between samples (i.e., the
differential methylation levels) were calculated using a mixedmodel ANOVA. The resultant P values < 0.05 signiﬁed highly
signiﬁcant differential methylation levels at a speciﬁc nucleotide site. The analysis built a gene integration network,
incorporating physical and predicted interactions, colocalization, shared pathways, and shared protein domains. The
visualization of the interactions between the genes in the top
functional category was realized using Cytoscape (additional
informatics analysis can be found in Supplementary Materials
and Methods; ref. 25).

Results
ALDHþ cells are enriched in platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer
ALDH activity has been demonstrated to be a global and
well-established marker for OCSCs (10, 11). To determine the
baseline level of ALDHþ subpopulation in ovarian cancer, the
percentages of ALDHþ cells in ovarian cancer cell lines A2780,
A2780_CR5, and SKOV3 and biopsies from chemotherapyna€ve high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients were
examined using FACS analysis. The percentage of ALDHþ in
A2780 was 0.3% and enrichment (P < 0.05) of ALDHþ cells was
observed in the A2780_CR5 (1.07%, >3-fold increase) and
SKOV3 (0.65%, 2-fold increase; Fig. 1A). In primary tumors, the
ALDHþ percentage varied (0.4% to 15%); however, the average
percentage of ALDHþ cells was similar to ovarian cancer cell
lines (3.53% vs. 1.07%; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S2).

Epigenetic Targeting of Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells

primary tumors and the relative increase in percentage of
ALDHþ cells in platinum-resistant cell lines supports the
potential contribution of OCSCs to platinum resistance and
poor clinical outcome.
Low-dose SGI-110 treatment depletes ALDHþ cells in
ovarian cancer
As transient exposure to low doses of the DNMTI decitabine
has been shown to target CSCs in leukemia and breast cancer
(15), we examined the effect of the second-generation DNMTI
SGI-110 on OCSCs. Ovarian cancer cell lines and dissociated
cells from HGSOC patients' tumors were treated with SGI-110
(100 nmol/L for 3 days) and the number of ALDHþ cells was
determined by FACS analysis. SGI-110 treatment decreased
(P < 0.05) the percentage of ALDHþ cells in A2780 (0.3% to
0.14%), A2780_CR5 (1.07% to 0.33%), and primary ovarian
tumors (2.63% to 0.4%), but not in SKOV3 (Fig. 1A), indicating
that low-dose SGI-110 has the potential to target OCSCs in
most ovarian cancer cells, but not all.
To investigate whether low-dose SGI-110 resensitizes ovarian cancer cells to platinum therapy, MTT assays were conducted after treatment with cisplatin alone or in combination
with SGI-110. As expected, A2780_CR5 cells were more
(P < 0.001) resistant to cisplatin than A2780 cells (13.6 vs.
3.4 mmol/L; Fig. 1B), and low-dose SGI-110 treatment
decreased (P < 0.05) the IC50 for cisplatin in both cell lines
(A2780, 3.4 to 1.6 mmol/L; A2780_CR5, 13.6 to 6.7 mmol/L; Fig.
1B). Similarly, ALDHþ cells derived from A2780_CR5 displayed
increased (P < 0.05) resistance to cisplatin compared with
ALDH cells (38.7 vs. 12.2 mmol/L), and SGI treatment
increased (P < 0.05) cisplatin sensitivity of A2780_CR5-derived
ALDHþ cells (38.7 to 6.2 mmol/L), as well as ALDH cells (12.2
to 6.0 mmol/L) but to a lesser extent (Fig. 1B). These results
suggest that ALDHþ cells contribute to chemoresistance and
can be resensitized to cisplatin by epigenetic therapy.
To further investigate the impact of SGI-110 on OCSCs, we
treated ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin (1.67 mmol/L), SGI110 (100 nmol/L) alone or in combination and examined
ALDHþ cell viability. Cisplatin treatment alone reduced (P <
0.05) the number of viable A2780 (1.80  106 vs. 4.57  105) and
SKOV3 (1.50  106 vs. 8.95  105) cells (Fig. 1C), but the number
of A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ cells increased (1.06  105 vs.
1.64  105) after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1C). SGI-110 alone
inhibited (P < 0.001) the growth of cisplatin-resistant
A2780_CR5 (4.58  106 vs. 2.32  106), SKOV3 cells (1.50 
106 vs. 2.92  105) as well as A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ cells

(1.06  105 vs. 6.09  104) and reduced (P < 0.05) the percentage
of ALDHþ cells in A2780 (0.30% vs. 0.14%) and A2780_CR5
(1.5% vs. 0.38%; Fig. 1C and D). As expected, combined treatment with cisplatin–SGI-110 effectively inhibited (P < 0.001)
ovarian cancer cell viability (A2780, 1.80  106 vs. 3.14  105;
A2780_CR5, 4.58  106 vs. 1.18  106; SKOV3, 1.50  106 vs. 2.04
 105) as well as the growth of ALDHþ cells derived from
A2780_CR5 (1.06  105 vs. 5.43  104), and decreased (P < 0.05)
the ALDHþ subpopulation in A2780 (0.30% vs. 0.20%) and
A2780_CR5 (1.5% vs. 0.20%; Fig. 1C and D).
To determine whether SGI-110 restored cisplatin sensitivity, effects of treatment with SGI-110 þ cisplatin were
compared with those induced by cisplatin only. The number
of platinum-resistant A2780_CR5, and A2780_CR5-derived
ALDHþ ovarian cancer cells was reduced (P < 0.01) by the
combination therapy compared with cisplatin alone (Fig.
1C). The total number of viable A2780_CR5 cells was not
reduced by treatment with cisplatin only, and the number of
A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ cell increased after cisplatin
treatment alone (Fig. 1C). The observation that the cisplatin
response of A2780_CR5 and A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ
cells to cisplatin alone was not signiﬁcant indicates that
the effect of SGI-110 þ cisplatin on these platinum-resistant
cells was not simply additive. In addition, modest activity of
single-agent SGI-110 was evident in platinum-resistant cells,
inducing more prominent G0–G1 arrest in the platinumresistant compared with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that low-dose
SGI-110 exerted a chemoresensitization effect. As different
cellular backgrounds likely contribute to epigenetic therapy
response, SKOV3-derived ALDHþ population seemed to be
more resistant to SGI-110 compared with A2780 and primary
tumor–derived cells (Fig. 1C). However, the overall SKOV3
cell population was responsive to the drug, based on
increased G0–G1 arrest in SKOV3 cells treated with SGI110 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken together, these data
suggest that low-dose SGI-110 exerted antitumor and chemoresensitization effects on OCSC.
Low-dose SGI-110 reduces ovarian cancer self-renewal
and clonogenicity
We and others previously demonstrated enhanced sphere
forming and self-renewal ability of OCSCs when grown in
stem cell–selective culture conditions (26–29). To investigate the effect of SGI-110 on sphere formation, A2780 and
A2780_CR5 cells were treated with SGI-110/cisplatin alone

A, 30,000 dissociated sphere-forming cells derived from A2780 cells (platinumsensitive and -resistant) were treated with cisplatin (1.67 mmol/L) or SGI-110 (100 nmol/L) alone or in combination.

or in combination, and tumor-sphere formation assays were
performed. A2780_CR5 cells demonstrated greater (P <
0.001) sphere-forming ability than A2780 (224  20 vs. 54
 13 spheres; Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, SGI-110 treatment
alone markedly inhibited (P < 0.001) the spheroid-forming
ability of A2780_CR5 (224  20 vs. 115  11). The combined
SGI-110–cisplatin treatment inhibited (P < 0.05) spheroid
formation capability of both the parental line and the
resistant subline (A2780, 54  13 vs. 27  7; A2780_CR5,
224  20 vs. 85  12).
To examine the long-term impact of SGI-110 on OCSCs,
spheroid formation and colony formation assays were performed using ALDHþ cells derived from A2780_CR5 treated
with cisplatin and (or) SGI-110 and allowed to recover for 4
days. As shown in Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3, low-dose
SGI-110, either alone or in combination with cisplatin, inhibited (P < 0.05) sphere (30  16 vs. 13  2 SGI-110 or 30  16 vs.
10  5 SGI-110 þ cisplatin) and colony (72  17 vs. 58  5 SGI110 or 72  17 vs. 42  10 SGI-110 þ cisplatin) formation
capability of ALDHþ cells. To further examine the short-term
effect of low-dose SGI-110 treatment on self-renewal, the same
assay was performed on the A2780_CR5 ALDHþ/ cells. Treatment with SGI-110 alone had no effect on ALDHþ ovarian
cancer cell growth rate (Supplementary Fig. S2), eliminating
growth rate as a major contributing factor to the sphere or
colony formation capability of ALDHþ cells. ALDHþ formed a
greater (P < 0.05) number of spheroids compared with ALDH
cells (87  52 vs. 212  97) (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S4), but
no difference in colony formation was observed for ALDHþ vs.
ALDH (Fig. 2E). In addition, low-dose SGI-110 treatment
inhibited (P < 0.05) spheroid-forming capability of ALDHþ
cells (212  97 vs. 112  50; Fig. 2D) and reduced (P < 0.001)
clonogenicity of ALDHþ (113  25 vs. 23  10) and ALDH (90
 17 vs. 18  5) cells (Fig. 2E). Moreover, serial passaging
indicated that ALDHþ cells maintained their sphere-forming
ability over multiple passages, whereas the number of cell
aggregates formed by ALDH cells was reduced from passage 2
to 3 (7.7  1.4 vs. 4.0  1.4; Supplementary Fig. S5). Although
ALDH ovarian cancer cells were incapable of long-term
survival in stem cell culture conditions, the cells demonstrated
limited survival in anchorage-independent conditions by
grouping together to formed loosely adhesive cell clusters
(30). Those clusters were unable to undergo serial passage
and, therefore, were not considered true "spheroids." Thus, the
initial 3-day low-dose SGI-110 treatment inhibited ALDHþ
sphere-forming ability over three passages (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S5).
As A2780_CR5 ALDHþ cells generated a greater (P < 0.05)
number of ALDH cells in DMEM than in the RPMI-1640
medium, and SGI-110 treatment decreased (P < 0.01) the
ALDHþ subpopulation under either culture condition (Fig.
2F). Although A2780_CR5 ALDHþ cells persisted and maintained stemness properties during the initial culture period,
the proportion of ALDHþ cells declined (P < 0.05) by 42 days
in culture (Fig. 2F), indicating that, A2780_CR5 ALDHþ cells
were able to repopulate ALDHþ and ALDH and low-dose
SGI-110 therapy–induced ALDHþ differentiation (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Low-dose SGI-110 blunts tumorigenicity of ovarian CSCs
by targeting ALDHþ cells
To examine the effect of SGI-110 on OCSC tumor formation
in vivo, untreated and SGI-110–treated ALDHþ/ALDH cells
derived from the A2780_CR5 ovarian cancer cell line and
primary patient tumors were evaluated in a xenograft model
(Fig. 3A). ALDHþ cells from human tumors (1,500 cells per
mouse; Fig. 3B) or A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ (20,000 cells per
mouse; Fig. 3C) displayed robust (P < 0.05) tumor-initiating
capacity compared with ALDH cells. Importantly, untreated
or SGI-110 pretreated primary tumor-derived ALDH cells
were nontumorigenic under these conditions (Fig. 3B), whereas 20,000 A2780_CR5-derived ALDH cells exhibited reduced
(P < 0.05) tumor formation ability compared with A2780_CR5derived ALDHþ cells [area under the curve (AUC), 83  124 vs.
1259  44; Fig. 3C]. Furthermore, increasing the number of
ALDHþ/ALDH cells used in xenograft assays accelerated
tumor growth and shortened tumor-initiation time for
ALDHþ and ALDH cells (Supplementary Table S3). Treatment with low-dose SGI-110 for 3 days in vitro (before injection
into mice) prolonged (P < 0.05) the time to tumor initiation and
reduced tumor volume in ALDHþ xenografts (Supplementary
Table S3). To examine the effects of SGI-110 on OCSCs, the
percentage of ALDHþ cells in untreated versus SGI-110–treated A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ/ xenograft tumors was
assessed by FACS. ALDHþ cells were highly enriched (P <
0.05) in the A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ xenografts compared
with ALDH tumors (71.2%  8.7% vs. 1.3%), supporting that
ALDH cells were unable to dedifferentiate into ALDHþ cells.
SGI-110 reduced (P < 0.05) ALDHþ subpopulation (71.2% 
8.6% to 55.8%  0.9%) in xenografts (Fig. 3D).
ALDHþ cells overexpress stemness-associated genes
To conﬁrm the stem-like properties of the ALDHþ ovarian
cancer cells, we examined the mRNA levels of several known
stem cell–associated genes (4, 11, 30). Compared with nOSE,
HGSOCs (n ¼ 5) displayed increased (P < 0.05) expression of
stem cell–associated genes, NOTCH3, OCT4, and ALDH1A1
(Fig. 4A). Importantly, increased (P < 0.05) expression levels
of ALDH1A1 (162.4  28.8-fold), BMI1 (8.8  0.2-fold), NANOG
(9.5  0.8-fold), NOTCH3 (1.9  0.6-fold), and OCT4 (71.4  1.7fold) and decreased (P < 0.05) expression levels of the differentiation-related gene HOXA10 (4.1  0.7-fold) and HOXA11
(2.4  0.8-fold) were observed in A2780_CR5- derived ALDHþ
compared with ALDH cells (Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Fig. S7).
Low-dose SGI-110 induces differentiation of ALDHþ
Methyltransferases DNMT1, 3A and 3B are the main effectors of DNA methylation. Deregulated levels of DNMTs have
been reported in cancer (31) and in ovarian cancer (32, 33), and
in association with platinum resistance. Therefore, DNMT1, 3A,
and 3B expression levels were measured in platinum-sensitive
(A2780) and -resistant (A2780_CR5) sublines and in
A2780_CR5-derived ALDHþ and ALDH cells. DNMT1 was
(P < 0.05) signiﬁcantly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant
A2780_CR5 and ALDHþ cells, and DNMT3A and 3B were
overexpressed in ALDHþ cells, suggesting that aberrant

Epigenetic Targeting of Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells

the SGI-110–hypomethylating effect. SGI-110 also reduced (P <
0.05) the mRNA expression levels of DNMT1 (Fig. 4F), DNMT3A,
and 3B (Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B) and ALDH1A1 (Fig.
4F) in ALDHþ cells up to 14 days (P < 0.05). Three-day low-dose
SGI-110 treatment also resulted in decreased DNMT1 and
ALDH1A1 protein levels in A2780, A2780_CR5, and SKOV3
cells (Supplementary Fig. S8C–S8E). These data support that
low doses of SGI-110 promote differentiation of ALDHþ ovarian cancer cells and suppress their stem-like properties.
Enrichment in ALDHþ cells after platinum in ovarian
cancer xenografts
To test the hypothesis that CSCs persist in ovarian tumors
after platinum-based chemotherapy, we used an intraperitoneal xenograft model derived from parental (platinum-sensitive) A2780 ovarian cancer cells treated with carboplatin or
vehicle (control). Tumor volume, weight, and number of
metastases were signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.001) by weekly
treatment with carboplatin at 50 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). Vehicle and
carboplatin-treated tumors were dissociated to single-cell
suspension at the end of treatment and cells were analyzed
for Aldeﬂuor positivity, and for ability to form spheres in
anchorage-independent conditions. The percentage of
ALDHþ cells was increased (P < 0.001) approximately 20-fold
in tumors residual after carboplatin compared with vehicletreated tumors (Fig. 5B). Cells dissociated from carboplatintreated tumors formed increased (P < 0.001) numbers and size
of spheres compared with cells dissociated from control
tumors (Fig. 5C), consistent with an OCSC phenotype. In all,
carboplatin signiﬁcantly decreased tumor growth in vivo but
also contributed to enriching the OCSC population in residual
tumors.
DNA demethylation induced by SGI-110 delayed
recurrence of ovarian cancer xenografts
To determine whether DNA hypomethylation induced by
SGI-110 prevents tumor recurrence after maximal response to
platinum therapy, mice bearing intraperitoneal A2780-derived
xenografts and treated with carboplatin were randomized to a
2-week treatment with SGI-110 or vehicle (Fig. 6A, n ¼ 12 mice
per group). Treatment with SGI-110 decreased (P < 0.05) the
total tumor weight and volume compared with control-treated
mice (Fig. 6B). Cells dissociated from SGI-110–treated tumors
signiﬁcantly reduced spheroid formation capability in vitro
(Fig. 6C, P < 0.05), consistent with inhibition of stem cell
properties. To demonstrate that SGI-110 induced global DNA
hypomethylation consistent with its DNMT inhibitory properties, Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 arrays were

used to quantify DNA methylation in control and SGI-110–
treated ovarian xenografts. More than 62,000 methylation sites
and 10,000 CpG islands were found to be signiﬁcantly hypomethylated in SGI-110–treated tumors compared with controls (Table 1). The substantial global DNA hypomethylation
induced by SGI-110 in vivo was also demonstrated by a
decrease of 6% in b-values across all CpG islands (P <
0.0001, Fig. 6D) and through unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of methylation sites in control and SGI-110–
treated xenografts (Fig. 6E). To understand biologic processes
represented by the genes whose promoter CpG islands were
signiﬁcantly hypomethylated in response to SGI-110, we
grouped those genes into well-deﬁned functional gene ontology (GO) categories, using DAVID (Database for Annotation,
Visualization, and Integrated Discovery; ref. 34). Of the 84 genes
meeting the criteria (described in Materials and Methods,
Supplementary Table S4), 65 had well-deﬁned GO categories,
and 40 could be grouped into ten functional categories containing at least three assigned genes. These categories represent important biologic processes, including metabolism, apoptosis, proteolysis, cell development, morphogenesis, cell
adhesion, transport, signaling, transcriptional regulation, and
GTPase regulation (Fig. 6F), suggesting that hypomethylation
induced by SGI-110 alters critical pathways in cancer. Genes
included in these networks include PCDH10, a gene known to
be downregulated in cancer through DNA methylation (35),
miR-203 that is epigenetically silenced in myeloma and
involved in apoptosis control (36), PTK6, involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (37), and others.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that ALDHþ ovarian cancer cells
possessing stem cell characteristics are enriched in platinumresistant ovarian cancer cell lines, human tumors, and xenografts residual after platinum therapy. The novel DNMTI SGI110 inhibits ALDHþ cell viability, sphere formation, and
tumor-initiating capacity, represses stem cell–associated
gene transcription, and resensitizes platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells to platinum. In vivo, maintenance treatment
with SGI-110 after carboplatin induces profound global hypomethylation and delays tumor progression. Collectively, our
data suggest that a strategy targeting DNA methylation in
ovarian cancer exerts potent antitumor activity by allowing
elimination of ALDHþ cells enriched in residual, platinumresistant tumors. Our data have several implications.
First, we assert that ALDH1A1 expression and activity
characterizes ovarian cancer cells with stem cell properties,

in agreement with reports from other groups (6, 30, 38).
Aldeﬂuor positivity detectable by FACS identiﬁes the enzymatic activity of ALDH1, a member of the ALDH family that
metabolizes reactive aldehydes (39). Although ALDH positivity has been recognized as a stem cell marker in various
tissues, the role of the enzyme in the functions of CSC
remains elusive. A potential function relates to its regulatory
role in the synthesis of retinoids, which play a critical role in
cellular differentiation. Whether the enzyme has other functions important to the maintenance of CSCs remains not
known. Here, we show that ALDHþ cells derived from
ovarian cancer cell lines and from primary ovarian tumors
are more resistant to platinum, express stem cell restricted
transcription factors, and are able to generate spheres and
tumors in vivo.
Second, we demonstrate that ovarian xenografts residual
after treatment with platinum are enriched in ALDHþ cells,
suggesting that cells with stem cell characteristics escape
traditional cytotoxic treatments. Our model is consistent
with the proposed concept that stem cells elude the effects
of traditional anticancer strategies and can reconstitute
recurrent tumors that become recalcitrant to chemotherapy
(12). We use A2780, a tumorigenic and one of the few
available platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines, to
recapitulate the clinical evolution of ovarian cancer, with
massive initial response to chemotherapy, followed by inevitable resurgence of resistant tumors. Although it has been
suggested that the genomic signature of A2780 does not fully
match that of HGSOC (40, 41), previous studies demonstrated aggressive in vivo growth of A2780 cells (26, 42) and
response to platinum, resembling the human disease. Our
model supports that tumor recurrence could be attributed
to the persistence of platinum refractory stem cells at the
end of initial treatment. We propose a novel strategy to
target these resistant cells through epigenomic reprogramming by using a novel DNMTI. We show that SGI-110
suppressed the viability of ALDHþ cells, their ability to form
spheres in vitro, and their tumorigenic potential in vivo.
Importantly, treatment with SGI-110 resensitized platinumresistant ALDHþ cells to platinum, providing proof-of-concept for further investigating hypomethylating strategies as
means to resensitize tumors to chemotherapy.

Third, it has been recognized that embryonic and CSCs
harbor distinct DNA methylation proﬁles (43, 44) that enable
tight control of cell differentiation and self-renewal capacity.
Therefore, treatment of a stem cell–enriched cell population
with DNA-hypomethylating agents would remove the repressive epigenetic brakes, allowing stem cells to undergo differentiation and leave the pluripotent undifferentiated state.
Although this concept has been tested in leukemia models
(45), it remains unexplored in solid tumors. Here, we show for
the ﬁrst time that the expression levels of all three DNMT
isoforms is signiﬁcantly increased in ALDHþ cells derived from
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells and that SGI-110 is able
to re-set these cells toward differentiation. As histone modiﬁcations have been associated with DNA methylation and
regulation of stemness-associated genes, and an association
between EZH2 and ALDH1A1 expression has been reported
(46), it seems plausible that additional epigenetic regulatory
mechanisms contribute to maintaining stem cell characteristics. Thus, our studies provide the ﬁrst proof-of-principle that
epigenomic strategies efﬁciently target ovarian cancer stem
cells.
Our results also demonstrate that SGI-110 induces profound
hypomethylation in vivo, with tens of thousands of CpG sites
becoming demethylated in response to treatment. A distinctly
hypomethylated DNA proﬁle emerges, providing reassurance
that the novel DNMTI hits its biologic targets in solid tumors in
vivo. Future studies will strive to identify the critical genes or
pathways responsible for tumor growth inhibition and chemotherapy resensitization in response to this DNMT inhibitor.
It is likely that not a single gene, or pathway, but a complex
program is reengaged by targeting the epigenome, as we show
here by pathway analyses.
Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with SGI-110 after
platinum decreases recurrent tumor burden in a platinumsensitive ovarian cancer intraperitoneal xenograft model
that recapitulates ﬁrst the response to therapy, and second
the recurrence of disease after chemical debulking using
carboplatin. These data support exploring maintenance treatment with a hypomethylating agent after maximal response
induced by traditional treatment. Maintenance strategies after
chemotherapy have been investigated with variable level of
success in ovarian cancer (47–49) and remain an area of active
