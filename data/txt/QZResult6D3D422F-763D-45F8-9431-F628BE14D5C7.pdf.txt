ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma are the two most common types of Bone
Sarcomas, principally localized at the long bones of the extremities and mainly
affecting adolescents and young adults. Cisplatin is one of the current options in the
therapeutic arsenal of drugs available to cure these aggressive cancers. Unfortunately,
chemoresistance against this agent is still a major cause of patient relapse. Thus, a
better understanding of the molecular pathways by which these drugs induce cancer
cell death, together with a better delineation of the origins of chemoresistance are
required to improve the success rate of current treatments. Furthermore, as p53 is
frequently mutated in Bone Sarcomas, other pathways in these cancers must mediate
drug-induced cell death. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TAp73β, a
p53-family protein, is implicated in Cisplatin-induced apoptosis of Bone Sarcomas’.
Furthermore, while acquired resistance developed by cancer cells against such
drugs can have multiple origins, it is now well accepted that epigenetic mechanisms
involving microRNAs (miRNAs) are one of them. We show that miRNA-193a-5p
modulates the viability, the clonogenic capacity and the Cisplatin-induced apoptosis
of the Bone Sarcoma cells through inhibition of TAp73β. Collectively, these results
shed light on the involvement of miR-193a-5p in Cisplatin chemoresistance of Bone
Sarcomas’, and they open the road to new therapeutic opportunities provided by
targeting the miR-193a-5p/TAp73β axis in the context of these malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

gene is altered in about 50% of the patients [3, 4]. With
approximately 225 new cases diagnosed per year in
the United-States, Ewing Sarcoma is the second most
common Bone cancer after Osteosarcoma [5]. It displays
an incidence peak around 15 years of age and a slight
prevalence in males [6, 7]. In 85% of the cases, Ewing
Sarcoma is outlined by the chromosomal translocations
t(11;22)(q24;12), giving rise to the chimeric transcription
factor EWS-Fli1, whose the oncogenic features are well
documented [8]. In addition, a mutational hot-spot of p53
was suggested in Ewing Sarcoma, as the same missense
mutation at codon 176 was found in several samples from
primary tumors [9].
Presently, the standard of care for young patients
suffering from Bone Sarcomas is based on a multimodal

While they are relatively uncommon cancers,
Osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma are the two most
frequent types of Primary Bone Sarcomas, affecting
both children and young adults. Resulting from a boneremodeling processes’ deregulation, these aggressive
tumors mainly arise at the long bones of the extremities,
and are characterized by an ectopic and anarchic osteoid
neo-formation associated with osteolysis. With an
incidence of 4 to 5 cases per million and a peak around 18
years old, Osteosarcoma is by far the most common type
of these neoplasms [1, 2]. Although no specific genetic
lesions have been uncovered until now to distinguish
these tumors, the locus of the tumor suppressor p53

therapy including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and surgical
resection, together with local radiotherapy and adjuvant
chemotherapy [5, 10]. Such treatments have markedly
improved the outcomes of the patients worldwide, since
the 5-year survival rates after treatment approach 60-70%
for the localized forms. Unfortunately, chemoresistance,
tumor burden and pulmonary metastases at the time of
diagnosis all confer a very poor prognosis, and survival
rates drop to around 30% in these cases [11]. The
unsatisfactory outcomes for such patients and the toxicity
-based limitations of current chemotherapeutic agents
both underscore the urgency of finding novel therapeutic
strategies. In this context, there is a real need to better
understand the relevant drug-induced cell death processes
and chemoresistance-related mechanisms.
The P73 gene is a member of the P53-related
transcription factor family. It plays a crucial role during
embryonic development and tumor progression, through
mechanisms involving control of the genome stability and
chemosensitivity [12-17]. Although P53 and P73 display
a common architecture, with several highly homologous
domains, different promoters and alternative splicings
contribute to the generation of a considerable number
of distinct P73 isoforms. Longer isoforms bearing the
trans-activating N-terminal domains are called the TA
isoforms and mimic the tumor-suppressor function of
p53 through their ability to trans-activate apoptotic
transcriptional target-genes such as p21, Noxa or PUMA
[18]. On the contrary, the ΔNp73 isoforms, lacking the TA
domain, have a rather dominant-negative function [19].
Although P53 is mutated or inactivated in about 50% of
the human cancers, it is rarely the case for P73, making
it a potent drug-induced-cell-death mediator [20, 21]. It
is thus noteworthy that the expression of P73 modulates
chemosensitivity of several cancer types. Nonetheless, this
feature remains to be investigated in the Bone Sarcomas’
context [22].
It has already been established that miRNA-193a-5p
is implicated in P73 regulation [23]. miRNAs are small
non-coding RNAs involved in the post-transcriptional
regulation of the gene expression. As they act as key
regulators of multiple target-genes, they are able to finetune various physiological processes and are aberrantly
deregulated in several diseases including cancers [24-26].
These features together with their substantial stability
could therefore make them potent bio-markers, novel
targets or powerful drugs [27]. We have already described
that the TAp73β isoform is a mediator of Cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
model [23]. Additionally, we also demonstrated that
through modulating the expression of TAp73β, the miR193a-5p was a key component of an endogenous Cisplatinchemoresistance mechanism. In this study, we sought to
determine if the TAp73β/miR-193a-5p axis could also be
implicated in the Cisplatin-resistance of Bone Sarcomas.
We observed that inhibiting TAp73β reduces the caspase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity and increases both the clonogenic features and the
cell’s Cisplatin-resistance. Moreover, blocking the Bone
Sarcoma cells’ endogenous miR-193a-5p expression
reverses such effects, leading to Cisplatin-sensitization.
Such results shed light on the role of the miR-193a-5p in
the Bone Sarcomas’ Cisplatin-chemoresistance and open
the road to new therapeutic opportunities provided by its
targeting in an attempt to improve the outcome of these
pediatric cancers.

RESULTS
Human Bone Sarcoma cells express TAp73β and
the miR-193a-5p and are Cisplatin- sensitive
To directly assess the relevance of studying the
TAp73β/miR-193a-5p axis in the drugs-resistance
mechanisms of Bone Sarcomas, we first evaluated the
expression of TAp73β at mRNA level and the miR-193a5p’s expression in seven Osteosarcoma cell lines and in
seven Ewing Sarcoma cell lines (Figure 1a, 1b). As the
JHU-029 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells were
previously used as a model to study the p63/miR193a5p/p73 axis, they were included in our screening and
serves as a control [23]. All the cell lines express TAp73β
except the CAL-72 one, potentially because it is the only
Osteosarcoma cell line of our panel displaying a wild-type
and functional p53 status (Figure 1a, Supp. Figure 1). In
addition, the 143B cell line displays the highest expression
of this apoptotic factor. It is indeed about 50% more
elevated than in the JHU-029 carcinoma cells previously
presented as over-expressing it [23]. The SaOS2, SJSA1, HOS, EW24 and SKES-1 cells display an intermediate
expression level, whereas this transcription factor is
barely detectable in the other cell lines. The miR-193a-5p
is expressed in all the cell lines tested, but significantly
more in the Osteosarcoma cells compared to the Ewing
Sarcoma ones (Figure 1b). These results strongly suggest
the implication of the miR-193a-5p in Osteosarcomaspecific cellular processes but nevertheless fully justify
pursuing this work in both Bone Cancer types in order
to assess the impact of such discrepancy in the drugresistances’ context. The same Bone Sarcoma cells’ panel
was treated with Cisplatin to assess its effects on the cell
viability (Figure 1c, 1d, 1e). A concentration-dependent
inhibition of cell viability was observed in all the cell lines
studied with important variability of the GI50. The Ewing
Sarcoma cells A673, EW24 and IOR/BRZ are the more
sensitive ones as they exhibited GI50 between 1.472 and
2.296 µM (Figure 1d, 1e). With GI50 comprise between
4.067 and 11.95 µM, the SJSA-1, CAL-72, 143B, HOS,
U2OS, TC32, RDES, TC71 and SKES-1 cells display an
intermediate sensitivity. In contrast, the MG63 and SaOS2
cell lines are twenty to forty times less sensitive compared

with the first ones, with a GI50 of 24.85 µM and around
45.57 µM respectively. Interestingly, those two cell lines
are the ones displaying the highest miR-193a-5p levels
(Figure 1b). A statistically significant correlation was
found between the GI50 and the miR-193a-5p expression
level in all the cell lines, reinforcing the hypothesis
of the miR-193a-5p’s involvement in the Cisplatinchemoresistance in such model (Figure 1f). In addition,
a non-significant higher global average GI50 is observed
in the Osteosarcoma compared with the Ewing Sarcoma
cells (Figure 1g). Interestingly, a significant higher global
expression of the miR was also found in the Osteosarcoma
cell lines compared with the Ewing Sarcoma ones (Figure
1h), arguing again in favor of its presumed implication in
the Cisplatin-chemoresistance. Following investigations
were thus based on the hypothesis that a high miR193a-5p expression could induce a high Cisplatinchemoresistance due to the miRNA-inhibitor’s effects on
TAp73β’s expression. The cell lines were thus chosen for
further analysis based on their TAp73β and miR-193a-5p
expression levels.

its direct targets are strongly increased in these conditions.
Similar results were observed in the SJSA-1 cells except
for MDM2 expression (Supp. Figure 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d). Those
two cell lines were picked because of their relatively low
TAp73β expression level allowing and easier activation
observation. These results highlight the inhibitory effect
of the Cisplatin on the expression of the miR-193a-5p, but
the exact underlying mechanism needs to be investigated.

TAp73β-mediated Cisplatin sensitivity of human
Bone Sarcomas
In order to better delineate to what extent TAp73β
is implicated in the Cisplatin-response of Bone Sarcoma
cells, TAp73 was down-regulated with siRNAs in
the RDES Ewing Sarcoma cell line used in Figure 2
(with a low TAp73β expression level) and in the 143B
Osteosarcoma one because they express the highest
TAp73β level of all the cell lines tested (Figure 3a and
Supp. Figure 3a). According to the tumor suppressive
functions of TAp73 [28], the consequent 50% reduction
of TAp73β’s expression obtained in the RDES cell line
(Figure 3a) leads to a significant diminution of its caspase
3/7 activity, supporting the implication of the TAp73β
isoform in the apoptotic processes in these cells (Figure
3b). Moreover, these results are linked to the improved
clonogenic capabilities observed in these conditions, as
the TAp73si-cells were able to form about 2.5 times more
clones in 2D than the GFPsi ones (Figure 3c). In addition,
the implication of TAp73 in the Cisplatin-sensitivity of the
RDES cells was highlighted by the fact that a reducedTAp73 expression in those cells contributes to reduce their
sensitivity to Cisplatin in a viability assay (Figure 3d). The
same effects were confirmed in the 143B Osteosarcoma
cells after TAp73 inhibition, even if this cell line displays
the highest TAp73β expression level compared with the
other cell lines (Supp. Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and Figure 1a).
Together, these data support the implication of TAp73 in

Cisplatin modulates the expression level of the
miR-193a-5p, TAp73β and its target-genes in
Bone Sarcoma cells
To better understand to what extent the miR-193a5p/TAp73β axis is involved in the Cisplatin-response of
the Bone Sarcoma cells, the RDES Ewing Sarcoma cell
line and the SJSA-1 Osteosarcoma one were treated or
not with 3 µM Cisplatin during twenty-four hours and the
expression levels of the miR-193a-5p, TAp73β and two of
its target-genes, p21 and MDM2 were assessed by qRTPCR (Figure 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and Supp. Figure 2a, 2b, 2c,
2d). In the RDES cells, we can notice that the Cisplatin
induces a down-regulation of the miR-193a-5p from
about 82% compared with the non-treated control cells.
As expected, the expression levels of TAp73β and two of

that this gene is related to the Cisplatin-sensitivity in the
Bone Sarcoma cells. These results raise the question
of the implication of the miR-193a-5p in the Cisplatinchemoresistance though its ability to regulate TAp73β.

the opportunity to easily increase the miR-193a-5p’s
expression level by transient transfections of pre-miRNAs
and make them interesting models in the context of
our study. The pre-miR-193a-5p was thus transiently
transfected and the cells were treated forty-eight hours
later with Cisplatin (Figure 4 and Supp. Figure 4). The
transfection’s efficiency was validated by qRT-PCR in both
cell lines (Figure 4a and Supp. Figure 4a). The consequent
expected down-regulation of TAp73β, p21 and MDM2
was also verified at transcriptional level (Figure 4b, 4c,
4d and Supp. Figure 4b, 4c, 4d). In absence of Cisplatin,
increasing the miR-193a-5p’s expression induces a slight
reduction in the caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 4e and Supp.
Figure 4e), corroborating the previous results obtained
after reducing the expression of TAp73 (Figure 3b and
Supp. Figure 3b). The same effect is observed after a 3
µM Cisplatin-treatment. Increasing the miR-193a-5p’s
expression significantly reduces the caspase 3/7 activity by
14.13 and by 13.23% in the RDES and in the SJSA-1 cells

The TAp73β’s targeting miR-193a-5p is
implicated in the Cisplatin chemoresistance of
human Bone Sarcomas
To assess the impact of the miR-193a-5p in the
Cisplatin-resistance, its overexpression was performed
in the RDES Ewing Sarcoma cell line and in the SJSA1 Osteosarcoma one. These two cell lines display a nonfunctional p53 protein, weakly express both TAp73β
and the miR-193a-5p and exhibit the same intermediate
Cisplatin sensitivity as shown by their equivalent GI50
(Figure 1 and Supp. Figure 1). Such features raise

of TAp73β was evaluated by qRT-PCR in the RDES Ewing Sarcoma cell line, after infecting the cells with viral-supernatant of GFPsi

pictures of the wells in each condition were chosen. An unpaired Student’s t-test was used to compare the different conditions in the caspase
3/7 activity assays and in the clonogenic assays. d. The same cells in the same conditions as in (a) were cultured for 48 h in the presence of
Cisplatin at the indicated concentrations and cell viability was determined by WST-1 assay. The viability of the non-treated control of each

respectively. Inducing the expression of the miR-193a-5p
also reduces the Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage induced by the Cisplatin (Figure 4f and Supp.
Figure 4f) and improves the cell viability after only two
hours of Cisplatin treatment in both cell lines (Figure 4g
and Supp. Figure 4g). Taking together, these results argue
for the anti-apoptotic role of the miR-193a-5p, through its
TAp73β’s targeting capabilities and strongly support its
implication in the Cisplatin-chemoresistance in this model.

their weak basal TAp73b’s expression level compared
with all the Bone Sarcoma cell lines previously screened
(Figure 1). Regarding those features, this cell line appears
as the best model to follow this strategy. To assess the
implication of TAp73β in the Cisplatin-chemoresistance
in this cell line, the cells were first transiently transfected
with a TAp73β coding vector only. The efficiency of the
transfection was validated by qRT-PCR, as the expression
of TAp73β was about five thousand times more elevated
in the TAp73β-transfected cells than in the control ones
(Figure 5a left panel). These results were also confirmed
at protein level, however in a lower extent (Figure 5a
right panel). Such increase has a functional effect on the
cell viability, increasing the cell sensitivity in response
to a four-days Cisplatin treatment at each concentration
tested (Figure 5b). Moreover, increasing the expression
of TAp73β markedly improve the Cisplatin-induced
caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 5c). Nonetheless, increasing
the expression of the TAp73β-targeting miR-193a-5p
significantly decreases the caspase 3/7 activities by

the Cisplatin sensitivity of Bone Sarcoma cells through
targeting TAp73β, a modulation of the expression level of
both partners was performed. The MG63 cells display one
of the highest basal Cisplatin chemoresistance, probably
due to their elevated miR-193a-5p’s expression level and

expression of the miR-193a-5p counteracts the Cisplatinchemo-sensitizing effects of TAp73β on the cell viability
(Figure 5d).

193a-5p and the efficiency of transfection was validated
by qRT-PCR (Figure 6a). As expected, the expression of
TAp73β and two of its target-genes (p21 and MDM2)
was increased (Figure 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e). The functional
consequence of such modulation was assessed on the
caspase 3/7 activities and on the clonogenic capabilities
of those cells (Figure 6f, 6g). Without Cisplatin-treatment,
inhibiting the expression of the miR only leads to a slight
non significant increase of the caspase activity (Figure 6f)
but significantly decreases the cell colony-forming ability
(Figure 6g). In addition, inhibiting the expression of the
miR-193a-5p potentiates the effects of the Cisplatin on
the cell viability, significantly sensitizing the cells to this
agent (Figure 6h). In addition, the use of the anti-miR193a-5p also displays a chemo-sensitizer’s effect both on
the 143B Osteosarcoma and the RDES Ewing Sarcoma
cells, in which the expression of TAp73β was artificially
reduced (Supp. Figure 5a and b). Taken together, these

As TAp73β is a target of the miR-193a-5p, we
hypothesized that decreasing the endogenous expression
level of this miR may have the same consequences on
the Cisplatin-sensitivity than over-expressing TAp73β.
We then tested our sensitizing strategy on the partially
Cisplatin-resistant cell line MG63, moreover expressing
high level of miR-193a-5p. The MG63 cells were thus

origins of the acquired drug-resistance can be multiple, but
a progressive loss of expression of tumor-suppressor genes
along the treatment-course often occurs in cancer cells.
As these genes normally sense the genotoxic stress or
mediate the drug-induced apoptotic response, such cancer
cells can overcome the chemotherapeutic agents’ effects.
Beyond the mutational processes that can affect such
tumor-suppressor’s expression or activity, their silencing
by the miRNAs is an epigenetic mechanism that has been
well accepted to deregulate the drug-resistance-related
genes. Unfortunately, only a few studies are available in

used as housekeeping genes for qRT-PCR and actin serves as Immunoblotting’s loading control. The expression of p21 d. and MDM2 e.
were assessed by qRT-PCR in the same conditions as described in (a). β2-microglobulin was used as housekeeping genes for qRT-PCR. For
the qRT-PCR experiments, error bars show the standard deviation for n = 3 measurements from representative experiments. f. The basal
apoptosis level was then evaluated by dosage of the caspase 3/7 activity in protein extracts from the same cells and in the same conditions as
in (a). Error bars show the standard deviation for n = 3 measurements from representative experiments. g. The basal clonogenic capabilities
of the cells were evaluated in the same cells and in the same conditions as in (a). One thousand cells were seeded in 6-wells plates and
incubated until the possibility of macroscopic clones counting. The cells were then fixed in glutaraldehyde and stained with Crystal Violet.
Error bars show the standard deviation for n = 3 measurements from representative experiments. Representative pictures of the wells in
each condition were chosen. A two-tailed paired Student’s t-test was used to compare the different conditions in the caspase 3/7 activity
assays and in the clonogenic assays. h. MG63 Osteosarcoma cell line was transiently transfected with either the anti-miR control or the
anti-miR-193a-5p and was cultured forty-eight hours later in the presence of Cisplatin at the indicated concentrations for two hours. The
cell viability was determined by WST-1 assay and compared with control. The viability of the non-treated control was assigned as 100%.
A two-way ANOVA test was used to compare the different conditions in the viability assays.

the Bone Sarcoma’s context and the precise functions of
these molecules still need to be deciphered. For instance,
the miR-34c was reported to be decreased in Cisplatinpoor responders’ Osteosarcoma patients compared to good
ones51.
Here, we report that the p53-related tumorsuppressor gene TAp73β is implicated in the Cisplatininduced apoptosis of Bone Sarcomas and that the
miRNA-193a-5p, through its TAp73β’s targeting ability,
consequently modulates the Cisplatin-sensitivity of
these cancers. Interestingly, we have highlighted that
this mechanism occurs both in Osteosarcoma and Ewing
Sarcoma, even if the global expression levels of TAp73β
and the miRNA-193a-5p are lower in Ewing Sarcoma
(Figure 1a, 1b). The difference in the global expression
level of TAp73β between these two models might be
explained by the osteoblastic-origin of Osteosarcoma and
by the requirement of p73 during the vitamin D-mediated
osteoblastic differentiation [29]. In addition, this difference
could also be supported by the fact that human bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cells, which are the cells of
origin of Ewing Sarcoma, display a silenced-expression of
the p73 gene through the hypermethylation of its promoter
[30]. Furthermore, according to both its p53-related role
and pro-apoptotic functions, the expression of TAp73
is often higher in a p53-functionnally deficient cellularbackground [31]. This is in agreement with the wildtype p53 status of the CAL-72 Osteosarcoma cell line,
in which no TAp73β expression was detectable (Figure
1a and Supp. Figure 1). In addition, even if the miRNA193a-5p is poorly documented in the Bone context, the
expression of this miR appears to decrease during the
osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem
cells [32]. However, the miR-193a-3p was reported to be
five times more elevated in the MG63 Osteosarcoma cell
line than in the HOB osteoblasts, letting presuming here
of its oncogenic role [33].
Additionally, this study reports for the first time the
inhibitory effect of the Cisplatin on the miR-193a-5p’s
expression of Bone Sarcomas. As a consequence, the
expression of the pro-apoptotic factor TAp73β and two
of its target-genes, p21 and MDM2 are increased (Figure
2 and Supp. Fig.2). Our results are in accordance with a
previous work, demonstrating that increasing TAp73β’s
expression leads to a rapid and robust up-regulation of
p21 in the SaOS2 Osteosarcoma cell line [34]. Through
overexpression and knockdown experiments, we found
that TAp73β is implicated in the regulation of both the
caspase 3/7 activity and the clonogenic capabilities of
the Bone Sarcoma cells. Thus, such involvement in
these cellular processes functionally confers to TAp73β
a mediator role in the Cisplatin-induced apoptosis of the
Bone Sarcomas. These results corroborate recent studies,
which have also demonstrated the role of p73 in the
Cisplatin-related apoptosis in several models [35, 36].
Regarding its p53-redundant-functions, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

epigenetic regulation of TAp73β through miRNAs has
already been described and interestingly, even if in silico
analysis predicts that the miRs -125b, -486-3p and -34a
could potentially target TAp73 [37], only the miR-193a5p was validated as a direct bona-fide TAp73β’s repressor
[23]. Through modulating the miR-193a-5p’s expression
level, we highlighted its implication in the Cisplatinchemoresistance of the Bone Sarcoma cells, as previously
shown in a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma model
[23]. In contradiction with our results (Figure 4e, 5c, 6f
and Supp. Figure 4e), it was interestingly previously
reported that the miR-193 is an inducer of the caspase-3
activity, arguing here for its tumor-suppressive functions
[38]. In addition, beyond the fact that the miR-193a5p can probably inhibit multiple target-genes, it seems
clear that its dual role in the apoptotic-processes’ control
could be partially explained by its p73-targeting features.
Obviously, the different functions of the isoforms of p73
are not yet fully elucidated and are undoubtedly modulated
by the interactions of p73 itself with the other members of
the p53 family, especially p63. In return, this gene-family
also regulates the expression of this miRNA, as it was
reported that the oncogenic transcription factor ΔNp63α
is an inducer of the miR-193a-5p’s expression, thus
contributing to the Cisplatin-chemoresistance [23]. These
data could explain a previous study reporting that a stable
p73 knock-down in breast cancer cell lines induce a higher
Cisplatin chemoresistance in the cells which express
ΔNp63 compared with these which do not [36].	
In summary, we present here evidence for an original
epigenetic regulatory mechanism placing the TAp73β/
miRNA-193a-5p axis as a major pathway contributing
to the Cisplatin-sensitivity of the Bone Sarcomas. From
a therapeutic standpoint, our study highlights the proofof-concept that inhibiting the miR-193a-5p expression
consequently sensitizes the Bone Sarcoma cells to
the Cisplatin. Finally, this work sustains the relevant
feasibility of using miRNAs-inhibitors in association with
standard Cisplatin-treatment to improve the response of
the young patients treated with this drug.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor cell lines and therapeutic agents
Seven human Ewing Sarcoma cell lines were used:
the A673 TC32, SKES-1 and RDES cell lines, which were
kindly provided by Dr. S. Burchill (Children’s Hospital,
Leeds, United Kingdom), the EW24 and TC71 cell lines,
which were a gift from Dr. O. Delattre (Institut National de
la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U830, Paris, France)
and the IOR/BRZ one. Seven Osteosarcoma cell lines
were studied: 143B, CAL-72, MNNG/HOS (thereafter
called HOS), SaOS2, SJSA-1, MG63 and U2OS.All these

(ATCC). The JHU-029 cells were a generous gift of
David Sidransky, MD (Johns Hopkins University, USA)
and are used as positive control because of their use in
the previous study of Ory et al. [23]. HEK 293FT cells
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) are
used to produce lentiviral particles. See supplementary
methods for detailed cell culture conditions. The Cisplatin
powder was provided by Sigma and solubilized in 0.9%
NaCl solution and stored at -20oC.

calculated thanks to the GraphPad Prism 6 software.

2D clonogenic assay
Bone Sarcoma cells were seeded at a density of
1000 cells per well in 6-wells plate and treated with 3
µM of Cisplatin or the corresponding amount of NaCl
0.9% for 48 hours. Culture medium was then replaced
by fresh one and the cells were cultured for additional 6
days. The colonies were then washed in PBS, fixed with
glutaraldehyde 10% and stained with Crystal Violet (1%
in water). Pictures were taken and five areas/well were
arbitrary chosen to represent the entire surface of each
well. The stained surfaces/total surfaces of each area/well
were calculated thanks to the ImageJ software.

Lentiviral and retroviral production
P73-shRNA lentiviral particles were produced by
transfection of required viral plasmids (4 μg of each:
RSV-RRE, RGR, VSV-G and 4 μg of TAp73-shRNA;
TAp73si; or 4μg of GFP-shRNA; GFPsi) following the
manufacturer’s protocol (CalPhos Transfection Kit;
Clontech) in HEK 293 FT cell line. The 143B, and the
RDES cells were infected with HEK 293T supernatants
(with GFPsi as a control or TAp73si) and selected by
antibiotic resistance (puromycin, 1μg/mL for the 143B
cells or 0.5 µg/mL for the RDES ones) for several weeks.
P73-shRNA targeted sequence is available upon request.

Apoptotic-cell death assessment
The caspase 3/7 activity was assessed thanks to
the apo-ONE® Homogeneous caspase-3/7 Assay kit
(Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Total RNA extraction and quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR

and anti-

Total RNA was extracted from cultured-cells using
the QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN) and the miRNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA was reversed transcribed using the
ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Life Technologies). Realtime monitoring of PCR amplification was performed on
CFX96 real-time PCR detector system (Bio-Rad, Marnes
la Coquette, France) with SYBR PCR Master Mix buffer
(Bio-Rad). Target gene expression was normalized to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
and β-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels in respective samples
as an internal standard, and the comparative cycle
threshold (Ct) method was used to calculate the relative
amplification of target messenger RNAs. The primers
sequences are described in the Supp. Table 2.

All the pre-miRTM and anti-miRTM were obtained
from Ambion and transfected at a final concentration
of 30 nM using the siPORTNeoFX Transfection Agent
(Ambion) according tothe manufacturer’s protocol.

Transient transfection of TAp73β
The TAp73β sequence was inserted in pcDNA3
vector (Invitrogen). 2μg of DNA were transfected
using FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. These assays
were all performed as described [23].

Cell viability assay and GI50 calculation

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for
miRNAs

Bone Sarcoma cell lines were plated in 96-wells
plates in the appropriate medium with 10% FBS and
treated with Cisplatin at indicated concentration during
48 hours and cell growth was measured using the WST1 assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). At the end of
the treatment time, the culture medium is removed and
replaced by the WST-1 reagent diluted in fresh medium
in a 1:10 proportion. The absorbance at 470 nm was
measured on a 96-multiwell microplate reader (Victor²
1420; PerkinElmer Inc.) and normalized to the average
reading of wells containing medium only. The GI50 were

A specific RT was performed for each miRNA
from 100 ng of total RNA, using specific stemloop RT
primers (50 nM) and the MultiScribe Reverse transcriptase
(Applied Biosystems). The RT conditions were as follows:
30 minutes at 16oC followed by 30 seconds at 20oC, 30
seconds at 42oC, 1 second at 50oC for 60 cycles, and
finally 5 minutes at 85oC. The expression of each gene
was normalized to the one of the small nuclear U6B RNA

Western blotting analysis

7.	

Samples containing equal amounts of protein
(depending on the antibody, 15-80 mg) from lysates
of cultured Bone Sarcoma cell lines underwent
electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and were transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The
membranes were blocked in 3% BSA-PBS-0.05%
Tween at room temperature for 1 hour and blots were
probed overnight at 4oC with the primary antibodies. The
features of the latter are summarized in the Supp. Table
5. Membranes were then saturated 1 hour with 5% milkPBS-0.05% Tween (Régilait) and finally incubated for
1 hour with secondary antibodies at room temperature
(Supp. Table 5). Specific proteins were detected using
SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
(ThermoScientific, Rockford, USA) and a G-Box
(Syngene, Cambridge, UK) after washing. Pictures were
analysed thanks to the ImageJ software.
