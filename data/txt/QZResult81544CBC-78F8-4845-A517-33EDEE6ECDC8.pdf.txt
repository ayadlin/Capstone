ABSTRACT
Arsenic is well established as a human carcinogen, but the molecular mechanisms
leading to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are complex and elusive. It is also not
known if lncRNAs are involved in arsenic-induced liver carcinogenesis. We have
found that MALAT1, a non-coding RNA, is over-expressed in the sera of people
exposed to arsenite and in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and MALAT1  has
a close relation with the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC. In addition,
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α is up-regulated in HCCs, and MALAT1 and HIF-2α
have a positive correlation in HCC tissues. During the malignant transformation of
human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells induced by a low concentration (2.0 μM) of
arsenite, MALAT1 and HIF-2α are increased. In addition, arsenite-induced MALAT1
causes disassociation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein from HIF-2α, therefore,
alleviating VHL- mediated HIF-2α ubiquitination, which causes HIF-2α accumulation.
In turn, HIF- 2α transcriptionally regulates MALAT1, thus forming a positive feedback
loop to ensure expression of arsenite-induced MALAT1 and HIF-2α, which are involved
in malignant transformation. Moreover, MALAT1 and HIF-2α promote the invasive
and metastatic capacities of arsenite-induced transformed L-02 cells and in HCC-LM3
cells. The capacities of MALAT1 and HIF-2α to promote tumor growth are validated in
mouse xenograft models. In mice, arsenite induces an inflammatory response, and
MALAT1 and HIF-2α are over-expressed. Together, these findings suggest that the
MALAT1/HIF-2α feedback loop is involved in regulation of arsenite-induced malignant
transformation. Our results not only confirm a novel mechanism involving reciprocal
regulation between MALAT1 and HIF-2α, but also expand the understanding of the
carcinogenic potential of arsenite.

INTRODUCTION

transformation and induced lncRNAs, which enhanced
accumulation of HIFs. In turn, HIFs regulated transcription
of lncRNAs, providing evidence for the existence of a
feedback loop between HIFs and lncRNA that promotes
arsenite-induced malignant transformation of L-02 cells.
Further, arsenite induced over-expression of HIF-2α and
MALAT1 in animals and enhanced the inflammatory
response. The results provide insight into the mechanisms
of how lncRNAs/HIFs contribute to arsenite-induced
liver carcinogenesis.

Arsenite, an environmental compound with
distinct physical characteristics and toxicity, is a human
carcinogen that is recognized for its importance in public
health [1]. Epidemiological evidence shows that chronic
exposure to inorganic arsenic induces cancers, including
lung, liver, and bladder cancers. It also induces neoplastic
transformation of human cells, and such models have been
used to investigate the mechanisms of arsenite-induced
carcinogenesis. [2–4]. Transcription factors and miRNAs
are involved in arsenite-induced neoplastic transformation
of cells [5], but their mechanisms remain largely
uninvestigated.
Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), HIF-α and
HIF-β, control the expression of hundreds of genes that
function in oncogenic pathways and in the regulation of
proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor metabolism [6]. To
date, investigations have largely focused on the regulation
of protein-coding genes for these pathways [7]. However,
new sequencing technologies are identifying non-coding
transcripts with regulatory roles that are also relevant to
cancer biology [8, 9]. Many of these non-coding genes
are also regulated by hypoxia, and, in particular, long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulated by HIF
transcriptional pathways.
lncRNAs are a new class of RNAs, with lengths
ranging from 200 bp to 100 kbp. Dysregulation of
lncRNAs has been implicated in a variety of human
diseases, including cancer [10]. lncRNAs contribute to
transcriptional regulation by modulating the activity
of transcription factors and by serving as scaffolds
for assembling transcriptional regulators [11].
Post-transcriptional functions for lncRNAs are now
known, with examples of lncRNAs titrating miRNAs and
RNA-binding proteins, modulating mRNA decay and
suppressing target mRNA translation, and functioning as
a platform for protein ubiquitination [12–14].
Three lncRNAs, named HOXA transcript at the
distal tip (HOTTIP) [15], highly upregulated in liver
cancer (HULC), and high expressed in HCC (HEIH),
have functions in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) [16].
Opposite to these tumor promotion functions of lncRNAs,
the lncRNA metallothionein 1D pseudogene (MT1DP)
acts as a tumor suppressor, for its over-expression results
in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft
agar and increased apoptosis in liver cancer cells [17].
Despite studies demonstrating that expression
profiles for HIFs and lncRNAs correlate with tumor
growth, limited information is available regarding
mechanisms by which alterations in lncRNAs and HIFs
contribute to initiation and early progression of arseniteinduced malignancies. In the present study, L-02 cells
in culture and in animal model systems were utilized to
examine lncRNA alterations mediated by arsenite. Chronic
exposure of L-02 cells to arsenite induced malignant

RESULTS
Arsenite exposure is associated with liver and
kidney damage
Blood samples (nonpatient, n = 16; and patient,
n = 16) were examined to measure the extent of exposure
and to assess liver and kidney damage in those exposed
to arsenite (Table 1). Relative to the control group,
urinary and hair arsenite concentrations were higher
(p < 0.01, Table 1). Consistent with the difference of
arsenite exposure, the albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio,
an indicator of liver damage, was lower in the exposed
group relative to the control group (p < 0.01; Table 1). In
addition, the BUN levels, which indicate kidney damage,
of the exposed group were higher than those for the
control group (p < 0.05; Table 1). These results indicate
that arsenite exposure is associated with liver and kidney
damage.

lncRNAs are over-expressed in sera of patients
exposed to arsenite
The expression of lncRNAs in sera of those exposed
and not exposed to arsenite was measured. To assess
candidate lncRNAs for functional studies, we determined
if some common lncRNAs were differentially expressed
in the sera of those exposed to arsenite. H19, HOTAIR,
and MALAT1 were higher in the sera of 16 persons with
long-term exposure to arsenite than in the sera of 16
controls; of the three lncRNAs, the differential expression
of MALAT1 was highest (Figure 1A and 1B). These
results show that some lncRNAs are over-expressed in
sera of people with long-term exposure to arsenite.

In HCC specimens, the levels of MALAT1
are high, and patients with lower levels of
MALAT1 have longer survival times
The expression of MALAT1 is up-regulated in
cancers of the lung, breast, pancreas, liver, colon, uterus,
cervix and prostate [18]. To determine if MALAT1 is
differ­entially expressed in HCC tissues, 32 paired HCC
tissues and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed for
the levels of MALAT1. In HCC specimens, relative

to adjacent normal liver tissues, MALAT1 levels were
up-regulated (Figure 2A). As with most solid tumors, there
is a hypoxic microenvironment in HCCs [19], and HIFs
are involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of
HCCs [20]. As determined in the present experiments,
HIF-2α was over-expressed in 32 paired HCC tissues
compared to adjacent normal liver tissues (Supplementary
Figure S1A and S1B), and there was a positive correlation
between MALAT1 and HIF-2α in HCC tissues
(Supplementary Figure S1C). In addition, the correlations
of MALAT1 expression with clinicopathological
parameters (i.e., maximum diameter, TNM stage) were
used to assess their clinical significance. Tumors > 3 cm
had high MALAT1 expression (Figure 2B), and the levels
of MALAT1 were higher with increasing clinical stage
(Figure 2C). The clinicopathological characteristics of the
patients are listed in Table 2. The levels of MALAT1 in

HCCs were not associated with other parameters, such as
age (p = 0.500) or gender (p = 0.576) (Table 2). These
results indicate that, in HCC specimens, the levels of
MALAT1 are over-expressed and that they correlate with
the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC.
To determine the relationship between MALAT1
levels and the prognosis for HCC patients, the correlation
between MALAT1 expression and overall survival (OS)
was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The OS at
5 years for patients with low MALAT1 expression was
higher than that for those with high MALAT1 expression
(Figure 2D). The longer survival for HCC patients with
lower levels of MALAT1 indicates that MALAT1 is a
prognostic indicator for OS of patients with HCC. The
expression of MALAT1 in five cell lines derived from
liver cancer cells was also examined. MALAT1 levels
in the normal liver L-02 cells were lower than those in

levels of MALAT1 in more aggressive cells; the highest
levels were in the HCC-LM3 cells (Figure 2E). These
data show that the levels of MALAT1 are differentially
expressed in relation to the aggressive characteristics of
liver cancer.

on cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure S2A). Relative
to the control, there was an initial increase in the growth of
cells incubated with 2.0 μM arsenite. Therefore, we chose
2 μM arsenite for use in following experiments. L-02 cells
were exposed to 0.0 or 2.0 μM arsenite for about 15 weeks
(30 passages). The numbers of transformed cells increased
relative to control cells (Supplementary Figure S2B).
To determine if cells chronically exposed to arsenite
had acquired anchorage-independent growth capacity,
their capacity for such growth was evaluated. In agar,
colonies were formed by L-02 cells exposed to 2.0 μM
arsenite, and colonies were formed by the carcinogenic
SMMC-7721 cells. In contrast, control cells showed no
anchorage-independent growth (Figure 3A and 3B). In
addition, tumor incidences in the groups of mice injected
with arsenite-transformed L-02 cells and SMMC-7721
carcinoma cells were 100% (6/6 per group); for the control
group, the incidence was 0% (0/6). The tumor volumes for
the groups implanted with arsenite-transformed cells and
SMMC-7721 cells were larger. (Figure 3C and 3D).

In L-02 cells, arsenite-induced neoplastic
transformation has effects on the levels of
lncRNAs and HIF-2α
To investigate the effects of arsenite on cell
proliferation and cell transformation, L-02 cells were
exposed to 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, or 20.0 μM arsenite for 24,
48, or 72 h. Relative cell proliferation was increased in
cells incubated with 1.0 and 2.0 μM arsenite at 24 h but
was decreased by 10.0 and 20.0 μM arsenite at 48 h and
72 h. There were no appreciable effects of 5.0 μM arsenite

The expressions of various lncRNAs in L-02 cells
exposed to 0.0 or 2.0  μM arsenite for 0, 10, 20, or 30
passages were assessed. MALAT1, H19, and HOTAIR
were increased in arsenite-transformed L-02 cells, and
their expressions increased with increased numbers of
passages (Figure 3E). Similar to our previous results
showing that expression of HIF-2α is induced in human
bronchial epithelial cells exposed to arsenite [4], we
demonstrated that HIF-2α is up-regulated in HCC tissues.
We also determined that HIF-2α expression in L-02
cells increases with increased numbers of passages in
the presence of arsenite (Figure 3F). The expressions of
MALAT1, H19, and HOTAIR increased after arsenite
exposure over periods ranging from 0 to 24 h (Figure 3G).
Over 24 h, the levels of HIF-2α were also increased by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arsenite (Figure 3H). Furthermore, HIF-2α was expressed
in L-02 cells exposed for 12 h to DFX, an iron chelator
used to mimic hypoxia [21] (Figure 3H). Thus, a low level
of arsenite induces malignant transformation of L-02 cells
and up-regulates MALAT1 and HIF-2α.

Effect of MALAT1 on the degradation of HIF-2α
in L-02 cells exposed to arsenite
We next determined if MALAT1 mediates HIF- 2α
expression. After transfection of L-02 cells exposed
to arsenite for 24  h with MALAT1-specific siRNA1,
siRNA2, or siRNA3, levels of MALAT1 mRNA
decreased (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Of
these, siRNA3 was more efficient, and it was applied in
5773

further experiments. In L-02 cells exposed to arsenite,
HIF-2α mRNA levels were not affected, however, there
was a decrease of HIF-2α protein expression and of HIF2α gene targets; mRNA levels of VEGF and Oct4 were
decreased by knockdown of MALAT1 (Figure 4A).
These results indicate that HIF-2α accumulation mediated
by MALAT1 upon arsenite exposure occurs at the
posttranscriptional level. Then, we found that arsenite
could stable HIF-2α protein in the cellular (Supplementary
Figure S3C and S3D). Next, in the arsenite-treated cells
transfected with control siRNA, the levels of HIF-2α
protein decreased slowly. In contrast, in the MALAT1transfected cells, the HIF-2α protein had a shorter half-life
and was barely detectable at 30 min (Figure 4B and 4C).
To determine if the faster reduction of HIF-2α
protein in MALAT1-inhibited cells was associated with
its proteasome-dependent degradation. The reduction of
HIF-2α caused by MALAT1 knockdown was reversed by
MG132 (Figure 4D). Since hydroxylation of the HIF-2α
protein at proline residue 531 is required for VHL binding
and subsequent degradation through the ubiquitinproteasome pathway [22], the effect of MALAT1 on hyp531
HIF-2α levels was determined. MALAT1 knockdown led to

an increase in hyp531 HIF-2α levels in L-02 cells exposed
to arsenite (Figure 4E). Further, knockdown of MALAT1
attenuated arsenite-reduced HIF- 2α polyubiqutination
(Figure 4F). Moreover, knockdown of MALAT1 enhanced
the HIF-2α-VHL interaction in L-02 cells exposed to
arsenite (Figure 4G). Together, these results indicate that
arsenite-induced MALAT1 causes disassociation of VHL
from HIF-2α, thereby alleviating VHL-mediated HIF-2α
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.

MALAT1 is a transcriptional target of HIF-2α in
L-02 cells exposed to arsenite
In endothelial cells, hypoxia increases MALAT1,
which controls a phenotypic switch [23]. We hypothesized
that MALAT1 is regulated by HIF-2α. To establish this,
HIF-2α was knocked down in L-02 cells exposed to arsenite.
In these cells, knockdown of HIF-2α attenuated arseniteinduced MALAT1 up-regulation (Figure 5A). Conversely,
ectopic expression of HIF-2α increased MALAT1
expression equivalent to arsenite-induced MALAT1
upregulation (Figure 5B). These data indicate that HIF-2α
is responsible for arsenite-induced MALAT1 expression.

We next determined if HIF-2α regulates MALAT1
expression at the transcriptional level. The genomic
sequence upstream of the gene coding for MALAT1 was
inspected by use of the Genomatix suite of sequence
analysis tools (MatInspector). Three putative hypoxia
response elements (HREs, 5′-RCGTG-3′) were found
within the promoter of the MALAT1 gene (Figure 5C).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
used to determine the association of HIF-2α and the
chromatin fragments corresponding to the three HREs
within the MALAT1 gene. For L-02 cells exposed to
arsenite, the antibody against HIF-2α immunoprecipitated
DNA fragments containing the potential binding site,
which was the third HRE, not the first and the second
HREs in the promoter regions of MALAT1 (Figure 5D).
We also confirmed an interaction of HIF-2α with the
third HRE of MALAT1 promoter regions in HCC-LM3
cells (Supplementary Figure S4A). In addition, we
evaluated whether the HREs within the MALAT1 gene
confer HIF-2α-dependent transcriptional activity. Since
the first and second HREs were close, one reporter
plasmid containing the two HREs was constructed and
designated as MALAT1-P1; the other one was designated
as MALAT1-P2. DNA fragments containing wildtype or mutant HREs were inserted into the promoter

region of a luciferase reporter plasmid. The result was
that luciferase expression from MALAT1-P2, but not
from the MALAT1-P1 reporter or the mutant reporter,
was decreased by inhibiting expression of HIF-2α
(Figure 5E and 5F). In contrast, luciferase expression from
MALAT1-P2, but not the MALAT1-P1 reporter or the
mutant reporter, was induced by arsenite and by ectopic
expression of HIF-2α (Figure 5G and 5H). These results
demonstrate that MALAT1 is transcriptionally upregulated
by HIF-2α in L-02 cells exposed to arsenite.

MALAT1 and HIF-2α are involved in the
arsenite-induced malignant transformation of
L-02 cells
Since MALAT1 and HIF-2α are over-expressed in
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells (Figure 3), the functions of
MALAT1 and HIF-2α during arsenite-induced malignant
transformation, an early step in liver carcinogenesis,
were examined. Arsenite-transformed L-02 cells were
transduced with lentivirus-mediated sh-MALAT1 or
sh-RNA negative control (shRNA-NC) vectors. The
transduced cells were detected as green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-positive cells following the addition of GFP
together with the MALAT1 shRNAs. The expression of

the lentivirus-mediated MALAT1 shRNAs was confirmed
by fluorescence imaging (Figure  6A). The level of
MALAT1 detected by qRT–PCR was reduced following
transduction by MALAT1 shRNAs compared with that
in the arsenite-transformed L-02 cells and shRNA-NCtransduced cells (Figure  6B). These findings confirmed
that the lentivirus-mediated transduction of the MALAT1
shRNAs were effective. Incubated under anchorageindependent conditions, the T-L02-sh-NC cells produced
an elevated number of large colonies, but cells silenced
for MALAT1 formed only a few colonies, and these were
of small size (Figure 6C, upper, and 6D). To determine if
MALAT1 facilitates migration and invasion of arsenitetransformed L-02 cells, invasion through Matrigel and
migration through Transwells were evaluated. Relative to
controls, inhibition of MALAT1 impeded the invasion and
migration of arsenite-transformed L-02 cells (Figure 6C,

and metastatic capacity were confirmed in HCC-LM3
cells, which were also transfected with lentivirus
sh-MALAT1 (Supplementary Figure S5A, S5B, S5C,
S5D, and S5E). Moreover, MALAT1-knockdown cells
were injected into nude mice. MALAT1 knockdown
decreased the sizes of tumors that developed relative to
the arsenite-treated group (Figure 6F and 6G). MALAT1
knockdown, however, did not change the incidence rate.
In addition, the lentivirus-negative vector (sh-NC) and shHIF-2α were transfected into arsenite-transformed L-02
cells. At post-transfection, fluorescent microscopy showed
emission of green fluorescence (Figure  6H). qRT-PCR
showed that expression of HIF-2α level was decreased
in sh- HIF-2α-transfected, arsenite-transformed L-02
cells (T-L-02-sh-HIF-2α cells), compared to control cells
(Figure  6I). Silencing of HIF-2α reduced the formation

arsenite-transformed cells (Figure 6J, 6K and 6L). The role
of HIF-2α in the malignant and metastatic capacity was
confirmed in HCC-LM3 cells, which were also transfected
with sh-HIF-2α (Supplementary Figure S5F, S5G, S5H,

bladder [26]. Various molecular mechanisms have been
proposed for arsenite-induced carcinogenesis [27], but the
function of lncRNAs in arsenite-induced cancer has not
previously been evaluated.
As early as 1976, villagers from Guizhou province
in southwestern China were reported to be suffering severe
symptoms of arsenicosis, which was attributed to exposure
to high levels of arsenic in food, especially in corn and
chili peppers, and to a lesser extent by breathing arsenicladen air [28]. miRNAs can be used as biomarkers of
disease as well as for arsenic exposure, and can account
for disease etiology [29]. Nevertheless, whether or not
lncRNAs are involved in arsenite carcinogenesis has
remained unknown. The levels of the lncRNA HOTAIR
are increased in primary breast tumors and metastases,
and its level in primary tumors is a predictor of metastasis
and death [15]. MALAT1 is an lncRNA associated with
metastasis and survival in early-stage non-small cell
lung tumors (NSCLCs) [30]. In some prostate and breast
cancer cell lines, expression of GAS5 induces growth
arrest and apoptosis independent of other stimuli [31].
After genotoxic stress, lincRNA-p21 is up-regulated in
breast cancer cells [32], indicating that it is associated
with survival of these cells. Based on their functions,
lncRNAs can be classified into oncogene and tumorsuppressor types [33]. In the present study, we collected
32 villagers sera in December 2013, and determined the
expression of some common lncRNAs. In those arsenite
exposure samples, the arsenite concentrations in urine and
hair were higher than those not exposed, and those who
were exposed had kidney and liver damage. We also found
that, of lncRNAs with elevated expression, MALAT1 had
the highest expression. These data indicate that lncRNAs
may serve as serum biomarker for diagnosing exposure
to arsenite.
lncRNAs are defined as non-coding RNA transcripts
longer than 200 nt. Thus far, more than 10, 000 lncRNAs
have been identified in the human genome [34]. MALAT1
is an lncRNA originally found to be over-expressed
in patients at high risk for metastasis of NSCLCs [30].
MALAT1 is up-regulated in human lung cancers, breast
cancers, pancreatic cancers, colon cancers, prostate
cancers, and endometrial stromal sarcomas [30, 35]. For
several cancers, MALAT1 expression is an independent
prognostic parameter for survival [18]. Initially, we
determined MALAT1 expression in HCC cell lines, HCC
tissues, and in paired adjacent normal tissues and found
that its expression was higher in HCC cell lines and HCC
tissues. We also found that HIF-2α was over-expressed in
32 paired HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver
tissues. For HCC patients, high MALAT1 expression
was associated with greater tumor size, higher stage, and
shorter OS. These results suggest that MALAT1 functions
as an oncogene in liver cancer.
Chronic exposure to low levels of arsenite (< 5 μM)
causes cell proliferation, which can lead to neoplastic

Arsenite-induced inflammatory response and
effects on the levels of HIF-2α and MALAT1 in
mice
The expressions of MALAT1 and HIF-2α
were evaluated in mice. Four groups of CD1 mice
were untreated or treated with low, middle, or high
concentrations (50 μM, 100 μM, and 200 μM, respectively)
of arsenite, which were added to the drinking water daily
for three months. There were no appreciable differences
in body weights of the four groups (Supplementary
Table 2). However, the expression of MALAT1 in sera
and liver tissues of mice exposed to arsenite was increased
(Figure 7A and 7B, respectively), as were HIF-2α levels
in liver tissues of these mice (Figure 7C and 7D). Our
previous study showed that chronic exposure of cultured
HBE cells to arsenite induces an inflammatory response
associated with HIF-2α, which contributes to arseniteinduced malignant transformation [24]. Although we
failed to detect tumors in mice exposed to arsenite, we
found that the numbers of macrophages, lymphocytes, and
neutrophils in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of
the arsenite-treated group were higher than those for the
control group (Figure 7E and Table 3). Further, release of
the pro-inflammatory IL-6 cytokine into the BALF and
serum increased (Figure 7F, top and bottom, respectively).
The mRNA levels and release of other pro-inflammatory
cytokines (TNF-α and IL-8) from liver tissue, serum,
and BALF increased, but there was no change for IL-1β
(Supplementary Figure S6A, S6B, S6C and S6D). These
results indicate that arsenite induces inflammation in
mice. The expression of IL-6 positively correlated with
the levels of HIF-2α in liver tissues (Figure 7G). Further,
there was a positive correlation between MALAT1 and
IL-6 levels (Figure 7H). Thus, arsenite induces overexpression of HIF-2α and MALAT1 in mice and may
cause an elevated inflammatory response.

DISCUSSION
Inorganic arsenite is a widely distributed, naturally
occurring environmental contaminant affecting tens of
millions of people worldwide [25]. Chronic exposure to
arsenite causes carcinogenesis of lung, skin, liver, and

transformation, whereas high levels cause cytotoxicity,
indicating that the effects of arsenite are dependent on the
degree of exposure [3, 36]. In the United States and China,
the current maximum contaminant level for arsenite
in drinking water is 10  μg/L (~ 0.5  μM) [37]. In this
study, 1.0 and 2.0 μM concentrations of arsenite, lower
than levels in drinking water in areas where arsenicosis
is common, did not cause cell death [38]. Since the
cell proliferation rate induced by 2.0  μM arsenite was
higher than that induced by 1.0  μM arsenite, we used
2.0 μM arsenite for long-term exposures. This low level
of arsenite enhanced neoplastic transformation of cells,
as determined by anchorage-independent growth in soft
agar and tumorigenesis in nude mice. In addition, with

increased time of exposure to arsenite, there were more
malignant cells and elevated expression of MALAT1.
Based on these data, we suggest that MALAT1 may be
involved in the neoplastic transformation of L-02 cells
induced by arsenite.
Under normoxia, the HIF-α protein is maintained at
low levels due to continuous synthesis and degradation, but
levels increase rapidly in response to hypoxia [39]. HIF-α
is not only induced by hypoxia, but is activated in normoxic
cells in response to various stresses [40]. For example,
exposure of normoxic cells to peptide mediators, including
insulin and IL-1, stabilizes the HIF-1α protein [41],
which is involved in nickel-induced malignant
transformation of cells under normoxic conditions [42].

Under normoxic conditions, arsenite and some other
metals directly (catalytically) or indirectly induce the
stabilization and transactivation of HIF-1α [5]. The
present studies show elevated expression of HIF-2α in
normoxic cells with increased time of exposure to arsenite.
Thus, these data indicate that HIF-2α may be involved in
the neoplastic transformation of L-02 cells induced by
arsenite.
Although mammalian lncRNAs are best known for
modulating transcription, they have a post-transcriptional
influence on mRNA splicing, stability, and translation [43].
An example is that HOTAIR facilitates the ubiquitination
of ataxin-1 by Dzip3 and snurportin-1 by mex3b in
cells and accelerates their degradation [14]. Moreover,
lincRNA-p21 causes disassociation of VHL from
HIF-1α, thereby alleviating VHL-mediated HIF-1a
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [13]. Under
hypoxic conditions, HIFs accumulate in a posttranslational
manner. Under normoxic conditions, the capacity of
HIFs to activate transcription is prevented through its
hydroxylation. Hydroxylated HIFs recruit the VHL
tumor suppressor, leading to the recognition by E3
ubiquitin ligase and subsequent ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation [44]. The arseniteinduced accumulation of HIF apparently relates to
posttranscriptional regulation [5].
Since, in the present research, both MALAT1
and HIF-2α were induced by arsenite in L-02 cells, we
speculated that MALAT1 regulates HIF-2α degradation
through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent
with this hypothesis, HIF-2α mRNA levels were not
affected by knockdown of MALAT1, but there was
a decrease of HIF-2α protein in L-02 cells exposed
to arsenite, moreover, mRNA levels of HIF-2α target
genes, VEGF and Oct4, were decreased. The HIF-2α
reduction caused by MALAT1 knockdown was rescued
by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Moreover, reduced
degradation of hyp531 HIF-2α enhanced the HIF-2α-VHL
interaction and increased HIF-2α polyubiqutination. Thus,
arsenite-induced MALAT1 causes disassociation of VHL
from HIF-2α and thereby alleviates VHL-mediated HIF-2α
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
Similar to human lincRNA-p21, which is induced by
hypoxia, other lncRNAs, including H19 and lncRNA-low
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression in tumor (LET), are regulated by hypoxia and
are involved in hypoxia-induced signaling transduction in
cancer [45, 46]. These observations, together with ours,
suggest that lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of
hypoxia-induced signaling induced by arsenite. HIFs
transcriptionally regulate expression of a variety of
genes by binding to HREs in their promoters [47]. In
the present study, analysis of the gene promoter region
(MatInspector) allowed us to predict that there are three
putative HREs (5′-RCGTG-3′) in gene promoter region
of the MALAT1 gene, suggesting that HIF-2α regulates
MALAT1 expression via binding to HREs. We determined
the association of HIF-2α and the chromatin fragments
corresponding to the third HRE within the MALAT1
gene in L-02 cells exposed to arsenite and in HCC-LM3
cells. Further, inhibition of HIF-2α decreased expression
of MALAT1, and HIF-2α upregulated MALAT1-HRE3
transcriptional activity. These results indicate that
MALAT1 is transcriptionally up-regulated by HIF-2α in
L-02 cells exposed to arsenite.
MALAT1 was originally identified as an lncRNA,
showing high expression in individuals at high risk for
metastasis of non-small cell lung tumors [6]. Its expression
is upregulated in a range of tumors, including lung cancer,
liver cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and
osteosarcoma [48]. HIF-2α is involved in tumor cell
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion and in the
metastatic spread of tumor cells [47]. Our studies focused
on the effects of MALAT1 and HIF-2α on the neoplastic
and invasive capacity of cells after long-term exposure to
arsenite. Knockdown of MALAT1 with lentivirus shRNA
inhibited the neoplastic and invasive capacity of arsenitetransformed L-02 cells and HCC-LM3 cells. The roles of
HIF-2α in solid tumors have been assessed [47]. We also
found that knockdown of HIF-2α with lentivirus shRNA
inhibited the neoplastic and invasive capacity of arsenitetransformed L-02 cells and HCC-LM3 cells. These results
indicate that MALAT1 and HIF-2α are involved in the
neoplastic and metastatic capacity of arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells and HCC-LM3 cells.
Finally, we determined that MALAT1 and HIF-2α
were up-regulated in mice exposed to arsenite for three
months. MALAT1 was over-expressed in mouse serum
and liver tissues, and HIF-2α levels were elevated in liver

tissues of these mice. Low-dose arsenic exposures (5–250 
ppb in drinking water, or nM to low μM concentrations)
increased neovascularization of chicken chorioallantoic
membranes, stimulated inflammatory angiogenesis in
a mouse Matrigel assay, and increased vascular density
and vessel size in mouse tumors [49]. Our previous study
showed that chronic arsenite exposure of cultured HBE
cells induces an inflammatory response, which contributes
to arsenite-induced malignant transformation [24]. We
have shown that arsenite induces inflammation in mice,
but does not cause tumors. Michael P. Waalkes research
team confirmed that lung, liver, gallbladder, and ovarian
tumors could be induced by “whole‑life” inorganic arsenic
exposure in CD1 mice at human‑relevant doses [50, 51].
Although short time exposure to arsenic did not induce
tumors, our results could provide a hint that MALAT1
and HIF-2α over-expression were involved in arsenite
carcinogenesis. In the future, we plan to implement
whole-life exposure of mice to arsenite and determine the
relationship between arsenite carcinogenesis and HIF-2α
and MALAT1. In addition, the expression of IL-6 positively
correlated with the levels of HIF-2α in liver tissues of mice.
Further, there was a positive correlation between MALAT1
and IL-6 in liver tissues of mice. These data indicate that
arsenite induces HIF-2α and MALAT1 over-expression in
animals and induces an inflammatory response.
In summary, we have shown that MALAT1, a noncoding RNA, was over-expressed in the sera of people
exposed to arsenite and in hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCCs), and MALAT1 had a close relation with the
clinicopathological characteristics of HCC. In addition,
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α was up-regulated
in HCCs, and MALAT1 and HIF-2α had a positive
correlation in HCC tissues. In addition, in arsenite-induced
neoplastic transforma­tion of L-02 cells, over-expression
of MALAT1 increased HIF-2α expression through
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In turn, HIF-2α
transcriptionally regulated MALAT1, thus forming
a positive feedback loop to ensure arsenite-induced
MALAT1 and HIF-2α expression, which were involved
in malignant transformation and carcinogenesis. We also
found that, in mice, arsenite induced an inflammatory
response and over-expression of MALAT1 and HIF-2α.
Together, these findings suggest that the MALAT1/
HIF-2α feedback loop was involved in regulation of
arsenite-induced malignant transformation. Our results
not only confirm a novel mechanism involving reciprocal
regulation of MALAT1 and HIF-2α and also expand the
understand­ing of the carcinogenic potential of arsenite.

identify populations exposed to arsenite [52]. In
December 2013, our team collected samples from the
target population, with a total of 32 villagers agreeing to
participate in the study. Their participation was approved
by our institutional review board. Informed consent
could not be offered, because the data were analyzed
anonymously. Arsenicosis symptoms were categorized
based on the degree of symptoms: nonpatient (n = 16)
and severe patient (n = 16). Symptoms were classified
according to the Chinese National Arsenicosis Diagnosis
Standard protocol [52]. Patients (n = 16), defined as
individuals showing symptoms of arsenicosis, from
Jiaole, Guizhou province, were designated the arsenite
exposure group. The other 16 villagers, from near Jiaole
who were not exposed to arsenite and had no symptoms
of arsenicosis, were as designated the control group
(Table 1).

Patients and tissue samples
A total of 32 Chinese HCC patients were
involved. Consent was obtained for all patients. These
patients underwent curative liver resection for primary
tumors between March 2009 and July 2012 in the
Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated
Hospital, Nanjing Medical University. The inclusion
criteria for the patient cohort included (i) having a
distinctive pathological diagnosis of HCC; (ii) surgical
resection, defined as complete resection of all tumor
nodules with the cut margin being free of cancer by
histological examination; and (iii) having complete
clinicopathological data. An exclusion criterion was
having anticancer treatment before liver resection.
None of the patients had extrahepatic metastases when
they underwent hepatectomy. The clinicopathological
characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 2. This
study was reviewed and approved by Medical Ethics
Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing
Medical University.

Animals
Mice (CD1) were purchased from Shanghai
Laboratory Animal Center, Shanghai, China), and housed
in the animal facilities at the Jiangsu Center for Disease
Control and Prevention. Animals were treated humanely
and with regard for alleviation of suffering according to
a protocol approved by the Jiangsu Center for Disease
Control and Prevention Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Briefly, 64  male CD1  mice aged 7–8
weeks were randomly divided into four groups (16 mice
per group). One group was reserved as the non-treated
control group. The other three groups were treated with
low, middle, and high concentrations of arsenite (50 μM,
100 μM, and 200 μM, respectively), which was added to
the drinking water daily for three months.

the products on 2% w/v agarose gels. Bands were
quantified by densitometry and normalized by the use of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or
18s ribosomal RNA to correct for differences in loading.
For densitometric analyses, the mRNA bands on the gels
were measured by Eagle Eye II.

L-02 cells, a normal human liver cell line, and HCC
cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721, Bel-7402, MHCC97H,
and HCC-LM3) were obtained from the Shanghai Institute
of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China) and were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C in RPMI1640 or DMEM medium, respectively, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies/Gibco,
Grand Island, NY), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100  μg/ml
streptomycin (Life Technologies/Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD).
For chronic exposure, 1 × 106 L-02 cells were seeded
into 10-cm (diameter) dishes for 24 h and maintained
in 0.0 or 2.0  μM sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO; purity, 99.0%) for 48–72 h per passage. This
process was continued for about 15 weeks (30 passages);
desferroxamine (DFX), an iron chelator routinely used
to mimic hypoxia, was purchased from Sigma. The
proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and the protein synthesis
inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), were purchased from
Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents were
of analytical grade or the highest grade available.

the primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. qRT-PCR was
performed with an Applied Biosystems 7300HT machine
and MaximaTM SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix
(Fermentas). Fold changes in expression of each gene were
calculated by a comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method
using the formula 2−(ΔΔCt). And the absolute expression in
each subject was calculated with a standard curve, and
the mean value of the control group was determined. The
relative values between each sample and the mean values
were calculated.

Serum RNA extraction
Blood samples were centrifuged at 15000g to
separate the sera. All of the samples were collected and
stored at −70°C and thawed immediately before assay.
Total RNA was isolated from serum using TRIzol LS
reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK)
according to manufacturer’s instructions with the
following modifications: In brief, each 250  μl serum
sample was mixed with 750  μl TRIzol LS Reagent.
After 5  min incubation at room temperature, 200  μl of
chloroform was added, followed by 15 sec of shaking
and 10 min of incubation at room temperature. The
mixture was centrifuged at 12, 000g for 15 min at 4°C
in a concentrator (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, Hamburg,
Germany). The aqueous layer containing RNA was
transferred into a new tube, then RNA was precipitated for
16 hr at −20°C with 0.5 ml isopropyl alcohol and washed
with 1 ml of 75% ethanol. Finally, the RNA pellet was
dried for 5–10 min at room temperature, dissolved at 60°C
in 15 μl of RNase-free water. The RNA concentration was
measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The final concentrations of RNA ranged
from 319~782 ng/μl. The TRIzol method is described in
other studies [53, 54].

Western blots
Total cell lysates were prepared with a detergent
buffer, as described [55]. Protein concentrations were
measured with the BCA Protein Assay according to
the manufacturer’s manual (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Equal amounts (80 μg)
of protein were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica,
MA). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with a
1:1000 dilution of anti-GAPDH (Sigma) and antibodies
for HIF-2α (Abcam), VHL protein (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA), and ubiquitin (Novus,
Littleton, CO). After additional incubation with a 1:1000
dilution of an anti-immunoglobin horseradish peroxidaselinked antibody for 1 h, the immune complexes were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling
Technology). For densitometric analyses, protein bands
on the blots were measured by the use of Eagle Eye II
software.

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total cellular and tissue RNA was isolated by use
of TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Total RNA (2 μg) was transcribed into
cDNA by the use of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega,

Determination of cell proliferation

(BALF), ELISA tests were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A human-specific interleukin
(IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α ELISA from Beijing 4A
Biotech Co., Ltd (Beijing) was used to determine the
amounts of inflammatory cytokines. All assays were
performed in duplicate and repeated three times.

Cell proliferation was evaluated by WST- 
8
(a tetrazolium salt that is cleaved to formazan)
hydrolysis using cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular
Technologies, Inc.), as described previously [56]. Briefly,
cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at 4000
cells per well. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with
5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After the cells were
treated and incubated, 20 μL of WST-8 was added to each
well, and the incubation was continued for an additional
3 h. Samples from at least three independent experiments
were analyzed in duplicate. The relative cell proliferation
ratios were plotted with non-treated controls to determine
the 100% activity level.

Anchorage-independent growth
Soft-agar dishes were prepared with under-layers
of 0.70% agarose in RPMI-1640 or DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% FBS. To test their capacity for
soft-agar growth, cells were plated in triplicate at a density
of 1 × 104 in 2 ml of 0.35% agarose. Cultures were fed
every 3 days. After 14 days, the colonies were observed
under a microscope, and colonies with diameters > 80 μm
were counted. These represent colonies with > 30 cells.

Growth kinetics
Control and arsenite-treated L-02 cells were seeded
in 6-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 per well. The
plates were incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 24, 48, or
72 h, then collected by trypsinization. Cells were counted
in triplicate using a hemocytometer under a microscope.
The population doubling time was obtained by the
formula: TD = T × log2/(logNt - logN0), where Nt is the
inoculum cell number, N0 is the cell harvest number, and t
is the time of the culture (in h) [4].

Co-immunoprecipitation

RNA interference

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Transfections of L-02 cells were performed with
the N-TER™ and AccuTarget TMN nanoparticle siRNA
Transfection System (Sigma, BIONEER) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were
seeded into each well of 6-well plates, 18–24 h prior to
transfection. The siRNA nanoparticle preparations were
made by adding target gene siRNA dilutions to N-TER or
AccuTarget peptide dilutions. Control siRNA and HIF-2α
siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Control siRNA and MALAT1 siRNA
were purchased from BIONEER.

The plasmid of HIF-2α was a gift from Dr. Rui Chen
(Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, USA). Cells were
transiently transfected by use of the Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h after transfection, cells
were treated, harvested, and used for experiments.

ChIP was performed as previously described [57].
Cells (1 × 107) were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for
10 min. After cell lysis, the chromatin was fragmented to
an average size of 500 bp and enriched with a magnetic
Dynal bead (Invitrogen)-coupled antibody against
HIF-2α or with isotype IgG at 4°C overnight. The
cross-links for the enriched and the input DNA were
then reversed, and the DNA was cleaned by RNase A
(0.2 mg/mL) and proteinase K (2 mg/mL) before phenol/
chloroform purification. The specific sequences from
immunoprecipitated and input DNA were determined by
PCR primers for MALAT1 promoter upstream regions:
MALAT1 promoter (containing HRE1) forward, 5′-TGA
GGCTGGAGTGCAGTGGC -3′, and reverse, 5′-AGGGA
GGCGGAGGTTACGGT -3′, the amplicon size was 55 bp;
MALAT1 promoter (containing HRE2) forward, 5′-GGAG
ATTTTGTGATTTGC -3′, and reverse, 5′-TGACAGAA
GTGCTGGAGA -3′, the amplicon size was 114 bp; MA
LAT1 promoter (containing HRE3) forward, 5′-CCCTAA
CGCCTGTGCCTGTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGCAGAG
TAGCGACCGAGAA-3′; the amplicon size was 83 bp.

ELISA assays

Transwell assays

To determine the amounts of inflammatory cytokines
in CD1  mouse serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

Migratory and invasive capacities of arsenitetreated L-02 cells and HCC-LM3 cells were evaluated

Cells were extracted for 30 min with lysis buffer.
After centrifugation of the preparations, the supernatants
were incubated with HIF-2α antibody and subsequently
with A+G Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4°C overnight.
The pellets were washed three times, re-suspended in
SDS sample buffer, and boiled to remove protein from the
beads. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western
blots with anti-ubiquitin, HIF-2α, and VHL antibodies.

secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min. The
sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, cleared, and mounted.

Luciferase activity assay

Statistical analyses

The pGL3-MALAT1-P1-Luc construct, the pGL3MALAT1-P2-Luc construct, and the mut-Luc construct
were purchased from Genechem (Shanghai, China). The
plasmid phRL-tk (used as internal control for transfection
efficiency and cytotoxicity of test chemicals) containing
the Renilla luciferase gene was purchased from Promega
(Madison, WI, USA). The cells proliferated to 60 – 80%
confluence after 24  h of culture. Then, the cells were
co-transfected with 2 μg of DNA of the reporter constructs
and HIF-2α plasmid or HIF-2α siRNA using the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The amounts of
luciferase and Renilla luciferase were measured with the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System Kit (Promega)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The values of
luciferase activity for each lysate were normalized to the
Renilla luciferase activity. The relative transcriptional
activity was converted into fold induction above the
vehicle control value.

Derived values are presented as the means ± SD.
Comparison of mean data among multiple groups was
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
a multiple range least significant difference (LSD) was
used for inter-group comparisons. P values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS 16.0.

Lentiviral vector transfection
For knockdown of MALAT1 or HIF-2α expression,
lentivirus particles carrying shRNA specifically targeting
MALAT1 or HIF-2α were purchased from GeneChem
(Shanghai, China). For cell infection, 60% confluent
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells or HCC-LM3 cells were
incubated with 50 or 30 MOI of lentivirus, respectively,
and 5  μg/ml of polybrene. After 24  h of transfection,
the transfection medium was replaced with medium
containing puromycin (5  μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for at
least 2 weeks before usage to select stable cell pools.
Successful transduction was determined by counting the
green fluorescence emitted from GFP-stained lentiviral
particles under a fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL,
Advanced Microscopy Group, Mill Creek, Washington).
Cells infected with lentivirus with empty vector (sh-NC)
were used as controls.
