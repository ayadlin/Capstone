Abstract
Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist administered to breast cancer patients by monthly intramuscular
injection. Given its present limitations of dosing and route
of administration, a more ﬂexible orally available compound
has been sought to pursue the potential beneﬁts of this drug
in patients with advanced metastatic disease. Here we report
the identiﬁcation and characterization of AZD9496, a nonsteroidal small-molecule inhibitor of ERa, which is a potent
and selective antagonist and downregulator of ERa in vitro and
in vivo in ER-positive models of breast cancer. Signiﬁcant
tumor growth inhibition was observed as low as 0.5 mg/kg
dose in the estrogen-dependent MCF-7 xenograft model, where
this effect was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in
PR protein levels, demonstrating potent antagonist activity.

Combining AZD9496 with PI3K pathway and CDK4/6 inhibitors led to further growth-inhibitory effects compared with
monotherapy alone. Tumor regressions were also seen in a
long-term estrogen-deprived breast model, where signiﬁcant
downregulation of ERa protein was observed. AZD9496
bound and downregulated clinically relevant ESR1 mutants
in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in an ESR1-mutant
patient-derived xenograft model that included a D538G
mutation. Collectively, the pharmacologic evidence showed
that AZD9496 is an oral, nonsteroidal, selective estrogen
receptor antagonist and downregulator in ERþ breast cells
that could provide meaningful beneﬁt to ERþ breast cancer
patients. AZD9496 is currently being evaluated in a phase I
clinical trial. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3307–18. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

tors have been implicated in driving resistance in cells, for example, receptor tyrosine kinases (HER2), EGFR, and their downstream signaling pathways, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/protein
kinase B (AKT) signaling (3–5). In some instances, signaling from
different growth factor receptor kinases leads to phosphorylation
of various proteins in the ER pathway, including ER itself, leading
to ligand-independent activation of the ER pathway (6).
In the metastatic setting, 500 mg fulvestrant, given as 2  250
mg intramuscular injections, has been shown to offer additional
beneﬁt over the 250 mg dose with improved median overall
survival (7, 8). Recent analysis of presurgical data from a number
of trials showed a dose-dependent effect on key biomarkers such
as ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and Ki67 labeling index (9).
Although fulvestrant is clearly effective in this later treatment
setting, there are still perceived limitations in its overall clinical
beneﬁt due to very low bioavailability, the time taken to achieve
plasma steady-state of 3–6 months and ultimately the level of ERa
reduction seen in clinical samples (10, 11). It is widely believed
that a potent, orally bioavailable SERD that could achieve higher
steady-state free drug levels more rapidly would have the potential
for increased receptor knockdown and lead to quicker clinical
responses, reducing the possibility of early relapses (12). Moreover, the recent discovery of ESR1 mutations in metastatic breast
cancer patients that had received prior endocrine treatments,
where the mutated receptor is active in the absence of estrogen,

With over 70% of breast cancers expressing the estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), treatment with antihormonal therapies that
directly antagonize ER function (e.g., tamoxifen) or therapies
that block the production of the ligand, estrogen (e.g., aromatase
inhibitors) are key to management of the disease both in adjuvant
and metastatic settings (1, 2). Despite initial efﬁcacy seen with
endocrine therapies, the development of acquired resistance
ultimately limits the use of these agents although the majority
of tumors continue to require ERa for growth. Through the use of
preclinical models and cell lines, changes in growth factor recep-

highlights an important potential resistance mechanism. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have shown a reduction in signaling
from ESR1 mutants by tamoxifen and fulvestrant, but at higher
doses than required to inhibit the wild-type receptor, which
implies that more potent SERDs may be required to treat these
patients or to use in the adjuvant setting to limit the emergence of
mutations (13–15).
Achieving oral bioavailability has remained a key challenge in
the design of ER downregulators and until now no oral estrogen
receptor downregulators, other than GDC-0810 and RAD1901,
have progressed into clinical trials, despite encouraging reports
from others of preclinical activity in mouse xenograft models
(16–21). Here, we describe a chemically novel, nonsteroidal ERa
antagonist and downregulator, AZD9496, that can be administered orally and links increased tumor growth inhibition to
enhanced biomarker modulation compared with fulvestrant in
a preclinical in vivo model of breast cancer. Moreover, we show
that AZD9496 is a potent inhibitor of ESR1-mutant receptors and
can drive tumor growth inhibition in a patient-derived ESR1
mutant in vivo model (PDX). Hence, AZD9496 is anticipated to
yield improved bioavailability and clinical beneﬁt through
enhanced ER pathway modulation.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
All AZ cell lines were tested and authenticated by short-tandem
repeat (STR) analysis. MCF-7 was obtained from DSMZ and last
STR tested in February 2013. MDA-MB-361 (STR tested in October
2011), MDA-MB-134 (STR tested in October 2010), T47D (STR
tested in June 2012), CAMA-1 (STR tested in March 2012),
HCC1428 (STR tested in December 2011), HCC70 (STR tested
in October 2013), LnCAP (STR tested in August 2011), MDA-MB468 (STR tested in March 2014), BT474 (STR tested in July 2013),
PC3 (STR tested in October 2012), HCT116 (STR tested in August
2011) were all obtained from the ATCC. HCC1428-LTED cell line
(STR tested in November 2012) was kindly provided by Carlos
Arteaga (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; ref. 22). Cells were
cultured in RPMI1640 media (Corning) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated FCS or charcoal/dextran–treated CCS to deplete
hormone and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Corning). Stable MCF-7 cell
lines expressing FLAG-tagged ESR1-mutant proteins in pTRIPZ
lentiviral vectors (GE Healthcare) under the control of the doxycycline-inducible Tet promoter were generated by lentiviral infection using standard techniques.
Biochemical and in vitro cell assays
Binding, ER agonism, antagonism, downregulation, and cell
proliferation assays were carried out as described previously (23).
BIAcore afﬁnity measurements and immunoblotting from compound-treated cells are described in Supplementary Methods.
Protein production, crystallization, and structure
determination
Protein expression, puriﬁcation, and crystallization of the ERa
ligand-binding domain was carried out as described previously
(24). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the ESRF on beamline
ID23-1 on an ADSC detector. Data were processed using XDS (25)
as implemented within EDNA (26) and scaled and merged using
SCALA (27). The structure of ERa in complex with AZD9496 was
solved by molecular replacement using AmoRE and an internal

3308 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

ERa structure as the search model (28). Quality checks on the
protein structures were carried out using the validation tools in
Coot (29). The ﬁnal structure has been deposited in the Protein
Databank with the ID code given in Supplementary Table S1.
Stable isotope labeling of amino acids and mass spectrometry
Stable isotope labeling of amino acids (SILAC) assays were
carried out as described previously (30) and detailed in Supplementary Methods. Compound-treated samples were analyzed by
mass spectrometry using relative peptide quantiﬁcation by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Degradation half-life was measured using the one-phase exponential decay equation in GraphPad PRISM (Y ¼ Span.eK.X þ Plateau), where X is time and Y is
response, which starts out as Span þ Plateau and decreases to
Plateau with a rate constant K.
Rat uterine and xenograft studies
All studies involving animals in the United Kingdom were
conducted in accordance with UK Home Ofﬁce legislation, the
Animal Scientiﬁc Procedures Act 1986, and AstraZeneca Global
Bioethics policy or with US federal, state, and institutional guidelines in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care–accredited facility. The rat uterine weight
assay for the measurement of estrogenic activity was performed as
described previously (31). Details of individual models, protein
analysis of tumor fragments, and pharmacokinetic analysis of
plasma samples are included in Supplementary Methods.

Results
AZD9496 is a selective ERa antagonist, downregulator, and
inhibitor of ERþ tumor cell growth
AZD9496 ((E)-3-(3,5-diﬂuoro-4-((1R,3R)-2-(2-ﬂuoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-1-yl)
phenyl)acrylic acid; Fig. 1A) was identiﬁed through structure-based
design and iterative medicinal chemistry structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies from a novel ER-binding motif (32). A directed
ER-binding screen was established to identify novel binding motifs
that could then be optimized for both cellular phenotype and
potency while maintaining good pharmacokinetic properties
(23). Unlike fulvestrant, and other well-known historical modulators of the ER receptor, including hydroxytamoxifen (Fig. 1B),
AZD9496 lacks a phenolic moiety in which the phenol mimics the
A-ring phenol group of the endogenous ligand estradiol but gains its
potency through a different series of novel interactions with the ER
protein (Fig. 1C). The indole NH picks up an interaction by forming
a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of Leu-346, with additional
lipophilic interactions achieved by both the chiral methyl substituent, adjacent to the ring nitrogen, and the N-substituted isopropyl
ﬂuoro side-chain occupying a "lipophilic hole" in the ER protein.
The acrylic acid side chain picks up an unusual acid–acid colocalization with Asp-351 in the helix-12 region of the ER that has been
proposed to be crucial for achieving a downregulator–antagonist
proﬁle (33). AZD9496 showed high oral bioavailability across three
species (F% 63, 91, and 74, rat, mouse, and dog, respectively) with
generally low volume and clearance across species, albeit a higher
clearance in mouse. The percent free levels in human plasma of
0.15% were 5-fold higher than those measured for fulvestrant.
The key characteristics of a SERD is the ability to both
antagonize and downregulate ER protein without inducing any
partial agonist effects in breast cells. A series of in vitro cell

assays were developed speciﬁcally to measure ERa downregulation, agonism, and antagonism through simultaneous measurement of ER and PR protein levels in cells after treatment
with AZD9496 (23). PR expression is known to be regulated by
ER transcription and was measured as a marker of ER activation
in cells (34). The potency of AZD9496 approached that
observed with fulvestrant in achieving pmol/L IC50 in ERa
binding, downregulation, and antagonism and signiﬁcant cell
growth inhibition in hormone-depleted growth conditions.
Adding 250 nmol/L tamoxifen signiﬁcantly lowered the IC50
value, as expected, if AZD9496 and tamoxifen are competing
for binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD; Table 1). The
potent downregulation of ERa was also veriﬁed by immunoblotting techniques (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To understand the binding kinetics of AZD9496 to human ERa
LBD, binding studies were performed in the presence of increasing
concentrations of AZD9496 and association (kass) and dissociation (kdiss) rate constants were calculated. AZD9496 was calcu-

lated as having an apparent dissociation rate constant (kdiss) for
ERa LBD of 0.00043/sec, at 25 C equating to a half-life (t1/2) of
27  2 minutes and the afﬁnity derived from the ratio of the
rate constants gave a Kd of 0.33 nmol/L (Supplementary
Table S2). This is in good agreement with the binding IC50 of
0.82 nmol/L and correlates well with previously published data
on estrogen and tamoxifen binding to ER LBD (35). AZD9496
showed pmol/L equipotent binding to both ERa and ERb
isoforms, as expected, given their high sequence homology
and similarity in tertiary structure in their LBDs (36), and highly
selective binding compared with progesterone (650-fold),
glucocorticoid (11,223-fold), and androgen (36,375-fold)
receptor LBDs (Supplementary Table S3). Selectivity for ER was
also evident by measuring cell growth inhibition in a panel of ERþ
and ER cell lines (Supplementary Table S4). No signiﬁcant
growth inhibition was seen in any ER cell lines (EC50 >
10 mmol/L) in contrast to the low nanomolar activity seen in a
range of ERþ cell lines.

AZD9496 directly targets ERa for downregulation in vitro
To measure the rate at which AZD9496 downregulated ERa,
SILAC experiments were performed in MCF-7 cells using mass
spectroscopy analysis to detect ERa protein levels after treatment with compounds. Addition of AZD9496 or fulvestrant
increased the rate of degradation of the isotope-labeled ERa
compared with DMSO control. Levels of newly synthesized ERa
peptide were also reduced following AZD9496 and fulvestrant
treatment, presumably due to ongoing degradation of newly
synthesized ERa protein by compound present, whereas ERa
protein levels continued to increase over time in the presence of
tamoxifen or DMSO (Fig. 2). The t1/2 of ERa was decreased
from 3 hours, in the presence of DMSO, to 0.75 hours with 100
nmol/L AZD9496 and 0.6 hours with 100 nmol/L fulvestrant
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Downregulation of ER occurs through
the 26S proteosomal pathway as no decrease in ERa protein
level in MCF-7 cells was seen in the presence of the proteosome
inhibitor MG132 (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, ERa
downregulation was shown to be reversible in compound
wash-out experiments, where ERa levels increased in a timedependent manner back to basal levels over a 48-hour period
following compound removal (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Agonism of ERa in human breast and uterine cells
In contrast to an AstraZeneca reference compound
(AZ10557841), which has known ERa agonist activity in breast
cells, AZD9496 was shown to cause no increase in PR protein levels
but rather a slight decrease below the detected basal levels
(Fig. 3A). Some endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, can act
as partial ER agonists in certain tissues, for example, endometrium,
due to conformational changes that take place at the ER and the
resulting effect on cofactor recruitment and transcriptional gene
activation from the tamoxifen-bound receptor (37). To test whether AZD9496 could act as a partial agonist in other tissues, agonist
effects were measured in vivo in a previously validated immature
female rat model designed to detect agonistic properties of test
compounds by measuring increases in uterine weight (31).
AZD9496, given once daily orally at 5 and 25 mg/kg produced
statistically signiﬁcant increases in uterine weight compared with
the fulvestrant control (P < 0.001) but signiﬁcantly lower than
tamoxifen (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3B). Histologic staining of uterine tissue
samples also showed that the lengthening of the endometrial cells
in the rat uteri appeared to have decreased compared with tamox-

3310 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

ifen (Fig. 3C). In further studies, ERa protein levels were reduced
with fulvestrant and AZD9496, but not tamoxifen, compared with
relevant vehicle controls, whereas PR levels were signiﬁcantly
increased with tamoxifen alone (Fig. 3D).
AZD9496 is a potent, oral inhibitor of breast tumor growth
in vivo
The effect of chronic, oral dosing of AZD9496 was explored in
MCF-7 human breast xenografts, as a representative ERþ/PRþ/
HER2þ breast cancer model. Good bioavailability and high clearance gave a terminal t1/2 of 5–6 hours after oral dosing in the mouse
and resulted in signiﬁcant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with 96% inhibition at 50 mg/kg and no toxicity or weight loss
relative to the vehicle control group (Fig. 4A). To conﬁrm that
AZD9496 was targeting the ER pathway, PR protein levels were
measured in tumor samples taken at the end of the study and a
signiﬁcant reduction in PR was seen, which correlated with tumor
growth inhibition. A >90% reduction in PR was seen with both 10
and 50 mg/kg doses and a 75% decrease even with the 0.5 mg/kg
dose, demonstrating that AZD9496 can clearly antagonize the ER
pathway (Fig. 4B). Dosing 5 mg/kg of AZD9496, the minimal dose
required to see signiﬁcant tumor inhibition, gave greater tumor
growth inhibition compared with 5 mg/mouse fulvestrant given 3
times weekly and tamoxifen given 10 mg/kg orally, daily (Fig. 4C).
A series of pharmacodynamic in vivo studies were conducted to
measure time taken to reach maximal inhibition of PR levels and
time taken to recover back to basal levels. Three days of dosing with
5 mg/kg of AZD9496 gave 98% reduction of PR protein and
continued to suppress protein levels at 48 hours (Fig. 4D), with
full recovery by 72 hours (data not shown), which indicates a long
pharmacologic half-life in vivo. Fulvestrant, given as 3  5 mg/
mouse doses over one week, gave a 60% reduction in PR protein
over a prolonged period with measured plasma levels approximately 8-fold higher than those achieved clinically, at steady
state, with 500 mg fulvestrant (Fig. 4E). As estrogen itself is
known to downregulate ER protein (38, 39), we were unable to
detect further decreases in ERa protein compared with control
animals with AZD9496 or fulvestrant in the MCF-7 model
presumably due to the high circulating plasma levels of estrogen from implanted pellets at the time tumor samples were
taken (Supplementary Fig. S5). A mouse-speciﬁc metabolite of
AZD9496 was detected in circulating plasma at similar levels to
AZD9496 and showed a similar pharmacokinetic proﬁle. Testing this metabolite in the in vitro MCF-7 assays resulted in
approximately 5-fold lower ERa antagonism activity and 7-fold
lower ERa downregulation activity than AZD9496 (data not
shown). Using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model
based on PR inhibition data, at the 5 mg/kg dose in vivo, which
gives 98% inhibition of PR, the inhibitory activity that could be
attributed to the parent compound alone was 85% when the
activity of the metabolite was discounted.
To explore mechanistic effects on ER pathway regulation further, a gene expression analysis study was performed using tumor
samples dosed at 10 mg/kg for 3 days with AZD9496 or tamoxifen
and fulvestrant given as a single dose 5 mg dose subcutaneously.
Tumors were taken 24 hours after the last dose of AZD9496 and
tamoxifen and mRNA levels measured using a Human Transcriptome Array (HTA 2.0). A number of known ER-regulated genes
were examined to see whether AZD9496 could antagonize these
genes in a similar manner to fulvestrant and tamoxifen (40–42).
The heatmap shows that AZD9496 could indeed downregulate

the mRNA levels of estrogen-responsive genes (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). As differences in the levels of mRNA downregulation in
vivo could be due to different pharmacokinetic proﬁles of the
molecules, the effects of compounds on the mRNA levels of a
subset of estrogen-regulated genes were also measured in MCF-7
cells that had been treated with or without estrogen (Supplementary Fig. S6B–S6E). For two of these genes, TFF1 and AREG,
tamoxifen was shown to increase mRNA levels in the absence of
estrogen but not with either fulvestrant or AZD9496 (Supplementary Fig. S6D and S6E). Where transcript levels were increased
to varying levels in the presence of estrogen, fulvestrant and
AZD9496 inhibited transcript levels in a dose-dependent fashion
compared with tamoxifen. No signiﬁcant effects were seen in
ESR1 mRNA levels in vitro, indicating that the protein downregulation described previously is due to downregulation of the
protein and not a decrease in transcript levels per se (Supplementary Fig. S6F).
AZD9496 causes tumor regressions in combination with PI3K
pathway and CDK4/6 inhibitors and in an estrogen-deprived
ERþ model of resistance
Acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens
is driven through a variety of mechanisms, which include effects
on the ER pathway itself, i.e., downregulation of ER expression
and altered expression of ER coregulators, as well as activation of
alternative prosurvival or proliferative pathways and cross-talk
between growth factor receptors and ER pathways. This has led to
a number of clinical trials with PIK3, mTOR, AKT inhibitors, as
well as CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant and early results have shown increased
progression-free survival (PFS) in many cases (43). Combinations
of AZD9496 with AZD2014 (dual mTORC1/2), AZD8835
(PIK3Ca/d) and palbociclib (CDK4/6) inhibitors were tested in

www.aacrjournals.org

the MCF-7 in vivo model and in all cases tumor regressions seen
with the combination arms alone compared with tumor stasis
with monotherapy (Fig. 5A–C). AZD9496 was also tested in a
long-term estrogen-deprived model (LTED), using the HCC-1428
LTED cell line that was previously adapted to grow in the absence
of estrogen and as such represents a model of aromatase inhibitor
resistance (22). Tumor regressions were seen with both AZD9496
and fulvestrant (Fig. 5D) and both compounds completed ablated ER protein levels in the end-of-study tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
AZD9496 antagonizes and downregulates mutant ER in vitro
and in vivo
The recent identiﬁcation of ESR1 mutations in patients that had
received one or more endocrine therapy treatments has led to the
discovery that these mutations can drive cell proliferation in the
absence of estrogen and may constitute a resistance mechanism to
some endocrine agents. In vitro binding studies were performed
using wt, D538G, and Y537S LBDs and both AZD9496 and
fulvestrant were able to bind to mutant LBD with nmol/L potency
although 2- to 3-fold reduced compared with wt (Table 2). The
different IC50 values obtained for binding of AZD9496 and
fulvestrant to wt ERa compared with the value in Table 1 is

likely due to different sources of protein used in the Lanthascreen
kit assays versus the laboratory-derived wt and ESR1-mutant
proteins. Downregulation of ER-mutant proteins was measured
using MCF-7 doxycycline-inducible stable cell lines in vitro. ER
protein levels increased on induction with 1 mg/mL doxycycline
and led to increased levels of PR in the absence of estrogen.
AZD9496 and fulvestrant were able to downregulate all mutant
ER proteins and decreased PR levels, whereas tamoxifen appeared
to stabilize ER protein levels and reduced PR levels to a lesser
extent (Fig. 6A). To explore activity against an ESR1 mutant in vivo,
tumor growth inhibition studies were performed in a PDX
model, CTC-174, which harbors a D538G mutation in the LBD
and constituted 31% of the transcripts variants identiﬁed by RNAseq analysis. Tumors were grown from implanted tumor fragments either with or without estrogen and in both cases viable
tumors grew. Given published data that higher doses of SERM/
SERDs may be needed to inhibit ESR1 mutants (14, 15), 25 mg/kg

of AZD9496 was used alongside 5 mg/mouse of fulvestrant,
which was known to achieve higher pharmacokinetic levels in
mouse than the current clinical dose. AZD9496 and fulvestrant
inhibited tumor growth by 66% and 59% respectively, compared
with tamoxifen, which gave 28% inhibition. Efﬁcacy correlated
with antagonism of the pathway with AZD9496 giving a 94%
decrease in PR levels compared with 63% with fulvestrant (Fig. 6B
and C). In the absence of estrogen, and given the signiﬁcant PR
changes seen with 25 mg/kg, the dose of AZD9496 was lowered
but a 5 mg/kg dose still achieved growth inhibition of approximately 70% and led to a signiﬁcant decrease of 73% in ERa
protein levels at the end of the study (Fig. 6D and E). Given the
similarities in growth inhibition either with or without estrogen,
residual tumor growth is likely to be due to either additional
mutations (e.g., PIKCA N345K) and/or growth factor signaling
pathways involved in driving tumor growth in addition to the ER
pathway.

Discussion
Despite the enhanced clinical beneﬁts of directly antagonizing
and downregulating ER and thereby targeting any ligand-independent ER-driven pathways, the pharmacokinetic and IHC biomarker data for ER, PR, and Ki67 from clinical trials with fulvestrant would suggest that a plateau of effect has not been reached,
and there is scope to further improve on the 50% reduction in ER
levels seen after 6 months of treatment (8, 12). As one of the
potential drawbacks associated with fulvestrant is the very low
bioavailability, which is seen both in patients and in preclinical
animal models, a potent, orally bioavailable SERD could have the
potential to signiﬁcantly antagonize ER activity and increase ERa
receptor knockdown versus fulvestrant due to higher exposures.
Our approach focused on identifying novel ER motifs with
established drug-like properties that could then be optimized for
cellular phenotype and potency and led to the identiﬁcation of
AZD9496, which showed picomolar potency in vitro in ERþ cell
lines only. Previous structural analysis of a number of SERMs with
ERa LBD identiﬁed key interactions with Asp 351, which was
shown to be critical for the antagonist activity of antiestrogens
such as raloxifene, lasofoxifene, and GW5638 through shielding
or neutralization of the negative charge. Unlike tamoxifen, however, GW5638 repositioned residues helix-12 through its acrylate
side chain, increasing the exposed hydrophobic surface of ERa,
resulting in destabilization and ultimately 26S proteosomal degradation of the receptor. The acrylic acid moiety of AZD9496 is
colocalized with the Asp 351 residue in the helix-12 region of ER
in an unusual acid–acid interaction, and it is therefore proposed
that AZD9496 also repositions residues associated with the helix12 via speciﬁc contacts with the N-terminus region, resulting in a
mixed antagonist and downregulator proﬁle (33, 44). Evidence
that AZD9496 was directly binding and downregulating the
receptor at the same site as other antiestrogens was seen by the
reduced potency observed on prior addition of tamoxifen to the
downregulation assay (Table 1). Mechanistically, we have shown
that AZD9496 has very similar effects on antagonism, ERa downregulation, and agonism to fulvestrant. Even where ERa was
overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, unlike tamoxifen, AZD9496 was
able to downregulate and antagonize the overexpressed receptor
(Fig. 6A). Our transcriptional studies in both MCF-7 cells and the
in vivo model also demonstrated antagonism of the transcriptional activity of the receptor as seen by decreased mRNA levels of ERactivated genes in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.
S6).
Unlike fulvestrant, AZD9496 did show some degree of agonism
in endometrial tissue (Fig. 3). This effect was dose independent
and would indicate that there are subtle differences in how
AZD9496 interacts with ERa compared with tamoxifen and
fulvestrant and therefore the extent to which tissue speciﬁc coactivators can interact with the receptor. Given the widespread use of
tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting for 5–10 years, the low level of
agonism seen with AZD9496 is not viewed as a deterrent for
clinical development. A number of studies have looked at the
incidence of endometrial cancer in patients taking tamoxifen over
a number of years and despite the small increase in the incidence
of endometrial cancer, the beneﬁts of tamoxifen greatly outweigh
any risks of developing uterine malignancy in postmenopausal
patients (45, 46).
A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic efﬁcacy model was
established, integrating diverse endpoints such as drug exposure,

3316 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

PR modulation, and inhibition of tumor growth (data not
shown). The model reﬂected relative contributions of AZD9496
and its active mouse metabolite to the overall biomarker modulation and efﬁcacy. Given the half-life of the parent drug and
metabolite are around 5 hours, to explain the prolonged pharmacodynamic effect observed with AZD9496 at 48 hours, an
indirect response model for PR was developed, which estimated a
degradation rate constant of around 23 hours for PR. This modulation in PR was linked directly to tumor growth inhibition by a
proportional decrease of the tumor growth constant, and correlated well with the wide range of measured efﬁcacies.
We consistently saw enhanced tumor growth inhibition of
AZD9496 compared with fulvestrant in the MCF-7 in vivo model
(Fig. 4). This model contains high circulating levels of plasma
estradiol over the dosing period of the study as a result of the
estrogen pellets used to drive growth of the MCF-7 cells as a
xenograft. With plasma levels between 750 and 1,000 pg/mL over
day 21–35, this model is more representative of the premenopausal setting where estrogen levels can vary between 20 and 400
pg/mL (47). As the receptor binding data does not suggest a
signiﬁcant difference in afﬁnity for the receptor between
AZD9496 and fulvestrant, increased efﬁcacy is likely due to the
higher free drug levels of AZD9496 versus fulvestrant in this
model. It would therefore be interesting to test the activity of
potent oral SERDs, such as AZD9496, in the premenopausal
setting where there is no enhanced risk of endometrial cancer
observed for tamoxifen.
We were unable to detect a reduction in ER protein levels in the
MCF-7 in vivo model with AZD9496 at any dose tested (data not
shown). Having shown in vitro that estradiol can efﬁciently downregulate ERa protein, we postulate that downregulation of ERa by
estradiol is already taking place in vivo given the high levels of
circulating estrogen and that any additional changes by addition
of a SERD are difﬁcult to detect using the current methods. This
was supported by measuring ERa downregulation in in vivo
models, such as CTC-174 and HCC1428LTED, not requiring
estrogen supplements, and showing potent downregulation of
ERa by AZD9496 (Fig. 6E, Supplementary Fig. S7). The level of
ERa reduction seen in the HCC1428 model is greater than seen
clinically, with pharmacokinetic levels 5-fold higher than steadystate plasma levels of 500 mg fulvestrant, and supports the
concept that if increased plasma levels of an active SERD agent
could be achieved clinically, greater ERa knockdown may be
possible. Preclinically, this appears to translate to enhanced
tumor growth inhibition.
Achieving increased serum levels of a biologically active SERD
could be particularly beneﬁcial in the recently identiﬁed ESR1mutant patient setting. Preclinical in vivo studies using PDX
models derived from ESR1-mutant patients grown in the absence
of estrogen supplementation have shown that high doses of
fulvestrant (>500 mg/kg) can lead to tumor regression and
signiﬁcant decreases in ER protein levels but at signiﬁcantly higher
doses than could be achieved clinically (48). Our preclinical data
would indicate that both AZD9496 and fulvestrant can potently
bind and downregulate D538G and Y537C/N/S ERa proteins in
vitro and signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition rather than regression seen in vivo. This is in contrast to published work showing
relatively little downregulation of Y537N mutant protein in vitro
with increasing doses of fulvestrant (15) but could be attributed to
different expression systems and cell lines used for the analysis. It
is notable that the doxycycline-inducible mutant receptors do not

appear to be constitutively downregulated in a similar manner to
wt ER exposed to estradiol (Supplementary Fig. S1). This may be
due to the level of overexpression of the receptor in each stable cell
line and it will be interesting to compare these ﬁndings from
engineered expression systems to those from genetically altered
mutant cell lines where expression is under control of the native
promoter. Although very high doses of both compounds were not
tested in the PDX CTC-174 ESR1-mutant model, the lack of any
signiﬁcant dose response might indicate the need to inhibit other
growth factor–activated pathways in addition to the ER pathway
to achieve signiﬁcant antitumor growth. As trials commence to
explore treatment of ESR1-mutant patients with new oral SERDs,
data will hopefully emerge that will indicate whether lack of
response is due to inability to fully inhibit mutated ER receptors
or whether, in these advanced metastatic patients, other mutations
and pathways are or become dominant in driving tumor growth.
In metastatic breast cancer, the median survival time is still
around two years as a result of acquired endocrine resistance,
highlighting the need for additional therapies (43). This has led to
a number of clinical trials using PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway inhibitors in combination with AIs as well as cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors such as palbociclib, which was recently approved for
combination treatment with letrozole in the metastatic breast
cancer. Results from the phase III BOLERO-2 trial also demonstrated the PFS beneﬁts of a steroidal AI plus everolimus in
patients that had progressed on a nonsteroidal AI (49). More
recently, further trials have been initiated using fulvestrant as the
combination endocrine partner, which will allow analysis and
understanding of any additional beneﬁt from combination with a
SERD versus AIs in this setting. Our data clearly demonstrated
enhanced combination effects on tumor growth of an oral SERD
agent with either dual mTORC1/2, PIKCa/d or CDK4/6 inhibitors
and furthermore opens up the possibility of using a combined
endocrine and targeted inhibitor approach with longer term
dosing in the adjuvant setting, assuming emerging data from
ongoing metastatic trials supports the testing of combinations in
early breast disease. The identiﬁcation of a potent, orally bioavailable compound such as AZD9496 is a step forward in the next
generation of SERD agents to undergo clinical evaluation as a
future monotherapy or combination partner of choice.
