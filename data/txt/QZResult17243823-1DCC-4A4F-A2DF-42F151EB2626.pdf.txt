Abstract
Resistance to standard chemotherapy agents remains a major obstacle for
improving treatment outcomes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The Bcl-2-selective
inhibitor ABT-199 has demonstrated encouraging preclinical results, drug resistance
remains a concern. Mcl-1 has been demonstrated to contribute to ABT-199 resistance,
thus combining with therapies that target Mcl-1 could overcome such resistance. In
this study, we utilized a CHK1 inhibitor, LY2603618, to decrease Mcl-1 and enhance
ABT-199 efficacy. We found that LY2603618 treatment resulted in abolishment of the
G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and increased DNA damage, which was partially dependent
on CDK activity. LY2603618 treatment resulted in decrease of Mcl-1, which coincided
with the initiation of apoptosis. Overexpression of Mcl-1 in AML cells significantly
attenuated apoptosis induced by LY2603618, confirming the critical role of Mcl-1
in apoptosis induced by the agent. Simultaneous treatment with LY2603618 and
ABT-199 resulted in synergistic induction of apoptosis in both AML cell lines and
primary patient samples. Our findings provide new insights into overcoming a
mechanism of intrinsic ABT-199 resistance in AML cells and support the clinical
development of combined ABT-199 and CHK1 inhibition.

Introduction

One strategy to overcome chemoresistance is to
target the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, as they have
been demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical
outcome and chemoresistance in leukemic cell line models
[5–8]. ABT-199 is the first Bcl-2-selective inhibitor that
has demonstrated promising results in multiple cancers,
including AML [9–15], though drug resistance remains
a concern. We and others have previously demonstrated
that Mcl-1 plays a key role in resistance to ABT-199
[12, 16–18]. In our most recent study, we demonstrate that
induction of Mcl-1 by ABT-199 represents an intrinsic
mechanism of resistance to the agent in AML cells [19].

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a
devastating disease. The overall survival rate for adults is
only about 25% [1] and although the overall survival rate
for children is around 65% [2], it lags significantly behind
that of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is about 90%
for the pediatric population [3]. A major cause of treatment
failure is resistance to cytarabine (ara-C) and anthracycline
[e.g., daunorubicin (DNR)]-based chemotherapy [4]. Thus,
novel therapies are needed to overcome chemoresistance
and improve the overall survival of AML patients.

Thus, rationally designed combinations could prove to
be a more effective option for the treatment of AML with
ABT-199.
Targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) is
another approach to overcome chemotherapy resistance.
The DDR involves multiple signaling pathways through
which cells maintain genomic integrity following various
stresses [20–23]. Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) plays
a central role in the DDR and its inhibition can affect
replication initiation, replication fork stability, homologous
recombination repair, progression of the cell cycle, and
the S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints [20–22, 24].
In addition, CHK1 inhibition has been demonstrated to
result in DNA damage [25] and DNA damage has been
shown to result in decrease of Mcl-1 expression [26].
Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibition of CHK1 may
enhance the cytotoxic effects of ABT-199 by decreasing
Mcl-1 expression.
Here, we evaluated the CHK1-selective inhibitor
LY2603618 in combination with ABT-199 in AML cell
lines and primary patient samples. We demonstrated
that LY2603618 treatment resulted in DNA damage and
decrease of Mcl-1 expression, which coincided with
the initiation of apoptosis. Simultaneous combination
of LY2603618 and ABT-199 resulted in synergistic
induction of cell death in both AML cell lines and primary
patient samples. These findings provide new insights into
overcoming intrinsic ABT-199 resistance in AML cells
and supports clinical development of the combination of
ABT-199 and CHK1 inhibitors.

lack of a correlation between CHK1 transcript levels
and LY2603618 IC50s in the primary patient samples,
ectopic expression of CHK1 in THP-1 AML cell line
had no impact on LY2603618 sensitivity, as assessed
by MTT assay (Figure 1D, the western blot confirming
overexpression was published previously [28]). However,
shRNA knockdown of CHK1 (50% decrease of CHK1
protein compared to NTC shRNA) resulted in a significant
increase of LY2603618 sensitivity in THP-1 cells (1.6-fold,
p = 0.023 , Figure 1E and 1F).

LY2603618 induces bak-dependent apoptosis in
AML cell lines
To assess the effect of LY2603618 treatment on cell
death, first we treated five AML cell lines (CTS, MOLM-13,
MV4-11, THP-1, and U937) and one primary AML
patient sample (AML #31) with variable concentrations of
LY2603618 for 24 h and then subjected them to Annexin
V/propidium iodide (PI) staining, and flow cytometry
analyses. LY2603618 treatment resulted in concentrationdependent increase in Annexin V positive cells (Figure 2A
and 2B). The U937 cells treated with LY2603618 for 24 h
were mostly dead, as indicated by AnnexinV+/PI+, so
the treatment was performed with a shorter incubation
to determine if the cells underwent apoptosis. After 8 h
treatment, U937 cells showed concentration-dependent
increase in AnnexinV+PI- cells, indicating that the cells
underwent apoptosis. LY2603618-induced cell death, in all
cell lines tested, was accompanied by cleavage of caspase 3
and PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase, Figure 2C),
demonstrating that the cells underwent apoptosis. To
determine if the cells did indeed undergo intrinsic
apoptosis, we performed shRNA knockdown of Bax
and Bak, at least one of which is required for intrinsic
apoptosis [29]. The LY2603618-induced increase of
Annexin V positive cells was diminished by shRNA
knockdown of Bak, but not Bax, demonstrating that
LY2603618 induces Bak-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in
AML cells (Figure 2D and 2E).

RESULTS
LY2603618 has antileukemic activity against
primary AML patient samples and AML cell lines
To investigate LY2603618 sensitivity in AML
patient samples and cell lines, first we determined
ex vivo LY2603618 sensitivity in freshly isolated primary
AML blast samples obtained either at initial diagnosis
(n = 22) or at relapse (n = 4) by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) assays.
For the majority of the primary patient samples (n = 23),
the LY2603618 IC50s were less than 9 µM, which is
the maximum clinically achievable concentration of
LY2603618 [27]. Interestingly, there was no significant
difference between the median LY2603618 IC50 for the
AML blasts obtained at initial diagnosis and relapse
(p = 0.749, Table 1 and Figure 1A). Next, we determined
CHK1 transcript levels in the primary AML patient
samples by real-time RT-PCR. CHK1 transcript levels did
not correlate with LY2603618 sensitivities in the samples
(Figure 1B). Then we tested LY2603618 sensitivities in 11
AML cell lines by MTT assays. The IC50s of LY2603618
in these cell lines ranged from about 0.1–1.6 µM
after 72 h treatment (Figure 1C). Consistent with the

LY2603618 treatment decreases the G2/M cell
population and increases DNA damage in AML
cell lines
To investigate the effects of LY2603618 treatment
on cell cycle progression, we treated CTS, THP-1, and
U937 cells with LY2603618 for 24 h. PI staining and flow
cytometry analyses revealed a concentration-dependent
decrease of the G2/M population accompanied by
concentration-dependent increase of sub-G1 population
(Figures 3A, S1 and S2). Decreased protein levels for
CHK1 were detected after LY2603618 treatment of the
U937 cells. Although treatment with high concentrations
of LY2603618 resulted in decreased levels of p-CDC25C
and p-CDK1 (phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase 1),

it did not alter the levels of phosphorylated histone H3
(p-H3, a marker for mitosis) (Figure 3B). Increased levels
of p-CHK1 (S345), indicative of DNA damage, were
detected in LY2603618 treated cells. In addition, there
was a concentration-dependent increase of γH2AX post
LY2603618 treatments, further suggesting that LY2603618
induced DNA damage in the cells.
To evaluate if LY2603618 treatment truly induced
DNA damage and determine the relationship between the
induced DNA damage and CDK activity, U937 cells were
treated with LY2603618 and Roscovitine (a CDK inhibitor),
alone and in combination, for 16 h and then subjected
to the alkaline comet assay. As shown in Figure 3C
and 3D, LY2603618 treatment resulted in significantly
increased percent DNA in the tail, which was significantly
attenuated by the addition of Roscovitine. Essentially
the same results were also obtained with a primary AML
patient sample AML#111 (AML M2, Figure 3E and 3F). In
addition, Roscovitine significantly mitigated LY2603618www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced apoptosis in both CTS and U937 cells (Figure 3G
and 3I), accompanied by decreased levels of γH2AX,
cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 3H and 3J).
These results demonstrate that LY2603618 induces DNA
damage and apoptosis in AML cells by a process which is
at least partially dependent on CDK activity.

Decrease of Mcl-1 plays an important role in
LY2603618-induced apoptosis in AML cell lines
It has been previously demonstrated that DNA
damage can cause decreased expression of Mcl-1,
which plays an important role in DNA damage-induced
apoptosis [26]. It is conceivable that LY2603618
treatment induces DNA damage which causes decreased
expression of Mcl-1, leading to apoptosis in AML cells.
To test this possibility, we investigated the effects of
LY2603618 treatment on the Bcl-2 family proteins in
U937 cells. While protein levels for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bak,

ABT-199 treatment alone did not cause significant DNA
damage after 8 h treatment, as assessed by alkaline
comet assay (Figure 5A and 5B). However, the combined
treatment resulted in a significant increase in DNA damage.
In addition, LY2603618 treatment abrogated the increase
of Mcl-1 seen with ABT-199 treatment (Figure 5C).
Furthermore, the combined drug treatment resulted in
synergistic induction of apoptosis in U937 cells (Figure 5D),
which was accompanied by increased cleavage of PARP
and caspase-3 (Figure 5C). Similar results were also
obtained in THP-1 cells (another relatively resistant AML
cell line with an ABT-199 IC50 of 2.4 μM, as determined
previously [12], Figure 5E and 5F).

Bax, and Bim remained unchanged post treatment with
LY2603618 for 24 h, protein levels for Mcl-1 decreased
significantly in cells treated with higher concentrations
of LY2603618 (Figure 4A–4C), which correlated with
much higher levels of apoptosis induced by the agent
(Figure 2B). Interestingly, Roscovitine partially abolished
the decrease of Mcl-1 induced by treatment with
LY2603618 (Figure 4D), demonstrating that CDK activity
contributed to the decrease of Mcl-1. To determine if Mcl-1
inhibits LY2603618-induced apoptosis, we ectopically
overexpressed Mcl-1 (U937/Mcl-1) and red fluorescent
protein (U937/RFP) in U937 cells (50% increase
compared to U937/RFP cells, Figure 4E). As shown in
Figure 4F, apoptosis induced by LY2603618 in the U937/
Mcl-1 cells was significantly lower than that in U937/RFP
cells, demonstrating that decrease of Mcl-1 contributes to
LY2603618-induced apoptosis in AML cells.
To further elucidate the relationship among DNA
damage, Mcl-1 levels, and apoptosis, we treated U937
cells with LY2603618 for up to 24 h and then subjected
whole cell lysates to western blotting. These experiments
revealed a time-dependent increase of γH2AX, cleaved
PARP and cleaved caspase3 as well as a time-dependent
decrease of Mcl-1 (Figure 4G). It is important to note
that obvious changes of γH2AX and Mcl-1 began at 4 h
and were accompanied by a minor but statistically
significant induction of apoptosis by LY2603618
(Figure 4H). To determine if CDK activity contributed
to the induction of DNA damage, decrease of Mcl-1, and
apoptosis by LY2603618, we treated U937 cells with
LY2603618 and Roscovitine, alone or in combination, for
8 h. Roscovitine treatment abrogated LY2603618-induced
apoptosis and rescued Mcl-1 protein (Figure 4I and 4J).
However, Roscovitine treatment could only partially
inhibit LY2603618-induced γH2AX. Similar results
were obtained in CTS cells (Figure S3). These results
demonstrate that LY2603618 treatment causes decreased
expression of Mcl-1 and induces apoptosis in a partially
CDK-dependent fashion in AML cells.

LY2603618 enhances ABT-199-induced apoptosis
in primary AML patient samples
Then we tested the antileukemic effects of
LY2603618 and ABT-199 in two primary patient samples
which were relatively resistance to ABT-199 (AML#31
ABT-199 IC50 was 1 µM and AML#38 ABT-199 IC50
was 5 µM, as determined by MTT assays) by Annexin
V/PI staining and flow cytometry analyses (patient
characteristics are presented in Table 1). In agreement with
the AML cell lines, LY2603618 combined with ABT-199
resulted in synergistic induction of cell death (Figure 6A
and 6B). Finally, we tested the combined drug treatments
in 10 primary AML patient samples which were relatively
resistance to ABT-199 (IC50s ranging from 1 µM to 20 µM
by MTT assays) by MTT assays and standard isobologram
analyses. Again, the combined drug treatments resulted
in synergistic antileukemic activities against the primary
patient samples (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated using a CHK1
inhibitor as a DNA damaging agent to decrease Mcl-1
protein levels and enhance ABT-199 sensitivity in AML
cells, based on a previous report that DNA damage can
cause decreased expression of Mcl-1 in cancer cells [26].
We found that primary patient samples obtained at initial
diagnosis and relapse had similar sensitivities to the
CHK1 inhibitor LY2603618, suggesting that this agent
could be used for treating relapsed AML. We also found
that LY2603618 sensitivity did not correlate with CHK1
transcript levels, which is in agreement with Bryant et al.
who found that CHK1 protein levels did not correlate
with CHK1 inhibitor V158411 sensitivity in leukemia,
lymphoma, and lung cancer cell lines [30]. Therefore,
CHK1 expression levels probably are not biomarkers
for predicting anti-tumor activities of CHK1 inhibitors.
Although ectopic overexpression of CHK1 in THP-1 AML
cell line had no impact on LY2603618 sensitivity, shRNA
knockdown of CHK1 in the cells resulted in significantly
increased sensitivity to the agent. These results suggest

LY2603618 enhances ABT-199-induced apoptosis
in AML cell lines
We and others have demonstrated that Mcl-1 plays
an important role in the antileukemic activity of the
Bcl-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 in AML and other
blood cancer cells [12, 16–18]. In our most recent study,
we demonstrated that induction of Mcl-1 represents an
intrinsic mechanism of resistance to ABT-199 in AML
cells [19]. Thus, combining LY2603618, which can cause
DNA damage and decreased expression of Mcl-1, with
ABT-199 may enhance its antileukemic activity in AML
cells. To investigate this, we treated the ABT-199 resistant
cell line U937 (a relatively resistant AML cell line with an
ABT-199 IC50 of 13.5 μM, as determined previously [12])
with LY2603618 and ABT-199 for 8 h. LY2603618 or

for cellular functions and anything above that threshold
seems unnecessary.
As expected, LY2603618 treatment of AML cells
caused DNA damage, along with decreased Mcl-1 protein

levels and apoptosis. Interestingly, our time course
experiment demonstrated that induction of DNA damage
and decrease of Mcl-1 protein occurred at the same time,

death is expected, decrease of Mcl-1 is an interesting
finding which may be useful for designing combinations
with CHK1 inhibitors. As one could expect, this property
of LY2603618 rendered its ability to overcome intrinsic
resistance to the Bcl-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199,
mediated by Mcl-1 in AML cells, leading to synergistic
antileukemic interactions between the two agents in
both AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples.
Although we found that overexpression of Mcl-1 only
partially inhibited LY2603618-induced apoptosis,
Nijhawan et al. revealed that overexpression of Mcl-1
inhibited UV-induced apoptosis [26]. This difference
may be due to the difference in the extent of Mcl-1
overexpression or could suggest that additional factors are
also involved in LY2603618-induced apoptosis.
A surprising finding of this study was that
LY2603618-induced DNA damage was enhanced by
ABT-199 in AML cells, which was potentially responsible
for the abolishment of ABT-199-induced increase of Mcl-1.
Though the exact mechanism by which ABT-199
treatment enhances DNA damage induced by LY2603618
remains unknown, Bcl-2 has been demonstrated to be
associated with numerous DDR proteins, such as APE1,
PARP1, Ku70 and BRCA1 (reviewed in [31]) , therefore
it is plausible that ABT-199 treatment inhibits or enhances
Bcl-2’s role in the DDR which can then increase CHK1
inhibitor-induced DNA damage. Studies are underway
investigating the molecular mechanism responsible for the
enhancement of ABT-199 on LY2603618-induced DNA
damage. However, this is not in the scope of this paper.
The CDK inhibitor Roscovitine partially inhibited
LY2603618-induced cell death, decrease of Mcl-1,
and DNA damage, suggesting that CDK-independent

mechanisms of DNA damage induced by LY2603618
treatment also contributed to cell death. As a central player
in the DDR, besides regulating the cell cycle checkpoints,
CHK1 also plays important roles in DNA repair and
stabilization of DNA replication forks [32, 33]. Thus,
targeting CHK1 with LY2603618 could inhibit CHK1’s
involvement in these biological processes, leading to DNA
damage independent of CDK activity.
Taken together, our results as well as those previously
reported by others, provide insight into the mechanism
of action for the synergistic antileukemic activity of
LY2603618 and ABT-199. Our proposed mechanism
is presented in Figure 7. LY2603618 treatment inhibits
CHK1 resulting in accumulation of DNA damage. DNA
damage decreases Mcl-1 protein levels, which decreases
its inhibitory effect on pro-apoptotic proteins, ultimately
resulting in the initiation of apoptosis. In ABT-199
resistant AML cells, ABT-199 treatment results in
increased Mcl-1 protein levels. However, when combined
with LY2603618, enhanced DNA damage occurs and
results in abolishment of the increase of Mcl-1 protein,
leading to synergistic induction of apoptosis. In summary,
LY2603618 enhances ABT-199 treatment in AML cells.
The toxicities in patients associated with either drug
have been reported [27, 34–37], and do not appear to
overlap. Further, the toxicities that are associated with
the individual treatments are manageable; suggesting
that combination therapy associated toxicities would be
manageable. Although our study used a limited number
of patient samples, and therefore may not necessarily
represent the full spectrum of AML, our data supports the
further development of CHK1 inhibition in combination
with ABT-199.

Figure 7: Proposed mechanism of action for LY2603618 alone or in combination with ABT-199 in AML cells. LY2603618
treatment inhibits CHK1, which results in CDK-dependent and CDK-independent DNA damage. DNA damage leads to a decrease of Mcl-1
protein levels and apoptosis. ABT-199 treatment in resistant cells leads to increased levels of Mcl-1 protein which can be abrogated
by combination with LY2603618 due to enhanced DNA damage induced by the combination of LY2603618 and ABT-199, resulting in
synergistic induction of apoptosis.

concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% growth compared
to vehicle control treated cells. The IC50 values for the cell
lines are presented as mean values ± standard errors from
at least three independent experiments. The IC50 values
for the patient samples are means of duplicates from one
experiment, due to limited sample. Patient samples for the
combined drug treatments were chosen solely based on
sample availability.

Drugs
LY2603618, Roscovitine, and ABT-199 were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX).

Cell culture
U937, THP-1, MV4-11, and HL60 cell lines were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). The CMY, CMS, and CTS cell lines
were gifts from Dr. A Fuse from the National Institute
of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. The CMK, NB4,
and OCI-AML3 cell lines were purchased from the
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
(DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). MOLM-13 cells were
purchased from AddexBio (San Diego, CA). The cell
lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (except OCI-AML3,
which was cultured in alpha-MEM) with 10–15% fetal
bovine serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY),
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin. All cells were cultured in a 37oC humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
Diagnostic AML blast samples derived from patients
either at initial diagnosis or at relapse were purified by
standard Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation, then
cultured in RPMI 1640 with 20% fetal bovine serum
supplemented with ITS solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) and 20% supernatant of the 5637
bladder cancer cell line (as a source of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor [12, 38, 39]).

Quantification of gene expression by real-time
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life
Technologies) and cDNAs were prepared from 2 µg total
RNA using random hexamer primers and a RT-PCR kit
(Life Technologies), and purified using the QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as previously
described [12, 42, 43]. CHK1 (Hs00967506_m1)
transcripts were quantitated using TaqMan probes (Life
Technologies) and a LightCycler® 480 real-time PCR
machine (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), based on
the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR data are
presented as means of duplicates from one experiment,
due to limited sample, and results were normalized to
GAPDH (4333764-1007034) transcripts. Fold changes
were calculated using the comparative Ct method [44].

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in the presence of protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Whole
cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Thermo
Fisher Inc., Rockford, IL) and immunoblotted with anti-pCDK1 (Y15) (9111), -CDK1 (9112), -p-CDC25C (S216)
(9528), -PARP (9542), -Bax (2774), -Bak (3814), -p-H3
(S10) (9701), -cleaved caspase-3 (9661), -Bcl-2 (2876),
-Bcl-xL (2764), -Mcl-1 (4572), -Bim (2819), -CHK1
(2345), -p-CHK1 (S345) (2341), -γH2AX (2577, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) or -β-actin
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described [45, 46].
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE,
USA), as described by the manufacturer. Western blots
were repeated at least three times and one representative
blot is shown.

Clinical samples
Diagnostic AML blast samples were obtained from
the First Hospital of Jilin University. Written informed
consent was provided according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. This study was approved and carried out in
accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Human
Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University.
Clinical samples were screened for gene mutations by
PCR amplification and automated DNA sequencing
and for fusion genes by real-time RT-PCR, as described
previously [12, 40].

In vitro cytotoxicity assays
In vitro cytotoxicities of the AML cells were
measured by using MTT (3-[4, 
5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide, Sigma-Aldrich), as
previously described [41, 42]. Briefly, the cells were treated
with variable concentrations of LY2603618, ABT-199,
or in combination for 72 hours. MTT was added to a
final concentration of 1 mM and cells were incubated for
4 hours at 37°C. The cells were lysed overnight using 10%
SDS in 10 mM HCl and plates were read at 590 nm using
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Apoptosis
AML cells were treated with LY2603618 and
Roscovitine, alone or in combination, or with LY and
ABT-199, alone or in combination, and subjected to flow
cytometry analysis to determine drug-induced apoptosis
using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/
propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis Kit (Beckman Coulter;

Oncotarget

Brea, CA, USA), as previously described [41, 43].
Apoptotic events are presented as percentage of
AnnexinV+/PI- and Annexin V+/PI+ ± s.e.m. Experiments
with AML cell lines were performed 3 independent
times in triplicates, while patient sample experiments
were performed once in triplicate due to limited sample.
Data are presented as mean ± standard errors from one
representative experiment. Patient samples were chosen
based on availability of adequate sample for the assay.
The extent and direction of antileukemic interaction
were determined by calculating the combination index
(CI) values using CompuSyn software (Combosyn
Inc., Paramus, NJ). CI < 1, CI = 1, and CI > 1 indicate
synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects, respectively
[41, 47].

BX-40 microscope equipped with a DP72 microscope
camera and Olympus cellSens Dimension software
(Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Approximately
50 comets per gel were scored using CometScore (TriTek
Corp, Sumerduck, VA). The median percent DNA in the
tail was calculated and graphed ± s.e.m.

Statistical analysis
Differences in cell apoptosis between treated
(individually or combined) and untreated cells were
compared using the pair-wise two-sample t-test. The
p value for the differences between LY IC50s for the groups
of patient samples was calculated using the Mann-Whitney
two-sample U test. The nonparametric Spearman rank
correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship
between LY IC50s and CHK1 transcript levels in the
primary AML patient samples. Statistical analyses were
performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0. Error bars represent
± s.e.m. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

Cell cycle progression
Cells were treated with the indicated drugs for up to
48 h. The cells were harvested and fixed with ice-cold 80%
(v/v) ethanol for 24 h. The cells were pelleted, washed with
PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/mL PI,
0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 1 μg/mL DNase-free RNase.
DNA content was determined by flow cytometry analysis
using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson),
as previously described [48]. Cell cycle analysis was
performed using ModFit LT 3.0 (Becton Dickinson).
Histograms were created using FlowJo v7.6.5 (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR, USA).
