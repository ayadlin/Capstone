BACKGROUND: The use of BRAF inhibitors may lead to the development of cutaneous toxicities such as rashes, photosensitivity, alopecia, palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia, and proliferative skin lesions, including keratoacanthomas (KAs) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCCs). The latter are noteworthy for their potential to exhibit malignant features, and
they may necessitate invasive treatment. Their prompt identification is of primary importance for directing supportive care
efforts and maintaining dose intensity while minimizing the morbidity associated with supportive care interventions.
Because such lesions are less familiar to oncologists, this study was designed to characterize their clinico-morphological
features, which have not been hitherto described. METHODS: The clinical and dermoscopic characteristics and risk factors of
new-onset proliferative skin lesions (benign verrucous lesions and KAs/cuSCCs) developing after the initiation of treatment with
vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and XL281 were analyzed; the histopathological diagnoses were ascertained. RESULTS: The majority of the
lesions were benign verrucous lesions (78%, n 5 87), whereas KAs/cuSCCs represented 22% (n 5 25). The median times to biopsy for
the initial verrucous lesions and KAs/cuSCCs were 4.8 and 10.5 weeks, respectively. The clinico-morphological features significant for
KAs/cuSCCs included a larger size (P <.001), a nodular appearance (P <.001), a central keratin plug (P <.001), a central ulceration or
crust (P 5.04), an adherent scale (P 5.02), an erythematous halo (P 5.03), and a scaly ring (collarette; P <.001) at the periphery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent the first detailed description of the clinico-morphological characteristics that permit distinction between the benign and malignant skin lesions induced by BRAF inhibitors. They are valuable for the recognition of lesions that

INTRODUCTION
Inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway have emerged as robust agents for
the management of tumors harboring the BRAF mutation.1 Selective inhibition of the mutant serine/threonine kinase BRAF by class I RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) in patients with advanced melanoma has
shown significant on-target clinical benefits. Vemurafenib, approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAF mutation, may reduce the risk of death by
30% in comparison with standard therapies.2,3 Dabrafenib was recently approved for use as a single agent and in
combination with trametinib for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E and BRAF V600E/
BRAF V600K mutations, respectively.4 XL281 (BMS-908662) has been evaluated in patients with advanced melanoma and metastatic colorectal cancer.5
The off-target activity of these novel drugs results in the development of various dermatologic adverse events:
rashes (64%-75%); photosensitivity (35%-63%); palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia (8%-60%); alopecia (29%-45%);
and proliferative skin lesions such as verrucous lesions/papillomas (30%-79%), keratoacanthomas (KAs; 5%-14%),
and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCCs; 23%-26%).6-9 Notably, these seem less prevalent with

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

We used an institutional review board–approved retrospective electronic medical chart review of patients
who had received a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib
[PLX4032], 960 mg; dabrafenib [GSK2118436],
150 mg; or XL281 [BMS-908662], 25-75 mg) and a
dermatologic consultation while they were participating in a clinical trial or an expanded access program
at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC). We identified patients with histopathologically diagnosed verrucous lesions and KAs/cuSCCs.
Because the dermoscopic characteristics of KAs and
cuSCCs overlap and do not permit differentiation12
and because they are treated in a similar fashion, we
pooled the data and analyzed the clinico-morphological features for differentiation from verrucous lesions.
The lesions were considered eligible for inclusion
when clinical and dermoscopic images were available
in our clinical image database. Two authors (A.C.R.
and N.J.) reviewed all images; the clinical characteristics, dermoscopic features, and histopathologic diagnoses were recorded.

dabrafenib when it is used as a single agent or in
combination with trametinib.6,10 Nevertheless, these
adverse events often mandate dose modifications and
necessitate referrals to specialists and thereby increase
treatment costs, impair patients’ health-related quality
of life, and result in additional morbidity. All of these
factors may negatively influence clinical outcomes.
Among the BRAF inhibition–induced adverse
events, proliferative skin lesions have received substantial
attention, although studies exclusively addressing their
clinicomorphological characteristics are limited.11
Knowledge of such features may aid in minimizing interventions, dose modifications, and unnecessary referrals.
In the current study, we aimed to characterize the distinguishing features of such lesions to improve the quality of
patient care.

We noted the cancer diagnosis; anticancer therapy dosing
details; and the morphology, location, timing, and any
prior history of such lesions. We also analyzed their dermoscopy images to improve characterization. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive, in vivo technique that permits a
better appreciation of surface/subsurface characteristics of
skin lesions.13 It is performed with a dermoscope (Fig. 1),
and it has been shown to improve the examiner’s diagnostic accuracy in addition to a clinical examination with the
unaided eye. In accordance with existing definitions (Table 1), specific structures such as keratin (white-to-yellow
masses, central plugs/ulcerations, crusts, domes, and
horns) and vascular structures, including thrombosed vessels, were identified. The most frequent and reproducible
structures were noted.
Histopathology

We retrieved the reports of all lesions subjected to histopathological examinations and recorded the diagnoses
(verrucous lesions/verrucal keratoses and KAs/cuSCCs).
Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.
Cross-sectional comparisons between the study groups
were completed with Pearson’s chi-square test for

nominally scaled variables and with the Student’s t test for
continuous variables. Significance was set at a < .05.
Logistic regression analysis, with an adjustment for clustering on the patient over a repeated measures analysis,
was used to identify risk factors for the development of
malignant lesions. The final variables were retained after
the application of the likelihood ratio test (P  .05 to
retain) in a backwards elimination process. Because of the
small sample size and the unknown nature of the sampling
distribution, nonparametric bootstrapping was used to
estimate the variance of the risk factors for malignant
lesions. Resampled data (1000 iterations) were used to
generate bootstrap estimates of the regression coefficients
of the multivariate model. All statistical tests were 2-sided.
Stata 12.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas) was used
for all analyses.

Eighty-seven of the 112 lesions were verrucous lesions,
and 25 were KAs/cuSCCs.
The median time to the initial biopsy of benign
verrucous lesions (from the initiation of the drug) was
4.8 weeks (range, 2.5-20.8 weeks), and it varied with
the drug (vemurafenib, 5.6 weeks [64 lesions]; dabrafenib, 3 weeks [11 lesions]; and XL281, 7.1 weeks
[12 lesions]); for KAs/cuSCCs, the median time was
10.5 weeks (range, 3.9-26.5 weeks), and it also varied
with the drug (vemurafenib, 11.5 weeks [22 lesions];
dabrafenib, 15 weeks [1 lesion]; and XL281, 3.9
weeks [2 lesions]).
Twenty-five patients had an underlying diagnosis of
metastatic melanoma, 6 had thyroid cancer, 1 patient had

RESULTS
Demographics and Time to Biopsy

We included 112 new-onset proliferative skin lesions
from 33 patients referred to the dermatology service of the
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for evaluation;
the lesions appeared after the initiation of treatment with
vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or XL281 (Table 2). The mean
age of the patients was 59.4 years (range, 41-80 years),
and a majority were male (76%, male/female ratio  3:1).
62

A majority of the KAs/cuSCCs were papules (64%) and
nodules (24%); the average size was 8.7 mm, and they
were located predominantly on the lower extremities
(48%) and scalp (20%). In contrast, verrucous (benign)
lesions were smaller papules (98%; average size, 5.2 mm)
distributed mainly on the trunk (30%), face (23%), and
upper (20%) and lower (15%) extremities (Table 3).

verrucous papules. Keratin domes or horns appeared
more commonly among verrucous lesions (13%) versus
KAs/cuSCCs (4%, P 5 .22).
An erythematous halo (52%) or a scaly ring/collarette (68%) was present around a majority of KAs/cuSCCs,
and they were present around 29% (P 5 .03) and 26%
(P < .001) of the verrucous lesions, respectively. Clinically visible thrombosed vessels were seen more commonly among the KAs/cuSCCs (68%, n 5 17) versus the
verrucous lesions (44%, n 5 38, P 5 .03). In the KAs/
cuSCCs, a majority of the thrombosed vessels were centrally located within the keratin plug, whereas in the verrucous lesions, they were either minimally scattered or
seen diffusely throughout the lesions.
As for keratin structures seen dermoscopically, keratin
pearls (white circles) were more commonly seen in the KA/
cuSCC group (24%, n 5 6) versus the verrucous lesion
group (4.5%, n 5 4). In addition, serpentine vessels, seen
dermoscopically, were more prominent in the KAs/cuSCCs
(28%, n 5 7) versus the verrucous lesions (2.3%, n 5 2).

a
All of the potential risk factors for malignant/benign skin lesions that were
available were assessed for inclusion in the logistic regression analysis.
These factors were sex, patient age, use of immunosuppressive drugs,
presence of comorbidities, history of KA/cuSCC, history of actinic keratosis, and anticancer drug use and dose. The variables listed are those that
were retained in the statistical analysis because they were significantly
associated with risk.
b
Point estimates and 95% CIs were determined by nonparametric bootstrapping. The final variables were retained after the application of the likelihood ratio test (P .05 to retain) in a backwards elimination process.
c
An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates an increased risk. An odds ratio
less than 1 indicates a reduced risk for developing benign skin lesions. The
reciprocal of the odds ratios indicates the risk of a benign skin lesion in
patients who do not possess that risk factor. For example, patients without
a positive history of KA/cuSCC would have a 6.2-fold risk (ie, 1/0.16) of
developing such a lesion in comparison with patients with a positive
history.

Clinical Features of Invasive cuSCC Lesions

Four lesions (2 papules and 2 nodules) in the KA/cuSCC
group were identified as invasive cuSCCs on histopathology. The average size of the lesions was 8.25 mm (range,
4-12 mm). Three lesions had adherent scale, and 2 had a
scaly ring and an erythematous halo at the periphery.
Three of the 4 lesions had a central keratin plug or central
ulceration or crust. Finally, 3 of the invasive cuSCCs had
thrombosed vessels located centrally.
Risk Factors Associated With the Development
of Proliferative Skin Lesions

Because of the observational nature of the study, no formal sample size or power analysis was undertaken. Therefore, the most relevant outcomes from the identification
of risk factors were 95% confidence intervals (CIs). P values should be viewed as being of secondary importance.
On the basis of our analysis (112 lesions in 33 patients),
64

the risk factors for the development of a malignant lesion
were a previous history of KA/cuSCC (odds ratio [OR],
6.1; 95% CI, 1.4-27.3), the use of vemurafenib versus
other agents (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.75-7.6), and an initial
cancer diagnosis of melanoma (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.1622.3; Table 4).
The risk factors for the development of benign
lesions were a negative history of KA/cuSCC (OR, 6.2;
95% CI, 1.28-29.5), the use of BRAF inhibitors other
than vemurafenib (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.73-7.9), and an
initial cancer diagnosis that was not melanoma (OR, 5.1;
95% CI, 1.10-23.4). Therefore, the risk factors for the development of benign disease were the opposite of those for
developing a malignant event.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified several clinico-morphological features that may facilitate the differentiation of
benign and malignant proliferative skin lesions
induced by BRAF inhibitors and aid in clinical judgment in daily oncology practice. The features significant for lesions with a malignant potential (KAs/
cuSCCs) include a larger size, a nodular appearance, a
central keratin plug, a central ulceration or crust, adherent scale, and, at the periphery, an erythematous
halo and a scaly ring (collarette; Fig. 2A-E).
A majority of our patients were treated for metastatic
melanoma, which is inherently more common in fairskinned individuals and especially those with a history of
excessive and long-term sun exposure. The latter inherently places the patient at risk for developing primary KA/
cuSCC, and this risk is further increased when the patient
is started on vemurafenib and/or has a previous history of
KA/cuSCC, as shown in our study (Table 4). This drugmediated action is thought to be the result of an upregulation of the MAPK pathway (phosphorylated Extracellular
signal-Regulated Kinase (pERK) signaling) in normal
cells (wild-type BRAF) upon RAF inhibition.14,15 It has
been reported that keratinocytes with RAS mutations
evolve into epithelial tumors16 and are predominantly of
the HRAS subtype in vemurafenib- and sorafenibinduced tumors.17,18 The incidence of such lesions may
vary, and the limited number of studies conducted so far
suggest that KAs/cuSCCs in vemurafenib- and
dabrafenib-treated patients occur in 4% to 31% and
<11%, respectively6,19 Similar estimates for verrucous
lesions are difficult to ascertain because the prevalence of
verrucae (human papilloma virus–induced) in the general
population is higher, and these lesions may go unnoticed
and/or unreported by clinicians.

We found that the verrucous lesions were biopsied
earlier than KAs/cuSCCs (median, 4.8 vs 10.5 weeks),
and this suggests that the former attain maturity at smaller
sizes when they are recognized, whereas the latter are suspected or may manifest when they attain a larger size. As
expected, in our sample, KAs/cuSCCs were larger at the
time of presentation in comparison with the verrucous
lesions (Fig. 2F-I). In a study published by Mattei et al,20
the time to the onset of KAs/cuSCCs was shorter in the
vemurafenib group. It appears that the onset happens
early after the initiation of the BRAF inhibitor (within 3
months) and then wanes. It is rare to develop new lesions
after 6 months (especially nevi and melanomas). Thus,
more frequent skin surveillance at the beginning of therapy may be warranted. On the other hand, it has been suggested that verrucous lesions may represent premalignant
lesions that may, if left long enough, develop into cuSCC
independently of size.11 Interestingly, patients who tend
to develop large numbers of verrucous lesions develop
cuSCCs concurrently. Therefore, lesions also need to be
constantly reassessed for evolution at each visit (Fig. 3).
The number of KA/cuSCC lesions that developed from
treatment with dabrafenib (n 5 1) or XL281 (n 5 2) was
lower, which makes it difficult to draw reasonable conclusions. In general, the early induction of skin cancers
(weeks) among these patients contrasts with those induced
by conventional immunosuppressive therapies (few
years).21
It is interesting that the majority of the KAs/cuSCCs
were noted on the lower extremities (48%) and scalp
(20%), with most being KAs or well-differentiated
cuSCCs with KA-like features. Although this predilection
for sun-exposed areas parallels the general trend independent of BRAF inhibition, intriguingly, lesions of the
face (typically the most common site) were rare (4%,
n 5 1).

Morphologically, benign filiform lesions were easily
recognizable and occurred exclusively among the verrucous lesions (Fig. 2G). The presence of keratin masses and
amorphous keratin structures was equivocal, but central
keratin plugs were more common in the KA/cuSCC
group; this was similar to such lesions (especially KAs)
outside BRAF inhibition.12 This feature is also one of the
criteria of a histopathological diagnosis, especially for
KAs. Although keratin domes or horns were not found to
be reliable features, keratin pearls (white circles) seen dermoscopically were indicative of a well-differentiated KA/
cuSCC.22 The presence of an erythematous halo or a scaly
ring around the lesions was significant for a KA/cuSCC
(Fig. 2B,E). This probably reflects inflammation, neoangiogenesis, and/or growth patterns, and biopsy should be
given prompt consideration. Lesions with clinically visible
thrombosed vessels, especially in a central location within
the keratin plug, may correspond to KA/cuSCC and mandate further investigation besides a specialist opinion.
This is particularly important because these features are a
clue to identify a KA/cuSCC and may reflect an invasive
lesion (confirmed histopathologically).
In general, it must be borne in mind that lesions
that are large (>5 mm), are ulcerated, are located in
sensitive sites (eg, eyelids, genitalia, or nails) or encountered in special populations (eg, children or patients
with dermatologic comorbidities), are treatmentresistant, or exhibit aggressive growth patterns require
an evaluation by a dermatologist (Fig. 3). Although it
has been suggested that KAs/cuSCCs may not necessitate dose modification, it is important to underscore
their early detection for satisfactory dermatologic surgery outcomes.

study, the disproportionate number of patients on each of
the drugs (in different phases of clinical trials), and the

requirement for clinical images constitute the limitations
of this study. Caution must be exercised when one is interpreting and generalizing our results. We did not assess the
sensitivity and specificity of the clinico-morphological
features, and we evaluated the lesions with prior knowledge of the histopathological diagnosis. In addition, interobserver variability was not studied. Lastly, the

significantly increase the diagnostic potential of those adept with the skill. It still needs to be determined what happens to these lesions (tumor course) upon cessation of
therapy (BRAF inhibitor) because regression is a wellrecognized feature of KAs outside BRAF inhibition.23
Future studies correlating the clinical features with dermoscopic imaging and histopathology, preexisting human

papilloma virus infections, human papilloma virus typing,
and lesion mutational status may significantly improve
our understanding of these lesions.
In conclusion, knowledge of the features described
herein may aid the nondermatologist in reliably recognizing
and appropriately triaging suspicious cutaneous lesions arising out of treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. Clinical monitoring, judicious dermatology referrals, and patient
education and counseling (i.e., skin protection and skin
self-examination) form the crux of management. With the
use of these drugs expanding, it is incumbent that oncologists gain familiarity with the management of such lesions
to ensure optimal clinical outcomes, maintain patients’
health-related quality of life, and curtail the costs of health
care.
