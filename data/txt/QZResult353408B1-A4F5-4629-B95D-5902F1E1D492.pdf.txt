ABSTRACT
Zoledronate is a standard treatment for preventing skeletal complications of
osteoporosis and some types of cancer associated with bone metastases, but we
little know whether the effect of zoledronate on metastasis of osteosarcoma. Here,
we investigated the inhibitory effects of zoledronate on cell viability, motility,
migration and invasion of 4 osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos2, MG-63, HOS and U2OS) by
affecting cell morphology, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cytoskeletal
organization as well as induction of E-cadherin and reduction of N-cadherin with
activation of transcription factors Slug and Twist, especially in U2OS cells. Zoledronate
decreased JNK and p38 phosphorylation and upper streams of focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) and Src to suppress the motility, invasiveness and migration of U2OS cells. In
addition to zoledronate-inhibited Rho A and Cdc42 membrane translocation and GTPg S
activities, the anti-metastatic effects in U2OS cells including inhibition of adhesion
were reversed by geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol. In conclusion, Zoledronate blocks
geranylgeranylation not farnesylation to suppress human osteosarcoma U2OS cellmatrix and cell-cell interactions, migration potential, the invasive activity, and the
adhesive ability by EMT via Rho A activation and FAK-inhibited JNK and p38 pathways.

Metastasis, including several events collectively
termed the invasion-metastasis cascade [4], results in the
detachment of tumor cells, motility, degradation of the
extracellular matrix (ECM), invasion, migration, adhesion
to endothelial cells, and the reestablishment of growth at
a distant site [5]. Initially, the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) combines loss of epithelial cell junction
proteins (e.g. E-cadherin) and the gain of mesenchymal
markers, such as N-cadherin and Vimentin [6], as well as
activation of transcription factors including Slug, Snail
and Twist [7]. Besides, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2
(gelatinase A, 72 kDa) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B, 92 kDa)

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma, the most common histological
form of primary bone cancer, consists of approximately
20% of all primary bone cancers [1, 2]. According to
the new chemotherapy protocols, surgical techniques,
and radiological staging, the combination of surgery and
chemotherapy has enabled promoted frequency of the
long-term survival to an approximate 68% in 2009 and
limbsparing surgery in the treatment of osteosarcoma [2,
3]. However, the metastatic ability of osteosarcoma is
accountable for poor prognoses and high mortality rates.

plays importantly in the process of tumor cell migration
and invasion [8].
Invasion of individual tumor cells can proceed
via the integrin-dependent (mesenchymal invasion) or
integrin-independent and Ras homolog gene family (Rho)/
Rho-associated protein kinase-dependent (amoeboid
invasion) mechanism [9]. Integrins, consisting of
α- and β-subunits and their receptors, are a family of
transmembrane glycoprotein adhesion receptors that
activate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, the first step
of metastasis [10]. Small Rho family GTPases control
multiple cellular functions such as adhesion, spreading,
migration, and division and are involved in all stages
during cancer progression [11]. Rho GTPase-dependent
regulation of cellular motility and migration is associated
with the control of dynamic reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton and the mediation of the formation of
specific actin structures [12]. Rho, member A (Rho A),
Rac-1, and Cdc42 are prototypical members of the Rho
family representing three canonical subgroups [11, 13].
Specifically, Cdc42 and Rac-1 revealed redundant effects
toward cell polarization and lamellipodium formation,
characteristic processes of mesenchymal motility [14].
Rho A, Cdc42, and Rac-1 shuttle between their inactive
GDP– and active GTP–bound forms to regulate the
dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, cell motility, cadherindependent adhesion, and cell proliferation [15, 16].
Malignant cells often decrease the levels of
E-cadherin, which is anchored to the cytoskeleton.
In particular, changes in the organization of the actin
cytoskeleton, which is implicated in adhesion-induced,
integrin-activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), lead to
remarkable changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of
several signaling proteins localized at the focal adhesion
complex [17]. FAK and the nonreceptor protein tyrosine
kinase Src connections forming a dual kinase complex
are important for the control of cell motility and invasion
[18]. In addition to regulating cell adhesion to the ECM
and proteolytic enzyme activities to basement membrane
degradation, integrins activate kinases to phosphorylate
cytoskeletal proteins and to manage stress-fiber formation,
cellular shape and migration [19]. E-cadherin–based
adherens junctions interact with catenins to modulate cellcell adhesion [20].
Zoledronate or zoledronic acid, a nitrogencontaining bisphosphonate, is the most potent member
in the bisphosphonate family as a standard treatment for
preventing skeletal complications of osteoporosis and
some types of cancer associated with bone metastases.
Apart from anti-metastatic potential, zoledronate has direct,
indirect or immune anti-tumor effects and blocks tumor
cell adhesion to make tumor cells more susceptible to the
cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy [21, 22]. The mechanism
comprises impairing migration and invasion, modulating
immune response and anti-angiogenesis effect, inhibiting
tumor proliferation, and inducing cell apoptosis [23].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Generally, zoledronate inhibits the formation of farnesyl
diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)
by suppressing FPP synthase and GGPP synthase [24].
This suppression results in the inhibition of prenylation of
small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rac because FFP and
GGPP are required for the posttranslational prenylation of
small signaling GTPase in transducing extracellular signal
for cell function such as cell proliferation, migration,
and invasion [25, 26]. Importantly, preclinical studies
reported that zoledronate may prevent lung metastases of
osteosarcoma in vivo [27-29], however, the anti-metastatic
effect of zoledronate in human osteosarcoma is few to
be investigated. Here, we proposed that zoledronate may
suppress osteosarcoma cells to exert anti-metastatic effects,
and further explored the underlying mechanisms involved.

RESULTS
Cytotoxicity of zoledronate in 4 osteosarcoma
cells
After 24 h treatment, 4 osteosarcoma (Saos2,
MG-63, HOS and U2OS) cells viability in the presence
of concentrations of 25, 50, 75 and 100 μM zoledronate
was not significantly different to that of controls (0 μM)
in the microculture tetrazolium assay (see Supplementary
Material online, Figure S1A). Thus, a 24 h treatment with
zoledronate up to 100 μM had no cytotoxic effect on 4
osteosarcoma cells. We used this concentration range for
zoledronate in all subsequent experiments to investigate its
anti-metastatic properties.

Zoledronate inhibits 4 osteosarcoma cells
motility, invasiveness and migration
In the wound-healing assay, zoledronate significantly
attenuated cell motility of 4 osteosarcoma cells both doseand time-dependently (Figure 1A). Also, both modified
Boyden chamber with or without Matrigel assays showed
that zoledronate significantly inhibited the migration
activity and invasive potential in 4 osteosarcoma cells
dose-dependently (Figure 1B). Taken together, zoledronate
seemed to be the most potent in U2OS cells.

Zoledronate has no effect on MMP-2
and MMP-9 of 4 osteosarcoma cells
In gelatin zymography, different concentrations of
25, 50, 75 and 100 μM of zoledronate did not show any
different effect to that of control on MMP-2 and MMP-9
levels in 4 osteosarcoma cells (Supplementary Material
online, Figure S1B). Similarly, no significant effects at
different concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μM of
zoledronate on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were
noted in western blotting analysis (Supplementary Material
online, Figure S1C).

morphology and EMT

therefore, we chose 50 μM zoledronate in all subsequent
experiments.
To explore whether zoledronate interferes with
EMT transcription factors (Slug, Snail and Twist) in
U2OS cells, western blotting analysis and RT-PCR were
used. We observed that zoledronate decreased protein
expressions and mRNA levels of Slug and Twist dosedependently, respectively, but did not affect the protein
expression and the m-RNA level of Snail (Figure 2D
& 2E). E-cadherin is regarded as a gatekeeper of the
epithelial state in various epithelial cell types, so we next
used siRNA directly against the E-cadherin expression
and found that it promoted U2OS cell migration but the

As shown in Figure 2A, 4 osteosarcoma cells
became shrunken after 50 μM zoledronate treatment.
Using western blot analysis, we found that zoledronate
increased the E-cadherin expression but attenuated the
N-cadherin expression in 4 osteosarcoma cells both in
dose- and time-dependent appearance (Figure 2B & 2C).
Again, zoledronate seemed to possess the most potency
of activating E-cadherin and suppressing N-cadherin
expressions in U2OS cells among 4 osteosarcoma
cell lines. For examining the underlying mechanisms,

effect was attenuated by zoledronate (Figure 2F). Using
immunofluorescence staining, the induction effect of

In the presence of 50 μM zoledronate for 6-8 hours,

in U2OS cells, while there was no obvious influence
of zoledronate on extracellular signal-regulated
protein kinase (ERK) and PI3K-Akt phosphorylation
(Figure 3A). Neither total ERK nor PI3K-Akt was
changed. These results suggested involvement of JNK
and p38 signal pathways in the effects of zoledronate
on U2OS cells. Using inhibitors of JNK (SP600125)

and p38 (SB202190), the induction of the E-cadherine
expression and inhibition of cell motility in the wound
healing assay by 50 μM zoledronate in U2OS cells was
further believed through down-regulation of JNK and
p38 phosphorylation (Figure 3B & 3C).

whereas there was no obvious influence in the presence of
exogenous 25 μM farnesol (FOH). To further investigate
the cytoskeletal organization of U2OS cells, F-actin
cytoskeletons were assessed by staining with Texas Red-X
phalloidin. After counterstaining with DAPI for nuclei,
U2OS cells became shrunken and F-actin fibers apparently
condensed upon 50 μM zoledronate treatment, comparing
with the control plate (Figure 4B). The inhibitory effects
of 50 μM zoledronate against motility, invasiveness and
migration in U2OS cells were also reversed by addition of
25 μM GGOH, but not by addition of 25 μM FOH (Figure
4C & 4D). These results suggested that zoledronate
attenuated cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, migration
potential, and invasive activity of U2OS cells by blocking
of geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation.
Furthermore, the effects of induction of E-cadherin
protein expression and mRNA level in western
blot analysis and RT-PCR, respectively, and that in
immunofluorescence staining by 50 μM zoledronate were
all reversed by addition of 25 μM GGOH, but not by
addition of 25 μM FOH (Figure 4E, 4F & 4G). Similarly,
both western blot analysis and immunofluorescence
staining showed that exogenous GGOH could reverse
the inhibitory effects of FAK and Src expressions as well
as JNK and p38 phosphorylation by 50 μM zoledronate
in U2OS cells but FOH could not. This indicated that
zoledronate blocked geranylgeranylation not farnesylation
to suppress FAK and Src expressions and JNK and p38
phosphorylation in U2OS cells (Figure 4H & 4I).

Zoledronate decreases t-FAK, p-FAK Tyr397,
p-FAK Tyr925 and Src expressions of U2OS cells
For better defining the role of zoledronate on upper
stream FAK family, western blot analysis was used and
showed that zoledronate significantly reduced t-FAK,
p-FAK Tyr397, p-FAK Tyr925 and Src expressions in
dose- and time-dependent appearance (Figure 3D & 3E).
Using immunofluorescence staining, we also observed the
effect of FAK reduction by 50 μM zoledronate in U2OS
cells (Figure 3F). Next, wild-type FAK (wt-FAK) was used
and showed that wt-FAK promoted U2OS cell migration
and reduced the E-cadherin expression and these effects
were attenuated by 50 μM zoledronate. (Figure 3G & 3H).

Geranylgeraniol (GGOH) reverses the antimetastatic effects of zoledronate in U2OS cells
As demonstrated in Figure 4A, the disturbance
of cell morphology in U2OS cells induced by 50 μM

restored in the presence of exogenous 25 μM GGOH,

GGOH reverses zoledronate-inhibited
membrane translocation and GTPγS of Rho A
and Cdc42 of U2OS cells

gene expressions. Hierarchical clustering was carried
out to illustrate the distinguishable gene expression
profiles between the 3 groups without, with 50 or 100
μM zoledronate treatments (Figure 6B). In hierarchical
clustering of gene profiles, zoledronate seemed to have
the inhibitory influence on expressions of α4-, α6- and
β1-integrins in U2OS cells. To validate the results of our
microarray analysis, RT-PCR was performed to confirm
the changes. U2OS cells were pre-treated with increasing
concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μM) of zoledronate
for 24 h and the inhibitory effects of α4-, α6- and β1integrins were all in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
6C). To further assess whether zoledronate decreases cell
adhesion to extracellular matrix components, U2OS cells
were pre-treated with or without 50 μM of zoledronate
prior to the adhesion assay on collagen type 1 (α2β1ligand), gelatin (heat-denatured collagen, α5β3-ligand),
or fibronectin (α5β1-ligand). Consequently, zoledronate
significantly impaired cell adhesion on collagen type 1 and
gelatin, but not on fibronectin in U2OS cells (Figure 6D).
Consistent with our previous findings, the zoledronateinhibited ant-adhesive abilities on collagen type I and
gelatin were reversed by addition of 25 μM GGOH, but
not by addition of 25 μM FOH.

Similar to induction of E-cadherin, 50 μM
zoledronate seemed to elevate Rho A and Cdc42
expressions in U2OS cells after 24 h treatment, but no
effect on Rac-1 and pan-Ras expressions (Figure 5A).
Actually, we could found that expressions of Rho A and
Cdc42 declined at 6 h treatment of 50 μM zoledronate in
U2OS cells. After 24 h treatment of 50 μM zoledronate
in U2OS cells, we further extracted cell membrane
proteins and analyzed Rho A and Cdc42 expressions in the
membrane and in the cytosol, respectively. Interestingly,
Rho A and Cdc42 expressions significantly showed
reduction in the cell membrane with the concomitant
increase in the cytosol, strongly implying Rho A and
Cdc42 translocation from the cell membrane to the cytosol
in response to zoledronate (50 μM, 24 h) (Figure 5B). Also,
this zoledronate-inhibited Rho A and Cdc42 membrane
translocation was reversed by addition of 25 μM GGOH,
but not by addition of 25 μM FOH, implicating the effect
specific to geranylgeranylation inhibition.
Moreover, 50 μM zoledronate markedly decreased
Rho A-GTPγS and Cdc42-GTPγS activities in the cell
membrane of U2OS cells and the inhibitory effect was
consistent with translocation from the cell membrane to
the cytosol. The effect was also restored by addition of
25 μM GGOH, but not by addition of 25 μM FOH, still
implicating the effect specific to geranylgeranylation
inhibition (Figure 5C). Using geranylgeranyltransferase
I (GGTase I) inhibitor GGTI-298 and farnesyltransferase
(FTase) inhibitor FTI-277 to block geranylgeranylation and
farnesylation, respectively, we interestingly observed that
10 μM GGTI-298 increased Rho A and Cdc 42 expressions
in U2OS cells, but not on Rac-1 and pan-Ras, mimicking
the effect of 50 μM zoledronate, whereas 10 μM FTI277 did not influence Rho A and Cdc 42 expressions.
This further indicated that the effect of zoledronate in
U2OS cells was through blocking geranylgeranylation
not farnesylation (Figure 5D). Additionally, siRNA
knockdown of either Rho A or Cdc42 diminished U2OS
cell migration and exaggerated the inhibitory effect of
cell migration by 50 μM zoledronate, further suggesting
that zoledronate decreased Rho A and Cdc42 activation to
suppress U2OS cell migration (Figure 5E & 5F).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, zoledronate at concentrations
without cytotoxicity (up to 100 μM) inhibited tumor
cell motility, invasion and migration in 4 osteosarcoma
cell lines (Saos2, MG-63, HOS and U2OS). Generally,
tumor cell invasion requires both cell migration and
digestion of the basement membrane by MMPs [6-8,
30], but zoledronate could not affect expressions and
m-RNA levels of MMP-2 and -9 in 4 osteosarcoma cell
lines. Zoledronate inhibited cell-matrix and cell-cell
interactions, migration potential, and the invasive activity
by induction of E-cadherin and reduction of N-cadherin
with activation of transcription factors Slug and Twist in 4
osteosarcoma cells, especially in U2OS cells and seemed
to possess the most potency in U2OS cells. Therefore, we
chose 50 μM zoledronate in all subsequent experiments
to examine the underlying mechanisms. We silenced
the E-cadherin protein using siRNA and observed that
it promoted U2OS cell migration and the effect was
attenuated by zoledronate, further indicating zoledronateinduced E-cadherin to suppress U2OS cell migration.
Src is capable of modulating cell migration and
invasion through interaction with integrins, the FAK, and
regulators of the family of Rho-GTPases [31]. Although
zoledronate inhibits prostate cancer proliferation through
ERK/Akt inactivation and synergizes with panobinostat
in prostate cancer and multiple myeloma models by
increasing ROS and modulating mevalonate and p38MAPK pathways, zoledronate inhibits the MAPK
and induced apoptosis of hepatoma cells [11, 32, 33].

GGOH reverses zoledronate-inhibited α4-,α6- and
β1-integrins and adhesion of U2OS cells
Using microarray analysis, the inhibitory effects of
zoledronate on clustering of gene profiles in U2OS cells is
shown in Figure 6A. Since integrins function as the major
cell receptor for extracellular matrix protein and integrin
binding genes showed significant inhibition by 100 μM
zoledronate, we subsequently analyzed the integrin family

However, we demonstrated that the anti-metastatic effect
of zoledronate in U2OS cells was through Rho A activation
and FAK-inhibited JNK and p38 pathways, but neither
total ERK nor PI3K-Akt influence. Indeed, zoledronate
interfered with cell morphology, EMT and cytoskeletal
organization in U2OS cells and blocked the enzyme of
geranylgeranylation not farnesylation of the mevalonate
pathway to suppress U2OS cell migration. We further
investigated that zoledronate caused accumulation of
Rho A and Cdc42 in the cytosol relative to the membrane
and also increased the total amount of cellular Rho A,
compatible with other reports describing up-regulation of
Rho-families GTPases following depletion of mevalonatederived isoprenoids [26, 34]. The addition of GGOH

but not FOH, prevented zoledronate-activated Rho A
and Cdc42 in total cell and the cytosol and zoledronatesuppressed Rho A- and Cdc42-GTPγS activities in the
cell membrane. The siRNA silencing of Rho A and Cdc42
declined U2OS cell migration and the effect was amplified
by zoledronate, further implying the decreasing Rho A and
Cdc42 activation in suppression of U2OS cell migration
(Figure 7).
Cancer cell adhesion is an important step of the
metastatic cascade that is essential for the cancer to
establish persistence at the site of metastasis, so impaired
the adhesive abilities of circulating cancer cells thereby
increases their metastatic potential. We actually found
that zoledronate significantly reduced mRNA expressions

of α4-, α6- and β1-integrins in U2OS cells. In agreement
with the previous results in the study, blockage of
geranylgeranylation but not farnesylation reversed the
zoledronate-inhibited adhesion to the collagen type 1
(α2β1-ligand) and gelatin (heat-denatured collagen, α5β3ligand) in U2OS cells.
The more potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
(such as alendronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate) induce
apoptosis in osteoclasts by inhibiting enzymes of the
mevalonate pathway, including GGPP and FPP synthase

[24]. The essential mevalonate pathway intermediate
isoprenoids (GGPP and FPP) are essential for the posttranslational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of
small GTPase, such as Rap, Rho and Ras [24]. Without
isoprenylation, specific proteins are unable to attach into
the membrane and do not function properly [35]. The Rho
proteins (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) are identified as tightly
regulated molecular switches that cycle between an inactive,
GDP-bound form and an active, GTP-bound form [12, 16,
36]. As previously reported [26, 34], and as in the study of

our findings, zoledronate inhibits U2OS cell migration by
decreasing Rho A and Cdc42 content and GTPγS activities
in the cell membrane and increasing cytosolic Rho A and
Cdc42 content.
Free nonsterol mevalonate pathway intermediates,
FOH and especially GGOH, are capable of salvaging
protein isoprenylation and, thus overcome statin and
apoptosis induced by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
in many cell types [24, 37-40]. For the correct function
of these proteins, prenylation is required because the
lipid prenyl group allows the anchorage of the proteins
in cell membranes and may also participate in proteinprotein interactions [41]. Accordingly, depletion of the
formation of essential mevalonate pathway intermediate
isoprenoids and the loss of prenylation of small GTPases
(preferentially geranylgeranylated) by nitrogen-containing
bisphosphonates could account for the various effects
observed on cancer cells like our findings in the study
through specific blockage of geranylgeranylation by
zoledronate in U2OS cells [40]. As evidenced by the
study, geranylgeranylation but not farnesylation, of these
small GTPases is required for their binding to the cellular
membrane in order to be active [42].
Many prenylated proteins are small G-proteins that
are integral components of various signal transduction
pathways in cancer cells. For example, farnesylation of

oncogenic Ras is essential for cancer transformation
[43]. Similarly, activation of the Rho family of
small G-proteins such as Rho A and Rac1 require
geranylgeranylation for their biological function, coupled
with activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway, leads to
oncogenic Ras transformation [44]. The overwhelming
evidence implicating the importance of activation of the
small G-proteins prompted us to further identify them
using the synthesized GGTase I and FTase inhibitors.
GGTI-298 and FTI-277 are CAAX peptidomimetics
that potently and selectively inhibit and GGTase I and
FTase to block geranylgeranylation and farnesylation
respectively [45]. Intriguingly, GGTI-298 mimicked
the effects of zoledronate, whereas FTI-277 had no
effects. This further indicated that zoledronate blocks
geranylgeranylation of small GTP-binding proteins via
inhibition of the GPP synthase not farnesylation via
inhibition of the FPP synthase in the mevalonate pathway,
which leads to a decline of Rho A and Cdc42 prenylation
and FAK-inhibited JNK and p38 pathways, to suppress
U2OS cells invasion and migration. The anti-metastatic
effects of zoledronate on U2OS cells are inhibited
by geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation, as
previously mentioned by others [40].
Integrins are believed to involve in various
intracellular pathways, including those involved in cell

Zoledronate blocks geranylgeranylation not farnesylation to suppress human osteosarcoma U2OS cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions,

adhesion, migration, polarity, survival, growth, and death,
suggesting their importance in cancer [46]. Expression of
the α6β4-integrin complex promotes tumor progression
and metastasis of various cancer cells, including breast,
colorectal, and thyroid carcinomas [47]. Increased
expression of α5-, β1- and β3-integrins correlating with
poor survival of patients with early non–small cell lung
cancer has been reported [48]. Importantly, β1-integrin
signaling has been shown to activate diversely in cancer
progression including invasion, migration and metastasis
[12]. Although anti-adhesive effects of zoledronate have
been described in breast cancer and human umbilical
vein endothelial cells [26, 49], the underlying molecular
mechanisms in osteosarcoma cells have not been studied
in detail. We investigated the effects of zoledronate on
α4-, α6- and β1-integrins reduction in U2OS cells and the
inhibition of cell adhesion to the collagen type 1 (α2β1ligand) and gelatin (heat-denatured collagen, α5β3-ligand)
in the context of mevalonate pathway suppressed by
inhibited geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation. In
combination with the previously described effects on
motility, migration and invasion by zoledronate, the antiadhesive abilities may add the influence on the distant
metastasis of U2OS cells negatively. Further validation of
the role of these genes and pathways is needed.
This study has several limitations. First, the
physiological relevance of the experimental concentrations
of zoledronate used in the in vitro study may not be
calculated accurately in vivo. Second, it is difficult to
detect the absorption, transportation and distribution of
zoledronate in various tissues of the body, especially the
levels of zoledronate in the osteosarcoma tissues clinically.
As prescribing information from Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation, East Hanover, NJ 07936, after intravenous
injection, approximately 22% zoledronate bound in human
plasma, independent of the concentration, but zoledronate
does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro and does
not undergo biotransformation in vivo. Third, zoledronate
may inhibit different pathways in various malignant
tumors and 4 osteosarcoma cell lines [11, 32, 33].
However, zoledronate is used widely for the treatment of
patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, patients with
multiple myeloma, and patients with documented bone
metastases from solid tumors. It is achievable for 50 μM
zoledronate clinically. Even more than the concentration
range exhibiting cytotoxicity, anti-tumor effects may
develop and provide a great benefit to the patient with
osteosarcoma despite anti-metastasis property [50].
Herein, we first clarify the importance of cell
morphology change, EMT and cytoskeletal rearrangement
in processes regulating cellular motility, migration and
invasion, and provide insight into the mechanism of
zoledronate-suppressed Rho A activation effect in U2OS
cells to inhibit JNK and p38 pathways. We identify the
temporal relationship of zoledronate-mediated Rho A
and Cdc42 content between translocation from cytosol
to membrane and small GTPase loading and the relative
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

importance of Rho and Cdc42 in regulating U2OS cellular
motility, migration and invasion. We further investigate
the zoledronate-suppressed adhesive activity on U2OS
cells by impairing α4-, α6- and β1-integrins expressions,
which may contribute the negative influence on distant
metastasis. Finally, we determine the anti-metastatic
effect of zoledronate on U2OS cells by blocking
geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation. Certainly,
our work reinforces the idea that zoledronate possesses
the anti-metastatic properties on osteosarcoma cells,
contributing to a better understanding of the mechanism
responsible for these effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and zoledronate treatment
The Saos2 (osteogenic sarcoma) cells (11-yr-old
Caucasian female), which were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM;
Invitrogen Corp., Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone Laboratories, Inc-Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin
(100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 μg/mL) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA). MG-63 cells (human, 14-yr-old male), which
were obtained from the Food Industry Research and
Development Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan), were cultured
in minimum essential medium (Gibco BRL, Grand
Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM
glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1.5 g/L sodium
bicarbonate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, and 1
mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). HOS
(human osteosarcoma; 13-yr-old female) cells, which
were obtained from the Food Industry Research and
Development Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan), were cultured
in Eagle’s MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 mL glutamine. U2OS
(osteogenic sarcoma; human, 15-yr-old female) cells,
which were obtained from the Food Industry Research and
Development Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan), were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and 5 mL glutamine. The cell culture
was maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 incubator. Zoledronate [2-(imidazol-l-yl)-1hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate] was provided by
Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland).

Microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay
For the cell viability experiment, a MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) colorimetric assay was performed to determine
the cytotoxicity of different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75,
and 100 μM) of zoledronate. After the exposure period,
the media were removed and the cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Afterwards, the medium
9754

mg/mL) for 4 h [5].

coverslips and grown for 16 h so that they attached to the
surface of the coverslips completely and 50 μM zoledronate
was added. Cells were grown at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2
for 24 h. After washing with PBS 3 times, cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution for 20 min and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min.
After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 5% bovine
serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Then the samples were
incubated with Texas Red-X phalloidin (200 U/ml) in 1%
bovine serum albumin in order to localize filamentous actin
(F-actin) for 1 h. For E-cadherin and FAK, the samples were
incubated with mouse-anti-E-cadherin (1:250) and mouseanti-FAK (1:500) at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, the
samples were washed with PBS and incubated with FITCconjugated mouse antibody for 1 h at 37°C. The nuclei were
counterstained with 4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
for 5 min. The coverslips were then washed extensively and
mounted on glass slides with mounting medium (DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark) for quantitative image analysis. The
image of samples coverslips were examined with Zeiss LSM
510 META confocal microscope. To examine whether the
farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins are involved in
the cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization disturbed
by the zoledronate, GGOH and FOH were added.

Wound healing assay
To study the possibility that zoledronate alters
motility of 4 osteosarcoma cells, we plated 9 × 105 Saos2
cells, 8 × 105 MG-63 cells, 1 × 106 HOS cells and 9 × 105
U2OS cells in 6-well plates for 16 h, wounded by scratching
with a pipette tip, then incubated with DMEM containing
0.5% FBS and treated with different concentrations (0, 25,
50, 75 and 100 μM) of zoledronate for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h.
Cells were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope
(×100) as described elsewhere [51, 52]. To examine
whether the farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins
are involved in the zoledronate-induced inhibition in vitro
wound closure, the mevalonate or the mevalonate-derived
isoprenoids were added, including GGOH and FOH.

Cell invasion and migration assays
To test the effect of zoledronate on the invasiveness
of 4 osteosarcoma cells in vitro, we used a modified
Boyden chamber invasion assay with Matrigel coating [5,
51, 52]. After treatment with the indicated concentrations
of zoledronate (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μM), 4 osteosarcoma
cells were seeded into the upper section of the Boyden
chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD, USA) at a density
of 4 × 104 cells per well, and then incubated for 24 h at 37
°C. Finally, they were counted under a light microscope.
Migration of cells treated with indicated concentrations
of zoledronate (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μM) was measured
as described in the cell invasion assay without Matrigel
coating [5, 51, 52]. To examine whether the farnesylated
and geranylgeranylated proteins are involved in the
zoledronate induced inhibition in cell invasion and
migration assays, GGOH and FOH were added.

Preparation of cell lysates and membrane
proteins and western blot analysis
To investigate the molecular mechanism further,
signaling pathways were detected using western blot
analysis. After treatment with different concentrations of
zoledronate (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μM) for 24 h, the
total cell lysates of 2.1 × 106 U2OS cells were prepared
as described elsewhere [5, 51, 52]. For extracting
membrane proteins from the cell lysate Mem-PER
eukaryotic membrane protein extraction reagent kit was
purchased from Thermo Scientific, IL, USA. Following the
manufacturer’s instructions, 3 × 106 U2OS cells after 24 h
treatment of 50 μM zoledronate were prepared to harvest.
Finally, the majority of membrane protein would be in
the lower hydrophobic fraction, which could be used for
membrane protein analysis. Conversely, the residue upper
hydrophilic fraction could be used for analysis of cytosolic
proteins. Samples including cell lysates, membrane
proteins and cytosolic protein extraction were incubated
with the primary antibodies, washed and monitored by
immunoblotting using specific secondary antibodies. To
examine whether the farnesylated and geranylgeranylated
proteins are involved in the protein expression disturbed by
the zoledronate, GGOH and FOH were added.

Gelatin zymography
To explore whether zoledronate suppresses MMP2 and MMP-9 activities in 4 osteosarcoma cells, gelatin
zymography was used. After plating 8 × 104 Saos2 cells, 8
× 104 MG-63 cells, 8 × 104 HOS cells, and 8 × 104 U2OS
cells in 24-well plates for 16 h, cells were treated with
different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μM) of
zoledronate for 24 h. Precast sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin were
prepared and electrophoresis was done, and then gels were
processed as described elsewhere [5, 51, 52].

Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Immunocytofluorescence
To determine the effect of zoledronate on cell
morphology, EMT and cytoskeletal organization, we utilized
the antibody-based immunofluorescence staining method.
U2OS cells (8 × 104 cells per well) were cultured on glass

Snail and Twist genes. For Slug, Snail, Twist and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
the following forward (F) primers, and reverse (R) primers
were used: Slug-F: gAgCATTTgCAgACAggTCA,

the farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins are
involved in the m-RNA level disturbed by the zoledronate,
GGOH and FOH were added, including GGOH and FOH.

Collagen, gelatin and fibronectin (0.1 μg/ml, 100
μL/well) were coated on 24-well plates at 37°C overnight
and then the wells were washed and blocked in 3% bovine
serum albumin. After treatment with or without 50 μM
of zoledronate, U2OS cells were detached from culture
by trypsin. Cells (1 ml; 1 × 105 cells) were added to the
wells and incubated at 37°C overnight. The adherent cells
were stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet in 25% methanol
for 30 minutes. Wells were then washed and dried and s
then olubilization of the Crystal Violet was performed with
0.1 M sodium citrate containing 50% ethanol. Absorbance
was measured at 590 nm (microplate reader, Bio-Tek
Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). To examine whether
the farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins are
involved in the m-RNA level disturbed by the zoledronate,
GGOH and FOH were added, including GGOH and FOH.

Interfering RNA
For silencing E-cadherin, Rho A and Cdc42 proteins
expression, small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibiting
human E-cadherin (s2770), Rho A (s759), Cdc42 (s55424)
and negative-control siRNA (4390844) were purchased
from Applied Biosystems Instruments (Foster City, CA,
USA). 2.1 × 106 U2OS cells were grown on 6 cm cell
culture dishes overnight. According to the manufacturer’s
instructions, a total of 30 pM of E-cadherin siRNA, Rho
A siRNA and Cdc42 siRNA were transfected into the
cells using lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The Silencer negative control
siRNA, a nonsense siRNA duplex, was used as a control.

Statistical analysis
For all of the measurements, analysis of variance
followed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni
test was used for more than two groups. Each experiment
was performed in triplicate and 3 independent experiments
were performed. p values < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
