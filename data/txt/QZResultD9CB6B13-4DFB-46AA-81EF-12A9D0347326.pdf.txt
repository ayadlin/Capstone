ABSTRACT
Cranberries are rich in bioactive constituents known to improve urinary tract
health and more recent evidence supports cranberries possess cancer inhibitory
properties. However, mechanisms of cancer inhibition by cranberries remain
to be elucidated, particularly in vivo. Properties of a purified cranberry-derived
proanthocyanidin extract (C-PAC) were investigated utilizing acid-sensitive and
acid-resistant human esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cell lines and esophageal
tumor xenografts in athymic NU/NU mice. C-PAC induced caspase-independent cell
death mainly via autophagy and low levels of apoptosis in acid-sensitive JHAD1 and
OE33 cells, but resulted in cellular necrosis in acid-resistant OE19 cells. Similarly,
C-PAC induced necrosis in JHAD1 cells pushed to acid-resistance via repeated
exposures to an acidified bile cocktail. C-PAC associated cell death involved PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inactivation, pro-apoptotic protein induction (BAX, BAK1, deamidated
BCL-xL, Cytochrome C, PARP), modulation of MAPKs (P-P38/P-JNK) and G2-M cell
cycle arrest in vitro. Importantly, oral delivery of C-PAC significantly inhibited OE19
tumor xenograft growth via modulation of AKT/mTOR/MAPK signaling and induction
of the autophagic form of LC3B supporting in vivo efficacy against EAC for the first
time. C-PAC is a potent inducer of EAC cell death and is efficacious in vivo at non-toxic
behaviorally achievable concentrations, holding promise for preventive or therapeutic
interventions in cohorts at increased risk for EAC, a rapidly rising and extremely
deadly malignancy.

INTRODUCTION

the rapid increase in EAC and the only known precursor
lesion, Barrett’s esophagus (BE), are still being unraveled.
However, persistent, symptomatic, reflux of gastric and
duodenal contents, known as gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD), have long been known to correlate with
the development of BE and EAC [4, 5]. Heartburn is the
primary symptom of GERD and is estimated to impact 60
million Americans [4]. In addition, obesity is reported to
impart a 2 to 2.5-fold increase risk for EAC and a 1.5 to
2-fold increase risk for GERD [5]. Thus, there is a large
population at elevated risk for BE and EAC, illustrating
the potential global health significance of this growing
problem. Other risk factors linked to the development of

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) rates have
increased over 500% during the last thirty years
identifying EAC as the major histologic subtype of
esophageal cancer and the fastest increasing of all cancer
types in the US [1, 2]. In 2015, 16,980 new incident cases
and 15,590 deaths due to esophageal cancer are estimated,
representing the 7th leading cause of cancer related deaths
among US males [3]. Mortality and incidence statistics
closely parallel one another reflecting poor survival due to
ineffective options for screening, prevention and treatment
coupled with late stage diagnosis. The precise reasons for

RESULTS

EAC include specific nutritional factors, overall dietary
patterns, animal-based diets and the presence of hiatal
hernia [6-8]. Plant-based diets rich in fruits, vegetables
and fiber have generally been associated with EAC risk
reduction [6] leading our laboratory to evaluate well
characterized purified plant-derived extracts as potential
inhibitors.
The urinary tract health benefits of cranberries are
attributable to the unique A-type linkages in cranberry
proanthocyanidins (C-PACs) which prevent adhesion of
p-fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli [9-14]. More recently,
cranberries have been reported to possess cancer inhibitory
properties based on a large number of in vitro studies
utilizing diverse cell lines of prostate, breast, cervical,
ovarian, oral, stomach, bladder, neuroblastoma, lung
and esophageal origin [15-23]. However, there is limited
mechanistic information regarding the ability of cranberry
constituents to inhibit cancers, especially in vivo. A
small number of xenograft studies delivering cranberry
extracts by intraperitoneal injections have shown positive
results, supporting that direct administration increases
tumor latency and inhibits growth of gastric, colon,
prostate, lymphoma and glioblastoma cancer cells [15,
21-23]. To our knowledge only two in vivo studies report
cancer-linked inhibitory effects following oral delivery
of cranberry products. Boateng et al. indicated that 20%
cranberry juice reduces azoxymethane-induced aberrant
crypt foci [24]; whereas, Prasain and colleagues reported
that cranberry juice inhibits nitrosamine-induced urinary
bladder cancer development by 38% [25], but lacked any
mechanistic explanation.
In this series of studies, we sought to investigate
mechanisms associated with the cancer inhibitory potential
of C-PAC, a well characterized proanthocyanidin-rich
cranberry extract, utilizing a panel of authenticated EAC
cell lines and conducting parallel molecular evaluations
in the first in vivo study focused on C-PAC inhibition of
EAC. Clinical and preclinical research efforts support
that alterations in the susceptibility to cell death underlie
neoplastic progression of Barrett’s to EAC. In addition,
acid refluxant is linked to alterations of inflammatory
molecules, NF-kB signaling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation
and MAPK signaling, ultimately resulting in an apoptosis
resistant phenotype [26-31]. Targeting these pathways
is logical for the prevention of esophageal cancer and
potentially other cancers in which inflammation and
aberrant cell death pathways provide a growth advantage
and support resistance to treatment.

C-PAC induced G2-M cell cycle arrest and cell
line specific S-phase delay accompanied by
morphological changes consistent with cell death
induction
We previously determined the IC50 of C-PAC to be
50-100 µg/ml based on WST-1 and BrdU in vitro assays
conducted in EAC (JHAD1 and OE19), lung (NCI-H460,
misidentified as SEG-1) and colon (SW460, misidentified
as BIC-1) cancer cell lines [16-18]. The latter two cell
lines were accepted to be EAC cell lines for decades, but
in 2010 DNA finger printing confirmed SEG-1 and BIC1 to be of lung and colon origin, respectively [32]. The
present study is the first to utilize authenticated human
EAC cell lines and EAC xenografts to investigate cancer
inhibitory mechanisms associated with C-PAC treatment.
As illustrated in Figure 1A-1D and Supplemental Figure
1S, flow cytometric results from PI staining alone showed
that C-PAC treatment of EAC cells resulted in a dose
and time-dependent effect on phase of cell cycle. C-PAC
[50 and 100 µg/ml] treatment of OE19 cells significantly
decreased the percentage of G1 cells and significantly
increased the percentage of cells at the G2-M checkpoint.
A similar significant pattern of reduced G1 and increased
accumulation of cells at G2-M was noted for C-PAC
treated OE33 and JHAD1 EAC cells (Supplemental Figure
1S). Additionally, C-PAC [50 and 100 µg/ml] treatment of
OE19 cell lines resulted in significantly increased S-phase
fraction based upon PI staining alone (Figure 1A and
1C); thus, PI in combination with S-phase specific BrdU
staining was conducted to assess S-phase distribution.
BrdU incorporation plots by treatment are shown in
Figure 1B for OE19 treated cells and Supplemental Figure
1S and Figure 1C for OE33 cells. Vehicle treated OE19
cells exhibited the highest intensity of BrdU staining
corresponding to the highest proliferative rates, 66.9%
compared to significantly reduced levels (14.4% and
0.4% BrdU) in OE19 cells treated with 50 and 100 µg/
ml C-PAC, respectively. C-PAC significantly inhibited
BrdU incorporation in a dose-responsive manner; slow
proliferating cells represented 9.4% of the S-phase fraction
in vehicle treated OE19 cells compared to 29% and 78%
in 50 and 100 µg/ml C-PAC treated cells, respectively.
Similarly, the percentage of OE33 cells in S-phase
were significantly reduced by C-PAC, but without an
S-phase delay (Supplemental Figure 1S and Figure 1C).
Furthermore, DNA histogram results (Figure 1C) revealed
that C-PAC induced a significant sub G1 peak (17.3%)
characteristic of late apoptosis compared to only 1.8% in
vehicle treated cells. Figure 1D depicts C-PAC induced
changes in EAC cell morphology and illustrates reduced
viability post-treatment as previously reported [18].

apoptosis was induced (12.3%, P<0.05). C-PAC [50 µg/
ml] significantly induced apoptosis and to a lesser extent
necrosis in OE33 cells at 24 and 48 hours post-treatment.
C-PAC [50 µg/ml] induced significant apoptosis in JHAD1
cells at 24 and 48 hours.
We evaluated how EAC cell lines responded to
a single 5 minute exposure to an acidified bile cocktail
(pH = 4). Figure 2E shows that JHAD1 and OE33 cells
were acid sensitive responding with rapid cell death (50
and 40%, respectively) 24 hours post-treatment. In sharp
contrast, bile cocktail treated OE19 cells did not result in
significant cell death induction, supporting inherent acid
resistance compared to JHAD1 and OE33 cells. Next,
JHAD1 and OE33 cells were repeatedly treated with the
acidified bile cocktail every other day for 7.5 minutes
mimicking multiple reflux episodes, as frequently occurs
in patients with GERD. Following the fifth treatment both
cell lines developed resistance based upon growth and
confluency compared to naïve cells. Subsequently, acid
sensitive or naïve JHAD1 cells and JHAD1 acid resistant
(AR) cells were treated with C-PAC and evaluated for

Characteristic features of cell death evident following
C-PAC treatment included nuclear fragmentation and
clumping, cellular blebbing, apoptotic residual bodies,
but also cytoplasmic swelling with intact membranes and
increased cytoplasmic vacuolization in JHAD1 and OE33,
leading us to evaluate autophagy linked cell death. Cellular
necrosis was evident given increasing concentrations of
C-PAC, particularly in OE19 cells.

induction via apoptosis and necrosis as summarized in

by tertiles to examine differences in proliferative potential. C-PAC reduced BrdU incorporation as indicated by compression of the Y-axis
intensity values (*P < 0.05). C-PAC treatment of OE33 cells did not result in an S-phase delay (Supplemental Figure 1S, A-C). C. C-PAC
treatment decreased cells in G1, increased cells in G2 and caused a significant increase on the sub-G1 peak indicative of late apoptosis. D.
C-PAC treatment altered EAC cellular morphology. Double arrows indicate formation of vacuoles and solid arrows show cytoplasmic
swelling with intact membranes associated with induction of autophagic vesicles; open arrowheads mark apoptotic cells. Cellular necrosis
is also evident (circled cells) given increasing concentrations of C-PAC, particularly in OE19 cells (All images, 400X).

C-PAC induced cell death effects in OE33 cells. E. Representative photomicrographs (400X) illustrates that a single exposure to an

minute acidified bile cocktail treatment naïve JHAD1 cells
experienced rapid and significant apoptosis. Early and late
apoptosis levels were significantly increased to 59.6 and
3.7% at 6hrs; 53.7 and 31.9% at 12 hours; and 66.2 and
23.2% at 24 hours, respectively (P < 0.05 compared to
vehicle treated cells). Conversely, when JHAD1-AR cells
were acid-pulsed cell death was not significantly induced
(Figure 2D); however, C-PAC treatment of JHAD1-AR
cells resulted in significantly increased cell death via late
apoptosis (12.6%) and to a greater magnitude cellular

death in constitutively acid resistant OE19 cells.

of C-PAC induced ultrastructural changes in OE19
and JHAD1 cells (Figure 3A). Vehicle treated cells
displayed normal morphology characterized by round
smoothly outlined appearing nuclei, normally distributed
heterochromatin, well defined plasma membrane and
preserved cytoplasmic organelles. In contrast, C-PAC
treated JHAD1 cells (Figure 3A, b-d) showed cytoplasmic
vacuolization and increased early (6 hours) formation of
double and single walled autophagic vesicles. Increased
autophagy continued in C-PAC treated JHAD1 cells
at 24 hours (f-h) with increased electron dense cargo
supporting formation of degradative autophagic vacuoles.
C-PAC treated OE19 cells exhibited features of cellular
necrosis as illustrated in j) and k) by moderate chromatin
clumping and nuclear disintegration, accompanied by loss
of plasma membrane integrity and marked loss of cellular

post C-PAC treatment of JHAD1 cells. Increased autophagy continues 24 hours following C-PAC treatment as displayed in f), g), and h)
with increased electron dense cargo supporting formation of degradative autophagic vacuoles. C-PAC treatment of OE19 cells induced

illustrates morphological changes of cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolization consistent with autophagy induction (as also noted in Figure
1D). Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and confocal microscopy were employed next to probe autophagic vacuoles in OE19, JHAD1
and OE33 cells following C-PAC treatment [50 µg/ml] for 24 hours. C-PAC treatment of OE33 cells resulted in increased accumulation of
punctate staining as illustrated in large MDC positive vesicles (far right, bottom panel). C. To further investigate C-PAC induced autophagy,
JHAD1, OE33 and OE19 cells were treated with C-PAC [50 µg/ml] or vehicle in triplicate and lysates collected at baseline and following
6, 24 and 48 hours of treatment; then, probed for LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta, an important early marker and
effector of autophagy. Representative images are shown, expression values were normalized to the loading control GAPDH and a mean
fold change from baseline or time of first detection calculated utilizing Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Positive fold
change values indicate increased expression and negative values reflect decreased expression. Figure 3C shows that C-PAC strongly (P <
0.05, t-test) induces the autophagy-associated lipidated form of LC3-II in JHAD1 and OE33 cells at 24 h and 48 hours; conversely, C-PAC
treatment of OE19 cells modestly increased the autophagic form of LC3 and non-lipidated LC3-I levels were not detected until 48 hours.

C-PAC treatment of JHAD1 and OE33 cells. JHAD1 cells
treated with C-PAC showed the formation of elongated
spindle shaped cells and increased cytoplasmic extensions,
early cytosolic vacuolization (enlarged inset), cytoplasmic
swelling, yet intact nuclei in subpopulations of cells.
The far right panel of Figure 3B shows a representative
MDC stained image of OE33 cells treated with vehicle
(top) and C-PAC [50 µg/ml] (bottom). Fluorescent MDC
staining shifted from a generalized weak and diffuse
pattern in vehicle treated cells to a pattern of significant
cell enlargement and markedly increased accumulation
of intense punctate MDC positive vesicles 24 hours post
C-PAC treatment [50 µg/ml] consistent with autophagy
induction. A similar pattern was noted in JHAD1 cells,
but not OE19 cells (data not shown).
To further investigate C-PAC induced autophagy,
JHAD1, OE33 and OE19 cells were treated with C-PAC
[50 µg/ml] or vehicle and lysates collected at baseline and
following 6, 24 and 48 hours of treatment; then, probed for
LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta,
an important early marker and effector of autophagy. LC3
is modified via an ubiquitylation-like system generating
a soluble form, LC3-I, which in turn is modified during
autophagy induction to a membrane-bound form, LC3II. Starting at 6 hours, C-PAC strongly induced the
autophagy-associated lipidated form of LC3-II in JHAD1
and OE33 cells (Figure 3C P < 0.05, t-test) with increased
magnitude at 24 and 48 hours (2.5 to 5.1-fold) supporting
early autophagosome formation. Conversely, C-PAC
treated OE19 cells modestly increased the autophagic
form of LC3 (1.6 to 2.0 fold, P < 0.05) and non-lipidated
LC3-I levels were not detected until 48 hours suggesting
altered autophagy machinery and differing constitutive
expression levels across EAC cell lines.

regulates both the G1-S and G2-M checkpoints, whereas
Cyclin B1 is a regulator of mitosis. Cyclin A1 levels
were essentially unchanged in C-PAC treated JHAD1
cells; markedly reduced in OE33 cells (1.5-fold and 4.7fold at 24 and 48 hours); and in OE19 cells, levels were
transiently decreased followed by a 1.4-fold increase at
48 hours. Levels of cyclin B1 were increased in JHAD1
C-PAC treated cells (1.9-fold, 48 hours); whereas, levels
declined to undetectable in OE33 cells following C-PAC
treatment (24 and 48 hours). Cyclin B1 levels were not
detected in OE19 cells at baseline or following treatment.
C-PAC treatment increased expression levels of the
tumor suppressor, P16 in a time-dependent manner in
only OE33 cells (1.4 fold at 6 and 24 hours, 2.0 fold at
48 hours) which is promising considering its linkage to
EAC progression. Levels of P16 were unchanged in OE19
cells and undetectable in JHAD1 cells where it is known
to be deleted. Next, P21 was evaluated given its role in
diverse cell cycle regulatory function at both G1 and G2-M
checkpoints. Although basal levels of P21 were low in all
EAC cell lines, C-PAC treatment increased levels showing
an early, but transient 4.0-fold level increase in JHAD1
cells and increased levels in OE19 cells at 6 and 24 hours.
Whereas, OE33 cells showed the highest magnitude and
sustained increase in P21, changing from non-detectable
levels at baseline to 1.7- and 2.3-fold increased levels
at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Also linked with p21
and cell cycle regulation is the critical tumor suppressor
protein P53 which is inactivated early, frequently and
linked to poor prognosis for EAC [33, 34] and is now
known to be mutated in all three EAC cell lines evaluated
[35]. JHAD1 cells expressed P53 in all forms and C-PAC
induced a 2-fold increase in pro-apoptotic P-p53ser46 and
an increase in P-p53ser15 at 6 hours; whereas, in OE19
cells C-PAC induced strong expression of only P-p53ser15
which is linked to DNA damage induced cell death.
JHAD1 cells reportedly have a somatic mutation in exon
8 resulting in a non-synonymous Gly 266 Glu alteration
[36]. Still, in JHAD1 cells, C-PAC induced cell death
may be partially p53-mediated as the p53 target BAX
is also up-regulated (1.4 fold, 48 hours). OE19 cells are
reported to have partially functional p53, despite showing
a total lack of P53 expression and very low P-P53ser46
expression. OE33 cells have a p53 mutation in exon 5,
resulting in non-functional nuclear protein accumulation
and weak expression of P-P53ser46. The p53 homolog p73,
known to mediate apoptosis and autophagy via the mTOR
pathway [36, 38] was also evaluated. C-PAC treatment
resulted in a consistent temporal increase (6-48 hours)
in P73 expression levels in OE19 and JHAD1 cells, but
P73 levels in C-PAC treated OE33 cells were unchanged
followed by a reduction at 48 hours.

JHAD1, OE33 and OE19 were treated with C-PAC

48 hours. As shown in Figure 4A-4E, EAC cell lines were
assessed for temporal changes in the expression of proteins
involved in cell cycle (Cyclin A1, Cyclin B1, P16, P21),
P53 signaling (P53, P73, P-P53 at SER46 and SER15),
kinase signaling (P-JNK, P-ERK, P-P38), PI3K/AKT/

normalized to the appropriate loading control and a foldchange from baseline or first detection calculated.

of interest. Expression values were normalized to the appropriate loading control, GAPDH or HSP60, and a fold change from baseline or

migration and death [39]. MAPKs are comprised of
extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun
N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs, each of
which we evaluated in EAC cells following C-PAC
treatment (Figure 4C). JNK phosphorylation was generally
increased in EAC cells by C-PAC treatment; however,
the level, temporality and magnitude differed across
cell lines. More striking expression changes were noted
in both P-ERK1 (44 kD) and P-ERK2 (42 kD). C-PAC
treated JHAD1 cells showed increased P-ERK1/2 levels
at 6h (1.5/1.3-fold, respectively). In contrast, P-ERK1/2
declined in a temporal manner in treated OE19 cells
starting at 6 hours, with greatest effects at 48 hours. In
OE33 cells, C-PAC treatment decreased levels of P-ERK1
at 6 and 24 hours (1.2 and 1.7-fold) followed by 2.1-fold
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increased P-ERK2 levels at 48 hours. C-PAC increased
levels of P-p38, a marker generally thought to have a
tumor suppressive role. JHAD1 cells showed a biphasic
change in P-p38 in response to treatment (1.6, 1.2-and 2.0fold increased levels at 6, 24 and 48 hours, respectively).
P-p38 levels were strongly expressed in OE33 cells and
increased in a time-dependent manner from 1.5-fold at 6
hours to 1.7-fold at 48 hours. Treated OE19 cells showed
increased (1.6-fold) P-p38 at 6 hours, followed by gradual
reductions through 48 hours. Our data support differential
activation of MAPK molecules by C-PAC temporally and
in a cell-line specific manner.
Considering C-PACs ability to induce apoptosis,
autophagy and necrosis, a host of key cell death signaling
molecules were evaluated. PARP cleavage is considered
a hallmark of apoptosis induction, but is also implicated

in DNA repair and DNA-damage induced autophagy
[40-42]. All EAC cell lines showed a time-dependent
increase in PARP cleavage after C-PAC treatment, with
the strongest and earliest induction noted in OE19 cells
(Figure 4D). However, C-PAC treatment failed to activate

effector caspase 7 in EAC cells (Supplemental Figure
2S) and caspase 3 cleavage was weak, only detected with
extended exposure times. In addition, C-PAC had little
effect on initiator caspases 8 or 9 or caspase 4, involved
in inflammatory cytokine processing. C-PAC induced

expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 members, BAX and
BAK in JHAD1 cells (48 h) and increased BAK in OE33
cells (48 h). Additionally, the phosphorylated form of
BCL2, which acts to suppress the anti-apoptotic effects
of BCL2, was modestly elevated only in OE19 cells at 24
and 48h (data not shown), but not detectable in JHAD1
or OE33 cells. C-PAC treatment increased levels of the
pro-apoptotic deamidated form of BCL-xL [43, 44], in
a time-dependent manner as indicated by the percentage
comprising the upper band of BCL-xL (Figure 4D), in
both JHAD1 (40.6-70.5%) and OE33 (14.4-66.9%) cells.
In contrast, OE19 cells showed increased expression of
deamidated BCL-xL, but the magnitude was much lower
(17.3-21.3%) supporting greater resistance.
As shown in Figure 4E, C-PAC treatment strongly
inactivated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling networks
as supported by total loss or significant reduction of
P-p70S6k, P-AktThr308 and P-AktSer473 expression in all
EAC cell lines 24 and 48 hours post C-PAC treatment.
mTOR levels also decreased following C-PAC treatment.
Collectively, the results support C-PAC inhibition of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. P-pTEN was evaluated
given its role in the regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling and
autophagy induction. C-PAC markedly reduced levels of
P-pTEN at 24 and 48 hours (1.6 and 2.4-fold, respectively)
in OE33 cells; resulted in minor reductions in OE19 cells,
but had little impact in JHAD1 cells indicating a cell line
specific effect between pTEN dephosphorylation and AKT

inactivation.

C-PAC inhibited growth of OE19 tumor
xenografts by modulation of cell cycle, PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways
On the basis of our positive in vitro results
supporting C-PAC has cancer inhibitory potential in
EAC cells; we next evaluated the in vivo tumor inhibitory
potential of C-PAC utilizing OE19 xenografts in an
athymic NU/NU mouse model. Unlike OE33 and JHAD1
cells, OE19 cells readily formed xenograft tumors
reaching 150 mm3 5 days post-injection of 1.25E6 OE19
cells per flank. On day 5, mice were randomized to receive
vehicle or C-PAC [250 µg/day] via gavage 6 x weekly.
Figure 5A-5D summarizes C-PACs effects on OE19
tumor growth, tumor morphology and alterations in the
expression levels of cell cycle, proliferative, apoptotic, and
AKT/mTOR/MAPK signaling proteins. C-PAC treatment
did not alter body weight or food consumption (data not
shown) in treated mice. Orally delivered C-PAC [250 µg/
day] resulted in a significant, 67.6%, decrease in xenograft
tumor volume. Figure 5B, illustrates that vehicle treated
tumors had increased blood vessel formation as evidenced
by areas of bright eosinophilia (black arrows). Whereas,
C-PAC treated xenografts (C) displayed large areas of
relatively normal epithelium mixed with focal glandular

Figure 6: Proposed model for C-PAC induced cell death in EAC cell lines. Results support C-PAC induces cell death by
different mechanisms in EAC cell lines based on sensitivity to an acidified bile mixture. Exposing acid sensitive JHAD1 and OE33 EAC
cells to an acidified bile cocktail (5 min, pH = 4.0) resulted in rapid cell death via early apoptosis; however, exposure of inherently acid
resistant OE19 EAC cells does not result in significant cell death. C-PAC treatment of JHAD1 and OE33 cells results in cell death via low
levels of apoptosis and significant autophagy; whereas C-PAC treated OE19 cells die largely by cellular necrosis and exhibit low levels of
autophagy and apoptosis. Similarly, when JHAD1 cells are pushed to become resistant to the acidified bile cocktail (4-6 repeat exposures)
the cells die via necrosis supporting that mode of cell death induction is linked to sensitivity to an acidified bile cocktail.

precursor lesions. Lysates isolated from C-PAC treated
OE19 xenografts (D) showed decreased expression in
the proliferative marker PCNA and to a greater extent
cyclin A; cyclin B1 was not detected (data not shown).
C-PAC treatment resulted in increased levels of proapoptotic cytochrome C (1.4-fold) and reduced P-ERK
levels in C-PAC treated tumors, in line with decreased
levels detected in C-PAC treated OE19 cells. C-PAC
treatment also induced dephosphorylation of p70S6K,
AKTThr308, and reduced P-AKTSer473 paralleling in vitro
results. Lastly, C-PAC induced expression of autophagy
associated LC3B-II in OE19 xenografts, but not Beclin-1
levels. Neither P-pTen nor activated caspases (3, 7 or 9)
were detected in C-PAC treated xenograft lysates.

from C-PAC treated mice include increased levels of
pro-death BAX and Cytochrome C, reduced Cyclin A
and PCNA, as well as reduced P-ERK1/2 supporting
additional effects on MAPK signaling networks.
Fitzgerald and colleagues identified the MAPK pathway
to be highly induced (42.7%) following receptor tyrosine
kinase activation (RTK) in esophago-gastric tumors [48].
Importantly, bile and/or acid exposure, well-documented
risk factors for EAC, are linked to aberrant MAPK
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling [26-32, 48]. Also
downstream of RTK activation is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway regulating diverse cellular functions involved in
EAC cancer progression including advanced tumor stage,
poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance [49-53]. Hence,
results are promising in that C-PAC mitigates aberrant
PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling cascades in vivo
and in vitro. Moreover, in vitro findings support that the
mode of C-PAC induced cell death varies based on acid
resistance of the EAC cells. C-PAC induced cell death
via low levels of mainly caspase independent apoptosis
and significant autophagy in acid-sensitive JHAD1 and
OE33 EAC cells, but mainly through cellular necrosis in
OE19 cells which exhibited greater constitutive resistance
to acidified bile salt exposure, as well as resistance to
apoptosis and autophagy induction, as summarized in
Figure 6. The role of autophagy in EAC and BE is a
poorly understood and understudied area to date. Dvorak
and colleagues recently reported a significant decrease
in expression of Beclin-1, a key autophagy regulator, in
dysplastic BE and EAC cases compared to non-dysplastic
BE tissues and normal squamous epithelium [54].
Interestingly, acute bile acid exposure increases Beclin-1
levels inducing autophagy; whereas, chronic or longterm bile acid exposure leads to a reduction in Beclin-1
expression and inhibition of autophagy [54]. Our results
lend further support to autophagy induction as a pro-death
mechanism in EAC, particularly in apoptosis resistant
cells. Beclin-1 expression is linked to improved survival
in patients with squamous cell cancer of the esophagus
[55], but additional autophagy research is warranted in the
context of EAC disease progression and prognosis given
clinical interest in both autophagy inhibitors and inducers
as therapeutic agents.
Cell line specific responses following C-PAC
treatment were noted for select cell cycle and cell death
associated markers; yet, common biological responses
included G2-M cell cycle arrest. The strongest effects of
C-PAC induced G2-M arrest were noted in OE33 cells,
followed by OE19 and significant, but modest effects
in JHAD1 cells. Cyclin A1 regulates both the G1-S and
G2-M checkpoints, correlates with degree of dysplasia
in BE patients and is linked to cancer invasiveness [52,
53]. Cyclin A1 levels were essentially unchanged in
C-PAC treated JHAD1 cells, markedly reduced in OE33
cells (4.7-fold), transiently decreased in OE19 cells (1.2fold), and markedly reduced (3.5-fold) in C-PAC treated

DISCUSSION
Esophageal adenocarcinoma represents a significant
health problem characterized by rapidly rising incidence,
substantial morbidity and high mortality. Barrett’s
esophagus is the only recognized precursor lesion and
although BE patients are successfully treated to relieve
symptoms associated with acid reflux, none of the
current therapies have proven inhibitory against EAC
development. Considering the majority of BE patients
are relatively healthy and do not progress to EAC [45]
identification of non-toxic cancer inhibitory agents,
acceptable for long-term administration, are needed. A
number of bioactive constituents derived from plant or
food-based sources have favorable toxicity profiles and
hold promise as cancer inhibitors. Cranberry constituents
have been shown to have strong anti-proliferative and
apoptosis inducing capacity in a number of cancer cell
lines and in a limited number of in vivo models [1525]; however, pathways of inhibition are incompletely
understood. Thus, the current study evaluated C-PAC
induced EAC cell death mechanisms in vitro and in vivo
to improve our understanding of targetable molecular
pathways and the context in which EAC inhibition is
permissive.
Results of the current study demonstrated that
C-PAC has potent EAC cell death inducing capacity
and strongly inhibits growth of EAC tumor xenografts.
The research results presented appear to be the first to
demonstrate C-PAC induced autophagy resulting in
cancer cell death and the first to report in vivo efficacy of
orally delivered C-PAC against EAC. Oral administration
of C-PAC resulted in significantly reduced (68%) OE19
xenograft volume linked to markedly increased formation
of autophagic LC3B-II and inactivation of PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling as evidenced by dephosphorylation
of p70S6K, AKTSer473 and to a lesser extent AKTThr308.
Interestingly, autophagy induction in vitro and in vivo
appeared to be Beclin-1 independent; also, reported
to occur with treatment of resveratrol [46] and cisunsaturated fatty acids [47]. Other effects noted in lysates

xenografts. Cyclin B1, charged with transitioning cells
from G2 to M, was not detected in OE19 cells; whereas,
levels decreased 24 hours post-treatment in OE33 cells
to below detection limits as is commonly reported with
G2-M arrest and more specifically late G2 arrest. In
contrast, C-PAC treated JHAD1 cells displayed increased
Cyclin B1 levels (1.9-fold) suggesting M-phase arrest
and potentially mitotic catastrophe resulting from DNA
damage. DNA damage induced MAPK activation also
contributes to p21 induction and cell cycle arrest. P21
is known to be involved in diverse cell cycle regulatory
functions at both G1 and G2-M checkpoints. Interestingly,
OE33 cells showed the highest magnitude and sustained
increase in P21, changing from non-detectable at baseline
to 2.3-fold increased levels at 48 hours. The latter finding
is potentially linked to the fact that p21 levels peak during
G2 and that C-PAC induced the highest magnitude of G2-M
arrest in OE33 cells.
In terms of cell death associated molecules, C-PAC
treated EAC cells responded with increased cleaved PARP
and cytochrome C levels, but effects were generally
caspase independent, with only low level induction of
activated caspase 3 (Supplemental Figure 2S). Caspaseindependent PARP cleavage can lead to apoptotic or
necrotic cell death and our data suggests a role for
autophagy induction as well. A novel unexpected finding
was that C-PAC induced deamidation of BCL-xL, a prodeath form of the important pro-survival BCL-2 family
member protein and one whose functional consequences
are still being unraveled [43, 44, 56]. However, recent
research suggests factors decreasing BCL-xL deamidation
may increase tumor cell viability and increase resistance
to cancer treatment [56]. In brief, Weintraub and
colleagues revealed that DNA damaging agents induce
BCL-xL deamidation of two asparagines by disrupting
the capacity of BCL-xL to inhibit the proapoptotic
activity of BH3 domain-only proteins; in turn, increasing
apoptosis susceptibility [42]. Results herein suggest the
first time that BCL-xL deamidation may also play a role
in autophagy induction in apoptotic resistant EAC cells.
Our data provide novel insight into mechanisms of
C-PAC induced cell death in vitro and in vivo providing
the first evidence that C-PAC activated autophagy serves
as an alternative cell death pathway in apoptotic and acid
resistant EAC cancer cells; yet, C-PAC targeted necrosis
in apoptosis and autophagy resistant cells. C-PACs
pro-death effects were accompanied by inactivation of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, modulation of MAPKs
and a G2-M cell cycle arrest. Still, additional research is
warranted to assess the effects of C-PAC on mitophagy
and chaperone-mediated autophagy as well as ROS
generation and DNA damage. The current study results lay
the foundation and direction for future research utilizing
genetic and pharmacologic approaches to further improve
our understanding of C-PACs potential to target EAC or
Barrett’s esophagus. Additional research is ongoing to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

assess the effects of C-PAC utilizing normal esophageal
cells and a panel of premalignant BE cell lines, as well
as a rat model in which reflux-inducing surgery results
in EAC. Future in vivo research should also consider
evaluations of primary esophageal xenografts which have
the advantage of preserving cancer stem cell populations,
stromal components and greater functional characteristics
of the primary cancer [57] and in turn may offer improved
personalized preventive or therapeutic approaches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cranberry extract isolation, purification and dose
determination
Cranberry fruit (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.)
was collected at the Marucci Center for Blueberry and
Cranberry Research, Chatsworth, NJ. Purified C-PAC
extract was isolated from cranberries of the ‘Early Black’
cultivar utilizing solid-phase chromatography according
to well established methodology [9-12]. In brief, the
fruit was homogenized in 70% aqueous acetone, filtered
and the pulp discarded. Collected cranberry-derived
proanthocyanidins were concentrated under reduced
pressure and purified extract isolated using bioassaydirected fractionation. The absence of absorption at
360 nm and 450 nm confirm all but proanthocyanidins
are removed. Additional methods including 13C NMR,
electrospray mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry,
and acid catalyzed degradation with phloroglucinol were
utilized to verify the presence of A-type linkages as well
as to determine the concentration of proanthocyanidins
in the purified extract. C-PAC is comprised of five
main proanthocyanidins as previously characterized by
Dr. Howell and colleagues [11]. The proanthocyanidin
molecules largely consist of epicatechin units with degrees
of polymerization of 4 or 5, as well as epigallocatechin
and catechin. C-PAC contains three types of linkages, two
common B-type linkages (C4→C6 and C4→C8) and at
least one unique A-type ether linkage (C2→O→C7) found
only in cranberry, chokeberry, plums and avocado [14,
15]. Purified C-PAC was freeze-dried and stored at -80°C.
C-PAC concentrations chosen for study were informed by
our earlier research which determined the LD50 to be in
the 50 to 100 μg/ml range in various cancer cell lines [1618]. Consideration was also given to earlier evaluations
by Howell and colleagues showing 50 μg/ml of C-PAC
inhibits adhesion of p-fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli
bacteria in vitro and that 36 mg/day of C-PAC delivered
in 10 ounces of juice inhibits bacterial adhesion in the
urinary tract wall of humans [9-13]. Importantly, the
concentrations of C-PAC under evaluation in this series of
preclinical investigations are readily achievable in humans

hours post-treatment. Cell lysates were prepared using
Cell Signaling lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc., Beverly, MA.). Protein was quantified using the
Quick Start Bradford protein assay and equivalent protein
amounts loaded into precast NuPage Novex Bis-Tris
10% gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA.) and miniprotean TGX gels (4-20%, 7.5%, 10% and 12%; Bio-Rad).
Immunoblotting was performed in duplicate or triplicate
using commercially available antibodies from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (CD31, Cytochrome C, GAPDH, P16, P21,
PCNA) and Cell Signaling (AKT, BAK1, BAX, BCL-xL,
Beclin-1, Caspases 3/4/7/8/9, LC3B, Cyclin A1, Cyclin

P-JNK, P-pTEN, P-P38, P-p70S6K, P-mTOR, p70S6K,
all P53 family member antibodies and P73) to proteins of
interest. Expression values normalized to loading controls
were determined by chemiluminescent immunodetection
with fold-change from baseline or first appearance
reported.

Cell culture
Authenticated human EAC cell lines utilized in this
series of experiments [32] included JH-ESOAd1, referred
to as JHAD1, isolated from a distal EAC, stage III, N0 in
1997 (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD); OE33
cells isolated in 1993 from a distal EAC, stage II, N0,
(ECACC, Wiltshire, UK); and OE19 cells isolated in 1993
from an adenocarcinoma at the gastro-esophageal junction,
stage III, N1 (ECACC, Wiltshire, UK). Cells were grown
in RPMI 1640 complete medium containing L-glutamine
(2.0 mM), penicillin (104 units/mL), streptomycin (104
μg/mL), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and 5-10% fetal
bovine serum depending on the experiment. Cells were
maintained as monolayers at 37 °C with 95% air and 5%
CO2 for all studies.

Acidified bile challenge and development of acid/
bile resistant cells

Determination of apoptosis, phase of cell cycle
and BrdU levels by flow cytometry

EAC cells were treated with a 0.2mM acidified
bile cocktail (pH = 4.0) comprised of equal amounts
taurocholic, glycocholic, glycodeoxycholic, glycochenodeoycholic and deoxycholic acids (Sigma-Aldrich)
mimicking human refluxant [27]. Cells received either
a single 5 minute pulsatile treatment with an acidified
bile cocktail or a single treatment, followed by multiple
additional exposures of 7.5 minutes every other day to
simulate repeated reflux episodes. Each cell line was
evaluated in terms of constitutive acid sensitivity, capacity
to develop acid resistance and whether resistance impacted
mode of C-PAC induced cell death.

OE19, JHAD1 and OE33 cells were plated in T25
flasks at 1.5E6, 1.0E6 and 1.0E6 cells, respectively and
incubated for 24-30 hours prior to treatment with C-PAC
[50 or 100 μg/ml] or vehicle [<0.001% ETOH] in phenol
red free RPMI complete medium with 5% FBS. Each
evaluation was performed in triplicate per experimental
time-point. Cell cycle distribution was assessed at 24 and
48 hours utilizing propidium iodide (PI) detection (BD
Sciences, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described [1618]. Briefly, harvested cells were fixed in ice cold 70%
EtOH, washed in PBS and stained with PI. A minimum
of 20,000 cells were analyzed per treatment utilizing a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer. ModFit LT software (Verity,
Topsham, ME) was used to determine the percentage of
cells in each phase of the cell cycle (G0-G1, S, G2-M).
Concurrent BrdU [10µM, 1h incubation] and PI staining
was conducted to improve our understanding of the
S-phase distribution beyond that provided by PI-based
analysis alone. BrdU distribution and intensity of staining
was detected by FACSCalibur analyzing a minimum of
10,000 cells; whereas, Annexin V-FITC staining methods
were employed to detect apoptotic and necrotic events
counting a minimum of 10,000 cells with Flowjo software
employed for analysis.

Transmission electron microscopy
OE19 and JHAD1 cells were plated (2.5E4 and
1.2E4, respectively) in LabTek 4 well permanox chamber
slides with RPMI complete medium and adhered for 30
hours prior to C-PAC [50 µg/ml] treatment. Cells were
harvested at 6 and 24 hours post-treatment and fixed
overnight in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.1M sucrose, followed by
dehydration in a graded series of acetone, infiltration
with resin, embedding, and preparation of 80 nm sections
and staining. Sections were examined and transmission
electron images captured to assess the ultrastructural
features and the formation of autophagic vacuoles.

Protein isolation and Western blot analysis
JHAD1, OE33 and OE19 EAC cells were plated
in T75 flasks at 1.5E6, 1.5E6 and 3E6 cells, respectively.
Cells adhered for 24-30 hours, were treated with C-PAC
[50 μg/mL] or vehicle and harvested at 0, 6, 24 and 48

All experimental procedures were conducted in
accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional
Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Miami. Twelve 5-6 week old male NU/
NU athymic mice were purchased from Charles Rivers
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Mice were fed irradiated
synthetic AIN93G diet and provided water ad libitum.
OE19 cells were suspended in RPMI medium and matrigel
and subcutaneously implanted at a concentration of
1.25E6 cells in each flank; cells grew for 5 days reaching
a mean tumor volume of 150 mm3 prior to mice being
randomized to vehicle or C-PAC treatment groups. C-PAC
was delivered by oral gavage (100 µl) at a concentration
of 250 µg/mouse, 6 days a week. Tumors were measured
every 2-3 days throughout the experiment and mean tumor
volume calculated using the following formula: π/6 x L x
W x H (L, length; W, width; H, height). Increasing tumor
size in the vehicle treated group required termination of
the experiment on day 19. OE33 and JHAD1 cells did not
generate tumors in this animal model, even when higher
concentrations of cells were injected supporting that OE19
cells are phenotypically more aggressive.
