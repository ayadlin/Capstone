BACKGROUND. The efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in patients who have brain metastases from melanoma is limited. In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy of treatment with temozolomide in patients with metastatic melanoma,
including small brain metastases, who did not require immediate RT and investi-

METHODS. Patients with brain metastasis were identified from 3 prospective stunoma. Patients with brain metastasis that measured >2 cm, extensive edema,
and localization in the brain stem were excluded from the study. For the current
analysis, patients with leptomeningeal metastasis and patients who received previous stereotactic RT were excluded. In patients who achieved a systemic response or stabilization to temozolomide, the response of brain metastasis and
the necessity for palliative cranial RT were evaluated.

RESULTS. Among 179 patients who received temozolomide for advanced melanoma, 52 patients with brain metastasis were evaluable. Stabilization of systemic
metastasis was noted in 7 of 52 patients (13%), and there were 6 responses (5
partial responses and 1 complete response; 11%); thus, in those 13 patients, 6
had stabilization of brain metastasis (11%) and 5 had a response (2 partial
responses and 3 complete responses; 9%). Immunotherapy did not influence the
neurologic response. The median time to neurologic progression was 7 months
(range 2–15, months). RT for cerebral recurrence was required in 2 patients. The
median survival of patients with brain metastases was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval, 4.4–6.8 months). Intracranial hemorrhagic complications were not
observed.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that it is feasible to treat patients
who have advanced melanoma and small brain metastasis with temozolomide as
the single treatment. The small subset of patients with systemic response usually
showed durable stabilization or a response of brain metastasis. With this approach,
neurologic disease can be controlled, and cranial irradiation may be deferred and
even withheld in most of patients. Cancer 2007;109:306–12.

elanoma has a high propensity to metastasize to the brain
with reported incidence from 10% in clinical series to >50%
established by autopsy.1–3 Usually, brain metastases occur late in the
course of metastatic disease with wide-spread extracranial metastases. Metastases of melanoma in visceral sites and in the brain have
the worst prognosis. Occasionally, patients with brain metastasis
can be treated effectively with surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy

(RT) when they are confined to 3 small lesions and
when there is no extracranial disease activity.4–6 The
standard treatment for patients with symptomatic
brain metastasis and active extracranial metastases
consists of whole-brain RT (WBRT) in combination
with corticosteroids that, nonetheless, is barely effective (the median survival is about 3, and most treated patients dye of neurologic disease).1,2,7–9 In fact,
the objective response rate of symptomatic brain
metastasis from melanoma to conventional WBRT
probably is not greater than 15%7,10; and, for the majority of patients, the burden of such treatment may
have more negative impact on the quality of life than
the doubtful benefit to survival compared with corticosteroids and other supportive measures. Data
about the efficacy of RT in patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis from melanoma are lacking.
The standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma is dacarbazine, which produces systemic response rates from 10% to 15% and produces
somewhat lower response rates in visceral sites.11,12
A randomized trial comparing temozolomide with
dacarbazine in patients with metastatic melanoma
showed equivalent response rates and survival.11
Temozolomide is an analogue of dacarbazine that
has excellent oral bioavailability and relatively high
central nervous system (CNS) penetration. A large
Phase II study of temozolomide for patients with
brain metastasis from melanoma13 who did not
require immediate RT showed that temozolomide
was tolerated well and produced an overall objective
response rate of 6% and a stable disease (SD) rate of
26%, which is comparable to the response in patients
with visceral extracranial metastasis. In the current
study, we assessed the response of brain metastasis
in patients who showed a response to temozolomide
of systemic metastatic disease, and we evaluated
whether it is feasible to defer or possibly withhold
cranial RT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The group of patients for this report consisted of
patients with metastatic melanoma from 3 consecutive prospective studies: 1) a Phase II study with
escalating doses of temozolomide (150–250 mg/m2)
for 5 days followed by immunotherapy with subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage–colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) (2.5 mg/kg), subcutaneous low-dose
interleukin 2 (IL-2) (4 MIU/m2), and subcutaneous
interferon a (IFNa) (5 MIU fixed dose) for 12 days
every 4 weeks, as described previously14; 2) a Phase
III study with temozolomide 200 mg/m2 for 5 days
every 4 weeks with or without immunotherapy as

307

described above; and 3) a Phase II study with temozolomide 200 mg/m2 for 5 days every 4 weeks.
Eligibility criteria for the 3 studies were histologically proven melanoma with extracranial metastatic
disease, age >18 years, a Karnofsky performance status
70, adequate bone marrow function (leukocytes,
4.0  109/L; platelets, >100  109/L), adequate renal function (creatinine, <180 mmol/L), and adequate
liver function (transaminase and alkaline phosphatase
levels, <3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]; in
patients with liver metastases, <5 times the ULN; bilirubin, within normal limits). No previous chemotherapy or immunotherapy except adjuvant IFNa was
allowed. All patients had gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans as a
screening procedure before the start of treatment.
Patients who had brain metastases that measured >2
cm in greatest dimension, localization in the brain
stem, and edema that required steroid treatment were
excluded. Whether edema required steroid treatment
was determined by an experienced neurologist (W.B.)
and was based on neurologic and radiologic findings.
From the total of 179 patients who were included in
the 3 prospective studies, 57 patients also had evidence of CNS metastasis. For the current study of patients with brain metastases, previous stereotactic RT
(n ¼ 1 patient) and leptomeningeal metastasis (n ¼ 4
patients) were excluded.

Evaluation of Response
Radiologic studies of all involved sites were obtained
at baseline and after every even-numbered treatment
cycle. Responses of both intracranial and extracranial
sites were defined according to the following criteria:
a complete response (CR) was defined as the complete disappearance of tumor, a partial response (PR)
was defined as a decrease 50% in the product of
the 2 greatest perpendicular tumor dimensions, SD
was defined as a decrease <50% or an increase
<25% in the product of the greatest perpendicular
tumor dimensions, and progressive disease (PD) was
defined as an increase >25% in the product of the
greatest perpendicular tumor dimensions or the
appearance of new lesions.
Responses in intracranial sites and extracranial
sites were recorded separately. In patients who were
diagnosed with overt clinical and radiologic extracranial PD that resulted in the decision to stop further
chemotherapy (n ¼ 40 patients), MRI brain scans
were not obtained routinely. Therefore, for the current study, the evaluation of response of brain metastases was restricted to patients who had disease
stabilization or patients who had a response of extracranial metastatic disease (n ¼ 13 patients).

Statistical Analysis
Survival was calculated from the start of treatment
until death. Survival curves were constructed by
using the Kaplan Meier method. Comparison of the
curves between the groups was done by using the
log-rank test.

RESULTS
Eighty-one patients were included in the Phase II
study of escalating-dose temozolomide with immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, 79 patients were
enrolled in the randomized Phase III study of temozolomide with or without immunotherapy, and 19
patients were included in the Phase II study of temozolomide alone. The characteristics of the patients
are listed in Table 1. The majority of patients (68%)
had visceral metastases. The characteristics of the 52
evaluable patients who had brain metastases are
listed in Table 2. Among these patients (23 patients
who received temozolomide with immunotherapy
and 29 patients who received temozolomide without
immunotherapy), 6 patients (11%) showed a response

and 4 patients after temozolomide alone), and 7 patients (13%) had stabilization of extracranial metastatic
melanoma (4 patients after temozolomide and immunotherapy and 3 patients after temozolomide alone),

these 13 patients, 5 patients (9%) showed a response of

stabilization of brain metastasis (4 patients after temozolomide and immunotherapy and 2 patients after
temozolomide alone), accounting for 21% response or
stabilization (Table 3). The disease characteristics of
these 11 patients (Table 4) did not differ significantly
from the nonresponders. Eight of 11 responders had

no neurologic symptoms. Six patients had a single
brain metastasis, and 5 patients had multiple brain
metastases. The median time to neurologic progression in these 11 patients was 7 months (range, from 2
months to 15 months). Two patients received cranial
RT for cerebral PD after a time to neurologic progression of 3 months and 5 months. One patient who previously had received WBRT for brain metastasis
received supportive care alone for a cerebral recurrence after a time to progression of 2 months. The
other 8 patients did not need specific treatment for
their brain metastases.
Among 40 patients with brain metastases and
extracranial PD, 29 patients had documented progression, and 2 patients had stabilization of brain
metastases; whereas, in 9 patients, follow-up MRI
brain scans were not obtained. Sixteen patients
received cranial RT, and 1 of those patients had a
documented response to RT.

Survival
The median overall survival for the entire group of
179 patients was 7.4 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6.4–8.4 months). The median survival
was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.4–6.8 months) for the 52
patients with brain metastases who were evaluable
and 8.4 months (95% CI, 5.9–10.9 months) for the
other 127patients (log-rank P < .001). Among the 122
patients without CNS metastasis, 58 patients had
only skin, lymph node, soft tissue (American Joint
Commission on Cancer stage M1a), and/or lung metastasis (M1b) (median survival, 10.8 months; 95%
CI, 6.5–15 months), and 64 patients had visceral metastasis (M1c) (median survival, 6.8 months; 95% CI,
4.7–9.0 months; log-rank P < .0001) (Table 5, Fig. 1).
The major cause of death in the 11 patients who
responded was neurologic PD in 3 patients and
extracranial PD in 6 patients. One patient remained
alive, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up because of
emigration with neurologic SD after 5 months from
start of treatment. The major cause of death in the
40 patients who had brain metastases with extracranial PD was extracranial PD in 17 patients, neurologic PD in 12 patients, both extracranial and
intracranial PD in 10 patients, and it was unknown
in 1 patient.

tions were not observed. Immunotherapy did not
cause signs or symptoms of brain edema.

DISCUSSION
Patients who have systemic metastatic disease and
brain metastases have a grave prognosis; and, among
them, patients who have melanoma fare worse. From
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group studies on
brain metastases in solid tumors, it was calculated
that the median survival was 4.2 months for patients
who had extracranial metastatic disease and a high
pretreatment performance status (recursive partitioning analysis [RPA] class 2); and, for patients who had
a Karnofsky index <70, the median survival was 2.3
months (RPA class 3).15 Patients with brain metastases from melanoma who received WBRT had a median survival of 2.3 months for RPA class 2 and 0.7
months for RPA class 3.16
The reported objective response rates of symptomatic brain metastases from melanoma to WBRT
range from 11% to 14%.2,7–10,16 These data indicate
that WBRT is of little benefit in the majority of
patients who have symptomatic brain metastases
from melanoma. In addition, the duration of such
treatment will take a substantial part of the rest of
these patients lives, and its side effects, like fatigue,
nausea, and hair loss, signify an additional burden
for these patients.
A few small, Phase II studies have addressed the
efficacy of cranial RT in combination with chemotherapy. In patients who had mainly asymptomatic
brain metastases, the combination of RT with temozolomide produced an objective response rate of
9.7% and a median progression-free survival of 2
months,17 which does not seem any better than the
results from treatment with RT alone. In combination
with fotemustine or dacarbazine, responses were
observed in individual patients, but considerable toxicity also was reported.18,19
In the current study, we observed that most of
the patients who responded with their systemic disease also showed a response of their brain metastases. Neurologic stabilization or responses appeared
to be meaningful, with a median time to progression
of 7 months. In only 2 of the 11 stabilized or
responding patients, cerebral recurrence required
cranial RT. The long median time to progression of 7
months was striking but may be explained by the
small size of brain metastases in the study population, the favorable performance status, and the paucity of neurologic symptoms. However, a clear
relation between brain tumor size or neurologic
symptoms and the time to progression has never

been reported. Choi et al. reported that survival did
not differ between asymptomatic, insignificantly
symptomatic, or moderately symptomatic patients
with brain metastases from melanoma; however, survival was significantly shorter in patients who had
major symptoms.8 In the same study, no difference
in survival was observed between patients with single
or multiple brain metastases. An analysis of 355
patients with brain metastases from melanoma indicated that age >65 years, extracranial metastases, the
presence of neurologic symptoms, and multiple
brain metastases were negative prognostic factors for
survival.20 Among the 11 neurologically stabilized or
responding patients in the current study, 1 patient
was aged >65 years, all patients had extracranial
metastatic disease, 8 patients had no neurologic
symptoms, and 6 patients had a single brain metastasis. The observed response rate of 9% and the stabilization of 11% of brain metastases in the current
study are in line with the treatment results from a
Phase II trial of temozolomide for brain metastases
from melanoma that, similar to the current study,
did not require immediate irradiation and showed a
response rate of 6% and a stabilization rate of 26%.13
Patient- or disease-related characteristics that
distinguished patients with control of neurologic disease from nonresponders could not be demonstrated
in the current study. Therefore, stabilization or response
of extracranial metastatic melanoma to temozolomide was the only predictor of control of neurologic
disease.
Fotemustine also has demonstrated activity in
brain metastases from melanoma. The response rates
of brain metastases to fotemustine as single agent in
Phase II studies ranged between 8% and 28%.21–24
However, in a recent, large, Phase III study that compared fotemustine with dacarbazine in patients with
metastatic melanoma, the response of brain metastases was 5.9% after treatment with fotemustine versus
0% after dacarbazine.21 Anecdotal responses also
were reported after other cytotoxic regimens, predominantly in patients with favorable characteristics
like solitary, small, or asymptomatic brain metastases. A response to cisplatin and dacarbazine was
reported in 2 of 18 patients (11%) who had brain metastases, whereas the response rate among patients
without brain metastases was 13%.25 A combination
of temozolomide and docetaxel induced a PR in 3 of
8 patients with brain metastases from melanoma.26
Temozolomide has also been combined with thalidomide because of the possible immunomodulatory
and antiangiogenic activity of thalidomide. The rate
of response of brain metastases to this combination
regimen was 12%, and the rate of stabilization in the

Temozolomide in Small Brain Metastases/Boogerd et al.

brain was 27%, although there was a high rate of vascular complications (42%).20 A randomized Phase II
trial did not show differences in the low response of
brain metastases (overall, 1 response in 21 patients)
between temozolomide alone, in combination with
IFNa, or in combination with thalidomide.27 In addition, in the current study, no difference in response
was observed between patients who received temozolomide alone or in combination with IL-2 and
IFNa. The response of extracranial metastatic disease
in the current study is in agreement with the results
from a Phase III study of temozolomide versus
dacarbazine for metastatic melanoma.11
The high incidence of brain metastases in metastatic melanoma and the minimally effective treatment
of large and symptomatic brain metastases suggest
that screening for brain metastases in patients with
metastatic melanoma may be relevant. Early treatment of asymptomatic brain metastases with cranial
RT may prevent them from becoming symptomatic
and, thus, may improve clinical outcome. However, it
is unknown how effective RT may be in patients who
have asymptomatic brain metastases from melanoma, and cranial RT has side effects that affect
quality of life. Moreover, screening for brain metastases may yield false-positive results. and it is obvious
that the vast majority of patients with advanced melanoma and asymptomatic brain metastases will die
of progressive extracranial disease. The discrepancy
between the incidence of brain metastases from melanoma at autopsy and in clinical series indicates that
a substantial proportion of brain metastases has
been unrecognized clinically and, thus, is irrelevant.
Therefore, screening for brain metastases in patients
with metastatic melanoma probably is not useful. In
the current study, screening for brain metastases was
undertaken because of the risk of a pathologic increase in brain edema caused by immunotherapy.
Neurologic complications of immunotherapy in our
patients with brain metastases were not encountered.
Management of treatment was not influenced by the
finding of brain metastases on screening MRI scans.
This suggests that screening for brain metastases is
not indicated in patients who will be treated with
temozolomide for metastatic melanoma. However,
we cannot exclude the possibility that outcomes may
have been different with use of other cytotoxic drugs.
In contrast to other drugs, temozolomide penetrates
the blood-brain barrier. Brain metastases usually develop behind an intact blood-brain barrier, and tumor angiogenesis probably begins when a tumor
exceeds 1 mm in size.28 Accordingly, patients with
metastatic melanoma who respond to temozolomide
develop less CNS metastases as the first site of recur-

311

rence compared with responders to dacarbazine.14,29
These results also suggest that small lesions probably
are treated more successfully with temozolomide. We
did not observe intracranial hemorrhagic complications in the 13 patients who responded. Brain metastases from melanoma are notorious for their bleeding
tendency. An incidence of hemorrhage 40% has been
reported, and the risk increases along with the increased size of metastatic lesions.4,30 The incidence of
intracranial hemorrhage was 27% in a study with
temozolomide plus thalidomide for brain metastases
from melanoma.8 In conclusion, it is feasible and ethical to treat patients who have advanced metastatic
melanoma, including small and minor symptomatic
brain metastases, with temozolomide alone and to defer cranial RT.
