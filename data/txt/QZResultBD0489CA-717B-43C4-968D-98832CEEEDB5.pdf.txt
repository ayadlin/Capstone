Abstract

Introduction

The lack of safe and efficient systemic gene delivery vectors
has largely reduced the potential of gene therapy in the clinic.
Previously, we have reported that polypropylenimine dendrimer PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles are capable of tumor transfection upon systemic administration in tumor-bearing mice.
To be safely applicable in the clinic, it is crucial to investigate
the colloidal stability of nanoparticles and to monitor the
exact biodistribution of gene transfer in the whole body of
the live subject. Our biophysical characterization shows
that dendrimers, when complexed with DNA, are capable
of forming spontaneously in solution a supramolecular
assembly that possesses all the features required to diffuse
in experimental tumors through the enhanced permeability
and retention effect. We show that these nanoparticles are
of sizes ranging from 33 to 286 nm depending on the DNA
concentration, with a colloidal stable and well-organized
fingerprint-like structure in which DNA molecules are
condensed with an even periodicity of 2.8 nm. Whole-body
nuclear imaging using small-animal nano-single-photon emission computed tomography/computer tomography scanner
and the human Na/I symporter (NIS) as reporter gene shows
unique and highly specific tumor targeting with no detection
of gene transfer in any of the other tissues of tumor-bearing
mice. Tumor-selective transgene expression was confirmed by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR at autopsy of scanned
animals, whereas genomic PCR showed that the tumor sites
are the predominant sites of nanoparticle accumulation.
Considering that NIS imaging of transgene expression has
been recently validated in humans, our data highlight the
potential of these nanoparticles as a new formulation for
cancer gene therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2655–62]

To be efficient against cancer, the ideal antitumoral agent would
have to target malignant cells throughout the body while sparing
normal tissues. Cancer gene therapy has thus far been limited by
the lack of systemically active, cancer-specific delivery vectors (1),
especially in the field of nonviral, synthetic gene delivery vectors
(2–4). In this context, we have recently described that nanoparticles composed of the polypropylenimine dendrimers of third
generation (PPIG3), when complexed with DNA, are capable of
efficient gene transfer to tumor deposits, upon systemic injection.
Importantly, when a therapeutic transgene was used, marked
antitumor activity was observed, leading, in some experiments, to
the ‘‘cure’’ of all animals treated (5, 6).
Key to the furthering clinical development of this technology and
its safe application in patients is the ability to monitor gene transfer
in the live subject, using a minimally invasive method. This is of
particular importance considering the toxic nature of the therapeutic transgenes required for cancer gene therapy. Whole-body
nuclear imaging of gene transfer in the live subject has been
described (7) and requires a reporter gene and a radiolabeled tracer.
One possible strategy exploits the Na/I symporter (NIS) as a reporter
gene and radio-halogen as tracer. NIS is endogenously expressed in
the thyroid and stomach and, to a lower extent, in the salivary
glands, breast, and thymus (8). In the thyroid, NIS promotes iodide
concentration, and radio-iodide uptake is used in the detection and, in some specific cases, in the treatment of disseminated
thyroid carcinomas (9). In gene therapy experiments, ectopic expression of NIS has been shown to allow accumulation of radioactive
iodide in tissues for noninvasive imaging (10–12). Moreover, ectopic
NIS expression is unlikely to interfere with the cell biochemistry.
Different modalities have been reported to image NIS-expressing
tissues, including positron emission tomography (PET), scintigraphic imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT; refs. 13–16). The imaging of NIS-expressing tissues is
particularly versatile because NIS can promote cellular uptake of
different radioisotopes: 123I (SPECT), 124I (PET), 99-mTcO4
(SPECT), and 131I (scintigraphic imaging; refs. 8, 11). This imaging
method has very recently been validated in humans (17).
Another consideration that is key to the translation of PPGI3/
DNA complexes to the clinic is the biophysical characterization of the nanoparticles. Delivery of polymer-drug conjugates
containing doxorubicin (18), paclitaxel (19), or camptothecin
(20) to tumors has been described and some of these compounds

are in phase III clinical trials (21). These complexes have been
shown to remain for long periods in the blood stream and
accumulate passively in tumor tissues through a phenomenon
referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention effect
(EPR). The EPR effect first described by Matsumura and Maeda
(22, 23) constitutes an important mechanism by which ‘‘objects’’
with adapted size and surface characteristics can extravasate
through the endothelial fenestration of tumor blood tissues, usually
larger and more disorganized than normal blood tissues. As a
result, these ‘‘objects’’ are preferentially retained in the tumors
and, thus, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties
of the associated-drugs are enhanced compared with administration of the drug alone (24, 25). Nanoparticles exploiting the
EPR effect for cancer-selective delivery of nucleic acids would be
highly desirable.
In this context, the aim of the present study is (a) to determine
whether the biophysical characteristics of PPIG3/DNA complexes
are compatible with the EPR effect, (b) to assess whether NISimaging can be used to visualize nanoparticle-mediated gene
transfer, and (c) to determine the pattern of gene expression
allowed by these nanoparticles in tumor-bearing mice.

Materials and Methods
Nanoparticles and plasmid DNA. The nanoparticles used in this study
are constituted of PPIG3 and prepared in 5% dextrose solution as previously
described (5). The NIS cDNA was amplified by PCR from pTGW10 plasmid
(13) using the primers 5¶-CTCTAGAGATGGAGGCCGTGGAGACCGGGGAACGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CTCTAGAGCTGCGCCTTTGGCCTAATAC-3¶
(reverse) and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression
plasmid DNA (Invitrogen).
Dynamic light scattering, fluorescence, and cryo-transmission
electron microscopy studies. Dynamic light scattering, fluorescence, and
cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) studies were done as
previously described (26, 27). PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles were prepared by
combining increased concentration of PPIG3 dendrimer (0-3 Ag/AL) with a
fixed-standardized concentration of DNA plasmid (10 Ag/mL) in 1 mL of 5%
dextrose. After 10-min incubation at room temperature, the hydrodynamic
mean diameter of nanoparticles formed was determined by dynamic light
scattering using the intensity mean size (Z average) with a sample refractive
index of 1.59 and a viscosity of 0.89 cP. The system was routinely calibrated
using a 220-nm standard dts 5050 from Malvern Instrument. Data presented
are the mean diameters F SE of nanoparticles measured from three
independent experiments. To evaluate the level of DNA condensation,
5 nmol/L final concentration of ethidium bromide was added to the tubes,
and fluorescence measurement assessed 5 min later at 600 nm on a Kontron
SFM25 spectrofluorimeter (Kontron). Structural information and size of
PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles were determined by cryo-TEM assay. PPIG3
dendrimer (1 Ag/AL) was combined with DNA plasmid at the indicated
concentration and let to assemble for 10 min. A 5-AL aliquot was deposited
onto a holey carbon-coated copper grid and plunged into a liquid ethane
bath cooled with liquid nitrogen. The grids containing the frozen samples
were thereafter mounted onto a Gatan 626 cryoholder, and samples
observed with a Tecnai F20 FEI transmission electron microscope,
operating at 200 kV. Low-dose images were recorded at a nominal
magnification of 50,000 with a 2k  2k USC1000 slow-scan chargecoupled device camera (Gatan). To determine formation of highly ordered
phases between the PPIG3 dendrimer and DNA molecules, periodic
information within the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticle structures was investigated using the Image J analysis program applied to the pictures from the cryoTEM analysis. The procedure consists of computing the Fourier transform
and in displaying the power spectrum image. DNA spacing is calculated
from measurements of distance of the first-order peaks based on the
fact that in Fourier space this distance is proportional to the inverse length
of DNA spacing.

Cell lines. All cell lines used were obtained from Cancer Research UK
Cell Services. The cell lines A431, HeLa, and HeP-2 were grown in DMEM,
supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The SCC25
cell line was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F-12 medium,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 ng/mL hydrocortisone.
Animals. All experiments were conducted with appropriate ethical
approval and in accordance with the Guidance on the operation of the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (House of Commons 1990) of the
U.K Home Office regulations. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu
or C3H mice (Harlan) were allowed to acclimatize for 1 wk and kept in
individualized ventilated cages with free access to food and water. Tumor
cells (106) were implanted subcutaneously in the right flanks of mice and
kept until tumors reached f200 mm3. PPIG3 dendrimer and plasmid DNA
encoding NIS were then complexed in 250 AL of a 5% dextrose solution
at a ratio of 5:1 (w/w) with 50 Ag of plasmid DNA and 250 Ag of dendrimer
(5). The final concentration of nanoparticle components was therefore
200 Ag/mL for the plasmid DNA and 1 Ag/AL for the PPIG3 dendrimers.
After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the resulting PPIG3/DNA
nanoparticles were injected intratumorally or i.v. into the tail vein of
mice bearing tumors (n = 3). Control mice were treated with PBS (n = 3),
PPIG3 nanoparticles (n = 3), or plasmid DNA alone (n = 3). Animals were
weighed every 5 d; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) serum transaminase activity levels were determined
from blood samples collected at the indicated times in the text. Histologic
examniations of liver, lungs, spleen, and kidney were done 5 d after the
systemic administration of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles.
Nano-SPECT/computer tomography imaging. Small-animal SPECT/
computer tomography (CT) scanning was done as previously described (28).
Twenty-four hours after administration of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles, animals were anesthetized and then given an i.v. injection of 18.5MBq
of 99-mTc. Alternatively, different scans were done on the same cohort of
animals 10, 24, 48, and 72 h after administration of the PPIG3/DNA
nanoparticles. Mice were then positioned inside the SPECT/CT scanner
(Bioscan, Inc.). The SPECT image was obtained, and acquisition time
depended on specific radioactivity levels in each mouse over the limits of
the scan to obtain 100,000 cps. A CT scan was taken at the same limits as
the SPECT scan and all images were reconstructed with MEDISO software
(Medical Imaging Systems). Fusion of SPECT and CT images was carried out
using PMOD software (Medical Imaging Systems).
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and genomic PCR. To detect
NIS mRNA expression in tissues, scanned animals were sacrificed and the
tumor, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and bone marrow tissues were harvested.
Tissues were homogenized and total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy
Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). Reverse
transcription followed by quantitative PCR was done from 2 Ag of tRNA
extracted as previously described (28). To detect plasmid DNA in tissues,
quantitative genomic PCR was done. Tissues were harvested and genomic
DNA was extracted using DNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Qiagen). DNA concentration and purity were determined using
NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Five nanograms of
DNA sample were used in each quantitative PCR reaction in triplicate. The
PCR conditions and primers were the same as those used for the reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) described above. Negative controls included
PCR reaction without the cDNA or the genomic DNA.
Statistical analysis. The experiments were done at least thrice in
triplicate. Errors bars represent SE. One-way ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni posttest (GraphPad Prism software) was used to determine
statistical significance for the following experiments: quantitative RT-PCR;
genomic PCR; body weight and serum transaminase activity measurements;
and nanoparticle uptake, luciferase activity, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays.

nanoparticles obtained by mixing the PPIG3 dendrimer with a
plasmid DNA encoding NIS. Dynamic light scattering was first used
to assess the colloidal stability of the formed nanoparticles as a
function of the charge ratio. To calculate the mean theoretical
charge ratio, we assumed that 1 Ag of plasmid DNA is 3 nmol of
negatively charged phosphate and that 16 positive charges are
displayed by the PPIG3 dendrimer according to its chemical
formulation and molecular weight (PPIG3, 1.67 kDa). Increasing
concentrations of PPIG3 dendrimer (0-3 Ag/AL) were left to
assemble to a constant concentration of DNA plasmid (10 Ag/mL)
for 10 minutes before determining the size of the formed
nanoparticles using a Zetasizer instrument. Results in Fig. 1
show that the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles exhibit a three-zone
model of colloidal stability depending on the cationic vector/
DNA charge ratio used. In zone A (i.e., for a charge ratio <1), we
found colloidal stable, negatively charged complexes with a mean
diameter of 107 F 17 nm (n = 3). In zone B, characterized by
dendrimer/DNA charge ratios ranging from 1 to 1.5, the complexes
were neutral, large, and colloidally unstable as evidenced by
the observation that their diameter increased up to 402 F 56 nm
(n = 3). Finally, in zone C (i.e., for a charge ratio above 1.5),
we observed colloidal stable, positively charged complexes with a
mean diameter of 86 F 9 nm (n = 3). These results show that

PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles followed the well-known three-stage
model of colloidal stability described elsewhere (3, 26, 27, 29).
Next, we investigated the level of DNA condensation using
fluorescence measurement after addition of ethidium bromide in
all samples. The percentage of free DNA or DNA bound loosely
to PPIG3 dendrimer was then estimated at 600 nm. As expected
(Fig. 1), the fluorescence intensity decreased as the dendrimer/DNA
charge ratio increased from 100% in zone A to a low minimal value
in zones B and C. The very low level of fluorescence intensity in
zones B and C indicates that DNA molecules in theses zones are
firmly packed within the nanoparticle structure, preventing their
interaction with ethidium bromide molecules and, consequently,
with any other components of the extracellular media.
Structural features of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles by
cryo-TEM imaging and the Fourier transform method. The
structure of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles was finally examined
using cryo-electron microscopy (Fig. 2). Cryo-TEM allows visualizing nanoparticles with their native contrast without the need of
dehydration or staining procedures. Therefore, when combined to
Image J software and the Fourier method, cryo-TEM images
provide accurate information about the structure and the size of
nanoparticles. Plasmid DNAs were mixed with the PPIG3 dendrimers (1 Ag/AL), and the size of nanoparticles was determined

individually. At a DNA concentration of 100 Ag/mL, corresponding
to a PPIG3 dendrimer/DNA charge ratio of 16, globular structures
ranging in size from 103 to 255 nm were observed (Fig. 2A–D).
When the DNA concentration was halved (50 Ag/mL) with the
same dendrimer/DNA charge ratio, the same globular structure
was observed but the size of particles was smaller, ranging from 38
to 152 nm (Fig. 2E–H). The average size of the PPIG3/DNA
nanoparticles was 78 F 14 nm (7 particles analyzed) for a DNA
concentration of 50 Ag/mL, 150 F 26 nm (7 particles analyzed) for
a DNA concentration of 100 Ag/mL, and 286 F 41 nm (7 particles
analyzed) for a DNA concentration of 200 Ag/mL. At higher DNA
concentrations, the complex precipitated. These results show that
the size of PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles was directly dependent on
the DNA loaded and led, as shown in the gallery of Fig. 2, to the
formation of compact, concentric, and homogeneous structures
with a fingerprint-like aspect. Image analysis based on the use of
Fourier transform showed that despite the lack of a highly ordered
organization, a repeat distance of f2.8 nm corresponding to DNA
strand packing was detected. Taken together, these data show that
the PPIG3 dendrimer when complexed with plasmid DNA displays
a set of biophysical characteristics that are suitable for a tumorspecific gene transfer mediated by the EPR effect (22, 23).
Visualization of nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer upon
intratumoral injection. To monitor the exact localization and
amplitude of gene transfer in the whole body of tumor-bearing
mice, we first examined gene transfer on intratumoral injection of
the nanoparticles. Mice with subcutaneous A431 tumors were
injected with PPIG3 dendrimers (250 Ag) complexed with a plasmid
DNA encoding NIS (50 Ag), forming, as shown above, nanoparticles
averaging 286 nm (F 41) in size. Twenty-four hours later, mice were
scanned. Fusion of the SPECT and CT images revealed that the
99-m
TcO4 tracer accumulated in the thyroid gland and the stomach
(Fig. 3A) as a result of endogenous expression of the NIS gene
(10–13) and in the tumor (Fig. 3A) as a result of gene transfer.
Control, intratumoral injections of PBS, DNA, or PPIG3 alone failed
to result in radiotracer accumulation in the tumor whereas signals
not related to gene transfer (thyroid and stomach) were detected
(data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR done on tumor biopsies
harvested at autopsy of the scanned animals revealed the presence of NIS-specific mRNA (48.2 F 8.2 pg/Ag tRNA), confirming in vivo gene transfer upon intratumoral injection of the
PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles. By contrast, a very low presence of NISspecific mRNA was found in control mice treated with PBS
(0.28 F 0.06 pg/Ag tRNA), DNA (1.25 F 0.32 pg/Ag tRNA), or PPIG3
alone (0.62 F 0.16 pg/Ag tRNA).
Visualization of nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer upon
systemic injection in immunodeficient tumor-bearing mice. To
examine the pattern of gene transfer obtained upon systemic
injection, mice with subcutaneous Hep-2, A431, and HeLa xenograft
tumors (Fig. 4A) were injected in the tail vein with nanoparticles
(250 Ag) complexed with the plasmid encoding NIS (50 Ag).
Twenty-four hours later, mice were scanned. Fusion of the SPECT
and CT images revealed that the 99-mTcO4 tracer accumulated in
the thyroid and stomach as a result of endogenous NIS expression
(data not shown) and in the tumors (Fig. 4A). Careful examination
of all projections of the tomographic sections failed to detect any
other gene-transfer–related signal (data not shown), suggesting
that systemic nanoparticle delivery resulted in tumor-specific gene
transfer. To confirm this hypothesis, quantitative RT-PCR was done
on tumor biopsies taken from the scanned animals. Results showed
that NIS-specific mRNA was below the threshold of detection in

Figure 3. Visualization of nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer upon intratumoral
injection. A, nude mice bearing A431 subcutaneous tumors were injected
intratumorally with PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles obtained by mixing 250 Ag of PPIG3
dendrimer to 50 Ag of plasmid DNA encoding for NIS. Twenty-four hours later,
mice (n = 3) were anesthetized, injected i.p. with sodium [99-mTc]pertechnetate
(18.5 MBq), and scanned for 30 min. Mice were sacrificed at the end
of the scan. Images were reconstructed and the figure presented shows
sagittal views in the planes of the thyroid and stomach (i ) or tumor (ii ) of one
representative mouse. B, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of NIS transcript in
tumor tissues harvested at autopsy of the scanned animals. A431 subcutaneous
tumors from the three mice treated as described in A were carefully removed.
Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and amplified using NIS-specific
primers. The absolute value of NIS mRNA in samples was standardized to the
absolute value of 18S mRNA and then expressed as picograms of NIS mRNA by
micrograms of total RNA using a standard curve with different concentrations of
NIS cDNA. Columns, mean of experiments done in triplicate; bars, SE. **,

the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and lung in all tumor-bearing
mice scanned (data not shown). By contrast, NIS-specific mRNA
could be quantified in tumor samples from Hep-2 (Fig. 4B; 31.66 F
5.8 ng/Ag tRNA), A431 (27.2 F 4.2 ng/Ag tRNA), and HeLa
cells (29.6 F 6.4 ng/Ag tRNA). Taken together, these experiments
show that systemic injection of the nanoparticles results in tumorselective transgene expression.
We then assessed whether systemic gene delivery mediated by
the nanoparticles could result in gene transfer in more than one
tumor deposit. Mice with subcutaneous Hep-2, A431, and HeLa
xenograft tumors implanted in both flanks were injected systemically with the PPIG3 dendrimers (250 Ag) complexed with the DNA
plasmid encoding NIS (50 Ag). Twenty-four hours later, mice were
scanned and fusion of the SPECT and CT images was done. Result
in Fig. 4A shows a coronal image in which the two Hep-2 tumors

are in the same tomographic section. The signals observed in the
two tumors show that both have been transfected by the
PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles. Similar scans were obtained with
subcutaneous A431 and HeLa tumors (data not shown). The only
additional signals detected were in the thyroid and the stomach as a
result of endogenous NIS expression (data not shown). Quantitative
RT-PCR (Fig. 4C) analysis on tumor biopsies taken from the scanned
animals showed that gene transfer in bilateral tumors was in
the same order of magnitude: Hep-2 (right: 26.5 F 4.7 ng/Ag tRNA;
left: 31.5 F 6.1 ng/Ag tRNA), HeLa (right: 25.5 F 5.2 ng/Ag tRNA; left:
32.5 F 8.1 ng/Ag tRNA), and A431 (right: 41 F 8.1 ng/Ag tRNA; left:
31.0 F 8.0 ng/Ag tRNA). In control mice injected with PBS, DNA, or
PPIG3 alone, NIS-specific signal was below the threshold of detection
of the PCR assay (data not shown). Altogether, these data show that
gene transfer mediated by the nanoparticles is tumor specific and
can reach at least two independent tumor deposits.
Visualization of nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer upon
systemic injection in immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice.
To assess whether the nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer
remains cancer selective in an immunocompetent mouse model,
C3H mice bearing subcutaneous SCC25 tumors were i.v. injected
with the PPIG3 nanoparticles (250 Ag) complexed with the plasmid
encoding NIS (50 Ag). Mice were scanned 24 hours later. Fusion
of the SPECT and CT images revealed that, as in the case of an
immunodeficient mouse model, injection of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles results in radiotracer uptake in the tumor (Fig. 5A). In
addition, different scans were done on the same cohort 10, 24, 48,
and 72 hours after the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticle injection. In these
experiments and at each time point, the animals were anesthetized
and scanned to verify that no residual 99-mTcO4 from the previous
scan remained in the tumor. The animals were then injected with the
radiotracer, and the data acquired. Tumors were then outlined and
the radioactivity was calculated in the volume of interest. Result
in Fig. 5B shows that the mean peak of radiotracer accumulation (0.24 F 0.021 MBq) is obtained 24 hours after PPIG3/DNA

nanoparticle injection, showing the transient nature of this gene
transfer technology. In control mice injected with PBS, DNA, or
PPIG3 alone, the radioactivity value was <0.001 (data not shown).
To assess the homing of nanoparticles in mice, quantitative PCR
specific for the plasmid DNA was done on total DNA extracted
from various tissues of C3H mice bearing SCC25 tumors injected
systemically with the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles (250 Ag/50 Ag,
w/w). Result in Fig. 5C shows a low but detectable PCR signal in
the stomach (0.0012 F 0.0002 pg equivalent plasmid), thyroid
(0.002 F 0.0001 pg equivalent plasmid), kidneys (0.0002 F 0.0001 pg
equivalent plasmid), and bone marrow (0.0009 F 0.0002 pg
equivalent plasmid). A higher signal was detected in the liver
(0.0091 F 0.0006 pg equivalent plasmid), spleen (0.0033 F 0.0004 pg
equivalent plasmid), and lungs (0.0042 F 0.0018 pg equivalent
plasmid). In tumors, this signal was increased more than 20-fold
(0.192 F 0.0017 pg equivalent plasmid) compared with the liver.
These data show that the plasmid predominantly deposits in the
tumors upon injection of the nanoparticles.

NIS. Twenty-four hours later, mice (n = 3 for each tumor models) were
anesthetized, injected i.p. with sodium [99-mTc]pertechnetate (18.5 MBq), and
scanned for 30 min. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the scan. Images were

Evaluation of acute toxicity in mice and macrophage uptake
in vitro. To evaluate acute toxicity, body weight measurement, serum
AST and ALT transaminase activity levels, and tissues histology were
determined in immunocompetent mice upon systemic injection of
the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles (250 Ag/50 Ag, w/w). Results in
Supplementary Fig. S1B show a mild but significant (P < 0.01) increase
in serum AST and ALT transaminase activity levels 24 hours after the
administration. These values went back to normal level 2 days later.
This does not seem to affect the overall health of the animals because
no variation in body weight (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and no loss of
tissue integrity were detected in animals (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Finally, to assess a possible capture of the PPIG3/DNA
nanoparticles by macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte
system of mice, murine J774 A1 macrophage cell line was cultured
for 24 hours in the presence of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles

prepared by mixing the PPIG3 nanoparticles (250 Ag) with an
expression plasmid coding for the F-Luciferase gene (50 Ag), which
was previously labeled with the fluorescent DNA intercalating
agent Y0Y0-1. Data from Supplementary Fig. S2A show that 29.4 F
9.37% of J774 A1 cells were capable of taking up nanoparticles as
shown by the presence of the fluorescent dye within the cytoplasm
of these cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, no transgene
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2B) or cellular toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S2C) was observed following the uptake of the PPIG3/
DNA nanoparticles by the macrophages. These in vitro results tend
to suggest that the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles might be internalized
by macrophages in vivo. However, this uptake is low and does not
result in transgene expression.

Discussion
In this report, we show for the first time tumor-specific gene
transfer on systemic injection of nanoparticles of dendrimers in
tumor-bearing animal. Using nuclear whole-body imaging and NIS
as reporter gene, we have been able to detect a specific and unique
radiotracer uptake in tumors of both immunodeficient and
immunocompetent mice, whereas no signal was detected in
normal tissues of the animals. Importantly, quantitative RT-PCR
on different organs harvested at autopsy of the scanned animals
provided the same conclusions. A NIS-specific RT-PCR signal was
detected in tumor sites, whereas no signal above the detection
threshold was detected in kidney, liver, spleen, heart, and lungs,
known to retain nonspecifically synthetic or viral particles (30–32).
Nanoparticle biodistribution was indirectly measured by quantitative PCR on DNA extracted from various tissues 24 hours after the
systemic injection. No trace of NIS plasmid DNA was detected in
the stomach, thyroid, kidney, and bone marrow, whereas a weak
but detectable signal was measured in the liver, spleen, and lungs.
In the tumor, this signal reached 20-fold that of the liver, suggesting
an accumulation of the nanoparticle in the malignant lesion. This
property seems to be unique to the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles
because synthetic vectors are usually accumulated in abundance in
the lungs, kidney, and liver 1 hour following administration and can
be detectable for up to 3 days (30–32). This extratumoral
accumulation can in turn induce severe toxicity, which limits its

injection in immunocompetent mice. A, C3H mice bearing SCC25 tumors
were injected into the tail vein with the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles obtained by
mixing 250 Ag of PPIG3 dendrimer with 50 Ag of plasmid DNA encoding for
NIS. Twenty-four hours later, mice (n = 3) were anesthetized, injected i.p. with
sodium [99-mTc]pertechnetate (18.5 MBq), and scanned for 30 min. Mice were
sacrificed at the end of the scan. Images were reconstructed, and the figure

every 24 h. C, quantitative genomic PCR of NIS plasmid in different tissues of
immunocompetent mice bearing SCC25 tumors. Tissues from several organs
including the tumors of the three mice treated as described in A were carefully

using a standard curve with different concentrations of NIS DNA plasmid.

applications in humans. By contrast, no loss of animal body weight
or signs of long-lasting or serious toxicity were observed upon
systemic injection of the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles.
A possible explanation for this remarkable selectivity would be
the EPR effect. Conceptually, EPR exploits the aberrant biology of
solid tumors and, in particular, the architecture of their
vasculature, which is irregular in shape, dilated, and contains
endothelial cells with unusually large fenestrations (22, 23). These
characteristics, combined with a poor lymphatic drainage, result in
the fact that macromolecules with high blood circulation time and
specific features such as charge and size will be preferentially
accumulated in tumors. This accumulation has been shown to be
restricted to high molecular weight macromolecules with a slow
clearance, and this concept has given rise to at least 11 clinical
trails testing the efficacy of polymer-drug conjugates (4, 18–20).
Results from biophysical characterization show that the PPIG3/
DNA nanoparticles exhibit a set of physicochemical features that
are suitable with a passive diffusion of particles in tumors through
the EPR effect. First, the colloidal stability of supramolecular
assemblies formed between the dendrimers and plasmid DNA
follows the well-known three-stage model of colloidal stability
described with other synthetic vectors (3, 4, 26, 27). This colloidal
stability and the high positive charge of the particle are classic
features of a nonviral gene delivery vector and might lead to the
formation of monodispersed, nonaggregated particles, which could
better diffuse and interact with cellular membranes and subsequently promote internalization via endocytosis or pynocytosis
pathways (3, 26, 27, 29, 33). Second, at high charge ratio (e.g.,
ref. 16), corresponding to DNA of 200 Ag/mL complexed to the
PPIG3 dendrimer at 1 Ag/AL, the nanoparticles were found to have
a mean size of 286 F 41 nm. It is now well established that the size
of particles is probably the most important criterion for high
circulation time in blood as well as high accumulation rate in
tumor sites. Experimental studies (4, 30–32) have shown that the
size of the particles must be large enough to prevent the passage
through the small pores of glomerular filtration barrier, which is
known to be f50 nm in size with a cutoff value of 50 kDa, to
impede their elimination by renal clearance. In addition, the
nanoparticle must be >200 nm to avoid diffusion through the
endothelial fenestration of normal endothelium, which is known to
be f100 to 200 nm (34), as well as through the sinusoid in the
spleen and in the liver, which varies from 150 to 200 nm in size (35).
Our in vitro data on the macrophage uptake of PPIG3/DNA
nanoparticles indicate that the PPIG3/DNA nanoparticles may be
captured by the macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte
system organs in vivo. However, the level of uptake was low and
inferior to that found when macrophages were cultured in the
presence of an other cationic synthetic vector (e.g., Lipofectamine)
complexed with the same plasmid DNA. Consequently, particles of
286 nm in size, as found in our study, may be eliminated or
degraded more slowly and then might preferentially accumulate
through the leaky tumor vasculature characterized by gap junc-

tions >100 to 600 nm in size between endothelial cells (22, 23, 36).
Third, the nucleic acid must be properly wrapped up within the
nanoparticle to impede its degradation by serum nuclease. Our
cryo-TEM analysis in conjunction with a detailed analysis using the
Fournier method showed that DNA plasmids are firmly enclosed
within dendrimer complexes exhibiting a regular spacing f2.8 nm,
leading to the formation of a closed and concentric structure with
a fingerprint-like aspect. Observation that ethidium bromide
fluorescence decreases rapidly as the supramolecular assembly
takes place indeed supports that nanoparticles of dendrimer are
capable of strongly complexing with DNA plasmid. By analogy, it is
reasonable to speculate that DNA plasmids must be well protected
from physical fluctuations encountered when nanoparticles diffuse
i.v. (e.g., degradation by seric nucleases). Consequently, taken
together, our data show that polypropylenimine dendrimer PPIG3/
DNA nanoparticles may be compatible with an EPR effect.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that polypropylenimine
dendrimer PPIG3, when complexed with plasmid DNA, formed
colloidal stable self-assembly nanoparticles that possess the
biophysical properties compatible with features required for
passive accumulation of particles in tumor through the EPR effect.
In the context of systemic delivery, molecular imaging provides a
whole-body, minimally invasive method of transgene expression.
This unique information obtained by in vivo molecular imaging
revealed that PPIG3/DNA nanoparticle–mediated gene transfer in
tumors is transient and reaches its peak 24 hours after
administration. Considering that NIS imaging of transgene
expression has been recently validated in humans (17), our data
highlight the potential of these nanoparticles as a new formulation
for cancer gene therapy. In this context, the utilization of plasmids
with a therapeutic expression cassette (a cancer-cytotoxic cytokine
that would diffuse through the tumor, e.g., tumor necrosis factor a;
ref. 5) combined with an imaging expression cassette (in which NIS
expression is driven by a strong, ubiquitous promoter) may provide
therapeutic benefits for patients with metastatic tumors.
