BACKGROUND: The authors prospectively evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters quantifying heterogeneous perfusion pattern and residual tumor volume early during treatment in cervical cancer, and compared their predictive
power for primary tumor recurrence and cancer death with the standard clinical prognostic factors. A novel approach of augmenting the predictive power of clinical prognostic factors with MRI parameters was assessed. METHODS: Sixty-two cervical cancer patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI before and during early radiation/chemotherapy (22.5 weeks into treatment). Heterogeneous tumor perfusion was analyzed by signal intensity (SI) of each tumor voxel. Poorly
perfused tumor regions were quantified as lower 10th percentile of SI (SI[10%]). DCE-MRI and 3-dimensional (3D) tumor
volumetry MRI parameters were assessed as predictors of recurrence and cancer death (median follow-up, 4.1 years). Their
discriminating capacity was compared with clinical prognostic factors (stage, lymph node status, histology) using sensitivity/specificity and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: SI(10%) and 3D volume 2-2.5 weeks into therapy independently
predicted disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-6.5 [P ¼ .04] and HR, 1.9;
95% CI, 1.1-3.5 [P ¼ .03], respectively) and death (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5 [P ¼ .03] and HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9 [P ¼
.01], respectively), and were superior to clinical prognostic factors. The addition of MRI parameters to clinical prognostic factors increased sensitivity and specificity of clinical prognostic factors from 71% and 51%, respectively, to
100% and 71%, respectively, for predicting recurrence, and from 79% and 54%, respectively, to 93% and 60%, respectively, for predicting death. CONCLUSIONS: MRI parameters reflecting heterogeneous tumor perfusion and subtle tumor
volume change early during radiation/chemotherapy are independent and better predictors of tumor recurrence and death
than clinical prognostic factors. The combination of clinical prognostic factors and MRI parameters further improves early
prediction of treatment failure and may enable a window of opportunity to alter treatment strategy. Cancer 2010;116:903–12.

For advanced cervical cancer patients, the first-time radical treatment is the best and may be the only opportunity to
achieve a complete cure. Unfortunately, favorable clinical prognostic factors do not always translate into the successful
ultimate outcome of primary tumor control and disease-free survival. Advanced cervical cancer is a prime example of a
disease in which the early prediction of ultimate treatment outcome is critical but has been challenging to achieve.
Current gold standard clinical prognostic factors, stage,1 lymph node status2 and histology,3 are established criteria
for the selection of first-line therapy, but have been challenged by the variability of outcomes within each prognostic
category.4,5 The efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy generally cannot be reliably assessed until months after completion of all therapy by estimating tumor bulk using clinical palpation or by cervical cytology.6 Once treatment failure occurs, further treatment options are severely limited, salvage therapy is rarely effective, and outcome is dismal.7,8
Therefore, individualized and therapy-specific predictors of primary tumor control and survival that are available before or early

during a specific therapy regimen are needed to provide a
window of opportunity to modify treatment strategy up
front and improve survival.
Ultra-early individualized outcome prediction
that is available within weeks of therapy start critically
depends on the ability to quantify tumor heterogeneity
and heterogeneous responses in patients with the same
pretreatment clinical prognostic factors. Reliable clinically practical and noninvasive methods to effectively
evaluate the heterogeneous therapy response in solid
tumors have been elusive in clinical practice. Perfusion,
reflecting the effectiveness of delivery of chemotherapy,9,10 and oxygenation for radiotherapy (RT),11,12
can be highly variable within each solid tumor. Essential
information regarding this heterogeneity of perfusion13
during treatment has not been incorporated into the
treatment strategy despite its known profound impact
on therapy outcome in cervical cancer.9,10,13-18 Furthermore, accuracy of tumor volume measurement, as a
early response indicator during treatment, has also been
limited because of the irregular tumor shapes and subtlety of early volume regression.19
Advances in morphologic and functional imaging
provide an opportunity to quantify each tumors’ heterogeneity with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),20-22 and its
heterogeneous early response to a specific ongoing treatment with improved 3-dimensional (3D) MRI volume
measurement.19,23-25 In a prior exploratory study we
have identified MRI parameters of low tumor perfusion
during early therapy and high 3D tumor volume as predictors of ultimate treatment failure.26
The purpose of this study was to 1) validate and
refine DCE and 3D volumetry MRI parameters for the
prediction of ultimate treatment outcome (tumor recurrence and death) of the ongoing cytotoxic treatment in
cervical cancer, 2) compare the discriminatory value of
the MRI parameters with that of the clinical prognostic
factors, and 3) develop a novel predictive paradigm by
synergizing the prognostic power of the pretreatment clinical prognostic factors and those of the MRI parameters
obtained during early therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
Sixty-two patients with biopsy-proven advanced cervical
cancer (excluding small cell/neuroendocrine histology), who
were treated with RT and concurrent cisplatin-based chemo-

904

therapy, were studied prospectively on an institutional review
board-approved imaging protocol. Pretreatment evaluations
included routine workup following International Federation
of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines.27 Therapy
was comprised of standard RT in combination with concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy (40-50 mg/m2). RT
included external beam radiation (dose to the pelvis, 31-66
grays [Gy]; mean, 46.2 Gy), combined with brachytherapy
in all but 2 patients. Fifty patients received low-dose rate
brachytherapy (dose, 17-62 Gy; mean, 42 Gy), and 12
received high-dose rate brachytherapy (30 Gy in 5 fractions).
An average of 4.7 (range, 3-6) courses of cisplatin were given
with RT. In 3 patients, the cisplatin was combined with 5fluorouracil, and in 3 with paclitaxel.
MRI
MRI was obtained pretherapy and early during RT, after
a dose of 20 to 25 Gy in 2 to 2.5 weeks and 2 cycles of
chemotherapy. MRIs were performed with a 1.5-Tesla
scanner and included sagittal T2-weighted imaging for
3D tumor volumetry measurement (Fig. 1) described in
detail earlier.24,28 DCE MRI was acquired for 158 to 168
seconds using a T1-weighted 3D gradient echo multislice
sequence (repetition time/echo time, 12 ms/5 ms; flip, 25
degrees; matrix, 138  256; partition, 12; number of excitations, 1; slab, 8.0 cm) after 3 precontrast baseline
acquisitions, and followed by a bolus of MRI contrast
agent (0.1 mmol/kg) at 5 mL/second. To cover the entire
tumor volume, the temporal resolution was reduced to 26
to 28 seconds, remaining appropriate for plateau phase
signal intensity (SI) assessment for each tumor voxel. The
patients’ therapy was not influenced by the MRI findings.
DCE Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis and 3D
Volumetry Analysis
The DCE MRI imaging data sets were analyzed using the
voxel-by-voxel analysis developed in our laboratory.26 After contouring of the tumor, a DCE time–SI curve was
generated for each voxel in the tumor as described in detail
earlier.26 SI voxel histograms (Fig. 1) of the voxel population within the entire 3D tumor region were generated to
derive the mean SI, median SI, variance, standard deviation, kurtosis of the SI distribution, and SI percentiles.
On the basis of our earlier exploratory study in a different
patient population,26 the 10th percentile of SI (SI[10%])
in the early therapy phase, representing the proportion of
low-perfusion regions within the heterogeneous tumor,
was the strongest predictor of tumor control. Residual 3D
tumor volume also showed a promising correlation with
tumor control.

Figure 1. (A) High dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2.5 weeks of chemotherapy/radiotherapy (RT) is shown. In this 52-year-old woman with stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, MRI was obtained 2.5
weeks after the initiation of RT at a dose of 21.6 grays (Gy) in 12 fractions and 2 cycles of weekly chemotherapy with cisplatin.
The volumetric MRI demonstrates the cervical tumor region (indicated by arrows). The DCE MRI shows intense heterogeneous
enhancement (indicated by arrows). The voxel histogram distribution of DCE demonstrates high and heterogeneous signal intensity (SI) of the tumor and a high lower 10th percentile of SI (SI[10%]) of 3.13. The patient was alive and well without primary tumor recurrence or metastasis at the time of last follow-up, 5 years and 2 months after the completion of therapy. (B) Low DCE
at 2.5 weeks of chemotherapy/RT is shown. In this 42-year-old woman with stage IIB adenocarcinoma of the cervix, MRI was
obtained 2.5 weeks after the initiation of RT at a dose of 21.6 Gy in 12 fractions and 2 cycles of weekly chemotherapy with cisplatin. The volumetric MRI demonstrates the cervical tumor region (indicated by arrows). The DCE MRI shows very low and heterogeneous enhancement (indicated by arrows). Voxel histogram distribution of DCE demonstrates overall much lower SI than in the
patient in shown in Panel A. The SI(10%) was 1.70. This patient had a recurrence of the primary tumor 1 month after the completion of therapy. Pelvic exenteration was attempted, but the tumor was unresectable and the patient died of cervical cancer 12
months later. U indicates uterus; B, bladder.

SI percentiles in increments of 2.5% from SI(2.5%)
to SI(40%) were generated to quantify the degree and proportion of the poorly perfused low-DCE components
within the tumor. An SI percentile was defined as the SI
value below which a given percentage of voxels within the
histogram falls; for example, SI(10%) is the SI value below
which the lowest 10% of voxels falls (Fig. 1). For volumetry, 3D volume measurement was performed for each sequential MRI by delineating the tumor on all the T2weighted images as described earlier.24,28
Outcome and Data Analysis
The outcome endpoint primary tumor recurrence (recurrence) was defined as tumor regrowth, persistence, or progression in the uterus or pelvis after completion of therapy.
Cancer death (death) was defined as death from cervical cancer or cancer complications. Patients were evaluated after

Cancer

therapy at 3-month to 12-month intervals until death or
data analysis. The median post-therapy follow-up of surviving patients was 4.1 years (range, 0.2-7.9 years).
The DCE MRI parameters identified in the SI voxel
histogram and 3D volume, and the clinical prognostic factors, were analyzed for their discriminating capacity in predicting recurrence versus tumor control and death versus
survival. Optimal SI percentile parameters across the range of
SI percentiles, and optimal parameter thresholds, were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
The threshold yielding the maximum Ji ¼ {sensitivityi
þ specificityi  1} for predicting disease recurrence, in which
i represents each possible threshold, was selected. These same
values were used as the threshold for cancer death sensitivity
and specificity analysis. Sensitivity was calculated as the number of predicted positives divided by the number of true-positives (7 recurrences and 14 deaths); specificity was calculated

Combined clinical prognostic factors consist of stage (I-II vs III-IV), lymph node involvement (uninvolved vs involved), and histology (squamous vs nonsquamous). Unfavorable factors are characterized by any of the following: lymph node involvement, stage III to IV, or nonsquamous histology. Favorable factors are
characterized by none of these.

as predicted negatives divided by true-negatives (55 recurrences and 48 deaths). Confidence intervals were calculated
from the exact binomial distribution.
A combined clinical prognostic factor parameter
categorized patients as unfavorable if they had at least 1 of
lymph node involvement, stage III or IV disease, or nonsquamous histology. Patients not fitting any of these 3 criteria
were categorized as favorable. Each clinical prognostic factor
was weighted equally. To evaluate the combination of MRI
parameters with and without clinical prognostic factors,
thresholds were determined from logistic regression models
for recurrence. The probability value generating the maximum {sensitivity þ specificity  1} for recurrence was
selected as the optimal threshold. Probabilities of disease recurrence and death were estimated based on the combined
SI(10%) and 3D volume thresholds.
Cox regression was used to confirm the predictive
significance of MRI parameters for the time to disease recurrence and time to death outcomes. MRI parameters

906

were evaluated as continuous variables; clinical prognostic
factor parameters were dichotomous. A 2-sided a-level of
.05 was used for the MRI parameters. No adjustments
for multiplicity were made because of the confirmatory
1-sided nature of the tests.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The distribution of stage, lymph node involvement, histology, and treatment variables is presented in Table 1. Tumor
characteristics were equally distributed with respect to treatment variables. Ten patients had FIGO stage IB2 (bulky), 7
had stage IIA, 26 had stage IIB, 2 had stage IIIA, 14 had
stage IIIB, and 3 had stage IVA tumors. The median age at
diagnosis was 53.3 years (range, 29-75 years).
Individual MRI Parameters
The overall results indicated that low-DCE patterns, indicative of poor tumor perfusion and hypoxia, and high

tumor volumes in the very early treatment phase (at 2-2.5
weeks of therapy) were associated with unfavorable therapy outcome, confirming the MRI parameters identified
in our exploratory study.26 Among the DCE parameters,
the heterogeneity-based SI percentile in the early treatment phase at 2 to 2.5 weeks of therapy provided the best
prediction of outcome. ROC analysis across the range of
SI percentiles demonstrated that SI(10%) had the highest
discriminating capacity (Fig. 2).

Figure 2. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of
signal intensity (SI) percentiles is shown. ROC analysis was
performed to determine the best SI percentile (SI[%]) for the
discrimination of disease recurrence (solid blue curve) and
cancer death (dashed red curve). Area under the curve values of SI(2.5%) to SI(30%) are above 0.70, thereby supporting the usefulness of the SI parameter across a range of
percentiles associated with low dynamic contrast-enhancement and indicative of poor perfusion and hypoxia. Consistent with the results of the exploratory study,26 SI(10%) shows
the best discriminating capacity.

Univariate Cox regression indicated that both
SI(10%) and tumor volume significantly correlated with
both time to disease recurrence and time to death. Lower
SI(10%) and higher volume were associated with higher
hazard ratios for recurrence (P ¼ .04 and P ¼ .03, respectively) and death (P ¼ .03 and P ¼ .01, respectively)
(Table 2). SI(10%) and volume remained significant predictors in a 3-parameter model containing SI(10%), volume, and the combined clinical prognostic factors for
recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-15.1 [P ¼ .02] and HR, 2.7; 95% CI,
1.2-6.0 [P ¼ .03], respectively) and for death (HR, 2.6;
95% CI, 1.2-5.6 [P ¼ .01] and HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7
[P ¼ .003], respectively). The correlation between
SI(10%) and 3D volume was .03, indicating minimal or
no overlap in the information provided by each.
Sensitivity and Specificity of Parameters
Threshold values for SI(10%) and 3D volume were
explored. The thresholds to discriminate patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome were equivalent to the lowest SI(10%) and the highest 3D volume values with no
recurrence event. This corresponds to the goal of maximizing
the sensitivity in predicting patients with unfavorable outcome, because these patients are the target group requiring
change in therapy strategy to improve outcome. On the basis
of this method, the discriminatory thresholds were 2.0 for
SI(10%) and 22 cm3 for 3D volume.
With these thresholds, the early therapy SI(10%)
<2.0 predicted recurrence and death with sensitivities of
100% and 79%, respectively (Table 3). The 3D volume
threshold of 22 cm3 predicted recurrence with the same

sensitivity but lower specificity than SI(10%), and death
with higher sensitivity, but lower specificity (Table 3).
The SI(10%) threshold of 2.0 in the current patient population was close to the threshold of 2.5 in our previous exploratory study.26 When applied to our current patients, the
prior threshold of 2.5 demonstrated sensitivities similar to
the 2.0 threshold, but inferior specificities for predicting disease recurrence and death (18% and 19%, respectively) (Table 3). The mean SI, averaging the SI values over the entire
tumor region without heterogeneity assessment, had lower
specificities (33% and 33%, respectively) than the heterogeneity-based SI(10%) (56% and 58%, respectively) in predicting recurrence and death (Table 3).
Comparison of the 2-Week to 2.5-Week Time
Point With Pretherapy MRI Parameters
MRI parameters at the early therapy time point were compared with pretherapy parameters using Cox regression.
Pretherapy SI(10%) was not found to be significantly associated with time to tumor recurrence (P ¼ .06) or death (P
¼ .08). Pretherapy tumor volume was associated with death
(P ¼ .02) but not recurrence (P ¼ .16). In the sensitivity

908

analysis, pretherapy tumor volume was found to be equivalent to early therapy volume for the prediction of recurrence,
with a sensitivity of 100% and a relatively low specificity of
42% in both the pretherapy and early therapy MRI. However, pretherapy volume was inferior in predicting death,
with a sensitivity of only 79%, compared with 93% for the
early therapy volume. Similarly, the SI(10%) in early therapy demonstrated better prediction. The sensitivities of the
early therapy SI(10%) in predicting recurrence and death
were 100% and 79%, respectively, compared with 71% and
43%, respectively, for the pretherapy SI(10%).
Combined Heterogeneity DCE and 3D
Volumetry Parameter (Combined MRI
Parameter)
The early therapy MRI-parameters, SI(10%) and 3D-volume, were combined to derive a combined MRI-parameter. It improved the outcome prediction over that of the
individual MRI parameters alone, resulting in a sensitivity
of 100% and specificity of 67% for predicting tumor recurrence, and a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 48%
for predicting death (Table 3).

For the combined MRI parameter, the estimated

and 0% (upper confidence limit, 28%) with neither parameter beyond threshold (Table 4). The probability of recurrence with both MRI parameters beyond thresholds was
37%. Kaplan-Meier estimate of actuarial 5-year local control rate (ie, freedom from recurrence) was 58%, 100%, and
100%, respectively, for both, 1, and neither parameter
beyond the threshold. The disease-specific and overall survival rates were 44%, 84%, and 100%, respectively, for
both, 1, and neither parameter beyond the threshold; and
44%, 81%, and 90%, respectively.
Combined Clinical Prognostic Factor/MRI
Predictive Assay
The combination of all the clinical prognostic factors and
the MRI-parameters was evaluated. For the individual
clinical prognostic factors (stage, lymph node status, and
histology), sensitivities were 50% (Table 3). The combined clinical prognostic factors were dichotomized into
unfavorable (any 1 of: stage III-IV disease, involved
lymph nodes, or nonsquamous histology) versus favorable
(none of these) categories.
Sensitivity/specificity analysis demonstrated that the
combination of the MRI parameters with clinical prognostic factors further increased the discriminating capacity. The
clinical prognostic factor/MRI predictive assay predicted all
recurrences (sensitivity, 100%) and improved specificity to
71% over the combined MRI parameter (67%) and combined clinical prognostic factor (51%) alone. It predicted
cancer death with the same sensitivity as the combined MRI
parameter alone (93%), and improved the specificity to

highest (42% and 67%, respectively) in patients with both
unfavorable MRI parameters and clinical prognostic factors,
and were 29% and 29%, respectively, in patients with
unfavorable MRI parameters despite favorable clinical prognostic factors (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Cervical cancer is a leading health problem worldwide.
Standard chemoradiation therapy fails in approximately
one-third of patients with stage IB2-IVA disease.29,30 The
classic prognostic factors, FIGO stage,1 lymph node status,2 and histology,3 have been well established to guide
therapy selection.31 However, they have been criticized as
suboptimal in predicting outcome in the individual
patient.4,5 Specifically, the gold standard clinical prognostic factors have not accounted for heterogeneity of tumor
responsiveness to the specific ongoing therapy, and have
not been able to reliably predict failure early during the
treatment course, when therapy adjustments are still feasible by radiation dose intensification, changes in the concurrent therapy, or addition of novel clinical trial
therapies.
Our research was intended to develop an early predictive assay for ultimate outcome by augmenting essential information from both the established clinical
prognostic factors and from predictive parameters for the
effectiveness of treatment. We took a new approach to
investigate parameters that reflect the effective delivery of
cytotoxic agents and oxygen to the heterogeneous tumor,
and, after delivery to the tumor, to assess the subtle early
response to the specific treatment regimen. Our current

study validates, with a different patient population and
refined imaging methods, 2 independent MRI parameters
as outcome predictors: the functional DCE parameter
SI(10%), first discovered in our exploratory pilot study,26
and the morphologic 3D volume parameter. SI(10%),
reflecting essential information on chemotherapy and oxygen delivery to the tumor, and residual 3D volume,
assessing early treatment response, predicted ultimate
treatment outcome at an ultra-early time point, within 2
to 2.5 weeks of the initiation of therapy.
Functional MRI: Heterogeneity-Based DCE
Parameter SI(10%)
The DCE parameter SI(10%), which provides a heterogeneity-based quantification of poorly perfused regions
within the tumor, was confirmed as a sensitive independent predictor of recurrence and cancer death (Fig. 1)
(Tables 2 and 3). This finding is in keeping with our premise that the tumor perfusion status during therapy,
which reflects the effectiveness of delivery of cytotoxic
agents and oxygen to the tumor, critically influences the
success of chemotherapy and RT. Poorly perfused cell
populations, represented by low-DCE regions within the
heterogeneous tumor, likely contribute critically to treatment failure. In cervical cancer, there is ample indirect evidence that poor tumor blood supply adversely affects
treatment response,14,15,17,18 and that hypoxia-imparted
radioresistance results in tumor recurrence and decreased
survival.13,16 Similarly, the effectiveness of chemotherapy
delivery to the tumor critically depends on adequate tumor perfusion.9,10 DCE MRI characterizes microvascular

910

structure and function,32,33 indirectly assesses perfusion
and oxygenation status,20,34,35 and correlates with microvessel density20 and with direct oxygen measurements22
in cervical cancer.
SI(10%), as developed in our laboratory, specifically
assessed the intratumoral heterogeneity of perfusion, a
well-known phenomenon in solid tumors11,12 that has
been most challenging to assess in clinical patients. Our
voxel-analysis identifies, separates, and analyzes the
heterogeneous low-perfusion (low-DCE) components
within the tumor.11 The clinical importance of heterogeneity assessment is shown by our result that SI(10%)
was far superior in predicting treatment failure than the
mean SI that averages DCE over the entire tumor
region (Table 3).
Morphologic MRI: 3D Volume and Combined
MRI Parameter
Whereas the functional parameter SI(10%) likely reflects
oxygen and chemotherapy delivery to the tumor during
therapy as a fundamental precondition for tumor cell kill
by a specific cytotoxic regimen, the improved volume
measurement by 3D volumetry can now detect the actual
early subtle response to the specific treatment in the individual patient. Irregular configurations and nonlinear
shrinkage of the individual tumor cannot be appreciated
by the traditional unidimensional or bidimensional tumor
measurements or by physical examination. With the
much higher precision of MRI23 and our measurement
methodology, high residual 3D volume assessed in early
therapy (2-2.5 weeks into treatment), independently

predicted recurrence and death with much better precision (Tables 2 and 3). By combining both, SI(10%) and
3D volume, assessing the effective delivery and the early
therapy response measure of the cytotoxic effect, respectively, the accuracy of the ultra-early outcome prediction
further improved over the individual MRI parameters
alone (Table 4). Such a new combined MRI predictor has
not been applied in clinical care for cervical cancer.
Comparison With the Exploratory Study
The present confirmatory study validates SI(10%) as a
predictive parameter, and further refines the SI(10%)
threshold. The threshold value of 2.0 in our current
patient population, separating favorable from unfavorable
outcome, approximates the SI(10%) of 2.5 from our exploratory study.26 The small difference between the current threshold and the pilot study is not unexpected, and
may be in part related to the larger patient number and
improved imaging technique of the current study population. However, the optimal threshold must be further
refined through future study.

Combined MRI/Clinical Prognostic Factor
Predictive Assay
SI(10%) and 3D volume were superior to clinical prognostic factors in predicting therapy outcome (Tables 2
and 3). This does not invalidate gold standard clinical
prognostic factors, but opens opportunities to augment
their prognostic abilities with the MRI parameters. Our
study explored this synergistic paradigm as a novel noninvasive MRI/clinical prognostic factor predictive assay by
using the MRI predictors as adjunctive independent information. This further improved prediction of treatment
failure to sensitivities of 100% and 93%, respectively, for
recurrence and death. With the MRI/clinical prognostic
factor predictive assay, probabilities of recurrence and
death (42% and 67%, respectively) were highest in
patients with both unfavorable clinical prognostic factors
and unfavorable MRI parameters, but were also substantial in those with unfavorable MRI parameters despite
favorable patient group based on clinical prognostic factors (29% and 29%, respectively) (Table 5). This suggests
that unfavorable MRI parameters identified a high-risk
subgroup within the favorable clinical prognostic factor
category. Despite the small size of the subgroups in this
exploratory analysis, these trends provide direction for
further study to validate the predictive assay and use it
clinically.

Although, to the best of our knowledge, the current
study has the largest patient population and longest follow-up time of its kind published to date, the confidence
intervals of our results were wide. However, the high sensitivity of 93% to 100% in predicting unfavorable outcome suggests that the combined clinical prognostic
factor/MRI predictive assay is a promising tool to effectively identify up front most patients who will ultimately
fail therapy. In this regard, the sensitivity to predict treatment failure may be the most important criteria. With the
poor salvage options after failed first-line therapy in cervical cancer, such timely prediction is critical. The early
availability of the predictive assay within 2 to 2.5 weeks of
the initiation of therapy can serve to further personalize
treatment strategies. This may profoundly impact therapy
success 3-fold. First, early prediction of ultimate failure of
ongoing standard therapy provides a window of opportunity to implement more intense treatment in those whose
high risk of failure justifies the toxicity of more aggressive
therapy. Second, prediction of success may avoid unnecessarily intense or experimental therapies in patients with low
risk of failure, thereby reducing morbidity and healthcare
cost. Third, incorporation of such refined predictive assays
into clinical trial designs can streamline patient selection and
improve efficacy of studies investigating novel therapies.
Our results support that this novel noninvasive
approach is achievable in a 45-minute MRI that can be
implemented in community clinical settings to allow
broad patient access.
In conclusion, the results of the current study confirm the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of 2 independent MRI parameters, quantifying heterogeneous
tumor perfusion and early therapy-specific 3D volume
response, for predicting recurrence and death in patients
with cervical cancer. The combined predictive powers of
the pretreatment clinical prognostic factors and the independent early therapy MRI parameters can be used as a
novel predictive assay for ultimate outcome of the specific
ongoing treatment regimen, and may have profound
impact to personalize therapy strategies in cervical cancer.
