Abstract
The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand, stromal cell–
derived factor-1 (SDF-1), play important roles in hematopoiesis regulation, lymphocyte activation, and trafficking, as well
as in developmental processes, including organogenesis,
vascularization, and embryogenesis. The receptor is also
involved in HIV infection and tumor growth and metastasis.
Antagonists of CXCR4 have been widely evaluated for drugs
against HIV and tumors. In an effort to identify novel CXCR4
antagonists, we screened a small library of compounds
derived from marine organisms and found bryostatin-5, which
potently inhibits chemotaxis induced by SDF-1 in Jurkat cells.
Bryostatin-5 is a member of the macrolactones, and its
analogue bryostatin-1 is currently being evaluated in clinical
trials for its chemotherapeutic potential. The involvement of
bryostatins in the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling process has never
been reported. In this study, we found that bryostatin-5
potently inhibits SDF-1–induced chemotaxis but does not
affect serum-induced chemotaxis. Further studies indicate
that this inhibitory effect is not due to receptor antagonism
but rather to bryostatin-5–induced receptor desensitization
and down-regulation of cell surface CXCR4. We also show that
these effects are mediated by the activation of conventional
protein kinase C. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8678–86]

Introduction
Chemokines are a family of structurally related glycoproteins
with potent leukocyte activation and/or chemotactic activity. They
are divided into four subfamilies (C, CC, CXC, and CX3C) based on
the arrangement of their first two conserved cysteine residues at
the amino terminus (1). Stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1;
CXCL12) is a member of the CXC chemokine subfamily, and it
seems to be the only ligand for chemokine receptor CXCR4. CXCR4
belongs to the superfamily of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR).
CXCR4 is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of tissues and
cell types, including various subtypes of leukocytes, hematopoietic
progenitor cells, and nonhematopoietic cells, such as endothelial
and epithelial cells (2). The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays important and
unique roles in hematopoiesis regulation, lymphocyte activation,
and trafficking, as well as in developmental processes, such as

organogenesis, vascularization, and embryogenesis (3–5). CXCR4 is
also one of the principal coreceptors for CD4-mediated HIV
infection of T cells (6).
CXCR4 is also involved in the growth and metastasis of various
types of cancers. At least 23 different types of human cancers,
including hematopoietic and solid tumors, overexpress CXCR4 (7),
and cancer cells with higher levels of CXCR4 show greater
incidence of metastasis (8–10). The CXCR4 antagonist AMD 3100
has been reported to inhibit intracranial growth of primary brain
tumors (11), whereas the antagonist T140 effectively inhibited
pulmonary metastasis of human breast cancer cells in SCID mice
(12). Other studies have indicated roles for SDF-1/CXCR4 in the
metastasis of neuroblastoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer cells
(13–15). These findings implicate the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in a
variety of cancers, which may make this pathway an interesting
target for the development of drugs against cancer and HIV.
To identify antagonists of this signaling pathway, we screened a
small library of compounds derived from marine organisms
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) and found a class of macrolactones,
bryostatins, with potent inhibitory activity against SDF-1–induced
chemotaxis in a human acute T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat).
Jurkat cells have high endogenous levels of CXCR4. Bryostatins were
first isolated from the marine organism Bugula neritina. Currently,
>20 natural bryostatins are known. Bryostatin-1 is the most well
studied, as it possesses a unique pharmacologic profile as a cancer
chemotherapeutic agent and inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and
angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (16–18). Bryostatin-1 is currently
being evaluated alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in >40 clinical trials for numerous cancer types,
including melanoma, myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, AIDS-related lymphoma, breast cancer, and
non–small cell lung cancers (19, 20). The primary mechanism by
which bryostatins suppress tumor growth is believed to involve
modulation of conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC)
activities. These activities induce tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)
expression and activation of extrinsic apoptotic cascades, such
as increasing the release of cytochrome c mediated by 1-h-Darabinofuranosyl cytosine and altering the phosphorylation status
of Bcl-2 (21, 22). However, the exact mechanisms of bryostatins in
inhibiting tumor metastasis remain to be elucidated.
Bryostatin-5 has a very similar structure to bryostatin-1
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). It inhibits the growth of murine
melanoma K1735-M2 similar to bryostatin-1 but with fewer side
effects in animal experiments (17). Thus far, no study has addressed
the involvement of bryostatins in SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling processes. Understanding this involvement may help explain the inhibitory
effects of bryostatins on cancer cell metastasis. In this study, we
report that bryostatin-5 can potently inhibit SDF-1–induced
chemotaxis in Jurkat cells, as well as in Chinese hamster ovary

Bryostatin-5 Blocks SDF-1/CXCR4-Mediated Chemotaxis

Fig. 1. Bryostatin-5 inhibits SDF-1–
induced chemotaxis but not [35S]GTPgS

with the indicated concentrations
of bryostatin-5 or T140 for 15 min.
Chemotaxis was then induced using
30 nmol/L SDF-1. Both bryostatin-5 and
T140 inhibit SDF-1–induced chemotaxis in
a dose-dependent manner. B, bryostatin-5

chemotaxis in CHO cells stably expressing
CXCR4 at concentrations as low as
2 nmol/L. C, bryostatin-5 does not inhibit
10% FBS–induced chemotaxis in CHO
cells stably expressing CXCR4. Columns,

SDF-1–induced binding of [35S]GTPgS in a

no effect on SDF-1–induced binding of
[35S]GTPgS at concentrations up to
1 Amol/L. Representative of two independent
experiments, each carried out in triplicate.

(CHO) cells, stably expressing human CXCR4, but no effect is
observed on serum-induced chemotaxis. Further studies indicate
that this inhibitory effect is not due to receptor antagonism but
rather to desensitization and down-regulation of cell surface
CXCR4 induced by bryostatin-5. These effects are reversible, and
they are mediated by activation of conventional PKCs.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. A mammalian expression vector encoding Ga16 was
purchased from the UMR cDNA Resource Center. A plasmid encoding
N-terminal myc-tagged CXCR4 was kindly provided by Dr. Gang Pei
(Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences). Human SDF-1 and T140 were
synthesized by GL Biochem. Hoechst 33342 and sulfinpyrazone were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PKC inhibitors GF109203X and rottlerin
were obtained from Calbiochem. PKC~ antibody (C20) was obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and all other antibodies against PKC isoforms,
phosphorylated PKC isoforms, h-actin, myc-tag (9B11), and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated antirabbit IgG were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology. Donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa
Fluor 488, donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555, and
Fluo-4 AM were purchased from Invitrogen. FlashBlue GPCR scintillation
beads and [35S]GTPgS were obtained from PerkinElmer.
Cells culture and transfection. Jurkat and CHO-K1 cells obtained from
American Type Culture Collection were maintained in RPMI 1640 and F12
medium (Life Technologies), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 100 mg/L penicillin, and 100 mg/L
streptomycin at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. CHO-K1
cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding CXCR4 and Ga16 by
electroporation. To generate stable cell lines, transfected cells were seeded
into 10-cm dishes and 1 mg/mL G418 and 40 Ag/mL blasticidin were added
to the culture medium 24 h later. The selection medium was changed every
3 d until colonies formed. A single colony was isolated, expanded, and
tested with calcium mobilization assay to confirm the expression and
proper function of the transfected genes.
Chemotaxis assay. Jurkat cells were collected by centrifugation and
resuspended to a density of 1.0  106/mL in RPMI 1640 supplemented with

2.5% FBS. The cells were preincubated with various compounds for 15 min,
and then 100 AL of the cells were added to the upper chamber of a 24-well
transwell plate (6.5-mm diameter, 5-Am pore size; Corning) whereas the
lower chamber received the same medium supplemented with 30 nmol/L
SDF-1. The wells were incubated for 5 h at 37jC in 5% CO2. Cells that had
traversed the membrane to the lower chamber were collected and stained
with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 and then counted with an ArrayScan
4.0 HCS reader (Cellomics).
CHO cells stably transfected with CXCR4 were collected by centrifugation
and resuspended to a density of 2.0  106/mL in F12 medium containing
0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were preincubated with various
compounds for 15 min, and then 50 AL of the cells were added to the
upper chamber of a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (AP48, Neuro Probe)
containing 5-Am pore polycarbonate membranes. SDF-1 (100 nmol/L,
25 AL) was added to the lower chamber, and the wells were incubated for
5 h at 37jC in 5% CO2. Nonmigrated cells on the upper side of the
membrane were wiped off with a blade, and the membrane with migrated
cells on the other side were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with
0.5% crystal violet. The membranes were scanned, and chemotaxis index
was calculated as the staining density of the cells that migrated toward
medium containing SDF-1 divided by the staining density of cells that
migrated toward medium without SDF-1.
[35S]GTP;S binding assay. Cell membranes were isolated as previously
described (23). Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended
in lysis buffer [5 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 5 mmol/L EGTA
(pH 7.5)]. Next, cells were homogenized, and crude membranes were
pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 15 min at 4jC. The membranes
were resuspended in reaction buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES, 100 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2 (pH 7.4)], and the protein concentration was determined.
The exchange of [35S]GTPgS was measured using a scintillation proximity
assay, as described previously (24). The reaction was carried out at 30jC for
3 h in 100 AL reaction buffer containing 5 Ag membrane, 100 Ag FlashBlue
GPCR beads, 10 Amol/L GDP, 10 Ag/mL saponin, 0.2 nmol/L [35S]GTPgS,
10 nmol/L SDF-1, and the indicated concentration of compounds. To
measure nonspecific binding, 2 Amol/L GTPgS were added. Membranebound [35S]GTPgS was detected with a Microbeta scintillation counter
(PerkinElmer).

Calcium mobilization assay. CHO cells stably expressing CXCR4 and
Ga16 were loaded with 2 Amol/L Fluo-4 AM in HBSS at 37jC for 45 min.
After thorough washing with assay buffer, 50 AL of HBSS containing either
antagonists or 1% DMSO (negative control) were added. After incubation
at room temperature for 10 min, 25 AL of SDF-1 were dispensed into the
well using a FlexStation II microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and
intracellular calcium change was recorded at an excitation wavelength of
485 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.
Western blot. CHO cells stably expressing CXCR4 and Ga16 were serumstarved for 24 h and then treated with various concentrations of bryostatin5 or SDF-1 for 15 min at 37jC. Cells were lysed, sonicated, and boiled at 95
to 100jC for 5 min in sample buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 2% w/v SDS,
10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% bromophenyl blue (pH 6.8)]. Aliquots
(20 Ag) of proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The
membranes were first incubated with blocking buffer (TBS with 0.05%
Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated
overnight at 4jC in buffer containing anti–h-actin (1:1,500) and anti-PKC
antibodies (1:1,500). The membranes were washed thrice and incubated
with goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:5,000) for 1 h. After washing,
immunostaining was visualized using Amersham ECL Plus Western blotting
detection reagents (GE Healthcare).
Immunofluorescence microscopy. CHO cells stably expressing
N-terminal myc-tagged CXCR4 and Ga16 were seeded onto 96-well plates
at a density of 3  104 per well. After overnight incubation, cells were
treated with GF109203X at 37jC for 15 min and then stimulated with
200 nmol/L SDF-1, bryostatin-5, or 1% DMSO (negative control) at 37jC
for the indicated time. After fixation with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and
permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100, cells were incubated overnight
with antibodies against the myc epitope or PKCa (1:200) at 4jC. To stain
cell surface receptors, the Triton X-100 permeabilization step was omitted.
On the next day, cells were washed and incubated with the appropriate
secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 for 1.5 h at room
temperature. Finally, cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 for 10 min
at room temperature. Fluorescent images were obtained with an Olympus
IX51 inverted fluorescent microscope. The fluorescent intensity of the
nonpermeabilized cells was measured with a Cellomics ArrayScan 4.0 HCS
Reader, which can automatically identify and outline each cell. Experiments
were run in triplicate, and f1,000 cells from each well were analyzed.
Data analysis. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad). Nonlinear regression analyses were performed to generate
dose-response curves and calculate EC50 or IC50 values. Mean F SE was
calculated automatically using this software. Two-tailed Student’s t tests
were performed to determine statistically significant differences.

ing CXCR4 (Fig. 1B) but did not inhibit chemotaxis of CHO cells
induced by 10% FBS even at a high concentration (10 nmol/L;
Fig. 1C). No significant change in cell viability was detected after
exposure to 10 nmol/L bryostatin-5 for 24 hours (data not shown).
These results indicate that bryostatin-5 specifically inhibits SDF-1–
induced chemotaxis.

Results
Bryostatin-5 inhibits SDF-1–induced chemotaxis of Jurkat
cells. To determine the specific roles of bryostatin-5 in cancer cell
metastasis mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4, we investigated its effects
on chemotaxis of Jurkat cells, a human T leukemia cell line that is
reported to express abundant CXCR4 receptor and shows
chemotaxis when exposed to SDF-1 (25, 26). As shown in Fig. 1A,
pretreating the cells with bryostatin-5 blocked the chemotaxis of
Jurkat cells toward SDF-1 in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 =
0.6 nmol/L), whereas bryostatin-5 alone did not induce Jurkat cell
chemotaxis (Supplementary Fig. S1B). T140, a specific antagonist of
CXCR4 (27), also blocked SDF-1–induced chemotaxis in Jurkat cells
(Fig. 1A). We also found that bryostatin-1 blocks SDF-1–induced
chemotaxis in Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an
IC50 value of 0.9 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Because we had
only limited amounts of bryostatin-1, further studies were
performed with bryostatin-5.
At concentrations as low as 2 nmol/L, bryostatin-5 completely
inhibited SDF-1–induced chemotaxis in CHO cells stably express-

30 nmol/L SDF-1 after 20 min. The initial stimulation of SDF-1 increases the
intracellular calcium level, whereas bryostatin-5 has no such effect. Cells

the second stimulation with SDF-1, indicating CXCR4 desensitization.

Bryostatin-5 inhibits SDF-1–induced calcium response but
not [35S]GTP;S binding. To explore the direct effects of
bryostatin-5 on SDF-1–induced G-protein activation, we used a
cell-free system, namely the [35S]GTPgS binding scintillation
proximity assay. The EC50 of SDF-1 obtained from this assay was
1.77 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1C), which agrees well with
previously reported values (28). The CXCR4 antagonist T140
potently inhibited G-protein activation induced by 10 nmol/L of
SDF-1 (IC50 = 3.2 nmol/L), whereas bryostatin-5 had no effect
at any of the concentrations tested from 0.0001 to 1,000 nmol/L
(Fig. 1D).
Next, we tested the effect of bryostatin-5 on the SDF-1–induced
calcium response in CHO cells stably expressing CXCR4 and Ga16.

Ga16 is a G protein that greatly enhances the coupling of GPCRs to
the PLC pathway, thus augmenting calcium response (29, 30). Cells
were first stimulated with either 30 nmol/L SDF-1 or bryostatin-5,
whereas exposure to 1% DMSO served as the negative control
(Fig. 2A, first arrow). SDF-1 induced a strong calcium response,
whereas bryostatin-5 failed to cause any change in the intracellular
calcium level. Cells were then washed and restimulated after
20 min with 30 nmol/L SDF-1 (Fig. 2A, second arrow). Prestimulation with both SDF-1 and bryostatin-5 led to receptor desensitization, i.e., reduced calcium response at the second stimulation
with SDF-1. In a dose-response experiment, both bryostatin-5
(Fig. 2B) and bryostatin-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2C) potently
inhibited calcium signaling induced by 30 nmol/L SDF-1, with IC50

values of 17.9 and 13.7 nmol/L, respectively. However, bryostatin-5
only partially desensitized the y-opioid receptor and CCR5
chemokine receptor even at micromolar concentrations (data not
shown). A kinetic analysis (Fig. 2C) revealed that this inhibition was
time-dependent (t 1/2, f50 seconds), indicating that a short period
of pretreatment was necessary for desensitization. These data
indicate that bryostatin-5 does not antagonize CXCR4 but rather
induces CXCR4 desensitization in a time- and dose-dependent
manner.
Bryostatin-5 induces down-regulation of cell surface but not
total CXCR4. Receptor internalization is a common phenomenon
after GPCR stimulation, and it plays important roles in receptor
desensitization and resensitization (31, 32). To explore the effects
of bryostatin-5 on CXCR4 internalization, we investigated the levels
of CXCR4 on the cell surface and inside the cell after stimulation of
200 nmol/L SDF-1 and bryostatin-5 using immunofluorescent
staining in nonpermeabilized (Fig. 3A) or permeabilized cells
(Fig. 3B). In nonpermeabilized cells, antibody staining only revealed

cell surface CXCR4. Treatment with SDF-1 and bryostatin-5
significantly reduced the amount of CXCR4 on the cell surface.
Statistical analysis of fluorescent intensity revealed an f30%
reduction in CXCR4 levels on the cell surface after 30 to 60 minutes
of stimulation with SDF-1 or bryostatin-5. Staining with permeabilized cells revealed internalized receptors after stimulation
(Fig. 3B). Additional results from Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C
and D ) indicated different fates of internalized receptors.
Prolonged stimulation by SDF-1 caused a reduction in total CXCR4
(Fig. 3C), indicating degradation of the internalized receptors.
However, bryostatin-5 did not alter total CXCR4 levels even after
24-hour incubation (Fig. 3D). This indicates the involvement of a
receptor recycling pathway.
Bryostatin-5 activates conventional and novel PKC isoforms
but not atypical PKCs. PKC is one of the major protein kinases
responsible for heterologous desensitization of many GPCRs
(33, 34), including CXCR4 (35). Because bryostatin-1 is reported
to activate various isoforms of PKC, we examined the function of

resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with subtype-specific antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed after densitometric scanning of films.
Both SDF-1 and bryostatin-5 strongly induce conventional PKC phosphorylation (B), although they only moderately induce phosphorylation of novel PKC (C ). Neither
SDF-1 nor bryostatin-5 induces phosphorylation of atypical PKC isoform PKC~/E (D). Insulin was used as a positive control to stimulate PKC~/E phosphorylation.

PKCs, enhances SDF-1–induced calcium elevation and chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner. It also reverses the inhibitory effect of bryostatin-5 (Bryo 5) on
SDF-1–induced calcium response and chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner. B, rottlerin, a selective inhibitor for the novel PKC isoform PKCy, has no effect on
SDF-1–induced calcium response and chemotaxis. Similarly, it does not reverse the inhibitory effects of bryostatin-5 on SDF-1–induced calcium response and
chemotaxis. C, GF109203X (1 Amol/L) partially inhibits SDF-1–induced CXCR4 internalization and significantly inhibits bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 internalization.

bryostatin-5 on PKC activation. Translocation and phosphorylation
of PKC allow us to detect PKC activation after stimulation.
Immunofluorescent staining revealed that PKCa can rapidly
translocate to the cell membrane after only 5 minutes of exposure
to bryostatin-5 (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis was applied to study
bryostatin-5–induced PKC phosphorylation. CHO cells stably
expressing CXCR4 were treated with DMSO, SDF-1 (1 Amol/L), or
bryostatin-5 (0.01, 0.1, and 1 Amol/L) for 15 minutes. Cell lysates
were resolved with SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation levels of
the various PKC isoforms were determined using subtype-specific
antibodies. We used an antibody specific to a phosphorylation site
at the carboxy-terminal residue homologous to Ser660 of PKCh,
which has been shown to detect primarily the a and h isoforms of
PKC. We found that bryostatin-5 induced a strong, dose-dependent
phosphorylation of conventional PKC (Fig. 4B).
Antibodies against phosphorylated PKCy/u (Ser643/676) and
phosphorylated PKC~/E (Thr410/403) were used to detect novel
and atypical PKC phosphorylation. Novel PKC isoforms were found
to be moderately, but significantly, phosphorylated in response to
bryostatin-5 (Fig. 4C), although phosphorylation levels of atypical
PKC isoforms were unaffected (Fig. 4D). SDF-1 treatment resulted
in a PKC activation pattern similar to that in response to
bryostatin-5 treatment. These results indicate that bryostatin-5
activates conventional and novel PKCs but not atypical PKCs.
Bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 desensitization and internalization are mediated by conventional PKC isoforms. Several
PKC inhibitors were studied to explore the link between bryostatin5–induced activation of PKC, CXCR4 desensitization, and inhibition
of chemotaxis mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4. GF109203X, an inhibitor
of both conventional and novel PKCs, enhanced SDF-1–induced
calcium elevation and chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). This indicates that SDF-1–induced CXCR4 desensitization
is partially due to the activation of conventional and novel PKCs.

www.aacrjournals.org

GF109203X also reversed, in a dose-dependent manner, the inhibitory effect of bryostatin-5 on SDF-1–induced calcium response and
chemotaxis (Fig. 5A). In addition, at concentration of 1 Amol/L,
GF109203X partially inhibited SDF-1–induced CXCR4 internalization. This same concentration of GF109203X almost completely
inhibited CXCR4 internalization induced by bryostatin-5 (Fig. 5C).
These results indicate that PKC activation is a critical step in
bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 desensitization and inhibition of
chemotaxis mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4.
To further clarify which PKC isoforms are involved in bryostatin5–induced CXCR4 desensitization, rottlerin, a selective inhibitor
of the novel PKC isoform PKCy, was used (36, 37). Rottlerin was
found to have no effect on SDF-1–induced calcium response and
chemotaxis at concentrations up to 20 Amol/L. Similarly, it had
no effect on the inhibition by bryostatin-5 of SDF-1–induced
calcium response and chemotaxis (Fig. 5B). These data reveal that
bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 desensitization and internalization
is mediated primarily by conventional PKC isoforms.
Bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 desensitization and internalization are reversible. Although both SDF-1 and bryostatin-5
induce receptor desensitization and internalization, Western blot
analysis of whole cell lysates (Fig. 3C and D) revealed different fates
for receptors internalized in response to different stimuli.
Bryostatin-5, unlike SDF-1, did not cause a reduction in total
CXCR4 levels even after a 24-hour incubation. These results imply
that bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 desensitization and internalization are reversible. Therefore, we performed a long-term desensitization assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, SDF-1–induced desensitization
was irreversible. This was consistent with the Western blot results,
which showed that long-term exposure to SDF-1 caused a
reduction in the total levels of CXCR4 (Fig. 3C).
In contrast, byrostatin-5–induced desensitization reversed after
f7 hours despite the continued presence of the compound in the

culture medium (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescent staining also
revealed that the loss of cell surface CXCR4 induced by SDF-1
was persistent, whereas the receptor internalization induced by
bryostatin-5 reversed after a long-term treatment (Fig. 6B). These
reversible effects are likely due to the down-regulation of
conventional and novel PKC isoforms after a long-term treatment
with bryostatin-5 (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Bryostatins are macrolactones isolated from marine organisms.
Of the >20 known bryostatins, bryostatin-1 is the best characterized.
Bryostatin-1 potently inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and
angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (16–18), and it is currently being
evaluated in clinical studies for its therapeutic potential against
various types of cancer (19, 20). A variety of studies have been
performed to better understand the molecular mechanisms of
tumor suppression induced by bryostatin-1 (21, 22, 38). These
studies revealed that bryostatin-1 binds to the phorbol ester/
diacylglycerol-responsive C1 domain of certain PKC isoforms and
activates them. This activation of PKC leads to downstream changes
in apoptosis-related proteins and pathways, including overexpression of TNF-a and altered Bcl-2 phosphorylation (21, 22), which
culminate in tumor cell growth inhibition and death. However, the
specific pathways involved in bryostatin-induced metastasis
inhibition remain largely unknown. The present study is the first,
to our knowledge, that identifies bryostatin-5 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), an analogue of bryostatin-1, as a potent inhibitor of
chemotaxis mediated by SDF-1 and CXCR4. This may help to
explain the inhibitory effect of bryostatins on tumor metastasis.
Metastasis continues to be the leading cause of mortality for
cancer patients. It is a highly organized, nonrandom, and organselective process (39, 40). It involves several sequential steps,
including detachment of tumor cells from the primary site,
intravasation to vascular or lymphatic vessels, migration to remote
sites, adhesion to microvessel walls, and extravasation into target
tissue (41–43). A number of molecules have been implicated in
cancer metastasis, including the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor
CXCR4. Chemokines are small, proinflammatory chemoattractant
cytokines that bind to G protein–coupled seven-transmembrane
receptors that regulate cellular trafficking (32). SDF-1 and CXCR4
were originally characterized as playing important roles in
hematopoiesis regulation, lymphocyte activation, and trafficking,
as well as in developmental processes, such as organogenesis,
vascularization, and embryogenesis (3–5). However, recent studies
indicate that CXCR4 is overexpressed in >20 different types of
human cancers, including hematopoietic and solid tumors (7); in
fact, higher levels of CXCR4 expression correlate with higher
incidence of metastasis and poor prognosis (8–10). In animal
studies, the CXCR4 antagonist T140 has been shown to inhibit
pulmonary metastasis of human breast cancer cells (10). These
findings indicate that compounds able to block the SDF-1/CXCR4
interaction or SDF-1–induced chemotaxis may inhibit metastasis of
tumor cells and, therefore, be effective anticancer agents.
In a search for new CXCR4 antagonists derived from marine
organisms, we identified bryostatin-5, which potently inhibited
SDF-1–induced chemotaxis in Jurkat cells and CHO cells expressing human CXCR4. We believe that this inhibitory effect is related
to CXCR4 rather than to downstream factors involved in
cytoskeletal rearrangement, because bryostatin-5 did not inhibit
FBS-induced chemotaxis in CHO cells (Fig. 1A–C). These promising

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

results led us to speculate that bryostatin-5 might be the first
representative of a new class of CXCR4 antagonists. However, we
were surprised to find that bryostatin-5 did not block SDF-1–
induced G-protein activation in the GTPgS binding experiment
with membranes containing CXCR4 (Fig. 1D). This result suggests
that bryostatin-5 failed to inhibit binding of SDF-1 to CXCR4 and
the subsequent G-protein activation.
Receptor desensitization is another possibility that might cause
the loss of function in GPCRs (44). We therefore tested whether

Bryostatin-5 Blocks SDF-1/CXCR4-Mediated Chemotaxis

bryostatin-5 can induce CXCR4 desensitization using a calcium flux
assay. As predicted, bryostatin-5 caused dose-dependent and timedependent desensitization of CXCR4 (Fig. 2). Previous work has
shown that receptor internalization also plays important roles
in receptor desensitization and resensitization (31, 32). Using
immunocytochemical staining to detect surface and intracellular
CXCR4, we discovered that bryostatin-5 induces CXCR4 internalization (Fig. 3A and B). These data indicate that bryostatin-5
inhibits SDF-1–mediated chemotaxis not by blocking the CXCR4
receptor but by causing its desensitization and internalization.
Desensitization of receptors, initiated by their phosphorylation,
is an important regulatory step in GPCR-mediated signaling. There
are two major types of GPCR desensitization. Firstly, heterologous
desensitization is mediated by phosphorylation of the receptor by
second messenger–dependent protein kinases, such as PKA and
PKC. Secondly, homologous desensitization is mediated by
phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein–coupled receptor
kinases (GRK) and subsequent binding of h-arrestins (45–47).
Because PKC is reported to be activated and causes desensitization
in many GPCRs, including CXCR4, after ligand binding (33–35, 48),
we tested whether bryostatin-5 induces CXCR4 desensitization and
internalization by activating PKC isozymes. PKC translocation and
phosphorylation are common methods for detecting PKC activation. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that PKCa translocated toward the plasma membrane after 5 minutes of treatment
with bryostatin-5. Western blot analysis indicated that bryostatin-5
strongly stimulated the phosphorylation of conventional PKC
isoforms in a dose-dependent manner. It also moderately activated
novel PKC isoforms, although it had no effect on atypical PKC.
SDF-1, the native ligand of CXCR4, showed an activation pattern of
PKC isoforms very similar to that of bryostatin-5 (Fig. 4).
To further verify the involvement of PKC in bryostatin-5–
induced CXCR4 desensitization and internalization, two PKC
inhibitors were studied. GF109203X, an inhibitor of both conventional and novel PKCs, reversed bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4
internalization at a concentration of 1 Amol/L (Fig. 5C). It also
reversed the inhibitory effect of bryostatin-5 on SDF-1–induced
calcium response and chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). However, rottlerin, a selective inhibitor for the novel PKC
isoform PKCy, failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of bryostatin-5
on SDF-1–induced calcium response and chemotaxis (Fig. 5B).
These results indicate that bryostatin-5–induced CXCR4 desensitization and internalization are mediated primarily by the
activation of conventional PKC isoforms. In contrast, SDF-1–
induced desensitization of CXCR4 involved both homologous and
heterologous components. This explains why GF109203X enhanced
SDF-1–induced calcium response and chemotaxis because it
blocked the heterologous desensitization component, whereas it

only partially reversed the receptor internalization induced by
SDF-1 because it was unable to block the homologous desensitization mediated by GRK. Rottlerin did not affect SDF-1–induced
calcium response and chemotaxis, indicating that the heterologous
component of SDF-1–induced CXCR4 desensitization is due
primarily to conventional PKC isoforms.
Interestingly, although both SDF-1 and bryostatin-5 induced
receptor desensitization and internalization, Western blot analysis
of whole cell lysates (Fig. 3C and D) indicated different fates for
receptors internalized in response to the two stimuli. CXCR4
internalized after the stimulation of SDF-1 underwent a degradation pathway because the long-term treatment of SDF-1 caused
down-regulation of total CXCR4. In contrast, bryostatin-5 failed to
alter total CXCR4 levels even after a 24-hour incubation, indicating
the involvement of a receptor recycling pathway. These results
imply that bryostatin-5–induced receptor desensitization and
internalization are reversible. Indeed, long-term treatment assays
revealed that bryostatin-5, but not SDF-1, induced reversible
CXCR4 desensitization and internalization (Fig. 6A and B). Longterm treatment of bryostatin-5 has previously been reported to
down-regulate conventional and novel PKCs (49, 50), and our data
confirm this finding (Fig. 6C). The down-regulation of conventional
PKC isoform is likely involved in the reversible effects of
bryostatin-5 because it is the major PKC isoform regulating CXCR4
desensitization.
In summary, we report, for the first time, that bryostatin-5
potently inhibits chemotaxis mediated by SDF-1 and CXCR4. Our
results reveal that this inhibitory effect is not due to blockade of
CXCR4 but rather to the desensitization and internalization of this
receptor. Bryostatin-5 induces the desensitization and internalization of CXCR4 primarily by activating conventional PKC isoforms.
Our results gave light to a new mechanism that might lead to a
better understanding of the therapeutic effect of bryostatin-5 in
cancer treatment.
