Abstract
Although trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an important advance in
the treatment of breast cancer, a significant proportion of
patients do not respond to trastuzumab either alone or in
combination with chemotherapy. In this study, we observe
that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER3
expression is substantially increased after long-term trastuzumab exposure of HER2-positive breast carcinoma–derived
cell lines that show primary resistance to trastuzumab.
Furthermore, long-term trastuzumab exposure of trastuzumab-resistant cell lines induces de novo sensitivity to the
EGFR-targeted agents gefitinib or cetuximab in two of three
cell lines accompanied by increased EGFR expression.
Together, these results indicate that primary trastuzumab
resistance is not synonymous with lack of responsiveness to
trastuzumab and, importantly, suggest that trastuzumab
priming may sensitize trastuzumab-resistant tumors to other
HER family-directed therapeutics. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2191–4]

Introduction
Biologically targeted cancer therapeutics coupled with in vitro
theragnostics have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of
cancer patients. Personalized therapy for each cancer patient is
now within our reach through genomic, transcriptomic, and
proteomic profiling of the patient’s tumor and normal tissues,
yielding theragnostic information that can be used to target the
specific phenotype of a cancer cell. The advent of ‘‘personalized’’
cancer therapies, through the introduction of drugs such as
imatinib (Gleevec) for the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML), and trastuzumab (Herceptin) for the treatment
of both early and advanced stage HER2-positive breast cancer has
revolutionized the treatment of these diseases. Unfortunately,
acquired resistance to these two new classes of biologically
targeted therapeutics is frequently seen in the advanced disease
setting, and in a small proportion of early stage patients after
adjuvant therapy (1, 2). Although the molecular basis of acquired
resistance to imatinib has been determined, and new drugs have
now been engineered to overcome acquired imatinib resistance (3),
our understanding of trastuzumab resistance is still in its infancy.

This is somewhat surprising given that imatinib received Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval more recently than trastuzumab, and that many more patients afflicted with breast cancer than
CML are available to study acquired resistance to these drugs
in clinical trials. One potential reason for the delay in the
development of our understanding of trastuzumab resistance is
the controversy that has surrounded the coupling of diagnostics to
the selection of appropriately responsive breast cancer patients for
trastuzumab treatment, in contrast to the identification of CML
patients responsive to imatinib treatment based on the characteristic Philadelphia chromosome. Only one study has examined the
molecular basis of secondary or acquired trastuzumab resistance
(4). A second recent study suggests that primary Herceptin
sensitivity can be overcome by activation of the hepatocyte growth
factor receptor Met (5). In contrast, limited information is available
regarding the basis for primary trastuzumab resistance in breast
cancer patients.
Understanding primary trastuzumab resistance is particularly
important for breast cancer patients because only f30% of
patients selected for treatment (on the basis of positive HER2
expression) respond to trastuzumab monotherapy, and a significant proportion of patients also show primary resistance to
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy regimens (6). Our inability to
effectively stratify patients for trastuzumab therapy using currently
available theragnostic biomarkers such as HER2 highlights the
need for better predictors of therapeutic responsiveness. The
clinical effect and limitations of HER2 testing is further
underscored by a recent report demonstrating that even patients
with low HER2 expression can benefit from trastuzumab treatment
(7). Continued research to improve the selection of breast cancer
patients for trastuzumab therapy is clearly warranted and urgently
needed.
Conventional wisdom defines primary (or de novo) resistance to
a given drug as a lack of some measurable (tumor) response such
as cell proliferation, which connotes lack of drug activity. In the
studies presented here, we show for the first time that breast
cancer cells exhibiting primary resistance to trastuzumab are in
fact, not only responsive to trastuzumab activity but are responsive
in ways that may establish vulnerability to other classes of existing
cancer therapeutics, such as some of the other biologically directed
HER family inhibitors. This Kuhnian observation is in contrast to
existing assumptions regarding the ability of HER2-positive breast
cancer cells to respond to trastuzumab. Accordingly, our results
suggest that the definition of responsiveness to trastuzumab based
on cell proliferation may be too limited in breast (and perhaps
other) cancer cell types. Moreover, primary trastuzumab resistance
may actually prime the responsiveness of a tumor cell to other
classes of therapeutic inhibitors. CML patients who acquire

imatinib resistance develop tumor phenotypes that can be used to
target vulnerable (and tumor specific) growth regulatory pathways.
By analogy, here, we show that emergent phenotypic changes in
trastuzumab-primed tumor cells also may be exploitable to more
effectively target these cells. As such, this study is among the first to
provide experimental evidence in support of the recent proposal by
Yarden and colleagues (8) that the plasticity of signaling networks
can be exploited to increase therapeutic efficacy, and also to expose
novel therapeutic targets in cells that are resistant to growth
inhibition by trastuzumab.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. BT-474, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, T47D,
UACC812, and UACC893 breast carcinoma cells were cultured in RPMI
1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate (Invitrogen). MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, T47D, UACC812, and
UACC893 cells were cultured long-term for 12 wk in media without
trastuzumab (parental) or supplemented with 100 Ag/mL trastuzumab
(T100).
Determination of trastuzumab primary resistance. BT-474, SKBR-3,
MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, T47D, UACC812, and UACC893 cells were
rinsed with PBS, trypsinized, and seeded into 96-well plates in complete
media (see above) supplemented with 0 to 75 Ag/mL trastuzumab in
quintuplicate. Cell proliferation of each trastuzumab-treated cell line was
measured after 120 h by a WST-1–based colorimetric assay (Roche
Diagnostics) and compared with untreated cells.
Immunoblot analysis of HER expression. Near-confluent (80–90%)
dishes of cells cultured with (T100) or without (parental) 100 Ag/mL
trastuzumab were harvested and lysed with 2.5% SDS, 0.5% NP40, and 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate with boiling for 10 min, or per manufacturer’s
instructions using the Human Phospho-MAPK Array kit (R&D Systems,
Inc.). Cell lysate total protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC
assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the quantitative standard. Equal
total protein quantities of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gel
proteins were transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membrane by semidry
immunoblot (Millipore) and blocked with TBS [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150
mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.4)] with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Membranes were
rinsed 6 times for 5 min each with TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-TW20),
and incubated with TBS with 1% BSA and primary anti–epidermal growth

factor receptor (EGFR; sc-03; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; 1:500 dilution) or
anti-HER3 (sc-285; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; 1:250 dilution) overnight at
4jC. Membranes were rinsed 6 times for 10 min each with TBS-TW20 and
incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce; 1:4,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were rinsed 6 times for 10 min each with TBS-TW20, and
chemiluminescence was visualized with a NucleoVISION camera station
after incubation with ECL reagent (Pierce).
HER inhibitor response assay. Parental or T100 MDA-MB-361, MDAMB-453, T47D, UACC812, and UACC893 cells were rinsed with PBS,
trypsinized, and seeded at a density of 2.5  103 cells per well into 96-well
plates in a total volume of 50 AL per well in assay medium without
trastuzumab consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin,
streptomycin, glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10 Ag/mL transferrin, and
200 Ag/mL BSA. After overnight incubation, 50 AL of culture media with
FBS (described above) with 2 Amol/L gefitinib, 400 Ag/mL cetuximab, or
20 Ag/mL ErbB3 inactivating antibody (H3.105; NeoMarkers) was added to
wells in quintuplicate. After 120 h, cell proliferation was measured by a
WST-1–based colorimetric assay.

Results and Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term effect of
trastuzumab exposure on so-called trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells to gain insight into the 20-50% of patients who show
primary resistance to trastuzumab therapy in the adjuvant setting,
and 70% of patients who show primary resistance to trastuzumab
monotherapy (6, 9). In agreement with previous reports (10, 11),
trastuzumab inhibited proliferation of HER2-positive BT-474 and
SKBR-3 breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, several other
HER2-positive breast carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-361,
MDA-MB-453, T47D, UACC812, and UACC893) were far less
sensitive to optimal patient serum trastuzumab concentrations
(i.e., f10 Ag/mL). We, therefore, used these trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cell lines as experimental model systems of primary
trastuzumab resistance, to further study the mechanism(s)
underlying resistance in vitro.
To approximate breast cancer trastuzumab resistance in vitro,
HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines were cultured for 12 weeks in
media containing 100 Ag/mL trastuzumab, hereafter designated
as T100 cells. Parental cell lines also were cultured without

BT-474, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453,
T47D, UACC812, and UACC893 cells were
exposed to trastuzumab (0–75 Ag/mL) for
120 h, and cell proliferation was measured by a
WST-1–based colorimetric assay in quintuplicate
(n = 2). BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells were
significantly growth inhibited by trastuzumab
(i.e., primary trastuzumab sensitive), whereas
MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, T47D, UACC812,
and UACC893 cells were not significantly growth
inhibited by trastuzumab (primary trastuzumab
resistant).

Trastuzumab Induces HER-Family Reprogramming

trastuzumab. In agreement with others, we observed low but
detectable levels of EGFR expression in T47D cells by immunoblot
analysis (see Fig. 2); notably, at least two other laboratories
have shown functional EGFR signaling in T47D cells (12, 13).
Strikingly, EGFR expression was up-regulated in three of five
primary trastuzumab-resistant T100 cell lines compared with
parental cells, and HER3 expression was up-regulated in five of
five primary trastuzumab-resistant T100 cell lines after long-term
trastuzumab exposure (see Fig. 2). These results show that primary
trastuzumab resistance as defined by no change in cell population
number is not equivalent to a lack of trastuzumab activity; rather,
continuous trastuzumab exposure induces a measurable reprogramming of HER receptor tyrosine kinase expression in 5 of 5
resistant cell lines.
To evaluate what, if any, potential clinical benefit could be
derived by exploiting trastuzumab-induced HER expression
reprogramming, trastuzumab-resistant parental and T100 cells
were treated with two different classes of FDA-approved EGFRtargeted therapeutics using methods described previously (14). As
illustrated in Fig. 3, cell growth patterns were altered in T100 cells
compared with parental cell lines after EGFR inhibitor treatment,
demonstrating that HER function as well as expression is
reprogrammed in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells after
long-term trastuzumab exposure. Specifically, de novo sensitivity to
either gefitinib or cetuximab was observed in two of the three T100
cell populations that showed an increase in EGFR expression;
furthermore, one T100 cell population acquired sensitivity to a
HER3-targeted antibody (15). These results are consistent with the
previous observation that HER expression levels do not always
predict (a) a dose-dependent increase in responsiveness to
inhibitor (reviewed in ref. 16), (b) HER mutations/overexpression
resulting in constitutive receptor activation, and (c) alterations in
the expression of HER ligand levels or downstream effectors. All of
these conditions may contribute to HER signal transduction in
primary resistant cells.

Together, these results show that HER reprogramming after
long-term trastuzumab exposure of primary resistant breast cancer
cells is not only correlated with functional changes in the HER
receptor tyrosine kinase axis but also unmasks de novo targets for
therapeutic intervention. These observations are consistent with
Friedman and Perrimon’s (17) suggestion that robust signaling via
a given receptor tyrosine kinase axis consists of interconnected
graded components, such that disruption of one pathway is
compensated for by other pathways. Alternatively, one might
envision HER2 functioning as an addictive oncogene in some
(i.e., trastuzumab-sensitive) but not all HER2-positive breast cancer
cell lines. In this latter case, the phenotype of primary trastuzumab
resistance might cosegregate with other gene mutations, and
identification of such patterns of mutation may one day allow
physicians to predict which breast tumors will be sensitive to HERtargeted therapy after trastuzumab treatment (18), as is already
being done in imatinib-resistant CML patients (3). Admittedly, in
some instances long-term trastuzumab treatment induced de novo
resistance to EGFR and/or HER3-targeted therapeutics in this
study. However, because no EGFR or HER3-targeted therapeutics
have yet been FDA approved for breast cancer treatment, and also
given the availability of EGFR inhibitors and the ongoing
development of HER3-directed inhibitors, we propose that the
unexplored strategy of priming primary trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer patients with trastuzumab therapy, followed by
treatment with one (or more) newly unmasked EGFR/HER3 targets
warrants further investigation.
In conclusion, we recognize that as intriguing as these results
are, it will be important to confirm and extend our observations in
other studies before any benefit may be realized in the clinic. Our
results suggest, however, that trastuzumab-induced reprogramming of the HER axis may be a predictable outcome in breast
cancer patients after trastuzumab treatment. We propose that
trastuzumab-induced alterations in cell signaling occur in de novo
resistant tumor cells, and we further show that these changes are
therapeutically exploitable. Specifically, trastuzumab may unmask

other targets in primary resistant breast tumors by reprogramming
members of the HER axis, such as EGFR, the therapeutic target of
gefitinib and cetuximab. Considering the significant number of
HER2-positive breast cancer patients who exhibit primary trastuzumab resistance, we conclude that further study of trastuzumabinduced gene expression within trastuzumab-resistant tumors is
warranted. Our findings suggest that, contrary to widely held
assumptions, primary trastuzumab resistance is not synonymous
with lack of trastuzumab activity in tumor cells, and as such, is a
far more complex phenomenon than previously considered. As
such, this work opens up important new avenues of investigation
for testing the use of this novel therapeutic agent as a priming
agent in the development of new treatment interventions for
breast, and perhaps other cancer patients.

Note Added in Proof
Recent studies on the mechanism of HER2 degradation may
provide a rationale for the observations presented here regarding
EGFR and ErbB3 receptor reprogramming in trastuzumab-resistant
cells (19-22).
