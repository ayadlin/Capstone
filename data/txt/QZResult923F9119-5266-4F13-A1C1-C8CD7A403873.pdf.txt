ABSTRACT
FTY720, Fingolimod, is a functional antagonist to the sphingosine-1-phoaphate
(S1P) receptor and an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 1. Here, we showed that a
combination of FTY720 and TRAIL induced apoptosis in human renal, breast, and
colon carcinoma cells. Most importantly, this combination had no effect on normal
cells. Furthermore, the combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL reduced tumor
growth in xenograft models. FTY720 up-regulated death receptor (DR)5 at posttranslational level. Knockdown of DR5 markedly blocked apoptosis induced by the
combined treatment. FTY720 also inhibited Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational
level. Over-expression of Mcl-1 blocked apoptosis induced by FTY720 and TRAIL.
Interestingly, phospho-FTY720 and inhibitors of sphingosine kinase failed to enhance
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, FTY720 enables TRAIL-induced apoptosis through
up-regulation of DR5 and down-regulation of Mcl-1 in human cancer cells.

are independent of S1P signaling. The induction of protein
phosphatase 2A [17], phospholipase C [18], and protein
kinase C (PKC) activity was proposed to be involved in
anti-cancer effects by FTY720.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) is a known inducer of apoptosis in cancer
cells but not normal cells [19]. When TRAIL induces cell
death, it binds to death receptor (DR) 4 and DR5, which
have increased expression levels relative to normal cells
[20]. In contrast, normal cells highly express decoy receptor
(DcR) 1 and DcR2, such that this death-signaling pathway is
unable to activate intracellular apoptotic signaling [21–24].
However, the down-regulation of DR expression, the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins expression (c-FLIP(L),
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and the up-regulation of inhibitor of
apoptosis proteins (IAPs) lead to resistance to TRAILmediated apoptosis in many cancer cells [25–29]. There
are many studies that demonstrated related mechanisms
of synergy between TRAIL and numerous agents [30–39].
Therefore, combination treatment with the TRAIL sensitizer
could overcome TRAIL resistance.
In this study, we investigated whether FTY720
sensitized human renal carcinoma Caki cells to

INTRODUCTION
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) increases cancer cell
proliferation [1, 2] and tumorigenesis [3, 4] and reduces
cancer cell death [5]. FTY720 is a synthetic sphingosine
analogue and is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase
2 [6]. Phospho-FTY720 binds sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) receptors and induces the internalization of S1P
receptors. Therefore, FTY720 acts as a functional
antagonist [7]. The immunosuppressant effects of FTY720
are well known. Among the S1P receptors, S1P1 plays a
crucial role in modulating lymphocyte migration and
trafficking. Phospho-FTY720 binds S1P1 and then inhibits
T lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs and
migration into the transplanted graft, thereby suppressing
inflammation [8]. In addition, novel functions of FTY720
have been reported. FTY720 induces cell death in
multiple cancer cells, including cells from leukemia [9,
10], prostate [11], ovarian [12], and pancreatic [13] lines.
Furthermore, FTY720 also sensitizes prostate cancer cells
to radiotherapy [14], melanoma cells to cisplatin [15],
and colon cancer cells to doxorubicin and etoposide [16].

and TRAIL markedly enhanced the sub-G1 population
and PARP cleavage, which are markers of apoptosis, in a
dose-dependent manner; they also induced morphological
changes (Figure 1A and 1B). Next, we examined whether
combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL induces
DNA fragmentation. We analyzed the DNA fragmentation
induced by the combined treatment with FTY720 and
TRAIL (Figure 1C) and detected the typical apoptotic
nuclei (Figure 1D). Therefore, we examined whether
combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL have
synergistic effects. Combined treatment with various
concentrations of FTY720 and TRAIL markedly reduced
cell viability. The isobologram analysis suggested that
the combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL has
synergistic effects (Figure 1E). In addition, as shown
in Figure 1F, FTY720 plus TRAIL increased caspase
2, 3, 8, and 9 activation (Figure 1F, and Supplementary
Figure S1), and the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD markedly

TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We found that FTY720
enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in Caki cells
through the up-regulation of DR5 and down-regulation of
Mcl-1 expression. Collectively, our results suggest that
combination treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL might be
an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

RESULTS
Combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL
induces apoptosis
FTY720 is known to have anti-cancer effects
in several types of cancer cells [9, 10]. Therefore, we
investigated whether FTY720 can sensitize human renal
carcinoma Caki cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
Neither FTY720 nor TRAIL alone had any effect on
apoptosis, but combined treatment with both FTY720

Figure 1: FTY720 sensitizes Caki cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. (A) Caki cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TRAIL in
the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of FTY720 for 24 h. The sub-G1 fraction was measured by flow cytometry as an
indicator of the level of apoptosis. The protein expression levels of PARP were determined by western blotting. The level of actin was
used as a loading control. (B–D) Caki cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TRAIL in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations
of FTY720 for 24 h. The cell morphology was examined using interference light microscopy (B). Fragmented DNA was extracted and
analyzed on a 2% agarose gel (C). The condensation and fragmentation of the nuclei were detected by 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole
staining (D). (E) Isoboles were obtained by plotting the combined concentrations of each drug required to produce 50% cell death. The
straight line connecting the IC50 values obtained for the two agents when applied alone corresponded to the addition of their independent
effects. Values below this line indicate synergy, whereas values above this line indicate antagonism. (F) Caki cells were treated with 50
ng/ml TRAIL in the presence or absence of 15 μM FTY720 for 24 h. Caspase activities were determined with colorimetric assays using
caspase-3 (DEVDase) assay kits. (G) Caki cells were treated with 15 μM FTY720 plus 50 ng/ml TRAIL for 24 h in the presence or absence
of 20 μM z-VAD-fmk (z-VAD). The sub-G1 fraction was measured by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of PARP and actin
were determined by western blotting. The level of actin was used as a loading control. The values in A, F, and G represent the mean ± SD

Caki cells.

that combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL might
induce apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells.

FTY720 plus TRAIL induces apoptosis in other
cancer cells, but not in normal cells

Next, we investigated whether combined treatment
with FTY720 and TRAIL had anti-cancer effects in an
in vivo xenograft model. Mice bearing tumors were treated
with FTY720 alone, TRAIL alone, and FTY720 plus
TRAIL. Combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL
was found to markedly inhibit tumor growth compared
with the vehicle control, FTY720 alone, or TRAIL alone
(Figure 3A and 3B). Furthermore, we detected cell death
using a TUNEL assay in FTY720 and TRAIL-treated
samples (Figure 3C). In contrast, FTY720 and TRAIL
treatment had no effect on the mouse weight (Figure 3D).
These data suggest that combined treatment with FTY720
and TRAIL inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis
in vivo.

To investigate the effects of FTY720 on TRAILmediated apoptosis, we co-treated other cancer cells with
FTY720 and TRAIL. Combined treatment with FTY720
and TRAIL markedly induced apoptosis in renal cancer
cells (ACHN and A498), human breast carcinoma cells
(MDA-MB-231 cells) and human colon carcinoma (HT29)
cells (Figure 2A and 2B). In contrast, combined treatment
with FTY720 and TRAIL produced no morphological
changes and had no effect on the induction of the sub-G1
population and PARP cleavage in normal mouse kidney
cells (TMCK-1) (Figure 2C and 2D). These data indicate

sub-G1 fraction using flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of PARP and actin were determined by western blotting. The level of
actin was used as the loading control. (C and D) Caki and TMCK-1 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TRAIL in the presence or absence of

by western blotting. The level of actin was used as a loading control (D, lower panel). The values in A, B, and D represent the mean ± SD

Up-regulation of DR5 is associated with FTY720
and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis

with DR5 siRNA. The down-regulation of DR5 by siRNA
markedly inhibited apoptosis caused by the combined
treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL and PARP cleavage
(Figure 4E). These results indicate that FTY720 induces
the up-regulation of DR5 protein expression at the posttranslational level and that the FTY720-mediated DR5 upregulation is involved in the effects of FTY720 on TRAIL
sensitization.

Death receptors (DRs) play key roles in TRAILmediated apoptosis [22, 24]. Therefore, we determine
whether FTY720 modulates the expression of DRs.
FTY720 markedly induces DR5 expression, but not DR4
expression (Figure 4A). Next, we investigated whether
FTY720 modulates DR5 expression at the transcriptional
level. As shown in Figure 4B and 4C, FTY720 did not
induce DR5 mRNA expression or promoter activity.
Furthermore, FTY720 had no effect on the expression
of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which is
an important transcription factor that is involved in the
regulation of DR5 mRNA expression (Supplementary
Figure S2). Therefore, we investigated whether FTY720
modulates the protein stability of DR5. To investigate this
possibility, Caki cells were treated with FTY720 for 18 h,
washed with FTY720, and then treated with or without
FTY720 in the presence of 20 μg/ml cycloheximide
(CHX) for the various indicated times. FTY720 was found
to increase DR5 protein stability in Caki cells (Figure 4D).
Next, to confirm the significance of the up-regulation of
DR5 expression, Caki cells were transiently transfected

The down-regulation of Mcl-1 is associated with
FTY720 and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
Next, we investigated whether FTY720 modulates
the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins. The
detected apoptosis regulatory proteins did not markedly
change their expression levels, but Mcl-1 expression was
reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the FTY720treated cells (Figure 5A). FTY720 induced the downregulation of Mcl-1 protein expression within 9 h (Figure
5A). Therefore, we examined whether FTY720 modulates
Mcl-1 mRNA expression. However, FTY720 had no effect
on Mcl-1 mRNA expression (Figure 5B).

(A) Caki cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of FTY720 for 24 h. The protein expression levels of DR5, DR4, and actin
were determined by western blotting. The level of actin was used as a loading control. (B) Caki cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of FTY720 for 24 h. DR5 mRNA was determined using RT-PCR. (C) Caki cells were transiently transfected with plasmids
(DR5/SacI and DR5/-605) harboring the luciferase gene under the control of the DR5 promoter. They were then treated with 15 μM
FTY720 for 18 h. The cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured. (D) Caki cells were treated with 15 μM FTY720 for 18 h,
washed with PBS, and then treated with 20 μg/ml cyclohexamide (CHX) in the presence or absence of 15 μM FTY720 for the indicated
time periods. DR5 and actin protein levels were determined by western blotting. Actin expression was used as the loading control. The
band intensity of the DR5 protein was measured using the public-domain JAVA image-processing program ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.

indicated time periods, FTY720 decreased the Mcl1 protein stability in Caki cells (Figure 5C). Previous
studies reported that the degradation of Mcl-1 was
mainly modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
[40]. Therefore, we investigated whether FTY720 also
modulates Mcl-1 protein expression via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. First, we determine the effect
of the proteasome inhibitor (lactacystin) on FTY720induced Mcl-1 degradation. As shown in Figure 5D,
lactacystin markedly reversed the FTY720-induced downregulation of Mcl-1. Next, to determine whether the Mcl1 degradation caused by FTY720 treatment is dependent
on ubiquitination, Caki cells were transiently transfected
with Flag-Mcl-1 or Flag-Mcl-1KR, in which all 14 lysine
residues were replaced with arginine. As shown in Figure
5E, CHX and FTY720 treatment led to the degradation of
the Flag-Mcl-1 protein; the degradation of the Flag-Mcl-1KR
protein is slower than the degradation of Flag-Mcl-1. These
data indicate that FTY720-mediated Mcl-1 degradation is
mainly ubiquitin-dependent, but that the involvement of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ubiquitin-independent pathway might also be associated
with the degradation of Mcl-1 proteins. To investigate the
mechanism of Mcl-1 degradation, we examined whether
Mcl-1 expression was dependent on mitogen activated
protein kinase (MAPK) activation in the FTY720-treated
cells. However, the use of MAPK inhibitors did not
block Mcl-1 down-regulation in the FTY720-treated
cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Next, we investigated
whether the down-regulation of Mcl-1 is critical for
apoptosis following combined treatment with FTY720 and
TRAIL. When Mcl-1 was over-expressed, the induction
of apoptosis and cleavage of PARP caused by combined
treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL decreased (Figure 5F
and 5G). To confirm the importance of the down-regulation
of Mcl-1 expression on TRAIL sensitization, Caki cells
were transiently transfected with Mcl-1 siRNA. The
down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression by siRNA sensitized
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (Figure 5H). These results
indicate that the down-regulation of Mcl-1 has an important
role on FTY720-mediated TRAIL sensitization.

The effect of FTY720-induced ROS production
on TRAIL sensitization

FTY720 is associated with TRAIL sensitization. The levels
of intracellular ROS production are markedly up-regulated
in FTY720-treated cells (Figure 6A). However, ROS
scavengers [trolox (trol), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and
glutathione ethyl ester (GEE)] were found to have no effect
on FTY720 induced-DR5 up-regulation and Mcl-1 downregulation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, ROS scavengers did
not affect apoptosis resulting from the combined treatment

FTY720 induced intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production in cancer cells [10, 41]. The
induction of higher ROS levels is known to play an
important role in TRAIL sensitization [42, 43]. Therefore,
we investigated whether the induction of ROS levels by

6C). These results suggest that effect of FTY720 on TRAIL
sensitization is independent of the level of ROS production.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that FTY720
sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the
up-regulation of DR5 and down-regulation of Mcl-1
expression in human renal Caki cells.

of S1P receptor signaling by assessing the impact of
phospho-FTY720 on TRAIL sensitization. In contrast
to FTY720, phospho-FTY720 had no effect on the
TRAIL sensitization, up-regulation of DR5 expression,
or down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression (Supplementary
Figure S4A). Furthermore, sphingosine kinase inhibitors
[N, N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) and sphingosine
kinase inhibitor (SKI)-178] and the down-regulation of
sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) by siRNA also had no effect
on TRAIL sensitization (Supplementary Figure S4B and
Supplementary S4C). These data suggest that the effects
of FTY720 on TRAIL sensitization are independent of
S1P receptor signaling and the inhibition of sphingosine
kinase 1.
FTY720 has been shown to have anti-cancer effects
in several cancer cells, and its major anti-cancer effects
are independent of S1P receptor signaling. First, FTY720
induces apoptosis in human hepatoma cells through the
activation of PKC δ signaling [41]. FTY720 induces
ROS production via the down-regulation of anti-oxidant
enzyme (GST-π) expression and then activates PKCδ in
human hepatoma cells [41]. However, the PKC δ inhibitor
(rottlerin) cannot reverse apoptosis in the FTY720 and
TRAIL-treated Caki cells (Supplementary Figure S4D).
In our previous study, we reported that rottlerin induced
apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells through the

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that
FTY720 enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer
cells, but not in normal cells. Furthermore, combined
treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL reduced the tumor
volume and induced apoptosis in a xenograft model.
We found that the mechanism of FTY720-mediated
TRAIL sensitization is associated with the up-regulation
of DR5 protein stability and down-regulation of Mcl-1
protein stability. Although FTY720 markedly increased
the intracellular ROS levels, FTY720-mediated TRAIL
sensitization was found to be independent of ROS
signaling. These findings suggest that FTY720 could be
an attractive drug for TRAIL-sensitization.

Therefore, we suggest that FTY720 may be effectively

up-regulation of DR5 and NAG-1 expression in a PKC
δ–independent manner [44, 45]. Therefore, to confirm the
effect of PKC δ, Caki cells were transiently transfected
with PKC δ siRNA and then treated with FTY720 plus
TRAIL. The down-regulation of PKC δ by siRNA did
not rescue apoptosis in FTY720 plus TRAIL-treated
cells (data not shown). Therefore, the anti-cancer effects
of FTY720 are independent of the activation of PKC δ
in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Second, FTY720
activates protein phosphatase (PP)2A. FTY720 induces
cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells and
leukemia T cells via the activation of PP2A [17, 46].
However, FTY720 also induces caspase-independent cell
death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, but the effects
of FTY720 are independent of PP2A activation. In other
words, the mechanism of FTY720 could differ in different
cell types. In our study, we also investigated whether PP2A
activity is involved in FTY720 and TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. As shown in Supplementary Figure. S4D, a
PP2A inhibitor (okadaic acid) had no effect on apoptosis.
In addition, FTY720 also induced intracellular calcium
concentrations through phospholipase C activation, which
induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia
cells [18]. We found that the FTY720-induced TRAIL
sensitization is independent of phospholipase C activation
(Supplementary Figure S4D). Although we failed to
identify the intracellular mechanism of FTY720, FTY720
could sensitize human renal carcinoma (Caki, ACHN, and
A498 cells), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231),
and human colon carcinoma (HT29) cells to TRAILmediated apoptosis. Therefore, this novel mechanism
might be related to the anti-cancer effects of FTY720 in
cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which FTY720
sensitizes cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis remains
unclear and will require further investigation.
FTY720 induced the up-regulation of DR5 protein
expression at the post-translational level (Figure 4D).
Recently, Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) was found
to modulate the degradation of DR proteins. Cbl has
been known to be a multi-adaptor protein and E3 ligase.
Thus, receptor tyrosine kinases are ubiquitinated by Cbl
and then degraded by proteasome or lysosome [47, 48].
Song et al. reported that c-Cbl is responsible for the
degradation of DRs by proteasomes and lysosomes in
prostate carcinoma cells [49]. Yan et al., also reported
that the down-regulation of Cbl-b by bufalin induced the
up-regulation of DR expression in breast carcinoma cells
[50]. In our study, we also detected a down-regulation of
c-Cbl in FTY720-treated cells (data not shown). However,
this down-regulation of c-Cbl had no effect on DR5
expression or TRAIL sensitization in FTY720-treated cells
(data not shown). Therefore, these results indicate that the
up-regulation of DR5 by FTY720 is independent of the
down-regulation of c-Cbl expression.
Collectively, these results suggest that FTY720
sensitizes TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through the

Flow cytometry analysis
For flow cytometry, the cells were resuspended in
100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 200 μl
of 95% ethanol was added while the cells were being
vortexed. Then, the cells were incubated at 4°C for
1 h, washed with PBS, resuspended in 250 μl of 1.12%
sodium citrate buffer (pH 8.4) with 12.5 μg of RNase
and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C. The
cellular DNA was then stained by adding 250 μl of a
propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml) to the cells for 30
min at room temperature. The stained cells were analyzed
by fluorescent-activated cell sorting on a FACScan flow

for each drug alone and in combination with a fixed
concentration of the second agent [52].

Western blot analysis

Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-ase (DEVDase) activity assay

For the Western blotting experiments, the cells
were washed with cold PBS and lysed on ice in modified
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25%
Na-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, and
1 mM NaF) containing protease inhibitors (100 μM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10
μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mM EDTA). The lysates were
centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and the
supernatant fractions were collected. The proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred
to Immobilon-P membranes. The specific proteins were
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
Western blotting kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

To evaluate DEVDase activity, cell lysates were
prepared after their respective treatments with TRAIL
in the presence or absence of FTY720. Assays were
performed in 96-well microtiter plates by incubating
20 μg of cell lysates in 100 μl of reaction buffer (1%
NP-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol) containing a caspase substrate [Asp-Glu-ValAsp-chromophore-p-nitroanilide (DVAD-pNA)] at 5
μM. Lysates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Thereafter,
the absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a
spectrophotometer.

Animal
Male BALB/c-nude mice, aged 5 weeks, were
purchased from the Central Lab Animal Inc. (Seoul,
Korea). All the mice were allowed 1 week to acclimatize
to the surroundings before the experiments, and were
kept at 25 ± 2°C, with a relative humidity of 55 ± 5%
and a 12 h light–dark cycle. The study protocol was
approved by the IRB Keimyung University Ethics
Committee.

DNA fragmentation assay
After treatment with FTY720 plus TRAIL, Caki
cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH
7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100
for 30 min on ice. Lysates were vortexed and cleared
by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 20 min. Fragmented
DNA in the supernatant was extracted with an equal
volume of neutral phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
mixture (25:24:1) and analyzed electrophoretically
on 2% agarose gels containing 0.1 μg/ml of ethidium
bromide.

in vivo xenograft model
Each mouse was subcutaneously (s.c.) injected
on each flank with Caki cells (2 × 106). After tumors
had grown after approximately 2 weeks, 28 mice were
randomly divided into four treatment groups: (1) vehicle
alone, (2) FTY720 alone, (3) GST-TRAIL alone, and
(4) FTY720 plus GST-TRAIL. FTY720 and GSTTRAIL were administered at 7.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg,
respectively. FTY720 and GST-TRIAL were prepared
in PBS (pH 7.4). The mice received an intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of vehicle, FTY720 and GST-TRAIL.
Treatment was administered three times a week for
4 weeks. The tumor size was measured three times a
week using a Vernier’s caliper (Mytutoyo Co., Japan) to
measure two perpendicular diameters, and the tumor size
was calculated using the equation (length × width2)/2.
The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and
the tumors were collected for histological analysis. The
tumors were fixed in 30% formalin, embedded in OCT
compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN, USA) and cut into 20μm sections using a cryostat (SLEE International, Inc.,
New York, NY, USA).

4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (DAPI)
for nuclei condensation and fragmentation
To examine cellular nuclei, the cells were fixed with
1% paraformaldehyde on glass slides for 30 min at room
temperature. After the fixation, the cells were washed
with PBS and a 300 nM 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole
solution (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added to the
fixed cells for 5 min. After the nuclei were stained, the
cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy.

Determination of synergy
The possible synergistic effect of FTY720 and
TRAIL was evaluated using the isobologram method. In
brief, the cells were treated with different concentrations of
FTY720 and TRAIL alone or in combination. After 24 h,
XTT assay was employed to measure the cell viability
using WelCount Cell Viability Assay Kit (WelGENE,
Daegu, Korea). In brief, reagent was added to each well
and was then measured with a multi-well plate reader (at
450 nm/690 nm). Relative survival was assessed and the
concentration effect curves were used to determine the
IC50 (the half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values

TUNEL assay
Apoptosis in tumor cells was detected by terminal
deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) assay. It was performed using the

[GFP (control)], AAG ACC CGC GCC GAG GUG AAG.
Cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides using
Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Stable transfection in Caki cells
The Caki cells were transfected in a stable manner
with the pFLAG-CMV4-Mcl-1, or control plasmid
pcDNA 3.1 vector using Lipofectamine2000 as prescribed
by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
After 48 h of incubation, transfected cells were selected
in primary cell culture medium containing 700 μg/mL
G418 (Invitrogen). After 2 or 3 weeks, single independent
clones were randomly isolated, and each individual clone
was plated separately. After clonal expansion, cells from
each independent clone were tested for expression levels
of Mcl-1 by immunoblotting.

Total RNA was isolated using the TriZol reagent
(Life Technologies; Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and the
cDNA was prepared using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Gibco-BRL; Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. The following primers were
used for the amplification of human DR5, Mcl-1, and
actin: DR5 (sense) 5′- AAG ACC CTT GTG CTC GTT
GT-3′ and (antisense) 5′- GAC ACA TTC GAT GTC ACT
CCA-3′, Mcl-1 (sense) 5′- GCG ACT GGC AAA GCT
TGG CCT CAA-3′ and (antisense) 5′- GTT ACA GCT
TGG ATC CCA ACT GCA-3′, and actin (sense) 5′- GGC
ATC GTC ACC AAC TGG GAC -3′ and (anti-sense)
5′- CGA TTT CCC GCT CGG CCG TGG -3′. The PCR
amplification was carried out using the following cycling
conditions: 94°C for 3 min followed by 17 (actin) or 23
cycles (DR5 and Mcl-1) of 94°C for 45 s, 58°C for 45 s,
72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis
on a 1.5% agarose gel and detected under UV light.

Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Intracellular accumulation of ROS was de­
termined
using
the
fluorescent
probes
2′,
7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA).
H2DCFDA is commonly used to measure ROS generation.
Caki cells were treated with FTY720, and then cells
were stained with the fluorescent dye H2DCFDA for
an additional 10 min. Then, cells were trypsinized and
resuspended in PBS, and fluorescence was measured at
specific time intervals with a flow cytometer (Becton–
Dickinson; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Plasmids, transfection and luciferase assay
The pDR5/SacI plasmid [containing DR5 promoter
sequence (−2500/+3)] and pDR5/ − 605 [containing DR5
promoter sequence (−605/+3)] were a gift from Dr Sakai T
(Kyoto Prefectural University). Transient transfection was
performed in 6-well plates.
One day before the transfection, Caki cells were
plated at approximately 60–80% confluence. The DR5/
SacI and DR5/-605 promoter plasmid was transfected
into the cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, CA, USA). To assess the promoter-driven
expression of the luciferase gene, the cells were
collected and disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer
(25 mM Tris-phosphate pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), and aliquots of the
supernatants were used to analyze the luciferase activity
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega;
Madison, WI, USA).

Densitometry
The band intensities were scanned and quantified
using the gel analysis plugin for the open source software
ImageJ 1.46 (Imaging Processing and Analysis in Java;
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).

Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA
and post-hoc comparisons (Student-Newman-Keuls) using
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 22.0 software
(SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA).
