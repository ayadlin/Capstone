ABSTRACT
CD133 is widely used as a surface marker to isolate cancer stem cells (CSCs).
Here we show that in CSCs CD133 contributes to β-catenin-mediated transcriptional
activation and to the self-renewal capacity of sphere-forming and side-population
(SP) cells in cell lines from brain, colon and lung cancers, but not gastric or breast
cancers. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, β-catenin binding to the proximal
promoter regions of ITGA2-4 and ITGA10-11 in brain, colon and lung cancer cell lines
could be triggered by CD133, and β-catenin also bound to the proximal promoter
regions of ITGB6 and ITGB8 in cell lines from gastric and breast cancers. CD133 thus
induces β-catenin binding and transcriptional activation of diverse targets that are
cancer type-specific. Cell migration triggered by wounding CD133+ cells cultured on
ECM-coated dishes can induce polarity and lipid raft coalescence, enhancing CD133/
integrin signaling and asymmetric cell division. In response to directional cues,
integrins, Src and the Par complex were enriched in lipid rafts, and the assembly
and activation of an integrated CD133-integrin-Par signaling complex was followed
by Src/Akt/GSK3β signaling. The subsequent increase and nuclear translocation
of β-catenin may be a regulatory switch to increase drug resistance and stemness
properties. Collectively, these findings 1) indicate that a polarized cell migrationinduced CD133/integrin/Src/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis is required for maintenance
of CSC properties, 2) establish a function for CD133 and 3) support the rationale for
targeting CD133 in cancer treatment.

cancer stem cells (CSCs) from a variety of tumors [3].
The precise functions of CD133 are not yet known. Its
unique distribution suggests CD133 may be involved in
membrane organization. This idea is supported by the fact
that loss of CD133 from the plasma membrane of human
retinal cells causes retinal degeneration, possibly due
to impaired generation of evaginations and/or impaired
conversion of evaginations to disks [4]. Topologically,

INTRODUCTION
Promonin-1, also called CD133, is a fivetransmembrane glycoprotein that typically localizes at
membrane protrusions [1]. CD133 was first discovered as
a surface antigen on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells [2]
and has been used in combination with other cell-surface
markers, including CD24, CD34, and CD44, to isolate

CD133 is located in cholesterol-containing lipid rafts
in membrane microdomains, where it is involved in
mediating signaling cascades [5]. CD133 may also affect
whether cell division is symmetric or asymmetric [6]
and may be a mediator of cellular polarity and migration
[7]. The function of CD133 is even less clear in the
context of cancer. Despite its ubiquitous presence on
CSCs from various solid tumors, it is unknown whether
the intracellular signaling downstream of CD133
contributes to the maintenance of cellular stemness.
CD133 signaling reportedly enhances self-renewal and
tumorigenic potential in glioma stem cells through the Src
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways
[8, 9]. Clinically, strong CD133 expression correlates with
chemo/radio-resistance and a poor prognosis [10].
Cellular polarity, or the asymmetric distribution
of a cell’s components, is a fundamental feature of the
epithelium. Establishment of proper apical-basal polarity
is crucial to the shape, organization and function of
epithelial tissue [11]. Loss of polarity is associated with
disruption of cellular architecture, loss of intercellular
adhesion and contact inhibition, and eventually cancer
initiation and progression [12]. Partition-defective 6 (Par6)
is a critical regulator of apical-basal polarity, polarized cell
movement and asymmetric cell division (ACD). The socalled Par polarity complex is composed of Par6, Par3,
atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and cell division control
protein 42. The complex is recruited by signals mediated
by integrin and TGFβ [13]. ACD is a feature of stem and
progenitor cells, and several key regulators of ACD are
known tumor suppressors; thus loss of cellular polarity
and dysregulation of ACD may lead to tumor formation,
invasion and metastasis [14]. CSCs retain the ability to
divide asymmetrically [15], which accounts, at least
in part, for the heterogeneity seen in most tumors and
suggests that ACD may also contribute to the maintenance
of CSCs. The exact mechanism(s) by which cellular
polarity and ACD affects the properties of CSCs is not
known, however.
Our findings in the present study suggest there are
links among the tumor niche, CD133, cell polarity, ACD
and CSCs, and indicate that targeting CD133 may be an
effective means of interfering with tumorigenesis and/or
metastasis.

10 metastatic) and breast (56 primary and 79 metastatic)
cancer. IHC scoring was determined by multiplying the
staining intensity by the percentage of positive tumor
cells [16, 17]. We found that CD133 levels were higher
in metastatic lung cancers than primary cancers (Figure
1A–1B, 1E), whereas there were no differences between
metastatic and primary breast cancers (Figure 1C–1D, 1F).
There was also a direct association between CD133 levels
and tumor stage in lung cancer, which reached a maximum
in metastatic lung tumors. This association was not seen
in breast cancer.

CD133 is a functionally important cell-surface
marker in CSCs
Although cancer cell lines are initially established
from a single-cell clone, they likely become heterogeneous
after long-term culture owing to the genetic instability of
cancer cells. This makes it possible to isolate fractions with
different characteristics, particularly the CSC population,
for which there are specific cell surface markers, including
CD133. CD133 levels (Figure 2A) and the size of the
CD133+ fraction (Figure 2B) in various cancer cell lines
were determined using flow cytometry. We first used
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to divide the
cancer cells into CD133+ and CD133− fractions. There
appears to be a link between CD133 and the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway [18, 19], which CD133 can stabilize, leading to
activation of β-catenin signaling targets. In the present
study, TOPflash reporter activity (to measure β-catenindependent transcriptional activity) in the CD133+ fraction
was increased 5- to 10-fold compared to the CD133−
fraction in some cell lines from brain, colon and lung
cancers, but not gastric or breast cancers (Figure 2C). In
addition, CD133 enhanced the self-renewal capability of
the sphere-forming and side-population (SP) cells. Selfrenewal capability of the sphere-forming cells (Figure 2D)
over four serial passages and SP cells (Figure 2E) were
increased exclusively in some CD133+ cell lines from brain,
colon and lung cancers. Taken together, these findings
suggest the cell-surface marker CD133 is functionally
important for β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation
in CSCs and for the self-renewal capability of the sphereforming and SP cells in some cell lines from brain, colon
and lung cancers, but not gastric or breast cancers.

To validate the clinical relevance of CD133 to
human cancers and its contribution to maintenance of the
CSC population in tumors, we used immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining and scoring analysis [16, 17] to assess
CD133 in sections of human lung (35 primary and

CD133-HA (ectopic expression of CD133) and U87MG/
CD133+ (endogenous expression of CD133) cells
produced sphere colonies, while U87MG/CD133−/Mock
cells did not (Figure 3A). Consistent with this observation,
elimination of CD133 transcripts in U87MG/CD133+ cells
using lentivirus-based RNA interference inhibited sphere
formation. When we test the self-renewal capability of
the sphere-forming cells, we found that ~12 (CD133-HA
expressed in CD133− U87MG, DLD1 and H1299 cells)
and ~10 (control short hairpin RNA [shRNA, ControlshRNA] expressed in CD133+ U87MG, DLD1 and H1299
cells) spheres formed per 100 seeded cells (12% and
10%, respectively), whereas < 4% of seeded cells formed
spheres among CD133−/Mock and CD133+/CD133-shRNA
cells (Figure 3B). To further define the CD133 domains
involved in self-renewal of sphere-forming cells, a set of
extracellular- (E) and intracellular- (C) domain deletion
mutants were generated from wild-type cells (Figure 3C
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and 3D). Wild-type CD133 promoted β-catenin-mediated
transcriptional activity (Figure 3E) and self-renewal
(Figure 3F) in CD133− U87MG, DLD1 and H1299
cells, but CD133ΔC3, CD133ΔC7, CD133ΔC3-7 and
CD133ΔC11 did not promote the transcriptional activity
(Figure 3E) or self-renewal (Figure 3F).

CD133-mediated maintenance of CSC
properties is depend on cancer-specific integrin/
extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling
ECM is crucial for maintenance of CSC properties,
as indicated by the observation that pure populations of
adhesive glioma stem cells can be expanded in laminincoated culture plates [20]. As shown in Figure 4A, CD133
expression enhanced adherence of U87MG, DLD1 and
H1299 cells to collagen/laminin, as well as attachment
of NCI-N87 and MCF7 cells to fibronectin. In addition,

had no effect on SP cell percentages, whereas SP cells
percentages were increased in CD133+ U87MG, DLD1
and H1299 cells cultured on collagen- or laminin-coated
dishes (Figure 4B).
We next used FACS to assess expression of integrin
subunits in U87MG, DLD1 and H1299 cells. In the
CD133+ fraction, levels of collagen receptors (α2, α10
and α11 integrins) and laminin receptors (α3 integrin)
were 2- to 3-fold higher than in the CD133− fraction
(Figure 4C). Similarly, levels of fibronectin receptors (β6
and β8 integrins) were enhanced in CD133+ NCI-N87
and MCF7 cells. These FACS results were validated by

proximal promoter regions of ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGA4,
ITGA10 and ITGA11 in U87MG, DLD1 and H1299 cells
could be triggered by CD133 (Figure 4D). β-catenin also
bound to the proximal promoter regions of ITGB6 and
ITGB8 in NCI-N87 and MCF7 cells. These results were
confirmed by mapping of the CD133 domains affecting
β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. CD133ΔC3-7
and CD133ΔC11 failed to promote β-catenin binding to
the proximal promoter region of integrin genes and the
consequent transcriptional activity (Figure 4E and 4F).
Taken together, these results show that CD133 elicits
β-catenin binding and transcriptional activation of diverse
targets that are cancer type-specific.

Cell migration triggered by wounding is a
pivotal step toward inducing polarity and lipid
raft coalescence and enhancing CD133/integrin
signaling

that cell migration triggered by wounding can induce
polarity and lipid raft coalescence and enhance CD133/
integrin signaling.

Polarized localization of CD133/integrins
in migrating cells contributes to ACD

Partitioning of molecules into specific membrane
microdomains, termed rafts, may localize proteins
at the front or the rear of moving cells, enabling
rafts to function as platforms for local activation and
coordination of the signaling pathways during cell
migration [21]. We examined the distribution of CD133/
integrins in lipid rafts after inducing cell (cultured
on collagen-coated dishes) migration by wounding
(establishing the polarity in migrating cells [22]). After
solubilizing the CD133+ cells in cold Triton X-100
buffer and subsequent sucrose gradient centrifugation
[23], the lipid rafts were recovered from low-density
fractions 2–4, as indicated by the presence of caveolin-1
and flotillin-2 [23, 24]. The Triton X-100-soluble
cellular components were distributed over fractions
7–10. Cell migration triggered by wounding induced
lipid raft coalescence. It also promoted the enrichment
of CD133, Par3, Par6 and integrins (α2 and α3 integrins
were induced but not β6 integrin) in the lipid rafts in
U87MG, DLD1 and H1299 cells, but not NCI-N87 and
MCF7 cells (Figure 5A). After wounding, two CD133
mutants, CD133ΔC3-7 (defective association with lipid
rafts) and CD133ΔC11 (defective association with
Src; Src kinase interacts with and phosphorylates the
cytoplasmic domain of CD133 [8, 25]) did not show
lipid raft coalescence (Figure 5B). Of the inhibitors
tested, a lipid raft-destabilizing drug (MβCD), an aPKC
inhibitor (Gö6983), a Src inhibitor (PP2), and siRNA
targeting Par3 and Par6 (perturbed lipid raft coalescence
and cell polarization) decreased localization of integrins
(α2 and α3 integrins) into the raft fractions (Figure 5C).
By contrast, neither PI3K (LY294002) nor MAPK
(PD98059) inhibitors had any effect.
To determine whether the formation of polarized
CD133/integrin, and the resultant lipid raft coalescence,
is required for β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity
and the CSC phenotype, we evaluated the response to
wounding by cells expressing a CD133 mutant or were
pretreated with an inhibitor. After wounding, wild-type
CD133+ cells cultured on collagen-coated dishes showed
enhanced TOPflash reporter activity (Figure 5D) and selfrenewal of sphere-forming cells (Figure 5E). Pretreatment
with inhibitors or mutants that disrupt CD133/integrin
polarization (siRNA against Par3 and Par6) and lipid raft
coalescence [CD133ΔC3, CD133ΔC7, CD133ΔC3-7,
and CD133ΔC11 mutants; a lipid raft-destabilizing drug
(MβCD); siRNA against Src; an aPKC inhibitor (Gö6983),
and a Src inhibitor (PP2)] abolished CD133-mediated
β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity (Figure 5D)
and the CSC phenotype (Figure 5E). These results indicate

Because the mode of cell division in CSCs is
critically important, we used pulse-chase BrdU labeling
and paired-cell assays to investigate cell division in
cancer cells [26]. To determine whether ACD is CD133/
integrin dependent, we chased BrdU-labeled CD133+
cells cultured on ECM-coated dishes before/after
wounding. The frequency of ACD in U87MG, DLD1
and H1299 cells cultured on collagen- or laminincoated dishes after wounding ranged from about 65%
to 85%, which was higher than the ACD frequencies
in NCI-N87 (~40–50%) and MCF7 (~20–40%) cells
cultured on poly-d-lysine- or fibronectin-coated dishes
after wounding (Figure 6A). When 2 weeks of pulsing
was followed by a chase period of 0–30 days, ~25% of
U87MG, DLD1, and H1299 cells cultured on collagenor laminin-coated dishes after wounding retained CD133+
(Figure 6B). The percentage of CD133+ NCI-N87 and
MCF7 cells cultured on poly-d-lysine- or fibronectincoated dishes after wounding began to decline within
16 days during the chase period and had fallen to 1–2%
after 30 days (Figure 6B). These results suggest that
CD133 is distributed symmetrically in cells cultured
on poly-d-lysine- or fibronectin-coated dishes and that
induction of differentiation generates CD133− cells.
CD133-mediated collagen/laminin-triggered signaling
maintained the CSC population in U87MG, DLD1 and
H1299 cells. These results were confirmed by the effect
of domain mapping CD133 on ACD. Cells expressing
CD133ΔC3, CD133ΔC7, CD133ΔC3-7 or CD133ΔC11
did not show a higher frequency of ACD (Figure 6C).
Of the inhibitors tested, a lipid raft-destabilizing drug
(MβCD), an aPKC inhibitor (Gö6983), a Src inhibitor
(PP2) and siRNA targeting Par3 and Par6 disrupted ACD
(Figure 6D). By contrast, neither PI3K (LY294002) nor
MAPK (PD98059) inhibitors had any effect.

Polarized CD133-mediated signaling that
mediates the noncanonical Wnt pathway is
dependent on the CD133/Src/Akt/GSK3β/
β-catenin axis
Using FACS with monoclonal antibodies that
specifically recognized Src-PY418, Akt-PS473 and
GSK3β-PS9, we observed robust activation of Src, Akt
and GSK3β in CD133+ U87MG, DLD1 and H1299 cells,
but these kinases were not activated in CD133+ NCI-N87
and MCF7 cells (Figure 7A–7C). To further define the

pretreated with inhibitors of Src (PP2), PI3K (LY294002)
or MAPK (PD98059), with the canonical Wnt pathway
antagonist DKK1 or SFRP1, or with siRNA targeting Src
or β-catenin. Pretreatment with inhibitors that perturb the
CD133/integrin/Src/Akt/GSK3βaxis abolished CD133mediated β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity
(Figure 7F) and the CSC phenotype (Figure 7G), whereas
the canonical Wnt antagonists, DKK1 and SFRP1, did
not. This suggests polarized CD133/integrin-evoked Src
activation (in cells cultured on collagen- or laminin-coated
dishes) enhanced phosphorylation of GSK3β and its
potential upstream regulator Akt as well as the subsequent
increase and nuclear translocation of β-catenin.

SP cells (cells with CSC properties). After wounding,
the SP cell fraction was increased among CD133+ cells
cultured on collagen-coated dishes (Figure 8D), as was
the fraction expressing ABC transporter family members
(Figure 8E–8G). By contrast, no increases in SP cells
or ABC transporter expression were seen in Mock and
CD133+ cells cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes
after wounding. Likewise, cells expressing CD133ΔC3,
ΔC7, ΔC3-7 or ΔC11 of did not exclude Hoechst dye
(Figure 8D) or show increased expression of ABC
transporter family members (Figure 8E–8G). However,
cells expressing CD133 WT, ΔE5 or ΔE9 showed a 2to 6-fold increase in SP cells (Figure 8D) and increased
expression of ABCA3, ABCC1 and ABCG2 (Figure 8E–
8G). Moreover, pretreatment with inhibitors that perturb
CD133/integrin polarization or the CD133/integrin/Src/
Akt/GSK3β/β-cateninaxis abolished CD133-induced
increases in SP cells and ABC transporter levels, though
the canonical Wnt antagonists DKK1 and SFRP1 did not.

Expression and polarization of CD133 enhances
tumorigenesis in experimental animal models
The in vivo tumorigenicity of CD133 was assessed
in mice subcutaneously injected with 103 or 104 CD133+
that had been cultured on collagen-coated dishes,
wounded, and then transfected with siRNA targeting
CD133, Par3 or β-catenin, or CD133− cells transfected
with WT CD133 or various CD133 mutants. As shown
in Figure 9A, CD133−/CD133(WT) and CD133+/ContsiRNA cells, which retain CSC properties in vitro,
were highly tumorigenic in vivo. Forty-two days after
injection of 104 cells expressing CD133(WT), CD133ΔE5
or CD133+/Cont-siRNA six of six animals exhibited
tumors with an average volume of 1389 ± 236, 1344 ±
123 and 1423 ± 215 mm3, respectively. By contrast, no
tumors were observed after injection of cells expressing
CD133ΔC3-7 or siRNA targeting CD133, Par3 or
β-catenin (Figure 9B–9C). The cells with the highest
tumorigenic potential expressed CD133(WT), CD133ΔE5
and CD133+/Cont-siRNA [five (356 ± 177), five (321 ±
159) and six (459 ± 123) of six animals, respectively,
injected with 103 cells formed tumors] (Figure 9D). Mice
injected with cells negative for these proteins did not
develop tumors.

Polarized cell migration-induced CD133/
integrin/Src/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis is
required for maintenance of CSC properties
We hypothesized that CD133 acts to maintain
stem-like properties in polarized migrating cells and
induces differentiation. Wounding CD133+ cells cultured
on collagen-coated dishes induced expression of stem
cell-related genes (including Oct4, Sox2 and ALDH),
whereas wounding Mock and CD133+ cells cultured
on fibronectin-coated dishes did not (Figure 8A–8C).
Likewise, in cells expressing CD133ΔC3, CD133ΔC7,
CD133ΔC3-7 or CD133ΔC11, wounding did not
increase expression of stem cell-related genes. On the
other hand, cells expressing CD133WT, CD133ΔE5
or CD133ΔE9 showed a ~5-15-fold increase in
expression of stem cell-related genes. To determine
whether signaling in the CD133/integrin/Src/Akt/
GSK3β/β-catenin axis is required for maintenance of
CSC properties, cells were pretreated with inhibitors
as described in Figure 5C. Pretreatment with inhibitors
that perturb CD133/integrin polarization or the CD133/
integrin/Src/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis abolished the
CD133-induced increase in stem cell-related gene
expression (Figure 8A–8C) and the maintenance of
CSC properties (Figure 8D), but the canonical Wnt
antagonists DKK1 and SFRP1 did not.
Using FACS to assess Hoechst dye exclusion and
expression of ABC transporter family members, we next
asked whether CD133-expressing cancer cells generated

DISCUSSION
CD133 often localizes at plasma membrane
protrusions and may influence cell polarity and migration
[27]. Our wounding assay revealed that cell migration
triggers coalescence of lipid rafts on the plasma
membrane, resulting in local enrichment of CD133, Par3,
Par6 and integrins on the leading edge. The Par3-Par6aPKC complex has long been known to regulate the

of microtubules [11], thereby controlling ACD. The
function of CD133 during cellular polarization is less
well-defined [14]. Because the CD133 mutants used in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

our study failed to induce coalescence of lipid rafts and
resulted in a significantly lower incidence of ACD, we
hypothesize that CD133 is also an important contributor
to the establishment of cell polarity. CD133 congregates

at membrane microdomains that are enriched with
sphingolipids and involved in signaling pathways [5], and
loss of these CD133-rich microdomains during ACD may
lead to cell differentiation [6]. These findings suggest that
the polarized distribution of CD133 in a migrating cell
may direct that cell toward ACD, renewing the CD133+
parental cell while giving rise to a differentiated CD133−
daughter cell.
We observed that CD133 mediated ACD and
sustained CSC properties in brain, colon and lung cancer
cells, but not in gastric or breast cancer cells. CD133 has
been used to identify CSCs since it was first reported to
be enriched in human brain tumor cells exhibiting an
enhanced capacity for self-renewal, proliferation and
differentiation [28]. Controversies nonetheless abound
regarding the suitability of CD133 to serve as a sole
marker for cells with stem-like characteristics. For
example, a recent review stated that although CSCs can
be purified from CD133+ subpopulations in lung, colon,
liver, pancreas and skin cancers, CD133 appears to be a
general marker for the apical or apicolateral membrane and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cannot be used alone to isolate stem cells rich in glandular
epithelia, such as from the stomach or the breast [29].
Our  experiments also leave some doubt as to whether
CD133 positivity properly selected CSCs from among the
gastric and breast cancer cells used.
In various types of cancer, the presence of
CD133+ subpopulations correlates with strong resis­
tance to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [30]. Clini­
copathological studies have also found that CD133
positivity is associated with more aggressive tumor
types [31], advanced stage disease [32] and metastasis
[33]. Overall, high CD133 levels portend an unfavorable
prognosis [32–34], and several publications have linked
a decrease in CD133+ cells to reduced tumorigenicity
[35–37]. For that reason, strategies have been devised to
target CD133 as one approach to cancer treatment. The
mechanism by which CD133 facilitates maintenance of
CSCs and increases tumorigenicity is not fully understood.
It has been proposed that molecular events downstream
of CD133 activation include PI3K/Akt activation [9],
Hedgehog-GLI1 signaling [37] and Src activation [8, 25].

Figure 10: A model for functional cooperation between CD133/integrin and Par complexes in migration. In migrating

cells, CD133/integrin and Par complexes are recruited to the leading edge of cells to increase Src activity, which enhances CD133/integrin
signaling and ACD. In response to directional cues (e.g., integrin activation during migration), polarization of CD133 localization induces
lateral reorganization of lipids and membrane-associated proteins. A complex composed of integrin, Src and Par is enriched in lipid rafts, and
the assembly and activation of this signaling complex leads to Src activation. CD133-induced Src activation enhances the phosphorylation
of GSK3β and its potential upstream regulator, Akt. The subsequent increase and nuclear translocation of β-catenin may be a regulatory
switch that increases drug resistance and stemness properties in cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our present study establishes that a CD133/integrin/Src/
Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis and noncanonical Wnt signaling
are activated in migrating CSCs, which contributes to a
rationale for targeting CD133 in cancer treatment.
Based on our results, we propose the following.
In migrating cells, CD133/integrin and Par complexes
are recruited to the leading edge of cells to increase
Src activity, which enhances CD133/integrin signaling
and ACD. In response to directional cues (e.g., integrin
activation during migration), polarization of CD133
localization induces lateral reorganization of lipids and
membrane-associated proteins. A complex composed of
integrin, Src and Par is enriched in lipid rafts, and the
assembly and activation of this signaling complex lead to
Src activation. CD133-induced Src activation enhances
the phosphorylation of GSK3β and its potential upstream
regulator, Akt. The subsequent increase and nuclear
translocation of β-catenin may be a regulatory switch
that increases drug resistance and stemness properties in
cancer cells (Figure 10). The present study demonstrates
for the first time the contribution made by CD133 to
tumor formation and progression in a model where
multiple phenotypic cancer cell subpopulations coexist
in dynamic equilibrium and where the tumorigenic and
metastatic properties of subsets of cells, including CSCs,
can be tested concurrently to identify their functional and
hierarchical relationships.

Wild-type CD133 was purchased from Genediscovery
Biotechnology. CD133 mutants with deletions [CD133ΔC3
(deletion of amino acid 130 to 157), CD133ΔE5 (deletion

Spheres were generated as previously described [23].
Briefly, cells were grown in suspension culture (1,000 cells/ml)
using ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) and serum-free
RPMI (ATCC) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/
ml EGF and 10 ng/ml bFGF (BD Biosciences). Spheres with
a diameter > 30 μm were then counted. For serial passages
(self-renewal capability assays), spheres were harvested
and dissociated to single cells with trypsin, after which the
dissociated cells were plated in a 96-well plate (diluted to 1
cell/well in an ultra-low attachment plate) and cultured for 12
days. The spheres were then counted again. The individual
spheres were found to be derived from single cells [42].

Human samples and IHC analysis

Identification and isolation of side-population
(SP) cells

Sectioned human lung cancer specimens were
obtained from GenDiscovery Biotechnology, Inc. Human
breast cancer specimens were from Chang-Gung University
College of Medicine and Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan.
All samples were made anonymous prior to analysis.
Studies involving these tissues were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at Chang-Gung University
College of Medicine and Memorial Hospital. All staining
procedures were performed using a Super Sensitive IHC
Detection Systems kit (BioGenex). Counterstaining was
performed with hematoxylin. A semi-quantitative method
for calculating positive signals was used. Signals were
counted in six fields per sample under a light microscope
at 400× magnification. The results were evaluated by two
independent observers to determine both the percentage of
positive cells and the staining intensity, as described [39, 40].
The observers were blinded to the stage of each sample. The
IHC score was obtained by multiplying the staining intensity
(0 = no expression, 1 = weak expression, 2 = moderate
expression, 3 = strong expression and 4 = very strong
expression) by the percentage of positive cells (0 = 0–5%
expression, 1 = 6–25% expression, 2 = 26–50% expression,
3 = 51–75% expression, and 4 = 76–100% expression) in
the field. The maximum possible IHC score was 4 × 4 = 16.

SP cells were determined as described [23]. Cells were
suspended in prewarmed RPMI containing 2% FBS and 10
mM HEPES, and were stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342
dye (Molecular Probes) for 90 min at 37°C with or without
100 μM reserpine, which is an inhibitor of some ATP-binding
cassette transporters. Cells were then washed and resuspended
in HBSS containing 2% FBS and 10 mM HEPES. Before cell
sorting, 0.25 μg/ml 7-AAD (Sigma) was added to exclude
nonviable cells. The concentration of Hoechst 33342 and the
incubation times were initially identified using samples that
provided the highest frequency of SP cells with the lowest
cytotoxicity determined by 7-AAD staining. SP cells were
analyzed on a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer
equipped with 450/20 nm band pass and 670 nm long pass
optical filters (Omega Optical).

Adhesion assay
Adhesion of cells to plates coated with 10 μg/mL
fibronectin, 10 μg/mL collagen, 2 μg/mL laminin, 2 mg/
mL poly-d-lysine or 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum
albumin in PBS was assessed as described [24, 43]. To
obtain a reference value of 100% attachment, cells were
seeded on plates precoated with 20 μg/mL fibronectin.
Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a humidified
incubator followed by immediate fixation. Approximately
90% to 100% of input cells were recovered.

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as described [23].
Images were recorded using a luminescent image analyzer
(FUSION SL; Vilber Lourmat, France), and the intensities
of the bands were quantitated with densitometry using
Bio-1D and Bio-Gene software (Vilber Lourmat).

5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase
and paired-cell assays

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

BrdU was added to the culture medium at a
concentration of 1 μM for 2 weeks to ensure labeling of
all cells. During the pulse, the medium was supplemented
with fresh BrdU every 72 h, and cell growth was
maintained in log phase. The cells were then synchronized
using nocodazole overnight, and flow cytometry was used
to confirm BrdU incorporation. For BrdU chasing, the cells

ChIP was performed as described [39, 41]. Extracted
DNA was analyzed using PCR with primers spanning the
proximal promoter regions of ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGA4,
ITGA10, ITGA11, ITGB1, ITGB6 or ITGB8. Following 30
cycles of amplification, PCR products were run on a 1.5%
agarose gel and analyzed with ethidium bromide staining.

were washed thoroughly, seeded onto coated coverslips in
BrdU-free medium and synchronized using a thymidinenocodazole-blebbistatin sequence to halt the cell cycle at
the second post-BrdU mitosis and paired-cell formation
[26]. The paired cells were fixed and permeabilized,
after which the cells were sequentially immersed in 1 N
HCl followed by 2 N HCl to open the DNA structure.
Immediately after the acid washes, the cells were incubated
at room temperature in 0.1 M sodium borate (pH 8.0), then
washed and incubated overnight with antibodies specific
for BrdU or CSC/differentiation markers.
