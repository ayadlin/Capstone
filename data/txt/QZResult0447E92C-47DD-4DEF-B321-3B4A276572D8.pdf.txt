ABSTRACT
We reported previously that increased expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
(ALDH1) in multiple myeloma (MM) is a marker of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that
is further associated with chromosomal instability (CIN). Here we demonstrate that
member A1 of the ALDH1 family of proteins, ALDH1A1, is most abundantly expressed
in myeloma. Enforced expression of ALDH1A1 in myeloma cells led to increased
clonogenicity, tumor formation in mice, and resistance to myeloma drugs in vitro
and in vivo. The mechanism underlying these phenotypes included the ALDH1A1dependent activation of drug-efflux pump, ABCB1, and survival proteins, AKT and
BCL2. Over expression of ALDH1A1 in myeloma cells led to increased mRNA and
protein levels of NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2), whereas shRNA-mediated knock
down of NEK2 decreased drug efflux pump activity and drug resistance. The activation
of NEK2 in myeloma cells relied on the ALDH1A1-dependent generation of the
retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) ligand, 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA) – not the retinoic acid
receptor α (RARα) ligand, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). These findings implicate the
ALDH1A1-RXRα-NEK2 pathway in drug resistance and disease relapse in myeloma and
suggest that specific inhibitors of ALDH1A1 are worthy of consideration for clinical
development of new approaches to overcome drug resistance in myeloma.

disease resulting in poor clinical outcome, but also
promote acquisition of drug resistance by myeloma
cells. With regard to the mechanism of drug resistance in
myeloma, Greenman et al. implicated deregulated protein
kinases [6]. Additional drivers of drug resistance include
aberrant expression of transcription factors, mutations in
tumor suppressor genes and distorted cell cycle regulation
[7]. Despite these advances, additional research is
warranted to enhance our understanding of the genetic
pathways of myeloma drug resistance.
The recent discovery of drug-resistant tumor
subclones in patients with myeloma [8–10] has shed light
on the long-standing clinical observation that the response
to myeloma chemotherapy is often heterogeneous and

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM), a difficult-to-treat and
in most cases incurable neoplasm of the hematopoietic
bone marrow, is characterized by clonal expansion of
malignant, antibody-producing plasma cells. MM is
the second most common blood cancer, accounts for
~1–2% of newly diagnosed cancers overall, and is
disproportionately represented in the elderly population
[1]. Myeloma cells exhibit numerous gene expression
changes and cytogenetic aberrations that frequently affect
the immunoglobin heavy-chain locus on chromosome
14 as well as loci on chromosomes 1, 13 and 17 [2–5].
Abnormalities of this sort underlie not only aggressive

sometimes even lesion-specific [11]. Overcoming drugresistant myeloma in the clinic is a serious challenge
that requires new approaches based on results from highthroughput proteomic and genetic analysis tools, such as
global gene expression profiling (GEP), RNA sequencing
and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, which
must be combined with sophisticated bioinformatics
and biostatistics algorithms [12]. Our group has recently
performed sequential GEP analysis of myeloma samples
at baseline (newly diagnosed disease), in the course of
high-dose chemotherapy and tandem autologous stem
cell transplantation (ASCT), and at relapse. This effort
uncovered 56 genes tightly associated with drug resistance
and rapid disease relapse in myeloma. Intriguingly, 10 of
the top 20 genes fell into a well-established chromosomal
instability (CIN) signature of cancer [13]. Additionally,
we recently reported that ALDH1, a marker of myeloma
initiating cells (TICs), is also linked to the CIN signature
[14]. High expression of this signature has been shown
to predict poor clinical outcome and confer multidrug
resistance (MDR) to myeloma and other forms of cancer
[13, 15, 16]. The mechanism linking ALDH1 and CIN
with MDR has not yet been established.
The human genome contains 19 aldehyde
dehydrogenase-encoding ALDH genes and 3 pseudogenes
[17]. Aldehyde dehydrogenases are not only crucial for
protecting cells from toxic aldehydes, but are also known
to play important roles in cancer development, retinoic
acid metabolism and drug resistance [17]. For example,
high activity of ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 increases the risk
of ethanol-induced cancers [18, 19]. ALDH2 is required
for embryo survival and early morphogenesis in mice [20].
In humans, deletions of ALDH3A1 or ALDH3A2 cause
Sjogren-Larson syndrome [21]; mutations in ALDH4A1
underlie type II hyperprolinemia [22]; mutations in
ALDH5A14 cause mental retardation, ataxia and
seizures [23]; and allelic variants of ALDH18A1 result in
hyperammonemia [24]. Because of their importance for
drug metabolism and oncogenesis, ALDH1, ALDH2 and
ALDH3 are the most extensively studied members of the
ALDH family of enzymes [25, 26]. Normal cells contain
two ALDH1 isoforms, ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1, but
the expression of these proteins has also been associated
with drug resistance in cancer stem cells (CSCs) [27].
The Aldefluor assay, which permits investigators to
detect and separate ALDH1-expressing cells from cells
that lack ALDH1 expression, has led to a wave of cancer
studies that have implicated ALDH1 in drug resistance
of adenocarcinoma of lung [28], melanoma [29], breast
cancer [30] and hematopoietic tumors, such as myeloma
[8, 10].
This study took advantage of the Aldefluor assay
to elucidate the role of ALDH1 in MDR in myeloma in
greater depth. We show that A1 is the dominant isoform
of ALDH1 in MM. Enforced expression of ALDH1A1

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in myeloma cells led to increased activity of the drug
efflux pump, ABCB1, and to more vigorous tumor growth
in mice. We also demonstrate that over-expression of
ALDH1A1 in myeloma leads to elevated NEK2 levels,
using a mechanism that includes 9-cis retinoic aciddependent RXRα signaling [31]. Taken together, our
results support the notion that ALDH1A1 is a promoter of
drug resistance in myeloma that is worthy of consideration
for therapeutic targeting in order to overcome MDR and
improve the outcome of patients with myeloma.

RESULTS
Increased expression of ALDH1A1 in serial
myeloma samples from the same patients
To evaluate whether the expression of ALDH1
exhibits changes in the course of myeloma therapy and
disease progression, we queried the mRNA levels of
the three most well-studied members of the ALDH1
gene family, ALDH1A1, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1A3, in
9 patients with myeloma for which the following four
serial, microarray-based gene expression profiles (GEPs)
were available: at diagnosis, prior to the first and second
autologous stem cell transplant, and after the second
transplant. Message levels of ALDH1A1, but not of the
other family members, increased substantially in 9 of
9 (100%) patients (Figure 1A-C). This result not only
indicated that ALDH1A1 is the predominant form of
ALDH1 in myeloma, but also suggested that the gene
is upregulated in response to standard-of-care myeloma
therapy. Next, we sought to determine whether ALDH1A1
is also the chief representative of the ALDH1 family in two
human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) that were selected
for mechanistic studies on myeloma drug resistance:
ARP1 and OPM1. We took advantage of the Aldefluor®
assay, which relies on flow sorting to fractionate cells that
exhibit ALDH1 activity (designated ALDH1+) from cells
that do not (ALDH1-) [14], to separate ARP1 and OPM1
cells according to ALDH1 status and then used qPCR
analysis to show that ALDH1A1 is more highly expressed
in ALDH1+ than ALDH1- cells (Figure 1D). Differences of
this sort were not observed for ALDH1B1 and ALDH1A3
(not shown). This finding encouraged us to use ARP1 and
OPM1 cells as experimental model system to evaluate
the mechanisms by which ALDH1A1 promotes drug
resistance in myeloma.

Over-expression of ALDH1A1 promotes
resistance to myeloma drugs in vitro
To assess whether enforced expression of ALDH1A1
in myeloma cells leads to heightened tolerance to myeloma
drugs in vitro, we transduced ARP1 and OPM1 cells
with a lentivirus-delivered, EF1-alpha promoter-driven

expected, western analysis demonstrated over-expression
of ALDH1A1 protein in both cell lines (designated
ARP1OE and OPM1OE) compared to controls transduced
with non-coding “empty vector” (designated ARP1EV and
OPM1EV, Figure 2A). Next, we employed the eFluxx-ID™
multidrug resistance assay to evaluate the possibility that
up-regulation of ALDH1A1 leads to increased drug efflux
activity in myeloma. Cells were treated with specific
inhibitors of 3 different drug export pumps; i.e., verapamil
for ABCB1, MK-571 for ABCC1, and Novobiocin for
ABCG2, or left untreated (control). Under conditions of
ABCB1 (but not ABCC1 or ABCG2) inhibition, ARP1OE
and OPM1OE cells exhibited significantly greater drug
efflux activity than ARP1EV and OPM1EV cells: the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) increased by 50 and 32 units,
respectively (Figure 2B). The finding suggested that
ALDH1A1 enhanced the drug export activity of myeloma
cells in an ABCB1-dependent manner. Next we performed

soft-agar colony formation assays to assess the possibility
that ALDH1A1 promotes drug resistance in myeloma.
Figure 2C shows that ARP1OE and OPM1OE cells were less
sensitive to bortezomib (Bz) and doxorubicin (Dox) than
ARP1EV and OPM1EV cells. Flow cytometric determination
of immunoreactivity to annexin V, a marker of apoptotic
cell death, revealed the same picture, as treatment of cells
for 48 hrs with Bz (4 nM or 8 nM) or Dox (50 nM or
100 nM) caused less death in the “OE” than “EV” sample
(Figure 2D). The results presented in panels C and D lent
further support to the contention that ALDH1A1 renders
myeloma cell drug resistance.

Enforced expression of ALDH1A1 increases
tolerance to myeloma drugs in vivo
To extend these observations to an animal model
of human myeloma, we transferred ARP1OE and ARP1EV
cells to immunodeficient NOD.Cγ Rag1 mice. Starting

on day 7 post transfer of 1.5 × 106 tumor cells, half the
mice were treated with Bz (1 mg/kg, twice weekly IP)
and half were left untreated (control). Figure 3 shows
that 27 days after cell propagation, the ARP1OE tumors
that developed in untreated mice were significantly larger
(2.52 cm3 on average; n = 5) than the ARP1EV tumors
(1.24 cm3). Similarly, in Bz-treated mice, ARP1OE tumors
were larger (2.48 cm3) than ARP1EV tumors (0.57 cm3). We
conclude that treatment with Bz had little if any impact
on ARP1OE tumors (1.6% difference in tumor volume in
treated vs. untreated mice) but was highly effective in case
of ARP1EV tumors (54% difference). This result provided
evidence that up-regulation of ALDH1A1 in myeloma
mitigates the response to treatment with proteasome
inhibitor.

and inferior survival in patients with MM [14],
we decided to explore whether NEK2 might be involved
in the mechanism by which ALDH1A1 promotes
drug resistance in myeloma. NEK2 gene expression
was found significantly higher in ALDH1+ than in
ALDH1- MM cells, fractionated by using Aldefluor®based cell sorting from 3 MM lines [14]. qPCR analysis
confirmed this finding (Figure 4A) and further
demonstrated that high expression of NEK2 is also
a feature of ARP1OE / OPM1OE relative to ARP1EV /
OPM1EV  cells (Figure 4B). Because NEK2 promotes
drug resistance by virtue of activating the myeloma
drug efflux pump, ABCB1, in dependence on pAKT and
pBCL2 levels [14], we decided to compare the level of
these proteins in ARP1 and OPM2 cells that either overexpressed ALDH1A1 (OE) or transfected with empty
vector (EV). Figure 4C shows that compared to EV
cells, OE cells harbored higher levels of NEK2, ABCB1,
pAKT and pBCL2 by western blotting. To further validate
the involvement of NEK2 in ALDH1A1-induced drug
resistance, NEK2-targeting shRNA was transduced into

promoter and NEK2 coding region. This revealed a
significant footprint of retinoic X receptor alpha (RXRα)
binding in 4 of 4 cell lines for which this information was
available: GM78, hESC, HepG and SKSH (Figure 6A).
Because RXRα is the receptor for 9-cis retinoic acid
(9CRA), an important ligand of the cellular RXRα signal
transduction pathway, the ChIP-Seq result suggested that
ALDH1A1 regulates NEK2 transcription by generating
9CRA. To follow up on this hypothesis, we treated APR1
and OPM1 cells for 4 or 8 hrs with 5nM 9CRA in vitro.
qPCR analysis demonstrated heightened expression of
NEK2 in all cases, with a particularly strong increase in
the 4-hr ARP1 sample (Figure 6B). Western blotting of
whole cell lysates after treatment of cells with 5nM 9CRA
for 48 hrs confirmed the PCR result at the protein level
(Figure 6C). The data presented in Figure 6 lends credence
to a model that implicates RXRα/9CRA-dependent
transactivation of NEK2 in myeloma drug resistance

ALDH1A1-overexpressing ARP1 and OPM1 cells. In both
cases, this led to reduced levels of NEK2, ABCB1, pAKT
and pBCL2 proteins by western analysis (Figure 5A),
decreased activity of the drug efflux pump by eFluxx-ID
analysis (Figure 5B) and lessened colony formation upon
treatment with bortezomib (5nM) or without treatment
(Figure 5C). The apparent association of high ALDH1A1
and NEK2 levels is consistent with the hypothesis
that NEK2 contributes to ALDH1A1-dependent drug
resistance in myeloma.

DISCUSSION

of patients with myeloma [13]. More recently, we
showed that ALDH1 is a marker of tumor initiating
cells and drug resistance in myeloma, and that the
CIN signature is more highly expressed in ALDH1+
than ALDH1- myeloma cells [14]. Consistent with
that, CD138-ALDH1+ cells were found to be more
clonogenic and tumorigenic than CD138+ALDH1cells [33]. Because ALDH1 positivity, as determined
by Aldefluor analysis, reflects the combined output of
different aldehyde dehydrogenase activities – namely
ALDH1A1, ALDH1B1 and ALDH1A3 et al. – we here
dissected the ALDH1+ phenotype and demonstrated that
ALDH1A1 is the predominant isoform in myeloma.
Additionally, we showed that enforced expression of
ALDH1A1 in two myeloma cell lines (ARP1, OPM1)
led to both increased clono- and tumorigenicity and

MM is a difficult-to-treat malignancy of
terminally differentiated B-lymphocytes that exhibits
complex genetic/epigentic abnormalities and frequently
evolves into treatment-refractory fatal disease [9].
Karyotypic changes are detected in ~30% of newly
diagnosed patients, with number and complexity of
changes correlating with disease stage, prognosis
and response to therapy [32]. Comparing microarraybased gene expression profiles of myeloma samples
serially collected from the same patients at different
disease progression and treatment stages, we found
the chromosomal instability (CIN) gene signature
strongly increased after induction chemo- and tandem
ASCT therapy, and tightly linked to poor prognosis

heightened tolerance to two widely used myeloma
drugs (bortezomib, doxorubicin).
Our previous study demonstrated that as many as
5 of 17 genes found to be significantly up-regulated in
ALDH1+ myeloma cells encode cell cycle-dependent
protein kinases; specifically, CDC2, TTK, AURKA,
AURKB and, of importance here, NEK2 [14]. Because
cell cycle-dependent protein kinases are thought
to be a major underlying reason for CIN and drug
resistance in cancer [13, 14, 34], we hypothesized
that NEK2 might be involved in the mechanism by
which ALDH1A1 promotes therapy resistance in
myeloma. This hypothesis was in line with evidence
that up-regulation of NEK2 in myeloma prognosticates
inferior survival and is strongly associated with CIN
and drug resistance [13]. We found that ALDH1A1
induced NEK2 expression at the mRNA and protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels. Furthermore, shRNA-dependent “knockdown”
of NEK2 led to a drop of proteins crucial for cellular
drug export (ABCB1) and survival (pAKT, pBCL2).
Considering that NEK2 activates AKT and ABCB1
in myeloma [13], it is possible that ALDH1A1
promotes drug resistance by activating the NEK2AKT pathway. It is also possible that the activation
(phosphorylation) of BCL2 in ALDH1+ myeloma
cells is a consequence of heightened CIN-NEK2AKT signaling. BCL2 is a pro-survival protein that
protects myeloma cells from drug-induced death [35]
and is often over-expressed in cancer cells exhibiting
the CIN phenotype, even though it should be down
regulated following drug-dependent mitotic arrest [15,
36, 37]. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate
the regulation of BCL2 in response to CIN-NEK2-AKT
activation.

ALDH1A1 catalyzes the oxidation of retinal
(retinaldehyde) to the corresponding retinoic acid (RA)
[38], which – upon binding to retinoic acid receptors (RAR)
and/or retinoid X receptors (RXR) – initiates downstream
RA signaling. ALDH1A1-dependent generation of RA is
important for growth and differentiation of normal and
malignant cells [38, 39], including normal hematopoietic
stem cells [38]. In embryonic cancer/stem cells and
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, RA signaling has
been linked to CIN, based on increased occurrence of
micronuclei and decreased expression of survivin [40].
Since ALDH1A1 generates two different RAs – the
widely known all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the lesser
known 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA) – and our previous
work on myeloma pointed to ATRA as an important
signaling ligand [39], this research concentrated initially
on ATRA. However, treatment of myeloma cells with
ATRA left NEK2 levels unchanged upon qPCR analysis
(data not shown). We also investigated whether enforced
up-regulation of the ATRA receptor, RARα, might make
a difference – because RARα2 (not RARα1) is important
for myeloma [39, 41], we used RARα2 for that purpose.
We found no change in NEK2 using qPCR and western
analyses (results not shown). These findings indicated that
ATRA is not involved in the mechanism by which ALDH1
regulates NEK2 and led us to refocus attention on 9CRA.
This resulted in the discovery that ALDH1A1 promotes
NEK2 transcription in a 9CRA/RXRα-dependent fashion.
The result is in agreement with ChIP-Seq data gathered
by other investigators, demonstrating NEK2 promoter
occupancy by the 9CRA-specific receptor, RXRα, in
different four cell lines.
In conclusion, this study implicates ALDH1A1
as an important drug resistance and tumor progression
gene in multiple myeloma. The mechanism of
ALDH1A1 includes up-regulation and activation
of NEK2, AKT and BCL2, but many details remain
outstanding. Small-drug inhibitors that specifically
target ALDH1A1 may be considered for therapeutic
regimens aimed at overcoming drug resistance in
myeloma.

million cells were re-suspended in 1mL assay buffer and
incubated with activated ALDEFLUOR substrate (5 µL)

Total RNA was extracted with the assistance
of a RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and reverse

Clonogenic growth was evaluated in 12-well plates
after seeding 10,000 myeloma cells in 0.5 mL 0.33% agar/
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
10% FCS. Cells were incubated (37°C, 5% CO2) and fed
with the same medium twice in the first week, and then
treated with drugs or left untreated (control) for another
2 weeks. One colony was defined if more than 40 cells
were observed. Plates were imaged and colonies were
enumerated using Image J freeware. The latter entailed
threshold adjustment using the Adjust Manu bar followed
by colony counting using the Measure Manu bar [13].

re-suspended in cold PBS for flow analysis, using MCF7
cells as reference.

Gene expression profiling (GEP) and data
analysis

Human myeloma xenografts in mice
All animal work was performed in accordance
with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Iowa under Animal
Study Protocol 1202033. ARP1-ALDH1A1OE cells and
ARP1EV cells (1.5 × 106) were injected subcutaneously in
the abdominal area of 6–8-week old NOD.Cγ -Rag1 mice
(Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine). Beginning on
day 7 post cell transfer, mice were treated with bortezomib
(1 mg/kg IP) twice weekly until humane endpoints were
reached. Tumor volume was measured using a caliper and
mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation when tumor
diameter reached 20 mm.

GEP was performed on Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0
microarrays as previously described [13, 42]. GEP access
number of primary myeloma sequential samples reported
in this paper is GSE19554.

Lentiviral gene transduction
Lentivirus containing cDNA gene expression
or shRNA knockdown cassettes was constructed as
described previously [43, 44]. The plasmid containing
the human ALDH1A1 full-length open-reading frame,
NM_000689, was provided by Health Sciences Center
(HSC) Core Research Facilities, University of Utah.
Primer sequences for PCR-based cloning of ALDH1A1
cDNA were as follows: 5’-GGG GTT TAA ACA TGT
CAT CCT CAG GCA CGC CAG AG-3’ (forward) and
5’- GGG GTT TAA ACT TAT GAG TTC TTC TGA GAG
ATT TTC ACT GTG AC-3’ (reverse). The ALDH1A1
coding sequence was cloned into the lentiviral vector,
pWPI. NEK2-targeted shRNA was cloned into vector,
pLVTH, using the following PCR primers: 5’-GAT CCC
CGG AGG AAG AGT GAT GGC AAG ATT CAA GAG
ATC TTG CCA TCA CTC TTC CTC CTT TTT A-3’ and
a nonsense scrambled oligonucleotide (5’-GAT CCC
CGA CAC GCG ACT TGT ACC ACT TCA AGA GAG
TGG TAC AAG TCG CGT GTC TTT TTA-3’) were
obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville,
IA). Recombinant lentivirus was produced in 293T cells.
Transduction efficiency, determined by flow cytometry of
fluorescent reporter gene, was ~95%.

Statistical analysis
All values were analyzed using two-tailed Student’s
t-test and expressed as mean ± SD. A p value of 5%
(*, P < 0.05) was considered significant.

Apoptosis and dye-efflux multidrug-resistance
assays
Programmed cell death was determined with the
help of the flow-cytometric Annexin V apoptosis detection
kit APC (catalog number 88–8007) from eBioscience
(San Diego, CA). One million cells were washed in PBS
and suspended in 1 mL binding buffer. Fluorochromeconjugated antibody to Annexin V (5 μL) was added to the
cell suspension (100 μL). Cells were incubated for 15 min
at room temperature, washed and re-suspended in binding
buffer and subjected to flow analysis. Drug resistance was
measured using the eFluxx-ID™ Multidrug resistance
assay as previously described [13]. Briefly, 500,000 cells
were incubated (30 min, 37°C, water bath) with detection
reagent, Golden dye, either with specific inhibitors of
