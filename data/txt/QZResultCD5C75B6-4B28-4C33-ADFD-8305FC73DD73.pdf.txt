Abstract
MYC is a potential target for many cancers but is not amenable to existing pharmacologic approaches.
Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) by statins has shown
potential efficacy against a number of cancers. Here, we show that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by
atorvastatin (AT) blocks both MYC phosphorylation and activation, suppressing tumor initiation and growth
in vivo in a transgenic model of MYC-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as in human HCC-derived
cell lines. To confirm specificity, we show that the antitumor effects of AT are blocked by cotreatment with the
HMG-CoA reductase product mevalonate. Moreover, by using a novel molecular imaging sensor, we confirm
that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks MYC phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, the introduction of
phosphorylation mutants of MYC at Ser62 or Thr58 into tumors blocks their sensitivity to inhibition of HMGCoA reductase. Finally, we show that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses MYC phosphorylation
through Rac GTPase. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase is a critical regulator of MYC phosphorylation, activation,
and tumorigenic properties. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may be a useful target for the treatment of
MYC-associated HCC as well as other tumors. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2286–97. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and generally incurable malignancies with an estimated
9% 5-year survival rate (1). Hepatocellular carcinogenesis is
strongly associated with hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and
HCV) infection and other pathologic conditions resulting in
liver regeneration (2), which, in turn, facilitates the activation
of specific oncogenes, most notably MYC (c-MYC; 3). Thus,
targeted inactivation of MYC may be an effective therapy for
HCC (4–6). Indeed, we have reported recently that the conditional inactivation of MYC can be sufficient to induce
sustained regression of HCC (7). However, there is no existing
therapy that targets MYC for the treatment of any cancer.

The MYC protooncogene family is composed of c-MYC,
N-MYC, and L-MYC and has been shown to impact almost
every aspect of tumorigenesis, including promoting unrestricted cell proliferation, inhibiting cell differentiation, reducing cell adhesion, and enhancing metastasis, genomic
instability, and angiogenesis (8, 9). MYC functions as an
oncogene upon overexpression, either due to increased
expression of the myc gene or due to increased stability
of the MYC protein. MYC protein stability is regulated as
follows (10): through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome
pathway and the sequential phosphorylation of MYC at
serine 62 (S62) and threonine 58 (T58). The phosphorylation
of S62 is mediated by the MAPK/ERK (mitogen activated
protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase)
pathway and contributes to the stabilization of MYC.
Subsequent phosphorylation of T58, mediated by GSK3b,
promotes ubiquitin-dependent MYC degradation once
S62 is dephosphorylated (11–13). Mutations in these phosphorylation sites that stabilize MYC protein have been
identified in human cancers, thereby highlighting the
importance of S62 and T58 phosphorylation as regulators
of MYC in tumorigenesis (14, 15). Hence, targeting MYC
phosphorylation could be useful as an anticancer therapy.
The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) controls the rate-limiting step in
the mevalonate (MV) pathway that is essential for cholesterol
biosynthesis (16). Statins were initially utilized to inhibit HMGCoA reductase as a means to reduce the serum cholesterol
level (16). However, many studies have shown that inhibition of

MYC Activity Is Regulated by HMG-CoA Reductase

HMG-CoA reductase also has antitumor efficacy both in vitro
and in vivo in multiple tumor types (17–20), including colorectal cancer (21, 22), breast cancer (23), melanoma (24), and
lymphoma (25). Statins have been suggested to block tumor
cell growth through the inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis, and repression of tumor
metastasis (26).
Statins may mediate their anticancer properties through
inhibition of the synthesis of lipid isoprenoid intermediates,
including farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphate (GGPP), which are produced downstream of
the MV pathway (19). Generally, FPP activates the Ras
GTPase family whereas GGPP activates the Rho/Rac family
by prenylating and anchoring them on the cell membrane
(27). Both Ras (12, 27) and Rho/Rac family members (28) are
required to phosphorylate MYC. Hence, we speculated that
by inhibiting these pathways, statins might therefore block
MYC activation.
Here we show that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by
atorvastatin (AT) inhibits MYC phosphorylation and activation and thereby blocks MYC-induced HCC onset and tumor
maintenance. Moreover, by using a novel molecular imaging
sensor that noninvasively detects MYC phosphorylation, we
found, both in vitro in human HCC cells and in vivo in mice,
that AT inhibits MYC phosphorylation. Furthermore, the
introduction of mutant MYC alleles that cannot be phosphorylated on S62 or T58 prevented AT from inhibiting the in vivo
tumor growth of HCC. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting
that AT may mediate these effects on MYC phosphorylation
and activation by inhibiting Rac GTPase. Therefore, HMG-CoA
reductase seems to be a critical regulator of MYC activation
and may have potent activity against MYC-induced cancers.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies
The antibody to Ki67 was obtained from BD Biosciences; cMYC, Cdk4, E2F1, and Rac1 antibodies were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; phospho-c-MYC was obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology; antibodies to Tubulin and
HA were from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG and sheep anti-rabbit IgG were
obtained from GE Healthcare and biotinylated anti-mouse IgG
was from BD Biosciences.
Cell lines
The Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection originally characterized by
DNA profile and cytogenetic analysis and were passaged for
less than 6 months in vitro.
Transgenic mice
The Tet System was used previously to generate transgenic
mice that conditionally express human c-MYC cDNA in
hepatocytes, as described (7). MYC expression was induced
by removing doxycycline (Dox, 100 mg/mL) from the drinking
water of mice. All animals were maintained and treated in
accordance with the policies of Stanford University.

AT treatment
AT (prescription formulation; Pfizer Inc.) was resuspended in PBS. It was administered orally in 100 mg/kg
doses with or without 20 mg/kg MV 3 times a week, using 20mm feeding needles (Popper and Sons). PBS was administered as a negative control. Purified AT (Sequoia Research
Products) resuspended in 100% DMSO was used for in vitro
studies.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded
in paraffin. Sections of 5 mm were stained with hematoxylineosin (H&E) or analyzed by immunohistochemistry using the
antibody to Ki67. DAB (3,30 -diaminobenzidine; Vector Laboratories) was used to achieve color development.
Proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5,000 cells/well) and
incubated overnight. Next, cells were treated with PBS, AT (0.5,
1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, or 25 mmol/L), 10 or 25 mmol/L AT and 100
mmol/L MV, 10 or 25 mmol/L AT and 10 mmol/L FPP, or 10 or
25 mmol/L AT and 10 mmol/L GGPP for 96 hours. Cell
proliferation was evaluated using the MTT assay. Data were
from 6 replicated experiments.
Quantitative real-time PCR
HCC cells were treated with PBS, 20 ng/mL Dox, 10 mmol/L
AT, or 10 mmol/L AT and 100 mmol/L MV for 24 hours. Total
mRNA from HCC cells was extracted and purified using the
RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen and quantified by spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). cDNA was reverse-transcribed
from 2 mg of total mRNA using oligo-d(T) primers. Real-time
PCR analysis was done in an ABI PRIZM analyzer (Applied
Biosystems).
Cell membrane fractionation and protein isolation
Cells (2  108) were washed 3 times with PBS and extracted
in lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L DTT, pH
7.4). Lysates were centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 40 minutes,
using Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge. The membrane pellet
was solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.15 mol/L
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 C for 30
minutes. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10
minutes, and the supernatant was collected as the membrane
protein fraction.
Viral infection
Ad-c-MYCWT, Ad-c-MYCS62A, and Ad-c-MYCT58A viruses
were kindly provided as a gift from Dr. Rosalie C. Sears
(Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR). Briefly,
Ad-c-MYCWT, Ad-c-MYCS62A, and Ad-c-MYCT58A adenovirus
were cloned by inserting c-MYCWT (Ad-c-MYCWT),
c-MYCS62A (Ad-c-MYCS62A), and c-MYCT58A (Ad-c-MYCT58A)
cDNA into the pADEasy-1 backbone (Stratagene). Transplanted tumor cells were infected as previously described
(29). Briefly, SCID mice were injected with hepatocellular

carcinoma cells isolated from LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC transgenic
mice. Tumor masses were injected at 3 sites with Ad-c-MYCWT
or Ad-c-MYCT58A once every week. Successful infection was
confirmed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) coexpression in
tumors (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9). Mice were
treated with 100 mg/mL Dox to inactivate transgenic MYC
expression. Tumor growth was measured using calipers 3
times a week for 3 weeks after viral injection.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.15 mol/L
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 mg HA antibody. The precipitated
proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with the antibodies indicated in the figures.
Total MYC and phospho-MYC level were detected by immunoblotting, and their optical density (OD) was measured and
normalized to actin band OD. The MYC phosphorylation level
was determined by the ratio between phospho-MYC and total
MYC.
Molecular imaging of MYC phosphorylation
A bioluminescent sensor system that can noninvasively
detect c-MYC phosphorylation was utilized to detect the AT
inhibitory effect in intact cells and living mice. The sensor
system utilizes the fact that S62 phosphorylation of MYC is
required for its interaction with GSK3b and detects the protein
interaction between GSK3b and MYC to indirectly report the
MYC phosphorylation, using a split Firefly luciferase (FL)
complementation system (30). Specific GSK3b and MYC
fragments are fused with the inactive C-terminal and N-terminal fragment of the split FL, respectively (GSK35-433-CFL/
NFL-c-Myc). Phosphorylation-induced interaction between
GSK3b and MYC brings the 2 split fragments into close
proximity and recovery of the luciferase activity.
The sensor system has been validated both in intact cells
and in mouse xenograft model, which is described in an
independent article (31). For in vitro imaging, the sensor
plasmids were transiently transfected into HuH7 and
HepG2 cells, using Superfect (Qiagen) and Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) reagent, respectively. Renilla luciferase
(RL) gene was cotransfected for the control of the transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells
were treated with AT with different concentration as indicated for 18 hours. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was
conducted in IVIS 50 (Caliper Life Science) after adding
45 mg/mL D-Luciferin (Promega) to the cells. Cells were
lysed for RL assay (Promega) and Western blotting analysis
after imaging. For in vivo liver tumor imaging, we used
a hydrodynamic injection method as previously described
(32). Briefly, 2 mL of saline solution containing 25 mg of
the MYC sensor plasmid with CMV promoter was injected
into the tail vein within 8 seconds. Mice were imaged
in IVIS 200, 22 hours after injection, based on time
course of the sensor expression as determined in
control experiments (Supplementary Information, Figs. S6
and S7).

Results
Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT suppresses
MYC-induced HCC
The effects of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase were
examined on HCC growth in vitro and in vivo by administering
AT to multiple HCC tumor cell lines derived from the LAPtTA/TRE-MYC transgenic mice, a previously described conditional transgenic model of MYC-induced HCC, using the
Tet-system (7), in addition to human HCC cell lines. The
murine cell lines were all generated from HCC isolated from
dual transgenic animals. These cell lines are dependent upon
high levels of human MYC expression, which can be inactivated upon treatment with Dox. Hence, in these transgenic
tumor-derived cell lines, as a positive control for MYC inactivation, we used Dox to induce the suppression of transgenic
MYC. Doses of AT used for our experiments were comparable
with previously published studies (33, 34). Moreover, as control for nonspecific effects of statins, we confirmed that effects
were reversed with cotreatment with the enzyme product of
HMG-CoA reductase MV. Note that because of marked differences in the pharmacokinetics between mouse and human,
AT doses in mice are approximately 50-fold higher than the
pharmacologically equivalent dose in humans (35, 36).
First, AT inhibited the in vitro proliferation of the MYCinduced murine cell line HCC 3-4 as measured by the MTT
assay (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Information, Fig. S2A; 75%
decrease at 10 mmol/L and 92% decrease at 25 mmol/L AT at 96
hours of AT treatment, P < 0.0001 each). Also, AT decreased
the number of cells in S and G2/M phases from 38% to 26%, as
assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining (Fig. 1B, P ¼ 0.01),
and reduced Ki67 immunofluorescence from 81.4% to 31.2%
following 48 hours of 10 mmol/L AT treatment (Fig. 1C, P <
0.0001). Importantly, the effects of AT on proliferation and
cell-cycle arrest were rescued by cotreatment with MV, the
immediate downstream target of HMG-CoA reductase
(Fig. 1A–C), confirming these effects are specific to inhibition
of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, AT was
found to similarly inhibit proliferation and induce cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis in 2 independently derived murine HCC
cell lines, EC4 and HCC 4-4, in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Information, Figs. S1–S3). Thus, AT inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis of murine HCC tumor
cells in vitro.
Second, AT inhibited the growth of the murine HCC 3-4 cell
line transplanted into syngeneic mice by up to 80% compared
with treatment by PBS or AT and MV (Fig. 1D and E, P ¼
0.0003). Note, that FVB/N mice treated with 100 mg/kg AT did
not exhibit any general toxicity and, in particular, had normal
liver histology and serum bilirubin levels, showing that the
clinical effects are not secondary nonspecific hepatotoxicity
(Supplementary Information, Fig. S4). Therefore, inhibition of
HMG-CoA reductase by AT has potent in vivo antitumor
activity against murine MYC-induced HCC.
Third, we interrogated the ability of AT to suppress growth
in Huh7 cells, a human HCC cell line. AT blocked the in vitro
growth of Huh7 cells over a 96-hour time course (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Information, Fig. S2B; 69% decrease at 10

MYC Activity Is Regulated by HMG-CoA Reductase

Figure 1. Inhibition of HMG-CoA
reductase by AT suppresses
growth of MYC-induced HCC in
vitro and in vivo. A, AT inhibits the
proliferation of a MYC-induced
tumor-derived cell line, HCC 3-4.
MTT assay was conducted every
24 hours for 4 days on HCC cells
treated with 10 mmol/L AT, AT plus
100 mmol/L MV, or DMSO as a

treated with Dox to inactivate
transgenic MYC as a positive

in S phase, P ¼ 0.003) and reducing Ki67 positivity (Fig. 2C;
58% reduction, P < 0.0001) following 48 hours of 10 mmol/L AT

Huh7 cells (Fig. 2D; PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.03; AT vs. AT þ MV, P ¼
0.04; PBS vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.8). Cotreatment with MV blocked
the effects of statin treatment, confirming that the inhibition
of human HCC by AT is specific to the suppression of HMGCoA reductase (Fig. 2A–D).

Finally, we evaluated the ability of HMG-CoA reductase
inhibition to block the initiation of MYC-induced HCC growth
in vivo in the LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC transgenic mice treated with
PBS, AT, or AT with MV (Fig. 3A, left). Treatment with 100 mg/
kg AT versus PBS significantly delayed tumor onset and
increased survival (Fig. 3A; median survival increased from
80 to 147 days, P < 0.005). Importantly, MV treatment prevented AT from inhibiting tumorigenesis (Fig. 3A). Gross
pathology revealed that AT markedly reduced the size and
frequency of tumor nodules (Fig. 3B, left). H&E staining

for 48 hours were examined by immunofluorescence for Ki67, showing statin-induced reduction in proliferative cells (P < 0.0001). D, Huh7 cells were
transplanted intraperitoneally into SCID mice, and host animals were treated with PBS, AT, or AT with MV. A Kaplan–Meier curve shows a significant increase in
survival of animals treated with AT (PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.03; AT vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.04; PBS vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.8).

revealed histologically normal liver tissue in AT-treated mice,
suggesting a robust inhibition of disease onset (Fig. 3B, middle). AT-treated animals also exhibited evidence of inhibited
cell proliferation, as indicated by reduced Ki67 staining compared with PBS-treated mice (Fig. 3B, right; 8  3 positive cells
vs. 422  23 positive cells per field, P < 0.02). Hence, inhibition
of HMG-CoA reductase by AT is potent at inhibiting MYCinduced liver tumorigenesis.
Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses MYC
phosphorylation, stability, and transactivation
MYC activation has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (12). Thus, we considered that AT might exert its
antineoplastic effects by inhibiting MYC phosphorylation.
Indeed, AT, but not AT with MV, was found to induce a
dose-dependent downregulation of MYC phosphorylation in
vitro upon 24 hours treatment (Fig. 4A; 29% reduction at 0.5
mmol/L, 34% at 1.0 mmol/L, 79% at 2.5 mmol/L, 83% at 5.0
mmol/L, 94% at 10 mmol/L, and 97% at 25 mmol/L AT; P ¼
0.004) as well as in vivo (Fig. 4B; 93% reduction). Moreover, AT
blocked MYC phosphorylation in MYC-induced murine lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and lung cancer, as well as in human
breast cancer cell lines (data not shown). In turn, the dephosphorylation was associated with a reduction in MYC protein
levels in vitro (Fig. 4A; 17% reduction at 0.5 mmo/L, 40% at 1.0
mmol/L, 9% at 2.5 mmol/L, 41% at 5.0 mmol/L, 69% at 10 mmol/
L, and 91% at 25 mmol/L AT, P ¼ 0.002) and in vivo (Fig. 4B;
57% reduction, P ¼ 0.04). Importantly, the inhibition of MYC
phosphorylation by AT not only reduced MYC levels but also

2290

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

seemed to dramatically inhibit MYC transcriptional activation, as illustrated by the reduced mRNA expression of canonical target genes ODC and nucleolin, both in murine (Fig. 4C;
72% reduction for ODC, P ¼ 0.003; 76% reduction for nucleolin,
P ¼ 0.03) and in human HCC upon 24 hours of 10 mmol/L AT
treatment (Fig. 4D; 64% reduction for ODC, P ¼ 0.016; 59%
reduction for nucleolin, P ¼ 0.008; Supplementary Information,
Fig. S8B). Thus, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks
MYC phosphorylation, reduces MYC protein levels, and inhibits MYC transactivation.
Noninvasive molecular imaging to measure in vivo MYC
phosphorylation
To evaluate the effects of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase on MYC phosphorylation in situ in a living host, we
utilized a novel molecular imaging sensor system (31). The
sensor system consists of 2 parts: (i) a peptide corresponding
to the phosphoregulated domain of MYC fused to the Nterminal domain of FL and (ii) the C-terminal domain of FL
fused to a peptide fragment of GSK3b that recognizes
phospho-MYC (Fig. 5A). When coexpressed in an intact cell,
MYC phosphorylation can be detected via interaction
between the MYC and GSK3b peptides, thereby localizing
the N- and C-termini of FL in close proximity, conferring
luciferase activity. RL is cotransfected as a control for
transfection efficiency. The full-length FL was also transfected independently into these cells as a control for the
direct effect of AT on luciferase activity. We confirmed that
this imaging method could detect the dose-dependent

expression (P ¼ 0.016, P ¼ 0.008), respectively. Expression is normalized to ubiquitin and values are relative to DMSO control. Error bars, SD.

AT-mediated inhibition of MYC phosphorylation in vivo was
associated with a 44% and 56% downregulation in the expression of downstream target genes, E2F1 and Cdk4 (Supplementary Information, Fig. S8A), further showing the inhibition
of MYC activity. Hence, a novel imaging sensor was used to
show that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT inhibits
MYC phosphorylation in vivo.
MYC phosphomutants confer resistance to the
inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
To examine whether inhibition of MYC phosphorylation
mediates the anticancer effect of AT, we introduced phosphomutants of MYC into HCC tumor cell lines. First, recombinant adenovirus was used to express MYC that is mutated
with either an alanine substitution at either S62 or T58
(Ad-MYCS62A and Ad-MYCT58A) and hence cannot be regulated by phosphorylation at these sites (37). AT treatment at
10 mmol/L for 24 hours dramatically suppressed WT MYC but
failed to significantly inhibit protein levels of either S62A MYC
or T58A MYC (Fig. 6A; MYCS62A vs. MYCS62A þ AT, P ¼ 0.09;
MYCT58A vs. MYCT58AþAT, P ¼ 0.06). Thus, we concluded that

2292

phosphoregulation through either S62 or T58 is necessary for
AT to suppress MYC expression.
Using an antibody specific for phospho-S62 and -T58, we
show that AT inhibits phosphorylation in T58A MYC similar to
wild-type MYC (Fig. 6A, 62% reduction for MYCWT, P ¼ 0.01;
68% reduction for MYCT58A, P ¼ 0.008). These data show that
the reduction of phospho-MYC by AT seems to occur by
preventing S62 phosphorylation. However, the reduction of
total MYC protein cannot occur without T58 phosphorylation.
In addition, HCC cells expressing the S62A MYC mutant were
less sensitive whereas cells expressing T58A MYC were completely insensitive to the inhibition of proliferation upon AT
treatment (Fig. 6B, 26% reduction for WT, P < 0.001; 17%
reduction for S62, P < 0.0001; no reduction for T58, P ¼ 0.8).
Thus, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses MYC
activation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.
Next, we investigated whether the MYC phosphomutants
could suppress the ability of the inhibition of HMG-CoA
reductase to block HCC tumor growth in vivo. Syngeneic hosts
were transplanted with MYC-induced HCC cells that were then
injected with Ad-MYCWT, Ad-MYCS62A, or Ad-MYCT58A. Tumor

growth was monitored in response to AT, PBS, or AT with MV
treatment (Fig. 6C). The adenoviral delivery of the MYC phosphomutants was confirmed by coexpression of GFP (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9). To suppress the conditional
transgenic MYC expression, mice were treated with Dox,
thereby resulting in the effective knock-in of the Ad-MYCWT,
Ad-MYCS62A, or Ad-MYCT58A constructs into the HCC cells.
HCC growth upon injection of Ad-MYCWT showed 66% inhibition by 100 mg/kg AT but not by PBS or AT and MV treatment
(Fig. 6D, left, PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.01; AT vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.007).
However, HCC tumors that were injected with Ad-MYCS62A
exhibited only 44% inhibition of tumor growth upon treatment
with AT (Fig. 6D, middle, PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.02; AT vs. AT þ MV,
P ¼ 0.03). Tumors that were injected with Ad-MYCT58A showed
complete rescue from sensitivity to AT treatment (Fig. 6D,
right, PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.56; AT vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.03). Therefore,
MYC phosphorylation is necessary for AT to inhibit MYCinduced HCC tumor growth.
Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may block MYC
activity through Rac GTPase
We examined whether the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks MYC activation through Rac GTPases. Statins

block production of the isoprenoids farnesyl pyrophosphate
and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (23, 38, 39). FPP prenylates
the Ras, Rheb, and PTP4A3 family whereas GGPP prenylates
the Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 family of small GTPases (16). Previous
studies suggest that Ras and Rac/Rho families of GTPases may
contribute to the regulation of MYC phosphorylation (25).
Thus, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is likely to prevent
MYC phosphorylation through these GTPases
To explore the role of GTPases in mediating inhibition of
MYC phosphorylation, we conducted several experiments.
First, to control GTPase activity, we supplemented growth
media with either FPP or GGPP before 96 hours AT treatment
of MYC-induced murine HCC cells in vitro. Both MV and GGPP
restored HCC cell proliferation to levels similar to those of
DMSO controls (Fig. 7A; DMSO vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.07; DMSO
vs. GGPP, P ¼ 0.053), whereas FPP showed significantly less
reduction in AT-mediated growth inhibition (DMSO vs. FPP, P
< 0.002). Similarly, in Huh7 cells, GGPP was more potent than
FPP in abrogating the effect of 96 hours of 10 mmol/L AT on
proliferation (Fig. 7B; 16% reduction for DMSO vs. AT þ MV, P
< 0.01; 16% reduction for DMSO vs. GGPP, P < 0.01; 32%
reduction for DMSO vs. FPP, P < 0.001). In addition, GGPP was
more efficient in rescuing the transcription of multiple MYC

Figure 6. HCC transduced with S62A or T58A MYC phosphomutants show reduced sensitivity to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. A, murine HCC cells were
infected with Ad-MYCWT (WT), Ad-MYCS62A (S62A), or Ad-MYCT58A (T58A) adenovirus, and HA-tagged MYC was immunoprecipitated using an antibody to the
HA tag. Immunoblot analysis suggests that AT-dependent phosphoregulation of MYC is via S62. However, the inhibition of protein stability requires both S62
and T58 phosphoregulation. Cells were treated with 10 mmol/L AT for 24 hours. B, S62A partially and T58A completely abrogated AT inhibition of cell
proliferation (S62A: PBS vs. AT, P < 0.0001; T58A: PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.8). Error bars, SD. C, HCC cells isolated from transgenic animals were transplanted into
SCID mice, injected with Ad-MYCWT, Ad-MYCS62A, or Ad-MYCT58A once every week, and orally treated with PBS (n ¼ 6), AT (n ¼ 5), or AT with MV (n ¼ 5)
together with Dox. Tumor growth was measured 3 times per week. D, in vivo growth kinetics of HCC infected with Ad-MYCWT show that AT inhibits tumor
growth in vivo (left, PBS vs. AT, P ¼ 0.01; AT vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.007). Error bars, SD. Infection with Ad-MYCS62A partially rescues growth inhibition due to AT

target genes, including Cdk4 and E2F1, than FPP following 24
hours of 10 mmol/L AT treatment (Supplementary Information, Fig. S10, 40%–45% reduction for FPP, P < 0.001; 25%–60%
increase for GGPP, P < 0.03). MYC phosphorylation was
restored to levels similar to PBS-treated controls when media
containing 10 mmol/L AT was supplemented with GGPP but
not with FPP (Fig. 7C; 76% reduction for FPP, P ¼ 0.001; 21%
reduction for GGPP, P ¼ 0.02). Therefore, inhibition of HMGCoA reductase seems to inactivate MYC through the inhibition of the Rho/Rac pathway.
Finally, we examined the potential role of the Rac/Rho/
Cdc42 pathway as a mechanism by which AT suppresses MYC
activation. First, we investigated whether AT was influencing
the membrane localization of Rac1. Indeed, 24-hour treatment
with 10 mmol/L AT resulted in the delocalization of Rac1 from
the plasma membrane (Fig. 7D; 83% reduction for AT, P <
0.001). As a control, we showed that treatment with MV
blocked these effects, as did treatment with GGPP (Fig. 7D;
no change for PBS vs. AT þ MV, P ¼ 0.08; 37% increase for PBS
vs. GGPP, P < 0.03). Notably, AT had little effect on Ras
localization (data not shown). Second, using a Rac pull-down
assay, 24 hours of 10 mmol/L AT treatment was shown to
reduce Rac1 activity by 77% (Fig. 7E). Thus, the inhibition of

2294

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

HMG-CoA reductase by AT seems to suppress activation of
the Rac pathway, suggesting that AT in blocks MYC phosphorylation and activation via inhibition of Rac.

Discussion
Here, we show that MYC phosphorylation, activation, and
thereby tumorigenic potential are regulated by HMG-CoA
reductase. In particular, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
by statins suppresses MYC phosphorylation and activation.
The consequences of these effects on MYC include preventing
HCC initiation as well as inhibiting the in vivo growth of
established murine and human HCC tumors. Moreover, statins, by blocking HMG-CoA reductase, inhibit GTPase activity,
thereby resulting in MYC dephosphorylation and inactivation,
which is essential for their anticancer therapeutic effect
(Fig. 7F). Hence, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by
AT may be an effective strategy for the inhibition of MYC in
the treatment and prevention of HCC.
Importantly, we confirmed the antitumor effects of statins
that we observed both in vitro and in vivo were specific to
HMG-CoA reductase because they could be readily reversed by
cotreatment with MV. We note that the AT doses we used in

suggest a model in which
inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
by AT blocks prenylation and
activation of small GTPases,
specifically including Rac. ATmediated inhibition of Rac likely
results in reduction of phosphoS62 MYC. Dephosphorylation at
S62 in the context of phosphoT58 thereby results in the

MYC. As such, AT treatment

mice seem to be higher than generally used in humans.
However, it is well known that, because of differences in
the pharmacokinetics, murine doses have to be 50-fold higher
than in humans (35, 36). Moreover, we confirmed that the
antitumor dose of AT did not exhibit in vivo toxicity (Supplementary Information, Fig. S4) and hence is likely to be
achievable in humans.
The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was found to block
MYC phosphorylation. First, AT treatment blocks MYC phosphorylation in murine and human HCC cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Concomitant treatment with MV abrogates the ability
of AT to block MYC phosphorylation and activation and
mediate its suppressive effect on HCC growth, indicating that
the antineoplastic effect of AT is via the inhibition of HMG-

CoA reductase (Fig. 4). Second, a novel phosphorylation sensor
was used to show in situ in human HCC cells and in vivo in
living mice (Fig. 5). This phosphosensor may be a useful
approach to develop therapies that target MYC phosphorylation. Third, mutations in 2 MYC phosphorylation sites, specifically S62 and T58, blocks the ability of AT to inhibit tumor
growth in vivo. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase activity is
important to the regulation of MYC phosphorylation.
We infer that MYC phosphorylation is an essential component of the mechanism by which statins mediate their antineoplastic properties. The introduction of mutant MYC alleles
in HCC tumor cells reduced their sensitivity to statins in vitro
and in vivo. Specifically, the differential ability of S62A and
T58A MYC to block the effect of AT in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6)

suggests that AT-mediated reduction in phospho-S62 would
therefore result in MYC phosphorylated at only T58, which is
rapidly degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (12, 13).
Our results are consistent with a role of S62 and T58 phosphorylation in MYC stability and transcriptional activity and,
most important, their role in tumorigenesis (12). However, we
note that S62/T58 phosphorylation has not always been found
to regulate MYC stability (40). We conclude that the inhibition
of MYC phosphorylation may be important to the mechanism
by which the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins
exerts its antineoplastic properties.
Many reports suggest that statins have antineoplastic properties (25, 41–44). Many mechanisms have been proposed
including the inhibition of the ErbB2 pathway (45), the blocking of the interaction between the lymphocyte function–
associated antigen and intercellular cell adhesion molecule1 (46), the suppression of geranylgeranylation of the Rho
family proteins (47), and the prevention of the prenylation
of RhoA and downstream activation of focal adhesion kinase,
AKT, and b-catenin (23). Although we cannot preclude any of
these possibilities, our results are consistent with the notion
that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT in HCC cells
blocks MYC phosphorylation likely through the inhibition of
small GTPases in the Rac pathway (Fig. 7).
Our results are the first to suggest that HMG-CoA reductase
regulates MYC activation via Rac. We are currently investigating the signaling intermediates that may function between
Rac and MYC to mediate the antineoplastic effect of AT.
Previously, it has been suggested that Rac regulates MYC
(28). Rac1 can inhibit protein phosphatase PP2A (48), which
has been shown to dephosphorylate MYC at S62 (13). One
possible mechanism suggested by our work is that AT inhibition of Rac can result in activation of PP2A, which subsequently dephosphorylates MYC at S62 and induces the
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of T58-phosphorylated
MYC (Fig. 7F).
Our results illustrate that the inhibition of HMG-CoA
reductase by statins may be useful in the treatment and
prevention of human HCC. HCC is increasing in incidence,
has a generally dismal prognosis, and there are few treatment
options (49). Statins were developed to inhibit HMG-CoA
reductase in the liver to reduce cholesterol. Hence, they

may be aptly suited for treating cancers of the liver. Moreover,
statins are well tolerated in humans and may be useful in the
prevention of HCC in patients at high risk (49). Notably, some
clinical studies have suggested that that the statin pravastatin
may have clinical activity in patients with HCC (50, 51),
whereas other studies have not found clinical benefit (52).
A possible explanation for this possible discrepancy in the
benefit from statins is that clinical activity could depend upon
the activation status of MYC. Also, AT may be a more effective
statin for the treatment of HCC.
We conclude that MYC phosphorylation is a critical
mechanism by which the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
by statins mediates their antineoplastic effects. We have
shown that a novel molecular imaging sensor may be useful
for the identification through high-throughput methods of
new therapeutic agents that inhibit MYC phosphorylation and
activation. Importantly, statins may be effective agents to
inhibit MYC function as a treatment for HCC.
