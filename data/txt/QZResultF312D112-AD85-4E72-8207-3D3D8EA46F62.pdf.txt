Abstract

Introduction

Angiogenesis is a critical physiologic process that is
appropriated during tumorigenesis. Little is known about
how this process is specifically regulated in the brain. Brain
angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1) is a brain-predominant
seven-transmembrane protein that contains five antiangiogenic thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSR). We recently
showed that BAI1 is cleaved at a conserved proteolytic
cleavage site releasing a soluble, 120 kDa antiangiogenic
factor called vasculostatin (Vstat120). Vstat120 has been
shown to inhibit in vitro angiogenesis and suppress
subcutaneous tumor growth. Here, we examine its effect
on the intracranial growth of malignant gliomas and further
study its antitumor mechanism. First, we show that
expression of Vstat120 strongly suppresses the intracranial
growth of malignant gliomas, even in the presence of the
strong proangiogenic stimulus mediated by the oncoprotein
epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII). This
tumor-suppressive effect is accompanied by a decrease in
tumor vascular density, suggesting a potent antiangiogenic
effect in the brain. Second, and consistent with this
interpretation, we find that treatment with Vstat120 reduces
the migration of cultured microvascular endothelial cells
in vitro and inhibits corneal angiogenesis in vivo. Third, we
show that these antivascular effects critically depend on the
presence of the cell surface receptor CD36 on endothelial
cells in vitro and in vivo, supporting the role of Vstat120
TSRs in mediating these effects. These results advance the
understanding of brain-specific angiogenic regulation, and
suggest that Vstat120 has therapeutic potential in the
treatment of brain tumors and other intracerebral vasculopathies. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):1212–20]

The process of angiogenesis is tightly regulated in normal adult
tissues by maintaining a delicate balance between proangiogenic
and antiangiogenic factors. In neoplasia, this balance is tilted in
favor of new blood vessel development, thereby increasing its
vascular supply and promoting growth and metastasis (1, 2). The
production of proangiogenic molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin 8 is increased, and the expression
of antiangiogenic factors, such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is
reduced (3, 4). Arresting angiogenesis in combination with other
agents is currently being exploited as an effective new therapeutic
modality for cancer (5, 6). Little is known about how physiologic
angiogenesis is regulated in the brain and how it becomes co-opted
during brain tumor development.
Gliomas are the most common primary tumor of the central
nervous system. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive form of
malignant astrocytoma (WHO grade 4) is characterized pathologically by a highly abnormal vasculature (7). During astrocytoma
progression from low to high grade, increased vessel density
coincides with malignant progression as well as an accumulation of
genetic defects. The two genetic alterations that occur at the
transition to WHO grade 4 GBM are the loss of the PTEN tumor
suppressor gene and the amplification of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) proto-oncogene (8, 9). Apart from gene
amplification and receptor overexpression, the EGFR gene
is also frequently mutated in GBM. The most common of these
mutations results in a truncated ligand-independent EGFRvIII with
constitutive activity (10, 11). Importantly, both these events are
known to increase the angiogenic phenotype of glioma cells.
Brain angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1) is a member of the
‘‘adhesion’’ subfamily of G protein–coupled receptors, thought to
be involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (12, 13). Its
expression is reduced in malignant gliomas, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, pancreatic and gastric cancers, but present in the corresponding normal tissue with, by far, the most abundant expression in
the brain (14–16). Re-expression of BAI1 in tumor cells which have
lost its expression has been shown to result in slow-growing tumors
with reduced vessel density, suggesting an antiangiogenic function
(17, 18). We recently described vasculostatin, a naturally occurring
120 kDa fragment (Vstat120) of BAI1 (19). We have shown that
Vstat120 is released from BAI1 by proteolytic cleavage at a
consensus G protein coupled receptor proteolytic cleavage site
located close to the junction with the plasma membrane. Vstat120
contains an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) integrin recognition
motif and five thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSR); both of these

Vasculostatin Inhibits Intracranial Glioblastoma Growth

domains are known to mediate antiangiogenic functions in
thrombospondins (20–22). However, it is not clear if the five TSRs
contribute to the angiostatic effect of Vstat120.
We have shown that Vstat120 can suppress the growth of glial
tumors in a subcutaneous mouse xenograft model (19). However,
tumor growth as well as its response to targeted treatments is
affected by its location and microenvironment (23). Despite its
primarily brain-specific expression, the effect of Vstat120 on the
growth of intracerebral tumors has not been investigated (13, 24).
Here, we examined the effects of Vstat120 on the growth of gliomas
of varying genetic makeup, degree of malignancy, and proangiogenic potential in their orthotopic environment. We have further
investigated the antiangiogenic effects of Vstat120 in a number of
in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis models and established that
Vstat120 binding to CD36, an endothelial cell receptor for the TSR
domains of TSP-1 and TSP-2, is essential for its angiostatic effect.
These results indicate the functional significance of the five TSRs in
Vstat120.

Materials and Methods
Culture of cell lines and transfection conditions. The human
glioblastoma LN229 and embryonic 293 cell lines have been previously
described (25). Two U87MG glioblastoma cell lines maintained independently in two laboratories were used. U87MG-D cells were provided to us by
Dr. D. Durden’s laboratory (Emory University, Atlanta, GA) and were used to
derive the U87MGD-Vstat120 (clones U14 and U18) by stable transfection
with an expression vector for Vstat120 (pcDNA3.1mychisVstat120). U87MGF were obtained from Dr. F. Furnari’s laboratory (Ludwig Institute for
Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA) and were used to generate U87DEGFR cells
which stably express the EGFRvIII mutant form of EGFR (26). U87MGD
display more aggressive in vivo growth than U87MGF. The U87MGFDEGFR-Vstat120 (clones D19 and D22) cells were prepared by stably
transfecting U87MGF-DEGFR parental cells with pcDNA3.1mychisVstat120.
The LN229Vstat120 (clone 13) and LN229TSP1 (clone C9) cells were
prepared by stably transfecting LN229 cells with expression vectors for
Vstat120 (pcDNA3.1mychisVstat120) and TSP-1 (pcDNATS1). Conditioned
media (CM) were prepared from 80% confluent cultures grown for 48 to
96 h in serum-free medium. 293 cells were transiently transfected with the
indicated plasmids using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy
Systems) as recommended. Serum-free CM was collected from cells after
48 h and precipitated using 50% TCA as described (19). The primary
cultures of endothelial cells [human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) or human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC)]
were prepared by the Emory University Dermatology Core Facility and
grown as described (19). Primary human brain (cortex; 24 year old)
microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from Cell Systems Corp.
(ACBRI376) and grown as recommended.
Preparation of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins. Two different glutathione-S-transferase (GST)/CD36 constructs
containing the CLESH domain (spanning amino acids 5–143 and 67–157)
were prepared as previously described (27). The GST fusion proteins were
expressed in Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) bacteria, induced at log phase with
3 mmol/L of IPTG for 3 h at 37jC. The bacteria were centrifuged and
resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer [PBS, One Complete mini EDTA-free
protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche), and 1 mg/mL lysozyme] and
frozen overnight at 20jC. The bacterial solutions were thawed in warm
water and pulse-sonicated (3  15 s). Lysates were sedimented at 31,000  g
for 30 min, followed by successive washes with buffer 1 (25 mL of PBS, 0.1%
Triton X-100), and buffer 2 (50 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 300 mmol/L NaCl; pH 8.0),
and dissolved in 5 mL of denaturing buffer (8 mol/L urea, 50 mmol/L TrisHCl; pH 8.0). After 30 min of centrifugation at 30,000  g to remove
insoluble debris, the proteins were refolded by drop-wise addition into
20 mL of refolding buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L
EDTA; pH 9.0), then dialyzed overnight in 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0).

Recombinant proteins bound to glutathione sepharose 4B resin (GE
Healthcare) were either purified by elution with 50 mmol/L of Tris-HCl,
10 mmol/L of glutathione or used to pull down Vstat120 or TSP-1.
GST pull-down assay. The GST-CD36-CLESH fusion protein solutions
(15 mL) were preabsorbed with 100 AL of glutathione sepharose 4B beads
(GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4jC. After two washes with cold PBS, 15 mL of
undiluted CM (collected after 96 h in serum-free medium) from stably
transfected or parental control cells was added to 100 AL of beads at 4jC
overnight with constant rotation. The beads were centrifuged (100  g for
1 min) and washed twice with 5 mL of PBS. Bound proteins were eluted and
solubilized in 50 AL of SDS-PAGE denaturing sample buffer.
Western blot analysis. Immunoblots were performed on cell lysates
(lysed in 8 mol/L urea, 4% SDS, in 10 mmol/L Tris; pH 7.4), from the
indicated cells or tissue. Protein lysates (40 Ag) were resolved on 7.5% SDSPAGE and Western blots probed with rabbit anti–NH2-terminal BAI1 (14),
or goat anti-actin (diluted 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-GST
antibodies (MAB3317; Chemicon International), followed by goat anti-rabbit
(DAKO, Co.) or swine anti-goat (diluted 1:1,000; Roche Molecular
Biochemicals) secondary antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).
Proliferation assays. Proliferation rates of the different Vstat120transfected and empty vector clones was assessed by the crystal violet
assay (28). Equal cell numbers (4,000) of the indicated clones were plated in
96-well plates (n = 8). The cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, and then
stained with 0.5% crystal violet. After washing, the crystals were dissolved in
Sorenson’s buffer (0.025 mol/L sodium citrate, 0.025 mol/L citric acid in 50%
ethanol) and absorbance was read at A590 nm.
Tumorigenicity studies. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts were performed as previously described on mice marked by tattoos for identification
(19, 29). To establish orthotopic brain tumor xenografts, 106 glioma cells
were stereotactically injected into the brains of athymic nu/nu rats as
described (30). Animals were anesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine
(80 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) mixture and then secured to a stereotactic
frame. Body temperature was maintained by a heating pad. A saggital
midline incision was made from 5 mm anterior to the bregma to the
occiput. A 2-mm drill was then used to make a burr hole 3 mm to the right
and 1 mm anterior of the bregma of the skull. A 23-gauge Hamilton syringe
was advanced 4.5 mm deep over a period of 1 min, and then retracted
0.5 mm prior to injecting 5 AL of tumor cell suspension over a period of
2 min. Postinjection, the needle was slowly retracted over a period of 1 min,
the burr hole filled with sterile bone wax, the skull washed with sterile water
to destroy, by osmosis, any cells leaked into the subgaleal space and the scalp
was closed with 3–0 running vicryl stitches. Survival curves were compared
using the log-rank test using SPSS statistical software (version 14.0; SPSS,
Inc.) and P < 0.05 values were considered significant. Studies followed Emory
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.
Magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans were carried out on a 3T MRI scanner (Philips Intera) using a small
volume coil (5 cm diameter). Anesthetized animals were placed in the coil
and the head secured using foam padding to minimize possible motions.
MRI contrast agent, gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (GdDTPA), was administrated i.v. at a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg to obtain signal
enhancement in the tumor. Multi-slice T1-weighted spin echo images were
obtained in the coronal orientation using a repetition time of 400 ms, echo
time of 14 ms, and imaging matrix of 128  128 with the field of view of
50  50 mm2. To match the histologic analysis, a slice thickness of 2 mm
was used without slice gap. The number of signal averages was three for
most of the scans. T1-weighted spin echo imaging was done before and
after administration of the contrast agent for each animal using the same
imaging variables.
Histologic analysis. Tumors were fixed in 10% buffered formalin
followed by paraffin embedding and immunohistochemistry of tissue
sections (8 Am) to visualize the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels
perfusing the tumor. The number of vascular structures/mm2 in the tumor
xenografts was quantified by counting three different 10 microscopic fields
for each of three rats/group. The three fields were averaged in each tumor
and the averages for each animal used to give the final count F SE.

In vitro transwell and scratch-wound endothelial cell migration
assays. CM from HEK 293 cells transfected with Vstat120 (pcDNAecBAI1myc-his) or control vector (pcDNA3.1-LacZ, a h-galactosidase expression
vector) was collected and concentrated 40 using a YM-10 filter (Amicon).
For the modified Boyden chamber migration assays, indicated cells were
plated in transwell chambers (Becton Dickinson Labware) with a pore size
of 8 Am (50,000 cells/chamber). The cells were placed on 1% serumcontaining medium overnight and were then pretreated with CM (diluted at
1 in endothelial medium) for 30 min. Medium containing 10% serum was
used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber, whereas CM remained in
the upper chamber. After 8 h, migrated cells were quantified by counting
three 10 microscopic views/filter and the data presented as the mean of
three filters. Random migration in response to medium alone was
subtracted from the values. For scratch-wound migration assays, confluent
HDMECs were incubated in 1% medium overnight in 12-well plates, then
wounded with a 10 AL pipette tip and detached cells were removed by PBS
washes. The cells were treated with CM at a final concentration of 1 for
30 min with or without an anti-CD36 function–blocking antibody at 10 Ag/mL
(FA6-152; Cell Sciences), followed by incubation in 10% serum to induce cell
migration. Initial wound width was measured, and the cells were allowed to
migrate for 8 h, and were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, stained with
0.5% crystal violet, and photographed. The experiment was repeated
independently twice and significance determined by Student’s t test.
In vivo cornea angiogenesis assays. Pellets were generated as
previously described (31) by mixing sterile solutions of basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF; Research Diagnostics, Inc.) at a final concentration of
25 ng/pellet, concentrated CM (50 ng total protein from CM per pellet), and
sucralfate (Teva Pharmaceuticals), and then spreading the solution onto a
nylon mesh 3-300/50 with an approximate pore size of 0.4  0.4 mm
(Tetko). The mixture was sealed on both sides with hydron. In this case,
7.5 AL concentrated medium/100 pellets were added. Individual pellets were
detached by peeling the nylon mesh, and pellets of similar size were chosen
under a dissecting microscope for implantation. Mice were anesthetized as
above and the eyes were topically anesthetized with 0.5% proparacaine and
2% alocril and the globes proptosed with a forceps. Pellets were implanted
f1 mm from the limbus. Briefly, under a dissecting microscope, a central,

intrastromal linear keratotomy (f0.5 mm in length) was performed with a
surgical blade (Bard-Parker; Becton Dickinson), and using the arm of a fine
forceps, a micropocket was created toward the limbus. Pellets were placed
at the base of the pocket. Erythromycin antibiotic ointment was applied to
the operated eye, both to prevent infection and to decrease irritation. Mice
received Buprenex (2.5 mg/kg s.c.) after surgery to control for pain. Five
days postimplantation, mice were anesthetized and 50 AL of a 2.5 mg/mL
solution of sterile FITC-dextran (molecular weight approximately M r 70,000;
Sigma) was injected into the retro-orbital sinus. The eyes were proptosed as
before, and digital images of the cornea were captured under a fluorescent
dissecting microscope (Leica) and transferred to Adobe Photoshop for
measurements. The maximum vessel length and the neovascularization
zone (in clock hours), were used to calculate the area of neovascularization,
using the formula: area (mm2) = 0.2  p  VL (mm)  CH; VL, vessel
length; CH, clock hours; where one clock hour equals 30 degrees of an arc.

Results
Expression of Vstat120 suppresses the growth of intracranial
gliomas. Because BAI1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, we
investigated the role of its proteolytic cleavage product, Vstat120,
on the orthotopic growth of brain tumors. We first generated two
clones (U14 and U18) expressing and secreting Vstat120 in human
U87MGD malignant glioma cells following stable transfection
with an expression vector (Fig. 1A). The in vitro proliferation rates
of these cells were not altered by Vstat120 expression (Fig. 1B). We
confirmed that CM from Vstat120-expressing cells significantly
inhibited the migration of HDMEC (Fig. 1C), as we previously
described (19). To assess the therapeutic potential of Vstat120
expression on tumor growth in the brain, we implanted U14, U18,
and parental U87MGD cells (106/animal) stereotactically into the
brains of athymic nude rats (n = 6 rats/group). Both Vstat120expressing clones extended the median survival of animals
compared with the control parental U87MGD cells (P < 0.05).

clones stably transfected with Vstat120 cDNA

the whole cell extract (WCE ) and conditioned
medium (CM ) of the stably transfected clones.
B, the in vitro proliferation rates of U87MG cells and
clones U14 and U18 were determined by the crystal
violet assay. Expression of Vstat120 did not alter
the proliferation rate of the clones versus
U87MG cells. C, CM from control U87MGD or
Vstat120-expressing U14 cells were tested for their
ability to inhibit the migration of HDMECs in a
transwell migration assay. The number of cells that
migrated to the bottom of the chamber after 8 h was
quantified as described in Materials and Methods.
Random migration in response to medium alone
was subtracted from the values. Expression levels
of Vstat120 and TSP-1 in the CM were assessed by
Western blot. D, intracranial tumorigenicity assay
for U87MG and Vstat120-expressing clones,
U14 and U18. Cells (1  106) were implanted
stereotactically in the brain of athymic nude rats.
Survival curves of rats implanted with cells
expressing Vstat120 showed a significant
improvement in their survival compared with the
control parental U87MG cells (P < 0.05).

Vasculostatin Inhibits Intracranial Glioblastoma Growth

A, characterization of U87DEGFR and Vstat120-expressing
clones D19 and D22. Top, Western blot analysis of whole
cell extract (WCE ) and conditioned medium (CM) from
U87DEGFR cells (U87D) and derived clones D19 and D22,
which stably express Vstat120. Bottom, in vitro proliferation

clones D19 and D22, as measured using the crystal violet
assay. Expression of Vstat120 does not alter the in vitro
proliferation rates of these cells. B, subcutaneous growth of
U87DEGFR and Vstat120-expressing clones D19 and D22
in nu/nu mice. U87DEGFR and derived clones stably
expressing Vstat120 (D19 and D22) were injected s.c. into
mice (n = 6) and the tumor volume for the indicated clones
was plotted as a function of time. Note the strongly
decreased tumor growth of clones expressing Vstat120.
C, relative growth of U87MGF, U87DEGFR, and
Vstat120-expressing clones in rat brains. Top, MRI scans of
individual rat brains 14 d after intracranial implantation of 106
tumor cells. The presence of a glioma is detected through
the bright areas (white arrows ) of contrast enhancement
from the MRI contrast agent (Gd-DTPA). Note the small
tumor in U87MGF cells, the large tumor in U87DEGFR cells,
and the barely detectable minimal tumors in clones D22 and
D19. Bottom, corresponding histopathologic brain sections
stained with H&E. Tumor growth is visible as a darkly stained
area (black arrow ). D, survival curves of rats implanted with
U87MGF, U87DEGFR, and Vstat120-expressing clones,
D19 and D22. Cells (1  106) were implanted stereotactically
in the brain of athymic nu/nu rats. Rats implanted with
U87DEGFR cells had the shortest survival time due to the
very angiogenic and aggressive nature of these tumors.
Vstat120-expressing clones D19 and D22 showed a
significant improvement in their survival compared with the
parental U87DEGFR and control U87MGF cells (P < 0.05).

U87MGD glioma cells was 18 days. In contrast, the median survival
of the animals injected with Vstat120-expressing clones U14 and
U18 was 28 (range, 24–34) and 41 (range, 34–49) days, respectively
(Fig. 1D).
Expression of Vstat120 can suppress intracranial tumor
growth even when a proangiogenic stimulus is present.
Parental U87MGF malignant glioma cells are proangiogenic due
to the loss of PTEN (32). However, they lack expression of EGFRvIII,
the genetic hallmark of a large subset of GBM (10, 11). This
mutation confers an aggressive and highly angiogenic phenotype
(26, 33). To test if Vstat120 could suppress the growth of such
highly aggressive gliomas, we used U87MGF glioma cells that stably
express the EGFRvIII mutant receptor (U87DEGFR; ref. 26). We
then stably transfected U87DEGFR with a Vstat120 expression

vector and selected two clones (D19 and D22) for further analyses.
These cells expressed Vstat120 in both the whole cell extract and
conditioned medium, and did not show any alterations in their
in vitro proliferation rates (Fig. 2A). To assess the therapeutic
potential of Vstat120 expression on this highly aggressive glioma,
we used both the mouse subcutaneous and rat orthotopic
xenograft models.
Athymic nu/nu mice (n = 6/group) injected with U87DEGFR cells
formed large subcutaneous tumors, and mice had to be sacrificed
by day 25. In contrast, mice injected with Vstat120-expressing cells
showed significant tumor growth suppression (Fig. 2B). Western
blot analysis of the excised tumors revealed expression of Vstat120
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S1). To examine whether Vstat120
would also antagonize tumor formation in their orthotopic

microenvironment, we implanted 106 cells of U87MGF, U87DEGFR,
D19, and D22 cells stereotactically in the brain of athymic nu/nu
rats. Initially, the effect of Vstat120 on tumor growth was measured
noninvasively by MRI on day 14 to determine tumor growth (n = 3/
group). Immediately thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and
corresponding sections of the brains were analyzed by H&E
staining. Both MRI and pathology results evidenced smaller tumors
in gliomas derived from cells expressing Vstat120 (Fig. 2C). Next,
we examined the effect of Vstat120 expression on the survival of
animals with intracranial tumors (n = 6 animals/group). Consistent
with previous reports (26), the added expression of EGFRvIII to
U87MGF cells significantly reduced the median survival of rats
from 31 to 21 days (P < 0.002). In contrast, the median survival of
rats implanted with intracranial D19 and D22 cells was 57 days
(34–114 days) and 41 days (37–45 days), respectively (Fig. 2D).
These results showed that expression of Vstat120 significantly
slowed tumor growth and increased survival (P < 0.001 between
animals implanted with either of the Vstat120-expressing clones, D19
and D22, and the control U87DEGFR cells). Interestingly, among
rats injected with Vstat120-expressing D19 cells, there were three
long-term survivors who lived for more than 60 days after tumor cell
implantation. Two of these three rats eventually died of tumor burden
on days 85 and 114, and the third animal was sacrificed on day 168
and found to be tumor-free. Combined, the above results show that
Vstat120 has potent inhibitory effects on glioma growth in vivo, both
in the subcutaneous and in the brain microenvironments.
Measurement of vascular density in intracranial gliomas. To
determine whether the reduced ability of Vstat120-expressing cells
to grow in vivo but not in vitro was due to impairment in recruiting
the vascular supply needed for solid tumor growth, we examined
the vascular phenotype of intracranial tumors derived from
U87DEGFR and Vstat120 clones. Immunohistochemistry for von
Willebrand factor, a vascular marker, revealed a significant
reduction in the density of vascular structures in Vstat120expressing tumors (Fig. 3A). Vessel density in brain tumor sections
derived from Vstat120-expressing cells (D19 and D22) showed an
average of 18 (F 2.0) vessels/mm2, whereas control U87DEGFR
tumors had 32 (F1.5) vessels/mm2 (P < 0.005; Fig. 3B). These data
show that Vstat120 can reduce the vascular density of a very
aggressive form of human brain tumor in its orthotopic
microenvironment in a rat model.
Vstat120-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell migration
in vitro requires CD36. The above data, combined with our
previous demonstration that Vstat120 inhibits endothelial cell
migration in vitro (19), suggests that Vstat120 can suppress
angiogenesis by antagonizing the neovascularization response of
endothelial cells. Vstat120 contains five TSRs and an integrinbinding RGD motif, both of which are known to impart an
antiangiogenic function to thrombospondins (13, 20, 21, 34). The
antiangiogenic effects of TSRs found in TSP-1 are mediated
primarily upon binding to CD36 on endothelial cells (35). Whether
TSRs in nonthrombospondin proteins can also regulate angiogenesis through CD36 is currently unknown. Therefore, we examined
if interactions with CD36 may play a mechanistic role in Vstat120’s
angiostatic function, likely through its five TSRs (35). CD36 is
known to be strongly expressed on HDMECs, whereas very little to
none is found on HUVECs (36). We confirmed the differential
expression of CD36 in HDMEC and HUVEC (Fig. 4A). To evaluate
the role played by CD36 on Vstat120 antiangiogenic effect, we
compared the susceptibility of CD36-expressing HDMEC and
nonexpressing HUVECs to the inhibitory effects of Vstat120 in a

migration of CD36-expressing HDMECs, but had no effect on
CD36-nonexpressing HUVEC cell migration, potentially implicating
CD36 in Vstat120 effects (Fig. 4B, right). The effect of Vstat120 on
HDMEC migration was further tested in a scratch-wound
migration assay (Fig. 4C). Confluent HDMECs were wounded and
the extent of wound closure was measured after 8 hours, at which
time, the cells were fixed and stained. The leading edge of cells

migrated a greater distance in the control cells compared with the
Vstat120-treated cells. Quantification of the distance migrated,
percentage of wound closure, and migration speed of cells showed
that Vstat120 significantly reduced the migration of HDMECs.
Next, we determined whether an anti-CD36 function–blocking
antibody could abrogate the inhibitory function of Vstat120 on
HDMECs in a scratch-wound migration assay (Fig. 4C, lower panel).
Confluent HDMECs were left untreated or were treated with antiCD36 antibody for 30 minutes prior to treatment with control or
Vstat120-containing CM. Quantification of these results showed
that preincubation of HDMECs with neutralizing anti-CD36
antibody completely abrogated the antimigratory effect of Vstat120.
Altogether, these findings suggest that Vstat120 can antagonize the
migration of endothelial cells in a CD36-dependent fashion.
To further examine whether these findings were consistent with
the antitumor and antivascular effects of Vstat120 in brain, it was
critical to show CD36 expression in brain tumor vasculature and that
Vstat120-secreting glioma cells could inhibit the function of brainderived endothelial cells in vitro. Immunofluorescent staining of

normal brain (human and mouse) and human glioblastoma
specimens for factor VIII and CD36 confirmed the presence of
CD36 in brain and glioma vasculature (Supplementary Fig. S2,
available online). Transwell assays showed that the migration of
primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) was
blocked with CM from Vstat120-expressing U14 glioma cells
in vitro (Fig. 4D).
Vstat120 can bind to the CLESH domain of CD36. The
antiangiogenic effects of TSP-1 and TSP-2 are mediated by their
binding to CD36 on endothelial cells. This interaction is dependent
on the binding of the TSR domain(s) to a conserved region within
CD36 called the CLESH domain (reviewed in ref. 37). Consequently,
we tested the ability of Vstat120 to bind to recombinant CD36
CLESH domain peptides. GST-tagged peptides spanning amino
acids 5 to 143 and 67 to 157 of CD36 were expressed and purified in
E. coli (Fig. 5A and B). The indicated GST fusion proteins were
tested for their ability to bind to TSP-1. Briefly, the indicated
recombinant peptide bound to glutathione-sepharose beads was
used to pull down TSP-1 from CM of LN229 cells constitutively

expressing TSP-1 (clone C9). Western blot of the pulled down
proteins confirmed their ability to bind to TSRs. (Fig. 5C, left). The
indicated GST fusion proteins were then tested for their ability to
bind to Vstat120 in a similar pull-down assay using Vstat120 from
CM of LN229 glioma cells constitutively expressing Vstat120. Figure
5C shows that the GST-tagged recombinant CD36 CLESH proteins,
but not GST alone, pulled down Vstat120. These results show the
ability of Vstat120 to bind to the CLESH domain of CD36.
Vstat120 inhibits corneal angiogenesis in a CD36-dependent
fashion. To examine whether Vstat120 would also inhibit neovascularization in vivo, we performed corneal angiogenesis assays
in mice. To further assess the involvement of CD36 in this process,
we compared the effects of Vstat120 on bFGF-induced corneal
angiogenesis in wild-type and CD36 knockout mice (38). Micropellets containing human bFGF and CM of 293 cells transfected
with Vstat120 cDNA or a control vector were implanted into the
mice cornea. The results show that Vstat120 can reduce the extent
of bFGF-induced corneal neovascularization in wild-type mice
(Fig. 6A). This inhibitory effect was completely abolished in CD36
knockout mice. The mean area of neovascularization in corneas
with pellets containing Vstat120 CM was significantly decreased
(40%, P < 0.05) as compared with those containing control CM
(Fig. 6B). Altogether, these results show that CD36 expression is
required for Vstat120 antiangiogenic effects on endothelial cells
both in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
We have previously shown that the cleaved and secreted 120 kDa
Vstat120 fragment of BAI1 functions as an autonomous paracrine
antiangiogenic factor (19). We now show that Vstat120 expression
can prolong the life of rats bearing intracranial gliomas. This

tumor-suppressive effect of Vstat120 in the brain was sustained
even when glioma cells were engineered to overexpress EGFRvIII,
an oncogenic mutant EGFR resulting in highly angiogenic and
aggressive tumors (26). These results highlight the potential
significance of harnessing Vstat120 as a therapeutic agent for the
treatment of the most malignant form of glioma in humans.
Insights into the mechanism of action of bioactive molecules is
critical for their development as therapeutics. The mechanism of
Vstat120 angiostatic effect is poorly understood (19, 39). The
extracellular domain of BAI1 includes five TSRs and an RGD
integrin-interaction motif (13). TSRs were originally discovered in
TSP-1, a naturally occurring potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. TSRs
are approximately 60 amino acids in length and more than 180
have been identified in over 70 TSR-containing human proteins
(40). The latter include proteins of diverse functions such as the
ADAMTS family of metalloproteases, complement factors C6, C7,
C8, and C9, the F-, R- and M-spondins, semaphorins, Unc5,
heparin-binding growth-associated molecule, and BAI-1, BAI-2, and
BAI-3. The degree of sequence identity between TSR within a single
protein is as diverse as that found in other TSR-containing
proteins, suggesting a complex evolutionary origin (41). This high
level of sequence heterogeneity between TSRs within and across
diverse proteins suggests that they may carry out multiple
functions. Based on current knowledge, homology in function
cannot be inferred, but rather needs to be tested for each individual
TSR. This highlights the importance of defining the function
of individual TSRs in different proteins so that structural
determinants can be identified in the future that will help
accelerate the design of structure-function prediction algorithms.
Although at least five TSR-containing proteins, TSP-1 and TSP-2,
ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-8, and BAI1/Vstat120 are potent
inhibitors of angiogenesis, thus far, only the TSRs of TSPs have

expression by Western blot. Both the

been convincingly linked to the antiangiogenic activity of that
protein family. Recent structural data have suggested that TSRcontaining proteins could be subdivided into two categories based
on the number and orientation of the disulfide bonds between their
three antiparallel strands and the overall positive charge of their
outer shell surface (42). The first category encompasses TSP-1 and
TSP-2, BAI1 to BAI3, and the ADAMTS proteins, whereas the
second category comprises the F-spondin and M-spondins, and
some complement proteins. The fact that all known antiangiogenic
TSR-containing proteins belong to the first category suggests
that antiangiogenic activity might directly derive from functional
homology of their TSRs. Furthermore, the likely mechanistic basis
of this distinction is the capacity to bind the antiangiogenic
endothelial cell receptor CD36. The studies reported here support
this hypothesis, as do recent studies7 demonstrating that
recombinant TSRs from a nonangiogenic protein, F-spondin, did
not bind CD36 CLESH domains.

Purified recombinant peptides expressing three of the five TSRs
in BAI1 were initially shown to inhibit angiogenesis in a rabbit
corneal angiogenesis assay (13). It has remained unclear, however,
whether they would serve the same function in the full-length
human BAI1 protein, in which native conformation, posttranslational modifications, and physiologic concentrations might define
activity. Recent data also showed that the TSRs of BAI1 are
responsible for the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells
by macrophages through the ELMO/Dock180/Rac signaling axis
(43). Further complicating the issue is a recent study suggesting
that the angiostatic effect of BAI1 was mediated by its ability to
block avh5 integrin receptors on endothelial cells (39). Because the
antiangiogenic effects of TSP-1 and TSP-2 TSRs are mediated by
their binding to CD36 and subsequent activation of a signaling
cascade that triggers apoptosis (35, 38, 44), we hypothesized that
the antiangiogenic effect of Vstat120 might be equally dependent
on the engagement of endothelial cell CD36 by Vstat120 TSRs.
Brain-derived and skin-derived endothelial cells express CD36 (44),
whereas umbilical cord–derived HUVEC show very little expression
(36). We first showed that Vstat120 inhibited bFGF-induced
migration of CD36-expressing HDMEC and HBMECs, but not that
of HUVECs. Second, we showed that the ability of Vstat120 to
inhibit HDMEC migration was suppressed in the presence of
function-blocking CD36 antibodies. Third, we showed that Vstat120
inhibited corneal neovascularization in wild-type but not CD36
knockout mice. Combined, our results indicate that the inhibitory
effect of Vstat120 is dependent on CD36 expression on endothelial
cells both in vitro and in vivo. The antiangiogenic effect mediated
by TSP-1 binding to CD36 is followed by sequential activation of
p59fyn , caspase-3–like proteases and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinases, and leads to endothelial cell apoptosis (35, 38, 44). The
precise signaling cascade activated by Vstat120 interaction with
CD36 in endothelial cells remains to be determined, but we predict
that it will likely overlap with that elicited by TSP-1 given their
homology in function. If this turns out to indeed be the case, the
fine structural mapping of the domains involved in TSR-CD36
interactions should facilitate the identification of critical structural
requirements for binding and perhaps the development of
computer algorithms to predict which TSR-containing proteins
will be antiangiogenic.
The CLESH domain of CD36 (amino acids 93–120) is a critical
determinant of the binding of TSP-1 and TSP-2 TSR to endothelial
cells. This domain is predicted to form part of a negatively charged
loop within CD36 believed to interact with the positively charged
front groove of TSRs of type 1 (45, 46). We showed the ability of
Vstat120 to bind to purified peptides containing the CLESH
domain of CD36, indicating a specific interaction between Vstat120
and CD36, and functional homology with TSP-1 and TSP-2 TSR.
These studies provide the first direct evidence that non-TSP TSRs
of type 1 can bind CLESH domains.
These results show the significance of the endothelial receptor
CD36 in mediating Vstat120’s angiostatic effect. This is the first study
showing that Vstat120 is critically dependent on the presence of
CD36 to suppress the process of neovascularization both in vitro and
in vivo. It remains to be determined whether Vstat120’s five TSRs are
sufficient, either singly or in combination, to mediate the antiangiogenic effects of Vstat120 or whether the proximal RGD
sequence is required for full activity. Synthetic peptides derived
from TSP-1–derived TSRs have shown efficacy in preclinical models
of cancer. ABT510 is one such peptide that has shown potent
antitumorigenic effect in preclinical models and is currently being

investigated in clinical trials for safety and efficacy (44, 47, 48). Future
studies are warranted to refine the minimal regions of Vstat120
necessary and sufficient to mediate its antitumorigenic functions.
This can then be exploited for the development of novel anticancer
therapeutic agents that can function alone or in combination with
other agents such as oncolytic viruses (49, 50). Such novel agents
could be Vstat peptides or peptidomimetics, or alternatively, agents
that could stimulate the cleavage of endogenous BAI1 in normal
brain tissue to release therapeutic doses of vasculostatin.
