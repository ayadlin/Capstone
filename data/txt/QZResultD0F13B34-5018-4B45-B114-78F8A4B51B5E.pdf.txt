Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of deaths from cancer. E2F1 is a transcription factor involved in cell
proliferation, apoptosis. and metastasis through an intricate regulatory network, which includes other transcription factors like p73 and cancer-related microRNAs like miR-205. To investigate the emergence of drug
resistance, we developed a methodology that integrates experimental data with a network biology and kinetic
modeling. Using a regulatory map developed to summarize knowledge on E2F1 and its interplay with p73/
DNp73 and miR-205 in cancer drug responses, we derived a kinetic model that represents the network response to
certain genotoxic and cytostatic anticancer drugs. By perturbing the model parameters, we simulated heterogeneous cell conﬁgurations referred to as in silico cell lines. These were used to detect genetic signatures
characteristic for single or double drug resistance. We identiﬁed a signature composed of high E2F1 and low
miR-205 expression that promotes resistance to genotoxic drugs. In this signature, downregulation of miR-205,
can be mediated by an imbalance in the p73/DNp73 ratio or by dysregulation of other cancer-related regulators of
miR-205 expression such as TGFb-1 or TWIST1. In addition, we found that a genetic signature composed of high
E2F1, low miR-205, and high ERBB3 can render tumor cells insensitive to both cytostatic and genotoxic drugs. Our
model simulations also suggested that conventional genotoxic drug treatment favors selection of chemoresistant
cells in genetically heterogeneous tumors, in a manner requiring dysregulation of incoherent feedforward loops
that involve E2F1, p73/DNp73, and miR-205. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3511–24. 2013 AACR.

Major Findings
Our model analysis indicates that tumor cells showing a
genetic signature composed of high E2F1, low miR-205, and
high ERBB3 expression can be resistant to multiple types of
anticancer drugs. Furthermore, we found that the deregulation
of E2F1 signaling can promote chemoresistance in concert
with some epithelial–mesenchymal transition signals via common miRNA targets. Our analysis shows that the E2F1 signaling network is enriched in feedforward loops, the deregulation
of which can play a decisive role in the emergence of chemoresistance. Finally, we found that in in silico heterogeneous
tumors with cells displaying different signatures for the E2F1
signaling network, genotoxic drugs can favor the selection of
subpopulations of chemoresistant tumor cells.

Introduction
Resistance to genotoxic drugs as the major cause of cancer
therapy failure is a serious problem for oncologists and their
patients that requires the understanding of the pivotal triggering events and its evolution when cancer progresses. Chemoresistance can be innate or acquired and may attributable
to a single agent or a class of drugs. Potential mechanisms to
counteract the therapeutic effects of DNA-damaging agents
include the reduction of effective drug concentrations via
enhanced efﬂux, detoxiﬁcation enzymes or drug sequestration,
modiﬁcation of drug targets, changes or mutation in mitotic
checkpoint signals, and hyperactivation of DNA repair
mechanisms (1).
The cellular transcription factor E2F1 is a unique member of
the E2F family of proteins as it regulates the tumor suppressor

Quick Guide to Main Model Equations and Assumptions
The kinetic model is organized in four interconnected modules: a core regulatory module, transcriptional modules related
to apoptosis and proliferation, and an additional module for the tumor cell population.
The core regulatory module contains ﬁve differential equations, accounting for E2F1 mRNA and protein (mE2F1 and E2F1),
both isoforms of p73 (respectively, p73 and DNp73), and miR-205 (miR205). The most relevant equation describes the dynamics of
miR-205:


dmiR205
DNp73 2
1
 k12  miR205
¼ k11  TGFB1  p73  1 þ
dt
k13
This equation describes the regulation of miR-205 synthesis and degradation (k11, k12). Here, we assume that p73 acts as an
activator of miR-205 synthesis, whereas DNp73 plays an inhibitory role. According to the observations reported in several tumor
types, we assume that when both isoforms of p73 are overexpressed, the inhibitory effect of DNp73 dominates and cancels out p73
activation of miR-205. To exemplify the set of regulators of miR-205 that are external to the E2F1/p73/miR-205 network, we include
a term that describes the repression of miR-205 by the oncogenic signal coming from the TGFb-1 pathway (TGFB1).
The module for apoptosis-related targets includes three differential equations, accounting for the dynamics of E2F1-regulated
proapoptotic genes (represented by Hrk), p73-regulated proapoptotic genes (represented by Bax), and miR-205–repressed
antiapoptotic genes (represented by BCL2). The most representative equation for this module accounts for Hrk dynamics:
dHrk
E2F 1g
 k18  Hrk
¼ k17  DS 
k16 g þ E2F 1g
dt
This equation describes the regulation of Hrk synthesis and degradation (k17, k18). In this equation, we include the E2F1mediated expression of Hrk using a Hill function. In addition, we assume that DNA damage signals trigger acetylation and
activation of E2F1, which is required to promote Hrk expression. Drug-induced DNA damage signals are here encoded as a binary
variable (DS).
The module for targets associated with proliferation includes ordinary differential equations for the de novo inactive EGFR
(EGFR), growth factor-activated EGFR (EGFR ), cytostatic drug–inhibited EGFR (EGFRI), and active ERBB3 (ERBB3). In this
module, the most important equation describes the dynamics of EGFRI:
! 

dEGFRI
E2F1g2
ERBB3 1

I

EGFR

EGFR
 k31  EGFRI
¼ k30  CyD  k36 

1
þ
ERTH
dt
k35g2 þ E2F1g2
The ﬁrst term accounts for the inhibition of EGFR by cytostatic drugs (CyD), which converts EGFR into inactive form (EGFRI).
Here, we assume that the expression of EGFR is regulated by E2F1, which is modeled with a Hill equation (k36, g2). We include a
power-law term accounting for the effect of ERBB3 as an inhibitor of the cytostatic drugs regulating EGFR activity (ER).
The tumor cell population module is composed of an ordinary differential equation accounting for the size of a population of
tumor cells with the considered genetic signature (TC). This equation is a phenomenological kinetic equation that connects the
components of the regulatory network to the dynamics of the tumor cell population:


dTC
BCL2 1
¼ k24  EGFR  TC  k22  Hrk  Bax  1 þ
 TC
dt
k23
In this equation, active EGFR (EGFR ) connects the proliferation of the tumor cell population to proliferative signals (k24),
whereas the representatives for pro- and antiapoptotic proteins (Hrk, Bax, and BCL2) regulate the cell death rate after genotoxic
stress (k22, k23).
In some simulations, we consider tumors composed of three subpopulations of tumor cells with different genetic signatures.
Accordingly, we construct three instances of the model, which differ in model parameter values describing the different genetic
signatures. Further details are available in the main text and Supplementary Material.

increase the sensitivity of malignant cells to apoptosis upon

Chemoresistance in the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 Network

reduction (5). In this regard, activation of p73 by E2F1 functions as backup once p53 is defective to ensure that damaged
cells can undergo apoptosis (6,7). In such a scenario, high levels
of endogenous E2F1 should increase the effectiveness of DNAdamaging agents and discriminate between tumors clinically
responsive or resistant to anticancer therapy. This is in line
with clinical surveys that associated E2F1 expression with
improved survival in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and underscores E2F10 s role as an endogenous chemosensitizer in patients with cancer and beyond, as a predictive factor for therapeutic success and clinical outcome (8).
This beneﬁcial view on E2F1 was thwarted as other studies
showed that overexpression or ampliﬁcation of the E2F1
genomic locus in conjunction with RB1 loss frequently
observed during cancer progression is associated with metastatic disease and chemoresistance (9). From this perspective,
aberrantly elevated E2F1 levels in high-grade tumors can be
considered as a marker for unfavorable patient survival prognosis. In support of these ﬁndings, we have recently shown
that dysregulated E2F1 causes malignant progression in therapy-resistant metastatic melanoma xenografts in which depletion of endogenously high E2F1 levels abrogates tumor invasion and pulmonary metastasis (10). According to our results,
the aggressive behavior of E2F1 in melanoma cells is partially
mediated through the induction of the EGF receptor (EGFR)
pathway.
It is well established that E2F1 stimulates the expression
of the tumor suppressor p73 and its N-terminally truncated
isoform (named DNp73) via direct transactivation of the TP73
gene (11). While full-length p73 inhibits cancer development by
inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through its ability to
bind p53 DNA target sites, DNp73 acts as antagonist of wildtype p53 family members by either directly interfering with
DNA binding or forming inactive heteromeric complexes with
transcriptionally active p73 (12). Strikingly, in melanoma
metastases DNp73 isoforms are strongly upregulated in conjunction with full-length p73 compared with primary tumors
(13). Because of the previous results, DNp73 exhibits antiapoptotic activity in human melanoma cells and speciﬁc suppression of individual isoforms enhances the sensitivity towards
cytotoxic drugs (14). Investigating mechanisms responsible for
dysregulated E2F1 losing its apoptotic function in human skin
cancer, we identiﬁed miR-205 as a speciﬁc target of p73 and
found that upon genotoxic stress its expression is sufﬁciently
abrogated by endogenous DNp73 (15). Signiﬁcantly, we showed
that metastatic cells can be rescued from drug resistance by
selective knockdown of DNp73 or overexpression of miR-205
in p73 depleted cells, leading to increased apoptosis and the reduction of tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest the E2F1p73/DNp73-miR-205 network as a crucial mechanism for chemoresistance and thus as a target for prevention of metastasis.
The structure of the E2F1-centered biochemical network
that mediates the potential resistance against anticancer
therapies is a complex system involving signaling and transcriptional regulation. This network is enriched with network
motifs, including feedback and feedforward loops. Furthermore, these network motifs are well interconnected, overlap,
and cross-talk with other cancer-related signaling pathways

www.aacrjournals.org

(4, 16). Networks containing several of these motifs often
show nonintuitive regulatory patterns, which require the use
of mathematical modeling to understand their function and
regulation (17,18).
In this work, we constructed a regulatory map that summarizes the current literature on E2F1 signaling dysregulation
in cancer and complemented it with information about E2F1
and miR-205 targets, which have known or putative roles in
drug response. On the basis of this map, we derived a mathematical model and used it to investigate under which conditions dysregulation of this network provides tumor cells with
resistance mechanisms against several families of anticancer
drugs. In connection to this, we further explored the consequences of tumor heterogeneity in the effectiveness of these
therapies. Our results indicate that kinetic modeling under the
systems biology paradigm can be an effective method to detect
genetic signatures providing tumor cells with chemoresistance
mechanisms and thereby to design therapeutic strategies to
counteract them.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, PCR, Western blot, and apoptosis assays
The human melanoma cell line SK-Mel-147 characterized by
morphology and cytogenetics was obtained from M. Soengas
(Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI). Tested and authenticated cells were cultured as described (15). Plasmid miRZIP205 encoding antagomir-205 was purchased from BioCat.
Transfections were conducted with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Adenoviral vector with shE2F1 was described previously (10). Expression of hsa-miR-205 and hsa-RNU6B (for
normalization) was detected using speciﬁc TaqMan assays
(Applied Biosystems). PCR, Western blot, and apoptosis assays
were conducted as described. The wet lab data were obtained
previously and are published in (15).
Regulatory map construction
Information about the network components and their interactions was extracted from relevant published reports and
databases (HPRD and STRING for protein–protein interactions; TRED for E2F1 transcriptional targets; TarBase 6.0,
miRTarBase, miRecords and miR2Disease for validated targets
of miR-205; and TransmiR for transcription factors regulating
the expression of miR-205). Putative miR-205 targets and miR205 transcription regulators were extracted from additional
databases (see Supplementary Materials and Methods for a
detailed description of the data retrieval process). As we were
interested in the role of E2F1 and miR-205 in pro- and antiapoptotic processes as well as in drug responses, we ﬁltered the
obtained set of molecular interactions based on the corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) terms (GO:0043065, GO:0043066
and GO:0042493). Finally, all the information collected was
integrated into a regulatory map in Cytoscape (available in
Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Kinetic modeling
Representative interactions in the constructed regulatory
map were translated into a kinetic model based on ordinary

differential equations. The model constructed accounts for the
dynamics of miRNA, mRNA and protein expression levels, as
well as cell populations in different cancer-relevant scenarios,

where Proti accounts for the expression level of the proteins
involved in the network, mRNAi for the messenger RNAs

expression of given proteins, and Ci for the size of proliferative,
arrested, or apoptotic cell populations. GS is an input signal
that accounts for the effect of genotoxic or cytostatic drugs in
the synthesis and regulation of proteins and mRNAs. Dk1, Fk1
and Gk2 account for the description of biochemical processes
as rate equations that depend on the expression levels of
proteins and mRNAs, or the time-dependent genotoxic stress
signal GS. Hk3 are rate equations describing the dependence of
cell population dynamics on the expression level of critical
proteins in the network. Values of the model parameters
characterizing the reaction rates were assigned following a
hybrid strategy, composed of: (i) extracting parameter values
from published information (e.g., protein, mRNA, and miRNA
half-lives); (ii) estimating a subset of parameter values by
tuning them to ﬁt published quantitative and qualitative data;
(iii) reducing some parameters by normalizing variables
around the basal, nonstressed levels of mRNA and protein.
Model equations and chosen parameter values are provided in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
In silico cell lines. To search for genetic signatures providing tumor cells with a chemoresistant phenotype, we produced in silico (kinetic model-based) cell lines by randomly
perturbing values of selected model parameters using Latin
hypercube sampling. Thereby, we generated 105 in silico cell
lines, each one with a distinctive set of parameter values
accounting for an individual genetic background.
Model simulations
For each in silico cell line, we conducted simulations in 3
cancer relevant scenarios: (i) nonstressed growth conditions;
(ii) apoptosis under; and (iii) proliferation under cytostatic
drug administration. We investigated genetic signatures providing the tumor cells with a chemoresistant phenotype, by
randomly perturbing parameter values and simulating the
response of the model to different cancer-relevant scenarios.
We analyzed the effects of perturbations in the expression

levels of critical network components by iteratively modifying
their synthesis rate constants accounting for their induction
and simulating the behavior of the network. We assessed
the efﬁcacy of conventional anticancer treatment in in silico
cells with different E2F1-related genetic signatures by simulating periodic cycles of genotoxic or cytostatic drug injection.
Model calibration, computational simulations, and data analysis were conducted using MATLAB running on a high-end
workstation Fujitsu Celsius V840, 2x CPU AMD Opteron 2214,

the regulatory map, as well as about the model structure,
calibration, and analysis is included in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
A network with multiple feedforward loops determines
the E2F1 drug response
Our recent results suggest that the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR205 pathway is involved in the regulation of pro- and antiapoptotic genes, which confers chemoresistance (15). We
investigated whether this system is part of a wider and more
complex network regulating the response of tumor cells to
anticancer drugs. Towards this end, we constructed a regulatory map that contains the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 pathway
as core module and includes genes targeted by E2F1 or miR205, with known or putative relation to the drug response and
drug-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Overall, the map unravels a
tightly interlocked regulatory system. Computational analysis
of the network (81 nodes, 194 edges) shows a robust structure
and a topology that is composed of many regulatory motifs,
especially enriched in feedforward loops (for details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods). Interestingly, we detected
several instances of network motifs in which a direct E2F1
target gene interacts with a miR-205–repressed target. Because
E2F1 regulates miR-205 via p73, processes downstream of the
interaction between both targets are regulated by E2F1 following 2 independent routes and can be considered as feedforward loop (Fig 1A). Several of those loops are associated with
the efﬁcient apoptosis initiation and involve the positive
regulation of proapoptotic genes by E2F1 and the repression
of antiapoptotic genes by miR-205. For example, the E2F1
target Hrk regulates apoptosis through interaction with the
miR-205 targets BCL-2 and BCL-XL (Fig 1A; ref. 19). In addition,
we detected at least one additional instance of this motif, in
which E2F1 promotes EGFR expression and miR-205 represses
ERBB3 (both belonging to the HER receptor family). In several
tumors, both receptors are associated with abnormal proliferation and upon heterodimerization they inﬂuence sensitivity
to cytostatic drugs like erlotinib (20). Furthermore, DNp73 can
inhibit the expression of p73 transcriptional targets, including
miR-205. The expression of these targets may depend on a tight
trade-off between p73 and DNp73 expression and activity,
which are both transcriptionally regulated by E2F1. These
E2F1-p73/DNp73-target motifs can be considered as incoherent feedforward loops. Overall, the activation of miR-205 and
therefore of its targets may depend on the interplay among
E2F1, p73, DNp73, and other regulators of miR-205 like TWIST1

whereas solid lines represent validated interactions and dashed lines denote predicted interactions. B, kinetic model for the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205
network. The model is composed of four modules: The core regulatory module (blue) describes the dynamics of E2F1, p73, DNp73, and miR-205. The
transcriptional targets module accounts for representative apoptosis and proliferation-associated targets of E2F1, p73, and miR-205, which may play a role in
drug response. The tumor cell population module connects the biochemical network to the fate of a population of tumor cells. GxD accounts for genotoxic and
CyD for cytostatic drug; red-colored symbols for oncogenes and green for tumor suppressors. Twelve ordinary differential equations accounting for the
evolution in time of: E2F1 mRNA (in the model represented with the variable mE2F1) and protein (E2F1), both isoforms of p73 (respectively, p73 and DNp73),
miR-205 (miR205), E2F1-regulated proapoptotic genes (Hrk), p73-regulated proapoptotic genes (Bax), miR-205–repressed antiapoptotic genes (BCL2),
E2F1-regulated and active EGFR (EGFR ), cytostatic drug–inhibited EGFR (EGFRI), and miR-205–repressed ERBB3 (ERBB3). In addition, we consider
another differential equation accounting for the population size of tumor cells with the genetic background deﬁned by our model (TC). The node size is in
accordance to its degree (i.e., number of edges connected). C, prototypical simulation made with the model. Upon administration of a drug at t ¼ 0, genotoxic
stress is triggered (top). This activates the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 network (middle), which in turn promotes the transcription of apoptosis-related genes
(middle). When proapoptotic genes are sufﬁciently expressed, they trigger apoptosis and the population of tumor cell decreases (bottom).

Because of the network complexity, mathematical modeling is
necessary to investigate nonintuitive regulation of this system
in cancer-relevant scenarios.
A modularized kinetic model to investigate E2F1-p73/
DNp73-miR-205 network chemosensivity
We set up and analyzed a kinetic model using ordinary
differential equations. To construct the model, we selected
parts of the regulatory map that are representative for the
network response to different anticancer drugs (Fig. 1B). The
model is organized into four interconnected modules: the core
regulatory module, two modules of transcriptional targets, and
one for tumor cell population. The core regulatory module of
the kinetic model is composed of E2F1, both isoforms of p73
(respectively, p73 and DNp73) and miR-205 (miR-205) and
accounts for their temporal evolution under drug administration (15). We include here the transcriptional regulation of
miR-205 expression by the known oncogene TGFb-1 (TGFB1),
which exempliﬁes the set of regulators of miR-205 expression
external to the core module. The inclusion of this variable
allows for the investigation of cross-talk, via miR-205, between
E2F1 signaling and other oncogenic signals involved in the

3516

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT has been associated with the emergence of chemoresistance (21).
In addition, the model includes a module for pro- and
antiapoptotic transcriptional targets, which are regulated by
the network components in response to genotoxic stress.
Precisely: (i) for representing the dynamics of proapoptotic
proteins whose expression is promoted by E2F1, we included a
variable accounting for Harakiri expression (22); (ii) similarly,
for proapoptotic proteins whose expression is positively regulated by p73 and negatively regulated by DNp73, a variable
accounting for Bax expression is deﬁned (23); and ﬁnally (iii)
for antiapoptotic proteins whose expression is repressed by
miR-205, we chose BCL2 as a representative and deﬁned a
corresponding variable (15). These pro- and antiapoptotic
proteins are used here as an example and represent a wider
set of proteins which undergo similar regulation. This kind of
simpliﬁcation has been successfully applied to reduce the
complexity of models of biochemical networks, for example,
in the study conducted by Aguda and colleagues (24). Furthermore, the model includes a module for receptors whose activity
is regulated in response to cytostatic drugs. This module
includes variables accounting for the dynamics of EGFR, whose
expression is promoted by E2F1 (10), and ERBB3, which is

Chemoresistance in the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 Network

Genetic signatures for the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205
network that confer chemoresistance to anticancer
drugs
In our analysis, we considered two families of drugs: genotoxic drugs, like doxorubicin and cisplatin, inducing apoptosis;
and cytostatic drugs, like erlotinib and lapatinib, repressing
tumor cell proliferation. In some scenarios, it has been
observed that these drugs lose efﬁcacy when some of the
network components are dysregulated (15,27). With the help
of the kinetic model, we analyzed whether speciﬁc genetic
signatures of the core module can be linked to a phenotype
response of resistance to these anticancer drugs. We deﬁne a
genetic signature as a group of genes in a tumor cell whose
combined expression pattern is linked to a speciﬁc phenotype
(i.e., chemoresistant or chemosensitive). In line with this, we
designed a nominal in silico chemosensitive genetic signature,
inspired by that of SK-Mel-147 (15). This signature accounts for
the expression of the network components for which an in
silico cell line holds the phenotype of a chemosensitive tumor
cell; that is, abnormal proliferation but responsiveness to
genotoxic drugs (via triggering of apoptosis) and cytostatic
drugs (via inhibition of proliferation, see Fig. 2B).
To detect genetic signatures providing chemoresistance, we
generated a population of 104 model conﬁgurations obtained
by random perturbation of the model parameter values of the
nominal chemosensitive genetic signature. In the following, we
deﬁne these distinct conﬁgurations as in silico cell lines. For
each one of them, we simulate the model and obtained the
expression levels of the network components and the tumor
cell population in three cancer-relevant scenarios: (i) under
nonstress conditions, at time zero, and after 120 hours; (ii) after
genotoxic drug administration, at 48 hours; and (iii) after
cytostatic drug administration, at 120 hours. The in silico cell
lines were classiﬁed into the following groups: (i) cell lines that
show abnormal proliferation in nonstress conditions, named
as tumor cells; (ii) those resistant to genotoxic drugs; (iii) those
resistant to cytostatic drugs; and (iv) those resistant to both

repressed by miR-205 (25,26). In several tumors the heterodimerization of these receptors has been linked to abnormal
cell proliferation and changes in the sensitivity of tumor cells to
cytostatic drugs (20). Additional input variables account for the
effect of genotoxic (GxD) and cytostatic (CyD) drugs triggering
DNA damage-E2F1–mediated apoptosis and abolishment of
tumor cell proliferation, respectively (4).
Finally, the last module includes a phenomenological kinetic
equation, which connects the components of the network to
the dynamics of the tumor cell population. In this equation, the
representatives for pro- and antiapoptotic proteins regulate
the cell death rate after genotoxic stress, whereas EGFR and
ERBB3 control the tumor cell proliferation rate. Taken together, our model is able to describe the cascade of regulatory
events after drug administration including stress signals,
downstream intracellular responses, the regulation of proand antiapoptotic signals (for genotoxic drugs) or proliferative
signals (for cytostatic drugs), and ﬁnally the global effect on
tumor cell population (Fig. 1C; see Supplementary Materials
and Methods for a complete description of the model).

to genotoxic drugs. A, model simulations. For different values of the
synthesis rates for E2F1 and miR-205 (kE2F1 ; kmir205 2 ½101 ; 101 ), we
determined the percentage of apoptotic cells 48 hours after genotoxic

describing the expression levels of the network components

percentage of apoptotic cells 48 hours after genotoxic drug
administration. As shown in Fig. 3A, in silico cell lines with high
levels of E2F1 display lower percentage of apoptotic cells in
response to chemotherapy. Our previous experiments with
melanoma SK-Mel-147 cells conﬁrm the simulation results
(Fig. 3B). SK-Mel-147 cells were treated with cisplatin and high
percentage of cells became apoptotic (Scenario 1 in Fig. 3B).
Inhibition of miR-205 with antagomir-205 reduces the percentage of apoptotic cells after treatment (Scenario 2), whereas
selective knockdown of endogenously high E2F1 leads to a
pronounced increase in apoptosis (Scenario 3). Finally, repression of both E2F1 and miR-205 reduces the apoptotic effect of
cisplatin (Scenario 4). These experimental results conﬁrm the
model predictions displayed in Fig. 3A for the scenarios named
with the same numbers.
To verify whether dysregulation of couples of network
components affects chemosensitivity to genotoxic and cytostatic drugs, we conducted additional simulations in which we
iteratively modiﬁed the values of the protein synthesis rates
(Fig 4). Precisely: (i) because the p73/DNp73 ratio is known to
play a major role in the aggressiveness of cancer cells
(11, 28, 29), we iteratively modiﬁed the parameters accounting

DNp73, whereas miR-205 is downregulated compared with the
nominal chemosensitive tumor cell and the group of in silico
tumor cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, approximately 1% of the cell
lines display resistance to cytostatic drugs. These cells have a
genetic signature composed of much higher basal E2F1,
DNp73, and ERBB3 levels, whereas miR-205 appears strongly
downregulated and TGFb-1 is moderately upregulated. In both
cases, EGFR is expressed at its maximum level, but our analysis
indicates that this is a property already acquired by the group
of tumor cells as a consequence of high levels of E2F1 (see
Supplementary Materials and Methods). Finally, a small fraction of the cell lines display a phenotype of double resistance
and their genetic signature is very similar to that of cytostatic
drug–resistant cells.
Taken together, our results suggest a relevant role for E2F1,
DNp73, and miR-205 in the regulation of resistance to several
anticancer drugs. To validate this model-based prediction, we
compared them with our recently published data on the
interplay of E2F1 and miR-205 under genotoxic stress administration (15). To this end, we conducted simulations in which
we iteratively perturbed the values of the parameter accounting for E2F1 and miR-205 induction and computed the

Chemoresistance in the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 Network

signatures conferring chemoresistance. We note that in our
model, the regulation of antiapoptotic genes like BCL-2 and
ERBB3 by E2F1, p73/DNp73, and TGFb-1 is mediated via miR205. Therefore, we hypothesize that the coregulation of miR205 by its transcriptional regulation can foster chemoresistance (Fig. 4D).

for p73 and DNp73 synthesis; ii) given that overexpression of
E2F1 is associated with aggressiveness and chemoresistance
(4,15), we also considered iterative modulation of E2F1 and
DNp73 synthesis parameters to test whether their dysregulation sufﬁces to induce resistance; (iii) considering that
dysregulation of TGFb-1 signaling promotes invasion and
metastasis (30), we modiﬁed the E2F1 synthesis parameter
and TGFb-1 expression level to investigate whether they can
synergize in the emergence of a resistance phenotype; and (iv)
given that the expression of ERBB3 associates to the resistance
to certain cytostatic drugs (20,31,32), we modiﬁed E2F1 and
ERBB3 synthesis parameters to test whether their combined
dysregulation can cause enhanced chemoresistance.
As shown in Fig. 4A, in silico cell lines with strong DNp73
and/or weak p73 synthesis display a very high percentage of
cells resisting apoptosis after genotoxic drug administration,
whereas strong p73 synthesis and reduced DNp73 induction
provide efﬁcient cell death. Furthermore, our kinetic simulations suggest that very strong E2F1 induction alone is sufﬁcient
to provoke chemoresistance to genotoxic drugs and can therefore compensate low DNp73 levels (Fig. 4B). In addition, high
induction of TGFb-1 reduces the level of E2F1 required to
induce resistance. Taken together, strong E2F1 synthesis can
synergize with strong induction of DNp73 and TGFb-1 to
provide genotoxic drug resistance (Fig. 4A). When analyzing
the emergence of resistance to cytostatic drugs through the
considered network, our analysis indicates that strong ERBB3
and E2F1 induction can synergize to achieve chemoresistance
(Fig. 4B). Taken together, the results suggest that resistance to
both genotoxic and cytostatic drugs can emerge with strong
ERBB3 and E2F1 induction. We summarized our results in a
qualitative manner in Fig. 4C, which lists possible genetic

Conventional genotoxic drug treatment favors selection
of chemoresistant cells in genetically heterogeneous
tumors
It is a well-established fact that cell populations with different genetic signatures inﬂuencing cancer hallmarks coexist
in malignant tumors (33). In line with this, we used our kinetic
model to investigate how tumor heterogeneity (i.e., coexistence
of several populations with different genetic signatures) affects
the efﬁcacy of conventional anticancer therapy (Fig 5). In our
analysis, we focused on genotoxic drugs. Towards this end, we
reformulated our model to consider two kinds of tumors: (i)
tumors with homogeneous expression of E2F1 and (ii) tumors
with heterogeneous expression of E2F1. In our simulations,
heterogeneity in E2F1 expression is modeled by making 90% of
cells with a deﬁned E2F1 level, 5% cells with 0.5-fold downregulation, and 5% cells with 2.5-fold upregulation of E2F1. In
accordance with our previous simulations, we considered two
biologic scenarios: E2F1 overexpression (101, represented by
E2F1~) and extreme overexpression (102, represented by
E2F1~~).
We used the model to simulate the effect of an anticancer
treatment composed of periodic injections of a conventional

one in chemoresistant cells (upregulation of E2F1 and downregulation of miR-205, Fig. 6C). Strikingly, we were able to
conﬁrm our prediction with experiments, in which we stimulated SK-Mel-147 cells with iteratively increasing levels of
cisplatin (1–50 mmol/L) and measured E2F1 and miR-205
expression before and after the treatment with this genotoxic
drug (respectively
and

tumor with homogenous E2F1 extreme overexpression, our
simulation suggests that the tumor is resistant to the therapy
and recovers fast growth afterwards (Fig. 5 top right). Interestingly, in a tumor with heterogeneous E2F1 overexpression,
the tumor becomes virtually abolished after several cycles of
drug injection, but the tumor reemerges after the drug injections are discontinued (Fig. 5 bottom left). Finally, for a tumor
with heterogeneous E2F1 extreme overexpression, model
simulations indicate that the tumor is fully drug resistant with
continuous proliferation (Fig. 5 bottom right).
We further analyzed the scenario of heterogeneous E2F1
overexpression and found that in our simulations during the
treatment, the composition of the tumor shifts from one of
predominantly chemosensitive cells at time point zero (Fig. 6A,
dark blue curve) towards a composition of entirely genotoxicdrug resistant cells at twenty weeks (Fig. 6A, red curve). This
suggests that the genotoxic drug treatment can induce selective pressure on tumor cells. This is because chemosensitive
cells undergo apoptosis during treatment, whereas cells with
the resistant genotype withstand and continue proliferating.
Therefore, the tumor reemerges after discontinuation of the
treatment after 20 weeks (Fig. 6B). Our simulations indicate
that during treatment the genetic signature of E2F1 and miR-

Discussion
E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 network mediates
chemoresistance
We developed a kinetic model to investigate the emergence
of chemoresistance in tumor cells, mediated by a network with
a core module composed of E2F1, p73, DNp73, and miR-205. In
previous efforts, mathematical modeling was applied to
address the role of E2F1 and other network components in
cancer and cell proliferation (24, 34–36). However, to our
knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst modeling-based analysis of
E2F1-mediated chemoresistance.
Our results suggest that dysregulation of this network can
provoke chemoresistance to multiple anticancer drugs. In line

Chemoresistance in the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 Network

expression in some tumors (38,40). Furthermore, our simulations indicate that when E2F1 is upregulated, high levels of
TGFb-1 or other EMT-related signals regulating miR-205,
external to the E2F1 network, can provoke genotoxic drug
resistance in cancer cells. This suggests an intriguing hypothesis, in which E2F1 signaling cross talks and synergizes with
some EMT-related signals, and their regulation of common
miRNAs can mediate this synergy in the context of chemoresistance (Fig. 7B).
Moreover, our analysis gives additional insights into the
resistance to cytostatic drugs that inhibit the activation of
HER receptor family members. We found a genetic signature
composed of high E2F1, low miR-205, and high ERBB3 that
can render tumor cells insensitive to cytostatic drugs. As
cited before, miR-205 posttranscriptionally represses ERBB3.
Interestingly, recent results suggest that tumor cell lines
sensitive to erlotinib show high levels of miR-205 and other
miRNAs (41), which supports our predictions. According to
our model analysis, tumor cells with E2F1 overexpression
and miR-205 downregulation do not show cytostatic drug
resistance, but synergy with high ERBB3 gene activation is
required to acquire this feature. In addition, the simulations
suggest that in most of the cases, this genetic signature can
lead to double resistance, this means the tumor cells become
insensitive to some genotoxic and cytostatic drugs at the
same time, a feature that may have important consequences
in the design of personalized cancer treatments. The underlying molecular mechanism providing this double resistance
is to be further elucidated.
Taken together, our results indicate that differences in the
expression of some of the proteins in this network are critical
for tumor cells to become chemoresistant, and that this
resistance is substantiated through regulatory loops including

with this, our model unraveled several genetic signatures of
tumor cells that can promote chemoresistance. Regarding
genotoxic drugs, we found a signature of high E2F1 and low
miR-205 expression that promotes resistance. Downregulation
of miR-205 in this signature can be mediated by an imbalance
in the p73/DNp73 ratio or by the dysregulation of other cancerrelated pathways like TGFb-1 signaling, whose components
positively or negatively regulate miR-205 expression (37,38).
With respect to the imbalance in the p73/DNp73 ratio, our
simulations predict that tumors with high E2F1 and normal/
high DNp73 expression show a higher percentage of surviving
cells after genotoxic stress than tumors expressing high E2F1
and low DNp73. This supports the idea that DNp73-mediated
repression of miR-205 is a mechanism by which drug resistance
is achieved. Because DNp73 is promoted by E2F1, high levels of
E2F1 can induce chemoresistance via the E2F1-DNp73-miR205 axis due to the negative regulation of miR-205 by DNp73
(Fig. 7A). However, DNp73 is upregulated in melanoma metastases with a concomitant rise of the full-length p73, a positive
regulator of miR-205 (13). Taken together, this module has the
structure of an incoherent feedforward loop. This suggests that
the speciﬁc ratio between both p73 isoforms expression and
activity determines the functional outcome of E2F1 and cell
fate upon genotoxic treatment. This ratio is regulated in
malignant melanoma by as yet unknown factors involved in
alternative splicing of p73 pre-mRNA, possibly independent of
E2F1 (39). In tumor cells with high E2F1 induction, our analysis
indicates that downregulation of DNp73 and/or upregulation
of p73 can restore chemosensitivity, which emphasizes the
importance of the p73/DNp73 ratio.
When constructing the network, we found that some proteins involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), like TGFb-1, BMP, or TWIST1 can regulate miR-205

Figure 7. A, E2F1-regulated shift of the p73/DNp73 ratio can induce nonmonotonic, nonlinear regulation of miR-205 expression. The peak of miR-205
expression is reached for intermediate E2F1 levels and downregulation for very high E2F1 expression. This system is an incoherent feedforward
loop and, according to our hypothesis, nonlinear regulation of the branches in the feedforward loop switches the status of the feedforward loop from one in
which the positive branch predominates (e.g., p73 ~) and promotes target expression to another in which the negative branch predominates (e.g.,
DNp73~) and the target expression is repressed. B, feedforward loops involved in the E2F1-mediated chemosensitivity may be active regulatory structures,
whose activation may depend on the cross-talk between E2F1 and other cancer-related signals.

miR-205. We note that the predictions we made are based on
qualitative modeling, similar to those made in the studies
conducted by Aguda and colleagues and Yao and colleagues
(28,39). To make the predictions of our model quantitative, the
model should be further reﬁned in iterative cycles of experimentation and model calibration (17,18).
In the model parameterization analyzed, the feedback loop
between E2F1 and miR-205 has minor effects in the dynamics
of the network. Our previous results of modeling miRNA
regulation of cancer-related genes suggest that the strength
of miRNA regulation is context-dependent and may be affected
by the coregulation of other miRNAs or proteins (42). Thus, we
hypothesize that this feedback loop could be negligible in the
scenarios investigated in this article, but still crucial in other
biologic contexts which have not been investigated in this
paper. In this way, miR-205–mediated repression of some
antiapoptotic targets in our network may be affected by similar
coregulation. Our modeling results complement those of
Aguda and colleagues (24) and others (43) who also used
kinetic modeling to investigate the role of miRNA regulation
on E2F1 in cancer. Aguda and colleagues (24) found that the
coupling between the E2F/Myc positive feedback loop and the
E2F/Myc/miR-17-92 negative feedback loop is crucial to regulate a bistable on–off switch in E2F/Myc protein levels, a
feature that is critical in the dysregulation of E2F1 activity
during cancer progression. We here claim that E2F1-mediated
regulation of miRNAs may as well be critical to explain the
emergence of chemoresistance.
Finally, our simulations indicate that tumor heterogeneity
in terms of the genetic signature of the E2F1-p73/DNp73miR-205 network can affect the efﬁcacy of anticancer therapy. In addition, our simulations suggest that the therapy
can induce selective pressure on tumor cells favoring those
showing chemoresistance. Other authors have suggested
that under conditions of tumor genetic instability, heterogeneous tumors contain populations of one or more resistant clones (44, 45). These resistant subpopulations can be
residual compared with other clones in a pretreated tumor
due to the phenotypic cost associated with chemoresistance,
but could get favored when the anticancer therapy is
applied (46). This hypothesis is supported by our results.
In our analysis, we only considered the role of the E2F1-p73/
DNp73-miR205 network in developing chemoresistance.
However, these molecules interact with additional genes
involved in the regulation of other phenotypic responses
and therefore display pleiotropy (4,16). Thus, it is possible
that some features of the resistant phenotype here described
may have negative effect on other cancer-associated traits,
which are out of the scope of this article. In a more realistic
case, one could enrich the analysis by expanding the network
with interaction partners representative of these other phenotypes and conducting a more extensive analysis.
Design principles underlying chemoresistance
Our analysis indicates that the network under investigation
is enriched in feedforward loops. Most of these motifs are
central to the efﬁcient apoptosis initiation after genotoxic
stress and therefore their dysregulation can cause chemore-

sistance (47,48). Previous publications have emphasized the
important role of feedforward loops regulating the transient
dynamics of biochemical pathways (49). We here support the
hypothesis that these loops may further control important
features of the long-term response in signaling and transcriptional systems. The paradigmatic case is the regulation of miR205 by p73 (positive) and DNp73 (negative), two transcriptional
targets of E2F1. This system is a canonical case of an incoherent feedforward loop. Several publications suggest that the
regulation and activity of p73 and DNp73 is nonlinear and
varies for different levels of E2F1 expression (28,50). Under
these conditions, our simulations indicate that the incoherent
feedforward loop allows a single protein (e.g., E2F1) to nonmonotonically regulate components downstream of the loop
(e.g., miR-205; see Fig. 7A). Thus, for an interval of E2F1
expression levels the incoherent feedforward loop is dominated by the p73-mediated positive branch and promotes expression of miR-205. However, for higher expression of E2F1, the
negative, DNp73-mediated branch predominates and the
downstream target is repressed (Fig. 7A). This suggests that
incoherent feedforward loops can be active structures of
regulation when the different branches of the loops get distinctively regulated.
Furthermore, we identiﬁed several network motifs with the
structure of incoherent feedforward loops, in which a component downstream the network is regulated by a direct E2F1
target gene and a miR-205–regulated target. In our study, we
focus on apoptosis-related targets (e.g., BCL-2 and HRK,
see Fig. 7B). As we mentioned before, miR-205 expression is
regulated by other cancer-related signals, external to the E2F1
network (e.g., EMT-related signals). Therefore, changes in the
activity of those external signals may alter the activation status
of the antiapoptotic branch and as a consequence the balance
between pro- and antiapoptotic signals is also altered (Fig. 7B).
In addition, miR-205 regulates proteins downstream the EMT
signaling, like E-cadherin, and some members of the BCL2
family are regulated by E2F1. This suggests the existence of
additional feedforward loops which were not investigated in
this work (25). Taken together, feedforward loops involved in
chemosensitivity can be considered active regulatory structures, whose activation status may depend on the cross-talk
with other cancer-related signals.
