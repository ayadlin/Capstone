BACKGROUND. The current study was performed to compare the nonplatinumbased combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine (GV) with the combination of
irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) as first-line chemotherapy with second-line crossover in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. Patients were randomly assigned to received either irinotecan at a
dose of 65 mg/m2 plus cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 (Arm A) or gemcitabine
at a dose of 900 mg/m2 plus vinorelbine at a dose of 25 mg/m2 (Arm B), each of
which was administered on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks as the first-line therapy

followed by crossover at the time of disease progression.

RESULTS. A total of 146 patients were enrolled (75 patients in Arm A and 71
patients in Arm B); 138 patients were evaluable for tumor response and toxicity.
During first-line therapy, IP was found to result in more grade 21 nausea and
vomiting (toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) (41% vs 12%; P 5 .0001) and alopecia (36% vs
10%; P 5 .0003). Pneumonitis was noted only with GV therapy (7% vs 0%;
P 5 .058). During second-line therapy, IP was found to result in more grade 3 diarrhea (17% vs 2%; P 5 .039) and GV featured more cases of grade 31 neutropenia (78% vs 40%; P 5 .0003). IP tended to generate more tumor responses (38%
vs 26% as first-line therapy, and 30% vs 13% as second-line therapy) compared
with GV. IP also demonstrated a favorable trend in median progression-free survival (4.6 months vs 3.8 months as first-line therapy and 4.5 months vs 2.6
months as second-line therapy) and overall survival (15.9 months vs 13.1 months;
P 5 .3), but this difference was not statistically significant. The majority of
patients who were refractory to IP also failed to respond to GV in the second-line
setting.

CONCLUSIONS. The platinum-based IP regimen appeared to be superior to the
GV combination in terms of response rate. However, given the similar survival
and better tolerability of the nonplatinum GV regimen, either treatment sequence
would appear to be acceptable for the treatment of patients with advanced
NSCLC. Cancer 2008;113:388–95.  2008 American Cancer Society.

isplatin-based chemotherapy is currently considered to be the
standard treatment for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), with modest but statistically significant improved survival
without compromising quality of life compared with best supportive
care alone.1,2 However, the cisplatin-related toxicity (including nau-

sea and vomiting, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity)
as well as the delivery problems (eg, prolonged
hydration and hospitalization) have prompted us to
search for alternative regimens. Over the last decade,
several third-generation agents such as paclitaxel,
docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and irinotecan
have been widely adopted. In general, these agents
are more tolerable and have single-agent activity that
is equal to or greater than that of cisplatin.3 Thereafter, it has become possible to explore more nonplatinum combinations of third-generation agents, such
as the regimen of gemcitabine and vinorelbine (GV),
in patients with advanced NSCLC.
A recent update of American Society of Clinical
Oncology guidelines recommended that any first-line
chemotherapy administered to advanced NSCLC
patients should be a 2-drug combination regimen
and that nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy can
be used as an alternative first-line chemotherapy.4
Moreover, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that
although third-generation platinum-containing doublets have better response rates, they also have a
higher rate of toxicity, even without providing a significant improvement in survival compared with
nonplatinum-containing doublets.5 Given the better
tolerability and similar survival rates of nonplatinum
regimens, the modern third-generation nonplatinumcontaining regimens can be a valid option for firstline therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.
The GV combination is characterized by a favorable toxicity profile and better tolerability than platinum-based regimens. In phase 2 trials, response
rates of 26% to 59% with median survival rates of 8
months to 9 months were reported.6–12 There are
several randomized phase 3 trials published to date
comparing the GV regimen with cisplatin-based regimens. Gridelli et al.13 compared GV with cisplatin
plus vinorelbine or chemotherapy with gemcitabine
alone in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced
NSCLC and demonstrated that GV therapy is similar
to standard cisplatin-based doublets with respect to
palliation as assessed by response rate and quality of
life and is less toxic, with no significant difference
noted with regard to overall survival (OS). In addition, the German and Swiss Lung Cancer Group
compared the GV regimen with GV plus cisplatin
(GVP) chemotherapy. They found that the cisplatinbased GVP regimen demonstrated no survival benefit
when used as first-line chemotherapy in patients
with advanced NSCLC compared with the cisplatinfree GV regimen, which was found to be substantially
better tolerated.14 Based on the favorable activity and
tolerability of the GV regimen in patients with
NSCLC, we conducted a phase 2 randomized trial

389

comparing the nonplatinum-based GV regimen with
a cisplatin-based modern doublet, irinotecan plus
cisplatin (IP), as the first-line chemotherapy in
patients with advanced NSCLC, with crossover occurring at the time of disease progression, to investigate
the efficacy, toxicity, and survival of these alternating
sequential treatment schedules.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligibility criteria included pathologically confirmed
stage IIIB disease with pleural effusions or stage IV
NSCLC (determined according to the American Joint
Committee on Cancer Staging Manual); age 18
years; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2; 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion; no prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy; adequate hematologic,
hepatic, and renal functions defined as a white blood
cell count 3.5 3 109/L, a platelet count 150.0 3
109/L, a serum bilirubin level 1.2 times the upper
limit of normal, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels 2.5 times the upper
limit of normal of the institutional reference range,
and serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL; and no active
infection. Patients with brain metastasis were permitted to enter the study unless there were clinically
significant neurologic symptoms or signs. Before randomization, all patients provided written informed
consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the National Cancer Center Hospital. The study was
performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
Treatment Plan
At the time of study entry, patients were randomly
assigned to treatment arms A or B using permuted
blocks within strata. Stratification factors included
disease stage (stage IIIB vs stage IV), ECOG PS (0 or
1 vs 2), and sex (male vs female).
Patients enrolled onto Arm A (IP) received cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 as a 30-minute intravenous (iv) infusion followed by irinotecan at a dose of
65 mg/m2 as a 1-hour iv infusion on Days 1 and 8 as
the first-line therapy. Patients enrolled onto Arm B
(GV) received gemcitabine at a dose of 900 mg/m2
as a 30-minute iv infusion followed by vinorelbine at
a dose of 25 mg/m2 as a 10-minute iv infusion on
Days 1 and 8 as the first-line therapy. For both treatment arms, cycles were administered every 3 weeks
and patients could undergo an unlimited number of
treatment cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. When progressive disease
had been documented, patients crossed over to the

as second-line treatment.

Assessment
The primary objective of the current study was an
assessment of OS for each treatment regimen in
patients with NSCLC; secondary objectives were the
evaluation of response rate, time to disease progression, and toxicity.
Baseline evaluations conducted before study
entry included history and physical examination,
assessment of ECOG PS, complete blood count, biochemical profile, electrocardiogram, and serum pregnancy test; assessments were conducted on Day 1 of
each treatment cycle and complete blood counts and
biochemical profiles were obtained on Days 1, 8, and
15 of each treatment cycle. Toxicity was graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). Response assessment
was performed every 3 cycles or whenever clinically
indicated. Responses were assessed according to
World Health Organization criteria.15
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this trial was 1-year OS.
The trial was designed to detect an absolute 20%
increase in the 1-year OS compared with historic
controls. The 1-year OS rate for patients treated with
cisplatin-based doublet regimens was approximately

40%. Therefore, using the 1995 statistical selection
criterion of Strauss and Simon,16 the treatment
demonstrating superior 1-year OS would be studied
further. The sample size was determined to ensure
that if the 1-year OS for 1 treatment was superior by
at least 20%, it would be selected with high probability. This study design had a 90% chance of selecting
a treatment yielding a 1-year OS of at least 60%,
assuming a rate of 40% for the historic control or alternative treatment arm. Sample size based on these
calculations stipulated a minimum of 65 patients per
arm. Assuming that 10% proved inaccessible, 146
patients were projected for accrual.
Kaplan–Meier curves were used to describe the
OS and progression-free survival (PFS), as well as the
duration of response. OS was calculated from the
first day of treatment until death or last known follow-up. PFS was calculated as the time between the
first day of treatment and disease progression, death,
or last known follow-up. The duration of response
was defined for all responders as the time between
the first demonstration of response and subsequent
failure (disease progression). The log-rank test and
hazards ratios were used to compare the differences
in survival.

median follow-up time was 32.3 months. Three of
146 eligible patients had never started protocol therapy (Arm A) and therefore 143 patients were evaluable for survival. After the initiation on Day 1 of the
first cycle of treatment, 4 eligible patients were
refused further treatment (3 in Arm A and 1 in Arm
B). One additional patient in Arm B withdrew from
further treatment after Day 1 of the first cycle
because of active pulmonary tuberculosis. These
patients were unavailable for the assessment of toxicity and response. Therefore, a total of 138 patients
(69 patients in each treatment arm) were evaluable
for toxicity and response. Among them, 94 patients
crossed over to receive alternative second-line treatment (41 in Arm A and 53 in Arm B) when progressive disease was documented, and 87 were evaluable
for response (40 patients in Arm A and 47 patients in
Arm B).
Baseline demographics were comparable for
both arms (Table 1). The median age of the patients
was 60 years. Approximately 79% of patients were
male and 90% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Approximately 87% had stage IV disease and 19% of patients
had disease of squamous histology. There was no sta-

tistically significant difference noted between the 2
treatment arms.

Objective Tumor Responses and Survival
Objective responses (complete response 1 partial
response) and disease control (complete response 1 partial response 1 stable disease) are summarized in Table 2. In the first-line therapy, the overall
response rates were 38% (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 26.3–49.1%) for Arm A and 26% (95% CI,
15.7–36.5%) for Arm B. The median response durations were 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1–7.0 months) for
Arm A and 5.8 months (95% CI, 1.0–10.7 months) for
Arm B. In the second-line therapy, the overall
response rates were 13% (95% CI, 0.7–19.3%) for Arm
A and 30% (95% CI, 16.7–42.9%) for Arm B. The median response durations were 5.0 months (95% CI,
2.6–7.5 months) for Arm A and 4.5 months (95% CI,
2.6–6.3 months) for Arm B.
The response to the GV regimen as second-line
therapy was found to be correlated with the response
to IP as first-line therapy (Table 3). The majority of
patients who developed progressive disease while
receiving IP as their first-line therapy did not

not appear to affect the response to IP as the second-line therapy (80.0% vs 28.6%; P 5 .022).
Survival data are shown in Table 2. In the firstline treatment, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS for
Arm A (IP with crossover to GV) was 4.6 months
(95% CI, 3.1–6.1 months) and was 3.8 months (95%

CI, 2.9–4.8 months) for Arm B (GV with crossover to
IP). In the second-line treatment, the Kaplan-Meier
estimate of PFS for Arm A (IP with crossover to GV)
was 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.8–3.4 months) and was
4.5 months (95% CI, 3.0–6.1 months) for Arm B (GV
with crossover to IP). Figure 1 displays Kaplan-Meier
estimates of OS by treatment arm. The median survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.8–20.0 months) for
Arm A, with a 1-year survival rate of 63.4% (95% CI,
52.2–74.6%) and a 2-year survival rate of 30.5% (95%
CI, 19.7–41.3%). The median survival for Arm B was
13.1 months (95% CI, 10.2–15.9 months), with a 1year survival rate of 56.3% (95% CI, 44.7–67.9%) and
a 2-year survival rate of 26.8% (95% CI, 16.4–37.2%).

Treatment Delivered
The median numbers of treatment cycles as the firstline treatment were 5 cycles (range, 1–20 cycles) for
Arm A (IP) and 4 cycles (range, 1–24 cycles) for Arm
B (GV). Figure 2 shows exposure to treatment in
both arms. Of the 69 patients receiving IP, 47.2%
completed >6 cycles of therapy and 11.1% received
>10 cycles. Of the 69 treated patients receiving GV,
40.8% completed >6 cycles of therapy and 11.3%
received >10 cycles. The median numbers of the second-line treatment cycles were 3 (range, 1–15 cycles)
for Arm A (GV) and 4 (range, 1–15 cycles) for Arm B

received IP as second-line therapy, 34.0% completed
>6 cycles of therapy and 15.1% received >9 cycles.

Toxicity
Toxicity is summarized in Tables 4 and 5. During the
first-line treatment comparing Arm A and Arm B,
Arm A (IP) featured more grade 2 or 3 nausea and
vomiting (41% vs 12%; P 5 .0001) and grade 2 alopecia (36% vs 10%; P 5 .0003). Arm A also demonstrated a trend toward more grade 3 or higher
anemia (19% vs 7%; P 5 .053) whereas patients in
Arm B (GV) tended to develop more grade 3 pneumonitis (7% vs 0%; P 5 .058). During the second-line
treatment, Arm A (IP with crossover to GV) featured
more grade 3 or higher neutropenia (78% vs 40%;
P 5 .0003). Likewise, for the patients on Arm B (GV
with crossover to IP), there was more grade 2 or 3
nausea and vomiting (40% vs 5% P<.0001) and alopecia (44% vs 24%; P 5 .047). In addition, second-line
IP chemotherapy yielded more grade 3 diarrhea (17%
vs 2%; P 5 .039). There were no treatment-related
deaths reported in either treatment arm.

DISCUSSION
At the current time, the standard platinum-based
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC may be challenged by modern nonplatinum-based chemotherapy
because of its better tolerability and similar effect on
survival. As more patients are treated upfront with

nonplatinum-based chemotherapy, platinum-based
doublets can be used in the second-line setting.17
Moreover, improved supportive care medications are
better able to control or prevent severe platinumrelated toxicities, which means that more patients
can be treated with platinum-based chemotherapy as
a second-line treatment. Currently, in patients with
progressive disease and a good PS after first-line
chemotherapy, second-line treatment with singleagent docetaxel or pemetrexed is recommended.18–20
However, the response rate to second-line chemotherapy, either docetaxel or pemetrexed, is reported
to be <10%. Previously, we conducted a phase 2
study of IP for patients with advanced NSCLC who
were previously treated with nonplatinum-based
chemotherapy.18–20 The response rate and median
survival time of the IP chemotherapy as a secondline treatment were 41% and 9.3 months, respectively. Although grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was the
most common toxicity, toxicity was manageable, and
50% of patients completed the planned 6 cycles of IP
chemotherapy. These results suggest that IP chemotherapy is active and well tolerated as a second-line
therapy for advanced NSCLC patients who are pretreated with nonplatinum-based chemotherapy.
Thereafter, we conduced the current randomized,
phase 2 study to compare the 2 opposite sequences
of chemotherapy: cisplatin-based followed by noncisplatin-based chemotherapy versus noncisplatinbased followed by cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We
found that the IP regimen demonstrated a favorable
trend with regard to tumor response rate and PFS,
particularly in the second-line setting, which resulted

394

CANCER

July 15, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 2

in no significant difference in OS between the opposite sequences of chemotherapy. These findings suggest that both treatment sequences appear to be
acceptable for the treatment of patients with
advanced NSCLC. With regard to toxicity, IP was
associated with more alopecia and nausea and
vomiting. In the second-line setting, IP was associated with more grade 3 diarrhea whereas GV was
associated with more grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. There
was no significant increase in the number of cases of
febrile neutropenia or treatment-related deaths
reported in the IP arm compared with the GV arm.
These results also confirm that IP can be safely
administered as well as the nonplatinum, GV regimen in both the first-line and second-line settings.
With regard to cross-resistance, it appears that
tumor responsiveness to a prior GV regimen had no
effect on the antitumor activity of IP in the secondline setting. Conversely, primary disease that was refractory to IP chemotherapy was found to significantly decrease tumor response to nonplatinum GV
chemotherapy and the majority of patients who were
primarily refractory to IP chemotherapy also failed to
respond to GV chemotherapy. The excision repair
cross-complementation Group 1 (ERCC1) enzyme
plays a central role in the nucleotide excision repair
pathway that recognizes and removes cisplatininduced DNA adducts.22,23 In a study of 783 individuals with completely resected NSCLC, patients with
ERCC1-negative tumors, but not those with ERCC1positive tumors, appeared to benefit from adjuvant
cisplatin-based chemotherapy and experienced prolonged PFS as well as OS. These results suggest that
ERCC1 expression levels are inversely associated with
the response and survival of patients treated with
cisplatin-based chemotherapy.24 Ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) is a key enzyme involved in
DNA synthesis, catalyzing the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from the corresponding ribonucleotides. It is the molecular target of gemcitabine and
reported data have indicated that higher levels of
RRM1 are associated with resistance to gemcitabine.25,26 Recently, Ceppi et al.27 reported that the
ERCC1 mRNA level is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with advanced NSCLC
who are treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.
They also found that the RRMI mRNA level is inversely associated with survival on univariate analysis.
However, the relevance of the RRMI level was hampered by its significantly high correlation with the
ERCC1 level (Rho 5 0.6; P < .0001). More recently,
Zheng et al.28 also demonstrated that RRMI expression is significantly correlated with ERCC1 expression
(Rho 5 0.3; P < .001). These findings suggest that

disease that is primarily refractory to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy may be associated with a high expression of ERCC1 that would be significantly correlated
with RRM1 expression and thereafter result in resistance to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Therefore,
patients with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy do not appear to be appropriate candidates
for gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Further research investigating the expression level of ERCC1
and RRMI in NSCLC is needed to clarify the cross-resistance between these 2 significant agents.
Recently, Fidias et al.29 reported on a study comparing immediate versus delayed second-line docetaxel therapy after 4 cycles of chemotherapy with
gemcitabine and carboplatin. The authors found that
immediate treatment was associated with a significant benefit in PFS and a favorable trend in OS. They
suggested that an immediate transition to secondline therapy may be optional in patients with NSCLC.
Therefore, it would be necessary to test whether this
finding would hold true for sequential therapy with
IP and GV.
In summary, the platinum-based IP regimen
appeared to be more effective in terms of response
rate in both the first-line and second-line settings.
However, given the similar OS and the better tolerability of the GV regimen, either treatment sequence
would appear to be acceptable for the treatment of
patients with advanced NSCLC. Further investigation
of the immediate transition to a sequential setting is
needed.
