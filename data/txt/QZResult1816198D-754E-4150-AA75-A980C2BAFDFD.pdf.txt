Abstract
Virtually all transcription factors partner with coactivators that recruit chromatin remodeling factors and
interact with the basal transcription machinery. Coactivators have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation,
invasion, and metastasis, including the p160 steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family composed of SRC-1
(NCOA1), SRC-2 (TIF2/GRIP1/NCOA2), and SRC-3 (AIB1/ACTR/NCOA3). Given their broad involvement in many
cancers, they represent candidate molecular targets for new chemotherapeutics. Here, we report on the results of
a high-throughput screening effort that identiﬁed the cardiac glycoside bufalin as a potent small-molecule
inhibitor for SRC-3 and SRC-1. Bufalin strongly promoted SRC-3 protein degradation and was able to block cancer
cell growth at nanomolar concentrations. When incorporated into a nanoparticle delivery system, bufalin was
able to reduce tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer. Our work identiﬁes bufalin as a
potentially broad-spectrum small-molecule inhibitor for cancer. Cancer Res; 74(5); 1506–17. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family comprises
three members, SRC-1 (NCOA1; ref. 1), SRC-2 (NCOA2; refs. 2,
3), and SRC-3 (NCOA3; refs. 4–7). Numerous studies have
established broad molecular and physiologic roles for the SRC
family in activating nuclear receptor–mediated gene expression (8). Besides nuclear receptors, they also coactivate other
transcriptional factors, including NF-kB (NFKB1)-, E2F1-, and
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)–dependent transcriptional
factors (9–11). The expansive roles that they play in mediating
gene expression is consistent with a breadth of studies pointing
to their regulation of diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic
processes, including cancers in which they are frequently
overexpressed (8).
Among the SRCs, SRC-3 has been the family member most
prominently linked to a wide variety of cancers. SRC-3 overexpression in the mouse mammary gland leads to spontaneous
tumor formation (12). In contrast, loss of SRC-3 suppressed
oncogene- and carcinogen-induced breast cancer initiation,
progression, and metastasis in mouse tumor models (13, 14). In
humans, SRC-3 gene ampliﬁcation has been found in 9.5%

breast cancers and the mRNA for SRC-3 is overexpressed 64%
of the time (4). Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that
overexpression of SRC-3 and SRC-1 is linked to resistance to
endocrine therapies in breast cancers. For instance, high
expression of SRC-3, especially conjunction with high levels
of EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2 (ERBB2), is associated with
poor outcome and recurrence after tamoxifen treatment (15).
In ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, overexpression of
SRC-3 also contributes to resistance against the ERBB2-targeting drug trastuzumab (Herceptin; ref. 16). SRC-3 overexpression has also been observed in a wide range of other cancers,
including ovarian (17), endometrial (18), prostate (19, 20), liver
(21), pancreatic (22), colorectal (23), and lung cancers (24).
SRC-1 has also been clearly implicated in cancer progression. In a mouse mammary tumor virus polyoma middle T
(MMTV-PyMT) model system, loss of SRC-1 markedly reduces
tumor cell metastasis (25). Consistent with this, elevated SRC-1
expression has been reported in approximately 20% of primary
human breast cancers, with higher expression positively correlating with disease recurrence and poor survival (26, 27). A
positive association between high SRC-1 expression and tumor
recurrence in patients with breast cancer who received tamoxifen therapy has also been reported (26, 27).
Considering the ability of SRC coactivators to activate
multiple growth factor signaling pathways that drive cancer
cell growth and promote resistance to endocrine therapy, SRC
small-molecule inhibitors (SMI) are anticipated to be effective
new agents to treat cancer. In an initial "proof-of-principle"
study, we recently showed that gossypol is able to inhibit SRC-3
and SRC-1 (28), demonstrating that these oncogenic coactivators are a class of accessible targets for SMI-based chemotherapy. This work established the feasibility for engaging in a
high-throughput compound library screen to identify more

effective SRC SMIs. As a result of these high-throughput
screens, here we describe the characterization of the cardiac
glycoside bufalin as potent SRC SMI that is able to effectively
reduce SRC-3 and SRC-1 cellular protein concentration and
block cancer cell growth in cell culture and animal models.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
For high-throughput screening, an MLSMR library was
provided by Evotec through the Roadmap Molecular Libraries
Initiative of the NIH. Details about compound selection for this
library can be found online (29). Digoxin, bufalin, ouabain, and
digitoxin were obtained from Sigma and dissolved in ethanol.
Cinobufagin, cinobufotalin, cycloheximide, and MG132 were
obtained from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Strophanthidin and resibufogenin were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and dissolved in ethanol and
DMSO, respectively. MK-2206 was purchased from SelleckChem and dissolved in DMSO. Antibodies to SRC-1, SRC-3, and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were

purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to
CARM1 and SRC-2 were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories.
Cell culture
Human cancer cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell lines were maintained
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM; HeLa; MCF7) and RPMI-1640 (A549) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin (100 U/mL),
unless otherwise indicated. All cells were cultured at 37 C
under 5% CO2. All cells were used within 6 months from the
time when they were obtained from ATCC, expanded, and
resuscitated except for MDA-MB-231-LM3.3, which were
veriﬁed to be derived from MB-MBA-231 cells by short
tandem repeat DNA proﬁling before use in xenograft animal
model experiments.
Plasmids and transfections
The expression vectors for the GAL4-responsive luciferase
reporter pG5-LUC and Gal4 DBD fusion proteins with SRC-1,
SRC-2, and SRC-3 were described previously (30). Twenty-four

incubated with indicated antibodies as previously described
(28). All experiments were repeated at least three times.
Intensities of the bands of interest in the Western blot analysis
were quantitated using ImageJ software (31).

Cell extraction and assays
For luciferase assays, collected cell pellets after treatments
were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activities were normalized against Renilla luciferase activities
according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega).
For Western blotting, cells were harvested and lysed in lysis
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40)
and then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 21,000  g at 4 C. After
the total cellular protein concentration was determined by
Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad), protein lysates were resolved by
SDS-7.5% PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride

1,536-well plate SRC-1 and SRC-3 HTS assays
A detailed protocol for the high throughput screening (HTS)
assay can be found on the PubChem Bioassay website (32).
Quantitative PCR analysis
MCF-7 cell total RNAs were isolated from 12-well culture
dishes using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The mRNAs for
SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, and GAPDH were quantitated by TaqMan-based reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using the ABI

was used along with Universal Roche Probe #60. RT-PCR was
performed using 1 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). All mRNA quantities were normalized
against GAPDH RNA and experiments were repeated two
times.
Fluorescence spectrometry
The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of different portions of SRC-3 were expressed and puriﬁed as
described previously (33). Fluorescence spectrometric measurements were performed using an SLM 48000S ﬂuorescence
spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco) and an Agilent Cary Eclipse
Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).
A total of 1.5 mmol/L of GST SRC-3 receptor-interacting
domain (RID), CBP-interacting domain (CID), or basic helix–
loop–helix (bHLH) was placed in a ﬂuorescence cuvette and
excited with UV light at a wavelength of 278 nm with a 2-nm
bandwidth, and the emission spectra were recorded from 295
nm to more than 400 nm with a bandwidth of 4 nm. The aliquot
size of test compound was maintained below 5% of the total
sample volume to minimize the effects of dilution.

(Promega) after compound treatment. IC50 values were determined using the Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Bufalin PLGA nanoparticles
A block copolymer of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and
polyethylene glycol (PEG) was chosen as a nanocarrier material. PLGA–PEG was synthesized and bufalin-containing nanoparticles were produced using a nanoprecipitation method.
Speciﬁcally, a mixture of bufalin and PLGA–PEG in triﬂuoroethanol (TFE) was dripped into water under constant stirring.
The formed bufalin nanoparticles were veriﬁed for proper
formation by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission
electron micrography (TEM). The amount of drug encapsulated in nanoparticles was determined to be 1% by weight using
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by
detection of absorption at a wavelength of 210 nm.

SRC-1 (PubChem AID:588354; Fig. 1). Here, compounds were
evaluated by measuring luciferase expression from cells transiently transfected with a GAL4 responsive luciferase reporter
(pG5-LUC) and an expression vector for either a GAL4 DNAbinding (DBD) SRC-3 or GAL4 DBD SRC-1 fusion protein (30).
Compounds that inhibited luciferase gene expression greater
than 3s over DMSO were counted as SMI hits. In this primary

Of note, 36 mmol/L gossypol was used as a positive control, which
was able to elicit 100% inhibition. On the basis of a 3-s cutoff,
620 (0.17%) compounds were able to inhibit SRC-3 and 428

inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Left, cells were treated with different doses (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 nmol/L, 1, and 2 mmol/L) of
digoxin for 24 hours, and then cell viability was determined by MTS assays. Collected data were normalized to the vehicle-treated control. Each data
point represent the average of relative values derived from three wells of digoxin-treated cells at the indicated dose. Nonlinear regression was used to
determine the point of 50% inhibition for cell viability (IC50). Right, relative SRC-3 protein levels after digoxin (0.5, 1, and 2 mmol/L) treatment
compared with the vehicle control (derived from Western blotting data in Fig. 4) are shown as the dashed line. B and C, bufalin reduced A549 (B) and
MCF-7 (C) cell viabilities in accordance with SRC-3 protein degradation with increasing doses. Left, the dose responses for cell viabilities upon
bufalin treatment (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 nmol/L) were analyzed as described above. Right, relative SRC-3 protein content
after bufalin treatment (0, 1, 2, and 5 nmol/L) in A549 cells (derived from blotting shown in Fig. 4) and treatment (0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 nmol/L) in
MCF-7 cells is shown as the dashed line. D, knockout of the SRC-3 protein attenuates the inhibitory effects of bufalin on cell viability. HeLa parental
and SRC-3 knockout cells (SRC-3KO) were treated with bufalin at different doses (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 nmol/L)
for 24 hours and cell viability was determined by MTS assay. HeLa parental cells are shown as the dashed line and the SRC-3KO cells are shown as
the solid line.

compounds were then tested in the conﬁrmatory screen in the
same manner as the primary screen in quadruplicate and in a
counter screen using cells transfected with an expression vector

Bufalin Is a Steroid Receptor Coactivator Inhibitor

Structure–activity cluster analyses identify cardiac
glycosides as a functional group of SRC-3 and SRC-1 SMIs
Active compounds retrieved from the primary screens were
clustered according to the structural similarities in PubChem
(data not shown). The biggest cluster contains 25 compounds,
sharing a common steroid nucleus, the majority of which
contain a lactone moiety characteristic of cardiac glycosides
(35). Cardiac glycosides are known to inhibit the Naþ/Kþ
ATPase in cardiac myocytes, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca2þ and stronger myocardial contraction (36). Interestingly, numerous epidemiologic studies revealed that patients taking cardiac glycosides have either better outcome or
lower risk for various cancers, including breast cancers (37, 38),
leukemia/lymphoma (39), and prostate cancer (40), although
the mechanism has hitherto been unknown.
Evaluation of cardiac glycoside family members for their
efﬁcacy as SRC SMIs
Because a cluster of cardiac glycoside series was identiﬁed as
active compounds in our high-throughput screens, we sought
to evaluate a panel of cardiac glycosides to identify which were
most potent as SRC SMIs. We examined SRC-3 protein concentrations in MCF-7 cells treated for 24 hours with cardiac
glycosides, including ouabain, digitoxin, strophanthidin, cinobufagin, cinobufotalin, and resibufogenin. All tested compounds downregulated cellular SRC-3 protein levels, but at
varying doses (Fig. 2). Ouabain and digitoxin seemed to be
more effective than digoxin, while bufalin was found to be the
most potent of all. In comparison, strophanthidin also reduced
SRC-3 protein, but at a higher dose than digoxin. Bufalin was
the most potent bufadienolide, followed (in order) by cinobufagin, cinobufotalin, and resibufogenin.
Inhibition of SRC-3 and SRC-1 by digoxin and bufalin
Next, we chose to investigate the effects of cardiac glycosides
on the intrinsic transcriptional activities of SRC coactivators.
HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a pGL5-LUC reporter and expression vectors for pBIND, pBIND-SRC-1, -SRC-2, or
-SRC-3, followed by 24 hours of treatment with the plant-based
cardiac glycoside digoxin or the toad cardiac glycoside bufalin.
Digoxin reduced luciferase reporter activities in cells transfected
with pBIND-SRC-1 and pBIND-SRC-3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
reporter activities driven by the GAL4 DBD alone were only
slightly affected (pBIND, inset to the right). Similarly, administration of bufalin led to a signiﬁcant decrease in pBIND-SRC-1
and pBIND-SRC-3 activities in a dose-dependent manner, while
only minimally affecting the activity of pBIND (GAL4 DBD
alone) and inﬂuencing pBIND-SRC-2 less strongly (Fig. 3B).
This result suggests that both digoxin and bufalin preferentially
inhibit the intrinsic transcriptional activities of SRC-3 and SRC1, while inhibiting SRC-2 to a lesser extent.

Effects of digoxin and bufalin on cellular protein
concentrations of SRCs and other coactivators
Because the steady-state levels of coactivator proteins have
been shown to correlate with their transcriptional activities
and with cancer progression (33), we sought to examine the
effects of digoxin and bufalin on SRC protein levels in MCF-7
breast and A549 lung cancer cells after 24 hours of incubation.
As shown in Fig. 4A–C, SRC-3 and SRC-1 protein levels were
signiﬁcantly reduced by both digoxin and bufalin in a dosedependent manner, suggesting that the loss in SRC-3 and SRC1 intrinsic activities seen above is due to the reduced cellular
concentration of either coactivator. In agreement with the
ﬁnding that SRC-2 activities are less strongly affected, both
digoxin and bufalin have more modest effects on the cellular
level of the SRC-2 protein. We then investigated the steadystate level of CARM1 that has been shown to exist in a multiprotein coactivator complex along with SRC-3 (41). In contrast
to the noticeable decrease in SRC-3 protein level, CARM1
protein level is not altered after treatment in A549 cells, but
was reduced moderately in MCF-7 cells.
Digoxin and bufalin inhibit cancer cell proliferation
Next, we assessed the effects of digoxin and bufalin on
cancer cell proliferation. First, MTS assays were performed
on MCF-7 cells treated with digoxin at different doses for 24
hours. This revealed that digoxin can block MCF-7 cell growth
with IC50 of about 500 nmol/L (Fig. 5A, left), in line with the
dose of digoxin required to reduce SRC-3 protein levels in the
cell (Fig. 5A, right). In contrast, the IC50 of bufalin in MCF-7 and
A549 cells were below 5 nmol/L in either cell lines (Fig. 5B and
C, left). Again, the dose of bufalin required to block cancer cell
proliferation corresponds with the concentration required to
cause downregulation of the SRC-3 protein (Fig. 5B and C,
right). Differential dependence of distinct cell types toward
each of the three SRCs could account for the differences in
bufalin effect on cell viability and SRC-3 cellular protein
concentration. Importantly, the concentrations of bufalin
required to kill cancer cells tested here are less than the
reported human maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of 8.75
nmol/L (42), pointing to its potential clinical use as an anticancer agent. For this reason, we chose to focus on bufalin for
further characterization as an SRC SMI.
Accumulating evidence has shown that targeting SRC-3
expression impairs cancer cell growth in multiple cancer types
(8). Given the fact that the decreased cell viability induced by
bufalin is accompanied by reduced SRC-3 protein levels, we
sought to investigate the speciﬁc role of the SRC-3 protein in
blocking cancer cell proliferation. To do this, we used a zinc
ﬁnger nuclease (ZFN) to knockout both SRC-3 alleles in the
HeLa cell line (SRC-3KO cells). It was difﬁcult to obtain viable
SRC-3KO cells initially; however, we noted that after 2 months,

(Continued.) MCF-7 cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 200 mg/mL) and bufalin (50 nmol/L), individually or simultaneously, and then harvested at 0,
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 hours thereafter and visualized by Western blot analysis. C, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevents SRC-3 protein
downregulation induced by bufalin. MCF-7 were changed to medium supplemented with 0.5% stripped FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 U/mL)
overnight, and then incubated with bufalin (0, 1, 3, and 5 nmol/L) in the absence or presence of 5 mmol/L MG132 for 24 hours. Cell extracts were collected and
analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against SRC-3 and GAPDH. D, bufalin directly binds to the RID of SRC-3. Intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence
emission spectra of SRC-3 RID (lex ¼ 278 nm) were quenched and redshifted with increasing concentrations of bufalin.

they proliferated at a rate comparable with wild-type (WT)
cells, likely after adapting genetically to the loss of SRC-3. As
shown in Fig. 5D, SRC-3 protein is abolished in these SRC-3KO
knockout cells. Compared with parental SRC-3þ/þ cells, the
response of SRC-3KO cells to bufalin administration is blunted.
This ﬁnding supports the idea that SRC-3 protein is involved in
mediating the cell response to bufalin treatment. However, the
remaining response of SRC-3KO cells to bufalin, including the
lack of an increase in the effective concentration required for
these cells to respond to treatment, is likely due to the SRC-1
and SRC-2 that continues to be expressed in these cells and that
also responds to bufalin at a similar dose as SRC-3, in addition
to any unknown off-target actions of the compound.
Bufalin promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of
SRC-3 and binds directly to the coactivator
To gain insights into the mechanism of bufalin-mediated
SRC-3 protein downregulation, we assessed whether 24 hours
of bufalin treatment affected the production of mRNAs for each
SRC family member in MCF-7 cells. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
revealed that mRNA levels for SRC-1 and SRC-2 were not
signiﬁcantly altered, whereas the mRNA levels for SRC-3 were
actually increased upon bufalin incubation (Fig. 6A). This
result suggested that bufalin reduces SRC-3 and SRC-1 protein
levels posttranscriptionally.
To further investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for bufalin-mediated SRC-3 protein downregulation, we
compared the turnover rates of the SRC-3 protein in MCF-7
cells between vehicle and bufalin treatment in the presence of
the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Cells were treated with cycloheximide and bufalin, individually or simultaneously, and then harvested at the indicated time points for
Western blot analysis. In line with a previous report (43), SRC-3
decays with a 4-hour half-life (Fig. 6B). The addition of bufalin
accelerated the rate of SRC-3 turnover, indicating that bufalin
promotes degradation of the SRC-3 protein.
Our laboratory has previously shown that all SRC coactivators are targets of the proteasome, as evidenced by the observation that treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
increases their protein levels (30). When we examined the
effects of concomitant treatment with MG132 and bufalin
ranging from 1 to 5 nmol/L on SRC-3 protein levels in MCF7 cells (Fig. 6C), MG132 treatment alone was able to strongly
elevate the SRC-3 protein levels, consistent with that previously
reported. The reduction in SRC-3 protein level induced by
bufalin treatment was blocked by MG132, leading to protein
levels up to a point comparable with cells treated with MG132
alone.
Next, we sought to determine whether bufalin promoted
SRC-3 protein degradation through physical interaction with
the SRC-3 protein. Through ﬂuorescence shift analysis of SRC-3
protein fragments, bufalin was found to quench the intrinsic
ﬂuorescence and shift the emission maximum of the RID of
SRC-3 (Fig. 6D), indicating that bufalin binds directly to the RID
of SRC-3. In contrast, there are no changes in the intrinsic
ﬂuorescence observed for the CID or the bHLH domain of SRC3 upon the addition of bufalin (data not shown), which
mitigates the possibility that the ﬂuorescence changes seen

1514

Cancer Res; 74(5) March 1, 2014

for the RID fragment are due to nonspeciﬁc interactions with
bufalin. Because of the high afﬁnity of bufalin binding to the
SRC-3 RID, it is difﬁcult to precisely determine its afﬁnity;
however, binding was detected even with 5 nmol/L of bufalin,
consistent with its potency in cell culture experiments.
Bufalin sensitizes cancer cells to other targeted
therapeutics
Accumulating evidence shows that SRC coactivators sit at a
nexus linking diverse growth signaling cascades (see Introduction). This role for SRCs supports the notion that an SRC SMI
such as bufalin should break cross-talk between different
growth factor pathways, attenuating their ability to signal to
downstream pathway components responsible for enacting
cellular transcriptional programs that drive cell proliferation,
invasion, and metastasis. SRC-3 has been shown to activate
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling (44), and we wanted to ask whether the inhibitory effects of an AKT inhibitor on cell viability
could be enhanced by cotreatment with bufalin. To test this, we
treated A549 cells with a low dose of bufalin in combination
with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206. As shown in Fig. 7A, combined treatment with bufalin and MK-2206 exhibited a
markedly higher ability to block A549 cell proliferation than
either with agent alone.
A bufalin nanoparticle formation can block tumor cell
growth in a xenograft model
Bufalin is an excellent candidate for incorporation into a
nanoparticle-based delivery system because it can speciﬁcally
kill cancer cells (IC50, 3–5 nmol/L) without observable toxicity
in nontransformed TM4 Sertoli cells at doses up to 10 mmol/L
(Fig. 7B) or primary hepatocytes even at doses as high as 300
nmol/L (data not shown), but it possesses signiﬁcant cardiotoxicity—a fact we substantiated in our own animal studies
with free bufalin (data not shown), and it has a short in vivo
half-life. With "free bufalin," we observed a response in metastatic tumor lesions using an in vivo model described below,
but we were unable to achieve a satisfactory response in
primary tumors, possibly due to dose-limiting toxicities or
due to inadequate drug penetration into larger tumors (data
not shown). Already, a wheat germ agglutinin–grafted lipid
bufalin nanoparticle has been developed to allow for its oral
delivery and improve its stability (45). Another formulation
consists of a methoxy PEG, PLGA, poly-L-lysine, and cyclic
arginine-glycine-aspartic acid carrier loaded with bufalin that
has been shown to possess a favorable biodistribution proﬁle
and has antitumor activity in vivo (45). Here, we chose to test a
similar and established PEG-PLGA–based nanoparticle delivery system (see Materials and Methods; ref. 46) that has already
been successfully used to produce doxorubicin PEG–PLGA
nanoparticles that have been designed to avoid distribution to
cardiac tissue.
Fox Chase SCID Beige mice were injected with 750,000 MDAMB-231–derived LM3.3 cells into the second mammary gland

injection, mice were separated into three groups and given the
following treatments: (i) PBS vehicle control–treated (n ¼ 5);
(ii) bufalin nanoparticle (1.5 mg/kg)–treated (n ¼ 10); and (iii)

tumor volume was measured to assess the ability of the bufalin
nanoparticle to inhibit tumor growth (Fig. 7C). Aggressive
tumor growth was observed in the PBS- and blank nanoparticle-treated control mice, whereas the bufalin nanoparticletreated mice showed a signiﬁcant inhibition in the rate of
tumor growth 4 days after initial treatment that was sustained
throughout the experiment.

Discussion
The SRC family has been widely implicated in carcinogenesis, providing a strong impetus to develop SRC SMIs as novel
and effective therapeutic agents. Using a luminescence-based
assay to assess coactivator intrinsic transcriptional activities,

www.aacrjournals.org

we conducted a high-throughput screen of an MLPCN compound library (34) to identify SRC-3 and SRC-1 SMI hits.
Because of the large size of this library, we were able to gain
insight into the comparative activities of many structurally
related compounds, revealing cardiac glycosides as the largest
class of compounds with SRC SMI activities. Our data demonstrate that both digoxin and bufalin selectively reduced
intrinsic activities of SRC-3 and SRC-1, consistent with that
observed in the primary screen. Marked differences in the
potencies of cardiac glycosides were observed, with most
inhibiting SRCs at concentrations higher than their MTD.
However, bufalin was found to have better potency and inhibited SRCs at concentrations below its MTD of 8.75 nmol/L,
leading to our focus on it as a potentially clinically useful SRC
SMI.
For centuries, cardiac glycosides have been used to treat
patients with edematous states, irregular heartbeats, or chronic heart failure, and epidemiologic evidence has shown that
patients who take cardiac glycosides are at lower risk for
various cancers, pointing to their potential as cancer therapeutic agents (47). Interestingly, cardiac glycosides have also
been shown to inhibit the androgen receptor, but were found
not to bind to the receptor itself (48).
Despite their anticancer properties, the effectiveness of
cardiac glycosides is limited by their narrow therapeutic
window. For example, the nontoxic plasma concentration of
digoxin for cardiac disease patients is 2.6 nmol/L or less
(49). In our study, the concentration of digoxin required to
inhibit SRC-3/SRC-1 is greater than 200 nmol/L. In contrast,
we show here that bufalin is effective at a low nanomolar
range (3–5 nmol/L), which is within the concentration
range observed in patient plasma in which no cardiac
toxicity was observed (9 nmol/L; ref. 42). Given the
enhanced effectiveness when combined with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206, bufalin's ability to block tumor growth might
be achievable at even lower doses. Another approach we
pursued to avoid the dose-limiting toxicity associated with
bufalin toward the heart was to deliver bufalin in a PEG–
PLGA delivery particle, in which we were able to effectively
block breast tumor growth in vivo. Bufalin has already been
tested in several small clinical trials (42) and the data
presented here that characterize it as an SRC SMI provide
new insight into its mechanism of action. Results presented
here demonstrating that SRC-3 and SRC-1 are targets of
bufalin promise to more rationally guide its future use as a
novel therapeutic agent.
