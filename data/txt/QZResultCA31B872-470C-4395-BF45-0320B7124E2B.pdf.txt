Abstract

Introduction

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway mediates proliferation,
survival, and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) cells.
Here, we tested the anti-MM activity of NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235),
which inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling at the levels of PI3K
and mTOR. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric survival assays showed that MM
cell lines exhibited dose- and time-dependent decreased
viability after exposure to BEZ235 (IC50, 25–800 nmol/L for
48 hours). MM cells highly sensitive (IC50, <25 nmol/L) to
BEZ235 (e.g., MM.1S, MM.1R, Dox40, and KMS-12-PE) included
both lines sensitive and resistant to conventional (dexamethasone, cytotoxic chemotherapeutics) agents. Pharmacologically relevant BEZ235 concentrations (25–400 nmol/L)
induced rapid commitment to and induction of MM.1S and
OPM-2 cell death. Furthermore, normal donor peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were less sensitive (IC50, >800 nmol/L)
than the majority of MM cell lines tested, suggesting a
favorable therapeutic index. In addition, BEZ235 was able to
target MM cells in the presence of exogenous interleukin-6,
insulin-like growth factor-1, stromal cells, or osteoclasts,
which are known to protect against various anti-MM agents.
Molecular profiling revealed that BEZ235 treatment decreased
the amplitude of transcriptional signatures previously associated with myc, ribosome, and proteasome function, as well as
high-risk MM and undifferentiated human embryonic stem
cells. In vivo xenograft studies revealed significant reduction in
tumor burden (P = 0.011) and survival (P = 0.028) in BEZ235treated human MM tumor-bearing mice. Combinations of
BEZ235 with conventional (e.g., dexamethasone and doxorubicin) or novel (e.g., bortezomib) anti-MM agents showed lack
of antagonism. These results indicate that BEZ235 merits
clinical testing, alone and in combination with other agents, in
MM. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5835–42]

Multiple myeloma (MM) has pathophysiologic features distinct
from other cancers (1); however, many of the molecular pathways
that result in growth and survival of MM cells are also implicated
in many other cancers (2). Targeting one such pathway, the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, may provide profound antitumor
effects both in MM and other tumor types. This cascade represents
an important target in MM because major growth factors, such as
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6),
activate PI3K and its downstream targets Akt and mTOR to
stimulate proliferation, survival, and drug resistance of MM cells
(3–5). Because of its complexity and extensive cross-talk with other
cascades, therapeutic targeting of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway at
multiple molecular levels may provide better antitumor effects than
selective inhibition of only one component of the pathway.
Targeting the PI3K pathway at multiple levels may prevent the
development of drug resistance.
In this study, we examined the effects of the small molecular
mass inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235), which inhibits the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling axis at the levels of both PI3K and mTOR. This
dual inhibitor has been shown to have activity in multiple tumor
types. It was first documented to be an orally bioavailable inhibitor
active in PC3M prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, which
targets the p110 isoforms at low nanomolar levels (6). Further
studies showed that BEZ235 inhibited vascular endothelial growth
factor–induced endothelial cell proliferation both in vitro and
in vivo and has activity in BT474 breast cancer cells harboring
HER2 amplification (7). In addition, cell lines harboring K-Ras and
B-Raf mutations tend to be less sensitive to BEZ235 but remain
responsive to nanomolar levels of the drug (8).
Due to the activity of BEZ235 in solid tumors and the
dependence on the PI3K signaling in MM, we explored the
potential anti-MM activity of BEZ235 in our preclinical models. We
observed a distinct pattern of activity of BEZ235 compared with
other anti-MM agents. Specifically, we observed a dose- and timedependent decrease of MM cell viability in vitro on exposure to
pharmacologically relevant concentrations of BEZ235, with activity
against MM cell lines sensitive and resistant to conventional or
novel anti-MM agents. Rapid commitment of MM.1S and OPM-2
cells to death was triggered by BEZ235. Importantly, normal donor
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were less sensitive
than the overwhelming majority of MM cell lines tested, suggesting
a favorable therapeutic index. Combinations of BEZ235 with
conventional (e.g., dexamethasone and doxorubicin) or novel (e.g.,

bortezomib) anti-MM agents showed additive activity, indicating
that these BEZ235-based combinations can be feasible in clinical
settings. These results provide the framework for clinical trials of
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 to improve patient outcome
in MM.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. We evaluated a panel of human MM cell lines (ARK, Delta 47,
Dox40, JJN3, KMS-5, KMS-11, KMS-12-BM, KMS-12-PE, KMS-28-BM, KMS28-PE, KMS-34, MM.1R, MM.1S, MR20, NCI-H929, OCI-MY5, OPM-2, OPM-6,
S6B45, U266, and XG1) as well as the human immortalized bone marrow
stromal cell (BMSC) line HS-5 and the immortalized hepatocyte cell line
THLE-3. In addition, MM.1S-myrAkt and MM.1S-Bcl-2 cells were established
by stable transfection of MM.1S cells with constructs encoding for
constitutively active myristoylated Akt and for Bcl-2, respectively (9).
Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) with 100 units/mL penicillin,
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 10% FCS (Life Technologies).
Compounds and reagents. BEZ235 (CAS 915019-65-7, C30H23N5O,
molecular weight 469.55) was synthesized and provided by Novartis AG.
Dexamethasone and doxorubicin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
PS-341 (bortezomib) was synthesized and provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. LY294002 was purchased from Sigma and used at concentrations
indicated. Rapamycin was purchased from Calbiochem and used at
concentrations indicated. Recombinant human IL-6 and IGF (R&D Systems)
were used at 10 and 50 ng/mL, respectively, in cultures of MM.1S cells.
Cell viability assessment. For the panel of MM cell lines (details
described in Supplementary Data), THLE-3 hepatocytes, and HS-5 stromal
cells, cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Chemicon International) colorimetric
survival assay, as previously published (10). Cell lines were treated in
48-well plates at a density of 20,000 per well for 48 h in a 37jC incubator
with 5% CO2. Peripheral blood samples from healthy donors were collected
using heparinized tubes and processed by Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences)
density gradient centrifugation to isolate PBMCs. Cells were plated at
150,000 per well and stimulated with 5 Ag/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h before exposure to BEZ235 for 48 h. Viability was
accessed by MTT assays, as described above. For patient samples, bone
marrow aspirates from MM patients were collected, and PBMCs were
separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and selected using CD138
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified CD138+ patient cells were plated at a
density of 10,000 per well and treated for 48 h, and viability was measured
using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). Combination studies were
performed in cell lines and doses described in the figure legend, and
viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay.
Cell death commitment assay. The minimum exposure of MM cells to
BEZ235 that is required to commit them to death was evaluated by
incubating cells in 24-well plates with BEZ235 (100 nmol/L) for 0 to 24 h.
Following incubation, the cells were washed with drug-free medium to
remove any residual drug and then incubated in drug-free medium for an
additional 3 d, resulting in equal length of incubation for all experimental
conditions. MM cell survival was quantified by MTT and expressed as
percentage of the value obtained from respective controls.
Stromal cell coculture. The luciferase (luc)–expressing MM.1S-GFP/luc
and OPM2-GFP/luc cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction with
the pGC-gfp/luc vector (kind gift of C.G. Fathman, Stanford University,
Stanford, CA) and used for coculture experiments with the luc-negative
human stromal line HS-5 (11). Using the compartment-specific bioluminescence imaging (CS-BLI) technique (11), HS-5 stromal cells were plated in
96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. MM cells were then added
and treated with BEZ235 for 48 h at the doses indicated. Following
incubation, luciferin substrate (Xenogen Corp.) was added to the culture,
and the resulting bioluminescence signal was measured using a Luminoskan luminometer (Labsystems).
Osteoclast differentiation/coculture. PBMCs were isolated as described above and cultured in a-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

(FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin for 16 h to allow attachment.
Nonadherent cells were removed, fresh media supplemented with MCSF
(25 ng/mL; R&D Systems) and RANKL (50 ng/mL; PeproTech) were added,
and cells were cultured for 3 to 4 wk to differentiate mature osteoclasts.
Using the CS-BLI technique (11), mature osteoclasts were plated in 96-well
plates, allowed to attach overnight, and used in coculture experiments with
MM cells.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle. MM.1S cells
were treated with 100 nmol/L BEZ235 for 0 to 48 h. For evaluation of
apoptosis, cells were processed using an Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)
kit (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). For cell cycle analyses, cells were
stained using a solution of PI (Sigma) and RNase A (Sigma) following 70%
ethanol fixation. Data were collected using a Beckman Coulter flow
cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo analysis software (TreeStar).
Immunoblotting analysis. For immunoblotting analyses, parental
MM.1S, MM.1S-myrAkt, and MM.1S-Bcl-2 cells (10  106 per condition)
were plated in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin.
BEZ235 (100 nmol/L) was added for 0 to 48 h and immunoblotting was
performed with primary antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Upstate Biotechnology, or Cell Signaling. Secondary antibodies were
purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Immunofluorescence staining procedures. U20S cells were treated in
the presence and absence of 250 nmol/L BEZ235 for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Cells
were fixed and stained for expression of FITC-Foxo3a (Becton Dickinson)
and Hoechst (Invitrogen). Staining was imaged using Eclipse E800
microscope (Nikon) and MetaVue (Molecular Devices) software and
analyzed using Design Standard CS3 (Adobe) software.
Gene expression profiling of cells treated with BEZ235. Total RNA
extraction and purification, cDNA synthesis and cRNA labeling, as well as
Affymetrix chip (human HT-U133A and HT-U133B) hybridization and data
analysis were performed as previously described (9, 12). Briefly, MM.1S
cells were treated with 100 nmol/L BEZ235 or with DMSO for 2, 4, 8, 16,
and 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and purified, cDNA synthesized, and
cRNA labeled before hybridization to the HT-U133A and HT-U133B arrays.
For each time point of the analysis, gene expression profile of BEZ235treated MM.1S cells was compared with profile of MM.1S cells cultured in
the absence of the drug; filtering of up-regulated or down-regulated
transcripts was based on conventional criteria for statistical significance
incorporated in the software (9, 12–14). Transcripts previously shown to
reflect the activation state of pathways pertinent to tumor cell
proliferation, survival, drug resistance, and other functional end points
of tumor cell biology were evaluated in respect to their differences in
expression between BEZ235-treated versus control MM.1S cells for each of
the time points of the analysis. For this analysis, we focused on a
compendium of signatures previously determined to reflect: ribosomal and
proteasome pathways [as included in the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) database4 and refs. 15, 16]; signatures of self-renewal implicated in
normal and/or cancer stem cell biology, including myc (17, 18), hTERT
(19), Hedgehog (20), and Notch (21), a transcriptional signature of genes
up-regulated in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (22), and a
signature of genes enriched in mouse embryonic neural and hematopoietic stem cells and considered to define a genetic program for stem cells
(as included in the GSEA database; ref. 23); and the HT-U133A and
HT-U133B probes corresponding to the IRF4 target genes identified by
Shaffer and colleagues (24). We also studied a transcriptional signature of
genes down-regulated by p53 function (as identified with the use of
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; ref. 25); a transcriptional signature previously
reported to correlate with unfavorable clinical prognosis of MM patients
(26); and a signature of genes overexpressed in angiogenic versus nonangiogenic tumors, as identified by Hu and colleagues (27). The probes
corresponding to each of these signatures were used to filter the data set
(either using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software or Microsoft Excel) and
the outputs were processed to calculate the average value (F95% confidence

limit) of the difference in absolute expression signal in MM cells cultured in
the presence versus absence of BEZ235.
In vivo antitumor activity of BEZ235. MM.1S-GFP/luc cells (106 per
mouse) were injected s.c. into g-irradiated (150 rads) nude mice. After
tumor engraftment, mice were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg/kg
BEZ235 or vehicle orally. Mice were monitored regularly for changes in
tumor size (by calipers), changes in body weight, and signs of infection or
paralysis. Mice were treated, monitored, and sacrificed in accordance with
approved protocol of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and
Use Committee. Overall survival (defined as time between initiation of
treatment and sacrifice or death) was compared in control versus BEZ235treated mice by Kaplan-Meier method.

Results
Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR in MM cells in vitro.
The synergistic activity of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in
combination with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Supplementary
Fig. S1) supports the notion that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, such
as BEZ235, may have potent activity in MM. We therefore tested a
panel of MM tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A) with BEZ235 (0–800 nmol/L)
for 48 hours and evaluated tumor cell viability using MTT

colorimetric survival assays. The majority of MM cell lines had
IC50 values <50 nmol/L (Fig. 1A), which were lower than in a select
panel of non-MM cell lines (data not shown). MM.1S cells exhibited
the lowest IC50 value (<25 nmol/L), with comparably high
sensitivity with BEZ235 in JJN3, MM.1R, ARK, and Dox40 cell lines.
MM patient tumor cells were collected from bone marrow
aspirates and isolated using CD138 selection by Miltenyi microbeads and their viability was assessed. BEZ235 induced cytotoxicity in
three of five MM patient samples, with IC50 values <200 nmol/L
(Fig. 1B).
We next evaluated the effect of BEZ235 on PBMCs, the stromal
cell line HS-5, and the immortalized hepatocyte cell line THLE-3.
HS-5 BMSCs were insensitive to BEZ235 at concentrations up to
800 nmol/L (Fig. 1C), with IC50 higher than the majority of MM cell
lines. Similarly, THLE-3 cells had an IC50 >800 nmol/L (Fig. 1C).
PBMCs from healthy donors also remained viable when exposed to
BEZ235 for 48 hours at concentrations as high as 800 nmol/L
(Fig. 1D). Furthermore, PBMCs stimulated with PHA (5 ng/mL) for
24 hours and treated for an additional 48 hours with BEZ235
remained z50% viable even at concentrations of BEZ235 as high as
800 nmol/L (Fig. 1D), suggesting a favorable therapeutic index.

Figure 1. Activity of BEZ235 on MM cells. A, a panel of MM cell lines was treated with BEZ235 (at 0–800 nmol/L) for a period of 48 h, and viability was assessed by
MTT assay. The most sensitive cell lines (MM.1S, JJN3, and MM.1R) have IC50 values <25 nmol/L, whereas the less sensitive MM cell lines (MR20, KMS-28-BM,
XG1, and KMS-28-PE) have IC50 values >800 nmol/L. B, bone marrow aspirates from MM patients were processed using Miltenyi anti-CD138 microbeads for
purification of MM cells. Viability of MM cells treated with or without increasing doses of BEZ235 for 48 h was assessed. C, nonmalignant cells were also
treated with BEZ235, and their viability was assessed by MTT assay. The BMSC line HS-5 and the immortalized hepatocyte cell line THLE-3 were exposed to BEZ235
(0–800 nmol/L) for 48 h and compared with the MM cell line MM.1S. IC50 values for HS-5 and THLE-3 were >800 nmol/L. D, in addition, both unstimulated and
PHA (5 ng/mL)–stimulated PBMCs were exposed to BEZ235 (0–800 nmol/L) for 48 h, and their viability was assessed by MTT. Due to cell stimulation, there was an
increase in viable PBMCs following 48 h in the absence of the drug; cells remained >50% viable at drug concentrations up to 800 nmol/L. Values were normalized
to the nonstimulated drug-free control.

MM cells were analyzed for their commitment to death following
exposure to BEZ235. After exposure to 100 nmol/L BEZ235 for 2
to 24 hours, cells were washed and cultured in drug-free medium
for an additional 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT
assay and compared with control cells without drug. MM.1S cells
require less than 24 hours of exposure to commit themselves to
>50% decease in viable cell numbers (Supplementary Fig. S2). In
contrast, one of the most resistant cell lines (MR20) and an
intermediately sensitive cell line (OPM2) require more than
24 hours of exposure to commit cells to death (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
BEZ235 overcomes stromal-derived, osteoclast-derived, and
cytokine protection of MM cells. To assess the effect of stromal
cells on the activity of BEZ235, MM.1S-GFP/luc MM cells were
treated with BEZ235 in the presence or absence of HS-5 stromal
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B) or differentiated osteoclasts
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and D), and the viability was assessed by
CS-BLI. The sensitivity of MM.1S (Supplementary Fig. S3A) or
OPM-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3B) cells was unaffected by coculture
with BMSCs. Mature osteoclasts also provided no protection
against the effects of BEZ235 on MM.1S (Supplementary Fig. S3C)
and OPM2 (Supplementary Fig. S3D) cell lines; MM.1S cells

supplemented with exogenous IL-6 (10 ng/mL) or IGF-1 (50 ng/mL)
also provided no survival benefit to MM.1S cells treated with BEZ235
(data not shown).
BEZ235 overcomes the effects of Akt but not Bcl-2 overexpression. In vitro anti-MM activity of BEZ235 against MM.1S
cells was compared with its activity against isogenic myristoylated
Akt-expressing or Bcl-2–overexpressing MM.1S cells. MM.1S cells
engineered to express myristoylated Akt or Bcl-2 were treated with
100 nmol/L BEZ235 for 48 hours and compared with parental cells.
MM.1S cells stably expressing myristoylated Akt had comparable
sensitivity as parental MM.1S cells (Fig. 2A), whereas cells
overexpressing Bcl-2 were less sensitive to BEZ235 (Fig. 2B).
Immunoblotting analysis of parental MM.1S cells treated with
100 nmol/L BEZ235 revealed decreased phosphorylation of Akt at
Ser473 and Thr308, with stable total Akt levels (Fig. 2C). Comparable
changes in Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation were observed with
BEZ235 treatment in Akt-overexpressing MM.1S cells (Fig. 2C). In
parental MM.1S cells, levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members Bad and Bcl-XL remained constant during BEZ235
exposure, but a compensatory increase in Bcl-2 levels was observed
(Fig. 2D). In Bcl-2–overexpressing MM.1S cells, stable high levels of
Bcl-2, Bad, and Bcl-XL were observed during BEZ235 treatment

Figure 2. Overexpression of Bcl-2, but not myristoylated Akt, provides protection against BEZ235. MM.1S cells engineered to overexpress Akt or Bcl-2 were
treated with BEZ235 for 48 h and compared with parental controls. MM.1S-Akt cells were equally active compared with parental MM.1S cells (A ), whereas
MM.1S-Bcl-2 cells were more resistant to BEZ235 than controls (B). C, immunoblotting analysis of parental MM.1S cells treated with 100 nmol/L BEZ235 revealed
decreased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308. Comparable results were obtained with BEZ235 treatment of the myristoylated Akt-expressing MM.1S-Akt
cells. D, during BEZ235 exposure, Bcl-2 levels increased in the parental MM.1S cells where Bad and Bcl-XL levels remained constant. Constitutively high levels
of Bcl-2, as well as stable levels of Bad, and Bcl-XL were observed in the Bcl-2–overexpressing MM.1S-Bcl-2 cells.

Figure 3. Treatment with BEZ235 induces apoptotic cell death in MM cells.
A, MM.1S cells were exposed to 100 nmol/L BEZ235 for 0 to 48 h. Cells were
collected, washed, stained for Annexin V and PI, and analyzed using flow
cytometry. Exposure to BEZ235 resulted in time-dependent increases in Annexin
V+ events, with increased Annexin V+PI+ events at later time points indicating
apoptotic cell death of MM.1S cells. B, immunoblotting analysis of MM.1S cells
treated with 100 nmol/L BEZ235 revealed cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP.
C, in addition, decrease in downstream targets phospho-mTOR,
phospho-p70S6K, and phospho-GSK3 (with late rebound for phospho-GSK3)
was observed in response to drug treatment.

(Fig. 2D), supporting the notion that high levels of Bcl-2 may be
associated with decreased sensitivity to BEZ235.
Cell cycle profiles of BEZ235-treated MM cells. The cell cycle
profile of BEZ235-treated MM cell lines was evaluated by PI
staining and flow cytometric analysis. Treatment of MM.1S cells
with BEZ235 (100 nmol/L for up to 48 hours) increased the
percentage of cells in G0-G1 phase followed by an increase in subG1 population (Supplementary Fig. S4).
BEZ235 causes apoptotic cell death in MM.1S cells. Analysis

staining. MM.1S cells treated with 100 nmol/L BEZ235 up to 48
hours were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. Annexin V+
and Annexin V+/PI+ staining increased in response to BEZ235
treatment at 48 hours (Fig. 3A).
Western blot analysis of MM.1S cells treated with BEZ235
revealed a pattern of molecular signaling events consistent with
inhibition of cell proliferation and initiation of cell death. During
the first 8–24 hours of BEZ235 treatment, apoptosis was associated
with cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; Fig. 3B). In addition, downstream targets of PI3K signaling
were affected, with phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6K, and phospho–glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) levels decreased in response
to BEZ235 treatment, although phospho-GSK3 levels increased at
later time points (Fig. 3C). In addition, nuclear translocation of
Fox3a was observed in U2OS cells in response to BEZ235 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
Pathway activation status analysis of MM cells treated with
BEZ235. Overall activity of signaling pathways can be revealed by
changes in select groups of genes previously shown to reflect the
pathway activation state. We specifically evaluated multiple
transcripts that collectively identify phenotypic changes induced
by BEZ235 treatment. We observed that BEZ235 treatment
triggers, as early as 4 hours, decreased amplitude in myc, ribosome,
and proteasome functional signatures, as well as in signatures
for high-risk MM, proangiogenic state and for undifferentiated
embryonic stem cells (Fig. 4). In addition, we observed changes in
specific transcript levels in various pathways, including cell cycle
(Supplementary Fig. S6A), cytokines (Supplementary Fig. S6B),
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S6C), heat shock proteins (Supplementary Fig. S6D), and proteasome-related genes (Supplementary
Fig. S6E).
In vivo activity of BEZ235. In vivo testing of BEZ235 in a s.c.
xenograft model was performed in nude mice injected with MM.1SGFP/luc cells (106 per mouse). BEZ235 treatment significantly
decreased tumor burden compared with controls (P = 0.033,
unpaired one-tailed t test; Fig. 5A). In addition, median overall
survival was not reached after a median follow-up of 48 days in
BEZ235-treated mice, whereas control mice had median overall
survival of 23 days (95% confidence interval, 21–26 days; P = 0.028,
log-rank test; Fig. 5B). No significant changes in weight or other
signs of potential toxicity were observed during treatment with
BEZ235 (Fig. 5C).
Combinations of BEZ235 with other anti-MM agents. We
evaluated combinations of BEZ235 with agents currently available
for the clinical management of MM (dexamethasone, bortezomib,
and doxorubicin). Combinations of BEZ235 with bortezomib
(Fig. 6A), doxorubicin (Fig. 6B), or dexamethasone (Fig. 6C)
exhibited additive effects against MM.1S cells across a broad range
of doses of either agent, suggesting that BEZ235 does not interfere
with anti-MM activity of these agents. Comparable results were
obtained with these combinations against KMS-18, KMS-12PE, and
ARP-1 MM cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the activity of the PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235 in preclinical models of MM. Inhibition of mTOR
triggers a compensatory activation of PI3K/Akt signaling (28). This
has been attributed to activation of upstream growth factor
receptors (e.g., IGF-1R) as a result of increased secretion of their
corresponding growth factors and has been considered a stress

response that tends to attenuate the activity of mTOR inhibitors.
This has provided a rationale for dual targeting of PI3K and mTOR.
Although this can be achieved with the combination of selective
inhibitors for each target, another strategy is to use agents, such as
BEZ235, which have activity against both PI3K and mTOR. In this
study, we show that this dual inhibitor is active against a large
panel of MM cell lines at low nanomolar levels. BEZ235 also
induces rapid commitment to cell death, requiring less than 16
hours of exposure in the most sensitive MM cell line. This is
particularly important for activity in vivo, where drug levels drop as
a result of metabolism and excretion and thus important for
translation to clinical applications. Importantly, MM cell lines and
patient samples are sensitive to BEZ235 at concentrations that
have been previously reported to be achievable in vivo (6).
Because the bone microenvironment plays such an important
role in the resistance to conventional anti-MM therapies, the ability
of BEZ235 to overcome these factors is encouraging. In our studies,
BEZ235 overcomes the protection conferred to MM cells by IL-6
and IGF-1 cytokines, stromal cells, and osteoclasts. The activity
of BEZ235 in MM cocultures with human stromal cells and
osteoclasts suggests that the drug will be active in the bone where
MM lesions interact with these cells, resulting in increased RANKL
levels and the maturation of osteoclasts at these sites (29). We
show that BEZ235 overcomes these factors in vitro and causes
apoptotic MM cell death, shown by Annexin V/PI and immunoblotting analysis, in response to BEZ235 exposure.

The pattern of in vitro anti-MM activity of BEZ235 is distinct
from other currently available agents, thus suggesting that BEZ235
can be used to treat MM patients resistant to other anti-MM
agents. Specifically, we show that BEZ235 is active against Dox40, a
cell line that is resistant to chemotherapy, and MM.1R, a cell line
resistant to dexamethasone. In addition, molecular signatures
associated with high-risk MM, angiogenesis, myc activity, and
proteasome function are all down-regulated in response to BEZ235
exposure. These effects on key pathways involved in MM
pathophysiology may explain, in part, why BEZ235 may be able
to overcome resistance to other anti-MM agents. In addition, our
data showing no antagonism with various anti-MM agents in vitro
indicate that it is possible to combine BEZ235 with other clinically
used anti-MM agents.
An important consideration for the development of any
anticancer agent is its therapeutic index. Because the PI3K
pathway also plays a central role in normal cell proliferation and
survival, targeting of this pathway might result in serious toxicities
(30). In this study, however, the majority of MM cell lines are more
sensitive than all of the nonneoplastic tissues. Treatment of various
stromal and hepatocyte cell lines, as well as PBMCs, at doses of
BEZ235 that induced killing of both MM cell lines and patient
samples in vitro, had minimal effects on these normal cells.
PI3K signaling is critical for many cell and tumor types, but these
data indicate that PI3K pathway inhibition may be particularly
active in MM. PI3K mutations are present, but infrequent, in MM

Figure 4. Pathway signature changes triggered by BEZ235 treatment. MM.1S cells were cultured for 2 to 24 h in the presence or absence of 100 nmol/L BEZ235.
Total RNA was extracted and purified, cDNA synthesized, and cRNA labeled before hybridization to the HT-U133A and HT-U133B arrays. The average
(F 95% confidence intervals) increase in gene expression (absolute values) in BEZ235 treated versus control is shown for various pathway signatures.

Antimyeloma Activity of NVP-BEZ235

Figure 5. Activity of BEZ235 in vivo . MM.1S-GFP/luc cells (106) were
injected s.c. into nude mice. Following 2 wk of tumor engraftment, mice were
randomly assigned to receive 30 mg/kg BEZ235 or vehicle orally. Tumor size,
survival, and weights were assessed. Mouse tumor burden was significantly
reduced (A ; P = 0.033, unpaired one-tailed t test) and overall survival was
significantly increased (B; P = 0.028, log-rank test) in the treated mice compared
with controls. Points , average tumor size; bars , SE. C, in addition, the

cells (31). However, it is plausible that MM cells can have
constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway through other
mechanisms. This can be explained, at least in part, by the critical
role of IL-6 and IGF-1 signaling in mediating the survival and
growth of MM cells via the PI3K/Akt pathway (4). Because BEZ235
inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway at multiple levels, it may overcome
the compensatory drug resistance mechanisms that have developed with other selective inhibitors against individual targets of
this pathway. In our study, BEZ235 overcomes the protective effect

conferred to MM.1S cells by overexpression of constitutively active
Akt, likely due to its downstream inhibition of mTOR. The ability of
BEZ235 to block the PI3K pathway at multiple levels may also
explain its potent (submicromolar) single-agent activity. We believe
that the multilevel activity of BEZ235, in addition to the profound
sensitivity of the MM cell lines to this compound, may explain why
we did not observe significant synergy with other anti-MM agents.
Our data do not exclude the use of BEZ235 with other agents
clinically. In fact, the lack of antagonism in combination with
bortezomib (PS-341), doxorubicin, or dexamethasone suggests the
feasibility of future clinical trial combinations of BEZ235 in MM.
Because PI3K is a central signaling node mediating tumor cell
proliferation, survival, and drug resistance in many cancers,
BEZ235 may be active in a broad spectrum of other tumor models
(6–8). Although we have documented more pronounced submicromolar activity in MM compared with a panel of select solid
tumor cell lines, it is possible that other tumor models that depend
on PI3K and/or mTOR (i.e., prostate cancer) may also respond to
BEZ235. Nonetheless, the ability of BEZ235 to overcome cytokine
and stromal protection, Akt overexpression, as well as its in vivo
activity in MM suggest that targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
