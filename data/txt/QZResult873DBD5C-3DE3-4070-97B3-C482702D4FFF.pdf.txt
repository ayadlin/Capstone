BACKGROUND: A phase 2 trial was carried out to assess the antineoplastic activity of 2 courses of cyclophosphamide-etoposide in relapsed osteosarcoma patients. METHODS: Twenty-six relapsed osteosarcoma
patients with a median age of 18.5 years (8.3-47.1) were enrolled. Seven patients were in first relapse (27%),
11 in second relapse (42%), 7 in third relapse (27%), and 1 in fourth relapse (4%). Eighteen patients had
bone metastasis at study entry (69%). Cyclophosphamide was given at 4 g/m2 on Day 1 followed by etoposide at 200 mg/m2 on Days 2, 3, and 4. Second cyclophosphamide and etoposide was planned at 21 days
to 28 days from the previous one. The primary endpoint of the study was the clinical benefit at 4 months
measured as progression-free survival. RESULTS: Progression-free survival at 4 months was 42%. Five
patients achieved responses (19%), 9 patients had stable disease (35%), and 12 had tumor progression
(46%). Overall survival (OS) at 1 year was 50%. The only grade 4 extrahematological toxicities were fever
(5%), acute bronchospasm (4%) and stomatitis (18%). Six patients (23%) underwent radical surgery after
cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 may arrest osteosarcoma progression in a significant number of patients (54%). Osteosarcoma progression arrest after
cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 translates in a better OS. Cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 had

The prognosis of osteosarcoma patients has only marginally improved over the last decade,1-9 and the
survival of relapsed patients remains very poor, especially for patients with extra pulmonary metastasis.
The overall survival (OS) for relapsed bone metastatic patients at 4 years is 0%.10-12 New strategies are,
therefore, necessary to improve the prognosis of this subgroup of patients. Several agents, or their

153SmEDTPA (samarium),15-17 topotecan,18 irinotecan,19 gemcitabine,20 docetaxel,21 imatinib mesylate,22
and temozolamide,23 have been investigated. However,
the response rate in this very high-risk cohort of patients is
low and, more importantly, survival time is short. Mantadakis reported encouraging results in a group of children
with advanced or refractory sarcomas treated with fractionated doses of cyclophosphamide and etoposide;24 thereafter, Saleh reported excellent responses on previously
untreated osteosarcoma patients.25 Finally, RodriguezGalindo reported a response rate of 28.5% (complete and
partial) with a median response duration of 5 months26
after cyclophosphamide and etoposide combination in osteosarcoma refractory patients. Because its mobilizing activity is well-known,27 cyclophosphamide and etoposide
might, therefore, represent an interesting therapeutic
option, thus giving chemosensitive osteosarcoma patients
a prospective of high-dose chemotherapy, while for
others, experimental treatment should be considered.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients were considered eligible for this protocol if they
had: 1) diagnosis of high-grade osteosarcoma; 2) extra
pulmonary relapse; 3) pulmonary relapse ineligible for
surgery; 4) pulmonary relapse within 12 months from the
previous one; 5) age under 50; 6) normal liver and kidney
functions; 7) normal cardiac function with an ejection
fraction over 50%; 8) white blood cell count greater than
3  109/L and platelets more than 50  109/L. Before
entering the study, patients underwent an accurate physical examination, total body computerized tomography
(CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the primary tumor and all metastatic sites, and a radionuclide
bone scan. All patients or their parents signed the
informed consent consistent with local institutional
review board guidelines. The local ethical committee
approved the study. Twenty-six patients were enrolled
between July 2002 and September 2006. All patients
received full doses of active antiosteosarcoma agents as the
front-line therapy, including high-dose methotrexate,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin.28-30 Twelve of 26 patients

(46%) also received high-dose Ifosfamide for a previous
tumor recurrence. None of the patients had received cyclophosphamide or etoposide before entering the study.
Twelve patients (46%) had both osseous and extraosseous
metastasis, 6 patients (23%) had bone metastasis only,
and 8 patients (30%) had extraosseous metastasis ineligible for surgery. Eighteen patients had bone metastasis at
study entry (69%).
Endpoints
The primary endpoint of this study was the clinical benefit at 4 months defined as progression-free survival. Progression-free survival at 6 months for first-line therapy
and 3 months for the second-line therapy have been proposed as reasonable reference values for a clinical benefit
phase 2 Trial.31,32 As our patient population was mixed
with regard to the number of previous therapies, stable
disease for 4 months was considered long enough to
define the clinical benefit. (Table 1 reports the clinical
benefit at 4 months.) The objective response was assessed
by RECIST criteria, whenever possible.33,34
The secondary endpoints were toxicity and the
mobilizing stem cell effect of cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 treatment.

Treatment
All but 1 patient underwent 2 courses of cyclophosphamide
and etoposide as outlined in the protocol. Cyclophosphamide was administrated as 4000 mg/m2 over 3 hours of
infusion on Day 1, etoposide 100 mg/m2 over 1 hour twice
daily for 3 days on Days 2, 3, and 4 (total dose 600 mg/m2).
As hemorrhagic cystitis prophylaxis all patients received
mesna (Uromitexan) at 1400 mg/m2 before and after 4
hours and 8 hours from cyclophosphamide start. Together
with mesna all patients had hyperhydration (3000 mL/m2/
day) during chemotherapy administration.
After chemotherapy, all patients were discharged
from the hospital and the hematological check was performed on an outpatient basis. The scheduled minimal
interval between first and second cyclophosphamide and
etoposide courses was 21 days. At the end of cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 treatment, patients underwent
complete restaging. The evaluation included conventional
radiographs, magnetic resonance (MRI) bone scan, or a

computed tomography (CT) scan of the primary tumor
and all metastatic sites, and radionuclide bone scans.
All patients with no progression after cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 were then treated with an experimental protocol with either samarium 10 mCi/Kg and/or
high-dose chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) according to the presence or absence of bone metastasis. Thereafter,
all progression free patients underwent reduced intensity
stem cell transplantation from, if available, their matched sibling donor (MSD). Patients with no MSD had IL-2 treatment for 5 days a week twice monthly for 12 cycles.

absolute leukocyte count. Briefly, when CD34 þ /lL
was 20, patients underwent leukapheresis until the
CD34 þ collection was above 5  106/Kg. The second cyclophosphamide and etoposide course was also
adopted as the mobilizing course in some cases. Otherwise, the second cyclophosphamide and etoposide
course was followed by G-CSF 5 lg/Kg.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed as of August 10, 2008. To evaluate
the clinical benefit, the progression-free survival at 4
months was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier statistics.36 The
differences between curves were then analyzed by the
log-rank test.37 Progression-free survival was defined as
the length of time from study entry to the date of
documented progression or death, whichever occurred
first. OS was calculated from study entry to death for
any causes by Kaplan-Meier statistics. The response
rates after the cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2
treatment were assessed through the 2-sided Fisher
exact test per P < .05 with Statistica 6.1 software
(StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla). To assess cyclophosphamide
and etoposide 2 responsiveness predictors, 2 variables
were considered for their potential impact in osteosarcoma response/progression arrest: 1) interval between
diagnosis and first relapse (<18 months vs 18
months); and 2) the site of last relapse (bone metastasis vs extraosseous relapse);

RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics and Follow-up

Toxicity
The hematological and extrahematological toxicities of
the cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 courses were
assessed according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) classification system.35

The major characteristics of this patient population are
given in Table 2. Table 2 shows the disease status at study
entry and the cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2
response of each patient. The median follow-up of the
entire patient population is 333 days (58-2023). All 26
patients were assessable for efficacy and no patients were
lost at follow-up.

Stem Cell Mobilization
After the first cyclophosphamide and etoposide
course, all patients received G-CSF at 10 lg/Kg
from Day 7. CD34 þ stem cells were counted in
the peripheral blood from day þ 9 according to the

respectively. When we focused on patients with (or without) bone metastasis at study entry, progression-free survival at 4 months was 28% compared with 75% (P ¼ .14,
Fig. 1). Progression-free survival at 1-year was 18% versus
30% for bone or extraosseous metastatic patients (data
not shown). When we analyzed OS, 78% of patients having tumor growth-arrest were alive at 1 year from study
entry compared with 18% for nonresponders (P ¼ .009,
Fig. 2). Median survival was 767 days (398-1383) for responders, 575 days (206-2023) for patients having SD and

(19%). Two of 5 patients reached CR and 3 reached PR.
Nine of 26 patients had stable disease (SD) after cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 treatment (35%) and 12
of 26 had tumor progression (46%). Fourteen patients
(54%) had tumor progression arrest after cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2. Importantly, 6 of 26 patients had
radical surgery after cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2
(23%).

and first relapse, we found that 3 of 14 patients
achieved responses (21%), 7 patients had SD (50%),
and 4 had tumor progression (28%), while for others
(<18 months), only 1 of 12 had a response (8%), 3
had SD (25%), and 8 patients had tumor progression
(67%). In brief, patients having a longer interval diagnosis and first relapse had 71% of tumor progression
arrest compared with 33% for patients with shorter
intervals (P ¼ .11). Among patients with bone metastasis, 2 of 18 experienced responses (11%), a further 6
had SD (33%), and 10 patients had tumor progression
(55%). Among patients with bone metastasis, 1 patient
had an extraosseous CR and a SD on osseous metastasis, and the other patient had a dramatic reduction
(>75%) of a clavicle lesion together with a disappearance of 13 and 8 lung metastases on the right and left
lung, respectively. Among patients with extraosseous
metastasis, responses were documented in 2 of 8
patients (25%), an SD was observed in 4 patients
(50%) and 2 patients had tumor progression (25%).
In brief, patients with extraosseous relapse had a 50%
tumor growth arrest compared with 44% of patients
with bone metastasis (P ¼ .77).
Toxicity
No deaths related to cyclophosphamide and etoposide
2 treatments were documented, and none of the
patients experienced life threatening extra-hematological toxicity. Briefly, among the 51 cyclophosphamide
and etoposide 2 courses, we had grade 3 fever toxicities after 9 courses (16%), grade 4 after 3 courses
(5%), grade 3 mucositis after 4 courses (7%), and
grade 4 after 10 courses (18%). All patients experienced grade 4 hematological toxicities, which were
mainly managed in an outpatient setting.

Stem Cell Mobilization
Twenty-4 patients (96%) achieved the target CD34 þ
cell collection >5  106/Kg. The median number of
CD34 þ cell harvest was 9.8  106/Kg (range 5.1-13.9)
and the median number of leukapheresis was 2 (range 16). One patient underwent PBSC collection after highdose ifosfamide to treat a previous relapse. Moreover, the
only patient who failed the stem cell mobilization after
2984

the double cyclophosphamide and etoposide developed
early tumor progression and she was taken off the study.
Eighteen patients collected sufficient CD34 þ stem cells
after the first cyclophosphamide and etoposide course
(69%), 3 patients underwent CD34 þ harvest after the
first and second cyclophosphamide and etoposide course,
because of a poor collection after the first cyclophosphamide and etoposide, and 3 patients underwent CD34 þ
collection after the second cyclophosphamide and etoposide course only. In these few cases, the first cyclophosphamide and etoposide was chosen only as cytoreductive
therapy. None of the patients required additional bone
marrow stem cell collection for a subsequent high-dose
radiometabolic or chemotherapy rescue.

DISCUSSION
Patients with relapsed osteosarcoma have a very poor
prognosis. In one of the largest series, reported by Ferrari
et al., patients having a first relapse had 0% post relapse
survival at 3 years if surgery was not carried out, compared
with 39% for patients having surgery. Moreover, Ferrari
found that lung metastatic patients had a 33% 5-year survival compared with 11% for extra lung first relapse.8
Cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 were studied on
relapsed patients to assess their antiosteosarcoma activity.
Mantadakis reported a series in which various sarcoma
patients including osteosarcoma were treated with cyclophosphamide and etoposide (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/
m2/day, total dose 2500 mg/m2 and etoposide 100 mg/
m2/day, total dose 500 mg/m2). The median survival for
all relapsed patients was 11 months from the start of cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Saleh et al. reported
excellent results (88% of response) for osteosarcoma
patients treated with cyclophosphamide and etoposide
(cyclophosphamide 6 pulses of 300 mg/m2 each 12 hours
per 6 doses, total dose 1800 mg/m2 and etoposide 200
mg/m2/day, total dose 600 mg/m2), but all were treated as
first-line chemotherapy. Importantly, 3 of 5 patients with
metastatic disease achieved complete or partial responses
(60%). Finally, Rodriguez-Galindo reported on 14
patients treated with cyclophosphamide and etoposide
(cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day, total dose 2500 mg/
m2 and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day, total dose 500 mg/m2)
with refractory osteosarcoma in which the overall response
rate was 28.5%. The 19% response rate observed in our
Cancer

group of patients with relapsed osteosarcoma (mainly
with bone metastasis) is comparable to the 28.5% of
responses in the Rodriguez-Galindo study in which only 5
of 14 patients had bone metastasis (36%). Moreover, our
results in these very high-risk cohort patients are likewise
comparable to the series in which patients received the
ifosfamide-etoposide combination (16%-48% response
rates).
One of the peculiarities of our study is the single
high-dose administration of cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2
given over 3 hours) compared with other studies in which
the cyclophosphamide was scheduled over 3 to 5 days.
Cyclophosphamide is typically given as fractionated doses
because the autoinduction of enzyme activity increases the
concentration of the active metabolites of alkylating
agents, an effect that has been shown for both cyclophosphamide38,39 and ifosfamide.40-42 Moreover, single-dose
administration of these alkylating agents may result in
decreased bioactivation due to saturable kinetic mechanisms, which favor the inactivating elimination pathways.
Therefore, as was reported above, fractionated administration alters kinetic properties to avoid the elimination
pathways and to favor bioactivation of enzyme activity.
However, this advantageous pharmacological phenomenon has only been explored with ifosfamide. Conversely,
the administration of a single high dose of cyclophosphamide has been routinely used as stem cell mobilizing
chemotherapy to move stem cells from bone marrow to
peripheral blood in stem cell transplant settings.
In our study, we observed that: 1) the antineoplastic
effect of the cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 combination in relapsed osteosarcomas is established; 2)
responses were observed in both extraosseous and bone
metastatic patients; 3) a trend for higher tumor growth
arrest and higher response rate was found among patients
with longer interval diagnosis and first relapse. The statistical significance was not reached but this probably reflects
the low number of patients treated. Although the further
treatments (such as high-dose carboplatin, etoposide, or
Samarium) might well have contributed to these results, it
is quite clear that cyclophosphamide and etoposide has a
definite antineoplastic activity, which probably translates
into a clinical benefit.
In conclusion, cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2
showed activity against relapsed osteosarcoma, but further
large cohort patient studies are warranted to establish the
Cancer

optimal timing for cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2
treatment administration. If others confirmed our data,
the cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 course might be
considered in the setting of primary metastatic patients
for whom no adequate therapy is available at present.
Moreover, in relapsed osteosarcoma patients, cyclophosphamide and etoposide 2 might allow a control of tumor growth and, together with its mobilizing stem cell
effect, open a therapeutic window in which novel therapies may be investigated.
