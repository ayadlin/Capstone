Abstract
Reduced expression of proapoptotic and terminal differentiation genes in conjunction with increased levels of the
proinflammatory and angiogenesis-inducing enzymes, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), correlate with malignant transformation of oral
intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN). Accordingly, this study investigated the effects of a 10% (w/w) freeze-dried black raspberry
gel on oral IEN histopathology, gene expression profiles,
intraepithelial COX-2 and iNOS proteins, and microvascular
densities. Our laboratories have shown that freeze-dried black
raspberries possess antioxidant properties and also induce
keratinocyte apoptosis and terminal differentiation. Oral
IEN tissues were hemisected to provide samples for pretreatment diagnoses and establish baseline biochemical and
molecular variables. Treatment of the remaining lesional
tissue (0.5 g gel applied four times daily for 6 weeks) began
1 week after the initial biopsy. RNA was isolated from snapfrozen IEN lesions for microarray analyses, followed by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR validation. Additional
epithelial gene-specific quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
analyses facilitated the assessment of target tissue treatment
effects. Surface epithelial COX-2 and iNOS protein levels
and microvascular densities were determined by image
analysis quantified immunohistochemistry. Topical berry
gel application uniformly suppressed genes associated with
RNA processing, growth factor recycling, and inhibition of
apoptosis. Although the majority of participants showed
posttreatment decreases in epithelial iNOS and COX-2
proteins, only COX-2 reductions were statistically significant.
These data show that berry gel application modulated oral
IEN gene expression profiles, ultimately reducing epithelial
COX-2 protein. In a patient subset, berry gel application also
reduced vascular densities in the superficial connective tissues
and induced genes associated with keratinocyte terminal
differentiation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4945–57]

and an economic cost that rivals or exceeds other solid tumors
(1–3). Recognized risk factors for the development of oral SCC
include tobacco and alcohol use, poor oral hygiene, and potentially
high-risk human papilloma virus subtypes (4, 5). Other data also
imply a role for sustained inflammation in oral SCC pathogenesis
(6, 7). Increased expression of two inflammation-induced proinflammatory enzymes, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), is associated with malignant
transformation of precancerous oral lesions (8–10). Notably, high
levels of COX-2– and iNOS-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen
species can promote tumorigenesis by a variety of mechanisms
(6, 7). Oxidative and nitrosative stresses can induce nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA mutations and inactivation of key cytoprotective enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (11).
In addition, increased COX-2 activity is associated with the
suppression of apoptosis, oxygenase-mediated bioactivation of
carcinogens, and reductase-induced conversion of compounds to
potential mutagens (12). iNOS activation induces angiogenesis via
nitric oxide’s ability to serve as a signaling molecule for vascular
endothelial growth factors (VEGF; ref. 13), and up-regulates basic
fibroblast growth factor (14). Finally, as nitric oxide directly
activates both of the COX isoforms (15), there is a positive
correlation between cellular nitric oxide levels and COX function.
Oral intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN), histopathologically described as grades of epithelial dysplasia, is the recognized precursor
to oral SCC. Oral IEN lesions present as white, red, or erythroleukoplakic patches (16). Although up to 36% of oral IEN lesions
undergo malignant transformation, we cannot predict which
lesions will progress (17). Although complete surgical excision
remains the standard of care for advanced lesions, i.e., moderate
dysplasia or higher, recurrences of lesional tissue or development
of new premalignant lesions are not uncommon (18). Repeated
surgeries increase costs and morbidity and negatively affect the
ability to conduct clinical exams due to the accumulation of scar
tissue.
Chemoprevention is a potential primary or adjunctive oral IEN
treatment strategy. Black raspberries are one food that has shown
significant chemopreventive efficacy (19–29). Furthermore, the
freeze-drying process concentrates black raspberries’ bioactive
constituents f10-fold on a weight basis relative to the natural fruit
(27). Freeze-dried black raspberries (FBR) contain appreciable
quantities of many putative chemopreventive compounds including vitamins A, C, and E, folic acid, calcium, selenium, a and h
carotene, ellagic acid, ferulic acid, coumaric acid, and quercitin in
addition to multiple anthocyanins and phytosterols (20, 24). Our
data show the ability of FBR to suppress redox-mediated

COX-2 and iNOS (26), and suppressed tumor-associated angiogenesis (25). In addition, phase I human clinical trials have shown that
orally administered FBR were well-tolerated (27, 28) and also showed
the potential for FBR metabolism following oral administration by
the detection of berry metabolites in the urine (29). Recently, our
laboratories formulated a 10% FBR (w/w) bioadhesive berry gel for
application to the human oral mucosa (30). Results from this clinical
trial show that berry gel topical application significantly reduces loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) indices at chromosomal loci associated with
tumor suppressor genes in human oral IEN lesions without
induction of any deleterious side effects (31).
We hypothesized that due to the anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant properties of FBRs and their ability to suppress redoxmediated cell signaling, FBR gel application would be clinically
active in oral IEN lesions. Accordingly, this study evaluated the
effects of topical application of a 10% (w/w) FBR bioadhesive gel on
oral IEN variables that included: histopathologic diagnosis, gene
expression profiles, lesional epithelial COX-2 and iNOS levels, and
microvascular density (MVD) of the superficial connective tissue.
Our data show that berry gel application uniformly suppressed
genes associated with RNA processing, growth factor recycling, and
inhibition of apoptosis, and significantly reduced epithelial COX-2
levels. Furthermore, in a subset of patients, gel application also
induced genes associated with apoptosis and keratinocyte terminal
differentiation and reduced MVD.

Materials and Methods
Berry gel manufacturing. The bioadhesive gels used in this clinical
trial were prepared using current good manufacturing practices at the
cGMP facility within the Center for Pharmaceutical Science and Technology

Posttreatment diagnosis

at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. A description of the quality
control measures and details of the gel composition and method of
manufacture have been described previously (30). Briefly, the gel
composition used for the clinical trial consisted of (in %, w/w): Noveon
AA1 (NF; Noveon, Inc.) 1.35%, Carbopol 971P (NF; BF Goodrich Specialty
Chemicals) 1.575%, glycerin (USP) 1.0%, edentate disodium (USP) 0.1%,
2-phenoxyethanol (BP) 1.0%, benzyl alcohol (USP) 1.0%, FBR 10%, and
purified water as needed to obtain 100% (30). Based on our previous
stability and mucosal penetration data (30), slight modifications of the
prototype gel were made for the clinical trial gel. The FBR concentration
was increased to 10% (w/w) and the pH of the gel was fixed at pH 3.5 to
stabilize the more biologically active flavylium cation of the anthocyanin
molecules.
Human clinical trials. Thirty-two adults (age range, 18–76 years)
consented to participate in our clinical trial, which received approval from
The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board (protocol 2003C0050).
Criteria for inclusion as IEN participants were microscopically confirmed
premalignant oral epithelial changes (noninvasive disease) and no use of
tobacco products for 6 weeks prior to, or for the duration of, the clinical
trial. Exclusion criteria included use of tobacco products within 6 weeks
prior to or during the clinical trial, or a microscopic diagnosis of invasive
oral SCC. Twenty participants had oral lesions that were clinically
consistent with, and microscopically confirmed, as premalignant oral
lesions (histopathologic diagnoses ranged from epithelial atypia to severe
dysplasia, see Table 1A). The site, size, and consistency of premalignant
lesions were recorded and clinical photographs obtained. Patient no. 4
(normal histology) and no. 16 (biopsy-confirmed invasive oral SCC) did not
meet the study criteria and were therefore excluded from participation.
The remaining 10 individuals ( five men and five women, aged between
24 and 34 years) exhibited clinically normal oral mucosa, and were included
as trial participants (a) to allow additional observations for treatmentassociated side effects, and (b) to evaluate the clinical and histopathologic
effects of berry gel application on normal oral mucosa. The normal
participants’ treatment protocol was identical to the IEN patients except

The remaining three normal participants reported negligible (one participant)

ensured that pretreatment indices for each variable to be evaluated were
obtained, thereby allowing each IEN participant to serve as their own
internal control. Treatment entailed multiple dosing throughout the day,
0.5 g applied four times daily for 6 weeks for a total 84 g applied over the
study duration. As human oral epithelium regenerates approximately every
28 days, a 6-week duration ensured the presence of FBR for at least one
complete cycle of epithelial regeneration. Gel effects on LOH indices at loci
associated with tumor suppressor genes in this cohort are reported
separately (31).
Because the ventral-lateral tongue is a high incidence site for oral IEN
and SCCs (4, 6), this location was selected as the gel application site for the
normal participants. All participants were monitored during the trial to
observe for any adverse side effects, and in persons with premalignant
lesions, any clinical progression in lesional tissue. All participants returned
their used gel tubes at each weekly follow-up visit. Toxicity was assessed
using National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria version 3.0. Any
toxicity equivalent to grade 2 or higher was considered dose-limiting.
Clinical photographs were taken, and biopsies obtained from the treated
ventral-lateral tongue of the normal participants upon study conclusion. In
the persons with premalignant lesions, excisional biopsies, which included
the residual treated lesional tissue and initial biopsy site, were conducted.
Tissue samples were handled as previously described.
Light microscopic diagnoses of all tissues were based on a seven-grade
scale (normal, hyperkeratosis, atypia, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia,
severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, invasive SCC). In this study, the
diagnosis ‘‘hyperkeratosis’’ alone conveyed a benign, reactive change without

evidence of premalignant potential. In contrast, ‘‘atypia’’ signified architectural and cytologic alterations that in the clinical setting of an adherent
demarcated white plaque represents early premalignant change. Two
board-certified oral and maxillofacial pathologists reached agreement
before a final histopathologic diagnosis was rendered.
RNA isolation and microarray analyses. Total RNA was isolated from
snap-frozen patient biopsies using Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene). The RNA concentrations were measured using Nanodrop ND-1000
(Nanodrop). The integrity of the total RNA was evaluated using capillary
electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies) and quantified
using a Nanodrop 1000 (Nanodrop). Following confirmation of RNA quality,
an Ovation Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (NuGen
Technologies, Inc.) was used to prepare amplified, biotin-labeled cDNA
from total RNA following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly,
first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique
first-strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following
double-strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA was achieved by
using an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIA
DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement, and RNA
cleavage. The amplified SPIA cDNA was purified and subjected to a twostep fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented/biotinylated
cDNA content was measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and the
quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using an
Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.
For each array, 2.2 Ag of cDNA was hybridized onto Human Genome
133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Inc.), containing probe sets that measure

22,000 transcripts from Human RNA. Sequences used in the design of the
array were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence
clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001)
and were then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other
publicly available databases including the Washington University EST trace
repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human
genome database (April 2001 release). Hybridization was conducted for
16 h at 45jC followed by washing and staining of microarrays in a Fluidics
Station 450 (Affymetrix). GeneChips were scanned in a GeneChip Scanner
3000 (Affymetrix) and CEL files generated from DAT files using GeneChip
Operating Software (Affymetrix). The probe set signals, which were
generated using the RMA algorithm in ArrayAssist 3.4 (Stratagene), were
used to determine differential gene expression by pair-wise comparisons.
The genes that were altered by 1.5-fold either way were sorted and used
for further interpretation of the microarray data. Microarray data were
validated by conduction of quantitative RT-PCR analyses on three
consistently down-regulated genes (SFRS7, SFRS11, and LGALS8) and five
up-regulated genes (KRT2B, DSC1, UGT2B, SPPR3, and UBD), using matched
pretreatment and posttreatment RNA from four donors for each gene
evaluated. In order to establish which pathways were affected by gel
treatment, microarray analyses were conducted midway through the trial
on 13 matched pretreated and posttreated IEN samples.
Quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Total RNA (100 ng) was reversetranscribed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems). All gene-specific TaqMan MGB primer and probes (FAM
dye-labeled) and human h-glucuronidase (h-GUS) endogenous control (VIC
dye-labeled) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Real-time PCR was
performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. One
microliter of cDNA was used in a total volume of 20 AL real-time PCR

reaction containing 10 AL of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 1 AL of
gene-specific TaqMan MGB primer and probe, and 1 AL of human h-GUS.
The PCR was run with an initial AmpErase enzyme activation step at 50jC
for 2 min, followed by a run at 95jC for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95jC for
15 s, and at 60jC for 1 min. The comparative CT method was used to
calculate RNA expression level. The amount of target, normalized to a
h-GUS endogenous control and relative to the normal patients, is given by
2DDCT, where DDCT = DCT (target)  DCT (mean value of normal patients),
DCT is the CT target gene subtracted from the CT of h-GUS, and CT is the
threshold cycle.
Immunohistochemistry and image analysis for epithelial COX-2 and
iNOS. COX-2 and iNOS protein staining was conducted on serially sectioned
paraffin-embedded pretreatment and posttreatment specimens from all
of the IEN patients. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by
pretreatment with 3% H2O2, followed by microwave processing to facilitate
antigen retrieval. Sections were then treated with 5% normal serum, 1%
bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, and then incubated with
either the primary antibody [goat anti–COX-2 polyclonal antibody, 2 Ag/mL
dilution (Cayman Chemical), or anti-iNOS rabbit polyclonal antibody,
1:500 dilution (Biomol International)] or PBS (negative control) at 4jC
overnight. Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) was then applied
and sections incubated for 30 min. Immunoreactions of methyl green
counterstained sections were visualized using the VIP substrate (Vector).
Images were captured using a DS-Fi1 5-megapixel color digital camera
(Nikon). The percentages of positive staining areas were analyzed using
Image-Pro Plus 6.2 software (Media Cybernetics). The area of interest was
defined as the entire epithelium excluding the acellular keratin layer.

tissue for further studies. These samples were stained and analyzed to
determine MVD. Five-micron sections were mounted on SuperFrost Plus
slides (Fisher Scientific) and then successively deparaffinized, rehydrated,
treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min to block
endogenous peroxidase, and microwaved in citrated buffer (pH 6.0) for
antigen retrieval. Sections were then blocked in 5% normal horse serum, 1%
bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, incubated with anti-CD34
mouse monoclonal antibody (1:20, BioGenex), washed, and then incubated
with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200) followed by horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated avidin complex (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector
Laboratories). The sections were then developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine
(Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
The CD34-stained tissue sections were captured at 200-fold image scale
[microscopic field, 1,280  960 pixels (width  height), 300 dpi resolution]
using a Nikon DS-Fi-1 5-megapixel digital camera and Image-Pro Plus
software. The images were imported into Adobe PhotoDeluxe software, and
displayed on a high-resolution 17-inch color monitor. The area of interest
was defined as the connective tissue located 90 Am underlying the most
inferior epithelial rete ridge. Microvessels were then manually counted on
the computer screen. Any single brown-stained cell (CD34 positive) or
cluster of endothelial cells was counted as a single vessel. MVD was
calculated as the mean number of microvessels per area of interest in the
microscopic computerized field (200 magnification).
Statistical analyses. The effects of berry gel application on surface
epithelial COX-2 and iNOS proteins were analyzed using a Wilcoxon sign
rank test. Findings with P < 0.05 values were considered to be significant.

Results
Berry gel use elicited no deleterious effects. Toxic responses
such as hematologic disturbances would not be anticipated with
the use of a natural product. There were concerns, however,
regarding potential complications such as a contact mucositis, or
due to the sugar content in berries, Candidal infections. None of
the 30 trial participants developed any adverse effects. Furthermore, the treated tissue sites in the normal tissue donors retained
normal clinical and microscopic appearances (data not shown).
As determined by the minimal residual gel in the returned berry gel
tubes (>95% dose used), patient compliance was high.
Oral IEN lesion participant demographics and histopathologic diagnoses. Table 1A depicts the IEN patient demographics
and histopathologic diagnoses. Follow-up information on a subset
of these patients (Table 1B) following the clinical trial is discussed
later. IEN patients were older than the normal tissue donors, and
the majority had a previous history of tobacco and alcohol use.
Seventy percent of the patients had either multifocal lesions and/or
a history of recurrent disease at the selected treatment site, factors
associated with a higher-risk cohort which is more recalcitrant to
treatment. Histopathologic improvement was seen in seven
patients’ lesions, disease progression (increase) in grade in four
patients, and nine patients’ lesions exhibited no change (stable
disease) in microscopic appearance. Lesional grade decreases were
not restricted to lower grade lesions as the pretreatment diagnoses
were severe or moderate dysplasia in 20% (4 out of 20) of the seven
lesions that showed histologic improvement (Table 1A). The
youngest IEN patient (no. 9), who had three previous diagnoses
of epithelial dysplasia at the treatment site (these biopsies
preceded her entrance into the clinical trial), had complete clinical
and microscopic lesional regression following treatment. This site
has retained a normal histology 15 months following trial cessation
(Table 1B). The posttreatment biopsy of patient no. 8 showed an
increase of three grades, from mild dysplasia (pretreatment) to
focal carcinoma in situ (posttreatment). Patient no. 8’s lesional
tissue was remarkable for its extremely subtle clinical appearance,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

which introduced the prospect of sampling error at the
pretreatment biopsy.
Clinical measurements were not used as therapeutic indicators
due to our study design (lesional tissues hemisected to provide
baseline variables) and the fact that the clinical appearances of
oral IEN lesions are dynamic and can vary from week to week,
regardless of treatment (17). Although pretreatment IEN lesions
ranged from 0.3  0.3 to 2.5  1.5 cm (Table 1A), pretreatment
sizes had no apparent effects on therapeutic responsiveness.
Modulation of oral IEN gene expression profiles by berry gel
application. Functional annotation groupings and their corresponding Benjamini scores were used to identify genes consistently
down-regulated following gel treatment. Twenty-seven genes,
which encompassed RNA processing, signal transduction, and
inflammatory pathways showed uniform down-regulation (mean
decrease z 1.5-fold) following berry gel application (Table 2). The
majority (13) of the down-regulated genes involved RNA processing
and included transcriptional activation, RNA splicing, and nuclear
export. Other down-regulated genes included DUSP5, CTSL2, PIGL
(signaling pathways) and LGALS8, RNASET2, and CFLAR, which
function in integrin-associated interactions, chromosomal rearrangements, and inhibition of apoptosis, respectively. These latter
three genes are frequently up-regulated in cancers (32, 33).8 The
remaining down-regulated genes serve in protein trafficking, and
proinflammatory responses. The RT-PCR validation studies showed
comparable fold changes to those detected by microarray analyses
(Table 2).
Up-regulation of apoptotic and terminal differentiation
genes occurred in a subset of patients. Although consistent
down-regulatory effects were identified, posttreatment increases in
gene expression showed greater variability. Microarray analyses
revealed that a subset of patients’ IEN lesions responded to berry
gel application with up-regulation of proapoptotic and terminal
differentiation pathways (Table 3). The gene panel selected for
RT-PCR analyses therefore included these microarray-identified
genes in addition to genes that had either protumorigenic
functions, e.g., COX-2, iNOS, VEGF, or were associated with
epithelial terminal differentiation. As is apparent from the data
shown in Table 3, there was considerable interpatient heterogeneity
with regard to which genes showed a modulation in expression
and the magnitude of the effect(s). Consistent with the findings of
other investigators (34, 35), data from Table 3 reveals that genes
which showed an appreciable increase by microarray analyses
showed an even greater expression increase when evaluated by
RT-PCR.
Topical black raspberry gel reduces the levels of COX-2 and
iNOS proteins in treated lesional epithelium. COX-2 and iNOS
proteins showed distinct and different intraepithelial distributions.
Furthermore, the relative intensities for both COX-2 and iNOS
varied from patient to patient and treatment status. COX-2
distribution showed an epithelial layer specificity, i.e., COX-2 was
located in the spinous and granular layers, with negligible COX-2
immunoreactivity observed in the basal cells (Fig. 1). In contrast,
iNOS was more diffusely distributed throughout the surface
epithelium and some tissues showed iNOS positivity within the
basal layer cells (Fig. 1).
Seventeen of the 20 matched pretreatment and posttreatment
samples showed a significant posttreatment decrease in COX-2

Effects of a Black Raspberry Gel on Oral Premalignant Lesions

Figure 1. Although the majority of patients
with oral IEN showed a reduction in epithelial
levels of COX-2 and iNOS at the conclusion of
the trial, the extent of protein decreases varied
among patients. The pretreatment COX-2
photomicrograph of patient no. 20 shows
moderate to intense positivity in the spinous
and granular layers, which was markedly
reduced following treatment (88.9% decrease
for patient no. 20). In contrast, iNOS showed
a more uniform distribution throughout the
epithelium, inclusive of basal cell staining,
as is apparent in the pretreatment iNOS
photomicrograph for patient no. 9. This patient
showed an overall high therapeutic response
rate (47.4%), inclusive of a 24.1% decrease in
epithelial iNOS following berry gel application
(all photomicrographs taken at 100 image
scale, using an Olympus BX51 microscope
equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital camera).

(P < 0.005; Table 4). Although a majority (12 of 20) of participants
showed posttreatment decreases in epithelial iNOS, these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.53; Table 4). Finally,
the extent of gel application effects on epithelial COX-2 and iNOS
levels varied appreciably among patients (Table 4).
Superficial connective tissue MVD is diminished in some
treated oral IEN lesions. Based on sample availability, MVD
analyses were conducted on 11 pretreatment and posttreatment
matched tissues. Seven participants showed a decrease in MVD
following gel treatment (extent of decreases ranging from 2.9%
to 67.3%; Table 4). Four of these positive responders, which
exhibited higher percentage MVD decreases [patient nos. 2
(67.3%), 7 (38.9%), 15 (28.9%), and 20 (19.8%)], also showed
decreases in VEGF expression (10, 5.4, 1.1, and 1.8, for
patient nos. 2, 7, 15 and 20, respectively; Tables 3 and 4; Fig. 2A
and B). Notably, the VEGF RT-PCR data from the three low positive
responders (nos. 3, 10, and 14) and the four patients (nos. 13, 18, 19,
and 21) which showed MVD increases (increases ranging from
+7.7% to +44.1%), also showed decreased VEGF expression in five
patients, three of which showed decreases of 2-fold or greater.
These VEGF data likely reflect the contribution of numerous
factors in addition to transcriptional regulation that affects
vascular density.
Summarized data of black raspberry clinical trial reveals a
cohort of ‘‘high’’ responders. The data presented in Table 4
depicts the overall effects of berry gel application on the 20
patients with oral IEN. The corresponding LOH indices data,
which are discussed in a separate report, are included for
completeness (31). Three of the 20 patients (nos. 2, 9, and 12)
showed a high overall therapeutic responsiveness as determined
by a >45% positive response rate. Common features of the ‘‘high’’
responders were decreased iNOS protein (27.7%, 24.1%, and
16.0%), high responsiveness with respect to gene modulation
(9, 6, and 8, respectively), and no increases in histopathology
(two decreased grade and one stable disease). The one high-

www.aacrjournals.org

response participant (no. 2) who had sufficient tissues for MVD
analyses also showed the greatest posttreatment reduction (67.3%)
in vascularity. The uniform features of the ‘‘low’’ responders
(V30% positive response rate, nos. 5, 6, 8, 11, 15, 17, 18, and 21)
were a posttreatment increase in iNOS proteins in five of eight
patients, either no change (nos. 6, 15, 18, 21) or an increase (nos.
8, 11, 17) in posttreatment histologic grade in seven of eight
patients, and modest to low gene-modulatory effects in eight of
eight patients. Collectively, 60% of our participants showed >30%
positive therapeutic responses following treatment.
Follow-up information on clinical trial participants. Followup information regarding study participants (Table 1B) is limited
by the complexion of the patient pool in this regional referral
center. Eleven patients remained as patients of record at Ohio State
and follow-up on these individuals ranged from 3 to 23 months.
Three participants (nos. 5, 9, and 15) have had no recurrences at
the treated site with disease noted at other sites. Three patients
(nos. 3, 7, and 19) exhibited no change in disease status at the
treatment site with two of these three patients (nos. 3 and 19)
developing lesions at other locations. Four participants (nos. 1, 2,
10, and 14) showed disease progression at the treatment site, one
patient (no. 1) developed invasive SCC, and two patients (nos. 2
and 14) developed involvement of other sites. The follow-up
7-month posttreatment biopsy of participant no. 21 showed a
histologic grade decrease at the treatment site.

Discussion
Our results show that application of a bioadhesive 10% FBR gel
to oral IEN lesions showed therapeutic efficacy without the
induction of any adverse effects. These data further validate the
established safety record for the two cross-linked polyacrylic acid–
based polymers used as either the bioadhesive or the gel base (30)
and are consistent with previous human studies conducted by our
laboratories, which used dietary berry administration (27–29).

Histopathology data show variability in oral IEN responsiveness,
with 35% of our participants demonstrating a lesional grade
decrease, 20% of participants showing a lesional grade increase,
and 45% of the patients’ lesions exhibiting stable disease. Although
modest, these histologic response rates are comparable with
previous oral IEN chemoprevention trials (36, 37). A previous study
by Papadimitrakopoulou and colleagues, which evaluated the
effects of 13-cis retinoic acid, a-tocopherol, and IFN-a on oral and
laryngeal IEN lesions, revealed that only 14% (one of seven) of the
oral dysplastic lesions showed partial histologic regression at the
completion of the 12-month study, with 45% (5 of 11) demonstrating either partial or complete regression at the intermediate 6th
month assessment (36). As the rates of histologic regression were
higher in the laryngeal lesions, the investigators speculated that the
more recalcitrant oral cavity lesions had sustained different,
potentially greater, molecular perturbations (36). Similarly, another
clinical trial which evaluated an ONXY-15–containing mouthwash
that targeted p53-defective epithelial cells reported a 37% histologic
regression rate (37).
Microarray analyses revealed a consistent down-regulation in
genes associated with RNA processing, intracellular signaling, and
antiapoptotic and proproliferative pathways. As indicated by the
number of genes affected, the greatest reduction occurred in RNA

processing genes, which could ultimately affect both transcription
and translation (38). Notably, several putative tumor-promoting
genes showed posttreatment down-regulation including heterogeneous ribonucleotide protein A1 (hnRNPA1). hnRNPA1 functions in
diverse biochemical interactions that include an overall regulation
of transcription, augmentation of telomerase activity, and
increased InBa degradation resulting in nuclear factor nB (NFnB)
activation (38). The other tumor-associated genes showed reduced
expression function in integrin-associated cell interactions
(LGALS8), facilitation of chromosomal rearrangement (RNASET2),
and inhibition of apoptosis (CFLAR). These microarray data
suggest that FBR treatment diminishes overall transcriptional
activity, resulting in less biochemically active cells. Indeed,
modulation towards more differentiated, less proliferative gene
expression profiles were observed in a subset of patients following
gel application. As previous oral cavity microarray studies have
focused on obtaining ‘‘signature’’ gene expression profiles of
normal, premalignant and malignant oral tissues in the absence
of treatment, direct comparisons with our study are not feasible
(34, 35, 39). In a recent esophageal chemoprevention trial, Joshi
and colleagues evaluated pretreatment and posttreatment gene
expression profiles in histologically normal esophageal tissues in
29 patients with premalignant esophageal lesions and identified

Effects of a Black Raspberry Gel on Oral Premalignant Lesions

Figure 2. Eleven clinical trial participants
retained sufficient pretreatment and
posttreatment tissues for the evaluation of the
effects of berry gel on MVD. A, seven of the
11 participants showed posttreatment
decreases, with four participants showing MVD
reductions that ranged from 19.8% to 67.3%.
B, pretreatment and posttreatment
photomicrographs of patient no. 2. This individual
showed the highest overall therapeutic response
rate of 60%, including a decrease in lesional
histologic grade apparent in the H&E-stained
sections (pretreatment diagnosis—mild
dysplasia; posttreatment diagnosis—atypia) and
a 67.3% reduction in MVD, as noted in the
pretreatment and posttreatment CD34 sections
(all photomicrographs taken at 100 image scale
using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped
with a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital camera).

modified expression of 15 genes (40). Ten of these genes, which
were associated with inflammation and immune suppression,
showed up-regulation during lesional progression, whereas the
expression of five genes associated with immune stimulation
increased with regression (40).
Our RT-PCR analyses revealed a large interpatient response
range. Provided the outbred human population, heterogeneity
among premalignant lesions, and complexity of gene regulation,
these data were not surprising. Previous studies from our
laboratories provide mechanistic insights as to how FBR could
modulate oral IEN gene expression and induce the observed
downstream effects (19–26). Huang and colleagues showed that a
FBR methanol extract reduced activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation
by targeting mitogen-associated protein kinase pathways including
ERKs, JNKs, and p38K, and also suppressed NFnB activation by
inhibiting InBa phosphorylation (21). Notably, three potentially
protumorigenic genes, i.e., COX-2, iNOS, and VEGF, all have
NFnB-binding sites (40). Furthermore, AP-1 activation is associated
with up-regulation of COX-2 and VEGF (41). Our observed
posttreatment decreases in COX-2 and iNOS proteins, and the

www.aacrjournals.org

reduction of vascular densities, are therefore consistent with FBR’s
suppression of AP-1 and NFnB activation. The methanol FBR
extract also inhibited the activation of a key cell survival and
proangiogenic signaling pathway, i.e., phosphoinositide-3-kinase/
Akt (19). Additional studies, which showed that an ethanol FBR
extract reduced VEGF production and increased the functional
activities of caspase 3 and keratinocyte-specific transglutaminase
in human oral SCC cells, showed FBR’s downstream effects on
apoptotic, differentiation, and angiogenic proteins (22).
The majority of IEN patients showed decreases in epithelial
COX-2 and iNOS proteins following treatment. These data are
consistent with our previous results which showed that dietary
FBR administration reduced COX-2 and iNOS proteins in a rat
esophageal cancer model (26). Questions arise, however, regarding
what extent of decreases are pathophysiologically significant.
Perhaps equally or potentially more important, are the COX-2
and iNOS enzyme levels relative to the reactive species degrading
enzymes within critical cell populations. High COX-2 and iNOS
activities in rapidly dividing cells, such as the transient amplifying
cell population, or in the stem cell pool, have the potential to

induce consequential, tumor-promoting nuclear and mitochondrial
mutations (7, 12). Furthermore, high production of prostanoids and
reactive nitrogen species by cells in communication with the
underlying connective tissue facilitates angiogenesis (7, 12). Our
MVD results did not reveal any clear associations between the
treatment effects on VEGF expression and the corresponding MVD.
These data likely reflect the varied factors associated with
angiogenesis, including multiple VEGF splice variants which may
have varying biological efficacies, translational and posttranslational modifications of proangiogenic proteins, local levels of
proangiogenic factors, and the requirement for activated endothelial cells (42).
The extent of therapeutic efficacy necessary to be deemed a
positive outcome in human clinical trials remains to be defined. A
recent oral IEN clinical trial stipulated a priori that their tested
agent would be considered active if 14.3% of their patients showed
a positive response (43). Our clinical trial results identify a subset of
high therapeutic responders, and also indicated that 60% of our
patients showed a >30% positive response rate. Several factors such
as sustainability and penetration of compounds at the treatment
site and compound stabilization or metabolic bioactivation at the
target tissues all likely affect clinical outcomes. It is also feasible
that an optimized dose or dosing schedule may improve our
therapeutic responses. Our follow-up data, which implies that
longer duration treatment will likely be necessary for patients with
oral IEN, emphasizes the need to identify both effective and welltolerated agents.
Previous oral IEN clinical trials have relied primarily on systemic
agent administration, resulting in some toxicities and concerns
regarding sufficient agent availability at the treatment site (36,

in an oral IEN trial, this study was discontinued after a patient
developed circulating antibodies to the adenovirus vector (37).
Aspects of this current study, i.e., the local delivery of naturally
derived chemopreventives, have modified the oral IEN chemoprevention paradigm. Finally, although this trial should be
considered exploratory due to its modest size and relatively short
duration, therapeutically promising data have been obtained.
