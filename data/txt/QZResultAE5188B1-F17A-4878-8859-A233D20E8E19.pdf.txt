ABSTRACT
High basal or induced expression of the tripartite motif protein, TRIM16, leads to
reduce cell growth and migration of neuroblastoma and skin squamous cell carcinoma
cells. However, the role of TRIM16 in melanoma is currently unknown. TRIM16 protein
levels were markedly reduced in human melanoma cell lines, compared with normal
human epidermal melanocytes due to both DNA methylation and reduced protein
stability. TRIM16 knockdown strongly increased cell migration in normal human
epidermal melanocytes, while TRIM16 overexpression reduced cell migration and
proliferation of melanoma cells in an interferon beta 1 (IFNβ1)-dependent manner.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed TRIM16 directly bound the IFNβ1
gene promoter. Low level TRIM16 expression in 91 melanoma patient samples,
strongly correlated with lymph node metastasis, and, predicted poor patient prognosis
in a separate cohort of 170 melanoma patients with lymph node metastasis. The
BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, increased TRIM16 protein levels in melanoma cells
in vitro, and induced growth arrest in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells in a TRIM16dependent manner. High levels of TRIM16 in melanoma tissues from patients treated
with Vemurafenib correlated with clinical response. Our data, for the first time,
demonstrates TRIM16 is a marker of cell migration and metastasis, and a novel
treatment target in melanoma.

median survival of only 6–9 months historically [2, 3].
Metastatic melanoma is highly resistant to traditional
cytotoxic chemotherapies [3, 4]. New targeted melanoma
treatments, such as BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib
(PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436) [5, 6] offer
higher patient response rates due to specific BRAFV600

targeting [4, 5]. However, disease progression is usually
observed after a median of 5–7 months, highlighting the
need for a better understanding of disease pathogenesis [7].
Combination of dabrafenib and trametinib is now the
standard of care for BRAFV600 patients, with 50% of
patients experiencing a progression free survival of
9–10 months [8].
The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins
are characterized by a RING B-box-coiled-coil protein
domain architecture and have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of multiple cancers, functioning as either
oncogenes or tumor suppressors [9, 10]. TRIM16 has a
role in innate immune function [11] and is secreted by
keratinocytes in a caspase-1 dependent manner, a process
enhanced by interleukin-1β (IL-1β). TRIM16 increased
differentiation markers in keratinocytes and was highly
expressed in basal keratinocytes, but was down-regulated
during the proliferative phase of wound healing [12].
TRIM16 expression was significantly reduced in vivo
during the progression from normal skin to squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), and inhibited SCC cell migration in
vitro [13]. In addition, TRIM16 down-regulated proteinbinding partners, cytoplasmic vimentin and nuclear
E2F1, in neuroblastoma cells [14]. Together these data
suggested that TRIM16 repressed cancer cell replication
and migration. However, the role of TRIM16 in melanoma
is unknown.
The regulatory inflammatory cytokine, interferon
beta 1 (IFNβ1) has been used in the therapy of
melanoma [15]. The human interferon gene region
(containing Interferon-β1 (IFNβ1)) is deleted in numerous
cancers, including melanoma [16, 17]. In melanoma,
IFN-β gene transfer induced cell death in vitro [18–20]
and suppressed melanoma cell proliferation [21, 22]. Both
IFN-α2b and IFN-β1a inhibited tumor growth and lymph
node metastasis in human melanoma xenografts [23]. Of
all interferons, human IFNβ demonstrated the highest
anti-proliferative activity against human melanoma cell
lines [20]. In contrast to IFN-2α, IFN-β bound with higher
affinity to the IFN α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1), and induced
a greater degree of apoptosis in melanoma cells [15].
IFNβ may also have some clinical activity in patients with
resected high risk melanoma [24]. Transcription of IFN-β
requires the formation of the multi-protein enhanceosome
complex [25, 26]. The c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimer was
essential for the formation of the enhanceosome complex,
and hence, IFN-β transcription [27].
We used human melanoma cell lines and excised
human melanoma samples to show that loss of TRIM16
expression led to enhanced cell migration in vitro,
and metastatic disease in vivo. The BRAF inhibitor,
vemurafenib, suppressed melanoma cell growth in a
TRIM16-dependent manner. Overexpression of TRIM16
in melanoma cells up-regulated IFNβ1 and c-Jun levels,
which was required for the anti-proliferative TRIM16
effect. Lastly, low TRIM16 expression associated with

poor prognosis in melanoma patients with lymph node
metastasis, collectively indicating that TRIM16 represents
a novel therapeutic target in melanoma.

RESULTS
TRIM16 protein expression is reduced in
melanoma cell lines
We first analyzed the TRIM16 protein expression
level by Western blotting in 6 melanoma cell lines,
and showed a significantly lower level, compared to a
normal human epidermal melanocyte cell line (NHEM)
(Fig. 1A). The two protein bands at 67kDa and 64kDa
on the Western blot using the TRIM16-specific antibody
represent two isoforms of the TRIM16 protein caused by
differential post-translational modification [12, 28]. The
proteasome inhibitor MG-132 increased TRIM16 protein
levels in melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The
TRIM16 protein half-life in melanoma cell lines, A375
and Mel-CV, was 12 hours and 6 hours, respectively,
compared with more than 24 hours in NHEM and normal
human fibroblasts (WI38) (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. 1B).
To determine whether loss of TRIM16 expression
was also due to DNA methylation, we treated NHEM,
WI38 and four melanoma cell lines with the demethylating
agent, 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), at 30 µM for
72  hours. TRIM16 protein levels were significantly
increased in the four melanoma cell lines following 5-Aza
treatment (P=0.018 for Mel-JD, P=0.025 for Mel-RM,
P=0.011 for A375 and P=0.0001 for Mel-CV), compared
with normal cells (Fig. 1C). TRIM16 transcription
also increased following 5-Aza treatment (Fig. 1D) in
melanoma cell lines (P=0.05), indicating direct or indirect
de-repression of the TRIM16 gene transcription upon
treatment with the demethylating agent.
We next performed DNA sequencing of the
endogenous TRIM16 coding and promoter regions for
9 melanoma cell lines. Melanoma cell lines IPC-298,
MM200, A375, G361, SK-Mel-2, Mel-CV, Mel-JD,
Mel-RM, and CHL-1 were sequenced. We found an
­
E121D missense mutation in exon 1 of IPC-298, in the
B-Box1 domain of the TRIM16 protein in 1/9 melanoma
cell lines (Fig. 1E). The E121D mutation has also been
reported in a publicly available database, catalogue of
somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC), in 1/71 stomach
cancers [29]. In addition, a missense mutation at V123M
was reported among 1/31 primary melanomas.[29] The
B-box1 domain of TRIM protein, MID1, structurally
resembles the ring domain of E3 ubiquitin ligases.[30]
TRIM16 has a 46% sequence similarity with MID1, can
adopt ring domain-like folds and has E3 ligase function in
vitro and in vivo [31], indicating that mutation in TRIM16
B-box1 may perturb E3 ligase activity.

TRIM16 overexpression reduces cell
proliferation and migration of melanoma cells

TRIM16 protein expression is reduced in
metastatic melanoma and correlates with overall
patient survival risk in stage III disease

To determine the effects of TRIM16 overexpression
on melanoma cell growth, we transiently transfected
5 melanoma cell lines with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector
or pcDNA3.1/TRIM16/myc.his expression vector.
Overexpression of TRIM16 reduced cell proliferation for
all 5 melanoma cell lines (Fig. 2A). We next examined the
role of TRIM16 in melanoma cell migration. Knockdown
of TRIM16 using TRIM16-specific siRNAs in the normal
cellular counterpart of melanoma cells, NHEMs, resulted
in a significant increase in cell migration (P<0.001)
(Fig. 2B). Conversely, transient overexpression of
TRIM16 for 48 hours in G361 melanoma cells caused a
reduction in cell migration into a scratch wound in vitro
over an 8 hour period (P<0.001) (Fig. 2C).

We investigated the pattern of TRIM16 expression
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) among 91 patient tumor
samples, representing all clinical stages. A significant
progressive reduction of TRIM16 protein expression
level was found for dermally invasive primary melanoma,
lymph node metastases and distant metastases, when
compared to compound nevi (P<0.001) (Fig. 4A&B).
The most significant decrease in TRIM16 expression was
observed between the dermal invasive melanoma >1mm
stage and the lymph node metastasis stage.
Therefore, we next determined the prognostic
significance of low TRIM16 expression in an independent
cohort of 170 melanoma patients with lymph node
metastases (Stage III). Patients were subdivided into high
or low expression subgroups based on the average value
of 0.995. Low TRIM16 expression in melanoma cells
metastatic to lymph nodes was significantly associated
with poor prognosis [(Hazard ratio 0.6322 with 95%
confidence of 0.4322 to 0.9383) vs (Hazard ratio 1.582
with 95% confidence of 1.066 to 2.314) (P = 0.0255, twosided log-rank test; n = 170)] (Fig. 4C&D). Importantly,
Stage III patients with a TRIM16 expression level >1 had
a median survival of 59 months compared to patients with
a TRIM16 expression level of <1 of only 16 months.
To further elucidate the role of IFNβ1 in melanoma
progression, we performed IHC on the same 91 human
patient samples analyzed for TRIM16 expression. We
found that IFNβ1 protein expression levels were lower as
melanoma became more invasive reaching significance at
the dermal invasive melanoma >1mm thickness dermal
invasiveness stage, P=0.0025 immediately before the
disease becomes metastatic (Fig. 4E and Supplementary
Fig. 3). The relationship between IFNβ1 expression
and clinical stage closely mirrored the patterns seen for
TRIM16 expression. Among a group of patients with
distant metastatic disease, we observed a strong positive
correlation between TRIM16 and IFNβ1 levels (Fig. 4F).

TRIM16 directly binds to the IFNβ1 promoter
and induces IFNβ1 transcription
We have previously shown that TRIM16 can bind
DNA, acetylate histones and enhance transcription of
retinoid-responsive genes [32]. To investigate potential
downstream target genes of TRIM16 in melanoma,
we performed a Cancer Pathway PCR Array using
mRNAs from G361 cells transiently transfected with
empty vector or TRIM16 expression vector for 48
hours (Fig. 3A). The most highly induced gene in the
expression array was IFNβ1 (5.2-fold). A number of
other genes demonstrated more than a 2-fold increase,
such as IL-8, TIMP3, SERPINE1, MMP1 and c-Jun.
We confirmed by RT-qPCR that TRIM16 induced
IFNβ1 and c-Jun mRNA expression in melanoma cells
(Fig. 3B). To investigate whether TRIM16 directly
bound the IFNβ1 promoter, we transiently transfected
G361 cells with TRIM16 plasmid DNA for 48 hours,
followed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay, and showed that both anti-TRIM16 and antic-Jun antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitated the
region of the IFNβ1 gene core promoter carrying the
enhanceosome protein binding site (Fig. 3C and 3D)
[25]. To determine whether IFNβ1 expression was
required for TRIM16-reduced cell proliferation, we
transiently over-expressed TRIM16 in the presence of
IFNβ1 siRNA knockdown and showed abrogation of
the TRIM16-mediated growth inhibition (Fig. 3E). In
addition, we transiently over-expressed TRIM16 in the
presence of c-Jun siRNA knockdown and also showed
abrogation of TRIM16-mediated growth inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. 2). To determine whether IFNβ1
expression was required for TRIM16-reduced cell
migration, we transiently over-expressed TRIM16 in
the presence of IFNβ1 siRNA knockdown in G361 cells
and showed that IFNβ1 was partially required for TRIM
16-mediated inhibition of cell migration (Fig. 3F).

TRIM16 protein is increased with vemurafenib
treatment and is required for the drug action in
melanoma cells
To evaluate the possible therapeutic application
of TRIM16 expression patterns on the treatment of
melanoma, we investigated the effect of the BRAF
inhibitor, vemurafenib, on TRIM16 expression levels.
After 72 hours of vemurafenib treatment at doses of
0–0.5 µM in A375 and Mel-CV melanoma cells, TRIM16
protein expression increased in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5A). We next assessed the effects of
vemurafenib treatment on TRIM16 protein stability using
cycloheximide (CHX) chase studies, and found that

expression by IHC was significantly increased in patient

and 5E).

patients treated with BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and
dabrafenib, indicating that de-repression of TRIM16
expression in melanoma cells is a novel therapeutic
approach and provides new insights into the mechanism
of action of BRAF inhibitors.
Our data has for the first time demonstrated a
novel action of vemurafenib in suppressing melanoma
cell growth in a TRIM16-dependent manner. We
propose that TRIM16 suppresses melanoma cell growth
via the upregulation of c-Jun and the formation of the
enhanceosome promoter complex that is required for
IFNβ1 gene transactivation (Fig. 6). As exogenous
overexpression of IFNβ1 reduces cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis in melanoma cells, restoration of
endogenous IFNβ1 signaling by TRIM16 may enhance
the anticancer activities of exogenous IFNβ1 [34].
Furthermore, combination treatment of recombinant
human IFNβ and vemurafenib may reinforce each other
and promote a co-operative anticancer signal.

DISCUSSION
Here we define an important role for TRIM16
expression in the early stages of melanomagenesis as an
inhibitor of cell growth and migration through its effects
on the melanoma cell expression of the inflammatory
cytokine, IFNβ1. TRIM16 expression was markedly
repressed in metastases compared with localized
melanoma, suggesting that a low TRIM16 expression
level in apparently localized melanoma may predict a high
subsequent risk of distant metastases, thus our findings
have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
The mechanism by which TRIM16 expression is
lost in melanoma cells is presently unknown. Although our
data indicated multiple mechanisms, including promoter
methylation, reduced protein stability and gene mutation,
a much larger analysis of patient samples is needed. There
are currently few good markers which can accurately
predict the risk of metastases in patients with deeply
invasive, but apparently localized, melanoma. We propose
that TRIM16 expression is a good candidate for further
evaluation as a prognostic marker in American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage II or III disease. Low
TRIM16 expression in localized melanoma tissue may
identify a patient cohort who will benefit from systemic
therapy aimed at increasing TRIM16 levels and preventing
metastasis.
Previous studies have indicated that the MAPK
pathway plays a key role in melanoma cell migration [33].
ERK phosphorylation is a key mediator of cell
proliferation and migration in metastatic melanoma.
Interestingly, we found that treatment of melanoma cells
with the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, which attenuated
ERK phosphorylation, resulted in increased levels
of TRIM16 protein in vitro and in vivo. As TRIM16
is stabilized by vemurafenib at the protein level, it is
possible that vemurafenib treatment may alter TRIM16
phosphorylation states or induce other post-translational
modifications of TRIM16 which affect TRIM16 protein
stability, as it has been shown previously that TRIM
16 undergoes serine-threonine phosphorylation and
enhanced protein stability after retinoic acid treatment
[28]. Moreover, we showed that the cytopathic effects
of the successful BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, in
part required induction of TRIM16 expression. This
pattern was mirrored in melanoma tissue samples from

cell viability was determined.

or siControl. After 5 hours transfection, the transfection
complexes were removed and melanocyte media placed
into the upper chamber. Conditioned media was placed
in the lower chamber as a chemo-attractant. Melanocytes
were allowed to migrate for 48 hours before the chamber
was fixed and stained for cell counting.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed
using the Millipore ChIP kit (Merck/Millipore, Germany) with modification to manufacturer’s instruction.
G361 cells were sonicated for 45 min using high sonication and 45 min low sonication in the DNA fragmentation step. Specific antibodies for TRIM16 (Bethyl,
TX, USA), c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Massachusetts, USA
catalogue #9165) and IgG (Dako, Victoria, Australia)
were used for respective protein pull-down. DNA from
the pull-down was purified using the MiniElute PCR
purification kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen, VIC, Australia). PCR protocol
was as follows: 95C: 2min/95C:45 sec, 58C:45 sec,
72C:45 sec/72C:7 min (x35 cycles). Primer
pairs were as follows: IFNβ1 promoter (forward

Scratch wound healing and transwell assay
For the scratch assay, G361 cells were seeded at
1x105cells/6 well plate and allowed to culture overnight.
Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1
expressing empty vector or TRIM16. After 24 hours
transfection, a scratch wound was applied using a pipette
tip and a baseline image obtained. Scratch wound closure
was monitored over a period of 24 hours. For the transwell
assay, NHEM cells were seeded at 2x104cells/transwell
chamber (Life Technologies Australia, VIC, Australia)

run on Criterion Tris-HCl 10.5-14% gels (Bio-Rad, NSW,
Australia). Western blotting used the following antibodies:
polyclonal TRIM16 (Bethyl laboratories, TX, USA), antimyc tag antibody (Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal actin antibody (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA) and anti- GAPDH antibody (Abcam,
NSW, Australia).

Tissue microarray construction
Reference sections of the donor tissue block were
cut, H&E stains performed and the slides marked with a
1mm circle to identify areas of tumor. Triplicate tissue
cores 1 mm in diameter were taken from the donor
paraffin block using the marked section as a reference
and then arranged in a blank paraffin block by a MTA1 Manual Tissue Arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Sun
Prairie, WI, USA). Once constructed, the microarrays
were baked for 30 minutes at 37° C on a glass slide to
even out the surface and fuse the paraffin in the cores
and donor block.

PCR array and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
RNA was extracted from TRIM16 transfected
G361 cell lines using the PureLink RNA mini extraction
kit (Ambion, VIC, Australia), in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instruction. Cancer PathwayFinder PCR
array was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (SABiosciences, PAHS-033A) using an
ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems, VIC, Australia).

Immunohistochemistry of patient tissue samples

PCR of genomic DNA and sequencing

Following Human Research Ethics Committee
approval (Protocol X11-0023 & HREC/11/RPAH/32 and
Protocol X10-0300 & HREC/10/RPAH/530), paraffinembedded tissue blocks of excised human skin specimens
were retrieved from the Department of Tissue Pathology
and Diagnostic Oncology at the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Whole tissue sections from
compound and dysplastic nevi, in situ melanoma, dermal
invasive melanoma, lymph node metastases and distant
metastases were probed with a specific TRIM16 custom
made antibody at 1:500 dilution (Biosource, CA, USA) and
IgG at 1:500 dilution (Dako, VIC, Australia) was used as a
negative control. A rabbit-biotinylated secondary antibody
was used at 1:500 dilution followed by streptavidin-HRP
(Dako, VIC, Australia) and stained by ACE peroxidase
substrate (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA). Samples were
counter-stained with Haematoxylin solution (SigmaAldrich, NSW, Australia). Tissue microarrays of 170 patient
lymph node metastasis samples (in triplicate) were stained
as described above. Samples were graded independently by
two observers, who were blinded to patient outcome, using
a semi-quantitative scale of 0-4, with 4 being the highest
staining intensity and 0 as negative staining. Tissues were
graded at two different sites averaging 150 cells/field to
allow for heterogeneity of staining intensity within the
tissue [35]. The cohort was divided into ‘high’ and ‘low’
staining groups based on the median value cut off and
significance were determined by applying the log rank test.

Genomic DNA was extracted using TRIreagent
(Sigma-Aldrich, NSW, Australia) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instruction. PCR of six TRIM16 exons
was performed using the following primer pairs: Exon
1 Forward (F) 5ʹ-TGGCCGAGCTTCC TCTGGGA-3ʹ,
Reverse (R) 5ʹ-ATGAATGGTCCCCAAGCACTCAC3ʹ.
Exon 2 F 5ʹ-GTGCATTGGGCTCCTTCCTCCTTA-3ʹ,

GCTACCATCAGCAGTTATTTC-3ʹ. PCR product
clean-up was performed using ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix,
CA, USA). Sequencing was performed at the Australian
Genome Research Facility (Westmead, NSW, Australia)
using BigDye Terminator sequencing (Life Technologies
Australia, VIC, Australia).

Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using the student’s t-test or logrank test where appropriate for the analysis. Results were
considered statistically significant with a p value of <0.05.
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
version 6.01 (GraphPad software Inc, La Jolla, CA). All
statistical tests were two sided. The Kaplan Meier overall
survival curve was based on ‘high’ (≥1) or ‘low’ (<1)
staining from the patient median value of 0.995 (arbitrary
units). The p value was determined by the log-rank test
between high and low groups.

Protein extraction and western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
and protein concentration were determined in cleared
lysates using the Pierce BCA method (Thermoscientific,
Rockford, IL, USA). Protein lysate was standardized and
