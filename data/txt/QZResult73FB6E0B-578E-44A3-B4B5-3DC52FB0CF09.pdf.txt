ABSTRACT
Cisplatin (CDDP) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent but resistance to the drug
remains a major challenge in cancer treatment. To evaluate the efficacy of CDDP in
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we found that p22phox was highly expressed
in CDDP-resistant OSCC specimens. Knockdown of p22phox sensitized OSCC cell lines
to CDDP (P < 0.05). Stable overexpression of p22phox augmented CDDP resistance,
as evidenced by the significantly higher IC50 values. This cytoprotective effect was
attributed to the abrogation of CDDP-induced apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation was
increased in p22phox stable lines. However, blocking PI3K/Akt pathway only partially
restored CDDP-induced apoptosis. In addition, the overexpressed p22phox in OSCC
cells exhibited cytoplasmic localization with enhanced perinuclear expression,
consistent with the localization pattern in OSCC specimens. Remarkably, CDDP entry
into the nucleus was severely impaired in p22phox-overexpressing cells (P < 0.001),
and cytoplasmically accumulated CDDP was co-localized with overexpressed p22phox.
This was supported by decreased CDDP-DNA adduct formation and delayed chk1-p53
signaling activation. Together, overexpression of p22phox sequestered CDDP and
caused defective CDDP entry into the nucleus, significantly attenuating CDDP-induced
apoptosis. Such diminished apoptosis was further abolished by p22phox-activating
PI3K/Akt pathway. Our work has suggested a novel biomarker and insight into the
mechanism of CDDP resistance.

INTRODUCTION

In this study, up-regulation of p22phox was
observed in CDDP-resistant but not CDDP-sensitive
OSCC tissue samples. We then hypothesized that p22phox
was a CDDP- resistant gene in oral cancer. To test this
hypothesis, we used siRNA-mediated gene silencing
to evaluate the effect of p22phox expression in CDDP
sensitivity. Two independent p22phox stable lines were
established and their IC50 values for CDDP treatment were
determined. Later, the detailed mechanism underlying
p22phox-dependent CDDP resistance in OSCC cells was
thoroughly investigated. Overall, our results suggest that
p22phox is a CDDP-resistant gene that suppresses DNA
adduct-induced apoptosis by blocking CDDP uptake into
the nucleus and activating PI3K/Akt pathway.

NADPH oxidases are a major source of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production in phagocytic leukocytes
and in many non-phagocytic cells [1]. The phagocytic
NADPH oxidase mediates oxidative stress, contributing
to the killing of the invading microorganisms. In nonphagocytic cells, in addition to producing ROS, NADPH
oxidases can regulate diverse physiological processes
including cell proliferation, differentiation and death.
The phagocytic and non-phagocytic homologs constitute
the NOX family NADPH oxidases with a total of seven
members in human: NOX1, NOX2 (phagocytic NADPH
oxidase), NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1 and DUOX2.
Activation of most NOX enzymes and generation of ROS
require the assembly with numerous regulatory proteins,
functioning as multicomponent enzymatic complexes.
p22phox is one of the regulatory proteins whose major
function is to stabilize the NOX enzymes to which it binds.
This is supported by the studies showing that p22phox
down-regulation results in decreased activity of several
NOX enzymes [2, 3]. Despite being a key modulator for
NOX enzymatic activity, the role of p22phox in cancer
progression is relatively unknown. In human renal cell
carcinoma, p22phox may promote carcinogenesis by
inactivating a tumor suppressor protein [4]. Up-regulation
of p22phox represents a pro-survival, anti-apoptotic
signal in pancreatic cancer cells [5]. Furthermore, there
is evidence that NADPH oxidases are the major sources
of ROS in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [6]. It is
unknown whether p22phox has an impact on the treatment
of OSCC.
Even though long-term exposure inevitably
develops chemoresistance, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum
(II) (CDDP, cisplatin) is still widely used for the
treatment of various solid tumors, including testicular,
ovarian, breast, lung, bladder and cervical cancers [7].
To date, CDDP-based chemotherapy combined with
other chemotherapeutic agents remains the first-line
treatment for oral cancer patients [8, 9]. For example,
CDDP combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) potentiates
the induction of apoptosis in oral cancer cells [10] and
gives improved survival of patients with advanced OSCC
[11]. In addition, EGFR overexpression is involved
in CDDP resistance in esophageal adenocarcinoma
[12], and combined treatments with CDDP and EGFR
inhibitors show enhanced susceptibility to CDDPmediated apoptosis in OSCC cells [13]. On the other hand,
accumulated level of ROS has been shown to increase
CDDP-induced cancer cell cytotoxicity. Interestingly,
there is a report indicating that CDDP induces ROS via
activation of NADPH oxidases in prostate cancer cells
[14]. However, whether p22phox, the major modulator
for the activation of NADPH oxidases, might play a role
in CDDP resistance of oral cancer has to be elucidated.

RESULTS
Up-regulation of p22phox expression in
CDDP-resistant OSCC tissues
To understand the correlation between p22phox and
clinical efficacy of CDDP, we used immunohistochemistry
(IHC) to detect p22phox expression in three cases of
CDDP-resistant and CDDP-sensitive OSCC, respectively.
There was negative expression of p22phox in two cases of
healthy mucosa (Figure 1A and 1E). Moreover, we found
that p22phox was highly expressed in carcinoma areas of
the three CDDP-resistant cases (Figure 1B–1D or Table 1,
patients 4–6), but was nearly absent in those of the three
CDDP-sensitive cases (Figure 1F–1H or Table 1, patients
1–3). Interestingly, the CDDP-resistant cases displayed
cytoplasmic localization of p22phox with enhanced
staining surrounding the nucleus (indicated by arrows
in Figure 1B–1D). It is also notable that, in all OSCC
cases, p22phox was abundantly expressed in phagocytic
leukocytes that either resided in the stroma or infiltrated
into the carcinoma areas. Since phagocytic leukocytes are
the canonical expression sites of p22phox, this helped to
validate the p22phox staining in carcinoma cells. These
results suggested that up-regulation of p22phox might
confer resistance to CDDP in OSCC patients.

Knockdown of p22phox enhances CDDP
cytotoxicity in OSCC cell lines
To examine the role of p22phox in CDDP resistance,
we showed that p22phox was abundant in six OSCC cell
lines but was only moderately expressed in human oral
keratinocyte (HOK) (Figure 2A), consistent with the
IHC results (Figure 1A and 1E). Knockdown of p22phox
expression by siRNA in four OSCC cell lines with
relatively higher p22phox levels sensitized the cells to
CDDP treatment and further significantly decreased cell
survival (Figure 2B) (P < 0.001 in Hep2 and SAS; P <
0.05 in CAL-27 and Ca9–22). These data indicated that

attenuation of apoptotic signaling. Whereas the cleaved
forms of caspase 3, caspase 7 and caspase 9 were
induced by CDDP in the control line, such induction
was virtually abrogated in the two p22phox stable lines.
The cleaved form of PARP, a well-known substrate for
caspase 3 cleavage during apoptosis, was dramatically
induced by CDDP in the control line. However, CDDP
had no effect on the induction of PARP cleavage in the
stable lines (Figure 4B). Furthermore, we showed that
the majority of cells in CDDP-treated control line were
TUNEL-positive, while no detectable TUNEL staining
was observed in CDDP-treated p22phox stable lines
(Figure 4C). Together, these results strongly suggested
that overexpression of p22phox could protect OSCC cells
from CDDP-induced apoptosis.

Overexpression of p22phox confers
cytoprotection against CDDP in OSCC cells
We next confirmed the effect of p22phox in CDDP
efficacy by establishment of stable p22phox expression in
OSCC cells. SAS cells were transfected with a p22phoxred fluorescent tag (DsRed) expression construct and
selected by G418 (2 mg/ml) for stable transfectants.
After one month, two independent stable clones (p22phox
line #1 and #2) were obtained. Both stable cell lines had
higher survival rates than the control line (DsRed only)
under increasing concentrations of CDDP treatment.
Moreover, the IC50 values for CDDP were at least 4.5fold higher in p22phox stable lines than that in the
control line; 19.1 or 25.5 μM vs. 4.2 μM (Figure 3). Thus,
overexpression of p22phox could confer cytoprotective
effect and rescue cell survival against CDDP-induced cell
death in OSCC cells.

p22phox counteracts CDDP-induced apoptosis
through PI3K/Akt pathway
We then asked how p22phox inhibited CDDPinduced apoptosis in OSCC cells. PI3K/Akt pathway was
examined because it is known to transduce pro-survival
and anti-apoptotic signals in cells. There were much
higher levels of endogenous Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt;
S473) in p22phox stable lines, implicating increased Akt
activity (Figure 5A). To determine whether this high Akt
activation contributed to CDDP resistance, we tested
how p22phox stable lines would respond to CDDP in the
presence of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin, SC66
or 3-MA (Supplementary Figure 1). In both stable lines,
CDDP-induced apoptosis was significantly rescued when
Akt activity was inhibited, as evidenced by the marked
decrease in p-Akt and the induction of cleaved caspase
3 and PARP (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 1).
Noticeably, total Akt (t-Akt) levels in SC66-treated cells

p22phox stable lines are protected against
CDDP-induced apoptosis
Because CDDP is known to induce apoptosis in
cancer cells [15, 16], we investigated whether such
effect was attenuated in p22phox-overexpressing cells.
Cell cycle analysis by DAPI staining showed that
CDDP treatment in the control line caused a significant
increase in subG1 cell population (4.66% to 32.23%),
indicating the induction of apoptosis by CDDP. In sharp
contrast, CDDP-induced subG1 accumulation was nearly
abolished in p22phox stable lines (Figure 4A). We
then examined whether this protective effect involved

were also reduced presumably because of ubiquitinationmediated protein degradation when Akt was inactivated by
the inhibitor [17]. Furthermore, consistent with the results
in Figure 5B, the levels of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP
were increased in response to CDDP treatment when Akt
expression was knocked down by siRNA in p22phox
stable lines (Figure 5C). Therefore, inhibition of CDDPinduced apoptosis in p22phox stable lines was, at least in
part, mediated through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

While there was diffuse DsRed fluorescence signal
throughout the entire cell in the control line, the
overexpressed p22phox-DsRed was predominantly
localized in the cytoplasm, forming a ring-like pattern
at the nuclear periphery in p22phox stable lines
(Figure 6A). To confirm this observation, the parental
SAS cells were transiently transfected with a non-tagged
p22phox expression construct (pcDNA3.0-p22phox)
and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy.
Consistently, p22phox expression detected by antip22phox antibody displayed similar staining pattern
around the nucleus (Figure 6B). More importantly, these
findings are reminiscent of those in clinical samples
in which p22phox was intensively localized to the
perinuclear area when overexpressed in the CDDPresistant specimens (Figure 1B–1D).

ratio of Alexa Fluor 488 intensity was significantly higher
in the p22phox-overexpressing cells; 22.31 and 16.58 vs
1.22, P < 0.001 in the stable lines and 8.47 vs 2.41, P <
0.001 in KB cells. More remarkably, the accumulated
Alexa Fluor 488-CDDP in the cytoplasm coincided with
the localization sites of the ectopically expressed p22phox,
including those of the ring-like structure, in both cell lines
(Figure 7A). To evaluate whether accumulation of CDDP
in the cytoplasm would lead to decreased DNA damage
in the nucleus, we examined CDDP-DNA adducts in
p22phox stable lines. Indeed, dot blot analysis using antiCDDP adduct antibody showed significant reduction of
DNA adduct formation compared to the control line when
the cells were treated with increasing doses of CDDP
(Figure 7B). Furthermore, the activation of checkpoint
kinase chk1 and p53, the two indicators of DNA damage
response, was either attenuated or delayed during the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

6-h CDDP treatment period in p22phox stable lines, as
indicated by the decreased induction of p-chk1 (Ser345)
and p-p53 (Ser15) (Figure 7C). These findings suggested
that overexpression of p22phox might block the entry of
CDDP into the nucleus, resulting in reduced formation of
DNA adducts and activation of DNA repair signaling.

DISCUSSION
Although the NOX family NADPH oxidases and the
key modulator p22phox have been implicated in cancer
development [4–6, 18], it is still unknown about their
role in cancer drug resistance. Since NADPH oxidases
are the major source of ROS production, we previously
used p22phox as the marker to investigate the correlation
between ROS and oral carcinogenesis. Whereas there was
no significant correlation between p22phox expression

and oral cancer progression, we surprisingly found that
p22phox appeared to be preferentially up-regulated in
CDDP-resistant OSCC specimens. On the contrary,
there was little p22phox expression in three CDDPsensitive OSCC tissues and in healthy mucosa. These
results motivated us to hypothesize that p22phox was
involved in CDDP resistance of OSCC. We further
tested the hypothesis by in vitro studies. While p22phox
was abundantly expressed in all six OSCC cell lines, it
was almost absent in normal oral keratinocytes (HOK).
Knockdown of p22phox expression had little effect
on OSCC cell survival, but significantly sensitized the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells to CDDP-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, we
noticed that the combined cytotoxic effect of p22phox
knockdown and CDDP treatment was greater than the
sum of their individual effect; for example, in Hep2 cells,
the combined treatment contributed to 60% cytotoxicity
while the sum of the separate treatments accounted for
only 23% cytotoxicity. It is thus plausible that there was
a synergistic, more than additive, cytotoxic effect resulted
from concurrent challenge with p22phox down-regulation
and CDDP treatment in oral cancer cells.
If knockdown of p22phox sensitized OSCC cells
to CDDP, we reasonably predicted that overexpression
4119

Oncotarget

of p22phox should reverse such effect. Indeed, after
establishment of stable p22phox expression in SAS
OSCC cells, we found that the two stable lines became
much more resistant to increasing concentrations of CDDP
treatment. Consistent with these results, the IC50 values of
CDDP in p22phox stable lines were at least 4.5-fold higher
than that in the control line. To further support these data,
we generated additional p22phox-expressing stable clones
whose parental line was Hep2, and then evaluated their
response to CDDP. Cell survival was significantly rescued
under CDDP treatment (10 μM) for 24 h in the stable
clones (P < 0.01) (Supplementary Figure 2). These results
indicate that overexpression of p22phox can enhance
resistance to CDDP, thus protecting OSCC cells from
CDDP-mediated killing. To understand the mechanism
behind the protective effect against CDDP-induced
cytotoxicity, we examined whether cell cycle progression
was perturbed in CDDP-treated p22phox stable lines. The
results suggest that p22phox overexpression might fully
prevent OSCC cells from CDDP-induced apoptotic death,
thus conferring the cytoprotective effect. We noticed that,
especially in p22phox stable lines, CDDP appeared to
induce a severe blockade of S-phase progression in cell
cycle (Figure 4A, middle and lower right panels). This is
consistent with previous reports that CDDP could induce
S-phase arrest as a consequence of S-phase checkpoint
activation in many cancer cell types [19, 20]. Interestingly,
another previous study showed that increased CDDP
resistance might be associated with augmented CDDPinduced S-phase arrest [21]. However, it is unclear how
p22phox overexpression aggravated S-phase progression
in CDDP-treated OSCC cells.
It has been long known that PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway mediates suppression of apoptosis, thereby
promoting cell survival [22, 23]. Indeed, basal Akt activity
was higher in p22phox stable lines, prompting us to test
whether it was this increased Akt activity that counteracted
CDDP-induced apoptotic signaling. By using PI3K/Akt
selective inhibitors and Akt specific siRNA, we showed
significant restoration of the apoptotic signaling in both
stable lines, suggesting the involvement of PI3K/Akt
pathway in this biological effect. Noticeably, Akt allosteric
inhibitor SC66 enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis in
the control line, indicating that basal Akt activity could
contribute to intrinsic CDDP resistance in OSCC cells.
Together, these results are consistent with recent studies
that Akt played an important role in promoting CDDP
resistance in various cancers [24–27]. Still, it has not been
demonstrated how Akt activity might be regulated by
p22phox in OSCC cells. Several lines of evidence suggest
that ROS can promote Akt activation, leading to induction
of carcinogenic effects [28–30]. Furthermore, there is a
report that up-regulation of p22phox resulted in increased
Akt activity likely through a ROS-mediated mechanism
in renal carcinoma cells [4]. However, despite being the
major modulator for NADPH oxidases activation, p22phox
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

overexpression alone had little effect on ROS level in
OSCC cells (unpublished results). More intriguingly,
we also showed that the ectopically overexpressed
p22phox in OSCC cells was largely co-localized with
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Supplementary Figure 3).
Furthermore, previous studies reported that ER stress
could significantly induce Akt activation, contributing to
CDDP and doxorubicin resistance in liver and lung cancer
cells, respectively [31, 32]. These results have raised
the possibility that p22phox can activate Akt through an
ER stress-dependent pathway in OSCC cells. Detailed
mechanisms are currently under investigation.
In Figure 5B, even complete inhibition of Akt
phosphorylation (or activity) by SC66 (right panel) in
p22phox stable lines was unable to yield similar level
of cleaved caspase 3 as in the control line. These data
clearly implied that there was additional mechanism (s)
involved in p22phox-dependent CDDP resistance in
OSCC cells. The unique perinuclear p22phox staining
pattern in CDDP-resistant OSCC specimens (arrows in
Figure 1B–1D) inspired us to investigate the subcellular
localization of p22phox when overexpressed in OSCC
cells. By fluorescence microscopy, we found that the
ectopically expressed p22phox (p22phox-DsRed) was
mostly localized in the cytoplasm, forming a ring-like
pattern at the nuclear periphery similar to that in CDDPresistant OSCC tissues. To rule out the possibility of
protein mislocalization due to the fluorescence tag,
we asked whether the localization pattern could be
reproduced in the parental OSCC cells transiently
expressing non-tagged p22phox protein. Indeed,
immunofluorescence microscopy showed a similar ringlike staining pattern around the nuclear membrane, albeit
along with a rather diffuse cytoplasmic localization.
Furthermore, such staining pattern was recapitulated in
OSCC cells ectopically expressing HA-tagged p22phox
(HA-p22phox) protein (Supplementary Figure 4). Since
endogenous p22phox was present in a much lower level
than the overexpressed p22phox and exhibited a diffuse
localization pattern throughout the cell (Supplementary
Figure 5), we speculated that the more abundantly
p22phox was expressed, the more dramatically the ringlike pattern would form in both clinical tissues and cell
lines of OSCC. However, the mechanism behind the
transition from diffuse to intense perinuclear expression
pattern is at present not understood. To further examine
whether protein localization of p22phox would affect
CDDP uptake and trafficking, we used fluorescencelabeled (Alexa Fluor 488) CDDP to monitor CDDP
distribution in p22phox stable lines and KB carcinoma
cell line transiently overexpressing p22phox [33].
Remarkably, we found that CDDP was co-localized
with p22phox at the perinuclear and other cytoplasmic
regions in both cell lines. Quantitative analysis revealed
that, when compared to the control cells, the average
cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of Alexa Fluor 488-CDDP

intensity was markedly higher in p22phox-overexpressing
cells. It is thus conjectured that CDDP was sequestered
by the overexpressed p22phox and accumulated in the
cytoplasm, preventing the entry of CDDP into the nucleus.
Interestingly, previous studies showed that cytoplasmic
cysteine-rich proteins such as glutathione (GSH) and
metallothioneins could robustly bind to and sequester
CDDP, representing one of the known mechanisms of
resistance to CDDP [34–36]. However, it is unlikely that
p22phox and the cysteine-rich proteins share the same
mechanism of CDDP resistance because of the distinct
amino acid composition and cellular function; p22phox is
no cysteine-rich protein and lack of known detoxification
activity. Nonetheless, there was no direct evidence to
prove how p22phox sequestered CDDP in the cytoplasm.
Whether CDDP was constrained to the cytoplasm as a
result of physical binding to the overexpressed p22phox
has to be investigated. In addition, we studied whether
the sequestration of CDDP in the cytoplasm would affect
CDDP-DNA adduct formation in the nucleus. Indeed,
CDDP-DNA adducts detected by dot blot analysis was
significantly decreased in p22phox stable lines. Since
chk1-p53 signaling has been shown to be activated during
apoptosis triggered by CDDP-DNA adducts [37–39], we
examined whether the reduced adduct formation would
affect the response to DNA damage. Activation of the
chk1-p53 DNA damage response signaling was attenuated
throughout the CPPD treatment period in the stable lines.
Together, these results indicated that overexpression of
p22phox could cause defective entry of CDDP into the
nucleus, significantly inhibiting adduct-induced apoptosis
and contributing to drug resistance in OSCC cells.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first
time that p22phox, a crucial component for NADPH
oxidase activation, modulates CDDP resistance in OSCC
cells. We found that p22phox was highly expressed in
CDDP-resistant carcinoma tissues in oral cancer patients.
In vitro studies demonstrated that overexpression of
p22phox abrogated CDDP-induced apoptosis, thereby
conferring cytoprotective effect against CDDP in OSCC
cells. There were increased levels of basal Akt activity
in p22phox stable lines, which only partially accounted
for p22phox-dependent inhibition of CDDP-induced
apoptosis. Furthermore, fluorescence-labeled CDDP was
accumulated and co-localized with the overexpressed
p22phox in the cytoplasm, which was supported by
the reduced CDDP-adduct formation and chk1-p53
activation. Collectively, despite normal CDDP uptake
into the cells, the entry of CDDP into the nucleus was
severely impaired presumably due to sequestration by
p22phox in the cytoplasm, eliciting a series of downstream
effects including decreased DNA adduct formation and
weakened apoptotic signaling. Finally the attenuated
apoptosis was further inhibited by p22phox-activating
PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby leading to CDDP resistance
in OSCC cells (Figure 8). These data have provided
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a novel biomarker and insight into the mechanism of
chemoresistance in oral cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue sample collection
Three paired CDDP-resistant and CDDP-sensitive
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary OSCC
specimens were withdrawn from Chi-Mei Hospital Tissue
BioBank approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB)
of Chi-Mei Medical Center. Patients who received CDDP
treatment alone (C/T) or together with radiotherapy
(CCRT) and showed no recurrence for at least two years
were defined as CDDP-sensitive, and were otherwise
CDDP-resistant. Healthy oral mucosa was obtained
during dental surgery. The clinicopathological data for the
patients and samples were presented in Table 1.

Immunohistochemistry
After the dewaxing and antigen retrieval, FFPE
slides were serum-blocked (with normal rabbit serum)
and incubated with anti-p22phox rabbit polyclonal
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
at 1:100 dilution for overnight at 4°C. The staining using
streptavidin–biotin complex system and the scoring
of immunoreactivity were the same as our previous
publication [40].

Cell lines and cell culture
Oral cancer cell lines SAS, Hep2, Ca9–22, HSC3, CAL-27 and FaDu were obtained and maintained
as mentioned previously [40]. Primary human oral
keratinocytes (HOK) were purchased from ScienCellTM
Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
maintained in Oral Keratinocyte Medium (OKM,
Sciencell) with bovine pituitary extract (BPE)-containing
growth supplements. HOK at the third passage were used
in Western blot analysis.

Antibodies, inhibitors and western blot analysis
Rabbit polyclonal anti-p22phox and anti-pAkt
antibodies, and mouse monoclonal anti-p53 and antiGAPDH antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against Akt, caspase 3, chk1 and p-chk1 were
purchased from GeneTex (Irvine, CA), caspase 7, caspase
9, PARP and p-p53 were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA), and DsRed was from BioVision
(Mountain View, CA). PI3K inhibitors 3-methyladenine
(3-MA) and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma,
and Akt inhibitor (2E, 6E)-2,6-Bis(4-pyridinylmethylene)
cyclohexanone (SC66) was from Tocris Bioscience

(Bristol, UK). Western blot analysis was performed as
previously described [40]. Quantification of the data was
performed by densitometry.

pDsRed-N1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto,
CA) and then sequenced. For cloning of p22phox
into a non-tagged expression vector, p22phox CDS
was PCR amplified using primer sequences: forward,
5′-CAGATGAATTCATGGGGCAGATCGAGTGGG-3′
and reverse, 5′-CGGTCTCGAGTCACACGACCTCGT
CGGT-3′. The PCR products were cloned into EcoRI/XhoI
site of pcDNA3.0 vector, generating pcDNA3.0-p22phox
construct.

Transient siRNA knockdown
siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA against p22phox
and Akt (siRNA of Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3) was purchased
from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of siRNA,
50 and 100 nM for p22phox and Akt, respectively, was
performed according to our previous protocols [41].
Knockdown of p22phox and Akt expression was verified
by Western blot analysis.

Generation of p22phox stable lines
SAS cells were seeded into 10-cm culture dishes at a
density of 1 × 106 cells per dish. After attachment, the cells
were transfected with 20 μg p22phox-DsRed construct or
empty vector using electroporation (ECM830, BTX). Two
days after transfection, the cells were re-plated in a 10-cm
culture dish with medium containing 2 mg/ml G418. Two
weeks later, the cells were sorted by FACS before isolation
of single colonies. The isolated colonies were seeded
initially into each well of the 24-well plates, followed
by progressive expansion of the cultures in large culture
dishes. G418-resistant stable clones were established

Plasmid construction
p22phox-DsRed expression construct was obtained by
PCR amplification of the p22phox coding sequence (CDS)
from SAS cDNA pool using primer sequences: forward,
5′-CAGATCTCGAGATGGGGCAGATCGAGTGGG-3′
and reserve, 5′-CGGTGGATCCCGCACGACCTCGTC
GGT-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with
XhoI and BamHI, inserted into XhoI/BamHI site of

clones with high p22phox expression (p22phox line #1
and #2) were verified by immunoblotting.

with anti-fading medium (Dako Fluorescence Mounting
Medium) and visualized under a confocal microscope.

Fluorescence detection of CDDP cell distribution

MTT assay

KB cells were transfected with p22phox-DsRed
construct by electroporation. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, the cells were trypsinized and seeded onto
8-well Millicell EZ glass slides and allowed to attach for
another 24 h. The cells were then incubated with Alexa
Fluor 488–CDDP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for
2 h, followed by a brief wash with PBS and fixation
with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at room
temperature. The fixed cells were permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and then stained with DAPI
for 10 min. Detection of CDDP in p22phox stable line was
identical to that in KB cells, except for the omission of
the transfection step. The slides were mounted by antifading medium and observed using confocal microscopy.
Quantitation of the fluorescence intensity was performed
by Olympus Fluoview Viewer (Ver. 3.0 software).

Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density
of 7 × 104 in each well. After attachment, the cells were
treated with various concentrations of CDDP for 48 h.
Cell survival was evaluated by MTT assay (Chemicon
International Inc., CA) based on previous protocol [40].
The values of IC50 were determined using CalcuSyn 2.1
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

Assessment of cell cycle distribution
In brief, 7 × 105 cells were treated with 10 μM
CDDP for 24 h. These cells were then trypsinized, washed
twice with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After
centrifugation, the cell pellets were stained with 2 μg/ml
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Roche Applied
Science) for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. The cells were
analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and the results were evaluated using FCS Express 4 (De
Novo Software, LA, CA).

CDDP-DNA adduct detection

Detection of apoptotic cells was performed using
APO-BrdUTM TUNEL assay kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, 3 ×
104 cells were plated in each well of an 8-well Millicell EZ
glass slide (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After treatment with
CDDP (10 μM) for 48 h, the cells were fixed in 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 min and then washed
twice with PBS. The fixed cells were stored in 70%
ethanol at 4°C overnight followed by nicked ends labeling
reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The positively labeled cells (green fluorescence) were
visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

For genomic DNA isolation of CDDP- or mocktreated cells, 1 × 106 of the cells were resuspended in
3 ml of TE buffer with 0.65% SDS. The cells were then
digested with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 55°C
overnight. Genomic DNA was precipitated by adding
1 ml of saturated NaCl and 10 ml of 100% ethanol (2.5
× volumes) followed by incubation at room temperature
overnight. The DNA (5 μg) was spotted onto a nitrocellular
membrane and incubated at 80°C for 2 h in an oven. The
positive control was made by incubating the genomic
DNA (5 μg) of control line with 100 μMCDDP at room
temperature for 30 min. The blot was subjected to standard
Western blot analysis using anti-CDDP adducts antibody
(1:1000 dilution) (clone ICR4, Millipore, Temecula, CA)
as mentioned.

Immunofluorescence

Statistical analysis

SAS cells (4 × 105) were transfected with the
expression constructs by liposome-based method
(Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent, Invitrogen). One day
later, the cells were trypsinized and allowed to attach onto
coverslips for another 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 for another 15 min at room
temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells
were blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h. Primary antibody
incubation (1:50 to 1:100 dilution) was done at 4°C
overnight, followed by secondary antibody incubation
with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or Texas Redconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution, Jackson
Laboratories) for 50 min and DAPI stain (1 μg/ml)
for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were mounted

The cell survival data were evaluated by oneway ANOVA followed by LSD post-hoc comparison of
p22phox siRNA vs. p22phox siRNA + CDDP and control
siRNA + CDDP vs. p22phox siRNA + CDDP. The results
of cytoplasm-to-nucleus fluorescence intensity ratio were
further analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. *P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant in all statistical assays.
