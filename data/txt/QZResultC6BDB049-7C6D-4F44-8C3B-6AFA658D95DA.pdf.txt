BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is frequently considered in patients with stage II colon cancer who are considered to
be at high risk. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the survival benefits associated with AC in these patients remain largely unproven. In the current study, the authors sought to examine the use of AC in patients with AJCC stage II colon cancer and to compare
the impact of AC on outcomes in patients with high-risk versus low-risk disease in a population-based setting. METHODS: Patients
with stage II colon cancer who were evaluated at 1 of 5 regional cancer centers in British Columbia from 1999 to 2008 were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to correlate high-risk versus low-risk status and receipt of AC with
recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 1697 patients were
identified: 1286 (76%) with high-risk and 411 (24%) with low-risk disease, among whom 373 (29%) and 51 (12%),respectively, received
AC. Individuals with high-risk disease treated with AC were younger (median age, 62 years vs 72 years; P<.001) and had better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0/1: 47% vs 33%; P 5.001). For high-risk patients, AC was associated with
improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.50-0.83 [P 5.001]). However, no significant benefits with
regard to RFS or DSS were observed. Subgroup analyses revealed that AC in patients with T4 disease was associated with significantly improved RFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.95 [P 5.03]), DSS (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.93 [P 5.02]), and OS (HR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.33-0.77 [P 5.002]). For patients with low-risk disease, AC was associated with inferior RFS (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.00-4.79 [P 5.05])
and DSS (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.10-8.23 [P 5.03]). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based analysis, AC was associated with an OS
advantage in high-risk patients, most likely due to patient selection. RFS, DSS, and OS benefits were mainly observed in patients
with T4 disease, suggesting a limited role for AC in patients deemed to be high risk by non-T4 features. Cancer 2015;121:527-34.

INTRODUCTION
Adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is considered the standard of care for patients with stage III colon cancer after curative resection. Early studies of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) revealed a significant advantage with the use of AC in patients with stage III
disease.1,2 The landmark MOSAIC trial comparing FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin) versus infusional 5FU/leucovorin demonstrated a further 4% absolute improvement in 6-year overall survival (OS) with FOLFOX (73% vs
69%; P 5 .02).3 In all these trials, the benefit observed from adjuvant treatment was primarily limited to patients with
stage III disease. Subsequent pooled analyses of stage II trial participants generally demonstrated a trend toward better outcomes with chemotherapy, but none achieved statistical significance.4-7 As a result, the use of AC for patients with stage II
colon cancer remains controversial.
Despite the lack of robust data, the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend that adjuvant treatment be considered in patients with stage II colon cancer if specific high-risk features are present.6 These include perforation,
T4 tumor, suboptimal lymph node sampling, and poor differentiation.6 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network8
and European Society for Medical Oncology9 have similar guidelines, but add colonic obstruction, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and positive resection margins as high-risk features. Although these clinical and pathological factors do not
reliably predict for chemotherapy benefit, their presentation typically bodes a worse prognosis and thus they represent a subgroup of patients in whom the relative magnitude of benefit from adjuvant treatment is the greatest.10 Recent research

indicates that the use of AC in patients with high-risk stage
II colon cancer is significant, with up to 27% of US Medicare beneficiaries initiating treatment.11
Considering that prior findings among patients with
stage II colon cancer were derived from trial participants
who may not accurately reflect the general population, we
conducted a population-based analysis of the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) Gastrointestinal Cancers
Outcomes Unit database to 1) characterize AC use in
patients with high-risk versus low-risk stage II colon cancer; 2) determine the association between adjuvant treatment and outcomes including recurrence-free survival
(RFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and OS; and 3)
evaluate whether patients with particular high-risk features benefit more from chemotherapy. We hypothesized
that a significant percentage of patients with high-risk
stage II colon cancer are offered adjuvant therapy and that
treatment benefit would be most evident among those
presenting with specific high-risk factors, such as T4 tumor or clinical obstruction and perforation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The BCCA is a provincial cancer control program that is
responsible for funding and providing cancer treatment to
approximately 4.5 million residents in British Columbia,
Canada. The agency is comprised of 5 comprehensive
cancer centers that are geographically distributed across
different catchment areas. All centers offer a full range of
quality cancer programs including oncology clinics,
chemotherapy suites, radiation facilities, surgical services,
inpatient units, and the opportunity to participate in clinical trials for the estimated 15,000 to 20,000 new patients
referred to the BCCA annually.
Description of the Gastrointestinal Cancers
Outcomes Unit Database

The Gastrointestinal Cancers Outcomes Unit database
prospectively collects demographic, disease, treatment, and
outcome data for patients who reside in the province at the
time of diagnosis and who are referred to the BCCA for
management. Various clinicopathological factors are available such as age, sex, performance status, tumor site and
histology, date and type of surgery performed, stage of disease at diagnosis, extent of lymph node sampling, details of
systemic and radiotherapy received, and date of disease
recurrence and death. The rate of loss to follow-up is <5%.
Description of the Study Population

All patients who were diagnosed with pathological stage II
colon cancer between 1999 and 2008, underwent curative
528

resection, and were referred to the BCCA were included.
The study time period was chosen to allow for adequate
follow-up and reliable ascertainment of disease recurrence
and survival. Patients with a synchronous or prior colon
cancer, those treated with neoadjuvant therapy, and those
with a histological diagnosis other than adenocarcinoma
were excluded. From this eligible population, 2 study
cohorts were constructed: 1) patients with stage II disease
complicated by either clinical obstruction, perforation,
T4 tumor, suboptimal lymph node sampling (<12 lymph
nodes), presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion, or poor differentiation were categorized as “high
risk”; and 2) those without any of these features were classified as “low risk.“
Definitions of Dependent and Independent
Variables

The main independent variable was use of adjuvant systemic therapy (yes/no), defined as receipt of any 5-FU or
capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin after curative surgical resection. Although we intended to explore the relative benefits of adding oxaliplatin to the standard
5-FU-based regimen, the approval of oxaliplatin in mid2006 meant that the number of patients who were treated
with this agent during the study period was insufficient to
permit a meaningful analysis. The primary study endpoint was RFS, defined as the interval between the date of
colon cancer diagnosis and the date of first tumor recurrence (local, regional, or distant), death from any cause, or
diagnosis of new primary colorectal cancer. The frequency
of new primary colorectal tumors was comparable across
patient subgroups. Secondary endpoints were DSS (time
between the date of colon cancer diagnosis and death
from colon cancer) and OS (time between the date of colon cancer diagnosis and death from any cause). In addition, the following covariates, if available, were analyzed:
patient demographics, performance status as defined by
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), and
various other clinical and pathological tumor characteristics as listed in Table 1.
Statistical Analysis

Baseline characteristics were summarized with descriptive
statistics. Variations between high-risk and low-risk stage
II colon cancer based on receipt of AC were evaluated
using the Fisher exact and chi-square tests for categorical
variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous
variables. RFS, DSS, and OS were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival were
assessed with the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox

proportional hazards regression models were subsequently
fitted to evaluate the relationships between receipt of AC
with each of the outcomes, stratifying by specific high-risk
versus low-risk features.
An exploratory analysis to explore for effect modification based on age (<70 years vs 70 years) was performed given the recent questions regarding the
usefulness of adjuvant treatment in the elderly.12,13 Furthermore, we conducted a series of secondary analyses to:
1) evaluate early events, defined as death within 12
months of adjuvant therapy, as a proxy for treatmentrelated deaths; and 2) explore era-to-era changes (before
2006 vs after 2006) to determine the potential
population-level impact of the introduction of oxaliplatin
on outcomes. Finally, we also assessed time to tumor recurrence as an endpoint by censoring deaths and nonevents at the time of last follow-up. Because this endpoint
did not appreciably change the findings of the current
study, only the main results are presented.
All tests were 2-sided, in which a P value <.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. A complete case
approach was used in univariate models such that patients
with unknown or missing values were excluded in statistical comparisons. In multivariate models, we included specific clinical variables selected a priori (eg, age and sex) as
well as those that were found to be significant on univariate analyses. SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used to conduct all statistical
analyses.
RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics

In total, 1697 patients were identified: 1286 (76%) were
considered high risk and 411 (24%) were deemed low
risk. The median follow-up was 5.3 years. Within the
530

high-risk group, the most frequent poor prognostic features included suboptimal lymph node sampling (64%),
clinical obstruction or perforation (30%), T4 tumor
(27%), lymphovascular invasion (23%), and poor differentiation (18%). Approximately 772 patients (45%) had
>1 poor prognostic factor. In the high-risk and low-risk
groups, 373 patients (29%) and 51(12%) patients, respectively, received AC. Compared with those who did not
receive any adjuvant treatment, patients with high-risk
disease who were treated with AC were younger (median
age, 62 years vs 72 years; P<.001); had better ECOG performance status (0/1, 47% vs 33%; P 5 .001); and tended
to have worse prognostic features, such as perforation
(15% vs 5%; P<.001), T4 lesions (46% vs 19%;
P<.001), and evidence of either microscopic (10% vs
6%; P 5 .002) or macroscopic (1% vs.0%; P 5 .002) residual tumor. Similar differences in median age (57 years
vs 69 years, P<.001) and ECOG performance status (0/1,
49% vs 37%; P 5 .09) were noted in patients with lowrisk disease who did and did not receive AC, respectively.
Additional baseline characteristics are described in
Table 1.
Associations Between Use of AC and Outcomes

In univariate analyses shown in Table 2 and Figures 1
to 3, patients with high-risk disease who received AC had
a significant OS advantage when compared with those
who did not (5-year OS rate of 75.3% vs 69.3%;
P<.001). However, there were no differences observed
with regard to the other endpoints (3-year RFS rate of
78.5% vs.80.4% [P 5 .92] and 5-year DSS rate of 79.5%
vs 79.7% [P 5 .52]). In the patients with low-risk disease,
outcomes for 3-year RFS, 5-year DSS, and 5-year OS
were similar regardless of receipt of AC (84.1% vs 92.5%
[P 5 .12], 87.1% vs 92.0% [P 5 .18], and 82.9% vs
83.3% [P 5 .56], respectively).

Figure 1. Overall survival curve based on high-risk versus lowrisk tumor status and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC)
is shown. Low risk indicates no high-risk features; high risk,
the presence of 1 high-risk feature.

Figure 2. Disease-specific survival based on high-risk versus
low-risk tumor status and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy
(AC) is shown. Low risk indicates no high-risk features; high
risk, the presence of 1 high-risk feature.

Table 3 highlights the multivariate Cox regression
models. In these analyses, AC use among high-risk
patients continued to correlate with improved OS (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.50-0.8 [P 5 .001]). There was also a trend toward better
RFS and DSS (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99; P 5 .05]
and HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53-0.99; P 5 .05], respectively). In our evaluation of individual poor prognostic
factors, only high-risk patients with T4 tumors demonstrated a consistent and significant improvement in all 3
outcomes from use of AC (RFS: HR, 0.63 [95% CI,
0.42-0.95; P 5 .03]; DSS: HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.37-0.93;

or perforation who received AC were also found to have
superior OS. However, the endpoints of RFS and DSS
were similar independent of receipt of AC. The presence
of 2 poor prognostic features with the exclusion of T4
disease was not found to be associated with differences in
any of the measured outcomes. The use of AC in low-risk
patients was correlated with poorer outcomes, including
worse RFS (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.00-4.97 [P 5 .05]) and
DSS (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.10-8.23 [P 5 .03]). Secondary analysis of the low-risk group found that patients who
received chemotherapy were more likely to have early
events (6% vs 2%) and right-sided tumors (50% vs 29%)
than those who did not receive chemotherapy. An era-toera comparison of before versus after the year 2006 suggested that the introduction of oxaliplatin did not alter
these findings.
Given recent evidence suggesting that the benefits of
AC may differ based on age, we further explored for effect
modification by dichotomizing the cohort into elderly
patients (defined as those aged 70 years) and younger
patients (defined as those aged <70 years), focusing on
the high-risk cohort.12,13 Within this group, there were
624 elderly patients (49%) and 662 younger patients
(51%), among whom 85 patients (14%) and 288 patients
(44%), respectively, received AC. In multivariate models,
both elderly patients and younger patients who were
treated with AC exhibited improvements in OS (elderly
patients: HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.38-0.86; P 5 .007]; and
younger patients: HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.51-0.97;
P 5 .03]), but not in RFS and DSS. There were no significant differences noted with regard to the 3 endpoints

Clinical variables selected a priori (age and sex) and variables found to be significant on univariate analysis (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, primary tumor complication, and T classification) were included in the multivariate analysis.

between elderly patients and younger patients (interaction
P values for age and treatment were .42, .89, and .48,
respectively, for RFS, DSS, and OS). Likewise, the effect
of AC on outcomes in the subgroup of patients with T4
disease was similar regardless of age (interaction P values
for age and treatment were .77, .71, and .41, respectively,
for RFS, DSS, and OS).
DISCUSSION
In this analysis, a significant percentage (29%) of patients
with high-risk stage II colon cancer received AC. We
found that use of AC was correlated with better OS
among high-risk patients as well as improved RFS, DSS,
and OS among those individuals with T4 lesions. The
relationships between AC and treatment outcomes were
similar for both older and younger patients, with no evidence of effect modification by age. The findings of the
current study also suggest that the adjuvant treatment of
patients with low-risk stage II colon cancer was not associated with improvements in outcomes.
Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, the subgroup of patients withT4 tumors represented a subset of
patients with high-risk stage II colon cancer in whom AC
was associated with better outcomes, a finding that was
observed across all of the prespecified endpoints, including RFS. Given that the primary aim of adjuvant therapy
is to prolong survival by delaying or preventing disease recurrence, RFS is one of the most sensitive measures of the
intended effects of adjuvant therapy. Unlike DSS and OS,
RFS is less affected by disparities in the treatment of recurrent disease, management of comorbid conditions, and
differential rates of death from competing causes that are
unrelated to cancer.14 Considering that the magnitude of
532

AC benefit in patients with colon cancer is largely dependent on the risk of disease recurrence, our finding that adjuvant treatment improved RFS, DSS, and OS in patients
with T4 disease is biologically plausible, given our knowledge that T4 tumors carry a comparable risk of disease recurrence and prognosis to lymph node-positive disease for
which AC is routinely used.15-20 Conversely, an advantage
in OS only was observed in the overall high-risk stage II
group as well as in patients with other poor prognostic features, such as obstruction and perforation, and in those
with 2 high-risk factors. The lack of concomitant RFS
and DSS benefit in these cases suggests that the improvement noted in OS was likely secondary to patient selection
rather than a direct benefit from AC. Given that there
were a smaller number of patients in each of the other
poor prognostic factor groups, the sample size in the current study may have been underpowered to detect any
benefit with the use of AC in these groups.
Previous studies have attempted to better characterize the relationship between AC and outcomes among
patients with stage II colon cancer.3,7,12,21 The MOSAIC
trial documented a nonsignificant trend toward improved
survival in patients with high-risk stage II disease (HR,
0.91; 95% CI, 0.61-1.36 [P 5 .64]) treated with FOLFOX whereas an analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data demonstrated a
lack of survival benefit from AC in the same population
(HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.15 [P 5 .47]).3,12 In most
of this prior research, stage II colon cancers were either
evaluated collectively as a group or simply dichotomized
into high risk and low risk, even though there is substantial heterogeneity within these groups.3,7,12,17,21-23 Thus,
one of the distinguishing features of the current analysis

Outcomes in Stage II Colon Cancer/Kumar et al

includes our investigation of the effect of individual highrisk factors (eg, T3 vs T4 disease, primary tumor complication vs none) and our assessment of the impact of number of poor prognostic features.
There is continued debate regarding whether age
modifies AC benefit in patients with colon cancer.12,13,24,25 In a secondary analysis of the MOSAIC trial
data, investigators concluded that there were no survival
benefits in elderly patients when oxaliplatin was added to
infusional 5-FU, whereas earlier studies suggested no agerelated differences.13,26 We found that survival improvements observed in patients with high-risk stage II and T4
disease were similar, regardless of patient age. It is important to recognize that the few elderly patients included in
the MOSAIC trial were limited to those aged 70 to 75
years only, whereas a more inclusive elderly definition of
age >70 years was used in the current study. Moreover,
differences in the comparators of the MOSAIC trial
(FOLFOX vs infusional 5-FU) and those examined in the
current study (any AC vs none) may further explain the
disparate findings. Admittedly, the sample size of elderly
patients in the current study who received AC was small
and therefore our findings are also exploratory.
It is interesting to note that there were indications of
worse outcomes among patients with low-risk stage II colon cancer who were treated with AC. This observation
could be a reflection of the side effects that can result from
treatment, which become more readily apparent when
survival benefits are minimal in the low-risk group. Toxicities are not routinely collected in our database, thereby
limiting our ability to explore this aspect in greater detail.
However, our secondary analysis of early events, serving as
a proxy for treatment-related deaths, confirmed that
increased toxicities may in part explain the worse outcomes observed.
Several additional limitations are important to consider when interpreting the results of the current study.
We were only able to compare receipt of any AC versus
none without considering dose intensity. In addition,
decisions regarding adjuvant treatments invariably
involved several personal, psychosocial, and physician factors, all of which were beyond the scope of information
that was available in our database. Specifically, we were
unable to account for confounders, such as comorbidities
and socioeconomic status. Thus, selection bias likely
informed many of the adjuvant treatment decisions and
the inferior outcomes associated with AC. Moreover,
some patient subgroups were limited by small sample sizes
and therefore we may be underpowered to detect more
subtle differences in outcomes. However, these limitations
Cancer

should be viewed within the context of the study’s
strengths, including its population-based nature and generalizability, relatively large sample of patients with stage
II colon cancer, and exploration of individual high-risk
factors as well as number of poor prognostic features on
outcomes.
The results of the current study suggest that
improved outcomes from the use of AC in patients with
stage II colon cancer are limited to high-risk patients with
T4 disease. Other poor prognostic features, such as
obstruction and perforation, and those individuals with
2 high-risk factors do not appear to be associated with a
significant benefit from AC. Recent American Society of
Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines continue to recommend classifying stage II colon
cancer into high risk and low risk based on the same factors examined in the current study, despite uncertainty
regarding the usefulness of such a risk stratification system
that is based solely on clinical and pathological factors.6,8,9
This underscores the urgent need for better predictive and
prognostic models. Studies are currently underway to
explore the ability of molecular tests and multigene assays
that predict the recurrence risk of colon cancer and the
degree of treatment benefit from AC.27-32 Incorporating
such information with already known clinical and pathological factors could result in a more relevant risk stratification system that better individualizes care for patients
with stage II colon cancer.
