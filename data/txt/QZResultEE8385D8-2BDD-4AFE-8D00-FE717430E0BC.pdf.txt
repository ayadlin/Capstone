ABSTRACT
Cancer up-regulated drug resistant (CUDR) is a novel non-coding RNA gene.
Herein, we demonstrate excessive CUDR cooperates with excessive CyclinD1 or PTEN
depletion to accelerate liver cancer stem cells growth and liver stem cell malignant
transformation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we reveal the decrease of PTEN
in cells may lead to increase binding capacity of CUDR to CyclinD1. Therefore, CUDRCyclinD1 complex loads onto the long noncoding RNA H19 promoter region that may
lead to reduce the DNA methylation on H19 promoter region and then to enhance the
H19 expression. Strikingly, the overexpression of H19 increases the binding of TERT
to TERC and reduces the interplay between TERT with TERRA, thus enhancing the cell
telomerase activity and extending the telomere length. On the other hand, insulator
CTCF recruits the CUDR-CyclinD1 complx to form the composite CUDR-CyclinD1insulator CTCF complex which occupancied on the C-myc gene promoter region,
increasing the outcome of oncogene C-myc. Ultimately, excessive TERT and C-myc
lead to liver cancer stem cell and hepatocyte-like stem cell malignant proliferation.
To understand the novel functions of long noncoding RNA CUDR will help in the
development of new liver cancer therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.

important marker whose prognostic value and significance
remains controversy [5]. Moreover, CD44+/CD133+ cells
were enriched with tumour-initiating characteristics [6].
As CD24 and CD133 are enriched within epithelial and
differentiated cells, more elucidations may require to
define potential marker combination [7].
Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding
RNAs have multiple important roles in transcriptional
regulation, and also contribute to the expansion of genome
complexity. LncRNAs can regulate gene expression
in many ways, including chromosome remodeling,
transcription and post-transcriptional processing [8].
Cancer up-regulated drug resistant (Urothelial cancer
associated 1, UCA1, CUDR) is a novel non-coding RNA
gene, which plays a pivotal role in cancer progression.
Patients with high CUDR expression had a significantly
poorer prognosis than those with low CUDR expression.
Moreover, CUDR was found to influence the proliferation,
apoptosis and cell cycle progression of colorectal cancer

INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cell(CSC) population is a subset
of cells capable of dictating invasion, metastasis,
heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance in tumours. CSCs
can be defined as a population of cells present in tumours,
which can undergo self-renewal and differentiation. The
evidence supports the vital role of this subset of cells in
initiation and maintenance of a tumour in addition to their
capability to dictate invasion, metastasis, heterogeneity,
and therapeutic resistance in tumours. It is clear that
heterogeneity amongst tumours and within tumour
subtypes renders it difficult to discover unique markers.
The well-accepted cancer stem cell surface markers are
CD44, CD24, CD133, CD166, EpCAM [1]. CD44 and
CD24 have been used extensively in combination or
with other putative markers to isolate CSCs from solid
tumours [2, 3]. CD44 is considered a potential CSC
marker in majority of cancers [4]. CD24 is another

(CRC) cells [9]. CUDR plays a positive role in cancer
cell glucose metabolism through the cascade of mTORSTAT3/miR143-HK2 [10]. CUDR is a direct target of
CAPERα/TBX3 repression whose overexpression is
sufficient to induce senescence. Intriguingly, CUDR
sequesters hnRNPA1 and thus stabilizes CDKN2Ap16INK. Thus CAPERα/TBX3 and CUDR constitute
a coordinated, reinforcing mechanism to regulate both
CDKN2A-p16INK transcription and mRNA stability [11].
CUDR increases the cisplatin resistance of bladder cancer
cells by enhancing the expression of Wnt6, and thus
represents a potential target to overcome chemoresistance
in bladder cancer [12, 13, 14]. Expression of CUDR
lncRNA was enhanced in tongue squamous cell carcinoma
(TSCC) and may play a role in tumor metastasis [15].
CUDR regulated cell cycle through CREB via PI3K-AKT
dependent pathway in bladder cancer [16]. CUDR is an
oncofetal gene, and its upregulation may be important for
carcinogenesis.
PTEN protein acts as a phosphatase to depho­
sphorylate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
(PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 or PIP3). PTEN specifically catalyses the
dephosporylation of the 3` phosphate of the inositol ring in
PIP3, resulting in the biphosphate product PIP2 (PtdIns(4,5)
P2). This dephosphorylation is important because it results
in inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway [17]. When the
PTEN enzyme is functioning properly, it acts as part of a
chemical pathway that signals cells to stop dividing and can
cause cells to undergo programmed cell death. There is also
evidence that the protein made by the PTEN gene may play
a role in cell migration and adhesion of cells to surrounding
tissues [18]. PTEN orthologs have been identified in most
mammals for which complete genome PTEN is one of
the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in human
cancer; in fact, up to 70% of men with prostate cancer are
estimated to have lost a copy of the PTEN gene at the time
of diagnosis [19]. During tumor development, mutations
and deletions of PTEN occur that inactivate its enzymatic
activity leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced
cell death. Frequent genetic inactivation of PTEN occurs
in glioblastoma, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer;
and reduced expression is found in many other tumor types
such as lung and breast cancer. PTEN deletion mutants
have recently been shown to allow nerve regeneration in
mice [20]. The competition between PTEN mRNA and
other RNAs for shared microRNA molecules has emerged
as one such mechanism. The competing endogenous RNA
(ceRNA) partners of PTEN that have been identified so far.
PTEN-centered ceRNA networks can contribute to a deeper
understanding of PTEN function and tumorigenesis [21].
CyclinD1 is characterized by a dramatic periodicity
in protein abundance throughout the cell cycle. cyclinD1
forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory
subunit of CDK4, whose activity is required for cell
cycle G1/S transition. Evidence has established that

members of the cyclin D1 family function to regulate
phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product,
thereby activating E2F transcription factors. Blockage
of NF-κB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 using siRNA transfection
decreased the carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis in rats.
Macrophage-initiated TNF-α/NF-κB/cyclinD1 and IL-6/
STAT3/cyclinD1 pathways are primarily responsible
for promoting lung tumorigenesis [22]. Flubendazole
(widely used in the treatment of intestinal parasites)
inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation in dose- and
time-dependent manner and delayed tumor growth in
xenograft models by intraperitoneal injection. Importantly,
flubendazole reduced CD44 high/CD24low subpopulation
and suppressed the formation of mammosphere and the
expression of self-renewal related genes including c-myc,
oct4, sox2, nanog and cyclinD1[23]. FOXO3 was vital in
mediating doxorubicin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Activated FOXO3a disturbed the
interaction between β-catenin and TCF and inhibited the
expression of β-catenin/TCF target genes CyclinD1[24].
NTKL overexpression could accelerate the mitotic exit
and chromosome segregation, which could promote G1/S
transition by decreasing P53 and increasing CyclinD1
expressions [25].
In this report, our findings indicate overexpressed
CUDR cooperates to overexpressed CyclinD1 or PTEN
depletion to accelerate liver cancer stem cells and liver
stem cells growth in vitro and in vivo. The abnormal
CUDR-CyclinD1-PTEN-TERT/Myc axis leads to
liver cancer stem cell and liver stem cells malignant
transformation and proliferation.

RESULTS
CUDR cellular localization and transcriptional
level in cancer stem cells, and human liver
cancer stem cells isolation and its malignant
growth capacity
To explore CUDR cellular localization and
transcriptional level in cancer stem cells, we first
analysed the CUDR cDNA full length using 5′-RACE
and 3′-RACE. As shown in the Figure 1A, we found a
1423bp CUDR transcript at least in liver cancer stem
cell. As well as we further identified the CUDR transcript
size by Northern blotting analysis and showed CUDR
was distributed in liver cancer stem cell plasma and
nucleus respectively (Figure 1B). The findings of In situ
Hybridization for CUDR either in liver cancer stem cells
or in liver cancer tissues also showed CUDR was located
in cell plasma and nucleus (Figure 1Ca–1Ce). Specifically,
CUDR transcriptional level was significantly higher in
cancer stem cells than in cancer unstem cells, including
liver cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukaemia and
gastric cancer (Figure 1D).

To compare the growth and gene expression between
liver cancer stem cell and unstemic liver cancer cells, we
isolated the liver cancer stem cells from human liver cancer
cell line Huh7 by CD133/CD44/CD24/EpCAM MicroBead
according to the schematic digram (Figure 1Ea). In the
isolated cells from human liver cancer cell line Huh7, Cells
with CD133+/CD44+/CD24+/EpCAM+(HLCSC) was 15.3
± 5.26%, Cells with CD133−/CD44−/CD24−/EpCAM(non-HLCSC) was 5.23 ± 2.56% and others was 79.43 ±
5.19% (P < 0.01, respectively) (Figure 1Eb). We selected
the CD133−/CD44− /CD24−/EpCAM- liver cancer cells
as unstem cells (control cells). Although Epcam- cells
as the nonstem cell population may exclude most cells
with epithelial phenotype, these cells possess the lowest
stemness. Western blotting showed that liver cancer stem
cells CD133, CD44, CD24 and EpCAM were expressed in
human liver cancer stem cells(HLCSC), as well as CD133,

CD44, CD24 and EpCAM were not expressed in liver
cancer unstem cells (non-HLCSC)(Figure 1Eb). Next,
we examined cell proliferation ability, colony formation
ability, sphere formation ability and tumor forming ability
in immunodeficient mice in the two cell lines. As shown in
Figure 1F, the growth rate was significantly increased in liver
cancer stem cells compared to the liver cancer unstem cells
(P < 0.01). As shown in Figure 1G, the colony formation
rate in liver cancer stem cell group (80.7% ± 21.3%) was
significantly higher than in liver cancer unstem cell group
(42.5 ± 10.1%) (P < 0.01). HLCSCs possessed the higher
sphere formation ability compared to non-LCSCs control
(23.4 ± 6.7% vs 0%, P < 0.01) (Figure 1H). HLCSC produced
the xenograft tumor in immunodeficient mice (0.898 ± 0.138
gram, n = 6, p < 0.01), on the constrary, non-HLCSC did
not form xenograft tumor (P < 0.01)(Figure 1I). Further
on, we detected the long noncoding RNA expression in the

CUDR and H19 expression were significantly increased
in liver cancer stem cell line compared to the liver cancer
unstem cell line. On the other hand, the MEG3 expression
were significantly decreased in liver cancer stem cell
line compared to the liver cancer unstem cell line. We
detected the gene expression in the two cell lines by
Western blotting. As shown in Figure 1K, the C-Myc and
CyclinD1 expression were significantly increased in liver

cell line, however, the PTEN expression were significantly
decreased in liver cancer stem cell line compared to

observations suggests that CUDR may be associated with
stem cell malignant transformation, and isolated human

plus CyclinD1 overexpression, CUDR overexpression
plus PTEN knockdown added up to the greater degree.
However, there is no significant difference among liver
cancer unstem cells(non-HLCSC) groups transfected with
pCMV6-A-GFP, pCMV6-AGFP-CUDR, pCMV6-AGFP-CUDR plus pcDNA3.1-CyclinD1, pCMV6-A-GFPCUDR plus pGFP-V-RS-PTEN respectively. Next, we
conducted colony-formation efficiency assay in these liver
cancer stem cells or liver cancer unstem cells. As shown in
Figure 2Ac, the colony-formation rate added up to 69.26
± 15.31%, 86.98 ± 9.89%, 80.67 ± 12.23% in CUDR
overexpressed, CUDR overexpressed plus CyclinD1
overexpressed, CUDR overexpressed plus PTEN knockeddown HLCSC respectively, while the colony-formation was
45.67 ± 11.23% in control (p < 0.01). However, there was
no significantly difference among CUDR overexpressed,
CUDR overexpressed plus CyclinD1 overexpressed, CUDR
overexpressed plus PTEN knocked-down and control liver

CyclinD1 and PTEN expression using Western blotting
and the CUDR expression using RT-PCR. As shown
in Figure 2Ba, the results showed that CyclinD1
was significantly knocked down in pCMV6-A-GFPCUDR plus pGFP-V-RS-CyclinD1 transfected HLCSC
cells compared to the control, as well as PTEN was
significantly overexpressed in pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR
plus pcDNA3.1-PTEN transfected HLCSC cells compared
to the control. CUDR was significantly overexpressed in
pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR plus
pGFP-V-RS—CyclinD1, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR plus
pcDNA3.1-PTEN transfected HLCSC cells compared
to the control. At the first time, we detected these cells
proliferation in vitro. As shown in Figure 2Bb, CUDR
overexpression promoted the HLCSC proliferation
compared to the control (P < 0.01). On the other hand,
CUDR overexpression plus CyclinD1 knockdown, CUDR
overexpression plus PTEN overexpression did not alter
cell proliferation ability compared to control (P > 0.05).
Moreover, there is also no significant difference among
liver cancer unstem cells groups transfected with pCMV6A-GFP, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR, pCMV6-A- GFP-CUDR
plus pGFP-V-RS-CyclinD1, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR
plus pcDNA3.1-PTEN respectively (P > 0.05). Next, we
performed colony-formation efficiency assay in these liver

in Figure 2Bc, the colony-formation rate is significantly
increased in CUDR overexpressed HLCSC compared to
control (71.48 ± 15.78%, vs 38.71 ± 9.12%, P < 0.01), as
well as the colony-formation rate in CUDR overexpressed

compared to control (39.23 ± 9.23%, 41.35 ± 8.23%
vs 38.71 ± 9.12%, P > 0.05, respectively). Moreover,
there was no significantly difference among CUDR
overexpressed, CUDR overexpressed plus CyclinD1

To address whether CUDR knockdown cooperated
with cyclinD1 overexpression or PTEN knockdown
to influence on the liver cancer stem cell proliferation,
we established the stable human liver cancer stem
cell(HLCSC) lines transfected with pGFP-V-RS, pGFPV-RS-CUDR, pGFP-V-RS-CUDR plus pcDNA3.1CyclinD1, pGFP-V-RS-CUDR plus pGFP-V-RSPTEN, respectively. We confirmed CyclinD1 and PTEN
expression using Western blotting and the CUDR
expression using RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 2Ca,
CyclinD1 was significantly overexptressed in pGFPV-RS-CUDR plus pcDNA3.1-CyclinD1 transfected
HLCSC cells compared to the control, as well as PTEN
was significantly knocked down in pGFP-V-RS-CUDR
plus pGFP-V-RS- PTEN transfected HLCSC cells
compared to the control. CUDR was significantly knocked
down in pGFP-V-RS-CUDR, pGFP-V-RS-CUDR plus
pcDNA3.1-CyclinD1, pGFP-V-RS-CUDR plus pGFPV-RS-PTEN transfected HLCSC cells compared to
the control. We first detected these cells proliferation
in vitro. As shown in Figure 2Cb, CUDR knockdown
inhibited the HLCSC proliferation compared to the control
(P < 0.01). On the other hand, CUDR knockdown plus
CyclinD1 overexpression, CUDR knockdown plus PTEN
knockdown did not alter cell proliferation capability
compared to control (P > 0.05). However, there is no
significant difference among liver cancer unstem cells
groups transfected with pGFP-V-RS, pGFP-V-RS-CUDR,
pGFP-V-RS-CUDR plus pcDNA3.1-CyclinD1, pGFPV-RS-CUDR plus pGFP-V-RS-PTEN respectively (P >
0.05). Next, we performed colony-formation efficiency
assay in these liver cancer stem cells or liver cancer unstem
cells. As shown in Figure 2Cc, the colony-formation rate is
significantly decreased in CUDR knocked-down HLCSC
compared to control (11.12 ± 2.45% vs 41.71 ± 10.14%,
P < 0.01). On the other hand, the colony-formation rate
in CUDR knocked down plus CyclinD1 overexpressed,
CUDR knocked-down plus PTEN knocked-down HLCSC
was not significantly altered compared to control (45.67
± 11.62%, 43.78 ± 7.91% vs 41.71 ± 10.14%, P > 0.05,
respectively). However, there was no significantly
difference among CUDR knocked down, CUDR knocked
down plus CyclinD1 overexpressed, CUDR knockeddown plus PTEN knocked-down non-HLCSC and control
liver cancer unstem cells (the colony-formation was

29.85 ± 7.82%, 32.46 ± 8.14%, 33.18 ± 6.39%, 31.45 ±
6.31%, P > 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest
that excessive CUDR cooperates with excessive CyclinD1
or PTEN depletion to accelerate the liver cancer stem cells
malignant proliferation.

The synergetic effect of CUDR, CyclinD1 and
PTEN depletion promotes human embroyic stem
cell derived-hepatocyte-like cells growth and
malignant transformation
To assess CUDR, cyclinD1, PTEN synergistically
affect on human embroyic stem cell derived-hepatocytelike cells in vitro and in vivo, we first induced the
hepatocyte-like cells from human embroyic stem cells
MEL1 transfected with pCMV6-A-GFP, pCMV6-AGFP-CUDR, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR plus pcDNA3.1CyclinD1, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR plus pGFP-V-RSPTEN, respectively. (Figure 3Aa). ES cells expressed
Oct3, SSEA3, Sox2, as well as hepatocyte-like cells
expressed Sox17, HNF4α, Albumin, AFP. It suggests we
induced the hepatocyte-like cells from MEL-1 successfully
(Figure 3Ab). As expected, CUDR was overexpressed in

plus CyclinD1 overexpression, CUDR knockdown
plus PTEN knockdown, CUDR overexpression plus
CyclinD1 knockdown, CUDR overexpression plus
PTEN overexpression did not alter the C-myc promoter
luciferase activity compared to control (Figure 6F). CUDR
knockdown significantly decreased the C-myc expression
compared to control, as well as CUDR knockdown
plus CyclinD1 overexpression, CUDR knockdown
plus PTEN knockdown, CUDR overexpression plus
CyclinD1 knockdown, CUDR overexpression plus PTEN
overexpression did not alter the expression compared to
control (Figure 6G). Collectively, the observations suggest
that CUDR combined cyclinD1 or PTEN knockdown
collectively increases C-myc expression dependent on
CTCF.

PCR results showed CUDR was overexressed in these
transfected cell lines. Cell growth assay results indicated
that CUDR, CUDR plus CyclinD1 and CUDR plus PTEN
depletion result in the greater incrument of cells growth,
however, this action was abrogated when C-Myc or
TERT was knocked down in these cell lines (Figure 7B).
Although cells colony formation ability was higher in the
cell lines transfected with CUDR (62.4 ± 9.3%), CUDR
plus CyclinD1 (89.2 ± 8.4%) and CUDR plus PTEN RNAi
(88.3 ± 6.3%) compared to control (34.5 ± 4.2%, P < 0.01,
respectively), this action was abrogated when MYC or
TERT was knocked down in these cell lines ((Figure 7C).
Further on, tumorigenesis test showed that CUDR (1.56 ±
0.34 gram, 7.2 ± 1.6 days), CUDR plus CyclinD1 (2.56 ±
0.81 gram, 5.6 ± 1.2 days) and CUDR plus PTEN RNAi
(2.61 ± 0.72 gram, 5.4 ± 1.3 days) results in the greater
xenograft tumors and the shorter xenograft oneset time
compared to control (0.73 ± 0.13 gram, 10.1 ± 2.5 days, P
< 0.01, respectively), however, this action was abrogated
when MYC or TERT was knocked down in these cell lines
(Figure 7D, 7E, 7F). Together, these observations suggest
that TERT and C-myc activity is crucial for the synergetic
oncogenic effect of CUDR overexpression plus CyclinD1
overexpression or CUDR overexpression plus PTEN
knockdown.

DISCUSSION
It is well known that long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are emerging as a novel set of targets for
miRNAs. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) played
important roles in proliferation, apoptosis and invasiveness
of tumor cells, and participated in metastatic capacity of
cancers. In addition to regulating transcription, lncRNAs
also control various aspects of post-transcriptional
mRNA processing [26]. Our studies are now indicated to
evaluate the effects of CUDR combined with CyclinD1
and PTEN depletion in liver cancer stem or liver stem
cells (figure 8). Our present findings clearly demonstrate
that overexpressed CUDR cooperates to overexpressed
CyclinD1 or PTEN depletion to accelerate liver cancer
stem cells, liver stem cells malignant transformation
and growth in vitro and in vivo. The synergetic effect of
CUDR, CyclinD1 and PTEN depletion is partly based on
the upregulation of C-myc and TERT. Obviously, this is a
new linkage of CUDR-CyclinD1-PTEN-TERT/C-myc in
human liver cancer stem cells or liver stem cells.
It is worth mentioning that CUDR is a oncogenic
long noncoding RNA and play an important role in the
occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this report, we
focused mainly on the view that CUDR plus CyclinD1
or CUDR plus PTEN depletion results in stronger
oncogenic function in liver cancer stem cells and liver
stem cells. Actually, our observations are consistent with
these previous reports. For examples, CUDR promotes

TERT and C-myc activity is crucial for the
synergetic oncogenic effect of CUDR, CyclinD1
and PTEN knockdown
To further confirm the synergetic oncogenic effect
of CUDR, CyclinD1 and PTEN depletion is related
to the TERT and C-myc, we performed the rescued
experiment of carcinogenesis in stable liver cancer stem
cells transfected with pCMV6-A-GFP, pCMV6-AGFP-CUDR, pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR plus pcDNA3.1CyclinD1, pCMV6-A- GFP-CUDR plus pGFP-V-RSPTEN, pCMV6-A- GFP-CUDR plus pGFP-V-RS-C-myc,

plus pcDNA3.1-CyclinD1 plus pGFP-V-RS-TERT,
pCMV6-A-GFP-CUDR plus pGFP-V-RS-PTEN plus

CUDR was overexpressed in transfected groups compared
to the control. As shown in Figure 7A, the western blotting
analysis showed CyclinD1 was overexpressed and PTEN,
MYC, TERT were respectively kinocked down, and RT-

overexpression and PTEN depletion promotes liver cancer stem cells and liver stem cells malignant transformation

H19 increases the binding of TERT to TERC, while reducing the combination of TERT with TERRA, thus enhancing the cell telomerase
activity and extending the telomere length. On the other hand, insulator CTCF recruits the CUDR-CyclinD1 complx to form the composite
CUDR-CyclinD1-insulator CTCF complex which loads onto the C-myc gene promoter region, increasing the outcome of oncogene C-myc.
In short, excessive TERT and C-myc lead to liver cancer stem cells and liver stem cells malignant proliferation.

Ultimatly, excessive TERT and C-myc lead to liver cancer
stem cell malignant transformation and proliferation.
Strikingly, although CUDR promotes liver stem cell
malignant transformation only, CUDR plus CyclinD1
or CUDR plus PTEN depletion results in a stronger
oncogenic function. We confer PTEN may inhibits CUDR
cooperation with CyclinD1. Evidently, it is the results
that the synergetic effect of long noncoding RNA CUDR,
CyclinD1 and PTEN depletion promotes human liver
cancer stem cell proliferation and triggers human liver
stem cell growth and malignant transformation. According
to the aforementioned findings and reorts, it is thus clear
that CUDR overexpression combined with CyclinD1
overexpression and PTEN knockdown possesses a strong
carcinogenic ability.
These findings are noteworthy that CUDR,
cyclinD1, PTEN depletion synergistically enhances H19
expression. There is plenty of evidence that H19 acts as an
oncogene. H19 is expressed at high levels in adrenocortical
neoplasms, choriocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas,
bladder cancers, ovarian serous epithelial cancers, head
and neck carcinomas, endometrial cancer, breast cancer,
acute T cell leukemia/lymphoma, Wilms’ tumor, testicular
germ cell cancer, esophageal cancer and lung cancer
[28, 29, 30, 31]. Overexpression of H19 appears to be
important in the development of breast cacer, liver cancer,
lung cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal and colorectal
cancer cells [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. The epigenetic regulation
of imprinted genes by monoallelic DNA methylation of
either maternal or paternal alleles is critical for embryonic
growth and development [37]. Moreover, Histone H1.3
overexpression leads to increased occupancy of H1.3 at
the H19 regulator region encompassing the imprinting
control region (ICR), concomitant with increased DNA
methylation and reduced occupancy of the insulator
protein CTCF at the ICR. H1.3 dramatically inhibits
H19 expression, which contributes to the suppression
of epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis [38]. Although
the increment of H19 may partly contribute to CUDR
medicated promotion of liver cancer stem cells, liver
stem cells growth, our findings in this study provide
novel evidence for an active role of H19. This assertion is
based on several observations: (1) CUDR overexpression,
cyclinD1 overexpression, PTEN depletion collectively
govern telomere activity and length through H19 in liver
stem cells. (2) H19 promotes the interplay between TERT
and TERC and reduce the interplay between TERT and
TERRA which activated the telomerase and increased
the telomere length. (3) TERT knockdown abrogated the
oncogenic function of CUDR combined with CyclinD1
or CUDR combined with PTEN depletion. (4) TERT and
C-myc activity is crucial for the synergetic oncogenic
effect of CUDR, CyclinD1 and PTEN depletion.
It has been confirmed that HCCs expressing
“stemness”-related proteins are characterized by increased

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

telomere length, increased expression of hTERT and
shelterin complex proteins, and increased chromosomal
instability compared to conventional HCCs [39]. The
telomeric long noncoding RNA Telomeric repeatcontaining RNA (TERRA) has been implicated in
modulating the structure and processing of deprotected
telomeres. TERRA upregulation is occurring upon
depletion of TRF2 at all transcribed telomeres. TERRA
associates with SUV39H1 H3K9 histone methyltransferase,
which promotes accumulation of H3K9me3 at damaged
telomeres and end-to-end fusions [40]. TERRA is
important for telomere regulation. TERRA G-quadruplex
structure is critical for binding to telomeres [41]. Strikingly,
a repression is observed on TRF2 through the binding
of a TERRA-like RNA molecule to the N-terminus of
TRF2[42].
On the other hand, our data suggest that CUDR
combined cyclinD1 or PTEN depletion collectively
increases C-myc expression dependent on CTCF.
Cohesin co-localizes with CCCTC binding factor
(CTCF), a zinc finger protein implicated in multiple
gene regulatory events. At the imprinted IGF2-H19
locus, CTCF plays an important role in organizing
allele-specific higher-order chromatin conformation
and functions as an enhancer blocking transcriptional
insulator. Cohesin-dependent, higher-order chromatin
conformation of the locus exists in both G1 and G2
phases of the cell cycle and is therefore independent
of cohesin’s function in sister chromatid cohesion
[43]. Current epigenomics approaches have facilitated
the genome-wide identification of regulatory elements
based on chromatin features and transcriptional regulator
binding and have begun to map long-range interactions
between regulatory elements and their targets. Speciesspecific transposable elements may influence such
interactions by remodeling the CTCF binding repertoire
[44, 45]. Some findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin
are integral components of most human subtelomeres,
and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription
and telomere end protection [46]. A role for CTCF
and cohesin in subtelomere chromatin organization,
TERRA transcription, and telomere end protection [46].
CTCF binds to multiple imprinted loci and is required
for proper imprinted expression at the H19/Igf2 locus
[47]. It is evident that activation of C-Myc may play
an important role in CUDR oncogenic action in liver
cancer stem cells. Our findings in this study provide
novel evidence for an active role of C-myc in CUDRmediated promotion of liver cancer stem cell growth.
This assertion is based on several observations: (1)
CUDR combined with CyclinD1, CUDR combined with
PTEN depletion enhanced the C-myc expression; (2)
C-myc knockdown abrogated the oncogenic function
of CUDR combined with CyclinD1, CUDR combined
with PTEN depletion; (3) C-myc activity is crucial for

the synergetic oncogenic effect of CUDR overexpression
plus CyclinD1 overexpression or CUDR overexpression
plus PTEN depletion.
To our knowledge, we first proved that CUDR exerts
its oncogenic effect in part through the upregulation and
activation of TERT and C-myc. Our present approaches
provided an unequirocal evidence for critical oncogenic
roles of the CUDR in liver cancer stem cells, liver stem
cells and supported the notion that CUDR may be an
alternative bona fide promoting factor of liver stem
cells malignant transformation. However, we have
fully not understood the accuracy mechanism of CUDR
combined CyclinD1 and PTEN, such as, how CUDR
works together CyclinD1 or PTEN? What are the partners
of CUDR during genes regulation and control? In this
report, we focused mainly on the view that CUDR
overexpression combined with CyclinD1 overexpression
or PTEN depletion promotes liver stem cells malignant
by activating TERT dependent on H19 and upregulating
C-myc by CTCF mediated DNA looping. In conclusions,
our present findings open the possibility that targeting
CUDR, CyclinD1 and upregulating PTEN might prove
to be an alternative therapeutic strategy. It will produce
an important implication for treatment and diagnosis of
hepatocarcinoma.

Human ES cell line MEL-1 could efficiently
generate definitive endoderm (DE) tissue by treating
the the modified cultures with high concentrations of
the TGFβ family ligand activin A (100 ng/ml, R and

and ethylation analysis by MspI plus BamHI digestion.

Cells were cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde
(Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature and stopped with
125 mM glycine for 5 min. Crossed-linked cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in
lysis buffer, and sonicated for 8–10 min in a SONICS
VibraCell to generate DNA fragments with an average
size of 500 bp or so. Chromatin extracts were diluted
5-fold with dilution buffer, pre-cleared with Protein-A/GSepharose beads, and immunoprecipitated with specific
antibody on Protein-A/G-Sepharose beads. After washing,
elution and de-cross-linking, the ChIP DNA was detected
by either traditional PCR (30 cycles) and PCR products
were run on a 2% agarose gel.

sample on the slide can be covered with a cover slip to
prevent evaporation. Stringency washes: Wash 1: 50%
formamide / 2 x SSC (3 x for 5 min, 37–45°C). Wash
2: 0.1–2 x SSC3 x for 5 min, 25°C to 75°C. Wash twice
in MABT (maleic acid buffer containing Tween 20) for
30 min at room temperature. Dry the slides. Transfer to
a humidified chamber and add 200 μl blocking buffer
to each section (MABT + 2% BSA, milk or serum).
Block for 1 to 2 hours, at room temperature. Drain
off the blocking buffer. Add the anti-DIG antibody at
the required dilution in blocking buffer. Wash slides
5 times with MABT, 10 min for each wash, at room
temperature. For culture cells, following three washes,
slides were then incubated with FITC-secondary
antibody for 60 min at 37°C or 4°C overnight. For tissue
section, following three washes, SABC-DAB staining
was performed.

Super-EMSA(gel-shift)
Cells were washed and scraped in ice-cold PBS
to prepare nuclei for electrophoretic gel mobility shift

Cells sphere formation ability assay
Cells were collected and washed to remove serum,
then suspended in serum-free DMEM/F12 supplemented
with 20 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor
(hrEGF), 10 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast
growth factor (hrbFGF), 2% B27 supplement without
vitamin A, 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). The cells were subsequently cultured in ultra low
attachment 6-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA)
at a density of no more than 5,000 cells/well. The spheres
were collected by gentle centrifugation, then dissociated
with trypsin-EDTA and mechanically disrupted with a
