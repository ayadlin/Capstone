Abstract
Inherent cancer phenotypes that are independent of fluctuating cross-talk with the surrounding tissue matrix are highly
desirable candidates for targeting tumor cells. Our novel study
design uses epithelial cell lines derived from low versus high
histologic grade primary breast cancer to effectively diminish
the breadth of transient variability generated within the tumor
microenvironment of the host, revealing a ‘‘paracrine-independent
expression of grade-associated’’ (PEGA) gene signature. PEGA
members extended beyond ‘‘proliferation-driven’’ signatures
commonly associated with aggressive, high-grade breast
cancer. The calcium-binding protein S100P was prominent
among PEGA genes overexpressed in high-grade tumors.
A three-member fingerprint of S100P-correlated genes, consisting of GPRC5A, FXYD3, and PYCARD, conferred poor
outcome in multiple breast cancer data sets, irrespective of
estrogen receptor status but dependent on tumor size (P < 0.01).
S100P silencing markedly diminished coregulated gene transcripts and reversed aggressive tumor behavior. Exposure to
pathway-implicated agents, including the calmodulin inhibitor
N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, phenothiazine, and chlorpromazine, resulted in rapid apoptotic cell
death in high-grade tumor cells resistant to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. This is the first comprehensive study
describing molecular phenotypes intimately associated with
histologic grade whose expression remains relatively fixed
despite an unavoidably changing environment to which tumor
cells are invariably exposed. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7826–34]

Introduction
It has long been known that the microscopic appearance and
arrangement of tumor cells, defined as histologic grade, holds key
information about malignant behavior and patient outcome.
Criteria for the widely used Scarff-Bloom-Richardson system of
grading and its modification by Elston and Ellis (1) subclassify
primary breast cancer into low-grade or well-differentiated tumors
(grade 1), intermediate-grade or moderately differentiated tumors
(grade 2), and high-grade or poorly differentiated tumors (grade 3).

High-grade tumors (HTG) result in early treatment failures, whereas
low- and intermediate-grade tumors recur after longer time intervals, independently of clinical stage (2–4), with the exception of
medullary carcinomas, which display HTG and have a relatively
favorable prognosis (5). The 10-year survival is reduced from 76% for
patients with grade l to 39% for those with grade 3 tumors (6). Based
on the microscopic evidence of a striking proliferative differential,
conventional systemic chemotherapy exploits the higher mitotic
index of HTG. However, the effects of such drugs on nonmalignant
tissues and organ systems are undesirable and often intolerable.
Additionally, therapeutic resistance is a major obstacle in achieving
complete response. Current research strives to address these deficiencies through the identification of molecular markers at diagnostic presentation, which predict long-term efficacy of systemic
therapy in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.
In this regard, gene expression profiles offer the scope and sensitivity to unveil aberrant changes underlying tumor aggressiveness
and therapeutic vulnerability. A critical limitation in the clinical
translation of such phenotypes, displayed as a single snapshot in
time, includes the incorporation of transient, localized stromal
influences within the afflicted tissue. Although differentially expressed signatures, such as the ‘‘grade gene index,’’ have contributed toward improving grade-based subclassification (7–9), due to
inordinate proliferative differences between the sample classes,
functional insights required for tumor targeting remain limited. We
have implemented an approach, which overrides the proliferative
differential between tumor cells of varying histologic grade, thereby
revealing additional functional phenotypes that contribute collectively to the biological basis of this key clinical parameter. Technical roadblocks that have previously persisted in the execution of
this goal include maintenance of pristine, continuously proliferating epithelial cell populations from the full spectrum of primary
breast cancer. Even when isolated from fresh tumor tissue, such
malignant populations routinely display a finite in vitro life span in
contrast to the common belief that cell immortalization is an
inevitable consequence of tumorigenesis. On the other hand, rare
spontaneously immortalized breast cancer cell lines have originated exclusively from metastatic or high-grade primary carcinoma
(10–16). To provide a representation of the histologic and clinical
heterogeneity of human breast disease, we have used experimental
models of early and late clinical stage, and low-, intermediate-, and
high-grade primary breast tumors (17–21), and more recently of
nonmalignant high-risk breast tissue (22), developed through
incremental improvements in selective cell isolation, short-term
propagation, genotypic and phenotypic characterization, and immortalization. This study describes the molecular profiles of clinically
based novel cellular models of low- and intermediate-grade primary
breast cancer, as yet unavailable in the field. It uses these toward the

identification of a constitutively expressed gene signature to facilitate an understanding of the functional biology of histologic grade
for application in drug discovery efforts. A practical application of
the tumor biology revealed through this innovative approach is
exemplified by the in vitro recapitulation of differential S100P expression associated with tumor grade, its role in clinical stratification
with novel coregulated gene fingerprints, and in the functional
verification of predictive target response to pathway-guided therapy.

three independent runs. Apoptotic cell fractions were analyzed 48 h after
transfection using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide kit (MBL International) followed by FACScan analysis as described above.

Drug Response
Cells were plated at a density of 200,000 per well in a six-well plate and,
24 h later, treated with 200 Amol/L cisplatin, 10 Amol/L chlorpromazine, or
N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (also known as W7;
Sigma) for 24 h. Cells were then stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and analyzed by FACScan as above.

Materials and Methods

Migration Assay

Tissue Culture, RNA Isolation, and Microarrays
Epithelial cultures were derived from clinical primary breast cancer
specimens under Institutional Review Board–approved guidelines as previously described (18, 19). For cell immortalization, 16 independent cases
were transduced with the hTERT gene as described (21). RNA isolated from
subconfluent cultures of the immortalized cell lines was subjected to routine
quality control measures and hybridized to the HG-U133A chip (Affymetrix)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Affymetrix software was used for
image analysis and probe quantification to generate CEL files. Data collection
and analysis are as described by Chin and colleagues (23). For quantitative
real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized and
analyzed as before (21) by an Applied Biosystems 5700 Sequence Detection
System. For primer sequences, see Supplementary Table S1.
S100P was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection of the
sense strand sequence 5¶-ACAAGGAUGCCGUGGAUAA-3¶ (Dharmacon Research) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). siCONTROL nontargeting
siRNA#1 served to evaluate off-target effects. S100P expression was normalized to that of the reference gene ACTB to control for differences in the
amount and/or quality of total RNA isolated from different cell pellets.

Immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis
Expression of S100P protein in tumor cell lines was measured by indirect
immunofluorescence of a mouse monoclonal primary antibody to S100P
(BD Biosciences) and detection with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary
antibody (Invitrogen).
To measure growth rate after S100P knockdown, starting on day 4 after
transfection with S100P siRNA or siCONTROL, triplicate sets of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)–incorporated cell suspensions were immunostained
with anti-BrdUrd, acquired by FACScan (BD Biosciences), and analyzed
using CellQuest Pro software. Ten thousand cells were acquired in each of

Cells were placed in inserts with hanging geometry (Becton Dickinson) in
six-well plates and allowed 4 d for migration through the 8-Am pores in the
polyester membrane bottom of the insert. Inserts were removed, and
migrated cells in the plate bottom were propagated as colonies for an
additional 4 d, fixed, stained with crystal violet, and counted. Migration
potential was determined by the number of colonies at the end of the
experiment divided by the number of cells initially seeded in the insert.
Coculture of primary tumor cell lines and fibroblasts was set up in a
similar format with the exception that the insert pore size was reduced to
0.4 Am. Tumor cell RNA was isolated after 3 d of continuous coculture.

Statistical Analysis
Further analyses of annotated and filtered data were based on 6,053
probe sets that displayed z2-fold variation across low-grade versus highgrade primary breast cancer cell lines. Validation of the array data as
described below follows published guidelines (24).
Paracrine-independent expression of grade-associated signature.
We used the R program samr [significance analysis of microarrays (SAM);
ref. 25] to select genes whose expression levels were significantly correlated
with the pathologist-assigned histologic grade of the tumor tissue from
which each of the cell lines was derived. The initial comparison included
three grade 1 versus four grade 3 cell lines. Setting the samr parameter y equal
to 0.35 gave a false discovery rate of 1.19% for 105 induced and 0.79% for
536 repressed probe IDs. The expression pattern associated with high-grade
cells was designated as the paracrine-independent expression of gradeassociated (PEGA) gene signature. The validity of the association between cell
culture–based PEGA genes and histologic grade of patient tumors was tested
on data sets mentioned below. Using a hierarchical tree program in
conjunction with the top 10 induced and 10 repressed PEGA probe IDs, falsepositive and false-negative rates were calculated to show agreement between
true grade and the PEGA classifier-based grade assignment in published

cancer data sets. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for recurrence-free survival
(RFS) were computed from follow-up data in these data sets.
S100P-COR. Genes specifically associated with S100P in primary tumor
cell lines in the 95th percentile (most correlated) or in the 5th percentile
(most anticorrelated) were identified. For tumor tissue data, using a
criterion of 0.3 or greater correlation with S100P, genes common to two data
sets were identified. Both gene lists were evaluated for enriched Gene
Ontology terms. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compute RFS in these
data sets. The statistical significance of the resultant hazard ratios was
determined by the P value of the likelihood ratio test.
Patient array data sets. The following publicly available primary
breast cancer microarray data sets matching our array platform were

Autonomous Gene Expression Profile of Breast Cancer

into tertiles: blue, low; red, intermediate; green, high. Log-normalized data values for each group: low risk, 3.0 to 7.07; intermediate risk, 7.08 to 9.46; high risk, 9.47 to

Results
An autonomously regulated profile represented by PEGA
genes. Fourteen independent primary breast tumor cell cultures of
known histologic grade (and 2 additional cell lines from ungraded
primary breast tumors) were isolated and immortalized with
hTERT transduction in a single step. These are designated as
the CCdl series (Table 1). Morphologically, epithelial cultures
originating from HTG were distinct from those of low tumor grade
(LTG) even after the emergence of homogeneous, immortalized
cell populations (Fig. 1A). The new tumor cell lines were rigorously
authenticated by direct comparison with the patient’s constitutive
genotype obtained from nonmalignant tissue DNA (data not
shown).
Global gene expression data of the CCdl lines were combined
with that of 51 previously established breast epithelial cell lines and
examined by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Three of four
HTG CCdl cell lines were well integrated with other known HTGderived tumor cell lines of a putative luminal molecular subtype.
The remaining 13 cell lines, representing 3 LTG, 7 intermediate
tumor grade (ITG), 1 HTG, and 2 ungraded cases, clustered apart in
a distinct subgroup, suggesting the presence of attributes that
distinguish them from the malignant and nonmalignant breast
epithelial cell lines represented in the two major clusters (Fig. 1B).
SAM of HTG (n = 4) and LTG (n = 3) CCdl tumor cell line data

www.aacrjournals.org

identified 641 differentially expressed (105 induced and 536
repressed in HTG) probe IDs, designated as the PEGA signature.
Toward minimizing the effect of background noise, a SAMdefined classifier based on the top 10 induced and 10 repressed (in
high-grade cultures) PEGA probe IDs (Fig. 1C, left) was used to
confirm association with pathologist-designated histologic grade in
clinical breast cancer samples. This PEGA classifier achieved 95%
correct classifications for grade 1 (LTG) and grade 3 (HTG) in two
independent breast cancer data sets (Fig. 1C, middle). In comparison, an arbitrary classifier based on marginal relative frequencies
of the two grades provided only 42% correct classifications. Remarkably, grade-associated expression profiles of both HTG and LTG cell
cultures were maintained despite the induction of cell immortalization.
To ascertain the absence of a significant effect induced by stromal
fibroblasts on PEGA profiles, gene expression was measured in both
HTG and LTG cell lines cocultured with one or more independent
samples of tumor-derived fibroblasts. Principal component analysis
based on the top 10 PEGA genes (5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated),
namely, ASS1, ALDH2, S100P, CLU, FGF13, FYN, FLRT2, AKT3, F2R, and
SNCA, was used to evaluate changes in gene expression levels of
cocultured tumor cells. Although HTG and LTG cell lines clustered in
different parts of a two-dimensional space, however, each of the five
controls was tightly grouped with its test sample counterpart exposed
to paracrine signaling from stromal fibroblasts (Fig. 1C, right).

Overexpression of a PEGA gene, S100P, stratifies intermediategrade tumors in vivo and in vitro. The top 10 overexpressed
PEGA genes were further tested in conjunction with two
independent clinical data sets for predicting patient outcome.
Using backward stepwise selection, among the grade predictors
retained for joint significance at P < 0.05, only S100P, a calcium
ion binding and calcium-dependent protein binding protein, attained significance in predicting RFS at the single gene level.
S100P expression tertiles defined for the combined data from two
independent data sets were used to separately evaluate RFS in
each data set. Significant associations were observed for both
data sets [data set 1: hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval
(95% CI), 1.2–1.74; P = 0.001; data set 2: hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI,
1.1–1.6; P = 0.002; Fig. 2A].
We then asked whether expression of S100P could serve to dichotomize ITG. In tumor tissue, S100P expression was significantly
associated with RFS at the cutpoint used above (data set 2: hazard
ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.2–3.4; P = 0.004; Fig. 2B). Similarly in vitro,
S100P expression in seven ITG-derived cell lines ranged from HTGlike (n = 2) to LTG-like (n = 5) transcript levels (Fig. 2C). In agreement with the expression profiling data, indirect immunofluorescence
of S100P protein in HTG cell lines displayed strong nuclear/cytoplasmic staining, whereas in LTG and some ITG cell lines, immunostaining was undetectable to minimal (Fig. 2D).

A role for S100P-correlated genes in the manifestation of
tumor grade. In the search for a broader scope of biological
processes, which link HTG and poor clinical outcome to S100P, we
identified genes whose expression levels were significantly correlated to S100P in clinical tumor tissue (S100P-CORtt). A criterion of
0.3 or greater correlation with S100P identified 17 probe IDs
(14 genes) common between two independent breast cancer data
sets (Supplementary Table S2). A higher correlation threshold
produced too few genes, whereas lower resulted in too many.
Known functions for the 14-gene set of S100P-CORtt genes included calcium ion binding, transport, and regulation (PLA2G10,
CAPN9, CALML5, GPRC5A, and ST6GALNAC2); glycosylation
(PMM2); cell adhesion (CEACAM6, MUC5B, CAPN9, and PLA2G10);
oxidoreductase activity (KMO); apoptosis (PYCARD and NTHL1);
cell differentiation and transforming growth factor h (TGFh) signaling (SLC2A10, CEACAM6, CAPN9, FXYD3, CAPN9, CALML5, and
CTSD); and cell motility and invasion (CTSD and CEACAM6).
In CCdl cell lines, expression of genes at significantly higher correlation (z0.9 or 0.9) to S100P, designated as S100P-CORcc, represented association with biological processes similar to those observed
for the 14-member S100P-CORtt gene set, for example, FGFR1, MYO1B,
GNA15, and SFN (calcium flux); JAG1, S100A2, and EHD2 (calcium ion
binding); BSPRY (ion transport); TMEM8, CD44, AZGP1, FLRT3, and
COL4A6 (cell adhesion); ALDH5A1 (oxidoreductase activity); SFN and

Toward a functional understanding of the role of the PEGA gene
S100P and genes correlated to it in tumor cells of varying histologic
grade, targeted transcript reduction was induced using S100P
siRNA. In these cells, a significant reduction in S100P protein levels
was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence of anti-S100P (data
not shown). Together with a reduction in S100P transcript levels,
siRNA-transfected HTG cell lines displayed a rapid reversal of several
S100P-CORcc and S100P-CORtt genes, providing a functional association for the correlative data (Fig. 3A). Dramatic cellular effects
induced by diminished levels of S100P-CORcc and S100P-CORtt transcripts included (a) an appreciable loss of the BrdUrd-incorporating
proliferating cell fraction (Fig. 3B); (b) marked growth reduction in
the three-dimensional substrate, Matrigel, resulting in significantly
smaller colony size, and rearrangement of cell nuclei from a random,
apolar configuration to a relatively organized central alignment
(Fig. 3C); and (c) a significant reduction in migration potential (Fig. 3D).
Targeting high-grade primary breast tumors through a
PEGA gene pathway. To test the effect of the functional attributes
of tumor aggressiveness conferred by S100P-COR genes at a clinical
level, we applied the 14-gene S100P-CORtt classifier toward outcome
stratification, independently of S100P. First, classic clinical parameters, such as patient age at diagnosis, clinical stage, histologic grade,
tumor size, lymph node status, and estrogen receptor (ER) status,
were tested for RFS prediction by combining two independent data
sets. These provided information for all six parameters in 440 tumors
with 139 recurrent cases. Among the classic variables, only tumor
size and ER status were found to be significantly related to outcome
in this diverse group of patients. For further analysis, we divided
these data into training (n = 292) and test (n = 148) sets using a
uniform random number generator.
In the next step, the 14-gene classifier was added to ER status
and tumor size for backward stepwise selection of significant
predictors of RFS in the training set. Tumor size and 3 of 14 genes
(FXYD3, GPRC5A, and PYCARD) maintained statistical significance
(P < 0.01; Supplementary Table S3). The size plus three-gene predictor was combined linearly, using coefficients from the Cox
proportional hazards model applied to the training set, to generate a
risk score for each patient. The 33rd and 67th percentiles of the risk
scores in the training set subdivided both training and test sets into
patient groups at high, medium, and low risk of recurrence. Survival in the three risk subgroups differed significantly in each data
set (P < 0.001 by log-rank test in each set; Fig. 4A, left). Moreover,
the log-rank test was significant in each ER category (P = 0.0274 for
ER-negative tumors and P < 0.001 for ER-positive tumors; Fig. 4A,
right). Table 2 summarizes the results and shows that RFS in the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

test set, using the same classification scheme as the training set,
gave closely similar results, thereby providing robust data validation.
CIs for 5- and 10-year survival in each subgroup of the training set
include the survival estimates of the test subgroup and vice versa
(Table 2). A log-rank test for survival differences within each subgroup
revealed no differences between survival in the training and test
group within each stratum (P = 0.98 for differences in the lowest risk,
P = 0.54 for differences in the middle risk, and P = 0.84 for differences
in the highest risk stratum). Our model was further validated using
the PSEP test, defined as the difference between the predicted
probability of survival in the best and worst groups at a selected time
(27). In our study, at 5 years, survival was 0.97 for the low-risk group
and 0.58 for the high-risk group, with a PSEP of 0.39 (0.97–0.58) in the
training set. In the test set, PSEP was 0.40 (0.92–0.52). Thus, PSEP for
training and test set survival was almost identical. Another validation
test consisted of comparing Harrell’s C statistic in the training and test
sets. The statistic is equal to the number of times a pair of patients,
selected at random, has their survival time correctly predicted by the
model. In our training data, the model correctly predicted the survival
order 70% of the time, whereas in the test set the correct order was
predicted 68% of the time. Both of these percentages are considered to
be quite high for breast cancer prediction (28).
Finally, toward the goal of defining candidate drugs, which
efectively address molecular heterogeneity in breast cancer for
targeting pertinent pathways, tumor cell response was compared
between a conventional chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, and
compounds whose mode of action is calcium dependent, such as
phenothiazine, chlorpromazine, and the calmodulin inhibitor W7.
Almost no apoptosis induction was observed in HTG primary
breast cancer cell lines or in the MCF7 cell line in response to 200
Amol/L cisplatin. However, these cell lines displayed striking
sensitivity to the calcium-binding drugs (Fig. 4B). Reversal of drug
response in S100P siRNA–transfected HTG cell lines showed a
direct role for S100P and coregulated genes in this regard (Fig. 4C).
In these experiments, the sensitivity of HTG cell lines to both
chlorpromazine and W7 was persistent over time (Fig. 4D). On
removal of drugs after a 24-h exposure period, HTG cells continued
to be eliminated through apoptotic cell death, whereas G1-arrested
LTG cells rapidly reentered the cell cycle.

Discussion
Here, our approach of evaluating global expression profiles of
tumor cell cultures of extreme histologic grades yet proliferating at
relatively comparable rates has significantly amplified the detectability of unsuspected grade-associated targets. Based on the widely
accepted fact that routine tissue culture conditions are inadequate
in representing the tumor microenvironment with regard to oxygen,

Autonomous Gene Expression Profile of Breast Cancer

and glucose concentrations, and a variety of paracrine interactions,
our experimental strategy uniquely afforded the level of resolution
required to uncover a functional basis for the diagnostic differential
in histologic differentiation patterns long used clinically for breast
cancer subclassification and patient management. Such a contextindependent profile of tumor aggressiveness as depicted by PEGA
could assist in sifting apart cellular programs of cancer cell autonomy from the broad interactive dimension of an infiltrating
malignant population amidst a wide spectrum of surrounding host
cells. Clinically, this could enable rapid improvements in disease
stratification and tumor targeting.
As shown, top-tier differentially expressed PEGA genes are a
robust discriminant of histologic grade in tumor-derived cell cultures as well as in clinical tumor tissue. Among these, CEACAM6,
MUC5B, and S100P are known indicators of patient outcome in
many tumor types, including breast cancer (29–31). However, little
is known about their functional role or mechanism of action during
tumor progression. In previous microarray analyses of archived
tumors with respect to grade or outcome, differential expression of
PEGA genes was masked and not found to be as distinctive as
proliferation-related genes. In fact, as shown in a recent metaanalysis (32), proliferation was the single common driving force for
nine independent prognostic signatures (7, 33–40). In contrast, PEGA
genes defined here are predictive without prior selection based on
patient outcome and reflect the basic infrastructure of cell
signaling pathways underlying the prognostic performance of
proliferation genes. Uniquely, in the derivation of this contextindependent signature, issues related to stromal and epithelial
heterogeneity within archived tumor tissue, observed to be a
limitation in the verification and clinical application of candidate
prognostic cancer markers in general, are easily circumvented.
In view of the significance of the calcium ion in the cell
differentiation process (41), the ‘‘backbone’’ of histologic grading
schemes, we have highlighted the role of the PEGA member S100P
and coregulated genes in the maintenance of the dedifferentiated,
HTG phenotype both in vivo and in vitro. S100 proteins display cell
type–specific expression patterns and regulate cytoplasmic Ca2+
levels (42). Consistent with this role, we have shown that transcript
levels of S100P and coregulated genes associated with HTG in
primary breast carcinoma parallel increased proliferation, decreased
apoptosis, and greater migration potential in high-grade, tumorderived cell cultures. Conversely, experimental silencing of S100P
initiates the appearance of epithelial polarity, a phenotype
characteristic of well-differentiated human breast epithelial cells (43).
Defining comprehensive phenotypes of histologic grade, which
portray molecular and functional traits, is a pivotal objective toward
unambiguous, quantitative measures of breast cancer stratification.
Based on gene expression cutpoint, a grade gene index classification
suggests that intermediate-grade tumors essentially represent high
or low histologic grade and reflect the outcome predicted for the two
extreme grades (8). Such an approach significantly enhances the
usefulness of pathologic evaluation of malignant tumors. Further
mechanistic insights about temporal events within the afflicted
tissue that lead to a specific tumor grade gene index at clinical
presentation could be invaluable. In this regard, induction of highgrade phenotypes in nonmalignant breast epithelial cells of high-risk
individuals exposed to natural and synthetic estrogens suggests that
specific grade-determining events occur early in tumorigenesis (22).
This is consistent with the observation of S100P overexpression at
early stages of breast cancer development (44).
It could be speculated that early in tumorigenesis, selective
expansion of cells harboring PEGA phenotypes, such as altered

www.aacrjournals.org

calcium regulation, cell adhesion, oxidative stress management,
apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell migration, facilitates the
manifestation of tumor dedifferentiation, recorded as microscopically determined histologic grade. Notably in our study, a threegene fingerprint composed of GPRC5A, PYCARD, and FXYD3
expression replaces ER status as a significant predictor of outcome
and enhances the predictive power of tumor size, another long
measured clinical parameter. Although it can be appreciated that
underlying these highly predictive genes are key cellular processes
related to calcium regulation, apoptosis, and differentiation,
respectively, a biological basis for the contribution of tumor size
to this algorithm, in particular, is presently unclear. In generating a
reliable risk score for breast cancer patients, this three-gene
fingerprint potentially serves as a molecular adjunct to two clinicopathologic variables: tumor size and histologic grade. High-grade
primary breast tumors are generally treated with radiation,
chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy (if ER positive). Response
to these agents is highly variable. Consequently, a sizeable proportion of patients with HTG succumb to their disease. Prior
knowledge of such cases could assist in more aggressive and
targeted clinical management. By using cell lines spanning a wide
spectrum of risk phenotypes identified by the PEGA profile, our
data further show exquisite sensitivity of high-risk tumor cells to
calcium-regulating drugs, whereas low-risk counterparts display
resistance by rapidly reversing to a proliferative state on drug
removal. These data provide robust functional evidence toward a
therapeutic approach worthy of further consideration.
Toward fruitful drug discovery efforts, our experimental strategy
advocates continued tumor cell characterization through the
implementation of new model systems. Although routinely used
cancer cell lines provide an unlimited supply of high-grade and
metastatic cells at late stages of cancer progression, an important
application of early stage and well-differentiated to moderately
differentiated tumor cell models is to provide functional validation
for presumed phenotypes of tumor aggressiveness. Using these
model systems, a biologically derived gene signature of tumor cell
immortalization, ImmSig, was previously identified, which portrays
the importance of oxidative stress–reducing genes in maintaining
continuously proliferating tumor populations (21), recently confirmed by others (45). In the search for new effective therapeutic
targets against aggressive breast tumor cells, it is important to
acknowledge that the successful application of autonomously
regulated gene products, such as ERBB2 and EGFR , represents the
validity of our described approach. Moreover, because expression
patterns of such genes are more accurately replicated in preclinical
experimental models, the potential for clinical reagent development is likely to be realized within a shorter time frame. The PEGA
signature sets forth a new paradigm and provides a clear rationale
for using the full range of grade-associated molecular phenotypes
and model systems for refining approaches in tumor targeting to
ensure data reliability and clinical benefit.
