prostate, non–small cell lung, ovarian, head and neck, urinary
tract, colon, and cervical (5–7). Activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway can occur due to upstream inputs, including deregulated
growth factor signaling (8), activating mutations in the protooncogene Ras (9), point mutations or overexpression of the PI3K-a
catalytic subunit (PIK3CA; refs. 7, 10), mutation or loss of PTEN
(11), and activating mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain
of Akt (12).
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway offers several targets for
therapeutic intervention and a number of agents are now in or
entering clinical trials (13). Much early work on the anticancer
potential of PI3K inhibitors was conducted with LY294002, a
chromene of low potency and selectivity, that inhibits multiple
kinases both related and unrelated to PI3K (14). The other
frequently used PI3K inhibitor is the fungal metabolite wortmannin
that shows a much higher specificity for the class 1 PI3Ks
compared with other related family members. However, wortmannin has proved to be too biologically unstable and toxic for use as
an antitumor agent (15). In our studies, we used PX-866, a
semisynthetic viridin that has been found to be a specific,
irreversible inhibitor of the class 1 PI3Ks with a mechanism
similar to wortmannin. Due to its chemically modified tetracyclic
core, PX-866 possesses a greatly increased metabolic stability,
decreased toxicity, and an increased specificity relative to other
PI3K family members (16) and has entered clinical trials as an
anticancer agent. PX-866 has been characterized against the class 1
isoforms and was found to selectively inhibit the a, y, and g
isoforms with IC50 values of 5, 9, and 2 nmol/L, respectively (17).
PX-866 is a selective inhibitor of PI3K and against a panel of
235 unrelated kinases, PX-866 at 1 Amol/L inhibited only 2 kinases
by <30%, Lck by 32%, and LOK by 40%. PX-866 has antitumor
efficacy in experimental cancer models as a single agent and in
combination with both conventional chemotherapy and targeted
agents (17, 18). As PX-866 and other specific inhibitors of PI3K/Akt
signaling move through clinical development, the identification
of positive and negative predictors of response to identify
individuals most likely to receive the maximum therapeutic benefit
is critical. Predictors for PI3K/Akt inhibitor sensitivity thus far
reported include PI3K pathway–specific mutations (7, 10–12),
increased insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 in glioma
(19), stathmin in breast cancer (20), and acidic ribosomal
phosphoprotein P2 (21).
In the present study, we tested PX-866 against a panel of
experimental human tumor xenografts derived from cell lines
of various tissue origins showing that mutant PIK3CA and loss
of PTEN activity were sufficient but not necessary predictors of
sensitivity to PX-866 in the presence of wild-type Ras, whereas
mutant oncogenic Ras predicted resistance, even in tumors with

Abstract
The novel phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor
PX-866 was tested against 13 experimental human tumor
xenografts derived from cell lines of various tissue origins.
Mutant PI3K (PIK3CA) and loss of PTEN activity were
sufficient, but not necessary, as predictors of sensitivity to
the antitumor activity of the PI3K inhibitor PX-866 in the
presence of wild-type Ras, whereas mutant oncogenic Ras was
a dominant determinant of resistance, even in tumors with
coexisting mutations in PIK3CA. The level of activation of
PI3K signaling measured by tumor phosphorylated Ser473-Akt
was insufficient to predict in vivo antitumor response to
PX-866. Reverse-phase protein array revealed that the Rasdependent downstream targets c-Myc and cyclin B were
elevated in cell lines resistant to PX-866 in vivo. Studies
using an H-Ras construct to constitutively and preferentially
activate the three best-defined downstream targets of Ras,
i.e., Raf, RalGDS, and PI3K, showed that mutant Ras
mediates resistance through its ability to use multiple
pathways for tumorigenesis. The identification of Ras and
downstream signaling pathways driving resistance to PI3K
inhibition might serve as an important guide for patient
selection as inhibitors enter clinical trials and for the
development of rational combinations with other molecularly
targeted agents. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):143–50]

Introduction
An important cell survival mechanism for many cancers is
mediated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein
kinase B) signaling pathway (1). Class I PI3Ks phosphorylate
membrane phosphatidylinositols to give PI(3,4,5)P3, which then
binds and recruits the serine/threonine kinase Akt through
its NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain in a process reversed
by PTEN phosphatase. The membrane-associated Akt is activated
by Thr308 phosphorylation by membrane-associated phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (2) and Ser473 phosphorylation, most likely
through the TORC2 complex (3). Activated Akt detaches from the
plasma membrane and moves to the cytoplasm and the nucleus
where it phosphorylates a battery of targets, leading to changes in
cellular functions (4). PI3K activity has been found to be aberrantly
activated in many human cancers, including breast, glioma,

respectively, and individual colonies were isolated. The plasmids were
generously provided by Dr. M. Wigler (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,
Cold Spring Harbor, NY). These Ras mutations have been previously
characterized in a number of models (22–26).
Antitumor studies. Approximately 107 cells in log cell growth were
injected s.c. in 0.1 mL sterile 0.9% NaCl into the flanks of severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Cell lines with H-Ras constructs were removed
from G418 one passage before injection. When the tumors reached 200 mm2,
the mice were stratified into groups of 8 to 10 animals having approximately
equal mean tumor volumes and p.o. administration of 2.5 to 3 mg/kg PX-866
begun every other day for 1 to 3 wk. For p.o. administration to mice, PX-866
(4S,4aR ,5R ,6aS,9aR,E)-1-[(diallylamino)methylene]-11-hydroxy-4-(methoxymethyl)-4a,6a-dimethyl-2,7,10-trioxo-1,2,4,4a,5,6,6a,7,8,9,9a,10-dodecahydroindeno(4,5-h)isochromen-5-yl acetate was dissolved at 0.3 to 0.5 mg/mL in 5%
ethanol in water and dosed by p.o. gavage. At the end of the study, antitumor
activity was expressed as a percentage of test/controls (T/C%) determined by
dividing the increase in volume of the PX-866–treated tumors by the increase
in volume of the control tumors from the start of treatment. Information on
mutations in the cell lines was obtained from the Sanger Institute database5

coexisting mutations in PIK3CA. Thus, mutant oncogenic Ras is a
primary determinant of resistance to the antitumor activity of
PX-866. Further studies used an H-Ras construct to constitutively
and preferentially activate the three best-defined downstream
targets of Ras: Raf, RalGDS, and PI3K. These constructs revealed
that activated Ras mediates resistance through its ability to use
these pathways concurrently. The identification of signaling
pathways driving resistance to PI3K inhibitors will aid patient
selection and reveals a need for the development of rational
combinations with other molecularly targeted agents.

Tumor PI3K activity. Mice were killed 24 h after the last PX-866
treatment; the tumors were then excised and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen. For the assay, the tumors were homogenized in lysis buffer
containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 0.2 mmol/L NaF,
0.2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 20 Ag/mL aprotinin, 20 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1% NP40, and 0.25%
sodium deoxycholate. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology) and 50 Ag of cell lysate protein were
boiled for 5 min with denaturing buffer containing 0.25 mol/L Tris (pH 6.8),
35% glycerol, 8% SDS, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, loaded on a 10%
acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel, and separated by electrophoresis at 150 V for
40 min. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane; preincubated with a blocking buffer of 137 mmol/L
NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 897 mmol/L CaCl2, 491 mmol/L MgCl2, 3.4 mmol/L
Na2HPO4, 593 mmol/L KH2PO4, and 5% bovine serum albumin; and
incubated overnight with anti–phosphorylated Ser473-Akt, anti-Akt,
anti–phosphorylated Ser338-Raf, anti-Raf, anti–cyclin B, anti–c-Myc poly-

clonal antibodies (Cell Signaling) or anti–h-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody
(GE Healthcare) was used for detection. Band density was measured using
the Renaissance chemiluminescence system on Kodak X-Omat Blue ML
films (Eastman Kodak).
Reverse-phase protein array. Cells were lysed with buffer containing
150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 100 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol,
1% Triton X-100 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets (Roche Applied Science), and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm
for 10 min at 4jC. Samples were denatured by the addition of 1 part
denaturing buffer to 3 parts cell lysate and boiling for 5 min. Sample
concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/mL with dilution buffer (1 part
denaturing buffer and 3 parts cell lysis buffer) and printed as serial dilutions
on glass slides, and specific proteins were quantified using 52 validated
antibodies as previously described (27, 28).
Apoptosis measurement. Cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L PX-866 for

centrifugation of the medium at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The pooled cell pellets
were resuspended and mixed with trypan blue dye. Dye incorporation into
nonviable cells was measured by counting 500 cells from randomly chosen
fields with a light microscope and a hemocytometer and expressed as a
percentage of the total number of cells counted. For confirmatory purposes,
the extent of apoptosis was evaluated by assessing Hoechst- and TUNELstained cytospin slides under fluorescent light microscopy and scoring the
number of cells exhibiting the classic morphologic features of apoptosis
and necrosis. For each condition, 10 randomly selected fields per slide
were evaluated, encompassing at least 1,500 cells. Alternatively, the Annexin
V/propidium iodide assay was carried out to determine cell viability
according to the instructions of the manufacturer (BD PharMingen) using a
Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer.
Colony formation. For studies of the effects of PX-866 on cell survival,
250 to 2,000 cells were plated in a 60-mm dish and 12 h later treated with
0.5 Amol/L PX-866 for 4 h. The medium was changed and the cells were

of more than 50 cells were counted using a ColCount colony counter
(Oxford Optronics). Individual assays were performed at multiple dilutions
with a total of six plates per data point.
Data analysis. Comparison of the effects of treatments and comparison
of protein levels in vitro used a two-tailed t test. Differences with a P < 0.05
value were considered statistically significant. A two-tailed t test and a
Pearson correlation was performed between normalized data obtained from
the reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis. For studies of the in vivo
antitumor activity of PX-866, a Whitney Mann U test was performed using
SPSS software (SPSS, Inc.).

Mutant Ras as a Marker for Resistance to PI3K Inhibition

The resistant lines A549 and H460 non–small cell lung cancers also
have a mutation resulting in a dysfunctional LKB1 concurrent with an
activating mutation in Ras. LKB1 is a known tumor suppressor that
down-regulates mTor-mediated protein translation in the presence of
low-energy conditions in the cell (29). How LKB1 contributes to the
sensitivity of the tumors to PI3K inhibition has not been determined;
however, in the two xenografts studied, the intermediate response to
PX-866 observed was similar to tumors with a PIK3CA mutation
together with oncogenic Ras. PX-866 was tested for its ability to
inhibit tumor PI3K activity measured by the phosphorylation of Akt
at Ser473 by Western blotting, which was found to be equally inhibited
in tumors that showed varying degrees of sensitivity to PX-866
treatment (Fig. 1B). Thus, RAS mutation seems to be an indicator of
resistance to PX-866, which is dominant over the sensitizing effects of
PI3K pathway mutations.
PX-866–resistant cells display characteristics of Rastransformed cells. We next used RPPA technology to address
whether response to PX-886 was dependent on the level of
expression or activation of proteins of the PI3K/Akt pathway
(Fig. 2A). Neither PI3K protein levels nor AKT activation measured
by Thr308 or Ser473 phosphorylation, nor the phosphorylation of

mice. These tumors were then classified into three groups: resistant
tumors that showed minimal or no response (No response, T/C
>70%), tumors that displayed a slowed but continued growth
through treatment (Low response, T/C 35–69%), and sensitive
tumors that displayed a antitumor response to PX-866 (Antitumor,
T/C <35%), which included two that showed a cytostatic response
and one that showed a regression. The mutation status of the cell
lines was obtained from the Sanger Institute database and
confirmed by mass spectral sequencing (Fig. 1A).
PC-3 prostate, BxPC3 pancreatic, HT-29 colon, Skov-3 ovarian,
and MDA-MB-361 breast cancers were all sensitive to PX-866. PC-3
prostate cancer is PTEN-null whereas HT-29 colon, Skov-3 ovarian,
and MDA-MB-361 breast cancers all have activating mutations in
PIK3CA. HT-29 colon cancer has a coexisting activating mutation
in B-Raf, but this was insufficient to cause resistance to PX-866
antitumor activity. Of the sensitive tumors, only BxPC3 has no
reported mutation in the PI3K/Akt pathway.
All tumors that have an activating mutation in Ras displayed
moderate to marked resistance to the antitumor activity of PX-866.
This includes HCT-116, HCT-15, and H460 colon cancer, which have
an activating PIK3CA mutation as well as an activating Ras mutation.

studied for their sensitivity to PX-866 as measured by colony
formation (Fig. 3C). K-Ras–null cells, H-Ras, Raf, and RalGDS
activated cell lines behaved similar to the wild-type HCT-116
(mutant K-Ras, mutant PIK3CA) line when treated with PX-866. In
contrast, an H-Ras mutant that preferentially activates PI3K
without activating RalGDS or Raf showed significant inhibition of
colony formation by PX-866.
Apoptosis was measured in the cell lines both by trypan blue
assay and flow cytometry. Cells with active Raf and RalGDS lines
showed levels of apoptosis similar to wild-type HCT-116 cells,
whereas H-Ras cells showed a moderate but significant increase in
apoptosis. In contrast, H-Ras cells with active PI3K, but not Raf or
RalGDS activation, showed a large and significant increase in
apoptosis (Fig. 4A).
Tumors lacking the mutant K-Ras allele have previously been
shown to be nontumorigenic (22), indicating that ras is a dominant
tumorigenic factor in this cell line. Tumors derived from implanted
ras-driven cell lines treated with vehicle or 2.5 mg/kg PX-866
were measured at the final day of treatment (Fig. 4B). The T/C
percentage for the wild-type HCT-116 cells was 49% for K-Ras–null
tumors, 54% for H-Ras tumors, and 53% (P = 0.05) for Raf-driven
tumors. RalGDS-driven tumors showed a significant decrease in
T/C to 37% (P = 0.01), and PI3K-driven tumors showed the greatest
sensitivity with a T/C value of 31% (P = 0.02).

Figure 5. Signaling in resistant and sensitive lines. Diagram showing the
interactions of the cell signaling studied in sensitive and resistant lines. Signaling
in PX-866–sensitive tumors comes from an increased reliance on the PI3K
pathway, arising from aberrant activation through growth factors (GF ) or mutated
components of the pathway itself (*). Tumors with an activated Ras protein
show a minimal response to inhibition of the PI3K pathway due to a shared
reliance on alternate signaling pathways including the Raf and RalGDS
pathways.

the downstream Akt target GSK-3, were significantly altered in
sensitive compared with resistant lines, or when correlated with
in vivo antitumor response (Fig. 2B). Two proteins on the array
showed a significant difference between sensitive and resistant
lines, with levels of c-Myc and cyclin B being significantly higher in
lines resistant to PX-866 in vivo (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that an
increase in both of these proteins has been reported as a result of
ras-induced transformation (30–32).
H-Ras or H-Ras mutants preferentially activating Raf or
RalGDS, but not RAS mutants linked to PI3K, are resistant to
PX-866 in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type HCT-116 K-Ras–positive
cells; HCT-116 K-Ras–null cells and K-Ras–null cells constitutively
expressing an active H-Ras; an H-Ras modified to preferentially
activate Raf (H-Ras V12S35), RalGDS (H-Ras V12G37), or PI3K
(H-Ras V12C40) were used as a model for the simultaneous and
individual activation of proteins effected by Ras signaling as
previously described (33). This model was used to determine
p-AKT and p-Raf activation (Fig. 3A). HCT-116 cells with activated
H-Ras, and PI3K-activating H-Ras, showed a robust activation of
PI3K signaling measured by phosphorylated Ser473-Akt. H-Ras
V12 and H-Ras V12C40 displayed similar levels of Akt activation.
H-Ras–activating RalGDS also retained the ability to activate Akt,
which has been recently reported (34). Wild-type HCT-116, H-Ras
V12, and H-Ras–activating Raf all showed similar levels of Raf
activation. H-Ras–activating Ral and H-Ras–activating PI3K
showed f40% decrease in Raf signaling. These cell lines were
then probed for cyclin B and c-Myc, which in our RPPA experiment
had been shown to be associated with resistance to PI3K inhibition.
Both wild-type HCT-116 and the K-Ras–null HCT-116 transfected
with activated H-Ras showed a robust expression of cyclin B, as did
the H-Ras–activating Raf, whereas the H-Ras linked to RalGDS
and PI3K showed lower levels of activation (Fig. 3B). Wild-type
HCT-116 and the K-Ras–null HCT-116 transfected with activated
H-Ras showed high levels of c-Myc protein, whereas the three
conditional Ras lines all showed lower levels. Despite slight
differences, all the selective H-Ras constructs retained the ability
to activate c-Myc or cyclin B to some extent. The lines were also

Discussion
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is critical for cancer cell growth
and survival (1) and a number of inhibitors of PI3K or Akt have
been, or will soon be, introduced into clinical trials as antitumor
agents (13). Determining which patients respond to these drugs
will play a role in how, and at what pace, they move through
clinical development (35). Our in vivo antitumor studies in a panel
of 13 molecularly characterized human tumor cell line–derived
xenografts found that tumors with mutant PIK3CA or PTEN-null,
but without mutant Ras, were sensitive to PX-866. The three most
sensitive lines, which displayed a cytostatic or regression response,
had activating mutations in PI3K. It is noteworthy that an
activating mutation in Raf in the HT-29–derived xenograft,
together with a PIK3CA-activating mutation, was insufficient to
reverse the cytostatic effects of PX-866. The BxPC3 pancreatic
cancer cell line with no reported mutations in the PI3K/Akt
pathway also showed a cytostatic response to PX-866. This cell
line has been characterized as having an inactivating mutation in
Smad 4, which has recently been shown to allow these cells to
down-regulate PTEN and thus activate PI3K signaling (36). This
illustrates that whereas individual mutations or deletions in the
PI3K/Akt/PTEN signaling pathway may be sufficient to predict
response to PX-866, they are not necessary for response as multiple
inputs could influence this pathway. Most importantly, we found
that mutant oncogenic Ras is a negative predictor of response to
the PI3K inhibitor PX-866 in xenografts, even those with concurrent
activating mutations in PI3K; thus, PI3K mutation cannot be used
as an individual marker for sensitivity.
RPPA technology was used to measure protein levels and
activation in the cell lines in vivo. Several proteins known to be
directly involved in PI3K/Akt signaling were studied, including
PIK3CA, Akt, and GSK. Neither total nor phosphoprotein levels
were significantly different between sensitive and resistant lines
nor was there a significant association with the in vivo antitumor
response. Thus, the expression level and activation of these PI3K/

Mutant Ras as a Marker for Resistance to PI3K Inhibition

lines. The H-Ras line specific for RalGDS signaling showed an
intermediate response, with a 17% increase in activity of PX-866
against the tumor. Together, these results show that the magnitude
of Akt activation does not determine the response to PI3K
inhibition but that activation of pathways downstream of
oncogenic Ras, parallel or compensatory for active PI3K, can
rescue tumors from inhibition.
Mutant active Ras has recently been described to predict
resistance to small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies against the
epidermal growth factor receptor (39, 40), presumably due to the
downstream location of Ras in epidermal growth factor receptor
signaling (41). Additionally, Ras-driven cell lines exhibit a modest
response to MEK inhibitors, showing a growth delay when grown
as xenografts, whereas B-Raf–driven xenografts display a cytostatic
response (42). This is similar to our observation with PX-866 in the
context of PI3K signaling and derive from the ability of Raf and
PI3K to converge on redundant downstream mediators, ‘‘funnel
factors’’ of translation, such as eiF4e (43), survival factors such as
Bad (44), and cyclin D for cell cycle progression (42). Ultimately,
treatment of Ras-driven tumors may lie in the direct inhibition of
the active Ras protein itself, or the combination of PI3K inhibitors,
including PX-866, with other agents targeting end points of the Ras
pathway.
The relationships of the signaling pathways we have studied are
shown in Fig. 5. Oncogenic Ras effectively negates the effects of
other potential predictors such as mutant PIK3CA, which has been
proposed to be a positive marker of response to inhibitors of PI3K/
Akt signaling and decreases the reliance of the tumor on PI3K
signaling, in favor of other Ras-dependent signaling pathways.
Thus, it may be necessary to know the mutational status of K-Ras,
PIK3CA, and PTEN as markers for predicting response to PI3K
inhibition. This information may have considerable significance in
tumor types, such as ovarian, endometrial, and colon tumors in
which mutations in PIK3CA or PTEN and Ras have been found to
coexist at relevant rates (45, 46).
In summary, we have studied the activity of the PI3K inhibitor
PX-866 in a panel of tumor cell line–derived xenografts and have
shown mutant oncogenic Ras to be a negative predictor of
response to PX-866, both independently and in the presence of
positive prognostic indictors such as PI3KCA and loss of PTEN
activity. Known effects of Ras-induced transformation such as
increased cyclin B and c-Myc were also negatively associated
with antitumor response to PX-866 The level of activation of
PI3K signaling measured with phosphorylated Akt was not
sufficient to predict in vivo antitumor response to PX-866. Ras
constructs modified to activate specific components of the Ras
signaling pathway showed that multiple pathways are used for
growth and survival both in vitro and in vivo in Ras-dependent
signaling.

Akt pathway proteins in vitro under basal conditions does not
translate into in vivo tumor sensitivity. Although this finding
excludes the level of Akt Thr308 or Ser473 phosphorylation as a
predictive biomarker, AKT phosphorylation remains a surrogate
end point for measuring the efficacy of target inhibition as
phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited by PX-866 in vivo ,
independent of the sensitivity or resistance of the tumor to
PX-866 in terms of its growth. Cyclin B and c-Myc were shown to be
significantly overexpressed in cell lines forming PX-866–resistant
xenografts compared with cell lines showing sensitivity to PX-866.
In previous studies, oncogenic Ras has been shown to have the
ability to up-regulate total c-Myc levels both through an increase in
mRNA levels (31) and increases in protein stability (32). Cyclin B
was increased in cells resistant to PX-866 treatment and showed a
significant negative association with antitumor response. Cyclin B
has been shown to be up-regulated during Ras-induced transformation and is associated with an increased mitotic rate. Whether
cyclin B and c-Myc act as factors contributing to the resistance of
mutant Ras tumors to PX-866, or only serve as markers of mutant
Ras, is not known. Additionally, the data derived from the H-Ras
lines possessing the ability to activate specific downstream
pathways showed that all three pathways studied are capable of
activating cyclin B and c-Myc. Therefore, it is possible that
the robust expression of these proteins in the mutant Ras lines in
the RPPA may come from a cooperative effect between the
pathways.
In colony formation assays, the HCT-116 H-Ras line with
specific activation of PI3K was found to be the only line sensitive
to the effects of PI3K inhibition, indicating that this line had been
made more dependent on PI3K signaling. Cells with the wild-type
H-Ras showed greater amounts of apoptosis than cells with
mutant K-Ras, which may reflect differences between the two Ras
isoforms in their utilization of downstream signaling (37), or the
ability of parental K-Ras to use less characterized pathways
downstream of Ras. This also suggests that the slowing of growth
seen in mutant Ras tumors in vivo following PX-866 treatment
may be a result of increased apoptosis. The highest apoptosis
was seen in the H-Ras cell line selectively activating PI3K, as it
lacked the resistance provided by parallel signaling pathways.
Of interest, HCT-116 K-Ras–null cells that retain a mutant PI3K
were not sensitized to PX-866, suggesting that in cell lines arising
from a Ras mutation, in contrast to tumors with exclusive
PI3K mutations, the input from Ras may be essential for PI3K
signaling to be used in tumorigenic processes. This observation
agrees with previous studies which found that despite this
PI3K heterozygous mutation, to sensitize HCT-116 to the effects
of PI3K inhibitors in colony formation and growth inhibition
assays, a homozygous PIK3CA variant needs to be created and
the assays performed in low serum conditions. Additionally,
HCT-116 cells retaining mutant K-Ras but with only a homozygous wild-type PI3K were able to form tumors (38). In contrast,
K-Ras–null HCT-116 cells have been shown to lack the ability
to form tumors (22).
When injected into mice, the oncogenic H-Ras and selective
H-Ras cells all retained the ability to form tumors. Despite both
having increased Akt activity compared with the parental HCT-116
line, the cells with an active H-Ras responded similarly to PX-866 as
the parental HCT-116, whereas PI3K-activated H-Ras cells showed a
23% greater response to PX-866 than control cells. H-Ras cells
displaying low levels of Akt activity than the other constructs
showed activity similar to the parental HCT-116 or HCT-116 H-Ras
