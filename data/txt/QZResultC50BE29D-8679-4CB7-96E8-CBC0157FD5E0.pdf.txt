Abstract
Chondrosarcomas are notorious for their resistance to
conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, indicating
there are no curative treatment possibilities for patients with
inoperable or metastatic disease. We therefore explored the
existence of molecular targets for systemic treatment of
chondrosarcoma using kinome profiling. Peptide array was
performed for four chondrosarcoma cell lines and nine
primary chondrosarcoma cultures with GIST882, MSCs, and
colorectal cancer cell lines as controls. Activity of kinases was
verified using immunoblot, and active Src- and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling were
further explored using imatinib and dasatinib on chondrosarcoma in vitro. The AKT1/GSK3B pathway was clearly active
in chondrosarcoma. In addition, the PDGFR pathway and the
Src kinase family were active. PDGFR and Src kinases can be
inhibited by imatinib and dasatinib, respectively. Although
imatinib did not show any effect on chondrosarcoma cell
cultures, dasatinib showed a decrease in cell viability at
nanomolar concentrations in seven of nine chondrosarcoma
cultures. However, inhibition of phosphorylated Src (Y419)
was found both in responsive and nonresponsive cells. In
conclusion, using kinome profiling, we found the Src pathway
to be active in chondrosarcoma. Moreover, we showed in vitro
that the inhibitor of the Src pathway, dasatinib, may provide a
potential therapeutic benefit for chondrosarcoma patients
who are not eligible for surgery. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6216–22]

Introduction
Curative treatment of chondrosarcoma of bone is restricted to
surgery because this tumor is reported to be extremely resistant
against conventional therapeutic modalities (1–3). Therefore, there
is not much to offer with curative intent to patients with
metastatic disease or with tumors at inoperable sites. Whereas
low-grade chondrosarcomas (grade I) are treated by marginal or
intralesional excision, followed by margin improvement by
application of fenol or cryosurgery (3, 4), high-grade chondrosarcoma is treated by, often mutilating, large en-bloc resection or
amputation. The metastatic rate of chondrosarcoma is directly
related to histologic grade (5), currently being the only predictor of
outcome, although histological grade is highly subjected to

interobserver variability (6, 7). Grade I chondrosarcomas almost
never metastasize, whereas metastases occur in 10% of grade II
chondrosarcomas and in 71% of grade III chondrosarcomas (8).
The 10-year survival for patients with high-grade chondrosarcoma
is poor: 64% for grade II and only 29% for grade III tumors.
Few recurrent genetic alterations were found in chondrosarcoma, pointing toward a loss of cell cycle control of chondrosarcoma, such as gain of CDK4 (9, 10) and loss of p16 (11, 12).
Decreased cell viability was shown after restoration of p16
expression or the knockdown of CDK4 by shRNA in chondrosarcoma cells in vitro (10). Thus far, there is little evidence for a role
for kinase inhibitors in chondrosarcoma treatment. In addition to
CDK4 (10), AKT (13) and Flk-1/KDR, PDGFRB (14), and FGFR1 (15)
were shown to be activated and suggested as possible targets in the
treatment of chondrosarcoma.
In the present study, we explored new treatment options for
chondrosarcoma using kinome profiling. Kinases are enzymes that
phosphorylate tyrosine/serine or threonine residues on other
proteins. They play a major role in signaling cascades that
determine cell cycle entry, cell survival, and differentiation fate,
which are often deregulated in tumors. Kinases are excellent
targets for anticancer therapy because they work as a molecular
switch; their regulation is reversible, rapid (merely in seconds), and
does not require new protein synthesis (reviewed in ref. 16).
Kinome profiling allows the detection of kinase activity in cell
lysates by detecting the level of substrate phosphorylation. This
produces a comprehensive description of cellular signal transduction in a particular sample, which can be assigned to specific
pathways, as has been shown by Diks and colleagues (17). Kinome
profiling identified the AKT1/GSK3B pathway, PDGFRB and the Src
pathway, as potential targets for chondrosarcoma treatment. We
showed that inhibition of the Src pathway by dasatinib indeed
resulted in decreased cell viability in seven of nine chondrosarcoma
cell cultures in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Imatinib mesylate (Glivec/Gleevec, STI571) was obtained from
Novartis and dasatinib (Sprycel, BMS-354825) from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Both drugs were dissolved in DMSO.
Cell culture. Chondrosarcoma cell lines, chondrosarcoma primary
cultures (Table 1), and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell line, GIST882
(18), were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Invitrogen LifeTechnologies), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(Life Technologies). GIST882, a gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell line
carrying a homozygous exon 13 missense mutation (K642E) in KIT (18) and
known to be imatinib sensitive, was used, treated and untreated, as a proof
of principle of the Pepchip technique. Two cell cultures of normal bone
marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC; L2361 and L2370) were
used as nonneoplastic counterpart control. In addition, an independent set

of five colorectal carcinoma cell lines were tested (HT29, RKO, LS180,
SW480, SW837) to estimate specificity.
Cells were grown at 37jC in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5%
CO2. The cartilaginous phenotype of the chondrosarcoma cultures was
confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR, showing mRNA expression of
collagens I, 2B, 3, and 10, Aggrecan and SOX9 (19).
Kinome array analysis. A kinase substrate peptide array was used
containing 1,024 different kinase substrates spotted in triplicate with
16 negative and 16 positive controls (Pepchip Kinomics, Pepscan Presto).
Cells were harvested during their exponential growth phase. Cells were
washed thrice with cold PBS. Cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology)
supplemented with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was
used. Lysates were processed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen) for 10 min
and a filter (Millipore) for 5 min both at 4jC to retain optimal kinase
activity. For concentration of the lysates and discarding of the lysis buffer, a
10 kDa spin column (Millipore) was used for 30 min at 4jC. Concentration
of the protein lysate was measured using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).
For kinase array analysis, 50 Ag of the protein were diluted in kinase buffer
(Cell Signaling Technology) in the presence of complete mini EDTA free
(Roche) and 1 mmol/L PMSF. To 62.5 AL of the lysate, 12.5 AL activation mix
[20 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, Glycerol 5%, Brij-35 0.01%,
0.05 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 5 Amol/L ATP, and 20 ACi [g-33P]ATP]
was added. A 24  60-mm coverslip was used. The slides were incubated in
a humid chamber for 2 h at 37jC. Subsequently, slides were rinsed in PBS/
Triton X-100 1% twice, then washed twice in NaCl 2.0M/Triton X-100 1% for
15 min, followed by washing in distilled water. All buffers were used at 37jC
and washing was performed in a rotation stove at 37jC. Subsequently, the
slides were dried in a 50 mL tube in a centrifuge at 2,000 rpm. The
measurement of the 33P signal was performed using a Biomolex reader for
real-time digital imaging of radioisotopes (Biomolex). At least 1  106 hits
were collected.
Data analysis. Biomolex Readback V3.6 and Biosplit software (Biomolex)
were used to create a list with intensities using a grid. For further data
mining, R-packages Affyio and Limma were used.3 Quality of the triplicates
and distribution of the data were assessed, and quantile normalization
(Affyio) was performed. Phosphorylated substrates in chondrosarcoma
cultures were compared with those in MSCs using Limma, which provides
functions to summarize results using a linear model to perform hypothesis
tests and adjust the P values for multiple testing (20). In addition, the data
set of 13 chondrosarcoma cell cultures was compared with an independent
3

set of five colorectal carcinoma cell lines using Limma. Subsequently,
phosphorylation signals of all chondrosarcoma cultures were averaged and
the top 100 (the common denominators) were imported for core analysis in
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).4 IPA is a literature-based program that
calculates the probability of involvement of identifiers and, in this case,
combinations of kinases, in 74 known canonical pathways.
Immunoblotting. Ten micrograms of each sample, stored in kinase
buffer at 80jC, were run on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore) using
electrophoresis. Membranes were preincubated with 5% skinned milk in
PBS-Tween 0.05%. After incubation with first and secondary antibodies, the
membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence Western
blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by
exposure to X-ray films (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences).
Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against phospho-c-Raf (Ser338; 56A6),
phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221; 41G9), phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204; D13.14.4E), phospho-p90RSK
(Ser380; 9D9), phosphorylated AKT (Ser473; D9E), phosphorylated AKT
(Thr308; C31E5), pan AKT (C67E7), GSK3B (27C10) and rabbit antibodies
against phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser259), and phosphorylated GSK3B (Ser9)
were obtained from Cell signaling Technology. Jurkat cells, treated with
LY294002 or Calyculin A, were used as a negative and positive control for
AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated
Src (Y419) was obtained from R&D Systems. Monoclonal antibody to total
Src (clone GD11) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Pro-caspase-3
(37 kDa) and h-tubulin antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology and
Sigma Aldrich, respectively.
In vitro proliferation assays. Response of chondrosarcoma primary
cultures to escalating doses of imatinib (range, 1.0–100 Amol/L) was
measured by cell count using a Bürker chamber. GIST882 was used as
positive control. Response of chondrosarcoma cell lines and primary
cultures to escalating doses dasatinib (range, 5.0 nmol/L–1.0 Amol/L) was
measured either by tritium incorporation assay (OUMS27, CH2879, SW1353,
L784, L869) or WST-1 colorimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH; L1081,
L1250, L2252, L2388), which measures mitochondrial activity as described
previously (21). C3842, L821, and L835 did not reach an adequate
proliferation rate to allow inhibition experiment. Results were compared
with a poor responding (ALL CR) and a well-responding acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL CM) cell line, as well as to GIST882, known to
respond to dasatinib at f10 nmol/L (22). In brief, 20,000 cells were seeded

in a 96-well plate and were allowed to incubate with the drugs for 72 h. 3H
was added, and the following day, cells were harvested using the FilterMate
system (Perkin-Elmer). 3H-thymidine incorporation was measured using a
TopCount scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer). All experiments were
performed in duplicate and in the presence of a maximum of 0.1% DMSO.
In vitro experiments were performed at least thrice. Graphs show data from

Results
Identification of active kinases in chondrosarcoma cultures.
Through kinome profiling of 13 chondrosarcoma cultures, we
created a list of phosphorylated targets and their corresponding
active kinases. The top 100 of chondrosarcoma targets was
analyzed using IPA, ranking the importance of the corresponding
kinases in chondrosarcomas. The specificity of this list of
substrates for chondrosarcoma was verified by comparing the
intensity of the signals with those for normal MSCs, using Limma
(Supplementary Table S1). Based on the average spot intensity and
how frequent their targets were present in the top 100 of
substrates, 21 kinases were identified by IPA analysis (Table 2).
The AKT pathway (AKT1 and GSK3B) was found to be the most
active pathway in chondrosarcoma, followed by Titin and RPS6
kinase. Also, the Src pathway (FYN and LCK) and the Ras/Raf/
MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway stimulated by
PDGFRB were active in chondrosarcoma. In addition, Aurorakinase
B and CDC2 were found.

Verification of kinome profiling. Kinome profiling of untreated GIST882 revealed an active Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which
is activated by KIT (Supplementary Table S2). GIST882 carries an
activating KIT mutation (18). Subtracting the average intensities of
untreated GIST882 from the 1.0 Amol/L imatinib-treated GIST882
revealed that indeed the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was targeted
by imatinib, which was confirmed by analysis using IPA (data not
shown). Inhibition of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in GIST882
by imatinib was verified by immunoblot, using the same lysates as
hybridized on the kinase array. Staining for cRaf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2,
and 90RSK was decreased after 1.0 Amol/L imatinib treatment
(Fig. 1A), confirming that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was
targeted by imatinib.
In addition, comparison of the substrate phosphorylation
patterns of all substrates of 13 chondrosarcoma cell cultures and
the two MSC cultures (Supplementary Table S2), and the five
colorectal carcinoma cell lines (Supplementary Table S3) was
performed, revealing 167 and 175 differently phosphorylated spots,
respectively (adjusted P < 0.01).
Phosphorylation of AKT in chondrosarcoma cell cultures could be
verified by immunoblot at both the serine 473 and the threonine 308
position in all cultures (Fig. 2). Whereas total GSK3B was present in
nearly all samples, phosphorylation levels of GSK3B at serine 9 were
indeed very low in the chondrosarcoma cell cultures confirming
active GSK3B. cRaf, which links the AKT pathway with the MEK/ERK
pathway, was also detected by immunoblot in all primary cultures.

Kinome Profiling of Chondrosarcoma

Figure 1. Chondrosarcoma cultures are susceptible to dasatinib but not to imatinib. A, treatment of GIST882 with 1.0 Amol/L imatinib leads to a decrease in levels of
cRaf, phosphorylated MEK 1/2, ERK 1/2, and p90RSK verifying interference with the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by imatinib. B, imatinib treatment decreases cell
numbers in the imatinib responsive GIST882 cell line. However, four chondrosarcoma cultures did not respond to imatinib treatment, unless toxic concentrations
of 30 and 100 Amol/L were used. C, dasatinib causes decreased cell viability in 5 of 6 chondrosarcoma primary cell cultures. A decrease in cell viability of 20% at
15 nmol/L and 40% to 50% at 1,000 nmol/L was observed in L1081, L1250, L2252, and L2388. Primary culture L869 responded with a 50% decrease in cell
growth at 15 nmol/L treatment. D, cell lines OUMS27 and SW1353 showed a decrease in viability at 50 nmol/L dasatinib, whereas both primary culture L783 and cell line
CH2879 showed a response only at low concentrations (5 and 15 nmol/L), whereas at higher concentrations, no effect was found. E, in positive controls, ALL
CM and GIST882, a decrease in cell viability of >80% was observed, whereas a limited effect was found in dasatinib resistant leukemia cell line CR.

Chondrosarcomas do not respond to imatinib treatment
in vitro. In Table 2, the currently used kinase inhibitors specific for
the active kinases in chondrosarcoma are shown. Dasatinib and
imatinib, targeting the Src kinase family and KIT/PDGFR pathway,
respectively, were available to us. Sensitivity of chondrosarcoma
cells to both drugs was tested. Whereas GIST882 showed a
profound decrease of cell number relative to the DMSO control at
lower dosages of imatinib, the chondrosarcoma primary cultures
did not show any effect, only at high concentrations of imatinib,
probably due to nonspecific toxicity, rather than on target effects
(Fig. 1B).

Chondrosarcomas are responsive to dasatinib treatment
in vitro. Seven of nine chondrosarcoma cell cultures responded to
dasatinib treatment with a decrease in cell growth. Primary
cultures L1081, L1250, L2252, and L2388 showed 20% decreased
cell viability at 15 nmol/L and 40% to 50% decreased viability at
1,000 nmol/L of dasatinib treatment, as measured by either 3H
incorporation or WST-1 assay (Fig. 1C). The strongest effect was
observed in primary culture L869, with a 50% reduction in cell
viability compared with the DMSO control at 15 nmol/L dasatinib
(Fig. 1C). Inhibition of cell growth of the chondrosarcoma cell lines
SW1353 and OUMS27 occurred at 50 nmol/L (Fig. 1D). In contrast,

both primary culture L784 (Fig. 1C) and cell line CH2879 (Fig. 1D)
did not show any effect. Positive controls ALL CM and GIST882,
and negative control ALL CR are shown in Fig. 1E.
Dasatinib treatment of chondrosarcoma decreased Srcphosphorylation but does not result in caspase-3–mediated
apoptosis. To investigate the effect of dasatinib on Src signaling,
GIST882, a good responsive chondrosarcoma cell culture (L869)
and a nonresponsive chondrosarcoma cell line (CH2879) were
treated with increasing doses of dasatinib for 6 hours. Whereas
levels of total Src do not decrease upon dasatinib treatment, a
decrease in phosphorylated Src (pSrc; Y419) was found in GIST882
(Fig. 3A). At a dosis of 6.25 nmol/L dasatinib, the pSrc staining has
disappeared. Also in L869, the responsive cell culture, levels of
phosphorylated Src decrease gradually, although both bands of the
staining are present (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, in CH2879, the level of
phosphorylation of Src decreased upon dasatinib treatment as well
(Fig. 3C), whereas no effect on cell viability was found. Staining for
pro-caspase 3 (37 kDa) showed a gradual decrease in GIST882
upon dasatinib treatment starting at 12.5 nmol/L, suggesting
pro-caspase-3 cleaving and active caspase-3 mediated apoptosis
(Fig. 3A; ref. 23). Caspase-3 staining seems to increase slightly at
50 nmol/L and then decreases further until 200 nmol/L, although
tubulin was slightly variable. Proapoptotic action of dasatinib has
been described previously (22). However, caspase-3 mediated
apoptosis could not be shown in both chondrosarcoma cell
cultures (Fig. 3B and C).

Discussion
Chondrosarcomas are highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and as a consequence, there is no
curative treatment option for patients with inoperable or
metastatic disease. Kinome profiling was used to search for
drugable kinases in chondrosarcoma.
A major caveat in large scale phosphorylation studies is the
promiscuity of kinases in the absence of in vivo regulation signals,
which may lead to false-positive results. Ideally, by comparing
kinase profiles with and without a certain stimulus, for instance, a

kinase inhibitor, kinases being activated or deactivated upon the
stimulus can be detected, as was previously reported (17). However,
because there are no compounds available that are known to have
any effect in chondrosarcoma, we averaged 13 chondrosarcoma
cultures to get an impression of the most active kinases and the
pathways they are involved in.
Using GIST882, we showed that the Pepchip kinome profiling
platform correctly identified the pathways that are known to play
an important role in GIST and that their activity is decreased by
imatinib treatment. Using MSCs and an independent set of
colorectal carcinoma cell lines, we also showed tumor specificity
and tumor type specificity, respectively.
Analyzing kinome profiles of 13 chondrosarcoma cell cultures
identified several drugable targets. Validation of the results by
immunoblot as well as the inhibition of chondrosarcoma cell
viability in vitro by dasatinib show that this is an elegant approach
to identify targets for treatment of tumors for which thus far no
systemic treatment options are available.
Analyzing the top 100 activated substrates of the 13 chondrosarcoma cell cultures revealed 21 active kinases, of which AKT and
GSK3B were shown to be the most active. The phosphorylation of
AKT was confirmed by immunoblot. This pathway can be blocked
by Enzastaurin, a PKCB-selective inhibitor, which has been shown
to suppress angiogenesis and induces apoptosis in colorectal
cancer and glioblastoma xenografts, by targeting AKT and GSK3B
(24). In contrast to AKT, GSK3 is constitutively active and becomes
functionally inactivated after phosphorylation. GSK3 has a central
function in physiologic (i.e., transcription, apoptosis, and cell cycle
progression) and pathologic (i.e., diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer, and
carcinogenesis) processes (reviewed in ref. 25). In chondrosarcoma
cell cultures, we showed the absence of phosphorylation at serine 9,
indicative for active GSK3B. An important role for the AKT kinase
in chondrosarcoma survival was previously suggested by Jang and
colleagues (13).
Kinome profiling of chondrosarcoma also revealed an active Src
pathway. Src plays a role in the regulation of embryonic

showed phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 and
threonine 308, although levels of pan AKT were variable.
Although pan GSK3B was detected in nearly all samples,
phosphorylation at serine 9 was absent confirming active
GSK3B. Phosphorylated Raf was detected in nearly all
samples. Jurkat treated with LY294002 ( ) or Calyculin A
(+) served as a negative and positive control of AKT
phosphorylation, respectively.

Kinome Profiling of Chondrosarcoma

Figure 3. Decrease in cell viability by dasatinib seems to be unrelated to
inhibition of phosphorylated Src and to caspase 3–mediated apoptosis in
chondrosarcoma. A, although levels of total Src do not decrease upon dasatinib
treatment in GIST882, a decrease in phosphorylated Src (pSrc ; Y419)
is shown upon dasatinib treatment. At a dosis of 6.25 nmol/L dasatinib, the upper
band of the pSrc staining has disappeared. Staining for pro-caspase
3 shows a gradual decrease in GIST882 upon dasatinib treatment. B, in L869,
the dasatinib sensitive cell culture, levels of pSrc decrease gradually, although
both bands of the staining are present. A decrease of pro-caspase 3 could
not be shown in L869. C, also in CH2879, the nonresponsive cell culture, the
level of phosphorylation of Src decreases upon dasatinib treatment. Again, no
decrease in pro-caspase-3 could be observed.

identified activity of Fyn and Lck in chondrosarcoma, which are,
together with Yes, Fgr, Hck, Blk, Lyn, and Frk, members of the Src
family. The Src pathway can be targeted by dasatinib. Dasatinib is
well-known for its efficacy in the treatment of chronic
myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive
ALL (28), in which dasatinib inhibits the Abl-kinases (29).
Recently, dasatinib has also been shown to be effective in the
treatment of cells derived from solid tumors, i.e., prostate cancer
(30) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (31). In
previous research, also expression of Abl kinase was shown in
chondrosarcoma by immunohistochemistry with interestingly, a
negative correlation with histologic grade (32). We show
decreased cell viability after dasatinib treatment in the majority
(7 of 9) of chondrosarcoma cell cultures, although a maximum of
60% of inhibition of cell growth was reached, whereas the effect
in GIST882 and the leukemia cell lines were more profound.
This difference may be explained by secondary events, which
stimulate cell growth in chondrosarcoma, i.e., the loss of cell
cycle inhibition, which was previously shown to occur in 96% of
the tumors (10). Likewise, GISTs have been shown to become
refractory to initial successful response to imatinib due to loss of
cell cycle control (33).
Strikingly, dose-dependent inhibition of Src kinase phosphorylation by dasatinib, as measured by autophosphorylation at Y419,

www.aacrjournals.org

was found both in a responsive (L869) and in a nonresponsive
(CH2879) cell culture. This suggests that growth inhibition induced
by dasatinib might be independent of Src kinase phosphorylation.
Thus, dasatinib might exert its function via other pathways in
chondrosarcoma, i.e., by inhibition of Abl kinases, fibroblast growth
factor receptor kinases or PDGFR kinases (34) or AKT (35). Activity
of the latter two is shown in the present study.
Although dasatinib was suggested to induce caspase-3–mediated
apoptosis in the control GIST882 cell line, this was not observed in
chondrosarcoma cell cultures. This suggests that dasatinib inhibits
chondrosarcoma cell growth through other mechanisms, for
example, by inducing G1 arrest. However, immunoblotting for pSrc
and caspase-3 was performed on one responsive and one
nonresponsive cell line only and extrapolating these results to all
chondrosarcomas should be done with caution.
More experiments are needed to further explore the mechanism
underlying growth inhibition and whether the effects of dasatinib
on chondrosarcoma growth can be increased by combination with
another cytostatic compound to reach higher growth inhibition
rates.
Despite the finding of PDGFRB activity using the Pepchip and
the fact that PDGFRA protein expression (36) and activity of the a
and h receptor were reported previously in the absence of gain-offunction mutations (14), we were not able to decrease cell viability
of chondrosarcoma cell cultures by imatinib treatment. In contrast,
Klenke and colleagues (15) showed SU6668, which inhibits tyrosine
kinases PDGFRB, Flk-1/KDR, and FGFR1, to repress chondrosarcoma growth via antiangiogenesis in vivo. One must take into
account that we studied the effect of dasatinib and imatinib in
chondrosarcoma in vitro, and that an additional effect in vivo
through the inhibition of angiogenesis may be possible, as has been
described for dasatinib (37).
Also Flavopiridol and AZD-1152, inhibitors of CDC2 and Aurora
kinase activity, respectively, were suggested for chondrosarcoma
treatment, by our Pepchip approach (Table 2). Flavopiridol is a pan
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, not only targeting CDC2, also
known as cyclin-dependent kinase 1, but also cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 and 4. Previously, we reported the amplification of 12q13
(9), the locus of CDK4, increased expression of CDK4 and a
decrease in cell viability using shRNA to knock down CDK4
expression in vitro (10). We suggested the use of CDK4 inhibitors in
the treatment of chondrosarcoma, which is now being emphasized
accordingly in the present study. Also RPS6kinase was found to be
active in chondrosarcoma, which was found to predict the
response to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors in sarcoma
(38). RPS6 kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of
ribosomal protein S6, which we previously found to be deleted
and down-regulated in a subset of chondrosarcomas (9). This
suggests that the tumor cells may try to overcome this deletion by
phosphorylation. No array CGH data were available for the cell
cultures described here.
In the present study, we report the kinome profiling of 13
chondrosarcoma cell cultures, and by averaging the profiles, we
identified activity of the Src pathway. Accordingly, Src inhibitor
dasatinib decreased cell viability in seven of nine chondrosarcoma cell cultures. Our experiments suggest that dasatinib is a
potential treatment option in chondrosarcoma treatment. Future
studies in vivo should be performed to confirm these data and
to investigate the combination with conventional chemotherapy
and possible additional effects through the inhibition of
angiogenesis.
