BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may have efficacy as an intervention for advanced
malignancies. Oral ulceration (OU), reported as mucositis, has been a dose-limiting toxicity for this new class of
agents. An analysis of the appearance, course, and toxicity associations of mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis
(mIAS) demonstrated that the condition is distinct from conventional mucositis (CM) and more closely resembles
aphthous stomatitis. METHODS: Safety data from 78 solid tumor patients enrolled in 2 Phase 1, multicenter trials of
the mTOR inhibitor deforolimus (AP23573, MK-8669) were evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 3.0) criteria were coded, consolidated, and stratified according to the presence or absence and duration of
concordant OU. The relation between OU and other AEs was analyzed. RESULTS: Treatment-emergent AEs were
reported in 91% of 78 study participants. OUs were reported in 66%, appeared within 5 days of deforolimus administration, and were discrete, ovoid, superficial, well demarcated, and surrounded by an erythematous halo. Their clinical
appearance and distribution were similar to that of aphthous stomatitis but inconsistent with CM. Patients with OU
were more likely to have nonspecific rashes and acneiform dermatitis but not gastrointestinal AEs. CONCLUSIONS:
OU associated with mTOR inhibitor therapy differed from CM. Lesions more closely resembled those of aphthous stomatitis. The lack of other gastrointestinal involvement but the presence of a higher incidence of concomitant cutaneous AEs provided additional evidence to suggest a distinction between mIAS and CM. Treatment strategies for
aphthous stomatitis may be a rational approach for the prevention and control of mIAS. Cancer 2010;116:210–5.

KEYWORDS: mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, mucositis, aphthous stomatitis, cancer.

Because of its role as a central regulator of key pathways believed to be important in the proliferation of cancers, the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a viable target for the generation of a new group of antitumor
agents. mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging efficacy results in patients with a range of advanced malignancies.1 One of these agents, temsirolimus, is approved for the management of renal cell carcinoma.2 Although generally
well tolerated, the most common dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for mTOR inhibitors has been mouth ulcers.3,4 Because
mouth ulcers in cancer trials are defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE) (version 3.0) as mucositis, it largely was assumed that mTOR-associated oral lesions were equivalent to classic chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in their clinical presentation, etiopathology, risk, course, and susceptibility for intervention.

mTOR Inhibitor-Associated Stomatitis/Sonis et al

The clinical course of oral mucositis associated with
conventional, cycled cancer chemotherapy regimens has
been well described.5 Depending on the anticancer drugs
used, approximately 10% to 30% of patients who are
receiving treatment for solid tumors reportedly develop
ulcerative mucositis (NCI-CTCAE grade 2 or worse) during the first cycle of chemotherapy. Among patients for
whom there is no dose de-escalation, the incidence of
mucositis increases significantly in subsequent treatment
cycles. The incidence is as high as 70% in patients who
undergo myeloablative conditioning before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.6 Mucositis typically begins
within 4 to 5 days after chemotherapy, peaks between
Day 7 and Day 10, and spontaneously resolves soon
thereafter.5 Lesions appear on the movable mucosa and
are characterized by their nonuniform shape, depth, the
presence of a fibrinous pseudomembrane with cellular
debris, and lack of peripheral erythema. The ulcers can
produce pain of such intensity as to require changes in
diet and systemic analgesic intervention. Other than palliation, to the best of our knowledge, there currently is
no approved intervention for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients
with solid tumors.
The solid organ transplantation literature often cites
‘‘aphthous-like’’ oral lesions associated with sirolimus
(Rapamycin) therapy, an mTOR inhibitor used for its
immunomodulatory properties.7 Unlike typical chemotherapy-induced mucositis, aphthous lesions present as discrete,
ovoid, relatively shallow ulcers surrounded by a characteristic erythematous margin.8,9 It is interesting to note that their
pathogenesis has been studied reasonably well, although it is
not entirely understood and differs considerably from that
of mucositis.8,10 From a clinical standpoint, a range of effective medical treatments, including topical and systemic steroids, topical leukotriene inhibitors, and inhibitors of
tumor necrosis factor, are available.8,11
The objectives of the current study were to define
more accurately and to characterize the nature of mTOR
inhibitor-associated oral toxicities. We evaluated the clinical features and course of oral lesions and their association
with other toxicities among cancer patients who were
receiving mTOR inhibitor therapy, and we compared
those findings with the expected results among individuals
who received conventional chemotherapy. Our findings
suggest that mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis
(mIAS) is distinct from conventional chemotherapyinduced mucositis. It is worth noting that this finding
indicates that there may be effective approaches to manag-

ing this dose-limiting toxicity, thus allowing maximum
benefit from this emerging class of anticancer agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Interim safety data were obtained from 2 open-label,
phase 1, multicenter trials12,13 of deforolimus (AP23573)
for patients with solid malignancies (Table 1) who had
experienced treatment failure with prior standard therapy
or for whom adequate therapy was not available (National
Clinical Trials (NCT) identifiers: NCT00060632 for
Trial AP23573-02-101 and NCT00060645 for Trial
AP23573-02-102). Patients with primary central nervous
system malignancy or any form of leukemia were
excluded. Patients were excluded from the study if they
had received any prior therapy within 4 weeks of deforolimus dosing (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosureas)
with the exception of any agents with a known half-life
24 hours (3 weeks). Stable dose maintenance steroids
for central nervous system metastases and low-dose maintenance steroid therapy for other conditions were allowed.
The objectives of these dose-escalation trials were to
establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated
dose of deforolimus administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once weekly (Trial AP23573-02-101)12 or
once daily for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks (Trial
AP23573-02-102).13 The 28-day cycle was repeated for
patients who tolerated treatment and exhibited tumor
response or stable disease. An accelerated titration design
and flat-fixed dosing were used. A starting dose of 3 mg
was chosen on the basis of preclinical toxicology data. In

Mouth-related AEs

the absence of a grade 2 or worse treatment-related
adverse event (AE), the dose was doubled (100%) in the
subsequent cohort. If a grade 2 or worse treatment-related
AE was observed, then the dose was increased by 50%. If a
DLT occurred in Cycle 1, then subsequent doses were
increased by 25%. AEs were scored and graded using
NCI-CTCAE (version 3) criteria.
A list of toxicities was created, and AEs were coded
and consolidated from study data. All verbatim AEs were
reported by the investigators in the case report forms and
were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) (version 5.0).14 All primary safety
analyses were performed using the MedDRA preferred
terms and system organ classes. In addition, several terms
were pooled to facilitate the presentation of some AEs.
For example, the designation ‘‘mouth sore’’ was used to
include the individual MedDRA preferred terms ‘‘aphthous stomatitis, gingival pain, gingival ulceration, glossitis, mouth ulceration, oral discomfort, oral pain,
stomatitis, and mucosal inflammation.’’
AEs were stratified according to the presence or absence of concordant oral ulcers and duration. A database
was created to further evaluate potential relations between
AEs and oral lesions. Because the primary objectives were
to describe the clinical course of mTOR-associated oral
ulcers and to define their association with other toxicities,
no attempt was made to evaluate their relation to deforolimus dose or schedule. Clinical photographs of mucosal
ulcerations were obtained by investigators at 2 different
study sites.

RESULTS
The characteristics of the 2 study populations were similar
(Table 1). All patients had received prior treatment for
their primary tumors (Table 2). Primary tumor diagnoses
varied. The only tumor types with more than 2 patients
per diagnosis were renal cell carcinoma (19%), nonsmall

per diagnosis (2% each) were breast and bladder cancer,
gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor, leiomyosarcoma, and
liposarcoma. Thirty-six percent of tumor diagnoses
involved only a single patient.
Of the 78 patients in the interim dataset, AEs were
reported for 71 patients (91%). Mouth ulcers were
reported in 47 patients (66%), and these patients were
diagnosed with mIAS. The incidence of both mouthrelated and dermatologic-related AEs differed between
patients who had mIAS and those who did not (Table 3).

ventral tongue were noted in a patient who was receiving

and had a grayish-white center and a peripheral halo of erythema. The clinical presentation was consistent with that
noted in patients with minor aphthous stomatitis (herpetiform type).

frequency in patients with mIAS were dysgeusia (17% vs
4%), pharyngitis (19% vs 8%), and dysphagia (8.5% vs
0%). The dermatologic AEs that occurred with greater
frequency in patients with mIAS were nonspecific rashes
(62% vs 29%) and acneiform dermatitis (12.8% vs
4.2%). In contrast, the incidence of other gastrointestinalrelated AEs was similar in both patient groups (Table 3).
In general, mouth lesions (Figs. 1 and 2) appeared as
discrete, ovoid, superficial, well demarcated ulcers with a
grayish-white pseudomembrane and measured 1.0 cm
in greatest dimension (Figs. 1 and 2). Alternative presentations included a clustered distribution of lesions typical
of herpetiform aphthous and larger ulcers similar in
appearance to those observed in patients with major aphthous stomatitis. Lesions were confined to the nonkeratinized, movable mucosa, such as the inner aspect of the
lips, the ventral and lateral surfaces of the tongue, and the
soft palate. Clinical observations demonstrated that ulcers
developed acutely, typically peaking in severity within 5
days of deforolimus (AP23573) infusion, and, in the majority of cases, healed spontaneously without scarring in 4
to 5 days. Ulcers largely were accompanied by mouth
pain.
A higher proportion of mIAS patients than nonMIAS patients were neutropenic (19% vs 4%) and leukopenic (28% vs 17%), but myelosuppression was not a universal finding and was not associated with an increased
incidence of infection or sepsis (Table 1). The incidence

and non-mIAS patients.

DISCUSSION
Although mTOR inhibitors have been used as immunosuppressive agents in the management of solid organ
transplantation and graft-versus-host disease for some
time, their use in oncology is relatively new. Ulceration of
the oral mucosa reportedly is a frequent and dose-limiting
AE arising from the use of mTOR inhibitors in an anticancer setting.15,16 The term ‘‘mucositis’’ has been assigned
to these lesions despite the finding that, in widely used criteria for categorizing AEs (such as ICD-9 criteria, MedDRA, and NCI-CTCAE), mucositis tends to be associated
with cytotoxic drug and radiation treatment regimens for
cancer, whereas mTOR inhibitors are described more accurately as cytostatic. The studies reported herein suggested
that the aphthous-like mouth sores that characterize mIAS
are distinct from chemotherapy-associated mucositis (Fig.
3) based on their clinical presentation and their association
with other cotoxicities. Furthermore, the finding of aphthous-like lesions has been noted consistently in patients
who receive mTOR inhibitors for the immunosuppression
of solid transplantation rejection.7
The clinical presentation of mIAS closely resembles that of aphthous stomatitis. Lesions appear as
distinct, oval ulcers that have a central gray area surrounded by an erythematous band. mIAS ulcers are

213

Original Article

focal or multifocal, well demarcated ulcers that are present
in the movable oral mucosa. These self-limiting lesions
resemble aphthous oral ulcers and, unlike chemotherapyassociated mucositis, are not associated with other gastrointestinal signs. It is interesting to note that, if the pathogenesis of mIAS is similar to that of aphthous stomatitis,
which appears likely, then similar strategies for effective
intervention seem reasonable.18 Additional studies are
needed to establish factors associated with mIAS incidence, severity, and overall patterns, such as mTORinhibitor dose and schedule.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
Figure 3. Ulcerative mucositis associated with traditional
cytotoxic chemotherapy is shown. This patient had an extensive, deep ulceration of the ventral tongue. The pseudomembrane covering the ulcer was thicker than that observed on
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS) ulcers. Unlike mIAS, an erythematous halo was
absent. Typically, the architecture of mucositis-associated
ulcers is not defined as well as ulcers associated with mIAS.

localized to the movable mucosa of the mouth and
oropharynx and are not present on the more keratinized mucosa of the palate, gingiva, or dorsal surface
of the tongue, a finding that distinguishes them from
lesions of viral etiology. In general, the lesions of
mIAS have a more rapid onset than those of mucositis and resolve in approximately 1 week.
Although oral mucositis often occurs concurrent
with damage to other areas of the gastrointestinal tract,17
mIAS rarely does so. Among patients who are receiving
deforolimus, the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting was equivalent in patients with or without mIAS. In
contrast, mIAS was associated with the presence of cutaneous lesions: The incidence of nonspecific rash was
approximately 3 times higher in patients who experienced
mIAS than in those who did not.
Although the incidence of neutropenia was higher in
patients with mIAS than in patients without mIAS (19%
vs 4%), neutropenia was not a ubiquitous finding among
individuals with the condition. Nonetheless, the possibility that neutropenia contributes to the etiology of mIAS
cannot be disregarded given the similarity between the
clinical appearance of mIAS and that of oral lesions
observed in neutropenic patients.
The results of the current study suggest that mIAS is
a distinct entity from conventional chemotherapyinduced or radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis. The oral
lesions associated with mTOR inhibitors are discrete,
