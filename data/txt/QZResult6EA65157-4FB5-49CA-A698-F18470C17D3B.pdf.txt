ABSTRACT
Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) with internal tandem duplications (ITD) is
a major oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and confers an unfavorable
prognosis. Interference with FLT3ITD signaling is therefore pursued as a promising
therapeutic strategy. In this study we show that abrogation of FLT3ITD glycoprotein
maturation using low doses of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin has antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on FLT3ITD-expressing human and murine cell
lines. This effect is mediated in part by arresting FLT3ITD in an underglycosylated state
and thereby attenuating FLT3ITD-driven AKT and ERK signaling. In addition, tunicamycin
caused pronounced endoplasmatic reticulum stress and apoptosis through activation
of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activation of the
gene encoding CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). PERK
inhibition with a small molecule attenuated CHOP induction and partially rescued cells
from apoptosis. Combination of tunicamycin with potent FLT3ITD kinase inhibitors
caused synergistic cell killing, which was highly selective for cell lines and primary AML
cells expressing FLT3ITD. Although tunicamycin is currently not a clinically applicable
drug, we propose that mild inhibition of N-glycosylation may have therapeutic potential
in combination with FLT3 kinase inhibitors for FLT3ITD-positive AML.

INTRODUCTION

kinase domain–leads to strong constitutive activation
of the encoded kinase FLT3ITD, and is associated
with particularly bad prognosis [1, 4, 5]. Caused by its
constitutive kinase activity, the biogenesis of FLT3ITD
is impaired and cells harbor a relatively large amount
of immature, incompletely glycosylated FLT3ITD
protein [6]. Differential analysis of the signaling quality
of intracellular retained or surface-membrane located
FLT3ITD revealed qualitative differences. Intracellular
FLT3ITD, e.g. still bound to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) efficiently activates STAT5, a hallmark of cell

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a frequent form
of leukemia in adults. Despite significant improvements
in the past, treatment possibilities are still limited and
prognosis especially for elderly patients is unfavorable
[1, 2]. Among the different genetic aberrations associated
with AML, mutations in the gene encoding Fms-like
tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) are frequent [3]. The most
prevalent type of mutation – internal tandem duplications

transformation, whereas surface-bound FLT3ITD
activates AKT and ERK signaling [7, 8]. Both pools of
FLT3ITD thereby cooperate in cell transformation. Drugs
which further impair glycosylation of FLT3ITD were
found being anti-proliferative for FLT3ITD-positive AML
cells. One of these compounds is fluvastatin, a clinically
applied inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis, which
apart from blocking cholesterol synthesis also inhibits
N-glycosylation by depleting cells of dolicholphosphate
[9]. The other compound is 2-deoxy-D-glucose. This
compound depletes cells of ATP, but also impairs
N-glycosylation [10]. A possible reason for selective
inhibition of FLT3ITD-positive cells by compounds
affecting glycosylation may be a further shift of
FLT3ITD towards the intracellular localization, thereby
abrogating signaling from the cell surface and in turn
cell transformation. Tunicamycin is a bacterial antibiotic,
which specifically inhibits the transfer of activated sugars
to dolicholphosphate, an essential step in N-glycosylation
of proteins at the ER [11, 12]. Because of the fundamental
role of this process, tunicamycin has cytotoxic potential,
but at low or moderate doses, more specific effects on
different cell types have been observed. Tunicamycin
has been shown earlier to arrest underglycosylated
FLT3ITD in an ER-bound state and to promote STAT5
activation [7]. Moreover, tunicamycin was also shown
to reduce surface levels of other oncogenic membrane
receptors [13], and combined cytotoxic activity of
tunicamycin with different classes of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents has been demonstrated.
Importantly, despite its cytotoxicity, at least at higher
concentrations, effective doses of tunicamycin for
experimental tumor therapy were found tolerable in
mice in vivo, e.g. in xenotransplantation models of
hepatocellular carcinoma and glioma [13, 14]. The
cytotoxic activity of tunicamycin on cancer cells has also
been related to the generation of ER-stress through the
“unfolded protein response (UPR)”. ER-stress inducing
agents including tunicamycin could be combined with
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to cause regression of
Ras-driven solid tumors in vivo [15]. Here we explored
the previously not addressed potential of tunicamycin as
targeted therapy for FLT3ITD-positive AML. Applied at
rather low concentrations, the compound exhibited mild
cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on different cell lines. In
FLT3ITD-harboring cells, ER-stress through activation
of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum
kinase (PERK) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein
homologous protein (CHOP), as well as inhibition of
FLT3ITD glycosylation and thereby attenuation of AKT
and ERK activation contributed to growth arrest and
apoptosis induction. In combination with FLT3 kinase
inhibitors, tunicamycin exhibited a strong and specific
synergy in killing of FLT3ITD-expressing cell lines and
primary AML cells.

Low doses of tunicamycin inhibit FLT3ITD
glycosylation and attenuate AKT and ERK
activation
Selective anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of
compounds which, among other cellular activities, affect
protein N-glycosylation for FLT3ITD-expressing cells
have previously been reported. We therefore intended
to determine if tunicamycin, a compound whose only
known activity is the specific and selective inhibition
of N-glycosylation [11], may likewise be selectively
cytostatic or even cytotoxic for such cells. The potential
of tunicymycin for such a therapeutic approach has
previously not been assessed. To determine a meaningful
dose-range for such experiments, we initially analyzed
the effect of tunicamycin on FLT3ITD glycosylation
and the induction of ER-stress. We used the human cell
line MV4-11 with endogenous biallelic expression of
FLT3ITD for these experiments. As shown in Figure 1A,
treatment of these cells with doses of tunicamycin as
low as 0.05–0.1 µg/ml were sufficient to markedly
reduce the formation of fully glycosylated FLT3ITD
and led to accumulation of underglycosylated species.
While inhibition of glycosylation also caused reduction
in the amount of phosphorylated complex glycosylated
receptor, phosphorylation of underglycosylated (ERarrested) FLT3ITD species was reduced but still clearly
detectable. FLT3ITD constitutively activates STAT5, AKT
and ERK signaling, which can be robustly detected in cell
lysates (Figure 1A). As reported earlier (albeit with much
higher tunicamycin concentrations) [7], the tunicamycin
treatment at the employed low doses significantly
attenuated AKT and ERK activation, and enhanced
activation of STAT5 (Figure 1B). Similar observations
were made when using MOLM13 cells, another human
AML cell line with endogenous FLT3ITD expression
(Supplementary Figure 1).

Tunicamycin induces apoptosis through
generation of ER-stress
Treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells
with tunicamycin alone caused a dose-dependent
inhibition of the amount of viable cells as scored by
3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays (Figure 2A) and promoted
apoptosis detected by Annexin V binding (Figure 2B).
While inhibition in MTT assays was similar for both cell
lines, apoptosis induction was clearly more pronounced
for MV4-11 than for MOLM13 cells, suggesting that
tunicamycin is anti-proliferative in both cell lines, but
significantly more cytotoxic for MV4-11 cells. Given that
FLT3ITD-driven AKT and ERK signaling in both cell lines

26614

was only partially inhibited and not abrogated, apoptosis
induction appeared to be not exclusively mediated
through inhibition of FLT3ITD signal transduction.
Similar observations were made in FLT3ITD expressing
32D cells. Tunicamycin reduced cell growth assessed by
MTT assays, but the cells were refractory to tunicamycininduced apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 2). Tunicamycin
also promoted apoptosis of cells which do not express
FLT3ITD. These included parental 32D cells, and wildtype FLT3-expressing 32D cells, which were analyzed in
the presence of IL-3 (Supplementary Figure 3A). Also,
viability of U937 cells, which are not transformed by a
transmembrane oncoprotein, was inhibited by relatively
low concentrations of tunicamycin. In contrast, K562
cells, which are transformed by the cytoplasmic oncogenic
tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL, were comparatively resistant
to the compound (Supplementary Figure 3B).
As reported earlier, arrest of glycoprotein biogenesis
by tunicamycin causes ER-stress and this can translate
into cytotoxicity [16, 17]. Indeed, the expression of two
marker genes of ER-stress and UPR, GRP78/BiP and
CHOP [18, 19], was greatly enhanced upon treatment
with tunicamycin within the dose-range found to be
cytotoxic for the FLT3ITD expressing human AML cell
lines (Figure 2C, 2D). Similar observations were made
in murine 32D cells stably expressing FLT3ITD, except
that the tunicamycin concentrations required for ERstress induction were significantly higher (Supplementary
Figure 2A–2C). ER-stress mediated activation of CHOP
occurs downstream of activated PERK [20]. Recently,

potent and selective PERK inhibitors (PERKi) have been
developed, including GSK2606414, which has been shown
to rescue ER-stress induced apoptosis in neuronal cells
in vitro and in vivo [21]. We employed this compound for
assessing the possible contribution of the PERK-CHOP
pathway to tunicamycin-induced apoptosis in MV4-11
cells. Indeed, GSK2606414 potently inhibited CHOP
activation in these cells but had no effect on tunicamycininduced GRP78/BiP induction, which occurs downstream
of the ER-stress sensing inositol-requiring enzyme 1
(IRE1) [20] (Figure 2E, 2F). Importantly, the PERKi
also efficiently attenuated tunicamycin-induced apoptosis
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2G). This indicates
that the PERK/CHOP pathway causally contributes to
apoptosis induction.
FLT3ITD has previously been reported to cause
enhanced formation of reactive-oxygen species (ROS) in
AML cells [22–24]. An interplay of ER-stress and ROS
formation has likewise been reported [25]. Promoting ROS
formation in cancer cells beyond a tolerable threshold has
been proposed earlier as a strategy for inducing selective
cytotoxicity [26]. We therefore considered the possibility
that tunicamycin-mediated ER-stress or FLT3ITD ERretention may enhance ROS formation beyond such
toxic threshold, and in turn cause apoptosis. As reported
earlier [23, 24], ROS formation in cells with endogenous
FLT3ITD expression such as MV4-11 was readily
detected, and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
attenuated ROS formation (Supplementary Figure  4A).
However, tunicamycin did not further enhance ROS

endogenous FLT3 ITD were treated with the indicated doses of tunicamycin for 24 h. (A) Cell lysates were prepared and whole-cell lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. CG, complex glycosylated form; HM, high-mannose
form; PG, partially glycosylated; DG, deglycosylated. Assignments of molecular masses were done by comparison with marker proteins,
assignment of the forms was based on these masses and previous observations [6]. Elevated pan-FLT3 signals at higher tunicamycin doses
may be a consequence of better recognition of less phosphorylated receptor by the FLT3 antibodies. (B) Quantification of three independent
experiments (mean ± SD; *significant differences from values in the untreated control).

formation (Supplementary Figure 4B). Consistent with
this observation, NAC treatment failed to rescue MV4-11
cells from tunicamycin-induced apoptosis (Figure 2H).
Taken together, attenuation of FLT3ITD-driven
AKT and ERK signaling and tunicamycin-induced PERKCHOP activation, but not ROS formation, were implicated

in apoptosis induction. Deglycosylation of further yet
unidentified glycoproteins may also mediate cytotoxic
effects. It can be assumed that differential importance
and regulation of these pathways contributes to the very
different apoptotic responses of the different analyzed cell
lines to tunicamycin exposure.

the Annexin V method (B). Data are means ± SD; A, n = 4; B, n = 3. (C, D) MV4-11 or MOLM13 cells were treated with the indicated

(H) ROS quenching by N-acetylcysteine has no influence on tunicamycin-induced apoptosis (means ± SD; n = 2; n.s., not significant;

and H) the quantitative apoptotic response to tunicamycin at a given concentration varied, possibly related to different tunicamycin batches.
Therefore scales in these panels were adjusted to the maximal responses.

inhibitors

was more pronounced in MV4-11 than in MOLM13
cells (Figure 3C, 3D). Here even very low tunicamycin
concentrations enhanced AC220-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure 5). We also assessed the potential
effect of AC220 in combination with fluvastatin, a
clinically approved mevalonate-synthesis inhibitor, which
has been shown to block N-glycosylation of FLT3ITD [9].
Consistent with previously published data, the combination
of AC220 and fluvastatin resulted in enhanced inhibition
of growth and promotion of apoptosis of MV4-11 cells
(Supplementary Figure 6A, 6B). However, the effect
of fluvastatin on N-glycosylation in these cells was less
pronounced than in other cells [9] (data not shown),
suggesting that additional mechanisms may contribute to
fluvastatin-induced cytotoxicity in this setting.

Next, we explored the effect of tunicamycin in
combination with the selective FLT3ITD tyrosine kinase
inhibitor AC220 (quizartinib), a compound currently
in advanced clinical trials for treatment of FLT3ITD
positive AML [27]. As reported, AC220 very potently
inhibited viability of MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells
(Figure 3A, 3B) and promoted apoptosis (Figure 3C, 3D).
Importantly, co-incubation with even low concentrations
of tunicamycin strongly enhanced AC220-mediated
inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure 3A, 3B). Moreover,
AC220-evoked apoptosis was also promoted. This effect

MV4-11 cells or MOLM13 cells were treated simultaneously with the indicated concentrations of AC220 and tunicamycin.
Subsequently the amount of viable cells was measured by MTT conversion after 72 h. Combination indices were determined
according to the method of Chou-Talalay [31]. Combinations with synergism (CI < 1) are highlighted grey.
We also tested the combination of tunicamycin with
other clinically relevant FLT3 inhibitors. We assessed
the combined activity with ponatinib, a multikinase type
2-inhibitor [28], with crenolanib, a selective FLT3 type
1-inhibitor [29], and with PKC412 (midostaurin), a FLT3
inhibitor, which will become approved for treatment of
FLT3ITD positive AML in the near future [30]. Tunicamycin
enhanced the activity of all three compounds as seen
by growth inhibition of MV4-11 cells (Figure 3E–3G).
These findings indicate that the observed synergism of
tunicamycin with FLT3 inhibitors is a more general effect.
When analyzed by the method of Chou-Talalay
[31], the combinations of tunicamycin with all tested
FLT3 kinase inhibitors were clearly synergistic in certain
dose-ranges (Tables 1, 2; Supplementary Tables 1, 2).
For example, all tested tunicamycin concentrations
synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effect of 2 nM
AC220 in MTT assays with MV4-11, MOLM13, and also
FLT3ITD-expressing 32D cells (Table 1, Supplementary
Table 1), and of 2 nM crenolanib with MV4-11 cells
(Table 2). Ponatinib showed synergy with tunicamycin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

preferentially at 1 and 2 nM, whereas synergy with
PKC412 was only seen at 50 nM of this FLT3 inhibitor.
Synergy in apoptosis induction with MV4-11 cells was
observed in all tested AC220/tunicamycin combinations,
but the effect was particularly pronounced at low doses of
tunicamycin (Supplementary Table 1).

Specificity of the combined treatment for
FLT3ITD expressing cells
To explore the specificity of combining tunicamycin
and AC220 for cytotoxicity we compared isogenic 32D
cells either expressing FLT3ITD or wild-type FLT3.
These experiments were performed in the absence of IL-3.
As shown in Figure 4, a dose-dependent induction of
apoptosis by AC220 in the FLT3ITD-expressing cells was
clearly enhanced by adding tunicamycin to the treatment.
In contrast, in 32D cells with wild-type FLT3 the basal rate
of apoptosis was somewhat higher due to IL-3 starvation,
but was not increased by AC220 treatment, neither in
absence nor in presence of tunicamycin. Consequently, no

combinatorial effect of AC220 was observed in these cells,
whereas a clear synergy of tunicamycin with AC220 was
detectable in FLT3ITD expressing 32D cells (Table 3).
Consistent with these findings, a pronounced synergy of
tunicamycin with AC220-mediated inhibition in 32D cells
expressing FLT3ITD was also observed in MTT assays
(Supplementary Figure 7, Supplementary Table 2).
We further assessed the effect of the combination of
tunicamycin and AC220 on primary human AML cells. In
the absence of cytokines cells were treated with vehicle,
AC220, tunicamycin, or their combination. Apoptosis was
assessed after 24 h of treatment. As shown in Figure 4C,
the combination of both agents was selectively cytotoxic
for FLT3ITD-positive primary AML cells, but did not
affect wild-type FLT3 expressing primary cells. Moreover,
normal human bone-marrow derived mononuclear cells
(BMMCs) as well as CD34 positive stem- and progenitor
cells were resistant to combined tunicamycin and AC220
treatment (Figure 4D).
Taken together, while tunicamycin was not
selectively cytotoxic for FLT3ITD-expressing cells as a
single compound, it exhibited a pronounced synergy with
different clinically relevant FLT3 inhibitors for FLT3ITDexpressing cell lines and primary AML cells. Importantly,
cell lines and primary AML cells expressing wild-type
FLT3 were resistant to the treatment, as were primary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

human bone-marrow cells, including CD34-positive
progenitor cells.

DISCUSSION
The main finding of this study is the synergistic
enhancement of cytotoxic effects of FLT3ITD kinase
inhibition with low doses of tunicamycin in AML cell lines
and primary, FLT3ITD-positive AML cells. Tunicamycin
is currently not a clinically applicable drug. However,
given that tunicamycin at low doses appears to be well
tolerated in vivo in mouse models [13, 14], and was
not markedly cytotoxic to normal human CD34+ bonemarrow cells, our findings suggest that further assessment
of FLT3 inhibitor/tunicamycin combinations in preclinical
AML models may be warranted.
Our results confirm and extend previous findings on
the cytotoxic effect of mild inhibition of N-glycosylation
for FLT3ITD-transformed cells. Low doses of tunicamycin
were shown to efficiently inhibit N-glycosylation of
FLT3ITD. In turn, FLT3ITD-driven AKT and ERK
activation, both dependent on a fully glycosylated
FLT3 receptor at the plasma membrane [7, 8], was
attenuated (schematically illustrated in Figure 5). This
effect is likely contributing to inhibition of FLT3ITDmediated transformation and presents a relatively
26619

specific mechanism for interference with the activity
of this oncoprotein. Enhanced activation of STAT5 in
presence of tunicamycin, which was also observed, is
not expected to mediate growth inhibition. Indeed, cotreatment of cells with pimozide, a STAT5 inhibiting
drug, did not rescue cells from growth arrest and apoptosis
induced by tunicamycin (data not shown). Inhibition of
N-glycosylation will occur also for other glycoproteins,
causing the generation of ER-stress as indicated by the

observed induction of ER-stress response genes. Inhibition
of PERK attenuated the ER-stress mediated induction
of CHOP, and partially rescued apoptosis induction by
tunicamycin. These data identify the PERK-CHOP axis
as a relevant pathway for the promotion of apoptosis by
tunicamycin in FLT3ITD-positive AML cells (Figure 5).
This general mechanism, however, likely also contributes
to cytotoxic effects of tunicamycin in cell lines, which
do not express FLT3ITD. Importantly, studies of ROS

formation and failure of the ROS quencher NAC to
attenuate tunicamycin-induced apoptosis render a
contribution of ROS unlikely.
Previous reports have suggested a selective
cytotoxic potential of inhibiting N-glycosylation for
FLT3ITD-expressing cells [9, 10]. The lipid-lowering
drug fluvastatin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose were both shown
to inhibit N-glycosylation of FLT3ITD and c-Kit mutants
and to selectively inhibit growth of FLT3ITD- or mutant
c-Kit expressing cells. Treatment with these drugs reduced
cell-surface expression of both receptors, which correlated
with the cytostatic/cytotoxic response. For fluvastatin,
promotion of STAT5 activation but inhibition of ERK and
AKT activation was shown and interpreted as consequence
of the shift of underglycosylated FLT3ITD/c-Kit to the
intracellular pool [9]. Consistent with this earlier report,
we observed cytotoxic effects of fluvastatin for FLT3ITDpositive cells, and a strong enhancement of the effect of
the FLT3 inhibitor AC220. For the reported effects of
2-deoxy-D-glucose, inhibition of FLT3ITD levels were
also observed and attributed to underglycosylation of Sp1,
a transcription factor positively regulating c-Kit and FLT3
gene expression [10]. Given the broader cellular effects
of both compounds, further mechanisms, in addition to
inhibition of N-glycosylation, may contribute to their
activity as single agents and their relative selectivity.
According to our data, the specific inhibition of
N-glycosylation per se by tunicamycin is not sufficiently
selective for inhibition of FLT3ITD-mediated cell
transformation. However, in conjunction with selective

FLT3ITD tyrosine-kinase inhibition, interference with
N-glycosylation acts in a synergistic manner and has the
potential to serve as a cytotoxic principle for FLT3ITDpositive AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The human cells lines MV4-11, MOLM13, U937
and K562 were obtained from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
(Braunschweig, Germany) and cultivated in RMPI1640
medium containing bicarbonate and glutamine (R8758
Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Parental
32D cells and cell pools transduced with constructs
expressing wild-type FLT3 or FLT3ITD [32] were kindly
provided by Drs. Hubert Serve (University Hospital
Münster, Germany), and Justus Duyster and Rebekka
Grundler (Hospital of the Technical University Munich,
Germany). They were cultivated in RPMI1640 medium
without bicarbonate, buffered with HEPES and containing
glutamine (FG1235, Biochrome AG, Berlin, Germany),
supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10% heatinactivated FBS, and 1 ng/ml murine IL-3.
Tunicamycin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany). AC220 was obtained by chemical
synthesis as described [33]. Ponatinib and crenolanib were
obtained from Selleckchem (through Biozol, Eching,
Germany). PKC412 was from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen,

Figure 5: Mechanisms involved in growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by combined treatment of FLT3ITDpositive AML cells with tunicamycin and FLT3 inhibitors. (A) Two pools of FLT3ITD are important for cell transformation.

The pool at the plasma membrane effectively activates ERK and AKT. The intracellular FLT3ITD pool at the ER is the consequence of
inefficient biogenesis of FLT3ITD caused by constitutive kinase activity. This pool efficiently activates STAT5. (B) Tunicamycin treatment
arrests FLT3ITD at the ER in an underglycosylated state. This leads to attenuation of ERK and AKT signaling. Moreover, an ER-stress
response is elicited. ER-stress sensing kinases such as inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic
reticulum kinase (PERK) are activated and promote activation of stress response genes, such as GRP78/BiP and CHOP, respectively
(the latter not shown). Inhibition of ERK and AKT activation and induction of ER-stress can mediate growth inhibition and apoptosis.
(C) Simultaneous treatment with FLT3 inhibitors and tunicamycin causes selective cell killing by combined abrogation of FLT3ITD kinase
signaling, and induction of ER-stress preferentially through PERK activation.

Germany). All compound treatments were done at a
final DMSO concentration of 0.1 %. SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting, and determination of viability using MTT
were performed as described earlier [8]. Immunoblots were
acquired using an LAS4000 luminescence imager, and
quantification of immunoblots was performed using Multi
Gauge image software (Fujifilm, Düsseldorf, Germany).
Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using PElabeled Annexin V (559763, BD Bioscience Heidelberg,
Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
All work with human primary cells was performed
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and
approved by ethic votes of the institutional review board
of the University Hospital Jena. Primary AML cells were
isolated from peripheral blood as described earlier [24] and
cryopreserved at a cell density of 2–5 × 107 cells /ml. The
cells were thawed and cultivated in StemSpanTM SFEM
II medium (09605 STEMCELL Technologies Cologne,
Germany) supplemented with rh-G-CSF rh-SCF, rh-IL-3
and rh-IL-6 (11343133 12343323 11340033 11340063
Immunotools Friesoythe, Germany respectively) for
24 h as described [23]. Thereafter, cells were washed,
and treated in the absence of cytokines with the different
compounds in StemSpanTM SFEM II medium for 24 h,
apoptosis of FLT3-positive cells was determined by
flow cytometry using FITC-labeled Annexin V (556420
BD Bioscience Heidelberg, Germany), and PE-labeled
human CD135 antibody (558996 BD Bioscience
Heidelberg, Germany) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer.
Normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BMMCs) were obtained by a standard procedure using
Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Biocoll S0115, Biochrom
AG, Berlin, Germany) from freshly aspirated bone
marrow. The cells were washed, seeded and treated with
compounds in StemSpanTM SFEM II medium in the
absence of cytokines. Apoptosis was determined by flow
cytometry using FITC-labeled Annexin V according to
the instructions of the manufacturer in both CD34+ and
CD34- cells. Gating of CD34+ cells was achieved using
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PE-labeled human CD34 antibody (343605, Biolegend,
San Diego, CA, USA). To assess synergy of drug
treatments, the program CalcuSyn (Biosoft, Cambridge,
UK) was used. The program calculates the Combination
Index (CI) according to the algorithm of Chou-Talalay
[31]. A CI < 1 indicates synergy of drug action.
To determine the induction of ER-stress, expression
of the genes encoding BiP and CHOP were determined
by RT-qPCR. Isolation of total RNA and cDNA synthesis
were performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Heidelberg, Germany), and the cDNA synthesis kit of
ThermoFisher Scientific (K1612, Schwerte, Germany),
respectively, according to the instructions of the
manufacturers. A SYBR Green kit was used for qPCR
(ThermoFisher Scientific K0221, Schwerte, Germany)
with the annealing temperatures adjusted to the different
primer pairs: hBiP GAAAGAAGGTTACCCATGCAGT
(fwd) CAGGCCATAAGCAATAGCAGC (rev) (60°C);
mBip GGGAAAGAAGGTTACCCATGC (fwd) CGAGTA

ACCAGCAGA GGTCACA (fwd) AGCTGTGCCACT
TTCCTTTC (rev) (60°C); mChop CCCTGCCTTTCA
CCTTGG (fwd) CCGCTCGTTCTCCTGCTC (rev)
(56°C). As reference genes hGAPDH and mbActin were
also analyzed. The reactions were performed according to
the recommendations of the manufacturer.
For signal transduction analysis, 2 × 106 cells
per sample were incubated with the tunicamycin
concentrations indicated in the figure legends for 24 h. Cell
extraction and analysis of signaling by immunoblotting
were performed as described earlier [8].
Statistical analyses were performed with one-way
or two-way ANOVA as applicable, using the HolmSidak method for multiple pairwise comparisons and the
program SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany).
