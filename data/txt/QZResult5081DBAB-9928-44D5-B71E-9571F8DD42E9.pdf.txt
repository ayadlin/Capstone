Increased Risk of Histologically Defined Cancer Subtypes in
Human Immunodeficiency Virus–Infected Individuals
Clues for Possible Immunosuppression-Related or Infectious Etiology
Meredith S. Shiels, PhD, MHS and Eric A. Engels, MD, MPH

BACKGROUND: Malignancies that occur in excess among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals may be caused
by immunosuppression or infections. Because histologically defined cancer subtypes have not been systematically evaluated, their
risk was assessed among people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). METHODS: Analyses included 569,268 people
with AIDS from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, a linkage of 15 US population-based HIV/AIDS and cancer registries during 1980 to
2007. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer risk in people with AIDS to the general population
overall, and stratified by age, calendar period (a proxy of changing HIV therapies), and time since onset of AIDS (a proxy of immunosuppression). RESULTS: Sixteen individual cancer histologies or histology groupings manifested significantly elevated SIRs. Risks
were most elevated for adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (SIR ¼ 11.3), neoplasms of histiocytes and accessory lymphoid cells (SIR ¼
10.7), giant cell carcinoma (SIR ¼ 7.51), and leukemia not otherwise specified (SIR ¼ 6.69). SIRs ranged from 1.4 to 4.6 for spindle cell
carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma, adnexal and skin appendage neoplasms, sarcoma not otherwise specified, spindle
cell sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, mesothelioma, germ cell tumors, plasma cell tumors, immunoproliferative diseases, acute lymphocytic
leukemia, and myeloid leukemias. For several of these cancer subtypes, significant declines in SIRs were observed across calendar
periods (consistent with decreasing risk with improved HIV therapies) or increase in SIRs with time since onset of AIDS (ie, prolonged
immunosuppression). CONCLUSIONS: The elevated risk of certain cancer subtypes in people with AIDS may point to an etiologic role
of immunosuppression or infection. Future studies are needed to further investigate these associations and evaluate candidate infecC 2012 American Cancer Society.

Individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased risk of developing a number of cancers
compared to the general population.1,2 In particular, the risk of cancers with infectious etiologies far exceeds the risk in the
general population, due to HIV-induced immune suppression and an increased prevalence of some oncogenic infections.3
Indeed, these elevated risks have provided important clues to cancer etiology. For example, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a 53,000-fold increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) compared to the general population at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic.2 This observation led to the hypothesis that KS may be caused by a virus,
which subsequently resulted in the discovery of KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in 1994.4 More recently, HIV was
reported to be associated with a 13-fold increase in the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma,5 a rare type of skin cancer. This elevation suggested a potential infectious etiology and led to the 2008 discovery of Merkel cell polyomavirus, the possible agent
of Merkel cell carcinoma.6 In addition, HIV is associated with a 77-fold elevated risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and an
11-fold elevated risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (both caused by Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]), a 5-fold elevated risk of liver cancer (caused by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus), and a 6-fold elevated risk of cervical cancer and 29-fold elevated risk
of anal cancer (both caused by human papillomavirus).1-3
Previous work describing the risk of malignancies among HIV-infected individuals has commonly grouped cancers
based on the primary site.1,2,7 It is increasingly recognized that within a given cancer site, there is etiologic heterogeneity,
and that risk factors may differ across histologic subtypes. Although HIV does not increase the risk of most common cancers, these broad classifications may mask associations between HIV and less common cancer entities. Cancers that may
have been missed could plausibly correspond to unique histologic subtypes that can be diagnosed across multiple anatomic

sites, or rare entities that would not contribute substantially to overall risk at a site. In this study, we therefore
evaluated the risk of individual histologic subtypes of cancer in persons with AIDS, relative to the general population. A potential etiologic role of immunosuppression or
infection may be indicated for such malignancies if they
occur in excess among HIV-infected individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our analyses used data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer
Match (HACM) Study, a linkage of population-based
HIV/AIDS and cancer registries in 15 US areas (additional information at www.hivmatch.cancer.gov).8 A
probabilistic algorithm was used to match records based
on name, Social Security number, sex, birth date, death
date, and race.8 Only anonymized data were retained by
investigators. The study was approved by institutional
review boards at each participating registry.
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O3) topography and histology
codes were used to classify cancers.9 We identified individual histologic subtypes of cancer that may occur more
frequently in persons with AIDS than in the general population by estimating the proportion of cases in HACM
cancer registries that matched to AIDS registries. We estimated the proportion of cancer cases with AIDS for 659
histology codes. Each individual histology code where
1% of cancer registry cases matched to the AIDS registry
in any of 3 age groups (persons aged 0-19, 20-49, and
50 years) was identified for further analyses. Upon
review of the initial results, we collapsed related histology
codes into categories and identified histology categories
where 1% of cases matched to the AIDS registry. For
example, the category ‘‘immunoproliferative disease’’
includes immunoproliferative diseases, not otherwise
specified (NOS; ICD-O3 code 9760), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (ICD-O3 code 9761), and heavy chain
disease, NOS (ICD-O3 code 9762). We excluded histologies that are classified by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention as AIDS-defining cancers (eg, KS, Burkitt
lymphoma)10 or have well-established associations with
HIV infection (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma).3
To assess the risk of each histologic subtype of interest in persons with AIDS relative to the general population, we estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).
This analysis included persons with AIDS who contributed follow-up from the start of registry coverage or 60
months prior to AIDS onset (whichever occurred later) to
the earliest of death, end of complete registry coverage, or
4870

120 months after AIDS onset. Cancers diagnosed during
1980 to 2007 were identified from the cancer registries.
SIRs were calculated as the number of observed cases
among persons with AIDS divided by the number of
expected cases, where expected cases were based on rates
from cancer registry data and standardized by age, sex,
race, calendar year, and registry to the AIDS population.
Expected counts corresponding to prevalent cancers
occurring before or at AIDS onset were adjusted for survival bias.
We then focused on malignancies for which the SIR
was significantly elevated (P < .05), and there were at least
5 cases among persons with AIDS. We estimated SIRs
stratified by attained age group (0-14, 15-29, 30-49, and
50 years old), time relative to AIDS onset (60 to 25
months, 24 to 7 months, 6 to þ3 months, þ4 to
þ27 months, þ28 to þ60 months, and þ61 to þ120
months), and attained calendar period (no antiretroviral
therapy era, 1980-1989; some antiretroviral therapy era,
1990-1995; early highly active antiretroviral therapy
[HAART] era, 1996-2000; and late HAART era, 20012007). Tests for trend in SIRs across strata were assessed
with Poisson regression. Examining patterns of elevated
cancer risk across calendar periods and time since AIDS
diagnosis may further support the role of immune suppression or coinfections. Decreasing risk over calendar
time suggests that immune reconstitution (ie, HAART)
reduces cancer risk, and increasing risk with time since
AIDS suggests that advanced immune suppression
increases cancer risk. The period 6 months before to 3
months after AIDS onset was excluded from the trend test
for time relative to AIDS onset, because increased medical
surveillance inflates cancer rates during this time period.11
All statistical tests were 2-sided. P  .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
The HACM Study includes 569,268 individuals with
AIDS who contributed follow-up during 1980 to 2007.
Subjects were primarily male (80.2%) with an equal proportion of non-Hispanic whites (38.4%) and non-Hispanic blacks (40.5%), and fewer Hispanics (21.1%). The
median age at AIDS onset was 37 years. The most common HIV transmission risk group was men who have sex
with men (MSM) (43.6%), followed by injection drug
users (IDUs) (24.4%), and MSM/IDUs (5.8%); people
with other or unspecified risk groups comprised 26.2% of
the population.
The vast majority of the 659 individual histology
codes examined were not identified as having an AIDS

carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. However, based on our search approach, we identified 16 individual histologic subtypes or histology
groupings where SIRs were significantly elevated in persons with AIDS (Table 1). The most common of these
cancers were germ cell tumors (n ¼ 340), plasma cell
tumors (n ¼ 290), and myeloid leukemias (n ¼ 283). The
majority of giant cell carcinomas (92.9%), spindle cell
carcinomas (54.5%), and bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinomas (96.6%) occurred in the lung. Germ cell tumors

AIDS: malignant histiocytosis (SIR ¼ 12.5) and histiocytic sarcoma (SIR ¼ 24.5). Risk was strongly elevated for
some histologic entities localized to the lung: giant cell
carcinomas (SIR ¼ 8.35), spindle cell sarcomas (SIR ¼

germ cell tumors, risk was significantly elevated for testes
seminoma (SIR ¼ 1.44), but not testes nonseminoma
(SIR ¼ 1.14). In addition, the elevated risk of adnexal and

DISCUSSION
We identified 16 histologically defined cancers, characterized as individual histologic subtypes or histology groups
that were significantly elevated in persons with AIDS
compared with the general population. These diverse
malignancies, many of which are uncommon, include
specific carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematological malignancies, as well as germ cell and plasma cell tumors. The
risks of some of these malignancies have been shown in
previous studies to be elevated in HIV-infected individuals,2,3,12-16 whereas the occurrence of others has not been
evaluated previously. The increased risk of these cancers
among individuals with AIDS supports an etiologic role
of immune suppression or infection. As we discuss further
below, additional considerations in weighing this possibility include the magnitude of the increased risk; changes in
cancer risk with advanced HIV infection or introduction
of effective HIV therapy; and other available biological,
clinical, or epidemiologic data.
Two of these cancers, leiomyosarcoma and adult T
cell leukemia/lymphoma, have been previously linked to
infection with EBV17 and human T lymphotropic virus
1,18 respectively. In our study, leiomyosarcoma risk was
elevated 2-fold overall, but more than 500-fold in children aged 0 to 14 years, compared with the general population. Previous studies have described this increased risk
in children,12 and have shown that, in contrast to leiomyosarcomas in HIV-uninfected individuals, those arising in HIV-infected individuals are largely EBVpositive.17 SIRs for leiomyosarcoma increased with time
since AIDS onset, suggesting that prolonged immune
suppression increases leiomyosarcoma risk. The risk of
adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, which is caused by
infection with human T lymphotropic virus 1,18 was
strongly elevated in the AIDS population, as observed previously.13 Risk declined over calendar time, indicating a
potential protective effect related to HAART. However,
the excess risk of T cell leukemia/lymphoma may also be
due to misclassification of B cell lymphomas, which are
known to be strongly associated with HIV infection.
Infectious etiologies have not been established for the
remaining cancers identified in our study. Although it has
4874

been suggested that infection with simian virus 40, which
contaminated some polio vaccines in the 1950s and 1960s,
may be associated with the development of mesothelioma,
the most recent laboratory and epidemiologic studies have
not supported this hypothesis.19,20 Furthermore, mumps
virus, EBV, human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and
parvovirus B19 have each been suggested, but not established, as potentially associated with germ cell tumors of
the testes.14,21,22 As we report here, persons with AIDS
have an elevated risk for testicular seminoma.14 Associations with hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus have been
reported for immunoproliferative diseases and, in particular, Waldenström macroglobulinemia.23,24
Prior studies have shown an increased risk of multiple
myeloma in HIV-infected individuals and immunosuppressed transplant recipients.3 Case reports describe detection of EBV in tumor cells from immunosuppressed
multiple myeloma cases,25 and 1 case-control study found
an association with hepatitis B virus.26 However, other
studies have shown no associations with these viruses.23,27
Although the declining risk of plasma cell tumors over time
suggests that HAART may reduce the risk of these cancers,
the decrease in risk following AIDS onset is difficult to
explain. Risk of appendageal carcinomas has previously
been shown to be elevated in persons with AIDS16 and possibly transplant recipients.28 Neoplasms of histiocytes and
accessory lymphoid cells include malignant histiocytosis
and histiocytic sarcoma. These rare malignancies are
strongly elevated in persons with AIDS. Some case reports
have described detection of EBV in these tumors,29,30 and
a possible role of immunosuppression is supported by our
observation of a decline in risk over calendar time.
HIV-infected persons have an elevated risk of developing lung cancer, even after accounting for a high prevalence of tobacco use.15 We identified 3 uncommon cancer
subtypes occurring primarily in the lung where risk was
elevated in persons with AIDS. Ninety-three percent of
giant cell carcinomas, 55% of spindle cell carcinomas, and
97% of bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinomas identified in
this study occurred in the lung. These histologic subtypes
of lung cancer vary in their behavior and associations with
cigarette smoking. Giant cell and spindle cell carcinomas
of the lung are classified as sarcomatoid carcinomas and
comprise 0.3% to 1.3% of all lung malignancies.31 More
than 90% of sarcomatoid carcinomas occur in heavy
smokers.31 Given the rarity of these malignancies, it is
possible that some may be misclassified cases of pulmonary KS. Bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma occurs
along alveolar structures of the lung without pleural, vascular, or stromal invasion, and is more weakly associated

with tobacco smoking.32 HAART may reduce the risk of
bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma in HIV-infected
individuals, because the relative risk in persons with AIDS
declined over time. Although a high prevalence of smoking in HIV-infected individuals may be driving the elevated risk of these 3 cancer histologies, it is possible that
HIV-related immune disturbance, pulmonary inflammation, or lung infections also contribute.33
Finally, we identified several additional sarcomas
and hematological malignancies that occur at increased
frequency in persons with AIDS. The risks of 2 poorly
specified types of sarcoma (ie, sarcoma NOS and spindle
cell sarcoma) were elevated 17-fold and 5-fold, respectively in persons with AIDS. The elevated risk of sarcoma
NOS, which was most pronounced in MSM, probably
reflects poorly classified KS cases. Spindle cell sarcoma
may also reflect misclassified KS or possibly leiomyosarcoma.34 Consistent with previous studies that have shown
an increased risk of broadly grouped lymphomas and leukemias in HIV-infected individuals,2,3 we found elevations for acute lymphocytic leukemia and myeloid
leukemia.
The main strength of our analysis was the use of data
from the HACM Study, which includes 569,268 persons
with AIDS who were followed over the duration of the
AIDS epidemic. Because of the large number of persons
with AIDS included in the HACM Study, we were able to
examine the risk of specific histologic subtypes and less
common malignancies, which have not been previously
assessed and would be impossible to evaluate in a smaller
sample. Because the analyses presented here were exploratory, the results should be interpreted with caution. We
examined, but did not present, a large number of associations with largely null results, and did not correct for multiple comparisons. Nonetheless, the purpose of this study
was to generate hypotheses and identify potentially intriguing areas for future research.
In conclusion, persons with AIDS are at an increased
risk of developing a number of histologically defined
malignancies. Many of these malignances are rare and lack
strong a priori evidence for a potential role for infection or
immune suppression. Nonetheless, the markedly
increased risk for some of these entities is striking, and in
the absence of other compelling explanations, it may be
productive to further investigate these associations and
evaluate candidate infectious agents.
