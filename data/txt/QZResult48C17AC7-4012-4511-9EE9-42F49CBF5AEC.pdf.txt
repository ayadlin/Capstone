Abstract
CD22 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by mature B cells. It inhibits signal transduction by the B-cell
receptor and its coreceptor CD19. Recent reports indicate that most human lung cancer cells and cell lines
express CD22, making it an important new therapeutic target for lung cancer. The objective of our studies was to
independently validate these results with the goal of testing the efﬁcacy of our CD22 immunotoxins on lung cancer
cell lines. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we found that levels of CD22 mRNA in a panel of
human lung cancer cell lines were 200 to 60,000-fold lower than those observed in the human CD22þ Burkitt
lymphoma cells, Daudi. Using ﬂow cytometry with a panel of CD22 monoclonal antibodies and Western blot
analyses, we could not detect surface or intracellular expression of CD22 protein in a panel of lung cancer cell
lines. In addition, the in vitro proliferation of the lung tumor cell lines was not affected by either CD22 antibodies
or our highly potent anti-CD22 immunotoxin. In contrast, CD22þ Daudi cells expressed high levels of CD22 mRNA
and protein, and were sensitive to our CD22 immunotoxin. Importantly, primary non–small cell lung cancers from
more than 250 patient specimens did not express detectable levels of CD22 protein as assessed by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that CD22 is not expressed at measurable levels on the surface of lung cancer cells,
and that these cells cannot be killed by anti-CD22 immunotoxins. Cancer Res; 74(1); 263–71. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide
(1). There are two major types of lung cancer: non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Surgical resection remains the main treatment strategy for
the former, and chemotherapy for the latter (2–4). A major goal
in this ﬁeld is to identify novel targets to treat both types of
tumors. (5). Recently, Tuscano and colleagues (6) reported that
CD22, a hallmark marker on B lymphocytes, is expressed on
lung cancer cells and might serve as a new target for therapy.
CD22 (Siglec-2) is a 140-kDa B–cell-restricted membranebound member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that
binds glycan ligands containing a2,6-linked sialic acid

(a2,6Sia) through its two amino-terminal of seven extracellular Ig-like domains (7–9). CD22 inhibits B-cell antigen
receptor (BCR) and CD19 signaling, as well as B-cell survival,
through mechanisms that are both dependent upon, and
independent of, its ligand-binding activity (10). CD22 has a
cytoplasmic domain with six conserved tyrosines, four of
which are present within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibitory motifs. Following cross-linking of BCRs, these
tyrosine residues are phosphorylated, allowing the recruitment of Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain-containing
protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and SH2 domaincontaining inositol 50 -phosphatase (SHIP), the subsequent
dephosphorylation of BCR-proximal signaling molecules, and
the inhibition of BCR signaling (11–13).
Because of its restriction to the B-cell lineage and its rapid
internalization following antibody-mediated cross-linking,
CD22 is an attractive therapeutic target for treating B-cell
malignancies and autoimmune diseases involving dysregulated B cells (14–22).
If, indeed, lung cancer cells do express CD22, the agents that
target CD22 might be effective in patients with lung cancer.
Over the last two decades, we and others have tested monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and immunoconjugates directed
against CD22 in mouse xenograft models of human B-cell
lymphomas and leukemias (14–22). In phase 1 and 2 clinical
trials in humans, side effects have been tolerable and efﬁcacy
has been encouraging (23–28). Several CD22-based therapies
are now moving into advanced clinical trials (23–28). Because
the observations of Tuscano and colleagues (6) were encouraging, and as we have developed therapeutics targeting CD22þ

cells, we designed studies to determine whether our CD22
immunotoxins would kill lung cancer cell lines. Before doing
so, we repeated the experiments reported by Tuscano and
colleagues (6) to conﬁrm that lung cancer cell lines were
indeed CD22þ. Using the same methods, cell lines, and antibodies, as well as an additional panel of more than 30 antiCD22 mAbs and several cell lines, we failed to conﬁrm that
surface CD22 is expressed at measurable levels on lung cancer
cell lines and sections of lung tumors, or that CD22-targeted
immunotoxin kills lung cancer cells including those reported
to be CD22þ by Tuscano and colleagues (6).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The human Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Daudi (29), the acute
T-cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat, (30), and the NSCLCs cell lines,
Calu-1 (31) and A549 (32), were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Other NSCLC cell lines (H358,
H460, HCC827, H1299, H1355, H1650, and H1975) and two
SCLC cell lines (H727 and H1184) were obtained from Drs.
Minna and Gazdar at UT Southwestern (UTSW) who originally
established them (33,34). All cell lines were veriﬁed by DNA
ﬁngerprinting with the Promega StemElite ID system (Promega), which consists of nine short tandem repeat markers,
one gender-speciﬁc marker (amelogenin), and one mousespeciﬁc locus. These loci collectively provide a genetic proﬁle
with a random match probability of 1 in 3  109. Fingerprints
were compared with the database of Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research (HCTOR) at UTSW of more than
500 reference ﬁngerprints collected from the ATCC and the
HCTOR (34). A match was deﬁned as two ﬁngerprints where at
least seven of 10 human markers were identical. This allows for
cell-culture drift or genomic instability in some cancer cell
lines. In addition, all cell lines were conﬁrmed to be free of
mycoplasma using the Mycoplasma Tissue Culture-NI kit
(Gen-Probe). Cell suspensions of Daudi and Jurkat cells, and
monolayers of all the adherent lung cancer cell lines were
maintained in RPMI1640 (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone and Atlanta Biologicals), penicillin (100 U/
mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL; Gibco and Mediatech), and Lglutamine (2 mmol/L, Gibco and Mediatech). For passaging, all
adherent cells were harvested following treatment with 0.25%
trypsin–EDTA solution (Gibco and Sigma) and subcultured at
1:4 to 1:6 split ratios when 80% to 90% conﬂuence was achieved.
Alternatively, adherent cells were harvested using CellStripper
(Mediatech). All cell lines were maintained at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed chamber of 95% air and 5% CO2. A cryopreserved
aliquot of each cell line was thawed every 4 to 5 weeks.
Cell staining and ﬂow cytometry
Tumor cells were analyzed for the expression of cellsurface CD22 by immunoﬂuorescence staining followed by
ﬂow cytometric analysis in three different laboratories by
ﬁve independent investigators. For each staining, samples of
1  106 cells were suspended in 100 mL of staining buffer [2%
BSA (Sigma) in PBS] containing a range of concentrations
(0.005–5 mg/sample) of primary antibodies (mouse anti-human

CD22 mAbs and their corresponding isotype-matched control
mAbs for 30 minutes at 4 C in the dark). After washing, a
secondary R-phycoerthrin (RPE)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG
(heavy and light chains) antibody adsorbed with human IgG
(Southern Biotech Equipment) was added to the cells for
30 minutes at 4 C in the dark. In some experiments, a ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was
used to detect primary antibody (19). Data were obtained
using a FACSCalibur (Beckton Dickinson) and analyzed using
FlowJo 8.5 Software (Tree Star Inc., Stanford, CA). In total, 34
mouse anti-human CD22 mAbs that bind different domains
of the CD22 molecule were used, and they originated as
follows: HD6, RFB4, UV22-1, and UV22-2 were characterized
initially by Shen and colleagues (17) and Li and colleagues (35);
HB22-2, HB22-5, HB22-7, HB22-12, HB22-13, HB22-15, HB2217, HB22-18, HB22-19, HBB22-22, HB22-23, HB22-25, HB22-26,
HB22-27, HB22-33, and HB22-196 as described previously
(36,37); 3G5, 3H4, 4KB128, BC-8, BL-3C4, BU59, EC6 (OKB22A),
G28-7, HD39, HD239, HI22, IS7, S-HCL1 (Leu-14), and To15,
were obtained from the Fifth International Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen Workshop (Boston, MA; refs. 36,37). Their
isotypes and speciﬁc CD22 binding domains are summarized
in Supplementary Table S1. The mouse isotype IgG control
antibodies included the IgG1s, MOPC-21 (38), and MOPC-31C
(39, 40), the IgG2a (G155-178; BD Biosciences; unpublished
data) and the IgG2b (MPC-11; refs. 41,42) were purchased from
BD Biosciences. All three mouse IgG isotypes were used as
negative controls for HB22-33 (IgM) mAb staining.
Western blotting
Ten million cells were lysed for 30 minutes on ice in the Cell
Extraction Buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) and a protease inhibitor
cocktail (both from Sigma) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The protein concentration of the lysates was
determined using a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Equal amounts of total protein
(25 mg) were electrophoresed on 8% SDS–PAGE, and the
proteins were electrotransferred from the gel to an ImmunBlot polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PDVF) membrane (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). After blocking with 5% BSA (Sigma) in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) for 1 hour at
room temperature with shaking, the membranes were incubated with the speciﬁc primary antibodies overnight at 4 C,
washed, and probed for 1 hour with speciﬁc horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-linked goat anti-rabbit Ig (heavy and light
chains) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of
1:3,000 at room temperature with shaking. The bands were
visualized with Pierce Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL)
Western Blotting substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and scanned
using the ScanMaker 4900 (Microtek International Inc.). As
primary antibodies, polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD22 (H221; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200 and rabbit
anti-human b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of
1:1,000 were used. H-221 was the same anti-CD22 antibody
used by Tuscano and colleagues, and was purchased from the
same company. Each assay was performed by two independent
investigators.

Reevaluation of CD22 Expression in Human Lung Cancer

Quantiﬁcation of CD22 transcripts
Two methods were used for quantiﬁcation:
(1) For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), mRNA from
1 to 5  106 cells was extracted using QIAcube (Qiagen).
cDNA was generated from 0.5 mg mRNA using an iScript
cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). Gene-speciﬁc TaqMan
probes (Applied Biosystems) were utilized for
quantitative analyses of mRNA transcript levels (CD22
Hs00233533_m1, GAPDH 02758991_g1). The GAPDH
gene was employed as an internal reference to normalize
input cDNA. PCR reactions utilized the ABI 7300 Realtime PCR System and Software (Applied Biosystems).
The comparative CT method was used to calculate
relative mRNA concentrations.
(2) For PCR mapping of CD22 transcripts, total RNA from
5 to 10  106 cells was extracted using TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed
(Applied Biosystems) before performing cDNA synthesis
from 1 mg of total RNA (SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis System; Invitrogen). The primer sequences
amplifying three distinct regions of human CD22 were:
leader sequence (LS) to the Ig domain I (Ig I): (Forward)
50 -GGGAAGACACGCGGAAACAGG-30 and (reverse) 50 GAGGTGCACCGGGTGGATACTC-30 ; Ig domain II (Ig II)
to Ig domain III (Ig III): (Forward) 50 GAGGCAGGCTGCTGTCACCTCG-30 and (Reverse) 50 CCACGTCATTGGAGACCTGACAGCAGTACTTCC-30 ;
Ig domain IV (Ig IV) to cytoplasmic domain (Cyto):
(Forward) 50 -GGTCAGCCTCCAATGTGACT-30 and
(Reverse) 50 -CTGGCTCTGTGTCCTCTTCC-30 . GAPDH
transcripts were ampliﬁed as a reference: (Forward) 50 TCACCAGGGCTGCTTTTA-30 and (Reverse) 50 TTCACACCCATGACGAACA-30 . PCR cycle times: 95 C
for 30 seconds, 60 C for 45 seconds, and 72 C for 45
seconds (30 or 40 cycles).

Cytotoxicity assays
Anti-CD22 mAbs were tested for their ability to kill human
lung cancer cell lines versus the CD22þ Daudi and CD22
Jurkat cell lines. A total of 2  104 cells in 100 mL complete RPMI
medium were incubated in quadruplicate in 96-well plates at
37 C for 16 hours. Mouse anti-human CD22 mAbs (HB22-7 or
RFB4) and chimeric anti-human CD20 mAb, Rituximab (Biogen Idec, Inc.), were added in a ﬁnal volume of 200 mL at
concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mg/mL (3.33–33.3  108
mol/L). Two mAbs coupled to deglycosylated ricin A chain
(dgA) immunotoxins were used as positive (RFB4-dgA; refs. 16–
19) and negative RFT5-dgA (43) controls. Both immunotoxins
were added in a ﬁnal volume of 200 mL at ﬁnal concentrations
ranging from 1  1010 to 1  1013 mol/L. Another nonspeciﬁc positive control, Triton X-100 (Sigma) at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.675% in a ﬁnal volume of 200 mL, was also used.
Cells were incubated at 37 C for another 72 hours. Twenty
microliter of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (MTS; Promega)
was then added to each well, and the plates were incubated for

www.aacrjournals.org

another 3 hours. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a
Tecan Spectraﬂuor Plus plate reader and analyzed with Magellan 2 software (both from Tecan). The experiments were
repeated at least 3 times by two independent investigators.
In addition, cytotoxicity was measured by plating lung
cancer cell lines (1  104 cells/mL) in triplicate wells of 48well tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Sigma) containing 10% FBS, and allowing them to
adhere for 8 hours. Each group of triplicate wells was then
treated with 50 mg/mL HB22-7, 50 mg/mL Rituximab (negative
control), or medium only. After 72 hours, the nonadherent cells
were harvested and combined with the remaining adherent
cells that were harvested using trypsin–EDTA. The cells were
washed in Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS; Mediatech), and then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (FACScan; Becton Dickinson) for
the percentage of viable cells using 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7-AAD) at a 1:500 dilution for staining (BD Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) samples from
surgically resected lung cancer specimens were obtained from
the Tissue Procurement Resource at UTSW and the Lung
Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence Tissue
Bank at The University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDA)
Cancer Center (Houston, Texas). Detailed information regarding the pathologic diagnosis and staging, demographic data
(gender and race), smoking history, treatment, overall survival,
and time of recurrence for the majority of the clinical cases
were obtained, and are presented in Supplementary Tables S2
to S4. The tissue procurement and distribution were approved
by the Institutional Review Board of both universities.
Parafﬁn-embedded sections from 10 lung cancer specimens
(ﬁve squamous cell carcinomas and ﬁve adenocarcinomas;
Supplementary Table S2) were sectioned at 5 mm and afﬁxed
to silane-coated microscope slides. Serial sections were deparafﬁnized, hydrated, and subjected to antigen-unmasking
techniques speciﬁc to each marker: for CD22, heating for 10
minutes at 95 C in 1 mmol/L EDTA at pH 8.0; for thyroid
transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), heating for 10 minutes at 95 C
in 1 Antigen Retrieval Citrate at pH 6.0 (BioGenex Laboratories); and for pan-cytokeratin, incubation for 15 minutes at room
temperature with 0.1% Pronase E (Sigma). Following antigenretrieval, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by adding
0.5% H2O2 (Sigma) followed by 3% normal horse serum (Vector).
Primary mouse anti-human mAbs against CD22 (FPC1; dilution
1:30), pan-cytokeratin 5/6/18 (LP34; dilution 1:30), or TTF-1
(SPT24; dilution 1:50), from Leica Biosystems, were diluted in
PBS applied to sections, and incubated overnight at 4 C. Subsequent biotin/streptavidin HRP detection of bound primary
mAb was conducted according to a previously described immunoperoxidase method using reagents from Vector (44,45) and
3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen (Dako). Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and cover slips were afﬁxed with permanent mounting medium. Brightﬁeld photomicrography of resulting stains was performed on a
Leica DM2000 compound microscope, equipped with an Optronics Microﬁre CCD Camera. Images were acquired with Pictureframe v.2.0 software and saved as TIFF ﬁles.

Alternatively, tumor tissues specimens from 217 NSCLCs
(Supplementary Table S3) were used to build a tissue microarray (TMA) using triplicates of 1.5-mm cores from each
sample. In addition, 20 whole-section specimen slides (10
squamous cell carcinomas and 10 adenocarcinomas) from
NSCLC surgical resections were examined (Supplementary
Table S4). Tonsil tissue, which is rich in B-cell lymphocytes,
was used as a positive control for CD22 immunostaining.
Moreover, the B cells were present in some of the tumor tissue
specimens and were used as an "internal" CD22-positive control. For a negative control, PBS instead of primary antibody
was added. For these immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments, heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed in a
pressure cooker using pH 6.0 Target Retrieval Solution (Dako).
The IHC staining was performed in an Autostainer Plus
automated immunostaining machine (Dako), using the mouse
anti-human CD22 mAb (Leica Biosystems) at a 1:20 dilution as
primary antibody, incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, and as secondary system for detection a Dako EnVision
þ Dual Link System-HRP (DABþ; Dako) was used according to
the manufacturer's recommendations.

Results
Some lung cancer cell lines express very low levels of
CD22 transcripts
We ﬁrst analyzed CD22 mRNA expression in the lung
cancer cell lines. Using a CD22 gene- speciﬁc TaqMan
probe for quantitative analysis by qRT-PCR, we found that
the levels of CD22 mRNA were 200- to 60,000-fold lower
than those observed in Daudi cells (Table 1). To validate these
data, we used PCR primers that amplify three distinct regions
of human CD22 transcripts and span introns to avoid DNA
ampliﬁcation. After 30 cycles of ampliﬁcation, we observed
weak corresponding-sized bands only for HCC827, H727,
H1650, and H1975 cells relative to Daudi cells. Appropriately-sized bands were readily visualized after 40 cycles of
ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the PCR ampliﬁcation
product from H727 cell cDNA generated using Ig IV to
Cyto primers was sequenced using both forward and reverse
primers. The PCR product was a perfect match for the human
CD22 cDNA sequence. Thus, H727 cells expressed CD22
transcripts at levels that were 0.5% of those observed in
Daudi cells.
Lung cancer cell lines do not express measurable levels of
cell surface CD22
The indirect cellular staining performed with ﬁve CD22
mAbs (HB22-7, HD6, RFB4, UV22-1, and UV22-2; refs. 17,35)
versus their corresponding isotype-matched controls at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 50 mg/mL revealed no measurable CD22 expression on any of the lung cancer cell lines. As
expected, and shown previously (16), Daudi cells expressed
high levels of cell surface CD22 (Fig. 2A).
Based on these earlier qRT-PTCR data, where we found that
the H727 cells line expressed the highest levels of CD22
transcripts, we examined a comprehensive panel of mouse
anti-human CD22 mAbs for binding to the H727 cell line, as
well as Daudi (positive control) and Jurkat (negative control)

Figure 2. Cell-surface CD22 can be detected on CD22 Daudi cells but not on human lung cancer cell lines. A, ﬂow cytometric analysis. One million cells from
each cell line were incubated with 25 mg/mL of either a mouse isotype control antibody (MPC-11) or mouse anti-human CD22 (clone HB22.7) mAb. After
washing out the unbound primary antibody, an FITC-labeled secondary goat anti-human IgG antibody was used. Cells were analyzed in FL-1 using a BD
FACSCalibur. Red line, cells without antibodies; green line, cells plus the isotype control antibody and secondary antibody; and blue line, cells plus
the anti-CD22 antibody and secondary antibody. This is one representative out of four to six independent experiments. B, Western blotting analysis. Equal
amounts (25 mg) of protein from cell lysates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by a Western blotting with a rabbit anti-human CD22 antibody
(H-221 clone). Top, CD22 expression; bottom, b-actin expression (loading control): 1, Daudi; 2, no loading; 3, Calu-1; 4, H1975; 5, H1650; 6, H1355; 7, H1299;

to four independent experiments.

CD22 protein expression in lung cancer cell lines cannot
be detected by Western blotting
To validate the ﬂow cytometry data, we carried out Western
blotting for CD22 using cell lysates and a polyclonal antiserum
reactive with CD22. As expected, the lysates prepared from
Daudi cells showed a very strong band corresponding to 130 to
140 kDa (the molecular weight of the human CD22 molecule). In
contrast, no bands corresponding to the molecular weight of
CD22 were observed in the lysates of the lung cancer cells or the
negative control, Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). Based on these experiments, we concluded that only Daudi cells express the CD22
protein at detectable levels when 25 mg of loaded protein were
examined.
CD22 mAbs and a potent anti-CD22 immunotoxin are not
cytotoxic for lung cancer cell lines
Because it had been previously claimed that CD22 mAb alone
killed lung cancer cell lines in vitro (6), we repeated the published
experiments using a range of concentrations of ﬁve anti-CD22
mAbs (HB22-7, HD6, RFB4, UV22-1, and UV22-2) versus their
corresponding isotype mAb controls. In addition, we included

www.aacrjournals.org

our highly potent CD22-speciﬁc immunotoxin, RFB4-dgA, versus
the corresponding isotype-control immunotoxin, RFT5 (antiCD25)-dgA. These treatments had no effect on the viability of
the lung tumor cell lines in vitro as measured by the Cell Titer 96
AQueous One Solution assay, which measures the functionality of
the mitochondrial membrane (a critical parameter of cellular
physiology). As expected, only the CD22 immunotoxin (but not
the isotype-matched immunotoxin) was highly effective in killing
Daudi cells in vitro (<10% viability at a molar concentration of 1
 1011; Fig. 3). In addition, we used the chemical 7-AAD, which
binds speciﬁcally to nuclear DNA following disruption of the
cellular membrane, to measure the potential cytotoxic effect of
naked CD22 mAb. No differences between the viability of cells
treated with HB22-7 versus untreated cells were observed using
7-AAD staining in any of the cell lines, including lung cancer lines
and Daudi B cell lymphoma cells (data not shown).

colleagues. We ﬁrst analyzed 10 FFPE lung cancer specimens
from patients (5 squamous cell carcinomas and 5 adenocarcinomas) for cytokeratin 5/6/18 and TTF-1, to reconﬁrm their
tissue type. Then, from each FFPE sample, serial sections were
investigated for the corresponding expression of cytokeratin
5/6/18 or TTF-1 expression and CD22. Lung cancer cells
stained positively for either cytokeratin 5/6/18 (squamous
cell carcinoma) or TTF-1 (adenocarcinoma), and the intratumoral B cells stained positively for CD22 (Fig. 4).
In addition, we analyzed CD22 expression in a TMA from our
Lung Cancer SPORE (UTMDA Cancer Center) Pathology Core
dataset containing 217 clinically and molecularly annotated
NSCLCs (202 evaluable samples, including138 squamous cell
carcinomas and 64 adenocarcinomas), as well as 20 wholesection specimens (10 squamous cell carcinomas and 10 adenocarcinomas) from NSCLC surgical resections. We observed
CD22 expression only on intratumoral B lymphocytes but not
on the malignant lung cells (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).

Discussion
Tuscano and colleagues have reported that CD22 is
expressed on human lung tumors (6). Although CD22 has been
previously described to be restricted to B cells (7–10, 13), if,
indeed, it is also expressed on lung cancers, this would be
enormously important because it would provide a target for
many already-developed CD22-speciﬁc targeted therapies (14–
22). Thus, the aim of the present study was to further investigate the presence of CD22 on human lung cancer cell lines
and lung tumors with the goal of testing our CD22 immunotoxins (16–19) on lung cancer cell lines in vitro. Using the same
cell lines, antibodies, and assays previously reported by Tus-

268

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

cano and colleagues (6), we have been unable to reproduce
most of their published ﬁndings. Puzzled by this, we validated
our cell lines and also demonstrated that they did not contain
mycoplasma. Alternative methods were also used to identify
CD22 transcripts and proteins in and on the cell lines. All the
experiments (except Western blotting and IHC) reported here
were carried out at least 3 times by three independent investigators at three universities. In addition, we tested a large
panel of more than 30 mouse anti-human CD22 mAbs, four
additional lung cancer cell lines, and more than 250 tissue
sections from lung tumors, and were still unable to identify
cell-surface CD22 expression in lung cancer.
In essence, we found that: (i) some of the lung cancer cell lines
expressed low levels of CD22 mRNA transcripts, but these transcripts represented 1% or less of those found in a B lymphoma cell
line (Daudi); (ii) the lung cancer cell lines did not express CD22
on their surface or internally as determined by ﬂow cytometry or
by Western blotting; (iii) using IHC, lung cancer specimens from
more than 250 patients were found to be CD22 negative; (iv)
CD22-targeted "naked" mAbs or our anti-CD22 immunotoxin
(14–18) had no effect on the viability of the lung cancer cell lines
or a T cell line but effectively killed CD22þ Daudi cells.
Because we were able to ﬁnd very low levels of mRNA
transcripts in the lung cancer cell lines, we determined whether
CD22 expression might be inﬂuenced by the promoters of the
neighboring genes in lung cancer lines. To this end, we
investigated genes localized adjacent to the CD22 locus within
q13.1 of chromosome 19. The nearest ﬂanking neighbor genes
of CD22 are myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) at 50 (46)
and free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3) at 30 (47). Furthermore,
MAG has been described as a protein with many structural

similarities to CD22 (48). However, we were unable to detect
either MAG or FFAR3 protein in the lung cancer cell lines by
Western blotting (data not shown).
The possibility that truncated CD22 proteins might be
expressed on these lung cancer cell lines was tested by using
a panel of more than 30 mouse anti-human CD22 mAbs, which
recognize and bind to all seven different extracellular domain
(s) of CD22 molecules (36, 37). None of the mAbs bound to the
lung cancer cell lines at measurable levels as observed by ﬂow
cytometric analysis. Furthermore, the H727 cell line expressed
CD22 transcripts that included both the extracellular plus
transmembrane regions of CD22.
IHC on lung cancer samples was performed in three consecutive stages: (i) the validation of the speciﬁcity of the
primary mAbs versus control on normal corresponding tissues;
(ii) the reconﬁrmation of the initial postsurgical histopathologic diagnosis of lung cancer and B-cell lymphoma samples;
and (iii) evaluation of CD22 expression on lung cancer cell
lines. We found that all the human lung cancer specimens from
patients were completely CD22 negative. The only CD22-positive signal in these specimens was provided by the inﬁltrating
intratumoral B lymphocytes.
With regard to the report that Tuscano and colleagues (6)
could kill lung cancer cell in vitro with anti-CD22 mAbs, we also
investigated the toxicity of the CD22 mAbs and immunotoxins
using ﬂuorescent 7-AAD, which binds to the intracellular DNA
only if the cell membranes are permeable (e.g., damaged;
ref. 49). Because some drugs might affect the cell viability
without disrupting membrane integrity, we used a second
proliferation assay where the read-out was the quantiﬁcation
of formazan produced by the bioreduction of MTS tetrazolium
compound in mitochondria (50). Both methods showed that

www.aacrjournals.org

neither CD22 mAb nor its immunotoxin had any effect on the
viability of the lung cancer cell lines in culture. In contrast, the
same CD22 immunotoxin effectively killed CD22þ Daudi cells.
In comparing our results to those of Tuscano and colleagues
(6), differences cannot be explained by the use of different
antibodies, cell lines, or methods. Indeed, we extended their
studies to a large panel of CD22 mAbs and an immunotoxin. In
addition, we used many more cell lines and tissue sections, and
great care was taken in our studies to avoid problems (including the use of mAb isotype controls, careful Western blotting
protein loading, and the use of mycoplasma-free tumor lines
that were DNA ﬁngerprinted). We cannot explain the fact that
CD22 mAbs in their studies killed cells, although it is possible
that their antibodies contained low levels of sodium azide or
other toxic chemicals.
Although it has been shown that tumor cells can express
molecules not found on the corresponding normal tissue, in
deﬁning any new or unusual markers on cells, it is essential to
carefully control all the experiments. We hope that other
laboratories will carry out further studies to conﬁrm our results
or those of Tuscano and colleagues before coming to any ﬁnal
conclusions to use CD22-based reagents as diagnostics or
therapeutics for lung cancer.
