BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab and sunitinib are standard initial therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
Despite common use, the safety and activity of sorafenib in bevacizumab- or sunitinib-refractory mRCC have not
been prospectively investigated. METHODS: Metastatic RCC patients with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST)-defined disease progression (PD) after treatment with either bevacizumab or sunitinib received
twice daily 400 mg of sorafenib in a multicenter, prospective phase 2 study. Dose escalation was permitted in the absence of significant toxicity. The primary endpoint was tumor burden reduction rate, defined as the proportion of
patients with 5% reduction in the sum of RECIST-defined target lesions without other PD. Secondary endpoints
included progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival, and safety. A 2-stage accrual
design was used to test the alternative hypothesis that the tumor burden reduction rate was >20% versus <5%.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. The tumor burden reduction rate was 30% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 17%-45%). One unconfirmed objective partial response was observed. The median PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI,
3.6-5.9). There was no association of PFS and tumor shrinkage with response to prior therapy. Most treatment-related
adverse events were of mild-to-moderate intensity, and included fatigue, hypertension, diarrhea, and palmoplantar
erythrodysesthesia (PPE). Patients previously treated with bevacizumab tended to develop more PPE (P ¼ .03)
and mucositis (P ¼ .06), whereas sunitinib-treated patients tended to develop more skin rash (P ¼ .06).
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of sorafenib is safe and feasible in patients with mRCC refractory to either bevacizumab or sunitinib. Modest clinical activity was observed supporting current practice patterns of sequential vascular

KEYWORDS: bevacizumab, metastatic renal cell carcinoma refractory, sorafenib, sunitinib.

Recent advances in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), have established the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer, New York, NY), pazopanib (Votrient, GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, Pa), and bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif) plus interferon as
standard initial treatment options.1-4 For mRCC patients who develop progressive disease (PD) or drug intolerance after
front-line therapy with either sunitinib or sorafenib, everolimus (Affinitor, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hannover,
NJ), an oral mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is currently an accepted standard of care in this setting.5
Other retrospective series have also demonstrated antitumor activity when VEGF-targeted agents are used in a sequential
manner.6-8 These data, albeit limited by their sample size, retrospective nature, and inherent bias, serve as a proof-of-concept that sequential VEGF-targeted therapy is a feasible and safe approach that can also lead to meaningful antitumor
responses in mRCC patients exposed to prior VEGF-targeted therapy.

Sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, West
Haven, Conn and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Emeryville,
Calif) is an orally bioavailable bi-aryl urea Raf kinase capable of inhibiting VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3
and platelet-derived growth factor receptor B,9 with demonstrated clinical activity in advanced RCC, most notably
in cytokine-refractory patients.10-12 As initial treatment
with cytokines has become significantly less common in
mRCC, and in light of data failing to demonstrate a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of sorafenib over interferon in the front-line setting,12 sorafenib is often used in
the second-line setting after prior VEGF-targeted treatment. This practice algorithm is common, although it has
not been prospectively investigated. With the availability
of multiple new and active compounds in RCC, prospective investigation of sequential therapy is crucial to define
the antitumor activity in patients with advanced disease.
Thus, a prospective phase 2 study of sorafenib in patients
with bevacizumab- or sunitinib-refractory mRCC was
undertaken.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility criteria included histologically documented
mRCC with predominant clear cell histology, prior nephrectomy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1, measurable disease,
and evidence of PD after treatment with either sunitinib
or bevacizumab as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.13 Patients treated
with sunitinib must have received at least 1 cycle (4 weeks)
of treatment and have RECIST-defined objective progression during or within 4 months of completing sunitinib
treatment. Similarly, patients treated with bevacizumab
must have received at least 2 doses of bevacizumab and
have RECIST-defined objective progression during or
within 4 months of completing bevacizumab treatment.
Adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function was
required as defined by a serum creatinine 2.0  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin 1.5
 ULN, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 2.5  ULN , leukocytes 3000/lL, absolute
neutrophil count 1500/ lL, and platelets 75,000/lL.
Patients with previously treated central nervous system
(CNS) metastases were eligible, provided they had no evidence of CNS disease progression on imaging performed
at least 2 weeks after definitive treatment of their CNS disease. There were no restrictions regarding the number of
previous systemic treatments received. Exclusion criteria

5384

included prior systemic treatment with sorafenib and significant cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart
failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV),
active angina pectoris requiring nitrate therapy, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or a recent cardiovascular event
(defined as any of the following within the previous 6
months: transient ischemic attack/cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, vascular surgery).
The Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board
reviewed and approved this study in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference
on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All
patients provided written informed consent before
registration.
Baseline evaluations included medical history and
physical examination, laboratory parameters (hematology
and blood chemistry), and tumor imaging (computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging
[MRI] of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; bone scan; and
brain CT or MRI scan). In addition, patients self-measured blood pressure daily throughout the study and notified their physician if systolic blood pressure was >150
mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure was >90 mm Hg.
Patients received sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice
daily, continuously in repeated 4-week cycles. Treatment
was continued until RECIST-defined disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Sorafenib
dose reduction to 400 mg daily and then to 400 mg every
other day was allowed on an individual basis depending
on tolerability. Sorafenib dose escalation to either 600 or
800 mg twice daily was also permitted within the study.
Dose escalations were implemented at any time after the
8-week disease reassessment at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients experiencing any grade 4 toxicity
were not allowed to dose escalate.
The primary endpoint was the percentage of tumor
burden reduction rate defined as the proportion of
patients with 5% reduction in the sum of the RECISTdefined target lesions without other progression defined
by RECIST. This endpoint was chosen in light of the low
objective response rate of sorafenib, the unknown PFS of
sorafenib in this setting, and the understanding that tumor burden reduction not meeting criteria for a RECISTdefined objective response can be used to gauge the antitumor activity of targeted therapy in mRCC.
Tumor assessments were performed according to
RECIST criteria at baseline, then every 8 weeks or earlier
if tumor progression was clinically suspected. Secondary
endpoints included PFS, duration of response, overall

survival (OS), and safety. Adverse events (AEs) were
reported and graded according to Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint of this study was the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with mRCC who have progressed after
treatment with bevacizumab or sunitinib. The efficacy of
sorafenib was defined as the proportion of patients who
experience at least a 5% reduction in tumor burden as
measured by RECIST criteria (ie, tumor burden reduction rate). Secondary endpoints included safety, duration
of response, time to progression, and OS. We anticipated
that the effect of sorafenib could be different in these 2
populations; therefore, 2 separate but parallel studies
using a 2-stage accrual design with a maximum goal of 26
patients were implemented to test the alternative hypothesis within each prior treatment group that the tumor burden reduction rate was >20% versus <5% (a ¼ .13, b ¼
.10).
Time to progression and survival were calculated
from the date of registration on-study to the dates of
documented evidence of progression and death, respectively. Patients who were progression-free (alive) at the
time of analysis were censored. The method of Kaplan
and Meier was used to summarize these secondary
endpoints.
Fisher exact test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and
the log-rank test were used to compare characteristics and
outcome between patients initially treated with bevacizumab and those treated with sunitinib. The Wilcoxon
signed rank test was used to compare the change in tumor
burden seen with sorafenib on the current trial to that
seen with patients’ initial anti-VEGF therapy. All statistical tests of significance were 2-tailed; and all analyses were
performed using SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between March 2006 and April 2008, 49 patients with
mRCC were enrolled (Table 1). Two patients withdrew
consent before initiating treatment, and thus were
excluded from all analyses. Twenty patients had received
prior treatment with bevacizumab, and 26 patients had
received prior sunitinib. One additional patient had
received both agents (bevacizumab followed by sunitinib)
and was enrolled on the sunitinib cohort, as this was the

patient’s most recent treatment. The accrual of the bevacizumab-refractory cohort was stopped at 20 patients
because of slow accrual. Overall, 72% of patients were
men, median age was 64 years, and most patients (51%)
were ECOG performance status 0. The majority of
patients (94%) had undergone a prior nephrectomy. By
using the Cleveland Clinic criteria for previously treated
RCC patients,14 47% of patients were considered to have
a good-risk profile, 20% intermediate-risk, and 33%
poor-risk disease. Lungs and then lymph nodes were the
most prevalent sites of metastases, and 52% of patients
had 3 metastatic sites. There were no statistically significant differences in any of these characteristics between
patients initially treated with bevacizumab and those
treated with sunitinib.
Forty-nine percent (23 of 47) of patients received
prior treatment with therapies other than bevacizumab
and sunitinib (median, 1; range, 1-3). Forty percent of
patients (9 of 20 bevacizumab treated and 10 of 27 sunitinib treated) had received prior cytokine therapy before
receiving subsequent anti-VEGF therapy. Similarly, 13%
of patients (1 of 20 bevacizumab treated and 5 of 27 sunitinib treated) had received other classes of antiangiogenic
agents different from sunitinib and/or bevacizumab.
These agents included volociximab (n ¼ 2), pazopanib (n
¼ 2), thalidomide (n ¼ 1), and MLN518 (n ¼ 1). The
median (range) duration of prior VEGF-targeted therapy
before entering this trial was 8.7 (0.4-32.3) months; for
bevacizumab it was 7.7 (0.5-21.6) months, and for sunitinib it was 13.1 (0.4-32.3) months. In addition, the median (range) time from discontinuation of prior therapy
to trial was 4.3 (2.0-63.7) weeks; for bevacizumab it was
4.0 (2.0-22.1) weeks, and for sunitinib it was 4.3 (2.163.7) weeks. Previous tumor response to bevacizumab or
sunitinib was not available in 21% of patients (4 of 20
bevacizumab and 6 of 27 sunitinib). Among the patients
with previous response data, 22% of patients (8 of 37)
had achieved a RECIST-defined PR during their prior
treatment (3 of 16 bevacizumab and 5 of 21 sunitinib),
and 73% (27 of 37) had stable disease (SD) (11 of 16 bevacizumab and 16 of 21 sunitinib). The median (range)
percentage change in tumor volume with previous VEGFtargeted therapy was 21% (71% to 52%); for bevacizumab it was 17% (71% to 52%), and for sunitinib it was 30% (58% to 27%).

Overall, 62% (28 of 45) of patients required dose
modifications. Half (14 of 28) were dose reductions.
Among these, 5 (18%) patients had subsequent dose reescalation to the original sorafenib dose, and 9 (32%) had
dose escalations to either 600 (n ¼ 7) or 800 mg twice

patients who achieved a 5% tumor burden reduction, 8
patients had received prior sunitinib, and 6 patients had
received prior bevacizumab.
There was no indication that tumor burden reduction with sorafenib was impacted by prior anti-VEGF
therapy. Forty-four percent of the patients previously
treated with bevacizumab had at least some tumor burden
reduction with sorafenib (median, 10%; range, 1%20%), compared with 54% of patients previously treated
with sunitinib (median, 15%; range, 1%-31%) (P ¼ .75
and P ¼ .97, respectively).
Although 43% of our patients experienced at least
some tumor burden reduction while on sorafenib treatment, the relative change in tumor burden seen was superior to the change observed with the initial anti-VEGF
therapy in only 25% of patients (P < .001) (Fig. 2).
The estimated median PFS for the entire cohort was
4.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-5.9)
(Fig. 3). Similar to tumor burden reduction, there was no
indication that PFS was impacted by the type of prior
anti-VEGF therapy. Estimated median PFS for patients

5388

treated with bevacizumab was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.98.9), compared with 4.4 months for patients treated with
sunitinib (95% CI, 2.0-7.8) (P ¼ .69). In addition, no
evidence of an improved tumor burden reduction rate or
PFS was observed in patients who underwent dose escalation in this study.
Twenty-four (51%) patients had died, and the estimated median OS was 16.0 months (95% CI, 7.6-32.3).

Adverse Events
The most commonly reported treatment-related all grade
AEs were fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, mucositis,
and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) (Table 3).
Most of these events were of mild or moderate intensity
(grade 1 or 2). The most commonly reported treatmentrelated grade 3 AEs were PPE (31%), fatigue (18%), diarrhea (9%), and hypertension (9%). The most common
laboratory abnormalities observed included anemia,
observed in 13% of patients, hypothyroidism was
observed in 9%, and 1 patient each reported of grade 1 to

Although not statistically significant, patients who
experienced grade 3 toxicity with prior bevacizumab or
sunitinib were more likely to experience grade 3 toxicity
with subsequent sorafenib (P ¼ .23). Notably, there was
significantly more PPE (P ¼ .03) and mucositis (P ¼ .03)
in patients who had received prior bevacizumab, and
more skin rash (P ¼ .06) in patients who had received
prior sunitinib. There were 2 deaths in the study; both
patients received 400 mg orally twice daily, and their
deaths were thought to be secondary to PD.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that sorafenib has modest clinical
activity in sunitinib- or bevacizumab-refractory advanced
RCC patients, and supports current clinical practice patterns of sequential VEGF inhibition. Despite of the lack
of RECIST-defined objective responses observed, our
study did meet its primary endpoint, with a significant
number of patients achieving 5% of tumor burden
reduction, indicating persistent RCC tumor reliance on
VEGF signaling after exposure to either VEGF-binding
or other VEGFR inhibitors.
Administration of second-line sorafenib after either
sunitinib or bevacizumab was relatively safe, and the toxicity profile observed in this study is similar to that previously reported in patients with cytokine-refractory
mRCC,11 but notable for an increase in the number of
patients who discontinued therapy secondary to AEs

(15%) and the incidence of any grade of hypertension
(36%). Di Lorenzo et al15 recently reported a similar prospective experience in 52 sunitinib-refractory patients.
The overall response rate of second-line sorafenib in their
series was 9.6%, and the most common AEs of secondline sorafenib were similar to those observed in our study.
In our study, a significant correlation between previous
bevacizumab treatment with an increased incidence of
mucositis and PPE on subsequent sorafenib was seen.
Likewise, a correlation between previous treatment with
sunitinib and an increased incidence of skin rash was
noted. Despite the small sample size, these observations
raise the concern that prior bevacizumab or sunitinib exposure may influence the AE profile of sorafenib in this
clinical setting.
These data add to the growing prospective data
regarding the clinical effect of sequential therapy in
mRCC. Two contemporary, prospective, multi-institutional studies have demonstrated antitumor activity when
sunitinib or axitinib (AG-013736; Pfizer) are given
sequentially to patients with either bevacizumab- or sorafenib-refractory advanced RCC.16,17 In addition, a phase
3 trial demonstrated an improvement in PFS for everolimus (Affinitor, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) in patients
with sunitinib- and/or sorafenib-refractory advanced
RCC, albeit compared with an inactive control (placebo).5 The objective response rates in these studies
ranged from 1% to 23%, with PFS ranging from approximately 4 months to 7 months. Although the biologic
mechanism responsible for the resistance to initial VEGFtargeted therapy remains unknown, it is clear that sequential therapy with either a VEGF or an mTOR inhibitor
can favorably impact clinical outcome in mRCC.

Furthermore, acknowledging the limitations of comparison across small trials, the most robust antitumor effect
appears to be associated with the potency of VEGFR inhibition. Existing data supporting sequential therapy in
mRCC also suggest that response or lack thereof to prior
VEGF-targeted therapy does not appear to predict subsequent response.
Additional phase 3 trials that include multiple correlative studies are underway to define the objective
response rate and PFS of sequential approaches with novel
compounds. Such data may gradually help to define an
optimal sequence with further insight into specific
sequences for individual patients.
This study had several limitations. First, this was a
single-agent, nonrandomized study without a control
arm, and as such has limitations in determining the relative benefit of sorafenib as compared with other treatment
strategies in this setting. Similarly, although our study
used RECIST criteria to define previous failure to either
sunitinib or bevacizumab, there are inherent limitations
to RECIST and radiographic assessment with targeted
agents in RCC, and thus it is likely patients were variably
refractory to their prior VEGF-targeted therapy.
In conclusion, sorafenib has modest antitumor activity in patients with bevacizumab- or sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC. Although mechanisms of resistance
to VEGF therapy remain undefined, this prospective
study supports current patterns of clinical practice and
supports the hypothesis of continued reliance of RCC
tumors on VEGF signaling despite previous VEGF-targeted therapy.
