Summary
Progesterone receptor (PR) expression is employed as a biomarker of estrogen receptor-α (ERα)
function and breast cancer prognosis. We now show that PR is not merely an ERα-induced gene
target, but is also an ERα-associated protein that modulates its behaviour. In the presence of
agonist ligands, PR associates with ERα to direct ERα chromatin binding events within breast

cancer cells, resulting in a unique gene expression programme that is associated with good clinical
outcome. Progesterone inhibited estrogen-mediated growth of ERα+ cell line xenografts and
primary ERα+ breast tumour explants and had increased anti-proliferative effects when coupled
with an ERα antagonist. Copy number loss of PgR is a common feature in ERα+ breast cancers,
explaining lower PR levels in a subset of cases. Our findings indicate that PR functions as a
molecular rheostat to control ERα chromatin binding and transcriptional activity, which has
important implications for prognosis and therapeutic interventions.

There is compelling evidence that inclusion of a progestogen as part of hormone
replacement therapy (HRT) increases risk of breast cancer, implying that PR signalling can
contribute towards tumour formation1. However, the increased risk of breast cancer
associated with progestogen-containing HRT is mainly attributed to specific synthetic
progestins, in particular medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), which is known to also have
androgenic properties2. The relative risk is not significant when native progesterone is
used3. In ERα+ breast cancers, PR is often used as a positive prognostic marker of disease
outcome4, but the functional role of PR signalling remains unclear. While activation of PR
may promote breast cancer in some women and in some model systems, progesterone
treatment has been shown to be antiproliferative in ERα+ PR+ breast cancer cell lines5-7 and
progestogens have been shown to oppose estrogen-stimulated growth of an ERα+ PR+
patient-derived xenograft8. In addition, exogenous expression of PR in ERα+ breast cancer
cells blocks estrogen-mediated proliferation and ERα transcriptional activity9. Furthermore,
in ERα+ breast cancer patients, PR is an independent predictor of response to adjuvant
tamoxifen10, high levels of PR correlate with decreased metastatic events in early stage
disease11 and administration of a progesterone injection prior to surgery can provide
improved clinical benefit12. These observations imply that PR activation in the context of
estrogen-driven, ERα+ breast cancer, can have an anti-tumourigenic effect. In support of
this, PR agonists can exert clinical benefit in ERα+ breast cancer patients that have relapsed
on ERα antagonists13.
Breast cancers are typically assessed for ERα, PR and HER2 expression to define
histological subtype and guide treatment options. PR is an ERα-induced gene14 and ERα+
PR+ HER2- tumours tend to have the best clinical outcome because PR positivity is thought
to reflect a tumour that is driven by an active ERα complex and therefore likely to respond
to endocrine agents such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors10,15. While ERα+ PR+
tumours have a better clinical outcome than ERα+ PR− tumours4, clinical response to ERα
antagonists can vary, even among tumours with similar ERα and PR status15,16 and recent
evidence suggests that PR may be prognostic, but not predictive17. Some ERα+ PR−
tumours that are resistant to one class of ERα antagonists gain clinical benefit from another
class, suggesting that in a subset of ERα+ PR− breast cancers, the lack of PR expression
does not reflect a nonfunctional ERα complex. It has been proposed that the non-functional
ERα complex theory cannot completely explain PR negativity18. An alternative hypothesis
is that other factors contribute to the loss of PR expression, which consequently influences
breast tumour responses to ERα target therapies.

PR is recruited to the ERα complex

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Given the controversial and complex interplay between the ERα and PR pathways in breast
cancer, we explored the possible functional crosstalk between these two transcription factors
and the implications for clinical prognosis in ERα+ disease. Ligand-activated ERα and PR
protein complexes were purified to ascertain interplay between these two transcription
factors. Asynchronous ERα+ PR+ MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cells were grown in
SILAC-labelled growth media, which contains sufficient estrogen to elicit maximal ERα
binding to chromatin19. Estrogen treatment is required to induce detectable levels of PR in
MCF-7 cells but not T-47D cells20. The two cell lines were subsequently treated with
vehicle or one of two progestogens: native progesterone or the synthetic progestin R5020.
Cells were cross-linked following hormone treatment and endogenous PR was
immunopurified followed by mass spectrometry, using a technique we recently developed
called RIME21. Under estrogenic conditions, progesterone treatment significantly induced
an interaction between PR and ERα in the MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines, in support of
previous findings showing a physical interaction between these two nuclear receptors22. In
addition to ERα, progesterone treatment induced interactions between PR and known ERαassociated co-factors, including NRIP1, GATA3 and TLE321 in both cell lines (Figure 1a).
As expected, treatment with natural ligand decreased interaction between PR and
chaperone/co-chaperone proteins such as HSP90 and FKBP4/5 (Figure 1a). The same
findings were observed when R5020 was used as a synthetic ligand (Extended data figure 1).
Interestingly, when ERα was purified under the same treatment conditions, PR was the only
differentially recruited protein in both cell lines (Figure 1b). Moreover, the interaction
between ERα and known ERα-associated co-factors was not differentially affected by
progesterone treatment. A list of all interacting proteins under all experimental conditions is
provided in Supplementary table 1. The progesterone-induced ERα-PR interaction was
confirmed by standard co-IP experiments in both MCF-7 and T-47D cells (Figure 1c). We
conclude that activation of PR results in a robust association between PR and the ERα
complex. However, it remains unclear what impact this may have on ERα/PR DNA binding
or what the primary DNA tethering mechanism may be (Figure 1d).

Progesterone reprograms ERα binding events
Since PR is a transcription factor, we hypothesised that the progestogen-induced interaction
between PR and ERα alters chromatin binding properties of the ERα-co-factor complex.
MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines grown in complete (estrogenic) media were stimulated with
progesterone, R5020 or vehicle control for 3 or 24 hours, followed by analysis of genomewide ERα and PR and the co-activator p300 profiles by ChIP-seq. p300 deposits the
H3K27Ac mark, which is indicative of functional enhancers23. We found comparable ERα,
PR and p300 binding at 3 hours and 24 hours (Extended data figure 1 and data not shown)
and chose 3hr for the remaining experiments. All ChIP-seq experiments were subsequently
repeated in triplicate following 3 hours of treatment (sample clustering is provided in
Extended data figure 2). Whereas robust ERα binding (29,149 sites in MCF-7 cells and
8,438 sites in T-47D cells) was observed in estrogenic conditions, limited PR binding events
were seen under these conditions (Supplementary table 2). Treatment with progesterone or
the synthetic progestin R5020 in estrogen-rich media resulted in robust PR recruitment to

chromatin, with 46,191 PR binding events observed in T-47D cells with both ligands and
29,554 PR binding events in MCF-7 cells. Using DiffBind to identify differential peaks24
that occurred following treatment of cells with progesterone or R5020, a rapid and robust
redistribution of ERα binding to novel genomic loci was observed (Figure 2a and 2b). In
T-47D cells, 14,223 ERα binding events were reproducibly gained following 3 hours of
treatment with progesterone, a finding that was similar following stimulation with R5020,
confirming a predictable redistribution of ERα chromatin binding following stimulation of
the PR pathway. A similar rapid redirection of ERα was observed in MCF-7 cells after
progesterone or R5020 treatment (Extended data figure 1). The ERα sites reprogrammed by
progesterone are likely to be functional, as indicated by the global recruitment of the coactivator p300 (Figure 2b and Extended data figure 2). These ERα binding events appear to
be mediated by PR, since 99% of the gained ERα binding sites in T-47D cells overlapped
with a PR binding event (Figure 2c) (the overlap in MCF-7 cells was 94%) and motif
analysis of the ERα gained sites revealed the presence of progesterone responsive elements
(PREs), but not estrogen responsive elements (EREs) (Figure 2b). This suggests that PR
mediates the interaction between the ERα/PR/p300 complex and DNA. ERα ChIP-seq was
repeated in MCF-7 and T-47D cells following hormone deprivation and subsequent
treatment with vehicle, estrogen alone or progesterone alone. Single hormone treatments did
not induce the ERα binding events observed under dual hormone conditions (Extended data
figure 3), confirming that the ERα reprogramming is dependent on having both receptors
activated simultaneously. In addition, Forkhead motifs were enriched at the ERα gained
sites and 49% of the gained ERα/PR binding events were shown to overlap with FoxA1
binding (Extended data figure 4), consistent with previous findings showing that PR binding
involves the pioneer factor FoxA125. In keeping with the anti-proliferative effects of
progestogens in ERα+ breast cancer cells, analysis of the genes bound by ERα following
progesterone treatment revealed enrichment for cell death, apoptosis and differentiation
pathways (Supplementary table 3).
To identify the transcriptional targets of the progestogen-induced ERα binding events, we
treated estrogen-stimulated MCF-7 and T-47D cells with progesterone, R5020 or vehicle for
3 hours and performed eight replicates of RNA-seq. In total, 470 genes were differentially
regulated by dual treatment with estrogen and progesterone or R5020 compared to estrogen
alone in both T-47D and MCF7 cell lines (Extended data figure 4). GSEA analysis revealed
a pronounced enrichment of progestogen-induced ERα binding events near genes upregulated by progestogen treatment in the presence of estrogen (Figure 2d). Collectively,
these findings suggest that the progestogen-mediated changes in ERα binding events are
functionally significant, since they co-recruit p300 and lead to new gene expression profiles
(Figure 2d and Extended data figure 4). Importantly, increased expression of a gene
signature that results from progesterone-stimulated ERα binding confers good prognosis in a
cohort of 1,959 breast cancer patients (Extended data figure 5).
The relative degree of ERα reprogramming and gene expression changes following
progesterone treatment was higher in T-47D cells compared to MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
table 2), possibly due to the differences in PR levels between these two cell lines20. We
assessed the PR gene (PgR) in these cell lines, which revealed copy number gain of the PgR

gene in T-47D cells and a heterozygous loss of the PgR gene in MCF-7 cells (Extended data
figure 5). Exogenous expression of PR (both isoforms) in the MCF-7 cell line resulted in
growth inhibition (Extended data figure 6), confirming an anti-proliferative role for PR, via
modulation of ERα transcriptional activity9.

Progesterone blocks ERα+ tumour growth

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To explore the hypothesis that progesterone stimulation could have beneficial effects on
ERα+ tumour growth in vivo, we established MCF-7-Luciferase xenografts in NOD/SCID/
IL2Rg-/- (NSG) mice and exposed the mice to control (i.e. no hormone), slow release
estrogen pellets or slow release estrogen plus standard high concentration progesterone
pellets26. Ten tumours for each condition were implanted (two tumours per mouse and five
mice per condition) and tumour formation was monitored using bioluminescent imaging.
After 25 days, in the absence of any hormone, tumours did not grow, but stimulation with
estrogen alone resulted in tumour growth. Co-treatment with estrogen plus progesterone
resulted in a significant decrease in tumour volume, as compared to estrogen alone, when
measured by bioluminescence (Figure 3a and 3b) (p = 0.0021) or tumour volume (p = 0.019)
(Extended data figure 6). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that PR expression was induced
under both estrogen and estrogen plus progesterone conditions (Extended data figure 7), but
importantly, PR will only be active under dual hormone conditions. We repeated the MCF-7
xenograft experiment in ovariectomised mice, in order to eliminate any confounding issues
related to endogenous mouse hormones. Assessment of tumour growth (Extended data
figure 7) confirmed the previous finding (Figure 3b) that progesterone inhibited tumour
formation. We performed ERα and PR ChIP-seq on six randomly selected sets of matched
estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone stimulated xenograft tumours (taken from the final
time point) and identified differentially bound ERα binding events. The major variable
driving clustering of ERα binding events within tumour xenografts was the treatment
condition (Extended data figure 7). As observed in the short-term cell line experiments
(Figure 2), estrogen-stimulated ERα binding in the xenograft tumours was substantially
altered by progesterone treatment. We observed 3,603 differentially regulated ERα binding
events in xenograft tumours from estrogen plus progesterone conditions, when compared to
estrogen-only conditions (Figure 3c). As such, progesterone induced a global
reprogramming of ERα binding events in vivo, even following long-term hormonal
treatment.
To extend our findings into primary tumours, we employed a novel ex vivo primary tumour
culture system27,28 to cultivate ERα+ PR+ primary tumours for short time periods, in order
to study the effect of hormonal treatment on cell growth. Fourteen independent ERα+ PR+
primary tumours were used for the analysis. Each tumour was cut into small pieces and
randomised onto gelatine sponges half-submersed in media to sustain tissue architecture and
viability. Tumour explants were then cultivated under hormone-deprived conditions for 36
hours, followed by a 48 hour treatment with vehicle control, estrogen, the synthetic
progestin R5020 or estrogen plus R5020. Tumours retained normal cellular and
morphological features after treatment in the ex vivo context (Extended data figure 8). Fixed
tissues were stained for Ki67 to assess changes in proliferation. Most of the tumours
responded to estrogen with a coincident increase in the percentage of cells that expressed

Ki67. Co-treatment with progestin significantly inhibited estrogen-stimulated proliferation
(Figure 3d and Extended data figure 8), showing that progesterone can antagonise estrogeninduced growth in primary human breast tumours cultivated as explants. Example images
are shown in Figure 3e. Importantly, the addition of progestin alone did not increase growth
rates (Figure 3d and Extended data figure 8), in support of our hypothesis that progesterone
lacks proliferative potential and importantly, is anti-proliferative in an estrogen-driven
context. ERα and PR co-localisation was confirmed in the explant tumour samples using
immunofluorescence, as was the reduction in Ki67 following progestogen treatment
(Extended data figure 8).
Given our findings that progestogens are anti-proliferative in an estrogen-driven tumour
context, we combined progesterone treatment with a standard of care therapy in xenograft
models. MCF-7 xenografts were implanted in NSG mice and supplemented with slowrelease estrogen pellets. Mice were subsequently treated with vehicle, progesterone alone,
tamoxifen alone or progesterone plus tamoxifen and tumour growth was monitored. As
previously seen (Figure 3b and Extended data figure 6), progesterone antagonised estrogeninduced tumour formation, as did tamoxifen alone, but the combination of tamoxifen plus
progesterone had the greatest tumour inhibitory effect (Figure 3f). This experiment was
repeated in a second xenograft model (T-47D cells), confirming the finding that tumour
volume was inhibited by progesterone alone, but the greatest degree of tumour inhibition
was observed under conditions where an ERα antagonist (tamoxifen) was coupled with a PR
agonist (progesterone) (Extended data figure 6).

PgR copy number alterations are common

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Given the PgR copy number loss observed in the MCF-7 cell line (Extended data figure 5),
we explored whether this was a common phenomenon observed in breast cancer patients, by
assessing genomic copy number alterations (CNA) within the METABRIC cohort of ~2,000
breast cancers29. This analysis revealed that 18.5% of all breast cancers possess a copy
number loss in the PgR genomic locus and these are biased towards ERα+ cases (Figure 4a).
This level of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been previously observed at this genomic
locus in a small cohort of patients30. In total, 21% of ERα+ breast cancers contain a
heterozygous or a homozygous deletion of the PgR genomic locus and these tumours had
significantly (p < 0.001) lower PR mRNA levels (Figure 4b). Importantly, within the 1,484
ERα+ cases, tumours with copy number loss of the PgR genomic region had a poorer
clinical outcome (p = 0.001) (Figure 4c), suggesting that inactivation of the PgR gene
contributes to worse outcome within this subset of ERα tumours.
ERα mRNA levels are significantly higher in tumours with PgR copy number loss (Figure
4d). Copy number loss of PgR affects gene expression events, since the expression level of
genes shown to be progestogen-induced under estrogenic conditions in the cell lines was
significantly lower (p < 0.001) in tumours with PgR copy number loss and, inversely, the
expression level of genes repressed by progestogens was significantly elevated (p = 0.001)
in tumours with an inactivated PgR gene (Figure 4e).

Using PAM50 breast cancer subtype stratification, 33% of luminal B tumours (typically
poor prognosis and PR low/negative) possessed copy number loss of the PgR genomic
region (Figure 4f), explaining the lower PR protein levels in one third of this breast cancer
subtype. In addition, even within the luminal A tumours only (which tend to have a better
outcome), 19% have a copy number loss of PgR and this subset of luminal A tumours have a
poorer clinical outcome (Extended data figure 9). Tumours were then stratified based on the
ten recently described genomic integrative clusters29, revealing three ERα+ subtypes (int.
clusters 1, 2 and 6) with at least 35% PgR copy number loss (Figure 4g). All three of these
integrative clusters have intermediate or poor clinical outcome (Figure 4g). Data showing
genomic copy number changes on the chromosome 11 arm that encompasses the PgR gene
are shown in Extended data figure 9. This level of PgR copy number loss was even higher in
an independent cohort of breast cancer patients: 29% of luminal (ERα+) breast cancers from
TCGA31 (Extended data figure 10). Within luminal B tumours only, 39% of TCGA breast
cancer cases had a PgR copy number loss.

Our data show that PR and ERα are functionally linked in breast cancer cells with a greater
complexity than previously recognised. Good prognosis luminal A ERα+ PR+ breast
tumours, when exposed to both estrogens and progestogens, have an ERα chromatin binding
profile that is dictated by PR binding events. The functional significance of this steroid
receptor crosstalk is regulation of a gene expression program associated with low
tumourigenicity; hence, better disease outcome. Genomic alterations in the PgR genomic
locus appear to be a relatively common mechanism for reduction of PR expression, which
may consequently lead to altered ERα chromatin binding and target gene expression
patterns that increase breast tumourigenicity and confers a poor clinical outcome. This ERαPR crosstalk may be directly influenced by many variables, including the relative receptor
levels and the hormonal milieu. The presence or absence of estrogen may significantly alter
the outcome of PR-ERα interactions, such that the anti-proliferative effects of PR activation
may be limited to estrogenic conditions. Our findings show that PR is not simply a marker
of a functional ERα complex18. Rather, we propose that PR is a critical determinant of ERα
function due to crosstalk between PR and ERα. In this scenario, under estrogenic conditions,
an activated PR functions as a proliferative brake in ERα+ breast tumours by re-directing
ERα chromatin binding and altering the expression of target genes that induce a switch from
a proliferative to a more differentiated state6.

ERα (Santa Cruz - sc-543, lot- A2213) and PR (Santa Cruz- sc-7208, lot H2312). 20 μgs of
each antibody was used for each RIME experiment.
Each RIME experiment was performed by mixing 20 million cells from each label after
respective drug treatments. Cells were treated with either progesterone (100 nM), R5020 (10
nM) or vehicle (ethanol). Two replicates of each experiment was performed and the results
were validated by switching the SILAC labels. The RIME method, Mass spectrometry and
data analysis were performed as previously described21.
Western Blot and Co-Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation experiments for ERα and PR were performed using Santa Cruz
antibodies. Antibodies used were ERα (sc-543) and PR (sc-7208). Western blots for ERα
and PR were performed using Novocastra antibodies (ERα: NCL-L-ER6F11 and PR: NCLL-PGR-AB).

−E2412). 10 μg of antibody was used for each experiment. Cells were treated with either
progesterone (100 nM), R5020 (10 nM) or vehicle (ethanol) and experiment was performed
in triplicates.

ChIP-seq data analysis
Statistical tests and cutoffs were selected based on published recommendations24.
RNA-seq

GSEA analysis

Integration of the RNA-Seq data and the ChIP-Seq DBA results were carried out using Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)35 as follows. All genes assessed by RNA-Seq were ranked
and weighted by their mean log2 fold change on progesterone treatments. Lists of genes that
overlapped with regions showing significant differential binding on progesterone treatment
were derived. These data were then analysed using the GSEA v2.0.13 GSEA Preranked tool.
Gene signature analysis
We derive a prognostic gene signature of consisting of progesterone regulated genes. We
included genes that were determined by RNA-seq (see above) as differentially up-regulated
in T47-D cells when subjected to progesterone/progestin, as well as having a differentially
bound ER binding site with increased binding affinity (determined using DiffBind) within
10kb of the transcription start site. 38 genes met these criteria(see Extended data figure 5).
This signature was validated using the METABRIC expression dataset (15), showing that
patients in the highest 10% of expression of genes in the signature exhibit significantly
better breast cancer specific survival than patients in the lowest 10% of expression
(p=7.36e-04); Extended data figure 5).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

As it has been shown that many gene signatures have significant power to predict outcome
in breast cancer (Venet et al), we subjected the signature to additional statistical tests using
the Bioconductor package SigCheck (Stark et al). We used SigCheck to generate a null
distribution of 1,000 signatures consisting of 38 genes selected at random, and computed
their survival p-values using the survival data for the 392 patients with high or low
expression over the progesterone induced genes. The progesterone induced signature
performed in the 99th percentile, with 1.2% of random signatures demonstrating an equal or
lessor p-value (empirical p-value=0.012; Extended data figure 5). Considering previously
identified cancer signatures, of the 189 oncogenic signatures identified in MSigDB
(Subramanian et al), 11 had equal or lessor p-values, placing the progesterone regulation
signature in the 94th percentile (empirical p-value=0.058). All the code for analysis is
available upon request.

Clinical samples—Breast tumour samples and relevant clinical data were obtained from
women undergoing surgery at the Burnside Private Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, with
informed, written consent. This study was approved by the University of Adelaide Human

Tissue collection and processing—Excised tissue samples were delivered to the
laboratory on ice within one hour following surgery and washed in culture medium
comprised of phenol red-free RPMI (SAFC Biosciences, Kansas, USA), 200 mM glutamine

tumour tissues were cultured ex vivo as previously described28. In brief, tumour pieces
(explants) were pre-incubated on gelatine sponges (3-4 per sponge) for 36 hours in culture
media containing 10% FCS, followed by treatment with hormones as indicated in culture
media containing 10% steroid depleted FCS. The conditions used were: vehicle, estradiol
(10 nM), R5020 (10 nM) and the combination of estradiol and R5020 (both at 10 nM) with
hormone treatment conducted for 48 hours. Representative pieces of tissue were fixed in 4%
formalin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C overnight and subsequently processed
into paraffin blocks. Sections (2 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined
by a pathologist to confirm and quantify the presence/proportion of tumour cells.
Immunohistochemistry—Primary antibodies to detect ERα (ID5 1:300; DAKO
#M7047, Glostrup, Denmark), PR (1:1000, Leica #NCL-PgR-AB, Wetzlar, Germany) or
Ki67 (MIB1 1:400; DAKO #M7240 Glostrup, Denmark) were used in conjunction with a
1:400 dilution of a biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min (DAKO #E0433,
Glostrup, Denmark) followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (DAKO
#P0397, Glostrup, Denmark). Visualization of immunostaining was performed using 3,3Diaminobenzidine (Sigma #D9015), as previously described36.

Image capture and quantification of Ki67 immunostaining—Slides were scanned
at 40X magnification (NanoZoomerTM Microscopy System, Hamamatsu, Japan) and the
digitized images edited to exclude non-glandular structures. A minimum of 10 highresolution images from Nanozoomer files of all segments were recorded. Brown pixels
(Ki67) and blue pixels (haematoxylin) were extracted from each image using Adobe
Photoshop and the Colour Range tool and a fuzziness factor of 20. Extracted pixels were
converted to greyscale format and a consistent threshold applied. Absolute numbers and
proportion of Ki67-positive cells were determined using ImageJ software and the Analyse
Particles tool with a circularity index of 0.2-1. An average of 14,000 cells were quantified
per sample. Accuracy of automatic quantification was determined using an independent set
of images that were assessed by an offsite independent observer who manually counted
Ki67-positive and Ki67-negative cells in high-resolution images systematically sampled
from an individual patient sample (containing >6,500 cells). Identical images were analysed
by automatic quantification with consistency between manual and automatic counting of
>95%. A linear mixed-effects model of percentage Ki67-positive cells versus type of
treatment, adjusting for clustering on patient, was used to assess statistical significance.
Immunofluorescence—5μm sections were cut and adhered to Superfost UltraPlus slides
(Menzel-Glasser Braunscweig, Germany) and baked on a warm block at 60°C for 1 hour.
Sections were dewaxed in 3 × 5 min immersions of xylene followed by 3 × 5 min
immersions in 100% ethanol. Sections were rehydrated in 2 × 5 min immersions in 70%
ethanol followed by 2 × 5 min immersions in distilled H2O. Next, antigen retrieval was

performed in 600 mL of 1 mM Na-EDTA (pH 8.0) by heating in an 800W microwave until
boiling (approximately 5 min), allowing slides to stand for 5 min before microwaving at
50% power for an additional 5 min. Slides were allowed to cool in antigen retrieval buffer
for 60 min before transferring to PBS for 5 min. Sections were encircled with a wax pen and
primary antibody diluted in PBS with 10% normal goat serum was applied overnight at 4°C
(rat anti-ERα – 1:100 (Abcam #ab46186); mouse anti-PR – 1:500 (Dako #NCL-PgR-AB);
rabbit anti-Ki67 – 1:100 (Abcam #ab16667). Sections were washed twice for 5 min in PBS,
followed by incubation with secondary antibody diluted (all at 1:400) in PBS with 10%
normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature (goat anti-rat Alexa488 (#A11006); goat
anti-mouse Alexa569 (#A11031); goat anti-rabbit Alexa647, (#A21246.), Life
Technologies). Sections were washed twice for 5 min in PBS, followed by incubation with 1
nM DAPI diluted in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. Sections were mounted under
DAKO fluorescent mounting media (#S3023) and each fluorescent channel captured
separately using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.
PgR copy number analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Matched DNA and RNA were extracted for 1,980 tumours. The copy number analysis was
performed using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform. The arrays were first preprocessed and
normalised using CRMAv237 method from the aroma.affymetrix R package. For each array,
allelic-crosstalk calibration, probe sequence effects normalisation, probe-level
summarisation and PCR fragment length normalisation were performed. Then the intensities
were normalised against a pool of 473 normals for those samples that had no matched
normal or against their matched normal when available. The log-ratios were segmented
using the CBS algorithm38 in the DNAcopy Bioconductor package. Then, callings into five
groups (homozygous deletion, heterozygous deletion, neutral copy number, gain and
amplification), were made using thresholds based on the variability of each sample and their
proportion of normal contamination. Then, samples were classified as PgR loss if they
showed any type of loss in any part of the gene.
RNA analysis was performed using Illumina HT-12 v3 platform and analysed using
beadarray package39. BASH40 algorithm was employed to correct for spatial artifacts. Beadlevel data was summarized and a selection of suitable probes based on their quality was
done using the re-annotation of the Illumina HT-12v3 platform41. The samples were
classified into the five breast cancer subtypes using PAM5042 and the 10 integrative
clusters29. Two-sided t-tests were performed between expression values and loss of PGR to
determine significance. Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests were obtained using the
survival R package (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival). Comparison of the
expression of the stringent progesterone/R5020 induced or repressed genes in samples with
PGR lost and not lost was performed averaging the expression of all the genes and running a
two-sided t-test.
Xenograft experiments
Mice were maintained, and regulated procedures performed, according to UK Home Office
project license guidelines. Sample size was calculated using a combination of the NC3Rs
recommended Resource Equation method, and also prior knowledge of the experimental

variability of breast cancer cell line xenografts in NSG animals. All in vivo experiments
were performed using age matched female NOD/SCID/IL2Rg−/− (NSG) mice and all
experiments were blinded. Animals were selected using the following criteria: sex (female)
and age matched (where possible litter mates were used) to reduce variability; only animals
in excellent health used (verified pathogen free and in excellent physical health); all animals
were certified as NSG strain. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups using a
random number generator at the beginning of the study. Briefly, mice were injected
subcutaneously into the No 4 inguinal mammary fat pad with a suspension of 105 MCF7Luc2/YFP cells in 50% growth factor reduced MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences). Where
appropriate, 90 day slow-releasing 17b-estradiol (0.72 mg/pellet) and/or progesterone (10
mg/pellet) hormone pellets (Innovative Research of America) were implanted
subcutaneously in recipient mice. Tumour growth was monitored using regular
bioluminescent imaging (IVIS) and caliper measurement. Data were analysed using the
GraphPad Prism statistical software package. Standard deviations within groups were
similar and substantially less than the variation between the treatment groups. Sample size
was determined by a pilot experiment with smaller number of mice. Mice used for all
experiments were age and litter matched (3 months) to reduce variability. 15 mice were
injected with tumours and then 5 mice were selected at random for each treatment arm.
Treatments were blinded using coded cages. Mice were regularly assessed for health and
endpoint was determined on regulatory guidelines for tumour size.

For Tamoxifen experiments, age matched female NSG mice were injected as above with
either 105 MCF7-Luc2/YFP cells or 107 T-47D-Luc2/mStrawberry cells in 50% growth
factor reduced MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences). Concomitantly, a 90 day slow-release 17bestradiol (0.72 mg/pellet) (Innovative Research of America) was implanted subcutaneously.
One week later either 90 day slow-release progesterone (10 mg/pellet) hormone or placebo
pellets (Innovative Research of America) were implanted subcutaneously, and Tamoxifen/
Vehicle administration was commenced. 100 μL Tamoxifen (5 mg/mL) or vehicle (sterile
filtered corn oil) were administered i.p. to a schedule of 3 days dosing/1 day rest for a total
duration of 4 weeks (MCF7) or 8 weeks (T-47D). Tumour sizes were monitored as above.
Each treatment arm consisted of 10 tumours.
For ovariectomisation experiments, age matched female NSG mice were injected as before
with 105 MCF7-Luc2/YFP cells in 50% growth factor reduced MatrigelTM (BD
Biosciences), and 90 day slow-release 17b-estradiol (0.72 mg/pellet) and/or progesterone

implanted subcutaneously in recipient mice. Concomitantly, ovariectomisation was
performed. Tumour sizes were monitored as above for 7 weeks. Each treatment arm
