ABSTRACT
The mechanism of resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to sorafenib
is unknown and no useful predictive biomarker for sorafenib treatment has been
reported. Accordingly, we established sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and investigated
the underlying mechanism of resistance to sorafenib. Sorafenib-resistant cell lines
were established from the HCC cell line PLC/PRF5 by cultivation under continuous
exposure to increasing concentration of sorafenib. The IC50 values of the 2 resistant
clones PLC/PRF5-R1 and PLC-PRF5-R2 were 9.2±0.47 μM (1.8-fold) and 25±5.1
μM (4.6-fold) respectively, which were significantly higher than that of parental
PLC/PRF5 cells (5.4±0.17 μM) (p<0.01 respectively), as determined by MTT assay.
Western blot analysis of signal transduction-related proteins showed no significant
differences in expression of AKT/pAKT, mTOR/pmTOR, or ERK/pERK between the
2 resistant clones versus parent cells, suggesting no activation of an alternative
signal transduction pathway. Likewise, when expression of membrane transporter
proteins was determined, there were no significant differences in expression levels of
BSEP, MDR1, MRP2, BCRP, MRP4 and OCT1 between resistant clones and parent cells.
However, the expression levels of MRP3 in the 2 resistant clones were significantly
higher than that of parent cells. When MRP3 gene was knocked down by siRNA in PLCPRF5-R2 cells, the sensitivity of the cells to sorafenib was restored. In the analysis
of gene mutation, there was no mutation in the activation segment of Raf1 kinase in
the resistant clones. Our data clearly demonstrate that the efflux transporter MRP3
plays an important role in resistance to sorafenib in HCC cells.

(VEGFR), significantly improved overall survival in
patients with advanced HCC in large-scaled multicenter
phase III trials [4,5]. Therefore, systemic treatment with
sorafenib is currently recommended for advanced stage
HCC in the treatment algorithm of HCC worldwide [6].
However, the response rate for sorafenib in HCC is very
low (i.e., 2 - 3%) [4,5].
Abou-Alfa and associates investigated pERK
expression in HCC tissues by immunohistochemistry, and
demonstrated that pERK expression is closely associated
with the effect of sorafenib [7]. This is reasonable because
sorafenib blocks Raf kinase thereby inhibiting the
downstream MEK/ERK pathway. However, contradictory
results have been reported. Patients with high expression

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the thirdleading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1].
Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced
stage, when curative therapies, such as surgical resection
and percutaneous ablation, are of limited utility. Since
a majority of HCC present intrinsic resistance to many
cytotoxic anti-cancer agents, interventional treatment
such as transarterial embolization had been applied for
advanced HCC [2,3]. Recently, it has been reported that
sorafenib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
blocks Raf kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors

of pERK, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry,
showed significantly shorter overall survivalthan those
with low expression of pERK [8,9]. Therefore, it remains
unclear whether pERK is a predictor of the therapeutic
response to sorafenib in HCC. Thus, no useful predictive
biomarker for the therapeutic response to sorafenib has
been identified to date. Chen and associates established
sorafenib-resistant cell lines from the HCC cell line Huh7
[10]. They investigated the mechanism of resistance to
sorafenib in these cells, and demonstrated that the AKT/
mTOR pathway was alternatively activated instead of
the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway that was blocked by
sorafenib in resistant clones. However, it is unknown
whether or not activation of this alternative pathway is
entirely responsible for sorafenib resistance.
It is well known that multidrug resistant transporter
proteins such as MDR1 and MRP2 are overexpressed in
many kinds of cancer cells that are resistant to anticancer
drugs. Overexpression of MDR1 has beenreported to be
associated with resistance to several anticancer drugs
in hematological malignancies, brain tumors, lung
cancers, renal cell cancers, and ovarian cancers [11–16].
Overexpression of MRP2 is also reportedly associated
with resistance to anticancer drugs in lung cancers, renal
cell cancers, bladder cancer and colorectal cancers [17–
20]. Since there are many transporters in hepatocytes,
including MDR1 and MRP2, it is plausible that
theiroverexpression is involved in resistance to sorafenib.
However, there have been no reports that haveinvestigated
this possible relationship between sorafenib resistance and
transporter expression. In addition, it has been reported
that drug resistance to molecular targeting agents is
sometimes induced by genetic mutation in the targeted
molecules. The resistance to imatinib in gastrointestinal

stromal tumors (GISTs)is acquired by a mutation in the
ATP binding site of c-kit, a molecular target of imatinib
[21,22]. Similarly, the resistance to gefitinib is acquired
in lung cancer by a mutation of EGFR gene, a target
molecule of gefitinib [23,24]. However, there have been
no reports that have investigated mutations of Raf1 kinase,
an important target molecule forsorafenib.
Therefore, in this study, we first established
sorafenib-resistant cell lines, and investigated expression
of AKT/pAKT and mTOR/pmTOR, key molecules
in the alternative PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway. We
then investigated the expression of several important
membrane transporter proteins in the resistant cells. We
finally performed mutational analysis of molecular targets
of sorafenib in resistant cells.

RESULTS
Resistance of PLC/PRF5-R1 and PLC/PRF5-R2
clones to sorafenib
We first established a sorafenib-resistant cell line
(mixed population) from parental PLC/PRF5 cells, and
isolated 2 sorafenib-resistant clones by using a limitingdilution method as described in Materials and Methods.
We then examined IC50 values of the 2 clones (PLC/
PRF5-R1, PLC/PRF5-R2) by MTT assay (Figure 1).
The IC50 values for PLC/PRF5-R1 and PLC-PRF5-R2
were 9.2 ± 0.47 μM (1.8-fold) and 25 ± 5.1 μM (4.6-fold)
respectively, demonstrating significantly higher values
than that of parental cells (5.4 ± 0.17 μM) (p<0.01 and
p<0.01, respectively). Thus, we were able to establish
sorafenib-resistant clones that showed weak or strong
resistance to sorafenib.

Expression of AKT/pAKT and mTOR/pmTOR
in sorafenib-resistant clones

No mutation in the activation segment of Raf1
kinase in resistant clones

To examine if the alternative AKT/mTOR
pathway is activated in the resistant clones, we
investigated expression of AKT/pAKT and mTOR/
pmTOR in these cells by Western blot analysis (Figure
2). However, no significant difference was observed in
the bands for pAKT and AKT between resistant clones
and parent cells. Likewise, no significant difference
was observed in the expression of pmTOR and mTOR
between resistant clones and parent cells. Thus, it
became evident that the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
was not activated in our sorafenib-resistant clones. In
addition, in the analysis of ERK/pERK expression,
no significant difference was observed between the
resistant clones and parent cells.

Since sorafenib blocks the MAP kinase pathway
mainly by inhibiting Raf1 kinase, we examined if there
is a mutation in the activation segment of Raf1 kinase
that involves binding with sorafenib (Figure 5). No
mutation was detected in any of the sequences of exons
13 and 14 (activation segment) in the genomic DNA of
PLC/PRF5-R1 and PLC/PRF5-R2 cells. These sequences
were completely identical to those of parental cells. This
suggests that sorafenib- resistance in PLC/PRF5-R1 and
PLC/PRF5-R2 cells is not induced by mutation of the
Raf1 gene.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we established 2 sorafenib-resistant
clones from the HCC cell line PLC/PRF5, and showed
that themembrane transporter MRP3 was overexpressed
in these clones. Moreover, knockdown of the MRP3 gene
in these clones restored sensitivity to sorafenib. These data
strongly suggest that MRP3 is a novel resistance factor for
sorafenib. This is the first report showing a close association
between sorafenib resistance and overexpression of a
membrane transporter. Chen and associates reported that
they established 2 sorafenib-resistant clones from theHCC
cell line Huh7 [10]. Although they did not present IC50
values of the 2 sorafenib-resistant clones, the values appear
to be about 10 μM based on the figure from their paper,
and this represents 2-fold or less resistance relativeto parent
cells. On the other hand, our 2resistant clones showed
1.8-fold and 4.6-fold resistance to sorafenib relative to
parent cells. We believe that resistant cells with at least
3-fold or more resistance relative toparental cells shouldbe
used for investigation of drug resistance. Moreover, Chen
et al. demonstrated that the AKT/mTOR pathway was
alternatively activated in their resistant clones. However,
our resistant clones, with 1.8-fold and 4.6-fold resistance,
did not show any enhancement of AKT/mTOR signals
(Figure 2). The reason for this difference is unclear butmay
be due to differences in the cell lines used. Moreover,
although there no data are available on the expression of
membrane transporters in their clones, it is possible that
MRP3 is overexpressed in those cells. Since a majority of
previous in vitro studies on sorafenib have used the HCC
cell line PLC/PRF5 [25–27], we used these cells to establish
sorafenib-resistance cell lines in the present study.
MRP3 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
that is expressed in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes
and effluxes organic ions and glucuronide conjugates into
the blood [28]. It is known that MRP3 is expressed in normal
hepatocytes and it is reportedly sometimes overexpressed in
HCC cells to various degrees [29]. Moreover, it has been

Up-regulation of MRP3 in sorafenib-resistant clones
We investigated protein expression levels of
major efflux transporters (BSEP, MDR1, MRP2,
BCRP and MRP3) and influx transporters (MRP4
and OCT1) in PLC/PRF5-R1, PLC/PRF5-R2 and
PLC/PRF5 cells by Western blot analysis (Figure 3).
There were no significant differences in the bands
for BSEP, MDR1, MRP2, BCRP, MRP4 and OCT1
among PLC/PRF5-R1, PLC/PRF5-R2 and PLC/
PRF5 cells. However, the expression level of MRP3
was higher in PLC/PRF5-R1 and was even higher in
PLC/PRF5-R2 cells than in PLC/PRF5 cells. Thus,
the efflux transporter MRP3 was up-regulated in
sorafenib-resistant clones depending on the strength
of resistance, suggesting that MRP3 protein transports
sorafenib outside the cells resulting in acquisition of
sorafenib resistance.

Knockdown of MRP3 restored sorafenib
sensitivity
In order to prove that MRP3 is closely associated
with sorafenib resistance, we knocked down theMRP3
gene in PLC/PRF5-R2 cells using siRNA and
investigated the change of sensitivity to sorafenib. The
relative mRNA levels of MRP3 in the knocked-down
cells (PLC/PRF5-R2/si) were suppressed to 20% or less
at 24 – 72 h after transfection of siRNA as compared
with that of control cells (PLC/PRF5-R2/ra) (Figure 4A).
The IC50 value of PLC/PRF5-R2/si cells was 7.2 ± 1.9
μM, which was significantly lower than that of control
cells (15.9 ± 2.1 μM) (Figure 4B). Thus, knockdown of
MRP3 in sorafenib-resistant cells restored sensitivity to
sorafenib, suggesting that MRP3 plays an important role
for acquisition of resistance to sorafenib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

reported that MRP3 is involved in resistance to etoposide
and MTX in ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells [30,31].
Thus, it is plausible that HCC shows resistance to sorafenib
depending on the extent of MRP3 expression. In fact,
MRP3 was highly expressed in the HCC tissues that never
responded to sorafenib treatment (3/5) but not in those that
responded (0/4) by immunohistochemistry although the
number of tissues (patients) examined was relatively small
(Supplementary Figure S1).
Currently sorafenib is approved for the treatment of
HCC and renal cell carcinoma [32,33]. Since it is known
that MRP3 is expressed not only in hepatocytes but also
in renal cells [34], MRP3 may play an important role as a
resistance factor in renal cell carcinoma.
Sorafenib undergoes oxidative metabolism
mediated by cytochrome p450 3A4 primarily to sorafenib
N-oxide [35]. Sorafenib and its oxidized metabolites
undergo glucuronidation by UGT1A9 in hepatocytes,
and is either excreted into bile and eliminated via feces
or into the bloodstream and eliminated via urine [36].
However, it is currently unknown which transporters
excrete glucuronide- sorafenib metabolites into bile or
blood. MRP3 is a well-known transporter of glucuronide
conjugates including etoposide and MTX into urine.
Therefore, our data suggest that glucuronide conjugates
of sorafenib metabolites are excreted by MRP3 into urine.
Sorafenib was originally developed to inhibit
Raf1 kinase, and it exhibits a high antitumor activity by
inhibiting RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction. Since
the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is activated in a majority
of HCC tissues [37], it is possible that a mutation occurs
in the Raf1 gene, in particular in its activation segment,
which is directly involved in binding to sorafenib in
sorafenib-resistant cells. However, we did not find any
mutations in thissegment of our sorafenib-resistant clones.
Moreover, no mutations were detected in the ATP binding
site of Raf1 kinase in these cells (Supplementary Figure
S2). It has been reported that secondary mutations of
the c-kit and EGFR genes confer acquired resistance to
imatinib in GISTs and gefitinib in lung cancer respectively
[22,24]. These tumor cells have initialmutations as driver
gene mutations, whereas HCC has few mutations in the
Raf1 kinase gene. In addition, sorafenib inhibits not
only Raf1 kinase but also B-Raf, PDGFR, VEGFR, and
other tyrosine kinases. In this context, it is reasonable
that genetic mutation is not involved in the resistance to
sorafenib, although we cannot rule out thepossibility that
there are mutations in other tyrosine kinases targeted by
sorafenib in these resistant clones.
In conclusion, we established 2 sorafenibresistant clones (PLC-PRF5-R1 and -R2) from the HCC
cell line PLC/PRF5. These resistant clones showed
overexpression of MRP3 but not other membrane
transporters, and knockdown of MRP3 in the resistant
clones restored the sensitivity to sorafenib. These results
strongly suggest that MRP3 is a novel resistance factor
for sorafenibin HCC cells.

Cell culture and compounds
The representative human hepatoma cell line, PLC/
PRF5, was purchased from American Tissue Culture
Collection (ATCC). PLC/PRF5 cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2mM L-gultamine. Sorafenib (LKT Laboratory, St
Paul, MN) was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, Invitrogen Sigma-Aldrich) at 40 mM and stored
at −20°C.

Establishment of sorafenib-resistant cell line
PLC/PRF5 cells were continuously exposed
to increasing concentrations of sorafenib over 24
months. Starting cell culture with 5.4 μM of sorafenib
concentration (IC50 for PCL/PRF5 cells), the exposure
dose was increased by 0.5 to 1 μM every month until
reaching 3 times the IC50 inparent cells. Subsequently,
cloning was performed by the limiting dilution method.

Cell viability analysis
Cell viability was assessed by using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5- diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, cells were seeded in 96well plates (5000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h at
37°C. Then, sorafenib was added to the wells at various
concentrations, and the plates were incubated for another
72 h at 37°C. MTT dye solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) was added to the wells, and the plates were
incubated at 37°C for 4 h, followed by addition of stop
solution (isopropanol with 0.04 N HCl). Absorbance at
570 nm was determined on a (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
plate reader. IC50 values were determined by non-linear
regression analysis. Values are given as mean ± standard
deviation of 5 experiments.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mMol/L Tris pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1% NP40, 0.5% Nadesoxycholate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4)
containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell
lysates were analyzed for protein content, resolved by
sodium dodecylsulfate-polyamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE), and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes using a semi-dry transfer apparatus
or wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked
with 5% fat-free dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween
(TBS-T) buffer for 1 h and then incubated overnight
with rabbit anti-phospho-Akt polyclonal antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, Tokyo, Japan), rabbit anti-Akt
