BACKGROUND: Phase 1 studies demonstrated evidence of recombinant human IL-18 (rhIL-18)-mediated
immunomodulatory and clinical activity, and defined a biologically active dose range. METHODS: A phase 2
study of rhIL-18 was conducted in untreated AJCC stage IV melanoma. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3
dose groups (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg/d) of rhIL-18 administered as 5 daily intravenous infusions repeated
every 28 days. A 2-stage design with a stopping rule was used. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients (median
age, 57.5 years) with metastatic melanoma (M1a/b (30), M1c (34)) were accrued to stage I, and randomized
to 3 groups (21 [0.01 mg/kg/d], 21 [0.1 mg/kg/d], 22 [1.0 mg/kg/d]). Five patients experienced 10 grade 3
drug-related adverse events (AEs): polyarthritis (1 subject: 0.01 mg/kg); deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism (1:0.01 mg/kg); cognitive disorder (1:0.1 mg/kg); fatigue, dyspnea, pleural effusion, lymphopenia
(1:1.0 mg/kg); fatigue, lymphopenia (1:1.0 mg/kg). One patient experienced a grade 4 AE of increased lipase
(0.1 mg/kg) that led to permanent discontinuation from the study. Among 63 subjects evaluable for
response, 1 (M1c; 0.01 mg/kg) achieved a partial response after 4 cycles. Four subjects (3 at 0.01 mg/kg
and 1 at 1.0 mg/kg) had stable disease maintained for 6 months or longer. Due to the low apparent level of
clinical efficacy using RECIST criteria, the study was terminated at the end of stage 1. The median progression free survival for the 3 groups was 7.5 (0.01), 7.4 (0.1), and 7.3 (1.0) weeks. CONCLUSIONS: rIL-18 as
tested in this trial was well tolerated, but had limited activity as a single agent in patients with metastatic

are of limited value. Dacarbazine as a single agent induces
objective responses in less than 10% of patients in recent
randomized controlled trials, and an impact on survival
has never been shown for this or any other single agent.2
Combination chemotherapy regimens have shown
improved response rates but also failed to confer a survival
benefit.3,4
Immunotherapy using interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
IFN-a has produced the most promising and durable
results to date in metastatic melanoma. High-dose IL-2
was approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (US FDA) on the basis of a retrospective
analysis of 270 patients that demonstrated an objective
response rate of 16%, including 6% complete responses,
and with 60% of complete responders remaining progression-free at 5 years.5 The major toxicity and cost associated with high dose IL-2 has restricted its use to selected
patients at major medical centers. High dose IFN-a2b
also received US FDA approval in the adjuvant setting after demonstrating relapse-free and overall survival benefits
in randomized clinical trials.6-8 Biochemotherapy regimens had no impact on survival in randomized controlled
trials when compared with chemotherapy alone.9-11
Given the relative success immunotherapeutic
approaches have achieved in this disease, the evaluation of
new, potentially less toxic immunologic agents capable of
altering the Th1/Th2 bias of the immune system, such as
IL-18, was of interest. IL-18 is a small nonglycosylated
monomer of 18 kd, belonging to the IL-1 cytokine family,
which is capable of mediating several immunostimulatory
effects relevant to the induction of cellular antitumor immunity. It enhances the release of proinflammatory (Th1)
cytokines and the activation of natural killer (NK) cells.
In addition, IL-18 has been shown to promote the differentiation of naive CD4 þ T lymphocytes into Th1 cells
and the development of memory cytotoxic CD8 þ T lymphocytes. IL-18 also acts synergistically with IL-12 to
induce IFN-c production and stimulate Th1 immune
response.12,13 Other regulatory functions of IL-18 that
may be important in its antitumor activity include the upregulation of Fas ligand on NK and T cells.14-16
IL-18 has been studied in a variety of preclinical tumor models demonstrating IL-18 mediated cellular immunity and antitumor effects17-22 In addition to IL-18
stimulatory effects on NK and T lymphocytes, investigations demonstrated activation of B lymphocytes leading

to immunoglobulin production and possible antibodymediated cellular cytotoxicity as well as antiangiogenic activity when administered alone and in combination with
IL-12.14-16,23-25 Taken together, these findings supported
further investigation of recombinant human IL-18 (rhIL18; SB-485232).
In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, rhIL-18 was
administered for a single cycle as a 2-hour intravenous
(IV) infusion for 5 consecutive days to subjects with
advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. Doses ranging
from 0.003-1.0 mg/kg/d were administered. A total of 28
subjects were treated at dose levels up to 1.0 mg/kg/d for
5 days without reaching a maximally tolerated dose
(MTD). Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated daily dosing
for 5 days produced 2.5-fold accumulations with a 35hour accumulation half-life. Preliminary data demonstrated evidence of immunomodulatory activity (increase
in serum proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of
Fas ligand on NK and T cells) and clinical activity
(unconfirmed partial responses) observed in 2 patients
(metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma) treated at
0.1 mg/kg/d.26
A repeat cycle study with rhIL-18 administered
intravenously for 5 days every 28 days tested 3 doses (0.1,
0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/d) in subjects with advanced solid
tumors and follicular lymphoma. Preliminary data with 9
subjects showed that rhIL-18 was well tolerated and did
not exceed a MTD at doses up to 1 mg/kg/d. This study
helped define a biologically active dose range with 4 of 9
patients completing 6 cycles of treatment with stable disease and 2 patients (1 at 0.5 and 1 at 1.0 mg/kg/d) continuing to receive treatment for 12 and 10 months,
respectively.27
Based on these preclinical and phase 1 clinical
results, this phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the
antitumor activity of 3 dose groups of rhIL-18 administered as a single agent in subjects with previously
untreated metastatic melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Adult subjects with histologically confirmed inoperable
and treatment-naive metastatic melanoma were eligible
for this study. Additional eligibility criteria included an
Cancer

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function
parameters. Patients were ineligible if they had a history
of, or active brain metastases, or ocular melanoma as the
primary tumor. Prior adjuvant therapy for resected metastatic disease was permitted. All patients of the described
research provided written informed consent.

Study Design and Treatment
In this phase 2, open-label, randomized study, subjects
were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 0.01, 0.1,
and 1.0 mg/kg/d. A complete cycle consisted of 5 consecutive days of rhIL-18 as a 2-hour IV infusion followed by
a 23-day rest period. Cycles were repeated every 28 days
for up to 6 cycles.

Toxicity and Response Assessments
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) was used for grading
toxicities.
Disease assessment consisted of radiographic imaging (ie, CT or magnetic resonance imaging scans), color
photographic imaging, and/or physical examination. Disease response was determined according to the RECIST
criteria.28 All subjects had their screening disease assessments reviewed by an independent radiology reviewer
(IRR). In addition, any subject who completed more that
2 treatment cycles had their radiographic imaging studies
reviewed by the IRR. Only responses confirmed by the
IRR were included in the primary endpoint for this study.

Dose Modifications
Study drug-related toxicities requiring 50% dose reduction included grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicities;
grade 4 hematological toxicities; any isolated or recurrent
grade 2 drug-related toxicity, which in the judgment of
the investigator required dose reduction; any drug-related
toxicity resulting in a delay of >14 days in the start of the
next cycle; and any drug-related toxicity resulting in the
subject missing 2 doses during a given cycle. If upon retreatment at a reduced dose, there was recurrent or new
drug-related toxicity requiring dose modification, the subject was discontinued.

Statistical Methods
The primary objective was efficacy defined by tumor
response rate (RR). Secondary efficacy analyses included
progression-free survival (PFS), response duration, and
time to response.
This study used a 2-stage design with a stopping rule
to allow early termination of any 1 of 3 arms for lack of efficacy. In stage 1, 60 subjects were planned to be randomized to 1 of 3 dosing groups. If there were <2 responders
among 20 evaluable subjects in a particular arm, then this
would lead to early termination of that particular dosing
group. If there were 2 or more responders in stage I within
a given arm, then the study was to proceed to stage II with
20 additional subjects recruited to that particular arm.
The probability of early termination for a given arm if the
true response rate was 5% is 0.74. If the true response rate
was 20%, then the probability of stopping is low at 0.07.
The overall probability of falsely declaring the treatment
effective for a given stratum at the end of stage II, if it has
a response rate of 5%, is less than 0.05, the type 1 error.
The study was not powered to provide direct comparison
between arms, nor was the study powered for the PFS
endpoint.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The investigators of this multicenter study failed to
restrict enrollment to 60 subjects at the end of stage 1, and
therefore 4 additional subjects had been enrolled by the
time the study was put on hold for interim analysis. A
total of 64 patients with AJCC stage IV melanoma were
enrolled between November 2004 and June 2005, and all
patients were evaluable for efficacy according to protocol
requirements, except 1 subject whose only target lesion at
baseline was in a prior radiation field. Patients were
randomized to 1 of 3 dosing groups (21 subjects [0.01
mg/kg/d], 21 [0.1 mg/kg/d], 22 [1.0 mg/kg/d]). Among
these patients, 27 were female and 37 male, with a median
age of 57.5 years (range, 26-88 years) years. Thirty
patients had AJCC stage Mla/b and 34 had Mlc.1 A total of
52 patients had primary cutaneous melanoma and 12 had
melanoma of unknown primary. Prior adjuvant therapy
included cytokine therapy (N ¼ 15), vaccine (N ¼ 4),
chemotherapy (N ¼ 4), and radiation (N ¼ 9). Forty-four

patients had an ECOG PS 0 (normal), 19 had PS 1 (ambulatory), and for 1 patient the PS is unknown. Baseline
patient and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Treatment Details
Thirty-five patients completed 1-2 cycles of therapy, 11
received 3-4 cycles, 7 received 5-6 cycles, and 11 received
more than 6 cycles. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression (57 patients,
89%). Treatment details are summarized in Table 2.
Two (3%) subjects (at 1.0 mg/kg) required dose
reductions because of weight loss and rash, respectively.
862

Nine (14%) subjects had a total of 11 dose delays, including 4 subjects at 0.01 mg/kg, 2 at 0.1 mg/kg, and 2 at 1.0
mg/kg. Of the 11 dose delays, 8 were due to administrative or scheduling issues. Three subjects experienced dose
delays due to toxicity (grade 2 bacteremia and cellulitis,
grade 3 pleural effusion, grade 3 cellulitis), none assessed
as related to study drug.
Efficacy
Sixty-three subjects were considered evaluable for efficacy.
For 1 subject, the only measurable lesion was determined
by the IRR to be in a prior radiation field, a violation of

exclusion criteria. As a result, the IRR considered this subject not evaluable for efficacy.
One subject with M1c disease achieved a partial
response at the end of cycle 4 that was confirmed by the
IRR, which was maintained until the end of cycle 8. In
addition, 2 subjects (at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) achieved an
unconfirmed partial response at the end of cycle 4 but at
the next disease assessment (end of cycle 6) 1 subject
developed progressive disease based upon review by the
IRR. For the second subject, the IRR considered the overall response at the end of cycle 4 to be an unconfirmed
PR. The investigator, however, considered the response at
the end of cycle 4 to be PD based on the appearance of a
new subcutaneous lesion, although there was a significant
reduction (34%) in the size of the target lesion.
Four subjects maintained stable disease for 6 months
or longer as assessed by the IRR. Three of these subjects
were at the 0.01 mg/kg dose and 1 at the 1.0 mg/kg dose.
At the conclusion of stage 1, at least 2 confirmed responses
were not identified by the IRR in any arm; therefore, the
study did not progress to stage II and was terminated at
the end of stage 1 per protocol design.
Based on time from randomization to end of study
treatment enrollment, the median intervals for on-study
duration (in days) were 114 (0.01 mg/kg/d), 57 (0.1 mg/

between dose groups were observed. The median PFS for
the 3 groups was 7.5 (95% CI, 7.1-15.3) (0.01 mg/kg/d),
7.4 (95% CI, 7.1-7.7) (0.1 mg/kg/d), and 7.3 (95% CI,
7.1-7.4) (1.0 mg/kg/d) weeks. Time to response for the 1
IRR-confirmed partial responder was 107 days. The 4month PFS rates were 20% (95% CI, 8.3%-48.1%) for
the 0.01 mg/kg/d dose group, 5.3% (95% CI, 0.8%35.5%) for the 0.1 mg/kg/d dose group, and 0% for the 1
mg/kg/d dose group.
Safety
Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported for 62
(97%) subjects in this study. The most frequently
reported nonhematologic drug-related AEs in at least 7
subjects are summarized in Table 3. The most frequently
reported nonhematologic grade 3 or higher AEs are summarized in Table 4. Overall, the majority of these AEs
were more common in the highest dose level (1.0 mg/kg/
d). No significant differences in incidence were noted
between the 2 lower dose levels. The most common hematologic abnormalities are summarized in Table 5 and
included lymphopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. The
majority of hematologic lab abnormalities were grade 1-2.
The most common chemistry laboratory abnormalities
were generally grade 1-2 in severity and these are summarized in Table 6.

A total of 5 patients experienced 10 grade 3 AEs that
were believed to be drug-related, including polyarthritis
(1 subject, 0.01 mg/kg); deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (1, 0.01 mg/kg); cognitive disorder (1,

increased lipase (0.1 mg/kg) that was believed to be drugrelated and led to permanent discontinuation from the
study.
In addition to lymphopenia, other grade 3 or higher

laboratory abnormalities included grade 3 hyperglycemia
(N ¼ 4), hyperkalemia (N ¼ 1), hypernatremia (N ¼ 1),
elevation in AST (N ¼ 1) and alkaline phosphatase (N ¼

died during the study had serious adverse events reported
including dyspnea (1 subject, 0.1 mg/kg) and abdominal
pain (1 subject, 1.0 mg/kg). Both events were considered
to be related to underlying disease progression and were
not considered drug-related. A total of 7 subjects died
during this study. All deaths were due to either the disease
under study or disease progression and occurred 24 days
following the last dose of study drug.

Eight subjects were permanently discontinued from
the study due to AEs. One serious AE (increased lipase)
was related to study drug. Many of these AEs appear to be
related to underlying progressive disease.

DISCUSSION
IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a central
role in inflammation and the polarization of the immune
response. It has been shown to mediate cellular immunity
and antineoplastic effects in a variety of preclinical tumor

models,17-22 leading to its development and testing as a
potential new therapeutic agent for cancer. Phase 1 trial
testing of rhIL-18 demonstrated evidence of immunomodulatory and clinical activity over a wide range of doses
leading to the definition of a biologically active dose range
and the subsequent testing in phase 2 against melanoma,
as reported in this study.
This clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of 3 dosages
(groups of 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg/d) of rhIL-18 administered as 5 daily IV infusions repeated every 28 days. The
3 dose regimens were chosen based on the biological
865

activities observed over this dose range as defined in earlier
phase 1 studies.29 A 2-stage study design with a stopping
rule was used to allow early termination of an arm for lack
of efficacy. The primary objective was drug efficacy by tumor response rate and early termination was likely to
occur only if the true response rate was too low to be of
any clinical benefit. Sixty-four patients were accrued to
stage 1 of the study (21 [0.01 mg/kg/d], 21 [0.1 mg/kg/
d], 22 [1.0 mg/kg/d]). Among 63 subjects evaluable for
response at the end of stage 1, 1 patient (at 0.01 mg/kg)
with M1c disease achieved a partial response at the end of
cycle 4 that was maintained until the end of cycle 8. Due
to lack of efficacy by response criteria, no arm progressed
to stage II, and the study was terminated at the end of
stage I. There is, however, the possibility that rhIL-18
might be effective in stabilizing and/or improving survival. Evidence for this could be lost as a result of early closure of the study, but this decision was taken according to
the study’s original plan. Researchers have recently started
to explore the utility of OS or PFS as a benchmark for efficacy in phase 2 studies, instead of the traditional objective
tumor response rate.30 Based on a recent meta-analysis of
previously collected data from 42 melanoma phase 2 trials
conducted by SWOG, ECOG, CALGB, NCCTG, and
NCIC-CTG between 1975 and 2005, Korn et al have
suggested the use of 1-year OS or 6-month PFS as benchmarks for future phase 2 studies.31 The meta-analysis
based on 1278 patients provided an estimate of the 1-year
OS rate (25.5%) defined by 4 statistically significant independent prognostic factors that include performance status, presence of visceral metastasis, sex, and the exclusion
of patients with brain metastasis. This work provides a table of information that is relevant to the design of current
trials using a 1-year OS rate as the endpoint and gives us
predicted values based on a logistic regression analysis
according to PS, sex, presence of visceral metastasis, and
whether a trial allowed patients with brain metastasis. To
account for the immaturity of follow-up for some
patients, it is recommended to exclude patients that were
alive with less than 1 year of follow-up. In our study, the
overwhelming majority of patients are censored, and the
censoring occurred before 12 months. No patients were
followed beyond disease progression, so this analysis was
not of value, and of the other endpoint analyzed in this
review, 6-month PFS rate, was not available in this study.
In our study, the 4-months PFS rates were 20% (95% CI,
866

8.3%-48.1%) for the 0.01 mg/kg/day-dose group, 5.3%
(95% CI, 0.8%-35.5%) for the 0.1 mg/kg/day-dose
group, and 0% for the 1 mg/kg/day-dose group.
Therefore, as tested in this trial, rhIL-18 has limited
activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, and none
of the 3 doses tested here could be recommended for
phase 3 testing. However, combinations with other
immunomodulatory agents may be worthy of evaluation.
The exact dosing of rhIL-18 in combinations will likely
require phase 1 dose escalation studies in each combination, to be determined. The combined use of IL-18 and
Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG has been shown to potentiate the antitumor function of natural killer dendritic
cells (NKDC). IL-18 alone induced NKDC to secrete
IFN-gamma, and the combination of IL-18 and Toll-like
receptor 9 ligand CpG resulted in a synergistic increase in
IFN-gamma production, both in vitro and in vivo.
NKDC selectively proliferated in vitro and in vivo in
response to the combination of IL-18 and CpG. Systemic
treatment with IL-18 and CpG reduced the number of
B16F10 melanoma lung metastases.32
The combined administration of alpha-Galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) and IL-18 was shown to suppress pulmonary metastasis of experimental melanoma in
a mouse model. Alpha-GalCer shows antitumor effects by
activating NK cells indirectly through stimulation of the
secretion of cytokines by NKT cells, whereas IL-18 shows
antitumor effects by activating NK cells directly. Combined administration of alpha-GalCer and IL-18
enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK cells and increased the
number of NK cells in the lung.33
The proinflammatory role of IL-18 in inducing
CD4(þ) Type-1 T helper (Th1) immune responses essential in promoting durable antitumor immunity through
cancer vaccine strategies has been investigated and is
promising. Human dendritic cells (DCs) engineered to
secrete high levels of the IFN-gamma-inducing cytokines,
interleukin (IL)-12p70, and IL-18 by means of recombinant adenoviral infection have been reported to generate
an in vitro stimulus capable of promoting previously deficient patient Th1-type responses. Dendritic cells coinfected with Ad.IL-12 and Ad.IL-18 (DC.IL-12 of 18)
were more effective at stimulating MAGE-A6 (epitope
derived from melanoma antigens) -specific Th1-type
CD4(þ) T-cell responses than DCs infected with either
of the cytokine vectors alone, control Ad.Psi5 virus, or

uninfected DCs. The superiority of DC.IL-12 of 18based stimulation in melanoma patients was independent
of disease stage or current disease status. This agent may
prove clinically useful as a vaccine strategy to promote the
recovery of tumor antigen-specific, Th1-type CD4(þ)
T-cell responses in patients with cancer.34

CONCLUSION
Phase 1 evaluation of rhIL-18 as a single agent has demonstrated clinical antitumor activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, which has now been formally tested in
this randomized phase 2 study at 3 dose levels and shown
to be of limited clinical value. The central immunomodulatory and antitumor roles of IL-18 have repeatedly been
demonstrated, but the challenge with this agent lies in
defining how to best use its functions in more rational
combinations, clinically. Combinations with other
immunomodulatory agents, such as TLR-9 agonist CpG,
or incorporation into vaccine strategies remain of interest
and will warrant further investigation.
