Primary Systemic Chemotherapy for
Inflammatory Breast Cancer*
Sarah Sinclair, DO1 and Sandra M. Swain, MD2

The advent of multimodality therapy for patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), consisting of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, particularly taxanes, surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy, has improved survival. A pathologic
complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer and IBC improves outcomes,
which suggests that obtaining a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has prognostic significance. The benefit of high-dose chemotherapy has shown encouraging results; however, this approach needs to be
prospectively evaluated and to date remains experimental. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a promoter of angiogenesis, is highly expressed in IBC, making the angiogenesis pathway an attractive therapeutic target. A better
understanding of the complex biology of IBC is needed for the development of additional targeted agents to further

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) accounts for approximately 1% to 6% of all breast cancer cases in the United

States.1 This rare and aggressive form of breast cancer is defined clinically by the rapid development of erythema and
edema (peau d’orange) of at least 1=3 of the skin overlying the breast, often without a palpable mass.2 Lee and Tannenbaum
were the first to describe IBC in 1924 from a small series of patients at Memorial Hospital in New York.3 Plugging of the
dermal lymphatics of the breast with tumor emboli is responsible for the clinical appearance of IBC; however, this is not
mandatory for diagnosis.4 IBC is a clinical diagnosis associated with a poor prognosis. Many women present with
advanced disease at diagnosis. Certain biologic characteristics of IBC, as well as different genes, are associated with its
aggressiveness and poor outcome. In addition, IBC highly expresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic
fibroblast growth factor, both promoters of angiogenesis.5 This review will focus on systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of IBC.
Multimodality Therapy
The treatment of IBC has greatly improved with the development of multimodality therapy. Historically, surgery was the
first treatment modality for IBC; when used alone, it was not successful in achieving local control or improving survival.
Similarly, Kell and Morrow reported an average 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 4% in 293 patients with IBC treated
with mastectomy with or without radiation.6 The addition of chemotherapy followed sequentially by surgery and radiation resulted in an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) and OS for patients with this aggressive form of breast
cancer.
Currently, the standard approach to treatment of IBC per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines is neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline-based regimen with or without a taxane.7 If human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu is overexpressed, trastuzumab as part of systemic chemotherapy is indicated, but not
concomitantly with anthracyclines because of increased cardiac toxicity. The nonanthracycline regimen docetaxel,

carboplatin, trastuzumab significantly improved DFS and
OS compared with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
followed by paclitaxel in early breast cancer. Less cardiac
toxicity was also reported in the nonanthracycline arm
(docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab), compared with the
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab. Trastuzumab for a total of 1 year is
recommended. Also per NCCN guidelines, mastectomy
with axillary lymph node dissection is recommended in
IBC patients who respond to preoperative chemotherapy.
After surgery, patients should have radiation therapy, and
hormonal therapy if indicated.7
A retrospective analysis of 179 patients with nonmetastatic IBC by Perez et al showed an improvement in
both 5- and 10-year DFS in patients treated with multimodality therapy that included chemotherapy, surgery,
and radiation compared with those treated without this
approach.8 The combined modality approach yielded a 5year DFS rate of 40%, as compared with 24% for those
treated with radiation and surgery, and 6% for those
treated with radiation alone or in combination with
chemotherapy without surgery. The 10-year DFS rates
were 35%, 24%, and 0%, respectively.8
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Component of
Multimodality Treatment
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, also referred to as primary
chemotherapy or preoperative chemotherapy, has several
potential benefits in the treatment of IBC. These benefits
include down-staging of the primary tumor, which could
increase operability in some cases, and provide earlier
treatment of systemic micrometastases. The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center has treated a large
series of IBC patients with multimodality therapy. In
1997, Ueno et al reported an update on the 20-year experience of 178 patients with IBC treated on 4 different pro-

2822

spective trials at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center.9 Doxorubicin-based preoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or mastectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to all patients. The
overall response rate was 71%. The 5-year and 10-year OS
rates were 40% and 33%, respectively. An estimated 28%
of patients were reported to be alive and free of disease at
15 years. The response to preoperative chemotherapy was
the most important prognostic marker, with the highest
rates of DFS reported in those who achieved a complete
response to preoperative chemotherapy (Table 1).9
A retrospective study by Harris et al evaluated the
long-term outcome of combined modality therapy in 54
IBC patients. A clinical complete response after preoperative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil with or without preoperative
radiation was seen in 52% of patients. Mastectomy was
performed in 50 patients after preoperative therapy
(chemotherapy only, n ¼ 15; chemotherapy and radiation, n ¼ 35). Pathologic complete response to combined
chemotherapy and radiation was seen in 13 (37%)
patients. Two (12%) patients had a pathologic complete
response to preoperative chemotherapy alone. Patients
who achieved a pathologic complete response had superior 10-year survival rates compared with those in whom
residual disease was present in the breast or lymph nodes
(46% vs 31%, respectively; P ¼ .09).10 A retrospective
study in 38 women with IBC treated with CMF  vincristine, prednisone (VP) or 5-flurouracil, doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide (FAC) compared response and survival of these 2 regimens. The overall response rate to preoperative CMF  VP and FAC was 57% and 100%,
respectively. The median OS for those who received
CMF  VP was 18 months, compared with 30 months
for FAC.11

A prospective study at the National Cancer Institute
enrolled 107 patients with stage III breast cancer, of
whom 46 had IBC. Patients were treated to best response
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and
methotrexate followed by hormonal therapy, as indicated.
Median follow-up time was 16.8 years, and the overall
response rate for the 46 IBC patients was 57%. Ten- and
15-year OS rates of 26.7% and 20% were reported,
respectively. Pathologic complete response was reported
in 31 (29%) of the 107 patients.12
Anthracyclines

Primary systemic chemotherapy is an essential component of the combined-modality treatment of IBC resulting in improved survival outcomes. Anthracyclines have
been widely used for the treatment of both inflammatory
and noninflammatory breast cancer. The Early Breast
Cancer Trialists’ collaborative group reported in a 15-year
update that 6 months of adjuvant anthracycline-based
chemotherapy regimen with either FAC or FEC (FAC or
fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide; FEC or fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) reduced the annual breast cancer death rate by 38% in women diagnosed
at age <50 years and 20% in women who were diagnosed
between the ages of 50 and 69 years.13
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center series enrolled 178 IBC patients prospectively on
4 different trials. This series compared 4 anthracyclinecontaining regimens combined with locoregional therapy
that included mastectomy and/or radiation.9,14-16 There
were no significant differences in DFS or OS rates
between the 4 protocols. Median DFS for the entire group
was 21 months, and the median OS was 40 months.
Overall local control rate was 82%. Within this series, the
overall response rate, defined as complete response (CR)
þ partial response (PR), was 72%, and the CR was
12%.9,14-16 Addition of anthracyclines to primary systemic chemotherapy improved outcomes compared with
nonanthracycline-containing regimens (Table 2).
Taxanes

The addition of taxanes to systemic chemotherapy
has also been investigated in IBC patients. A retrospective
analysis of 240 patients with IBC, treated on 6 consecutive trials from 1973 to 2000, was performed to determine
the significance of adding paclitaxel to an anthracyclinebased regimen.17 One hundred seventy-eight patients
were treated with FAC alone, and 62 patients were treated
sequentially with FAC followed by paclitaxel. The objec-

tive response rates were similar in both groups: FAC
(74%) and FAC þ paclitaxel (82%). The pathologic CR
rate in the breast and axillary lymph nodes was significantly higher in those treated with paclitaxel compared
with FAC alone: 25% versus 10%, respectively. The addition of paclitaxel resulted in an improvement in median
OS and progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with
FAC alone. This was statistically significant in those
patients who had estrogen receptor-negative IBC. Median
OS was 54 months versus 32 months (P ¼ .03), respectively, and median PFS was 27 months versus 18 months
(P ¼ .04), respectively.17 The superior outcomes compared with historical controls of IBC patients treated with
anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimens have
established their use in the treatment of IBC.
Multimodality treatment of IBC is crucial to achieve
improved outcomes in this aggressive disease. A retrospective analysis was performed on 485 patients with IBC
diagnosed in British Columbia between 1980 and 2000.
The focus was to determine whether changes in chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and mastectomy improved
locoregional control or survival in women with IBC.18 By
using 5 different chemotherapy regimens, 308 patients
were treated curatively and were the study participants.
Two-hundred fifty-two patients were treated with either
FAC, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)/mitoxantrone and fluorouracil, or AC. Fifty-six patients received
either cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil (CEF),
doxorubicin and paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel, or
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide, fluorouracil, and cisplatin (Quartet). A pathologic

CR was seen in 35% of patients treated with CEF, doxorubicin and paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel, Quartetdoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide, fluorouracil, and cisplatin. There was a significantly
improved 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS)
in patients treated with CEF, doxorubicin and paclitaxel/
cisplatin and paclitaxel, and Quartet regimens compared
with patients treated with AC/mitoxantrone and fluorouracil or FAC. Ten-year BCSS and local recurrence-free
survival (LRFS) for CEF, doxorubicin and paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel, Quartet versus AC/mitoxantrone
and fluorouracil or FAC chemotherapy was 43.7% versus
23.6%, respectively (P ¼ .04) and 66.8% versus 48%,
respectively (P ¼ .03). Local control was improved with
mastectomy. The LRFS rate was 59% to 63% with mastectomy and 34% without mastectomy (P ¼ .0001).18

breast cancer (LABC) patients who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, several clinical trials that
excluded IBC patients have also reported an improved
survival in patients who achieve a pathologic CR after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathologic complete response
is, therefore, often considered to be a surrogate marker
for improved long-term prognosis. Trials that have
incorporated small numbers of IBC patients have
reported a similar survival advantage for patients who
achieved a pathologic CR; however, most of these studies
are retrospective. It is also important to mention that the
methods for assessment of a pathologic CR have not
been standardized throughout most trials. The impact
that neoadjuvant chemotherapy and pathologic CR in
IBC have on survival is unclear at this time (Table 3).

Pathologic complete response

High-dose chemotherapy

An improvement in 5-year OS and DFS was reported
by Kuerer et al in patients with locally advanced breast cancer who achieved a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.19 Hennessy et al reported that of 61
patients with IBC who had cytologically confirmed axillary
lymph node (ALN) metastases and were treated with
anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
14 patients (23%) achieved an axillary lymph node pathologic CR. Patients who had a pathologic CR in the axillary
lymph nodes had superior OS and DFS rates of 82.5% and
78.6%, compared with 37.1% and 25.4%, respectively, in
those with residual axillary disease.20 In addition, FAC þ
paclitaxel resulted in significantly more patients achieving
an ALN pathologic CR compared with those who received
FAC alone (45% vs 16%, respectively P ¼ .01).
A 2-arm randomized neoadjuvant phase 3 trial compared (arm 1) standard AC given every 3 weeks for 5
cycles followed by weekly paclitaxel to (arm 2) metronomic therapy consisting of weekly doxorubicin and daily
oral cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel in
inflammatory and locally advanced breast cancer. A total
of 372 patients were randomized, of whom only 265 were
evaluable for outcome. The preliminary results showed
that the pathologic CR rate for IBC patients was 33% in
arm 2 compared with 12% in arm 1 (P ¼ .033). The
authors suggest that metronomic therapy was more effective. However, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time,
because of the preliminary nature of the results, which
excluded 100 patients.21
In addition to the observation by Kuerer et al that
pathologic CR improved survival in locally advanced

Dose-intense neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated by Somlo et al in a retrospective analysis of 120
patients with IBC in an attempt to improve treatment
outcome.22 Patients were treated with conventional-dose
chemotherapy and surgery followed by single or tandem
cycle dose-intense chemotherapy. At a median follow-up
of 61 months, the 5-year relapse-free survival and OS
were 44% and 64%, respectively. Multivariate analysis
showed that ER/PR estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor positivity and <4 positive axillary lymph nodes were
the best predictors of which patients would benefit from
tandem dose-intense chemotherapy.
The PEGASE 02 trial was designed to evaluate the
response and toxicity of high-dose sequential chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell support as primary
chemotherapy in patients with nonmetastatic IBC.23
Ninety-five patients with nonmetastatic IBC were treated
with high dose chemotherapy (FAC) followed by blood
stem cell transplant. Mastectomy and radiotherapy were
performed after completion of primary chemotherapy.
The estimated 3-year survival was 70% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 60%-79%). The 3-year recurrence-free survival was 44% (95% CI, 33%-54%).23
A prospective study of 177 women with high-risk
primary breast cancer, which included 18 women with
IBC who were treated with high-dose primary chemotherapy, resulted in a 5-year OS rate of 36% and a 5-year DFS
rate of 28%. The benefits were seen in women who were
younger and had fewer lymph nodes involved.24 The benefit of high-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of IBC
has shown encouraging survival outcomes. This approach,

however, needs to be prospectively evaluated and remains

HER-2 targeted agents

Overexpression of HER-2 in invasive breast cancer
is associated with a high recurrence rate and reduced survival.25 An increased incidence of HER-2 overexpression
has been reported in IBC patients.26 NOAH, a phase 3
neoadjuvant trial, was designed to compare the addition
of trastuzumab with an anthracycline- and taxane-based
chemotherapy regimen to chemotherapy alone in patients
with HER-2–positive locally advanced breast cancer.
Event-free survival at 3 years was significantly improved
in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared
with chemotherapy alone (70.1% vs 53.3%; hazard ratio,
0.56; P ¼ .007).27 Recently, preliminary results of a phase
2 trial that evaluated the combination of lapatinib and
paclitaxel as neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy in IBC
patients with HER-2 overexpression showed a 77%
clinical response rate and a 17% pathologic CR rate.28
These results are consistent with those seen in non-IBC.
HER-2–targeting agents will be discussed in detail in a
subsequent review in this journal.
Biological Therapies and Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is a multistep process necessary for tumor
cell growth and metastasis. IBC highly expresses VEGF
and basic fibroblast growth factor, both of which are
angiogenic factors.5 The degree of intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) is also believed to reflect the angio-

Cancer

June 1, 2010

genic activity generated by the tumor cells and their
supportive stroma. Tumor MVD has been associated with
increased aggressiveness of breast cancer.29,30 IBC is a
highly vascular disease. Therefore, the relationship
between tumor MVD and IBC was investigated by
McCarthy et al.29 Microvessel density from 67 Tunisian
breast tumors with or without an inflammatory phenotype were determined by immunostaining intratumoral
microvessels. The median intratumoral microvessel count
was 25.5 in IBC and 6.5 in non-IBC tumors (P ¼ .009),
which suggests that IBC tumors have a significantly
increased MVD within the tumor mass.29
VEGF, a potent promoter of angiogenesis, is responsible for stimulation of endothelial cell migration,
proliferation, and survival.31 Potential mechanisms of
anti-VEGF therapies include reduction of the number of
tumor vessels and reduction of the number of circulating
endothelial and progenitor cells in the tumor, which may
reduce metastatic seeding.31-33 Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody that binds to VEGF. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E2100 evaluated the
use of bevacizumab and paclitaxel as first-line therapy in
patients with metastatic breast cancer. The combination
showed a significant improvement in PFS and overall
response rate when compared with paclitaxel alone (11 vs
6 months, respectively, P<.001; and 28% vs 14%,
respectively).34
NCI-0173, a pilot study in 21 patients with previously untreated IBC or locally advanced breast cancer,
was conducted at the National Cancer Institute.35 One

cycle of bevacizumab was administered followed by 6
cycles of bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel
given every 21 days. Eight additional cycles of bevacizumab were given after locoregional therapy with or without
hormonal therapy, as indicated. The objectives of this
study were to evaluate molecular changes in tumor of
VEGF, activated phosphorylated-VEGF receptor 2
(VEGFR2), total VEGFR2, tumor MVD, tumor cell apoptosis, and proliferation. Dynamic contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging was also used to assess vascular permeability. Clinical PR (CPR) of in 67% (14
patients), stable disease in 24% (5 patients), and progressive disease in 9% (2 patients) were seen based on imaging. One patient with a CPR had a complete pathologic
response. The overall response rate was 67% (95% CI,
43%-85.4%).35
The 67% overall response rate reported in the NCI0173 trial with IBC and LABC patients treated with neoadjuvant bevacizumab alone or with chemotherapy was
encouraging. There was a median decrease of 66.7% in
phosphorylated VEGFR2 in tumor cells (P ¼ .004) and a
median increase of 128.8% in tumor apoptosis (P ¼
.0008) after 1 cycle of bevacizumab alone, which persisted
with chemotherapy.35 This suggests that blockade of
VEGF inhibits the activation of VEGFR2 and induces the
tumor apoptosis. However, the molecular markers that
may predict response to treatment were not well understood, and therefore were investigated further in this
cohort of patients.36 The purpose of this study was to
identify biomarkers and gene expression profile signatures
to distinguish patients who respond to treatment from
those who do not. CD31, an endothelial cell adhesion
molecule, and PDGFR-b, a receptor of VEGF-A, both of
which are tumor angiogenic markers, were measured at
baseline before bevacizumab, after bevacizumab alone,
and then followed by bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.
CD31 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR)-b were shown to be significantly expressed in
patients who responded to treatment compared with
those who did not (median 33.5 vs 0.25, P ¼ .0004) and
(median 5.9 vs 0.6, P ¼ .01), respectively. Tumor VEGFA, a known target of bevacizumab, was higher at baseline
and showed a trend toward association with response to
all treatment. Other biomarkers such as MVD, ki67, p53
status, and apoptosis were not associated with response.
Of the 1339 gene ontology classes, 26 were differentially
expressed between responders and nonresponders
(P<.005). The gene ontology classes for VEGFR activity
and mitosis were significantly associated with response to

2826

bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. Those with higher tumor gene expression of VEGFA, CD31, and PDGFR-b were more likely to benefit
from treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy,
which suggests that bevacizumab may be given as a targeted agent, although this will need to be confirmed in a
larger cohort of patients.36
SU5416 (semaxanib), a small organic molecule that
inhibits VEGF-mediated signaling through the Flk-1/
KDR (VEGFR2) tyrosine kinase receptor, was combined
with doxorubicin in a phase 1B study in patients with
stage IIIB or IV IBC.37 Eighteen patients were enrolled in
this study. Neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity,
and overall median survival was not reached. Congestive
heart failure occurred in 4 (22%) patients, which prohibits further investigation of SU5416 with doxorubicin.
There was a significant decline in tumor blood flow and a
trend toward a decline in tumor microvessel density after
treatment. Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
farnesyl transferase inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy are additional targeted agents currently being
tested in IBC.38,39
A randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study comparing the combination of pazopanib and lapatinib versus
lapatinib monotherapy in patients with IBC who overexpress HER-2 is currently ongoing. There is also an openlabel pazopanib arm designed to evaluate whether pazopanib given alone and lapatinib given alone would be safe
and effective to treat patients with IBC. Pazopanib is an
oral investigational angiogenesis inhibitor that selectively
inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit, which are important
proteins involved in angiogenesis. Progression after prior
chemotherapy and trastuzumab is an eligibility requirement. The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints
include OS, overall response rate, safety, and tolerability.40 In addition, there are multiple clinical trials with
combination chemotherapy regimens for IBC that are
currently ongoing (Table 4).41
Conclusions
The application of multimodality treatment has improved
survival for patients with IBC. It is clear that the addition
of anthracyclines and taxanes to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens has improved both DFS and OS compared
with historical controls. Cristofanilli et al showed in a retrospective analysis of IBC patients that the addition of
paclitaxel to FAC improved median OS and PFS compared with FAC alone.17 Thus, the addition of taxanes to
primary systemic chemotherapy improves survival

IBC indicates inflammatory breast cancer; LABC, locally advanced breast cancer; NCT, National Clinical Trial; PBSCT, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; IL-2, interleukin-2; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;
CMF, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; HDCT, high-dose chemotherapy; ABI-007, albumin-bound
paclitaxel; FEC, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.

outcomes in IBC, and should be incorporated into the
treatment regimen. If HER-2/neu is over expressed, as per
the NCCN guidelines, the nonanthracycline regimen
docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab is indicated. Trastuzumab for a total of 1 year is recommended. HER-2–targeting agents will be discussed in detail in a subsequent
review in this journal. The NCI-0173 trial has shown that
neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination with an anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy regimen inhibited the activation of VEGFR2 and induced tumor apoptosis. The
optimal chemotherapeutic regimen, however, remains to
be defined, and further studies are needed to delineate the
particular molecular markers and genes associated with
this rare and aggressive form of breast cancer. Future trials
to evaluate targeted agents in combination with standard
therapies are necessary to further improve survival for IBC
patients.
