BACKGROUND. An open-label Phase II study of tipifarnib was conducted to evaluate its safety and efficacy in children with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma (MB)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), high-grade glioma (HGG),
and diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma (BSG).

METHODS. Between January 2004 and July 2005, patients were enrolled and stratified as follows: Stratum 1, recurrent or refractory MB/PNET; Stratum 2, recurrent
or refractory HGG; and Stratum 3, recurrent or refractory BSG. Patients received
tipifarnib 200 mg/m2 per dose twice daily for 21 days repeated every 28 days.
Patients who received enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants and other CYP3A4/5
inducers or inhibitors were excluded. The primary objective was to estimate the
sustained response rate in all strata.

espite significant progress in the treatment of children with
some central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, the prognosis
for patients with recurrent CNS malignancies after radiotherapy
remains dismal.1–6 The Ras protein is a key intermediate in the signal-transduction pathways that control growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and membrane trafficking. Ras is over activated in various
types of cancer, including astrocytoma and glioblastoma (GBM),7–10
and it has a functional role in medulloblastoma (MB) metastasis.11
The over activation of Ras may be caused by deregulation of growth

factors and growth factor receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in adult and pediatric high-grade gliomas
(HGG) and leads to activation of the Ras mitogenic
pathway.8,9,12 Taken together, these observations suggest that targeted inhibition of Ras-dependent signaling may constitute a therapeutically useful strategy
for recurrent primitive neuroectodermal tumor
(PNET) and malignant glioma.8–10
Ras is synthesized as a propeptide (pro-Ras) and
undergoes several posttranslational modifications to associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Farnesylation, the addition of a farnesyl group
to the cysteine residue on the COOH terminus, is catalyzed by the protein farnesyl transferase and is essential for Ras function.13 Although farnesyl transferase
inhibitors (FTIs) inhibit Ras farnesylation, their antiproliferative effects are not caused exclusively by the
effects on Ras, because they target other multifunctional proteins,14–18 including Rho-B,19 members of the
phosphatidylinositol 30 kinase/AKT pathway,20 and the
centromere-associated proteins CENP-E and CENP-F,21
which may mediate the antitumor effects of FTIs.
In preclinical studies, Glass et al.22 reported that
FTIs inhibit human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro at
a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) from 10 lM to
30 lM through a signal-transduction pathway that
involves the down-regulation of phosphorylated
microtubule-activated protein kinase levels, and the
cell lines that overexpressed EGFR were more sensitive
to FTIs. Feldkamp et al.23 also demonstrated that
astrocytomas were amenable to growth inhibition by
FTIs at an IC50 < 20 lM through a combination of
antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic
effects despite the lack of oncogenic ras mutations.
Tipifarnib (R115777; Zarnestra; Johnson and Johnson
Pharmaceutical Research and Development LLC,
Titusville, NJ) is an orally bioavailable methyl-quinolone, and it has been demonstrated that tipifarnib is a
potent and selective, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitor of
farnesyl protein transferase with potent activity in vitro
(IC50 < 0.1 lmol/L) and in vivo against many human
cancer cell lines and xenograft models, respectively.24
In adult Phase I trials, the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of tipifarnib was established at 300 mg
orally twice daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle with
myelosuppression as its dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT).25–27 Other toxicities included fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. In Phase II studies in hematologic malignancies, tipifarnib showed significant activity in patients with multiple myeloma28 and
myelodysplastic syndrome29 and in older adults with
poor-risk acute myelogenous leukemia.30 Generally,
the results from Phase II31–34 and III trials35,36 in

adults with solid tumors have been disappointing.
However, some clinical activity of tipifarnib as a single
agent was reported in patients with metastatic breast
cancer37 and in patients with recurrent GBM who
were not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant
drugs (EIACDs).38 Phase I trials in children with recurrent solid tumors have established the MTD at 200
mg/m2 twice daily for 21 of 28 days, and the DLTs
were myelosuppression, rash, nausea and vomiting.39
In this article, we report the results from an
open-label, Phase II trial of tipifarnib in children
with recurrent or progressive HGG (Stratum 1); MB/
PNET (Stratum 2); or diffuse, intrinsic brainstem glioma (BSG) (Stratum 3). The primary objective of this
trial was to estimate the objective response rate
(ORR) in children with recurrent or progressive HGG,
MB/PNET, and BSG. The secondary objectives were
to estimate the time to progression and the time to
death in these strata. A tertiary objective was to estimate the toxicities of tipifarnib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
The eligibility criteria were as follows: age < 22 years;
and histologically verified, recurrent or progressive
HGG, including anaplastic astrocytoma, GBM, gliosarcoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma (Stratum 1),
and MB/PNET (Stratum 2). Patients with diffuse
intrinsic BSG did not require histologic verification.
Patients were required to have measurable disease
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies; a
Lansky or Karnofsky performance status > 50%; life
expectancy 8 weeks; recovery from acute toxic
effects of prior therapy; no myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 2 weeks before study entry (4 weeks if
they received nitrosourea or temozolamide); no biologic antineoplastic agents for 7 days; no local palliative small-port radiotherapy for at least 2 weeks or
craniospinal radiotherapy for at least 3 months; no
substantial bone marrow radiation for at least
6 weeks; 1 month from autologous stem cell transplantation; and no growth factors within 1 week.
Corticosteroid therapy was permissible only for the
treatment of increased intracranial pressure and
must have been administered at a stable or decreasing dose for 1 week before study entry. The use of
EIACDs or other CYP3A4/5 inducers or inhibitors
listed in the protocol was not permissible; and the
use of cimetidine, ranitidine, and omeprazole was
permissible only in conjunction with corticosteroids
in the setting of increased intracranial pressure.
Patients had to have adequate bone marrow function, which was defined as a peripheral absolute

neutrophil count (ANC) 1000/lL; a platelet count
100,000/lL (transfusion independent); hemoglobin
8 g/dL; adequate renal function (serum creatinine
1.5 times normal for age or glomerular filtration
rate 70 mL/minute/1.73 m2); adequate liver function (total bilirubin 1.5 times the institutional
upper limit of normal for age; alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] levels
2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal for
age); adequate cardiac function (shortening fraction
27% by echocardiogram or left ventricular ejection
fraction 50% by gated radionucleotide study); adequate pulmonary function, which we defined as no
evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance,
and a pulse oximetry > 94% if there was a clinical
indication for determination; and no seizures or
well-controlled seizures on non-EIACDs. Patients
were excluded if they were receiving other anticancer
or experimental drug therapy, had allergies to azoles,
had an uncontrolled infection, or were pregnant or
breastfeeding. Informed consent was obtained from
patients, parents, or guardians; and assent was
obtained as appropriate according to institutional
guidelines. The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of participating institutions.

Drug Administration
Tipifarnib (supplied by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) was supplied in 50-mg and 100-mg
tablets and was administered orally after a meal every 12 hours for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period for a 28-day treatment cycle. Each patient’s dose
was rounded to the nearest 50 mg using a dosing
nomogram in the protocol based on body surface
area. The dose of tipifarnib was 200 mg/m2 per dose
given twice daily (400 mg/m2 per day).
Dose Modifications
If patients experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia
(<50,000/lL) or grade 4 neutropenia (<500/lL), drug
was held. Drug was resumed at the same dose when
platelets recovered to >100,000/lL or neutrophils
recovered to >1000/lL. If grade 3 thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia recurred, then the dose
was resumed at a reduced dose of 150 mg/m2 per
dose twice daily after hematologic recovery. Further
dose reductions were not permitted.
If patients experienced grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia, AST or ALT, then drug was held and was
resumed at 150 mg/m2 twice daily when the parameters had recovered to grade 1. Further dose reductions were not permitted.
If patients experienced other grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities, then tipifarnib was withheld

2537

until the toxicity had resolved to grade 1, and drug
was resumed at a dose of 150 mg/m2. Patients who
experienced grade 2 toxicity that did not resolve despite symptomatic treatment had the drug withheld.
If the toxicity resolved to grade 1 within 7 days,
then the drug was resumed at the reduced dose of
150 mg/m2 per dose twice daily. Further dose reductions were not permitted.

Pretreatment Evaluation and Evaluations During Therapy
Pretreatment evaluations included a history, physical
and opthalmologic examinations, performance status, echocardiogram, complete blood count, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, and serum
protein and albumin levels. Complete blood counts
were obtained twice weekly during the first course
and weekly thereafter. Physical examinations and
laboratory studies were obtained weekly during the
first course and before the start of each subsequent
course. Disease evaluations occurred at baseline, after Courses 2 and 4, and after every third course
thereafter. Toxicities were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
Adverse events (version 3.0). Patients had to demonstrate hematologic recovery before commencing subsequent courses of therapy with a hemoglobin level
8 g/dL, an ANC 1000/lL, and a platelet count
100,000/lL (transfusion independent).
Response Criteria
Patients had to receive 2 courses of tipifarnib to be
considered evaluable for response. Responses were
assessed by MRI. Patients must have had tumor
measurable in 3 dimensions.
A complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A partial response
(PR) was defined as a decrease 65% in the sum of
the products of the 3 greatest perpendicular dimensions of all target lesions (up to 5). Stable disease (SD)
was defined as neither a sufficient decrease in the
sum of the products of the 3 greatest perpendicular
dimensions of target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for
progressive disease (PD), which was defined as an
increase 40% in the products of the greatest perpendicular dimensions of any target lesion or the appearance of any new lesions. Responses or prolonged SD
4 courses were confirmed by central review by 2
neuroradiologists (F.L. and K.J.H.).
Several patients were taken off therapy for presumed clinical progression without obtaining confirmatory off-therapy scans, as required in the
protocol. Because the deteriorating clinical status of
many patients at the time of clinical progression

Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of the study was to estimate
the ORR after a minimum of 2 months of treatment
in patients with HGG, MB, and BSG. A Simon optimal 2-stage design40 was used to test the null hypothesis that the response rate was 5% (vs 25%)
with an a level of .05 and 90% power.41 Fifteen evaluable patients were to be enrolled on the first stage of
each stratum. If at least 1 patient had a confirmed
objective response (CR 1 PR), then an additional
15 patients would be enrolled.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 97
patients who were enrolled on this study. The median
age was 11.2 years (range, 3.2–21.9 years). The median
number of courses of tipifarnib administered was 2

(range, 1–25 courses). All 97 patients were eligible. Sixteen patients were not evaluable for response and did
not complete the first 2 courses of therapy because
they did not receive the correct medication dose
(n 5 5 patients), died 5 days into therapy (n 5 1
patient), were receiving contraindicated medications
(n 5 2 patients), were taken off therapy at parents’
request (n 5 2 patients) or at the discretion of the
physician (n 5 1 patient), were treated concurrently
with other anticancer agent (imatinib mesylate; n 5 1
patient), or did not undergo off-therapy scan evaluations to confirm PD and died > 2 weeks after cessation of therapy (n 5 4 patients).

Toxicity
Table 2 summarizes the number and percentage of
patients who experienced various treatment-related

Tipifarnib in Pediatric CNS Malignancies/Fouladi et al.

toxicities. In general, tipifarnib appeared to be tolerated well. The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse
events included neutropenia (18.7%), thrombocytopenia (14.3%), leucopenia (14.3%), and diarrhea and
vomiting (4.4%). Six patients were not evaluable for
toxicity because they were assigned mistakenly to
receive a dose that was too high (n 5 3 patients) or
because they received a concomitant contraindicated
medication during therapy (n 5 3 patients).

Response to Therapy
Among the 31 evaluable patients with recurrent or
progressive HGG, 1 patient had a confirmed PR, and
3 patients continued on therapy for at least 4 cycles
(10%). Among the 35 patients with BSG, 1 patient
had confirmed PR, and 4 patients continued on therapy with SD for 4 cycles (11%). Among the 15
patients with MB/PNET, no objective response was
observed, and only 1 patient received therapy for at
least 4 cycles (7%).

DISCUSSION
The role of chemotherapy in children with HGG and
BSG remains limited, and there is no standard chemotherapy regimen that offers a clear survival advantage.41 In patients with MB/PNET, standard frontline
therapy currently includes adjuvant, platinum-based
chemotherapy.42–45 However, cisplatin-related toxicities (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity) and carboplatinrelated toxicities (myelosuppression) have remained
significant problems. Thus, the development of novel
treatment strategies to improve survival and minimize sequelae in patients with MB/PNET, HGG, and
BSG is a major objective in pediatric neuro-oncology.
Although malignant astrocytomas and MBs do
not harbor oncogenic ras mutations, it has been
established that Ras is over activated in astrocytomas
and GBMs,8–10,12 as well as MBs because of overexpression and/or deregulation of upstream growth
factors and their receptors, such as EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Thus, FTIs represent a novel treatment strategy for patients with
these malignancies.
The current study demonstrated that tipifarnib
administered orally at 200 mg/m2 per dose twice
daily for 21 days every 28 days was tolerated well in
children but had little activity as a single agent in
children with recurrent CNS malignancies; 1 patient
with BSG (2.9%) and 1 patient with HGG (3.2%) had
a PR, and 17 patients remained on therapy for > 4
courses. A similar Phase II trial of tipifarnib in adults
with recurrent GBM demonstrated slightly better but
still modest activity in patients who did not receive

2539

EIACDs, and 4 patients (11%) experienced a PR.38
The slightly better ORR observed in adult studies
among patients with GBM may be related to differences between the biology of high-grade gliomas in
children and adults.46,47 Amplification of the EGFR
gene, which may lead to activation of the Ras mitogenic pathway, was observed in 30% to 40% of adult
HGG but is rare in children.46,48,49 Furthermore, in
adults, EGFR overexpression and amplification go
hand-in-hand; whereas, despite the finding that 85%
of pediatric HGG overexpress EGFR, EGFR amplification was observed only in approximately 7% of
patients.39,50,51 Thus, different mechanism may be responsible for EGFR overexpression in childhood
high-grade gliomas compared with adults.
Overall, our data on the use of single-agent tipifarnib are similar to those from reports of Phase II
and III trials among adults with solid tumors—results
that generally have been disappointing.31–36 In contrast, data on patients with hematologic malignancies have been more encouraging.28–30
Similar to what has been observed in most previously published studies, the main toxicity of tipifarnib reported was myelosuppression. In the adult
Phase II trial in patients with recurrent malignant
gliomas, rash was reported as the DLT in patients
who received EIACDs, and myelosuppression was the
DLT in the group that did not receive EIACDs. However, the incidence and severity of rash in both
groups were similar.38 One patient experienced grade
4 skin ulceration in the current study with no other
reported grade 3 or 4 rashes. It is noteworthy that we
excluded patients who were on EIACDs, because tipifarnib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and
would be anticipated to have an increased clearance
in the presence of EIACDs. In fact, Cloughesy et al.
confirmed this assumption by demonstrating a clear
difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters
between the 2 groups, with an area under the plasma
concentration time curve that was 2-fold lower for
patients who were on EIACDS.38 Similarly, SiegelLakhai et al. reported that, in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function, tipifarnib led to significant grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity and could
not be administered safely.52
In summary, in this Phase II pediatric trial, tipifarnib was tolerated relatively well but demonstrated
minimal single-agent antitumor activity in children
with recurrent CNS malignancies. Efforts should
focus on determining whether combination treatment with tipifarnib and other cytotoxic or molecularly targeted therapies (eg, epidermal growth factor
inhibitors) may be of potential benefit in patients
with CNS malignancies. Currently, based on preclini-
