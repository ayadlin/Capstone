Abstract:
Activating oncogenic mutations of BRAF have been described in patients with
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but treatment of GIST with BRAF inhibitors
and mechanisms of mediating the emergence of resistance in GIST have not been
reported. Dabrafenib is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of BRAF kinase and is
highly selective for mutant BRAF in kinase panel screening, cell lines, and xenografts.
We report prolonged antitumor activity in the first patient with V600E BRAF-mutated
GIST who was treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Whole exome sequencing performed
in tumor tissue obtained at the time of progressive disease demonstrated a somatic
gain-of-function PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) as well as a CDKN2A aberration, which
may have contributed to eventual resistance to treatment.

INTRODUCTION

mutant melanoma, as well as improvement in overall
survival and progression-free survival[9-11]. Recently,
we have shown that the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib
(GSK2118436) is also active in several non-melanoma
BRAF-mutated cancers[10].
Herein, we report antitumor activity in the first
patient with BRAF-mutated GIST who was treated with
a BRAF inhibitor. Whole exome sequencing of tumor
obtained at time of progressive disease did not reveal
secondary BRAF or RAS mutations, but did demonstrate
a somatic gain-of-function PIK3CA mutation (H1047R)
as well as a CDKN2A aberration, which may have been
responsible for dabrafenib resistance.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a
malignancy of mesenchymal origin that arises in the
gastrointestinal tract and is resistant to conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy agents[1]. KIT and plateletderived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) mutations
are present in 80% and 8% of GISTs, respectively[2-4].
Approximately 13% of KIT and PDGFRA wild-type
GISTs contain BRAF mutations[5]. Although receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib or sunitinib,
are therapeutically active antagonists of KIT and PDGFRA
in KIT- or PDGFRA-mutated GIST[6-8], effective
treatments for patients with advanced BRAF-mutant GIST
have not been reported.
Clinical trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that
are highly selective for V600 BRAF mutations have
demonstrated high response rates (50-80%) in BRAFwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tomography (CT) revealed a 10 cm heterogeneous
mass, and a subsequent biopsy demonstrated GIST,
spindled cell histology, positive for CD34 and CD117
by immunohistochemistry with 6 mitoses per 10
high-powered fields. The patient underwent surgical
resection revealing a 15 cm mass. DNA was extracted
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplifications of KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 as well as
PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. Sanger sequencing did not
identify mutations in either the KIT or PDGFRA genes.
The patient presented with a new 14 cm mass at the dome
of the bladder after 10 months of adjuvant imatinib therapy
(400 mg once daily). The imatinib dose was increased to
800 mg daily, followed by surgical resection of the mass.
The patient received adjuvant sunitinib, a multiple tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, at a dose of 50 mg on a schedule of once
daily for four weeks, then off for two weeks. Nineteen
months later, a PET/CT showed recurrent FDG-avid
masses in the right internal iliac region and in the right
abdomen extending into the rectus abdominis.
The patient enrolled on a clinical trial with an
investigational KIT/PDGFRA/VEGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, but disease progression was noted at his first
restaging (two months of treatment). Further testing of the
patient’s original tumor revealed a V600E BRAF mutation.
The patient was then treated with an investigational MEK
inhibitor for three months, during which the tumor initially
remained stable but was subsequently found to have
enlarged and remained enhancing by CT imaging.
The patient was treated on a phase I trial of
dabrafenib at a dose of 150 mg twice daily[10]. The
patient’s baseline CT scan demonstrated multiple
metastases in the lower abdomen and pelvis, with the
largest tumors including a 6.3 cm mass posterior to the

bladder and a 6.3 cm mass in the anterior pelvis (Figure
1, Panel A). Using the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0, restaging scans revealed a
14%, 18% and 20% decrease after 6, 15 and 24 weeks of
treatment, respectively. Figure 1 Panel B demonstrates
response on CT scan at 24 weeks. In addition, the tumor
demonstrated a marked decrease in contrast enhancement,
a response criteria that has been validated in GIST[12].
The patient remained on study for 8 months, after
which tumor progression was noted by contrast-enhanced
CT imaging. The only treatment-related adverse events
were grade 2 rash and acrochrodons (skin tags), as well as
grade 1 fatigue and hyperkeratosis of the plantar surface
of the feet. After tumor progression was identified, the
patient underwent surgical resection of all visible tumors
in the abdomen and pelvis. Tissue from this resection was
evaluated with whole exome sequencing.
To fully account for intratumor heterogeneity,
which can be a factor in tumor adaptation and treatment
failure[13], three lesions were analyzed by whole
exome sequencing (Figure 2). All three lesions were
clonally related as evidenced by identical BRAF V600E
mutations, identical CDKN2A IVS1+1 G>A mutations,
and fifteen other shared somatic single nucleotide
variations. One of the three lesions (lesion 1), had a
somatic gain-of-function PIK3CA mutation (H1047R),
that has previously been reported in other human
cancers[14]. Figure 3 demonstrates the PIK3CA H1047R
mutation in lesion 1 (Panel A), in contrast to wild type
PIK3CA in lesion 2 (Panel B), lesion 3 (Panel C), and
normal tissue (Panel D). Lesions 2 and 3 appeared to
be clonally related as they shared two mutations that
were not present in lesion 1. Although all three lesions
had a common CDKN2A mutation, lesions 1 and 3 were
heterozygous for this mutation whereas lesion 2 was

homozygous. This splice site mutation has been described
previously as a somatic variant in melanoma[15] and
glioma[16].

DISCUSSION
BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated antitumor
activity in clinical trials of patients with BRAF mutant
malignancies[9-11]. We report prolonged antitumor
activity in the first patient with a BRAF-mutated GIST
who was treated with a BRAF inhibitor.
Activating oncogenic mutations of BRAF have been
described in many malignancies, including cutaneous
melanoma (67%), colorectal carcinoma (12%), non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC; 3%), and KIT wild-type
GIST (13%)[5,17]. The most common BRAF mutation is
a substitution of valine with glutamic acid at amino acid
position 600 (V600E), which locks BRAF into its active
conformation, resulting in a ten-fold increase in activity
over wild-type BRAF[17].
Dabrafenib is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of
BRAF kinase and is highly selective for mutant BRAF
in kinase panel screening, cell lines, and xenografts[18].
Dabrafenib has demonstrated antitumor activity in several
BRAF-mutated malignancies including melanoma,
colorectal carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma,
NSCLC, and ovarian carcinoma[10].
Kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF have the potential
to be an effective therapeutic option for BRAF-mutant
GIST patients[10]. The present case demonstrates proof
of principle for BRAF inhibition as a therapeutic strategy
for GIST patients. Tumor regression was not seen when
this patient was given a multi-kinase inhibitor that did not
target BRAF, or a MEK inhibitor. However, it should be
noted that both of these agents were experimental, and
therefore their therapeutic value has not yet been fully
validated. Treatment with dabrafenib, which targets
BRAF directly, resulted in tumor regression after 6 weeks,
and continued decreasing in size until week 24, followed
by a plateau and then progression at 8 months.
Whole exome sequencing did not reveal secondary
BRAF or RAS mutations but did demonstrate a somatic
gain-of-function PIK3CA mutation (H1047R), that has
previously been reported in other human cancers[14].
We speculate that the PIK3CA mutation could be the
cause of the acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance in lesion
1. This finding is notable, because to the best of our
knowledge this is only the second PIK3CA mutation ever
reported in GIST[19]. Furthermore, although PIK3CA
mutations have not previously been reported as a cause
of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma
or other malignancies, low PTEN expression and other
PTEN alterations are associated with lower response rate
and shorter progression-free survival in BRAF mutant
melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors[20,21].
We further speculate that dysregulation of cell cycle

MATERIALS AND METHODS

control by the homozygous CDKN2A mutation in lesion
2 may also be a molecular basis for resistance of this
lesion. No obvious explanation for resistance to BRAF
inhibitor treatment was seen in lesion 3. We further tested
RNA from all three lesions and were unable to detect
aberrant BRAF splicing as a basis for drug resistance[22].
The differences in sequencing among the three lesions
highlight the prevalence of intratumor heterogeneity and
the potential relevance to treatment outcomes[13].
In conclusion, we present the first patient with
GIST and a V600E BRAF mutation whose tumor showed
regression while receiving treatment with a BRAF
inhibitor. To our knowledge, the efficacy of BRAF
inhibitors in BRAF-mutant GIST has not been reported,
but our case suggests that additional studies and perhaps a
global clinical trial are warranted.

Whole exome capture was performed with a
SeqCap EZ Human Exome v2.0 kit (Roche NimbleGen,
Madison, WI), and sequencing was carried out on a
HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA).
Sequence alignment and variant calling were performed
with DNAnexus software (DNAnexus Inc, Mountain
View, CA). Tumor-specific variants were identified based
on a minimum variant allele ratio of 20%, a minimum
read depth of 20, and absence of the variant in a matched
normal specimen. Nucleotide variants were translated, and
non-synonymous variants were identified using SIFT[23],
PolyPhen2[24], and Mutation Assessor[25]. Variants of
interest were confirmed by Sanger sequence analysis.

tissue (d) were wild type for PIK3CA.
