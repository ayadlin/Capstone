ABSTRACT
ABCG2 is responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype,
and strongly modulates cancer outcomes. Its high expression at a number of
physiological barriers, including blood-brain and intestinal barriers, impacts on
drug pharmacokinetics parameters. We characterized MBL-II-141, a specific
and potent ABCG2 inhibitor. Combination of 10 mg/kg MBL-II-141 with the
anticancer agent CPT-11 completely blocked the growth of 90% freshly implanted
ABCG2-positive tumors. Moreover, the same combination slowed the growth
of already established tumors. As required for preclinical development, we
defined the main pharmacokinetics parameters of MBL-II-141 and its influence
on the kinetics of CPT-11 and its active metabolite SN-38 in mice. MBL-II-141
distribution into the brain occurred at a low, but detectable, level. Interestingly,
preliminary data suggested that MBL-II-141 is well tolerated (at 50  mg/kg)
and absorbed upon force-feeding. MBL-II-141 induced a potent sensitization of
ABCG2-positive xenografts to CPT-11 through in vivo ABCG2 inhibition. MBL-II-141
strongly increased CPT-11 levels in the brain, and therefore would be a valuable
agent to improve drug distribution into the brain to efficiently treat aggressive
gliomas. Safety and other pharmacological data strongly support the reglementary
preclinical development of MBL-II-141.

(BCRP/MXR/ABCG2), are overexpressed and
widely contribute to the multidrug resistance (MDR)
phenotype. The latter is also associated with a lower
survival of cancer patients [1–4]. ABCG2 expression
provides an early prediction of the clinical outcome
of cancers, which can be used to improve the clinical
management of gastric cancer patients [5]. Interestingly,
expression levels of ABCG2 have been described as an
important determinant of the “side-population” (SP)

phenotype, characteristic of stem cells (as a Hoechst
33342-negatively stained population compared to
the majority of cells) [6]. ABCG2-positive cells
from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), displayed
enhancements in tumorigenicity, proliferation capacity,
doxorubicin resistance, cell migration, and invasion
potential, whereas ABCG2 down-expression by siRNA
significantly blocked these malignant properties [7].
Consequently, anticancer therapy could eliminate the
majority of tumor cells, generate clonal selection of
aggressive tumor cells overexpressing ABCG2 and
cause their relapse. In conclusion, this suggests that
the ABCG2 protein is an appealing therapeutic target,
and inhibiting its mediated secretion or decreasing its
expression level in cancer cells constitute potential
strategies to overcome chemoresistance.
ABCG2 is responsible for the secretion of a
large range of molecules, including anticancer agents
such as mitoxantrone [8], topotecan, irinotecan and its
SN-38 active metabolite [9, 10]. In vitro experiments
showed that, by decreasing the intracellular retention
of anticancer agents, ABCG2 drastically reduces drug
cytotoxicity. In addition, since it is strongly expressed in
polarized cells within physiological barriers, including
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [11], hepatocytes [12] and
enterocytes [13], it also limits drug distribution within
the body. ABCG2 is also expressed in the breast [14]
and the kidney [12]. It is well recognized to influence
the pharmacokinetics parameters of substrates such
as topotecan [15], camptothecin [16], methotrexate
(in combination with ABCC2 and ABCC3) [17],
tandutinib [18], and erlotinib [19]. In consequence,
inhibition of ABCG2 may strongly improve distribution
of its substrates into the brain [20] and thus modulate
brain tumor treatment. Recently, Kawamura et al.
showed the role of ABCG2 and ABCB1 on CPT-11
(irinotecan) distribution inside mouse brain [21]
which could be harnessed to improve efficiency of
aggressive gliomas treatment. Strongly expressed
at the physiological barriers, ABCG2 could also
decrease plasma levels of anticancer drugs that are
rapidly metabolized and excreted without reaching
pharmacological concentration levels.
Whilst initial clinical assays were often discordant
and not fully convincing, targeting ABC proteins with
modulators remains a possible approach to improve
chemotherapy efficiency. Chemosensitization strategies
targeting ABCB1 have been so far unsuccessful due to
low numbers of candidate inhibitors and unsuitable trials
[22]. Inhibitors still need to be improved by increasing
substrate specificity and lowering toxicity. Moreover,
they should not show any adverse effect on drug
pharmacokinetics that could lead to toxic plasma levels of
anticancer drugs. The neurotoxic fumitremorgin C (FTC)
was the first selective ABCG2 inhibitor identified [23].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Later, synthetic analogs of FTC were studied, including
Ko143 which was devoid of toxicity and increased the oral
availability of topotecan, giving plasma levels 4 to 6-fold
higher in ABCB1(-/-) mice [24]. In vitro, other ABCG2specific modulators were developed from the structure of
the ABCB1 inhibitor tariquidar [25], although their in vivo
efficiency over ABCG2-mediated chemoresistance has
not been yet reported. Very recently, telatinib (15 mg/kg)
in combination with doxorubicin (1.8 mg/kg) was shown
to significantly decrease the growth rate and tumor
size of ABCG2-overexpressing tumors in a xenografted
nude mouse model [26]. In order to specifically
study the impact of ABCG2 modulation on substrate
pharmacokinetics and reversion of MDR phenotype,
we designed an ABCG2-selective inhibitor (MBL-I-87)
using the structure of the ABCB1 inhibitor elacridar
as a template. It proved to be an efficient inhibitor of
ABCG2 excretion [27] which improved in vivo CPT-11
anticancer activity on the growth of ABCG2-positive
xenografted tumors [28, 29]. We also developed an
inhibition model of tumor growth [30] predicting
tumor growth dynamics, to be used as a template to
design studies for producing more efficient ABCG2
inhibitors. Indeed, our team recently screened
an original chemical library to identify more powerful
inhibitors, some being devoid of toxicity. Using
a chromone core instead of the acridone moiety,
we identified a highly promising candidate for in vivo
studies: MBL-II-141 or 5-(4-bromobenzyloxy)-2(2-(5-methoxyindolyl) ethyl-1-carbonyl)-4H-chromen4-one, also called chromone 6g [31]. MBL-II-141
displayed a high-affinity inhibition activity (IC50 of
0.11 μM) and a very low cytotoxicity (IG50 > 100 µM).
It was shown to inhibit ABCG2 in various cell lines,
either. Transfected with expression vector of ABCG2
or selected with mitoxantrone [32] and was found
to be the most powerful modulator yet described.
Similarly to other ABCG2-selective inhibitors such
as acridones [27] and methoxy trans-stilbenes [33],
MBL-II-141 inhibition is non-competitive towards
mitoxantrone [31]. It is able to strongly inhibit
the efflux of all tested substrates including
mitoxantrone and SN-38 [31], pheophorbide
A and BODIPY-prazosin [32]. Its remarkable high
therapeutic index (> 900) completely justified its in
vivo evaluation aimed at chemosensitizing ABCG2positive tumors. In this study, we established a
protocol of pharmacological treatment (i.e. dose
and route of administration) based on the prediction
model developed with MBL-I-87 [29] to evaluate
the efficacy of MBL-II-141 against tumor growth.
Furthermore, we looked at its tolerance in mice and
we found that its pharmacokinetic parameters met
the preliminary requirements for further clinical drug
development.

the effects of the same combination on established
tumors (Figure 2). We delayed the pharmacological
treatment until tumors reached 8 mm in diameter (mean
volume of 238 mm3); this represented well-established
tumors, fully developed and undergoing exponential
growth. Treatments with MBL-II-141 alone had a
negligible effect on tumor growth (Figure 2A), with
a slope of 68 ± 3 mm3/day versus 61 ± 3 mm3/day
for tumors treated with solvents. CPT-11 alone was
able to delay the tumor growth, with a slope of 50
± 2 mm3/day, but did not markedly improve mice
survival (Figure 2B). Only the drug combination was
able to greatly lower tumor growth, with a slope of
41 ± 1 mm3/day, and the tumors reached their maximal
size about two weeks later than those treated with CPT-11
alone (Figure 2A). Consequently, the combination
markedly increased mice survival (Figure 2B and
Supplementary table 2).

MBL-II-141 in vivo sensitizes ABCG2-positive
xenografts to CPT-11 treatment
In vitro studies previously demonstrated the
valuable inhibitory effect of MBL-II-141 on ABCG2
drug-efflux activity. This compound was found to be
a powerful and highly-specific inhibitor of ABCG2,
blocking mitoxantrone efflux with an IC50 of 0.11 μM,
without any effect on ABCC1-mediated transport
using either mitoxantrone or calcein as substrates [31].
Furthermore, little effect on viability was observed in
vitro, with less than 25% cell death of HEK293 cells at
100 µM; therefore, MBL-II-141 displayed a low
cytotoxicity and appeared to be a promising molecule
for in vivo assays of ABCG2 inhibition.
Firstly, we evaluated MBL-II-141 efficacy to
chemosensitize ABCG2-positive, freshly established,
tumors to CPT-11 treatment. Following the onset
of tumors growing from HEK293-ABCG2 cells or
control HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells (implanted into
the flank of SCID mice), the animals were treated by
CPT-11, either alone or in combination with MBLII-141. All xenografts grew rapidly in the presence of
the vehicles (corn oil/5% DMSO and PBS) (Figure 1),
while MBL-II-141 displayed a slight inhibitory effect
on the growth of ABCG2-negative tumors (Figure 1A
and Supplementary table 1). This effect was not
observed for ABCG2-positive tumors (Figure 1B),
and was not related to an enhanced cytotoxicity of
MBL-II-141 on HEK293-pcDNA3.1 control cells. On
the contrary, it was found to be slightly more cytotoxic
in vitro on HEK293-ABCG2 cells than on HEK293pcDNA3.1 cells (leading to 60% and 75% cell survival,
respectively, at 100 µM) [31].
The CPT-11 treatment completely blocked
the growth of ABCG2-negative cells, whereas it
only delayed, by about two months, the growth of
ABCG2-positive tumors. Interestingly, co-treatment
of CPT-11 with MBL-II-141 was able to completely
block the growth of 90% ABCG2-positive tumors.
In terms of animal survival (Figure 1A), CPT-11
alone was sufficient to ensure the survival of 100%
of mice bearing ABCG2-negative tumors. It also
increased the survival of mice bearing ABCG2-positive
tumors, although these mice had to be sacrificed at
day 110 (Figure 1B) as the tumor size reached the
maximal size authorized by the ethical code. The
combination of MBL-II-141 and CPT-11 remarkably
increased the survival rate of mice, up to 90%, even
after 40 days following the end of the treatment
(Figure 1B).
Since the combination efficiently prevented the
growth of early ABCG2-positive tumors, we then tested

MBL-II-141 modifies CPT-11 and
SN-38 pharmacokinetics
From the perspective of putative pharmaceutical
development, we fully analyzed the kinetics
parameters of MBL-II-141 in SCID mice (Figure 3
and Supplementary table 3). The highest level of
MBL-II-141 in total blood was observed at 0.5 h
(Figure 3A). The levels then rapidly decreased to below
the detection limit at 6 h. The elimination profile was
similar in either the presence or absence of CPT-11
after 1 h. MBL-II-141 distribution into the brain
was at a low, but still detectable, level (Figure 3C).
CPT-11 appeared to decrease the MBL-II-141
distribution into the brain until 4 h, then MBL-II-141
levels became similar in either absence or presence of
CPT-11.
While the CPT-11 injected dose was 2-fold
higher than MBL-II-141 (20 versus 10 mg/kg), the
CPT-11 blood levels were relatively much higher
(Figure 3A), and the levels were globally 10-fold higher
than those of MBL-II-141 at the same time points. 90%
of CPT-11 was lost from the blood at 4 h. CPT-11 levels
also rapidly decreased in the liver (Figure 3B). A very
weak distribution was observed into the brain, with
a value 200-fold lower than in the liver. However,
the CPT-11 brain levels were significantly and
durably increased in the presence of MBL-II-141
(Figure 3C), by approximately 2-fold (Supplementary
table 4), whereas no impact was observed on the liver levels.
In parallel, we also quantified the levels of SN-38
in blood and tissues, which acts as both the CPT-11 active
metabolite and an ABCG2 substrate. It was detected in
blood until 6 h (Figure 3A), and the median level greatly
decreased after 2 h. In the presence of MBL-II-141,
SN-38 kinetics displayed a similar profile (with an

increase of blood level at 1 h) but, interestingly,
MBL-II-141 increased the SN-38 blood levels.
This effect disappeared after 8 h, when levels became
almost undetectable. In the liver, SN-38 followed
a similar profile as in the blood, but the increase
observed in the presence of MBL-II-141 was barely
significant (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 3),
while SN-38 levels in the brain were below the limits of
quantification (Figure 3C).

lower at 4 h under force-feeding in comparison to an
intraperitoneal (IP) route (Figure 4C). Nevertheless, the
observed difference was not significant due to the high
variability of blood levels.

MBL-II-141 is predicted to be a highly
tolerated molecule
In view of the requirements of this new drug for
pharmaceutical development, we investigated in silico
safety data by using the Percepta software. By comparing
in vitro experimental data from structurally-related
molecules, it was possible to predict its oral absorption,
tissue distribution, genotoxicity and cancerogenicity
(Table 1). Percepta predictions indicated only a weak
acute toxicity of MBL-II-141. In mice, the predicted
LD50 was 290, 1200, 77 or 320 mg/kg, respectively,
by IP, oral, intravenous or sub-cutaneous route. Similar
data were predicted for rats, which are frequently used in
preclinical studies (Table 1). In our pilot study, no acute
toxicity was experimentally observed at 10 mg/kg per
mouse. Furthermore, reiterated administrations confirmed

MBL-II-141 is accumulated at low levels
and is orally absorbed
As previously observed, MBL-II-141 was rapidly
eliminated from blood after a single injection. To study
a possible accumulation effect, we quantified blood
levels of MBL-II-141 at 1 or 4 h after the last injection
in a multiple-administration protocol. MBL-II-141
blood levels were similar after one or two injection(s)
(Figure 4A), while the third injection led to a slight
increase of blood level, regardless of the time of blood
collection (Figure 4A). In addition, we evaluated
whether this molecule was orally absorbed upon

(at 10 mg/kg) or in combination with 20 mg/kg of CPT-11 was intraperitoneally administered to SCID mice. Blood, brain and liver were
taken for LC-MS/MS analysis after 30, 60, 120, 240 or 360 min for treatments with MBL-II-141 alone, and after 30, 60, 120, 240 or 480

However, safety requirements of such a silencing system
in clinical applications are complicated and under
development. Thus, research of chemical molecules is
still a valuable strategy. Our present study concerns the
inhibitory effect of MBL-II-141 on ABCG2-mediated
drug resistance to CPT-11. As expected, CPT-11 alone
blocked the growth of ABCG2-negative xenografts, but
only delayed the growth of ABCG2-positive xenografts.

ABCG2-positive tumors, but also to strongly slow
down the growth of already established tumors. ABCG2
inhibition by MBL-II-141 in ABCG2-positive xenografts
therefore plays a significant and synergistic role with CPT-11
anticancer activity. With an IC50 of 0.11 μM, MBL-II-141
is known as one of the most powerful inhibitors ever
described for ABCG2 (Table 2) [31, 32]. Its elevated
IG50 (50% of cell growth inhibition), > 100 µM, leads
to a high in vitro therapeutic ratio [31], and is consistent
with low toxicity for mice in a repeated-administration
protocol (with 10 mg/kg MBL-II-141 in combination
with 20 mg/kg CPT-11 for more than 100 days).
Several ABCG2 inhibitors have been tested in vivo

(Table 2): some of them, such as GF120918 [35],
Telatinib [26], Sorafenib [36] and YHO-13177 [37],
have been described to delay the growth of small
tumors in combination with doxorubicin or CPT-11.
However, MBL-II-141 is clearly shown here to be the
most effective, by completely inhibiting the growth
of 90% tumors. In addition, its in vivo efficiency was
validated at a relatively low dose (10 mg/kg), which
also suggests a high inhibition activity in animal
models. Moreover, MBL-II-141 is the first ABCG2
inhibitor ever described to significantly delay the growth
of well-established tumors. Together with YHO-13177
[37] and Ko143 [24], MBL-II-141 is one of the very few
ABCG2-specific inhibitors assayed in animal models.

and the complete disappearance of 90% tumors observed
in the present study.
In light of ABCG2-positive tumor sensitization
and as required by preclinical development, we
decided to define the pharmacokinetics parameters of
MBL-II-141 and its possible interactions on CPT11
and SN-38 pharmacokinetics. The ABCG2 transporter
plays a key role in protecting the brain parenchyma
by catalyzing the efflux of xenobiotics from capillary
endothelial cells at the BBB. It largely prevents the entry
of its anticancer substrates at the BBB, thereby limiting
their efficacy [20, 38]. In addition, Kawamura et al. (2013)
recently demonstrated that ABCG2 strongly decreased
CPT-11 distribution into the brain [21] by using labeled
[11C]-CPT-11 to specifically track CPT-11, even in the
presence of its SN-38 active metabolite. In complete
agreement with these data, and despite high blood levels,
we also found that CPT-11 displayed an apparently low
distribution into the brain. However, similarly to GF120918
(5 mg/kg) [21], MBL-II-141 significantly increased CPT11 levels into the brain. The SN-38 blood levels were
strongly increased by MBL-II-141, but remained under
the limit of detection into the brain. In comparison with
Lin’s work with normal FVB mice, intravenous injection
of CPT-11 led to lower plasma levels than those observed
here for our immunodeficient SCID mice. In contrast, the
brain levels were higher in these normal strain mice, and
SN-38 was consequently detectable [16]. In ICR mice,
Yamazaki et al. described SN-38 plasma levels 27-fold
lower than CPT-11, 1 h after the injection, [37] which is
consistent with our difference of 19-fold between CPT-11
and SN-38 levels. Taken altogether, the results show a lower
brain distribution in our mouse strain; nevertheless, CPT11 distribution is increased and can be locally metabolized
to SN-38 [39] by brain carboxylesterases [40]. The results
suggested that MBL-II-141 positively influences SN-38
distribution into the brain and tumors, increasing its
antitumor effect. Nevertheless, from the perspective of
clinical use, the distribution of SN-38 has to be completed
by evaluating the possible SN-38 accumulation in blood
after reiterated administration of CPT-11 in combination
with MBL-II-141. Our preliminary data did not show any
significant change in SN-38 blood level after a 2 h treatment
with CPT-11 and MBL-II-141 whether the animals were
submitted to an acute or a chronic treatment (Supplementary
figure 2). Furthermore, no side effects (loss of weight,
modification of blood count) were observed during the
several months of combination treatments.
Consequently, MBL-II-141 would be useful to
increase the distribution of CPT-11 into the brain and,
potentially, to locally treat gliomas since CPT-11 has
proved its antitumor activity against MDR glioblastoma
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells [41]. This potential clinical development is also
well supported by the fact that ABCG2 function at
the BBE is relatively higher in human than in mouse.
CPT-11 distribution may clearly be improved in the
presence of MBL-II-141 in aggressive gliomas treatments.
This is further supported by recent data showing that
irinotecan in combination with temozolomide and
bevacizumab produced promising results [41].
From the perspective of a putative pharmaceutical
development, our preliminary data indicate that
MBL-II-141 is absorbed after force-feeding to a lesser
extent than through the IP route. MBL-II-141 bioavailability
was predicted to be around 9% (Table 1), consistent with
our data after force-feeding. As likely due to its high
hydrophobicity, MBL-II-141 was predicted to strongly
bind to human serum albumin (HSA) in blood, suggesting
a low unbound active fraction in plasma. Even though
reglementary guidelines generally do not require such
knowledge in cancer use (for treating aggressive tumors with
a low survival rate), the Percepta software predicted that
MBL-II-141 is not genotoxic and not carcinogenic.
In agreement with data from our pilot experiments,
MBL-II-141 displays a low toxicity level during both
acute and repeated-administration protocols. Nevertheless,
several injections in a short period of time increased CPT11 blood level. Indeed, two injections separated by 4 h did
not change the blood level, while the third injection led to a
slight increase. This may be due to an accumulative effect
in the peritoneal cavity, due to the high hydrophobicity, and
possible precipitation, of MBL-II-141. This last hypothesis
was supported by the fact that, at 50 mg/kg for 3 times a
week for 1 month, a slight deposit in the peritoneal cavity
was observed (data not shown). Furthermore, no sign of
toxicity (such as decrease of weight and modification of
behavior) has ever been observed.
To conclude, by inhibiting the in vivo transport
activity of ABCG2, MBL-II-141 has proved its efficiency
of chemosensitization in xenograft models, and is
therefore of interest for improving drug distribution into
the brain. All observations and prediction data suggest a
high mouse tolerance to MBL-II-141, and indicate that it
would indeed be suitable for clinical development towards
resistant cancer therapy or treatment of gliomas, which
are limited by physiological barriers where the ABCG2
transporter plays a central role.

METHODS
Products
MBL-II-141 was synthetized by Prof. A. Boumendjel
(UMR 5063, Grenoble, France) as previously described
[31]. Corn oil (#C8267-500ML) and DMSO (#D2650100ML) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (France).
Matrigel (#734-1100) was obtained from VWR. DMEM
(#E15-883), penicillin/streptomycin (#P11-010) and G418

Oncotarget

(#P11-012) were supplied by GE Healthcare Life Sciences
(France). FBS (#ES98PS) was obtained from Abcys.
CPT-11 and heparin were kindly provided by
Dr. C. Rioufol (Hospices Civils of Lyon, France).

times a week with MBL-II-141 and CPT-11 (20 mg/kg)
for one month.

Cell lines

4.106 HEK-pcDNA3.1 or HEK-ABCG2 cells were
sub-cutaneously injected into one flank of each SCID
mouse, in solution with 50% matrigel. After the apparition
of most tumors, mice were randomly distributed into
4 groups of 20 animals (10 ABCG2 negative and 10
ABCG2-positive tumors). In detail, group 1 received only
vehicles (PBS and corn oil/5% DMSO); group 2 received
only MBL-II-141 (10 mg/kg and PBS); group 3 received
only CPT-11 (20 mg/kg and corn oil/5% DMSO) and
group 4 received both molecules (MBL-II-141 at 10 mg/kg
and CPT-11 at 20 mg/kg). Two independent injections
were carried out per mouse.
Treatments were intraperitoneally administered
three times a week until mice sacrifice. To evaluate the
toxicity impacts of treatments, three times a week, mice
were weighed and their behaviour was observed; tumor
size was measured with a caliper in two perpendicular
dimensions. Finally, mice were sacrificed when the tumor
diameter reached 17 mm.

MBL-II-141 efficacy of chemosensitization
on just-established tumors

The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells
were transfected as previously described [42]. HEK293
pcDNA3.1 (empty vector) and HEK ABCG2 (pcDNA3
vector coding for ABCG2) cell lines were cultured in
DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.75 mg/mL G418. These
cell lines are weakly tumorigenic [28].

Animal experiments
All in vivo experiments were conducted by
accredited researchers (Drs. L. Payen and M. Honorat)
in accordance with the animal care guidelines of the
European Union and French laws, and were validated
by the local Animal Ethic Evaluation Committee
(CECCAPP). The investigation was conducted in
accordance with the ethical standards and according to the
Declaration of Helsinki and to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board. Four week-old female mice
(Charles River Laboratories) were maintained in a specific
pathogen-free animal facility AniCan at the Centre Léon
Bérard (agreement n° B 69 388 0202, Lyon, France). Mice
were randomly distributed into groups.
The experimental formulation of MBL-II-141
was determined according to its solubility properties.
MBL-II-141 [31] was dissolved in DMSO (maximal
solubility of 250 mg/mL), and 20-fold diluted in sterile
corn oil [43, 44].
At the end of experiments, total cardiac blood was
collected either from animals intraperitoneally treated
with 50 U.I./kg heparin (50 µL/mouse) for 1.5 h before
withdrawal of blood samples, or using dried heparinized
syringes to completely block clotting. Plasma was
separated from blood cells by centrifugation (for 30 s at
2000 g). Blood and plasma were stored at -80 °C until
drug quantification by LC-MS/MS.

Efficacy of chemosensitization on
well-established tumors
1.106 HEK ABCG2 cells were sub-cutaneously
injected into one flank of each SCID mouse, in solution
with 30% matrigel. Once the tumor reached 8 mm in
diameter (268 mm3 total volume), as previously described,
mice were treated either by vehicles (PBS and corn
oil/5% DMSO), MBL-II-141 (10 mg/kg and PBS), CPT-11
(20 mg/kg and corn oil/5% DMSO) or with the
combination (MBL-II-141 at 10 mg/kg and CPT-11 at
20 mg/kg). Each group contained 10 mice. The same
protocol of treatment and follow-up were applied.
MBL-II-141 pharmacokinetic study
SCID mice (n = 6 per group) were intraperitoneally
treated by MBL-II-141 either alone (10 mg/kg) or in
combination with CPT-11 (20 mg/kg). MBL-II-141
was administered for 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 6 h. CPT-11 was
administered either alone or in combination with
MBL-II-141 for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. In order to achieve
possible cumulative effects, reiterated administrations
(two or three) were carried out with a 4 h time interval
between administrations. Blood samples were collected at
either 1 h or 4 h after the last injection.
Total blood samples were collected using dried
heparinized syringes, avoiding modification of samples.
Blood and plasma were stored at -80°C. Brain and liver
were collected and stored at -80°C for LC MS/MS
quantification of MBL-II-141, CPT-11 and SN-38. Tissues
were crushed using a dried cold system.

MBL-II-141 tolerance assay
As recommended in the guidelines of The
International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use (ICH), the pilot tolerance study was conducted
by using three doses of MBL-II-141 in combination with
the anticancer agent CPT-11. SCID mice were randomly
distributed into three groups (n = 10) according to the
MBL-II-141 doses: 10 mg/kg (low concentration), 30 mg/kg
(intermediate concentration) or 50 mg/kg (maximal
solubility). They were intraperitoneally treated three

MBL-II-141 oral absorption study

Results in tissues were normalized to cellular protein
content. Results in tissues were normalized to cellular
protein content (C1600 Abott technology).

The availability of MBL-II-141 was evaluated by
force-feeding (n = 4), and compared to intraperitoneal
injection (n = 4). CD1 mice were treated with 10 mg/kg
of MBL-II-141. After 4 h of treatment, total blood was
collected from animals treated with heparin. Samples were
stored at -80°C until quantification.

Prediction by ACD Percepta software
Predictions of some ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion - toxicity) properties
were computed using the ACD Percepta software, version
14.0.0 running on an intel i7 CPU laptop computer
under windows 7. The default set and the ACD database
was used without any modifications. The software uses
proprietary set of QSAR (quantitative structure-activity
relationship) equations to predict ADMET properties.
The software is able to propose a reliable index (RI) made
on structurally-related compounds found by a Tanimoto
indice. The ACD standard library was used as database.

HPLC-MS/MS analysis
CPT-11, SN-38 and MBL-II-141 were quantified
in whole blood and in tissues by HPLC MS/MS
(ThermoElectron, San Jose, USA). One assay was used
for CPT-11 and SN-38 using gradient of elution with
water-formic acid 0.1% and acetonitrile-formic acid 0.1%.
Another gradient of elution was used for MBL-II-141
using ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5, 50 mM),
acetonitrile and propanol-2. Both assays were performed
on a C18 column HypersilGold, (ThermoElectron), 3.0 µm,
(100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d.). The mass spectrometry
analysis was performed in positive ion mode with
electrospray source. Labeled CPT-11, SN-38 and
MBL-II-141 were used as internal standards. CPT-11 and
13
C6-CPT-11 were quantitated in selected reaction
monitoring (SRM) mode using the transition m/z
587→124 and 593→124, respectively. SN-38 and 13C6SN-38 were quantitated in SRM mode using the transition
m/z 393→349 and 399→355, respectively. MBL-II-141
and 2H3-MBL-II-141 were quantitated in SRM mode using
the transition m/z 547→342 and 550→345, respectively.
A volume of 50 µL of whole blood or tissue solution was
introduced into a conic centrifuge and 50 µL of solution
of the internal standard and 300 µL of cold acetonitrile
were added. The sample was mixed and centrifuged for
10 min at 13000 g at 5°C. For MBL-II-141, 250 µL of the
clear supernatant was removed and evaporated to dryness
under a stream of nitrogen. The residues were resuspended
in 100 µL of mobile phase and 10 µL were injected into
the HPLC device. For CPT-11 and SN-38, 50 µL of
clear supernatant were diluted (1/5) in mobile phase and
10 µL were injected into the chromatographic device. For
MBL-II-141, calibration curves were from 5 to 1000 ng/mL
for whole blood and tissues analysis. For CPT-11 and
SN-38, calibration curves were from 50 to 5000 ng/mL
for whole blood and liver and from 50 to 500 ng/mL for
brain. When the concentration was over the upper standard
concentration, a dilution of the sample was performed
using blank whole blood or appropriate tissues. Peak area
ratios of compound to the respective internal standard
measured at each nominal concentration were used to
construct weighted (1/concentration) least-square linear
regression curves. For the three compounds, the withinrun precision and the between-run precision of the assay
was less than 10%. Assay accuracy was in the range of
91–108%. The lower limit of quantification of compounds
in medium was set at the lowest standard concentration.

Statistical analysis
Growth models. Tumor growth curves were modeled
with GraphPad© Software. Gaussian distribution models
were obtained according to the equation Y = Amplitude*exp
(-0.5*((X-Mean)/SD)^2). The amplitude was the height of
the center of the distribution in Y units. Mean was the X
value at the center of the distribution. SD was a measure of
the width of the distribution, in the same units as X. Another
model was applied for sum of two Gaussian distributions with
Y = one + two (One = Amplitude 1*exp(-0.5*((X-Mean1)/
SD1)^2) and Two = Amplitude 2*exp(-0.5*((X-Mean2)/
SD2)^2)). Amplitudes were the heights of the center of the
distribution in Y units. Means were the X values at the center
of the two distributions. SDs were measures of the widths of
the distributions, in the same units as X.
Paired t-test. The statistical test used was the
paired t-test. It was applied for all data of growth tumor
experiments and pharmacokinetics data.
