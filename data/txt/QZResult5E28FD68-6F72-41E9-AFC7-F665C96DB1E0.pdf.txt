ABSTRACT
Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is standard treatment for colorectal cancer. However,
resistance to L-OHP often leads to treatment failure or cancer relapse. Understanding
of the mechanism underlying L-OHP resistance is important to overcome the resistance
and improve colorectal cancer treatment. This study aimed to identify new proteins
that mediates L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer and elucidate their mode of
function. HT-29 cells were exposed to gradually increased concentration of L-OHP
to select L-OHP resistant HT-29/L-OHP cell line. Proteomic analysis of HT-29 and
HT-29/L-OHP cells were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins,
including Poly(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1). PCBP1 expression level in 20 cases of
L-OHP sensitive patients and 20 cases of L-OHP refractory patients was analyzed
by immunohistochemistry. Chemoresistance and Akt activation in HT-29 and HT-29/
L-OHP cells were analyzed by MTT assay and Western blot analysis. We identified
37 proteins showing differential expression in HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29 cells. In
particular, PCBP1 protein level increased 15.6 fold in HT-29/L-OHP cells compared to
HT-29 cells. Knockdown of PCBP1 sensitized HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29 cells to L-OHP,
while overexpression of PCBP1 increased L-OHP resistance in HT-29 cells. In addition,
PCBP1 expression was significantly higher in tumor samples from L-OHP refractory
patients than in those from L-OHP responsive patients. Furthermore, we found that
knockdown of PCBP1 inhibited the activation of Akt in HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29 cells. In
conclusion, our findings suggest that PCBP1 is a molecular marker of L-OHP resistance
in colorectal cancer and a promising target for colorectal cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

would be very helpful for colorectal cancer treatment,
especially for advanced colorectal cancer.
Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is the third-generation
platinum agent used as standard treatment for colorectal
cancer, especially for advanced colorectal cancer [2].
Like other platinum-based anti-cancer compounds,
L-OHP forms both inter- and intra-strand cross links in
DNA as platinum (Pt)-DNA adducts, which prevent DNA
replication and transcription, and cause cancer cell death.
L-OHP is administered via infusion as inactive prodrug,
and rapidly undergoes transformation in the blood to

Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of
cancer in both men and women in the United States, and
is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality
accounting for 9% of total cancer-related mortality in
the United States [1]. Over the past two decades, overall
colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates have been
declining, however, the prognosis of colorectal cancer
remains poor. Identification of novel effective drugs or
improvement of efficacy of anti-colorectal cancer drug

release cytotoxic dicholoro platinum complexes. L-OHP is
often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents such
as 5′FU to achieve synergistic effect, and can be used to
treat some refractory colorectal cancers [2, 3]. However,
resistance to L-OHP eventually develops, which leads to
treatment failure or cancer relapse. Understanding of the
mechanism underlying L-OHP resistance is very important
to overcome the resistance and improve its efficacy in
colorectal cancer treatment.
Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain
L-OHP resistance. Besides efflux of the drug out of cell
by plasma membrane pumps like MPR1, L-OHP could
be detoxified by glutathione (GSH) related enzymes
and Pt-DNA adducts lesions could be repaired by the
nucleotide excision repair system (NER) [4]. ERCC1
and XPA are key mediators of NER and regulate L-OHP
sensitivity [5–7]. DNA mismatch repair pathway (MMR)
also participates in L-OHP resistance by removal of
Pt-DNA adducts lesions. In this study, we systematically
screened protein factors that might be involved in L-OHP
resistance by the comparison of the proteome between
L-OHP sensitive HT-29 wild type cells and L-OHP
resistant HT-29 cells. Using the 2D gel electrophoresis
and MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry, we
identified 37 differentially expressed proteins. Among
them, we found that poly(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1)
was significantly induced in resistant cells, and our further
study indicated that PCBP1 protected cells from L-OHP
induced apoptosis. In addition, our analysis of clinical
samples showed that PCBP1 was overexpressed in tumor
samples from L-OHP resistant patients.

Screening of proteins that mediate L-OHP drug
resistance

RESULTS

PCBP1 is multifunctional RNA-binding protein that
regulates mRNA processing, translation and stability [8].
PCBP1 also functions as a cytosolic iron chaperone that
mediates the metalation of metalloproteins and enzymes,
and help maintain cytosolic metal pools [9, 10]. To
investigate the role of PCBP1 in L-OHP resistance, we
modulated PCBP1 expression in HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29
cells by shRNA knockdown or exogenous expression of
PCBP1 (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, knockdown
of PCBP1 in HT-29/L-OHP cells significantly decreased
IC50 in response to L-OHP. Knockdown of PCBP1 in
parental HT-29 further sensitized the cells to L-OHP. In
contrast, PCBP1 overexpression in HT-29 led to more
than 3 fold increase of resistance to L-OHP (Figure 3C).
These results demonstrated that PCBP1 increases L-OHP
resistance in HT-29 cancer cells and may be a molecular
marker of L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer.

To screen proteins responsible for L-OHP drug
resistance in HT-29/L-OHP cells other than MRP and
P-gp, 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) was performed
to compare protein expression profile between HT-29
and HT-29/L-OHP cells. We identified 37 protein spots
showing differential expression in HT-29/L-OHP and
HT-29 cells (Figure 2A, 2B). The identities of these proteins
were analyzed using MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass
spectrometry (MS). Protein function analysis showed that
these proteins belonged to several functional groups: 1. Ca2+
binding proteins such as ANXA1, ANXA3; 2. chaperons
such as HSPA1, HSPA8; 3. Metabolism such as GAPDH,
PPA1, PKM2; 4. Cytoskeleton such as CAPZA1, CAPG,
TUBB2A (Figure 2C). Identification of proteins involved
in multiple cellular functions suggested that the alteration
for drug resistance is complicated and involves multiple
signaling pathways and cellular processes.
To confirm the results of 2DE and MS, we
performed Western blot analysis to measure the protein
expression in HT-29 and HT-29/L-OHP cells. As expected,
PCBP1, ANXA3 and STIP1 protein levels increased in
HT-29/L-OHP cells (Figure 2D). In particular, PCBP1
protein level increased 15.6 fold in L-OHP resistant cells
than that in L-OHP sensitive parental cells, suggesting that
PCBP1 could be a molecular marker of L-OHP resistance.

PCBP1 is a molecular marker of L-OHP resistance
in colorectal cancer

Establishment of L-OHP resistant HT-29 cells
To reveal molecular mechanism responsible for
L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer, wild type HT-29 cells
sensitive to L-OHP were first treated with sub-lethal dose
L-OHP to induce and select partial resistant populations.
Then, L-OHP concentration was gradually increased and
finally a population of L-OHP resistant HT-29/L-OHP
cells were established. As shown in Figure 1A, the IC50
of parental wild type HT-29 was 4.15 ± 0.17 µg/mL, while
the IC50 of L-OHP resistant HT-29/L-OHP cells increased
to 32.01 ± 1.87 µg/mL, with drug resistance index of 7.71,
indicating that HT-29/L-OHP cells were significantly
resistant to L-OHP.
Multi-drug resistant protein (MRP) and P-glycoprotein
(P-gp, ABCB1) are known mediators for drug resistance
in cancer cells. As expected, we detected increased MRP
and P-gp levels in HT-29/L-OHP cells compared to
HT-29 parental cells (Figure 1B). Taken together, these
results suggest that we successfully established L-OHP
resistant HT-29 cell line.

analyzed 40 tumor samples from colorectal cancer patients
among which 20 cases were L-OHP sensitive and 20 cases
were L-OHP resistant. Immunochemistry analysis showed
that PCBP1 protein level was high in L-OHP resistant
patient tumor tissues (Figure 4A), but was very low in
L-OHP resistant peri-cancerous tissues, L-OHP sensitive
patient tumor tissues or L-OHP sensitive peri-cancerous
tissues (Figure 4B–4D), and the difference in PCBP1
expression level between L-OHP resistant cancerous tissue
and sensitive cancer tissue or peri-cancerous tissue was
significant (p < 0.05). These clinical data supported that
PCBP1 increases L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer.

L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer, we established
L-OHP resistant human colon cancer cell line by continuous
exposure of HT-29 cells to L-OHP from sub-lethal
concentration to gradually increased high concentration.
The IC50 of L-OHP resistant HT-29/L-OHP cell line was
increased more than 8 fold (from 4.15 ± 0.17 µg/mL to
32.01 ± 1.87 µg/mL). In addition, increased expression of
multi-drug resistant genes MRP1 and P-gp was detected
in HT-29/L-OHP cell line, indicating that we successfully
established L-OHP resistant colorectal cancer cell line as a
nice experimental model for further investigation of L-OHP
resistance in colorectal cancer.
Next, we systematically investigated the proteins
involved in L-OHP resistance in HT-29/L-OHP cells
by using 2D gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI
TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. We identified
37 proteins that were differently expressed in L-OHP
resistant versus sensitive cells. Protein function analysis
showed that these proteins had many different cellular
functions, including Ca2+ binding, molecular chaperons,
metabolism and cytoskeleton, which suggest that the
resistant cells undergo profound changes of expression
profiles to gain L-OHP resistance. It was reported that
increased DNA damage repair capability is an approach
to enhance L-OHP resistance by removing L-OHP caused
DNA damages through nucleotide excision repair and/or
mismatch repair pathways [6, 7]. Our results demonstrate
that there are many other cellular pathways involved in
L-OHP resistance, suggesting that L-OHP resistant cancer
cells are not merely dependent on one or two pathways
but undergo complicated evolution and impact complex
pathways to achieve resistance. Therefore, understanding
of all these pathways involved in resistance becomes the
key to overcome L-OHP resistance, since targeting one or
two pathways will not completely or effectively inhibit
the resistance.
Among 37 identified proteins, we confirmed
increased expression of PCBP1, ANXA3 and STIP1
in resistant cells by Western blot analysis. Especially,
PCBP1 level was increased 15.6 fold in L-OHP resistant

PCBP1 enhances the activation of Akt
To understand how PCBP1 mediates L-OHP
resistance in colorectal cancer, we focused on the effect
of PCBP1 on cellular survival signaling pathways.
Akt signaling pathway is one of important cell survival
pathways that protect cells from cell death caused by
many chemotherapy agents. Activation of Akt signaling
promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating
many components of the apoptotic machinery, such as Bad,
caspase 9, and pro-apoptotic transcription factor FKHRL1
[11]. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation of Akt
Ser473 in both HT-29 parental and resistant cells after
PCBP1 expression was silenced by shRNA. Knockdown
of PCBP1 led to significantly decreased p-Akt level in
both HT-29 parental and resistant cells, while the total
Akt level showed no significant changes (Figure 5). These
results indicated that PCBP1 enhances the activation of
Akt to promote cell survival.

DISCUSSION
Drug resistance is the major obstacle in cancer
treatment. L-OHP is the first line drug for colorectal cancer
treatment. However, resistance to L-OHP develops after
long term usage, which leads to refractory tumor and/or
cancer relapse. To understand the mechanism underlying

cells compared to L-OHP sensitive parental cells. PCBP1
is a multifunctional adaptor protein initially identified as
a RNA-binding protein [8, 12]. PCBP1 contains three
K-homologous (KH) domains and has high affinity to
poly(C) [12]. PCBP1 and its homologs can bind to mRNA
3′UTR pyrimidine-rich motif to stabilize mRNA and

regulate mRNA translation [13–17]. In addition, PCBP1
functions as cytosolic iron chaperone that facilitates iron
delivery to ferritin, the major cytosolic iron storage protein,
to metalloproteins, prolyl and asparagyl hydroxylases,
which regulate the stability of the α-subunit of hypoxiainducible factor (HIF), and to deoxyhypusine hydroxylase

(DOHH), which modifies hypusine in eukaryotic initiation
factor (eIF) 5A [9, 10, 18]. Our results showed that
knockdown of PCBP1 expression in both wild type and
L-OHP resistant HT-29 cells sensitized cells to L-OHP,
while overexpression of PCBP1 in HT-29 wild type cells
increased L-OHP resistance. Additionally, by comparison
of PCBP1 expression in tumor samples from L-OHP
responsive and refractory patients, we found that PCBP1
expression was significantly higher in tumor samples from
L-OHP resistant patients. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that PCBP1 plays an important role in L-OHP

resistance and can be served as a molecular marker for
L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer patients.
To further elucidate how PCBP1 mediates L-OHP
resistance, we investigated cell survival signaling pathways
and found that the activation of Akt signaling was linked
to increased expression of PCBP1. Interestingly, Akt2 was
reported to be able to phosphate PCBP1 and regulate its
activity [17, 19, 20], thus indicating a strong connection
between PCBP1 and Akt signaling pathway. PCBP1 might
protect cells from L-OHP by enhancing cell survival
pathway such as Akt signaling to prevent L-OHP induced

overnight at 4ºC, then washed with 1 × TBS/T 3 times,
5 min each time. The membranes were then incubated with
secondary antibody diluted in 1 × TBS/T with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with
1 × TBS/T 3 times, ECL reagent was added to visualize the
signal and the signal was analzyed by gel imager.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

MTT assay

Human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29 was
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Gibco) at 37ºC with 5% CO2. To establish L-OHP
resistant cell line, HT-29 cells in the exponential phase
of growth were exposed to 50 ng/ml L-OHP for 1 month.
L-OHP resistant HT-29/L-OHP cell line was established
three months after the drug treatment was initiated and
then maintained in L-OHP free medium and subcultured
for at least 3 times.

HT-29 or HT-29/L-OHP cells were seeded into
96-well plates and cultured in a humidified chamber at
37°C overnight. Next the cells were treated with L-OHP at
1 to 8 µg/mL. Then viable cells were evaluated with MTT
assay kit (Sigma, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 20 μL MTT (5 mg/mL) solution was added
to each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C for
4 h, then 150 μL DMSO was added to each well and the
plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The
absorption value was read at 490 nm using a microplate
reader (ELX800, Bio-Tek, USA).

2D gel electrophoresis

Immunohistochemistry

HT-29 and HT-29/L-OHP cells were harvested and
washed with 1 × PBS once, then lysed with lysis buffer
containing 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail. The lysate was
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants
were collected. Total protein lysate was first loaded into
pH gradient gel to be separated by isoelectric focusing.
Next, the proteins in pH gradient gel were separated
by SDS-PAGE. Then the gels were stained to visualize
protein spots. The protein spots with difference between
HT-29 and HT-29/L-OHP cells were identified and excised
from the gels for mass spectrometry.

The response of patients to L-OHP was evaluated
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Tumor samples were excised
from 20 cases of L-OHP sensitive patients and 20 cases of
L-OHP refractory patients, fixed in formalin, embedded
in paraffin and cut into 4 μm serial sections. Next,
endogenous peroxidase was quenched and the sections
were incubated with 2% goat serum at room temperature
for 1 h, then incubated with PCBP1 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA) overnight at 4°C. Afterwards, the
sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody. For negative control, IgG
serum was used instead of PCBP1 antibody.
Two experienced pathologists blindly evaluated
immunohistochemistry score. The percentage of cells
with staining was scored as:”0” (0%), “1” (1%–25%), “2”
(26%–50%), “3” (51%–100%). The staining intensity was
scored as:”0” (negative), “1” (weak), “2” (moderate), “3”
(strong). Immunohistochemistry score was obtained by
adding the two scores.

MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry
The protein spots were dried by vacuum and
digested by incubation with trypsin solution overnight.
Tryptic peptides were eluted and dried by vacuum. The
tryptic peptides were analyzed by AutoFlex TOF-TOF
LIFT Mass Spectrometer and the corresponding proteins
were identified by using the Mascot search engine against
NCBInr protein database.

Statistical analysis

Western blot analysis

Data were represented as the mean ± SD and
analyzed using SPSS version 12 statistical analysis
package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail. 50 µg total protein lysate were loaded on
SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h,
incubated with primary antibody for PCBP1, p-Akt Ser473,
Akt, ANXA3, STIP1, GAPDH, P-gp, MRP1, β-actin
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
