Abstract
The polyamine transport system (PTS) is an energy-dependent
machinery frequently overactivated in cancer cells with a high
demand for polyamines. We have exploited the PTS to
selectively deliver a polyamine-containing drug to cancer
cells. F14512 combines an epipodophyllotoxin core-targeting
topoisomerase II with a spermine moiety introduced as a cell
delivery vector. The polyamine tail supports three complementary functions: (a) facilitate formulation of a watersoluble compound, (b) increase DNA binding to reinforce
topoisomerase II inhibition, and (c) facilitate selective uptake
by tumor cells via the PTS. F14512 is 73-fold more cytotoxic to
Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with CHO-MG cells
with a reduced PTS activity. A decreased sensitivity of L1210
leukemia cells to F14512 was observed in the presence of
putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. In parallel, the
spermine moiety considerably enhances the drug-DNA interaction, leading to a reinforced inhibition of topoisomerase II.
The spermine tail of F14512 serves as a cell delivery vehicle as
well as a DNA anchor, and this property translates at the
cellular level into a distinct pharmacologic profile. Twentynine human solid or hematologic cell lines were used to
characterize the high cytotoxic potential of F14512 (median
IC50 of 0.18 Mmol/L). Finally, the potent antitumor activity of
F14512 in vivo was evidenced with a MX1 human breast tumor
xenograft model, with partial and complete tumor regressions. This work supports the clinical development of F14512
as a novel targeted cytotoxic drug and sheds light on the
concept of selective delivery of drugs to tumor cells expressing
the PTS. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9845–53]

Introduction
Natural polyamines, such as spermine and spermidine, are
ubiquitous polycationic molecules that play crucial roles in a
number of cell processes, including cell proliferation and
differentiation. They are involved in numerous steps of protein

synthesis, affect the biological activity of proteins, stabilize nucleic
acids, and contribute to cell growth (1). For these reasons, the need
for polyamines in tumor cells is crucial, and high levels of
polyamines have been detected in many tumor types (2, 3). Such an
accumulation might be a good marker for defining patients with
high risk of progression, as shown with colon cancer (4) or renal
cell carcinoma (5).
The critical role of polyamines in cell proliferation has
stimulated considerable interest in polyamine metabolism as a
new target for chemotherapy. Several polyamine derivatives have
been synthesized to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis enzymes, to
perturb polyamine homeostasis by activation of polyamine
catabolism, or to inhibit polyamine uptake (6, 7). These approaches
are currently the subject of an active research (8, 9).
In addition to the endogenous synthesis of polyamines, the
activity of the polyamine transport system (PTS) was also found
higher in proliferating cells than in resting cells (10) and the uptake
of polyamine by tumor tissues was superior to normal tissues (11).
The high specific activity of the PTS in tumor cells is thought to be
associated with the inability of biosynthetic enzymes to provide
sufficient levels of polyamines to sustain rapid cell division. These
bioproduction constraints are partially offset by scavenging polyamines from exogenous sources and many tumor types have been
shown to contain elevated levels of polyamines resulting from an
active PTS for importing exogenous polyamines. An active PTS has
been characterized in a large number of tumor cell lines from
different origins (12). In terms of molecular knowledge, although
much is known about the PTS in bacteria, yeast (13), and
leishmania (14), the mammalian PTS is the source of models (15)
but remains to be molecularly described. Nevertheless, there has
been a number of studies demonstrating that the selectivity of the
PTS is not restricted to natural polyamines (12, 16). Most of these
have involved alteration to the polyamine molecule itself to adjust
the chain length, spacing between charges, extent of alkylation, etc.
Based on this, polyamine vectorization was proposed as a valuable
strategy to increase the selectivity of anticancer agents. The
literature reports several examples of polyamine conjugates with
cytotoxic drugs, such as chlorambucil (17), nitroimidazoles (18),
aziridines (19), acridines (20), enediyenes (21), anthracenes (16),
naphtoquinones (22), camptothecin (23), and protoberberine
(24). All these conjugated drugs are DNA-interacting agents used
to develop a general strategy by exploiting both the transport
mechanism and the high affinity of polyammonium cations for
DNA. Nevertheless, only few studies report in vivo experiments and
none of them presented enough benefit to be developed because
the increased cytotoxicity of these compounds were, when tested
in vivo, correlated to an increased toxicity and/or a minor increase

of antitumor efficacy (19, 23, 25). We report here the first successful
design of novel, highly potent polyamine-containing drug exploiting the PTS for tumor cell delivery.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Drugs
F14512 and etoposide were provided by Pierre Fabre Médicament. The
design and synthesis of F14512 have been patented (WO 2005/100363) and
the structure-activity relationships will be described elsewhere. F14512 and
etoposide were dissolved in DMSO and used in cellular assays at a maximal
final concentration of 0.1%. Putrescine, spermidine, spermine and 3-[4,5dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. [14C]Spermidine (112 mCi/mmol) was purchased from
Amersham.

Evaluation of Antiproliferative Activity against Chinese
Hamster Ovary Cell Lines
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were chosen along with a mutant cell
line (CHO-MG) to determine how the test compounds gain access to cell. The
CHO-MG cell line is polyamine transport deficient and was isolated after
selection for growth resistance to methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone), using a
single-step selection after mutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate (26). CHO
cells were cultured in monolayers using a-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
fungizone (1.25 Ag/mL), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/100 Ag/mL).
CHO and CHO-MG cells were plated at 2  103/mL for 24 h and then the
antiproliferative activity of test compounds was measured, in the presence of 2
mmol/L aminoguanidine, using the ATPlite assay as described above. Controls
were carried out to verify that, under our experimental conditions, aminoguanidine was not cytotoxic to CHO and CHO-MG cells.

Exogenous Natural Polyamines

Cell Culture and Cell Growth Inhibition
All cell lines were propagated by standard tissue culture procedures in
the medium suggested by the supplier (Supplementary Data). The
antiproliferative activity of test compounds was measured after 72 h of
incubation using the ATPlite assay (Perkin-Elmer) on a comprehensive
panel of 29 cell lines. EC50 values were determined with curve-fitting
analysis (nonlinear regression curve, variable hill slope coefficient),
performed with the algorithm provided by GraphPad Software.

The antiproliferative effects of F14512 and etoposide have been evaluated
according to a procedure described previously (20). Briefly, murine leukemia
L1210 cells were cultivated in 96-well plates in the presence of F14512
or etoposide at appropriate concentrations and 500 Amol/L putrescine,
100 Amol/L spermidine, 50 Amol/L spermine, or physiologic saline as
control in a medium containing 2 mmol/L aminoguanidine. After 48 h, cell
growth was determined using MTT as described previously.

F14512, a Novel Vectored Cytotoxic Drug

Spermidine Uptake Inhibition
The ability of F14512 and etoposide to compete with [14C]spermidine
uptake was determined in L1210 cells in vitro according a procedure
previously described (27). K i values for inhibition of spermidine uptake were
determined using the Cheng Prussoff equation from the IC50 values derived
by iterative curve fitting of the sigmoidal equation describing the velocity of
spermidine uptake of the respective competitor.

Topoisomerase II Inhibition
Cleavage of plasmid DNA. The experimental procedure has been
previously detailed (28).

Cleavage of a radiolabeled DNA fragment. Ten nanograms of 5¶-end
radiolabeled DNA probe (a 374-bp fragment of c-myc between positions
65 and 425 of its genome) was incubated for 5 min at 37jC with 1 AL
(2 units) of purified human topoisomerase IIa (TopoGen) in the presence of
test compound or 2.5% DMSO as control and treated as previously
described (29). We defined for each assay the maximum tolerated
concentration of DMSO to avoid any solvent effect. DMSO (3-5%, depending
on the batch of enzyme) can be used with these topoisomerase II assays. In
addition, 10 ng of a longer fragment of c-myc (401 bp) were added as
control of precipitation efficacy. Dried gels were numerized for quantification using a Molecular Imager FX apparatus and its Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad).

Comet Assay
The comet assay was adapted from a published procedure (30). A549
human lung cancer cells were seeded into culture dishes, at 1  106 cells per
dish, and cultured for 24 h before treatment at 37jC for 1, 2, 4, 6, or 24 h with
the solvent or with the test drug. The comets, stained with 2.5 Ag/mL
picogreen (Molecular Probes), were then analyzed using the tail moment
(TM) parameters (31) calculated by the Comet Assay III software
(Perseptive). Fifty cells were analyzed per slide and each experimental
point resulted from two independent experiments.

Differential Cytotoxicity with CHO-K1 and xrs-6 Cell Lines
These two cell lines were cultivated as previously described (32). The
drug cytotoxicity was evaluated using the ATPlite assay as mentioned
above. IC50 values were determined after 48 h of drug treatment to calculate
the IC50CHO-K1/IC50xrs6 ratio. A ratio of >2 reflects a major contribution of DNA
double strand breaks (DSB) in the cytotoxic action of the drug.

Tumor Growth Inhibition
Homozygous female athymic nude mice (Ico: Swiss-nu/nu, Charles River)
were implanted with MX-1 human breast tumor xenografts and treated as
previously described (33). Animals were handled and cared for in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(National Research Council, 1996) and the European Directive EEC/86/609,
under the supervision of authorized investigators. Two evaluation criteria
were used in parallel: (a) growth inhibition, calculated as the ratio of
the median tumor volumes of drug-treated versus control groups, T/C,
% = (median tumor volume of drug-treated group on day x/median tumor
volume of control group on day x)  100, the optimal value, being the
minimal T/C ratio that reflects the maximal tumor growth inhibition
achieved (34); (b) tumor regression, defined as partial if the tumor volume
decreased by 50% or less of that at the start of treatment, without dropping
below measurable size, or defined as complete if the tumor burden became
impalpable (35). Maximum weight loss or gain, expressed as a percentage of
the initial body weight of the experimental animals, was used to provide an
assessment of the toxicity of test compounds. According to National Cancer
Institute (NCI) criteria, a dose is considered toxic if the induced body
weight loss is higher than 20% of the initial mouse body weight (36).

Etoposide is arguably one of the most specific and potent
inhibitor of topoisomerase II. This old drug remains extensively
used for the treatment of different types of malignancies, including
small-cell lung cancers, testicular tumors, and non–Hodgkin’s
lymphomas. The glycosidic moiety of etoposide at the C4 position
(Fig. 1A) plays little or no role in the interaction with the
topoisomerase II target (37) but it subtly alters DNA interactions
(38). Based on these considerations, we designed a topoisomerase
II inhibitor that preserves the aglycone part of etoposide,
substituted on the C4 position by a polyamine tail susceptible to
provide water solubility, DNA interaction, and recognition by the
PTS expressed on tumor cells. The structure of the polyamine was
optimized, as well as the linker between the two parts of the

CHO and CHO-MG cells, characterized by IC50 values of 1.1 and
0.9 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Competition of F14512 with natural polyamines. The
antiproliferative effect of F14512 against L1210 murine leukemia
cells was characterized by an IC50 value of 20 nmol/L (Fig. 3A).
Protection was observed by the addition of exogenous native
polyamines because the antiproliferative activity of F14512 was
massively reduced from 10- to 30-fold. In contrast, the addition of
polyamines in the culture medium had no significant effect on the
antiproliferative activity of etoposide (Fig. 3B).
To confirm whether the intracellular accumulation of F14512
was dependent on the PTS, we determined its ability to compete
with [14C]spermidine for uptake in L1210 cells. F14512 competitively inhibited the transport of [14C]spermidine in L1210 with a
K i value of 0.34 F 0.04 Amol/L. This value corresponds to a low
calculated K i compared with other polyamine conjugates (27, 40).
In contrast, addition of etoposide up to 150 Amol/L did not inhibit
the uptake of [14C]spermidine, preventing the determination of a
K i value. The IC50 and K i values of F14512 obtained with L1210 cells
are entirely consistent with the cytotoxicity determined with the
CHO/CHO-MG pair of cell lines and, collectively, these data show
that F14512 enters into cancer cells via the PTS.

DNA Binding and Damaging Activity of F14512

with the drug and strand breaks were visualized on agarose gels. In brief,
supercoiled pLAZ (130 ng, lane DNA ) was incubated with 4 units topoisomerase
II in the absence (lane Topo II) or presence of increasing concentrations (5, 10,
20, or 50 Amol/L) of F14512 or etoposide. DNA samples were separated by
electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 1 Ag/mL ethidium bromide. Gels
were photographed under UV light. Nck, nicked; Sc, supercoiled; Lin, linear. The

c-myc probe was used as control for DNA precipitation (T1 ) and was added to
the 374-bp radiolabeled DNA fragments in the absence of topoisomerase II (T2 )
or incubated with this enzyme (T3 ). Cleavage patterns were visualized after
electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and numerization. Plain

molecule, to finally select F14512 composed of an epipodophyllotoxin core linked to spermine via an acetamide linker (Fig. 1B).

PTS-Dependent Cytotoxicity of F14512
Selective activity against a CHO cell line proficient for PTS.
CHO cells were chosen along with a mutant CHO-MG cell line to
study the selective transport of F14512 via the PTS. CHO-MG cells,
selected for its resistance to the antitumor agent methylglyoxalbis(guanylhydrazone), a cytotoxic analogue of spermidine which is
substrate of the PTS, are deficient in polyamine uptake (26). These
cells have been routinely used to define the molecular requirements for the selective delivery of polyamine conjugates into cells
containing active polyamine transporters (27, 39). Comparison of
drug cytotoxicity in these two cell lines provided an important
screen to detect cell entry via the PTS. In perfect agreement with
the design strategy, we observed that F14512 was 73-fold more
cytotoxic against CHO with an active transport system compared
with CHO-MG cells (Fig. 2B). The IC50 values for F14512 were
0.12 and 8.7 Amol/L in CHO and CHO-MG cells, respectively, which
strongly suggest that F14512 enters into CHO cells via the PTS. In
contrast, etoposide produced a similar cytotoxicity against both

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

The stabilization of DNA topoisomerase II covalent complexes
by etoposide leads to DNA DSBs but the drug shows minimal, if
any, interaction with DNA in the absence of the enzyme. In sharp
contrast, F14512 is a solid DNA binder, capable of protecting
DNA from heat denaturation. At a drug/DNA nucleotide ratio of
0.5, F14512 increases the melting temperature of calf thymus DNA
and poly(dAT)2 by 6jC and 17jC, respectively, and the interaction
was also characterized by UV spectroscopy (hypochromic at
bathromic shifts at 285 nm) and circular dichroism (induction of
a positive circular dichroism at 285 nm upon binding to DNA,
suggesting minor groove binding; data not shown). No effect was
observed with a non–polyamine-conjugated etoposide derivative.
This interaction is directly attributable to the cationic spermine
moiety binding to the DNA phosphate backbone and/or within the
minor groove of the double helix.
Two complementary approaches were deployed to investigate
inhibition of topoisomerase II. First, a plasmid cleavage assay was
used to evidence the induction of DNA DSBs. As shown in Fig. 3A,
supercoiled plasmid DNA was treated with human topoisomerase
II in the presence of increasing concentrations of etoposide or
F14512 and the DNA relaxation/cleavage products were resolved by
electrophoresis on agarose gel. A net increase in the band
corresponding to linear DNA (reflecting DSBs) was noted with
F14512, which appeared to be considerably more potent than
etoposide. Second, drug-induced cleavage of DNA by topoisomerase II was investigated using a 32P-radiolabeled 374-bp DNA
substrate corresponding to a portion of the c-myc oncogene. The
cleavage profiles, mapped on polyacrylamide gels, were compared
for the two drugs (Fig. 3B). The two molecules produced similar
(but not strictly identical) cleavage sites at defined nucleotide
positions, but here, again, it can be clearly seen that F14512 was
significantly more potent than etoposide. In this assay, the cleavage
sites were easily detected with 10 Amol/L F14512, whereas a 10-fold
higher concentration of etoposide was needed to produce a
comparable pattern. At the highest concentration (100 Amol/L),
a few sites were detected with F14512 but not with etoposide.
The results from the two topoisomerase assays are mutually

F14512, a Novel Vectored Cytotoxic Drug

consistent and establish that F14512 is a highly potent topoisomerase II poison in vitro. Its high capacity to stabilize cleavable
complexes is most likely attributable to its reinforced DNA binding
capacity via the polyamine tail.

DNA Damage in Cells
The DNA-damaging activity was also evaluated in cellulo using
A549 human lung cancer cells, which present an active uptake
system for polyamines (40). Cells were incubated 1 to 24 h in the
presence of F14512 or etoposide at 50 or 500 nmol/L, respectively.
These concentrations are close to the IC50 values of antiproliferative activities (Fig. 5) and were chosen to compare the two
compounds at roughly equicytotoxic concentrations. Interestingly,
although F14512 was much more potent than etoposide in terms of
DNA damages in vitro, a lower amount of DNA strand breaks was
observed in cellulo (Fig. 4A and B). Typical cell images from the
Comet assay are presented in Fig. 4A and the variation of the TM as
a function of the time of incubation is presented (Fig. 4A). TM
values of 5.2 F 1.0 were measured with 50 nmol/L F14512 after 4 to
6 h incubation, whereas etoposide at 500 nmol/L induced a larger
amount of DNA strand breaks, characterized by a TM value of
11.5 F 3.6. The kinetics of action of the two molecules are distinct.
The comet formed rapidly with etoposide after 1 h of treatment
and then decreased, with a minor TM value after 6 h, whereas the
comet formed progressively with F14512 and persisted after 6 h.
F14512 is 35 times more cytotoxic than etoposide against A549
cells but apparently less DNA damages are sufficient to produce
this cytotoxic effect. The balance between strand breaks formation
and DNA repair may be different for the two compounds. These
data indicate that F14512 functions as a DNA-damaging agent in
cells and that its mode of action is not entirely superimposed to
that of etoposide.
The contribution of DNA damages (topoisomerase II–induced
DSBs) to drug-induced cell death was evaluated using a pair of cell
lines with a normal or a deficient DNA repair machinery. The mutant
xrs6 cell line (41) bears a mutated form of the Ku80 subunit of
DNA-PK, thus providing a hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and
drugs producing DNA DSBs repaired by nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ) recombination (42). IC50 values for the wild-type (CHO-K1)
and mutated (xrs6) cell lines are indicated in Fig. 4C along with the
IC50CHO-K1/IC50xrs6 ratio, which reflects the contribution of DNA DSBs
(repaired by NHEJ) in the cytotoxic action of the drug. As expected,
etoposide was more cytotoxic to xrs6 cells than to CHO-K1 cells
(IC50CHO-K1/IC50xrs6 ratio = 4.64), in agreement with previous data
reported with different pairs of DSB repair deficient and proficient
cell lines (43, 44). Interestingly, F14512 was 160-fold more cytotoxic
to xrs6 cells compared with etoposide and the IC50CHO-K1/IC50xrs6 ratio
with F14512 was about 10 times higher than that of etoposide. This
result confirms that F14512 induces deleterious DSBs and suggests
that the nature of lethal DNA damages induced by etoposide and
F14512 are different. The DNA repair pathway activated by F14512
remains to be elucidated at this point.

In vitro Antiproliferative Activity
The antiproliferative effect of F14512 on 29 human solid or
hematologic cancer cell lines were determined (Fig. 5A) and
compared with etoposide (Fig. 5B). After 72 h of incubation, F14512
inhibited the growth of these cells with a median EC50 value of 0.18
Amol/L that was about 8-fold lower than that of etoposide with a
median EC50 of 1.4 Amol/L. The antiproliferative activity of F14512
was superior to that of etoposide against 21 of 29 cell lines (Fig. 5;
Supplementary Data). The superiority of F14512 was particularly

www.aacrjournals.org

important with MX-1 (breast), LOX-IMV1 (melanoma), HL-60
(leukemia), SW872 (liposarcoma), or MESA (sarcoma) cell lines
because EC50 values of F14512 was 23 to 88 lower than that of
etoposide. On the other hand, eight cell lines were more sensitive
to etoposide than to F14512 and this is consistent with the idea
that the mechanism of action of the two compounds might be not
strictly identical.
It is worth to mention that all these experiments were performed
without aminoguanidine. To verify that the batch of serum used in
these experiments did not contain a high level of serum amine
oxidase (45), F14512 was retested in the same conditions (identical
medium and serum, 72 h of incubation) but in the presence of
2 mmol/L aminoguanidine against a subpanel of five cell lines
(BxPC3, LOVO, Namalwa, SKOV3, and SKBR3); no significant
variation of EC50 values was observed (data not shown). Therefore,
a cytotoxic action resulting from an oxidization of spermine moiety
of F14512 by serum amine oxidase is not considered.

In vivo Antitumor Activity
As mentioned above, MX-1 breast tumor cells were found to be
much more sensitive to F14512 than to etoposide (IC50 values of 57.1
nmol/L and 1.31 Amol/L, respectively; Fig. 5). The corresponding
in vivo model was available; therefore, we compared the antitumor
activity of the two molecules in this xenograft model. The median
tumor volumes of the MX-1 breast tumor-bearing mice treated over
2 weeks with a range of doses of F14512 are shown in Fig. 6. F14512
shows an outstanding activity in this model. Indeed, a high activity
against these MX-1 tumors, with treatments starting 7 days after
tumor implantation, was obtained at 1.25 mg/kg/injection, with
evidence of partial and complete tumor regressions. At 1.25 mg/kg/
injection (Fig. 6C), 7 of 10 mice exhibited complete tumor
regression, with 4 mice showing no tumor regrowth (cures) before
the end of the experiment (day 46), whereas tumor regrowth was
detected in the two other cases from days 36 or 39 (Fig. 6B and C).
Optimal T/C values of <10%, namely 0% to 9%, obtained at 0.63 to
1.25 mg/kg/injection, were also indicative of a high level of activity
according to the criteria of Corbett and colleagues (36). Furthermore, the lower dose of 0.32 mg/kg/injection also resulted in a
significant antitumor activity, reflected by a T/C ratio of 26%
(Fig. 6A). The lowest dose tested (i.e., 0.16 mg/kg/injection) proved
to be inactive, whereas cures were observed for 14 of 15 mice with
F14512 at 2.5 mg/kg/injection but this dose was associated with
toxicity (data not shown). Overall, these data showed the superior
antitumor activity of F14512 to etoposide, which showed only
marginal in vivo activity against MX-1 tumor xenografts (Fig. 6D).
For etoposide, the dose of 20 mg/kg/injection proved to be inactive,
according to the NCI criteria, with T/C values ranging from 49% to
52%. A higher activity was obtained at 30 mg/kg/injection, with
evidence of 30% partial tumor regressions; however, this marked
antitumor activity was associated with toxicity (data not shown).
These in vivo data leave no room for doubt that F14512 is a highly
potent antitumor agent in this MX-1 breast human tumor xenograft
model when administered i.p. as multiple injections over 2 weeks.
This spermine-linked epipodophyllotoxin derivative is considerably
more potent than etoposide in this breast cancer model.

Discussion
F14512 was designed with the goal to combine the potent
cytotoxic properties of epipodophyllotoxin derivatives and a
vectorization to cancer cells via the PTS. In addition, we reasoned
that the polyamine moiety, acting as a substrate for the PTS, could

Figure 4. A, representative images of cellular DNA damages, as seen by the comet assay, observed in the presence of etoposide (500 nmol/L) and F14512

serve as a DNA anchor and would provide water solubility. A family
of polyamine-epipodophyllotoxin conjugates, with different linkers
and lengths of the polyamine chain, was designed and synthesized.
The spermine derivative F14512 was selected on the basis of
multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments. F14512 was considerably
(73-fold) more cytotoxic against PTS-proficient CHO cells compared with CHO-MG cells. This high ratio clearly speaks for a
specific recognition of F14512 by the PTS. The fact that natural
polyamines have no effect on the cytotoxicity of etoposide but
decreased the cytotoxicity of F14512 against L1210 murine
leukemia cells, known for their active PTS (46), corroborated
the conclusion of a specific uptake of F14512 by the PTS. The
competition of F14512 for the PTS was then confirmed by the
inhibition of [14C]spermidine uptake, which was characterized by a
sub–Amol/L K i value. Altogether, these data show that F14512
exhibits a high affinity for the PTS.
In addition to the vectorization via the PTS, the spermine moiety
of F14512 can be exploited for the high affinity of polyammonium
cation for DNA (47). This property has already been used to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

strengthen the activity of several DNA-damaging agents, including
topoisomerase II poisons (20, 48). In this context, one can expect to
increase the stability of epipodophyllotoxin/DNA/topoisomerase II
ternary complexes by a stronger interaction of DNA with the
positively charged polyamine chain. However, this idea is not so
trivial because it requires a careful design to link the DNAinteracting group to the molecule without reducing accessibility to
and inhibition of topoisomerase II. The C4-linked epipodophyllotoxin aglycone is an optimal candidate for this strategy when one
takes into account the mode of interaction between etoposide and
the DNA topoisomerase II complex (37, 38). The data presented
here clearly establish that at the DNA topoisomerase II level, our
design strategy was also correct. F14512 is a 10-fold more potent
topoisomerase II poison than etoposide in vitro and this is most
likely a direct consequence of its increased affinity for DNA. The
spermine moiety does not alter the location of the cleavage sites on
DNA. Similar observations have been reported previously with
other polyamine-based DNA-binding conjugates, such as a
chlorambucil conjugate (49). Our fine tuning of the podospermine

F14512, a Novel Vectored Cytotoxic Drug

Figure 5. Antiproliferative activity of F14512 (A ) compared with etoposide (B). Inhibition of proliferation was assessed using the ATPlite (Perkin-Elmer) assay on a
panel of 29 cell lines after 72 h of incubation. EC50 values were determined with a curve-fitting analysis (nonlinear regression curve, variable hill slope coefficient). The
representation of the EC50 values was compared with a cutoff concentration chosen at 1 Amol/L. Vertical dotted bars, median of EC50 to display the general
antiproliferative potency of each compound. *, for KB cells treated with F14512, EC50 > 100 Amol/L.

hybrid has been successful to simultaneously address the issues of
cell delivery and DNA topoisomerase II targeting.
At a cellular level, it is interesting to notice that F14512 and
etoposide, when used at the equicytotoxic concentrations, did not
show a comparable potency for inducing DNA damage. F14512 is

f10-fold more cytotoxic than etoposide against A549 cells but
induced around 5-fold less DNA strand breaks. We are convinced
that the spermine moiety of F14512 is not only a cell delivery vector
but also plays a direct role in the mechanism of action leading to
the antiproliferative activity. At this stage, we cannot exclude the

at 0.32 mg/kg/injection (A), 0.63 mg/kg/injection (B ), or
1.25 mg/kg/injection (C ), on MX-1 breast human tumor
s.c. implanted in mice (Median tumor volume ). The best
response obtained with etoposide when administered
according the same procedure at 20 mg/kg/injection is
presented as comparison (D ). Each condition has been
evaluated against a total of 10 to 15 tumor-bearing mice in
two to three separate experiments, each using five mice.
Data relative to control and treated animals are

possibility that F14512 presents a cell uptake or subcellular
distribution profile distinct from than of etoposide. The implication of another biological target, interacting with the polyamine
tail, may also be considered to account for the high antiproliferative activity of the conjugate. A similar finding was reported
previously with anthracene or acridine polyamine conjugates and
topoisomerase inhibition (48). Another plausible hypothesis is that
F14512 produces specific DNA damages at distinct genomic loci,
which are not easily repaired and more lethal for tumor cells. The
mechanism of DNA damages and repair remains to be investigated
with this compound.
The antiproliferative activity of F14512 was evaluated against a
panel of 29 human solid or hematologic cancer cell lines and
compared with that etoposide. The superior antiproliferative
activity of F14512 was shown with 21 of 29 cell lines. This
observation likely reflects the degree of PTS activity in these 21
cancer cell lines and how its use for guided drug delivery can be an
advantageous. Interestingly, the overall profiles of F14512 and
etoposide are not strictly similar (with a Pearson coefficient of
correlation of 0.75), suggesting here again that the spermine moiety
of F14512 plays a significant role in its efficacy. The superiority of
F14512 was particularly important with cell lines from breast
cancer, liposarcoma, melanoma, and leukemia.
The high potential of F14512 was confirmed in vivo using the
MX-1 human breast tumor xenograft model. This cell line exhibits a
23-fold higher sensitivity to F14512 compared with etoposide
in vitro and this trend was also seen in vivo. F14512 displays a
marked antitumor activity when administered i.p. as multiple
injections over 2 weeks. A marked antitumor activity without toxic
side effects was observed over a wide range of doses of 0.32 to
1.25 mg/kg/injection. The optimal T/C values <10% at 0.63
and 1.25 mg/kg/injection were judged as representative of a high
level of activity according to standard criteria (36) and were
associated with partial or complete tumor regression. F14512
proved to be considerably more potent than etoposide against
MX-1 tumor xenografts, with apparently a much larger therapeutic

index. Indeed, etoposide exerts an activity against this model at
30 mg/kg/injection, but this dose was associated with toxicity
because 30% of treated mice at this high dose exhibited weight loss
of >20%. The higher dose of 40 mg/kg/injection was associated with
definite toxicity, as reflected by a maximal median body weight
loss of 20.5% and 20% early deaths. Under identical conditions,
F14512 proved much more active and well tolerated at a range of
active doses. Therefore, although F14512 is structurally related to
etoposide, its pharmacologic profile appears to be distinct. To our
knowledge, this is the first time that a highly pronounced
superiority is shown with a polyamine-containing derivative of an
established drug. In summary, we described here the properties of
F14512, the leading compound of a novel class of targeted cytotoxic
agents that exploit the PTS to deliver a drug selectively into cancer
cells. F14512 functions as a highly active topoisomerase II poison
that produces DNA damage. Its spermine moiety contributes to the
uptake into cancer cells via the PTS and plays a role in mediating
cytotoxic activity. The drug is significantly more cytotoxic than
etoposide and highly active in vivo in the MX1 human breast tumor
model. This study provides a strong rationale for the clinical
development of F14512 and to further exploit the concept of
selective delivery of drugs to tumor cells expressing the PTS.
