ABSTRACT
The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily of enzymes is critical for the
detoxification of drugs and toxins in the human body; these enzymes are involved not
only in the development of drug resistance in cancer cells but also in the metabolism
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Here, we demonstrated that AKR1C1/C2
increased the metabolism of ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB) in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. Previous studies have shown that EDHB can
effectively induce esophageal cancer cell autophagy and apoptosis, and the AKR1C
family represents one set of highly expressed genes after EDHB treatment. To explore
the cytotoxic effects of EDHB, esophageal cancer cells with higher (KYSE180) or lower
(KYSE510) AKR1C expression levels were evaluated in this study. The proliferation
of KYSE180 cells was inhibited more effectively than that of KYSE510 cells by EDHB
treatment. Furthermore, the effective subunits of the AKR superfamily, AKR1C1/C2,
were quantitatively identified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays. The
sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to EDHB was significantly attenuated by the
siRNA knockdown of AKR1C1/C2. Moreover, the expression of autophagy inducers
(Beclin, LC3II and BNIP3) and NDRG1 was significantly elevated in KYSE180 cells,
but not in KYSE510 cells, after EDHB treatment. When autophagy was inhibited by
3-methyladenine, KYSE180 cells exhibited an increased sensitivity to EDHB, which may
be a metabolic substrate of AKR1C1/C2. These results indicated that ESCC patients
with high AKR1C1/C2 expression may be more sensitive to EDHB, and AKR1C1/
C2 may facilitate EDHB-induced autophagy and apoptosis, thus providing potential
guidance for the chemoprevention of ESCC.

cases in Asian countries [2]. Currently, the precise etiology
and pathogenesis of esophageal cancer are unclear, and
there is a lack of effective methods for early diagnosis. As
a consequence, the majority of esophageal cancer patients
are diagnosed at intermediate and advanced stages; their
therapeutic results are poor [3, 4], and the 5-year survival

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common
cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide [1]. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC) accounts for nearly 90% of esophageal cancer

rate is no greater than 19% [5, 6]. The development and
progression of esophageal cancer are multi-factorial,
multi-stage progressive processes that result from the joint
action of environmental and genetic factors. However,
interventions that treat precancerous lesions could reverse
the evolution of esophageal cancer. Phenolic compounds,
such as ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB), form a
class of chemical anticancer agents that act on the Nrf2/
ARE pathway. Such compounds are widely distributed in
fruits and vegetables and show strong antioxidant effects.
EDHB is also known as protocatechuic acid ethyl
ester. The monomer component of EDHB is present in a
variety of plant species, mainly in the leaves and roots.
EDHB was identified in studies on the composition of
the peanut seed coat, wine, and tea leaves, and it exerts
relatively low antioxidant activity [7–9]. Therefore, EDHB
can be used as a fat and cream antioxidant, a food additive,
and a pharmaceutical intermediate. EDHB is a substrate
analog of prolyl hydroxylase and acts as a competitive
inhibitor. It inhibits the ubiquitination/degradation
of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and promotes the
expression of downstream genes (e.g., erythropoietin and
vascular endothelial growth factor), thus exerting critical
biological effects [10]. EDHB also protects L6 myoblasts
from hypoxia-induced oxidative damage [11] and inhibits
collagen secretion from breast cancer cells, thus preventing
tumor metastasis. This activity has been shown to reduce
tumor fibrosis and metastasis in a mouse model of breast
cancer, thereby providing a new potential treatment for
breast cancer [12]. Previous research has also shown
that EDHB inhibits esophageal cancer cell proliferation
by increasing autophagy and apoptosis through NDRG1
and BNIP3 and markedly increases AKR1C1, AKR1C2,
and AKR1C3 mRNA expression [13]. Therefore, it may
be possible to identify new methods to inhibit esophageal
cancer by investigating the effect of EDHB on esophageal
cancer cells and its underlying molecular mechanism.
The members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR)
superfamily are monomeric cytoplasmic proteins with a
molecular weight of 34–37 kDa. AKRs catalyze the reduction
of aldehydes and ketones into the corresponding alcohol
compounds, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) serves as a coenzyme. The AKRs
can be divided into 15 families, and the AKR1C subfamily
includes four isoenzymes, AKR1C1–AKR1C4. These
isoenzymes are capable of reducing 3-, 17-, and 20-ketone
steroids in vitro [14] and of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) [15]. Additionally, AKR1C participates in the
metabolism of numerous exogenous drugs and enhances the
metabolism of certain endogenous and exogenous substrates.
Many important drugs, such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin,
haloperidol, and the novel anticancer drug oracin, are
metabolized by carbonyl-reducing enzymes, including
AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and
AKR1C3 [16]. However, EDHB is an exogenous substance
with a similar structure to the metabolic substrates of AKR1C
(i.e., PAHs). For this reason, we confirmed that EDHB is a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metabolic substrate of AKR1C. The most recent study on
this topic showed that prostate tumor samples with activated
AKR1C1, an androgen-metabolizing enzyme, harbor high
Sp1 and c-FLIP expression and low AKR1C1, ERβ and
Sp3 expression. AKR1C1/ERβ activation induces apoptosis
by downregulating c-FLIP expression, providing a new
approach for the treatment of prostate cancer [17]. Our results
showed that an esophageal cancer cell line overexpressing
AKR1C was more sensitive to EDHB-induced cell death.
However, in the AKR1C subfamily, AKR1C1/C2–AKR1C4
share a high degree of homology. In particular, the homology
between AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 is 98%, with only seven
different amino acids. To analyze which AKR1C protein
increases EDHB-induced cell death in ESCC, we utilized
a quantitative method, mTRAQ-based multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM), to measure human AKR1C levels after
EDHB treatment.
When combined with the newly released mTRAQ
reagent, a non-isobaric variant of the iTRAQ tag that is
available in two versions, the MRM approach enables the
absolute quantification of peptides and proteins via isotopedilution mass spectrometry. The method is conceptually
similar to Western blotting but differs substantially in
implementation, assay reliability, and the quality of the results.
A Western blot essentially depends on antibody specificity.
MRM is a better alternative for quantifying protein abundance
using liquid chromatography (LC) or SDS-PAGE to separate
proteins, especially when a suitable antibody is unavailable
and highly precise quantification is necessary; Zhang et al.
employed this method to quantitate the levels of AKR1A1,
AKR1C1/C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, AKR1B1, and AKR1B10
in seven different cancer cell lines and to ascertain the absolute
quantities of all proteins in each cell line [18–19]. In MRM,
the mass spectrometer (MS) is set to monitor only specific
mass/charge (m/z) values; as a consequence, the probability of
detecting low levels of a peptide as part of a complex mixture
is much higher [20]. Thus, MRM has been the method of
choice for the quantification of similar proteins, especially
when a suitable antibody is not available.
This study utilized an MRM assay to confirm
that AKR1C1/C2 are involved in the EDHB-induced
inhibition of esophageal cancer cell proliferation. EDHB
was used as a substrate of AKR1C1/C2, and KYSE 180
cells overexpressing AKR1C1/C2 were more sensitive to
EDHB, which potentially provides guidance for the use of
EDHB for the treatment of esophageal cancer.

RESULTS
High levels of AKR1C enhanced the sensitivity of
ESCC cells to EDHB
To analyze AKR1C expression in different ESCC
cells, total protein was extracted from KYSE 30, KYSE 140,
KYSE 150, KYSE 170, KYSE 180, KYSE 410 and KYSE
510 cells. Western blot analysis showed that AKR1C was
expressed at higher (KYSE 180) or lower (KYSE 510) levels

in certain ESCC cell lines (Figure 1A). KYSE 180 and KYSE
510 cells were then treated with varying concentrations of
EDHB, and the effect of AKR1C on the EDHB-induced
inhibition of ESCC cell proliferation was evaluated. Two
days after treatment, EDHB inhibited ESCC (KYSE 180 and

KYSE 510) cell proliferation by more than 50% compared
with the effect in control cells. The EDHB-induced inhibition
of the proliferation of both cell lines was dose dependent; an
increasing EDHB concentration evoked a greater reduction
in cell growth (Figures 1B and 1C). Additionally, EDHB

inhibited ESCC cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner
(Figures 1D and 1E). Based on statistical calculations, the
estimated IC50 of EDHB was 32.1 μg/ml in KYSE 180 cells
and 74.8 μg/ml in KYSE 510 cells (Figure 1F). Thus, EDHB
inhibited the proliferation of ESCC cells with either high or
low AKR1C expression. To examine the role of AKR1C in
the EDHB-induced inhibition of ESCC cell proliferation,
KYSE 180 and KYSE 510 cells were treated with the same
concentration of EDHB for 48 h; the inhibition of cell
growth was greater in KYSE 180 cells than in KYSE 510
cells (Figure 1F). Western blot analysis revealed that AKR1C
levels increased in KYSE 180 cells after prolonged treatment
with 40 μg/ml EDHB but remained unchanged in KYSE 510
cells treated with 80 μg/ml EDHB (Figure 1G). These results
showed that KYSE 180 cells, which express high AKR1C
levels after EDHB treatment, were clearly more sensitive to
EDHB and that AKR1C expression increased with prolonged
EDHB treatment.

by Western blot (Figure 3A). The effects of different
concentrations of siAKR1C1/C2 537 were determined
by Western blotting (Figure 3B). A total of 50 pmol of
siAKR1C1/C2 537 or siAKR1C1/C2 630 was selected
based on the most efficient AKR1C1/C2 knockdown. After
treatment with siAKR1C1/C2 537 or siAKR1C1/C2 630,
the sensitivity of ESCC cells to EDHB was investigated;
the EDHB-induced inhibition of cell proliferation
was significantly reduced by different siAKR1C1/C2
constructs (Figures 3C and 3D), indicating that AKR1C1/
C2 promoted the EDHB-induced inhibition of ESCC cell
proliferation.

AKR1C1/C2 increased EDHB-induced
esophageal cancer cell apoptosis
Overexpression of AKR1C1/C2 increased the
EDHB-induced inhibition of esophageal cancer cell
proliferation. To further investigate the corresponding
mechanism, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining
was performed to detect apoptotic KYSE 180 and KYSE
510 cells after EDHB treatment for 48 h. The proportion
of late apoptotic EDHB-treated KYSE 180 cells was
significantly higher than that of EDHB-treated KYSE 510
cells (57.5% vs. 9.2%). There was a significant difference
before and after EDHB treatment in KYSE 180 cells,
but not in KYSE 510 cells (P < 0.01; Figure 4A). The
proportion of apoptotic KYSE 180 cells was significantly
higher than that of KYSE 510 cells after EDHB treatment
(P < 0.01). To further evaluate KYSE 180 cell apoptosis,
Western blotting was performed to examine caspase-3
and caspase-9 activation after EDHB treatment. The
activated fragments of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were
detected in KYSE 180 cells at 24 h after EDHB treatment,
indicating apoptosis (Figure 4B). Caspase-3 and caspase-9
expression was lower in KYSE 510 cells than in KYSE
180 cells. Weak expression of cleaved caspase-9 was
detected after an 8 h treatment with EDHB (Figure 4B).
These results were consistent with the flow cytometry
analysis, which showed a reduced proportion of apoptotic
KYSE 510 cells after EDHB treatment.

Increased AKR1C1/C2 expression corresponded
with cell growth inhibition by EDHB as
determined by mTRAQ/MRM quantitative
analysis
The human AKR superfamily contains aldose
reductases, aldehyde reductases, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and steroid 5β-reductases. The AKR1C subfamily
includes four isoenzymes, AKR1C1–AKR1C4, that share
a high degree of similarity. To determine which AKR1
isoenzyme was elevated in ESCC cells after EDHB
treatment, KYSE 180 and KYSE 510 cells were treated
with EDHB for 48 h, and the protein levels of AKR1C1/C2,
AKR1C3, AKR1B1, AKR1A1, and AKR1B10 were then
quantitatively analyzed by MRM. This method is more
accurate than Western blotting for protein quantification.
AKR1C1/C2 expression was elevated in KYSE 180 cells,
whereas there was no obvious change in KYSE 510 cells
after EDHB treatment. Furthermore, there was no significant
change in the amount of AKR1C3, AKR1B1, AKR1A1,
or AKR1B10 in KYSE 180 cells after EDHB treatment
(Figure 2A). These results indicated that KYSE 180 cells
overexpressed AKR1C1/C2 after EDHB treatment. Due to
the structural similarities between AKR1C substrates and
EDHB, we hypothesized that EDHB may be a substrate of
AKR1C1. Therefore, NADPH/NADP-dependent AKR1C1
reduction was investigated using EDHB as the substrate;
the absorbance at 340 nm decreased over time. Therefore,
EDHB is a substrate of AKR1C1 (Figure 2B).

AKR1C1/C2 promoted EDHB-induced
esophageal cancer cell autophagy
EDHB induced apoptosis in ESCC cells expressing
high levels of AKR1C1/C2. To determine whether
AKR1C1/C2 promotes EDHB-induced autophagy in
ESCC cells, autophagy-related proteins were analyzed
in EDHB-treated KYSE 180 and KYSE 510 cells. The
levels of the autophagy markers Beclin, Atg12, and
LC3-II were elevated in KYSE 180 cells at 12 h after
EDHB treatment, whereas no changes in these markers
were observed in EDHB-treated KYSE 510 cells
(Figure 5A). LC3 expression was analyzed by gray-slot
scanning; LC3-II levels increased in KYSE 180 cells
with prolonged processing time, but there was very low

siRNAs, and knockdown efficiency was determined

immunofluorescence revealed the presence of LC3 puncta
and high LC3 expression in KYSE 180 cells at 12 h after
EDHB treatment, but there were no significant changes

in KYSE 510 cells after EDHB treatment at the same
exposure intensity (Figure 5C). Taken together, these
results suggested that AKR1C1/C2 promoted EDHBinduced ESCC cell autophagy.

EDHB-induced inhibition of esophageal cancer
cell growth was augmented by co-treatment with
an autophagy inhibitor

inhibitors or other similar drugs are considered promising
agents for adjuvant therapy, with the ability to prolong the
anticancer efficacy of chemotherapy by two-fold [21]. In
this study, we found that the EDHB-induced inhibition of
ESCC cells was increased by co-treatment with varying
concentrations of 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy
inhibitor (Figure 6B).
Thus, increased levels of AKR1C1/C2 enhanced
the sensitivity of ESCC cells to EDHB. AKR1C1/C2
facilitated the induction of early autophagy and late
apoptosis by BNIP3 and NDRG1 in ESCC cells after
EDHB treatment, thereby promoting the EDHB-induced
inhibition of esophageal cancer cell proliferation.
Additionally, AKR1C1/C2 may act as a metabolic
enzyme with EDHB as a substrate to inhibit cell
proliferation. Finally, the EDHB-induced inhibition
of ESCC cells was increased by co-treatment with an
autophagy inhibitor.

Previous studies have shown that EDHB induces
apoptosis and autophagy in KYSE 170 cells by
upregulating the expression of BNIP3 and NDRG1 [13].
To examine whether AKR1C1/C2 expression promotes
cellular apoptosis and autophagy induced by BNIP3 and
NDRG1, Western blotting was conducted; after EDHB
treatment, BNIP3 and NDRG1 expression increased
with longer EDHB treatment times in KYSE 180 cells
but increased only after treatment for 4 h with EDHB in
KYSE 510 cells, which was consistent with the results
of the apoptosis analysis. These findings indicated that
AKR1C1/C2 facilitated the induction of apoptosis
and autophagy by BNIP3 and NDRG1 in esophageal
cancer cells after EDHB treatment (Figure 6A). AKR1C

cells were treated with 40 μg/ml EDHB. The MTT assay was performed after EDHB treatment for 1 or 2 days, and the ratio of inhibition
was determined relative to untreated cells (mean + S.E.M. for triplicate samples).

DISCUSSION

through organic solvent extraction, which yields a
compound with anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and
analgesic effects. EDHB has been identified in peanut
seed coat, wine, and tea leaves, and it exhibits relatively
low antioxidant activity [7–9]. The benzene ring of EDHB
contains two adjacent phenolic hydroxyl groups that
structurally resemble the two adjacent phenolic hydroxyl
groups in PAHs [15]. Recent research found that EDHB
is a monomer substrate analog of α-ketoglutarate that
inhibits collagen prolyl hydroxylase and prevents collagen
synthesis [21–22]. EDHB inhibits collagen secretion by
breast cancer cells and thus prevents tumor metastasis
[12]. As a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, EDHB completely

Esophageal carcinoma has a poor prognosis and
highly malignant behavior [5]. The majority of esophageal
cancer patients are diagnosed at intermediate and
advanced stages and respond poorly to chemotherapy [6].
Concurrent chemo/radiotherapy is currently the standard
of care for the nonsurgical management of advanced
esophageal cancer. For these reasons, additional adjuvant
therapeutics are needed for esophageal carcinoma
treatment.
EDHB is a phenolic compound that is mainly
derived from plant leaves and roots and can be obtained

[23], prevents corneal epithelial wound healing [24],
and treats ischemic diseases [25]. Additionally, Han et
al. observed cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and
a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential in
ESCC cells after EDHB treatment; these effects were
accompanied by late apoptosis induced by NDRG1 and
early autophagy induced by BNIP3. Furthermore, cDNA

microarray analysis revealed that the expression of
AKR1C subfamily members is elevated in ESCC cells
after EDHB treatment [13].
In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the key
members of the human AKR superfamily involved
in the EDHB-induced inhibition of cell proliferation
and confirmed their function during this process. Cell
proliferation was inhibited by EDHB in ESCC cells with

either higher (KYSE 180) or lower (KYSE 510) AKR1C
expression, and this inhibition occurred in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. The results indicated that AKR1C
overexpression increased the sensitivity of ESCC cells
to EDHB. The AKR superfamily includes 15 families
[26–27]; the human-derived AKRs include families 1,
6, and 7 [28–29]. Based on evolutionary conservation,
members with an amino acid identity greater than 60% are
defined as one subfamily [30]. In the AKR1C subfamily,
AKR1C1/C2–AKR1C4 share a high degree of homology.
In particular, the homology between AKR1C1 and
AKR1C2 is 98%, with only seven different amino acids.
To analyze which unique AKR1C protein was elevated
after EDHB treatment, the mTRAQ/MRM method was
used to quantify the human AKR family members for
which no specific antibodies are available. The results
revealed that AKR1C1/C2 expression was elevated in
KYSE 180 cells at 48 h after EDHB treatment. Based on
this result, we confirmed that AKR1C1/C2 are involved in
the EDHB-induced inhibition of ESCC cell proliferation.
Additionally, AKRs are metabolic enzymes that
use NADPH as a coenzyme to reduce carbonyl groups
into monohydric and dihydric alcohols. AKRs have a
wide range of substrates, including aldehydes, ketones,

monosaccharides, steroids, prostaglandins, bile acid
precursors, and chemical carcinogens and their metabolites
[31–33]. AKR1C members are mainly involved in steroid
hormone metabolism (AKR1C1/C2–3), prostate-related
hormone metabolism (AKR1C3), and bile acid metabolism
(AKR1C4). Moreover, AKR1C subfamily members
are critical enzymes for the detoxification of drugs and
toxins in the body. AKR1C1/C2 and AKR1C4 decreased
the cytotoxicity of aldehydes and cisplatin in the HCT15
colon cancer cell line [34]. AKR1C1/C2–AKR1C3 can
metabolize progesterone and tobacco carcinogens [35–36].
It was previously found that treatment of different oral
squamous cells with cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)
can increase the expression of AKR1C1/C2, AKR1C3,
and AKR1B10 [37]. PAHs, which are AKR1 substrates,
are the main type of chemical carcinogen in tobacco, and
they exhibit mutagenic and carcinogenic effects [38–41].
EDHB is an exogenous substance with a structure similar
to that of metabolic substrates of AKR1C (i.e., PAHs) [15].
We analyzed AKR1C1 activity and confirmed that EDHB
acts as a metabolic substrate of AKR1C1 and increases the
sensitive of ESCC cells to EDHB. To further demonstrate
the role of AKR1C1/C2 in the EDHB-induced inhibition
of ESCC cell proliferation, AKR1C1/C2 were depleted

using different siRNAs, which significantly attenuated the
inhibitory effect. Taken together, these results indicated
that AKR1C1/C2 may be involved in the cellular
metabolism of EDHB and increase the sensitivity of ESCC
cells to EDHB.
Han et al. previously observed late apoptosis
induced by NDRG1 and early autophagy induced by
BNIP3 in ESCC cells after EDHB treatment [13].
Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that
degrades proteins and cytoplasmic organelles by activating
a series of autophagy-associated genes (ATGs) and the
formation of autophagosomes. During autophagosome
formation, the cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3-I) binds
to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form the LC3-PE
complex (LC3-II), which is then recruited to the
autophagosome membrane. Therefore, conversion from
LC3-1 to LC3-II is a unique characteristic of autophagy.
In evaluating the function of AKR1C1/C2 in EDHBinduced ESCC cell death, we showed that LC3-II and
Beclin levels were elevated in KYSE 180 cells, which
express high AKR1C1/C2 levels, at 12 h after EDHB
treatment. Immunofluorescence revealed the presence
of LC3 puncta in KYSE 180 cells at 12 h after EDHB
treatment. This phenomenon was absent in KYSE
510 cells, which exhibit low AKR1C1/C2 expression,
under the same conditions. In the endogenous apoptotic
pathway, caspase-9 is activated and further activates
caspase-3, thereby inducing apoptosis. Flow cytometry
analysis showed that the proportion of apoptotic KYSE
180 cells was higher than that of KYSE 510 cells after
treatment with the same concentration of EDHB. Western
blot analysis revealed that caspase-3 and caspase-9 were
activated in KYSE 180 cells at 48 h after EDHB treatment,
whereas the expression of these proteins was very low
in KYSE 510 cells. After treatment for 8 h with EDHB,
weak cleaved caspase-9 expression was detected. These
results were consistent with the flow cytometry analysis
that showed a smaller proportion of apoptotic KYSE 510
cells after treatment with EDHB. Thus, EDHB treatment
induced early autophagy and late apoptosis in KYSE
180 cells (high AKR1C1/C2) but not in KYSE 510 cells
(low AKR1C1/C2). Meanwhile, NDRG1 and BNIP3
expression increased in KYSE 180 cells with prolonged
EDHB treatment, whereas the expression of BNIP3 and
NDRG1 increased at only the 4 h timepoint in KYSE 510
cells, and there were no time-dependent changes, which
may be consistent with the apoptosis analysis. Thus,
this study demonstrated that AKR1C1/C2 contributed to
late apoptosis induced by NDRG1 and early autophagy
induced by BNIP3 in KYSE 180 ESCC cells after EDHB
treatment.
Another small inhibitor has emerged as a promising
therapeutic for the treatment of a range of genetically
defined hematologic malignancies. This inhibitor can
be potentially utilized to treat a broader spectrum of
human cancers that bear similar genetic and epigenetic

characteristics [42]. Our results showed that the inhibition
of cell proliferation by EDHB was more pronounced
when early autophagy was inhibited with 3-MA. This
observation provides an important contribution to the field
of precision medicine by clarifying appropriate treatments
for specific disease subtypes.
In summary, our observations indicated that
AKR1C1/C2 promoted the inhibition of cell proliferation
through either EDHB metabolism or BNIP3 and
NDRG1 expression and induced early autophagy and
late apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. EDHB is an
extracellular substance that structurally resembles PAHs.
AKR1C1/C2 levels increased in KYSE 180 cells, which
were more sensitive to autophagy and apoptosis after EDHB
treatment. These results indicated that esophageal cancer
patients with high AKR1C1/C2 expression may be more
susceptible to EDHB, thus providing potential guidance for
the chemoprevention and clinical treatment of ESCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
EDHB was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO) and dissolved in ethanol for biochemical
assays. Anti-AKR1C antibodies were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anticaspase-3 and anti-caspase-9 antibodies were procured
from Enzo Life Sciences (NY). Anti-LC3A/B and antiBeclin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Boston, MA). Anti-β-actin antibodies were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). AntiBNIP3 and anti-NDRG1 antibodies were purchased from
Abcam (Abcam, MA).

Cell lines and cell culture
The human ESCC cell lines KYSE 180 and KYSE
510 were a generous gift from Dr. Y Shimada (Kyoto
University, Japan). These cells were cultured in complete
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin
(100 mg/ml) at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing
5% CO2.

Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from KYSE 180 and KYSE
510 cells after treatment with 40 or 80 μg/ml EDHB,
respectively. Cells were washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), lysed with RIPA buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 150 mM NaCl, 1.0%
IGEPAL CA-630 (NP-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
and 0.1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor (500
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min, and
sonicated. The cell extract was prepared by centrifugation
21551

(12,000 rpm for 15 min). Subsequently, the protein
samples (25 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE
gels and transferred to Millipore polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes by electroblotting. The membranes were
blocked for 3 h with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS
and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight.
Western blot analysis was performed using the following
antibodies: anti-AKR1C, anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-3,
anti-NDRG1, anti-BNIP3, anti-Beclin, and anti-LC3.
Proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies and visualized with
Renaissance Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY).

by 35%-90% solvent B for 5 min. The MS parameters
for all the MRM experiments were as follows: ion spray
voltage (IS), 2500 V; curtain gas (CUR), 35.00; ion source
gas 1 (GS1), 20.00; collision gas (CAD), high; interface
heater temperature (IHT), 150; declustering potential
(DP), 100.00; entrance potential (EP), 10.00; and Q1 and
Q3, unit resolution. The spectra of 15 β-gal peptides were
assessed daily as QC for the LC-MS system. The MRM
methods and raw data were processed using Skyline [44],
an open-source software (http://skyline.maccosslab.org/).

Cell proliferation assay

DNA encoding full-length AKR1C1 (accession
number NM_001353) was obtained from OriGene and
cloned into pEX-N-His. Plasmids were transformed into
Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells to produce NH2terminally His6-tagged recombinant proteins. Protein
expression occurred without the need for induction
with isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial
cultures were pelleted by centrifugation (3,800 × g, 15
min), and the cells were disrupted by resuspension in
Bug-Buster reagent (Novagen) containing Benzonase
or DNase (Novagen) at 10 ml lysis reagent/400 ml
original culture. After incubation at room temperature
(RT) with shaking (150 rpm) for 25–30 min, the cell
debris was pelleted by centrifugation (48,000 × g,
30 min, 4°C). The cleared lysate was extracted using
HiTrap Benzamidine FF (high sub) from GE Healthcare
(Sweden).

Cloning, production, and purification of
recombinant AKR1C1 proteins

WST-8 assays for examining cell proliferation
were performed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
(Dojindo, Japan). Cells in the logarithmic growth phase
were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1×104 cells/
well. The cells were treated with varying concentrations
(0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, or 200 μg/ml) of EDHB for 24,
48, 72, or 96 h. Untreated cells were used as a negative
control. Culture medium (100 μl) was added to each
well. The cells were then incubated with 10 μl/well
of WST-8 in the culture medium for 3 h. Absorbance
values were detected at 450 nm using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader. The IC50
value (50% inhibition of cell growth) was calculated
graphically. Each column represents the average of
at least two independent experiments performed in
triplicate.

AKR1C1 enzymatic assays of EDHB reduction

AKR1C quantification via MRM assay

Human AKR1C1 enzyme assays were performed
at 35°C using 15 μg of recombinant protein in 50
mmol/l potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing
β-NADPH (15 μmol/l) and between 1.25 and 20 μmol/l of
EDHB. Initial velocities were determined by measuring
the change in absorbance of the pyridine nucleotide at 340
nm in a 1-ml volume.

The cells (KYSE 180 and KYSE 510) were
sonicated in lysis buffer (4% SDS, 7 M urea, 10 mM
EDTA, 10 mM PMSF, 10 mM DTT, and 0.1 M TrisHCl, pH 7.6). After sonication, the cell lysates were
centrifuged at 25,000 g, and the resulting supernatants
were reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 55
mM iodoacetamide. The treated proteins were digested
with trypsin according to the FASP protocol as described
by Mann [43]. Total protein content was measured
using the Bradford assay and confirmed by SDS-PAGE.
The MRM assay was performed on a QTRAP5500
MS (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA) equipped with a
nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA)
with a nanocapillary column (ID 75 μm × 20 cm, 1.7 μm
particles, 100 Å apertures, Waters, Milford, MA). The
peptides prepared from cell lysates were eluted with a
non-linear gradient program at 300 nl/min. The mobile
phases consisted of solvent A, 2% acetonitrile with 0.1%
aqueous formic acid, and solvent B, 98% acetonitrile with
0.1% formic acid. Peptides were separated in and eluted
with a gradient of 5-35% solvent B for 40 min followed

Analysis of cellular apoptosis
A total of 4×105 cells were plated in 6-well plates
and cultured overnight. The cells were treated with EDHB
at the IC50 EDHB for 24, 48, or 72 h and then harvested.
The cells were stained with Annexin-V and PI using a
cellular apoptosis detection kit (Biosea Biotech., Beijing,
China) according to the manufacture’s procedure. The
fluorescence intensity was detected by flow cytometry.

Immunofluorescence
Cells growing in the logarithmic phase were
