The approval of histone deacetylase inhibitors for
treatment of lymphoma subtypes has positioned histone
modiﬁcations as potential targets for the development of
new classes of anticancer drugs. Histones also undergo
phosphorylation events, and Haspin is a protein kinase the
only known target of which is phosphorylation of histone
H3 at Thr3 residue (H3T3ph), which is necessary for
mitosis progression. Mitotic kinases can be blocked by
small drugs and several clinical trials are underway with
these agents. As occurs with Aurora kinase inhibitors,
Haspin might be an optimal candidate for the pharmacological development of these compounds. A highthroughput screening for Haspin inhibitors identiﬁed the
CHR-6494 compound as being one promising such
agent. We demonstrate that CHR-6494 reduces H3T3ph
levels in a dose-dependent manner and causes a mitotic
catastrophe characterized by metaphase misalignment,
spindle abnormalities and centrosome ampliﬁcation. From
the cellular standpoint, the identiﬁed small-molecule
Haspin inhibitor causes arrest in G2/M and subsequently
apoptosis. Importantly, ex vivo assays also demonstrate
its anti-angiogenetic features; in vivo, it shows antitumor
potential in xenografted nude mice without any observed
toxicity. Thus, CHR-6494 is a ﬁrst-in-class Haspin
inhibitor with a wide spectrum of anticancer effects that
merits further preclinical research as a new member of the
family of mitotic kinase inhibitors.

Introduction
The initiation and progression of cancer are now
assumed to involve not only genetic alterations but also
disruption of epigenetic patterns (Jones and Baylin,
2007; Berdasco and Esteller, 2010). The cancer epigenome is characterized by characteristic changes in DNA
methylation and histone modiﬁcation patterns (Jones
and Baylin, 2007; Berdasco and Esteller, 2010). Unlike
genetic mutations, DNA methylation and histone
modiﬁcation marks are potentially reversible by the
use of drugs that target the epigenetic enzymes (Jones
and Baylin, 2007; Berdasco and Esteller, 2010). In this
regard, inhibitors of histone deacetylases and DNAdemethylating agents have been developed and approved for use in the therapy of hematological
malignancies, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Lane
and Chabner, 2009; Marks, 2010) and myelodysplastic
syndrome (Bryan et al., 2010; Götze et al., 2010),
respectively. However, these drugs have so far shown
limited activity against solid epithelial tumors (Graham
et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2009). Thus, it is necessary to
search for new drugs and pathways that target the
epigenetic machinery and might therefore be useful for
treating a wide spectrum of human tumors.
An interesting possibility is the discovery of compounds that target histone phosphorylation, a posttranslational modiﬁcation of these proteins that is
involved in mitotic functions, particularly in the
phosphorylation of serine 10 (H3S10ph) and threonines
3 (H3T3ph) and 11 (H3T11ph) of histone H3 (Kouzarides, 2007). Kinases can be blocked by small molecules
and, recently, mitotic kinases such as Cdks (cyclindependent kinases) (Vassilev et al., 2006; Malumbres
et al., 2008), Polo-like-kinases (Johnson et al., 2007;
Gleixner et al., 2010) and Aurora kinases (Harrington
et al., 2004; Girdler et al., 2006) have been studied as
potential targets for cancer therapy with fewer side
effects than traditional cytotoxic drugs. The case of
Aurora kinase B is particularly interesting because this
enzyme phosphorylates H3Ser10 and is associated
with microtubules during chromosome movement and
segregation. Importantly, Aurora kinase B inhibitors are

under study in several clinical trials (Dar et al., 2010).
Thus, in a similar manner, we concentrated our efforts
on developing small-molecule inhibitors of another
enzyme that phosphorylates histones, Haspin (Haploid
Germ Cell-Speciﬁc Nuclear Protein Kinase) (Dai et al.,
2005; Dai et al., 2006; Dai et al., 2009).
Haspin is a kinase that speciﬁcally phosphorylates
histone H3 at threonine 3 (H3T3ph) (Dai et al., 2005,
2006, 2009). Haspin function is critical in mitosis,
favoring chromosome cohesion, metaphase alignment
and progression though the cell cycle (Dai et al., 2005,
2006, 2009). These properties lead us to consider that
inhibitors of Haspin can be efﬁcient anti-mitotic
compounds. In addition, inhibition of Haspin might
have fewer undesirable side effects than other drugtargeted mitotic kinases because it belongs to a protein
kinase family that diverges from other human kinases
(Higgins, 2001; Eswaran et al., 2009; Villa et al., 2009)
and it has only one known target: H3T3 phosphorylation (Dai et al., 2005; Dai et al., 2006; Dai et al., 2009).
As with other mitotic kinases, its function is related to
proliferating cells, and we expect that inhibitor compounds will not affect non-proliferating cells. The ﬁrst
small-molecule inhibitors of Haspin have recently been
identiﬁed by high-throughput screening using a homogeneous time-resolved ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) assay, but in vivo assays have not been
performed (Patnaik et al., 2008; Cuny et al., 2010).
Herein, we describe a new small-molecule inhibitor of
Haspin, CHR-6494, with powerful antitumoral activity
in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.
Results
Library screening for Haspin inhibitors
An initial high-throughput radiometric enzymatic
Haspin kinase assay based on the incorporation of
radioactivity from [g-33P]-ATP into histone H3 in a
homogeneous FlashPlate 384-well format (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK) using a library of 117 995 compounds
screened at 10 mM was developed (BioFocus DPI,
Allschwill, Switzerland). A total of 1271 compounds
from the screening (having >50% inhibition) were
retested in duplicate and 591 showed conﬁrmed activity.
Cluster and physical property analyses of these hits
highlighted 125 compounds as being suitable for IC50
evaluation and purity analysis. On the basis of doseresponse results and molecular similarity studies, a
further 456 compounds were identiﬁed from the
BioFocus DPI compound collection and commercial
sources for hit expansion IC50, and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry purity measurements.
From the results for compounds with a purity >70%,
123 compounds were identiﬁed with an IC50 o10 mM.
Several hit series were identiﬁed in this exercise
and three were selected for hit-to-lead studies. Two
of these series, while maintaining Haspin kinase inhibition, performed poorly in cell-based assays; hence,
a series of imidazopyridazines were chosen for
further optimization. CHR-6494 (3-(1H-indazol-5-yl)-

N-propylimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-6-amine) (Figure 1a)
was identiﬁed as a compound having promising Haspin
kinase and cell proliferation-inhibitory properties
that merited further detailed biological and antitumor
investigation.
CHR-6494 is a potent inhibitor of histone H3T3
phosphorylation that has anti-proliferative effects
in human cancer cells
The next step was to show that the CHR-6494
compound was indeed an active Haspin inhibitor with
important biological effects, such as inhibition of cell
proliferation. To this end, we chose the initial biological
model of human cancer cell lines, in which three of the
best recognized examples, namely HeLa (cervical),
HCT-116 (colon) and MDA-MB-231 (breast) were
selected. CHR-6494 inhibited histone H3T3 phosphorylation in the three cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner as shown by western blot (Figure 1b) and
immunoﬂuorescence (Figure 1c). The diminished H3T3
phosphorylation levels upon CHR-6494 treatment were
not associated with downregulation of the total content
of the Haspin protein, the enzyme targeted by the drug
(Figure 1d). The use of CHR-6494 did not modify
H3S10 and H328 phosphorylation levels (Figure 1d),
two sites that are not phosphorylated by Haspin,
emphasizing the enzyme speciﬁcity of the identiﬁed
inhibitor. The speciﬁcity of CHR-6494 for Haspin was
further conﬁrmed by analysis of the enzymatic inhibitory capacity of the compound in a panel of 27 protein
kinases, including Aurora B kinase. Using a FRET
assay based on the differential sensitivity of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides to protein
cleavage (Z0 -LYTE Kinase Assay, Invitrogen), we
observed that the IC50 value for Haspin was 2 nM,
whereas for all other protein kinases, it was in the mM
range (Supplementary Table 1).
Once the biochemical effects of CHR-6494 as a
Haspin inhibitor had been conﬁrmed, we assessed its
effect on cancer cell biology. Using the XTT ((2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide)) assay to measure cell viability in the three
described cancer cell lines, we observed that CHR-6494
inhibited cancer cell growth dose dependently
(Figure 2a). The IC50 values were within the same
range: 500 nM for HCT-116, 473 nM for HeLa and
752 nM for MDA-MB-231. Interestingly, IC50 sensitivity
to this ﬁrst-in-class Haspin inhibitor compound is in the
same range as that of other anticancer compounds that
target histone modiﬁcations, such as inhibitors of
Aurora kinases A and B (Carpinelli and Moll, 2008)
and histone deacetylase (Zubia et al., 2009). The IC50
values upon CHR-6494 treatment for the Wi-38 human
diploid cell line derived from normal embryonic lung
tissues doubled those obtained for cancer cells
(IC50 ¼ 1059 nM) (Supplementary Figure 1), highlighting
a higher cell-viability effect on cancer cells rather than
on just proliferating cells. To further show that the effect
on cell viability of the drug was mediated by the
inhibition of Haspin, we overexpressed the protein in
HeLa cells and observed a partial rescue from the effects

of the compound: Haspin-transfected HeLa cells had an
increased IC50 value in comparison with control HeLa
cells (Supplementary Figure 2).
The described inhibition of cell proliferation induced
by CHR-6494 was associated with the induction of cellcycle arrest at G2/M in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2b) and subsequent apoptosis (Figure 2c). The
cell cycle was assessed with propidium iodide (PI)stained cells (distribution of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M
phases) by ﬂow cytometry. Annexin V-ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate/PI double staining was used to detect
cell apoptosis. Upon CHR-6494 administration, the
basal 8–15% of cells in G2/M observed in carrier control
(dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO))-treated cells increased
to 30–50% (Figure 2b), indicating that progression
through mitosis was delayed. Upon withdrawal of
CHR-6494 treatment for 24 and 48 h, the HCT-116 line
retained 50% of cells in G2/M arrest, suggesting a
prolonged effect of the drug. Related to the induction of

The inhibition of histone H3T3 phosphorylation induced
by CHR-6494 causes a mitotic catastrophe
The knowledge that phosphorylation of H3T3 by
Haspin is required for correct chromatid cohesion and
metaphase alignment (Dai et al, 2005; Dai et al. 2006;
Dai et al. 2009), and our ﬁnding that the Haspin
inhibitor blocks normal progression through the cell
cycle, led us to consider the effects of possible mitotic
spindle and centrosome defects upon CHR-6494 treatment. Immunoﬂuorescence data had already conﬁrmed
that, in control-treated cells, the H3T3ph signal is

combined with histone H3S10ph staining, a marker of
mitosis (Figure 3c). We observed that carrier-treated
cells had two centrosomes in every stage of the mitotic
cell cycle in the three studied lines (Figure 3c). However,
the number of centrosomes increased with the use of
increasing concentrations of the Haspin inhibitor
(Figure 3c). To conﬁrm that the observed centrosome
ampliﬁcation was not an effect of centrosome reorganization due to aberrant spindle conﬁguration, we
calculated the number of centrosomes in the prophase
just before spindle formation (Figure 3d). Treatment
with the Haspin inhibitor also increased the number of
centrosomes in the prophase (Figure 3d). Thus, CHR6494 caused an abnormal duplication of centrosomes
that it is dose dependent.
In addition to centrosome ampliﬁcation, the chromosomes of CHR-6494-treated cells had other important
aberrant structures in the metaphase and anaphase, such
as wider chromatids (Figures 1c, 3a and 3b), which were
probably associated with defects in condensation and/or
cohesion. There are several checkpoint controls that
function to safeguard the genome by limiting progression until events have been properly concluded and, for
example, the spindle checkpoint proteins (such as Mad1,

% anaphase/mitosi

present in the chromosomes of mitotic cells, a mark that
decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon CHR-6494
treatment (Figure 1c). However, the use of the Haspin
inhibitor also had an important effect on the morphology of mitotic spindle and centrosome structure of
cancer-treated cells. Immunoﬂuorescence assays with
anti-a-tubulin showed that control cells displayed
normal bipolar mitotic spindles with chromosomes
correctly aligned along the metaphase plate in the three
cancer cell lines (Figure 3a). On the other hand, CHR6494-treated cells exhibited an abnormal mitotic spindle
with large defects in chromosomal alignment, such as
the existence of multi-polar spindle morphology in the
three cancer cell lines (Figure 3a). Cells displaying
aberrant spindles did not progress through the anaphase, and the percentage of cells in the anaphase
decreased in a CHR-6494 dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3b).
The abnormal spindles observed upon CHR-6494
treatment might have been a consequence of defects in
centrosome duplication (Thompson et al., 2010). Thus,
we analyzed the number of centrosomes in HeLa, HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells by immunostaining with
anti-g-tubulin, a protein localized in the centrosomes,

Figure 4 CHR-6494 treatment upregulates the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BUB1 (a) and the marker of mitotic arrest cyclin
B1. (b) Western blots and quantiﬁcation of the levels of cyclin B1 and BUB1 are shown in control and CHR-6494-treated cells.

Mad2, BUB1, Bub3 and BubR1) examine the alignment
and tension of chromosomes in the mitotic spindle
before initiation of the anaphase (Musacchio and
Salmon, 2007). These mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins might arrest cells in the metaphase by suppressing
Cdc20, a protein required to trigger ubiquitination and
consequent degradation of cyclin B (Nilsson et al.,
2008). This degradation allows separase activation,
which triggers the separation of sister chromatids
(Stemmann et al., 2006). To investigate whether Haspin
inhibition by the CHR-6494 compound also caused
misregulation of checkpoints, we analyzed the levels and
nuclear localization of the key spindle assembly
checkpoint protein BUB1 and the marker of mitotic
arrest cyclin B1. Western blot experiments demonstrated
that BUB1 and cyclin B1 were both upregulated in the
three cancer cell lines upon CHR-6494 treatment
(Figure 4). These results indicate that the mitotic spindle
checkpoint mediated by BUB1 undergoes activation
before progression to the anaphase to try to correct the
aberrant spindle caused by the Haspin inhibitor. This
event is followed by an arrest in G2/M (Figure 2b) and
marked by the observed upregulation of cyclin B1 levels.
CHR-6494 inhibits angiogenesis ex vivo and tumor
growth in xenografted mice
The current development of efﬁcient anticancer drugs
must take into account all the crucial steps in tumor
development and metastasis, among them the targeting
of new blood vessel formation (Folkman, 2007). In this
regard, other epigenetic drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors have shown anti-angiogenic potential
(Kim et al., 2001; Aizpea et al., 2009), although this has
yet to be fully explored. Thus, we speculated whether the
newly identiﬁed Haspin inhibitor could act as a blocking
agent against angiogenesis. We found that CHR-6494
was an inhibitor of angiogenesis in the ex vivo chicken
embryo aortic arch ring assay (Figure 5a). At a concentration of 1 mM CHR-6494, there is a 70% reduction of the
sprouting vessel area induced by the pro-angiogenic basic
Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF). Thus, the identiﬁed

Haspin inhibitor, in addition to its anti-proliferative and
proapoptotic features, has an anti-angiogenic capacity
that could be useful for therapeutic purposes.
We transferred our experiments from the in vitro and
ex vivo assays described above to the in vivo setting in a
mouse model. The antitumor activity of CHR-6494 was
evaluated using HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells
xenografted in nude mice. Dose-dependent tumor
growth inhibition was demonstrated upon subcutaneous
administration of CHR-6494 (Figure 5b). Interestingly,
if we ceased administration of the Haspin inhibitor, the
tumor started to regrow (Figure 5b), demonstrating that
the anti-proliferative effect was caused by the presence
of CHR-6494. Histopathological analyses revealed no
abnormality in any of the normal mouse tissues studied
(Figure 5c), and the body weight of CHR-6494-treated
mice did not change during the treatment period
(Figure 5d), implying the lack of toxicity of the drug
under the described conditions.
Overall, our results indicate that the CHR-6494
compound is a ﬁrst-in-class Haspin inhibitor that blocks
H3T3ph, causing mitotic spindle and centrosome defects
that are associated with an arrest in G2/M and
subsequent apoptosis, in addition to demonstrating
ex vivo anti-angiogenesis and in vivo antitumoral effects.
Thus, CHR-6494 can be considered to be a new
candidate compound that warrants further development
for use in epigenetic cancer therapy.

Discussion
The CHR-6494 compound can be considered a ﬁrst-inclass inhibitor of the histone kinase Haspin that has
been characterized in vitro and in vivo. Only one report
has previously described other potential inhibitors of
Haspin that were identiﬁed in high-throughput in vitro
screening using an enzymatic assay (Patnaik et al., 2008;
Cuny et al., 2010). Herein, starting from a library of
117 995 compounds, we have comprehensively characterized the CHR-6494 small molecule as a speciﬁc

Haspin inhibitor that blocks H3T3 phosphorylation in
association with a characteristic spindle and centrosome
phenotype, causes arrest in G2/M, induces apoptosis
and possesses ex vivo anti-angiogenesis features and
antitumoral properties in a xenografted nude mice
model. These results might be relevant in at least two
ways: by improving our knowledge of the biology and
functions of the Haspin protein; and by providing
opportunities for carrying out further studies of the
safety and efﬁcacy of the compound in a preclinical
setting for future clinical trials in cancer therapy.
From the biochemical and cell biological standpoint,
the discovery of a speciﬁc Haspin inhibitor such as
CHR-6494 might enable its use as a powerful experimental tool with which we can understand the activities
Oncogene

of this protein. Haspin is a protein kinase conserved in
eukaryotes, where it associates with chromosomes in
mitosis, preferentially at the centromeres (Dai et al.,
2005, 2009, 2006). Haspin is required for phosphorylation of H3T3 to ensure proper chromatid cohesion and
metaphase alignment and for normal progression
through the cell cycle (Dai et al., 2005, 2009, 2006).
It has also been proposed that Haspin phosphorylation
of H3T3 at the centromere facilitates Aurora B
activation (Rosasco-Nitcher et al, 2008). Very recently,
the mechanism of Haspin action has been revealed in
three studies showing that histone H3T3 phosphorylation is a requisite for Aurora B, as it is positioned at the
centromeres in mitosis, and that Survivin, a member of
the chromosomal passenger complex, binds directly to

A small molecule inhibitor of Haspin

H3T3ph (Wang et al., 2010, Kelly et al., 2010). In
addition, it has been shown that H3T3 phosphorylation
cooperates with BUB1-mediated H2AS121 phosphorylation in targeting the chromosomal passenger complex
to the inner centromere to facilitate chromosome biorientation (Yamagishi et al., 2010). We discovered that
the loss of H3T3ph by CHR-6494-associated inhibition
of Haspin causes metaphase misalignment, spindle and
centrosome defects, as well as BUB1 and cyclin B1
upregulation, which mimics the phenotypes already
described using RNA interference against Haspin (Dai
et al., 2005, 2006, 2009). These results indicate that
CHR-6494 is a useful tool for learning about the
physiological role of Haspin and avoids problems
associated with the use of RNA interference to understand its role in tumorigenesis.
For the future development of Haspin inhibitors in
the clinical arena, we show herein that CHR-6494 has a
mechanism of action similar to that of other developed
inhibitors of mitotic kinases, such as Aurora A and
Aurora B kinases (Dar et al., 2010) or Polo-like kinase
(Macurek et al., 2009; Gleixner et al., 2010; Chopra
et al., 2010): the phenotype in mitosis is associated with
cessation of cell proliferation, G2/M cell-cycle arrest,
activation of spindle checkpoint proteins such as BUB1
and induction of apoptosis. However, the mitotic
catastrophe phenotype achieved by these drugs is not
identical. One example is that Aurora B kinase
inhibitors increase the polyploidy level due to endoreplication and the absence of cytokinesis (D’Alise et al.,
2008; Oke et al., 2009; Tao et al., 2009), which we did
not observe in CHR-6494-treated cells. Interestingly, the
IC50 concentration of CHR-6494 is in the range of 0.5–
1.0 mM, which is also similar to that observed in the
aforementioned cell proliferation inhibitors. Therefore,
CHR-6494 is a member of the new generation of antimitotic compounds that target components of the
mitotic machinery other than microtubules. Thus,
CHR-6494 avoids some of the adverse effects associated
with taxanes, which block cell-cycle progression by
binding to tubulin, causing undesirable cytotoxic effects
arising because of tubulin’s role as a cytoskeletal protein
that is essential for many other cell functions in addition
to mitosis. This new generation of anti-mitotic drugs
also targets centrosomes, like the compound K858,
which inhibits the mitotic kinesin Eg5 causing mitotic
arrest, monopolar spindles and monocentrosomes (Nakai et al., 2009), Griseofulvin, which inhibits centrosomal clustering (Rebacz et al., 2007) and Fostriecin,
which inhibits the phosphatase PP2A and induces
centrosome replication and aberrant mitotic spindles
(Cheng et al., 1998, Takeuchi et al., 2009), as well as the
inhibitors of Polo-like kinases (Chopra et al., 2010) and
Aurora A kinase (Dar et al., 2010).
Overall, our data suggest that CHR-6494 is a speciﬁc
inhibitor of the histone kinase Haspin that causes a
mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells, which explains its
signiﬁcant antitumor activity in the various experimental layers that we have assessed. Other mitotic kinase
inhibitors are already under clinical trial (Dar et al.,
2010) and the Haspin protein is overexpressed in

lymphomas (Rosenwald et al., 2001; Dave et al.,
2006); hence, further studies about bioavailability,
pharmacokinetics, dose administration and additional
cellular and animal models of cancer are warranted for
the preclinical development of CHR-6494 to evaluate
the potential of the compound as an anticancer drug.

Materials and methods
Library screening for Haspin inhibitors
A high-throughput radiometric enzymatic Haspin kinase assay
based on the incorporation of radioactivity from [g-33P]-ATP
into histone H3 in a homogeneous FlashPlate 384-well format
(Invitrogen) was used. In brief, 10 ml of compound in the assay
buffer was mixed with 20 ml Haspin enzyme (10 ng per well)
and histone H3 substrate (1.5 mg per well) and the reaction
started by the addition of 20 ml [g-33P]-ATP. After 75 min of
incubation at room temperature (RT), the reaction was
stopped by the addition of EDTA (ﬁnal concentration
33 mM). Wells were washed three times with 80 ml assay buffer,
and plates then sealed and counted in a TopCount Counter
(TopCount Counter, Meriden, CT, USA) for 30 s per well.
Cell culture
HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell line), HCT-116 (human
colon carcinoma cell line) and MDA-MB-231 (human breast
cancer cell line) were obtained from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured
in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (PAA Laboratories
GmbH, Pasching, Austria) containing stable glutamine, and
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (both antibiotics,
PAA Laboratories GmbH). Cells were grown at 37 1C in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For
transfection assays, pCMV6-XL5 (SC 314727, NM-031965.2True Clone cDNA Clone) was used for Haspin expression
(Origene, Rockville, MD, USA). In brief, cells were transfected
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer; 90–95% conﬂuent cells were transfected with
2 mg of DNA vector in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium
(Invitrogen) mixed with Lipofectamine, and cells were
incubated at 37 1C in a CO2 incubator for 18–48 h before
testing for transgene expression by western blot.
Drug, cell viability and kinase assays
CHR-6494 (Chroma Therapeutics, Oxfordshire, UK) was
supplied as a powder and dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO and
stored at 20 1C (10 mM stock). Cells were treated for 24, 48
and 72 h with the inhibitor or with DMSO as a control. Cell
viability was assessed using the colorimetric XTT assay (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded in 94-well plates
(SPL Lifescience, Gyeonggi, Korea) at a density of 4  104 cells
per well, and allowed to attach for 24 h. The medium was then
exchanged with others containing different drug concentrations (0.00110 mM). Eight wells for each concentration of the
CHR-6494 compound were used. At the corresponding time,
the culture medium was discharged, the XTT reagent was
added and the ﬁnal cell number and optical density were
determined. Dose-response curves were generated and cell
viability was evaluated after 72 h of treatment. The halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined using
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) software.
The analysis of the enzymatic inhibitory capacity of the
Oncogene

A small molecule inhibitor of Haspin
D Huertas et al

1416
compound in a panel of 29 protein kinases was developed
using a FRET assay based on the differential sensitivity of
phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides to protein
cleavage (Z0 -LYTE Kinase Assay, Invitrogen). In the primary
reaction, the kinase transfers the g-phosphate of ATP to a
single tyrosine, serine or threonine residue in a synthetic FRET
peptide. In the secondary reaction, a site-speciﬁc protease
recognizes and cleaves non-phosphorylated FRET peptides.
Phosphorylation of FRET peptides suppresses cleavage by the
development reagent. Cleavage disrupts FRET between the
donor (that is, coumarin) and the acceptor (that is, ﬂuorescein)
ﬂuorophores on the FRET peptide, whereas uncleaved,
phosphorylated FRET peptides maintain FRET. A ratiometric method, which calculates the ratio (the emission ratio)
of donor emission to acceptor emission after excitation of the
donor ﬂuorophore at 400 nM, is used to quantitate reaction
progress.
Apoptosis and cell-cycle analysis
Cells were seeded in 150-mm plastic culture dishes (SPL
Lifescience) at a density of 2.5  106 for HCT-116 and HeLa
cells, and 3.5  106 for the MDA-MB-231 cell line, and allowed
to attach for 24 h. The medium was then exchanged with
others containing different drug concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5 mM)
or with DMSO as a control. After 48 h, ﬂoating and attached
cells were collected, and washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Annexin V-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate/PI double
staining (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to
detect cell apoptosis according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 2.5  105 cells were resuspended in 250 ml
of binding buffer and 5 ml of Annexin V-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate. After a 10-min incubation at RT in the dark,
cells were washed, resuspended in 400 ml binding buffer and
stained with 1 mg/ml of PI. Positivity for Annexin V-ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate and/or PI was analyzed using a FACS
ﬂow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA). Data obtained from three experiments were
collected and mean and s.d. of the percentage of apoptotic cells
were calculated.
The cell cycle was assessed with PI-stained cells (distribution
of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M phases) by ﬂow cytometry.
Approximately 2  106 cells were ﬁxed in ice-cold 70% ethanol
overnight at 20 1C. Cells were subsequently washed and
resuspended in phosphate-citrate buffer. After 30 min, DNA
was stained with 25 mg/ml PI (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in a
reaction solution containing 50 mg/ml RNAse A (Sigma) for
30 min at 37 1C in the dark. Fluorescence emitted from the
PI–DNA was measured for individual cells using a FACS ﬂow
cytometer. Data from three experiments were collected and
mean and s.d. of the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase
were calculated.
Western blot analysis of H3 phosphorylation, Haspin, cyclin B1
and BUB1 expression
HCT-116, HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
500 nM of CHR-6494 compound (or 0.1% DMSO as a control)
for 48 h, and then harvested and washed twice with PBS.
Finally, they were centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min. Cell pellets
were resuspended in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS w/v,
63 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 2%
2-mercaptoethanol), sonicated and boiled for 5 min. Equal
amounts of protein extracts were loaded onto Tris–GlycineSDS gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(Whatman, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK).
Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer
(Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA), diluted 1:1 in tris-buffered
Oncogene

saline (TBS) for 1 h at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted
in Odyssey blocking buffer combined with 1:1 in TBS,
containing 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated O/N at 4 1C. Final
antibody concentrations were 1:5000 for H3T3ph (rabbit
PAb, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), 1:4000 for H3 (mouse
MAb, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), 1:500 for Haspin (rabbit
PAb, Abcam); 1:6000 for H3S28 (rat MAb, Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA); 1:8000 for H3S10 (rabbit MAb, Upstate,
Billerica, MA, USA), 1:10 000 for tubulin (rabbit PAb,
Abcam), 1:2000 for cyclin B1 (mouse MAb, Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA), 1:1000 for BUB1 (mouse MAb, Abcam)
and 1:4000 for Actin (mouse MAb, Sigma-Aldrich). After
primary antibody incubations, membranes were washed three
times (10 min each) with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20
at RT on a bench-top shaker. Secondary antibodies conjugated to IRDye 800CW (Li-COR) or IRDye 680 (Li-COR),
and then diluted to a concentration of 1:20 000 in Odyssey
blocking buffer combined 1:1 with TBS, containing 0.05%
Tween-20. Membranes were incubated with secondary antibody solutions for 1 h at RT in the dark on a bench-top
shaker. After secondary antibody incubations, the membranes
were washed three times (10 min each) with TBS containing
0.05% Tween-20 at RT, and then brieﬂy rinsed in TBS before
scanning. Membranes were scanned and analyzed using an
Odyssey IR scanner, running the Odyssey Imaging 3.0.
software. Scans were conducted to produce medium- or
high-quality images, with an intensity of 3.0–7.0 for both
channels. Antibody signals were analyzed as integrated
intensities of band regions in either channel.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
HeLa, HCT-116 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown on
coverslips and, after treatment, ﬁxed with freshly prepared 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT or with 100% cold
methanol for 10 min at 20 1C. Cells were mildly permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 2% bovine serum
albumin at RT for 1 h. Thereafter, incubation with primary
antibodies diluted in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin
was performed for 1 h (H3 phospho-Thr3 (JY235) monoclonal
antibody, Millipore, 04–746; a-tubulin monoclonal antibody,
Sigma, T6199; g-tubulin monoclonal antibody, Sigma, T6557;
anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10), Millipore, 06–570), washed
intensively and incubated with adequate secondary antibodies
labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 dyes (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen). After staining, coverslips were mounted in
Mowiol (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) with DAPI
(Sigma). Images were acquired using a confocal spectral Leica
SP5 microscope (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). Z-projection and
image processing were performed using ImageJ software
(Macbiophotonics, Hamilton, ON, Canada).
Chicken embryo aortic arch assay
We performed the chicken embryo aortic arch assay as
described previously (Martı́nez et al., 2004). Aortic rings of
B0.8 mm length were prepared from the ﬁve aortic arches of
13-day-old chicken embryos. Each aortic ring was placed in
the center of a well in a 48-well plate, covered with Matrigel
and incubated with bFGF or bFGF and CHR-6494 at either
500 nM or 1.0 mM concentration, or in the presence of medium
alone as a negative control. The plates were incubated at 37 1C
in 5% CO2 for 24 to 36 h, and microvessels sprouting from
each aortic ring were photographed under an inverted
microscope. The surface covered by the new vessels was
quantiﬁed by image analysis. Six independent rings were
measured per treatment. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to
identify statistically signiﬁcant differences among groups.

Xenografted nude mice
Athymic nu/nu male mice (Harlam, Correzzana, Italy), aged 4–
5 weeks, were used for tumor xenograft assays. Animals were
maintained in a sterile environment; their cages, food and
bedding were sterilized by autoclaving. The experimental
design was approved by the Bellvitge Biomedical Research
Institute (IDIBELL) animal facility committee. Mice were
anesthetized and tumor cells were injected subcutaneously.
In all, 3.5  106 exponentially growing HCT-116 cells diluted
in 250 ml of sterile PBS were injected subcutaneously in
each animal (n ¼ 30). Body weight was recorded and tumor
dimensions were measured twice weekly using digital calipers.
Tumor volume (in mm3) was estimated according to the
formula V ¼ D  d2/2, where D is the long axis and d the short
axis of tumor. When tumors reached an average volume
of 200 mm3 (15 days after injection), 24 mice harboring
homogeneous tumor sizes were randomized into two groups:
(1) control group (n ¼ 8) treated with vehicle (solution of
10% DMSO/20% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (SigmaAldrich); (2) treatment group (n ¼ 16) mice was diary treated
by intra-peritoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of CHR-6494 diluted
in a solution of 10% DMSO/20% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin in two cycles of ﬁve consecutive days for 15 days.
The treatment group was randomly divided into a short-time
response group (n ¼ 8), deﬁned by tumor weight at the moment
of killing of the control group, and a long-time response group
(n ¼ 8), deﬁned by tumor regrowth after treatment. Mice were

killed at the end of treatment, and tumors from both groups
were excised and weighted. The mean volume of tumor mass
was expressed as mean±s.e.m. for each mouse group, and
signiﬁcance was assessed by means of the Mann–Whitney Utest (GraphPad Prism software). Values of Po0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Upon killing mice, colon,
lung, liver and kidney tissues were obtained to analyze
endogenous toxicity by hematoxylin and eosin.
