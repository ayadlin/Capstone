Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Identification of somatic rearrangements in cancer genomes has accelerated through analysis of
high-throughput sequencing data. However, characterization of complex structural alterations and
their underlying mechanisms remains inadequate. Here, applying an algorithm to predict structural
variations from short reads, we report a comprehensive catalog of somatic structural variations and
the mechanisms generating them, using high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data from 140
patients across ten tumor types. We characterize the relative contributions of different types of
rearrangements and their mutational mechanisms, find that ~20% of the somatic deletions are
complex deletions formed by replication errors, and describe the differences between the
mutational mechanisms in somatic and germline alterations. Importantly, we provide detailed
reconstructions of the events responsible for loss of CDKN2A/B and gain of EGFR in
glioblastoma, revealing that these alterations can result from multiple mechanisms even in a single
genome and that both DNA double-strand breaks and replication errors drive somatic
rearrangements.

suggests that mismatch repair deficiency and specific mutagenic exposure such as smoking,
UV light and chemotherapy can be inferred from the mutational signatures for specific
tumor types (Greenman et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010; Pleasance et al., 2009a; Pleasance et
al., 2009b). Larger scale SVs including deletions, insertions, inversions, tandem
duplications, translocations and more complex rearrangements constitute another frequent
type of alterations that could alter normal gene function in tumors. Somatic SVs have been
characterized in several previous studies (Bass et al., 2011; Berger et al., 2011; Campbell et
al., 2010; Hillmer et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2009); however, which driving forces exist
for SV formation is still unclear.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Three main types of mechanisms known to cause SVs are homologous recombination, nonreplicative non-homologous repair and replication-based mechanisms (Gu et al., 2008;
Hastings et al., 2009b). Homologous recombination is the most common DNA repair
mechanism and is generally accurate, except when the pairing is between incorrect
homologous regions, as in non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Deficiency in
homologous recombination is believed to be a major source of cancer genome instability
(Hoeijmakers, 2001). For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are required for the homologydirected repair of chromosomal breaks, and loss of these two genes often results in genome
instability and cancer (Venkitaraman, 2002). Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a nonreplicative non-homologous repair mechanism that requires no homology and sometimes
can generate very short microhomology or small insertions at the breakpoint (Mahaney et
al., 2009). In addition, alternative end joining (alt-EJ) mechanism, also called
microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), can generate blunt ends, small insertions,
and, more frequently, microhomology at the deletion breakpoints (Bennardo et al., 2008;
McVey and Lee, 2008). Which factors are involved in alt-EJ is much less clear than it is for
NHEJ, and alt-EJ appears to be independent of the canonical NHEJ factors such as Ku70
and XRCC4 (Arlt et al., 2012; Bennardo et al., 2008). NHEJ has often been implicated in
tumor genomes, based on the very few overlapping sequences at breakpoints (Stephens et
al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2009). For complex rearrangements, a replicative mechanism
called fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) has been described (Lee et al., 2007),
which later was generalized to microhomology-mediated break-induced repair (MMBIR). It
has been proposed that the replication at the fork can stall and the polymerase can shift
template via microhomology to any nearby single stranded DNA, resulting in inversion,
tandem duplication, translocation, or more complex rearrangements (Hastings et al., 2009a;
Zhang et al., 2009). A recent assessment of SV formation (mostly focusing on deletions) in a
normal human population by the 1000 Genomes Project (Mills et al., 2011) did not address
the role of replication-based mechanisms. In cancer, a recent study hypothesized that
complex genomic rearrangements can arise from a single catastrophic event (Stephens et al.,
2011) driven by NHEJ; similar complex rearrangements have also been observed in
pathogenic germline alterations (Chiang et al., 2012). Another study suggested that multiple
amplifications in developmental delay and cognitive anomalous patients are generated by a
replication-based mechanism (Liu et al., 2011) since microhomology is frequently observed
at the breakpoints. However, there is no comprehensive study of the mechanisms that
underlie somatic SVs in cancer genomes, and many aspects are still poorly characterized,
including the forces that drive SV formation, relative contribution of different mechanisms
across tumor types, and whether additional mechanisms play a role.
In our analysis of somatic SVs across ten tumor types, non-homology-based and
microhomology-based mechanisms are consistently the dominant mutational mechanisms
responsible for genomic rearrangements, driven by DNA double-strand breaks and
replication errors. Importantly, multiple mechanisms sometimes act on a single gene in a
genome and two driving forces can act together on different part of a genome to create
mutations and promote tumorigenesis.

Results
Identification of germline complex deletion events using Meerkat

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To characterize the mutational spectrum of somatic SVs in cancer, it is important to identify
both simple (e.g., deletion, insertion, and inversion) and complex SVs at base-pair
resolution. The most common type of complex SV is a deletion with an insertion or
inversion at the breakpoint (Conrad et al., 2010; Kidd et al., 2010) generated by FoSTeS/
MMBIR. Previously, the identification of such events involved capturing and sequencing of
the segments adjacent to the deletion breakpoints (Conrad et al., 2010; Kidd et al., 2010).
Here, we predict both germline and somatic SVs directly from short read data, focusing on
complex events such as those generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR (an example shown in Figure
1A-D). This is made possible by a new algorithm called Meerkat (see Experimental
Procedures and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). With the base-pair resolution of
the breakpoints identified by our method, the mechanisms forming SVs are inferred based
on sequence homology at the breakpoints (Kidd et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2009; Mills et al.,
2011) (Figure 1E, see also Discussion). Identification of somatic SVs from short read data is
challenging due to several factors, including sequencing errors, GC content and other biases
in sequencing, ambiguous alignments due to repetitive sequences, a large number of
germline SVs, chimeric molecules generated during library construction, normal cell
contamination in tumor samples, and heterogeneity within tumor cell populations. The
distinguishing feature of our method is that it considers the configuration of multiple clusters
of discordant read pairs (read pairs in which the mapped reads are at unexpected distance or
orientation) to recognize complex events with high accuracy, in addition to efficiently
utilizing split, clipped, and multiple-aligned reads (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To verify the accuracy of our method, we applied Meerkat to two HapMap genomes
(NA18507 and NA12878) that have been sequenced at high coverage on the Illumina
platform and for which complex deletions have been previously reported (Kidd et al., 2010)
based on the sequencing of fosmid library with 40-kb inserts. We identified a total of 3,508
and 2,327 SVs, respectively (Table S1). Of our simple deletion predictions from NA18507
and NA12878, 91.4% (2102/2301) and 93.7% (1304/1391) were reported in the Database of
Genomic Variants (DGV10) (Iafrate et al., 2004) or the 1000 Genomes Project (Mills et al.,
2011), respectively, suggesting that the vast majority of our predictions were true events
(Figure S1). To further validate the events we detected, we randomly selected 49 events
across different types in NA18507 including 24 complex deletion events. We were able to
validate 48 events by PCR, including all complex deletions (Table S1). We identified a total
of 379 and 253 complex deletions in NA18507 and NA12878, demonstrating that our
method is far more sensitive than the previous effort, which reported 2 and 17 complex
deletions, respectively (Kidd et al., 2010). Therefore, with the Meerkat algorithm, we can
provide a more comprehensive spectrum of mechanisms of SVs in a genome. An example
for a complex deletion in NA18507 identified by Meerkat is shown in Figure 1A-D (the
same event was reported by Kidd et al. but in a different individual NA18956). Comparing
our predictions to the simple and complex deletions reported in Kidd et al., most of the
events we failed to identify occur in repetitive regions of the genome (Figure. S1 and Table
S2). This is expected since events reported by Kidd et al. were based on Sanger sequencing.
The examination of repetitive elements with short reads is a challenging problem that we
have addressed in a separate study (Lee et al., 2012).
Somatic structural variations across tumor types
We analyzed high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data from 140 individuals across ten
tumor types, including 14 colorectal adenocarcinoma (Bass et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012)
(CRC), 7 multiple myeloma (Chapman et al., 2011) (MM), 7 prostate adenocarcinoma

(Berger et al., 2011) (PR), 9 ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (Lee et al., 2012) (OV), 16
glioblastoma multiforme (Lee et al., 2012) (GBM), 19 hepatocellular carcinoma (Sung et al.,
2012) (HCC), 35 breast invasive carcinoma (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2012a) (BRCA), 19 lung squamous cell carcinoma (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2012b) (LUSC), 10 uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma (UCEC) and 4 kidney
renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) patients. With data from both tumor and germline
samples for each patient to distinguish germline and somatic variants, a total of 140 pairs of
genomes consisting of about half trillion (458 billion, ~35X coverage per genome on
average) paired-end reads (75-101 bp) were analyzed.
A total of 25,874 high-confidence somatic SVs (Table S3) were identified from the 140
cancer genomes (Table S4), ranging from 0 to 3160 per genome with an average of 185
(Figure 2A). To assess the accuracy of somatic SV predictions, we randomly selected 78 out
of 138 SVs in an ovarian tumor (OV0725), including two complex events with two
breakpoints each, and examined them in both tumor and normal tissues. By PCR, we were
able to validate 73 out of 80 (91%) breakpoints (Table S3) as somatic events.

The frequency of different types of somatic SVs in each sample is shown in Figure 2A. We
first note the remarkable variation in the number of SVs among individuals within and
across tumor types (the x-axis for each tumor type is scaled differently in Figure 2A). Some
genomes contain no SV (e.g., LUSC1078 and KIRC4856), while others show thousands of
SVs (e.g., BRCAA0J6); in a single tumor type, the number of SVs can vary by an order of
magnitude between individuals. Among the tumor types, breast tumors and lung squamous
cell tumors have significantly more SVs than any other tumors (P = 4.70e-23 and 6.68e-5,
respectively, ANOVA tests using a negative binomial model). The number of SVs identified
in breast cancer patients here (16,125 in 35 patients, ~461 per patient on average) is much
larger than those in previous studies (2,166 in 24 patients, ~90 per patient on average
(Stephens et al., 2009) and 2,476 in 22 patients, ~113 per patient on average (Banerji et al.,
2012)), due to increased sequencing coverage, sensitivity in the detection method, and
sample variation. Kidney cancer patients have significantly less SVs than other tumor types
(P = 1.74e-5, ANOVA test using a negative binomial model). In terms of event types,
translocations (57%) are the most abundant SV type, while deletions and tandem
duplications make up 25% and 17%, respectively. The proportions of different types of SVs
across different tumor types are highly variable (Figure 2A). For instance, the breast tumors
have significantly more intra-chromosomal translocations than other tumors types do (P =
1.22e-53, ANOVA test using a negative binomial model). There are also considerable
differences between individual genomes. For example, all rearrangements in a kidney
sample (KIRC5010) are deletions, while there are no deletions in a liver cancer (HCC13). In
non-tumor samples, each individual has about 3,000 germline SVs with deletions always
being the most abundant (~60%) (Figure S2A), similar to what we find in the HapMap
individual NA18507 (Figure 2A).
By pairing multiple clusters of discordant reads to predict complex events, we achieved a
better description of the nature of SVs than previously obtained. For example, in the PR0581
genome, a “close chain” pattern had been described to form the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
gene, involving C21orf45 (Berger et al., 2011). We identified two related events in this
genome. The first event is a 3 Mb deletion that causes the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. The
second event is a 74 bp deletion in the first intron of C21orf45 at which the 3 Mb deletion
from the first event was inserted. The copy numbers of the aforementioned regions were
unchanged, supporting the two events we predicted. Detailed descriptions of the events
involving CDKN2A/B, EGFR, and CDK4 are provided later.

Certain pathways, such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle pathways, are likely
to malfunction in order for the cell to generate and maintain the genomic rearrangements. To
investigate this, we identified mutations in genes that in above pathways caused by SVs as
well as single nucleotide variants (Bass et al., 2011; Berger et al., 2011; Chapman et al.,
2011; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012a; The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2012b). As expected, almost all patients have at least one gene altered in
at least one of these pathways (Table S5); nearly half of the mutations are caused by SVs.
Mutational mechanisms for somatic SVs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The number of deletions per genome ranges from 0 to 395, with an average of 46 (Figure
2B). Deletions are usually a result of DNA double-strand break repair. The mechanisms of
deletion formation are predicted as shown in Figure 1E (see the Figure 1E legend for
information on how mechanistic categories were assigned). In the cancer genomes we
studied, NHEJ (39%) and alt-EJ (41%) are the dominant mechanisms. This is in contrast to
the mechanisms in the HapMap genome NA18507 (Figure 2B) and non-tumor genomes
(Figure S2B), in which TEI is always the dominant mechanism, and the frequencies of
NHEJ and alt-EJ in germline deletions are about ~15% and ~22%, respectively. The
increased ratio of NHEJ to alt-EJ in somatic deletions compared to that in germline is
statistically significant (P = 1.41e-12, Wilcoxon’s paired rank sum test). We also find that
about 20% of the somatic deletions are complex deletions formed by FoSTeS/MMBIR
(Figure 2B), in contrast to ~5% for the germline deletions (Figure 2B and Figure S2B). The
mechanisms of somatic deletions are also variable across different tumor types and between
samples. For instance, some genomes have a notable portion of FoSTeS/MMBIR in somatic
deletions, while others have none (Figure 2B).
We identified between 0 and 2,999 inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations in the cancer
genomes with an average of 106 translocations per genome (Figure 2C). Again, NHEJ and
alt-EJ are the dominant mechanisms with alt-EJ being more abundant in most cases. A small
number of translocations are formed by FoSTeS/MMBIR with variable frequencies across
genomes. Breast cancer patients have significantly more translocations formed by alt-EJ
than other tumor types (P = 4.21e-19, ANOVA test using a negative binomial model). We
note that the proportion of translocations formed by NHEJ and alt-EJ are comparable in
most tumor types, but alt-EJ is much more prominent in breast tumors that have a large
number of translocations (>500). The reason for this difference in translocation formation in
those samples is not clear, but it may be due to an alteration in a specific pathway that
induces translocations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tandem duplications are known to result from unequal crossing-over (Edlund and Normark,
1981) or by FoSTeS/MMBIR (Hastings et al., 2009a). Short sequence homologies are
required for FoSTeS/MMBIR—the microhomology can be as short as 2 bp to allow new
DNA synthesis to start (Zhang et al., 2009)—while a larger degree of homology is required
for unequal crossing-over. Complex rearrangements, especially ones involving dosage gains,
are often driven by FoSTeS/MMBIR (Hastings et al., 2009a; Liu et al., 2011) as evidenced
by the microhomology frequently observed at the breakpoints. Events with no more than 10
bp insertions at breakpoints were classified as NHEJ since NHEJ is known to generate small
insertions at breakpoints (Haviv-Chesner et al., 2007). In HapMap (Figure 3) and other nontumor samples (Figure S3A and S3B), the majority of the breakpoints of tandem
duplications (73%) and complex deletions (71%) have microhomology that support the
MMBIR models. In contrast, the fraction of breakpoints with microhomology is
significantly less in somatic tandem duplications (46%) and complex deletions (52%) (P =
6.78e-19 and P = 1.09e-13, respectively, using Wilcoxon’s paired rank sum test; Figure 3,
Figure S3C and S3D). Although most of the germline tandem duplications and complex
deletions were generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR (Figure S3A and S3C), a small number have

no homology at the breakpoints. In somatic tandem duplications and complex deletions, we
do not observe homology at many breakpoints (Figure 3). Thus, we suspect that a templateswitching mechanism that does not require microhomology or another non-homology-based
mechanism is often utilized in somatic cells to form tandem duplications and complex
deletions.
Reconstruction of complex rearrangements in GBM patients
We are particularly interested in GBM genomes since several recurrent copy number
alterations we found are known to play an important role in tumorigenesis (The Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008). In our 16 GBM whole-genome datasets, 15
genomes have loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 10, 12 have homozygous
deletions of CDKN2A/B, 14 have EGFR amplifications, and 5 have CDK4 amplifications
(Table 1). We tested 26 SVs involving loss or gain of CDKN2A/B, EGFR and CDK4 and
validated 25 as somatic SVs by PCR (Table S3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the copy number changes in these regions have been documented previously based
on array data, the exact configuration of the rearrangements and the mechanisms underlying
those events are largely unknown. Using Meerkat, we not only ascertained the types of
events that generated the observed configuration but also gained insights into the
mechanisms by analyzing sequence homology at the breakpoints. It is interesting to note that
in both CDKN2A/B loss and EGFR gain, most tumor genomes have both arm-level and
focal loss/gain (Table 1). Out of twelve patients harboring CDKN2A/B loss, six have armlevel loss and focal deletions (Figure 4A), two have two independent focal deletions (Figure
4B), and four have complex rearrangements (Figure 4C). SVs responsible for CDKN2A/B
loss in other patients are displayed in Figure S5. Most (11 of 13) of the focal deletions were
generated by NHEJ, which suggests these alterations are mostly formed through erroneous
repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the 14 GBM genomes with EGFR amplification, most have more than one event
contributing to the copy gain: 9 with a chromosome arm gain, 8 with tandem duplication(s),
1 with a complex tandem duplication, and 8 with complex events. For GBM0155 (Figure
5A), three tandem duplications (1.6 Mb, 983 kb and 28 kb) involving EGFR were identified.
In GBM0145 (Figure 5B), EGFR is amplified by a 789 kb tandem duplication, but a
complex deletion was also found (deletion of a 417 kb fragment with insertion of a 50 kb
fragment in the breakpoint). From the copy ratios, it appears that this deletion only affects a
subset of the tandem-duplicated copies, suggesting that it happened during the tandem
duplication. The complex deletion may not have been generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR since
no microhomology was found at the breakpoints. Similarly, GBM0214 (Figure 5C) contains
a 59 kb tandem duplication and multiple subsequent rearrangements of various types in the
EGFR region that are exceedingly difficult to disentangle. SVs responsible for EGFR
amplifications in other patients are displayed in Figure S6.
In GBM0152, a 923 kb fragment covering EGFR (Figure 6A) is merged with two fragments
from chromosome 12 (a 5,620 bp fragment and a 286 bp fragment in inverted orientation)
and then tandem-duplicated (Figure 6B). Moreover, nearly 40 regions on chromosome 12
(including CDK4) are coalesced in an elaborate complex series of events with the copy
ratios of various fragments at approximately 40-fold, 75-fold and 110-fold gain (Figure 6C).
In this case, the three prominent copy ratios and all the amplified segments being connected
by discordant read pair clusters make it possible to disentangle the underlying events (Figure
6D). Based on the pattern of segments connected by discordant read pairs and the
corresponding copy ratio for each segment (Figure 6E), we present one possible coamplified unit (Figure 6F) that is consistent with all the observed copy ratios and discordant
read pairs while other compatible configurations are also possible. This single unit (Figure

Yang et al.

Page 7

6F), composed of dozens of fragments, was tandem-duplicated to reach a copy ratio of about
40.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While the complexity of the rearrangements in Figure 6C is reminiscent of chromothripsis
(Stephens et al., 2011), it is unlikely to be the case here; instead, it is likely to have been
generated by a replication-based mechanism. Chromosomes that have undergone
chromothripsis have copy numbers that oscillate between two levels. The complex tandem
duplications in our example have several distinct copy numbers, indicating that they are
more likely to be a result of a series of replication-based template-switching events. A single
unit of amplification contains multiple instances of the segment (junctions 2-4, 12-14, 14-20
and 18-29 in Figure 6F)—it is unlikely that at least two copies of chromosome 12 were
shattered at the same place and joined with the same segments at the exact breakpoints after
a “one-off” catastrophic event. Therefore, we suspect that certain junctions (such as 14-20 in
Figure 6F) were formed first by a template switching event, and then the resulting fragment
served as an additional template in subsequent switching events to form more rearranged
fragments.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Most of the GBM patients examined in this study have both EGFR gain, most likely through
a replication-based mechanism, and CDKN2A/B loss, mostly by NHEJ repair of DNA
double-strand breaks. Furthermore, in all tumor types, a significant portion of the focal
deletions was generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR in addition to the dominant NHEJ and alt-EJ
mechanisms. This suggests that cancer genomes are likely to have more than one driving
force (e.g., replication error and erroneous repair of DNA double-strand breaks) acting
together in the same individual to initiate different types of rearrangements in different parts
of the genome and provide advantageous mutations for cancer progression.
Double minute chromosomes and complex rearrangements

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Double minute chromosomes (DMs) are extra circular chromosomal DNA with neither
centromeres nor telomeres that can duplicate autonomously. They have been found in a
variety of solid tumors as well as in leukemia (Thomas et al., 2004). EGFR has been shown
to be amplified by DMs in glioma and glioblastoma (Vogt et al., 2004). All of the EGFR
amplifications we identified above are likely to be DMs since the amplified fragments in
DM loop structures would be predicted as tandem duplications. With paired-end sequencing,
we are not able to determine if the amplifications were tandem duplications on the same
chromosome or circularized as double minute chromosomes. In one patient, we identified a
deletion whose breakpoints matched the tandem duplication (Figure S6G), suggesting an
excision of the DNA fragment followed by circularization of that fragment, similar to the
excisions of amplified DM fragments reported based on FISH (Storlazzi et al., 2010; Van
Roy et al., 2006).
It was previously shown that most DMs that amplified EGFR in gliomas are a single
fragment circularized by a microhomology-based mechanism (Vogt et al., 2004), likely
FoSTeS/MMBIR (microhomology was detected at 6 out of 7 breakpoints), and subsequently
amplified by recombination to join multiple fragments into one larger circular DNA or by
rolling circle replication. The copy number of the amplified region we observed is the
average across many tumor cells; each cell or a sub-population of cells could have a
different number of the amplified unit. Most of the initial circularizations of DMs in
neuroblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma (Storlazzi et al., 2010) were also generated by
FoSTeS/MMBIR, with 23 out of 32 breakpoints showing either microhomologies or large
insertions. Similar to EGFR amplifications in glioma, most of the EGFR and CDK4
amplifications in GBM patients reported here can be explained by an initial circularization
of a single DNA fragment resulting from replication error; others can be explained by the
circularization of multiple DNA fragments. However, we observed more breakpoints

without homology than with microhomology (Figure 3), suggesting that some of these initial
circularizations were generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR but more were formed by nonhomology-based replicative mechanisms.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have reported a comprehensive catalog of somatic rearrangements in cancer, revealing
the diversity in the types of somatic SVs and the mechanisms that generate them across
different tumor types and individuals. Given the disruptive nature of some genomic
rearrangements and their role in promoting cancer progression, precise characterization of
the rearrangements and their mechanisms is crucial. While much of the work on structural
variations so far has focused on their impact on genes and the mutations occurring in intergenic regions have often been considered “passenger” events, recent work by the ENCODE
consortium (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012) has shown that the fraction of the
non-coding genome that plays a role in gene regulation is much larger than previously
thought. This suggests that, in addition to a direct impact on protein structure (e.g., by fusion
transcripts), other, perhaps more subtle types of misregulations may result from
rearrangements that involve non-coding regions (e.g., disruption of enhancer activity or
binding of a non-coding RNA). Thus, it is advantageous to know not simply whether a
genomic region is amplified or not but also where the amplified segments are located. At
some point in the future, improved DNA sequencing technology will accommodate much
longer reads (on the order of kilobases or longer) to make reconstruction of structural
alterations easier; in the meantime, innovative approaches such as the one we report here are
needed to dissect the evolution of the cancer genome based on short-read data.
It is important to note that assigning mechanisms to events based on sequence features at the
breakpoints is an inexact process. For instance, we found that NHEJ and alt-EJ contribute
the most to focal deletions and translocations. The events generated by alt-EJ tend to have
more microhomology than by NHEJ (Bennardo et al., 2008; McVey and Lee, 2008), but
there is no consensus cutoff for distinguishing NHEJ and alt-EJ (Arlt et al., 2012), as both
mechanisms can generate rearrangements with blunt ends, microhomology, or small
insertions at the breakpoints. In addition, events generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR frequently
have microhomology at the breakpoints. These ambiguities in the thresholds, however, are
unlikely to materially affect our comparisons of germline and somatic events or comparisons
across tumor types, since we apply the same criteria to all events. We also note that SVs
generated by NAHR typically require at least 100bp of homology (Liskay et al., 1987;
Waldman and Liskay, 1988); therefore we could not identify these SVs generate by NAHR
based on the short (≤100 bp) reads we have.

We found more microhomology-based mechanisms (alt-EJ and FoSTeS/MMBIR) for
germline SVs (e.g., deletions, tandem duplications and complex events) than for somatic
SVs, suggesting that those mechanisms may be suppressed in cancer cells. It is also possible
that DNA breakage and replication fork stalling are more frequent in cancer cells, and a nonhomology-based mechanism is the easiest way to repair. A similar trend was observed in
pathogenic germline rearrangements (Chiang et al., 2012), with less microhomology at the
breakpoints of pathogenic balanced translocations and inversions.
The driving forces behind large-scale genomic rearrangements have been less well
characterized than those for single nucleotide alterations. In addition to the chromosome
arm-level alterations (induced, e.g., by mutations in genes that maintain genome stability
(Solomon et al., 2011)), focal losses and gains of CDKN2A/B and EGFR in GBM patients
involved distinct mechanisms acting together on the same locus in the same genome. Why
multiple mechanisms act on certain regions of the genome repeatedly remains unclear. The

rearrangements we observe are a snapshot of the combined effect of bias in formation and
selection of the alternations in cancer genomes. It is possible that specific regions are biased
toward the formation of genomic rearrangement, driven by their genomic and epigenetic
features as well as their regulatory function (De and Michor, 2011a; De and Michor, 2011b;
Fudenberg et al., 2011). For example, the recruitment of specific proteins induced by
androgen can trigger DNA double-strand breaks which result in TMPRSS2-ERG gene
fusion in prostate cancer (Haffner et al., 2010). It is also possible that alterations occur
randomly for the most part and the fitness of the cell increases with certain alterations.
Further studies are needed to better understand the relationships between the driving forces
and their targets and how each step of the alteration confers growth advantage to the selected
clones.

Experimental Procedures
Identification of SVs using the Meerkat algorithm
In short, we predict SVs based on discordant read pairs and refine the precise breakpoints by
looking for the reads that cover the SV breakpoint junctions. Mutational mechanisms are
predicted based on homology and sequencing features at the breakpoints (Figure 1E) which
is adapted from Kidd et al. 2010. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more
details. The Meerkat package is available at http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Meerkat/.

Experimental validation of SVs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A set of SVs predicted by Meerkat was validated by PCR. PCR primers were designed using
Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) to amplify the predicted SV breakpoints. The
primer pairs were designed to produce a product under 10 kb for SVs of NA18507 or about
200 bp long for somatic SVs predicted in cancer samples. For NA18507, PCRs were run on
genomic DNA. For somatic SVs, PCRs were run on whole-genome amplified DNA of both
tumor and matched normal samples to ensure that the somatic SVs were found only in tumor
but not in the matched normal sample. Whole-genome DNA amplification was performed
with Sigma/Rubicon’s WGA kit per manufacturer’s instructions. For NA18507, five to ten
SVs were randomly selected from each event type and an SV was considered validated if the
predicted product across breakpoints was detectable in genomic DNA. For deletions with a
large insertion in the breakpoints, large insertions, deletions with an inversion in the
breakpoints, three PCRs were performed. Two PCRs were aimed at amplifying across the
two breakpoints and the third PCR was targeted to amplify the entire insertion or inversion
event if the insertion or inversion was <10 kb. An event was considered validated if all three
PCRs yielded products of expected sizes. If a PCR validation was not successful, two more
pairs of primers were attempted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) A complex deletion is predicted by three discordant clusters. The sequence in light blue
on the reference is deleted; the sequence in red on the reference is duplicated and inserted
into the deletion breakpoints. Three read pairs from the donor are shown above the donor
sequence. Three discordant read pairs mapped to the reference are shown above the
reference sequence.
(B) Reads covering the breakpoints of insertion. The breakpoints are covered by 27 and 11
reads, respectively (only four are shown for each). Reads matching different parts of the
reference genome are shown in the corresponding colors.
(C) Nucleotide sequences of the reads covering the breakpoints of insertion. Black and red
colors indicate the reads and the reference sequences that match each other and the grey
sequences indicate unmatched references. There are a 2 bp microhomology (shown in
purple) at the breakpoint on the left and a 9 bp insertion of unknown source (shown in dark
green) at the breakpoint on the right.
(D) Sequencing depth. Blue and red lines denote the predicted deletion and the predicted
insertion donor sites, respectively, showing that the copy number is consistent with the SV
call.

displays the number of SVs for one sample. The colored bar charts on the left show the
number of events scaled by the maximum number of events (as noted) in each tumor type.
The black bar charts on the right show the number of events for all patients on the same
scale. A HapMap genome (NA18507) is shown at the top as an example of germline events;
see Figure S2 for germline events for all patients. Most (59%) of the translocations in
NA18507 are TE insertions, as described previously (Lee et al., 2012), 18% are repeatrelated events including TE insertions not identified by Lee et al. 2012, and the remaining
ones might be events too complex to be identified by Meerkat.
(B) Frequencies of somatic deletion mechanisms. The order of the samples is the same as in

(B) Diagram of the resulting rearrangements. Three segments of DNA from chromosome 7
and chromosome 12 are merged into one and tandem-duplicated.
(C) Copy ratio and somatic rearrangements on chromosome 12. The three grey dashed lines
in copy ratio panel (bottom of this figure) denote copy ratios of 40, 75 and 110. The
rearrangements marked by “a”, “b”, “c” and “d” have approximately twice as many
supporting discordant read pairs as other rearrangements. These rearrangements are also
marked in (D), (E) and (F).
(D) The 14 Mb region of chromosome 12 shown in (C) was segmented according to copy
ratios. Each segment was re-scaled and assigned an identifier from 0 to 40. The
rearrangement marked with a black arrow is not involved in the amplifications of other
segments on chromosome 12, but is involved in the amplification of EGFR on chromosome
7 as displayed in (A).
(E) Each segment in (D) is shown as a numbered node connected by arrows and lines. Black
arrows connected by lines denote concordant connections. Ratios of segments are denoted
by the number of dots above the segment IDs inside each node. Non-amplified segments are
not shown. The connection marked with “e” (also marked in (F)) is a germline deletion.
(F) This diagram shows one possible solution on how segments are connected. Segments
with a white background are in an inverted orientation. Colored dashed lines denote
discordant connections while black lines denote concordant connections.
