Abstract
In a subset of patients with non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), lenalidomide promotes erythroid lineage competence and effective erythropoiesis. To determine the mechanism
by which lenalidomide promotes erythropoiesis, we investigated
its action on erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) cellular dynamics.
Lenalidomide upregulated expression and stability of JAK2-associated EpoR in UT7 erythroid cells and primary CD71þ erythroid
progenitors. The effects of lenalidomide on receptor turnover
were Type I cytokine receptor speciﬁc, as evidenced by coregulation of the IL3-Ra receptor but not c-Kit. To elucidate this
mechanism, we investigated the effects of lenalidomide on the
E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41. Lenalidomide promoted EpoR/
RNF41 association and inhibited RNF41 auto-ubiquitination,
accompanied by a reduction in EpoR ubiquitination. To conﬁrm
that RNF41 is the principal target responsible for EpoR stabilization, HEK293T cells were transfected with EpoR and/or RNF41

gene expression vectors. Steady-state EpoR expression was
reduced in EpoR/RNF41 cells, whereas EpoR upregulation by
lenalidomide was abrogated, indicating that cellular RNF41 is
a critical determinant of drug-induced receptor modulation.
Notably, shRNA suppression of CRBN gene expression failed to
alter EpoR upregulation, indicating that drug-induced receptor
modulation is independent of cereblon. Immunohistochemical
staining showed that RNF41 expression decreased in primary
erythroid cells of lenalidomide-responding patients, suggesting
that cellular RNF41 expression merits investigation as a biomarker for lenalidomide response. Our ﬁndings indicate that
lenalidomide has E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitory effects that
extend to RNF41 and that inhibition of RNF41 auto-ubiquitination promotes membrane accumulation of signaling competent JAK2/EpoR complexes that augment Epo responsiveness.

Introduction

Lenalidomide, a second-generation immunomodulatory drug
(IMiD), has greater potency and a more favorable toxicity proﬁle
than its parent, thalidomide (1, 5). Both lenalidomide and its
analogue, pomalidomide, promote erythroid lineage competence
and the expansion of primitive erythroid precursors in CD34enriched hematopoietic progenitors (6). In transfusion-dependent, lower-risk patients with MDS without chromosome 5q
deletion, lenalidomide restores effective erythropoiesis and red
blood cell transfusion independence in approximately 25% of
patients who are unresponsive to treatment with recombinant
erythropoietins (7). Gene expression proﬁling performed by Ebert
and colleagues showed that lenalidomide responders display
inherently lower expression of erythroid-speciﬁc genes and that
lenalidomide relieves repression of Epo-induced transcriptional
response, suggesting that lenalidomide modulates EpoR signal
capacity (8).
Recent investigations revealed that the IMiDs bind to and
inhibit the function of the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex,
which accounts for the teratogenicity of thalidomide and the
antiproliferative effects of lenalidomide in multiple myeloma
(9–12). We previously reported that lenalidomide inhibits the
function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, murine double minute-2
protein (MDM2), which stabilizes the protein and fosters its
binding to and degradation of p53 in del(5q) MDS (13). Because
EpoR turnover is regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation, we evaluated the effects of lenalidomide on the E3

Ineffective erythropoiesis manifested as refractory anemia
remains the principal management challenge for patients with
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; refs. 1, 2). Bone marrow
progenitors from patients with MDS display diminished
STAT5 activation and transcriptional response to erythropoietin
(Epo) stimulation, despite appropriate Epo receptor (EpoR)
membrane display (3, 4). The precise mechanisms underlying
the impairment in cytokine signaling remain unclear.

ubiquitin ligase, Really Interesting New Gene (RING) ﬁnger
protein 41 [RNF41, also known as neuroregulin receptor degradation protein-1 (Nrdp1)]. RNF41 regulates steady-state or
ligand-independent, JAK2-associated type I receptor surface
expression, signaling, and intracellular sorting by controlling
ubiquitin-speciﬁc peptidase (USP)-8 and the endosomal sorting
complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-0 stability (14, 15). We
hypothesized that lenalidomide modulates JAK2/EpoR stability
through inhibition of RNF41 to enhance JAK2 competent receptor
signaling.

HEK293T cells acquired from ATCC were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell lines were authenticated
by DSMZ and ATCC using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis
proﬁling and passaged for fewer than 6 months after receipt.
Normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) were
purchased from Lonza Walkersville. Lenalidomide was purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc. Ubiquitin, IL3-Ra, c-Kit, IFNAR,
EpoR (sc-697), and CD71 antibodies were purchased from

mg/mL leupeptin, 0.2 mg/mL pepstatin A, and 500 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF). For detection of USP8,
cells were lysed in 2 SDS gel loading buffer (62.5 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromophenol blue sodium salt sonicated),
then sonicated using the Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode). Proteins
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked in
5% dry milk PBST solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and
incubated with the indicated antibody. Membranes were
washed and developed using ECL or ECLþ according to manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Quantitative PCR

(Qiagen). cDNA was generated using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit per protocol (Life Technology, Applied
Biosystems). ActB, 18S, and GAPDH RNA were used as endogenous controls. EpoR and cereblon mRNA were detected using
TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Life Technology, Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out on
an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System with triplicate
samples using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix with 2-minute
incubation at 50 C, followed by activation of AmpliTaq Gold for
10 minutes at 95 C, then 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 C and 1

Immunoprecipitation
Two hundred micrograms of protein from total cell lysates was
incubated with 2 mg of indicated antibody for 2 hours on ice. Fifty
microliters of Protein G Agarose beads (EMD Millipore) was
added and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4 C. Bead lysate
slurries were washed three times in lysis buffer. Sample buffer was
then added, and beads were dissociated at 95 C for 5 minutes.
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with
the indicated antibodies.
Immunoﬂuorescence
MNCs were isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque Plus gradient centrifugation and were treated with 1 mmol/L lenalidomide for 1
hour (GE Healthcare). The cells were cytospun for 5 minutes at
450 rpm. Slides were ﬁxed in BD cytoﬁx for 10 minutes at 37 C,
washed with PBS, then blocked in 2% BSA/PBS for 5 minutes at
room temperature (RT). Cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:50 for EpoR and 1:200 for CD71) for 1 hour at RT,
washed, and incubated in secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 hour
at RT. Cells were washed again, DAPI and coverslip were added.
Micrographs were taken using a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS Laser
Scanning Confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Data were
analyzed on pooled cells using Image Pro Plus version 6.2 (Media
Cybernetics, Inc.).
Transfections
HEK293T cells were transfected with pMET7/EpoR and
pMET7/RNF41 expression vectors kindly provided by Dr. Jan
Tavernier. Brieﬂy, cells were transfected with 2 mg DNA by calcium
phosphate method. Three hours after transfection, medium was
changed. Cells were either harvested for expression detection or
treated after 48 hours. Scrambled and shCRBN-speciﬁc shRNA
(TG305228) constructs were purchased from Origene Technologies, Inc. Six million UT7 cells were suspended in 100 mL of
electroporation solution (Ingenio Solution, Mirus Bio LLC.) and 5
mg of plasmid was added. Cells were electroporated using Amaxa
Nucleofector program T-20 and resuspended in 20 mL of aMEM
with 5 ng/mL GM-CSF. Functional assays were performed 72
hours after transfection.
Luciferase reporter assays
HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 mg of RNF41 construct,
together with a STAT3-dependent pXP2d2-rPAPI luciferase
reporter plasmid (200 ng) and a b-gal reporter construct (200
ng) to correct for transfection efﬁciency. HEK293T cells were
washed 24 hours post-transfection, transferred to a 96-well plate
and left untreated or co-treated for at least 24 hours with human
LIF (10 ng/mL; EMD Millipore) and the indicated amount of
lenalidomide. Luciferase activity from triplicate samples was
measured by chemiluminescence in a TopCount luminometer
(PerkinElmer) and expressed as relative light units normalized for
transfection efﬁciency. All luciferase data shown are based on at
least three independent experiments (n ¼ 3).
Immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded bone marrow trephine biopsies were
deparafﬁnized using EZ Prep Solution (Ventana Medical System, Inc.). Slides were stained sequentially, ﬁrst with prediluted
spectrin (Cell Marque) for 16 minutes followed by secondary

Lenalidomide Stabilizes EpoR via RNF41 Inhibition

3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromagen. Retrieval was done
with cell conditioning 1 (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.). Slides
were dehydrated and cover-slipped for analysis. Slides were
scanned using Aperio ScanScope XT with a 200/0.8NA objective lens via tri-liner array. Three regions from each slide were
manually selected by the study pathologist and extracted without compression into Deﬁniens Tissue Studio v3.0 software
suite for quantitative analysis. These regional images were
segmented using Tissue Composer to classify colocalized
regions of interest using the red spectrin staining as the initial
nuclear detection marker. The cells of interest were spectrinpositive erythroid cells, which also displayed RNF41 staining.
Therefore, each nucleus within the regions of interest was
identiﬁed with a hematoxylin threshold of 0.16 and an IHC
threshold of 1. Cytoplasmic border was identiﬁed outside the
nuclear border. The training algorithm was closely monitored
by the study pathologist and applied to all images representative of the patients' slides.

Results
Lenalidomide upregulates EpoR protein expression
To determine the effect of lenalidomide on EpoR expression,
UT7 erythroid progenitor cells were treated with increasing con-

centrations of lenalidomide for 1 hour. We previously reported
that both recombinant erythropoietin stimulation and treatment
with lenalidomide induces lipid raft formation and aggregation in
UT7 and MDS cells, accompanied by recruitment of EpoR, JAK2,
and STAT5 into raft fractions (16, 17). Immunoblot analyses
showed that lenalidomide treatment of UT7 cells increased EpoR
protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner at physiologically relevant concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mmol/L
(Fig. 1A and B). We next treated UT7 cells up to 24 hours and
found that upregulation of EpoR by lenalidomide increased 2fold within 1 hour of treatment and increased thereafter through
8 hours of incubation with no signiﬁcant decay until 24 hours of
drug exposure (Fig. 1C and D). Of note, certain EpoR antibodies
have been reported to detect doublets in UT7 cells, corresponding
to suspected maturation isoforms of the receptor (18). Speciﬁcity
of EpoR antibodies used in these studies was conﬁrmed using
additional EpoR antibodies, including one provided by Amgen.
To determine whether EpoR upregulation was transcriptionally
mediated, EpoR gene expression was assessed by qPCR after
1 mmol/L lenalidomide exposure. There was no change in EpoR
mRNA expression after drug treatment, indicating that receptor
protein upregulation is mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism (Fig. 1E). To investigate whether lenalidomide had similar

receptor modulating effects in primary erythroid progenitors, BMMNCs were isolated from three normal donors, and changes in
EpoR expression were assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy in
erythroid precursors identiﬁed by CD71 expression (Fig. 2A).
Lenalidomide induced a signiﬁcant increase in EpoR expression
in normal, primary erythroid progenitors after 1 hour of drug
exposure (Fig. 2B). Mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) of pooled
untreated erythroid progenitors was 1,043.5  32.5 (SE) compared with 1,216.6  51.7 following 1 mmol/L lenalidomide 1hour exposure (P ¼ 0.003).
Lenalidomide increases EpoR stability and type I cytokine
receptor expression
The ﬁndings that lenalidomide yielded a sustained increase in
cellular EpoR expression suggested that lenalidomide may inﬂuence receptor turnover. To determine whether lenalidomide
increased the stability of EpoR protein, we ﬁrst treated cells with
cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis. UT7 cells were
treated with 1 mmol/L cycloheximide for 24 hours either with or

without lenalidomide (co-treated after 24 hours cycloheximide
pretreatment), and lysates were collected at the indicated time
points over a 24-hour period. Western blotting was performed
to assess levels of EpoR at each time point. Addition of lenalidomide markedly extended the half-life of EpoR to beyond
24 hours (Fig. 3A and B). These data demonstrate that lenalidomide stabilizes the EpoR protein, which increases cellular density
of signaling competent receptors. Furthermore, to determine
whether the effects of lenalidomide on receptor turnover involve
only type I or both type I and II cytokine receptors, we examined
the effects of lenalidomide on cellular expression of IL3 receptor
(IL3-Ra; Type I) and c-Kit (Type II). Lenalidomide upregulated
IL3-Ra expression in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas c-Kit expression was unchanged, conﬁrming type I receptor
speciﬁcity (Fig. 3C and D).
Lenalidomide inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF41
Recent investigations have shown that steady-state turnover
of type I receptors, such as EpoR, is regulated by the E3

ubiquitin ligase, RNF41 (14, 19). RNF41 increases the ligandindependent polyubiquitination of both Epo- and IL3 receptors and controls the intracellular sorting and processing of
several type I cytokine receptors by ubiquitination and suppression of cellular USP8 expression (14, 15) We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that RNF41 bound to EpoR/JAK2 complexes after
lenalidomide treatment by RNF41 immunoprecipitation (IP)
followed by EpoR and JAK2 immunoblot (IB). EpoR:RNF41
binding increased in a concentration-dependent fashion following lenalidomide exposure (Fig. 4A). In addition, IP of
EpoR followed by RNF41 IB showed similar results (data not
shown). To investigate the effects of lenalidomide on the E3
ubiquitin ligase function of RNF41, we assessed ubiquitination of several RNF41 substrates after proteasomal inhibition
with bortezomib or MG132, followed by lenalidomide treatment. RNF41 IP followed by ubiquitin IB showed that lenalidomide treatment resulted in concentration-dependent stabilization and cellular accumulation of RNF41 (Fig. 4B) due to
inhibition of RNF41 auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 4C). Drug inhibition of RNF41 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was accompanied
by increase in cellular USP8 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4D) and
increased RNF41 association with EpoR and JAK2 in UT7 cells
(Fig. 4A). Moreover, IP of EpoR followed by ubiquitin IB after
lenalidomide treatment showed decreased ubiquitination of
the receptor (Fig. 4E). Similarly, IP of IL3-Ra, whose receptor
expression is also modulated by RNF41, and ubiquitin IB
following lenalidomide treatment demonstrated a similar
concentration-dependent decrease in ubiquitination of the
receptor (Fig. 4F). Given that bortezomib promotes internalization and the lysosomal degradation of c-Kit, the effects of

www.aacrjournals.org

lenalidomide on type II receptor ubiquitination were assessed
on an alternative receptor, that is, IFN-a/b receptor (IFNAR;
ref. 20). Ubiquitination of IFNAR was unchanged following
treatment with lenalidomide, conﬁrming type I cytokine receptor speciﬁcity (Fig. 4G). These ﬁndings suggest that the E3
ubiquitin ligase inhibitory effects of lenalidomide extend to
RNF41.
RNF41 overexpression abrogates lenalidomide-induced EpoR
upregulation and leukemia inhibitor factor receptor signaling
To conﬁrm that RNF41 is the principal target of lenalidomide responsible for EpoR stabilization, we transfected
HEK293T cells with EpoR and/or RNF41 expression vectors
using the calcium phosphate method. Steady-state EpoR
expression was lower in EpoR/RNF41 cells than in cells transfected with EpoR alone (Fig. 5A and B). Moreover, EpoR
upregulation by lenalidomide was abrogated in EpoR/RNF41
cells, indicating that RNF41 is a critical determinant of EpoR
upregulation by lenalidomide. Parallel to enhanced EpoR
signaling (17), lenalidomide treatment increased the STAT3
reporter activity of HEK293T cells stimulated with leukemia
inhibitory factor (LIF; Fig. 5C). Similar to lenalidomideinduced EpoR upregulation, this effect is lost upon ectopic
RNF41 overexpression.
EpoR upregulation by lenalidomide is independent of cereblon
As binding of lenalidomide to the CUL4–RBX1–DDB1–
CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is implicated in many
of its biologic effects in multiple myeloma and MDS with
deletion of chromosome 5q [del(5q)] (21, 22), we investigated

CRBN (Fig. 6A–C), and EpoR modulation was assessed following treatment with 1 mmol/L lenalidomide for 1 hour. Upregulation of EpoR by lenalidomide was preserved after CRBN
knockdown (Fig. 6D and E), indicating that lenalidomideinduced receptor modulation is independent of cereblon. Interestingly, lenalidomide treatment modestly increased CRBN
protein expression (Fig. 6B and C), consistent with recent
reports that lenalidomide stabilizes CRBN (23).

that approached signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.058), whereas non-responders showed no discernible change (Fig. 7B). These results suggest
that erythroid RNF41 expression is modulated by lenalidomide in
patients, and the ability of lenalidomide to reduce expression in
responding patients may be an important biologic marker of
therapeutic efﬁcacy.

Discussion
Ebert and colleagues reported that bone marrow progenitors
from lenalidomide-responsive patients with MDS display lower
levels of expression of erythroid-speciﬁc genes that is restored
by lenalidomide treatment. Although these ﬁndings have not
been validated in a larger cohort, the data suggest that lenalidomide positively modiﬁes EpoR signaling. Indeed, both lenalidomide and pomalidomide promote the expansion of primitive erythroid precursors in response to Epo stimulation (6).
Moreover, we recently reported that lenalidomide treatment of

www.aacrjournals.org

UT7 and primary MDS erythroid progenitors enhances phosphorylation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-2 and STAT5 in response
to Epo stimulation (17). Ubiquitination and endocytosis of the
EpoR governs the amplitude and duration of cytokine signaling
by controlling both membrane residence of signal competent
receptors and the rapidity of receptor degradation. Our investigations show that lenalidomide stabilizes and upregulates
expression of signaling competent JAK2-associated EpoR complexes in a concentration-dependent fashion. This is mediated
by posttranscriptional inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity of RNF41, which regulates steady-state type I cytokine
receptor membrane turnover. In addition to diminishing
RNF41 auto-ubiquitination, which results in increased RNF41
expression, lenalidomide treatment increased USP8 expression
and basal expression and signaling of EpoR and IL3 receptors,
without altering expression of type II receptors such as c-Kit and
IFNAR. Furthermore, forced expression of RNF41 in HEK293T
cells completely abrogated the capacity of lenalidomide to

EpoR upregulation by lenalidomide is independent of cereblon. A, relative expression of UT7 CRBN mRNA detected by qPCR following transfection with

independent experiments.

upregulate EpoR and LIF receptor expression, conﬁrming that
RNF41 is a key determinant of receptor modulation by lenalidomide. Importantly, we demonstrate that drug-induced
EpoR upregulation occurs independent of cereblon. Furthermore, IHC analysis of cellular RNF41 expression in bone
marrow erythroid precursors of responding patients demonstrated marked reductions in RNF41 expression following
treatment, suggesting that RNF41 expression may be a useful
biomarker predictive for response to lenalidomide that merits
further investigation in a larger patient cohort.
RNF41 serves as a scaffold protein coordinating ubiquitin
transfer from a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) recruited
by its N-terminal RING domain to substrates that interact with
its C-terminal substrate–binding domain. Of particular interest, RNF41 was recently found to control Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-mediated responses through ubiquitination of the central adaptor MyD88 and the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1;
ref. 24). Increasing evidence implicates activation of innate
immune signaling in the pathobiology of MDS (25–27). These
ﬁndings suggest that lenalidomide, through inhibition of
RNF41, may stabilize TLR signal intermediates to augment

TLR-induced myeloid proliferation while enhancing erythroid
receptor signaling (28). This notion supports our previous
ﬁndings that lenalidomide treatment promotes proliferation
of immature myeloid precursors at the expense of terminal
differentiation, thereby contributing to the myelosuppressive
effects of lenalidomide while promoting effective erythropoiesis (29).
Our data support the recent ﬁndings that lenalidomide
inhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, including cereblon
and MDM2 (9, 10, 12, 13). Collectively, these data suggest
that lenalidomide may act as a much broader RING ﬁnger E3
ubiquitin ligase inhibitor than originally appreciated. For
instance, Rac GTPases, responsible for actin cytoskeletal reorganization and plasma membrane compartmentalization, are
activated by IMiDs by an unknown mechanism. Perhaps
inhibition of speciﬁc ligases that ubiquitinate these GTPases
underlies the drug activating effects. Furthermore, E3 ligases
are important for cellular transport, and inhibition by lenalidomide may have a profound effect on the spatial organization
of cellular machinery (30). In addition, as E3 ubiquitin ligases
are important for chromatin remodeling, lenalidomide

Lenalidomide Stabilizes EpoR via RNF41 Inhibition

Figure 7.
RNF41 expression decreases in primary lenalidomide responders. A, representative IHC micrograph of MDS bone marrow biopsies depicting RNF41 (brown)
and spectrin (red) staining, and the corresponding mean RNF41 intensity in the erythroid population. B, quantitation of the mean RNF41 intensity in the
spectrin-positive cells. Lenalidomide responders (n ¼ 10) demonstrate a reduction in cellular RNF41 expression (P ¼ 0.058), whereas no signiﬁcant reduction
is observed in non-responders (n ¼ 16).

inhibition of these proteins may have signiﬁcant effects on
gene expression (31). Recently, the E3 ubiquitin ligase
SMURF2 (Smad ubiquitin regulating factor 2) was shown to
regulate histone 2B (H2B) ubiquitination, and consequently
methylation, through inhibition of the RING ﬁnger ligase,
RNF20 (31).
Notably, lenalidomide-induced degradation of casein kinase
1A1 (CK1a) and the lymphoid transcription factors Ikaros and
Aiolos has been shown to occur through modulation of the
CUL4–RBX1–DDB1–CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, contributing to the therapeutic efﬁcacy of this agent in both MDS
with deletion of chromosome 5q [del(5q)] and myeloma,
respectively (21, 22). In these contexts, lenalidomide binds
CRBN to induce activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, it
is likely that the effects of lenalidomide are mediated by
alteration of multiple cellular regulatory networks via inhibition or enhanced activation of varied ubiquitin ligases, resulting in biologic consequences that are largely context-dependent. Further investigations of ubiquitin ligases are warranted
and will provide additional insight into the molecular actions
of this immunomodulatory agent.
