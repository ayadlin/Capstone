Abstract
Curcumin, a plant polyphenol, is a widely studied chemopreventive agent with demonstrated antitumor
activities in preclinical studies and low toxicity profiles in multiple clinical trials against human malignancies.
We previously showed that curcumin radiosensitizes cervical tumor cells without increasing the cytotoxic
effects of radiation on normal human fibroblasts. Here we report that an inhibitory activity of curcumin on
the antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin reductase-1 (TxnRd1) is required for curcumin-mediated radiosensitization of squamous carcinoma cells. Stable knockdown of TxnRd1 in both HeLa and FaDu cells nearly abolished
curcumin-mediated radiosensitization. TxnRd1 knockdown cells showed decreased radiation-induced reactive
oxygen species and sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation, which we previously showed
was required for curcumin-mediated radiosensitization. Conversely, overexpressing catalytically active TxnRd1
in HEK293 cells, with low basal levels of TxnRd1, increased their sensitivity to curcumin alone and to the
combination of curcumin and ionizing radiation. These results show the critical role of TxnRd1 in curcuminmediated radiosensitization and suggest that TxnRd1 levels in tumors could have clinical value as a predictor of
response to curcumin and radiotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1941–50. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The success of radiotherapy depends on the ability to target malignant cells with radiation while simultaneously protecting surrounding normal tissues from its cytotoxic effects.
One pharmacologic approach for increasing the clinical response to radiotherapy is the use of radiation response modifiers that either preferentially sensitize tumor cells or protect
normal tissues from radiation-induced damage. Curcumin, a
naturally occurring plant polyphenol, has an extensive history of use in diet and traditional medicine. Several preclinical studies carried out over the last 20 years have shown
direct antitumorigenic activity in mouse tumor models (1).
Curcumin's antitumor properties occur through pleiotropic
mechanisms, including inhibition of proliferation, induction
of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, immune modulation,
and suppression of inflammation (reviewed in ref. 2). Curcumin has a low toxicity profile and has been well tolerated in

multiple phase I and II clinical trials for malignant and nonmalignant diseases (2).
Several groups, including our own, have shown that curcumin selectively radiosensitizes tumor cells (3–5) without enhancing the effects of radiation on nontransformed cells or
normal tissue (6, 7). We previously showed that curcumin
sensitized cervical tumor cells, but not normal fibroblasts
to ionizing radiation (IR). Mechanistically, we found that pretreatment of tumor cells with curcumin and IR resulted in
elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to
sustained activation extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and that
both were required for curcumin-mediated radiosensitization
(3). However, the molecular mechanism accounting for the
differential effects of curcumin in fully transformed and normal cells remained unclear.
Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TxnRd1) is one of several identified molecular targets of curcumin (8). TxnRds are essential
mammalian selenocysteine containing flavoenzymes that act
in homodimeric form to catalyze NADPH-dependent reduction of thioredoxin and small molecular weight oxidants including ROS (9, 10). TxnRd1 and TxnRd2 (the cytosolic/
nuclear and mitochondrial form, respectively) are two ubiquitously expressed isoforms of this enzyme family. They play
a key role in maintaining redox-regulated cellular functions,
including transcription, DNA damage recognition and repair,
proliferation, and apoptosis (9). In response to oxidative
stress, TxnRds sustain signaling pathways that regulate transcription of genes to protect the cell from oxidative damage
(11–13). Cytosolic TxnRd1 expression is often upregulated in
human cancers, wherein it is associated with aggressive tumor

growth and poor prognosis (14). TxnRd1 has been shown to
confer protection against the lethal effects of IR in tumor cells
(11). Moreover, agents that selectively target TxnRd1 have
shown promising results as anticancer drugs in preclinical
and clinical studies (15, 16) when used alone or when combined with IR (11). Fang and colleagues recently (8) showed
that curcumin covalently binds to the selenocysteine residue
of TxnRd1, thereby inhibiting its catalytic activity.
Based on these findings and our previous studies (3), we hypothesized that curcumin-mediated inhibition of TxnRd1 activity could enhance radiation sensitivity by decreasing the
capacity of TxnRd1 to scavenge IR-induced ROS and/or decrease the activity of prosurvival signaling cascades activated
by IR. We report that knockdown of TxnRd1 in squamous carcinoma cell lines significantly decreases curcumin-mediated
radiosensitization. Conversely, overexpression in cells with
low basal levels of TxnRd1 increased their sensitivity to curcumin alone and to the combination of curcumin and IR. These
results show that TxnRd1 is required for curcumin-mediated
radiosensitization.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HeLa, SiHa, FaDu (American Type Culture
Collection), SCC-1 (a gift from Dr. Bert O'Malley, Jr., University of Pennsylvania), HEK293-pIRES, and HEK293-TxnRd1 (a
gift from Dr. Giannis Spyrou, Academy of Athens, Greece) cell
lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. MSK-Leuk1 (a gift from
Dr. Peter Sacks and Memorial Sloane Kettering Hospital) and
keratinocytes (Invitrogen) were maintained in defined keratinocyte serum-free media with growth factor supplements.
Reagents. All chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin were dissolved in DMSO (10 mmol/L stock solution). Puromycin
and G418 were dissolved in water (1 and 200 mg/mL stock
solutions, respectively). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate
(DCF-DA) was dissolved in DMSO (20 mmol/L stock solution).
Generation of stable TxnRd1 knockdown cells. A set of
nontargeting shRNA (shNT) and four shRNA plasmids targeting different coding regions of the TxnRd1 gene (shTR1) were
purchased (SA Biosciences, KH02104P). HeLa and FaDu cells
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). At 48 h posttransfection, equal numbers of cells were
plated from mock and plasmid-transfected plates. At 24 h postplating, cells were treated with 2 μg/mL puromycin for 48 h,
and clones were allowed to grow. Selected clones were maintained in 0.5 μg/mL puromycin.
Clonogenic survival assays (low density). HeLa cells were
plated in 60-mm dishes at low densities and allowed to attach
overnight. Cells were irradiated in the presence of curcumin or
DMSO, using a 137Cs source (dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min). Colony
formation, fixation, and counting were performed as described (3). Survival curves were fitted using a second-order
polynomial function. The average normalized surviving fraction from three independent experiments was reported
(±SE). Dose enhancement ratio (DER) values were calculated
at 0.37 survival fraction.

Clonogenic survival assays (high density). FaDu cells were
plated in 60-mm dishes at high densities and allowed to attach
overnight. Cells were pretreated for 8 h with curcumin and then
irradiated using a 137Cs source (dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min). At 1 h after irradiation, cells were trypsinized and subcultured at low densities. Colony formation, fixation, and counting were performed
as described (3). Survival curves were fitted using a second-order
polynomial function. The average normalized surviving fraction from three independent experiments is reported (±SE).
DER values were calculated at 0.37 survival fraction.
Cell growth assay (MTT assay). MTT assays were performed using the cell proliferation kit (Roche Applied Sciences).
Cells were plated in 24-well plates and treated with different
curcumin doses for 8 h. Cell viability was assessed according
to the manufacturer's protocol when the untreated controls
reached confluence. Aliquots (200 μL) from each well were
transferred into a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured
at 570 nm with an automated plate reader (Thermo Scientific).
Analysis of ROS levels. HeLa clones (shNT and shTR1)
were treated with DMSO or 10 μmol/L curcumin for 8 h.
Cells were incubated with 20 μmol/L DCF-DA for 30 min
at 37°C. The probe was washed off with PBS, and the cells
were either mock irradiated or exposed to a 4-Gy dose of
IR. At 30 min later, the cells were trypsinized, resuspended
in PBS, and analyzed for DCF fluorescence by flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, CellQuest Pro; BD Biosciences).
Immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysates were obtained as described previously (17). For detection of TxnRd1, TxnRd2,
pERK1/2, ERK1/2, and β-actin, 20 to 50 μg of total protein
was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked for 30 min in TBSTween solution containing 5% milk, and incubated for 1 to
2 h with the following antibodies in TBS-Tween solution containing 1% milk: anti-TxnRd1 antibody (Abcam), anti-TxnRd2
antibody (Abcam), anti–β-actin (Sigma), anti-pERK1/2, and
anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling). All membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antimouse or antirabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL Plus
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).
Real-time reverse transcription–PCR. RNA was isolated
from cells following TRI reagent protocol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). Real-time PCR was done on Applied
Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System using Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix. The primer sequences for detecting
human TxnRd1 cDNA were ccactggtgaaagaccacgtt (forward)
and aggagaaaagatcatcactgctgat (reverse). Primer sequences
for 18S rRNA were aaacggctaccacatccaag (forward) and caattacagggcctcgaaag (reverse).
TxnRd activity assay. Cells were plated to 90% confluence,
allowed to attach overnight, and treated with 10 μmol/L curcumin or tetrahydrocurcumin for 8 h. Following treatment,
media were aspirated and replaced with 0.5 mL of media with
Na-R-Lipoate (Na-RALA, GeroNova Research, Inc.) at a final
concentration of 1 mmol/L. After a 2-h incubation, an aliquout
was removed from the media overlying the cell monolayer and
spun at 1,000 × g for 5 min to get rid of cellular debris. Fifty

microliters of cleared media were then added to 100 μL of 5,5′dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution in triplicate wells of a
96-well plate. The plates were incubated for 10 min in the dark.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader
(Thermo Scientific). TxnRd activity was defined by the concentration of sodium-lipoate (disulfide) reduced to dehydrolipoate (dithiol) per milligram protein.
Statistical analysis. For all the clonogenic survival assays,
mean and SEM of survival fraction from three independent
experiments at 4 and 6 Gy for each treatment group were
calculated. ANOVA was used to determine whether there
were significant differences among three or more independent experimental conditions; specific pairwise comparisons
were evaluated by planned contrasts. Student's t test was
used to test for differences between two independent experimental conditions. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. All
tests were two-sided. Statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS Version 17 software (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
Tumor cells express higher levels of TxnRd1 compared
with normal or minimally transformed cells. TxnRd1 ex-

pression is shown to be elevated in several primary human
malignancies and in a number of human cancer cell lines
(14, 18). A subset of aggressive head and neck cancers also
exhibit elevated expression of TxnRd1 mRNA and protein
when compared with normal mucosa (14). We analyzed the
expression of TxnRd1 protein levels and activity in various
squamous carcinoma cell lines (FaDu, SCC-1, and HeLa)
and compared it with that in primary keratinocytes and in
MSK-Leuk1, a premalignant cell line derived from a human
oral leukoplakia. Based on immunoblot analysis, TxnRd1 expression was elevated by >50-fold in FaDu and HeLa cells and
by >20-fold in SCC-1 compared with either MSK-Leuk1 or
keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). Total TxnRd activity was determined
using an assay based on work by Arner and colleagues (19)
and Biaglow and colleagues (20). These investigators showed
that mammalian TxnRds reduce lipoate to dehydrolipoate
more efficiently than lipoate dehydrogenase (19) and that
the reduction of lipoate in intact tumor cells was largely dependent on TxnRd activity (20). As shown in Fig. 1B, basal
TxnRd activity correlated with levels of TxnRd1 protein;
TxnRd activity was ∼20-fold higher in FaDu and HeLa cells
and ∼7-fold higher in SCC-1 compared with that in keratinocytes or MSK-Leuk1 cells.

keratinocytes, and three squamous carcinoma cell lines [HeLa (cervical), FaDu, and SCC-1 (head and neck)] were analyzed for TxnRd1 protein levels
by immunoblot analysis. β-Actin was used as a loading control. B, basal levels of whole-cell TxnRd activity. Activity was measured as nanomoles

8 h and assayed for TxnRd activity. Activity was measured as nanomoles dihydrolipoate formed per milligram protein and normalized to own cells untreated
control. D, keratinocytes, MSK-Leuk1, FaDu, and HeLa cells were treated with DMSO at 10, 20, or 50 μmol/L curcumin for 8 h. Whole-cell lysates
were analyzed for curcumin-induced apoptosis by immunoblot assay using antibodies against cleaved PARP and β-actin.

cells by expressing a nontargeting shRNA (shNT) or an shRNA targeting human TxnRd1 (shTR1). A, untransfected cells, shNT, and shTR1 clones were
analyzed for TxnRd1 mRNA levels by real-time reverse transcription–PCR analysis. TxnRd1 mRNA levels were normalized to 18s rRNA control and
normalized to mRNA levels in untransfected HeLa or FaDu cells. PCR reactions were done in triplicate (±SEM); *, P < 0.05. B, TxnRd1 protein levels assayed

Curcumin inhibits TxnRd activity and enhances apoptosis
in a manner-dependent on transformation status. We subsequently examined the ability of curcumin to inhibit TxnRd
activity in HeLa and FaDu cells. Curcumin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in TxnRd activity with
an IC50 of ∼10 μmol/L in both cell lines (Fig. 1C). These results are in agreement with those of Fang and colleagues,
wherein TxnRd1 activity was measured by assaying the reduction of insulin in curumin-treated and untreated HeLa
cell lysates (8). In that study, the Michael acceptor function
of curcumin was proposed to mediate the inhibition of
TxnRd activity. To test this possibility more stringently, we
used tetrahydrocurcumin, a curcumin metabolite lacking
the α,β-unsaturated carbon double bond that is presumably
required for curcumin to covalently inhibit TxnRd1. As predicted, tetrahydrocurcumin had no significant effect on
TxnRd activity at doses of up to 50 μmol/L (Fig. 1C).

Curcumin has been shown to selectively induce apoptosis
in transformed cells (21). Therefore, we determined the effects of curcumin on levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a marker of apoptosis, in keratinocytes
(normal untransformed cells), MSK-Leuk1 (minimally transformed), FaDu, and HeLa cells (fully transformed) at 24 hours
after curcumin treatment. Levels of cleaved PARP did not appreciably increase in keratinocytes or MSK-Leuk1 cells treated
with curcumin doses of up to 20 μmol/L. However, there was a
modest increase in cleaved PARP observed with 50 μmol/L
curcumin. In contrast, curcumin induced a robust increase
in cleaved PARP in both FaDu and HeLa cells. This increase
exhibited a dose dependence, which was evident at doses as
low as 10 μmol/L in FaDu (Fig. 1D). In accordance with reports
that tetrahydrocurcumin retains the antioxidant effects, but
not the proapoptotic activity, of the parental drug (22), we
did not observe an increase in cleaved PARP in any of the cells

lines treated with tetrahydrocurcumin doses up to 50 μmol/L
(data not shown). These results show that curcumin enhances
apoptosis preferentially in fully transformed squamous carcinoma cells and that this activity parallels its inhibitory activity
on TxnRd1.
Efficient knockdown of TxnRd1 in squamous carcinoma
cell lines. To test whether TxnRd1 is required for curcuminmediated radiosensitization, we generated stable clones from
both the HeLa and FaDu cell lines expressing an shRNA targeting a unique sequence in TxnRd1 gene (shTR1) or a nontargeting shRNA (shNT). For HeLa cells, two stable clones
(shTR1-3.2 and shTR1-3.3) were selected using shRNA-3,
whereas another two stable clones (shTR1-1.2 and shTR11.5) were selected using shRNA-1. For FaDu cells, one stable
clone (shTR1-1.1) was selected using shRNA-1 and one stable
clone using (shTR1-2.1) was selected using shRNA-2. All six
knockdown clones exhibited >70% reduction in TxnRd1
mRNA levels compared with corresponding shNT clones
transfected with the shNT plasmid (Fig. 2A). Consistent with
mRNA levels, the HeLa-shTR1 clones showed over a 90% decrease (Fig. 2B, left) and FaDu-shTR1 clones showed an 80%
decrease (Fig. 2B, right) in TxnRd1 protein levels as determined by immunoblot analysis. Moreover, there was a 50%
reduction of TxnRd activity observed in HeLa-shTR1 clones
(Fig. 2C, left) and 40% reduction in FaDu-shTR1 clones

(Fig. 2C, right) compared with the respective shNT clones.
The residual activity most likely reflects activity due to the
mitochondrial TxnRd2 isoform, whose levels are not substantially affected by these shRNA sequences (Fig. 2B).
Stable TxnRd1 knockdown in squamous carcinoma
cells inhibits curcumin-mediated radiosensitization. To
determine whether TxnRd1 is involved in the enhancement
of the cytotoxic response of curcumin in combination with
IR, we performed clonogenic survival assays on shNT and
shTR1 clones from HeLa, SiHa (another cervical squamous
carcinoma cell line), and FaDu cells. As predicted from our
previous report (3), HeLa, SiHa, and FaDu cells stably expressing control shRNA (shNT clones) were significantly
sensitized to IR by pretreatment with curcumin. The DERs
at a surviving fraction of 0.37 ranged from 1.32 to 1.92
(Fig. 3A–D; Table 1). Knocking down TxnRd1 in HeLa
and FaDu cells resulted in enhanced sensitivity to IR, in
agreement with previous reports (ref. 12; Fig. 3A–D). Notably, curcumin failed to increase the radiosensitivity in the
HeLa and FaDu shTR1 clones (Fig. 3A–D). Interestingly, in
one of the HeLa clones (shTR1-3.2), curcumin induced a
statistically significant radioprotective effect (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results indicate that TxnRd1 is required
for curcumin-mediated radiosensitization of squamous carcinoma cell lines.

TxnRd1 knockdown leads to reduced ROS generation
and ERK1/2 activation following curcumin and IR treatments. In our previous study (3), we showed that pretreatment of tumor cells with curcumin led to enhanced
production of IR-induced ROS resulting in sustained ERK1/
2-MAPK activation. To test the effect of TxnRd1 knockdown
on ROS generation following combined treatment with curcumin and IR, we used DCF-DA, a probe whose fluorescence
is directly proportional to intracellular ROS levels (23). Treatment of HeLa shNT (control) and shTR1-3.2 (TxnRd1 knockdown) clones with curcumin did not significantly increase
ROS levels (Fig. 4A). A single dose of 4 Gy induced an increase in ROS levels that was significantly higher in the
shTR1 clones, which is consistent with the role of TxnRd1
as a ROS scavenger. Combined curcumin and IR treatment
caused a substantial increase in ROS in the shNT clone,
but not in the shTR1-3.2 clone. Quantitation of three independent experiments showed a similar trend (Fig. 4B). Similar results in terms of curcumin-mediated ROS changes were
observed in a second HeLa clone, shTR1-1.2 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Interestingly, clone shTR1-3.2, which exhibited a
larger increase in ROS induction upon IR treatment compared with shTR1-1.2, also showed a larger effect in terms
of radiosensitization upon knockdown of TxnRd1. These results indicate that higher levels of TxnRd1 result in increased
levels of ROS in response to the combined treatment of curcumin and IR.
Our previous study (3) indicated that increased ROS production following treatment with curcumin and IR led to sus-

tained ERK1/2 activation. To determine the effects of
TxnRd1 knockdown on ERK1/2 activation, we performed immunoblot analysis on irradiated HeLa-shNT and HeLa-shTR1
cells that were pretreated with either curcumin or DMSO. As
shown in Fig. 4C, irradiated cells showed a transient increase
in phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels that decreased to baseline
within an hour after irradiation. Pretreatment with curcumin
prolonged IR-induced ERK1/2 activation in the HeLa-shNT
cells for up to 6 hours after IR. This sustained ERK1/2 activation was not observed in the HeLa-shTR1 cells after curcumin treatment. These results show that the increased
production of ROS and the sustained ERK1/2 activation
(which we have previously shown is required for curcumininduced radiosensitization) are dependent on the levels of
TxnRd1 protein.
Overexpression of TxnRd1 increases radiosensitivity to
curcumin. To determine if overexpression of TxnRd1 is sufficient to cause curcumin-mediated radiosensitization, we attempted to overexpress TxnRd1 in keratinocytes and the
minimally transformed MSK-Leuk1 cells. However, the intricate mammalian selenoprotein synthesis machinery imposes
a major obstacle in constructing stable selenoprotein-expressing mammalian cell lines. Specifically, previous studies
showed that TxnRd1 expression is tightly regulated by multiple AU-rich sequences in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR;
refs. 24, 25). Indeed, our attempts to overexpress TxnRd1 in
either keratinocytes or MSK-Leuk1 cells were unsuccessful.
To overcome this problem, we searched for cell lines with
low basal TxnRd1 levels, which could allow for TxnRd1 overexpression. One such line reported in the literature is the
HEK293 cell line (24). We obtained the HEK293 cells stably
expressing the full-length TxnRd1 gene (HEK293-TxnRd1)
and also HEK293 cells expressing the empty pIRES vector
(HEK293-pIRES). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the overexpression of TxnRd1 protein in HEK293-TxnRd1 cells (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, TxnRd1 activity was 6-fold higher in HEK293TxnRd1 cells compared with HEK293-pIRES cells, indicating
that the expressed protein was enzymatically active (Fig. 5B).
Also as shown in Fig. 5C, HEK293-TxnRd1 cells exhibited significantly reduced survival in response to curcumin compared
with the HEK293-pIRES cells, whereas tetrahydrocurcumin did
not result in significant cytotoxicity in either of the HEK293
cell lines, confirming the role of TxnRd1 in determining curcumin mediated cytotoxicity.
Using a dose of 10 μmol/L curcumin, we performed clonogenic
survival assays on irradiated HEK293-pIRES and HEK293TxnRd1 cells. As predicted from the work of Smart and colleagues (12), HEK293-TxnRd1 cells were more radioresistant
than HEK 293-pIRES cells. Pretreating HEK293-pIRES cells
with curcumin did not induce significant radiosensitization.
In contrast, the HEK293-TxnRd1 cells were significantly radiosensitized by 10 μmol/L curcumin, with a DER of 1.52 at 0.37
survival fraction (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results indicate that TxnRd1 confers increased radioresistance and that
TxnRd1-overexpressing cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to

Mechanism of Radiosensitization by Curcumin

Discussion
Several reports have identified curcumin as a potent protector of normal tissue against radiation-induced damage.
Administration of curcumin significantly reduced various
normal tissue toxicities in rodent models treated with
whole-body radiation (6, 26, 27). Intriguingly, curcumin has
also been shown to radiosensitize various tumor cell lines
in vitro (3–5) and induce a pronounced tumor growth delay
following irradiation in mouse tumor models (28, 29). These
findings indicate that curcumin has the ability to preferentially radiosensitize tumor, but not normal tissue, a remarkable property for a radiation response modifier that could
translate into substantial clinical benefit. However, the mechanism behind this selective property of curcumin has remained elusive, and potential targets, including NF-κB, Akt,
etc. (4, 30, 31), have not been rigorously tested as causative
factors in this effect.
Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells produce higher basal levels of ROS (32) than normal cells. Under this persistent intrinsic oxidative stress, cancer cells develop an
enhanced endogenous antioxidant capacity, which makes

them more resistant to exogenous oxidants (33, 34). The upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme TxnRd1 is observed in
multiple primary human malignancies, and its loss has been
associated with a reversal of tumor phenotype and a decrease in tumorigenicity (35). These observations support
the speculation that malignant cells could be sensitized to
oxidants, including IR, by inhibition of this key antioxidant
protein (12, 36).
It has been hypothesized that TxnRd1 may be necessary to
counteract IR-induced changes in intracellular protein thiol
oxidation/reduction status and to directly scavenge cytotoxic free radicals formed during exposure to IR. This hypothesis was tested by Smart and colleagues (12) using cell
lines overexpressing wild-type or dominant-negative form of
TxnRd1 (cysteine mutant). This study showed that HeLa cells
overexpressing the wild-type but not the dominant-negative
form of TxnRd1 were more resistant to the lethal effects of
IR, suggesting that TxnRd1 is a clinically relevant target for
novel radiosensitizing agents. Moreover, in a separate study,
motexafin gadolinium, a potent inhibitor of TxnRd (37), has
been shown to enhance tumor cell response to IR (38) and
currently is in phase I clinical trials for patients with brain

using antibodies against p-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2. The results are representative of three independent experiments.

metastases from lung and breast cancers (15). Our results
showing a significant increase in the radiosensitivity of
HeLa and FaDu cells with knockdown TxnRd1 levels are
in agreement with these data and further support the role
of TxnRd1 as a major determinant of intrinsic tumor cell
radiosensitivity (39).
Our attempts to overexpress TxnRd1 in nontransformed
primary keratinocytes that normally express low levels of
the protein were not successful, even when using a plasmid
that had been used to express TxnRd1 in HEK293 cells (24).
However, this was not unexpected, because previous reports
showed that major obstacles exist to overexpressing TxnRd1
in mammalian cells (24, 25). TxnRd1 expression is regulated
by sequences in the 3′ UTR including AU-rich elements
(ARE) that exert stringent regulatory control over translation
of TxnRd1 mRNA. ARE-binding proteins and microRNAs that

1948

Cancer Res; 70(5) March 1, 2010

selectively recognize AU-rich sequences can affect the stability of TxnRd1 mRNA levels and protein expression (40). One
or more of these factors may contribute to the differential
expression of TxnRd1 in tumor and normal cells. This is an
area of ongoing investigation in our laboratory.
Based on the findings presented here, we propose that the
preferential radiosensitization of tumor cells by curcumin is, in
part, due to the elevated expression of the TxnRd1. The involvement of TxnRd1 in curcumin-mediated radiosensitization
seems to be 2-fold. First, curcumin covalently binds to TxnRd1,
irreversibly inhibiting its ability to reduce thioredoxin, which
in turn is required for many of the pleiotropic antioxidant effects associated with TxnRd1 (9). Second, modification of the
selenocysteine residue of TxnRd1 converts the protein from
essential antioxidant enzyme to a protein with NADPH oxidase activity, thereby elevating oxidative stress. Both effects

Mechanism of Radiosensitization by Curcumin

would enhance the oxidative burden on the cell, leading to
greater clonogenic cell death (a finding supported by our
previous work showing ablation of curcumin-mediated radiosensitization by the antioxidant NAC; ref. 3). Normal cells that
express very low levels of TxnRd1 are not radiosensitized by
curcumin. Whereas this phenomenon could be explained by
low levels of TxnRd1, we have not excluded other possible mechanisms of radioprotection. For example, at least in vivo, it
has been postulated that the radioprotective effects of curcumin could be due to its inhibitory effects on the expression of
inflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines (6).
Our findings further suggest that TxnRd1 may mediate
radiosensitization by additional natural and chemical compounds. Curcumin reacts as a potent Michael acceptor due
to the presence of α,β-unsaturated ketone moieties coupled with
electron withdrawing phenolic hydroxyl groups. Curcumininduced inhibition of TxnRd1 is dependent on the Michael acceptor function by which curcumin binds covalently to the
highly nucleophilic selenocysteine residue in the COOH terminus of TxnRd1 (8, 41). Tetrahydrocurcumin, which lacks the
α,β-unsaturated ketone moieties, does not inhibit TxnRd1
activity and does not radiosensitize tumor cells. These observations suggest that compounds with Michael acceptor functionality could represent a novel family of radiosensitizers that
are selective for transformed cells. Moreover, direct inhibition
of TxnRd1 activity could be a useful means for screening natural and synthetic compounds for Michael acceptor functionality. Notably, caffeic acid phenethyl ester and oleocanthal
acid, two additional natural compounds with Michael accep-

tor functionality, are also inhibitors of TxnRd1 and potent
tumor radiosensitizers.4
In conclusion, our results support a critical role of TxnRd1
in curcumin-mediated radiosensitization. Analysis of TxnRd1
levels in the tumors of patients enrolled in curcumin clinical
trials could provide a valuable tool in identifying patients
who would respond favorably to combined use of curcumin
and radiotherapy.
