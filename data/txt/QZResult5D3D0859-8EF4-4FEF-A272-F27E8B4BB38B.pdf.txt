BACKGROUND: The combination of a platinating agent and etoposide has induced responses in various pediatric tumors. The study estimated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of an oxaliplatin and etoposide regimen
in children with recurrent solid tumors. METHODS: Oxaliplatin was administered on Day 1 and etoposide on
Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day course. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients were enrolled at 3 dose levels: 1) oxaliplatin at
a dose of 130 mg/m2 and etoposide at a dose of 75 mg/m2, 2) oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m2 and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2, and 3) oxaliplatin at a dose of 145 mg/m2 and etoposide at a dose of
100 mg/m2. Calcium and magnesium infusions were used at dose level 3 in an attempt to escalate the oxaliplatin dose past the single-agent MTD. RESULTS: The 16 patients received a total of 63 courses. At dose
level 1, dose-limiting epistaxis, neuropathy, and neutropenia occurred in 1 of 6 patients. No dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) occurred at dose level 2 (n ¼ 6). At dose level 3, 2 of 4 patients experienced dose-limiting
neutropenia; none experienced grade 3 or 4 acute neuropathy. Six patients required prolongation of the
oxaliplatin infusion because of acute sensory neuropathy. Responses were observed in patients with medulloblastoma (1 complete response) and pineoblastoma (1 partial response); 3 others with atypical teratoid
rhabdoid tumor, ependymoma, and soft tissue sarcoma had prolonged disease stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of this regimen was found to be oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m2 given on Day 1 and
etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2/d given on Days 1 to 3. Neutropenia was found to be the DLT. Calcium
and magnesium infusions did not allow escalation of the oxaliplatin dose. The combination was well-tolerC 2008 American Cancer Society.

significantly myelotoxic, inducing thrombocytopenia that
often requires platelet transfusions and that can cause
severe hemorrhagic complications.22-26 Therefore, platinating agents that may offer equivalent antitumor activity
and a more acceptable spectrum of toxicity are of interest.
Oxaliplatin, trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH)
oxalatoplatinum, is a platinum agent that forms
DACH-platinum adducts with DNA.27 In preclinical
models, oxaliplatin is comparable to cisplatin in efficacy
and is active against several cisplatin-resistant cell
lines.28-30 The cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin in cisplatin-resistant cells may be due to the poor recognition of the
DACH-containing adducts by cellular DNA repair
pathways.27,31-33 In clinical trials, oxaliplatin has been
reported to cause little ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or
myelosuppression.34-40 Therefore, oxaliplatin may be
useful in sparing patients who require a platinating agent
from the toxicities of cisplatin, and also may be effective
in patients whose tumors are refractory to cisplatin. Furthermore, if oxaliplatin can be safely combined with etoposide, the combination may be as potent as the
combination of cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide.
As noted above, the combination of a platinating
agent and etoposide is active against many tumor types. In
vitro, cisplatin and etoposide demonstrate at least additive
and, in some systems, supra-additive, cytotoxicity.41-43
The cellular mechanism of this interaction is unclear, but
it is postulated that inhibition of topoisomerase II by etoposide decreases the ability of the cell to repair the DNA
damage caused by cisplatin (as demonstrated with the
combination of cisplatin and another topoisomerase II inhibitor, novobiocin44). When etoposide was combined
with topotecan in a colon cancer xenograft model,45 pretreatment with topotecan was found to increase cellular
levels of topoisomerase II and increase sensitivity to etoposide. When topotecan was removed, the levels of topoisomerase II returned to baseline as did the etoposide
sensitivity. In addition, in a model of mouse mammary
carcinoma, increased levels of topoisomerase II were
found to be correlated with increased etoposide sensitivity.46 In colon carcinoma cell lines, treatment with oxaliplatin caused an increase in topoisomerase II levels.47 This
effect of oxaliplatin on topoisomerase II levels may
increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the effects of etoposide, producing a clinically synergistic regimen similar
to the combinations of cisplatin with etoposide.

The most common toxicity caused by oxaliplatin is
peripheral sensory neuropathy, both acutely, around the
time of the infusion, and chronically, with higher cumulative doses.48 The acute neuropathy that is most often
dose-limiting is pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia (tingling,
numbness, and a sensation of having a lump in the
throat). This sensation is often accompanied by dysesthesia/paresthesia in the extremities and is exacerbated by exposure to cold temperatures.49 Acute sensory neuropathy
was the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in both of the pediatric phase 1 trials of oxaliplatin.36,40 To our knowledge
the mechanism of oxaliplatin-related neuropathy has not
been entirely elucidated to date, but there is evidence that
the oxalate molecule released during the metabolism of
oxaliplatin may affect the function of neuronal voltagegated Naþ channels.50,51 Carbamazepine, which is a Naþ
channel blocker, can ameliorate this acute neurotoxicity
without significant pharmacokinetic interactions with
oxaliplatin.52 However, because carbamazepine can
induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, there is a risk of significant pharmacokinetic interaction when administered
with etoposide.53 Other investigators have used calcium
and magnesium infusions to chelate the oxalate and
thereby reduce oxaliplatin-related sensory neuropathy.53
We conducted a pediatric phase 1 trial of the combination of oxaliplatin and etoposide using an oxaliplatin
dose that was previously determined to be safe in children
(130 mg/m2 every 3 weeks).40 Because treatment with
oxaliplatin may increase topoisomerase II levels and
thereby increase etoposide sensitivity, oxaliplatin was
administered first on Day 1 with etoposide given on Days
1 to 3. There are several platinum and etoposide regimens
described in children.1-5,9,12 We chose a 3-day regimen of
etoposide to decrease the risk of toxicity because there is
no clear benefit to a 5-day regimen. Calcium and magnesium infusions were used with oxaliplatin doses higher
than the single-agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in
an attempt to advance the oxaliplatin dose by ameliorating oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity.

MD (NSC 266046, IND 57,004)]), was reconstituted
in 250 to 500 mL of sterile water with 5% dextrose
and infused intravenously over 2 hours after an
antiemetic. Etoposide, obtained from commercial
suppliers, was infused intravenously over 1 hour daily for
3 days, beginning immediately after the oxaliplatin
infusion.
The initial dose level was oxaliplatin at a dose of
130 mg/m2 and etoposide at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day.
The second dose level was oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/
m2 and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day. The third
dose level was oxaliplatin at a dose of 145 mg/m2 and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day. To explore whether
the latter dose of oxaliplatin, which is greater than the
single-agent MTD, could be tolerated, calcium and magnesium infusions were administered to ameliorate oxaliplatin-associated neurotoxicity.53 Calcium chloride at a
dose of 10 mg/kg (maximum dose, 1 g) was infused over
30 minutes, and magnesium sulfate at a dose of 25 mg/kg
(maximum dose, 1 g) was then infused over 30 minutes
before each oxaliplatin infusion and after etoposide infusion on Day 1. The calcium infusions were not given if
the patient’s serum calcium concentration was 10.5 mg/
dL; the magnesium infusions were omitted if the serum
magnesium was 2 mEq/L. There was no intrapatient
dose escalation. Patients with reversible grade 3 toxicity
(with the exception of acute dysesthesia) or grade 4 electrolyte or hematologic toxicity (lasting >7 days) could
continue on protocol therapy with a reduction to the next
lower dose level. For patients treated at dose level 1, the
dose of oxaliplatin was reduced to 100 mg/m2. Patients
with grade 3 acute dysesthesia, including pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia, received subsequent doses infused over 6
hours. If the dysesthesia recurred, then the dose of oxaliplatin was decreased by 1 dose level. Recurrent toxicity
requiring a second dose reduction resulted in removal
from protocol therapy.
At least 3 evaluable patients were treated at each
dose level. If 1 of 3 patients at a given level experienced a
DLT, 3 more were accrued at that level. If 2 of these
patients experienced DLT, the MTD was exceeded and
the next 3 patients were treated at the next lower
dose level. The MTD was the dose level at which no
more than 1 patient experienced DLT and was 1 level less
than the dose level at which 2 of 3 to 6 patients

Patient Evaluation
A medical history, physical examination, serum electrolytes, and renal and liver function tests were obtained for
each patient before enrollment, weekly during the first
course of therapy, and before each subsequent course.
Routine complete blood counts were obtained twice
weekly during the first course and weekly thereafter.
Female patients of childbearing age were tested for pregnancy before each course. Echocardiography, electrocardiography, and audiography were performed before
enrollment, after the first course, and at completion of
study therapy.
Adverse events were assessed according to the NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE; version 3.0).54 A nonhematologic DLT was
defined as any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity in the
first course that was attributable to protocol therapy, with
the exclusion of grade 3 nausea and vomiting, grade 3 liver
enzyme elevation that returned to  grade 1 before the
next course, and grade 3 fever or infection. A hematologic
DLT was defined as grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting >7 days in the first course. Any persistent
toxicity attributable to the chemotherapy that prevented
the initiation of the second course within 28 days after the
start of the first course was considered to be dose-limiting.
Patients underwent disease-appropriate evaluations
for response within 2 weeks before study entry, after the
second course of therapy, and after every third course
thereafter. If a patient had a documented response, studies
were repeated after the next course. Patients without
measurable or evaluable disease at study entry were monitored for disease recurrence. Tumor response was determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST),55 with the exception of brain
tumors.
For patients with brain tumors, complete response
(CR) was defined as the disappearance of all demonstrable
tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. A partial response
(PR) was defined as a 50% reduction in the sum of the
product of the maximum perpendicular dimensions of all
measurable lesions on MRI, with no new lesions and sta658

was defined as worsening neurologic status not explained
by other causes, an increase >25% in the product of the
maximum perpendicular dimensions of any lesions, evidence of new lesions, or a requirement for increasing doses
of corticosteroids to maintain a stable neurologic status.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as a response that did not
meet the criteria for any of the other categories. CR, PR,

of corticosteroids accompanied by stable or improving
neurologic status.

RESULTS
From December 2004 to December 2006, 16 patients
were enrolled, all of whom were evaluable for toxicity (Table 1). All patients had measurable or evaluable disease,
except 1 with a fourth recurrence of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) who underwent macroscopic total
resection before study entry. A total of 63 courses of therapy were administered (median, 3 courses; range, 1-13
courses).

Table 3. Hematologic Toxicities

Of the first 3 patients treated at dose level 1, 1 experienced
dose-limiting grade 3 pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia at
the time of completion of the 2-hour oxaliplatin infusion
(Table 2). These symptoms resolved within 30 minutes.
The same patient experienced prolonged grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 epistaxis while thrombocytopenic during the first course of treatment. He tolerated a second
course with a reduced oxaliplatin dose infused over 6
hours; however, he was removed from protocol therapy
for PD after the second course. None of the subsequent 5
patients treated at dose level 1 experienced a DLT. At
dose level 2, none of the first 3 patients experienced a
DLT. At the third dose level, 1 of 3 initial patients experienced dose-limiting neutropenia. The fourth patient enrolled also experienced dose-limiting neutropenia,
indicating that the MTD had been exceeded, and that
level was closed to accrual. Three additional patients were
subsequently enrolled at dose level 2 and did not experience a DLT. Thus, dose level 2 (130 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin
and 100 mg/m2/day 3 of etoposide) was the MTD.
Two patients experienced serious toxicities that
occurred after the first course of treatment and therefore
were not considered dose-limiting. One patient with ependymoma experienced a life-threatening anaphylactic
reaction followed by a generalized seizure. After multiple
anticonvulsants, he required intubation for apnea and
admission to the intensive care unit. He recovered and
was removed from protocol therapy. Another patient with
neuroblastoma, who had received a nonmyeloablative
allogeneic bone marrow transplant, developed grade 3 diarrhea during course 2 that improved with loperamide.
During his response evaluation at the end of the course,
pneumatosis intestinalis was noted incidentally. He was

antibiotics, bowel rest, and parenteral fluid support. The
radiographic findings resolved within 3 weeks. No infectious etiology was identified. The patient was removed
from protocol therapy.
The hematologic toxicities are summarized in Table
3. The median duration of grade 4 neutropenia was 7 days
(range, 2 days-14 days) and the median duration of grade
4 thrombocytopenia was 6 days (range, 2 days-8 days).
The most common grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities were sensory neuropathy, vomiting, hypophosphatemia, and diarrhea (Table 4), all of which had an incidence
of <10%. None of the patients treated at dose level 3 (an
oxaliplatin dose greater than the single-agent MTD) in
conjunction with calcium and magnesium infusion experienced dose-limiting pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia. Six
patients (1 at dose level 1, 4 at dose level 2, and 1 at dose
level 3) required a reduced oxaliplatin infusion rate
because of acute sensory neuropathy during or immediately after a dose. The patients tolerated subsequent

was no evidence of ototoxicity. No patient had a significant increase in serum creatinine.

Antitumor Activity
Of the 16 patients, 7 experienced PD during the first 2
courses and withdrew from the study. The patient with
recurrent ATRT without evaluable disease, whose previous therapy had included cisplatin and etoposide, had a
sustained disease-free interval through 11 courses. She
developed disease recurrence 3 months after electively
withdrawing from therapy. Two patients had prolonged
confirmed SD. One patient with recurrent ependymoma
experienced SD for 14 courses and continued to have stable residual disease at the time of last follow-up, 15
months after electively withdrawing from therapy. The
other patient, who had high-grade metastatic sarcoma,
experienced SD for 5 courses, then chose to pursue other
therapy. Two patients, 1 with neuroblastoma and 1 with
ependymoma, achieved SD after 2 courses of therapy but
developed PD after 5 courses. Another neuroblastoma
patient had SD after 2 courses but was then removed from
protocol therapy due to toxicity. A patient with recurrent
pineoblastoma sustained a PR through 5 courses of therapy (Fig. 1) but withdrew due to worsening myelosuppression. One patient with recurrent medulloblastoma

DISCUSSION
The MTD of the 2 agents in this combination regimen
was oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m2 (Day 1) and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2/d (Days 1-3). The most
common DLT was neutropenia lasting >7 days. Grade 4
neutropenia occurred in 37% of all courses and grade 4

significant infectious complications reported during the
periods of neutropenia and only 2 episodes of febrile neutropenia. Other notable toxicities included acute sensory
neuropathy associated with oxaliplatin; this toxicity was
ameliorated by reducing the oxaliplatin infusion rate.
Although cumulative neuropathy is well described in
patients receiving oxaliplatin, none of our patients withdrew from the study due to worsening neurologic symptoms. Of the 4 patients who electively withdrew, 3 did so
because they were enjoying a good quality of life and
wished for a respite from chemotherapy. The fourth
patient disliked the avoidance of cold beverages. None of
these patients found the toxicity of therapy too
burdensome.
The most common DLT of oxaliplatin given every 3
weeks in the single-agent pediatric phase 1 study was acute
sensory neuropathy, including pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia, at a dose of 160 mg/m2.40 This toxicity appeared
to improve with concomitant carbamazepine; however,
carbamazepine caused significant toxicity in 1 patient.
Because intravenous calcium and magnesium infusion
Cancer

were reported to reduce the incidence and severity of acute
oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity,53 we attempted to
advance the dose of oxaliplatin beyond the single-agent
MTD by using this approach. It is unclear whether these
infusions were helpful: 5 of 15 patients receiving a dose of
130 mg/m2 and 1 of 4 patients receiving a dose of 145
mg/m2 required reduction of the oxaliplatin infusion rate
due to acute neurotoxicity. This rate of acute neurotoxicity is similar to the pediatric single-agent phase 1 trial in
which 2 of 8 patients experienced grade 3 acute neurotoxicity in the first course at a dose of 130 mg/m2 administered over 2 hours.40 After accrual to this study was
completed, a randomized study of calcium and magnesium infusions in patients with colorectal cancer receiving
oxaliplatin was terminated because of decreased tumor
response in the group randomized to receive the infusions56; however, those results were not confirmed by an
independent radiology review.57 We did not find that the
use of calcium and magnesium infusions allowed escalation of the oxaliplatin dose with this regimen. Neither
should carbamazepine be used for this purpose because it
interacts pharmacokinetically with etoposide.58 In 1
study, patients with a specific polymorphism of glyoxylate
aminotransferase, an enzyme involved in oxalate metabolism, appeared to have a higher risk of acute neurotoxicity.59 In the future, pharmacogenomics may help
physicians to predict which patients are at increased risk
of oxaliplatin-associated toxicity. Because there are no
studies addressing the efficacy of a 6-hour oxaliplatin infusion, the best approach appears to be an initial infusion of
oxaliplatin over 2 hours, with a reduction of the infusion
rate in patients who experience acute neurotoxicity.
The combination of oxaliplatin and etoposide demonstrated potential evidence of antitumor activity, especially in patients with central nervous system (CNS)
malignancies. Three patients with recurrent embryonal
tumors (medulloblastoma, ATRT, and pineoblastoma,
respectively), all of whom had previously been treated
with cisplatin and etoposide, had significant clinical benefit with the combination regimen; 2 patients achieved
objective responses and a third had a sustained diseasefree interval after surgical resection. An additional patient
with ependymoma had SD through 14 courses of therapy.
The reported response rate for pediatric patients with
recurrent embryonal brain tumors was approximately 5%

single-agent etoposide.60 Although our patient cohort was
small, the objective response rate of 40% (2 of 5 patients)
reported in patients with recurrent embryonal brain
tumors shows promise, and toxicity was manageable.
Notably, both patients with objective responses had failed
after treatment with regimens that contained both cisplatin and etoposide. With the reported lack of ototoxicity or
nephrotoxicity, 2 of the significant long-term toxicities in
cancer survivors treated with cisplatin,61-63 the regimen of
oxaliplatin and etoposide deserves further evaluation. A
formal phase 2 study would be needed to determine
whether this combination produces better response rates
than either agent alone.
Overall, this regimen appears safe and the antitumor
effects, especially in embryonal CNS malignancies, warrant further evaluation. Support with filgrastim may
ameliorate the most common toxicity, neutropenia.
Future studies may include a phase 2 study of oxaliplatin
and etoposide, especially in children with brain tumors.
We also plan to assess the addition of ifosfamide to this
regimen, beginning 1 dose level below the MTD due to
the potential for an increased incidence of neutropenia.
