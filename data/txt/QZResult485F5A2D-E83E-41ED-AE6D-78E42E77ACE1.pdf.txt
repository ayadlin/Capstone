BACKGROUND: To quantify the magnitude of benefit of the addition of hormone treatment (HT) to exclusive radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer, a literature-based meta-analysis was conducted.
METHODS: Event-based relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived through a random-effect model. Differences in primary (biochemical failure and clinical progression-free survival) and
secondary outcomes (cancer-specific survival, overall survival [OS], recurrence patterns, and toxicity) were
explored. Absolute differences and numbers of patients needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. A heterogeneity test, a metaregression analysis with clinical predictors of outcome, and a correlation analysis for
surrogate endpoints were also performed. RESULTS: Seven trials (4387 patients) were gathered. Hormone
suppression significantly decreased both biochemical failure (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.82; P < .0001) and
clinical progression-free survival (RR, 0.81; 95% CI 0.71-0.93; P ¼.002), with absolute differences of 10% and

addition of HT, without significant heterogeneity, with absolute differences of 5.5% and 4.9%, respectively,
which translates into 18 and 20 NNT. Local and distant relapse were significantly decreased by HT, by 36%
and 28%, respectively, and no significant differences in toxicity were found. Primary and secondary efficacy

Hormonoradiotherapy for Prostate Cancer/Bria et al

Androgen deprivation through hormone sup-

Outcome Definition

pression with luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone
(LH-RH) analogues remains the cornerstone of treatment
for patients with hormone-sensitive advanced prostate
cancer.1 Clinical studies have shown that 17% to 64%
of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who
receive radiotherapy alone experience clinical progression, and 26% to 43% die within 5 years of initiating
treatment.2-4
Antiandrogen therapy has an independent cytotoxic
effect on prostate cancer cells, and the rationale for combining androgen deprivation with radiation is to act as a
‘‘sensitizer’’ for radiation to enhance tumor cell kill, and
to eradicate micrometastatic disease beyond the radiation
volume. The optimal duration of androgen ablation therapy remains controversial, despite a growing number of
prognostic factors that have been shown to predict disease
outcome.
With respect to the timing of androgen deprivation in early stage disease, multiple studies have now
been conducted to establish the potential benefit of
androgen deprivation therapy combined with radiotherapy (RT).
Seven randomized trials have reported on the use of
neoadjuvant androgen deprivation or concurrent hormone suppression in conjunction with RT.5-14 These
studies have demonstrated an overall survival advantage
with the addition of hormone suppression or antiandrogen to RT, using various treatment schedules in patients
with intermediate and high risk. However, given the relatively long natural history of the disease, it takes a considerable amount of time for clinical trials to provide mature
data; therefore, the validation of reliable surrogate endpoints is an emerging priority.15
To quantify the potential benefits of hormone therapy (HT) combined with RT in terms of progression-free
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific
survival, a meta-analysis was conducted.

The combination of HT and RT was considered as the experimental arm, and exclusive RT as the standard comparator. Analysis was conducted to find significant
differences in primary and secondary outcomes, according
to the reported sequence and definitions in the selected
trials. Primary outcomes for the magnitude of the benefit
analysis were both biochemical failure, time between randomization and prostate-specific antigen increase) and
clinical PFS (clinical progression-free survival, time
between randomization and clinical appearance of local
and/or distant relapse or death by any cause). Secondary
endpoints were: 1) cancer-specific survival (time between
randomization and death for prostate cancer), 2) OS
(time between randomization and death by any cause), 3)
local failure rate, 4) distant metastases rate (DM), 5) overall grade 3-4 toxicities, 6) genitourinary grade 3-4 toxicity
(GU), 7) gastrointestinal grade 3-4 toxicities (GI), and 8)
cardiac deaths.
A sensitivity analysis taking into account treatment
duration was accomplished by evaluating the effect of HT
on efficacy outcomes in trials adopting either long-term
(1 year) or short-term (< 1 year) treatment duration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The analysis was conducted following 4 steps: definition
of the outcomes (definition of the question the analysis
was designed to answer), definition of the trial selection
criteria, definition of the search strategy, and a detailed
description of the statistical methods used.16,17

Search Strategy
Deadline for trial publication and/or presentation was
November, 2008. Updates of randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) were gathered through Medline (PubMed,
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed), American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO, www.asco.org), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO, www.esmo.org),
Federation of European Cancer Societies (www.fecs.be),
and American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO, www.astro.org) website searches. Keywords used for searching were: adjuvant hormone
therapy, prostate cancer, radiotherapy, review, meta-analysis, meta-analysis, pooled analysis, randomized, phase 3,
comprehensive review, and systematic review. In addition
to computer browsing, the reference sections of review
and original articles were also scanned for missing trials.
Furthermore, lectures at major meetings (ASCO, ESMO,
European Cancer Conference [ECCO], and ASTRO)
having ‘‘hormone treatment and radiotherapy for prostate
cancer’’ as the topic were checked. No language restrictions were applied.

Trial Identification Criteria

Correlation

Included were all prospective phase 3 RCTs published in
peer-reviewed journals or presented at the ASCO,
ECCO, ESMO, and ASTRO meetings before November
2008, in which previously untreated patients with locally
advanced prostate cancer were prospectively randomized
to receive exclusive RT (control arm) or HT (hormone
suppression with LH-RH analogues or antiandrogen)
plus RT (experimental arm), regardless of drug, schedule,
dosages, duration, and RT technique.

Potential correlations to test surrogacy between primary
endpoints and cancer-specific survival/OS were explored
according to a linear regression model considering both
the outcome rates for each single arm and the calculated
RRs and their logs for each outcome in paired comparisons. Correlations were estimated according to the Pearson (r) and R2 coefficients (parametric) and the Spearman
(q) coefficient (nonparametric).
Power Analysis

Data Extraction
The number of events for primary and secondary endpoints were extracted; the last trial’s available update was
considered as the original source. All data were reviewed
and separately computed by 5 investigators (E. B., F. Cu.,
D. G., I. S., and P. C.).

Data Synthesis
The log of relative risk ratio (RR) was estimated for each
considered endpoint,18 and 95% confidence intervals
were derived.19 A random-effect model according to the
inverse variance and the Mantel-Haenzel method was
preferred to the fixed, given the known clinical heterogeneity of trials; a Q-statistic heterogeneity test was
used. Absolute benefits for each outcome were calculated (ie, absolute benefit ¼ exp [RR  log{control
survival}]  control survival20; modified by Parmar and
Machin21). The number of patients needed to treat for
1 single beneficial patient was determined (NNT: 1/
[{absolute benefit}/100]).22 Results were depicted in all
figures as conventional meta-analysis forest plots; an RR
< 1.0 indicates fewer events in the experimental arm. To
find possible correlations between outcome effect and
negative prognostic factors (selected among trials’
reported factors: lymph node-positive, Gleason score
between 7 and 10, and tumor size T3-T4 rates), a metaregression approach was adopted (ie, regression of the
selected predictor on the log RR of the corresponding
outcome). Calculations were accomplished using SPSS
software, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) and the
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software, version v. 2.0
(Biostat, Englewood, NJ).17
3448

To evaluate if the performed meta-analysis has enough statistical power to determine the obtained results, a sample
size determination was accomplished. Given that differences in median survival across the included trials ranged
widely, and to assess how many patients would eventually
be required to determine the benefit, a model to calculate
the target sample size for a cancer-specific survival benefit
of 3%, 4%, 6%, and 7%, using either biochemical failure
or clinical progression-free survival beta coefficients
according to the regression, was accomplished.

RESULTS
Selected Trials
Eleven trials (7535 patients) were identified5,7,8,10-14,23-25
(Fig. 1). One paper reported the results of 2 trials8; 1 was
excluded because it was designed to compare HT duration
without an exclusive RT arm. Three additional RCTs
were excluded for the same reason.23-25 Seven and 5
RCTs, respectively, were evaluable for biochemical failure
(3956 patients, data lacking for 179 patients) and clinical
progression-free survival (4020 patients, data lacking for
2 RCTs8,13). With regard to secondary outcomes, 1 trial
(161 patients) was excluded for lack of data.8 Six RCTs
(4266 patients) provided data for cancer-specific survival,
OS, and cardiac deaths. Data were available for local
failure rate, DM, and toxicity analyses in 4 RCTs (2650
patients with 2 trials excluded,12,13 and 2050 patients
with 2 trials excluded,7,12 respectively). HT was administered according to an long-term or short-term approach
in 35,10,12,14 and 47,8,11,13 trials, respectively. Trials characteristics are listed in Table 1. Median follow-up ranged
from 4.5 to 10.1 years.

Combined Analysis
Primary outcomes

HT significantly decreased biochemical and clinical
failure over exclusive RT by 24% and 19%, respectively.
The absolute benefit was 10% for biochemical failure and
7.7% for clinical progression-free survival, corresponding
to 10 and 13 NNT, respectively (Table 2). The benefit
was obtained regardless of HT duration, as shown by the
sensitivity analysis (Table 2, Fig. 2).

Secondary outcomes

HT significantly reduced the risk of death for prostate cancer by 24%, without significant heterogeneity.
This corresponds to an absolute benefit of 5.5%, with 18
NNT (Table 2). In the sensitivity analysis, the absolute
benefit in cancer-specific survival ranges from 5.3% in the
long-term trials to 7.2% in the short-term trials. HT significantly decreased the risk of death by any cause by
14%, regardless of treatment duration, with an absolute
benefit of 4.9%, corresponding to 20 NNT (Table 2).
With regard to recurrence, both local relapse (LR) and
DM were significantly decreased (36% and 28%, respectively) by the addition of HT to RT, with a 9.8% and
9.5% absolute benefit, corresponding to 11 NNT (Table
2). No significant differences in toxicities and cardiac
Cancer

deaths were observed by comparing the 2 arms, without
heterogeneity (Table 3).
According to the metaregression analysis, none of
the considered predictors significantly affected outcome,
with the exception of lymph node positivity and Gleason
score, which significantly influenced clinical progressionfree survival (Table 4).

Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis was performed in 6 RCTs, in
which biochemical failure could be considered as a potential surrogate for survival, and in 5 RCTs, which considered clinical progression-free survival. Both primary
outcomes significantly correlated with either cancer-specific survival or OS, regardless of the adopted coefficients
(Table 5). The correlations between the log of the RRs of
primary outcomes and the RRs of cancer-specific survival
and OS are shown in Figure 3.

Power Analysis
On the basis of power calculations, 6209, 3467, and 1085
patients would have been required to demonstrate a statistically significant cancer-specific survival benefit of 3%,
4%, and 7%, respectively. With >4000 patients to

demonstrate a 5.5% absolute cancer-specific survival benefit, the present meta-analysis largely exceeds the statistical
power required (1487 patients needed to determine a 6%
cancer-specific survival benefit).
We also derived a model to calculate the numbers of
patients needed to demonstrate a 3%, 4%, 6%, and 7%
absolute improvement in cancer-specific survival, using
biochemical failure or clinical progression-free survival as
surrogate endpoints; given the correlation between surrogate endpoints and cancer-specific survival (Table 5 and
Fig. 3), the target cancer-specific survival improvements
correspond to a 5.3%, 7.1%, 10.6%, and 12.4% improvement and to a 5.6%, 7.5%, 11.2%, and 13.1% improvement for biochemical failure and clinical progression-free
survival, respectively. By using such surrogate endpoints
instead of cancer-specific survival as a target for trial
design, the corresponding required sample sizes would be
2321, 1327, 603, and 447 patients, and 2220, 1254, 569,
and 442 patients, respectively.

DISCUSSION
The present meta-analysis demonstrates that the administration of hormone-suppressive therapy in patients
affected by prostate cancer who are candidates to receive
exclusive RT significantly improves all investigated outcomes. Although with significant heterogeneity in many
of the endpoints, the overall absolute benefit is in the
range of 7.5% to 10% in favor of HT for both primary
outcomes, biochemical failure and clinical progressionfree survival (Table 2). The choice of biochemical failure
and clinical progression-free survival as primary endpoints
is justifiably arguable; however, it was supported by their
incorporation into the primary endpoint of most of the
trials considered, as well as by a general drive toward the
use of surrogate endpoints in oncology. Although a literature-based meta-analysis cannot deeply investigate the
surrogacy of an endpoint over another, the correlation
rates clearly indicate that both primary endpoints significantly correlate with the more clinically valuable outcomes of cancer-specific survival and OS (Table 5, Fig. 3).
Indeed, in addition to biochemical failure and clinical
progression-free survival, survival of patients receiving
HT is increased, with an absolute reduction in deaths due
to prostate cancer or deaths due to any cause of 5.5% and
4.9%, respectively. Although data on LR and DM were

available for only a small subset of the patient population
considered, the risk of local recurrences and distant metastases were also significantly decreased.
To easily understand the impact of absolute benefits,
we also calculated the NNT. Indeed, this method offers
an immediate perspective of the magnitude of benefit
achievable by implementing a specific medical intervention, and improves the quality of cumulative analyses.26,27
In the medical oncology scenario, adjuvant treatments
rarely provide absolute benefits (5%-10%, depending on
the outcome considered) and NNTs10-20 are found in the
range of those observed in the present meta-analysis (Table 2 and Refs. 28, 29), calling for rapid and extensive
implementation of HT in addition to definitive RT in the
daily clinical practice.
Although comparing the duration of hormone suppression was neither an endpoint of the individual RCTs
considered nor within the scope of the present meta-analysis, this particular subject was preliminarily explored
with a sensitivity analysis approach, in light of its potential
relevance for daily clinical practice. No statistically significant interaction was found between duration of hormone
suppression (long-term or short-term) and any of the outCancer

comes considered, indicating that HT benefit is consistent
across all trials, regardless of treatment duration (Table 2).
According to Sharifi et al,1 the benefits of the combination of hormone suppression and radiotherapy must be
‘‘carefully weighed against substantial risks and adverse
effects on quality of life.’’ Although no statistically significant differences in toxicity were observed (Table 3), the
31% to 34% reduction in the RR of GU and GI toxicities
observed for patients receiving the combined treatment
suggests that the addition of HT to RT may actually prove
beneficial in a larger trial population. With regard to treatment duration, data are insufficient (4 trials) to reliably
evaluate its impact on treatment tolerability; however,
long-term seems to significantly increase the risk of both
GU and GI morbidity for patients treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT.30 Obviously, RT dose plays a dramatic role, and the optimal hormone treatment duration
to be combined with >70 grays RT is currently not established. Although the addition of short-term (< 1 year)
neoadjuvant/concurrent androgen deprivation therapy to
a very high radiation dose did not appear to confer a therapeutic advantage but added side effects and cost,31 escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy with neoadjuvant

androgen suppression appears clinically worthwhile in
terms of PFS and decreased use of salvage androgen

The issue of toxicity is particularly important in light
of recent warnings of increased mortality when adding HT
to RT in prostate cancer.33-35 The Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database suggested that neoadjuvant/adjuvant HT was associated with higher rates of

was observed in the subset of men who underwent a partial
response, but not in the overall study population.36 A
pooled analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials of RT
with or without androgen deprivation therapy for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer also showed that
HT was associated with shorter time to fatal myocardial
infarction in a statistically significant fashion.6,7,24 However, such association was observed only in the subset of
men older than 65 years.33 A competing risk analysis discriminating cardiac events (and deaths) as a function of
age and HT in an individual patient data meta-analysis
would actually be required to solve this issue. According to
the results reported herein, no significant difference in
terms of cardiac deaths was observed when comparing
exclusive RT with HT þ RT (Table 3); therefore, whether
the suggested higher rate of cardiac events is due to HT or
patient age remains unknown.

patients receiving RT and provided suggestions for the
future trials,4 this is the first meta-analysis weighing the
effect of the addition of HT to exclusive RT by gathering
those trials specifically designed to answer this question. A
recent meta-analysis has analyzed the effect of neoadjuvant HT before surgery (14 RCTs) or RT (4 RCTs).37
According to the authors, the optimal schedule and/or duration of treatment still remain a subject of further studies;
however, neoadjuvant HT should use ‘‘the quickest and
most potent combination for restricted time periods.’’37
The conclusions in favor of the combination strategy should be softened in view of the discrepancies in trial
number, sample size, treatment duration, and patients’
risk profile, as well as in light of known biases of
literature-based meta-analyses.38 Such caveats notwithstanding, the magnitude of benefits and evidence demonstrating the absence of major differences between
individual patient data and abstracted data meta-analyses,
when dealing with a similar patient sample,39 strongly
indicate that the results can be considered ‘‘carefully reliable.’’ In the case of the present meta-analysis, this is further supported by the power analysis, demonstrating that
the sample analyzed largely exceeds that required to reliably determine the observed differences in outcomes.
An exploratory metaregression analysis, with all its
limitations, did not identify clinical predictors with a significant impact on benefit from HT, with the exception of
lymph node positivity and Gleason score only with regard
to the clinical progression-free survival outcome (Table 4).
This issue is of paramount importance in determining
which patients would benefit from a combined treatment
strategy, and could be appropriately assessed only in the

Although the results of the current study confirm
and quantify the benefit of adding hormone suppression
to exclusive RT for patients with locally advanced prostate
cancer, a ‘‘road map’’ to identify which patients really benefit from such strategy and what is the optimal duration of
treatment needs to be drawn. In this regard, gene and molecular profiling play an increasingly important role in the
prognostic and predictive classification of prostate cancer.
