ABSTRACT:

The biguanide metformin, a widely used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes,
may exert cancer chemopreventive effects by suppressing the transformative and
hyperproliferative processes that initiate carcinogenesis. Metformin’s molecular
targets in cancer cells (e.g., mTOR, HER2) are similar to those currently being
used for directed cancer therapy. However, metformin is nontoxic and might be
extremely useful for enhancing treatment efficacy of mechanism-based and
biologically targeted drugs. Here, we first revisit the epidemiological, preclinical,
and clinical evidence from the last 5 years showing that metformin is a promising
candidate for oncology therapeutics. Second, the anticancer effects of metformin
by both direct (insulin-independent) and indirect (insulin-dependent) mechanisms
are discussed in terms of metformin-targeted processes and the ontogenesis of
cancer stem cells (CSC), including Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and
microRNAs-regulated dedifferentiation of CSCs. Finally, we present preliminary
evidence that metformin may regulate cellular senescence, an innate safeguard
against cellular immortalization. There are two main lines of evidence that suggest
that metformin’s primary target is the immortalizing step during tumorigenesis.
First, metformin activates intracellular DNA damage response checkpoints. Second,
metformin attenuates the anti-senescence effects of the ATP-generating glycolytic
metabotype-the Warburg effect-, which is required for self-renewal and proliferation
of CSCs. If metformin therapy presents an intrinsic barrier against tumorigenesis
by lowering the threshold for stress-induced senescence, metformin therapeutic
strategies may be pivotal for therapeutic intervention for cancer. Current and
future clinical trials will elucidate whether metformin has the potential to be used
in preventive and treatment settings as an adjuvant to current cancer therapeutics.

on the development of cancer in diabetic patients and the
specific survival of those patients have most likely been
underestimated because an estimated 3-5% of the adult
population is thought to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes
[6]. In a recent review and meta-analysis of all-cause
mortality of patients with pre-existing diabetes, Peairs et
al. [7] reported that patients with both breast cancer and
diabetes had a significantly greater risk of death (i.e., 49%)
compared with their nondiabetic counterparts. Although
Peairs’ study could be inaccurate due to the fact that over
40% of people age 20 or older have undiagnosed prediabetes or a delayed diagnosis of diabetes [8], Barone et
al. [9] similarly observed a statistically significant increase
in the risk of death in breast, endometrial, colon and
rectal cancer patients who have diabetes compared with
nondiabetic cancer patients. In newly diagnosed cancer
patients, the prevalence of diabetes ranges from 8% to
18%, and diabetes is significantly associated with breast
cancer in women [10], regardless of body mass. It should
be acknowledged, however, that diabetes mellitus is not
a homogeneous disease. Most studies on cancer patients
have included patients with type 2 diabetes in part because
of its high prevalence (i.e., 90% of all diabetes patients
have type 2 diabetes) and because cancer is predominantly
a disease of the elderly, a stage in life when type 2 diabetes
is more frequent. Type 2 diabetes has metabolic and
hormonal characteristics that differ from those in type 1
diabetes. Additionally, hyperglycemia and endogenous
hyperinsulinemia can coexist for a long period, including
during pre-diabetes. Importantly, strong evidence points
toward insulin resistance and associated mitogenic
hyperinsulinemia as a direct pathway connecting diabetes,
obesity and metabolic syndrome with cancer.

can bind with different affinities the IR or the IGF-1R.
Therefore, the activation of both receptors by insulin leads
to the induction of two major intracellular transduction
cascades, resulting in growth and enhanced survival.
The survival pathway involves multiple anti-apoptotic
targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/
serine/threonine kinase AKT signaling pathway, and the
proliferation pathway involves activation of the mitogenactivated kinases MEK and ERK [4].

DIABETES AND CANCER (II): INSULIN
RESISTANCE
AND
METABOLIC
SYNDROME
Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients is
a consequence, at least in part, of the upregulation of
cytokines and free fatty acid derivatives that activate the
inflammatory cascade and protein kinase C-zeta (PKCzeta), a serine/threonine kinase that acts downstream
of the PI-3K and insulin signaling pathways. PKC-zeta
phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and
impairs the ability of IRS-1 to activate PI-3K in response
to insulin [12]. Because PKC-zeta is located downstream
of IRS-1 and PI-3K in established insulin signaling
pathways, PKC-zeta may participate in a negative
feedback pathway that promotes hyperglycemia. It should
be noted that in contrast to type 1 diabetic patients, insulin
resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes does not involve
the “proliferation/mitogenic” pathway. As a consequence,
the administration of exogenous insulin or insulinmimetic compounds to type 2 diabetic patients might
hyperactivate IR-driven mitogenic signaling, increasing
the overall cancer risk in these patients. Activation of the
IGF-1R by insulin can also significantly contribute to an
increased risk of cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Additionally, obesity is linked with diabetes and cancer
and increases the incidence of colon, esophageal and
breast carcinomas. While type 2 diabetes is linked with
obesity, which increases insulin resistance and accelerates
diabetes progression [13, 14], insulin resistance leads to
an enhanced sensitivity to the mitogenic effects of insulin,
leading to a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients.
Metabolic syndrome includes the following risk
factors: high blood pressure, insulin resistance, obesity
(especially abdominal obesity), and dyslipidemia. After
following postmenopausal breast cancer patients who had
not received chemotherapy, Pasanisi et al. [15] concluded
that the risk of recurrence increased three-fold in women
suffering from metabolic syndrome. Flanagan et al. [16]
recently observed that metabolic syndrome was linked to a
poor prognosis and overall survival in men with recurrent
or newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. Thus,
metabolic syndrome is associated with a shorter time to

DIABETES AND CANCER (I): INSULIN
RECEPTORS
The membrane-bound receptor of insulin (IR) is a
heterotetrameric protein that consists of four subunits;
two subunits protrude from the cell surface and bind
insulin, and the other two subunits span the membrane and
protrude into the cytoplasm. Insulin binds to its receptor
on the cell surface, causing a conformational change in the
membrane-spanning subunits, which have tyrosine kinase
activity. There are two isoforms of the IR, namely IR-A
(also called fetal IR) and IR-B, which are produced by
alternative splicing. The IR-A isoform is the predominant
form in cancer cells because it can elicit mitogenic
rather than metabolic effects [11]. Insulin-like growth
factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), which shares approximately
60% homology with IR, is a transmembrane tyrosine
kinase activated by the binding of its ligand (IGF-1)
and promotes mitogenic, metastatic, and anti-apoptotic
phenotypes in breast cancer. The insulin and IGF-1
pathways are closely intertwined because both ligands

the need for clinical trials to confirm the potential antineoplastic activity of metformin, as the preclinical and
clinical evidence currently available for standard practice
is largely lacking (Fig. 1).

METFORMIN: FROM DIABETES TO
CANCER
Anti-diabetic metformin: A definition

Metformin and cancer: Epidemiological evidence

Metformin is a semi-synthetic biguanide with two
methyl groups attached to the nitrogen nucleus of biguanide.
This compound is derived from the hypoglycemic
substance galegine, which is found naturally in goat’s
rue (Galega officinalis). Additionally, metformin is used
to stimulate the activity of the mammary glands and is a
diuretic used as an adjuvant for the treatment of diabetes.
Metformin has been approved for use in the treatment
of hyperglycemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
and metabolic syndrome. After oral administration, it
is absorbed into the body within 1-3 hours, and 90% is
eliminated by the renal system. Metformin decreases
glucose absorption in the intestine and glucose production
in the liver but does not stimulate insulin secretion.
Consequently, it increases the uptake and utilization
of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. The
lowering of blood glucose levels by metformin is only
observed in people with diabetes and insulin resistance
but has no effect on healthy people, except those who
have been subjected to prolonged fasting. Metformin also
increases the affinity of the insulin receptor for insulin,
reduces hyperinsulinemia and improves insulin resistance.
Several days after administering the drug, insulin levels
are reduced by 25-33% in both diabetic and nondiabetic
patients. Metformin can also decrease fatty acid uptake
and oxidation in skeletal muscle cells while lowering
circulating levels of total cholesterol, Low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides. Additionally, in
contrast to sulfonylureas, metformin promotes weight loss
(approximately 2 kg), and once weight loss is achieved,
weight loss is maintained. Generally, metformin is well
tolerated, with only 5% of patients being intolerant.
Its side effects are mild and reversible gastrointestinal
disorders (30%); metallic taste (3%), which is reversible
with continued use, and decreased levels of B12 in 6% of
patients after 29 weeks. Metformin is a safe drug with a
low risk of lactic acidosis, which affects 3 out of 100,000
people per year (50% of which are fatal). Renal failure,
congestive heart failure and an age greater than 80 years
are factors associated with the highest risk group.
Between June 2010 and June 2011, 31 reviews
were indexed in PubMed on “metformin and cancer.” A
recent review published in Clinical Science discussed the
implications of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in
the development and progression of cancer [17]. Here, we
will report the most relevant publications supporting the
potential benefit of metformin as a novel multi-faceted

Many studies have found a lower incidence of and
mortality from cancer in diabetic patients who have been
treated with metformin. Examples include the large,
retrospective study by Bowler et al. [18] that involved
patients who had been treated with either metformin
or sulfonylurea for a period of at least 5 to 5.5 years.
This group determined that metformin was associated
with lower overall mortality (3.5% versus 4.9% for the
sulfonylurea cohort) and mortality as a result of cancer (an
HR of 1 for metformin and no insulin use versus an HR
of 1.3 (CI 1.1-1.6) for the sulfonylurea group). A Dutch
labor prospective observational trial recently followed
patients who had used metformin and other anti-diabetic
agents for 9.6 years [19]. In total, 1300 patients were
followed; 289 had been treated with metformin, and 1064
had been treated with another drug. This group found that
metformin use was associated with lower mortality due to
cancer with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% CI 0.230.80), and this association was dose-dependent, resulting
in a 42% probability of mortality due to cancer for every
1 g increase in the metformin dose. Additionally, Currie
et al. [20] observed a decrease in the diagnosis of cancer
in patients taking insulin and metformin. Another metaanalysis found a 31% reduction in the cancer rate in patients
taking metformin and found that this relationship was also
dose-dependent [21]. In a retrospective study of type 2
diabetic patients, Evans et al. [22] found reduced cancer
rates in patients who had been treated with metformin, and
this relationship was again dose-dependent. In this study,
the cancer incidence decreased more than 50% (adjusted
odds ratio of 0.56; 95% CI of 0.43-0.74) if the patients had
been treated with metformin for more than 4 years.
The treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with
metformin has also been reported to lower mortality due
to several solid tumor types. Although little is known
about the effect of metformin on human colorectal
carcinogenesis, recent epidemiological studies have
shown reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in patients
with type 2 diabetes taking metformin when compared
with those patients who do not take metformin [20, 2325]. Patients with colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas
who had been treated with metformin showed a 30%
improvement in survival when compared with patients
who had been treated with other anti-diabetic treatments
[25-27]. In patients with hepatocellular carcinomas
who had been treated with radiofrequency, diabetes was
associated with lower survival rates versus nondiabetic
patients, but metformin users had better survival

outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.24; 95% CI of 0.070.80) [28]. More importantly, treatment with drugs other
than metformin and a tumor size larger than 2.5 cm were
independent variables associated with lower survival rates
in the entire studied population. Early epidemiological
studies suggested an inverse relationship between diabetes
and prostate cancer [5, 29, 30]. Accordingly, a 44% risk
reduction of prostate cancer incidence in Caucasian men
on metformin therapy has been reported in a populationbased case-control study [31]. However, Patel et al. [32]
recently reported that metformin use does not have a
significant beneficial effect after prostate cancer diagnosis.
Recently, a retrospective study published by
Jiralerspong et al. [33] showed an increase in the
effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast
cancer patients who took metformin concomitantly with
systemic therapy in patients with and without diabetes.
Specifically, diabetic patients who had been treated with
metformin had a pathologic complete response (pCR) rate
three times higher (24%) than those who had not been
treated with metformin (8%). Importantly, the rate of pCR
in patients without diabetes was 16%. Although metformin
use has been shown to associate with a decreased risk of
breast cancer in the long term [34, 35], the overall survival
rate was the same as in nondiabetic women despite a
higher pCR rate in the metformin-treated group [33].
Bayraktar et al. [36] observed that triple negative breast
cancer patients who did not receive adjuvant metformin
and nondiabetic patients tended to have a higher risk of
distant metastases compared with the metformin-treated
group. Their findings, however, suggest that metformin
use during adjuvant chemotherapy does not significantly
impact survival outcomes in diabetic patients with highly
aggressive triple receptor-negative breast cancer. In the
first line of chemotherapy treatment for advanced lung
cancer, diabetic patients who were being treated with
metformin demonstrated better overall survival and
longer progression-free survival and disease control [37].
Although diabetes is associated with a lower incidence
of prostate cancer, mortality from prostate cancer is
higher in type 2 diabetic patients [38]. Recently, the
MD Anderson Cancer Center presented a retrospective
study of 233 diabetic patients with prostate cancer. This
multivariate analysis analyzed obesity, PSA, grade, age,
and use of diabetes drugs and showed that treatment
with thiazolidinedione and metformin were significant
predictors of improved survival (HR: 0.45 and 95% CI:
0.21-0.9; HR: 0.55 and 95% CI: 0.31-0.96, respectively)
[39].

suggesting that people with type 2 diabetes receiving
metformin demonstrate a lower risk and improved
outcomes with most common cancers, caution is needed
when directly translating these findings to clinical cancer
prevention and treatment. Most of these studies were
retrospective, clinical, or hospital based and, therefore,
susceptible to selection bias. For instance, several studies
did not exclude individuals with prior cancers; moreover,
patients who received metformin significantly differed in
many key factors from those who did not receive the drug
closely related to cancer risk, including age, obesity, and
smoking history. Despite these methodological limitations,
both the epidemiological findings and the suspected
anti-cancer effects of metformin have contributed to the
interesting hypothesis that metformin may exert clinically
relevant effects in the primary and secondary prevention of
human carcinomas. The anti-cancer effects of metformin
based upon its dual action on systemic insulinemia (i.e.,
maintaining glucose levels and insulin at physiological
levels in the plasma) and its direct, targeted action against
cancer cells (with pleiotropic inhibitory effects on multiple
pathways involved in survival and metastasis) [40] need
to be further studied.

Metformin and the ATM/LKB1/AMPK axis
Metformin largely exerts its effects by activating
5’ adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein
kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a major metabolic sensor
involved in regulating cellular energy homeostasis. In
conditions of cellular stress (e.g., glucose deprivation,
hypoxia, oxidative stress, or ischemia), the ratio of AMP/
ATP increases, which induces the activation of AMPK.
Once activated, AMPK inhibits anabolic processes that
require energy and activates catabolic processes that
produce energy. The activation of AMPK is mediated
by other proteins including the enzymes LKB1 (i.e.,
the serine-threonine kinase STK11), CaMKK (calcium/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) and TAK1 (TGFβ-activated protein kinase 1) [41-44]. Indeed, the tumor
suppressor LKB1 (one of the most commonly mutated
genes in lung and pancreatic cancers and melanomas)
can mediate the action of metformin on AMPK activity
[45-47]. The absence or decreased expression of LKB1
in human breast carcinomas is associated with poor
prognosis [48], which suggests that the inhibition of
tumorigenesis by metformin may depend on the status of
LKB1 [49]. However, a recent study in mice found that
hyperinsulinemia-mediated loss and/or mutation of LKB1
is a predictor of sensitivity to metformin [50].
A polymorphism in the LKB1 gene is associated
with ovulatory response to treatment of Polycystic
Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) patients with metformin
alone in a prospective randomized trial [51]. Additionally,
genetic polymorphisms in the cell surface transporter
organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), which is required

for the efficient action of metformin, have been shown
to underlie metformin resistance in some patients with
type 2 diabetes and PCOS [52-54]. Although it is likely
that OCT gene polymorphisms may significantly affect
the efficacy and toxicity of metformin against human
cancer cells [55], this remains to be confirmed. Recently,
a region in the ATM gene (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated)
that modulates the response to metformin in type 2
diabetic patients was discovered [56-58]. ATM is a tumor
suppressor gene implicated in DNA repair and cell cycle
control. The authors of this study concluded that ATM is
required for the full anti-glycemic activity of metformin.
ATM phosphorylates LKB1 and other components of
the insulin pathway but can also modulate the activation
status of AMPK independent of LKB1 [59-61]. This
suggests that an unexpected relationship with DNA
repair pathways may explain, at least in part, metformin’s
efficacy against cancer cells. Using cultured tumor cells,
we recently confirmed that metformin promotes activation
of ATM and ATM targets, such as the protein kinase
Chk2, suggesting a causal linkage between metformin’s
mechanism of action and metformin’s cancer preventative
effects [62].

death in cancer cells [75-77].
Metformin and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR)
mTOR is involved in regulating cellular energy
homeostasis by modulating the activity of different
cellular processes such as protein synthesis and autophagy
[78-80]. mTOR plays a critical role in cell growth and
tumorigenesis in different tumors, and its activation
correlates with cancer progression, adverse prognosis
and resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly-targeted
therapies [81-84]. mTOR activation occurs frequently
in breast cancer and results in a poorer prognosis. The
activated form of AMPK inhibits mTOR activity via the
phosphorylation and stabilization of the tumor suppressor
tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TCS2). As such, metformin
inhibits the mTOR-signaling pathway in an AMPKdependent manner, which may provide an explanation
of the observed anti-neoplastic actions in breast cancer
[85-88]. In other tumors where mTOR plays an important
role, including renal cell carcinomas, a mechanism by
which metformin inhibits tumorigenicity via mTOR and
activation of AMPK has been demonstrated [89]. Based
on these data, a combination of therapies directed against
AMPK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways has emerged
as an option for the treatment of cancer [82, 90]. The
combination treatment of temsirolimus and metformin in a
phase I clinical trial on solid tumors was feasible with only
one grade 1 hyperglycemia case [91]. It should be noted
that mTOR inhibition might also occur in the absence of
AMPK activation, for example, by inhibiting IGF1, the
insulin receptor and AKT [92]. Therefore, metformin can
inhibit mTOR by decreasing the levels of insulin or IGF1
independent of AMPK.

Metformin and endogenous lipogenesis
One of the consequences of AMPK activation is
the inhibition of lipogenesis in malignant lesions. Tumor
cells require high levels of de novo fatty acid synthesis,
and the most aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer
have a high rate of lipid metabolism also dependent on
and involved in proliferation and cell survival [63-65].
Furthermore, tumor induction by certain oncogenes
causes the activation and expression of enzymes for
the de novo synthesis of fatty acids such as acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN).
Notably, inhibition of exacerbated lipogenic metabolism
in tumor cells might result in inhibition of the activity and
expression of upstream oncoproteins [66-68]. The effects
of metformin on energy homeostasis in normal and cancer
cells have been characterized by the blocked activation
or expression of key fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes
(e.g., ACC, FASN, HMGCR) and enhanced expression
of regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., PCG-1α)
[69-74]. Together, these effects on energy homeostasis are
expected to significantly contribute to the antiproliferative
activity of metformin by inhibiting endogenous fatty
acid biosynthesis and shifting cellular bioenergetics to
catabolism. Such changes in lipid metabolism have been
demonstrated experimentally using several FASN and
ACC blockers to inhibit growth and induce apoptotic cell

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Metformin and estradiol
Active AMPK inhibits the expression of the
aromatase gene in breast adipose tissue by decreasing
the local production of estrogen [93]. Furthermore, obese
patients with breast cancer exhibit a higher expression
of this gene and higher levels of estrogen in breast tissue
as a result of increased plasma leptin synthesis, which is
caused by obesity. Leptin inhibits AMPK by increasing the
expression of aromatase; however, adiponectin activates
AMPK. Therefore, metformin-based treatments aimed at
activating AMPK and restoring the leptin/adiponectin axis
may decrease the occurrence of breast cancer in obese
patients.
Metformin and the mitotic cell cycle
AMPK is involved in the process of cell division.
Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that the
phosphorylated form of AMPK has a space-time dynamic
during mitosis, as it is located at the centrioles during the
initial stages and in the constriction ring during the final
stages of mitosis [94-96]. Metformin also decreases the
expression of many genes involved in mitosis including
900

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 896 - 917

kinesins, tubulins, histones, auroras and polo-like kinases
[97]. Therefore, the chronic activation of AMPK by
metformin alters mitosis, and the severity of these changes
may depend on the status of p53 [98]. Specifically, chronic
activation of AMPK leads to the activation of p53 and
cellular senescence. Inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation
with metformin has been suggested to increase glycolysis
and autophagy in cells bearing native p53. Conversely,
cancer cells with a mutated p53 that have been treated
with metformin are unable to reprogram metabolism, and
the cell undergoes apoptosis [99].
Metformin and apoptosis: Impact on chemotherapeutic
efficacy
Metformin increases the cytotoxicity of some
drugs. In breast and lung cancer cell lines, metformin and
paclitaxel synergistically induce cell cycle arrest, and the
combination increases the number of cells in the G2/M
phase, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation independent of
LKB1 [100]. Additionally, in ovarian cancer, metformin
inhibits tumor growth in nude mice in a dose-dependent
manner and reduces the number of lung metastases,
proliferation (determined by Ki-67), vascular density
and angiogenesis as measured by VEGF [101]. More
importantly, the effects were synergistic with cisplatin
treatment. Lliopoulos et al. [102] also demonstrated
a synergistic antitumor effect of metformin with
cisplatin, doxorubicin and paclitaxel in an animal model.
Additionally, metformin induces both caspase-dependent
and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-dependent cell death
in breast cancer cells [103].
Metformin and oncogenes: Impact on targeted cancer
therapy
Metformin treatment has been shown to efficiently
inhibit endogenous initiation and progression of
spontaneous mammary tumors in HER2-transgenic mice
[104, 105]. Additionally, metformin decreases the levels
of HER2 activity and expression in cell lines in a dosedependent manner. At low doses (in the micromolar
range), the HER2 tyrosine kinase activity is blocked,
but expression levels are not affected [87]. At higher
concentrations (in the millimolar range), the expression
of HER2 protein is downregulated [106]. Furthermore,
the metformin-induced inhibition of HER2 is independent
of the molecular mechanism that contributes to the
overexpression of HER2 (i.e., gene amplification or
transcriptional activation) [106]. Metformin has different
effects on gene expression depending on whether a cell
line is HER2-positive or HER2-negative [97]. In HER2negative breast cancer cell lines, the expression of genes
related to mitosis is decreased in response to metformin.
Meanwhile, in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines
treated with metformin, genes involved in apoptosis are
overexpressed. Although ongoing clinical-translational
research is required to provide evidence for the usefulness of
therapeutically combining metformin with HER2-targeted

Figure 1: Metformin and cancer: From phenomenology
to molecular understanding in less than a decade.

Since an initial report by Evans et al. [22] revealing that
metformin use in people with type 2 diabetes was associated
with reduced cancer incidence, the hypothesis that metformin
may have clinically relevant preventive and treatment effects
in human cancer exploded as an ever-growing research field, as
scientists discovered mechanistic connections to pivotal cancer
markers and even cancer stem cells. Amazingly, the molecular
and clinical breakthroughs in metformin and cancer have taken
place during only the past decade.

therapies [107], it is worth mentioning that metformin acts
synergistically with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab (Herceptin™) to eliminate stem/progenitor
cell populations in HER2-gene amplified breast carcinoma
cells growing as mammospheres [108]. Moreover,
metformin treatment efficiently reverses secondary
resistance of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells to the
dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib
(Tykerb™) by suppressing pro-survival pathways (i.e.,
the anti-apoptotic protein survivin) [109-111].
In HER2-positive tumors, metformin has a dual
effect: 1) inhibiting the activity/expression of the HER2
onco-tyrosine kinase and 2) blocking the action of mTOR,
a possible mechanism of resistance to trastuzumab [88,
112]. Additionally, by decreasing the levels of circulating
insulin and IGF, activation of the IGFR pathway will be
avoided. Because transactivation of the IGFR pathway is
a well-recognized mechanism underlying de novo (i.e.,
primary) [113] and acquired (i.e., secondary) [114, 115]
resistance to anti-HER2 therapies, metformin’s ability to
simultaneously target HER2, while preventing increased
IGF-IR signaling may represent a potential therapeutic tool
in breast carcinomas resistant to HER2-directed therapy.
In support of this, a recently conducted pre-clinical study
with trastuzumab-sensitive parental breast cancer cell lines
(i.e., BT474 and SKBR3) and trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer sublines (i.e., BT-474-HR20 and SKBR3-pool2)
showed that metformin treatment causes significantly
more inhibition of proliferation and clonogenicity in
trastuzumab-resistant sublines via disruption of HER2/
IGF-IR complexes (which are solely present in the
resistant sublines) [116]. Importantly, this effect occurred
without altering HER2 expression or reduction of IGF-IR
expression or activity in the trastuzumab-resistant but not
in the sensitive breast cancer cells. The activity of AMPK
in cardiac cells is associated with stress-induced survival
in response to cytokines or energy depletion. Thus, the
concurrent blockage of oncogenic receptors such as
HER2, while activating AMPK-related catabolic pathways
with metformin would be a highly efficacious therapy
to prevent, delay and/or reverse resistance to the HER2
inhibitor while decreasing the risk of cardiomyopathy
[109, 117].

that population studies have mostly been retrospective
and confined to diabetic patients, in whom factors that
are relatively unimportant in the general population may
have significant roles [118]. Indeed, there is still a lack
of retrospective clinical evidence for antitumor activity
of metformin in nondiabetic patients. Because an ideal
strategy for cancer prevention should employ a limited
course of low-toxicity therapy to suppress premalignant
lesions in high-risk cancer patients, forthcoming studies
should focus on the clinical application of metformin
and/or other metformin-related biguanides as suppressors
of premalignant lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues.
Metformin-based, large-scale cancer prevention trials
would be more justifiable with strict criteria specifying
high-risk populations in which metformin is expected to
provide a greater clinical benefit [119, 120]. Metformin’s
ability to increase the mean lifespan of tumor-free
mice while simultaneously decreasing the risk of agerelated death underscores its ability to reduce cancer
incidence among type 2 diabetics. Evans et al. [22]
reported that the risk of subsequent cancer diagnosis
was significantly reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes
receiving metformin and that metformin’s protective
effect was increased with metformin use (i.e., dose and/
or time of metformin treatment). Furthermore, a recently
conducted retrospective study reported an impressive
56% decrease in the risk of breast cancer among diabetics
receiving metformin when compared with diabetics
being treated with other anti-diabetic therapies [121]. In
addition, available data have revealed that reductions in
cancer mortality related to metformin use are similar in
magnitude to reductions in cancer incidence, suggesting
that the anti-cancer effects of metformin largely depend
on (or are restricted to) its preventive effects [119].

Mechanisms of metformin cancer prevention (I):
Cancer stem cells
Because high levels of IGF-1 and estradiol can favor
the generation and/or maintenance of mammary tissuespecific stem cells [122], pharmacological measures
to enhance insulin sensitivity (e.g., metformin) might
significantly reduce the risk of metastatic progression
in premalignant lesions. Breast stem cell niches not
only support the self-renewal and maintenance of stem
cell identity but also control stem cell number and
proliferation [123]. If regulators of niches also function
as mitogens for the reservoir of undetected, pre-invasive
breast cancer lesions and/or dormant cancer stem cells
[CSCs] within premalignant lesions in situ [124, 125]),
then metformin’s ability to decrease systemic metabolic
biomarkers including insulin, IGF-1 and estradiol would
regulate generation and/or maintenance of mammary stem
cells and/or their niches. As such, this would regulate
the number and proliferation rate of tumor progenitors

residing at premalignant lesions. Evidence for this CSCcentered hypothesis underlying breast cancer prevention
by metformin is the observation of increased breast cancer
risk within 2 years in diabetic women receiving the insulin
analog glargine [126-128]. Hormonal factors influencing
the natural history of breast cancer (e.g., insulin, IGF-1,
estradiol) could have effects in very short amounts of time.
Therefore, the increased breast cancer risk in glargine users
likely reflects the growth of subclinical malignant lesions
to clinically diagnosable volumes rather than the initiation
of new tumors [129]. As such, metformin’s inhibitory
effects on CSC-like subpopulations in intraepithelial
neoplasias might prevent invasive carcinomas including
breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women [120,
130].
The theory of CSCs (also called tumorinitiating cells) suggests that tumors consist of two
cell subpopulations. CSCs have the capacity to selfrenew while giving rise to other distinct phenotypic
subpopulations upon differentiation, which contributes
to cellular heterogeneity within human tumors [131133]. Presumably, tumor relapse is due to the intrinsic
chemoresistance of CSCs. Therefore, drugs that attack
both the tumorigenic subpopulation of CSCs and the more
differentiated and proliferating population could efficiently
prevent disease recurrence [134, 135]. A landmark study
that demonstrated the effect of metformin on CSCs was
conducted by Hirsch et al. [136] using mice with a human
breast cancer xenograft. Metformin treatment was found
to specifically eliminate CD44+/CD24-/low CSCs and had
a synergistic effect with doxorubicin, which resulted in
reduced tumor burden and delayed tumor recurrence
and was more effective than either agent alone [136].
Furthermore, metformin combined with doxorubicin/
cisplatin or paclitaxel delayed tumor relapse better than
either agent alone. Surprisingly, the combination was
effective with a four-fold lower dose of doxorubicin, thus
decreasing the toxicity of chemotherapy and improving its
efficiency. In this case, metformin could be preventing the
dedifferentiation of tumor cells to CSCs [102].
Given that metformin appears to act on a subpopulation
of tumor stem cells, it seems reasonable that more
aggressive breast cancer subtypes enriched with CSC-like
features, such as basal-like (triple negative) and HER2
cells, would be more sensitive to the action of metformin
[88]. Recently, we found that proliferation and size of
CSC multicellular “microtumors” (i.e., mammospheres)
in non-adherent and non-differentiating conditions were
inhibited by metformin, indirectly reflecting metformin’s
ability to suppress stem cell renewal and progenitor
cell proliferation, respectively [108]. Perhaps more
importantly, metformin treatment appears to significantly
alter the genetic and/or epigenetic plasticity of CSCs
because it can resensitize mammosphere-initiating cells
to HER2-targeted drugs [108]. Furthermore, we recently
confirmed that among the different molecular classes of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

breast cancer, triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cells
are significantly more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory
effects of metformin [137-139]. In the triple-negative
breast cancers, metformin has been shown to suppress
the metastasis-associated protein and breast CSC marker
CD24 [139], suggesting a therapeutic role for metforminbased regimens in the clinical management of highly
metastatic subgroups of triple-negative/basal-like breast
carcinomas naturally enriched with CD24-positive tumorinitiating cells [140-142].

Mechanisms of metformin cancer prevention (II):
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
microRNAs
The EMT has been established as a mechanism for
the acquisition of stem cell characteristics (self-renewal
and tumor initiation) [143-147]. Differentiated cancer
cells lose their polarity, thus acquiring the properties of
mesenchymal mobility, which allows a cell to leave the
epithelial layer through the basal lamina and reach the
bloodstream, thus permitting metastatic progression.
Cancer-associated EMT cells lose epithelial characteristics,
such as the expression of E-cadherin, while acquiring de
novo expression of mesenchymal-associated genes. In
breast carcinomas, these cells express the CD44+/CD24-/
low
mesenchymal immunophenotype on the cell surface
[148]. In highly metastatic basal-like MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells, our group has shown that metformin
treatment dynamically suppresses the CD44+/CD24-/low
CSC phenotype via transcriptional repression of the EMT
machinery including Transforming Growth Factor-β1,
ZEB, TWIST and SLUG (SNAIL2) [149]. Metforminmediated regulation of E-cadherin can efficiently prevent
the TGFβ-induced conversion of epithelial cells into
migratory mesenchymal cells [150]. This treatment
maintains the location of E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell
contact and prevents the cellular changes (morphology
and size) associated with a mesenchymal status.
Therefore, metformin treatment could be a useful strategy
to impede the formation of migrating CSCs [120] (Fig.
2A). We have recently proposed that metformin can alter
micro(mi)RNA-regulated cell differentiation to prevent
the invasion of human carcinomas. Invasion/metastasis
of epithelial carcinomas including breast cancer can be
viewed as a miRNA lethal-7 (let-7)-regulated continuum
of progressive dedifferentiation (i.e., EMT) with a cell at
the endpoint that has stem cell-like properties [151, 152].
As such, metformin’s ability to upregulate let-7 expression
in premalignant cells may efficiently push them to become
less “embryonic” (i.e., mesenchymal stem-like cells) and
more “normal” (i.e., non-stem differentiated epithelial
cells). This could block the dynamic nature of cellular
transformation and CSC formation in response not only
to oncogenes but also to the local microenvironment [120,

cells against malignant transformation [154-156].
Senescent cells can be found abundantly in intraepithelial
premalignant lesions, whereas senescent cells are scarce
in invasive, life-threatening metastatic carcinomas,
supporting the notion that cellular senescence suppresses
cancer in vivo. Dismantling the senescence response (e.g.,
via inactivation of the tumor-suppressor p53) causes a
significant acceleration in the development of human
tumors, whereas senescence in established malignant states
is associated with tumor regression [157]. Senescence-

Figure 2: Metformin: A guardian of EMT and micro(mi)RNA-regulated stemness and cancer progression. A. EMT

Induction of the EMT transdifferentiation program in cancer cells results in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. The
emergence of CSCs also occurs in part as a result of EMT. In addition, EMT of tumor cells contributes to drug resistance. Figure depicts
how metformin’s ability to inhibit the EMT transdifferentiation program may represent a therapeutic strategy to clinically overcome
chemotherapy refractoriness in CSCs-enriched invasive/metastastic carcinomas. B. Two evolutionary conserved families of miRNAs, let7 and miR-200, regulate pivotal differentiation processes during development. On the one hand, loss of let-7 in cancer triggers reverse
embryogenesis and dedifferentiation phenomena. On the other hand, miR-200 has been identified as a powerful regulator of the EMT
process. The figure depicts how deregulation of let-7 and miRNA-200 during carcinogenesis could each contribute to tumor progression,
one by controlling let-7 regulated oncofetal genes (LOGs) and, therefore, stem cell maintenance, and the other by regulating EMT and,
therefore, the generation of migrating CSCs. Obviously, crosstalk exists between loss of let-7 –that results in reverse embryogenesis and
dedifferentiation- and miR-200-regulated EMT –that results in up-regulation of a number of stem cell markers-. Metformin, through its
ability to potentiate the expression of let-7a [153] and miR-200 (unpublished observations) and to prevent the overexpression of classical
EMT markers such as ZEB, TWIST and SLUG (SNAIL2) [149], may function as an efficient molecular guardian against cancer progression
and/or tumor recurrence after treatment.

inducing stressors such as oxidative damage, DNA
damage and/or oncogenes normally trigger senescence
at the premalignant tumor stage [158]. In agreement with
an active role of cellular senescence in cancer prevention,
the subsequent invasion of premalignant lesions almost
inevitably involves one or more events that inhibit or impair
the senescence pathway. For instance, the convergence of
EMT-driven acquisition of stem cell characteristics with
enhanced autophagy in response to bioenergetic stresses
may turn premalignant phenotypes into tumor-initiating
cells that bypass metabolic stress- and oncogene-induced
cellular senescence [120, 125, 159-161]. Metformin’s
ability to enhance senescence in established premalignant
disease or to trigger cellular senescence in fully malignant
invasive disease is an unexplored mechanism that may
explain metformin-mediated cancer prevention and
treatment.

response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents
in culture and in vivo. Because of this, it is tempting to
suggest that, in the context of DDR, metformin-enhanced
cellular senescence may underlie metformin’s ability to
increase the rate of pCR in neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
diabetic patients with breast cancer [33] and to promote
tumor regression and prevent relapse when combined
with suboptimal doses of chemotherapy in animal models
[102]. In primary murine embryonic fibroblasts from wildtype (p53+/+) mice, we recently tested whether metformin
can regulate the senescence-like growth inhibition induced
by doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging drug that induces
cell senescence at concentrations significantly lower
than those required for inducing apoptosis. Exposure
to metformin increased the senescent subpopulations in
control (untreated) cells and synergistically increased
the cell senescence in response to doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage [161]. It would also be relevant to
evaluate whether metformin facilitates the “accelerated
senescence” triggered in normal cells by the expression
of mutated, transforming versions of oncogenes (e.g., Ras
or Raf) and by some other forms of supraphysiological
mitogenic signaling irrespective of senescenceinhibiting adaptations (e.g., inactivation of p53) [170172]. Proliferative invasive cancer cells with activated
oncogenes acquire instrumental mechanisms to suppress
senescence in early stages of cancer pathogenesis (e.g., in
in situ lesions); organisms in which cells fail to undergo
senescence die prematurely of cancer [173]. Therefore,
activating the program of senescence in tumor cells is an
attractive approach to cancer treatment [157, 174] and
may help to explain the differential impact of metformin
on cancer incidence in non-prone and cancer-prone animal
models and perhaps also in cancer-prone individuals. It
remains to be elucidated, however, whether metformin’s
ability to strongly activate the ATM/Chk2-regulated DDR
checkpoint [62] is a critical event that prevents neoplastic
epithelium to progress unimpeded into invasive cancer in
individuals without type 2 diabetes.

Mechanisms of metformin-induced cellular senescence
(I): Enhanced DNA Damage Response (DDR)-like
signaling
In recent years, evidence has emerged that DNA
Damage Response (DDR) is one of the earliest molecular
events that impedes the multistep progression of human
epithelial carcinomas to invasive malignancy. DNA
damage can be due to a variety of factors such as telomere
dysfunction and oncogene-induced “replication stress”
[162-164]. Accordingly, there is a strong selective
pressure for mutation in DDR components because
activation of DNA damage checkpoints acts as the innate
barrier against invasion/metastasis of tumors [162, 165].
Because the DDR is a major component of the innate
tumor suppressor barrier in early human tumorigenesis,
selective activation of DDR surveillance mechanisms
may therefore directly contribute to metformin’s cancer
preventive effects. It would be interesting to test whether
metformin can significantly increase senescence in
premalignant lesions of the skin, the lung, the pancreas
or the breast. Epithelial cells within premalignant breast
lesions with markers of senescence maintain an intact
response to cellular stress and are less likely to develop
subsequent tumor events. In other words, the presence
of functional pro-senescence mechanisms is the most
accurate predictor of recurrence and progression of
premalignant lesions in situ (e.g. in Ductal carcinoma in
situ [DCIS] of the breast) to invasive basal-like breast
carcinomas [166]. This evidence is valuable pre-clinical
framework for pro-senescence metformin-based antibreast cancer therapies, which could be evaluated in DCIS
xenografts before and during the spontaneous transition to
invasive breast cancer lesions [167-169]. As such, we are
currently assessing whether cancer risk with metformin
treatment is related to its ability to activate DNA damagelike signaling that induces specific senescence-like growth
inhibition of premalignant or malignant cells without
altering the normal function of non-neoplastic tissues.
Many tumor cells retain the ability to senesce in

Mechanisms of metformin-induced cellular senescence
(II): Senescence bioenergetics in CSCs
It now appears that metformin can be added
to the growing list of agents that have potent cancer
chemopreventive properties by activating DDR signaling.
Ongoing experiments in our laboratory have shown
that chronic exposure to metformin drastically reduces
the lifespan of non-transformed human fibroblasts by
accelerating replicative cellular senescence (unpublished
observations). In the presence of a constant mitogenic
input, metformin treatment promotes an inappropriate
culture environment that determines a new threshold
level of negative signals rapidly surpassed and caused
accelerated stress-induced senescence. Because culture
conditions induce DNA damage in cultured human
fibroblasts, metformin-accelerated replicative senescence
905

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 896 - 917

may mostly rely on the ability of metformin to establish a
stronger DDR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Alternatively,
a lower threshold for stress-induced senescence due
to metformin can be explained in terms of metforminregulated energy metabolism. The most widely accepted
interpretation for the biological function of cellular
senescence is that it serves as a mechanism for restricting
cancer progression. Based on this, escaping from cellular
senescence and becoming immortal constitutes an
additional step in oncogenesis that most tumors require
for their ongoing proliferation [175]. Recent studies have
suggested that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and oxidative damage are commonly involved in
culture stress- or oncogene-induced senescence. Because
increasing accumulation of ROS is observed during
replicative senescence (i.e., the replicative potential of both
murine and human fibroblasts is significantly higher under
low oxygen), the ability of immortalized cells including
embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) and CSCs to buffer oxidative stress may be pivotal

for explaining their immortality [176-179]. Early studies
by Warburg [180] found that most cancer cells metabolize
glucose by enhanced glycolysis even in the presence of
ample oxygen, despite the fact that this generates ATP
less efficiently than the aerobic processes of respiration
and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which mainly
occur in mitochondria. Glycolysis, which produces lactate
from pyruvate, occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm
and generates ATP more rapidly than respiration, which
might offer a selective advantage to rapidly growing
tumor cells. Thus, enhanced glycolysis even under 20%
oxygen culture conditions is a characteristic property of
most cancer cells and is known as the Warburg effect.
Although there have been limited mechanistic insights
into the relationship between the Warburg effect with the
well-characterized molecular and genetic events of cellular
immortalization, we are beginning to accumulate evidence
suggesting that the two phenomena are linked [176-179].
First, the glycolytic flux declines during senescence both
in murine and human fibroblasts, while the expression

Figure 3: Metformin-targeted EMT and tumor metabolism: Novel strategy against CSCs. Top. Oncogenic stimuli can

either induce senescence or EMT, depending on the cellular and microenvironmental context. Conversely, EMT-inducing transcription
factors can simultaneously suppress oncogene-induced senescence (OIS)-like responses and induce an EMT, both phenomena contributing
to malignant progression because EMT generates migrating CSCs by directly linking enhanced cellular motility with the maintenance of
tumor-initiating (stemness) capacity. Bottom. Rather than constituting a feature of malignancy per se, enhanced aerobic glycolysis and
shifts in cellular metabolism away from mitochondrial respiration are intimately linked to malignancy at the level of CSCs. Enhanced
glycolysis may play a causal role in the immortality of CSCs by protecting them from the senescent effects of mitochondrial respirationinduced oxidative stress. Metformin’s ability to concomitantly attenuate the anti-senescence effects of both the EMT program and the ATPgenerating glycolytic metabotype-the Warburg effect- may result in a phenotypic shift that impedes cancer oncogenesis by down-regulating
self-renewal and proliferation of CSCs.

of glycolytic enzymes can modulate cellular lifespan in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [176, 181]. Second,
enhanced glycolysis can protect cells from oxidative
stress and, consequently, avoid senescence triggered by
oxidative stress [176]. Third, mouse embryonic stem
cells, immortalized MEFs and iPSCs have surprisingly
low rates of mitochondrial O2 consumption accompanied
by a high glycolytic rate. Indeed, the a priori energetic
infrastructure of somatic cells appears to be a crucial
molecular feature for pluripotency because enhancing a
bioenergetic shift from somatic oxidative mitochondria
toward an alternative ATP-generating glycolytic process
maximizes the efficiency of somatic reprogramming to
pluripotency [179, 182]. Fourth, enhanced glycolysis
plays an important role in the proliferative potential
of stem cells; accordingly, they are hypersensitive to
glycolytic inhibition and, once differentiated, they stop
proliferation and drastically reduce their glycolytic flux.
Altogether these data support the hypothesis that enhanced
glycolysis actively protects cells from senescence induced
by oxidative stress, a metabolic protection that might
causally contribute to the maintenance of the self-renewal
capacity of stem cells. The enhanced glycolysis of the
Warburg effect is a crucial metabolic feature that helps
bypass senescence, and this may provide indirect evidence
that metformin’s primary target is the immortalizing step
during tumorigenesis (Fig. 3). During immortalization,
several biological events are required beyond bypassing
senescence such as growth factor independence, evasion
of apoptosis, anti-growth signals, etc. If enhanced
glycolysis is necessary and sufficient to enable indefinite
proliferation (i.e., immortalization) very early during
multi-step carcinogenesis in vivo, then metformin’s
ability to inhibit the glucose flux while simultaneously
stimulating the lactate/pyruvate flux and mitochondrial
biogenesis must cause ATP depletion accompanied by
a drastic increase in cellular AMP, which is expected to
induce premature senescence [183].

crypt foci via the inhibition of the mTOR pathway and
through the activation of AMPK [184]. Based on these data,
Hosono et al. [185] recently conducted a pilot clinical trial
providing evidence that short-term, low-dose metformin
(250 mg once daily for 1 month versus the typical 500
mg three times daily in type 2 diabetes) safely and
directly suppresses both colorectal epithelial proliferation
and aberrant crypt formation, an endoscopic surrogate
marker of colorectal cancer, in prospectively randomized
nondiabetic patients [185]. The gastrointestinal tract
may be a special case where metformin appears to act
locally from the lumen following oral administration;
this raises the question of whether one could expect more
enhanced benefits by achieving more continuous exposure
to metformin (e.g., using the low-release metformin
preparations developed for dosing convenience).
This first reported trial demonstrated the potential for
metformin in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.
These findings were extended to lung tumors in the
tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridil)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung cancer mouse
model. Using this model, Memmott et al. [186] recently
demonstrated that treatment with high-dose metformin
remarkably decreased tumor burden (∼70%) without
affecting tumor incidence, providing strong rationale for
clinical prevention trials for lung cancer in heavy smokers.
While there was no evidence of metformin-induced
activation of AMPK in lung tumors, metformin led to
decreased levels of circulating insulin and IGF as well as
decreased phosphorylation of IGF-IR, AKT and mTOR
in tumor tissue. Thus, the profound effects on tumor
growth may have been a consequence of perturbation of
glucose homeostasis and hormone levels leading to the
indirect inhibition of mTOR by decreasing activation of
IR/IGF-IR and AKT upstream of mTOR. A completely
different picture was observed in a study with chemically
induced mammary cancer in female Sprague-Dawley rats.
Zhu et al. [187] reported that while a dosing regimen of
1.0%/0.25% metformin was capable of reducing palpable
mammary carcinoma incidence, multiplicity and tumor
burden and prolonged latency, lower doses of metformin
failed to inhibit carcinogenesis despite reducing plasma
insulin. Notably, metformin appeared to offer protection
against new tumor occurrence following release from the
combined treatment of metformin with dietary energy
restriction. Because flow cytometry analyses indicated
the presence of tumor-initiating cells in chemically
induced mammary carcinomas, these findings support the
hypothesis that metformin may be an effective component
of multi-agent interventions against CSCs [187].

Metformin and cancer prevention: Pre-clinical
evidence
Over the next 5 to 10 years, the results of ongoing
and planned metformin-based cancer studies will become
available. Although it is anticipated that they will provide
clinically relevant information regarding the actual effect
of metformin on risk and outcomes in many common
human cancers, pre-clinical studies can still provide crucial
information on mechanisms of metformin’s anticancer
activity. These data could potentially facilitate the use of
metformin as a novel agent for targeted cancer prevention.

biguanide metformin has suggested its unexpected use
in oncology. It is unknown whether metformin would
provide protective effects in people without diabetes, and
we are still lacking additional physiologically relevant
experimental models to elucidate whether the effects are
via direct suppression of mTOR signaling in malignant
(subclinical) or premalignant cells and/or by decreasing
the levels of circulating hormones (which may promote the
growth of malignant cells). However, a number of clinical
trials examining the use of metformin as a cancer therapy

are currently underway in prostate, breast, endometrial,
and pancreatic cancer patients [188-194]. As auspiciously
suggested by Dowling et al. [195], “the initiation of
new, focused clinical trials containing strong correlative
science components will be crucial in understanding the
effects of the drug on a range of cancer patients (including
non-diabetic patients) and the identification of biomarkers
that predict metformin benefit and response to therapy.”
Chemoprevention studies with metformin should ideally
target patients with a high risk of developing cancers, such

Figure 4: Metformin lowered threshold for senescence: Better protection and treatment against cancer. With increasing

levels of senescence-inducing stress (e.g., oncogenes, DNA damage, oxidative damage), tumor development goes through three stages
namely pre-tumoral, pre-malignant and malignant tumor stages. The stressors normally reach sufficient intensity to trigger senescence
only at the pre-malignant tumor stage. If the critical point for triggering senescence can be lowered by metformin by promoting DDRlike signals and/or impeding anti-senescence phenotypes (e.g., EMT, glycolytic metabotypes) in pre-tumoral (top) or tumoral (bottom)
tissues, metformin treatment could translate into better protection against cancer (i.e., metformin’s cancer prevention modality, top) and
could impede progression to advanced and metastatic disease (i.e., metformin’s cancer treatment modality, bottom). Our current ability to
identify pre-malignant lesions has the potential to allow their early detection and treatment with metformin as a pro-senescence modality.
In a neoadjuvant setting, metformin-induced senescence may reduce tumor growth and trigger the immune system to clear senescent cells,
contributing to the reduction of tumor burden obtained with traditional chemotherapeutic and radiottherapeutic protocols. Metformin-based
pro-senescence approaches may be also advantageous in the adjuvant setting, as it may have the ability to reduce the statistical risk of
relapse from occult disease (e.g., residual disease in lymph nodes or systemic micrometastasis) that could arise from remaining quiescent
CSCs.

as those with premalignant conditions (e.g., DCIS of the
breast, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia of the lung) or
those with a high risk of disease recurrence (e.g., in the
adjuvant setting) (Fig. 4).
If metformin therapy creates an intrinsic barrier
against tumorigenesis by lowering the threshold for
stress-induced senescence, metformin therapeutic
strategies aimed to enhance senescence may be pivotal for
therapeutic intervention of cancer. To test the hypothesis
that metformin therapy is a senescence-based cancer
prevention strategy (Fig. 4, top), we suggest the following
study in women with DCIS lesions. Given that DCIS
lesions contain pre-existing carcinoma precursor cells, it
would be of interest to evaluate whether metformin use
in nondiabetic women reduces the expected progression
rate (12-15%) of DCIS lesions to invasive breast cancer.
Taking advantage of previously used trial strategies for
tamoxifen-based neoadjuvant therapy of DCIS [196], it
might be reasonable to start a clinical trial for metforminbased neoadjuvant therapy of DCIS in which metformin
is administered after diagnosis by a primary biopsy but
before the commencement of standard-of-cancer surgical
therapy. New contralateral tumors in women with
breast cancer might be useful as a model for secondary
prevention, similar to tamoxifen [197]. If valid, such a
model would facilitate the testing of metformin therapy
as a senescence-based cancer treatment strategy (Fig. 4,
bottom). Taking advantage of previous trials on the antiCSC activity of targeted drugs in a neoadjuvant setting
[198, 199], paired core biopsies could be obtained from
patients before and after treatment with metformin
regimens. Cell populations isolated from biopsy samples
taken before and after metformin-based therapy could
be assayed for tumor-initiating cells by measuring their
ability to form mammospheres in vivo, a widely accepted
indicator of self-renewal. In parallel, the presence of
senescent cells before and after metformin-based therapy
could be detected by the classical test for SA-β-Gal
activity using X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-Dgalactoside) [200]. As suggested by Nardella et al. [157],
this type of analysis may be readily performed on tumor
biopsy samples, although it should be noted that biopsy
samples should be frozen for optimal senescence analysis
[201]. Immunohistochemical analysis of traditional
senescence effectors (e.g., upregulation of p53, INK4A,
p21 and p27) can also enable the detection of metformin’s
ability to induce senescence as part of its therapeutic
effects.
Extensive clinical experience with metformin
coupled with the preclinical rationale, potential
mechanisms of metformin’s anti-cancer effects and its
modest toxicity have sped up the timeline of oncology drug
development (Fig. 1). Indeed, metformin exemplifies how
systems biology strategies for repositioning regulatory
agency (FDA/EMEA)-approved drugs may accelerate
our ability to prevent and/or treat cancer in a multifaceted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

manner, including elimination of CSCs. We anticipate the
translational impact that metformin will have as a valuable
oncology drug due to its ability to arrest carcinomas at
their non-invasive, premalignant stages. Current [107,
193, 202] and future clinical trials will elucidate whether
metformin has the potential to be used in both preventive
and treatment settings as an adjuvant to current cancer
therapeutics.
