Abstract
The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1a drives
expression of many glycolytic enzymes. Here, we show that
hypoxic glycolysis, in turn, increases HIF1a transcriptional activity and stimulates tumor growth, revealing a novel feed-forward
mechanism of glycolysis-HIF1a signaling. Negative regulation of
HIF1a by AMPK1 is bypassed in hypoxic cells, due to ATP
elevation by increased glycolysis, thereby preventing phosphorylation and inactivation of the HIF1a transcriptional coactivator
p300. Notably, of the HIF1a-activated glycolytic enzymes we
evaluated by gene silencing, aldolase A (ALDOA) blockade

produced the most robust decrease in glycolysis, HIF-1 activity,
and cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, either RNAi-mediated
silencing of ALDOA or systemic treatment with a speciﬁc smallmolecule inhibitor of aldolase A was sufﬁcient to increase overall
survival in a xenograft model of metastatic breast cancer. In
establishing a novel glycolysis–HIF-1a feed-forward mechanism
in hypoxic tumor cells, our results also provide a preclinical
rationale to develop aldolase A inhibitors as a generalized strategy
to treat intractable hypoxic cancer cells found widely in most solid
tumors. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4259–69. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

VEGF (5, 6). HIF-1 also upregulates the transcription of several
glycolytic enzymes (7). Both glycolysis and HIF activity are critical
for cancer cell survival, and have been proposed as therapeutic
targets for agents that inhibit tumor growth (8–11).
Although HIF-1 is critical for tumor growth, in part by inducing
glycolytic enzymes, our ﬁndings suggest that glycolysis is necessary for maintaining HIF-1 activity. This constitutes a feed-forward
loop that promotes increased HIF-1 activity and glycolysis, which
we show is mediated by inhibition of the AMPK1/EA1-binding
protein p300 pathway. HIF-1 is often studied in terms of its
protein levels, but we show here that HIF-1 may not be functionally active if glycolysis is limiting. Inhibiting the glycolysis-HIF-1
feed-forward loop, therefore, offers a novel target for blocking
tumor energy and biomass production and the HIF-1 survival
response. Although HIF-1 and glycolysis have previously been
proposed as targets for cancer treatment, efforts to develop inhibitors have been unsuccessful. Here, we used an unbiased approach to identify the glycolytic enzyme, fructose-bisphosphatate
aldolase A (ALDOA) as a key target for inhibiting both glycolysis
and HIF1 activity. By using an inhibitor that targets ALDOA, we
found that inhibition of ALDOA does indeed break the feedforward loop, blocking both glycolysis and HIF-1 activity in cells,
with the prospect of inhibiting tumor growth in vivo.

Glycolysis is deﬁned as the sequence of 10 enzymatic reactions
converting glucose to pyruvate, which is accompanied by release
of energy in the form of ATP. In normal cells, pyruvate then enters
the mitochondrial carboxylic acid cycle in the presence of oxygen,
or is converted to lactic acid in its absence. Glycolysis is critical for
providing rapidly dividing normal and cancer cells with energy
and metabolic intermediates to synthesize cellular biomass (1, 2).
Malignant transformation greatly increases aerobic glycolysis
(the Warburg effect; ref. 3), which favors production of additional
ATP and metabolites for biomass synthesis, and enables uncontrolled proliferation. Solid tumors also have an abnormal vasculature that leads to poor blood perfusion and hypoxia. A cancer
cell's response to hypoxia is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible
transcription factors HIF-1 and 2 (4), which increase the expression of numerous survival factors, including genes that encode

Facility, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Each
cell line was stably transfected with a pGL3 plasmid (Promega)
containing a 5x repeat of the hypoxia transcriptional response
element (HRE) ﬂanking a luciferase reporter and a G418 selection
marker (HRE-luc). The reporter plasmid was a gift of Dr. R. Gillies
(Mofﬁtt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL). Following selection, pools of
stably transfected cells were generated and stored frozen for later
use.
For conditional Aldolase A (ALDOA) knockdown in an in
vivo murine model, four sequences predicted to target ALDOA
gene expression were selected from the Thermo Scientiﬁc
Dharmacon shRNA library and each was inserted in a TRIPZ
lentiviral vector (Open Biosystems). The HRE luciferase MDAMB-231 line described above was transduced with shALDOAexpressing lentivirus, and stable lines were selected in puromycin in 96-well plates with one cell per well to generate clonal
populations. Sequence identiﬁcation for use in both in vitro and
in vivo experiments was determined by relative ALDOA by
Western blot analysis. After puromycin- and G418-resistant
clones were selected, shALDOA expression in cells was induced
using 400 ng/mL doxycycline in both normoxia and hypoxia
(1% O2) and for in vivo tumors by feeding mice chow containing 625 mg/kg doxycycline (Harlan Laboratories) to achieve
ALDOA knockdown.
Cell transfection
Transient siRNA reverse transfections were carried out for
global siRNA screening using X-tremeGene (Roche) according to
the manufacturer's instructions with the genome-wide SmartPool
siRNA library from Dharmacon using the MIA PaCa-2 HRE
luciferase line. After identifying initial glycolysis genetic hits,
follow-up work in each of the three additional cell lines listed
used Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Qiagen) and Dharmacon SMARTpool siRNAs for HIF-1a, Aldolase A, AMPK, p300, PCAF, FIH,
PLK-1 or the On-Target-Plus non-targeting pool #4 (OTP4). Total
siRNA concentration was kept at 40 nmol/L for single or multiple
siRNA combinations. Knockdown efﬁciency was determined by
Western blotting of cell lysates 96 hours posttransfection.
Chemical compounds
Synthesis of naphthalene-2,6-diyl bis(dihydrogen phosphate)
is described in Supplementary Materials and Methods S1.
Western blotting
Primary antibodies for Western blotting were: HIF-1a (BD
Biosciences), Aldolase A (Thermo Scientiﬁc), b-actin, p300, phospho-p300 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and AMPK/
phospho-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology).
Cell viability and HIF-1a activity assays
Viability of cell populations was quantiﬁed photometrically at
475 nm using the XTT Cell Viability Assay (Biotium), according to
the manufacturer's instructions. HIF-1a activity was measured
using a Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Relative Luciferase activity (% control) was calculated to correlate HIF-1 expression with cell viability data for each gene knockdown.
Determination of ATP concentration
Cellular ATP was measured using an ATP Assay Kit (Abcam)
according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantiﬁed 96 hours

4260 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

after siRNA transfection by both colorimetric (OD 570 nm) and
ﬂuorometric (Ex/Em ¼ 535/587 nm) methods.
Measurement of cellular glycolysis
Glycolysis was measured as the rate of extracellular acidiﬁcation (ECAR), using the Seahorse Bioscience XF96e platform (Seahorse Bioscience) and the XF Glycolysis Stress Test Assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. To measure glycolysis under
hypoxia, a modiﬁed hanging drop tissue culture method was used
to evaluate 3-dimensional spheroids of PANC-1 HRE cells transduced with shALDOA constructs. Three days after seeding cells
and 24 hours before measuring glycolysis spheroid shALDOA
expression was induced with 400 ng/mL doxycycline. A ﬁnal
volume of 175 mL of pre-conditioned assay medium containing
18 spheroids was added to each well of a test plate and incubated
at 37 C in a CO2-free incubator until the experiment was initiated.
Spheroids exhibited a hypoxic core based on analysis with a
ﬂuorescent hypoxia probe LOX-1 (SCIVAX USA, Inc.) without
the need for hypoxic gassing conditions.
ALDOA kinetic assays
ALDOA kinetic assays are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods S2.
Crystallization and structure solution
Protein crystallization and structure solution are described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods S3, and data collection
and reﬁnement statistics in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.
Xenografts
Approximately 107 MDA-MB-231 HRE cells, MDA-MB-231
cells harboring shALDOA clones 8.8 and 9.7, and MDA-MB231 HRE empty vector cells, all in log cell growth, were suspended
each in 0.2 mL PBS and injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pads of female NOD-SCID mice. Groups contained ﬁve
mice. When the tumors reached 250 mm3, chow containing
doxycycline was substituted for control feed (Harlan Laboratories) in test groups. Mice were euthanized when they became
clinically moribund, associated with the metastatic spread of the
MDA-MB-231 tumor to liver and lung (12). Animal studies were
approved by SBPMRI's Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean  SD unless indicated otherwise. The
Student t test assuming two-tailed distributions was used to
calculate statistical signiﬁcance between groups. Animal survival
was determined by the Kaplan–Meier analysis with P < 0.05
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Glycolytic enzymes regulate HIF-1a activity
To identify genes that regulate HIF activity, we conducted a
genome-wide siRNA screen using MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer
cells with a stably integrated 5 x HRE/promoter-luciferase (luc)
HIF reporter to identify genes that when knocked down inhibited
HIF activity under hypoxic conditions (1% O2). It should be
noted that the reporter cannot distinguish between HIF-1 and
HIF-2 activity, although hypoxic MIA PaCa-2 cells express predominantly HIF-1, and HIF-2 has been reported not to upregulate
glycolysis genes (5). Unexpectedly, the screen identiﬁed several

Changes in glycolytic enzyme expression alters HIF-1 activity. Thirty genes encoding glycolytic enzyme isoforms were selected for validation from a genome-wide
siRNA screen for inhibitors of cellular HIF-1 activity. A, HIF-1 activity was measured using MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells harboring a constitutively
expressed HRE-luciferase reporter 72 hours after siRNA reverse transfection and after 24 hours hypoxia (1% oxygen). siRNAs were from a different manufacturer than
in the original screen. Values were normalized to MIA PaCa-2 cell viability under the same conditions as determined using a XTT viability assay and results
expressed as a percentage of nontreated cells. Closed bars, cell viability; open bars, HRE-luciferase (HIF-1) activity. Bars represent SD of three determinations.

glycolysis-related genes whose knockdown inhibited HIF-1 activity (Supplementary Table S3). The expression of glycolysis genes
has been reported to be increased by HIF-1 during hypoxia (5, 13).
We conﬁrmed this using RNAseq in MIA PaCa-2 cells, and found
that 16 glycolysis genes were upregulated in hypoxia, 15 of which
showed HIF-1 dependence (Supplementary Table S4).
To test the possibility that a glycolysis–HIF-1 feed-forward loop
existed, we used a panel of siRNAs to knockdown 30 glycolysis
genes and their isoforms (including pyruvate dehydrogenase,
which is responsible for linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle
in the mitochondria), and then measured HRE-luciferase activity
(a surrogate of HIF-1 activity) and cell proliferation. Using the
same MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells stably transfected with
the HRE-luc reporter, we found compelling evidence that glycolytic enzyme activity is indeed critical for the normal functionality
of HIF-1 (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained using HRE-luc
PANC-1 pancreatic, MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast, and HT-29
colon cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary
Table S5). The greatest decrease in HRE-luc activity in all lines,
normalized to cell number, was observed when ALDOA was
knocked down. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in the
786-O renal adenocarcinoma cell line that expresses HIF-2 exclusively, suggesting that regulation of HIF activity by glycolytic
enzymes is not limited to HIF-1 (Fig. 1B). Dual knockdown of
PGK1 and PGK2 suggested they have additive activities on HREluc inhibition, although this was not accompanied by an additive

Knockdown of ALDOA, or PGK1 or PGK2 in combination inhibited glycolysis in all cell lines (Fig. 2A and B), which was accompanied by lower cellular ATP levels (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S3).
HIF-1a activity is mediated by AMPK activation and p300
inactivation
We ﬁrst established that, in all tumor cells tested, decreased
HIF-1 activity caused by ALDOA or PGK1 or 2 knockdown
occurred without changes in HIF-1 protein levels, and was similar
in normoxia or hypoxia, although a greater overall effect was seen
in hypoxia, where HIF-1 levels are elevated (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4). In hypoxia, the hydroxylation of key HIF-1
proline residues by oxygen-sensitive dioxygenases is inhibited,
thus preventing HIF-1 binding to the von Hippel-Lindau protein
(pVHL), which normally leads to ubiquitination of HIF-1 and its
proteasomal degradation (4). To evaluate the possible mechanisms underlying this change in HIF-1 activity, we co-transfected
glycolysis-related siRNAs together with siRNAs targeting genes
that are known to regulate HIF-1 activity. These included AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK; refs. 14, 15); E1A-associated
cellular p300 transcriptional coactivator (p300; refs. 16, 17);
PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor; refs. 18, 19); and FIH (factor
inhibiting HIF-1), which interacts with HIF-1a and VHL to repress
HIF-1 transcriptional activity (20, 21). We found that AMPK

knockdown rescued HIF-1 inhibition caused by ALDOA or PGK2
knockdown, but observed little effect when either p300 or PCAF
was knocked down (Fig. 3B). FIH knockdown also negated the
effects of ALDOA and PGK1 knockdown on HIF-1 activity, likely
due to loss of negative regulation of HIF-1. Western blotting
showed that ALDOA knockdown signiﬁcantly increased phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172, a marker of AMPK activation in
response to cellular stress such as ATP depletion (22, 23), in both
normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 4A). Further evidence that AMPK
mediates the effects of ALDOA (or PGK1 or PGK2) knockdown on
HIF-1 activity was the rescue of HIF-1 activity by the AMPK
inhibitor, dorsomorphin (Fig. 4B). AMPK activation can lead to
phosphorylation of p300 at Ser89 that attenuates the interaction
of p300 with a variety of transcription factors in vitro and in vivo,
including HIF-1 (24). We observed that knockdown of ALDOA or
PGK2, although not PGK1, resulted in p300 Ser89 phosphorylation in HT-29 and MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4A). Taken together, the

suggested mechanism of glycolytic
control of cellular HIF-1a activity
through AMPK/p300 signaling. In
normoxic conditions, cancer cell
aerobic glycolysis maintains the cellular
ATP/ADP ratio at levels sufﬁcient to
prevent phosphorylation of AMPK, thus
allowing the unrestricted formation of a
p300/HIF-1 complex that activates HIF1. When cellular ATP formation is
decreased under hypoxic conditions, a
decreased ratio of ATP/ADP leads to
phosphorylation of AMPK, which in turn
phosphorylates p300, preventing its
association with HIF-1, thus leading to
decreased HIF-1 activity. Because this
leads to decreased synthesis of
glycolytic enzymes, a feed-forward
inhibition loop of decreased glycolysis/
decreased HIF-1 activity is established
despite elevated HIF-1 protein levels
due to HIF-1 stabilization under hypoxic
conditions.

results suggest that inhibition of HIF-1 activity and a concomitant
decrease in glycolysis are mediated by AMPK activation (possibly
in response to low cellular ATP levels), which in turn promotes
p300 phosphorylation, preventing p300 from coactivating HIF-1
transcriptional activity (Fig. 4C).
Variable expression of aldolase isoforms suggest compensatory
effects on glycolysis
To further understand the basis for variability in the effects of
ALDOA knockdown on proliferation among the 4 HRE luciferase
lines, we next tested for possible compensatory mechanisms when
ALDOA is eliminated, by immunoblotting to analyze expression
of aldolase B and C isoforms in normoxia and hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Interestingly, we found that HT-29
cells (a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line with epithelial
morphology), which were the only cells found to be recalcitrant to
ALDOA knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S1), were also the only

Targeting a Glycolysis HIF-1 Feed-Forward Loop

glycolysis and HIF-1 inhibition, promoted longer median survival time than did the partial knockdown clone 9.7. Postmortem analysis of mice indicated marked tumor metastasis to the
lung and liver. Although knockdown of ALDOA extended
lifespan, doxycycline given either as pretreatment or when
tumors were established had a similar effect. This suggests that
ALDOA knockdown does not affect tumor implantation; rather,
that ALDOA knockdown inhibits metastasis from the primary
tumor to the lungs and liver, which occurs late in the tumor
development process, and is the most likely cause of death.
Identiﬁcation and characterization of a small-molecule
allosteric inhibitor of ALDOA, TDZD-8
To conﬁrm that ALDOA is a target with potential for cancer
therapy, we sought a small-molecule probe inhibitor of human
ALDOA. We carried out a chemical library screen for inhibitors
of ALDOA using a novel biochemical assay, which allowed us
to identify small-molecule inhibitors that would have interfered with the classic ALDOA assay. We identiﬁed the compound TDZD-8 as an inhibitor with time-dependent inhibition
(Fig. 6A and B). To determine the mechanism of inhibition, we
ﬁrst determined the crystal structure of native human ALDOA at
a resolution of 2.4 Å (see Supplementary Materials and Methods S3 and Supplementary Table S1). In the native crystals, the
C-terminal tail ("C-tail"; residues 345–363) lies across the
active site, with the C-terminal Tyr363 inserted into the active
site (Supplementary Fig. S7B). There is abundant evidence that
the C-tail is highly mobile and that its conformation and
dynamics are critical for catalysis (25). Indeed, we observed
a 10-fold reduction in kcat in an ALDOA construct truncated
before the C-tail (not shown). We next soaked a preformed
native crystal in a solution containing 1 mmol/L TDZD-8, and
determined its structure at 2.65 Å resolution (Supplementary
Table S1). We found unambiguous evidence for TDZD-8 binding covalently to a single site, Cys239, which lies on an exposed
loop distal to the catalytic site (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
Computational docking studies support our observation that
the thiadiazole ring of TDZD-8 can bind to the sulfhydryl group
of Cys239 without the need for signiﬁcant conformational
changes in the protein.
In the crystalline form, however, lattice contacts reduce the
mobility of the protein, which may obscure ligand-binding sites
that are available in solution. This may be especially true for

ALDOA, given the known mobility of the C-tail. In the course of
our studies, we had cocrystallized ALDOA bound to the active site
substrate-mimetic, ND1, and solved its structure at 2.2 Å resolution (Supplementary Table S2). The binding of ND1 sterically
occludes the C-terminal tyrosine, causing the entire C-tail to be
ejected from its groove and become disordered, a phenomenon
that is typical of this class of inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
We therefore proceeded to soak preformed ALDOA-ND1 crystals
with TDZD-8, and solved its crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution
(Supplementary Table S2). In this case, we observed strong ligand
binding at C239 (as before) as well as at a second site, C289, which
is also distal to the active site but proximal to the C-tail (Fig. 6C–E
and Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D). C289 is partly buried in
the native structure, and the binding of TDZD-8 to C289 induces
local conformational changes in loops that would contact the Ctail in native crystals.
Our data suggest that the reactivity of Cys239 toward TDZD8 is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the absence or presence of
the C-tail; by contrast, the reactivity of Cys289 is strongly
inﬂuenced, because binding is only observed when the C-tail
has been removed. It should therefore follow that ligand
binding to C289 in solution should perturb the conformation
of the C-tail, and thereby modulate catalytic activity. Indeed, in
solution, we observed a near-doubling of the half-life of inactivation by TDZD-8 (from 120 to 214 min) when Cys289 was
mutated to Ala (Fig. 6B). Thus, TDZD-8 appears to act as an
allosteric inhibitor, via modulation of the structure and/or
dynamics of the C-tail, mediated principally through modiﬁcation of Cys289, a residue that lies within a well-deﬁned,
three-dimensional pocket.
TZDZ-8 inhibits glycolysis, HIF-1 activity, and cancer cell
proliferation
TDZD-8 treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells inhibited glycolysis and HIF-1 activity as well as cancer cell proliferation
in a dose-dependent manner at low mmol/L concentrations (Fig.
6F and Supplementary Fig. S8), and also decreased cellular [ATP]
while increasing phospho-AMPK (Fig. 6G and Supplementary Fig.
S9). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with TDZD-8 under hypoxic
conditions (1% O2) for 6 hours resulted in an approximately 2fold reduction of dihydroxy acetone phosphate (DHAP), the
product of the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate substrate
by ALDOA, and pyruvate, whereas levels of the lower-abundance

intermediates 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate
were not affected (Supplementary Fig. S10).
We therefore used TDZD-8 as a pharmacologic probe to see
whether we could show an antitumor effect. When administered
intraperitoneally daily for 20 days at a dose of 12 mg/kg per day to
mice with MDA-MB-231 orthotopic breast cancer tumors, TDZD8 caused signiﬁcant slowing of tumor growth, by about 60% by
day 32 (Fig. 6H). Pharmacodynamic studies after a single dose of
TDZD-8 showed an approximately 50% decrease in tumor lactate
levels within 4 h, a 40% decrease in DHAP, and a slower decrease
with daily dosing for 5 days in downstream phosphoglycerate
(Fig. 6I). Thus, TDZD-8 itself at low levels, or an active metabolite
appears to reach the tumor in sufﬁcient amounts to inhibit tumor
glycolysis, associated with antitumor activity.

Discussion
We have shown that HIF-1–induced upregulation of glycolytic genes during anaerobic (hypoxic) glycolysis in cancer cells
is itself stimulated by the product of glycolysis, ATP, thereby
completing a glycolysis HIF-1 feed-forward loop that stimulates
tumor growth. When anaerobic glycolysis is inhibited (e.g., via
inhibition of ALDOA), ATP levels are reduced, and the feedforward loop is broken via activation of the AMP-activated
protein kinase-1 (AMPK1), which is sensitive to the ratio of
AMP/ATP in the cell (22, 23). Activated AMPK1 inhibits the
transcriptional activity of HIF-1 by phosphorylating its transcriptional coactivator, the E1A-associated, cellular p300
(p300), at Ser 89, which blocks formation of the p300–HIF1 coactivation complex.
HIF-1 is critical for cancer cell survival and tumor growth in the
stressed hypoxic tumor environment (4, 5). However, HIF-1
inhibitors used as single agents for the treatment of human cancer
have not advanced in the clinic. Thus, we took an unbiased
approach, using a high-throughput siRNA synthetic lethal screen,
initially to identify genes that might be targets to inhibit tumor
growth, which could also be used in combination with HIF-1
inhibition. Unexpectedly, several hits in the screen were glycolytic
enzymes. Although it was known that HIF-1 increases glycolytic
activity in tumors by inducing expression of glycolytic enzymes
(5, 7, 26), it had not previously been reported that glycolysis
increases HIF-1 activity. We found that the knockdown of 16 of 30
glycolytic enzymes and isoforms were associated with detectable
inhibition of HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Among them, ALDOA
and PGK1/2 knockdown resulted in robust inhibition of HIF-1
activity in all lines tested. Importantly, inhibitors that target these
proteins should have the ability to block two processes critical for
tumor growth: glycolysis, the source of energy and metabolic
support (this could be tumor or stroma glycolysis); and HIF-1,
which promotes cancer cell survival and tumor growth through
increased angiogenesis.
We chose ALDOA as a proof-of-principle target for inhibitor
development, in part because its knockdown in cancer cells was
associated with greater inhibition of cancer cell proliferation than
PGK1/2 knockdown. This could be because ALDOA has other
roles, including "moonlighting" as a nuclear protein (27), or that
ALDOA is more important as a driver of glycolysis, whereas PGK1/
2 is a driver of tumor angiogenesis, which would not be apparent
from our cell-based studies. ALDOA expression has been reported
to be signiﬁcantly elevated relative to other glycolytic enzymes in a
number of human tumor types (28, 29). Another consideration is

4268 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

that ALDOA is the major ALDO isoform driving glycolysis in
cancer cells, sometimes aided by ALDOC, whereas PGK1 and
PGK2 appear to have redundant activities.
To demonstrate the potential of small-molecule ALDOA
inhibitors for cancer therapy, we turned to a probe inhibitor
of human ALDOA that we discovered through a chemical
library screen, using a novel biochemical assay. The compound,
TDZD-8, a 1,2,4-thiadiazole, showed time-dependent inhibition of ALDOA that suggested a covalent interaction with the
protein. Our crystallographic studies showed that TDZD-8
bound to 2 Cys residues (Cys289 and Cys239) on the surface
of each ALDOA monomer. Although both residues lie distal to
the active site, one of them Cys289, lies in a well-deﬁned
pocket, and we found its reactivity toward TDZD-8 to be
strongly inﬂuenced by the presence or absence of the C-tail.
Thus, we propose that TDZD-8 binding to Cys289 in solution
should allosterically perturb the conformation or ﬂexibility of
the C-tail, thereby inhibiting catalytic activity. The electron
density derived by crystallography is consistent with disulﬁde
bond formation and ring-opening of TDZD-8. Studies using
Cys-directed reagents to inhibit ALDO Cys residues have previously suggested that they are involved in enzyme activity
(30). Of ALDO's 8 Cys residues, only 4 are accessible in the
absence of denaturing agents, and these include Cys-289 and
Cys239. TDZ8-8 has allowed us, for the ﬁrst time, to demonstrate crystallographically an allosteric interaction between
ALDOA Cys289 and the catalytic site. Most importantly,
although TDZD-8 is a simple chemical probe without optimized drug-like properties, it has nonetheless allowed us to
demonstrate an association between inhibition of glycolysis,
HIF-1 activity and the proliferation of cancer cell lines at low
mmol/L concentrations. The compound also exhibited in vivo
antitumor against MDA-MB-231 xenografts in mice and was
associated with decreased levels of the glycolytic products of
ALDOA activity in tumors.
In summary, we have shown that a feed-forward loop in
tumors, simultaneously promoting increased HIF-1 activity and
increased glycolysis, offers a target, ALDOA, with which to block
tumor energy/metabolite production pathways and the HIF-1a
survival response. Our HIF-1 activity-oriented RNAi screen and
subsequent mechanism-based analysis expand our understanding of known and novel regulators of the HIF-1 transcription
factor, and point to a previously uncharacterized regulation of
HIF-1 activity by increased glycolytic enzyme activity.
