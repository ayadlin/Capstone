BACKGROUND: Optimal management of children with centrally located low-grade glioma (LGG) is unclear. Initial interventions in
most children are chemotherapy in younger and radiation therapy (RT) in older children. A better understanding of the inherent risk
factors along with the effects of interventions on long-term outcome can lead to reassessment of the current approaches to minimize
long-term morbidity. METHODS: To reassess the current treatment strategies of centrally located LGG, we compared the long-term
survival and morbidity of different treatment regimens. Medical records of patients primarily treated at Texas Children’s Cancer and
Hematology Centers between 1987 and 2008 were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with a median follow-up of 79 months
were included in the analysis. The 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients were 96% and 53%,
respectively. The 5-year PFS for those treated initially with RT (12 patients; median age, 11 years [range, 3-15 years]) and with chemotherapy (28 patients; median age, 2 years [range 0-8 years]) were 76% and 37%, respectively (log-rank test P 5.02). Among children
who progressed after chemotherapy, the 5-year PFS after salvage RT was 55%. Patients diagnosed at a younger age (<5 years) were
more likely to experience endocrine abnormalities (Fisher exact test; P<.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Effective and durable tumor control
was obtained with RT as initial treatment. In younger patients, chemotherapy can delay the use of RT; however, frequent progression
and long-term morbidity are common. More effective and less toxic therapies are required in these patients, the majority of whom

INTRODUCTION
Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and other forms of low-grade glioma (LGG) are the most common central nervous system neoplasms in children. Gross total resection of tumors amenable to surgical resection is generally curative.1 However, in children with progressive or symptomatic tumors involving optic chiasm and diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus),
aggressive surgical resection is generally not feasible. In these patients either radiation therapy (RT) or chemotherapy are
widely accepted initial interventions.2 Historically, focal RT with standard doses of 45 to 54 Gy has been shown to be
effective in the long-term control of the tumors. However, due to growing concern of adverse effects of radiotherapy in
very young children, chemotherapy has been widely used as first-line treatment since the 1990s to stabilize the tumors and
delay the use of RT in an attempt to reduce long-term morbidity.3-6 The long-term morbidity of children who are exposed
to 1 or several regimens of chemotherapy before eventually receiving RT has not been clearly described. Although RT generally provides better tumor control than chemotherapy, optimal timing remains controversial.
Recently, a novel tandem duplication at 7q34 leading to fusion between BRAF and KIAA1549 genes was identified
in the PA genome as a frequent event (66%-71%)7,8. Resulting BRAF-KIAA1549 (B-K) fusion protein has constitutive
BRAF kinase activity, which then activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This genetic event is
suggested to be a potential tumor-initiating event.9,10 Hawkins et al. demonstrated that B-K fusion gene was a favorable
prognostic factor in incompletely resected pediatric LGG.11 Others could not confirm this, however.

Centrally Located Low-Grade Glioma in Children/Terashima et al

We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric
patients with centrally located LGG who were treated at
Texas Children’s Cancer Center (TCCC), Baylor College
of Medicine, in order to evaluate the long-term survival
and morbidity associated with treatment. Our goal was to
reassess the current treatment strategies to gain a better
understanding of the benefits and risks of different treatment approaches. A secondary goal was to determine
whether BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion is associated with a better progression-free survival (PFS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The clinical database of TCCC and the Department of
Neurosurgery at Texas Children’s Hospital were searched
using various keywords, including low-grade glioma, lowgrade astrocytoma, optic glioma, PA, diffuse astrocytoma,
and astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified). Of 251
patients who were diagnosed between 1987 and 2008, 204
were excluded, mostly due to noncentral location, highgrade histology, neurofibromatosis, and inadequate information. Forty-seven patients with centrally located tumors
(thalamic, hypothalamic/chiasmatic, and other deep midline structures) who were followed for at least 36 months
were selected for further analysis. Patients were excluded if
they had a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 or isolated optic nerve, were seen only once in consultation, or
were admitted for surgery only. We decided to exclude
children with neurofibromatosis type 1 because they tend
to have a more indolent course, rarely receive RT and the
tumors tend to be usually biologically less active after the
age of 6 years. The histopathology specimens were available for review in 34 patients. Archived slides were
reviewed by 2 pediatric neuropathologists (A. A. and B.
E.) according to the World Health Organization 2007 criteria. The study was approved by the institutional review
board at TCCC, Baylor College of Medicine.
Neurocognitive

All available neurology and ophthalmology consultation
records were reviewed. All reports of detailed standardized
neurocognitive evaluation—including WISC-III or -IV
and complete assessment of adaptive skills performed by
neuropsychologists at Texas Children’s Learning Support
Center—were reviewed. Neurologic abnormality was
defined as static abnormal function following diagnosis
and/or treatment. Visual abnormality was defined as a
decrease in visual acuity or visual fields from the time of
diagnosis. Cognitive abnormality was defined as impairment of either domain of cognitive assessment battery to less

than the 2nd percentile. Behavioral abnormality was considered present when impaired adaptive behavior was documented by clinical psychologists or pediatric psychiatrists.
Endocrinology

Endocrine laboratory testing results and endocrinology
consultation records were reviewed. The following domains
were assessed: thyroid function, linear growth, precocious
puberty, delayed puberty, diabetes inspidus, and adrenal
function. Each domain was defined abnormal when
chronic medical intervention was required by endocrinologists, such as hormone supplementation or suppression.
Radiology

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain
were reviewed by 1 pediatric neuroradiologist (J. J.). The
volume of the tumors was compared between 2 MRI studies in each patient who received initial chemotherapy at
diagnosis and before salvage radiation treatment. Volumetric calculation was based on measuring maximum
dimension of tumor in 3 planes and using the volume
formula for an ellipsoid, L*W*H/2. The measurements
were performed at a PACS review workstation using T2weighted or FLAIR images in 2 planes, or T1-weighted
images when unavailable. Peripheral tumor cysts were
excluded from measurement.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization for
BRAF-KIAA1544 Fusion/Duplication

Three-color interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis was performed using a centromeric
(CEP7, Vysis; SpectrumAqua) reference probe and 2 custom-made locus specific probes on 7q34: RP11-837G3
(covering the centromeric end of BRAF up to exon 9;
SpectrumOrange) and RP11-92N1 (covering telomeric
end of KIAA1549 up to exon 16; SpectrumGreen). Metaphase FISH was performed to verify correct mapping of
probes. Protocol was performed as reported elsewhere.12
Signals were scored in at least 100 non-overlapping, intact
nuclei. Nonneoplastic specimens were used as a control.
Ploidy of chromosome 7 was evaluated by counting the
number of aqua signals per nuclei. The B-K fusion/duplication was considered present in cases with at least 10% of
nuclei showing pairs of closely spaced signals (“doublets”)
for both orange and green probes (indicating duplication),
as well as overlap of 1 signal from each “doublet” resulting
in 1 yellow signal (indicating fusion).
Statistical Analyses

Descriptive statistics were performed using mean, median, SDs, or proportions as appropriate. Overall survival

(OS) and PFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences between subgroups were assessed
via log-rank test. Survival times for OS and PFS were
defined as the time from diagnosis to death and to first
relapse, respectively. P<.05 was considered statistically
significant. Univariate and multivariable analyses were
performed using Cox regression. The chi-square test or
Fisher exact test was used to determine the association
between clinical/interventional characteristics and longterm effects. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2
(SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics

Table 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics of the study
population. The median age at diagnosis was 4 years
(range, 0-16 years). The majority (70%) of the patients
presented with chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumor. Fortyfive patients (96%) had initial surgery (mostly biopsy),
and diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Two
patients (4%) did not undergo any surgical procedure and
diagnosis was made based on characteristic MRI imaging
of optic pathway glioma. The most common histopathologic diagnosis at diagnosis was PA (85%).
Treatment

Seven patients (median age, 8 years [range, 1-16 years])
underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Gross total
resection was achieved in 1 patient. Four patients had near
total resection, and 2 patients had subtotal resection.
Twelve patients (median age 11 years, range 3-15) underwent focal RT as initial therapy. Eleven received focal
photon therapy at a total dose of 50.4 Gy either by
2632

3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated RT.
One patient underwent proton beam RT. The remaining
28 patients (median age, 2 years [range, 0-8 years])
received chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Most
patients (21/28) received a combination of carboplatin
and vincristine. Other regimens included the combination of carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide
(ACNS0223, 4 patients); carboplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide (POG9436, 2 patients); and carboplatin
and etoposide (1 patient) (Figure 1).
Age at diagnosis was significantly associated with
choice of the initial treatment. A higher proportion of
younger patients received chemotherapy as initial treatment (21/25 patients; age, 0-4 years), whereas a greater
proportion of older patients received up-front radiotherapy (10/22 patients; age, 5years).
Overall, 25 patients experienced recurrence or progression of their tumors. Two patients who developed
recurrences after surgical resection received RT. Of the
4 patients who relapsed after initial RT, 2 underwent surgical resection of the tumor, 1 patient received chemotherapy, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Among the
19 patients who had a progression after initial chemotherapy, 14 underwent RT, and 5 patients received another
chemotherapy regimen (Figure 1).
FISH Analysis for BRAF-KIAA1549 Fusion/
Duplication

FISH for B-K fusion was performed on the 31 cases where
archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material was
available. Four cases were excluded due to poor quality of
the sample (absent FISH signal). Of the remaining 27
cases, which were all consistent with PA morphologically,
18 (67%) showed B-K fusion/duplication (Figure 2).
OS and PFS

During the observation period of all patients (median, 79
months [range, 36-274 months]), 2 patients died of progressive tumor 36 and 37 months after diagnosis, respectively. Twenty-five patients experienced at least 1 relapse,
and 8 of these experienced multiple relapses. The median
time to initial progression was 95 months (range, 2-234
months). Five-year OS was 96% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 83%-99%) and 5-year PFS was 53% (95% CI,
38%-66%) (Figure 3A and 3B).
When survival was compared between treatment
groups, the 5-year PFS for surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy groups were 71% (95% CI, 26%-92%), 74%
(95% CI, 39%-91%), and 39% (95% CI, 22%-57%),

respectively (P 5 .06 for overall comparison; P 5 .04 for
radiation vs chemotherapy). (Figure 4A).
Univariate analysis for PFS (Table 2) showed that
younger age (0-4 years) was associated with a significantly
higher risk of progression (hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI,
1.07-6.26; P 5 .03) compared with age 5 years (Figure
4B). In 27 patients with qualified tissue sample, risk of
progression was nearly 3 times higher with presence of
B-K fusion/duplication compared with the absence of
B-K fusion/duplication (hazard ratio, 2.95; 95% CI,
0.83-10.51) (Figure 4C). Multivariable analysis including
age, sex, location, treatment, and histology in all 47
patients showed that none of these factors was an independent predictor of PFS. The presence of B-K fusion/
duplication was not an independent prognostic factor
after adjusting for other factors (data not shown).
There was no significant difference in the 5-year OS
between treatment, age, or molecular subgroups.
Salvage Radiation Therapy

Fourteen patients underwent RT after relapse from initial
chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 52.5 months
(range, 11-130 months), 5 patients experienced a second
progression with a 5-year PFS after salvage RT of 55%
(Figure 5A). The median age at diagnosis of these patients
was 1.25 years (range, 0-5 years) and the median age at
salvage RT was 4 years (range, 0-10 years). The median
Cancer

duration between initial diagnosis and salvage RT was
29.5 months (range, 2-108 months). Evaluable MRI
images at both diagnosis and recurrence were available in
9/14 patients who had initial chemotherapy and salvage
RT. In 8/9 patients, their tumors showed no significant
increase in size at the time of salvage RT when compared
with the initial measurement (Figure 5B).
Neurocognitive and Endocrine Outcomes

Neurocognitive and endocrine evaluation results were
available in the majority of the patients. Table 3 summarized the result of 10 domains.
Cognitive assessment was performed in 25 patients,
and 15 (65%) showed an abnormal result. Visual abnormality was the most frequent abnormality, including poor visual
acuity and decreased visual fields. Endocrine abnormality
was strikingly common in patients who were diagnosed at a
younger age. Among 19 patients who were diagnosed before
5 years of age (median follow-up, 128 months [range, 36274 months]), 17 (89%) had at least 1 endocrine abnormality, while only 2/10 patients, for whom the evaluations are
available, who were diagnosed after 5 years of age (median
follow-up, 75.5 months [range, 42-140 months]) had an
endocrine abnormality at the time of assessment (Fisher
exact test; P<.00001). Hypothyroidism (42%), growth
hormone deficiency (38%), and precocious puberty (35%)
were common in younger patients.

DISCUSSION
OS of children with LGG is excellent regardless of patient
demographics, tumor location, histopathologic subtype,
or initial treatment. However, frequent recurrence and
associated sequelae are particularly concerning in these
patients with centrally located tumors where total excision
cannot be performed without significant morbidity. The
OS and PFS of our cohort are consistent with previous
reports.13-18 Although prognostic factors in these reports
are not clearly defined, younger age has been consistently
found as a poor prognostic factor of PFS.13-17 Since current practice for centrally located LGG is to avoid or delay
radiation in younger patients, most of our patients were
initially treated with chemotherapy.1,17 Therefore, age
and treatment are significant confounding factors.

Statistically significant.

A German study, HIT-LGG 1996, treated 123 patients
with chiasmatic-hypothalamic glioma and confirmed that
younger age is an independent poor prognostic factor.16
The histology was mostly PA, and therefore the significance of histology in predicting outcome in these centrally
located tumors is minimal.14 Although pilomyxoid astrocytoma in very young patients can be associated with a
worse PFS, it usually constitutes a small percentage of
patients (only 1 in the present study).
Our cohort confirmed the previous report of frequent B-K fusion in PA, but did not find any significant
association between this fusion and clinical outcomes.
Nevertheless, the diagnostic and prognostic value of B-K
fusion and other MAPK pathway-activating genetic
events should be assessed in a large prospective study
because of a previous report correlating this pathway with
outcome.11,19
2636

RT is considered the definitive treatment for centrally located LGG.1 Our study clearly shows that when
RT is the initial treatment modality, tumor control and
PFS (5-year progression-free survival, 71%) are superior
to chemotherapy (5-year progression-free survival, 39%).
RT was also effective in salvaging the majority of patients
who failed chemotherapy. Delays in the use of RT following initial chemotherapy did not appear to render the
tumors less sensitive to RT.
The true benefit of postponing the need for RT by
initiating chemotherapy is unclear due to the lack of controlled studies comparing different strategies.1,20,21 There
is a concern that by delaying the use of RT, which is considered the definitive therapy, the tumor volume and
hence the RT-treated volume will be larger when the salvage RT is finally initiated. Our results, while in a small
number of patients, showed that there was no difference
in the volume of the tumor when salvage RT was initiated
compared with the volume at the time of initial diagnosis.
This may be due to tumor volume stability with chemotherapy but with clinical progression requiring RT or initial response to chemotherapy followed by progression to
the original volume when salvage RT was initiated.
Another concern, especially in view of the excellent
survival in these patients, is the long-term effects of the tumor and therapies.21-30 The long-term health outcome
study of 240 5-year LGG survivors, including 97 diencephalon tumors, identified an increase in the incidence of
chronic medical conditions beyond the 5-year time point
and significant risk for cognitive decline.24 Diencephalic
location was an independent risk factor for blindness and

poly-endocrinopathy. Other risk factors included RT for
abnormal hearing and poly-endocrinopathy, and younger
age for lower IQ.21,23,24 The current study also showed a
strikingly high incidence of neurocognitive abnormalities
and endocrinopathies associated with younger age. Progressive endocrinopathies could be late manifestations of
the effects of the tumor and the effects of therapies.19
Very high incidence of visual abnormality is mainly due
to direct damage of optic pathway by tumor. However,
the contributing effects of therapies such as radiation or
surgery cannot be ruled out.26 Efforts to avoid or delay
RT in younger patients still resulted in cognitive abnormalities and a poorer PFS. The above findings suggest
that delaying the use of RT in very young children does
not subsequently prevent progressive endocrine and neurocognitive deficits. In this study, the median age at which
patients received RT as salvage therapy was 4 years (range,
0-10 years), suggesting that even when RT is delayed
with the initial use of chemotherapy in very young children, they are still vulnerable to the long-term effects of
RT.
The affected children and families are burdened
with frequent visits to the hospital, sometimes for several
years to receive 1 or more regimens of chemotherapy and
the majority of these children eventually do receive RT,
some well before 10 years of age, an arbitrary threshold for
initiating RT. Recently, advances in RT such as intensitymodulated RT and proton therapy enable more precise
delivery of radiation, potentially minimizing the exposure
of normal brain tissue to radiation.21,29,32 It remains a
challenge to identify a subset of patients based on age,
location, and size of tumor who may benefit from RT as
the initial treatment modality both for control of the tumor and amelioration of long-term effects of therapy.
The management of centrally located LGG must
be carefully planned considering the benefits and short
and long-term risks associated with each treatment
modality. Natural history of tumor stabilization and
occasional regression should be also taken into consideration in long-term management.33 Molecular targeting therapeutics for B-K fusion specifically or MAPK
pathway are promising future treatment with potentially less toxic effect, which are currently in clinical
trials.34 Regardless of management strategy, however,
the importance of long-term surveillance and timely
intervention for the endocrine and neurocognitive late
effects cannot be overemphasized.
