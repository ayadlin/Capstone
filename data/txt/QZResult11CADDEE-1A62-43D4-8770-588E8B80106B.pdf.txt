ABSTRACT
MUC16 (CA125) is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that is up-regulated in
multiple cancers including pancreatic cancer (PC). However, the existence and role
of carboxyl-terminal MUC16 generated following its cleavage in PC is unknown. Our
previous study using a systematic dual-epitope tagged domain deletion approach
of carboxyl-terminal MUC16 has demonstrated the generation of a 17-kDa cleaved
MUC16 (MUC16-Cter). Here, we demonstrate the functional significance of MUC16Cter in PC using the dual-epitope tagged version (N-terminal FLAG- and C-terminal
HA-tag) of 114 carboxyl-terminal residues of MUC16 (F114HA). In vitro analyses using
F114HA transfected MiaPaCa-2 and T3M4 cells showed enhanced proliferation, motility
and increased accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase with apoptosis resistance, a
feature associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). This was supported by enrichment
of ALDH+ CSCs along with enhanced drug-resistance. Mechanistically, we demonstrate
a novel function of MUC16-Cter that promotes nuclear translocation of JAK2 resulting
in phosphorylation of Histone-3 up-regulating stemness-specific genes LMO2 and
NANOG. Jak2 dependence was demonstrated using Jak2+/+ and Jak2–/– cells. Using
eGFP-Luciferase labeled cells, we demonstrate enhanced tumorigenic and metastatic
potential of MUC16-Cter in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrate that MUC16-Cter
mediated enrichment of CSCs is partly responsible for tumorigenic, metastatic and
drug-resistant properties of PC cells.

INTRODUCTION

using lineage tracing in genetically engineered mouse
models and mathematical modeling using patient datasets
have proposed early dissemination of PC cells to establish
the metastatic disease [2,3]. These early-disseminated
cells called circulatory pancreatic cells (CPCs) are of
mesenchymal type and possess the characteristics of
cancer stem cells (CSCs) [2]. A number of recent studies
have demonstrated the significance of CSC in metastasis,

Pancreatic cancer (PC) confers a near 100%
mortality, a dismal 5-year survival rate of 5% and a median
survival of 5-8 months [1]. The bleak prognosis associated
with PC is primarily due to the advanced (metastatic) stage
at the time of clinical diagnosis and the refractory nature to
conventional chemo and radiotherapy [1]. Recent studies

chemo resistance and disease recurrence in various
cancers including PC [4-6]. Therefore, our understanding
of the mechanism(s) of CSC enrichment and maintenance
will be critical in devising successful therapeutic strategies
against the lethal PC.
Membrane bound mucins represent a special
class of type-I transmembrane proteins capable of
sensing the extracellular milieu with the large extended
extracellular domain and participate in cellular signaling
with the carboxyl-terminal fragment that is hypothesized
to be released following proteolytic cleavage [7-10].
Interestingly, these transmembrane mucins are proposed
to possess the ability to cleave (autoproteolytic and/
or by proteases) off the C-terminal region from the rest
of the protein primarily at the membrane proximal SEA
(Sperm protein, Enterokinase and Agrin) domain with
the exception of MUC4, which does not have one [1113]. In recent years a lot of interest has been generated
in the involvement of mucin cytoplasmic tail, particularly
MUC1-Cter, in cellular signaling rather than just a
structural component. Although MUC1 is the best
characterized transmembrane mucin with respect to
cleavage and oncogenic signaling [7,12,14], targeting
MUC1 has not been quite successful. Multiple mucins are
expressed by the same patients; therefore, it is important
to understand the common and unique features of these
predominant mucins for devising successful mucin based
therapeutic targeting.
MUC16, the largest known transmembrane mucin,
is encoded by 22,152 amino acids comprised of a heavily
glycosylated N-terminal region encompassing the tandem
repeat region with > 60 repeats of ~156 amino acids each
in which most of the SEA domains are interspersed, a
transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail domain
(CTD) of 32 amino acids [9,10,15]. It acts as a precursor
for CA125, most widely used serum biomarker for ovarian
cancer (OC), that are located as the repetitive peptide
epitopes in the large glycosylated N-terminal region of
MUC16, therefore, is of high clinical importance [16].
However, our understanding of the biological role of
MUC16, particularly during oncogenesis, is very limited.
Recent studies show that in addition to OC, MUC16 is
expressed in multiple cancer types and is associated with
poor prognosis [17,18]. Further, MUC16 knockdown
studies in breast, ovarian and PC cells associated it in
imparting protumorigenic, prometaststic, chemo resistant
and anti-apoptotic properties to cancer cells [19-23].
In addition, ectopic expression of different lengths of
carboxyl-terminal MUC16 (283 and 413 amino acids)
in ovarian, colon and breast cancer cells resulted in
increased metastatic and chemo resistant properties,
suggesting it to be critical in mediating the functions of
MUC16 [19,20,24]. Our understanding, however, of the
existence and generation of a cleaved MUC16 and its
role in tumorigenesis is still limited. In another study,
we performed in-depth analysis of MUC16 cleavage
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and have shown its cleavage to be distinct from the
previously predicted sites (Das et al., submitted for
publication elsewhere). Generation of the cleaved
MUC16 in our experimental system is further supported
by the endogenous existence of a ~17 kDa MUC16-Cter
fragment carried out using an in-house antibody for the
CTD of MUC16 in NHBE cells [25].
Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) belongs to a family of
nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase implicated
in multiple cellular processes primarily mediated by
the phosphorylation induced dimerization and nuclear
translocation of its target proteins signal transducers and
activators of transcription (STATs) [26,27]. Classically,
JAK2 has been shown to be active only in the cytoplasm,
however, recent studies in hematopoietic cells and
embryonic stem cells suggest an unusual nuclear role
of JAK2 in up regulating genes such as LMO2 [28] and
NANOG [29] implicated in inducing stem cell-like features
during carcinogenesis [30-32].
In our previous study, we showed de novo
expression of MUC16 in the high-grade preneoplastic
lesion, primary as well as metastatic PC with metastatic
tumors having stronger MUC16 expression compared
to the primary tumors from the same patient [33]. In the
present study, we report (i) the generation of a 17-kDa
cleaved MUC16 (MUC16-Cter) using dual-epitope tagged
114 amino acids of carboxyl-terminal MUC16 in PC cells,
(ii) MUC16-Cter mediated enrichment of ALDH+ cancer
stem-like cells imparts tumorigenic, metastatic and drug
resistant properties to PC cells and (iii) MUC16-Cter
mediated enrichment of stemness specific genes LMO2
and NANOG is dependent on nuclear JAK2.

RESULTS
Expression of dual-tagged 114 amino acids of
carboxyl-terminal MUC16 generates a ~17
kDa cleaved MUC16 and imparts proliferative
advantage to PC cells
Although previous studies addressed the functional
significance of various lengths of carboxyl-terminal
MUC16 fragments (283 and 413 amino acids) in ovarian,
breast and colon cancer cells, none demonstrated whether a
cleaved MUC16 is generated following ectopic expression
of these fragments [19,24,34]. Since the cleavage of
MUC16 in the last (56th) SEA domain is predicted to be at
‘NFSPLARRVDR’ site that lies 50 residues upstream to
the transmembrane domain in the last SEA domain [10],
we reasoned that use of carboxyl-terminal 114 amino acids
that includes the above mentioned cleavage site would be
the smallest fragment that can generate the functional
cell-associated MUC16. Due to lack of antibodies for the
juxta-membrane region of MUC16, we generated a dual

A study by Seelenmeyer C et al., demonstrated that a
C-terminal 1148 amino acid fragment of MUC16, despite
lacking a putative N-terminal signal peptide is trafficked
to the cell surface by the conventional secretory pathway
(Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi) [35]. This finding has also
been extrapolated to be true for the full length MUC16
(22,152 amino acids) lacking a putative N- terminal signal
peptide (based on the Uniprot database) [35]. Since we
are expressing much smaller fragments, we compared the
influence of the leader peptide on MUC16-Cter expression
and localization. For this, we used a p3X-FLAG- CMV10
vector system, which lacks the preprotrypsin leader and
compared it with the p3X-FLAG-CMV9. Sub cellular
distribution of MUC16-Cter (F114HA) was assessed
using CMV9 and CMV10 expression system by indirect
immunofluorescence microscopy under non-permeabilized
(NP) and permeabilized conditions in HeLa cells. Under
non-permeabilized condition, MUC16 C-ter expressed
from the CMV9 system was displayed on the cell surface,

epitope-tagged mammalian expression construct using 114
carboxyl-terminal fragment of MUC16 with N-terminal
FLAG-tag and a C-terminal HA-tag (Figure 1A). The
resultant control (p3X-FLAG-CMV9 or CMV9) and
MUC16-Cter (p3X-FLAG-114HA or F114HA) expression
constructs were stably transfected into MUC16 nonexpressing MiaPaCa-2 and expressing T3M4 PC cells.
Expression of MUC16-Cter was verified by immunoblot
and immunofluorescence analyses using anti-FLAG and
anti-HA antibodies (Figures 1B and 1C). A unique ~17
kDa product representing the cleaved carboxyl-terminus of
MUC16 was present in HA but not in FLAG-immunoblot
(Figure 1B). Although we are not able to show cleavage of
endogenous MUC16 owing to commercial unavailability
of CTD specific antibody, Davies et al., [25] using an
antibody against MUC16 CTD (developed in-house),
demonstrated a similar ~17 kDa cleaved product in NHBE
cells. This supports our findings in the ectopic expression
system.

which was not observed when expressed from the CMV10
system, assessed using the N- terminal FLAG antibody
(Supplemental Figures 1B and 1F). This suggests the
requirement of a leader peptide for appropriate routing
to cell surface. On the other hand, when HA- antibody
was used neither the CMV9 nor the CMV10 system
had any staining under NP condition (Supplemental
Figures 1B and 1F). A similar study was conducted
using permeabilized condition, where the distribution of
the FLAG and HA- tagged products were significantly
different in both systems. While CMV10 had mostly
cytoplasmic distribution (Supplemental Figure 1H), the
CMV9 system showed more punctate, membranous and
nuclear distribution (Supplemental Figure 1D). Therefore,
all our studies were conducted using the vector system
with N-terminal leader peptide (p3X-FLAG-CMV9).
To investigate whether MUC16-Cter imparts any
pro-tumorigenic functions to PC cells, in vitro proliferation
was measured using WST1 assay. Both MiaPaca-2 and

T3M4-F114HA cells exhibited a significant increase in
the proliferative potential with a ~ 6 – 7 h reduction in the
doubling time (Figure 1D and 1E, *P<0.05, **P<0.001)
compared to the control (CMV9) cells.

MUC16-Cter promotes G2/M block with
apoptotic resistance, a property associated with
cancer stem-like cells, in PC cells
Previously MUC16 was shown to induce rapid
G2/M transition in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [23].
However, cell cycle analysis to gaze at the role of MUC16
C-ter in PC cells, resulted in significant accumulation of
cells in the G2/M phase (Figure 2A, P=0.03) as opposed
to rapid G2/M transition [23]. Interestingly, this was
unaccompanied by an increase in apoptosis (Figure
2B), a property expected of cells blocked in the G2/M
phase. Extended G2/M phase with increased resistance

to apoptosis is a property commonly ascribed to cancer
stem cells (CSCs) [36-38]. To examine whether ectopic
expression of MUC16-Cter confers CSC phenotype in PC
cells, ALDH activity was measured that is shown to be
more relevant [39] and efficient [40] in identification of
PC stem cells. Accordingly, we observed more than twofold increase in the ALDH+ populations in cells expressing
MUC16-Cter compared to control cells (Figure 2C).

hematopoietic [28] and embryonic stem cells [29] have
demonstrated that nuclear JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosine
41 of histone H3 (H3Y41) in a STAT-independent
manner, up regulating LMO2 and NANOG. Both LMO2
and NANOG have been shown to induce stem cell-like
features during carcinogenesis [30-32]. An increase in the
total JAK2 protein with no alterations in its down-stream
effectors (Figure 3A) was observed in both MiaPaCa-2
and T3M4 PC cells expressing MUC16-Cter. No change
in JAK2 mRNA was observed (Supplemental Figure
2A). Next, nuclear JAK2 level was assessed using subcellular fractionation of control and F114HA transfected
MiaPaCa-2 and T3M4 cells. An increased nuclear JAK2
was observed in response to MUC16-Cter expression
(Figure 3B) suggesting its involvement in mediating
the functions of MUC16-Cter. To circumvent the use of
same source (rabbit) antibodies for JAK2 and HA-tag
(MUC16-Cter) in immunofluorescence for colocalization
analysis, we used a C-terminal Myc-tagged version of

MUC16-Cter mediated up regulation of LMO2
and NANOG is dependent on JAK2
Having observed an accumulation of cells in the
G2/M phase with apoptotic resistance, we sought to
investigate the mechanism of MUC16-Cter mediated
enrichment of ALDH+ population. For this we focused
on JAK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, for two reasons.
First, JAK2 has been shown to interact with MUC16
possibly by its FERM domain [23]. Second, studies in

Figure 3: MUC16-Cter mediated increased nuclear JAK2 leads to up regulation of LMO2 and NANOG. (A) MUC16-

Cter leads to increase in total JAK2. Whole cell lysates from control (CMV9) and MUC16-Cter expressing (F114HA) PC cells were
immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. (B) Control and MUC16-Cter expressing PC cells were lysed and nuclear (NE) and cytosolic (CE)
fractions were isolated. Western blots were performed on the subcellular fractions with indicated antibodies. (C) Immuno-colocalization of

untransfected cells were marked with white and yellow lines respectively. Scale bars, 5 μm. (D) Nuclear JAK2 leads to up regulation of
LMO2 and NANOG. Total RNA isolated from control and MUC16-Cter expressing cells was used as a template for synthesis of cDNA and

114 amino acids of MUC16-Cter construct (HA114Myc)
in pSecTag2C vector with Igκ leader peptide. HeLa cells
transiently transfected with a C-terminal Myc-tagged
version of MUC16-Cter showed increased total and
nuclear JAK2 (cells outlined in white line) compared to
cells that are untransfected (cells outlined in yellow line)
(Figure 3C). In addition, both MUC16-Cter (using antimouse Myc-tag antibody) and JAK2 (anti-rabbit antibody)
were colocalized in the nucleus (Figure 3C). In accordance
with the increased nuclear JAK2, target genes such as
LMO2 and NANOG were up regulated in cells expressing
MUC16-Cter compared to control cells (Figure 3D). A
more pronounced effect of MUC16-Cter is observed in
LMO2 expression compared to NANOG in T3M4 (Figure
3D) and Jak2+/+ mammary tumor cells (Figure 4D). In
addition, inhibition of JAK2 in K562 cells by TG101209
demonstrates a significant abrogation of LMO2 expression

with no influence on NANOG expression (Supplemental
Figure 2D). Taken together, all the above data suggests
that MUC16-Cter mediated nuclear JAK2 exerts a more
robust effect on LMO2 expression compared to NANOG
and could be one of the reasons for not observing a
statistically significant NANOG expression in T3M4 cells
(Figure 3D).
It has been shown that phosphorylation of tyrosine
41 of histone 3 (H3Y41) by JAK2 leads to interference
with the binding of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α)
on the promoters of LMO2 and NANOG resulting in
their up regulation. Due to lack of commercial antibody
specific for phospho-H3Y41, we immunoprecipitated H3
from the control and MUC16-Cter expressing MiaPaCa-2
and T3M4 cells followed by immunoblotting with the
general phosphotyrosine antibody. An increased tyrosine
phosphorylation of histone H3 (pTyr-H3) was observed

in cells expressing MUC16-Cter (Figure 4A and 4B)
compared to control. To further demonstrate that up
regulation of LMO2 and NANOG by MUC16-Cter is
indeed dependent on JAK2, MUC16-Cter (F114HA) was
expressed in mouse mammary cancer cells with (Jak2+/+)
and without Jak2 (Jak2–/–) [41] (Figure 4C). Mouse
mammary cancer cells with intact Jak2 (Jak2+/+) resulted
in up regulation of Lmo2 and Nanog in MUC16-Cter
dependent manner and this dependence was abrogated in
cells genetically deleted for Jak2 (Jak2–/–) (Figure 4D).
Similar findings of up regulated LMO2 and NANOG
were observed in response to a JAK2 specific inhibitor
TG101209 in MiaPaCa-2 cells and that was independent

of MUC16-Cter expression (Supplemental Figures 2B
and 2C). However, TG101209 resulted in significant
down regulation of LMO2 in K562 chronic myelogenous
leukemia cell line (Supplemental Figure 2D) as reported
previously [28]. Although the levels LMO2 and NANOG
are high in the absence of JAK2, we conclusively
demonstrate the JAK2 dependence of MUC16-Cter in
up regulating LMO2 and NANOG in cells that express
JAK2. While NANOG has been widely implicated in
stemness [32] and early stage PC [31], LMO2 is not
well characterized in PC with the exception of one study
associating it with better prognosis [42]. Thus our study
reveals MUC16-Cter-JAK2-LMO2/NANOG axis to be a

Expression of MUC16-Cter leads to increased
motility of PC cells

novel pathway responsible for mediating enrichment of
PC cancer stem-like cells.

MUC16-Cter imparts chemo resistance properties
to PC cells

Approximately 85–95% of PC patients are diagnosed
with either locally advanced or metastatic disease [4345] and a previous study from our lab demonstrated that
MUC16 expression is much stronger in metastatic lesions
compared to the primary pancreatic tumor [33]. Therefore,
we investigated the role of MUC16-Cter in PC cell
motility using live imaging of scratch assay (Figure 6A) as
well as uncoated porous membranes of 8 µm pore diameter
(Boyden chamber). The speed of migration was found to
be significantly higher in both MiaPaCa-2 (P=0.005) and
T3M4 (P=0.02) cells expressing MUC16-Cter compared
to control (Figure 6A). Similar observation was made in
MiaPaCa-2-F114HA cells (P=0.0007) compared to control
using Boyden chamber assay (Figures 6B and 6C). We did
not observe any migration of T3M4 cells using Boyden
chamber assay. In agreement with the increased motility,
increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
was observed in cells with MUC16-Cter (Figure 6D)
compared to control cells.

Our previous results showed that MUC16-Cter leads
to enrichment of ALDH+ CSCs. Accumulating evidence
over the last decade has demonstrated the significance
of CSCs in chemo resistance and metastasis in various
cancers including PC [4-6]. Therefore, we assessed the
chemo resistance properties of cells transfected with
MUC16-Cter and observed a significant reduction in
the cytotoxicity of both MiaPaCa-2 and T3M4 cells
expressing MUC16-Cter compared to control in response
to chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine and
cisplatin (Figures 5A-5D).

Figure 6: MUC16-Cter promotes motility of PC cells in vitro. (A) Cell migration of control and F114HA transfected MiaPaCa-2

and T3M4 PC cells was monitored by live imaging of a scratch every 10 minutes interval for 48 hours in 1% serum-containing media with

migration (mean ± s.e.m, n=3) was calculated by a ratio of distance migrated over time. . (B and C) Control (CMV9) and MUC16-Cter
(F114HA)-transfected MiaPaCa-2 cells were seeded onto filters with an 8 μm pore size in uncoated (Boyden’s chamber) upper chambers

chemo attractant. A representative image shows the motile cells in (B) that are quantitated in (C). Bars represent the average number of cells
(mean ± s.e.m) per field (10 fields per chamber) and three chambers (n=3) per cell type. (D) Up regulation of FAK phosphorylation in cells

were monitored weekly for tumor growth and metastasis
using in vivo bioluminescent imaging (Figure 7A). A
significantly higher tumor growth and metastasis were

We demonstrated that MUC16-Cter imparts
proliferative, invasive and chemo resistance properties
to PC cancer cells in vitro in addition to enrichment of
ALDH+ CSCs. Next, we sought to investigate the in vivo
relevance of MUC16-Cter with respect to tumorigenesis
and metastasis using an orthotopic model of PC. To
track the development and metastasis of PC growth in

During autopsy of these mice, weights of the primary
tumors were measured and were found to be significantly
higher for both MiaPaCa-2 (P=0.009) and T3M4 (P=0.04)
cells expressing MUC16-Cter (Figure 7C). Significant
metastatic burden was observed in the diaphragm and
peritoneum of mice implanted with cells expressing
MUC16-Cter, which was quantified as the total GFP
flux (photons/sec) using ex vivo GFP imaging of various
organs (Figure 7D and Supplementary Figures 3A and
3B). In particular, peritoneal metastasis was significantly
higher and was macroscopically visible to the naked eye
(Supplemental Figure 3A). Histologically expression
of HA-tagged MUC16-Cter was confirmed both at the
primary and metastatic sites, demonstrating that the
expression of MUC16-Cter was maintained all through
the process of formation of primary and metastatic PC in
vivo (Supplemental Figures 3C and 3D). Taken together,
we demonstrate for the first time generation of a ~17 kDa
cleaved MUC16 that is capable of promoting tumorigenic
and metastatic spread of PC cells in vivo.

our assessment of CSCs using ALDH activity, which
is shown to be more relevant [39] and efficient [40] in
identifying the PC tumor initiating cells compared to
CD133, showed MUC16-Cter mediated enrichment of
ALDH+ CSCs. The enrichment of ALDH+ CSCs suggests
MUC16/CA125 may not be just a passive biomarker
in recurrent metastatic OC [50] but could be actively
involved in the recurrence by inducing CSC like features.
As early-disseminated CPCs with CSC like features are
considered to the primary mode of establishing metastatic
PC [2], an increased expression of MUC16 in metastatic
PC compared to primary tumors [33] suggests the role of
MUC16-Cter to be critical in this process. Accordingly, we
observed significantly higher tumorigenic and metastatic
ability of cells expressing MUC16-Cter in vitro and
in vivo compared to control. Of all the metastatic sites,
MUC16-Cter mediated peritoneal metastasis in MUC16
non-expressing MiaPaCa-2 cells was interesting because,
our previous study [51] using ectopic expression of MUC4
in these cells (MUC4 is not expressed in MiaPaCa-2)
primarily resulted in liver metastasis. This is important
from two aspects. First, this demonstrates that different
mucins exhibit different metastatic tissue tropism and
therefore explains the requirement of expression of more
than one mucin in the same patient. Second, MUC16 is a
critical mediator of peritoneal metastasis of OC cells by its
interaction with mesothelin [52]. Therefore, MUC16-Cter
mediated enhanced peritoneal metastasis in PC is probably
reminiscent of its role in OC. However, further studies will
be required to elucidate its exact molecular mechanism in
PC.
Another important aspect of CSC is imparting
chemoresistance. A previous study [20] using a 283aa
long MUC16-Cter showed increased resistance of SKOV3
cells to cisplatin, however the mechanism was unknown.
Here, we provide evidence that MUC16-Cter leads to
enrichment of ALDH+ CSCs that is at least in part provides
resistance to gemcitabine and cisplatin in PC cells.
Mechanistically, we demonstrated that MUC16Cter results in nuclear translocation of JAK2, which
preferentially phosphorylates histone-3 and up regulates
stemness-specific genes such as LMO2 and NANOG,
which was further validated using Jak2 deficient (Jak2–
/–
) mouse mammary tumor cells. However, higher basal
levels of LMO2/Lmo2 and NANOG/Nanog in cells with
JAK2 inhibition or Jak2 deletion suggests multiple factors
influencing the expression of LMO2/Lmo2 and NANOG/
Nanog. On the other hand, K562 cells showed expected
down regulation of LMO2 upon JAK2 inhibition. The
effectiveness of JAK2 inhibition in K562 cells, but not in
epithelial tumor cells is probably one of the reasons why
JAK2 inhibitors are more widely used in clinical trials of
hematological malignancies but not of the epithelial solid
tumors.
Our basic understanding of the functional and
mechanistic involvement of MUC1-Cter in tumorigenesis

DISCUSSION
MUC16 was initially identified as CA125 and is
the most widely used serum biomarker particularly for
recurrent OC following chemotherapy [46,47]. Recently,
it was shown to be over expressed in multiple cancers
including PC [17,18,33,48] and was flagged as the third
most frequently mutated gene across tumor types [49].
Carboxyl-termini of transmembrane mucins generated
following cleavage are hypothesized to be the business
end of these proteins in multiple malignancies, but is
shown only for MUC1. Although MUC16 is predicted to
undergo proteolytic cleavage in the last and/or penultimate
SEA domains close to the transmembrane domain [10,13],
its precise cleavage has not been experimentally validated.
A more detailed study addressing MUC16 cleavage shows
that the cleavage is distinct from the predicted sites (Das
et al., submitted for publication elsewhere). Therefore,
one of the most important findings of the current study
is the demonstration of a ~17 kDa cleaved MUC16 in PC
cells using a dual-epitope tagged 114 carboxyl-terminal
amino acids (F114HA), which was not shown by previous
studies addressing the role of carboxyl-terminal MUC16
[19,20,24,34]. Support towards the endogenous existence
of such ~17 kDa fragment comes from a study using inhouse antibody for the CTD of MUC16 in NHBE cells
[25].
Cells blocked at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle
with apoptosis resistance are shown to possess features
of CSCs with increased proliferative capacity [36-38]
in multiple tumors. Similar characteristics of G2/M
accumulation with apoptosis resistance and increased
proliferative potential were observed in MiaPaCa-2
and T3M4 cells ectopically expressed with F114HA,
that generates a functional cleaved MUC16. Further,

resulted in development of peptide inhibitors such
as GO-203-2C, which is under phase-I clinical trial
(NCT01279603) against patients with advanced solid
tumors and lymphoma. Here, we showed generation of
a functional cleaved MUC16 that imparts tumorigenic,
metastatic and drug resistant properties to PC cells
partly by enrichment of ALDH+ CSCs, which in turn is
dependent on nuclear JAK2 mediated up regulation of
stemness specific genes LMO2 and NANOG. Therefore,
it is conceivable that therapeutic strategies that can be
targeted against MUC16-Cter will be critical in treating
MUC16 expressing pancreatic cancer patients. We propose
that this can be achieved in two different ways.
First, preventing cleavage of MUC16 will lead
to reduced nuclear translocation (Das et al., submitted
for publication elsewhere) and therefore have reduced
influence on gene expression. In this context, decreased
levels of LMO2 and NANOG leads to reduction in the
ALDH+ pancreatic CSCs. Besides, reduced cleavage
will lead to increased surface representation of MUC16
and therefore may enhance the efficacy of the CA125
antibody based therapeutics such as Oregovomab and
Abagovomab [16]. Our study demonstrates that brefeldin
A (BFA) that induces a rapid and reversible block in the
secretory pathway, prevents the cleavage of MUC16 (Das
et al., submitted for publication elsewhere). Therefore, it is
tempting to speculate the use of Breflate (a prodrug form
of brefeldin-A, NSC656202) [53] to prevent cleavage
of MUC16 and its associated tumorigenic functions as
an interesting therapeutic avenue owing to the increased
reliance of tumor cells on the secretory pathway than their
normal counterparts [53,54].
Second, of antibody based therapeutics using
antibodies against the juxta-membrane ectodomain and/
or cytoplasmic domain of MUC16 may prove to be more
effective than CA125 antibody based therapeutics such
as Oregovomab and Abagovomab that are met with very
limited success [16]. One of the reasons for the failure
of these antibodies is binding of these antibodies to
circulating (shed) MUC16 i.e CA125, reducing the drug
delivery to target cells [16]. This can be overcome by
using antibody-based therapeutics against the carboxylterminal MUC16. Therefore, further basic understanding
of the mechanism(s) of MUC16 cleavage, nuclear
translocation and biology of MUC16-Cter in addition to
development of novel antibodies that can effectively bind
to the cell associated MUC16-Cter would be critical in
devising successful mucin based therapeutic strategies
against multiple tumor types including PC.

Cell culture and transfections
HeLa and pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 and
T3M4 were grown in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS/antibiotics. MiaPaCa-2 cells were established from
the tumor in pancreas of a Caucasian male and harbors
the most commonly found KRASG12D oncogenic mutations
observed in PC patients. Phenotypically, these cells are
large with abundant cytoplasm, display aneuploidy and
possess a tendency to grow in multiple layers [55,56].
T3M4 cells were established from a primary exocrine
pancreatic carcinoma of a Japanese male and were
also found to harbor KRASG61H oncogenic mutations.
These cells grow in a monolayer sheet with epithelial
morphology resembling that of the original tumor [57,58].
K562 cells (kind gift from Dr. Javed Iqbal, UNMC) were
grown in suspension culture in RPMI-medium with 10%
FBS/antibiotics. MMTV-Neu; Jak2fl/fl cells transfected
with either pBabe-Puro or pBabe-Puro-Cre were grown
in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS/
antibiotics and 7 µg/ml puromycin [41]. MiaPaCa-2
and T3M4, HeLa and MMTV-Neu;Jak2fl/fl cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MiaPaCa-2
and T3M4 cells were selected for G418 (400-600 µg/ml)
resistance to generate the stable cells. These stable cells
were maintained in 400 µg/ml G418 only except during
the experimental procedure. Both MiaPaCa-2 and T3M4
cells transfected with control (CMV9) and MUC16-Cter
(F114HA) plasmids were stably transduced with lentivirus
expressing firefly luciferase and eGFP (GeneCopoeia) for
monitoring tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

Plasmids and cloning strategy
Plasmids and constructs used in this study were
generated for the purpose of studying MUC16 cleavage
and is submitted for publication elsewhere (Das et al.,
submitted for publication elsewhere). Briefly, standard
PCR and molecular cloning techniques were used to make
constructs. For expression in the mammalian system, p3XFLAG-CMV9 and p3X-FLAG-CMV10 (Sigma-Aldrich)
(termed as F114HA) and pSecTag2C (Invitrogen – Life
Technologies) (termed as HA114Myc) plasmids were used
where DNA fragments encoding the carboxyl-terminal
region of MUC16 (114 amino acids) was amplified by
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and was cloned into
the respective expression vectors. The primers used in the
generation of the constructs are outlined in Supplemental
Table-1. All the constructs were verified by sequencing.

assay. To monitor migration rate scratches were made in
confluent cell cultures grown in 6-well plates and were
placed into a live cell-imaging incubator (37° C, 5%
CO2), incubated for 48 h in DMEM+1% FBS. Cells were
visualized with an Olympus IX81 motorized inverted
microscope (Olympus America Inc) and the images were
analyzed with Slidebook version 5.5 (Intelligent Imaging
Innovations). Speed of migration was calculated by a ratio
of distance travelled (μm) over time (h) taken at three
different positions for each well. In addition, the migratory
potential of MiaPaCa-2 cells was also tested using 6-well
inserts of 8 μm pore size (BD Biosciences) as described
previously [51].

For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in
IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH-7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5
mM EDTA, 1% NP-40) containing complete protease
inhibitor cocktail, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF and 1 mM
PMSF on ice for 30 minutes. Cell lysates were clarified
by centrifugation and were immunoprecipitaed with
indicated antibodies overnight at 4° C. Protein complexes
were isolated by incubation with Protein-A, Protein-G or
Protein-A/G Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for 2-4 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3-5 times with
IP buffer, boiled with SDS sample buffer and analysed
by immunoblotting as described below using indicated
antibodies.

In vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis assay

Immunoblotting

Six-week-old nude mice were anaesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (10 mg/kg) and
ketamine (100 mg/kg). A left lateral laparotomy was
performed on the abdomen and MiaPaCa-2 (3x106)
and T3M4 (2.5x105) cells suspended in 50 μl of PBS
were injected into the head of the pancreas. In vivo
bioluminescent imaging was performed on indicated

intraperitoneal injections of 100 μl D-luciferin (150 mg/
kg) under isoflurane anaesthesia. After 42 (for MiaPaCa-2
cells) or 30 days (for T3M4 cells) mice were sacrificed,
metastasis to distant organs was evaluated by ex vivo
GFP imaging using Xenogen IVIS-100, weight of the
primary tumors was documented. Total bioluminescence
photon flux (photons/second) and total GFP fluorescence
photon flux (photons/second) were analyzed by region of
interest measurements in Living Image 4.4 (Perkin Elmer).
These raw data were normalized to controls. University
of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Animal Care
