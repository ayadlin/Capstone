Abstract
Breast tumor kinase (Brk), an Src-like nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase, is overexpressed in breast cancer and several other
cancer types. Our previous study indicates that Brk promotes
cell migration and tumor invasion by phosphorylating the
focal adhesion protein paxillin. Here, we report the identification of p190RhoGAP-A (p190) as a Brk substrate. Brk
phosphorylates p190 at the Y1105 residue both in vitro and
in vivo, thereby promoting the association of p190 with
p120RasGAP (p120). As a consequence, Brk stimulates p190
and attenuates p120 functions, leading to RhoA inactivation
and Ras activation, respectively. In carcinoma cells expressing
high levels of Brk, endogenous Brk functions as a key contributor to epidermal growth factor–induced p190 tyrosine
phosphorylation. We present evidence showing that p190
phosphorylation plays essential roles in both migratory and
proliferative effects of Brk. Furthermore, disruption of p190
phosphorylation–induced p190/p120 complex in breast
cancer cells abolishes not only the abilities of Brk to regulate RhoA and Ras but also the stimulatory effects of Brk
on proliferation, migration, invasion, transformation, and
tumorigenicity. Together, our findings reveal a previously
unknown function of Brk in regulating both RhoA and Ras by
phosphorylating p190 and provide evidence for the crucial
roles of this Brk-elicited signaling pathway in promoting
breast malignancy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7779–87]

Introduction
Unraveling the signaling pathways responsible for the establishment of malignant phenotype in carcinoma cells is of crucial
importance for the understanding of the pathology of cancer.
Aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling has been shown to contribute to
various steps of tumor development and progression. Breast tumor
kinase (Brk) is an intracellular tyrosine kinase and possesses SH3,
SH2, and kinase domains in a similar arrangement to that of Src
(1). However, Brk lacks an NH2 terminal myristoylation signal (1)
and its genomic sequence is distinct from Src family kinases (2).
Brk was identified from a human metastatic breast tumor (1), and
subsequent analysis revealed Brk overexpression in about two

thirds of primary breast tumors, with the highest level in advanced
tumors (3–5). This Brk overexpression positively correlates with the
expression of HER family receptors (4, 6). In normal tissues, the
expression of Brk is restricted to differential epithelial cells of skin
and gastrointestinal tract (7). In addition to breast tumors, elevated
expression of Brk has also been detected in metastatic melanoma
(8), colon tumors (7), T-cell lymphoma (9), and serous carcinoma of
ovary (10). In prostate cancers, although the expression of Brk is
not significantly elevated, Brk translocates from the nucleus to
cytoplasm during the progression of tumors (11).
Consistent with its potential role in promoting tumorigenesis,
Brk stimulates the proliferation of breast tumor cells and mediates
epidermal growth factor (EGF)–induced mitogenic and migratory
effects (5, 12, 13). The signaling mechanisms underlying the
mitogenic function of Brk, however, have not been completely
unraveled. Brk associates with EGF receptor after receptor
activation and enhances EGF-induced ErbB3 phosphorylation,
which subsequently leads to an increased recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and activation of Akt (14). Additionally, Brk
phosphorylates the growth inhibitory protein Sam68 and triggers
its nuclear export (15). Although these Brk-induced signaling
events are implicated in cell proliferation, their significance in the
tumor-promoting function of Brk remains elusive. In addition to
stimulating cell growth, Brk is a potent inducer of migration and
invasion. Our previous study revealed that this function of Brk is
mediated in part by its phosphorylation of paxillin, which leads to
the activation of Rac1 via the adaptor protein CrkII (13). Recently,
Brk was shown to mediate EGF-induced and HRG-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which contributes in part to the proliferation and migration of breast cancer
cells in response to these growth factors (5). It is unclear how
Brk triggers p38 MAPK activation. Identification of additional Brk
substrates and interacting proteins would allow a further understanding of the functional mechanisms of Brk in tumorigenesis.
p190RhoGAP-A (p190) is a potent inhibitor of RhoA (16) and was
identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with
p120RasGAP (p120) in v-Src transformed cells (17). The association
of p190 with p120 is promoted by phosphorylation of p190 at Y1105
(18). Additionally, phosphorylation at Y1087 in p190 stabilizes its
interaction with p120 (19). Although the formation of this RasGAP/
RhoGAP complex does not directly affect the catalytic activity of
p190, it promotes the recruitment of p190 to plasma membrane,
which correlates with an increased activity of p190 to inhibit Rho
in vivo (20). In contrast to this activation of RhoGAP, the RasGAP
activity of p120 is reduced when associated with p190 (21).
Thus, association of these two GTPase-activating proteins (GAP)
facilitates a cross-talk between Rho and Ras. The two tyrosine

kinases Src and Abl-related gene (Arg) have been reported to
directly phosphorylate p190 at Y1105 (18, 22). Src promotes p190
phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating
actin stress fiber disassembly (23). Intriguingly, both Src and Arg
are required for integrin-dependent phosphorylation and activation
of p190 in fibroblasts (24). The effects of p190 activation on cell
migration have been studied mainly in fibroblasts and seem to be
complex. While p190 activity plays important roles in promoting
cell spreading, membrane protrusion, and cell polarity (25), which
are all essential steps in cell locomotion, Arg acts through p190
to decrease cell contractility, thereby reducing motility (26). The
influence of p190 on growth factor–induced migration has not
been well studied.
In this study, we identified p190 as a substrate of Brk. Phosphorylation of p190 at Y1105 by Brk promotes the association of
p190 with p120, leading to Rho inactivation and Ras activation.
In carcinoma cells expressing high levels of Brk, endogenous Brk
contributes greatly to EGF-induced p190 phosphorylation. We
present evidence showing that p190 Y1105 phosphorylation and
consequent p190/p120 complex formation play crucial roles in the
transformation and tumorigenic effects of Brk in breast cancers.
Our findings reveal a previously unknown function of Brk in
regulating both RhoA and Ras by phosphorylating p190 and
provide mechanistic insights into the role of Brk in promoting
tumor formation and progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfection, and retroviral infection. 293T, HeLa, and
A431 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured in DMEM with 15% FCS. T47D
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids (NEAA), and 5 Ag/mL
insulin. MDA-MB231 and MCF7 cells were maintained in DMEM-F12 with
10% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 0.1 mmol/L NEAA. Transfection was
performed using Lipofectamine 200 reagent or by calcium phosphate
method. Recombinant retroviruses were generated according to procedures
described previously (27).
Plasmid constructions. The coding region of p190 was excised from
pKH3p190RhoGAP (provided by Sarah Parsons) and then subcloned to
pBabe-Hygro and pCMV-Taq-2B to generate retroviral and mammalian
expression vectors for p190, respectively. Various p190 mutants were
constructed by in vitro mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Strategene). The plasmid pGEX-p190 fragment (amino
acids 932–1143) was constructed by cloning the corresponding fragment to
pGEX-4T1. To generate lentiviral expression construct for the SH2-SH3-SH2
fragment of p120 (p1202-3-2), cDNA fragment for HA-tagged p1202-3-2 was
excised from pKHA232 (provided by Anthony Koleske) and then cloned to
pLenti6-GM-V5 vector (Invitrogen).
RNA interference. Lentivirus carrying Brk-specific or Src-specific small
interfering RNA (siRNA; from National RNAi Core Facility) was used to
knockdown Brk or Src, respectively. The target sequences of various siRNAs
are Src GCGGCTCCCAGATTGTCAACAA, Brk-1 AGTCGCAGAATTACATCCACC, and Brk-2 TACCTCTCCCATGACCACAAT. To generate recombinant
lentivirus, 293FT cells were cotransfected with the package, envelop, and
siRNA expressing constructs. The virus-containing supernatant was
harvested and then used to infect cells. and infected cells were selected
with puromycin.
Antibodies. Antibodies to tubulin, Ras, and phosphotyrosine (4G10)
were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, whereas antibodies to Brk,
RhoA, and p120 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody to p190
was from BD Transduction Laboratory, and the anti-Flag M2 antibody was
from Sigma. To generate Brk antibody capable of immunoprecipitation,
glutathione S-transferase (GST)–Brk SH3 domain was purified from

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

Escherichia coli using only the soluble fraction of bacterial lysate and
glutathione-sepharose beads. The purified fusion protein was used to
immunize rabbit and the resulting antiserum was affinity purified.
Assay for GTP-bound Rho, Rac, and Ras. The levels of GTP-bound Ras
and GTP-bound Rho were detected with the Raf-1 Ras binding domain
(RBD) agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) and GST-rhotekin pull-down assays,
respectively. Briefly, cells were lysed with buffer containing 25 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 10%
glycerol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 25 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 2 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 10 Ag/mL aprotinin.
The lysates were incubated with Raf-1 RBD agarose for 30 min at 4jC or
50 Ag of GST-rhotekin beads for 1 hr at 4jC. The beads were washed and
analyzed by Western blot to detect the bound Ras or Rho. GTP-bound Rac
was detected as previously described (13).
Migration and invasion assays. Transwell migration and invasion
assays using EGF as the chemoattractant were performed as described (13).
After incubation at 37jC for 7 hr ( for migration assay) or 24 hr ( for invasion
assay), cells remaining on the upper side of membrane were removed with a
cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the lower membrane surface were
fixed and stained with Hoechst 33342.
Immunoprecipitations and GST fusion proteins. Immunoprecipitations using cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins and
purification of GST fusion proteins with glutathione-sepharose beads were
performed as described (13).
In vitro kinase assay. One microgram of Brk purified from baculovirus
expression system (13) was incubated at 37jC for 10 min in 30 AL of kinase
buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L
MnCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 10 Amol/L ATP, 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP and 2 Ag p190 or
its mutants purified from transfected cells. Alternatively, 0.5 Ag GST-p190
fragment purified from E. coli was used as a Brk substrate. Substrate
phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with buffer containing 50 mmol/L NaCl,
300 mmol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L PIPES (pH 6.8), 3 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were blocked with PBS supplemented with 10%
goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 50 mmol/L NH4Cl, and
then incubated with 0.1 mmol/L rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin diluted
in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 5% goat serum. Cells were then washed,
mounted, and examined with a Carl Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning
microscope with a 63 objective lens.
Soft agar colony formation assay. 2.5  103 MDA-MB231 cell
derivatives were resuspended in 0.3% of top agar and spread onto 60-mm
plates containing 0.5% of bottom agar. Colonies formed after 4 wk were
stained and then counted by the ImageJ software.
Tumorigenesis in mice. Four-week-old BALB/c nude mice (n = 40;
National Laboratory Animal Center) were acclimated for 1 to 2 wk. The
mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and injected s.c. with
1  107 MDA-MB231 cell derivatives (n = 10 for each group) mixed with PBS
and Matrigel (vol/vol, 1:1). Tumor volumes were calculated using the
equation, width2  length  0.5.

Results
Brk inhibits stress fiber formation and promotes cell
spreading. To investigate the role of Brk in regulating actin
cytoskeletons, we examined the effect of endogenous Brk on
filamentous actin organization in serum-stimulated conditions.
Two Brk-specific siRNAs were stably introduced to HeLa cells, and
the Brk-2 siRNA induced a more efficient depletion of endogenous
Brk than the Brk-1 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Expression of
either Brk siRNA accelerated stress fiber formation in response to
serum stimulation, which was evident by the increase in percentage
of cells with stress fibers (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the Brk-2 siRNA
elicited a more profound effect on stress fiber induction than the
Brk-1 siRNA. This finding indicates that endogenous Brk inhibits
stress fiber formation. As actin cytoskeleton reorganization plays

immunoprecipitated from transfected cells or GST-p190
(932–1143) fragment purified from E. coli were incubated

reaction. The reaction products were analyzed by

(kinase assay) or by Western blotting with anti-p190
or anti-GST antibody. E, Brk promotes the interaction
of p190 with p120. HeLa cells transfected with Brk or

an important role in cell spreading, we investigated the influence
of Brk on cell spreading. Using the HeLa cell system described
above, we observed a significant inhibition of cell spreading by
either Brk-1 or Brk-2 siRNA, but not by control siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Consistent with the efficiencies in down-regulating
Brk, Brk-2 displayed a stronger inhibitory effect on spreading than
Brk-1. These data showed the function of Brk in regulating actin
cytoskeleton and promoting cell spreading.
Brk interacts with p190 and phosphorylates p190 at Y1105.
The inhibitory effect of Brk on actin stress fiber formation and
stimulatory effect on cell spreading resemble those of Rho
inactivation (28). In an attempt to characterize Brk-associated
proteins, we noticed that a tyrosine phosphorylated protein with a
molecular weight of >172 kDa was coprecipitated with Brk from
lysate of cells overexpressing Flag-Brk (Supplementary Fig. S2). As
the 190-kDa RhoGAP protein (p190) is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells overexpressing certain tyrosine kinases and this
phosphorylation promotes its Rho inactivating function (16), we

investigated whether Brk could associate with p190 to promote its
tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed
that p190 coprecipitated with Brk from lysates of HeLa cells overexpressing Flag-Brk (Supplementary Fig. S3). To show the association of endogenous Brk with endogenous p190, we generated a
Brk-specific antibody that could immunoprecipitate endogenous
Brk (Supplementary Fig. S4). With lysate of T47D cells, which
express a high level of endogenous Brk (5), we showed that this
anti-Brk antibody coprecipitated endogenous p190, whereas the
anti-p190 antibody pulls down endogenous Brk (Fig. 1B). This
specific interaction between Brk and p190 prompted us to
investigate whether p190 is a substrate of Brk. To this end, HeLa
cells were cotransfected with Brk and p190, and the level of p190
tyrosine phosphorylation was examined by immunoprecipitation
with the p190 antibody followed by Western blotting with the
phosphotyrosine antibody. This analysis revealed a marked
induction of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation by Brk overexpression
(Fig. 1C). To determine which tyrosine residue is involved in this

phosphorylation event, we mutated the Y1087 and/or Y1105 residues
as phosphorylation on these two residues is known to promote the
association of p190 with p120, thereby increasing the Rho
inactivating function of p190 (16). Whereas the Y1087 mutant was
phosphorylated at a level similar to that of the wild-type protein,
the Y1105 and Y1087/1105 double mutant (DYF) were barely
phosphorylated in cells overexpressing Brk (Fig. 1C). This result
suggests Y1105 as the major phosphorylation site for Brk. To
determine whether Brk could phosphorylate p190 in vitro, we
expressed recombinant Brk in baculovirus and purified it to near
homogeneity (Supplementary Fig. S5). This purified Brk was used
to phosphorylate full-length p190 or its mutants isolated from
transfected cells by immunoprecipitation. This in vitro phosphorylation assay showed a specific phosphorylation of p190 at
Y1105 by Brk (Fig. 1D, top). To rule out the possibility that this
phosphorylation resulted from a tyrosine kinase coprecipitated
with p190, we used bacterially expressed p190 (932–1143) fragment
as the substrate. As bacteria do not contain tyrosine kinase,
tyrosine phosphorylation on p190 should be attributed to Brk.
Again, Brk was capable of phosphorylating this purified p190
fragment (Fig. 1D, bottom). Furthermore, in both kinase assays, the
Y1087 mutant was phosphorylated at the same extent as the wildtype protein, whereas the Y1105 and DYF mutants were virtually
refractory to be phosphorylated by Brk, thus confirming Y1105 as
the major Brk phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation of p190 at
Y1105 is known to promote its binding to p120 (16). Accordingly, an
elevated association of p190 with p120 was observed in cell
overexpressing Brk, as revealed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation

analyses (Fig. 1E). Conversely, expression of BrkKM modestly
reduced the complex formation between p190 and p120. Together,
our results indicate that Brk can directly phosphorylate p190 at
Y1105, thereby facilitating the binding of p190 to p120.
Brk stimulates the functions of p190 to inactivate Rho and
to activate Ras. Phosphorylation of 190 at Y1105 is known to
stimulate its Rho-inactivating function (16). To examine the
influence of Brk on this function of p190, GST-rhotekin pull-down
assay was performed. Whereas transfection of Brk or p190 alone led
to a moderate or significant reduction of active Rho, respectively,
cotransfection of Brk and p190 resulted in a synergistic inhibition
of Rho activity (Fig. 2A). The Y1105F mutant of p190 still possessed
the Rho inactivation function, consistent with its carrying an intact
GAP domain. However, when this mutant was coexpessed with Brk,
no synergistic reduction of GTP-bound Rho was observed (Fig. 2A).
These data thus support that Brk stimulates the Rho inactivating
function of p190 through phosphorylating p190 at Y1105.
Complex formation between p190 and p120 was reported to
down-regulate the RasGAP activity of p120 (21), leading to an
elevation of Ras activity. Consistently, GST-RBD assay for GTPbound Ras revealed that overexpression of p190 stimulated Ras
activity, presumably via the formation of p190/p120 complex.
Expression of Brk alone modestly enhanced Ras activity, which may
be resulted from a functional interaction of Brk with endogenous
p190. Importantly, coexpression of Brk and p190 led to a further
stimulation of Ras activity (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the wild-type
p190, the p190 Y1105F mutant neither induced Ras activation nor
could it cooperate with Brk to affect Ras activity (Fig. 2B). These

for assaying GTP-bound Ras, as described in Materials and Methods, or for Western blot with antibodies, as indicated. The amounts of GTP-bound RhoA or
GTP-bound Ras were normalized by using those of total RhoA or Ras in cell lysates, respectively, and are expressed as the fold of induction relative to cells transfected
with the control vector. C, MCF7 cells stably expressing various siRNAs were lysed for Western blot with various antibodies or assayed for GTP-bound RhoA and

RhoA and GTP-bound Ras are quantified as in A and B. D, MCF7 cells stably expressing Brk-2 siRNA were transfected with p190. Cells were lysed for Western blot

data suggest that Brk-induced p190 Y1105 phosphorylation activates
Ras by sequestrating p120.
Having shown the ability of overexpressed Brk to cooperate with
p190 for Ras activation and Rho inactivation, we next determined
whether endogenous Brk could regulate Rho and Ras. To this end,
we used the breast cancer cell line MCF7, which expresses a
relatively high level of endogenous Brk (5). The two Brk-specific
siRNAs were stably introduced to MCF7 cells, and again, the Brk-2
siRNA elicited a more efficient depletion of endogenous Brk than
the Brk-1 siRNA (Fig. 2C). This Brk silencing induced an elevation
of Rho and reduction of Ras activities, and the extent of Ras
inactivation and Rho activation correlated with the knockdown
efficiency of these siRNAs (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S6A).
Intriguingly, overexpression of p190 in Brk-silencing MCF7 cells not
only abrogated Rho activation effect induced by Brk siRNA but also
partially rescued Ras activity (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Perhaps, the overexpressed p190 could be phosphorylated by other
tyrosine kinases in this cell system. Alternatively, other signals
might promote the association of overexpressed p190 with p120
through a p190 tyrosine phosphorylation-independent manner
(18). Regardless of the underlying mechanism, our data showed the
ability of endogenous Brk to oppositely regulate Rho and Ras and
suggested a critical role of p190 in mediating these activities of Brk
in breast cancer cells.
Brk mediates EGF-induced p190 tyrosine phosphorylation.
Next, we investigated whether Brk could mediate p190 phosphorylation in response to a physiologic stimulus. Our previous study
revealed that Brk kinase activity is activated by EGF signaling
(13). Intriguingly, Src kinase can also induce p190 phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated cells (18, 23). We thus determined the
possible involvement of Brk in EGF-induced p190 phosphorylation. In addition, the relative contribution of Brk and Src to this

www.aacrjournals.org

phosphorylation event was also investigated in human cancer cell
lines containing high levels of Brk, such as the epidermoid
carcinoma cell line A431 (13). We used Brk-specific and Srcspecific siRNAs to down-regulate Brk and Src in this cell line,
respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S7A, the
Brk-2 siRNA reduced Brk expression to f20%, which was similar
to the extent of Src down-regulation achieved by Src siRNA. The
Brk-1 again showed a weaker effect on Brk depletion than Brk-2.
Importantly, neither Brk-1 nor Brk-2 did nonspecifically affect the
expression of Src, whereas Src siRNA did not cause Brk downregulation. When the parental A431 cells were stimulated with
EGF, a marked induction of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation was
observed. However, this EGF-induced phosphorylation was
attenuated in cells expressing either Brk siRNA or Src siRNA.
Notably, although Brk-2 and Src siRNA elicited a similar efficiency
of down-regulating their cognate kinase, Brk-2 induced a more
profound effect on inhibiting EGF-triggered p190 tyrosine
phosphorylation (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S7B). To test
whether Brk mediates EGF-induced p190 tyrosine phosphorylation
in other cell systems, we used the breast carcinoma cell line T47D.
Again, the efficiency of Brk-2 siRNA to reduce Brk level was
comparable with that of Src siRNA to down-regulate Src (Fig. 3C
and Supplementary Fig. S7C). Similar to what was observed in
A431 cells, each of the Brk or Src siRNA could attenuate EGFinduced p190 tyrosine phosphorylation in T47D cells, and the
inhibitory effect of Brk-2 siRNA on this phosphorylation was
slightly more than that of Src siRNA (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S7D). As Brk does not affect Src activity (13), the reduction of
p190 phosphorylation by Brk silencing should not be attributed to
Src inactivation. Thus, these data indicate that both Brk and Src
are capable of mediating EGF-induced p190 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, in certain cancer cells that express high levels

of Brk, Brk could play a similar or even greater role in this
phosphorylation event compared with Src.
p190 is critical for the migratory and mitogenic effects of
Brk. Studies described above have identified Brk as a bona fide
kinase for p190 Y1105 residue in EGF-stimulated cells. Through this
phosphorylation and subsequent complex formation between p190
and p120, Brk elicited opposite effects on two GTPase proteins, Ras
and Rho. Then, the next important question was whether this
newly identified signaling pathway contributes to any biological
functions of Brk, such as cell migration and proliferation. To
evaluate the contribution of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation to the
migration-promoting function of Brk, we reconstituted the
expression of wild-type p190 or its phosphorylation-defective
(Y1105F) mutant in the MEFs derived from p190-null mice by
retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Subsequently, the resulting
MEFs were infected with retrovirus carrying Brk or control vector

and infected cells were selected. Notably, the p190 WT and Y1105F
(YF) mutant were expressed at a comparable level, and the three
Brk-expressing MEFs contained similar amounts of Brk (Supplementary Fig. S8). When these six populations of MEFs were assayed
for EGF-induced chemotactic migration, we found that expression of Brk led to a marked promotion of chemotactic migration
in MEFs carrying p190 WT (Fig. 4A). However, this migrationpromoting function of Brk was completely abrogated in cells
lacking p190 or expressing the p190 YF mutant. These results thus
showed an essential role of p190 Y1105 phosphorylation in Brkinduced migration.
Elevated Ras activity is well known to enhance cell proliferation.
The finding that Brk promotes Ras activation via p190 phosphorylation prompted us to investigate the contribution of this
phosphorylation event to Brk-induced proliferation. The six MEFs
described above were taken for assaying their growth. Brk elicited a

potent mitogenic effect in cells expressing p190 WT. However, in
p190-deficient cells or cells carrying p190 YF mutant, Brk only
modestly enhanced cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). Thus, p190
phosphorylation is a major pathway through which Brk promotes
cell proliferation.
As overexpression of p190 reversed at least partially the effects of
Brk siRNA on Rho and Ras regulations in MCF7 cells (see Fig. 2D),
we next investigated whether such overexpression could rescue the
migration and proliferation defects induced by Brk silencing.
Indeed, p190 overexpression greatly promoted migration and
proliferation of MCF7 cells expressing Brk siRNA (Fig. 5A and B).
These data support a critical role of p190 in the migratory and
mitogenic functions of Brk in breast cancer cells.
Disruption of the p190/p120 complex blocks the tumorpromoting activities of Brk in breast cancer cells. Having
shown important roles of p190 Y1105 phosphorylation in Brkinduced proliferation and migration, we next investigated whether

this phosphorylation event contributes to the tumor-promoting
activities of Brk. Previous studies revealed that a p120 construct
containing the SH2-SH3-SH2 domain (p1202-3-2) acts in a
dominant-negative fashion to block p120 binding to p190, thereby
eliminating the biological consequences of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation (20). This construct was stably introduced to the breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB231, which expresses a low level of
endogenous Brk (13), thus allowing the assessment of Brk tumorpromoting function by overexpression strategy. As expected,
expression of the p1202-3-2 fragment in MDA-MB231 cells disrupted
Brk-induced p190/p120 complex (Fig. 6A). Consequently, the Brkinduced RhoA inactivation and Ras activation were both inhibited
by the expression of p1202-3-2 fragment (Fig. 6B and Supplementary
Fig. S9). Consistent with our previous study, Brk overexpression in
MDA-MB231 cells promoted tumor cell migration and invasion
toward EGF (Fig. 6C). Importantly, these effects of Brk were abrogated by the expression of p1202-3-2 fragment. Brk overexpression

also increased the proliferation of MDA-MB231 cells and their
ability to form colonies on soft agar, and again, these effects were
greatly reduced in cells expressing p1202-3-2 fragment (Fig. 6C and
Supplementary Fig. S10). Finally, we evaluated the function of
p1202-3-2 fragment on Brk-induced tumor growth in a xenograft
model, in which mice were injected s.c. with the MDA-MB231
derivatives. Whereas overexpression of Brk accelerated tumor
growth in animal, expression of the p1202-3-2 fragment completely
reversed this effect of Brk (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S11).
Thus, disruption of the p190/p120 complex blocked the stimulatory
effects of Brk on proliferation, migration, invasion, transformation,
and tumorigenicity in breast cancer cells, indicating that p190
phosphorylation is an important mechanism through which Brk
promotes tumor formation and progression.

Discussion
In this study, we identify p190 as a substrate of Brk. Through
phosphorylating p190 at Y1105, Brk promotes the complex
formation between p190 and p120, thereby stimulating the RhoGAP
activity of p190 and inhibiting the RasGAP activity of p120. Thus,
this Brk-elicited signaling pathway leads to opposite regulations of
two GTPases, Ras, and Rho. We present several lines of evidence
indicating that p190 tyrosine phosphorylation contribute significantly to various functions of Brk in tumor promotion. First, the
mitogenic and migratory effects of Brk are greatly impaired in
cells lacking p190 or expressing a phosphorylation-defective p190
mutant. Second, overexpression of p190 in breast cancer cells
partially rescues the inhibitory effects of Brk siRNA on proliferation
and migration. Finally, disruption of the p190/p120 complex in
breast carcinoma cells with a dominant-negative p120 fragment
significantly diminishes the stimulatory effects of Brk on proliferation, migration, invasion, transformation, and tumor growth.
Thus, our study uncovers p190 Y1105 phosphorylation and its
downstream events as an important mechanism by which Brk
promotes breast tumor formation and progression. Targeting of
this pathway might develop a novel therapeutic approach for the
management of breast cancer.
We show that Brk is capable of mediating p190 tyrosine
phosphorylation under EGF-stimulated conditions. Three other
tyrosine kinases, i.e., Src, Fyn, and Arg, are known to phosphorylate
p190 and promote its interaction with p120. In certain circumstances, Brk and these kinases seem to regulate p190 phosphorylation at different tissue locations or physiologic settings. For
instance, Src, Fyn, and Arg are responsible for p190 phosphorylation during the development of brain (22, 29), wherein Brk
expression has not been reported. Additionally, Src and Arg are
required for p190 phosphorylation in response to integrin signaling
(24, 26), which however does not induce the catalytic activity of Brk
(13). Nevertheless, under EGF-treated conditions, Src similarly
promotes p190 phosphorylation (18, 23). Using siRNAs to downregulate Src or Brk, we showed that these two kinases play
redundant roles in EGF-stimulated p190 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in certain cancer cells that express high levels of Brk, Brk
contributes equally or even more significantly to this phosphorylation compared with Src. As previous reports revealed a high
correlation between Brk and ErbB2 overexpression in human
breast tumors (4, 6), we postulate that this coordinated expression
of Brk and ErbB2 would lead to a synergistic induction of p190
phosphorylation, thereby conferring the proliferative and migratory/invasive advantages on these tumors.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

Our study indicates that p190 Y1105 phosphorylation is important
for mediating Brk-induced cell proliferation, as this effect of Brk is
greatly impaired in cells lacking p190 or expressing a phosphorylation-defective p190 mutant. Although phosphorylation of p190
can coordinate a cross-talk between Rho and Ras, we postulate that
the growth-stimulating signal transduced by p190 phosphorylation
is predominantly mediated by Ras activation rather than Rho
inactivation. Accordingly, overexpression of the RhoGAP domain of
p190 inhibits, rather than stimulates, Ras-induced transformation
(30), whereas overexpression of a chimera made of p190 RhoGAP
domain and the COOH terminus of RhoA does not affect Rasinduced proliferation (31). Thus, p190 may possess complex and
context-dependent effects on proliferation through its GAP
domain-mediated Rho inactivation function and Y1105 phosphorylation-mediated Ras activation function. In line with this notion,
reconstitution of p190 in p190-null MEFs does not significantly
affect proliferation, whereas overexpression of p190 in MCF7 cells
partially rescues the proliferation inhibitory effect of Brk siRNA.
Additionally, it is worth noting that Brk can still elicit a weak
mitogenic effect in cells lacking p190, suggesting the involvement
of other pathways in Brk-induced proliferation.
Our previous study revealed phosphorylation of paxillin as one
mechanism through which Brk promotes migration and invasion
(13). In this study, we show that phosphorylation of p190 similarly
contributes to these effects of Brk. Intriguingly, the migrationpromoting function of Brk is completely lost in p190-null MEF,
although Brk should still be capable of phosphorylating paxillin
in such cell. Our finding suggests that phosphorylation of paxillin
alone is insufficient to promote migration. This notion is conceivable in viewing that the highly dynamic migration process
requires the integration of multiple signals and molecules in a
spatially and temporally coordinated fashion. Of note, Brk and p190
act in synergism to induce not only RhoA inactivation but Rac1
activation (Supplementary Fig. S12), consistent with an antagonistic cross-talk between RhoA and Rac1 (28). Similarly, paxillin
phosphorylation was reported to result in both Rac1 activation (13)
and RhoA suppression (32) at the leading edge of migrating cells,
which are both required for the formation of membrane protrusions (32, 33). Consistently, inhibition of Brk blocks lamellipodia formation in response to the EGF migratory cue (13).
Whereas we report a positive role of p190 phosphorylation in cell
locomotion, a previous study found that overexpression of a RhoAp190GAP domain fusion protein in a pancreatic cell line inhibits
EGF-induced invasion (31). Similarly, Arg-induced p190 phosphorylation in fibroblasts reduces motility by decreasing RhoA-induced
actomyosin contractility (26). One possibility is that, in our cell
systems, actomyosin contractility can be generated by other compensating mechanisms, such as the Cdc42-MRCK pathway (34).
Alternatively, the Brk-induced p190 phosphorylation may be
spatially restricted to the membrane vicinity and therefore does
not significantly affect the contractility of cell body.
Whereas this study reveals that p190 (p190-A) acts downstream
of Brk to promote breast tumor proliferation and migration, a
highly related p190-B was reported essential for mammary gland
development by regulating ductal morphogenesis (35). Interestingly, increased level of p190-B was found in a subset of mutageninduced mammary tumors (36) and inducible expression of p190-B
in mammary gland during pregnancy results in hyperplastic lesions
(37). Although these findings suggest a potential role of deregulated
p190-B in mammary malignancy, p190-B is probably not a
substrate of Brk, as the sequences flanking the residue equivalent

to Y1105 in p190-B are not conserved. Accordingly, p190-B is not
tyrosine phosphorylated in Src-transformed fibroblasts, where
p190-A is heavily phosphorylated (38). Future study will determine
whether p190-A is uniquely coupled to Brk signaling axis to
promote breast malignancy.
