Review of Major Adverse Effects of
Androgen-deprivation Therapy in
Men With Prostate Cancer
Lockwood G. Taylor, MPH1, Steven E. Canfield, MD2, and Xianglin L. Du, MD, PhD1,3

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is a common treatment for men with prostate cancer. Although ADT
is effective at suppressing prostate-specific antigen (PSA), stabilizing disease, alleviating symptoms in
advanced disease, and potentially prolonging survival, it is not without serious side effects. However, to the
authors’ knowledge, there is lack of a systematic review of its major adverse effects to date. The authors of
this report systematically reviewed and quantitatively assessed the literature on skeletal and cardiac side
effects associated with ADT in men with prostate cancer. The PubMed database was searched for relevant
published articles from 1966 to May 2008, and 683 articles were reviewed systematically from an original
20 different Medical Subject Heading search combinations. The focus of the review was on bone-related
and cardiovascular-related outcomes. When appropriate, results were pooled from articles on specific
adverse outcomes, summary risk estimates were calculated, and tests of heterogeneity were performed.
Fourteen articles were identified that met inclusion criteria from the original 683 studies. Men who underwent ADT for prostate cancer had a significantly increased risk of overall fracture of 23% (summary relative
risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.10-1.38) compared with men who had prostate cancer but
who did not undergo ADT. Furthermore, men who underwent ADT had a 17% increase in cardiovascularrelated mortality compared with men who did not undergo with ADT (summary hazards ratio, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.07-1.29). Significant elevations in the risk of diabetes also were observed from 2 large studies. ADT was
associated with an increased risk of skeletal fracture, incident diabetes, and cardiovascular-related mortality, although the absolute risk of these events was low. Preventive measures against these adverse effects
and careful assessment of patient’s baseline health status should be considered. Cancer 2009;115:2388–99.

Prostate cancer is the most common solid organ cancer among men in the US. The American Cancer
Society estimates that 186,320 incident cases will be diagnosed in 2008.1 Worldwide, over 679,000 cases
of prostate cancer were diagnosed in 2002.2 Prostate cancer mortality has been declining steadily over the
last 2 decades, which may be attributed to multiple reasons, including advances in treatment and early

detection of the disease.3,4 The most common form of
treatment for advanced prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which can take the form of either
surgical castration (orchiectomy) or chemical castration
(with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]). In
addition, ADT is used increasingly as adjuvant therapy
with radiotherapy for localized prostate cancers and as
salvage therapy for increasing prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels after localized treatment.5-7 The use of ADT
as primary therapy has been increasing steadily over the
last decade. A report by Shahinian et al indicated that use
of ADT increased steadily throughout the 1990s among
men of all ages with prostate cancer who had all stages and
grades of tumor.8 Another study by Cooperberg et al indicated that, next to surgery, primary ADT was the most
common treatment regimen for men with localized prostate carcinoma.9 ADT is effective at alleviating diseasespecific symptoms,5,10,11 and some evidence suggests that
it is effective at prolonging survival when used as an adjuvant with radiation therapy in patients with locally
advanced prostate cancer.6,12 Although it has been suggested that the use of primary ADT may directly prolong
survival in patients with prostate cancer,13 2 recent studies
indicated that primary ADT does not prolong
survival.14,15
Although ADT has been successful in improving overall quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer,
it is not without side effects. Common side effects associated
with ADT include skeletal complications, metabolic and
cardiovascular complications, sexual dysfunction, hot
flashes, periodontal disease, cognition, and mood disorders.5,16-21 Whereas these complications are significant and
may be associated with increased overall morbidity, skeletal,
metabolic, and cardiovascular complications are particularly
concerning because of their impact on morbidity as well as
mortality. It has been demonstrated that the administration
of ADT reduces bone mineral density (BMD),20,22,23 which
leads to the increased risk of skeletal fracture. It also has
been demonstrated that ADT decreases insulin sensitivity,24,25 cholesterol levels26,27 and the percentage of fat
mass,24 all of which are risk factors for diabetes and/or cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. The association
of ADT with these adverse outcomes, which may result in
additional serious morbidity or mortality, has important
clinical and public health implications for the treatment of
prostate cancer.

Although several reviews have been published on
ADT and its side effects,5,19,20 most reviews have not
been systematic and, to the best of our knowledge, have
not provided summary risk estimates for specific outcomes from the studies that used similar methodology.
Given the widespread use of ADT to treat prostate cancer
of all stages and the previously reported associations
between ADT and various adverse health outcomes, we
conducted a review that included summary risk estimates
for specific outcomes when appropriate to gain a better
understanding of the magnitude of skeletal and cardiovascular side effects from ADT in the treatment of prostate
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Selection of Studies
A National Library of Medicine PubMed search of MEDLINE citations was performed to identify English-language studies that were published from 1966 through
May 16, 2008. Although we searched studies that investigated all potential adverse outcomes from ADT, our primary objective was to identify studies that addressed the
incidence of bone- and cardiovascular-related outcomes
because of the frequency and public health significance of
these outcomes after treatment with ADT. We performed
20 separate searches combining any of the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms for adverse outcomes:
osteoporosis, fracture, bone density, bone loss, cardiovascular,
cardiovascular morbidity, cardiovascular events, diabetes,
heart, and side-effect with the following terms for ADT:
androgen-deprivation, ADT, GnRH agonist, lutenizing
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), androgen suppression,
and hormone therapy with prostate cancer. These separate
searches yielded 683 publications in aggregate. After
reviewing these 683 abstracts, we excluded any review
articles, case reports, case series, studies that focused on
therapies to alleviate the side effects (eg, bisphosphonates
or vitamin D supplementation given to men undergoing
ADT to prevent osteoporosis and fracture), and studies
that did not exclusively investigate bone-related and cardiovascular-related adverse side effects of ADT. After these
exclusions, 55 original articles remained (38 studies
addressed bone-related side effects, and 17 studies
addressed cardiovascular-related side effects). The
2389

Review Article

reference lists from the remaining 55 studies also were
reviewed for any potentially relevant studies that did not
appear in the results of the above PubMed search. From
the reference lists, we identified an additional 4 studies (1
study addressed bone-related side effects, and 3 studies
addressed cardiovascular-related side effects), for a total of
59 studies. Then, we excluded studies that did not have an
adequate comparison group (ADT vs no-ADT groups
among patients with prostate cancer) and studies that had
a total sample size <100. After applying these exclusions,
14 studies remained for the final report (8 studies
addressed bone-related side effects, and 6 studies
addressed cardiovascular-related side effects). For each of
the 14 remaining studies, information on study design,
study size, study setting, length of follow-up or duration
of ADT, specific outcome(s), specific exposure(s), measures of association reported, and covariates/confounders
considered in the final model carefully was abstracted and
included in Tables 1 through 4. Studies were grouped
primarily by major outcomes.

Statistical Analyses
Given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies with
regard to timing and duration of ADT and inconsistent
definitions of outcomes under study, we were unable to
combine the results of all subcategories of studies to
obtain a summary measure of association. However, the
studies with similar methodology in investigating fracture
risk, specific risk of vertebral fracture, and cardiovascularrelated mortality subsequent to ADT treatment were synthesized for summary risk estimates. This was performed
by calculating the natural logarithm of the measure of
association (eg, odds ratio, relative risk [RR], etc) and the
measure’s standard error and then using the meta command in STATA statistical software (version 10.0; StataCorp, College Station, Tex). In 1 instance in which the
original study did not calculate odds ratios of interest, we
were able to calculate crude odds ratios given the number
of exposed and unexposed participants in the study, as
noted in Table 2. Fixed-effects and random-effects models
were computed for each summary estimate. Q tests for
heterogeneity were computed for each fixed-effect estimate. When a significant P value resulted (P < .05), indicating heterogeneity between studies (ie, variability
between studies beyond sampling error), the random2390

effects model estimate was used under the assumption
that any variation between studies beyond sampling error
was random. When the P value from the Q test was not
statistically significant (P > .05), the fixed-effects model
estimate was used under the assumption that the studies
were relatively homogeneous and that any variability was
caused by sampling error. Finally, forest plots were constructed for the individual studies and are depicted in
Figures 1 through 3.

RESULTS
Fracture Risk
The 5 studies that investigated the risk of fracture as major
side effect from ADT are listed in Table 1. Four of the 5
studies were retrospective cohort studies,28-31 and 1 study
was a case-control study that presented data available to
calculate a crude RR.32 All 5 studies reported significantly
increased risks of overall fracture in patients with prostate
cancer who underwent ADT compared with patients who
did not undergo ADT. Although all 5 studies presented
measures of association for overall fractures, Lopez et al28
only reported fractures for peripheral and vertebral fractures. All but 1 of the measures of association were
adjusted for covariates such as age, previous history of
fractures, and comorbidities.32 Three of the 5 studies also
calculated separate measures of association for hip and/or
vertebral fractures (or presented available data to calculate
these estimates). All but 1 of the specific measures of association for hip and/or vertebral fracture were statistically
significant.31 Four of the 5 studies had large sample sizes
(>10,000 total), allowing greater precision of the estimates. The estimates from the studies that summarized
overall fracture risk and vertebral fracture risk are shown
in the forest plots in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
Given the relative homogeneity of outcome for the
fracture-risk studies, we chose to calculate a summary
measure of association and a Q test for heterogeneity in
addition to estimates from individual studies. The results
from the 5 fracture risk studies yielded a summary random-effects estimate of 1.23 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.10-1.38) and a fixed-effects estimate of 1.17 (95%
CI, 1.12-1.23). The Q statistic was 14.80 (P ¼ .005),
indicating significant heterogeneity between studies
beyond sampling error; thus, the random-effects estimate

was a more appropriate estimate. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding the study by Lopez et al,28 and
the random-effects and fixed-effects estimates changed
very little. A summary estimate also was calculated for the
3 studies that reported specific estimates for vertebral fracture; that summary estimate indicated that ADT was associated significantly with an increased risk of vertebral
fracture (fixed-effects estimate, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.60).
The Q statistic indicated that these 3 studies were relatively homogeneous (Q statistic, 3.5; P ¼ .17). However,
it is important to note that the summary estimate for vertebral fractures was based on crude estimates for each individual measure of association.

Osteoporosis and Other
Bone-related Studies
Studies that met our inclusion criteria and that examined
other bone-related outcomes, such as osteoporosis, are
presented in Table 2. All 3 studies reported an increased
risk of osteoporosis or lower bone mineral density (BMD)
among men who underwent ADT compared with men
who did not. Both studies that specifically examined
osteoporosis as an outcome33,34 reported elevated associations between ADT and osteoporosis, but to our knowledge only the study by Morote et al33 indicated that this
association was statistically significant. Because the significant associations between ADT and osteoporosis occurred
only when comparing men who were treated for >6 years,
both the strength and the significance of this association
appear to be functions of the duration of ADT. The study
by Morote et al34 had a mean follow-up of <4 years,
which produced an elevated but not significant measure
of association, supporting the idea that osteoporosis secondary to ADT in men with prostate cancer generally is
not diagnosed until greater than 4 years after the initiation
of ADT. Although osteoporosis secondary to ADT may
not be associated with shorter term regimens of ADT, 1
study indicated that BMD was significantly lower after
<1 year of treatment compared with baseline and compared with men who did not undergo ADT.35 On the basis of the results reported by Greenspan et al,35 we
observed that men who underwent short-term treatment
with ADT endured greater loss of BMD compared with
men who underwent ADT for longer periods. This finding corroborates evidence that bone loss occurs more

Diabetes and Cardiovascular Morbidity
Only 3 studies that met inclusion criteria investigated
incident diabetes and other cardiovascular morbidity secondary to ADT treatment.36-38 All 3 studies reported a
significantly increased risk of diabetes or cardiovascular
morbidity subsequent to the initiation of ADT using retrospective cohort study designs. Participants in the study
by Keating et al36 had a median follow-up of 4.5 years. By
using Cox proportional hazards modeling with adjustment for numerous covariates, those authors observed a
significant hazards ratio [HR] of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.341.55). Lage et al37 followed patients for up to 18 months
after the initiation of ADT and also reported a significant
increase in the risk of diabetes after adjustment for covariates (treatment for 12 months: RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.071.74; treatment for 18 months: RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.121.99). It also is noteworthy that there was a difference in
mean age between the 2 studies at baseline; the population
studied by Keating et al36 was nearly 10 years older on
average than the population studied by Lage et al.37 The
study by Saigal et al38 indicated that men who underwent
ADT had a 20% increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity compared with men who did not undergo ADT.

ADT (HR: 1.1636 and 2.639). Keating et al reported a
more precise and perhaps more generalizable risk estimate
given their large sample size and diverse study population.
However, Tsai et al also included other antiandrogens in
their exposed ADT group, which used a slightly different
outcome definition and adjusted for fewer covariates that
may have resulted in an augmented risk estimate. The 2
randomized clinical trials reported slightly elevated but
nonsignificant increases in cardiovascular-related mortality secondary to ADT. All participants in the study by
Efstathiou et al40 received 4 months of ADT treatment
and then were randomized to receive either no further
treatment or 24 months of adjuvant ADT. Thus, it is possible that the cardiovascular effects for only 4 months of
ADT may be low or negligible. The study by D’Amico
et al41 exclusively investigated fatal myocardial infarction
as an outcome secondary to ADT. The nonsignificant
elevated risk estimate reflects the risk of fatal myocardial
infarction only. Both clinical trials had longer periods of
follow-up than either of the cohort studies but also had
smaller sample numbers, which can influence the precision of risk estimates. Risk estimates from those 4 studies
are illustrated in a forest plot (Fig. 3). In addition to risk
estimates from individual studies, summary statistics also
are provided at the bottom of Figure 3. The fixed-effects
estimate from the results of the 4 studies was 1.17 (95%
CI, 1.07-1.29), and the random-effects estimate was 1.27
(95% CI, 0.98-1.65). The Q statistic from the test of heterogeneity was not significant (P ¼ .084), supporting the
use of the fixed-effects estimate from these relatively
homogeneous studies.

DISCUSSION
For the current report, we systematically reviewed and
quantitatively assessed the literature that examined bonerelated and cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes secondary to ADT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
only study to date that has systematically reviewed the literature on these common and serious side effects from
ADT and that has provided summary risk estimates for
specific outcomes where appropriate. From our analyses,
it appears that individuals with prostate cancer who
undergo ADT have an approximately 23% increase in
2396

overall skeletal fracture risk associated with ADT treatment. Because the studies varied with respect to magnitude of measures of association as well as lengths of
follow-up and specific types of ADT, the magnitude of
the summary estimate can only be an approximate average
estimate. Although the RR of skeletal fracture increases
among men who undergo ADT, it should be noted that
the absolute risk of fracture remains relatively small.30,31
Studies in 2 different populations by Smith et al30,31 indicated that the incidence of overall skeletal fracture in men
with prostate cancer who did not undergo ADT was
approximately 6.5 per 100 person-years. Thus, under an
overall RR of 1.23, the absolute risk of fracture among
ADT-exposed men is only 7.2 per 100 person-years. The
larger studies in the table that looked at GnRH agonists
for ADT produced adjusted risk estimates between 13%
and 22%.29-31 Although the overall risks of fracture varied, all were identified as significant. In addition, both
articles by Smith et al30,31 and the article by Abrahamsen
et al32 reported significant elevations in risk for hip/femoral and/or vertebral fractures. The summary estimate for
vertebral fracture secondary to ADT indicates a significant
40% increase in risk for vertebral fracture for men who
undergo ADT compared with similar men who do not
undergo ADT.
The studies listed in Table 2 reported both significant and nonsignificant increases in BMD loss and osteoporosis. The results obtained by Morote et al33 and the
study by Smith et al30 indicated that duration of ADT is
associated with osteoporosis and fracture risk, with longer
duration of ADT associated with greater risk. Because it
has been demonstrated consistently that the risk of fracture risk is associated with ADT, physicians may consider
preventive therapies for these patients when appropriate,
such as bisphosphonates, supplementary vitamin D, calcium, and a regular regimen of physical activity. Several
studies have indicated that bisphosphonates, such as
pamidronate and zoledronic acid, given to men with prostate cancer who are undergoing ADT significantly
reduced the loss of BMD compared with a placebo group
when measured after 12 months.42-45 Although intravenous administration of bisphosphonates may increase
BMD in patients undergoing ADT, it also has been demonstrated that oral administration of alendronate significantly reduced the loss of BMD45,46 and may be a less
cumbersome method of administration. Limited evidence

exists on bisphosphonate supplementation and the reduction of skeletal fracture incidence. However, 1 study
reported that men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer who received zolendronic acid had a significant annual
reduction in the median time to skeletal-related events,
such as pathologic bone fracture and spinal cord compression, compared with placebo.47
Incident diabetes appears to be a side effect of ADT.
The studies listed in Table 3 by Keating et al36 and Lage
et al37 reported significantly increased risks of incident diabetes between 36% and 49%. This finding is not surprising given the results of previously published literature,
which reported significant elevations of hyperglycemia
and increased insulin resistance in men who underwent
ADT as well as worsened glycemic control in diabetic
men who underwent ADT.24,25,48-50 Furthermore, the
association between ADT and diabetes is plausible biologically given the relation between hypogonadism and
increased insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Given the
role of hyperinsulinemia on prostate cancer cells,25,51,52
Basaria et al proposed that ADT may contribute indirectly
to prostate cancer growth and suggested that the prescription of ‘‘insulin-sensitizing agents’’ may help lower insulin
levels in men who are undergoing ADT.25 However, further research beyond those 2 studies is needed to confirm
the consistency and magnitude of the association.
Results from studies that investigated cardiovascular-related mortality secondary to ADT were relatively
consistent. The summary risk estimate indicated a significantly increased risk in cardiovascular-related mortality of
17%. However, the absolute risk of cardiovascular-related
mortality remained low. Assuming that the baseline risk
for cardiovascular-related mortality among men with
prostate cancer without ADT is between 9 deaths and
10 deaths per 1000 person-years,36 the observed 17%
increase in RR would result in the increase of the absolute
risk to 10.5 deaths and 11.7 deaths per 1000 person-years,
respectively, for men who underwent ADT. Recent
declines in deaths from prostate cancer may be related in
part to competing causes of death among patients with
prostate cancer, and cardiovascular-related mortality
would be on the top of the list.11,25 Therefore, it would be
helpful for physicians to encourage patients with prostate
cancer who are undergoing ADT to make lifestyle modifications (such as physical activity and diet, etc) and to be
vigilant of abnormal lipoprofiles, increased BMI, and

serum levels of insulin. Moreover, baseline morbidity
should be considered when evaluating treatment options
for prostate cancer. A study by D’Amico et al indicated
that men who were randomized to receive radiation therapy had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality
compared with men who received radiation therapy and
ADT.53 It was reported that much of this increase was in
men without any comorbidity or with only minor comorbidities; the increase in all-cause mortality in the radiation
therapy group was not observed among men who had
moderate to severe comorbidities.
Although a few studies included in this review had
large sample sizes, the generalization of the findings still
may be limited. Further research on serious side effects
from ADT would benefit from larger prospective studies
that include different ethnic and age groups (including
men aged <65 years) with longer follow-up when possible. Additional research may be conducted on side effects
outside the focus of this review.
As with evidence of any adverse side effects from
common treatments, a benefit-risk analysis must be considered. Although there is no strong evidence of prolonged survival in men who undergo ADT, this treatment
does provide relief from symptoms. Some patients may
benefit from ADT more than others, and consideration of
the patient’s baseline health status and specific prostate
cancer stage is warranted. Although the absolute risks of
fracture and cardiovascular mortality are low among men
treated with ADT, preventive treatments may reduce further the risk of these serious adverse outcomes related to
ADT.
In conclusion although ADT may alleviate symptoms and potentially prolong survival for patients with
prostate cancer, it is not without side effects that may
lead to serious consequences for a patient’s overall
health and well being. In particular, ADT is associated
with an increased risk of skeletal fracture, incident diabetes, and cardiovascular-related mortality, although
the absolute risk of these events is low. Preventive
measures against these adverse effects as well as careful
assessment of patient’s baseline health status should be
considered.
