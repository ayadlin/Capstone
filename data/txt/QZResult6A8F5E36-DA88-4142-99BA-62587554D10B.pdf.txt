BACKGROUND: Many patients with incurable cancer inaccurately believe that chemotherapy may cure them. Little is known about
how such beliefs affect choices for care at the end of life. This study assessed whether patients with advanced cancer who believed
that chemotherapy might offer a cure were more likely to receive chemotherapy in the last month of life and less likely to enroll in
hospice care before death. METHODS: This study examined patients diagnosed with stage IV lung or colorectal cancer in the Cancer
Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance consortium, a population- and health system–based prospective cohort study. Among 722
patients who completed a baseline survey and died during the study period, logistic regression was used to assess the association of
understanding goals of chemotherapy with chemotherapy use in the last month of life and hospice enrollment before death; adjustments were made for patient and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: One-third of the patients (33%) recognized that chemotherapy
was “not at all” likely to cure their cancer. After adjustments, such patients were no less likely than other patients to receive end-oflife chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-2.09), but they were more likely than other patients to
enroll in hospice (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.37-2.82). CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of the purpose of chemotherapy for incurable cancer
is a critical aspect of informed consent. Still, advanced cancer patients who were well informed about chemotherapy’s goals received
late-life chemotherapy at rates similar to those for other patients. An understanding of the incurable nature of cancer, however, is
associated with increased hospice enrollment before death, and this suggests important care outcomes beyond chemotherapy use.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer patients should have the opportunity to make choices for care that incorporate both realistic expectations for the
outcomes of therapy and personal values and goals; these principles have been affirmed in recent guidelines.1 However,
Weeks et al2 recently demonstrated that most patients with incurable lung and colorectal cancer inaccurately believe that
chemotherapy could be curative. This work raised concerns about the adequacy of informed consent for chemotherapy
among such patients, who may experience palliation or life prolongation as a result of chemotherapy, but not a cure.
These findings emerged in a broader context of work suggesting that decision making for patients with advanced
cancer can be problematic. Many patients have a limited understanding of their prognosis3,4 and have discussions about
end-of-life care late or not at all.5,6 Perhaps as a result, aggressive end-of-life care is prevalent and on the rise.7,8
The patients studied by Weeks et al2 had already chosen to use initial chemotherapy for their metastatic cancers, and
we do not know whether more realistic expectations would have changed their initial choices. However, because of their
incurable disease, more choices lay ahead for these patients, especially about the care they wished to receive at the end of
life. Using follow-up data on the medical care of patients in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study, we assessed the extent to which early perceptions about whether chemotherapy might be curative were

associated with care received by patients with metastatic
lung and colorectal cancer at the end of life, including
chemotherapy use near death and hospice enrollment. We
also evaluated the extent to which patient preferences for
symptom-directed or life-prolonging care were associated
with end-of-life care choices.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The CanCORS study enrolled approximately 10,000
patients with lung or colorectal cancer diagnosed between
2003 and 2005. Patients were enrolled from 5 geographic
regions (Northern California, Los Angeles County, North
Carolina, Iowa, and Alabama), 5 participating health
maintenance organizations, and 15 Veterans Affairs medical centers.9,10 Each site identified incident cases with a
comprehensive, rapid case ascertainment protocol using
either population-based or institutional cancer registries.
The study was approved by the human subjects committees at all participating institutions.
Patients (or surrogates of patients who were deceased
or too ill to participate) were interviewed at the baseline,
approximately 4 to 6 months after their diagnosis, in English, Spanish, or Chinese. Medical records were abstracted
for the time period beginning 3 months before the diagnosis. Medical record abstraction was performed in 2 phases;
abstraction under the original CanCORS protocol was performed through 15 months or to death for those who died
sooner. For patients surviving beyond 15 months, additional medical record abstraction was conducted subsequently under the CanCORS II protocol. The date of last
abstraction under CanCORS II varied slightly by site; the
earliest completion date at any site was October 2010. Both
rounds of data collection assessed chemotherapy use within
the last 30 days of life and hospice enrollment.
For this analysis, we focused on patients with lung
and colorectal cancer who had stage IV cancer at the time
of the initial diagnosis (n 5 2671), were living at the time
of the baseline survey administration with a survey completed by the patient or a surrogate (n 5 1333), reported
having had a discussion with a physician about chemotherapy and answered questions about whether chemotherapy might be curative and about care preferences
(n 5 1189), had medical records available for abstraction
(n 5 946), and died within the medical record abstraction
period. The final cohort included 722 patients: 477 with
lung cancer and 245 with colorectal cancer.
Outcomes included receipt of chemotherapy within
the last month (30 days) of life and any hospice utilization; this was determined from medical record
abstraction.

Additional variables of interest included survey data
on perceptions about whether chemotherapy might be curative; these were elicited with the following question:
“After talking with your doctors about chemotherapy,
how likely did you think it was that chemotherapy would
cure your cancer?”2,11 The response options were “very
likely,” “somewhat likely,” “a little likely,” “not at all likely,” and “don’t know.” Patient preferences for care were
ascertained with the following question: “If you had to
make a choice now, would you prefer treatment that
extends life as much as possible, even if it means having
more pain and discomfort, or would you want treatment
that focuses on relieving pain and discomfort as much as
possible, even if it means not living as long?”3 Five questions modified from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey were used to assess
patients’ perceptions of patient-physician communication.2,12,13 Score means were transformed into a 0 to 100
scale. Surveys also assessed sex, race/ethnicity, age, marital
status, education, number of months able to live at their
current standard if their income were lost, performance
status (based on the EQ-5D, with performance status
defined as “good” for patients with no mobility problems,
no self-care problems, and no or some problems with their
usual activities14), and comorbidity (adapted from the
self-administered Charlson index and the comorbidity
questions from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes
Study15,16). Additional data from medical record abstraction included vital status, date of death, and insurance
type.
Statistical Analyses

Descriptive analyses included the prevalence of outcomes
(chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life and hospice use)
according to the presence of independent variables (eg,
sex and race/ethnicity). Multivariate analyses were conducted with logistic regression on the outcomes of chemotherapy use in the last 30 days of life and hospice use.
Variables were included in analyses based on a priori
hypotheses about possible influences on end-of-life treatment choices, including sociodemographic variables (sex,
race/ethnicity, marital status, age, education, wealth, insurance, and membership in an integrated provider network); health attributes (comorbidity, performance
status, cancer type, and length of survival from diagnosis
to death); our independent variables of interest (an understanding of whether chemotherapy might be curative and
preferences for care); and physician communication ratings, which were previously shown to be negatively associated with an understanding of the purpose of

chemotherapy.2 All variables were retained in multivariate
models, regardless of their statistical significance.
Perceptions about whether chemotherapy might be
curative were categorized as accurate if the patient or surrogate responded that chemotherapy was “not at all likely”
to cure. After the main analyses, we also evaluated the
effect of expanding our definition of accurate expectations
about chemotherapy: we first examined the effect of considering a response of “don’t know” or refusal as accurate,
and we second considered only responses of “very likely”
to cure as inaccurate.
Because of item nonresponse, a multiply imputed
data set was created with standard statistical methods.17,18
Imputed values were used for covariates in bivariate and
multivariate analyses but not for chemotherapy use or
hospice care and not for perceptions about chemotherapy
or care preferences, for which no data were missing on the
basis of the cohort selection. Statistical analyses were conducted with Stata 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX.)
RESULTS
This cohort of stage IV lung or colorectal cancer patients
who were alive 4 to 6 months after their diagnosis but
died during follow-up survived a median of 13 months
between diagnosis and death (Table 1). Physician communication scores were generally favorable, with 51% of
patients offering the highest possible rating. Only 33% of
the patients recognized that chemotherapy was “not at all”
likely to cure their cancer. Care preferences at the baseline
were divided between preferences for life-prolonging care
(44%) and symptom-directed care (43%); 13% of the
patients did not state a preference.
Overall, 128 patients (18%) received chemotherapy
in the last month of life; they included 21.7% of those
who recognized that chemotherapy was not at all likely to
cure their cancer and 15.8% of those who did not. In
adjusted analyses assessing factors associated with chemotherapy use in the last month of life, patients who recognized that chemotherapy was not at all likely to cure them
were no less likely to receive end-of-life chemotherapy
(odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.84-2.09; P 5 .23) than those who believed that chemotherapy offered some possibility of cure (Table 2). A preference for symptom-directed care over life-prolonging
care was also not associated with receipt of end-of-life
chemotherapy (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.44-1.14; P 5 .15).
Nonwhite patients were less likely than white patients to
use late chemotherapy (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30-0.90;
P 5 .02; Table 2), as were patients who lived longer after

Overall, 255 patients (35%) enrolled in hospice
before death. Nearly half (49.2%) of the patients who recognized that chemotherapy was not at all likely to cure
their cancer enrolled in hospice before death, whereas
28.4% of those who held inaccurate expectations about
chemotherapy did. In adjusted analyses, patients who recognized that chemotherapy was not at all likely to cure
their cancer were more likely to enroll in hospice (OR,
1.97; 95% CI, 1.37-2.82, P < .001), as were those who
preferred symptom-directed care versus life-prolonging
care (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.26-2.66; P 5 .002.) Nonwhite
patients were less likely than white patients to enroll in
hospice (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90; P 5 .02; Table
3.) Patients who were 80 versus <60 years old (OR,

cancer versus colorectal cancer (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.403.09; P < .001) had higher rates of hospice use, whereas
patients who lived longer after their diagnosis were less
likely to use hospice before death (OR, 0.99 per month of
survival from diagnosis; 95% CI, 0.98-0.995; P 5 .001).
In sensitivity analyses that expanded our definition
of accurate expectations about whether chemotherapy
might be curative, results of multivariate models were similar, with accurate expectations associated with hospice
use but not with end-of-life chemotherapy (results not
shown).
DISCUSSION
Previous work by Weeks et al2 demonstrated that most
patients with metastatic lung and colorectal cancer do not
know that chemotherapy will not cure them. This work
raised concerns about the adequacy of fully informed decision making for cancer treatment among patients with

that chemotherapy might cure them make different
choices about care near death.

was not a function of baseline expectations that chemotherapy might be curative. Instead, although overall use of
late-life chemotherapy in our cohort was relatively low
(18%), patients who recognized that chemotherapy would
not cure them were no less likely to use chemotherapy
near death. (In fact, their absolute odds of chemotherapy
use were higher, although not statistically so.) In addition,
late chemotherapy use was not associated with care preferences; those who wanted care directed at comfort were
just as likely to receive chemotherapy near death as
patients who preferred life-prolonging care, although our
study was underpowered to detect small differences in the
use of late chemotherapy.
On the other hand, patients who recognized that
chemotherapy was not curative were more likely to enter
hospice, as were patients who preferred comfort-directed
care. Previous work has shown that recognition of a poor
prognosis is associated with less aggressive care at the end
of life,3 and end-of-life discussions are associated with
more and earlier hospice use.5,19 Thus, it seems reasonable
that patients who recognize that chemotherapy will not
cure them may similarly wish to receive hospice care,
which is considered a marker of high quality end-of-life
care20,21 and is associated with better quality of life near
death.5,22,23 Hospice enrollment may, therefore, be an
important outcome of realistic expectations about chemotherapy, even if late-life chemotherapy use is not affected.
Is it counterintuitive that chemotherapy use at the
end of life would not reflect an understanding of its efficacy or care preferences? Only if we assume that chemotherapy would be chosen for a single purpose—to cure—
and not to palliate. Although end-of-life chemotherapy
use was relatively infrequent, many of those who used it in
1895

Original Article

the last month of life were aware that it would not cure
them, and they wished to receive care focused on alleviating symptoms. The increasing use of targeted therapy may
make chemotherapy more tolerable and, therefore, more
appealing to patients who want to avoid highly toxic regimens. Although late-life use of chemotherapy is often
considered a marker of aggressive care, our findings suggest that at least some users of chemotherapy at the end of
life have other goals, including palliation.
We should not minimize the potential impact of latelife chemotherapy on patients, who may experience side
effects without benefit, or on the health care system, where
late-life interventions may drive up the cost of care. Our
study cannot tell us whether end-of-life chemotherapy
achieved palliative goals for the patients, and previous literature suggests that end-of-life chemotherapy is associated
with the use of other measures of aggressive end-of-life
care.24 Notably, Greer et al25 have found that early integration of palliative care is associated with decreased use of intravenous chemotherapy, but not oral chemotherapy, at the
end of life. Taken together, their work and ours suggest
that not all late-life chemotherapy is the same, and decision
making about chemotherapy is complex and is not purely
based on hopes for a cure. This area deserves more study, as
does the framing of such conversations by physicians.
In addition, as we have noted, chemotherapy use
late in life was relatively infrequent among all patients,
not just among those who recognized early in the course
of the disease that it would not cure them. Even though
many patients had hopes of a cure soon after their diagnosis, many may have reached more realistic expectations
over time and decided to forgo treatment as a result.
Nonetheless, even some well-informed patients may
choose to receive chemotherapy until the end of life.
Other findings deserve special mention. Nonwhite
patients were less likely to use hospice than whites, and this
finding is consistent with prior work suggesting greater use
of aggressive measures and lower hospice use among minorities.26-28 However, nonwhite patients were also less likely
to use late-life chemotherapy; further study of this issue
would be useful. In addition, despite the possibility that different incentives or provider practice types could influence
late-life care utilization, we found no relationship between
either chemotherapy use or hospice and insurance type or
enrollment in an integrated provider network.
Our findings should be considered in light of limitations. Notably, patient reports about expectations for
chemotherapy and care preferences were typically ascertained 4 to 6 months after diagnosis. Patient expectations
and goals of care, however, can be dynamic. It is possible
1896

that end-of-life chemotherapy use would be more closely
tied to expectations and preferences if they were assessed
in the last month of life. However, changing goals and
expectations may be more likely to shift toward palliative
goals and expectations than away from them,29 and it,
therefore, seems unlikely that patients who recognized
early that chemotherapy would not cure them would then
develop more optimistic beliefs as they approached death.
If anything, we may have underestimated the number of
patients who reached an understanding near the end of
life that treatment was not curative. Also, our cohort
included patients with advanced cancer who lived at least
4 to 6 months (and thus participated in the baseline survey) and discussed chemotherapy with a physician; the
patients also had a relatively poor performance status. We
cannot be certain whether our findings can be generalized
to patients who die soon after diagnosis. Notably, hospice
utilization was lower in our cohort of longer surviving
patients, but rates of end-of-life chemotherapy use were
similar to those that we reported among all CanCORS
decedents with stage IV cancer.19 In addition, we focused
this analysis on patient beliefs that chemotherapy might
be curative. Because most patients believed that chemotherapy might be curative, we felt that it was important to
understand the outcomes of such beliefs. However, future
work might be enriched by an understanding of the full
spectrum of goals of chemotherapy, including life prolongation and/or palliation of symptoms. Finally, our study
was subject to a nonresponse bias; however, other evidence has found the CanCORS cohort to be representative of patients diagnosed with lung and colorectal cancer
in the United States.30
Despite high rates of early beliefs that chemotherapy
may be curative, even some patients who recognized that
chemotherapy would not cure them received chemotherapy in the last month of life. One possible explanation is
that, at least for some patients, late chemotherapy use may
be an informed decision based on realistic expectations
that it will not be curative. However, conversations about
the incurable nature of the disease are associated with
higher rates of hospice utilization, and this suggests that
informed decisions about the goals of chemotherapy can
have a broader impact on care, well beyond initial decisions about treatment.
