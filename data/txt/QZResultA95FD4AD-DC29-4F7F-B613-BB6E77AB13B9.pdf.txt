ABSTRACT
We have used a perfusion bellows cell culture system to investigate resveratrolinduced anti-proliferation/apoptosis in a human estrogen receptor (ER)-negative
breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). Using an injection system to perfuse media
with stilbene, we showed resveratrol (0.5 – 100 μM) to decrease cell proliferation in a
concentration-dependent manner. Comparison of influx and medium efflux resveratrol
concentrations revealed rapid disappearance of the stilbene, consistent with cell
uptake and metabolism of the agent reported by others. Exposure of cells to 10 μM
resveratrol for 4 h daily × 6 d inhibited cell proliferation by more than 60%. Variable
extracellular acid-alkaline conditions (pH 6.8 – 8.6) affected basal cell proliferation
rate, but did not alter anti-proliferation induced by resveratrol. Resveratrol-induced
gene expression, including transcription of the most up-regulated genes and proapoptotic p53-dependent genes, was not affected by culture pH changes. The
microarray findings in the context of induction of anti-proliferation with brief daily
exposure of cells to resveratrol—and rapid disappearance of the compound in the
perfusion system—are consistent with existence of an accessible initiation site for
resveratrol actions on tumor cells, e.g., the cell surface receptor for resveratrol
described on integrin αvβ3.

These cellular actions may reflect a reduction in
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
mitochondrial trans-membrane potential Δ ψm, as well as
reduced phosphorylation of mTOR, RP-S6 and 4EBP1 [2].
In addition, the compound is also reported to have

RESULTS

anti-inflammatory, anti-leukemic, neuroprotective and
antiviral properties [3–5]. A cell surface receptor for
the stilbene has been identified on integrin αvβ3 and
has been shown to be linked to activation of the MAPK
signal transduction pathway [6]. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
recognition site on the integrin blocks actions of the
stilbene, indicating proximity of the resveratrol receptor to
the RGD site [6, 7]. The mechanisms of anti-tumor effects
of resveratrol are incompletely understood, but an end result
in a variety of tumor cell models of resveratrol treatment is
apoptosis [8–10].
Other beneficial effects attributed to resveratrol
relate to aging, e.g., cataract and bone mass loss,
and to neurodegeneration, obesity and diabetes [11].
Resveratrol induces expression of multiple genes
and confers metabolic changes that mimic caloric
restriction, a state which promotes longevity across
species [12]. These benefits appear to be dependent
upon sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase.
How resveratrol activates SIRT1 protein is not entirely
clear, but the binding of lamin A by SIRT1 induces an
allosteric change in SIRT1 that exposes its deacetylase
site to native substrates [11]. Modulation of SIRT1
activity is also dependent on physiological substrate
sequence and these substrates may contribute to actions
of resveratrol [13].
The pharmacokinetics of resveratrol have been
studied in pre-clinical models and human subjects [14, 15]
and appear unfavorable for application to clinical disease
states [14]. The systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is
poor, as is the case with many polyphenols. Studies in
mice, rats and dogs consistently suggest that resveratrol is
well-absorbed, but is avidly glucuronidated and sulfated
in both liver and intestinal epithelial cells [16, 17]. Studies
in human subjects also indicate poor bioavailability of
unmodified resveratrol [18, 19]. Resveratrol has a very
short half-life in the systemic circulation.
In the current studies, we have examined the anticancer properties of resveratrol in chemotherapy-resistant
human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, using an
in vitro perfused cell model in which concentrations of
the agent and durations of exposure to the agent can be
critically adjusted. Ambient pH and medium composition
are also readily manipulated and are important to tumor
cell function [20]. Resistance of cancers to therapy can
involve both biochemical and microenvironmental factors.
Studies here include effects on resveratrol’s activity
of factors such as environmental pH of tumor cells,
duration of cell exposure to resveratrol, and effectiveness
of drug concentrations in terms of anti-proliferation.
The microarray and real-time PCR studies are focused
on genes whose expression is highly upregulated by
resveratrol (such as NLRP1, CASP2, LSM4 and SLC12A4)
and genes that support apoptosis, e.g., BAD, p53, TP53I3,
p21, c-fos and COX-2.

Effect of time of exposure on resveratrol-induced
signal transduction, gene expression and
anti-proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells
Resveratrol has limited bioavailability, which has
caused concern about its biological activity. Cellular
uptake and metabolism of resveratrol is rapid [21]. To
determine the minimum incubation time for resveratrolactivated signal transduction and anti-proliferation, MDAMB-231 cells were treated with 10 μM resveratrol for
0.5 − 4 h prior to harvest. Exposure of cells for 0.5 h to
resveratrol importantly activated ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A). To
determine the duration of resveratrol-induced ERK1/2
activation after removal of the stilbene, we treated cells
with resveratrol for 0.5 − 4 h, then removed the agent at
specific time points. Cells were then washed twice with
fresh medium before they were re-fed with medium for
the remainder of the time prior to harvest. The activation
of ERK1/2 exposed to resveratrol for 0.5 h did not decay
as compared to that in the 4 h exposed cells (Fig. 1B).
The effect of duration of incubation with resveratrol
on drug-modulated gene expression was determined by
incubating cells with resveratrol for either 1 h or 6 h.
The resveratrol was then removed and cells were washed
twice with fresh medium and re-fed with fresh medium
for another 5 h. There was no significant difference
in resveratrol-upregulared and -downregulated gene
expression with exposure to 10 μM resveratrol for 6 h
and 1 h (Fig. 1C). When MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with 10 μM resveratrol for short periods of time (0.5 to
4 h) daily for 6 d, we found that exposure to the drug for
4 h reduced cell counts by more than 60%, compared
to untreated control cells (1.28 × 106 ± 3.46 × 105
[resveratrol] vs. 4.03 × 106 ± 3.29 × 105 [control]). On the
other hand, exposure of cells to 10 μM resveratrol for 24 h
daily for 6 d caused 80% reduction in cell counts (7.72 ×
105 ± 5.44 × 104) compared to untreated control (Fig. 1D).
The full-term exposure to resveratrol increased only 20%
more in anti-proliferative effect than those treated with 4 h
daily. Those results suggest that short-term exposure to
resveratrol is sufficient to induce cellular activities such
as gene expression and anti-proliferation.

Effect of acid-alkaline culture conditions on
resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in
MDA-MB-231 cells
It has been reported that the acidic condition
of tumor microenvironment affects the efficacy of
chemotherapy [20]. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
media with pHs of 6.8, 7.4, 7.5 and 8.6. Cell proliferation
in the absence of resveratrol (10 μM) was significantly
affected by pH culture condition, but the anti-proliferation

containing 10% FBS after 24 h and refreshed daily
thereafter. Cells were counted to confirm the numbers of
cells initially attached to flakes. Resveratrol concentration
in the medium was constant throughout each experiment
and the resveratrol concentrations tested were 0.01 μM to
10 μM. An anti-proliferative effect of resveratrol was not
detectable on cell counts at 2 d (Fig. 4A), regardless of
stilbene concentration (up to 10 μM). Anti-proliferation
was apparent by 4 d of treatment, at which time resveratrol
caused a 1.3 to 20-fold (1.59 × 108 ± 2.03 × 107 to 1.01
× 107 ± 2.75 × 105) decrease in treated cells compared
to unexposed control cells (2.02 × 108 ± 2.36 × 107).
The resveratrol effect was concentration-dependent
(Fig. 4A). In a second protocol, cells were exposed to
10% FBS-containing DMEM and treated with different
concentrations of resveratrol (0.1 to 10 μM) daily for
8 d. Cells were then harvested from the perfusion bottles
and counted. There were significantly different growth
patterns of control cell cultures between perfusion and
non-perfusion cell culture systems in extending the culture
condition (Fig. 4B).
Because short-term exposure to resveratrol
induced anti-proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
1D), we determined whether short-term exposure to
resveratrol induced anti-proliferation of cancer cells
in the perfusion bellows cell culture system. MDAMB-231 cells were cultured in cell culture system as
described above. Different concentrations of resveratrol
were injected into perfusion bellows bottles over a
1 h period and incubation continued for another 23 h
without resveratrol in influx medium. We determined the
concentrations of resveratrol harvested from perfusion
bellows bottle by LCMS/MS. Media were harvested at
various time points. The concentration of resveratrol
in efflux tubes from bellows cell culture was far below
the influx tube in the range between 0.5 μM to 100 μM
(Fig. 4C). However, the concentrations of resveratrol in
efflux tubes of the 50 μM and 100 μM input resveratrol
concentrations followed the expected patterns (Fig. 4C).
These results confirm previous reports that the turnover
rate of resveratrol inside the cells is rapid. Interestingly,
the results of 50 μM and 100 μM resveratrol experiments
also suggest that resveratrol may not need to enter
cells  to induce apoptosis. For the anti-proliferation
studies, the short-term 1 h-injection of resveratrol
procedures were repeated for 6 d. Results presented in
Fig. 4D indicate that although cells were exposed to
resveratrol for a short period of time, resveratrol induced
­anti-proliferation.
In order to determine the effect of resveratrolinduced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, cells were
treated with different concentration of resveratrol for
24 h. Cells were harvested and flow cytometry was
conducted. Resveratrol increased the fraction of cells in
S phase from 15.80 ± 2.97% in control to 27.85 ± 4.74%
at the 48  h time point in a concentration-dependent

Microarray gene profiles in resveratrol-treated
MDA-MB-231 cells
MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to 10 μM
resveratrol for 6 h. Microarray experiments were conducted
as described in the Materials and Methods and identified
25 highly up-regulated genes (≥6-fold increase in mRNA
abundance) as major gene targets for resveratrol (Fig. 3A).
The second most up-regulated mRNA with resveratrol
treatment was encoded by the NALP1 gene, also known
as NLRP1 and DEFCAP, an essential component of the
inflammasome and known to play an important role in
innate immunity. Recent hallmark reports clarify the role
of this gene in caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β
production and in inflammasome assembly and function
demonstrating that NALP1 is a direct sensor of bacterial
components in host defense against pathogens [22]. The
third most highly up-regulated mRNA was encoded by
the CASP2 (caspase 2) gene, a well-known apoptosis
regulatory protein. It has been demonstrated by using
in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments that NALP1
(DEFCAP) protein is capable of strongly interacting with
caspase-2, and transient overexpression of full-length
DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma
cells MCF-7 resulted in significant levels of apoptosis
[23]. Other up-regulated genes, such as LSM4, which is
involved in RNA processing, may function in a chaperonelike manner [24]. SLC12A4 (human potassium chloride
cotransporter 1) is activated by cell swelling and may
be associated with apoptosis [25, 26]. These results
convey the anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties
of the stilbene. In order to further investigate whether
environmental conditions affect the expression of those
up-regulated genes induced by resveratrol, expression of
NALP1, CASP2, SLC12A4 and LSM4 was studied.
MDA-MB-231 cells grown in different pH
conditions were treated with 10 μM resveratrol for 6 h and
total RNA was harvested for real-time PCR. Expression
of NALP1, CASP2, SLC12A4 and LSM4 mRNAs were
induced significantly under various conditions (Fig. 3B).
We also studied pro-apoptotic protein abundance in
resveratrol-treated cells harvested from the perfusion
bellows system and demonstrated activation of several proapoptotic genes (Fig. 3C). Thus, resveratrol-induced gene
expression and chemical/cellular activity are minimally
affected by changes in the cancer microenvironment.

manner  (Fig. 5A). Cells in G1 and G2/M phases were
slightly decreased after resveratrol treatment indicating
that resveratrol may induce S phase growth arrest
in MDA-MB-231 cells. Resveratrol also induced
apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
5A and B), which may result from modulation of cell
cycle progression. Resveratrol inhibited MDA-MB-231
cell proliferation and increased the fraction of cells
in sub-G1 by 23.45 ± 4.74%, compared to untreated
control. Furthermore, the effects of resveratrol on cyclin
B1, CDK1, caspase 3, and PARP1 were also addressed.
Results indicated that 10 μM resveratrol significantly
inhibited cyclin B1 expression, decreased the content of
caspase 3, and activated PARP1 (Fig. 5C).

cells by inhibiting cell-cycle progression [28,  31–33].
Kuwajerwala et al. have reported that treatment of prostate
LNCaP cells with resveratrol causes cells to enter into
S phase [34]. This complex of properties of the stilbene
may all contribute to its anti-proliferative effects.
Resveratrol in a number of studies has been shown
to have low bioavailability. Preclinical studies have
shown no correlation between the bioavailability of free
resveratrol and its chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic
efficacy. The IC50 values for inhibition of cell growth by
resveratrol have been reported to be in the range of 5 to
10 μM in preclinical models [5, 6]. Our studies indicate,
in contrast, that at concentrations as low as 0.1 μM,
resveratrol induced more than a 50% decrease in cancer
cell numbers compared to control after day 6 (Fig. 4B).
Certain aberrancies were detected, e.g., results at 0.1 μM
resveratrol. We know that low concentrations of the
stilbene have been shown to inhibit apoptosis [7] and
that resveratrol is an ERα partial agonist [35]. In such
studies, the possibility exists that low concentrations
of resveratrol stimulated cell proliferation, e.g., up to
2–3 d, before the anti-proliferative action of the agent
predominated. At low physiologic serum concentrations
that are normally achieved by nutritional intake,
phytoestrogens are likely to act through modulation
of estrogen signaling. However, these lower serum
concentrations appear insufficient to inhibit tyrosine
kinases or other enzymes that may provide alternative
targets of phytoestrogen effects [36].
The para-hydroxy group of trans-resveratrol is more
reactive than its meta-hydroxy groups in neutral and acidic
solutions; the reactivity of meta-hydroxy groups increases
under alkaline conditions. Therefore, trans-resveratrol
effectively scavenges free radicals over a wide pH range
[37]. In this study, we chose acid, neutral and basic
pH conditions that might be achieved in the tumor cell
microenvironment in vivo. The acidic microenvironment
around tumor cells may contribute to chemoresistance
of cancer cells and alkalinity supports chemosensitivity.
Resveratrol decreases Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) activity
by several mechanisms, promoting an increase in pHe and
a decrease in pHi [38, 39]. One of the present co-authors
and his colleagues have shown in studies of NHE1 that
the intracellular buffering capacity of cells is up to 1.2
pH units [40] and we extrapolated to the extracellular
microenvironment to obtain the pH 8.6 value with a
presumed decrease in NHE1 activity attributable to
resveratrol.
Using cDNA microarray (Fig. 3) and qPCR, we
demonstrated alterations in the expression of genes
associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as a result of
resveratrol treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells under various
culture conditions. In the current study, transcription of
p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes including p53, c-fos,
c-jun, p21(waf1/Cip1), PIG3 and BAD was induced by
resveratrol (Fig. 3C). In our earlier studies with human

DISCUSSION
This study investigated effects of resveratrolinduced anti-proliferation in triple-negative MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells, but the results shown may
be applicable to other cancer cells. Included were studies
of changes in the cell microenvironment to determine
whether such changes altered drug activity.
When low concentrations of resveratrol were used in
the current studies, the efflux concentrations of resveratrol
were far below the projected concentrations (Fig. 4C); this
is consistent with the short biological half-life of the agent
described by others [27]. Studies have indicated that
resveratrol in double-distilled water is stable for up to
8 h; on the other hand, resveratrol in incubation medium
containing 10% FBS decays after 2–3 h and only 10%
of the activity persists at 8 h at 37°C (HY Lin et al.,
unpublished observation). Our earlier description of a
receptor for resveratrol on integrin αvβ3 [6] on the cancer
cell surface raised the possibility investigated here that
rapid cellular uptake and metabolism of the stilbene need
not be relevant to the pro-apoptotic activity that can be
initiated by extracellular resveratrol.
Resveratrol (10 μM) reduced the percentage of
proliferating cells to 33% of the control levels after 48 h
in perfusion bellows culture system (Fig. 4B). Resveratrol
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in human
epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells in a dose- and timedependent manner which was associated with a reduced
level of expression of cyclins D1, D2 and E2. Also reduced
were levels of CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, but levels of
Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 proteins were increased [28].
Wolter et al. have shown down-regulation of the cyclin
D1/CDK4 complex by resveratrol in colon cancer cell
lines [29]. Benitez et al. observed that treatment of LNCaP
and PC-3 cells with resveratrol induces apoptosis and that
this is associated with the reduced levels of expression
of cyclins D1 and E and CDK4, as well as a reduction
in cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase activity [30]. Several reports
indicate that resveratrol inhibits proliferation of cancer

thyroid cancer cells, we found a remarkable increase in
the level of p53 mRNA and protein, in conjunction with
an increase in the level of p21 (Waf1/Cip1), after exposure
to resveratrol [41]. Studies from other groups indicate that
resveratrol decreases expression of genes that support
proliferation [42]. Thus, resveratrol induces apoptosis by
activating p53 signaling mechanisms [43] and by causing
transcription of a number of genes linked to apoptosis.
Certainly, more than one pro-apoptotic mechanism is
involved in the actions of resveratrol on tumor cells.
In this regard, activation of Apaf-1, a novel protein
induced by resveratrol, has been reported to participate
in the cytochrome-C-dependent activation of caspase
3, which triggers a cascade of events in apoptosis [23].
Studies of Narayanan et al. have shown that treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with resveratrol
induces expression and activation of p300 and p53 [35].
This appears to be relevant to earlier studies of ours that
showed induction by resveratrol of acetylation of the
carboxyl terminus of p53 [44]; this increases the level of
sequence-specific DNA binding of p53.
In summary, using a perfusion bellows culture
system, we have studied the effects of drug exposure
duration and acid-alkaline conditions on resveratrolinduced anti-proliferation in triple-negative breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 cells. The results of microarray, qPCR
and biological end-points confirm that resveratrolinduced anti-proliferation in cancer cells is not affected
by environmental pH. More importantly, recurrent shortterm incubation of tumor cells with resveratrol are shown

from BCRC and passaged it in our laboratory for fewer
than 6 months after thrown and maintained for further
study in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM,
Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
supplemented with 10% FBS and incubation conditions
were 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
In LC/MS/MS experiments, samples (20 μL) were
injected onto an HP 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a
narrow-bore column Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 (5 μm,
150 × 2.1 mm; Agilent Technologies). Separation was
performed using a mobile phase of 0.1% (v/v) acetic
acid (A) and 100% acetonitrile (B), with a linear gradient
of 20–60% B over 25 min. Flow rate was maintained
at 0.2 ml/min and elution was monitored by a diode
array detector (200–600 nm). The LC effluent was then
introduced into a turbo ion-spray source on a Q/STAR-XL
quadrupole/time-of-flight (TOF) hybrid mass spectrometer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Negative
ESI mass spectra were acquired over the range from m/z
100 to 400. The electrospray voltage was set at –4.5 kV
and the source temperature was maintained at 475°C. CID
spectra were acquired using nitrogen as the collision gas
under collision energies of 25–55 V. High purity nitrogen
gas (99.995%) was used as nebulizer, curtain, and heater
and collision gas source.

Study of pharmacodynamics of resveratrol
The bellows perfusion cell culture system we
developed is a disposable bioreactor capable of high density
cell culture for studies of anti-cancer drug [45]. Five × 107
cells were seeded on polymer flakes in either non-perfusion
or perfusion bellows cell modes and incubated at 37°C
overnight. Flakes were harvested, trypsinized and cells
were collected. Cell numbers were counted. The numbers
of original cells attached to flakes were 0.5 × 107 cells/
bottle. Cell cultures were refreshed with 10% stripped FBScontaining medium. Resveratrol was added in the medium
bottle to the final concentrations indicated.

TUNEL Assay

Western blot

MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 100-mm
tissue culture dishes until 80% confluent, treated with
resveratrol in the concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 5 and
10 μM for 24 h. Apoptotic cells were detected by the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) staining using the fluorescence
method with the APO-BrdU TUNEL assay kit (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Following the
TUNEL procedure, cells were immediately analyzed by
flow cytometry. The percentage of apoptotic positive cells
was performed with ModFit LT software. Experiments
were carried out independently at least twice.

To examine the signaling pathway of resveratrol
induced anti-proliferation, we performed western blot
analyses to quantify the protein expression levels in
the total cell lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells that were
treated with 10 μM resveratrol in different time or pH
conditions. Protein samples were resolved on a 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. A 20-μg
quantity of protein was loaded in each well with 5x
sample buffer, and the protein samples were resolved by
electrophoresis at 100 V for 2 h. The resolved proteins
were transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to Millipore
Immobilon-PSQ Transfer PVDF membranes (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) with the Trans-Blot® SD Semi-Dry
Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA,
USA). The membranes were blocked with a solution
of 2% fetal bovine serum in Tris-buffered saline. The
membranes were incubated with primary antibodies

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were harvested from polymer flakes by
trypsinization, washed with PBS and were resuspended in
200 μL PBS (1 × 105 -1 × 106 cells). To quantify cellular
DNA content, cells were permeabilized by fixation with
12904

Oncotarget

70% ethanol for 30 min at 4°C. Samples were stored in 70%
ethanol at −20°C for up to several weeks prior to propidium
iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometric analysis. If cellular
DNA quantification needed to be performed on the same
day, cells after permeabilation were washed in PBS and
resuspended in 500 μL of PBS. DNase-free RNase (2.5 μL)
was added to the cell suspension and incubation carried out
at 37°C for 1 h; cells were then collected and maintained in
the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Flow cytometry
was carried out on a FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson)
instrument, using CellQuest software to determine DNA
content. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis used Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide.
The relative percentages of cells in G1, S, or G2/M phase
were calculated from FL-2 histograms using ModFit LT
software.

Microarray
After a 6-h treatment with 10 μM resveratrol,
cells were collected by trypsinization and total RNA
was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Amount
and quality of the RNA fractions were evaluated by UV
spectrophotometry (260 and 280 nm wavelength) followed
by examination of the probes by capillary electrophoresis
on Agilent Bioanalyzers. GeneChip expression and IVT
(in vitro transcription) labeling kits (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) were used for the synthesis of cDNA
and complementary RNA respectively. Biotin-labeled
RNA was fragmented and hybridized on human genome
U133 plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. After hybridization
(16 h), the microarrays were processed by automated
washing on the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.
Staining of  the  hybridized probes was performed with
fluorescent streptavidin–phycoerythrin conjugates (1 mg/
ml; Invitrogen). The scanning of DNA microarrays was
carried out on an Affymetrix laser instrument. Microarray
quality assessment, condensing of the probe sets, data
normalization, and filtering were conducted (Genedata
AG, Basel, Switzerland).

Quantitative real-time PCR
To examine mRNA expression, we treated cells
with vehicle (0 μM resveratrol) or 10 μM resveratrol
treatments for 6 h under different pH conditions
(pH values of medium were 6.8, 7.5 or 8.6). Total RNA
was extracted with TRIsure reagent (Bioline Ltd., London,
United Kingdom). To eliminate the contamination of
genomic DNA, total RNA was treated with DNase
I  (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
before first strand cDNA synthesis, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. As described previously
[41, 46], with slight modification, 1 μg of DNase I-treated
total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Tetro RT enzyme
