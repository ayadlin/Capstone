Abstract:

Treatment outcome of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has considerably
improved since the introduction of fludarabine (F) as part of the standard therapy.
Nevertheless, refractoriness to fludarabine occurs in a significant number of
patients and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Important risk factors
are 17p deletion and/or mutation of TP53. For this subgroup the CD52 antibody
alemtuzumab (A) presents a new treatment approach and has already been
approved. Meanwhile we have to face also refractoriness to alemtuzumab.
Importantly, the monoclonal CD20 antibody ofatumumab has now shown efficacy
in F and A double-refractory CLL. The next generation CD20 antibody GA-101 is
currently compared to rituximab (R) and will possibly be its more potent successor.
Further B-cell antigens are targeted by lumiliximab (CD23), TRU-016 (CD37) and
blinatumomab (CD19). Apart from monoclonal antibody therapies, a great number
of small molecules are examined for the treatment of refractory and relapsed
CLL. Most of these agents aim to overcome apoptosis resistance in CLL cells or
influence the microenvironment. Typical targets are regulators of the cell cycle
and antiapoptotic molecules like the members of the Bcl-2 family. Up to now the
most promising agents appear to be flavopiridol and lenalidomide among others.

Introduction

survival (PFS) (44.7% vs. 64.9% at 3 years, p<.001), and
overall survival (OS) (82.5% vs. 87.2% at 3 years, p=.01).
It was the first time that a 1st line therapeutic choice in
CLL showed significantly prolonged OS in a randomized
trial and confirmed previous data in historical comparison
performed by MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators
(Fig. 2) [2].

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
common type of leukemia in the Western world and still
incurable. What we consider today as gold standard for first
line treatment of patients without relevant comorbidities –
the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab combined
with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR) (Fig. 1)
[1] – is often sufficient to achieve durable remission.
However we face serious problems if this therapeutic
regimen fails and patients turn out to be refractory to
fludarabine. In this review we present new strategies
beyond conventional chemotherapies which are currently
under development or have already entered clinical trials.
Data of the German CLL Study Group’s CLL8 trial
showed the advantage of the immuno-chemotherapeutic
regimen FCR compared to the former standard FC [2].
817 patients were included. FCR treatment resulted in a
significantly higher complete remission rate (44  % vs.
22  %, p<.001), a significantly longer progression free

Fludarabine refractoriness and
relapse
Since more than 20 years fludarabine (F) has
proven to be effective in the treatment of CLL. In first
line monotherapy, there have been response rates of
63 to 80  % [3,4]. Nevertheless not all the patients
respond. Genetic analyses revealed the association of
fludarabine refractoriness with alterations of the short
arm of chromosome 17: 17p-deletion with mutation of
the remaining allele of TP53 or mutation of this tumor

suppressor gene without deletion. 6  % of untreated
patients show alterations in 17p but 53 % of the patients
who were refractory to fludarabine [5,6]. A recent analysis
of 328 cases of the CLL4 trial of the GCLLSG identified
the deletion of TP53 as the strongest prognostic factor
for
PFS and OS (Fig. 3). Furthermore, deletion of TP53

therapy [7,8].

point, while relapse of CLL is defined as recurrence of
the disease when the patient has reached at least a partial
remission for 6 months after therapy. Relapse within 2
or 3 years or refractoriness to F-based therapy influences
the prognosis in an unfavorable way [1].New therapeutic
strategies beyond conventional regimens like targeted
therapy aim to enhance response and survival rates also in
the refractory or relapsed situation.

Monoclonal antibodies

FCR is the standard regimen in CLL first line
treatment for patients without relevant comorbidity.
Its suitability for relapse has been examined in a phase
II trial in 2005. 177 patients were included. Complete
remissions were achieved in 25  %, partial remissions in
32 % of the cases. Overall response was 73 %. One third
of the patients with CR had also molecular remissions
with negative PCR results for the IGHV rearrangement of
the CLL clone in their bone marrow. 26 % of the patients
discontinued therapy because of heavy myelosuppression.
Grade 4 neutropenia was seen in 41 % of the cycles and
occurred at least once in 66 % of the patients. 16 % of the
patients developed sepsis, pneumonia or other infectious
complications which required hospitalization [12].

Rituximab
Because of the promising results of the MD Anderson
Cancer Center and the CLL8 trial, rituximab is today part
of the CLL gold standard treatment FCR. The monoclonal
IgG1-antibody is directed against the CD20 antigen on B
lymphocytes. Although CD20 expression levels on CLL
cells is much lower than in other B cell lymphomas it has
shown its high efficiency in CLL treatment especially in
combination treatments.
A phase II study of rituximab monotherapy showed
low clinical activity and short duration of response.
Rituximab was administered weekly at the common dose
of 375 mg/m² over four weeks [9]. The response rate
in a dose escalation study in pretreated patients (either
fludarabine or alkylating agents) was 36  % with only
partial remissions. Response correlated with dose, the
maximum dose given was 2.25 g/m². The group of other
B cell lymphomas showed response in 60 % of the cases
[10].
The strength of rituximab is combination therapy. A
response rate of 77 % and complete remissions in 15 %
were achieved by combination with bendamustine in a
randomized trial of the GCLLSG. Even high risk patients
with 11q-deletion, trisomy 12 and unmutated IGHV status
had benefit. 17p-deleted patients showed lower response
rates [11].

Alemtuzumab
Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a monoclonal IgG1antibody against CD52 on mature lymphocytes. This drug
was approved in 2001 for the treatment of fludarabine
refractory CLL in the USA and EU. Since 2008 it is also
approved for first line treatment of CLL in patients who are
expected to not respond to fludarabine which is the case in
17p-deletion or TP53 mutation. A large multicenter trial in
the USA and Europe of i. v. alemtuzumab administration
showed better survival data for patients with fludarabine
refractory CLL compared to historic cohorts. 93 patients
were included. CR rate was 2  %, PR was reached in
31  %. Median time to progression was 4.7 months and
median overall survival was 16 months. Transient

(30.2 months) than for patients without either abnormality (not reached; P < 0.001).

infusion reactions were the most common adverse
events, moreover infectious complications of grade 3 and
4 in 27  % of the patients [13]. The CLL2H trial of the
GCLLSG showed that subcutaneous alemtuzumab is as
effective as intravenous administration in F-refractory
CLL. The overall response rate was 34  % with 4  % of
complete remissions. Importantly, side effects of infusion
reactions were markedly reduced. Efficiency was the same
in all genetic subgroups, notably in 17p- and 11q-deletion,
TP53 mutation and unmutated IGHV status (Fig. 4) [14].
Patients with coexpression of CD20 and CD52
might benefit from the combination of rituximab and
alemtuzumab. This regimen has been examined over
four weeks in 32 patients with relapsed or refractory
CLL. Doses were once weekly 375 mg/m² rituximab and
twice weekly 30 mg alemtuzumab (with dose escalation
in the first treatment cycle from 3 mg over 10 mg to 30
mg). Overall response rate was 63  % with 2 complete
remissions and 50  % PR. Adverse events were of grade
2 or less [15]. Another trial evaluated this combination
in 40 pretreated patients. 64 % of them were fludarabinerefractory. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375
mg/m² on day 1, then 500 mg/m² weekly over up to 3
cycles. Alemtuzumab was first applied continuously i. v.
at a dose of 30 mg/day for 6 days, followed by 30 mg s. c.
twice a week from week 2 on. Infection prophylaxis was
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and valacyclovir until up
to 3 months beyond the completion of therapy. The overall
response rate was 53 % with 18 % of complete remissions.
The most adverse events were again infusion-related and
well manageable. Infections were seen in 28 % of the
patients; 15 % of the patients developed CMF infections
which were only detected in blood samples without organ
manifestation [16].
The combination of fludarabine and alemtuzumab
is called FluCAM. In a phase II trial 36 patients were
included. A high overall response rate was reached with
83 % (11 CR, 19 PR), but there were remarkable adverse
events: fungal pneumonia in two progressive patients
and one case of death caused by E. coli sepsis at CMV
reactivation [17].
Alemtuzumab has the highest “single-agent”
activity in CLL but involves risks in the form of infectious
complications like opportunistic infections and viral
reactivations (CMV, HSV). Obligatory is the prophylactic
administration of cotrimoxazole and acyclovir or similar
besides laboratory monitoring of CMV reactivation.
Combination of alemtuzumab with chemotherapy
and alemtuzumab maintenance approaches remain
experimental and should be performed in clinical trials.

Ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20)
Like rituximab, ofatumumab binds to CD20 on the
surface of B lymphocytes but targets a different epitope
and showed enhance in vitro complement dependent

cytotoxicity (CDC). Opposite to rituximab ofatumumab
is completely of human origin whereas rituximab is a
human-murine chimeric molecule. Since October 2009
ofatumumab received accelerated approval by the FDA
for the treatment of F and A double-refractory CLL.
This decision was mainly based on two clinical trials:
a multicenter, sequential dose-escalating cohort and
activity-estimating trial and a single-arm, fixed-dose,
multicenter trial.
33 patients were included in a phase I/II trial to
evaluate safety and efficacy of ofatumumab in patients
with refractory or relapsing CLL. In three cohorts different
dose escalation schemes of ofatumumab were tested over
four cycles. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached
and all in all ofatumumab was well tolerated. The majority
of the adverse events were infusion-related and transient
like pyrexia, fatigue, rash, increased sweating. Infections
were reported by 51 % of the patients. Most of them were
of grade 1 or 2, one was fatal (infectious interstitial lung
disease). The cohort with the highest dose (up to 2000 mg)
achieved a response rate of 50 %. There were no complete
remissions seen [18].
A phase II trial (NCT00349349) examined
ofatumumab as single-agent in patients who were either
fludarabine- and alemtuzumab-refractory (FA-ref, n =
59) or fludarabine-refractory and had bulky disease (BFref, n = 79) (Fig. 5). Overall response rates (measured
during therapy) were 58 % for the FA-ref group and 47
% for the BF-ref group. Former rituximab treatment had
no significant influence on efficacy. 54 % of the patients
who were pretreated with rituximab responded versus 63
% of the patients who were not exposed (FA-ref group).
Furthermore, clinical improvement was achieved for
constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly
and hematological parameters. Like in the dose-escalating
study cited above, the most common adverse events were
infusion reactions and infectious complications. Efficacy
was lower in CLL with 17p deletion [19].

Lumiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody
against CD23. High expression of CD23, a receptor
for IgE, is characteristic for CLL cells; on other cells,
expression levels are rather low. This fact provides a CLL
specific treatment modality.
In a phase I dose-finding trial in 46 CLL patients no
remissions were achieved, not even partially, though some
clinical activity could be detected. Lymphadenopathy
was reduced in 52 % of the patients, in 91 % lymphocyte
counts were modestly decreased. Lumiliximab was well
tolerated [20].
Based on this knowledge a phase I/II trial was initiated
to examine the combination of FCR with lumiliximab in
pretreated CLL patients. Inclusion criteria were CD23
positivity, progressive disease according to NCIWG
96. Refractoriness to FCR was exclusion criterium. The
overall response rate was 65 %, a complete remission was
achieved in 52 % of the patients. Compared to a historic
cohort treated with FCR [12], the CR rate was twice as
high (52 % vs. 25 %). The toxicity was comparable [21].

TRU-016
TRU-016 is a SMIP protein (Small Modular
ImmunoPharmaceutical) which targets CD37. It is a so
called single-chain polypeptide consisting of variable
regions (scFv) and the constant regions of human IgG1.
CD37 is expressed on normal and transformed B cells,
low expression levels are found on T cells, NK cells,
monocytes and granulocytes. In in vitro experiments
TRU-016 appeared to be more potent than rituximab or
alemtuzumab.
In a phase I trial 33 patients with CLL and SLL were
included. Applicable doses and two different application
schemes were evaluated. TRU-016 was intravenously
delivered either once weekly over four cycles or on day

with bovine serum. Accordingly, the necessary therapeutic
concentration of flavopiridol had been underestimated and
a revised schedule was developed. In a phase I trial 52
patients with relapsed, symptomatic CLL or SLL were
treated over four weeks once weekly with a loading
dose for 30 minutes, followed by 4 hours of continuous
infusion. One cycle took six weeks, six cycles were
administered. 40 % of the patients achieved a PR, median
progression free survival was 12 months. 30 patients
suffered acute tumor lysis syndrome, one patient died of it.
Most frequent adverse events were neutropenia, diarrhea
and cytokine-release syndrome [30]. 121 patients were
treated according to the protocol and received infection
prophylaxis against HSV/VZV and pneumocystis
jirovecii. A total of 43 infectious episodes occurred in 34
patients. Of those 22 were associated with grade 3 or 4
neutropenia. Infectious complications were pneumonia (4
%), bacterial sepsis (1 %), sinusitis or bronchitis (8 %),
viral respiratory tract infections (6 %), skin- or soft tissue
infections (4 %), catheter associated infections (6 %) and
infections of the urinary tract infections (2 %) [31].
In a phase II trial 64 pretreated patients were
included. They were treated according to the regimen
above with 30 mg/m² by i. v. bolus followed by 30 mg/
m² as continuous infusion for the first cycle. If there was
no severe tumor lysis syndrome, the dose for continuous
infusion was escalated to 50 mg/m² for the second and
following cycles. The protocol had to be changed after
an amendment: Cycle length was reduced to 4 weeks,
the number of treatments per cycle was reduced to 3.
20 mg of dexamethasone were administered to prevent
the cytokine release syndrome, ciprofloxacin was added
and pegfilgrastim on day 16 of each cycle. 47 % of the
patients achieved a partial, 1.6 % a complete remission.
The treatment’s tolerability was improved. In only 2 % of
the cases there was a tumor lysis syndrome [32].

1, 3 and 5 over six weeks in doses of 0.03 mg/kg up to 10
mg/kg. The drug was well tolerated with no unexpected
toxicity. Grade 4 neutropenia, herpes zoster and ITP
were seen as therapy-related SAEs. At a dose of 3 mg/
kg there was detectable biological activity. One patient
with 17p deletion achieved a partial remission whereas
lymphocytosis decreased about 83% in the median (13 %
up to 98 %). There was also an improvement of cytopenia
[22].

GA-101
GA-101 is a humanized and glycoengineered antiCD20 IgG1 monoclonal type II antibody which binds
with high affinity. The resulting antibody-dependent
cytotoxicity is 5- to 100-fold greater than that of rituximab.
Also direct cytotoxicity is enhanced. CD20 binding leads
to homotypic adhesion and following cell death induction
is non-apoptotic, actin-dependent and lysosome mediated
[23]. Further in vitro studies showed depletion of CLL
cells in whole blood assays and the superior efficacy of
GA-101 compared to rituximab [24].
In a phase I trial of GA-101 in patients with relapsed
or refractory CD20 positive NHL doses between 50 mg
and 2000 mg were given on days 1, 8 and 22 every 3
weeks for 9 cycles. 21 pretreated patients were included,
33 % with high risk cytogenetics and 70 % with unmutated
IGHV. ORR was 62 % with 1 CRi, 7 PR and 5 SD. GA101 was well tolerated. Infusion related reactions were
the most frequent side effects, followed by hematological
toxicity and infectious complications [25].
A phase II study of GA-101 monotherapy in
patients with relapsed CD20 positive indolent NonHodgkin Lymphoma compares the new CD20 antibody
to rituximab and is currently recruiting (NCT00576758).
A phase III trial in combination with Chlorambucil in
patients with comorbidity is currently active (CLL11 trial
of the GCLLSG, NCT01010061).

Lenalidomide
Lenalidomide is an immune-modulating drug, in its
structure similar to thalidomide but with more potential
in CLL and less side effects. Especially fatigue and
neuropathy are reduced. Teratogenicity is expected as it is
an analog of thalidomide. In various models, lenalidomide
inhibits cytokines like TNFalpha, VEGF and IL-6,
stimulates T- and NK-cells, induces apoptosis in tumor
cells and inhibits mitosis.
Two phase II trials examined lenalidomide in CLL.
A dose of 25 mg p. o. daily was administered for three
weeks in a cycle of 28 days. ORR was 47 %. 6 out of
23 fludarabine refractory patients achieved a PR, one
patient a CR. Hematological toxicity seems to be a major
problem: in 78 % of the cases occurred neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia [33]. In the second trial 44 patients
were treated continuously with 10 mg daily. Every 28
days the dose could optionally be escalated in steps

Small Molecules
Flavopiridol
Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
inhibitor which targets a broad range of CDKs. CDKs are
involved in the regulation of cell cycle, transcription and
mRNA processing. In CLL cell lines and primary cells
flavopiridol induces apoptosis via activation of caspase-3
[26]. Expression levels of Mcl-1 and XIAP which are
constitutively high expressed in CLL cells are decreased
[27].
Results of early clinical trials were disappointing
[28,29]. However, in vitro studies revealed that protein
binding of flavopiridol is much higher with human than

ABT-263

of 5 mg up to 25 mg daily. ORR was 32 %. 7 % of the
patients achieved CR, 10 % PR. 31 % of the patients with
11q- or 17p-deletion (combined) responded, 24 % of the
patients with unmutated IGHV and 25 % with fludarabine
refractory disease [34]. A subgroup analysis of the trial
showed that lenalidomide is also effective in patients
with high-risk CLL (combined 11q- or 17p-deletion).
ORR in these patients was 38 %, 19 % achieved complete
remissions, median progression-free survival was 12.1
months [35], however, more recent data indicate that this
is likely due to responses in patients with 11q deletion and
there is limited efficacy in cases with 17p deletion.
Typical side effects of lenalidomide treatment are
hematological toxicity and at higher doses the tumor flare
reaction with lymph node enlargement, leucocytosis,
abdominal pain, fever and rashes. Tumor lysis syndrome is
also often seen in lenalidomide treatment. Another phase
II trial compared the doses already used in the former both
trials: 25 mg and 10 mg. Five of 18 patients developed a
TLS, two cases were fatal. The protocol was changed to
a lower starting dose of 2.5 mg and slow dose escalation
which was carefully monitored. Patients got allopurinol
and hydration to prevent TLS. Kidney failure requiring
dialysis before treatment was an exclusion criterium. TLS
has not been observed in the amended protocol [36].

ABT-263 is a BH3-mimetic which is orally
administered. It binds to all members of the family of Bcl2 proteins with high affinity. In lymphoma cell lines which
express high Bcl-2 levels ABT-263 is a potent apoptosis
inducer. EC50 is about 1 µM [40]. Primary CLL cells are
very sensitive to ABT-737 the precursor drug of ABT-263
which is not orally bioavailable (EC50 = 7 nM, 4 hours
incubation time) [41].
A current phase I/IIa trial in patients with relapsed or
refractory CLL aims to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety
profile and efficacy of ABT-263. Two application schemes
are examined: first 10 to 250 mg of ABT-263 on day 1 to 14
(21-days cycle). This led to pronounced thrombocytopenia
as a direct toxic effect on platelets through inhibition of
Bcl-XL. To avoid this, patients got a loading dose of 100
mg for one week followed by a continuous application
up to 300 mg on all 21 days of the cycle. This reduced
fluctuation in the number of thrombocytes as well as early
thrombocytopenia. Most frequent adverse events were
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, thrombocytopenia
(20 %) and neutropenia (12 %). Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
was dose-limiting in three patients of the first group, in
the second group it was grade 4 thrombocytopenia and
nausea also in three patients. These results lead to the
recommendation of a loading dose of 100 mg for one
week, followed by a continuous dose of 250 mg/d [42].
A phase I trial about the combination of ABT-263
with FCR or BR is currently recruiting, moreover a phase
IIb trial of different oral dosage forms (NCT00868413,
NCT00918450).

Oblimersen
Oblimersen is an antisense oligonucleotide which
is applied intravenously. It inhibits the translation of the
Bcl-2 protein which is a potent apoptosis inhibitor. In CLL
expression levels of Bcl-2 are high.
A phase I/II trial examined oblimersen in 40 patients
with relapsed or refractory CLL. The maximum tolerated
dose was 3 mg/kg/d. Higher doses caused a cytokine
release syndrome with or without tumor lysis within 24
to 48 hours. 26 patients were eligible for evaluation. 8 %
achieved a partial remission [37].
Another phase II trial in 24 patients, of whom were 19
pretreated, the combination of oblimersen with rituximab
and fludarabine was tested. 68 % of the pretreated patients
responded, one even achieved a complete remission.
Side effects were well manageable. Neutropenia, nausea,
fatigue and fever, thrombocytopenia and anemia were the
most frequent adverse events [38].
241 patients were included in a phase III trial
which compared FC and the combination of oblimersen,
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. 17 % of the patients in
the experimental study arm achieved a complete or partial
nodular remission at least for 6 months compared to 7 %
of the patients treated with FC (p = 0.025). The five-year
survival was significantly prolonged in patients who had
achieved at least PR. Patients with fludarabine sensitive
disease had most benefit [39].

Obatoclax
The small molecule obatoclax inhibits the binding
of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family Bcl2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W and Mcl-1 to the proapoptotic proteins
Bax and Bak. This might restore the apoptotic machinery
of tumor cells.
The EC50 for primary CLL cells is 1.2 ± 0.1
µM. Synergistic effects are seen in combination with
fludarabine and chlorambucil [43]. Different doses
between 3.5 mg/m² and 14 mg/m² during one hour of
infusion and between 20 and 40 mg/m² during 3 hours
of infusion were tested for efficacy and safety as well
as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics in a phase
I trial. One cycle lasted three weeks. The patients were
pretreated and either fludarabine refractory or relapsed
after a fludarabine containing standard treatment. One
patient with bulky disease achieved a partial remission.
Remarkable were infusion associated neurological side
effects like somnolence, euphoria and ataxia. Hemoglobin
levels were increased in three patients which made
them independent of blood transfusions. Also their

recruiting (NCT01003769).

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors)

Dasatinib

The secondary structure of histones is modulated
by posttranslational acetylation, methylation and
phosphorylation. As a result histones dissociate from
the DNA-strand and transcription factors can bind to
their promoters. Deacetylation, demethylation and
dephosphorylation causes the opposite.
The most well known HDAC inhibitor is valproic
acid which is used as anticonvulsant. In primary CLL cells
valproic acid induces dose-dependent cytotoxicity via the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway. In combination with TRAIL
those cells are sensitized for apoptosis. Doses between 0.5
and 5 mM were used [45]. Clinical trials with valproic
acid as single-agent (NCT01016990) and in combination
with fludarabine (NCT00524667) are recruiting.
Two phase I trials on HDAC inhibitors in CLL have
already been published. 10 patients were treated with 13
mg/m² depsipeptide (FK228) in a dose finding study. All
the patients were pretreated either with purine analogs
or had a contraindication against those drugs. The cycles
lasted four weeks, depsipeptide was applied intravenously
on day 1, 8 and 15. Treatment was continued for at
least two months up to one year. Adverse events were
fatigue, nausea and loss of appetite. One patient suffered
a tumor lysis syndrome with renal failure and needed
hospitalization. There were neither partial nor complete
remissions. However biological activity was detected:
histone acetylation was increased up to 100 %, p21
expression was augmented [46].
Another phase I trial examined dosage and safety
of Belinostat (PXD101). 18 patients with different
hematological malignancies were included, two of them
had fludarabine refractory CLL. Both were treated for two
cycles. One cycle lasted three weeks. At a dose of 600 mg/
m² and 900 mg/m² on day 1 to 5 of each cycle they had
stable disease. The most frequent side effects were again
nausea and vomiting, fatigue and a flush syndrome. Doses
up to 1000 mg/m² seem to be well tolerable. There were
no distinct responses [47].

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib has shown
efficacy in CML and bcr/abl-positive ALL. Dasatinib
inhibits c-kit, EGFR and kinases of the Src-family
(SFKs). The SFK Lyn is highly expressed in CLL cells
and inhibition of SFK activity leads to apoptosis induction
in primary CLL cells. Further in vitro experiments showed
also synergistic effects of dasatinib with chlorambucil and
fludarabine [49]. CLL cells with unmutated IGHV seem to
respond better than those with mutation [50].
In a phase II trial in 15 patients a daily dose of
140 mg was administered. All patients had fludarabine
pre-treatment, five were refractory. In 2 patients partial
remissions were achieved, another 2 had nodal complete
remissions, 4 had nodal partial remissions. Adverse
events were mainly neutropenia (grade 3 and 4) and
thrombocytopenia (grade 3 and 4). All in all dasatinib
showed modest activity in CLL [51].

Conclusion
Current biologically-targeted therapeutic strategies
against relapsed and refractory CLL include antibodybased therapies as well as small molecules. Rituximab
in combination with chemotherapy is very effective in
CLL and standard in first-line and second-line therapy.
Fludarabine-refractory patients achieve an overall
response of 33 % by single-agent alemtuzumab. Today
we see patients who are not only fludarabine- but also
alemtuzumab-refractory. For those cases ofatumumab
is a promising option which has been approved for this
situation. Third-generation antibodies like GA-101
show in vitro even more efficacy than rituximab and are
currently further evaluated in clinical trials. The most
advanced small molecules are today lenalidomide and
flavopiridol. Response rates of 20 to 45 % were achieved
in relapsed/refractory CLL. A broad range of agents
with different mechanisms of action are in development
or have already entered clinical trials, but the prognosis
of chemotherapy-refractory patients is still unfavorable.
Thus new therapeutic strategies are needed and have to
prove not only efficacy but also a good safety profile.

Gossypol/AT-101
AT-101 is an enantiomer of gossypol which binds
with high affinity to the BH3 domain of the antiapoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 family. At a dose of 20 µM for 24
hours AT-101 induces 72 % apoptosis in the median in
primary CLL cells. This was also seen in coculture with
a bone marrow stromal cell line [48]. A phase II trial in
relapsed or refractory B cell neoplasms (NCT00275431)
and a phase II trial in combination with rituximab
(NCT00286780) has already been finished. Another phase
I/II study about the combination with lenalidomide is still
