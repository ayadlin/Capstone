Abstract

Author Manuscript

Melanoma cells driven by mutant B-RAF are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic treatments.
Recent Phase 1 results with PLX4032/RG7204/Vemurafenib, which selectively inhibits BRAF/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling in mutant B-RAF cells, has given encouragement to this struggling
field. Nearly all patients in the phase 1–3 studies saw at least some response and the overall
response rates were in between 81 and 48%. However, despite initial tumor shrinkage, most
responders in the trial experienced tumor relapse over time. These findings indicate that both
intrinsic and acquired resistance may affect the clinical efficacy of PLX4032. It is critical to
optimize PLX4032 activity to improve response rates and understand why some patients with the
B-RAF mutation do not respond. We have previously shown that the stemness factor, Forkhead
box D3 (FOXD3), is up-regulated following inhibition of B-RAF-MEK signaling in mutant BRAF melanoma cells. Here, we show that up-regulation of FOXD3 following treatment with
PLX4032 and PLX4720 (the non-clinical tool compound for PLX4032) confers resistance to cell
death. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of FOXD3 significantly enhanced
the cell death response after PLX4032/4720 treatment in mutant B-RAF melanoma cell lines.
Additionally, up-regulation of FOXD3 after PLX4720 treatment was attenuated in non-adherent
conditions and correlated with enhanced cell death. Ectopic expression of FOXD3 in non-adherent
cells significantly reduced cell death in response to PLX4720 treatment. Together, these data
indicate that up-regulation of FOXD3 is an adaptive response to RAF inhibitors that promotes a
state of drug resistance.

Introduction
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and the number of new cases of melanoma
increases every year. Advanced melanoma is associated with resistance to conventional
chemotherapies, and the 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic melanoma remains
low. In 50–60% of melanomas, mutations in the B-RAF serine-threonine kinase activate the
MEK-ERK1/2 pathway (Davies et al., 2002). The most common mutation in B-RAF is a
V600E substitution in the activation domain that causes its kinase function to remain
constitutively active (Davies et al., 2002). Overwhelming evidence shows that B-RAFV600E
is a driver mutation that promotes melanoma growth and survival (Dhomen and Marais,
2007). However, the presence of B-RAF mutations in the vast majority of benign nevi
indicates that B-RAFV600E is not sufficient for malignant progression (Michaloglou et al.,
2005; Pollock et al., 2003).

PLX4032/RG7204 (now known as Vemurafenib) was identified as a potent and selective
chemical inhibitor of mutant B-RAF signaling (Bollag et al., 2010). Recent phase 1–3 trials
with PLX4032 demonstrated that the majority of melanoma patients, selected for mutant BRAF positivity, show tumor regression (Chapman et al., 2011; Flaherty et al., 2010; Ribas et
al., 2011). The phase 3 trial in previously untreated patients additionally showed improved
overall survival and progression free survival (Chapman et al., 2011). However, the tumor
regression of most patients was only temporary and the length of tumor-free survival while
on PLX4032 averaged around seven months (Flaherty et al., 2010; Smalley and Sondak,
2010). Additionally, 19–52 % of patients in the phase 1–3 trials did not show tumor
regression by RECIST criteria (Chapman et al., 2011; Flaherty et al., 2010; Ribas et al.,
2011). These results indicate that in order to improve the current clinical treatment of mutant
B-RAF melanomas, intrinsic and acquired resistance should be addressed.

Previous data has associated the presence of stem cell-like subpopulations with
chemotherapeutic resistance of many cancers (Dean et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008). FOXD3
(formerly Genesis/HFH2) is a member of the Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor
family (Sutton et al., 1996). FOXD3 is important for maintaining the pluripotency and selfrenewal of embryonic stem cells (Hanna et al., 2002; Liu and Labosky, 2008), perhaps in
part through regulation of Nanog and Oct4 (Pan et al., 2006). In the developing neural crest,
Foxd3 is required for the maintenance of cells and regulates lineage specification (Mundell
and Labosky, 2011; Teng et al., 2008; Thomas and Erickson, 2008). Previous work from our
laboratory has shown that FOXD3 expression is up-regulated following inhibition of mutant
B-RAF-MEK signaling in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells (Abel and Aplin, 2010). Here, we
show that the up-regulation of FOXD3 after treatment with PLX4032 or its non-clinical
grade analog, PLX4720, provides resistance to cell death in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells.

Results
FOXD3 is basally expressed in a subset of mutant B-RAF melanomas
We have previously shown that FOXD3 is dramatically up-regulated following inhibition of
the B-RAF-MEK signaling pathway in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells (Abel and Aplin,
2010). FOXD3 up-regulation occurred at the mRNA level following B-RAF depletion/

inhibition in multiple cell lines (Abel and Aplin, 2010 and data not shown). While basal
FOXD3 expression was poorly detectable in the majority of melanoma cell lines, FOXD3
was detected in a subset, specifically: WM115, 1205Lu and A375 cells (Figure 1a). Basal
FOXD3 expression in these cells was comparable to the PLX4720-induced level in low
expressing lines such as WM793 cells (Figure 1b, left panel). We analyzed FOXD3
induction in WM115, 1205Lu and A375 cells following inhibition of mutant B-RAF
signaling using PLX4720, the non-clinical sister compound of PLX4032. PLX4720 acts in a
manner that is indistinguishable from PLX4032 (Bollag et al., 2010; Joseph et al., 2010;
Tsai et al., 2008). In WM115, 1205Lu and A375 cells, PLX4720 treatment induced
additional expression of FOXD3 (Figure 1b, right panel). In summary, a subset of mutant BRAF melanoma cells basally express FOXD3, which is further induced following B-RAF
inhibition.

FOXD3 provides resistance to the RAF inhibitors, PLX4720 and PLX4032

Author Manuscript

Since FOXD3 is a marker for embryonic stem cells (Sutton et al., 1996) and due to links
between cancer stem cells and drug resistance (Dean et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008), we
postulated that FOXD3 expression may protect melanoma cells from chemotherapeutics. We
focused on RAF inhibitors, as the clinical benefit elicited by PLX4032 is being hampered by
acquired resistance (Bollag et al., 2010; Flaherty et al., 2010; Smalley and Sondak, 2010)
and FOXD3 is up-regulated in response to B-RAF inhibition. To investigate the role of
FOXD3 in PLX4720 resistance, we efficiently knocked down FOXD3 in mutant B-RAF
melanoma cell lines, 1205Lu and WM115 (Figures 2a and b). PhosphoERK1/2 inhibition by
PLX4720 was equivalent between control and FOXD3 knockdowns suggesting no dramatic
alterations in drug efflux following FOXD3 knockdown. Knockdown of basal FOXD3
expression only slightly enhanced cell death in 1205Lu and WM115 cells; however,
knockdown of induced FOXD3 rendered both cell lines dramatically susceptible to
PLX4720 treatment based on increased Annexin V staining (Figures 2c and d). This effect
was observed with multiple independent siRNAs to FOXD3, arguing against off-target
effects. Increased cleaved caspase 3 was also observed in FOXD3-deficient cells treated
with PLX4720 (Supplementary Figure 1). Similar to PLX4720, FOXD3 knockdown also
enhanced cell death after treatment with the clinical grade compound, PLX4032
(Supplementary Figures 2a and b). Surprisingly, FOXD3 knockdown only marginally
enhanced the cytotoxic actions of a distinct RAF inhibitor, GDC0879 (Hoeflich et al., 2009)
and the MEK inhibitor, U0126, despite increased expression of FOXD3. (Supplementary
Figures 2c and d). No enhancement of annexin V staining was observed following FOXD3
knockdown in combination with the topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide. Thus, the effects
of FOXD3 cannot be generalized to other chemotherapeutics. In summary, FOXD3
depletion renders melanoma cells sensitive to PLX4720/4032-induced cell death.
FOXD3 expression is sufficient to promote resistance to PLX4720-induced cell death
Low FOXD3 expressing lines, such as WM793 and WM278 cells, are partially sensitive to
cell death in adherent cultures but dramatically susceptible to PLX4720 in suspension and 3D collagen (Shao and Aplin, 2010). We observed that non-adherent WM793 cells treated
with PLX4720 failed to efficiently induce FOXD3 expression, in the same conditions that a
distinct B-RAF effector, such as p27Kip1, still showed equivalent increases (Figure 3a, left

panels). WM115 cells, which are more resistant to PLX4720-induced cell death compared to
WM793 cells (Figure 3b), displayed adhesion regulation of FOXD3 expression but
importantly retained detectable expression of FOXD3 in PLX4720-treated non-adherent
cultures (Figure 3a, right panels).

Author Manuscript

Next, we tested whether FOXD3 expression was sufficient to promote resistance to
PLX4720. In these experiments, we utilized WM793TR-FOXD3 cells, in which FOXD3
expression could be induced in PLX4720-treated non-adherent cells (Figure 3c). As in
parental cells, PLX4720 treatment enhanced annexin V staining in non-induced WM793TRFOXD3 cells and in both non-induced and induced WM793TR-LacZ control cells.
Importantly, expression of FOXD3 significantly protected against PLX4720-induced cell
death in non-adherent conditions (Figure 3d). Expression of FOXD3 did not alter the ability
of PLX4720 to inhibit phosphoERK1/2, again arguing against alterations of drug efflux
(Figure 3c). These data suggest that FOXD3 expression provides protection against acute
cell death caused by PLX4720 treatment.
PLX4720 causes increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization in FOXD3-deficient
cells

Author Manuscript

Previous data has shown that melanoma cells undergo cell death after inhibition of ERK1/2
signaling that is dependent on mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Wang et al., 2007).
Therefore, we determined whether FOXD3-deficient cells showed changes in mitochondrial
membrane stability after PLX4720 treatment. Using multiple, independent siRNA
sequences, knockdown of FOXD3 caused a dramatic increase in mitochondrial membrane
depolarization after PLX4720 treatment in both 1205Lu and WM115 cells (Figures 4a and
b). Additionally, ectopic expression of FOXD3 decreased mitochondrial membrane
depolarization after PLX4720 treatment (Supplementary Figures 3a and b). This
demonstrates that cell death of FOXD3-deficient cells in response to PLX4720 treatment is
accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane integrity.
FOXD3 does not alter the expression of Bim-EL or Bmf after PLX4720 treatment

Author Manuscript

Cell death after ERK1/2 inhibition is dependent on changes in the expression of Bcl-2
family member proteins such as increased Bim-EL and Bmf expression and decreased Mcl-1
expression (Shao and Aplin, 2010; Wang et al., 2007). Increased mitochondrial membrane
depolarization in FOXD3-deficient cells did not correlate with increased PLX4720-induced
changes in the expression of Bim-EL and Bmf (Figures 5a and b), consistent with the notion
that FOXD3 depletion doesn’t potentiate inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling. Further
analysis did not identify any consistent difference in the expression of other Bcl-2 family
members (Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, puma, noxa, Bid, Bnip3 or Bip) between
FOXD3-expressing cells and FOXD3-deficient cells after PLX4720 treatment (data not
shown). Additionally, ectopic expression of Mcl-1 was unable to fully rescue the increased
cell death of FOXD3-deficient cells treated with PLX4720 (Supplementary Figures 4a and
b). In summary, FOXD3 provides resistance to mitochondrial membrane depolarization
independent of changes in Bim-EL, Bmf or Mcl-1 expression.

FOXD3-deficient cells have a decreased ability to develop long-term resistance to PLX4720

Author Manuscript

Our data show that FOXD3-deficient cells display high levels of cell death after short-term
exposure (48 hr) to PLX4720 (Figures 2c and d). Since most patients in the PLX4032
clinical trials develop resistance after long-term exposure, we determined the effect of
FOXD3 knockdown in the presence of chronic exposure to PLX4720. Control siRNA
transfected cells showed initial survival against PLX4720 that was maintained through 28
days of treatment. However, cells that were initially depleted of FOXD3 had a decreased
ability to establish PLX4720-resistant colonies (Figures 6a and b). This demonstrates that
preventing FOXD3 up-regulation decreases long-term resistance to PLX4720.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

It is hypothesized that subpopulations of tumor cells, termed cancer stem cells, may have
inherent chemotherapeutic resistance (Dean et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008). Our data indicate
that the stemness factor, FOXD3, promotes melanoma cell resistance to a clinically relevant
RAF inhibitor. FOXD3 is up-regulated following inhibition of the B-RAF/MEK/ERK1/2
pathway selectively in mutant B-RAF melanoma cell types (Abel and Aplin, 2010). Thus,
FOXD3 up-regulation may be an adaptive response to B-RAF inhibition. Melanoma cells
are well known for their plasticity (Hendrix et al., 2007). Recently, Sharma et al. have
suggested that tumor cells have the potential to convert to a transient, drug-tolerant state that
allows subpopulations of cells to maintain viability after a potentially lethal stimulus
(Sharma et al., 2010). Notably the transient nature of this tolerant state is predicted to result
in additional tumor cell death following further rounds of treatment with intervening “drug
holidays”. In their studies, drug tolerance was mediated by enhanced signaling via IGF-1R
and by enhanced expression of the histone demethylase, JARID1a (Sharma et al., 2010).
FOXD3 may play a role in opposing the formation of active chromatin structures in
pluripotent cells (Liber et al., 2010). Furthermore, FOXD3 up-regulation was reversible
following removal of PLX4720 (data not shown), similar to the drug tolerant state in the
Sharma et al. study. Together these studies indicate that an adaptive chromatin regulation
response to targeted therapies that may contribute ultimately to the acquisition of a resistant
state.

Author Manuscript

The acquisition of a drug tolerant state is thought to provide a time window for secondary
genetic events that provide permanent resistance. Recent studies have uncovered some of the
mechanisms associated with acquired resistance to PLX4032 (Aplin et al., 2011). In one
study, secondary mutations in N-RAS were detected in two relapsing metastases from the
same patient (Nazarian et al., 2010). Supporting evidence in cultured cell systems
demonstrated that expression of N-RAS in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells was sufficient to
nullify the inhibitory effect of PLX4032 on the ERK1/2 pathway and cell growth (Nazarian
et al., 2010). Studies from the Garraway group indicate that up-regulation of the MAP3K,
Cot1, and acquired mutation in MEK1 provide other routes to promote re-activation of the
ERK1/2 pathway in relapsing tumors (Johannessen et al., 2010; Wagle et al., 2011).
ERK1/2-independent resistance mechanisms have also been proposed. PDGFRβ was upregulated in relapsing tumors from four out of eleven PLX4032-treated patients and
PDGFRβ knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in cell lines that have

acquired resistance to PLX4032 in culture (Nazarian et al., 2010). PLX4032 resistant lines
with up-regulated expression of PDGFRβ were resistant to MEK inhibitors. An additional
study from the Herlyn group has implicated up-regulation of IGF-1R and activation of the
Akt pathway in acquired resistance to PLX4032 (Villanueva et al., 2010). These data are
consistent with our previous findings that constitutive Akt3 activity counteracts PLX4720induced apoptosis in melanoma cells (Shao and Aplin, 2010). Together, these data indicate
that FOXD3 may promote a transient resistant state that is superseded by permanent
resistant mechanisms such as secondary mutations in N-RAS or MEK1, up-regulation of
MAP3Ks and up-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases.

Author Manuscript

Loss of ERK1/2 signaling in melanoma cells leads to up-regulation of pro-apoptotic BH3only domain proteins including Bim-EL and Bmf (Shao and Aplin, 2010). However, BimEL and Bmf up-regulation in FOXD3-deficient cells following PLX4720 treatment is
comparable to the up-regulation observed in control cells, consistent with FOXD3-mediated
effects being independent of the ERK1/2 activation status and FOXD3 depletion not
affecting drug efflux. Therefore, FOXD3 up-regulation after treatment with RAF inhibitors
may permit the survival of melanoma cells despite strong pro-apoptotic signaling. FOXD3
knockdown rendered cells highly sensitive to PLX4720 and PLX4032 but surprisingly less
sensitive to the RAF inhibitor GDC0879, the MEK inhibitor U1026, and B-RAF depletion
(Supplementary figure 2 and data not shown). It is currently unclear if this is due to a more
selective nature of PLX4720/4032 towards mutant B-RAF or whether PLX4720/4032 are
targeting additional kinases. With regard to the latter, PLX4720 and PLX4032 inhibit with
several kinases, for example protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6, BRK), at nanomolar IC50
values in vitro (Bollag G et al. 2010 and Tsai et al. 2008). Thus, it is possible that additional
PLX4720/4032 target inhibition may cooperate with ERK1/2-dependent increases in BH3only proteins to promote pro-apoptotic effects.

Author Manuscript

Regardless of the mechanism of FOXD3 action, our studies indicate that quantifying
FOXD3 basal expression and PLX4032-induced up-regulation of FOXD3 in patients may be
a correlate for disease-free survival benefit with this drug. We also show that up-regulation
of FOXD3 following treatment with PLX4720 is attenuated following loss of adhesion to
the extracellular matrix. Adhesion-dependent FOXD3 up-regulation correlates with
enhanced cell death susceptibility following B-RAF inhibition. It is therefore possible that
blockade of signals from the extracellular matrix through treatment with integrin inhibitors
may offer a benefit as a combination therapy with PLX4032.

Basal and PLX4720-induced FOXD3 expression in melanoma cell lines. (a) Total cell
lysates from a panel of mutant B-RAF melanoma cell lines were analyzed by Western
blotting using antibodies to FOXD3 and actin (loading control). (b) WM793 cells (low basal
FOXD3) were treated with DMSO (−) or 5 μM PLX4720 for 24 hrs. WM793 cell lysates
were analyzed alongside WM115 and 1205Lu cell lysates from basal conditions for FOXD3,
phosphoERK1/2, ERK2, and actin. WM115, 1205Lu and A375 cells were treated with
DMSO (−) or 5 μM PLX4720 for 24 hrs. Cell lysates were similarly analyzed by Western
blotting.

Knockdown of FOXD3 increases cell death after acute treatment with PLX4720. (a) 1205Lu
cells were transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or three distinct FOXD3 siRNA
sequences (#2, #5, and #18). After 72 hrs, fresh media containing either DMSO or 5 μM
PLX4720 was added for an additional 24 hrs. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western
blotting, as indicated. (b) Same as (a) except with WM115 cells. (c) Same as (a), except that
cells were harvested and stained with Annexin V-APC for cell death analysis after 48 hrs of
PLX4720 treatment. Representative traces are shown. X axis, fluorescence intensity; Y axis,
cell counts, with percent of Annexin V-APC staining-positive cells indicated. Quantitation
of data from three independent experiments is represented by the mean percentage of cells
staining positive for Annexin V-APC. Error bars represent standard error. **p value<0.01
comparing PLX4720-treated, non-targeting control knockdown cells to PLX4720-treated
FOXD3 knockdown cells based on unpaired Student t-test. (d) Same as (c), except that
WM115 cells were analyzed.

FOXD3 expression protects cells from anoikis after PLX4720 treatment. (a) WM793 and
WM115 cells were maintained on plates coated with 2% Bactoagar (Sus) or allowed to
adhere to uncoated plates (Adh) −/+ 5 μM PLX4720. After 24 hrs, cells were lysed in
sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting, as indicated. (b) Same as (a) except that
cells were harvested and stained with Annexin V-APC for cell death analysis after 48 hrs of
PLX4720 treatment. Quantitation of data from three independent experiments is represented
by the mean percentage of cells staining positive for Annexin V-APC. Error bars represent
standard error. (c) WM793TR cells harboring doxycycline-inducible β-galactosidase (β-gal;
LacZ) or FOXD3 were induced with 100 ng/mL doxycycline for 72 hrs. Cells were then
detached and maintained on 2% Bactoagar −/+ 5 μM PLX4720 for a further 24 hrs. Cells
were lysed and lysates analyzed by Western blotting. (d) Same as (c), except that cells were
harvested and stained with Annexin V-APC after 48 hrs. Quantitation of data from three
independent experiments is represented by the mean percentage of cells staining positive for
Annexin V-APC. Error bars represent standard error. **p value<0.01 comparing PLX4720treated cells in the absence and presence of doxycycline based on unpaired Student t-test.
