ABSTRACT
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway is emerging as
a promising therapeutic target for multiple myeloma (MM). In the present study, we
performed a virtual screen against 800,000 of small molecule compounds by targeting
PI3Kγ. C96, one of such compounds, inhibited PI3K activated by insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1), but did not suppress IGF-1R activation. The cell-free assay revealed
that C96 preferred to inhibit PI3Kα and δ, but was not active against AKT1, 2, 3 or mTOR.
C96 inhibited PI3K activation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Consistent
with its inhibition on PI3K/AKT, C96 downregulated the activation of mTOR, p70S6K,
4E-BP1, but did not suppress other kinases such as ERK and c-Src. Inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by C96 led to MM cell apoptosis which was demonstrated
by Annexin V staining and activation of the pro-apoptotic signals. Furthermore, C96
displayed potent anti-myeloma activity in a MM xenograft model in nude mice. Oral
administration of 100 mg/kg bodyweight almost fully suppressed tumor growth within
16 days, but without gross toxicity. Importantly, AKT activation was suppressed in tumor
tissues from C96-treated mice, which was consistent with delayed tumor growth. Thus,
we identified a novel PI3K inhibitor with a great potential for MM therapy.

marketed proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators,
however, MM remains incurable, and the median survival
period is 3–5 years with conventional treatments [2]. All
current drugs inherit limited efficacy and/or severe toxicity
or adverse effects [3, 4], therefore, developing novel agents
is in an urgent need, especially in targeted drug discovery.
Among the “druggable” targets in MM, the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal pathway
is of particular interest. PI3K/AKT plays a critical role
in regulating a myriad of cell signals involved in cell
proliferation, migration and survival of MM [5–7].
There are four isoforms in the Class I PI3K superfamily,
including PI3Kα, β, δ and γ, all of which have been
demonstrated to be overactivated in MM cells [8, 9]. PI3K
dysregulation is closely associated with overexpressed
growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1), and cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) [10,
11]. These extracellular signals bind to specific receptors
(e.g. IGF-1R and IL-6R), and then activate PI3K, which
catalyzes the production of PI(3,4,5)P3, a key second
messenger, that further mediates AKT activation and
downstream signals in the MM pathophysiology [12].
The PI3K/AKT signal pathway is highly associated with
chemoresistance and poor prognosis of MM, thus being
developed as a promising target for MM therapy [8].
With the advances of combinatorial chemistry, cancer
biology, informatics technology and bioengineering, several
important strategies and techniques have been developed,
including structural optimization, high throughput screen,
and computer-based in silico screen [13]. A virtual screen
belongs to the in silico screens, which utilizes highperformance computing to identify possible drug candidates
which are most likely to bind to a drug target, typically a
protein receptor or an enzyme. Compared with traditional
high throughput screens, virtual screens are reliable, costeffective and time-saving [14]. In the present study, we
performed a virtual screen against 800,000 small molecule
compounds from ChemBridge and Specs Chemicals libraries
by using PI3Kγ as the subject. PI3Kγ is frequently expressed
in MM cells [8, 9], and several inhibitors of PI3Kγ have
been developed in the preclinical stages for MM therapy,
such as CAL-101, IPI-145, BEZ235, and PI-103 [15], which
established a rationale for the discovery of PI3K inhibitors.
More importantly, the molecular interaction of small chemical
inhibitors and PI3Kγ has been clearly elucidated [16, 17].
Therefore, PI3Kγ is a well established target for the discovery
of PI3K inhibitors. After several rounds of screens and
cell- and mouse-based studies, C96, one of these compounds,
was identified as a promising candidate for MM therapy.

as shown in Figure 1, we subsequently verified its
inhibitory activity against PI3K in MM cells using
AKT phosphorylation as a readout. MM cell lines LP1
and OPM2 were starved overnight before being treated
with C96 (0–100 μM) or S14161 (100 μM, a positive
control [6]) for a short period (2 hrs), followed by IGF-1
stimulation for 15 min. Immunoblotting revealed that
C96 significantly suppressed AKT phosphorylation in a
concentration-dependent manner in the presence of IGF-1
but had no effects on total AKT expression, which was
similar to the effects of S14161, the proven PI3K inhibitor
[6] (Figure 2A). In LP1 cells, C96 at 25 μM and 50 μM
led to a 50% and 90% decrease in AKT phosphorylation,
respectively, in the 2-hr treatment. AKT phosphorylation
was also markedly decreased by C96 in OPM2 cells which
does not express PTEN, a negative modulator of the PI3K
signaling pathway (Figure 2A, right panel). In the timecourse study, AKT activation was suppressed by C96 at
50 μM within 0.5 hrs (30 min) (Figure 2B). These studies
suggested that C96 inhibited PI3K activity in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner.
The PI3K/AKT plays a critical role in regulating a
myriad of downstream effectors [18], of which the most
prominent ones are mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1. Many PI3K
inhibitors eventually modulate cell proliferation and
survival by disrupting this particular pathway [19]. To
examine whether PI3K inhibition led to deregulation of
the mTOR signaling pathway, we further measured the
changes of mTOR, p70S6K and 4E-BP1 in MM cell lines
LP1, OPM2, and JJN3 in the presence of C96. As shown
in Figure 2C, C96 downregulated the phosphorylation
levels of these proteins in all examined cell lines in a
concentration-dependent manner.

C96 does not inhibit phosphorylation of
other kinases
The above studies demonstrated that C96 inhibited
the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, whether it affects
activities of other kinases was not known. To elucidate
this specificity, we first evaluated its effects on IGF-1R
because IGF-1R as a receptor tyrosine kinase activates
PI3K in the presence of IGF-1. To exclude the potential
effects of C96 on IGF-1 signaling, LP1 and JJN3 cells
were starved overnight followed by C96 or S14161
treatment for 2 hrs, and IGF-1 stimulation for 15 min.
As expected, IGF-1 triggered AKT phosphorylation but
it was suppressed by both C96 and the proven PI3K
inhibitor S14161 without affecting total AKT expression
(Figure 3A). In this treatment, IGF-1R phosphorylation
was sharply induced by IGF-1, but it was not affected by
C96 (Figure 3A). This result suggested that C96 inhibited
PI3K activity independent of IGF-1R signaling. Next, we
evaluated other kinases including non-receptor kinase
c-Src and a PI3K parallel kinase ERK which transduces
external cellular signals. Both LP1 and JJN3 cells were

treated with C96 at increasing concentrations that inhibited
AKT and mTOR activation (Figure 2C). However, C96
did not decrease the phosphorylation level of neither
c-Src nor ERK (Figure 3B). These results thus suggested
that C96 probably mainly inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway.
To confirm this hypothesis, we next evaluated the
effects of C96 on PI3K family (PI3Kα, β, δ, and γ) and
associated enzymes including AKT1, 2, 3 and mTOR, in
a cell-free enzymatic system as reported previously [6]. It
turned out that C96 preferred to inhibit PI3Kα and δ with
an IC50= 5.41 and 7.05 μM, respectively, and less activity
against PI3Kβ and γ (IC50=134 and 116 μM, respectively)
as shown in Figure 4, but displayed no significant effects
on AKT1, 2, 3, or mTOR because all enzymatic activities
were higher than 50% even at 300 μM concentration,
and their IC50 values were not detectable (Supplemental
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Table 1). Taken together, all the above studies suggested
C96 was a preferred inhibitor of PI3K, especially the α
and δ isoforms, thus suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway.

C96 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis
of MM cells
Because PI3K/AKT signaling is critical in
modulating MM cell proliferation and survival, while
interference with this pathway will lead to cell death and
regression of MM tumors [6, 8], we next asked whether
C96 could induce MM cell apoptosis and inhibited
MM cell proliferation. MTT assays indicated that C96
suppressed cell proliferation and reduced cell viability
of a panel of MM cell lines including LP1, OPM2, JJN3,
OCI-My5, RPMI-8226, U266, and KMS11 within 72 hrs

and the expression of p-AKT, p-IGF-1R, total AKT (T-AKT), and IGF-1R proteins were detected by immunoblotting. (B) LP1 and JJN3
were treated with C96 at indicated concentrations for 24 hrs followed by immunoblotting assay for the expression of p-Src, c-Src, p-ERK,

(Supplemental Figure 1). Next, we measured the induction
of apoptosis by C96 in MM cell lines. Apoptotic cells are
featured with inside-out expression of phosphatidylserine
which is specifically identified by Annexin V, a cellular
protein in the annexin group [20]. Therefore, to measure
the apoptotic level, C96-treated cells were stained with
Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide followed by flow
cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 5, 20 to 60% of
cells underwent apoptosis in the treatment of C96 at 10 μM
within 24 hrs. This result was confirmed by the cleavage
of PARP, a biomarker of cell apoptosis (Figure 6A). For
example, less apoptotic cells were induced by C96 in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

KMS11 cells in the Annexin V staining assay (Figure 5), the
cleavage level of PARP in this cell line was also lower than
that seen in other cell lines, such as OPM2 (Figure 6A).
We next examined the apoptotic signaling pathway in the
treatment with C96 with increasing exposure periods or
concentrations. Three cell lines LP1, OPM2, and JJN3 were
treated with C96 at 0, 5, 10, or 20 μM for 24 hrs or 10 μM
for 3, 6, 9 and 12 hrs. Immunoblotting analysis revealed
that C96 induced cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in a
time- and concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6C).
All the above results demonstrated that C96 induced MM
cell apoptosis.

Next, we evaluated the effects of C96 on MM
cell growth by measuring viable cells after starvation/
IGF-1 stimulation in the presence of C96. As shown in
Supplemental Figure 2A, IGF-1 stimulated MM cell
growth, but it was suppressed by C96. We also examined
the effects of C96 on MM cell migration upon IGF-1
stimulation. In all three cell lines (LP1, OPM2, and
JJN3), LP1 and JJN3 failed to but OPM2 cells could
migrate through the 8-micrometer transwell membrane
in the presence of IGF-1, and this migration was partly
suppressed by C96 (Supplemental Figure 2B). These
data suggested that C96 inhibited MM cell mobility in
the presence of IGF-1 but it was probably determined

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by individual cell lines because not all MM cells could
migrate through the membrane.

C96 delays tumor growth in a MM xenograft
model in association with the inhibition of the
PI3K signaling pathway
To further evaluate the anti-myeloma efficacy of
C96 in vivo, a human multiple myeloma xenograft model
was established by subcutaneous injection of JJN3 into
nude mice. When these tumors were palpable, mice were
randomly divided into two groups (n = 5) and one of them
were orally administrated C96 (100 mg/kg body weight,

1/10 of the oral LD50), the other one were given the same
volume of vehicle on a daily base for continued 16 days.
Tumor sizes and body weight were monitored every other
day. As shown in Figure 7A, C96 delayed MM tumor
growth during the experimental period. In contrast, the
tumors in the vehicle group grew in a steady rate. However,
the 16-day treatment of C96 had minimal effects on body
weight (Figure 7B), and there were no gross toxicity
observed in all mice treated with C96 (data not shown).
We also measured the changes of the phosphorylation
status of AKT and mTOR, two key proteins in the
PI3K signaling pathway, in the myeloma tumor tissues.
Immunoblotting indicated that both AKT and mTOR

phosphorylation was decreased in the myeloma tumor
tissues excised from C96-treated mice (Figure 7C), which
were consistent with MM tumor growth treated by C96.
Therefore, C96 delayed tumor growth of myelomas in
vivo, which was associated with the inhibition of the PI3K
signaling pathway and was consistent with the in vitro
studies.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we identified C96 as a potential
PI3K inhibitor via virtual screening and subsequent
cellular and mice studies against MM.

The PI3K-centered signaling pathway has
significance in MM pathophysiology, chemotherapy,
as well as clinical prognosis. Consistent with these
findings, blockade of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
with chemical or genetic methods leads to MM cell
apoptosis and MM tumor regression [21]. Therefore,
targeting PI3K is a key strategy for MM therapy [22]. In
the last two decades, robot-assisted large scale targeted
drug screens have been significantly implemented due
to the advancements in bioinformatics, informative
technologies, molecular cancer biology, and synthetic
chemistry[13, 23, 24]. In terms of PI3K, the elucidation
of crystal structures of PI3K isoforms including
co-crystallized ligands and apo-structures deposited in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has made virtual screening
possible [14, 25]. As an attractive possible filter, a
virtual screen offers an opportunity to minimize the wet
laboratory workload [26]. Using these structure-based
virtual screening and extensive docking studies, several
PI3K inhibitors have been identified [14, 26, 27]. In the
present study, we performed a virtual screen against
PI3Kγ because this isoform has been most studied and
its crystal structure has been well defined [16, 28]. Using
PI3Kγ as the screening subject against the ChemBridge
and Specs chemical libraries, we identified C96 as a
potential candidate that was further verified in both
cellular and mice models. Consistent with the prediction,
C96 inhibits PI3K activation and blocks the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway thus inducing MM cell apoptosis.
However, the enzymatic assay in a cell-free PI3K system
showed that C96 prefers to inhibit PI3Kα and δ although
it was screened out against the γ isoform. This is very
interesting but it is highly possible. Firstly, all isoforms
share a similar structure of the ATP binding pocket,
therefore, there are many important pan-Class I PI3K
inhibitors [29]. Secondly, the virtual screen is based
on the theoretical interactions between compounds and
specific enzymes, however, the actual interactions may
vary in the cell-free and in the cell-based assays [30].
After all, the real interaction is determined by the specific
physical and chemical properties of the compounds and
the specific structure of the receptor enzymes [30]. In the
case of C96, it is probable that C96 fits better in the α and
δ active pockets in the native status, such as in cells or in
the purified enzymes. We also believe a preferred inhibitor
of the α and δ PI3K isoforms merits further investigation
because these two isoforms are overexpressed in MM
cells but less expressed in normal blood cells [8].
More importantly, the γ isoform is required in T cell
functions and in the migration of leukocytes, in particular
neutrophils and macrophages [31]. Therefore, the
preference of C96 on the α and δ isoforms will be more
important for the potential application for the treatment of
MM. This finding also indicated that the virtual screens
must be coupled with wet laboratory investigations,
especially at the cellular and at the animal levels. After
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

all, the virtual screen is a theoretical prediction, and the
cellular and animal studies must be performed because the
“real” human being system is very complicated.
In MM cells, the PI3K signaling is particularly
important because it is modulated by various extracellular
stimulators, such as the growth factor IGF-1, and the
cytokine IL-6, both of which are frequently over-expressed
and secreted in MM cells thus stimulating PI3K activation
[10, 11]. IGF-1R activation leads to sustained activation of
PI3K thus increasing cell proliferation and survival [32].
Therefore, PI3K inactivation could be due to the effects
on the suppression of these membrane signals, such as
IGF-1R and IL-6R activation [33]. Some PI3K signaling
transduction can be blocked by inactivating IGF-1R and/or
IL-6R. However, C96 displays no inhibitory effect on IGF1R phosphorylation but markedly inhibits AKT activation,
suggesting that C96-mediated PI3K inhibition is not due
to its effects on the IGF-1R signaling. More importantly,
C96 downregulates PI3K and its subsequent signaling
transduction, including the AKT/mTOR pathway, however,
its shows no inhibitory effects on other kinases such as
c-Src and ERK, suggesting that C96 prefers to inhibit
the PI3K/AKT signaling transduction. This is consistent
with the cell-free assay in which C96 inhibits the catalytic
activity of PI3K but it does not inhibit kinases such as
AKT1, 2, 3 or mTOR associated with PI3K. Although
C96 has not inhibition on the catalytic activity of AKT or
mTOR, it suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR,
p70S6K, and 4E-BP1, which is probably attributed to PI3K
inhibition. Downregulated PI3K/AKT signal transduction
leads to suppressed downstream signals, such as the
phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K, which has been
reported previously [5, 34]. In tumor tissues from a mouse
xenograft model established with human MM cell line
JJN3, both AKT and mTOR activation was also decreased
by C96, which is consistent with studies at the the cellular
level, therefore, C96-delayed myeloma tumor growth is
consistent with its inhibition on PI3K. These results thus
collectively concluded that C96 is a preferred inhibitor of
PI3K.
In the last decade, a lot of PI3K inhibitors have
been developed and some have shown great potencies in
preclinical studies against varied cancer types [18, 29], of
which some belong to thiazolidinones, 2-aminothiazoles,
or 2-morpholinothiazoles. By comparing with those
already known PI3K inhibitors, C96 is featured with a
novel chemical structure, therefore it probably represents
a novel class of PI3K inhibitors. Moreover, C96 displays
a very potent activity in vivo but without marked
toxicity. The EC50s against PI3K alpha and delta in the
cell-free enzymatic system are around 5 μM, which is
acceptable. More importantly, C96 showed great potency
in killing MM cells at low micromolar concentrations and
suppresses the growth of MM xenograft in nude mice at a
dose less than 1/10 LD50. At this dose, C96 did not show
marked toxicity to mice but suppressed tumor growth
3844

Oncotarget

more than 90% within 16 days. This is very essential
because some known PI3K inhibitors are able to suppress
PI3K activity at low nanomolar levels, but they need to
reach a concentration up to 10 μM to induce MM cell
death. For example, BAY80-6946 displays a high activity
against all PI3K isoforms with IC50s from 0.5 to 6.4 nM in
the cell-free enzymatic system, it requires more than 1000
nM to inhibit MM cell proliferation [9]. Another case is
CAL-101, one of the most potent inhibitor of PI3Kγ and δ,
whose IC50s in inhibiting PI3K activity are around 2.5 nM,
however, it needs more than 10 μM to induce MM cell
death [8]. These data indicated that cell-free potency is
not consistent with its biological activity, and C96 might
have better metabolic parameters than some known PI3K
inhibitors.
In a summary, by a virtual screen and further studies
at both cellular and mice models, C96 was identified as
a novel potent PI3K inhibitor, especially against PI3Kα
and δ. Because of its efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo
and undetectable toxicity in vivo, C96 can be developed as
a promising PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of MM, but
clinical relevance should be further investigated.

docking calculations were accomplished by using the
Glide module in Schrödinger (version 9.0). According to
the binding fitness, each compound was assigned a score.
Compounds with the highest scores were moved to the
next screen with a stricter condition. All structures were
docked and scored using the Glide HTVS, SP, XP modes
step by step and 1,500 compounds were returned as prohits. Then, chemical similarity clustering of the pro-hits
was performed to maximize the chemical diversity of
the selected compounds for biological assay using the
Selector Module in SYBYL 8.1 and 148 compounds as
top-hits were obtained. Lastly, all these 148 compounds
were purchased from ChemBridge or Specs, and were
applied for cell-based and mouse-based evaluation. C96,
5-(3-(2-thienyl)-2-propen-1-ylidene)-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)pyrimidinetrione, was chosen for further investigation.
The detailed flow chart for the virtual screening was
shown in Figure 1.

Growth inhibition assay
MM cells were dispensed in 96-well plates at a
density of 8×103 cells per well and treated with increasing
concentrations of C96 for 72 hrs, and the growth inhibitory
effect of C96 on MM cells was assessed by an MTT assay
as reported previously [6]. To show the effect of C96 on
cell growth in the presence of growth factor IGF-1, MM
cells were first maintained in IMDM media containing
0.5% FBS for 12 hrs, followed by C96 treatment alone or
in combination with 100 ng/mL of IGF-1. Cells were then
incubated for another 24 hrs, relative cell proliferation was
analyzed by an MTT assay.

streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and were grown at 37°C in an
incubator supplied with 5% CO2.

Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis
MM cells treaded with C96 at concentrations from
0 to 20 μM, 24 hrs later, cells were stained with Annexin
V-FITC and PI according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Sigma, St Louis, MO). Apoptotic cells were measured on
a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) as
reported as previously [36].

Chemicals
C96 was purchased from ChemBridge Corporation,
San Diego, CA. IGF-1 was purchased from PeproTech
[5]. Annexin V-FITC, propidium iodide, MTT or
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-sodium
bromide were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO).

Kinase activity in cell-free assays
Kinase activity in the presence of C96 was
performed by using the HotSpot technology (Reaction
Biology Corp., Malvern, PA, USA) [6]. Briefly, kinases
(PI3Kα, β, δ, γ, AKT1, 2, 3, and mTOR) and substrates
were diluted in reaction buffer [6]. Subsequently, 5 nL of
serially diluted C96 (in pure DMSO) was delivered into
diluted kinase and substrate mixture by using Echo 550
(LabCyte Inc. Sunnyvale, CA). The reaction was started
by adding 33P-ATP (hot ATP) into the reaction mixture (the
final concentration was 10 μM) and stopped after 2 hrs
incubation at room temperature. The un-reacted hot ATP
was washed away before detection.

Virtual screening
The crystal structure of PI3Kγ (PDB entry: 3APC)
[35] from the RCSB Brookhaven Protein Data Bank was
used as the initial structure for the virtual screening. The
databases of 200,000 compounds from Specs (Delft,
The Netherlands, http://www.specs.net/) and 600,000
compounds from ChemBridge (San Diego, United States,
http://www.chembridge.com) were used as the initial
sources for the screen against PI3Kγ [14]. The molecular

ultrasonicated in the lysis buffer to extract proteins, which
were further applied for immunoblotting analyses using
specific antibodies against AKT, p-AKT, p-mTOR, mTOR,
and GAPDH. This xenograft study was carried out in
accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical
Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments in
animals and it was approved by the Animal Ethics and
Welfare Review Board of Soochow University.

Cells were treated with or without C96 for 24 hrs
before being applied to lysate preparation in a lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
Na- deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM
EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, and 5 mM NaF) [6]. Equal amounts
(30 μg) of total proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
separation, followed by immunoblotting analyses with
specific antibodies. Antibodies against PARP, caspase-3,
AKT, p-AKT(S473), 4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1(S65), IGF1R, p-IGF-1R, ERK(p42/p44), and p-ERK(p42/p44)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Antibodies against mTOR, p-mTOR(S2448), p70S6K,
p-p70S6K(S424), and GAPDH were obtained from Abgent
(Suzhou, China). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugate
secondary antibodies against mouse or rabbit and GAPDH
were purchased from Abgent. All immunoblotting signals
were further analyzed with Quality One Quality One
software (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA).

Cell migration analysis by the transwell assay
This assay was performed as described previously
[37]. Briefly, MM cells OPM2, JJN3 and LP1 were serum
starved overnight and then re-suspended in 70 μL of
IMDM medium/0.5% fetal calf serum with or without
C96. These cells were then loaded onto polycarbonate
membranes (8-μm pore size) separating 2 chambers
of a transwell (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA).
Medium/0.1% FCS (500 μL) containing agonist IGF-1
was added to the lower chamber of the Transwell cluster
plates. After 6 hrs, cells migrating into the lower chamber
were counted using a hemacytometer.

Myeloma xenograft study
JJN3 cells (30 million cells/injection) were
inoculated s.c. into the right flanks of nude mice (5–6
weeks old, female, Shanghai Slac Laboratory Animal
Co. Ltd., Shanghai). When tumors were palpable, mice
were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5). One
group was orally administrated C96 (100 mg/kg body
weight, or 1/10 oral LD50) dissolved in PBS containing
10% Tween 80 and DMSO daily for continued 16 days,
another group was received the vehicle only. Tumor
sizes were measured every other day with a caliper and
calculated according to the formula (V=0.5236a²b, where
a is the smallest superficial diameter and b is the largest
superficial diameter) [6, 36] . Body weight of each mouse
was also monitored. At the end of the experiment, mice
were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber containing dry ice.
Tumor tissues were then excised, weighed, and snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen for further studies. To examine
protein expression, tumor tissues were minced and
