Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cervical cancer is responsible for 10–15% of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide1,2. The
etiological role of infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPV) in cervical carcinomas
is well established3. Previous studies have implicated somatic mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53,
STK11 and KRAS4–7 as well as several copy number alterations in the pathogenesis of cervical
carcinomas8,9. Here, we report whole exome sequencing analysis of 115 cervical carcinomanormal paired samples, transcriptome sequencing of 79 cases and whole genome sequencing of 14
tumor-normal pairs. Novel somatic mutations in 79 primary squamous cell carcinomas include
recurrent E322K substitutions in the MAPK1 gene (8%), inactivating mutations in the HLA-B gene
(9%), and mutations in EP300 (16%), FBXW7 (15%), NFE2L2 (4%) TP53 (5%) and ERBB2 (6%).
We also observed somatic ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) mutations in 24 adenocarcinomas.
Squamous cell carcinomas had higher frequencies of somatic mutations in the Tp*C dinucleotide
context than adenocarcinomas. Gene expression levels at HPV integration sites were significantly
higher in tumors with HPV integration compared with expression of the same genes in tumors
without viral integration at the same site. These data demonstrate several recurrent genomic
alterations in cervical carcinomas that suggest novel strategies to combat this disease.
The prevention of cervical cancer by Pap smear-based screening and treatment programs has
been largely successful in resource-rich countries. However, cervical cancer is the 2nd most

common cause of cancer-related deaths in women in developing countries, where many
patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of disease with limited treatment options and poor
prognosis1. Recent advances in targeted therapy against specific somatic alterations have
transformed the management of cancers in general10, and the discovery of novel therapeutic
targets in cervical cancer could improve upon current strategies to combat cervical
carcinomas.
To provide comprehensive data on the landscape of genomic aberrations that contribute to
cervical cancer, we investigated a cohort that included 100 patients from Norway and 15
patients from Mexico (Supplementary Notes 1–7). We performed exome sequencing of
193,094 exons, covering a median of 34.2 Mb at a median of 89x (range: 56–122x) coverage
for tumor samples and 88x (range: 69–122x) coverage for normal samples, followed by
calling of somatic mutations using the Mutect algorithm11, and identified a total of 17,795
somatic mutations across the entire dataset, including 11,419 missense, 936 nonsense, 4,643
silent, 219 splice site, 29 translation start site mutations, as well as 401 deletions and 131
insertions.

The aggregate nonsilent mutation rate across the dataset was 3.7 per Mb. However,
squamous cell carcinomas had a higher rate of nonsilent mutations (4.2 mutations/Mb) than
adenocarcinomas (1.6 mutations/Mb) (Wilcoxon p =0.0095). The clinical, pathologic,
epidemiologic and mutational characteristics of the tumors are summarized in
Supplementary Figs. 1–6, Supplementary Tables 1–6 and Supplementary Notes 8 and 9.
Hierarchical clustering of all 115 tumors based on the mutational context revealed that most
tumors were characterized by previously described12 mutational signatures: with
predominantly Tp*C to T/G mutations and *CpG to T mutations (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig.
4). Tp*C mutations were present at a relative frequency of >0.5 in 53 (46%) tumors, and the
relative frequency of Tp*C mutations was positively correlated with mutation rates,
especially in squamous cell carcinomas (Fig. 1, Supplementary Notes 8, Supplementary Fig.
5). In addition, 5648 (54%) of the 10328 non-silent mutations observed in squamous cell
carcinomas were Tp*C to T/G mutations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We performed mutation significance analyses on 79 squamous cell carcinomas and 24
adenocarcinomas. Genes were determined to be significantly mutated if recurrent mutations
were found in that gene at a false discovery rate of q<0.1 after correction for multiple
hypothesis testing, as previously described13 (Supplementary Note 6). Details of candidate
mutation validation are presented in Supplementary Figs 6 and 7.
As expected, recurrent mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN and STK11 were present in 14%, 6%,
and 4%, respectively, of 79 squamous cell carcinomas (Table 1). In addition, we found
significantly recurrent mutations in EP300 (16%), FBXW7 (15%), HLA-B (9%), MAPK1
(8%), and NFE2L2 (4%), here reported for the first time, to our knowledge, in primary
squamous cell cervical carcinomas (Table 1, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary
Fig. 8). In addition, TP53 (9%) and ERBB2 (5%) were found to be significantly mutated in
analyses focused only on genes previously reported as mutated in the COSMIC database
(http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic) (Supplementary Table 9a).

Interestingly, 3 of the 6 ERBB2 mutations (S310F, S310Y and V842I; Supplementary Fig.
8) are known oncogenic driver mutations and in vitro therapeutic targets in lung 14 and
breast cancer15.
Somatic MAPK1 mutations were observed in 6/79 squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix
(7%), each involving a G-to-A transition resulting in recurrent E322K mutations in 4
individuals, and E81K and E220K mutations in 1 individual each (Fig. 2). To our
knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent mutations of MAPK1 in primary human
cancer, although the MAPK1 E322K mutation has been reported in an oropharyngeal
carcinoma cell line16 and scattered unpublished reports are summarized in COSMIC. The
recurrent site-specific MAPK1 mutations and the known role of the MAPK signaling
pathway in cancer17 suggest the possibility that mutant MAPK1 may exert oncogenic
activity.

We observed EP300 and FBXW7 mutations in our dataset, similar to recent reports in
endometrial and head and neck cancers18,19. Thirteen of 15 nonsilent EP300 mutations are
novel in cancer, with 8 of these (including 2 nonsense) residing in the histone
acetyltransferase and bromo- domains required for EP300 activity20 (Fig. 2). In addition,
there were 2 truncating mutations at residues S255 and Q458 in EP300. The FBXW7 gene
also had 2 novel truncating mutations at residues Q631 and R678, with 10 other mutations
residing in the WD40 domains required to form the scaffold for the Skp1-Cul1-F-box
protein complex21 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, all four NFE2L2 mutations (W24C,
R34P, R34Q and E82D) are in the domain required for interacting with its negative
regulator, KEAP122 (Fig. 2), consistent with similar findings in lung squamous cancers23.
Interestingly, mutations in these genes (FBXW7, EP300, MAPK1, NFE2L2) occur largely in
a non-overlapping pattern in our dataset (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6b). These observations
suggest that epigenetic regulation and the oxidative stress response may play important roles
in cervical cancer pathogenesis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We found 4 missense and 3 frameshift mutations in the HLA-B gene encoding the
histocompatibility leukocyte antigen HLA-B (Table 1, Fig. 2). In addition, there were
somatic mutations in other genes involved in antigen presentation, including splice site,
nonsense and frameshift mutations in HLA-A, a gene previously reported as mutated in
squamous cell carcinomas of the lung23, and in the beta-microglobulin (B2M) gene
(Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 7). All mutations in these 3 genes were within
the antigen presenting domains of each respective protein24. Intriguingly, pathway analyses
also revealed that the most significantly mutated geneset in squamous cell carcinomas
involves immune response genes in the interferon gamma signaling pathway, including
mutations in IFNG, IFNGR1, IKBKB, JAK2 and other genes (Supplementary Table 10a).
Together, these data highlight the potential significance of the synergy between HPV
infection and an altered immune response in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas
of the cervix.
We also investigated a smaller subset of 24 adenocarcinomas. Our analysis revealed the
ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) genes as recurrently mutated at q< 0.1 (Table 1, Fig. 2,
Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 8). In addition, PIK3CA (16%) and KRAS (8%)

were found to be significantly mutated in analyses focused only on genes previously
reported as mutated in the COSMIC database (Supplementary Table 9b), consistent with
previous reports6. Furthermore, geneset analyses revealed that the PIK3CA/PTEN pathway
was significantly recurrently mutated across the adenocarcinoma subset (Supplementary
Table 10b).
The ELF3 mutations in the adenocarcinomas involve frameshift insertional events at amino
acid positions 255, 330 and 350. ELF3 (E74-like factor-3) encodes a member of the ETS
transcription factor family which is expressed and upregulated in epithelial cancers, and is
both a regulator and downstream effector of the ERBB2 signaling pathway25. Interestingly,
ELF3-mutated tumors have higher gene expression levels than ELF3 wildtype tumors
(Supplementary Fig. 9).

The spectrum of somatic copy number alterations, rearrangements, gene expression profiles,
HPV integration and other genomic events observed in this cohort are documented in
Supplementary Notes 10–14, Supplementary Tables 11–22, and Supplementary Figs. 10–30.
HPV integration sites were defined by the presence of least six chimeric read pairs, derived
from RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data, in which the pairmate of an HPV sequence read
mapped to the human genome (Supplementary Note 7). As expected, HPV integration sites
were found within or in close proximity to several fragile sites (Supplementary Note 11) as
well as previously reported genes26–29 including MYC, ERBB2, TP63, FANCC, RAD51B
and CEACAM5 (Supplementary Table 15).
HPV integration occurred closer to amplified regions than expected by chance (Mann
Whitney p < 2.2 x 10−16; Fig. 3a), with 21 (41%) of 41 integration sites overlapping with
amplified regions, supporting the hypothesis that viral integration may trigger genome
amplification30. In general, viral integration was localized to one locus in most tumors
investigated, and most of the integration sites were observed only in one tumor each
(Supplementary Table 15). In addition, many of the genes involved in the integration events
are members of cellular pathways known to play important roles in cancer (Supplementary
Table 16). Similar to recent observations29, we observed recurrent HPV integration into the
RAD51B locus in three different tumors; intriguingly, each involved a different HPV type:
HPV16, HPV18, and HPV52 (Supplementary Figs. 20–22).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also observed that gene expression levels at sites of HPV integration were significantly
higher in tumors with HPV integration compared with the expression levels of the same
genes across the other tumors without integration at that site (p < 2.2 x 10−16; Fig. 3b;
Supplementary Figs. 22–24). For some integration sites, including MYC, ERBB2, GLI2,
TNIK, NR4A2, PROX1, EIF2C2, FAM179B, and SERPINB4, high gene expression levels
were associated with copy number gains (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 25). Conversely, there
were no copy number changes at several other highly expressed integration sites including
RPS6KB1, MAFA, PARN, EGFL7, SNIP1, POC1B, and BCL11B (Fig. 3c, Supplementary
Figs. 26, Supplementary Note 11E and 11F), supporting the hypothesis that the elevated
expression of these genes may be driven in part by the integrated viral promoter27.

In summary, this study has demonstrated relationships between recurrent somatic mutations,
copy number alterations, gene expression and HPV integration in cervical carcinomas. We
report significantly recurrent somatic mutations in the MAPK1 gene in squamous cell
cervical cancers, to our knowledge the first such report in human cancers. In addition, we
found evidence of potential ERBB2 activation by somatic mutation, amplification, and HPV
integration, suggesting that some cervical carcinoma patients could potentially be considered
as candidates for clinical trials of ERBB2 inhibitors. Furthermore, our data suggest that
alterations in immune response genes may synergize with HPV infection in the pathogenesis
of squamous cell carcinomas. Finally, our data suggests that the association between HPV
integration and increased expression of adjacent genes is a widespread phenomenon in
primary cervical carcinomas.

METHODS
Sample preparation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All samples were obtained under institutional IRB approval and with documented informed
consent. Surgically resected tumors or biopsies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80° C. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from tumors found by frozen
section investigations to have > 40% malignant epithelial cell component. A detailed
description of sample collection is found in Supplementary Note 1. Nucleic acid was
extracted using standard protocols described in Supplementary Note 2.
Sequence data generation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DNA from 115 tumor/normal paired samples was subjected to Agilent Sure-Select Human
All Exon v2.0 based hybrid selection31 followed by exome library construction for Illumina
sequencing, and 14 pairs for whole genome library construction; cDNA from 79 samples
was subjected to transcriptome library construction, according to standard methods. Twelve
tumor/normal pairs were sequenced with all three types of libraries. All libraries were
sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument (Supplementary Note 4). Exome
sequencing was performed using a hybrid capture of 193,094 exon targets from 18,862
coding genes. Reads were aligned to human genome build GRCh37 using a BurrowsWheeler aligner32. Data from the Illumina HiSeq were converted into BAM files 33 (http://
samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)for each sample, using Picard (http://
picard.sourceforge.net/) (Supplementary Note 6A).
Variant calling and significance analysis
All variant calls and significance analysis were obtained using the standard Cancer Genome
Analysis Pipeline 13,34–37 with some modifications detailed in Supplementary Note 6B.
Cross-individual contamination was estimated using ContEst 38 with both SNP Array
(Supplementary Note 5) and sequencing data as input. SNV and Indel calls were generated
using MuTect 11,13,34,35 and Indelocator 13,34,35, respectively, for all complete exome
tumor-normal pairs. Variants were mapped to genes and transcripts using Oncotator, as well
as being annotated with useful information such as overlapping COSMIC39 records. DToxoG (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/dtoxog) was used to filter mutations
generated by a sequencing artifact that was discovered during this project. Significantly

mutated genes and gene sets (Supplementary Note 9) were identified by MutSig2.0 based on
the SNV and indel calls. Mutation rate calculations were also provided by MutSig2.0.
Rearrangements were identified, using dRanger 36 running on 14 WGS tumor-normal pairs
(Supplementary Note 13A), based on read pairings with unexpected distance or orientation.
Somatic copy number alterations, both broad and focal, were identified with the GISTIC
2.013,35 tool, using segments identified from exome sequencing data (Supplementary Note
6B) as input (Supplementary Note 10A). Overlap between copy number alterations and
somatic nonsilent mutations, for a subset of significantly mutated genes, are reported in
Supplementary Note 10D and Supplementary Figure 14. UnifiedGenotyper 40,41 was used to
identify germline mutations in genes in the Fanconi anemia pathway and TERC, as reported
in Supplementary Note 14B and Supplementary Note 14C. ABSOLUTE 42 was used to
generate purity and ploidy estimates for tumor samples where SNP Array data was available
(Supplementary Table 3).
Variant validation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two validation approaches were used in this study. The first was to resequence mutations in
significant genes. Libraries were constructed with 200 bp flanks around key mutations in
significant genes and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Manual validation was performed by
examining mutations in the resulting BAM files. Mutations were considered validated if
supported by five or more reads. The second validation approach was to compare exome
SNV calls against the corresponding WGS and/or RNASeq calls where available. Mutations
were considered validated if the alternate allele was seen in at least two reads and the
calculated power was 80% or higher. These two approaches are detailed in Supplementary
Note 6D. Due to the variable nature of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes43, mutations
in HLA-A and HLA-B were validated manually using the procedure detailed in
Supplementary Note 6E.
Hierarchical clustering of mutation signatures

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hierarchical clustering of all 115 samples, by nucleotide mutational context, using the
heatmap.2 function from the gplots library (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/
index.html) implemented in R 2.15.1 was performed. Mutation counts were scaled within
each sample (i.e. converted to fraction of mutations corresponding to each category) and
clustered using Ward’s minimum variance method44. Analysis of associations between
mutation signature clusters and epidemiological factors (age, histology, geography, tumor
grade and smoking status) was performed using Kruskal-Wallis, for continuous factors
(age), and Fisher’s Exact Test, for discrete factors (histology, geography, tumor grade, and
smoking status). A p-value threshold of 0.05 was used to decide association for all statistical
testing. A detailed description and results can be found in Supplementary Note 8A. For
display purposes in Figure 1, Tp*CpG mutations (which belong to both groups) are
redistributed proportionately to each group, based on the relative frequencies of the other
Tp*C and*CpG mutations in each tumor.

Hierarchical clustering of copy number variants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Copy number profiles, generated by GISTIC 2.0, were clustered into three categories. Each
category was tested for association with tumor grade and histology using Fisher’s Exact Test
and a p-value threshold of 0.05 (Supplementary Note 10B).
Gene expression analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Gene expression was measured using Cufflinks and cuffdiff 45 from the RNASeq data and
fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) was obtained. Since
non-transcribed genes tend to have more artifactual mutations 36,37,46,47, genes with low
expression values (FPKM < 1) were filtered from significantly mutated gene lists produced
by MutSig2.0 (Supplementary Note 6C). Genes with detected HPV integration sites were
further analyzed for increased expression levels by ranking the expression levels of relevant
genes for each sample (Supplementary Note 11E, Supplementary Note 11F, Supplementary
Note 11G). Consensus clustering was performed on the RNASeq-derived gene expression
data from 79 tumors, using ConsensusClusterPlus48. This analysis was run, using 1000
resampling iterations and a maximum of 25 clusters, on the 5000 genes with the largest
deviation of FPKM scores across all patients. A final k value was chosen based on minimum
threshold of change as k was increased (Supplementary Note 12). The correlative
relationships between copy number variation and gene expression data were evaluated using
Pearson correlation (Supplementary Note 10C).
Fusion analysis in transcriptome
RNASeq data was analyzed for fusion events by identifying inter-chromosomal chimeric
read pairs or exon-exon read pairs separated by at least 1 Mb, with pairmates in the
appropriate coding strand orientation. Unmapped reads spanning the putative fusion junction
were also identified. High confidence fusion events are defined as having at least 3 reads
mapped to a junction fusion (Supplementary Note 13B).
HPV typing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HPV typing was done by 2 multiplex HPV DNA PCR methods: the flourescent f-HPV
assay49 and the mass spectrometry-based HPV PCR-MassArray50,51 (Supplementary Note
3A). Additionally, PathSeq 52 was used to generate HPV typing information from RNASeq
data (Supplementary Note 3B).
HPV genome integration analysis
PathSeq 52 was used to identify sites of HPV genome integration in the cohort
(Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Note 11A). Integration sites were identified
using paired reads where one read aligned to the HPV genome (using NCBI viral databases)
and the other to the human genome (Supplementary Note 11C). Validation of a recurrent
integration site, in RAD51B, was performed by RT-PCR using primers targeting the
junctions of specific HPV-RAD51B chimeric reads in three tumors (Supplementary Note
11B). In cases where the tumor with an integration site also had SNP array data, the distance
between the integration site and the nearest copy number amplification was calculated. SNP
Array data were used to identify amplifications. To evaluate co-occurrence of integration

sites and copy number amplifications, data for a null model was created by simulating
integration sites at uniformly distributed locations in the genome and assigning the
simulated integration sites to random samples. The distribution of distances between the
simulated integration sites and nearest copy number amplification compared to the true
distribution of distances (Supplementary Note 11D). In Figure 3a, the true data (top
histogram) was compared to distances generated from 100,000 permutations of randomly
distributed integration sites across the genome with respect to the observed amplifications
(bottom histogram). Overlapping amplification/integration sites have a distance of 0.
Integration sites without amplification on the same chromosome were assigned a distance of
the longest chromosome plus 1 (the bars on the right). MSigDB 53 was queried to evaluate
whether the HPV integration sites co-occur in pathways with known roles in cancer
(Supplementary Note 11H).
Epidemiological analysis for mutation rates

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The statistical significance of mutation rate across histological types was corrected for the
epidemiological factors: age (continuous), geography (discrete), tumor grade (discrete), and
smoking status at diagnosis (discrete). The Fisher’s Exact Test, for discrete factors, and the
Wilcoxon Test, for continuous factors, were run across histology (squamous cell and
adenocarcinomas only). A p-value threshold of 0.05 was used to decide association for all
statistical testing. For factors where an association was found with histology and mutation
rate, we used a linear regression model to test whether histology was an independent
predictor of mutation rate (Supplementary Note 8B).
Analysis of miscellaneous genes and pathways of interest
Additional analysis of notable genesets and pathways were performed using different
techniques depending on the task. APOBEC mutations in the Tp*C context were counted
and results reported in Supplementary Note 14A. The Fanconi anemia pathway has been
implicated in suppressing HPV infection. Mutated genes in the Fanconi anemia pathway
were identified from the somatic SNV, somatic Indel, and germline calls (Supplementary
Note 14B). TERC has been identified as a marker for genomic instability and copy number
gain. Therefore, we identified copy number variations encompassing the TERC gene as well
as somatic and germline SNV and indel mutations (Supplementary Notes 14C)

Fig. 1. Relationship of mutational spectrum and rates with clinicopathological characteristics in
cervical carcinoma

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All panels are aligned with vertical tracks representing 115 individuals. The data is sorted in
order by histology (middle panel) and total mutational rate (top panel). The relative
frequencies of nucleotide mutations occurring at cytosines preceeded by thymines (Tp*C) or
at cytosines followed by guanines (*CpG) sites are depicted in red and orange respectively,
on the second panel. The bottom heatmap shows the distribution of mutations in
significantly mutated genes (q<0.1) in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas in
the order listed in Table 1. TP53, ERBB2 and KRAS were significant recurrence (q<0.1)
among cancer driver genes reported in COSMIC.

Fig. 2. Novel recurrent somatic mutations in cervical carcinoma

The locations of somatic mutations in novel significantly mutated genes in 115 cervical
carcinoma, FBXW7, MAPK1, HLA-B, EP300, NFE2L2 and ELF3 are shown in the context
of protein domain models derived from UniProt and Pfam annotations. Numbers refer to
amino acid residues. Each filled circle represents an individual mutated tumor sample:
missense and silent mutations are represented by filled black and grey circles, respectively
while nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations are represented by filled red circles and
red text. Domains are depicted with various colors with an appropriate key located on the
right hand of each domain model.

Fig. 3. Relationships between HPV integration, copy number amplifications and gene expression
in cervical carcinoma

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Panel (a) shows comparative histograms of true and simulated genomic distances between
HPV integration sites and the nearest copy number amplification (log segmean difference
>0.5). Panel (b) shows boxplots of gene expression levels across 79 cervical tumors for 41
genes with chimeric human-HPV read pairs. The expression levels for tumors with HPV
integration in the respective genes are highlighted in red circles. Panel (c) shows scatter
plots comparing copy number alterations and gene expression levels across 79 tumors in
selected integration site genes. The red circles represent data for the tumors with HPV
integration events involving the respective genes.
