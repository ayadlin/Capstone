Abstract
Cancer stem cells have been isolated from human gliomas and
many other parenchymal tumors. It was previously assumed
that many established malignant cell lines also contain a rare
subpopulation of stem cells. This study was designed to
investigate the fraction of cancer stem cells in the C6 glioma
cell line using clonal and population analyses, rather than
isolating methods, which are based on specific markers.
Interestingly, in the serum-containing medium, each of the
67 single C6 cells plated per miniwell was able to generate a
clone and subclones, which subsequently gave rise to a
xenograft glioma in the BALB/C-nude mouse. The CD133 C6
cells also possessed clonogenic, self-renewal, and tumorigenic
capacities. Moreover, our findings indicated that brief exposure
to Hoechst 33342 was harmful to the clonogenicity and
proliferation of individual C6 cells. Therefore, the non–sidepopulation cells may be deprived of their stem cell features in
the process of Hoechst 33342 staining as a step in isolating
a Hoechst-negative side population with flow cytometry.
Thus, we concluded that the C6 line was mainly composed
of cancer stem cells, although many of them were neither
CD133+ nor side population. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3691–7]

Introduction
Gliomas consist of heterogeneous populations of cancer cells.
The tumor is regarded as an aberrant organ containing a minor
fraction of cancer stem cells and a major fraction of nontumorigenic tumor cells (non–stem cells). Although both the stem
cells and the non–stem cells contain the oncogenic mutations that
result in tumorigenesis, the latter population lacks the capacity for
perpetual self-renewal (1–3).
Recently, both the tumorigenic and nontumorigenic subsets of
cancer cells have been isolated from human gliomas (4, 5) and
other solid tumors (3, 6). Three methods have been introduced to
isolate cancer stem cells from parenchymal tumors. First, several
groups, using serum-free culture medium similar to that used to
culture neural stem cells, reported cancer stem cells from gliomas
or glioblastomas proliferating and forming ‘‘tumorospheres’’ (7–9);
individual cells from the primary sphere were able to form a new
sphere during serial passages, suggesting that these cells could
self-renew. Second, cancer stem cells were isolated based on the
expression of CD133 (10), a marker expressed by normal neural
stem cells. Only the CD133+ cells collected using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) or immunomagnetic beads were

capable of forming spheres (11). These studies suggest that central
nervous system tumors contain a subpopulation of stem cells.
Third, the ‘‘side-population’’ (SP) in the tumor is composed of
cancer stem cells (12). SP cells express ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters, which pump out the fluorescent nuclear dye
Hoechst 33342. Therefore, they were not stained by Hoechst 33342
and could be isolated by FACS (13). Although different methods
were used, studies of cancer stem cells from brain tumors still
concluded that only a very small portion of the cancer cells are
clonogenic, and they alone are capable of tumor propagation (1).
These methods were also used to isolate stem cells from
established cancer cell lines. It is unknown if this principle holds
for the glioma cell line C6, which has been maintained in vitro
over decades.
The C6 line contains only 0.4% SP cells (14). In serum-free
medium, C6 SP cells, but not non-SP cells, can generate both SP
and non-SP cells, and they are mainly responsible for the in vivo
malignancy of this cell line. Therefore, only the C6 SP cells are
considered cancer stem cells (14, 15). Here, however, we show that
most C6 cells possess the main defining characteristics of cancer
stem cells. We showed that most cells in this line generated cell
clones when cultured in medium with, but not without, serum.
Once the cell clones were transplanted into nude mice, they gave
rise to xenograft tumors. The essential attribute of the cancer stem
cell is the capacity to generate and perpetuate a tumor of its own
origin. In summary, we showed that most C6 cells were cancer
stem cells, whether or not they expressed CD133 or ABC
transporter, and serum-free medium was dispensable in isolating
and expanding cancer stem cells of glioma in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. C6 glioma cells were provided by the Shanghai Institute of
Biochemistry and Cell Biology (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in
serum-containing or serum-free medium at a density of 1  105 cells/mL.
The serum-containing medium was composed of DMEM/F12 (Hyclone,
Logan, UT) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY). The serum-free medium was composed of DMEM/F12,
20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Sigma, St. Louis, MO),
20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma), and 20 AL/mL B27
supplement (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated at 37jC with 95% air,
5% CO2, and 100% humidity.
Preparation of single-cell suspension. For quantitative and clonogenic
analysis, it is important to prepare single-cell suspensions without
influencing viability significantly. The procedures were done as described
previously (16, 17), with some modification. Briefly, cells were harvested,
incubated in PBS buffer containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.012% EDTA for
20 min at room temperature, and triturated gently twice every 5 min using a
fine polished Pasteur pipette. The suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm
for 5 min to collect the cells. The supernatant was removed carefully and
completely. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh medium (with or
without serum). The resultant suspension was filtered through a fine mesh
sieve. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion
assay, and the number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer.

Serial clonogenic analysis. To determine a cell’s self-renewal ability, a
single-cell suspension was prepared as described above (10 cells/mL),
seeded into 96-well plates (100 AL per well), and cultured in serumcontaining or serum-free medium. Wells containing no cells or more than
one cell were excluded, and those with only one cell were marked and
checked daily under a microscope to count the number of cell clones. After
2 weeks, the clones were dissociated and cultured similarly in new 96-well
plates to generate subclones.
Tumorigenicity. Subclones from the 96-well plates were transferred to
six-well plates and expanded in serum-containing medium. The clonal cells
(1  105) were then injected s.c. into the backs of 4-week-old BALB/C-nude
mice (supplied by the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China). Mice were treated according to the
guidelines of the Zhejiang University Animal Committee. The mice were
examined visually everyday. When the xenograft tumors grew to about 8 mm
in diameter, the mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital. The tumors were then dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution. Paraffin sections were prepared following routine
procedures. H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining for glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were done on the sections, which were then
examined under a microscope to verify the tumorigenesis pathologically.
Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin sections of the xenograft tumors were
hydrated, immersed in a solution of 3% H2O2 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked
with rabbit serum for 1 h. The sections were then incubated with rabbit
anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:100; Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA), which is a
marker of malignant tumors of glial origin, for 2 h at 37jC, followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 1 h at 37jC. The result was visualized using
diaminobenzidine as the chromogen for 5 min.
BrdUrd incorporation assay. To determine whether the tumorosphere
generated in the serum-free medium a cell clone derived from one mother
stem cell (1, 11, 18) or just a mixture of many clones, we did a
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay for three groups: BrdUrd
labeled, BrdUrd nonlabeled, and mixed. Some C6 cells were cultured in
BrdU-supplemented serum-containing medium for 3 consecutive days. The
final concentration of BrdUrd was 3 Ag/mL. These cells were referred to as
BrdU-labeled cells. The BrdUrd nonlabeled cells were cultured under the
same conditions except for the supplement of BrdU. The BrdU-labeled and
nonlabeled cells were harvested. A single-cell suspension was prepared for
both types of cells in serum-free medium with a density of 4  104 cells/mL.
For the mixed group, 2.5 mL BrdU-labeled cells and 2.5 mL nonlabeled cells
were plated together on the 25-cm2 culture plate. For the labeled and
nonlabeled groups, 5 mL cell suspension was seeded separately on each
plate. When the glioma spheres had expanded into hundreds of cells after
3 days, they were transferred to six-well plates containing poly-L-lysine–
coated glass coverslips. After attaching to the coverslips, the spheres were
fixed and immunostained for BrdUrd to determine the percentage of
BrdUrd+ cells in the spheres.
Immunocytochemistry. Immunostaining was done as described
previously (19–21), with some modification. Briefly, the cells attached to
the coverslips were washed thrice with PBS and fixed using 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS solution for 30 min. The cells were then
permeabilized with cold 0.5% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room
temperature and washed with cold PBS. PBS supplemented with 10% FBS
and 5% nonfat milk was used as a blocking solution (30 min, 37jC). After
removal of the blocking solution, the cells were incubated at 4jC overnight
in primary mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or goat anti-CD133 polyclonal antibody
(1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing with PBS, the cells were
incubated at 37jC for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase–labeled
secondary goat anti-mouse or rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies, respectively.
The cells were then stained with diaminobenzidine, counterstained with
hematoxylin to visualize the cell nuclei, and examined under a microscope.
Triton X-100 treatment was canceled in immunostaining for CD133.
Additionally, for immunostaining for BrdUrd incorporated into the genome,
the cells were incubated in 1 N HCl for 30 min at 95jC, followed by washing
with PBS before blocking.

Growth curve. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was done to determine the growth curves of the C6
cells cultured in both serum-containing and serum-free medium. C6 cells
were dissociated, adjusted to a density of 1,000 cells/mL, and seeded into
seven 96-well microplates (180 AL per well). Half of the cells (48 wells in
each microplate) were cultured with serum-containing medium, and the
other half were cultured with serum-free medium. A MTT assay was done
daily (one microplate each time) from the second to the eighth day of
incubation. The procedure was as follows. Briefly, 20 AL MTT (5 mg/mL)
was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 h. The culture
medium was then removed, and 150 AL DMSO was added to each well. After
shaking thoroughly for 10 min, the absorbance of each well was read in an
enzyme immunoassay instrument at a wavelength of 570 nm. Because
absorbance is in proportion to the number of living cells in a sample,
the MTT assay reflects the extent of cell proliferation. Growth curves were
drawn according to the absorbance.
Purification of CD133 cells. To determine whether CD133 cells in
the C6 line possessed the characteristics of cancer stem cells, we eliminated
the CD133+ cells from the C6 cell line based on the cytotoxic effect of
complement activated by the immune complex. Goat anti-CD133 polyclonal
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to C6 cells at a dilution of
1:200. After incubation at 37jC for 2 h, fresh guinea pig serum containing
complement was added to the cells at 20% volume. After incubation at 37jC
for another 4 h, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium. Then,
immunocytochemistry was done to verify the purity of the resultant
CD133 cells, which were subsequently tested for the capability for selfrenewal and tumorigenicity, following the methods described above.
Effect of Hoechst 33342 on cancer stem cells. Previously, it was
reported that only SP C6 cells are cancer stem cells (14). However, the
possibility that Hoechst 33342 staining itself may lead to a false conclusion
was not excluded. Because Hoechst 33342 is cytotoxic (22–25), it may
interfere with the clonogenicity of stem cells. Thus, to determine whether
Hoechst 33342 treatment could cause differences in results, C6 cells were
incubated with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) at a concentration of 5 Ag/mL for
2 h at 37jC as described in ref. (14), collected by centrifugation, resuspended in serum-containing Hoechst 33342-free medium, and finally seeded
in 96-well plates. Clonogenic and tumorigenic analyses of Hoechst 33342–
treated cells were done as described above. Control cells were prepared
similarly without Hoechst 33342 staining.
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as the mean F SD. Student’s
t tests or m2 tests were used where appropriate. P < 0.05 was accepted as
statistically significant.

Results
Most C6 cells are clonogenic and tumorigenic. In the serial
clonogenic analysis, 67 clones, each consisting of 300 to 500 cells,
grew out of the 67 original single cells in the serum-containing
medium after 2 weeks. The clone formation rate was 100%. The
primary clones were dissociated and plated into 96-well microplates to generate subclones. The subclone formation rate was
99.6%, with 464 subclones from 466 single cells. Then, 67
representative subclones were expanded and injected into nude
mice to test the subclone tumorigenicity. After 10 days, a s.c. tumor
was observed at each of the 67 injection sites. Typical morphologic
characteristics of glioma (26), such as marked cellular and nuclear
pleomorphism, excessive cell division, coagulation necrosis, and
microvascular hyperplasia, were evident in the tumor tissue
sections (Fig. 1A). As expected, most of the glioma cells stained
GFAP positive (Fig. 1B).
In the serum-free medium, only 46 clones formed from the 73
single cells after 2 weeks. The clone formation rate was 63.0%.
Interestingly, when the clone reached about 1,000 cells after 4 weeks,
it ceased expanding, even if sufficient, fresh, serum-free medium
was supplied (Fig. 1C). However, once the serum-free medium

Figure 1. Clonogenic and tumorigenic capacity of C6 cells. A, the xenograft tumor initiating from a C6 subclone exhibited morphologic characteristics of glioma,
including marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, excessive cell division, coagulation necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia (magnification, 200).
B, immunohistochemical staining indicated that most glioma cells in the xenograft tumor were GFAP positive (magnification, 200). C, C6 clones in serum-free

was replaced with serum-containing medium, the quiescent clones
continued to expand (Fig. 1D). The 27 single cells that were
incapable of generating clones remained quiescent but viable in the
serum-free medium for at least 3 weeks; these began to divide
once the medium was supplemented with 10% serum and
eventually formed a typical tumorigenic clone. Thus, most C6 cells
could generate clones that were capable of self-renewal and tumor
generation, as long as they were cultured in serum-containing
medium.
We prepared CD133 cells by depleting the C6 line of CD133+
cells. The resultant population was verified immunocytochemically
to be pure CD133 cells (Fig. 2A), which were then examined for
their ability to generate tumorigenic clones. Interestingly, 42 clones
formed from the 43 CD133 single cells. All of these clones also
generated gliomas in nude mice. Moreover, the descendants of
the CD133 cells were a mixture of both CD133 and CD133+ C6
cells (Fig. 2A).
Hoechst 33342 inhibited the clonogenicity of C6 cells. C6
cells were incubated in Hoechst 33342–containing medium for
2 h and cultured in 96-well plates in serum-containing medium.
Only 7 of the 55 wells containing a single cell generated a clone
after 2 weeks. These clones were confirmed to be tumorigenic
in vivo. The clone formation rate was 12.7%, which was significantly

lower than that of the control (100%). Morphologically, many cells
in the clones seemed fragmentary; even the viable cells exhibited a
less vigorous status than the control clonal cells. Moreover, the
average number of cells in clones of the Hoechst 33342–treated
group was 26, whereas that of the control was 315 (Fig. 2B).
The glioma sphere generated in serum-free medium was not
a clone. The BrdUrd incorporation analysis revealed that the
BrdUrd labeling index (LI) of the mixed group was about half that
of the BrdU-labeled group (mixed group: 47.6% versus labeled
group: 97.2%, P < 0.01). If the glioma sphere generated in the
serum-free medium were a cell clone, f50% of the spheres in the
mixed group would consist of pure BrdUrd cells. However, all
glioma spheres in the mixed group consisted of both labeled and
nonlabeled cells, indicating that the spheres were a mixture of
more than one clone (Fig. 2C). This finding is consistent with a
recent report (27) that showed that neurospheres were highly
motile structures prone to fuse even under ostensibly ‘‘clonal’’
culture conditions.
If only a rare fraction of stem cells contributes to the formation
of a glioma sphere, there must be three destinies for the original
non–stem cells: die, persist without involvement in sphere
formation, or proliferate in a monolayer form. However, we seldom
found dead cells or debris in the serum-free cultures, which are

very common in primary cultures of neural stem cells. In fact, on
the third day after passage, almost all cells were involved in the
formation of floating spheres (Fig. 2D); neither a monolayer nor
quiescent single cells were observed. On the fifth day after passage,
the expanded sphere began to attach to the plate, and cells
gradually emigrated (Fig. 2D). After all the spheres were detached
and discarded, the leftover attached cells expanded and eventually
generated new spheres (Fig. 2D), which in turn would detach by
themselves and float again.
The gross population analysis provided another clue. Three days
after seeding, we collected all of the spheres in a serum-free culture
flask by centrifugation, dissociated them into a single-cell suspension, and counted the total number of cells as f5.2  105,
which was somewhat greater than the original number of cells at
f5.0  105.
Most C6 cells took part in the population expansion. The
MTT proliferation assay revealed that the growth curves of the
serum-containing and serum-free groups were similar in shape
(Fig. 3), although the absolute value of the serum-containing group

was much higher. Both groups exhibited an exponential growth
phase.
Cells in the exponential growth phase (5 days) were exposed to
3 Ag/mL BrdUrd for 1 h, cultured for another 6 h, and then fixed
and stained immunocytochemically for BrdUrd. The BrdUrd LI of
the serum-containing group was 19.4 F 2.2%, and that of the
serum-free group was 18.9 F 3.5% (P > 0.05). When the BrdUrd
exposure time was increased to 3 days, the LI of the serumcontaining group was 97.2 F 1.5%, and that of the serum-free
group was 98.4 F 1.1% (P > 0.05).

Discussion
The C6 glioma cell line has been used widely for decades.
Although it has been cultured in vitro for thousands of passages, its
tumorigenicity remains quite stable. Thus, it is logical to assume
that most cells in the line are tumorigenic. Without any
classification based on a specific marker, we simply did singlecell cloning culture of unfractionated C6 cells using routine

Figure 2. Results of clonal and population analyses. A, the C6 line was depleted of CD133+ cells by complement-dependent microcytoxicity. The resultant population
was verified immunocytochemically as pure CD133 cells. However, their descendants comprised both CD133+ (arrows ) and CD133 cells (magnification, 250).
B, clone originating from Hoechst 33342-treated cell contained much less cells than the control (26 versus 315 on average) after 2 wks. Many cells in the Hoechst
33342–treated clones seemed fragmentary; even the viable cells seemed to have a less vigorous status than in the control. C, results of BrdUrd incorporation
analysis. Immunocytochemistry indicated that 97.2% of cells in the labeled group were BrdUrd positive. About 47.6% of cells in the mixed group were BrdUrd positive.
All cells in the nonlabeled group were BrdUrd negative. D, most single C6 cells cultured in serum-free medium took part in the formation of tumorospheres. The
tumorospheres expanded and attached to the plate; many cells emigrated from the attached spheres. The emigrated cells proliferated and formed a monolayer, which in
turn generated new spheres.

procedures of end-point dilution and showed that in serumcontaining medium, every viable C6 cell could generate a selfrenewable clone, which could subsequently give rise to glioma
in vivo. Several definitions need to be clarified with reference to the
concept of cancer stem cells, including the meaning of the word
‘‘stem.’’ In the context of normal development, stem refers to
multipotentiality or a cell’s ability to give rise to multiple cell types
of a particular lineage. In the context of cancer, it defines the
tumor-forming ability of an undifferentiated cancer cell that might
express normal stem cell markers without necessarily exhibiting
other behaviors attributable to normal stem cells (2, 10, 28). It has
been proposed that a single cell capable of giving rise to a tumor of
its own origin in vivo should be termed a cancer stem cell (28, 29).
Therefore, most viable C6 cells are cancer stem cells, according to
this criterion. Consistent with this conclusion, purified CD133 C6
cells also generated tumorigenic clones, and the descendants of
CD133 cells contained both CD133 and CD133+ cells. Similarly,
the opinion that non-SP C6 cells are not stem cells is questionable.
Exposing C6 cells to Hoechst 33342 for 2 h severely affected their
clonogenicity and proliferation. The flow-cytometric procedure
may further harm the stained cells. It is reasonable to deduce that
SP cells free of Hoechst 33342 would be less affected than non-SP
cells. Therefore, the FACS process alone is sufficient to deprive
most non-SP cells of their stem cell nature and results in
differences in clonogenicity between SP and non-SP cells. However,
we have not shown definitely that non-SP C6 cells are clonogenic
and tumorigenic. Because the phenotype of the side population
involved a complex mechanism (12, 30), we were unable to prepare
pure and viable non-SP cells other than by using FACS.
However, the current prevailing opinion is that most C6 cells do
not possess tumorigenic capacity, and only about 1%, i.e., the socalled ‘‘stem cells,’’ retain unlimited self-renewal and tumorigenic
capacity (14, 15). There are several paradoxes to this idea, as listed
below.
The stem cells can perform both symmetrical and asymmetrical
cell division and give rise to both stem and non–stem cells (1). The
model in Fig. 4 illustrated that the cell line cannot maintain a rare
but stable subpopulation of stem cells unless the stem cells always
divide symmetrically. Otherwise, the proportion of stem cells would
decrease quickly and disappear. Actually, the model is based on two
premises. First, most C6 cells proliferate and take part in the
population expansion in vitro, as shown in our results. Second,
stem cells cycle at lower or equal speed compared with non–stem

www.aacrjournals.org

cells in the same culture because the stem cells are generally
quiescent. If the stem cells always divide symmetrically, from where
did the presumed non–stem cells originate?
In contrast to the stem cells, the non–stem cells are thought to
possess very limited self-renewal capacity (1). Thus, all descendants
of a non–stem cell will die within a given period. It follows logically
that the immortality of the C6 line would then lie in the rare stem
cell subpopulation. However, it is not clear how many times the
non–stem cell and its daughter cells could divide before dying. If
four times, all of the parent ‘‘non–stem cells’’ and their descendants
would have died within a passage of 7 days. If eight times, then at
least half of the population would have died within a passage of
7 days. However, we never found great cell losses in the C6 cultures
unless they had been contaminated.
Another paradox is that the proportion of stem cells in the C6
line (0.4%; ref. 14) is lower than that in glioma specimens (3–5%,
ref. 18; 1–25%, ref. 9). The establishment of the glioma cell line
involved successive subcloning to achieve a highly homogeneous
tumorigenic cell population. It is difficult to imagine that this
purification process did not increase the proportion of stem cells.
Previous studies reported that conditions such as attachment,
serum-containing medium, and withdrawal of mitogens (EGF/
bFGF) were essential to induce cancer stem cells to differentiate
into committed non–stem cells (18). Considering that the C6 cell
line has been cultured in the form of an attached monolayer in
serum-containing medium for several decades, how did the small
fraction of stem cells maintain their undifferentiated state under
this selection pressure? This is yet another paradox. These
controversies may arise from drawbacks in the definition,
identification, and isolation of cancer stem cells. In our opinion,
most C6 cells are cancer stem cells, which seldom give rise to
committed non–stem cells in both serum-containing and serumfree medium in vitro. These paradoxes were resolved in our
opinion.
Although many exceptions have been reported, CD133 is
generally considered a marker for stem cells, as is the ABC
transporter, which is mainly responsible for drug resistance in C6
SP cells (31). FACS based on Hoechst 33342–negative staining is
also a standard method for isolating stem cells from many sources.
CD133 and the ABC transporter are important for stem cells to
survive or maintain their primitive state in vivo (5, 14, 31–33),
but this is not the case for the C6 cell line. In the in vitro culture
system, there is no strong factor inducing the primitive cancer
stem cells to die or differentiate; otherwise, no stem cells would
remain in the line after decades. Thus, we deduce that in the
absence of selection pressure, the expression of CD133 and ABCG2
is likely altered in the glioma cells, without the loss of their
capability for self-renewal, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity.
Although this hypothesis remains to be examined, we think it is
likely the case, considering the marked phenotypic and genotypic
differences between primary human tumor-derived tumor stem
cells and the established glioma cell lines (4, 34, 35).
Serum-free medium containing mitogens (EGF and/or bFGF) is
reported to selectively favor the proliferation of cancer stem cells
rather than nontumorigenic cancer cells (7, 8, 18). We showed that
most C6 cells proliferated in both serum-free and serum-containing
medium, although at different velocities. If serum-free medium has
a selective effect on cancer stem cells, most C6 cells have been
selected. In the serum-free medium, the status of living cells varied
between a floating sphere and an attached monolayer. Therefore,
it is illogical to assume that cancer stem cells merely take the

appearance of a floating sphere because differentiation is generally
irreversible. In fact, attachment is very common in serum-free
culture, especially when the spheres become too large to remain in
suspension. The suspension or attachment status did not seem
to distinguish different populations with different capabilities for
self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Furthermore, only in the serumcontaining medium could every viable single C6 cell give rise to a
clone. The serum-free medium was sometimes insufficient to
stimulate clone formation and individual cell expansion.

capable of giving rise to a glioma in vivo. Serum-free medium was
not necessary for the generation of a cancer stem cell clone. In this
line, the CD133 cells also possessed a cancer stem cell nature.
Moreover, we showed that Hoechst 33342 is harmful to the
clonogenicity and proliferation of single C6 cells. Therefore, the
non-SP cells may be deprived of their stem cell characteristics in
the process of Hoechst 33342 staining and FACS.

In contrast to several previous studies, we found that the C6
glioma cell line is composed mainly of cancer stem cells. In serumcontaining medium, every viable C6 cell generated a clone that was
