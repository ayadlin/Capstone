Abstract
Inhibition of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) can
increase the efficacy of other cancer therapeutics, but the
cellular mechanism is incompletely understood. We examined the cellular effects on tumor vasculature of a novel DNA
oligonucleotide aptamer (AX102) that selectively binds
PDGF-B. Treatment with AX102 led to progressive reduction
of pericytes, identified by PDGF receptor B, NG2, desmin, or
A-smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity, in Lewis lung
carcinomas. The decrease ranged from 35% at 2 days, 63%
at 7 days, to 85% at 28 days. Most tumor vessels that lacked
pericytes at 7 days subsequently regressed. Overall tumor
vascularity decreased 79% over 28 days, without a corresponding decrease in tumor size. Regression of pericytes and
endothelial cells led to empty basement membrane sleeves,
which were visible at 7 days, but only 54% remained at
28 days. PDGF-B inhibition had a less pronounced effect on
pancreatic islet tumors in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice, where
pericytes decreased 47%, vascularity decreased 38%, and
basement membrane sleeves decreased 21% over 28 days.
Taken together, these findings show that inhibition of PDGFB signaling can lead to regression of tumor vessels, but the
magnitude is tumor specific and does not necessarily retard
tumor growth. Loss of pericytes in tumors is an expected
direct consequence of PDGF-B blockade, but reduced tumor
vascularity is likely to be secondary to pericyte regression.

Introduction
Endothelial cells secrete platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) and pericytes (mural cells) express PDGF receptor h (PDGFR-h).
This relationship is important for recruitment of pericytes to blood
vessels during development (1–3). Mice lacking PDGF-B or PDGFRh have blood vessels with few pericytes, develop an abnormal
vasculature, and die in late gestation (4–6). Pericytes have
important roles in maintaining the microvasculature, including

contributions to blood vessel maturation and stabilization, normal
endothelial cell function, and blood flow regulation (5, 7–10).
PDGF-B is also integral to pericyte and endothelial cell interactions
in tumors. Tumors engineered to overexpress PDGF-B have
increased pericyte density associated with tumor vessels (11, 12).
Moreover, inhibition of PDGFR-h signaling can loosen, detach, or
even eliminate pericytes from tumor vessels (11, 13–17).
In addition to the direct effects that inhibition of PDGFR-h
signaling has on pericytes, there is an intricate association between
pericytes and endothelial cells. Previous reports describe paracrine
regulation of growth factors such as PDGF-B from endothelial cells
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from pericytes
(15, 18). Thus, regression of pericytes may affect vessels. It is still
unclear whether pericyte presence protects tumor vessels from
regression or whether removal of pericytes makes tumor vessels
vulnerable to regression.
The role of PDGF inhibition on tumor growth is incompletely
understood. PDGF inhibition alone has no effect on some tumor
models (14, 19), whereas it reduces tumor growth in others (20).
Nonetheless, PDGF inhibitors enhance the effects of antiangiogenic
inhibitors (14) and chemotherapeutics on tumor growth (19, 21).
Most of the agents used to study PDGFR-h inhibition are
nonspecific. Thus, questions remain about the direct therapeutic
benefit that is attributable to targeting PDGF-B in tumors (22).
Studies using PDGF-B retention motif–deficient mice (11),
PDGF-B aptamer (19), or PDGFR-h antibodies (16) showed pericyte reduction, enlargement of tumor vessels, decreased tumor
interstitial pressure, and increased endothelial cell apoptosis,
but no apparent reduction in tumor vascularity was observed
(11, 16, 19).
The present study sought to use a novel and specific PDGF-B
inhibitor to obtain a more complete understanding of the cellular
effects of selective PDGF-B blockade. DNA aptamer AX102, which
blocks the action of PDGF-B, was used in two murine tumor
models, spontaneous islet tumors in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice
(RIP-Tag2 tumors) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC tumors).
Aptamers are backbone-modified ssDNA or RNA oligonucleotides
that form well-defined three-dimensional shapes and bind to target
proteins with high affinity and specificity (23). AX102 is a modified
version of the DNA aptamer NX1975/ARC126 (19, 24) that is highly
selective for PDGF-B. Experiments focused on the effects of AX102
on pericytes, endothelial cells, and tumor vascular integrity. Our
studies revealed that inhibition of PDGF-B signaling by AX102
rapidly reduced pericyte coverage of tumor vessels. Removal of
pericytes subsequently caused regression of vessels. Basement
membrane sleeves also disappeared. Tumor vessels that survived
28 days of treatment had tight pericyte coverage and a normalized
phenotype.

PDGF-B Aptamer Reduces Pericytes

Materials and Methods
Aptamer synthesis. AX102 is a 34-nucleotide aptamer modified on the 5¶
terminus with a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol moiety to reduce renal filtration
and prolong plasma half-life. The 3¶ terminus was modified with an
inverted-dT cap. The nucleotide core sequence of AX102 is 5¶-NH2-dC-dCdC-dA-dG-dG-dC-T-dA-dC-mG-HEG-dC-dG-T-dA-mG-dA-mG-dC-dA-mUmC-mA-HEG-T-dG-dA-T-mC-dC-T-mG-mG-mG-3¶dT-3¶. AX104 is an inactive variant with the following sequence: 5¶-dC-dA-dG-fC-mG-{fU}-dA-fCmG-HEG-dC-dG-T-dA-dC-dC-mG-dA-T-fU-fC-mA-HEG-T-dG-dA-dA-dG-fCfU-mG-3¶dT-3¶. Abbreviations for the aptamer core sequence represent
backbone modifications directed to the 2¶-ribose position of the nucleoside
such that dC, dA, dG, and dT signify 2¶-deoxycytidine, 2¶-deoxyadenosine, 2¶deoxyguanosine, and 2¶-deoxythymidine, respectively; mC, mA, mG, and mU
signify 2¶-O-methoxycytidine, 2¶-O-methoxyadenosine, 2¶-O-methoxyguanosine, and 2¶-O-methoxyuridine, respectively; dT signifies 5¶-5¶ inverted dT;
HEG signifies hexaethylene glycol; and fU and fC signify 2¶-fluorocytidine
and 2¶-fluorouridine, respectively. Aptamers were synthesized as described
in the Supplementary Methods.
In vitro assays of functional PDGF-B–binding aptamer. Aptamers
were tested for effect on PDGF-driven proliferation of 3T3 mouse
fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) using the methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) cell proliferation kit (Sigma). Cells were plated (3,000
per well) in 96-well plates 1 day before the start of the assay in DMEM
with 10% FCS. Cells were washed with 100 AL of DMEM and incubated for
3 days in 75-AL DMEM/0.8% FCS containing various concentrations of
PDGF-B aptamer and human, rat, or mouse PDGF-B to a final
concentration of 2 nmol/L. On day 3, 10-AL MTT was added to each
well. After 1.5 h, the medium was removed, cells were lysed with 200 AL
isopropanol, and absorbance was measured with a SpectraMax Plus plate
reader (Molecular Devices).
The in vitro binding affinity and specificity of the PDGF aptamer were
evaluated by nitrocellulose filter-binding assay. Recombinant human and
rodent PDGF-BB and its various human isoforms were purchased from
R&D Systems or from Biosource. Recombinant human VEGF165 was from
R&D Systems. Binding reactions were prepared with radiolabeled AX102
(V10 pmol/L) and increasing concentrations (0.001–60 nmol/L) of
recombinant PDGF or VEGF in PBS (Invitrogen) containing 0.1 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin (EMD Biosciences) and 0.01 mg/mL tRNA (Sigma).
Nitrocellulose filtration and analysis was done essentially as described (25)
to obtain estimates of the dissociation constant (K D). The pharmacokinetic
analysis and pharmacodynamic assay were done as described in
Supplementary Methods.
Animals and treatment. LLC and RIP-Tag2 tumor models were used
essentially as described (26). LLC tumors were allowed to grow for 5 to 7 days
before treatment. During the treatment, LLC tumor volume was measured
every other day using calipers and applying the formula [volume = 0.52 
(width)2  (length)] as previously described (14). Aptamer AX102, AX104, or
their vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was injected at a dose of 0.5 to 50 mg/kg i.p. once
daily for 1 to 28 days. These experimental procedures were approved by
the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Fixation by vascular perfusion and immunohistochemistry. Following treatment, mice were fixed by vascular perfusion and the tumors were
processed for and stained by immunohistochemistry as previously
described (26). Trachea vasculature was analyzed according to Supplementary Methods. Endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane were
identified by staining sections with combinations of two or three primary
antibodies. Endothelial cells were labeled with CD31; pericytes with asmooth muscle actin (a-SMA), desmin, NG2 proteoglycan or PDGFR-h; and
basement membrane with type IV collagen, laminin, or entactin/nidogen, as
described in detail in the Supplementary Methods.
Imaging and analysis. Specimen were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot
fluorescence microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal
microscope. Area densities were calculated from digital fluorescence
microscopic images using an empirically determined threshold value of
30 to 50 essentially as previously described (26).

Overall pericyte-endothelial cell colocalization. As an estimate of
pericyte coverage, the amount of colocalization of pericytes (PDGFR-h) and
endothelial cells (CD31) was measured on 20-Am sections of LLC tumors.
Digital images of the red channel (PDGFR-h) and green channel (CD31)
were captured separately under a Axiophot fluorescence microscope (10
objective, 1 Optovar; ref. 27). The Colocalization plug-in function of
ImageJ was used to identify pixels that had fluorescence intensity in both
red and green channels equal to or greater than a threshold value, ranging
from 30 to 45 in different experiments. Amount of colocalization was
expressed as a percentage calculated from the number of pixels with abovethreshold CD31 staining that colocalized with above-threshold PDGFR-h
staining divided by the total number of above-threshold pixels in the CD31
image.
Pericyte-endothelial cell colocalization in individual vessels. Pericyte coverage was measured in fluorescence microscopic images of 100
randomly selected blood vessels in 20-Am sections of LLC tumors stained
for CD31 and PDGFR-h. Individual vessels were outlined with the freehand
selection in ImageJ, and the percentage of PDGFR-h pixels that colocalized
with CD31 pixels was determined in the same manner as overall
colocalization. After calculating the frequency distribution of values for
100 vessels, the number of vessel profiles per bin was scaled for the vascular
density of the experimental group and expressed as vessel profiles per
square millimeter of section.
Transmission electron microscopy. Mice implanted with LLC tumors
were prepared for and examined by transmission electron microscopy as
previously described (26, 28).
Statistics. The significance of differences between groups was assessed
by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni-Dunn or Fisher’s post hoc tests. Multiple
comparisons were used where appropriate. Values are expressed as mean F
SE. N = 4 to 5 mice per group. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Affinity and specificity of AX102 for PDGF-B. The selectivity of
AX102 for different PDGF subtypes was tested by nitrocellulose
filtration assay. AX102 bound with highest affinity to PDGF-BB
homodimer (K D = 0.046 F 0.0037 nmol/L) and PDGF-AB
heterodimer (K D = 0.092 F 0.0065 nmol/L). The affinity for PDGFAA (K D = 2.2 F 0.43 nmol/L) was only 2% of that for PDGF-BB,
whereas little or no binding of PDGF-CC or VEGF165 was detected
(Fig. 1A-i). Binding measurements showed that AX102 had similar
affinity for PDGF-BB from human (K D = 0.046 F 0.0037 nmol/L),
rat (K D = 0.045 F 0.0035 nmol/L), and mouse (K D = 0.061 F 0.0053
nmol/L; Fig. 1A-ii). Pharmacokinetic studies in mice indicated a
half-life of 6 to 10 h (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Noncompartmental
estimates for clearance ranged from 10 to 20 mL/h/kg, whereas
those for V ss ranged from 73 to 104 mL/kg. The presence of
active aptamer in plasma samples was verified by a competitive
nitrocellulose filtration assay. Although AX102 seemed to lose
some binding activity at 24 h, the concentration of AX102 in each
plasma sample determined by this method was similar to that
determined by OliGreen (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 29).
The in vivo activity of AX102 was assayed in implanted LLC
tumors in mice using pericytes immunoreactive for a-SMA as the
readout (28). After 7-day treatment with vehicle or AX104, blood
vessels in these tumors had abundant a-SMA–positive pericytes
(Fig. 1B-i). AX102 caused a dose-dependent reduction in a-SMA
(Fig. 1B-ii). AX102 had no effect at 0.5 mg/kg, but it reduced a-SMA–
positive pericytes by 60% at 2 mg/kg, 80% at 10 mg/kg, and 82% at
50 mg/kg (Fig. 1B-iii). No adverse effects were detected at any dose.

vessels in LLC tumors of vehicle-treated mice had abundant

dramatically reduced a-SMA immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C-ii). In fact,
a-SMA–positive pericytes were reduced by 55% at 1 day and 84%
at 7 days. Prolonging the treatment to 28 days caused no further
reductions (Fig. 1C-iii).
Blood vessels in untreated RIP-Tag2 tumors had even more
abundant a-SMA-positive pericytes (Fig. 1D-i). AX102 reduced
a-SMA immunoreactivity in RIP-Tag2 tumors, but the changes were
smaller than in LLC tumors (Fig. 1D-ii). In RIP-Tag2 tumors, a-SMA
immunoreactivity was reduced by 28% at 7 days and 47% at 14 and
28 days (Fig. 1D-iii).
The reduction in a-SMA immunoreactivity on tumor vessels
could reflect a loss of pericytes, a decrease in a-SMA expression, or

both. This issue was addressed by comparing a-SMA staining with
staining of LLC tumors for three other pericyte markers, NG2,
PDGFR-h, and desmin (Fig. 2A and B). Under baseline conditions,
the staining for all four markers was similar (Fig. 2A). After 1 day of
AX102, a-SMA immunoreactivity was reduced by 55% and NG2 by
69%, but PDGFR-h was reduced only by 13% and desmin only by
26%. After 7 days, however, all four pericyte markers were reduced
by 63% to 89% (Fig. 2B).
Differential effects of AX102 on pericyte markers were further
examined by comparing in the same sections immunoreactivities
of NG2, the marker showing the greatest reduction, and PDGFR-h,
the marker having the least reduction. Both markers colocalized in

most pericytes under baseline conditions (Fig. 2C-i); after AX102
for 1 day, some cells expressed PDGFR-h but lacked NG2 (Fig. 2Cii). After 7 days, many tumor vessels had neither marker (Fig. 2Ciii), consistent with absence of pericytes. Examination of tumor
vessels in LLC tumors by transmission electron microscopy
confirmed the presence of pericytes under baseline conditions
(Fig. 2D-i) and the reduction in pericytes after AX102 for 7 days
(Fig. 2D-ii). Measurements of electron micrographs showed an 84%
reduction in endothelial cell perimeter covered by pericytes.
Regression of tumor vessels after pericyte loss. Because
AX102 had such a large effect on tumor pericytes, we examined the
vascularity of LLC and RIP-Tag2 tumors after treatment. Compared

www.aacrjournals.org

with the baseline vascularity reflected by CD31 immunoreactivity,
no reduction in tumor vessels was evident after 1 or 2 days of
AX102, but longer treatments led to increasing loss of tumor
vessels: 31% reduction at 4 days, 47% reduction at 7 days, and 79%
reduction at 28 days in LLC tumors (Fig. 3A).
AX102 had smaller but significant effects on the vascularity of
RIP-Tag2 tumors, which were densely vascular under baseline
conditions. Tumor vascularity decreased during treatment with
AX102 in a time-dependent manner: 14% reduction at 7 days, 27%
reduction at 14 days, and 38% reduction at 28 days (Fig. 3B).
Tumor vessels that remained after AX102 were changed. Most
pericytes in untreated LLC and RIP-Tag2 tumors were detached or

loosely associated with the tumor blood vessels (Fig. 3C-i and iii).
After 7 or 28 days of AX102 treatment, although the pericytes and
tumor vessels were reduced in number, the remaining tumor
vessels had closely associated pericytes (Fig. 3C-ii and iv).
To investigate whether the loss of pericytes led to regression of
tumor vessels, we compared the relative abundance of pericytes
(PDGFR-h) and endothelial cells (CD31) in the same sections of
LLC tumors. Under baseline conditions, tumor vessels had dense
pericyte coverage; about half of the CD31 immunoreactivity
colocalized with PDGFR-h (Fig. 4A-i and B). After AX102 for
7 days, PDGFR-h was reduced much more than CD31, and
colocalization was reduced to 19%, indicative of reduced pericyte
coverage (Fig. 4A-ii and B). From 7 to 28 days, the progressive loss

of tumors vessels (CD31) outpaced further decreases in PDGFR-h.
By 28 days, CD31 and PDGFR-h immunoreactivities were decreased
equally, and about half of CD31 colocalized with PDGFR-h (Fig. 4Aiii and B). These changes are consistent with a rapid loss of
pericytes during the first week and subsequent loss of endothelial
cells, with both decreasing f80% over 28 days (Figs. 1C and 3A).
The extent of pericyte coverage varied from vessel to vessel in
LLC tumors (Fig. 4C). To examine if the loss of pericyte coverage
led to a reduction of tumor vessels, we compared the distribution
of CD31 and PDGFR-h colocalization on individual vessels.
Measurements showed that the amount of colocalization was
40% to 90% for most vessels under baseline conditions (Fig. 4D,
top), but after AX102 for 7 days, 80% of vessels had <40% coverage

cell colocalization in tumor vessels after
AX102. A, confocal microscopic images

the colocalization was reduced, and many
vessels lacked PDGFR-h (ii ). After 28 d,
endothelial cell staining decreased to

and 41% had <10% coverage (Fig. 4D, middle). Surprisingly, this
abundance of tumor vessels with few or no pericytes was transient.
After treatment for 28 days, pericyte coverage spanned the range
from none to complete; only 42% had <40% coverage and 9% had
<10% coverage (Fig. 4D, bottom).
The effect of AX102 was also analyzed in normal blood vessels by
examining the microvasculature of the trachea (30). Despite a
moderate reduction of pericyte coverage, capillaries did not
undergo noticeable regression, nor did empty sleeves of vascular
basement membrane appear, indicative of regressing capillaries
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

membrane (31), we asked whether AX102-induced loss of pericytes
and blood vessels was accompanied by corresponding changes in
basement membrane. Under baseline conditions, tumor vessels
were enveloped by type IV collagen immunoreactive basement
membrane. In LLC and RIP-Tag2 tumors, treatment with AX102 led
to time-dependent reductions in basement membrane. In LLC
tumors treated with AX102, type IV collagen was unchanged at
1 day, but was reduced by 12% at 7 days and by 54% at 28 days
(Fig. 5A). The network of type IV collagen was more dense and
complex in RIP-Tag2 tumors. Treatment with AX102 caused a
smaller but significant reduction in type IV collagen (11% at 7 days
and 21% at 28 days) in RIP-Tag2 tumors (Fig. 5B).
In both RIP-Tag2 and LLC tumors, the reduction in type IV
collagen after AX102 was significantly less than the reduction in

pericytes. To determine whether type IV collagen was representative of other basement membrane proteins, we examined nidogen
and laminin in the same or sequential sections and found
comparable amounts and distributions in LLC tumors (Fig. 5C).
Area density measurements showed that the three markers
decreased to a similar extent after AX102 (Fig. 5C-iv).
Effect of AX102 on tumor growth. Treatment with AX102 did
not have an antitumor effect. Until day 16, the growth of LLC
tumors treated with AX102 was similar to vehicle-treated tumors.
Following longer treatments, AX102-treated tumors grew significantly larger than vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 6). The effect of
AX102 on tumor growth of RIP-Tag2 tumor was not analyzed
because these tumors are orthotopic.

Discussion
The goal of the present study was to determine the cellular
effects of selective inhibition of PDGF-B by the DNA oligonucleotide aptamer AX102 on the vasculature of tumors. Experiments
revealed that AX102 rapidly reduced the pericyte coverage of tumor
vessels. In LLC tumors, changes in pericytes were evident within
24 h. Immunoreactivity for some pericyte markers was reduced at
1 day; overall pericyte number was reduced by 35% at 2 days, 63%
at 7 days, and 85% at 28 days. Pericyte loss predisposed the tumor
vessels to regression. Tumor vascularity was decreased by 31% at
4 days, 47% at 7 days, and 79% at 28 days. Pericyte-free tumor
vessels were abundant at 7 days but largely disappeared with
further treatment. By 28 days, most surviving tumor vessels had a

AX102 for 28 d led to a reduction in type IV

that after AX102, the total amount of type
IV collagen was essentially unchanged at
1 d, but was reduced by 12% at 7 d, and by
54% at 28 d (iii ). B, in vehicle-treated
RIP-Tag2 tumors, most type IV collagen
was associated with pericytes (i), but after
AX102, type IV collagen was reduced by
11% at 7 d and by 21% at 28 d (ii and iii ).

decreased more rapidly and to a greater
extent than type IV collagen. C, staining

more normal appearance. Empty basement membrane sleeves were
reduced in amount but not eliminated. AX102 had qualitatively
similar but smaller effects on RIP-Tag2 tumors. Taken together,
these results show that inhibition of PDGF-B results in pericyte loss
followed by pruning of pericyte-free tumor blood vessels. At
4 weeks, the tumor vasculature and empty basement membrane
sleeves were more sparse, but surviving tumor vessels had a more
normal phenotype.
Selectivity of PDGF-B inhibition by AX102. AX102 had
selective binding for PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB, but not PDGF-AA,
PDGF-CC, or VEGF165. The scrambled version (AX104) had no such
binding. The affinity for the heterodimer PDGF-AB was half of the
affinity of the homodimer PDGF-BB. This highlights the high
selectivity of AX102 for PDGF-B. AX102 had similar affinities for
mouse, rat, and human PDGF-B; thus, it may be used across
species. Pharmacokinetic studies of AX102 showed a half-life in
blood of 6 to 10 h, which justified daily dosing. The mean observed
Vss was approximately equal to the expected blood volume of a
mouse (32), indicating that for healthy mice with normal
vasculature, the aptamer is not widely distributed outside the
vasculature. The observed estimates for clearance represented only
1% to 2% of the glomerular filtration rate for mice (32), suggesting
that renal elimination does not play a major role in the overall
clearance of intact AX102 from plasma. Similar PDGF-B binding
aptamers improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in
tumors, decrease ocular neovascularization, and ameliorate
glomerulonephritis in experimental models (19, 24, 33). AX102,
however, has a greater affinity for PDGF-B than previously used
aptamers (24, 34).
Reduced pericyte coverage of tumor vessels after PDGF-B
inhibition. Inhibition of PDGFR-h signaling by genetic mutation,
anti-receptor antibodies, and small-molecule receptor tyrosine
kinase blockers reduce pericyte coverage of blood vessels in tumors
(11, 13–16). Because pericytes respond to PDGFR-h signaling
inhibition, pericytes were used as a reference for assessing effects
of treatment. Pericytes are present on >97% of vessels in LLC and
RIP-Tag2 tumors (28). Different human tumors have strikingly
variable pericyte coverage (35). The differences in expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

immunohistochemical markers used for pericyte identification
complicate this determination as none of the markers used to
identify pericytes are expressed by all pericytes (11, 16, 28).
Therefore, absence of a single marker may not indicate the absence
of pericytes. For this reason, we used four different pericyte
markers: two cytoskeleton proteins, a-SMA and desmin, and two
membrane proteins, NG2 and PDGFR-h (36, 37).
Measurements showed that the four pericyte markers had
different immunoreactivities in LLC tumors under baseline
conditions. NG2 was most abundant and desmin the least. These
differences may reflect a combination of different cellular
distributions of the marker proteins, levels of expression, antibody
affinities, or presence of multiple pericyte populations. After LLC
tumors were treated with AX102 for 1 day, NG2 and a-SMA were
reduced by >50%, desmin was reduced by 26%, and PDGFR-h was
unchanged. At 2 days, PDGFR-h was significantly reduced. At
7 days, all four markers were reduced by >60%, and by at least 80%
after 28 days. Electron microscopic studies confirmed the
reduction of pericytes at 7 days. We interpret these findings as
evidence that the reduction of markers may initially reflect variable
down-regulation of protein expression in pericytes, but after the
second day, most of the changes reflected loss of pericytes.
Regression of tumor vessels after pericyte loss. Pericytes play
an important role in blood vessel growth and maturation by
providing survival and stabilization signals for endothelial cells
(10, 18, 36, 38–40). Whereas pericyte loss may lead to endothelial
cell apoptosis, extensive regression of endothelial cells was not
observed in tumors after inhibition of PDGFR-h signaling (11, 16).
Imatinib (STI571, Gleevec), which targets PDGFRs and certain
other receptor tyrosine kinases, did not reduce vascular density
when given alone but did augment the effects of VEGF inhibitors
(14). Treatment of RIP-Tag2 tumors with anti–PDGFR-h antibody
for 3 weeks reduces pericytes, increases endothelial cell apoptosis,
and enlarges tumor vessels but does not seem to reduce tumor
vascular density (16). AX102 treatment of LLC and RIP-Tag2 tumors
elicited a robust effect on tumor vessels. These differences in
effects may be due to duration of inhibition, differences in tumor
models, different methods of PDGF inhibition, or varying methods
of analyzing tumor vessel density. We used methods that have
previously shown reductions in tumor vessels after VEGF inhibition
(26, 27, 30). In addition, we took advantage of the potent and
selective binding of PDGF-B by AX102 to assess the effect of
pericyte loss on endothelial cell viability in two very different
murine tumor models. After 7 to 28 days of AX102, blood vessel loss
was modest in RIP-Tag2 tumors but extensive in LLC tumors.
Accordingly, many tumor vessels lacked pericytes after 7 days of
AX102, but this vessel population was absent after 28 days of
treatment.
The regression of tumor vessels is likely not a direct effect of
PDGF inhibition. Tumor vessel regression was slower than pericyte
reduction. Whereas AX102 reduced tumor pericytes after 2 days,
tumor vessels were not affected until after 4 days of treatment.
Studies examining the effects of VEGF inhibition, which targets
tumor vessels, observed regression as early as 1 day (26). In
addition, PDGFR-a or PDGFR-h expression is absent in endothelial
cells (14). These results indicate that pericytes are necessary for
tumor vessel survival because reductions of f50% of tumor
pericytes lead to reductions in tumor vessels. Pericyte coverage
alone, however, cannot protect tumor vessels from regression.
Despite 97% of tumor vessels being covered by pericytes, VEGF
inhibition can eliminate tumor vessels without removing pericytes

(27, 28). This indicates that removal of pericyte coverage leads to
exposed tumor vessels, which may explain the enhanced effect of
combining inhibitors that target both tumor vessels and pericytes
(14, 41).
Despite the strong effect on tumor vasculature, AX102 had only
a modest effect (19% reduction) on pericyte coverage of normal
tracheal capillaries in adult mice. No regression of tracheal
capillaries was evident. These findings indicate that pericytes in
this vasculature have only modest dependence on PDGF-B and that
these capillaries can survive for 4 weeks after a small reduction in
pericyte coverage.
Regression of empty basement membrane sleeves. Blood
vessels in tumors are enveloped by basement membrane. This
provides a substrate for endothelial cell and pericyte attachment as
well as a storage site for VEGF and other growth factors (27, 42–44).
When tumor vessels regress after VEGF inhibition, empty sleeves of
basement membrane are left behind (26, 27). These sleeves provide
a scaffold for blood vessel regrowth after VEGF inhibition ends
(27). Inhibition of PDGF-B by AX102 for 28 days was accompanied
by loss of 54% of basement membrane sleeves in LLC tumor, but
this reduction was significantly less than the f80% loss of
pericytes and endothelial cells. Similarly, in RIP-Tag2 tumors, the
reduction in the empty sleeves at 28 days was less than the loss of
blood vessels. The time course of the reduction suggests that
AX102 reduces the basement membrane by eliminating pericytes
and endothelial cells, which contribute to the synthesis of the
basement membrane components (31). Although not eliminated,
the reductions in basement membrane sleeves may prevent or slow
vascular regrowth after cessation of AX102.
Differences between LLC and RIP-Tag2 tumors. Comparison
of effects of AX102 on pericytes, blood vessels, and basement
membrane revealed larger and more rapid effects on LLC tumors
than RIP-Tag2 tumors. The lower sensitivity of RIP-Tag2 tumors to
AX102 may reflect a lesser dependency on pericytes because VEGF
is highly expressed by the tumor cells (26, 45). Alternatively, the
greater reductions observed in LLC tumors may indicate a more
immature vasculature that greatly depends on PDGF and pericytes
for stabilization of newly formed vessels. This immaturity is
reflected by the differences in tumor vascularity whereby RIP-Tag2
tumors have a vessel area density of 55% and LLC tumors, 16%.
Nonetheless, treatment of RIP-Tag2 tumors with AX102 for 28 days
resulted in a 47% decrease in pericytes, a 38% decrease in blood
vessels, and a 21% decrease in basement membrane sleeves.
Normalization of tumor vessels by AX102. Unlike untreated
tumors where most of the blood vessels had loosely attached
pericytes (28), tumors treated with AX102 for 7 to 28 days had
blood vessels with pericytes tightly associated with endothelial
cells. Surviving tumor vessels had fewer sprouts, less branching,
and more uniform caliber. Whereas the normalized tumor vessels
may be the result of pruning vessels with loosely attached pericytes,
we cannot eliminate the possibility that tumor vessels go through a

gradual process that leads to this normalization. However, many
vessels in tumors treated for 7 days had few or no pericytes. This
population of bare vessels was eliminated with further treatment.
More efficient blood flow and drug delivery, attributed to
normalization of tumor vessels (46), may contribute to the
increased efficiency of chemotherapeutics or other agents administered in combination with inhibitors of PDGFR-h signaling
(14, 15, 19, 47).
Effect of AX102 on tumor growth. Despite reductions of
endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane, AX102 did
not reduce the growth of LLC tumors. Instead, beyond 16 days,
LLC tumors treated with AX102 were as large or even larger than
those treated with vehicle. The mechanism of the observed
increase in tumor volume remains to be determined. Contributing
factors may include (a) expanded tumor growth supported by
improved blood flow through normalized, albeit much less
numerous, tumor vessels; (b) reduced tumor cell death; (c)
impaired clearance of necrotic tumor tissue; or (d) increased
tumor edema due to greater plasma leakage or reduced fluid
clearance. Although not found in LLC tumors treated with AX102,
PDGF inhibition is efficacious in reducing growth of tumors that
overexpress PDGFR-h in stroma (20). Inhibition of PDGF also
augments the reduction in tumor growth and metastasis
produced by other inhibitors of angiogenesis (14, 15, 17),
chemotherapeutic agents (19, 21, 48), and irradiation (49).
In conclusion, experiments with aptamer AX102 highlight the
importance of PDGFR-h signaling in the structure, function, and
survival of the tumor vasculature. Many pericytes in LLC tumors
depend on PDGF-B for survival, with only 15% remaining after
PDGF-B is inhibited for 4 weeks. Fewer pericytes in RIP-Tag2
tumors are PDGF-B dependent, as reflected by persistence of 53%
after 4 weeks of PDGF-B inhibition. Loss of pericyte coverage leads
to loss of endothelial cells and regression of tumor vessels. This
leads to formation of empty basement membrane sleeves, which
eventually regress (Supplementary Fig. S3). Tumor vessels that
survive PDGF-B inhibition are more normal, which may improve
drug delivery to adjacent tumor cells despite reduced tumor
vascularity.
