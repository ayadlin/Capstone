ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the leading cause of treatment failure in cancer
chemotherapy. The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
particularly ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2, play a key role in mediating MDR by pumping
anticancer drugs out from cancer cells. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a second-generation
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) currently in phase
III clinical trial for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we found that
ceritinib remarkably enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in ABCB1 or
ABCG2 over-expressing cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Ceritinib significantly increased
the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin (DOX)
by inhibiting ABCB1 or ABCG2-mediated drug efflux in the transporters-overexpressing
cells. Mechanistically, ceritinib is likely a competitive inhibitor of ABCB1 and ABCG2
because it competed with [125I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin for photo affinity labeling of
the transporters. On the other hand, at the transporters-inhibiting concentrations,
ceritinib did not alter the expression level of ABCB1 and ABCG2, and phosphorylation
status of AKT and ERK1/2. Thus the findings advocate further clinical investigation
of combination chemotherapy of ceritinib and other conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs in chemo-refractory cancer patients.

into seven subfamilies (ABCA-ABCG) on the basis of
amino acid sequence similarities and phylogeny [2]. ABC
transporter can transport a wide range of chemothera­
peutic drugs including the anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids,
taxanes, and epipodophyllotoxins [3], and it is also a
transporter that effluxes molecularly targeted drugs such
as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Among them, the
ABC transporter subfamily B member1 (ABCB1/MDR1/
P-glycoprotein, P-gp), subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1/
MRP1) and subfamily G member 2(ABCG2/ BCRP)
are considered to be the most important transporters to
confer MDR to tumor cells. ABCB1 (MDR1/P-gp) was
the first eukaryotic ABC transporter identified that confers

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for many
malignant tumors. Unfortunately, cancer cells develop
multidrug resistance (MDR) to a variety of structurally
and functionally unrelated anticancer drugs, thus hindering
the otherwise successfully chemotherapy [1]. The most
common mechanism of MDR is the overexpression of
ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which actively
pump numerous chemotherapeutic drugs out from cancer
cells, thereby attenuating the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
agents. Up to now, 49 different ABC transporters have
been identified in the human genome, which are divided

MDR in cancer cells [4]. ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR) is the
first half transporter in the ABC transporter family, it has
been found in mitoxantrone (MX) selected human colon
carcinoma cell line S1-M1-80, so giving ABCG2 the name
of mitoxantrone resistant protein (MXR) [5]. ABCG2 can
actively efflux a wide variety of chemotherapeutic drugs
including organic anion conjugates, nucleoside analogs,
organic dyes, TKIs, anthracyclines, camptothecin-derived
indolocarbazole topoisomerase I inhibitors, methotrexate
and flavopiridols [6]. Interestingly, ABCG2 was also found
to be a determinant of side population (SP) cells that are
highly enriched in cancer stem cells [7]. Thus, targeting
ABCG2 in the tumor stem cells represents a promising and
novel strategy to eradicate the entire cancer cell population.
ABCC1 is a 190-kDa protein that was first discovered in
DOX resistant HL60/Adr and H69AR cell lines [8, 9]. Its
substrates include vinblastine (VLB), vincristine (VCR)
and so on. Therefore, inhibition of ABC transporters may
represent a promising strategy to circumvent MDR by
increasing intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic
drugs. Enormous effort has been devoted to the development
of ABC transporter inhibitors. To date, three generations of
MDR inhibitors have been developed, some of which are
currently under clinical trials to evaluate their usefulness in
circumventing anticancer drug resistance.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a new class
of molecular targeted chemotherapeutic drugs that
selectively kill cancer cells by blocking key oncogenic
pathways. Importantly, the recent discovery of potent and
specific inhibition of several ABC transporters by TKIs
has advocated their use as chemosensitizers to circumvent
MDR. Ceritinib (LDK378/Zykadia) is a clinically
approved second generation TKI specifically targeting
the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In preclinical
setting, ceritinib was found to be more potent than the first
generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib [10, 11]. It is indicated
for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive and
metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with disease progression,
or who are intolerant to crizotinib. In this study, we
investigated the effect of ceritinib on the circumvention of
MDR in vitro and in vivo.

ceritinib was chosen as a maximum concentration for
combination treatment with ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrate
anticancer drugs.

Ceritinib potentiated the cytotoxicity of
conventional chemotherapeutic agents in ABCB1
and ABCG2-overexpressing cells
The IC50 values of the anticancer drugs in sensitive
and resistant cells in the absence or presence of ceritinib
are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Ceritinib produced a
concentration-dependent decrease in the IC50 values of
doxorubicin and paclitaxel (both are ABCB1 substrates)
in KBv200 cells and MCF-7/adr cells but did not alter the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin which is not an ABCB1 substrate.
The similar results were observed in the stably transfected
HEK293/ABCB1, but not in the parental sensitive cells,
even at the maximum concentration used. Ceritinib also
significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone
and topotecan (ABCG2 substrate drugs) in ABCG2
overexpressing S1-M1-80 and transfected HEK293/
ABCG2-R2 cells, while there was also no obvious effect
on the parental S1 and HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. These
results suggest that ceritinib enhances the sensitivity
of ABCB1 and ABCG2 overexpressing MDR cells to
conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but has negligible
effect on their parental cell lines.

Ceritinib enhanced the efficacy of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents in ABCB1-mediated
MDR in nude mouse xenografts
An ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistant KBv200
cell xenograft model was established in nude mice to
evaluate whether ceritinib could reverse the resistance to
paclitaxel in vivo. We did not find significant difference in
tumor size between animals treated separately with saline,
ceritinib or paclitaxel. However, there was a significant
inhibition of tumor growth in the group with a combination
of ceritinib and paclitaxel compared with other groups (P
< 0.05; Figure 2). The mean weights of tumors excised
from mice were 1.91 ± 0.52, 1.63 ± 0.54, 1.60 ± 0.66, 0.99
± 0.44g for saline, paclitaxel, Ceritinib and combination
group, respectively. Furthermore, we did not observe
any death or apparent decrease in body weight in the
combination treatment group at the doses tested, suggesting
that the combination regimen did not increase toxicity.

Cell survival was performed by MTT assay as described in “Materials and Methods”. Data were shown as the
mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The fold reversal of
MDR (values given in parentheses) was calculated by dividing the IC50 value for cells with the anticancer agent in the
absence of Ceritinib by that obtained in the presence of Ceritinib.

**P < 0.01 significantly different from control group.

Ceritinib inhibited the efflux of DOX in MDR
cells overexpressing ABCB1

substrate of ABCB1 or ABCG2 could compete for [125I]IAAP labeling of the two transporters [12]. To further
ascertain the interaction of ceritinib with the substrate
binding sites of ABCB1 and ABCG2, we examined the
photo-labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP by
incubating membrane vesicles in the presence of various
concentrations of ceritinib. As showed in (Figure 5D, 5E),
ceritinib strongly inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of
ABCB1and ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP in a concentrationdependent manner. The results suggest that ceritinib
binds with high affinity to both the ABCB1 and ABCG2
substrate-binding sites.

Ceritinib increased intracellular accumulation of
DOX and Rho123 in ABCB1-overexpression MDR cells;
Next, we examined whether the increased accumulation
of anticancer agents was due to inhibition of efflux of
anticancer agents. The efflux of DOX over 2 h after an initial
drug accumulation was monitored and the result is shown
in Figure 5A. As expected, due to ABCB1 overexpression
in KBv200 cells, DOX retention dropped remarkably from
100% (0 h efflux) to about 46.4% (2 h efflux). The decrease
in DOX retention was much less in the parental KB cells
(69.4% retention at 2 h). Importantly, ceritinib (0.5 μM) was
found to significantly increase DOX retention (p < 0.05)
in KBv200 cells to 63.0% of the level attained at the 2 h
time point. The result shows that ceritinib inhibited drug
efflux of ABCB1 in KBv200 cells but did not influence
drug efflux in sensitive KB cells.

Ceritinib did not alter the expression level
of ABCB1 and ABCG2
ABC transporter-mediated MDR may be circumven­
ted by downregulating the expression of the transporters
or by inhibiting their transport function. Therefore, we
determined the effect of ceritinib on the mRNA and protein
expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 using RT-PCR and
Western blot analysis, respectively. Our results showed
that no significant difference in ABCB1 or ABCG2
expression at the mRNA or protein level was observed
in KBv200, MCF-7/adr cells or S1-M1-80 cells treated
with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μM ceritinib for 48 h compared
to untreated control cells (Figure 6A–6C). Therefore, it
is likely that ceritinib reversed MDR by inhibiting the
transport function of ABCB1 and ABCG2, but not by
downregulating the expression of the transporters.

Ceritinib stimulated the ATPase activity
of ABCB1 and ABCG2
The drug-efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCG2
is linked to ATP hydrolysis which is stimulated in the
presence of ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrates. To understand
whether ceritinib influenced the ATPase activity of
ABCB1 and ABCG2, we measured the vanadate-sensitive
ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in the presence
of a range of different concentrations of ceritinib. While
ceritinib activated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 in
a concentration-dependent manner, it stimulated the
ATPase activity of ABCG2 at low concentrations but the
stimulated ABCG2 ATPase activity dropped at higher
concentration of ceritinib (Figure 5B, 5C). These results
indicated that ceritinib may be a substrate of ABCB1 and
ABCG2.

Ceritinib did not change the cell surface
expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2
To further understand whether the localization of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 were influenced by ceritinib, we
analyzed the cell surface expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2
in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM ceritinib in ABCB1or ABCG2- overexpressing MDR cells and their parental
cells. We found that the expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2
was no obvious change in KBv200, MCF-7/adr and S1MI-80 in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM ceritinib, and
their parental cells no expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2,

Ceritinib bound to substrate binding site
of ABCB1 and ABCG2
The substrate binding site of ABCB1 or ABCG2
could be photo-labeled by [125I]-IAAP. It is known that

whether the enhancement effect of ceritinib was related to
the change in phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK1/2
in KBv200, MCF-7/adr, S1-MI-80 and their parental
cells, we examined the total and phosphorylation of AKT
and ERK1/2 after treating the cells with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5
μM ceritinib for 48 h. As shown in Figure 7, there was
no significant alteration in the total and phosphorylated
forms of AKT or ERK1/2. These results suggested that the

overexpression of ABC transporters is probably one of
the earliest event when a cancer cell acquire multidrug
resistance and it is also the most commonly reported. The
broad substrate specificity of MDR transporters implied
that the drug resistance can affect simultaneously a broad
spectrum of anticancer drugs with diverse structure
and functional features. The recent discovery of potent
and specific inhibition of various ABC transporters by
TKIs represents a new strategy to circumvent MDR. To
this end, TKIs have been reported to interact with the

progression or who cannot tolerate crizotinib [25].
Importantly, ceritinib was also shown to be effective in
patients not responding to crizotinib [11], Our results
showed for the first time that ceritinib potently reversed
both ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR. The MDR
reversal effect is specific because ceritinib did not affect
the cytotoxicity of the concomitantly administered
anticancer drugs in the parental sensitive cells (KB,
MCF-7 & S1) and the mock transfected (HEK293/
pcDNA3.1) cells. Moreover, ceritinib also did not affect
the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (a non-substrate of ABCB1
and ABCG2).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To elucidate the mechanism of MDR reversal,
we evaluated the inhibition of substrate drug efflux by
ceritinib in the ABCB1 and ABCG2-overepressing cancer
cells. Consistent with the drug sensitization observed in
the resistant cells, ceritinib was found to inhibit the efflux
function of both ABCB1 and ABCG2, thereby increasing
the accumulation of anticancer drugs in the cells.
ABC transporters exert their drug efflux function
by utilizing energy derived from the hydrolysis of
ATP to transport their substrates across the membrane
against a concentration gradient [26]. Therefore, the
rate of ATP hydrolysis (ATPase activity) is related to

the transport activity of ABC transporters. Some TKIs
such as lapatinib [27], sunitinib [28], erlotinib [20],
apatinib [29], crizotinib [30], even at low concentrations
could stimulate the ATPase activities of the transporters.
We found ceritinib stimulated both vanadate-sensitive
ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase. These results suggested that
ceritinib is likely a substrate of both ABCB1 and ABCG2.
This is further confirmed by the observation that ceritinib
competed with [125I]-IAAP for the photoaffinity labeling of
the two transporters.
The reversal of MDR may be achieved by
downregulation of the ABC transporter expression.
To this end, we found that ceritinib did not alter the
expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the MDR reversal
concentration. Ceritinib is an inhibitor of ALK tyrosine
kinase. Preclinical studies demonstrated that ceritinib can
led to suppression of ALK phosphorylation as well as the
downstream PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK and mTOR signaling
pathways[31, 32]. It was reported that the blockage of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and/or ERK pathways
could enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents
[32] We found that ceritinib did not alter the expression
and phosphorylation level of AKT and ERK1/2. These
demonstrated the reversal of MDR by ceritinib was not
associated with the inhibition AKT and ERK pathways.
Taken together, our results advocate the further
investigation of the combination of ceritinib with other
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinic for
the treatment of patients with ABCB1 or ABCG2mediated MDR.

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,USA).
Ceritinib was purchased from selleck chemicals (Houston,
TX, USA), with a molecular structure as shown in
Figure 1A. Monoclonal antibodies against ABCB1,
ABCG2, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1
and 2 (ERK1/2), p-ERK, AKT and p-AKT were from Santa

The KBv200 cell xenograft model was established
as described previously with minor modification [39],
Athymic nude mice (5–6 weeks old) were purchased from
the center of experimental animals (Southern Medical
University). Briefly, KBv200 cells grown in vitro were
harvested and implanted subcutaneously under the
shoulder in the nude mice. When the tumors reached a
mean diameter of 0.5 cm, the mice were randomized into
four groups and treated as follows: (1) saline (q3d × 4);
(2) paclitaxel (20 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 4); (3) Ceritinib
(25 mg/kg, p.o., q3d × 4); and (4) Ceritinib (25 mg/kg,
p.o., q3d × 4 given 1 h before injecting paclitaxel)+
paclitaxel (20 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 4). The body weights of
the animals and the two perpendicular diameters (A and B)

Cell cytotoxicity assay
The MTT assay was used to assess cytotoxicity
as described previously [37]. Briefly, cells growing in
logarithmic phase were seeded at a density of 2000 ~ 6000
cells per well in 96-well plates. When the cells became
adherent 24 h later, a range of different concentrations of
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs with or without a
fixed combination of ceritinib were added to the wells.
After 68 h, MTT (5 mg/ml, 20 μL) was added into each
well, and 4 h later, the medium was discarded and 150
μL DMSO was added into the wells to dissolve the
formazan product from the metabolism of MTT. Finally,
optical density was measured at 540 nm, with background
subtraction at 670 nm by a Model 550 Microplate Reader
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The half maximal (50%)
inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of a substance was
calculated by the Bliss method [38]. The fold reversal
of MDR was calculated as previously described [29].
All experiments were repeated at least three times.

The effect of ceritinib on the accumulation of
DOX and Rho 123 was measured by flow cytometry as
previously described [40]. Briefly, the cells were incubated
in six-well plates to allow attach to the wall overnight.
Then the cells were exposed to different concentrations of
ceritinib (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 μM). After 3 h, DOX (10 μM)
or Rho 123 (5 μM) was added to the medium for further
incubation for another 3 h or 0.5 h, then the cells were
collected, centrifuged and washed three times with icecold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, cells were
resuspended in 500 μl PBS buffer for flow-cytometric
analysis (Cytomics FC500; Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea,
CA, USA). Verapamil, a known ABCB1 inhibitor, was
used as a positive control for KBv200, KB, MCF-7/adr,
MCF-7 cells [41]. Fumitremorgin C (FTC), a specific
ABCG2 inhibitor, was used as a positive control of
ABCG2 in S1-MI-80 and S1 cells [42].

Rochester, NY) at −80°C for 4 h. The radioactivity
incorporated into the transporter protein was quantified
using the Storm 860 PhosphorImager system (Molecular
Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).

DOX efflux was performed following a modification
of methods described earlier [28]. KB and KBv200 cells
were treated with 10 μM DOX for 3 h at 37°C, then
the cells were washed three times and subsequently
maintained at 37°C with culture media without DOX in
the presence or absence of 0.5 μM ceritinib at 0, 15, 30, 60
and 120 min, cells were collected and washed three times
with ice-cold PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in icecold PBS buffer for flow cytometric analysis immediately
(Beckman Coulter).

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and Q-PCR
ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA expression level
was assayed as previously described [27]. Cells were
treated with different concentrations of ceritinib for
48 h, after which total cellular RNA was isolated
by Trizol Reagent RNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instruction (Molecular Research
Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA). The first strand cDNA
was synthesized by Oligo dT primers with reverse
transcriptase (Promega Corp.). PCR primers were

ABCG2, 5′-CTTTGGTATCGTGGAAGGA-3′ (forward)
and 5′-CACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCC-3′ (reverse) for
GAPDH, reactions were carried out at 94°C for 2 min
for initial denaturation, and then at 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for
30 s and 72°C for 1 min. After 35 cycles of amplification,
additional extensions were carried out at 72°C for 10 min.
At last products were resolved and examined by 1%
agarose gel electrophoresis.
Real-time PCR was performed with Real-time PCR
Master Mix containing SYBR GREEN I and hotstart Taq
DNA polymerase. SYBR Green Assay kit (Molecular
Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA) was used for real
time PCR reaction, following manufacturer’s protocol.
The reaction was under the following conditions: 50°C
for 2 min, 95°C for 5 min and 40 cycles at 95°C for 15
s, 60°C for 30 s. Data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt
method and normalized by GAPDH expression in each
sample.

ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase activity assay
A colorimetric ATPase assay was performed as
previously described with minor modification [43].
Briefly, crude membranes isolated from High Five
insect cells expressing either ABCB1 or ABCG2 (100
μg protein/mL) were incubated at 37°C with a range of
different concentrations of ceritinib in the presence or
absence of sodium orthovanadate (0.3 mM for ABCB1
and 1.2 mM for ABCG2) in ATPase assay buffer (50 mM
KCl, 5 mM sodium azide, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2,
1 mM DTT, pH 6.8) for 5 min. The crude membranes
were kind gift provided by Dr Suresh Ambudkar
(National Cancer Institute, NIH, USA). ATP hydrolysis
reaction was then started by the addition of 5 mM
Mg-ATP (concentration in a final volume of 60 μL)
and incubated for 20 min (for ABCB1) or 10 min (for
ABCG2). SDS solution (30 μL of 10% SDS) was added
to terminate the reaction. Absorbance was subsequently
measured at 750 nm after the addition of a detection
reagent (35 mM ammonium molybdate, 15 mM zinc
acetate, 10% ascorbic acid) and incubation at 37°C for
20 min. The amount of inorganic phosphate released was
quantified by reading from a standard curve. Specific
ceritinib-stimulated ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase
activity (i.e. vanadate-sensitive) was determined as the
difference between the amounts of inorganic phosphate
released from ATP in the absence and presence of sodium
orthovanadate.

Photo-affinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2
with [125I]-IAAP

The protein expression of ABCB1, ABCG2 or the
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 were evaluated
in the ABCB1 and ABCG2 over-expressing cells and
their parental cells after treatment with ceritinib (0.125,
0.25 and 0.5 μM) for 48 h. Western blot analysis was
conducted as previously described [27]. After blocking
with 5% nonfat milk for 2 hours at room temperature,
the membranes were immunoblotted by using antibodies
including ABCB1,ABCG2, ERK1/2, p-ERK, AKT and
p-AKT overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then
washed three times with TBST and incubated with HRPconjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution for

Crude membrane from High Five insect cells
expressing ABCB1 or ABCG2 (50 μg protein) was
