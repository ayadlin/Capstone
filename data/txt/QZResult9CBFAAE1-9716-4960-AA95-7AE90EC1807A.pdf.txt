Abstract
Drug resistance remains a major clinical challenge for cancer
treatment. Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell cancer
selectively localized in the bone marrow. The main cause of
resistance in myeloma is the minimal residual disease cells that
are resistant to the original therapy, including bortezomib
treatment and high-dose melphalan in stem cell transplant. In
this study, we demonstrate that altered tumor cell metabolism
is essential for the regulation of drug resistance in multiple
myeloma cells. We show the unprecedented role of the metabolic phenotype in inducing drug resistance through LDHA and
HIF1A in multiple myeloma, and that speciﬁc inhibition of

LDHA and HIF1A can restore sensitivity to therapeutic agents
such as bortezomib and can also inhibit tumor growth induced
by altered metabolism. Knockdown of LDHA can restore sensitivity of bortezomib resistance cell lines while gain-of-function studies using LDHA or HIF1A induced resistance in bortezomib-sensitive cell lines. Taken together, these data suggest
that HIF1A and LDHA are important targets for hypoxia-driven
drug resistance. Novel drugs that regulate metabolic pathways
in multiple myeloma, speciﬁcally targeting LDHA, can be
beneﬁcial to inhibit tumor growth and overcome drug resistance. Cancer Res; 75(10); 2071–82. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

increasing glycolysis and decreasing mitochondrial function (6).
The largest functional group of genes consistently regulated by
HIF1 is associated with glucose metabolism. HIF1 increases the
expression of the glucose transporters, enzymatic breakdown of
glucose into pyruvate and enzymes involved in the pyruvate
metabolism as well as lactate production (8, 9). Although HIF1
was initially identiﬁed because of its response to low O2 concentrations, it is now apparent that HIF1 can be regulated by other
factors such as oncogene activation (RAS, MYC, and PI3K) or loss
of tumor suppressors, including VHL (von Hippel–Lindau) or
PTEN, leading to increased glycolysis, angiogenesis, and drug
resistance (10–12).
Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell cancer selectively localized in the bone marrow. The introduction of novel
agents, including bortezomib in combination with autologous
stem cell transplantation, has led to a signiﬁcant advancement
in the treatment of patients, leading to complete response in
many patients. Unfortunately, most patients ultimately relapse
due to the presence of surviving tumor cells at the minimal
residual disease (MRD) state, suggesting the presence of drug
resistance within speciﬁc niches in the bone marrow. The bone
marrow has heterogeneous areas of hypoxia and these speciﬁc
niches are altered during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1).
We hypothesize that hypoxia in speciﬁc bone marrow niches
regulates the maintenance of MRD cells that are resistant to
treatment and have the capability to induce relapse. We sought
to investigate the mechanism underlying this drug resistance
through the cellular metabolic proﬁle of multiple myeloma
cells in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results reveal
unprecedented features of multiple myeloma cells metabolism
and further demonstrate that LDHA and HIF1A are valid targets
to prevent multiple myeloma drug resistance and progression
in vivo.

Cellular metabolic versatility is essential for the maintenance of
energy production throughout a range of oxygen concentrations
(1). Metabolic changes occurring in cancer cells are considered to
be fundamental for the transformation of normal cells into cancer
cells. A common property of invasive cancers is an altered glucose
metabolism or glycolysis (1). Glycolysis converts glucose into
pyruvate and in normal cells, this process is inhibited by the
presence of oxygen, which allows mitochondria to oxidize pyruvate to CO2 and H2O. This inhibition is termed as the "Pasteur
effect" (2). Conversion of glucose to lactic acid in the presence of
oxygen is known as aerobic glycolysis or the "Warburg effect" and
the increase of aerobic glycolysis is often observed in tumor cells
(3–5).
One of the most recognized reasons for altered tumor metabolism is hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (6, 7). Cells
respond to the hypoxic microenvironment with the activation of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) transcription factor. The net
result of hypoxic HIF1 activation is to shift energy production by

Materials and Methods
Cells
Multiple myeloma cell lines MM1S, H929, and RPMI8226
(were kindly provided by Prof. Jes
us F. San Miguel, Clinica
Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain). Cell lines were
cultured in RPMI1640 medium with L-glutamine and supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin at 100 U/mL, streptomycin
at 100 mg/mL) and 10% FBS. The luciferase (luc)-expressing
MM1S-GFP/luc cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction with the pGC-gfp/luc vector (kind gift of Dr. A. Kung,
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA).
Growth inhibition assay
The inhibitory effect of different drugs was assessed by
measuring MTT (Chemicon International) dye absorbance, as
previously described (13, 14).
Cell cycle and apoptosis assays
Cell-cycle analysis was proﬁled by ﬂow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining (5 mg/mL, Sigma Chemical) after 24
hours culture in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Apoptosis was
measured using Annexin V–FITC staining and ﬂow cytometric
analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Gene expression proﬁle
Gene expression proﬁle has been performed on MM1S using
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, (GEO accession
number: GSE52315). Comparison between normoxia (n ¼ 3) and
hypoxia (n ¼ 3) was performed by using dChip (2-fold change; P <
0.05). Differentially expressed genes were classiﬁed using dChip
software. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed
using the publicly available desktop application from the Broad
Institute (http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/software/software_index.html). The gene sets database used was that of functional sets,
s2.symbols.gmt. P values were calculated by permuting the genes
1,000 times. The classic enrichment statistic was selected. The gene
expression datasets from Schaefer CF and colleagues provided in
the Pathway Interaction Database (NCI and Nature Publishing
Group) were used for HIF1A and HIF2A analysis in GSEA (15). The
gene expression datasets REACTOME_ GLUCOSE_ METABOLISM
and KEGG_ PYRUVATE_ METABOLISM were used, respectively,
for glucose metabolism and TCA cycle analysis in GSEA. Gene
pattern (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/download) analysis was performed using the "Comparative
Marker Selection" tool to ﬁnd the genes that are most closely
correlated with the two phenotypes normoxia and hypoxia.
To determine the gene enrichments sets of hypoxia-related pathways, glucose metabolism, and TCA cycle in plasma cells isolated
from normal subjects or from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
patients, as well as from responder and relapsed patients to
bortezomib, we used published datasets from the Gene Expression
Omnibus by Chng and colleagues and Mulligan and colleagues
(series numbers GSE6477 and GSE9782, respectively; refs. 16, 17).
Metabolite proﬁling
Metabolites were extracted in ice-cold methanol and endogenous metabolite proﬁles were obtained using two liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods as
described (18). Data were acquired using a 5500 QTRAP triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB/Sciex) coupled to a Prominence UFLC system (Shimadzu) via selected reaction monitoring

of a total of 289 endogenous water soluble metabolites for steadystate analyses of samples.
Metaboanalyst software was used for analysis. Metabolite levels
were normalized to the total of all metabolites detected on a
triplicate set of cells treated identically to the experimental cells.
Hexokinase activity and lactate measurement
Hexokinase activity was measured with the Hexokinase Assay
Kit (Abcam) and cellular lactate levels were measured using the
Lactate Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
RNA puriﬁcation, reverse transcription, and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was prepared with QIAzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of
total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis (Invitrogen). Diluted cDNAs were analyzed by
real-time PCR using SYBR Green I Master Mix on Lightcycler 480
(Roche) on an ABI Prism 7900 Fast instrument. The level of gene
expression was normalized to 18S. The primer sequences are
provided in Table 1.
In vivo studies
Six-week-old female SCID-beige mice from Charles River Laboratories were i.v. implanted with 100 mL of 5  106 MM1S-GFP/
luc-scramble, MM1S-GFP/luc-shHIF1A, or MM1S-GFP/lucshLDHA. Mice were treated with bortezomib, 0.75 mg/kg in
PBS once weekly by intraperitoneal injection beginning 10 days
after tumor implantation until moribund. Mice with different
stages of tumor development based on tumor size detected by
bioluminescence (BLI) were treated with the hypoxia marker
pimonidazole hydrochloride (PIMO; 100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection; Hypoxyprobe Store). After 4 hours, bone marrow
was isolated from one femur by ﬂushing with cold PBS and
prepared for RNA isolation as described, the other femur was
used for IHC.
In vivo tumor growth has been assessed by using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Mice were injected with 75 mg/kg of luciferin (Xenogen), and tumor growth was detected by bioluminescence 3 minutes after the injection, using Xenogen In Vivo
Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Mice were monitored
and sacriﬁced when they developed side effects of tumor burden
in accordance with approved protocol of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (DFCI, Boston, MA) Animal Care and Use Committee.
Immunohistochemistry
In the in vivo model, femurs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and embedded in parafﬁn. Sections were stained with hematoxylin

and eosin (H&E) in accordance with standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against Mab1
(Hypoxyprobe Store), HK2 (Cell Signaling Technology) and LDHA
(Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. All multiple myeloma biopsies were evaluated at DFCI
and the histologic diagnosis was based on H&E. Histologic IHC
images were obtained with the Olympus AH2 microscope camera
from Center Valley. Image acquisition and processing software were
performed using an Olympus DP12 camera and software.
Knockdown constructs
Stable knockdowns of HIF1A, HIF2A, HK2, and LDHA were
generated by lentiviral transduction of MM1S and MM1S-GFP/luc
cells with ﬁve independent shRNA hairpin sequences targeting
human HIF1A, HIF2A, HK2, and LDHA, respectively. A scrambled
shRNA sequence was used as control (TRCN0000072212).
Lentiviral shRNAs were obtained from The RNAi Consortium
(TCR) collection of the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA). The TCR
numbers for the shRNA used are found in Table 2.
Statistical analysis
P values described in the in vitro assays are based on t tests
(two-tailed; a 0.05). P values are provided for each ﬁgure.

Results
Hypoxia promotes drug resistance in multiple myeloma
We ﬁrst examined hypoxia-regulated pathways in primary multiple myeloma patients to test the enrichment of HIF1A and HIF2A
(15) pathways in plasma cells isolated from bone marrow of
normal donors and multiple myeloma patients; we analyzed the
published gene expression datasets (series numbers, GSE6477 and
GSE9782, respectively; refs. 16, 17). Newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma patients showed an enrichment of HIF1A and HIF2A
pathways compared with normal donors (Supplementary Fig.
S1A), we also found an enrichment of both pathways in patients
with relapsed and bortezomib-refractory myeloma compared with
patients responding to bortezomib (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We next investigated whether hypoxia plays a role in drug
resistance in multiple myeloma. Given the importance of hypoxia

in facilitating tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy
in solid tumors, we evaluated the effect of several conventional
agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma such as dexamethasone, melphalan, and bortezomib, either under normoxia
(20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) in multiple myeloma cells. Our
ﬁndings indicate that hypoxia inhibited the effect of bortezomib
and melphalan in MM1S (Supplementary Fig. S1C), RPMI8226
(Supplementary Fig. S1D), and H929 (Supplementary Fig. S1E)
cells. As hypoxia has been shown to cause cell-cycle arrest and this
could potentially impact therapeutic responses, we analyzed the
effect of hypoxia on cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis by ﬂow
cytometry. After 24 hours, hypoxia induced G1 arrest (Supplementary Fig. S1F) but not apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1G) in
multiple myeloma cells. However, induction of G1 arrest through
serum starvation (Supplementary Fig. S1H) did not impact the
response to bortezomib in MM1S, RPMI8226, and H929 (Supplementary Fig. S1I). Carﬁlzomib showed similar activity to
bortezomib on MM1S, RPMI8226, and H929 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1J). Therefore, the drug resistance effect observed with
hypoxia was not due to the G1 arrest observed in hypoxic conditions. To further conﬁrm the effect of hypoxia, we pretreated the
cells for 12 hours under normoxic or hypoxic conditions and then
added the therapeutic agent for an additional 24 hours under both
normoxia and hypoxia. We found multiple myeloma cells
responded to bortezomib treatment under normoxic conditions
but not under hypoxia even with previous culture in normal
oxygen levels (Supplementary Fig. S1K).
Metabolic reprogramming delineates a role for drug resistance
in myeloma cells
Because one of largest functional groups regulated by HIF1 is
associated with glucose metabolism, we hypothesized that
changes in cell metabolism could serve as the main factor of drug
resistance in multiple myeloma cells. To examine mechanisms
underlying metabolism-associated drug resistance, we performed
targeted metabolomic proﬁling in MM1S cells before and after
bortezomib treatment under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The metabolic proﬁle of hypoxic cells demonstrated a clear
shift when compared with normoxic cells; however, cells treated
with bortezomib were similar to their nontreated counterparts in
both conditions (Fig. 1A). In hypoxic cells, intermediates of TCA
cycle and mitochondrial electron transport chain were reduced,
whereas intermediates of glycolysis were elevated (Fig. 1B).
To determine speciﬁc metabolic changes are due to hypoxia and
not to the G1 cell-cycle arrest observed in hypoxic cells, we starved
MM1S cells for 12 hours and the metabolic proﬁle of MM1S cells
arrested at G1 phase showed a decrease on glucose-6-phosphate,
fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, pyruvate, and
lactate metabolites (Fig. 1C). In contrast to G1-arrested cells,
hypoxic cells showed an increase in glycolysis metabolites, including pyruvate and lactate (Fig. 1C and D). To further examine
metabolic alterations in hypoxic conditions, we performed gene
expression proﬁle (GEP) on MM1S under normoxic or hypoxic
conditions and performed GSEA using the ranked gene list from
Dchip (changes in gene expression greater than 2-fold with P value
lower than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant). To identify the most
signiﬁcant pathways altered by hypoxia, we compared normoxic
samples (n ¼ 3) versus hypoxic samples (n ¼ 3) and found that after
24 hours of hypoxia, 3,609 genes were deregulated (1,649 genes
were upregulated in hypoxia and 1,960 genes were upregulated in
normoxia; Fig. 2A). The main pathways altered by hypoxic culture

Metabolomic Signature and Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma

were those involved in glucose metabolism (including glycolytic
enzymes; Fig. 2B and C) and TCA cycle (Fig. 2C). We also validated
our data on additional cell lines, and showed that similar changes
on key metabolic genes (HK2, PFKFB3, PFKFB4, and LDHA) were
observed among all the cell lines tested MM1S, H929, and
RPMI8226 (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C).
Glucose metabolism gene set was also enriched in the datasets
comparing plasma cells from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
patients with normal donors and in plasma cells from relapsed
myeloma patients versus newly diagnosed (ND) multiple myeloma (Fig. 2D).
Importantly, hypoxia regulates expression of HIF1A target
genes that are critical for increased glucose uptake and catabolism
such as hexokinase II (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA;
refs. 19–21). Both genes were signiﬁcantly upregulated in our
expression datasets (FC ¼ 2.1 and FC ¼ 5.2, respectively). To test
whether bortezomib affects the enzymatic activities of HK2 and
LDHA, we measured the hexokinase and lactate activities in cells
treated with bortezomib under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
Bortezomib was able to decrease the hexokinase activity even
under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2E) but not the lactate activity that
was signiﬁcantly increased under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2F). We
found that bortezomib inhibited HK2 activity of multiple myeloma cells under hypoxic conditions but not lactate activity,
suggesting that LDHA may play a role in modulating drug
resistance of multiple myeloma cells in hypoxia.
HIF1A knockdown decreases lactate levels and partially restores
the effect of bortezomib under hypoxic conditions
HIF1A is the main pathway to induce glycolysis and lactate
production during hypoxia (20, 22, 23). Under low oxygen
conditions, HIF1A is stabilized and promotes transcription of
several genes critical for the cellular response to hypoxia (10). We
hypothesized that cells lacking HIF1A will fail to upregulate
glycolytic enzymes and lactate production in response to hypoxia
and will render them more sensitive to chemotherapy. To test this
hypothesis, we performed HIF1A and HIF2A loss-of-function
studies in multiple myeloma cells. HIF1A and HIF2A knockdown
efﬁciencies were evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blot
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). The metabolic proﬁle
of MM1S-HIF1A knockdown cells demonstrated a clear shift away
from glycolytic metabolism when compared with MM1S-scramble under normoxic conditions (Fig. 3A), and a similar shift
occurred under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3A). In MM1S- HIF2A
knockdown, intermediates of glycolysis were slightly reduced,
but pyruvate and lactate levels increased after hypoxia exposure
(Fig. 3A). The levels of TCA cycle intermediates decreased in

HIF1A and HIF2A knockdowns compared with MM1S-scramble
after either normoxia or hypoxia exposures (Fig. 3B).
To conﬁrm that the HIF1A and HIF2A knockdown metabolites
patterns reﬂected a shift in glycolysis and mainly in lactate
production, we measure hexokinase activity and lactate production in both cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As
expected, HIF1A knockdown cells showed a reduction in hexokinase activity under hypoxic conditions similar to normoxic
levels (Fig. 3C) and a signiﬁcant decrease in lactate production
in both normoxic and hypoxic levels compared with the scramble
(Fig. 3D). Hexokinase and lactate activities did not change in
HIF2A knockdown cells (Fig. 3C and D).
Consistent with the metabolite proﬁle pattern and the reduction of hexokinase and lactate levels, the HIF1A knockdown
partially overcomes drug resistance to bortezomib (Fig. 3E) and
melphalan (Supplementary Fig. S3D) after hypoxia exposure.
However, HIF2A knockdown did not produce similar results,
indicating that HIF2A is not essential for the induced drug
resistance (Fig. 3F).
To determine the in vivo effect of HIF1A loss, we knock down
HIF1A expression in MM1S-GFP/luc. HIF1A knockdown efﬁciency was evaluated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3E). MM1SGFP/luc-scramble (n ¼ 14) and MM1S-GFP/luc-shHIF1A (HIF1A
knockdown, clone 2; n ¼ 14) were injected i.v. into NOD-SCID
mice. After 10 days we started the treatment of each group (n ¼ 7
per group), 28 mice were treated with vehicle (n ¼ 14) or
bortezomib (0.75 mg/kg, weekly, intraperitoneally; n ¼ 14).
Tumor growth was measured using luciferin and BLI.
After 35 days, the scramble group demonstrated signiﬁcant
tumor progression, whereas minimal tumor growth was detected
in mice injected with HIF1A knockdown (Fig. 3G). Mice groups
injected with scramble cells and treated with bortezomib showed a
delay in tumor growth, but after 35 days, the tumor growth
increased reaching similar BLI signal to the control group (Fig.
3G). Bortezomib showed a signiﬁcant effect in the HIF1A knockdown group (Fig. 3G), increasing the survival signiﬁcantly compared with the nontreated group and compared with the control
group treated with bortezomib (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, mice
femurs were collected at day 10 and at day 35, and CD138
expression was analyzed by IHC. In concordance with our BLI
data, we observed an increase of CD138þ population with a strong
staining in the scramble biopsies, whereas the HIF1A knockdown
group remained very low even at day 35 (Fig. 3I). The hypoxic state
of multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow was also examined
by intraperitoneal injection of pimonidazole (PIMO) before bone
marrow isolation and IHC was performed to detect HK2 and
LDHA protein levels in tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that

Metabolomic Signature and Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma

the increase of the hypoxic microenvironment induces the overexpression of HK2 and LDHA in plasma cells (Fig. 3J).
Loss of LDHA sensitizes multiple myeloma cells to drug effect
To better deﬁne the functional role of glycolysis pathways in
drug resistance on multiple myeloma cells, we explored the
expression of the glycolytic enzymes deregulated in our genes'
expression proﬁle (GEP; Fig. 4A) and performed HK2 and LDHA
loss-of-function studies on MM1S cells (Fig. 4B). HK2 and LDHA
knockdown efﬁciency was evaluated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and S4B).
To conﬁrm that HK2 and LDHA expression are increased in
multiple myeloma, we analyzed HK2 and LDHA protein levels by
IHC in plasma cells of newly diagnosed and refractory myeloma
patients. Out of 20 patient samples, all samples showed high
levels of HK2 and LDHA staining in tumor CD138þ plasma cells
(Fig. 4C). Similarly, GEP of an independent set of CD138þ cells
(16, 17) revealed that the expression of HK2 and LDHA increased
with disease progression (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
We evaluated the effect of LDHA and HK2 knockdown on
hexokinase activity and intracellular levels of lactate and found
that knockdown of HK2 leads to inhibition of both hexokinase
activity and lactate (Fig. 4D); however, LDHA knockdown showed
a reduction in lactate but did not affect the cellular hexokinase
activity compared with scramble control cells (Fig. 4E).
We next examined the effect of bortezomib in HK2 and LDHA
knockdowns. MM1S-shHK2 (HK2 knockdown) cells were sensitive
to the effect of bortezomib after exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 4F),
whereas the effect of bortezomib was markedly higher in MM1SshLDHA (LDHA knockdown) under both normoxic and hypoxic
conditions (Fig. 4G). We also examined the effect in response to
melphalan treatment, and LDHA KD restored the effect of melphalan under hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Therefore, this effect shows that metabolism-induced drug resistance
represents a common mechanism of resistance to drug therapy and
not just speciﬁc to bortezomib or proteasome inhibition.
LDHA expression as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1
(PDK1) were found to be upregulated in the GEP data analysis.
Both of these enzymes can limit the use of pyruvate as a carbon
source for the TCA cycle (24, 25). Indeed, our metabolomics data
show an overall decrease in TCA pool sizes under hypoxic conditions. To determine whether pyruvate utilization plays a role in
drug resistance, we performed gain-of-function experiments with
PDK1 (Supplementary Fig. S4E) and examined the effect of
bortezomib in PDK1-expressing cells under normoxic conditions.
We observed that MM1S-PDK1–expressing cells were resistant to
the effect of bortezomib (Supplementary Fig. S4F), this effect was

similar to that observed in MM1S wild-type under hypoxic conditions where PDK1 was upregulated by microarray analysis.
Similar to our previous in vivo studies, we knocked down LDHA
expression in MM1S-GFP/luc. LDHA knockdown efﬁciency was
evaluated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4G). MM1S-GFP/
luc-shLDHA (LDHA knockdown, clone 4; n ¼ 14) were injected
i.v. into NOD-SCID mice and treatment was initiated after 10
days. Mice were treated with vehicle (n ¼ 7) or bortezomib (0.75
mg/kg, weekly, intraperitoneally; n ¼ 7).
After 35 days, the tumor progression was lower in the LDHA
knockdown mice compared with their controls and the LDHA
knockdown group treated with bortezomib showed a signiﬁcant
delay in tumor growth (Fig. 4H). Survival curves showed a
signiﬁcant difference between the scramble and LDHA knockdown groups and bortezomib highly increased the survival percentage of the LDHA knockdown mice compared with the nontreated group and with the scramble-treated group (Fig. 4I). The
observed changes may be due to an impact of HIF1A and LDHA
silencing on both bone marrow homing/engraftment of multiple
myeloma cells, together with a reduced multiple myeloma cell
growth. These data are indeed supported by the IHC studies where
a reduced human-CD138 cell inﬁltration was documented in
those mice that were injected with HIF1A- and LDHA-silenced
MM1S cells compared with the related scramble control.
Mice femurs were collected at day 10 and IHC was performed to
detect PIMO, HK2, and LDHA levels. In concordance with our in
vitro data, even under hypoxic conditions as demonstrated by
PIMO staining, LDHA knockdown group showed a lower HK2
expression in plasma cells (Fig. 4J).
HIF1A and LDHA expression are associated with drug resistance
To further conﬁrm the dependence between HIF1A, LDHA, and
drug resistance, we examined the relative levels of HIF1A and
LDHA in a panel of six multiple myeloma representative cell lines:
MM1S and MM1R (sensitive and resistant to dexamethasone),
U266 and U266LR7 (sensitive and resistant to melphalan), and
ANBL6 and ANBL6-bortezomib-resistant (BR; sensitive and resistant to bortezomib, respectively).
We found that HIF1A (Fig. 5A) and particularly LDHA (Fig. 5B)
levels are upregulated in all the cell lines resistant to different
drugs as compared with their drug-sensitive counterparts.
To better characterize the role of LDHA in drug resistant to
bortezomib, we knocked down LDHA expression in the bortezomib-resistant cell line ANBL6-BR (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and
overexpressed HIF1A and LDHA in MM1S cells (sensitive to
bortezomib; Supplementary Fig. S5B–S5D). In ANBL6-BR, LDHA
knockdown restored the sensitivity to bortezomib (Fig. 5C) and in

Discussion
Targeting cancer energy metabolism has been partly elusive
because of the poor understanding of metabolic phenotypes of
different cancers. One of the reasons for altered tumor metabolism is the physiologic stress that exists within the tumor. The
tumor microenvironment suffers from hypoxia and the net result
of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors activation is to shift
energy production by increasing glycolysis and decreasing mitochondrial function (6, 7).
It is well established that hypoxia and consequently HIF1A
activation is associated with metastasis in solid tumors and with

2080 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

poor patients outcome (26–28), but the metabolic-induced phenotype driven to drug resistance has been poorly explored mainly
because the lack of understanding of cellular responses to inhibition of speciﬁc enzymes involved in energy metabolism. In this
study, we demonstrate that altered metabolism has important
implications for tumor cell growth and drug resistance.
We ﬁnd that increased HIF1A-metabolic related targets such as
HK2 and LDHA are present in plasma cells from newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma patients and even more upregulated in
relapsed multiple myeloma patients, highlighting the importance
of elevated glucose metabolism in relapsed patients compared
with newly diagnosed myeloma cells. This fact is further validated
by the ﬁnding of a similar response and gene expression pattern in
multiple myeloma cell lines under hypoxic conditions that persist
even after bortezomib treatment and by the fact that both
HIF1A and LDHA are overexpressed in multiple myeloma cell
lines resistant to different treatments such as dexamethasone,
melphalan, and bortezomib. On the basis of this, we hypothesized that metabolic alterations play a crucial role in drug

Metabolomic Signature and Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma

resistance in multiple myeloma. This is most critical in the MRD
state when cells can survive in a hypoxic bone marrow niche after
treatment with bortezomib and high-dose melphalan in stem cell
transplantation, leading to ultimate recurrence of the disease.
In this study, we demonstrate that the increase of glycolytic
metabolism results in increased lactate levels in multiple myeloma
cells. Importantly, we show that increased glycolysis is not a consequence of the G1 arrest that cells undergo after hypoxia conditions.
Rather, hypoxia actively regulates cellular glucose metabolism by
activation of glycolytic enzymes transcription as we demonstrate by
GEP analysis and at the functional level by enzymatic assays. Thus,
taken together, our study shows that increased glycolysis leads to
chemotherapy resistance in multiple myeloma cells.
The role of dysregulated metabolism in therapeutic resistance
has not been examined previously (12, 29–34). The ability to
reduce chemoresistance through the inhibition of metabolic
pathways would be an important research area to improve patient
response to therapy. As a central energetic resource for the cell,
glucose metabolism is quite complex. Many enzymes contribute
to the glycolytic breakdown of glucose. In the glycolytic pathway,
the ﬁrst rate-limiting step is the transport of glucose across the
plasma membrane through glucose transporters (GLUT family).
GLUT family of proteins are often found upregulated in malignant cells (35). GLUT1 inhibitors, such as WZB117 and phloretin,
decrease glucose uptake and display synergistic anticancer effects
in lung, colon, and breast cancer as well as in leukemia in vitro (36,
37). Under hypoxia, the GLUT1 inhibitor, phloretin, signiﬁcantly
enhances daunorubicin effect and overcomes hypoxia-conferred
drug resistance (38). Another key rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis is HK, which has important roles in both glycolysis and
apoptosis, and inhibitors of HK, such as 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG),
3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), and lonidamine (LND) are in preclinical and early-phase clinical trials (31). Although there are
several reports showing that HK inhibitors enhance the drug
response in vitro under normoxic conditions (39–41), there are
no ongoing trials with HK inhibitors as a single agent due to the
lack of response in vivo (42). Consistent with these data, we did
not observe any effect in multiple myeloma cells treated with 2DG, 3-BrPA, or LND under hypoxic conditions or in our in vivo
model (data not shown). These ﬁndings together with the fact that
bortezomib was able to decrease HK2 activity under hypoxic
conditions and that our HK2 knockdown revealed a decrease in
LDHA activity led us to hypothesize that the main enzyme to
target in our hypoxia–drug-resistant model was LDHA. This
hypothesis is further supported by the fact that both HIF1A and
LDHA overexpression lead to drug resistance in MM1S, whereas
LDHA knockdown sensitizes ANBL6 bortezomib-resistant cells to
the effect of bortezomib. LDHA catalyzes the ﬁnal step in the
glycolytic pathway and has a critical role in tumor maintenance.
LDHA contributes to paclitaxel/trastuzumab resistance in breast
cancer (33, 34) and knockdown of LDHA increased mitochondrial respiration, decreased cellular ability to proliferate under
hypoxic conditions, and suppressed tumorigenicity in tumor cells
(43). In line with these data, our LDHA knockdown improves the
effect of bortezomib in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
and showed a signiﬁcant effect in our in vivo model.
Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that stable inhibition of
HIF1A in multiple myeloma cells decreased proliferation and
sensitized cells to the therapeutic effect of bortezomib. Stable
depletion of HIF1A inhibited glycolysis and decreased lactate
levels and this reduction of lactate remained at low levels even

www.aacrjournals.org

after the exposure to hypoxia. Reduction of HK2 and LDHA
expression also increased the effect the bortezomib under hypoxic
conditions; however, due to the LDHA reduction observed in our
stable HK2 knockdown and due to the fact that hexokinase
activity was also decreased in cells treated with bortezomib under
hypoxic conditions, we proposed that LDHA could be one of the
main targets to overcome drug resistance induced through hypoxia. Depletion of HIF1A and LDHA in multiple myeloma cells
also restored drug sensitivity to therapeutic agents such as bortezomib in vivo. Multiple myeloma tumors with HIF1A knockdown
clearly demonstrated a proliferative disadvantage compared with
the scramble control tumors and a signiﬁcant increase of survival
in the bortezomib-treated group. LDHA knockdown signiﬁcantly
improved the response to bortezomib treatment; however, the
overall survival in the nontreated group was similar to the scramble nontreated group. A possible explanation of the decreased
proliferation in multiple myeloma tumor with HIF1A knockdown may relate to the downregulation of the entire HIF1A
pathway that involves not only the effect on therapeutic response
but also a decrease of proliferation and angiogenesis (28, 44, 45).
In summary, our studies reveal that regulation of tumor cell
metabolism in multiple myeloma cells is essential to target drug
resistance in multiple myeloma. We show that the metabolic
phenotype in MRD cells induced by hypoxia leads to drug
resistance through HIF1A and that speciﬁc regulation of HIF1A
or LDHA can restore sensitivity to therapeutic agents such as
bortezomib and melphalan and can also inhibit tumor growth
induced by altered metabolism.
