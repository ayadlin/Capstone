ABSTRACT
Elevated expression of heat shock protein 5 (HSPA5) promotes drug resistance
and metastasis and is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Adenovirus
type 5 E1A gene therapy has demonstrated antitumor efficacy but the mechanisms
of metastasis-inhibition are unclear. Here, we report that E1A interacts with p300
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and blocks p300-mediated HSPA5 acetylation at
K353, which in turn promotes HSPA5 ubiquitination by GP78 (E3 ubiquitin ligase)
and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Our findings point out the YingYang regulation of two different post-translational modifications (ubiquitination and
acetylation) of HSPA5 in tumor metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

tumors and correlates with aggressive cancer types [3]. As
protein synthesis increases in fast-growing solid tumors,
cancer cells also require increased endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) capacity and function [4]. Heat shock protein 5
(HSPA5), also known as GRP78/BiP, is a major ER
chaperone that responds to UPR and is involved in many
cellular processes that promote proper protein folding
and prevent aggregation of newly synthesized proteins
[5]. HSPA5 overexpression has been reported in many
tumor types, including lung [6], breast [7, 8], prostate [9],
colon [10], stomach [11] and liver [12]. HSPA5 exhibits
oncogenic activities by promoting tumor proliferation,
survival, metastasis, and drug resistance and is associated
with malignancy and poor prognosis [13, 14]. Mice with
HSPA5 haploinsufficiency have decreased mammary
tumor growth, development, and metastasis as well as

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in women worldwide [1]. Current therapeutic options
for treating breast cancer have focused on various
combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy
and radiation treatment [2]. Despite improvements,
metastatic breast cancer responds poorly to conventional
therapy. Therefore, further investigation of the molecular
mechanisms and identification of specific targets in
the metastatic process are critical for developing more
effective breast cancer therapies.
Recent studies have indicated that the activation of
the unfolded protein response (UPR) is essential in solid

increased survival [13, 15]. HSPA5 knockdown also
inhibits tumor cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo [11, 14].
Adenovirus type 5 E1A possesses anti-cancer
activity and has been tested in multiple clinical trials,
including trials for breast, ovarian and head and neck
cancers [16-19]. E1A exerts its anti-cancer activity through
a diverse range of mechanisms, such as increasing drug
sensitivity and decreasing metastasis through the downregulation of HER2/neu [20, 21], eliciting the production
of apoptotic molecules through p38 activation [22],
sensitizing cells to radiation-induced apoptosis through
IKK activity suppression and IÎºB degradation [23],
decreasing miR-520h levels and the EMT marker TWIST
to inhibit metastasis [24], promoting the transformation of
malignant cancer cells into a benign epithelial phenotype
and inducing anoikis-sensitization through interactions
with its co-repressor CtBP to activate E-cadherin and
repress ZEB expression [25], and increasing chemosensitization by stabilizing FOXO3a through ubiquitinproteolysis pathway inhibition [26].
Based on the function of HSPA5 in cancer
progression, HSPA5 may represent a therapeutic cancer
therapy target. We sought to examine any potential
connections between HSPA5 and E1A-mediated anticancer activities. In this study, we demonstrate that the
E1A/p300 interaction inhibits HSPA5 acetylation at K353
and promotes GP78 the E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination
of HSPA5 and its subsequent degradation, which leads to
decreased breast cancer cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

mediated suppression of cell mobility (Fig. 1B). Next,
we used the established stable transfectants to further
investigate the effects of HSPA5 on E1A-mediated antitumor activity in a xenograft tumor model. This model
used mice that had been administered HSPA5-transfected
E1A stable clones by tail-vein injection and utilized a
bioluminescence system to detect metastasis development
in mice. Compared with 231/vector control-bearing mice,
lung colony formation was markedly reduced in 231/
E1A-bearing mice but not in 231/E1A/HSPA5-bearing
mice (Fig. 1C and 1D). These observations suggest that
HSPA5 is critical for migration/invasion, tumorigenesis,
and lung colonization of breast cancer cells and that E1Asuppressed HSPA5 is required for metastasis inhibition. In
these groups, 231/E1A-bearing mice exhibited increased
overall survival compared with 231/V-bearing mice;
however, the increase in overall survival was significantly
diminished in 231/E1A/HSPA5-bearing mice compared
with 231/E1A-bearing mice (Fig. 1E). These data suggest
that HSPA5 is critical for the E1A-mediated suppression
of breast cancer cell mobility.

E1A induces the ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation of HSPA5
Because E1A suppressed cell migration and
invasion through regulation of HSPA5 expression (Fig.
1A), we further examined whether E1A regulated HSPA5
stability. Cells (231/V and 231/E1A) were treated with
the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX),
and HSPA5 expression was measured by Western blot
analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, E1A expression markedly
reduced the half-life of HSPA5 (< 4 h). We then analyzed
endogenous HSPA5 protein expression in the presence
of the 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 to determine
how HSPA5 was degraded in response to E1A. We
found that the E1A-mediated downregulation of HSPA5
was restored by MG132 treatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting
that E1A mediates HSPA5 degradation via the ubiquitin
proteasome system. Additionally, immunoprecipitation
(IP) using an anti-HSPA5 antibody followed by an antiubiquitin antibody revealed that E1A expression increased
HSPA5 ubiquitination in breast cancer cells (Fig. 2C).
Next, we sought to determine which E3 ubiquitin ligase
was involved in the HSPA5 degradation process. Because
of the oncogenic properties and ER localization of HSPA5,
we screened a series of ER-associated degradation
(ERAD)-related E3 ubiquitin ligases, including GP78,
CHIP, CUL5, and PARKIN [27-30]. A specific shRNA
knockdown of GP78 but not CHIP, CUL5, or PARKIN
restored HSPA5 expression in 231/E1A cells (Fig. 2D). To
gain further mechanistic insight into how GP78 regulates
HSPA5 ubiquitination, we analyzed their interaction by
co-immunoprecipitation. We found that in the presence of
MG132, E1A enhanced the physical interaction between

RESULTS
HSPA5 is critical for E1A-mediated suppression
of cell mobility
Based on the function of HSPA5 as a molecular
target in cancer metastasis and progression, we sought to
investigate whether HSPA5 was a target of E1A in breast
cancer cells. We transfected E1A or control expression
vectors into a panel of breast cancer cell lines to investigate
the effects of E1A on HSPA5 expression and found that
E1A suppressed HSPA5 expression and cell migration/
invasion in three breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
HS578T and HBL100 cells) (Fig. 1A). In addition, we used
an HSPA5-overexpressing or control vector ectopically
expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing
E1A (231/E1A) to investigate the effects of HSPA5 on
the E1A-mediated suppression of cancer cell migration/
invasion (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the results in the 231/
E1A cell system, HSPA5 overexpression in two other
E1A-expressing cell lines (HS578T/E1A and HBL100/
E1A) restored cell migration and invasion. Results from
transwell and time-lapse cell tracker migration assays also
indicated that HSPA5 overexpression attenuated the E1Awww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GP78 is a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in E1Amediated HSPA5 regulation through its binding to HSPA5.

decreased in 231/E1A cells with a GP78 knockdown
compared with control shRNA (Fig. 3A, lines 3 and 4).
Because HSPA5 expression is critical for cancer cell
mobility, we also examined whether GP78 affected cell
migration and invasion. GP78 knockdown restored HSPA5
expression and also increased 231/E1A cell migration and
invasion (Fig. 3B, lines 4 and 3). However, the enhanced
cell migration and invasion was reduced by knocking
down HSPA5 in GP78-silenced 231/E1A cells (Fig. 3B,
lines 6 and 5), which suggests that GP78 is required for the
E1A-mediated suppression of cell migration and invasion
through HSPA5 proteolysis.
To further determine the effects of GP78 on E1Amediated anti-metastasis activity in a xenograft tumor

model, mice received stably transfected cells (231/V,
231/V/shGP78, 231/E1A, and 231/E1A/shGP78) by tailvein injection. Seven out of ten mice injected with 231/
E1A cells exhibited metastasis, but a GP78 knockdown in
231/E1A cells enhanced metastasis in all 10 mice. Mice
bearing 231/E1A-shGP78 xenografts had a significantly
increased number of metastatic nodules in the lungs
compared with the control (Fig. 3C). The survival rate
of mice bearing 231/E1A-shGP78 xenografts was also
significantly diminished compared with the control
(p = 0.04; Fig. 3D). These results suggest that GP78
E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is required for HSPA5
ubiquitination and involved in the regulation of E1Amediated metastasis inhibition.

acetylation is associated with the binding of HSPA5 and
ER stress mediators that prolongs UPR [31]. However,
whether acetylated HSPA5 exhibits changes in protein
stability is unclear. To address this question, 231/V and

expression was examined by Western blot analysis. In
231/E1A cells, treatment with LBH589 increased HSPA5
expression but not GP78 expression (Fig. 4A). We
further examined whether HSPA5 acetylation affected
its ubiquitination. Thus, 231/V and 231/E1A cells were
exposed to LBH589, and HSPA5 ubiquitination was
analyzed by IP and Western blot analysis. As shown
in Fig. 4B, 231/E1A cells exhibited increased HSPA5
ubiquitination and reduced HSPA5 acetylation compared
with 231/V cells. More importantly, LBH589 treatment
increased HSPA5 acetylation and decreased the binding
of the E3 ubiquitin ligase GP78 to HSPA5 and subsequent
HSPA5 ubiquitination (Fig. 4B).
Eleven putative acetylated lysine residues in HSPA5
have previously been identified by mass spectrometrybased proteomic analyses [31]. However, whether the
acetylated lysine residues in HSPA5 interfered with
HSPA5 ubiquitination remained uncertain. To further
confirm whether the acetylated lysine residues of HSPA5
reduce ubiquitylated HSPA5, various HSPA5 constructs
were transfected into HeLa cells, and their ubiquitination
levels were monitored by IP and Western blot analysis.
HSPA5 ubiquitination in wild-type HSPA5-transfected
cells increased compared with untransfected cells (Fig.
4C, lines 2 and 1). The ubiquitination levels of the
K352R mutant, which cannot be acetylated, were similar
to the wild-type HSPA5 levels (Fig. 4C, lines 2 and 3).
In contrast, ubiquitination of the K353R mutant was
increased compared with wild-type HSPA5 levels, and its

association with GP78 was also enhanced (Fig. 4C, line 4).
Moreover, transfection of the K352R/353R double mutant
(HSPA5/K2R) also increased ubiquitination of HSPA5 and
its interaction with GP78 (Fig. 4C, line 5). These results
imply that K353 is the major acetylation site affecting
HSPA5 ubiquitination.
Direct competition between lysine acetylation
and ubiquitination has been proposed as a major
regulatory mechanism to prevent protein ubiquitination
and degradation [32] and has been suggested to serve
a protective role for lysine acetylation by preventing
further modification of adjacent lysine residues. p300 is
known to acetylate Runx3 and prevent its degradation by
Smurf E3s [33], and E1A is involved in p300-mediated
regulation of histone activity in cell transformation [34].
Thus, we hypothesized that p300 also plays a role in E1Amediated HSPA5 inhibition. As shown in Fig. 4D, p300
associated with HSPA5 and enriched acetylated HSPA5
in 231/V cells. However, E1A prevented p300 binding to
HSPA5, leading to a reduction in acetylated HSPA5 (Fig.
4D). Next, we examined whether the association of E1A
and p300 was required for HSPA5 acetylation regulation.
HeLa cells were transfected with HSPA5 and HA-tagged
p300 in E1A- or E1A mutant-expressing cells, followed by
IP and Western blot analysis. p300 associated with HSPA5
in E1A mutant-expressing cells but not in wild-type
E1A-expressing cells (Fig. 4E). These findings suggest
that p300 binds to and acetylates HSPA5 and that E1A
expression abolishes the p300 binding to HSPA5 required

of HSPA5.

human tumors. Our study revealed that GP78 E3 ubiquitin
ligase decreased HSPA5 stability but did not affect its
acetylation. When E1A was expressed in cancer cells, it
associated with p300 to reduce acetylated HSPA5 levels
and enhanced its binding to GP78, thereby promoting
the HSPA5 ubiquitination and subsequent inhibition
of metastasis (Fig. 6). The mechanism of action is
controlled by the competitive acetylation of K353 and
ubiquitination of HSPA5, revealing a new mechanism for
the posttranslational regulation of HSPA5 expression.
E1A-mediated degradation of HSPA5 blocks cell
transformation may through UPR-independent pathway.
HSPA5 belongs to the glucose-regulated proteins
(GRPs) family, which includes the stress inducible
molecular chaperones GRP94, GRP170 and GRP75
[35]. With HSPA5 depletion or inactivation, UPR can
be spontaneously triggered through other molecules,
which illustrates that HSPA5 is not the only molecule
mediating UPR. When one mediator decreases, such as
HSPA5, other chaperons, such as GRP94, can maintain
the UPR response [35]. HSPA5 has different effects on
cell transformation and associates with aggressive growth
and invasive properties in various tumor models [3641]. HSPA5 knockdown has also decreased cancer cell
invasion in vitro and metastasis in a mouse model [37,
38]. HSPA5 overexpression increases the activity of focal

HSPA5 acetylation is mediated by p300 at K353
To investigate whether p300 is the acetyltransferase
for HSPA5, we used two different shRNAs to knockdown
p300 expression (Fig. 5A) and examined HSPA5
acetylation. As shown in Fig. 5B, depletion of p300
significantly inhibited HSPA5 acetylation. Moreover,
we transfected p300 with HSPA5 wild-type and HSPA5/
K353R mutant constructs and then examined the
acetylation status of HSPA5. p300 expression increased
HSPA5 acetylation in wild-type HSPA5 expressing
clones but not in HSPA5/K353R mutant clones (Fig.
5C). The above results demonstrate that p300 is the
acetyltransferase for HSPA5 and that the K353 residue is
critical for p300-mediated HSPA5 acetylation.

DISCUSSION
HSPA5 is an ER chaperone that assists in the
degradation of misfolded and accumulated proteins and
controls the content and accuracy of proteins. HSPA5
overexpression is frequently observed in many types of

adhesion kinase (FAK) and promotes the invasion of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells both in vivo and in vitro
[39]. Surface HSPA5 can bind to alpha2-macroglobulin
(alpha2M*) to activate PAK-2 and promote metastasis
in prostate cancer [40]. HSPA5 can also bind to uPAR
to activate uPA and plasminogen, facilitating cell
migration and invasion [41]. The above studies provide
the possibility that E1A-mediated degradation of HSPA5
blocks cell transformation through an UPR-independent
pathway.
Acetylation and phosphorylation have been
previously suggested to control the activity of the heat
shock protein family, including HSP90 [42, 43] and HSPA5
[31]; however, competitive regulation through acetylation
and ubiquitination has not been demonstrated. Three
major mechanisms are involved in the control of protein
stability following lysine acetylation. First, competitionbased protein stabilization with direct competition by
ubiquitin and acetyl groups on the same lysine residues
regulates protein stability. Second, acetylation-dependent
protein stabilization, where lysine acetylation in a protein
creates a high-affinity-binding site for other proteins,
such as E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes ubiquitination. In
contrast, a given acetylated lysine may attract a partner
to mask other lysines and protect them from E3 ubiquitin
ligase, preventing degradation. Third, lysine acetylation
may lead to complex dissociation and would thereby
render their components accessible to the action of protein
degradation machinery and promote complex dissociation
[32]. Our observations suggest that HSPA5 acetylation at
K353 prevents ubiquitination and degradation of HSPA5.
This finding supports direct competition between lysine
acetylation and ubiquitination as a major mechanism
regulating HSPA5 degradation. Indeed, a protective role
for lysine acetylation by preventing further modifications
has been suggested for crucial regulatory factors, such as
p53, p73, NF-E4, and Runx3. The same residues on p53
are the targets of protein acetylation and ubiquitination;
however, E1A expression stabilizes p53, disrupting
its ubiquitination through the association of p300 and
E1A [44]. Furthermore, the crosstalk between protein
acetylation and ubiquitination also has the potential to
affect transcription and intracellular trafficking. For
instance, while p53 ubiquitination is tightly controlled
by its acetylation, the regulatory mechanism is related
not only to p53 stability but also to its subcellular
localization (nuclear export) [45]. Recently, beyond the
ER, mitochondrial, nuclear, cytoplasmic and surface forms
of HSPA5 have been linked to cellular homeostasis and
therapeutic resistance [46]. The crosstalk between HSPA5
acetylation and ubiquitination regulating protein stability,
which we identified in this study, may further investigates
a role in HSPA5 cellular localization.
E3 ubiquitin ligase is the critical molecule in the
ubiquitin proteasome system that is responsible for
substrate specificity. Previous studies have indicated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that GP78 recognizes its substrate CYP3A4 via protein
phosphorylation [47]. However, we identified a different
mechanism for GP78 substrate recognition involving
competitive acetylation and ubiquitination that is critical
for HSPA5 stability. Based on our study, E1A-mediated
GP78 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity acts as a tumor
suppressor through HSPA5 regulation. Interestingly, our in
vivo results suggest that GP78 negatively regulates tumor
metastasis and tumor growth in response to E1A through
the HSPA5 ubiquitination.
Recently,
studies
have
confirmed
that
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key player in
breast cancer pathogenesis and that the inhibition of its
downstream AKT activity has the potential to decrease
breast cancer progression [48]. Interestingly, knockdown
of HSPA5 blocks downstream PI3K/AKT signaling and
has been reported to decrease prostate and leukemia
tumorigenesis [13, 37]. In our study, we demonstrated
that E1A significantly decreased HSPA5 expression in
three breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, HBL100
and HS578T cells. The identified mechanism suggests
that targeting HSPA5 for degradation may be a potential
therapeutic option for treating breast cancer.

forward and reverse primer, 1 Î¼M Universal ProbeLibrary
Probe (Roche), 1 Ã LightCycler TaqMan Master mix, and
2 Î¼l of cDNA. Amplification curves were generated with
an initial denaturing step at 95Â°C for 10 min, followed by
50 cycles of 95Â°C for 5 s, 60Â°C for 10 s, and 72Â°C for 1
s. All primers sequences of mRNA and probe are shown
in Supplementary Table S1. The GAPDH was used as the
reference gene. The relative levels of gene expression
were represented as ÎCt = Ct gene â Ct reference, and
the fold change of gene expression was calculated by the
2âÎÎCt Method.

Construct of expression vectors and plasmids
Full-length human HSPA5 (NM_005347) was
amplified by PCR using cDNA of HeLa cells and cloned
into the BamHI and XhoI site of pcDNA6/MYC-His
(Invitrogen). The N-terminal and C-terminal deletion
constructs of HSPA5 were further amplified from fulllength human HSPA5 and cloned as described above. Fulllength human GP78 (NM_001144) was amplified by PCR
using cDNA of HeLa cells and cloned into the BamHI and
XbaI site of HA tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Full-length
human Ubiqutin (UB) was amplified by PCR using pRK5HA-Ubiquitin (Addgene plasmid 17608) as template and
cloned into the EcoRV and XbaI site of pcDNA6/MYCHis (Invitrogen). The HSPA5 mutation (K352R, K353R
and K2R), and E1A mutation (E1A/Mut) were mutated
using a QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene). All primers sequences of cDNA and
mutation constructs are shown in Supplementary Table
S1. The lowercase was representative to the additional
sequence. Restriction enzyme site and mutation site
sequences were underlined. All constructs were confirmed

TRCN0000072244 that was shRNA against luciferase act
as a control, the pMD2.G plasmid and pCMVdeltaR8.91
plasmid were purchased from the National RNAi Core
Facility at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. The shGP78,
shCHIP, shCUL5 and shPARKIN plasmids were provided
by Prof. Michael Hsiao (Genomics Research Center,
Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan) as kindly gifts. Plasmid
pUK21-CMV-E1A was described previously [49]. The
E1A mutant carries point mutation (F66A and D68A) in
conserved region 1 (CR1), the critical motif be recognize
by p300 transcriptional adaptor motif (TRAM), to prevent
the interaction between p300 and E1A [50] and pCI-NeoGP78 R2M (Addgene plasmid 13304), pCMVb p300
HA (Addgene plasmid 10718) and pRK5-HA-Ubiquitin
(Addgene plasmid 17608) were obtained from Addgene
(http://www.addgene.org/).

Protein stability assay and Western blot analysis
For protein stability assays, cells were incubated
with cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit
further protein synthesis and incubated with MG132
(Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit 26S proteasome for the
indicated times, cells were immediately harvested.
Proteins in the total cell lysates were separated on
SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking,
blots were incubated with specific primary antibodies,
and after washing and incubating with secondary
antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were visualized
using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(PerkinElmer, Waltham).

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed by brief sonication in coimmunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4],
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1.2% Triton
X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors cocktails
(Roche). Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000
Ã g and the resulting supernatant was precleared by
incubation with Protein A (for rabbit antibody) or G (for
mouse antibody) for 1 h at 4Â°C. The precleared supernatant
was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation using the
indicated antibodies or control IgG antibodies at 4Â°C. The
next day, protein complexes were collected by incubation
with Protein A (for rabbit antibody) or G (for mouse
antibody) for 1 h at 4Â°C. The collected protein complexes
were washed five times with co-immunoprecipitation
buffer and eluted by boiling in protein sample buffer under
reducing conditions, after which proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting.

RNA isolation, reverse transcription and real-time
PCR quantification

Lentivirus infection

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturerâs instructions. Real-time PCR was
performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 (Roche). For
mRNA detection, PCR reactions contained 0.5 Î¼M of each
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by cotransfecting a mixture of the indicated expression plasmid,
the envelope plasmid (pMD2.G) and the packaging
plasmid (pCMVdeltaR8.91) into HEK293T cells using
10567

Oncotarget

Statistical analysis

PEI (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturerâs
instructions. The viruses were harvested from the culture
medium on day 2 after transfection and filtered with a 0.45
Î¼m filter. Cultured cells were incubated with lentivirus
containing 8 Î¼g/ml polybrene for 24 h, replaced fresh
medium and incubated for another 48 h. For stable cell
lines, cells were selected by puromycin.

All analyses were performed using SPSS software
(version 13.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc.). All data are
presented as the mean Â± standard error (s.e.m.) from at
least three independent experiments. The Studentâs t-test
was used to compare data between two groups. Statistical
analyses of inverse correlation between HSPA5 and
GP78 were performed using Spearmanâs nonparametric
correlation test. Survival curves were obtained using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to
test the difference in survival curves. p values of less than
0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Transwell migration and invasion assays
For transwell migration assays, 1 Ã 105 or 5 Ã 104
cells were plated in the top chamber onto the non-coated
membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 Î¼m; Corning
Costar). For invasion assay, 1 Ã 105 or 5 Ã 104 cells
were plated in the top chamber onto the matrigel-coated
membrane and the detailed procedure have been described
previously [26]. The numbers of cells that migrated and
invaded were normalized to the proliferation by MTT
assay for each cell line.

Cell tracing using a time-lapse microscope
imaging system
5 Ã 104 cells were plated in the 6 cm dish the day
prior to performing the cell tracing assay. The cells
were then placed into the incubation container at 37Â°C
in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 which is placed
on the stage of a light microscope (Zeiss). Seventy-five
pictures of living cells were taken every 15 min at 50 Ã
magnification. To analyze these data, Image J (NIH), was
used to count and track cells according to manufacturer
instructions. We took at least 20 single cells to calculate
the whole path distance to represent the migration ability
of these cells.

All animal work was performed in accordance with
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of China Medical University. Female
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (supplied
by LASCO, Taiwan), age matched and 4 to 6 weeks old,
were used in assays for lung colonization metastasis in
an experimental metastasis model. For experimental
metastasis assays, 3 Ã 105 viable cells were resuspended
in 0.1 ml of PBS and introduced into the circulation via
tail-vein injection. Lung metastasis was quantified 8
weeks after injection. The luciferase-based, noninvasive
bioluminescent imaging and analysis were performed
by the Xenogen IVIS-200 system (Xenogen, Alameda).
The remaining mice from each group were monitored for
survival studies.
