Abstract
Identification of the active component and mechanisms of
action of traditional medicines is highly desirable. We investigated whether zerumbone, a sesquiterpene from tropical
ginger, can enhance the anticancer effects of tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). We found
that zerumbone potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
human HCT116 colon cancer cells and that this correlated
with the up-regulation of TRAIL death receptor (DR) 4 and
DR5. Induction of DRs occurred at the transcriptional level,
and this induction was not cell-type specific, as its expression
was also up-regulated in prostate, kidney, breast, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Deletion of DR5 or DR4 by small
interfering RNA significantly reduced the apoptosis induced
by TRAIL and zerumbone. In addition to up-regulating DRs,
zerumbone also significantly down-regulated the expression
of cFLIP but not that of other antiapoptotic proteins.
The induction of both DRs by zerumbone was abolished by
glutathione and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and this correlated
with decreased TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting a critical
role of reactive oxygen species. Inhibition of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase but not of Jun NH2-terminal kinase abolished the effect
of zerumbone on DR induction. Zerumbone also induced the
p53 tumor suppressor gene but was found to be optional for
DR induction or for enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Both bax and p21, however, were required for zerumbone
to stimulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overall, our results
show that zerumbone can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the reactive oxygen species–mediated activation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase leading to DR4 and DR5 induction
and resulting in enhancement of the anticancer effects of
TRAIL. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6581–9]

Introduction
Many traditional medicines have been used for thousands of
years, and although they are safe and affordable, neither the active
components nor the mechanisms of action are understood.
Moreover, as many as 70% of all drugs approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration in the past 25 years have been based on

natural products. Zerumbone, a sesquiterpene, was first isolated
from the rhizome of a subtropical wild shampoo ginger (Zingiber
zerumbet) and determined to be an anti-inflammatory agent (1).
It was found to have anticancer activity against a wide variety of
tumor cells, including colon cancer (1, 2), leukemia (3), myeloid
cancer (4), and liver cancer (5), and to inhibit phorbol ester–
induced EBV activation (6). In vivo, this agent was found to
suppress azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci in rats
(2, 7), dextran sodium sulfate–induced colitis in mice (8), skin
tumor initiation and promotion in mice (9), myeloid tumors in
mice (4), cholecystokinin-induced acute pancreatitis in rats (10),
CXCR4-mediated invasion of breast and pancreatic tumor cells
(11), colon and lung carcinogenesis in mice (12), and human breast
cancer–induced bone loss in nude mice (13). How zerumbone
mediates all these effects is not understood, but suppression of
constitutive and inducible nuclear factor-nB activation and nuclear
factor-nB–regulated gene products has been shown by different
groups (12, 14). In contrast, zerumbone has been found to have
very little or no cytotoxic effect on the normal human endothelial
cells (3) and dermal fibroblasts (1). The cytotoxic effect of
zerumbone on leukemia cells was found to be mediated through
the induction of Fas receptors (3), leading to activation of
caspase-8. Whether zerumbone has any effect on apoptosis
mediated through other death receptor (DR) is not known.
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is
believed to regulate tumor cells killing through five different
receptors, but only two of them, DR4 and DR5, are transmembrane
receptors and mediate apoptosis. Engagement of DR4 and DR5
leads to the activation of caspase-8, which then leads to activation
of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (15–17). The activation of caspase-8,
also called FLICE, is inhibited by FLICE-interacting protein (cFLIP).
The evidence that TRAIL may have an anticancer role also stems
from the report that TRAIL deficiency accelerates the progression
of hematologic malignancies (18). Because of its selectivity toward
tumor cells, both TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against its
receptor are currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment in
combination with various chemotherapeutic agents (17).
Some tumor cells have been shown to be resistant to TRAIL,
and this resistance appears to be mediated through the loss of
TRAIL receptors, enhanced expression of caspases inhibitors such
as cFLIP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis protein, and survivin, or alternations in expression of
the Bcl-2 family proteins (19). Thus, agents that can up-regulate
TRAIL receptors and down-regulate antiapoptotic proteins have
the potential to enhance the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. In this
study, we sought to determine the effect of zerumbone on TRAILinduced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Our results show that
zerumbone can potentiate the apoptosis induced by TRAIL

(JNK). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with ERK1/2, p38, and
JNK to ensure equal loading.

Results
The present studies were designed to investigate the effect of
zerumbone on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. HCT116 colon cancer

cells were used for most studies, but other cell types were also
used to determine the specificity of this effect.
Zerumbone sensitizes colon cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. We determined whether zerumbone enhances TRAILinduced apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer cells. For this, cells were
pretreated with zerumbone (20 Amol/L) for 12 h, washed with PBS to
remove zerumbone, and then exposed to TRAIL (25 ng/mL) for 24 h.
The results indicated that zerumbone and TRAIL treatment
alone induced 11% and 5% apoptosis, respectively. Combination
treatment with both zerumbone and TRAIL enhanced apoptosis to
79% (Fig. 1A). When apoptosis was examined using propidium
iodide staining, we found that apoptosis was induced at 10.9% by
zerumbone, 18.7% by TRAIL, and 57.9% by the combination of the
two (Fig. 1B, left).
Whether zerumbone enhances the effect of TRAIL in long-term
colony formation assay was also examined. We found that, under
the conditions when zerumbone or TRAIL alone had minimal
effect on colony formation of HCT116 cells, the combination
treatment completely suppressed the colony-forming ability of
these tumor cells (Fig. 1B, right).
We also examined the effect of zerumbone on TRAIL-induced
cytotoxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method, which detects the mitochondrial
activity. For this experiment, cells were pretreated with various

concentrations of zerumbone for 12 h and then exposed to TRAIL
for 24 h. HCT116 cells were moderately sensitive to either
zerumbone or TRAIL alone. However, pretreatment with zerumbone enhanced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 1C).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

Next, we examined the effect of zerumbone, TRAIL, and the
combination on the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3,
and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. We found that
although zerumbone and TRAIL had little effect on the caspases
and PARP, the two together were highly effective (Fig. 1D).
Together, our results indicate that zerumbone can enhance
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Zerumbone induces the expression of TRAIL receptors DR4
and DR5 in cancer cell lines. To determine how zerumbone
potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we investigated its
effect on TRAIL receptors (DR4 and DR5). For this, HCT116 cells
were treated with different concentrations of zerumbone for
24 h, and whole-cell extracts were prepared and examined for
expression of DR4 and DR5 proteins. Zerumbone induced both DR4
(Fig. 2A, top left) and DR5 (Fig. 2A, top right) in a dose-dependent
manner, with optimum induction occurring at around 20 to 30
Amol/L. Whether this induction of the DRs was dependent on time
was also examined. Zerumbone induced both DR4 (Fig. 2A, bottom
left) and DR5 (Fig. 2A, bottom right) in a time-dependent manner.
To determine whether induction of TRAIL receptors by
zerumbone occurs at the transcriptional level, we examined mRNA
for DR5 expression after cells had been treated with various
concentrations of zerumbone. As shown in Fig. 2B, zerumbone
induced the transcript for DR5 in a dose-dependent manner, thus
suggesting that zerumbone acts at the transcriptional level.
Whether zerumbone enhances the expression of DRs on cell
surface was also examined. For this, we analyzed cell surface
expression of DR5 and DR4 in cells exposed to zerumbone. We
found that zerumbone increased cell surface levels of DR5 and DR4
(Fig. 2C). The level of DR4 cell surface expression induced by
zerumbone was lower than that of DR5. Collectively, these results
indicate that zerumbone up-regulated the expression of both DRs
on the cell surface.
We also investigated whether up-regulation of DR5 and DR4 by
zerumbone was specific to HCT116 or also occurs in other cell
types. For this, colon cancer cells (HT29 and HCT116), prostate
cancer cells (PC3 and DU145), pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1),
embryonic kidney cells (A293), and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231 and MCF-7) were exposed to zerumbone (20 Amol/L) for
24 h and then examined for DR5 and DR4 protein expression.
Zerumbone induced the expression of DR5 (Fig. 2D, top) in
HCT116, PC3, DU145, AsPC-1, A293, and MCF-7 cells. The
sesquiterpene induced the expression of DR4 (Fig. 2D, middle) in
HCT116, AsPC-1, A293, and MCF-7 cells. No significant induction of
DR4 was noted in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145
(Fig. 2D). Induction of either DR4 or DR5 was minimal in breast
cancer MDA-MB-231 and colon cancer HT29 cells after exposure to
zerumbone. Together, these findings suggest that the up-regulation
of DR5 and DR4 by zerumbone is not cell type specific.
DR induction by zerumbone is needed for TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. To determine the role of DR5 and DR4 in TRAILinduced apoptosis, we used siRNA specific to DR5 and DR4 to
down-regulate the expression of these receptors. Transfection of
cells with siRNA for DR5 but not with the control siRNA reduced
zerumbone-induced DR5 expression (Fig. 3A). Similarly, transfection of cells with siRNA for DR4 reduced the zerumbone-induced
DR4 expression (Fig. 3A). However, DR4 siRNA had minimal effect
on the zerumbone-induced up-regulation of DR5.
We next examined whether the suppression of DR5 or DR4 by
siRNA could abrogate the sensitizing effects of zerumbone on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis using an esterase staining assay (the

Zerumbone Enhances TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis

Live/Dead Assay). The results reveal that the effect of zerumbone
on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was effectively abolished in cells
transfected with either DR5 or DR4 siRNA (Fig. 3B), whereas
treatment with control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 3B). Silencing of
DR5 had more dramatic effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis than
that of DR4. The silencing of both receptors abolished the
apoptosis as much as silencing of DR5 alone, thus suggesting that
DR5 is a major player in TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Zerumbone down-regulates the expression of cFLIP but has
no effect on X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin,
and Bcl-2 family proteins. We examined whether zerumbone has
any effect on the expression of any of the antiapoptotic proteins.
Cells were exposed to different concentrations of zerumbone for
24 h and then examined for expression of cFLIP, X-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis protein, survivin, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 expression.
Zerumbone down-regulated the expression of both forms of cFLIP
but had little effect on the other antiapoptotic proteins (Fig. 3C).
Thus, it is possible that zerumbone affects TRAIL-induced
apoptosis not only through induction of DR4 and DR5 but also
through the down-regulation of cFLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8.

Zerumbone-induced up-regulation of TRAIL receptors is
dependent on reactive oxygen species. There has been a report
that TRAIL-induced apoptosis is regulated by reactive oxygen
species (ROS; ref. 23). Another study suggested that induction of
DR5 by agents such as curcumin requires ROS and exposure of
renal cancer cells to peroxide induces DR5 (24). We sought to
determine whether zerumbone-induced TRAIL receptors are also
regulated by ROS. As shown in Fig. 4A, pretreating HCT116 cells
with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced the
zerumbone-induced up-regulation of both DR5 and DR4 expression
in a dose-dependent manner. We also examined the effect of
glutathione on the zerumbone-induced expression of TRAIL
receptors and found that glutathione pretreatment abolished the
induction of DR4 and DR5 by zerumbone in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 4B). This suggests the critical role of ROS in the
induction of TRAIL receptors by zerumbone.
We next examined whether scavenging of ROS could attenuate
the TRAIL-induced cell death enhanced by zerumbone. As shown
in Fig. 4C, zerumbone significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in colon cancer cells, and pretreatment of cells with

Figure 4. Up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 by
zerumbone was mediated by ROS. HCT116 cells
were pretreated with various concentrations of
NAC (A) or glutathione (GSH ; B) for 1 h. Cells
were treated with 20 Amol/L zerumbone for 24 h.
Whole-cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by
Western blotting using DR5 and DR4 antibodies.
C, NAC reversed cell death induced by the
combination of zerumbone and TRAIL. HCT116
cells were pretreated with NAC for 1 h and then
treated with zerumbone for 12 h. Next, cells were
washed with PBS and treated with TRAIL for 24 h.
Cell death was determined by the Live/Dead
Assay. D, NAC suppressed caspase activation
and PARP cleavage induced by combination
of zerumbone and TRAIL. HCT116 cells were
pretreated with NAC for 1 h and then treated with
zerumbone for 12 h. Cells were then washed with
PBS and treated with TRAIL for 24 h. Whole-cell
extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western
blotting using relevant antibodies. h-Actin was used
as a loading control.

Figure 5. A, up-regulation of DR4 and
DR5 by zerumbone was mediated
through the activation of MAPK pathway.
Cells were pretreated with various
concentrations of PD98059, SB202190,
and JNK inhibitor for 1 h and then treated
with 20 Amol/L zerumbone for 24 h.
Whole-cell extracts were prepared and
analyzed by Western blotting
using DR4 and DR5 antibodies.
B, zerumbone-activated ERK. Cells were
treated with 20 Amol/L zerumbone and
whole-cell extracts were subjected to
Western blotting for phosphorylated
ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. The same blots
were stripped and reprobed with
ERK1/2, p38, and JNK to ensure equal
loading. C, zerumbone-induced ERK
activation is dependent on ROS. Cells were
pretreated with NAC (20 mmol/L) for
1 h and then exposed to 20 Amol/L
zerumbone for the indicated times.
Whole-cell extracts were prepared and
subjected to Western blotting using
relevant antibodies. D, blockade of ERK
reversed effect of zerumbone on
TRAIL-mediated cell death. Cells were
transfected with either ERK1 siRNA or
control siRNA. After 48 h, cells were
treated with 20 Amol/L zerumbone for 24 h,
and whole-cell extracts were subjected to
Western blotting (left ). Right, cells and
siRNA-transfected cells were pretreated
with 20 Amol/L zerumbone for 12 h and
then incubated with 25 ng/mL TRAIL for
further 24 h. Cell death was determined by
the PAPR cleavage. Equal protein
loading was evaluated by h-actin.

NAC markedly reduced this zerumbone-induced enhancement
from 73% to 20%.
Then we determined whether NAC pretreatment also attenuates
the zerumbone-induced increase in activation of caspase-8,
caspase-3, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4D). We found that zerumbone
enhanced TRAIL-induced cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase-3,
and PARP and that NAC abolished this increase, again suggesting
the critical role of ROS.
Up-regulation of TRAIL receptors by zerumbone is reversed
by inhibitors of MAPK. MAPKs, including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK,
and JNK, have been shown to mediate the up-regulation of DR5 by
bisindolylmaleimide and LY303511 (25, 26). We investigated
whether these MAPKs have any role in zerumbone-induced TRAIL
receptors. As shown in Fig. 5A, pretreatment of cells with an ERK1/
2 inhibitor (PD98059) suppressed the zerumbone-induced upregulation of DR4 and DR5 in a dose-dependent manner.
Pretreatment of cells with a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) also
reduced zerumbone-induced DR4 up-regulation but to a lesser
extent (Fig. 5A, middle). No effect of the p38 inhibitor was observed
on zerumbone-induced DR4 and DR5 expression. Compared with

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

inhibitors of ERK and p38 MAPK, JNK inhibitor had no effect on
zerumbone-induced DR4 or DR5 expression (Fig. 5A, bottom).
We also examined whether zerumbone can activate ERK, p38
MAPK, and JNK. We found that zerumbone activated ERK in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B, top). Zerumbone activated p38
MAPK transitorily between 1 and 2 h and declined thereafter (Fig.
5B, middle). No effect of zerumbone was observed on the activation
of JNK. Thus, the activation of these various MAPKs is consistent
with the results obtained with the effect of their inhibitors on the
zerumbone-induced expression of TRAIL receptors.
Zerumbone-induced activation of MAPK is dependent on
ROS. Thus far, our data indicated that ERK and ROS are involved
in expression of DR by zerumbone. Whether zerumbone-induced
activation of MAPK is also dependent on ROS production was
examined. To do this, cells were exposed to antioxidant NAC (20
mmol/L) for 1 h and then treated with zerumbone (30 Amol/L)
for indicated times and examined for MAPK activation. We found
that zerumbone activated ERK and the presence of NAC inhibited
the zerumbone-induced phosphorylation of ERK but had no effect
on activation of p38 MAPK and JNK (Fig. 5C). These results

Zerumbone Enhances TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis

indicate that zerumbone-induced activation of MAPK is dependent on ROS.
Silencing of ERK blocks DR up-regulation and TRAIL
sensitization. We next determined whether silencing of ERK
blocks DR up-regulation and inhibits TRAIL sensitization. To
examine this, HCT116 cells were transfected with control and
specific siRNA against ERK1. After 48 h, cells were then exposed to
zerumbone for 24 h and harvested, and lysates were subjected to
Western blotting. The result indicates that the expression of ERK1
was significantly reduced in cells treated specific siRNA when
compared with cells left untreated or treated with control siRNA
(Fig. 5A, left). The reduction in expression of ERK1 by the siRNA
correlated with suppression of zerumbone-induced up-regulation
of DR5 and DR4 (Fig. 5A, left).
Furthermore, siERK1 significantly inhibited the enhancement of
TRAIL-induced PARP cleavage by zerumbone. However, control
siRNA had no effect (Fig. 5D, right).
Zerumbone can induce p53 but is not required for
expression of TRAIL receptors. Numerous reports have suggested
that p53 can induce DRs (27, 28). We examined whether
zerumbone can induce p53 and, if so, whether this action mediates

the induction of TRAIL receptors. As shown in Fig. 6A, zerumbone
induced p53 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
To determine whether p53 is needed for zerumbone-induced
DRs induction, we used H1299 lung cancer cells that are deficient
in p53 protein expression. As shown in Fig. 6B (left), zerumbone
induced DR5 but not DR4 in p53-deficient H1299 cells, although
these cells do not express p53 protein. To clarify the difference
between results using colon and lung cancer cell lines, we also used
a HCT116 variant in which p53 is deleted. Again, we found that
zerumbone induced DR5 as well as DR4 in both wild-type and p53deleted cells, thus indicating that p53 has no role in the induction
of either DR by zerumbone (Fig. 6B, right).
To determine whether deletion of p53 modulates the apoptotic
effect of zerumbone on TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we examined
PARP cleavage. Enhanced apoptosis was observed when TRAIL was
combined with zerumbone in wild-type cells, but this was
unaffected in p53-deleted cells, suggesting that p53 induction
plays little role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C, left). The
enhancement of apoptosis by zerumbone, however, was abolished
in cells in which either p21 (Fig. 6C, middle) or bax was deleted
(Fig. 6C, right), suggesting the critical role of these two proteins.

Deletion of bax has no effect on up-regulation of DR by
zerumbone. Whether the deletion of bax modulates the expression of DR by zerumbone in HCT116 cells was examined. The effect
of bax on the expression of DR5 and DR4 induced by zerumbone
was investigated using bax-deleted cells. Results show that
zerumbone increased the expression of bax, DR5, and DR4 in
wild-type cells, but deletion of bax had no effect on the induction
of these receptors by zerumbone (Fig. 6D). These results suggest
that bax is not linked to the up-regulation of DR expression by
zerumbone.

Discussion
In the present report, we show that zerumbone, a component of
wild ginger, can enhance the apoptotic effects of TRAIL against
colon cancer cells. The mechanism by which zerumbone mediates
its effects on TRAIL-induced apoptosis appears to involve the
induction of TRAIL receptors and down-regulation of cFLIP, an
inhibitor of caspase-8. We found that the induction of DRs by
zerumbone was not cell type specific but was observed in a wide
variety of cell types, including colon, breast, prostate, kidney, and
pancreatic cancer cells. Induction of TRAIL receptors in some cells,
however, was much more pronounced than that in other cell types.
We found that zerumbone had no effect on human breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 and colon cancer HT29 cells. Both of these cell lines
are known to express mutant p53 (29, 30). Our results, however,
show that the lack of induction of receptors by zerumbone is
not due to mutation in p53. The mechanism by which this
sesquiterpene induces DR5 appears to occur at the transcriptional
level. We also found that zerumbone induces TRAIL receptors
through the generation of ROS as shown by our results that NAC
and glutathione abolished the induction of DRs. The results
regarding the induction of DRs by zerumbone through ROS are
consistent with those in previous reports regarding curcumin (24),
inactive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY303511 (26),
proteasome inhibitors (28), H2O2 (31), baicalein (32), and 15deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (33). We found that an increase in
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by zerumbone was also reversed by
NAC and glutathione. Apoptosis induced by TRAIL alone is also
known to be regulated in colon cancer cells through the generation
of ROS (23).
Besides the induction of DRs, the down-regulation of cFLIP by
zerumbone may also lead to the enhancement of TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Zerumbone was found to have little effect on other
antiapoptotic proteins, including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein, survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. Interestingly, like zerumbone, a
sesquiterpene, the synthetic triterpenoids 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean1,9-dien-28-oic acid and its methyl ester analogue have also been
shown to down-regulate the expression of cFLIP and to enhance
TRAIL-induced apoptosis (34, 35). In addition to terpenoids,
celecoxib and honokiol enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis through
the down-regulation of cFLIP (36, 37).

We found that the induction of DR4 and DR5 by zerumbone
required the activation of ERK1/2 and MAPK as shown by our
results that zerumbone activated these kinases and that their
inhibitors abolished zerumbone-induced expression of TRAIL
receptors. Given that ROS induces MAPK (26, 38, 39), it is possible
that zerumbone induces TRAIL receptors through the sequential
induction of ROS and MAPK. In contrast to ERK, p38 MAPK was
found to be involved in induction of DR4 but not that of DR5. JNK
was found to have no role in the induction of TRAIL receptors by
zerumbone. That activation of ERK1/2 by Ras can lead to the upregulation of DR4 and DR5 has been shown previously (40). In
addition, quercetin has been shown to augment TRAIL-induced
apoptosis through the ERK-mediated down-regulation of the
survivin signal transduction pathway (41). In our studies, however,
we found no effect of zerumbone on the expression of survivin.
The tumor suppressor gene p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis
in cancer cells. We found that zerumbone induced p53 protein
expression. Although p53 expression has been implicated in
the expression of DR5 (28, 42), we found that zerumbone-induced
DR5 expression was mediated through a p53-independent mechanism. No induction of DR4, however, was observed in p53-null
cells. That p53 plays a role in the up-regulation of DR4 has already
been shown (43). Thus, it is possible that the role of p53 in the
induction of DR4 and DR5 depends on the nature of the stimulus
and the cell type. We found that the ability of zerumbone to
enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis was unaffected by a lack of p53
expression in cells.
Overall, we conclude that zerumbone can enhance TRAILinduced apoptosis through the up-regulation of DRs and the downregulation of cFLIP. Considering that zerumbone when used alone
is highly safe and exhibits anticancer activities in vitro (1–5) and
in vivo (1, 2, 7, 9, 12) against a wide variety of tumors, we suggest
that it can be also used in combination with TRAIL that is in
clinical trials currently. Thus, these studies have an implication in
treatment of cancer by TRAIL, especially tumors that develop
resistance to TRAIL.
