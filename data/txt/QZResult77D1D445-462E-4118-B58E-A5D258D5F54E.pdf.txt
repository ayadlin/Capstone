BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling reportedly promotes tumor
malignancy and recurrence in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was demonstrated previously that the STAT3
pathway maintains the tumorigenicity and therapeutic resistance of malignant tumors as well as cancer stem cells
(CSCs). The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of the strong STAT3 inhibitor, cucurbitacin I,
in prominin-1 (CD133)-positive lung cancer cells. METHODS: CD133-positive and CD133-negative NSCLC-derived cells
were isolated from 7 patients with NSCLC. CD133-positive NSCLC cells that were treated with or without cucurbitacin
I were evaluated for their expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), tumorigenicity, stemness properties, and
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation. RESULTS: Compared with parental or CD133-negative
NSCLC cells, CD133-positive NSCLC cells had greater tumorigenicity, greater radioresistance, and higher expression
of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4), Nanog homeobox, and sex-determining region Y, box 2 (Sox2) at
high p-STAT3 levels. Cucurbitacin I treatment at 100 nM effectively abrogated STAT3 activation, tumorigenic capacity,
sphere formation ability, radioresistance, and chemoresistance in CD133-positive NSCLC cells. Microarray data suggested that cucurbitacin I inhibited the stemness gene signature of CD133-positive NSCLC cells and facilitated the
differentiation of CD133-positive NSCLC cells into CD133-negative NSCLC cells. It is noteworthy that 150 nM cucurbitacin I effectively blocked STAT3 signaling and downstream survival targets, such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-like 1 (Bcl-xL) expression and induced apoptosis in CD133-positive NSCLC cells.
Finally, xenotransplantation experiments revealed that cucurbitacin I plus radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic drugs
significantly suppressed tumorigenesis and improved survival in NSCLC-CD133-positive-transplanted, immunocompromised mice. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting STAT3 signaling in CD133-positive NSCLC cells with cucurbitacin I suppressed CSC-like properties and enhanced chemoradiotherapy response. The potential of cucurbitacin I should be

Lung cancer is 1 of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and has high incidence and mortality.1,2
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy play significant and crucial roles in the clinical treatment of lung cancer to achieve prolonged survival.3,4 However, a high failure rate and a short median survival are observed in patients with recurrent and intractable lung cancer who receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy.5 Therefore, novel therapies are needed urgently to
overcome resistance. Prominin-1 (CD133; PROM1), a 5-transmembrane glycoprotein, recently was identified as an

important marker of a subpopulation of cancer stem-like
cells (CSCs) in leukemia, brain tumor, retinoblastoma,
colon cancer, prostate carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.6-10 Eramo et al first demonstrated that CD133positive lung cancer cells have the ability to self-renew and
grow indefinitely as a tumor sphere.11 In another study of
small cell lung cancer (SCLC), Jiang et al demonstrated
that SCLC cells with high CD133 levels had markedly
enhanced tumorigenicity associated with the basic helixloop-helix transcription factor achaete-scute complex
homolog 1.12 In our previous study, we demonstrated
that nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-derived CD133positive cells displayed higher octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) expression and possessed the ability
to self-renew, potentially representing a reservoir of proliferative potential to generate lung cancer cells.13 Consistent with our findings, Bertolini et al also provided
evidence that CD133-positive lung tumor cells possessed
stemness features and a higher tumorigenic potential
than CD133-negative cells in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.14 A growing body of evidence
indicates the tumor initiation ability and chemoradioresistance of CD133-positive cells in lung CSCs. However,
the functional significance of the biomolecular pathways
that are overexpressed in lung CSCs remains unclear and
needs further clarification.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT), a transcription factor for cytokine signaling, is
constitutively activated in numerous cancer types, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, multiple myeloma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, brain tumors, and
lung cancer.15-18 Overexpression of activated STAT3 has
been detected immunohistochemically in NSCLC specimens.19 Tissue microarray results also indicted that phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) expression was correlated
significantly with vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) expression, implying the
clinical significance of activated STAT3 in the tumor progression and angiogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma.20
Bromberg et al reported that STAT3 mutations induced
cellular transformation and tumor formation in vivo and
that activation of STAT3 signaling further inhibited p53
transcriptional activity, fulfilling the definition of an
oncogene.21,22 Oncogenic STAT3 activation leads to the
increased expression of downstream genes that suppress
apoptosis (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2]-like 1 [Bcl-xL]), regulate cell cycle progression (p21, c-Myc, and cyclin D1), mediate cellular
invasion (matrix metalloproteinase 9 [MMP-9]), and

modulate angiogenesis (VEGF).23 However, the mechanism of the STAT3 signaling pathways and the possible
therapeutic targets involved in lung CSCs need further
investigation.
Cucurbitacin I (also known as JSI-124), a natural
cell-permeable triterpenoid compound, belongs to the
cucurbitacin family of drugs, which are isolated from various plant families, and other members include cucurbitaceae and cruciferae. Cucurbitacins have been used as folk
medicine for centuries because of their anti-inflammatory
and analgesic effects. Recent studies have reported that
cucurbitacin I potently inhibits cell growth through the
selective repression of tyrosine phosphorylation of
STAT3 (p-STAT3) in various human cancer cell lines,
including lung cancer.24 In view of these findings, we
investigated the clinical significance of p-STAT3 in
CD133-positive cells that were isolated from patients
with NSCLC. We also evaluated whether blocking
STAT3 signaling with cucurbitacin I could improve the
prognosis for patients with NSCLC by overcoming resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our
results demonstrated that cucurbitacin I inhibited the
CSC-like properties and enhanced chemoradiosensitivity
in CD133-positive NSCLC cells in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of CD133-Positive Cells
This research followed the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and all samples were obtained after patients provided informed consent. This study was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee/Institutional Review
Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The cells
from samples that were dissociated from the patients with
NSCLC were labeled with 1 mL CD133/L micromagnetic beads per 1 million cells using the CD133 cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, Calif). Because
serum-free medium culture allowed the selection of undifferentiated colon, glioblastoma, or lung cancer stem and
progenitor cells,8,11,25 CD133-positive cells were cultured
in a medium consisting of serum-free Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium (Gibco-BRL,
Gaithersburg, Md), N2 supplement (R&D Systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, Minn), 10 ng/mL human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF0 (R&D Systems Inc.),
and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (R&D Systems Inc.). To exclude potential contamination by
hematopoietic and endothelial cells, samples were examined using antiepithelial-specific antigen fluorescein

isothiocyanate (Biomeda). Then, the samples were
assessed by flow cytometry for purity.14 The medium was
replaced or supplemented with fresh growth factors twice
weekly until the cells started to grow and form floating
aggregates. Floating sphere cultures were expanded weekly
by mechanical dissociation followed by replating of single
cells in complete fresh medium.

ard errors (the standard deviation of pair-wise linkages divided by the square root of the number of linkages) of the
average linkage distances involved. Classic multidimensional scaling was performed using the standard function
in the R program (R Development Core Team, Vienna,
Austria) to provide a visual impression of how the various
sample groups were related.26

Irradiation and Clonogenic Assay
Ionizing radiation (IR) was delivered with a cobalt unit
(Theratronic International, Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at a dose rate of 1.1 grays (Gy) per minute (sourceto-surface distance Â¼ 57.5 cm). For a clonogenic assay,
cells were exposed to different radiation doses (0 Gy, 2
Gy, 4 Gy, 6 Gy, 8 Gy, and 10 Gy). After incubation for
10 days, colonies (> 50 cells per colony) were fixed and
stained for 20 minutes with a solution that contained crystal violet and methanol. Cell survival was determined by
using a colony-formation assay. The plating efficiency
(PE) and survival fraction (SF) were calculated as follows:
PE Â¼ (colony number/number of inoculated cells) 
100%. SF Â¼ colonies counted/(cells seeded  [PE/100]).

Western Blot Assay
The extraction of proteins from cells and Western blot
analyses were performed as described previously.27 Fifteen
microliters of sample were boiled at 95 C for 5 minutes
and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred
to Hybond-enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) nitrocellulose paper (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill) by using
a wet-transfer system. The following primary antibodies
were used: rabbit antihuman phospho-STAT3, rabbit
antihuman STAT3, rabbit antihuman cleaved poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, rabbit antihuman
cleaved caspase 3, rabbit antihuman CD133, and mouse
antihuman survivin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
Mass); rabbit antihuman LC3 (Novus Biologicals, Cambridge, United Kingdom); rabbit antihuman p21 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif); mouse antihuman Bcl-2 and rabbit antihuman Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and
mouse anti-beta actin (Chemicon, Temecula, Calif). The
reactive protein bands were detected by the ECL detection
system (Amersham).

Microarray Analysis and Bioinformatics
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Bethesda, Md), and the Qiagen
RNAeasy column (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) was used for
purification. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with
Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (GibcoBRL) to generate indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-labeled and
indodicarbocyanine (Cy5)-labeled (Amersham Biosciences Co., Piscataway, NJ) combinational DNA (cDNA)
probes for the control and treated samples, respectively.
The labeled probes were hybridized to a cDNA microarray that contained 10,000 immobilized gene clone cDNA
fragments. Fluorescence intensities of Cy3 and Cy5
targets were measured and scanned separately using a
GenePix 4000 B Array Scanner (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, Calif). Data analysis was performed using GenePix Pro 3.0.5.56 (Axon Instruments) and GeneSpring GX
7.3.1 software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif).
The average linkage distance was used to assess the similarity between the 2 groups of gene expression profiles, as
described below. The difference in distance between the 2
groups of sample expression profiles and a third group
was assessed by comparing the corresponding average
linkage distances (the mean of all pair-wise distances of
linkages between the members of the 2 groups). The error
of this comparison was estimated by combining the stand-

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,
Immunofluorescence Staining, and Terminal
20 -Deoxyuridine, 50 -Triphosphate Nick-End
Labeling
The activity of caspase-3 was determined using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems Inc.) and
was quantified at 490 nm (MRX microplate reader; Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, Va). Each individual sample
was analyzed in triplicate. The protocol for immunofluorescence staining has been described previously.27 Briefly,
an avidin-biotin complex method was used for immunofluorescence staining in the spheroid cells. Each slide was
treated with antibodies for p-STAT3 and antihuman survivin (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive signals were detected with a mixture of biotinylated rabbitantimouse immunoglobulin G and Fluoesave (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif). Positive cells were counted in 6 different fields by microscopy. Furthermore, apoptotic cells

were identified by using the terminal 20 -deoxyuridine, 50 triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method (In Situ
Cell Death Detection Kit, POD; Roche Boehringer
Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind).
In Vitro Cell Invasion Analysis and Soft Agar
Assay
The 24-well plate Transwell system with a polycarbonate
filter membrane was used (8 lm pore size; Corning, Flintshire, United Kingdom). Cell suspensions were seeded in
the upper compartment of the Transwell chamber at a
density of 1  105 cells in 100 lL of serum-free medium.
The opposite surface of the filter membrane facing the
lower chamber was stained with Hoechst 33342 for 3
minutes, and migrating cells were observed under an
inverted microscope. For the soft agar assay, the bottom
of each well (35 mm) in a 6-well culture dish was coated
with 2 mL of an agar mixture (10% DMEM [volume/volume], 0.6% fetal calf serum [weight/volume], and agar).
After the bottom layer solidified, 2 mL of a top agar-medium mixture (10% DMEM [volume/volume], 0.3% fetal calf serum [weight/volume], and agar) that contained 2
 104 cells were added, and the plates were incubated at
37 C for 4 weeks. The plates were stained with 0.5 mL
0.005% crystal violet, and the number of colonies was
counted using a dissecting microscope.
In Vivo Analysis of Tumor Growth and
Metastasis
All procedures that involved animals were conducted in
accordance with the institutional animal welfare guidelines of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. In total, 105
CD133-positive and CD133-negative NSCLC cells were
injected into the subcutaneous sites of nude mice (BALB/
c strain) aged 8 weeks. Cucurbitacin I (1 mg/kg daily for 5
days) was administrated in xenotransplanted nude mice

by intraperitoneal injection. In vivo green fluorescent protein (GFP) imaging was performed using an illuminating
device (LT-9500 Illumatool TLS; Lightools Research,
Encinitas, Calif) equipped with an excitation illuminating
source (470 nm) and a filter plate (515 nm). Tumors were
localized and dissected with the aid of GFP imaging. Tumor size was measured using calipers, and the volume was
calculated according to the following formula: (length 
width2)/2. The integrated optical density of green fluorescence intensity was captured and subsequently analyzed
using Image ProÃ¾ software (Media Cybernetics, Silver
Spring, Md).27
Statistical Analysis
The results are reported as mean  standard deviation values. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t
test or a 1-way or 2-way analysis of variance followed by
the Turkey test, as appropriate. Survival was estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared
between groups with the log-rank test. P values < .05
were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Isolation and Characterization of Lung
Cancer-Derived CD133-Oositive Cells
Recent studies have indicated that the expression of
CD133 in lung cancer results in high tumorigenicity and
a phenotype that is resistant to cytotoxic therapy.14,28 Our
previous results demonstrated that CD133-positive cells
isolated from patients with NSCLC exhibit greater chemoradioresistance compared with NSCLC cells of the
CD133-negative lineage.13 To further explore other possible characteristics of CSCs in CD133-positive cells from
patients with lung cancer, we isolated CD133-positive
cells (Fig. 1A) in tissue samples from 7 patients with

for 24 hours in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco modified Eagle medium/F-12 medium. The survival rate was determined by
using a 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Data shown are the mean  standard deviation
values from 3 experiments.

NSCLC using the magnetic bead method (Table 1). The
CD133-positive NSCLC cells that were isolated from
these 7 patients (Table 1) were able to form floating spheroid-like bodies in DMEM/F-12 serum-free medium
with bFGF and EGF (Fig. 1A). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated
that the amounts of stemness gene transcripts (Oct-4, sexdetermining region Y, box 2 [Sox-2], and Nanog homeobox) and drug resistant gene transcripts (multidrug resistance protein 1 [MDR-1], ATP-binding cassette subfamily
G, member 2 [ABCG2]) in CD133-positive NSCLC cells
were higher than those in CD133-negative NSCLC cells
(Fig. 1B). In those 7 patients, Patients 1, 2, and 3 with
highest percentages of CD133-positive cells (10.4%,
8.3%, and 5.6%, respectively) and the most robust in vivo
tumorigenicity were chosen for the experiments described
below. The ability to form spheroid-like bodies was significantly higher in CD133-positive NSCLC cells than in
CD133-negative NSCLC cells (P < .05) (Fig. 1C). To
evaluate the enhancement of tumorigenicity of CD133positive NSCLC cells, we performed Matrigel/Transwell
invasion and soft agar colony formation assays. CD133positive NSCLC cells derived from Patients 1, 2, and 3
displayed higher invasion activity and enhanced foci formation ability compared with CD133-negative NSCLC

cells from the same 3 patients (P < .001) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, xenotransplantation of 104 CD133-negative cells
into SCID mice did not lead to tumor formation; however, transplantation of 103 CD133-positive cells from all
7 NSCLC patients generated visible tumors 8 weeks after
injection (Table 1). Next, we evaluated the multidrug
chemotherapy-resistant abilities of CD133-positive
NSCLC cells and CD133-negative NSCLC cells. Compared with CD133-negative cells, CD133-positive cells
from Patients 1, 2, and 3 were significantly resistant to cisplatin, doxorubicin, and taxol (P < .01) (Fig. 1D).
To further determine the effect of radiation on the
tumor growth rate, we used IR doses from 0 Gy to 10 Gy
to treat parental CD133-positive and CD133-negative
NSCLC cells from Patients 1, 2, and 3. After IR treatment
(Fig. 2A), both the survival rate and the number of
CD133-positive NSCLC cells were significantly higher
than those in parental and CD133-negative NSCLC cells
(P < .001). These data demonstrated that CD133-positive NSCLC cells have a higher degree of radioresistance
(Fig. 2A). Because several studies have demonstrated that
STAT3 activation is related to the malignancy of lung
cancer, the correlation of activation status of STAT3 in
CD133-negative and CD133-positive NSCLC cells was
evaluated further. Immunofluorescence staining

demonstrated that CD133-positive NSCLC cells
expressed an elevated level of activated STAT3 (pSTAT3-tyrosine 705 [Tyr705]) compared with CD133negative NSCLC cells or parental cells in Patients 1, 2,
and 3 (Fig. 2B). Western blot results also revealed that the
level of activated STAT3 (p-STAT3-Tyr705) was higher
in CD133-positive NSCLC cells than in CD133-negative
NSCLC cells or parental cells from the 3 patients (Fig.

the characteristics and properties of CSCs, including tumor-initiating ability and chemoradioresistance as well as
increased expression of stemness genes and p-STAT3
compared with CD133-negative and parental cells.

Cucurbitacin I is a selective Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT inhibitor that blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of
STAT3 and JAK2 but not other oncogenic or survival
pathways, such as the protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways, in various cancers.24
However, it remains unknown whether cucurbitacin I can
inhibit the CSC properties of CD133-positive NSCLC.
The viability of CD133-positive NSCLC determined by a
3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay decreased significantly as the concentrations of cucurbitacin I increased (P < .05) (Fig.
3A). Treatment with cucurbitacin I also interfered significantly with the colony-formation (Fig. 3B) and migration
(Fig. 3B) abilities of CD133-positive NSCLC. Next, we
analyzed the genomic traits of CD133-positive NSCLC
that was treated with or without cucurbitacin I using gene

expression microarray analysis.26 The expression pattern
of CD133-positive NSCLC more closely resembled the
pattern observed in high-grade NSCLC tissues than the
patterns observed in low-grade NSCLC or normal lung
tissues (Fig. 3C,D); whereas CD133-negative NSCLC
cells, cucurbitacin I-treated CD133-positive NSCLC
cells, and low-grade NSCLC had profiles that more
closely resembled the profile observed in normal lung tissue (Fig. 4A). Notably, microarray analysis indicated that
the expression of 1132 probe sets was altered significantly
in the cucurbitacin I-treated group compared with the
control group when the hierarchical clustering method
was used (Fig. 3C). In addition, we used a literature-based
network analysis of all MEDLINE records (titles and
abstracts) and the Cytoscape open-source bioinformatics
software platform to group the target-linkage genes; and
the results indicated that interleukins, STAT3, and
STAT3-related pathways are involved in CD133-positive
NSCLC compared with CD133-negative NSCLC (Fig.
3D). To validate the microarray findings, the effects of
cucurbitacin I on STAT3 downstream genes and cell survival-related genes, such as survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Bax, were examined by Western blot analysis. The protein
expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin was down-regulated; whereas Bax production was enhanced by cucurbitacin I treatment (Fig. 3E).

closely resembled high-grade NSCLC tissues than low-

grade NSCLC tissues or normal lung tissues (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, the multidimensional scaling results indicted
that the expression patterns observed in CD133-negative
NSCLC, cucurbitacin I-treated CD133-positive NSCLC,
and low-grade NSCLC were closer to the pattern observed
in normal lung tissues. To examine whether CSC-like
properties are suppressed by STAT3 inhibition, CD133positive NSCLC cells were incubated with 100 nM or
150 nM cucurbitacin I for 24 hours. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis demonstrated that the quantities
of CD133 were decreased dramatically in a dose-dependent manner in cucurbitacin I-treated CD133-positive
NSCLC cells (Fig. 4B) (P < .001). The results supported
microarray data suggesting that cucurbitacin I inhibited
the stemness gene signatures of CD133-positive NSCLC
cells and facilitated the differentiation of CD133-positive
NSCLC cells into CD133-negative NSCLC cells and
low-grade NSCLC (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 4C) and TUNEL (Fig. 4D) staining also
revealed that apoptotic signals were positively correlated
with the cucurbitacin I concentration. To further investigate the biologic role of STAT3 in the tumorigenicity of
CD133-positive NSCLC under radiation treatment, we
applied various IR doses from 0 Gy to 10 Gy to vehicletreated or cucurbitacin I-treated CD133-positive NSCLC
cells. Figure 4E reveals that the survival rate of vehicletreated CD133-positive NSCLC cells was significantly
higher than that of 100-nM cucurbitacin I-treated cells (P
< .001). To explore the mechanism involved in the cucurbitacin I-mediated radiosensitizing effect against CD133positive NSCLC cells, the 100-nM or 150-nM cucurbitacin I-treated NSCLC parental cells or CD133-positive
NSCLC cells were exposed to 4 Gy IR. The capabilities of
colony formation and invasion (Fig. 4F) were attenuated
dramatically by 150 nM cucurbitacin I and by 4 Gy IR. In
addition, the combination treatment with cucurbitacin I
and IR produced a synergistic effect that abrogated these

CD133-positive NSCLC cell capabilities. The activity of
caspase 3 also increased concomitantly in CD133-positive
NSCLC cells that were treated with cucurbitacin I plus IR
compared with IR treatment alone (data not shown).
These data suggest that the STAT3 pathway maintains
the stemness of CD133-positive NSCLC cells and that
the inhibition of STAT3 activation further promotes apoptosis and inhibits radioresistance in NSCLC CSCs.
We also investigated the combined treatment effect
of cucurbitacin I and chemotherapy in CD133-positive
NSCLC cells. Experiments were conducted with cisplatin,
doxorubicin, 5-flouroracil (5-FU), or paclitaxel in vehicle-treated or cucurbitacin I-treated, CD133-positive
NSCLC cells. The data revealed that the cell survival rate
in vehicle-treated CD133-positive NSCLC cells was not
decreased significantly by the 4 drugs that were tested (P
> .05; data not shown). Conversely, cell survival declined
significantly after chemotherapy with the 4 tested drugs in
cucurbitacin I-treated, CD133-positive NSCLC cells (P
< .01) (Fig. 5A). The sphere formation ability of CD133positive NSCLC cells obviously was impeded by combined treatment with cucurbitacin I and cisplatin (Fig.
5B, left) or paclitaxel (Fig. 5B, right). These results suggested that cucurbitacin I can greatly increase chemotherapeutic effectiveness in CD133-positive NSCLC cells by
improving drug sensitivity.
Effects of Cucurbitacin I on In Vivo
Tumorigenicity and Survival of
CD133-Positive NSCLC Cells in a
Xenotransplanted Animal Model
We further investigated the role of STAT3 signaling and
the effects of cucurbitacin I in CD133-positive NSCLC
cells in vivo. CD133-positive and CD133-negative
NSCLC cells were transfected with a lentiviral vector that
contained the GFP gene (transfection efficiency was
80%).25 First, we injected 1  105 CD133-positive/GFP

Figure 6. Evaluation of the in vivo tumorigenicity of prominin-1 (CD133)-positive (CD133Ã¾) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cells and survival in a xenotransplanted animal model are illustrated. (A,B) In total, 1  105 NSCLC-CD133Ã¾ cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Six mice in each group received daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle (10% ethanol) or
drug (1 mg/kg cucurbitacin I [Cu.] in 10% ethanol). After 4 weeks, in vivo green fluorescent protein (GFP) imaging revealed that
transplanted NSCLC-CD133Ã¾/GFP cells grew solid tumors at the injection site. Tumor volumes in NSCLC-CD133Ã¾âtransplanted
mice that received either cucurbitacin I (100 nM) plus ionizing radiation (IR) (4 grays Gy) or cisplatin (Cis.) alone were significantly lower than the tumor volumes in mice that received IR or drug only (P < .01). (C,D) These charts illustrate (C) the number
of metastatic foci and (D) the total volume of tumors in the lungs of mice as determined by macroscopic analysis and histologic
examination. Cucurbitacin I combined with 4 Gy IR or cisplatin effectively reduced the number of lung metastases and tumor
size in NSCLC-CD133Ã¾/GFP-transplanted mice (P < .05 for CD133Ã¾/GFP vs all other groups). (E) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
also indicated that the cumulative (Cum) survival rate for mice transplanted with NSCLC-CD133Ã¾ cells that were treated with 100
nM cucurbitacin I combined with IR or cisplatin was significantly prolonged compared with the cumulative survival of mice that
received IR or drug alone (n Â¼ 6 in each group).

NSCLC cells or 1  105 CD133-negative/GFP NSCLC
cells into the subcutaneous sites of nude mice that received
different treatment protocols. First, the subset of nude
mice that received CD133-negative/GFP NSCLC cells
formed no tumors in the lung region within 8 weeks of
xenotransplantation. The subset of mice that received
CD133-positive NSCLC cells, but not CD133-negative
NSCLC cells, exhibited significant capabilities of invasion
and distant metastasis to the lungs (Fig. 6A). It is noteworthy that, cucurbitacin I treatment in CD133-positive/
GFP-transplanted mice effectively reduced the number of
lung metastases and tumor size in vivo (Fig. 6B,C). Furthermore, the tumorigenic and metastatic capabilities of
CD133-positive cells were decreased synergistically with 4
Gy IR or cisplatin in combination with 100 nM cucurbitacin I compared with cisplatin-only or IR-treated only
CD133-positive cells (P < .05) (Fig. 6C,D). KaplanMeier survival analysis also demonstrated that the survival
rate for the NSCLC-CD133-positive/GFP-transplanted
group was significantly improved by IR or cisplatin combined with cucurbitacin I compared with the untreated,
IR-alone, or cisplatin alone groups (Fig. 6E). Meanwhile,
in vivo xenotransplantation analysis revealed that
CD133-positive/GFP-transplanted mice that received
cucurbitacin I in combination with cisplatin or IR had a
better therapeutic response and prolonged survival compared with mice that received cisplatin combined with IR
(data not shown). Overall, this in vivo study indicated
that the effectiveness of radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic
drugs in mice bearing CD133-positive NSCLC tumors
can be improved significantly by adding cucurbitacin I
treatment.

DISCUSSION
Currently, surgery remains the most effective treatment
for NSCLC. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy has
been used increasingly to decrease disease recurrence and
metastasis. However, resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy is the major cause of treatment failure. STAT3, a
transcription factor that is regulated by various cytokines
and growth factors, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
EGF, is activated aberrantly in numerous cancer types,
including NSCLC. Recent reports indicate that the IL-6/
STAT3 signaling pathway may contribute to tumor progression and to the survival of CSCs, including CSCs in
glioma and colon cancers.29 Because the persistent activation of STAT3 promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival, contributing to tumor progression and migration,

abrogation of STAT3 signaling is emerging as a potential
cancer therapy strategy.23 The current results revealed
that CD133-positive cells isolated from 7 patients with
NSCLC had greater tumorigenicity, chemoresistance,
radioresistance, and expression of stemness as the level of
p-STAT3 increased (Table 1; Figs. 1, 2). We also
observed that 100 nM cucurbitacin I, a specific JAKSTAT inhibitor, efficiently inhibited cell proliferation
and induced apoptosis in CD133-positive NSCLC cells
(Figs. 3, 4). Our microarray results suggested that 100
nM cucurbitacin I inhibited the stemness gene signatures
of CD133-positive NSCLC cells and facilitated the differentiation of CD133-positive NSCLC cells into CD133negative NSCLC cells (Figs. 3, 4). In addition, we demonstrated that blocking STAT3 signaling by cucurbitacin
I significantly suppressed the self-renewal ability, tumorigenicity, and radiochemoresistance of these cells, suggesting that the activation of STAT3 plays a role in
maintaining the CSC-like phenotype of CD133-positive
NSCLC cells (Figs. 4, 5). Finally, our Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the treatment effect of cisplatin or 4 Gy IR for CD133-positive NSCLC can be
improved significantly by cucurbitacin I (Fig. 6). To our
knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the
STAT3 axis plays an important role in maintaining CSClike properties. Furthermore, this is the first study to
demonstrate that targeting STAT3 with cucurbitacin I
significantly suppresses tumorigenicity and radiochemoresistance in NSCLC-derived CSCs.
Resistance to chemoradiotherapy is the major clinical criterion for characterizing characterize CSCs.30
Recent studies have indicated that the expression of
CD133 in lung cancer represents a population of cells
with high tumorigenicity and a phenotype that is resistant
to cytotoxic therapy.14,28 Consistent with these findings,14,28 we have demonstrated that CD133-positive
NSCLC cells exhibit greater chemoradioresistance compared with CD133-negative NSCLC cells or parental cells
(Figs. 1, 2). Kruser et al demonstrated that panitumumab,
a monoclonal antibody against the EGF receptor, can significantly augment the radiosensitivity of NSCLC
through the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase and STAT3 pathways.31 Constitutively activated
STAT3 reportedly was detected in several human lung
cancer cell lines and in tumor cells that infiltrated the
pleurae of patients who had malignant pleural effusionassociated lung adenocarcinoma.32 Several reports have
indicated the synergistic effect of cucurbitacin with
known chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin and

gemcitabine.33 In the current study, our data revealed that
treatment with cucurbitacin I in CD133-positive NSCLC
cells effectively improved their chemoresistance to cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-FU, and paclitaxel (Fig. 5). Our data
also suggested that cucurbitacin I significantly induced
apoptosis in CD133-positive, NSCLC cells in part
through the inactivation of p-STAT3 and its downstream
effectors survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL (Figs. 3, 4). Furthermore, our data support the possibility that inhibition of
the STAT3 pathway by cucurbitacin I may significantly
block the migratory and metastatic ability of CD133-positive NSCLC cells in both in vitro and in vivo xenotransplanted models (Figs. 4, 6). Indeed, these data were
consistent with a recent report that IR enhances the invasiveness of and the events related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells by Bcl-xL
accumulation through STAT3, suggesting that STAT3
and Bcl-xL may contribute to the malignancy of lung cancer cells.34 Notably, in vivo xenotransplanted analysis
indicated that cucurbitacin I may be a sensitizer that synergistically enhances both radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity in a xenotransplanted model of human lung CSCs
(Fig. 6). Taken together, our findings indicate that the
antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and radiochemosensitizing effects of cucurbitacin I on CD133-positive NSCLC
cells could be applied as a potential strategy to overcome
the resistance of highly tumorigenic CD133-positive
NSCLC cells in patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, the actual biomolecular mechanisms of NSCLC
CSCs and CD133-positive NSCLC cells remain unclear,
and further investigations are warranted into both the targeting of JAK/STAT3 signaling and the radiochemoresistance involved in the CSC-related microenvironment
that has a biologic impact on NSCLC recurrence and
metastasis.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the
STAT3 signaling axis may be responsible for the CSClike properties and radioresistance of CD133-positive
NSCLC cells. Cucurbitacin I potentially may attenuate
the malignancy of CD133-positive NSCLC cells and may
present a potential clinical benefit for the treatment of
lung cancer and CSC. Thus, there is a great need to
unravel the underlying mechanisms of the STAT3 pathway in CD133-positive NSCLC and to further evaluate
the therapeutic possibilities of cucurbitacin I.
