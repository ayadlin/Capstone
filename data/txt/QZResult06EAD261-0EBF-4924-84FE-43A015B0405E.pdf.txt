ABSTRACT:
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a vaccine against tuberculosis(TB), has been
used and proven to be one of the most effective treatments for non-muscle invasive
bladder cancer (BCa). However, the mechanisms of BCG action have not been
completely understood, thereby limiting the improvement of BCG therapy. Vitamin
D deficiency has been associated with a high risk of TB infection, and the beneficial
effect of UV exposure in TB patients was proven to be mediated via activation of
vitamin D signals of innate immune cells. Thus, vitamin D signals might be involved
in mediating BCG immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we examined the impact
of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-VD) on BCG-induced response in BCa
cells and macrophage cells. Our data revealed that 1,25-VD promotes BCG-induced
interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion by BCa cells, consequently inducing the migration of
macrophage, THP-1. This THP-1 cell migration promoted by 1,25-VD can be blocked by
IL-8 neutralized antibody. Furthermore, 1,25-VD increased BCG-induced expression of
macrophage markers in THP-1 cell, and enhanced the BCG-induced THP-1 cytotoxicity
against low-grade BCa cells. Importantly, a pre-clinical trial using the N-butyl-N-(4hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN)-induced BCa mouse model revealed that intravesical
co-treatment of 1,25-VD with BCG can prolong mice survival. These data demonstrate
a novel mechanism by which 1,25-VD promotes BCG-mediated anti-BCa pathways and
provides a platform for improving BCG efficacy with combination of 1,25-VD.

INTRODUCTION

as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or mitomycin C, to
eliminate the residual cancer cells and prevent recurrence.
BCG was initially developed as a vaccine for
tuberculosis (TB) in 1921 and was used as an adjuvant
immunotherapy for BCa in 1976 [4]. Since then, BCG has
been the most effective adjuvant treatment for non-muscle
invasive BCa. It was proven that BCG can prevent tumor
recurrence and slow the progression to muscle invasive
stage [5], thereby yielding a higher survival rate than
TURBT surgery alone [6]. The mechanism of BCG in
BCa therapy is known to involve both innate and adaptive
immune cells. In brief, BCG is given intravesically, and
the BCG adheres to urothelial cells through fibronectin

Bladder cancer (BCa) is the fourth leading cancer
in prevalence and the eleventh leading cancer cause of
death in American men [1]. BCa ranks highest in cost
from diagnosis to death per patient [2]. About 80% of BCa
patients are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive tumors
[3], which include carcinoma in situ (CIS); Ta stage (lowgrade non-invasive); and T1 stage (invasiveness into
lamina propria). For non-muscle invasive BCa, patients
are usually treated with a transurethral resection of bladder
tumor (TURBT) to remove the existing tumors. Then,
patients undergo a series of intravesical therapies, such

[7] and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptors [8] followed
by internalization. Urothelial cells are then induced to
secrete cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha,
that recruit neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages [9].
Neutrophils play multiple roles in BCG therapy, through
directly eliminating tumor cells by secreting TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [10] and indirectly
contributing to tumor elimination by secreting cytokines
to recruit effector cells, such as T cells and NK cells [5].
In addition to neutrophils, several lines of evidence
suggest that macrophage actively mediates BCG-induced
anti-BCa activity. Following BCG installation, increased
numbers of macrophage, along with T cells, and natural
killer (NK) cells are observed in BCa infiltrates. In
addition to antigen presenting cells, macrophage also
acts as a cytotoxic effector against BCa cells by releasing
INF-alpha, INF-gamma, and NO after BCG stimulation
[11]. Those effector molecules are known to induce cell
apoptosis [11].
IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for proinflammatory mediator, and it is expressed by immune
cells and epithelial cells in response to BCG [12]. Urinary
IL-8 can predict BCG responsiveness [13, 14]. Also, IL-2
secreted from BCG-stimulated macrophages contributes
to the maturation of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic
T cells that serve as effector cells to kill bladder tumor
cells [15]. BCG stimulates innate immune cells to secrete
a panel of cytokine to further recruit adaptive immune
cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as NK cells
[16]. Then, Th1 cytokines are produced by both innate
and adaptive immune cells, including IL-2, TNF-alpha,
and INF-gamma, and these cytokines are required for
eradicating tumor cells [5].
One recent study confirmed that the BCG-induced
immune response in both innate and adaptive immune
cells is critical for BCG efficacy where pre-existing BCG
immunity improves BCG immune response to tumors in
mice. The results were further proven in BCa patients
showing that patients with pre-existing BCG response,
determined by positive purified protein derivative (PPD)
skin test, had a significantly better recurrence-free survival
after standard BCG therapy than patients with a negative
PPD skin test [17, 18].
The clinical BCG response rate in BC patients is
50-70%, and a significant amount of patients fail BCG
therapy. Currently, there is no biomarker to predict
the patient’s BCG responsiveness. Also, the majority
of BCG patients developed mild cystitis, including
urgency, malaise, and fever [19]. Interestingly, many
reports suggest BCG-induced symptoms are associated
with therapeutic efficacy [5], including cytokine release
in the urine [20] and cystitis symptoms. Occasionally,
patients may suffer from severe side effects such as a lifethreatening sepsis. Once severe symptoms occur, BCG
therapy may be postponed or withheld, and patients need
to take long-term anti-tuberculosis treatment to reduce
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the potential side effects [21]. Better understanding of
BCG functional mechanism is indeed greatly needed for
improving BCG therapy efficacy as well as development
of biomarkers for a better selection of BCa patients before
and during the therapy.
Accumulating evidence suggests that vitamin D is
beneficial to BCG vaccination against TB. Low serum
vitamin D level is associated with susceptibility to TB
infection [22]. Recent studies found that activation of
toll-like receptor 1/2 (TLR1/2) by mycobacteria, like
BCG, activates vitamin D signals by up-regulation of the
expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and CYP27 (the
enzyme that converts 25-dihydroxyvitamin D to active
1,25-VD), thus leading to the induction of antimicrobial
function [23]. VDR expression is detected in human
superficial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of bladder
[24]. Recent studies also indicated that low vitamin D
level is associated with the risk of BCa [25], and high
vitamin D plasma level protects against BCa. Therefore,
it is likely that vitamin D signaling may contribute to BCa
disease progression and response to BCG immunotherapy.
We examined the effects of 1,25-VD on BCGstimulated cytokine production, macrophage infiltration,
and the cytotoxicity against BCa exerted by infiltrated
macrophage. Importantly, we performed a pre-clinical
trial to test if 1,25-VD can promote BCG efficacy in a
carcinogen-induced BCa mouse model.

RESULTS
1,25-VD promotes IL-8 secretion by BCa cells
To understand if vitamin D signaling occurs in the
human bladder, the expression and distribution of vitamin
D receptor (VDR)-- the key factor that modulates vitamin
D activity-- were examined in human bladder samples
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. As shown in
Fig. 1A, we successfully detected VDR expression in
both normal human urothelium and carcinoma in situ
(CIS) so as to suggest a potential vitamin D action in
the human bladder. Moreover, we also detected VDR
expression levels in various bladder cell lines, including
immortalized normal urothelial cell line; SV-HUC; and
two high grade BCa cell lines; T24 (grade III); TCC-SUP
(grade IV) and one low grade HT1197 by Western blot
analysis. VDR is expressed in all the cells we examined
with higher abundance in HT1197 and T24 cells and much
less expressed in SV-HUC cells (Fig. 1B).
Following BCG instillation, urothelial cells secrete
a specific profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha [28, 29], which induce the first
wave of immune response, innate immune cell infiltration.
To test if 1,25-VD influences BCa cells cytokine
production, we examined the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and

TNF-alpha in BCa cells, TCC-SUP and T24 in response to
BCG and/or 1,25-VD; SV-HUC immortalized cells were
used as a control. As shown in Figure 2, BCG induced
significant IL-8 production, and 1,25-VD can promote
further the BCG-induced IL-8 secretion in both BCa cell
lines. In contrast, the immortalized SV-HUC cells have
very limited cytokine secretion in response to BCG and/
or 1,25-VD (Fig. 2). Contrary to IL-8, we found 1,25VD has very little influence on the BCG-induced IL-6 and
TNF-alpha secretion (supplement data, Figs. 1A and 1B)
in most of the cell lines we tested.

statistically more THP-1 migration than BCG alone (Fig.
3 upper panel).
To confirm whether the THP-1 cell migration
induced by BCG+12,5-VD treatment was due to the
elevated IL-8, IL-8 neutralizing antibody that blocks IL-8
action was employed. As expected, we found that IL-8
neutralizing antibody significantly decreased both BCGand BCG+1,25-VD-induced THP cell migration (Fig. 3,
lower panel). It was noted that IL-8 neutralizing antibody
can suppress both BCG and BCG+1,25-VD induced THP1 migration to similar levels, suggesting Il-8 is the key
pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in the THP-1
migration to BCa cells.

1,25-VD promotes BCG-induced macrophage
migration via increasing Il-8 secretion

1,25-VD increased the expression of activated
macrophage markers and inflammatory IL-8
expression

The pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by BCa
cells following BCG instillation would consequently
induce innate immune cells infiltration into the bladder
wall, and this first wave immune response is required
for a successful BCG therapy [30]. Therefore, the 1,25VD induction of IL-8 secretion by BCa cells could then
promote BCG-induced innate immune cell migration.
To test this, we performed a transwell migration assay
whereby we treated TCC-SUP cells with vehicle control,
1,25-VD, BCG, and BCG+1,25-VD for two hours, then
replaced with culture media for 22 hours incubation.
Afterwards, the conditioned media that served as
chemo-attractant sources were collected for migration of
monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cells. We found that BCG
treatment induced more THP-1 cell migration than vehicle
control. Importantly, BCG+1,25-VD treatment induced

Vitamin D signaling is known to be critical for
controlling mycobacteria infection through the regulation
of TLR signal in innate immune cells, such as macrophage.
Given the critical roles of macrophage in initiating an
effective response to BCG therapy, we determined the
expression of activated macrophage markers and cytokine
secretion in THP-1 cells in responses to BCG and/or
1,25-VD. Three activated macrophage markers, CD163,
Chitotriosidase (CHIT) and CD68, were examined when
THP-1 cells were treated with BCG and/or 1,25-VD. We
found that all three macrophage markers were significantly
induced by BCG treatment. CD163 and CHIT, but not
CD68, expression levels were further enhanced by

additional 1,25-VD treatment (Fig. 4) in THP-1 cells. With
respect to the elevated macrophage marker expression,
BCG also induces morphological alteration in THP-1
cells where the majority of BGC-treated THP-1 cells were
attached with a spindle-like morphology as compared to
undifferentiated state where cells are round and suspended
as shown in vehicle treated cells. Importantly, we found
more spindle-like cells were attached suggesting 1,25VD promotes BCG-induced macrophage differentiation;
unexpectedly, we did not see too much alteration in the
1,25-VD treated THP-1 cells.
Among those markers, CD163 was particularly
interesting; it was induced significantly in the
1,25-VD+BCG group. CD163 is a cell surface receptor
for bacteria and functions as an innate immune sensor
for bacteria. The recognition of bacteria by CD163 could
enhance inflammatory cytokine production in THP-1 cells
[31]. Therefore, we tested if the combination of 1,25-VD

with BCG could further induce cytokine secretion by
THP-1 cells. Since we had shown in Figure 2 that 1,25VD enhanced BCG-induced IL-8 production in BCa
cells, we now tested if 1,25-VD can further promote IL-8
production in THP-1. As shown in Fig. 4B, BCG increased
IL-8 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and this
induction can be further enhanced by 1,25-VD. These data
suggested that 1,25-VD promotes macrophage maturation
and activity in response to BCG.

1,25-VD promotes BCG-induced
cytotoxicity against BCa cells

It has been reported that BCG can induce
macrophage cytotoxicity against BCa cells [11, 32]. As we
showed, 1,25-VD can promote BCG-induced macrophage
activation and cytokine production. We therefore tested
if 1,25-VD can promote BCG induced macrophage cell
cytotoxicity against BCa cells. We treated THP-1 cells
with BCG and/or 1,25-VD, and conditioned media were
collected for testing cytotoxicity against BCa cells.
Two BCa cell lines were used: TCC-SUP and HT1197.
As expected, BCG-treated THP-1 conditioned medium
inhibited both TCC-SUP and HT1197 BCa cells growth
significantly. Interestingly, 1,25-VD increased the BCGmediated macrophage cytotoxicity against low-grade
HT1197 cells but it only slightly increased cytotoxicity
against high-grade TCC-SUP cells (Fig. 5). This cell
specific 1,25-VD impact on BCG-induced macrophage
cytotoxicity against BCa might be due to the lack of an
optimal cell environment for 1,25-VD action, and low
abundance of VDR expression in TCC-SUP cells (Fig.
1) as compared to HT1197 cells might be associated
with less 1,25-VD impact on BCG-induced macrophage
cytotoxicity against BCa cells.

Our in vitro results suggest that 1,25-VD promotes
BCG-induced innate immune responses and recruits more
macrophage cells toward BCa cells, thereby suppressing
BCa cell growth. To further examine whether the BCG
and 1,25-VD combination treatment can improve BCG
efficacy in vivo, a carcinogen (BBN)-induced BCa mouse
model was used [33]. BBN is a DNA damaging carcinogen
derived from tobacco smoke. It induces BCa arising from
urothelium in mice and represents a slowly progressing
BCa mouse model in which mice develop an early precancerous lesion that is similar to CIS (carcinoma in situ)
in BCa patients. A total of 24 mice were given BBN in
their drinking water to induce BCa. Following a 12-week
BBN treatment, mice were randomly grouped into four
treatments: vehicle control (100% ethanol); 1,25-VD (100
nM); BCG (1x106 CFU); or BCG+1,25 for 6 weeks, while

migration by a transwell migration assay. TCC-SUP cells were
treated with vehicle (ethanol), 100 nM 1,25-VD, 2 × 105 CFU
BCG, or in combination of 1,25-VD and BCG. Culture media
were replaced with fresh media after 2 hours’ treatment of drugs,
then cells were cultured for another 22 hours. The conditioned
media were collected and loaded in the lower chamber, and Thp1 cells after serum-free starvation were added to transwell insert
with 5 µm pore. After 24 hours the infiltrating THP-1 cells in
the lower chamber were collected and counted. (B) Blockage
of IL-8 by neutralized antibody reverses 1,25-VD-induced

as described in A, except adding IL-8 neutralizing antibody (20

The results showed that the BCG-treated group had
only a slightly better overall survival rate than the control
or 1,25-VD treated groups. Importantly, the combination
of 1,25-VD with BCG greatly improved overall mice
survival. The dead mice were found to have enlarged
kidneys with hydronephrosis and non-transparent bladder
tumor mass indicating that death was attributed to the
BCa-induced obstruction of the urinary tracts. This pre-

synergistically for higher therapeutic efficacy has been
used in clinics. In this current study, we demonstrated that
BCG and 1,25-VD combination therapy leads to a better
treatment efficacy than mono-therapy, which is clinically
significant. First, a significant number of BCa patients fail
respond to BCG, and BCG therapy commonly triggers
local irritation effects and in rare cases, systemic toxicity.
Second, the major limitation of systemic administration
of pharmacologic doses of 1,25-VD is hypercalcemia
side effect. Thus, this intravesical instillation of BCG and
1,25-VD combination therapy offers a unique opportunity
to improve current BCG immunotherapy while avoiding
the side effects caused by a single regimen at high
concentration. In our study, we found that 1,25-VD
can promote BCG-induced immune response; thereby,
possibly, we can lower BCG concentration to reduce BCGassociated side effects without losing its potency by coadministration of 1,25-VD. Importantly, the intravesical
administration of 1,25-VD provides the unique advantage
that allows the use of high 1,25-VD concentration locally
while avoiding hypercalcemia induced by high doses
of 1,25-VD given systemically. In this current study,
we chose to combine 1,25-VD at high concentration
100 nm with 1x106 CFU BCG, the lower end of BCG
concentration used in most animal studies [30, 34-36].
We showed that the combination treatment indeed has
better efficacy than BCG alone. We did not observe any
obvious toxicity or weight loss in the combination treated
mice. This pre-clinical study suggests that we can reduce
BCG concentration without compromising its anti-tumor
effects by combining it with a higher dosage of 1,25-VD
intravesically, through the mechanism involved in either
enhancing innate immune responses [23] or antitumor
effects [37]. A thorough pre-clinical study to determine
the optimal combination doses is of great interest.
Even though we chose a lower concentration of

BCG (106 CFU) in our study, we expected to see BCG’s
anti-tumor effect. However, in this BBN-BCa mouse
model, BCG treatment can only slightly improve mice
survival. In contrast to MB49 syngeneic model, one of
the most common mouse models used for BCG therapy
study, 10-6 to 10-7 CFU BCG can improve MB-49 BCa
mice survival [38]. One potential explanation for this
reduced BCG efficacy might be associated with less
availability of free fibronectin in this BBN-BCa model in
which BCG was given at a very early stage of disease;
fewer pre-cancer/cancer lesions are present, thereby
less extracellular matrix fibronectins can be released. In
contrast to the MB49 mouse model, the mice bladder walls
are wounded first to allow MB49 BCa cells to adhere. This
wounding process might also facilitate the fibronectin
release. Interestingly, 1,25-VD was reported to increase
fibronectin expression through a transcriptional regulation
[39], which could then facilitate BCG internalization and
yield better treatment efficacy.
IL-8 is a key prognostic marker for BCG
immunotherapy for BCa [14, 20, 40-42]. A clinical study
reported that patients who have detectable IL-8 in their
urine after intravesical BCG treatment have a significantly
higher disease-free survival [13]. Our data shows an
increased IL-8 level induced by BCG and 1,25-VD
combination therapy, thus enhancing the innate immune
cell recruitment that promotes therapeutic efficacy.
This result implies that a higher level of IL-8 in the
bladder microenvironment is critical for BCG treatment.
Therefore, to retain IL-8, for a longer period in the
bladder potentially could be a strategy to improve BCG
therapy. Previously, Zaharoff et al [35] demonstrated that
intravesical instillation of chitosan and IL-12 exhibited
a better therapeutic effect than BCG only, in which
chitosan serves as an adhesive adjuvant and IL-12 as
an immunotherapeutic agent with high potential to cure
cancers [43]. Chitosan is cationic-charged and posses
mucoadhesive properties, which enhance the adhesion of
drug to negatively-charged bladder mucosa. In addition,
its high viscosity can also enhance drug retention and
promote drug permeability into urothelium by loosening
the epithelial gap junctions [44]. Therefore, a combination
of chitosan with Il-8 intravesical treatment could be a
potential combination immunotherapy that needs further
investigation.
The regulation of IL-8 production by vitamin D
may vary under different physiological and pathological
conditions. Our previous study suggested that 1,25-VD
can suppress IL-8 production of prostate cancer cells
via blocking NF-kappaB activation [45]. However, in
this current study we found that 1,25-VD promotes IL-8
production only in the presence of BGC, suggesting this
1,25-VD promoting IL-8 is indirectly mediated through
BCG-induced pathway. It is known that BCG binds to
TLRs [46], which then induce the expression of an array
of inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL-8 [47].

Figure 6: BCG+1,25-VD increases the survival rate of
BBN-induced BCa mice. 24 FVB female mice were initially
given drinking water containing BBN at 6 weeks of age for 12
weeks’ treatment. Subsequent to BBN treatment, 6 mice per
group were subjected weekly to intravesical instillation of 100
μl PBS containing vehicle (ethanol), 100 nM 1,25-VD, 1 ×106
CFU BCG, or 100 nM 1,25-VD plus 1 ×106 CFU BCG. Mouse
survival data were recorded weekly. The difference in survival
rate was analyzed by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

Transwell migration assay

This activation of TLR signal by BCG could also activate
vitamin D signal by enhancing the expression of VDR and
CYP27beta1, and then inducing vitamin D downstream
target expression such as anti-bacterial cathelicidins [48].
It is reported that cathelicidins, such as LL-37, can induce
IL-8 production [49]. Therefore, the induction of IL-8 by
co-treating 1,25-VD could be mediated indirectly via the
activation of BCG-TLR downstream targets.
In summary, our study demonstrated a novel
mechanism by which 1,25-VD promotes BCG-induced
anti-BCa activity and this combination of BCG with 1,25VD provides a platform for improving BCG efficacy.

Migration of macrophage was examined using a
transwell assay. Thp-1 cells were cultured in serum free
RPMI medium overnight, then 5×105cells were added to
each transwell insert with pore size 5 µm (Corning Inc.).
The lower chambers, serving as the chemo-attractant
source, were loaded with 500 μl conditioned media
collected from the TCC-SUP cells treated with vehicle,
100 nM 1,25-VD, 5×105 CFU BCG, or combination of
BCG and 1,25-VD. Conditioned media were prepared
by exposing the TCC-SUP cells to two hours of drug
treatment, withdrawing the media and replacing them with
fresh RPMI containing 10% FBS and incubating for 22
hours. After 24 hours, the infiltrating cells in the lower
chamber were collected and counted. 10 μg/ml IgG or
anti-human IL-8 neutralizing antibody (R&D systems)
was added in the lower chamber to neutralize the IL-8
function in cell migration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Human urothelial immortalized cell line SV-HUC,
low grade BCa cells HT1197 and high grade BCa cells
TCC-SUP (Grade IV), T24 (Grade III) based on SRCCM
alignment [26] and human monocyte cell line THP-1 were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
Human neutrophil-like cell line HL-60 was a gift from Dr.
Nazzarreno Ballatori at the University of Rochester. All
the cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and L-glutamine
(10 mM; Gibco). BCG was purchased from Sanofi Pasteur.
1,25-VD was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

Cytotoxicity assay
HT1197 and TCC-SUP cells were seeded in 96-well
culture plates. Cells were treated with diluted conditioned
medium derived from supernatant of BCG and/or 1,25VD treated-THP-1 cells. Cell growth rate was determined
by MTT assay. Briefly, culture media were replaced with
fresh DMEM medium containing MTT stock solution
and incubated at 370c for two hours. Medium was then
removed, dissolving solvent DMSO was added, and
absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with
background subtraction at 660 nm.

Western blot assay
Western blotting analysis was performed as
previously described [27]. Briefly, cell lysate was prepared
from each cell sample, and equal amounts of protein
were resolved by electrophoresis in 10% or 15% SDSPAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Antibodies used
are human VDR (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), and beta-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA).

RNA isolation and quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen).
Reverse transcription was performed with iScript Master
Mix (BioRad). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as
previously described using iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix
with CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad).
Gene expression was analyzed by using CFX manager
software normalizing the expression to two housekeeping
genes, beta-actin and GAPDH. Primer design for CD68,
CD163, CHIT-1, and IL-8 is from the PrimerBank (http://
pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank).

ELISA assay
2×105 BCa cells or THP-1 cells were seeded in
each well of a 24-well plate. The cells were treated
with vehicle, 100 nM 1,25-VD, 2×106 CFU/mL BCG,
or a combination of 100 nM 1,25-VD and 2×106 CFU/
mL BCG. After 24 hours of treatment, the conditioned
medium were harvested, filtered through a 0.22 μm filter,
and stored in -800C for determination of pro-inflammatory
cytokine levels including IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-alpha by
ELISA assay (eBioScience).

carcinogen-induced BCa model in mice, 24 FVB female
mice at six weeks of age were given drinking water ad
libitum containing 0.05 % BBN (TCI America, Portland,
OR) twice a week for 12 weeks. After completing BBN
treatment, mice were subjected to four treatments of
intravesical instillation: (1) vehicle control (ethanol); (2)
100 μM 1,25-VD; (3) 106 CFU BCG; or (4) 100 μM 1,25VD combined with 106 CFU BCG. The drugs remained
in the bladder lumens for one hour while animals were
kept under isoflurane anesthesia. Intravesical treatments
were administered once a week for six weeks. The mice
survival rate was monitored.

Statistical analysis
Differences in mean values between the two
(control) groups were analyzed by a two-tailed Student’s
T test. Differences in the survival rates of mice with BCa
between the two groups were analyzed by a Log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
