Abstract

Author Manuscript

Chromosome instability (CIN) is a hallmark of many tumors and correlates with the presence of
extra centrosomes1-4. However, a direct mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN has
not been established. It has been proposed that extra centrosomes generate CIN by promoting
multipolar anaphase, a highly abnormal division that produces 3 or more aneuploid daughter cells.
Here, we use long-term live-cell imaging to demonstrate that cells with multiple centrosomes
rarely undergo multipolar cell divisions, and the progeny of these divisions are typically inviable.
Thus, multipolar divisions cannot explain observed rates of CIN. By contrast, we observe that CIN
cells with extra centrosomes routinely undergo bipolar cell divisions, but display a significantly
elevated frequency of lagging chromosomes during anaphase. To define the mechanism
underlying this mitotic defect, we generated cells that differ only in their centrosome number. We
demonstrate that extra centrosomes alone are sufficient to promote chromosome missegregation
during bipolar cell division. These segregation errors are a consequence of cells passing through a
transient ‘multipolar spindle intermediate’ in which merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment
errors accumulate prior to centrosome clustering and anaphase. These findings provide a direct
mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN, two common characteristics of solid
tumors. We propose that this mechanism may be a common underlying cause of CIN in human
cancer.

A conspicuous feature of many tumor cells is an elevated rate of gain or loss of whole
chromosomes, a phenomenon referred to as chromosome instability1. Cells with CIN
missegregate chromosomes 10-100 times more frequently than non-transformed or
chromosomally stable diploid cancers cells. CIN is thus a major source of aneuploidy 1, 5
and has important implications not only for tumor initiation, where aneuploidy can play a

causal role 6, but also for tumor cell evolution, where elevated rates of chromosome
missegregation may enable clonal expansion of cells with proliferative advantages,
metastatic potential, or chemoresistance 5, 7, 8. Despite its importance, the mechanisms
leading to CIN in most cancers are not defined.

One proposed mechanism underlying CIN is through extra centrosome-mediated multipolar
spindle assembly followed by asymmetric chromosome segregation resulting in massive
aneuploidy 3. Correlative support for this idea comes from the fact that extra centrosomes
and multipolar mitotic figures are common in CIN cancers, yet rare in chromosomally stable
tumors 9-12. However, an obvious paradox arises when considering such multipolar cell
division as an underlying mechanism of CIN: aneuploidy compromises cell fitness 6, 13, 14
and therefore massive aneuploidy following multipolar cell division would likely
compromise viability 3, 15-17. To date, neither the frequency of multipolar divisions nor the
fate of the resulting progeny has been systematically characterized in cancer cells.
To directly visualize the relationship between multipolar cell division and cell viability, we
generated a variety of cancer cell lines from different tissues of origin that stably express the
chromosome marker H2B-GFP and performed long-term live cell imaging. The percentage
of cells that harbored extra centrosomes varied significantly, from ∼12% in HT-29 human
colon cancer cells to 100% in mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells (Fig.1a). Nevertheless,
our analysis clearly indicated that the fraction of cells undergoing multipolar cell division,
defined by the segregation of chromosomes to 3 or more poles during anaphase, was always
markedly less than the fraction of cells possessing extra centrosomes (Fig.1a). Thus, as
expected from previous work, clustering of supernumerary centrosomes into two poles is an
efficient mechanism that limits multipolar cell division 3, 15-19.

We determined the fate of cells that underwent a multipolar anaphase. We observed that
although multipolar anaphase often produced 3 or more mononucleated daughter cells,
cytokinesis failure along one or both division planes to produce binucleate or polynucleate
progeny was also common (Supp. Fig. 1a). Both mono- and polynucleated progeny (P1) of
spontaneously arising multipolar divisions were then tracked over a 4-day period and
classified as: 1) Undergoing mitotic cell death with a multipolar spindle configuration; 2)
Dying during the subsequent interphase; 3) Undergoing cell-cycle arrest; or 4) Successfully
completing a second round of cell division to generate P2 progeny (Fig. 1b, c). Strikingly,
we found that the vast majority of progeny (P1) of multipolar cells died or arrested,
regardless of tissue of origin or whether the cells were mono- or polynucleated (Fig. 1b, c, d,
Supp. Fig. 1a, b, Supp. Movie 1). Moreover, when rare P1 progeny from multipolar
divisions completed a second round of mitosis to generate P2 progeny, even fewer of the
resulting daughter cells were capable of further division (Fig. 1b, c). Finally, we observed
that progeny from multipolar divisions were usually inviable even if they were born from
binucleated, presumably tetraploid, mother cells. This suggests that doubling the
chromosome content does not efficiently buffer the deleterious effects of massive
aneuploidy that results from multipolar anaphase (Supp. Fig. 2).
Taken together, these data provide two reasons why multipolar cell division alone cannot
explain the high rates of chromosome missegregation in CIN cells. First, the frequencies of

multipolar division are not high enough to account for the observed rates of chromosome
missegregation in these cell lines: For example, whereas MCF-7 and HT-29 cells
missegregate chromosomes on average once every 2 or 5 divisions, respectively 1, 13, they
each undergo multipolar anaphase only once every 50 or more divisions. Second, the failure
of progeny to continue proliferating reveals that multipolar mitosis cannot give rise to
persistently unstable cells.

We therefore considered other mechanisms by which multiple centrosomes might generate
CIN. Recent work has revealed that merotely, a type of error in which single kinetochores
attach to microtubules emanating from different poles 20, 21, is common in CIN cells 13.
Merotelic attachments are particularly dangerous because they are poorly sensed by the
spindle assembly checkpoint and, if not corrected, may give rise to lagging chromosomes
during anaphase that can lead to missegregation events 20-23. However, the cause of
merotely in CIN cancers is unknown.
We hypothesized that cells with extra centrosomes pass through transient multipolar
intermediates prior to centrosome clustering and that the geometry of such intermediates
predisposes to merotelic attachments. Supporting this idea, we found that CIN cells with
extra centrosomes spend a majority of mitosis in a multipolar configuration prior to
centrosome clustering (Supp. Fig. 3), and, furthermore, we directly observed numerous
merotelic attachments within multipolar spindles by high-resolution microscopy (Fig. 2a,
Supp. Fig. 8). Moreover, as observed in tetraploid PtK1 cells 24, 25, both the frequency and
number of lagging chromosomes are dramatically elevated in rare cells that undergo
multipolar anaphase, indicating that merotelic attachments are enriched within the
multipolar configuration (Supp. Fig. 4, Supp. Movie 2).

Author Manuscript

As a further test of the hypothesis, a panel of CIN cell lines was analyzed by fixed-cell
imaging and scored for both lagging chromosomes (markers for merotelic attachment) and
centrosome number during mid-anaphase (Fig. 2b, c). The presence of extra centrosomes
during bipolar anaphase correlated with a significant increase (3-10 fold) in the frequency of
lagging chromosomes in every cell line examined, consistent with the idea that extra
centrosomes increase the formation of merotelic attachments that can persist through
anaphase (Fig. 2b, c).

Author Manuscript

We next tested whether extra centrosomes alone are sufficient to promote chromosome
missegregation during bipolar cell division. A significant technical challenge for studying
the consequences of centrosome amplification has been the difficulty in obtaining
genetically matched cells that do or do not contain extra centrosomes. We circumvented this
problem in two ways. First, we generated tetraploid cells with extra centrosomes by using
cytochalasin D to inhibit cytokinesis in chromosomally stable non-transformed telomerase
immortalized human BJ and RPE1 cell lines. Since non-transformed cells are prone to cellcycle arrest after tetraploidization, we transiently knocked down p53 by siRNA to facilitate
passage of tetraploids through mitosis. Like cancer cells, tetraploid cells clustered their extra
centrosomes into two poles during the subsequent mitosis and displayed a significantly
increased frequency of anaphase lagging chromosomes during bipolar anaphase relative to
matched diploids that were also exposed to cytochalasin and depleted of p53 (Fig. 3a, c).

Interestingly, both tetraploid BJ and RPE-1 cells spontaneously lost their extra centrosomes
after passage in culture (Fig. 3a and data not shown). We therefore used sequential FACS
sorting to isolate pure populations of tetraploid cells with a normal complement of
centrosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and karyotyping demonstrated that
these cells contained a tetraploid complement of chromosomes (Fig. 3b, Supp. Fig. 5).
Consequently, this procedure generated pure populations of tetraploids with only 2
centrosomes during mitosis and allowed us to compare the rate of lagging chromosomes in
tetraploid cells possessing 2 or >2 centrosomes. Strikingly, the loss of extra centrosomes
was accompanied by a decrease in the fraction of cells with lagging chromosomes to a level
observed in diploid cells (Fig. 3a, c). These findings strongly suggest that the increased rate
of lagging chromosomes in newly generated tetraploid cells is due to extra centrosomes
rather than a duplicated genome.

To determine if the observed increases in lagging chromosomes in cells containing extracentrosomes leads to chromosome missegregation, we used anaphase/telophase FISH to
measure the rate of chromosome missegregation in BJ fibroblasts and RPE-1 cells (Fig. 3b,
d). To ensure that cells with extra centrosomes passed through a bipolar mitosis, FISH
signals were only scored in anaphase or telophase cells in which the daughters each
possessed a single nucleus. The missegregation rates per chromosome in diploid, newly
generated tetraploid, and late-passage tetraploid cells closely mirrored the results obtained
by scoring lagging chromosomes as tetraploids with >2 centrosomes showed missegregation
rates ∼6-8 fold higher than diploids or tetraploids with 2 centrosomes (Fig. 3d). These rates
correspond to 1 chromosome missegregation for every ∼6 divisions in tetraploid BJ
fibroblasts with >2 centrosomes, compared to 1 chromosome missegregation for every ∼50
divisions in tetraploids with 2 centrosomes. Thus, extra centrosomes promote chromosome
missegregation even after cells cluster centrosomes to assemble bipolar spindles.

Author Manuscript

Although the above data suggest that the majority of missegregation events can be explained
by merotelic attachments and lagging chromosomes, some missegregation events in cells
with extra centrosomes may, at low frequency, arise by other mechanisms. For example, we
occasionally observed single chromosomes bi-orienting between two inefficiently clustered
centrosomes even after all other chromosomes had aligned at the metaphase plate (see Fig
3a, top row, middle panel). Presumably, these bi-oriented polar chromosomes could be
under tension, satisfy the SAC, and thus segregate both sisters to a single daughter upon
anaphase entry 4. Indeed, in tetraploid RPE1 cells, we did identify a single such example by
live-cell imaging (Supp. Fig. 6, Supp. Movie 3). However, this mechanism does not occur
frequently enough to contribute significantly to chromosome missegregation in the extracentrosomal cells we examined: We did not observe a single such bi-oriented chromosome
during anaphase in any of our fixed-cell samples, and only a very minor fraction of the
∼8000 CIN cell divisions we imaged by H2B-GFP showed chromosomes at the poles
during anaphase onset, consistent with previous imaging analyses 13, 26.
Finally, we designed an experiment where, in otherwise genetically identical cells, we could
directly test the hypothesis that transient multipolar spindle intermediates generate anaphase
lagging chromosomes. We recognized that this could be accomplished by monitoring
mitosis over 2 generations after induction of PLK4, a kinase that regulates centriole

replication and whose overexpression has previously been shown to cause centriole
amplification 27. To do this, we used an U2OS osteosarcoma cell line in which PLK4
expression is regulated by a doxycycline-inducible promoter 27. After a 15 hr. induction of
PLK4, cells contained two ‘rosettes’ of overduplicated centrioles, each comprised of a
mother centriole surrounded by numerous daughter centrioles 27 (Fig. 4a). Importantly,
because the extra centrioles assembled before mitosis, they remained engaged and
functioned as single units to enable bipolar spindle assembly without a multipolar spindle
intermediate (Fig. 4a, b). In these cells, despite centriole amplification, the frequency of
lagging chromosomes was similar to that observed in control cells with 2 centrosomes (Fig.
4b). By contrast, in the second cell cycle after centriole overduplication, supernumerary
centrioles disengaged prior to duplication 28 and multipolar intermediates were common in
the mitosis that followed (Fig. 4a, b). In these cells, a marked increase in the frequency of
lagging chromosomes was observed following centrosome clustering and the onset of
bipolar anaphase (Fig. 4b). Thus, extra centrosomes force cells to pass through a multipolar
spindle intermediate and thereby enhance the formation of merotelic attachments and
lagging chromosomes.

Author Manuscript

We propose that extra centrosomes generate CIN primarily by promoting merotelic
kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This is due to the unique spindle geometry that occurs
when cells resolve transient multipolar intermediates into bipolar spindles, in a manner
broadly similar to what occurs during spindle assembly after nocodazole or monastrol
washout 20, 23 (Fig. 4c). Moreover, syntelic attachments (both sister kinetochores attached
to the same pole) are also expected to be enriched when chromosomes bi-orient between two
centrosomes that eventually cluster (Fig. 4c), and these syntelic attachments may promote
further merotely (Supp. Movie 4) 21, 23. Many of these merotelic attachment errors are
corrected prior to anaphase by mechanisms that involve the release or destabilization of
inappropriately attached microtubules 20, 21, 29; this can be inferred by the dramatic
decrease in the frequency and number of lagging chromosomes observed in cells that enter
mitosis from a multipolar configuration rather than a bipolar configuration (Supp. Fig. 4c),
or by directly quantifying the number of merotelic attachments before and after centrosome
clustering (Supp. Fig. 8). However, the overall increase in the number of initial merotelic
attachments during the multipolar spindle intermediate reduces the likelihood that all errors
will be corrected prior to anaphase onset, thereby causing a net increase in the frequency of
lagging chromosomes and chromosome missegregation errors 13.

Author Manuscript

In sum, we have demonstrated that extra centrosomes are not simply innocent bystanders in
CIN cells; rather, their presence directly promotes chromosome missegregation that may
then facilitate the evolution of more malignant phenotypes. This finding clarifies the
longstanding correlation between centrosome amplification and CIN, and provides one
simple and unifying explanation for the observed high rates of merotely in CIN cancers.
Previously, a variety of genetic mutations have been implicated as causes of CIN, but these
defects appear to be relatively infrequent 30. By contrast, extra centrosomes are prevalent
among CIN cells, and we suggest that the mechanism described here is a common
contributor to chromosomal instability in human cancer.

Methods Summary
All cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. Immunofluorescence
microscopy was performed as previously described 17. Fixed cell images were collected by
confocal immunofluorescence on a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal mounted on
a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments). Live-cell imaging was performed
using a TE2000-E2 inverted Nikon microscope equipped with the Nikon Perfect Focus
system enclosed within a temperature and CO2-controlled environment that maintained an
atmosphere of 37°C and 3-5% humidified CO2. Sequential FACS sorting of tetraploids with
8c DNA content was used to generate tetraploid cells with two centrosomes. Detailed
descriptions of FISH, karyotyping, imaging, cell lines, culture conditions, and antibodies
used in this study can be found in supplementary methods.
