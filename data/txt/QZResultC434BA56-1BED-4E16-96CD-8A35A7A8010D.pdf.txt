Abstract
Interleukin (IL)-6 overexpression and constitutive STAT3 activation occur in many cancers, including prostate
cancer. However, their contribution to prostate stem and progenitor cells has not been explored. In this study,
we show that stem-like cells from patients with prostate cancer secrete higher levels of IL-6 than their
counterparts in non-neoplastic prostate. Tumor grade did not inﬂuence the levels of expression or secretion.
Stem-like and progenitor cells expressed the IL-6 receptor gp80 with concomitant expression of pSTAT3.
Blockade of activated STAT3, by either anti-IL-6 antibody siltuximab (CNTO 328) or LLL12, a speciﬁc pSTAT3
inhibitor, suppressed the clonogenicity of the stem-like cells in patients with high-grade disease. In a murine
xenograft model used to determine the in vivo effects of pSTAT3 suppression, LLL12 treatment effectively
abolished outgrowth of a patient-derived castrate-resistant tumor. Our results indicate that the most primitive
cells in prostate cancer require pSTAT3 for survival, rationalizing STAT3 as a therapeutic target to treat advanced
prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5288–98. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men (1).
Although the disease often responds initially to androgenablation therapy, the cancer recurs in the majority of patients.
For these patients with castration-resistant disease, few therapeutic options exist, thus novel therapies are urgently
required. There is accumulating evidence that the inﬂammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is involved in the etiology of
prostate cancer. IL-6 serum levels are elevated in patients with
advanced prostate cancer (2), and levels correlate with tumor
burden and poor prognosis (3, 4). The ligand and receptor are
expressed in both premalignant and malignant prostatic tissue
(5, 6) suggesting that the pathway is constitutively active.
Accordingly, inhibition of receptor binding using an antibody
speciﬁc for the ligand-speciﬁc subunit gp80 causes regression
of prostate tumors in vivo (7, 8), showing the potential of IL-6/
IL-6 receptor interactions as a cancer therapy. IL-6 receptors

(IL-6R) are composed of an IL-6–speciﬁc receptor subunit
(gp80) and a signal transducer, gp130 (9). IL-6 uses Janusactivated kinase (JAK)-STAT as mediators of signal transduction (10), primarily STAT3 in prostate cancer (11). Constitutively activated STAT3 has been found in many types of cancer,
including leukemia, (12) squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck (HNSCC; ref. 13), multiple myeloma (14), breast (15,
16), and prostate cancer (11). Introduction of an activating
mutant of STAT3 is sufﬁcient to induce transformation of
immortalized cells (17), suggesting that the JAK-STAT signaling
pathway, through STAT3 activation, is sufﬁcient in mediating
tumorigenesis. More recent studies have suggested that STAT3
activation is important for the tumorigenic ability of cancer
stem cells in glioblastoma (18), lung (19), and colon cancer (20).
Cancer stem cells have been isolated from a wide range of
cancers including leukemia (21), breast (22), brain (23, 24), lung
(25), colon (26), pancreas (27), and prostate (28). In prostate
cancer, cells with a basal phenotype, CD44þ/a2b1hi/CD133þ
(28), CD49fhiTrop2hi (29, 30), and CD44þCD49fhiTrop2þ (31)
have many of the properties of cancer stem cells. Gene expression proﬁling of CD44þ/a2b1hi/CD133þ cancer cells, from
primary cultures, revealed signiﬁcant over-representation of
several components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (32)
providing further evidence of the role of this signaling pathway
in prostate cancer.
Current studies on the prostate have failed to account for the
heterogeneity at the cellular level as well as the differences
between patients. The aim of this study was to examine the role
of IL-6 on the fate of stem-like cells derived from patients with
prostate cancer. Here, we show that the most undifferentiated
cells in cancers express elevated levels of IL-6 and the IL-6–
speciﬁc receptor. We also show that the JAK-STAT signaling

pathway is constitutively active in the most primitive cells, and
lastly that inhibition of the pathway signiﬁcantly decreases
colony-forming ability in vitro and tumor-initiation in immunocompromised mice.

Materials and Methods
JAK-STAT inhibitors and CNTO 328
The pan-JAK inhibitor 2-tert-butyl-9-ﬂuoro-3,6-dihydro-7Hbenz[h]-imidaz[4,5-f]isoquinoline-7-one, pyridine 6 (P6) was
obtained from Calbiochem. The monoclonal antibody CNTO
328 (siltuximab) was obtained from Johnson & Johnson. CNTO
328 is a chimeric (murine-human) IgG1 monoclonal antibody
against IL-6, which blocks ligand binding. LLL12 was developed
as previously described (33). LLL12 binds directly to the
phosphoryl tyrosine 705 (pTyr705)–binding site of the STAT3
monomer.
Tissue collection, isolation, and culture of tumor cells
Human prostate tissue was obtained with patients' consent
and full ethical approval from patients undergoing radical
prostatectomy and channel transurethral resection (TURP)
for prostate cancer and from patients undergoing TURP of the
prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; Table 1). Grade
and stage of tumor were conﬁrmed by histologic examination,
by an uropathologist, of representative fragments. Epithelial
cultures were prepared and characterized as described previously (34). Cell cultures were maintained in stem cell media
(SCM) consisting of keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with (EGF, bovine pituitary extract; Invitrogen Ltd.)
2 ng/mL stem cell factor [First Link (UK) Ltd.], 100 ng/mL
cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd.), and 1 ng/mL
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF;
First Link (UK) Ltd.]. Cells were cultured in the presence of
irradiated (60 Gy) STO (mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts) cells.
After expansion, a2b1hi/CD133þ (stem-like), a2b1hi/CD133
(transit-amplifying), and a2b1low (committed basal) cells were
isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) (Miltenyi
Biotec), as described previously (35).
Generation of xenografts and isolation of tumor cells
All animal work was approved by the University of York
(York, United Kingdom) Animal Procedures and Ethics Committee and conducted under a United Kingdom Home Ofﬁce
License. Human prostatic tissue was obtained, with informed
consent, from an 83-year-old patient undergoing palliative
channel TURP for advanced prostate cancer. At diagnosis, the
tumor was graded Gleason 4þ5 and the patient was placed
on androgen-ablation therapy. At xenotransplantation, the
patient was castrate-resistant.
The fresh sample was cut into 5-mm sections, mixed with
10% Matrigel at 4 C (BD Biosciences), and immediately
implanted into the subcutaneous tissues of 2 BALB/c/
Rag2/gC/ mice. This strain was chosen as human cells
can be engrafted with high efﬁciency, as the mice are deﬁcient
in T, B, and natural killer cells (36). Mice were bred in our
facility and were housed in individually ventilated cages. Once
tumors reached 1.5 cm3, which was considered a humane
endpoint, the mice were sacriﬁced and the tumors were either

further experiments. Tumor latency was initially 93 days, but
reduced to 45 days with serial transplantation. To maintain the
tumor xenograft as "near-patient," tumors were reestablished
from frozen cells after ﬁve passages in mice.
To generate single cells from xenografts, tumors were
minced into small cubes (3 mm3) and incubated in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) and collagenase type I at 200 IU/mL (Lorne Laboratories)
for 20 hours at 37 C. Cells were washed in Dulbecco "A" PBS
(Oxoid Ltd.) and further disrupted by trituration through a 21G
blunt needle (Scientiﬁc Laboratory Supplies Ltd.). The cell
suspension was then incubated in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA for

30 minutes at 37 C, passed through a 70-mm cell strainer and a
Ficoll gradient (Ficoll-Paque Plus; GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
to further enrich for viable cells. Mouse lineageþ and endothelial cells (CD31þ) were depleted by indirectly labeling with
biotinylated anti-lineageþ antibody cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec)
and CD31 (ER-MP12; 1:20 dilution; AbD Serotec) for 10 minutes
at 4 C. Anti-biotin antibodies conjugated to Microbeads were
used as secondary labeling reagent and Lin/CD31 cells were
collected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from sorted a2b1hi/CD133þ,
a2b1hi/CD133, and a2b1low cells, derived from malignant and
nonmalignant primary cultures, using Qiagen RNease minicolumns, according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was
reverse transcribed, using random hexamers (Invitrogen) and
reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen). Real-time
PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted using TaqMan gene expression
presynthesized reagents and master mix (Applied Biosystems).
Reactions were prepared following the manufacturer's protocol. All reactions were carried out in triplicate on 96-well PCR
plates (ABI PRISM; Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRISM 7000
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Standard
thermal cycling conditions included a hot start of 5 minutes
at 50 C and 10 minutes at 95 C, followed by up to 50 cycles of
95 C for 15 seconds and 60 C for 1 minute. Data analysis was
conducted using Microsoft Excel software. Expression values
are presented relative to the endogenous control gene, RPLP0.
IL-6 ELISA
Sorted a2b1hi/CD133þ, a2b1hi/CD133, and a2b1low cells,
from malignant and nonmalignant prostate primary cultures,
were plated (in triplicate) onto 96-well collagen-coated plates
(BD-Biocoat; BD Biosciences) at a density of 1  103 cells,
together with 4  104 irradiated STO cells. Conditioned medium was collected over 48 hours and was immediately stored at
20 C. The concentrations of secreted IL-6 in the conditioned
media were measured by using the R&D Systems' Quantikine
ELISA Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, conditioned media or IL-6 standards were incubated for 2
hours at room temperature in 96-well polystyrene microplates,
coated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against IL-6. After
washing, an antibody against IL-6 conjugated to alkaline
phosphatase was added and incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature. A further wash step was conducted, substrate
and ampliﬁer was added, and the plate was read at 485 nm.
Cell-based ELISA for detection of STAT3
A cell-based ELISA was used to measure the levels of
phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) and total STAT3 simultaneously in primary prostatic cell cultures (R&D Systems),
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Brieﬂy, primary
prostate cells (1  104) were plated overnight, in triplicate,
onto a black collagen-I–coated 96-well plate, washed, and ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; w/v). Cells were subsequently
incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)- and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated

secondary antibodies. Relative ﬂuorescence units (RFU) of
phosphorylated STAT3 and total STAT3 were then measured.
Flow cytometry
Lin/CD31 tumor cells (isolated from xenografts) were
incubated with antibodies to CD44 (clone C26; BD Pharmingen) and CD24 (clone 32D12; Miltenyi Biotec), or an isotype
contol (Miltenyi Biotec), for 10 minutes at 4 C. Dead cells were
excluded using SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen).
For the detection of pSTAT3 and androgen receptor, Lin
/CD31 cells were incubated with Live/Dead stain (Invitrogen)
before labeling with cell surface CD44 and CD24 (as above).
Cells were then ﬁxed with 1.5% formaldehyde (v/v) for 5
minutes at room temperature, permeabilized with ice-cold
methanol for 10 minutes at 4 C, and ﬁnally incubated with
anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody [Tyr705 (1:10); Cell Signaling
Technology] or androgen receptor (Clone 441; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), for 30 minutes at 4 C. All cells were
analyzed on a CyAn ADP ﬂow cytometer (DakoCytomation)
and data processed using Summit v4.3 software (Beckman
Coulter Ltd.).
Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and
immunocytochemistry
Histochemistry was conducted on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded mouse xenografts. Sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and classiﬁed according to Gleason
grading (37). Immunohistochemistry was conducted on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded normal adult prostate. Antigen retrieval with citric acid (pH 6.0), at 97 C for 30 minutes,
was followed by incubation with antibodies to IL-6R (rabbit
polyclonal C-20; 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), CK5
(mouse monoclonal XM26; 1:100; Vector Laboratories Ltd.), or
an isotype control. For the detection of IL-6R, anti-rabbit
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used and anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 586 was used for the detection of CK5 (Molecular Probes;
Invitrogen). Sections were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted in Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories Ltd.) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 meta
confocal microscope.
Immunocytochemistry was conducted on sorted a2b1hi/
CD133þ, a2b1hi/CD133, and a2b1low primary cells. The cell
isolates were allowed to adhere for 2 to 3 hours, onto collagencoated slides, blocked with 10% serum and incubated with
primary antibody against IL-6R (rabbit polyclonal C-20; 1:100)
or an isotype control for 1 hour. Cells were then ﬁxed with 4%
PFA, washed twice with 50 mmol/L NH4Cl, and visualized
using anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and DAPI.
Western blot analysis for detection of phosphorylated
STAT3
Cell lysates were prepared, from primary prostate cultures,
by adding lysis buffer (CytoBuster Protein Extraction Reagent;
Novagen; Merck Chemicals Ltd.) to culture plates for 5 minutes
at room temperature. Complete protease inhibitor (EDTA-free
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet; Roche) and phosphatase
inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail; Sigma) were then
added. Equal amounts of protein were resolved on a 10% to 12%

SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were
blocked with 5% semidried milk for 1 hour and then incubated
with primary antibodies against phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705;
1:500), STAT3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), and b-actin
(1:10,000; Sigma). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 C or 1 hour at room temperature followed by
incubation with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)
immunoglobulins-HRP or goat anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulins-HRP secondary antibodies. Membranes were visualized
using BM Chemiluminescence Western Blotting Substrate
(POD; Roche) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Hyperﬁlm (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Statistical analysis
Student t test and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were
calculated using Sigma Plot. The log-rank test was used to
compare Kaplan–Meier curves. The x2 tests (to determine
tumor initiation frequencies and pairwise tests) were calculated using ELDA software (38).

Results
IL-6 expression is highest in undifferentiated, hormonena€ve, cancer cells
Primary cultures were generated from tumor tissues of 11
patients with prostate cancer at Gleason grade 6 and above
(who had not undergone treatment before biopsy; samples 1–
11; Table 1) and 7 patients who had undergone androgenablation therapy (samples 12–18; Table 1). Primary cultures
were also generated from 11 patients with the benign condition, BPH.
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the
more undifferentiated, stem-like (CD44þ/a2b1hi/CD133þ) and
transit-amplifying cells (CD44þ/a2b1hi/CD133) from tumor
biopsies expressed 7- and 6-fold higher levels of IL-6 than the
more differentiated (committed basal; CD44þ, a2b1low) cells
(Fig. 1A). Because of patient variability, this difference in IL-6
expression did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. The increase
of IL-6 expression in the stem-like and transit-amplifying
population was not observed in patients with either benign
disease or those who had undergone androgen-ablation therapy. Within the group of patient who had undergone androgen

Clonogenic recovery
Primary prostate cultures were treated with either 5 mmol/L
P6 for 16 hours, 10 mg/mL CNTO 328 for 6 days, or 1 mmol/L
LLL12 for 24 hours. CD133þ (stem-like) and CD133 (progenitor) cells were then isolated, counted, and plated on to 35-mm
collagen-coated plates (BD Biocoat; BD biosciences) at a cell
density of 100 cells per well in the presence of irradiated STO
feeders. Colonies were subsequently scored if they contained
more than 32 cells (5 population doublings) usually between 14
to 28 days after treatment.
Tumor initiation
Mouse depleted tumor cells (Lin/CD31) were treated
overnight with 0.5 to 10 mmol/L LLL12 or vehicle control. The
cells were counted and injected subcutaneously into 6- to 8week-old male Rag2/gC/ mice at limiting dilutions,
together with 2  105 irradiated STO feeder cells in Matrigel.

ablation, the levels of IL-6 increased with the differentiation of
the epithelial cells.
We then assessed the levels of IL-6 secreted from sorted cell
populations over 48 hours in culture (Fig. 1B). Similarly,
signiﬁcantly higher levels of IL-6 (P < 0.05) were secreted from
the stem-like population (from patients with cancer) compared with those with benign disease and the more differentiated cells. In contrast, cultures from patients with benign
disease secreted more IL-6 from the transit-amplifying population, compared with either stem-like cells or cell populations
committed to differentiation (P < 0.05).
These data indicate that IL-6 expression is signiﬁcantly
higher in more stem-like cells from patients with prostate
cancer, but only in those patients who had not undergone
androgen-ablation therapy, whereas secreted levels of IL-6
were signiﬁcantly higher in patients with cancer, irrespective
of treatment. These data also show that tumor grade did not
inﬂuence the levels of expression or secretion.
Stem-like cells express the IL-6R
We next looked at the expression of IL-6R (gp80) using a
combination of immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence of sorted cell populations (Fig. 2). Analysis of prostate
tissue sections showed strong expression within the luminal
cells, with weak to absent expression within the basal layer (Fig.
2). However, closer examination, at higher magniﬁcation,
revealed that rare cells within the basal layer, marked with
CK5 (a basal cell marker), coexpressed the receptor (Fig. 2A,
inset, arrows). To conﬁrm whether those rare cells were the
stem-like population, basal cells (derived from 2 patients with
BPH and 1 patient with cancer) were sorted into three populations (stem-like cells, transit-amplifying, and committed basal), and subsequently stained with antibodies to gp80 Fig. 2B).

We observed that the majority of stem-like cells expressed the
receptor, but the number of cells expressing IL-6R decreased
with differentiation of the epithelial cells. These results indicate that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway could be constitutively active (within the stem-like population) through IL-6 and
its receptor subunit (gp80).
Activation of STAT3 is mediated through IL-6
To investigate whether the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is
regulated by IL-6 in prostate cancer, we examined the relative
levels of activated STAT3 (rSTAT3-tyrosine 705). Primary
cultures were generated from 2 patients with BPH and 5
patients with prostate cancer (samples 4, 15, 19–21). Western
blot analysis results revealed that the level of activated STAT3
was variable, but pSTAT3 was present in both benign disease
and cancer (Fig. 3A). Of note, 3 of 5 cancers examined had high
levels of rSTAT3; all three had a Gleason score between 7 and 9.
We next investigated whether we could abrogate activation of
STAT3 using the chemical inhibitor P6. P6 is a speciﬁc pan-JAK
inhibitor that has been reported to act within the low nanomolar range (IC50, 1–15 nmol/L; ref. 39). Downregulation of
pSTAT3 was observed, in all primary cultures examined, and
was optimal at 5 mmol/L after 16 hours treatment (samples 17,
22, and 23; Fig. 3B). Using P6 as a positive control for pSTAT3
abrogation, we next treated primary cells [from patients with
hormone-na€ve prostate cancer (HNPC)] with a neutralizing
antibody to IL-6, CNTO 328 (siltuximab), to determine whether
pSTAT3 was similarly downregulated. Siltuximab was effective
at blocking activation of STAT3, but only after 6 days of
treatment (P < 0.05; samples 22–24; Fig. 3C). There was variability between samples, most likely due to the differing levels
of endogenous IL-6 secretion between individuals (Fig. 1).
Steiner and colleagues similarly observed downregulation of

Blockade of STAT3 activation suppresses colony-forming
ability
We next wanted to establish whether prostate stem-like cells
are dependent on JAK-STAT signaling for survival. To establish
this, we determined the potential of stem-like and progenitor
cells to initiate colonies (at clonal density) following suppression of the pathway. Cells derived from patients with Gleason
grade 7–9 prostate cancer, including those who had undergone
androgen-ablation, were treated with either 5 mmol/L P6 (for
16 hours) or 10 mg/mL CNTO 328 (for 6 days), sorted for
CD133þ/ expression and plated to determine colony-forming
efﬁciency (CFE) in the absence of drug (Fig. 4A and B). P6 was

Gleason 9 group (samples 11, 23, and 31; Fig. 4A), although this
decrease in CFE did not reach signiﬁcance. An increase in the
number of colonies was observed, with treatment, in both the
Gleason 7 group (samples 10, 25–30) and in patients who had
undergone androgen-ablation therapy (samples 16, 32–35). P6
was similarly not effective at reducing the CFE of the progenitor population in any of the groups of patients examined, and
in the majority of cases an increase in CFE was observed.
Although P6 effectively blocked activated STAT3, the functional potential of both the stem-like and progenitor cells was not
affected. In contrast, treatment of 3 patients with high Gleason
grade cancers (samples 23, 35, and 36) with CNTO 328, significantly reduced the CFE of the stem-like cells (60% reduction),
but had no effect on the number of colonies found by the
progenitor cells in 2 of 3 samples tested (Fig. 4B). Both P6 and
CNTO 328 had only a modest effect on cell viability as 78% 

16 hours with 5 mmol/L P6 (A) or 10 mg/mL CNTO 328 for 6 days (samples 23, 35, and 36; B). CD133 (stem-like) and CD133 (progenitor) cells were
subsequently isolated and plated (at clonal density) in the presence of irradiated STO feeder cells to determine CFE. Colonies were scored if they had
undergone ﬁve or more population doublings (32 cells), approximately 14 days after plating. The results are expressed as relative to the CFE of the nontreated
cells (1%). Each circle represents an individual patient and the bar is the average of each group. C, Western blot analysis of a representative primary culture
(sample 37) treated overnight with increasing concentrations of LLL12. D, relative CFE following treatment of stem-like and progenitor cells with 1 mmol/L

therapy (samples 23, 33, 35, and 36). Statistical analyses was conducted using the Student t test;  , P < 0.05.

15.9% of cells were viable after 16 hours in the presence of P6
and 91%  9.5% of cells were viable in the presence of CNTO
328 (results not shown). These results show that IL-6 is
required for survival of stem-like cells in prostate cancer, but
that the JAK-STAT pathway may not be involved as P6 had little
effect on reducing colony-forming activity. To address this, we
treated cells with a novel pSTAT3 inhibitor, LLL12, which binds
speciﬁcally to the phosphoryl tyrosine 705 (pTyr705)–binding
site of the STAT3 monomer (41). Treatment with LLL12
prevented phosphorylation of STAT3 at a concentration of 1
mmol/L. P6 was used as a positive control and similarly
suppressed pSTAT3 (sample 37; Fig. 4C). We then determined
the functional effect of suppressing pSTAT3 following treatment with LLL12. Primary cultures from high Gleason grade
cancers (samples 23, 33, 35, and 36) were treated with 1 mmol/L
LLL12 for 24 hours. We observed that, unlike CNT0328 and P6,
LLL12 treatment signiﬁcantly affected cell viability. The num-

5294

ber of cells remaining after treatment was approximately 40%
 26% (results not shown). The viable cells were then plated to
determine whether CFE was similarly affected. Unlike treatment with P6, we found a signiﬁcant and marked reduction in
the number of colonies in all patients tested (n ¼ 4) and in both
populations (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that targeting constitutive STAT3 in prostate cancer maybe an attractive therapeutic option.
STAT3 blockade abolishes tumor initiation
To provide further preclinical evidence, a murine xenograft
model was used to determine the in vivo effects of pSTAT3
suppression. This xenograft was recently derived, in our laboratory, from a castrate-resistant patient (Supplementary Fig.
S1). pSTAT3 status was determined (by ﬂow cytometry) on
dissociated tumor cells [depleted of mouse lineageþ hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Lin/CD31)]. The majority of

treatment with either 0.5 or 1 mmol/L LLL12, showed that
treatment induced differentiation to a more luminal phenotype
as the majority of cells expressed CD24. Interestingly, only 1% of
the cancer cells expressed pSTAT3 following treatment with
both 0.5 and 1 mmol/L LLL12 (Fig. 5D; indicated in red).
These results show that LLL12 is potent at suppressing
tumor initiation of human prostate cancer cells in vivo.

cells expressed activated STAT3 (Fig. 5A) and were subsequently treated for 12 hours with 0.5 to 10 mmol/L LLL12. LLL12
caused marked cell death, with approximately 15% of cells
viable following treatment (results not shown). Equal numbers
of viable cells were then injected subcutaneously at limiting
dilutions to determine tumor frequency (Table 2). Strikingly,
LLL12 treatment (at 10 and 5 mmol/L) effectively abolished
tumor initiation. At these concentrations, pSTAT3 is effectively
blocked (Fig. 5B). Tumors were only observed from the dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)-control group at a frequency of 1:161 and
from ex vivo treatment with 0.5 and 1 mmol/L LLL12, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 5C). Pairwise tests, to determine if there
were differences in tumor frequencies with treatment, determined that 1 mmol/L LLL12, but not 0.5 mmol/L LLL12, significantly reduced the ability to initiate tumors (P ¼ 0.016; Table 3).
At this concentration, it is unlikely that pSTAT3 is sufﬁciently
blocked (Fig. 5B). Characterization of tumors, from ex vivo

Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that STAT3 activation is
required for the survival of stem-like cells in prostate cancer,
and that stem-like and progenitor cells, from human patients
with prostate cancer, have constitutively activated STAT3.
Blockade of activated STAT3 by either anti-IL-6–blocking
activity, or direct inhibition, signiﬁcantly suppresses clonogenic ability in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Our results

show that blockade of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway represents an important therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.
Activation of STAT3 has been shown to occur through
binding of the IL-6 family of cytokines to the gp130 receptor
in leukemia (12), HNSCC (13), multiple myeloma (14), breast
(15, 16), and prostate cancer (11). Furthermore, high circulating levels of IL-6 have been found in patients with advanced
cancer, including prostate cancer (2–4). More recently, a
microarray gene expression analysis of selected cell populations (including stem-like cells from prostate cancer biopsies)
found over-representation of several components of the JAKSTAT signaling cascade, including IL-6 (32). The results of this
study support those ﬁndings, as the highest levels of IL-6 were
observed in cancer stem-like and progenitor cells. We also
found that IL-6 levels did not correlate with tumor grade or
disease progression, in contrast to reports that IL-6 levels are
signiﬁcantly greater in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer than in those with hormone-sensitive disease
(6, 42). It is proposed that this increase is due to the abolished
suppression of IL-6 expression by androgens (43). As immune
cells are likely to make a signiﬁcant contribution to circulating
IL-6 levels, it is impossible to compare this ﬁnding with those in
our model. Moreover, primary cultures are mostly composed of
basal-like cells that do not express active androgen receptor,
and will therefore be most likely indirectly inﬂuenced by
androgens (28).
Our results indicate that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is
constitutively active in the stem-like population in prostate
cancer as IL-6 and the gp80 receptor were both expressed. This
was conﬁrmed by detection of activated STAT3, in all samples
analyzed. We also established that signaling is mediated
through IL-6 in prostate as a blocking antibody against IL-6
(CNTO 328) abolished STAT3 activation. The consequences of
STAT3 blockade included the suppression of colony-forming
ability, suggesting that cancer stem-like and progenitor cells
require pSTAT3 for survival. We found that the small-molecule
inhibitor, LLL12, was more potent at suppressing colony
formation, than either P6 or CNTO 328. Despite blockade of
activated STAT3, P6 was relatively ineffective at suppressing
colony-forming activity. Indeed, we observed an expansion in
colony numbers (in the majority of patients treated with P6).
Although LLL12 treatment signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability,
we found that P6 had little effect on viability. Pedranzini and
colleagues showed that P6 was only effective at reducing cell
proliferation of myeloma cell lines after 3 days treatment (44).
Although we observed a similarly modest reduction in cell
viability with CNTO 328 treatment, colony recovery of the
stem-like cells was signiﬁcantly reduced, suggesting that this
population is more dependent on IL-6 for survival. However,

5296

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

direct blockade of pSTAT3, with LLL12, effectively suppressed
colony formation of both stem and progenitor populations (in
patients with high-grade cancer and advanced disease). Our
data are supported by others in glioma and colon cancer, who
propose that STAT3 is a survival factor for cancer stem-like
cells (20, 45). Although the effect with LLL12 was consistent, a
larger study should be undertaken to conﬁrm our results.
Siltuximab (CNTO 328) had little effect on survival in recent
phase II trials for chemotherapy-treated patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (46, 47). A dramatic increase in
plasma IL-6 was observed following treatment with siltuximab
(46) although C-reactive protein (a marker of systemic inﬂammation) declined after treatment. It is possible that the
observed increase in plasma IL-6 was due to a feedback loop
in which blockade of pSTAT3 resulted in a concomitant
increase in IL-6 levels. Unfortunately, this did not result in
increased survival, suggesting that either pSTAT3 is not
required for survival or that there is heterogeneity in expression (of rSTAT3, IL-6, or IL-6R) between patients and the
different populations of cancer cells, as shown in our study and
by others (5).
Finally, a murine xenograft model was used to determine
the in vivo effects of pSTAT3 suppression. The xenograft tumor
was derived from a patient with castrate-resistant disease and
was chosen for this study as LLL12 was effective at reducing
colonies from high-grade, advanced tumors, and we observed
that the majority of cells expressed activated STAT3. Our
results conﬁrm the in vitro data, as tumor initiation was
abolished at concentrations of LLL12 that effectively blocked
activated STAT3 and supports ﬁndings that STAT3 is a survival
factor in a number of solid tumors. These data also show that
the phenotype of the tumor-initiating cell is reminiscent of an
intermediate cell as both CD44 and androgen receptor is
expressed. Further work has to be undertaken on sorted cell
populations to conﬁrm this. We also found that tumors
generated following ex vivo treatment with either 0.5 or 1
mmol/L LLL12 were largely differentiated as the majority of
cells expressed CD24 and lacked expression of pSTAT3. We
propose that those tumors would not effectively serially transplant and would be more amenable to combination therapy.
In conclusion, we propose that targeting the JAK-STAT
pathway is worthy of consideration for advanced prostate
cancer. Despite the disappointing results with siltuximab, the
evidence from this study and others supports further investigation. It is vital, however, when designing clinical trials that
patients are stratiﬁed for their likely response to STAT3
blockade.
