ABSTRACT
Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) is the second most common bone cancer in children and
young people. Edelfosine (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine)
is the prototype of a family of synthetic antitumor compounds, collectively known as
alkylphospholipid analogs (APLs). We have found that APLs ranked edelfosine>pe
rifosine>erucylphosphocholine>miltefosine for their capacity to promote apoptosis
in ES cells. Edelfosine accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and triggered
an ER stress response that eventually led to caspase-dependent apoptosis in ES
cells. This apoptotic response involved mitochondrial-mediated processes, with
cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation and generation of reactive oxygen species.
Edelfosine-induced apoptosis was also dependent on sustained c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase activation. Oral administration of edelfosine showed a potent in vivo antitumor
activity in an ES xenograft animal model. Histochemical staining gave evidence for
ER stress response and apoptosis in the ES tumors isolated from edelfosine-treated
mice. Edelfosine showed a preferential action on ES tumor cells as compared to nontransformed osteoblasts, and appeared to be well suited for combination therapy
regimens. These results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of
edelfosine against ES cells that is mediated by caspase activation and ER stress,
and provide the proof of concept for a putative edelfosine- and ER stress-mediated
approach for ES treatment.

INTRODUCTION

ES is a member of Ewing’s family tumors (ESFT)
and it is associated in 85-90% of cases with the t(11;22)
(q24:q12) chromosomal translocation that generates
fusion of the 5’ segment of the EWS gene with the 3’
segment of the ETS family gene FLI-1. The resulting
EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein alters transcriptional activity
and modulates the expression of a number of downstream
target genes relevant to apoptosis, proliferation, and neural
differentiation, leading to aberrant transcription that
promotes tumor initiation and propagation via prosurvival
and antiapoptotic pathways [2, 5].
ES has a high metastatic proclivity and is typically
refractory to conventional chemo- and radiation therapy.

Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) is the third most frequent
primary bone cancer, and the second most common,
after osteosarcoma, in children, adolescents, and young
adults. ES tumors primarily affect children and teenagers,
represent almost 3% of pediatric cancers with a peak
incidence between the ages of 10 and 15, and are rarely
seen in children younger than 5 or adults older than 30
[1-3]. ES is considered a rare disease with an estimated
annual incidence of 0.6-2.9 per million population, and
the natural course of the disease is rapid dissemination and
death from metastases within 1-2 years from diagnosis [4].

RESULTS

The prognosis of children and young adults with metastatic
or recurrent disease is poor, with less than one-third of
patients with metastases at diagnosis and only 10% of
patients with recurrent disease being long-term survivors
[6, 7]. The presence of cancer stem cells in ES might be, at
least in part, responsible for refractory responses to current
chemotherapies as well as for the aggressive behavior and
high tendency to early metastasis and relapse of the disease
[8, 9]. With modern multimodal regimens consisting of
local surgery and/or radiotherapy plus intensive systemic
chemotherapy, survival can be achieved for ~70% of
patients with localized disease, but a relapse of ~30%
leads to unfavorable prognosis [10]. However, despite
advances in diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment, the
5-year survival of ES patients with metastatic or recurrent
disease remains less than 25% [10, 11], with patients
with isolated lung metastases having better prognosis
(30% at 5 years) than those with bone or bone marrow
metastases (≤20% at 5 years) [4]. Thus, search for new
chemotherapeutic agents are urgently needed to improve
clinical outcome. Microarray, miRNA and functional
studies suggest that ES tumors with poor prognosis show
resistance to apoptosis [12-16], which might constitute
one of the major mechanisms in tumor progression and
chemoresistance. On these grounds, triggering of the
cancer cell apoptotic machinery constitutes an appealing
approach to combat ES [17].
The alkylphospholipid analogs (APLs) represent
a number of structurally related compounds that show
antitumor activity against several tumor cells by affecting
signaling processes at the membrane level [18-21]. Among
the distinct APLs, miltefosine is already in clinical use
as a topical cytostatic drug for palliative treatment of
cutaneous metastases from breast cancer [22, 23], and
orally administered perifosine is in clinical trials for
the treatment of distinct tumors [23, 24]. The ether
phospholipid edelfosine (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methoxyrac-glycero-3-phosphocholine), considered as the APL
prototype, is a rather selective antitumor drug [25-27]
that preferentially accumulates in tumor cells [25, 26,
28, 29], and promotes apoptosis in a wide number of
both hematological and solid tumor-derived cancer cells
through lipid raft reorganization, leading to the activation
of the death receptor Fas/CD95 independently of its
natural ligand FasL/CD95L [26-28, 30-34], or by eliciting
an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response [34-36].
Because edelfosine is a potent inducer of apoptosis in
cancer cells, we analyzed whether this proapoptotic ether
lipid drug could be a promising active drug in the search
of drugs targeting apoptosis in this pediatric cancer. Thus,
we investigated the in vitro and in vivo action of this drug
on ES cells as well as its underlying mechanism of action.
In this work, we show both in vitro and in vivo evidence
for the anti-ES activity of edelfosine, promoting apoptosis
through the accumulation of edelfosine in the ER, leading
to an ER stress response.

Edelfosine is the most active APL in promoting
apoptosis in ES cells
Previous in vivo and tissue distribution assays
conducted in mice have shown that the pharmacologically
effective concentration of edelfosine in plasma is in
the 10-20 μM range [28, 29, 37]. Thus, we analyzed a
time-course analysis of the ability of the most clinically
relevant APLs (edelfosine, perifosine, miltefosine and
erucylphosphocholine) to induce apoptosis in human
CADO-ES1 and RD-ES Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines
when used at 10 μM. We found that edelfosine was the
most active APL in eliciting an apoptotic response in
both CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cells in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1A and 1B). Edelfosine was the only
APL that induced a potent apoptotic response after 24 h,
while the other APLs required longer incubation times
(Figure 1B). APLs ranked edelfosine > perifosine >
erucylphosphocholine > miltefosine for their capacity to
promote apoptosis in ES cells (Figure 1B). We also found
that the structurally related inactive edelfosine analog
1-O-octadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18OH) [25, 38], in which the methoxy group in the sn-2
position of the edelfosine molecule was replaced by an
OH group, was unable to trigger apoptosis in both ES cell
lines (Figure 1C and 1D), indicating that the proapoptotic
activity of edelfosine was highly dependent on its specific
chemical structure. Because edelfosine was the most active
APL against ES cells, we further analyzed the underlying
mechanism of action for the anti-ES activity of edelfosine.
We also found that edelfosine induced a very
weak autophagic response in ES cells, as assessed
by the small rate of conversion of LC3 from the
unconjugated form (LC3-I), which is in the cytosol, to
the phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3II) that binds to the autophagosomal membrane, as well
as by the negligible effect on the BECN1 protein level
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Inhibition either at the early
or late stages of autophagy by using wortmannin and
chloroquine, respectively, hardly affected the edelfosineinduced apoptotic response, with only a small, statistically
nonsignificant increase in apoptosis in both CADO-ES1
and RD-ES cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). These
data suggest that edelfosine mainly induces a potent
apoptotic response in ES cells with only a minor induction
of autophagy that had no consequences in the cell death
response.

ES cancer cells are more sensitive to edelfosine
than non-transformed human osteoblasts

1.19 cells as compared to CADO-ES1 ES cells (Figure 2),
thus indicating that ES tumor cells were more sensitive
to edelfosine proapoptotic action than non-transformed
osteoblasts. Interestingly, CADO-ES1 cancer cells seem
to be especially sensitive to edelfosine, and very low
concentrations of edelfosine (2.5-5 µM) were sufficient to
trigger apoptosis (Figure 2).

We next analyzed the proapoptotic activity of
edelfosine on human hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts, which have
been widely used as a model of normal osteoblasts. The
hFOB 1.19 cell line was established by stable transfection
of fetal bone-derived osteoblast cells with a temperaturesensitive mutant of the SV40 T antigen [39]. hFOB
1.19 cells exhibit the matrix synthetic properties of
differentiated osteoblasts, and are immortalized but nontransformed human osteoblasts. This cell line is considered
to be an excellent model for the study of normal osteoblast
biology in vitro [40]. We found that higher concentrations
of edelfosine were required to induce apoptosis in hFOB

apoptotic cells, whereas the cell cycle phases S and G2/M
were not significantly affected (Figures 3A and 3B). The
apoptotic response induced by edelfosine was detected
after only 9-15 h incubation in both ES cell lines (Figure
3B). This apoptotic response, detected by the appearance
of a sub-G1 population in cell cycle analysis, which is

indicative of DNA degradation, was further supported
by the internucleosomal DNA degradation detected after
9 h incubation with 10 µM edelfosine (Figure 3C). In
addition, we found that edelfosine induced caspase-3 and
-7 activation, as assessed by cleavage of procaspase-3
and -7 into their respective p20 active forms, as well as
by proteolysis of the caspase-3 and -7 substrate 116 kDa-

Mitochondrial involvement in edelfosine-induced
apoptosis in ES cells

poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) into the 85-kDa
cleaved form of PARP in CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cells
(Figure 3D). This caspase activation was detected at early
incubation times in both ES cell lines, namely about 6 h
incubation as assessed by Western blot (Figure 3D) and
about 3 h incubation as estimated by colorimetric assays
(Figure 3E). The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk as
well as the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO drastically
inhibited the apoptotic death of ES cells induced by
edelfosine (Figure 3F).

Following ER stress response induced by edelfosine,
we found Bap31 cleavage, leading to the generation of
the 20-kDa fragment (Figure 4B) that acts as a signal
transmitter between ER and mitochondria [44, 47].
On these grounds, we examined the putative role of
mitochondria in the killing action of edelfosine on ES
cells. Caspase-9 was activated by the time apoptosis
was triggered, as assessed by Western blot (Figure 5A),
showing the cleavage of 47 kDa-procaspase-9 into
the active 35-38-kDa fragment, and by colorimetric
measurements (Figure 5B). Preincubation with the
caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk prevented edelfosineinduced apoptosis (Figure 5C). Edelfosine treatment
resulted in a rapid activation of the proapoptotic
protein Bax, detected by using an anti-Bax (clone 6A7)
monoclonal antibody that recognized the active form of
Bax (Figure 5A). However, the levels of the antiapoptotic
proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were hardly affected (Figure
5A). We also found a rapid release of cytochrome c
from the mitochondria into the cytosol (Figure 5A).
Edelfosine induced the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) as well as mitochondrial transmembrane
potential (ΔΨm) dissipation, as assessed by the conversion
of dihydroethidium (DHE) into ethidium (Eth) (red
fluorescence) and the loss of 3,3´-dihexyloxacarbocyanine
iodide [DiOC6(3)] fluorescence (green fluorescence),
respectively, in both CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cells
(Figure 5D). The generation of ROS was rather prominent
following incubation of ES cells with edelfosine (Figure
5D and 5E), and pretreatment of ES cells with the
antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) inhibited
edelfosine-induced apoptosis (Figure 5F), suggesting a
role for ROS generation in the killing process.

Edelfosine accumulates in the ER and induces ER
stress in ES cells
Next, we analyzed the intracellular location of
edelfosine in ES cells. To this aim, we used the fluorescent
edelfosine analog 1-O-[11’-(6’’-ethyl-1’’,3’’,5’’,7’’tetramethyl-4’’,4’’-difluoro-4’’-bora-3a’’,4a’’-diazas-indacen-2’’-yl)undecyl]-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3phosphocholine (Et-BDP-ET) that has been previously
reported to be a reliable analog to visualize the subcellular
localization of the drug [35, 41, 42]. Et-BDP-ET was
predominately located in the ER of CADO-ES1 cells
(Figure 4A), as assessed by using a version of red
fluorescence protein targeted to the ER lumen (ERtargeted red fluorescence protein), which completely
colocalized with the ER marker calreticulin [43]. We also
found that edelfosine induced an ER stress response in
both CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cell lines, as assessed by
a number of ER stress markers (Figure 4B), including
caspase-4 activation (cleavage of procaspase-4 into its
p20 active form), CHOP/GADD153 upregulation, eIF2α
phosphorylation, and cleavage of Bap31 into the 20-kDa
fragment that acts as a linker of proapoptotic signals
between ER and mitochondria [44]. Phosphorylation of
eIF2α was detected after only 3-h incubation (Figure 4B),
suggesting that edelfosine elicits rapidly an ER stress
response. However, the protein level of GRP78, a major
ER chaperone that promotes tumor cell survival [45], was
not affected following edelfosine treatment (Figure 4B).
Preincubation with the caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk
prevented edelfosine-induced apoptosis (Figure 4C and
4D). Because ER is a key subcellular structure for Ca2+
storage and for the control of intracellular free Ca2+ levels,
we examined the effect of edelfosine on intracellular
Ca2+ levels in ES cells by using the intracellular free Ca2+
indicator Fluo-4 [46]. Edelfosine treatment increased
the intracellular free Ca2+ level as detected by confocal
microscopy and flow cytometry (Figure 4E and 4F).
Intracellular Ca2+ chelation with BAPTA (1,2-bis(2aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid) led
to a modest, but statistically significant, reduction of
the edelfosine-induced apoptotic response (Figure 4G).
Taken together, these data suggest that edelfosine induces
apoptosis through an ER stress response in ES cells.

Involvement of c-Jun amino terminal kinase
(JNK), but not extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase (ERK), in edelfosine-induced apoptosis in
ES cells
ASK-1/JNK signaling has been implicated in ERinduced apoptosis [48]. Here, we found that edelfosine
induced a potent and persistent activation of JNK in both
CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cells, as assessed by a solidphase kinase assay, using a fusion protein between GST
and c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) as a substrate of JNK, as
well as by Western blot for JNK phosphorylation (Figure
6A, upper). Using both techniques we found a very rapid
activation of JNK after 3 h incubation, thus suggesting that
this response was an early event following treatment of ES
cells with edelfosine. Preincubation with the specific JNK
inhibitor SP600125 highly reduced the edelfosine-induced
apoptotic response in both CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cells

(Figure 6A, lower). Edelfosine treatment also induced
ERK phosphorylation in both ES cell lines (Figure 6B,

did not significantly affect the apoptotic response induced
by edelfosine (Figure 6B, lower), even though U0126 by
itself promoted a slight increase in apoptosis, particularly
in CADO-ES1 cells (Figure 6B, lower).

tumor xenografts. Light microscopic and immunohistochemical examination (x200 magnification) of xenograft tumors were performed
in tumor-bearing drug-free SCID mice (Control) and animals treated with 30 mg/kg edelfosine (EDLF). Tissue sections of tumors were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), showing the presence of irregular and medium-sized giant cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm
and pyknotic nuclei (arrow), indicative of cell death by apoptosis, following edelfosine treatment. Proliferative cells were observed in
tumor tissue from drug-free animals following Ki67 staining, whereas the tumor sections of edelfosine-treated animals showed lack of
staining. Treatment of CADO-ES1 tumor-bearing mice with edelfosine resulted in increased tumor apoptosis as detected by activated
caspase-3 staining. Cleaved caspase-3-positive cells (arrow) were observed in edelfosine-treated mice tumors, while no staining was
detected in drug-free animals. Positive staining for GADD153 is shown as dark coloring of the cell nucleus (arrow) in the edelfosine-treated
tumor. Images shown are representative of at least four independent experiments.

treatment for this pediatric cancer. Interestingly, we
have also found that the combination of metformin and
edelfosine also potentiates apoptosis in CADO-ES1 cells
(Figure 8). Metformin is the most commonly prescribed
drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus, but it is now emerging as
an attractive candidate for cancer prevention and treatment
[55].

In vivo identification of apoptosis and ER stress
in ES tumors following edelfosine oral treatment
Histological patterns of tumors isolated from
control drug-free tumor-bearing animals revealed a
relative uniformity in cell size and morphology, including
the nuclear morphology. In contrast, examination of
hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of tumors from
mice orally treated with edelfosine showed the presence
of irregular, large and medium-sized giant cells with
eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei (Figure 7D).
The nuclei in dying cells displayed nuclear fragmentation
characteristic of cell death by apoptosis (Figure 7D). A
strong cell proliferation activity, as assessed by Ki67
staining, was determined in the tumors isolated from
the control drug-free group (Figure 7D), but no cell
proliferation was detected in the tumor xenografts from
the edelfosine-treated group (Figure 7D). The antiactivated caspase-3-specific antibody selectively labeled
the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells in tumors from drugtreated mice, while no staining was observed in the
control drug-free group (Figure 7D). Upregulation of the
ER stress-associated marker CHOP/GADD153, indicating
an ER stress response, was visualized in the ES tumors
isolated from edelfosine-treated mice, but not from control
drug-free mice (Figure 7D). These results indicate that
edelfosine treatment induces ER stress and apoptosis in
the ES tumors in vivo.

DISCUSSION
The results reported here show for the first time the
antitumor activity of the ether phospholipid edelfosine
against ES cells, and point out the involvement of ER
as a target in ES therapy. Edelfosine induces caspasedependent apoptotic cell demise in ES cells that is mainly
mediated by targeting ER and involves ER stress and
mitochondrial-mediated processes. Our data indicate that
edelfosine is the most potent APL in eliciting an apoptotic
response in ES cells. Among the most clinically relevant
APLs, we found that these compounds ranked edelfosine
> perifosine > erucylphosphocholine > miltefosine for
their capacity to promote apoptosis in ES cells. Edelfosine
induced a remarkable apoptotic activity in ES cells when
used at the low micromolar range (5-10 µM), which fits
well with the steady-state plasma levels of edelfosine (1020 µM) found in a number of animal model in vivo assays
[28, 29, 37]. In addition, ES cancer cells seem to be rather
sensitive to edelfosine, as apoptosis was triggered upon
incubation with very low concentrations of edelfosine
(2.5-5 µM). The fact that ES tumor cells were more
sensitive to edelfosine than the non-transformed hFOB
1.19 osteoblast cell line is in agreement with previous
reports showing a rather selective proapoptotic action of
edelfosine on tumor cells [25-27].
Figure 9 depicts a schematic model of a putative
mechanism of action for edelfosine-induced apoptosis
in ES cells. Edelfosine accumulates in the ER where it
triggers an ER stress response, leading to caspase-4
activation, CHOP/GADD153 upregulation, eIF2α
phosphorylation, increase in intracellular free Ca2+ level,
and cleavage of Bap31 into the 20-kDa fragment, which
directs proapoptotic signals between ER and mitochondria
[44]. Mitochondria seem to be critical in the apoptotic
outcome in edelfosine-treated ES cells, leading to Bax
and caspase-9 activation, ΔΨm dissipation, release of
cytochrome c to the cytosol, and ROS generation.
Caspase-9 could be activated by either ER-related
caspase-4 activation [56] or apoptosome formation
through the binding of cytochrome c to apoptosis proteaseactivating factor-1 [57]. Inhibition of caspase-4, caspase-9
and ROS generation blocked edelfosine-induced apoptosis,
highlighting the essential role of ER and mitochondria in
edelfosine-induced apoptosis in ES cells. The generation
of ROS is suggested to lead to the acquisition of apoptosispromoting conditions, thus facilitating the triggering of
an apoptotic response. Increased intracellular free Ca2+

Combination of edelfosine with drugs in clinical
use for ES potentiates apoptosis
We next analyzed the putative potentiation of
apoptosis as a result of combining edelfosine with
additional drugs used in the clinics for ES treatment and
acting through different mechanisms of action. Current
standard chemotherapy includes vincristine, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide, also known as VDC, alternating
with ifosfamide and etoposide [49, 50]. As shown in
Figure 8, we found that the combination of edelfosine with
vincristine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide potentiated
the proaptototic effect of edelfosine in CADO-ES1
cancer cells. Vincristine as well as other microtubuledamaging agents suppress microtubule dynamics, leading
to disruption of the mitotic spindle in dividing cells, cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis [51, 52], whereas doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide act through DNA interaction [53,
54]. Because edelfosine does not target DNA, but acts at
the cell membrane level [18, 33, 34], this drug is a good
candidate for the combination with the above antitumor
drugs in order to improve therapeutic regimens for the

level seems to play a role, but likely not an essential
one, in edelfosine-induced cell demise, as Ca2+ chelation
inhibits, but does not totally block, apoptosis. JNK was
persistently activated during incubation of ES cells with
edelfosine, and JNK inhibition prevented edelfosineinduced apoptosis, suggesting a major role for JNK in the
proapoptotic action of edelfosine on ES cells, in a similar
way as previously found for the proapoptotic action of
edelfosine in leukemic [38] and pancreatic [35] cancer
cells. Thus, JNK seems to be a critical signaling pathway
in the proapoptotic action of edelfosine in cancer cells.
	 The results reported here represent the first
study on the action of APLs in ES and demonstrate
the potent proapoptotic in vitro and in vivo anti-ES
activity of edelfosine. In addition, the upregulation of
CHOP/GADD153 in the xenograft tumors that undergo
apoptosis following edelfosine oral treatment of ES
tumor-bearing mice further supports the in vivo ER stress
response induced by edelfosine in this tumor. Perifosine
has been recently found to induce apoptosis in human
osteosarcoma cells [58]. A phase II study of daily oral
perifosine in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma
showed prolonged responses in heavily pretreated patients,
even though the primary objective of ≥40% 6-month
progression-free survival rate was not achieved, with

grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity or fatigue being the
most common ( > 50% of patients) toxicities observed
[59]. In contrast, another phase II study involving adult
patients with locally advanced or metastatic inoperable
soft tissue sarcoma did not show evidence of activity
[60]. Our data suggest that edelfosine shows a higher
anti-ES activity than perifosine, and previous animal
model studies have shown the lack of significant toxicity
following orally administered edelfosine [28, 29, 61],
including lack of cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity or renal
toxicity [61]. Our present study on the in vitro and in vivo
actions of edelfosine on ES, together with the effective in
vivo antitumor action of this APL on several additional
tumors, such as pancreatic cancer [35], multiple myeloma
[28], mantle lymphoma [29] and chronic lymphoblastic
lymphoma [29], warrants further studies on the putative
use of edelfosine as a promising antitumor drug lacking
significant toxicity.
Interestingly, the herein reported potentiation
of proapoptotic activity following combination of
edelfosine with several anticancer drugs currently used
for ES treatment suggests that edelfosine could be a
promising candidate for the use of combination therapy
in this disease. The results reported here suggest that
the combined use of edelfosine, acting at the membrane

level, with drugs targeting microtubules (vincristine) or
DNA (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) might improve
the current therapeutic regimens for ES. Furthermore, we
also found here that the combined treatment of metformin
and edelfosine also potentiated apoptosis in ES cells.
Metformin, a well-known insulin-sensitizer commonly
used for type 2 diabetes therapy that is gaining attention
in cancer research [62-64], has recently been found to
inhibit growth and sensitize osteosarcoma cell lines to
cisplatin [65]. In addition, metformin has been recently
found to potentiate the efficacy of antitumor drugs against
different tumor cells [66-70]. Our results have shown that
the combined treatment of edelfosine and the above drugs
noticeably potentiated the apoptosis outcome elicited
by each individual drug in ES cells, thus suggesting
that edelfosine, as well as its underlying endoplasmic
reticulum-mediated mechanism of action, might be of
interest for combination therapy regimens in the treatment
of this pediatric cancer.
Despite multimodal therapy, consisting of highdose chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy, survival of
patients with metastatic or recurrent ES has not improved
significantly during the past decades. The results reported
here provide the proof of concept for the anti-ES efficacy
of edelfosine, and suggest that edelfosine oral treatment
can become a promising new drug for ES therapy. On
these grounds, further studies focused on effectively
translating the herein reported therapeutic benefits in a
putative clinical setting are warranted. In addition, the
fact that edelfosine targets ER in ES cells (this report)
as well as in pancreatic cancer cells [35], leading to ER
stress-mediated apoptosis, highlights that ER can be a
promising and valuable target for the design of therapeutic
strategies and drugs aimed to improve cancer treatment,
and particularly ES prognosis.

Cells and culture conditions
The human ES cell lines CADO-ES1 and RD-ES
were from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen
und Zellkulturen GmbH-DSMZ (German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), and were grown
in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heatinactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37ºC in humidified 95%
air and 5% CO2. APLs were added to the cell culture
at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the
respective figures. To analyze the effect of the distinct
caspase and kinase inhibitors used in this study, 2.5 x 105/
ml cells were pretreated with each inhibitor for 1 h before
edelfosine treatment, and then samples were analyzed by
flow cytometry to determine apoptosis through cell cycle
analyses.

Measurement of caspase activity by colorimetric
methods
Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were quantified
by spectrophotometric detection of chromophore
(pNA, p-nitroanilide) following its cleavage from the
labeled substrates Ac-DEVD-pNA and Ac-LEHD-pNA
(Calbiochem), respectively. ES cell lines were treated with
10 µM edelfosine during different time periods. Then cells
were lysed with extract buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.7,
0.3 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton
X-100, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4),
containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml
aprotinin and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and supplemented with
2 mM DTT. For the quantification of caspase activity, 25
and 50 μg protein were used for evaluation of caspase-3
and caspase 9 activities respectively in 96-well plates.
Next, extracts were incubated with 100 µM of substrate
in the reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10%
sucrose, 10 mM DTT) for 1 h at 37°C. All reactions
were performed in triplicate. The samples were read by
an ELISA spectrophotometer (BioRad) at 405 nm. The
results are expressed as relative caspase activity, which
is the ratio between the caspase activity of the sample and
that measured in control (without treatment).
