EGFR Nuclear Translocation Modulates DNA Repair
following Cisplatin and Ionizing Radiation Treatment
Gianmaria Liccardi, John A. Hartley, and Daniel Hochhauser

Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. It modulates DNA repair after radiation-induced damage through association with the catalytic
subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). We investigated the role of EGFR nuclear import and its association
with DNA-PKcs on DNA repair after exposure to cisplatin or ionizing radiation (IR). The model system was based on
EGFR-null murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts in which EGFR expression was restored with isoforms that were wild-type
(wt), derived from human cancers (L858R, EGFRvIII), or mutated in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence.
In cells expressing wtEGFR or EGFRvIII, there was complete unhooking of cisplatin-induced interstrand cross-links
and repair of IR-induced strand breaks. In contrast, cells expressing L858R or NLS mutations showed reduced
unhooking of interstrand cross-links and repair of strand breaks. Immunoprecipitation showed wtEGFR and
EGFRvIII binding to DNA-PKcs, increasing 2-fold 18 hours after cisplatin therapy. Confocal microscopy and
proximity ligation assay showed that this interaction in the cytoplasm and nucleus was associated with increased
DNA protein kinase complex (DNA-PK) activity. Cells expressing the EGFR L858R mutation, which has constitutive
kinase activity, exhibited reduced DNA repair without nuclear localization. EGFR-NLS mutants showed impaired
nuclear localization and DNA-PKcs association with reduced DNA repair and DNA-PK kinase activity. In summary,
EGFR nuclear localization was required for modulation of cisplatin and IR-induced repair of DNA damage. EGFR–
DNA-PKcs binding was induced by cisplatin or IR but not by EGFR nuclear translocation per se. Our findings show
that EGFR subcellular distribution can modulate DNA repair kinetics, with implications for design of EGFR-targeted
combinational therapies. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1103–14. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promotes the
activation of survival signaling pathways including RAS/
MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase), PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT, and JAK (Janus activated kinase)/
STAT (1, 2). Increased EGFR activation and overexpression
is strongly associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression (3). EGFR is an important target for cancer therapies
including antibodies disrupting ligand–receptor interactions
such as cetuximab (4, 5) and small molecules inhibiting EGFR
kinase activity including gefitinib (6, 7) and erlotinib (8). There
has been extensive investigation on the mechanisms by which
EGFR inhibition modulates the activity of chemotherapy and

radiation (3). Combinations of the monoclonal antibody
(mAb) cetuximab with cisplatin or radiation have been useful
clinically in the treatment of head and neck and colon cancer
(9, 10). In contrast, despite effects in vitro (11), only small
benefits have been obtained combining small molecules inhibiting EGFR with conventional treatment. Several studies have
shown the association of EGFR with the catalytic subunit of
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), a central component of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway
involved in the repair of DNA strand breaks (12, 13).
Recently, it has been reported that a fraction of intracellular
EGFR is located within the nucleus where it may activate
transcription of genes, including cyclin D1, iNOS, c-myb, and
COX-2, that are associated with cell proliferation and the nitric
oxide pathway (14–17). Evidence for the expression and
activity of nuclear EGFR has been found using a variety of
techniques including fractional immunoblotting, confocal
microscopy, electron microscopy, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Nuclear EGFR has been shown to
correlate with worse prognosis in a variety of malignancies
including breast, head and neck, and ovarian cancer (16, 18).
The intracellular localization of EGFR may therefore have
profound effects on response both to chemotherapy and to
novel therapies inhibiting the EGFR pathway.
EGFR cellular distribution is dictated by several regulatory
motifs within the juxtamembrane (JX) domain (19). Two

basolateral signals control EGFR re-sorting to the transmembrane (20), whereas the lysosomal signal (accessible following
EGFR activation) determines EGFR degradation (21). The
nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, comprising 13
amino acids 645 to 657 (RRRHIVRKLLRR; ref. 22), has a dual
role. It allows nuclear translocation via sequence recognition
and binding to importin b (23) and mediates EGFR allosteric
conformational change and dimer stabilization, which are
indispensable for the receptor activation (24, 25).
Studies on the somatically acquired, constitutively active
EGFR mutant L858R, found in certain non–small cell lung
cancers, have shown impaired nuclear localization and DNAPKcs binding (26). This suggests that EGFR activation and
nuclear translocation are related and that nuclear localization
may modulate DNA repair.
Nuclear translocation of EGFR following ionizing radiation (IR) has been shown to result in increased repair of DNA
strand breaks (12). The effects of nuclear translocation on
repair of chemotherapy-induced DNA damage are less clear.
We therefore investigated the significance of nuclear localization for the repair of cisplatin- and IR-induced DNA
damage, using EGFR constructs with mutations in the
NLS and mutations found in human cancers (EGFRvIII,
L858R). Cells expressing EGFR with mutations that impair
nuclear transport showed reduced repair of DNA strand
breaks following IR and reduced unhooking of interstrand
cross-links following treatment with cisplatin, as compared
with cells expressing wild-type (wt) EGFR. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed association of EGFR with
DNA-PKcs following treatment with cisplatin or IR. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated that cells with mutations in the
NLS failed to translocate to the nucleus following IR and
cisplatin treatment. These findings confirm the importance
of nuclear translocation of EGFR in mediating effects on
DNA repair and emphasize the significance of subcellular
EGFR expression in determining responses to therapy.

Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis
The plasmid DNA used was the pUSEamp vector (Upstate
Cell Signaling Solutions).
The wtEGFR and the L858R constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Daphne Bell and Matthew Meyerson from the
MGH Cancer Centre, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.
The NLS mutant constructed used the wtEGFR and the
L858R plasmids as a template. The 2 designed and SDSpurified mutagenic primers (forward: 50 -CCTCTTCATGGCAGCGGCCCACATCGTTGCGAAGGCCACGCTGGCGGCGCTGCTGCAGG-30 ; and reverse: 50 -CCTGCAGCAGCGCCGCCAGCGTGGCCTTCGCAACGATGTGGGCCGCTGCCATGAAGAGG-30 ) were utilized according to the site-directed mutagenesis XL kit protocol (Stratagene) to change the EGFR NLS
sequence 645-RRRHIVRKRTLRR-657 into 645-AAAHIVAKATLAA-657.
EGFRvIII was kindly provided by Prof. William Gullick from
the Department of Biosciences University of Kent, Canterbury,
UK.
EGFR M1, M12, KMT, and DNLS encoding point mutations
of the EGFR NLS sequence (M1: AAAHIVRKRTLRR; M12:
AAAHIVAAATLRR), the deletion of the NLS sequence (DNLS),
and a mutation within the kinase domain (KMT: K821A) were
kindly obtained from Prof. M.C. Hung (MD Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston, TX).
Plasmid transfection
Cells were plated at 1  105/mL, and following 2 hours, cells
were transfected according to the GeneJuice transfection
reagent protocol (Novagen EMD Bioscience). Cells were then
treated 48 hours following transfection, or serum starved for
24 hours and then treated.
Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay
Measurement of DNA interstrand cross-links was done as
previously described (27).
Repair of DNA strand break in cells irradiated with a dose of
15 Gy was measured using the comet assay as previously
described (28).
Data were presented as a percentage of tail moment, that is,
as a percentage of the amount of strand breaks resulting
immediately following IR treatment.
Statistical analysis
The 2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's posttests, and Student's t
test were used for calculating the significance of the differences in repair and DNA-PK activity. All the cell lines were
considered individually and compared with the wtEGFRexpressing cell line. Statistical values of P < 0.01 were considered significant.
Immunoprecipitation
Stably expressing NIH3T3 cell lines were plated at 2  105/
mL and left overnight before treatment. Cells were then
incubated in growing medium or treated with 50 mmol/L
cisplatin for 1 hour in serum-free media and then left in
drug-free medium for 18 hours, or serum starved for 24 to 36
hours and treated with 100 ng/mL EGF or treated with 4-Gy IR

and incubated 20 minutes in serum-free media. Approximately 5  106 cells were lysed on ice in 500 mL of CelLyticM
Cell lysis reagent (Sigma) supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitor (Roche) and Benzonase (Merck)
according to manufacturer's protocol. A 1.5 mg sample of
protein was incubated with 2 mg of anti-EGFR antibody (clone
R19/48; Invitrogen) and left rotating at 4 C for 2.5 hours.
Immunoprecipitation was done as previously described (29).
Western blotting
Western blotting was done as previously described (27).
Proteins were probed using anti-EGFR (Cell Signaling; 1:1,000),
anti-DNA-PKcs (AbCam; 1:400), anti-PY20 (Santa Cruz;
1:1,000). Finally, the primary antibody was probed with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated polyclonal antibodies for chemiluminescence detection with the ECL System (Amersham
Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence staining
A total of 2 104 cells were plated on 13-mm glass cover
slips (VWR). Cells were then treated with cisplatin and IR as
detailed earlier and stained as previously described (26).
Respective primary antibodies were added as follows: antirabbit EGFR (1:50, clone 15F8; Cell Signaling) and anti-mouse
DNA-PKcs (1:50; AbCam). Then, secondary fluorescent conjugated antibodies were added as follows: 1:100 Alexa Fluor
647 goat anti-rabbit and 1:100 Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse
(Molecular Probes and Invitrogen Life Technologies). Cells
were visualized by confocal microscopy (objective: 40; Leica
TCS SP2). Nuclear slice images were acquired by sequential
scanning by using the LAS AF Lite program.
DNA-PK functional assay
DNA-PK activity was detected using the Promega SignaTECT DNA-PK assay system, according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The enzymatic activity of DNA-PK was analyzed by
scintillation counting and expressed as a percentage change of
control DNA-PK activity as measured in untreated cells.
Proximity ligation assay
Proximity ligation was done according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the Duolink Detection Kit (Cambridge BioScience Ltd.). NIH3T3 cells were grown on 13-mm
glass cover slips (VWR) and treated with cisplatin or IR as
detailed earlier. Immunofluorescence staining protocol was
carried out until the primary antibody incubation. Cy3 signal
amplification was utilized for the assay. Cells were examined
with a confocal microscope (objective: 40; Leica TCS SP2).

Results
EGFR nuclear translocation modulates DNA repair
The synergistic effects of both cisplatin and IR with EGFR
inhibition have been well described (12, 23). However, the role
and consequences of EGFR nuclear translocation and kinase
activation in the repair of drug-induced DNA interstrand
cross-links, or radiation-induced DNA strand breaks, have
not been fully examined. To probe the role of EGFR in

modulating DNA repair, the EGFR-negative cell line NIH3T3
was transfected with each of 10 plasmids [wtEGFR, NLS123,
L858R, LNLS123, EGFRvIII, M1, M12, KMT, DNLS, and vector
control (VC)], and therapy-induced DNA damage and its
repair were assessed. The resulting transfectants express
either wtEGFR or mutations within the NLS sequence
(NLS123, LNLS123, M1, M12, and DNLS), kinase domain
(L858R, KMT), or extracellular domain (EGFRvIII) of EGFR
(Fig. 1A). Their expression was confirmed over a period of 72
hours following transfection (Supplementary Data S1). Transfected cells were incubated with 50 mmol/L cisplatin for 1 hour
or treated with 15 Gy IR. Formation and repair of cisplatininduced interstrand cross-links, critical cytotoxic lesions produced following drug treatment, were measured over a 48hour period by a modification of the comet assay as previously
described (ref. 27; Fig. 1B). Repair of IR-induced strand breaks
was measured over a 4-hour period (Fig. 1C).
There was no alteration in the formation of the peak of DNA
interstrand cross-links by cisplatin in cells expressing any of
the constructs (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary
Table S1). However, cells expressing mutations of the NLS
sequence (NLS123, LNLS123) and of the kinase domain
(L858R, KMT, DNLS) clearly showed reduction in repair
(unhooking) of interstrand cross-links (Fig. 1B). Unhooking
of cisplatin-induced interstrand cross-links was greater than
95% by 36 hours and complete by 48 hours in cells expressing
wtEGFR and EGFRvIII. In contrast, cells expressing mutations
NLS123 and LNLS123 showed only 26%  4.07% and 19.3% 
4.8% unhooking at 48 hours, respectively. Intermediate levels
of unhooking were observed for the L858R (46.57%  2.13%),
KMT (54.95%  2,56%), and DNLS (57.21%  9.72%) mutants,
whereas M1- and M12-expressing cell lines showed 84.09% 
4.87% and 97.41%  2.73% unhooking of interstrand crosslinks, respectively, at 48 hours following cisplatin treatment.
Statistical analysis showed significance (P < 0.01) at the 48hour time points and/or at earlier time points among the
different mutants (Table 2A Supplementary Data).
The effect of the EGFR constructs on repair of DNA strand
breaks induced by IR was also investigated. Repair of IRinduced DNA strand breaks is shown as the percentage of the
IR-induced tail moment calculated from the comet assay data
(Fig. 1C). Decrease of tail moment was 100% in both wtEGFRand EGFRvIII-expressing cell lines at 4 hours following treatment, indicating complete repair of strand breaks. Significant
differences (P < 0.001) in repair kinetics between wtEGFR and
the mutant EGFR-expressing cell lines were found at 30
minutes following IR (Table 2B Supplementary Data). At 4
hours, cells expressing NLS123 and LNLS123 showed significant delay in repair of strand breaks with 22.48%  3.72% and
24.94  1.45% unrepaired strand breaks, respectively. Intermediate levels of repair were observed for cells expressing
L858R (12.33  1.00%), KMT (18.86  3.45%), DNLS (17.38 
5.06%), M1 (8.51  1.12%), and M12 (9.28  2.26%) plasmids.

Western blot analysis showed that in cells expressing wtEGFR
and EGFRvIII, there is association with DNA-PKcs following
treatment with IR or cisplatin. However, cells expressing
NLS123, L858R, and LNLS123 showed no interaction between
EGFR and DNA-PKcs. The immunoprecipitated samples were
also blotted with a pan-phosphotyrosine antibody to determine the activity of EGFR. Cells expressing wtEGFR showed
maximal activation of the receptor following EGF treatment.
Intermediate levels of activation were detected following IR or
cisplatin treatment. L858R-, LNLS123-, and EGFRvIII-expressing cells showed a constitutive activation of the receptor,
whereas NLS123 showed no receptor activation. Therefore, the
EGFR-DNA-PKcs binding is triggered by cisplatin or IR treatment and not by the EGFR nuclear translocation per se.

DNA-PKcs and EGFR localize in the same cellular
compartments following IR or cisplatin treatment
Having established an association between EGFR and DNAPKcs following cisplatin or IR treatment, we investigated their
cellular localization by confocal microscopy following IR and
cisplatin treatment. Cell transiently transfected with wtEGFR
and EGFRvIII showed clear EGFR nuclear expression following cisplatin (Fig. 3) or IR treatment (Fig. 4). In contrast, cells
transiently transfected with NLS123, L858R, LNLS123, KMT,
and DNLS showed a lack of EGFR nuclear accumulation. M1and M12-transfected cells showed only reduced EGFR nuclear
expression following IR or cisplatin treatment. Next, stably
transfected cells were utilized to investigate this pattern. Cells
expressing wtEGFR and EGFRvIII showed nuclear expression
of both EGFR and DNA-PKcs following cisplatin (Fig. 5) or IR

impaired EGFR nuclear localization following cisplatin or IR
treatment. Expression of EGFR and DNA-PKcs was exclusively
cytosolic in NLS123- and LNLS123-expressing cell lines following cisplatin (Fig. 5) or IR treatment (Fig. 6). Therefore, the
NLS123 mutation inhibits EGFR nuclear localization and also
indirectly inhibits DNA-PKcs subcellular localization following IR or cisplatin treatment. Nuclear translocation of EGFR
was verified via cellular fractionation following cisplatin and
IR treatment (data not shown).
EGFR and DNA-PKcs association following cisplatin or
IR treatment
Previous studies have shown binding between EGFR and
DNA-PKcs in the nucleus following EGFR nuclear translocation (23, 32). To investigate the colocalization of EGFR and
DNA-PKcs following treatment with cisplatin or IR, we conducted a Duolink proximity assay. This assay allows visualization of the interaction between 2 proteins in fixed cells. Each
interaction is represented via a single red fluorescent dot
(Fig. 7A). In cells expressing vector and NLS123 constructs, no
interaction was detectable. In contrast, cells expressing
wtEGFR and EGFRvIII showed subcellular interaction

between EGFR and DNA-PKcs following IR or cisplatin

EGFR modulation of DNA-PK activity
We previously showed that the association of EGFR and
DNA-PKcs resulted in stimulation of DNA-PKcs activity (31).
The experiments detailed earlier showed that nuclear translocation of EGFR is required for the association with DNAPKcs. To investigate whether this association resulted in an
alteration in enzyme activity, we investigated the effects of
expression of different EGFR constructs on DNA-PK kinase
activity. As compared with individual untreated control,
cells expressing wtEGFR showed a 27.5%  7.22% increase
in DNA-PK activity following IR treatment (4 Gy) and a
37.52%  4.01% increase following 50 mmol/L cisplatin
treatment for 1 hour (Fig. 7B). In cells expressing EGFRvIII,
there was a 32.42%  16.58% increase in DNA-PK activity
following IR treatment and a 26.6%  8.49% increase following cisplatin treatment. In contrast, no significant change in
DNA-PK activity compared with controls was found in
L858R- and LNLS123-expressing cells following IR (5.29%
 8.27% and 2.72%  7.06%) or cisplatin treatment (9.04%
 3.46% and 2.25%  6.07%). Results are shown in

showed a clear decrease in DNA-PK kinase activity compared with control following IR (36.95%  8.08%) or
cisplatin treatment (43.30%  5.82%). Therefore, nuclear
localization is required for EGFR-induced stimulation of
DNA-PK activity. EGF treatment did not induce a significant
change in DNA-PK kinase activity (P > 0.05) in NLS123-,
LNLS123-, and EGFRvIII-expressing cell lines; only L858R
showed borderline significant differences (P < 0.05) compared with the wtEGFR-expressing cells.

Discussion
Inhibitors of EGFR play a major role in cancer therapeutics.
However, the activity of these agents as monotherapies is low,
and it is important to investigate regimens with optimal
combinations by using chemotherapy and radiation (3). There
is evidence of the effects of EGFR inhibition on DNA repair
following irradiation. In this study, we show the importance of
nuclear EGFR in modulating the repair of DNA damage
following cisplatin chemotherapy or radiation.

Expression of EGFR in the nucleus is well established, but
the implications on the effects of therapy are not clear.
According to recent reports, EGFR nuclear translocation
requires receptor dimerization and activation, as, following
internalization, mature and active EGFR may become a poor
substrate for lysosomal degradation (33, 34). This allows either
indirect sorting of the receptor through the Golgi or direct
sorting through the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequent association with Sec61 results in retrotranslocation to the cytosol
where EGFR is stabilized following association with HSP70
(33). Binding of importin b, mediated through the NLS
sequence, translocates the receptor to the nucleus (22, 33).
Inactive receptors (or those without an active conformation)
are usually sent back to the plasma membrane via the
recognition of a basolateral signal in the JX domain (19).
The interaction of EGFR with DNA-PKcs has been shown in
several studies (12). The DNA-PK complex plays a key role in
NHEJ, the major method of repair of DNA strand breaks
following IR treatment. Interaction of EGFR with DNA-PKcs
has been shown to contribute to the repair of DNA strand

1110

breaks. Inhibition of EGFR, by cetuximab or gefitinib, inhibits
repair of IR-induced DNA strand breaks and impairs EGFR–
DNA-PKcs interaction (4, 11).
It is well known that interstrand cross-links contribute
significantly to cisplatin cytotoxicity and that unhooking of
interstrand cross-links may be used to determine clinical
sensitivity (35). In previous studies, we showed that the
unhooking of cisplatin DNA interstrand cross-links was inhibited by gefitinib and that this is mediated through the DNA-PK
pathway (31). This pathway has been shown to have relevance
in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage (36).
In this study, we show that EGFR nuclear expression in
transfected EGFR-null cells modulates repair of DNA damage
through the DNA-PK pathway. Cells expressing EGFR constructs with mutated NLS sequence are inhibited in their
ability to unhook DNA interstrand cross-links (35). Abrogation
of nuclear expression of EGFR results in significant delay in
repair of interstrand cross-link in these cells. This correlates
with reduced association of EGFR with DNA-PKcs. Cells

showed increased sensitivity to cisplatin (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Previous studies have shown that EGFR nuclear
translocation correlated with repair of IR-induced strand
breaks.
It has been shown previously that the association between
DNA-PKcs and EGFR peaks at 20 minutes following IR treatment (37), but association following cisplatin treatment has
not been described. Here, we show that binding peaks at 18
hours following cisplatin treatment. The different timing
following cisplatin and IR treatment likely reflects different
types of DNA lesions and repair mechanisms. There was
reduced repair of DNA IR-induced strand breaks in cells
expressing EGFR constructs that do not translocate to the
nucleus. Repair of DNA strand breaks following IR treatment
has been shown to be modulated by EGFR (37) and the less
marked effects of impaired EGFR nuclear translocation as
compared with the repair of cisplatin-induced interstrand
cross-links may be secondary to the activation of other
DNA repair pathways (12).

In this study, the nuclear translocation of EGFR was shown
by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, these experiments suggest that there is colocalization of EGFR and DNA-PKcs both
within the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although the primary
location of DNA-PKcs is in the nucleus in the formation of
complexes on damaged DNA, cytoplasmic expression of DNAPKcs has been shown in several studies (38–40). The results of
the Proximity ligation assay show physical proximity of DNAPKcs and EGFR following DNA damage by cisplatin or IR
treatment in cells with intact nuclear localization. This was
not shown in cells expressing EGFR constructs deficient in
nuclear localization.
There is contradictory evidence regarding nuclear expression of EGFRvIII. Although EGFRvIII and STAT3 colocalization within the nucleus was shown in some studies (17, 41),
other studies have reported a lack of nuclear expression in
glioma models (42). Cells expressing EGFRvIII show elevated
activation of DNA-PKcs and enhancement of DNA strand
breaks repair. In this study, we show that EGFRvIII and

Although cells expressing kinase-dead EGFR showed a lack

resulted in impaired nuclear expression despite constitutive

Moreover, the difference in repair between cells expressing
L858R (kinase active but with impaired nuclear localization)
and M1or M12 (kinase active and expressed in the nucleus)
suggests that it is the impaired nuclear EGFR accumulation
(which is a consequence of the lack of allosteric activation)
and not kinase activity per se that determines the reduced
DNA repair in these models.

EGFR Nuclear Localization and DNA Repair

The impaired kinase activity shown by the NLS123 mutant
supports the previously described allosteric mode of activation of EGFR and the importance played by the third cluster of
arginines (646-RR-647) within the NLS sequence in adopting
an a-helical conformation that is indispensable for EGFR
activation (25, 34). The impairment of other EGFR functions,
as a result of mutations in the NLS sequence, has not been
excluded. Interestingly, the LNLS123 mutant shows kinase
activation despite bearing the same NLS mutation that renders the NLS123 kinase dead. This suggests that the L858R
mutation, which has been shown to thermodynamically stabilize EGFR (44, 45), allows receptor activation that does not
require the allosteric conformational change. Further work
will be required to investigate whether the L858R inhibition of
nuclear translocation is due to a structurally hidden NLS
sequence.
EGFR inhibition by gefitinib has been shown to suppress
DNA repair following treatment with radiation and cisplatin
(31). Similarly, in this study, the kinase-dead mutant KMT
(mutation K721A) shows no nuclear localization, suggesting
that the targeting of the EGFR kinase domain interferes with
nuclear translocation and consequently with repair. Maximal
effect of gefitinib on the inhibition of interstrand cross-links
was observed only in EGFR constructs translocating to the
nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S4). A recent study showed that
cisplatin resistance and DNA repair were dependent on
nuclear translocation (23). Here, we have shown that a variety
of EGFR mutants deficient in nuclear expression show
impaired repair and that nuclear accumulation is a major
determinant of repair of cisplatin-induced interstrand crosslinks. In addition, we recently showed that the expression of
HER2 modulated repair of cisplatin-induced interstrand
cross-links and that this also requires nuclear expression
(27). Other factors, including ubiquitination of EGFR induced
by cisplatin in head and neck cancer cells, may contribute to
the interaction between cisplatin and the EGFR pathway in
therapy (46).
There has been extensive study on the interaction of the
EGFR and DNAPK pathways. Following the initial observation
that cetuximab treatment inhibits EGFR–DNA-PKcs interaction (47), the role of this interaction in the modulation of DNA

repair has been confirmed. Cells expressing specific EGFR
mutations found in human cancer such as the L858R in non–
small cell lung cancer have been found to show sensitivity to
IR. This includes delayed DNA repair kinetics, defective IRinduced arrest in DNA synthesis, and increased apoptosis (26).
Here, we show that inhibition of EGFR nuclear translocation
alters DNA-PKcs cellular distribution.
Stimulation of DNA-PK kinase activity was associated with
nuclear expression and binding. There are likely other factors
apart from EGFR–DNA-PKcs binding that may influence the
effect of EGFR on DNA repair. EGF induces nuclear translocation of EGFR, but this is not associated with EGFR–DNA-PKcs
interaction. Receptor kinase activation may influence, indirectly, DNA-PK possibly by the activation of the AKT pathway,
which has been shown to be a kinase of DNA-PKcs (48, 49).
These results suggest that nuclear expression of EGFR plays
a significant role in response to cisplatin and radiation. The
intracellular localization of EGFR may play a critical part in
response to therapies combining inhibitors of the EGFR pathway with chemotherapy or radiation. Understanding of the
mechanisms by which nuclear expression modulates therapeutic effects of these modalities will optimize design of
clinical studies in the future.
