Abstract
Knowledge of the molecular background of functional magnetic resonance (MR) images is required to fully
exploit their potential in cancer management. We explored the prognostic impact of dynamic contrastenhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters in cervical cancer combined with global gene expression data to
reveal their underlying molecular phenotype and construct a representative gene signature for the relevant
parameter. On the basis of 78 patients with cervical cancer subjected to curative chemoradiotherapy, we
identiﬁed the prognostic DCE-MRI parameter ABrix by pharmacokinetic analysis of pretreatment images based
on the Brix model, in which tumors with low ABrix appeared to be most aggressive. Gene set analysis of 46
tumors with pairwise DCE-MRI and gene expression data showed a signiﬁcant correlation between ABrix and
the hypoxia gene sets, whereas gene sets related to other tumor phenotypes were not signiﬁcant. Hypoxia gene
sets speciﬁc for cervical cancer created in cell culture experiments, including both targets of the hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF1a) and the unfolded protein response, were the most signiﬁcant. In the remaining 32
tumors, low ABrix was associated with upregulation of HIF1a protein expression, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, consistent with increased hypoxia. On the basis of the hypoxia gene sets, a signature of 31
genes that were upregulated in tumors with low ABrix was constructed. This DCE-MRI hypoxia gene signature
showed prognostic impact in an independent validation cohort of 109 patients. Our ﬁndings reveal the
molecular basis of an aggressive hypoxic phenotype and suggest the use of DCE-MRI to noninvasively identify
patients with hypoxia-related chemoradioresistance. Cancer Res; 72(20); 5285–95. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable tool
in cancer management, and is widely used for staging, treatment planning, and response monitoring (1). Functional MRI,
such as dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, provides biologic information related to tumor physiology (2). There is a
growing interest to use dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) to improve patient care by integrating anatomical and functional features (3). Locally advanced cervical
cancer is one of the malignant diseases for which the inclusion
of DCE-MRI could be helpful in clinical decision-making (1).
Radiotherapy, often combined with cisplatin, is the primary
treatment of choice and is challenging because of the risk of
severe radiotoxicity in critical organs within the pelvis (4).

Studies have suggested that DCE-MRI of cervical cancer depicts
functional features associated with progressive disease (5–8).
The ability of the technique to visualize tumor aggressiveness
has, however, hardly been used, partly because the biologic
meaning of the images is not completely understood (9).
DCE-MRI measures the temporal uptake pattern of a contrast
agent in the tumor. When gadopentetate dimeglumine (GdDTPA) is used as contrast agent, the uptake mostly depends on
the blood perfusion and the volume of the extracellular space
(2). Biologic information can be extracted from the images by
pharmacokinetic analysis of the uptake curves, where the Tofts
and Brix models are most commonly applied (10). The Brix
model has been recommended because the concentration of
contrast agent in blood, that is, the arterial input function, is
not needed in the calculations, making it particularly attractive
for use in clinical routines (9). To fully exploit the potential of
such models, a robust DCE-MRI biomarker should be identiﬁed
and its molecular background clariﬁed. Global gene expression
proﬁles provide a detailed picture of the transcriptional program in tumors and thereby insight into the molecular phenotype. A few studies combining imaging and gene expression
data have so far emerged, conveying results that encourage
further work using this approach (11, 12).
In this study, we aimed to clarify the prognostic potential of
the DCE-MRI Brix model parameters in patients with cervical
cancer subjected to curative chemoradiotherapy and explore

their molecular background by use of gene expression proﬁles.
In a cohort of 78 patients, we carried out pharmacokinetic
analyses of pretreatment DCE-MR images and generated
parameter histograms of each tumor to account for the
intratumor heterogeneity in physiologic conditions. For the
most prognostic parameter, the percentiles showing the strongest association with survival were used to extract a DCE-MRI
parameter that was combined with global gene expression
data. We further searched for a gene signature that reﬂected
this parameter and contained molecular information about the
potential aggressive phenotype visualized in the images. Our
study shows the feasibility of this approach to decipher the
molecular background of functional images and to identify a
gene signature that reﬂects an aggressive cancer phenotype.

was recorded before the bolus injection and 13 after. The
temporal resolution was 15 seconds for the ﬁrst 11 image
series and 1 minute for the remaining 2 series.

where S(t) is the signal intensity at time t, and S(0) is the
signal intensity in the precontrast images. Using Levenberg–
Marquardt least squares minimization (14), the Brix model (10)
was ﬁtted to the uptake curve of each tumor voxel, using the

Image analysis
The tumor outline was assessed in axial T2-weighted images
by an experienced radiologist, and transferred to the DCE
series by coordinate mapping (Fig. 1A; ref. 7). The relative
signal increase (RSI) was used as measure of the uptake of
contrast agent and was calculated for each tumor voxel and
time point, using the relation:

Patients and tumor specimens
A total of 187 patients with cervical carcinoma, prospectively
recruited to our chemoradiotherapy protocol at the Norwegian
Radium Hospital from 2001 to 2006, were included (Supplementary Table S1). Pretreatment DCE-MRI images suitable for
analysis were available for 78 patients (DCE-MRI cohort).
Three additional patients in our previous descriptive DCEMRI study (7) were excluded because of unsatisfactorily ﬁtting
of the pharmacokinetic model. The remaining 109 patients
served as an independent validation cohort based on their gene
expression proﬁles. Possible pathologic lymph nodes in the
pelvis at the time of diagnosis were evaluated by MRI, according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version
1.1 (13). All patients were treated with external radiation of
50 Gy to the tumor, parametria, and adjacent pelvic wall, and
with 45 Gy to the remaining part of the pelvic region. This was
followed by brachytherapy of 21 Gy to point A. Adjuvant
cisplatin (40 mg/m2) was given weekly during the course of
external radiation. Follow up consisted of clinical examinations, and when symptoms of relapse were seen, MR imaging of
pelvis and retroperitoneum as well as X-ray of thorax were
carried out. Relapse (progressive disease) was classiﬁed as
locoregional (regression within the irradiated ﬁeld), distant, or
both.
One to 4 tumor biopsies, approximately 5  5  5 mm in size,
were taken before the start of therapy, immediately snap
frozen, stored at 80 C, and used for gene expression analysis.
A separate specimen was ﬁxed in 4% buffered formalin, parafﬁn-embedded, and used for immunohistochemistry. The
study was approved by the regional committee of medical
research ethics in southern Norway, and written informed
consent was achieved from all patients.

where ABrix is the amplitude, kep the transfer rate of tracer from
tissue to plasma, and kel the clearance rate of the tracer from
plasma. The parameters were allowed to vary freely in the
ﬁtting, except for the constraints ABrix, kep, kel  0. Parameter
maps were created to visualize the distribution of parameter
values within the tumors (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To
investigate the correlation between the parameters and clinical
outcome, a percentile screening method presented previously
(7) was applied. In brief, for each tumor, a parameter histogram
was generated and percentile values from the 1st to the 100th
percentile were calculated (Fig. 1B and data not shown). On the
basis of their nth percentile value, the patients were separated
into 2 equally sized groups, and log-rank tests were employed
to assess whether the risk of relapse differed signiﬁcantly
between the 2 groups. The relative risk (RR) and its 95%
conﬁdence interval (CI) were plotted as a function of percentile, and for ABrix, the prognostic parameter was calculated as
the mean value over the percentile interval with the most
signiﬁcant RR; that is, with the strongest association to outcome (Fig. 1C). For kep and kel, the associations with survival
were nonsigniﬁcant or signiﬁcant only within a small percentile interval (Supplementary Fig. S1), and they were therefore
not included in further analyses.

DCE-MRI
A 1.5 T Signa Horizon LX tomography (GE Medical Systems)
with a pelvic-phased array coil was used for MRI. Standard T1and T2-weigthed imaging was carried out in addition to DCEMRI. To record the DCE-MRI series, an axial T1-weighted fast
spoiled gradient recalled sequence was used (7). Gd-DTPA (0.1
mmoL/kg body weight; Magnevist; Schering) was administered
as a fast bolus injection. The sequence of DCE-MRI included 14

Cell lines and hypoxia treatment
The HeLa, SiHa, and CaSki cervical cancer cell lines from
American Type Culture Collection were used to generate
cervical cancer–speciﬁc gene sets of hypoxia responsive genes.
The cells were identity tested before the experiments by short

tumor specimens using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and from
the cell lines using RNeasy MiniKit (Quiagen). cRNA was
synthesized, labeled, and hybridized to the arrays. Signal
extraction and quantile normalization were carried out by
the software provided by the manufacturer (Illumina Inc.).

Log-transformed data were used in the analyses. All clinical
specimens had more than 50% (median 70%) tumor cells in
hematoxilin and eosin stained sections derived from the
central part of the biopsy. RNA from different biopsies of the
same tumor was pooled. The Illumina data have been deposited to the GEO repository (GSE36562).
Computational analysis of gene expression proﬁles
To explore biologic processes associated with ABrix, a list of
genes was generated from the expression proﬁles of 46 DCEMRI patients, based on the Spearman rank correlation between
gene expression and ABrix. A cut off P-value of 0.05 was used to
achieve an appropriate number of genes for further analysis.
The gene ontology (GO) categories of the correlating genes
were compared with those of all genes on the array using the
master-target procedure with the Fisher's exact test in the
eGOn software, where a multiple testing algorithm was used to
control the false discovery rate (FDR; ref. 17). Furthermore,
the gene set analysis tool Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarrays
for Gene Sets (SAM-GS), which is based on the moderated tstatistic in SAM (18) and with the same multiple testing
procedure as above to control FDR, was used for a supervised
analysis on 16 gene sets comprising biologic processes that
were signiﬁcant in the GO analysis. Seven of the gene sets have
been published previously (19–24), 5 sets were based on the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and
Reactome pathway databases and 4 sets were generated from
the gene expression data of the hypoxia-treated cervical cancer
cell lines (Supplementary Methods S1). Since multiple gene
symbols may exist for the same genes, the symbols in the

various gene sets were altered to match those in our Illumina
data set and only genes that could be found in our data set were
included in the ﬁnal gene sets (Supplementary Methods S2).
For the gene set analysis, the patients were classiﬁed into a low
ABrix group or a high ABrix group, based on the median value of
ABrix in the 78 DCE-MRI patients. The Illumina data ﬁle was
reduced to one probe per gene by selecting the probe with the
greatest average difference between the low and high ABrix
groups.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out on 32 selected
tumors with the monoclonal mouse HIF1a antibody clone 54
(1:25, no. 610958; BD Transduction Laboratories), binding the
amino acid 610 to 727 on the HIF1a protein. The tissue sections
(4 mm) were stained using the Dako EnVisionTM Flexþ System
(K8012; Dako). For antigen retrieval, the PT-Link (Dako) and
EnVisionTM Flex target retrieval solution at a high pH were
used, and the sections were incubated with the HIF1a antibody
for 30 minutes. A cervical tumor known to express HIF1a was
used as a positive control, whereas as a negative control the
antibody was substituted with mouse myeloma protein of the
same concentration and subclass as the HIF1a antibody.
Nuclear staining was scored on the basis of the percentage of
positive tumor cells: 0, 0%; 1, 1% to 10%; 2, 11% to 25%; 3, 26% to
50%; 4, 51% to 75%; and 5, >75%. The cytoplasmic staining was
generally weak or absent, and was therefore not quantiﬁed. The
scoring was carried out by an experienced scientist at the
Department of Pathology (R.H.) who was blinded to the DCEMRI data.

, P < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney U test).

Statistics
Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparison of the
protein expression level of HIF1a in the patient group with
low ABrix versus high ABrix. In the survival analyses, the endpoint was progression-free survival, where the time from
diagnosis to cancer-related death or to the ﬁrst event of relapse
was used, or locoregional control, which was deﬁned as control
within the irradiated pelvic region including lymph nodes.
Thirteen patients died of causes not related to cancer and
were censored. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to
evaluate the prognostic value of various parameters with
respect to progression-free survival and locoregional control.
Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using log-rank test.
P-values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Patients with low ABrix have a poor outcome after
chemoradiotherapy
The prognostic potential of the DCE-MRI ABrix parameter
was explored by evaluating the relative risk of all percentiles in
the ABrix histograms, which enabled us to judge different parts
of the histograms separately and identify the one with the
strongest relationship to outcome (7). The lower ABrix values
harbored the strongest prognostic information, and a broad
range from the 6th to 59th percentile was associated with
progression-free survival at a signiﬁcance level below 0.08 (Fig.
1C), indicating considerable robustness in the ABrix parameter
(7). The interval from the 8th to 36th percentile had a significance level below 0.05, whereas the 20th to 30th percentiles
were the most signiﬁcant ones (RR < 0.44, P < 0.018; Fig. 1C).
The mean of ABrix values over the 20th to 30th percentiles was

www.aacrjournals.org

therefore used as the representative ABrix imaging parameter.
This ABrix parameter varied considerably among the patients,
ranging from 0.59 to 3.21, with a median of 1.50. Patients with
an ABrix below the median showed a poor outcome compared
with the others, and the probability of survival differed with
more than 30% at 5 years follow-up between the 2 groups (P ¼
0.004; Fig. 1D).
Low ABrix associates with upregulation of hypoxia
response genes and HIF1a protein
To examine whether the differences in ABrix among the
tumors were reﬂected in the transcriptional program of speciﬁc biologic processes, we combined the gene expression
proﬁles of 46 tumors with the DCE-MRI data. We ﬁrst used
an unsupervised GO analysis to obtain a general picture of the
biology in low ABrix tumors, where the genes with the highest
correlation between expression and ABrix were included. Four
major signiﬁcant processes were identiﬁed; metabolism, cell
cycle, cellular component organization and biosynthesis, and
response to DNA damage stimulus (Supplementary Table S2).
On the basis of these results, a supervised gene set analysis was
carried out on all genes on the array to more speciﬁcally
investigate phenotypes that could be reﬂected in ABrix. The
correlation between ABrix and the categories metabolism, cell
cycle, and cellular component organization and biosynthesis
could indicate both altered proliferation and presence of
hypoxia. Published gene sets associated with these phenotypes
were therefore included (20, 22–24). To cover the process
response to DNA damage stimulus, published gene sets representing intrinsic radioresistance were used (19, 21) as well as
the KEGG DNA repair pathways for nonhomologous end-

The cell-cycle checkpoints pathway from Reactome was also
included to represent both this process and the cell-cycle
category. Moreover, the KEGG pathway for protein processing

we included a published gene set associated with wound

tumor types (23).

checkpoints pathway was also signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.038), and a
closer look at its genes revealed that several of those that were
correlated with ABrix are known to be activated under hypoxia,
such as ATR and CHEK2 (25). Thus, ABrix seemed to be
associated with the transcriptional program regulated under
hypoxia.
The transcriptional hypoxia response has been shown to
differ among tumor types (26). A cervical cancer–speciﬁc
hypoxia gene set could possibly be more strongly associated
with ABrix than the gene sets used above and thus contain genes

that would be important for the creation of a robust gene
signature that reﬂected ABrix. We therefore generated hypoxia gene sets based on the expression proﬁles of cervical
cancer cells grown under hypoxia. HIF1a protein was upregulated in all 3 cell lines by the hypoxia treatment, whereas
only minor changes were observed in the cell-cycle distributions (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Four different gene
sets were generated from the hypoxia induced expression
changes; genes upregulated in all 3 cell lines, genes upregulated in one of the cell lines and conﬁrmed as hypoxia
regulated by the literature, and correspondingly for the
downregulated genes (Supplementary Methods S1 and S2).
In the second round of gene set analysis, the cervical cancer–
speciﬁc hypoxia gene sets with upregulated genes were
found to be the most signiﬁcant ones (Table 1). These results
supported the suggestion of a correlation between ABrix and
hypoxia, and showed that the cervical cancer–speciﬁc gene
sets could be useful in the construction of an ABrix gene
signature.

www.aacrjournals.org

To conﬁrm the above ﬁnding of a correlation between ABrix
and hypoxia, protein expression of HIF1a was assessed by
immunohistochemistry in the 32 remaining DCE-MRI patients
who had not been evaluated in the gene expression study.
HIF1a was selected as hypoxia marker because a hypoxiainduced HIF1a response was observed in the cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The patients with low ABrix had a
signiﬁcantly higher HIF1a expression compared with those
with high ABrix (P ¼ 0.004; Fig. 2A–C). In accordance with this
result, several of the HIF1a targets were upregulated in tumors
with low ABrix in the DCE-MRI patients used for gene expression analysis. We thus concluded that low ABrix was associated
with tumor hypoxia and upregulation of hypoxia response
genes.

gene sets (Table 1), and extracted the 31 genes with a negative
correlation between the gene expression and ABrix; that is, the
genes that were upregulated in tumors with low ABrix. Most of
these 31 genes are known to participate in biologic processes
affected by hypoxia, such as energy metabolism, cell cycle, and
proliferation, including HIF1a targets such as ALDOA, STC2,
and HMOX1 (27–29), and genes involved in the UPR (DDIT3,
STC2, ERO1L, and AK2; refs. 30–32; Table 2), suggesting that
several parts of the hypoxia induced transcriptional program
were reﬂected by ABrix.
To ensure that the signature sufﬁciently represented the
ABrix parameter, we carried out unsupervised clustering of
the 46 DCE-MRI patients based on the expressions of the
31 genes. Clustering showed 2 groups with different outcome,
for which the one with high expression of hypoxia responsive
genes had low ABrix (P < 0.001) and poor outcome (P ¼ 0.011)
as compared with the other (Fig. 3A). We further calculated
a hypoxia score for each tumor by averaging the median
centered expression levels for the 31 genes, as described
(26). In line with the above results, patients with a high hypoxia
score had low ABrix (P < 0.001) and poor outcome (P ¼ 0.011)
compared with the others (Fig. 3B). The DCE-MRI hypoxia
gene signature therefore seemed to satisfactorily represent
the ABrix parameter, including its relationship to clinical
outcome.

5292

Cancer Res; 72(20) October 15, 2012

The prognostic impact of the gene signature was further
validated in an independent cohort of 109 patients with
cervical cancer. In this validation set, the patients who clustered together because of high expression of the genes in the
signature had a signiﬁcantly worse outcome than the remaining patients (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 4A). When assessing the hypoxia
score in this cohort, the patients with a high score had a poor
outcome compared with those with a low score (P ¼ 0.006; Fig.
4B). The prognostic value of the signature was therefore
conﬁrmed. To assess the importance of the signature in
comparison with existing clinical markers, the patients from
the DCE-MRI cohort and the validation cohort were merged,
and a multivariate Cox analysis was carried out on the resulting
group of 155 patients. The hypoxia score emerged as a prognostic factor independent of lymph node status, FIGO stage,
and tumor volume for both progression-free survival and
locoregional control (Table 3).

Discussion
By integrating DCE-MRI and global gene expression data of
cervical cancers, we found that the images reﬂect a transcriptional program regulated under hypoxia. This program included a gene signature with prognostic impact in an independent
validation cohort, thus pointing to hypoxia-regulated

pathways that may promote cervical cancer aggressiveness.
Tumor hypoxia is a known prognostic factor in many types of
cancer, including cervical cancer (33), and would therefore be
valuable to implement in clinical decision-making. Our work is
the ﬁrst to provide molecular insight into the DCE-MR images
that could facilitate this strategy, encouraging the use of DCEMRI as a tool to handle hypoxia-induced chemoradioresistance in cervical cancer.
Several evidences for a relationship between low ABrix and
tumor hypoxia were provided by our work. The hypoxia gene
sets were signiﬁcantly associated with ABrix, and revealed
upregulation of hypoxia response genes including HIF1a targets in tumors with low ABrix. In line with this, tumors with low
ABrix had higher protein expression of HIF1a compared with
those with high ABrix. The results from the GO analysis were
also in accordance with these conclusions, as the biologic
processes metabolism, cell cycle, and DNA damage signaling,
which were associated with ABrix, are important targets for the
hypoxia response (25, 28, 34). In particular, genes from the
metabolism category encoding the glycolytic enzymes ALDOA,
GAPDH, and PFK4B4 were found to be upregulated in tumors
with low ABrix, consistent with the increased glycolytic activity
often seen in hypoxic tumors (28). Loncaster and colleagues (5)
showed a relationship between ABrix and oxygen tension in
cervical tumors, as measured by Eppendorf pO2 histography,
supporting our conclusion.
Extraction of genes from the hypoxia gene sets that were
upregulated in tumors with low ABrix resulted in a DCE-MRI
hypoxia gene signature that was associated with the clinical
outcome, independent of clinical markers for progression-free
survival. This suggests that the gene signature associated with
ABrix provides information of disease progression that is not
covered by the conventional clinical parameters. In addition,
the gene signature appeared as the most signiﬁcant factor for
locoregional control, indicating that hypoxia as measured by

www.aacrjournals.org

ABrix could be a well-needed biomarker of local recurrence
in cervical cancer. Furthermore, while previous studies have
demonstrated the importance of hypoxia in resistance to
radiotherapy (33), the strong prognostic impact of this hypoxia
gene signature indicates that hypoxia also inﬂuences the effect
of chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer patients.
The use of global gene expression data enabled detailed
insight into the transcriptional program reﬂected by ABrix. The
response to hypoxia occurs through different pathways, and
may involve activation of HIFs, the UPR or ER stress response,
and signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin
(MTOR) kinase (32). Eight of the 31 genes in the DCE-MRI
hypoxia gene signature are known HIF1a targets, namely
ALDOA, ERO1L, GAPDH, PFKFB4, P4HA2, C4orf3, HMOX1, and
STC2 (27, 29, 32, 35, 36), although SCARB1 is a target of HIF2
(the endothelial PAS domain protein 1, EPAS1; ref. 36). The
protein encoded by one of the other genes, RHOC, is indirectly
associated with HIF1a through its interaction with the von
Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL; ref. 37), which
degrades HIF1a. In addition, AK2, ERO1L, DDIT3 (also known
as CHOP), and STC2 have been found to be involved in the UPR
(30–32, 38). It thus seems that processes associated with both
HIF activation and UPR may be important in the hypoxic
phenotype depicted by low ABrix. The involvement of HIF
activation was further supported by the high HIF1a protein
expression in these tumors.
Current knowledge of how these genes inﬂuence cervical
cancer progression is sparse. However, several of them or their
encoded proteins, including STC2, PFKFB4, RHOC, S100A2,
HMOX1, and ISG15, have been associated with poor prognosis
in other cancer types (39–44). Moreover, upregulation of
ALDOA, GAPDH, and PFKFB4 suggest a high glycolytic activity,
as mentioned above, which has been associated with aggressiveness (28). Furthermore, SCARB1, PVR, and RPL36A
have been shown to promote rapid proliferation (45–47), and

AK4 may play a critical role in both cellular survival and
proliferation during stress conditions such as hypoxia (48).
Both DDIT3 and STC2 are targets of the activating transcription
factor ATF4, which is induced by the eukaryotic translation
initiation factor kinase EIF2AK3 (PERK) in response to hypoxia
(31, 32, 49). STC2 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and to
induce proliferation and invasiveness in response to HIF1a
or ER stress during hypoxia (27, 31, 50). DDIT3 on the other
hand, is a proapoptotic protein, but was recently shown to
protect tumor cells under hypoxia through the regulation of
autophagy, proposing a role in the balance between autophagy
and apoptosis (49). It may thus be speculated that the combined action of these 2 genes in tumors with low ABrix promotes
the adaption to hypoxia by inhibiting apoptosis and inducing
autophagy. Taken together, these studies support a role of the
signature genes in the development of an aggressive hypoxic
phenotype.
Using DCE-MRI to assess hypoxia associated aggressiveness
in cervical cancer is appealing because MRI is already in routine
use for patient diagnosis at many hospitals (1). Furthermore, the
use of noninvasive imaging to assess the molecular hypoxia
phenotype could potentially reduce the need of invasive biopsy
procedures and be carried out during the course of treatment for
response evaluation. ABrix seems to be a valuable DCE-MRI
parameter for this purpose because of its strong correlation to
outcome in our study. The robustness of the parameter, as
suggested by the percentile analysis of ABrix histograms, is
supported by the cervical cancer study of Loncaster et al. (5),
where ABrix also had prognostic impact although the patient
characteristics and MRI protocol differed from ours. In the

present work, we have showed how noninvasive imaging by
means of DCE-MRI and ABrix assessment may visualize hypoxia
and its molecular basis in chemoradioresistant tumors. Our
results may have important clinical implications in that they
suggest the use of DCE-MRI to identify patients with treatmentresistant tumors that may beneﬁt from additional or alternative
therapy targeting hypoxia.
