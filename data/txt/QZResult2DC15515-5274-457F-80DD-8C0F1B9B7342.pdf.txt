ABSTRACT
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) plays an important role in the control of the cell
cycle. We previously reported that the PP2A inhibitors, cantharidin and okadaic acid
(OA), efficiently repressed the growth of cancer cells. In the present study, we found
that PP2A inhibitors arrested the cell cycle at the G2 phase through a mechanism
that was dependent on the JNK pathway. Microarrays further showed that PP2A
inhibitors induced expression changes in multiple genes that participate in cell cycle
transition. To verify whether these expression changes were executed in a PP2Adependent manner, we targeted the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) using siRNA
and evaluated gene expression with a microarray. After the cross comparison of
these microarray data, we identified that CDK1 was potentially the same target when
treated with either PP2A inhibitors or PP2Ac siRNA. In addition, we found that the
down-regulation of CDK1 occurred in a JNK-dependent manner. Luciferase reporter
gene assays demonstrated that repression of the transcription of CDK1 was executed
through the JNK-dependent activation of the Sp1 transcription factor. By constructing
deletion mutants of the CDK1 promoter and by using ChIP assays, we identified
an element in the CDK1 promoter that responded to the JNK/Sp1 pathway after

stimulation with PP2A inhibitors. Cantharidin and OA also up-regulated the expression
of p21, an inhibitor of CDK1, via autophagy rather than PP2A/JNK pathway. Thus, this
present study found that the PP2A/JNK/Sp1/CDK1 pathway and the autophagy/p21
pathway participated in G2/M cell cycle arrest triggered by PP2A inhibitors.

indicating the JNK pathway dependent cytotoxicity of
PP2A inhibitors (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1).
In order to investigate whether G2/M cell cycle arrest was
also executed through the activation of JNK pathway,
we used flow cytometry, based on PI staining, to analyze
the cell cycle distribution. As shown in Figure 1B, PP2A
inhibitors induced cell accumulation at G2/M phase in a
dose-dependent manner, with concurrent decreases in cell
populations at G0/G1 and S phases, after 24 h treatment.
The level of G2/M aggregation was reduced by pretreatment
with SP600125, suggesting that PP2A inhibitors induced
G2/M arrest through a JNK dependent pathway.
As flow cytometry analysis based on PI staining
cannot distinguish between G2 and M cell cycle arrest,
because cells at both these phases are diploid; flow
cytometry analysis based on mithramycin A staining
was performed. [10] Colchicine, an established M phase
blocker, was used as the positive control for inducing
M phase cell cycle arrest. As shown in Figure 1C,
colchicine treated cells became round and detached;
and flow cytometry analysis, based on mithramycin
A staining, confirmed that the cells accumulated in M
phase. Similarly, cells treated with PP2A inhibitors also
became round and detached (Figure 1D). Furthermore,
pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, protected
cells from this morphological change; however, neither of
these treatments induced accumulation of cells in M phase
(Figure 1D), which suggested that G2/M cell cycle arrest
induced by PP2A inhibitors occurred at G2 phase.
The cell cycle transition is regulated by cyclin,
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors (CKIs). [11, 12] To investigate which
genes were involved in the cell cycle alteration triggered
by PP2A inhibitors, we performed microarray analyses to
determine the mRNA expressions of 72 genes participating
in cell cycle regulation. Among these genes, expression
changes of 21 genes consist with the decreases in cell
populations at G0/G1 and S phases, as well as arrested
G2/M transition in both cantharidin and OA treated groups
(Figure 1E), suggesting multiple genes were involved in
the cell cycle regulation by PP2A inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION
Natural products and their derivatives have shown
promising outcomes in cancer therapies. In our previous
study, we demonstrated that cantharidin, the active
constituent of Chinese blister beetle, [1] inhibited growth
of pancreatic and breast cancer cells, [2, 3] offering
a potential role for cantharidin in cancer treatment.
Cantharidin acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), [4] a multimeric serine/
threonine phosphatase that is generally considered to be
a cancer repressor. On one hand, inhibition of PP2A is
believed to have tumor-promoting function [5] through
induction of phosphorylation and activation of several
substrate kinases, including IKK (IκB kinase), JNK
(c-Jun N-terminal kinase), ERK (extracellular signalrelated kinase), p38, Akt, and PKC (protein kinase C),
most of which accelerate growth. [6, 7] On the other hand,
recent studies showed that PP2A inhibition by specific
inhibitors also elicit growth-suppressive effect through
several growth inhibition pathways, [8, 9] including the
JNK pathway that we reported previously. [2] Inhibition
of this pathway significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect
of cantharidin and okadaic acid (OA; another classic PP2A
inhibitor), [2] suggesting that inhibition of PP2A indeed
has tumor suppressive function. Thus, understanding the
molecular mechanism underlying the growth-suppressive
effect of PP2A inhibition will not only minimize the
unwanted side effect of PP2A inhibition but also facilitate
the development of PP2A inhibitors (i.e., cantharidin) as
new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.
In our previous study, we found that treatment with
PP2A inhibitors arrested G2/M cell cycle transition. [2]
However, it remained unknown whether G2/M cell cycle
arrest was induced through the JNK pathway dependent
manner, and whether G2/M arrest is sufficient to suppress
the growth of cancer cells. In the present study, we
dissected the detailed signaling mechanisms involved in
the G2/M cell cycle arrest and JNK dependent cell-killing
effect induced by PP2A inhibitors in pancreatic, breast and
lung cancer cells.

Previous study proved that PP2A inhibitors also
present an inhibition effect on PP1 (protein phosphatase 1).
[13] To investigate whether these expression changes of
cell cycle related genes were executed through a PP2A
inhibition dependent manner, we applied siRNA targeting
PP2A catalytic subunit α isoform (PP2Acα) [14] to get

profile by using microarray. Knockdown of PP2Acα was
firstly confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 2A). As α and
β isoforms of PP2Ac share similar coding sequence, [15]
we also tested the expression of PP2Acβ. As presented in
Figure 2A, expression of PP2Acβ was also repressed by
PP2Acα siRNA. By using primers targeting both α and
β isoforms, we confirmed the knockdown of total PP2Ac
expression (Figure 2A), which resulted in the downregulation of PP2Ac at protein level (Figure 2B).

Upon PP2Ac was knockdown, mRNA expression
profile was evaluated by using microarray. The expression
profiles upon treatment with PP2Acα siRNAs or PP2A
inhibitors were pairwise compared. As shown in Figure 2C,
Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that the
mRNA expression values correlated significantly, suggesting
the changes of expression profiles upon PP2A inhibitor
treatment were mainly through inhibition on PP2A.

and PP2Ac siRNAs, we identified that CDK1, the key
regulator of G2/M cell cycle transition, [16] was the
unique G2/M cell cycle regulator, which share the same
tendence in all treated groups (Figure 2D and Figure 1E),
suggesting the repression on CDK1 could be executed
through PP2A inhibition dependent manner.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The down-regulation of CDK1 by PP2A inhibitor
treatment was further confirmed at protein level by
western blot (Figure 2E). To investigate the role of CDK1
in PANC-1 cell cycle transition and cell growth, cells
were treated with RO-3306, a CDK1 inhibitor, and cell
cycle assay and MTT assay were performed. As shown
18472

Oncotarget

in Figure 2F and 2G, RO-3306 dose-dependently arrested
cell cycle in G2/M phase and repressed cell growth in both
dose-and time-dependent manner, suggesting CDK1 plays
an important role in PANC-1 cell growth. Furthermore,
pretreatment with RO-3306 impaired the cytotoxicity of
PP2A inhibitors (Figure 2H), suggesting CDK1 downregulation participated in the cytotoxicity induced by
PP2A inhibitors.
To define the relationship between JNK pathway
activation and CDK1 down-regulation, we pretreated cells
with SP600125 and evaluated mRNA and protein levels
of CDK1 upon treatment with PP2A inhibitors. As shown
in Figure 2I, 2J and Supplementary Figure 2, the downregulation of CDK1 could be reversed by pretreatment
with JNK inhibitor, suggesting that down-regulation
of CDK1 was through a JNK dependent pathway.
Pretreatment with RO-3306 impaired the protection
effect of JNK inhibitor against the cytotoxicity of PP2A
inhibitors (Figure 2K), suggesting the JNK pathway
dependent growth inhibition and G2/M cell cycle arrest
could be executed through down-regulation of CDK1.
Thus, the PP2A/JNK/CDK1 cell signaling transition
pathway dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest could be
involved in the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by
PP2A inhibitors.

repression of the CDK1 promoter (Figure 3D); real-time
PCR confirmed down-regulation of CDK1 expression
(Figure 3E); and MTT assays confirmed inhibition of cell
growth (Figure 3F). These results suggested that PP2A
inhibitors induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and repressed
cell growth through the PP2A/JNK/Sp1/CDK1 pathway.

Identification of the CDK1 promoter region
which responded to the PP2A/JNK/Sp1 pathway
Activated Sp1 can either be a transcriptional
activator or a repressor, depending on the stimulation,
cell type, and target DNA. [25] In this study, Sp1 acted
as a transcriptional activator when bound to the known
Sp1 binding sites, but behaved as a transcriptional
repressor when bound to the CDK1 promoter; therefore
we attempted to identify the region of the CDK1 promoter
that responded to Sp1 when treated with PP2A inhibitors.
The CDK1 promoter deletion constructs used for the
transient transfection analysis are illustrated in Figure 4A.
A significant increase of luciferase activity was observed
when the base pairs between -382 and -372 were deleted,
suggesting this region might contain the element that
responded to PP2A inhibitor treatment (Figure 4B).
The JNK inhibitor had no influence on the change in
transcriptional activity induced by PP2A inhibitors when
this region (-382 to -372 bp) was deleted (Figure 4C); but
attenuated transcriptional repression when this region was
present (Figure 4D). This suggested that PP2A inhibitors
decreased CDK1 transcription through JNK pathway
dependent repression of the CDK1 promoter region
between -382 and -372 bp.
ChIP assays were performed to confirm the binding
of Sp1 to this promoter region. As shown in Figure 4E,
binding of Sp1 to this region was increased by treatment
with PP2A inhibitors, but attenuated by pretreatment
with the JNK inhibitor, suggesting that JNK dependent
repression of this promoter region was mediated through
transcriptional factor Sp1. Because no known Sp1 binding
sites were found in this region, this indicated indirect
binding between Sp1 and this region.

PP2A inhibitors repressed CDK1 expression
through activation of Sp1 transcriptional factor
To investigate the mechanisms involved in JNK
dependent down-regulation of CDK1, we cloned the
CDK1 promoter [17, 18] into the pGL3-Basic luciferase
reporter vector and tested its transcriptional activity after
PP2A inhibition. As shown in Figure 3A, treatment with
PP2A inhibitors repressed the transcriptional activity of the
CDK1 promoter. Conversely, repression was attenuated
by pretreatment with SP600125, the JNK inhibitor, which
suggested that JNK dependent down-regulation of CDK1
was executed through repression of CDK1 transcription.
The transcriptional factor, Sp1, is a primary target of
the JNK pathway; [19–24] therefore, we used luciferase
reporter vectors containing the known Sp1 binding sites,
GGGCGG or GGGGCGGGGC, to investigate whether
Sp1 was involved in the JNK dependent down-regulation
of CDK1. As shown in Figure 3B, Sp1 was activated after
treatment with PP2A inhibitors; whereas pretreatment
with SP600125 repressed Sp1 activation, indicating that
PP2A inhibitors induced Sp1 activation through a JNK
dependent pathway.
We next investigated whether repression of the
CDK1 promoter, down-regulation of CDK1, and inhibition
of cell growth, which were induced by PP2A inhibitors,
were executed through Sp1 activation dependent manner.
Real-time PCR using target specific siRNAs confirmed
knockdown of Sp1 (Figure 3C). Luciferase reporter
gene assays proved that interference of Sp1 attenuated

PP2A inhibitors repressed cell growth through
PP2A/JNK pathway independent and autophagy
dependent up-regulation of p21
In our previous study, we have proved that expression
of p21, the key inhibitor of CDK1, [11, 12] was upregulated
upon treatment with PP2A inhibitors; [2] however, the
mechanisms involved were unclear. By using microarray,
we found that the down-regulation of p21 could be induced
by cantharidin and OA (Figure 1E), but did not present
when treated with PP2Acα siRNAs (Figure 2D), suggesting
cantharidin and OA repressed p21 expression through a PP2A
independent manner. To further verify whether activation
of JNK pathway participated in the down-regulation of

p21, we pretreated cells with SP600125 and evaluated p21
expression after treatment with cantharidin and OA. As
shown in Figure 5A, 5B and Supplementary Figure 3, both
the expression of p21 were up-regulated after PP2A inhibitor
treatment; however, pretreatment with SP600125 had no
repression on the level of up-regulation, suggesting that p21
up-regulation was not through PP2A/JNK pathway.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that
autophagy induction could arrest G2/M cell cycle transition
through up-regulation of p21. [26] In the present study, we
tried to investigate whether this mechanism could also be
involved. By using the DsRed-LC3 reporter, the increased
formation of LC3 punctate was observed following
the treatment with cantharidin and OA (Figure 5C and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting these reagents
induces autophagy in cancer cells. Pretreatment with 3-MA
(3-Methyladenine), a classic autophagy inhibitor, attenuated
or even reversed the stimulation on p21 expression by OA
and cantharidin (Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure 5),
suggesting the increased p21 expression was executed
through an autophagy dependent manner.
To find out whether the up-regulation of p21
contributed to the cytotoxicity of cantharidin and OA,
we used siRNA targeting p21 to block the p21 mediated
effect on cell growth. Knockdown of p21 by siRNA was
firstly confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 5E). As shown
in Figure 5F, knockdown of p21 impaired the repression
on cell growth by cantharidin and OA, suggesting the

autophagy dependent stimulation of p21 also participated
in the cytotoxicity of cantharidin and OA.

The specificity of PP2A inhibitors has always been
questioned for its slight inhibition effect on PP1 [13].
By using microarray, we confirmed that cantharidin
and OA share extremely similar effects on expression
on target genes. By using Spearman’s rank correlation
analysis, we found out that gene expression profiles of
both cantharidin and OA were significantly correlated
with PP2Ac knockdown groups. Thus, the present
study proved the effects of PP2A inhibitors were
mainly fulfilled through inhibition on PP2A, and both
cantharidin and OA are reliable tools for investigation
of PP2A. By using microarray, we identified that CDK1,
the key regulator of G2/M cell cycle transition was

DISCUSSION
JNK is a kinase that is evolutionarily conserved in
eukaryotes. [27] In our previous studies, the JNK pathway
was found to be overactivated by treatment with PP2A
inhibitors, [2, 28] which led to JNK dependent repression
of cell growth. [2, 28] In this study, we focused on cell
cycle regulation by the JNK pathway, and proved that
PP2A inhibitors arrested the cell cycle at G2 phase through
a JNK dependent manner.

up-regulated by PP2A inhibitors or PP2Acα targeting
siRNAs. For the first time, we have found that the
expression of CDK1 could be regulated by JNK pathway,
and that growth inhibition of PP2A inhibitors was
through the JNK/CDK1 pathway.
Sp1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that belongs
to the Sp/Kruppel-like factors (KLF) family, characterized
by their affinity for GC-rich promoter sequences, and is a
major downstream target of the JNK pathway. [19–24] Sp1
has been shown to regulate the expression of thousands of
genes involved in wide range of cellular processes, such
as proliferation, growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis;
[29, 30] therefore, we investigated whether the JNK
dependent repression of CDK1 was mediated through Sp1.
By using luciferase reporter gene assays, we demonstrated
that PP2A inhibitors induced JNK upregulation of
transcription at DNA sequences containing known Sp1
binding sites. This indicated that Sp1 was activated
through the PP2A/JNK pathway; however, transcription
of CDK1 was also repressed, suggesting that regulation of
Sp1 transcription was target specific.
Post-translational modifications of Sp1 have
been implicated in the regulation of Sp1. For example,
phosphorylation, glycosylation, sumoylation, acetylation,
and ubiquitination regulate Sp1 stability in a proteasomedependent manner; [19, 31,–33] in addition, phosphorylation
regulates the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of
Sp1. [25] The following studies have proved that JNK plays
an important role in the post-translational modification of
Sp1: JNK activation is necessary to phosphorylate Sp1,
[19, 23, 24] and to shield Sp1 from the ubiquitin-dependent
degradation pathway; [19] knockdown or inhibition of JNK
induced dephosphorylation resulted in the ubiquitination
and degradation of Sp1; [19–23] phosphorylation of Sp1
by JNK was found to promote DNA binding [34] and
transcription in some studies, [24, 35] but repress DNA
binding [23] in other studies. Interestingly, okadaic acid
(OA) was found to increase the level of Sp1 phosphorylation
[36–38] and prevent Sp1 degradation in a JNK dependent
way; [39] in addition, OA induced phosphorylation of Sp1
either promotes [38, 40] or represses [36] DNA binding,
depending on the stimulation and target DNA. These data
suggest that the post-translational modification of Sp1 may
be involved in the transcriptional repression of CDK1 upon
treatment with PP2A inhibitors.
Although no typical Sp1 binding sites were found
in the DNA sequence that responded to the PP2A/
JNK pathway, ChIP assays confirmed the interaction
between Sp1 and the responsive element of the CDK1
promoter, which indicated indirect binding of Sp1 to this
DNA region. A number of studies have demonstrated
that post-translational modifications both regulate the
intracellular compartmentalization of Sp1 and modulate
its interactions with other transcription factors. [41–43]
There are compelling data to indicate that the Sp1dependent activation and repression of target promoters
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is modulated by its interactions with a repertoire of
heterogeneous transcriptional regulators. A partial list of
Sp1-interacting proteins includes the Mediator complex,
c-Myc, Ah, Arnt, ER, AR, GATAs, p53, MEF2C,
Smad2-4, Msx1, Rb, NF-κB, NF-YA, VHL, MyoD, E2F,
NFAT-1, and YY1; [41] however, which transcriptional
regulator participated in the regulation of Sp1 in the
responsive element of the CDK1 promoter remains to be
verified.
Microarray data also indicated a PP2A independent
regulation on p21 by cantharidin and OA. Consisting with
this result, the PP2A inhibition dependent activation of
JNK had no effect on p21 expression, although the basal
activity of JNK represses p21 expression, which might
promote mitosis. [28, 44] This data suggested that in the
normal culture environment, JNK dependent repression
on p21 promoted cell growth. While in the circumstance
of treatment with PP2A inhibitors, overactivation of
JNK inhibited cell growth through repression on CDK1
(Figure 5G).
The PP2A/JNK independent repression on p21
was further proved to be related to autophagy induction.
Autophagy is a genetically programmed, evolutionarily
conserved process that degrades long-living cellular
proteins and organelles, including the endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. [45]
During autophagy the cytoplasmic constituents are
delivered to the lysosome, forming a double-membrane
vesicle, termed as autophagosome. [46] There is
an increasing interest in exploring autophagy as a
mechanism of action in cancer therapy. By now, 16
autophagy-related proteins (Atg proteins) have been
identified to participate in autophagy. [47] LC3, the
mammalian ontology of Atg8, is a credible marker
for the autophagosome. [47, 48] During formation of
autophagosomes, LC3 will form punctate structures
within the cytoplasm that correspond to autophagic
vesicles. [47]
Recent studies have explored the connection
between PP2A and autophagy. PP2A can exert both a
positive and negative effect on autophagy, depending on
the particular step on which it acts and on its composition
in subunits. [49] However, based on our present study,
specific knockdown of PP2Ac did not affect the expression
of p21. While treatment with cantharidin and OA
stimulated p21 expression through autophagy dependent
manner, suggesting the autophagy induced by cantharidin
and OA might be executed through a PP2A inhibition
independent manner.
In conclusion, our previous study had found that PP2A
inhibitors activated the JNK pathway, induced G2/M cell
cycle arrest, and inhibited growth in cancer cells. This study
suggested that the PP2A/JNK/Sp1/CDK1 cell signaling
pathway and autophagy/p21 pathway may be responsible
for the G2/M cell cycle arrest and cytotoxicity by treatment
with PP2A inhibitors in cancer cells (Figure 5G). These data

also explained the bidirectional mechanism of JNK regulation
in cell proliferation: the basal activity of JNK accelerated
proliferation through repression of p21; whereas, overactivated
JNK repressed cell growth through upregulation of CDK1.
PP2A is always considered to be a cancer
repressor. [5] Previous efforts mostly focused on upregulating PP2A to achieve an inhibition on its cancer
promoting substrate kinases. [7] So it was really
difficult to accept PP2A inhibitors in cancer treatment.
Quite on the contrary, the dried body of mylabris, from
which cantharidin is extracted, has been used as a
traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2000 years
and is still being used as a folk medicine. [1] Ancient
Chinese applied this natural product to the treatment of
cancer with the notion of “fighting fire with fire” [50]
without awareness of its molecular target, PP2A. Thus,
exploring the mechanism involved in the PP2A-inhibition
dependent cytotoxicity, may bring new lights to cancer
treatment. Our studies suggest that the PP2A/JNK
pathway locates at the crossroad of determining cell fate.
To maintain a normal cell function, the activity of PP2A/
JNK pathway must be restricted at an appropriate level,
as both repression and overactivation on this pathway
could result in growth inhibition. This phenomenon fits
well with the ‘Yin-Yang’ theory, which is an ancient
Chinese philosophy nowadays accepted around the world.
[51, 52] The principle of Yin and Yang, the balance
between opposing natural forces, has been emphasised
as a fundamental property of cellular growth regulation.
[52] Therefore, anti-cancer approaches through activation
or repression on PP2A, could both be considered as
disturbing the balance between Yin and Yang. And the
bidirectional JNK transducts this signal, resulting in cell
growth inhibition. Our investigations bring a new cancer
treatment strategy by turning a cancer-promoting kinase
into an anti-cancer kinase through inhibition of PP2A,
providing a whole new way to fight cancer.

Cantharidin, okadaic acid (OA), SP600125, and RO3306 were purchased from Enzo Life Science International
(PA, USA). 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was purchased from
Sigma (Sigma, MO, USA).

Cell cycle analysis (PI staining)
Cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide (PI)
was performed as previously described. [2] Prior to
treatment, cells were synchronized in the cell cycle by
serum starvation for 24 h. [53] After treatment, the cells
were fixed in 80% ice cold ethanol, and incubated with
0.5% Triton X-100 solution containing 1 mg/ml RNase
A at 37°C for 30 min. PI (Sigma) was added to a final
concentration of 50 μg/ml followed by 30 min incubation
in the dark. Cellular DNA content was analyzed by
a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; Becton
Dickinson, NJ, USA). Data were processed by ModFit LT
software (Verity Software House, ME, USA).

Cell cycle analysis (mithramycin A staining)
Cell cycle analysis with mithramycin A was performed
according to the protocol established by Schmidt et al. [10]
Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.1% nonidet P-40
for 5 min, followed by fixation with 1% formaldehyde.
Mithramycin A (Sigma) was added to the sample to a
final contraction of 20 mg/ml. The green fluorescence of
mithramycin A was analyzed by FACS (Becton Dickinson).

MTT assay
Cellular growth was evaluated by MTT (3-[4,
5-dimethyltiazol-2-yl] 2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide)
assay. [54] Cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture
plates at 5 × 104 cells per well. After treatment, MTT
(Sigma) was added to each well to a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml, followed by incubation at 37°C for 4 h. The
medium was then removed, and 600 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) was added per well. As the PP2A inhibitor-treated
cells became detached, the formazana in the medium was
harvested by centrifugation at 10, 000 rpm for 10 min,
dissolved in 200 μl of DMSO, and then returned to the
original well. The absorbance of total 800 μl formazana
dissolved DMSO in each well was measured at 490 nm
using a microplate ELISA reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
CA, USA). The relative cell viability was calculated
as follows: relative cell viability = (mean experimental
absorbance/mean control absorbance) × 100%.

CA, USA). Total protein was extracted using a lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, supplemented
with protease inhibitors (10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10
mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL pepstatin A, and 1 mM
4-[2-aminoethyl] benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The protein
extract was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel,
size-fractionated by electrophoresis, and then transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (BioRad Laboratories). After blocking in 5% non-fat milk
for 1 h, the membranes were incubated overnight with
primary antibodies at 4°C. The protein expression was
determined using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL, Millipore, St Charles, MO, USA) detection. The
intensity of the bands was captured by JS-1035 image
analysis scanning system (Peiqing Science & Technology,
Shanghai, China). B2M was used as the internal control.

Luciferase reporter gene plasmids
A series of deletion mutants of the human cdk1
promoter [17, 18] spanning -2994 to +24 were generated by
PCR using pairs of primers bearing specific restriction sites
(Table 1), and subcloned into KpnI and XhoI sites of the
pGL3-basic vector. The luciferase reporter plasmid, Sp1luc (1), which contains the sequence 5′-CGCGTGGGCGG
AACTGGGCGG AGTTAGGGGCGG GA-3′, consisting
of three consensus Sp1 binding sites (GGGCGG) from
the SV40 promoter, was generated by subcloning the
above fragment into the NheI and HindIII sites of the
pGL3-basic vector, according to Sowa et al. [55] A

ChIP assay

Agilent 44K human whole-genome oligonucleotide
microarrays. The selection criterion was defined as a
more than 2-fold difference in the level of expression
(difference in up-regulated expression more than 2-fold,
and difference in down-regulated expression less than
0.5-fold). Hierarchical clustering of samples was done by
average linkage algorithm using TIGR MultiExperiment
Viewer (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville,
MD, USA).

ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit
(Upstate Biotechnology, NY, USA) as previously described.
[56] Briefly, Cells (1 × 107) were fixed in medium containing
1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After cell
lysis, genomic DNA was sheared into 200–1000 bp fragments
using Sonics VCX130 (Sonics & Materials, CT, USA).
Sheared chromatin was incubated with anti-Sp1 or negative
control IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C. NaCl
was added to the ChIP samples for 4 h at 65°C to reverse
the cross-links. To purify the immunoprecipitated DNA
the following steps were performed: RNase and proteinase
K were added in order; followed by phenol-chloroform
extraction; ethanol precipitation; and resuspension of the
DNA in distilled water. The purified DNA was further
used as a template for real-time PCR detection using an
ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA). The specific primers were as
follows: forward, 5′-CCTTTACATTTTTGAGGCGGTC-3′,
reverse, 5′-CTCCCAGCATTGGCACAGTT-3′, product,
229 bp. Real-time PCR data were analyzed as previously
described. [56]

Autophagy assay using the DsRed-LC3 reporter
To develop an autophagy reporter, we fused the
LC3 (also known as ATG8) cDNA to the C terminus of
DsRed as previously described. [57] To produce stable
cell lines continuously reporting autophagy activity,
recombinant lentiviruses expressing the DsRed-LC3
reporter were generated and used to infect cells. The
LC3 puncta were visualized with an Olympus BX51
microscope (Tokyo, Japan). DNA was counterstained
using DAPI (Sigma).

Statistical analysis
Each experiment was performed a minimum of three
times. Results were expressed as the mean value ± standard
deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed by
unpaired Student’s t-test. The correlations between microarray
assays were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation
analysis. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Microarray assay
Sample preparation and processing procedure
were performed as described in detail in the Agilent
GeneChip Expression Analysis Manual (Santa Clara,
CA). Differentially expressed genes were screened using
