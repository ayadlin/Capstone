Abstract
Increased activity of SRC family kinases promotes tumor invasion and metastasis, and
overexpression of the mitotic regulator Aurora kinase A (AURKA) drives tumor aneuploidy and
chromosomal instability. These actions nominate SRC and AURKA as valuable therapeutic
targets for cancer, and inhibitors for SRC and Aurora kinases are now being employed in the
clinic. In this study, we demonstrate potent synergy between multiple inhibitors of Aurora and
SRC kinases in ovarian and colorectal cancer cell lines, but not in normal ovarian epithelial cell
lines. Combination of Aurora and SRC inhibitors selectively killed cells that have undergone a
preceding aberrant mitosis, and was associated with a post-mitotic reattachment defect, and
selective removal of aneuploid cell populations. Combined inhibition of Aurora kinase and SRC
potentiated dasatinib-dependent loss of activated (Y416-phosphorylated) SRC. SRC and AURKA
share a common interaction partner, NEDD9, which serves as a scaffolding protein with activities
in cell attachment and mitotic control, suggesting SRC and AURKA might interact directly. In
vitro, we observed physical interaction and mutual cross-phosphorylation between SRC and
AURKA that enhanced SRC kinase activity. Together, these findings suggest that combination of
SRC and Aurora-targeting inhibitors in the clinic may be a productive strategy.

Introduction
Substantial effort has been devoted to the creation of protein-targeted biological therapeutics
intended to prevent the growth and metastasis of tumor cells (Cao and Liu, 2007; Pfeiffer et
al., 2007). However, pre-clinical testing and early phase trials have generally indicated that
few of these agents employed as monotherapies have produced strong gains in blocking
tumor growth (Brandsma and van den Bent, 2007; Wong and Goodin, 2009). An emerging
strategy in overcoming resistance is the identification of novel combination therapies
involving targeted agents, as these often have enhanced clinical efficacy (Bagnyukova et
al.). We now describe a novel strategy involving the combination of inhibitors of SRC and
Aurora kinases.

The tyrosine kinase SRC regulates cell proliferation, survival, cytoskeleton, cell-cell
contacts, and cell-matrix attachments at focal adhesions (Guarino, 2010; Yeatman, 2004). At
focal adhesions, SRC forms an activated complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
scaffolding proteins such as NEDD9 (Yeatman, 2004) to regulate focal adhesion turnover,
stimulating downstream effector pathways that reorganize the cytoskeleton during
migration. SRC also becomes hyperactive at the G2/M transition, and phosphorylates
substrates that promote focal adhesion disassembly and facilitate the cell rounding
phenotype characteristic of mitosis (Mustelin and Hunter, 2002). SRC is overexpressed in a
large percentage of human tumors including colorectal, breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreas,
lung carcinoma, glioma, melanoma, head and neck, and different types of sarcoma (Guarino,
2010; Shor et al., 2007). Interestingly, SRC is only rarely mutated in tumors, suggesting
aberrant interactions with partner proteins may contribute to its increased activity. Activated
SRC supports tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (Yeatman, 2004).

Aurora serine/threonine kinases (Aurora-A/AURKA, Aurora-B/AURKB, and Aurora-C/
AURKC) are best known for roles in M-phase (Gautschi et al., 2008; Keen and Taylor,
2004), although recent publications have begun to identify roles for AURKA in interphase
cells (Plotnikova and Golemis, 2011; Plotnikova et al., 2010; Pugacheva et al., 2007).
AURKA is best known for regulating mitotic entry and progression, influencing centrosome
maturation and separation, bipolar-spindle assembly, chromosomal alignment on the
metaphase plate and cytokinesis (Dutertre et al., 2002; Glover et al., 1995). As with SRC,
AURKA protein overexpression often occurs in ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, liver,
bladder and gastric cancers, and is generally associated with genomic instability and
aneuploidy, a higher tumor grade and a poor prognosis (Bischoff et al., 1998; Giet et al.,
2005). Exogenous overexpression of AURKA either in vitro or in vivo transforms rodent
fibroblast cells and induces tetraploidization, failed cytokinesis, and genomic instability.
Overexpressed AURKA also affects the DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint, and the
mitotic spindle checkpoint (Anand et al., 2003). AURKB is rarely overexpressed in tumors,
but plays important roles in regulating kinetochore and chromasome segregation in mitosis
(Ditchfield et al., 2003). In contrast, AURKC has limited expression, and has primarily been
studied in the context of meiotic cell division and early development (Fernandez-Miranda et
al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several lines of evidence suggested the possibility of functional or direct physical
interactions for SRC and AURKA. Both proteins interact with a common partner, NEDD9,
with these interactions contributing to activation of each kinase (Minegishi et al., 1996;
Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005; Pugacheva et al., 2007). Besides its role in mitosis, AURKA
activity has recently been identified as regulating cell migration, similar to NEDD9 and SRC
(Guan et al., 2007). An emerging paradigm for the design of combinatorial therapies takes
as its model synthetic lethal analyses from lower organisms. These studies have established
that dual inhibition of proteins operating together or in parallel pathways is often particularly
effective in reducing signaling function, to potential therapeutic gain (Friedman and
Perrimon, 2007). With this goal, we have here assessed the consequences of dual inhibition
of Aurora kinases and SRC. We here report that multiple SRC and Aurora inhibitors
synergize strongly to promote cell killing in cancer cell lines. This cell killing is associated
with a post-mitotic attachment defect, clearance of aneuploid cell populations, and
hypoactive SRC. We also establish that SRC and AURKA directly associate and
phosphorylate each other in vitro, supporting the idea of direct interaction. These and other
findings provide an initial justification for combining SRC and Aurora inhibitors in the
clinic.

Consistent synergy between inhibitors of SRC and Aurora kinases in transformed but not
normal cell lines
Dasatinib is selective for SRC family kinases (SRC, YES, LCK) and BCR-ABL, with
activity at higher concentrations as an inhibitor of PDGFRβ, c-KIT, and p38 (Lombardo et
al., 2004). We initially assessed the combination of dasatinib, and the Aurora kinase
inhibitor PHA-680632 (Soncini et al., 2006) in limiting cell growth of a panel of human
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines (Figure 1A, Supplemental Table 1), and normal
primary human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells (Figure 1B). Chou-Talalay analysis
of results indicated that at multiple different drug combination ratios, dasatinib and
PHA-680632 synergized to restrict the growth of 8/8 EOC cell lines, but 0/3 HOSE cell
lines. Similar synergy was obtained using either of two alternative small molecule inhibitors
of Aurora kinases (MLN8237 or C1368, both preferentially inhibiting AURKA) in
combination with dasatinib, or an alternative small molecule inhibitor of SRC kinases (PP2)
in combination with PHA-680632 (Figure 1C). Potent synergy was also observed in 3/3
colorectal cancer cell lines, including the RAS-mutated DLD1 cell line and its RAS wildtype isogenic counterpart, DKS8 (Figure 1C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As separate measures of efficacy of the dasatinib-PHA630632 combination, we performed
clonogenic assays (Figures 2A, 2B) and assessed colony formation on Matrigel (Figures 2C,
2D). By both measures, treatment of cells with the combination resulted in significantly
reduced colony size and total number of colonies versus treatment with either single agent at
the same dose. Further, cells within Matrigel colonies treated with the drug combination
were much more positive for cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 2E), indicating the occurrence of
apoptotic cell death, rather than solely cytostasis.
Dual inhibition of Aurora and SRC kinases selectively reduces accumulation of aneuploid
cells associated with Aurora inhibition

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To begin to explore the molecular basis for the strong synergy in growth inhibition, we
investigated the consequences of combining dasatinib and PHA-680632 on cell cycle
progression (Figure 3A). Treatment of thymidine-synchronized OVCAR10 cells with
dasatinib caused G1 accumulation (57% ± 11% of total cells versus 45% ± 3% for vehicle
treated cells) within 24 hours. Treatment with PHA-680632 caused accumulation of cells in
the 4N (G2/M) compartment (38% ± 6% of total cells versus 32% ± 2% for vehicle treated
cells), and also led to the appearance of a significant >4N cell population (30% ± 4% of total
cells versus 5% ± 2% for vehicle treated cells). Treatment with the dasatinib/PHA-680632
combination resembled treatment with PHA-680632, but further increased the proportion of
4N cells (to 46% ± 8%) versus PHA-680632 alone. Intriguingly, the combination
significantly and selectively reduced the hyperploid >4N population at 19 and 24 hours
relative to PHA-680632 treatment alone (to 7% ± 2% and 11% ± 2%, respectively, versus
18% ± 2% and 30% ± 4%; P = 0.0048 and 0.0015). Similar results were obtained in a
second cell line, PEO-1 (Supplementary Figure S1), but were not observed in HOSE cells
treated with the same concentrations of drugs (Figure 3B). Further, although a >4N
hyperploid population was induced by treatment of cells with inhibitors selective for
AURKA (MLN8257) or AURKB (AZD1152), only the combination of dasatinib with
MLN8257 selectively reduced this population of cells (Figure 3C), suggesting a specific
interaction between dasatinib targets and AURKA.
The FACS results suggested that the drug combination-induced lethality specifically
involves mitotic progression. To better address mitotic progression following drug
treatment, live cell imaging was used to characterize in detail the progression through

mitosis of thymidine-synchronized (S-phase arrested) OVCAR10 cells that stably expressed
GFP fused to histone H2B, to allow visualization of nuclei and chromosomes. Drugs were
added 3 hours after removal of thymidine. The time required for entry to mitosis, measured
as chromosomal condensation, was equivalent among the treatment groups (5.28 ± 1.68 hrs
for vehicle, 5.49 ± 1.52 hrs for PHA-680632, 4.63 ± 2.10 hrs for dasatinib, and 5.42 ± 1.67
hrs for the dasatinib/PHA-680632 combination) (Figure 3D). PHA-680632 treatment
slightly decreased the percent of cells entering mitosis, but this effect was eliminated when
cells were treated with the drug combination (Figure 3E). Treatment of cells with
PHA-680632 increased the overall duration of mitosis (from 93.6 to 139.4 minutes), which
was similar to the delay seen in cells treated with PHA-680632 plus dasatinib (149.2
minutes) (Figure 3F). PHA-680632 treatment induced a high frequency of cells that
underwent aberrant mitosis with cleavage furrow regression to produce a binucleate single
progeny (Figure 3G, Supplementary Figure S2), but this frequency was not further enhanced
by addition of dasatinib. A marked increase in cells undergoing abrupt condensation and
fragmentation of chromosomal material, to produce the pyknotic nuclei typically associated
with apoptotic cells, was evident in live cell imaging of combination-treated cells (Figure
3H, I).
Dual inhibition of Aurora and SRC kinases selectively kills cells that have undergone
defective mitoses and failed to reattach

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The preceding results might indicate the drug combination increased the killing of the postmitotic, hyperploid cells, or caused death during mitosis of cells that would otherwise be
destined to become hyperploid. To discriminate between these possibilities, we performed a
subgroup analysis of cells that underwent cell death, as defined by nuclear fragmentation
and cellular condensation, in live cell imaging experiments focusing on GFP-H2B, to
visualize chromatin. We followed the fate of individual cells for up to 48 hours following
release from thymidine block, and categorized cell death as 1) death without mitotic entry,
2) death in mitosis, 3) death of one or both daughter cells produced from an apparently
normal mitosis, and 4) death of a multinuclear daughter cell produced after an aberrant
mitosis (Supplementary Figure S2). Compared to vehicle or the individual drug treatments,
the majority of cell deaths following treatment with the combination of PHA-680632 and
dasatinib treatment followed an aberrant mitosis (72.3% ± 6.3 for the combination versus
46.2% ± 19.6 for PHA-680632 (P < 0.0001), 9.5% ± 8.2 for vehicle, and 5.6% ± 9.6% for
dasatinib) (Figure 4A). However, death was not an immediate consequence of mitosis, but
occurred typically 10–13 hours later, with no difference in timing between treatment groups
(Supplementary Figure S3A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The SRC family kinases targeted by dasatinib are important for both cell attachment and
control of mitotic cell rounding (Mustelin and Hunter, 2002; Yeatman, 2004). We evaluated
the bright field images from the live cell imaging experiment and stratified the cells that
underwent cell death as follows: 1) attached cells that did not undergo mitotic division, 2)
cells that lost attachment and did not undergo division, 3) cells that entered mitosis with
normal post-mitotic reattachment, and 4) cells that entered mitosis but displayed postmitotic reattachment failure (Supplementary Figure S2). Strikingly, a large percentage of
cells treated with PHA-680632 plus dasatinib that died failed to re-spread after mitosis, a
death phenotype not significantly represented with either vehicle or individual drug treated
cells (Figure 4B). The latency between initial cell rounding for mitosis and cell death was
similar among all the treatment groups (Supplementary Figure S3B); rather, the drug
combination selectively increased the percentage of the cell population undergoing this fate.
These data implied that the interaction between PHA-680632 and dasatinib depended on
disruption of cell attachment. To test this idea, we compared the efficacy of this drug
combination in adherent cells, versus cells growing in detached conditions. We found that

cell death was not significantly elevated in suspension cells treated with the drug
combination versus either alone (Figure 4C), supporting the interpretation that disruption of
adhesive signals was an important component of the drug interaction.
Functional and direct interactions between SRC and AURKA
We next assessed whether AURKA and SRC directly or functionally interact, so that
inhibition of one might depress activation of the other, contributing to the observed synergy
in growth inhibition. We determined that treatment of cells with dasatinib did not inhibit
AURKA activity in OVCAR10 cells (Figure 5A). Reciprocally, PHA-680632 has no effect
on SRC activity at the highest concentrations used in this study (Figure 5B, C). However,
PHA-680632 significantly potentiated dasatinib in blocking SRC activation, as gauged by
either Western blot (Figure 5B) or immunofluorescence assays (Supplementary Figure S4).
In further analysis, we found that SRC and AURKA co-immunoprecipitated following coexpression of tagged constructs (Figure 5C). This interaction was similar to the levels seen
with positive control NEDD9, supporting the idea of a potential interaction; however, to date
we have not observed co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous SRC and AURKA.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further probe AURKA and SRC interactions, we next performed an in vitro kinase assay
with the two kinases (Figure 5D). The auto-phosphorylation seen with recombinant SRC
alone and recombinant AURKA alone is blocked by dasatinib and PHA-680632,
respectively. When SRC and AURKA are combined in the same kinase reaction, we detect a
very large increase in phosphorylation of both SRC and AURKA, an effect that is only
partially blocked by either PHA-680632 or dasatinib treatment. Interestingly, combination
of SRC and AURKA induced significant phospho-tyrosine staining on AURKA (Figure
5D), indicative of SRC substrate specificity. In contrast, combination of SRC and AURKB
did not increase in auto-phophosphorylation by SRC, and SRC did not tyrosinephosphorylate AURKB, while only weakly inducing AURKB auto-phosphorylation (Figure
5E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further probe the specificity of SRC and Aurora kinase interactions, we examined
induction of apoptosis in cells treated with dasatinib plus siRNAs targeting AURKA versus
AURKB, or with PHA-680632 plus siRNA targeting SRC (Figure 5F). Depletion of
AURKA and AURKB independently increased PARP and caspase-3 cleavage in
conjunction with dasatinib. Although a greater absolute magnitude of PARP induction was
observed with AURKB, this was on a background in which siRNA to AURKB itself
significantly induced PARP: in contrast, siRNA to AURKA only induced apoptotic
signaling when combined with dasatinib. Interestingly, in the context of dasatinib treatment,
siRNA depletion of AURKB led to cross-depletion of AURKA, and inhibition of AURKA
cross-depleted AURKB, again suggesting dialog between the dasatinib targets and these
proteins. SiRNA to SRC in combination with PHA-680632 also led to greater co-induction
of PARP, although not to the same extent as with the siAurora/dasatinib combinations. The
lesser effect may be due to the presence of multiple other SRC family members, such as
LYN, YES, and FYN, in ovarian cancer cells, which would be inhibited by dasatinib but not
an siRNA; or by inhibition of an alternative dasatinib target.

Discussion
We have here described a novel in vitro synergy between dasatinib and inhibitors of Aurora
kinases in ovarian and colorectal cancer cell lines, but not in normal ovarian epithelial cells,
and we have shown that multiple drugs that inhibit SRC family kinases and Aurora kinases
have similar phenotypes. Treatment of cells with combined AURKA inhibitors and dasatinib
resulted in a specific elimination of aneuploid cells after they have undergone defective
mitosis and failed to reattach to substrate. SRC and AURKA directly interacted in vitro, and

Both dasatinib and Aurora inhibitors are showing promise in the clinic for treatment of some
malignancies. For example, in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), dasatinib treatment has
resulted in high rates of complete cytogenic response, where tumor cells are no longer
detected in the blood of patients, both after failure of imatinib treatment (Hochhaus et al.,
2008) and as a first line treatment (Kantarjian et al., 2010), based on the activity of this
compound against BCR-ABL. Phase I data showed that treatment with the pan-Aurora
inhibitor PHA-739358 resulted in clinically relevant disease stabilization in some patients,
and a phase II study recently demonstrated that complete hematologic response can be
reached in two of twelve patients with CML (Boss et al., 2009). Our data support the
combined use of such compounds may be worth exploring in the clinic. Interestingly, Fei
and colleagues (Fei et al., 2010) reported that combined treatment of Philadelphia
chromosome-positive human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with a combination
of the pan-Aurora inhibitor VX-680 and dasatinib resulted in a significant increase in
cytotoxicity compared to the individual drugs alone. Since VX-680 also has been shown to
inhibit the BCR-ABL oncogene based on off-target activity (Carter et al., 2005), the authors
attribute synergy to potent inhibition of this oncogenic fusion protein. Our data suggest that
inhibition of Aurora kinases and SRC may also contribute, particularly as Fei et al. noted a
more significant reduction in phospho-SRC when ALL cells were treated with a
combination of dasatinib and VX-680 as compared to the individual agents (Fei et al.,
2010), although they did not pursue this observation. It will be informative to assess whether
VX-680/dasatinib synergy is observed in solid tumors in which BCR-ABL is not a driving
lesion. Interestingly, in previous work, we found dual inhibition of AURKA and the receptor
tyrosine kinase EGFR significantly and selectively reduced the activity of SRC and other
SRC-family kinases (FGR, HCK, LYN and LCK) (Astsaturov et al., 2010), further implying
close signaling interactions between AURKA, SRC, and another important therapeutic
target.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The idea of dually targeting SRC and Aurora inhibitors has potentially greater impact than
suggesting new applications for dasatinib. Multiple SRC inhibitors are currently undergoing
clinical trials. These include not only the ATP-binding site competitive inhibitors such as
dasatinib and AZD0530, but also substrate-binding site inhibitors such as KXOI (Guarino,
2010; Kopetz et al., 2007). There have been some clinical successes with these agents.
However, despite their promise, SRC inhibitors used as single agents in preclinical models
and phase I trials have been shown to only affect proliferation in a very limited number of
cases (Johnson et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2002), and do not effectively induce tumor
regression based on radiographic analysis (Kopetz et al., 2007). It would be of interest to
also evaluate these for interaction with Aurora inhibitors.
Mechanistically, the death phenotype of dually treated cells indicates a failure to re-adhere
after prior defects in completion of mitosis is an important component of the resulting
apoptosis. There are many links between cellular attachment and cell division. Defective
cellular attachment results in multinucleation, and inhibition of cytokinesis in part because
of failure of cells to generate adequate traction forces to drive separation (Ben-Ze’ev and
Raz, 1981; Huang et al., 2005; Orly and Sato, 1979). AURKA and SRC have each
separately been shown to influence the completion of cytokinesis. SRC localized to plasma
membrane subdomains at the cleavage furrow becomes hyper-phosphorylated at cytokinesis,
with SRC activation supporting cleavage furrow progression (Ng et al., 2005) and
abscission (Kasahara et al., 2007). Likewise, microinjection of antibodies to inhibit AURKA
at metaphase was shown to prevent cytokinesis completion (Marumoto et al., 2003).
NEDD9, a physical interactor of both SRC and AURKA, relocalizes from focal adhesion

complexes to the spindle asters during mitosis, and misexpression of NEDD9 leads to
cytokinesis failure (Dadke et al., 2006; Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005). Loss of adhesion is
ultimately associated with anoikis in epithelial cells (Frisch and Screaton, 2001), due to loss
of survival signals mediated through integrins. Our data are compatible with the idea that
given the close interaction of AURKA, SRC, and NEDD9, inhibition of two of these
proteins simultaneously may exacerbate defects in both the cell division and cell survival
processes they mediate.

remaining antibodies used in Western blot experiments (to phospho-Y416 Src, Src, phosphoT288 Aurora-A, pan-phospho Aurora [recognizing phosphorylation on AURKA-T288/
AURKB-T232/AURKC-T198], and β-actin), cleaved caspase 3 (D175) were purchased from
Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA). Phospho-Y416 Src antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and Alexa-Fluor anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used for immunofluorescence.
In vitro kinase assays
In vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant active Aurora A (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), recombinant Hexa-histidine baculovirus-produced Aurora A,
recombinant active Aurora B (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), or recombinant active Src
kinase (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Bacterially expressed GST-fused NEDD91–363

(produced in BL21 bacteria, as described in (Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005)) and GST
protein were added to reactions as indicated. For drug inhibition experiments, recombinant
proteins were pretreated with drugs on ice for 20 minutes before the start of the kinase
reaction. In vitro kinase reaction was performed with γ-32P-ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham,
MA, USA) as in (Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005). All assays were done a minimum of 3
times and a representative blot shown in experiments.
Clonogenic and Matrigel assays
For clonogenic assays, cells were plated at concentration of 1000 cells per 35mm dish, and
after 24 hours treated with vehicle (DMSO) PHA-680632, dasatinib or drug combination for
24 hours. Subsequently, cells were cultured in fresh media without drugs for 10 to 12 days.
Colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS, and stained with 0.4% crystal
violet/20% methanol. Colonies larger than 10 pixels in diameter (typically ~8 cells) were
counted with Metamorph software. For 3D matrigel assays, 5 × 103 OVCAR10 cells were
added to 40 μl of growth factor reduced Matrigel in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc,
Rochester, NY). After 4 days, drugs were added in fresh medium, and cell maintained for 8
days before fixation in 4% PFA, followed by immunofluorescence or staining with crystal
violet.
Statistical methods

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A Chi-square test was used to compare cell counts for different phenotypic categories
among the four drug treatment types in time-lapse microscopy experiments. The Chi-square
test was also used to test the type of cell division that was induced by drug treatments. The
time of entry into mitosis was compared across the treatment types via the log-rank test. The
duration of mitosis was compared across the treatment types via the non-parametric
Wilcoxon test. Overall equality of several proportions for fraction of cell deaths and types of
cell deaths over the drug treatment groups were submitted to permutation tests. FACS data
was analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Clonogenic survival and matrigel assay
data were analyzed using a one-tailed Student’s t-test.

Figure 1. Consistent and strong synergy between inhibitors of SRC and Aurora kinases in
transformed but not normal cell lines

A. Synergy between PHA-680632 (PHA) and dasatinib (DAS) was tested by CellTiter Blue
assay in 8 ovarian cancer cell lines and viability curves for 5 representative cell lines were
displayed (refer to Supplementary Table 1 for a complete list of cell lines tested). B.
Synergy between PHA-680632 and dasatinib was tested in 3 normal primary human ovarian
surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines, and viability curves for the individual drugs or the drug
combination were plotted. C. A Coefficient of Interaction (CI) value of >1 indicates
antagonism; CI = 1 indicates additive effects; CI of <0.9 indicates synergy; and CI of <0.5
indicates strong synergy. CI values for combinations of Aurora (PHA-680632, MLN8237,

Figure 5. Physical and functional interaction of SRC and AURKA kinase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A. Dasatinib inhibits SRC in a dose dependent manner but does not have any effects on
nocodazole-induced activation of AURKA or AURKB. AURKA was pre-activated as in
(Kaestner et al., 2009), then cells were either unsynchronized or synchronized with 300 nM
nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 12 hours and then treated with
increasing doses of dasatinib for 3 hours. B. Western blot of whole cell lysates from
OVCAR10 cells treated for 4 hours with vehicle (DMSO), 500 nM PHA-680632, 20 or 40
nM dasatinib or the combination of PHA-680632 with dasatinib. C. Overexpressed FLAGSRC interacts with overexpressed AURKA. Cell lysates from HEK-293T cells transfected
with constructs overexpressing the indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated with
AURKA-conjugated agarose beads, and probed by western blot. D. In vitro kinase assay
with recombinant SRC and AURKA, with phosphorylation visualized by autoradiography
with γ-32P-ATP, then reprobed with phosphosite-directed antibodies as indicated. For this
and panel F, drugs were added 20 minutes before initiation of assay by addition of ATP. 500
nM dasatinib and 1000 nM PHA-680632 were used in these experiments. E. In vitro kinase
assay with recombinant purified SRC, AURKA, and AURKB as indicated. 500 nM
dasatinib and 500 nM PHA-680632 were used in these experiments. Visualization of
phosphorylation as in D. F. Cells were treated with siRNA to deplete SRC (S), AURKA (A),
or AURKB (B), or with scrambled control siRNA (−), in combination with vehicle,
dasatinib, or PHA-680632, as indicated. Representative Western blot indicates degree of
depletion, and appearance of cleaved PARP or caspase 3 as indications of apoptosis.
