BACKGROUND: Medicare Part D was designed to reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for Medicare beneficiaries, but to the authors’
knowledge the extent to which this occurred for patients with cancer has not been measured to date. The objective of the current
study was to examine the impact of Medicare Part D eligibility on OOP cost for prescription drugs and use of medical services among
patients with cancer. METHODS: Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the years 2002 through 2010, a differencesin-differences analysis estimated the effects of Medicare Part D eligibility on OOP pharmaceutical costs and medical use. The authors
compared per capita OOP cost and use between Medicare beneficiaries (aged 65 years) with cancer to near-elderly patients aged
55 years to 64 years with cancer. Statistical weights were used to generate nationally representative estimates. RESULTS: A total of
1878 near-elderly and 4729 individuals with Medicare were included (total of 6607 individuals). The mean OOP pharmaceutical cost
for Medicare beneficiaries before the enactment of Part D was $1158 (standard error, 6$52) and decreased to $501 (standard error,
6$30), a decline of 43%. Compared with changes in OOP pharmaceutical costs for nonelderly patients with cancer over the same period, the implementation of Medicare Part D was associated with a further reduction of $356 per person. Medicare Part D appeared
to have no significant impact on the use of medications, hospitalizations, or emergency department visits, but was associated with a
reduction of 1.55 in outpatient visits. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare D has reduced OOP prescription drug costs and outpatient visits for
seniors with cancer beyond trends observed for younger patients, with no major impact on the use of other medical services noted.

INTRODUCTION
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, enacted in 2003, was the largest overhaul of
Medicare in its history. The Act’s most important provision was the introduction of Medicare Part D on January 1, 2006,
which provided outpatient prescription drug benefits to 43 million Medicare beneficiaries for the first time.1 Studies have
shown that Part D decreased out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for medications,2-5 with no significant impact on the use of medical services2 for patients without cancer. The impact of Medicare Part D on patients with cancer specifically is less clear.
Over the last decade, significant strides have been made in the advancement of cancer care that have impacted
patients. With improved early detection and prevention in association with more personalized therapies, many types of
cancer have decreasing cancer-specific mortality.6 These advances, along with overall trends in health care spending, have
created a high price tag for oncologic care. In an analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data,
the national cost of cancer care in 2010 was $124 billion and is projected to rise to $157 billion in 2020, a 27% increase.7
In 2010, the United States spent approximately 18% (>$2.7 trillion) of the gross domestic product on health care, with
cancer care accounting for 5% of health care spending.8 In addition to overall rising costs, trends in the increased use of
oral chemotherapy and supportive medications are changing how cancer care is traditionally financed.
For patients, the effects of cost-sharing can lead to the inability to afford basic needs,9-11 nonadherence with medications,9,10 and bankruptcy.9,12 Financial burdens are high even for those with insurance, but are especially challenging for
at-risk populations.11,13-16

Medicare Part D Impact on Drug and Medical Use/Kircher et al

In the current study, we sought to evaluate the overall policy impact of Medicare Part D on Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of cancer using detailed health care
use and expenditure data from a large, nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data

The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)17 is sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
and the National Center for Health Statistics. The MEPS
provides annual estimates of health care use, cost, payment
sources, health insurance coverage, health status, and sociodemographic characteristics for the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The MEPS uses an overlapping
panel design and surveys are collected through personal
interviewing for a series of 5 rounds over 30 months. Each
annual MEPS sample is approximately 15,000 households.
At the time of completion of the interview portion of the
MEPS and after permission is obtained from all the participants, the medical providers, facilities, and pharmacies are
directly contacted by telephone to obtain information that
respondents cannot accurately provide. For example, in the
pharmacy component, accurate medication names and
doses, quantities dispensed, and sources and amounts of
payments were obtained directly from pharmacies. We
used data pooled from the years 2002 through 2005 and
2007 through 2010.
We defined our cohort as noninstitutionalized individuals aged 65 years with data collected in all rounds.
To avoid estimating the potential combined effect of
other programs, we excluded those individuals concurrently enrolled in TRICARE, the Veterans Affairs program, or Medicaid.
An ideal group for a control group would be those
covered by Medicare but without access to Part D benefits, but this group does not exist. Therefore, we used a
near-elderly cohort as the control group due to their similarities with Medicare beneficiaries, as shown in other
studies.2,5,18,19 Similar to these studies, we restricted this
group to those aged 55 years to 63 years. Individuals aged
64 years were excluded to avoid those who were partially
eligible for Medicare Part D and those aged <55 years
were excluded to avoid medication variation caused by the
use of medications for reproduction and contraception.20
In both the cohort and control groups, we limited
our analysis to those with “cancer” coded in the condition
file of the MEPS database. A condition of cancer can be
added to an individual in several ways. Cancer is considCancer

November 1, 2014

ered a priority condition within the MEPS and therefore
all participants in the survey are asked specifically if they
have been diagnosed with cancer. A condition of cancer
will also be added if the respondent reports cancer as a reason for a medical encounter or disability day.
Each medication was associated with a condition in
the MEPS. The medication information (name, dose,
quantity dispensed, and expenditure) is collected by surveyors during each interview and then confirmed with
pharmacy data to obtain complete and accurate data. The
association between a medication and condition is made
in 2 ways: either by self-report from the interviews or by
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9) code when the medication is verified with pharmacy data. When obtained through self-report, the associated condition is converted into an ICD-9 code by the
MEPS coders. Each medication was further categorized as
“cancer-related” or “noncancer-related” based on the association of the medication with an ICD-9 code for a cancer
diagnosis. Within the “cancer-related” medications, they
were further categorized based on the class of drug with
the following categories: antineoplastic, central nervous
system agents, topical, hormonal, cardiovascular agents,
antiinfectives, gastrointestinal, respiratory, nutritional,
metabolic agents, psychotherapeutics, genitourinary
agents, coagulation, biologic agents, or miscellaneous/not
otherwise categorized. These therapeutic classifications
were designated by MEPS coders and are based on Lexicon Plus designations (Cerner Multum Inc, Denver,
Colo).21 Due to the concern for making an incorrect association between a medication and a cancer diagnosis, we
took a random sample of 100 individuals and manually
inspected the names of the medications and the condition
with which they were associated.
Statistical Analysis

There were 2 pooled time periods: 2002 to 2005 and
2007 to 2010. These years were chosen because Medicare
Part D was enacted in 2006 and these years allow a
“before” and “after” time period for comparison. A sensitivity analysis including 2011 data in the post-Part D time
period was performed as these data became available. All
dollar amounts were adjusted to 2010 dollars based on the
Consumer Price Index. Expenditures in this study refer to
what is paid for health care services rather than charges.
The rationale for using this definition is that charges can
be a less approximate proxy for medical expenditures
when there is significant discounting.
The primary dependent variables included OOP
costs, medication use, hospitalizations, emergency

department visits, and outpatient visits. OOP costs are
defined as direct payment for all prescription drugs by
patients who reported having cancer as a condition. The
number of new prescriptions and refills per person were
used as measurements of prescription drug use during one
year. Emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and
inpatient hospitalizations were measured by the annual
number of visits. For inpatient hospitalizations, the number of discharges included those hospitalizations for which
the admission and discharge date were the same. In addition, we evaluated the total prescription drug costs that
included both the payer and OOP costs.
Independent 2-group Student t tests were conducted
for continuous variables and the chi-square test was used
for categorical variables to compare the treatment and
control groups at baseline in terms of age, sex, ethnicity,
region, marital status, type of insurance coverage, poverty
category, and number of comorbidities.
We used a differences-in-differences model to estimate the impact of Medicare Part D on each of our outcome variables.22 A differences-in-differences model
assumes that, in the absence of the treatment or in our
case Medicare Part D, the average outcomes for the
exposed and control groups would have followed parallel
paths over time. This methodology has been used previously in studies evaluating intervention programs or policies.23-26 A multivariate differences-in-differences model
is written as:
Outcome 5B01B1 group 1B2 year
1B3 ðgroup 3year Þ1other covariates
in which “group” is the variable for the treatment and
control groups and B1 is the coefficient that reflects the
differences between the control and treatment groups.
The variable “year” indicates whether the time period is
before or after enactment of Medicare Part D, with B2 the
coefficient demonstrating the change in outcomes in the
absence of Medicare Part D and solely due to time trends.
The output of interest for the current analysis was B3,
which is an interaction term and measures the effect of the
intervention on the treatment group.
Expenditure data regarding OOP and total costs are
highly skewed and zero inflated.27,28 To deal with these
nonnormal distributions, we used a flexible 2-part model
to accommodate both excess zeroes and skewed distribution of the nonzero values.27 These data have been
referred to as “semicontinuous” in the literature and can
be viewed as arising from 2 distinct stochastic process, one
of which governs the occurrences of zeroes and the second
3380

of which determines the observed values given a nonzero
response.29 This 2-part mixture model is an ideal choice
for these data to accommodate both data-generating processes. A logit model was used for the first part and a generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link and gamma
distribution was used in the second part.30 We used a
modified Park test to determine the distribution family
for the GLM. We reported the standard errors (SEs) and
P values of the interaction term of the GLM that represents individuals who had nonzero expenditures.
For the use variables (number of prescription drugs
with refills, number of emergency department visits,
number of outpatient visits, and number of hospitalizations), a zero-inflated negative binomial (zinb) was used.
We used zinb regression, as opposed to the zero-inflated
Poisson regression, because there was data dispersion in
our outcome variables.31 The zinb model arises from a
theory that suggests that a separate process governs the
excess zeroes versus the count values and they can be modeled independently. Therefore, the zinb model has 2 parts:
a negative binomial count model and a logit model to predict excess zeroes. We reported the SEs and P values of the
interaction term of the negative binomial regression that
represents individuals who had nonzero use for each
variable.
To analyze the category and drug class associated
with each medication, we tabulated the percentage of
medications that were “cancer-associated” with
“noncancer-associated” medications. Within the cancerassociated medications, we further tabulated the portion
from each drug class. This analysis was performed by
pooling data from 2002 through 2010 and examining the
Medicare group.
All the current analyses accounted for a MEPS complex sampling design and sampling weights were applied
accordingly. Data were analyzed with Stata statistical software (version 13; StataCorp, College Station, Tex)

RESULTS
Sample and Baseline Characteristics

The data set included 8134 total individuals aged 55
years with cancer coded in the condition file in MEPS
years 2002 through 2005 and 2007 through 2010. Of
Medicare beneficiaries, there were 5742 individuals with
cancer as a condition and 1013 were excluded due to dual
Medicaid or TRICARE insurance. This resulted in 4729
individuals in the final analysis, which represents over 59
million Medicare beneficiaries. In the control group of
near-elderly individuals, there were 2391 individuals with

resulted in 1878 individuals between the ages of 55 and
64 years, which represents >23 million near-elderly.
Table 1 examines the demographic characteristics of
the 2 groups. The average age of the Medicare beneficiaries was 75.3 years and the control group had a mean age
of 59.1 years. Medicare beneficiaries tended to have more
comorbidities (3.72 vs 2.89; P<.01), were less likely to be
married (62% vs 74%; P<.01), and to have lower
incomes (17% vs 6% in the low-income category). There
were fewer females in the Medicare group (46% vs 53%;
P<.01) and no significant differences with regard to ethnicity or region was noted within the 2 groups. Prescription drug coverage increased among individuals with
Medicare from before Part D enactment (41%) to after
(67.5%). In contrast, prescription drug coverage among
the near-elderly remained stable before versus after Part D
enactment (83.7% vs 81.1%).
Table 2 shows the adjusted differences-indifferences results for the outcomes of interest. The covariates included sex, age, year, region, number of comorbidities, and poverty status. Compared with changes in
OOP medication costs for nonelderly patients with cancer
Cancer

over the same period, the implementation of Medicare
Part D was associated with a further reduction of $356
(P 5 .02) per person with cancer. We did not observe a
significant impact of Medicare Part D on medication use
(P 5 .79), emergency department visits (P 5 .85), or hospital use (P 5 .68). There was a significant decrease in the
number of total outpatient visits per year with implementation of Medicare Part D (1.55 decrease in the total number of outpatient visits; P 5 .05). In both the Medicare
and near-elderly group, the OOP cost for prescription
drugs decreased. In the Medicare group, OOP costs
decreased from $1158 (6$52) to $501 (6$30), a
decrease of $473. In the near-elderly group, OOP costs
also decreased from $789 (6 $67) to $645 (6 $49). In a
sensitivity analysis to evaluate more recent trends, we
included 2011 data and therefore the time period after
Medicare Part D enactment was from 2007 through
2011. When 2011 data were included, the implementation of Medicare Part D was associated with a further
reduction in OOP costs of $419 compared with the nearelderly group.
To evaluate the percentage of total prescription
drugs that were associated with cancer, we combined all
Medicare individuals from 2002 through 2010. We

randomly sampled 100 individuals to check face validity
of the association between medication and associated diagnosis and we believed that there were appropriate associations coded. Of the total Medicare group in all years,
21% of the individuals had at least 1 medication that was
specifically associated with cancer treatment. There were a
total of 1068 individuals who had at least 1 cancerassociated medication, representing >12 million of the
59 million Medicare-eligible individuals with a cancer
3382

diagnosis. Of the total number of cancer-associated medications, the most common drug classes were antineoplastics (21.2%), central nervous system agents (18.1%),
topical agents (13.4%), hormones (9.8%), and cardiovascular agents (9.6%) (Table 3). Of those individuals with
at least 1 cancer-associated medication, 31.5% of the total
medications were associated with cancer. Of all Medicareeligible individuals, 6.9% of total medications were associated with cancer.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the impact
of Medicare Part D among individuals with a cancer diagnosis. In this analysis of the MEPS, it was found that
Medicare Part D eligibility was associated with a significant reduction in OOP costs for prescription drugs for
individuals with a diagnosis of cancer. When more recent
2011 data were included, Medicare Part D resulted in a
further decrease in OOP costs. It is not possible to know
from this analysis why Medicare Part D is having an even
further beneficial impact on OOP costs in recent years,
but a potential reason is that Medicare Part D is more
effectively covering prescription drugs when compared
with insurance plans of the near-elderly population. There
was no statistically significant effect of Medicare Part D
noted on medication use, emergency department visits, or
hospitalizations. Therefore, we did not note any evidence
that there was a cost offset related to implementation of
Medicare Part D in those services and this finding has
been confirmed in previous studies of a population of
patients without cancer.2,32,33 It is interesting to note that
Cancer

November 1, 2014

Medicare Part D Impact on Drug and Medical Use/Kircher et al

we did see that Medicare Part D was associated with a
reduction of outpatient visits of 1.55 beyond trends
observed in the near-elderly group. The reasons for this
decrease are beyond the scope of the current analysis, but
it is possible that increased access to affordable prescription medications with Medicare Part D resulted in more
controlled illness requiring less use of medical visits. Further studies could help to determine whether the findings
of the current study represent a clinically significant
decrease in outpatient use.
Of individuals with a cancer diagnosis, 21% have at
least 1 medication that is associated with cancer treatment. This highlights that individuals with cancer have
many other comorbidities for which they receive medications and that the majority of their OOP costs are not specifically associated with their cancer diagnosis. This also
indicates that in the time period studied, antineoplastics
in the form of oral chemotherapy or biologics comprised a
small percentage of medications for an individual with a
cancer diagnosis. With the increasing use of oral agents,
this trend will need to be followed in the future.
The current study has several limitations. There are
challenges in the inferences made by a differences-indifferences approach that are based on assumptions that
may not hold true. For example, this approach requires
that, in the absence of the treatment or, in the case of the
current study Medicare Part D, the average outcomes for
the exposed and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. It is not certain that the near-elderly
and Medicare populations would have experienced similar
trends in use and expenditure if Medicare Part D had not
been implemented. This analysis is also limited in that
small sample sizes in the MEPS did not allow for a more
granular analysis of specific drugs of interest (eg, high-cost
drugs such as imatinib or capecitabine). Because there were
so few individuals receiving a single drug, we were limited
to using larger drug categories such as “antineoplastics.”
Another limitation is that the most recent data set was from
2011 and may not be recent enough to capture the cost
implications of trends in oral agents. This study does not
contain recent enough data to study the impact of health
care reform, which was implemented in 2010, and this
analysis will need to be repeated in the future to fully
understand the impact of these changes in oncologic care.
Another limitation to the use of this type of survey data are
that the conditions and medications are self-reported.
In this era of health care reform, the overall cost of
health care is rising and cancer treatments are among the
most expensive. It will become increasingly important to
understand whether our existing policies, including
Cancer

November 1, 2014

Medicare Part D, will adequately protect patients with
cancer from unsustainable OOP burdens. Although the
current analysis found that Medicare Part D reduced the
OOP cost, in its existing form the policy is unlikely to be
able to accommodate the rising cost and number of oral
agents in oncology. For this reason, there must be additional policies beyond Medicare Part D to ensure affordable cancer care. At the state level, 29 states plus the
District of Columbia have passed drug parity laws that
address the disparity between insurance coverage of intravenous and oral agents by mandating equal cost-sharing.
Federally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA) contains provisions that will likely impact the
OOP burden for patients with cancer. The ACA aims to
close the coverage gap in Medicare Part D coverage by the
year 2020; however, with high-cost drugs, even a small
coinsurance percentage may translate into significant costs
and burdens to most patients. In addition, the ACA
imposes maximum individual and family annual limits on
OOP costs for all services ($6350 and $12,700, respectively, in 2014). As cancer treatments become increasingly
complex and costly, policies aimed at controlling OOP
costs must also evolve so we can deliver high-quality, accessible, and affordable cancer therapies.
