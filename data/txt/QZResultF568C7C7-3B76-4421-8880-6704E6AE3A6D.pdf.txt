Abstract
The death rate for pancreatic cancer approximates the
number of new cases each year, and when diagnosed, current
therapeutic regimens provide little benefit in extending
patient survival. These dire statistics necessitate the development of enhanced single or combinatorial therapies to
decrease the pathogenesis of this invariably fatal disease.
Melanoma differentiation–associated gene-7/interleukin-24
(mda-7/IL-24) is a potent cancer gene therapeutic because
of its broad-spectrum cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing
properties as well as its multipronged indirect antitumor
activities. However, pancreatic cancer cells show inherent
resistance to mda-7/IL-24 that is caused by a block of
translation of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA in these tumor cells. We
now reveal that a dietary agent perillyl alcohol (POH) in
combination with Ad.mda-7 efficiently reverses the mda-7/IL24 ‘‘protein translational block’’ by inducing reactive oxygen
species, thereby resulting in mda-7/IL-24 protein production,
growth suppression, and apoptosis. Pharmacologic inhibitor
and small interfering RNA studies identify xanthine oxidase as a
major source of superoxide radical production causing these
toxic effects. Because both POH and Ad.mda-7 are being
evaluated in clinical trials, combining a dietary agent and a
virally delivered therapeutic cytokine provides an innovative
approach for potentially treating human pancreatic cancer.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the predominant form of
pancreatic cancer and one of the most lethal and aggressive human
malignancies. Approximately 37,000 new cases are diagnosed
annually in the United States alone, which is virtually the same
number of deaths reported to occur every year due to metastatic
complications (an estimate of the National Cancer Institute shows
this number to be 33,370 for 2007). Meaningful therapy in the form
of surgical resection is feasible only with early-stage detection, but
this applies to just <20% of patients and results in a 5-year survival

of <20% (1, 2). For the vast majority of patients, the overall 5-year
survival is <5%, which is attributable to multiple factors, including
the plethora of molecular genetic changes contributing to the
cellular phenotype of pancreatic neoplasms that are believed
to produce resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
This medical problem is further compounded by the lack of
therapeutic approaches targeting metastatic disease. Considering
these terrible statistics, it is imperative to develop rational
molecular target-based preventative and therapeutic strategies
for this consistently fatal disease.
Using subtraction hybridization, we discovered genes, originally
called melanoma differentiation associated (mda), which encode
molecules that are now better defined in terms of their physiologic
and pathologic importance and have been shown to play crucial
roles in cell cycle control, metastasis, senescence, differentiation,
innate immunity, and apoptosis (3). One of these originally
novel genes, mda-7, displayed an inverse relationship with the
pathogenesis and progression of melanoma (4). We showed that
mda-7 manifests tumor suppressor–like functions in vitro and
in vivo in athymic human tumor xenograft animal models (5).
Ectopic expression of mda-7 (by transfection or by adenovirus
transduction) exerts potent growth-suppressive and apoptosisinducing effects not only in human melanoma cells but also in a
wide spectrum of human cancer cells, including malignant glioma,
osteosarcoma, mesothelioma, and carcinomas of the breast, cervix,
colon, lung, ovary, and prostate (reviewed in refs. 6–8). Based on
structure, chromosomal location, and biological/biochemical properties, mda-7 has now been classified as a novel member of the
interleukin (IL)-10 gene family, IL-24 (6–8). Data from multiple
laboratories including our own indicate that mda-7/IL-24, a secreted
cytokine, which also manifests ‘‘bystander’’ antitumor activity, can
retard tumor growth by impinging on several critical signaling
pathways resulting in tumor apoptosis as well as by inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis and modulating immune responses (8–10). Remarkably, in the context of normal cells/tissues, no such growthsuppressive or cytotoxic effects are evident (reviewed in refs. 6–9).
Considering these intriguing differential properties in tumor versus
normal cells, mda-7/IL-24 was evaluated for its in vivo efficacy
using several human tumor xenograft murine models. These results
confirmed potent selective antitumor activity of this cytokine and
prompted testing [using a replication-incompetent adenovirus,
Ad.mda-7 (INGN 241)] in patients with advanced carcinomas and
melanoma (11–13). A recent phase I clinical trial was highly
promising, confirming the retention of tumor-specific activity in
patients. More impressively, mda-7/IL-24 was well tolerated and
showed no adverse effects in these patient populations (11–13).
Based on these data, investigations are now in progress to further

evaluate the potential therapeutic applications of this novel cytokine
for cancer gene therapy in phase II clinical trials.
Although effective in virtually all human tumor cells tested,
pancreatic cancer cells represent an enigma, being inherently
resistant to Ad.mda-7–based therapy (14, 15). Transfection or
adenovirus transduction of mda-7/IL-24 under conditions in which
growth suppression and apoptosis occur in various other human
tumor cells was without activity (14, 15). An interesting mechanism
underlies this resistance, limited conversion of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA
into protein in pancreatic tumor cells due to a ‘‘protein
translational block’’ targeting this mRNA (14, 15). This protein
translational block in mutant K-ras pancreatic cancer cells could
be reversed by ablating K-ras expression as well as by inhibiting its
downstream target, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2,
resulting in growth arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells
in an analogous manner as observed in other permissive cancer
cells (14, 15). We also discovered that augmented generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) could restore mda-7/IL-24 mRNA
translation in pancreatic cancer cells irrespective of their K-ras
status (16). Although of potential clinical interest, many agents that
could be used with Ad.mda-7 for gene therapy of pancreatic

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

carcinomas also manifest nonspecific toxicity, thereby limiting
their utility.
We hypothesized that specific nontoxic dietary agent(s) with
ROS-inducing properties might be agents of choice that would
complement Ad.mda-7 action, providing a safe combination for
human use with potential to abolish the pathogenesis of pancreatic
cancer. We presently evaluated perillyl alcohol (POH), a dietary
monoterpene present in a variety of plants, including citrus plants,
for potential synergy of action with Ad.mda-7. Burke and colleagues
(17, 18) showed that dietary monoterpenes, farnesol, geraniol, and
POH, block growth of transplanted PC-1 hamster pancreatic
adenocarcinomas in Syrian Golden hamsters potentially by their
ability to inhibit the prenylation of growth-regulatory proteins other
than K-ras, including H-ras. Karlson and colleagues (19) showed
that POH is effective in inhibiting the growth of pancreatic
tumor cells harboring activated ras oncogenes, acting in a Rasindependent manner. Stark and colleagues (20) reported chemotherapeutic effects of POH on pancreatic cancer. They found that
POH reduces the growth of hamster pancreatic tumors to less than
half that of controls. Moreover, 16% of POH-treated pancreatic
tumors completely regressed, whereas no control tumors regressed

(20). Published data suggest that POH blocks several important
signaling pathways that include ras and ERK in addition to nuclear
factor-nB (21–24). POH also prevents the isoprenylation of the Ras
family of small GTPase proteins (25, 26). Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of POH has been defined in both murine models and
humans (27, 28), and phase I and II clinical trials have been conducted, which reveal that this dietary agent is well tolerated (23, 29).
Using a battery of human pancreatic carcinoma cells in culture, we
document that the combination of POH and Ad.mda-7 efficiently
reversed the MDA-7/IL-24 protein translational block in pancreatic

cancer cells by generating ROS, via induction of xanthine oxidase
(XO), resulting in pancreatic cancer growth suppression and
apoptosis. These studies elucidate a new combinatorial approach
for pancreatic cancer involving a dietary supplement and a viral
gene therapy that may show promise for treating this devastating
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3 pancreatic
carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
The human immortalized pancreatic mesenchymal cell line LT2 was
purchased from Chemicon and cultured according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Stable clones of PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic
carcinoma cells expressing mda-7/IL-24 mRNA were obtained by transfection of the corresponding cells with an mda-7/IL-24 expression vector and
selection of clones in hygromycin as described previously (16). Northern
and Western blotting, respectively, confirmed expression of mda-7/IL-24
mRNA in these clones without detectable protein.
Virus construction, purification, and infectivity assays. The recombinant replication-defective Ad.mda-7 virus was created in two steps as
described previously (5) and plaque purified by standard procedures.
Cells were infected with 100 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell of Ad.vec or
Ad.mda-7 viruses (50 pfu/cell of each virus) and analyzed as described.
RNA isolation and Northern blot assays. Total RNA was extracted
from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and was used for Northern blotting as previously described
(5, 15, 30).
Purification of polysomes, RNA extraction, and Northern blot
analysis. Polysomes were purified essentially as described previously (31).
Cells (2  106) were infected with adenovirus, and 48 h later, the cells were
harvested in 500 AL Buffer A [200 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mmol/L
KCl, 25 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 100 Ag/mL heparin, 2%
polyoxyethylene 10-tridecyl ether, and 1% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail and RNase inhibitor,
Invitrogen] and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC to clear cell
debris. The supernatant was loaded on top of a 10% to 50% sucrose gradient
prepared in Buffer B (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 25 mmol/L KCl, and 10 mmol/L
MgCl2) and was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4jC. Fractions of 500 AL
were collected, the absorbance at 260 nm was monitored, and polysome
fractions were identified (typically fractions 10–20). RNA was extracted from
each fraction with Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and Northern blotting was performed as described using a
radiolabeled mda-7/IL-24 cDNA probe.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide viability assays. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays as described previously (32).
Annexin V binding assays. Cells were trypsinized, washed once with
complete medium and PBS, resuspended in 0.5 mL of binding buffer
containing 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, and stained with allophycocyanin-labeled
Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room
temperature. Flow cytometry assays were performed immediately after
staining using FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using
CellQuest software, version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson).
Preparation of cell extracts and Western blotting analysis. Cells were
washed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min in 100 AL of
cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate] with
freshly added 0.1 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate, and 1 mg/mL aprotinin. Aliquots of cell extracts containing
20 to 50 Ag of total protein were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred
to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.).
Filters were blocked and stained with appropriate antibodies as described
in Results. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. For all Western blots, equal loading of
protein was verified by reblotting of membranes for EF-1a protein.

Figure 3. Down-regulation of XO expression using siRNA transfection inhibits ROS production and subsequent apoptosis induction in PANC-1 cells following
treatment with the combination of Ad.mda -7/IL-24 and POH. PANC-1 cells were transfected with scrambled control siRNA or XO siRNA and infected the next day with
100 pfu/cell of Ad.vec or Ad.mda -7/IL-24. POH or vehicle (DMSO) was added to the cells 2 h after infection. The next day, cells were trypsinized and replated for
different assays as described in Materials and Methods. MTT assays were performed on day 6. Western blot analysis (A and C ), MTT assays (B, top , average for three
different experiments F SE are shown), ROS detection assays (B, middle ), and apoptosis assays (B, bottom ) were performed 24 h after infection. Average results
of at least three independent experiments for ROS and apoptosis detection are presented, and SD did not exceed 5%. *, P < 0.001. Similar results were observed in
AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells.

Assessment of ROS production. To determine ROS production,
cells were stained with 2.5 Amol/L hydroethidine (HE) or 5 Amol/L
2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) in PBS for 30 min at
37jC in the dark (16, 33). Immediately after staining, cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry (FACS Calibur), and data were analyzed using CellQuest
software, version 3.1. For inhibition experiments, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)
or allopurinol (AP; both from Sigma) was added 2 h before infection with
Ad.mda-7. In all cases, cells were gated to exclude cell debris.
Small interfering RNA experiments. Adherent cells were transfected
with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cationic
lipid complexes were formed with 600 pmol of RNA and 30 AL of
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in 3 mL of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum
Medium (Invitrogen) and added to 10-cm dishes containing 15 mL of
complete medium ( final concentration of siRNA was 40 nmol/L). Cells
were maintained in culture for 24 h and infected with Ad.vec or Ad.mda-7
(50 pfu/cell) followed with the addition of 200 Amol/L POH or 0.03% DMSO
(vehicle) 2 h later. Next day, cells were trypsinized, counted, and replated for
MTT, ROS, Annexin V binding, and Western blot assays. siRNA specific for
XO (accession number NM_00379) and control scrambled siRNA were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

Statistical analysis. All of the experiments were performed at least
thrice. Results are expressed as mean F SE. Statistical comparisons were
made using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. A P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
Combinatorial treatment with Ad.mda-7 and POH induces
growth inhibition and MDA-7/IL-24 protein production in
pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro by generation of ROS. We
used established pancreatic cancer cell lines, AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2,
and PANC-1 (mutant K-ras) and BxPC-3 (wild-type K-ras), as well as
normal immortal pancreatic mesenchymal cells (LT2), to investigate cancer-specific growth-inhibitory properties of combinatorial
treatment with Ad.mda-7 and POH. A nontoxic concentration of
POH (200 Amol/L) was chosen, which might be clinically
achievable in patients, to evaluate a combinatorial effect of POH
and Ad.mda-7. Multiple pharmacokinetic studies indicate that
140 to 500 Amol/L of perillic acid and 10 to 40 Amol/L of
dihydroperillic acid, the two main metabolites of POH, are found in

plasma and urine after oral administration of POH-containing
capsules (34). Because the growth inhibition effect of MDA-7/IL-24
is mediated by generation of ROS, we also included pretreatment
with a nontoxic dose of antioxidant NAC in these studies. In a
6-day assay, POH or Ad.mda-7 alone had no discernible effect on
any cell type, whereas their combination significantly inhibited
growth of pancreatic cancer cells, PANC-1 and BxPC-3, irrespective
of their K-ras status, with no growth-inhibitory effect on LT2 cells
(Fig. 1A). Pretreatment with NAC significantly protected PANC-1
and BxPC-3 cells from growth inhibition by this combinatorial
treatment. Similar findings were also observed in AsPC-1 and MIA
PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma cells (data not shown).
In normal cells, such as LT2, MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression
could be detected on Ad.mda-7 infection alone and simultaneous
treatment with POH did not significantly alter the level of MDA-7/
IL-24 protein (Fig. 1B). However, MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression
was detected in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells
receiving a combinatorial treatment of POH and Ad.mda-7, but not
either agent alone, indicating that POH treatment overrides the

intrinsic ‘‘translational block of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA’’ observed in
pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 1B; refs. 14, 15). These results were
similar in pancreatic carcinoma cells irrespective of carrying wildtype or mutant K-ras and our treatment protocol did not alter the
expression level of p21 K-RAS (data not shown). Pretreatment with
NAC completely nullified MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression in both
LT2 and pancreatic cancer cells, indicating that ROS production
plays a fundamental role in generation of MDA-7/IL-24 protein
(Fig. 1B).
MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression and apoptosis induction in
pancreatic cancer cells after combinatorial treatment of
Ad.mda-7 and POH are dependent on XO-mediated ROS
production. As a corollary to our results obtained for cell viability,
we found that a combinatorial treatment with POH and Ad.mda-7
induced significant apoptosis (30–40%) in pancreatic carcinoma
cells, whereas single treatment with these agents alone did not
manifest apoptosis (Fig. 2A; results are shown for PANC-1 cells and
similar results were observed in AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3
cells). Similar findings were obtained when apoptosis was

viability was analyzed by MTT assays at day 6. B, Annexin V binding assays (top ) and ROS detection assays (bottom ) were done after 24 h. PANC M8, a stable
clone of PANC-1 cells, was untreated or pretreated for 2 h with NAC (10 mmol/L) or with AP (100 Amol/L) and then treated with POH (200 Amol/L) or vehicle (DMSO).
Annexin V binding assays (C, left ), ROS detection assays (C, right ), and Western blot analysis (D ) were performed 24 h after POH treatment. Average results of at least
three independent experiments for ROS and apoptosis detection are presented, and SD did not exceed 5%. *, P < 0.001.

evaluated by two different assays: Annexin V binding assay and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of PI-stained cells
counting sub-G0 population (the data of the latter studies not
shown). Apoptosis induction by Ad.mda-7 and POH treatment
could be effectively inhibited by treatment with NAC and AP, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of ROS-generating enzyme XO (Fig. 2A).
No apoptosis was observed in LT2 cells treated with a single agent
or their combinations (data not shown).
ROS production was measured after different treatment protocols using two fluorescent dyes, DCFH-DA and HE, which enabled
us to distinguish between different types of ROS (35). Following
POH + Ad.mda-7 treatment, HE-stained cells showed fluorescence,
indicating that superoxides are generated (Fig. 2B). However, no
significant increase in fluorescent staining was detected with
DCFH-DA, which mainly detects peroxide/peroxynitrate generation (data not shown). NAC or AP pretreatment completely
abolished ROS generation by the combinatorial treatment of POH
and Ad.mda-7 (Fig. 2B). Similar to NAC, as shown in Fig. 1B, AP
pretreatment completely abrogated generation of MDA-7/IL-24
protein after POH and Ad.mda-7 treatment (Fig. 2C), confirming
the critical role of XO in ROS generation, MDA-7/IL-24 protein
production, and apoptosis induction following the combinatorial
treatment.
Involvement of XO was further confirmed by genetic approaches
using siRNA targeting XO (Fig. 3). In this experiment, cells treated
with scrambled siRNA were used as a control. Western blot assays
confirmed an efficient down-regulation of XO protein following XO
siRNA transfection but not following control scrambled siRNA
transfection (Fig. 3A). XO siRNA-transfected PANC-1 cells, when
treated with Ad.mda-7 and POH in combination, did not show

MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression (Fig. 3A), decreased viability, ROS
production, or apoptosis induction (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis
also showed that a combination treatment with Ad.mda-7 and
POH down-regulated antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins.
These changes are eliminated by treatment with siRNA targeting
XO (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (data not shown).
Single treatment of stable clones of pancreatic cancer cells
expressing mda-7/IL-24 mRNA with POH induces growth
suppression and apoptosis that correlates with ROS production and MDA-7/IL-24 protein production and involves XO.
Further support for the efficacy of the combination of mda-7/IL-24
and POH in suppressing growth and induction of apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells was provided by studies using PANC-1
clones, PANC M8 and PANC M14, and MIA PaCa-2 clones, PaCa M1
and PaCa M2, stably expressing mda-7/IL-24 mRNA (Fig. 4).
Despite stable expression of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA, these clones of
pancreatic cancer cells do not express detectable MDA-7/IL-24
protein (16). In these mda-7/IL-24 mRNA-expressing clones,
treatment with only POH at concentrations not affecting growth
of parental PANC-1 or MIA PaCa-2 cells induced growth
suppression and a loss of viability (Fig. 4A). A potential role of
ROS production in mediating these effects in mda-7/IL-24 mRNAexpressing clones was confirmed by the fact that the antioxidant
NAC inhibited apoptosis induction and ROS production in these
POH-treated pancreatic tumor cells (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of XO by
AP also abrogated POH-induced apoptosis induction, ROS
generation, and MDA-7/IL-24 protein production in PANC M8
cells (Fig. 4C). Similarly, XO siRNA also inhibited MDA-7/IL-24
protein expression, decreased viability, ROS production, and

POH. Viability of the cells was assessed by MTT
assays (B, top ) on day 6. B, ROS detection assays
(middle ) and Annexin V binding assays (bottom )
were performed 24 h after treatment with POH.
Average results of at least three independent
experiments for ROS and apoptosis detection are

with polysomes. Translational regulation requires mRNA association with polysomes. We therefore tested whether treatment
with POH and Ad.mda-7 facilitates association of mda-7/IL-24
mRNA with polysomes, resulting in the generation of MDA-7/IL-24
protein. AsPC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells were infected
with Ad.mda-7 (50 pfu/cell) and then treated with vehicle (DMSO)
or POH (200 Amol/L). Polysomal fractions were isolated from
the cell lysates and analyzed by Northern blotting using an mda-7/
IL-24 cDNA probe. We confirmed that in the presence of POH,
mda-7/IL-24 mRNA is associated with polysomes to a significantly
greater extent when compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 6A).

Discussion
Despite aggressive therapeutic approaches, resistance of pancreatic cancer to established treatment regimens still constitutes a
major problem in providing long-term survival benefit to these
patients. In this investigation, we show a remarkable synergism
between the action of a dietary agent, POH, and a gene therapy,
mda-7/IL-24, in inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth in vitro.
Our data show that nontoxic doses of POH sensitize resistant
pancreatic carcinoma cells, but not normal immortal pancreatic
mesenchymal cells, to mda-7/IL-24–mediated gene therapy. This
novel strategy to selectively kill pancreatic carcinoma cells by

mda-7/IL-24 remains equally effective for various types of
pancreatic tumor cells, including those harboring both wild-type
and mutant K-ras genotypes. We also elucidate a primary
mechanism invoking this enhanced sensitivity to the combinatorial
effect of Ad.mda-7/IL-24 + POH that involves elevated ROS
production that reverses the protein translational block in
mda-7/IL-24 mRNA conversion into protein by facilitating mRNA
association with polysomes that ultimately culminates in apoptosis
of pancreatic cancer cells. This combinatorial effect did not involve
a change in K-ras protein levels. Interestingly, our results also
showed that generation of oxidative stress is required for this
process, as pretreatment of pancreatic carcinoma cells with
antioxidants such as NAC blocked both MDA-7/IL-24 protein
expression and apoptosis.
The precise mechanism by which POH can promote the
production of ROS remains to be determined. Multiple sources of
ROS production are activated in response to treatment with
various chemoprevention and chemotherapeutic agents (36).
However, in this investigation, we show that XO serves as a major
source of ROS production in this system. Using a genetic approach
using siRNA, we show that abrogating XO protein levels in these
cells reduces ROS production, MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression,
and apoptosis, and associated with apoptosis changes in expression levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Similar
results were obtained using a pharmacologic approach in which
pancreatic cancer cells were treated with a dose of AP, a small
molecular weight inhibitor of XO, which functions as a specific

scavenger of either superoxide or hydroxyl radicals (37). It is
well established that XO is an important source of ROS, which
generates superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in the cytoplasm (38).
Our results also show that these ROS target mitochondria, leading
to its membrane depolarization and a subsequent drop in
membrane potential proceeded by down-regulation of the
antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Fig. 3). These results
provide evidence that activation of XO by POH is a crucial step
required for effective Ad.mda-7 gene therapy of pancreatic cancer.
However, once MDA-7/IL-24 protein is generated in pancreatic
cancer cells, the subsequent mechanism(s) of elimination of cancer
cells may remain essentially identical to those observed in other
cancer types such as melanoma and prostate cancer (30, 32, 33, 39),
that is, direct apoptosis-inducing effects and indirect bystander
antitumor effects, including inhibition of angiogenesis and immune
modulation.
It is well known that treatments of pancreatic cancer cells with
agents that increase generation of ROS induce oxidative stress,
augment cell killing, and inhibit tumor growth (40–44). However,
similar treatment regimens in normal control cells exhibit
significantly less oxidative stress as well as associated physiologic
and pathophysiologic responses. These results are substantiated
by the observations in the present study where we did not
observe comparable damage in immortalized control cells of
different origins, including those of pancreas. This differential
effect on cancer versus normal cells is widely reported for many
other agents that only affect cancer cells sparing normal cell
populations (45, 46). We hypothesize that POH at low doses
induces short-term initial ROS production by XO, but this burst of
ROS production is not sufficient by itself to induce apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells. However, this initial release of ROS might
be sufficient to abrogate the protein translational block, thereby
resulting in association of increased amounts of mda-7/IL-24
mRNA with polysomes and consequently MDA-7/IL-24 protein

production. This latter event may then promote a feedback loop
resulting in a more significant and intense release of ROS that
triggers mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial potential
drop, and the apoptotic cascade (Fig. 6B). It is possible that
treatment with POH could also inactivate the reduced glutathione
(GSH) antioxidant system, which is involved in scavenging of
superoxides (47, 48). This possibility is supported by the
protective effects observed with NAC and Tiron in this study,
which might restore the GSH levels in combination-treated cells.
Additional studies are ongoing to experimentally validate this
hypothesis.
In summary, we describe a novel approach of combining a
dietary agent with gene therapy as a potent inhibitor of pancreatic
cancer cell growth and survival. The safety of both POH and
Ad.mda-7 has been confirmed by clinical trials and studies in
animal models also reveal that this combination profoundly
inhibits pancreatic cancer xenografts in nude mice (49). These
exciting observations pave the way for future clinical evaluation of
POH and Ad.mda-7 combination therapy in the near future to
determine if this approach has efficacy in patients with pancreatic
cancer.
