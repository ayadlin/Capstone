ABSTRACT
Docetaxel is a cornerstone treatment for metastatic, castration resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) which remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths,
worldwide. The clinical usage of docetaxel has resulted in modest gains in survival,
primarily due to the development of resistance. There are currently no clinical
biomarkers available that predict whether a CRPC patient will respond or acquire
resistance to this therapy. Comparative proteomics analysis of exosomes secreted
from DU145 prostate cancer cells that are sensitive (DU145 Tax-Sen) or have
acquired resistance (DU145 Tax-Res) to docetaxel, demonstrated significant
differences in the amount of exosomes secreted and in their molecular composition.
A panel of proteins was identified by proteomics to be differentially enriched in
DU145 Tax-Res compared to DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes and was validated by
western blotting. Importantly, we identified MDR-1, MDR-3, Endophilin-A2 and
PABP4 that were enriched only in DU145 Tax-Res exosomes. We validated the
presence of these proteins in the serum of a small cohort of patients. DU145 cells
that have uptaken DU145 Tax-Res exosomes show properties of increased matrix
degradation. In summary, exosomes derived from DU145 Tax-Res cells may be a
valuable source of biomarkers for response to therapy.

patients is modestly increased with docetaxel compared to
mitoxantrone by about 3 months [2].
Docetaxel binds to β-tubulin and prevents
disassembly of the microtubule network which can be
detrimental for the cells since it leads to the stabilization
of the mitotic spindle during the G2-M phase of the
cell cycle leading to cell death by mitotic catastrophy.
Docetaxel acts also by inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl2
family members, such as Bcl-2, which lowers the
apoptotic threshold and allows for stressed cells to
undergo apoptosis [3].

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent
malignancy in men in western countries and it is the
second cause of cancer mortality. Localized prostate
cancer is treated by androgen deprivation therapy,
radiotherapy and/or surgery but frequently patients
develop resistance and progress to castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) [1]. Docetaxel is currently the first
line therapy standard for patients with metastatic CRPC.
Unfortunately, the average median survival of CRPC

There are several, well-described mechanisms
of acquisition of resistance to docetaxel either due to
intrinsic prostate cancer biology or generic drug resistance
mechanisms [4]. The former include (i) sustained
androgen receptor (AR) signaling due to overexpression
of AR, coactivator of the AR or androgen production
inside the prostate tumor; (ii) activation of tyrosine kinase
receptor IGFR-1, EGFR, VEGFR and downstream signal
transduction pathways like PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathways; (iii) aberrant angiogenesis, (iv) stromaderived cytokines and growth factors which promote cell
growth and resistance to chemotherapy. The latter includes
generic resistance mechanisms include (i) impaired
drug distribution; (ii) survival cues driven by the tumor
microenvironment; and (iii) overexpression of multi-drug
resistance proteins (e.g. the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters MDR-1, MDR-2 and MRP1 (ABCC1)) which
excrete docetaxel into extracellular fluid and decrease the
lethal, intracellular concentration of the drug [4].
There are currently very few biomarkers that would
predict whether patients treated with docetaxel will
respond and/or acquire primary/secondary resistance.
The golden standard, prostate specific antigen (PSA) is
commonly used but has its limitations that include, among
others, lack of PCa specificity and lack of indication of
early therapeutic response [5, 6]. Thus, there is an urgent
and unmet need for the discovery of novel prognostic
biomarkers and especially predictive biomarkers that will
stratify patients based on the most efficient therapeutic
strategies [5].
Cells secrete a wide variety of extracellular
vesicles (EVs) under both physiological and pathological
conditions, with the most studied type of EVs being the
exosomes [5]. Exosomes are endosome-derived vesicles
with a diameter between 50 and 150 nm and they float
at a density between 1.13 and 1.19 g/ml on a linear
sucrose gradient. Exosomes have been shown to play a
wide variety of physiological roles, e.g. immune response
modulation, presentation of antigens to immune cells,
intercellular communication through transfer of DNA,
RNA and proteins [5]. It is becoming more and more
evident that cancer cells secrete high levels of EVs into
the blood circulation that can be isolated and characterized
[7, 8]. The multiplex molecular composition of these EVs
that may be considered as PCa and CRPC cell fingerprints
has put them into the center of the biomarker research
since they may allow for detection of malignancy by
non-invasive means [5]. In fact several studies have
performed proteomic and transcriptomic arrays in the
EVs secreted by metastatic and non-metastatic cells and
have identified several proteins and miRNAs that may be
used as prognostic biomarkers for progression of indolent
disease to castration resistant prostate cancer as well as
to metastatic CRPC [9–15]. However, none of the studies
published so far has examined the EVs as a source of
predictive biomarkers for response to therapy.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In this study we present our data obtained from the
comparative proteomics analysis on exosomes isolated
from DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145 Tax-Res cells. This
analysis revealed that the molecular composition of these
EVs is significantly different and it includes several
proteins that may be used as predictive biomarkers of
therapeutic response or resistance.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterisation of extracellular vesicles
secreted from docetaxel sensitive and resistant
DU145 cells
We have generated DU145 cells that are stably
resistant to 500 ng/ml docetaxel and extracellular vesicles
(EV) were isolated from DU145 sensitive (DU145 TaxSen) and resistant (DU145 Tax-Res) cell supernatants.
The resistance of the established cell line to docetaxel was
examined by measuring cell death in response to this anticancer drug for 24 and 48 hours (Supplementary Figure 1).
Transmission electron microscopy revealed similar
morphological characteristics between the DU145 Tax-Sen
and DU145 Tax-Res EVs with a homogeneous structure
and a median diameter of about 100 nm (Figure 1A).
Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of the isolated
exosomes revealed that the DU145 Tax-Res cells secrete
about 2 to 3 times higher amounts of EVs compared to the
DU145 Tax-Sen ones (Figure 1B). It is intriguing that the
resistant cells secrete higher amount of vesicles compared
to the sensitive DU145 cells in response to an agent that
targets the microtubule which have been shown to regulate
vesicular trafficking and are implicated in exosome
secretion [16, 17]. It is tempting to speculate that this is a
cellular defense mechanism that has been activated during
the phase of acquisition of resistance. The potential, reprogrammed mechanisms of exosome secretion that are
activated in DU145 Tax-Res are now a subject of intense
investigation in our laboratory. Immunoblot comparative
analysis for generic EV markers showed that the DU145
Tax-Sen and the DU145 Tax-Res EVs are enriched with
equal amounts of TSG101, CD9 and Alix (Figure 1C).
Differences were observed for CD82 which seems to
migrate slower in DU145 Tax-Res derived exosomes and
may be indicative of the glycosylation status of CD82
(Figure 1C). Interestingly, it has been previously shown
that CD82 can be heavily glycosylated and demonstrates
a molecular weight between 50–60 kDa [6]. Further
characterization of the EVs by flow cytometry for these EV
markers did not reveal any significant differences between
the DU145 Tax-Sen and Tax-Res cell derived exosomes
(Figure 1D). Collectively, the obtained data indicate that the
morphological and the marker profile of the EVs secreted
from DU145 Tax-Sen and Tax-Res cells is relatively similar
with the major difference identified on the amount of EVs
secreted and the levels of CD82 detected.

gradient fractions for CD9-APC revealed the differential
enrichment of this exosomal marker in the DU145 TaxSen and DU145 Tax-Res derived exosomes (Figure 2B
and Supplementary Figure 2). We examined the presence
of classical EV markers, i.e. TSG101, Rab5 and CD9
in the sucrose gradient fractions by western blotting
(Figure 2C). It seems that the DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes
that are enriched in CD9, Rab5 and TSG101, show a
broader distribution in the linear gradient, floating in
densities between 1.12 and 1.19 g/ml and the DU145 TaxRes derived exosomes at a more narrow sucrose density
between 1.13 to 1.18 g/ml. These data further illustrate that
the exosomes secreted by the DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145
Tax-Res cells are different not only in amounts but also in
the physical characteristics of the secreted exosomes.

The EVs were further characterized with regard
to their density distribution on a linear sucrose gradient.
Typically exosomes float between 1.13 and 1.19 g/ml on
a linear sucrose gradient. In agreement with the literature,
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) demonstrated that
the majority of the isolated EVs displayed a buoyant
density of 1.12 to 1.19 g/ml, characteristic for exosomes
(Figure 2A) [18, 19]. Importantly, NTA further confirmed
the significant difference in the amount of secreted
particles from DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145 Tax-Res cells
(Figure 2A). Flow cytometric analysis of the sucrose

DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145 Tax-Res exosomes (Figure
3C). Interestingly, proteins associated with metabolic
activity are enriched in exosomes isolated from DU145
Tax-Res exosomes whereas those involved in biological
adhesion and cellular organization are found mostly
in DU145 Tax-Sen derived exosomes. With regard to
molecular functions, DU145 Tax-Sen exosomal proteins
may play a role in enzyme regulator and receptor
activity whereas DU145 Tax-Res exosomal proteins may
participate in nucleic acid binding. This is of particular
interest, since it was recently shown that exosomes
apart from RNA species also contain DNA [7]. Cellular
component and protein class analysis further demonstrated
that the exosomes derived from these two prostate cancer
cell lines have subtle but distinct differences that may
regulate their biological function of recipient cells.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of proteins
identified in DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145 Tax-Res
exosomes revealed a clear difference in abundance between
sensitive and resistant cell lines as shown in the heat map
of the top 100 most abundant proteins (Figure 4A). We

Proteomics analysis of DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145
Tax-Res exosomes, isolated from the supernatants of
the corresponding cell lines, by nLC-MS/MS analyses
identified 914 proteins with at least one peptide with
an FDR ≤ 1% (Supplementary Table 1). Of these, 351
proteins were common in both, 417 were unique for
DU145 Tax-Sen and 146 proteins were unique for DU145
Tax-Res exosomes (Figure 3A). Bioinformatic analysis
using the Ingenuity software revealed pathways in which
the identified proteins are known to be part of. In the
majority of the top 12 identified pathways, the observed
differences were not significant (Figure 3B). The most
prominent differences were found in the eIF2 signaling
cascade for DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes, the epithelial
adherence junctions and the remodeling of adherence
junctions for DU145 Tax-Res exosomes (Figure 3B).
Further classification analysis using PANTHER™
revealed additional differences in the proteomes between

then selected the proteins that show the biggest difference
in abundance levels between the DU145 Tax-Sen and
DU145 Tax-Res exosomes and validated their enrichment
in DU145 Tax-Res exosomes by western blotting. We
used Rab5 and TSG101 as exosomal markers and AIF
as a quality control for our isolations (Figure 4B). AIF is
an intra-mitochondrial protein that would only leak if the
cells are dying or have compromised their mitochondrial
membrane potential, an event that usually precedes cell

death [20]. The most abundant protein found in DU145
Tax-Res exosomes compared to DU145 Tax-Sen was
Endophilin-A2. This protein belongs to the BAR domain
protein superfamily which is known to have a prominent
role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic
vesicles [21]. We confirmed its presence in DU145
Tax-Res derived exosomes by western blotting (Figure 4B).
Interestingly we could detect it only in DU145 Tax-Res
exosome lysates with very little or non-detectable levels

in DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes. Another highly abundant
protein identified in the exosomes from DU145 TaxRes was MDR-1 (Figure 4B). MDR-1 or p-glycoprotein
(ABCB1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that mediates the
ATP-dependent drug efflux pump and often promotes
the development of chemoresistance to anticancer drugs.
Even though the MDR-1/3 protein levels in the cells are
similar, there is a very big difference in the protein levels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

found in the exosomes (Figure 4B and 4C). MDR-1 was
previously detected by Corcoran et al., in their studies on
the potential of docetaxel resistant cell derived exosomes
to change the phenotype of recipient cells [22]. In addition
to that study we could also detect MDR-3 in the exosomes
isolated from DU145 Tax-Res cells. MDR-3 (ABCB4),
another member of the multidrug resistance subfamily,
has been shown to mediate the ATP-dependent export of
21745

Oncotarget

organic anions and drugs from the cytoplasm. MDR-3 has
also been shown to be a lipid translocase with specificity
for phosphatidylcholine [23]. It is of particular interest
that DU145 Tax-Res exosomes are enriched with one of
the defense mechanisms that the cells possess to expel
cytotoxic agents such as anti-cancer drugs. It was recently
published that exosomes secreted from breast cancer
cells overexpressing HER2 are capable of scavenging
trastuzumab and thereby minimizing the available drug
concentration that can reach and kill the breast cancer
cells [24]. It is tempting to speculate that, in a similar
manner to HER2 enriched exosomes, MDR-1/3 loaded
exosomes can act as a systemic defense mechanism where
they upload free docetaxel in the circulating exosomes.
Alternatively, exosomes are used as a bulk docetaxel
excretion mechanism, where multiple docetaxel molecules
are pumped into exosomes in an MDR-1/3 dependent
manner and then excreted from the cells. Whether any of
the aforementioned scenarios are actual and whether the
presence of MDR-1/3 in the exosomes is a cause or an
effect of docetaxel resistance remains to be determined in
our future investigations.
We subjected the isolated exosomes to a sucrose
gradient and probed for MDR-1/3 as well as TSG101 as
an exosomal control. We found a good correlation between
the flotation of exosomes as judged by TSG101 that was
detected in the fractions between 1.13 to 1.18 g/ml and
the presence of MDR-1/3 that was more concentrated in
fractions with sucrose density between 1.12 to 1.2 g/ml
(Figure 4D). These data further confirmed the presence
of MDR-1 and MDR-3 in our exosomes isolated from
DU145 Tax-Res and the complete absence of this protein
in exosomes isolated from DU145 Tax-Sen cells.
We went through the proteomics results and
validated other proteins that were either highly abundant
in exosomes or because they have been indicated in the
literature to be promising biomarkers. PABP4, a poly(A)binding protein at the 3-prime ends of most eukaryotic
mRNAs [25], is another protein that is highly abundant
in DU145 Tax-Res but not found in DU145 Tax-Sen
exosomes according to the proteomic analysis (Figure 4B
and 4C). The western blot data confirmed the proteomic
analysis demonstrating the enrichment of PABP4 in the
resistant cell derived exosomes. The presence of an mRNA
binding protein is expected since it is well established
that exosomes contain mRNA species in their cargo [26].
The enriched levels of PABP4 in the DU145 Tax-Res
exosomes may reflect increased levels of mRNA in these
exosomes and this interesting indication requires further
investigation.
PACSIN2 is a lipid binding protein that has been
shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking and was found
in our proteomic study to be enriched in DU145 Tax-Res
exosomes. However, validation by western blotting did
not confirm this observation but rather showed decreased
levels in DU145 Tax-Res exosomes. This disagreement
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

between the proteomics data and the western blot analysis
may reflect post-translational modifications that mask the
epitopes recognized by the two different antibodies that
we have used and prevent its detection.
Abiraterone acetate, an FDA approved drug,
delivers a median 4-month survival benefit in docetaxelrefractory metastatic prostate cancer. [27]. It acts by
inhibiting CYP17, an important enzyme in the synthesis
of androgens and estrogens and thereby prevents the
bioavailability of androgen receptor substrates [28, 29].
Since this chemical inhibitor depends on the presence of
CYP17 we examined whether we could detect this enzyme
in the exosomes secreted by DU145 Tax-Sen and DU145
Tax-Res derived exosomes. Interestingly, CYP17 could
be detected in high amounts in the exosomes secreted by
DU145 Tax-Sen cells but it was present in very low levels
in the DU145 Tax-Res exosomes (Figure 4B).
Emmprin (CD147) is a cell surface multifunctional
glycoprotein that has been shown to promote PCa
metastasis and resistance to therapy by modifying the tumor
microenvironment and regulating multidrug resistance
[30]. Our proteomic analysis showed that Emmprin was
lowered in DU145 Tax-Res derived exosomes, a finding
that was confirmed by western blot (Figure 4B).
Caveolin-1 is a major structural component of
caveolae, facilitating the cellular processes including
molecular transport and cell adhesion [31]. Its expression
levels correlated well with prostate cancer metastasis
leading to its identification as a novel prognostic marker
[32]. Even though it has significant prognostic value for
metastatic CRPC, little is known about its predictive value
for resistance to therapy. We evaluated the total protein
levels of Caveolin-1 both in the cells and in the exosomes
and found that it is abundantly expressed in the whole
cell lysates and also present in the lysate of exosomes
derived from DU145 Tax-Sen cells (Figure 4B). In the
western blot analysis we found very little Caveolin-1 in
the exosomes isolated from the DU145 Tax-Res. The
significance of this finding for the metastatic propensity
of the cells is not clear.

Validation of selected proteins in castration
resistant prostate cancer patient samples
In order to establish an initial clinical relevance
to our data obtained with our cell line model system,
we collected serum from 6 castration resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) patients, 3 that are clinically diagnosed
with docetaxel resistant CRPC and 3 that are docetaxel
sensitive (Table 1). We isolated extracellular vesicles (EV)
from the serum and measured by NTA, the relative particle
concentration (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 3).
We found that the median number of particles present
in the serum of CRPC Tax-Res patients was higher than
those observed in CRPC Tax-Sen ones. We measured the
protein concentration of the isolated extracellular vesicles

for each patient and it was evident that the resistant
patients have higher protein concentration of extracellular
vesicles compared to the sensitive ones (Figure 5B).
Importantly, we wanted to validate the presence of MDR1/3 as well as PABP4 in the isolated EVs from the patient
serum samples. We observed a good correlation to our
cell line data, for MDR-1/3 and PABP4 that could mainly
be detected in the EVs isolated from CRPC Tax-Res
patients (Figure 5C). The presence of isolated EVs in our
processed samples was confirmed by the presence of Rab
5, Alix and CD9 (Figure 5C). In this small pilot study, the
ex vivo data are consistent with the obtained, in vitro, data
suggesting that EVs may be used as a source of predictive
biomarkers. To validate the predictive significance of these
two biomarkers and of other putative biomarkers identified
in this study, we will use a larger patients’ cohort.

acquired resistance

that have been educated with DU145 Tax-Res exosomes
[34–36]. We found that DU145 cells that have received
10 μg/ml of DU145 Tax-Res exosomes have higher capacity
to degrade the extracellular matrix compared to DU145
cells treated with either PBS or DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes
(Figure 6B). We also examined whether DU145 Tax-Res
exosomes have by themselves an effect on the degradation
of the ECM but we could not detect any obvious differences
in the fluorescence degradation of the ECM (Figure 6B):
The amount of degraded extracellular matrix, depicted as
regions of matrix in which fluorescein has been degraded,
was quantified and found to be higher in DU145 Tax-Res
exosome treated DU145 cells than the matrix of PBS of
DU145 Tax-Sen treated DU145 cells (Figure 6C). The Src/
PI3K/AKT and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades
have been shown to be instrumental in promoting migration,
invasion and metastasis [37]. We examined whether the
addition of DU145 Tax-Res exosomes could modulate the
active, phosphorylated levels of AKT and ERK1/2. There
was no difference in AKT phosphorylation levels but a
modest increase in the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 6D). Collectively these data indicate that DU145
Tax-Res exosomes may have the propensity to promote
migration and invasion in recipient prostate cancer cells.
Interestingly, isolated exosomes from PCa patient’s sera
have been shown to induce enhanced cell proliferation and
invasion of the prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and DU145,
respectively [22]. The aforementioned data warrant the need
for further investigation in clinically relevant mouse models.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
describing biochemical and molecular characterization
of exosomes secreted by prostate cancer cells that are
sensitive or have acquired resistance to docetaxel. We

Functional properties of docetaxel resistant
exosomes
We investigated the propensity of DU145 TaxRes exosomes in transferring the acquired resistance to
DU145 Tax-Sen cells. We examined the uptake of DU145
Tax-Res exosomes by DU145 cells in a time-dependent
manner after 3 hours and 24 hours (Figure 6A). Incubation
of DU145 Tax-Res exosomes with DU145 Tax-Sen cells
did not lead to any significant change in the percentage
of cell death induced by docetaxel (data not shown). We
then examined whether DU145 Tax-Res exosomes could
promote the invasive or migratory properties of DU145
Tax-Sen cells [33]. We utilized, a commonly used method,
namely the extracellular matrix degradation assay to
determine these pro-metastatic properties of DU145 cells

of PBS and stored in aliquots at –80°C. Protein content was
measured by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific).

Sucrose density gradient
We made 0.2 to 2 M sucrose gradient as previously
described [38]. We placed our exosomal preparation on
the surface of the sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged
for 20 hours, 120,000 g at 4°C. The collected fractions
were used for further exosomal characterization: i)
for western blotting and flow cytometry, the fractions
were ultracentrifuged at 120,000 g for 2 hours, 4°C
and processed as described in the western blot and flow
cytometry methods, respectively; ii) for Nanosight
analysis, the sucrose gradient fractions were used directly
as described in the NTA method section.

Patient samples
Whole blood samples (8 ml) for exosome analyses
were retrieved from patients with metastatic castration
resistant prostate cancer treated in the ongoing prospective
clinical trial Concab (EudraCT 2011–004178-27). In this
trial, two different regimens of cabazitaxel are compared
in a 1:1 randomized design; i.e. cabazitaxel at 25 mg/
ml at three week intervals with 10 mg/ml cabazitaxel,
given weekly for five of six consecutive weeks. Patients
in both treatment groups receive continuous prednisone/
prednisolone. Blood samples are collected at baseline
before treatment initiation and consecutively, prior to
every new treatment cycle. The primary endpoint is to
compare the two treatment arms with respect to the total
cumulative dose of cabazitaxel received in relation to
the planned full dose at the 18 week time interval. All
patients included in the trial have previously been treated
with docetaxel but stopped treatment due to disease
progression (i.e. docetaxel resistant patients) or due to
poor tolerability (i.e. docetaxel sensitive patients) which
means that samples from both docetaxel resistant and
sensitive patients were available for analyses.

Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
We used an NS500 (NanoSight Limited, London,
UK) equipped with an 8 mega pixel camera (Andor
Technology, Tokyo, Japan) and a 405 nm laser to measure
the size and concentration of exosomes in our samples.
NTA v2.3.0.17 software (NanoSight Limited) was used
for both data acquisition and analysis. We measured
three independent samples for each experiment and then
we showed their average. Length of each video was 90
seconds with camera level of 14 and detection threshold
of 15 during analysis.

Exosome isolation protocol

Protein extraction and digestion

To prepare exosome depleted media we centrifuged
RPMI 1640 enriched with 30% fetal bovine serum overnight
at 120,000 g, 4°C. This exosome depleted medium was
further diluted with RPMI 1640 to reach the 10% FBS final
concentration which is used for the subsequent culturing of
the cells and collection of the supernatants. For isolation
of exosomes, we cultured the cells with 70% confluence
in multilayer flasks (Millicell® HY flask from Milipore),
substituted the culture medium to exosome depleted
medium and cultured them for 48 hours. The supernatant
was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm disposable
filter. The filtered supernatant was centrifuged for 120
minutes at 120,000 g, 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in
PBS and centrifuged again for 120 minutes at 120,000 g,
4°C. The pellet was resuspended in an appropriate volume
of PBS and stored in aliquots at –80°C.
For exosome isolation from patient samples, 3 ml
serum of each patient were used. The serum was centrifuged
at 1500 g for 10 minutes, 4°C and the supernatant was
collected and ran again at 12,000 g for 30 minutes, 4°C. The
supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm
disposable filter. The filtered supernatant was centrifuged
for 120 min at 120,000 g, 4°C. The pellet was resuspended
in PBS and centrifuged again for 120 min at 120,000 g,
4°C. The pellet was resuspended in an appropriate volume

The pellets were solubilized in 300 μl of 500 mM
ammonium bicarbonate and 1% SDS and sonicated for
1 minute at an amplitude of 20% with 5 pulsed of 5 second
(Vibra-Cell™ CV18, Sonics & Materials, Newtown, USA).
After acetone precipitation the proteins were resuspended
in 0.1% ProteaseMax (Promega), 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate and 10% acetonitrile and protein yields were
between 10 and 85 μg. Five μg of each sample were
incubated for 30 minutes at 50°C followed by an additional
bath soncication of 10 minutes at room temperature.
Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was directly
subjected to a tryptic digestion protocol carried out by a
liquid handling robot (MultiProbe II, Perkin Elmer). This
included protein reduction in 5 mM DTT at 56°C and
alkylation in 15 mM iodacetamide for 30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark. Trypsin was added in an enzyme
to protein ratio of 1:30 and digestion was carried out over
night at 37°C. Samples were run in duplicates.

Liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry
Tryptic peptides were cleaned with C18 StageTips
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) and 0.5 μg of the resulting
peptide mixture was injected into an nano-Ultimate system
21750

Oncotarget

(Thermo Scientific) in-line coupled to a QExactive mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The
chromatographic separation of the peptides was achieved
using an in-house packed column (C18-AQ ReproSilPur®, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) with the following
gradient: 5–35% acetonitrile for 89 minutes, 48–80%
ACN for 5 minutes and 80% ACN for 8 minutes all at a
flow rate of 300 nl/min. The MS acquisition method was
comprised of one survey full scan ranging from m/z 300
to m/z 1650 acquired with a resolution of R = 70,000 at
m/z 400, followed by data-dependent HCD scans from
maximum ten most intense precursor ions with a charge
state ≥ 2. MS2 scans were acquired with a resolution of R
= 17,500, a target value of 2e5, isolation width was set to 4
and normalized collision energy to 26.

blocking buffer and incubated it for 30 minutes with
gentle agitation at room temperature. The beads were
then washed once more, divided into several tubes and
conjugated antibodies against CD9, CD63, CD81 and
CD82 were added. The appropriate isotype controls were
used. The beads were incubated for 30 minutes, washed
twice and ran on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, California, USA). The data were analyzed
and quantified by using the manufacturer’s software,
CellQuest.

Cell death measurements
Redistribution
of
plasma
membrane
phosphatidylserine is a marker of apoptosis and was
assessed by Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FLUOS) (Roche, 14461000). Briefly, 2 x 105 cells per
sample were collected, washed in PBS, pelleted and resuspended in incubation buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH,
pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) containing 1%
Annexin V and PI. Samples were kept in the dark and
incubated for 10 minutes prior to addition of another 400
μl of incubation buffer and subsequent analysis on Calibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San José, CA, USA)
using Cell Quest software.

Data analysis
Tandem mass spectra were extracted using
Raw2MGF (in-house developed software), and the
resulting mascot generic files were searched against a
SwissProt protein database (reversed protein sequences
had been added to database for decoy search) using the
Mascot 2.3.0 (Matrix Science Ltd.). Mascot was set up
to search a concatenated SwissProt protein database
(selected for Homo sapiens) using trypsin and allowing
for one missed cleavage sites. Peptide mass tolerance
was set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da for the fragment ions.
Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a
fixed modification, whereas oxidation of methionine and
deamidation of asparagine and glutamine were defined as
variable modifications.
Quantitative information was extracted using inhouse developed software Quanti [39]. This software
performs extracted ion current quantification. For
quantitative purposes only peptides identified with a
Mascot Score 18 were selected. Such a threshold was
set to fulfil condition of no more than 1% of FDR over
total peptide population. Only proteins with at least
two peptides were considered for quantitation. The
hierarchical clustering in Figure 4A was generated in
Perseus (MaxQuant 2.4) and was done for row and column
tree using the following parameters: euclidean distance,
linkage method average and k-means preprocessing. The
input data were the most abundant 100 proteins.

Western blotting
Cells were harvested and homogenized in RIPA
lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
deoxycholate, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA)
containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail, phosphostop (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), dithiothreitol
(Sigma Aldrich) and vanadate (Life technologies). The
exosomes were centrifuged for 120 minutes at 120,000 g,
4°C. The supernatants were discarded and the pellets were
lysed by complemented RIPA lysis buffer. After 1 hour on
ice, the samples were sonicated and protein quantification
was carried out with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal
amounts of soluble protein (15–25 μg) were denaturated
by heating at 95°C for 5 minutes, resolved in sodium
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF membranes.
The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk
in TBS-T for 1 hour and probed initially with specific
primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody. The protein bands were detected by
chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) exposure on
X-ray films (Kodak).

Flow cytometry
To detect exosomes by flow cytometry first we
bound exosomes to latex beads (Invitrogen, A37304)
and then we stained them with conjugated fluorescent
antibodies. Briefly, we washed 10 μl of 4 μm latex beads
with 1 ml PBS twice and incubated it with 5 μg of purified
exosomes for 30 minutes with gentle agitation, at room
temperature. Then PBS was added to a final volume of
1 ml, and incubated on a test tube rotator wheel overnight
at 4°C. Then we washed the beads and resuspended in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Electron microscopy -negative staining
An aliquot of 3 μl from samples were added to a grid
with a carbon supporting film for 5 minutes. The excess
solution was soaked off by a filter paper and the grid was
rinsed by adding 5 μl distilled water for 10 seconds, soaked
off and stained with 1% uranyl acetate in water for 10 seconds

and then air-dried. The samples were examined in a Tecnai
12 Spirit Bio TWIN transmission electron microscope (FEI
Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at 100 kV. Digital
images were captured by using a Veleta camera (Olympus
Soft Imaging Solutions, GmbH, Münster, Germany).

for 30 minutes and the samples were blocked in blocking/
permeabilisation buffer, which contained 2% FBS and
0.25% Digitonin diluted in DPBS, for 10 minutes. The
fluorescent staining was performed with 1:50 TRITCphalloidin, 2 μg final concentration, and 1:100 DAPI,
1 μg/ml final concentration, for 1 hour. Slides were
visualized on an Olympus FV-1000 Confocal Laser
Scanning Microscope. Cellular footprints were calculated
using the Olympus FV10-ASW software. In brief, cellular
footprints were outlined into ROIs (Regions Of Interest)
and their area (μm2). Standard deviation and p values were
calculated by the software. All measurements were done in
triplicates for each sample well.

Exosome PKH67-labeling
DU145 docetaxel resistant cell-derived exosomes
were labelled with PKH67 green fluorescent (PKH67
Green Fluorescent Cell Linker Midi Kit for General Cell
Membrane Labeling, #MIDI67, SIGMA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, exosomes were
labelled with 2.5 μM of PKH67 dye in 400 μl of diluent C
for 5 minutes, then blocked for 1 minute in blocking buffer
(1% of bovine serum albumin), after which exosomes
were washed with PBS by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g,
for 2 hours, 4°C. PKH67-labeled exosomes were then
resuspended in PBS and stored at –80°C.

Exosome uptake assay
In 8-well chamber slides (Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ II
Chamber Slide™ System, Thermoscientific Cat. #154534),
DU145 Tax-Sen cells were seeded at a density of 2x104/
well, in exosome depleted medium. After 48 hours, the
medium was replaced with serum-free medium and the
cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of PKH67 labelled
exosomes for 3 and 24 hours. At the end of the incubation
period, the cells were harvested, washed 3 times with
PBS containing 0,5% BSA and the percentage of green
fluorescence intensity was measured by using the BD
FACS LSRII flow cytometer. The results were analysed
by using the FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).

ECM degradation assay
The QCMTM Gelatin Invadopodia Assay (Green)
(Millipore, Cat. #ECM670), was used according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the chambers of
8-well chamber slides (Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ II Chamber
Slide™ System, Thermoscientific Cat. #154534)
were coated with 1X Poly-L-Lysine for 20 minutes
at first and then fixed with 1X Glutaraldehyde for 15
minutes. Afterwards, the gelatin matrix, containing 1X
Fluorescein-Gelatin and 1X Unlabeled Gelatin with 1:5
ratio, was added for 10 minutes in dark. The substrate
was disinfected with 70% ethanol for 30 minutes and
the chambers were washed with growth media for an
additional 30 minutes, protected from light. 2x104 of
DU145 cells were seeded per well, in serum free media
and the slides were placed in a tissue culture incubator
at 37°C, 5% CO2, for 24 hours. The DU145 cells were
treated with 10 μg/ml of Tax-Sen and Tax-Res exosomes,
in triplicates for 24 hours. We have also used 10 μg/ml of
DU145 Tax-Res exosomes in chambers that contain only
the ECM. Fixation was executed with 3.7% formaldehyde
