ABSTRACT:
Cells mount a transcriptional anti-oxidative stress (AOS) response program
to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) that arise from chemical, physical,
and metabolic challenges. This protective program has been shown to reduce
carcinogenesis triggered by chemical and physical insults. However, it is also
hijacked by established cancers to thrive and proliferate within the hostile tumor
microenvironment and to gain resistance against chemo- and radiotherapies.
Therefore, targeting the AOS response proteins that are exploited by cancer cells
is an attractive therapeutic strategy. In order to identify the AOS genes that are
suspected to support cancer progression and resistance, we analyzed the expression
patterns of 285 genes annotated for being involved in oxidative stress in 994 tumors
and 353 normal tissues. Thereby we identified a signature of 116 genes that are
highly overexpressed in multiple cancers while being only minimally expressed in
normal tissues. To establish which of these genes are more likely to functionally drive
cancer resistance and progression, we further identified those whose overexpression
correlates with negative patient outcome in breast and lung carcinoma. Gene-set
enrichment, gene ontology, network, and pathway analyses revealed that members
of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways are prominent components of this
oncogenic signature and that activation of these pathways is common feature of many
cancer entities. Interestingly, a large fraction of these AOS genes are downstream
targets of the transcription factors NRF2, NF-kappaB, and FOXM1, and rely on NADPH
for their enzymatic activities highlighting promising drug targets. We discuss these
findings and propose therapeutic strategies that may be applied to overcome cancer
resistance.

to be active only in tumor tissues, which are exposed to

ROS scavenging pathways in order to survive, proliferate,
and resist radio- and chemotherapy [9-11]. While
these basic biological principles have been extensively
demonstrated and reviewed elsewhere [12], especially
in the context of the transcription factor nuclear factor
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2 or NFE2L2) [1315], it is still not clear which groups of AOS genes are
overexpressed in multiple cancers compared with normal
tissues. Similarly, it is as yet not defined which groups
of AOS genes predict for bad prognosis and in different
cancer entities.
Here, we systematically evaluated the mRNA
expression patterns of all genes (n=285) annotated by
GO(Gene Ontology) as being involved in ‘oxidative stress’
(including AOS genes) in publicly available microarray
data sets and identified a sub-group of genes that is highly
overexpressed in multiple cancers compared to normal
tissues. Subsequently, by using multiple unsupervised
analyses, we found that the glutathione and thioredoxin

pathways are significantly enriched among these genes.
Interestingly, high expression of a significant number
of these genes is negatively correlated with survival in
breast and lung carcinoma, suggesting that they might
play a protective role in cancer cells as opposed to merely
reflecting a transcriptional response to oxidative stress.
We discuss these genes, the regulators of their expression,
their specific role in cancer, and possible therapeutic
strategies that can hit these targets.

Identification of oxidative stress response genes
highly expressed in multiple cancers: enrichment
in glutathione and thioredoxin pathways-related
genes
We wondered whether specific oxidative stress
response genes are highly overexpressed in cancer
as compared to normal tissues. Because we are
primarily interested in how cancer cells adapt to their
microenvironment found within solid tumors we focused
our analysis on carcinomas as they constitute the
most frequent type of solid tumors. Using hierarchical
clustering, we observed that the 285 genes cluster into 6
clusters (hereafter referred to as “groups”) (Figure 1; Table
S1). Groups 2-5 were found to be cancer type specific
(Figure 1; Table S1). While these may be interesting
in the context of the corresponding cancers entity, they
may also reflect genes highly expressed in the tissue of
origin, and therefore will require further in-depth analysis.
More interestingly, we identified a group of genes that is
highly overexpressed in multiple cancers compared to
normal tissues (group 6), as well as a group that is highly
overexpressed in normal tissues compared to cancers
(group 1).

GO analysis using bioprofiling.de [16] (Table S2)
confirmed that in both groups ‘response to oxidative stress’
and ‘response to hydrogen peroxide’ were the top two
categories (p<10-15) confirming, as expected, that both
lists (groups 1 and 6) are significantly enriched in genes
involved in oxidative stress response. While the first two
GO categories were similar between group 1 and group 6
the third was different. ‘Aging’ was the third identified GO
category in the list of genes that are highly expressed in
normal tissues (group 1) (p<10-7) while ‘cellular response
to hydrogen peroxide’ (p<10-12) was the third category
found in the list of genes that are highly expressed in
cancer (group 6) (Table S2). It is interesting to note that
the expression of AOS genes that are linked to aging is a
feature of normal tissue in light of the discussion on the
similarities and differences between expression of stress
genes in cancer and aging [10, 17].
To identify possible common biological features
of the genes represented in each of the two lists we next
queried common protein folds of the encoded proteins.
Using Interpro (bioprofiling.de; [16]) we found that the
list of genes that are highly expressed in cancer (group
6) is significantly enriched (p<10-6; Table S3) in proteins
that contain ‘Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C/
Thiol specific antioxidant’ domains, ‘Thioredoxin fold’,
and ‘Thioredoxin like fold’, whereas the genes that are
highly expressed in normal tissues (group 1) did not result
in specifically enriched protein fold(s). Moreover, using
pathway and network analysis (bioprofiling.de R_Spider;
[18]), we found the ‘Glutathione metabolism’ pathway
among the genes highly expressed in cancers (11 genes;

p=0.01) with a specific sub-group of 9 genes (p<0.005)
whose products are known to interact with one another,
such as glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)
and glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM)
(Figure 2A)[19]. Collectively, these analyses suggest that
elevated glutathione synthesis and thioredoxin pathway
activity are common features of cancer cells.

Identification of AOS response genes highly
expressed in cancers which predict negative
patient outcome
In order to identify possible drug targets within the
list of genes that are up-regulated in cancer (group 6) we
used the bioprofiling.de GENE_SRV tool that screens a
list of genes against publicly available expression and
patient survival data [20]. Specifically, this tool identifies
cancer entities in which a particular gene signature is
significantly enriched for predictors of patient outcome.
We found significant predictive power of some genes in
group 6 (highly expressed in cancers) in breast and lung
cancers (p=0.035) and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) (p=0.037). Since this study exclusively addresses
AOS genes in solid tumors, we focus our discussion on the
first two cancer entities. Kaplan-Meier plots for all genes
that exhibited significant predictive power are summarized
in Table 1 and Figure S1-3 (typical plots are shown in
Figure 2B).
In lung cancer, 9 genes correlated with poor
prognosis, including GCLC, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase

(quinone) 1 (NQO1) and thioredoxin (TXN), and 1 with
good outcome (Figure 2B and Figure S1). In breast
cancer, 17 genes were associated with poor prognosis,
such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),
heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (HMOX1) and thioredoxin
reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and only 2 with good outcome
(Table 1 and Figure S2-S3). The finding that the majority
of the genes are predictors for negative patient outcome
supports the model that the AOS response genes, which
are up-regulated in cancer, may facilitate cancer cell
adaptation to the tumor environment and/or resistance to
therapy. We therefore argue that the genes identified by
our analyses as being highly overexpressed in carcinomas
and correlating negatively with prognosis may constitute
attractive drug targets as well, which will be further
discussed below.

members of this system are highly overexpressed in
multiple cancers (Figure 1; group 6) and confer dismal
prognosis in lung and breast cancers (Table 1 and Figure
S1-S3). TXN is a small protein that reduces oxidized
proteins and supports peroxiredoxin (PRDX)-mediated
H2O2 clearance (Figure 3) [21]. It also positively
regulates the activity of PTP1B, the phosphatase of the
tyrosine kinase PDGF-beta, leading to increased PDGFbeta signaling [20] and it negatively regulates the tumor
suppressor PTEN [22, 23]. These functions point to an
oncogenic role of TXN.
In support to this notion, the expression of a number
of TXN-related genes has been reported to predict
negative patient outcome in multiple cancers [24]. Among
the TXN-related genes we identified to be up-regulated
in cancers (group 6), TXN expression was associated
with reduced survival in various cancers, such as gastric,
colorectal, non-small cell lung cancers and squamous
cell carcinoma [25-27], whereas TXNRD1 expression
was correlated with poor survival in breast cancer and
squamous cell carcinoma [28, 29]. Furthermore, PRDX1
level was found to predict poor patient survival in nonsmall cell lung, ovarian, and breast cancers [30-32], and
PRDX3 and PRDX4 expression were correlated with poor
prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma and squamous cell

carcinoma respectively [33, 34].
Among TXN pathway inhibitors, the TXN
inhibitor PX-12 was shown to be well-tolerated in phase
I trials [35]. However, in a phase II trial it exhibited
limited therapeutic benefits possibly related to its
pharmacokinetics [36], which prompted the development
of better TNX inhibitors. An alternative strategy to inhibit
TXN is to block TXN reductases [37], such as TXNRD1,
that reduce and recycle TXN (Figure 3). TXNRD1 is
an interesting drug target as its gene was found in our
analysis to be up-regulated in cancers compared with
normal tissues (Figure 1A; group 6). Moreover its high
expression correlates with worse prognosis in both lung
and breast cancer (Table 1 and Figure S1-S2). Indeed,
its inhibitor Auranofin [38] can induce apoptosis and
inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro, and is currently tested
in clinical trials for CLL (phase II). Moreover, Auranofin
was suggested to be used for treatment of glioblastoma
[39], breast [40], lung [41-43], and other cancers [44].
Interestingly, Auranofin is an example of drug repurposing
as it is a well-tolerated FDA-approved drug being already
used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [38].

only when both the glutathione and the TXN pathways
were inhibited simultaneously, using BSO and Auranofin,
respectively, there was significant inhibition of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo
[67]. The synergistic effects were efficiently blocked by
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), that replenishes glutathione,
but not by catalase suggesting that the simultaneous
inhibition of TXN and the glutathione pathways rather
than redcution of total anti-oxidant cellular capacity is
responsible for the growth inhibitory effect [67]. Similarly,
it was shown that simultaneous inhibition of TXN and
glutathione systems resulted in synergistic killing of lung
cancer cells [41]. This was demonstrated using Auranofin
and the AKT inhibitor MK2206, whose efficacy depends
on the activity of KEAP1. KEAP1 is a known inhibitor of
the transcription factor NRF2 that promotes the expression
GCLC and other key enzymes in the glutathione synthesis
pathway [68-71]. These data once more underscore that
there is a synergistic effect caused by simultaneous block
of the TXN system and the glutathione pathway. Our
finding that genes enriched for both pathways are highly
overexpressed in multiple cancers further supports this
strategy of inhibiting both pathways simultaneously to
achieve effective targeted anti-cancer therapy.

Glutathione pathway
Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in
the cell and is involved in resistance of cancer cells
to oxidative stress arising from detachment, hypoxia,
radio- and chemotherapy [45-52]. GCLC and glutathione
synthetase (GSS), whose genes were identified by our
analysis to be highly overexpressed in cancers (Figure
2) and to confer bad prognosis in patients (Figure S1),
are both essential enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of
glutathione from glutamate, cysteine and glycine (Figure
3).
Previous reports have highlighted the clinical
relevance for some of the glutathione-related genes
we identified to be up-regulated in melanoma only
(group 5) and in all cancers (group 6). The importance
for glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) expression
as a factor of bad prognosis and of poor response to
chemotherapy has been reported in head and neck, gastric,
colon, breast and ovarian cancers [53-60]. In addition,
high GCLC and GCLM levels were associated with poor
progression-free survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
[61], and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was
found to be specifically high in prostate and lung cancers
compared to corresponding normal tissues [62, 63].
The glutathione pathway can be inhibited using
specific drugs such as buthionine sulfoximine (BSO).
The latter is a well-known inhibitor of GCLC [64] and
has been shown to have only little adverse effects in
humans [65, 66]. However, its efficacy as an anticancer
drug is limited possibly due to bypass effects by other
detoxification pathways such as the TXN pathway. In
line with this notion, it was recently demonstrated that

Transcription factors regulating the cancer AOS
response genes and their clinical relevance
NRF2
Our first analysis is based on gene expression
data that reflects the sum activities of regulators of
gene expression including those of transcription factors.
We observed that in the genes list that predict poor
outcome, 9 are known NRF2 targets (Table 1 and Figure
S1-S3). These include genes involved in glutathione
and TXN pathways, G6PD that is involved in NADPH
generation (Figure 2) and NQO1 and HMOX1 that encode
detoxification enzymes [68, 69, 72-79]. Because NRF2
promotes the expression of oxidative stress detoxifying
proteins, it is not surprising that NRF2 depletion results
in increased tumor formation in mice challenged with
carcinogens [80-83]. However, cancer cells also exploit
NRF2 to reduce oxidative stress and resist chemotherapy
[84-87]. In line with these two seemingly opposing NRF2
functions, recent data provides evidence that NRF2
knockout mice develop more K-RAS induced tumors on
the one hand, but these are less aggressive on the other
hand [88]. These observations support the concept that
cancer cells exploit NRF2 to adapt to oxidative stress and
to resist chemotherapy. This concept gained support by
identification of somatic mutations in NRF2 itself and in
its inhibitor, KEAP1, that lead to increased NRF2 activity
in tumors (reviewed [13, 84, 87, 89, 90]). It is therefore an
attractive strategy to block NRF2 in order to reduce the

2582

expression of its downstream target genes that are involved
in both the glutathione and TXN pathways. Interestingly,
the natural compound Brustatol was recently found to
inhibit NRF2 in cells and to promote tumor sensitization
to chemotherapy in vivo [91], suggesting that NRF2 is
druggable and that using an NRF2 antagonist may be a
feasible therapeutic strategy.

regulation forms the basis for the protective role of NFkappaB under oxidative stress [112]. This is especially
relevant in the tumor context as we found that a number
of these NF-kappaB targets are highly upregulated in
multiple cancers (group 6, Table 1), supporting the notion
of an elevated NF-kappaB activity in cancers as a strategy
to manage oxidative stress conditions.
Several targeting approaches are being developed to
inhibit NF-kappaB activity in cancers. The current strategy
is to block NF-kappaB to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy
and radiotherapy, since previous reports showed that
inhibiting NF-kappaB leads to radiosensitization in
radioresistant cancer cells [114, 115]. This is in agreement
with the capacity of NF-kappaB to support an antioxidant
program of which tumor cells may take advantage to
resist oxidative stress-inducing therapies [116]. Thus,
few natural compounds, such as curcumin, resveratrol
and genistein, have been shown to inhibit NF-kappaB
and to enhance the response to chemotherapeutic agents
(for review[117]). A specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB
nuclear translocation, namely dehydroxy-methylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), was shown to increase antitumor
activities of taxane in a mouse model of thyroid cancer
[118]. In addition, NF-kappaB activity can be blocked by
direct inhibition of its upstream activator IKK, and the
IKK inhibitor Bay 11-7082 leads to enhanced efficacy of
cisplatin or paclitaxel in an ovarian tumor model [119,
120].

FOXM1
Another transcription factor we found to be
deregulated in multiple cancers is FOXM1, an oncogenic
protein known to control proliferation, DNA damage
repair, angiogenesis, and AOS response [92, 93]. Indeed,
our analysis showed that FOXM1 is highly expressed
in multiple cancers (Figure 1) and associated with bad
prognosis in breast cancer (Table 1 and Figure S2). These
findings further reinforce previous studies reporting highly
abnormal expression of FOXM1 in vast number of cancers
and its correlation with poor prognosis [92, 94-97].
FOXM1 is known to regulate the expression of
important AOS genes including catalase, superoxide
dismutase 2 (SOD2) and PRDX3 [97, 98] which we found
to be highly overexpressed in multiple cancers (group
6) (Table S1), at the exception of catalase, exclusively
overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (group 3)
(Table S1). Like NRF2 [99], FOXM1 is induced by active
RAS [97] and required for mutant RAS-mediated invasion,
anchorage independent growth [100], and development of
lung abnormalities in vivo [101].
FOXM1 can be inhibited by classic proteasome
inhibitors [96, 102, 103], by piperlongumine that acts as a
proteasome inhibitor [104] and promotes autophagic cell
death [11], by a peptide derived from ARF [105] and by
the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 [106]. Interestingly,
PD0332991 is currently tested in clinical trials (phase II)
in breast cancer patients emphasizing the importance of
FOXM1 in breast cancer (for review see [95]). Because
proteasome inhibitors are already used in the clinic to
treat multiple myeloma [107, 108], it is possible that
these inhibitors might prove being beneficial in breast
cancers patients, whose tumors highly express FOXM1.
Consistently, several ROS inducers effectively killed
breast cancer cells when combined with proteasome
inhibitors or siRNA-mediated knockdown of FOXM1
[103].

The cancer oxidative stress response metabolic
program: NADPH is a key factor
Our analysis showed that the TXN and glutathione
pathways are up-regulated in multiple cancers at the
transcriptional level and that high expression of a
significant number of these genes is correlated with
poor survival. Because both of these pathways rely on
NADPH (Figure 3) it raises the possibility that cancer
cells will be highly sensitive to NADPH depletion.
Indeed, it was demonstrated that the survival of cancer
cells requires activation of the AMPK pathway to maintain
NADPH levels under metabolic stress, which is usually
encountered within solid tumors [7, 121, 122]. Similarly, it
was demonstrated that survival of cells under detachment
conditions, a hallmark of transformation, is dependent on
the pentose phosphate pathway that generates NADPH
[10, 123]. Moreover, NRF2 was shown to promote cancer
cell proliferation by increasing NADPH generation
through transcriptional up-regulation of a number of
enzyme-encoding genes including G6PD [74] (Figure 3).
Another study showed that TAp73, a transcription factor
that is a member of the p53 family [124-128], facilitates
the growth of transformed and of cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo by up regulating the expression of G6PD and
therefore NADPH levels [129].

NF-kappaB
Our analysis revealed that among the cancer
oxidative stress response genes identified (group 6), a
number of them are NF-kappaB targets (Table 1). NFkappaB is essential for proliferation, cell adhesion,
inflammatory response and AOS response [109,
110], and its activity is deregulated in cancers [111].
Interestingly, a number of oxidative stress response genes
are transcriptionally controlled by NF-kappaB including
SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GSTP1 and the NRF2 targets GCLC,
GCLM, NQO1 and HO-1 [112, 113]. This transcriptional

In our analysis, G6PD was found to be up-regulated
in cancer (Figure 1) and bad prognosis in breast cancer
(Table 1 and Figure S3). As G6PD fuels the TXN and
glutathione pathways with NADPH (Figure 3), we
speculate that G6PD might represent a highly attractive
novel drug target. It is therefore encouraging that
compounds that inhibit G6PD in vitro were synthesized
recently [130]. However, more work is needed in order to
find lead G6PD inhibitors as candidate anti-cancer drugs.

The concept that the AOS response is utilized by
cancer cells to promote their proliferation, adaptation,
and resistance is now widely accepted by the scientific
community and, therefore, numerous attempts to target
AOS response genes as a therapeutic approach have been
reported [10, 116, 131]. However, targeting endogenous
proteins raises the concern of adverse off-target effects.
Thus it is required to determine which proteins play a
critical role in cancer as compared with normal tissues, as
these are expected to offer a sufficient therapeutic window
for intervention. Owing to the increasing availability of
patient-derived gene expression, mutation, epigenetic, and
survival data, it is now possible to use bioinformatics tools
to screen for such targets in large cohorts for individual
cancer entities as well as across histological entities [132].
Here, we used publicly available patient-derived
gene expression and survival data, and identified genes
that belong to two major detoxification pathways.
Specifically, we show that genes belonging to the
glutathione and TXN pathways are highly overexpressed
in multiple cancers versus normal tissues and demonstrate
that their high expression correlates with worse patient
survival, pointing to a possible role of these genes as
drug targets. Moreover, transcription factors such as
NRF2, FOXM1, and NF-kappaB as well as key metabolic
enzymes such as G6PD that altogether drive the activity of
these pathways, were identified in our analysis providing
further support to the argument that these are important
drug targets. Because the TXN and glutathione pathways
are hyperactive in multiple cancers, we hypothesize that
simultaneous inhibition of both pathways via targeting
common regulators such as NRF2 or common metabolic
requirements such as NADPH, may be highly efficient and
should be prioritized in drug development.
