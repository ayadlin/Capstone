ABSTRACT
Deregulated WNT/β-catenin signaling contributes to the development of a
subgroup of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide. Within this pathway, the tankyrase enzymes (TNKS1 and TNKS2)
degrade AXIN and thereby enhance β-catenin activity. We evaluate TNKS enzymes
as potential therapeutic targets in HCC, and the anti-tumor efficacy of tankyrase
inhibitors (XAV939, and its novel nitro-substituted derivative WXL-8) in HCC cells.
Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we found significantly elevated levels of TNKS1/2
mRNA in tumor liver tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor livers, at protein
levels only TNKS1 is increased. In HepG2, Huh7cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown
suppression of endogenous TNKS1 and TNKS2 reduced cell proliferation, together
with decreased nuclear β-catenin levels. XAV939 and WXL-8 inhibited cell proliferation
and colony formation in HepG2, Huh7, and Hep40 cells (p < 0.05), with stabilization
of AXIN1 and AXIN2, and decreased β-catenin protein levels. XAV939 and WXL-8
also attenuated rhWNT3A-induced TOPflash luciferase reporter activity in HCC cells,
indicating reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity, consistent with decreased nuclear
β-catenin levels. In vivo, intra-tumor injections of XAV939 or WXL-8 significantly
inhibited the growth of subcutaneous HepG2 xenografts (P < 0.05). We suggest that
tankyrase inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach for treating a subgroup HCC
with aberrant WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway.

[4]. Sorafenib is the only FDA approved, first line therapy
for patients with advanced HCC [5]; however, there is
no second line therapy available for patients who do not
respond to, or have developed resistance to sorafenib
[6]. Although an increasing number of drug candidates
are under preclinical/clinical investigations, many phase
III clinical trials reported no significant survival benefit
compared to sorafenib [7]. Thus, there is an unmet need
for more potent targeted or adjuvant therapies to improve
current HCC management.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common cancer, and second leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide [1], accounting for more than 745,000
deaths annually. Although predominant in sub-Saharan
Africa and Asia, its incidence is increasing in the United
States, where there are an estimated 33,000 new cases in
2014 [2]. Chronic infections with hepatitis B or hepatitis
C virus (HBV or HCV), and chronic alcoholic consumption
are well-established etiology factors of HCC [3]. About
40% of those diagnosed at an early stage are eligible
for curative surgical resection and liver transplantation.
Treatment of HCC is challenged by its heterogeneous

and pluripotency [8]. It is estimated that this pathway is
deregulated in 50% of HCC cases [9]. In the inactive state,
the effector molecule β-catenin is degraded and rendered
inactive in the cytoplasm by the multi-protein destruction
complex consisting of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli
(APC), AXIN, and two kinases, Glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3) and casein kinase (CK1)α/β. In the
active state, binding of WNT protein ligands to the
frizzled receptors triggers the downstream signaling
cascade, causing the destruction complex to disassociate,
and free β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and to
translocate into the cell nucleus, where it interacts with
TCF4/LEF to transcriptionally activate downstream target
genes [10], such as c-myc [11] and Cyclin D1 [12], thereby
promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation. Numerous
clinical investigations have reported elevated levels of
canonical WNT ligands [13, 14], frizzled receptor 7 [15],
and co-receptor LRP6 [16] in HCC tissues compared to
adjacent or normal liver tissues, suggesting hyperactivated
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in HCC cells.
The WNT/β-catenin pathway is considered a
particularly difficult target for molecular interventions,
because of its many non-obvious enzyme targets which
may disrupt necessary and beneficial biological processes
[17]. Despite this, a high-throughput chemical screen
identified small molecule inhibitors of this pathway,
specifically XAV939, which was characterized as a
potent inhibitor of tankyrase 1 (TNKS1/PARP5A) and
tankyrase 2 (TNKS2/PARP5B) [18]. Both TNKS1 and
TNKS2 destabilize the levels of AXIN1 and AXIN2,
thereby reducing β-catenin degradation with consequent
hyperactivation of WNT/β-catenin signaling [18].
Tankyrase inhibitors are thereby expected to stabilize
AXIN levels leading to reduced β-catenin levels and
activity.Tankyrases are members of the poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) family, and regulate post-translational
modification and degradation of target proteins via
parsylation. Thus, these enzymes also promote mitosis and
telomerase function. As such, tankyrases are promising
candidate targets for anti-cancer molecular therapies [19],
and they hold particular promise for HCC since their
over-expression has been previously detected under the
pathogenic conditions of cancer, tissue fibrosis, and viral
infection [20]. Indeed, recent studies of the TNKS1/2
inhibitor, XAV939, and its derivatives demonstrated
anti-tumor efficacy against colon [21], breast [22], and
lung [23] cancers.
Given the strong implication of WNT/β-catenin
signaling in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, we
rationalized that tankryase inhibitors may offer an
effective means to antagonize this pathway to achieve
therapeutic effects in HCC. In the current study, we
investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of XAV939 and
a novel nitro-substituted derivative (WXL-8), in both
in vitro and in vivo models of HCC, and demonstrated that
tankyrase inhibition is a feasible approach in the treatment
of HCC.

TNKS1 and TNKS2 mRNA and protein levels in
human HCC tumors
To determine the clinical significance of TNKS1 or
TNKS2 in HCC, we first measured their mRNA expression
levels in biopsies obtained from 29 HCC patients, in
comparison to matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. The
mRNA expression levels of both TNKS1 and TNKS2 were
significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in HCC tumors compared
to their matched non-tumor tissues (Figure 1A). This was
verified at the protein level, where we observed enhanced
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for TNKS1/2 in
representative pairs of HCC and matched non-tumor
liver sections from four HCC patients (Figure 1B). We
further detected TNKS1 and TNKS2 using Western blot
in 20 pairs of HCC and matched non-tumor liver extracts,
and observed elevated TNKS1 expression in 16 of 20 HCC
patients (80%) (Figure 1C). TNKS2 was undetectable
using Western blot. The differential expression of TNKS1
protein in HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues was
statistically significant (Figure 1D) (P < 0.05).

Suppression of TNKS1 and TNKS2 inhibits
in vitro proliferation of HCC cells
To validate the therapeutic potential of targeting
TNKS1 and TNKS2, we first used a RNA interference
approach to knockdown TNKS1 and TNKS2 in three
commonly used HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep40, and
Huh7) and examined the effects on cell proliferation.
Using two independent siRNAs for each target
(TNKS1.1 and TNKS1.2; TNKS2.1 and TNKS2.2), we
observed successful knockdown of the respective target
(Figure 2A for TNKS1 and Figure 2B for TNKS2), and
correspondingly significant reductions in cell proliferation
in HepG2 and Huh7 cells only (Figure 2C). We observed
concomitant decreases in the protein levels of nuclear
β-catenin in all three cell lines after transient knockdown
of either TNKS1 or TNKS2, in comparison to the control
siRNA (Figure 2D). Suppression of TNKS2 (compared to
TNKS1) caused greater reductions in nuclear β-catenin
levels. Despite a decrease in nuclear β-catenin levels
in Hep40 cells, no corresponding decrease in cell
proliferation was observed.

Tankyrase inhibitors XAV939 and WXL-8
inhibit in vitro proliferation of HCC cell lines
Using XAV939 as the lead compound, we
synthesized a nitro-substituted derivative, named WXL-8
(Figure 3A; Supplementary Figure 1). Using the TNKS1
colorimetric enzyme activity assay, we confirmed that
both compounds are effective inhibitors of TNKS1, with
IC50s of 13.4 nM for XAV939 and 9.1 nM for WXL- 8
(Figures 3B and 3C).

formation ability, with XAV939 having more marked
effects than WXL-8 (Figures 4A and 4B). Consistent with
our RNA interference data, HepG2 and Huh7 cells were
also more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of
these TNKS inhibitors.
To validate our hypothesis that tankyrase inhibition
using small molecule inhibitors (XAV939 and WLX-8)
is a feasible therapeutic approach for HCC, we further
tested their ability to inhibit HCC cell proliferation using
three HCC cell lines, which represent different molecular
classes of the WNT/β-catenin pathway: HepG2 cells
(which carry the truncated β-catenin mutation, partial
exon 3 deletion) [24], Huh7 cells (which carry wild-type
β-catenin) [9], and Hep40 cells (β-catenin status unknown,
but responsive to WNT3A stimulation [data not shown]).
Treatment with 2-fold dilution series of each drug, ranging
from 1.56 μM to 100 μM, showed that the inhibitory
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects on cell proliferation were dose-dependent in all
three cell lines, with the strongest effects in Huh7 cells
for both compounds (Figure 4C and Table 1). Our data
suggest that tankyrase inhibition can lead to cell growth
inhibition regardless of β-catenin mutation status.

To determine whether tankyrase inhibitors interrupt
the parsylation-mediated process for destabilizing AXIN
protein levels, HCC cells were treated with XAV939
or WXL-8 at 10 μM, and AXIN1 and AXIN2 protein
levels were detected by immunoblotting. Both AXIN1
and AXIN2 protein levels were increased following
treatment with each drug, compared to cells treated with

were decreased in the treated cells, compared to the
DMSO-treated cells for all three cell lines (Figure 5A).
The protein levels of survivin, a classic downstream
transcriptional target of β-catenin [25], was reduced in the
XAV939-treated cells, and completely abolished in cells
treated with WXL-8, indicating that both inhibitors were
able to inhibit the WNT/β-catenin pathway through their
effects on AXIN1, AXIN2, and β-catenin. In addition,
the levels of TNKS1 were increased following these
drug treatments in all three cell lines, suggesting that
the tankyrase inhibitors led to stabilization of TNKS1,
possibly due to the known ability of tankyrases to
auto-regulate their own expression [18].

To investigate whether tankyrase inhibitors can
inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling, we used the TOPflash
reporter assay as a means to quantify perturbations in
WNT/β-catenin signaling in response to treatments
with XAV939 or WXL-8. Since the HepG2 cells bear a
CTNNB1 truncation mutation, making it insensitive to
exogenous rhWNT3A stimulation, this cell line was not
assessed. Two cell lines Huh7 (Figure 6A) and Hep40
(Figure 6B) that responded to rhWNT3A stimulation
were used for this experiment. Pre-stimulation with
rhWNT3A (50 ng/mL) alone increased luciferase activity

DISCUSSION

in both cell lines. When the pre-stimulated cells were
subsequently treated with 10, 20, or 40 μM of XAV939 or
WXL-8, a dose-dependent decrease of luciferase activity
was observed for both compounds (Figures 6A and 6B).
These results indicate that both compounds can inhibit the
β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity, congruent with
the decreased levels of β-catenin accumulation observed
in the nucleus, which thereby decreased the formation of
β-catenin/TCF complexes.

In
HCC,
the
frequently
hyperactivated
WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway represents a promising
target for molecular therapies. Currently, only a few of
chemicals that have been developed to target this pathway
have entered into pre-clinical trials, and none of these
chemicals have advanced to the late clinical trial stage
[26]. Multiple key factors along the WNT/β-catenin
signaling cascade represent potential therapeutic targets
[27]; here we provide initial evidence to support that the
TNKS enzymes are feasible targets with clinical relevance
in HCC.
In this study, we confirmed the predominant
over-expression of TNKS1 mRNA and protein levels in
human HCC tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor
liver tissues, whereas TNKS2 is elevated only at mRNA
level. Knockdown of TNKS1 and TNKS2 in HCC cell
lines by RNA interference resulted in inhibition of cell
proliferation and reduction in nuclear β-catenin protein
levels, validating the anti-tumor potential of inhibiting
these enzymes in the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Using
XAV939 as the prototype small molecule tankyrase
inhibitor, we demonstrated that pharmacological
inhibition of TNKS1 achieved similar effects as TNKS1
knockdown in HCC cell lines. Mechanistically, decreased
cell proliferation caused by XAV939 was associated with
increased AXIN1 and AXIN2 protein levels, decreased
β-catenin protein levels, and decreased β-catenin/TCF4
transcriptional activity. A nitro-substituted derivative of
XAV939, WXL-8, exerted similar anti-tumor effects in
HCC cell lines.
The cell lines used in this study represent different
molecular subclasses of HCC, such as those with
mutant or wild-type CTNNB1. We show that regardless
of the mutation status of CTNNB1, AXIN stabilization
via inhibition of tankyrases can still effectively

Tankyrase inhibitors XAV939 and WXL-8 inhibit
growth of subcutaneous HepG2 xenografts
The hydrophobic nature of both XAV939 and
WXL-8 precluded intravenous or intraperitoneal
administration. When HepG2 xenografts have grown
to approximately equal luminescence signals, mice
were randomized into three groups (n = 5 each) for
intra-tumor injection with 20 mg/kg of XAV939,
WXL-8, or vehicle control, every three days for three
weeks. Treatment with either XAV939 or WXL-8
caused reductions in tumor volume compared to
vehicle control group, although significance was only
observed for WXL-8 (Figure 7A). WXL-8 exerted
greater anti-tumor activity than XAV939, which is
consistent with in vitro data that this compound had
greater anti-proliferative effect (Table 1), and also
caused greater reduction in β-catenin levels (Figure 5).
Also consistent with in vitro observations, we detected
enhanced levels of AXIN1 and AXIN2 proteins, and
reduced levels of survivin, in xenograft tissues treated
with XAV939 or WXL-8, compared to untreated
xenografts (Figure 7B). Monitoring of animal weight
over the treatment period revealed no significant changes
in body weight (Figure 7C), implying that XAV939 and
WXL-8 did not exert major systemic toxicity when local
tumor injection is applied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

inactivate WNT/β-catenin signaling, suggesting that
AXIN function may represent a key regulatory node
in the WNT/β-catenin signaling cascade. Importantly,
we observed that the XAV939 derivative, WXL-8,
demonstrated superior anti-proliferative activity
in vitro (compared to the parent compound), and was
able to completely abolish the nuclear accumulation
of β-catenin. In vivo, WXL-8 was also more effective
than XAV939 at inhibiting the growth of subcutaneous
HepG2 xenografts, although neither compound
caused any significant changes in the body weight of
tumor-bearing mice. Thus, we have provided the first
proof-of-concept for the therapeutic use of tankyrase
inhibitors in HCC.
While tankyrase inhibition appears to be a viable
approach in cancer therapeutics, several groups have
reported challenges with the use of XAV939 in their
preclinical tumor models. For example, Bao et al
reported that XAV939 was effective against breast
cancer cell lines only under low serum conditions
[22] suggesting that its anti-tumor effect may be
overridden by other growth factors and signaling
pathways. This may be the case for Hep40 cells,
which was least sensitive to both TNKS1/2 mRNA
suppression and pharmacological inhibition, compared
to HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Thus, combination therapy
including tankyrase inhibitors and other conventional or
molecularly targeted therapy may be required to achieve
clinically desirable outcome. In our study, we were
able to observe anti-tumor effects under optimal serum
conditions; however, in vitro anti-proliferative effects
were only modest, also suggesting that combination
therapy or a more potent tankyrase inhibitor may be
necessary.
During the course of our manuscript preparation,
Schultz et al reported the identification of a highly
potent, selective, and orally active tankyrase inhibitor
(NVP-TNKS656) [28]. This compound had a
significantly improved IC50 (to nm level) and achieved
good plasma and tumor exposure levels in mice, with
a decrease in Axin2 mRNA levels as early as 4 hours
post-treatment. However, no study has yet shown its
in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in any tumor type. Thus,
it would be of interest to evaluate the toxicity and
anti-tumor efficacy of this compound (either singly
or in combination with other standard of care agents
such as sorafenib) in mouse models of HCC, including
patient-derived xenografts.
Taken together, we demonstrate that TNKS1 and
TNKS2 are clinically relevant and druggable targets for
a subgroup of HCC patients. Pharmacological inhibition
of these enzymes may achieve desirable anti-tumor
effects via AXIN stabilization with subsequent effective
attenuation of downstream β-catenin signaling, and offer
a new approach for the treatment of multiple cancers that
over express TNKS1 or TNKS2.

were: 1:2500 goat anti-rabbit and 1:2500 goat
anti-mouse (sc-2006 and sc-2005 respectively; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and 1:2500 anti-sheep
(HAF016; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Protein
band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software
and normalized to the internal loading control GAPDH.

Transient siRNA transfection
Knockdown experiments using siRNA were
done using two independent pre-validated siRNAs
that targeted human TNKS1 or TNKS2, and a Silencer
Negative Control No. 1 siRNA (used as control)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HepG2, Huh7, and Hep40
cells were seeded in 96-well plates, with 4000 cells in
200 μL of media per well. Target-specific and control
siRNAs were mixed separately with Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) to obtain a final concentration of 25 nM and
incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes before
adding to the cells. At 72 hours post-transfection, cell
viability was assayed as described below after removal
of cell media.

Colony formation assay
Each of the HCC cell lines was seeded in 6-well
plates, with 5000 cells in 2 mL of media per well. The
cells were then treated with either 0.1% DMSO alone
(used as vehicle control) or with 10 μM of XAV939 or
WXL-8 (dissolved in DMSO) and incubated for 10 days,
until colonies became sufficiently large to quantify. The
media and compounds were replaced on days 3, 6 and 9.
On day 10, the cells were washed once with 1x phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), fixed in ice-cold methanol
for 10 minutes, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet
(in 25% methanol) for 10 minutes at room temperature.
After rinsing with double-distilled water and drying at
room temperature, images of the colonies were obtained
using an Epson scanner. Each treatment was evaluated
in triplicates, and representative images are shown.
For relative quantification of colony formation, we
determined the colony staining intensity by solubilizing
the cell-associated dye in DMSO and measuring
absorbance (OD580) of the dye–DMSO solution in a
Powerwave XS microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek,
Winooski, VT) [29].

Immunohistochemistry of HCC patient samples
HCC and adjacent non-tumor samples were
embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm thickness for
immunohistochemical staining. Slides were pretreated
with citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) for
heat-induced epitope retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked with 3% H2O2. Non-specific protein
binding was blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 hour.
Primary TNKS 1/2 antibodies at 1:50 dilution were added
to the sections and incubated at 4°C overnight. Secondary
antibodies were added to the sections and incubated at

Cell proliferation assay
Each of the HCC cell lines was seeded in 96-well,
clear bottom plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ),
with 500 cells in 200 μL of growth media per well. The
cells were then treated with either 0.5% DMSO alone
(used as vehicle control) or with XAV939 or WXL-8
in a 2-fold dilution range (from 100 μM to 1.562 μM).
After 7 days of incubation, the media and compounds
were removed and replaced with 100 μL of fresh growth
25399

Oncotarget

media and 20 μL of CellTiter-96 AQueous One Solution
Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). After incubation
for 2 to 4 hours, absorbance was measured at 490 nm
using the Powerwave XS microplate spectrophotometer
(BioTek, Winooski, VT).

administered firefly luciferin (150 mg/kg; Xenogen
Corp., Alameda, CA) by intraperitoneal injection. Mice
were then randomized into three groups (n = 5 each),
and given intra-tumor injections of DMSO (control),
20 mg/kg of XAV939, or 20 mg/kg of WXL-8 every
3 days for 3 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored
weekly by bioluminescence imaging after intraperitoneal
injection of D-luciferin (Xenogen IVIS system; Caliper
Life Sciences, Hopkinton, CA). Additionally, tumor size
was measured with a caliper before and after treatments,
and the tumor volumes were calculated using the formula:
[W(2) × L]/2. The whole body weight of each animal was
also monitored during the course of treatment.

TOPflash luciferase reporter assay
The Huh7 and Hep40 cells were plated in 24-well
plates, at a density of 2 × 105 cells in 500 μL media per
well. The co-transfection solution (100 μL per well) was
made by mixing 750 ng of TOPflash reporter plasmid
or 750 ng of FOPflash reporter plasmid with 50 ng
TK-Renilla plasmid (for a total of 800 ng) and 2 μL of
Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). The transfection mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 15 minutes. Meanwhile,
the growth media were removed from each well and
400 μL of serum-free DMEM was added before the
100 μL transfection mixture was added. After 6 hours of
incubation, media plus transfection mixture were removed
and replaced with fresh serum-free media containing
XAV939 or WXL-8 at a final concentration of 10, 20, or
40 μM supplemented with 50 ng/mL of rhWNT3a ligand
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). DMSO was used
as the vehicle control. At 24 hours post-drug treatment,
the cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega,
Madison, WI) and luciferase activities were measured
using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega,
Madison, WI) and a Veritas Microplate Luminometer
(Turner Biosystems, Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly
luciferase activity was normalized to activity of Renilla
Luciferase. Control conditions were set to one, and fold
activities are shown relative to this. All experimental
conditions were assessed in triplicates, and the
experiments were repeated at least three times.

Statistical analyses
All cell-based experiments were independently
repeated at least three times, and representative
experiments are shown. All quantitative data are reported
as means ± SD. Paired t-test was used to calculate
statistical differences between paired groups. Differences
between two or more experimental groups were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. P values
of < 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical
analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA).

Animal studies were carried out in compliance with
all federal and local institutional rules for the conduct of
animal experiments. To generate subcutaneous xenografts,
1 × 106 HepG2 cells were suspended in 100 μL of
Dulbecco’s PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and injected
subcutaneously near the right forelimb of adult (4–6 weeks
old) male NOD-scid-gamma (NSG) mice (Charles River
Laboratories Inc., Cambridge, MA). The HepG2 cells
were transduced with self-inactivating lentivirus that
carried a ubiquitin promoter driving a trifusion reporter
gene, which harbored reporter genes for detection by
bioluminescence (firefly luciferase [Fluc]), fluorescence
(mrfp or egfp), and positron emission tomography
(ttk), at a multiplicity of infection of 5, as reported
previously [30]. Optical imaging was done at day 7
(Supplementary Figure 5) and day 14 (Supplementary
Figure 6) to ensure equal tumor-associated luciferase
activity within each mouse. For imaging, mice were
