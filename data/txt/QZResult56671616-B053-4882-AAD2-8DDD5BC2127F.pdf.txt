ABSTRACT
Human cancers are heterogeneous containing stem-like cancer cells operationally
defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs) that possess great tumor-initiating and long-term
tumor-propagating properties. In this study, we systematically dissect the phenotypic,
functional and tumorigenic heterogeneity in human prostate cancer (PCa) using xenograft
models and >70 patient tumor samples. In the first part, we further investigate the PSA−/lo
PCa cell population, which we have recently shown to harbor self-renewing long-term
tumor-propagating cells and present several novel findings. We show that discordant
AR and PSA expression in both untreated and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) results in
AR+PSA+, AR+PSA−, AR−PSA−, and AR−PSA+ subtypes of PCa cells that manifest differential
sensitivities to therapeutics. We further demonstrate that castration leads to a great
enrichment of PSA−/lo PCa cells in both xenograft tumors and CRPC samples and systemic
androgen levels dynamically regulate the relative abundance of PSA+ versus PSA−/lo
PCa cells that impacts the kinetics of tumor growth. We also present evidence that the
PSA−/lo PCa cells possess distinct epigenetic profiles. As the PSA−/lo PCa cell population
is heterogeneous, in the second part, we employ two PSA− (Du145 and PC3) and two
PSA+ (LAPC9 and LAPC4) PCa models as well as patient tumor cells to further dissect
the clonogenic and tumorigenic subsets. We report that different PCa models possess
distinct tumorigenic subpopulations that both commonly and uniquely express important
signaling pathways that could represent therapeutic targets. Our results have important
implications in understanding PCa cell heterogeneity, response to clinical therapeutics,
and cellular mechanisms underlying CRPC.

immunological characteristics, metastatic ability, and
sensitivity to therapeutics [1]. Clonal evolution, driven
by genetic instability of tumor cells, and phenotypic
maturation and diversification, driven by cancer stem
cells (CSCs), operate hand-in-hand to generate tumor cell

heterogeneity [2]. Specifically, clonal evolution creates
genetic diversity and drives clonal competition between
multiple subclones in the tumor whereas CSC-directed
differentiation and maturation generates phenotypic
diversity within individual subclones [2].
One of the key biological properties of CSCs is the
‘stemness’, which confers on a subpopulation of cancer
cells two fundamental traits of normal stem cells, i.e.,
self-renewal and differentiation ability. Like normal stem
cells, whose self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation
(i.e., pluripotency) are regulated by an intricate network
of transcription factors, CSC stemness is also bestowed
by critical signaling pathways (e.g., Notch, HH, and Wnt)
and transcription factors and epigenetic regulators such
as Nanog, Bmi-1, and Polycomb proteins [3–5]. It has
now become clear that intra-clonally, genetic mutations,
epigenetic changes and tumor microenvironment converge
on regulating the CSC stemness to generate the phenotypic
diversity and functional heterogeneity of tumor cells [2].
Many different experimental strategies and approaches
have been adopted and developed to purify and enrich CSC
populations. These include cell surface marker-based flow
sorting, marker-independent strategies such as holoclone,
clonogenic sphere formation and label-retaining assays,
functional assays such as Side Population (SP; which
measures the drug-effluxing ability in CSCs) and Aldefluor
assay (which measures the aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH]
mediated detoxification capability), and in vitro and in vivo
lineage tracing assays [1]. To study the stemness properties,
a ‘gold-standard’ functional assay is to xenotransplant
candidate human CSC populations in immunodeficient
mice at decreasing cell doses, an assay often called limiting
dilution (tumor) assay or LDA [1]. The LDA measures
tumor-regenerating or tumor-initiating capacity, which,
when combined with serial tumor transplantations, would
measure the self-renewal ability of the candidate CSCs [1].
Prostate cancer (PCa) is extremely heterogeneous but
the cellular basis for PCa cell heterogeneity remains largely
unknown. Understanding PCa cell heterogeneity is of clear
clinical importance as it likely underlies differential PCa
cell response to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and
other therapeutics such as docetaxel and helps explain PCa
recurrence and metastasis. Work from our lab in the past
10 years has generated important clues to understanding
the cellular heterogeneity of PCa. We have demonstrated
that PCa cell SP and holoclones, as well as CD44+ and
CD44+α2β1+ subpopulations in some PCa models are
enriched in prostate CSCs (PCSCs) with high tumorigenic
and metastatic potential [6–12]. Using a PSA promoter
(PSAP) driven EGFP lentiviral tracing reporter, we have
recently provided evidence that the undifferentiated (PSA−/lo)
PCa cell population harbors long-term tumor-propagating
PCSCs that preferentially express stem cell-associated
genes and can self-renew to generate PSA+ PCa cells by
asymmetric cell division [13]. Of clinical significance,
PSA−/lo PCa cells can initiate robust tumor regeneration
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in fully castrated hosts, survive androgen deprivation, and
mediate tumor recurrence [13]. Many other groups have
also reported PCSC subpopulations [14–24].
One of the issues in PCSC studies is that different
research groups often use divergent PCa models and
different phenotypic markers or experimental approaches to
enrich for putative PCSCs, making direct comparison of the
results difficult. The main goals of our current study are to
systematically dissect the PCa cell heterogeneity via assessing
a spectrum of PCa cell line and xenograft models as well as
primary tumor cells and samples, to address the relationship
between and among different PCSC subpopulations, and
dissect the relationship between PCSCs and AR, PSA, and
castration resistance. The results presented here greatly
advance our understanding of PCa cell heterogeneity and help
to illuminate cellular mechanisms of PCa therapy resistance.

RESULTS
PCa cell heterogeneity: Inverse correlation
between tumor PSA mRNA levels with clinical
parameters and discordant AR and PSA mRNA
expression in PCa samples
We started our studies by systematically analyzing
27 ‘eligible’ Oncomine data sets of PCa cDNA microarrays
(Supplementary Table 1) and by correlating tumor PSA
mRNA levels versus Gleason grade, hormone-refractory
and metastatic status, and patient survival. The results
revealed several interesting points. FIRST, an inverse
correlation was observed between tumor PSA mRNA
and tumor grade in all data sets with information on PSA
mRNA and Gleason grade of the tumors and with sufficient
number of cases (Figure 1A–1C; 13). Reduced PSA mRNA
was also noted in high-grade (i.e., Gleason 8–10) tumors
in the data sets of Best 2, Holzbeierlein, and Wallace (not
shown). SECOND, reduced PSA levels were observed in
hormone-refractory PCa in data sets of Best 2 (Figure 1D),
and of Tamura and Tomlins (not shown). THIRD, we
observed reduced tumor PSA mRNA in PCa metastases
in all 11 data sets that contained ≥ 5 metastatic samples
(Figure 1E–1H). Interestingly, although the draining
lymph node (LN) only occasionally showed reduced PSA
mRNA (e.g., in the Chandran data set; Figure 1H), distant
metastases, e.g., those to the adrenal gland, bone, and liver,
generally exhibited consistent reduction in PSA mRNA
(Figure  1H). Distant metastases also tended to express
lower PSA mRNA than the benign/normal (B/N) tissues
(Figure 1H). FINALLY, overall patient survival correlated
with high intra-tumoral PSA mRNA levels in the data sets
of Nakagawa [13], Setlur, Grasso, and Taylor (Figure 1I).
Strikingly, we frequently observed a discordant
relationship between PSA and AR in individual primary
(Figure 1A–1C), hormone-refractory (Figure 1D) and
metastatic (Figure 1E–1F) samples. PSA mRNA was
decreased across all data sets (Figure 1A–1F; data not

shown) except the Setlur data set in which PSA reduction
was not statistically significant although the decreasing trend
was clear (Figure 1E). Another AR target, TMPRSS2, was
also reduced in most data sets analyzed (Figure 1A, 1C–1F;
13). In contrast, the AR mRNA levels were not correlated
with tumor grade, hormone refractoriness, or metastasis
(Figure 1A–1F; 13; data not shown). In one data set (Vanaja),
the AR mRNA levels were actually decreased in Gleason 9
tumors compared to Gleason 6 tumors (Figure 1C).

Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of AR and PSA
proteins in 11 untreated primary patient tumors (HPCa;
Supplementary Table 2) directly supports this premise
as the 4 subpopulations of PCa cells could be identified
in all samples, although, as expected, the AR+PSA+ PCa
cells represented the major subpopulation (Figure 2A–2B;
Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). In these analyses, AR
showed typical nuclear staining with a spectrum of
intensities (negative, weak, intermediate, and strong)
whereas PSA generally showed cytoplasmic staining
(Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). Occasionally,
nuclear PSA (Supplementary Figure 1C; Supplementary
Figure 2B) and secreted PSA in the lumen of the prostatic
glands (Supplementary Figure 2C) were observed.
Next, we analyzed AR and PSA protein expression
in 23 CRPC samples including 20 samples (CRPC1–
20) in a tissue microarray (TMA) and 3 regular CRPC
(CRPC21–23) samples (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure

3A–3B). AR expression showed wide variability in these
CRPC samples. For example, CRPC5 and CRPC12
showed apparently increased AR expression and AR+ PCa
cells compared to untreated PCa but many CRPC samples
(e.g., CRPC9, 16, and 20–23) significantly lacked AR+
PCa cells (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure 3, Ab, B).
Furthermore, in all AR+ CRPC samples, AR− PCa cells
could be readily identified, e.g., in CRPC8 (Figure 2C)
and CRPC2 and 7 (Supplementary Figure 3B). In sharp
contrast to the AR expression patterns, the majority of
the 23 CRPC samples mostly lacked appreciable PSA
expression or PSA+ PCa cells (Figure 2C; Supplementary
Figure 3A–3B). Only one sample (CRPC12) was found to
have somewhat concordant AR and PSA expression and
only CRPC19 (the patient was treated with Lupron for ~2
weeks) expressed high intratumoral PSA (Supplementary
Figure 3A). The IHC studies in this cohort of 23 CRPC
samples indicate that PSA−/lo PCa cells (which can be AR+
or AR−) are enriched in patient CRPC samples.
Subsequently, we investigated the relative
abundance of the 4 subtypes of PCa cells in 3 AD
(androgen-dependent) and AI (androgen-independent)
PCa xenograft models, LNCaP, LAPC4 and LAPC9 (13).
In all 3 models, the AI tumors were highly enriched in
PSA−/lo PCa cells (Figure 2D–2E; Supplementary Figure
3C–3D; data not shown). In LNCaP AD tumors, ~80% of
the cells were AR+PSA+ and the other 3 subtypes of cells
represented the minority (Figure 2D–2E; Supplementary
Figure 3C). In contrast, the LNCaP AI tumors showed
greatly reduced AR+PSA+ cells and dramatically increased
PSA−/lo (AR+PSA−/lo and AR−PSA−/lo) cells (Figure 2D–2E;
Supplementary Figure 3C). Similarly, PSA−/lo PCa cells
were significantly increased in LAPC4 (Supplementary
Figure 3D) and LAPC9 (not shown) AI tumors.
Interestingly, in LAPC4 AI tumors, most AR localized to
the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 3D).
To explore potential differences between subtypes
of PCa cells in response to therapeutics, we performed
a preliminary study in three types of LNCaP cells
(Figure 2F), i.e., AR+PSA+ wild-type LNCaP, AR+PSA−
LNCaP-abl [25], and AR−PSA− LNCaP-CDSS and
LNCaP-MDV cells, the two castration-resistant LNCaP
sublines we recently established (Rycaj et al., manuscript
submitted). We treated these 3 LNCaP cell types with two
antiandrogens, i.e., bicalutamide and MDV3100 (MDV;
Enzalutamide), two chemotherapeutic drugs (etoposide
and docetaxel), and two molecularly targeted drugs, i.e.,
ABT-199, which selectively inhibits Bcl-2 [26, 27], and
AEW541, an inhibitor of IGF-1R [28], which is important
for the PSA−/lo PCa cells [13]. In this relatively short (72 h)
cytotoxicity assay, the three LNCaP cells manifested
differential responses to the 6 drugs (Figure 2G). The
AR+PSA+ wild-type LNCaP cells displayed responses to
all 6 drugs except Bicalutamide whereas AR+PSA− LNCaPabl cells behaved overall similarly to wild-type LNCaP
cells and showed only resistance to 10 μM ABT-199
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 2G). In contrast, the AR−PSA− LNCaP-CDSS
and LNCaP-MDV cells manifested prominent resistance
to both etoposide and docetaxel as well as to MDV and
ABT-199 (Figure 2G). Interestingly, LNCaP-abl cells
showed higher sensitivity to 10 μM AEW541 than both
wild-type LNCaP and LNCaP-CDSS and LNCaP-MDV
cells (Figure 2G). This pilot experiment establishes the
proof-of-principle that subtypes of PCa cells with distinct
AR and PSA expression profiles may respond differently
to anticancer therapeutics.

PSA−/lo PCa cells: Heterogeneity in AR
expression, quiescence, and resistance to
antiandrogens and other therapeutics
The converging findings from the above studies
are that: 1) the PSA−/lo PCa cells pre-exist in untreated
HPCa; 2) PSA−/lo PCa cells become enriched in patient
CRPC and AI xenograft models; and 3) PSA−/lo PCa cells
respond to antiandrogens and several other therapeutics
differently than the PSA+ PCa cells. We recently employed
a series of lentiviral GFP/RFP reporters to separate PSA−/lo
from PSA+ PCa cells to compare their molecular, cell
biological, and tumorigenic properties [13]. Herein, we
continue to use this system to further explore the cellular
and molecular distinctions between these cell subsets,
investigate their differential responses to therapeutics
in vitro and to systemic androgen levels in vivo, and
interrogate the relationship between the PSA−/lo PCa cells
vs. several other PCSC populations.
Infection of LNCaP cells with the PSAP-GFP
lentivector at an MOI of 20 led to 100% infection and
GFP positivity faithfully reported the endogenous PSA
expression [13]. Consistent with earlier results [13], all
PSA+ (i.e., GFP+) LNCaP cells were nuclear AR+ whereas
only ~30% PSA−/lo (i.e., GFP−/lo) LNCaP cells had strong
nuclear AR (Supplementary Figure 4A). Similar results
were obtained in LAPC9 and LAPC4 xenografts [13;
data not shown]. These observations suggest that the
PSA−/lo PCa cell population is heterogeneous with respect
to AR expression, consistent with the above IHC-based
immunophenotypic analysis of AR and PSA expression in
both untreated HPCa and CRPC samples.
We have previously demonstrated [13] that under
time-lapse videomicroscopy, single PSA+ PCa cells
exclusively undergo symmetrical cell divisions (SCD)
whereas PSA−/lo PCa cells undergo both SCD and
asymmetrical cell division (ACD). Here we employed time
lapse-based single-cell tracking to determine cell-cycle
transit times in two populations of LNCaP cells (Figure
3A–3E). As observed previously [13], the PSA+ (i.e.,
GFP+) LNCaP cells underwent rapid and exclusive SCD to
generate more PSA+ cells (Figure 3A; Figure 3D, top). In
contrast, many PSA−/lo (i.e., GFP−) LNCaP cells underwent
ACD during the first cell division (Figure 3B; Figure 3D,
middle). Very occasionally, we observed rare PSA−/lo

analysis of AR and PSA. PC3 and IGR1 cells, which are known to be negative for both proteins, were used as controls. Note that the wild-type
LNCaP cells (lane 3) were AR+PSA+ whereas LNCaP-abl cells AR+PSA− (lane 2). LNCaP-CDSS and LNCaP-MDV cells were both AR−PSA−
(lanes 5–6). The arrow indicates the ~114 kD full-length AR and lower bands might represent AR splice variants (top panel). G. Drug responses
in subtypes of LNCaP cells. LNCaP (AR+PSA+), LNCaP-abl (AR+PSA−), and LNCaP-CDSS and LNCaP-MDV (AR−PSA−) cells were treated
with the drugs at the indicated concentrations for 72 h. Relative cell numbers were determined by Alamar Blue assays (see Methods). For
Bicalutamide, at 2 and 20 μM, only LNCaP-MDV cells showed partial resistance (P < 0.05). At 200 μM, Bicalutamide even slightly promoted
wild-type LNCaP cell growth probably due to its well-known agonist effects. For MDV3100, at 2 μM, LNCaP-CDSS and LNCaP-MDV but
not LNCaP-abl cells showed partial resistance (P < 0.05). At 200 μM of MDV, all 3 LNCaP sublines showed partial resistance (P < 0.05) in
comparison to wild-type cells. Note prominent resistance in LNCaP-CDSS and LNCaP-MDV cells to etoposide and docetaxel (P < 0.001 for
all comparisons between these two cell types vs. either wild-type or LNCaP-abl cells). All LNCaP cell types responded similarly to 1 μM ABT199 but the 3 LNCaP sublines (LNCaP-abl, -CDSS, and –MDV) showed common resistance to 20 μM ABT-199 (P < 0.01). LNCaP-CDSS and
LNCaP-MDV but not LNCaP-abl cells showed partial resistance to 1 μM of AEW541 (P < 0.05) and this resistance phenotype dissipated at 10
μM AEW541, at which LNCaP-abl cells showed higher sensitivity than wild-type cells (P < 0.05).

underwent rapid SCD whereas the PSA−/lo mother cells
rarely divided again (Figure 3B), suggesting that the PSA−/lo

cells overall divided more slowly than the isogenic PSA+
cells. Indeed, quantification of time-lapse images indicated
that the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells had longer average cell-cycle
transit times than PSA+ cells (Figure 3E). Consistent with
the single cell analysis, PSA−/lo LNCaP cells demonstrated
lower cumulative population doublings (Figure 3F) and
holoclone [10] forming efficiency (Figure 3G) in regular
medium containing serum (which contained small amount
of steroid hormones) than the corresponding PSA+ cells. In
another holoclone assay, in which we sorted single PSA+
and PSA−/lo LNCaP cells into 96-well plates and cultured
them in serum-containing medium. 18 days later, 19
holoclones developed in 36 single PSA+ LNCaP cells (i.e.,
cloning efficiency = 53%) whereas 24 clones developed in
83 single PSA−/lo cells (cloning efficiency = 29%). Taken
together, these results suggest that the PSA−/lo PCa cells,
in the presence of androgen, are more quiescent than PSA+
PCa cells.
Are there any differences between PSA−/lo and PSA+
PCa cells in the absence of androgen or in the presence of
stresses? In our earlier studies [13], we performed cDNA
microarray analyses comparing gene expression profiles
in PSA−/lo and PSA+ LNCaP as well as xenograft LAPC9
cells. A total of 570 probesets representing 337 genes (see
Methods) were commonly upregulated (1.5 fold; P < 0.05)
in PSA−/lo cells in both cell types (Supplementary Figure
4B). Remarkably, when we performed Gene Ontology (GO)
analysis on the 337 genes using DAVID, the top 10 GO
terms were all related, in some ways, to cellular responses
to stress and wound healing (Supplementary Figure 4C).
Preferential enrichment of anti-stress and regeneration
genes coupled with their quiescent nature would render
the PSA−/lo PCa cells resistant to stresses and therapeutics.
Several experiments confirmed this prediction. First,
when acutely purified PSA+ and PSA−/lo LNCaP cells were
cultured in androgen-deficient conditions, i.e., in medium
containing charcoal dextran-stripped serum (CDSS), the
PSA−/lo cells underwent significant expansion (Figure 4A),
sharply contrasting with the scarce growth observed in
androgen-proficient conditions (Figure 3F). As a matter
of fact, only the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells showed significant
survival and expansion during continued culture of up to
1 month (Figure 4B). Importantly, the suppressive effects
of CDSS on PSA+ LNCaP cells could be dose-dependently
relieved by exogenous R1881 (Figure 4C). In another set
of experiments, we treated the two purified populations of
LNCaP cells side-by-side with CDSS plus bicalutamide
(20 μM), etoposide (1 μM), paclitaxel (20 nM), or H2O2
(1 μM) for 4 days and then analyzed for apoptosis. As shown
in Figure 4D, the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells were more resistant to
all these treatments. Finally, we performed yet another set of
side-by-side experiments with the two purified populations
using the MTT assays to measure the cells that survived
treatments. As shown in Figure 4E, PSA−/lo cells survived
better than PSA+ LNCaP cells in response to both Taxol
and H2O2. Since we employed two purified populations of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LNCaP cells to directly compare their apoptotic sensitivities
(Figure 4), the results excluded the possibility that treatments
caused de-differentiation in turning PSA+ LNCaP cells to
PSA−/lo cells during the treatment period (i.e., 4 days). In
support, we observed that all live PSA+ LNCaP cells 48 h
after treatments remained GFP+ (not shown).

Systemic androgen levels regulate the relative
abundance of PSA+ and PSA−/lo PCa cells
in tumors
We next explored how systemic androgen levels
dynamically affect the relative abundance of PSA−/lo
vs. PSA+ cells in the tumors (Figure 5). LAPC9 tumors
continuously maintained in male mice (i.e., the ‘AD’
tumors) contained 20.9% ± 10.3% (n = 10) PSA−/lo cells
with the majority being PSA+ cells (Figure 5A, and
5C). When bulk LAPC9 cells from these AD tumors
were transferred to androgen-deficient hosts (i.e., either
castrate male or female mice) for ~2 months, PSA+ cells
declined significantly whereas PSA−/lo cells increased to
~50% (Figure 5A, and 5C). When LAPC9 tumors were
maintained in androgen-deficient hosts for ~2 years (i.e.,
the ‘AI’ tumors), PSA−/lo cells increased to 89.3% ± 9.8%
(n = 12) (Figure 5B). When unsorted LAPC9 cells from
such AI tumors were put back in intact male mice, PSA+
LAPC9 cells in the tumors again increased (Figure 5B).
These results are remarkably similar to what we observed
earlier in AD/AI LNCaP and LAPC4 systems and suggest
that systemic androgen levels dynamically regulate the
abundance of PSA+ vs. PSA−/lo cells in prostate tumors.
When unsorted LAPC9 cells from the AD tumors, in
which 70–90% cells were PSA+, were implanted in different
hosts, they initiated much larger tumors in male mice than
in castrated male or female mice (Figure 5D). In contrast,
when bulk LAPC9 cells from the AI tumors, in which ~90%
cells were PSA−/lo, were implanted in different hosts, they
initiated larger tumors in androgen-deficient hosts (Figure
5E). These results indicate that the relative abundance of
PSA+ versus PSA−/lo cells greatly influences tumor growth

Evidence that PSA−/lo PCa cells possess distinct
epigenetic profiles: Analysis of bivalent
chromatin domains in several genes
The above observations that systemic androgen levels
regulate the relative abundance of the two populations of
PCa cells in vivo implicate epigenetic mechanisms. Previous
microarray analyses showed that the PSA−/lo PCa (LAPC9,
LNCaP, as well as HPCa) cells overexpressed several dozens
of stem cell-associated genes [13]. Of importance, the PSA−/lo
LNCaP cells, compared to PSA+ cells, also overexpressed
some (e.g., EED, HDAC4, PHF8) whereas under-expressed
other (e.g., DNMT3B, PHF19) chromatin modifiers/
epigenetic regulators [13]. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are

in RPMI-7% CDSS plus either 1 nM or 10 nM R1881 for 25 days and plates were stained by Giemsa. Note that R1881 dose-dependently
‘overcame’ the CDSS effect and promoted the clonal expansion of PSA+ LNCaP cells. D. Apoptosis assessed by the Vybrant apoptosis assays.
Unsorted bulk LNCaP cells infected with PSAP-GFP lentiviral reporter were plated at 120 k cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were treated
for 4 days with either DMSO, 2% CDSS plus 20 μM Bicalutamide (CDSS/Bic), 20 nM Paclitaxel, 1 μM etoposide, or 1 μM H2O2. The %

PSA+ cells were plated (1,000/well) in 96-well plate in regular serum-containing medium containing Taxol (Docetaxel) or H2O2 for 48 h.
At the end of treatments, live cells were measured by MTT assays and cell survival normalized to vehicle control DMSO (which is 100%).

enriched in genes associated with bivalent chromatin marks
consisting of large regions of the repressive H3 lysine 27
trimethylation (H3K27me3) harboring smaller regions of H3
lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) [29]. To explore whether
PSA−/lo PCa cells may also be epigenetically different from
the differentiated isogenic PSA+ cells, we performed ChIP
and re-ChIP (also called ChIP and sequential ChIP) analysis
using the Bernstein protocol [30]. We purified PSA−/lo and
PSA+ LNCaP and LAPC9 cells and analyzed 8 genes whose
promoters have been associated with the bivalent marks in
ESCs [29] including FGF5, NKX3.1, BCL2, CDH2 (i.e.,
N-cadherin), CD61 (i.e., integrin β3), AR, ASCL1, and
PPP2R4. We first performed regular ChIP assays using rabbit
polyclonal antibodies to pan-histone 3 (panH3), H3K4me3,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or H3K27me3 in purified PSA+/PSA−/lo LNCaP (Figure 6A)
or LAPC9 (Figure 6B) cells. We then performed sequential
ChIP on the first ChIP products using a mAb to H3K27me3.
The results revealed that in LNCaP cells, 4 genes, i.e.,
NKX3.1, FGF5, BCL2, and CDH2 showed bivalent binding
patterns preferentially in the PSA−/lo cell population (Figure
6C). In contrast, the other 4 genes (i.e., CD61, ASCL1,
AR, and PPP2R4) showed overall similar re-ChIP profiles,
which did not differ significantly between PSA−/lo vs. PSA+
cells (Figure 6C; data not shown). In LAPC9 cells, 4 genes,
i.e., FGF5, BCL2, CDH2 and CD61 showed bivalent
binding patterns preferentially in PSA−/lo cells (Figure
6D) whereas NKX3.1 showed similarly low levels of
bivalency in both populations. The other 3 genes (ASCL1,

Systemic androgen regulates the abundance of PSA+ PCa cells in LAPC9 tumors. (A) The majority of PCa cells in LAPC9 reporter tumors
maintained in intact male NOD-SCID mice expressed nuclear AR, PSA, and GFP (the left panel; note less sensitive PSA staining than
corresponding GFP staining). When LAPC9 tumors in male mice were transferred to castrated mice, AR became excluded from nucleus
(which was expected due to lack of the ligand), PSA staining was reduced, and % GFP+ cells significantly decreased (right panels). (B)
Tumor cells in the LAPC9 reporter tumors maintained in castrated male mice showed dramatically reduced numbers of AR+ and PSA+, and
GFP+ cells (the left panel; note that in these tumors GFP sequence could be readily detected by PCR analysis of genomic DNA; not shown);
however, when the LAPC9 tumors in castrated mice were transferred back to intact male mice, many tumor cells again displayed nuclear
AR as well as PSA/GFP positivity (right panels). C. LAPC9 tumor cells were purified from a maintenance reporter tumor maintained
in intact male NOD/SCID mice). The bulk tumor cells contained ~72% GFP+ LAPC9 cells as assessed by FACS (i.e., at 0 month). Then
100,000 unsorted LAPC9 cells were injected subcutaneously, in 50% Matrigel, in intact male mice, castrated male mice (castrated ~2 weeks
earlier), or female mice (n = 4 for each), respectively. Two months after tumor cell implantation, tumors were harvested and the % of GFP+
cells in each tumor was determined by FACS. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, when compared to the tumors in male mice. D–E. Bulk LAPC9
cells purified from maintenance tumors in male (D) or castrated (E) mice were injected (200, 000 cells/injection) s.c in three different types

FGF5 mRNAs in PSA−/lo cells [13] and correspondingly,
our ChIP assays showed high H3K4me3 association with
the NKX3.1 and FGF5 gene promoters also in PSA−/lo cells
(Figure 6C), supporting the preferential activation of these
two genes in PSA−/lo LNCaP cells. These preliminary ChIP/
re-ChIP results provide evidence that the PSA−/lo and PSA+
PCa cells may possess different epigenetic profiles.

bivalent patterns between PSA−/lo vs. PSA+ LAPC9 cells
(data not shown). It is interesting that LNCaP and LAPC9
cells showed similar bivalent chromatin marks on 3 gene
promoters (i.e., FGF5, BCL2, and CDH2) but differed
in NKX3.1 and CD61. Also of interest, LNCaP cDNA
microarray analysis revealed higher levels of NKX3.1 and

Relationship between PSA−/lo PCa cells and other
tumorigenic PCa cell subsets

experiments in HPCa samples also revealed mutually
exclusive expression patterns between PSA versus the three
PCSC markers (Figure 7A). Differential quantification
demonstrated that α2β1+ (Figure 7B) and ALDH1A1+
(Figure 7C) cells were mainly PSA−/lo. Strikingly, when we
performed the opposite experiments by purifying out CD44+/
CD44− primary tumor cells from 12 untreated tumor samples
(Supplementary Table 2) and analyzing AR and PSA mRNAs
in the two populations, we found that the PSA mRNA was
preferentially expressed in CD44− HPCa cells in 10 samples
whereas AR mRNA expression pattern was more complex
with preferential enrichment in CD44− HPCa cells in only 6
samples (Figure 7D). In 4 samples, AR mRNA was actually
higher in CD44+ HPCa cells (Figure 7D).

In our previous studies, cDNA microarray analysis
revealed that the PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells expressed higher
mRNA levels of several CSC markers including CD44,
integrin α2β1, and ALDH1A1 in comparison to PSA+ LAPC9
cells [13]. Indeed, using PSA+/PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells freshly
purified from xenograft reporter tumors [13], we observed
lower levels of PSA and AR mRNAs (Supplementary Figure
5A) but higher levels of CD44 mRNA (Supplementary
Figure 5B) in PSA−/lo cells. Tumors initially derived from
PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells, even after 3 passages in intact male
mice, still expressed high levels of α2β1, CD44, and
ALDH1A1 proteins compared to similarly passaged tumors
initially derived from the PSA+ cells (Supplementary Figure
5C). These results suggest an opposite relationship between
PSA expression and the three phenotypic PCSC markers.
Indeed, double IF staining in benign prostate tissues showed
basal expression of CD44, ALDH1A1, and α2β1 but luminal
expression of PSA (Supplementary Figure 5D–5E). Similar

PCa cells expressing CSC markers CD44, α2β1, and
ALDH1A1. Unfortunately, primary HPCa cells, and
even primary HPCa pieces, are well-known to be very
difficult to regenerate tumors in immunocompromised
mice [11, 31]. Therefore, to further dissect the PCa cell
heterogeneity, in this part of the project, we employed
both surface markers (CD44, α2β1, and, for comparison,
ABCG2) and functional (i.e., SP and Aldefluor) assays to
dissect the tumorigenicity of PCa cell subpopulations in
three PSA− (Du145, PPC-1 and PC3; all three models do
not express AR and PSA and contain only PSA− cells) and

three PSA+ (LNCaP, LAPC4 and LAPC9; all 3 models
contain PSA+ and PSA−/lo cells) PCa models. It should be
noted that although we have previously reported tumorinitiating cells in some of these models [6–12], those
studies were conducted in by different investigators and
at different time points. Herein, we aim to conduct sideby-side, in-depth dissection of PCa cell heterogeneity in
the same models. We performed a spectrum of functional
assays in vitro and (serial) tumor transplantations by
implanting 1 to 5 × 105 cells in NOD/SCID mice followed
by determining and comparing the tumor-initiating

23969

frequency (TIF) of matched PCa cell subpopulations. As
we describe below, the results revealed distinct phenotypic
profiles of tumor-initiating cells in individual PCa models.
In vitro studies in the 4 PCa cell lines (LNCaP,
Du145, PPC-1 and PC3) showed (Supplementary Figure
6; Supplementary Table 3) that they all expressed the
luminal cell marker cytokeratin 18 (CK18) but only
LNCaP cells expressed the differentiation markers AR and
PSA. In contrast, the basal/stem cell markers CD44, α2β1,
and CK5 were not detected in LNCaP cells but observed
in a fraction of Du145 cells and expressed in the majority
of PC3 and PPC-1 cells. We also measured telomerase
activity in these cells, which mirrored the expression
pattern of basal/stem cell markers (Supplementary
Table 3). Interestingly, the clonogenic, tumorigenic, and
metastatic capacity of the 4 PCa cells positively correlated
with their telomerase activity and the abundance of basal/
stem cell markers.
Subsequently, we performed limiting-dilution
tumor-regeneration assays (LDA) in Du145 and PC3
cells, two surrogate PSA− PCa models, using both markerbased and functional assays (Table 1; Figure 8A–8E;
Supplementary Figure 7–8). Among the 3 single surface
marker (ABCG2, CD44, and α2β1) profiles, the ABCG2+
Du145 cell population (from either cultures or xenografts)
manifested significantly higher tumor-regenerating
activity than the ABCG2− population (Table 1). Consistent
with our earlier results (7), the CD44+ Du145 cells were
>30 fold more tumorigenic than the CD44− counterparts
(Table 1). The integrin α2β1+ Du145 cells were also
much more tumorigenic than the α2β1– Du145 cells
(Table 1; Supplementary Figure 7). Interestingly, when
we sorted out Du145 cells double positive for CD44 and
α2β1, there was only ~2 fold difference in TIF between
CD44+α2β1+ vs. CD44−α2β1− populations, which was
not statistically significant (Table 1; see below). In the
two functional (i.e., SP and Aldefluor) assays performed,
Du145 cells did not show a detectable SP (not shown),
as we previously reported [6]. In contrast, ~20% Du145
cells had high Aldefluor activity (i.e., ALDH+; Figure
8A; Supplementary Figure 8A). The ALDH+ Du145
cells demonstrated relatively higher clonogenic capacity
(Supplementary Figure 8B) and significantly higher
tumorigenicity (Supplementary Figure 8C; Table 1) than
ALDH− cells. In secondary (2°) tumor transplantation
experiments (Figure 8B), the ALDH+ Du145 cells purified
from the first generation (1°) tumors were greatly enriched
in tumor-regenerating activity giving rise to a striking TIF
of 1/1 (Figure 8C; Table 1), suggesting that nearly every
single ALDH+ cell was tumorigenic. ALDH+ Du145 cells
self-renewed in vivo as both the 1° (Supplementary Figure
8D) and 2° (not shown) tumors, like the parental cultures,
harbored only a fraction of ALDH+ cells with the majority
being ALDH−.
PC3 cells, unlike Du145, were nearly all positive
for CD44 and α2β1 (Supplementary Figure 6A;
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, these two surface
markers would not be able to stratify tumorigenic vs. nontumorigenic subsets. On the other hand, ~40% PC3 cells
were ALDH+ (Figure 8A; Supplementary Figure 8A) and
purified ALDH+ PC3 cells showed much higher clonal
(Figure 8D), sphere-formation (Figure 8E), and tumorregeneration (Table 1) capacities than the corresponding
ALDH− PC3 cells.
Next, we studied LAPC9 and LAPC4, two
xenograft models that contain both AR+/AR− and PSA+/
PSA− cells [13]. Unlike what we observed in Du145
cells, ABCG2+ and ABCG2− LAPC9 cells did not show
any difference in tumorigenic capacities (Table 2).
The α2β1+ and α2β1− LAPC9 cells, whether implanted
subcutaneously or in the DP, also did not manifest any
difference in tumor-regenerating activity (Table 2).
CD44+ LAPC9 cells, however, when implanted
subcutaneously or orthotopically in the dorsal prostate
(DP), exhibited ~6- and 19-fold, respectively, higher
tumor-initiating potential than corresponding CD44−
LAPC9 cells (Table 2). The higher tumor-initiating
capacity of CD44+ LAPC9 cells was corroborated in an
independent orthotopic LDA experiment (Supplementary
Figure 9A). Importantly, the in vivo self-renewal
ability of the CD44+ LAPC9 cells was revealed in 2°
transplantation experiments (Supplementary Figure 9B).
Remarkably, however, the CD44+α2β1+ LAPC9 cells,
unlike CD44+α2β1+ Du145 cells, demonstrated > 900
fold enrichment in tumor-initiating capacity compared
to the double-negative cells (Table 2). In fact, we even
observed tumor development with a single CD44+α2β1+
LAPC9 cell (Table 2; see discussion below). In the
two functional assays we performed, the LAPC9 SP
cells, as we observed earlier [6], constituted ~0.05–1%
of the total (not shown) and possessed much higher
tumor-initiating capacity than the non-SP cells (Table
2; Supplementary Figure 9C). Like the CD44+ and
CD44+α2β1+ cells, the LAPC9 SP cells self-renewed in
vivo and a single LAPC9 SP cell was able to establish
a 2° tumor (Supplementary Figure 9C and 9D). The
ALDH+ LAPC9 cells in regular AD tumors constituted
~10% of the total (Figure 8A; Supplementary Figure 8A)
and displayed higher sphere-forming (Supplementary
Figure 8E) and tumor-regenerating (Table 2) activities
than the corresponding ALDH− cells. Interestingly,
the ALDH+ LAPC9 cells purified from AI tumors,
which were enriched in ALDH+ cells (not shown), also
manifested higher sphere-forming capacity than ALDH−
cells (Figure 8F).
When we purified out CD44+/CD44− and α2β1+/α2β1−
LAPC4 cells from the xenografts and performed similar
LDA tumor experiments, surprisingly, the marker-positive
and marker-negative subpopulations appeared similarly
tumorigenic (Table 2). LAPC4 cells did not have a detectable
SP (data not shown) but had ~35% ALDH+ cells (Figure 8A;
Supplementary Figure 8A). The ALDH+ LAPC4 cells again

did not exhibit any difference in tumor-regenerating activity
compared to the ALDH− cells (Table 2; Supplementary
Figure 8F). If anything, the ALDH− LAPC4 cells appeared
to be slightly more tumorigenic than the ALDH+ cells
(Supplementary Figure 8F). However, CD44+α2β1+ LAPC4
cells displayed (statistically) higher tumor-regenerating
activity than the corresponding CD44−α2β1− LAPC4 cells
(Table 2; Supplementary Figure 10).

Supplementary Table 4) demonstrate that tumor-initiating
Du145 cells can be enriched by all three surface markers
(ABCG2, α2β1, and CD44) as well as Aldefluor assay but
not SP analysis as this model lacks the SP. Tumorigenic
LAPC9 cells can be enriched by CD44+, CD44+α2β1+, and
SP and ALDH+ phenotypes but not the α2β1+ or ABCG2+
phenotypes. Tumorigenic PC3 cells may be enriched by
the ALDH+ phenotype but not ABCG2 whereas only the
CD44+α2β1+ phenotype can enrich tumor-initiating cells
in the LAPC4 model (Supplementary Table 4). Serial
tumor transplantation experiments have established that
the Du145 ALDH+, and LAPC9 CD44+, CD44+α2β1+,
and SP populations all can self-renew in vivo, attesting
to their true CSC properties. These results, collectively,

fold changes (in log 2 ratio), centered at 0. For both Du145 and LAPC9, genes were presented from the highest to lowest in the CD44+

plated in Matrigel-coated 12-well plates (3,000 cells/well) and treated with 0 – 10 μM FGFR inhibitor SU5402. Colonies were enumerated
2 weeks after plating. H. Knocking down ABCG2 reduced sphere formation in CD44+ LAPC9 cells. Freshly purified CD44+ LAPC9 cells

were counted 2 weeks after plating.

CD44+ (1/21 vs 1/137; P = 0.0014) or α2β1+ (1/21 vs. 1/3,
759; P = 5.12e14) cell population (Table 1). The contrasting
results observed in Du145 and LAPC9 models with respect
to the tumorigenicity of CD44+α2β1+ cells suggest that the
ability of combinatorial marker-sorting strategy to further
enrich CSCs over single marker strategies is dependent on
the cancer model analyzed.
To further dissect PCSC heterogeneity at the
molecular level, we custom-made a RT2 Profiler™
qPCR Human Stem Cell Superarray that contained 84
stem cell-associated genes (Supplementary Table 5) and
analyzed their expression levels in CD44+, α2β1+, and/or
CD44+α2β1+ Du145 and LAPC9 cell populations (Figure
9A–9F; Supplementary Figure 11A–1B). The results
revealed several interesting findings. First, we observed
both overexpressed and downregulated genes in markerpositive in comparison to the corresponding markernegative populations in both models. Second, we observed
similarities as well as differences in gene expression both
between different subpopulations of cells in the same cell

suggest that different PCa models possess distinct profiles
of tumorigenic subpopulations.
To investigate the potential relationship between
single marker-positive versus double marker-positive PCa
cells with respect to their tumor-regenerating activity, we
compared CD44+α2β1+ versus CD44+ and α2β1+ cells in
Du145 and LAPC9 models. Interestingly, the CD44+α2β1+
Du145 cell population was only slightly enriched in tumorinitiating cells and its tumor-initiating capacity was actually
lower than in CD44+ Du145 cells (TIF 1/9, 152 vs. TIF
1/530, P = 1.27e-07) (Table 1). Also, the CD44+α2β1+
Du145 cells exhibited only ~2 fold higher tumorigenic
potential than CD44−α2β1− cells (1/9, 152 vs. 1/18, 963, P
= 0.343) (Table 1). In sharp contrast to the Du145 model,
the CD44+α2β1+ LAPC9 cells were highly tumorigenic in
that as few as 1 double-positive cell was able to regenerate a
tumor (Table 1) and the regenerated tumor contained only a
small % of CD44+α2β1+ LAPC9 cells and could be serially
passaged (not shown). Significantly, the CD44+α2β1+
LAPC9 cell population was more tumorigenic than either

mRNAs of ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 were not enriched
in the two CD44+ LAPC9 populations (Supplementary
Figure 11B) but the ALDH+ cells were nearly completely
encompassed in the CD44+ population of LAPC9 cells
(Supplementary Figure 12B), suggesting that other ALDH
isoform(s) might be involved in mediating the Aldefluor
phenotype in the LAPC9 model.
Finally, we employed lentiviral-mediated
knockdown to investigate the functions of CD44, integrin
α2, and ABCG2 in purified CD44+ Du145 and/or LAPC9
cells. CD44 knockdown did not affect the colony or
sphere formation in either model (Supplementary Figure
11D; data not shown). These results are consistent
with our earlier studies demonstrating that antiCD44 antibodies did not interfere with the clonal and
clonogenic properties of CD44+ PCa cells [7]. In contrast
to CD44, ABCG2 knockdown inhibited clonogenic
activities of both LAPC9 (Figure 9H; Supplementary
Figure 11E) and Du145 (not shown) CD44+ cells, which
is consistent with ABCG2 enrichment and also suggests
its functional significance in the two CD44+ PCa cell
populations. Interestingly, knocking down integrin α2
also strongly suppressed the clonogenicity of LAPC9
CD44+ cells (Supplementary Figure 11D).

type and between the same subpopulations of different PCa
cell types. For instance, the CD44+ Du145 cells displayed
a gene expression pattern that was overall different from
that in the α2β1+ Du145 cells (Figure 9A). Gene expression
patterns in CD44+ versus CD44+α2β1+ LAPC9 cells were
also dissimilar (Figure 9B). Third, the two subpopulations
from the same cell type, however, did share some gene
expression patterns. For example, the CD44+ and α2β1+
Du145 cells (Figure 9C) and the CD44+ and CD44+α2β1+
LAPC9 cells (Figure 9D) shared many overexpressed genes.
Fourth, the CD44+α2β1+ LAPC9 cells, which were among
the most tumorigenic and were more tumorigenic than
CD44+ LAPC9 cells (Table 2), showed more upregulated
genes (Figure 9B and 9D; Supplementary Figure 11A).
Among the most highly upregulated genes in CD44+α2β1+
LAPC9 cells were MME (CD10), CCNE1, COL2A1,
and those involved in Wnt signaling (FRAT1, BTRC,
APC, WNT1), growth factor signaling (FGFR1, IGF1,
BMP2, FGF4, NEUROG2), and pluripotency (SOX2)
(Supplementary Figure 11A). Many of these molecules are
well-known stem cell regulators and have been implicated
in PCa etiology and progression [e.g., 32–36].
The qPCR analysis provided clues about potential
involvement of certain signaling pathways in commonly
regulating several PCSC populations. For example, the
CD44+ Du145 and LAPC9 cell populations, both of
which were tumorigenic, shared 14 upregulated genes
including developmental (FGF1, FGFR1, and DVL1),
cell-cycle related (RB1, CDC2, CCND2, and CCNA2),
and neuronal (TUBB3 and NEUROG2) genes (Figure
9E–9F). As an example of interrogating the functional
significance of the signaling pathways, we treated freshly
purified CD44+ Du145 and LAPC9 cells with SU5402,
a specific FGFR inhibitor and then performed colony
formation assays in Matrigel and sphere formation assays
in ultra-low attachment (ULA) plates (6–13). SU5402
dose-dependently compromised colony (Figure 9G) and
sphere (Supplementary Figure 11C) forming capabilities
of both CD44+ PCa cell populations.
The qPCR results also provided clues about
potential relationships between different PCa cell
subpopulations. For instance, the CD44+ Du145 cell
population was enriched not only in CD44 mRNA
but also mRNAs of ABCG2 and two ALDH isoforms
(ALDH1A1 and ALDH2) and the α2β1+ Du145 cells
expressed high levels of CD44 and ALDH1A1 mRNAs
(Supplementary Figure 11B). These results suggest
that in the Du145 model, CD44+, α2β1+, ABCG2+, and
ALDH+ cell populations identify overlapping subsets of
tumorigenic cells, which is congruent with phenotypic
analysis (Supplementary Figure 12A). Similarly, in the
LAPC9 model, ABCG2 mRNA was enriched in both
CD44+ and CD44+α2β1+ cell populations (Supplementary
Figure 11B), again suggesting that these markers identify
overlapping cell populations as corroborated by the flow
analysis (Supplementary Figure 12B). Interestingly, the

Clonogenic and tumorigenic subpopulations in
untreated patient tumors
We showed earlier that untreated primary human PCa
(i.e., HPCa) contained CD44+, α2β1+, and ALDH1A1+ cells
that were mostly PSA−/lo (Figure 7; Supplementary Figure
5E). Here, we quantitatively analyzed the expression and,
importantly, potential functions of PCSC marker-positive
HPCa cells, i.e., CD44+, α2β1+, CD44+α2β1+, and ALDH+, as
well as CD133 [15] in a large cohort (~50) of HPCa samples
(Figure 10; Supplementary Figure 13; Supplementary Table
2). The majority of the HPCa samples we examined (44/46,
96%) contained CD44+ cells, although the percentages varied
widely (Figure 10A; Supplementary Table 2). When CD44+
HPCa cells, which were all negative for AR and PSA proteins
(Supplementary Figure 13A) as we previously observed [8,
37, 38], were purified out, plated on fibroblast feeders or
collagen, and analyzed for their proliferative potential, we
observed higher population doublings (PDs) for the CD44+
cell population than CD44− population in HPCa41 (Figure
10Ba), HPCa43 (Figure 10Bb), HPCa44 (Figure 10Bc),
HPCa50 (Supplementary Figure 13C), and HPCa51 (not
shown) samples. In fact, most HPCa44 (Figure 10Bc) and
HPCa50 (Supplementary Figure 13C) CD44− cells initially
attached but did not proliferate and soon died off whereas
the corresponding CD44+ cells expanded exponentially,
suggesting that the CD44+ HPCa cells also possess greater
survival advantage. On the other hand, as we observed in the
xenograft systems, not all patient-derived CD44+ HPCa cells
manifested higher proliferative potential than their CD44−
counterparts (e, g., Supplementary Figure 13D).

cells were acutely MACS-purified from the patient tumor (GS8) and co-injected, at the indicated cell numbers, with 100k Hs5 cells in 50%
Matrigel s.c into irradiated NOD/SCID-γ mice. The 10k and 100k tumors were harvested at ~4 months whereas 100 and 1k tumors were
harvested at 7 months after implantation. Shown on the right are the TIF for the two populations and the P value for TIF comparison.

shown). Importantly, in a pilot in vivo experiment, we
purified out CD44+/CD44− cells from HPCa52 (GS8) and
co-injected them, at increasing cell numbers, with the Hs5
mesenchymal cells [31], subcutaneously in irradiated male
NOD/SCID-γ mice supplemented with the exogenous
testosterone. As shown in Figure 10D, the CD44+ HPCa52
cells demonstrated higher tumor-regenerating capacity than
corresponding CD44− cells. This was quite a remarkable
finding for the bulk primary HPCa cells are known to be
extremely indolent in tumor regeneration [11, 31].

We also compared the clonogenic potential of CD44+/
CD44 HPCa cells by plating them, at clonal density, in
Matrigel in several variations of serum-free medium. The
results revealed significantly higher sphere-forming ability
of the CD44+ cells from HPCa50 (not shown) and HPCa51
(Figure 10C) than the respective CD44− HPCa cells. The
above clonal and clonogenic assays indicate that primary
CD44+ HPCa cells possess certain stem/progenitor cell
properties, which was supported by the expression of stem
cell marker hTERT (Supplementary Figure 13A; data not

HPCa also expressed other PCSC markers including
CD133 [15]. In general, the % of CD133+ HPCa cells was
lower than that of CD44+ HPCa cells (Supplementary
Figure 13E; Supplementary Table 2). The CD133+ LAPC4
(Supplementary Figure 13F) and HPCa (Supplementary
Figure 13G–13H) cells showed higher proliferative and
sphere-forming potential than the corresponding CD133−
cells. Interestingly, in a pilot study we observed higher
CD44 and integrin α2 mRNA levels in CD133+ HPC40
cells than the corresponding CD133− cells (Supplementary
Figure 13I), suggesting a potentially overlapping
relationship among the 3 subpopulations in HPCa samples.
Together, these results suggest that untreated
primary tumors contain subsets of HPCa cells that express
the phenotypic markers of PCSCs and possess enhanced
clonal, clonogenic, and even tumorigenic potential.

becomes strikingly enriched in all CRPC samples examined
and in castration-resistant xenograft model. These analyses,
taken together with evidence of distinct epigenetic profiles
of PSA−/lo vs. PSA+ subsets, suggest that castration selects
for undifferentiated PSA−/lo PCa cells.
Our previous work has demonstrated that the PSA−/lo
PCa cell population harbors self-renewing long-term tumorpropagating PCSCs that resist castration [13]. The present
study follows up on the earlier work by further showing
that the PSA−/lo PCa cells are much more quiescent than
the PSA+ cells, based on time-lapse tracking of single
cells and clonal analysis. Purified PSA−/lo PCa cells, like
the bulk AR−PSA−/lo LNCaP subline, are also refractory to
antiandrogens and other drugs. We further demonstrate that
the relative abundance of both PSA−/lo and PSA+ PCa cells
in tumors are regulated dynamically by systemic androgen
levels, which in turn impacts tumor regeneration and growth
in androgen-proficient versus androgen-deficient conditions.
These latter observations implicate differential epigenetic
mechanisms in regulating the two populations of PCa
cells. In support, targeted ChIP/re-ChIP assays on 8 gene
promoters known to be associated with bivalent chromatin
domains in ES cells reveal 4 genes possessing bivalent
features but preferentially in PSA−/lo PCa cells, consistent
with these cells possessing stem cell gene expression
profiles and biological characteristics [13]. A genome-wide
ChIP-Seq analysis of several histone marks in purified
PSA−/lo and PSA+ PCa cells is under way.
The PSA−/lo PCSC population is heterogeneous [13].
Therefore, in the second part of this project, we carried out
exhaustive tumor-regeneration and serial transplantation
studies in 2 AR+/PSA+ (LAPC9 and LAPC4) and 2 AR−/
PSA− (PC3 and Du145) PCa models. The results provide
indisputable evidence that 1) different PCa models possess
distinct profiles of tumorigenic subpopulations; 2), some PCa
(e.g., LAPC9 and Du145) may possess several populations
of CSCs whereas others (e.g., LAPC4) seem to have a
paucity of CSC populations; 3) no single marker profile can
track tumor-propagating cells in all models; and 4) the ability
of combinatorial marker-sorting strategy to further enrich
CSCs over single marker strategies is dependent on the
cancer models analyzed (Supplementary Table 2). Therefore,
the CD44+ phenotype enriches CSCs in Du145 and LAPC9
but not in LAPC4 models whereas the ALDH+ phenotype
enriches tumor-initiating cells in all 4 models except
LAPC4. Similarly, the CD44+α2β1+ phenotype enriches
CSCs in LAPC9 and LAPC4 but not in Du145 models.
These results provide essential foundation for understanding
CSC heterogeneity [1, 2] and also explanations to why
different groups, working on individual PCa models, have
often reported divergent PCSC phenotypes.
That tumorigenic subpopulations can be enriched by
several different markers and functional strategies implies
that some tumors contain a CSC pool with heterogeneous
tumorigenic subsets that possess distinct tumor-initiating
and tumor-propagating properties. In support, the LAPC9

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the present study represents the
most comprehensive efforts to dissect the phenotypic,
functional, and tumorigenic heterogeneities in human PCa
cells using multiple xenograft models and > 70 patient
tumor samples. In the first part, we further investigate the
PSA−/lo PCa cell population, which we have recently shown
to harbor self-renewing long-term tumor-propagating
cells [13]. We demonstrate that 1) tumor cell PSA mRNA
levels inversely correlate with grade, metastasis, and
patient survival; 2) discordant AR and PSA expression
in both untreated and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC)
results in AR+PSA+, AR+PSA−, AR−PSA−, and AR−PSA+
subtypes of PCa cells that manifest differential sensitivities
to therapeutics; 3) the PSA−/lo PCa cells pre-exist in
untreated primary tumors and castration leads to a great
enrichment of PSA−/lo PCa cells in both xenograft tumors
and CRPC samples; 4) the PSA−/lo PCa cells are quiescent
and resistant to castration and other stress treatments; 5)
systemic androgen levels dynamically regulate the relative
abundance of PSA+ versus PSA−/lo PCa cells in the tumors
that impacts the kinetics of tumor growth; 6) the PSA−/lo
PCa cells seem to possess distinct epigenetic profiles; and 7)
the PSA−/lo PCa cell population is enriched in several CSC
markers including CD44, integrin α2β1, and ALDH1A1.
Heterogeneous and discordant AR and PSA
expression in PCa cells has been reported in numerous
earlier studies [39–61]; however, our study, for the first
time, has proposed and presented the evidence for the 4
subtypes of PCa cells, i.e., AR+PSA+, AR−PSA+, AR+PSA−,
and AR−PSA+ that pre-exist in untreated HPCa. We have
shown preliminary evidence that 3 LNCaP sublines
representing 3 subtypes of PCa cells, i.e., AR+PSA+ (regular
LNCaP), AR+PSA− (LNCaP-abl) and AR−PSA− (LNCaPCDSS and LNCaP-MDV) exhibit differential responses
to antiandrogens, chemodrugs, and targeted therapeutics.

encompasses both AR+PSA−/lo and AR+PSA−/lo cells,

model harbors tumorigenic subpopulations that can be
prospectively enriched using CD44+ and CD44+α2β1+
profiles as well as the SP and ALDH assays with the
CD44+α2β1+ subpopulation being the most tumorigenic (i.e.,
~1 tumor-initiating cell in every 20 cells; Table 2). Detailed
phenotypic and molecular profiling in Du145 and LAPC9
models shows that the CD44+, α2β1+, ABCG2+, and ALDH+
cell populations identify overlapping subsets of tumorinitiating cells. Functional interrogation demonstrates that
integrin α2 and ABCG2 but not CD44 are causally important
for the clonal and clonogenic properties of the CD44+ PCa
cells. The results with CD44 suggest that the molecule
probably regulates PCSC properties in some other ways.
Indeed, we have recently shown that CD44 plays a critical
role in facilitating the invasive and metastatic behavior
of PCSCs [12]. Of significance, the tumorigenic CD44+
cell populations in both Du145 and LAPC9 commonly
upregulate 14 genes involved in development (FGF1,
FGFR1, and DVL1), cell cycle (RB1, CDC2, CCND2, and
CCNA2), and neuronal activity (TUBB3 and NEUROG2),
providing potential therapeutic targets for the CD44+ PCa
cells. Similar molecular profiling reveals genes preferentially
expressed in the most tumorigenic CD44+α2β1+ LAPC9
cells including Wnt (FRAT1, BTRC, APC, WNT1), growth
factor (FGFR1, IGF1, BMP2, FGF4, NEUROG2), and
pluripotency (SOX2) signaling molecules. As a proof of
principle, an FGFR inhibitor potently blocks the clonal and
clonogenic activity in CD44+ LAPC9 and Du145 cells.
Our observations in PCa are consistent with the
phenotypic heterogeneity and functional diversity of CSCs
recently reported in other tumor systems including cancers
of the breast, pancreas, and colon as well as acute myeloid
leukemia and glioblastoma [1, 2, 25, 62–67]. Our results
also support but greatly extend earlier efforts in using CD
antigen phenotyping to study PCa cell heterogeneity [68].
Importantly, phenotypic analysis combined with functional
studies in ~50 HPCa samples demonstrate that untreated
HPCa samples also heterogeneously express CSC markers
including CD44, CD133, α2β1, and ALDH and that
prospectively purified CD44+ and CD133+ HPCa cells in
most (though not all) samples manifest high proliferative,
clonal and clonogenic capacities.
Results from the present study reinforce the intrinsic
stem cell nature and castration-resistant properties of the
PSA−/lo PCa cells. Then what is the relationship between the
PSA−/lo PCa cell population and several other populations
of PCSCs including CD44+, α2β1+ and ALDH+ PCa cells?
IF staining combined with molecular profiling indicate that
the 3 CSC marker-positive populations of PCa cells are
included in the PSA−/lo population (Figure 7; Supplementary
Figure 5). The current work, together with our systematic
studies published over the past 10 years [6–13] allows us
to propose a hypothetical model that unifies most previous
PCSC studies (Figure 11). The model posits that untreated
prostate tumors contain a spectrum of cancer cells at different
stages of differentiation. Undifferentiated (PSA−/lo) PCa cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are quiescent and can undergo ACD to generate PSA+ cells
whereas the PSA+ PCa cells are highly proliferative but only
undergo SCD (Figure 11). The PSA−/lo PCa cells possess
unlimited whereas PSA+ PCa cells limited tumor-propagating
activity [13]. The PSA−/lo PCa cells are intrinsically more
resistant to castration and other therapeutics than PSA+ cells
[this study; 13]. Importantly, the PSA−/lo PCa cell population
is heterogeneous harboring and/or overlapping with other
tumorigenic subsets including the SP, holoclones, and
ALDH+, CD44+, α2β1+, and ABCG2+ cells [6–8, 10, 12,
13; this study] (Figure 11) and, likely, other subsets such
as CD133+ [15] and TRA-1–60+CD151+CD166+ cells [19],
which are AR−PSA−.
Our model (Figure 11) also provides a framework for
understanding PCa cell heterogeneity and potential cell-oforigin to CRPC. Therefore, untreated primary HPCa, like
LNCaP, LAPC9, and LAPC4 xenografts, all contain a major
population of PSA+ cells but also a minor PSA−/lo population,
in which tumorigenic subsets differ both quantitatively
and qualitatively depending on individual HPCa samples
and xenograft models. Due to the nearly homogeneous
AR expression in PSA+ PCa cells (Supplementary Figure
4A; 13), primary HPCa and AD xenografts respond well
to antiandrogens, leading to prominent reduction in tumor
burden. On the other hand, the PSA−/lo PCa cells, being
only ~30% AR+, do not respond well to antiandrogens
and will survive ADT leading to the eventual emergence
of CRPC. In support, the PSA−/lo PCa cells from multiple
PCa models regenerate AI tumors very efficiently in
completely androgen-deficient hosts [13]. Significantly,
more tumorigenic subsets can be further purified out from
the PSA−/lo PCa cell population to establish CRPC [13; Chen
et al., manuscript submitted]. These observations implicate
the PSA−/lo PCa cell population, which pre-exists in primary
HPCa, as a cell-of-origin for CRPC due to their preferential
survival of castration. This conjecture is fully consistent
with classical studies performed decades ago reporting that
CRPC might result from selective outgrowth of pre-existent
AI clones in primary tumors [69, 70]. In contrast to the
untreated HPCa and AD xenografts, the cellular landscape
in clinical CRPC and AI xenografts completely changes with
the PSA−/lo cells becoming predominant [this study, 13]. The
profiles of tumorigenic subsets within the PSA−/lo PCSC pool
may also likely to change (Figure 11). Taken together, the
current study further highlights the need to develop novel
therapeutics that specifically target the PSA−/lo population
and other PCSC subsets within, which when used in
combination with ADT, should help prevent tumor relapse.
Many of our ongoing projects are fulfilling this need.

Figure 11: A hypothetical model of tumorigenic heterogeneity of human PCa cells. Untreated (hormone-naïve) PCa contain

a spectrum of tumor cells at different stages of differentiation (marked by cells of varying colors and sizes). The PCSC pool in these
tumors mainly contains undifferentiated (PSA−/lo) PCa cells, which are quiescent (thus low proliferative index; below) and can undergo
ACD developing into differentiated cells. The PSA−/lo PCa cells possess long-term tumor-propagating activity. The PSA−/lo PCSC pool is
heterogeneous harboring and/or overlapping with other tumorigenic subsets that can be prospectively purified out using the marker profiles
indicated. The PCSC pool contains the intrinsically castration-resistant cells. In contrast, fully differentiated (PSA+) PCa cells, despite
being highly proliferative (thus high proliferative index, below), only undergo symmetric cell division and possess more limited tumorpropagating capabilities. The PSA−/lo PCSC pool is relatively small and preexists in untreated patient tumors but dramatically enriched in
CRPC in which the profiles of tumorigenic subsets may likely be very different from those in the untreated tumors. This model is updated
from our earlier model (8). See Text for more discussions.

each slide for counting by two individuals in a blind fashion
and PSA+ and PSA−/lo PCa cells were averaged.
For PSA and AR double IF staining, HPCa sections
(4 μm) were deparaffinized and dehydrated through graded
alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed by soaking slides
in pre-warmed target retrieve agent (S1099, Dakocytomation)
in boiling water bath (40 min). Slides were incubated with
Background Sniper (BS966H, Biocare Medical) at room
temperature for 30 min. For primary antibody staining,
slides were incubated at 4°C overnight with a mix of mouse
monoclonal anti-AR (clone 411, SC-7305, Santa Cruz
Technology; 1:50) and rabbit polyclonal anti-PSA (A0526,
Carpinteria, CA; 1:5) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 5%
goat serum. After thorough washing, slides were incubated
at RT for 60 min with secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), i.e.,
Alexa Flour 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) and
Alexa Flour 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) in
PBS plus 0.1% Triton and 5% serum, followed by thorough
washing. Then slides were incubated with DAPI (3 μM)
diluted in PBS (RT for 5 min). To eliminate autofluorescence,
slides were immersed in 70% ethanol for 5 min, incubated
in Autofluorescence Eliminator Reagent (2160, Millipore)
for 5 min, and were finally passed through 3 changes of
70% ethanol for 1 min each. Upon rinsing in PBS, slides
were mounted with 10 μL Gold Antifade Reagent (936590,
Prolong). Images were acquired on an Olympus microscope.

Xenograft tumor processing and purification of
human PCa cells from xenografts
Basic procedures were detailed elsewhere [11].
Briefly, xenograft tumors were harvested from maintenance
tumors and minced into ~1 mm3 pieces, which were
rinsed once with PBS, digested for 30 min with Accumax
(AM105; Innovative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA) at
room temperature, and filtered though 40-μm cell strainer.
Dead cells and debris were separated from live cells on a
discontinuous Percoll gradient. Lineage-positive mouse
cells were depleted using either MACS Lineage Cell
Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) or staining for mousespecific MHC using PE or Biotin-conjugated monoclonal
anti-H-2Kd (SF1–11; BD Biosciences).

Regular immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
and double immunofluorescence (IF) staining
of AR and PSA in formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) HPCa sample
Basic IHC protocols have been described [12, 13].
Paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized and
hydrated in xylene followed dehydration in graded alcohols
to water. Antigen retrieval was performed in 1.0 mM EDTA
Buffer (pH 8.0) for 10 min in a microwave oven followed
by a 20-min cool down. Slides were then incubated with
various primary antibodies followed by Envision-plus
labeled polymer-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and
DAB monitoring staining development (Dako). For IHC
analysis of PSA+ and PSA−/lo cells in FFPE HPCa sections,
we first titrated the primary antibody to PSA (A0526,
Dako) and found that at 1:5 dilutions, the antibody reliably
differentiated the PSA+ and PSA−/lo PCa cells. We then
utilized this antibody concentration to stain FFPE sections
[13]. In general we stained at least 3 consecutive sections
from each sample for PSA. Twelve fields were chosen from

Primary prostate tumor (HPCa) processing
Our lab has so far worked on >220 HPCa samples and
the present study utilized >70 HPCa samples (Supplementary
Table 2). All HPCa samples (with the matched normal/benign
samples) were obtained with the written informed consent
from the patients in accordance with federal and institutional
guidelines and with the approved IRB protocols (MDACC
LAB04–0498). HPCa processing protocol has been described
previously [11–13]. Lineage-positive (i.e., hematopoietic,
endothelial, smooth muscle, fibroblast, and other stromal)
cells were depleted using the MACS Lin-1 cocktail mix
and anti-CD140b-PE (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified HPCa cells

were used in multiple types of experiments and, in some
cases, for infection with the PSAP-GFP lentiviral vector.
When necessary, HPCa cells were cultured for a short period
time in various media, e.g., serum/androgen-free PrEBM
supplemented with insulin, EGF, and bovine pituitary extract.

ml insulin (I-6634, Sigma). PCa cells were suspended in
ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing ALDH substrate
(1 μM per 1 × 106 cells, the ALDEFLUOR kit; StemCell
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and incubated for 40
min at 37°C and sorted by FACS. As negative control, we
added 50 nmol/l diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) to
the cell suspension.

Tumor experiments and serial tumor
transplantation in NOD/SCID mice

Clonal and clonogenic sphere-formation assays

Subcutaneous (s.c) and orthotopic (i.e., dorsal
prostate or DP) tumor transplantations were carried out
as previously described [6–8, 11–13]. For serial tumor
transplantations in NOD/SCID mice, marker-positive
and -negative PCa cells were sorted out by FACS from
the first-generation (1°) tumors originally derived from
corresponding marker-positive and –negative cells, and
implanted s.c or in the DP to generate secondary (2°)
tumors. Sequential tumor transplantation was performed
using similar strategies. For tumor experiments in castrated
mice, male NOD/SCID mice (6–8 weeks) were surgically
castrated 1–2 weeks prior to tumor cell injection.

Holoclone and sphere-formation assays were
conducted as previously described [10, 11] and stringent
conditions were employed to ensure that clones, colonies,
and spheres were all derived from single cells [12]. Briefly,
we performed clonal analysis using purified and/or sorted
PCa cells plated at 100 cells/10-cm plate or 100 cells/well in
a six-well culture dish. Clones with ≥50 cells were scored ~2
weeks after plating. We performed LAPC9 clonal analysis
on mitomycin C (M0530, Sigma) treated Swiss 3T3 cells.
The results were expressed as cloning efficiency (%). In
some clonal assays, cells were directly sorted into 96-well
plates at 1 cell/well and clonal type and size were monitored
and scored under a (fluorescence) microscope [10, 11]. For
clonogenic sphere-formation assays in xenograft and HPCa
cells, cells were plated at 5,000–10,000 cells/well in six-well
culture dishes coated with a thin layer of 1% solidified agar or
50% Matrigel or plated in 6-well ultra-low attachment (ULA)
plates. Spheres that arose within 1–2 weeks were presented
as clonogenicity (%). For serial sphere-formation assays, the
first-generation spheres were harvested, disaggregated with
0.025% trypsin/EDTA, triturated with a 27-G needle, filtered
through 40-μm mesh, and replated as above. This process was
repeated for up to 4–5 generations. We sometimes performed
serial clonogenic assays in a different way. Briefly, cells were
first resuspended in DMEM/F12 supplemented with B27
(17504–044, Invitrogen) and N2 (17502–048, Invitrogen)
and mixed (7:4) thoroughly with methylcellulose (04100,
Stem Cell Technology) and plated (600 μl) in 24-well ULA
plates at 2, 000 cells/wells. Primary spheres were scored in
~2 weeks. For secondary sphere assays, the first-generation
spheres were individually picked up with a transfer pipette
under a dissection microscope and dissociated with 0.05%
trypsin/EDTA. All the cells derived from individual spheres
were mixed with methylcellulose and plated back to one well
of a 96-well ULA plate.

Lentiviral infection of PCa cells
Lentivirus was produced in 293FT packaging cells
and titers determined using GFP positivity in HT1080
cells. PCa cells were infected, generally, at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 20 and harvested at 48–72 h
post-infection. Infected bulk cells or FACS-purified
subpopulation of cells were used in various in vitro and in
vivo experiments detailed in each Figure.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
PCa cells stained for various markers or after PSAPGFP infection (48–72 h) were dissociated into single-cell
suspension and generally 1–10 × 106 cells were used for
FACS on a BD FACSAria™ Fusion cell sorter. Unstained
or uninfected cells were used as negative control for
gating. Post-sort analysis was routinely performed to
guarantee the purity of each population. HPCa cells
freshly purified from primary tumors were first infected
with PSAP-GFP and sorted 3–7 days later. To purify
marker-positive PCa cells from xenograft tumors, we first
incubated PCa cells with FcR blocking agent (Miltenyi
Biotec) for 15 min at 4°C and then stained them with
various primary antibodies. For double or triple marker
populations, we would incubate cells with anti-α2β1
(MAB1998Z; Chemicon) for 30 min on ice followed
by staining with APC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(550826; BD Biosciences) for 15 min on ice. Cells were
then washed (3x) and stained with PE-conjugated antiCD44 antibody (550932, BD Bioscience) and biotinylated
mouse H2-Kd (553564, BD Pharmingen) for 20 min.
After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Flour
405-conjugated streptavidin for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were
incubated in solution containing 1% BSA and 2.5 μg/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Clonogenic assays in CD44+ PCa cells treated
with FGFR inhibitor or with gene knockdowns
Du145 and LAPC9 cells were incubated with PEconjugated anti-CD44 (BD Biosciences; 1:10 dilution) for
1 h at 4°C. Cells were washed and resuspended in sorting
buffer, and the CD44+ (top 20%) population was sorted
out by FACS (see above). For shRNA (CD44, integrin α2,
and ABCG2) infection, 1 × 105 sorted cells were plated in
a 12-well plate in PrEBM media supplemented with B27,
23980

Oncotarget

10 μM EGF, 10 μM FGF, 8 μg polybrene and infected with
individual shRNA lentiviral vectors (MOI 20). After 48 h,
2 × 103 cells were plated per well in a 6-well ULA plate in
complete PrEBM media and incubated for 2 weeks before
scoring. Alternatively, cells were resuspended in a 1:1
ratio of Matrigel:PrEBM media mix and 3 × 103 cells per
well were plated around the rim in a 12-well plate. After
the Matrigel solidified, 2 ml of complete PrEBM media
was added to wells and cells were incubated for 2 weeks
before scoring. For treatment with the FGFR inhibitor
SU5402, CD44+ cells were plated in both Matrigel and
ULA plates immediately after sorting as described above
with the indicated SU5402 concentrations.

were analyzed by FACS at 2–5 days after the initiation of
treatments. Healthy live cells were identified as Annexin V
dim and PI negative; apoptotic cells Annexin V positive and
PI low/-; and necrotic cells Annexin V bright and PI bright.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Basic protocols for qRT-PCR have been described
[12, 13]. In brief, qRT-PCR was performed using an
ABI Prism 7900HT and the TaqMan system (ABI;
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; http://www.
appliedbiosystems.com). The primers, probes, and assay
conditions for other molecules were designed by ABI with
the following information: PSA (Hs03063374_m1; assay
number), AR (Hs00907244_m1), β-actin (Hs99999903_
ml), CD44 (Hs00153304_m1), α2 integrin (Hs00158148_
m1), and GAPDH (4326317E).

Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy
Basic IF procedures have been described [6–8]. To
correlate GFP and AR expression in LNCaP cells, GFP+
and GFP−/lo cells were sorted out by FACS and plated on
the glass coverslips overnight. Cells were stained using a
monoclonal antibody to AR (clone 441) followed by goat
anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594. For Ki-67
staining, cells were sorted out via FACS and plated on the
glass coverslips for 8 h. Cells were then incubated with the
rabbit mAb to Ki-67 (Abcam; 1:1000) for 60 min at room
temperature. Following thorough washing for 3 times with
PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 60 min at room
temperature with Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:1000). In some experiments, freshly purified
CD44+ HPCa cells were plated on collagen-coated glass
coverslips and cultured in PrEBM media supplemented with
B27, 10 μM EGF, 10 μM FGF, and BPE overnight followed
by IF labeling for CD44, α2β1, AR, PSA, and hTERT.

Time-lapse videomicroscopy and estimate of
cell-cycle transit time
Purified GFP+ and GFP− LNCaP cells were plated
on special glass-bottom dishes, placed on the incubator
stage of Nikon Biostation Timelapse system [13], and
maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2 and >95% humidity in
the RPMI medium supplemented with 7% FBS. Phase
and GFP images were collected continuously with a
20X objective lens at a 1-h interval for up to ~1 week.
Data analysis was performed using Nikon NIS-Elements
software. Several dozens of recorded GFP+ and GFP−
images were analyzed in detail for cell-cycle transit times
using the first cell division as the starting point.

Cell cycle and cell death analyses

Correlating PSA mRNA levels with clinical
outcomes of PCa patients in Oncomine

To determine the cell-cycle profiles, regular PCa cells
or PSAP-GFP infected cells were plated in 3.5-cm culture
dish at 30% confluence and harvested at ~60% confluence,
fixed in 0.5% PFA for 1 h at 4°C, and then permeabilized
in 70% cold ethanol at 4°C for 3 h. Cells were incubated in
propidium iodide (PI) working solution (40 μg/ml, P4170;
Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min and analyzed by FACS for cellcycle profiles [11, 13]. To determine differential sensitivities
of the PSA−/lo and PSA+ PCa cell populations to various
drug treatments, we performed FACS analysis using the
Vybrant Apoptosis Kit (catalog #V23200; Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) according to the manufacturern’s instructions.
The kit contained biotin-Annexin V, Alexa Fluor 350 (similar
spectrum to DAPI) streptavidin, and PI. Briefly, LNCaP
cells infected with the PSAP-GFP reporter construct were
plated in 10-cm cell culture plates at 500, 000 cells per plate.
Cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle control), etoposide
(25 μM), paclitaxel (10 nM), CDSS plus bicalutamide (20
μM) or H2O2 (10 μM) for various time intervals with fresh
drugs added every 1–2 days. Treated cells and controls

A total of 27 Oncomine PCa data sets containing
KLK3 mRNA expression data (Supplementary Table 2)
were analyzed in detail for correlations with available
patient parameters including survival, recurrence,
metastasis, Gleason score, serum PSA levels, and LN
status. Significance of PSA mRNA between conditions
was determined by Student’s t-test, and P values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant. Box plot
data presentations and statistical analyses were generated
using program R. We also performed survival analysis
and generated Kaplan-Meier survival plots using the
survival package in R. Briefly, we first input the individual
normalized gene expression data from patients with both
survival time and survival status from Oncomine and
ranked the data according to PSA mRNA expression. We
then assigned the samples with rankings from the first
quartile to the third quartile into two groups and compared
the P-value between these two groups along with different
cutoffs. Finally, we set the ultimate cutoff with the smallest
P-value and plotted a Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

Determination and GO analysis of genes
commonly upregulated in both LNCaP and
LAPC9 cDNA microarrays

chromatin samples without antibody, as a pre-clearing
step to reduce background due to non-specific chromatin
interaction with the beads. Beads used for pre-clearing
were then discarded. The other half of the beads were
incubated with antibodies for ChIP while pre-clearing
was ongoing. The following day, IP’s were performed by
combining pre-cleared chromatin samples with antibodybead complexes and incubating overnight at 4°C with
gentle rocking. The next day, the beads were washed
3 × 5 min. with ChIP wash buffer (0.1% SDS 1% Triton
X-100 2 mM EDTA 150 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH8) and the bound chromatin eluted by incubating the
beads with 450 μl of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate, 20
mM DTT for 15 min. at RT. 50 μl of each ChIP was
removed for use as input before incubating the IP eluate
with the re-ChIP antibody. Re-ChIPs were performed
by incubating the eluted chromatin from the first round
of ChIP with the H3K27 (trimethyl) mAb/bead mixture
overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. The re-ChIP’ed
chromatin was washed 3× for 5 min. in ChIP wash buffer
and then eluted by incubation with 450 μl of 100 mM
sodium bicarbonate, 1% SDS for 15 min at RT. Prior to
use in PCR reactions to detect the immunoprecipitated
DNA, all samples and inputs were subjected to cross-link
reversal by addition of 5 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K
and incubation at 60°C overnight. Protein was removed
from ChIP samples and inputs by phenol-chloroform
extraction and alcohol precipitation, and inputs were
resuspended in 100 μl of ddH2O while samples were
resuspended in 30 μl ddH2O. PCR was typically
performed for 33 cycles with 1 min. for extension and
30 seconds for denaturing and annealing steps with a
5-minute final extension. Promega GoTaq 2X master mix
was used for all reactions. ChIP primers were targeted
to sequences approximately 1000 bp from the TSS
(transcription start site) and were as follows:

We previously performed cDNA microarrays in
PSA−/lo versus PSA+ LNCaP and LAPC9 cells [13] and all
microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query) under the
accession number GSE15411 and GSE30114. To determine
commonly changed genes, we first selected the genes (by
Agilent’s Probe ID) either up-regulated or down-regulated
using a 1.4FC cutoff from both LAPC9 and LNCaP gene
lists (from raw data file) and used these genes for Venn
diagram analysis. This analysis identified 3,949 and 3,338
upregulated probe ID’s in PSA−/lo LAPC9 and LNCaP cells,
respectively, over the corresponding PSA+ cells, of which
570 probe ID’s were shared (see Supplementary Figure 4B).
The probe ID’s were then converted into official gene names
(symbols) using the ID conversion tool available in DAVID,
which identified a total 337 genes commonly upregulated in
both LNCaP and LAPC9 PSA−/lo populations. We performed
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of 337 commonly upregulated
genes using functional annotation tool in DAVID.

ChIP and re-ChIP assays
To determine if PSA−/lo and PSA+ tumor cells differed
in chromatin composition and stem-cell associated bivalent
domains, ChIP and re-ChIP assays [30] were performed
using chromatin from prospectively purified PSA−/lo and
PSA+ LAPC9 and LNCaP cells. Freshly sorted PSA−/lo
and PSA+ cells were fixed for 15 min at RT by addition of
freshly prepared neutral buffered formalin to their respective
media at a final concentration of 0.75%, with gentle rocking.
Formalin was quenched by the addition of 2 M glycine to
a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubation for 5 min
at RT with gentle rocking. Cells were then pelleted and
resuspended in 750 μl of ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPESKOH, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X100,
0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and Roche complete protease
inhibitor cocktail) for every million cells, and sonicated on
ice until the majority of the chromatin had been sheared into
500–1000 bp fragments. 50 μl was removed for use as input,
and the remaining chromatin was divided into aliquots for
immunoprecipitation (IP) and diluted 10x with dilution buffer
(1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail).
In all immunoprecipitations, 5 μg of primary
antibody or control IgG was used for the initial ChIP as
well as re-ChIPs performed. Antibodies used in the initial
ChIP were ChIP-grade rabbit control IgG, anti-Histone
H3, anti-Histone H3K4 (trimethyl), and anti-Histone
H3K27 (trimethyl). For the re-ChIP, a mouse monoclonal
antibody raised against histone H3K27 (trimethyl) was
used. For each ChIP antibody, 60 μl of Invitrogen Dynal
beads were washed and blocked in PBS-0.1% BSA.
Half of the beads were incubated overnight with the

Quantification of relative binding in ChIP assays was
performed using NIH ImageJ software (http://stanxterm.
aecom.yu.edu/wiki/index.php?page=Using_ImageJ), and
each gene promoter was analyzed in 3 independent
immunoprecipitations. Arbitrary optical density values
obtained through ImageJ were scaled for each ChIP by
setting the pan-Histone H3 band to 1.

ABCG2− cancer cells are similarly tumorigenic. Cancer
Res. 2005; 65:6207–6219.

In general, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was
used to compare differences in cell numbers, cell-cycle
transit time, cloning and sphere-forming efficiency, tumor
weights, and many other parameters. Fisher’s Exact Test
and χ2 test were used to compare incidence and latency.
Log-Rank test was employed to analyze the survival
curves and ANOVA (F-test) was used to compare multiple
groups. In all these analyses, a P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
