primary mode of action as being through its metabolite, FdUMP,
which covalently binds to thymidylate synthase (TS or TYMS;
ref. 2). Because cancer cells are highly replicating cells compared
with normal cells, inhibition of TS is believed to cause thymidylate
depletion and eventual ‘‘thymidineless death’’ of tumor cells (2).
Even though 5-FU has multiple metabolites that have been
previously shown to induce cell death by the incorporation of
fluorinated nucleotides into DNA and RNA, investigators have
focused primarily on TS as the major target (3). Santi and others
first showed that TS forms a stable complex (termed the ternary
complex or classic complex) from the 5-FU metabolite, FdUMP, and
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (4–6). Since these early biochemical experiments exploring the FdUMP relationship with TS, a
number of investigations focused on 5-FU’s relationship with TS
expression levels in clinical settings (7). Johnston and colleagues
pioneered this field, describing a direct relationship between
increased TS expression levels (mRNA and protein) and decreased
5-FU response (8, 9). Recently, Johnston and colleagues have
modified their initial thesis (10). These investigators now propose
TS expression in the metastatic lesions to be more predictive of
5-FU response than TS levels in the primary tumor (7).
Others tried to use the classic complex formation to obtain
informative clinical information. Peters and colleagues showed an
inhibition of thymidylate synthase enzymatic activity upon the
formation of classic complexes in cancer cells and proposed this to
be more predictive of response compared with TS expression levels
(11). Brody and colleagues advanced a technique put forth by
Drake and colleagues (12) in detecting classic complexes in vivo,
thus promoting the idea that the tissue detection of classic
complexes may be predictive, potentially allowing more appropriate dosing for 5-FU cancer cell targeting and monitoring of cellular
effects of 5-FU in patients (6).
Other molecular determinants evolved from the TS/5-FU
connection. TS tandem repeat (TS-TR) genotyping was proposed
as a means to predict levels of TS expression in patients. Three
main TS genotypes are prevalent in the population: (a) homozygous for two tandem repeats (2R/2R), (b) homozygous for three
tandem repeats (3R/3R), and (c) heterozygous (2R/3R; refs. 13, 14).
The molecular basis for using the TS repeat sequence as a marker
for protein expression, however, is ambiguous. These investigations
presumably concern the efficiency of ribosome translation, which
relies on initiation at the Kozak consensus sequence. The studies
performed by Yawata and Kawakami used the Kozak sequence of
the firefly luciferase gene, and not the exact Kozak sequence of the
human TS gene (13, 15). Thus, the laboratory experiments did not
completely establish that the tandem repeat sequence is a clinically
relevant marker for TS protein expression and the related 5-FU

Abstract
The major determinants of 5-flurouracil (5-FU) response
would seem, based on accumulated literature, to be thymidylate synthase (TYMS, TS) expression levels, TS gene modifications, and TP53 status. We tested 5-FU sensitivity in yeast and
human cancer cell models in which TS or TP53 alleles and
expression were varied. Polymorphic TS tandem repeat status,
TS expression levels reported, TS intragenic mutations, and
TP53 status in outbred and experimental cancer cell lines did
not predict 5-FU sensitivity or resistance. Novel observations
included a dose-resistant persistence of unbound TS protein
in many cancers and, upon 5-FU treatment of the colon cancer
cell line, HCT116, evidence of allelic switching favoring
transcripts of the mutant TS allele. The reported alleles
having an intragenic mutation could not be causally associated with major degrees of 5-FU sensitivity. In yeast, TS
protein was altered upon treatment with FdUMP, but 5-FU
toxicity seemed to be largely RNA-based, being rescued by
uridine rather than by thymidine. Cancer cell lines were also
rescued from 5-FU toxicity with uridine rather than thymidine.
Additionally, a TS (CDC21) knockout yeast strain, obviating
any potential role for TS protein as a target, was hypersensitive to 5-FU. When denatured proteins from cancer cells
treated with radiolabeled 5-FU were labeled, species with
alternative molecular weights other than TS were visualized,
providing further evidence for alternative 5-FU protein
targets. These data emphasize that TS and TP53 status do
not consistently explain the variance in responses of fluoropyrimidine-treated cancer cells, in part due to RNA-based
toxicity. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):984–91]

Introduction
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutics against gastrointestinal malignancies. Heidelberger
and colleagues created 5-FU over 50 years ago by substituting a
fluorine atom for a hydrogen in the pyrimidine ring to create an
antagonist of uracil (1). Administered primarily intravenously
either by bolus or prolonged continuous infusion schedules, 5-FU is
metabolized both in the liver and then intracellularly by a number
of enzymes. The prevalent view in the literature represents 5-FU’s

Limits of TYMS and TP53 in Predicting 5-FU Sensitivity

Bunz and colleagues showed that 400 Amol/L of uridine, but not
400 Amol/L of thymidine, rescued TP53 wild-type cancer cells from
apoptosis otherwise induced by exposure to 5-FU (19).
Non–cancer cell models were also used to study the mechanism
of 5-FU toxicity. Previously, we used yeast to study the TS/5-FU
relationship, finding that yeast TS is covalently modified upon 5-FU
exposure (6). Yeast models can be used to distinguish between
DNA-based and RNA-based mechanisms of toxicity (32). Recently,
Gustavsson and Ronne showed that tRNA-modifying enzymes can
be targeted by 5-FU in yeast cells (33). In the current study, we
evaluated a number of cancer cell lines and yeast experimental
models to explore 5-FU sensitivity and resistance.

response. Furthermore, Brody and colleagues recently reported the
difficulty of using this prediction because gastrointestinal tumors
are typically unstable at chromosome 18, in which the TS gene
resides (14). Hence, even if it were a marker for response, it would
be difficult to unambiguously determine the TS-TR status in tumor
cells (14).
We recently reported a trend to exist between TS expression
levels and 5-FU clinical response in the literature (7). This trend
was modest, being for practical purposes insignificant, even when
stratifying the data using a number of relevant variables (7).
Besides TS expression and TS-TR status, endogenous TS mutations
have been identified and described previously as conferring
resistance to 5-FU. In 1993, Hughey and colleagues reported that
the HCT116 cell line harbored a heterozygous TS mutation (16).
A PubMed search combining the terms of ‘‘HCT116’’ and
‘‘5-fluorouracil’’ retrieved over 80 articles, underscoring the
utilization of this cell line by investigators studying 5-FU, yet most
of the studies did not cite nor take into account this prior work. In
laboratory investigations exploring the functional significance of
this mutation, the mutation affected the binding capacity of
FdUMP to the TS protein, which harbored the mutated amino acid
change (tyrosine to histidine at residue 33; refs. 16, 17). In another
study, the colorectal cancer cell line HCT C was mutagenized by
EMS and a subclone, C18, was identified by selecting for cells
having reduced TS enzymatic activity. The C18 subline had
artificially acquired a homozygous mutation of TS; a new point
mutation (C ! T) at nucleotide 647 converted Ser216 to leucine,
yielding a nonfunctional allele as tested in autotrophic TS-null
Escherichia coli (18). This type of intragenic null TS mutation is
not reported to exist naturally in human cancers. The authors
determined the effect of these mutations when TS protein
was expressed in hamster cells or prokaryotes, yet did not directly
determine whether they altered sensitivity towards 5-FU in cancer
cells.
Besides TS, other variables have been proposed to affect 5-FU
response. Bunz and colleagues showed that TP53 disruption in a
clone of cancer cells was associated with resistance to high
concentrations of 5-FU (19). A number of studies followed this
report (more than 450 citations to date). Other predictors have also
been proposed for 5-FU response and sensitivity. These are either
integral parts of the 5-FU metabolic pathway that produce FdUMP
or are thought to regulate TS expression, including the YES gene,
thymidine kinase, thymidine phosphorylase, dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase, orotate phosphoribosyl-transferase, or 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (20–26). Ribic and colleagues
found that patients with colorectal cancer whose tumors had the
classic form of microsatellite instability (MSI) did not benefit from
5-FU therapy, whereas other patients did (27). This finding was
significant because roughly 15% of colorectal tumors have the MSI
form of genetic instability. MSI cancers harbor a greater number of
subtle nucleotide sequence changes than the majority of colorectal
cancers; usually, these cancer types have gross chromosomal
changes (known as chromosomal instability) without high levels of
sequence instability (28).
In addition to DNA-based toxicity, 5-FU–induced RNA-based
toxicity has been described. For example, Cory and colleagues
reversed the toxicity of 5-FU in Novikoff hepatoma cells by adding
uridine to the medium (29). Pritchard and colleagues showed that
in TP53-deficient mice, 5-FU–induced apoptosis was due to a
disruption in RNA rather than in DNA metabolism (30), and Klubes
and colleagues found uridine to rescue 5-FU toxicity in vivo (31).

Materials and Methods
Cancer cell lines and yeast strains obtained or generated. Colorectal
cancer cell lines RKO, HCT116 cells, the TP53 knockout cell line (derived
from HCT116), and DLD-1 were either collected from the American Type
Culture Collection or donated by Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD). We generated a heterozygous TS knockout
clone in RKO cells and a derivative of the cell line (‘‘add-back’’) in which
exogenous TS expression was introduced, as previously described (Table 1;
ref. 14). Here, we further generated stable cell lines of the RKO parental,
TS+/, and HCT116 cell lines that included overexpression of wild-type TS
and of a reported HCT116-derived mutant allele changing tyrosine at amino
acid 33 to a histidine (ref. 16; see description and names of cell lines in
Table 1). The HCT C parental line and a subclone (HCT C18) containing the
TS homozygous mutation was donated by Dr. S. Berger (18). The parental
and genetically engineered yeast TS knockout strains were provided to us by
Dr. J.F. Diffley and maintained as previously described (34) except as
indicated otherwise. We generated drug-resistant HCT116 cell lines by
continuously passaging parental clones in increasing amounts of 5-FU (i.e.,
1 Amol/L for 1 month, followed by 1.5, up to 3 or 10 Amol/L). Cells were
maintained in culture with z3 Amol/L of 5-FU for >1 year, with fresh
medium and 5-FU provided twice weekly.
Cell culture assays and survival curves. We plated roughly 1  103
cells per well in a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were treated with 5-FU
without a change in the medium (Sigma). Five to 7 days after a single
treatment, cells were washed, lysed in water, and the DNA labeled with
0.5% Picogreen (Molecular Probes), whereby fluorescence was subsequently
measured to assess changes in the surviving cell population.
DNA sequencing. PCR-amplified products from genomic DNA templates
were produced from the indicated cell lines and samples. The primers used
for the amplification of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and TS are
available upon request. PCR products were purified and analyzed by
automated capillary sequencing. The mutations in cell lines HCT C18,
HCT116, and TS+/.RKO were confirmed by sequencing.
Detection and TA cloning of the HCT116 mutant allele. HCT116 has a
heterozygous mutation of TS, Y33H (16). We treated HCT116 cells at various
concentrations overnight. RNA of individual cultures were converted to bulk
cDNA for sequencing. Additionally, we inserted PCR products into a TA
vector (pCR 2.1) to examine the sequences of a consecutive series of
plasmid clones to enumerate the relative expression of the two alleles. A
mutated clone was subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 Zeo vector (Invitrogen)
for follow-up functional studies (14).
Radiolabeling cell culture experiments. We treated two cancer cell
lines with C14-labeled 5-FU for >48 h and then made protein lysates, which
were electrophoretically separated on a 10% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The
gel was fixed and dried. Autoradiography exposure was performed after
more than 2 months at 80jC.
Immunoblotting. For each cell line, roughly equal cell numbers were
plated and then lysed. Protein lysates were separated by electrophoresis on
10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and TS immunoblotting performed as
previously published (6).
TS-TR detection PCR-based assay. We performed PCR with previously
published primer sets (35) using genomic DNA of cell lines and tumor

samples. PCR-amplified products were separated using 3% LB agarose gels
(Faster Better Media, LLC; ref. 36).
Real-time PCR assay for the analysis of TS mRNA levels. RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 Ag) was converted to
cDNA using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time
PCR was performed on the iCycler (Bio-Rad) with TS- and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)–specific primer sets (available upon
request). The relative fold change was normalized using GAPDH as a
control, and fold change was calculated by comparing TS expression of
treated and untreated cultures. For each primer set, a standard curve,
melting curve, and measures of PCR efficiency were obtained (14).

protein expression was similar among these cell lines, even though
they had differing TS-TR status (Table 1; Fig. 1B and C). We
extended and verified previous work identifying the TS-TR status in
these cancer cell lines (Table 1; Fig. 1C; ref. 14).
TS and TP53 status do not associate robustly with 5-FU
sensitivity. Examining expression levels, TS protein modification,
TS-TR status, or mutational status of TS or TP53 genes, we did not
find a notable association with 5-FU sensitivity (Table 1; Fig. 2A).
Figure 2A shows the 5-FU dose-response of the majority of publicly
available pancreatic cancer cell lines. As indicated from Table 1 and
Fig. 1C, these cell lines have different TS-TR status and TP53 status,
yet all have broadly similar sensitivity to 5-FU.
DLD-1 cells are more resistant to 5-FU than to other lines.
The survival data of three MSI cancer cell lines (RKO, HCT116, and
DLD-1 cells) were determined (Fig. 2A; Table 1). RKO and HCT116
have similar sensitivity, whereas DLD-1 cells are resistant to 5-FU.
We further sequenced the coding sequence of the TS gene in a
number of colon MSI cell lines (RKO, DLD-1, HT 29, and SW48).
Functionally, SHMT catalyzes the reversible interconversion of
serine and THF to methyleneTHF. Because the MSI line, DLD-1, was
an outlier, resistant cell line in our experiments, we thus sequenced
the repetitive nucleotide tracts in the coding sequence of SHMT
in DLD-1 and the other lines. No mutations were found in SHMT or
TS in the above listed cell lines (other than the reported mutations
of the TS gene in HCT116 and HCT C18; data not shown).

(a ternary complex of drug, thymidylate synthase, and a methylene
group), and the lower band is unmodified TS protein (6, 12). TS

Limits of TYMS and TP53 in Predicting 5-FU Sensitivity

Disruption of TP53 did not affect 5-FU sensitivity at
standard 5-FU concentrations. Figure 2C shows the consequences
of disrupting p53 in a previously developed model (116./p53;
ref. 19). Although reported to have relative resistance at
400 Amol/L 5-FU (ref. 19; confirmed in Fig. 2C) in the cell survival
assay, we did not find differences in sensitivity between the
isogenic p53 wild-type and the 116./p53 cells when testing
lower, clinically relevant 5-FU concentrations (19). In another
experiment, HCT116 derivative clones showed no resistance irrespective of whether p53 was disrupted or the HCT116 mutant allele
was stably overexpressed (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we did not find
any systematic differences in 5-FU sensitivity in unrelated cell lines
known to be TP53 wild-type or TP53-mutated (Fig. 1A; Table 1).
Clone C18, having a homozygous mutation in TS, resembles
its parental cell line HCT C in 5-FU sensitivity. We confirmed
the homozygous nature of the HCT C mutation by sequencing
(data not shown). The TS-mutated protein was not readily detected
by the TS-106 antibody, perhaps due to mutational disruption of
the epitope or by protein instability (Fig. 1D; ref. 18). Figure 2C
shows that the HCT C isogenic paired cell lines, differing in TS
status, did not differ in 5-FU sensitivity.
The HCT116 cell line has differential expression of the wildtype and mutant TS alleles upon exposure to 5-fluoropyrimidines. We confirmed the heterozygous mutation in HCT116
cells (T>C mutation in the coding region of genomic DNA and
cDNA; data not shown; Fig. 3A; ref. 16). We extracted RNA at
different time points from HCT116 cell cultures exposed to various
5-FU concentrations, predominantly detecting the mutated TS
allele in 25 of 26 separate cultures by sequencing of cDNA (Fig. 3A;
Table 2). As a control, 4 out of 5 untreated cultures predominantly
expressed wild-type TS cDNA (P V 0.001; Table 2). cDNA cloning
confirmed a similar pattern of TS allele-specific expression. All 12
cloned PCR products from an untreated culture were wild-type in
sequence, whereas four of five clones from a 5-FU–treated culture
expressed the mutant allele (P V 0.002; Fig. 3A; Table 2).
Real-time PCR analysis of TS mRNA expression in HCT116 cells
revealed an up-regulation of TS expression in 5-FU–treated cells
versus untreated cells (Fig. 3B). This induction in HCT116
cells occurred at 5 to 20 Amol/L of 5-FU, whereas RKO cells did
not induce TS expression as strongly (Fig. 3B).
Drug-resistant HCT116 lines (116.R1 and 116.R2) were evolved
through constant drug exposure. They had a predominant
expression of the mutated TS allele upon the sequencing of bulk
cDNA (Table 2), yet the termination of 5-FU exposure reduced the
TS expression (indicated as 116.R2, comparing 10 Amol/L of 5-FU
and no 5-FU; Fig. 3B). HCT116 is homozygous for the TS tandemrepeat polymorphism (2R/2R; Table 1; Fig. 1C), thus an allelic
difference at the polymorphic site could not explain our findings.
Also, in vitro studies showed that the mutated TS allele in this cell
line was not directly responsible for 5-FU resistance (Fig. 2D), and
thus, a different survival of cells selectively overexpressing the
mutant allele seems implausible. Thus, the observed induction of
TS mRNA expression, which seems to be allele-specific in HCT116,
indicates autoregulation through a transcriptional activation of the
TS gene most likely exerted at the level of genomic DNA. This is
distinct from reports supporting or detracting from a proposed
autoregulation system in which TS protein binds the TS mRNA to
control mRNA translation (37). Such mechanisms of negative
feedback autoregulation would tend to mitigate the role of TS as
a major determinant of 5-FU toxicity, enhancing interest in
alternative targets of the drug.

we determined the TS protein levels of the cell lines generated for survival
assays. Nonspecific bands (NS ) reflect equal loading of protein per lane. Cell
lines were treated as indicated with 5-FU (+) or untreated () before cell lysates

over a year for the R1 line and 2 years for the R2 line (Fig. 2A
and B), with an average of two passages per week in 5-FU
supplemented medium. Figure 2A confirms the resistant status of
these evolved HCT116 cell lines as compared with the parental line
and to the resistant DLD-1 line. The RKO.HCTmut line (the RKO
cell line engineered to stably overexpress the HCT116-derived
mutation of TS; Fig. 1A; Table 1) was slightly resistant as compared
with the RKO.TS cells (overexpressing wild-type TS) and the
parental line (Fig. 2B; Table 1), although perhaps within the range
of variation one expects from testing solitary clones. In contrast,
the TS+/ knockout cells had striking differences in 5-FU
sensitivity (Fig. 2B; Table 1; ref. 14). The engineered 116.HCTmut
cells were not more resistant than the adaptively created resistant
lines (116.R1 and 116.R2; Fig. 2B; Table 1). These data suggest that
the HCT116-derived mutant form of the TS gene is somewhat
similar to wild-type TS in governing the degree of 5-FU sensitivity
when exogenously overexpressed, but that other rather familiar
forms of variation (such as engineered decreases or increases in TS
gene expression, adaptive changes after drug exposure, and choice
of a particular cell line) could considerably affect the level of 5-FU
sensitivity of a given cell population. The magnitude of these
changes in sensitivity provides a useful perspective against which
to compare other potential influences upon the 5-FU sensitivity of
cells, examined below.

reports in which mammalian and human cancer cells were rescued

Limits of TYMS and TP53 in Predicting 5-FU Sensitivity

supports the importance of RNA-related 5-FU toxicity, and use of
a TS-null strain removes the possibility of an effect from having
targeted the TS protein.
Potential for other proteins to be covalently modified upon
treatment with 5-FU. C14-labeled 5-FU (10 Amol/L) was added to
overnight cultures. Proteins were then electrophoretically separated. Three sizes of proteins were detected (50, 36, and 20 kDa) by
autoradiography. One protein was presumably TS (at 36 kDa),
whereas the others were unknown (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
TS is known to be targeted by FdUMP, and hence, the field has
been largely focused on the TS/5-FU relationship (7). However,
when analyzing both experimental models and the literature, the
time-honored connection between TS and 5-FU is ambiguous (7).
Logically, TS, an essential enzyme for replicating cells, could serve
as a good therapeutic target in cancer cells. Perhaps in the future,
more specific, novel or yet-to-be developed TS inhibitors (42) could
use TS expression levels as a predictive marker for drug response.
We conclude that at clinically relevant concentrations of 5-FU,
we observed no relation between TP53 status and 5-FU sensitivity
among either outbred cell lines or the paired parental and TP53
knockout cell line (19). From the time of the TP53 knockout
publication, more than 400 reports have investigated a link
between TP53 and 5-FU (19). Before this seminal publication,
fewer than 80 publications studied this connection.
Although TP53 and TS status have enjoyed a dominant literature
position in relation to 5-FU sensitivity and resistance, other
investigators have explored alternative molecular determinants of
5-FU sensitivity (43–45). These studies, including the results of gene
expression profiling (46), further warn of the complexity that is
obscured when attempting to correlate a single molecular variable
to 5-FU response. Optimistically, however, the search for alternative
5-FU targets could help better define practical clinical predictors
for fluoropyrimidine-based therapy (Fig. 4D). RNA-based toxicity
has been described recently, and in the past, as a plausible target,
but many investigators chose to ignore it (19, 29–32). Plausible
candidate 5-FU targets related to RNA-mediated toxicity would
include tRNA (33) and DNA primase (Fig. 4D; ref. 47).
An unsuspected finding was that the variant and wild-type TS
alleles had differential induction of transcripts upon 5-FU
treatment in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4; Table 2). The variant allele
served as a ‘‘tag’’, permitting the observation, but need not be
causally related. Renewed attention to feedback control of TS gene
transcription at the genomic level seems warranted. Perhaps such
studies would be especially attractive for certain cell types in which
rescue by thymidine rather than uridine can place a dominant role

treatment of yeast cells (6). TS-null yeast were more sensitive to
5-FU (Fig. 4A; ref. 34). TS-null yeast grown in the presence of
uridine, but not those in thymidine, avoided toxicity (Fig. 4B).
Figure 4C confirms the absence of TS protein in lysates of the TS
knockout strain. Uridine rescue of yeast treated with 5-FU further

clinicians to stratify patients based on a limited number of
variables. An improved understanding of the targets of 5-FU may
permit the further development of derivative drugs that inactivate
only a select subset of the 5-FU ‘‘target universe.’’ Folate
antagonists are but one example of this line of reasoning.

on TS protein as the major determinant of toxicity, or in which the
use of antifolates largely removes the possibility of a competing
RNA-based mechanism of toxicity.
In summary, our work shows that variables other than TS or
TP53, some being novel and others being known but often
overlooked, serve as major factors altering the experimental and
clinical sensitivity of cancer cells to 5-FU exposure. Therefore,
many proposed biomarkers cannot be expected to readily serve as
predictors of treatment response in real-life clinical settings in
which many salient variables, including those that have not yet
been discovered, operate simultaneously. The effectiveness of 5-FU
may lie in the fact that multiple metabolites and targets exist (2),
which also makes predicting a patient’s response to this drug
potentially impossible. Nevertheless, a genetic understanding of
cancer and the molecular aspects that drive tumorigenesis
prepares us for a new era of modern drug design that can produce
agents that target limited numbers of target molecules (including
TS) in cancer cells without off-target effects (48, 49), allowing
