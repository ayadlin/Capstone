ABSTRACT
MiR-106b is overexpressed in various types of cancers and is associated with
the regulation of the carcinogenic processes. Using RT-PCR, we have identified
overexpression of miRNA-106b in various melanoma cell lines (A375, Hs294t, SKMel28, SK-Mel 119, Mel 1241, Mel 1011 and Mel 928) as compared to its expression
in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM). The overexpression of miR-106b
in melanoma cells (A375, Hs294t) was associated with greater cell proliferation
capacity than NHEM. Treatment of A375 and Hs294t cells with anti-miR-106b resulted
in inhibition of cell proliferation as well as G1-phase arrest. We determined the
effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) on the expression of miRNA-106b
and its underlying molecular targets. Treatment of A375 and Hs294t cells with GSPs
resulted in suppression of the levels of miRNA-106b, cytotoxicity, G1-phase arrest and
reactivation of p21/WAF1/Cip1. Dietary GSPs significantly inhibited growth of A375
melanoma cell tumor xenografts in nude mice, which was associated with reduction
in the levels of miRNA-106b, tumor cell proliferation and increases in the levels of
p21/WAF1/Cip1 protein. These studies suggest that miRNA-106b plays a crucial role
in melanoma growth and that GSPs act as an inhibitor of miR-106b thereby blocking
melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo models.

INTRODUCTION

treatment.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA
molecules that regulate gene expression by binding
to the 3’-untranslated regions (3’UTRs) of specific
mRNAs. Alterations in the expression level of miRNA
are correlated with cancer development [5], and play an
important role in cell proliferation, cell differentiation,
and cell death. Many of these miRNAs possess oncogenic
or tumor suppressor activity in various tumors [5, 6], but
little is known about their potential role in melanoma
progression. miR-106b is involved in multiple cancer/
tumor types, such as gastric, hepatocellular, laryngeal,
prostate, breast, endometrial, pancreas and gastric,
and thyroid cancers, non-melanoma skin cancer and
melanoma [7-15]. Recently, it has been reported that

Malignant melanoma is an aggressive and deadly
skin cancer that causes the majority of skin cancer-related
deaths [1, 2]. Importantly, the incidence of melanoma is
increasing rapidly in children [3]. According to a National
Cancer Institute report, there were an estimated 76,700
new cases of melanoma and 9,710 melanoma-related
deaths in the United States in 2013 [4]. Although efforts
have been made to develop an understanding of the causes
of melanoma progression and more effective therapies,
they have met with limited success. As melanoma is
a highly malignant cancer, an approach that reduces
its growth and progression potential may facilitate the
development of an effective strategy for its prevention or

pRB/E2F and p21/WAF1/Cip1, which promote cell cycle
progression, are direct targets of miR-106b [7, 16]. Cellcycle progression relies on the activation of cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which act together in
G1 phase to initiate S phase and in G2 phase to initiate
mitosis. These kinases promote expression of cell cycle
genes controlled by E2F transcription factors [17]. In
addition, members of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb)
family inhibit cell cycle entry through repression of E2Fregulated cell cycle genes [18]. When activated in the G1
phase, cyclin D/CDK4, 6 and cyclin E/CDK2 kinases
phosphorylate pRb, thereby preventing its association
with E2F and allowing E2F transcription factors to induce
S-phase gene expression [18].
As phytochemicals are emerging new options
for the prevention and treatment of melanoma [19], the
proanthocyanidins from grape seeds (GSPs) were tested
for their efficacy against melanoma and in particularly
as an inhibitor of miR-106b. Grape seeds are rich in
proanthocyanidins (60–70%), which are mainly composed
of dimers, trimers, tetramers and oligomers of monomeric
catechins or epicatechins [20, 21]. GSPs have been shown
to have cytotoxic effects on tumor cells without having
adverse effects on normal cells [22]. As is the case for
other bioactive phytochemicals, GSPs have been shown
to have anti-carcinogenic effects in some animal tumor
models with no apparent signs of toxicity in animals [2325]. In this study, we first examined the role of miRNA106b on the progression of melanoma cells. We then
evaluated the chemotherapeutic effect of GSPs in terms of
the proliferative potential of melanoma cancer cells and
whether it is mediated through their effects on miRNA106b. For this purpose, we used various human melanoma
cancer cell lines as an in vitro model, and ascertained
whether GSPs inhibit the growth of melanoma cancer cells
through its inhibitory effect on miRNA-106b expression.
We present evidence that GSPs inhibit melanoma cancer
cell proliferation and in vivo tumor xenograft growth
and that they do so through: (i) down-regulation of
miRNA-106b expression, and (ii) blocking of melanoma
cell division in the G1 phase of the cell cycle through
reactivation of tumor suppressor protein p21/WAF1/Cip1.

lines express higher levels of miR-106b than NHEMs
(amplicon size 58bp). The levels of miRNA-106b varied
among the cell lines, with the highest amounts being found
in the Mel 1241, SK Mel 119, SK Mel 28, Hs294t and Mel
1011 lines. In general, the expression levels of miRNA106b in these cells lines is approximately 3- to 6-fold
higher than in NHEMs, as estimated by densitometry
quantification of the band intensity using imageJ software
and calculation of the relative band intensity ratio of miR106b vs. U6 (Fig. 1B). To assess the role of miR-106b
on the progression of melanoma cells, we examined and
compared the proliferating potential of various melanoma
cell lines using an MTT assay. As shown in Figure 1C,
overexpression of miR-106b in melanoma cell lines was
associated with greater cell viability or proliferation
potential, as is evident from the results shown in Figure
1B and Figure 1C.

effects on cell cycle regulation. For this purpose, A375
and Hs294t cells were treated with anti-miR-106b for
48 h. The cells were then harvested and subjected to cell
cycle analysis. We found that the A375 cells were arrested

group (79.4%, P<0.01) as compared to the cells of the
control group (40.2%), as shown in Figure 2C. Similar
results were obtained on analysis of cell cycle progression
in Hs294t cells. Cell division relies on the activation
of cyclins, which bind to CDKs to induce cell-cycle
progression towards S phase and, later, to initiate mitosis.
Therefore, we checked the effect of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest
on the regulatory proteins of this phase using western blot

analysis. As shown in Figure 2D, suppression of miR106b in A375 and Hs294t human melanoma cells caused
inhibition of cyclin D1, D2 and E, and reduction in the
expression levels of CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 proteins in
both cell lines. Thus, it can be concluded that in melanoma
cells overexpression of miR-106b may have a role in
enhanced cell cycle progression while downregulation of
miRNA-106b is associated with arrest of the G0/G1 phase
and suppression of the levels of cyclins and CDKs proteins

doses of 40 and 60 µg/ml respectively (Fig. 3D, right
panel). In these experiments, colony formation data were
analyzed in terms of percent of control (non-GSPs-treated
group).

GSPs induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest in
melanoma cells
Based on the effects of GSPs on cell viability,
we selected doses of 20, 40 and 60 μg/ml of GSPs for
further studies of cell cycle regulation in melanoma cells.
As we have found that inhibition of miRNA-106b in
melanoma cells resulted in G1-phase arrest (Fig. 2C), we
determined whether inhibition of melanoma cell viability
by GSPs also results in G1-phase cell cycle arrest. A375
and Hs294t cells were treated with GSPs for 48 h and
cell cycle analysis was performed using FACS analysis,
as described previously [23, 25]. As shown in Figure 4A,
treatment of Hs294t cells with GSPs for 48 h resulted in
an accumulation of a higher percentage of cells in the G1phase of cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner: 20 µg/ml
(42.0%), 40 µg/ml (50.5%, P<0.01) and 60 µg/ml (83.4%,
P<0.001) as compared to the non-GSPs-treated controls
(28.0%). It is important to note that the population in G1
phase of control cells (non-GSPs-treated) in Hs294t cells
is less (28.0%, Fig. 4A) than the G1 phase cell population
in control Hs294t cells of Fig. 2 (48%). This difference in
G1 arrest population might be due to the difference in the
number of passages of Hs294t cells and other experimental
conditions. More or less similar patterns were found on
analysis of the effects of GSPs treatment on cell cycle
progression of A375 cells. These cell cycle data suggest
that the GSPs-induced reduction in cell proliferation and
cell viability in melanoma cells may be associated with the
induction of G1 arrest by the GSPs, and that these changes
may also be associated with the downregulation of miR106b levels in melanoma cells on GSPs treatment.

Downregulation of miR-106b in melanoma cells
after treatment with GSPs leads to reduction in
the viability of melanoma cells
We next tested whether GSPs have the ability to
inhibit the over-expression of miRNA-106b in melanoma
cells. The A375 and Hs294t cells were treated with
various concentrations of GSPs (0, 20, 40 and 60 μg/ml)
for 48 h. The cells were then harvested and the levels of
miRNA-106b were analyzed using RT-PCR. The RTPCR analysis revealed that treatment of melanoma cells
with GSPs decreased the levels of miR-106b in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A). The data for the two cell
lines are summarized and presented in terms of the relative
band intensity ratio of miRNA-106b vs. U6 in Figure 3B.
The expression level of miRNA-106b was significantly
reduced (P<0.01) after the treatment of these melanoma
cell lines with GSPs.
As treatment with GSPs downregulated miR106b expression in melanoma cells and suppression of
miRNA-106b reduced the viability of melanoma cells,
we further determined the effect of GSPs on the viability
of melanoma cells. For this purpose, A375 and Hs294t
melanoma cells were treated with different concentrations
of GSPs for 24 and 48 h and cell viability was determined
using an MTT assay. As shown in Figure 3C (left
panel), treatment of A375 cells with GSPs reduced cell
viability of cells in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01)
with the reduction in viability ranging from 13% to 37%
(P<0.05) after 24 h, and 22% to 53% (P<0.01) after 48
h of treatment. Under identical conditions, a more or
less similar pattern of GSPs-induced inhibitory effects
were observed on Hs294t cells (Fig. 3C, right panel). We
also verified the cytotoxic or anti-carcinogenic effects of
GSPs on melanoma cells using colony formation assays,
as detailed under Materials and Methods. We found that
treatment of A375 and Hs294t cells with GSPs resulted
in a reduction in the colony formation potential of the
melanoma cells in terms of both the numbers of colonies
and the size of the colonies, as shown in Figure 3D (left
panel). GSPs treatment suppressed the colony formation
ability of A375 cells by 45% and 69% at the doses of 40
and 60 μg/ml respectively, and suppressed the colony
formation ability of Hs294t cells by 40% and 65% at the

GSPs downregulate the levels of G1-phase linked

Based on the above data, we determined the effects
of GSPs on cell cycle regulatory proteins in melanoma
cells. The melanoma cells were treated with GSPs for
48 h and cell lysates were subjected to analysis of cell
cycle regulatory proteins using western blot analysis. This
revealed that treatment of A375 and Hs294t cells with
GSPs for 48 h resulted in a reduction in the expression of
cyclins D1, D2 and E in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
4B). Similarly, a pronounced reduction in the expression
levels of CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 was observed in both
A375 and Hs294t cell lines (Fig. 4B).

As we had found that treatment of melanoma cells
with GSPs resulted in suppression of miR-106b (Fig. 3A
& 3B), we further determined whether treatment of GSPs
upregulate or reactivate the expression of p21/WAF1/

that GSPs treatment reactivated or restored the levels of
p21/WAF1/Cip1 in both A375 and Hs294t cell lines as
compared to the cells which were not treated with GSPs
(Fig. 5B). Further, treatment of GSPs also reduced the

performed only with A375 melanoma cells. Based on our
prior in vivo studies [23, 24], GSPs at a concentration
of 0.5% were used to supplement the AIN76A control
diet. To address the potential effect of GSPs on tumor
xenograft growth of A375 cells, an equal number
(4x106) of A375 cells were injected subcutaneously into
athymic nude mice and the growth of the tumor was
recorded regularly as indicated in Figure 6A. Intake of
dietary GSPs inhibited the growth of the A375 tumor
xenografts throughout the experimental protocol, and at
the termination of the experiment the inhibitory effect
was 61% compared to the growth of tumor xenografts
in mice fed the unsupplemented AIN76A diet (Fig.
6A). The inhibitory effect of GSPs on the growth of the

tumor also was apparent in the visual appearance of the
tumors harvested at the termination of the experiment
as illustrated in Figure 6B. Further, at the termination
of the experiment, the wet tumor weight (g)/mouse was
determined for each mouse. As shown in Figure 6C, at the
termination of the experiment, it was found that dietary
GSPs significantly inhibited (66%, P<0.01) the growth of
A375 tumor xenografts as compared to the growth of the
xenograft tumors in non-GSPs-treated control mice.

Dietary GSPs down regulates miR-106b
expression in tumor xenograft tissues
On RT-PCR analysis of miR-106b expression in
the xenograft tumor tissues, we found that the expression
level of miR-106b was markedly lower in the mice fed
the GSPs-supplemented diet as compared with the control
group (Fig. 7A). To further characterize the changes in
miR-106b expression in the tumors, fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) was used to localize the expression
pattern of miR-106b using Locked Nucleic Acid probe
(Figure 7B). In concurrence with our RT-PCR data, in situ
signals for miR-106b expression (shown in green) were
very low in tumor sections obtained from mice fed GSPs
as compared to the mice fed the control diet.

GSPs reactivate p21/WAF1/Cip1 expression and
inhibit proliferation potential of tumor cells in
tumor xenografts
Our finding that downregulation of miR-106b
restores the levels of p21/WAF1/Cip1 in vitro (Fig. 5B),
suggested that p21/WAF1/Cip1 is a direct target of miR106b. We therefore used western blot analysis to determine
the expression levels of p21/WAF1/Cip1 in xenograft
tumor tissues from GSPs-fed and control mice. As shown
in Figure 7C, the results revealed that the expression level
of p21/WAF1/Cip1 was increased or restored in tumor
xenograft tissues from the mice that were fed GSPs as
compared to the expression levels in tumor tissues from
control group of mice which were not given GSPs in
their diet. As uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation is a
characteristic feature of most cancers, we also analyzed the
A375 tumor xenografts for the potential antiproliferative
effects of GSPs using western blot analysis of PCNA and
immunohistochemical detection of PCNA-positive cells.
The western blot analysis revealed that the expression
level of PCNA was lower in tumor tissues obtained
from GSPs-fed mice than in tumor tissues from control
mice (Fig. 7C). The results of the immunohistochemical
detection of PCNA-positive cells in tumor xenograft
tissues confirmed that the percentage of proliferating cells
was significantly lower (58%, P<0.01) in tumor xenografts
from GSPs-treated mice than in the tumor xenografts from
the control mice, as shown in Figure 7D.

DISCUSSION

roles in various biological processes, such as cellular
proliferation, oncogenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis,
and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors [27]. Our
cell proliferation assay analysis indicates that the cell
proliferation potential of melanoma cell lines (A375,
Hs294t, SK Mel 28, SK Mel 119, Mel 1241, Mel 1011,
and Mel 928) was several fold higher than that of NHEM
and that this proliferation potential of melanoma cells is
associated with the higher expression of miR-106b.
To verify whether overexpression of miR-106b in
melanoma cells is associated with enhanced proliferation
of cells, A375 and Hs294t cells were treated with
an inhibitor of miRNA-106b and cell viability was
determined. Downregulation of miR-106b resulted in
suppression of melanoma cell viability, which suggests
that the overexpression of miR-106b observed in the
melanoma cells plays a key role in regulation of melanoma
cell proliferation. This is consistent with the report that

miRNA are small endogenous non-coding singlestranded RNAs that have the capability to interfere with
the expression profile of several genes and proteins either
by inducing a specific target mRNA or by reducing the
translational capability of target mRNA [26]. miRNAs
are involved in many pathologic and physiologic
processes, including carcinogenesis. The role of miR106b has been recognized in tumors of many organs
[7, 8, 10-14]; however, little is known about its role in
melanoma progression. In the present study, we analyzed
the expression profile of miR-106b in seven different
melanoma cell lines and NHEM using RT-PCR. Our
study indicates that the expression of miR-106b is multifold higher (3-6 fold) in melanoma cells than in NHEM.
miRNAs have been demonstrated to play important

that downregulation of miR-106b suppresses the growth of
human glioma cells(28). Ivanovska et al. have shown that
overexpression of miR-106b in cancer cells promotes cell
cycle progression while downregulation inhibits it [16].
The authors also demonstrated that p21/WAF1/Cip1 is a
direct target of miR-106b and its downregulation plays an
effective role in miR-106b-induced cell cycle progression.
Our cell cycle analysis showed that the treatment of
melanoma cells (A375 and Hs294t) with anti-miR-106b
(an inhibitor of miR-106b) markedly induces G1-phase
arrest of both these cell lines indicating that the mechansim
underlying the miR-106b-mediated upregulation of the
proliferation potential of melanoma cells is associated
with enhancement of cell cycle progression. Uncontrolled
cell division or proliferation is dependent on the activation
of cyclins and CDKs in G1-phase, which then interact
and induce cell cycle progression towards S phase. CDK
activity is one of the major causes of cancer progression.
The functions of the CDKs are regulated by specific
inhibitors, such as p21/WAF1/Cip1 [29]. p21/WAF1/Cip1
is generally overexpressed in response to anti-proliferative
signals [30]. The G1 phase arrest in the melanoma cells
after their treatment with anti-miR-106b was associated
with marked suppression of the expression of both cyclins
and CDKs (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) and concomitant
reactivation of p21/WAF1/Cip1 protein. These results
suggest that the ability of the inhibitor of miR-106b to
block the uncontrolled cell cycle progression typical of
melanoma cells and to induce their G1-phase arrest is
mediated through suppression of the levels of cyclins and
CDKs and reactivation of the tumor suppressor protein,
p21/WAF1/Cip1. The ability of miRNAs to target multiple
genes within a pathway is a well described phenomenon
and suggests that therapeutic inhibition of these molecules
may be extremely effective.
In efforts to develop an effective inhibitor of miR106b for the treatment of melanoma, we tested the effect
of GSPs on the expression level of miR-106b in melanoma
cells. Our results suggested that treatment of melanoma
cells with GSPs markedly lowered the levels of miR-106b
in melanoma cells and that this resulted in a reduction in
the viability and the colony forming ability of the cells.
In similar in vitro experiments, the GSPs were found to
reactivate the expression of p21/WAF1/Cip1, which may
have played a crucial role in diminishing the carcinogenic
potential of melanoma cells. Importantly, the levels of
p21/WAF1/Cip1 also are overexpressed/reactivated in
melanoma cells after treatment with anti-miR-106b. These
data indicate two major observations: (i) GSPs act as an
inhibitor of miR-106b in melanoma cells and (ii) that
GSPs reactivate tumor suppressor protein p21/WAF1/Cip1
as does anti-miR-106b in melanoma cells. In addition to
the effect of GSPs on p21/WAF1/Cip1, GSPs also affected
the downstream signaling cascade of p21/WAF1/Cip1, as
indicated by the inhibitory effects of GSPs on pRb, E2F1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and E2F2.
The in vivo studies conducted using
immunocompromised athymic nude mice demonstrated
that dietary GSPs exert a significant inhibitory effect on
the growth of melanoma cell tumor xenografts and without
apparent sign of toxicities in the mice. This inhibitory
effect of GSPs on tumor xenograft growth was associated
with the downregulation of miR-106b expression as well
as upregulation of p21/WAF1/Cip1 protein, which results
in suppression of tumor cell proliferation in the xenograft
tissues.
In summary, we found that miR-106b is markedly
upregulated in melanoma cells and acts as an oncogene
by regulating the proliferation and cell cycle progression.
In addition, our study reveals for the first time that GSPs
have the ability to inhibit the proliferation of melanoma
cells and block their cell cycle regulation through their
inhibitory effect on miR-106b expression. Thus, our study
suggests that (i) miR-106b might be a useful potential
therapeutic target for melanoma treatment, and (ii) GSPs
should be further investigated as a pharmacological agent
alone or in combination with other therapeutic drugs for
better management of melanoma in humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies, chemicals and reagents
The antibodies specific for cyclins, pRbThr356,
E2F1, E2F2, CDK 2, CDK 4, CDK 6, p21/WAF1/Cip1,
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), β-Actin, and
secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-linked antimouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-miR-106b
inhibitor, lipofectamine, primers specific for miRNA-106b
and U6 were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsband, CA).

Cell lines and cell culture conditions
The human melanoma cells lines A375, Hs294t,
and SK-Mel 28 were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Some other
melanoma cell lines such as Mel 1241, Mel 1011, and
Mel 928 were a kind gift from Dr. Paul Robbins (Center
of Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,
MD). A375, Hs294t, Mel 1241, Mel 1011, and Mel 928
cell lines were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, whereas SK-Mel 119 and
SK-Mel 28 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium.
The culture media were supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT),
100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and
the cultures maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 at
370C. Normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs)

were obtained from the Cell Culture Core Facility of Skin
Diseases Research Center at the University of Alabama
at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, and were cultured in
HMGS supplemented melanocytes growth medium-254
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
For the treatment of cells, GSPs were dissolved in
a small amount of DMSO (100 μl), which was added to
the complete cell culture medium to attain the stipulated
concentration of GSPs. The cells were treated when
subconfluent (60-70%). The maximum concentration of
DMSO in media was 0.1% (v/v).

well plates. After overnight incubation, the cells were
treated with or without GSPs (0, 20, 40 and 60 μg/ml)
for 24 and 48 h. At the end of the stipulated time, cells
were treated with 50 µl of 5 mg/ml MTT and the resulting
formazan crystals were dissolved in 150 µl of DMSO. The
absorbance was recorded at 540 nm using a Bio-Rad 3350
microplate reader. The effect of GSPs on cell viability
was calculated in terms of percent of control, which was
arbitrarily assigned a value of 100% viability. We have
also compared the proliferation capacity of melanoma cell
lines without any treatment using MTT assay.
To assess the effects of GSPs on colony formation,
melanoma cells suspended in complete medium were
seeded in wells (2 x 103 cells per well). After 4 d, the cells
were treated with GSPs (40 and 60 µg/ml) for another 14
d. The cultures were maintained in a CO2 incubator during
this time. The colonies were then stained with crystal
violet and counted using an Olympus BX41 microscope
fitted with the cellSens Software (Center Valley, PA).

miRNA extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNAs, which contains 95% miRNAs, were
isolated from cultured melanoma cell lines and normal
human epidermal melanocytes using the TRIZOLchloroform extraction procedure [31, 32]. Briefly, 70-80%
confluent cultured cells were washed with ice-cold PBS
buffer, the cells were covered with 1 ml Trizol (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) reagent and immediately harvested by
scraping. The lysate was transferred into a 15 ml v-shaped
tube and 0.2ml of chloroform was added for phase
separation. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged
at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the
uppermost colorless layer was separated into another
tube and 5.0 ml of isopropyl alcohol was added for
precipitation of RNAs. The sample was incubated at
room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at
4°C. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed
with 75% ethanol then air dried and resuspended into
nuclease-free water after which the RNA concentration
was quantified by spectrophotometry. The RNA was
used to prepare cDNA by using the iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-RAD) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RT-PCR was performed using Platinum
Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with
human specific primers for miR-106b: Forward primer:
TAAAGTGCTGACAGTGCAGATAGTG, miR-106b
Reverse primer: CAAGTACCCACAGTGCGGT, and U6
forward primer: CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA, U 6 reverse
primer: AACGCTTCACG AATTTGCGT, as reported
previously [33]. The RT-PCR conditions were as follows:
Stage I: 95°C for 3 min, 53°C for 1 min, 72°C for 30 sec
(2 cycles); Stage II: 95°C for 3 min, 53°C for 1 min, 72°C
for 30 sec (55 cycles); Stage III: 72°C for 5 min. The PCR
product was run on a 2.5% agarose gel prepared in 1x
Tris-acetate EDTA buffer containing ethidium bromide
and analyzed using a Gel-Doc apparatus.

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow
cytometry with the use of propidium iodide staining (5
µg/ml), as described previously [24], after 48 h of GSPs
treatment or miRNA transfection. Briefly, 1 X 106 cells
were trypsinized, washed with PBS, resuspended in chilled
methanol, and kept at 4°C for 15 min. Cells were then
centrifuged, washed in PBS, resuspended in 450 µl of PBS
and 50 µl of RNase A (2 mg/ml), and incubated at 37°C for
30 min. Following RNase treatment, 500 µl of propidium
iodide was added, and cells were incubated at room
temperature for 60 min in the dark. Cell cycle analysis
was performed using FACScaliber Flow Cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped with Cell Quest 3.3
software in the Core Facility of the UAB Comprehensive
Cancer Center. Analysis of cell cycle distribution was
carried out using ModFit software (Verity Software House,
Topsham, ME).

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared following the treatment of
melanoma cells for the indicated time periods, as detailed
previously [25]. Tumor lysates were prepared similarly
for the analysis of protein biomarkers. Proteins were
resolved using 10-12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the nonspecific binding sites, the membrane was incubated with
the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The membrane was
then incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody. Specific protein bands were visualized
using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Equal
loading of proteins on the gel was verified by stripping the
membrane and re-probing with an anti-β-actin antibody.

Cell viability and colony formation assays
The viability of melanoma cell lines and NHEMs
was determined using an MTT assay as described
previously [23]. Briefly, 1x104 cells were seeded in 96www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

10646

Transient transfection of miR-106b

the sections were incubated with primary antibody for
PCNA. After washing, the sections were incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibody followed by horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The sections were
further treated with 2,4-diaminobenzidine substrate and
counterstained with hematoxylin. The PCNA-positive
cells were counted in 3-4 different fields and photographed
using an Olympus microscope (Model BX40F4, Tokyo,
Japan) fitted with a Q-color 5 Olympus camera.

For functional analysis, the expression of miR-106b
in melanoma cells was silenced using a pre-designed antimiR-106b inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1x105 cells were
seeded onto 6-well culture plates. A375 and Hs294t cell
lines (60-70% confluent) were transfected in serum-free
medium with the anti-miRNA inhibitor, or scramble
control probe, at a final concentration of 70 nM, using
Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were kept
in a culture medium containing 2% FBS up to 48 h. The
cells were then harvested and used in the functional assay,
cell cycle distribution and western blot analysis. Both
untransfected and scramble probe were used as controls
for the transfected A375 and Hs294t cells.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization detection of
miR-106b in tumor sections
For the detection of expression levels of miR-106b
in tumor sections, a FISH assay was performed using
the following LNA/DNA oligos sequences: LNA-miR106b 5’-ATCTGCACTGTCAGCACTTTA-3’, scramble
5’-GTGTAACACGTCT ATACG CCCA-3’ [34]. Briefly,
the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
deparaffinized in xylene (2x 10 min) and rehydrated in
serial ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, and 75%, v/v). The
slides were then treated with 20 µg/ml proteinase K in TE
buffer (100 mM Tris-Hcl, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 10
min at 37°C, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C.
After blocking the endogenous peroxidases with 1% H2O2
for 30 min, slides were prehybridized in prehybridization
buffer (4 x SSC containing 50% formamide) at the 37°C
for 30 min. After prehybridization, slides were hybridized
in hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 10% Dextran
sulfate, 1 x Denhardt’s solution, 4 x SSC, 10 mM DDT,
1 mg/ml yeast t-RNA, 1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm
DNA) with specific DIG-labeled probes at 50°C for
24 h. The sections were washed with gradient SSC
thoroughly (2x SSC, 0.5X SSC and 0.2X SSC) to remove
the background signals, followed by treatment with antidigoxin FITC-conjugated antibody at 37˚C for 2 h. Nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI, and then sections were
analyzed and imaged using a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Japan) at 40x magnification using cellSens
software.

In vivo tumor xenograft study
Female athymic nude mice of 4- to 5-weeks of
age were purchased from the National Cancer Institute
(Bethesda, MD) and housed in the Animal Resource
Facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in
accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines. The animal protocol used in this
study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham. A375 melanoma cells (4x 106 in 100 µl PBS/
animal) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank
of each mouse. After one day of cell inoculation, animals
were divided randomly into two groups. One group of
mice received the AIN76A control diet, while the second
group of mice received a 0.5% GSPs-supplemented
AIN76A control diet in pellet form throughout the
experimental protocol. Each group has 8 mice. The
experiment was terminated at the 4th week after tumor cell
inoculation. The tumor growth was recorded on a weekly
basis, and tumor size was measured using Vernier calipers.
Volumes were calculated using the hemiellipsoid model
formula: tumor volume = ½ (4π/3) (l/2) (w/2) h, where h
= height, w = width and l = length. At the termination of
the experiment, mice were sacrificed and the tumor from
each mouse excised. A portion of the tumor was used to
isolate miRNAs, immunostaining and another part used to
prepare tumor lysates for western blot analysis.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t -test or one-way ANOVA was used to
analyze cell viability, colony formation and tumor size
using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). In each
case, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
