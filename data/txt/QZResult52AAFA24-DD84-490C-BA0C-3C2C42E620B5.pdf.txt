ABSTRACT
Recent studies have shown synergistic cytotoxic effects of simultaneous Chk1and Wee1-inhibition. However, the mechanisms behind this synergy are not known.
Here, we present a flow cytometry-based screen for compounds that cause increased
DNA damage in S-phase when combined with the Wee1-inhibitor MK1775. Strikingly,
the Chk1-inhibitors AZD7762 and LY2603618 were among the top candidate hits of
1664 tested compounds, suggesting that the synergistic cytotoxic effects are due to
increased S-phase DNA damage. Combined Wee1- and Chk1-inhibition caused a strong
synergy in induction of S-phase DNA damage and reduction of clonogenic survival.
To address the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel assay measuring CDKdependent phosphorylations in single S-phase cells. Surprisingly, while Wee1-inhibition
alone induced less DNA damage compared to Chk1-inhibition, Wee1-inhibition
caused a bigger increase in S-phase CDK-activity. However, the loading of replication
initiation factor CDC45 was more increased after Chk1- than Wee1-inhibition and
further increased by the combined treatment, and thus correlated well with DNA
damage. Therefore, when Wee1 alone is inhibited, Chk1 suppresses CDC45 loading and
thereby limits the extent of unscheduled replication initiation and subsequent S-phase
DNA damage, despite very high CDK-activity. These results can explain why combined
treatment with Wee1- and Chk1-inhibitors gives synergistic anti-cancer effects.

INTRODUCTION

in shortage of replication factors such as nucleotides and
replication factor A (RPA), and subsequent replication
stalling and endonuclease-induced DNA breakage
[7, 9, 10]. Such S-phase damage has been termed
“replication catastrophe” [10] and is most likely the major
cause behind single-agent antitumor activity of Wee1
inhibitors [11].
Similar as for Wee1, inhibition of Checkpoint
kinase 1 (Chk1) causes both G2 checkpoint abrogation
and replication catastrophe [12, 13]. Chk1 is thought to
regulate these processes mainly through phosphorylation
of the Cdc25A phosphatase [7, 13]. Upon Chk1 inhibition
Cdc25A is stabilized, giving increased capacity of
Cdc25A to remove the inhibitory phosphorylation on
CDK1 and CDK2, thereby causing increased CDK
activity [14, 15]. Inhibitors of either Chk1 or Wee1 were
thus considered to induce replication catastrophe through

Inhibitors of Wee1 kinase are currently in clinical
trials for cancer treatment as single agents and in
combination with radiation or chemo-therapy [1]. The
antitumor effects have traditionally been attributed to the
role of Wee1 in preventing G2 checkpoint abrogation [2].
Wee1 is required for the G2 checkpoint through mediating
inhibitory phosphorylation of the Tyr-15 residue on CDK1
[3]. Wee1 inhibition leads to abnormally high CDK1
activity, resulting in G2 checkpoint abrogation followed
by mitotic catastrophe [4, 5].
However, in addition to its role in G2 checkpoint
regulation, Wee1 also plays a major role in suppressing
DNA breakage during S-phase [6–8]. Inhibition of Wee1
leads to high CDK1 and CDK2 activity in S-phase
followed by unscheduled replication initiation. This results

a common multistep pathway involving high CDK
activity, unscheduled replication, replication stalling and
subsequent endonuclease-induced DNA breakage [16].
Interestingly, recent preclinical studies have
demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects by simultaneous
inhibition of Wee1 and Chk1. Cancer cell growth was
synergistically reduced both in vitro and in vivo by
combined Wee1 and Chk1 inhibition, as compared
to inhibition of each of these kinases alone [17, 18].
Similar effects have been reported in various cancer cell
lines of different origin, including ovarian, melanoma,
neuroblastoma, leukemia and lymphoma cells, suggesting
that combined Chk1/Wee1 inhibition may be a promising
approach for cancer treatment [17–22]. However, the
molecular mechanisms behind this synergy are not known.
Unbiased large-scale screening has become a powerful
tool in biomedical research. Libraries of compounds
or siRNAs are widely available and can be applied in
functional screens. Whereas siRNA libraries provide
strong genetic screens, the advantages of compounds are
the possibilities for assays involving rapid kinetics and the
direct clinical relevance of many compounds. A typical
screen readout involves detection of antibody-staining by
automated microscopy [23]. However, recent advances have
made it possible to also use flow cytometry in large-scale
screens. By connecting a plate loader to the flow cytometer,
samples from 384- or 96- well plates can be automatically
analysed, allowing rapid and accurate multiparameter
analysis of many thousands of cells from each sample [24].
Here, we describe a novel flow cytometry-based
screen for compounds that cause increased DNA damage
in S-phase when combined with the Wee1 inhibitor
MK1775. The screen revealed the Chk1 inhibitors
AZD7762 and LY2603618 among the top candidate hits
of 1664 tested compounds. Combined inhibition of Wee1
and Chk1 strongly increased replication catastrophe and
reduced clonogenic survival. Moreover, the increased
DNA damage in S-phase upon Wee1 and Chk1 inhibition
correlated much better with loading of the replication
factor CDC45 than with the CDK activity of S-phase cells.
Our results suggest that Chk1 limits the induction of DNA
damage after Wee1 inhibition by suppressing CDC45
loading. These results provide new knowledge about Chk1
function and can explain why simultaneous inhibition of
Wee1 and Chk1 kinases give synergistic antitumor effects.

with the Wee1 inhibitor MK1775 (Figure 1A). Reh
leukemia cells were incubated with the Lopac 1280 or
Selleck Cambridge Cancer 384 compound libraries for
4 hours with or without MK1775. DNA damage and cellcycle profiles were assessed by flow cytometry using an
antibody to the DNA damage marker γH2AX and the
DNA-stain Hoechst, respectively. Reh cells were used
because they grow in suspension at high density, enabling
flow cytometry analysis of samples from single wells of
384-well plates without trypsinization. Furthermore, these
cells show relatively normal DNA-damage checkpoint
responses [25]. To achieve a wide window for detection
of compounds that enhance MK1775-induced S-phase
DNA damage, a concentration of MK1775 (400 nM) that
gave only a small increase in γH2AX staining by itself
was chosen (Figure 1B, top panel).
For quantitative analysis of the screen results, a
region containing S-phase cells was defined based on the
DNA content (Figure 1B), and the median γH2AX level in
this region was obtained. As expected, the CDK inhibitor
Roscovitine prevented γH2AX induction (Figure 1B,
middle panel). In contrast, for example the dihydrofolate
reductase inhibitor Aminopterin caused increased γH2AX
particularly when combined with MK1775 (Figure 1B,
bottom panel). Histograms of the distribution of γH2AX
levels from the samples of individual plates showed a clear
overall increase in γH2AX levels in plates treated with
MK1775 plus drugs compared to drugs only (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, a few outliers with higher γH2AX levels
than the bulk of the samples were present, representing
potential candidate hits.
Notably, a few compounds induced high levels
of γH2AX even in the absence of MK1775 (Figure 1C,
top panel). We therefore had to discriminate between
synergistic versus additive effects of the compounds
in combination with MK1775. We calculated the
parameter γH2AXdiff, representing the γH2AX value after
treatment with the compound and MK1775 (Figure 1C,
bottom panel) minus the γH2AX value after treatment
with the compound alone (Figure 1C, top panel). Next,
we calculated the Z´-score (described in materials
and methods) for the γH2AXdiff values (Figure 1D,
Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S1).
The compounds with higher Z´ score values than 2.5
were listed as candidate hits (Figure 1E). The candidate
hits included multiple inhibitors of topoisomerase I and
II, three folic acid antagonists, two Chk1 inhibitors and
a few other drugs with diverse functions (Figure 1E).
Some of these compounds caused increased γH2AX
levels also in the absence of MK1775 (Supplementary
Figure S1B). We also listed the compounds with lower
Z´ score values than -2.0, i.e. the compounds that
decreased the MK1775-induced DNA damage in S-phase
(Supplementary Figure S1C and Supplementary Table
S1). Notably, five different CDK inhibitors were among
the compounds that caused decreased DNA damage

(Supplementary Figure S1C). The screen results were
thus highly consistent with our previous reports that the
S-phase damage induced upon Wee1 inhibition depends
on CDK activity [7, 9].
Strikingly, the Chk1 inhibitors AZD7762 and
LY2603618 were among the candidate hits. This indicates
that the recently reported synergistic antitumor effects of
simultaneous Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition [17–22] may be
caused by S-phase DNA damage. To validate this result,
we performed additional experiments with AZD7762 and
LY2603618 and two other Chk1 inhibitors (MK8776 and
UCN01), and one Chk2 inhibitor (PV1019). The latter was
included in order to discriminate between effects of Chk1
and Chk2, since AZD7762 can inhibit both kinases [26].
All four Chk1 inhibitors, but not the Chk2 inhibitor,
caused increased γH2AX in S-phase when combined with
MK1775 (Figure 1F). Of note, the highest concentration
of MK8776 (10 µM) appeared to decrease γH2AX
(Figure 1F), consistent with a CDK inhibitory function
of MK8776 at high concentrations [27]. We conclude that
combined inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 causes increased
DNA damage in S-phase in Reh cells.

in S-phase after combined Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition
(Figure 2E), consistent with halted replication. In contrast
to the pronounced S-phase effects, the combined treatment
gave only a modest increase in the percentages of mitotic
cells as examined by the mitotic marker phospho-H3
(Supplementary Figure S2A). Altogether, these data
strongly argue that the combined treatment of U2OS cells
with Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors synergistically increases
replication catastrophe, and that this may be the major
cause for the synergistic anti-tumor effects of these
inhibitors.
To address whether similar effects were found in
additional cell lines, we examined the lung cancer cell
lines H460, A549 and SW900. A previous study showed
widely variable growth inhibitory effects of MK1775
alone in these cells, H460 and A549 being the second and
third most resistant and SW900 the second most sensitive
of a panel of 70 lung cancer cell lines [11]. In response to
MK1775 as a single agent, we observed highest induction
of γH2AX in S-phase of SW900 and lowest in H460 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2B). For these three cell lines,
the induction of γH2AX therefore inversely correlates
with the published growth inhibition data, consistent
with the notion that growth inhibition may be associated
with DNA damage in S-phase [11]. All three cell lines
showed markedly increased S-phase DNA damage after
combined MK1775 and AZD7762 treatment, as judged
by either increased levels of γH2AX in S-phase cells
or by accumulation of cells with S-phase DNA content
(Supplementary Figure S2B). Thus, although the different
cell lines tested display variable inherent sensitivity
towards Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitors as single agents, the
combined treatment consistently strongly enhanced the
S-phase DNA damage.

Wee1 and Chk1 inhibition synergistically
enhances replication catastrophe
We next addressed the effects of combined Wee1
and Chk1 inhibition in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. These
cells were used in our previous studies of replication
catastrophe in response to Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors as
single agents [7, 9, 12]. Treatment of U2OS cells with
MK1775 in combination with AZD7762, LY2603618,
MK8776 or UCN01 caused a strong increase in induction
of γH2AX in S-phase compared to the inhibitors given
as single agents (Figure 2A, measured at 3 hours).
Clonogenic survival was also strongly reduced
(Figure 2B), indicating that the high S-phase DNA damage
after the combined treatment resulted in cell death. An
exposure time of 24 hours to the inhibitors was chosen
for the clonogenic survival assays to resemble a transient
delivery of such inhibitors upon in vivo single injections.
Furthermore, low concentrations of the inhibitors that
did not cause much reduction in survival by themselves
were used to clearly detect synergistic effects. The cells
with strong γH2AX staining were also Tunel-positive
(Figure 2C, measured at 3 hours), consistent with severe
damage and massive DNA breakage in S-phase. Of note,
although the Tunel assay commonly detects apoptosis,
similar Tunel-positive S-phase cells after Chk1 inhibition
alone did not show other typical features of apoptosis,
such as apoptotic nuclear morphology or induction of
caspase activity [12]. The S-phase cells with the strongest
γH2AX levels also showed high levels of phospho-RPA
S4/S8 staining (Figure 2D), indicating presence of single
stranded DNA. Moreover, cell cycle analysis at 0–9 hours
after treatment revealed massive accumulation of cells

Measurement of S-phase CDK activity upon
Wee1 and/or Chk1 inhibition
Wee1 and Chk1 are both negative regulators of CDK
activity, and increased CDK activity is regarded a common
mechanism behind replication catastrophe after individual
inhibition of each kinase [16, 28]. We previously found that
siRNA mediated partial depletion of either CDK1 or CDK2
reduced the S-phase DNA damage upon Wee1, as well as
Chk1, inhibition, suggesting that both CDK1 and CDK2
activities contribute to the effects [7]. To address how the
single and combined treatments affect CDK activity, we
first examined the inhibitory phosphorylation on Tyr15
in CDK1 and CDK2. Immunoblotting was performed on
parallel samples within the same experiment as in Figure 2A
collected at one hour after treatment. A pronounced
reduction in inhibitory phosphorylation on CDK1 was
detected after inhibition of Wee1 and Wee1/Chk1, but
not after Chk1 inhibition alone (Figure 3A, top panels).
The inhibitory phosphorylation on CDK2 was modestly
reduced after Wee1 inhibition, and even less so after Chk1

inhibition, whereas the combined treatment showed a small
reduction (Figure 3A, middle panels). We also examined
Cyclin E levels (Figure 3A, bottom panels). Since Cyclin
E is degraded in S-phase in a manner dependent on CDK2
activity, reduced Cyclin E levels may reflect increased
CDK2 activity [29]. We observed a small decrease in
Cyclin E levels after Chk1 inhibition (Figure 3A, bottom
panels), consistent with a slight increase in CDK2 activity.
Wee1 inhibition caused a similar or even stronger reduction
in Cyclin E levels, but Cyclin E levels were not more
reduced after the combined treatment. Taken together with
the measurements of γH2AX from Figure 2A, these results
suggest that the induction of DNA damage in S-phase does
not strictly correlate with CDK1 or CDK2 activity upon
inhibition of Wee1 and Chk1.
To further investigate this finding, we developed
a flow cytometry method to accurately measure
phosphorylation of CDK targets in individual S-phase
cells. In this method cells were stained with a DNAdye together with antibodies to previously reported
CDK2 targets (phospho-B-Myb [30, 31] and phosphoBRCA2 [32]) and CDK1 targets (phospho-MPM2 [33]),
to measure cell-cycle distribution and CDK activity,
respectively (Figure 3B). Addition of Wee1 or Wee1 plus
Chk1 inhibitors clearly increased the S-phase signals
with all three antibodies (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure S3). Furthermore, addition of the CDK1 inhibitor
RO-3306, the CDK2 inhibitor CVT-313 or the dual CDK1
and CDK2 inhibitor Roscovitine reduced the signals
(Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B), indicating that
these phosphorylations depend on both CDK1 and CDK2
activity. Cells were also co-stained with an antibody to
γH2AX to simultaneously measure the amount of DNA
damage. To eliminate potential errors caused by variation
in antibody staining, we employed barcoding with pacific
blue of sets of four samples.
This method allowed us to assess whether the
induction of DNA damage in S-phase correlated with
the increase in CDK activity. To investigate early events
after adding the inhibitors, cells were treated for one hour.
Consistent with our results obtained by immunoblotting,
Wee1 inhibition caused a higher increase in CDK activity
compared to Chk1 inhibition (Figure 3B). However,
Chk1 inhibition caused higher induction of γH2AX.
The combined treatment strongly enhanced γH2AX,
but showed no or only slight increase in CDK activity
compared to after Wee1 inhibition alone (Figure 3B).
Thus, the induction of DNA damage in S-phase upon
Wee1 and/or Chk1 inhibition does not show an overall
correlation with levels of CDK activity.

[16, 28], we next examined loading of the replication
initiation factor CDC45 after Wee1 and Chk1 inhibition.
CDC45 is limiting for replication initiation in humans
[34], and we previously showed that partial depletion of
CDC45 by siRNA transfection reduced the DNA damage
in S-phase upon Chk1 inhibition [12]. Immunoblotting of
nonextractable chromatin-bound CDC45 showed a small
increase in CDC45 loading after Wee1 inhibition alone,
but a markedly higher increase after Chk1 inhibition alone,
and the combined treatment further increased CDC45
loading (Figure 4A).
To more accurately measure CDC45 loading in
S-phase cells, we conducted flow cytometry analysis with
an antibody to CDC45 combined with a DNA-stain after
extraction of unbound proteins at one hour after treatment.
Again, barcoding of sets of four samples was included to
minimize sample-to-sample variations. Wee1 inhibition
gave a smaller increase in CDC45 loading compared to
Chk1 inhibition, and the combined treatment further
increased CDC45 loading (Figure 4B and 4C). Consistent
with increased replication initiation, measurements of
uptake of the nucleoside analog EdU in S-phase cells
followed the same pattern and was also most increased
upon the combined treatment (Supplementary Figure
S4A and S4B). Levels of γH2AX and phospho-B-Myb
were examined in parallel samples within the same
experiments to assess induction of DNA damage and
CDK activity, respectively. Again, we observed a strong
synergistic induction of DNA damage in S-phase upon
the combined treatment (Figure 4D), but no synergistic
increase of CDK activity (Supplementary Figure S4C).
When levels of CDC45 loading in S-phase cells at one
hour after treatment with MK1775 and AZD7762 as single
agents and in combination were plotted against γH2AX
levels, we observed a strong correlation between CDC45
loading and the induction of S-phase DNA damage (Figure
4E, left panel; Pearson coefficient: 0.89 (p < 0.0001)). In
contrast, γH2AX levels correlated less with CDK activity
measurements in the same experiments (Figure 4E, right
panel; Pearson coefficient: 0.54 (p = 0.005)). These results
are consistent with the notion that unscheduled replication
initiation is a major cause of the observed S-phase
DNA damage in response to Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitors.
Furthermore, the increased DNA damage in S-phase
upon combined Wee1 and Chk1 inhibition correlates with
increased CDC45 loading rather than with higher CDK
activity.

DISCUSSION
This study provides an explanation behind the
previously reported synergy between Wee1- and Chk1inhibitors observed in preclinical cancer treatment studies
[17–22]. Our results suggest that this synergy is due not
only to enhanced CDK activity, but also to an additional,
CDK-independent role of Chk1 in regulating CDC45

loading. According to this model, the activity of Chk1
suppresses CDC45 loading and thereby limits replication
catastrophe upon Wee1 inhibition alone (Figure 5A).
And upon Chk1 inhibition alone, Wee1 suppresses CDK
activity and thereby limits CDC45 loading (Figure 5B).
However, after inhibition of both kinases, both restraints
on CDC45 loading are removed, leading to massive
unscheduled replication initiation and subsequent
replication catastrophe (Figure 5C).
We have applied a novel assay to measure CDK
activity in S-phase (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure S3). The inclusion of multiple antibodies to
previously published CDK2 and CDK1 targets and
a DNA-stain to assess cell cycle position, together
with the bar-coding approach, enable highly accurate
measurements of CDK activity specifically in S-phase
cells. This method is an extension of our own previous
work with a single CDK target [35], and of others
investigating CDK target phosphorylation in mitosis
versus interphase [36]. The small increase in S-phase
CDK activity upon Chk1 inhibition alone (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Figure S4C) is in agreement with previous
reports that Chk1 suppresses CDK activity in unperturbed
S-phase, through negative regulation of CDC25A
phosphatase [12, 15, 28].
Of note, the antibodies used to detect inhibitory
phosphorylation (Figure 3A) may not be entirely specific
for CDK1 versus CDK2 [29], and some of the CDKtargets in Figure 3B may potentially be phosphorylated by
both CDKs. Nevertheless, with all the different readouts
we have used to assay CDK activity, our results show that
Wee1 is a more potent regulator of S-phase CDK activity
compared to Chk1 (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure
S4C). The exact distinction between CDK1 versus CDK2
activity also becomes less important since our previous
and present data strongly suggest that both CDK1 and
CDK2 contribute to cause the S-phase DNA damage:
Depletion of either CDK1 or CDK2 by siRNA reduced the
induction of γH2AX in response to Wee1, as well as Chk1,
inhibition [7], and inhibitors of either CDK1 (RO-3306)
or CDK2 (CVT-313) markedly reduced γH2AX after the
combined treatment (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B,
bottom panels).
The mechanisms by which Chk1 can suppress
CDC45 loading in the presence of high CDK activity
are intriguing. A CDK-independent function of Chk1 in
regulation of CDC45 loading was first described in cancer
cells exposed to the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol
epoxide [37]. Recent work has suggested that Chk1
negatively regulates the action of Treslin, a replication
factor positively stimulating CDC45 loading [38].
The expression of a mutant version of Treslin that could
not bind Chk1 caused increased replication initiation [38].
Based on these findings it seems plausible that Chk1mediated regulation of Treslin can contribute to suppress

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CDC45 loading. Notably, Wee1 inhibition causes
increased Chk1 activation (Supplementary Figure S4D
and [7]), which may further enhance the Chk1-mediated
suppression of CDC45 loading.
Interestingly, the combined treatment with Wee1
and Chk1 inhibitors caused massive DNA damage in
S-phase without causing premature mitosis (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure S2A). In contrast, a previous study
reported premature mitosis from S-phase upon combined
treatment of one breast cancer cell line with MK1775 and
AZD7762 [39]. However, the concentration of MK1775
(1 µM) was higher than in our experiments (300 nM) and
the incubation time with the inhibitors was longer (8 hours
compared to 3 hours in our experiments). Although we
cannot exclude that premature mitosis would happen at a
later timepoint in U2OS cells, our results clearly show that
the massive S-phase DNA damage induced by checkpoint
kinase inhibition is not a consequence of premature
mitosis.
In this study we present a novel flow cytometrybased screen for compounds that give synergistic DNA
damage in S-phase when combined with a Wee1 inhibitor.
The strength of our screening approach is the rapid analysis
of many thousands cells and accurate measurements of
γH2AX levels specifically in S-phase cells. The screen
identified several candidate hits, in addition to the Chk1
inhibitors, that have previously been reported to synergize
with Wee1 inhibition (Figure 1E). For example, preclinical
studies have shown that MK1775 potentiates the cytotoxic
effects of Camptothecin [40]. Furthermore, MK1775
combined with Irinotecan Hcl Trihydrate or Topotecan
Hcl are currently being tested in clinical trials (Clinical.
Trials.Gov). Moreover, three anti-folates were among the
candidate hits (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure S1D).
Since anti-folates cause nucleotide deficiency [41], the
results of our screen thus support and extend recent work
demonstrating a synthetic lethal interaction between Wee1
inhibition and low levels of the ribonucleotide reductase
subunit RRM2 [42]. In addition, our results show that
MK1775 can enhance the growth inhibitory effects of
Dasatinib (Supplementary Figure S1E). Altogether, this
strongly suggests that our screen efficiently identifies
compounds that synergize with MK1775.
In conclusion, a novel flow cytometry based
compound screen revealed synergistic DNA damage
in S-phase in cancer cells after simultaneous treatment
with Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitors. Our subsequent analysis
uncovered that this synergy can be explained by differential
functions of Wee1 and Chk1 in regulation of CDK activity
and CDC45 loading. Importantly, several of the Wee1
and Chk1 inhibitors used in this study are currently being
tested in clinical trials. Our work gives new knowledge
about how these inhibitors work as single agents and in
combination. These results can help optimizing the future
use of Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitors for cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

mouse IgG diluted 1:1000 (Molecular Probes), and finally
resuspended in 80 μl of Hoechst 33258 (1 µg/ml in PBS).
The stained plates were stored at 4°C in the dark overnight.
Flow cytometry analysis in the screen was performed
with an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped
with a BD High Throughput Sampler using the FACS
Diva Software version 6.1.3 (BD Biosciences) during
acquisition. The FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC) was used
during analysis. A region in S-phase was defined based on
the Hoechst signal, and the median γH2AX signal within
this region was obtained for all samples. To evaluate effects
of the drug libraries alone (Supplementary Figure S1B),
we calculated the Z-score for each sample (the number
of standard deviations away from the median γH2AX
sample value of the plate). The calculation of Z-score
values separately for each plate enabled comparison
of results across plates, despite variations between the
plates in overall signal intensity. To identify synergistic
effects between MK1775 and the drugs, we calculated the
parameter γH2AXdiff, representing the difference in γH2AX
levels between paired samples treated with drug library
only, and with MK1775 plus drug library [γH2AX diff =
γH2AX MK1775+drug - γH2AX drug]. Thereafter, we calculated
the Z score for each set of paired plates separately (denoted
Z´: the number of standard deviations away from the
median sample value of γH2AXdiff). Samples with higher
Z´ score values than 2.5 were considered as candidate hits
in the screen (Figure 1E).

Cell culture and drug treatments
Human NCI-H460 and A549 lung cancer (ATCC)
and U2OS osteosarcoma cells were cultured in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s) medium, and SW900 lung
cancer and Reh pre-B cell leukemia cells in RPMI (Roswell
Park Memorial Institute) medium (both media from Life
Technologies), at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (origin South America, Life Technologies)
and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies).
All cell lines (except Reh) were verified by STR (short
tandem repeat) technology as described previously [43].
The Wee1 inhibitor MK1775 (AZD1775) was from Merck
Calbiochem. The Chk1 inhibitors AZD7762, LY2603618
and MK8776 were from Selleck Chemicals, UCN01
was a gift from R.J. Schultz, National Cancer Institute,
and the Chk2 inhibitor PV1019 was from Millipore. The
dual CDK1/ CDK2 inhibitor Roscovitine and the CDK2
inhibitor CVT-313 were from Cell Signaling, and the
CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 from Merck Calbiochem.

Flow cytometry-based high-throughput screen
Aliquots of the LOPAC1280 Library of
Pharmacologically Active Compunds and the Selleck
Chem Cambridge Cancer Compound Library distributed
in 384-well plates (V-bottom #6008590, Perkin Elmer)
were obtained from the Chemical Biology platform,
Biotechnology Centre, University of Oslo part of the
NOR-OPENSCREEN infrastructure. The screen was
conducted at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Norwegian
Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital. A microplate
sample processor (Precision XS, BioTek) and microplate
washer (EL × 405 Select, BioTek) were used to facilitate
the cell seeding, fixation and staining. The final compound
concentration was 10 µM. Exponentially growing Reh
leukemia cells were seeded at 105 cells/100 µl medium
per well. Two parallel plates were processed and analyzed
together: one containing compounds only, and the other
containing an identical set of compounds plus the Wee1
inhibitor MK1775 (400 nM). Cells were incubated
for 4 hours at 37oC/5%CO2 and thereafter pelleted by
centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed once with
PBS, and 70 μl methanol per well was added for fixation.
The plates were then stored at −20°C until further analysis.
To measure DNA damage in S-phase, cells were stained
with an antibody to the DNA damage marker γH2AX
together with the DNA stain Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Cells
were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 20 μl
of mouse anti-phospho-H2AX(Ser139) antibody
(05-636, Millipore) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing
0.2% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 4% milk powder, followed
by 30 min incubation with 20 μl of Alexa Fluor 488 antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Flow cytometry analysis of CDK targets, CDC45
loading and DNA damage
For analysis of protein phosphorylation, cells were
fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with antibodies as
described previously [44]. The primary antibodies were
mouse anti-phospho-H2AX(Ser139) (05-636, Millipore),
rabbit anti-phospho-RPA (Ser4/Ser8)(A300-245, Bethyl
Laboratories), rabbit anti-phospho-H3(Ser10) (06-570,
Millipore), and three antibodies to CDK targets: rabbit
anti-phospho-BRCA2(Ser3291) (AB9986, Millipore),
rabbit anti-phospho-B-Myb(Thr487) (ab76009, Abcam)
and mouse anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro MPM-2 (05-368,
Millipore). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488
and 647 (Molecular Probes), Dylight 549 (VectorLabs)
and Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) anti-mouse and antirabbit IgG. For analysis of CDC45 loading, cells were
pre-extracted and fixed as described in [45], and stained
with anti-CDC45 (sc-55569, Santa Cruz) followed by
Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG. In experiments where
median values were measured, barcoding of sets of four
samples with pacific blue was used as before [35, 44]
to eliminate variation in antibody staining between the
individual samples. The DNA stain FxCycle™ Far Red
(200 nM FxCycle and 0.1mg/ml RNase A) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) was used in barcoding experiments,
and Hoechst 33258 (1.5 µg/ml) in other experiments. The
10976

Oncotarget

TUNEL TdT kit from Roche, Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) and
Streptavidin-Cy5 (GE Healthcare) were used according to
the manufacturer’s instruction, combined with antibody
staining of anti-phospho-H2AX(Ser139). Flow cytometry
analysis was performed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) using FACS Diva software. The Pearsons
correlation coefficient was calculated to quantify the
degree of correlation between parameters.

Clonogenic survival assays
Between 150 and 300 U2OS cells were seeded in
6cm culture dishes (BD Biosciences) in triplicate with
medium containing various concentrations of Wee1 and/or
Chk1 inhibitors. After 24 hours, the medium was replaced
by 4 ml fresh medium without inhibitors. Cells were then
cultured for an additional 13 days, fixed in 70% ethanol
and stained with methylene blue. Colonies of 50 or more
cells were counted as survivors. Survival fractions were
calculated in each experiment as the average cloning
efficiency (from 3 parallel dishes) after treatment with the
inhibitors, divided by the average cloning efficiency for
non-treated cells.

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in SDS boiling buffer (2% SDS, 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 µM Na3VO4), and immunoblotting
was performed as described previously [43]. The following
antibodies were used for blotting: mouse anti-CDK1 (9112,
Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-CDK2 (sc-163, Santa Cruz), rabbit
anti-phospho-CDK1(Tyr15) (9111, Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti-phospho-CDK2(Tyr15) (76147, Abcam), rabbit antiCyclinE (sc-198, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-CDC45 (sc-55569,
Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-phospho-Chk1(Ser296) (2349, Cell
Signaling) and mouse anti-γ-Tubulin (T6557, Sigma-Aldrich).
In experiments with pre-extraction of unbound proteins,
an extraction buffer (0.5% Triton, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4,
50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM Sucrose) was added for
5 minutes whilst the cells were kept on ice, before one wash in
ice-cold PBS, lysis and immunoblotting.
