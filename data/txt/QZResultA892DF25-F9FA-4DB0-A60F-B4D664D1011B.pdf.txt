Abstract
Functional alterations in Rad51C are the cause of the Fanconi anemia
complementation group O (FANCO) gene disorder. We have identified novel splice
variants of Rad51C mRNA in colorectal tumors and cells. The alternatively spliced
transcript variants are formed either without exon-7 (variant 1), without exon 6 and
7 (variant 2) or without exon 7 and 8 (variant 3).
Real time PCR analysis of nine pair-matched colorectal tumors and non-tumors
showed that variant 1 was overexpressed in tumors compared to matched nontumors. Among 38 colorectal tumor RNA samples analyzed, 18 contained variant 1,
12 contained variant 2, 14 contained variant 3, and eight expressed full length Rad51C
exclusively. Bisulfite DNA sequencing showed promoter methylation of Rad51C in
tumor cells. 5-azacytidine treatment of LS-174T cells caused a 14 fold increase in
variant 1, a 4.8 fold increase for variant 3 and 3.4 fold for variant 2 compared to 2.5
fold increase in WT.
Expression of Rad51C variants is associated with FANCD2 foci positive colorectal
tumors and is associated with microsatellite stability in those tumors. Further
investigation is needed to elucidate differential function of the Rad51C variants to
evaluate potential effects in drug resistance and DNA repair.

Introduction

cause of FA complementation group O (FANCO) disorder
with a similar phenotype as that seen in FA core complex
disorders, including defective DNA damage repair and
hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents [6-8].
In yeast, two hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation studies have shown a heterologous
interaction between the RAD51 paralogs forming two
stable protein complexes, a dimer consisting of Rad51CXRCC3 complex and a larger (BCDX2) complex
consisting of XRCC2, RAD51B, C and D [9,10]. Rad51C
is the only paralog existing in both complexes [11, 12].
In vitro, Rad51C is shown to have single stranded DNAdependent ATPase activity through a pairwise interaction
with RAD51B [13, 14], and also participates in resolution
of holiday junction intermediates by interacting with
XRCC2 and Rad51B during late stages of HR [15-17].

The Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway is an example of
homologous recombination (HR), repairing DNA damage
and maintaining genomic stability. Inherited genetic
alterations of FA complementation groups result in FA,
characterized by chromosomal instability, congenital
musculoskeletal abnormalities, bone marrow failure
and susceptibility to cancer [1]. Genetic studies have
demonstrated that monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and I by
an FA core complex (FANCA, B, C, E, F, G M and L)
is impaired during FA [2, 3]. Once monoubiquitinated,
FANCD2 and I co-localize with DNA damage response
proteins such as Rad51C (FANCO) to mediate HR repair
[4, 5]. Defects in Rad51C have been documented as the

Alternatively spliced isoforms have been
demonstrated to play different or even antagonistic
biological roles compared to the full length wild
type mRNA in a variety of systems [18-20]. Some of
the important diseases caused by cis acting or trans
acting protein splicing factors includes cystic fibrosis,
dementia, premature aging and cancer [21-24]. Functional
characterizations of splice variants of the DNA repair
gene Rad52 have previously been shown to increase direct
repeat recombination between sister chromatids exchange
more often expressed in human and yeast cells [25-27].
A variant of hRad51, hRad51delta ex9, resulting from a
frame shift mutation causing deletion of exon 9 has been
shown to promote higher DNA strand exchange activity
when compared to that of hRad51 [28]. Splice variants
for Rad51d have been shown to functionally interact with
BCDX2 complex in mice and mediate strand-annealing
reactions during HR [29, 30].
Although screening for Rad51 founder mutations
in patients with colorectal and prostate tumors have
shown no mutations [31], little is known of the potential
influence of splice variants of this gene in colorectal
tumors. Here we report the expression of splice variants
of Rad51C in colorectal tumors and cells and differences
in the expression of these variants between malignant and

normal phenotypes.

Results
Rad51C splice variants in colorectal tumors
To investigate the expression of Rad51C in tumors,
we isolated total RNA from colorectal tumors. RT-PCR
amplification of cDNA between exons 5 and exon 9 of
Rad51C using the primers ERF and ERR (Supplementary
Table S1) produced three products with sizes of 380 bp,
320bp and 260bp (Fig. 1A). The purified gel products
were subjected to TOPO TA cloning and subjected to
sequencing using universal primers. From the sequencing
analysis we identified three alternatively spliced variants
of the Rad51C gene. The alternatively spliced transcript
variant 1 is joined from the 3’-end of exon-6 to the 5’-end
of exon-8 (Fig. 1B), variant 2 is joined at the 3’- end of
exon-5 by the 5’-end of exon-8 (Fig. 1C), and variant 3 is
joined at the 3’-end of exon-6 with the 5’-end of exon-9
(Fig. 1D). A depiction of Rad51C short variants generated
by alternative splicing is shown in Fig. 2A.

Rad51C. B) Variant 1 without exon-7; C) Variant 2 without exon-6 and 7 and D) Variant 3 without exon-7 and 8.

Of the 38 colorectal tumors analyzed, 18 (47%)
tumors expressed variant 1, 12 (32%) tumors had variant
2 and 14 (37%) tumors expressed variant 3. The frequency
for each variant in tumors is indicated in Table 1.

To evaluate the expression of the alternatively
spliced variants in colorectal tumors, we designed variant
specific primers based upon the predicted sequences
of each cloned variant. The forward and reverse primer
sequence for variant 1, 2 and 3 with their respective
amplicon sizes is shown in Supplementary Table S1.

To quantitatively analyze the differential expression

we compared mRNA expression levels between tumors
and corresponding non-tumors using real time PCR.

Rad51C variants and FANCD2 foci

The real time PCR was performed using the primers as
mentioned in Supplementary Table S1. These primer pairs
amplify amplicons between 100bp and 200bp designed
for real time PCR. The 18S ribosomal rRNA was used
as endogenous control. Relative quantitative analysis of
the expression of short variants showed Rad51C variant
1 is over expressed in tumors as compared to non-tumor
tissue. On average, variant 1 RNA was 4.95 fold higher in
tumors. Variants 2 and 3 were expressed at 2.43 fold and
1.47 fold lower in tumors comparing to non-tumor tissues
(Fig. 3). In tumors, the relative expression for each variant
compared with wild type Rad51C was 8.05 fold higher
for variant 1, 1.81 fold higher for variant 3 and 1.72 fold
lower for variant 2 (Supplementary Figure S1).

We next evaluated if the expression of the Rad51C
variants correlates with FANCD2 foci formation. We
analyzed FANCD2 foci status and Rad51C variants
expression in colorectal tumors. Immunofluorescence
based FATSI triple staining [32] was used to evaluate
FANCD2 foci status. Among 38 tumors, 12 (32%) of
samples were noted to lack FANCD2 foci and 26 (68%)
tumors were FANCD2 foci positive.
Of the 12 FANCD2 foci negative tumors, Rad51C
variant 1 was present in two (17%) tumors; two tumors
(17%) had variant 2, and one tumor (8%) contained
variant 3 (Table 2). Among the 26 foci positive tumors,

was isolated from 9 colorectal tumors and non-tumors and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA was then used as template for Rad51C
variant expression analysis using the real time specific primers and SYBR green dye (Supplementary Table S1). On average variant 1 was
expressed 4.95 fold higher as compared to matched non-tumors. Wild type, variants 2 and 3 were expressed at lower levels. The expression
levels are given as relative RNA levels of each of the three variant in folds normalized by the expression level of the non-tumors.

Rad51C variant 1 was present in 16 (62%) tumors; 10
tumors (38%) had variant 2, and 13 tumors (50%) had
variant 3 (Table 2).

Among the 38 tumors, 34 were MSS tumors and four had
MSI. Among the 34 MSS tumors, 16 tumors expressed
variant 1, 11 variant 2, 13 variant 3, and seven had no
expression of the variants. Of the four MSI tumors,
two tumors expressed variants and the other two lacked
expression of variants. Variant 1 was expressed in two
tumors, while variant 2 and variant 3 were expressed
in one tumor, which expressed all three variants. The
two tumors with MSI without expression of Rad51C
variants were low grade, moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma, and had absence of MLH1 and PMS2
protein expression.

Rad51C variants expression and microsatellite
instability
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition
of genetic hypermutability that results from impaired
DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR). MSI is considered an
important molecular signature in colorectal cancers,
as those patients with MSI high (MSI-H) tumors had a
more positive prognosis compared to MSI low (MSI-L)
or Microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors [33]. Microsatellite
status was obtained from the surgical pathology report
based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis evaluating
expression of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 proteins
[34] in the 38 tumors examined for Rad51C variants.

Rad51C Promoter methylation in colorectal
tumors and cancer cells
We analyzed the promoter methylation pattern of
the Rad51C tumor suppressor gene in the colorectal tumor

Figure 4: Rad51C Promoter methylation analysis. The DNA was isolated from colorectal tumors and LS-174T cells pre and post
5-azacytidine treatment at a dose of 5µM for 72 hours. The DNA samples were bisulfite converted and PCR amplified using the primers that
amplify the Rad51C promoter region (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 30 CpG sites were located in the product. The PCR amplification
produced 408 bp product which is subjected to sequencing. A) The chromatogram for 408bp product showed methylation at three sites
in Rad51C promoter region in colorectal tumors and LS-174T cells. B) The electrophoresis gel image of the methylation specific PCR
(MS-PCR) amplification from tumors (T) and Non-tumors (NT) is shown. The Methylated DNA (Met) and Un-methylated DNA (UnMet)
is used as controls. The MS-PCR showed methylation in tumors as compared to non-tumors. C) The electrophoresis gel image of the Unmethylated DNA. The PCR amplification of bisulfite converted DNA from tumors (T) and Non-tumors (NT) is shown. The Un-methylated
DNA (UnMet) is used as control. D) The colorectal tumor cell LS-174T was treated with 5-azacytidine. Bisulfite sequencing showed demethylation at the three sites of Rad51C promoter region.

cells. Bisulfite sequencing was used for the analysis. The
promoter region of Rad51C is located on chromosome 17
(between nucleotide positions 56,769,721 and 56,770,129,
sequence accession number NC_000017.11). DNA
isolated from colorectal tumors and cells was bisulfite
treated as described in Materials and Methods. The
bisulfite treated DNA was PCR amplified to produce an
amplicon fragment of 408 bp using the primers BiProF;
BiProF, (Supplementary Table S1). The amplicon contains
30 CpG sites. The PCR amplified bisulfite treated DNA
was sequenced (BiProSeqF, BiProSeqR; Supplementary
Table S1). The sequence analysis of the bisulfite treated
DNA from six colorectal tumors showed three sites that
are methylated in the identical position in the promoter
region of Rad51C (Fig. 4A). We then analyzed LS-174T
colorectal tumor cells for Rad51C promoter methylation
and found the same sites methylated as seen in the
colorectal tumors. To evaluate the degree of methylation in
the promoter region of Rad51C, we conducted methylation
specific PCR (MS-PCR) analysis on 19 pair-matched
tumor and non-tumor samples. Four of the 19 pairs contain
detectable methylation in tumor samples only (Fig. 4B-C),
12 paired samples had no detectable methylation and three
paired samples contain detectable methylation in both
tumor and non-tumor by MS-PCR. The MS PCR primers
for methylated and un-methylated PCRs are shown in the
Supplementary Table S1.

In view of demonstration of several hypermethylated
CpG sites within the promoter of Rad51C, we wonder if
the expression of the observed Rad51C variants could be
altered by treatment with DNA hypomethylating agents.
To test this, we treated LS-174T cells with 5-azacytidine at
5µM for 72 hours. DNA was isolated and bisulfite treated.
A 408bp PCR product was amplified using the primers
BiProF and BiProR, (Supplementary Table S1). The PCR
amplified products were gel extracted and subjected to
sequencing using the primers, BiProSeqF and BiProSeqR
(Supplementary Table S1). Sequencing analysis confirmed
demethylation at three methylated CpG sites in the
promoter region of Rad51C (Fig. 4D).
To quantitatively analyze the effect of promoter
methylation on RNA expression of Rad51C variants, RNA
from azacytidine treated cells was reverse transcribed to
cDNA and analyzed with SYBR green real time PCR. The
real time PCR primers and respective amplicon sizes for
variant 1, 2 and 3 are described in Supplementary Table
S1. 18S ribosomal rRNA was used as endogenous control
in separate reactions. The real time PCR analysis of LS174T colorectal cells treated with 5-azacytidine, showed
a 14.3 fold and 4.8 fold increase in the expression of
variant 1 and 3, respectively in comparison to untreated
controls. The short variant 2 showed a 3.4 fold increase
in comparison to untreated controls. Wild type Rad51C
had only a 2.5 fold increase post 5-azacytidine treatment
compared to untreated controls (Fig. 5).

Figure 5: Real time PCR analysis of Rad51C variant expression in LS-174T colorectal tumor cells post 5-azacytidine
treatment. The LS-174T cells were treated with 5-azacytidine at dose of 5µM for 72 hours. The total RNA was isolated from pre and post

5-azacytidine treated LS-174T colorectal tumor cells and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA was then used as template for Rad51C
variant expression analysis using real time specific primers and SYBR green dye (Supplementary Table S1). The analysis showed 14.3 fold
increase in relative expression of RNA for variant 1, 3.4 folds for variant 2 and 4.8 folds for variant 3, and 2.5 folds increase for wild type.

Detection of Rad51C protein variants in colorectal
tumor cells

variants in this malignancy is limited. Recent studies
on the Rad51C gene have shown 14 germline sequence
alterations among 1100 breast and ovarian tumor samples
from patients [6]. Included in these germline alterations
is an alternatively spliced isoform of Rad51C without
exon-6. This isoform was shown to be involved in tumor
cell proliferation [6]. Herein we report the identification
of three Rad51C spliced transcript variants, in human
colorectal tumors. Variant 1 was overexpressed in tumors.
All three RAD51C variants contained an intact
N-terminus domain (exons 1-5). Several studies have
shown DNA dependent ATPase activity in the region
between exon 2 to exon 5 at aa 125 to132 of Rad51C
[10, 17]. Rad51C N-terminus domain is known to form
complexes with Rad51B, D and XRCC2 [13, 14], thus
variant 1 maintains protein to protein interactive functions.
We would hypothesize then that overexpression of variant
1 should stabilize the complex and facilitate DNA repair
and replication. To evaluate the biological function of the
variant 1, we performed In vitro transient overexpression
of Rad51C variant 1 in HCT116 colorectal tumor cells
(Supplementary Figures S2). A 1.8 fold increase in the
cell proliferation was recorded in the variant 1 expressing
cells as comparing to empty vector transfected controls
according to BrdU FACS analysis (Supplementary Figures
S3). In addition we evaluated the expression of Rad51C
variant 1 in cell proliferation with immunofluorescence
staining after labeling with BrdU. We found the cells
expressing Rad51C variant 1 had more BrdU positive cells
as comparing to cells transfected with empty vector and
non-transfected cells (Supplementary Figures S4). These
In vitro data suggest the Rad51C variant 1 may promote
cell proliferation in colorectal tumors.
	 Promoter methylation of Rad51C has been
shown in breast and ovarian cancer patients [38]. Here
we show promoter methylation of Rad51C in colorectal
tumor and LS-174T DNA samples. DNA methylation is

We established the predicted protein sequence of the
Rad51C variants by in silico translation using EMBOSS
[35]. Variant 1 RNA sequence predicted 46 amino acids
(aa) following the alternatively spliced exon-6 of Rad51C,
resulting in a new chimeric protein with a predicted
molecular weight of 41.6 KDa. The RNA sequence
analysis for Rad51C variant 2, post exon -5, showed 24
additional aa and terminates the protein producing a 33.6
KDa protein. Rad51C variant 3 generates a premature stop
codon terminating the protein at exon-9 with 4 aa post
exon-6 (Supplementary Table S2).
Protein was isolated from colorectal tumors,
matched non-tumors and LS-174T cells (Fig 6). The
protein was size fractionated on 4-12% SDS page gel and
blotted on nitrocellulose membrane. Rad51C wild type and
variant proteins were detected using a mouse monoclonal
Rad51C antibody that was predicted to recognize WT and
all of the putative variants. Western immunoblot analysis
showed that LS-174T cells contained a 47 KDa protein
(wild type) and a 41 KDa protein as predicted for Rad51C
variant 1, and a 33 KDa protein as predicted for variants
2 or 3. The analysis of proteins from colorectal tumors
showed similar variant expression pattern as in LS-174T
tumor cells. The analysis of non-tumor protein showed
expression of wild type and variant 2 or 3. Variant 1 was
not detected in non-tumor samples.

Discussion
Sequencing analyses have identified numerous
recurrently mutated genes and chromosomal translocations
in colorectal cancers [36, 37]. However, information
regarding the expression of alternatively spliced gene

and a 41 KDa for predicted Rad51C variant 1 and 33 KDa for predicted variant 2 or 3 (A). The analysis of proteins from colorectal tumor
showed similar variant expression pattern as in LS-174T tumor cells (B). The analysis of non-tumor protein showed expression of wild type
and variant 2 or 3. The variant 1 was absent in non-tumor protein (C).

known to exert multiple functions including regulation
of gene expression, determining alternate poly A choice
and tissue specific selection of alternate promoters [39].
It has been shown that Methyl CpG (MECP2) binding
proteins are enriched in alternatively spliced exons and
chemical or genetic disruption ablates the aberrant exon
skipping events [40]. Our results show that the Rad51C
variants expression was up regulated after treatment
with 5-azacytidine, a classic demethylation agent. This
indicates that Rad51C promoter methylation can regulate
the expression of variants in colorectal tumors. Further
investigation is needed to elucidate differential function
of the Rad51C variant 1, given its association with the
malignant phenotype, and its higher degree of response to
demethylation agents. Experiments to evaluate its potential
effect in drug resistance and DNA repair are under way in
our laboratory.

5-azacytidine was filter-sterilized and added directly to the
fresh cell culture media. Fresh 5-azacytidine was added
every 24 hours at dose of 5µM for 72 hours. The post
treatment cells were lysed, and the pellets were collected
and stored at -800 C.

The human tumor tissue samples were obtained
from the tissue procurement shared resources of The
Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center,
after institutional review board approval. Tumor
characteristics such as histology, tumor site and size as
well as microsatellite stability parameters were obtained
from the pathology report. The processed samples were

-800C freezer for RNA and DNA extraction.

Bisulfite sequencing and promoter methylation
Bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA from
colorectal tumors and cells was performed with EpiTect
96 Bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The promoter
region of Rad51C was retrieved from the Ensemble
browser (http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/). The
prediction of CpG islands and PCR primer sequences
were designed using Meth primer program [42]. PCR
amplification of the bisulfite DNA was performed in 25 µl
reaction using 1x methylation specific PCR buffer, 10mM
of dNTP mix, 0.4 µM of each forward and reverse primers,
1 µl of (~150ng) of bisulfite treated DNA sample and 0.4
µl of 1.0 unit Platinum ® Taq DNA polymerase following
the protocol from (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out with
initial heat denaturation step of 950C for 10 min, 38 cycles
of 950C for 30 s, annealing at 610C for 30 s, extension at
720C for 30 s and final extension step at 720C for 5 min.
The amplified products were gel extracted and purified
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, CA)
and subjected to sequencing using primers mentioned in
(Supplementary Table S1). The Methylation specific PCR
(MS-PCR) was carried out with EpiTect MSP kit (Qiagen,
CA) using the 2X master mix following the manufacturer
recommendations. The PCR was carried out with initial
heat denaturation step of 950C for 10 min, 38 cycles of
950C for 15 s, annealing at 510C for 30 s, extension at 720C

RNA and DNA analysis
The total RNA and DNA were isolated by
homogenization and sequential precipitation following
the protocol from TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, CA).
The RNA and DNA obtained from the colorectal tumor
tissue samples was quantified at absorbance 260nm and
280 nm using Nanodrop 2000C (Thermoscientific, DE).

RT-PCR
The RT-PCR primers were designed using the

Supplementary Table S1. The cDNA was used as template
and the final reaction consisted of 1x SYBR green master
mix, 10pmol/µl of forward and reverse primers. Also
human 18S rRNA is used as internal control in separate
reactions.

Equal amount of proteins were size-fractionated
on 4-12% NuPAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with
blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk). The blocked membrane
was then incubated with target mouse monoclonal Rad51C
antibody (Sigma Aldrich®, MO) at 40C overnight. After
washing the membrane with TBS-T (20mM Tris,
0.9%Nacl) for three times 30 minutes each, the membrane
was then incubated with anti- mouse secondary antibody
(Sigma Aldrich®, MO) for 1 h at room temperature. After
washing five times, 10 minutes each, a chemiluminescent
detection system (ECL western blotting detection reagents,
GE Healthcare) was used to detect the secondary antibody.
Finally the membranes were exposed to x-ray films.
