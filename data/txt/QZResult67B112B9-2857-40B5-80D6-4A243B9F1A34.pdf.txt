ABSTRACT
The aggressive biological behavior of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and its short
response to current treatment highlight a great need for better rational therapy.
Herein, we investigate the ability of ABT-199, the Bcl-2-selective BH3 mimetic,
to kill MCL cells. Among MCL cell lines tested (n = 8), only three were sensitive
(LD50 < 200 nM). In contrast, all primary MCL samples tested (n = 11) were highly
sensitive to ABT-199 (LD50 < 10 nM). Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL both confer resistance to
ABT-199-specific killing and BCL2/(BCLXL+MCL1) mRNA ratio is a strong predictor
of sensitivity. By mimicking the microenvironment through CD40 stimulation, we
show that ABT-199 sensitivity is impaired through activation of NF-kB pathway and
Bcl-xL up-regulation. We further demonstrate that resistance is rapidly lost when MCL
cells detach from CD40L-expressing fibroblasts. It has been reported that ibrutinib
induces lymphocytosis in vivo holding off malignant cells from their protective
microenvironment. We show here for two patients undergoing ibrutinib therapy that
mobilized MCL cells are highly sensitive to ABT-199. These results provide evidence
that in situ ABT-199 resistance can be overcome when MCL cells escape from the
lymph nodes. Altogether, our data support the clinical application of ABT-199 therapy
both as a single agent and in sequential combination with BTK inhibitors.

additional mechanisms are required for MCL progression,
including alteration of the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway, which mainly determines cell fate [4–6]. Among
the critical components of the apoptotic machinery, the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is overexpressed in MCL
cells and may then represent an attractive target for
innovative therapy. BH3 mimetics, such as ABT-737
and ABT-263 (navitoclax), which bind with high affinity
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been developed. They displace
pro-apoptotic proteins from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and induce
apoptosis through a Bax or Bak dependent manner [7, 8].
Recently, navitoclax has demonstrated antitumor activity

INTRODUCTION
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a mature B-cell
neoplasm characterized by an aggressive clinical course.
Although recent progress in the treatment of MCL
patients has yielded high complete response rates, relapse
invariably occurs and MCL remains incurable [1, 2].
This highlights the necessity to uncover the mechanisms
involved in tumor cell survival and drug resistance.
The primary oncogenic event in MCL is the t(11;14)
translocation resulting in cyclin D1 overexpression
and consequent cell cycle dysregulation [3]. However,

BCL2/BCL2XL mRNA ratios were sufficient
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), BCL2/(MCL1+BCLXL)
mRNA ratio discriminated sensitive from resistant MCL
cells with a cut-off value of 0.67 (p < 0.001; Fig. 1B).
Of note, the Bcl-2/(Mcl-1+Bcl-xL) protein ratio strongly
correlated with the mRNA ratio in MCL cells (p < 0.001;
Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1C). Taken together, these data
suggest that both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression play a role
in ABT-199 resistance in MCL through increase of the
apoptotic threshold.
To investigate the role of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in
ABT-199 response, these anti-apoptotic proteins were
knocked down using siRNA in both Z138 and JeKo-1
resistant cells. Mcl-1 silencing sensitized both cell lines
to lower doses of ABT-199 confirming the critical role of
Mcl-1 in BH3-mimetics resistance as previously shown
(Fig. 1C) [18]. Bcl-xL silencing also sensitized Z138 and
JeKo-1 cells to ABT-199, to a lesser extent than Mcl-1
silencing which may be explained by a lower silencing
efficacy (Fig. 1C–1D). These results confirm that both
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 determine ABT-199-specific response
in MCL cells.

in B-cell malignancies but its clinical development was
limited by the significant thrombocytopenia caused by
Bcl-xL inhibition [9]. To overcome this toxicity, the firstin-class orally bioavailable Bcl-2-selective BH3 mimetic
ABT-199 was developed and thus far has shown very
promising antitumor activity while sparing platelets in
chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and B-cell lymphomas,
including MCL [10, 11].
Recently it has been demonstrated that tumor
microenvironment strongly influence proliferation,
survival and drug resistance in MCL cells [12, 13].
Moreover, microenvironment has been implicated in
BH3 mimetic resistance via the modulation of Bcl-2
family proteins expression in CLL cells [14–16]. In the
present study, we investigated the apoptotic efficiency
of ABT-199 in both MCL cell lines and primary cells by
integrating the key role of the microenvironment. This led
us to propose a rational combination strategy to overcome
microenvironment-dependent ABT-199 resistance through
prior induction of cellular egress in peripheral blood using
the selective BTK inhibitor ibrutinib [17].

RESULTS

CD40 stimulation reduces ABT-199
efficacy in MCL cells

Mantle cell lymphoma sensitivity to ABT-199
correlates with BCL2/(MCL1+BCLXL) gene
expression ratio

Because MCL cells mainly reside in lymph nodes
we next asked whether microenvironment interactions
could impact their sensitivity to ABT-199. In order to
mimic the lymph node microenvironment where CD40CD40L interaction takes place, ABT-199 sensitive MCL
cell lines (MINO and MAVER-1) were cultured on
CD40L-expressing fibroblast L cells (L-40L). Co-culture
with L-40L dramatically reduces their sensitivity to ABT199 while co-culture with parental fibroblast L cells failed
to induce significant resistance (Fig. 2A). Of note, primary
MCL cells from patients were also significantly more
resistant to ABT-199 when cultured on L-40L with 25 nM
of ABT-199 (n = 6; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). By contrast,
culture of MINO cells with conditioned medium from
L-40L culture or with bone marrow stromal cells (HS5)
failed to reduce ABT-199 sensitivity (data not shown).
These results indicate that the CD40 pathway is directly
involved in the resistance to ABT-199 in both MCL cell
lines and primary cells.

To determine sensitivity of MCL cells to ABT199, cell lines (n = 8) were treated with increasing doses
of ABT-199 for 48 hours. As shown in Table 1A, the
efficacy of ABT-199 was heterogeneous among MCL
cell lines. Indeed, MAVER-1, MINO and GRANTA-519
cells were found to be highly sensitive to ABT-199 (LD50
from 15 to 200 nM) while Z138, JeKo-1, REC-1, JVM2
and UPN-1 were found to be resistant (LD50 from 1000
to 10000 nM) (Table 1A). We next addressed ABT-199
sensitivity in primary MCL cells obtained from peripheral
blood of 11 patients at diagnosis or relapse. In contrast to
MCL cell lines, low doses of ABT-199 (10 nM) induced cell
death in all samples, ranging from 53% to 98% indicating
that primary cells presented a LD50 < 10 nM (Table 1B).
We next analyzed the sensitivity to ABT-199 in
regards to the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members determined by RT-qPCR in both cell lines and
primary samples (Table 1). Whereas BCL2 and MCL1
levels were similar in both cell lines and primary cells,
BCLXL mRNA expression was significantly lower in
primary MCL cells (p = 0.002) (Fig. 1A). We previously
reported that the BCL2/MCL1 ratio was a powerful
biomarker for predicting ABT-737 sensitivity in MCL
[18]. Using both MCL cell lines and primary cells
we found here a direct correlation between ABT-199
sensitivity threshold and MCL1 and BCLXL anti-apoptotic
gene expression. Indeed, whereas neither BCL2/MCL1 nor

To assess the involvement of Bcl-2 family proteins
in ABT-199 resistance under CD40 stimulation, we
examined their expression following co-culture with either
L or L-40L fibroblasts. CD40 stimulation of ABT-199
sensitive MCL cell lines resulted in a strong up-regulation
of Bcl-xL proteins within 6 to 24 hours of co-culture while

Table 1: MCL cell sensitivity to ABT-199 correlates with the BCL2/(MCL1+BCLXL) ratio. (A) Cell
lines were cultured with increasing doses of ABT-199 for 48 hours to determine the median lethal
dose (LD50: 15-10000 nM). (B) MCL cells from peripheral blood were obtained after gradient density
centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque. MCL cells were cultured with 10 nM of ABT-199 for 24 hours.
Diag: diagnosis, Rel: relapse, ND: data not determined. The relative expression of BCL2, MCL1 and
BCLXL mRNA was defined on purified CD19+ cells as described in the Methods section and BCL2/
(MCL1+BCLXL) mRNA ratio is indicated. Analysis of BCLXL, MCL1 and BCL2 relative expression in
primary MCL cells and cell lines are shown in Figure 1A. Correlation between BCL2/(MCL1+BCLXL)
ratio and ABT-199 sensitivity is shown in Figure 1B.
no modification of Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 levels was observed
(Fig. 3A). The CD40-induced Bcl-xL expression was then
confirmed at the mRNA level in MINO and MAVER-1
cell lines (Fig. 3C).
CD40 activation is known to potently activate both
classical and alternative NF-kB pathway [19], which

mediate Bcl-xL upregulation [20]. Thus, we investigated
NF-kB activation through the phosphorylation of IκBα
and accumulation of p52 in MCL cell lines under CD40
stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3A both classical (p-IkB)
and alternative (p52) NF-kB pathways were activated
under CD40 stimulation in both MINO and MAVER-1

Because MCL cells frequently disseminate from
lymph nodes into circulation, we mimicked this process
by removing MINO or primary MCL cells from L40-L

By inhibiting BCR and chemokine-mediated stromal
adhesion of MCL, ibrutinib has been shown to induce
a redistribution of lymph node-resident MCL [22].
Thus, we investigated the lymphocyte population in
the peripheral blood of a patient that received ibrutinib
(560 mg/d) every day for days 1–7 while treated in the
French compassionate use program. Blood was collected
and analyzed for the presence of CD19+ CD5+ MCL cells
before treatment and at days 2 and 7 following ibrutinib
treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, the peripheral CD19+ CD5+
lymphocyte population increased from 16% to 21% after
2 days and to 61% after 7 days of ibrutinib treatment,
indicating a cellular mobilization (lymphocytosis) from
tissues as previously described (Fig. 4A) [22]. Annexin-V
staining demonstrated that only 9% or 25% of the tumor
cell population undergoes spontaneous apoptosis at
days 2 and 7 following ibrutinib treatment respectively

detachment from L40-L. We observed a rapid decrease of
IkBα phosphorylation as well as a progressive reduction
of p52 and Bcl-xL protein level to baseline levels within
24 hours after detachment from L40-L (Fig. 3E–3F).
Taken together, these results suggest that ABT-199
resistance due to CD40/CD40L interaction is linked to
Bcl-xL upregulation and that sensitivity could be rapidly
restored after egress of MCL cells from their protective
microenvironment.

(Fig. 4A). In order to analyze the cytotoxic efficiency of
ABT-199 on tumor cells mobilized from lymph nodes,
peripheral blood population obtained on day 7 was treated
with increasing doses of ABT-199 for 24 hours. We
found that the CD19+ population was highly sensitive to
ABT-199, with a LD50 < 1 nM, confirming that tumor
cells mobilized from tissues following ibrutinib treatment
could be efficiently targeted by ABT-199 (Fig. 4B). The
ABT-199 sensitivity of ibrutinib-mobilized cells was
further confirmed in a second patient who displayed an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increase absolute lymphocyte count (1.9 fold) 10 days
after ibrutinib (Supplementary Figure S2A–S2C). Ex-vivo
co-culture of the peripheral blood population obtained on
day 7 on L-40L confirmed ABT-199-resistance (Fig. 4B,
Supplementary Fig. S2C) as well as NFkB activation and
Bcl-xL up-regulation (Fig. 4C). Thus, we hypothesize that
without ibrutinib-specific inhibition of homing into the
lymph nodes, circulating cells would become resistant to
ABT-199. According to our hypothesize, we demonstrated
that while ibrutinib increased the sensitivity of Mino cells

significantly reverse the protection observed on L-40L
co-culture (Supplementary Fig. S3).

to MAVER-1 and GRANTA-519 cells, indicating that the
efficacy of ABT-199 is not affected by the absence of Bim
(data not shown).
It was shown recently that ibrutinib, a highly potent
oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, interferes
with the homing of MCL cells into secondary lymphoid
organs and/or bone marrow through the inhibition of
chemokine and BCR signaling [22]. In agreement with
this mechanism of action, ibrutinib induces a concomitant
increase of circulating MCL cells [22]. Since circulating
primary MCL cells are highly sensitive to ABT-199, it
would suggest that combining ABT-199 with ibrutinib
could be a very effective therapy for MCL patients.
Indeed, we have demonstrated that ABT-199 resistance
is rapidly lost when MCL cells detach from CD40L
expressing fibroblast cells and that peripheral MCL cells
isolated from a patient undergoing ibrutinib treatment
were sensitized to ABT-199-mediated killing. Taken
together, these results indicate that ABT-199 resistance
can be overcome when MCL cells escape from the
microenvironments (Fig. 4D).
Based on high response rates in a phase 2 clinical
data, ibrutinib was recently approved by the FDA for the
treatment of MCL [21]. However, approximately one third
of patients did not respond and some became resistant to
ibrutinib during treatment [21, 27, 28]. Because ABT-199
kills MCL cells through a distinct mechanism of action
and is particularly potent against peripheral MCL cells
mobilized by ibrutinib, these agents could be highly
complementary and beneficial to patients with significant
unmet medical need. Their favorable toxicity profiles may
also facilitate their combination in future clinical trials.
Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated synergistic
effect of the ibrutinib and ABT-199 combination on
apoptosis induction in several MCL cell lines [29].
However, while ibrutinib increased the sensitivity of
Mino cells to ABT-199, this drug combination was not
sufficient to reverse the protection induced by the CD40/
CD40L interaction. These last results reinforce the interest
of sequential strategy taking advantage of ibrutinibinduced lymphocytosis.
In conclusion, the Bcl-2-selective BH3 mimetic
ABT-199 is a promising agent for the treatment of B-cell
malignancies including MCL and may be especially
attractive in combination with BCR signaling inhibitory
drugs such as ibrutinib, which can drive malignant cells
out of the protective microenvironment of lymph nodes
and bone marrow.

DISCUSSION
The opportunity to induce apoptosis by selectively
targeting Bcl-2 with ABT-199 is a potentially promising
therapeutic approach in hematological malignancies
[10, 23, 24]. MCL cell lines showed a similar
sensitivity to ABT-199 than the one previously described
for ABT-737  [18], despite the selective affinity of
ABT-199 for Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL. However, ABT-199
efficiency may be increased thanks to a higher affinity
to its selective target Bcl-2 (x100 fold) [10]. Indeed, we
observed that ABT-199 kills 3 out of 8 MCL cell lines
while it is broadly active against all primary MCL cells
tested (n = 11) at low doses (LD50 < 10 nM) (Table 1). We
next demonstrated that ABT-199 sensitivity is significantly
correlated to BCL2/(MCL1+BCLXL) ratio indicating that
both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL play a key role in intrinsic ABT-199
resistance (Fig. 1). Of note, until now we didn’t observe
intrinsic resistance to ABT-199 in the primary MCL cells
tested. However, analysis of a larger number of primary
cells could potentially reveal ABT-199 resistance due to
specific mutation in the Bcl-2 target or in Bax effector
protein as recently reported [25].
Accumulating
data
indicate
that
the
microenvironment is a critical factor for cancer cell
survival and thus has to be considered for the development
of successful new treatment strategies. In this respect,
special attention has been paid to modifications occurring
in CLL cells stimulated by fibroblasts expressing CD40L,
resulting in ABT-737 resistance [14, 15, 26]. Using this
coculture system to mimic the microenvironment within
lymph nodes, we have shown here that CD40 stimulation
of MCL cell lines and patient samples significantly
reduce ABT-199 sensitivity (Fig. 2). We demonstrated
that (i) peripheral blood MCL cells express low level of
Bcl-xL and are highly sensitive to ABT-199, (ii) upon
CD40 stimulation there is an increase in Bcl-xL protein
level but not Mcl-1 or Bcl-2, and (iii) that silencing of
BCL-xL overcomes ABT-199 resistance induced by CD40
stimulation. Taken together our study highlight a critical
role for Bcl-xL in microenvironment-dependent protection
of MCL cells to ABT-199.
As previously reported [20], we confirmed that
NF-κB-signaling pathway is involved in CD40-dependent
Bcl-xL up-regulation (Fig. 3). Mechanistically, our
results imply that over-expression of Bcl-xL alters the
balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins and it is the tempting to hypothesize that Bcl-xL
is able to capture the pro-apoptotic proteins endogenously
bound to Bcl-2 and released under ABT-199 treatment. Of
note, among the three MCL cell lines highly sensitive to
ABT-199, MINO cells lacks Bim expression in contrast

(Lyon, France). L cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM glutamine.
For the co-culture experiments, L cell were irradiated
with 35 Gray or treated with mitomycin and seeded
(2.5 × 104 cells/mL) 6 to 24 hours before MCL cell lines
(2.5 × 105 cells/mL) or primary cells (5 × 105 cells/mL).
ABT-199 was then added for 48 hours.

V-FITC staining (Beckman coulter). Fluorescence was
analyzed on FACSCalibur (Cytocell, SFR Bonamy).

siRNA transient transfections
Control non-targeted small interfering siRNA (si Ct)
and siRNA against BCLXL and MCL1 were purchased
from Thermo Scientific (Courtaboeuf, France). Z138 and
MINO cell lines were electroporated using a Nucleofector
system (Amaxa, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells (5 × 105/ml) were
suspended in Nucleofector solution T or SF and
electroporated in the presence of 10 μmol/L siRNA (T01
for MINO, CM150 for Z138 and DN100 for JeKo-1).
The gene-silencing effect was evaluated by immunoblot
analysis.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative PCR was performed as previously
described [30]. TaqMan gene expression assays for BCL2
(Hs00608023_m1), MCL1 (Hs00172036_m1), BCLXL
(BCL2L1; Hs00236329_m1) and RPL37a (Hs01102345_
m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The
following thermal cycling parameters were used: 50°C
for 2 min for optimal AmpErase UNG activity and
then 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 s and 60°C for 1 min.
Amplification of the housekeeping gene RPL37a was
conducted for each sample as an endogenous control.

Antibodies and reagents

Immunoblot analysis

The following antibodies were used for flow
cytometry analysis: anti-Apo2.7-PE, anti-CD5-FITC, antiCD19-APC and control IgG1-FITC mAbs were purchased
from BD Biosciences (Le Pont de Claix, France). Analysis
of protein expression was conducted by immunoblotting
using the following primary antibodies: anti-Bcl-2,
anti-IκBα and anti-phosho-IκBα (Cell Signaling, Saint
Quentin en Yvelines, France), Anti-Mcl-1 (S19) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Bcl-xL (BD
Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France), Anti-NF-κB p52
Antibody and anti-actin (Merck Millipore, Lyon, France).
ABT-199 was kindly provided by Abbvie Laboratories
(North Chicago, IL, USA) and the selective BTK
inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765) was obtained from Selleck
Chemicals (Souffelweyersheim, France).

Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer
containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA and 1% TritonX100, 2 mM PMSF and 2 mg/ml
aprotinin. Immunoblot analysis was performed according
to published protocols [18].

Cell death in MCL cell lines was assessed by using
Apo-2.7 staining (BD Biosciences Le Pont de Claix,
France). Cell death in CD19+ primary MCL cells was
assessed by Apo-2.7 staining combined with an analysis
of altered cellular morphology (lower FSC). Alternatively,
apoptosis of primary cells was assessed by Annexin
