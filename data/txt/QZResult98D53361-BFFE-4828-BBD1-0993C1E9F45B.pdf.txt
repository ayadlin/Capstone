BACKGROUND: Liver metastases in patients with cancer are associated with poor survival. The authors of this report
conducted a phase 1 study of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) oxaliplatin combination therapy in patients with
advanced cancer and liver metastases. METHODS: Treatment consisted of escalating doses of HAI oxaliplatin 60 mg/
m2 to 175 mg/m2 and intra-arterial heparin 3000 IU (Day 1); leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenously (iv) and 5-fluorouracil 300 mg/m2 bolus plus 600 mg/m2 iv (Days 1 and 2); and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg iv (Day 3). A conventional ‘‘3 þ
3’’ design was used. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were treated, including 30 women and 27 men. The median age
was 57 years, and the patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-7 prior therapies). The most common cancer was colorectal (n ¼ 29). Overall, 204 cycles were administered (median per patient, 2 cycles; range, 1-17
cycles). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HAI oxaliplatin was 140 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4
thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 1) and grade 4 hypokalemia (n ¼ 1) at 150 mg/m2 (n ¼ 5). Thirty-three patients (58%) had no
toxicity greater than grade 1. The most common toxicities were thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 19), fatigue (n ¼ 15), nausea/
vomiting (n ¼ 6), constipation (n ¼ 6), and diarrhea (n ¼ 4). Of 55 patients who were evaluable for response (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), 4 patients (7%) had a partial response (PR), and 32 patients
(58%) had stable disease (SD), including 15 patients (48%) who had SD for 4 months. Of 28 patients with colorectal
cancer, 3 patients (11%) had a PR, and 9 patients (32%) had SD for 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: HAI oxaliplatin combined with systemic 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab had antitumor activity in patients with advanced
cancer and liver metastases, and the current results indicated that this combination warrants further study. Cancer

The presence of liver metastases in patients with solid tumors is associated with a poor prognosis. Overall, 15% to 25%
of patients with colorectal cancer present with liver metastases, and another 25% to 50% develop hepatic metastasis after
resection of the primary tumor.1-3 The use of liver resection alone in patients with liver metastases is limited by the number of patients with resectable disease at presentation, because most patients develop recurrent disease in the liver and/or
extrahepatic sites.4
Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) has been used in the treatment of incurable cancer by Sullivan et al since the 1950s.5
The rationale for HAI is based on the concept that malignant lesions derive most of their blood supply from the hepatic

artery in contrast to normal hepatocytes, which are supplied through the portal venous circulation.6 It is believed
that cytotoxic agents administered through the hepatic artery are extracted in their initial pass through the hepatic
parenchyma, thus maximizing their antitumor activity in
the liver metastases.6
In 1989, a controlled clinical trial of 5-fluoro-20 deoxyuridine (FUDR) for hepatic metastases of colorectal
carcinoma as continuous intra-arterial/intravenous (iv)
therapy prevented extrahepatic spread during therapy in
most patients, resulting in prolonged survival.7 In subsequent clinical trials, regional adjuvant therapy with
FUDR reportedly improved survival in patients with
colorectal cancer and liver involvement.8-10 In a randomized trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB]
9481), HAI therapy was associated with higher rates of
response (P ¼ .01) and survival (P ¼ .003) compared
with systemic therapy.11
In 2000, using the human tumor colony-forming
assay in liver tumors, significant concentration-dependent
inhibition of colony formation occurred after a 2-hour exposure to oxaliplatin, suggesting that patients with colorectal or pancreatic liver metastases may benefit from HAI
with oxaliplatin.12 In addition, studies in rabbits had
demonstrated that HAI of oxaliplatin was associated with
a 4.3 times higher concentration in liver tumors compared
with normal liver tissue.13 Pharmacokinetic studies in
humans demonstrated a liver extraction ratio of 0.47 for
oxaliplatin administered through the hepatic artery.14
Clinical studies of HAI oxaliplatin combined with
iv 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin also have produced encouraging results in patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases.15-18 Bevacizumab has antitumor
activity in a broad spectrum of tumors, and it improves
survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.
Therefore, we conducted a phase 1 study of HAI
oxaliplatin combined with systemic 5-FU/leucovorin and
bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors metastatic to the liver. The primary objectives were to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of oxaliplatin and to assess toxicity.
We also assessed response or clinical benefit, if any.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From August 2006 to November 2008, 57 patients were
treated on protocol. Eligibility criteria included patients
who were seen in the Phase 1 Clinical Trials Program at
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
Cancer

September 1, 2010

with histologically confirmed, advanced cancer (any type)
and liver metastases who had failed at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. Other eligibility criteria included an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
between 0 and 2; at least 3 weeks after completion of previous therapy; baseline toxicity grade 1; and adequate
renal (serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL), hepatic (total bilirubin 3 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase level 5 times the upper normal reference value),
and bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count
1.5  109/L; platelet count 100  109/L).
Patients were excluded because of pregnancy; peripheral neuropathy (grade 2); serious wound; history of
abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess; major surgical procedure within 28
days before therapy; bleeding diathesis; active gastric/duodenal ulcer; uncontrolled intercurrent illness or hypertension; 24-hour urine protein >1 g; history of
cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months; myocardial infarction/unstable angina within the past 6
months, New York Heart Association grade 2 congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia, and clinically
significant peripheral vascular disease; or history of bleeding brain metastasis.
Before enrollment, all participants signed informed
consent forms that fully disclosed the investigational nature of the trial. Patients aged < 18 years (excluding those
aged <7 years) signed assent forms, and the parent/guardian signed consent. The study protocol was approved by
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board.
Treatment
Patients were admitted for treatment at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. A hepatic intra-arterial catheter was placed by an interventional radiologist
using the femoral approach. A 5-French angiographic
catheter was used to select the celiac and/or superior mesenteric artery, and a coaxial 3-French microcatheter was
advanced into the desired hepatic artery. Hepatic artery
flow evaluation was then performed in all patients after
the injection of 5 mCi technetium-99m macroaggregated
albumin particles through the HAI catheter, which was
used to simulate the distribution of chemotherapeutic
agents. Once extrahepatic flow was excluded and appropriate hepatic distribution was confirmed, patients were
transferred to the inpatient unit for initiation of HAI therapy. The nuclear medicine flow study also was used to
identify any evidence of extrahepatic flow to reduce the

4087

Original Article

risk of gastrointestinal complications. When issues were
identified on the nuclear medicine flow study, patients
were returned to interventional radiology for evaluation
and catheter repositioning. Right common femoral arterial access was used routinely for each session. The catheter was removed at the end of the oxaliplatin infusion.
Patients were treated as follows: On Day 1, patients
received escalating doses of HAI oxaliplatin from 60
mg/m2 to 175 mg/m2 intra-arterially over 2 hours and
3000 U of heparin intra-arterially; on Days 1 and 2,
patients received leucovorin 200 mg/m2 iv and a 300-mg/
m2 bolus of 5-FU plus 600 mg/m2 5-FU in 250 mL dextrose 5% in water as a continuous iv infusion over 22
hours; and, on Day 3, patients received bevacizumab 10
mg/kg iv over 60 minutes. Dexamethasone at 10 mg iv
before the oxaliplatin dose and for 2 days afterward and
antinausea medications were administered. The oxaliplatin dose escalation scheme was as follows: 60 mg/m2, 80
mg/m2, 100 mg/m2, 120 mg/m2, 140 mg/m2, 150 mg/
m2, 160 mg/m2, and 175 mg/m2. Cycles were repeated
every 3 weeks.

Patient Monitoring
Patients were monitored every 3 weeks by physical examination, hematology and chemistry laboratory studies, vital
signs, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Tumors were
staged before treatment and after every 2 cycles of therapy.

RESULTS

Endpoints and Statistical Considerations
The study originally was designed using a conventional ‘‘3
þ 3’’ design followed by an expansion phase comprised of
31 patients. Toxicities were assessed using the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version
3.0.19 DLTs were assessed during the first cycle. The use
of growth factors was acceptable during the clinical study.
Response was assessed by a University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Radiologist using computed tomography imaging studies every 2 cycles of therapy (1 cycle ¼
3 weeks) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.20 Waterfall plot analysis
was used to illustrate antitumor activity, as described previously.21 Responses illustrated in the waterfall plot were
grouped according to standard RECIST criteria.
Survival was measured from the start of treatment
on protocol until death from any cause or last follow-up.
Progression-free survival was measured from the start of
treatment on protocol until progression or death, whichever occurred first. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using

Demographics
Sixty-three patients were registered on protocol. Six
patients were removed from the study because of a decline
in performance status (n ¼ 3) or brain metastases (n ¼ 1)
at initial screening, withdrawal of consent because of
adverse event concerns (n ¼ 1), or insurance/financial
issues (n ¼ 1).
Fifty-seven patients were treated. Their median age
was 57 years (range, 11-76 years). There were 30 women
and 27 men. Diagnoses were colorectal cancer (n ¼ 29),
melanoma (n ¼ 7), gastric cancer (n ¼ 4), hepatocellular
carcinoma (n ¼ 3), ovarian cancer (n ¼ 3), cholangiocarcinoma (n ¼ 3), and other (n ¼ 8). The median number
of prior therapies was 3 (range, 1-7 prior therapies). In the
subset of patients with colorectal cancer, the median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 1-8 prior therapies).
Thirty-three patients had received oxaliplatin previously
as salvage therapy. Prior therapies are listed in Table 1.
Dose Escalation and Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Table 2 summarizes the dose-escalation schedule and outcomes. No DLTs were reported at the first 5 dose levels of
HAI oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2 to 140 mg/m2).
Three patients were treated at the first 3 dose levels
of HAI oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2). Then, the

considered the MTD for this treatment regimen. Subsequently, 31 patients were treated at the MTD during the
expansion phase of the study, and none developed a DLT.

Toxicity Profile at the Recommended Dose
Overall, 37 patients (dose-escalation phase, 6 patients;
expansion phase, 31 patients) were treated at the MTD of
140 mg/m2 for a total of 139 cycles (median, 2 cycles;
range, 1-14 cycles). No serious treatment-related toxicities
were noted in any of these 37 patients.
Response
Fifty-five patients were evaluable for response. Of these
55 patients, 4 patients (7%; colorectal cancer, n ¼ 3;
breast cancer, n ¼ 1) achieved a partial response (PR) (tumor reduction of 45% at 17 months, 38% at 4 months,
31% at 9 months, and 30% at 3 months), and 32 patients
(58%) had stable disease (SD), including 15 patients
(48%) who had SD for 4 months. The remaining 19
patients (35%) had progressive disease. Responses are
shown as a waterfall plot analysis in Figure 1a.
The tumor types of the 32 patients with SD were as
follows: colorectal cancer, n ¼ 15; melanoma, n ¼ 5; hepatocellular cancer, n ¼ 3; ovarian cancer, n ¼ 3; cholangiocarcinoma, n ¼ 3; hemangiopericytoma, n ¼ 1; cancer
of the duodenum, n ¼ 1; and cancer of the gastroesophageal junction, n ¼ 1. The diagnoses of the 15 patients

who had SD for 4 months were as follows: colorectal
cancer, n ¼ 9; hepatocellular cancer, n ¼ 2; ovarian cancer, n ¼ 2; and cholangiocarcinoma, n ¼ 2.
Among 36 evaluable patients who were treated at
the MTD, 3 patients (9%) achieved a PR, and 20 patients
(57%) had SD. Of 28 patients with colorectal cancer who
were evaluable for response, 3 patients (11%) achieved a
PR, and 15 patients (54%) had SD, including 9 patients
(32%) who had SD for 4 months. All patients with
colorectal cancer who responded had received prior oxaliplatin. The 3 patients with colorectal cancer who achieved
a PR were treated previously as follows: One patient previously had received combined oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and
5-FU (FOLFOX) plus bevacizumab; combined irinotecan and cetuximab; and the deoxycitidine analogue TAS109. One patients previously had received FOLFOX plus
bevacizumab; combined irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-FU
(FOLFIRI); capecitabine; cetuximab; and combined
cetuximab, bevacizumab, and capecitabine. One patient
previously had received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab;
FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab; and combined 5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab. Figure 1b,c illustrates

with mixed cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma had SD and underwent resection of hepatic tumors
5.5 months after the initiation of HAI oxaliplatin in combination with systemic 5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab. She died 11 months after the surgery. The second
patient was an Asian boy aged 11 years with hepatitis Bassociated, multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma who had
failed on 4 previous therapies. Two months after the initiation of HAI oxaliplatin in combination with systemic
5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab, he had shrinkage of
his tumor by 23% compared with baseline and a significant tumor marker drop, and he underwent right and partial left hepatectomy. Eleven months later, his disease
progressed, and he was treated with valproic acid and
sunitinib, followed by gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. He
remains alive 17 months after the hepatectomy.
Survival and Failure-Free Survival
At a median follow-up of 14.7 months, 40 of 57 patients
had died. The median overall survival duration was 8.7
months (95% confidence interval, 5.4-11.6 months) (Fig.
2a). All deaths were because of progressive disease. Fortyfour patients had progressive disease. The median progression-free survival duration was 2.6 months (95% confidence interval, 1.7-6.7 months) (Fig. 2b).

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrated that the MTD of HAI oxaliplatin in combination with systemic 5-FU, leucovorin, and
bevacizumab was 140 mg/m2. The most common toxicities were thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea/vomiting,
constipation, and diarrhea. Four patients achieved a PR
(7%; colorectal carcinoma, n ¼ 3; breast cancer, n ¼ 1).
Stable disease for 4 months was noted in 15 patients
(colorectal cancer, n ¼ 9; hepatocellular cancer, n ¼ 2;
ovarian cancer, n ¼ 2; and cholangiocarcinoma, n ¼ 2).
Among the 28 patients who had colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver and were evaluable for response, 3
patients (11%) achieved a PR, and 15 patients (54%) had
SD, including 9 patients (32%) who maintained SD for
4 months.
The results of our study regarding the MTD are
consistent with those from another phase 1 study of HAI
with oxaliplatin in combination with folinic acid and 5FU in patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal
cancer.15 Although no bevacizumab was administered in
that study, oxaliplatin was given over a 4-hour period, and
the DLT of oxaliplatin was 150 mg/m2. Those investigaCancer

September 1, 2010

tors recommended the next lower dose level, ie, 125 mg/
m2, for phase 2 studies and reported a mean terminal halflife of administered ultrafiltrable platin of 18.8  9.3
hours.15
Our regimen was tolerated well, and 58% of patients
did not experience toxicity greater than grade 1. Oxaliplatin-associated neurosensory symptoms were noted, as
expected.22,23 However, oxaliplatin infusion-associated
abdominal pain was alleviated with prolongation of the
infusion and concomitant administration of corticosteroids. Similarly, although hepatotoxicity, including the
DLT of biliary sclerosis, was reported in earlier trials in
6% to 25% of patients who received FUDR,24 it was not
observed in our study, probably because we used premedication with corticosteroids to prevent oxaliplatin toxicity.
Keeping in mind that responders with colorectal
cancer who were enrolled in the current trial were heavily
pretreated, and all had previously received oxaliplatin, the
results noted in our study are encouraging. Higher rates of
response and survival have been reported by the CALGB,
but the baseline characteristics of patients between the 2
studies are not comparable, because only 3% of patients
in that study had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy.11
Although HAI chemotherapy regimens typically are used
to treat hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer and, thus,
the inclusion of any cancer type in the current study may
be viewed as a limiting factor, an intriguing finding was
that patients with other tumor types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, responded to this treatment with SD.
Other investigators have reported encouraging
results using HAI oxaliplatin-containing regimens for
colorectal liver metastases.16,17,25 In a phase 2 study, HAI
oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m2, iv leucovorin at 200 mg/m2,
and 5-FU at 400 mg/m2 as an iv bolus followed by 5-FU
600 mg/m2 as a 22-hour continuous infusion were
administered on Days 1 and 2 every 2 weeks. In 26 treated
patients, the intent-to-treat objective response rate was
64%, and the median overall and disease-free survival
both were 27 months.16 The same regimen produced an
overall response rate of 62% in patients with unresectable
liver metastases from colorectal cancer after systemic
chemotherapy failure.17 In another study, in patients with
colorectal liver metastases who underwent hepatectomy,
some liver metastases vanished on imaging studies and
remained undetected during hepatectomy, so that posthepatectomy oxaliplatin HAI was associated with favorable
outcomes (recurrence, survival, and disease-free
survival).26

Figure 2. (a) This Kaplan-Meier plot illustrates overall survival
for 57 patients with advanced solid tumors metastatic to the

tumors metastatic to the liver who received HAI of oxaliplatin
and systemic 5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab.

In prior years, HAI regimens used 5-fluoro-20 -deoxyuridine (FUDR)-containing regimens to treat patients
with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, because
FUDR has a very high first-pass extraction rate (range,
94%-99%) through the hepatic artery.6,27,28 In a phase 3
clinical trial, HAI with FUDR combination therapy was
associated with higher survival rates compared with similar systemic therapy alone at the time of resection.27
Ten phase 3 clinical trials have compared HAI
FUDR or 5-FU plus leucovorin with systemic FUDR or
5-FU plus leucovorin.11,28-37 In a randomized trial
(CALGB 9481), HAI therapy was associated with higher
rates of response (P ¼ .01) and survival (P ¼ .003) compared with systemic therapy.11 The HAI arms had superior response rates compared with the systemic arms

4092

(42%-62% vs 9%-21%), but a survival benefit was
observed in patients who were randomized to the HAI
arms in only 2 of those phase 3 trials.28
Other combination regimens with HAI chemotherapy also have produced promising results.38-40 A phase 2
study with HAI of 5-FU, iv oxaliplatin, and folinic acid in
patients with colorectal liver metastases was associated
with an overall response rate of 41%, a median time to
progression of 10 months, and a median overall survival
duration of 21 months.18
In a phase 1 study of either HAI and systemic oxaliplatin and irinotecan (Group A) or oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and
leucovorin (Group B), 36 patients (89% previously
treated) with unresectable liver metastases were treated.41
Systemic chemotherapy was administered every 2 weeks
concurrent with 2 weeks of HAI FUDR and dexamethasone every 28 days, and the overall response rate was
88%.41 In a retrospective analysis, HAI FUDR and dexamethasone plus iv irinotecan resulted in a 44% response
rate in patients with unresectable liver metastases from
colorectal cancer.42 In another phase 1 clinical trial with
HAI FUDR and dexamethasone plus systemic oxaliplatin
and irinotecan in patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer, the rate of conversion to resection in the 49 chemotherapy-naive and pretreated
patients was 47% (chemotherapy-naive patients, 57%).39
More recently, cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin
G1 monoclonal antibody that targets epidermal growth
factor receptor, has demonstrated promising activity in
combination with HAI chemotherapy.43
In conclusion, in the current study, the MTD of
HAI oxaliplatin was 140 mg/m2. HAI oxaliplatin combined with systemic 5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab
has antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid
tumors metastatic to the liver, and we believe this regimen
warrants further study.
