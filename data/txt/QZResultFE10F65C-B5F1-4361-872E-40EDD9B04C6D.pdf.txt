Abstract
The SWI/SNF multisubunit complex modulates chromatin
structure through the activity of two mutually exclusive catalytic subunits, SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, which both contain a
bromodomain and an ATPase domain. Using RNAi, cancerspeciﬁc vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in SWI/SNF-mutant
tumors, including SMARCA4-deﬁcient lung cancer; however,
the contribution of conserved, druggable protein domains to
this anticancer phenotype is unknown. Here, we functionally
deconstruct the SMARCA2/4 paralog dependence of cancer cells
using bioinformatics, genetic, and pharmacologic tools. We
evaluate a selective SMARCA2/4 bromodomain inhibitor
(PFI-3) and characterize its activity in chromatin-binding and
cell-functional assays focusing on cells with altered SWI/SNF
complex (e.g., lung, synovial sarcoma, leukemia, and rhabdoid
tumors). We demonstrate that PFI-3 is a potent, cell-permeable
probe capable of displacing ectopically expressed, GFP-tagged
SMARCA2-bromodomain from chromatin, yet contrary to

target knockdown, the inhibitor fails to display an antiproliferative phenotype. Mechanistically, the lack of pharmacologic
efﬁcacy is reconciled by the failure of bromodomain inhibition
to displace endogenous, full-length SMARCA2 from chromatin
as determined by in situ cell extraction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and target gene expression studies. Furthermore,
using inducible RNAi and cDNA complementation (bromodomain- and ATPase-dead constructs), we unequivocally identify
the ATPase domain, and not the bromodomain of SMARCA2,
as the relevant therapeutic target with the catalytic activity
suppressing deﬁned transcriptional programs. Taken together,
our complementary genetic and pharmacologic studies exemplify a general strategy for multidomain protein drug-target
validation and in case of SMARCA2/4 highlight the potential
for drugging the more challenging helicase/ATPase domain to
deliver on the promise of synthetic-lethality therapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction

ered recurrent somatic mutations and copy-number (CN) changes
in histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodeling complexes supporting a causal role for altered epigenetic states in
tumorigenesis (2–4). Although the mechanistic consequences
of these alterations remain poorly understood, it is appreciated
that such events promote acquisition of cell oncogenic capabilities through deregulation of nucleosome-dynamics, gene transcription, DNA replication, and repair (5). Indeed, chromatin
regulators are emerging as therapeutic targets and inhibitors of
histone-modifying enzymes, as well as bromodomains, which
"read" the histone marks, have recently shown efﬁcacy in preclinical and clinical settings through their ability to reverse
oncogenic transcriptional programs (6–8).
The Switch/Sucrose Non Fermentable (SWI/SNF) is a multisubunit chromatin remodeling complex that consists of one of
two mutually exclusive helicase/ATPase catalytic subunits,
SMARCA2 and SMARCA4. Together with core and regulatory
subunits, SMARCA2/4 couple ATP hydrolysis to the perturbation of histone-DNA contacts. This sculpting of the nucleosomal landscape at promoters provides access to transcription

Epigenetic dysregulation plays a fundamental role in the development of cancer (1). Large-scale genome sequencing has uncov-

factors and cognate DNA elements facilitating both gene activation and repression (9). Because various SWI/SNF subunits
are mutated or lost at high frequency in human tumors
(2–4, 10), this complex has garnered considerable attention
(11). A tumor-suppressive role has most strongly been demonstrated in childhood malignant rhabdoid tumors, in which
the SMARCB1 (Snf5) subunit is biallelicaly inactivated in
nearly all cases (10). Accordingly, knockout of mouse
SMARCB1 results in fully penetrant and lethal cancers with
11 weeks median onset (12). In human synovial carcinoma,
recurrent chromosomal translocations, which are diagnostic of
the malignancy, result in oncogenic fusions (SS18-SSX) that
alter the composition/function of the SWI/SNF complex (13).
Pointing to the broader relevance of SWI/SNF in cancers are
frequent inactivating mutations in accessory subunits, including ARID1A in ovarian and endometrial carcinomas (14, 15),
and PBRM1 in renal cell carcinomas (16).
Context-speciﬁc molecular vulnerabilities that arise during
tumor evolution represent an attractive class of drug targets;
however, the frequency and spectrum of somatic lesions often
confound efforts to identify such therapeutic targets solely based
on genomic information (17). To address this challenge, functional, unbiased chemical, and genetic loss-of-function (LOF)
platforms, which use either drug-like small-molecules or siRNA/
shRNA libraries, hold the promise to systematically identify
nonobvious target-genotype interactions that might impact clinical decisions (17–19). Recently, using genetic LOF approaches,
three groups have independently identiﬁed SMARCA2 as an
essential gene in SMARCA4-deﬁcient lung cancer (20–22) proposing a synthetic lethality therapeutic approach. However, it
remains unclear whether small-molecule inhibitors of the
SMARCA2 bromodomain or ATPase domain can mimic the
reported RNAi phenotypes resulting from paralog dependency
in SWI/SNF (11, 23).
Several subunits in the SWI/SNF complex contain bromodomains, which are evolutionary conserved protein–protein
interaction modules that bind acetyl-lysine on proteins and
histone tails (6, 24). Bromodomains are druggable and following the antitumor activity of JQ1 (6), there is interest in
broadly developing small-molecules inhibitors against other
family members to dissect their therapeutic potential (1, 6, 24,
25). Here, we speculate that SMARCA2/4 bromodomains could
contribute to either assembly or targeting of the SWI/SNF
complex to speciﬁc genomic loci providing an intervention
drug target rationale. However, because bromodomains are
frequently found in large protein complexes (and often ﬂanked
by additional domains involved in chromatin-binding and
protein–protein interactions), RNAi-mediated depletion alone
does not reveal the contribution of individual domains to the
LOF phenotype, representing a speciﬁc challenge for drug-target
validation.
In this report, we conduct complementary cDNA rescue and
pharmacologic studies to explore whether the bromodomain
of SMARCA2/4 represents a tractable target in SWI/SNFmutant cancers. We characterize the PFI-3 bromodomain
inhibitor in biochemical assays and across preclinical models
with altered SWI/SNF complex (lung, synovial sarcoma,
leukemia, and rhabdoid tumor cells) and discover that bromodomain function of SMARCA2/4 is dispensable for tumor
cell proliferation, while the catalytic ATPase activity is
essential.

Materials and Methods
Bioinformatics
Genome sequencing data and CN information were downloaded from cBioPortal (Supplementary Table S1). Cell line
genomic annotation was from the Sanger (www.cancerrxgene.
org) and the Broad Institutes (www.broadinstitute.org/ccle). Outlier sum statistics (26) and standard software packages for
sequence analysis were used.
Cell lines
Cells obtained from the ATCC were cultured accordingly:
RPMI-1640 (A549, H1299, H157, H520, H460, HeLa, and
THP-1); Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium (MV-4-11);
McCoy's 5a Modiﬁed Medium (A-204 and G-401) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). The Aska and Yamato cells (Osaka
Medical Center) were grown in DMEM (20% FBS). All Cell lines
were mycoplasma negative (LookOut Mycoplasma Kit PCR, Sigma) and maintained at low passage (<3 month) after thawing
from master vials (IACS and Pﬁzer BioBanks) subjected to short
tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling of polymorphic loci (Promega
PowerPlex 16 system) with a >80% match criteria for cell line
authentication.
Immunoblotting
Analysis was performed on whole-cell lysates (Supplementary
Information) using primary antibodies: SMARCA4 (Abcam,
#108318), SMARCA2 (Abcam, #15597), HA-Tag (Cell Signaling
Technology, #2367), a-Tubulin (Cell signaling Technology, 3873),
and secondary antibodies (Li-Cor, #926-68020, #926-32111).
Assays
PFI-3 (PF-06687252) is available from SGC (http://www.
thesgc.org/chemical-probes/PFI-3). Bromodomain selectivity
was measured using ligand binding, site-directed competitive
assays (BROMOscan, DiscoverRx; ref. 27). Cell potency was
measured using in situ cell extraction, CellTiter-Glo (Promega)
and clonogenic assays (Supplementary Information).
RNAi, plasmids, gene expression, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation
SMARCA2/4 shRNA (SIGMA TRC-collection) and siRNA
(ON-TARGET PLUS Dharmacon) sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2. ATPase-dead (K785A) and bromodomain mutations (Y1497F and N1540W) were made in human SMARCA4
cDNA (GeneCopoeia #GC-Y3533) using site-directed mutagenesis
(QuickChange, Agilent Technologies) with equivalent mutations
in SMARCA2 (GeneCopoeia #GC-Z4424). All cDNAs, subcloned
into lentiviral vectors, were sequence veriﬁed and virus generation, infection, and generation of stable cell lines were conducted
following standard procedures (Supplementary Information).
Gene expression (Affymetrix) data and methods have been deposited with NCBI (GSE69088). Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) and qPCR were conducted as previously described (28).

Targeting the SMARCA2/4 Bromodomain using RNAi and PFI-3

studies (Supplementary Table S1). Clearly, genomic alterations in
the 20 canonical SWI/SNF subunits are highly prevalent (Fig. 1A)
occurring in 15% of all cancers (3, 4, 10). Cancers with the highest
frequency of lesions in SWI/SNF subunits are rhabdoid tumors,
female cancers, including ovarian, uterine, cervical and endometrial, lung and gastric adenocarcinoma, melanoma, esophageal,
and renal clear cell carcinoma (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table
S1). A tumor-suppressive role of the SWI/SNF complex in these
contexts has been recognized based on the high frequency of
inactivating mutations, which is further underscored by mouse
genetic studies (10, 29). In contrast, SWI/SNF mutations do not
emerge as signiﬁcant recurrent alterations in glioblastoma, thyroid cancer, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). In AML, SMARCA4 may instead be an oncogene driving
cMYC transcription in concert with BRD4 (7, 11, 30, 31). As such,
it appears that cellular and tissue context deﬁnes the tumorsuppressive or oncogenic functions of the SWI/SNF complex
(5, 11, 23).
SMARCA4 deﬁciency is prevalent and mutually exclusive to
SMARCA2 CN loss in lung cancer
In primary human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), about half of
the SMARCA4 mutations are deleterious (nonsense and frameshift mutations) and occur at a 7% frequency in The Cancer
Genome Atlas patient samples (Fig. 1B). Overall, SWI/SNF complex components are mutated in 71 of 229 patients with an
average mutation rate of approximately 1.7 per sample. In addition, two copy loss of SMARCA4 is observed in 14 out of 299
LUAD cases adding to the fraction of SMARCA4-deﬁcient tumors.
Because heterozygous SMARCA4 knockout mice are haploinsufﬁcient and tumor prone (29), we also analyzed copy-number
driven mRNA expression and conclude that loss of one allele is
also sufﬁcient to decrease SMARCA4 expression (Fig. 1C). Focusing on LUAD and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), mapping of the genomic annotation onto individual patient samples
revealed that loss of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 is largely mutually
exclusive (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, with
respect to gene expression, outlier statistics identiﬁes SMARCA4,
along with ARID1A, as the most signiﬁcantly altered subunits in
the SWI/SNF complex in LUAD (Fig. 1E) with similar proﬁles
observed for LUSC (Supplementary Fig. S1B). At the genome
level, SMARCA4 ranks in the top 5% of all genes with negative
outlier sum statistics and its bimodal expression proﬁle (Fig. 1F)
clearly deﬁnes a SMARCA4-deﬁcient patient population.
In good concordance with cell line annotation at the Sanger
and the Broad Institutes, SMARCA4 protein expression was
nondetectable by Western blot analysis in approximately
20% (12/50) of lung cancer lines (Fig. 1G and Supplementary
Fig. S1C–S1E). Of eleven SMARCA4-mutant cell lines, only one
(NCI-H2286) displayed measurable protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1F). However, as previously noted, nondetectable SMARCA4 protein levels (as assessed by immunoblotting) occur more often than predicted from mutation and CN
analysis, suggesting that promoter methylation and epigenetic
silencing may be additional oncogenic mechanisms for
SMARCA4 loss (32). Paradoxically, a few cell lines appear to
have nondetectable expression of both SMARCA2 and
SMARCA4 (Fig. 1G). However, such complete dual-loss of
SMARCA2/4 is not observed in primary LUAD and LUSC
tumors as indicated by both our CN analysis (using both
GISTIC and ABSOLUTE algorithms; Supplementary Fig. S1G)

www.aacrjournals.org

and gene expression considerations. Although 3% (19/549) of
LUAD patients can be categorized as having low expression of
both SMARCA2 and SMARC4 (10th percentile; hypergeometric
distribution), the expression proﬁle for SMARCA2 lacks the
bimodal distribution characteristic for SMARCA4-null cancers
(Fig. 1F). Altogether, the above biomarker assessment (i.e.,
SMARCA4 loss) outlines a large, well-deﬁned patient population in need of novel molecularly targeted therapies.
Genotype-speciﬁc vulnerability and paralog dependency
examined in SMARCA4-reconstituted cells
The recent discovery that SMARCA2 knockdown inhibits the
growth of SMARCA4-deﬁcient cancer cells (20–22) has opened a
potential therapeutic avenue and received considerable attention
(11, 23, 33). However, it is unknown whether small-molecule
inhibitors against the ATPase or bromodomain can mimic the
RNAi phenotype. Hence, deﬁning the contribution of each domain
to the LOF phenotype is required for prioritizing drug discovery to
achieve tangible clinical therapeutic endpoints. To explore this, we
ﬁrst selected a representative panel of SMARCA4-deﬁcient and
proﬁcient lung cancer cells (Fig. 2A) and evaluated multiple
SMARCA2 shRNAs for knockdown efﬁciency (Fig. 2B) and phenotype. Using either viability (Fig. 2C) or long-term clonogenic
assays (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S2), we observed robust,
genotype-speciﬁc growth inhibition when SMARCA2 was depleted
in SMARCA4-deﬁcient cell lines (A549, H1299, and H157). In
contrast, knockdown in SMARCA4-proﬁcient cells (H460, H520,
and HeLa) had no effect on viability conﬁrming the reported
synthetic-lethal SMARCA2/4 interaction (20–22).
Next, we engineered SMARCA4-deﬁcient A549 cells to reexpress a doxycycline-inducible wild-type SMARCA4 cDNA (Fig.
2E). Control cells treated with SMARCA2 siRNAs did not grow,
whereas the expression of SMARCA4 (þDox) completely restored
growth (Fig. 2F and G). Most strikingly, SMARCA4 expression
increased 5-fold following SMARCA2 depletion (Fig. 2F) indicative of compensation, a ﬁnding that supports the reciprocal
assembly and stability of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 into the
SWI/SNF complex (22).
PFI-3 is a selective, potent, and cell-permeable SMARCA2/4
bromodomain inhibitor
To explore pharmacologic inhibition of the SMARCA2 bromodomain, we next evaluated the small-molecule inhibitor PFI-3
(Fig. 3A) discovered through a collaboration between the Structural Genomic Consortium and Pﬁzer. Biochemically, we determined that PFI-3 binds avidly to both SMARCA2 and SMARCA4
bromodomains (BROMOScan Kd's between 55 nmol/L and 110
nmol/L) consistent with the binding constant (Kd ¼ 89 nmol/L)
measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (www.thesgc.org/
chemical-probes/PFI-3). Moreover, using recombinant puriﬁed
bromodomains, we discovered that PFI-3 binds with similar
avidity to both the short and long isoform of SMARCA2 revealing
that the alternatively-spliced 18 amino acid insert (34) does not
impair PFI-3 binding (Fig. 3A). Moreover, proﬁling against 32
bromodomains at DiscoveRx (27) conﬁrmed exquisite selectivity
versus other subfamilies (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S3)
expanding the PFI-3 selectivity information obtained using differential scanning ﬂuorimetry (DSF). In summary, we ﬁnd that
there is a good concordance between the ligand competition
(BROMOScan) and the direct biophysical binding (DSF) assays

and note that in addition to targeting SMARCA2/4, PFI-3 also has
activity (70% inhibition at 2 mmol/L) against the structurally
related ﬁfth bromodomain from PBRM1, another SWI/SNF
subunit.
In cell-based chromatin-binding assays, using in situ cell extraction techniques to remove non-chromatin bound proteins, we
observed dose-dependent displacement of GFP-tagged SMARCA2
bromodomain (i.e., 132 amino acid residues) by PFI-3 (Fig. 3D
and E). Notably, the inhibitor showed prolonged cell-target
engagement with similar potency (IC50 ¼ 5.78 mmol/L) following 2 and 24 hours treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). As a
negative control, JQ1 did not inhibit the binding of ectopically
expressed SMARCA2 bromodomain, but selectively displaced
GFP-tagged BRD4 (Fig. 3D, and data not shown). Taken
together, our cell-biochemical data cooperate the accelerated
ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) reported
for PFI-3 (35), and we conclude that PFI-3 is a selective,
cell-permeable probe suitable to study the inhibition of
SMARCA2/4 bromodomains in cells.
PFI-3 does not phenocopy the growth-inhibitory effects of
SMARCA2 knockdown in lung cancer
Armed with PFI-3 and motivated by the context-speciﬁc phenotype of SMARCA2 depletion (Fig. 2), we evaluated PFI-3 in the
SMARCA4-deﬁcient responder lines (A549, H1299, H157), but
observed no antiproliferative effects in either 3-day cell viability

(Fig. 4A) or long-term clonogenic assays (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Because SWI/SNF is a multisubunit complex
containing numerous chromatin-interacting domains, we speculated that selective SMARCA2 bromodomain inhibition by itself
is not sufﬁcient to dislodge the endogenous SWI/SNF complex
from chromatin. To elaborate on this, the binding of endogenous
(full-length) SMARCA2 to chromatin was monitored by immunoﬂuorescence in A549 cells using SMARCA2 knockdown as a
speciﬁcity control (Fig. 4C–E). Even high concentrations of PFI-3
(30 mmol/L; 1 and 24 hours) were unable to displace the
SMARCA2 protein from chromatin (Fig. 4C and D). Again, we
cross-validated the in situ cell extraction assay using the reference
JQ1 inhibitor, which potently inhibited chromatin-binding of
endogenous BRD4 (Fig. 4C, bottom) but not SMARCA2 (data not
shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the bromodomain of SMARCA2 is dispensable for chromatin binding and
SWI/SNF oncogenic activity in lung cancer.
PFI-3 treatment of synovial sarcoma cells and target gene
promoter occupancy studies
As alterations in SWI/SNF have been implicated in disease
progression of synovial sarcomas (13), we also evaluated the
pharmacologic activity of PFI-3 in Yamato and Aska cells. These
cells harbor the hallmark recurrent chromosomal translocation
t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which fuses the SS18 gene, an integral
subunit of SWI/SNF complex, to one of the three SSX genes (SSX1,

SSX2, and SSX4), observed in >95% of patients (36). Incorporation of the SS18-SSX fusion protein into the SWI/SNF complex
results in eviction and degradation of the tumor-suppressor
SMARCB1. The altered SWI/SNF complex binds to the SOX2
locus, resulting in aberrant SOX2 expression, which is essential
for proliferation of synovial sarcomas (13). Accordingly, Yamato
and Aska cells show high levels of Sox2 expression (37). Hence, we
hypothesized that PFI-3 may inhibit the altered SWI/SNF complex
and impair cell growth, but we did not observe inhibition of cell
proliferation in either 4-day viability (Fig. 5A) or long-term
proliferation assays (Fig. 5B). We then assessed SOX2 expression
and found that PFI-3 treatment (day 3 and day 6) failed to reduce
SOX2 transcript levels at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S5).
To elaborate on the lack of inhibitor-induced phenotype, we
examined SWI/SNF binding at the transcriptionally active SOX2
promoter. SMARCA4 ChIP demonstrated high SWI/SNF complex
occupancy at the SOX2 promoter in Yamato cells, as previously
reported (13), while no enrichment was observed at the MYOD1
locus, a transcriptionally silent locus as conﬁrmed by RNA Polymerase II ChIP (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Importantly, we also examined whether PFI-3 treatment could impair

PFI-3 treatment of SMARCA4-dependent rhabdoid cancer or
leukemia cells
Rhabdoid tumors are distinctly characterized by biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF complex
(10), and genetic studies have demonstrated that oncogenesis
mediated by SMARCB1 loss is dependent on the residual activity
of SMARCA4-containing SWI/SNF complex (38). To establish a
benchmark for PFI-3 treatment of A-204 and G-401 rhabdoid
tumor cells, we identiﬁed two shRNAs that produced effective
(>80%) SMARCA4 protein knockdown (Fig. 5E) and conﬁrmed
inhibition of cell viability in both short-term proliferation and
long-term clonogenic assays (Fig. 5F and G). In contrast with the
RNAi phenotype, pharmacologic bromodomain inhibition did
not impact the growth of rhabdoid cancer cells (Fig. 5H).

only a minor change in SOX2 promoter occupancy, suggesting
inefﬁcient inhibition of SWI/SNF binding (Fig. 5D). These data
are consistent with the in situ cell extraction results for PFI-3

Finally, we extended our phenotypic evaluation of PFI-3 to
leukemia as previous RNAi studies have shown that AML cells
depend on SMARCA4 to support oncogenic transcriptional programs (30, 31). Similar to our ﬁndings across lung, synovial
sarcomas, and rhabdoid tumor cell lines, PFI-3 treatment did not
afford an anticancer phenotype in THP-1 and MV4-11 leukemic
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6) highlighting the critical importance
of pharmacologic drug target validation as a follow-up to RNAimediated knockdown studies.

to in situ cell extraction and discovered that the SMARCA2 mutants
bound chromatin similarly to that of WT (Fig. 7A and B). Hence,
failure of the ATP-Dead construct to rescue is due to lack of
catalytic activity and not due to gross impairment in chromatin
binding. Altogether, our genetic assessment clearly demonstrates
that SMARCA4-deﬁcient cancer cells do not require a functional
SMARCA2/4 bromodomain for growth. Instead, we unequivocally identify the catalytic activity of the ATPase domain as the
appropriate, albeit more challenging, small-molecule drug target.

Synthetic lethality of SMARCA2 knockdown is linked to the
catalytic ATPase activity
To genetically validate the PFI-3 results, we next used a 30 UTR
targeting shRNA (shS2) to knockdown endogenous SMARCA2
in H1299 cells engineered to express either wild-type (WT),
ATP-binding pocket deﬁcient (K755A; ref. 20) or bromodomain
mutant (N1482W; ref. 39) forms of SMARCA2 (Fig. 6A). Ectopic
expression of either SMARCA2 WT or the bromodomain bindingdeﬁcient mutant (BRD-Mut), but not the ATPase-dead form
(ATP-Dead), completely rescued the RNAi-mediated LOF phenotype (Fig. 6B and C). Likewise, A549 cells reconstituted with
SMARCA4 WT or BRD-Mut (N1540W, Y1497F), but not ATPDead (K785A), were able to grow upon SMARCA2 knockdown
(Fig. 6D–F). We also subjected the isogenic matched-pair cell lines

Genome-wide microarray analysis of SMARCA2/4 rescue
experiments
To examine the dependency on ATPase activity, we generated
microarray expression data (GSE69088) for the above cDNA
rescue experiments. Unsupervised clustering of the top variable
genes revealed three distinct expression proﬁles that were robust
to the gene set size while clustering (Fig. 7C and D). In the absence
of SMARCA2 knockdown (shLuc), all H1299 derivative lines
clustered together (Group 1) irrespective of the nature of the
ectopically expressed SMARCA2 constructs. On the other hand,
the SMARCA2 knockdown cells (shSMARCA2) showed strong
differential gene expression deﬁning two distinct clusters: cells
rescued with either WT or BRD-Mut (Group 2) versus cells
expressing either vector control (Ctrl) or ATP-Dead (Group 3).

Notably, expression/rescue using either SMARCA2 or SMARCA4
showed identical clustering behavior, and differences in mRNA
levels within the three groups were nonsigniﬁcant. Hence, the
transcriptional proﬁles reinforce the view that BRD-Mut is able to
perform similar functions to the WT gene while ATP-Dead, despite
retaining its ability to bind chromatin (Fig. 7A and B), cannot.
Consistent with the phenotypic responses (Fig. 6), gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed upregulation of apoptosis
and death pathways in Group 3 versus the rescued cell lines
(Group 2) highlighting the observed context-speciﬁc synthetic
lethality (Supplementary Fig. S8).

whether similar gene expression programs may account for the
observed functional complementation. To establish a framework for this analysis, we ﬁrst derived gene expression signatures for SMARCA4 expression in A549 cells (in the context of
SMARCA2 knockdown) comprising the top-100 upregulated
and downregulated genes, respectively (Supplementary Table
S4). Using GSEA, we then looked for enrichment of these
signatures with gene lists from SMARCA2 rescue experiments
as queries (Fig. 7E and F and Supplementary Table S5). When
comparing ATP-Dead to WT, the enrichment proﬁles suggest
that the ATPase enzymatic activity preferentially reverses
expression of genes that are upregulated upon RNAi-mediated
(synthetic lethal) knockdown of SMARCA2 (Fig. 7E). Genes
downregulated upon SMARCA2 knockdown were not fully
reversed by the rescue (Fig. 7F and Supplementary Table S5).
Therefore, our microarray data clearly show that the ATPase

Targeting the SMARCA2/4 Bromodomain using RNAi and PFI-3

domain of SMARCA2/4 complements each other at the transcriptional level exerting similar suppressive function on speciﬁc gene expression programs.
Next, using GSEA, we identiﬁed biologic pathways/states
shared by both rescue experiments leveraging annotated pathways from the Molecular Signature Database (mSigDB; The
Broad Institute). GSEA identiﬁed enrichment of cell proliferation (cell cycle, cyclin D1, G2–M checkpoint), chromatin remodeling (mitotic spindle, DNA replication and synthesis), and
tumorigeneis (EMT, integrin, KRAS and P53 pathway signatures). These gene expression programs, which are enriched
in rescued cells compared with cells lacking ATPase activity
common to SMARCA2/4, have bonaﬁde tumorigenic functions
(Fig. 7G).
In conclusion, the SMARCA4 cDNA complementation (i.e., reexpression) and the SMARCA2 RNAi rescue experiments are
consistent with the observed lack of pharmacologic activity of
PFI-3 in SWI/SNF-mutant cancers, and we demonstrate for the
ﬁrst time that selective SMARCA2/4 bromodomain inhibition is
not a feasible therapeutic strategy for targeting aberrant SWI/SNF
activity in SWI/SNF-mutant cancers. Instead, drug discovery
efforts should be focused on inhibiting the ATPase catalytic
activity to deliver on the promise of robust, cancer-speciﬁc synthetic lethal therapy.

Discussion
A common theme has emerged from genetic studies where
imbalances between various paralogous subunits within SWI/
SNF (e.g., SMARCA2/4 and ARID1A/B) can render cells more
tumorigenic and simultaneously hypersensitive to targeting of the
residual complex (13, 20–23, 40, 41). However, despite the high
prevalence of genomic lesions in SWI/SNF, studies have not
addressed how this observation can be translated into effective,
drug discovery endpoints.
In this study, we ﬁrst demonstrated context-speciﬁc antiproliferative phenotype of SMARCA2 depletion in SMARCA4-deﬁcient
lung cancer using multiple, non-overlapping hairpins, as well as
independent siRNAs, validating the synthetic–lethal relationship
between SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 (20–22). We further showed
that expression of either SMARCA2 or SMARCA4 completely
rescued the effects of SMARCA2 knockdown in SMARCA4-deﬁcient cells, indicating paralog dependence and reciprocal role of
these two subunits in tumorigenesis. The functional complementation of SMARCA2/4 was also evident at the transcriptional level
where the ATPase activity appears to control gene programs
related to proliferation, cell cycle, and chromatin remodeling.
Furthermore, genomic analysis revealed mutual exclusivity of
SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 mutations in LUSC and LUAD carcinoma and expression-based biomarker analysis outlined a

SMARCA4-deﬁcient patient population predicted to depend
exclusively on SMARCA2 activity (Fig. 1). Because SMARCA2deﬁcient mice are viable showing no overt phenotype (42), while
SMARCA4 inactivation is embryonic lethal (43), one might
anticipate a signiﬁcant therapeutic window, if selective smallmolecule SMARCA2 inhibitors can be developed that mimic the
RNAi knockdown phenotype.
SMARCA2 contains an ATPase and bromodomain, suggesting
at least two tractable avenues for inhibitor development. Targeting the acetyl-lysine recognition function of SWI/SNF bromodomains (e.g., the SMARCA2/4, PBRM1, BRD7, and BRD9 subunits)
represents an unexplored opportunity for perturbation of the
SWI/SNF complex. Recently, the anticancer activity of BET bromodomains inhibitors has fueled the development of novel
chemical scaffolds that selectively target other bromodomains
(6, 24, 25), and the PFI-3 inhibitor exempliﬁes one such novel
chemical probe. However, despite being broadly available from
SGC, no phenotypic data have yet been reported. Hence, we
subjected PFI-3 to rigorous biochemical and cellular characterization conﬁrming its exquisite selectivity, potency and cell permeability (Fig. 3). Such pharmacodynamics studies are a critical
component of drug target validation studies as they provided
conﬁdence that a compound-induced phenotype (or lack thereof)
correlate with biochemical target engagement in cells.
Surprisingly, in contrast with SMARCA2 knockdown, PFI-3 did
not display any antiproliferative phenotype in SMARCA4-deﬁcient lung cell lines across a variety of biologic assays. Likewise, in
models harboring deﬁned SWI/SNF alterations, including synovial sarcoma (SSX-fusion), rhabdoid tumors (SMARCB1-null),
and leukemia (SMARCA4-dependent), PFI-3 did not mimic the
anticancer phenotype observed upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of SMARCA2/4 (31, 38, 44). Mechanistically, and consistent with the lack of cellular phenotype, we discovered that PFI-3
cannot displace endogenous SMARCA2 (i.e., lung) or SMARCA4
(i.e., synovial sarcoma) from chromatin potentially due to the
activity of other chromatin-interacting SWI/SNF subunits
highlighting challenges in targeting large protein complexes. This
result is in sharp contrast with efﬁcient chromatin displacement of
endogenous BRD4 by JQ1 (Fig. 4C), and we note the contrasting
feature of the BET family of tandem bromodomains, which are
not ﬂanked by other known regulatory or conserved domains.
Recent studies have highlighted the role of residual SWI/SNF
complex along with paralog dependence, indicating a potential
combinatorial role of chromatin-interacting domains in SWI/SNF
recruitment (5). Our data further highlight the need to conduct
similar target identiﬁcation/validation studies of other paralog
subunits like ARID1A and ARID1B that form mutually exclusive
SWI/SNF complexes and display a synthetic lethal relationship
(40). Additional vulnerabilities like antagonism between
SMARCB1 and EZH2, which renders rhabdoid tumors dependent

on EZH2 for disease maintenance (45), present another promising approach to target SWI/SNF-mutant cancers. The antiproliferative response to SMARCA4 knockdown and EZH2 inhibitor
treatment highlights clear dependencies on SWI/SNF activity (Fig.
5E–Hand Supplementary Fig. S7A). However, it remains to be
investigated whether other SWI/SNF-mutant cancers are sensitive
to EZH2 inhibition since we did not see activity of the EZH2
inhibitor in SMARCA4-deﬁcient lung cancer cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7B).
For SWI/SNF-mutant cancers, our target validation approach
has focused on dissecting the functional contribution of an
impaired SMARCA2/4 bromodomain or ATPase domain to
cellular phenotype through parallel cDNA complementation
and rescue experiments. The observation that expression of
BRD-Mut, but not ATP-Dead, can rescue the SMARCA2 knockdown phenotype is consistent with the pharmacologic PFI-3
inhibitor data. Thus, our genetic and chemical ﬁndings converge and we unequivocally conclude that small-molecule
inhibition of the bromodomain is dispensable for the ability
of the SWI/SNF complex in controlling tumor growth. As such,
the present study is the ﬁrst to deprioritize SMARCA2/4 bromodomain inhibition as a tractable target in genetically deﬁned
lung, synovial sarcoma, leukemia, and rhabdoid tumors. However, we cannot exclude that compounds with a selectivity
proﬁle that simultaneously inhibits additional bromodomains
in SWI/SNF (e.g., PBRM1, BRD7, and BRD9 subunits) could be
an efﬁcacious strategy (although pleiotropic bromodomain
inhibition in normal cells could be a potential concern).
Although the importance of ATPase activity has previously
been shown for chromatin remodeling (20), our studies pinpoint the ATPase activity as the molecular synthetic-lethal
target providing a genetically validated strategy for targeting
SWI/SNF-mutant lung cancer.
ATPases represents a large and diverse family of proteins, many
of which perform chaperone-like functions assisting in the assembly, operation, and disassembly of protein complexes (46). Not
surprisingly, because numerous cellular processes are driven by
energy-dependent conformational changes in multisubunit complexes, ATPases have been implicated in various human diseases
with several inhibitors in clinical use. However, most of these do
not directly engage/bind the nucleotide-binding site (47). Developing potent inhibitors that must compete with intracellular
concentrations of ATP (2–10 mmol/L) have been challenging.
Phosphate groups contribute signiﬁcant nucleotide-binding afﬁnity, but to overcome poor cell-permeability of negatively-charged
phosphate groups, the majority of synthetic ATP analogues are
devoid of highly charged phospho-mimetic groups (47). Moreover, the high sequence homology between ATP-binding sites
(among ATPases and other ATP-binding proteins) represents a
profound selectivity challenge. Overall, there is a need for the
development of novel, potent, and bioavailable ATPase inhibitors, and the successful design of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, yet another class of ATP-binding enzymes, supports at least in
principal, the feasibility of targeting the ATP-binding site of
SMARCA2.
SMARCA2 belongs to the SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling ATPases and contains most of the conserved motifs
found in SF2 helicases (48). However, SMARCA2/4 share little
overall sequence homology with other helicases and even less
homology with other ATPases (46, 48). Moreover, the sequence
homology of the SMARCA2 ATPase is limited to only two SNF2

3876 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

clusters in the human genome— related SMARCA proteins and
a class of DNA helicases, suggesting possibility for achieving
exquisite selectivity over other ATPases. An obvious challenge
would be to obtain selectivity over SMARCA4 as these enzymes
are highly homogenous in their active site and dual inhibition
in normal cells could limit the therapeutic window (29).
Structural insights often guide the design of selective inhibitors;
however, very few X-ray crystal structures for ATPase domains
are currently available for SMARCA2/4-related proteins with
most being in open inactive conformation, like the yeast Chd1
ATPase domain, highlighting the need for furthering structural
biology. Another barrier for pharmaceutical development of
selective ATPase inhibitors is the current lack of commercial
high-throughput screening assays and selectivity panels against
the large family of ATP-binding proteins. Nevertheless, structural diversity in the vicinity of the nucleotide-binding sites,
including possible allosteric sites, should enable SMARCA2
ATPase drug discovery supported by prior identiﬁcation of
potent and selective inhibitors of the ATPase activity of KIF11,
Hsp90, and VCP (49, 50). The recent development of selective
and cell-potent covalent inhibitors that block ATP binding, as
well as allosteric inhibitors that impair nucleotide turnover for
the VCP ATPase (50), is also an encouraging avenue for the
development of inhibitors targeting the SMARCA2 ATPase
catalytic activity.
Taken together, our target validation studies identify the
SMARCA2 ATPase domain, but not the bromodomain, as a
tractable, albeit more challenging therapeutic target for a welldeﬁned SMARCA4-deﬁcient patient population representing
more than 20,000 patients a year in the United States alone
(i.e., 10%–20% of NSCLC cases). Moreover, the SMARCA4deﬁcient patient population generally lacks targetable oncogenes
(such as mutant EGFR or ALK translocations; ref. 20), which
further emphasize the potential medical impact of developing
inhibitors of the ATPase domain of SMARCA2/4.
