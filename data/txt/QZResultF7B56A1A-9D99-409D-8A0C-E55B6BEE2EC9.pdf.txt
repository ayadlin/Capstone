ABSTRACT
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are safe and effective delivery vehicles for small
interfering RNA (siRNA), as a result of their excellent biocompatibility. In this work,
mPEG-PE (polyethylene glycol-L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine) was synthesized and
used to prepare nanoparticles composed of mPEG-PE and calcium phosphate for siRNA
delivery. Calcium phosphate and mPEG-PE formed the stable hybrid nanoparticles
through self-assembly resulting from electrostatic interaction in water. The average
size of the hybrid nanoparticles was approximately 53.2 nm with a negative charge
of approximately −16.7 mV, which was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
measurements. The nanoparticles exhibited excellent stability in serum and could
protect siRNA from ribonuclease (RNase) degradation. The cellular internalization of
siRNA-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated in SMMC-7721 cells using a laser scanning
confocal microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry. The hybrid nanoparticles could
efficiently deliver siRNA to cells compared with free siRNA. Moreover, the in vivo
distribution of Cy5-siRNA-loaded hybrid nanoparticles was observed after being injected
into tumor-bearing nude mice. The nanoparticles concentrated in the tumor regions
through an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect based on the fluorescence
intensities of tissue distribution. A safety evaluation of the nanoparticles was performed
both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that the hybrid nanoparticle delivery system had
almost no toxicity. These results indicated that the mPEG-PE/CaP hybrid nanoparticles
could be a stable, safe and promising siRNA nanocarrier for anticancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

cells resulting in silenced genes because of ribonuclease
(RNase) degradation, inefficient cellular uptake and rapid
clearance from systemic circulation upon intravenous
injection [6–8]. Therefore, the development a safe and
efficient delivery system for siRNA remains the main
challenge for the clinical success of RNA interference
(RNAi) therapy. A large number of non-viral vectors
have been developed to pack siRNA molecules into
nanoparticles, including cationic lipids, [9, 10] polymers
[11, 12] and inorganic nanoparticles [13–15].

Due to the ability of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) to effectively silence specific genes, siRNA
has quickly emerged as one of the most promising drugs
for the treatment of various human diseases, such as
viral infections, genetic diseases and cancer [1–4]. This
treatment method is based on living cells introducing
exogenous genes, which encode therapeutic proteins
that can correct and eradicate diseases at the sources
[5]. However, naked siRNA is rarely delivered to target

Calcium phosphate (CaP) is the main mineral
found in human bone and teeth and is considered as a
highly biocompatible inorganic biomaterial [16–18]. CaP
precipitates are able to effectively encapsulate negatively
charged nucleic acids and are a suitable candidate for
use as an siRNA carriers [19, 20]. Moreover, amorphous
CaP is sparingly soluble in water and can be rapidly
synthesized by mixing aqueous solutions of calcium
and phosphate ions [21–23]. CaP rapidly dissipates in
acidic pH conditions, and CaP endocytosed by cells is
degraded in the endosomes and releases siRNA into the
cytoplasm [24, 25]. However, uncoated CaP colloids are
very unstable and tend to aggregate to form large particles.
The cellular uptake of large CaP particles is limited and
the large agglomerates cannot be used for therapeutic
applications in vivo [26–28]. Thus, the preparation of
stable CaP nanoparticles is critical for the delivery of
siRNA to target tissues in vivo.
Many researchers have attempted to prepare stable
CaP colloids for systemic siRNA delivery. Recently,
Li et al. developed CaP nanoparticles with lipid coatings
for siRNA delivery where the outer lipid stabilied the
CaP core [29]. Xie et al. reported the development of
PEGylated carboxymethyl chitosan and CaP anionic
nanoparticles to deliver siRNA [30]. In addition, Lee
et al. prepared dopa-hyaluronic acid conjugate CaP
nanoparticles for target-specific delivery of siRNA [31].
Therefore, PEGylated CaP can used to generate safe
and stable hybrid nanoparticles for efficient siRNA
transfection in vivo.
Phospholipids are a major component of cell
membranes and are widely used to prepare drug carriers.
Anionic phospholipids are negatively charged and can
complex with CaP through electrostatic interactions [32–34].
In this work, anionic L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine was
utilized as a hydrophobic moiety and mPEG was used
to hydrophilic moiety to formed anionic mPEG-PE
block copolymers. mPEG-PE block copolymers can
self-assemble into anionic micelles in water, which are
able to form hybrid nanoparticles with cationic CaP and
control CaP growth (denoted as NPmPEG-PE/CaP). CaP can
condense siRNA into the hybrid nanoparticles and mPEG
is able to prolong the circulation time of nanoparticles
(denoted as NP/siRNA). NPmPEG-PE/CaP can deliver siRNA
into cancer cells and target tissues through EPR effects.
Moreover, the safety of NPmPEG-PE/CaP has been evaluated
in vivo. Due to the non-cytotoxic nature of both CaP and
mPEG-PE, there is great value in developing NPmPEG-PE/CaP
as an siRNA delivery system.

and the EDC/NHS was used as a coupling agent to reduce
reaction times. The residual PE and EDC/NHS was
removed with anhydrous diethyl ether. The structure of
mPEG-PE was confirmed by FT-IR spectra and 1H NMR
spectra. The 1H NMR spectra of mPEG-PE is shown
in Figure 1D. The proton peak of PE (−CH3 at δ 0.9,
−CH2− at δ 1.3, −CH = CH− at δ 5.34) (Figure 1C) were
observed in the spectra of mPEG-PE. The existence
of methoxy group (CH3O− at δ 3.4) and the PEG
segment (−CH2CH2O− at δ 3.7) (Figure 1B) peaks from
mPEG-COOH demonstrated successful conjugation.
FT-IR analysis demonstrated that the C = O groups
appeared at 1738 cm−1 in the IR of PE and mPEG-PE
(Figure 2). The characteristic peaks of CO-NH and C-O-C
were present at approximately 1570 cm−1 and 1110 cm−1,
respectively. These results further indicated the successful
synthesis of mPEG-PE.

Preparation and characterization of NPmPEG-PE/CaP
The mPEG-PE micelles were generated using a
thin film hydration method with the amphiphilic block
copolymer. The anionic micelles were formed through
the self-assembly of a thin film of the mPEG-PE in an
aqueous buffer solution (Figure 3A). The hydrophobic PE
segments formed the dense inner core of micelles, while
the hydrophilic mPEG segments formed the outer shell.
This preparation method was simple and repeatable.
To package siRNA into the anionic mPEG-PE
micelles, calcium ions were used as electrostatic bridges
between siRNA and the mPEG-PE micelles. The hybrid
nanoparticles were prepared by mixing a solution of
phosphate ions with a solution containing mPEG-PE,
siRNA and calcium ions (Figure 3A). The calcium
ions, phosphate ions and siRNA self-assembled into the
micelles to form the PEG-coated CaP nanoparticles.
The FT-IR spectra of NPmPEG-PE/CaP are shown in
Figure 2. Peaks at 1055 cm−1 are attributed to −PO4
in amorphous CaP that was prepared in the absence
of mPEG-PE (Figure 2C). Figure 2D shows the FTIR
the peaks of C-O-C, C = O and −CH2 at approximately
1160 cm−1, 1738 cm−1 and 2960 cm−1, respectively.
Moreover, peaks at 1070 cm−1 were observed in the FTIR
spectra of NPmPEG-PE/CaP, which originated from −PO4. These
results demonstrated that the mPEG-PE and CaP hybrid
nanoparticles were successfully prepared.
The morphology of the nanoparticles was observed
by TEM, which showed that the nanoparticles were
spherical and had no obvious aggregation (Figure 3B). The
particle sizes of NP/siRNA were characterized by DLS. As
shown in Figure 3D, the average size was approximately
53.2 ± 1.8 nm and the polydispersity index was 0.124, both
of which were beneficial for the passive tumor targeting of
drug delivery through the EPR effect. The nanoparticles
in aqueous solution were negatively charged with a zeta
potential of −16.7 ± 0.8 mV (Figure 3E).

RESULTS
Synthesis and characterization of mPEG-PE
The synthetic route to prepare mPEG-PE is
illustrated in Figure 1A. The amine groups of PE was

The XRD patterns of NP/siRNA confirmed
the absence of distinct of crystalline CaP peaks. As
shown in Figure 3C, a peak characteristic peak of an
amorphous phase was observed at 2θ = 30°, indicating
that the nanoparticles consisted of the amorphous calcium
phosphate [37].

studied in 50% FBS at 37°C with a gel retardation assay.
It was found that NPmPEG-PE/CaP could protect siRNA
from RNase degradation in serum for 24 h (Figure 4C).
However, the naked siRNA was quickly degraded after
6 h of incubation. These results clearly demonstrate that
NPmPEG-PE/CaP is suitable for the systemic delivery of siRNA.
Effective encapsulation of siRNA in the
nanoparticles was confirmed by a centrifugal assay,
which indicated that about 80% of siRNA were loaded
in the hybrid nanoparticles. Due to the CaP condensing
nucleic acids, the hybrid nanoparticles had very high
encapsulation efficiencies.

Colloidal stability study of NP/siRNA
Particle aggregation negatively affects the longer
circulation times of intravenously administered particles.
The stability of the generated nanoparticles was evaluated
by measuring the mean diameter of the particles. As shown
in Figure 4A, the size of the nanoparticles ranged from
53 nm to 168 nm after being stored for seven days at 4°C.
Moreover, the colloidal stability of nanoparticles in FBS
was investigated. The size of the hybrid nanoparticles was
monitored in a solution containing 50% FBS at 37°C. The
size hardly any increased in FBS, as demonstrated after
incubation for 24 h (Figure 4B). However, the size of the
nanoparticles increased to 205 nm after 96 h. These results
suggested that the surface PEG corona of the nanoparticles
effectively prevented particle aggregation and enhanced
their colloidal stability.
To evaluate the serum stability of the hybrid
nanoparticles loaded with siRNA when circulating in
blood, the degradation of siRNA and NP/siRNA were

Cellular uptake of NP/Cy3-siRNA
The internalization and intracellular distribution
of the hybrid nanoparticles in SMMC-7721 cells were
observed with confocal microscopy. Cy3-labelled siRNA
was used as a fluorescent probe, and the cell nuclei were
stained with Hocehst 33342. As shown in Figure 5A,
CaP precipitated and formed large aggregates, which
reduced their transfection efficiencies. Cy3-siRNA- and
Cy3-siRNA-loaded CaP and NPmPEG-PE/CaP were observed
by CLSM after incubation with cells for 4 h. Based
on flow cytometry data, the intracellular fluorescence
intensity of FAM-siRNA uptake by SMMC-7721 cells for
different periods of time were observed in the following

of red blood cells but the negative control was transparent
and the red blood cells were deposited at the bottom of
the tube (Figure 7A). The colors of the NPmPEG-PE/CaP
samples at different concentrations were between the
negative control and positive control and exhibited much
lower haemolytic effects.

In vivo biodistribution study

The cytotoxicity of NPmPEG-PE/CaP was evaluated
in SMMC-7721 cells via an MTT assay. As shown in
Figure 7C, no significant cytotoxicity was observed for
the cells treated with NPs when the final concentration of
NPmPEG-PE/CaP was 2000 µg/mL or less.

To observe the biodistribution of mPEG-PE/siRNA/
CaP nanoparticles in SMMC-7721 tumor-bearing mice,
Cy5-siRNA loaded in NPs and free Cy5-siRNA were
injected into the mice at doses of 1.2 mg/kg. The in situ
fluorescence distributions were monitored by fluorescence
imaging at 4 h and 24 h. As shown in Figure 6A, free
Cy5-siRNA was quickly eliminated in mice 4 h after
injection. Compared to free Cy5-siRNA, the Cy5-siRNA
encapsulated NPs accumulated in tumors within 4 h and
were distinctly observed up to 24 h post-injection at the
tumor site. Subsequently, the tumor and major organs were
collected and imaged after the mice were sacrificed at 24 h
post-injection. As shown in Figure 6B, no fluorescence
signals were observed in the mice treated with free
Cy5-siRNA during the experimental period. The tumor
tissues showed significant fluorescence signals. In
addition, the fluorescence signals were stronger in the liver
and the lung.

The systemic toxicity of NPs was investigated after
intravenous administration to ICR mice once every other
day for a total of three times. The mice exhibited good
activity and death was not observed during treatment.
Blood samples and major organs were collected and
harvested for haematology and histological analysis. As
shown in Table 1, compared to mice injected with the PBS,
there was little elevation of AST, ALT, BUN and Cr in the
blood serum. The intravenous injection of NPs elicited no
remarkable toxicity in the liver and kidney. In addition, the
levels of white blood cells (WBC), RBCs, haemoglobin
(HGB), platelets (PLT), neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes
(LYM), and monocyte (MON) were measured (Table 2).
The above parameters for the nanoparticles showed no
dramatic changes compared with those of the PBS group.
As presented in Figure 7D, the H&E-stained sections of
the main organs were observed. There were no significant
histological differences between the main organs of the
nanoparticle-treated and PBS-treated mice.

Safety evaluation
The haematological biocompatibility of NPmPEG-PE/CaP
was evaluated using a haemolytic experiment in vitro. The
dark red colour of the positive control suggested the rupture

DISCUSSION

amorphous nanoparticles were bioactive and exhibited
enhanced biodegradability [40–42]. In addition, the
nanoparticles with a zeta potential of −16.7 ± 0.8 mV
avoided forming lager aggregates in the presence of
negatively charged serum proteins in blood [43].
Compared with free siRNA and CaP-loaded siRNA,
the hybrid nanoparticle-loaded siRNA could efficiently
deliver siRNA to cells via endocytosis. To investigate
the gene silencing efficiency of siRNA, siRNA must be
released to the cytoplasm after the cellular uptake of the
hybrid nanoparticles with siRNA. As shown in Scheme 1,
the hybrid nanoparticles in the acidic endosome may
increase internal osmotic pressure due to the dissolution of
CaP, leading to swelling and disruption of the endosomal

To prepare stable colloidal CaP nanoparticles,
mPEG-PE was synthesized to generate anionic micelles.
The calcium ions and phosphate ions can self-assembled
to condense siRNA to the mPEG-PE micelles and formed
stabilized nanoparticles. Simple CaP precipitation was
difficult to control, and bulky agglomerates formed
naturally [38]. The outer mPEG of the nanoparticles
successfully inhibited the CaP precipitates from increasing
in size and could facilitated longer circulation times for
the intravenously administered particles. Moreover, the
PEG chains inhibited CaP forming crystalline long-range
order structures [39]. In contrast to crystalline CaP, the

membrane. Cy5-siRNA encapsulated NPs could be
protected from RNase degradation, obviously enhancing
Cy5-siRNA accumulation in tumor tissue through the EPR
effect and quickly releasing Cy5-siRNA in intracellular
acidic conditions (Scheme 1). The higher accumulation
of nanoparticles in the lung may have been a result of
the aggregates lodging in fenestrated capillaries. Some
particles may have adsorbed to different types or amounts
of serum proteins and became entrapped in the capillary
bed of the lung [44–47]. The fluorescence signal was
weaker in the liver because most of the nanoparticles were
not captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS)
and the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the liver.

CaP is considered the most biocompatible inorganic
biomaterial and is a suitable candidate drug carriers as
it is the main mineral found in human bone and teeth
[48, 49]. Moreover, natural cephalin is a major component
of cell membranes and is considered an excellent
biocompatibile biomaterial. The biocompatibility of
hybrid nanopariticles was studied by testing haemolytic
activity, cytotoxicity and systemic toxicity. The results of
this study demonstrated that the haemolysis percentage of
NPmPEG-PE/CaP at the highest concentration of 1000 μg/mL
was still low (12%) due to the mPEG on the surface of
NPmPEG-PE/CaP. The nanoparticles possessed a negligible
cytotoxicity even at hybrid nanoparticles concentrations

of 2000 µg/mL. In addition, the intravenous injection
of nanoparticles induced no obvious toxicity under the
experimental conditions. Overall, mPEG-PE and CaP
hybrid nanoparticles are suitable candidates for drug
carriers due to their excellent biocompatibility.
In conclusion, an amphiphilic mPEG-PE copolymer
was synthesized by conjugating PE with mPEG-COOH.
We have developed a hybrid nanocarrier system consisting
of CaP and an mPEG-PE copolymer for safe and efficient
siRNA delivery. It was demonstrated that mPEG-PE/CaP
nanoparticles showed stable properties, good
biocompatibility and effective cell uptake. Moreover,
the vehicles can delivered siRNA to liver cancer cells
in vivo and did not activate an innate immune response.
Consequently, the mPEG-PE/CaP hybrid nanoparticles
are promising siRNA loading systems thatcan be used for
cancer treatment.

mPEG-COOH (1 g) and PE (0.4 g) were dissolved
in 4 mL of TCM. After the mixture was stirred for 1 h at
25°C, and EDC·HCl (192 mg) and NHS (115 mg) were
added to the solution. The solution was allowed to react
for 24 h at room temperature and was subsequently poured
into anhydrous diethyl ether. The precipitate was washed
twice with anhydrous diethyl ether, dried under vacuum
and stored at 4°C. After drying under vacuum, mPEG-PE
was obtained as a yellow powder.
The chemical structure of mPEG-PE was confirmed
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. 1H NMR
spectra were measured using a Bruker Avance 400
(400 MHz) spectrometer in deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet NEXCU 670).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

mPEG-PE (40 mg) was dissolved in 4 mL TCM
and dried under vacuum. After evaporating the TCM, the
residual membrane was dispersed in 4 mL of Tris-HCl
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4) to form mPEG-PE micelles. The
micelles were stored at 4°C.
siRNA (150 μL of 20 μM) was added to 100 μL of
a 100 mM CaCl2 solution, and was subsequently mixed
with 250 μL of an mPEG-PE (1 mg/mL) solution. HBS
(500 μL; 50 mM Hepes, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na3PO4,
pH = 7.4) was quickly added to the mPEG-PE/Ca2+/siRNA
solution and was allowed to react for 30 min. To remove
the excess Ca2+, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at
1000 g and 4°C for 1 h using Amicon® Ultra-4 centrifugal
filter devices (MWCO: 10 kDa). The sample solution was
used in further experiments.
The particle size, polydispersity index (PDI)
and zeta potential of the prepared nanoparticles were
determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS, Malvern) measurements.
To observe the morphology of the nanoparticles, the
nanoparticle solution was dropped onto a 300-mesh
carboncoated copper grid and the excess solution was
removed using a filter paper. The grid was allowed to dry
at room temperature and was observed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (H-800, Hitachi, Japan).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out
on a Rigaku D/Max-2550PC X-ray diffractometer using
Cu Kα radiation.

Then, the RBCs were diluted to 20% (v/v) of their
volume with PBS. RBC solution (100 μL) was added
into 400 μL of the NPmPEG-PE/CaP solution at different

(100 nM Cy3-siRNA) for different amounts of time.
The SMMC-7721 cells were washed 3 times with PBS
and were stained with Hoechst33342 for 5 min. The
intracellular distribution of nanoparticles was visualized
with a FV-1200 Olympus confocal microscope.
SMMC-7721 cells (1 × 105) were seeded onto
6-well plates with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After
24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing NP/FAM-siRNA nanoparticles (100 nM FAMsiRNA). At different time points, the cells were washed
with PBS and detached with trypsin. The cellular uptake
of FAM-siRNA was monitored using flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, BD Bioscience).

Systemic toxicity assay
The hybrid nanoparticles solutions were
intravenously injected into the mice once every two days
for a total of three times. The blood and major organs were
collected at 24 h after the last injection. Blood routine tests
were performed and the levels of alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), aspirate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Cr) were measured
in serum samples. Major organs including the heart, liver,
spleen, lung and kidney were fixed and processed thereafter
for haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining.

In vivo distribution of NPmPEG-PE/CaP/Cy5-siRNA
To construct animal tumor models, SMMC-7721
cells (1 × 106) were subcutaneously injected into the
flank region of female nude mice (approximately 20 g).
When the tumors grew to approximately 500 mm3 in size,
mice were intravenously injected with free Cy5-siRNA
and NP/Cy5-siRNA at a Cy5-siRNA dose of 1.2 mg/kg.
Fluorescence imags were acquired at the predetermined
intervals, using a fluorescence imaging system
(LB 983, Berthold Technologies Gmbh & Co.KG).
