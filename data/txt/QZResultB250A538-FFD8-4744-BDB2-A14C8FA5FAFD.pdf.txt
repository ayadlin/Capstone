Abstract:

Recent developments in multi-functional nanoparticles offer a great potential for
targeted delivery of therapeutic compounds and imaging contrast agents to specific
cell types, in turn, enhancing therapeutic effect and minimizing side effects. Despite
the promise, site specific delivery carriers have not been translated into clinical
reality. In this study, we have developed long circulating liposomes with the outer
surface decorated with thioated oligonucleotide aptamer (thioaptamer) against
E-selectin (ESTA) and evaluated the targeting efficacy and PK parameters. In
vitro targeting studies using Human Umbilical Cord Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC)
demonstrated efficient and rapid uptake of the ESTA conjugated liposomes (ESTAlip). In vivo, the intravenous administration of ESTA-lip resulted in their accumulation
at the tumor vasculature of breast tumor xenografts without shortening the
circulation half-life. The study presented here represents an exemplary use of
thioaptamer for targeting and opens the door to testing various combinations of
thioaptamer and nanocarriers that can be constructed to target multiple cancer
types and tumor components for delivery of both therapeutics and imaging agents.

targeting through leaky vessels, which is a hallmark
of tumor vasculature [4, 5]. This class of nanoparticles
improves the solubility, toxicity profile, and unfavorable
pharmacokinetics of the chemotherapeutics. However,
the therapeutic efficacy remains largely unchanged [6,
7]. Therefore, development of a tool to allow for constant
and selective delivery of therapeutics is desirable. Active
targeting can be achieved by efficient recognition of
tumor specific antigens that are differentially expressed
cell surface proteins between normal and tumor. An
affinity-based interaction between the antigens and
targeted ligand increase delivery efficacy by enhancing

Treatment for solid tumors has largely relied on
initial surgical intervention and subsequent scheduled
cytotoxic chemotherapies. However, the vast majority
of malignancies have proven to be resistant to these
approaches, partially due to the requisite dose limitations
for preventing adverse effects on normal tissues. Recent
advances in multi-functional drug delivery systems
provide insight into development of nanoscale carriers for
cancer treatment and imaging [1-3]. Current nanoscale

the retention of nanoparticles and elevating cellular uptake
while minimizing side effects associated with potential
off-targeting [1].
Among tumor components, tumor vasculature is
an attractive target for the delivery of anti-cancer and
imaging contrast agents. The concept of tumor vasculature
targeting is substantially distinct from targeting cancer
cells [1, 8]. When nanoparticles are administered
intravenously to target cancer cells, they are required
to physically cross over the layers of endothelial lining
against oncotic pressure that is generated from inside the
tumor microenvironment. In contrast, for vasculature
targeted nanoparticles, the intended molecular targets
on the endothelial cell surface are readily accessible to
the circulating nanoparticles. Tumor vasculature is in
an inflamed state and overexpresses several important
factors such as adhesion molecules [9, 10]. E-selectin
(CD62E, ELAM-1 or LECAM-2) is selectively
expressed in inflamed vasculature in advanced tumors
by cytokines that are secreted in the inflammatory tumor
microenvironment [11-13]. The inducible nature of
E-selectin in the inflammatory environment would allow
for site specific delivery of nanoparticle to the inflamed
tumor vasculature and possibly to tumor parenchyma
via subsequent extravasation. We recently identified
a thiophosphate-backbone modified oligonucleotide
aptamer (“thio”aptamer) that binds E-selectin
expressed on endothelial cells with high affinity and
specificity [14]. In this study, we developed E-selectin
thioaptamer conjugated stealth liposomes and analyzed
physico-chemical properties, targeting efficiency, and
pharmacokinetics. We herein report on 1) application of

targeting, and 3) the effect of aptamer conjugation on
pharmacokinetics of stealth liposomes.

RESULTS
Development of ESTA conjugated liposomes
We first developed ESTA conjugated liposome
(ESTA-lip) for effective vasculature targeting. The
efficiency of conjugation was evaluated by coupling
Cy3 labeled carboxylated ESTA (COOH-Cy3-ESTA) on
amino PEGylated stealth liposome (NH2-PEG-lip) (A)
and the intensity of red fluorescence was measured at
anexcitation/ emission of 544/594 nm using a fluorimeter.
A linear standard curve was generated from Cy3-labeled
ESTA. Approximately 50% of the surface amino groups
presenton the liposome were conjugated to the ESTA
(~485 ESTA molecules conjugated to one liposome) (Fig.
1B). The physico-chemical properties of the liposomes
wereanalyzed by a zeta-sizer and Fourier Transform
InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR). The size of NH2-PEGlip was 110.2nm in average, and ESTA conjugation
caused a slight increase of size of the liposomes (119.3
nm) (Fig. 1C). The analysis of zeta-potential showed
that ESTA conjugation resulted in a substantial change
of the surface charge of the NH2-PEG lip from +5.5 ±
1.7 mV to -5.6 ± 2.8 mV (Fig. 1C). This indicated that
the positive charge of the amino groups on the liposome
surface was substituted by the negatively charged ESTA.

Additionally, the spectra acquired from FTIR analysis of
the Cy3-ESTA-lip were compared to the NH2 PEG lip and
ESTA (Fig. 1D). A reduction in peaks corresponding to
C=O stretch (1650 cm-1) and C-O stretch (1230 cm-1) as
compared to the non-reactive peak corresponding to P=O
bending (1040 cm-1) was observed in ESTA-lip. The O-H
bend in the COOH-ESTA (1480 cm-1) appeared slightly
shifted and partially reactive due to the contribution of
O-H from water. Taken together, these data demonstrated
the successful conjugation of COOH-Cy3-ESTA to the
NH2-PEG-lip.

saline) resulted in an accumulation of red fluorescence
on the tumor vasculature (Fig. 2C, right), while minimal
level of fluorescence was detected around the vessel area
when un-conjugated-lip was injected (data not shown). In
contrast, ESTA conjugation did not affect accumulation
of liposomes in the sinusoidal organs (data not shown).
These data demonstrated that ESTA-lip preferentially
binds to E-selectin expressing human and mouse
endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 48 h
after the injection, ESTA-lip accumulation in the tumor
parenchyma was increased markedly (Fig. 2D), suggesting
that enhanced tumor vasculature targeting may facilitate
subsequent extravasation of the liposomes into tumor
parenchyma. Interestingly, the appearance of speckled
patterns obtained from these experiments was similar to
that of ESTA alone [14]. This speckled pattern might be
due to either intracellular vesicle localization or simply
a reflection of clustered and discontinuous E-selectin
expression pattern on the cell surface [15]. Several studies
suggest that E-selectin internalizes and undergoes a
recycling following membrane sorting. In addition, our
3-D confocal imaging analysis of E-selectin expressing
endothelial cells demonstrated intracellular localization of
ESTA, suggesting internalization of ESTA (unpublished).
Although binding kinetics were not measured, 50% of
the coverage of the liposomes containing 1.1 % aminePEG with ESTA was sufficient to produce high-retention
kinetics (Fig. 2B and C). In this study, we formulated the
liposomes to contain 1.1% of amino-PEG, although the
ratio can be modified up to 5% to further enhance the
amounts of ESTA bioconjugation to increase binding
specificity and affinity.

Binding of ESTA-lip to inflamed endothelial cells
To test binding efficiency of ESTA-lip in vitro,
HUVEC were stimulated with TNF-α to induce E-selectin
expression on the cell membrane. TNF-α treatment
increased the expression of E-selectin more than 20fold when compared to untreated cells (Fig. 2A). The
TNF-α treated cells were used to test the ability of the
Cy3-ESTA-lip-FITC (Cy3-ESTA conjugated liposome
containing FITC) to bind to E-selectin on the HUVEC
cell surface. The cells treated with Cy3-ESTA-lip-FITC
at a concentration of 10 nM showed intense FITC and
Cy3 fluorescence in the cells stimulated with TNF-α
when compared with un-stimulated controls (Fig. 2B).
The merged fluorescence of FITC and Cy3 suggest that
the Cy3-ESTA-lip-FITC were internalized after binding
to E-selectin on the cell surface. This co-migration of
both thioaptamer and liposome was observed within 24
hours (data not shown). Regardless of TNF stimuli, unconjugated liposomes as negative control only showed
minor interaction to the cells and the fluorescent signal was
almost undetectable after normalization (supplemental
figure 1). To further examine selective binding of ESTAlip to E-selectin in vivo, ESTA-lip-Rhodamine was i.v.
injected into mice bearing breast tumor xenografts (Figure
2C). The expression level of E-selectin was upregulated on
the tumor vasculature of xenograft tumors, predominantly
expressed in or neighboring regions of tumor stroma
(Fig. 2C, left). The mouse bearing tumors received an
injection of ESTA-lip-Rhodamine via tail vain, and the
mice were sacrificed 5 h post-injection to harvest the
tumor and the major organs. Intravenous bolus injection
of the ESTA-lip-Rhodamine (3 mg of liposome in 100 µl

Pharmacokinetics of ESTA-lip
Pharmacokinetics of the liposomes was then analyzed
by taking whole blood at different time points after a
single intravenous bolus administration of the ESTA-lipRhodamine or NH2-PEG-lip into 10 weeks old FBV mice.
The fluorescence intensity originated from Rhodamine in
the plasma of the treated mice over the untreated mice
was assessed. Following a one compartmental model,
the pharmacokinetics parameters were determined. There
was no significant difference in the initial volume of

mL for NH2-PEG-lip vs. 4.2 ± 0.4 mL for ESTA-lip). On
the other hand, ESTA conjugation resulted in a decrease in
the clearance rate (CL) (0.12 ± 0.03 μg.h for NH2-PEGlip
vs. 0.09 ± 0.01 μg.h for ESTA-lip), and in turn led to an
increase of the area under the curve (AUC) (24848 ± 4897
µg.h/mL for NH2-PEG-lip vs. 33349± 4236 µg.h/mL for
ESTA-lip) and slight extension of the circulation half-life
(T1/2) (23 ± 4 h for the NH2-PEG-lip vs. 32 ± 7 h for ESTAlip). This data supported that the presence of thioaptamer
ligands (ESTA) on the surface of stealth liposomes does
not cause a reduction of the bioavailability.

our finding points to the direction that thioaptamer
conjugation is not likely to cause a loss of stealth effect
of nanoparticles. Active targeting of stealth liposome may
allow for a reduction in the dose of administration and/or
decrease toxicity for the chemotherapeutics. In this study,
we focused on E-selectin targeted thioaptamer (ESTA)
and stealth liposomes, however, the combinations of type
of aptamer and nanoparticles are virtually unlimited for
the development of desirable nanoparticles.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

DISCUSSION

Synthesis of Cy3-labeled carboxylated ESTA

Many targeted delivery systems have been
developed using different types of nanoparticles and
ligands for both imaging and drug delivery [16-20]. While
antibodies have been the mainstay for active targeting, the
use of antibodies or peptide based ligands for nanocarriers
remains a challenge [21-23]. For example, it is difficult
to control the orientation of antibody on the surface of
nanocarriers by chemical conjugation since there are a
number of reactive groups within a molecule, and such
random conjugation may lead to unexpected off-target
effects as well as poor targeting performance. More
importantly, antibody conjugation to carriers causes
a reduction in serum half-life due to the clearance by
phagocytes in tissues and peripheral circulation [21-23].
The use of humanized or fragmented antibodies may
address this issue; however, such strategies appear to be
neither cost effective nor practical. For this reason, we
selected thioaptamer. Aptamers are structurally distinct
RNA and DNA oligonucleotides that have been shown
to mimic protein-binding molecules, and yet exhibit high
(nM to pM) binding affinity and selectivity [24], and
can be an attractive alternative over antibody or peptide
ligands based on their biological and chemical properties
including, 1) small size, 2) high affinity binding, 3) low
toxicity and immunogenicity, 4) simple and inexpensive
chemical synthesis and modification process, and 5)
ability to define the orientation during conjugation[25].
Among the aptamers that have been identified so far,
two DNA classes of aptamers against prostate-specific
membrane antigen (PSMA) [26] and nucleolin [27] have
been conjugated to nanoparticles, for the cancer cell
specific targeted drug delivery, and demonstrated effective
delivery of chemotherapeutic agent specifically to cancer
cells [28, 29].
As expected, ESTA conjugation to stealth liposome
did not compromise the T1/2, and rather caused a slight
extension of the T1/2. The mechanisms underlying extended
T1/2 of ESTA-lip is not clear. One possible explanation
might be that the negative surface charge of ESTA-lip (-7.5
± 0.9 mV) attributed from substitution of the surface amino
groups might have reduced the interaction of ESTA-lip to
the negatively charged immune cell surfaces. Nevertheless,

synthesizer (Expedite 8909, Applied Biosystems) using
the standard phosphoramidite chemistry as described
previously [30]. The 5’ end of the ESTA was coupled with
Cy3 phosphoramidite with the MMT protective group
remaining and followed by the addition of 5’-carboxy
modifier-C10 containing N-hydroxy succinimide
ester protective group. After functionalization, ESTA
was cleaved from the bead support and the protecting
groups were removed with 0.4M methanolic NaOH at
room temperature for 24-36 hr. The resultant ESTA was
further purified and the concentration of the ESTA was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm with a
UV spectrophotometer.

Preparation of ESTA conjugated liposome
(ESTA-lip)
Amino-PEG liposomes were made with a lipid
mixture (50 mM) consisting of DPPC, cholesterol, and
DSPE-PEG (2000) Amine, in a 58.9: 40: 1.1 molar ratio,
dissolved in ethanol and then hydrated with either; (1) 10
mM phosphate buffered saline to prepare empty liposomes
or (2) 1 mM FITC solution for in vitro studies. This was
then sequentially extruded using a Lipex thermoline
extruder to prepare liposomes of approximately 100
nm. The FITC-liposomes were diafiltered through 500
kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes to remove unencapsulated dye. Rhodamine tagged liposomes used
for in vivo studies were extruded as above. DPPC: Chol:
DSPE-PEG (2000) amine : Rhodamine-DHPE at 58.8:
40: 1.1 : 0.1 molar ratio were used. Carboxylated Cy3labeled or unlabeled ESTA was conjugated to amino PEG
liposomes by using carbodiimide chemistry with EDC
and sulfo-NHS. Free ESTA was removed by dialysis.

Characterization of ESTA-lips

In vivo carcinoma mouse model

The size and zeta potential of the ESTA conjugated
liposome were measured using a ZetaPals instrument
(Brookhaven Instruments). 2µl of liposomes were added
to 1.4 mL of 10mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and the
analysis was conducted at room temperature (23°C) in
triplicates. To quantify the concentration of the ESTA
on the liposomes, Cy3 fluorescence from ESTA-lip was
measured and compared with ESTA standard curve. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was preformed to
assess the attachment of ESTA on the liposomes. Samples
were diluted in de-ionized water and FTIR was preformed
on a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). A
2µL drop from each sample was placed on the diamond
crystal and subjected to vacuum. Using a smart diamond
crystal attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory each
sample was run for 150 scans at a resolution of 4 wave
numbers.

5-week old female athymic nu/nu nude mice
(Charles River) were maintained in a VAF-barrier
facility and all animal procedures were performed in
accordance with the regulations in the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Texas Health Science Center at Houston. An orthotopic
breast tumor was established as previously reported
with minor modification. When tumors became palpable
(approx. 200-300 mm3), either encapsulated ESTA-liprhodamine or NH2-PEG-lip (3 mg of total lipid in 100
µl of saline) was intravenously injected into mice via
tail vein (n=3 per group). One day after the injection, the
tumors were harvested and immediately mounted in OCT
media for subsequent histological analysis. To examine
tumor localization of liposomes, the frozen tissues were
sectioned (8 µm thickness) and analyzed by fluorescent
microscope. The frozen sections were also immunostained
as previously reported [14].

Induction of E-selectin expression in HUVEC
cells

Pharmacokinetics of liposomes

To induce E-selectin expression, the cells were
stimulated with TNF-α (10ng/ml) for 2 to 4 h. To
determine E-selectin expression on the endothelial cell
surface, the cells were dissociated with 5 mM EDTA and
then incubated with FITC labeled E-selectin antibody
(Pharmingen). As a negative control, the same amount
of normal IgG was used. The surface fluorescence was
measured by a FACS Caliber. The experiments were
repeated at least three times and data represent an average
value.

Following a single intravenous bolus administration
of the ESTA-Lip-Rhodamine or NH2-PEG-Lip (3 mg
of total lipid in 100 µl of saline) into 10 weeks old FBV
mice (n=3-4), whole blood was collected at different time
points by cardiac puncture. The fluorescence intensity
in the plasma (50 µl) was measured using a fluorimeter
at 544/594 nm (excitation/emission wavelengths) to
determine the pharmacokinetics parameters of each
liposome. Plasma samples were also collected from
untreated mice as a baseline.
