Summary

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We analyzed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation,
exome sequencing, mRNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse phase protein arrays. Our
ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously-defined
gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when
combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity.
Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at > 10% incidence
across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene
mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with
the Luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein expression-defined subgroups, possibly
contributed by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific
signaling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/p-HER2/HER1/pHER1 signature within the HER2-Enriched expression subtype. Comparison of Basal-like breast
tumors with high-grade Serous Ovarian tumors showed many molecular commonalities,
suggesting a related etiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biologic finding of the
four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic
abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and
heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biologic subtypes of breast cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with greater than 1,300,000 cases and
450,000 deaths each year world-wide. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized
into three basic therapeutic groups. The Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive group are the most
numerous and diverse, with several genomic tests to assist in predicting outcomes for ER+
patients receiving endocrine therapy1,2. The HER2/ERBB2 amplified group3 is a great
clinical success because of effective therapeutic targeting of HER2/ERBB2, which has led to
intense efforts to characterize other DNA copy number aberrations4,5. Triple Negative
Breast Cancers (TNBC), also known as Basal-like breast cancers6, are a group with only
chemotherapy options, and an increased incidence in patients with germline BRCA1
mutations7,8 or of African ancestry9.

Most molecular studies of breast cancer have focused on just one or two high information
content platforms, most frequently mRNA expression profiling or DNA copy number
analysis, and more recently massively parallel sequencing10–12. Supervised clustering of
mRNA expression data has reproducibly established that breast cancers encompass several
distinct disease entities, often referred to as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer13,14. The
recent development of additional high information content assays focused on abnormalities
in DNA methylation, microRNA expression and protein expression, provide further
opportunities to more completely characterize the molecular architecture of breast cancer. In
this study, a diverse set of breast tumors were assayed using six different technology
platforms. Individual platform and integrated pathway analyses identified many subtypespecific mutations and copy number changes that identify therapeutically tractable genomic
aberrations and other events driving tumor biology.

Samples and clinical data
Tumor and germline DNA samples were obtained from 825 patients. Different subsets of
patients were assayed on each platform: 466 tumors from 463 patients had data available on
five platforms including Agilent mRNA expression microarrays (n=547), Illumina Infinium
DNA methylation chips (n=802), Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays (n=773), microRNA
sequencing (n=697), and whole exome sequencing (n=507); in addition, 348 of the 466
samples also had Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data (n=403). Due to the short
median overall follow up (17 months) and the small number of overall survival events
(93/818), survival analyses will be presented in a later publication. Demographic and
clinical characteristics are presented in Supplemental Table 1.

Significantly mutated genes in breast cancer
Overall, 510 tumors from 507 patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing,
identifying 30,626 somatic mutations comprised of 28,319 point mutations, 4 dinucleotide
mutations, and 2,302 indels (ranging from 1 to 53 nucleotides). The point mutations
included 6,486 silent, 19,045 missense, 1,437 nonsense, 26 read-through, 506 splice-site
mutations, and 819 mutations in RNA genes. Comparison to COSMIC and OMIM databases
identified 619 mutations across 177 previously reported cancer genes. Of 19,045 missense
mutations, 9,484 were predicted to have a high probability of being deleterious by Condel15.
The MuSiC package (Dees et al., submitted), which determines the significance of the
observed mutation rate of each gene based on the background mutation rate, identified 35
Significantly Mutated Genes/SMG (excluding LOC or ENSG genes) by at least two tests
(Convolution and Likelihood Ratio tests) with FDR < 5% (Supplemental Table 2).

Author Manuscript

In addition to identifying nearly all genes previously implicated in breast cancer (PIK3CA,
PTEN, AKT1, TP53, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MLL3, MAP3K1 and CDKN1B), a number of
novel SMGs were identified including TBX3, RUNX1, CBFB, AFF2, PIK3R1, PTPN22,
PTPRD, NF1, SF3B1, and CCND3. TBX3, which is mutated in Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome
and involved in mammary gland development16, harbored 13 mutations (8 frame-shift
indels, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 nonsense, and 3 missense), suggesting a loss of function.
Additionally, 2 mutations were found in TBX4 and 1 mutation in TBX5, which are genes

involved in Holt-Oram Syndrome17. Two other transcription factors, CTCF and FOXA1,
were at or near significance harboring 13 and 8 mutations, respectively. RUNX1 and CBFB,
both rearranged in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and interfering with hematopoietic
differentiation, harbored 19 and 9 mutations, respectively. PIK3R1 contained 14 mutations,
most of which clustered in the PIK3CA interaction domain similar to previously identified
mutations in glioma18 and endometrial cancer19. We also observed a statistically significant
exclusion pattern among PIK3R1, PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations (P = 0.025).
Mutation of splicing factor SF3B1, previously described in Myelodysplastic Syndromes20
and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia21, was significant with 15 non-silent mutations, of
which 4 were a recurrent K700E substitution. Two protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPN22
and PTPRD) were also significantly mutated; frequent deletion/mutation of PTPRD is
observed in lung adenocarcinoma22.

Association between mutations and mRNA-expression subtypes

Author Manuscript

We analyzed the somatic mutation spectrum within the context of the four mRNAexpression subtypes, excluding the Normal-like group due to small numbers (n=8) (Figure
1). Several SMGs showed mRNA-subtype (Supplemental Figures 1–3) and clinical-subtype
specific patterns of mutation (Supplemental Table 2). SMGs were considerably more diverse
and recurrent within Luminal A and Luminal B tumors than within Basal-like and HER2E
subtypes; however, the overall mutation rate was lowest in Luminal A subtype and highest
in the Basal-like and HER2E subtypes. The Luminal A subtype harbored the most SMGs,
with the most frequent being PIK3CA (45%), followed by MAP3K1, GATA3, TP53, CDH1,
and MAP2K4. 12% of Luminal A tumors contained likely inactivating mutations in
MAP3K1 and MAP2K4, which represent two contiguous steps in the p38/JNK1 stress kinase
pathway23. Luminal B cancers exhibited a diversity of SMGs with TP53 and PIK3CA (29%
each) being the most frequent. The luminal tumor subtypes markedly contrasted with Basallike cancers where TP53 mutations occurred in 80% of cases and the majority of the
Luminal SMG repertoire, except PIK3CA (9%), were absent or near absent. The HER2Enriched subtype (HER2E), which has frequent HER2/ERBB2 amplification (80%), had a
hybrid pattern with a high frequency of TP53 (72%) and PIK3CA(39%) mutations and a
much lower frequency of other SMGs including PIK3R1 (4%).

Author Manuscript

Intrinsic mRNA-subtypes differed not only by mutation frequencies, but also by mutation
type. Most notably, TP53 mutations in Basal-like tumors were mostly nonsense and frameshift, while missense mutations predominated in Luminal A and B tumors (Supplemental
Figure 1). 58 somatic GATA3 mutations, some of which were previously described24, were
detected including a hot spot 2bp deletion within intron 4 only in the Luminal A subtype
(13/13 mutants) (Supplemental Figure 2). In contrast, 7/9 frame-shift mutations in exon 5
(DNA binding domain) occurred in Luminal B cancers. PIK3CA mutation frequency and
spectrum also varied by mRNA-subtype (Supplemental Figure 3); the recurrent PIK3CA
E545K mutation was present almost exclusively within Luminal A (25/27) tumors. CDH1
mutations were common (30/36) within the lobular histologic subtype and corresponded
with lower CDH1 mRNA (Supplemental Figure 4) and protein expression. Finally, we
identified 4/8 somatic variants in HER2/ERBB2 within lobular cancers, 3 of which were
within the tyrosine kinase domain.

We performed analyses on a selected set of genes25 using the normal tissue DNA data and
detected a number of germline predisposing variants. These analyses identified 47/507
patients with deleterious germline variants, representing nine different genes (ATM, BRCA1,
BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, NBN, PTEN, RAD51C, and TP53; Supplementary Table 3),
supporting the hypothesis that ~10% of sporadic breast cancers may have a strong germline
contribution. These data confirmed the association between the presence of germline BRCA1
mutations and Basal-like breast cancers7,8.

Gene expression analyses (mRNA and microRNA)

Author Manuscript

Several approaches were used to look for structure in the mRNA expression data. We
performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of 525 tumors and 22 tumoradjacent normal tissues using the top 3,662 variably expressed genes (Supplemental Figure
5); SigClust analysis identified 12 classes (5 classes with >9 samples/class). We performed a
semi-supervised hierarchical cluster analysis using a previously published “intrinsic gene
list”14, which identified 13 classes (9 classes with >9 samples/class) (Supplemental Figure
6). We also classified each sample using the 50-gene PAM50 model14 (Supplemental Figure
5). High concordance was observed between all three, therefore, we used the PAM50defined subtype predictor as a common classification metric. There were only 8 Normal-like
and 8 Claudin-low tumors26, thus no analyses focused on these two subtypes were
performed.

Author Manuscript

MicroRNA expression levels were assayed via Illumina sequencing, using 1222 miRBase27
v16 mature and star strands as the reference database of microRNA transcripts/genes. Seven
subtypes were identified by consensus NMF clustering using an abundance matrix
containing the 25% most variable microRNAs (306 transcripts/genes or MIMATs). These
subtypes correlated with mRNA-subtypes, ER, PR and HER2 clinical status (Supplemental
Figure 7). Of note, microRNA groups 4 and 5 showed high overlap with the Basal-like
mRNA subtype and contained many TP53 mutations. The remaining microRNA groups (1–
3, 6 and 7) were composed of a mixture of Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2-positive
tumors with little correlation with the PAM50 defined subtypes. With the exception of
TP53, which showed a strong positive correlation, and PIK3CA and GATA3 that showed
negative associations with groups 4 and 5 respectively, there was little correlation with
mutation status and microRNA subtype.

DNA methylation

Author Manuscript

llumina Infinium DNA methylation arrays were used to assay 802 breast tumors. Data from
HumanMethylation27 (HM27) and HumanMethylation450 (HM450) arrays were combined
and filtered to yield a common set of 574 probes used in an unsupervised clustering analysis,
which identified five distinct DNA methylation groups (Supplemental Figure 8). Group 3
showed a hyper-methylated phenotype and was significantly enriched for Luminal B
mRNA-subtype and under-represented for PIK3CA and MAP3K1/MAP2K4 mutations.
Group 5 showed the lowest levels of DNA methylation, overlapped with the Basal-like
mRNA-subtype, and showed a high frequency of TP53 mutations. HER2-positive clinical

status, or the HER2E mRNA subtype, had only a modest association with the methylation
subtypes.
A supervised analysis of the DNA methylation and mRNA expression data was performed
to compare the DNA methylation Group 3 (N=49) versus all tumors in groups 1, 2, and 4
(excluding Group 5 that consisted predominantly of Basal-like tumors). This analysis
identified 4,283 genes differentially methylated (3,735 higher in Group 3 tumors) and 1,899
genes differentially expressed (1,232 downregulated); 490 genes were both methylated and
showed lower expression in Group 3 tumors (Supplemental Table 4). A DAVID functional
annotation analysis identified ‘Extracellular region part’ and ‘Wnt signaling pathway’ to be
associated with this 490 gene-set; the Group 3 hyper-methylated samples showed fewer
PIK3CA and MAP3K1 mutations, and lower expression of Wnt-pathway genes.

Author Manuscript

DNA copy number

Author Manuscript

773 breast tumors were assayed using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays. Segmentation analysis
and GISTIC were used to identify focal amplifications/deletions and arm-level gains and
losses (Supplemental Table 5). These analyses confirmed all previously reported copy
number variations and highlighted a number of SMGs including focal amplification of
regions containing PIK3CA, HER1/EGFR, FOXA1, and HER2/ERBB2, as well as focal
deletions of regions containing MLL3, PTEN, RB1 and MAP2K4 (Supplemental Figure 9);
in all cases, multiple genes were included within each altered region. Importantly, many of
these copy number changes correlated with mRNA-subtype including characteristic loss of
5q and gain of 10p in Basal-like cancers5,28 and gain of 1q and/or 16q loss in Luminal
tumors4. NMF clustering of GISTIC segments identified five copy number clusters/groups
that correlated with mRNA-subtypes, ER, PR and HER2 clinical status, and TP53 mutation
status (Supplemental Figure 10). In addition, this aCGH subtype classification was highly
correlated with the aCGH subtypes recently defined by Curtis et al.29(Supplemental Figure
11).

Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA)

Author Manuscript

Quantified expression of 171 cancer-related proteins and phospho-proteins by RPPA was
performed on 403 breast tumors30. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses identified
seven subtypes; one class contained too few cases for further analysis (Supplemental Figure
12). These protein subtypes were highly concordant with the mRNA-subtypes, particularly
with Basal-like and HER2E mRNA subtypes. Closer examination of the HER2-containing
RPPA-defined subgroup showed coordinated overexpression of HER2 and HER1 with a
strong concordance with phosphorylated HER2 (pY1248) and HER1 (pY992), likely from
heterodimerization and cross-phosphorylation. While there is a potential for modest cross
reactivity of antibodies against these related total and phosphoproteins, the concordance of
phosphorylation of HER2 and HER1 was confirmed using multiple independent antibodies.
In RPPA-defined Luminal tumors, there was high protein expression of ER, PR, AR, BCL2,
GATA3 and INPP4B, defining mostly Luminal A cancers and a second more heterogeneous
protein subgroup composed of both Luminal A and Luminal B cancers. Two potentially
novel protein-defined subgroups were identified: Reactive I consisted primarily of a subset

of Luminal A tumors, whereas Reactive II consisted of a mixture of mRNA-subtypes. These
groups are termed ‘Reactive’ because many of the characteristic proteins are likely produced
by the microenvironment and/or cancer-activated fibroblasts including Fibronectin, Caveolin
1 and Collagen VI. These two RPPA groups did not have a marked difference in the %
tumor cell content versus each other, or the other protein subtypes, as assessed by SNP array
analysis or pathological examination. In addition, supervised analyses of Reactive I vs. II
groups using microRNA expression, DNA methylation, mutation, or DNA copy number
data identified no significant differences between these groups, while similar supervised
analyses using protein and mRNA expression identified many differences.

Multi-platform subtype discovery

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To reveal higher order structure in breast tumors based on multiple data types, significant
clusters/subtypes from each of five platforms were analyzed using a multi-platform data
matrix subjected to unsupervised Consensus Clustering (Figure 2). This “Cluster of
Clusters” (C of C) approach illustrated that Basal-like cancers had the most distinct multiplatform signature since all the different platforms for the Basal-like groups clustered
together. To a great extent, the four major C of C subdivisions correlated well with the
previously-published mRNA-subtypes (driven in part by the fact that the four intrinsic
subtypes were one of the inputs). Therefore, we also performed C of C analysis with no
mRNA data present (Supplemental Figure 13) or with the 12 unsupervised mRNA subtypes
(Supplemental Figure 14), and in each case 4–6 groups were identified. Recent work by
Curtis et al. identified 10 copy number based subgroups in a 997 breast cancer set29. We
evaluated this classification in a C of C analysis instead of our 5-class copy number
subtypes, with either the PAM50 (Supplemental Figure 15) or 12 unsupervised mRNA
subtypes (Supplemental Figure 16); each of these C of C classifications were highly
correlated with PAM50 mRNA-subtypes and with the other C of C analyses (Figure 2). The
transcriptional profiling and RPPA platforms demonstrated a high correlation with the
consensus structure suggesting that the information content from copy number aberrations,
microRNAs, and methylation is captured at the level of gene expression and protein
function.

Luminal/ER-positive summary analysis

Author Manuscript

Luminal/ER-positive breast cancers are the most heterogeneous in terms of gene expression
(Supplemental Figure 5), mutation spectrum (Figure 1), copy number changes
(Supplemental Figure 9) and patient outcomes1,14. One of the most dominant features is
high mRNA and protein expression of the luminal expression signature (Supplemental
Figure 5), which contains ESR1, GATA3, FOXA1, XBP1 and cMYB; the Luminal/ERpositive cluster also contained the largest number of SMGs. Most notably, GATA3 and
FOXA1 were mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion, while ESR1 and XBP1 were typically
highly expressed but infrequently mutated. Mutations in RUNX1 and its dimerization partner
CBFB may also play a role in aberrant ER-signaling in Luminals as RUNX1 functions as an
ER “DNA tethering factor”31. PARADIGM32 analysis comparing Luminal vs. Basal-like
cancers further emphasized the presence of a hyperactivated FOXA1/ER complex as a
critical network hub differentiating these two tumor subtypes (Supplemental Figure 17).

A confirmatory finding here was the high mutation frequency of PIK3CA in Luminal/ERpositive breast cancers33,34. Through multiple technology platforms, we examined possible
relationships between PIK3CA mutation, PTEN loss, INPP4B loss and multiple gene and
protein expression signatures of pathway activity. RPPA data demonstrated that pAKT, pS6
and p4EBP1, typical markers of PI3K pathway activation, were not elevated in PIK3CAmutated Luminal A cancers; instead, they were highly expressed in Basal-like and HER2E
mRNA-subtypes (the latter having frequent PIK3CA mutations) and correlated strongly with
INPP4B and PTEN loss, and to a degree with PIK3CA amplification. Similarly, protein35
and three mRNA signatures36–38 of PI3K pathway activation were enriched in Basal-like
over Luminal A cancers (Figure 3A). This apparent disconnect between the presence of
PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of pathway activation has been previously noted35.

Author Manuscript

Another striking Luminal/ER-positive subtype finding was the frequent mutation of
MAP3K1 and MAP2K4, which represent two contiguous steps within the p38/JNK1
pathway23,39. These mutations are predicted to be inactivating, with MAP2K4 also a target
of focal DNA loss in Luminal tumors (Supplemental Figure 9). To explore the possible
interplay between PIK3CA and MAP3K1/MAP2K4 signaling, MEMo analysis40 was
performed to identify mutually exclusive alterations targeting frequently altered genes likely
to belong to the same pathway (Figure 4). Across all breast cancers, MEMo identified a set
of modules that highlight the differential activation events within the Receptor Tyrosine
Kinase (RTK)/PI3K pathway (Figure 4A); mutations of PIK3CA were very common in
Luminal/ER-positive cancers while PTEN loss was more common in Basal-like tumors.
Almost all MAP3K1/MAP2K4 mutations were in Luminal tumors, yet MAP3K1 and
MAP2K4 appeared almost mutually exclusive relative to one another.

Author Manuscript

The TP53 pathway was differentially inactivated in Luminal/ER-positive breast cancers,
with a low TP53 mutation frequency in Luminal A (12%) and a higher frequency in Luminal
B (29%) (Figure 1). In addition to TP53 itself, a number of other pathway-inactivating
events occurred including ATM loss and MDM2 amplification (Figure 3B and 4B), both of
which occurred more frequently within Luminal B cancers. Gene expression analysis
demonstrated that individual markers of functional TP53 (GADD45A and CDKN1A), and
TP53 activity41,42 signatures, were highest in Luminal A (Figure 3B). These data suggest
that the TP53 pathway remains largely intact in Luminal A but is often inactivated in the
more aggressive Luminal B43. Other PARADIGM-based pathway differences driving
Luminal B versus Luminal A included hyperactivation of transcriptional activity associated
with cMYC and FOXM1/proliferation.

Author Manuscript

The critical retinoblastoma/RB1 pathway also showed mRNA-subtype specific alterations
(Figure 3C). RB1 itself, by mRNA and protein expression, was detectable in most Luminal
cancers with highest levels within Luminal A. A common oncogenic event was Cyclin D1
amplification and high expression, which preferentially occurred within Luminal tumors,
and more specifically within Luminal B. In contrast, the presumed tumor suppressor p18/
CDKN2C was at its lowest levels in Luminal A, consistent with observations from mouse
models44. Lastly, RB1 activity signatures were also high in Luminal cancers45–47. Luminal
A tumors, which have the best prognosis, are the most likely to retain activity of the major
tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53.

These genomic characterizations also provided clues for druggable targets. We compiled a
drug target table in which we defined a target as a gene/protein for which there is an
approved or investigational drug in human clinical trials targeting the molecule or canonical
pathway (Supplemental Table 6). In Luminal/ER-positive cancers, the high frequency of
PIK3CA mutations suggests that inhibitors of this activated kinase or its signaling pathway
may be beneficial. Other potential SMG drug candidates include AKT1 inhibitors (11/12
AKT1 variants were Luminal) and PARP inhibitors for BRCA1/2 mutations. Though still
unapproved as biomarkers, many potential copy number-based drug targets were identified
including amplifications of FGFRs and IGFR1, as well as Cyclin D1/CDK4/CDK6. A
summary of the general findings in Luminal tumors and the other subtypes is presented in
Table 1.
HER2-based classifications and summary analysis

Author Manuscript

DNA amplification of HER2/ERBB2 was readily evident in this study (Supplemental Figure
9), together with overexpression of multiple HER2-amplicon associated genes that in part,
define the HER2-Enriched (HER2E) mRNA-subtype (Supplemental Figure 5). However,
not all clinically HER2+ tumors are of the HER2E mRNA-subtype, and not all tumors in the
HER2E mRNA-subtype are clinically HER2+. Integrated analysis of the RPPA and mRNA
data clearly identified a HER2+ group (Supplemental Figure 12). When the HER2-positive
protein and HER2E mRNA-subtypes overlapped, a strong signal of HER1, p-HER1, HER2,
and p-HER2 was observed. However, only ~50% of clinically HER2-positive tumors fall
into this HER2E-mRNA-subtype/HER2-protein group, the rest of the clinically HER2positive tumors were observed predominantly in the Luminal mRNA subtypes.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

These data suggest that there exist at least two types of clinically defined HER2-positive
tumors. To identify differences between these groups, a supervised gene expression analysis
comparing 36 HER2E-mRNA-subtype/HER2-positive versus 31 Luminal-mRNA-subtype/
HER2-positive tumors was performed and identified 302 differentially expressed genes (qvalue = 0%) (Supplemental Figure 18, Supplemental Table 7). These genes largely track
with ER status but also indicated that HER2E-mRNA-subtype/HER2-positive tumors
showed significantly higher expression of a number of RTKs including FGFR4, HER1/
EGFR, HER2 itself, as well as genes within the HER2-amplicon (i.e. GRB7). Conversely,
the Luminal-mRNA-subtype/HER2-positive tumors showed higher expression of the
Luminal cluster of genes including GATA3, BCL2, and ESR1. Further support for two types
of clinically-defined HER2+ disease was evident in the somatic mutation data supervised by
either mRNA-subtype or ER status; TP53 mutations were significantly enriched in HER2E
or ER-negative tumors while GATA3 mutations were only observed in Luminal subtypes or
ER-positive tumors.
Analysis of the RPPA data according to mRNA-subtype identified 36 differentially
expressed proteins (q-value <5%) (Supplemental Figure 18G, Supplemental Table 8). The
HER1/p-HER1/HER2/p-HER2 signal was again observed and present within the HER2EmRNA-subtype/HER2-positive tumors, as was high p-SRC and p-S6; conversely, many
protein markers of Luminal cancers again distinguished the Luminal-mRNA-subtype/HER2positive tumors. Given the importance of clinical HER2 status, a more focused analysis was

performed based upon the RPPA-defined protein expression of HER2 (Supplemental Figure
19); the results strongly recapitulated findings from the RPPA and mRNA-subtypes
including a high correlation between HER2 clinical status, HER2 protein by RPPA, pHER2, HER1, and p-HER1. These multiple signatures, namely HER2E-mRNA-subtype,
HER2-amplicon genes by mRNA expression, and RPPA HER1/p-HER1/HER2/p-HER2
signature, ultimately identify at least two groups/subtypes within clinically HER2+ tumors
(Table 1). These signatures represent breast cancer biomarker(s) that could potentially
predict response to anti-HER2 targeted therapies.

Author Manuscript

Many therapeutic advances have been made for clinically HER2-positive disease. This study
has identified additional somatic mutations that represent potential therapeutic targets within
this group, including a high frequency of PIK3CA mutations (39%), a lower frequency of
PTEN and PIK3R1 mutations (Supplemental Table 6), and genomic losses of PTEN and
INPP4B. Other possible druggable mutations included variants within HER-family members
including two somatic mutations in HER2, two within HER1/EGFR, and five within HER3.
Pertuzumab, in combination with trastuzumab, targets the HER2-HER3 heterodimer48,
however, these data suggest that targeting HER1 with HER2 could also be beneficial.
Lastly, the HER2E-mRNA-subtype typically showed high aneuploidy, the highest somatic
mutation rate (Table 1), and DNA amplification of other potential therapeutic targets
including FGFRs, HER1/EGFR, CDK4 and Cyclin D1.

Basal-like summary analysis

Author Manuscript

The Basal-like subtype was discovered more than a decade ago by first-generation cDNA
microarrays13. These tumors are often referred to as Triple-Negative Breast Cancers
(TNBC) because most Basal-like tumors are typically negative for ER, PR and HER2.
However, ~75% of TNBC are Basal-like with the other 25% comprised of all other mRNAsubtypes6. In this data set, there was a high degree of overlap between these two distinctions
with 76 TNBC, 81 Basal-like, and 65 that were both TNBC and Basal-like. Given the
known heterogeneity of TNBC, and that the Basal-like subtype proved to be distinct on
every platform, we choose to use the Basal-like distinction for comparative analyses.

Author Manuscript

Basal-like tumors showed a high frequency of TP53 mutations (80%)9, which when
combined with inferred TP53 pathway activity suggests that loss of TP53 function occurs
within most, if not all, Basal-like cancers (Figure 3B). In addition to loss of TP53, a MEMo
analysis reconfirmed that loss of RB1 and BRCA1 are Basal-like features (Figure 4C)46,49.
PIK3CA was the next most commonly mutated gene (~9%); however, inferred PI3K
pathway activity, whether from gene36–38, protein35, or high PI3K/AKT pathway activities,
was highest in Basal-like cancers (Figure 3A). Alternative means of activating the PI3Kpathway in Basal-like cancers likely includes loss of PTEN and INPP4B and/or
amplification of PIK3CA. A recent paper from Shah et al.12 performed exome sequencing of
102 TNBC. Five of the top six most frequent TNBCs mutations in Shah et al. were also
observed at a similar frequency in our TNBC subset (Myo3A not present here); of those
five, three passed our test as a significantly mutated gene in TNBCs (Supplemental Table 2).

Expression features of Basal-like tumors include a characteristic signature containing
Keratins 5, 6 and 17 and high expression of genes associated with cell proliferation
(Supplemental Figure 5). A PARADIGM32 analysis of Basal-like versus Luminal tumors
emphasized the importance of hyperactivated FOXM1 as a transcriptional driver of this
enhanced proliferation signature (Supplemental Figure 17). PARADIGM also identified
hyperactivated cMYC and HIF1α/ARNT network hubs as key regulatory features of Basallike cancers. Even though chromosome 8q24 is amplified across all subtypes (Supplemental
Figure 9), high cMYC activation appears to be a Basal-like characteristic50.

Given the striking contrasts between Basal-like and Luminal/HER2E subtypes, we
performed a MEMo analysis on Basal-like tumors alone. The top-scoring module included
ATM mutations, BRCA1 and BRCA2 inactivation, RB1 loss and Cyclin E1 amplification
(Figure 4C). Interestingly, these same modules were identified previously for Serous
Ovarian cancers40. Furthermore, the Basal-like (and TNBC) mutation spectrum was
reminiscent of the spectrum seen in Serous Ovarian cancers51 with only one gene (i.e. TP53)
at >10% mutation frequency. To explore possible similarities between Serous Ovarian and
the breast Basal-like cancers, we performed a number of analyses comparing Ovarian vs.
breast Luminal, Ovarian vs. breast Basal-like, and breast Basal-like vs. breast Luminal
(Figure 5). Comparing copy number landscapes, we observed several common features
between Ovarian and Basal-like tumors including widespread genomic instability and
common gains of 1q, 3q, 8q and 12p, and loss of 4q, 5q and 8p (Supplemental Figure 20A).
Using a more global copy number comparison, we examined the overall fraction of the
genome altered and the overall copy number correlation of Ovarian cancers versus each
breast cancer mRNA-subtype (Supplemental Figure 20A, B); in both cases, Basal-like
tumors were the most similar to the Serous Ovarian carcinomas.

We systematically looked for other common features between Serous Ovarian and Basallike when each was compared to Luminal. We identified: 1) BRCA1 inactivation, 2) RB1
loss and Cyclin E1 amplification, 3) high expression of AKT3, 4) cMYC amplification and
high expression, and 5) a high frequency of TP53 mutations (Figure 5A). An additional
supervised analysis of a large, external multi-tumor type transcriptomic dataset (GSE2109)
was performed where each TCGA breast tumor expression profile was compared via a
correlation analysis to that of each tumor in the multi-tumor set. Basal-like breast cancers
clearly showed high mRNA expression correlations with Serous Ovarian cancers, as well as
with Lung Squamous carcinomas (Figure 5B). A PARADIGM analysis that calculates
whether a gene or pathway feature is both differentially activated in Basal-like versus
Luminal cancers and has higher overall activity across the TCGA Ovarian samples was
performed; this identified comparably high pathway activity of the HIF1α/ARNT, cMYC,
and FOXM1 regulatory hubs in both Ovarian and Basal-like cancers (Supplemental Figure
20C). The common findings of TP53, RB1 and BRCA1 loss, with cMYC amplification
strongly suggest that these are shared driving events for Basal-like and Serous Ovarian
carcinogenesis. This suggests that common therapeutic approaches should be considered,
which is supported by the activity of platinum analogs, and taxanes, in breast Basal-like and
Serous Ovarian cancers.

Given that most Basal-like cancers are TNBC, finding new drug targets for this group is
critical. Unfortunately, the somatic mutation repertoire for Basal-like breast cancers has not
provided a common target aside from BRCA1 and BRCA2. Here we note that ~20% of
Basal-like tumors had a germline (n=12) and/or somatic (n=8) BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant,
which suggests 1 in 5 Basal-like patients might benefit from PARP inhibitors and/or
platinum compounds52,53. The copy number landscape of Basal-like cancers showed
multiple amplifications and deletions, some of which may provide therapeutic targets
(Supplemental Table 6). Potential targets include losses of PTEN and INPP4B, both of
which have been shown to sensitize cell lines to PI3K pathway inhibitors54,55. Interestingly,
many of the components of the PI3K and RAS-RAF-MEK pathway were amplified (but not
typically mutated) in Basal-like cancers including PIK3CA (49%), KRAS (32%), BRAF
(30%), and HER1/EGFR (23%). Other RTKs that are plausible drug targets and amplified in
some Basal-like cancers include FGFR1, FGFR2, IGFR1, c-KIT, MET and PDGFRA.
Lastly, the PARADIGM identification of high HIF1α/ARNT pathway activity suggest that
these malignancies might be susceptible to angiogenesis inhibitors and/or bioreductive drugs
that become activated under hypoxic conditions.

Summary

Author Manuscript

The integrated molecular analyses of breast carcinomas we report significantly extends our
knowledge base to produce a comprehensive catalog of likely genomic drivers of the most
common breast cancer subtypes (Table 1). Our novel observation that diverse genetic and
epigenetic alterations converge phenotypically into four main breast cancer classes is not
only consistent with convergent evolution of gene circuits as seen across multiple
organisms, but also with models of breast cancer clonal expansion and in vivo cell selection
proposed to explain the phenotypic heterogeneity observed within defined breast cancer
subtypes.

Methods summary

Author Manuscript

Specimens were obtained from patients with appropriate consent from institutional review
boards. Using a co-isolation protocol, DNA and RNA were purified. In total, 800 patients
were assayed on at least one platform. Different numbers of patients were used for each
platform using the largest number of patients available at time of data freeze; 466 samples
(463 patients) were in common across 5/6 platforms (excluding RPPA) and 348 patients
were in common on 6/6 platforms. Technology platforms used include: 1) gene expression
DNA microarrays51, 2) DNA methylation arrays, 3) microRNA sequencing, 4) Affymetrix
SNP arrays, 5) exome sequencing, and 6) Reverse Phase Protein Arrays. Each platform,
except for the exome sequencing, was used in a de novo subtype discovery analysis
(Supplemental Methods) which were included in a single analysis to define an overall
subtype architecture. Additional integrated across platform computational analyses were
preformed including PARADIGM32 and MEMo40.

Figure 1. Significantly Mutated Genes (SMG) and correlations with genomic and clinical
features

Author Manuscript

Tumor samples are grouped by mRNA-subtype: Luminal A (n=225), Luminal B (n=126),
HER2E (n=57), and Basal-like (n=93). Left: Non-silent somatic mutation patterns and
frequencies for SMGs. Middle: Clinical features: black, positive or T2-4; white, negative or
T1; grey, NA or equivocal. Right: SMGs with frequent copy number amplifications (red) or
deletions (blue). Far Right: Non-silent mutation rate per tumor (mutations per megabase,
adjusted for coverage). Average mutation rate for each expression subtype is indicated.
Hypermutated: mutation rates > 3 SD above the mean (> 4.688, indicated by grey line).

Figure 3. Integrated analysis of the PI3K, TP53, and RB1 pathways

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer subtypes differ by genetic and genomic targeting events, with corresponding
effects on pathway activity. For a) PI3K, b) TP53 and c) RB1 pathways, key genes were
selected using prior biological knowledge. Multiple mRNA expression signatures for a
given pathway were defined (details in Supplemental Methods; PI3K:Saal, PTEN loss in
human breast tumors; PI3K:CMap, PI3K/mTOR inhibitor treatment in vitro;
PI3K:Majumder, Akt over-expression in mouse model; p53:IARC, expert-curated p53
targets; p53:GSK, TP53 mutant versus wild-type cell lines; p53:KANNAN, p53 overexpression in vitro; p53:TROESTER, TP53 knockdown in vitro; Rb:CHICAS, RB1 mouse
knockout versus wild-type; Rb:LARA, RB1 knockdown in vitro; Rb:HERSCHKOWITZ, RB1
LOH in human breast tumors) and applied to the gene expression data, in order to score each
tumor for relative signature activity (yellow: more active). The PI3K panel includes a
protein-based (RPPA) proteomic signature. Tumors were ordered first by mRNA-subtype,
though specific ordering differs between the panels. P-values were calculated by a Pearson’s
correlation or a Chi-squared test.

Figure 4. Mutual Exclusivity Modules in Cancer (MEMo) analysis

Mutual exclusivity modules are represented by their gene components and connected to
reflect their activity in distinct pathways. For each gene, the frequency of alteration in Basallike (right box) and non-Basal (left box) is reported. Next to each module is a fingerprint
indicating what specific alteration is observed for each gene (row) in each sample (column).
a) MEMo identified several overlapping modules that recapitulate the RTK/PI3K and p38/
JNK1 signaling pathways and whose core was the top-scoring module. b) MEMo identified
alterations to TP53 signaling as occurring within a statistically significant mutually
exclusive trend. c) A Basal-like only MEMo analysis identified one module that included
ATM mutations, defects at BRCA1 and BRCA2, and deregulation of the RB1-pathway. A
gene expression heatmap is below the fingerprint to show expression levels.
