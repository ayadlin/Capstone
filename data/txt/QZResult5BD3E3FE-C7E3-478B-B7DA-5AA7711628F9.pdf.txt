BACKGROUND: Cyclin D1 expression has been reported in a subset of patients with diffuse large B-cell leukemia (DLBCL), but studies
have been few and generally small, and they have demonstrated no obvious clinical implications attributable to cyclin D1 expression.
METHODS: The authors reviewed 1435 patients who were diagnosed with DLBCL as part of the International DLBCL rituximab with
cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) Consortium Program and performed clinical, immunohistochemical, and genetic analyses with a focus on cyclin D1. All patients who were cyclin D1-positive according to immunohistochemistry were also assessed for rearrangements of the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Gene
expression profiling was performed to compare patients who had DLBCL with and without cyclin D1 expression. RESULTS: In total, 30
patients (2.1%) who had DLBCL that expressed cyclin D1 and lacked CCND1 gene rearrangements were identified. Patients with cyclin
D1-positive DLBCL had a median age of 57 years (range, 16.0-82.6 years). There were 23 males and 7 females. Twelve patients (40%)
had bulky disease. None of them expressed CD5. Two patients expressed cyclin D2. Gene expression profiling indicated that 17 tumors
were of the germinal center type, and 13 were of the activated B-cell type. Genetic aberrations of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2
(BCL2), BCL6, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), mouse double minute 2 oncogene E3 ubiquitin protein
ligase (MDM2), MDM4, and tumor protein 53 (TP53) were rare or absent. Gene expression profiling did not reveal any striking differences with respect to cyclin D1 in DLBCL. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients who had cyclin D1-negative DLBCL, men were more
commonly affected with cyclin D1-positive DLBCL, and they were significantly younger. There were no other significant differences in
clinical presentation, pathologic features, overall survival, or progression-free survival between these two subgroups of patients with

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of B-cell lymphoma in the world.1 DLBCL, as currently defined, is a heterogeneous group of diseases with many morphologic and immunophenotypic variants and molecular subtypes.2 The standard therapy for patients with DLBCL is rituximab with cyclophosphamide,
hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP); and the 10-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates are 43.5% and 36.5%, respectively.3

DLBCL With Cyclin D1 Expression/Ok et al

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents 4% to 10%
of B-cell lymphomas worldwide and is characterized by
t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in immunoglobulin heavy locus/
cyclin D1 (IGH/CCND1) fusion, which results in marked
over-expression of the cyclin D1 protein.4 MCL is an aggressive lymphoma, and affected patients respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy. MCL can exhibit a wide range of
morphologic appearances. A blastoid form occurs in up to
10% of patients, and another histological form, the pleomorphic variant, exhibits morphologic overlap with DLBCL.
Distinguishing pleomorphic variant MCL from DLBCL is
important because R-CHOP therapy is considered inadequate for patients with MCL; and, in some institutions
(including ours), patients with MCL most often receive treatment with a dose-intensified regimen: rituximab combined
with fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (R-hyper-CVAD) alternating with
rituximab in combination with high-dose methotrexatecytarabine (R-MA).5
Previous studies have demonstrated that a subset of
patients with DLBCL overexpress cyclin D1 at the immunohistochemical level, and this expression occurs independently of the t(11;14).6-11 There have been only few case
reports and case series of cyclin D1 expression in DLBCL.
The objectives of the current study were: 1) to determine
the frequency of cyclin D1 expression in a large cohort of
patients with DLBCL; 2) to comprehensively characterize
patients who have DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression; and
3) to estimate of the frequency with which pleomorphic
MCL might be misdiagnosed as DLBCL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

In total, 1435 patients with de novo DLBCL were evaluated. All patients were a part of the International
DLBCL Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program12-15
and were diagnosed according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria. Exclusion criteria were
transformation from low-grade B-cell lymphoma and
immunodeficiency-associated cases, especially human immunodeficiency virus infection. This study was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. The overall collaborative study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.12-15
Tissue Microarray and Immunohistochemistry

Hematoxylin-eosin stained slides from each of the 1435
patients with DLBCL were reviewed, and tumor-rich

areas were selected. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using a tissue microarrayer (Beecher Instrument,
Silver Spring, Md). Immunohistochemical analyses were
performed on 4-lm TMA sections using a streptavidinbiotin complex technique with antibodies that were reactive for the following antigens: cluster of differentiation 5
(CD5; a type I transmembrane protein), CD10 (a type II
transmembrane protein), CD30 (a type I transmembrane
protein), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), BCL-6,
cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, forkhead box P1
(FOXP1), germinal center B-cell–expressed transcript 1
(GCET1), multiple myeloma antigen 1 (MUM1), and
nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) pathway components protein
65 (p65), p50, p52, and c-Rel (a protein encoded by the
REL gene); and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) in all cases. Because
of tissue exhaustion, staining was not always available for
each marker. Antigen expression was scored in 10% increments by assessing the percentage of immunoreactive tumor cells. A cutoff value for each marker was established
using an analysis of receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves and/or X-Tile analysis to achieve maximum
specificity and sensitivity as described previously.13 The
cutoff scores for these markers were established as follows:
20% for CD30, 30% for CD10 and BCL-6; 50% for
cyclin D2 and cyclin D3; 60% for GCET1, MUM1, and
FOXP1; and 70% for BCL-2. When an optimal cutoff
value could not be determined by ROC curve and/or XTile analyses, cutoff values were established based on a literature review, which indicate cutoff scores of 20% for
CD516 and 30% for pSTAT3.17 Any nuclear expression
of cyclin D1 and each NF-jB component was considered
positive. We also performed cyclin D1 and CD20 double
staining in selected cases.
Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization for CCND1,
BCL2, BCL6, MYC, MDM2, MDM4, and TP53
Sequencing

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed
on paraffin-embedded tissue sections with a locus-specific
CCND1 dual-color, break-apart probe (Vysis, Downers
Grove, Ill); BCL2 and BCL6 dual-color, break-apart
probes (Vysis); v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) locus-specific IGH/MYC/chromosome enumeration probe 8 (CEP8) tricolor, dual-fusion
probes; a locus-specific MYC dual-color, break-apart
probe (Vysis); and mouse double minute 2 oncogene E3
ubiquitin protein ligase (MDM2) and MDM4 probes as
described previously.13,15 Tissues on the TMA were considered for evaluation if at least 200 tumor cell nuclei per
1819

core displayed positive signals. Abnormal FISH signals
were recorded as the percentage of cells that had an abnormality. Tumor protein 53 (TP53) exon sequencing with a
p53 AmpliChip (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton,
Calif) was performed in 618 patients as previously
described.12
Cell-of-Origin Classification

Cell-of-origin (COO) classification was established by
combining data from gene expression profiling (GEP),
which is considered the “gold standard,” and immunohistochemistry (IHC) data. RNA was extracted from each of
583 sections using the HighPure RNA Extraction Kit
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind) and was subjected to GEP as previously described.12,13,15 COO classification could be determined in 528 cases by GEP. When
COO was not classifiable with GEP, it was determined by
IHC according to the Visco-Young and Choi algorithms.13,18 The correlation between GEP and IHC for
COO classification was 86% overall.
Response Definitions and Statistical Analysis

Clinical and laboratory features were compared using the
Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the MannWhitney U test for continuous variables. OS and PFS
were calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of
last follow-up or death and from the date of diagnosis to
the date of progression or death, respectively. KaplanMeier survival curves were used to estimate OS, and the
log-rank test was used to assess differences in survival
between groups. All differences with P values < .05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics

There were 821 males and 614 females (male to female ratio, 1.3:1), and the median patient age was 62.9 years
(range, 3.4-96.0 years). B-symptoms were present in
35.6% of patients. Approximately half of the patients had
advanced Ann Arbor stage disease (51.3%), or had an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (49.4%), or had
both. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was considered good (performance status
<2) in 78.1% of patients. The International Prognostic
Index was low or low-intermediate (<3) in 63% of
patients. Two or more extranodal sites were involved in
23.2% of patients, and bulky tumor (6 cm) was identified in 44.4% of patients. In total, 964 patients received
R-CHOP or an R-CHOP-like regimen, and 348 patients
received CHOP or a CHOP-like regimen. Twenty-one
1820

patients received other regimens, such as doxorubicin,
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) or fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD). No information regarding treatment was available for 102 patients. Overall, 750
(52.3%) and 645 (44.9%) DLBCLs were classified as the
germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC)
subtypes, respectively. Forty tumors (2.8%) did not have
sufficient data for classification either because GEP was
not performed or because of tissue exhaustion.
Cyclin D1 Is Expressed in a Subset of DLBCL

Cyclin D1 protein was expressed in 30 patients (2.1%).
These patients had a median age of 57 years (range, 16.082.6 years) (Table 1). There were 23 males and 7 females.
Lymph nodes were involved in 17 patients, the spleen was
involved in 1 patient, and various extranodal sites were
involved in 12 patients, including small intestine, humerus, vertebra, submandibular glands, and breast. Ten
patients had small disease (<6 cm), and 12 patients had
bulky disease (6 cm). Size was unknown in 8 patients.
Histologically, 23 DLBCLs were the centroblastic variant,
3 were immunoblastic, and 4 were anaplastic (Table 2,
Fig. 1). None of these tumors were positive for CD5. Two
tumors were positive for cyclin D2, and all tumors were
negative for cyclin D3. Eleven tumors (36.7%) were positive for p50, 8 tumors (26.7%) were positive for p52, 7
tumors (23.3%) were positive for pSTAT3, 4 tumors
(13.3%) were positive for p65, and 3 tumors (10%) were
positive for c-Rel.
GEP demonstrated that 17 tumors were GCB and
13 were ABC. FISH detected CCND1 amplification in 3
tumors. CCND1 abnormalities were not detected by
FISH in 25 tumors. The remaining 2 tumors did not have
a sufficient amount of tissue for analysis. FISH for other
genes identified 1 of 30 tumors with BCL2 rearrangement, 4 of 27 tumors with BCL6 rearrangement, 2 of 22
tumors with MYC translocations, and no abnormalities
involving MDM2 (n 5 19) or MDM4 (n 5 18). Two
tumors had TP53 mutation: 1 had an A to G substitution
at codon 246 in exon 7, resulting in a methionine to valine
replacement; and the other had a G to A substitution at
codon 245 in exon 7 of the TP53 gene, resulting in glycine to serine replacement in the protein. Both mutations
were missense mutations, resulting in loss of function of
the p53 protein. One case with TP53 mutation also had
an MYC translocation. Treatment data were available for
29 patients with cyclin D1-positive DLBCL (Table 1).
Twenty of these patients received R-CHOP and the other
9 patients received CHOP. In the former group, 6

FISH-Identified Rare, Probable, Pleomorphic
MCL

From the original study group (n 5 1435), 6 patients had
cyclin D1 expression, and FISH revealed CCND1 rearrangements, supporting reclassification as MCL of the
pleomorphic variant. The median age of these 6 patients
was 66.4 years (range, 53.0-85.0 years), and they included
4 women and 2 men. Three patients had involved lymph
nodes, and 2 had involved extranodal sites. The disease

site was not available for 1 patient. Two patients had
bulky disease (6 cm), 2 patients had small lymph nodes
(< 6 cm), and size was not available for 2 patients.
Histologically, the pleomorphic MCLs could not be
distinguished from the DLBCLs. All tumors had diffuse
proliferation of large, atypical, lymphoid cells with
round-to-oval nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, 2 or
3 membrane-bound nucleoli, and a moderate amount of
cytoplasm intermixed with scattered immunoblasts, mimicking the centroblastic variant of DLBCL (Fig. 2). All
pleomorphic MCLs overexpressed cyclin D1 in at least
60% of tumor cells, in which cyclin D2 and cyclin D3
were negative. All tumors were positive for CD5. Two
tumors were positive for p52; and p50, p65, c-Rel, and
pSTAT3 were positive in 1 tumor each. There were no
abnormalities in BCL2 (n 5 6), BCL6 (n 5 6), MYC

a nonsense mutation. The C to T substitution at codon
192 in exon 6 (Q192X) resulted in a stop codon.
Four patients received treatment with R-CHOP, and
2 received treatment with CHOP. Five patients passed
away and 1 patient remained alive at the last follow-up.
Cyclin D1-Positive DLBCL Versus Cyclin
D1-Negative DLBCL

We compared the patients who had cyclin D1-positive
DLBCL with those who had cyclin D1-negative DLBCL
(Table 3). When age was analyzed as a continuous variable, patients with cyclin D1-positive DLBCL were significantly younger than those with cyclin D1-negative
DLBCL (median age, 57 years vs 63 years, respectively;

P 5 .022). This trend was reproduced when age was analyzed as a categorical variable (age 60 years vs <60
years; P 5 .004). Men were more commonly affected by
cyclin D1-positive DLBCL (P 5 .039). All other clinical
findings, including COO classification, CD5 expression,
NF-jB components, and pSTAT3 status, were similar in
the 2 groups. GEP identified 22 genes, including
CCND1, that were up-regulated in patients who had
DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression compared with those
who had DLBCL without cyclin D1 expression (Fig.
3A). Some of the other substantially up-regulated genes
were solute family carrier 2A member 4 regulator

However, striking differences in GEP between the 2
groups were not observed. Compared with patients who
had DLBCL without cyclin D1 expression, patients who
had cyclin D1-positive DLBCL had similar OS and PFS
(P 5 .788 and P 5 .847, respectively) (Fig. 4). Separating
out the GCB type from the ABC type, patients with
cyclin D1-positive DLBCL and cyclin D1-negative
DLBCL had similar OS and PFS in the GCB group
(P 5 .969 and P 5 .999, respectively) and the ABC
group (P 5 .788 and P 5 .914), respectively.
Cyclin D1-Positive DLBCL Versus Pleomorphic
MCL

When we compared patients who had cyclin D1-positive
DLBCL with patients who had pleomorphic MCL, all
clinical characteristics, COO classification, the Ki-67 proliferation rate, the expression of NF-jB components, and
pSTAT3 expression did not differ significantly (P > .05)
(Table 4). However, CD5 was expressed in all patients
with pleomorphic MCL but not in patients with cyclin

D1-positive DLBCL (P < .001). The median proportion
of cyclin D1-stained cells also was much higher in patients
who had pleomorphic MCL versus those with cyclin D1positive DLBCL (85% vs 30%, respectively; P < .001).
OS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups after
separating the subgroups who received R-CHOP and
CHOP (P 5 .464 and P 5 .778, respectively). Genetic
aberrations regarding BCL2, BCL6, MYC, MDM2, and
MDM4 were rare in both groups. GEP revealed a striking
distinction between DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression
and pleomorphic MCL (Fig. 3B). In total, 66 genes were
differently expressed between the 2 groups: 19 genes were
up-regulated and 47 genes were down-regulated in
DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression compared with pleomorphic MCL. Most down-regulated genes in DLBCL
with cyclin D1 expression were genes related to ubiquitination (ubiquitin-protein ligase E3C [UBE3C], DNA

ZNF616, ZNF85, activity-dependent neuroprotective
protein [ADNP], mediator complex subunit 13-like
[MED13L], and solute family carrier 30 [zinc transporter]
member 9 [SLC30A9]).
Mutations in TP53 were rare in both groups. The
nonsense mutation identified in 1 pleomorphic MCL was
a very rare event in hematolymphoid neoplasms. Three
patients with pQ192* mutations in TP53 have been
documented in the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database, comprising 0.18% (3 of
1677 tumors) of all deposited hematopoietic neoplasms.
Functional information (sorting intolerant from tolerant
[SIFT] class) is not available for this mutation. According
to the IARC TP53 Database, the 2 missense mutations in
DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression also are rarely observed
in hematolymphoid neoplasms, comprising 25 of 1677
(1.5%) G245S mutations and 12 of 1677 (0.72%)
M246V mutations. However, both mutations are functionally deleterious according to their SIFT class.
DISCUSSION
Although the overexpression of cyclin D1 is characteristically observed at high levels in MCL, cyclin D1 expression
can also be observed in a subset of other lymphoid tumors,
including hairy cell leukemia (approximately 50%) and
plasma cell myeloma (approximately 33%), and uncommonly in DLBCL.19,20 Other investigators have reported
cyclin D1-positive DLBCL mostly as part of case reports
and small case series.6-8,10,21,22 The reported frequency in
most studies has ranged from 1.5% to 4.3%. One study
reported that 15% of DLBCLs expressed cyclin D1, but
that study seems to be an outlier.6 In the current study, in
accordance with earlier studies, 30 of 1429 (2.1%) de
novo DLBCLs overexpressed cyclin D1.
Prior data on DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression
indicated that these tumors are more often of a non-GCB
type based on the Hans algorithm.6,8,23 Our data contradict this previous conclusion, because more tumors (17 of
30 DLBCLs; 56.7%) were of the GCB type. One explanation for the contradiction may be that GEP was used for
COO classification in our study, in contrast to previous
reports in which the Hans algorithm was used. It is noteworthy that the Hans algorithm has reported 71% and
88% concordance with the GCB and ABC types, respectively, by GEP classification of DLBCL.20 Our cohort
was far larger (n 5 1429) than those from prior studies by
Ehinger et al (n 5 231)8 and Vela-Chavez et al (n 5 66)6
and, thus, also may be more representative.

Figure 3. Gene expression profiling is shown. (A) Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is shown with and without cyclin D1
expression. (B) Pleomorphic mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and DLBCL are shown with cyclin D1 expression.

Three patients with cyclin D1-positive DLBCL had
CCND1 amplification, which is the likely explanation for
cyclin D1 overexpression in these 3 tumors. This is similar
to the situation in plasma cell myeloma, in which extra
copies of chromosome 11 explain cyclin D1 expression in
a subset of DLBCLs.20 The explanation for cyclin D1
overexpression in the remaining 26 cyclin D1-positive
DLBCLs is unclear. Except for the occurrence in relatively
younger men, cyclin D1 expression in DLBCL does not
confer difference in clinical manifestations, immunophenotype, genetic aberrations, or survival compared with
DLBCL without cyclin D1 expression. The reason for the
difference in age and sex in patients who have DLBCL
with cyclin D1 expression is not clear.
It is known that NF-jB, a signaling pathway
involved in cell growth and development, is constitutively
activated in ABC-type DLBCL as well as MCL.24,25
STAT3 regulates many cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and angiogenesis. Constitutive activation of STAT3 also has been observed in ABCtype DLBCL and in 70% of leukemic MCL.26,27
Recently, inhibitors of NF-jB and STAT3 have been
actively studied as a new approach to cancer therapy. For
these reasons, we evaluated the expression of NF-jB components (p50, p52, p65, and c-Rel) and pSTAT3 in
patients who had DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression. The
expression of NF-jB components was observed more
commonly in DLBCL with cyclin D1 expression versus
1826

pleomorphic MCL. It is interesting that the expression of
pSTAT3 was detectable in 7 of 25 (28%) cyclin D1positive DLBCLs, and 5 of those tumors were of the GCB
type. The reason for pSTAT3 expression in GCB-type
DLBCL is unclear, and further studies are warranted for
clarification.
We identified 6 tumors originally classified as
DLBCL that were cyclin D1-positive and carried CCND1
rearrangement as part of the current study. These tumors
were reclassified as probable pleomorphic MCL according
to the current WHO classification. It is noteworthy that
GEP of pleomorphic MCL in our study differed somewhat from that of classic MCL reported by Fu et al,28 who
demonstrated that 28 genes were significantly upregulated in classic MCL. We included 24 of the 28 genes
reported by Fu et al in our GEP study. Compared with
DLBCL, only 1 gene, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase
(ALOX5), was significantly up-regulated; 17 genes were
relatively up-regulated without statistical significance; 2
genes had inconsistent regulation patterns; and 4 genes
were down-regulated in pleomorphic MCL. The discrepancy in GEP raises the issue of exact classification when
FISH is used to separate MCL from DLBCL. Juskevicius
et al, in a recently published case report of DLBCL with
CCND1 rearrangements, reported that the exact classification may be a matter of debate.29 However, according
to the current WHO classification, these tumors are better
designated as bona fide MCL.

Our data suggest that pleomorphic MCL is misdiagnosed as DLBCL in a small subset of patients, representing 6 of 1435 patients (0.42%) in the current study. The
clinical characteristics of affected patients and morphologic features of the neoplasms were very similar between
the cyclin D1-positive DLBCL and pleomorphic MCL
groups. One helpful finding was CD5 expression, which
was observed in all 6 patients with pleomorphic MCL. In
addition, cyclin D1 expression was observed in higher
proportions of tumor cells in pleomorphic MCL (median,
85%) than in DLBCL (median, 30%). Very little genetic
information (other than conventional cytogenetic data) is
available for pleomorphic MCL. Our study demonstrated
that genetic aberrations involving BCL2, BCL6, MYC,
MDM2, and MDM4 are rare in pleomorphic MCL. The
TP53 mutation (Q192*) is also rarely observed in any
hematolymphoid neoplasm, and this mutation appears to
be a random event.
In summary, a small subset (2.1%) of patients with
DLBCL overexpresses cyclin D1. Patients with cyclin D1positive DLBCL tend to be younger men but otherwise
are not clinically significantly different from patients with
cyclin D1-negative DLBCL. Unlike earlier studies, over
half of the cyclin D1-positive DLBCL patients in the current study had the GCB type. FISH studies revealed a low
frequency or absence of translocations involving BCL2,
BCL6, MYC, MDM2, and MDM4 as well as a low frequency of TP53 mutations in patients with cyclin D1positive DLBCL. The distinction of cyclin D1-positive
DLBCL from MCL is critical because of important differences in prognosis and therapy.
