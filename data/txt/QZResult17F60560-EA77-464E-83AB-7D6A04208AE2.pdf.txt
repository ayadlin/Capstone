Abstract
The intracellular tyrosine kinase protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) lacks a membrane-targeting SH4 domain and
localizes to the nuclei of normal prostate epithelial cells. However, PTK6 translocates from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm in human prostate tumor cells. Here, we show that while PTK6 is located primarily within the
cytoplasm, the pool of active PTK6 in prostate cancer cells localizes to membranes. Ectopic expression of
membrane-targeted active PTK6 promoted epithelial–mesenchymal transition in part by enhancing activation of
AKT, thereby stimulating cancer cell migration and metastases in xenograft models of prostate cancer.
Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous PTK6 promoted an epithelial phenotype and impaired
tumor xenograft growth. In mice, PTEN deﬁciency caused endogenous active PTK6 to localize at membranes in
association with decreased E-cadherin expression. Active PTK6 was detected at membranes in some high-grade
human prostate tumors, and PTK6 and E-cadherin expression levels were inversely correlated in human prostate
cancers. In addition, high levels of PTK6 expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer. Our
ﬁndings reveal novel functions for PTK6 in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer, and they deﬁne this kinase as a
candidate therapeutic target. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5426–37. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and
second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men
(1). Most prostate cancer-related deaths are due to advanced
metastatic disease, resulting from lymphatic, blood, or contiguous local spread. Tumors of the prostate originate from
epithelial cells and there is a clinical correlation between the
degree of differentiation and clinical outcomes.
Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6, also known as BRK or Sik) is
a SRC-related intracellular tyrosine kinase that is expressed in
epithelial cells. Unlike SRC-family members, PTK6 lacks an
amino-terminal SH4 domain that promotes lipid modiﬁcation
and membrane association (2). Absence of palmitoylation
and/or myristoylation facilitates ﬂexibility in its intracellular
localization. The intracellular localization of PTK6 may have a
profound impact on signaling, due to its differential access to
substrates and associated proteins in different cellular compartments (3–5). Currently, the prostate provides the only
known physiologically relevant example of PTK6 relocalization

in vivo. PTK6 is primarily nuclear in epithelial cells of the normal
human prostate, but nuclear localization is lost in prostate
cancer (6). Cytoplasmic retention of PTK6 promoted growth of
the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, whereas expression of nucleartargeted PTK6 signiﬁcantly decreased cell proliferation (7).
Expression of PTK6 is elevated in several epithelial-derived
cancers such as breast, colon, head and neck, melanoma,
and ovarian cancer (reviewed in refs. 8, 9). Increased levels of
PTK6 mRNA were detected in metastatic human prostate
cancer samples, suggesting a role for PTK6 in prostate tumor
metastasis (5). PTK6 promotes cancer cell proliferation,
migration, and survival through activating oncogenic signaling pathways involving AKT, Paxillin, p190RhoGAP, p130CAS,
STAT3, STAT5b, EGF receptor (EGFR), HER2, MET, and
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR; reviewed in
refs. 8, 9). PTK6 directly phosphorylates and promotes AKT
activation in response to EGF in BPH1 cells (10). It directly
phosphorylates the CRK-associated substrate p130CAS, leading to formation of peripheral adhesion complexes and
enhanced cell migration in PC3 cells (5). Recently, PTK6 was
also shown to phosphorylate and activate focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) to promote resistance to anoikis (11).
Elevated expression and/or activation of tyrosine kinases are
often associated with the epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT), in which loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and
elevation of the mesenchymal marker vimentin are observed
(12). Activated SRC induces disorganization of E-cadherin–
dependent cell–cell contacts and vimentin expression in the
KM12C colon cancer cell line. Deregulation of E-cadherin and
formation of peripheral adhesions induced by active SRC kinase

Oncogenic Functions for PTK6 at the Membrane

relies on integrin, FAK, and extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK)1/2 signaling cascades (13, 14). Recent studies indicate
that the EMT of tumor cells is also coupled with increased cell
survival and drug resistance (reviewed in ref. 15).
We report endogenous PTK6 activation at the membrane in
prostate epithelial cell lines, Pten-null mice, and human prostate tumors. We found that membrane-targeted active PTK6
causes a cell-scattering phenotype in PC3 cells and promotes
the EMT, cell migration, and invasion. This is achieved at least
partially through increased activation of AKT. Knockdown of
PTK6 in PC3 cells promotes an epithelial phenotype and
dramatically reduces metastases in vivo. In contrast, activation
of PTK6 at the plasma membrane is associated with deregulation of E-cadherin in mouse and human prostates. High levels
of PTK6 also predict a poor prognosis for patients. Our studies
show a novel role for PTK6 in the EMT and suggest that PTK6
can be a target for treating metastatic prostate cancer.

secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and detected
by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Dura extended
duration substrate from Pierce.
Plasmids and siRNAs
The Myc-tagged Palm-PTK6-YF construct in the pBABEpuro vector has been described previously (10). The siRNAs
(Dharmacon) targeting p130CAS: 50 -GGTCGACAGTGGTGTGTAT-30 (5) and AKT: 50 -TGCCCTTCTACAACCAGGATT-30 (16)
were previously reported. Dicer-substrate siRNAs against
PTK6 were purchased from the Integrated DNA Technologies
predesigned DsiRNA library. The sequence for Dsi-PTK6 is 50 AGGTTCACAAATGTGGAGTGTCTGC-30 .
Cell culture and fractionation
The human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 [American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC); CRL-1435] and DU145 (ATCC;
HTB-81) were certiﬁed by ATCC and cultured according to
the ATCC guidelines. The benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell line BPH-1 (kindly provided by Simon Hayward, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; ref. 17) was cultured in RPMI1640 containing 5% FBS. No additional authentication of cell
lines was conducted. Cell fractionations were carried out using

www.aacrjournals.org

the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction Kit (EMD
Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
method used for preparation of total cell lysates has been
described previously (10).
Retrovirus production and transduction
pBABE-puro plasmids were transfected into PhoenixAmpho cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Retrovirus
was collected 48 and 72 hours later. PC3 and BPH1 cells were
infected with retrovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
100 for 24 hours. Stable cell pools were selected in growth
medium containing 2 mg/mL puromycin for 1 week.
Primers and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
After DNase I digestion (Promega), 500 ng of RNA was used to
generate cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time
(RT)-PCR was conducted using the following mixture: 1 iQ
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 100 nmol/L of each primers,
and 1 mL of cDNA in a 25 mL total volume. Reactions were
ampliﬁed and analyzed in triplicate using a MyiQ single-color
RT-PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The following primers
were used: human cyclophilin: (forward) 50 -GCAGACAAGGTCCCAAAGACAG-30 and (reverse) 50 -CACCCTGACACATAAACCCTGG-30 ; human E-cadherin: (forward) 50 -ATGCTGATGCCCCCAATACC-30 and (reverse) 50 -TCCAAGCCCTTTGCTGTTTTC-30 ; human vimentin: (forward) 50 -TTGACAATGCGTCTCTGGCAC-30 and (reverse) 50 -CCTGGATTTCCTCTTCGTGGAG-30 ; human ZEB1: (forward) 50 -AACGCTTTTCCCATTCTGGC-30 and (reverse) 50 -GAGATGTCTTGAGTCCTGTTCTTGG-30 ; human SLUG: (forward) 50 -GCTCAGAAAGCCCCATTAGTGATG-30 and (reverse) 50 -GCCAGCCCAGAAAAAGTTGAATAG-30 ; human Twist: (forward) 50 -GTCCGCAGTCTTACGAGGAG-30 and (reverse) 50 -CCAGCTTGAGGGTCTGAATC-30 ; and human PTK6: (forward) 50 -GCTATGTGCCCCACAACTACC-30 and (reverse) 50 -CCTGCAGAGCGTGAACTCC-30 .
Proliferation, colony formation, and soft agar assays
For proliferation assays, subconﬂuent cells were seeded in
triplicate for each time point at a density of 2  103 cells per
well of 48-well plates. The fold increase in cell number was
measured by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega). For colony formation assays, cells were
seeded in triplicate at a density of 1  103 cells per well of
6-well plates 24 hours after transfection, and grown for 14 days
before ﬁxing and staining with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich).
For soft agar assays, 1.5  103 cells were seeded in triplicate on
the top layer of 6-well plates, which contained 0.35% agar in
growth medium containing 10% FBS. The bottom layer of soft
agar contained 0.7% agar in growth medium containing 10%
FBS. Cells were fed twice a week, and colonies were counted at
3 weeks after plating.
Migration and invasion chamber assays
For migration assays, cells were transfected with siRNAs for
24 hours if needed and then serum-starved for another 24
hours. A total of 5  104 cells were plated in the top chamber of

a Transwell (24-well insert; pore size, 8 mm; Corning) and
incubated with 1% FBS containing medium. Twenty percent
FBS-containing medium was added to the lower chamber as a
chemoattractant. After 18 hours, cells that did not migrate
through the pores were removed by a cotton swab, and the cells
on the lower surface of the membrane were stained by crystal
violet. BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD Pharmingen) were used for invasion assays, which were conducted in a
similar way to migration assays, except that 50 ng/mL HGF was
used as a chemoattractant and the incubation time was 24
hours. Images were taken under the phase-contrast microscope using 10 magniﬁcation.
Immunostaining
Cells were washed with PBS, ﬁxed in Carnoy's solution (6:3:1
ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid), then blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin for 1 hour, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were
used to detect primary antibodies made in mouse (green), and
biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were used and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated avidin to detect primary antibodies made in rabbit
(red). Slides were mounted with Vectashield ﬂuorescent mounting medium containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Vector Laboratories).
For staining of prostate tissues and tumors, antigen retrieval
was conducted in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer on a hot
plate at a temperature above 90 C for 20 minutes. Immunohistochemistry was conducted using the VECTASTAIN Elite
ABC Kit [rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)] or the mouse on
mouse (M.O.M.) kit as per the manufacturer's instructions
(Vector Laboratories). Reactions were visualized with FITC or
rhodamine-conjugated avidin, and slides were mounted in
Vectashield ﬂuorescent mount media containing DAPI, or
with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma-Aldrich) and counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories). Staining
controls were conducted with normal rabbit or mouse IgG.
Xenograft and murine prostate cancer models
To monitor metastases in vivo, pFU-L2G, which expresses
optimized luciferase (L2) and GFP (G; ref. 18), was introduced
into PC3 cells. Cells, selected for GFP expression, were transfected with PTK6 siRNA or control siRNA twice before intravenous injection into 6-week-old male SCID (IcrTac:ICRPrkdcscid; Taconic) mice. Tumor growth and metastases were
monitored weekly following injection of D-luciferin using the
Xenogen IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life
Sciences, Inc.). Alternatively, cells were introduced by intracardiac injection and mice were sacriﬁced at 10 weeks,
and internal organs were formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded. Generation and characterization of the PB-Cre4 and
Ptenﬂox/ﬂox mice have been described previously (19).
C57BL/6J PB-Cre4 Ptenﬂox/ﬂox mice were sacriﬁced at 6 months
of age and prostates were formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded. All mouse experiments were reviewed and approved by
the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.

Statistical analysis
Datasets containing 363 and 140 primary prostate cancer
samples and the patient information were extracted from the
Oncomine database (Compendia Bioscience). These include the
Setlur Prostate Dataset, National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) dataset GSE8402 (20), and the Taylor
prostate dataset, NCBI dataset GSE21035 (21). Patients were
categorized into "PTK6 high," "PTK6 medium," and "PTK6 low"
groups according to their PTK6 RNA expression levels. The
PTK6 high group represents the top 10%, whereas the PTK6 low
group represents the bottom 25% of the patients according to
PTK6 RNA levels. The PTK6 medium group represents the
remaining patients with intermediate PTK6 expression levels.
The survival curve or recurrence rate was estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier method and the differences among three groups
was tested using the log-rank test. The analysis was conducted
using SAS 9.2. PTK6 and E-cadherin mRNA levels were analyzed
in a NCBI human genome microarray dataset GDS2545, which
contains 171 human prostate samples including normal prostate tissue, normal tissue adjacent to the primary tumor,
primary tumor, and metastatic tumors. Results are shown as
the mean  SE. A linear regression model is set up using Ecadherin mRNA as a dependent variable and PTK6 as an
independent variable. For all the other cell studies, data represent the mean of at least 3 independent experiments  SD.
P values were determined using the one-tailed Student t test
(Microsoft Excel 2010) and two-sided Fisher exact test (GraphPad Prism 5). A difference was considered statistically significant if the P value was equal to or less than 0.05.

Results
Membrane-targeted PTK6 causes a cell-scattering
phenotype in prostate epithelial cells
PTK6 relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in
prostate epithelial tumor cells, as human prostate cancer
progresses (6). Phosphorylation of PTK6 at tyrosine residue
342 within its activation loop promotes activation (22). We
examined the localization of total PTK6 and active PTK6,
phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 342 (PY342), in three prostate epithelial cell lines PC3, DU145 (metastatic), and BPH1
(benign hyperplasia; ref. 17). Cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic, membrane/organelle, and nuclear compartments. In
all three cell lines, total PTK6 is primarily localized in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). However, immunoblotting for PY342
revealed that active PTK6 is localized at the membrane (Fig. 1A).
To explore functions of membrane-associated active PTK6,
PC3 and BPH1 cell lines stably expressing membrane-targeted
active PTK6 (Palm-PTK6-YF) were generated. Palm-PTK6-YF
contains dual fatty acylation sites for palmitoylation/myristoylation from the SRC-family kinase LYN at the amino terminus for membrane association (referred to here as Palm),
and mutation of the negative regulatory tyrosine at position
447 to phenylalanine (YF; ref. 4). Ectopic expression of PalmPTK6-YF was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Compared with vector control cells, both PC3 and BPH1 cells
expressing Palm-PTK6-YF undergo profound morphologic
changes, which include a rufﬂed membrane and fewer cell–
cell contacts (Fig. 1C). The rufﬂed membrane suggests the

Oncogenic Functions for PTK6 at the Membrane

Figure 1. Expression of Palm-PTK6-YF induced a cell-scattering phenotype in BPH1 and PC3 cells. A, the membrane pool of PTK6 is the active pool. PC3,
DU145, and BPH1 cells were fractionated into three cellular compartments including cytoplasm, membrane/organelle, and nucleus. Immunoblot analysis was
conducted with anti-P-PTK6 (PY342), PTK6, AKT, SP1, and b-catenin antibodies. AKT, SP1, and b-catenin localization were examined as controls for
fractionation. Although the majority of total PTK6 protein is cytoplasmic, the active pool (PY342) is membrane associated. B, Palm-PTK6-YF was stably
expressed in PC3 and BPH1 cells. Immunoblot analysis was conducted using anti-Myc-tag and b-actin antibodies. C, cells expressing Palm-PTK6-YF (B)
show the cell-scattering phenotype. Phase-contrast images of PC3 and BPH1 cells stably expressing Palm-PTK6-YF or vector are shown. Scale bar, 50 mm.
D, loss of E-cadherin at the membrane in PC3 cells stably expressing Palm-PTK6-YF. Cells were costained with anti-E-cadherin and phospho-tyrosine
(PY) antibodies, and counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 20 mm. E, BPH1 cells that form peripheral adhesion complexes show deregulated E-cadherin
at the cell membrane. Cells were costained with anti-E-cadherin and phospho-tyrosine antibodies and counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 20 mm.

formation of PTK6-induced peripheral adhesion complexes as
reported previously (5). Formation of these peripheral adhesion complexes was dependent upon PTK6 kinase activity and
did not form in cells expressing membrane-targeted kinase
defective PTK6 (5).
A cell-scattering phenotype is often coupled with the EMT
(12). Because both BPH1 and PC3 cells express E-cadherin, we
examined whether E-cadherin expression and localization are
altered by Palm-PTK6-YF expression. In both PC3 and BPH1
cells, expression of Palm-PTK6-YF led to a reduction in Ecadherin at the plasma membrane that was accompanied by
activation of phospho-tyrosine signaling in peripheral adhesion complexes (Fig. 1D and E). BPH1 cells that do not form
peripheral adhesion complexes with high levels of phosphotyrosine still contain E-cadherin at cell–cell contacts (Fig. 1E),
suggesting that phospho-tyrosine signaling is involved in
deregulating E-cadherin.

Active PTK6 at the plasma membrane promotes the EMT
Loss of E-cadherin is one of the hallmarks of EMT (12).
Reduced E-cadherin levels were detected in the presence of
Palm-PTK6-YF in PC3 cells (Fig. 2A). We examined expression
of other EMT markers and found that levels of vimentin and the
E-cadherin transcriptional repressor ZEB1 are increased in cells
expressing Palm-PTK6-YF (Fig. 2A). Following cell fractionation, we found that ectopic expression of Palm-PTK6-YF
largely increases the pool of active PTK6 at the membrane (Fig.
2B; PY342). Endogenous membrane-associated phospho-PTK6
is the main band detected by immunoblotting of control PC3
cell lysates with anti-PY342 (Fig. 2C, vector lanes, arrowhead).
Ectopic transfected Palm-PTK6 migrates slightly above the
endogenous band (Fig. 2C; Palm-YF). Expression of PalmPTK6-YF leads to decreased membrane association of E-cadherin, increased ZEB1 in the nucleus, and increased vimentin in
the cytoplasm and membrane (Fig. 2B). Levels of mRNAs

Figure 2. Active PTK6 at the plasma membrane promotes EMT in prostate tumor cells. A, immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates of PC3 cells stably
expressing Palm-PTK6-YF or vector was conducted using anti-E-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB1, Myc-tag, and b-catenin antibodies. Expression of b-catenin does
not change in cells expressing PTK6-Palm-YF (4) and it was used as a loading control. B, a subcellular fractionation assay was conducted using PC3 cells
expressing Palm-PTK6-YF or vector, and immunoblot analysis was conducted using anti-E-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB1, P-PTK6 (PY342), and PTK6
antibodies. Both short (SE) and long (LE) exposures of PTK6 immunoblot are shown. C, an uncropped blot is presented to show speciﬁcity of the PY342
antibody. An arrowhead points to endogenous active PTK6 localized at the membrane in PC3 cells (Vec). Ectopic Palm-PTK6-YF runs slightly above
the endogenous band in transfected cells (Palm-YF). D, mRNA levels of EMT markers are deregulated in Palm-PTK6-YF–expressing PC3 cells.

encoding EMT markers were also measured by either quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or semiquantitative PCR. Consistent with protein levels, expression of E-cadherin mRNA is
decreased, whereas levels of mRNAs encoding the mesenchymal
intermediate ﬁlament protein vimentin, and transcriptional
repressors of E-cadherin SLUG, Twist, and ZEB1 mRNAs are
increased (Fig. 2D and E).
AKT participates in PTK6-mediated induction of the EMT
AKT is a crucial regulator of the EMT in squamous cell
carcinoma lines (23). Previously, we observed increased AKT
activation in response to FBS stimulation in Palm-PTK6-YF–
expressing cells (5), and therefore examined whether AKT and
downstream signaling are involved in the PTK6-mediated
EMT. Phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 and Ser473, which
is required for its activation, is increased in PC3 cells expressing
Palm-PTK6-YF relative to total AKT (Fig. 3A). This is accompanied by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3b, a
direct target of AKT (Fig. 3A). AKT has been reported to
regulate the SNAIL family member SLUG (SNAI2), a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin (24). We see increased
expression (Fig. 3A) and nuclear localization (Fig. 3B) of SLUG
in Palm-PTK6-YF–expressing PC3 cells.
To test whether AKT activation is required for the PTK6induced EMT, we used siRNAs to knockdown endogenous AKT

5430

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

in PC3 cells. Following knockdown of AKT, E-cadherin levels are
increased and vimentin levels are decreased in both PalmPTK6-YF and vector control cells (Fig. 3C). However, expression
of E-cadherin in Palm-YF–expressing cells treated with AKT
siRNA remains lower than vector control cells treated with
scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3C), indicating that AKT knockdown only
partially rescues PTK6-induced EMT and that other mechanisms are involved. We also used siRNAs to knockdown the
scaffold protein p130CAS, which is crucial for AKT activation
(5). Following knockdown of p130CAS, AKT activity is reduced,
whereas total AKT levels are not changed (Fig. 3D). Decreased
AKT activity is accompanied by decreased GSK3b phosphorylation, increased E-cadherin expression, and decreased vimentin levels in both Palm-PTK6-YF and vector control cells (Fig.
3D). As in the AKT siRNA experiment, reduction of AKT
activation through knockdown of p130CAS only partially rescues EMT induced by Palm-PTK6-YF (Fig. 3D).
Palm-PTK6-YF promotes tumorigenicity and
invasiveness of PC3 cells
We examined the tumorigenic and invasive ability of PC3
cells stably expressing Palm-PTK6-YF in vitro and in vivo.
Expression of Palm-PTK6-YF promotes anchorage-independent growth of PC3 cells in soft agar (Fig. 4A), while not
affecting cell proliferation (data not shown), suggesting that

surviving mice. Using the two-sided Fisher exact test, we
determined that the association between Palm-PTK6-YF expression and poor survival outcome is signiﬁcant (P < 0.05). To
monitor in vivo metastasis, both Palm-PTK6-YF–expressing
and control PC3 cells, infected with lentivirus carrying a
luciferase gene and a GFP gene, were selected by GFP ﬂow
cytometry, and then intravenously injected into SCID mice. At
day 0, equal numbers of control vector and Palm-PTK6-YF cells
were injected and then traveled to the lungs, as shown in dorsal
and ventral views of luciferin-injected mice (Fig. 4E). After 1
week, increased levels of PC3 Palm-PTK6-YF cells were observed, indicating better survival of these tumor cells in vivo,
leading to increased metastases at day 50 (Fig. 4E). These data
show that membrane-targeted active PTK6 promotes the EMT
by conferring resistance to anoikis, as well as stimulating
anchorage-independent growth and cell migration, resulting
in increased metastasis in vivo.

Figure 3. PTK6-mediated EMT occurs partially through increased AKT
activity. A, increased AKT signaling in PC3 cells expressing Palm-PTK6YF. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates of PC3 cells stably
expressing Palm-PTK6-YF or vector (Vec) was conducted using antiAKT, P-AKT (Thr308), P-AKT (Ser473), P-GSK3b (Ser9), SLUG PTK6, and
b-catenin antibodies. Relative levels of P-AKT, P-GSK3b, and SLUG
normalized to b-catenin are indicated below the blots. B, increased

Palm-PTK6-YF–induced EMT. PC3 cells expressing Palm-PTK6-YF or

vimentin normalized to the b-catenin loading control are indicated below
the blots. D, knockdown of p130CAS partially rescues Palm-PTK6-YF–
induced EMT. PC3 cells expressing Palm-PTK6-YF or vector were
transfected with p130CAS siRNAs or control siRNAs for 3 days.
Immunoblotting was conducted with anti-p130CAS, AKT, P-AKT
(Thr308), P-GSK3b (Ser9), E-cadherin, vimentin, Myc-tag, and b-catenin
antibodies.

PC3 cells are less tumorigenic and invasive after
knockdown of PTK6
To determine if endogenous PTK6 participates in the EMT
and regulates tumorigenicity of PC3 cells, PTK6 was knocked
down using an siRNA-based approach. Knockdown of PTK6
persisted for at least 6 days posttransfection (Fig. 5A). Following PTK6 knockdown, E-cadherin levels increased, whereas
vimentin and ZEB1 levels decreased (Fig. 5A). In addition,
knockdown of PTK6 resulted in decreased proliferation (Fig.
5B), colony formation (Fig. 5C), and anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar (Fig. 5D). After PTK6 knockdown, the ability
of PC3 cells to invade through the extracellular matrix layer to
the bottom side of the membranes in invasion chamber assays
was diminished (Fig. 5E).
We conducted xenograft studies to monitor the impact of
PTK6 knockdown on metastasis in SCID mice. Luciferaseexpressing PC3 control cells and PTK6 knockdown cells were
injected intravenously into SCID mice and monitored in vivo
following injection with luciferin. Knockdown of PTK6 by
siRNA effectively reduced survival and metastasis of PC3 cells,
compared with control siRNA-treated cells, which metastasized by day 36 (Fig. 5F).

membrane-targeted PTK6 promotes the tumorigenicity of PC3
cells independently of activating cell proliferation pathways.
Transwell chamber assays showed that expression of PalmPTK6-YF promotes cell migration in vitro (Fig. 4B). To explore
the metastatic characteristics of Palm-PTK6-YF–expressing
PC3 cells in vivo, intracardiac injection was conducted in 6week-old severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID)
mice. In the group injected with Palm-PTK6-YF–expressing
cells, 3 of 5 mice were dead after 8 weeks, whereas the 2
surviving mice showed dramatic metastases to internal organs
including liver, lung, and pancreas after 12 weeks (Fig. 4C).
Tumors were visible in lung and liver tissues, and immunohistochemical staining for PTK6 showed membrane association of Palm-PTK6-YF in the tumor tissues, conﬁrming the
origin of the tumors (Fig. 4D). In the group injected with
control cells, only 1 of 5 mice was found dead after 8 weeks,
and no metastases were detected in internal organs in the 4

Activation of endogenous PTK6 at the membrane in Ptennull mouse prostates correlates with the EMT
To investigate the signiﬁcance of PTK6 relocalization in vivo,
we used a murine prostate cancer model (PB-Cre4, Ptenﬂox/ﬂox;
ref. 19). Compared with wild-type control mice, disruption of
Pten led to an abnormally enlarged anterior prostate (AP) at the
age of 8 months in male mice (Fig. 6A, white hatch marks).
Consistent with previous reports, loss of both Pten alleles
results in early murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)
formation that can progress to adenocarcinoma (25). Preexisting prostatic ductules and acini in PB-Cre4, Ptenﬂox/ﬂox mice
were ﬁlled with cells derived from the hyperproliferative
epithelium, whereas a single layer of epithelial cells was present
in the control mice (Fig. 6B). Knockout of Pten and activation of
AKT were observed in prostate epithelial cells in PB-Cre4,
Ptenﬂox/ﬂox mice (Fig. 6B). As expected, PTK6 was detected
within nuclei of normal prostate epithelial cells in wild-type

mice, but it was primarily cytoplasmic in the Pten null prostate
(Fig. 6B; PTK6). Interestingly, in addition to relocalization of
PTK6 from nucleus to cytoplasm, we detected signiﬁcant
association of activated endogenous PTK6 phosphorylated at
the tyrosine residue 342 with the plasma membrane in the Pten
null prostates (Fig. 6B; Ptenﬂox/ﬂox, PY342). In the wild-type
prostate, active PTK6 is largely conﬁned to the nucleus (Fig. 6B;
Ptenwt/wt, PY342).
To determine the lineage of the cells with active membrane
associated PTK6, dual immunostaining was conducted using
antibodies speciﬁc for markers that identify subpopulations of
human and murine prostatic epithelial cells (25). Anti-phospho-tyrosine and anti-PTK6 PY342 antibodies recognized the
same group of cells with high phospho-tyrosine signaling at the
plasma membrane (Fig. 6C, a). An expanded pool of cytokeratin
5 (CK5)þ, p63þ (basal cell marker) cells was observed within
prostatic ductules upon homozygous Pten deletion, consistent
with a previous report (25). However, cells with activated PTK6
at the membrane do not express CK5 and p63 (Fig. 6C, b–e), but
are CK8 (luminal cell marker)-positive (Fig. 6C, f and g),

5432

suggesting they are derived from luminal secretory cells. Most
of the phospho-tyrosine–positive cells are not proliferative as
evidenced by Ki67 and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining,
although there are more proliferating cells in the Pten null
prostates compared with normal prostate in control mice
(Fig. 6C, h–j). Phospho-tyrosine–positive cells are larger than
surrounding phospho-tyrosine–negative cells, which led us to
examine proteins involved in cell–cell contacts. The cells with
activated PTK6 signaling at the plasma membrane show decreased E-cadherin and increased E-cadherin endocytosis (Fig.
6C, k–m). In addition, increased levels of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, were detected in most of the prostate tumor
cells in Pten null prostates (Fig. 6C, n and o). These data suggest
that cells with high phospho-tyrosine signaling and active
PTK6 at the plasma membrane are undergoing the EMT.

Oncogenic Functions for PTK6 at the Membrane

Figure 5. PC3 cells are less tumorigenic and invasive after knockdown of PTK6. A, E-cadherin is increased upon knockdown of PTK6 in PC3 cells. PC3 cells
were transfected with PTK6 siRNAs or control siRNAs for 2, 4, or 6 days. Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-E-cadherin, ZEB1, PTK6,
and b-actin antibodies. Relative levels of E-cadherin, vimentin, and ZEB1 expression normalized to actin levels are indicated below the blots. B, a
growth curve of PC3 cells transfected with PTK6 siRNAs or control siRNAs shows decreased proliferation from day 1 to 7 after PTK6 knockdown. Relative light
units (RLU) were measured by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. C, the number of colonies that form on plates 2 weeks postplating is
decreased upon PTK6 knockdown. Corresponding images are shown below the graph. D, the number of colonies that form in soft agar 3 weeks postplating is
decreased upon PTK6 knockdown. Representative images are shown. E, cell invasion is impaired upon PTK6 knockdown in Matrigel invasion chamber
assays. F, knockdown of PTK6 in PC3 cells largely reduces metastases in SCID mice. PC3 cells stably expressing luciferase were transfected with PTK6 siRNA
or control siRNA twice before injection. Mice were monitored under IVIS spectrum imaging system every week.

cancer samples and patient information was extracted from
the Oncomine database (20). Patients were categorized into
PTK6 high, PTK6 medium, and PTK6 low groups according
to their relative PTK6 mRNA level. The Kaplan–Meier survival
curve indicated that patients with higher PTK6 mRNA expression have signiﬁcantly poorer survival outcomes, whereas
lower PTK6 expression levels were associated with better
overall survival (P < 0.005; Fig. 7A). Analysis of another dataset
containing 140 prostate carcinoma samples with recurrence
information was also extracted and analyzed using the
Kaplan–Meier method (21). Higher PTK6 expression was associated with earlier recurrence (P < 0.05; Fig. 7B). We have
reported that PTK6 expression is signiﬁcantly increased in
human metastatic prostate cancer (5). Analysis of the same
dataset reveals decreased levels of E-cadherin in metastatic
prostate cancer (Fig. 7C). Importantly, linear regression anal-

www.aacrjournals.org

yses show an inverse correlation of PTK6 and E-cadherin
mRNA in normal tissue and metastatic cancer groups, indicating one unit change of PTK6 can be used to predict change
in E-cadherin levels (Fig. 7D). We also assessed activation of
PTK6 in human prostate tumor tissues. PTK6 is highly activated at the plasma membrane of a group of tumor cells in a
Gleason grade 4–5 prostate tumor (Fig. 7E, a and b), but not in
two other Gleason grade 3 tumors (Fig. 7E, c and d). These data
indicate that membrane-associated PTK6 activation is a marker for a subset of patients with prostate cancer and suggest that
targeting PTK6 may have therapeutic beneﬁts.

Discussion
A variety of studies indicate that PTK6 has context and
condition-speciﬁc functions. PTK6 negatively regulates

proliferation, promotes differentiation, and mediates apoptosis in normal cells of the intestinal tract and skin, whereas it
promotes proliferation, migration, and survival in breast,
colon, ovarian, and prostate tumor cells (reviewed in refs. 8,
9, 26). Differences in PTK6 expression, activation, and intracellular localization, as well as expression of distinct sets of
substrates and associated proteins in different cell types, would
facilitate activation of distinct signaling pathways in normal
and cancer cells. In normal cells, PTK6 is induced and activated
in response to differentiation (27, 28) or stress such as DNAdamage (29, 30). On the other hand, the expression of PTK6 is
signiﬁcantly induced in various cancer cells, including breast
cancer and prostate cancer (5, 31), where high levels of PTK6
predict poor prognosis in human patients (Fig. 7; ref. 32).
Our data are the ﬁrst to show that activation of PTK6 at the
membrane can positively contribute to the EMT. In vivo studies
show that endogenous mouse PTK6 protein is active at the
membrane in the Pten null prostate, and this correlates with
reduced E-cadherin expression. In addition, we found that
PTK6 is activated at the membrane in invasive human tumor
samples. Expression of membrane-targeted PTK6 in PC3 cells
led to repression of E-cadherin expression, a more mesenchymal phenotype, as well as increased tumorigenicity and metastases in xenograft models, further supporting a direct role for
PTK6 in promoting the EMT. Recently, knockdown of PTK6 in

5434

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

a subline of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells engineered to
overexpress HER2, led to increased E-cadherin and decreased
mesenchymal marker expression, suggesting PTK6 also regulates the EMT in other cancers (33).
Membrane association of SRC kinases through amino-terminal lipid modiﬁcation is critical for them to be able to
transform cells (34). We have shown that even though PTK6
is not myristoylated/palmitoylated, the active endogenous
protein can be found at the membrane (5, 11). Previously, we
reported that membrane-targeted PTK6 has transforming
potential, whereas nuclear PTK6 is growth inhibiting (4, 7).
We showed that membrane-targeted PTK6 transforms mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts lacking the SRC-family members SRC,
YES, and FYN (11). We detected nuclear localization of endogenous PTK6 in normal prostates, and relocalization of PTK6 to
the cytoplasm and membrane in prostate tumors (Fig. 6; ref. 6).
Activation and translocation of PTK6 in prostate cancer could
lead to phosphorylation and activation of non-nuclear substrates to which it does not normally have access. Mechanisms
regulating PTK6 intracellular shuttling are not well understood, but may be mediated through protein–protein interactions that could be modulated by expression of different PTK6
isoforms encoded by differentially spliced mRNAs (35).
PTK6 participates in several signaling pathways associated
with cell migration, survival, and metastasis (reviewed in

refs. 26, 36). It regulates signaling by ERBB receptors (37, 38), the
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor MET (39), and IGF-I
(32, 40). Its substrates include Paxillin (41), AKT (10), EGFR (42),
p130CAS (5), and FAK (11). PTK6 also regulates p190RhoGAP
(43) and ERK5 (44) activity. PTK6-mediated deregulation of Ecadherin could involve several PTK6 downstream players,
including AKT, p130CAS, FAK, and ERK5. AKT signaling promotes the EMT in different cancer cell lines (23, 45, 46). PTK6
confers resistance to anoikis, a hallmark of the EMT (reviewed in
ref. 47), which may occur through both direct and indirect
activation of AKT (5, 10, 11). AKT is a direct substrate of PTK6
and it is also activated downstream of the PTK6 substrates
p130CAS (5) and FAK (11). Here, we show that Palm-PTK6
promotes AKT activation and regulation of its downstream
targets, including GSK3b and the E-cadherin repressor SLUG
(Fig. 3), and this contributes in part to PTK6-mediated regula-

tion of the EMT. Knockdown of the PTK6 substrate p130CAS
impairs AKT activation (5), and partially rescues E-cadherin
downregulation induced by Palm-PTK6-YF (Fig. 3D). Previously,
we have shown that ERK5 plays an important signaling role
downstream of p130CAS in cells expressing membrane-targeted
active PTK6 (5). ERK5 has been implicated in breast cancer cell
metastasis (48), and is required for HGF-induced cell migration
in breast cancer cells (39).
In prostate cancer, decreased levels of E-cadherin are associated with high prostate tumor grade and poor prognosis.
Patients with normal E-cadherin expression have a signiﬁcantly higher overall survival rate than patients with low expression
(49, 50). Here, we show that PTK6 is aberrantly expressed and
activated in prostate tumor cells in some patients, and its levels
are inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression in metastatic prostate cancer (Fig. 7). Targeting PTK6 using siRNAs

ﬁndings suggest that PTK6 is a novel gene marker in categorizing prostate cancer patient groups, and a potential gene
