ABSTRACT
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway conveys growth factor and mitogen signalling
to control the phosphorylation of a plethora of substrates regulating proliferation,
survival, and migration. The Ras signalling pathway is frequently associated with poor
prognosis and drug resistance in various cancers including those of the blood, breast
and prostate. Activation of the downstream effector ERK does not always occur via a
linear cascade of events; complicating the targeting of this pathway therapeutically.
This work describes a novel positive feedback loop where the cell cycle regulatory
factor Spy1 (RINGO; gene SPDYA) activates ERK1/2 in a MEK-independent fashion.
Spy1 was originally isolated for the ability to stimulate Xenopus oocyte maturation via
a MAPK-signalling pathway and is known to override apoptosis triggered by the DNA
damage response. We demonstrate that mammalian Spy1-mediated ERK activation
increases ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of estrogen receptor
α, correlating with a decrease in tamoxifen sensitivity. This could define a novel
druggable mechanism driving proliferation and resistance in select cancers.

INTRODUCTION

a family of ‘cyclin-like’ proteins that are expressed and
degraded in a cyclic manner and are able to directly bind
and activate the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK)s [14–16].
Spy1 functions in an atypical manner to classical cyclins
in that it binds to both the G1/S and G2/M CDKs and
directs phosphorylation of non-canonical CDK substrates
[12, 17, 18]. Activation of the CDKs by Spy1 occurs
independent of phosphorylation within the T-loop and
dephosphorylation on defined inhibitory residues [17].
Further, Spy1 directly binds and promotes the degradation
of the CDK inhibitor, p27Kip1 [8, 19]. Hence, Spy1 supports
rapid progression through the cell cycle even in the face
of senescence and apoptotic-inducing stimuli [4, 5]. This
suggests a mechanism by which Spy1 overrides cell-cycle
induced apoptosis caused by therapeutic agents, which
could support drug resistance.
Proliferative programs in the breast, both during
normal development and breast cancer, are in part dictated
by signalling through the steroidal estrogen receptor alpha
(ERα). ERα changes into an active conformation upon
binding to the ligand estradiol (E2) [20]. Classical ER
activation promotes receptor homodimerization, nuclear

Overall 5 year survival rates for breast cancer have
increased by almost 20% since 1975, largely because of
improved screening and drugs developed against estrogen
signalling (ie. tamoxifen) and the Her2/Neu receptor
(ie. trastuzumab) [1]. Despite these advances, a subset of
patients either progress to, or initially present with, cancers
that are unresponsive to current targeted therapies [2, 3].
As such, breast cancer remains the second leading cause
of death from cancer among women [1]. Determining the
mechanisms regulating the initiation and/or progression to
a drug resistant status represents a current challenge in the
breast cancer field.
This work focused on a cell cycle protein coined
Spy1 (Speedy, RINGO) (gene SPDYA) that is elevated in
a number of human cancers, including invasive carcinoma
of the breast, as well as cancers of the liver, brain, and
blood [4–12]. In the breast, Spy1 levels are elevated
during proliferative stages of mammary development
(puberty and pregnancy) and forced expression can drive
mammary tumorigenesis [13]. Spy1 is one member of

translocation and subsequent DNA binding to estrogen
response elements (EREs) to regulate the expression of
various genes [21]. ‘Non-classical’ genomic signalling
also exists where the E2-ERα complex binds transcription
factors to regulate genes lacking an ERE, like Cyclin
D1 [22–25]. ER dimers, activated by E2 or other growth
factors, can also interact and form complexes directly with
G-proteins, receptor tyrosine kinases, and non-receptor
tyrosine kinases [26]. Non-classical ER signalling can
thereby trigger signal transduction pathways such as
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) [27]. Collectively,
ERα works via these diverse mechanisms to promote
breast cell growth and survival [20, 28].
Tamoxifen functions by competitively binding
to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ERα, altering
its conformation such that it can no longer bind to E2,
hence, preventing E2 proliferative signalling [29]. The
binding efficiency of tamoxifen can be altered by the
phosphorylation status of residues within ERα capable
of inducing ligand independent signalling [30, 31].
Phosphorylation on serine (S) 118 by extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK)1/2 is one prominent example
of such a modification. S118 phosphorylation promotes
hypersensitivity to E2 and decreases ERα affinity for
tamoxifen [30, 32–35]. ERK1/2 is the final kinase at the
end of the Ras/MAPK signalling cascade, succeeding Ras,
Raf and MEK activation. Given that non-classical ERα
signalling can activate a MAPK cascade, this represents a
feedback mechanism enforcing activity of the ER [23, 24,
36–40].
The Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK cascade is hyperactivated
in approximately 30% of human cancers; a large
percentage characterised by a mutation in either the Ras
or Raf genes [41, 42]. Constitutively activated MEK1/2
is frequently seen in cancer cell lines, contributing to
increased cell survival, migration and transformation
[42]. Overexpression and hyperphosphorylation of
ERK1/2 has been seen in various cancers, including
hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer [41, 42].
Pharmacological intervention upstream of ERK1/2 has
received considerable focus; however, to date clinical
results are largely underwhelming, with preclinical
and clinical documentation showing a development of
acquired resistance shortly after receiving treatment
[43, 44]. Resistance is largely associated with re-activation
of ERK1/2 signalling [45]. As such, specific inhibitors of
ERK1/2 have become a focus over the last 5 years. Use of
an ERK1/2 inhibitor can overcome acquired resistance to
both BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors in melanoma, breast
and colon cancer cell lines [45, 46]. This exciting data has
led to the introduction of the ERK1/2 inhibitor into phase I
clinical trials for solid tumours [45, 47, 48]. Understanding
the activation of all components of this pathway influences
the successful intervention of a large number of cancers,
including breast cancer.

Spy1 is upregulated downstream of the estrogen
receptor
Spy1 is upregulated downstream of c-Myc and
developmental expression patterns mimic that seen
with c-Myc [13, 49]. Given that c-Myc is upregulated
downstream of ERα [50]; we used ERα-positive MCF7
breast cancer cells to determine whether Spy1 protein is also
regulated downstream of ERα. Spy1 protein levels were
elevated over a period of 1–6 hours following E2 treatment
(Figure 1A). Protein levels were also elevated in response
to E2 following reconstitution of ERα in ER negative
HEK-293 cells (Figure 1B and 1C). These data indicate
that upregulation of Spy1 protein levels occurs downstream
of the estrogen signalling pathway. Overexpression of
Spy1 in ER-positive MCF7 cells demonstrates a significant
increase in the phosphorylation of the ER at S118
(Figure 1D). To determine if this was due to enhanced
proliferation through G1/S, the G1/S cyclin, Cyclin E1,
was overexpressed and phosphorylation of ER-S118
measured (Figure 1D). Elevated levels of Cyclin E1 had no
significant change in ER-S118 phosphorylation.
Spy1 is capable of promoting the activation of the
MAPK pathway when injected into unfertilized Xenopus
oocytes [16], and S118 is phosphorylated by several kinases
including ERK1/2 of the MAPK pathway [30, 33, 51].
We measured the activity of ERK (phospho-T202/
Y204; pERK) in the presence of overexpressed Spy1 and
found a significant increase in the level of phospho-ERK
(Figure 1D), this was also seen in other cell systems
(Supplementary Figure 1A–1B). While a slight increase
in phosphorylation was also seen with Cyclin E1
overexpression, this difference was not statistically
significant. These data support that activation of ERK,
seen downstream of Spy1 overexpression, is not a
generalized effect due to cell proliferation. To determine if
Spy1 is a necessary mediator of ERK activation, HEK-293
cells were infected with shRNA lentivirus targeting two
separate regions of the Spy1 mRNA (shSpy1.1, shSpy1.2).
shRNA against Cyclin E1 was also used to address the
essentiality of classical cyclin-CDK activation (shCyclinE)
and a pLKO-shScrambled control (pLKO). Both of the
shSpy1 constructs significantly decreased endogenous
activated ERK levels (Figure 1E and Supplementary
Figure 1C); this effect was not noted with shCyclinE
treatment despite successful knockdown (Figure 1E and
Supplementary Figure 1C; left panel representative blot).
Spy1 effects were reversed by a rescue construct, showing
specificity of the sh-targeting (resSpy1; Figure1E). These
results support that Spy1 is a required component for
activation of ERK1/2 in this cell culture system.
To determine whether one of ERK1 or ERK2 was
preferentially affected by Spy1, bands were separated to
easily differentiate the family members and blotted with

regulate ERK1/2; PP2A, MAPK Phosphatase (MKP)1,
MKP2, and MKP3 [52]. We questioned whether Spy1
expression could alter the expression level of any of
these phosphatases. As seen in Figure 3C, neither Spy1
or Cyclin E1 overexpression significantly decreased
the protein levels of these phosphatases, Spy1 actually
increased PP2A and MKP2 protein levels. It is intriguing
to hypothesize that this is a cellular response to retain
steady state due to enhanced activation of ERK1/2.

Spy1 activation of ERK1/2 is dependent on CDK
activation

Spy1 activation of ERK is dependent on Ras and Raf
To determine whether alternate upstream activators
of ERK1/2 are important in Spy1-mediated effects
we tested the consequences of Spy1 overexpression
in the presence of Ras and c-Raf inhibitors, Farnesyl
Thiosalicyclic Acid and GW5074, respectively. When
c-Raf or Ras are inhibited Spy1 is no longer able to
activate ERK as compared to the control, indicating that
the regulation of pERK by Spy1 requires both Raf and Ras
activation (Figure 4A). Moeller et al. (2003) showed Ras
activation requires the inhibition of p27. Binding of p27
to Grb2 blocks the interaction of Grb2 with the guanine
nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, thereby, inhibiting the
formation of the Grb2/SOS complex, which is required
to activate Ras [53]. Spy1-CDK2 can bind to and directly
inhibit p27 [8, 19]. This work shows that Spy1 inhibits p27
levels in the absence and presence of Raf/Ras inhibitors
(Figure 4A, hollow bars), demonstrating that this aspect
of Spy1 activity is intact and that ERK-mediated effects
reside downstream of p27 degradation. To investigate the
importance of the direct Spy1-p27 interaction, a Spy1-p27
binding mutant (R170) was utilized [54]. Spy1-R170
prevents the downregulation of endogenous p27 seen
with Spy1-WT as previously published (Figure 4B)
[54]. Interestingly, when cells were infected with R170
lentivirus there was no statistical increase in ERK
phosphorylation as seen with Spy1-WT (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Figure 2). Collectively, these data show
the Spy1-CDK complex requires the activation of Ras and
depends on the direct interaction with p27 to significantly
increase pERK protein levels.

Using a previously characterized Spy1-CDK nonbinding mutant (Spy1-D90A) [17], we questioned whether
the direct binding between Spy1 and the CDK is essential
for activation of ERK1/2. Transient transfection with wildtype Spy1 shows a significant increase in the activation
of ERK1/2 (Figure 2A), and a significant increase in
proliferation, as compared to control and D90 transfected
cells (Figure 2B). These data support the hypothesis that
the activation of ERK1/2 is dependent on Spy1-mediated
CDK activity. It is notable that altered migration of the
Spy1-D90A mutant on SDS page gel has been consistently
reported in the literature [17]. Spy1 can bind to both
CDK1 and CDK2 [6, 12, 17]. To determine which CDK
is most influential on Spy1-activated ERK, cells were
transfected with Myc-tagged Spy1 and low levels of either
an HA-tagged CDK1or CDK2 dominant negative (DN)
vector (CDK1 DN or CDK2 DN), or relevant controls.
The concentration of DN vector transfected did not
significantly impair growth alone; however, both CDK1
and CDK2 DN vectors significantly impaired the ability
of Spy1 to activate ERK1/2 (Figure 2C). Collectively, this
data supports that Spy1-mediated phosphorylation of ERK
requires at least one of the CDKs to be present and bound.

Spy1-mediated ERK1/2 activation is MEKindependent
In the breast, Spy1 levels are elevated by MAPK/
ERK and c-Myc signalling to promote proliferation and
override differentiation stimuli [13, 16]. In the presence
of U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, we see a decrease in
endogenous pERK1/2, as well as a significant decrease
in overall endogenous Spy1 protein levels, as seen
previously [13]. In cells overexpressing Spy1, U0126
does not significantly reduce the ability of Spy1 to
activate ERK1/2 (Figure 3A), suggesting that Spy1
activates ERK1/2 independent of MEK. Using a MEK1/2
DN in combination with Spy1 overexpression, pERK
continues to be significantly activated, further supporting
a MEK-independent mode of activation (Figure 3B).
Another level of regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
is through the steady state removal of phosphorylation
by the relevant phosphatases. Four major phosphatases

Spy1 overexpression may function through RIPK2
Receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2
(RIPK2) is phosphorylated and activated through Rasactivated Raf kinase [55]. One established downstream
substrate of RIPK2 is ERK1/2 in vitro and in vivo [55].
To determine whether the effects of Spy1 overexpression
on ERK1/2 could be mediated through RIPK2, cells were
transfected with Myc-tagged-Spy1 followed by infection
with lentivirus packaging either scrambled control shRNA
(pLKO) or shRNA targeting two different regions of the
RIPK2 mRNA (shRIPK2.1, shRIPK2.2) (Figure 4D). In
the presence of RIPK2 knockdown, a decrease in pERK1/2

pEIZ-Spy1 or empty vector control (pEIZ) (Figure 5A).
Cells were treated with 100 nM tamoxifen for 24 hours
and subjected to the trypan blue exclusion assay. Spy1
overexpression significantly increased cell number as
compared to pEIZ control in untreated cells, as has
been previously published [57]. Interestingly, when
tamoxifen was added, Spy1 continued to drive cell
proliferation, but pEIZ control populations failed to
proliferate (Figure 5A), supporting that elevated levels of
Spy1 reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen. We implemented
a zebrafish xenograft model to elucidate whether Spy1

toxicity studies show reliable screening in the zebrafish

and that this model is a suitable predictive alternative to
mammalian systems [59, 60]. Furthermore, key cell cycle

of estrogen signalling are all highly conserved in the

cells followed by therapeutic drug testing in zebrafish is
more efficient than using immunocompromised mice since
the adaptive immune system does not develop until 14
days post fertilization (dpf) and, hence, tumour responses
can be studied in the presence of residual immune
competence  [62]. The zebrafish model also allows for
high throughput testing of drug combinations in a short
time frame, being both cost and time efficient. To validate
the model, fluorescently labelled MCF7 or tamoxifen
resistant LCC9 cells [63] were injected into embryos at 48
hours post-fertilization (hpf) and treated with tamoxifen
for 24 hours (Supplementary Figure 3). Fish were imaged
and quantified before and after treatment to determine the
changes in number of tumour foci per fish, as quantified by
total fluorescence. Tumour foci at 24 hours post-treatment
(hpt) demonstrate that while the MCF7 cells respond
to treatment, the LCC9 cells are resistant to tamoxifen
treatment (Supplementary Figure 3). Sensitive MCF7
cells were then infected with pEIZ control or pEIZ-Spy1
vectors and injected into zebrafish embryos (Figure 5B).
Vehicle control (DMSO) or tamoxifen was administered
48 hours post-implantation (hpi) and tumour foci were
imaged for each fish at 0 hpt and 24 hpt. The fold change
in tumour foci was recorded for each individual embryo to
control for variation in injected cell number (quantification
lower graph). Tamoxifen had a significant effect on overall
cell numbers in control infected cells, which may be a
combination of cytostatic and cell death effects. However,
when Spy1 was overexpressed there was a significant
decrease in sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment in vivo
(Figure 5B; lower panel).

cells in both control and Spy1 overexpressing cells
(Figure 6D). Importantly, Spy1-mediated proliferation
was not abrogated by tamoxifen alone but ERK inhibition
prevented Spy1-mediated effects on growth (Figure 6D;
tamoxifen lanes).
Collectively, these data show that Spy1, an atypical
cell cycle protein expressed at elevated levels in many
human cancers, alters the post-translational status of the ER
and abrogates response to hormone therapy through ERK1/2
activation. Novel therapies focusing on the direct inhibition
of ERK1/2 in patient populations harbouring elevated levels
of Spy1 may represent a novel therapeutic direction for both
treating drug resistant patients and preventing/decreasing the
incidence of resistance in ER-positive patients.

DISCUSSION
In breast cancer estrogen can independently regulate
the expression and function of the proto-oncogene c-Myc
followed by a rapid activation of the G1 CDK, CDK2,
to induce cell cycle progression [25, 64, 65]. Previous
reports have perplexed that following estrogen treatment
there is little or no change in the levels of Cyclin E, CDK2
or in the formation of cyclin E–CDK2 complexes prior
to entry into S phase [66]. This work demonstrates that
the atypical cyclin partner for CDK2, Spy1, is transiently
upregulated downstream of activated ERα. This reveals a
novel pathway for exploration important both to normal
development and a host of pathologies. It is interesting to
note that a shift in the mobility of Spy1 was seen upon the
addition of E2. Whether this is due to a post-translational
modification on Spy1 will require further examination.
Additionally, we have shown that Spy1 can induce a
unique activation of ERK1/2 that may in part dictate ERmediated proliferation in some ER+ breast cancer cells.
It is important to note that post-translational
modification of the ERK1/2 complex is a transient and
highly dynamic process [67]. Our data demonstrates that
at any specific time breast cancer cells with elevated levels
of Spy1 have higher activated ERK1/2 as measured by
a general phospho-antibody. Our data further suggests
that this is indirect, introducing even more variability
in the dynamics of the event. Further investigation
into the specific phosphorylation sites on each ERK
isoform showed a significant increase in the level of
phosphorylation on both sites of ERK2 (T185 and Y187),
but only one site of ERK1 (T202). More work would be
required to determine if there is any site specificity. It is
enticing to consider that perhaps Spy1-CDK mediated
signalling could have some direct effects on the posttranslational status of the MAPK pathway or direct
effectors. Interestingly, Spy1-CDK activation of ERK is
unique to Spy1 in that Cyclin E overexpression did not
demonstrate a statistically significant change in ERK
activation over multiple repetitions. It is notable that we
have seen variability in the effects of Cyclin E on ERK

Targeting Spy1-directed ERK activation
sensitizes cells to tamoxifen
We have demonstrated that Spy1 activates ERK,
and subsequent phosphorylation of ERα-S118 in a MEKindependent, but Ras-dependent, fashion (Figures 3–4). To
test whether Spy1 effects on tamoxifen sensitivity were
mediated through this pathway, MCF7 cells were treated
with tamoxifen in the presence or absence of the MEK
inhibitor U0126. When Spy1 levels were elevated, even
in the presence of tamoxifen, the levels of pERα-S118
were significantly increased as compared to control and
Cyclin E1overexpression and this occurred in a MEKindependent fashion (Figure 6A–6B). We then measured
the effect of direct inhibition of ERK1/2 on Spy1-mediated
effects on pERα-S118. MCF7 cells overexpressing Spy1
or control were treated with 10 µM ERK1/2 inhibitor
(SCH772984), either alone or in combination with 100 nM
tamoxifen (Figure 6C). Spy1 significantly increases
pERα-S118 in control situations but not in the presence of
the ERK inhibitor (with or without Tamoxifen). Cells were
then counted for viability after treatment using the trypan
blue exclusion assay. We show that the use of the ERK1/2
inhibitor alone significantly reduces the number of viable

activation that do not preclude that Cyclin E may activate
ERK under specific experimental conditions.
ERα proliferative signalling in breast cancer cells is
dependent upon ligand binding and/or post-translational
modification to enable signalling in the absence of ligand.
Post-translational modifications to ERα can render the
receptor ligand-independent and resistant to anti-estrogen
therapies. Phosphorylation on S118 of ERα is one such
modification that can lead to tamoxifen resistance [51].
Cellular cycling influences the phosphorylation status
of ERα in a manner that is dependent upon mitogen
stimulation [25, 68]. In particular, phosphorylation on
S118 is regulated by activated ERK1/2 [33, 34, 51].
This work demonstrates that Spy1 levels correlate with
an increase in phosphorylation of S118 on ERα in a
manner dependent on ERK1/2 activity, thereby providing
a direct link between ER modification and the cell cycle
machinery.
Lenormand et al. (1999) showed that Spy1 could
activate MAPK in Xenopus oocytes [16]. Unlike the
Lenormand data, however, Spy1 activation of ERK1/2
in the human breast cell line, MCF7, appears to be
independent of MEK, and at least in part dependent on
the direct interaction between Spy1 and the cell cycle
inhibitor p27. Our work is not the first to show a MEKindependent activation of ERK1/2, Aksamitiene et al.
(2010), have demonstrated that ERK1/2 can be activated
in a MEK-independent, but PI3K/Akt-sensitive fashion,
in the ER-positive breast cancer cell line T47D [69]. Our
data supports that upstream pathways driven by Spy1 may

converge on an activation of the novel ERK activator
RIPK2 (See Figure 7).
Mutations within Ras and Raf, or hyperactivation of
MEK1/2 has spurred the production of pharmacological
inhibitors targeting mediators upstream of ERK1/2;
however, resistance and relapse occurs within 6 to 7
months of treatment [45]. Our findings may suggest that in
some cancers with an elevated Spy1 overexpression small
molecule inhibitors for MEK1/2 may be ineffective. Indeed,
we have shown elevated levels of Spy1 alone can override
MEK1/2 inhibitors and increase the phosphorylation status
of ER on S118. Since ERK1/2 activation significantly
promotes uncontrolled cell growth, survival, and invasion,
determining a way to suspend ERK1/2 activation by Spy1
could have clinical implications for tamoxifen resistance
and breast cancer therapies in at least subsets of patients.
A significant decrease in cell viability and a concomitant
decrease in phosphorylation of ERα-S118 in the presence
of elevated Spy1 was seen only when ERK1/2 was directly
inhibited. The discovery of a new inhibitor specifically
targeting the ATP-binding site of ERK1/2 has shown
promising results with respect to solid tumours [45, 46].
Indeed, our data herein shows that inhibition of ERK1/2
results in an abrogation of S118-ERα phosphorylation and
a significant restoration of response to tamoxifen treatment
in ER+ cells with elevated Spy1 levels. Hence, therapies
focusing on the direct inhibition of ERK1/2 in ER+ patient
populations harbouring elevated levels of Spy1 may
represent an effective therapeutic direction for preventing/
decreasing resistance to hormone therapy.

Figure 7: Schematic diagram of proposed pathway. Our data supports that elevated levels of Spy1 can act upstream to activate
ERK1/2 through a MEK-independent pathway. Our data supports that this depends on a direct interaction with p27, as well as Ras and
Raf activation. A novel pathway has been described demonstrating a Raf downstream kinase, RIPK2 [55] capable of activating ERK1/2
in a MEK-independent fashion. Our data shows a dependence of Spy1-mediated effects on RIPK2. Spy1-mediated ERK1/2 activation can
phosphorylate the ER on S118 and alter sensitivity to tamoxifen.

RIPK2 (sc-8610), ERK1/2 (sc-154), MKP1 (sc-271684),
MKP2 (sc-1200), MKP3 (sc-8598), PP2A (sc-6110),
and Raf1 (sc-7267) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Phospho-ERK 1/2 (Thr 202/Tyr 204)was
purchased from Cell Signaling (4370).

Cell culture
Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 and MCF7
cells were purchased from ATCC and were subcultured
in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and
30,000 units penicillin/30,000 µg streptomycin solution.
Cells were maintained under normoxic conditions
(5% CO2) at 37°C. LCC9 cells (Lombardi Comprehensive
Cancer Center, Georgetown University) were routinely
subcultured in DMEM phenol red free media supplemented
with 1 mM L-glutamine, 30,000 units penicillin/30,000
µgstreptomycin,and 10% charcoal treated FBS. Cells were
maintained under normoxic conditions (5% CO2) at 37°C.

Transfection/infection
Transfection
Cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI)
branched reagent (Sigma, 408727). In brief, 10 µg of DNA
was mixed with 3 µl of 10 mg/ml PEI for 10 minutes then
added to a 10 cm tissue culture plate. Transfection media
was changed after 24 hours.

Plasmids

Infection

Creation of the Myc-Spy1-pCS3 was described
previously [57].Plasmids for Rc-CMV-Cyclin E (#8963),
pEGFP-C1-ERα (#28230), HA-CDK1-DN (#1889), DN9
(Mek1 dominant negative; #21209), and pLKO-scrambled
control (#8453) were purchased from Addgene. pLKOshSpy1 and pLKO-shCyclin E were cloned to express a
short hairpin previously described to knockdown Spy1 and
Cyclin E respectively and are previously described [7].
Control pLKOcontains a scrambled sequence previously
described [7]. The CDK mutants D90 [17] and R170
vectors [54] have been previously described. pEIZ vector
was generously donated from Dr. B. Welm (Univ. of Utah).
The creation of pEIZ-Spy1 was completed by inserting
Spy1 oligo into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pEIZ.

8000 cells were seeded in fully supplemented growth
media in 96-well plates for 2 hours. Cells were starved by
removing serum and penicillin/streptomycin from the media,
followed by the use of 1 mg/ml polybrene (Santa Cruz, sc134220) and MOI 3 of the specific vector used. Infected
media was changed to fully supplemented media 24 hours
after infection. For knockdown, cells were incubated with
1mg/ml puromycin (Sigma, P8833) 48 hours after infection
for 72 hours to allow for puromycin selection. Media is
thereafter changed every 48hours with puromycin included.

Inhibition treatments

Whole cell lysates were prepared as described
previously [12] and aliquots of lysates containing 100 µg
protein were subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing 10%
SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF-Plus
0.45 micron transfer membrane (Osmonics Inc.) for 2 hours
at 30 volts using a wet transfer method. Chemiluminescent
Peroxidase Substrate was used for visualization following
manufacturer’s instruction (Pierce). Chemiluminescence
was quantified on an AlphaInnotech HD2 (Fisher) using
AlphaEase FC software.

HEK-293 cells were seeded equally in 10 cm dishes
at a density of 5 × 105 cells. Upon 80% confluency, HEK293 cells were incubated with either 10 µM SB202474
(control; EMD Millipore, 559387) or 10 µM U0126
(MEK 1/2; EMD Millipore, 662005) inhibitors for 1 hour.
For Raf inhibition, 5 µM GW5074 (Sigma, G6416) was
added to the cells for 24 hours. For Ras inhibition, 20 µM
Farnesyl Thiosalicyclic Acid (Santa Cruz, sc-205322) was
added to the cells for 24 hours. For ERK1/2 inhibition,
10 µM SCH772984 (ApexBio, A3805) was added to the
cells for 1 hour prior to treatment with tamoxifen (Sigma,
H7904) for 24 hours. Following drug treatment, cells were
either analyzed using trypan blue analysis or pelleted,
lysed and analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE.

Antibodies

Estradiol treatments

Actin was purchased from Chemicon-Millipore
(MAB150 1R). Spy1 was purchased from ThermoScientific
(PA5-29417). c-Myc (9E10, C3956)and secondary rabbit
and mouse antibodies were purchased from Sigma.
Phospho-ERα-S118 (ab32396), Cyclin E1 (ab33911),
phospho-Raf1 (ab135559), p27 (ab7961), anti-ERK1
(phospho T202) + ERK2 (phospho T185) (ab201015),
and anti-ERK1 (phospho Y204) + ERK2 (phospho Y187)

MCF7 were seeded equally in 10 cm dishes at
a density of 5 × 105 cells. Upon 70% confluency, the
cells were treated with phenol red-free RPMI media,
supplemented with 10% charcoal treated FBS and 30,000
units penicillin/streptomycin. After 48 hours, cells were
incubated with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or
50 ng/ml E2 (Sigma, E8875) for specified time points,

Implantation and treatment

R-MF acknowledges scholarship support from the
Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. JT was supported by
a Mitacs Accelerate Studentship. This study was supported
by operating funds from the Canadian Institutes of Health
Research (CIHR) #142189.

Eggs were collected after fertilization and kept in
E3 embryo media (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mMKCl, 0.33 mM
CaCl2, 0.33mM MgSO4, 10–5% Methylene Blue) at 32°C in
an incubator until ready to inject. Before injection 200,000
cells were reconstituted in 200 µL of serum-free media and
labelled with 1 µL of DiO (green) (Vybrant, Invitrogen)
at 37°C for 20 minutes. Cells were washed with 200 µL
of serum free media twice and resuspended in 20 µL of
serum free media, kept at 37°C for 20 minutes, and placed
on ice until injection. 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf)
the embryos were dechorionated with fine tip forceps
and anesthetised with 0.168 mg/ml of Tricaine (Sigma,
MS222). 50–100 labelled cells/ 9 nL were loaded into
glass capillary needles and injected into the yolk sac of
each embryo using a Nanoject II (Fisher Scientific). After
injection, embryos were placed in E3 embryo media and 2
hours post-implantation (hpi) were examined using a Leica
fluorescence stereoscope to exclude any embryo with cells
outside of the implantation area. Mortalities due to injection
will also be evident at this time point for exclusion (~5–
15%). 24 hpi (0 hours post-treatment (hpt)) the embryos
were anesthetized, imaged and placed in a 96-well plate;
one embryo per well. At 48 hpi the embryos were treated
with either DMSO or 10 µM tamoxifen. The embryos were
imaged at 0 hpt and 24 hpt and the fold change in tumour
foci were quantified by total fluorescence.

Image analysis
The fish were imaged before and after treatment with
Tamoxifen and DMSO. The image for each embryo was
imported into ImageJ, the image was converted to a 32-bit
greyscale, and the threshold was adjusted to eliminate
background pixels. Total area of fluorescence was measured
as the tumour area and the ‘particle analysis’ function was
used to calculate number of tumour foci. Using automated
software we aligned the site of injection over multiple fish
to determine overall changes in the distance that tumour
foci are detected from injection site. All measured results
were copied into Excel files and fold change in tumour area
and tumour foci calculated from 24 to 72 hpi.
