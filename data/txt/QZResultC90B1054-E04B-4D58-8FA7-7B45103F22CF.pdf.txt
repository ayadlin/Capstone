Practical Management of Patients With
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Francisco Cervantes, MD, PhD1 and Michael Mauro, MD2

Although imatinib has been used as frontline therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for nearly a decade,
current debate is focused on the incorporation of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) at diagnosis in light of
recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of nilotinib and dasatinib for initial therapy in chronic-phase
CML. Articles were identified through a PubMed search and a review of abstracts from relevant hematology congresses. Additional information was provided from the authors’ libraries and expertise. With several therapies
now available, it is crucial to carefully define and monitor response in patients with CML to determine whether
their treatment is appropriate and is providing an optimal outcome. Different patterns of response to TKI
treatment have been recognized, ranging from best-case scenarios of rapid and unwavering response to difficult situations of intolerance and resistance, either primary or secondary. Patients who develop resistance
to imatinib are advised to switch to second-generation TKIs. Although specific mutations in the breakpoint
cluster region–v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL) kinase domain may guide treatment
selection in such scenarios, the choice is driven by other factors in the majority of patients, including the toxicity

KEYWORDS: imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, chronic myeloid leukemia, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Imatinib mesylate, a selective breakpoint cluster region‥v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL)
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been a model for the use of targeted therapies in cancer treatment; however, as more
treatment options have become available, a paradigm shift has emerged in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) in chronic phase (CML-CP). Increasing weight is placed on the degree of response, and specific categories of
response are defined in consensus recommendations.1,2 Toxicity is scrutinized more carefully, and acceptance of lowgrade, chronic toxicity has diminished.
Recent CML treatment recommendations have incorporated the use of the second-generation TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ) and dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,
Princeton, NJ) into their algorithms.2 Emerging data from the use of nilotinib and dasatinib in the frontline treatment of
patients with newly diagnosed CML already have changed the standard of care for CML for the future,3,4 and more
change is coming. The objective of this review was to aid physicians’ navigation of treatment options, with a goal that was
not conceptualized previously using nontransplantation therapy for patients with CML-CP: providing patients a normal
lifespan with the best possible quality of life.
Imatinib as Initial Therapy for Newly Diagnosed CML
Imatinib was approved in 2002 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for frontline use in patients with CML
based on early results from the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) trial, which demonstrated higher response rates and better tolerability for imatinib versus interferon plus low-dose cytarabine.5 The risk of
progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis (AP/BC) was greatest in the first 3 years of treatment (approximately 3.3% at
18 months)5 and decreased with longer follow-up (<1% after 4 years).6

Monitoring and Definitions of Response
Consensus recommendations support ongoing, regular
monitoring of patients with CML-CP who receive treatment with TKIs (Table 1).1,2 Cytogenetic studies performed with chromosome banding analysis (CBA) of
bone marrow cell metaphases are recommended at 3
months, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter until
patients achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR).
Bone marrow CBA is preferable to fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), because standard definitions of
cytogenetic response are based on CBA, and FISH cannot
detect additional chromosomal abnormalities. Molecular
monitoring is the most sensitive means of detecting residual disease,7 and real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RQ-PCR) is recommended at diagnosis, every 3
months until patients achieve a major molecular response
(MMR) (measured as the ratio of BCR-ABL/control gene
0.1% according to the International Scale), and every 6
months thereafter for follow-up. Because of its increased
sensitivity, RQ-PCR is preferable to FISH for monitoring
response after achieving a CCyR. However, FISH analysis
of peripheral blood using dual probes for the BCR and
ABL genes can be done if RQ-PCR is not available.
The recent update of the European LeukemiaNet
(ELN) recommendations reflects the robust responses
observed in most patients who receive imatinib and
presents more stringent definitions of optimal response,
suboptimal response, and failure than the previous recommendations from 2006 (Table 2).2,8 In addition, provisional definitions for suboptimal response and failure for
nilotinib or dasatinib as second-line therapy are provided

4344

and continue to be scrutinized.2 In fact, in a recent posthoc analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes
according to ELN response criteria in imatinib-resistant
or imatinib-intolerant patients who received second-line
nilotinib, few patients were considered suboptimal responders to nilotinib at 3 months and 6 months according
to the current ELN criteria, and PFS rates at 12 months
and 24 months did not differ significantly from the rates
among patients who had treatment failure.9 At 12
months, more patients were categorized as suboptimal responders, but PFS rates at 24 months were not statistically
different between these patients and those who had better
than suboptimal responses. These findings suggest that
further refinement of the criteria used to define responses
to second-line TKIs is warranted using longer term follow-up data from second-line and frontline trials with
these agents.
Although the achievement of a CCyR is an important short-term goal of CML therapy, reaching lower
transcript levels of BCR-ABL offers further protection
from progression and ultimately may improve long-term
event-free survival.10 Thus, patients who achieve an
MMR and maintain it appear to derive the greatest clinical benefit from treatment.7
Minor fluctuations in BCR-ABL transcript levels
are common in many patients and are not necessarily
cause for major concern. Most patients in CCyR who experience a rise in BCR-ABL transcript levels will remain
in stable CCyR,11,12 although the risk of progression is
greatest among patients who lost or never achieved an
MMR and experienced a >1-log increase in BCR-ABL

who lose or never achieved MMR and have a 1-log or
greater increase in transcript levels, and additional testing
(bone marrow CBA, mutation testing) can be considered
in these patients.
Long-Term Management of Imatinib
Responders
The current paradigm for imatinib responders, which is
fairly unique in cancer therapy, is indefinite, continual therapy. However, the depth and stability of observed responses
to imatinib (including complete molecular response
[CMR], typically defined as the absence of detectable
BCR-ABL transcripts) led to investigations into the possibility of treatment discontinuation. In the prospective Stop
Imatinib study, in which imatinib was discontinued in
patients with CML-CP who had a well documented, stable

Cancer

October 1, 2011

CMR (>2 years; N ¼ 100), approximately 61% of patients
relapsed after discontinuation, usually within 6 to 7
months.13 Although disease response was regained in most
patients after the reintroduction of imatinib, uncertainty
remains regarding the quality of the response regained. The
long-term impact of temporary loss of response is unknown
and needs further clarification. Consequently, discontinuation of TKI therapy is not recommended outside of clinical
trials but remains an active area of research.
Newer TKIs in the Second-Line and
Frontline Settings
Imatinib resistance and intolerance

Despite the striking benefits of imatinib, 34% of
patients who were randomized to receive imatinib in the
IRIS trial had discontinued therapy for several reasons at
6 years follow-up.14 Significant numbers of these discontinuations were related to inadequate response, and some
were related to adverse drug effects.

Both nilotinib and dasatinib have demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity against most BCR-ABL mutations that induce resistance to imatinib, typically defined
as failure to achieve a complete hematologic response
(CHR) after 3 months, a cytogenetic response after 6
months, a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) after 12
months, or loss of hematologic or cytogenetic response on
treatment.15 However, mutations at position T315I cause
definitive resistance to all 3 approved TKIs.
For patients with the T315I mutation for whom
stem cell transplantation (SCT) is not possible because of
risk to the patient or lack of an appropriate donor, patients
should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials.
Among the promising new therapies are omacetaxine
mepesuccinate, a cephalotaxine ester that has demonstrated
activity in patients with CML who carry the T315I mutation.16 AP24534 (ponatinib) is an oral multikinase inhibitor with activity against wild-type and mutated ABL
(particularly the T315I mutation) and has also demonstrated activity in heavily pretreated patients.17 A phase 2
study of AP24534 was initiated in September 2010.
Second-generation TKIs

Both nilotinib and dasatinib have been approved by
the FDA for patients with CML resistance to or intolerance of imatinib (nilotinib for CML-CP and CML-AP

4346

and dasatinib for all phases of CML), and both have
recently gained approval for frontline use in CML-CP.
Bosutinib failed to meet its primary endpoint (superior
CCyR at 12 months vs imatinib) in a randomized trial of
newly diagnosed patients18; however, it did demonstrate
superior MMR at 12 months and likely will be submitted
in 2011 for regulatory approval in the European Union
for newly diagnosed patients and in the United States for
patients who have failed on previous therapies.
Nilotinib

In single-arm phase 2 trials in imatinib-resistant or
imatinib-intolerant patients, both nilotinib (400 mg twice
daily) and dasatinib (70 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily,
depending on CML phase) induced high and durable rates
of hematologic and cytogenetic responses (Table 3).22-27
After favorable results were obtained in 2 pilot studies,28,29 nilotinib was tested in the phase 3 Evaluating
Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials—Newly
Diagnosed Patients (ENESTnd) registration study, which
evaluated nilotinib at 2 different doses (300 mg or
400 mg twice daily) versus imatinib (400 mg once daily)
in previously untreated patients. Initial data from
ENESTnd demonstrated rapid achievement of deep
responses on nilotinib and confirmed the superiority of
nilotinib over imatinib in the frontline setting (Table 4).3

Nilotinib and dasatinib data are from independent trials and cannot be directly compared.
b
Cumulative BCR-ABL was measured according to the IS based on the ratio of BCR-ABL to a control gene.
c
The median treatment duration was 14 months.
d
The median treatment duration was 18.6 months for nilotinib 300 mg BID, 18.5 months for nilotinib 400 mg BID, 18.1 months for imatinib, and 18 months for
both arms of the DASISION trial.

It is noteworthy that, at the early time in therapy when progression on imatinib is highest, patients who received nilotinib had a significant improvement in the time to
progression to advanced disease. Nilotinib treatment generally was well tolerated, and rates of discontinuation were
lowest on the nilotinib 300 mg twice-daily arm. These
superior response rates and progression advantage were
maintained with at a minimum follow-up of 24 months.33
Dasatinib

In a dose optimization study of patients with CMLCP who were intolerant of or resistant to imatinib, dasatinib at 100 mg once daily (n ¼ 165) had comparable efficacy and more favorable safety compared with the 3 other
arms (70 mg twice daily [n ¼ 167], 140 mg once daily
[n ¼ 163], and 50 mg twice daily [n ¼ 167]).25 Results
from that study led to the acceptance of 100 mg once daily
as the recommended dose for dasatinib in patients with

Cancer

October 1, 2011

CML-CP.38 For CML-AP and CML-BC and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia,
the recommended starting dose is 140 mg once daily.38
After promising results from a phase 2 trial,39 100
mg once-daily dasatinib was compared with 400 mg oncedaily imatinib in the phase 3 randomized Dasatinib Versus
Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive CML Patients (DASISION) study. The 12-month4 and 18-month32 data from
the DASISION trial demonstrated superior responses with
dasatinib (Table 4). Rates of discontinuation were similar
for dasatinib-treated and imatinib-treated patients, and
both drugs were generally well tolerated. Longer term data
from those randomized nilotinib and dasatinib clinical
studies are needed to confirm the initial findings.
AEs Associated With TKIs
Common toxicities with imatinib generally are mild to
moderate and tend to cluster early (range, 0-18 months)

4347

Review Article

during imatinib therapy.6 There also are limited numbers of
higher grade toxicities, such as myelosuppression, that are
linked to early response kinetics and disease severity. Therapy
with nilotinib or dasatinib also generally is well tolerated.
Similar patterns of toxicity are noted across the TKIs, but toxicities unique to each agent (likely related to target kinase profiles) have been recognized and present new considerations.
Dasatinib inhibits c-Kit and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) with greater potency than imatinib or nilotinib and also inhibits the Src family kinases.40
Src kinases are critical mediators of hematopoiesis,41 and Src
inhibition also may relate to higher rates of myelosuppression. Serosal inflammation (including pericardial and pleural effusion) frequently associated with dasatinib may be
related to PDGFR beta or Src inhibition41 or to immunemediated effects.42 For example, some dasatinib-treated
patients have elevated levels of CD8-positive, natural killer
(NK)-like, and NKT-like cells in the peripheral blood43;
and dasatinib-related lymphocytosis has been associated
with increased incidence of pleural effusion.44 However,
dasatinib-induced lymphocytosis also has been associated
with increased response44 and prolonged survival,45 suggesting that dasatinib-induced immune reactivity may be associated with good clinical outcomes in some patients.
Nilotinib and, to a lesser extent, imatinib induce an
increase in the serum concentration of pancreatic enzymes
in a significant percentage of patients.3 However, radiographic/clinical pancreatitis has been noted rarely with
these drugs, and the relevance of this asymptomatic effect is
unknown. Grade 3/4 hyperglycemia also occurs in a subset
of patients who receive nilotinib, although no correlation
between hyperglycemia and response to nilotinib has been
reported, and hyperglycemia does not typically lead to
treatment discontinuation. Hyperbilirubinemia is observed
in some nilotinib-treated patients, generally occurs early
after nilotinib initiation, and may be more prominent in
patients with certain hepatic cytochrome p450 genotypes.46 Hypophosphatemia is observed with both nilotinib
and imatinib47,48 and is correctable with supplementation.
In fact, it has been demonstrated that imatinib promotes
bone mineralization,49 so the clinical significance of this
adverse event (AE) is unknown. Skin rash also is a prominent side effect of nilotinib therapy.3,22 Rashes tend to
emerge at the beginning of treatment but typically are moderate and tend to improve/resolve spontaneously.
Hematologic AEs

Myelosuppression events are the most frequent and
likely AEs to alter treatment course and dose intensity

4348

across all of the TKIs for CML (Table 5). Severe (grade 3/4)
cytopenias are more common in imatinib-treated
patients with CML-AP,35,36 and myelosuppression is not
observed significantly in imatinib-treated patients who
have gastrointestinal stromal tumors,50,51 suggesting that
myelosuppression may be linked directly to underlying
CML disease.
Hematologic AEs are more prominent in secondline therapy compared with frontline imatinib therapy.
However, cross-intolerance studies have demonstrated
that myelosuppression may be carried over from imatinib
to dasatinib/nilotinib,52,53 indicating that disease biology
and response are significant contributors to myelosuppression. Subset analyses suggest that patients who received
nilotinib experienced less cross-hematologic intolerance to
imatinib than patients who received with dasatinib.52,53
Myelosuppression rates were substantially lower in trials
of newly diagnosed patients receiving nilotinib or dasatinib,3,4,28,29,54 as would be expected if hematologic toxicity
is related to intrinsic disease-related factors, such as duration of diagnosis and exposure to previous therapies. In
general, dasatinib is associated with higher rates of myelosuppression compared with imatinib or nilotinib.3,4 To
minimize morbidity and properly manage all TKI-induced
cytopenias, careful hematologic monitoring is required and
should be performed a minimum of every 2 weeks in
patients with CML-CP early during therapy. Strategies for
managing toxicity should include treatment interruption
if needed and dose reduction upon restart of therapy if
myelosuppression is severe or unrelenting.

Gastrointestinal symptoms

Nausea is among the most common side effects in
patients who receive imatinib. It occurred in 50% to 73%
of patients in all disease stages who received 400 to 600
mg of imatinib daily.48 Nausea is usually grade 1, and the
severity is related somewhat to dosage.55 Diarrhea also is
relatively common; and, although it can be managed with
antidiarrheal medication, lower grade chronic toxicity of
this nature can impair quality of life and may warrant consideration of switching therapy.55 Upper gastrointestinal
symptoms (heartburn, nausea, etc) may be alleviated if
imatinib is taken with sufficient food and water.
Nausea and diarrhea are less common in patients
who receive nilotinib and dasatinib.3,4 Nilotinib must be
given on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours after eating
any food); and, after taking nilotinib, the patient should
wait at least 1 hour before eating any food, because

absorption is altered if it is administered with food.47
Dasatinib can be taken with or without food.38
Edema and pleural effusions

Mild, superficial edema is a very common toxicity
with imatinib, whereas severe edema resulting in pleural
or pericardial effusions is rare.48 Edema most commonly
is periorbital and requires no treatment. Decrease in
sodium intake and diuretics may reduce symptoms and
improve cosmesis in some patients. With generalized
edema and peripheral edema, diuretics and/or compression/elevation therapy generally are recommended. In
severe cases, imatinib interruption may be necessary with
ongoing diuretic therapy until symptoms are controlled.
Pleural or pericardial effusions are exceedingly uncommon on nilotinib, and their incidence was 1% in the
phase 2 registration trial for nilotinib.22
Dasatinib, conversely, is known to cause pleural
effusions as well as other fluid-retention syndromes; and
identification, frequency and etiology, and management
of this toxicity have been highlighted during the drug’s
development. In the dose-optimization study, 100 mg
once-daily dosing was associated with less pleural effusion

Cancer

(14%) than 70 mg twice daily (23%).25 Recognition of
this AE has prompted more screening and potentially
increased the number of lower grade events noted in clinical practice. An association has been made between the
occurrence of this toxicity and certain comorbidities, such
as hypertension, cardiac disease, hypercholesterolemia,
autoimmune disease, and skin rash.56,57 In addition, levels
of brain natriuretic peptide, a marker of congestive heart
failure, reportedly were elevated in most patients on dasatinib who had grade 3/4 pleural effusions.57 Effusions
often can be managed by an ongoing combination of diuretics, temporary drug discontinuation, dose reduction, or
short courses of systemic steroids.
Cardiac events

Kerkela et al reported clinical findings of left ventricular contractile dysfunction accompanied by signs and
symptoms of heart failure in 10 patients with CML after
imatinib therapy.58 In large meta-analyses, no clear
increase in heart failure was observed in imatinib-treated
patients above the expected baseline incidence in agematched, non-CML cohorts.59-61 A recent preclinical
analysis also demonstrated that imatinib does not induce

4349

Review Article

cardiotoxicity in vitro or in animal models at clinically relevant concentrations.62 Thus, imatinib does not appear to
be associated with deterioration of cardiac function.
High-risk patients should be monitored every 3 to 6
months to measure heart function. Underlying conditions
that could lead to heart failure should be reversed or
treated optimally to maximize clinical benefit.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that nilotinib
does effect cardiac repolarization. Careful monitoring of
the QT interval was integrated into phase 2 nilotinib
clinical trials. Overall, fewer than 1% of patients had QT
prolongation >500 msec, and 2.1% had prolongation
60 msec over baseline.47 Five sudden deaths were noted,
and the possibility that ventricular repolarization played a
role could not be excluded, leading to a boxed warning on
the nilotinib label regarding the potential for QT prolongation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is required
before the initiation of nilotinib to screen for pre-existing
QT changes and to establish a baseline. The ECG should
then be repeated 7 days after initiation of nilotinib therapy, and additional ECGs can be performed at regular
intervals or if any dose changes are made.
In the ENESTnd trial, nilotinib at both doses had a
favorable cardiac safety profile comparable to that of imatinib, with no incidence of QTcF >500 msec on any arm
and no decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction with a
median treatment duration of 14 months.3 Although
QT prolongation was observed at similar rates with
dasatinib therapy (<1% of patients experienced a QTcF
>500 msec, and 3% had a QTcF increase from baseline
>60 msec),63 ECG studies are not mandated in its label.
Bleeding

It has been reported that dasatinib inhibits platelet
aggregation.64 Episodes of bleeding were observed in
approximately 25% of patients who received dasatinib
after imatinib failure and were grade 3/4 in 10% of episodes.65 These bleeding events often were associated with
thrombocytopenia, but approximately 30% of patients
had normal platelet counts.65 Bleeding in the absence of
thrombocytopenia is not common with other TKIs, such
as imatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib.65 Patients with a history of serious bleeding events were excluded from the
dasatinib frontline trial, and gastrointestinal or other
bleeding events occurred at a lower rate in that population
(in 13 patients who received dasatinib [5%] and in 12
patients who received imatinib [5%]).4 Patients who
develop bleeding on dasatinib or another TKI should discontinue therapy immediately.

Treatment of Specific Subpopulations
TKIs are safe in elderly patients and have efficacy comparable to that observed with TKIs in younger patients.66-68
In general, elderly patients should receive TKIs according
to the same guidelines and expectations that apply to
younger patients, with appropriate attention to comorbidities and concomitant medications. TKIs also are
becoming an increasingly important option in children
for whom SCT is less viable. In addition, TKI therapy
may allow for a calculated delay and, thus, permit
the achievement of developmental milestones before
SCT.69,70 TKIs should be avoided in pregnant women
because there has been preclinical evidence of fetal
risk.38,47,48 Pregnant patients may undergo leukapheresis,
and interferon can be used after the first trimester. New
ELN recommendations support the discontinuation of
imatinib in women who plan to become pregnant and
have achieved a major molecular response,2 because the
quality of the remission gained before discontinuation
likely dictates rapidity and severity of relapse.71
Current Role of Allogeneic SCT
Although SCT is a potentially curative treatment for
patients with CML, favorable long-term outcomes with
imatinib and promising early data with second-generation
TKIs have challenged the role of SCT in CML therapy.
Alternatively, advances in other donor sources and less
toxic regimens could broaden the availability of SCT.
Recommendations for the use of SCT recently were
updated2; and indications include advanced disease, presence of the T315I mutation, and failure on imatinib and
second-generation TKIs. The optimal use of SCT in
CML remains relative to disease phase (with better outcomes reported in early CML phase) and depends on careful timing and identification of patients for whom TKI
therapy is no longer an appropriate strategy, namely, those
who have failed on imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. In
good candidates for SCT (in practice, young patients with
a suitable donor), transplantation can be considered after
failing imatinib and 1 second-generation TKI.
Proposed Treatment Algorithm for the
Management of Patients With CML
With the recent approval of nilotinib and dasatinib by the
US FDA as frontline treatment and the demonstrated superiority of these agents compared with imatinib in
randomized clinical trials,3,4 it is reasonable to consider
starting a newly diagnosed patient on nilotinib or dasatinib. The choice between nilotinib and dasatinib should be

Cancer

determined by safety profiles and patient history. Severe,
uncontrolled diabetes and past pancreatitis are considered
risk factors for nilotinib use, although most biochemical
laboratory abnormalities in nilotinib-treated patients are
transient, asymptomatic, and not clinically relevant.
Patients with a history of hypertension, asthma, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest wall injury, congestive heart failure,
autoimmune disorders, or concomitant aspirin use may be
more susceptible to the pleural and pericardial effusions,
bleeding, and infection risks associated with dasatinib.
Optimal responders should continue therapy indefinitely. Dose escalation to 600 mg or 800 mg daily reportedly was effective and safe in suboptimal responders to
imatinib,72 although an early switch to nilotinib or dasatinib may be a better choice for most patients because of the
demonstrated superiority of these agents to standard-dose
imatinib in clinical trials3,4 versus the lack of superiority
of 800 mg to 400 mg daily imatinib demonstrated in a
randomized trial.73 In addition, MMR rates at 12 months
were higher on the Trial of Initial Intensified Imatinib
Therapy and Sequential Dose-Escalation-II (TIDEL-II)
study,74 in which patients who failed to achieve specific
molecular milestones after dose escalation were switched
to nilotinib, than MMR rates on the TIDEL-I study,
which used only imatinib dose escalation for suboptimal
responders, suggesting that early switch to a second-generation TKI may be preferable in suboptimal responders.
Randomized trials currently are underway to investigate
this important question.
Suboptimal response to second-generation TKIs is
not clearly defined; and, as mentioned above, current
ELN guidelines probably need to be refined as more data
become available on these agents. Treatment with these
agents should be continued until loss of hematologic or
cytogenetic response or intolerance, at which point
switching to the alternate TKI should be considered.
In patients currently receiving imatinib who develop
intolerance or resistance, switching to an alternative TKI
is recommended (except for patients with T315I mutation). In patients with the T315I mutation, SCT or clinical trials should be considered. In the majority of
imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with no mutation or
with a mutation that is sensitive to both second-generation TKIs, safety profiles and patient history should be
considered when choosing a second-line therapy. If the
patient has 1 of the few mutations with resistance to only
1 of the second-generation TKIs (Y253H, E255K/V,
and F359C/V for nilotinib75; V299L and F317L for dasa-

Cancer

tinib76), then the other TKI is recommended, assuming
that safety and patient-specific conditions are taken into
consideration.
In conclusion, the treatment of CML has been revolutionized by the advent of TKI therapy. Although longterm data continue to affirm the safety and efficacy of
imatinib, recent data from the ENESTnd and DASISION studies demonstrating the superiority of nilotinib3
and dasatinib4 compared with imatinib in the frontline
treatment of CML-CP have resulted in acceptance by the
FDA of the second-generation TKI nilotinib as the new
standard of care for frontline therapy in CML. The FDA
decision regarding the frontline indication for dasatinib is
expected later. For all TKIs that are used in CML, management of AEs and dose adjustments if necessary are critical with the goal of optimizing patients’ quality of life
and maximizing adherence to therapy, because the uninterrupted maintenance strategy currently used for TKI
therapy in CML is increasingly likely to provide patients
with a normal lifespan. With growing treatment options,
matching the right agent with the right patient/clinical
scenario will be essential with the eventual goal of a ‘‘cure’’
for patients with CML.
