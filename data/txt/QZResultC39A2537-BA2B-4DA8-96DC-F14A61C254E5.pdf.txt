ABSTRACT
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive, incurable disease, characterized by
a deregulated cell cycle. Chk1 and Wee1 are main regulators of cell cycle progression
and recent data on solid tumors suggest that simultaneous inhibition of these
proteins has a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect. The effects of a Chk1 inhibitor
(PF-00477736) and a Wee1 inhibitor (MK-1775) have been herein investigated in a
large panel of mature B-cell lymphoma cell lines. We found that MCL cells were the
most sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 and Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 as
single agents. Possible involvement of the translocation t(11;14) in Chk1 inhibitor
sensitivity was hypothesized. The combined inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 was strongly
synergistic in MCL cells, leading to deregulation of the cell cycle, with increased
activity of CDK2 and CDK1, and activation of apoptosis. In vivo treatment with the
drug combination of mice bearing JeKo-1 xenografts (MCL) had a marked antitumor
effect with tumor regressions observed at non-toxic doses (best T/C%=0.54%).
Gene expression profiling suggested effect on genes involved in apoptosis. The strong
synergism observed by combining Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors in preclinical models of
MCL provides the rationale for testing this combination in the clinical setting.

cycle is the characteristic pathogenic hallmark of MCL.
The presence of the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation,
which leads to the constitutive expression of the CCND1
gene, encoding cyclin D1, is virtually present in all the
cases [1, 3]. The disease is also characterized by frequent
additional genetic lesions deregulating genes, such as
CDKN2A, CDK4, TP53 and ATM, involved in cell cycle
regulation and DNA damage response [7, 8]. In normal
cells genomic stability and integrity is assured by the
existence of surveillance pathways that control key
processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints,
apoptosis and transcription [9, 10]. The checkpoint kinases
Chk1 and Wee1 are key regulators of DNA damage

INTRODUCTION
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is one of the most
common lymphoma subtypes, accounting for 5–10%
of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas [1], and its prognosis
is the worst among B-cell lymphomas [2, 3]. MCL is
considered non curable with current therapies due to often
incomplete response to initial chemotherapy and early
relapse and, thus, more effective therapeutic approaches
are needed [4]. The strongest prognostic markers in MCL
are related to proliferation including Ki-67 staining by
immunohistochemistry and a specific gene expression
proliferation signature [5, 6]. Indeed deregulation of cell

surveillance pathways [11–13]. Chk1 regulates the S and
G2 checkpoints, replication initiation and replication
fork stability [12, 14, 15]. Wee1 has a major cell cycle
function in control of the G2/M transition and in ensuring
faithful DNA replication [11, 12, 16]. Chk1 and Wee1
are required during normal S phase to avoid deleterious
DNA breakage, and prevent loss of genome integrity in
the absence of exogenous DNA damage [11, 17–19].
Experimental evidence has identified Wee1 in synthetic
lethality with Chk1 [13, 20] and combined treatment with
Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors showed a strong synergistic
cytotoxic effect in various human solid tumors cell lines
[13, 20–22]. Little is known about the putative role and
effects of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors in lymphomas.
We herein performed a cytotoxic screening in
35 B-cell lymphoma cell lines with Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors. MCL were the lymphoma cell lines most
sensitive to Chk1 and to a lesser extent to Wee1 inhibition.
Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors were then combined leading to
a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect, affecting cell cycle
and apoptosis. The combined treatment also resulted in
strong antitumor activity in MCL xenografts in vivo. We
provide the first preclinical evidence of Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors as new therapeutic approach in MCL, which
warrants investigation in a clinical setting.

Similar results were obtained by treating this panel
of cell lines with another Chk1 inhibitor, AZD-7762
(Supplementary Figure 1B and C). Since MCL appeared
the most sensitive to both compounds, we then focused on
this lymphoma type.

Sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition is associated with
a high cell proliferation signature and with the
presence of t(11;14)
To identify the biologic features determining the
highest sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition in lymphomas,
we compared the baseline gene expression profiling
of 21 of the most sensitive cell lines to PF-00477736
(IC50 < 25 nM) versus the five most resistant cell lines
(IC50 > 150 nM). The gene expression profiles of sensitive
cell lines appeared significantly enriched of gene-sets
involved in cell proliferation (Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 2). This was true also when we
limited the analysis to DLBCL cell lines only (data not
shown). In accordance with a higher sensitivity of GCBDLBCL than ABC-DLBCL, germinal center-associated
gene-sets were also enriched in the transcripts higher
in the sensitive cell lines, while NFKB and JAK/STATrelated gene-sets were enriched in the gene expression
profiles of the resistant cell lines (Supplementary Table 1).
Since cell proliferation signatures were associated
with a higher sensitivity to Chk1-inhibition and since
MCL is the only lymphoma bearing the t(11;14)(q13;q32)
[1] that leads to an increased activation of the CDK/
cyclins involved in G1-S transition [4], we next asked if
the deregulation of the cyclin D1 might be correlated with
the high sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitor. As expected, cyclin
D1 was constitutively expressed in the ten MCL cell lines,
while not detectable in other hematological cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 3). To further investigate the
possible role of the t(11;14) in Chk1 inhibitor sensitivity,
we selected MM cell lines, with or without the t(11;14),
and treated them with Chk1 inhibitor. KMS12BM and
U266 cell lines displaying the t(11;14) and overexpressing
cyclin D1 (Supplementary Figure 4B) were much more
sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor compared to the KMS11,
RPMI8226 and OPM2 cell lines not harboring the t(11;14)
translocation (Supplementary Figure 4A). In fact, the
PF-00477736 mean and median IC50 were at least 40
times lower in cells with the translocation than in cells
without (Supplementary Figure 4C). These data suggest
that the t(11;14) may be positively correlated with the
strong sensitivity of MCL cell lines to Chk1 inhibitors.
In order to better elucidate if the high activity of the
CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex is involved in the sensitivity
to such inhibitor, we performed a combined treatment of
PF-00477736 with a selective inhibitor of the CDK4/6cyclin D1 complex (PD-0332991) [23] in JeKo-1 cell line.
Figure 2A shows the effect of Chk1 inhibitor treatment
in the presence of different non toxic concentrations of

RESULTS
MCL cell lines display a high sensitivity to
Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors as single agents
We investigated the effects of Chk1 and Wee1
inhibition in a large panel of lymphoma cell lines:
35 mature B-cell lymphoma cell lines comprising ten
MCL and 25 DLBCL cell lines (seven ABC-DLBCL and
18 GCB-DLBCL), by treating them with specific Chk1
and Wee1 inhibitors, respectively PF-00477736 and MK1775. MCL cell lines were significantly more sensitive to
PF-0047736 and slightly more sensitive to MK-1775 as
compared to DLBCL cell lines (Figure 1A). The median
IC50 value for PF-00477736 was 0.68 nM in MCL
cell lines, significantly lower than in DLBCL cell lines
(p = 0.0117). PF-00477736 IC50 values were significantly
lower in GCB-DLBCL (10.2 nM) than in ABC-DLBCL
(87.3 nM) (p = 0.029). The MK-1775 median IC50
in MCL cells was 55.5 nM, a value lower that the one
observed in DLBCL cell lines (p = 0.053) (Figure 1B).
We validated the results by treating these cell lines in a 96
well plate setting. Supplementary Figure 1A summarizes
IC50 values obtained in the panel of cell lines. Although
the absolute IC50 values were slightly higher than the ones
obtained in 384 well plates (especially for PF-00477736),
the MCL cell lines (black bars) were again more sensitive
to both drugs as compared to the DLBCL cells included
in the validation step (Supplementary Figure 1A and C).

PD-0332991, being importantly antagonized. Figure 2B
reports the CI values, having PD-0332991 a substantial
antagonistic effect (CI > 1) when combined with
PF-00477736. The results were confirmed, although
at a lesser extent, in another MCL cell line, UPN-1
(Figure 2B). A slight antagonism between PF-00477736
and PD-0332991 was confirmed in the MM cell line
KMS12BM with the translocation, but not in OPM2 cell
line without the translocation, thus corroborating the
hypothesis that this effect is limited to the t(11;14) positive
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 5). The concentrations of
PD-0332991 used inhibited the target of interest
(Figure  2C) and were not toxic, although a slight G1
block was observed after such treatment (data not shown).

These data partly suggest that the high activity of
CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex of these cells can explain
sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitors; we can not however
completely rule out that the little but consistent cell cycle
delay observed by treating with non toxic concentrations of
PD-00332991 could account for the antagonism observed.

Combination of PF-00477736 and MK-1775
is strongly synergistic in MCL cell lines
The effect of the combined treatment with Chk1 and
Wee1 inhibitors was then evaluated in all the ten MCL cell
lines. The isobologram in Figure 3A summarizes the CI
value of each cell line at an IC50 dose when the two drugs

were combined and clearly shows a synergistic effect
(CI < 1) in all the cell lines. Figure 3B schematically
presents the strong synergistic effect in JeKo-1 cells with
low drug concentrations. Decreased phosphorylation
in Y15 CDK1, pharmacodynamic parameter of Wee1
inhibition, [24] and increased phosphorylation in
S317 of Chk1, marker of Chk1 inhibition, [25] were
observed 24 hrs after such treatments, suggesting that
the concentrations of the two inhibitors used as single
agents, although not toxic, are effective in inhibiting their
targets (Figure 3C, upper part). A complete activation
of CDK1 and CDK2 (involved in control of replication
initiation and control of mitotic entry, respectively), was
only observed after 48 hrs of exposure to the combined
treatment (decrease in phosphorylation in Y15 of CDK2
and in Y15/T14 of CDK1) (Figure 3C, lower panel).
These data suggest that the combined treatment leads to a
general deregulation of the cell cycle.

We performed FACS analysis in JeKo-1 cells treated
for 24 and 48 hrs with the two drugs either individually or
combined at concentrations not toxic as single agents. No
cell cycle perturbation was observed after the single drugs,
while combined treatment caused slight accumulation
of cells in S phase with a DNA content between 2N
and 4N starting from 24 hrs (57.8% vs 45% in control,
47,2% in PF-00477736 and 46,4% in MK-1755 samples)
and persisting up to 48 hrs after treatment (57,8% vs
48% in control, 42, 5% in PF-0047736 and 45,3% in
MK-1775 samples) (Figure 4A). In samples treated with
the combination at both time points, there was an increase
in the sub G1 population suggesting the presence of an
apoptotic population. These data were corroborated by
the detection of caspase-3 activity in cells treated with the
two drugs, with values six times higher from 24 to 72 hrs
as compared to cells untreated or treated with the single
agents, and a return to basal levels by 120 hrs. (Figure 4B).

the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs [11, 16,
26, 27]. The role of both Chk1 and Wee1 in regulating
cell cycle progression in the absence of exogenous DNA
damage, by phosphorylating CDK1 and CDK2 and by
controlling DNA replication, is also an active area of
investigation [12, 27]. For both roles it is widely accepted
that the functions of Chk1 and Wee1 are distinct, since
co-depletion of the two proteins leads to more complete
hyper-activation of the two CDKs and to a more extensive
replication fork slowing than with inhibition of either
protein alone [13, 19]. The non redundant roles are
consistent with the in vitro and in vivo data collected on
the synergistic activity of combining Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors in solid tumors [13, 20–22] which was shown to
be specific for tumor cells, thus enhancing the therapeutic
potential of this combination [13, 20]. Little has been
reported about the activity of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors
in hematologic malignancies. We previously reported
a role of Chk1 in hematopoietic differentiation, with a
peculiar kinetic of Chk1 expression during this process,
showing a shift toward higher lymphoid differentiation
upon Chk1 inhibition [28]. Chk1 inhibitors have been
shown to be effective against mouse models Myc-driven
malignancies, such as B-cell lymphoma [29], and Wee1
inhibitors enhance the efficacy of the SRC inhibitors in
Burkitt lymphomas [30]. Moreover, both Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors sensitize AML cell lines to antimetabolites
chemotherapeutics, such as cytarabine, independently
from p53 [31, 32]. Recently a synergism between Chk1
and Wee1 inhibitors has been described in AML [33].
Here, we have explored the effects of Chk1 and
Wee1 inhibitors as single agents in a wide panel of B-cell
lymphomas. Our data clearly showed that, among all the
lymphoma cell lines, MCL cell lines are significantly
more sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 and,
even though to a lesser extent, more sensitive to the Wee1
inhibitor MK-1775. In addition, MCL cell lines were
10 and 6 times more sensitive to Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors,
respectively, than different epithelial carcinoma cell lines
[13]. Due to the high difference in range of sensitivity to
Chk1 inhibitor, we compared the baseline gene expression
profiles of the cell lines most sensitive to Chk1 inhibitor
with the most resistant ones among the entire panel of
B-cell lymphoma cell lines. While cell cycle-related genesets were associated with a higher sensitivity to the Chk1
inhibitor, the gene expression profiles of the most resistant
cell lines presented an enrichment in NFKB and JAKSTAT anti apoptotic and pro survival pathways. It is to
note that among the DLBCL cell lines, those derived from
the ABC subtype, characterized by activation of these
pathways [34], were less sensitive than the GCB-DLBCL
cell lines to PF-00477736. Studies are ongoing to better
investigate this different sensitivity.
Among MCL models, only one cell line (REC-1)
showed a clear resistance to PF-00477736. Although the
precise biological mechanisms of this resistance have
still to be elucidated, when compared to other MCL

Combined treatment has a strong
in vivo antitumor activity
The combination was tested in vivo in nude mice
bearing JeKo-1-MCL cell line. Oral MK-1775 (30 mg/kg
twice a day) and i.p. PF-00477736 (10 mg/kg once daily)
were given for 16 consecutive days alone or combined.
In addition, considering the striking cytotoxic activity
in vitro, we decided to treat a group of mice with the
combination at half the doses used as single agents
(15 and 5 mg/kg respectively). All these treatments
caused no significant body weight loss (Figure 5B). Even
though the tumor weight of the single treatments differed
significantly from control only on day 33, the antitumor
activity was negligible as suggested by the T/C% > 45%
and 60% respectively for the higher PF-00477736 and
MK-1775 dose schedule (Figure 5A). However, there
was a striking significant antitumor activity in mice
treated with the drug combination, with T/C% of 0.54%
at higher concentrations and of 28.43% at the lower
concentrations (Figure 5B). At the higher dose schedule
of combination, tumor regressions were observed and
maintained for all the duration of the treatment. Treatment
withdrawal was followed by tumor re-growth in all the
mice. When a second cycle of combination treatment was
given to the high dose combination group a less tumor
growth inhibition as compared to the first cycle could be
observed; in fact mainly tumor stabilization was observed
(Figure 5). Analysis on xenografts after three days of
treatment, showed that the targets were inhibited in vivo
by one or both drugs (at the higher doses) (Figure 5C),
and the treatments induced changes of transcripts that
were significantly enriched of genes coding for proteins
involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage
response (Figure 6A, Supplementary Tables 2–3). Based
on their known function, and on in vitro data of apoptosis
induced by the combination, we focused on four among
the ten most up-regulated genes in the first combination
cycle, involved in the mechanisms of apoptosis activation:
c-JUN, GADD45B, TNFAIP3 and NFKBI (Figure 6A).
These genes were validated by real time PCR,
confirming their increased expression compared to all
the other groups (Figure 6B). Additionally, there was a
six-fold increase in caspase-3 activity in samples from the
same experimental group as compared to the other ones
(Figure 6C), further corroborating the in vitro data of
induction of apoptosis by the combination.

DISCUSSION
In recent years the development of Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors has emerged as an effective strategy to potentiate

cell lines REC-1 appears more resistant to several drugs
(i.e. cisplatin, doxorubicin, cytarabine, gemcitabine) [35].
Here, mutational status of p53 and ATM did not seem to
be correlated to resistance, since REC-1 cell line displays
both p53 and ATM wt, similarly to one of the most
sensitive cell line, Z138.
We did not observe any correlation between
sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitor and the presence of a Mycgene expression signature, suggesting that the high
sensitivity to this class of compounds described in mouse
models of Myc-driven lymphomas [29] might depend
more on the deregulated cell cycle and DNA damage
repair mechanisms rather than on the deregulation of Myc
itself. The observed enrichment in cell proliferation and
cell cycle related genes signature in the most sensitive
cell lines matched with the association observed between
Chk1 inhibitor sensitivity and the derivation from MCL,
characterized by the presence of the t(11;14). A higher
cytotoxicity to Chk1 inhibitors was indeed also observed
in a panel of MM cell lines displaying the t(11;14) as
compared to those without the translocation. Moreover,
the inhibition of the CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex
activity, which in MCL cell lines is over-activated, with
PD-0332991 [23], partly neutralized the cytotoxic effect
of the Chk1 inhibitor. Modulation of cyclin D1 expression
could help in elucidating its role in sensitivity to such
treatments; we strenuously tried to downregulate cyclin
D1 by siRNA, but we were unsuccessful. The t(11;14)
deregulates the expression of CCND1 gene, leading to
increased activity of the CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which by phosphorylating Rb induces the release of E2F1
transcription factor and the consequent progression of
cells into S phase. In MCL and MM with the translocation
the control of G1-S transition is further impaired by the
increased activity of the CDK2-cyclin E complex related
to the CDK4-cyclin D1 dependent sequestration of its
inhibitor p27kip and by the frequent presence of CDK4
amplification and p16INK4 inactivation [4, 8, 36]. Taken
together, these molecular features suggest that MCL and
MM with the translocation may be even more dependent
on Chk1, being crucial in regulating entry in S phase and
in ensuring a correct DNA replication [12]. The sensitivity
to Wee1 inhibitor does not seem to be correlated with
the translocation in MM cell lines and is only slightly
antagonized by the treatment with PD-0332991 (data
not shown). The stronger dependence of MCL to Chk1
inhibitors than to Wee1 inhibitors may be linked to the fact
that, differently from Wee1, Chk1 not only controls CDK1
and CDK2 activity, but also indirectly controls CDK4
activity through the Cdc25A [37]. In addition, it has been
suggested that Chk1 has a major role in DNA repair by
regulating components of homologous recombination
repair pathways, involved in repair of double strand break
occurring during DNA replication defects [12, 38]. The
strong synergism observed with the drugs combination in
MCL cell lines with very low concentrations of the two
inhibitors, suggested that also in this experimental system
the two protein kinases have non redundant roles. The
simultaneous lack of the two main S phase progression

involved in S phase entry and render MCL unable to
tolerate the endogenous DNA damage developed during
DNA replication (Figure 7). These events may explain
the observed higher accumulation of cells in S phase after
the combined treatment, which may ultimately led to cell
death by apoptosis. The strong in vitro synergism also
translated to the in vivo setting. Tumor regressions were
observed only with the combination of Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors and not with the single agents. The outstanding
tumor growth inhibition (best T/C%: 0.54%) occurred at
half of the doses used in our previous in vivo experiment

in ovarian cancer xenografts [13]. The antitumor activity
observed in MCL xenografts with the combination
was stronger than the one observed in neuroblastoma
xenografts treated with MK-1775 and the Chk1 inhibitor
MK-8776, and comparable to what observed in colon
cancer xenografts, where MK-1775 was used at much
higher dose (50 mg/kg) [21, 22]. These observations
strongly suggest that MCL cells respond better than other
tumor models to the combination of Chk1 and Wee1
inhibitors. Activation of apoptosis was observed after
three days of combination treatment in vivo, but it was not

Figure 7: Model of Chk1 and Wee1 role in MCL and MM with t(11;14). (A) Cell lines with the chromosomal translocation

t(11;14), have an enhanced G1-S transition due to cyclin D1 constitutive expression and are more dependent on Chk1 and Wee1 function
since they are both crucial in control of initiation of DNA replication (1) and in the regulation of correct progression into S phase, minimizing
endogenous DNA damage (2). Our data suggest that MCL and MM with t(11;14) rely more on Chk1 than on Wee1 activity (see text).
(B) When both the kinases are inhibited cells undergo massive cell death because they lost the crucial protein kinases involved in control of
G1 –S transition (1) and in monitoring the correct progression through S phase (2). Our data indeed show that these experimental systems
are extremely susceptible to combined inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors at much lower concentrations than the ones used in other
experimental systems. The non redundant roles played by Chk1 and Wee1 in the functions above mentioned justify the higher activity of
the combination than the inhibitors used as single agents.

observed at the end of the second cycle of combination
treatment after which a lower effect of the combination
was observed. Gene expression profiling also showed an
effect on genes involved in apoptosis: four genes involved
in apoptosis were found to be up-regulated only during
the first cycle of combined treatment. C-JUN transcription
factor is implicated in several functions including
apoptosis induction in various experimental systems such
as multiple myeloma [39]; the positive mediator of FAS
inducing apoptosis GADD45B, is crucial for activation of
pro-apoptotic genes [40]; NFKBIA and TNFAIP3 are both
negative regulators of NFKB, anti apoptotic transcription
factor inducing pro-survival pathways [41, 42].
In conclusion, MCL cell lines are considerably more
sensitive to Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors as single agents
than other lymphoma cell lines and epithelial tumor cell
lines. Our experimental data suggested a correlation of the
t(11;14) chromosomal translocation with Chk1 inhibitor
sensitivity. The drugs combination presented a strong
synergism at very low concentrations both in an in vitro and
in an in vivo setting. The crucial non redundant role played
by both proteins in control of DNA replication initiation
and progression may explain why the drugs combination
was highly effective in MCL cells, which are characterized
by cell cycle deregulation. As a whole, our data provide
strong preclinical evidence for the translation of Chk1 and
Wee1 inhibitor combination in the clinical setting, hopefully
providing a new therapeutic approach to treat MCL patients.

seven replicates each concentration, using an automated
liquid handling system (JANUS™, PerkinElmer),
connected to a WinPREP for Janus software, with which
it is possible to set up ad hoc programs for the seeding and
treatments. MTS assay, performed 72 hrs after treatment,
was used to measure cell proliferation using a plate
reader (Infinite M200, TECAN). For validation step the
experimental setting of 96 well plates was used. The IC50s
of the two compounds for each cell line were calculated
by Calcusyn Software. A non parametric Mann Whitney
t-test statistical analysis was performed to compare
median values. To obtain the response of cell lines to the
combination of PF-00477736 with MK-1775, cells were
treated simultaneously with growing concentrations of
the two drugs. Results were examined by isobologram
analysis with Calcusyn Software (Biosoft), to calculate
the efficacy (combination index, CI) of the experimental
points (details in Supplementary Methods).

METHODS

Caspase-3 activity assay

Cell cultures

Caspase-3 activity was measured by enzymatic
assay using a fluorogenic substrate for caspase-3,
Ac-DEVD-AMC (acetyl Asp-Glu-Val-Asp 7-amido4-methylcoumarin) as already described [13].

Western blotting analysis
Proteins were extracted and visualized using
standard techniques, and as already described [43].
(Antibodies details in Supplementary Methods)

Immunofluorescence analysis
To stain with phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX), JeKo-1
and REC-1 cells were treated as already described [43].

A total of 40 human established cell lines were used:
ten cell lines derived from MCL (GRANTA-519, JeKo-1,
JVM-2, MAVER-1, MINO, REC-1, SP-49, SP-53, UPN-1
and Z-138), seven (RIVA, HBL-1, TMD8, U2932,
SU-DHL-2, OCILY3, OCILY10) from activated B-cell
like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL),
18 (Pfeiffer, OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly2, OCI-Ly7, OCI-Ly8,
OCI-Ly18, OCI-Ly19, KARPAS422, SU-DHL-4,
SU-DHL-6, SU-DHL-7, SU-DHL10, FARAGE, VAL,
WSU-DLCL, TOLEDO, RCK8, DOHH2) from germinal
center B (GCB) cell DLBCL, and five (KMS12BM, U266
KMS11, RPMI8226 and OPM2) from multiple myeloma
(MM). They were maintained in RPMI supplemented with
1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Details on cell lines and drugs are
specified in Supplementary Methods.

FACS-Analysis
To detect DNA by FACS, cells were fixed 24 and
48 hrs after PF-00477736 and MK-1775 treatments either
singly or combined and processed as already described
[43]. Percentages of cell cycle phases (G1-S-G2/M) of
Jeko-1, Maver-1 and Z-138 cell lines after treatment
for 24 and 48 hrs with PF-00477736, MK-1775 and the
combination were obtained analyzing DNA histograms
with the previously described software [44]

Two-parameter flow cytometry analysis: DNA
content and FITC-conjugated dUTP
DNA fragmentation in JeKo-1 cells, either
untreated or treated with PF-00477736, MK-1775 or the
combination was detected by the TdT-mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling technique (TUNEL), following a
procedure already described [13].

Quantification of the effect of the treatments
Cell lines were seeded in the experimental setting of
384 well plate and treated with ten growing concentrations
of each drug (ranging between 0.05 nM and 100 µM) and

Analysis of gene expression and real time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNeasy
total RNA Isolation kit (Quiagen), and with the
SV-total RNA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega, Milan, Italy), for xenografts tumor fragments
(homogenised in RNA lysis buffer in ice with an UltraTurrax), quantified by NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Gene
expression profiling was done using the HumanHT-12 v4
Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and
data were first extracted with the Illumina GenomeStudio
software and then imported in R and quantile normalized,
as previously performed [45]. Functional annotation was
performed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
tool using the GSEA C2 and C3.tft collections [46] and
the SignatureDB gene-sets collection [47]. Differential
expression analysis was performed using LIMMA [48].
Statistical significance was multiple test corrected using
the Benjamini & Hochberg method. Transcripts with
FDR < 0.10 were considered statically deregulated.
Raw data will be available at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus

Xenografts models
Five-week-old female NCr-nu/nu mice were obtained
from Harlan S.p.a Italy and maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions. Procedures involving animals and
their care were conducted in conformity with institutional
guidelines, in compliance with national and international
laws and policies and in line with Guidelines for the welfare
and use of animals in cancer research [49]. Exponentially
growing JeKo-1 cells were injected subcutaneously in three
mice (approximately 107 cells per mouse). When tumors
grew, animals were sacrificed and tumor fragments were
implanted subcutaneously in sixty mice. When tumors
reached approximately 150 mg, animals were randomized
(seven or eight per group) to receive PF-00477736 i.p.,
10 mg/kg, MK-1775 orally twice a day, 30 mg/kg or the
combination of both at these dosages or at half doses, for
16 days (COMBO I). A second cycle of treatment was
given to the high dose combination group for 11 days, after
5 days treatment withdraw, when tumors started to re-grow
(COMBO II). Animals were sacrificed when tumor weight
reached the 10% of their body weight. Pharmacodynamic
studies are described in Supplementary Methods.
