Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aromatase cytochrome P450 is the only enzyme in vertebrates known to catalyse the biosynthesis
of all oestrogens from androgens1–3. Aromatase inhibitors therefore constitute a front-line therapy
for oestrogen-dependent breast cancer3,4. In a three-step process, each step requiring 1 mol of O2,
1 mol of NADPH, and coupling with its redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase, aromatase
converts androstenedione, testosterone and 16α-hydroxytestosterone to oestrone, 17β-oestradiol
and 17β,16α-oestriol, respectively1–3. The first two steps are C19-methyl hydroxylation steps, and
the third involves the aromatization of the steroid A-ring, unique to aromatase. Whereas most
P450s are not highly substrate selective, it is the hallmark androgenic specificity that sets
aromatase apart. The structure of this enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane has
remained unknown for decades, hindering elucidation of the biochemical mechanism. Here we
present the crystal structure of human placental aromatase, the only natural mammalian, fulllength P450 and P450 in hormone biosynthetic pathways to be crystallized so far. Unlike the
active sites of many microsomal P450s that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, aromatase has an
androgen-specific cleft that binds the androstenedione molecule snugly. Hydrophobic and polar
residues exquisitely complement the steroid backbone. The locations of catalytically important
residues shed light on the reaction mechanism. The relative juxtaposition of the hydrophobic
amino-terminal region and the opening to the catalytic cleft shows why membrane anchoring is
necessary for the lipophilic substrates to gain access to the active site. The molecular basis for the
enzyme’s androgenic specificity and unique catalytic mechanism can be used for developing nextgeneration aromatase inhibitors.
Human aromatase is the product of the CYP19A1 gene on chromosome 15q21.1 and consists
of a haem group and a polypeptide chain of 503 amino-acid residues. Although aromatase
has been extensively studied for more than 35 years1–3,5–19, the mechanism of the
aromatization step remains poorly understood. Many soluble bacterial P450s, such as
P450cam20 and P450eryF21, as well as recombinant human microsomal P450s, such as
3A4 (ref. 22), 2D6 (ref. 23) and 2A6 (ref. 24), that metabolize drug/xenobiotics, have been

crystallized and studied by X-ray crystallography. Several laboratories have reported the
purification of aromatase from human placenta7,8 and recombinant expression
systems14,18. Nevertheless, attempts to crystallize either the placental or a recombinant or
modified aromatase have been unsuccessful and an experimental aromatase structure has
remained unknown. Numerous mechanistic and homology models based on known P450
structures and site-directed mutagenesis data have been proposed5,6,9–13,15–18, leading to
the identification of catalytically important residues and possible substrate-binding modes.

The 2.90-Å resolution crystal structure of aromatase purified from term human placenta19 in
complex with its natural substrate androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione) exhibits the
characteristic cytochrome P450 fold (Fig. 1a; see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table 1). Androstenedione binds with its β-face oriented towards the haem
group and C19 4.0 Å from the Fe atom (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). To test the
catalytic viability of the substrate-binding mode, the haem Fe is modelled as a hypothetical
oxyferryl Fe(IV)=O moiety (Fig. 1c). The resulting binding geometry of the C19 methyl
hydrogens closely resembles that of the reactants for hydroxylation by P450cam25. The
residues comprising the catalytic cleft are Ile 305, Ala 306, Asp 309 and Thr 310 from the Ihelix, Phe 221 and Trp 224 from the F-helix, Ile 133 and Phe 134 from the B–C loop, Val
370, Leu 372 and Val 373 from the K-helix–β3 loop, Met 374 from β3, and Leu 477 and Ser
478 from the β8–β9 loop (Fig. 1b). The 17-keto oxygen of the substrate makes a hydrogen
bond (2.8 Å) with the backbone amide of Met 374 and a weak contact (3.4 Å) with NH1 of
Arg 115 (Fig. 1b). The 3-keto oxygen is 2.6 Å from the carboxylate Oδ2 of the Asp 309 side
chain (Figs 1b and 2a, b), indicating that the carboxylate moiety may be protonated. The
hydrophobic residues and porphyrin rings of haem pack tightly against the steroid backbone,
forming a cavity complementary in shape to the bound steroid (Fig. 2a). The side chains of
residues Arg 115, Ile 133, Phe 134, Phe 221, Trp 224, Ala 306, Thr 310, Val 370, Val 373,
Met 374 and Leu 477 make direct van der Waals contacts with the bound androstenedione.
Ile 133, Phe 134, Phe 221, Trp 224 and Leu 477 approach the substrate from the α-face and
follow the contour and puckering of the steroid backbone, while the side chains of Arg 115,
Ala 306 and Met 374 make contacts at its edge, and Thr 310, Val 370 and Val 373 on the βface. The combined surface creates a pocket that encloses the bound androstenedione
snugly. The volume of the binding pocket is no more than 400 Å3, considerably smaller than
the volume of about 530 Å3 of the active sites in 3A4 (ref. 22) and 2D6 (ref. 23), the two
drug/xenobiotic-metabolizing human P450s with highest sequence identities (14–18%) to
human aromatase.

A distortion in the I-helix backbone resulting in a roughly 3.5-Å displacement of the helix
axis is crucial for creating the androgen-specific binding pocket at the active site. This shift
in the helix axis caused by Pro 308, a residue unique to aromatase among all P450s, is
stabilized by a strong Ala 306CO···HOThr 310 (2.8 Å) hydrogen bond, as well as by an Asp
309 peptide CO···water (3.4 Å) interaction (Fig. 2b). Although an irregularity in the I-helix
backbone at this region is observed in other P450s20–24,26, this Pro 308-mediated axis shift
precisely accommodates the 3-keto end of androstenedione near the fifth turn of the helix
(Met 303 to Ala 307), allowing the Asp 309 side chain to hydrogen-bond to the 3-keto
oxygen (Fig. 2b). Superposition of the aromatase backbone with bacterial P450cam and
P450eryF (Supplementary Fig. 3) as well as with human P450 3A4 and P450 2D6
(Supplementary Fig. 4) shows that without this shift, the 3-keto end of the substrate would
clash with the I-helices of P450cam, P450eryF, P450 2D6 and P450 3A4. The structure
therefore confirms the critical roles of Pro 308 and Asp 309 predicted by mutagenesis and
modelling9,10,15.
The Asp 309 side chain also forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule 3.0 Å from Oδ1
(Figs 1b and 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). The geometries of these two hydrogen bonds

place the 3-keto oxygen and the water oxygen atom roughly in the carboxylate plane (Fig.
2b). Furthermore, this water molecule is situated at 3.6 Å from the guanidinium group of the
Arg 192 side chain (Fig. 2b), which forms a salt bridge with Glu 483. An elongated electron
density adjacent to the Ser 478 side chain (Supplementary Fig. 5) was modelled as two
water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to each other and to the Ser 478 side chain OH, which in
turn donates a hydrogen bond to His 480 Nδ1 farther from the active site. The Ser 478 side
chain is linked through these two water molecules to Arg 192 by a weak hydrogen bond (3.4
Å; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5). It is probably as a result of being linked to this
network of proton donors on one side, and the keto group of a large hydrophobic substrate
on the other, that the Asp 309 side chain remains protonated and engaged in the substratebinding interaction. This network could also serve as the proton source for the proposed
participation of the Asp 309 carboxylate moiety in the enolization process, as discussed
below.

H2β of the A-ring of the bound androstenedione (Fig. 3a) that gets abstracted in the
aromatization step is close to the Ala 306CO···HOγThr 310 pair (C=O···H2β-C2:3.7 Å and
C2-H2β···OγH: 3.8 Å). Thr 310, highly conserved in P450s, has been implicated in the P450
hydroxylation steps. The mechanism of P450 hydroxylation has been studied extensively for
two bacterial enzymes, P450cam20 and P450eryF21. In the dioxygen complex of P450cam,
the residue pair Thr 252–Gly 248 carbonyl, and two catalytic water molecules, are involved
in the activation of ferrous dioxygen to the hydroxylating Fe(IV)=O species by providing
two protons20. A similar hydroxylation mechanism involving the corresponding Thr 310–
Ala 306 carbonyl pair, and catalytic water molecules (the binding of which could be
promoted by dioxygen binding as in P450cam), is probably at work for each of the first two
steps catalysed by aromatase, yielding the C19-aldehyde derivative of androstene-dione
through 19,19-gem-diol formation and retention of the pro-S hydrogen1–3,5,6. The same
catalytic residues could also be responsible for the H2β abstraction of the 2,3-enolization
processes in the aromatization step. To accomplish this, a nucleophilic attack on H2β-C by
the Ala 306CO···HOγThr 310 moiety (perhaps along with a water) and a concerted
electrophilic attack on the C3-keto oxygen by a protonated Asp 309 side chain could
promote the H2β abstraction and 2,3-enolization, akin to –H2C2–C3-keto to -HC2=C3-enol
tautomerization (Fig. 3b). A bound water molecule (perhaps linked to the proton relay
network) between Thr 310-Oγ and the iron-peroxy/hydroperoxy intermediate could lower
the pKa of Thr 310-OγH, rendering Ala 306C=O a more potent nucleophile; alternatively, it
could itself act as a nucleophile, as shown in Fig. 3b. Asp 309 thus seems to have a direct
participation in enolization, unlike the indirect roles of Asp 251 and Glu 244 in
hydroxylation by P450cam and P450eryF, respectively20,21. A density-function-theory
calculation for the final catalytic step of aromatase suggests a strikingly low energy barrier
(less than 7 kcal mol−1) for H1β abstraction when steroids are 2,3-enolized27. However, the
1β hydrogen is too far from this carbonyl (6.2 Å) to be abstracted in such a manner. It points
at and is close to the haem Fe (4.2 Å), and is probably removed after the Fe-peroxy
nucleophilic attack on the 19-aldehyde (Fig. 3b) as previously proposed3,5,6.
To examine how a mechanism-based steroidal inhibitor could interfere with the
aromatization process, an exemestane (Aromasin; one of the three aromatase inhibitors
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) molecule was built into the active site
(Fig. 3c) by using the androstenedione backbone. The two steroids superimpose quite well
(root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation about 0.2 Å), except for differences in puckering of the
A-rings. The extra C6-methylidene group in exemestane is accommodated in a shallow
hydrophobic crevice surrounded by the side-chain C atoms Thr 310-Cγ, Val 370-Cγ2 and
Ser 478-Cβ, at the mouth of the active-site access channel (described below). The distance
between the methylidene C and Cγ-Thr 310 is 3 Å, shorter than the van der Waals contact
distance. Indeed, a slight adjustment of these side chains on the binding of exemestane is

highly likely. The clamping of C6-methylidene in a hydrophobic surrounding, resulting in
entropic gain and a lowering of the free energy and the dissociation constant, could greatly
reduce the mobility of the Thr 310 side chain and/or interfere with its ability to interact with
the catalytic waters for the creation of the active oxyferryl moiety. Exemestane would thus
remain tightly bound in the pocket without being hydroxylated at C19.
An access channel links the active site to the outer surface. Figure 4a is a view of the interior
of a semi-transparent solvent-excluded surface28 that also excludes the active-site region,
consisting of the steroid-binding pocket and haem, from the protein interior by forming a
‘pouch’-like cleft that opens only to the exterior through the channel, at the arrowhead. The
inset shows a view along this channel, revealing the locations of three water molecules
within the channel and a glimpse of the opening to the active-site cavity. The salt-bridging
Arg 192–Glu 483 pair as well as Asp 309 and Ser 478 line the channel that hosts the
putative proton relay network and is also probably the major transport route to and from the
active site for water, oxygen and steroid molecules. This channel seems to be a confluence
of what was previously described as channels 2a, 2ac and 2c for other P450s29. Although it
becomes narrower at points, the channel is probably flexible to permit the passage of
molecules such as steroids.

Having seven cysteines in the reduced form, the bulk of aromatase probably resides in the
reducing environment of the cytoplasm. A hydrophobicity plot of the aromatase sequence
suggests lipid integration for residues 21–42 and 49–71, thereby placing the N terminus with
glycosylation at Asn 12 on the opposite side; that is, the lumen30. It is possible that the
transmembrane segment of residues 21–42, which is too short to traverse the bilayer as a
regular α-helix, is at least partly an extended polypeptide devoid of secondary structure. This
is consistent with the observed weak electron density for the polypeptide chain beyond
residue 45 towards the N terminus. It is also likely that the hydrophobic helix A′ (residues
57–68) and part of helix A (residues 69–80) are embedded in the membrane. This
arrangement positions several arginine (Arg 64, Arg 79 and Arg 86) and tryptophan (Trp 67
and Trp 88; Trp 239 from the F–G loop) residues at the lipid/protein interface, a telltale sign
of lipid integration. Besides, electron densities for at least two detergent molecules were
identified near Trp 67 of helix A′. We therefore propose that lipid integration of aromatase
begins with these helices as the N terminus traverses farther into the bilayer towards the
lumen side. A model (Fig. 4b) based on these concepts places the entrance to the active-site
access channel (Fig. 4a) on the membrane surface. Although other possible entry and exit
routes cannot be excluded, this arrangement allows the lipophilic substrate to enter the
aromatase active site directly from within the membrane, travelling between and across the
F–G loop and the β8–β9 loop, roughly along the path indicated by the white arrow in Fig.
4b. The structure of aromatase therefore provides a rationale for its crucial membrane
integration.
The crystal structure of human aromatase reveals a finely tuned molecular machine that
makes oestrogens from androgens. Use of the molecular basis for enzyme–substrate and
enzyme–drug interactions could lead to more efficacious intervention of oestrogen
production.

METHODS SUMMARY
Aromatase was purified from term human placenta by immuno-affinity chromatography in a
highly active form. It was complexed with androstenedione and crystallized at 4 °C in the
oxidized high-spin ferric state of the haem iron with poly(ethylene glycol) 4000 as the
precipitant. The space group was P3221 and the unit cell parameters are a =b =140.2 Å, c
=119.3 Å, α = β =90°, γ =120°, having one aromatase molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Diffraction data at about 100 K were collected initially at the Cornell High Energy
Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and then to 2.90 Å resolution at the Advanced Photon Source,
Argonne National Laboratory, with glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Two data sets at the Fe
absorption edge were also collected at the CHESS. The structure was solved by the
molecular replacement method coupled with Bijvoet difference Fourier synthesis for
identifying the correct solution. Model building and refinement were performed with Coot
and Refmac5, respectively. The final model contained 452 amino acid residues; 44 Nterminal and 7 C-terminal residues could not be built because of weakness of their electron
densities. The final R factor for all reflections between 38 and 2.90 Å resolution was 0.214,
and the R-free value was 0.244. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths and angles from ideal
values were 0.009 Å and 1.32°, respectively. The average isotropic thermal factor for all
atoms was 77.3 Å2. There were only two violations in the backbone torsion angle
Ramachandran plot, both in the loop regions. The oxyferryl Fe(IV)=O moiety was generated
by adding an oxygen atom to Fe with the modelling software MOE (Chemical Computing
Group) The exemestane molecule was built into the active site by superimposing it on the
experimentally derived androstenedione atomic positions with MOE.

METHODS
Purification and crystallization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the microsomal fraction of homogenized
fresh human placenta by immunoaffinity chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The
purified enzyme was highly active: the specific activity with androstenedione as the
substrate ranged between about 10 and about 100 nmol min−1 mg−1 over a large number of
purification experiments. Details of this procedure have been described previously19,31. The
absorption spectrum of the androstenedione complex had a Soret band at 394 nm
(Supplementary Fig. 1b), which is characteristic of the oxidized high-spin ferric (Fe3+) state
of the haem iron and is suggestive of the formation of the androstenedione complex32.
Freshly purified aromatase in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 20%
glycerol, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM androstenedione and 1 mM n-dodecyl-β-Dmaltopyranoside (BDM) was mixed with reservoir cocktails of 24–30% poly(ethylene
glycol) 4000 and 0.5 M NaCl in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5 and vapour-diffused in
sealed 24-well sitting-drop plates against corresponding reservoir solution. The purification
and crystallization experiments were all conducted at 4 °C. Reddish-brown hexagonal rodshaped crystals appeared in 7–10 days and continued to grow up to 14–16 days. Typically,
the crystals were about 0.05–0.50 mm in length, with a hexagonal cross-section of about
0.01–0.12 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

Data collection
Initially, diffraction data sets to about 3.3 Å resolution were collected at the A-1 station of
the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The crystal was flash-cooled in a
stream of liquid nitrogen with about 40% glycerol as the cryoprotectant, and maintained at
about 100 K during data collection. Additionally, two data sets, each to 4.2 Å resolution,
were measured at the CHESS F-2 station by tuning the beam to the peak and the inflection
point of the iron absorption edge (inflection (1.7433 Å): total 31,833, unique 9,814,
completion 97%, I/σI highest 4.1, Rmerge 0.159; remote (1.7284 Å): total 32,671, unique
9,903, completion 98%, I/σI highest 4.6, Rmerge 0.126). Finally, a 2.9-Å diffraction data set
used for solution and refinement of the structure was gathered at cryogenic temperature at
beamline 19-ID-D (0.979 Å) of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.
The data were recorded on an ADSC Q315 CCD detector and processed with the HKL3000
software package33. The space group was P3221 and the unit cell parameters were a = b =
140.2 Å, c = 119.3 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. There was one aromatase molecule in the

asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of about 79%. A total of 184,295 diffraction
intensities were measured, yielding 30,371 unique reflections. The diffraction data were
99.4% complete to 2.90 Å resolution with an overall intensity to sigma ratio of 31.1 and an
Rmerge of 0.067. The intensity to sigma ratio was 2.8 in the highest-resolution shell.

Structure solution and refinement

The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method (at 3.3 Å), coupled with
Bijvoet difference Fourier synthesis with the Fe-absorption edge data sets (at 4.5 Å). The
latter helped in identifying the correct molecular replacement solution, at the same time
confirming that there was one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Extensive rotation and
translation function searches were conducted with a large number of P450 coordinates from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID codes: 1PQ2, 1R90, 1TQN, 1Z10, 1W0E, 1Z11, 1ZO4,
1ZOA, 2F9Q, 2FDV, 2FDY, 2FDU, 2FDW, 2HI4, 2J0C, 2J0D, 2OJD and 2P85) with the
AMORE and MOLREP routines in the CCP4 software package34. Only two search models
yielded the correct molecular replacement solution: 2F9Q (human P450 2D6; ref. 23) and
1W0E (human P450 3A4; ref. 22), the two human cytochrome P450s with highest sequence
identities with aromatase (14–18%). Model building and refinement were performed with
Coot35 and Refmac5 (ref. 36) routines, respectively, running on either a dual-CPU G5 or a
Powerbook G4 with the Mac OS 10.4 operating system. The final model contained 452
amino-acid residues, a haem group, one androstenedione molecule, 35 solvent waters and 2
phosphate ions (3,767 total atoms). Models for 44 N-terminal and 7 C-terminal residues
could not be built because of weakness of the their electron densities. Apart from these
residues, the electron density for the rest of the molecule was mostly well defined, except for
two short loop/turn regions. The fit between the experimental electron density of side chains
and the corresponding sequence was excellent except for a few exposed charged amino
acids, such as lysines. In the space of missing N-terminal residues, an isolated patch of weak
electron density was identifiable and could be fitted to a four-turn helix. However, because
of the lack of side-chain identities, the helix could not be modelled unequivocally.
Additionally, electron densities for two detergent molecules were located near the Trp 67
side chain, the presumed transmembrane region of the enzyme, but were not included in the
final refinement because of the possibility of multiple orientations of the sugar moiety or the
alkyl chain. The final R factor for all reflections between 37.8 and 2.90 Å resolutions was
0.214, and the R-free value was 0.244. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths and angles
from ideal values were 0.009 Å and 1.32°, respectively. The average isotropic thermal factor
(B) for all atoms was 77.3 Å2, whereas the Wilson plot B-value was 94.5 Å2. Of 407 nonglycine and non-proline residues, there were two violations in the backbone torsion angle
Ramachandran plot, all in weaker loop regions. Overall random coordinate errors were 0.33
Å (based on R-working), 0.26 Å (on R-free) and 0.19 Å (on maximum likelihood). A
summary of all numbers from refinement is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
The overall structure of aromatase
The structure of aromatase consists of 12 major α-helices (A to L) and 10 β-strands (1 to 10)
distributed into one major and three minor sheets, and follows the characteristic cytochrome
P450 fold (Fig. 1a). The major β-sheet is a mixed four-stranded sheet that begins near the N
terminus (β1:83–88 and β2:93–97) but ends in two strands from the C-terminal half of the
polypeptide chain (β3:373–376 and β6:393–396). The N-terminal residues 47–50 make one
backbone hydrogen bond with β1 and add an extra β-strand-like element to this sheet in
aromatase. Each of the three minor sheets consists of two antiparallel strands scattered over
the polypeptide chain (sheet2: β4:381–383 and β5:386–388; sheet3: β8:473–475 and
β9:479–481; sheet4: β7:458–461 and β10:491–494). Of the 12 major helices, I (293–324), F
(210–227), G (242–267), H (278–287), C (138–152), D (155–174), E (187–205), J (326–

341), K (354–366) and L (440–455) are similar to those found in most of the cytochrome
P450s. Helices A′ (57–68), A (69–80), B′ (100–109), B (119–126), G′ (232–236), H′ (271–
274), J′ (346–349), K′ (398–404) and K″ (414–418) are one to four turns long and have
more variability among P450s. The residues in aromatase involved in haem coordination are
Arg 115, Trp 141, Arg 145, Arg 375 and Arg 435.

Figure 1. The structure of aromatase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, A ribbon diagram showing the overall structure. The N terminus, starting at residue 45, is
coloured dark blue and the C terminus ending at residue 496 is coloured red. The α-helices
are labelled from A to L and β-strands are numbered from 1 to 10. The haem group, the
bound androstenedione molecule at the active site and its polar interactions are shown. b, A
close-up view of the active site showing the bound androstenedione molecule in unbiased
difference (Fobs − Fcal) electron density contoured at 4.5 times the standard deviation. c,
Modelling of Fe(III) as an oxyferryl Fe(IV)=O moiety. The C19-methyl hydrogen atoms are
shown at the calculated ideal positions. Important side chains, haem and water molecules are
depicted in element colours: grey, C; blue, N; red, O; yellow, S; firebrick, Fe; orange, H.
The C atoms of androstenedione are coloured cornflower blue. This colour code is used in
all figures. Distances are in ångströms. The directions of view into the active site are roughly
similar in all panels. Unless otherwise noted, all three-dimensional illustrations were
prepared with Chimera28.

Figure 2. Views of the active site of aromatase

a, A van der Waals interaction surface cast by the protein and haem atoms at the active site.
The semi-transparent surface, coloured green for hydrophobic interactions and magenta for
polar interactions, closely resembles the shape, size and puckering of the steroid backbone.
This figure was prepared with MOE. b, A view along the I-helix axis from its N-terminal
end. The disruption to the helicity of the backbone at residues Pro 308-Asp 309-Thr 310
causes the helix axis to displace by about 3.5 Å, allowing the side chain of Asp 309 to
interact with the 3-keto oxygen of the steroid. The deviation from helicity could be
stabilized by a strong Ala 306CO···HOThr 310 (2.8 Å) hydrogen bond, as well as by Asp
309 peptide CO···water (3.4 Å) interaction as indicated.

Figure 3. Steroid–protein interactions and mechanistic implications

a, A close-up view of the Ala 306CO···HOThr 310 pair that may function in the
aromatization of the A-ring of androstenedione. Calculated hydrogen-atom positions of C2
of the bound androstenedione are shown. Distances are in ångströms. b, A possible
mechanism for H2β abstraction and 2,3-enolization that could be initiated by a nucleophilic
attack on C2-H2β by the Ala 306CO···HOThr 310 pair, along with an electrophilic attack on
the C3 carbonyl by a protonated Asp 309 side chain. The direction of proton flow from the
proton relay network through Asp 309 carboxylate to the substrate is indicated by arrows.
Involvement of a catalytic water in H2β abstraction is a possibility. The backbone carbonyl
of the Ala 306CO···HOThr 310 pair aided by a potential catalytic water molecule, or the

water oxygen itself (as indicated by dotted arrow) could act as the nucleophile. H1β
abstraction is drawn as proposed previously6. c, Modelling of an exemestane molecule (C
atoms in magenta) after the experimental positioning of androstenedione. The short van der
Waals contact distance (3 Å) between the C6-methylidene carbon and Cγ of Thr 310 is
indicated by a black line.

Figure 4. A putative active-site access channel from within the lipid bilayer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, The solvent-excluded surface28 of aromatase excludes the steroid-binding pocket and
haem from the protein interior by forming a ‘pouch’-like cleft that has the only opening to
the protein exterior through a channel, roughly at the arrowhead. The course of the
polypeptide chain is shown in rainbow colour. Residues Arg 192, Asp 309, Ser 478 and Glu
483 border this channel from the protein interior; three water molecules, part of the proton
relay network, are within the channel. The inset is a view along this channel at the
arrowhead, showing the locations of water molecules and opening to the active site. b, In a
proposed membrane integration model, the opening to the active-site access channel rests on
the lipid bilayer surface, allowing the steroids to enter the aromatase active site directly from
within the bilayer, roughly along the arrow shown. The model suggests lipid integration/
association of the N terminus up to helix A, and other loops near the C terminus. The
orientation of aromatase is roughly the same in both panels.
