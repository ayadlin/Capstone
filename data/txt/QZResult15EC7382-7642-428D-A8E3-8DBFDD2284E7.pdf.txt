BACKGROUND: A chemosensitizing effect of levetiracetam (LEV) has been suggested because LEV inhibits O-6 methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT). However, the survival benefit of LEV has not been clinically documented. The objective of this study was
to assess the survival benefit of LEV compared with other antiepileptic drugs as a chemosensitizer to temozolomide for patients
with glioblastoma. METHODS: In total, 103 consecutive patients with primary glioblastoma who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide were retrospectively reviewed, and 58 patients (56%) received LEV during
temozolomide chemotherapy for at least 3 months. A Cox regression survival analysis was performed to adjust for confounding factors, including age, extent of lesion, Karnofsky performance scale score, extent of removal, and MGMT promoter methylation status.
RESULTS: The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients who received LEV in combination with
temozolomide (PFS: median, 9.4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5-11.3 months; OS: median, 25.7 months; 95% CI, 21.7-29.7
months) were significantly longer than those for patients who did not receive LEV (PFS: median, 6.7 months; 95% CI, 5.8-7.6 months;
OS: median, 16.7 months; 95% CI, 12.1-21.3 months; P 5.010 and P 5.027, respectively). In multivariate analysis, the variables that were
identified as significant prognostic factors for OS were preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score (hazard ratio [HR], 0.37;
P 5.016), MGMT promoter methylation (HR, 0.30; P 5.002), and receipt of LEV (HR, 0.31; P <.001. CONCLUSIONS: LEV may provide a

INTRODUCTION
Since 2005, the standard postoperative treatment for patients with primary glioblastoma has been concomitant chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide.1 Despite recent advances in the treatment of glioblastoma,
most patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma survive for no more than 2 years after diagnosis.1 Recently, there has
been a great interest in identifying novel therapeutic drugs, modifications to the temozolomide treatment protocol, or a
combination of agents that will increase the anticancer potency of temozolomide.2
The intrinsic anticancer potency of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and their synergistic effects with chemotherapy or
radiotherapy have been suggested.3,4 The anticancer effects of AEDs can be significant, because the lifetime seizure risk
for patients with glioblastomas ranges from 30% to 50% and also because many patients with glioblastoma have received
an AED during the perioperative and postoperative periods.5 Conversely, physicians hesitate to prescribe AEDs for
patients with glioblastoma during the postoperative and follow-up periods not only because of drug interactions or side
effects6 but also because most guidelines propose stopping AEDs after surgery in the absence of a history of seizure. The
older enzyme-inducing AEDs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, induce hepatic cytochrome P450
coenzymes and may decrease the effectiveness of several chemotherapeutic agents as well as corticosteroids.6 Therefore,
recent guidelines have recommended the use of nonenzyme-inducing AEDs, such as valproic acid (VPA), lamotrigine,
topiramate, and levetiracetam (LEV), as first-line drugs for patients with brain tumors.5 Among those drugs, VPA

LEV, a newly developed AED, has been in the limelight lately because of its favorable seizure-preventive efficacy and few side effects.5,13 A recently published report
indicated that LEV inhibited transcription of the O-6
methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene
through the p53-mediated compressor complex and sensitized glioblastoma cells to temozolomide.4 However, no
clinical evaluations have proven the anticancer effects or
survival benefit of LEV. The objective of the current analysis was to assess the survival benefit of LEV compared
with other AEDs as a chemosensitizer to temozolomide
for patients with glioblastoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Cohort

In total, 161 consecutive patients were diagnosed with primary glioblastoma between 2005 and 2013 at our institution. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows:
1) adult patients aged >17 years; 2) histopathologically
confirmed, newly diagnosed glioblastoma; 3) patients
underwent surgery and postoperatively received concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide; and 4) patients had clinical
follow-up >3 months and at least 1 radiologic follow-up.
Twenty-seven patients who received only radiation and
10 patients who received only chemotherapy as postoperative primary treatment were excluded from this study. We
also excluded 21 patients who did not have a minimum
follow-up of 3 months. Thus, in total, 103 patients (64%)
were retrospectively reviewed in this study.
The median patient age was 59 years (range, 18-84
years). Eighteen of 103 patients (18%) had experienced
seizures preoperatively. An extended lesion, which we
defined as multiple lesions, a lesion occupying 2 lobes,
or a lesion with leptomeningeal seeding, was identified in
35 patients (34%). Thirty-eight patients (37%) achieved
95% tumor removal based on preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations.
Baseline clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients are
summarized in Table 1.

administered daily 1 hour before radiation therapy or in
the morning on days without radiation therapy.
After CCRT, patients had a 4-week break and then
received up to 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide according to a standard 5-day schedule, every 4 weeks. The
temozolomide dose was 150 mg/m2 daily for the first
cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 daily at the beginning
of the second cycle. If a follow-up MRI revealed disease
progression, then the standard protocol of adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide was stopped, and salvage
treatments, including reoperation, radiosurgery, or chemotherapy with other agents, were delivered according to
the treating physician’s discretion.
The patients who had a history of preoperative seizure received an AED for a therapeutic purpose, and the
other patients with supratentorial tumors received an
AED for prophylaxis during the perioperative and postoperative phases. During the postoperative chemotherapy
phase, if seizures recurred, then either the AED dose was
increased or other AEDs were added. The AEDs were either stopped or tapered off at the treating physician’s discretion if there were no seizures after the adjuvant
chemotherapy period.
Study Design

For the analysis of survival effects of LEV, we evaluated
patients who had received concomitant and adjuvant
temozolomide and had received LEV in combination
with temozolomide for at least 3 months. The duration
of 3 months was confined only to the postoperatively
temozolomide therapy period in this study. Of all 103
patients in this study, 58 (56%) received LEV during
2928

temozolomide chemotherapy. The 9 patients who
received combination therapy with LEV and other
AEDs, including 5 who received VPA and 14 who
received topiramate over 3 months, were categorized into
the LEV group.
Of the remaining patients, 17 received VPA, 12
received topiramate, 2 received pregabalin, 1 received oxcarbazepine, 5 received polytherapy without LEV, and 8
received no AED. We assessed the differences in baseline
clinical characteristics between patients who did and did not
receive LEV to adjust for confounding factors that may have
influenced their prognosis. The distribution of patients
according to age, history of preoperative seizure, extent of
lesion, preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) scores, extent of removal, and MGMT promoter methylation status did not differ significantly between
those who did and did not receive LEV. Differences in clinical parameters between patients who did and did not receive
LEV are summarized in Table 2. However, the extent of
lesion was excluded from risk factor analyses because it did
not satisfy the proportional hazard assumption.15
First, we evaluated progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes for the 58
patients who received LEV were compared with the outcomes of the remaining 45 patients who either received
AEDs other than LEV or did not receive an AED. The
current tumor response observed on MRI was evaluated
using updated Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
criteria.16 The results of postoperative CCRT with adjuvant treatment as well as the side effects of each AED also
were assessed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the authors’ center.
Statistical Analyses

PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Differences with regard to survival and disease
progression were tested for significance using 2-sided logrank tests.17 The risk factors for survival and disease progression were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards
model with a backward stepwise method.18 To reduce the
chance of type II errors because of the modest sample size,
variables were considered for the multivariate analysis
only if they were associated with a dependent variable in
each analysis that was significant at the P < .25 level. All
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 17.0.1, 2008; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill). The sufficient sample size and proportional
hazard assumption for each factor was measured using the
power analysis software (PASS) package (version 11.0,
2012; NCSS LLC, East Kaysville, Utah).19

RESULTS
Delivery of Treatment

All 103 patients who were included in this study completed CCRT with temozolomide according to the protocol published by Stupp et al in 2005 regardless of
which AED they received.1 The parameters of the postoperative treatments received by patients are summarized
in Table 2. The time delay between surgery and CCRT,
the duration of CCRT, and the radiation dose in the
group that received LEV (n 5 58) did not differ significantly compared with those in the group that did not
receive LEV (n 5 45; P > .05). Although 37 patients
(64%) who received LEV completed 6 cycles of adjuvant
temozolomide chemotherapy, only 17 patients (38%)
who did not receive LEV completed 6 cycles (P 5 .010).
After disease progression was detected on follow-up
MRI, 55 of 86 patients (64%) received various salvage
treatments. The salvage treatments after progression are
described in Table 2. The distribution of the salvage
treatments between patients who did and did not receive
LEV was not significantly different (P 5 .823). Thirteen
patients (23%) in the group that received LEV and 11
patients (24%) in the group that did not receive LEV
experienced seizures during the chemotherapy period
(P 5 1.000). The median duration of clinical follow-up
for patients who received LEV was 16.9 months (range,
4.6-49.5 months), and that for patients who did not
receive LEV (the control group) was 15.5 months (range,
2.7-71.5 months; P 5 .932).

was significantly higher than that of patients who did
receive LEV (46% vs 23%; P 5 .001).
Survival Outcome

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to establish the median PFS and OS. For the entire 103-patient cohort, the
median PFS was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval
[CI], 6.9-10.1 months), and the median OS was 20.2
months (95% CI, 15.5-24.9 months). For the patients
who received LEV, the median PFS was 9.4 months (95%
CI, 7.5-11.3 months), and the median OS was 25.7
months (95% CI, 21.7-29.7 months). For the patients
who did not receive LEV, the median PFS was 6.7 months
(95% CI, 5.8-7.6 months), and the median OS was 16.7
months (95% CI, 12.1-21.3 months) (Fig. 2). Both the
median PFS and the median OS for the LEV group were
significantly longer than those for the control group
(P 5 .010 and P 5 .027, respectively). In addition,
patients in the LEV group were categorized into 2 groups;
a low-dose LEV group (1000 mg daily) and a high-dose
LEV group (>1000 mg daily). However, the median PFS
and the median OS between the 2 groups were not statistically different (P 5 .866 and P 5 .339, respectively).
Factors that were identified as prognostic for all 103
patients were evaluated in univariate and multivariate
analyses (Table 3). In the multivariate analysis, only LEV
(P 5 .004; hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.76)
was significantly associated with poorer PFS. The poorer
prognostic factors identified for OS were a preoperative
KPS score 90 (P 5 .016; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.170.83), MGMT promoter methylation status (P 5 .002;
HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.65), and receipt of LEV
(P < .001; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.61).

DISCUSSION
The current study indicates that LEV, a new AED, has
anticancer effects and survival benefits in the management
of glioblastoma. Many clinicians have become interested
in the anticancer effects of AEDs, because many patients
with glioblastoma have received 1 or more AED during
the management and/or follow-up periods.5 If AEDs
actually inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce significant apoptosis of cancer cells, then the administration of
AEDs may be able to accomplish 2 goals with 1 treatment
method in patients with glioblastoma.
Among AEDs, VPA is 1 of the most commonly prescribed drugs during the perioperative period in patients
with brain tumors; therefore, several recently published
reports have evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of
VPA on malignant gliomas.7,8,20,21 In a preclinical
study by Chen et al, VPA synergistically enhanced
temozolomide-induced apoptosis independent of p53 status.20 Moreover, Van Nifterik et al demonstrated that
HDAC inhibition by VPA loosened up the chromatin
structure, consequently increasing DNA accessibility of
cancer cells to temozolomide and enhancing the effect of
c-radiation.7
Recently, a survival benefit of VPA in patients with
glioblastoma has been reported in several clinical studies.8-12 Weller et al evaluated the survival benefit of VPA
compared with other AEDs or no AED in patients who
received either postoperative CCRT with temozolomide
or radiotherapy only.8 When comparing the OS of
patients between the CCRT and radiotherapy-only
groups, those authors demonstrated that the survival benefit of CCRT with temozolomide was most prominent in
the VPA group. However, their study did not prove a

significant gain in survival from VPA in the CCRT group
compared with the gain from other AEDs. After that publication, some retrospective studies demonstrated that the
receipt of VPA together with CCRT plus temozolomide
by patients with glioblastoma resulted in a 2-month longer survival compared with the survival of patients who
received other AEDs.10,11
Currently, LEV is a relatively new and emerging
AED, and it has been widely used as a first-line or secondline treatment for preventing seizures in patients with
brain tumors.5 A comparable seizure-prevention effect
and a lower complication rate compared with that
observed using other drugs have been reported for LEV.13
Moreover, in the preclinical study by Bobustuc et al, LEV
increased the transcription of HDAC1 and recruited the
HDAC1/mSin3A compressor complex to the p53binding site in the MGMT promoter, consequently
silencing MGMT and enhancing the anticancer effect of
temozolomide.4 Therefore, those investigators started
using LEV as an AED for some patients with glioblastoma
during the CCRT and adjuvant chemotherapy periods
with temozolomide.
In the current study, the patients who received LEV
demonstrated significantly better OS and PFS than those
who did not receive LEV. In particular, the difference in
the cumulative rate of PFS between the LEV and control
groups was more definite after the CCRT period, approximately 6 months after diagnosis (Fig. 2, top). However,
the difference in distribution according to disease progression status between the LEV and control groups was noticeable (Fig. 1). The progression rate between the 2
groups during the CCRT period or the follow-up period
was not significantly different; however, the progression
rate in the control group was significantly higher than that
in the LEV group during the adjuvant chemotherapy period. These findings suggest that disease progression in
the LEV group was inhibited by LEV and that LEV
became a chemosensitizer to high-dose temozolomide
(range, 150-200 mg/m2 daily) during the adjuvant chemotherapy period.
The current study has several limitations. First, there
was a certain selection bias because of its retrospective nature. Although the baseline parameters between the LEV
and control groups were not significantly different, several
confounding factors, including older age, fewer preoperative seizures, and a lower rate of gross total removal among
the patients who did not receive LEV, may have influenced survival outcomes (Table 2). Moreover, the number
of patients who completed 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide differed significantly between the LEV and control
Cancer

groups. However, as mentioned above, adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide for all patients in this study
was stopped when disease progression was detected on
follow-up MRI. Therefore, this discrepancy was caused
by the difference in the number of patients who had disease progression identified during the adjuvant temozolomide period; it was not a difference in baseline data but a
difference in treatment outcome between the 2 groups.
Second, long-term follow-up was not performed for
patients in the LEV group. However, because of the relatively short survival duration of patients with glioblastoma, the mean follow-up duration between the 2 groups
was not different. Finally, our risk factor analyses indicted
that MGMT promoter methylation and patient age were
not associated with PFS. MGMT promoter methylation
status was evaluated in only 70 patients, and limited
patient number may have had an effect on the statistical
analyses.
Conclusion

The survival benefits of LEV were suggested first in
patients with glioblastoma who received temozolomidebased chemotherapy. Further prospective, randomized
studies are needed to evaluate the survival benefit of LEV
as a chemosensitizer.
