SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

The embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform is highly expressed in human cancer. In
contrast to the established role of PKM2 in aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect1,2,3, its
nonmetabolic functions remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that EGFR activation induces
translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1, into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Srcphosphorylated Y333 of β-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be recruited to
the CCND1 promoter, leading to HDAC3 removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation, and
cyclin D1 expression. PKM2-dependent β-catenin transactivation is instrumental in EGFRpromoted tumor cell proliferation and brain tumor development. In addition, positive correlations
have been identified among c-Src activity, β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation, and PKM2 nuclear
accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of β-catenin phosphorylation
and nuclear PKM2 have been correlated with grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. These
findings reveal that EGF induces β-catenin transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that
induced by Wnt/wingless4 and highlight the essential nonmetabolic functions of PKM2 in EGFRpromoted β-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis.

Since both EGFR activation and PKM2 expression are instrumental in tumorigenesis5,6,7,
we examined whether EGFR activation regulates PKM2 functions in a subcellular
compartment-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that EGF treatment
resulted in the nuclear accumulation of PKM2 in U87/EGFR human glioblastoma (GBM)
cells (Fig. 1a). In addition, expression of the constitutively active EGFRvIII mutant in U87
cells had a higher amount of nuclear PKM2 than did EGF-untreated U87/EGFR cells
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). The finding that EGF induces nuclear translocation of PKM2 was
further supported by cell fractionation analysis of DU145 prostate cancer cells, MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells, and U87/EGFR cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In addition,
PKM1 failed to translocate into the nucleus upon EGF stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2c),
indicating that EGF specifically regulates the subcellular distribution of PKM2 in multiple
types of cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To examine whether PKM2 directly regulates gene transcription and cell proliferation, we
expressed PKM2 shRNA in U87/EGFR cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). PKM2 depletion
largely reduced both basal and EGF-induced tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 1b) and blocked
EGF-enhanced expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc (Fig. 1c), which are known important
regulators of cell proliferation and downstream genes of β-catenin transactivation8. To
examine whether these PKM2-dependent effects were mediated by β-catenin, we performed
TCF/LEF-1 luciferase reporter analyses, showing that PKM2 depletion significantly
inhibited EGF-induced β-catenin transactivation (Fig. 1d). In addition, chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses showed that EGFR activation resulted in increased
binding of β-catenin to the promoter region of CCND1 (coding for cyclin D1) (Fig. 1e) and
c-myc (data not shown), which was blocked by PKM2 depletion. In addition,
coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses showed that PKM2 depletion inhibited EGFinduced interaction between β-catenin and Myc-tagged TCF4 (Fig. 1f). However, PKM2
depletion failed to inhibit Wnt3a- or Wnt1- (data not shown) induced β-catenin
transactivation (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and cyclin D1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
In addition, Wnt3a did not induce PKM2 nuclear translocation (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
These results indicate that EGF induces β-catenin transactivation via a mechanism distinct
from that induced by Wnt/wingless4 and that PKM2 expression plays a pivotal role in EGF-,
but not Wnt-induced β-catenin transactivation.

Author Manuscript

To examine the mechanism underlying PKM2-regulated β-catenin transactivation, we
performed co-IP analyses, showing that EGF stimulation resulted in an interaction between
endogenous PKM2 and β-catenin in the nuclear, but not cytosolic, fraction of U87/EGFR
cells (Fig. 1g). However, an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay
showed that purified GST-β-catenin failed to bind to purified His-PKM2 (Supplementary
Fig. 4). These results suggest that the interaction of these two proteins might require posttranslational modifications of the proteins.

PKM2 binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, and expression of the phosphotyrosinebinding form is required for cancer cell growth9. To examine whether β-catenin is tyrosinephosphorylated, we performed immunoblotting analyses with a phospho-Tyr antibody,
showing that EGF stimulation induced Tyr phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated βcatenin in the nucleus, but not in the cytosol or at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1h). Treatment
of the immunoprecipitated β-catenin with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) resulted
in β-catenin dephosphorylation and abrogation of the PKM2–β-catenin interaction (Fig. 1i).
Thus, EGF-induced Tyr-phosphorylation of β-catenin is required for the PKM2–β-catenin
interaction.

Author Manuscript

PKM2 K433E mutant, which fails to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides9, had similar
glycolytic enzyme activity to its WT counterpart (Supplementary Fig. 5)9. Co-IP analyses
showed that EGF treatment induced the binding of β-catenin to FLAG-tagged wild-type
(WT) PKM2, but not to the PKM2 K433E mutant (Fig. 1j). In contrast, a kinase-dead
FLAG-PKM2 K367M10,11, acting like its WT counterpart, binds to β-catenin (Fig. 1k).
These results indicate that the K433 binding residue of PKM2, but not its catalytic activity,
is critical for the PKM2–β-catenin interaction.

ABL and Src have been reported to phosphorylate β-catenin12,13. Pretreatment with SU6656
(Src inhibitor) or an ABL inhibitor completely abrogated EGF-induced activation of c-Src or
ABL, as shown by the reduced levels of c-Src (Y418) or ABL (Y412) phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, inhibition of c-Src, but not ABL, blocked EGF-induced
Tyr phosphorylation of β-catenin (Fig. 2a). In addition, deficiency of c-Src (Fig. 2b), but not
of ABL (Supplementary Fig. 6b), abrogated EGF-induced β-catenin Tyr-phosphorylation
and the PKM2–β-catenin interaction. These results indicate that c-Src, a downstream
effector of EGFR, phosphorylates β-catenin, which is required for the PKM2–β-catenin
interaction.
To examine the subcellular compartment in which c-Src phosphorylates β-catenin, we
conducted fractionation analyses. We found that EGF stimulation resulted in the nuclear
translocation of c-Src (Supplementary Fig. 6c). In addition, co-IP analyses showed that EGF
treatment induced an enhanced interaction between β-catenin and c-Src in nuclear fractions
(Fig. 2c). These results, combined with the evidence that β-catenin is phosphorylated in the
nucleus (Fig. 1h), strongly suggest that c-Src translocates into the nucleus and subsequently
interacts with and phosphorylates β-catenin.

Author Manuscript

The Y86 residue of β-catenin has been shown to be phosphorylated by Src as well as BcrABL12,13, and analysis of the amino acid sequence identified an additional potential Src
phosphorylation site at Y333. Immunoblotting analysis showed that EGF stimulation
resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin and β-catenin Y86F, but
not β-catenin Y333F, which was further validated by immunoblotting with a phospho-βcatenin Y333 antibody (Fig. 2d). In addition, cell fractionation analysis demonstrated that
EGF induced β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation primarily in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig.
6d). Furthermore, an in vitro protein kinase assay showed that active c-Src was able to
phosphorylate WT β-catenin (Fig. 2e), but the β-catenin Y333F mutation largely reduced

total Tyr-phosphorylation levels and completely abrogated the Y333-phosphorylation. These
results reveal that c-Src binds and phosphorylates β-catenin at Y333 in vitro and in vivo.
To examine whether phosphorylation of β-catenin Y333 regulates its binding to PKM2, we
performed a GST pull-down assay by mixing purified GST-β-catenin and His-PKM2 with or
without purified active c-Src. Fig. 2f shows that WT PKM2 did not bind to
unphosphorylated WT β-catenin. However, the presence of c-Src enabled the binding of WT
PKM2 to β-catenin, which was abrogated by mutation of β-catenin at Y333 or PKM2 at
K433. These in vitro results were further validated by co-IP analyses, showing that in
contrast to FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin or β-catenin Y86F, FLAG-β-catenin Y333F failed to
bind to endogenous PKM2 (Fig. 2g). These results indicate that c-Src-mediated β-catenin
Y333 phosphorylation is required for the PKM2–β-catenin interaction.

We next examined the significance of the PKM2–β-catenin interaction in β-catenin
transactivation. Fig. 3a shows that FLAG-β-catenin Y333F failed to interact with Myctagged TCF4 upon EGF stimulation, in contrast to its WT counterpart. ChIP analyses
demonstrated that FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin bound to the CCND1 promoter region upon
EGFR activation, which was abrogated by the Y333F mutation (Fig. 3b). In addition,
reconstituted expression of the RNAi-resistant β-catenin (rβ-catenin) Y333F mutant, but not
of WT rβ-catenin, in endogenous β-catenin-depleted U87/EGFRvIII cells failed to induce
cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, FLAG-PKM2 K433E and the
inactive FLAG-PKM2 K367M mutant translocated into the nucleus upon EGF stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. 7), but reconstituted expression of these mutants (Supplementary Fig.
8) failed to induce cyclin D1 expression as did WT rPKM2 expression (Fig. 3d). Thus, both
PKM2 catalytic activity and the PKM2–β-catenin interaction are required for cyclin D1
expression upon EGFR activation.
To compare downstream targets of EGF and Wnt signaling, we examined the expression of
other Wnt/β-catenin downstream genes: AXIN2, DKK1, and βTrCP8. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis showed that EGF treatment increased mRNA levels of DKK1, but not of AXIN2 or
βTrCP, which was blocked by PKM2 depletion (Supplementary Fig. 9). These results
indicate that EGF-induced and PKM2-dependent β-catenin transactivation induced
transcription of a set of genes, which do not completely overlap with those induced by Wnt
signaling.

Author Manuscript

The findings that PKM2 was not required for Wnt3a-induced β-catenin transactivation
(Supplementary Fig. 3b) suggested that c-Src-dependent β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation is
not involved in Wnt-induced signaling or cell adhesion. This assumption was supported by
the results, showing that β-catenin Y333F behaved similarly to WT β-catenin in binding to
APC, AXIN2, and E-cadherin and in Wnt-induced β-catenin transactivation and cellular
functions (Supplementary Fig. 10, a-g). In contrast, expression of β-catenin Y333F blocked
EGF- but not Wnt3a-induced cell migration (Supplementary Fig. 10h).
To investigate the mechanisms underlying PKM2- and β-catenin-dependent cyclin D1
expression, we performed ChIP analyses. Fig. 3e shows that EGF induced an enhanced
binding of WT FLAG-PKM2 and FLAG-PKM2 K367M, but not of FLAG-PKM2 K433E,

to the CCND1 promoter region. In addition, binding of FLAG-PKM2 to the promoter region
was not detected in ChIP analyses after β-catenin had been immunodepleted from cell
lysates (Fig. 3f). These results indicate that the PKM2–β-catenin interaction, but not PKM2
kinase activity, is required for both proteins to bind to the CCND1 promoter region.
We next examined whether PKM2 binding to the CCND1 promoter region regulates histone
H3 acetylation, which is important for gene transcription. ChIP analyses showed that EGF
treatment resulted in a significant increase of histone H3 acetylation in the CCND1 promoter
region, which was blocked by PKM2 depletion (Fig. 3g). Reconstituted expression of
rPKM2 K433E and the inactive rPKM2 K367M mutant failed to restore EGF-induced
histone H3 acetylation, compared with the WT protein.

Author Manuscript

To further understand the mechanism underlying PKM2-regulated histone H3 acetylation,
we performed ChIP analyses with antibodies against ubiquitously expressed histone
deacetylase (HDAC)1, HDAC2, and HDAC314. Fig. 3h shows that HDAC3, but not
HDAC1 or HDAC2 (Supplementary Fig. 11a), was prebound to the CCND1 promoter. EGF
treatment resulted in the disassociation of HDAC3 from the CCND1 promoter, and this
disassociation was blocked by PKM2 depletion. Furthermore, reconstituted expression of
WT rPKM2, but not of rPKM2 K367M or rPKM2 K433E mutants, was able to restore EGFinduced disassociation of HDAC3 from the promoter (Fig. 3h). These results indicate that
the kinase activity of PKM2 and its binding with β-catenin to the CCND1 promoter region
are required for HDAC3 removal from the promoter. An additional co-IP analysis showed
that WT PKM2, but not PKM2 K367M, interacted with HDAC3 upon EGF treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). These results suggest that PKM2 can interact with HDAC3 in an
active conformation, which facilitates HDAC3 removal from the CCND1 promoter,
acetylation of histone H3, and cyclin D1 expression.
To support the findings that EGF-induced and c-Src-dependent PKM2–β-catenin interaction
and subsequent cyclin D1 expression are not cell line-specific, we treated GSC11 and
GSC23 human primary GBM cells with EGF. Supplementary Fig. 12a shows that EGF
treatment results in nuclear translocation of PKM2 and cyclin D1 expression in these cells.
In addition, EGF-induced phosphorylation of β-catenin Y333 (Supplementary Fig. 12b) and
its association with PKM2 (Supplementary Fig. 12c) were blocked by pretreatment with
SU6656.

We next examined the significance of the PKM2–β-catenin interaction in tumor cell
proliferation. Fig. 4a shows that U87/EGFRvIII cells proliferated much faster than did
parental U87 cells. Expression of β-catenin shRNA (Fig. 3c) largely inhibited U87/
EGFRvIII cell proliferation, which was rescued by reconstituted expression of WT rβcatenin, but not of the rβ-catenin Y333F mutant (Fig. 4a). In addition, EGFRvIII-promoted
cell proliferation was similarly inhibited by PKM2 depletion, which was rescued by the
reconstituted expression of WT rPKM2, but not of the rPKM2 K433E or rPKM2 K367M
mutant (Supplementary Fig. 13a and Fig. 4b).
β-catenin-regulated cyclin D1 expression is critical for G1-S phase transition and cell cycle
progression15. Depletion of β-catenin or PKM2 resulted in an accumulation of U87/

EGFRvIII cells in G0/G1 phase, which was rescued by reconstituted expression of WT rβcatenin or WT rPKM2, but not of the rβ-catenin Y333F or rPKM2 K433E mutant
(Supplementary Fig. 13b). Thus, the PKM2–β-catenin interaction is essential for cell cycle
progression.

Author Manuscript

To determine the role of PKM2-dependent β-catenin transactivation in brain tumor
development, we intracranially injected U87 or U87/EGFRvIII cells into athymic nude mice.
U87 cells did not form a detectable tumor two weeks after injection (Fig. 4c, bottom left
panel). In contrast, U87/EGFRvIII cells elicited rapid tumorigenesis (Fig. 4c, top left panel).
Notably, depletion of β-catenin (top panel) or PKM2 (bottom panel) abrogated EGFRvIIIdriven tumor growth, which was rescued by expression of WT rβ-catenin or WT rPKM2, but
not of the rβ-catenin Y333F or rPKM2 K433E mutant. Similar results were obtained using
GSC11 cells (Supplementary Fig. 14a). In addition, adding doxycycline to the drinking
water 14 days after intracranial injection of GSC11 cells that expressed a tetracyclineinducible PKM2 shRNA partially depleted PKM2 expression in tumor tissues and inhibited
tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 14b). Thus, the PKM2–β-catenin interaction and PKM2
expression is instrumental in tumor growth.

Author Manuscript

To further support the role of c-Src in EGFR-induced β-catenin transactivation in vivo, we
injected SU6656 intratumorally, which significantly blocked tumor growth (Supplementary
Figs. 15a and 15b), reduced the phosphorylation levels of c-Src Y418 and β-catenin Y333,
and inhibited cyclin D1 expression in tumor tissue (Supplementary Fig. 15c). The
requirement of β-catenin transactivation in tumorigenesis was also examined by expression
of Wnt1 in U87/EGFRvIII-PKM2 shRNA cells. Wnt1 expression resulted in the induction
of cyclin D1 (Supplementary Fig. 16a) and largely rescued PKM2 depletion-blocked
tumorigenesis (Supplementary Figs. 16b and 16c). In addition, this effect was further
enhanced using Wnt1-expressing U87/EGFRvIII cells with reconstituted expression of
rPKM2 K433E, which retains its catalytic activity for glycolysis. These results suggest that,
while the metabolic function of PKM2 plays a critical role in aerobic glycolysis7 and
tumorigenesis, brain tumor development promoted by EGFR requires PKM2-modulated βcatenin transactivation.
Analysis of publicly available microarray datasets (Affymetrix, U133) from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other sources16,17,18,19 revealed a correlation of c-myc and
CCND1 expression with EGFR expression in GBM samples (Supplementary Fig. 17). In
addition, phosphorylation levels of β-catenin Y333 correlated with phosphorylation levels of
activated c-Src in seven human primary GBM cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 18).

Author Manuscript

We next performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to examine c-Src activity, βcatenin Y333 phosphorylation, and PKM2 nuclear localization in serial sections of 55
human primary GBM specimens by using antibodies with validated specificities
(Supplementary Fig. 19). Fig. 4d shows that the levels of c-Src Y418 phosphorylation, βcatenin Y333 phosphorylation, and nuclear PKM2 expression were correlated with each
other. In addition, β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation accumulated in the nuclei of a large
percentage of tumor cells (Fig. 4d, left panel). Quantification of the staining on a scale of 0
to 8.0 showed that these correlations were significant (Supplementary Fig. 20). The survival

durations of 84 patients, all of whom received standard adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery,
followed by treatment with an alkylating agent (temozolomide in the majority of cases),
with low (0-5 staining) versus high (5.1-8 staining) β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation and
nuclear PKM2 expression were compared. Patients whose tumors had low β-catenin Y333
phosphorylation or nuclear PKM2 expression had a median survival of 185.2 and 130.0
weeks, respectively. The median survival of patients decreased to 69.4 and 82.5 weeks,
respectively, when their tumors showed high levels of β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation or
nuclear PKM2 expression. In a Cox multivariate model, the IHC score of β-catenin
phosphorylation (Fig. 4e) and nuclear PKM2 expression (Fig. 4f) were independent
predictors of glioblastoma patient survival, after adjusting for the age of the patient, a
relevant clinical covariate. These results support the role of PKM2 association with c-Srcphosphorylated β-catenin Y333 in the clinical behavior of human GBM and reveal a
relationship between β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation/nuclear PKM2 localization and
clinical aggressiveness of the tumor. These findings were further supported by IHC
analyses, showing significantly lower levels of β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation in lowgrade diffuse astrocytoma (30 cases) (World Health Organization [WHO] grade II; median
survival time >5 years) than were present in GBM specimens (WHO grade IV)20
(Supplementary Fig. 21).

We previously showed that GSK-3β–independent transactivation of β-catenin by growth
factor receptor occurs by mechanisms distinct from Wnt-dependent canonical
signaling4,21-23. In this study, we describe an important and previously unknown mechanism
underlying EGFR activation-induced β-catenin transactivation through interaction with
PKM2, which plays a critical role in transcription of CCND1 and c-myc (Supplementary Fig.
1). The understanding that phosphorylation of β-catenin Y333 and its interaction with PKM2
are required for tumor cell proliferation and tumor development, and that the levels of βcatenin Y333 phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 correlate with grades of glioma
malignancy and prognosis, may provide a molecular basis for improved diagnosis and
treatment of tumors with activated EGFR and upregulated PKM2. In summary, our findings,
in combination with previous reports7,24, delineate two essential mechanisms underlying
tumor development by regulation of metabolic and nonmetabolic functions of PKM2: 1)
PKM2 enhances aerobic glycolysis7,24 and 2) PKM2 promotes tumor cell proliferation by
binding to and transactivating Y333-phosphorylated β-catenin. Thus, PKM2 has dual roles
that are essential for tumorigenesis: regulating cancer cell metabolism and gene transcription
required for cell proliferation. The coordinated control of metabolism and proliferation by
PKM2 is essential for tumorigenesis.

expression of rβ-catenin (a), or U87/EGFRvIII cells with or without depleted PKM2 and
reconstitution of the expression of rPKM2 (b), were plated and counted 7 days after seeding.
Data represent the means ± SD of three independent experiments.
c, U87 (bottom left panel), U87/EGFRvIII cells with or without depleted β-catenin and
reconstituted expression of rβ-catenin (top panel), or U87/EGFRvIII cells with or without
depleted PKM2 and reconstituted expression of rPKM2 (bottom right panel) were
intracranially injected into athymic nude mice. After two weeks, tumor growth was
examined. H&E-stained coronal brain sections show representative tumor xenografts.
d, IHC staining with the indicated antibodies was performed on 55 GBM specimens.
Representative photos of four tumors are shown.
