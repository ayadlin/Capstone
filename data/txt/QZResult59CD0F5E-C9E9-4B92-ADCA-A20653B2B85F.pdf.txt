Abstract

Author Manuscript

The heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatase (SULF2) promotes growth and metastasis of solid tumors.
We recently identified that cytosine methylation of the SULF2 promoter is associated with better
survival of resected lung adenocarcinoma patients and now also demonstrate a marginal
improvement in survival of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving
standard chemotherapy (HR = 0.63, p = 0.07). Subsequent studies focused on investigating the
effect of methylation on SULF2 expression and its genome-wide impact. The genes and pathways
modulated by epigenetic inactivation of SULF2 and the effects on sensitivity to chemotherapy
were characterized in vitro and in vivo. Silencing SULF2 through siRNA or methylation primarily
increased expression of interferon-inducible genes including ISG15, a marker for increased
sensitivity to topoisomerase-1 inhibitors such as camptothecin. NSCLC cell lines with methylated
SULF2 (SULF2M) express 60-fold higher ISG15 compared to SULF2 unmethylated (SULF2U)
NSCLC cell lines and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. In vitro, SULF2M and high ISG15
(ISG15H) expressing NSCLC cell lines were 134-fold more sensitive to camptothecin than
SULF2U and low ISG15 (ISG15L) expressing cell lines. Topotecan, a soluble analogue of
camptothecin and FDA approved anti-cancer drug, dramatically arrested the growth of SULF2MISG15H, but not SULF2U-ISG15L lung tumors in nude mice (p < 0.002). Similarly, high ISG15
expression that is comparable to the topotecan sensitive NSCLC cell lines was found in tumors

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are ubiquitously distributed on cell membrane and
extracellular matrix (ECM) and play a critical role in the interaction between cells and their
environment (Bishop et al., 2007). Cell surface HSPGs directly interact with the heparan
sulfate (HS) domain of cell adhesion molecules in the ECM (e.g. fibronectin) and direct cell
attachment and migration. Membrane-spanning HSPGs (e.g. syndicans) are composed of a
transmembrane core protein covalently linked with an extracellular HS chain and serve as
receptors or co-receptors for various signaling molecules. The plethora of ligands interacting
with HSPGs and implicated in carcinogenesis include growth factors (GF) and cytokines
such as fibroblast GF (FGF), vascular endothelial GF (VEGF), and Wnt proteins (Lai et al.,
2010; Uchimura et al., 2006). The specificity of HSPG-ligand interaction is determined by
the composition and sulfation pattern of the HS polysaccharide chain. HS sulfation is
dynamically regulated, tissue specific, and precise positioning of the 6-O sulfates in
particular is important for ligand interaction (Merry et al., 1999; Sugaya et al., 2008).

Two extracellular enzymes, SULF1 and SULF2, regulate the distribution of 6‐O sulfates in
humans by selectively removing sulfate groups from the 6-O position (Morimoto-Tomita et
al., 2002). Abnormalities in the expression of these 6-O-endosulfatases have been associated
with various malignancies. SULF2 promotes the release of growth and angiogenic factors
such as FGF-I, FGF-2, VEGF, and DSF-I from HS and is over expressed in some lung,
breast, brain, and liver cancers (Johansson et al., 2005; Lai et al., 2008; Lemjabbar-Alaoui et
al., 2010; Morimoto-Tomita et al., 2005; Uchimura et al., 2006). In hepatocellular carcinoma
SULF2 expression increases with disease progression and patients with higher expression
have lower survival and a more rapid rate of tumor recurrence after surgery (Lai et al.,
2008). Inactivation of SULF2 using short hairpin RNA reduces cell proliferation and
migration (Lemjabbar-Alaoui et al., 2010).

We recently identified that promoter CpG island methylation of SULF2, the gene encoding
SULF2 endosulfatase, is highly prevalent in resected lung adenocarcinomas and is
significantly associated with better survival (Tessema et al., 2009). The median overall
survival (OS) of patients with methylated SULF2 (SULF2M) was 62.8 months compared to
35.1 months in SULF2 unmethylated (SULF2U) patients with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41. A
more dramatic (> 4-fold) increase in median OS from 8.5 months in SULF2U to 36.2
months in SULF2M patients was found in resected advanced stage (Stage II-IV) patients
(HR = 0.23; p < 0.001) (Tessema et al., 2009). However, the prognostic importance of
SULF2 methylation for the majority of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (>

80%) who have advanced disease and treatment relies on chemo- and radiation-therapy is
unknown.
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and prognostic value of SULF2
methylation in unresectable NSCLC patients receiving chemo- and radiation-therapy. The
effect of SULF2 silencing on cancer phenotypes were characterized in vitro. Genome-wide
changes in gene expression and the pathways regulated by epigenetic inactivation of SULF2
were also identified through a whole-genome screen. Finally the importance of SULF2
methylation and the genes it regulates as biomarkers for selecting the most effective
chemotherapeutic agent was determined through in vitro and in vivo studies, and the
potential use of identified markers for patient selection and personalized therapy was
discussed.

Results
SULF2 methylation is common in lung cancer and silences gene expression

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We recently reported that SULF2 methylation is highly prevalent and strongly associated
with improved survival of resected lung adenocarcinoma patients independent of tumor
stage (Tessema et al., 2009). To understand the impact of this epigenetic modification in
lung cancer, we first evaluated its role on gene expression using normal human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBEC) and NSCLC cell lines. SULF2 is unmethylated (SULF2U) and
readily expressed in all HBEC and some NSCLC cell lines such as Calu-3, H2085, and
A549 (Figure 1A). In contrast, SULF2 expression was completely silenced in NSCLC cell
lines with densely methylated SULF2 promoter (SULF2M) such as H358, SKLU1 and
H1975. Transcription could be restored in SULF2M cell lines primarily through treatment
with the demethylating agent DAC and partial re-expression was induced in some TSA (a
histone deacetylase inhibitor) treated cell lines. Among the NSCLC cell lines used in this
study, expression of SULF2 in Calu-3, A549 and Calu-6, and its absence in H1975, H358,
and H1299 has been recently demonstrated at transcript and protein levels (LemjabbarAlaoui et al., 2010). Our results confirmed these findings and revealed for the first time that
promoter CpG island methylation is responsible for SULF2 silencing in these cell lines.
Overall, SULF2 was unmethylated in NHBEC obtained from bronchoscopy of cancer free
smokers (0/20) and HBEC (0/5) but methylated in 44% (8/18) of NSCLC cell lines.
Similarly, primary lung tumors obtained from two independent groups of NSCLC patients,
ECOG3598 and PCC, showed 60% (47/78) and 43% (25/58) methylation, respectively. The
density and distribution of methylation across SULF2 promoter CpG island was assessed for
selected samples representing the different sample types and degrees of methylation using
bisulfite sequencing. The results were consistent with MSP and COBRA findings, and
revealed that the methylation pattern across the promoter CpG island of a given sample was
mostly similar (Figure 1B).
SULF2 methylation is associated with improved overall survival of NSCLC
Survival data was available for ECOG3598 patients. Consistent with our previous
observation that was obtained from an independent group of resected lung adenocarcinoma
patients (Tessema et al., 2009), the overall survival (OS) of unresectable NSCLC patients

with SULF2M tumor was marginally better than patients with SULF2U tumor independent
of stage (p = 0.07). The median OS of SULF2M cases (n = 47) was 17.2 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 12.7 – 29.0) compared to 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.6 – 20.8) for
SULF2U patients (n = 31) with a HR = 0.63 (95% CI, 0.39 – 1.04) (Figure 2). Adjustment
for stage (IIIa vs. IIIb), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), performance status (0 vs. 1),
gender, and weight loss (< 5% vs. other) have very little effect on the prognostic value of
SULF2M (HR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.41 – 1.15). While OS was marginally significant, more
SULF2M patients (38.3%, 95% CI, 26.6 – 55.1%) survived beyond two years compared to
SULF2U patients (19.4%, 95% CI, 9.4 – 39.7%; Figure 2). Although the median progression
free survival (PFS) of 7.8 months for SULF2M (95% CI, 6.6 – 10.7) was slightly better than
7.2 months seen for SULF2U patients (95% CI, 5.1 – 11.4), it did not reach statistical
significance (logrank test, p = 0.27; and HR = 0.77, 0.48 –1.23). The response rate
(complete or partial remission, CR/PR) and disease control rate (stable disease/CR/PR)
among SULF2M and SULF2U patients were also similar suggesting that SULF2 methylation
does not directly affect sensitivity of ECOG3598 participants to carboplatin/paclitaxel
combination therapy. Consistent with this premise, the IC50 of cisplatin, carboplatin, or
paclitaxel for NSCLC cell lines in vitro was not associated with SULF2 methylation status
(Table S1).
Epigenetic silencing of SULF2 activates interferon (INF)-inducible genes

Author Manuscript

Calu-3 and A549 cell lines (where SULF2 is unmethylated and expressed) were transfected
with control (siControl) or SULF2 specific siRNA (siSULF2) to evaluate the effect of
epigenetic inactivation of SULF2 on cancer cell phenotypes (cell proliferation, survival, and
migration). Compared to siControl, siSULF2 reduced SULF2 expression in Calu-3 cells by
80% (Figure 3A, p < 0.02) and significantly reduced wound closure (Figure S1A-B, p <
0.005). Similarly, slower wound closure was seen in A549 cells transfected with siSULF2
than siControl (Figure S1C, p < 0.005). However, SULF2 knockdown in both cell lines did
not significantly change cell proliferation and survival (not shown).

Author Manuscript

The genome-wide impact of epigenetic silencing of SULF2 was compared between
siControl and siSULF2 transfected cells using a whole-genome transcriptome array and the
pathways modulated were identified using the MetaCore pathway analysis software from
GeneGo Inc (St. Joseph, MI). Overall, SULF2 knockdown altered the expression of 286
genes by ≥ 1.5-fold and primarily affected (p < 0.005) the immune response, cell cycle
regulation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and DNA-damage response pathways (Figure 3B).
The array data for SULF2 expression in siSULF2 transfected cells (0.23, Table S2) also
confirmed the ∼80% knockdown of this gene seen from TaqMan assays (Figure 3A) and
served as an internal control. Interestingly, one third (11/33) of the genes whose expression
was increased by ≥ 2-fold and have known or predicted function were INF-inducible genes
(Table 1). However, none of the INF-family genes were transcriptionally activated,
suggesting an indirect regulation. Among the INF-inducible genes, expression of the top
four (IFI6, IFI27, ISG15, and MX1) and the upstream regulator of INF-pathway (IRF7) was
measured using quantitative TaqMan assays, normalized to β‐actin, quantified relative to
expression in NHBEC as described (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) and compared between
SULF2U (n = 8) and SULF2M (n = 6) lung cancer cell lines (Figure 3C). The mean

expression of these genes in SULF2M cancer cell lines was increased by 25- to 125-fold (p <
0.01 each). In contrast, consistent with the dense methylation throughout the promoter CpG
island and complete silencing of SULF2 observed in these cell lines (Figure 1A and 1B), the
mean SULF2 expression was reduced by 845-fold (Figure 3C).
SULF2 methylation sensitizes NSCLC cells to camptothecin via ISG15

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previous studies have demonstrated that INF-inducible regulator of ubiquitination (ISG15)
interferes with the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway and increases the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase-I (TOPO1) inhibitor (Desai et al.,
2006; Desai et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008). Our data revealed that SULF2U NSCLC cell lines
(n = 8) express similar level of ISG15 to HBEC (n = 5). In contrast, SULF2M NSCLC cell
lines (n = 6) was on average express 60-fold higher ISG15 than SULF2U cells (Figure 3D).
The strong association between SULF2M and high ISG15 (ISG15H) phenotypes prompted
us to test if SULF2M and ISG15H NSCLC cells could also show increased sensitivity to
CPT and its analogues. The average dose of CPT required to kill 50% (IC50) of SULF2MISG15H cell lines H358, SKLU1 and H1975 was 0.12, 0.17, and 0.25 μM, respectively. In
contrast, the IC50 for SULF2U-ISG15low (ISG15L) cell lines Calu-3, A549, and H2085 was
3.39, 13.38, and 55.48 μM, respectively (Figure 4A). This indicates that SULF2M-ISG15H
cell lines are on average 134-fold (IC50 = 0.18 vs. 24.08 μM) more sensitive to CPT than
SULF2U-ISG15L NSCLC cell lines. Similarly, knockdown of 90% and 85% of SULF2 in
Calu-3 and A549 increased the sensitivity of these cells to CPT by 5.6- and 4.1-fold,
respectively (Figure 4B-D). In contrast, SULF2 expression remained undetectable in both
siControl and siSULF2 transfected H358 and H1975 (not shown) and the sensitivity of both
cell lines to CPT did not change substantially following transfection (Figure 4E and F).
Whereas knockdown of SULF2 in Calu-3 and A549 increased ISG15 expression by 6.7- and
3.1-fold, respectively, no significant difference was found between siSULF2 or siControl
transfected H358 and H1975 cells (Figure S2).
SULF2M-ISG15H tumors are sensitive to topotecan in vivo

Author Manuscript

The in vivo effectiveness of TOPO1 inhibitors to suppress the growth of human NSCLC
xenografts was evaluated using the soluble CPT analogue, topotecan (TPT). The SULF2MISG15H cell line H1975 that is resistant to both platinum therapy and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (due to an activating L858R and drug resistance T790M EGFR mutations,
respectively) and the K‐ras mutant SULF2U-ISG15L A549 were selected for this study due
to the commonality of these mutations in primary NSCLC (Helfrich et al., 2006; Kalikaki et
al., 2008). Once-a-week 10 mg/kg TPT therapy of nude mice carrying subcutaneous
xenografts of these cell lines was well tolerated and dramatically arrested the growth of
H1975 tumors (p < 0.002), but had little effect (p = 0.58) on A549 tumors (Figure 5A and
B). A separate experiment comparing the efficacy of TPT, cisplatin, and TPT-cisplatin
combination therapy revealed that cisplatin has marginal impact (p = 0.054) on reducing the
growth of H1975 xenografts. In contrast, TPT alone, or in combination with cisplatin
significantly arrested the growth of H1975 tumors (p = 0.001). TPT therapy alone was
superior to cisplatin and adding cisplatin to TPT treatments had no additional benefit in
suppressing H1975 xenografts (Figure 5C).

ISG15 expression is elevated in a subset of primary lung tumors

Author Manuscript

RNA for gene expression analysis was available for 10 NHBEC, 58 tumors and 12 distant
normal lung tissues (DNLT) obtained from NSCLC patients. To address the relationship
between EGFR mutation and high ISG15 expression observed in some lung adenocarcinoma
cell lines (e.g. H1975 and HCC827), 29 EGFR wild-type (EGFRwt) and 29 mutant
(EGFRmut) primary tumors were analyzed. The prevalence for SULF2 methylation was
similar between EGFRwt (13/29) and EGFRmut (12/29) tumors. Gene expression assays
revealed that the ISG15 level in DNLT was on average 7.1-fold (2.9 – 15.6) higher and
showed more variation between samples than in NHBEC (0.37 – 1.64), likely due to
different levels of expression within the multiple cell types comprising the lung parenchyma
(Figure 5D). The mean expression of ISG15 in the primary tumors was 15.6 and 2.2-fold
higher than NHBEC and DNLT, respectively. A much larger variation in ISG15 expression
ranging from 0.5 – 73-fold was also found between tumors. Expression did not differ by
EGFR mutation status and surprisingly, was not significantly associated with SULF2
methylation indicating other regulators of ISG15 expression [e.g. cytokines from infiltrating
inflammatory cells (Andersen et al., 2006)] potentially contribute to the discrepancy
between the pure cell population (NHBEC, HBEC, and NSCLC cell lines) and primary
tissue (DNLC and tumors from patients). However, the level of ISG15 expression within the
tumors clearly separates NSCLC patients into two distinct subpopulations, ISG15L and
ISG15H (Figure 5A). Tumors from 75% of NSCLC patients (44/58) express lower levels of
ISG15 (ISG15L) (mean 7.7-fold and median 7.5-fold relative to NHBEC) that was similar to
DNLT (mean 7.1-fold and median 5.2-fold). In contrast, tumors from 25% of NSCLC
patients (14/58) express much higher ISG15 (mean 42-fold and median 36-fold) that was
comparable to the TPT sensitive NSCLC cell lines, representing an ISG15H subpopulation
that could benefit from personalized therapy with TOPO1 inhibitors approved for cancer
therapy such as topotecan (Hycamtin®, GlaxoSmithKline) and Irinotecan (Camptosar®,
Pfizer).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

These studies confirm that SULF2 methylation is a common abnormality and a prognostic
biomarker for better survival of lung cancer patients. In addition, epigenetic silencing of
SULF2 via promoter methylation or siRNA in cancer cell lines significantly increased
expression of multiple INF-inducible genes, one of which, ISG15 sensitizes NSCLC cells to
the topoisomerase-1 inhibitors, CPT and TPT. In nude mice, TPT therapy is associated with
a dramatic reduction in the growth of tumors derived from the SULF2M-ISG15H line H1975
that harbors EGFR mutations rendering it resistant to both platinum-based and tyrosine
kinase inhibitory drugs (Kobayashi et al., 2005; Pao et al., 2005). Importantly, although
SULF2 methylation was not strongly associated with increased expression of ISG15 in
primary tumors, 25% of NSCLC patients had tumors with elevated expression of this gene at
levels comparable to cell lines sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, suggesting that this
subset of patients could benefit from personalized TPT therapy.
The improved survival of SULF2M patients in ECOG3598 did not appear to be mediated
through increased sensitivity to carboplatin or paclitaxel. Rather, epigenetic suppression of

the oncogenic pathways triggered through this enzyme is the likely cause. This assessment is
based on multiple findings. First, both the response and disease control rates among NSCLC
patients receiving a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy as well as the in vitro
sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines to these drugs were not associated with SULF2
methylation status. Second, as shown in our previous study, SULF2 methylation was also
strongly associated with survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients after surgery (Tessema et
al., 2009). Finally, higher SULF2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma is also associated
with worse prognosis and higher recurrence after surgery (Lai et al., 2008). SULF2
expression in tumors exhibits the behavior of an oncogene by mobilizing heparin/heparan
sulfate bound growth factors and promoting pathways such as FGF and Wnt signaling
leading to increased tumor growth and angiogenesis (Lai et al., 2008; Lemjabbar-Alaoui et
al., 2010; Uchimura et al., 2006). In vitro inactivation of SULF2 suppresses these pathways
and decreases growth of lung, liver, breast, and pancreatic tumors (Lai et al., 2008;
Lemjabbar-Alaoui et al., 2010; Morimoto-Tomita et al., 2005; Nawroth et al., 2007), effects
that should reduce the aggressiveness of tumors a supposition supported by the more
significant improvement in overall survival seen in patients with resected compared to
unresected lung cancer. Currently, the mechanism or selective advantage of silencing
SULF2 in cancer cells remains to be identified.

Author Manuscript

Epigenetic inactivation of SULF2, as demonstrated by the siRNA knockdown and genomewide array, primarily activated INF-inducible genes. Consistent with the function of the
INF-pathway to trigger immune response against tumors, six of the eight most significantly
affected pathways regulate cell-differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and immune
response. However, this increase in the expression of INF-inducible genes occurred with no
change in the transcription of the INF family genes suggesting SULF2 enzyme may
negatively regulate the activity and/or bioavailability of these cytokines. HSPGs and HS
present on the cell surface and ECM bind INF-γ (and possibly INF-α/β) with high affinity
(Kd = 5 nM) using two highly sulfated sequences each binding to one INF-γ monomer
(Lortat-Jacob et al., 1991). Thus, SULF2-mediated removal of sulfate groups from these
sequences could prevent INF‐γ binding and suppress the downstream effects without
changing the transcription of the cytokine. Furthermore, unbound INF-γ is rapidly degraded
through C-terminal processing to prevent undesired effects of the cytokine to the
surrounding tissue (Lortat-Jacob et al., 1991). Epigenetic silencing of SULF2 could prevent
the removal of the sulfate groups from INF-binding sites, maintain the high affinity binding
and activity, prevent degradation, increase bioavailability of the cytokine, and as shown in
this study increase transcription of multiple INF-inducible genes.

The increased sensitivity of SULF2M-ISG15H lung cancer cell lines and xenograft to
topoisomerase-1 (TOPO1) inhibitors appears to be mediated through ISG15, one of the
genes induced by epigenetic inactivation of SULF2. ISG15 has also been demonstrated to
increase the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to CPT in vitro through affecting the
removal of DNA damage induced by this chemotherapeutic agent (Desai et al., 2008).
Specifically, during DNA replication and gene transcription TOPO1 opens the double helix
by nicking one DNA strand, unwinds, and re-ligates it back (Figure 5E). This process is
more frequent in highly replicating cells such as cancer cells. CPT and its analogues form a

ternary complex (DNA-TOPO1-CPT) that prevents the re-ligation process, and induces
DNA damage leading to cell cycle arrest until the damage is repaired or the cell undergoes
apoptosis. A key step in the repair process is the degradation and removal of the DNA
adducts through the ubiquitin/26S proteasomal pathway that in turn, can render cells
resistant to CPT and its analogues (Desai et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2008). ISG15 blocks the
ubiquitin/26S proteasomal pathway leading to accumulation of CPT induced DNA damage
that results in increased apoptosis (Desai et al., 2006; Desai et al., 2008).

Topoisomerase-I inhibitors, TPT and irinotecan have been used for cancer therapy as a
single agent or in combination with other drugs. TPT is FDA approved as a second-line drug
for the treatment of advanced ovarian, cervical, and small cell lung cancers (McGuire et al.,
2000; Monk et al., 2009; O'Brien et al., 2007). The limited number of clinical trials using
TPT as a single agent for NSCLC have demonstrated response rates (RR) and median OS
ranging from 0 – 25% and 40 – 74 weeks as first-line and 2.8 – 8% and 10 – 34 weeks in
second-line settings, respectively (Gonzalez et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2008). Two recent
phase II and phase III clinical trials, demonstrated that oral TPT in unselected NSCLC
patients is as effective as docetaxel, the FDA approved second-line drug for NSCLC
(Gonzalez et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2008; Ramlau et al., 2006; Weitz et al., 2000). Large
intra-study differences in OS ranging from 4 – 59 and 2 – 46 weeks were also seen when
TPT was used as a first- or second-line therapy for NSCLC patients, respectively (Gonzalez
et al., 2010; White et al., 2000). Thus, it is provocative to hypothesize that the most
responsive NSCLC patients to TPT are those whose tumors have elevated expression of
ISG15. Furthermore, the fact that 25% of primary tumors had elevated expression of ISG15
comparable to levels that led to increased in vitro and in vivo sensitivity to TOPO1 inhibitors
supports extending these findings to a Phase II clinical trial of TPT with patient selection
driven by ISG15 expression.

DNA extraction, modification, and methylation analysis using combined bisulfite
modification and restriction analysis (COBRA), methylation specific PCR (MSP), and
bisulfite sequencing were done as described (Tessema et al., 2008). SULF2 methylation in
HBEC and cancer cell lines was determined using COBRA; positive and negative controls
were selected and used to optimize the MSP assays. SULF2 methylation in primary tumors
was determined using MSP and results were validated for selected samples through COBRA
and bisulfite sequencing. For gene expression assays lung cancer cell lines were treated with
sham (vehicle), TSA (300nM trichostatin A for 18 h), or DAC (500nM 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine for 4 days), harvested and RNA extracted as described (Tessema et al., 2008).
RNA from primary tumor biopsies was isolated using RecoverAll™ Total Nucleic Acid
Isolation Kit for Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded Samples from Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA) following the manufacturers' instruction. RNA was reverse transcribed
using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit from Applied Biosystems. Target
genes were amplified in multiplex with an endogenous control (β‐actin) using primer probe
mixes for quantitative TaqMan assays from Applied Biosystems. Gene expression was
normalized to the housekeeping gene β‐actin and quantified relative to expression in
NHBEC as described (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The effect of sham, TSA, and DAC
treatments on SULF2 expression was also assessed using a gel-based assay as described
(Tessema et al., 2008). Primers and PCR conditions for all methylation and gel-based gene
expression assays are shown in Table S5.
SULF2 knockdown and genome-wide expression

Author Manuscript

Cells were transfected with SULF2 specific s31806 (siSULF2) or negative control #1
(siControl) siRNA (Applied Biosystems) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Santa
Clara, CA). For expression assays, cells were harvested 48h post-transfection, SULF2
knockdown was confirmed by TaqMan, and effects on genome-wide gene expression was
compared between siControl and siSULF2 Calu-3 cells using the Agilent whole genome
transcriptome array as described (Tessema et al., 2010).
Cell survival, migration, and drug sensitivity

Author Manuscript

Cell survival and migration were compared between parental, siControl, and siSULF2
transfected cells using MTT and wound closure assays, respectively as described (Duan et
al., 2004). Briefly, equal size wounds were created 24h post-transfection and pictures of
wound size taken at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96h post-wounding. The distance between the edges
of the wounds were measured at ten regions across the wound for each time point, the
changes in wound size were compared to the measurements taken at time 0h, and the
differences are shown as wound closure (%). For changes in survival and/or proliferation,
equal number of cells were plated, transfected the next day, and the number of live parental,
siControl, and siSULF2 cells were compared at 24, 48, 72, and 96h post-transfection using
MTT. For drug sensitivity, NSCLC cell lines were plated 20,000 cells/well in 24-well plates,
treated the next day or 24 h post-siRNA tansfection with a range of drug concentration; CPT
or TPT (0 – 16.52 μM), cisplatin (0 – 100 μM), carboplatin (0 – 500 μM), or paclitaxel (0 –

conducted in triplicate and the results are shown as mean ± SEM.
Tumor growth in nude mice

Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were approved by the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute
animal study review board and were conducted according to the institute's Animal Care
guidelines. One-to-one mixture of BD Matrigel™ Basement Membrane Matrix (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with H1975 (SULF2M) or A549 (SULF2U) cells was
subcutaneously injected (2.5 × 106 cells/site) into both sides of the dorso-lateral abdomen of
12 female athymic (NCr-nu/nu) nude mice (Frederick, MD). When tumor growth was
visible, mice were grouped into control and treatment groups, and received once-a-week
intra-peritoneal injection of 0.1 ml PBS (control) or 10 mg/kg TPT for 4 weeks. To compare
the efficacy of TPT to cisplatin, another 12 mice with H1975 tumors were similarly treated
weekly with PBS (control), 10 mg/kg TPT, 3 mg/kg cisplatin, or 10 mg/kg TPT followed by
3 mg/kg cisplatin two days later. Tumor size and animal weight were measured twice a
week until the mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks of treatment. Mice in the control groups
were sacrificed earlier due to extensive tumor growth. Tumor volume was calculated as (a ×
b2)/2, a (longer) and b (shorter) tumor dimensions.
Data analysis

Author Manuscript

SULF2 methylation and patient characteristics including age, gender, smoking status, tumor
histology, and performance were summarized with mean and standard deviation for
continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Survival time was calculated
from time of diagnosis until death from any cause or last follow-up. The association between
methylation and patient characteristics was assessed by Fisher's exact test. Kaplan-Meier
plots, the log-rank test, and proportional hazards models were also employed. The effect of
SULF2 methylation (SULF2U vs. SULF2M) and siRNA knockdown (siControl vs.
siSULF2) on gene expression, and the effect of treatment on tumor weight (control, Cis,
TPT, or Cis+TPT) were compared using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey's
and Dunnett's method were used for pair wise and treatment control comparison
adjustments, respectively. The impact of potential outliers on the one way ANOVA values
was controlled using nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank-sum test. The effects of SULF2
knockdown on wound-closure, and drugs on tumor-size over time were compared using a
two-way mixed effect repeated measurement model.

Figure 1. Methylation of SULF2 promoter CpG island silences gene expression

Author Manuscript

(A) COBRA results revealed that SULF2 is unmethylated (not digested by the BstU1
enzyme) in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) (top left) and some lung cancer cell
lines (middle). In contrast, complete methylation of SULF2 (shown by the completely
digested bands) was found in some NSCLC cell lines such as H358, SKLU1, and H1975. In
HBEC and lung cancer cell lines where SULF2 is unmethylated, the gene is readily
expressed in sham treated (S) cells. In contrast, SULF2 expression was completely silenced
in cell lines with methylated promoter and expression could be primarily restored by DAC
(D) treatment. Partial restoration of expression was seen in some cell lines (e.g. H358 and
SKLU1) after TSA treatment indicating epigenetic regulation through both methylation and
histone modification. (B) For selected samples the degree and distribution of methylation at

(A) Calu-3 cells in which SULF2 is unmethylated and expressed at similar level to HBEC
were transfected with control (siControl) or SULF2 specific siRNA (siSULF2). Compared to
siControl transfected cells, SULF2 expression was reduced by 80% in siSULF2 transfected
cells (p < 0.02). (B) Comparison of genome-wide changes in gene expression between
siControl and siSULF2 cells revealed that SULF2 knockdown primarily activated the
immune response, cell proliferation, differentiation, and DNA-damage responses pathways,
log values are at base 10. (C) The mean expression of SULF2 in lung cancer cell lines with
methylated SULF2 (SULF2M) was reduced 845-fold compared to cell lines with
unmethylated SULF2 (SULF2U). In contrast, the mean expression of some INF-inducible
genes was increased 25 – 125-fold in SULF2M cell lines (p < 0.01 each). (D) SULF2M
NSCLC cell lines on average express 60-fold higher ISG15 compared to SULF2U NSCLC
cell lines and HBEC. NSCLC cell lines used for Figures 3C and 3D are: SULF2U (H23,

Figure 5. High ISG15 expressing tumors are sensitive to topotecan in vivo

Once a week 10 mg/kg topotecan (TPT) therapy had (A) no effect (p = 0.58) on the growth
of tumors derived from A549 (SULF2U-ISG15L cell line) but (B) dramatically arrested the
growth of tumors derived from H1975 (SULF2M-ISG15H cell line) in nude mice (p <

xenografts. Once a week 3mg/kg cisplatin (Cis) treatment of nude mice had moderate (p =

0.001) and adding 3 mg/kg Cis two days after each TPT therapy had no additional benefit (p
= 0.85). The average tumor weight in TPT treated mice (0.085g) was 15× smaller than
untreated tumors (1.289g) and 10× smaller than Cis treated tumors (0.872g). (D) ISG15
expression is elevated in a subset of primary NSCLC. Distant normal lung tissue (DNLT)
obtained from NSCLC patients on average express 7.1-fold (2.9 – 15.6) higher ISG15 than
NHBEC (0.37 – 1.64) and showed more variation between samples. Lines indicate median
expression. The variation was much larger (0.5 – 73-fold) among primary tumors. NSCLC
patients can be classified into two distinct groups, ISG15L and ISG15H, based on the level
of ISG15 expression. Tumors from 75% of NSCLC patients express lower levels of ISG15
(ISG15L) that was similar to DNLT (mean 7.7- vs. 7.1-fold and median 7.5- vs. 5.2-fold). In
contrast, tumors from 25% of NSCLC patients express much higher ISG15 (mean 42-fold
and median 36-fold) that was comparable to the TPT sensitive NSCLC cell lines,
representing an ISG15H subpopulation that could benefit from personalized topotecan
therapy. (E) A schematic representation of the mechanism by which SULF2 methylation and
the associated high ISG15 expression could sensitize cancer cells to topoismerase-1
