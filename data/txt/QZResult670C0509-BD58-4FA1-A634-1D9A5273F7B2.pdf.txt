Abstract
The transcription factor PU.1 is essential for myeloid and Bcell development. Down-regulation of PU.1 by disruption of its
14-kb 5¶ upstream regulatory element induced acute myeloid
leukemia, T-cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia–like disease in murine models. In the present study, we
found that PU.1 was down-regulated in the majority of human
myeloma cell lines and a subset of freshly isolated myeloma
cells, in contrast to relatively high expression of PU.1 in
normal plasma cells. Patients in this low PU.1 expression
subset may have a poor prognosis. In human myeloma cell
lines, the 17-kb 5¶ upstream enhancer and the promoter region
of the PU.1 gene were highly methylated, and this is consistent
with disappearance of DNase I–hypersensitive sites in these
regions. To elucidate the significance of down-regulation of
PU.1, we generated stable myeloma cell lines with an inducible
PU.1 expression system. Exogenous expression of PU.1 in PU.1
null myeloma cell lines, U266 and KMS12PE, induced complete
growth arrest and cell death. Up-regulation of PU.1 by 5-aza2¶-deoxycytidine also induced growth arrest of KMS12PE and
KHM11 myeloma cells. These data suggest that downregulation of PU.1 is an essential step for the survival of a
subset of myeloma cells and that up-regulation of PU.1 by
demethylation agents or other types of agents may represent a
new therapeutic strategy for treatment of multiple myeloma
patients. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5328–36]

integration site of PU.1, and found that PU.1 itself can bind to this
element (3, 6). Knocking out this 14-kb 5¶ upstream regulatory
region induced down-regulation of PU.1 to 20% of the wild-type
(WT) level, and all the knockout mice developed acute myeloid
leukemia, T-cell lymphomas, and/or chronic lymphocytic leukemia–like disease (9, 10). These findings suggest that PU.1 may show
tumor suppressor activity against leukemogenesis. In addition, PU.1
is frequently silenced by deletion and point mutations of the PU.1
coding region in a radiation-induced murine leukemia model (11).
In human leukemia, PU.1 was found to be mutated in one allele in
7% of subjects in a Japanese cohort (12). The role of PU.1 in
myelopoiesis has been well elucidated and PU.1 is an essential
transcription factor for myeloid cells. In contrast, in lymphopoiesis,
PU.1 is necessary for commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to
the common lymphoid progenitor stage but is not required for
maturation of B lymphocytes after the common lymphoid
progenitor stage (13–15). It has been reported that PU.1 is expressed
in normal plasma cells (16), but its role in plasma cell development
has not been elucidated. PU.1 is down-regulated in myeloma cell
lines (17), but the functional significance of this down-regulation is
not clear. Here, we report that PU.1 is down-regulated in freshly
isolated myeloma cells from a subset of patients and the majority of
myeloma cell lines and that conditional expression of PU.1 induces
growth arrest and cell death of PU.1 null myeloma cell lines. These
data suggest that PU.1 may have tumor suppressor activity for
plasma cells and that down-regulation of PU.1 is related to the
growth advantage and poor prognosis of myeloma patients.

Introduction
PU.1 is a critical transcription factor for the development of
myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Its expression is tightly regulated
through hematopoiesis and disruption of this tight regulation can
lead to leukemias in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages in
experimental models. PU.1 was originally identified as an oncogene
activated by spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) integration into a
region 14 kb upstream of the PU.1 transcription start site, resulting
in erythroleukemia in mice (1). Proper gene expression in vivo
generally requires combinatorial interactions of cis-elements,
which are often located many kilobases upstream or downstream
of the promoter region (2–8). We identified a 14-kb 5¶ upstream
regulatory region in the murine PU.1 gene, which is also a SFFV

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human myeloma cell lines (KMM1, KHM4, KHM11, U266,
KMS12BM, KMS12PE, and RPMI8226), human myeloid U937 and HL-60
cells, and B lymphocyte KMS1B, KMS2B, and Raji cells and T lymphocyte
Jurkat and CEM cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine
serum at 37jC.
Patients. Myeloma patient samples and non-myeloma plasma cell
samples were obtained from the Hematology Division of Kumamoto
University of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained according
to the Declaration of Helsinki in keeping with institutional policies.
Purification of myeloma cells and normal plasma cells. Myeloma
cells from patient samples and normal plasma cells obtained from bone
marrow samples of malignant lymphoma patients without invasion of
lymphoma cells were purified as CD138-positive cells using anti-CD138
antibody–conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). To obtain highly
purified myeloma cell samples, samples from patients were stained with
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD138 antibody and FITC-conjugated antiCD11b, anti-CD33, and anti-CD19 antibodies or anti-CD5 antibody, and the
myeloma cells and normal plasma cells were sorted as CD138 single–
positive cells using a FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson). Sorting was carried
out thrice and the purities of the cells were >96%.

Down-regulation of PU.1 by Methylation in Myeloma

Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR.
Quantitative Taqman PCR was done with commercially available assay-ondemand probe primer sets for PU.1 and h-actin (Applied Biosystems) and
Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix reagent using an ABI Prism 7700
Sequence Detection System. The expression level of h-actin was used to
standardize the relative expression level of PU.1. The expression level of
PU.1 in PU.1-positive myeloma cell line KMS12BM was set as 100.
Semiquantitative PCR analysis was done with the following primers: 5¶GCCGAGAACAACTTCACGG-3¶ and 5¶-CAGATGCTGTCCTTCATGTCG-3¶
(PU.1) and 5¶-GGAGCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCT-3¶ and 5¶-TCAAAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGTGT-3¶ [glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH)].
Bisulfite sequencing. We treated genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite as
described previously (18) and then subjected the treated DNA to 35 cycles of
PCR. We found CpG islands around the 17-kb 5¶ upstream region and intron
1 of the PU.1 gene using software created by the University of California to
search for CpG islands.4 A 326-bp DNA fragment of the PU.1 17-kb 5¶
upstream region containing the CpG islands was amplified with the primers
5¶-GTTGGATATTTTTTTGAGGTTTGG-3¶ and 5¶-TAAAACCTAAAACTACTAAACCCA-3¶, whereas a 448-bp PU.1 promoter-intron 1 region containing
the CpG islands was amplified with the primers 5¶-GAGATTTTTTGTATGTAGYGTAAGA-3¶ and 5¶-TAACTTCCCACTAATAACAAACCA-3¶. PCR products were directly sequenced and also subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector. Four clones for each myeloma cell line were sequenced for
evaluation of their methylation status.
DNase I–hypersensitive site assay. DNase I–hypersensitive sites (DHS)
were assayed as described previously (19). Probe 1 for the 17-kb 5¶ upstream
region was amplified by PCR with the primers 5¶-GAGGGATCTTCCTGCCATGT-3¶ and 5¶-GTGGTCACCCAGAAAAGGGA-3¶, whereas probe 2 for the
promoter region was amplified by PCR with the primers 5¶-CCACTCTCTGTCCCAGTTCC-3¶ and 5¶-TTAGGAAACCCTGCCAACCA-3¶.
Constructs. pCAG20-1, pUHD-3 puromycin, and pUHD-10-3 IRES-GFP
plasmids were kind gifts from Dr. Takumi Era (Laboratory for Stem Cell
Biology, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe City, Hyogo, Japan;
ref. 20). Human PU.1 cDNA was subcloned into the blunt-ended EcoRI site
of pUHD10-3 IRES-GFP, resulting in pUHD10-3 PU.1-IRES-GFP.
Stable transformants with PU.1 expression. To obtain tetracycline-off
(‘‘tet-off ’’) PU.1-inducible myeloma cell lines, 1  107 U266 or KMS12PE cells
were cotransfected with 10 Ag each of Sca-1–digested pCAG20-1 and a
pUHD-3 puromycin plasmid by electroporation. After puromycin-resistant
stable cell lines, designated U266-puro and KMS12PE-puro, were obtained,
U266-puro cells were transfected with 10 Ag Sca-1–digested pUHD10-3 PU.1IRES-GFP and 1 Ag HindIII-digested pPGKneo, whereas KMS12PE-puro cells
were transfected with 10 Ag Sca-1–digested pUHD10-3 PU.1-IRES-GFP and
1 Ag Sca-1–digested pZeoSV2+. After isolation of G418- or zeocin-resistant
clones, tetracycline was removed and the cells were analyzed for their green
fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis.
Electron microscopy. Cell pellets of U266tetPU.1 cells were fixed with 1.0%
glutaraldehyde for 60 min and postfixed with 1.0% osmium tetroxide for
30 min at 4jC. After dehydration in a graded ethanol series, the cells were
embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate were observed using an H-7500 electron microscope (Hitachi).
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated
with anti-PU.1, anti-p27, anti-L-MYC, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-A1/Bfl-1,
anti-caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin E
(BD PharMingen), or anti-h-actin (Sigma Chemical Co.) primary antibodies
for 1 h. Finally the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled
secondary antibodies for 1 h and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were stained with 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide
and treated with 10 Ag/mL RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. Cell
cycle analyses were done using a flow cytometer (EPICS V, Coulter).

Detection of apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantified using an Annexin VPhycoerythrin Apoptosis Detection kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories).
5-Aza-2¶-deoxycytidine treatment. KMS12PE, KHM11, and RPMI8226
cells were treated with 250 or 500 nmol/L 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine. Total RNA
was extracted from the 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine–treated cells and subjected
to 30 cycles of RT-PCR for PU.1 and 25 cycles for GAPDH.

Results
PU.1 is down-regulated in myeloma patients and myeloma
cell lines. Using real-time PCR, we found that PU.1 was completely
down-regulated in five of seven myeloma lines (U266, KMS12PE,
KHM4, KHM11, and KMM1), whereas the other two cell lines
(KMS12BM and RPMI8226) contained similar levels of PU.1 mRNA
to those observed in B-cell lines (Fig. 1A). Next, we evaluated
whether PU.1 expression was also down-regulated in freshly
isolated primary myeloma cells. To purify myeloma cells, we used
an anti-CD138 antibody and magnetic bead isolation technique
(Miltenyi Biotec). Compared with the relatively high levels of PU.1
expression in normal plasma cells, PU.1 was down-regulated to
various levels in several myeloma patients (Fig. 1B). Although the
myeloma cells purified with the anti-CD138 antibody and magnetic
beads had purities of 90% to 95%, they nevertheless included
contaminating granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and B cells,
all of which express PU.1 at relatively high levels. Therefore, the
patients with low PU.1 expression in Fig. 1C may have almost
complete loss of PU.1 expression. To improve the purity of the
primary myeloma cells, we did FACS of CD138-positive myeloma
cells from patients and subjected these more highly purified
populations to RT-PCR for PU.1. We also purified normal plasma
cells, sorted as CD138-positive cells, from bone marrow samples
from malignant lymphoma patients lacking invasion of lymphoma
cells. The purities of the sorted myeloma cells and normal plasma
cells were >95% (Fig. 1C). We did not detect any PU.1 expression
after 35 cycles of PCR in purified myeloma cells from one myeloma
patient, suggesting that at least some of the patients with low
PU.1 expression do not have detectable PU.1 expression in their
myeloma cells, similar to the majority of myeloma cell lines
(Fig. 1C). In contrast, we detected relatively high expression levels
of PU.1 in FACS-purified normal plasma cell samples. These data
indicate that PU.1 is not down-regulated in normal plasma cells but
is completely down-regulated in several myeloma patients.
Two patients exhibited very high relative levels of PU.1 RNA in
their myeloma cells (patients 1 and 2). Because the expression level
of PU.1 was standardized to that of h-actin, it is possible that these
high PU.1 expression levels might be artificially elevated as a result
of low levels of h-actin. Indeed, we did not observe such high
expression levels of PU.1 RNA in these patient samples using
semiquantitative PCR (data not shown).
Low PU.1 expression may identify a subset of myeloma
patients a poor prognosis. Based on their PU.1 expression levels,
we provisionally divided the myeloma patients into two groups (i.e.,
PU.1 high and PU.1 low-to-negative) using a cutoff index of 25
(approximately corresponding to the lower 25th percentile of the
PU.1 expression level distribution among all patients; PU.1 high
was patient 21 and up and low-to-negative was patients 22–29) and
evaluated the clinical features of the two subsets. There were no
differences for the immunoglobulin subtypes, ages, or gender that
were associated with PU.1 expression levels. In contrast, median
survival was 5.6 months for PU.1 low-to-negative patients (n = 8)
and 27.0 months for the PU.1 high patients (n = 21; P < 0.05).

However, the number of patients analyzed was small (n = 29);
therefore, additional follow-up studies will be required to conclude
that loss of PU.1 expression is a prognostic factor in myeloma.
These data suggest that down-regulated PU.1 expression might be
related to an aggressive phenotype of myeloma or refractoriness to
chemotherapeutic agents, including thalidomide and stem cell
transplantation.

Methylation of 17-kb 5¶ upstream cis-elements and the
region from the PU.1 promoter to intron 1 of the PU.1 gene in
myeloma cell lines. PU.1 was reported to be down-regulated
through methylation of intron 1 in T-cell lines (21). Therefore, we
investigated whether the methylation status of the PU.1 gene could
induce down-regulation of PU.1 gene expression. As mentioned
earlier, we reported previously that a 14-kb 5¶ upstream regulatory

done using cDNAs from each cell line and patient sample. The PU.1 expression levels were normalized to the h-actin expression level. C, PU.1 expression in sorted
myeloma cells or normal plasma cells was analyzed by 30 cycles of RT-PCR. CD138 single–positive cells were sorted thrice as purified myeloma cells or normal
plasma cells. Compared with the relatively high expression of PU.1 in purified normal plasma cells, PU.1 is completely down-regulated in purified myeloma cells from
one patient and relatively low in those from the other patient (top left, top right , and bottom left).

cis-element, working in concert with the promoter, is critical for
proper expression of the murine PU.1 gene (6). Hence, we analyzed
the 17-kb 5¶ upstream conserved region of the human PU.1 gene,
which is homologous to the 14-kb 5¶ upstream regulatory elements
of the mouse PU.1 gene. We identified a PU.1-binding site in this
region that was critical for PU.1 gene expression (6). We searched
for CpG islands around the 17-kb 5¶ upstream conserved region and
the promoter region and found CpG islands in the 17-kb 5¶
upstream conserved region itself and intron 1. We did bisulfite
treatment of the genomic DNA and subsequently sequenced these
regions. In three of four PU.1-negative myeloma cell lines (KMM1,
KHM11, and KMS12PE), the 17-kb upstream region was highly
methylated (Fig. 2A and B), whereas RPMI8826, a PU.1-positive

www.aacrjournals.org

myeloma cell line, did not show methylation in this region. In
contrast, the region from promoter to intron 1 was methylated
in all myeloma cell lines examined (Fig. 2C and D). Therefore, the
level of PU.1 expression may be highly dependent on the
methylation status of the 17-kb 5¶ upstream conserved region in
myeloma cells.
We further evaluated the chromatin structure in myeloma cell
lines using a DHS assay. We first evaluated the 17-kb 5¶ upstream
regulatory element using a probe detecting a 6.6-kb EcoRI fragment
(Fig. 3A). In both the PU.1-positive myeloma cell line, RPMI8226, and
the PU.1-positive myelomonocytic cell line, U937, we detected two
additional bands (f4.1 and 2.5 kb in size) following DNase I treatment. These results show the presence of one DHS in the 17-kb

5¶ upstream regulatory region and the located f15.5 kb upstream
of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3A and B). We also evaluated
the region from the PU.1 promoter to intron 1 with a probe
detecting a 6.7-kb XmaI fragment (Fig. 3A). Both RPMI8226 and
U927 cells showed an additional two bands (f3.5 and 1.8 kb in
size), indicating the presence of DHS in the PU.1 promoter and
intron 1 (Fig. 3A and C). These data suggest that PU.1-positive
RPMI8226 and U937 cells have an open chromatin structure in
these regions, which is correlated with transcriptional activation.
In contrast, there were no DHS in these regions in a PU.1-negative
myeloma cell line, KMS12PE (Fig. 3B and C). Therefore, the
methylation status in these regions highly correlated with the
tightly closed chromatin context observed in PU.1-negative
KMS12PE cells.
Conditional expression of PU.1 in a PU.1-negative myeloma
cell line induces cell growth arrest and cell death. We next
examined whether this down-regulation of PU.1 was related to

oncogenesis or growth advantage of myeloma cells. To achieve this,
we generated a stable cell line, designated U266tetPU.1, with a ‘‘tet-off ’’
inducible PU.1 expression system from the PU.1-negative cell line
U266 (20). When PU.1 was expressed after removal of tetracycline,
U266tetPU.1 cells underwent complete cell growth arrest (Fig. 4A).
Morphologically, some of these cells also underwent cell death,
whereas others showed an enlarged cytosol and vacuoles around the
nucleus (Fig. 4B). Electron microscopy observation revealed
liquefaction and degeneration of mitochondria with vacuolization
(Fig. 4C, top left, arrows). Some of these cells had large vacuoles,
which possibly developed due to the liquefaction and degeneration
of mitochondria (Fig. 4C, top right). There were also apoptotic cells
with large complex vacuoles, which appeared to resemble the dilated
endoplasmic reticulum that was abundant in myeloma cells (Fig. 4C,
bottom left). Degeneration of mitochondria may induce leakage of
cytochrome c into the cytosol, provoking activation of the apoptotic
cascade. Some cells also contained autophagosomes (Fig. 4C, bottom

by PU.1, as indicated by an autophagosome in the cytosol (bottom right; arrowheads ). D, growth arrest of U266tetPU.1 cells is reversed by suppression of PU.1
expression. After a 7-d culture without tetracycline, U266tetPU.1 cells begin to grow again following PU.1 suppression after the addition of tetracycline (n) compared with
control cultures, in which PU.1 is expressed in the absence of tetracycline (o). Right, morphologies of U266tetPU.1 cells. Morphologic changes are reversible after

right), suggesting autophagic cell death (22–25). Taken together,
these data indicate that the inducible expression of PU.1 mediates
growth arrest and apoptosis through degradation of mitochondria
and/or the autophagic cell death pathway. In contrast, when PU.1
expression was completely suppressed again by tetracycline addition
at 7 days after its original removal, the cells began growing with a
normal morphology, indicating that the cell growth arrest and
morphologic changes of U266tetPU.1 cells induced by PU.1 were
reversible phenomena (Fig. 4D). We isolated three independent
U266tetPU.1 cell lines, and all three clones showed the same
phenotype after PU.1 expression.
We also generated another stable cell line, designated
KMS12PEtetPU.1, with the same ‘‘tet-off ’’ inducible PU.1 expression
system from the PU.1-negative cell line KMS12PE. Expression of
PU.1 also induced complete growth arrest of all four independent
KMS12PEtetPU.1 clones (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Morphologically,
these cells also contained vacuoles in their cytosol, similar to the
case for U266tetPU.1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Therefore, we
conclude that PU.1 down-regulation is essential for the growth and
survival of two independent human myeloma cell lines.
Next, we evaluated which stage in the cell cycle of U266tetPU.1
cells is affected by the induction of PU.1 expression. M phase cells
were decreased from 19.2% to 8.4% after the induction of PU.1

www.aacrjournals.org

expression, indicating that the cells underwent G1 arrest (Fig. 5A).
There was also an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the
sub-G1 phase from 9.5% to 29.0%. The induction of apoptosis of
U266tetPU.1 cells by PU.1 was confirmed by the increased number
of Annexin V–positive cells from 5.3% to 23.0% (Fig. 5B).
KMS12PEtetPU.1 cells also underwent G1 arrest and apoptosis after
PU.1 induction (data not shown). We further evaluated the levels of
cell cycle– and apoptosis-related proteins before and after PU.1
induction in U266tetPU.1 cells. Among cell cycle–related genes, cyclin
D1 and L-myc, which is activated by translocations to IgH loci in
U266 cells (26), were down-regulated to f50% of the original levels
after PU.1 induction (Fig. 5C, right). In contrast, among apoptosisrelated genes, A1 and Bcl-xL were down-regulated to <50% of the
original levels, and cleavage of caspase-3 was increased after PU.1
induction (Fig. 5C). The decreased protein expression of cell cycle–
related and antiapoptotic genes are relevant to the arrest in cell
growth and apoptosis of U266tetPU.1 cells following induction of
PU.1 expression, albeit these expression changes could represent
indirect effects of PU.1 expression in U266tetPU.1 cells.
Up-regulation of PU.1 in myeloma cell lines by 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine also induces growth arrest and apoptosis of
myeloma cells. Because PU.1 was down-regulated by methylation in
myeloma cell lines and up-regulation of PU.1 induced growth arrest

and apoptosis of myeloma cells, we next investigated whether a
demethylation agent, 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine, could induce the same
effects in myeloma cells through PU.1 induction. Treatment of
KMS12PE and KHM11 myeloma cells, which were PU.1 negative and
had a heavy methylation status of the 17-kb 5¶ upstream regulatory
element and the region from the PU.1 promoter to intron 1, with
5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine induced PU.1 expression and growth suppression (Fig. 6A and B). These data indicate that induction of PU.1
by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine may also induce cell growth arrest and
apoptosis of myeloma cells, although it remains possible that some
other genes induced by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine may mainly induce
these effects. Nevertheless, these data suggest that more powerful
inducers of PU.1, including demethylation agents, should be effective
tools for treating myeloma patients.

Discussion
Our present results show the importance of loss of PU.1
expression for the maintenance of myeloma cell growth and
survival. Specifically, we found that (a) in a subset of myeloma
patients, PU.1 is down-regulated as in the majority of myeloma cell
lines, and PU.1 low-to-negative patients may have a poorer
prognosis than PU.1 high patients; (b) PU.1 is down-regulated
through methylation of the 17-kb 5¶ enhancer region and the
promoter; and (c) exogenous introduction of PU.1 expression or
induction of PU.1 by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine treatment in the PU.1negative cell lines U266, KMS12PE, and KHM11 induces growth
arrest and apoptotic cell death. Therefore, we hypothesize that
there is a subset of myeloma patients with low to negative levels of
PU.1 expression. Furthermore, we propose that down-regulation of

Down-regulation of PU.1 by Methylation in Myeloma

Figure 6. Cell growth arrest of KMS12PE and KHM11 myeloma cells is induced by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC ) treatment through up-regulation of PU.1.
A, PU.1 expression is restored by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine treatment. RT-PCR was done for 30 cycles for PU.1 and 25 cycles for GAPDH using almost equal amounts
of cDNA. B, restoration of PU.1 expression by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine induces growth arrest of KMS12PE and KHM11 myeloma cells. Induction of PU.1 (o; with
500 nmol/L 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine) induces growth arrest of KMS12PE and KHM11 cells compared with their exponential growth without 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (.).

PU.1 through methylation represents an important genetic event
for oncogenesis and/or growth advantage of myeloma cells. To
understand the meaning of the down-regulation of PU.1 expression
in myeloma cells, we need to know the function of PU.1 in normal
plasma cells. We reported previously that PU.1 has a tumor
suppressor activity for leukemogenesis because knockout of the
14-kb 5¶ regulatory elements of the mouse PU.1 gene leads to downregulation of PU.1 to 20% of the WT level and subsequent leukemia
in mice (9). Recently, it is reported that conditional knockout of
PU.1 in early B-cell precursors does not affect their further maturation (13). Nevertheless, the function of PU.1 during the late stage
of B-cell lymphopoiesis, including the plasma cell stage, is unclear.
Our present data suggest that PU.1 may be necessary for the
growth arrest and apoptotic pathways that prevent uncontrolled
growth of plasma cells and that disruption of these pathways
may lead to multiple myeloma. We are currently investigating the
mechanisms that evoke the growth arrest and cell death of myeloma cell lines after PU.1 induction. We are also trying to generate
mice with conditional knockout of PU.1 only in plasma cells.
Proper gene expression in vivo generally requires not only the
promoter region but also cis-elements in introns and/or distal 5¶
regions and/or 3¶ regions. Nevertheless, it is usually the case that
methylation studies are only done for CpG islands in promoter
regions to explain the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or genes
related to growth arrest or apoptosis. In myeloma cells, the
promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, including p15, p16,
SHP-1, and SOCS1, are highly methylated (27–33). In the present
study, we detected methylation of CpG islands within the 17-kb 5¶
upstream highly conserved region in addition to the promoter. This
is the first report to show that methylation of such distal ciselements critical for gene expression may contribute to tumor
formation in humans.
Recently, a study involving fluorescence in situ hybridization
identified translocations of the IgH locus, including t(4;14), t(6;14),
t(11;14), t(14;16), and t(14;20), in monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS), myeloma patients, and mye-

loma cell lines that directly dysregulate FGFR3 and MMSET, cyclin
D3 and IRF4, cyclin D1, c-MAF, and MAFB, respectively (34–39).
The prevalences of the IgH translocations increase according to the
myeloma disease stages (50% in MGUS, 55–73% in multiple
myeloma, and 90% in myeloma cell lines), and some of them are
closely related to a poor prognosis (40). We did not recognize PU.1
down-regulation in MGUS patients (data not shown), whereas PU.1
was down-regulated in myeloma cell lines, specifically KHM11 with
t(4;14), KMM1 with t(6;14), and U266 and KMS12PE with t(11;14).
These data suggest that PU.1 down-regulation may not be an early
genetic event for oncogenesis of myeloma, but rather a genetic
alteration dependent on disease progression and a poor prognosis,
although it remains possible that down-regulation of PU.1 may be
an initial event leading to oncogenesis in some cases of myeloma.
Our present results have shown that expression of PU.1 in PU.1negative myeloma cells can induce growth arrest and cell death of
these cells, suggesting that reintroduction of PU.1 may represent a
novel molecularly targeted therapeutic strategy for myeloma
patients. We have further shown that demethylation agents, such
as 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine, can restore PU.1 expression and suppress
the growth of some myeloma cells, although 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine
should activate many other genes that may also induce cell growth
arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, more effective derivatives or other
type of agents that specifically increase PU.1 expression levels may
represent new therapeutic agents for aggressive myeloma.
