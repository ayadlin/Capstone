ABSTRACT
Myc (c-Myc) counteracts p27 effects, and low p27 usually correlates with high Myc
expression in human cancer. However there is no information on the co-expression
of both genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We found a lack of correlation
between RNA and protein levels of p27 and Myc in CLL cells, so we determined the
protein levels by immunoblot in 107 cases of CLL. We observed a high p27 protein
expression in CLL compared to normal B cells. Ectopic p27 expression in a CLL-derived
cell line resulted in cell death resistance. Surprisingly, Myc expression was very low
or undetectable in most CLL cases analyzed, with a clear correlation between high
p27 and low Myc protein levels. This was associated with low Skp2 expression, which
is consistent with the Skp2 role in p27 degradation and with SKP2 being a Myc target
gene. High Myc expression did not correlate with leukemia progression, despite
that cell cycle-related Myc target genes were upregulated. However, biochemical
analysis showed that the high p27 levels inhibited cyclin-Cdk complexes even in Myc
expressing CLL cells. Our data suggest that the combination of high p27 and low Myc
is a marker of CLL cells which is mediated by Skp2.

disease. Patients with no mutation in the variable region of
the immunoglobulin genes (IGH) or with high expression
of CD38 or ZAP70 had an aggressive course, whereas
patients with mutated IGH clones or low expression
of CD38 or ZAP70 cells usually show an indolent
course [1, 3].
It has been reported alterations of cell cycle
regulatory molecules in CLL, such as cyclin E, cyclin D,
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and Cdk2 [4, 5]. The
Cdk inhibitor p27KIP1 (p27), that negatively controls
cell-cycle progression, has been observed overexpressed
in CLL cells [6-8]. This is in contrast to the majority
of human tumors, where low levels of p27 are found
[9-11]. p27 down-regulation in cancer has been associated
with its function as an inhibitor of cell cycle. Indeed, a
marked reduction in the abundance of p27 is common in
many human tumors. In most cases where p27 regulation
is described, the levels of p27 are mainly regulated at
posttranslational level. This is mostly carried out by the
SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase complex, where Skp2 acts as the
p27-recogninzing subunit [12-14].
c-Myc (Myc herein after) is an oncogenic
transcription factor or the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper
protein family. Myc forms dimers with the protein Max.
These heterodimers bind to specific sequences called
E-boxes in regulatory regions of target genes as well
as intergenic regions. Myc-Max dimers bind to 15% of
genomic loci and regulate about 1000 genes [15, 16].
Myc function integrating multiple signals, mediating
transcriptional response that impinges on a wide array
of biological functions such as cell cycle control,
genomic instability, energetic metabolism, protein
synthesis, intercellular communication and control of cell
differentiation [17-22]. Consistent with these functions,
high levels of this protein has been found in many
human tumors [18, 23], and prominently in leukemia and
lymphoma [24, 25].
In CLL, contradictory results on Myc mRNA levels
in peripheral blood cells have been published. Some
studies reported low Myc mRNA levels whereas high
expression levels have been described in other [26-28].
MYC amplification and chromosomal rearrangements
are very rare in CLL (less than 3%) but gains at
8q23.3-q24.3 (where MYC maps) was identified as a poor
prognostic marker [29]. The frequency of MYC mutation,
amplification and translocation increase in a subset of CLL
with aggressive disease (30% of the cases) [30, 31] and in
the CLL transformation to high grade lymphoma known
as Richter syndrome [30, 32-34].
In cellular models, Myc blocks p27 antiproliferative
activity and in most tumors there is an inverse correlation
between Myc and p27 levels. Myc abrogates p27 function
in proliferation arrest. This antagonism occurs through
at least three levels. First, Myc represses p27 gene
(CDKN1B) expression [35, 36]. Second, Myc induces
cyclins and CDKs which can sequester p27 in CDKwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cyclin complexes [37-40]. Third, Myc induces the
transcription of Skp2 [41]. The F-box protein Skp2 is the
p27-recognizing subunit and the major responsible for p27
ubiquitination and degradation [42-44].
Despite their functional interactions, it is unknown
whether Myc and p27 are coexpressed in CLL and whether
Myc can compensate the reported high p27 expression.
Here we studied the regulation of p27 and Myc in tumoral
peripheral CLL cells and their correlation with the clinical
features of the leukemia. In a cohort of more than 100
patients we analysed protein and mRNA expression of
p27 and Myc. We found that p27 and Myc levels were
inversely correlated, being p27 overexpressed and Myc
downregulated. This correlation appears inverted in CLL
with respect to conversely to most tumors. The excess
in p27 counteracts Myc effect on cell cycle in the small
number of samples with high Myc expression. We also
found that low p27 and high Myc expression correlated
with Skp2 suggesting a mechanistic explanation for
Myc and p27 inverse correlation in CLL. Moreover, the
enforced expression of p27 in a CLL-derived cell line
resulted in resistance to apoptosis.

RESULTS
High p27 protein expression in CLL
We first studied the mRNA levels of p27 in a cohort
of 67 CLL patients by RT-qPCR or Northern blot analysis
(Supplementary Table S1). The results revealed an increase
(~5 fold as a mean) in p27 mRNA in CLL samples, as
compared to controls (tonsil and peripheral blood B
lymphocytes) (Figure 1A) The analysis of the mRNA data
loaded in the Oncomine databank (www.oncomine.org)
revealed a high heterogeneity among different studies. In
some studies CLL samples showed higher levels of p27
mRNA with respect to controls, whereas these differences
were not observed in other studies. Supplementary
Figure S1 show two discordant studies. As previous
results from our lab and others demonstrated an intense
post-transcriptional regulation of p27 in human leukemia
cells [45], we compared p27 mRNA (by RT-qPCR) and
p27 protein (by immunoblot) levels in a subset of CLL
cases. We confirmed the lack of correlation between
both mRNA and protein levels in some samples (Figure
1B). In view of this result we decided to analyse p27 at
the protein level in peripheral blood cells from 107 CLL
cases by immunoblot. p27 signals were quantified by
densitometry analysis and normalized against actin levels
of each sample. The results showed that p27 protein is
clearly overexpressed in CLL cells compared to normal
B cells (86% of samples) (Figure 1C). A representative
immunoblot showing p27 protein expression is shown
in the Figure 1D. CLL cells showed a mean of 3-fold
higher levels of p27 than controls. Only a minority of
CLL samples showed levels of p27 protein similar to those

observed in healthy control B cells. The high p27 levels in
CLL cells is a striking finding because of the well-known
role of p27 as inhibitor of the cell cycle progression. It
is also in contrast to the situation in the rest of human
tumors, where p27 is down-regulated, However, high
p27 levels have been described in some tumors (breast,
colon, melanoma, ovary, thyroid and lymphomas) where
an aberrant cytoplasmic expression of p27 was observed
[46-48]. Thus we explored the possibility of a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p27 cytoplasmic localization in CLL cells. The
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that p27 localization
was mainly nuclear in the 9 fresh CLL samples analyzed.
Some representative cases are shown in Figure 1E.
We next asked for a possible correlation of p27
protein expression and some CLL prognostic markers.
We found that low p27 was associated to high ZAP70
expression and absence of 13q14 deletion (Supplementary
Figure S2). No significant correlation was found in the

others markers tested (expression of CD38, p53 deletion
and ATM deletion), Furthermore we did not detect in our
cohort of CLL patients a significant association of high
p27 with Rai staging (P = 0.88, n = 85), progression of the
leukemia (P = 0.69, n = 86) and with overall survival (P =
0.4, n = 86) (not shown).

Figure S3). Our analysis revealed a poor correlation
between Myc mRNA and protein levels (P = 0.39, n = 31)
(Figure 2B). We analyzed Myc protein levels in 102
CLL samples by immunoblot and the Myc protein levels
were quantified by densitometry and normalized against
the actin levels. Most of patients showed undetectable
or low levels of Myc protein, as compared to controls
(Figure 2C, D). Only 18.6% of our samples (19 samples)
showed a Myc expression higher than in control samples.
It is noteworthy that only five patients (5% of cases)
showed Myc levels ≥2-fold above control level. This low
number of Myc-positive specimens makes it difficult to
generate statistically significant data. However, we did not
found any correlation between Myc expression and any
of the bad prognosis markers analyzed (CD38 or ZAP70
expression, trisomy 12, ATM deletion, p53 deletion and
13q14 deletion). We also failed to detect a close correlation
between high Myc protein levels and NOTCH mutation

Low Myc protein expression in CLL
In view of the involvement of Myc in B-cell
malignancies and the Myc-p27 functional antagonism
described in most models, we set out to examine Myc
expression in our CLL cases (Supplementary Table S1).
Myc mRNA levels were clearly down-regulated in CLL
samples (n = 83) with respect to controls (Figure 2A).
The Myc mRNA data loaded in the Oncomine databank
(www.oncomine.org) revealed also contradictory results
(two discordant studies are shown in Supplemental

or overexpression (not shown). We did not detect a
significant difference in the overall survival between Myc
protein overexpressors and the rest of patients (P = 0.10,
n = 82). Moreover we did not detect a significant impact
of Myc protein levels on the progression of the disease
(P = 0.15, n = 83). The main clinical characteristics of the
patients with high Myc expression are summarized in the
Supplementary Table S2.
We next studied the expression of Myc and p27 in
the same samples to explore the correlation between the
Myc and p27 levels in CLL cells in a cohort of 102 CLL
cases. Immunoblot studies revealed an inverse pattern
of expression between p27 and Myc (Figure 3A shows
a representative blot). The majority of the samples with
low p27 expression showed high Myc levels (Figure 3B).
The densitometric analysis of MYC signals in the blots
revealed that most of the patients with low Myc expression
(96%) showed high p27 expression (Figure 3B). Although
it there was not a linear correlation between the levels
of the two proteins, the Spearman’s coefficient showed
that Myc and p27 levels showed an inverse correlation
(Spearman’s Rho = – 0.2047, P = 0.03, not shown).
Lymph nodes from CLL patients (n = 124) were
also analyzed for the expression of p27 and Myc by
immunohistochemistry. A marked nuclear p27 signal

was observed in the non-proliferative center area of the
node in all cases (representative micrographs are shown
in Supplementary Figure S4). Myc was only expressed
in the proliferative centers in a subset of nodes. Only
16% of the nodes showed expression of Myc in the 10%
or more of the cells. Similarly to peripheral blood cells,
there was no correlation between high Myc expression
and Rai stage or disease progression (i.e., requiring
treatment).

p27 induces Myc downregulation and protects
from apoptosis in CLL-derived cells
To further investigate the mechanisms that could
explain the striking expression pattern of Myc and p27 in
CLL and their functional effects, we over-expressed p27
in the MEC1 cell line, a cell line derived from CLL cells.
A p27 expression vector was transiently transfected into
MEC1 cells, resulting in a dramatic increase in p27 levels
with respect to empty vector-transfected cells (Figure 4A).
Unlike peripheral blood CLL cells, proliferating MEC1
cells expressed high levels of Myc, but Myc expression
was blunted by the over-expression of p27 (Figure 4A).
We next tested the cell cycle profile of these p27transfected cells to assess their functionality. As expected,

p27-transfected cells were arrested in G0/G1 (Figure 4B).
These results are consistent with the observations in
vivo, where the majority of peripheral blood CLL cells
are arrested in G0/G1, and high levels of p27 and low
levels of Myc were observed. The gradual accumulation
of immunologically dysfunctional B lymphocytes (most of
them in G0 phase of the cell cycle) observed in CLL has
been ascribed to defective apoptosis [49-51]. Therefore
we explored whether p27 over-expression may also play a
role in the resistance to apoptosis, a typical characteristic
of CLL cells. For this purpose we generated a p27-YFP
construct and transfected it into MEC1. As apoptotic
stimulus we chose fludarabine, a drug commonly used
in CLL treatment [52, 53] and which induces a decrease
in p27 expression in CLL-derived cells in culture [5].
Apoptosis was determined after treatment of MEC1
cells transfected with the p27 expression vector with
fludarabine. MEC1 cells with high p27 levels were more

resistant to fludarabine-induced cell death than control
cells as assessed by cell viability analysis using trypan
blue (Figure 4C). We also measured the apoptosis in
MEC1 p27-expressing cells by annexin V-binding by flow
cytometry. The results showed that p27-expressing cells
were more resistant to apoptosis (Figure 4D). The same
result was observed by analyzing the expression of active
caspase 3 (Figure 4E). Altogether these results show that
p27 confers apoptosis resistance in MEC1 cells suggesting
that the high p27 levels in CLL cells may contribute to
the accumulation of leukemic cells. Overexpression of the
anti-apoptotic protein Blc2 is a hallmark of CLL [54, 55]
and therefore it may be expected a correlation between
the p27 and Bcl2 levels in the CLL. We analyzed by
immunoblot the expression of Bcl2 in our cohort of CLL
samples and we found a direct correlation between Bcl2
and p27, showing that samples with low p27 expression
also have low Bcl2 protein levels (Figure 4F).

of p27-Cdk-Cyclin complexes and thus the inhibition of
Cdk2. To confirm the presence of these complexes we
performed immunoprecipitations with anti-Cdk2 antibody
and the results showed that p27 was bound to Cdk in
Myc-expressing CLL cells (Figure 5E, upper panel). The
previous results strongly suggested that p27 was inhibiting
Cdk2 in CLL cells. To support this hypothesis, we directly
determined Cdk2 activity in CLL lysates expressing both
Myc and p27, as well as the ability of these lysates to
inhibit Cdk2. First, we immunoprecipitated Cdk2 and its
kinase activity was assayed by determining the level of
phosphorylation at threonine 187 of recombinant inactive
p27. The results show that the p27 present in the CLL cells
was able to inhibit the endogenous Cdk activity, regardless
the expression level of Myc (Figure 5E, lower panel). In
a second approach we asked whether the p27 present in
the CLL cells was able to inhibit exogenous Cdk2, using
MEC1 extracts as the source of active Cdk2. This was
performed in two ways. First we showed that lysates from
p27-expressing CLL cells inhibited the Cdk2 purified
by immunoprecipitation from MEC1 cells (Figure 5F).
Second, we mixed lysates from MEC1 and two CLLs
(with p27), and we showed that the immunoprecipitated
Cdk2 from this mixtures was inactive, whereas the Cdk2
from MEC1 lysates was active (Figure 5G). This result is
in line with the proposal that p27 overrides the effects of
Myc as cell cycle stimulator, and are in line with the lack
of a clear correlation between high Myc expression and
progression of the leukemia. We conclude that, although
Myc induces S-phase cyclins in CLL cells where it is
expressed, the high p27 levels bind to most cyclin-Cdk
complexes formed. Thus, the results suggest that the p27
present in the Myc-expressing cells would impair cell
cycle progression.

Given the role of Myc as an oncoprotein, the
low Myc expression in most CLL cells was intriguing.
We explored the possibility that perhaps Myc was not
functional in these CLL cells. As Myc function as a
heterodimer with the protein Max, we first asked for
the expression of Max in our CLL samples. We showed
that Max mRNA and protein were present in all samples
analyzed (n = 78 and 26, respectively) and, interestingly,
Max mRNA (Supplementary Figure S5A) and Max
protein expression was higher in CLL than in controls
(Supplementary Figure S5B). We next asked for the
functionality of Myc in CLL cells expressing Myc. We
first analyzed the expression of cyclins A and E, which
are cell cycle regulators known to be induced by Myc
[17, 18]. We selected three CLL cases with high and six
with low Myc levels and the results clearly showed that
in the cells with high Myc levels, protein expression of
cyclin A and E were also higher (Figure 5A). Indeed, there
was a clear correlation between Myc and cyclin A levels
(Figure 5B).These results suggested that Myc is functional
in CLL cells. Thus we next asked whether in CLL cells
expressing both p27 and Myc, p27 was also functional,
and can bind to and inhibit Cdk-cyclin complexes. Two
approaches were used. First, the total lysate of B cells
from two CLL cases expressing p27, one with high Myc
levels and the other with low Myc levels (Figure 5C) were
chromatographed through a gel filtration column on a
FPLC apparatus. The results showed that in the presence of
Myc there was a displacement of p27 from free forms into
high-molecular weight fractions containing cyclins and
Cdks complexes (Figure 5D), suggesting the formation

We were intrigued by the inverse correlation
between Myc and p27 in CLL, which follows the
opposite pattern than in most tumors. Samples with
high levels of Myc (11%) (Figure 3B) show lower p27
levels, suggesting a mechanistic connection between the
expression of both proteins. To explore this mechanism
found in CLL we studied Skp2 expression. Skp2 is
the main protein involved in p27 degradation and we
previously reported that SKP2 is a Myc-target gene [41].
Thus, we determined Skp2 protein expression, along with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p27 and Myc, in our CLL cohort. The immunoblot results
showed that high Skp2 levels correlated with high Myc
and low p27 in almost all analyzed cases (a representative
blot is shown in Figure 6A). In the samples with low
Skp2 expression the mean levels of p27 protein were
significantly higher (Figure 6B) whereas the mean levels
of Myc protein were significantly higher in samples with
high Skp2 (Figure 6C). The results argue for a pathway­
Myc-Skp2-p27 to explain the inverse correlation of Myc
and p27 in CLL.

DISCUSSION

progression? It is accepted that inherent defects in
cell death of CLL lymphocytes are responsible for the
accumulation of leukemic cells, the majority of them are
arrested in G0 phase of the cell cycle [3, 49]. G0 arrest
is consistent with the Cdk inhibition brought about by
p27, particularly Cdk2. We hypothesize that p27 could
contribute to the resistance to cell death of CLL cells,
either as a consequence of the cell cycle arrest or through
other less defined mechanisms. To explore this hypothesis
we generated and transfected p27 expression vectors
into the CLL-derived MEC1 cells, and we found that
p27 overexpression resulted in resistance to apoptosis.
The correlation beween high p27 and low apoptosis was
also consistent by the correlation between p27 and Bcl2
expression that we found in CLL patients.
Myc is upregulated in leukemia and lymphoma
[25] and Myc counteracts the p27-mediated inhibition of
proliferation in many models. However, the correlation
between Myc and p27 in CLL cells has never been
analyzed. Previous studies have reported controversial
data so as Myc mRNA expression in peripheral blood
CLL cells [26-28, 59-61]. However, Myc protein stability
is also under intense postransductional regulation [62-64]
and, as in the case of p27, mRNA-base studies can offer
misleading information so as the levels of Myc protein in

It has been reported that expression of p27 has
both prognostic and therapeutic implications in several
tumors [9-11]. In sharp contrast to the scenery found in
most or all human tumors including other leukemia we
have found in CLL a high p27 expression and low Myc
expression. We also found that p27 mRNA levels did not
always correlate with p27 protein, which is in line with
previous studies describing the intense posttranscriptional
[8, 56, 57] and posttranslational regulation of p27 [10, 45,
58]. This argues against the relevance of mRNA-based
studies. Therefore, we determined the p27 levels in 107
CLL samples by immunoblot and signal densitometry.
The results showed a high p27 protein expression by
immunoblot in a majority the CLL cases. These results
agree with previous studies [6-8]. However, in contrast to
previous reports [5], p27 was predominantly nuclear in
our samples. High p27 expression has been reported to
mark rapid progression of the disease [7] but we could
not confirm these results in full as we we only observe
a correlation between cases with ZAP70 expression and
absence of 13q14 deletion with low p27 expression.

CLL cells. Therefore we studied the Myc protein levels by
immunoblot. The results showed a very low expression
of Myc protein in CLL cells. Actually, in a 49% of our
CLL samples, Myc was under our level of detection by
immunoblot. Moreover in most of our patients classified as
“Myc positive”, Myc levels were not higher than in normal
tonsil B-cells. We observed the opposite correlation in
CLL, i.e., high p27 and low Myc in the peripheral blood
CLL lymphocytes of most patients (78%) whereas only
45% of the patients with p27 expressed Myc above the
level detectable in our immunoblots. The low Myc and
high p27 expression that we observed in a majority of
CLL cases is the opposite pattern observed in most human
tumors. It is noteworthy that in the small subset of CLL
samples with high Myc expression we did not detect a
significantly faster disease progression, despite that those
cells show molecular hallmarks of Myc-transformed cells,
i.e., high levels of cyclins A and E. Furthermore, in these
Myc-expressing cells, p27 was found in complexes with
Cdk-cyclins and Cdk2 kinase activity was efficiently
inhibited. We hypothesize that in those cases with
concomitant p27 and Myc expression, p27 overrides the
activity of Myc-as cell cycle stimulator. The hypothesis
is in line with the lack of a clear correlation between high
Myc expression and progression of the leukemia.
We explored whether there is a mechanistic link
between the low Myc and high p27 expression in CLL.
Our results show very low levels of Skp2 in the majority
of CLL cases, in correlation with low p27. Moreover, Skp2
mRNA and protein levels were elevated in those cases with
high Myc expression. This is in full agreement with SKP2
being a Myc target gene which expression in proliferating
cells depends on Myc [41]. As Skp2 is a subunit of the
SCFSKP2 complex that promotes p27 degradation [12, 13],
Skp2 levels could explain the inverse correlation between
Myc and p27 in CLL. Therefore, we suggest that in CLL
cells Myc induces p27 degradation through up-regulation
of Skp2 mRNA in CLL cells. Altogether, the results offer
an explanation for the striking Myc and p27 expression
pattern found in CLL. Further work is necessary to
dissect out the contribution of the Myc-p27 axis to CLL
pathogenesis and their use as markers of the disease.

Helsinki were obtained. The biological characteristics
of the patients (age, sex, clinical stage according to Rai
classification, cytogenetic alterations, treatment and
number of samples analyzed for RNA and protein) or
11q14) are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Control samples were obtained from healthy donors
(peripheral blood lymphocytes) and from tonsillectomy of
patients with tonsillitis (tonsils). CLL cells were isolated
by Ficoll-Paque or flow cytometry using anti CD19. Most
of patients (60 %) were diagnosed in an early stage of the
disease (stages 0 and I). 43 % of patients progressed, most
of these (81%) required treatment. Progressive disease
was considered when at least one of the following criteria
was present: a) evidence of progressive marrow failure
manifested by the development anemia (Hb <10g/dL) and/
or thrombocytopenia (<100x109/L); b) massive (i.e., at
least 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or
symptomatic splenomegaly; c) massive nodes (i.e., at least
10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic
lymphadenopathy; d) progressive clonal lymphocytosis
with an increase of more than 50% over a 2-month period
or lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months.; e)
autoimmune cytopenia that is poorly responsive to
standard therapy; f) constitutional symptoms. 124 lymph
nodes of CLL with ganglionar affectation were also
included in the study. Samples were obtained from the
Biobank of the IDIVAL-Hospital Universitario Marques
de Valdecilla. 16 samples of non-metastatic nodes in
surgical specimens were used as controls.

Analysis of leukemia markers
The percentage of tumoral cells (CD19+, CD5+)
as well as the expression levels of ZAP70 and CD38
was analyzed by flow cytometry as follow. A hundred
microliters of whole peripheral blood in EDTA were
incubated with CD38-FITC (Citognos), CD19-PERP-Cy5,
CD20-APC and CD5-PE-FITC (antibodies from BectonDickinson) to identify surface membrane antigens. Then
cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Fix & Perm
kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and incubated
with the ZAP70 monoclonal antibody (R-phycoerythrin
conjugated; clone 1E 7.2, Caltag Laboratories). After,
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto,
Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose,
CA). ZAP70 results were expressed as the percentage of
CD5/CD19 positive cells compared to T cells (cut-off
20%). CD38 expression was defined as positive when
identified in more than or equal to 30% of the gated CD19/
CD5 positive cells. Cytogenetic alterations were assessed
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the
FISH LLC Multicolor Kit (LSI D13S319-13q14)/13q34/
CEP12, LSI p53/LSI ATM) (Vysis-Abbott Molecular,
USA) At least 100 intact, non-overlapping nuclei were
analyzed. Control values were previously established
based on samples of 10 controls X±3SD (mean plus three

and goat polyclonal respectively) anti cyclin E (M-20,
sc-481) or anti-cyclin E (HE12, mouse monoclonal,
sc-247), anti-cyclin A (H-432, sc-751), or anti-CDK2
(M2, sc-163) (unless otherwise indicated, all rabbit
polyclonals from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p27
monoclonal antibody (K-25020; Transduction Labs),
and anti-Thr(P)-187-p27 (rabbit polyclonal, 71-7700;
Invitrogen). The blots were developed with secondary
antibodies conjugated to IRDye680 and IRDye800
(Li-Cor Biosciences) and visualized in an Odyssey
scanner. Immunoblots quantification and densitometry
analysis were carried out using the ImageJ software. p27
and Myc values were normalized to the actin protein level
in each sample. The mean value of Myc and p27 protein
from of 15 control samples (tonsils and CD19+ cells) were
assigned value =1. Proteins levels of the CLL samples
were normalized against this value

Cell culture and transfection
MEC1 cells (DSMZ-497), derive from human
CLL in prolymphocytic transformation [65], were grown
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum and antibiotics at 37ºC and 5% CO2. MEC1
were transiently transfected by nucleofection (Amaxa
electroporator) with pCEFL-p27, pEYFP-p27, pRS-shMyc
or the corresponding empty vector. A green fluorescent
protein vector (pmaxGFP, Amaxa) was co-transfected to
assess transfection efficiency. pEYFP-p27 was constructed
by inserting the human p27 cDNA into the BamHI and
XbaI restriction sites of pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech).
A hemocytometer was used to count the concentration
of cells. Dye exclusion method was used for assessment
of cell viability. Trypan Blue was the vital stain used to
selectively color dead cells. MEC1 transfected with a p27
expression vector and with empty vector were treated with
10 μM fludarabine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours.

Immunoprecipitations and kinase assays
For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in nondenaturing lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
0,5% NP40, 1mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail)
and protein extracts were cleared by centrifugation.
Protein extracts (1 mg per assay) were immunoprecipitated
with 1 μg of anti-CDK2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and collected on protein G-Dynabeads (Invitrogen).
After extensive washing with non-denaturing lysis
buffer, immunocomplexes were subjected to SDSPAGE and immunoblot analysis as previously described.
For kinase assays, after washing with non-denaturing
lysis buffer, immunocomplexes were additionally
washed in kinase buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH pH7.2,
150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate and 10 mM NaF) and resuspended in
kinase buffer (40 μl) supplemented with 50 μM ATP and
0.1 μg of recombinant His6-p27CK- peptide (HisCK-),
as described [67]. HisCK- vector was constructed by
subcloning the cDNA into the pET28a vector (Novagen),
and the peptide was expressed in E. coli BL21 strain upon
IPTG induction, and purified through Ni affinity columns
(Macherey-Nagel). The kinase reaction was incubated
for 60 min at 30ºC and stopped by addition of Laemmli
loading buffer to the reaction mixture. Samples were then
heated at 95ºC for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE
and immunoblot analysis with anti-p-Thr187-p27 (rabbit
polyclonal, 71-7700, Invitrogen) first and with anti-p27
(Goat polyclonal, sc-528-G, Santa Cruz Biotech.) later.
The signals were revealed with anti-rabbit and antigoat secondary antibodies conjugated to IRDye680
and IRDye800, respectively (Li-Cor Biosciences).
Immunoblots were scanned in an Odyssey scanner.

RNA analysis
RNA was extracted by Trizol or RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from
1 μg of total RNA using Script reverse transcriptase
(BioRad). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the
SYBR Green PCR kit (BioRad). The expression levels
were normalized to the expression of ribosomal protein
RPS14 mRNA. The following primers were used: for
Myc 5’- TCGGATTCTCTGCTCTCCTC-3’ and 5’GAGCCTGCCTCTTTTCCAC3’; p27 5’- CCGGCTAAC
TCTGAGGACAC-3’ and 5’- AGAAGAATCGTCGGT
TGCAG-3’; RPS14: 5’- TATCACCGCCCTACACA
TCA-3’ and 5’- GGGGTGACATCCTCAATCC-3’. The
mean value of Myc and p27 mRNA from of 16 control
samples (tonsils and CD19+ cells) were assigned value =1.
mRNA levels of the CLL samples were normalized against
this value Northern blot analysis for p27, Myc anc Max
was performed as described previously [45, 66].

Immunoblots
CLL and MEC1 cells were lysed in lysis buffer
(1% NP40, 0.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM
NaF and protease inhibitors) for 20 minutes at 4ºC.
Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 40 μg of
lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot
as described previously [45]. The antibodies used
were anti-Actin (I-19, goat polyclonal, sc-1616),
anti-MYC (N-262, sc-764), anti-SKP2 (H-435,

or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) were
used to detect the presence of p27 and Myc. Samples
were mounted with Vectashield (Vector) containing
4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to stain nuclei
and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. For
immunohistochemistry, the CLL, sections of CLL lymph
nodes were arrayed into a new paraffin block using a tissue
microarray (TMA) workstation (Beecher Instruments,
Silver Spring, MD). Immunohistochemical staining for
Myc (Y29 rabbit polyclonal antibody from Dako) and
p27 (SX53G8 monoclonal antibody fom Dako) was
performed following conventional automated protocols in
a Autostainer Plus device (Dako).
