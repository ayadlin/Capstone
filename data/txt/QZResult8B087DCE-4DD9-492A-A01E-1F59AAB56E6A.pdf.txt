ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains a largely incurable, genetically heterogeneous
plasma-cell malignancy that contains – just like many other cancers – a small
fraction of clonogenic stem cell-like cells that exhibit pronounced self-renewal and
differentiation capacities, but also pronounced drug resistance. These MM stem cells
(MMSCs) are a controversial but highly significant issue in myeloma research because,
in our opinion, they are at the root of the failure of anti-neoplastic chemotherapies
to transform myeloma to a manageable chronic disease. Several markers including
CD138−, ALDH1+ and SP have been used to identify MMSCs; however, no single marker
is reliable for the isolation of MMSC. Nonetheless, it is now known that MMSCs depend
on self-renewal and pro-survival pathways, such as AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch and
Hedgehog, which can be targeted with novel drugs that have shown promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Here, we review the pathways of myeloma “stemness”, the
interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment that promote drug resistance,
and the obstacles that must be overcome to eradicate MMSCs and make myeloma a
curable disease.

INTRODUCTION

smoldering MM (SMM), continues to progress to
symptomatic disease as defined by clinical and laboratory
criteria, and end organ damage [9], and eventually leads
to an aggressive, refractory neoplasia, comparable to
blast crisis in CML or Richter’s syndrome in CLL. This
end stage is characterized by extramedullary tumor
manifestation, elevated serum levels of LDH, complex
chromosomal abnormalities on metaphase cytogenetics,
and pronounced drug resistance. Two recent studies have
provided strong evidence that MM is preceded by MGUS
in virtually all cases [10, 11].

MM, the second most common blood cancer (13%),
is a genetically complex, clonal plasma-cell malignancy
that accounts for 1% of all newly diagnosed neoplasms
[1-3]. It is characterized by uncontrolled accumulation
and growth of aberrant bone marrow (BM) plasma
cells, which show hallmarks of pronounced genomic
instability, including DNA point mutations, deletions and
amplifications across the genome, ploidy changes, and, in
approximately half of cases, chromosomal translocations
that rearrange the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)
locus [4-8]. Myelomagenesis is a multistep process
that begins as asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined significance (MGUS), evolves to

(CSC)-LIKE CELLS

derivatives, corticosteroids, including dexamethasone,
microtubule-targeting agents, such as paclitaxel and the
vinca alkaloids, and the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib
and carfilzomib [32, 33]. Although an excellent initial
response to these drugs is often observed, relapse is
unfortunately virtually inevitable. This experience,
underlined by a large body of research demonstrating
that the above-mentioned agents, with the exception of
alkylators given at myeloablative doses, are ineffective
in killing the most drug-resistant MM cells [34], points
to MMSCs as the Achilles heel of current treatment.
Therefore, MMSC-targeted therapies should be a priority
in myeloma. Figure 1 depicts what we believe is a
major underlying reason for acquired drug resistance
in myeloma: crosstalk between canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways in myeloma cells and
microenvironment that regulate the growth and survival
of MMSCs. The Wingless (WNT) pathway, which is
highly active in MMSCs and hematopoietic stem cells
(HSC) [35], increases “stemness”. The Hedgehog (Hh)
pathway, which is elevated in CD138− MM cells [36],
shares target genes with WNT; e.g., the D cyclins, which
are important myeloma drivers [37, 38]. The Notch
pathway promotes stemness, osteoclastogenesis and
angiogenesis; it also activates the NFƙB pathway, critical
for survival, and the AKT pathway, a crucial regulator of
myeloma proliferation, homing and anti-apoptotic activity,
using a mechanism that includes both the silencing of
the AKT inhibitor PTEN [39] and PTEN-independent
changes [40]. MMSCs are further characterized by high
drug-efflux capacity, a common feature of stem cells
[34]. Accumulating evidence indicates that targeting the
above-mentioned pathways individually in myeloma will
not be effective; instead, drug cocktails inhibiting several
pathways in concert will be necessary.

CSCs, a rare subpopulation (<1%) of tumor cells,
are believed to drive drug resistance and disease relapse
in many cancers [12-14]. Although the concept of CSCs
has been around for decades, definitive proof for their
existence was only provided in 1997 when Bonnet and
Dick reported propagation of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) in immunodeficient mice [15]. The investigators
showed that the tumorigenic potential of AML was
restricted to a rare CD34+CD38− cell fraction, but the
tumorigenic potential was not present in ordinary “bulk”
leukemia cells [15]. Subsequently, researchers identified
CSCs in a host of solid and hematological tumors,
including MM [12, 13,16, 17]. As early as 1981, based on
studies with both myeloma cell lines and tumor samples
from patients with myeloma, Drewinko et al. postulated
that myeloma exhibits self-renewal capacity [18].
Although 35 years have passed since this seminal paper
was published, many details about the exact nature and
biological properties of MMSCs remain elusive.
One area of contention is the differentiation stage
of the B cell in which “myeloma stemness” resides. Early
work indicated that MMSCs are post-germinal center
B-cells, either memory B-cells or plasmablasts [19-21].
This was based on the detection of clonotypic somatic
mutations in the CDRs (complementarity determining
region) of immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes
in myeloma cells and peripheral-blood B-cells and is
compatible with evidence that MMSCs do not express
the classic myeloma marker, CD138, on the cell surface,
express less CD38 than conventional or “bulk” myeloma
cells [22, 23], exhibit a CD19+CD24+CD27+ memory
B-cell phenotype [24, 25], and are enriched in the B-cell
fraction of the myeloma SP [26, 27]. It may be safe to
assume that CDR mutations in myeloma were acquired
in a T cell-dependent germinal center (GC) manner in
which normal B cell precursors participated in B-cell
differentiation and subsequently became neoplastic.
However, it is by no means certain that this post-germinal
B cell compartment indeed serves as the reservoir of
MMSC. An alternative hypothesis postulates that MMSCs
are part of the clonotypic plasma cell SP [28, 29] and
exhibit increased levels of ALDH1A1 as well as the
multidrug transporter, ABCG2/BCRP [30, 31].

THE MYELOMA SP HARBORS MULTIDRUG RESISTANT MMSCS
Flow cytometric analysis of most if not all cancers,
including MM, will readily identify a small fraction of
tumor cells that is distinct from the main population by
virtue of functional parameters. This is still an imperfect
method, yet the most reliable one at this juncture, because
it does not rely upon membrane markers, which can
change depending on the microenvironment. Just like in
many other types of cancer, the increased drug/dye efflux
potential of MMSCs is likely to be instrumental in the
acquisition of drug resistance in myeloma [41]. Loh et al.
surveyed 21 myelomas for SP cells and found those in
18 (86%) cases with a frequency of up to 4.9% [42]. We
have observed an increased frequency of these SP cells in
multiple relapsed patients.
Early studies on the mechanism of drug resistance
in SP cells concentrated on multidrug resistance (MDR)
pumps [43], particularly MDR1, i.e., P-glycoprotein.

ACQUIRED DRUG RESISTANCE IS
THE ROOT CAUSE OF TREATMENT
FAILURE IN MYELOMA
Numerous drugs have been evaluated in MM.
These include the antineoplastic alkylating agents,
cyclophosphamide, busulfan, BCNU and melphalan,

Initial results suggested that MDR1 promotes stem cell
expansion via protection from apoptosis [44], but a more
recent study by Zhou et al. demonstrated that MDR1 is
expressed in a more restricted manner than previously
thought and MDR1-deficient mice contain normal
numbers of SP cells [45]. These investigators attributed
the SP efflux phenotype to another member of the ABC
(ATP-binding cassette) transporter superfamily, ABCG2.
Consistent with that, overexpression of ABCG2 in bone
marrow cells resulted in an increased SP fraction. In

myeloma, inhibition of ABCG2 by small molecule drugs,
such as cyclosporine analogs and verapamil, proved
to be ineffective, despite promising pre-clinical results
suggesting that this inhibition may re-sensitize myeloma
cells to vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone
(VAD) and, thereby, prevent tumor relapse [46].
Hirschmann-Jax et al. have recently implicated ABCA3,
another ABC transporter, in drug efflux pathways in stem
cells [31]. Although up-regulation of MDR transporter
genes has been observed at relapse in patients with

Figure 1: Putative multiple myeloma stem cell (MMSC) in the bone marrow microenvironment. The MMSC receives

both tumor cell-autonomous (autocrine) signals and a plethora of para- and juxtacrine signals from a variety of bystander cells in the
tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, these signals govern the self-renewal and survival of the MMSC, the maintenance of its
cancer stem cell (CSC) state and, importantly, the acquisition of drug resistance. This is accomplished by engaging the following signaling
pathways in MMSCs: (1) Notch ligands produced by bone marrow stroma cells (BMSCs) activate a Notch receptor on the MMSC. This
leads to cleavage of the receptor’s intra-cellular domain (ICD) by a γ-secretase, translocation of ICD to the nucleus, and ICD-dependent
activation of genes involved in self-renewal, proliferation and activation of AKT. (2) Binding of Hh signals from auto- and/or paracrine
sources to Hh receptors leads to de-inhibition of Smothened (Smo), which results in activation of Gli, its translocation to the nucleus, and
execution of the Gli-dependent gene expression program. (3) BTK, which is not expressed in normal plasma cells, is often aberrantly
expressed in myeloma including MMSCs. Activation of BTK by targeted phosphorylation in the plasma membrane leads to cross-signaling
with the WNT/b-catenin (4) and AKT (5) pathways. Our research has shown that active BTK in CSC-like myeloma cells results in increased
amounts of nuclear b-catenin, pAKT, ABC transporter drug efflux ability (6) and Nanog (7). Two additional stemness factors that increase
the clonogenic potential of myeloma are RARα2 (8) and ALDH1 (9). Working in concert, in ways that are poorly understood, the pathways
described above increase drug resistance in myeloma and cause relapse with aggressive disease. Thus, the design and testing of MMSCtargeted therapies should be a priority in myeloma.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha 2 (RARα2) a
potential MMSC biomarker

myeloma, additional research is warranted to elucidate
drug export pathways in the course of tumor progression
in myeloma and their relationship with MMSCs.
Heightened drug efflux activity is unlikely to be the
sole reason for drug resistance in myeloma. In a recent
study on the expression of genes encoding cancer testis
antigens (CTAs), Wen et al. found that these genes were
up-regulated in the SP fraction obtained from both human
myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and primary myeloma
samples [47]. Interestingly, one CTA, LUZP7, was
essential for drug resistance in myeloma cells.

Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are a family of
nuclear receptor proteins that mediate the effects of
retinoic acid (RA). The RA signaling cascade, which
regulates the growth and differentiation of normal and
transformed cells, governs a range of biological processes
including embryonic development and reproduction [55].
RA signaling occurs through one of six nuclear receptors denoted RARα, RARβ, RARγ, RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ.
Each RAR gene encodes different transcripts due to
alternative splicing. RARs are activated by two ligands,
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9CRA, and function
as transcription factors [56]. RARα was the first family
member tightly associated with cancer, based on findings
that virtually all cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL) harbor a chromosomal t(15;17) translocation that
results in an oncogenic RARα-PML fusion protein which
promotes cell growth and proliferation at the expense of
differentiation [57]. Our research has identified RARα2
as an important marker of MMSCs [58]. Its expression is
elevated in CD138− cells compared to the bulk myeloma
cells. Enforced expression of RARα2 induced a MMSC
phenotype in myeloma cells with increased SP fraction,
drug resistance, clonogenic growth, ALDH1 activity and
expression of embryonic stem cell genes (e.g., Nanog,
Oct 4, Sox2). Signaling pathways typically activated in
CSCs (Wnt, Hh, Notch) were also elevated. Treatment of
MMSCs with ATRA caused apoptotic cell death, which
could be further increased by adding a Cox2 inhibitor
(down-regulates Wnt signaling) and/or cyclopamine
(inhibits Hh signaling). Consistent with these results,
enforced lentiviral expression of RARα2 in myeloma
cells that do not express the gene under normal conditions
sensitized the cells to ATRA [58]. Moreover, in newly
diagnosed myeloma patients, those expressing RARα2 at
baseline had a significantly inferior outcome. Interestingly,
these patients demonstrated the same gene expression
signatures that we observed in MMSCs.

ALDH1A1 A MEDIATOR OF DRUG
RESISTANCE IN MMSCS
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is
key for metabolic detoxification pathways of aldehydes
derived from ethanol, retinoids, cyclophosphamide
and countless other substrates [48]. Among the various
isomers of this family of enzymes, ALDH1 seems to
play the most prominent role in CSCs [49]. ALDH1 is
commonly deregulated in solid tumors and hematological
malignancies [50]. It is also expressed at high levels in
normal murine and human HSCs [34, 49]. Increased
expression of ALDH1 has been associated with drug
resistance and poor clinical outcome in cancer [51]. Our
interest in ALDH1 was sparked by the possibility to use
this protein as a biomarker to increase the efficiency
with which myeloma cells with increased stemness (i.e.,
MMSCs) can be identified in and fractionated from the
SP of HMCLs and primary tumor samples. However,
we found very little overlap between SP and ALDH1positive cells. Additionally, we sought to elucidate the
mechanism with which ALDH1 drives drug resistance
in myeloma. Our studies showed that expression of
ALDH1A1, the predominant isoform of ALDH1 in
myeloma cells, leads to up-regulation of 9-cis retinoic acid
(9CRA) [52]. Expression of the retinoic acid receptor α
(RARα) remained unchanged. Elevation of 9CRA results
in increased expression of NEK2, which we found to
increase both chromosomal instability and WNT/AKTdependent drug resistance of myeloma cells [53]. In a
follow-up study, we demonstrated that NEK2-induced
drug resistance also resulted in the up-regulation of the
drug efflux pump ABCB2 [53]. In keeping with our
findings in MM, expression of ALDH1 in prostate cancer
is positively correlated with stem cell markers, regulated
by WNT/β-catenin signaling and associated with increased
protection of CSC-like cells from chemotherapeutic attack
[54].

BRUTON’S TYROSINE KINASE (BTK) IN
MMSC MIGRATION AND ACTIVATOR
OF WNT, AKT AND NOTCH
BTK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, the functional
loss of which causes the hereditary immunodeficiency,
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) - a disease that is
characterized by a complete lack of mature B-lymphocytes
and, consequently, serum immunoglobulins [59]. BTK
plays a crucial role in malignancies of the mature
B-lineage, in which it serves as a therapeutic target for
the small-molecule inhibitor, ibrutinib. This drug has
greatly improved treatment options and outcome of
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenstrom
40499

Oncotarget

macroglobulinemia (WM) and mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL) [60, 61] and is now undergoing clinical testing
for relapsed/refractory MM. BTK is not expressed in
normal plasma cells, but is key for BCR (B-cell receptor)
signaling pathways in B-lymphocytes [59, 62]. In
myeloma, up-regulation of BTK leads to increased bone
resorption and homing of MM cell to the BM [63].
Recent findings from our group have strongly
implicated BTK in MMSC maintenance and drug
resistance pathways [62, 64]. Thus, we found that BTK
levels in putative MMSCs are significantly higher than
in bulk myeloma cells. Drug-inducible over-expression
of BTK in HMCLs with low baseline levels, led to the
up-regulation of the CSC markers mentioned above,
including Nanog, a master regulator of the normal and
malignant stem cell program [62]. Approximately 80%
of MM patients express BTK in the plasma cells [62]. In
agreement with these results, a recent study by Yaccoby
et. al. [65] demonstrated that silencing BTK in myeloma
cells increased the growth of individual tumor nodules, yet
decreased the tumor’s metastatic potential suggesting that
inhibition of MMSCs with the self-renewing but relatively
quiescent capacity are critical for myeloma dissemination
[66].
BTK may promote B-cell migration via activation
of the CXCR4-CXCL12 (SDF-1) axis [67]. CXCL12 is a
pleiotropic chemo-attractant for CXCR4-expressing cells,
including HSCs and MMSCs, and retains these cells in
the BM. Because myeloma SP cells up-regulate CXCR4,
they may enjoy increased micro-environmental protection
relative to bulk myeloma cells. CXCR4 blockers such as
AMD3100, have been shown to release CSCs from the
BM niche, thus reducing their intrinsic resistance to drugs
[68]. VLA-4 is another receptor on myeloma cells that
upon binding to VCAM-1 on BMSCs, promotes homing to
the BM. The VLA-4 and VCAM-1 axis is also functional
in HSCs and inhibiting this axis for therapeutic purposes
in myeloma may cause unwelcome side effects; the same
is also true for AMD3100 [69]. One study showed that
lenalidomide inhibits the interaction of the myeloma SP
with BMSCs [70]. However, the SP fraction in that study
did not correlate with CD138− status and the CD138−
fraction was not affected by treatment with lenalidomide.
Similarly, bortezomib, a potent proteasome inhibitor has
been shown to target SP cells in some studies, but was
ineffective in killing CD138− cells [71].
The available data support the contention that
BTK is a promising therapeutic target in myeloma.
Clearly, BTK is upstream of several “stemness” pathways
in myeloma, including WNT, Notch and AKT, but
agreement does not exist whether BTK activates or
inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling [62, 72]. Similarly, by
virtue of activating AKT, BTK may unleash a plethora of
changes in myeloma cells, including increased survival via
regulation of BCL-2 family proteins, elevated drug efflux
activity via induction of ABCB1 and rearrangement of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cytoskeleton via inhibition of GSK [62, 73]. However,
which of these changes matter to MMSCs in ways that can
be therapeutically exploited, remains to be determined.

NANOG, A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR
SWAYED BY MANY MMSC PATHWAYS
Our group has demonstrated that Nanog is a
downstream target of both RARα and BTK signaling, two
prominent features of MMSCs [58, 62]. Under normal
physiological conditions, Nanog is a transcription factor
that, along with other core transcription factors, such
as Oct4 and Sox2, sustains pluripotency in embryonic
stem cells. In cancer cells, NANOG drives the epithelial
to mesenchymal cell transition (EMT), the expression
of other “stemness” genes, and the potential of tumors
to metastasize. The molecular mechanism of NANOG
expression and protein activity in normal and malignant
cells has not yet been elucidated. Based on our data,
overexpression of BTK leads to increased levels of
NANOG in myeloma cells [62]. Our most recent,
unpublished work indicates that up-regulation of BTK
in myeloma cells leads to phosphorylation and activation
of STAT3, a crucial regulator of NANOG. Additional
regulators of NANOG in myeloma are Hh and Wnt, two
“stemness” pathways that are governed, at least in part, by
BTK [62]. Although many details have yet to be filled in,
it is possible that NANOG-dependent myeloma stemness
may be therapeutically targeted using small-molecule
BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib.

INTERACTION OF MMSC WITH BM
MICROENVIRONMENT
In MM, the microenvironment is comprised of
BM stromal cells (BMSCs), osteoclasts, osteoblasts,
immunity cells like macrophages, mesenchymal stem
cells and others [74]. BMSCs can directly stimulate MM
cell survival by direct cell-cell contact; this leads to the
secretion of BMSC-derived IL-6, IGF-1, RANKL, TNF-α
and other myeloma-promoting cytokines. MM cells are
also known to stimulate osteoclast activation and suppress
osteoblast differentiation, creating an imbalance in bone
homeostasis that ultimately results in bone lesions [74].
Interestingly, when examining a stem-like MM cell
population in mice, only the MM stem-like cells engrafted
in the BM osteoblastic niche were capable of generating
colonies after being harvested [75]. This suggests that the
microenvironment has a strong influence on the MMSC
population and their tumorigenic capabilities. Tumorassociated macrophages (TAM) have been described in the
BM of MM patients. These modified macrophages permit
the escape of tumor cells from the host immune system, a
process termed immune tolerance. TAMs like endothelial
progenitor cells also contribute to angiogenesis within the
40500

Oncotarget

MM microenvironment [74]. In healthy bone marrow,
other pathways like parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling
and oxygen-dependent pathways like HIF-1 sustain
hematopoietic stem cells and these could potentially be
hijacked by the MMSCs for their survival [76]. The tumor
microenvironment and MMSCs interact in a way that
protects and promotes the survival of the MMSC. This
emphasizes our need to develop preclinical models that
encompass all of the aspects of MM.

93]. Antibodies, which are more specific for one of the
Notch receptors or their ligands and Notch decoys have
also been developed; both strategies were shown to inhibit
angiogenesis and reduce bulk tumors [90].
BTK activates two important pathways in MMSCs:
Wnt/β-catenin and AKT signaling [62]. Wnt is a classic
“stemness” pathway that operates mainly by stabilizing
β-catenin and promoting its nuclear translocation
[35, 94]. AKT is an important survival pathway that
counteracts apoptotic programs in MMSCs [95]. Thus,
it seems plausible that BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib,
dampen Wnt/β-catenin and AKT-dependent mechanisms
of myeloma “stemness”. An interesting recent study
reported that the anti-myeloma effects of ibrutinib may
be attributed to NF-κB inhibition [61]. NF-κB assists in
the maintenance of CSCs in many cancers [96], yet the
clinical experience with proteasome inhibitors and IMIDs
raises doubt that NF-κB inhibition will be sufficient to
target MMSCs efficiently.
Complicating attempts to eliminate MMSCs is
the existence of inter-convertible CD138−/+ MM cell
populations [97], because it raises the possibility that
bulk myeloma cells replenish the MMSC pool after this
pool has been diminished or eliminated by chemotherapy.
Consequently, curing myeloma will require a concerted
approach that eradicates both bulk myeloma cells and
existing stem cells.

TARGETING MMSCS TO OVERCOME
DRUG RESISTANCE IN MYELOMA
The Hh pathway, which is highly active during
embryonic and fetal development, is only sustained in
those mature tissues that have a stem cell compartment
[77]. Matsui et al. demonstrated Hh signaling in CD138−
myeloma cells but not in bulk myeloma [36]. Hh ligands
are secreted by BMSC [36], but it is possible that
myeloma cells also produce ligands, such as Sonic Hh
[78]. Thus paracrine and autocrine cytokine loops may
drive Hh signaling in myeloma. Hh signaling in myeloma
leads to activation of the ABCG2 drug efflux pump [79],
which may render MMSCs treated with Hh inhibitors
more sensitive to doxorubicin, lenalidomide and other
myeloma drugs that are substrates of drug efflux pumps
[80]. Pre-clinical studies on myeloma have demonstrated
that Hh inhibition may exhaust tumor-initiating cells
[81]. Basal cell carcinomas and other so-called Gorlin
cancers demonstrate the best response to Hh-targeted
therapies because they exhibit activating mutation in
key components of the Hh pathway (PTCH1); however,
activating mutations have not been reported in MM [82].
Notch signaling can sustain CSCs [83] and, in
breast cancer, has been shown to activate ALDH1,
which promotes self-renewal of tumor cells [84]. Notchdependent up-regulation of ALDH1 has not been shown
yet in MMSCs. In myeloma, the Notch pathway drives
cell proliferation, angiogenesis and survival and, via
complex interaction with the tumor microenvironment,
contributes to de novo drug resistance [85, 86].
Furthermore, inhibition of Notch in myeloma hinders
osteoclast activation, thereby reducing a host of paracrine
and juxtacrine signals that would otherwise sustain
MMSCs [87, 88]. Potent γ-secretase inhibitors, such as
MK-0752 that block the Notch pathway, are currently
undergoing clinical testing [89, 90]; γ -secretases cleave
the intracellular domains of stimulated Notch receptors,
which are then translocated to the nucleus where they
function as transcription factors [91]. Even though there
is solid evidence of involvement of the Notch pathway in
MM, mainly through the oncogenic Notch2 receptor, no
clinical trials with Notch inhibitors have been performed
to our knowledge. In pre-clinical studies on myeloma, γ
-secretase inhibitors demonstrate promise and synergize
with established myeloma drugs, such as bortezomib [92,

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Drug-resistant CSC-like cells, such as MMSCs,
which very likely underlie disease relapse, are a key
obstacle for curing cancer. Overcoming this obstacle in
myeloma is an important but difficult-to-achieve objective
because our understanding of MMSC-autonomous and
bone marrow microenvironment-dependent pathways of
drug resistance is still limited. Knowledge gaps remain
in our comprehension of the cellular signal transduction
cascades that govern the maintenance of MMSCs in
vivo. Considering that currently available tools for
monitoring bulk tumor clearance after administration of
chemotherapy are not suitable to assess treatment efficacy
of eradicating the MMSC pool, it will be necessary to
develop better methods to measure therapy responses in
the stem cell compartment that can be used as surrogate
markers for success. The increasing appreciation in the
myeloma community of the MMSC concept and the
realization that MMSCs are best eradicated in an adjuvant
setting at a relatively early stage of the treatment plan,
generate optimism for the future. The design and testing
of new drugs that may specifically target MMSCs, such
as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the Wnt, Hh and Notch
inhibitors, are crucial steps to accomplish this goal.
