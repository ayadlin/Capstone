Abstract
Dysregulated angiogenesis and high tumor vasculature
permeability, two vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)mediated processes and hallmarks of human tumors, are in
part phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent. NVPBEZ235, a dual PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor, was found to potently inhibit VEGF-induced cell
proliferation and survival in vitro and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo as shown with s.c. VEGF-impregnated agar
chambers. Moreover, the compound strongly inhibited microvessel permeability both in normal tissue and in BN472
mammary carcinoma grown orthotopically in syngeneic rats.
Similarly, tumor interstitial fluid pressure, a phenomenon that
is also dependent of tumor permeability, was significantly
reduced by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose-dependent manner on p.o.
administration. Because RAD001, a specific mTOR allosteric
inhibitor, was ineffective in the preceding experiments, we
concluded that the effects observed for NVP-BEZ235 are in
part driven by PI3K target modulation. Hence, tumor
vasculature reduction was correlated with full blockade of
endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, a PI3K/Akt-dependent
but mTORC1-independent effector involved in tumor permeability through NO production. In the BN472 tumor model,
early reduction of permeability, as detected by Ktrans quantification using the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging contrasting agent P792 (Vistarem), was
found to be a predictive marker for late-stage antitumor
activity by NVP-BEZ235. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6598–607]

Introduction
The formation of new microvessels from the existing tumor
vasculature is an essential initial step in the mass expansion
process of solid tumors. This phenomenon ensures proper delivery
of growth factors, nutrients, and oxygen indispensable to tumor
cell proliferation and tumorigenic phenotype maintenance. Moreover, and in contrast to normal vasculature, tumor blood vessels
are distinctly abnormal in structure and function: they are
enlarged, tortuous, and poorly invested by pericytes and exhibit

arteriovenous shunts and blind ends (1). As a consequence,
tumor blood flow is not regular, leading to localized hypoxia.
When tumors reach a certain size, or when located to a certain
distance from existing blood vessels, an angiogenic phenotype
(the angiogenic ‘‘switch’’) is initiated. This is in part due to local
overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF;
ref. 2). In addition, VEGFs are responsible for the hyperpermeable
state of tumor blood microvessels. This increase in tumor vessel
permeability is thought to contribute to the deposition of plasma
proteins, which may provide a provisional matrix for the inward
migration of fibroblasts and endothelial cells into tumors and
amplify the signals important for tumor growth. Moreover, leakage
of tumor vessels may facilitate the traffic of tumor cells into the
bloodstream and the formation of metastases (3).
Inhibition of VEGF expression or activity was shown to prevent
the vascularization and growth of experimental tumors. Hence,
antiangiogenic therapies aiming at affecting tumor vessel formation and function through endothelial cell targeting are attractive
approaches for the treatment of cancer. This includes antibodies
or small molecular mass inhibitors (4, 5) directed against key
regulators, including the VEGFs or their cognate high-affinity
receptor tyrosine kinases Flt-1 (VEGFR1) and Flk-1 (VEGFR2/KDR).
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is of relevance
for VEGF-induced endothelial signaling (6). Indeed, PI3K/Akt
pathway activation in endothelial cells promotes their survival when
cultured in vitro (7, 8) and in the tumor vasculature in vivo (9, 10).
Tumor cells actively participate in this phenotype by secreting VEGF
in the stromal space. This promotes endothelial cell proliferation
owing to increased sensitivity to VEGF because of constitutive Akt
activation. In that respect, Akt is the immediate upstream activator of
nitric oxide (NO) synthase (11) specifically expressed in endothelial
cells (eNOS; refs. 12, 13). On VEGF challenge, production and
release of free radical gas NO in the vascular endothelium lead to
increased angiogenesis and vascular permeability (14).
Genetic alterations in PIK3CA and PTEN genes are often
observed in human tumors. PIK3CA encodes the catalytic
subunit responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-3,4bisphosphate in phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, whereas
PTEN is responsible for the expression of the lipid phosphatase
catalyzing the opposite reaction. Consequently, PI3K pathway
constitutive activation can be seen as a hallmark of tumorigenesis
(15), and PI3K is considered as a well-validated cancer target.
Multiple small-molecule inhibitors aiming at intercepting PI3K
signaling in the tumor cells are currently being tested for efficacy in
clinical trials (16). Given the importance of the PI3K pathway for
endothelial cell signaling, it is also anticipated that PI3K inhibitors
might also display significant effects on the tumor vasculature.

NVP-BEZ235 Reduces Tumor Vasculature Permeability

NVP-BEZ235 is a novel dual pan-PI3K/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that exhibits significant antitumor
activities in a broad range of experimental tumors (17). In the
present study, we investigated the effect of NVP-BEZ235 on VEGFinduced angiogenesis and on tumor vasculature permeability using
the BN472 orthotopic and syngeneic rat mammary carcinoma
model. Results suggesting that the reduction of tumor leakiness
caused by NVP-BEZ235 can be monitored noninvasively and used
as a surrogate marker for efficacy for this compound are presented
and discussed.

Materials and Methods
Compound preparation for in vitro and in vivo studies. For in vitro
studies, stock solutions of PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK), NVP-BEZ235, or
RAD001 (Novartis) were prepared in 100% DMSO and then diluted in
medium at the desired concentrations. For in vivo studies, NVP-BEZ235
was administered p.o. daily either in NMP/PEG300 (10:90, v/v) for
mice treatment (10 mL/kg) or in 0.5% methylcellulose for rat treatment
(5 mL/kg); PTK/ZK was administered p.o. (5 mL/kg) daily in a vehicle of
100% PEG200; RAD001 was formulated as a microemulsion containing 2%
active substance and diluted in 5% glucose and applied p.o. (10 mL/kg).
Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell proliferation, in vivo
chamber implant angiogenesis, and vascular permeability assays. The
effects on VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vascular
endothelial cell (HUVEC) were tested using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
incorporation kit (Biotrak Cell Proliferation ELISA System v.2, Amersham).
The assay was ran as recommended by the vendor and as described (18).
The chamber implant assay has been described previously (19). To assess
vascular permeability in normal tissue, a modified version of the Miles
permeability assay was used. Two hundred microliters of Evans blue (0.5%)
were injected into the tail vein of female FVB mice. Thirty minutes later, the
mice were anesthetized (3% isoflurane in O2, Forene, Abbott AG) and then
placed on an operating field maintained at a temperature of 39jC. Their
ears were extended over a steel cone fitted with a double-sided sticker to
expose the dorsal surface. A 30-gauge hypodermic needle was then inserted
in the skin between the first and second neurovascular bundle of the ear
and tunneled for 4 to 5 mm. Two microliters of VEGF165 (10 ng/AL) were
injected using a microliter syringe (250 AL, Hamilton) forming a 2  2 mm
subdermal blister. VEGF-mediated vessel leakage was quantified by
measurement of the area (mm2) of dye that extravasated at the site of
VEGF injection using pixel-based threshold with a computer-assisted image
analysis software (KS-400 3.0 imaging system, Zeiss) 30 min after VEGF
injection.
BN472 rat mammary carcinoma model establishment, efficacy
studies, and statistics. Female Brown-Norway (BN) rats weighing 160 to
180 g (ages 6–7 wk; Charles River) were used for all experiments. BN472
tumors were established by orthotopic implantation of tumor fragments
into the mammary fat pad of BN rats as previously described (20). When the
tumors reached a size of at least 400 mm3, rats were randomized into
different treatment groups for efficacy studies. Tumor progression is shown
as fractional tumor volume to reflect the increase in tumor mass per animal.
Tumor efficacy was quantified as the T/C (%) [i.e., (DTVol(treated)/
DTVol(control))  100]. Statistical comparisons between groups were done
with one-way ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunnett’s or Dunn’s post hoc
test. The significant level was set at P < 0.05. All statistical calculations were
carried out using SigmaStat v.2.03 (Jandel Scientific). All experimental
procedures were covered by permit no. 1402 (BN rats) and 1325 (mice)
issued by the Kantonales Veterinäramt Basel-Stadt and strictly adhered to
the Eidgenössisches Tierschutzgesetz and the Eidgenössische Tierschutzverordnung.
Tumor vascular permeability assay and tumor interstitial fluid
pressure measurement. Vascular permeability was assessed in rats bearing
orthotopic BN472 tumors of f2,500 mm3 in size. Animals received first
the Evans blue dye (0.5%, 5 mL/kg) via the femoral vein and, 30 min later,
the high molecular weight vascular compartment marker FITC-dextran dye

(100 mg/kg in PBS; Sigma) via the vena cava. Under isoflurane anesthesia,
tumors were then excised and snap frozen 2 min later, and sections were
prepared for the visualization and quantification of fluorescence as
described in the legend of Supplementary Fig. S2. The interstitial fluid
pressure (IFP) of BN472 tumors was measured in conscious, freely moving
rats maintained in their home cage using an adapted fully implantable
miniaturized radiotelemetry system, as described in Supplementary Fig. S3.
Magnetic resonance imaging. All experiments were performed on a
Biospec DBX 47/30 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) at 4.7 T equipped with a
self-shielded 12-cm bore gradient system capable of switching 200 mT/m in
170 As, ParaVision version 4.0 software for data acquisition, and a 1H
resonator with a diameter of 70 mm (Bruker BioSpin). Animals were
anesthetized outside the magnet with isoflurane (initial, 4%; after several
minutes, 2.0–3.0%) in an O2/N2O 1:2 mixture applied with a face mask at a
rate of 0.7 L/min. The contrast agent Vistarem (Ref P792, Guerbet) was
injected as bolus (0.028 mmol/kg) via catheterized tail vein, automatically
by a pulse program controlled infusion pump, after seven baseline
acquisitions (injection rate set to 3 mL/min). The temporal resolution for
dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was
8 s and overall experimental duration was 12 min. Vistarem extravasation
and the procedure for Ktrans measurement in this tumor model used an
adapted TrueFISP method, as described (21). For data analysis, the entire
visible tumor on the MR image was included into the region of interest.
Outliers were determined statistically using Grubb’s test (22). The
significance of changes between the mean values before and after treatment
and between the groups was assessed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
or Tukey post hoc test, for which the significance value was set at P < 0.05.
Immunoblot analyses and immunohistochemistry. For immunoblot
analyses, cells, tumors, ears, or lungs were lysed [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 6 mmol/L EGTA, 1% NP40, 20 mmol/L
NaF, 1 mmol/L Pefabloc SC, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 0.1%, 10 mmol/L SDS,
Protease tablets (1 for 50 mL)]; insoluble proteins were removed by
centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4jC); and supernatants were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Antibodies were either
from Cell Signaling (Akt, S473P-Akt, S1177P-eNOS, and S235/236P-RPS6) or
from Spring Bioscience (tubulin). Quantification of S240P-RPS6 levels was
done on cryoembedded dissected tumor tissue (Tissue-Tek, Medite) after
immersion in 4% phosphate buffered formaldehyde (pH 7.4; J.T. Baker,
Medite, Nunningen, Switzerland) for 24 h at 4jC followed by paraffin
embedding. Tissue sections (3 Am) were mounted on poly-lysine–coated
microscope slides, dried, and stained with clone DAK-S6-240 antibody
(Dako). Detection was ensured by incubation of a biotinylated horse anti-rat
(mouse adsorbed) antibody (Vector Laboratories, Medite) and Standard
Vectastain Elite ABC (Medite) and was followed by visualization with brown
color substrate (Liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System, Dako).
Quantification was done using the H-score, which combines percentage
of stained tumor cells with obtained strength of staining intensity
multiplied by weighting factors. The following formula was applied:
H-score = (low %)  1 + (medium %)  2 + (high %)  3. Statistical
analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA.

Results
NVP-BEZ235 inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The angiogenic factor VEGF
promotes vascular endothelial cell proliferation (23), a prerequisite
for the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, in
physiologic or pathologic conditions. To test whether NVP-BEZ235
could influence endothelial cell proliferation, HUVECs were plated
in growth factor–depleted medium (Fig. 1) and exposed to VEGF in
the presence of increasing concentrations of either NVP-BEZ235
(left) or the potent VEGFR1/2 inhibitor PTK/ZK (right). As
expected, VEGF (10 ng/mL) increased BrdUrd uptake (compare
lane 0 with lane +V, in the absence of inhibitors). Consistent with
previously described studies (18), PTK/ZK reduced VEGF-induced
proliferation with an IC50 of 15 nmol/L (n = 4) and cytostasis was

observed at 100 nmol/L. NVP-BEZ235 provoked a more profound
effect with an IC50 value of 1.8 nmol/L (n = 4) and cytostasis was
obtained at 10 nmol/L. Moreover, at a concentration of 100 nmol/L,
the BrdUrd uptake was less than the one observed in starved,
VEGF-untreated cells, indicative of cell death induction. Biochemical analyses of HUVECs (Fig. 1B) revealed that NVP-BEZ235
efficiently abolished VEGF-induced S473P-Akt and S235/236P-RPS6
levels, showing efficient PI3K pathway inhibition.
NVP-BEZ235 was then tested for its ability to affect blood vessel
formation in mice carrying VEGF-loaded agar chambers (19). In the
absence of inhibitors, the weight of the chamber (Fig. 1C, left;
Supplementary Fig. S1) as well as levels of the endothelial cell
marker Tie-2 (Fig. 1C, right; ref. 24) were significantly increased in
the presence of VEGF. Both effects were significantly inhibited
(P < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner when the mice were treated
p.o. either with PTK/ZK at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg (bottom),
showing the specificity of the angiogenic response driven by the
VEGF, or with NVP-BEZ235 given p.o. twice a day at 20 mg/kg or
once at 30 mg/kg (top).

NVP-BEZ235 inhibits VEGF-induced permeability in normal
tissue. As VEGF-induced vasculature leakage is controlled in part
by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, we anticipated that NVPBEZ235 might affect vascular permeability. To test this hypothesis,
FVB mice were treated with either NVP-BEZ235 (p.o., 30 mg/kg),
PTK/ZK (p.o., 100 mg/kg), or L-NAME (i.v., 20 mg/kg) and
subjected to a modified Miles assay (Fig. 2A, left). PTK/ZK as well
as NVP-BEZ235 treatment almost completely abrogated VEGFinduced Evans blue dye extravasation. Analysis of surrogate, highly
vascularized, lung tissues (right) revealed that NVP-BEZ235
treatment led to strong reduction of S473P-Akt and S235/236PRPS6 levels, consistent with the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitory
activity of the compound. Interestingly, S1177P-eNOS levels were
similarly reduced, suggesting that the permeability blockade by
NVP-BEZ235 might be the result of Akt inactivation, as a
consequence of PI3K inhibition. Acute PTK/ZK treatment significantly reduced S473P-Akt but not S473P-RPS6 levels, suggesting
that only PI3K and not mTOR is required for VEGF-induced
permeability. NO production by eNOS plays a critical role in

VEGF-induced permeability (25) and is directly regulated by Akt
independently of mTOR activity (11, 12). Treatment with the eNOS
inhibitor L-NAME also significantly reduced dye leakage (left),
underlining the importance of eNOS in this model, as described
by others (26). Time course analysis on NVP-BEZ235 treatment
(Fig. 2B) revealed that VEGF-induced permeability is maximally
inhibited for a period of 6 h, with complete recovery observed
48 h after treatment, consistent with the mouse pharmacokinetic of
the compound (17), and shows the reversibility of the inhibition on
permeability (14). To further confirm the importance of PI3K

modulation, mice were treated with the mTOR allosteric inhibitor
RAD001, and local VEGF challenge was performed either 1, 6, or
24 h after administration (Fig. 2C, left). In contrast to the effect
observed with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, a single administration of RAD001 was unable to reduce the dye extravasation even at
the 1-h time point (plasma T max of RAD001). Moreover, ex vivo
analyses of lung tissues showed that S473P-Akt levels were
unaffected (right).

orthotopic rat mammary BN472 model (20) was confirmed by the
fact that p.o., once per day treatment of tumor-bearing animals
with PTK/ZK led to statistically significant antitumor activity (T/C
of 27%) at a dose level of 100 mg/kg (Fig. 3A, left). NVP-BEZ235 was
able to produce antitumor activity similar to PTK/ZK when given
p.o., once per day. The efficacy was dose dependent, with T/C ratio
of 90%, 51%, and 17% obtained at 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg dose levels,
respectively (right). Ex vivo analyses of tumor tissues 6 h after the
last administration (Fig. 3B) revealed that NVP-BEZ235 had, and in
contrast to PTK/ZK, a profound effect on S473P-Akt, S235/236PRPS6, and S1177P-eNOS levels.
To check whether the antitumor activity observed in this tumor
model is linked to tumor vasculature permeability reduction,

BN472 tumor-bearing animals were treated acutely, p.o., with either
NVP-BEZ235 or PTK/ZK at efficacious doses (20 and 100 mg/kg,
respectively), and 4 to 6 h after being subjected to an i.v.
administration of FITC-dextran (vascular compartment labeling)
and Evans blue dye (labeling of plasma proteins in the tumor
extracellular matrix). Analyses of tumor sections (Fig. 3C, left)
revealed that, at comparable vasculature density, the leakiness
observed in the vehicle-treated animals was strongly reduced by
PTK/ZK. This result supports the assumption that the tumor
permeability is VEGFR dependent in this tumor model. NVPBEZ235 showed a similar inhibitory profile as PTK/ZK. Evaluation
of the Evans blue to FITC-dextran area ratios (right) confirmed a
statistically significant 4-fold decrease in tumor vasculature

with either PTK/ZK at 12.5 mg/kg (n = 6),
25 mg/kg (n = 8), 50 mg/kg (n = 7),
and 100 mg/kg (n = 6); NVP-BEZ235 at

14.5 mmHg F 2.0), and 30 mg/kg
(n = 6; 18.5 mmHg F 2.5); or the vehicle
control (n = 9; 18.2 mmHg F 1.5). The
IFP was recorded for 24 h and variations

effects were quantified by integration of the

permeability. Similar observations were made when the A15
syngeneic rat glioma model was used (Supplementary Fig. S2).
NVP-BEZ235 reduces tumor IFP. Solid malignancies contain
structurally abnormal and hyperpermeable vessels. This is often
associated with a reduction of lymphatic vessels, resulting in high
stromal fluid pressure. Reduction of vasculature permeability is
therefore predicted to produce a decrease in tumor intrafluid
pressure. To determine whether NVP-BEZ235 would affect IFP in
tumors, a pressure-sensing catheter linked to a radio transmitter
was introduced in BN472 tumor tissues grown orthotopically in
BN rats (Supplementary Fig. S3). IFP values were then measured
continuously in freely moving animals over a period of 24 h.
PTK/ZK treatment produced a dose-dependent effect on tumor
IFP, as reflected by the decrease of the area under the curve (AUC;
Fig. 4A, bottom). At the highest PTK/ZK dose tested (100 mg/kg),
IFP was reduced by 15% 2 h after administration, reached a
maximum of 30% at 13 h, and was still not normalized even after
24 h. The effect on IFP was statistically significant at doses
equal or above 50 mg/kg, showing that the reduction in IFP is a

consequence of VEGFR signaling inhibition. NVP-BEZ235 treatment led to a similar pattern (Fig. 4A, top and bottom). Thus, a
clear reduction in IFP was already detected 2 h after treatment
( 18% at maximum, 2 h after dosage at 20 mg/kg). Statistical
significance was achieved at doses equal or above 20 mg/kg, when
the AUC values were used for quantifying IFP reduction. At a dose
of 10 mg/kg, a significant decrease of IFP ( 18% at maximum,
6 h after treatment) was obtained during the first 12 h after
application but the IFP returned to initial values by 18 h after
treatment. By contrast, the IFP diminution obtained after 12
and 14 h of treatment for the 20 and 30 mg/kg dose level groups
( 25% and 22%, respectively) did not normalize even 24 h after
treatment. A second treatment of NVP-BEZ235 at a dose of
20 mg/kg (at time point 24 h) resulted in sustained but not
superior IFP inhibition in comparison with the single dose study
(Fig. 4B), with 33% at 2 h, 32% at 4 h, and 34% at 13 h after second
treatment, and not normalizing after 24 h. Hence, at this dose level,
in this tumor model, maximum IFP level inhibition by NVPBEZ235 given at a tolerated dosage regimen was likely reached.

Figure 5. The mTOR inhibitor RAD001 has no effect on tumor vasculature permeability and IFP. A, orthotopic BN472 tumor-bearing rats containing a pressure-sensing
catheter inserted in the tumor were treated once with either 5 mg/kg RAD001 (n = 6; dark line ) or the vehicle control (n = 9; gray line ). The IFP was recorded for
24 h in conscious tumor-bearing BN472 rats and variations (D) were plotted. B, BN rats bearing 2,500 mm3 orthotopic BN472 tumors were pretreated once with
either 5 mg/kg RAD001 or the vehicle control. Four hours after, i.v. administrations of Evans blue followed by FITC-dextran were performed. Animals were then
sacrificed, and tumors were excised and snap frozen. Tumor sections were then analyzed (left , representative images) for vasculature content (FITC-dextran) and
permeability (Evans blue), and Evans blue to FITC-dextran area ratio was calculated (right ). C and D, orthotopic BN472 tumor-bearing BN rats (n = 6–8) were
treated p.o., once per day, with either RAD001 (5 mg/kg; left) or NVP-BEZ235 (20 mg/kg; middle ). C, tumor volume evolutions were recorded throughout the course
of the study and plotted as fraction of the initial volume at day 0 of treatment. On day 6, animals were sacrificed, and tumors were excised and snap frozen.
Tumor sections were then processed for p240/241-RPS6 level quantification (D ) by immunohistochemistry (top , representative sections) and H-score evaluation
(bottom ), as described in Materials and Methods. *, P V 0.05 versus vehicle-treated rats.

To better refine the mechanism of NVP-BEZ235–induced IFP
reduction, a similar study was performed with the rapamycin
derivative mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor RAD001. RAD001 was
previously found to be efficacious at a dose of 5 mg/kg, given
once per day, against a rat pancreatic tumor model (27). At this
dose, the IFP profile of BN472 tumors was unaffected by a single
RAD001 treatment, being almost identical to the one obtained with
the vehicle cohort (Fig. 5A). In the same experimental settings,
RAD001 treatment did not affect tumor vasculature leak, as
revealed by similar Evans blue dye extravasation in the tumor
tissue and Evans blue to FITC-dextran area ratio to the one
obtained with the vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5B). To check
whether RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 would have a different
antitumor activity profile, rats bearing orthotopic BN472 tumors
were treated p.o. with a daily dose of 5 mg/kg (RAD001) or
20 mg/kg (NVP-BEZ235) for 6 days. As described previously,
NVP-BEZ235 produced a strong, statistically significant antitumor
activity (T/C of 17%), whereas RAD001 treatment led to the
expected nonsignificant delay of tumor growth (T/C of 62%;

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

Fig. 5C); note, however, that more protracted treatment provides
a significant antitumor effect for RAD001 in this model (T/C
comprised between 26% and 43% after 2 weeks of treatment at a
dose of 5 mg/kg, given thrice per week). Analysis of the tumors
excised on day 6, 4 h after last administration, revealed that both
drugs equally reduced S240P-RPS6 levels (Fig. 5D), as detected by
immunohistochemical staining, showing that the nonsignificant
antitumor activity observed for RAD001 was not a consequence of
a lack of target modulation in the tumor tissue within this time
course. Altogether, these data suggest that most of the observed
effects of NVP-BEZ235 on tumor vasculature are likely to be a
direct consequence of PI3K modulation and that its antiangiogenic
activity could be accounted as part of its mechanism of action as
an antitumor agent.
The effect on tumor vasculature can be monitored with
noninvasive DCE-MRI. Tumor vasculature variables and characteristics can be visualized and quantified noninvasively by DCEMRI. For instance, the use of high molecular weight contrasting
such as Vistarem/P792 permits the estimation of the endothelial

NVP-BEZ235 Reduces Tumor Vasculature Permeability

transfer coefficient (Ktrans ), a constant directly proportional to
tumor vascular leakage (28). To this end, DCE-MRI imaging on
Vistarem injection was carried out in the course of either PTK/ZK
(100 mg/kg, p.o., once per day) or NVP-BEZ235 (20 mg/kg, p.o.,
once per day) treatment, 7 and 6 days, respectively, of orthotopic
BN472 tumor-bearing animals. PTK/ZK treatment provoked a
statistically significant (P < 0.05, Dunnett’s) Ktrans reduction already
detectable on day 3 (62% reduction versus day 0, and 46% versus
control) of the study (Fig. 6A). This effect was maintained up to
day 7 (74% versus day 0, and 48% versus control), confirming, as
expected from the tumor Evans blue leakage and IFP studies, that
this process is VEGFR dependent. NVP-BEZ235 treatment led to a
similar significant (P < 0.05) Ktrans reduction as early as day 2
(66% reduction versus day 0, and 50% versus control). This effect
was even more pronounced on day 6 (72% reduction versus day 0,
and 46% versus control). When Ktrans changes obtained on day 2
were plotted against the change in tumor size displayed by NVPBEZ235 on day 6 (Fig. 6B), a statistically significant (P < 0.01) linear
correlation was obtained (r = 0.795). A nonlinear mixed effect
(NLME) approach (NONMEM, version V, double precision) was
then used to analyze Ktrans measurements collected as a function of

time and illustrate this last finding. This analysis was performed in
rats treated by 20 mg/kg and provided a good fitting of the data
with a structural model type ‘‘Imax,’’ a log-normal interanimal
variability and combined error model. As a final step, this model
allowed to predict for each animal a value of Ktrans at days 1, 3, 4,
and 5. These predictions obtained, where data were not available,
were plotted versus observed change of tumor size at day 6 for each
animal. This modeling analysis showed (see Fig. 6C) that the
correlation observed before with values of Ktrans at day 2 is in fact
very constant with time and could already be established at day 1
(see Fig. 6C).
Thus, vasculature permeability reduction by NVP-BEZ235 could
be considered as an early biomarker predictor of long-term efficacy,
and this effect can be monitored noninvasively.

Discussion
Molecules such as Avastin (bevacizumab), sunitinib (SU11248), or
sorafenib (BAY43-9006) have received marketing approval by health
authorities based on their antitumor efficacy in the treatment of
specific solid tumors. These compounds have provided clinical proof

of concept for the use of antiangiogenic therapies that target
the VEGF/VEGFR axis. The data obtained with NVP-BEZ235 suggest
that modulation of PI3K biological activity can also exert an
antiangiogenic activity in cellular and in vivo settings.
PI3K is recruited and activated by various mitogenic and survival
signaling pathways. As occurs with other growth and survival
factors (e.g., epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth
factor, and insulin-like growth factor-I), on VEGF treatment,
VEGFR2 (KDR) has been shown to recruit p110/p85 complex, a
phenomenon necessary for porcine aortic endothelial cells and
HUVEC VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation. As previously shown
with other PI3K inhibitors (29), NVP-BEZ235 completely abrogates
VEGF-induced Akt and RPS6 phosphorylation in endothelial cells.
Inhibition of VEGF-mediated proliferation of endothelial cells has
also been reported for mTOR allosteric inhibitors such as
rapamycin and derivatives thereof (30). It has been recently
described that rapamycin influences Akt activation in HUVECs,
suggesting that in these cells PI3K and mTOR pathways are tightly
linked (31). NVP-BEZ235 also efficiently impaired VEGF-induced
HUVEC proliferation but, in addition, displayed significant cell
death induction at the highest concentration tested. These data
agree with the survival function of the PI3K/Akt pathway (32) and
with the notion that VEGF is a survival factor for endothelial cells,
in part through activation of the PI3K pathway (33). Altogether,
these data would tend to suggest that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition
has a negative effect on endothelial cell survival and proliferation,
two critical phenomena in the angiogenic processes occurring in
growing tumors. Evidence that this has an effect on neovascularization in vivo is revealed by the fact that NVP-BEZ235
significantly inhibited VEGF-induced formation of vascularized
tissue around a s.c. growth factor–impregnated implant. It is
unclear if this effect is entirely due to reduced endothelial cell
proliferation and/or increased cell death. The possibility still exists
that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition might also negatively influence
the migration of endothelial cells, which are normally attached to
the extracellular matrix. Moreover, a broad effect on the overall
vessel structure, or on the pericytes, cannot be excluded.
VEGF was originally discovered as a vascular permeability factor,
a protein secreted by tumor cells that potently stimulates vascular
leak (34). Vascular permeability (or leakiness) is a complex process
that can be defined as the movement of fluids and molecules
between the vascular and extravascular compartments and is
dependent on several variables (35). Hence, VEGF is a secreted
factor that regulates angiogenesis and vascular permeability, and
although both phenomena seem to be independent, vascular leak is
believed to augment the angiogenic response (36). NVP-BEZ235
potently inhibited VEGF-induced leakage both in an ear model and
in the tumor environment. In both cases, the observed phenotype
was associated with reduction in S1177P-eNOS and S473P-Akt
levels, which is consistent with the observation that VEGF
regulates eNOS activity in an Akt-dependent manner (11, 12) and
that VEGF-induced leakiness in postcapillary venules can be
readily blocked with PI3K inhibitors (37). RAD001 was not able to
mimic this effect, although strong concomitant reduction in S240PRPS6 levels was observed. These findings suggest that under the
tested experimental conditions Akt-dependent eNOS activation is
not mTORC1 dependent. Interestingly, PTK/ZK treatment did not
significantly affect eNOS activation, although significant vasculature leakage reduction was observed. The likely explanation for this
result might come in part from the pleiotropic nature of the VEGF
response on endothelial cells as several VEGF downstream signal

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

transducers other than PI3K have been implicated in the regulation
of the vasculature permeability (3). Additional biochemical analysis
would therefore be required to decipher the mechanism of action
of PTK/ZK.
In addition to its vascular hyperpermeability stage, the tumor is
also unable to form its own lymphatic system so that solutes
cannot be efficiently drained from its interstitial space. Furthermore, the blood vessels are compressed by proliferating cells and
this increases the microvascular pressure (38). Together, these
factors contribute to an elevated IFP in solid tumors compared
with normal tissues. We describe here for the first time a fully
implantable miniaturized radiotelemetry system that we used to
monitor tumor IFP in nonanesthetized freely moving, unstressed
rats maintained in their home cage, each animal being used as its
own control. Confirming the data obtained with the direct
assessment on permeability, NVP-BEZ235, similar to PTK/ZK but
not RAD001, significantly reduced tumor IFP, already after a few
hours after drug administration. In such a short period, neolymphangiogenic and tumor shrinkage processes could be
considered as negligible entities in comparison with the more
dynamic effect on the existing tumor vasculature.
To associate the effects observed on vessel permeability with
antitumor activity, we examined the effects of NVP-BEZ235 and
PTK/ZK administration on tumor progression in BN472 tumorbearing rats. NVP-BEZ235 and PTK/ZK at their effective dose for
vessel leakage inhibition significantly reduced tumor growth by
83% and 73%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that a decrease in vessel permeability caused by a
PI3K inhibitor has been linked to its antitumor activity. A
similar link has been proposed for cavtratin, a selective inhibitor
of NO-dependent vascular leakage, and tumor progression in
mice (39). The relation between vessel permeability inhibition
and tumor growth observed with PTK/ZK is similar to the one
obtained with other angiogenesis inhibitors such as TNP-470,
caplostatin, and angiostatin (40) or DC101, an anti-VEGFR2
antibody (41).
Distinguishing the effects of direct mTOR inhibition and
inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in experimental tumors is
difficult. Rapamycin and derivatives possess a broad antitumor
activity, which comprises antitumor cell antiangiogenic and
antivascular activities (42, 43), but the dosing regimen is critical
to achieve an optimal antiangiogenic effect (44). RAD001 also
possesses broad antitumor activity, including antiangiogenic
activity, manifested by a reduction in tumor VEGF production
and vascular density (45, 46). Some PTEN-negative tumors,
which alleviate control of PI3K activity and facilitate PI3K/mTOR
pathway dependency, show increased sensitivity to rapamycindependent mTOR block (47). Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are
required, acting at different times, for the proliferation of
endothelial cells induced by hypoxia (48), but prolonged rapamycin
treatment eventually reduces functional mTORC2.
Altogether, the results obtained with NVP-BEZ235 indicate
that VEGF-induced eNOS activation and subsequent tumorassociated vascular leakiness are likely to be efficacy biomarkers
for anti-VEGF/VEGFR and anti-PI3K therapies. DCE-MRI is a
noninvasive imaging technology that measures vessel permeability, leakage space, and partial blood volume of tumors.
These features could be exploited for measuring PI3K target
inhibition in clinical settings. Such an approach has already
been used for early assessment of PTK/ZK efficacy in phase I
trials (49). In our preclinical studies with the BN472 tumor

model, PTK/ZK and NVP-BEZ235 markedly decreased fractional
Ktrans . The observed changes in fractional Ktrans preceded and
were correlated with tumor response, suggesting that DCE-MRI
measurements can be a suitable translational biomarker
strategy for predicting antitumor activity in man. Our data
suggest that NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR catalytic inhibitor,
interferes with tumor growth likely by affecting tumor cells and
their vasculature system. This latter effect might be evaluated
in clinical settings by using a noninvasive technique.
