ABSTRACT
Tumor-angiogenesis is the multi-factorial process of sprouting of endothelial cells
(EC) into micro-vessels to provide tumor cells with nutrients and oxygen. To explore
miRNAs as therapeutic angiogenesis-inhibitors, we performed a functional screen to
identify miRNAs that are able to decrease EC viability. We identified miRNA-7 (miR-7)
as a potent negative regulator of angiogenesis. Introduction of miR-7 in EC resulted
in strongly reduced cell viability, tube formation, sprouting and migration. Application
of miR-7 in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay led to a profound reduction
of vascularization, similar to anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib. Local administration
of miR-7 in an in vivo murine neuroblastoma tumor model significantly inhibited
angiogenesis and tumor growth. Finally, systemic administration of miR-7 using a
novel integrin-targeted biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles that targets both EC
and tumor cells, strongly reduced angiogenesis and tumor proliferation in mice with
human glioblastoma xenografts. Transcriptome analysis of miR-7 transfected EC in
combination with in silico target prediction resulted in the identification of OGT as
novel target gene of miR-7. Our study provides a comprehensive validation of miR7 as novel anti-angiogenic therapeutic miRNA that can be systemically delivered to
both EC and tumor cells and offers promise for miR-7 as novel anti-tumor therapeutic.

system [2]. Angiogenesis occurs locally and is selflimited in time [3]. In contrast, pathological angiogenesis
is often chronic and manifests in autoimmune diseases,
age-related macular degeneration, atherosclerosis and
cancer [3]. In many cancers angiogenesis is required
for tumor progression: when the volume of a malignant
mass becomes larger than several cubic millimeters, the
increasing demand for nutrients and oxygen induces the
production of angiogenic growth factors [4, 5]. Binding
of these growth factors to receptors on nearby quiescent
endothelial cells (EC) in pre-existing capillaries, leads to
their activation, proliferation and ultimately formation of
new vessels [6].
The critical role of angiogenesis in cancer
progression has been validated clinically, and exploited
therapeutically. Current anti-angiogenic therapeutics have
shown clinical benefit for several cancer indications, but
improvement in overall survival scores is minimal in many
others [7, 8]. In addition, the development of resistance
against anti-angiogenic single pathway therapies allows
tumor re-growth due to activation of alternative pathways
and remains a significant challenge for the treatment of
cancer [9].
miRNAs are naturally occurring non-coding small
double stranded RNA molecules of approximately 22
nucleotides in length, which are now established as
important regulatory factors of gene expression in multiple
pathways [10]. Recently their endogenous role has been
shown to apply to angiogenesis [11, 12]. The first miRNA
involved in angiogenesis was identified by Wurdinger et
al. [13] and many others followed [14-19]. The ability
of miRNAs to regulate multiple genes underlying
angiogenesis provides exciting new opportunities for
targeted anti-angiogenic therapy. Uniquely, miRNAs may
combine broad anti-angiogenic activity against multiple
targets with a presumed attractive toxicity profile since
these miRNAs are also naturally expressed in normal
tissue.
In the present study, a human miRNA lentiviralbased expression library encoding novel and known
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miRNAs [20] was screened in EC. miRNAs that inhibit
proliferation of human primary EC and immortalized
vascular EC were identified. The most potent miRNA,
miR-7, was validated for anti-angiogenic activity
in vitro. This miRNA was further validated in vivo
with a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and
a subcutaneous murine tumor model using local
administration and electroporation. With strong support
for its potential as an anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent,
a clinically viable formulation which is based on a novel
integrin targeted polymer-biodegradable nanoparticles
delivery system, was used for intravenous administration.
Delivery of miR-7 using this novel formulation
demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth in a human
glioblastoma xenograft model.

RESULTS
Identification of anti-angiogenic miRNA using a
lentiviral based miRNA library
We aimed to identify miRNAs with a regulatory role
in angiogenesis by screening a lentivirus-based expression
library of 1120 human miRNAs. Viability of primary
(HUVEC) and immortalized EC (EC-RF24) was assessed
in a primary high throughput screen after infection of the
cells. Initially, we identified 110 candidate miRNAs with
either inhibitory or stimulatory effect on endothelial cell
(EC) growth, of which 41 were confirmed in a secondary
screen (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1 for more
details). In general the anti- and pro-proliferative activity
of the lentivirus-expressed miRNAs was more pronounced
in HUVEC than in EC-RF24 cells. In this study we
focused on inhibitory miRNAs because the number of
inhibitory hits was larger and the efficacy of the inhibitory
hits on cell viability was larger than with stimulatory
hits (see Table S1). To further narrow down to the most
potent inhibitory miRNAs, our final selection consisted
6688

Oncotarget

of miRNAs with >35% inhibitory effect in HUVEC
(Table 1). Among the 6 selected miRNAs, hsa-miR-7-3
demonstrated the strongest anti-proliferative effect. The
sequence of the hsa-miR-7-3 lentivirus was confirmed
by Sanger sequencing. Stem-Loop RT-PCR showed that
the pre-miRNA-7 hairpin is processed into mature miR7 (hsa-miR-7-5p, Supplementary Table S2). We therefore
selected miR-7 for further validation as an anti-angiogenic

miRNA candidate.

Anti-angiogenic activity of miR-7 mimic in vitro
The anti-angiogenic activity of miR-7 was first
studied by testing the anti-proliferative activity of
a synthetic mimic of miR-7 in HUVEC at different

miR-7 and miR-scr treated cells were compared to the sprouting of bFGF activated HUVEC. Pictures were taken at 16 hrs after embedding.

quantified by calculating unclosed surface area relative to surface area right after the scratch wound. Data are plotted as mean values ± s.d.

concentrations (Fig. 1a). After transfection of HUVEC
with miR-7 mimic cell proliferation was inhibited in a
concentration dependent manner, up to 50% inhibition
compared to a negative control miRNA with a scrambled
sequence (miR-Scr). To confirm that transfection of
HUVEC with increasing concentrations of miR-7 mimic
led to increasing intra-cellular levels of miR-7, intracellular levels of miR-7 were measured by stem loop RTPCR (Fig. 1b). The anti-proliferative effect of miR-7 was
comparable to that of a positive control, i.e. siRNA against
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a cell proliferation kinase.
The anti-proliferative activity of miR-7 was confirmed
in a BrdU cell proliferation assay (Supplementary Fig.
S2a). Caspase-3 cleavage in HUVEC treated with miR-7
suggests that part of the anti-proliferative activity results
in cell apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2b). To investigate
whether miR-7 also affects EC tube formation and
sprouting, HUVEC were transfected with miR-7 mimic,
seeded on Matrigel at low density, and the formation of
tubules in presence of growth factors was characterized
(Fig. 1c). The results showed a statistically significant
reduction in the number of branching points and
cumulative tube length compared to the negative controls
by approximately 76% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 1d).
Similarly, a three-dimensional collagen based spheroid
assay showed that transfection of EC with the miR-7
mimic resulted in a statistically significant reduction in
the number of sprouts and cumulative sprout length of
EC by approximately 47% and 62%, respectively (Fig. 1e
and f). Since EC migration also plays an important role in
angiogenesis, the effect of miR-7 mimic on wound closure
was studied in an EC scratch assay (Fig. 1g). Indeed, miR7 inhibited wound closure while miR-Scr transfected cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

did not (Fig. 1h).

Gene modulation by miR-7 mimic – HUVEC
culture
One of the hallmarks of miRNAs is their ability to
target and regulate multiple genes. To explain the antiangiogenic properties of miR-7, gene expression analysis
was performed using RNA-seq. Differential expression
analysis showed that 2500 genes were significantly up- or
downregulated after transfection of HUVEC with miR-7
mimic (p-value < 0.05, compared to miR-Scr, Fig. 2a). The
majority, 1317, of the miR-7 modulated genes were downregulated while 1183 were upregulated. Comparison of the
list of down-regulated genes with a list of 11 clinically
explored molecular targets in angiogenesis (Table 2)
showed that eight genes matched the clinical target list.
For each of these “therapeutic targets”, compounds are
presently in clinical development (Table 2). The complete
gene expression profile was analyzed using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis software (IPA). First, the set of regulated
genes was overlaid with the 1051 predicted miR-7 targets,
based on the TargetScan prediction tool in IPA. In total
282 predicted miR-7 targets were up- or downregulated
within the set of 2500 genes (Fig. 2b). Consistent with the
mechanism that miRNA down-regulate mRNA expression,
264 predicted targets (94%) were downregulated while
only 18 (6%) were upregulated.
IPA was also used to identify biological processes
that are regulated by miR-7 (Supplementary Table S3).
Genes involved in functions associated with cell death
and apoptosis were increased, while genes involved

in functions such as cell migration, proliferation and
vasculogenesis were decreased. Overlay of strongly
down-regulated angiogenesis-associated genes (log2 ratio
(miR-7 vs. miR-Scr), p-value <0.05) with predicted miR7 targets (Supplementary Table S4) pointed to O-linked
β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) as potentially
important mediator of miR-7 action. OGT is an enzyme
that adds O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)
moieties to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins and
gained interest as anti-tumor therapeutic target in recent
years [21, 22]. The observed downregulation of OGT in
miR-7 transfected HUVEC was confirmed by RT-PCR
and Western Blot analysis over a concentration range of
15-100 nM (Fig. 2c and d). To proof that OGT is a direct
target gene of miR-7, we measured luciferase activity in

Hela cells transfected with a plasmid containing the 3′UTR
sequence of OGT. The decrease in luciferase activity in the
presence of miR-7 indicates a direct interaction between
miR-7 and the 3′UTR of OGT (Fig. 2e). Mutagenesis of
the 3′UTR sequence of the predicted binding site of miR7 (Fig. 2f) restored luciferase activity, thereby confirming
the specificity of the interaction between miR-7 and the
OGT 3′UTR (Fig. 2e). To study the effect of OGT on
angiogenesis, RNA interference was used to inhibit OGT
expression in EC. As additional positive control Alloxan
was used, which is a well known small molecule OGT
inhibitor [23]. Both siRNA against OGT and Alloxan did
not inhibit EC migration or EC tube formation in vitro,
suggesting that OGT is a good marker gene of miR-7,
but not the prime miR-7 target through which EC cell

to both the PBS and miR-Scr negative control treated
mice (Fig. 4a). Stem-loop RT-PCR was used to determine
the relative tumor amounts of miR-7 in the different
treatment groups. Tumors of miR-7 treated animals
showed significantly higher miR-7 levels compared to
the control groups (Fig. 4b). The biochemical process
underlying tumor growth inhibition by miR-7 mimics was
investigated using immunohistochemical (IHC) detection
of CD31, an endothelial cell marker for microvessel
density (Fig. 4c). MiR-7 mimic treated tumors displayed a
reduced microvessel density, indicative of anti-angiogenic
activity of the treatment (Fig. 4d). However, no differences
in expression of Ki-67, a marker for proliferation, were
detected among the treatment groups (Fig. 4e and f).
These data suggest that inhibition of angiogenesis is the
prime mechanism for the N2A tumor growth suppression
upon intratumoral delivery of miR-7. The lack of efficacy
on tumor cell proliferation in vivo is corroborated by the
observation that miR-7 did not inhibit cell viability of
N2A cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Anti-angiogenic activity of miR-7 mimic in vivo–
chick CAM assay
Mature miR-7 is conserved between chicken,
human, and mouse (Fig. 3a). This streamlines translation
of our in vitro data to in vivo tests for anti-angiogenic
activity, starting with local treatment in a chick
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (Fig. 3b). A
reduction in vascular density in the regions between large
blood vessels was visible in CAM treated with miR-7
mimic while vascular density was not reduced in untreated
or miR-Scr treated CAM (Fig. 3b). This is indicative of
a strong anti-angiogenic activity of miR-7. This was
supported by the observation that treatment of CAM
with a clinically approved multikinase anti-angiogenic
drug, sunitinib, showed a similar inhibitory effect on
vascularization.

systemic tumor neovasculature targeting

Anti-angiogenic activity of miR-7 mimic in vivo–
local tumor administration

Clinical application of miRNA-based therapeutics
is dependent on systemic administration and intracellular
delivery of the miRNA (mimic) to the target site. Studies
have shown an ability of cRGD-targeted nanoparticles
to provide neovasculature targeting and VEGF pathway
siRNA inhibition of angiogenesis in murine models [2426]. Therefore, this approach was selected for systemic

Based on the potent anti-angiogenic activity of miR7 observed both in vitro and in vivo in the CAM assay,
the anti-angiogenic potency and inhibitory effect on tumor
growth was investigated in a subcutaneous neuroblastoma
(N2A) mouse tumor model using intratumoral injections
and electroporation. The miR-7 mimic (10 µg) treated
mice exhibited a 43% reduction in tumor growth compared

delivery of miR-7. Hereto, a novel biodegradable
neovasculature targeted nanoparticles formulation was
developed and used to investigate the anti-tumor activity
of miR-7 following intravenous administration in human
glioblastoma U-87 MG bearing mice. U-87 MG tumor
bearing mice were treated with miR-7 mimic using a
cyclic Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide
coupled biodegradable polyamide nanoparticles, targeting
integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. These integrins are present on
tumor EC neovasculature, as well as on certain tumor
cells [27], such as observed with the U-87 MG tumor cell
line (Supplementary Fig. S6). The results demonstrate
that targeted systemic delivery of miR-7 inhibited tumor
angiogenesis and growth. Tumors of the miR-7 treatment
group were pale and less vascularized compared to those
in control groups (Fig. 5a) and systemic delivery of miR-7
mimic inhibited tumor growth by 42% after two weeks of
treatment (Fig. 5b). The anti-angiogenic property of miR-

7 was also observed microscopically with a statistically
significant reduction of immunohistochemical staining
of CD31 in tumor tissue from the miR-7 treated mice
(Fig. 5c and d). Moreover, tumor tissue from the miR-7
treated mice contained considerable amounts of necrotic
lesions, which is an indication of hypoxia from reduced
angiogenesis. Systemic delivery of miR-7 mimic not
only reduced tumor angiogenesis but also reduced tumor
proliferation as demonstrated by the statistically significant
reduction in Ki-67 staining of miR-7 treated tumor tissue
(Fig. 5e and f). This was confirmed by in vitro studies
that demonstrated reduced proliferation of U-87 MG cells
upon transfection with miR-7 mimic (Supplementary
Fig. S7). To confirm effective delivery of miR-7 into the
tumor tissue we performed IHC staining of OGT, one of
the target genes of miR-7 (Fig. 5g). miR-7 treated mice
showed a statistically significant reduction in OGT levels
(Fig. 5h). Downregulation of OGT by miR-7 is not EC

specific, but was also confirmed in U-87 MG cells in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. S8). The observed inhibition of tumor
growth can thus be ascribed to a combination of an antiangiogenic effect of miR-7 delivered to tumor-associated
EC and an anti-proliferative effect of miR-7 delivered to
tumor cells. Similar to EC, downregulation of OGT in
U-87 MG cells by RNAi interference did not inhibit cell

viability (Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating that also in
tumor cells OGT is a good marker for miR-7 delivery but
not for miR-7 efficacy.

DISCUSSION
This study has identified miR-7 as a prominent

regulator of angiogenesis. In a functional screen with
a lentiviral miRNA library miR-7 was identified as
inhibitor of EC proliferation. The anti-angiogenic
property of lentivirally expressed miR-7 was confirmed
by investigating the efficacy of miR-7 synthetic mimics
in multiple in vitro angiogenesis assays, each focusing
on different hallmarks of angiogenesis. MiR-7 not only
inhibited EC proliferation by 50%, but also inhibited
migration of EC by nearly 70%. In more complex in
vitro angiogenesis assays, miR-7 inhibited the ability of
HUVEC to form two-dimensional tubules on matrigel
and three-dimensional sprouts in collagen. Together, these
studies demonstrate strong anti-angiogenic activity of
miR-7 upon overexpression in EC. In earlier studies, miR7 was not picked up as miRNA involved in angiogenesis in
an EC specific differential expression screen (13), which
may suggest that miR-7 has no physiological role in EC to
regulate angiogenesis.
Apart from the here described newly discovered
anti-angiogenic effect, human miR-7 was first described
by Lim et al. in 2003 [28] and later this miRNA was
found to be associated with anti-tumorigenic effects in
glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and head and neck
cancer cells [29-34]. In these cells anti-tumorogenesis
is modulated amongst others through direct targeting
of both the PI3K/Akt pathway and EGFR [29-34]. Our
observation that miR-7 inhibits proliferation of U-87 MG
cells confirms the anti-tumorigenic effect of miR-7 in
tumor cells.
To elucidate the mechanism of action by which
miR-7 exerts the anti-angiogenic effects, transcriptional
analysis of miR-7 mimic transfected HUVEC was
performed. Pathway analysis of gene expression
changes implicated, amongst others, suppression of
neovascularization. Overlay of the miR-7 predicted
target genes with down-regulated genes with a functional
annotation in neovascularization led to selection of OGT
as putative novel target of miR-7. OGT is an enzyme
that is involved in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
which adds an O-GlcNAc moiety to the free hydroxyl
group of select serine and threonine residues on a diverse
population of nuclear and cytosolic proteins [35, 36].
Downregulation of OGT in tumor cells leads to increased
degradation of the oncogenic transcription factor Forkhead
transcription factor (FoxM1) protein, a direct regulator of
VEGFR-2 and FoxF1 expression in EC [21, 37]. Here
we show for the first time that OGT is a target of miR7, suggesting that the anti-angiogenic effect of miR-7 in
EC can, at least partly, be mediated by downregulation of
OGT. However, inhibition of OGT in EC does not inhibit
EC tube formation or migration, which indicates that OGT
is a suitable biomarker for miR-7 activity, but does not
explain the anti-angiogenic activity of miR-7 in EC. It is
noted that other miR-7 targets, such as EGFR and PI3K
were not down-regulated in miR-7 treated EC based on the
RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Table S7), suggesting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that the anti-proliferative activity of miR-7 occurs through
other pathways in EC than in tumor cells. Investigation
of gene expression levels of known miR-7 target shows
that EGFR and PI3K and most of the other known miR-7
targets are not affected in HUVEC after miR-7 transfection
(Supplementary Fig S10). The mechanism through which
miR-7 regulates distinct pathways in EC and tumor cells
will be subject of future research.
Not only did miR-7 inhibit growth factor
induced angiogenesis in vitro but miR-7 also impaired
developmental angiogenesis in chicken embryo CAM
with potency comparable to sunitinib. In order to evaluate
and validate the anti-angiogenic effect of miR-7 mimic in
vivo, we used a Neuro2A syngeneic tumor model, because
these tumors are well vascularized and respond well to
anti-angiogenic therapy [25, 38, 39]. Tumor treatment
with intratumoral injection of miRNA delivered by
electroporation showed that the miR-7 mimic decreased
angiogenesis and reduced tumor growth. Proliferative
status of tumor cells in the different treatment groups was
comparable, indicating that the primary mechanism of
action for the inhibition of tumor growth in this model
was inhibition of angiogenesis.
Electroporation has limited clinical application since
it can only deliver miRNA locally in superficial tumors.
For broader clinical application, a systemic delivery
system is needed. We developed a novel αvβ3/αvβ5integrin targeted nanoparticles for systemic delivery of
miR-7 mimic to tumor EC and tumor cells and evaluated
it in a human glioblastoma xenograft tumor model.
Indirect evidence for systemic delivery of miR-7 to the
tumor tissue was provided by the observation that mice
treated with the miR-7 mimic-loaded, integrin-targeted
nanoparticles had smaller, pale and less vascularized
tumors than control mice. The nanoparticles developed in
the current study might elicit dual activity, as not only the
EC express high integrin levels, but also in tumor cells.
This suggests that inhibition of miR-7 mediated tumor
growth is caused by a combined effect on both tumor
cells and tumor EC. Indeed, miR-7 inhibits proliferation
of not only HUVEC, but also of U-87 MG cells in vitro.
Furthermore, not only tumor vessel density was reduced,
expression of the nuclear proliferation marker Ki-67 and
expression of the newly identified miR-7 target gene OGT
were also affected by miR-7 treatment in vivo.
The U-87 MG xenograft tumor model was selected
because it is highly vascularized and responds well to
anti-angiogenic therapy such as bevacizumab or sunitinib
[40, 41], making it a suitable model to study the antiangiogenic property of miR-7. Naturally, this model does
not reflect the nature of glioblastomas in the clinic and
recently it was shown that angiogenesis inhibition in
glioblastoma patients may induce glioblastoma migration
and invasion [42, 43]. In this work, the U-87MG model
was used to explore the feasibility of miR-7 as antiangiogenic agent and other therapeutically relevant tumor
6695

Oncotarget

models will be explored in the near future.
The dual targeting of the cRGD-coated nanoparticles
to both endothelial as well as cancer cells provides
potential for high therapeutic efficacy of miR-7. Together
with the well-known role of miR-7 as regulator of invasion
and migration in cancer, the novel anti-angiogenic
property of miR-7 and its regulation of diverse genes
involved in angiogenesis strengthen its potential value as
therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer

protocol (0.5 µl X-tremeGENE for each 96-well). Mimics
(Pre-miR™ miRNA Precursors, Ambion) and siRNA PLK1 (ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool, Dharmacon) were
tested at different concentrations. As negative control PremiR™ miRNA Precursor Negative Control #1 (Ambion)
was used (miR-Scr). Cell viability was determined with
the MTS assay according to manufacturer′s protocol
(Promega).

Tube formation

MATERIAL AND METHODS

HUVEC, seeded in 6-well plate (8x104 cells/
well), were transfected with 50 nM miRNA mimic with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, UK) on the following
day according to manufacturer′s protocol in serum free
medium. After 4 hrs, medium was replaced with EGM2. After 48 hrs incubation, a 96-well plate was coated
with 50 µl MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Transfected HUVEC
were counted, prepared in a cell suspension in EGM2 medium and seeded on top of the MatrigelTM (7500
cells/well). After 17 hrs incubation wells were imaged
with a Nikon TE2000 microscope at 10x magnification.
Tubule formation was quantified by counting the number
of branching points and measuring the total length of
capillary tubes in at least three independent wells from the
same condition using NIH ImageJ software.

Cell Culture and reagents
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells
(HUVEC) (Lonza) were cultured in EBM-2 medium
(Lonza) supplemented with bullet kit (EGM-2, Lonza)
containing several growth factors and 10% Fetal Calf
Serum (FCS) (Sigma). Cells were used between passages
2 and 7. Immortalized EC (EC-RF24) (ABM#T0003)
were cultured in M199 medium (Gibco) containing
FCS (Sigma), Human Serum (HS) (Sigma), 100 U/ml
Penicillin/Streptavidin (P/S) (Biochrom AG) and 200 nM
L-glutamin (Sigma). Immortalized murine neuroblastoma
(Neuro2A, ATCC CCL-131) were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% FCS and antibiotics (100 U/ml Penicillin,
100 µg/ml Streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin
B). Human glioblastoma U-87 MG cells (gift from Prof.
James A. Mixson, University of Maryland, US) were
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS.

Sprouting assay
HUVEC, seeded in a 6-well plate (8x104 cells/
well), were transfected with 50 nM miRNA mimic using
X-tremeGENE (see above). After 48 hrs cells were
suspended in culture medium containing 20% (v/v)
methocell at a final density of 4x104 cells/ml to form
cell spheroids. Spheroids were embedded in collagen gel
containing 100ng/ml bFGF (Reliatech, Braunschweich,
Germany) and allowed to sprout for 16 hrs. Phase-contrast
images were captured using a Hitachi GiGE camera
1.4MB, linked to an inverted Leica microscope DMI3000.
In vitro capillary sprouting was quantified by measuring
the cumulative sprout length and the number of sprouts
per spheroid using NIH ImageJ software.

Stem-loop Reverse Transcription PCR
RNA isolation was perfomed using Trizol
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer′s protocol. The
presence of miRNA was determined by Stem-Loop RTPCR as described in Chen et. al. [44]. mRNA levels were
determined according to standard protocol using homemade primers and SYBRGreen (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
For the stem-loop RT-PCR individual forwards primers
were designed according to mature miRNA sequence in
miRBase 16. The mRNA RT-PCR primers were obtained
from PrimerBank [45]. As a housekeeping gene U6 was
used for miRNA and HPRT, GAPDH and/or BGUS were
used for mRNA. RT-PCR was performed on a BioRad
CFX96 (CA,USA). Sequences of the primers are described
in Supplementary Table S5.

Migration assay
HUVEC were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(see above). 48 hrs after transfection cells were counted
and seeded in 24-well plates (6x104 cells/well). Two
hours after cell seeding a scratch wound was made using
a yellow pipette tip vertically across each well. Wells
were washed and medium was refreshed to remove cell
debris. Images of the wells were taken on a Nikon TE2000
microscope at T=0, 6 and 17 hrs.

Proliferation assay with mature miRNA mimic
HUVEC, seeded in 96-well plate (7500 cells/well),
were transfected with miRNA mimic using X-tremeGENE
(Roche) on the following day according to manufacturer’s

Deep sequencing

Chorio Allantoic Membrane (CAM)-Assay

HUVEC were seeded in a 6-well plate (8x104 cells/
well) and transfected with 15 nM miRNA mimic using
X-tremeGENE (see above). After 72 hrs, RNA was
isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) reagent according to
manufacturer′s protocol. Purified total RNA concentration
was measured using a Qbit®Fluormeter and 30 µg total
RNA was used to create RNA-seq libraries. Isolation of
mRNA was performed using MicroPoly(A) Purist kit
(Ambion) and mRNA-ONLY kit (Epicenter). Samples
were prepared for sequencing using the SOLiD™ Total
RNA-Seq Kit (Applied Biosystem). Relative expression
was calculated as the ratio of reads mapping to a gene in
the miR-7 transfected sample and the reads mapping to a
gene in the miR-Scr transfected sample.

Fertilized white leghorn chicken eggs were preincubated at 37°C with 45% humidity. After 2 days 2-3 ml
albumin was removed from the egg in order to detach the
CAM from the shell. On day 10 after making a window
in the shell, sterile nitrocellulose rings were placed on top
of the CAM. Subsequently, the rings were loaded with
300 picomol miR-Scr or miR-7 mimics complexed with
Lipofectamine 2000 in 20 mM Hepes buffered glucose
(pH 7,4). 200 picomol Sunitinib (Sequoia Research
Products) was used as positive control. On day 10 and
12 CAMs were photographed in ovo with a Olypmus e40
camera.

Neuroblastoma in vivo model: local delivery

3′-UTR luciferase assay

The neuroblastoma (Neuro2A) tumor growth
experiment was a randomized blinded study performed
under approval of the University of Utrecht animal ethics
committee. The protocol is adapted from Vader et. al [46].
Six to eight weeks old normal male A/J mice (Harlan)
housed in environmentally controlled rooms, were injected
subcutaneously in the right flank with 100 µl Neuro2A
cells (1x107 cells/ml). Tumor sizes were measured daily
with digital calipers and tumor volume was calculated
by using the following formula: (width2 x length) x 0.52.
Treatment started with a tumor volume between 40-70
mm3 by intratumoral injection of 10 µg of miRNA every
other day followed by electroporation at a setting of 200V/
cm using an ECM 830 electroporator (BTX) set to deliver
2x2 pulses at perpendicular angles (n=7 per group) [47].
On day 11 mice were sacrificed and the tumors were
excised.

The 3′UTR sequences (Supplementary Table S6)
were synthesized by IDT technologies, and cloned into
psiCHECKTM-2 (Promega). Hela cells seeded in 24-well
plated, were co-transfected with 10 nM miR-7 or miRScr and 100ng/well 3′UTR psiCHECKTM-2 construct
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturers protocol. After 48 hrs, cells were lysed
using Passive Lysis Buffer and luciferase activity was
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega) and Glomax-Multi Detection system
(Promega) in 96-well format according to manufacturer′s
protocol.

Immunoblotting
HUVEC, seeded in a 6-well plate (8x104 cells/well),
were transfected at different concentrations of miR-7 using
X-tremeGENE (see above). After 48 hrs cells were lysed
in 200 µl radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(ThermoFisher) containing protease inhibitors (1x) and
EDTA(1x) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at
4°C at 13,500 RCF for 15 min to remove the debris. Equal
amounts of protein were run on SDS-PAGE gels and
subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots
were incubated with primary antibodies OGT (1:1000.
Cell Signaling) and Beta Actin (1:1000. Cell Signaling)
followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(Cell signaling). Bands were visualized with SuperSignal
West Femto Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Images
were acquired with Gel Doc XRS imaging system with
quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). All images
shown are representative of 3 independent experiments.

AparnaBio′s cRGD-targeted biodegradable delivery
system (cRGD-PPC) was used for systemic delivery of
microRNA mimics in vivo [48]and Liu et al. (manuscript
in preparation). miRNA/polymer nanoparticle were
prepared at room temperature by dissolving miRNA in
HGB (20 mM HEPES, 5% Glucose, pH 7.1). An equal
volume of the polymer solution was mixed with miRNA
solution (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) to achieve a molar
ratio of polymer nitrogen to RNA phosphate (N/P ratio)
of 6. Mixed solutions were then briefly vortexed and left
for equilibration for 30 min at room temperature to allow
nanoparticle formation.

Systemic delivery of miR-7 nanoparticles in
tumor bearing mice was a randomized, blinded study
which was performed in an AALAC certified vivarium
(Biomedical Research Institute, Rockville, MD, USA).
Five to six weeks old female athymic mice (Athymic
Nude-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, USA) housed
in environmentally controlled rooms ,were inoculated with
U-87 MG cells (5x106 cells/ml suspended in 1:1 PBS/

in the same way as described above. Mice were treated by
intravenous injection every other day with the cRGD-PPC
nanoparticles containing 60 µg miRNA mimic, or mir-Scr,
(n=10 mice per group, 3 mg/kg). PBS was used as control.
One day after the 8th injection mice were sacrificed and the
tumors were excised.

Mouse tumors were formalin-fixed, paraffin
embedded and 6 µm sections were cut for immunostaining.
Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in
a graded series of alcohol baths, blocked in 5% normal
goat serum (Dako) and subsequently incubated either with
rabbit anti-mouse CD31 antibody (1:500)(Santa Cruz),
with rabbit anti-mouse Ki-67 antibody (1:300)(Abcam),
or with rabbit anti-mouse OGT antibody (1:500)(Cell
Signaling). Next, sections were incubated with 0.3%
H2O2/PBS, followed by polyHRP goat anti-rabbit IgG
incubation (Bright Vision). Finally, antibody binding was
visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB).
