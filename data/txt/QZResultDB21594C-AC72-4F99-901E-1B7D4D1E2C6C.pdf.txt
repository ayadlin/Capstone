Abstract
Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, increases brain parenchymal extracellular fluid (ECF) accumulation of topotecan, a substrate of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
P-glycoprotein (Pgp/MDR-1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). The effect of modulating
these transporters on topotecan penetration in gliomas has not been thoroughly studied. Thus, we performed
intracerebral microdialysis on mice bearing orthotopic human gliomas (U87 and MT330) and assessed topotecan tumor ECF (tECF) penetration and the effect of gefitinib on topotecan tECF penetration and intratumor
topotecan distribution. We found that topotecan penetration (Ptumor) of U87 was 0.96 ± 0.25 (n = 7) compared
with that of contralateral brain (Pcontralateral, 0.42 ± 0.11, n = 5; P = 0.001). In MT330 tumors, Ptumor (0.78 ± 0.26,
n = 6) and Pcontralateral (0.42 ± 0.11, n = 5) also differed significantly (P = 0.013). Because both tumor models had
disrupted blood-brain barriers and similar Ptumor values, we used U87 and a steady-state drug administration
approach to characterize the effect of gefitinib on topotecan Ptumor. At equivalent plasma topotecan exposures,
we found that Ptumor after gefitinib administration was lower. In a separate cohort of animals, we determined
the volume of distribution of unbound topotecan in tumor (Vu,tumor) and found that it was significantly higher
in groups receiving gefitinib, implying that gefitinib administration leads to a greater proportion of intracellular topotecan. Our results provide crucial insights into the role that transporters play in central nervous
system drug penetration and provide a better understanding of the effect of coadministration of transporter
modulators on anticancer drug distribution within a tumor. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4499–508. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Most central nervous system (CNS) tumors, particularly
gliomas, are resistant to chemotherapy (1). Drug resistance
in brain tumors is not well understood but may involve poor
tumor cell exposure (2), which can be caused by several mechanisms. One important mechanism involves active drug efflux from the endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) by specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
(3). The irregular distribution of tumor vessels, the absence
of lymphatics, and high oncotic pressure can also impede drug
penetration to tumor cells distant from vessels (2). Further,
some tumor cells can actively export xenobiotics via ABC transporters at the cell membrane (4). Intracellular drug exposure is

crucial to the effectiveness of agents such as methotrexate
(antimetabolite), paclitaxel (tubulin inhibitor), and the camptothecins (topoisomerase I inhibitors), to which cells overexpressing specific ABC transporters acquire resistance (5–7).
The semisynthetic camptothecin analogue topotecan is active against xenografted human CNS tumors (8, 9) but shows
little efficacy against high-grade gliomas in clinical trials (10).
Poor drug penetration may contribute to this outcome. We
and others observed that topotecan penetration of brain parenchyma is restricted by at least two ABC transporters: breast
cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) and P-glycoprotein
(Pgp/MDR1/ABCB1; refs. 11, 12). Further, we found that the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib increased topotecan
penetration into the brain extracellular fluid (ECF; refs. 11,
13). Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor,
also increased the bioavailability of oral irinotecan in mice
(14) and humans (15) and reversed tumor cell resistance to
topotecan and irinotecan (7, 16), likely via inhibition of BCRP
and Pgp (6, 7). Several other TKIs are modulators of ABC transporters and have been studied, in combination with transporter-substrate chemotherapy agents, to overcome tumor drug
resistance or to increase drug bioavailability (17–20).
The effect of ABC transporter inhibition on drug penetration
of orthotopic brain tumor models is unknown. The BBB remains functionally intact at the margins of invasive brain tumors, where malignant cells migrate through vessel co-option
to adjacent tissues (21, 22); therefore, inhibitors of active drug

efflux at the BBB may increase drug concentration in the tumor
ECF (tECF; ref. 11). Efflux transporters have also been found
in the neovasculature of the glioma tumor bulk (23, 24). However, because tumor-secreted angiogenic molecules (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor) increase the permeability of
vessels within the tumor bulk (25), it is unclear whether the
activity of efflux transporters (and their inhibitors) is significant in these hyperpermeable tumor regions. Finally, if the
tumor itself expresses ABC transporters, an inhibitor could
act at the tumor cell level to increase topotecan intracellular
penetration. Here, we used a combined microdialysis-tumor
homogenate technique to compare the distribution of topotecan in the tECF and cells of orthotopic glioma xenografts in
the presence versus absence of the pump inhibitor gefitinib.
We hypothesized that gefitinib would increase intracellular
drug accumulation in ABC transporter-expressing tumors
with a permeable BBB by modulating cellular drug efflux.

Materials and Methods
Tumor lines
Two human glioma cell lines were used: U-87 MG (U87)
and MT330. The U87 model has been extensively described
(26). MT330 was created from a WHO grade 4 glioma sample
obtained from a patient at University Methodist Hospital
(Memphis, TN) as part of an Institutional Review Board–
approved protocol. Both tumor lines, modified to stably express
firefly luciferase (27), were donated by Dr. Andrew Davidoff
(St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Memphis, TN).
Orthotopic tumor xenografts
Animal procedures were approved by the St. Jude Animal
Care and Use Committee. CD1 athymic nude mice (8–12 wk
old; Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized with
100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine and injected
with 5 × 105 U87 or MT330 cells suspended in 5 μL Matrigel
(Becton Dickinson). With the guidance of a mouse brain
atlas (28), cells were injected stereotactically (David Kopf
Instruments) into the right caudate putamen.
Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence (IVIS100 imaging system, Xenogen; ref. 29). Briefly, mice were injected i.p. with 120 mg/kg D-luciferin firefly (potassium salt;
Caliper Lifesciences) and imaged under isoflurane anesthesia
after 5 minutes. Tumor vascular permeability was assessed
by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI; see Supplementary Data for details).
Topotecan penetration of tECF
The concentration-time profiles of unbound drugs in tissue ECF can be characterized by microdialysis sampling coupled with an analytic method (30). We used this technique to
measure the penetration of unbound topotecan lactone into
tumor or brain ECF after a single i.v. injection of topotecan,
as previously described (31). Briefly, a microdialysis guide
cannula (MD-2255, Bioanalytical Systems) was stereotactically implanted on the day of tumor injection, either at the
tumor coordinates or in the corresponding contralateral
brain area. An additional group was cannulated but not in-

oculated with tumor. Cannulae were attached to the skull
surface with dental cement and two screw anchors (MF5182, Bioanalytical Systems). Microdialysis experiments were
performed 14 to 21 days (U87) or 45 to 65 days (MT330) after
tumor implantation in animals whose intracranial bioluminescence signal was at least 108 photons per second or (in
control animals) at least 3 days after implantation of the cannula. On the day of the experiment, a microdialysis probe
(MBR-1-5, Bioanalytical Systems) was inserted through the
cannula, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; ref. 31) was perfused at 0.5 μL/min, and the probe membrane was allowed to
equilibrate for 1 hour. Topotecan (4 mg/kg) was then administered, and dialysate samples were collected every 18 minutes.
Samples were analyzed for topotecan lactone and carboxylate
with an automated microbore high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fluorescence detection system until concentrations were unmeasurable (31). Probe recovery was
calculated by retrodialysis as previously described (31). Using
a previously described limited sampling strategy (13), we bled
each mouse from the retro-orbital plexus 15, 60, and 180 minutes after the i.v. injection to assay plasma topotecan lactone.
The unbound plasma topotecan concentration was calculated
on the basis of a previous study (13), showing a 27% unbound
fraction in CD1 nude mice. Unbound plasma topotecan levels
were modeled by maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian
estimation with ADAPT 5 software (Biomedical Simulations
Resource; ref. 32). The prior parameter distribution was calculated by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version
VI; ref 33) in an independent group of mice receiving the same
topotecan dose, as previously described (11).
The simulated concentration-time data from the ADAPT 5
model estimates were integrated to obtain the area under the
concentration-time curve defining plasma exposure to unbound topotecan lactone (AUCu,plasma). Similarly, unbound
drug exposure in the dialyzed tissue (brain or tumor) ECF
(AUCu,tissueECF) was determined in each mouse (after correcting for probe recovery as previously described; ref. 31) by
three-compartment analysis of combined plasma and tissue
topotecan lactone pharmacokinetic data (11). Finally, the
extent of penetration of the targeted tissue by unbound
topotecan lactone (Ptissue) was calculated as the tissue (brain
or tumor) ECF-to-plasma AUC ratio (34):
Ptissue ¼

AUCu;tissueECF
AUCu;plasma

The probe location was confirmed histologically at the end
of all microdialysis experiments. In studies targeting tumor
tissue, animals that had the probe outside the tumor were
excluded from the analysis.
Western blots and immunohistochemistry for ABC
transporters
Western blots of U87, MT330, and control cell lysates (Saos-2BCRP, LLC-PK1-MDR1, LS180-MRP1, and Saos-2-MRP4, stably
transfected with BCRP, Pgp, MRP1, and MRP4, respectively)
were performed following previously published methods (35).
Membranes were incubated with 1:400 anti-BCRP (Bxp-21;
Kamiya Biomedical), 1:400 anti-Pgp (C219), 1:1,000 anti-MRP1

For immunohistochemistry, the antibodies Bxp-21
(0.5 μg/mL), JSB-1 (anti-Pgp; 1 μg/mL; Millipore Corp.),
MRPr1 (2 μg/mL), and M4I-10 (3 μg/mL) were used according
to published protocols (13). Mouse IgG and rat IgG2a were
used as negative controls.
Effect of gefitinib on topotecan tECF penetration
We maintained a constant (steady-state) topotecan concentration in plasma (Css,plasma) to evaluate the real-time effect of a single oral dose of gefitinib (200 mg/kg) on the
topotecan tECF penetration. A topotecan-loaded miniosmotic pump (Alzet model 2001D; Durect) was s.c. implanted
in the CD1 nude mice; its ability to maintain a 100 ng/mL
plasma topotecan lactone concentration for 24 hours had
been confirmed in a group of five wild-type FVB mice (data
not shown). To achieve a plasma topotecan lactone Css of
>100 ng/mL (bound + unbound) in U87 tumor-bearing mice,
we loaded the pump with 4 mg/mL topotecan in sterile water, which was released at 25 μg/h for 24 hours.
For microdialysis studies, the probe recovery was calculated by retrodialysis before the pharmacokinetic experiment.
Then, the probe was washed by perfusion for 1 hour with
aCSF at 2 μL/min. Mice were then anesthetized with isoflurane, a topotecan-loaded pump previously primed in 0.9%
saline (3 h, 37°C) was surgically inserted under the skin of
the back, and the incision was sutured. The aCSF flow rate
was then reduced to 0.5 μL/min, and dialysate samples were
collected overnight every 18 minutes, as described above. The
next morning (12–14 h after pump insertion), a plasma
sample was obtained to characterize unbound C ss,plasma
and a 200 mg/kg gefitinib dose was administered orally as
previously described (13). Dialysate sample collection and
analysis continued for 8 to 10 hours, and plasma samples
were obtained retro-orbitally 4, 6, and 8 hours after gefitinib
administration. The Css of unbound topotecan lactone in
tECF (Css,tECF) was calculated before (mean concentration
of dialysate samples collected 6–14 h after pump insertion)
and after (mean concentration of dialysate samples collected
6–8 h after gefitinib) the gefitinib dose. The steady-state
penetration of tECF (Ptumor) by unbound topotecan lactone
was calculated as the Css,tECF/Css,plasma ratio (34).
Intratumor distribution of topotecan
To determine the proportion of drug either entrapped in
the intracellular compartment or nonspecifically bound to
tumor tissue components, in relation to the unbound drug
fraction in the tECF, we applied the “unbound drug volume
of distribution in tumor” (Vu,tumor) parameter, adapted from
Wang and Welty (36). Vu,tumor describes the relationship, at
the steady state, between the total drug concentration in the
tumor (assayed in homogenized tissue) and the unbound
drug concentration in tECF (calculated by microdialysis).
Vu,tumor is measured in mL/g tumor:
Vu;tumor ¼

Atot;tumor −Vtot;blood Ctot;blood
Css;tECF

where Atot,tumor is the total quantity of drug per gram of
tumor homogenate (including blood present in the tumor),
Vblood is the volume of blood per gram of tumor, Ctot,blood
is the total concentration of drug in blood, and Css,tECF is
the measured concentration of unbound drug in the tECF.
We obtained experimental Atot,tumor and Ctot,blood data by
performing studies in additional groups of mice bearing U87
tumors using timing similar to that described above. One
group, TPT25 (n = 8), received pump-infused topotecan at
a constant rate of 25 μg/h. These animals were sacrificed
8 to 12 hours after insertion of the pump (at steady state),
and blood and tumor tissues were harvested for HPLC drug
assays, performed as already published (37). The effect of
gefitinib on the V u,tumor parameter was assessed in two
additional groups of U87 tumor-bearing mice. The TPT25GEF group (n = 7) received topotecan at 25 μg/h and received
oral gefitinib (200 mg/kg) 8 hours before sacrifice. The
TPT12-GEF group (n = 6) received an adjusted dose of topotecan (12.5 μg/h) to achieve systemic exposure (Css,plasma)
comparable with that in the TPT25 group and received oral
gefitinib (200 mg/kg) 8 hours before sacrifice. Tumors were
immediately frozen and stored at −80°C. For drug analysis,
tumors were weighed and homogenized ultrasonically (CP50, Cole-Parmer) at 4°C in water (10 μL/mg of tumor). The
tumor suspension (200 μL) was mixed vigorously with 800 μL
of cold methanol and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000
rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered in Spin-X Centrifuge
filter tubes (Costar) at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes. Filtrates were stored at −80°C for HPLC assay.
To estimate the V u,tumor parameter in the TPT25 and
TPT25-GEF groups, we used the mean Css,tECF values obtained in the previous steady-state microdialysis experiments. The value Vblood for intracranial U87 tumors in mice
was obtained from the literature (4.1%; ref. 38). In the TPT12GEF group, we performed a new set of microdialysis experiments (n = 3) to obtain the Css,tECF value (as described above)
in animals bearing U87 tumors and colocalized microdialysis
cannulae; in this group, gefitinib (200 mg/kg, oral) was administered 30 minutes before insertion of a pump dispensing
12.5 μg/h of topotecan. Dialysate samples were collected 8 to
10 hours after insertion, and a blood sample was obtained
8 hours after gefitinib administration.
Intracellular accumulation of topotecan in vitro
Cells (5 × 105 per well in 2 mL medium) were incubated
overnight in six-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson), and 2 mL of medium containing topotecan (final concentration, 1 μmol/L) with or without gefitinib (final
concentration, 10 μmol/L) were then added. After incubation at 37°C for 1, 5, or 10 minutes, the medium was rapidly
aspirated to terminate drug accumulation, and the wells
were washed with ice-cold PBS (2 × 5 mL). Ice-cold water
was added (500 μL/well), and cell suspensions were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes on ice. Samples were suspended ultrasonically, and 100 μL of suspension were
added to 400 μL of cold methanol. The mixture was mixed
vigorously and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm
at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered in a Costar Spin-X

test (for nonnormally distributed data) were used for nonpaired
comparisons of two groups. For the comparison of more
than two groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed followed
by a post hoc t test with Bonferroni correction.

Results
Glioma morphology and growth in vivo
We studied drug penetration of gliomas by orthotopically
implanting the most frequently used glioma cell line (U87)
and a new low-passage primary tumor line (MT330). The
tumor cells engrafted in 100% (58 of 58, U87) and 85%
(17 of 19, MT330) of inoculated animals. U87 tumors, as
previously described (39), were round and noninfiltrative
(Fig. 1A); had profuse, uniform vascularization; and were easily
dissected from surrounding brain under a dissecting microscope. In contrast, MT330 tumors infiltrated contiguous
brain parenchyma, had irregular edges, had inhomogeneous
core vasculature, and could be dissected only by using a
bioluminescence-guided technique.
Tumor growth, as measured by increased bioluminescence
signal (29), was also dissimilar (Fig. 1B): U87 tumors were >50
mm3 (assessed by terminal dissection) 2 to 3 weeks after implantation, and most animals showed neurologic signs (altered balance and lethargy) within 3 weeks. MT330 tumors
grew slowly for several weeks before reaching the luminescence intensity and tumor volume (47 ± 14 mm3 as assessed
by MRI, as specified in the Supplementary Data, at week 15;
n = 5 mice) of U87 tumors.
Permeability of the tumor vasculature
We chose to characterize the BBB of our tumor models
using a CE-MRI approach. If the BBB were disrupted, CNS

drug penetration would be altered and it would be possible
to assess the effect of ABC transporter inhibitors at the level
of tumor cells (not tumor vessel). Using CE-MRI, we characterized the vascular integrity of both U87 and MT330, and
images showed significant contrast enhancement, which
confirmed an impaired BBB (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Homogeneous enhancement was observed in U87 tumors,
significantly greater than enhancement in the contralateral
brain tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Contrast in MT330
tumors was inhomogeneous, with areas of high signal intensity that may have indicated heavy vascularization and/or
necrosis.
Topotecan penetration of tECF
We anticipated greater drug concentrations within U87 and
MT330 tECF than in normal brain tissue ECF because of the
greater vascular permeability of the tumors. Our previous microdialysis studies showed the exposure of brain ECF to unbound topotecan lactone to be 21% to 36% that of plasma
after a 4 mg/kg i.v. bolus injection in FVB mice (11, 13). Here,
using an identical experimental setup, we first evaluated brain
ECF penetration in nontumor-bearing CD1 nude mice; results
were within the range previously reported (Pbrain = 0.30 ±
0.11, n = 7). We then compared tECF versus contralateral
brain ECF penetration in animals bearing U87 and MT330
tumors. Unbound drug penetration of U87 tECF (Ptumor =
0.96 ± 0.25, n = 7) was 2.3 times that of contralateral brain
ECF Pcontralateral = 0.42 ± 0.11, n = 5; P = 0.001, t test; Fig. 2A).
In MT330 tumors, Ptumor (0.78 ± 0.26, n = 6) and Pcontralateral
(0.42 ± 0.11, n = 5) also differed significantly (2.2-fold;
P = 0.013, t test). Pcontralateral values did not differ statistically
from Pbrain values in the nontumor-bearing mice. Tumor
targeting (% experiments with probe in tumor) was more

accurate in the U87 model (88%) than in the MT330 model
(55%). Figure 2B shows representative experiments.
Expression of ABC transporters in tumor lines and
xenografts
Because one of our objectives was to evaluate the effect of
inhibition of tumor cell ABC transporters on drug penetration, we examined the presence of these transporters by
Western blot (in the cell lines) and immunohistochemistry
(in the xenografts). As shown in Fig. 3A, BCRP, MRP1, and
MRP4 were present in both tumor lines, whereas Pgp was
not detected. In the U87 and MT330 xenografts, BCRP and
MRP1 were strongly expressed, and Pgp and MRP4 were
expressed moderately or weakly (Fig. 3B).
Gefitinib shifts intratumor topotecan distribution
toward the intracellular compartment
To describe drug distribution in the tECF, vascular, and intracellular tumor compartments, we maintained a constant
plasma drug concentration, determined the Css,tECF/Css,plasma
ratio (Ptumor), and estimated intratumor distribution (Vu,tumor)
by using combined data sets obtained from microdialysis and
homogenate samples. This strategy allowed us to (a) use fewer
animals than studies using i.v. injections, which require
serial tissue samples; (b) characterize the real-time effects of
gefitinib on topotecan pharmacokinetics; and (c) achieve
equivalent systemic exposures in animal groups that did and
did not receive gefitinib.
We previously showed that gefitinib (likely through its interaction with ABC transporters) halves topotecan lactone
plasma clearance (11, 13). In our steady-state studies,
Css,plasma (unbound lactone) was 34 ± 8 ng/mL (n = 15)
after a 25 μg/h topotecan infusion but increased to 109 ±
42 ng/mL after administration of gefitinib (n = 15; P <
0.001). Figure 4A displays plasma unbound topotecan lactone concentration in all experiments in which gefitinib
was administered 14 hours after topotecan pump insertion.
In the TPT12-GEF group (n = 6), which received 200 mg/kg
gefitinib before pump insertion, we corrected the topotecan
dosage to 12.5 μg/h and achieved plasma exposure (Css,plasma,
33 ± 2 ng/mL) similar to that in animals receiving 25 μg/mL
without gefitinib.
We used the U87 model to characterize intratumor drug
distribution with the steady-state approach because these tumors are easily identified and dissected, grow faster and
more consistently, and have an ABC transporter expression
profile similar to that of MT330 tumors. We first performed
microdialysis experiments to define topotecan Css,tECF. After
a 25 μg/h topotecan infusion, the mean Css,tECF was 22 ± 10
ng/mL (n = 10); after administration of gefitinib (200 mg/kg),
the mean C ss,tECF increased to 30 ± 12 ng/mL (n = 10;
P = 0.019, paired t test). Figure 4B shows a representative
experiment in a single animal.
Microdialysis experiments were also performed in the
TPT12-GEF group, which received 12.5 μg/h topotecan after
200 mg/kg gefitinib. Css,tECF (6.4 ± 0.8 ng/mL, n = 3) was significantly lower than that in animals that had not received
gefitinib (P = 0.014, Mann-Whitney test).

When Ptumor (i.e., Css,tECF/Css,plasma ratio) was calculated,
we observed lower ratios in both groups of animals receiving
gefitinib than in the TPT25 group (without gefitinib;

topotecan lactone from the tECF and induced drug accumulation in the intracellular compartment, likely by inhibiting
ABC transporters in the tumor cells.
To test our hypothesis, we calculated the volume of
distribution of unbound drug in tumor (Vu,tumor) to describe
intratumor drug distribution in vivo. New studies in U87
tumor-bearing mice provided the total (bound + unbound)
topotecan lactone concentration at the steady-state in tumor
homogenates (Atot,tumor, 47 ± 21, 142 ± 67, and 43 ± 17 ng/mg
tumor) and blood (Ctot,blood, 105 ± 33, 219 ± 81, and 109 ± 8 ng/
mL) of the TPT25 (n = 8), TPT25-GEF (n = 7), and TPT12-GEF
(n = 6) groups, respectively. The mean unbound topotecan
tECF concentrations (Css,tECF) from the microdialysis experiments were then used to calculate V u,tumor . As shown in
Fig. 5A, Vu,tumor was significantly higher in groups receiving
gefitinib. Thus, after administration of gefitinib, a greater
proportion of drug was intracellular or nonspecifically bound
to tumor tissue components rather than as unbound drug in
the tECF.
To further characterize intracellular topotecan accumulation in the presence of gefitinib, we incubated U87 and
MT330 cells with topotecan (0.1 μmol/L) and gefitinib (1 or
10 μmol/L). Topotecan accumulation was enhanced as much
as 36% by gefitinib in both U87 and MT330 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5B). This finding supports the shift
of topotecan distribution toward the intracellular compartment in the presence of gefitinib.
Effect of gefitinib on tumor cell sensitivity to topotecan
To assess whether gefitinib sensitizes tumor cells to topotecan, we measured the growth of U87 and MT330 cells in
the presence of topotecan, topotecan plus gefitinib (1 or
10 μmol/L), and gefitinib alone (Fig. 6). Gefitinib alone
(0.001–50 μmol/L) did not substantially affect growth,
but the IC50 values of topotecan decreased in both cell lines
with the addition of 10 μmol/L gefitinib [U87: from 15.1
(12.3–17.8) μmol/L to 3.54 (2.73–4.34) μmol/L; MT330: from
4.81 (3.84–5.79) μmol/L to 3.27 (2.71–3.83) μmol/L; means
and 95% confidence intervals are provided].

Discussion
The ability of selected TKIs to enhance drug penetration of
tumors by inhibiting ABC transporters in vivo is not completely understood. Here, we used two glioma models—a cell
line (U87) and a primary culture (MT330)—to assess the effect of the TKI gefitinib on the tumor penetration and intratumor distribution of topotecan both in vitro and in
orthotopic xenografts in CD1 athymic nude mice. Our results
show that the pharmacologic interaction of the drugs results
in increased intracellular tumor exposure to topotecan. The
experimental model we used provides a novel method of
assessing the effect of a modulator of drug efflux on the
intratumor distribution of a chemotherapy agent in orthotopically engrafted brain tumors.
Our previous studies of topotecan-gefitinib and irinotecangefitinib combinations in transporter-overexpressing cells
(6, 14, 35) and in brain penetration analyses (11, 13) showed

that gefitinib inhibits at least two topotecan transporters:
BCRP and Pgp. The inhibition of these two transporters in
brain tumors could affect drug efflux at two levels: BBB vessels and tumor cells. We previously showed in an intact BBB

model that gefitinib enhances drug penetration of the BBB
(11, 13); in the present study, we focused on its effect at
the tumor cell level. Therefore, we selected tumor models
(U87 and MT330) that show increased vascular permeability
(altered BBB) and ABC transporter expression. The U87 tumor vasculature does express multidrug resistance proteins
like Pgp that may act as drug efflux pumps in intracerebral
tumor models (23, 40). However, our contrast MRI (Supplementary Fig. S1) and microdialysis (Fig. 2) results, which confirm the increased permeability of the U87 tumor vessels, call
into question the activity of this or other putative transporters at the tumor vessel level. At the cellular level, we found
abundant BCRP expression in U87 and MT330 lines, consistent with clinical findings in gliomas (41). Topotecan is also a
substrate of MRP4 (35) and likely of MRP1 (42), both of which
we found in U87 and MT330 tumor lines (Fig. 3). To our
knowledge, gefitinib inhibition of MRP4 and MRP1 has not
been studied in detail, although a similar compound, erlotinib, did not alter MRP1-related drug resistance (17). Therefore, the activity of MRP1 and MRP4 in our tumor lines
may at least partially explain their relatively high resistance
to topotecan even in the presence of gefitinib.
The steady-state experimental approach allowed us to
observe the real-time effects of gefitinib on the topotecan
tECF-to-plasma concentration ratio in individual animals.
The decrease in this ratio after gefitinib administration was

confirmed in a group of gefitinib-exposed animals (TPT12GEF) whose topotecan dose was reduced to achieve systemic
exposure equivalent to that achieved without gefitinib at a
higher dosage (25 μg/h; equivalent plasma exposure helped
to minimize the effect in which higher plasma levels can increase drug penetration of the intracellular compartment).
These observations prompted us to investigate whether inhibition of transporters at the tumor cell level would drive drug
distribution toward the tumor intracellular compartment.
Data from our in vivo studies of homogenate-microdialysis
concentration and from our in vitro studies of intracellular
accumulation supported this shift in topotecan intratumor
distribution. We did not evaluate intratumor gefitinib concentration, although good penetration was reported in subcutaneous glioma xenografts (gefitinib concentration >20
μmol/L for 8 h after a single oral dose of 55 mg/kg; ref.
43). In patients with gliomas who received gefitinib (500
mg, orally for 5 d) before tumor resection, gefitinib Css was
7 to 25 μmol/L in the tumor homogenate (44).
We attempted the steady-state experimental approach to
study the effect of gefitinib on topotecan CNS penetration in
nontumor-bearing mice. However, we did not obtain interpretable data from this experiment because the intact BBB
limited CNS drug penetration in a way that, with our bioanalytic system, we could not detect topotecan in the ECF dialysates collected before the administration of gefitinib.

Gefitinib Enhances Drug Penetration of Glioma Xenograft

Figure 6. Sensitivity of tumor cells to topotecan (100–0.001 μmol/L), gefitinib (50–0.05 μmol/L), and combinations of topotecan (100–0.001 μmol/L) and

A plausible reason for this limitation of the infusion approach
is that slow drug infusions penetrate the intact CNS less efficiently compared with rapid bolus injections likely because
the plasma concentration driving drug diffusion across the
BBB is much lower in the case of the infusions (45). Increasing
the infusion rate to achieve elevated plasma Css in the nontumor-bearing animals might have rendered detectable drug levels in the ECF, but the toxicity of topotecan at such increased
plasma Css precluded performing this study.
We suggest that microdialysis alone is only partially informative in brain tumor drug penetration studies because (a)
high drug concentrations in tECF would be expected, given
the usually altered BBB, and (b) only drugs in the tECF are
analyzed, whereas most chemotherapy agents have intracellular targets. Further, microdialysis measurement of drug
concentration in intracranial tumors is complex (40, 46,
47). Microdialysis was recently used elegantly to identify
very high methotrexate levels in the tECF of patients' highly
contrasting gliomas, but as mentioned above, these levels do
not reveal the tumor cell penetration of the drug (46). New
techniques like the one proposed by Langer and colleagues
(48), combining positron emission tomography and microdialysis, may overcome the limitations of microdialysis alone
and allow assessment of intracellular drug penetration in
unresected human tumors.
To conclude, ours is the first report characterizing the role
of drug efflux inhibitors in shifting the intratumor distribution
of substrate drugs toward the cellular compartment in an

orthotopic glioma model. Specific sampling and analysis
methods are necessary to assess the intratumor distribution
of anticancer drugs. Future studies to bring these concepts
into the preclinical and clinical fields are warranted. One
example is the use of irinotecan in combination with the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab for recurrent glioma (49). As
prolonged antiangiogenic therapy is reportedly associated
with restoration of the BBB (50), future studies should address
how the possible recovery of the BBB and inhibitors of drug
efflux affect the penetration of brain tumors by irinotecan.
