ABSTRACT
The over-expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays a crucial role
in the development, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. Therefore, neutralizing
antibodies against bFGF may inhibit the growth of lung cancer. In this study, a
Disulfide-stabilized diabody (ds-Diabody) against bFGF was constructed by sitedirected mutation and overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) at the position of VH44
and VL100 in the scFv. The ds-Diabody was constructed and expressed in Pichia
pastoris. We found that the ds-Diabody against bFGF could efficiently suppress
the proliferation, migration and invasion of human lung cancer A549 cells in vitro.
Moreover, in A549 cells, the ds-Diabody against bFGF could inhibit bFGF-induced
activation of downstream signaling regulators, such as phospho-Akt and phosphoMAPK. In the nude mouse xenograft model of lung cancer, the ds-Diabody against
bFGF could significantly inhibit tumor growth and decrease the densities of microvessels and lymphatic vessels in tumor tissue. Our data indicate that the ds-Diabody
against bFGF could effectively suppress the lung cancer growth through blockade of
bFGF signaling pathway and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, which may make it a
potential therapeutic candidate antibody drug for human lung cancer therapy.

melanoma in vivo and in vitro [12]. However, traditional
murine mAbs could induce human anti-mouse antibody
(HAMA) response and interfere with the therapeutic effect
[13–15]. It is very important to construct human antibodies
to avoid HAMA reaction. Tao has prepared a full-length
human antibody against bFGF, which could remarkably
inhibit the growth of melanoma in vitro and in vivo [16].
Small molecule antibodies get more and more attention
for its good tissue penetration and low immunogenicity.
They may have a potential application in target therapy of
human diseases [17]. Diabody is one of the small molecule
antibodies, which is a non-covalently associated bivalent
molecule, created from scFv by shortening the polypeptide
linker between the VH and VL domains [18]. The diabody
was non-covalently associated and the linker may interfere
with the antigen binding, which may result in lower affinity
and unstable [19]. Introduction of disulphide bond in the
framework of VH and VL domains could stabilize the
diabody and keep the affinity [17, 20–22].

INTRODUCTION
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a pleiotropic
growth factor. One of the most important functions of
bFGF is to promote endothelial cell proliferation and
promote angiogenesis by the physical organization of
endothelial cells into tube-like structures [1–3]. bFGF is
overexpressed in malignant tumors [4–7]. The binding of
bFGF and its receptor (FGFR) may activate the signaling
pathways of MAPKs/ERKs and PI3K/AKT, which is
correlated with tumor growth, migration, angiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis [4, 5]. Therefore, blocking bFGF/
FGFR activity with antibodies might be a good therapeutic
strategy for tumor patients [8].
The anti-bFGF murine monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) have been reported to have anti-tumor effect
on chondrosarcoma, glioma, Lewis lung carcinoma and
melanoma [9–12]. Li proved that traditional anti-bFGF
murine mAbs display remarkable anti-tumor effect on B16

In this study, we mainly reported the construction
of ds-Diabody and the inhibition effect and the potential
mechanisms of the human disulfide-stabilized diabody
against bFGF on the growth of human lung cancer A549
cells in vitro and in vivo.

The ds-Diabody against bFGF was secretion
expressed in the supernatant of recombinant yeast and
purified by Ni SepharoseTM 6 affinity chromatography
and anion-exchange chromatography. The high purity of
recombinant ds-Diabody against bFGF was obtained and
the purity of it is above 95% (Figure 2a).

RESULTS

Antigen binding activity of the ds-Diabody
against bFGF

Expression and purification of the ds-Diabody
against bFGF

The antigen binding activity of the ds-Diabody
against bFGF was analyzed by indirect ELISA. When
the concentration of the antibodies was 0.332 μg/mL, the
value of OD450 nm of the ds-Diabody could reached about
1.0, while the value of OD450 nm of the full-length human
antibody was just under 0.1. The results showed that the
ds-Diabody against bFGF could specifically bind to bFGF
and the formation of disulphide bonds in the ds-Diabody
did not influence its antigen binding activity (Figure 3).

The high affinity human antibodies of scFv against
bFGF were selected from a phage display library [16].
The human disulfide-stabilized diabody against bFGF (dsDiabody) gene fragment was constructed by site-directed
mutation and overlap extension (SOE-PCR) at the VH44
and VL100 position of the scFv (Figure 1). The ds- Diabody
gene fragment was constructed into the yeast expression
vector pPICZαA and the recombinant plasmid pPICZαA-dsDiabody was transformed into Pichia pasporis strain GS115.
The ds-Diabody against bFGF could be high level expressed
in yeast. The yield of recombinant ds-Diabody against
bFGF could reach 30-50 mg/L in cell culture. The result of
western-blot showed that the ds-Diabody against bFGF was
specific appeared at the molecular weight of approximately
35 kDa under reducing condition and 70 kDa under nonreducing condition (Figure 2b).

Proliferation inhibition of A549 cells by the
ds-Diabody against bFGF
The proliferation inhibition assay of A549 cells
was conducted by CCK-8 kit. The results of cell
proliferation inhibition assay showed that the cell
viability was decreased with the increasing of the ds-

Diaboy against bFGF. When the concentration of the
ds-Diabody was 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL, the
cell proliferation inhibition rate was about 19.23%,
28.59%, 31.88%, 37.35 % and 40.94% respectively.
The results indicated that the ds-Diaboy could inhibit
the proliferation of human lung cancer A549 cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 4). The positive control
of full-length human IgG against bFGF showed similarly
inhibitory effect on the proliferation of A549 cells
and the irrelevant IgG showed no inhibitory effect
(Figure 4).

The starved A549 cells were treated with different
concentrations of ds-Diabody together with bFGF. The
cells were lysed and the proteins in the lysates was
separated with SDS-PAGE and assayed with western-blot.
The western-blot results showed that the phosphorylation
of Akt and MAPK could be activated by bFGF in A549
cells, and the ds-Diabody agasint bFGF could effectively
block the phosphorylation activation of Akt and MAPK in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5). The results revealed

The tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
were assessed by immunohistochemical staining with antiCD31 and anti-LYVE1 antibodies. The average number
of microvessels was about 41.0 in the group of the dsDiabody against bFGF and 63.0 in the group of PBS. The
average number of lymphatic vessels was about 4.0 in the
group of the ds-Diabody against bFGF and 13.0 in the

DISCUSSION

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines
in Jinan University.

In our previous study, high affinity human antibodies
of scFv against bFGF were selected from a phage display
library, and the full-length human antibody against bFGF
was reconstructed [16]. The full-length human antibody
against bFGF could significantly inhibit the growth of
melanoma [16]. Diabody is one of the smallest of bivalent
antibody with approximately one-third the molecular
weight of full-length antibody molecules, which may
improve its penetration into tumor tissue [17]. In order
to increase the stability of the Diabody, we constructed
a human disulfide-stabilized Diabody against bFGF by
introducing the disulphide bonds between the VH and VL
domain by site directed mutation. The result of indirect
ELISA indicated that the introducing of disulphide bonds
in the variable region of diabody did not affect its antigen
binding activity.
In this study, the ds-Diabody against bFGF could
significantly suppress the tumor growth in nude mice and
the inhibition rate could reach about 86.54%. Compared
with the full-length human antibody against bFGF, the
ds-Diabody against bFGF showed a stronger inhibitory
effect on the growth of tumor, possibly because the dsDiabody agasint bFGF has a stronger penetration with low
molecular weight.
The signaling pathways of MAPK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT are the main pathways that involved in the
proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cell [24].
Blockade of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway by antibFGF antibody could result in suppressing of invasion
and migration triggered by bFGF [25]. We found that the
ds-Diabody against bFGF could effectively inhibit the
proliferation, migration and invasion of the A549 cells by
blocking the signal pathway of Akt and MAPK.
In this study, we have preliminarily explored the
inhibitory effect of the human ds-diabody against bFGF on
the growth of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. The results
indicated that the ds-Diabody could effectively neutralize
the paracrine and autocrine bFGF in tumors and block the
signaling pathways of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT and
inhibit the tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

Expression and purification of the ds-Diabody
against bFGF
In our previous study, high affinity human
antibodies of scFv against bFGF were selected from a
phage display library [16]. The ds-Diabody against bFGF
was constructed by site-directed mutation and overlap
extension (SOE-PCR) at the position of VH44 and VL100
in the scFv. Tao has prepared a full-length human antibody
against bFGF which was used as a positive control in our
study [16].
The recombinant plasmid pPICZαA-ds-Diabody
was transformed into Pichia pasporis strain GS115. The
ds-Diabody against bFGF was obtained by the induction
culture of the recombinant yeast transformants. The dsDiabody against bFGF was purified from the expression
supernatant by affinity chromatography and anionexchange chromatography [26]. The target protein was
assayed by SDS-PAGE and western-blot.

Antigen binding activity of the ds-Diabody
against bFGF
The 96-well plates were coated with bFGF (50 ng/
well, R&D Systems) at 4°C overnight and blocked with
5% non-fat milk. The purified ds-Diabody against bFGF
was diluted serially and added into the 96-well plates
and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed
3 times with PBST (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) and the anti-His tag
monoclonal antibody (1: 5000 dilution) was added and
incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG was added and incubated for 30 min
at 37°C. The plates were then stained with DAB (Sigma)
and the absorbance values at 450 nm (A450) values were
immediately measured in an ELISA reader.

Cell proliferation assay
A549 cells were transferred in 96-well plates at
a density of 2000 cells/well and incubated overnight at
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After starved cultivation in
DMEM with 0.5% FBS for 12 h, cells were treated with
serially diluted ds-Diabody against bFGF (6.25-100 μg/
mL), together with 15 ng/mL bFGF for 48 h. The control
groups were treated with the full-length human IgG
against bFGF or the irrelevant IgG. The number of viable
cells was finally determined by Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK8) reagent. According to the manufacturer’s protocol, 10
μL CCK-8 was quickly added to each well and incubated
with cells for 2 h. After incubation, the absorbance at 450
nm was immediately measured in an ELISA reader. The
cell proliferation inhibition rate was calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and animals
Human lung cancer cells (A549) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) plus 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All the cells were
cultured in an incubator with 95% humidity and 5% CO2
at 37°C.
BALB/c nude mice (female, 6–8 weeks) were
purchased from Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yat-Sen
University, Guangzhou, China. All the animals used in the
experiments were treated humanely in accordance with

Western blot assay

The lower chambers were DMEM with 10% FBS. At the
end of the treatment, cells on the upper side of the filters
were mechanically removed, and those migrated onto the
lower side were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained by 0.1%
crystal violet (Meryer) and imaged with a computerized
imaging system.

The A549 cells (2×105 cells/well) were transferred
in 6-well plates and serum-starved cultured in DMEM
with 0.5 % FBS overnight. The cells were exchanged
with the medium of DMEM with 15 ng/mL bFGF and
0.5 % FBS and serially concentrations of the ds-Diabody
and incubated for 30 min. The cells were washed with
cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. The lysates were
centrifuged at 12000 g for 6 min at 4°C and the total
proteins in the supernatant were quantified by BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). The proteins were separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat
milk at 37°C for 1 h. After washing 3 times with PBST,
phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt were detected by
rabbit anti p-MAPK (cell signaling #4370) and rabbit
anti p-Akt (cell signaling #4060) antibodies, respectively.
Total MAPK and Akt were detected by rabbit anti-MAPK
(cell signaling #4695) and rabbit anti-Akt (cell signaling
#4691) antibodies, respectively. The membrane was
incubated with the primary antibody at 4°C overnight.
After washing, the membrane was then incubated with
the HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1h at 37°C.
The blots were then detected with an ECL detection kit
(Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
anti-β-actin antibody (cell signaling, #4970) was used as
the reference control.

Tumor model
Human lung cancer A549 cells (1×106 cells in 100
μl) were subcutaneously injected into the right shoulder
flank of BALB/c nude mice (15-20 g, n = 6). When
palpable tumors (≥5 mm in diameter) developed, the
tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with
10 mg/kg ds-Diabody against bFGF or the full-length
human antibody against bFGF or PBS six times at 3
days intervals. Tumor size was measured every 3 days
in two dimensions using a vernier caliper. Mice were
euthanized 24 hours later after the last administration.
The tumors were stripped for immunohistochemistry
and weighed to calculate the tumor growth inhibition
rate. Tumor volume (mm3) was calculated as V = 1/2(a
× b2). a = tumor length, b = tumor width; Tumor growth
inhibition rate =(1 - the average tumor weight of treated
groups / the average tumor weight of PBS group)×
100%.

Evaluation of microvessel density and lymphatic
vessels density in subcutaneous tumors

Scratch assay

Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded in paraffin, and cut at 5 μm. After
deparaffinization, the sections were heat for 10 min at
100°C in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) for
antigen retrieval and treated with 3% H2O2 for 15 min
at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. The sections were blocked in 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h and incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (rabbit anti-CD31
polyclonal antibodies and rabbit Anti-LYVE1 polyclonal
antibody, Abcam). The sections were then incubated
with secondary antibody of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
polyclonal antibody and avidin-HRP for 1 h. The sections
were stained with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and
hematoxylin. The vessels density was determined by
counting the number of microvessels and lymphatic
vessels in five random high-power fields within the
sections, as described [12].

The effect of the ds-Diabody against bFGF on
migration of A549 cells was evaluated by scratch assay.
A549 cells (5×105 cells/well) suspended in DMEM
complete medium were transferred in 6-well plates.
After incubated for 24 h, a scratch treatment was taken.
After washing with serum-free DMEM, the DMEM
with 0.5% FBS and ds-Diabody against bFGF (100 μg/
mL) was added to the wells. The controls were the fulllength human IgG against bFGF (100 μg/mL) and the
irrelevant IgG (100 μg/mL) and the medium only. After
incubated for 0, 12 and 24 h, the plates were imaged with
a computerized imaging system. The cell migration rate of
each group was calculated.

Invasion assay
The effect of the ds-Diabody against bFGF on
invasion of A549 cells was assayed in transwell chambers.
The upper side of the filters was coated with 45 μl matrigel
matrix (BD) diluted (1:3) with serum-free DMEM. After
serum-starved for 12 h, A549 cells were seeded (5×104
cells/well) onto the layer of Matrigel using serum-free
medium, then stimulated with 15 ng/mL bFGF and 100 μg/
mL ds-Diabody against bFGF for 16 h. The control groups
were the full-length human IgG against bFGF (100 μg/
mL), the irrelevant IgG (100 μg/mL) and the medium only.
