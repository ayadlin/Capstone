Approximately 15% of lung cancer cases are of the small cell subtype, but this variant is highly aggressive and is often diagnosed at
advanced stages. Outcomes after current treatment regimens have been poor, with 5-year survival rates as low as 25% for patients
with limited-stage disease. Advances in therapy for small cell lung cancer have included the development of more effective chemotherapeutic agents and radiation techniques. For example, hyperfractionated radiotherapy given early in the course of the disease
can reduce local recurrence and extend survival. Other technologic advances in radiation planning and delivery such as intensitymodulated radiotherapy, image-guided adaptive radiotherapy, and 4-dimensional computed tomography/positron emission tomography have facilitated the design of treatment volumes that closely conform to the shape of the tumor, which allows higher radiation
doses to be given while minimizing radiation-induced toxicity to adjacent structures. Future improvements in outcomes will require

INTRODUCTION
More than 1.6 million new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed worldwide in 2008, with an estimated 1,378,400 deaths
occurring from the disease.1 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (> 95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including
SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend
took nearly 20 years to become evident among men.2 Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also
increased by approximately 5% since the advent of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early
lung cancer.3 The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking
cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of
prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those patients who experience a complete response to therapy.4
SCLC typically presents in patients aged  70 years with a history of heavy tobacco smoking. The disease often
presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common. Extrathoracic spread (ie, extensive-stage
disease) is also quite common, being present in 75% to 80% of cases at diagnosis.5 Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; approximately 50% of these metastases are symptomatic and the other 50% are
detected by imaging.6 The rate of brain metastases increases among patients who survive for at least 2 years after diagnosis.7 Given the highly aggressive nature of SCLC, 5-year OS rates are only approximately 25% for patients with limitedstage SCLC (disease confined to 1 hemithorax and regional lymph nodes).8,9 Predictors of poor prognosis include poor
performance status, older age, and being male.10 The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis.11
Disease Staging

Although a tumor-lymph node-metastasis (TNM) classification has been proposed for staging patients with SCLC,12,13
many institutions continue to use a simplified 2-stage system developed by the Veterans Administration Lung Cancer
Study Group that categorizes disease as either being of limited stage or extensive stage.14 Current guidelines of the US
National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET) and CT scanning,

or fused PET/CT scanning, of the chest, liver, adrenals,
bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of patients with SCLC. In 1 small study comparing
the use of CT versus PET/CT for disease staging in 51
patients with SCLC, PET/CT was found to detect all 51
primary lung cancers that had been observed on CT.
However, PET/CT scanning led to changes in the
assigned disease stage for 8 patients, with 2 of 18 cases
originally diagnosed as limited-stage cancer being reclassified as extensive disease and 6 of 33 cases of extensive disease being reclassified as limited-stage disease.15
Several histologic and immunohistochemical
markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring
treatment response in patients with SCLC, including
transcription thyroid factor-1 (found to be positive
in > 85% of cases of SCLC), cytokeratin 7, deletions in
chromosome 3, Leu-7, chromogranin A, synaptophysin,
myc amplification, and p53 mutations (which are present
in approximately 75% of cases).16 Deletions of tumor
suppressor genes are also relatively common and include
fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80% of cases), RAS effector
homologue (RASSF1) (> 90% of cases), TP53 (> 75% of
cases), retinoblastoma-1 (RB1) (> 90% of cases), and retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARb) (72% of cases).17,18
However, to our knowledge, no biomarkers to date have
been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover,
mutations that are often present in non-small cell lung
cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]
mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are
rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have
been linked with worse prognosis, such as poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the
presence of paraneoplastic syndromes.19
Recognizing and Managing Paraneoplastic
Syndromes

Paraneoplastic syndromes are fairly common in patients
with SCLC, with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) appearing in up to
15% of cases, Cushing or adrenocorticotropic hormone
production syndrome in 2% to 5% of cases, and
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in 3% of
cases.18,20 SIADH is the most common paraneoplastic
disorder associated with SCLC. Indeed, among patients
with SIADH, SCLC is an incidental finding in nearly
50% of cases.21 A review of 244 patients with limitedstage SCLC who were treated between 1981 and 1998
demonstrated that 14 patients (6%) had SIADH at the
time of presentation, with symptoms including weakCancer

ness, altered consciousness, seizures, and low overall sodium levels (110-129 milliequivalent [mEq]/L).22
Moreover, 10 of these 14 patients who originally presented with SIADH were found to have recurrent
SIADH when the SCLC recurred, suggesting that serum
sodium levels may be a useful marker in posttreatment
surveillance for tumor recurrence. Another group found
that both initial hyponatremia (P < .001) and an inability to normalize sodium levels during chemotherapy
(P 5 .027) were poor prognostic indicators for OS.23
They also found an increased percentage of metastatic
disease at the time of presentation among those who
presented with low serum sodium levels. The usefulness
of hyponatremia as a prognostic indicator has also been
supported by other studies.24,25
Rare cases have been reported of patients presenting
with paraneoplastic complications such as gastroparesis
and pseudoachalasia.26,27 These symptoms resolved with
the treatment of SCLC. Interestingly, antinuclear antibodies such as type 1 antineuronal nuclear antibody
(ANNA-1, also known as anti-Hu) have been found in
some cases of gastrointestinal dysmotility secondary to
paraneoplastic disease.28,29 SCLC has also been associated
with combined antidiuretic hormone secretion and ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production.30
Another paraneoplastic disorder called oncogenic osteomalacia, a rare bone disorder presenting with increased renal phosphate excretion, has been identified in several
cases of SCLC.31 Guillain-Barre syndrome, although
more often present in association with other cancers, was
identified as a paraneoplastic syndrome in a patient with
SCLC.32 Finally, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,
which occurs in only 1% to 3% of patients with SCLC,
strongly correlates with underlying cancer, because nearly
50% of patients who present with this syndrome are
found incidentally to have SCLC.33,34 Hence the presence
of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome should prompt
screening for SCLC.34 Treatment for paraneoplastic syndromes usually includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities and symptom management, but these generally
resolve when the cancer is treated.
Early Thoracic Radiotherapy

Surgery currently has little role in the treatment of
patients with SCLC unless it is diagnosed quite early. The
superiority of radiotherapy over surgery was established
several decades ago by a study by the British Medical
Research Council (median OS of 9.9 months for patients
treated with radiation vs 6.5 months for those treated with
surgery),35,36 and radiotherapy has been the standard
791

Review Article

treatment for patients with limited-stage SCLC since that
time. The next series of studies investigated more effective
chemotherapy strategies for limited-stage SCLC.
Although several large studies have demonstrated substantial improvements with the use of etoposide-containing
regimens and cisplatin,37,38 the optimal combination of
radiotherapy and chemotherapy has yet to be defined.
Ongoing studies are analyzing various combination regimens for their ability to control tumors while minimizing
toxicity.
The combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for limited-stage disease is well supported by 2 metaanalyses.39,40 One meta-analysis, reported by Pignon
et al,39 reviewed 2140 patients from 13 trials and found
an improvement in the 3-year OS rate for those treated
with chemoradiation (14.3%) versus those treated with
chemotherapy alone (8.9%). In the other meta-analysis,
Warde and Payne40 combined data from 11 randomized
trials with or without chemoradiation and found that the
receipt of chemoradiation led to better 2-year intrathoracic tumor control rates than did chemotherapy alone
(34.1% vs 16.5%). The 2-year OS rates were also 5.4%
higher in the patients treated with chemoradiation
(P < .05). Further fine-tuning of the treatment approach
with altered fractionation and perhaps targeted agents
could further improve survival rates.
In terms of the optimal timing of thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy, several large studies have
shown that concurrent chemotherapy, or radiotherapy
initiated early in the course of the chemotherapy, produces better disease control than chemotherapy followed
sequentially by radiotherapy.41-43 Murray et al42 studied
patients treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
and vincristine, alternating with etoposide and cisplatin,
and beginning thoracic radiotherapy either on week 3
or on week 15. Patients who achieved a complete
response to this therapy also received PCI. Patients who
received radiation early during chemotherapy had significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) (P 5 .036),
OS (P 5 .008), and freedom from brain metastases
(P 5 .006) (Fig. 1).42 JCOG 9104, a phase 3 trial by
the Japan Clinical Oncology Group,41 compared concurrent chemoradiation with sequential chemotherapy
followed by radiotherapy for patients with limited-stage
SCLC. All patients received cisplatin and etoposide.
Patients who received concurrent chemoradiation
seemed to have better 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS
rates than did patients receiving sequential treatment (2year OS rate of 54.4% vs 35.1%; 3-year OS rate of
29.8% vs 20.2%; and 5-year OS rate of 23.7% vs
792

18.3%), but these apparent differences were not statistically significant (P 5 .097). Further support for initiating thoracic radiotherapy early for limited-stage SCLC
was demonstrated by another meta-analysis of trials
conducted from 1985 through 2002,44 which demonstrated a small but significant improvement in 2-year
OS from early radiotherapy that was more evident
among those receiving hyperfractionated regimens and
platinum-based chemotherapy. A more recent metaanalysis45 of 7 randomized trials evaluating when to initiate radiotherapy relative to platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated that radiotherapy that is initiated
within 30 days of the start of chemotherapy produced
better 2-year and 5-year survival rates than radiotherapy
initiated > 30 days after chemotherapy (hazard ratio,
0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.93 [P 5 .02]).
The inferiority of sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with concurrent chemoradiation
most likely reflects the development of chemoresistant
clones, which often become resistant to radiation and
lead to tumor repopulation.
Hyperfractionated and Accelerated Thoracic
Radiotherapy

Concurrent chemoradiation therapy has become the
standard of care for patients with SCLC, at least for those
who can tolerate the therapy.19 The next advancements in

cancer.49

treatment came from considering the potential benefits of
hyperfractionated radiotherapy on tumor control. The
finding that local tumor control rates remain less than
optimal at 30% to 50% suggested that increasing the radiation dose, either by escalation, hyperfractionation, or a
combination of the 2, might improve outcomes. Several
studies have been done to evaluate the effectiveness of
higher-dose radiation for limited-stage SCLC.46-48 One
such study by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG 9712) sought to establish the maximum tolerated
dose of thoracic radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin
and etoposide for patients with limited-stage disease.48
Radiation was initially given in once-daily fractions of 1.8
gray (Gy) per fraction and subsequently increased to
twice-daily fractions such that the maximum doses were
50.4 Gy, 54.0 Gy, 57.6 Gy, 61.2 Gy, and 64.8 Gy. The
maximum tolerated dose in that study was 61.2 Gy. At 18
months, the median OS rate for those receiving 61.2 Gy
was 82% compared with 25% for patients treated with
50.4 Gy.
The propensity of SCLC for tumor repopulation
and resistance has prompted intense study of hyperfractionated accelerated chemoradiation. Intergroup (INT)
0096 trial (also known as RTOG 8815) demonstrated significant benefit from hyperfractionated radiotherapy, specifically comparing the standard dose of 45 Gy given in
once-daily fractionation over 5 weeks to a dose of 45 Gy
given twice daily over 3 weeks.49 Patients given the hyperfractionated regimen had significantly better 5-year OS
rates (26% vs 16%; P 5 .04) (Fig. 2)49; however, the
twice-daily regimen was associated with high rates of
toxicity (grade 3 esophagitis). Notably, at approximately

60 Gy, the biologically effective dose (BED) of the twicedaily regimen was considerably higher than the BED of
the once-daily dose to 45 Gy used in that trial, a dose that
is now considered below the current standard. A metaanalysis of individual patient data published in 2012 also
suggested that accelerated or hyperfractionated radiotherapy may have been beneficial in terms of OS, but this
potential benefit again came at the cost of higher rates of
acute esophagitis (odds ratio, 2.41; P < .001).50 However,
that meta-analysis included patients who were treated
since 1970, and thus the older, less conformal radiation
techniques in use at that time may have accounted for the
high rates of toxicity. Another more recent study, RTOG
0239, was a phase 2 trial of accelerated high-dose thoracic
radiotherapy to 61.2 Gy given over 5 weeks (16 oncedaily fractions of 1.8 Gy followed by 18 twice-daily fractions of 1.8 Gy) given with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide.51 The 2-year local control rate of 80% was much
better than the rate of 64% reported in the INT 0096
trial, supporting the use of accelerated hyperfractionation
to achieve a high BED (Fig. 3)51; however, rates of severe
acute esophagitis (18%) and myelosuppression (90%)
underscore the need to remain cognizant of the toxicity of
this regimen. Nevertheless, at 2.8%, the treatment-related
death rate was similar to that of other chemoradiation regimens. This treatment regimen was initially included in
the ongoing phase 3 RTOG 0538 trial, in which outcomes among patients randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups
are compared (45 Gy in 30 fractions twice daily, 70 Gy in
35 fractions once daily, and 61.2 Gy in 34 fractions given

first once daily and later twice daily [the RTOG 0239 regimen]) (Fig. 4). However, the RTOG 0239 treatment
arm was closed recently when higher treatment-related
toxicity was noted on an interim analysis. A similar European collaborative phase 3 trial (CONVERT) is also
ongoing. At this time, the current standard of care
remains 45 Gy, given in 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily.
Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation

Brain metastases are common in patients with SCLC,
developing in > 50% of patients within 2 years of diagnosis and in up to 60% of patients within 5 years.52,53
Chemotherapy is largely ineffective in preventing or treating brain metastases because of the presence of the bloodbrain barrier. However, PCI has shown some ability to
prevent or control brain metastases in some patients with
SCLC, predominantly those with limited-stage disease
that responds completely to chemoradiation.
In 1993, Rosen et al54 suggested that the receipt of
PCI improved survival in patients who demonstrated a
complete response to treatment. These findings led to
PCI being offered routinely to patients who achieved a
complete response to the treatment of limited-stage disease. A large meta-analysis of data from 7 trials indicated
that patients who received PCI had a lower incidence of
brain metastasis at 3 years after treatment (33% vs 59%)
and a higher 3-year OS rate (20.7% vs 15.3%).55 A large
randomized phase 3 study with 720 patients was undertaken to define the optimal dose of PCI; in that study,
794

patients were to receive 25 Gy in 2.5-Gy once-daily fractions, 36 Gy in 2-Gy once-daily fractions, or 36 Gy in
1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions.56 Receipt of 36 Gy did not
substantially reduce the 2-year rate of brain metastasis
when compared with the 25-Gy dose (23% vs 29%;
P 5 .18), and the higher dose was associated with more
severe toxicity and a worse 2-year OS rate (37% vs 43%;
P 5 .05). A follow-up analysis of quality of life revealed
communication deficits, leg weakness, intellectual deficits, and memory problems to be more common in those
patients treated with the higher dose (P < .005).57 The
findings from this study support the use of a dose of 25
Gy in 10 fractions, which continues to be the standard
dose used at this time. Studies have also supported the use
of PCI for patients with extensive SCLC that responded
to chemotherapy, demonstrating overall improvements in
survival and disease-free progression.58
To the best of our knowledge, the potential benefit
of PCI for patients who achieve only a partial or incomplete response to chemoradiation has not been well studied. One recent attempt to address this issue by reviewing
patients with limited-stage SCLC who were treated
between 1981 and 2007 found some benefit from PCI in
reducing the rate of brain metastases (6.1% vs 27.6%;
P 5 .05) and delaying their onset (time to symptom onset
of 20.7 months vs 10.6 months; P < .0001) in patients
with an incomplete response to therapy.59 However, no
benefit was found with regard to OS (P 5 .32).59 The
authors of this report suggested that some clinical predictors may be useful for identifying a subgroup of incomplete responders who may benefit from PCI. This issue
will require further study to identify and validate clinical
or biological markers for this purpose. Current guidelines
support the use of PCI for patients with limited-stage
SCLC who experience a complete response to therapy,9
with some additional evidence supporting the use of PCI
for patients who demonstrate any response.60
Future Directions

The use of modern techniques for radiation planning and
delivery such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy can
greatly improve outcomes in patients with limited-stage
SCLC because such techniques provide highly conformal
radiation doses, offering the possibility of dose escalation
to tumors while minimizing treatment-related toxicity
resulting from inadvertent irradiation of surrounding normal tissues. Indeed, a group at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston recently
reported that intensity-modulated radiotherapy produced
equivalent oncologic outcomes and reduced the need for

feeding tube placement compared with 3-dimensional
conformal techniques for patients undergoing radiotherapy for limited-stage SCLC.61 The incorporation of
image-guided adaptive radiotherapy further improves the
accuracy of delivery by allowing treatment volumes to be
modified based on tumor response during treatment.62
The use of innovative radiation delivery techniques such
as these, and possibly proton therapy as well,63,64 in combination with modifying fractionation schedules (daily
fractions vs hyperfractionated treatment) to deliver the
maximum BED while minimizing toxicity should help to
establish the optimal treatment for patients with SCLC
that will translate into better local control.
Tailoring the radiation treatment to better address
the biological characteristics of SCLC, specifically accelerated proliferation, is an important area of research. Ways
of maximizing the BED while respecting dose limitations
to nearby critical normal organs are actively being sought.
In 1 retrospective review, patients who had received doses
exceeding a BED of 57 Gy had better local control
(P 5 .024), PFS (P 5 .006), and OS (P 5 .005) than
those who received a BED < 57 Gy.65 As described previously, several studies have found that shortening the duration of radiation and effectively maintaining or increasing
the BED may improve outcomes. Modern trials are using
this concept to evaluate various radiation doses and fraction sizes to achieve the optimal response. The INT 0096
trial initially established that accelerated fractionation was
beneficial over the original once-daily fractionation in
terms of 5-year OS rates.49 More recently, the RTOG
0239 trial incorporated updated radiation techniques to
deliver doses in once-daily fractionation followed by a
hyperfractionated boost, both with concurrent chemotherapy.51,66 Although the higher dose led to better tumor
response rates, it was also associated with myelosuppression.
The advent of PET/CT has greatly improved the
ability to identify the extent of tumor and lymph node
involvement in patients with lung cancer.67,68 The use of
PET to evaluate tumor response before and after initial
cycles of chemotherapy has raised the question of whether
radiation volumes should include preinduction or postinduction chemotherapy fields. This question is being
addressed in a prospective randomized trial in which all
patients receive 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by either concurrent chemoradiation using prechemotherapy volumes or concurrent chemoradiation using
postchemotherapy volumes.69 Interim results have indicated no difference in local recurrence rates between the
postchemotherapy and prechemotherapy groups (31.6%
vs 28.6%; P 5 .81).
Cancer

March 15, 2014

Progress in developing more effective chemotherapy
agents has been slow. To the best of our knowledge, newer
agents for use with platinum-based chemotherapy have
produced only minimal improvements to date. For example, maintenance therapy with vandetanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
did not seem to improve OS or PFS compared with a placebo.70 A phase 1 study evaluating topotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor previously used as second-line therapy for
SCLC, with paclitaxel in an attempt to enhance the cytotoxicity of induction therapy before chemoradiation demonstrated some promise.71 Research to clarify the
molecular architecture of SCLC and its resistance to treatment may lead to the discovery of additional, more effectively targeted agents. One example of this approach led
to the identification of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
(PARP1), a DNA repair protein, as a potential therapeutic
target. Proteomic profiling revealed high PARP1 levels in
SCLC tumors and cell lines, and PARP1 inhibition, both
as single-agent therapy and in combination with chemotherapy, has had some antitumor activity in preclinical
models of SCLC.72 Based on these results, several PARP
inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials for SCLC,
including 1 study (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
E2511 trial) in which the addition of the PARP1 inhibitor
veliparib (ABT-888) to chemoradiation is being investigated in patients with limited-stage SCLC.
Additional studies are currently underway to identify agents to treat disease recurrence. To the best of our
knowledge, single-agent topotecan is currently the only
drug used for second-line therapy for patients who do not
respond to or who experience disease recurrence after the
initial treatment.73 Several studies have investigated
second-line treatment with agents such as imatinib, bevacizumab, and thalidomide, all with minimal success.74-76
In addition to the studies of PARP inhibitors mentioned
above, other research in targeted therapy has focused on
apoptotic pathways of tumor cells. For example, inhibiting Bcl-2, a mediator of tumor cell apoptosis, may
increase SCLC sensitivity to chemotherapy and thus be a
fruitful target for further development.77,78 Other potential therapeutic targets that have emerged from more
recent profiling efforts include aurora kinase (especially in
myc-amplified tumors), SOX2 amplifications, rearranged
L-myc fusion (RLF)-MYCL1 fusions, and EZH2
(enhancer of zeste homolog 2 [Drosophila]).72,79,80

disease. Concurrent chemoradiation remains the standard
first-line therapy for patients with limited-stage SCLC,
with PCI offered to those whose disease responds to treatment. The use of cisplatin and etoposide are fundamental
to the improvements reported in OS rates. The addition
of early, accelerated radiotherapy has also led to improved
local control and OS. Further advances in technology will
no doubt result in further innovations in radiation delivery techniques such that the maximum treatment effects
are obtained with minimal damage to surrounding
organs. The research and development of molecularly targeted agents will likely lead to a new generation of treatments for SCLC, as is already occurring in the treatment
of other types of cancer.
