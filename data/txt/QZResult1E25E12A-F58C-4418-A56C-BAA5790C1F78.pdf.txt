Abstract
Telomeres are elongated by the enzyme telomerase, which
contains a template-bearing RNA (TER or TERC) and a protein
reverse transcriptase. Overexpression of a particular mutant
human TER with a mutated template sequence (MT-hTer-47A)
in telomerase-positive cancer cells causes incorporation of
mutant telomeric sequences, telomere uncapping, and initiation of a DNA damage response, ultimately resulting in cell
growth inhibition and apoptosis. The DNA damage pathways
underlying these cellular effects are not well understood.
Here, we show that the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
protein is activated and forms telomeric foci in response to
MT-hTer-47A expression. Depletion of ATM from two cancer
cell lines, including the p53-mutant UM-UC-3 bladder cancer
line, rendered the cells largely unresponsive to MT-hTer-47A.
Relative to ATM-competent controls, ATM-depleted cells
showed increased proliferation and clonogenic survival and
reduced cell death following MT-hTer-47A treatment. In contrast, ATM depletion sensitized the cancer cells to treatment
with camptothecin, a topoisomerase inhibitor that induces
DNA double-strand breaks. We show that the effects of ATM
depletion on the MT-hTer-47A response were not due to
decreased expression of MT-hTer-47A or reduced activity of
telomerase at the telomere. Instead, ATM depletion allowed
robust cancer cell growth despite the continued presence of
dysfunctional telomeres containing mutant sequence. Notably,
the number of end-to-end telomere fusions induced by MThTer-47A treatment was markedly reduced in ATM-depleted
cells. Our results identify ATM as a key mediator of the
MT-hTer-47A dysfunctional telomere response, even in cells
lacking wild-type p53, and provide evidence that telomere
fusions contribute to MT-hTer-47A cytotoxicity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect the integrity
of the chromosome ends (1). Telomeres consist of multiple tandem
repeats of a short DNA sequence—TTAGGG in humans—that
specifically bind a variety of proteins. The complexes composed of
these proteins, which in mammals have been termed shelterin,
prevent the chromosome ends from being treated as DNA breaks
and undergoing inappropriate repair processes (2). Each time a cell
divides, the telomeric DNA shortens slightly due to the inability of
the DNA replication apparatus to completely copy the ends of the

telomeres (3). Once a certain critical length is reached, shelterin
complexes are no longer effective in preventing the chromosome
ends from initiating a DNA damage response, ultimately leading
to cellular senescence or apoptosis (4, 5).
The enzyme telomerase, which is minimally composed of a
protein reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and a template-containing
RNA (hTER), counteracts telomere shortening by adding new
TTAGGG repeats to the 3¶ ends of the chromosomes (1). Thus,
telomerase is capable of circumventing the limit on cell division
imposed by telomere attrition. Telomerase activity is downregulated in most adult human cells, but it is readily detectable
in stem and progenitor cell populations as well as in the large
majority (f80–90%) of cancer cells (6). The telomerase activity in
these cell types underlies their ability to divide repeatedly without
reaching replicative senescence or undergoing apoptosis. Telomerase is therefore a key factor in the progression and maintenance of most tumors.
Given the high level of telomerase expression in most cancer
cells and the greatly diminished levels in the vast majority of adult
human cells, telomerase is an attractive target for cancer therapy.
One promising approach currently in clinical trials involves
inhibition of telomerase activity, leading to telomere shortening
and senescence (6). Our laboratory has developed an alternative
approach for targeting telomerase in cancer cells that involves
the expression of mutated hTER with an altered template sequence
(7, 8). These mutant template hTERs, hereafter referred to as
MT-hTers, complex with hTERT in tumor cells and direct the
addition of mutant telomeric repeats that are predicted to disrupt
binding of shelterin components (7, 9, 10). MT-hTer treatment
rapidly induces a DNA damage response, as indicated by the
presence of DNA damage foci (which include 53BP1, RIF1, and
g-H2AX) that colocalize with telomeres (11, 12). In diverse cancer
cell types, MT-hTer treatment quickly results in apoptosis and
growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo (7, 13). Importantly, this
growth inhibition does not rely on p53 and pRb status and only
occurs in cells that also express hTERT (13). In this article, we focus
on the ‘‘47A’’ mutant version of hTER (MT-hTer-47A), which has
two mutated base pairs in the partially repeated hTER template
region, and hence is predicted to direct the addition of TTTGGG
repeats, instead of wild-type TTAGGG repeats, onto telomeres
(9, 13). MT-hTer-47A has shown robust antiproliferative effects in a
variety of different telomerase-positive cancer cell lines (9, 13).
We focus here on the role of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) protein in the response to MT-hTer-47A–induced telomere
dysfunction. ATM is a phosphatidylinositol-3-like kinase that
functions at both telomeres and DNA double-strand breaks (DSB;
refs. 14, 15). Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have shown that
disruption of ATM signaling causes telomere shortening, at least
in part by decreasing telomerase recruitment to the telomeres
(16–18). In addition, loss of ATM function affects the frequency of
end-to-end telomere fusions. In experiments involving prolonged
cell growth, ATM disruption causes an increase in the number of

telomeric fusions detected, which may be due to the accelerated
telomere shortening of ATM-deficient cells or to enhanced survival
of cells with end-to-end fusions (19, 20). In contrast, in a more
short-term experiment, ATM depletion protected against fusion
of telomeres rendered dysfunctional by acute loss of TRF2, suggesting that ATM can promote fusion of deprotected telomeres in
certain cases (21).
ATM also plays an important role in coordinating the cellular
response to DSBs. ATM is activated and becomes autophosphorylated in response to DSBs and subsequently phosphorylates a large
number of proteins that modulate the checkpoint and repair
responses of the damaged cell (15, 22). Depending on the cellular
context, the ATM-directed response to DNA damage can promote
cell death by initiating an apoptotic program or, conversely, can
enhance cell survival by activating checkpoints and coordinating
DNA repair (23). In cancer cells, the role of ATM in the DSB
response seems to be largely cell protective, as ATM depletion
or inhibition in cancer cells commonly augments the cytotoxic
effects of ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutics that induce
DSBs (24–26).
DSBs and dysfunctional telomeres share many similarities. First,
both lesions involve exposure of a dsDNA end (2). Second, both
lesions acquire DNA damage foci, which are local accumulations of
proteins including ATM, the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, 53BP1,
RIF1, and g-H2AX (5, 11, 12, 27). Third, the cellular response to
both types of lesions can ultimately result in senescence or
apoptosis, depending on the cellular context (5, 28). Given these
similarities, we tested whether ATM depletion would sensitize
cancer cells to the effects of MT-hTer-47A, just as it sensitizes them
to treatments that induce intrachromosomal DSBs.
We show first that, as anticipated, ATM is activated in response
to MT-hTer-47A overexpression. Surprisingly, depletion of ATM
does not sensitize the cancer cells to subsequent MT-hTer-47A
treatment. Instead, the cells become largely unresponsive to MThTer-47A–induced dysfunctional telomeres, which persist in the
proliferating cells. Strikingly, ATM depletion significantly reduces
the frequency of end-to-end fusion of MT-hTer-47A–induced
dysfunctional telomeres. These results identify ATM as a key
mediator of MT-hTer-47A–induced cytotoxicity, in marked contrast
to the protective role of ATM in the response to damaging agents
that cause intrachromosomal DSBs.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. LOX melanoma cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). UM-UC-3 bladder
cancer and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Plasmids and lentivirus. The lentiviral vector system was provided by
D. Trono (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; ref. 29). Lentivirus was
prepared as described previously (11). The short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
expression lentivectors were constructed as described previously (13). The
ATM shRNA target sequences, derived from previously published small
interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences, are as follows: 5¶-GGTGCTATTTACGGAGCTG-3¶ (ATM shRNA #1) and 5¶-GCAACATACTACTCAAAGA-3¶ (ATM
shRNA #2; refs. 30, 31). The control scramble shRNAs had the following
‘‘target’’ sequences: 5¶-GTTCTACAACGTAACGAGGTT-3¶ (scramble #1) and
5¶-GTCAAAGAACGTTCAGACA-3¶ (scramble #2). WT-hTER and MT-hTer47A expression lentivectors have been described (13).
Lentivirus was titered by plating appropriate dilutions on LOX or UMUC-3 cells and counting the number of green fluorescent protein (GFP)positive foci present 72 h later. For flow cytometry and immunofluorescence
experiments, lentivectors carrying the puromycin resistance gene in place

of GFP were used because the strong GFP expression in LOX cells would
interfere with these assays. Cells were infected with shRNA-expressing
lentivirus at f75 transducing units per cell and with hTER-expressing
lentivirus at f125 transducing units per cell. At this virus level, >95% of
LOX or UM-UC-3 cells received the desired lentivirus as judged by GFP
expression. Thus, because no selection step was required, experiments
could be performed rapidly on the bulk cell population.
Cell growth assays. LOX or UM-UC-3 cells were infected with shRNAexpressing virus at day 2 followed by hTER-expressing virus (either WThTER or MT-hTer-47A) at day 0. Cells were split as needed to maintain
logarithmic growth. Cells were harvested at indicated time points and
stained with trypan blue. Viable cells were enumerated by hemocytometer.
For the MT-hTer-47A clonogenic assays, LOX cells were infected with
shRNA and then the hTER-expressing virus as above. Cells were then
harvested 2 d later and replated at a density of 100 per well in six-well
plates. After 7 d of additional growth, colonies were fixed with 95% ethanol
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies containing more than f20
cells were counted. For camptothecin clonogenic assays, LOX cells were
infected with shRNA-expressing virus and reseeded 3 d later at a density
of 100 per well in six-well plates. After 12 h, camptothecin was added to a
final concentration of 50 nmol/L, and the medium was replaced 24 h later.
The cells were grown for an additional 6 d, and colonies were counted
as above.
For experiments with KU-55933 (KuDOS Pharmaceuticals), LOX cells
were infected with lentivirus expressing WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A at day 0,
with KU-55933 (in DMSO) added 8 h after infection. The drug was replaced
daily, and cells were split as needed to maintain logarithmic growth.
Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. LOX cells were infected
with shRNA-expressing virus at day 2 and with hTER-expressing virus at
day 0. For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips on
day 4. On day 6, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and
permeabilized with 0.5% NP40 in PBS. Immunostaining was performed with
rabbit anti-Rap1 (Bethyl Laboratories) and mouse anti-ATM pS1981
(Rockland) followed by the appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or 568
antibody (Molecular Probes; refs. 11, 15). DNA was visualized with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole. Analysis was performed using the DeltaVision
Restoration Microscopy System (Applied Precision) with a 60 objective
and 1.5 magnifier. Images were acquired using the DeltaVision SoftWorx
3D capture program. Images were subjected to deconvolution and are
presented as quick projections. All images were captured using identical
exposure times, and signal intensities were standardized to allow
comparison of relative intensities.
For flow cytometry, cells were stained with Annexin V-phycoerythrin and
7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) per manufacturer’s protocol (BD PharMingen), and analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences).
Western blotting. Cells were resuspended in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), 250 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.1% NP40 containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles. Lysates
were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and samples were
run on SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis was performed with the
following antibodies: mouse anti-ATM pS1981, mouse anti-ATM (2C1;
GeneTex, Inc.), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse antih-actin (Abcam). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were
used for ATM blots, and immunostaining was detected using ECL Plus
Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare).
Real-time PCR and gene sequencing. RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Mini kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). Reverse
transcription was performed with StrataScript III and random primers
per manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen), and real-time quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was performed using Brilliant SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix on the
Mx3000P real-time system (Stratagene). The following primers were used
for qPCR: 5¶-TCACGTCATCCAGCAGAGAATGGA-3¶ and 5¶-CACACGGCAGGCATACTCATCTTT-3¶ (h2-microglobulin); 5¶-TTGCGGAGGGTGGGCCT-3¶ and 5¶-CGGGCCAGCAGCTGACATT-3¶ (hTER). Data were analyzed
using the MXPro software (Stratagene).
For confirmatory sequencing of the UM-UC-3 p53 mutation, amplification of a portion of p53 exon 4 from UM-UC-3 genomic DNA was performed

with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) using the following primers: 5¶-GCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTT-3¶ and 5¶-AGGAAGCCAAAGGGTGAAGAGGAA3¶. Automated sequencing was then performed on both strands with the
following nested primers: 5¶-AGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGA-3¶ and
5¶-ATACGGCCAGGCATTGAAGTCTCA-3¶.
Telomeric Southern blotting. UM-UC-3 genomic DNA was digested
with HinfI and RsaI and run on a 0.6% agarose gel with 5 Ag of DNA
per lane. DNA was transferred to Hybond XL membrane (GE Healthcare),
and wild-type telomeric sequence was detected using a 32P-labeled 5¶(CCCTAA)4-3¶ probe. For detection of mutant repeats, a 32P-labeled
5¶-(CCCAAA)4-3¶ probe was used along with a 4-fold excess of unlabeled
5¶-(CCCTAA)4-3¶ and 5¶-(CCCCAA)4-3¶ oligonucleotides to block crosshybridization to wild-type and subtelomeric sequences (9).
Telomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization. Telomeric fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed and imaged as described
previously, except with a 4-h colcemid treatment (32). Telomeric fusions
were scored in a blinded fashion. Only fusions involving both sister
chromatids were counted.

Results
MT-hTer-47A expression activates ATM. We first evaluated
whether MT-hTer-47A expression in cancer cells induces activation
of ATM, which is normally present in an inactive unphosphorylated
form. An appropriate DNA damage stimulus leads to ATM
autophosphorylation at Ser1981 (15). LOX melanoma cells were
infected with lentivirus overexpressing either a wild-type version of
hTER (WT-hTER) or MT-hTer-47A. In contrast to WT-hTER
overexpression, MT-hTer-47A expression induced phosphorylated
ATM foci, as shown by immunofluorescence using an antibody
specific for ATM phosphorylated at Ser1981 (Fig. 1). The large
majority of these activated ATM foci colocalized with telomeric
Rap1 foci, consistent with prior results showing that most MThTer-47A–induced DNA damage foci are telomeric (11, 12). The
phosphorylation of ATM in response to MT-hTer-47A expression
was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1).

melanoma cells were infected with lentivirus expressing the indicated shRNAs

blot, with actin serving as a loading control. B, LOX cells were infected with
scramble #1 or ATM #2 shRNAs and seeded in six-well plates 3 d later at a
density of 100 per well. After 12 h, the cells were treated with 50 nmol/L
camptothecin in DMSO (CPT ) or DMSO alone (no drug ). The medium was
replaced 24 h later and the cells were grown for an additional 6 d. Cells were
fixed and stained with crystal violet to assess colony number, and images
of representative wells are shown. C, the graph shows the fraction of LOX
colonies surviving camptothecin treatment relative to the corresponding DMSO

ATM depletion abrogates the cancer cell response to MThTer-47A expression. To understand the role of ATM in the
MT-hTer-47A response, we designed two lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting the ATM mRNA based on previously published
siRNA sequences (30, 31). LOX melanoma cells were infected with
lentivirus expressing these shRNAs, and depletion of ATM protein was analyzed by Western blot. Each ATM shRNA caused
significant depletion of ATM, with shRNA #2 showing more
complete knockdown than shRNA #1 (Fig. 2A). As expected,
ATM shRNA #2 almost completely eliminated the appearance of
activated ATM in response to MT-hTer-47A expression, as shown by
both immunofluorescence and Western blot (Fig. 1; Supplementary
Fig. S1).

Loss of ATM function in cancer cells commonly sensitizes them
to ionizing radiation and other treatments that cause doublestrand DNA breaks, thereby lowering their clonogenic survival
(24–26). To confirm that the ATM depletion was effective in reducing ATM cellular function, we tested whether ATM knockdown
sensitized LOX cells to DSBs induced by the type I topoisomerase
inhibitor camptothecin (33). The ATM-depleted LOX cells displayed significantly reduced clonogenic survival after treatment
with camptothecin, indicating that ATM knockdown was sufficient
to alter a known response of cancer cells to DNA damage (Fig. 2B
and C).
The effect of ATM depletion on the MT-hTer-47A response was
evaluated first by measuring cell proliferation curves. As seen
previously, expression of MT-hTer-47A in LOX melanoma cells led
to rapid growth inhibition in comparison with a WT-hTER control
(Fig. 3A; ref. 13). Additional control experiments as well as
previously published work showed that WT-hTER overexpression
itself had little or no effect on cell proliferation, confirming that
the difference in the WT-hTER and MT-hTer-47A proliferation
curves is due to growth inhibition by MT-hTer-47A rather than a
stimulatory growth effect of WT-hTER or other effect of the lenti-

viral transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 13). To explore the
role of ATM in the MT-hTer-47A response, LOX melanoma cells
were first treated with anti-ATM shRNA or control ‘‘scramble’’
shRNA followed 48 h later by WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A. ATM
depletion had no significant effect on proliferation of cells overexpressing WT-hTER (Fig. 3A). In marked contrast, ATM depletion
substantially abrogated the inhibition of LOX cell proliferation
caused by MT-hTer-47A (Fig. 3A). The same experiment was
performed in UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells with equivalent results
(Fig. 3B).
We performed control experiments to confirm that the effects
seen on the MT-hTer-47A–expressing cells were due to the loss of
ATM function. First, to address the possibility that shRNA offtarget effects might be influencing our results, we analyzed the
effect of two different ATM shRNAs, as well as two different
scramble shRNA controls, on MT-hTer-47A–induced growth
inhibition (34). Both of the ATM shRNAs reduced the effect of
MT-hTer-47A on LOX cell proliferation relative to the scramble
controls (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the influence of the two shRNAs
directly correlated with their ability to knock down ATM. ATM
shRNA #1, which was less effective at knocking down ATM, was

Figure 3. ATM depletion or inhibition rescues growth of MT-hTer-47A–treated cells. LOX (A) and UM-UC-3 (B) cells were infected with lentivirus expressing
scramble #1 (closed symbols ) or ATM #2 (open symbols ) shRNAs at day 2 followed by infection with lentivirus expressing WT-hTER (squares ) or MT-hTer-47A
(triangles ) at day 0. Cells were harvested and counted by hemocytometer at indicated time points. C, LOX melanoma cells were infected with lentivirus expressing
scramble #1 (black columns ), scramble #2 (white columns ), ATM #1 (gray columns ), or ATM #2 (stippled columns ) shRNAs at day 2 followed by lentivirus
expressing WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A at day 0. Cells were harvested and counted by hemocytometer at indicated time points. The graph depicts the percent
cell proliferation of MT-hTer-47A–treated samples relative to matched WT-hTER–treated samples. Columns, mean of three separate hTER infections; bars, SD.
Analysis of day 6 data from at least three independent experiments indicates that the increased proliferation in MT-hTer-47A–treated cells seen with the
ATM #1 and ATM #2 shRNAs compared with the scramble controls is statistically significant (P < 0.01 and 0.0001, respectively). The difference in the growth of
MT-hTer-47A–treated cells between the ATM #1 and ATM #2 shRNA samples is also statistically significant (P < 0.02). D, LOX cells were infected with lentivirus
expressing WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A, and KU-55933 was added at the indicated concentrations 8 h later. Cells were harvested and counted 7 d after infection.
Proliferation of each sample is shown relative to the WT-hTER, no-drug control. The growth of MT-hTer-47A cells is significantly increased by KU-55933 at 1 and
3 Amol/L (P < 0.005). Inset, growth of MT-hTer-47A–treated cells relative to the WT-hTER–treated cells at each drug concentration.

ATM Mediates Mutant Telomerase RNA Cytotoxicity

Figure 4. ATM depletion minimizes MT-hTer-47A effects
in LOX cells. LOX melanoma cells were infected with
scramble #1 or ATM #2 shRNAs at day 2 followed by
WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A at day 0. A, phase-contrast
microscope images were obtained at day 8. B, day 6 cells
were harvested and stained with Annexin V-phycoerythrin
and 7-AAD, and staining was analyzed by flow cytometry.
The graph indicates the number of Annexin V–positive
cells (irrespective of 7-AAD status) in each sample.

wells are shown. D, the graph shows the fraction of
surviving colonies in MT-hTer-47A–treated wells relative

correspondingly less effective at rescuing LOX cell growth after MThTer-47A expression (Fig. 3C). Finally, we analyzed the effect of the
recently identified ATM inhibitor KU-55933 on MT-hTer-47A–
induced growth inhibition. KU-55933 reportedly acts as a competitive inhibitor for the ATP-binding site of ATM (24). As seen with the
ATM shRNAs, KU-55933 partially rescued the growth of MT-hTer47A–treated LOX cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D).
Together, these results indicate that it is inhibition of ATM activity
that rescues LOX cell proliferation after MT-hTer-47A treatment.
Previous studies have shown that telomere dysfunction induced
by various MT-hTers results in altered cellular morphology,
increased cell death, and decreased clonogenic survival (7, 9, 10,
13, 35). ATM depletion in LOX melanoma cells before treatment
with MT-hTer-47A significantly reduced all of these effects: the
flattened, enlarged cell morphology induced by MT-hTer-47A was
largely abrogated (Fig. 4A); the increase in Annexin V–positive dead
and dying cells seen after MT-hTer-47A expression was significantly reduced (Fig. 4B); and the drop in clonogenic survival in MThTer-47A–treated cells was largely eliminated (Fig. 4C and D).
The rescue of clonogenic survival by ATM depletion was
particularly interesting because prior studies and this work have
shown that ATM depletion sensitizes cancer cells to drugs that
cause DSBs (Fig. 2B and C; refs. 24–26). Thus, we conclude that
although ATM depletion decreases LOX clonogenic survival after
treatment with camptothecin, it has just the opposite effect on cells
treated with MT-hTer-47A, despite the fact that both treatments
engage a robust ATM-dependent DNA damage response.
ATM depletion does not block hTER overexpression. A
recent report suggested that ATM inhibition blocks efficient
transduction of HIV-1–derived lentiviral vectors by interfering
with successful integration into the host genome (36). Therefore,
we tested the possibility that ATM depletion might have prevented
the MT-hTer-47A effects by blocking delivery and expression of the

www.aacrjournals.org

mutant template lentiviral construct. Using a real-time reverse
transcription-PCR assay, we analyzed hTER expression 4 and 6 days
after infection of LOX melanoma cells, the time period during
which the ATM effect on cell proliferation first becomes evident.
The lentiviral hTER constructs resulted in WT-hTER and MT-hTer47A overexpression 20- to 40-fold higher than the endogenous
hTER levels (data not shown). Importantly, ATM depletion did not
lower hTER overexpression levels, indicating that ATM knockdown
does not block delivery of the hTER constructs (Supplementary
Fig. S3). The same result was also obtained with UM-UC-3 cells
(data not shown). The drop in MT-hTer-47A expression by day 6 in
LOX cells without ATM depletion is consistent with selection
against cells with high MT-hTer-47A expression levels. Interestingly,
this drop was not observed in ATM-depleted cells, consistent with
their being protected from growth inhibition.
MT-hTer-47A induces marked telomere lengthening and
incorporation of mutant telomeric repeats in ATM-depleted
cells. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have suggested that
ATM plays a role in telomere length maintenance, at least in
part by aiding in the recruitment of telomerase to the telomere
(16–18, 37). We therefore tested the possibility that ATM depletion
might have protected MT-hTer-47A–treated cells by decreasing the
activity of the mutant telomerase complex at the telomere, thereby
reducing incorporation of mutant repeats. Telomere length
changes in LOX melanoma cells are difficult to detect because
these cells have extremely long telomeres (>40 kb; ref. 13). We
therefore used the human bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3 for
these experiments (38). Previous work had shown that overexpression of WT-hTER in UM-UC-3 cells induces rapid, easily
measurable telomere lengthening because this cell line has limiting
hTER levels and short telomeres (32). To confirm cell line identity
and p53-mutant status, we sequenced part of the p53 exon 4 from

the phenylalanine (TTC) to cysteine (TGC) mutation at codon 113
of p53 as reported previously (data not shown; ref. 38).
We first showed that ATM depletion alone has no detectable
effect on UM-UC-3 telomere length over our 10-day experimental
period (Supplementary Fig. S4). To analyze the effect of ATM
depletion on telomere lengthening induced by hTER overexpression, we performed Southern blotting for telomeric DNA 8 days
after infection with either WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A lentivirus.
As expected from previous results with this cell line, overexpression
of WT-hTER led to marked telomere elongation, with the median
telomere restriction fragment (TRF) length rising from f3.5 to
f6.5 kb (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2; ref. 32). Notably, ATM
depletion had no significant effect on this telomere elongation,
with the median TRF length reaching f7.3 kb (Fig. 5A, compare
lanes 2 and 4). This result clearly shows that in our overexpression
system, depletion of ATM has no detectable effect on the ability of
telomerase to act at the telomeres.
In contrast to the results with WT-hTER, ATM depletion had a
significant effect on the telomere length distribution observed in
the bulk cell population following MT-hTer-47A expression. In the
ATM-competent control UM-UC-3 cells, the median TRF length
increased only slightly from f3.5 to f3.8 kb (Fig. 5A, compare
lanes 1 and 3), whereas in the ATM-depleted cells the median TRF
length of the bulk cell population increased markedly to f5.9 kb
(Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 5). To confirm that this lengthening
was due to activity of MT-hTer-47A telomerase at the telomeres, we
adapted a Southern blotting technique that specifically detects
incorporated mutant repeats in human telomeres (9). Using this
strategy, we detected mutant telomeric repeats in UM-UC-3
telomeres elongated by MT-hTer-47A expression, directly confirming substantial mutant repeat incorporation (Fig. 5B).
Collectively, these results rule out the possibility that ATM
depletion protects cells from MT-hTer-47A either by blocking the

expression of MT-hTer-47A or by decreasing telomerase activity
and thereby limiting mutant repeat incorporation at the telomeres.
Instead, our findings indicate that ATM depletion allows survival
of cells with mutant telomeric repeats in the bulk cell population
by preventing an ATM-coordinated cellular response.
MT-hTer-47A treatment induces telomere fusions in an
ATM-dependent manner. Expression of mutant telomerase
templates in Kluyveromyces lactis and in a human tumor cell
line has been shown previously to induce end-to-end telomere
fusions (10, 39). Previous work in Tetrahymena and in LOX
melanoma cells has shown that MT-Ter overexpression leads to
the appearance of anaphase bridges, as predicted from telomere
fusions (35, 40).
To explore the effect of MT-hTer-47A overexpression on telomere
fusions in LOX cells, we analyzed metaphase spreads 3 days after
infection with either WT-hTER or MT-hTer-47A, a time when the
growth effects of MT-hTer-47A are just beginning to manifest. MThTer-47A treatment caused a substantial number of fusions (Fig. 6).
Over 50% of the metaphase spreads from MT-hTer-47A–treated
cells had at least one fusion event, with an average of 3.2 fusions
per fusion-containing metaphase. In contrast, untreated or WThTER–treated LOX cells had no telomere fusions. Strikingly,
depletion of ATM before MT-hTer-47A treatment reduced the
percentage of metaphase spreads containing fusions more than
3-fold, with no metaphase containing more than two fusions.
These data show that MT-hTer-47A quickly and robustly induces
telomere fusions in LOX melanoma cells and that ATM depletion
largely protects against these fusion events.

ATM Mediates Mutant Telomerase RNA Cytotoxicity

complex structure, leads to a rapid DNA damage response, which
can ultimately induce senescence and/or apoptosis (5, 28). Recent
work has shown that the ATM and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)
kinases can act as key mediators of this response, with their
relative importance determined in part by the exact nature of the
telomeric lesion (5, 21, 27, 28). Here, we have shown that depletion of ATM in two different types of human cancer cells renders
them largely unresponsive to telomere disruption induced by
expression of a particular mutant-template telomerase RNA, MThTer-47A. With the ATM response pathway blocked, the cancer
cells are able to grow robustly even in the presence of the elongated, dysfunctional telomeres. Strikingly, ATM depletion largely
blocks end-to-end fusion of the MT-hTer-47A–induced dysfunctional telomeres.
Our work parallels a recent study in SV40 large T antigen–
immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which examined the
role of ATM in another type of dysfunctional telomere response
(21). That study showed that ATM can promote the end-to-end
fusion of telomeres rendered dysfunctional through knockout of
the TRF2 protein, which is a key component of the protective
shelterin complex (2). Although our study uses a different method
of telomere disruption (mutant repeat incorporation), we have
likewise found that fusion of MT-hTer-47A–induced dysfunctional
telomeres is largely ATM dependent in human cancer cells.
Furthermore, our work suggests that these telomere fusions at
least partly underlie the ability of MT-hTer-47A treatment to inhibit
cancer cell proliferation. Telomere shortening in cells with
checkpoint deficiencies ultimately leads to what has been termed
‘‘M2 crisis,’’ in which numerous short telomeres undergo endto-end fusions (41). These fusion events initiate breakage-fusionbridge cycles, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis. Our data, in
agreement with a prior study (10), suggest that MT-hTer-47A
treatment similarly initiates a ‘‘crisis-like’’ state, resulting in
significant fusion of dysfunctional (although still long) telomeres
and growth inhibition.
This crisis-like model fits well with several characteristics of
MT-hTer-47A growth inhibition. First, MT-hTer-47A equally inhibits
the growth of p53-positive and p53-negative HCT116 colon cancer
cell lines (13). A p53-independent effect would be expected if
MT-hTer-47A cytotoxicity is mediated through end-to-end telomere fusions. The high fusion levels observed are predicted to
cause genomic havoc and consequent loss of cell viability even in
the absence of a p53-directed response. Second, we have shown
here that the ability of ATM depletion to rescue the growth of
MT-hTer-47A–treated cancer cells directly correlates with a
marked drop in end-to-end telomere fusion events. Finally, a role
for fusions in MT-hTer-47A–induced cytotoxicity can explain why
ATM depletion sensitizes cancer cells to agents that cause
intrachromosomal DSBs but desensitizes them to MT-hTer-47A.
In the case of intrachromosomal DSBs, ATM is required to activate
damage checkpoints and assist in the repair of the broken
chromosomes. By promoting DNA repair before resumption of cell
division, ATM allows continued proliferation without the loss of
acentric chromosomal fragments (42). In the case of MT-hTer-47A,
ATM activity at the dysfunctional telomeres leads to numerous
end-to-end fusions, which are aberrant ‘‘repair’’ events that will
ultimately inhibit cell survival. Our results thus indicate that
although ATM inhibition may enhance the effectiveness of
therapeutics that cause DSBs throughout the genome, such an
approach would be counterproductive in the case of MT-hTer-47A
treatment (23, 42).

Figure 6. MT-hTer-47A expression induces telomere fusions in an ATMdependent manner. LOX cells were infected with lentivirus expressing scramble
#1 or ATM #2 shRNAs at day 2 followed by lentivirus expressing WT-hTER
or MT-hTer-47A at day 0. Cells were treated with colcemid on day 3, and
metaphase spreads were prepared. Telomeres were labeled by FISH. A, a
representative image showing multiple telomere fusions (arrows ) in a cell treated
with scramble #1 shRNA and MT-hTer-47A. B, a histogram showing the
percentage of metaphase spreads containing different numbers of telomeric
fusions. Between 22 and 37 metaphase spreads were analyzed for each sample
type, and results were consistent across two independent experiments. In
scramble #1–treated cells, MT-hTer-47A caused a significant increase in fusions
compared with WT-hTER (P = 0.0001). In MT-hTer-47A–treated cells, ATM
knockdown significantly reduced the number of fusions observed compared with
the scramble #1 control (P < 0.0001).

Although end-to-end telomere fusions almost certainly underlie at least part of the MT-hTer-47A–induced cytotoxicity, it is also
possible that direct signaling from unfused dysfunctional telomeres
induces apoptosis. Prior work in cells overexpressing a dominantnegative form of TRF2 showed that the resulting dysfunctional
telomeres could directly induce apoptosis through an ATMdependent pathway, without requiring progression through S
phase (28). However, that induction was also dependent on the
presence of wild-type p53, whereas the MT-hTer-47A growth effect
reported here is not.
Although ATM depletion substantially reduces the cellular
response to MT-hTer-47A expression in both LOX and UM-UC-3

cell lines, the rescue is only partial. Residual ATM activation may
be responsible for the partial response to MT-hTer-47A because
overexposure of the immunofluorescence images in Fig. 1 shows
weak foci of phosphorylated ATM visible at a subset of telomeres
after MT-hTer-47A treatment even in the ATM-depleted cells (data
not shown). Alternatively, other DNA damage response pathways
may also respond to MT-hTer-47A–induced dysfunctional telomeres. A good candidate is the ATR pathway because diverse
types of telomere dysfunction can activate ATR in addition to ATM
(5, 21, 43).
There is increasing recognition that the response of individual
tumors to a given treatment will vary as a result of genetic
heterogeneity (44). The work presented here suggests that tumors
with low-to-absent ATM, which include certain leukemias and a
subset of breast cancers, may have a muted response to MT-hTer47A treatment (45, 46). Prior work in both model organisms and
mammalian cells has shown that the cellular consequences of MTTer expression vary depending on the exact mutations made in the
template region (7, 47, 48). In multiple organisms, different MT-Ters
activate different checkpoint pathways and lead to growth
phenotypes that can vary from wild-type growth to senescence to
rapid cell death3 (48). Likewise, expression of different MT-hTers

in cancer cells leads to different levels of growth inhibition for
reasons that have not been defined (7). Given this heterogeneity,
it is likely that other MT-hTers will not show the same level of
dependency on ATM signaling and therefore work more effectively
in the context of ATM-deficient tumors. For example, some
MT-hTers might instead act predominately through the ATR
pathway by exposing the single-strand 3¶ telomeric overhang (21).
Thus, a more detailed understanding of how different MT-hTers
disrupt the shelterin complex and engage the DNA damage
machinery may ultimately allow more effective targeting of diverse
tumor types.
