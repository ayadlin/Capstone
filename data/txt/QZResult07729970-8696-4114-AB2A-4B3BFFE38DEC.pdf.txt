ABSTRACT
As phospho-eIF4E (p-eIF4E), unlike total eIF4E (t-eIF4E) essential for normal
cells, is specifically required by cancer cells, it is an attractive, yet unrealized, target
for anti-tumor intervention. Here we identify a small molecule, homoharringtonine
(HHT), that antagonizes p-eIF4E function and eradicates acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) expressing high level of p-eIF4E in vitro and in vivo. HHT selectively
reduces p-eIF4E levels of leukemia cells without affecting t-eIF4E. HHT targets the
phosphorylated serine 209 residue of p-eIF4E and induces p-eIF4E oligomerization,
which enhances its interaction with the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)conjugating enzyme UBC9, resulting in proteasome-dependent degradation of p-eIF4E
via SUMO2/3-mediated SUMOylation. These results suggest that the phosphorylated
serine 209 residue of p-eIF4E might be a potential target for developing small
molecule-based new therapies for leukemia.

Phospho-eIF4E (p-eIF4E), unlike eIF4E that is
essential for survival and growth of normal cells [­7–9],
is specifically required by cancer cells including
AML cells [10–16]. Consistent with this, studies have
shown a positive correlation between increased eIF4E
phosphorylation and cell proliferation [17, 18], and
highly phosphorylated eIF4E was observed in a variety
of cancers [10, 19]. In particular, recent studies have
shown that inhibiting p-eIF4E with small molecule
inhibitors of MNK that phosphorylates eIF4E, exhibited
a potent inhibition for leukemia [19, 20]. By contrast,
the nonphosphorylatable form of eIF4E has been shown

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common
acute leukemia in adults, is a heterogeneous group of
clonal disorders characterized by an abnormal proliferation
of myeloid stem/progenitor cells and subsequent bone
marrow (BM) failure [1–4]. Although a high proportion of
AML patients can achieve complete remission by current
chemotherapies, most of these patients ultimately relapse
[5, 6]. Hence, there is an urgent need for more potent
and safer therapies against leukemia-associated targets
for AML.

to be not sufficient for transformation and even resistant
to tumorigenesis in a prostate cancer model [10]. Thus,
we reasoned that small molecules that directly target the
p-eIF4E but not eIF4E would exhibit more potent and
safer therapeutic effects for cancer.
eIF4E plays a critical role in exporting of mRNAs
of pro-oncogenic or pro-survival proteins having short
half-lives, such as Mcl-1, cyclin-D1 or c-Myc [7].
Coincidentally, studies have shown that homoharringtonine
(HHT), a natural alkaloid that exhibit potent effective for
patients with AML-M5 [21], selectively inhibited the
synthesis of these short half-live oncoproteins [22–24].
These data, together with our recent findings that p-eIF4E
is highly upregulated in AML-M5 patients (Supplementary
Fig. S1A-B), attempted us to reason that HHT may inhibit
growth of AML cells via directly targeting p-eIF4E.

HHT specifically reduces p-eIF4E and p-eIF4E is
a critical target for its anti-leukemia activity
To determine whether HHT specifically affected
p-eIF4E in AML cells, we examined its effects on
p-eIF4E and t-eIF4E, respectively, using Western blotting.
Treatment of THP-1 leukemia (AML-M5) cells with HHT
for 24h led to a dose-dependent inhibition of p-eIF4E
(Fig. 1A). In contrast, t-eIF4E level was not affected under
these conditions (Fig. 1A). Similar results were observed
in primary AML cells (Supplementary ­Fig. S1C-S1E).
It turned out that the effects of HHT on p-eIF4E level
were time dependent (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether
HHT had off-target effects that could inhibit other

specifically reduced p-eIF4E and its downstream molecule levels of leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner but did not alter t-eIF4E.
B. HHT reduced p-eIF4E level of leukemia cells in a time-dependent manner. C. HHT did not alter phospho- and total-Mnk1 levels of
leukemia cells. D. Correlation between inhibition of p-eIF4E and inhibition of cell proliferation by HHT (R2 = 0.87). The inhibitory rates
of p-eIF4E by HHT at various concentrations were calculated through determining the ratios of the gray area of Western blotting bands
between control and HHT-treated groups. E. Correlation between inhibition of p-eIF4E and inhibition of cell proliferation by analogs of
HHT (R2 = 0.98). Leukemia cells were treated with HHT at indicated concentrations for indicated times and then collected for analyses of
p-eIF4E, t-eIF4E, p-Mnk-1, or Mnk-1 by Western blotting and cell viability by MTT. GAPDH was used as loading control.

signaling molecules, we tested its ability to inhibit
MNK1, a direct upstream kinase that phosphorylates
eIF4E [19] and Mcl-1, a downstream oncoprotein of
p-eIF4E. At concentrations that significantly inhibited
phosphorylation of eIF4E, HHT had no obvious effect on
the phosphorylation of MNK1 (Fig. 1C), whereas Mcl-1
level exhibited a parallel decrease with p-eIF4E (Fig. 1A),
indicating that the observed decrease in p-eIF4E levels is
not a consequence of nonspecific toxicity. These results
strongly suggest that HHT specifically reduces p-eIF4E
and its downstream target Mcl-1.
To assess whether HHT-mediated reduction of
p-eIF4E was associated with its anti-leukemia activity,
THP-1 cells were treated with HHT at indicated
concentrations for 48 h and then collected for analyses
of cell viability with MTT and p-eIF4E levels with
Western blotting. We observed that HHT-mediated antileukemia activity was positively correlated with p-eIF4E
inhibition (R2 = 0.87) (Fig. 1D). To further confirm
these observations, we next selected six HHT analogs
with different IC50 for inhibition of cell proliferation
and then determined their anti-proliferative activity and
inhibitory effect on p-eIF4E of AML cells, respectively
(Supplementary Table S1). There is also a significant
correlation (R2 = 0.98) between IC50 values of the analogs
for leukemia cell proliferation and inhibition of p-eIF4E
(Fig. 1E). These results strongly suggest that HHT might
be a specific p-eIF4E antagonist that inhibits leukemia cell
growth.

but predominantly co-localized with nuclear p-eIF4E
(Fig. 2C). To verify this observation, THP-1 cells were
treated with HHT (100 ng/ml) for 12 h or 24 h, after which
the distributions of p-eIF4E and t-eIF4E were evaluated
by immunofluorescence staining. P-eIF4E levels in the
nucleus were greatly reduced after 12 h of incubation with
HHT and disappeared after 24 h (Fig. 2D), but t-eIF4E
was not obviously affected (Fig. 2E). Interestingly,
we observed that HHT promoted the aggregation of
nuclear p-eIF4E in the perinuclear space and cytoplasm,
concurrent with the disappearance of nuclear p-eIF4E
(Fig. 2D, red arrows). Western blot analysis also showed
that HHT treatment caused a marked decrease in nuclear
p-eIF4E level in THP-1 (Fig. 2F).These results indicate
that HHT primarily targets p-eIF4E, especially nuclear
p-eIF4E, in leukemia cells.

The phosphorylated Ser209 residue of p-eIF4E is
critical for HHT binding
To reveal the potential binding sites of p-eIF4E
for HHT, HHT molecule was initially docked to eIF4E
protein (PDB code 1wkw) by implementing our in-house
developed All-Around Docking (AAD) methodology [25].
AAD allows a small molecule to search the whole surface
of the target protein for the binding site that has the lowest
docking score by utilizing Schördinger Glide [26] as
docking software. Then three types of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were performed by using NAMD
softeware [27] based on the initial binding complex of
eIF4E/HHT: wild-type (eIF4E), phorsphorylated S209
(p-eIF4E) and S209-deletion eIF4E-Δ209S, respectively.
Each MD simulation runs 25ns with a 1fs time step,
15 layers of water molecules and 0.5M NaCl added to
periodic water box, Particle Mesh Ewald method to treat
long-range charge interaction, and a 12Å cutoff for van der
Waals interactions.
We found that the flexible loop ranging from 201a.a
to 212a.a. (Fig. 3A, red) was the key region of eIF4E for
the binding of HHT. The snapshots of 25 ns simulations
for phorsphorylated S209 (p-eIF4E) and S209-deletion
(eIF4E-Δ209S) were shown in Figure 3A. We observed
that the loop region in p-eIF4E (Fig. 3A, left) shifted
toward HHT molecule to gain stronger protein-ligand
interaction. A hydrogen bond between K206 backbone
atom O and HHT molecule was formed (Fig. 3B). On
the other hand, the loop region in eIF4E-Δ209S (Fig. 3A,
right) lost its flexibility due to the formation of a local
helix. Thus its binding to HHT molecule would be much
weaker. This could be further explained by checking the
minimum distance of the loop region to HHT molecule
as shown in Fig. 3C. During p-eIF4E simulation, this
loop region was flexible and eventually formed a close
and stable interaction with HHT molecule with minimum
distance of about 2.8Å after 17 ns simulation, as shown

HHT binds to and decreases nuclear p-eIF4E in
leukemia cells
To confirm above observations, we next used biotinlabeled HHT (HHT-biotin) to capture p-eIF4E protein
in leukemia cells. Whole cell lysates of THP-1 cells
were incubated with HHT-biotin and then precipitated
by streptavidin resin. After extensive washing, the
precipitated complexes were used for analyses of p-eIF4E
and t-eIF4E. As shown in Fig. 2A, both p-eIF4E and
t-eIF4E were detected by Western blotting. Consistent
with this, p-eIF4E protein band (arrow indicated) was
revealed with SDS-PAGE and coomassie blue staining
assay (Fig. S2), and confirmed by Western blotting
(Fig. 2A) and mass spectroscopic analysis. To examine
whether purified p-eIF4E protein interacted with HHT,
we carried out pull-down assay using p-eIF4E and found
that HHT-biotin bound to p-eIF4E (Fig. 2B). These results
indicate that HHT can directly bind to p-eIF4E protein.
To reveal where HHT bound to p-eIF4E in leukemia
cells, THP-1 cells were treated with HHT-biotin or biotin
or HHT for 12 h and then collected to analyze the colocalization of HHT-biotin using immunofluorescence
staining with p-eIF4E antibody. We observed that HHTbiotin was present throughout the cytoplasm and nuclei

in pink color in Figure 3C. However, for eIF4E-Δ209S
simulation as displayed in yellow color, the loop region
was always more than 8Å away from HHT molecule. For
eIF4E (blue-color), no stable interaction was observed as
well. The simulation results suggest that HHT should have
much stronger binding affinity to p-eIF4E protein than to
eIF4E-Δ209S protein.
To identify any eIF4E amino acid that was bound by
HHT, we generated a series of eIF4E mutants, including
W56, W73, W102 and Ser209 deletion mutants, and then
determined the ability of HHT to bind to these mutants
in HEK293 cells. W73 is related to its ubiquitination/
degradation, W56 and W102 are involved in its cap
binding activity, and S209 is the phosphorylation site.
Mutation of Ser209 abolished the binding of eIF4E to
HHT, which is consistent with above computer modeling
results, whereas mutation of other amino acids, including
eIF4EΔ56W, eIF4EΔ73W and eIF4EΔ102W, did not affect
the binding of eIF4E to HHT (Fig. 3D). These results show

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that the phospho Ser209 residue of p-eIF4E is critical for
HHT binding and binding affinity of HHT to p-eIF4E is
higher than to eIF4E.

HHT promotes proteasome-dependent
degradation of p-eIF4E via enhancing its
SUMOylation
It has been shown that eIF4E is a SUMO substrate
[28]. To determine whether HHT-mediated decrease
of p-eIF4E is involved in SUMOylation modification,
we evaluated the effects of HHT on both p-eIF4E and
the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)conjugating enzyme UBC9 in leukemia cells. In as little
as 3 h of exposure, HHT induced a shift of p-eIF4E
from the supernatant (S) of cell lysates to the detergentinsoluble pellet (P). This shift was associated with a
concomitant increase level of UBC9 (Fig. 4A). After 24 h
of HHT exposure, most p-eIF4E was present in the­

detergent-insoluble pellet (Fig. 4A), suggesting that HHT
increased the levels of denatured p-eIF4E in leukemia cells.
These results are consistent with our observations that HHT
induced p-eIF4E aggregation in the perinuclear space and
cytoplasm (Fig. 2D, red arrows). Furthermore, we found
that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 strongly blocked
the HHT-induced decrease in p-eIF4E levels in leukemia
cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that HHT treatment triggers the
proteasome-dependent degradation of p-eIF4E protein.
We next investigated whether HHT denatured
the p-eIF4E by increasing its SUMOylation. HEK 293
cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAGtagged eIF4E or FLAG-tagged eIF4E-Δ209S, and then
treated with or without HHT for 12 h. Cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads and
subsequently probed with anti-SUMO1, anti-SUMO2/3,
or anti-Flag antibodies during western blot analysis. We
detected multiple bands larger than the 25 kDa band of wildtype eIF4E (Fig. 4C, lane 4) but did not detect the eIF4EΔ209S mutant (Fig. 4C, lane 6) in HEK293 cells with antiSUMO2/3 antibody after HHT treatment. This result could

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not be repeated with the anti-SUMO1 antibody (Fig. 4D).
Moreover, treatment with HHT (100 ng/ml) increased the
amount of SUMOylated p-eIF4E oligomerization (Fig.
4C, lane 4). These results indicate that HHT treatment
enhances SUMO2/3-mediated SUMOylation of p-eIF4E
but not t-eIF4E. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser209
is required for HHT-mediated SUMOylation of p-eIF4E
(Fig. 4C, lane 6). To further confirm these observations, we
performed a time course analysis of HHT-induced UBC9
conjugation to p-eIF4E in leukemia cells. HHT increased
the binding of UBC9 to p-eIF4E in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that HHT induces
SUMO2/3-mediated SUMOylation of p-eIF4E protein by
enhancing the binding affinity of UBC9 for p-eIF4E, which
in turn might lead to proteasome-dependent degradation of
p-eIF4E. Therefore, we propose a working model for HHTinduced degradation of p-eIF4E: HHT binds to the loop of
201–212aa of p-eIF4E and causes conformational changes,
which facilitate oligomerization and SUMOylation of
p-eIF4E and ultimately lead to its proteasome-dependent
degradation.

DISCUSSION

HHT eradicates human AML-M5 expressing
high level of p-eIF4E in orthotopic mouse
model

In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to
directly target p-eIF4E, an unrealized attractive target
for anti-tumor intervention, using small molecules. The
observation that HHT, a widely marked anti-cancer agent
[28–30], specifically antagonizes p-eIF4E function and
inhibits growth of AML cells expressing high levels
of p-eIF4E by targeting the phosphorylated serine 209
residue of p-eIF4E, but not for eIF4E, for SUMO2/3mediated degradation is somewhat unexpected and of
particular interest.
A striking finding of this study is that HHT might
be the first-in-class p-eIF4E-targeted drug. Computer
modeling results show that HHT molecule could
form a close and stable interaction with p-eIF4E with
minimum distance of about 2.8Å but not with t-eIF4E,
which is further confirmed by eIF4E mutation analysis.
These results indicate that the binding affinity of HHT
to p-eIF4E is higher than that to eIF4E. We also found

To gain in vivo evidence that HHT can eradicate
AML cells expressing high level of p-eIF4E, we
established an aggressive subtype of AML-M5 orthotopic
mouse model. To do this, we engrafted NSG mice with
THP-1 cells, which express high levels of p-eIF4E.
Leukemic mice were intraperitoneally injected with HHT
(0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg body weight) daily for 14 consecutive
days. Consistent with the in vitro results, treatment with
HHT greatly decreased the leukemia burden (Fig. 5A)
and increased survival time (Fig. 5B) in a dose-dependent
manner. Unexpectedly, treatment with the higher dose
of HHT (1.0 mg/kg body weight) completely eradicated
AML-M5 in vivo and all the mice were disease-free
survival on day 80 (Fig. 5). These results suggest that
targeting p-eIF4E by HHT has potential to eradicate AML
expressing high level of p-eIF4E.

that HHT preferentially targets the loop of 201–212aa
of p-eIF4E but not of t-eIF4E, which in turn induces
oligomerization, SUMO2/3-mediated SUMOylation
and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation
of p-eIF4E proteins. Although precise mechanism by
which HHT selectively induces degradation of p-eIF4E
is unclear, the close and stable interaction between HHT
and p-eIF4E might alter the conformation of p-eIF4E and
increase the binding affinity of UBC9 for p-eIF4E, which
in turn lead to enhanced SUMOylation of p-eIF4E.
Importantly, compound structure-activity relationship
(SAR) analysis results showed that HHT-mediated antileukemia activity is positively correlated with p-eIF4E
levels. These findings are of great significance because
t-eIF4E activity is required for proliferation of both
tumor and normal cells [7–9], whereas p-eIF4E is not
essential for normal cell proliferation and survival, but
is specifically required for cancer cells [10, 13, 14].
Notably, we observed that HHT-mediated degradation
of p-eIF4E greatly decreases its target molecule Mcl-1, a
critical regulator that promotes the survival of AML stem
cell [31], implying that targeting p-eIF4E by HHT might
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be an ideal therapeutic approach to eliminate leukemia
stem/progenitor cells of AML. However, considering the
frequent adverse effects of HHT on the hematological
system, gastrointestinal tract and other organs [29, 30,
33], and because HHT also inhibits other signaling
molecules such as p-210Bcr-Abl [24], c-myc [22], Mcl-1
[23], we can not rule out the possibility that HHT may
have additional targets that are involved in both of­
anti-tumor activity and cytotoxicity.
As expected, we found that HHT potently inhibited
the growth of AML cells expressing high levels of p-eIF4E
in vitro and in vivo. Unlike ribavirin, a broad-spectrum
antiviral drug that blocks eIF4E activity through a physical
mimic of the m7G cap, exhibited mild anti-tumor activity
[16, 32], treatment with HHT as a single agent efficiently
inhibited the growth of THP-1 leukemia cells expressing
high levels of p-eIF4E, an aggressive M5 subtype of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML-M5), in NSG mice and greatly
increased the survival time of leukemia mice. Surprisingly,
HHT with the higher dose (1.0 mg/kg body weight)
completely eradicated AML-M5 in vivo and all the mice
obtained long-term disease-free survival.

It is tempting to speculate that this unique inhibition
effect of HHT on p-eIF4E may be further exploited for
the development of new anticancer modalities. The
pharmacological properties of this natural compound can
be optimized and improved by analyzing the structurefunction relationships governing inhibition of p-eIF4E
and target selectivity. In addition, these pharmacological
probes of p-eIF4E can provide important new insights
into the function of p-eIF4E and its mechanism by which
p-eIF4E specifically regulates the growth of cancer cells.

(Beverly, MA).

Detection of binding of HHT to p-eIF4E
and eIF4E

Immunofluorescence assay

Lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH6.8, containing
50 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl/1 mM sodium vanadate/
1 mM sodium fluoride/1 mM PMSF/1.0% NP-40, plus
protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. THP1 cells (1 × 108) were lysed with lysis buffer (2 ml) for
15 min on ice. Cell lysate supernatants were collected
by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and split in
two aliquots (1 ml/aliquot). One aliquot was precipitated
with 50 μg of HHT-biotin while the other aliquot was
precipitated with biotin (negative control) overnight at 4°C.
The structure of HHT-biotin and its preparation procedure
were presented in Fig. S3. After incubation with 100 μl of
Streptavidin agarose resin for 1 h at 4°C with continuous
inversion, the precipitated complexes were pelleted.
After washed five times with lysis buffer, the precipitated
complexes were incubated at 95°C for 10 min and then
loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE for analyses
of p-eIF4E and t-eIF4E by Western blotting, and protein
profile staining with coomassie brilliant blue staining Kit
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). eIF4E identification was
achieved by mass spectroscopic analysis.

Cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature
on slides. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.2) for 4 min and blocked
with PBS containing 5% BSA for 30 min at room
temperature. Staining of cells with FITC mouse antieIF4E antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:100 dilution) was
performed overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 1%
BSA. For Phospho-eIF4E staining, cells were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-eIF4E antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4°C, and then
with a Dylight 488 goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 1 h at room temperature.
After three washes with PBS (pH 7.2), the slides were
mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2phenylindole; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and
sealed. Fluorescence was observed with a Zeiss Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscope.

Co-localization of HHT and p-eIF4E

p-eIF4E pull down assay

THP-1 cells were incubated with HHT-biotin
or biotin or HHT for 12 h. Cells were then fixed and
permeabilized as described above. Slides were washed
twice with 1 × PBS, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal
anti-phospho-eIF4E antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA)
overnight at 4°C. After three washes with 1 × PBS, a
Dylight 488 goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) was added as the secondary antibody.
After two washes with 1 × PBS, slides were incubated
with 4μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin in
PBS (pH 7.2) for 2 h in a humid environment at room
temperature. After three washes with PBS (pH 7.2), slides
were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
and sealed. Fluorescence was observed with a Zeiss
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope.

Purified p-eIF4E protein (1.5μg) was incubated
with HHT-biotin (100 μg) for 4h at 4°C. After incubation
with Streptavidin agarose (100μl) (Thermo, Waltham,
MA) resin for 0.5 h at 4°C with continuous inversion, the
complexes were pelleted and washed five times with lysis
buffer. The complexes were incubated (95°C, 10 min) and
separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western
blot analysis for p-eIF4E.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed twice with 1 × phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2), and total cellular protein
was extracted with RIPA buffer. Protein samples were
subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gels), and

Streptavidin agarose affinity assay

Immunoprecipitation assay

EIF4E cDNA was cloned into pIRESneo-3XFLAG
vector, with a FLAG tag at its N-terminus. Using this
FLAG-eIF4E plasmid, different mutation plasmids
were constructed using the QuikChange® II XL SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA):
FLAG-eIF4E-Δ56 (W56 deletion), FLAG-eIF4E-Δ73
(W73 deletion), FLAG-eIF4E-Δ102 (W102 deletion),
FLAG-eIF4E-Δ56/102 (W56 and W102 deletion), and
FLAG-eIF4E-Δ209 (S209 deletion). HEK 293T cells
transfected with FLAG-eIF4E, FLAG-eIF4E-Δ73, FLAGeIF4E-Δ209, FLAG- eIF4E-Δ102, FLAG-eIF4E-Δ56/102,
FLAG -eIF4E-Δ56 or empty vector were treated with 100
ng/ml HHT-biotin for 12 h, and then lysed in RIPA buffer.
Cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin agarose
(Thermo, Waltham, MA) overnight at 4°C. After three
washes with washing buffer (Thermo, Waltham, MA),
streptavidin agarose beads were resuspended in 2 × SDSPAGE loading buffer. The eIF4E input was detected with
anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

Immunoprecipitation by anti-FLAG M2 beads
was done using the FLAG immunoprecipitation Kit
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After treatment, cell protein was
extracted with IP lysis buffer (Thermo, Waltham, MA).
Cell lysate was then incubated with pre-washed antiFLAG M2 beads (50 μl) overnight at 4°C with gentle
rotation. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected
by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 1 min, 4°C) and washed
three times with 1 ml washing buffer by resuspension
and centrifugation (7,000 × g, 1 min, 4°C). The
immunoprecipitate was detected by Western blot analysis.

Orthotopic model for AML and Xenogen
imaging

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

All animal procedures were approved by the
Institution’s Ethics Committee. To establish orthotopic
model, human AML THP-1 cells were stably transduced
with a lentiviral firefly luciferase. Cells (1 × 105)
were injected through the tail vein into NSG (NOD/
SCID/IL2Rγ-/-) mice. Three days after injection, HHT
(0.5 or 1 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle control was
intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days.
Bioimaging of mice was performed at different time
points using an in vivo IVIS 100 bioluminescence/optical
imaging system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Briefly, mice
were intraperitoneally injected with D-Luciferin (2.5 mg
per mouse) (Promega, Madison, WI) dissolved in PBS 15
min before measuring the luminescence signal. General
anaesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and continued
during the procedure with 2% isoflurane introduced
through a nose cone.
