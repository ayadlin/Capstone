ABSTRACT:
We sought to investigate the demographics and tumor-associated features in
patients with gastroesophageal (GE) malignancies referred to our Phase I Program
who had formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from archival or new biopsies
tested for MET mutation and/or amplification. MET amplification was found in 5 of
76 (6.6%) patients (3/34 [8.8%] esophageal, 2/26 [7.7%] gastric and none in 22
gastroesophageal junction cancers). The only MET mutation detected in 3 of 41 (7.3%)
patients was N375S. No demographic and histologic characteristics were associated
with specific MET abnormalities. Median overall survival was 3 and 5 months for
patients with and without a MET alteration, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1;
95% CI, 0.8 to 5.5; P=.14). Sixteen of 81 (20%) patients were enrolled in a c-MET
inhibitor trial. Best responses were stable disease in 3 patients (19%), including a
patient with esophageal adenocarcinoma that remained on the trial for 9.9 months
(wild-type for MET abnormality). All tumors with MET abnormality (n=3) progressed
on a c-MET inhibitor in fewer than 2 months. In conclusion, MET abnormalities can
be found in a small group of patients with GE adenocarcinoma and further studies
are necessary to better characterize the prognostic and predictive impact of MET
alterations.

INTRODUCTION

selected patient population harboring overexpression of
HER-2, is a recent advance in the treatment of gastric and
gastroesophageal (GE) cancer.[4] Genomic sequencing of
these tumors suggests that exploring molecular aberrations
in selected patients may offer new avenues for targeted
therapeutic opportunities.[5, 6].
MET-positive GE cancer is a promising molecular
subtype, particularly as a potential target for c-MET
inhibitors. MET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor

Cancers of the upper digestive system are a global
burden.[1] The prognosis of individuals with advanced
esophageal, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and
gastric cancer is poor[2, 3], and the development of new
treatment strategies is an unmeet need. The approval of

evaluated for MET mutation/variant (41 patients) or
amplification (76 patients). Thirty-six patients were tested
simultaneously for both genetic abnormalities. Except
for two patients with a neuroendocrine histology and
one with squamous cell cancer, all remaining patients
had adenocarcinoma. Median age at diagnosis was 56
years (range, 27-88 years). The median number of prior
therapies was 2 (range, 0-5). Patient characteristics
according to MET status are summarized in Table 1.	

whose activation is involved in cancer progression.[7, 8]
c-MET is physiologically activated by its natural ligand,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)[9]. Paracrine HGFinduced activation of c-MET plays in important role in the
pathogenesis of gastric cancers.[10] Moreover, MET gene
amplification is one of the well-recognized mechanisms of
c-MET overexpression and constitutive activation of MET/
HGF pathway [11], and has been reported in 2% to 10%
of GE adenocarcinomas.[12, 13] The results of the same
studies showed that MET positivity is an independent
factor for poor survival regardless of disease stage. In
agreement with this observation, MET amplified tumors
display a higher pathologic grade and present at a more
advanced stage.[12] Taken together, this data suggest that
c-MET is an important target in GE cancers.
Although far less frequent, MET mutations have
also been described as a mechanism for c-MET pathway
activation in gastric cancer and in other malignancies.
[14, 15] The recognition of this subset of GE cancer
with its poor prognosis is important for referring affected
patients to clinical trials with experimental therapies.
Many c-MET inhibitors are currently in development
and some of them showed activity for GE tumors.[16] In
a recent case series, two out of four patients with METamplified GEJ cancers had some tumor shrinkage with
crizotinib, a c-MET inhibitor.[12] Rilotumumab is a
humanized monoclonal antibody against HGF, and, thus,
can interfere with the interaction of HGF and c-MET
preventing receptor activation. Early results with this drug
in GE cancer showed prolonged survival for patients with
high c-MET expression[17] leading to a phase III trial,
which is currently accruing patients (NCT01697072).
Similar results were obtained with onartuzumab, another
monoclonal antibody blocking the c-MET pathway, and
an ongoing phase III trial is enrolling a pre-selected
patient population with high levels of c-MET expression
(NCT01662869).
A way to better characterize MET genetic
abnormalities in patients with advanced GE tumors is
sorely needed, especially considering the wide availability
of different c-MET inhibitors being assessed in clinical
protocols. We sought to investigate the demographics and
tumor-associated features in consecutive patients with
GE malignancies referred to our Phase I Clinical Trials
Program who had MET amplification/mutation testing. We
also assessed the outcomes of patients with GE cancer who
were included in protocols containing a c-MET inhibitor.

MET genetic aberrations
Five out of 76 (6.6%) patients had a MET gene
amplification in FISH analysis (3 esophageal and 2
gastric cancers, all adenocarcinomas). The copy number
of the MET gene in relation to CEP7 ranged from 3.11
to 16.4. A MET mutation/variant was detected in 3 out
of 41 patients (7.3%). Of these patients, two had gastric
and one had esophageal cancer. All mutations/variants
detected were N375S, which has been previously reported
as a polymorphism[18] (Table 2). MET amplification
and mutation were mutually exclusive in patients
simultaneously tested for both aberrations (n=36). The
prevalence of MET mutation/variant and amplification was
similar regardless what site of disease was tested (MET
mutation, 7% vs. 9%; MET amplification, 8% vs. 6%, for
primary vs. metastatic tissue, respectively)

RESULTS

No meaningful differences were detected in the age
of diagnosis or number and pattern of metastatic sites
among patients with MET mutation/amplification and
wild-type patients (Table 1). There was a higher proportion
of female and Asian individuals among patients testing
positive for a MET variant (2 out of 3, 67%) although the
numbers are too small for definitive conclusions to be
drawn. The proportion of poorly differentiated tumors was
similar in MET positive patients compared to wild-type
as well (1 out of 3 for MET mutated versus 22 out of 38
for nonmutated and 3 out of 5 for MET amplified versus
37 out of 71 for patients with non-amplified MET). Few
concomitant mutations were observed in the MET positive
population: one patient with a MET variant and one with
MET amplification had a concomitant TP53 mutation,
while MET and HER-2 amplification were simultaneously
detected in one patient (Table 2).

responses were stable disease in three patients (Figure
2A). Median PFS was 1.4 months (range 0.33 to 9.9

(MET negative group, n=30). Median OS from Phase
I consult was 3 months versus 5 months for the MET
positive and negative groups, respectively (HR for death
= 2.1, 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.5, p=0.14; Figure 1).
Of the 81 patients included in this analysis, 44

Of note, the three patients with a MET abnormality were
treated on a Phase I protocol containing a c-MET inhibitor.
These patients had a PFS on these protocols of 1.0, 1.0 and
1.5 months (Table 2). Median PFS for the MET negative
population on their first Phase I treatment regimen was
1.8 months (range, 0.26 to 9.9 months). Sixteen out of

DISCUSSION

1.0

Here we report MET amplification in 6.6% (5 out
of 76) patients with advanced GE cancers referred to our
Phase I department. MET mutation occurred at a similar
frequency (7.3%), but was considered to be germline.[18]
Our data are in line with previous series’ reporting MET
amplification in 2-7% of GE adenocarcinomas.[12, 19, 20]
Although we included only one patient with a squamous
histology, the prevalence of MET amplification in this
histology is reported to be as low as 1%.[21]
The prevalence of MET amplification in GE
cancer increased up to 5% with higher grade and more
advanced disease in a previous report.[12] Considering
that our population consisted mostly of patients with
refractory and advanced disease, it is plausible to expect
a higher prevalence of MET amplification compared to
previous reports. However, we could not demonstrate any
significant demographic and/or tumor associated features
of MET positive tumors, including poor differentiation and
an aggressive histology, as was previously reported for GE
tumors and other malignancies.[12, 15] Selection bias is
a possible explanation for this discrepancy, as patients
referred to a Phase I unit generally have a reasonable
performance status. Consequently, patients with a
very aggressive phenotype may have been unwittingly
excluded.
As expected, we detected a trend for a worse OS
for MET positive GE cancers. Although this difference
was not statistically significant, the small number of

trials with these agents (1 patient with a MET variant and
2 with MET amplification). None of them had a response
and their tumors invariably progressed in fewer than 2
months after starting treatment with a c-MET inhibitor.
Similar findings were reported for two patients with
MET-amplified gastric cancers treated with foretinib, a
non-selective c-MET inhibitor.[24] Both were found to
have progressive disease at the time of their first restaging
assessment. Lennerz et al. reported that two out of four
patients with MET-amplified GE tumors had rapid disease
progression when treated with crizotinib. The other two
patients had tumor reduction (up to 39%), although it did
not last more than 4 months. Of note, responding patients
had a MET/CEP7 ratio of more than 5 and both of our
MET-amplified patients treated with a c-MET inhibitor
had a ratio inferior to this. Interestingly, a recent series
showed that the level of HER-2 amplification predicted
sensitivity to trastuzumab.[25] In this study, a ratio
of 4.7 was discriminative of sensitive patients, which
suggests that a similar relation can be explored for MET
amplification and sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors.
Additionally, one of the patients receiving a c-MET
inhibitor in our series had a N375S MET variant. As
demonstrated in preclinical models, this variant may
confer resistance to c-MET inhibitors.[18] Clinical data
suggested that this variant might decrease the risk of
gastric cancer, probably through reduced affinity of HGF
to the c-MET receptor.[26] Although similar prognostic

patients in this cohort may contribute to the lack of
statistical power. We previously detected similar findings
for patients with ovarian[22] and genitourinary cancers
(submitted), suggesting that the aggressive phenotype
conferred by MET genetic abnormalities is not dependent
on tissue origin. In agreement with our results, patients
with esophageal cancer and high c-MET expression had
significantly reduced OS and disease-free survival in
another series.[13] The OS of patients with advanced
MET-amplified GE cancers was previously reported as
7.1 months[12]. Of note, in the cohort of patients in this
study length of survival was assessed from the time of
initial diagnosis. To avoid biased selection, we computed
survival from the time of initial Phase I consultation and
found an OS rate of 3 months. Considering that most
patients had received several prior therapies (median of
2), this is an acceptable result.
It is somewhat challenging to enroll patients with
relatively rare molecular abnormalities that are associated
with a poor prognosis on clinical trials. Out of eight
patients with MET abnormalities in our study, only three
were included in trials with c-MET inhibitors. Other
authors reported an even worse accrual. Notably, of 10
patients with MET-amplified GE cancers, none were
included in a crizotinib trial.[12] Preclinical data suggest
that MET amplified gastric tumors may be sensitive to
c-MET inhibitors.[23] We report disappointing results
for the three patients with MET abnormalities included in

implication was not confirmed in lung cancer, decreased
cell death upon treatment with a c-MET inhibitor was
showed in the presence of N375S variant.[27] In the light
of our findings, the correlation of this variant and response
to c-MET targeted agents is worth of further investigation.
Among all patients treated on trials with c-MET
inhibitors in our series, the best result was stable disease
for almost 10 months in a patient with esophageal
adenocarcinoma who had received 3 prior therapies. Of
note, this patient was negative for MET mutation and

amplification, as well for other mutations tested (HER2,
TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, BRAF, c-KIT, ALK). Interestingly,
encouraging preliminary results for treatment with
onartuzumab and rilotumumab, which are antibodies
against hepatocyte growth factor, were reported for GEJ
and gastric cancers with a high expression of c-MET
in immunohistochemical analysis[28], leading to two
Phase III trials that are currently open for accrual. Taken
together, these data suggest that further studies exploring
different MET biomarkers simultaneously, such as via

Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at MD
Anderson.
MET amplification was analyzed via fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) at MD Anderson or Baylor`s
Cancer Genetic Laboratory. Copy numbers were expressed
as gene copy number in relation to CEP7, a gene located
near the centrosome of the same chromosome. MET was

genetic and immunohistochemical analysis, is necessary to
better understand predictive factors for response to c-MET
inhibitors.
One of the weaknesses of this work is the lack of
analysis of c-MET receptor expression levels, limiting
some of our comparisons with previous studies correlating
receptor overexpression with clinical and pathological
features of GE cancers.[29, 30] The small numbers
of patients harboring MET abnormalities in our series
is another intrinsic limitation and precludes drawing
definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, our results add to the
current body of knowledge correlating the presence of
MET genetic abnormalities with aggressive behavior and
a worse prognosis in GE cancers. It is not clear if c-MET
inhibition will offer reasonable antitumor activity for this
population, but further exploration of biomarkers will
likely clarify this issue.

Treatment and evaluation
Patients referred to the Phase I Clinic who MET
inclusion criteria were enrolled in clinical trials judged
to be clinically appropriate by attending physicians.
Treatment continued until disease progression, withdrawal
of consent by the patient, clinical judgment deeming the
necessity of removing a patient from a clinical trial, or
development of unacceptable toxicity or death. Clinical
assessments were performed as specified in each protocol,
typically before the initiation of therapy and then at
a minimum at the beginning of each new treatment
cycle. Treatment response was assessed using computed
tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging and/or
positron emission tomography scans at baseline before
treatment initiation and then every 2 cycles (6-8 weeks).
All radiographs were read in the Department of Radiology
at MD Anderson and were reviewed in the Department of
Investigational Cancer Therapeutics tumor measurement
clinic. Responses were categorized using RECIST on the
basis of specific protocol requirements[31, 32] and were
reported as best response.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed the electronic
medical records of consecutive patients with advanced
esophageal, GEJ and gastric carcinoma referred to the
Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MD Anderson) starting in May 2010 until March 2013.
Patients were eligible for inclusion in data analysis if a
primary diagnosis of any of these malignancies was
confirmed and a tumor sample was sent to evaluate
MET mutation or amplification status. This study and all
associated treatments were conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the MD Anderson Institutional Review
Board.

Statistical analysis

Tissue samples and molecular analysis

Patient characteristics including demographics,
tumor type, MET mutation and/or amplification status and
associated genetic abnormalities were summarized using
frequency distributions and percentages. Progressionfree survival (PFS) was defined as the interval from the
start of therapy to treatment discontinuation for disease
progression or death related to disease progression.
Overall survival (OS) was assessed using KaplanMeier curve analysis starting from the date of the first
appointment in the Phase I Clinic.

MET mutation/variant and amplification were
investigated in archival formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue blocks or material from fine needle
aspiration biopsies obtained from diagnostic and/or
therapeutic procedures. All histology was centrally
reviewed at MD Anderson. MET mutation or variant
analysis was performed in different Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendment-certified laboratories as part
of a gene panel analysis or in a single test. This included
assessment of 182 genes using a targeted next-generation
sequencing Foundation One platform (Foundation
Medicine, Cambridge, MA), 46 genes in an Ion Torrent
next-generation sequencing procedure (Baylor’s Cancer
Genetics Laboratory, Houston, TX) and 53 genes using a
Sequenom Mass ARRAY platform (Knight Diagnostics,
Portland, OR) or a PCR-based primer extension assay
