BACKGROUND. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) have a particularly grave prognosis. In the current
study, an attempt was made to localize chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) followed
by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with locally
advanced HCC with PVT and good reserve liver function. The objective of the
current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of localized CCRT followed
by HAIC as a new treatment modality for these patients.

METHODS. Between January 1998 and December 2003, 40 patients were recruited.
Concurrent regional chemotherapy using an intra-arterial implanted port plus
localized external beam radiotherapy was performed with a total of 45 gray (Gy)
over 5 weeks with conventional fractionation and hepatic arterial infusion of 5fluorouracil (5-FU), which was administered during the first and fifth weeks of
radiotherapy. One month after localized CCRT, HAIC with 5-FU and cisplatin was
administered every 4 weeks.

RESULTS. One month after localized CCRT, an objective response was observed
on the intention-to-treat analysis in 18 of 40 patients (45%). The actuarial 3-year
overall survival rate was 24.1% and the median survival time was 13.1 months
from the start of radiation treatment. Responders after localized CCRT demonstrated significantly better survival (P 5 .033) than nonresponders.

CONCLUSIONS. The substantial response rate as well as median survival
time noted in the current study encourages the use of this new approach
in patients with locally advanced HCC with PVT. Cancer 2008;113:995–1003.

he prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely
poor in patients with advanced disease. Furthermore, patients
with advanced HCC with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) have a particularly grave prognosis, with little hope for meaningful therapy, as
shown in statistics indicating that the majority of these patients survive no longer than 6 months after the initial diagnosis.1-3 Although
surgical resection is generally accepted as the most effective treatment for HCC, it has a limited role in the treatment of advanced
disease. The majority of patients with advanced HCC are not suitable candidates for surgical treatment at the time of diagnosis
because of poor liver function, extensive tumor involvement of the
liver, PVT, or intrahepatic or extrahepatic spread.
Various nonsurgical treatments, such as systemic or intra–arterial chemotherapy and hormonal or immunotherapy, have been

attempted, but to our knowledge they have shown
little marginal survival benefit. Furthermore, the
treatment of advanced HCC with PVT often poses
therapeutic difficulties.4-11
Recently, local liver radiotherapy (RT) as opposed
to whole–liver RT has been attempted, and the
results suggested that local RT can be effective in
controlling the progression of HCC.12 With this technical improvement in the delivery of higher doses of
radiation to a targeted portion of the liver, the effect
of RT has been substantially improved.13-17 In addition, there has been accumulated evidence demonstrating a beneficial interaction of RT and
chemotherapy. Considering the poor outcome of
monotherapy for locally advanced solid tumors, the
combination of chemotherapy and RT may result in
a higher response rate.17-20 However, combination
therapy may indicate a higher risk of toxicity and
complications than monotherapy. Therefore, highly
selective locoregional therapy will be beneficial to
avoid complications related to combination therapy
such as hepatic decompensation.
We attempted localized concurrent intra-arterial
chemotherapy plus external beam RT (CCRT) in
patients with locally advanced HCC with PVT and
good reserve liver function. After localized CCRT, all
patients were scheduled to receive repeated hepatic
arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). The objective
of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic
effect and toxicity of localized CCRT followed by
HAIC as a new treatment modality for patients with
advanced HCC with PVT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Between January 1998 and December 2003, 40
patients with unresectable HCC and PVT were
recruited to this pilot trial of localized CCRT after
HAIC. A diagnosis of HCC was based on either pathologic confirmation or radiologic findings with an
elevated level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
(>400 ng/mL). For inclusion into the study, patients
needed to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 2. Patients with locally
advanced HCC with PVT in the main trunk or first
branch were enrolled. All patients were required to
have adequate liver function (indocyanine green R15
[ICG R15] <20%, Child-Pugh score up to 6, serum
total bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL), renal function (creatinine <1.5 mg/dL), and vascular accessibility for implantation of a Chemoport (Deltac, St. Paul, Minn).
Patients with tumors with diffuse or multifocal bilobal involvement were excluded to avoid whole–liver

irradiation, which could cause serious hepatic toxicity. Patients with active gastroduodenal ulcer or extrahepatic metastasis were also excluded from this
study.
This trial was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Severance Hospital in Yonsei
University Health System, Seoul, Korea. Informed
consent was obtained from all patients.
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical
characteristics of the patients. The median age was
50 years (range, 30 years-76 years) and the patient
population was predominantly male (36 men and 4
women). Main PVT was present in 13 patients
(32.5%). Serum AFP levels were >400 ng/mL in 33
patients.

RT Planning and Treatment
In every patient, computed tomography (CT)-based
3-dimensional (3D) treatment planning was performed to determine target volumes, radiation ports,
and dose prescription, as described previously.21 The
macroscopic (gross) tumor volumes (GTV) were
defined as the radiographically abnormal areas noted
on the CT. For a better delineation of the tumor volume, a hepatic angiographic image was also used. A
minimum of 5 mm around the GTV was included in
the clinical target volume (CTV). In designing the
PTV, the margins were individualized by observing
liver position as well as liver movement at the time
of simulation. In determining the cranial-caudal

margins, the distance of diaphragmatic excursion by
respiration, which was observed fluoroscopically, was
added to the cranial-caudal margins.
The objective of the RT plan was to achieve the
delivery of the planned RT dose to the target volume
as well as protect nontumor liver tissue. A total of 45
gray (Gy) was prescribed in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy
over 5 weeks using a 6-megavolt (MV) or 10-MV linear accelerator. It was intended to deliver 95% of the
prescribed dose encompassing the PTV around the
CTV.

Intra-arterial Chemotherapy
Concurrent continuous-infusion hepatic arterial 5fluorouracil (5-FU) (at a dose of 500 mg/day) was
delivered during the first and fifth weeks of RT
through a percutaneous hepatic arterial catheter
(Chemoport) implanted at the time of initial hepatic
arterial angiography. This treatment was termed localized CCRT. The catheter insertion and placement
were performed as previously described.9 One month
after localized CCRT, HAIC with 5-FU (at a dose of
500 mg/m2 for 5 hours on Days 1-3) and cisplatin (at
a dose of 60 mg/m2 for 2 hours on Day 2) were
administered every 4 weeks for 3 to 12 cycles according to tumor response; these courses were termed
repeated HAIC. Repeated HAIC was stopped after 3
cycles in the case of progressive disease. The patency
of the arterial catheter was confirmed by angiography before every cycle of HAIC. Intravenous hydration was performed before the infusion of cisplatin
to prevent nephrotoxicity. A scheme of the study protocol is shown in Figure 1.
Evaluation
The primary endpoint of the current study was overall and progression-free survival (PFS). A secondary
endpoint was the objective response rate. One month
after the completion of the localized CCRT and after
every 3 sessions of HAIC, abdominal/pelvic CT was
used to evaluate tumor response. In the case of renal
insufficiency or poorly defined tumor with which to
assess tumor volume by CT, we additionally recommended magnetic resonance imaging for accurate
assessment. The responses were evaluated using
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria on an intention-to-treat basis. The
tumor responses were categorized as complete
response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), or progressive disease (PD). CR was merged
with PR for assessing objective responders. Liver
function, renal function, complete blood counts, serum AFP, and chest x-ray were also evaluated at each
visit. Toxicity was scored using the Common Termi-

as the development of hepatic decompensation such
as jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, or nonmalignant ascites in the absence of progressive disease.
Survival was estimated from the date of treatment
initiation.

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using SPSS software
(version 12.0; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Cumulative 3-year actuarial survival and PFS were analyzed
using proportional hazards (Cox) regression. The median survival time was estimated using the productlimit (Kaplan-Meier) method.

RESULTS
Response and Survival
One month after the completion of the localized
CCRT, an objective response was observed on the
intention-to-treat analysis in 18 of 40 patients (45%),
as summarized in Table 2. A total of 18 patients
achieved a PR, SD was observed in 9 patients
(22.5%), and PD was noted in 10 patients (25.0%).
One patient died before the initial evaluation and 2
were lost to follow-up. The median AFP level
decreased from 9347.0 ng/mL to 1608.4 ng/mL.
Among the 36 patients with an elevated AFP (400 ng/
mL) or protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) (40 mAU/mL) level, it
decreased to less than half in 24 patients (60%).
Furthermore, 7 patients (17.5%) were found to have
tumor markers below the upper limit of normal, suggesting efficient tumor control after localized CCRT.

After repeated HAIC, an objective response was
observed on the intention-to-treat analysis in 11 of
40 patients (27.5%), as summarized in Table 2. Four
patients achieved a CR and 7 patients demonstrated
a PR (Fig. 2). SD was observed in 2 patients (5.0%)
and PD was noted in 13 patients (32.5%). Eleven
patients died before the second evaluation and 3
patients were lost to follow-up. Among the 36
patients with an elevated AFP or PIVKA-II level, it
decreased to less than half in 17 patients (42.5%),
including 9 patients (22.5%) who were found to have
tumor markers below the upper limit of normal.
The mean follow-up time was 18.2 months and 9
of 40 (22.5%) patients were still alive at the time of
last follow-up. The actuarial 1-year, 2-year, and 3year overall survival rates were 57.6%, 32.2%, and
24.1%, respectively, and the median survival was 13.1
months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.0
months-37.2 months) from the start of RT (Fig. 3A).
The median time to PFS was 6.0 months (95%
CI, 1 month-21 months) (Fig. 3B). Demographic variables were not found to be significant predictors for
either the overall survival or PFS rates.
According to the initial response after localized
CCRT, patients were divided into 2 groups: responders and nonresponders. The survival difference was
found to be statistically significant (P 5 .033), indicating a better survival in responders (Fig. 3C) to
localized CCRT. The median survival time of responders was 19.9 months compared with 11.4 months
for nonresponders.

Treatment-related Toxicity
Table 3 summarizes the treatment-related toxicity
>grade 3 during or 3 months after treatment. In
5 patients (12.5%), hepatic dysfunction was observed
that appeared to be radiation-related or chemotherapy-related. Treatment interruption with supportive
care was done for this event. Chemoport-related
complications such as infection, occlusion, or wound
dehiscence after indwelling were found in 5 patients
(12.5%), which were controlled by antibiotic treatment or removal of the port. Gastric or duodenal
mucositis in 12 patients (30%) was found and was
considered to be caused by RT or intra-arterial chemotherapy. Severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia
(toxicity grade 3) during RT or chemotherapy was
noted in 3 patients (7.5%), and all the patients recovered after conventional management.
Cause of Death
During treatment and follow-up, 31 patients died
from several causes, as shown in Table 4. Among 31
patients, 12 patients (38.7%) died of PD regardless of
additional treatment and 8 patients (25.8%) died of
hepatic failure related to an advanced cirrhotic condition. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or sepsis
was another cause of mortality in 2 patients (6.5%).
The cause of death was not clearly identifiable in
7 patients (22.5%).

DISCUSSION
Although transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
(TACE) is the most widely used primary treatment
for unresectable HCC, the clinical results have been
unsatisfactory or harmful for patients with advanced
HCC with tumor thrombosis of the main trunk or

Pattern of Disease Progression
During long-term follow-up, PD was noted in 27
patients (12 patients with intrahepatic recurrence, 11
patients with extrahepatic metastasis, and 4 patients
with both). The majority of intrahepatic recurrence
occurred at the area outside the radiation field. Sites
of metastasis involved a lung in 9 cases; lung and

diagnosis. Disappearance of the hypervascular mass was noted (G) and
visualization of the right portal vein (H) was possible after localized CCRT
and the fifth cycle of HAIC.

chemotherapy has a beneficial therapeutic effect by
increased local concentration and lower systemic
toxicity compared with systemic chemotherapy,25,26
repeated HAIC through an implantable Chemoport
has been attempted and reported to be useful even
in patients with advanced HCC and PVT.27 The overall response rates, however, have still been low,
and the median survivals have been reported to be
<1 year.28-31
Local RT, as opposed to whole-liver RT, focuses
on the tumor site and minimizes radiation-induced
liver damage.13-16 Dawson et al15 emphasized that if
sufficient normal liver could be spared, it would be
possible to deliver tumoricidal doses of radiation to
intrahepatic tumors to mimic surgical resection.
However, to our knowledge, the role of radiation
monotherapy for advanced HCC remains unclear despite the recent development of RT techniques.
Chung et al32 reported that RT, especially sublethal
irradiation, might accelerate the outgrowth of intra-

Localized CCRT for HCC With PVT/Han et al

hepatic and extrahepatic tumors outside the RT field
by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and promoting the growth of hepatoma cells.
In the current study, we found that 12 (30%) of
40 patients had intrahepatic recurrence, 11 (27.5%)
had extrahepatic metastasis, and 4 (10%) had disease
recurrence at both sites.
In HCC patients with a large tumor, complete
necrosis is seldom observed with monotherapy such
as TACE alone.6,16,33 Seong et al18 reported that local
RT (44.0 Gy  9.3 Gy) in combination with TACE
resulted in a better tumor response and a longer survival than TACE alone in patients with unresectable
HCC. These results strongly suggest that multimodality therapy may be useful in patients with locally
advanced HCC.
Although local RT alone can achieve limited clinical benefits in patients with advanced cancer, RT
with concurrent chemotherapy has shown excellent
tumor response with prolonged survival in selected
cases.6,14,15 For the treatment of patients with locally
advanced cancer, concurrent superselective regional
chemotherapy with regional RT can be an attractive
therapy to maximize the therapeutic effect while
minimizing therapy-related complications.34 We tried
localized CCRT first and repeated HAIC until PD or
intolerable serious events occurred. For preserving
liver function under RT, patients with locally
advanced HCC confined to a 1-sided radiation field
were recruited. In the current study, 1 month after
the completion of localized CCRT, an objective
response was observed on an intention-to-treat analysis in 18 of 40 patients (45%). Eighteen patients
achieved PR and SD was observed in 9 patients
(22.5%); PD was noted in only 10 patients (25.0%)
(Table 2). Furthermore, the median AFP level changed significantly from 9347.0 ng/mL to 1608.4 ng/
mL. Among 36 patients with an initially elevated tumor marker, it decreased to less than half in 17
patients (42.5%), including 9 patients (22.5%) who
demonstrated tumor markers below the upper limit
of normal. The actuarial 3-year overall survival was
24.1%, and the median survival was 13.1 months
(Fig. 3A). The median survival time of responders
after localized CCRT was significantly longer than
that of nonresponders (19.9 months vs 11.4 months;
P 5 .0325) (Fig. 3C).
Recent clinical trials of high-dose conformal RT
with concurrent hepatic arterial floxuridine have
demonstrated prolonged survival times of patients
with unresectable HCC, including metastatic liver
cancer. The median survival was 15.8 months and
the actuarial 3-year survival rate was 17%,14 which
are similar to the results of the current study. How-

1001

ever, our study enrolled only patients with advanced
HCC who had a first branch or main trunk PVT with
good liver reserve function as measured by an ICG
R15 test. Ben-Josef et al14 reported that the intensification of liver-directed RT alone might improve the
outcome of patients with HCC, and the RT dose was
a strong predictor of survival based on retrospective
analysis. In the current study, RT was delivered once
daily from Monday through Friday with 1.8 Gy fractions for 5 weeks, and hepatic arterial 5-FU at a dose
of 500 mg was infused concurrently for 5 consecutive
days through an implanted Chemoport during the
first and fifth weeks of RT for radiosensitization. We
did not escalate the RT dose to avoid unexpected
liver decompensation because cirrhosis was present
in the majority of patients.
Multimodal approaches can increase not only
the therapeutic effect but also the risks and the costs
involved.6,35 Hepatic decompensation might result
from an underlying cirrhotic condition with a heavy
nonfunctioning tumor burden in the liver or tumor
progression. Toxicities that were similar to those
noted with other anticancer treatments developed,
including infections, subcutaneous abscess formation
at the Chemoport-indwelling site, leukopenia, and
thrombocytopenia. However, upper GI bleeding from
ulcers or hemorrhagic gastric/duodenal mucositis
might be related to an inevitable radiation effect if a
part of the gastric or duodenal mucosa was included
in the radiation field. To avoid preventable GI
complications, we routinely examined the upper GI
tract using endoscopy in each case before and after
localized CCRT. However, 2 patients had serious
radiation-induced GI bleeding.
Although higher-dose focal liver irradiation with
HAIC may improve local control of tumor growth by
the intensification of local therapy, rapid tumor
growth and metastases can occur during or after RT.
Because advanced HCC tends to have progressive
multifocal spread and exhibits frequent macroscopic
and microscopic vascular invasions, subclinical intrahepatic or extrahepatic tumor spread, which cannot
be detected by an imaging study, cannot be covered
by local RT.32 In the current study, tumor response
within the RT field was not short but long-lived.
Local failure occurred outside the radiation field either in the intrahepatic or extrahepatic site after
localized CCRT. To reduce these problems, repeated
HAIC courses were intended after localized CCRT in
our study design. We evaluated tumor response after
every 3 cycles of HAIC. However, unfortunately, half
of the patients who initially responded after localized
CCRT developed PD during HAIC (Table 2). Therefore, more effective anticancer or antiangiogenic

1002

agents will be helpful to maintain the response after
localized CCRT.
Although our study did not conduct a randomized trial comparing it with no specific treatment
or other treatment modalities, the median survival
was significantly longer than that of previously
reported untreated HCC patients who were not suitable for curative treatment (13.1 months vs 3 or
4 months).2,3,36
In conclusion, localized CCRT followed by HAIC
is a promising approach for the management of
patients with locally advanced HCC with PVT. The
high response rate encourages the use of this new
approach in patients with locally advanced HCC to
reduce tumor burden. Further investigation is required to assess the feasibility and efficacy of combination therapy via a randomized clinical trial.
