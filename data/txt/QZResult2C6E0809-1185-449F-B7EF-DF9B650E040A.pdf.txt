Abstract
While metastasis is the chief cause of cancer mortality, there nonetheless remains a lack of antimetastatic
therapies that are clinically available. In this study, we present the indirubin derivative 6-bromo-indirubin-30 oxime (6BIO) as a promising antimetastatic agent. 6BIO strongly reduced formation of lung metastasis in the
well-established 4T1 mouse model of aggressive breast cancer. Several major hallmarks of the metastatic
process were affected by subtoxic concentrations of 6BIO, which inhibited adhesion, migration, and invasion
of a variety of metastatic cell types in vitro. Mechanistic analyses focused on known targets of 6BIO, which
were silenced by this compound. Unexpectedly, RNAi-mediated silencing of glycogen synthase kinase 3b
(GSK3b) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), both modulators of cellular metastasis
targeted by 6BIO, were not found to affect invasive migration in this study. Instead, the Jak/STAT3 signaling
pathway appeared to play a major role through modulation of its downstream migration regulators Cterminal tensin-like protein and matrix metalloproteinase 2. However, PDK1 and GSK3b contributed to the
overall response to 6BIO, as silencing of all three pathways resulted in almost complete inhibition of
migration, phenocopying the 6BIO response. Taken together, our ﬁndings illustrate the antimetastatic
activity of 6BIO on the basis of its ability to simultaneously inhibit several kinase cascades involved in
metastasis of cancer cells, supporting the concept of "polypharmacology" in developing drugs to attack
metastasis, the most deadly aspect of cancer. Cancer Res; 73(19); 6004–12. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The high mortality rates in metastatic cancer are primarily
due to invasion and progression of tumor cells into distant
organs rather than to the primary tumors themselves (1, 2).
Metastasis is composed of several discrete steps: loss of cellular
adhesion, increased motility and invasiveness, intravasation of
the circulatory system, transport and survival in circulation,
adherence to vessel walls, extravasation, and ﬁnally colonization of a distant site (3). Despite huge advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these metastatic
processes during the last decades, metastasis is still responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality
because speciﬁc therapies are lacking (4). By now it is well
known that development, survival, and metastasis of cancer
cells depend on a crosstalk of numerous signal transduction
pathways (1, 5). Therefore, a change of paradigms has occurred

in drug design during recent years: Instead of monospeciﬁc
agents, those hitting rather a range of metastatic signaling
targets are urgently needed (6).
Throughout history, natural products have played an essential role in the treatment of diseases. Along this line, more than
3,000 species of plants have been used and analyzed for the
treatment of cancer since the mid 1970s (7, 8).
Numerous natural sources (mostly plant extracts) constitute
the basis for multiple prescriptions in traditional Chinese
medicine, being widely used as complementary approach in
addition to conventional treatment of cancer (9). One is Danggui
Longhui Wan, which consists of eleven medicinal ingredients
and was shown to be clinically active in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML; ref. 10). The active component of this recipe
is Indigo naturalis, itself composed of high levels of the wellknown dye indigo and, to a minor extent, its 3,20 -isomer indirubin (11, 12). Further investigations in animal models
and clinical studies revealed that not indigo, but indirubin
exhibited pronounced effects in the treatment of CML (10).
Nowadays, because of its poor water solubility and its adverse
gastrointestinal effects, indirubin is no longer in clinical use (13).
However, a variety of indirubin derivatives isolated from
indigo dye–producing plants and gastropod mollusks have been
discovered and identiﬁed as protein kinase inhibitors (14). In
2003, Meijer and colleagues characterized several bromo-indigos and synthetic derivatives of various bromo-substituted
indirubins, and among these the cell permeable product 6bromo-indirubin-30 -oxime (6BIO) has been described as a
potent inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b; ref. 15).

6BIO Inhibits Cancer Metastasis

In this study, we investigated the effect of 6BIO on cancer cell
attachment, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, the molecular targets of the indirubin derivative
mediating the antimetastatic effect of 6BIO in cancer cells were
identiﬁed.

Materials and Methods
Compounds
6BIO, 5BIO, 7BIO, and Methyl-6-bromo-indirubin-30 -oxime
(Me-6BIO) were partly synthesized by the authors (L. Meijer) as
well as purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. Further compounds
are listed in Supplementary Methods.
Cell culture
Acquisition and cultivation of the human cancer cell lines
T24, HuH-7, MDA-MB-231, and the murine mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1-luc are described in Supplementary
Methods.
Cell adhesion to ﬁbronectin
Adhesion assays were carried out as described previously
(16). For detailed information, see Supplementary Methods.
Attachment assay using the xCELLigence system
Attachment and spreading of the cells was determined using
the xCELLigence System from Roche Diagnostics. T24 cells
were treated with 6BIO for 24 hours and seeded at a density of
5,000 cells per 100 mL in equilibrated E-plates.
Scratch assay
Scratch assays on conﬂuent cell monolayers were conducted
as described previously (17). Details are described in Supplementary Methods.
Migration and invasion assay using Boyden chambers
Assays were conducted using Transwell plates containing
polycarbonate ﬁlters (Corning). For further details, see Supplementary Methods.
Chemotaxis
Chemotaxis of 6BIO-treated T24 cells was investigated by
m-Slide Chemotaxis assay (IBIDI) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Chemotaxis analysis was conducted as described
previously (18).
Apoptosis assay
Quantiﬁcation of apoptosis was conducted according to the
procedure described in the work of Nicoletti and colleagues
using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson; ref. 19). Nuclei to the
left of the G1 peak containing hypodiploid DNA were considered apoptotic.
Transfection experiments
Cells were transfected for 24 to 48 hours using DharmaFECT Transfection reagent (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), GSK3b, and JAK1,

www.aacrjournals.org

and nontargeting siRNA (Thermo Scientiﬁc) according to
manufacturer's instructions.
Western blotting
Protein expression was analyzed by using commercially
available primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Further details are described in Supplementary Methods.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy
6BIO-treated T24 cells were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and
stained with the respective antibodies. Images were taken by
confocal microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss). Details are
described in Supplementary Methods.
Spheroid migration assay
Spheroids were generated according to the hanging drop
protocol as described previously (20). For further details, see
Supplementary Methods.
In vivo experiments
Six-week-old female Balb/cByJ mice obtained from Janvier
(Centre d'Elevage R. Janvier, Le Genest Saint-Isle, France) were
pretreated with 1 mg/kg 6BIO [dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), 10% Cremophor EL, and PBS] or vehicle 2 hours
before intravenous injection of 0.1  106 4T1-luc2 breast
cancer cells. The number of animals analyzed was 11 in the
control group and 13 in the treated group. Eight days after
injection, the lungs of the mice were isolated and the number of
metastasis was determined visually. The luciferase activity of
the lungs was measured by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay (Promega). All animal experiments were conducted
according to the guidelines of the German law for protection
of animal life and approved by the local ethics committee.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean  SD (range) or as
percentage value. Comparisons between groups were made
using the one-way ANOVA/Dunnett and Student unpaired t
test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. All calculations were carried out using the GraphPad Prism software package (GraphPad Software Inc).

Results
The indirubin derivative 6BIO prevents migration and
invasion of metastatic cancer cells
6BIO treatment decreases the ability of T24 urinary bladder
carcinoma cells to bind to ﬁbronectin by approximately 20%
upon treatment with 3 mmol/L 6BIO. A reduction of adhesion
up to 35% was observed when cells were treated with 10 mmol/L
6BIO compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, the
attachment capacity of 6BIO-treated T24 cells to uncoated
wells was reduced in a similar dose-dependent manner, as
determined by xCELLigence experiments (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
To exclude cytotoxicity being involved and to ﬁnd appropriate subtoxic concentrations of 6BIO, apoptotic cell death as
well as loss of cell membrane integrity was analyzed after

treatment with increasing concentrations of 6BIO for 72 hours.
While incubation with 3 mmol/L 6BIO had clearly no effect on
cell survival, a slight, but signiﬁcant induction of apoptosis in
T24 cells treated with 10 mmol/L 6BIO was observed (Fig. 1B).
On the basis of these results, all subsequent experiments on
migration and invasion of cancer cells were conducted using a
subtoxic dose of 6BIO (3 mmol/L).
6BIO strongly inhibited the migration of T24 cells to 13% of
untreated cells as shown in a wound-healing assay. Noteworthy, neither the kinase-inactive form Methyl-6BIO (Me-6BIO),
nor the structurally related bromo-substituted indirubin derivatives 5BIO and 7BIO had an effect on the migratory potential
of the cells (Fig. 1C). Exemplary pictures of the Scratch assay, as
well as the chemical structures of 5BIO, 6BIO, Me-6BIO, and
7BIO are shown in Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3.
To further study the effect of 6BIO on migration in different
types of invasive cancer cell lines, next to the highly invasive
urinary bladder carcinoma cell line T24, the moderate invasive
HuH-7 hepatocarcinoma cells, and the triple-negative breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as well as the murine mammary
carcinoma cell line 4T1 were used. As shown by a woundhealing assay, the migratory potential of 6BIO-treated T24,
HuH-7, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1 cells was strongly diminished
compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig S4). Apoptosis
assays conﬁrmed that treatment of the cell lines with 3 mmol/L
6BIO had no cytotoxic effects (Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, directed migration of the T24, HuH-7, MDAMB-231, and 4T1 cells towards a chemoattractant was also
signiﬁcantly reduced after treatment with 6BIO for 24 hours, as
determined by Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 1D). Representative images of migrated T24 cells are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S5. In addition, analysis of movements of single cells along
a chemoattractant gradient (chemotaxis assay) revealed that
6BIO not only affected directed migration (indicated by yforward index, y-center of mass, and euclidean distance) but
also the motility of cells (accumulated distance) in comparison

3 µmol/L 6BIO

with control cells. In contrast, the overall velocity of the cells
was not disturbed by 6BIO treatment (Fig. 1E).
As a further indicator for a loss of directionality, 6BIOtreated cells exhibited altered localization of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), as shown by confocal laser
scanning microscopy. While in control cells, the MTOC is
localized in front of the nucleus at the leading edge of the
migrating cell, the MTOC of 6BIO-treated cells was randomly
distributed throughout the cell, thereby impeding directed
migration of the cells (Fig. 1F).
Two sets of experiments addressed the effect of 6BIO on the
invasive potential of cancer cells. First, T24 cells pretreated
with 6BIO for 20 hours and seeded into Transwell inserts on top
of a deﬁned layer of Matrigel showed signiﬁcantly reduced
invasive activity as compared with control cells (Fig. 2A).
Second, a three-dimensional model was used: T24 cells were
grown as spheroids, treated with 6BIO or DMSO and embedded
in collagen. 6BIO clearly abrogated the invasion of the cells into
the surrounding collagen matrix (Fig. 2B).
6BIO inhibits GSK3b, PDK1, and STAT signaling
pathways
Next, we aimed to identify the molecular targets of 6BIO
responsible for the antiinvasive action of 6BIO. The known fact
that 6BIO inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b; ref. 14)
was conﬁrmed also for our experimental setting by analyzing
the amount of b-catenin. b-catenin is phosphorylated by
GSK3b, thereby leading to its degradation. T24 cells treated
for 24 hours with 6BIO displayed increased levels of b-catenin
compared with control cells. Lithium chloride, another
reported inhibitor of GSK3b, was used as positive control (Fig.
3A, i).
To analyze the functional link of inhibition of GSK3b by 6BIO
and migration, we treated T24 cells with 10 mmol/L LiCl and
speciﬁc siRNAs against GSK3b for 48 hours. Successful silencing of GSK3b protein levels was conﬁrmed by Western blot

(Continued.) C, scratch assays showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the migratory potential of T24 cells after treatment with 3 mmol/L 6BIO, whereas neither the
kinase-inactive form of 6BIO (Me-6BIO), nor 5BIO, nor 7BIO had an effect on migration. D, treatment of T24, HuH-7, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1 breast cancer
cells with 3 mmol/L 6BIO resulted in a diminished migration capacity as shown by Boyden chamber experiments. E, directed migration towards an
FCS gradient was analyzed by live cell imaging (left). 6BIO signiﬁcantly abolished directed migration and migration distance of T24 cells (right). F, localization of
the MTOC in migrating cells is altered by 6BIO. Representative images of T24 cells are shown on the left. The ﬂuorescent signals of MTOC (stained by
anti-g-tubulin antibody, arrows) are shown. Bars on the right indicate percent of cells with MTOCs oriented towards the leading edge. Bars always show the

Figure 3. Impact of 6BIO targets on cancer cell migration. A, 6BIO inhibits GSK3b in T24 cells, but GSK3b does not affect migration. b-catenin is stabilized in 6BIOtreated cells. This effect is comparable to incubation with the GSK3b inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl; i). Transfection of T24 cells with siRNAs against GSK3b
resulted in a clear reduction of GSK3b protein expression after 48 hours. Transfection with a non-targeting siRNA served as a control (ii). Migration is
neither diminished in siGSK3b-transfected nor in LiCl-treated T24 cancer cells as determined by Boyden chamber assays (iii). B, impact of inhibition of PDK1 by
6BIO. Confocal microscopy experiments showed reduced phosphorylation of Akt (T308) after treatment with 6BIO for 24 hours (i). Migration of T24 cells (iii) was
signiﬁcantly affected after knockdown of PDK1 using the PDK1 inhibitor GSK 2334470 or speciﬁc siRNAs (ii). C, inhibition of JAK/STAT3 by 6BIO.
Phosphorylation of Src and STAT3 is strongly diminished in 6BIO treated urinary cancer cells after 24 hours as shown by Western blot (i). Incubation with the Src
kinase inhibitor saracatinib and the pan Jak-Inhibitor I, as well as transfection with speciﬁc siRNAs, revealed diminished expression of pSrc, pSTAT3, and Jak1,
respectively (ii). Migratory potential of the treated cells is strongly reduced compared with control cells, as determined by Boyden chamber experiments (iii).
D, impact of combined knockdown of GSK3b, PDK1, and Jak1 on bladder cancer cell migration. T24 cells were transfected with speciﬁc siRNAs against
GSK3b, PDK1, and Jak1 (i). Migratory potential of the cells is reduced upon combined transfection with GSK3b and PDK1, whereas triple knockout of GSK3b,
PDK1, and Jak1 strongly impeded the migration of the cells compared with control cells. Bars always show the mean  SD of 3 independent experiments.

6BIO Inhibits Cancer Metastasis

analysis (Fig. 3A, ii). Interestingly, inhibiting GSK3b had no
signiﬁcant effect on the migratory potential of T24 cells (Fig 3A,
iii). Because it is known that 6BIO targets cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDK; ref. 15), cells were treated with 10 mmol/L
roscovitine, a known inhibitor of CDKs. However, Boyden
chamber assays revealed no diminished migratory potential
of roscovitine-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating
that the effect of 6BIO on migration impairment is not mediated via CDK inhibition.
PDK1 was recently identiﬁed by our group as a target of
6BIO, yet unknown (21). PDK1 phosphorylates the downstream
kinase Akt on Threonine 308, which results in activation of Akt.
As shown by immunoﬂuorescent staining, Threonine 308phosphorylation of Akt indeed was strongly diminished after
6BIO treatment of urinary bladder carcinoma cells (Fig. 3B, i).
Next, the expression of PDK1 was abrogated by treatment with
GSK2334470, a speciﬁc PDK1 inhibitor, or siRNA transfection
(Fig. 3B, ii). Boyden chamber assays revealed a signiﬁcant
decrease in the migratory capacity of cells incubated with
10 mmol/L GSK2334470 or with siRNAs targeting PDK1 compared with related controls (Fig. 3B, iii).
Figure 3C, i shows a further target of 6BIO, i.e., the Jak/STAT
pathway in our setting. 6BIO-treated cells showed reduced
phosphorylation and activation of Src and STAT3. To investigate the functional relevance of Src/Jak/STAT3 signaling in
the migration inhibition mediated by 6BIO, we treated T24
with 1 mmol/L saracatinib, a known inhibitor of Src kinase, 10
mmol/L of the pan Jak-Inhibitor I and siRNAs against Jak1, the
upstream regulator of STAT3 activity. Reduction of Src, STAT3,
and Jak1 expression was conﬁrmed by Western blot experiments (Fig. 3C, ii). Boyden chamber assays revealed a reduction
of the migratory potential of saracatinib and Jak-Inhibitor I–
treated cells up to 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively, whereas
transfection with siRNA against Jak1 resulted in more than
60% diminished migration compared with controls (Fig. 3C,
iii). Notably, treatment with the aforementioned small-molecule inhibitors (LiCl, roscovitine, GSK2334470, saracatinib and
Jak-Inhibitor I) had no cytotoxic effect on the cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7).
Having shown that 6BIO inhibits multiple signaling pathways in metastatic cancer cells, we carried out a doubleand triple knockdown of GSK3b, PDK1, and Jak1 (Fig. 3D, i)
and analyzed their impact on cell migration. Boyden chamber assays revealed a signiﬁcant migration-inhibition of
siGSK3b and siPDK1 double transfected cells compared
with control cells. Moreover, triple knockdown of GSK3b,
PDK1, and Jak1 almost completely abrogated the migration
of T24 cells (Fig. 3D, ii). Noteworthy, silencing the expression of these proteins had no impact on survival or proliferation of the cells, indicating that the effect of GSK3b,
PDK1, and Jak/STAT signaling pathways on migration
inhibition is not due to an induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig S8).
JAK/STAT-3 pathway regulated genes affected by 6BIO
Because inhibiting the Jak/STAT signaling pathway has the
most evident effect on migration inhibition, we investigated
potential target genes of Jak/STAT that might be involved in

the regulation of migration and invasion. Thereby, we identiﬁed C-terminal tensin-like protein (CTEN, Tensin-4) and
matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) as being strongly diminished in siJak1-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). To conﬁrm that
these STAT3 target genes were also downregulated by treatment with 6BIO, we conducted Western blot experiments.
While a reduction of MMP-2 expression is only visible in cells
incubated with high concentrations of 6BIO, the protein
levels of CTEN were in fact dramatically reduced upon treatment of T24 cancer cells with low concentrations of 6BIO
(Fig. 4B). Hence, 6BIO impedes the expression of CTEN and
MMP-2 by blocking the Jak/STAT signaling cascade, thus
most likely leading to inhibition of migration and invasion
of cancer cells.
6BIO inhibits cancer metastasis in vivo
Finally, to transfer our in vitro results to an in vivo system, we
made use of the 4T1-luc2 metastatic mouse breast cancer
model (22). 4T1 cells rapidly disseminate to distant organs,
predominantly to the lungs after intravenous application.
Balb/cByJ mice were treated once with 1 mg/kg 6BIO 2 hours
before intravenous injection of 4T1-luc2 cells. Mice were
sacriﬁced 8 days after injection, lungs were isolated and the
number of lung metastasis was determined visually. As shown
in Fig. 5A, treatment with 6BIO strongly diminished the
number of lung-metastasis compared with vehicle-treated
mice. In addition, the luciferase activity of the isolated lungs
of 6BIO-treated mice was reduced up to 80% in comparison
with the lungs of control-treated animals (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
This study designates the synthetic indirubin derivative
6BIO as a potent antimetastatic agent for treatment of invasive
cancer. 6BIO at a subtoxic concentration potently inhibits
migration and invasion of various metastatic cells by interfering with distinct pathways implicated in the regulation of cell
migration, namely GSK3b, PDK1, and Src/Jak/STAT signaling
cascades.
Initially, 6BIO was identiﬁed as a very potent inhibitor of
GSK3b. Cocrystal structures showed a direct interaction of
6BIO within the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3b (15). Along this
line, 6BIO has been used to maintain pluripotency of human

embryonic stem cells (23), to prevent GSK3b-induced glucocorticoid bone loss (24), and to counteract tau protein aggregation in tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease (25).
Recently, to extend the therapeutic application of 6BIO
beyond its usage as a GSK3b inhibitor, a panel of various
isolated kinases has been tested for inhibition by 6BIO (21, 26).
However, until now, most of the data obtained have not been
validated in cellular systems in detail.
It is known that 6BIO is able to induce apoptosis in melanoma and breast cancer cells (27, 28). Liu and colleagues
showed that 6BIO exerts its proapoptotic effects on human
melanoma cells by inhibiting Jak/STAT3 signaling pathways
(27). Interestingly, 6BIO also suppressed tumor growth in a
human melanoma xenograft model. The fact that the compound was administrated orally makes it a very promising
therapeutic agent for treatment of cancer in general. However,
the authors had to use very high concentrations of 6BIO (50
mg/kg) to observe inhibition of tumor growth in vivo (27).
Up till now, there is only one study illustrating the effect of
6BIO on migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo. Williams and colleagues showed that 6BIO reduces the
invasive potential of glioma cells through the speciﬁc suppression of GSK3b signaling pathways (29). They state that activation of GSK3b promotes glioma migration through phosphorylation and degradation of b-catenin. Therefore, inhibition of this signaling pathway by 6BIO stabilizes b-catenin and
subsequently reduces cell migration and invasion. However,
the inﬂuence of GSK3b on cellular migration is controversial.
Conﬂicting reports show decreased cell migration after inhibition of GSK3b (30), whereas other reports provide strong
evidence that GSK3b inhibition most likely promotes cancer
cell invasion and metastasis (31). According to this, silencing of
b-catenin did not result in complete rescue of 6BIO's antimigratory effects in glioma cells (29), thus indicating that GSK3b
is not the only regulator of migration inhibition mediated by
6BIO.
These data were reinforced and extended by our own work
showing a strong inhibition of migration and invasion in 6BIOtreated cancer cells. Although we were able to conﬁrm GSK3b
as a target of 6BIO, inhibiting its expression by LiCl and siRNAs

6010

surprisingly had no effect on migration. This implies that, at
least in the case of our metastatic cancer cells, 6BIO exerts its
effects on metastasis inhibition by suppressing further molecular targets besides GSK3b.
Recently, by inverse in silico screening, PDK1 was identiﬁed
as a potential target of 6BIO (21). This could be veriﬁed by our
experiments showing reduced phosphorylation of Akt, the
main substrate of PDK1 after treatment with 6BIO. It has been
reported that inhibition of PDK1 in MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells strongly reduced adhesion, migration, and motility
of the cells by impairing EGF-induced activation of Akt and
PKCz (32). The fact that depending on cell type and cellular
conditions, one isoform of the PDK1 downstream target Akt
(namely Akt2) enhances the migratory and invasive phenotype
of cancer cells, whereas the other isoform Akt1 inhibits migration (33, 34), might be the reason why abrogating the expression of PDK1 by siRNA as well as by using a speciﬁc PDK1
inhibitor in our T24 urinary carcinoma cells resulted in a
visible, but not robust reduction of migration.
STAT3 is one of the main regulators of tumorigenesis (35).
Besides the well-known effect of STAT3 signaling on cellular
growth and apoptosis, growing evidence arises showing that
STAT3 target genes are implicated in migration, invasion, and
metastasis of different kinds of cancer (36). STAT3 signaling
pathways are activated by Jak-family tyrosine kinases, which
cooperate with Src kinases to activate STAT proteins (37, 38).
Furthermore, because STAT3 is constitutively active in the
majority of highly invasive cancer types, inhibition of tyrosine
kinase pathways mediating STAT3 activation might be a
promising therapeutic option for treatment of metastatic
cancers (39). Indeed, blocking of STAT3 signaling cascades
using small-molecule inhibitors suppresses migration and
invasion of breast cancer cells (40). Liu and colleagues showed
that 6BIO is a pan-JAK inhibitor and thus induces apoptosis in
melanoma cells (27). We were able to identify the Src/Jak/
STAT3 signaling as a target of 6BIO in cancer cell migration,
even at a subtoxic concentration. Treatment of T24 cells with
6BIO strongly diminished the phosphorylation of Src and
STAT3. This is in accordance to the study of Ribas and
colleagues, showing by isolated kinase screens that 6BIO

6BIO Inhibits Cancer Metastasis

targets Src kinase (26). Importantly, inhibition of this pathway
by using speciﬁc inhibitors of Src kinase (saracatinib) and Jak
(Jak- Inhibitor I) as well as siRNAs against Jak1, resulted in a
strong reduction of migratory behavior of the cells. Thus, by
impeding STAT3 signaling pathways, 6BIO exerts both cytotoxic effects on melanoma cells (27), as well as antimetastatic,
but virtually no cytotoxic impact on urinary, hepatocarcinoma,
and breast cancer cells, as shown in this study. However,
although the STAT signaling pathway is the main downstream
target of Src kinases, we cannot rule out that by inhibiting
Src activity, 6BIO also modulates other signaling cascades
activated by Src, like mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (41).
STAT3 signaling pathways are known to promote the
expression of MMPs, which are involved in dissemination of
cancer cells. Senft and colleagues reported that inhibition of
STAT3 signaling diminishes the expression and activity of
MMP-2, thus impeding the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells (42). Moreover, invasion of colon carcinoma cells is
enhanced by STAT3-mediated MMP induction (43). These
reports are in accordance with our own data showing that
inhibiting the Jak/STAT3 by 6BIO results in signiﬁcant downregulation of MMP-2 in T24 urinary cancer cells.
Next to MMPs, several other metastasis-related genes are
affected by STAT3 signaling cascades. A largely unknown
target of STAT3 is a member of the Tensin family, namely
CTEN. Besides our study, which shows that 6BIO-mediated
inhibition of STAT3 signaling resulted in strongly reduced
expression of CTEN, there is just one further publication that
links STAT3 with CTEN. Barbieri and colleagues illustrated in
2010 that constitutively-active STAT3 triggers the migration
and invasion of mammary tumors via overexpression of CTEN
(44). Tensin family members are localized to focal adhesion
sites, where they link the cytoskeleton to integrin-based adhesion sites. CTEN is the only tensin that lacks the actin-binding
domain necessary for the interaction of integrins and actin
ﬁbers (45). Katz and colleagues showed that CTEN displaces
tensin-3 from integrins, thus promoting actin disassembly and
stimulating mammary tumor invasion (45). Therefore, next to
MMP-2, CTEN as a yet unknown target gene of STAT3 in T24
cancer cells might be, in part, responsible for the effect of 6BIO
on migration inhibition.
Nevertheless, besides STAT3, 6BIO also targets GSK3b and
PDK1 signaling, both of which are implicated in migration
regulation. Because metastasis clearly depends on the crosstalk of numerous signal transduction pathways, the combined
inhibition of these signaling cascades by 6BIO might have a
synergistic impact on migration inhibition. Indeed, silencing
GSK3b, PDK1, and STAT3 pathways almost completely abrogates the migration of metastatic cancer cells. Hence, by using
multi-targeted agents like 6BIO, that combine the advantage of
synergistic effects together with the circumvention of potential

counter regulation mechanisms, greater efﬁciency in the treatment of cancer will be achieved (46, 47).
The feasibility of this approach is shown by the fact that
the effect of 6BIO on migration and invasion inhibition in
cellular systems could also be shown in a mouse model of
tumor metastasis. There, treatment with low concentrations
of 6BIO (1 mg/kg) almost completely inhibited metastatic
spreading of breast cancer cells into the lungs. We propose
that 6BIO diminished metastasis mainly due to its antimigratory potential. Certainly, we cannot rule out that next
to the direct effects of 6BIO on cancer cells, 6BIO inﬂuences
the vascular or immune system and thus contributes to
the inhibition of cancer metastasis. However, because the
micrometastases are quite small, it is very unlikely that
either inhibition of proliferation or angiogenesis play pivotal
roles in the observed effect of 6BIO on lung metastases.
Furthermore, although treatment of cancer cells with high
concentrations of 6BIO led to about 10% apoptosis induction
in vitro, dissemination of tumor cells is inhibited more than
80% after treatment with 6BIO in vivo. This implies that
apoptosis does not account substantially to 6BIO's antimigratory effects.
By using 6BIO as a chemical tool to characterize the impact
of various signaling pathways on cancer cell migration, we
identiﬁed this compound as a promising therapeutic agent in
the treatment of metastatic cancer.
