ABSTRACT
Trastuzumab is a remarkably effective therapy for patients with human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) - positive breast cancer (BC). However, not all
women with high levels of HER2 benefit from trastuzumab.
By integrating mRNA and protein expression data from Reverse-Phase Protein
Array Analysis (RPPA) in HER2-positive BC, we developed gene expression metagenes
that reflect pathway activation levels. Next we assessed the ability of these metagenes
to predict resistance to adjuvant trastuzumab using gene expression data from two
independent datasets.
10 metagenes passed external validation (false discovery rate [fdr] < 0.05) and
showed biological relevance with their pathway of origin. These metagenes were
further screened for their association with trastuzumab resistance. An association with
trastuzumab resistance was observed and validated only for the AnnexinA1 metagene
(ANXA1). In the randomised phase III Fin-her study, tumours with low levels of the
ANXA1 metagene showed a benefit from trastuzumab (multivariate: hazard ratio
[HR] for distant recurrence = 0.16[95%CI 0.05–0.5]; p = 0.002; fdr = 0.03), while
high expression levels of the ANXA1 metagene were associated with a lack of benefit
to trastuzmab (HR = 1.29[95%CI 0.55–3.02]; p = 0.56). The association of ANXA1
with trastuzumab resistance was successfully validated in an independent series of
subjects who had received trastuzumab with chemotherapy (Log Rank; p = 0.01).
In conclusion, in HER2-positive BC, some proteins are associated with distinct
gene expression profiles. Our findings identify the ANXA1metagene as a novel
biomarker for trastuzumab resistance.

INTRODUCTION

expression microarray and RPPA, respectively) from
the public TCGA database of the TCGA (Figure 1 flow
chart) [11]. Eighty-seven samples with available gene
expression and RPPA data were HER2-positive. For each
RPPA (phospho-) protein tested, we classified samples
into three groups according to their protein expression
levels. The patients expressing the protein at (1) low
(lower quartile), (2) intermediate and (3) high (upper
quartile) levels were classified into low, intermediate
and high RPPA groups respectively (Figure 2A). Those
thresholds were defined arbitrarily, as there is no clear
cut-off reflecting the protein levels in the cell and we
thought those were good indicators of the high or low
protein expression level. By computing the genes with
significant differential expression (t-test fdr ≤ 0.05)
between the low and the high RPPA expression groups
of each protein, we derived metagenes with expression
levels that could potentially mirror protein activation
levels (Figure 2B).
We consequently identified 139 gene expression
metagenes corresponding to each of the tested RPPA
proteins. Each metagene was externally validated using an
independent dataset of HER2-positive BC (the Responsify
dataset), for which RPPA and gene expression data were
available. 10 metagenes passed an external validation
step using the independent novel responsify set (Pearson
correlation index greater than 0.5 and significant predictive
performance with area under the curve of the receiver
operating curves-AUC fdr ≤ 0.05) (Figure  2C–  2D,
supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Although we did not develop these metagenes to
replace proteomic analysis, these results confirmed that,
in HER2-positive BC, some proteins are associated with
distinct gene expression profiles.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that
controls important signal transduction pathways in breast
cancer [1]. Amplification and overexpression of the HER2
gene occur in approximately 20% of breast cancers and
are associated with an aggressive clinical phenotype [2].
Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that
targets HER2, has shown exceptional efficacy in the
treatment of breast cancer [3]. In the adjuvant treatment
of patients with breast cancer, five randomised trials have
shown significant benefit with trastuzumab, reducing the
rate of recurrence by approximately 50%, and the rate of
death by approximately 30% [4–7].
While trastuzumab is a remarkably effective
therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer,
not all women with high levels of HER2 respond to
trastuzumab. The proposed mechanisms of trastuzumab
action are diverse, but it is agreed that trastuzumab must
be able to bind the HER2 extracellular domain and, in so
doing, it inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to
subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation and survival [8].
Mechanisms for primary trastuzumab resistance include
compensatory signalling by other cell surface receptors,
such as EGFR/HER3, and constitutive activation of
downstream effectors or cross-talk pathways [8–10].
The Tumor Cancer Genomic Atlas project (TCGA)
performed in-depth analyses of primary breast cancers
using five different platforms (DNA copy number arrays,
DNA methylation, mRNA arrays, microRNA sequencing
and reverse-phase protein arrays) [11]. Its ability to integrate
information across different platforms provided key
insights; however, the practical translational interpretation
of the data has been difficult, as the clinical part of the study
was not performed in a randomised controlled manner.
Here we developed an in silico bioinformatics approach
integrating proteomic and gene expression data to uncover
novel biomarkers associated with trastuzumab benefit.
By integrating RNA and protein expression data from
Reverse-Phase Protein Array Analysis (RPPA) in HER2+
breast cancer from the TCGA repository, we identified
several gene expression metagenes that reflect the level of
pathway activation according to the expression of proteins
and/or phosphorylated-proteins relevant in cancer. Among
the identified metagenes, only AnnexinA1 (ANXA1)
was successfully associated with trastuzumab benefit in
two independent datasets of subjects who had received
trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting.

Biological relevance of the RPPA-based
metagenes
We next sought to assess the biological relevance
of the RPPA-based metagenes using different
approaches. A comparison of the metagenes to the
reference classes of the Gene Ontology and the mSigDB
signatures of the Broad Institute [12] showed that the
metagenes included a high number of functionally
related genes that could capture the corresponding
protein/pathway activation (Supplementary Table
3-4). The comparison of the RPPA-based metagene
patterns with the RPPA proteomic data demonstrated
a significant similarity (Rand Index = 0.52). The
RPPA-based gene expression metagenes clustered in
related functional groups similar to the ones generated
using the RPPA data (Figure 3A–3B). Finally, by
applying a clustering algorithm to a network built by
linking all significantly intersecting metagenes, we
identified two main sub-networks according to their
ER status, namely ESR1up/GATA3up and ESR1down/
GATA3down, respectively (Figure 3D). This is in line

their association with trastuzumab benefit using gene
expression dataset from the prospective randomised Finher trial. The patients with available gene expression
data who were involved in our sub-study were
representative of the entire population, and there were no
substantial differences between their patient and tumour
characteristics and patients not included (Table 1 and
figure S1). An association (arbitrary multivariate Cox
regression cut-off p ≤ 0.05) with benefit from trastuzumab
was observed for six metagenes, but only AnnexinA1
(ANXA1) was found significant after correcting for
multiple comparisons (fdr  =  0.03) (Figure  4A). Forest
plot analysis demonstrated that tumours expressing
low levels of the metagene derived from ANXA1
(dichotomised at the median) showed a benefit from
trastuzumab (multivariate: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.16 [95%
CI 0.05–0.5] p = 0.002; fdr = 0.03). Conversely, high
expression levels of the ANXA1 metagene were associated
with a lack of benefit to trastuzumab (HR = 1.29 [95%
CI 0.55–3.02]; p = 0.56) (Figure 4A). ANXA1 association
with reduced benefit from trastuzumab was confirmed
on the independent Responsify dataset of HER2-positive
BC patients treated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant
setting (Log Rank p = 0.01) (Figure 4B). By contrast, in
a cohort of HER2 positive patients which did not receive

with the TCGA gene expression analyses, which showed
that HER2 positive tumors were clustered into two
similar major groups based on their ER status [11].
Similar results were found using the Fin-her FFPEderived dataset (Figure 3C). The comparison of the
RPPA-based metagene patterns derived from the TCGA
dataset with the ones generated using the Fin-her dataset
showed a high similarity (Rand index = 0.54) (Figure 3C).
Of note, the ESR1 and GATA3 RPPA-based metagenes
known to be associated with ER-positive tumours were
significantly correlated with ER status determined by IHC
(p = 2.36e−20, p = 1.55e−16 respectively) (Figure 3E,3F),
while lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck)
and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) RPPA-based immunederived metagenes significantly correlated with TILs levels
(Lck; R = 0.53, p = 2.44e-15 and Syk; R = 0.62, p = 4.14e−22)
(Figure 3G,3H). Altogether, these results demonstrate
that RPPA-based gene expression metagenes mirror the
proteomic status of the samples for selected pathways.

adjuvant trastuzumab (retrieved from gene expression
databases previously described in [13]), the ANXA1
metagene had no significant prognostic value (Log Rank;
p = 0.42), suggesting that ANXA1 is predictive rather than
prognostic. We therefore sought to further explore ANXA1
metagene predictive ability in the Fin-Her dataset using
Cox univariate and multivariable analysis as continuous
variable and interaction tests. Interestingly, the ANXA1
metagene provided independent predictive information for
patients with ER-negative breast cancer with a significant
multivariate interaction test of p = 0.005 (Table 2). As

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ANXA1 metagene was found to be negativity associated
with ER (R = −0.3, p < 0.001), it suggests that in the
HER2+/ER- subgroup, ANXA1 metagene may identify
patients with trastuzumab resistance.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we integrated RPPA and gene
expression data to systematically interrogate protein
pathway activation. To our knowledge, this is one of the
first studies to use such a methodology and to demonstrate

that RPPA-based gene expression metagenes may be able
to reflect proteomic activation status using FFPE samples.
The same general approach was used in two studies
to link upstream signalling pathways to downstream
transcriptional response by exploiting RPPA and mRNA
expression in breast cancer. While demonstrating the
robustness of the approach, both studies lacked external
confirmatory prospective randomised cohorts and datasets
[14, 15].
One of the strengths of our study is the use of gene
expression data derived form a prospective clinical trial
that randomised patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer to receive treatment with or without trastuzumab.
Moreover, the Responsify dataset, in which both RPPA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and RNA expression data were available for patients
with HER2-positive breast cancer who were treated with
trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting with the more standard
duration of one year, enabled us to perform an external
validation of the data in this specific subset of patients.
For the first time, we have demonstrated an association
between ANXA1 and trastuzumab resistance. ANXA1 is a
37 kDa calcium and phospholipid binding protein that is
involved in inflammatory processes, cell proliferation, and
the regulation of cell death and carcinogenesis [16]. Previous
research using tissue microarray analysis has shown that in
some breast cancers, ANXA1 loss leads to faster tumour
growth [17] and cancer progression [18]. ANXA1 expression
has also been found to be associated with a highly invasive

For multivariate analysis, we considered the following variables: age, tumor size, grade, nodal status,
and ER status. The interaction test is for the multivariate analysis
basal-like breast cancer subtype and to promote metastasis
formation by enhancing the TGFβ/Smad signalling pathway,
which in turn facilitates an epithelial mesenchimal transition
switch [19]. Our results regarding DJ-1 metagene, a negative
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulator of PTEN that indirectly activates pAkt [20], are
also in line with previous pre-clinical data supporting the
role of the Akt/mTOR pathway with trastuzumab resistance
[21, 22]. However, this association was not validated in the
30312

Oncotarget

independent Responsify dataset and did not pass the false
discovery rate threshold.
Overall, our finding that RPPA-based, gene
expression metagenes predict lack of benefit to
trastuzumab through ANXA1 raises new questions
regarding the postoperative management of HER2positive breast cancer. If confirmed by future prospective,
randomised, controlled studies (such as ALTTO or
APHINITY) this RPPA-based gene expression signature
could be used to direct the rationale for adjuvant treatment
and research in HER2-positive breast cancer.

The Responsify dataset (as part of a consortium
supported by the European Commission under its
Framework 7 Programme) is composed of 108 HER2positive early stage breast cancer samples treated with
adjuvant trastuzumab for one year, provided by Institut
Jules Bordet (IJB) and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven
(KUL). Gene expression, RPPA and clinical outcome data
were available.

Gene expression arrays
Of the available Fin-her HER2 samples, gene mRNA
expression data was produced from 202 samples. All
samples were re-evaluated to ensure tumour was present
in the specimen. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary breast tumour tissue.
Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U219
GeneChips™ as per Affymetrix protocols on 96 well
plates at AROS Applied Biotechnology A/S, Denmark.
Affymetrix expression data were normalised using the
RMA approach followed by a batch effect correction (affy
(v.3.1.2) and SVA (v.3.10.0) packages of the R (v 3.1.2)/
Bioconductor (v. 2.6) suite) [24]. When multiple probe sets
mapped to the same official gene symbol, we computed
the average value of their intensity. The Fin-her data is
available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.
cgi?token=wfermmkijzktzcb&acc=GSE65095.
The Responsify expression dataset was produced
using an Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2 platform at the
J-C. Heuson Breast Cancer Translational Research
Laboratory (BCTL) at IJB. Expression values were
computed using the fRMA normalization method [25]
(fRMA (v1.16.0)R/Bioconductor package). Again,
when multiple probe sets mapped to the same official
gene symbol, we computed the average value of their
intensity. From the Responsify dataset, a total of
97  samples corresponding to 95 unique patients were
processed. Appropriate quality assessments were
conducted on the resulting files and 94 samples passed
quality assurance for further analysis. The Responsify
data is available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?token=ulwbuuwgpzqphsh&acc=
GSE58984.
Other gene expression datasets of expression
profiles from HER2 positive breast tumors were retrieved
from public databases or authors’ websites (previously
described in [13]). To ensure comparability of expression
values across multiple data sets we performed a 0.95
quantile normalization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study cohorts
Our study used two study cohorts, one from the
Fin-her trial, the other from the Responsify study. The
Fin-her trial is a multicentre phase 3 randomised adjuvant
breast cancer trial that enrolled 1010 patients [4, 23]
(The trial identifier is ISRCTN76560285, Supplementary
Figure 1 [CONSORT diagram]). The women were
randomly assigned to receive three cycles of docetaxel
or vinorelbine, followed by three cycles of fluorouracil,
epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Out of the 1010
patients, 232 patients with HER2-positive breast cancers
were further randomised to 9 weeks of trastuzumab or no
trastuzumab. Two-hundered and two of the 232 HER2positive tumour samples collected had sufficient RNA
with good quality for gene expression analysis. The
clinical pathological characteristics of the HER2-positive
patients with available gene expression data (n = 202)
were compared with the general series (n = 231).
The patients with available gene expression data
who were involved in our sub-study were representative
of the entire population, and there were no substantial
differences between their patient and tumour
characteristics and patients not included (Table 1). The
study participants provided written informed consent
to allow further research analyses to be carried out on
their tumour tissue. The primary end point of Fin-her,
distant disease-free survival (DDFS), has been previously
reported to be superior for the trastuzumab-containing
arms after a median follow-up of 62 months [4].
The determination of hormone receptor status and
HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was
required locally and was performed according to the
guidelines of each institution during the time of the study.
Samples were considered hormone receptor positive if
their level of oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone
receptor (PR) was ≥ 10%. All patients with hormone
positive tumours received five years of endocrine therapy.
When HER2 expression was scored as 2+ or 3+ (on a scale
of 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+), the number of copies of the HER2
gene was centrally determined by means of chromogenic
in situ hybridisation (CISH) in reference laboratories.

Tumour infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs)

Evaluation of TILs was performed exactly as
previously described [26, 27]. Two pathologists performed
the readings independently and were blinded to clinical

outcome; the mean value of two assessments was used for
the current analyses. The correlation coefficient between
the two pathologists was 0.77 (p < 0.001) and 0.49
(p < 0.001) for stromal and intratumoral TILs respectively.

i=1

The metagene score is the scalar product of the
coefficient of the genes in the metagene and the gene
expression values.
To assess the performances of the metagenes,
we compute the metagenes score in the Responsify
dataset and kept only the metagenes for which the score
was highly correlated with the RPPA expression level
(Pearson correlation index ≥ 0.5) and which achieved high
predictive performances in ROC curves (fdr ≤ 0.05).

RPPA
Protein levels were assessed for the Responsify
cohort in the laboratory of Professor Gordon Mills at the
MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,TX) using RPPA
as previously described [11]. Briefly, the tumour or cell
lysates were diluted for and arrayed on nitrocellulosecoated slides. The samples were then probed with
antibodies and visualised by colorimetric reaction. Finally,
the slides were scanned and their density was quantified
by Array-Pro.

Network representation of the intersecting
metagenes
The network linking the intersecting metagenes
(at least 5 common genes) was displayed with the yED
software and data were clustered using the MCL graph
clustering
algorithm
(http://www.yworks.com/en/
products_yed_about.html) [28].

Computation of RPPA-based metagenes
We downloaded clinicopathological, normalised
gene expression and RPPA data from the publicly
available TCGA database using its online bioinformatics
tools [11]. Eighty-seven samples with available gene
expression and RPPA data were considered to be
clinico-pathologically HER2-positive. Pathologically
positive HER2 samples included those with HER2
IHC 3+ readings or a positive result on fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 amplification
(HER2:Chr17 ratio ≥ 2). Each of the 141 RPPA
assay samples available was assigned to one of two
sample groups : the “low” or “high” groups of protein
expression levels corresponding to the lower quartile
or upper quartile of the expression level (Figure 2A).
To identify the genes that were differentially expressed
between low and high expression groups, we performed
a differential gene expression analysis using a Student
t-test with robust estimators of the central tendency
and of the dispersion comparing high versus low
RPPA expression tumours. 139 RPPA assays delivered
differentially expressed metagenes (set of significantly
differentially expressed genes [fdr ≤ 0.05]). Adjusted
p-values (fdr) were computed using the BenjaminiHochberg multi-testing correction method.
The expression levels of these metagenes in the
gene expression datasets (Fin-her and Responsify) were
computed using the metagene score described as follows:
Let S be a metagene (gene signature) composed
of n genes (s1, …, sn) presenting a coefficient (-1 or 1,
reflecting its down or up-regulation respectively). Let E
be the set of expression values of the genes of S in one
expression experiment. The metagene score (sigscore) is
calculated by computing the sum of the products of the
gene coefficient in the module (si) by the corresponding
gene expression value (ei) according to the following
formula.

Intersection between RPPA derived metagenes
and functional classes
To determine whether the size of the intersection
between a metagene sigA of size Na and a functional
class sigB of size Nb was significant, we computed the
hypergeometric p-value, which grossly corresponds to the
probability of being wrong when estimating that having
an intersection of size n genes is due to chance only when
considering N genes in total.

This methodology was used to evaluate the ability of the
model to identify groups of functionally related genes by
comparing each metagene to the functional classes of the
Gene Ontology and of mSigDB.

Statistical analysis
For the outcome analysis, patients were scored
according to each metagene and dichotomised at the
median expression level. The primary outcome was distant
disease free survival (DDFS), which was defined by the
time interval between the date of randomisation and the
date of first cancer recurrence outside of the ipsilateral/
locoregional region or to death, whichever occurred first.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Patients alive at the last visit without documented
evidence of distant metastases were censored.
Associations between the different metagenes and
ER status were investigated with a t-test, while the
association among metagenes was estimated by
computing the hypergeometric significance of their
intersection. The Kaplan Meier method was used to
generate survival curves, and the log-rank test was
used to compare survival distributions. Univariate
and multivariate models were computed using Cox
proportional-hazards regression. Possible interactions
with trastuzumab treatment were tested using a Wald
test after adding a trastuzumab main effect and a product
interaction term in the Cox model. Interaction effects
were displayed using forest plots.
The Rand index is a metric ranging from 0 to 1
which describes the similarity between two clusters.
We computed the Rand indices between the correlation
matrices after applying a hierarchical clustering (Euclidian
distance, complete linkage) and a partition into three
classes with package flexclust (v 1.3–4) of R. Analyses
were performed using the R statistical suite together
with the genefu (v. 1.14.0), survival (v. 2.38–1) and
rmeta (v. 2.16) Bioconductor packages. Our data were
reported according to the essential elements of REMARK
(reporting recommendations for tumour marker prognostic
studies’’) [30]. ROC curves and associated p-values
were computed using the pROC (v1.8) package of
R/ Bioconductor [31].
