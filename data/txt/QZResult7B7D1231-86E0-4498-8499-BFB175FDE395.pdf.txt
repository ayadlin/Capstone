ABSTRACT
Tumor control of hepatocellular carcinoma by radiotherapy remains
unsatisfactory. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a
critical role in inhibiting cancer cell death. Elevated PI3K/Akt activity is associated
with increased cellular resistance to irradiation. Our aim was to determine whether
the inhibition of PI3K/Akt activity by a PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, contributes to the
increased sensitivity of liver cancer cells to irradiation. The hepatocellular carcinoma
cell lines (Huh7 and BNL) were used to evaluate the in vitro synergism between
BKM120 and irradiation. Balb/c mice bearing ectopic BNL xenografts were treated with
BKM120 and/or radiotherapy to assess the in vivo response. BKM120 increased cell
killing by radiation, increased the expression of apoptotic markers, and suppressed
the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. BKM120 pretreatment
inhibited radiation-induced Akt phosphorylation and enhanced the tumor-suppressive
effect and radiation-induced tumor cell apoptosis in ectopic xenografts. Inhibition of
mTOR phosphorylation by rapamycin enhanced the radiosensitivity of BKM120-treated
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The synergism between BKM120 and irradiation likely
inhibits the activation of Akt by radiation, leading to increased cell apoptosis and
suppression of DNA-double-strand breaks repair in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
These data suggest that the BKM120/radiation combination may be a strategy worthy
of clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

strategies to enhance the therapeutic effects of radiation
on hepatic tumors could yield clinical benefits for HCC
patients.
A reasonable way to enhance the response of
tumors to RT is by concomitantly using agents that
inhibit radiation-activated signaling pathways. The
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade is a critical
component of survival signaling. PI3K-activated Akt
(phosphorylated Akt) inhibits cell death pathways by
inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad and

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
prevalent malignancies worldwide [1, 2]. Radiotherapy
(RT) is being integrated with other treatments into
multimodality treatments of HCC, especially for localized
hepatic tumors refractory to conventional therapy [3,
4]. However, radiotherapeutic effects are typically
unsatisfactory because of compromised liver reserve
that makes optimal doses difficult to achieve [5]. Thus,

procaspase-9 [6]. Increased phosphorylation of Akt has
been linked to decreased radiation responsiveness in
various malignancies, including head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma, lung carcinoma, glioblastoma, prostate
adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer [7-12]. Thus, the
inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway may provide a
directed approach supplemental to RT-induced cancer cell
damage.
Several PI3K pathway inhibitors have been under
development, including pure PI3K inhibitors (BKM120),
compounds blocking both PI3K and mTOR (BEZ235),
pure catalytic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitors (RAD001), and the inhibitors of Akt. However,
it remains unclear which type of inhibitor would be more
effective clinically. Both the novel inhibitors, BKM120
and BEZ235, specifically inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway
in cancer cells with different mutant forms of the 110α
catalytic subunit of PI3K [13]. BKM120 has been shown
to induce the significant inhibition of cell proliferation and
apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines, and is currently
being investigated as a single agent in a phase I clinical
trial of patients with solid tumors [14].
In this study, we demonstrated the suppression of
radiation-activated PI3K/Akt by BKM120, leading to
the enhanced apoptosis and DNA damage of human and
murine HCC cell lines (Huh7 and BNL). Furthermore, our
findings showed that BKM120 synergized with radiation

to inhibit BNL cell survival and the growth of ectopic
xenografts. The compensatory role of mTOR complexrelated proteins in Akt activation was also involved with
the effect of BKM120 and radiation.

RESULTS
Radiosensitization of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cells by BKM120
The activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated
with radioresistance. We investigated whether the PI3K
inhibitor, BKM120, can enhance the radiosensitization
of HCC cell lines (Huh7 and BNL). Cells were cultured
at a density of 500 cells per well in six-well plates and
pretreated with different doses of BKM120 (0.25–1 μM)
for 1 hour and then irradiated with different doses. After
7 days, the cells were fixed, stained, and photographed
(100X). Clonogenic cell survival decreased dosedependently either with radiation (Huh7 : 1-10 Gy; BNL
cells : 1–5 Gy) or BKM120 treatment (0.25–1 μM) (Fig.
1A). To determine if the interaction between BKM120
and irradiation was synergistic, combination indexes were
calculated from the dose-response data. In Huh7 and BNL
cells treated with higher doses of irradiation and BKM120,

CI values of <1 were achieved and indicative of synergism
(Fig. 1B).

Subsequently, the cells were stained with FITC-labeled
annexin V to identify apoptotic cells (Fig. 2C). Annexin
V serves as a marker for the loss of plasma membrane
asymmetry representing an early feature of apoptosis.
As shown in Fig. 2C, the percentage of early apoptotic
BKM120-treated cells increased significantly at 1 day
after radiation when compared with sham-irradiated and
irradiated-alone cells.

BKM120 combined with irradiation enhanced the
apoptosis of Huh7 and BNL cells
Since radiation activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, we
investigated whether BKM120 can suppress the radiationactivated phosphorylation of Akt. HCC cells were treated
with irradiation and cell lysates prepared for Western
blotting to detect phosphorylated Akt. Western blotting
assays showed that the levels of phospho-Akt increased
after irradiation (Fig. 2A). The increased phosphorylation
of Akt by irradiation was inhibited by BKM120 (0.25 and
1μM) at 24 hours after irradiation (Fig. 2A). HCC cells
were pretreated with BKM120 (1 μM) for 1 hour and then
with radiation (Huh7 cells: 10 Gy; BNL cells: 5 Gy). After
24 hours, cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting to
detect the apoptotic markers caspase-3 (C: cleavage form).
Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 revealed that
pretreatment with BKM120 increased the expression of
this apoptotic marker in response to irradiation (Fig. 2B).

BKM120 combined with irradiation enhanced
DNA damage of Huh7 and BNL cells
We subsequently investigated whether PI3K
inhibition modulates unrepaired DNA damage, via the
assessment of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX),
which forms foci at double-stranded DNA breaks and
recruits DSB repair proteins. Correlating with the
amount of unrepaired damage [15, 16], the number of
γ-H2AX foci was quantified at different time points after
irradiation (Fig. 3A). Huh7 and BNL cells on coverslips
were exposed to vehicle only (DMSO) or BKM120 (1
μM) for 1 hour, followed by irradiation (RT) with 10
Gy for Huh7 cells and 5 Gy for BNL cells. Replicated
groups of cells were fixed either immediately after RT (30
mins) or the indicated hours after RT. All cells were then
stained for γ-H2AX or nuclei (DAPI). Radiation-induced
γ-H2AX foci detected via immunofluorescence were
apparent within 30 minutes of irradiation and substantially
decreased in number by 8 hours in Huh7 cells and 4 hours
in BNL cells after radiation alone. In contrast, the addition
of BKM120 to Huh7 and BNL cells led to retention of
these foci in a substantial percentage of cells 6 hours in
Huh7 cells and 4 hours in BNL cells after irradiation,
indicating unrepaired DNA damage. Fig. 3B shows the
immunofluorescence staining of γ-H2AX of Huh7 cells at
6 hours and BNL cells at 4 hours after radiation.

The combination of BKM120 and radiotherapy
enhanced growth inhibition of ectopic BNL
xenograft tumors
Balb/c mice bearing subcutaneous BNL tumors
were randomized into 4 groups (n = 5 in each group) to
receive RT alone (7 Gy per day on day 3–5), oral BKM120
(30 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day from day 1–7) alone,
combined BKM120 and RT, or sham treatment. Daily
oral treatment with BKM120 (30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg for
7 days) in combination with RT on day 3–5 suppressed
the growth of xenograft tumors to a greater extent than
RT alone (Fig. 4A). BKM120 itself did not satisfactorily
control tumor growth. The addition of BKM120 enhanced
RT-induced suppression of BNL tumor growth. The
number of days until the tumor volume reached 500
mm3 in the RT+BKM120 (30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg)
groups and RT alone group were 19, 20 days and 14

days, respectively. Mice bearing ectopic BNL xenografts
received BKM120 (30 mg/kg/day) alone, RT alone,
combined RT and BKM120, or sham treatment. One
day after the treatment (day 8), 18F-FDG micro-PET/CT
images showed that tumor viability was much decreased
after combined BKM120 and RT, as compared to either
modality alone or sham treatment (Fig. 4B). Metabolic
tumor volume was not reduced by treatment with BKM120
alone but partially reduced by RT alone. Importantly, cotreatment with BKM120 at 30 mg/kg and RT significantly
improved this radiotherapeutic effect. The phosphorylation
of Akt and mTOR was assessed by Western blotting and
immunohistochemical assays in BNL tumors harvested at
8 days after initiation of treatment. Combined treatment
with RT and BKM120 suppressed levels of radiationactivated Akt and mTOR in tumor tissues (Fig. 5A and
5B). In addition, immunohistochemical and Western blot
evaluations of apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase-3) revealed
that the combination treatment induced apoptosis in
xenograft tumors (Fig. 5A and 5B).
Taken together, the results indicate that BKM120
radiosensitizes BNL cells in vitro and in vivo, and suggest
that radiosensitization occurs through the inhibition of the
radiation-activated PI3K/Akt pathway.

complexes have been identified: rapamycin-sensitive
mTOR complex (mTORC1; containing raptor) and
rapamycin-insensitive complex (mTORC2; containing
rictor). mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at S473, a key
regulator of cell survival. BKM120 did not totally inhibit
the phosphorylation of mTOR and phospho-S6 kinase
after radiation (Fig. 6A). The treatment of rapamycin
partially reduced the levels of mTOR and phospho-S6
kinase (Fig. 6A). Notably, combined BKM120 and
rapamycin suppressed the radiation-induced Akt and
the phosphorylations of its downstream signaling
components mTOR and S6 kinase more than BKM120
alone, and further increased caspase-3 activation (Fig.
6B). Irradiated BNL cells pretreated with BKM120 (1
μM) and/or rapamycin (100 nM) were lysed in RIPA
lysis buffer, and 500 μg of each lysate was subjected
to immunoprecipitation with the mTOR antibody.
The amounts of mTOR, rictor, and raptor in mTOR
immunoprecipitates were analyzed on immunoblots.
By immunoprecipitation, radiation alone suppressed the
forms of mTORC2 while BKM120 induced the binding
of mTOR and rictor in irradiated BNL cells. Rapamycin
inhibited the assembly of mTOR/raptor and mTOR/rictor
more than BKM120 alone (Fig. 6C). Thus, we show that
inhibition of the assembly of mTOR/rictor by rapamycin
may enhance the radiosensitization of BNL cells by
BKM120. By combining rapamycin (10 nM) with lowdose BKM120 (50 nM and 100 nM) and irradiation, the
clonogenic survivals were similar to those by higher-dose
BKM120 (250 nM and 500 nM) and irradiation (Fig. 6D).
It is likely that the combined inhibition of PI3K/mTOR
pathways with irradiation will have synergistic effects at
the level of apoptosis, via effects upon mTOR complexes
formation, as well as through increased activation of Akt
(Fig. 6E).

DISCUSSION

[3]. To increase safety and reduce side effects of RT,
pharmacological radiosensitization has been increased by
using it in combination with medicinal compounds.
Unregulated signaling through the PI3K pathway
is linked to the development of certain types of cancer
including HCC [6, 18, 19]. In recent clinical study reports,
activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways
is correlated with tumor progression and worse survival of

HCC is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide,
and few curative options are available to patients with
advanced disease. The increasing use and improved
technology of RT have gradually established it as an
alternative treatment regimen [17]. Partial regression
is the most common sublethal response of HCC to RT

patients [20, 21]. The frequent overexpression of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway in HCC is believed to contribute to
its aggressive phenotype [22]. Recent study also showed
that co-targeting mTOR and MEK may be effective in
patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
[23]. Uncontrolled signaling through the PI3K pathway
may be a critical target for therapeutic intervention. Thus,
the inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway would
have potentially significant anticancer effects. Many of
the PI3K inhibitors currently in pre-clinical or clinical
development inhibit all of the catalytic subunit isoforms
of class IA PI3Ks [24, 25]. BKM120 is a newly developed
oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor which selectively inhibits
PI3Kα, β, γ, and δ and mutated PI3K. BKM120 has been
shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and to induce
cell death in several cancer cell lines [26, 27]. It had
been studied and had promising results in patients with
advanced solid tumor in a phase I study [14]. Our preclinical study similarly demonstrated that treatment with
BKM120 enhanced the effect of RT by inhibiting RT-

induced Akt phosphorylation of HCC cells.
RT-induced Akt activation is a common mediator
of cell survival signals through multiple intracellular
signaling pathways including PI3K [28, 29]. Several
studies have shown that the activation of PI3K/Akt
survival pathway is associated with radioresistance in
many cancer cell lines [30-32]. Use of the corresponding
PI3K inhibitor is a reasonable solution to this problem.
Studies on PI3K inhibition in other human cancer cell lines
have shown that the nonselective PI3K inhibitors, such as
LY294002 and wortmannin, have radiosensitizing effects
and induce cell apoptosis [33, 34]. In the present study,
we explored the anticancer effects of BKM120 against
RT-treated HCC cells. As expected, BKM120 dosedependently inhibited the RT-induced phosphorylation
of Akt, effectively suppressed the PI3K/Akt signaling
activated by irradiation, and thereby induced apoptosis in
RT-treated HCC cells.
The formation of γ-H2AX foci increases the local
concentration of repair proteins and facilitates repair of

DSBs [35]. Akt phosphorylation has been reported to
mediate DNA damage repair, and treatment with an Akt
inhibitor has been reported to suppress DNA-DSB repair
through modulating the phosphorylation of the DNAprotein kinase catalytic subunit [36]. Here we showed
the potential mechanism for radiosensitization by a PI3K
inhibitor through the disruption of the DNA damage
repair process. We found that down-regulation of PI3K/
Akt signaling by the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 led to the
persistence of unrepaired double strand DNA damage by
irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report to
clearly characterize BKM120 as a radiosensitizer and its
mechanism in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft models.
The PDK1–Akt (Thr308) axis controls TSC2
phosphorylation, which activates mTORC1 and
subsequently S6K1 with feedback mechanism on Akt
phosphorylation [37]. It was reported that radiation
induced Thr308 Akt phosphorylation in the livers of both
p53 wild-type and knockout mice. However, radiation
decreased phospho-S6 kinase in the livers of p53 wildtype mice, and had the negative effect of p53 on mTOR
[38]. Radiation induced tumor suppressor p53 is involved
in the complex response to radiation, including cell cycle
regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis [39, 40]. Inhibition
of mTOR by p53 is partially involved in the suppressed
cellular senescence, and converts it into quiescence [4143]. Here we showed that a combination of the PI3K
inhibitor BKM and rapamycin acts synergistically to
induce cell death after radiation treatment (Figure 6B). The
activation of p53 after the combination of irradiation and
sensitizers may be important in the regulation of mTOR
on Akt [44, 45]. Further investigations are warranted
to determine the exact mechanism by which PI3K/Akt/
mTOR and p53/mTOR signaling cascades become
activated in radiation treated tumors.
BKM120 does not bind to the Ser774 residue
of PI3K; such binding was proposed as important and
effective in mTOR inhibition [46]. mTOR can affect PI3K/
Akt signaling through the S6K-IRS1 feedback loop and
the induction of Akt phosphorylation by mTORC2 [47,
48]. Such compensation limits the therapeutic effect of
single-pathway mTOR inhibitors. Agents such as BEZ235
(Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) and EX147 (Exelixis, San
Francisco, CA) are dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and
thus may suppress the feedback loops. Rapamycin was
originally thought to only inhibit mTORC1. However, it
has been recently shown that the long-term rapamycin
treatment also suppresses mTORC2 activity [49]. In this
study, BKM120 slightly reduced the phosphorylation
of mTOR at the Ser2448 residue, which regulates the
binding of raptor and rictor to mTOR [50], and inhibitors
of both PI3K and mTOR blocked Akt phosphorylation
more completely, which resulted in improved radiation
sensitization in HCC cells. The radiosensitizing effect
of dual inhibition was better than that of PI3K inhibition
alone. These data indicate that inhibition of both PI3K and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTOR might prevent PI3K feedback signaling and further
enhance radiation-induced cell killing.
In conclusion, in the in vitro HCC cell models
and in vivo ectopic tumor model, we demonstrated
the radiosensitizing activity of BKM120, an orally
bioavailable PI3K inhibitor. BKM120 mediates its effect
on HCC cells by inhibiting radiation-activated PI3K/
Akt signals, thereby causing enhanced cell apoptosis and
DNA damage. The addition of mTOR inhibitor further
increases the radiosensitivity of BKM120-treated HCC
cells. The findings may have clinical implications for the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HCC cell lines
Human HCC cell line Huh7 was obtained from
JCRB cell bank (Okayama, Japan) and the murine HCC
cell line, BNL, was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were
cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2
and 95% air.

Reagents
BKM120 was provided by Novartis (Basel,
Switzerland). For in vitro studies, stock solutions of
BKM120 were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and diluted in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum. For in vivo studies, BKM120 was suspended
in a vehicle (NMP/PEG300 [10:90, v/v]) for oral
administration to Balb/c mice bearing xenograft tumors.

Irradiation of cells
HCC cells in culture flasks were irradiated with
different doses of radiation, using a Primus 6-MV photon
linear accelerator (Siemens Oncology Medical Systems,
Inc., Concord, CA, USA). The distance from the radiation
source to the bottom of the flask was set at 100 cm.

Colony formation assay
Cells (500/well) were seeded in six-well plates and
treated with different doses of radiation (0 Gy–10 Gy
for Huh7 cells and 0 Gy–5 Gy for BNL cells) following
one-hour pretreatment with various doses of BKM120
(0.25–1 μM) or DMSO vehicle. Cells were then cultured
for an additional 7 days, after which the number of
colonies (clusters of more than 50 cells) was counted in

each well using an inverted phase-contrast microscope
at 100X magnification and photographed. The effect on
colony number was analyzed using CompuSyn software
(ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA). The combination
index (CI) was calculated by the Chou-Talalay equation
(Chou TC, Talalay P. Trends Pharmacol Sci 1983;4:450454). The general equation for the classic isobologram
(CI=1) is given by: CI=(D)1/(Dx)1+(D)2/(Dx)2 (A) where
(Dx)1 and (Dx)2 in the denominators are the doses (or
concentrations) of D1 (drug #1) and D2 (drug #2) alone
that gives x% inhibition, whereas (D)1 and (D)2 in the
numerators are the doses of D1 and D2 in combination
that also inhibits x% (isoeffective). The (Dx)1 and (Dx)2
can be readily calculated from the Median-effect equation:
Dx=Dm [fa/(1-fa)]1/m (B) where Dx is the median effect
dose obtained from the anti-log of the X-intercept of the
median-effect plot, X-log (D) versus, Y=log[fa/(1-fa)] ,
or Dm=10(Y-intercept)/m, fa is the fraction affected by
dose D and m is the slope of the median-effect plot. From
(Dm)1, and (Dx)2 and D1+D2, an isobologram can be
constructed based on Eq. A: as CI<1 indicates synergism,
CI=1 indicates an additive effect, and CI>1 indicates
antagonism.

Huh7 and BNL cells were plated on 4-well
chamber slides, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed
to ionizing irradiation of 10 Gy or 5 Gy either alone or
combined with 1 μM of BKM120. After treatment, Huh7
cells were incubated for 30 minutes, 4, 6, and 8 hours,
BNL cells were incubated for 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 4
hours, washed three times with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS
for 30 minutes, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in
PBS for 30 minutes, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin
for 1 hour at room temperature, incubated with the
antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-conjugated
anti-phospho-histone γH2AX [Ser139; 1:500; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA]) for 16 hours at 4.C in the dark,
washed with PBS, and mounted in Vectashield mounting
medium containing diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). γ-H2AX foci were
examined using a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 fluorescence
microscope. In each sample, the number of γ-H2AX foci
per nucleus was counted using an automated foci counter
under high power field, and an average of 150 nuclei were
analyzed. The average number of γ-H2AX foci per nucleus
represents the amount of double strand breaks (DSB).

Western blot analysis
The proteins (50 μg of protein/aliquot) in aliquots
of cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 8–15%
polyacrylamide), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes, and immunoblotted with various
antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using
appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies
followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,
Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Antibodies
to phospho-Akt and phospho-mTOR were obtained from
Cell Signaling, Inc. (Burlingame, CA, USA), phosphoAkt (Ser473 and Thr308) and phospho-mTOR (Ser2448),
phosphor-p70 S6 kinase (Thr389) and caspase-3 from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), S6 and
beta-actin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), and phospho-H2AX (Ser139) from Millipore
Corporation (Billerica, MA, USA). Beta-actin was used as
the loading control.

weights were measured weekly. Ectopic tumors were
established by subcutaneous injection of BNL cells (1
x 106) into the right hind leg of mice. Tumor volumes
were measured with a set of calipers and calculated using
a standard formula: width2×length/2. All experimental
procedures using these mice were performed in
accordance with protocols approved by the National

Whole protein lysates containing 500 μg of protein
were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated at room
temperature for 2 h using the Catch and Release v2.0
Reversible Immunoprecipitation System (Millipore).
mTOR was immunoprecipitated with primary antibody
diluted 1:100 in a total volume of 500 μl. Protein
complexes were eluted from the column using 70 μl of
1× denaturing elution buffer in accordance with the
manufacturer’s directions. About 30 μl of eluted proteins
was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 8% resolving gel,
transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed overnight
with primary antibodies to mTOR, rictor, and raptor.

In vivo ectopic tumor model

Apoptotic cells were detected using the annexin
V/FITC apoptosis detection kit (AVK050, Strong
Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The annexin V-positive cells were examined
using a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 fluorescence microscope.

As the tumors became established (mean starting
tumor volume =147 mm3), the mice were randomized
into 6 groups to receive the following treatments: (1)
methylcellulose/Tween 80 vehicle; (2) BKM120 (30 mg/
kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day of body weight) on day 1–7; (3)
methylcellulose/Tween 80 vehicle plus 7 Gy/day of RT on
day 3–5; (4) BKM120 (30 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day of
body weight) plus RT (7 Gy/day). Small animal positron
emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
scans with [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) were
performed one day before and on day 8 of treatment. The
mice were intravenously injected with 14 MBq (378 Ci)
of 18FDG in saline via the tail vein.

Mice from each group were sacrificed on day 8. The
tumor was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
processed for histopathological and immunohistochemical
staining as well as Western blot assay. After fixation, tumor
tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks and sectioned (5
µm). Tumor cells were detected in representative stained
sections. The expressions of phospho-Akt and phosphomTOR were evaluated after immunohistochemical
staining using specific antibodies. DNA fragmentation
was assessed using the DeadEnd Colorimetric Apoptosis
Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Tissue
sections were deparaffinized by immersing slides in fresh
xylene, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols, and
subjected to the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–
mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay
following instructions of the manufacturer. Nucleotide
incorporation was detected by treatment with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated streptavidin and enzyme substrate.

The tumor volume data satisfied the assumptions
of normality and homogeneity of variance for the use of
parametric analysis; thus, group means for the ectopic
tumor models were compared with a one-way analysis of
variance followed by Fisher’s least significant difference
method for multiple comparisons. Differences were
considered significant at P < 0.05.
