ABSTRACT
This trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety between epirubicin
(E) and carboplatin (C) in combination with paclitaxel (P) and trastuzumab (H) in
neoadjuvant setting. In 13 Chinese cancer centers, 100 patients with HER2-positive,
locally advanced breast cancer were 1:1 randomized to receive medication as follows:
trastuzumab and paclitaxel weekly combined with carboplatin weekly for PCH group,
or epirubicin every 3 weeks for PEH group. Patients were given 4 to 6 cycles of
chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate,
which was no significant difference in PCH and PEH regimen (39.1% vs. 48.8%;
p=0.365). However, PEH regimen achieved higher pCR in luminal-B (HER2-poitive)
subgroup (55.0% vs. 24.0%; p = 0.033), but not in ERBB2+ subgroup (42.9% vs.
57.1%; p = 0.355). PEH regimen showed a favorable efficacy in PIK3CA mutated
subgroup (69.2% vs.23.5%, p=0.012). No significant difference was observed in
the subgroup analysis of TP53 mutation status, PTEN expression, FCGR2A SNP and
FCGR3A SNP. Both regimens as neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieve similar efficacy

and safety. PEH might improve pCR rate, especially in the luminal-B subtype and
PIK3CA mutation subtype. PEH is feasible and less likely to increase the incidence of
acute cardiac events compared to PCH.

INTRODUCTION

(Table1). Three patients in PCH and 7 patients in PEH
group did not complete at least 4 cycles chemotherapy
because of AE, disease progression, withdrawal of consent
or immediate surgery. After completing at least 4 cycles
chemotherapy, 1 patient in PCH and 2 patients in PEH
withdrew from this clinical trial. As predefined in the
protocol, these patients were excluded from the analysis.
In whole cohort, median age was 48 years (range 2965 years), 61 patients were premenopausal. 49 patients
presented with clinical TNM stage II and 51 patients with
stage III. 45 patients were ER positive and 37 patients
were PR positive. The cut-off value of Ki67 was 14%,
79 patients expressed high level of Ki67. All patients had
LVEF over 55% and the median was 66% (range 56.5%83%).

Neoadjuvant therapy has emerged as a successful
approach to convert patients that are inoperable at
diagnosis to operable, or to make breast conserving
surgery possible instead of mastectomy. A pathologic
complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy is
a surrogate of excellent outcome of human epidermal
growth hormone receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer
[1]. Over the past few years, a large number of clinical
trials have been conducted in neoadjuvant setting, in an
attempt to further refine therapeutic strategies for patients
with breast cancer. Such trials have typically aimed at
selecting the better regimen for each subtype, optimizing
dosage of each reagent, different sequences of similar
combinations of reagents, different time intervals of drug
administration, and exploring the role of novel reagents.
In a pilot study, anthracycline and paclitaxel
combined with trastuzumab showed promising efficacy
in patients with metastatic disease, which did not cause
any symptomatic cardiac dysfunction [2]. In the pretrastuzumab era, Stearns et al. showed in a small group
of patients with HER2-positive tumors that the likelihood
of achieving clinical complete response was higher after
anthracyclines than after taxanes treatment [3]. Relatively
little attention has been paid to the concurrent combination
of anthracyclines and taxanes in trastuzumab-based
regimens in neoadjuvant treatment. A few trials examined
carboplatin in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer or
in neoadjuvant setting, but the results were controversial
[4-7]. Therefore, we designed this clinical trial to compare
efficacy and safety between anthracycline and carboplatin,
when combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab. Our
primary objective was to compare the pCR rates between
the two treatment groups. Secondary endpoints included
clinical response and safety analysis. In addition, we did
an explorative analysis to identify potentially targetable
genetic alterations that are associated with resistance to
the regimens investigated in this study.

Efficacy and responses
Over 90% of the patients experienced a clinical
objective response (CR or PR) assessed by palpation,
ultrasonography and/or MRI. After 2 cycles and 4 cycles,
the overall clinical response did not differ between two
cohorts (Table 2). During the treatment, one patient in
PEH group had tumor progress. Two patients in both
cohorts underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS). 18
(39.1%) of 46 patients in the PCH group and 20 (48.8%)
of 41 patients in the PEH group achieved pCR (ypT0/
is, ypN0; OR 1.48 95%CI 0.63-3.47; p = 0.365).No
significant difference was noted when other definitions
of pCR (ypT0/is, ypN0/+) were used. Based on Miller
& Payne grade, no significant difference in tumor
regression was observed in both cohorts (p = 0.43).
Performing subgroup analysis of patients in the PCH
group, 13 (54.2%) of 24 patients who received 5/6 cycles
of PCH achieved pCR, while 5 (22.7%) of 22 patients
who received 4 cycles had pCR (p = 0.029). Whereas in
PEH group, subgroup analysis revealed no significant
difference in pCR rate in patients who were given different
number of cycles of PEH (56.5% vs. 38.9%, p = 0.262).
Univariate analysis for clinical characteristics predicting
pCR was performed in whole patient population (S.Table
1), revealing no significant predictor for pCR. However,
chemotherapy regimen (PCH vs. PEH) was found to be
an independent factor associated with pCR in multivariate
analysis (OR: 3.606, 95%CI: 1.153-11.274, p = 0.027).
Figure2 showed the odd ratio (OR) of achieving pCR
comparing PCH versus PEH with different characteristics.
The results of this analysis revealed that treating patients
with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer with
PEH regimen had a significantly higher chance to achieve
pCR compared with PCH regimen (OR: 3.87, 95%CI:

1.09-13.81, p = 0.033). For patients receiving 4 cycles
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, treatment of PEH also
significantly increased chance of achieving pCR compared
with PCH treatment(OR: 4.42, 95%CI: 1.21-16.12, p =
0.021).
Safety and toxicity Most adverse events were of
grades 1-2 (S. Table 2). The most frequently occurring
grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia and
granulocytopenia. The incidence of febrile neutropenia
was 8% in PCH group and 14% in PEH group. PEH
regimen caused higher frequency of grade 3/4 leucopenia
than PCH regimen (26% vs 8%, p = 0.017). Nausea,
vomiting and fatigue were the most frequent nonhematological toxic effects, but these cases were mostly
mild or moderate. Symptomatic congestive cardiac failure
was not observed. 4 patients in PCH group and 5 patients
in PEH group were admitted to hospital for treatmentrelated toxicities. No treatment-related death occurred.
S.Figure 2 showed LVEF at baseline, and during
neoadjuvant treatment after 2 and 4 cycles. All patients
in both groups maintained normal LVEF throughout
the study. After 2 cycles, over 10% reduction of LVEF
was observed in 5 patients (11.9%) in PCH group and
3 patients (7.7%) in PEH group, while it was 3 patients
(7.3%) in PCH group and 1 patient (2.7%) in PEH group
had over 10% LVEF reduction after 4 cycles. No patient

had LVEF decrease to less than 50% at any time during
the study. None of the patients receiving chemotherapy
developed cardiac failure and there were no chemotherapy
discontinuation due to cardiac toxicity.

Biomarker analysis
PIK3CA mutation was detected In 30 (39.0%) out
of 77 tumor samples available, which were balanced
between HR-positive and HR-negative tumors (46.3%
vs. 30.5%, p = 0.156). The presence of PIK3CA mutation
was not significantly associated with lower pCR rate.
43.3% of patients with PIK3CA-mutant tumors achieved
pCR compared with 48.8% in the wild-type subgroup
(OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.316 to 2.024; p = 0.637) (Table
3). Based on PI3KCA mutation status analysis, there
is no statistically significant difference in efficacy to
PIK3CA wide type tumors between PEH and PCH group
(p = 0.884). However, PEH regimen showed a favorable
efficacy in patients with PIK3CA mutation (69.2%
vs.23.5%, p = 0.012).
In this data set, the frequency of FCGR2A
polymorphism at amino-acid 131 was 36 H/H (46.8 %),
36 H/R (46.8 %), and 5R/R (6.4 %). The frequency of
FCGR3A polymorphism at amino-acid 158 was 39 F/F

(50.6 %), 37 F/V (48.5 %), and 1 V/V (1.3 %). The two
gene SNPs were not correlated with pCR rate. Distribution
of the HER2 mutation (A763T and T862A) was 2 (2.6 %),
both of which did not achieved pCR. TP53 mutations in
exon 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 were detected in 32 (41.6%) patients,
while 20 (22.2%) patients had PTEN loss. These potential
biomarkers were not statistically significantly associated
with pCR in the whole cohort and subgroup analyses.

anthracyclines and trastuzumab resulted in an unacceptably
high rate (27%) of cardiotoxicity [20]. However, emerging
evidence have showed that concurrent use of trastuzumab
and anthracycline may not be associated with LVEF
dysfunction. When trastuzumab was given concurrently
with paclitaxel after completion of doxorubicin in adjuvant
setting, the incidence of symptomatic cardiac failure
was 2.8%-4.1% [21, 22]. In the monitoring of cardiac
function under strict application, low cumulative dosage of
anthracycline combined with trastuzumab may cause low
occurrence of cardiac function failure. Despite concurrent
use of doxorubicin, paclitaxel and trastuzumab in the
NOAH trial, incidence of left ventricular dysfunction was
less than 2%. In the GeparQuattro trial, only one patient
treated with concurrent administration of trastuzumab
with epirubicin reported persistent decrease in LVEF to
less than 50% [23]. Additionally, the concurrent group in
Z1041 trial showed that concurrent use of trastuzumab and
anthracycline was not associated with an increased risk
of cardiac dysfunction [12]. Consistently, no patient had
LVEF decrease to less than 50% at any time during our
study. Our results support the notion that trastuzumab can
be given concurrently with anthracycline with low cardiac
toxicity.
PIK3CA mutation in HER2-positive tumors, leading
to PI3K pathway irregulation, has been shown to be
important in developing resistance to trastuzumab [24].
PIK3CA mutation has been reported in approximately 20%
to 30% of HER2-positive tumors by sanger sequencing of
mutation hot spots [25-27]. In this study, next generation
sequencing was used to detect mutations in exon4, 9, 20
of PIK3CA with detection sensitivity of 1% mutated cells.
In the HER2-positive population enrolled in this study,
our results showed that HR positive and HR negative
tumors had similar PIK3CA mutation frequencies, which
is consistent to previous pooled analysis [25]. In the
neoadjuvant GepaSixto study, the presence of PIK3CA
mutation was significantly associated with lower pCR rate,
especially in the HR positive population. However, in the
Geparquattro and GeparQuinto studies using anti-HER2
therapy, pCR rate was not significantly associated with
PIK3CA mutation and HR status, which agreed with our
results [25]. A retrospective study suggested that PIK3CA
mutation status may be a predictor for clinical response
of the combination regimen of epirubicin and docetaxel
in neoadjuvant setting [28]. Comparing PCH with PEH
in this study, our results indicated that PIK3CA mutation
may be a potential predictor of clinical outcome for PEH
regimen.
The TP53 gene is a prime candidate for predicting
the response of tumors to classic chemotherapy, however
other trials did not confirmed the conclusion [29]. In
other studies, the TP53 mutation rate was between 2050% in HER2 overexpressing subtype, which is similar
to our results [27, 30]. Previous retrospective studies
investigating the correlation of FCGR3A/2A genotypes

DISCUSSION
In this clinical trial, there was no significant
difference on pCR rate between two groups. In HR+
subgroup and PIK3CA mutation subgroup, the PEH
regimen could bring higher therapeutic benefit. Within
the HER2-positive population, chances of achieving
pCR was more common for patients with HR negative
tumor than with HR positive tumor [8, 10, 11]. Our
results showed that PEH improved the pCR rate in HR
positive subtype. Few studies have evaluated concurrent
administration of anthracycline-based chemotherapy and
trastuzumab in neoadjuvant setting [7, 12, 13]. In contrast
to previous reports, anthracycline followed by taxanes
with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant treatment was both
effective and well tolerated [14, 15].
The biological rationale for our conclusions was
based on limited preclinical and clinical observations.
ER negative subtype is sensitive for chemotherapy and
trastuzumab, different combinations of agents may
achieve similar high pCR rate. Active agents and different
regimen may improve the efficacy in luminal-B (HER2positive) subtype [6, 8, 9, 12]. Results of the GeparSixto
study showed an increase of the pCR rate from 37.2%
to 46.7% by the addition of carboplatin. An absolute
increase by > 20% was observed in patients with TNBC
(37.9% vs. 58.7%), but no increase in patients with HER2positive breast cancer (36.3% vs. 33.1%) [7]. It is possible
that carboplatin and docetaxel-induced senescence may
render cells resistant to further therapies [16, 17]. In a
retrospective study of 300 patients, PH-FECH (paclitaxel
and trastuzumab and FEC75) shows a higher pCR rate
and recurrence-free survival (RFS) advantage than TCH
(docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab) [13]. Previous
work has shown that activation of the HER family of
receptors is associated with up regulation of Topo-IIÎ±
and increase in sensitivity to doxorubicin [18]. 30% of
HER2-potitive breast cancer express p95HER2, which is
resistant to trastuzumab. However doxorubicin sensitized
p95HER2 to trastuzumab in patient-derived xenografts
[19]. Therefore, it is conceivable that, in HR positive and
HER2 positive subgroups, which are less responsive to
chemotherapy and targeted therapy, concurrently adding
anthracycline may lead to additional benefit in our study.
The treatment benefits need to be weighed against
the risk of cardiotoxicity. In a pivotal phase III trial in
metastatic breast cancer, the concurrent administration of

with clinical outcome to trastuzumab-based therapy
yielded discordant results [31-33]. Our study did not
show a correlation between FCGR3A-V/F and FCGR2AH/R SNPs and pCR in patients treated with trastuzumab.
While preclinical studies have shown that PTEN loss may
contribute to trastuzumab resistance, previous clinical
studies have failed to give us a clear answer [34-36].
From the results of this study, both PCH and PEH
are suitable options for patients with locally advanced,
HER2-positive breast cancer. Results of exploratory
analysis implied that HR+ and PIK3CA mutation might
be a positive predictor for PEH treatment outcome.
Our results confirmed earlier findings that concurrent
administration of trastuzumab and anthracycline is not
associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction.
However, our study may be limited by its small sample
size, which is underpowered for the subgroup analysis.
Although trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy
remains the standard of care, dual HER2-blockade
strategies have significantly improve pCR rate [8, 37].
The final survival results of the neoadjuvant trials using
dual HER2 inhibition may help elucidate the final role
of this approach for early stage disease. It remains to be
determined whether the differences in outcomes between
the groups in this trial were the result of the antitumor
effect of anthracycline, or synergy from the combination
of anthracyclines, paclitaxel with trastuzumab.
Understanding the mechanism that underlies sensitivity
and resistance to various reagents will help investigators
develop rational combinations and sequences of drugs to
further improve clinical outcome [38]. Future randomized
studies with larger prospective cohorts and longer term
follow-up are needed to validate these findings.

Procedures
Randomization was done centrally at the operation
office with sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
envelopes. The treatment plan is illustrated in S.Figure
1. Trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2
mg/kg) and paclitaxel (75 mg/m2) weekly combined
with carboplatin (AUC = 2) weekly for PCH group or
epirubicin (75 mg/m2) every 3 weeks for PEH group.
Patients were given at least 4 cycles but no more than
6 cycles under discretion of physicians, which were
common accepted cycles in concurrent neoadjuvant
regimens [8, 9]. Breast surgery with axillary dissection or
breast conserving surgery was performed 2â€“4 weeks after
the last chemotherapy dose. Surgery type was decided
at the surgeonâ€™s discretion. Chemotherapy regimen was
at the doctorsâ€™ discretion and began within 4 weeks
postoperatively. One year of trastuzumab in total was
recommended for all patients. Patients with estrogen or
progesterone receptor-positive disease received endocrine
treatment based on National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) guideline.

Assessment

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment of
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
HER2 expression, Ki67, PTEN was conducted in paraffinembedded tumor samples biopsied before neoadjuvant
treatment according to the guidelines from the American
Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American
Pathologists. HER2 positivity was determined by IHC
3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive
status. The clinical response in the breast was assessed
using a breast MRI, mammogram or ultrasound after every
two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and categorized
as a clinical complete response, partial response, stable
disease, and progressive disease according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version
1.1. pCR in the breast was defined as the disappearance
of residual invasive disease (residual ductal carcinoma
in situ allowed) by pathologic examination, and pCR in
the axilla was assessed as the absence of positive lymph
nodes by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The independent
pathological review committee included 4 senior
pathologists, who did not belong to the 13 participating

pCR in the breast and axilla. Toxicity was evaluated at
every cycle and recorded according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
version 4.0.
Gene mutations were evaluated in tumor samples
from FFPE core biopsies taken before therapy with a
tumor content more than 50% determined by using next
generation deep Ion DNA AmpliSeqTM (Average depth
of coverage = 1000Ã—, Life Technologies). Hot-spot
mutations were detected in whole exon 4th, 9th and 20th of
PI3KCA, exon 5th-8th exon of TP53, exon 19th-25thexon
of HER2. DNA was purified from whole blood samples
using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, CA),
and detected by PCR amplification and classical Sanger
sequencing of regions containing the FCGR3A 158 V/F
and FCGR2A 131 H/R SNPs.

trastuzumab with docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab
as first-line chemotherapy for patients with HER2-geneamplified metastatic breast cancer (BCIRG 007 study): two
highly active therapeutic regimens. J Clin Oncol. 2011;
29:149-156.

Patients` tumor characteristics and adverse events
were summarized by descriptive statistics. Treatment
groups were compared by continuity corrected two-sided
Pearsonâ€™s Ï‡2 test or Fisherâ€™s exact test where appropriate.
The response rates and odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Univariate
logistic regression was used in subgroup analyses, while
interaction effects were also displayed using forest plots. A
multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for the
baseline factors. All P values were two-sided and a P value
of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.12.0 and
STATA v.11.0.
