BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor effect of everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in combination
with sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: Sequential cohorts of patients received escalating doses of everolimus and sorafenib in 28-day cycles in the absence of
a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or disease progression were examined. RESULTS: Twenty patients with a median age of
65 years received therapy in 3 cohorts. Dose level 1 was comprised of everolimus at a dose of 2.5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (6 patients), dose level 2 was comprised of everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily
and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (8 patients), and dose level 3 was comprised of everolimus at a dose
of 10 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 200 mg twice daily (6 patients). DLTs included grade 4 (according to
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]) hyperuricemia with grade 2
gout and grade 3 lipase associated with grade 2 pancreatitis at dose level 2, and grade 3 rash in 2 patients at dose
level 3. Dose level 2 (everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment-related adverse events occurring in >20% of patients included
diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, hypophosphatemia, hypothyroidism, and rash. Five of 20 patients
achieved Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined partial responses, all of which occurred in
patients without a history of prior systemic therapy. Seven of 8 patients treated at dose level 2 experienced
a partial response or stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no interaction between everolimus and
sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of everolimus and sorafenib was associated with acceptable toxicity
and evidence of antitumor activity in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Cancer

Agents targeting angiogenesis and neovascularization (bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib) have shown
activity in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).1-5 These agents target the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) pathway to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration in the growing tumor. Sorafenib inhibits
both the VEGF receptor and Raf kinase, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation, as well as several
other receptor tyrosine kinases (platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-b, fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [Flt3],
and c-kit). Phase 3 data have demonstrated that 74% of patients with metastatic RCC exhibit some degree of tumor
shrinkage when treated with sorafenib, and the majority of patients experience prolonged stabilization of disease. Compared with placebo, sorafenib is associated with a significantly prolonged time to disease progression (24 weeks vs 12
weeks; P <.001).3 Based on these data, sorafenib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of advanced RCC in December 2005.

Everolimus and Sorafenib for Kidney Cancer/Harzstark et al

However, VEGF inhibition alone, which primarily
targets endothelial cells, may not be sufficient as an anticancer strategy in patients with advanced RCC. Loss of
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) function
because of methylation is common in metastatic kidney
cancer, leading to increased Akt activity and cell proliferation.6,7 Akt pathway activation stimulates VEGF production through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a–
dependent mechanisms.7 Inhibition of mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream effector of these
critical cell regulatory pathways, has been shown in preclinical models to decrease tumor cell proliferation and inhibit angiogenesis. Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of
mTOR, decreases tumor and endothelial cell proliferation
and tumor cell VEGF production, leading to antitumor
and antiangiogenic effects.
Everolimus at a dose of 10 mg daily or placebo was
evaluated in 410 patients with metastatic RCC who had
developed disease progression during treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both.8 The primary endpoint was progression-free survival using an intent-to-treat analysis.
Final results indicated a significantly better median progression-free survival of 4.0 months with everolimus versus 1.9 months with placebo. In March 2009, the US
FDA approved everolimus for the treatment of metastatic
RCC that has progressed after use of a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor.
There is strong biologic rationale for combining
VEGF receptor blockade with mTOR inhibition in the
treatment of patients with metastatic RCC. Downstream
signal transduction inhibition of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR
pathway by everolimus may complement upstream
VEGF receptor inhibition by either simple additive effects
when both targets are inhibited or by downstream blockade of pathways if there is partial resistance to receptor inhibition. Combining everolimus with angiogenesis
inhibitors in preclinical studies has led to synergistic antiangiogenic and antitumor effects.9 The preclinical evidence of synergy between these anti-VEGF and antimTOR drugs provided the rationale to undertake a phase
1 study of everolimus in combination with sorafenib in
patients with metastatic RCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients with metastatic, histologically confirmed RCC
with a clear cell component were eligible for inclusion
into the current study. Patients were aged >18 years, had

(RECIST)-defined measurable disease, were using effective contraception, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. Adequate bone
marrow, liver, and renal function was required (hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, an absolute neutrophil count 1500/uL,
platelet count 100,000/uL, total bilirubin 1.5 times
the upper limit of normal [ULN], aspartate aminotransferase [serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase] 2.5
times the ULN, alanine aminotransferase [serum glutamic
pyruvic transaminase] 2.5 times the ULN, and measured or calculated [using the Cockcroft-Gault equation]
creatinine clearance 40 mL/min or serum creatinine
1.5 times the ULN), and total cholesterol was required
to be 300 mg/dL. Resolution of any pre-existing toxicity
from prior therapy to below National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE; version 3.0) grade 1 was required.
Patients were excluded for any of the following: collecting duct, papillary, or chromophobe-type histology
without a clear cell component; >2 prior systemic regimens for RCC; prior everolimus or sorafenib therapy; surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy for RCC
administered within 4 weeks of the initiation of study
therapy; known brain metastasis, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis; or evidence of brain or
leptomeningeal disease on screening computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan. Patients were
also excluded for prior myocardial infarction; unstable or
severe angina; coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft;
New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV congestive
heart failure; cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack; or pulmonary embolism occurring within 12
months before study entry. In addition, hypertension that
could not be controlled with medication was an exclusion
criterion, as was the need for chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents or a
history of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Patients with an active bleeding diathesis or those requiring systemic anticoagulation with warfarin were excluded.
Patients receiving low-dose warfarin for maintenance of
venous access devices and patients receiving other forms
of systemic anticoagulation were eligible.
All patients provided written, informed consent in
accordance with federal and institutional guidelines.
Documented approval from appropriate Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards was obtained, and
the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study Design
Patients initiated sorafenib therapy 7 days before starting
everolimus as a run-in period during cycle 1 to determine
the pharmacokinetic effect of adding everolimus on sorafenib drug levels. Starting doses were everolimus at a dose
of 2.5 mg orally daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg
orally twice daily continuously. Cycle length was 4 weeks.
Three different dose levels of everolimus were planned:
2.5 mg daily, 5 mg daily, and 10 mg daily (Table 1). This
dosing combination was used because at the time the current study was initiated, sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg
orally twice daily was the FDA-approved dose, and everolimus was not yet approved. In this way, there was certainty that even at the lowest dose level, the appropriate
dose was being used for an FDA-approved agent. Once
everolimus was granted FDA approval (with a recommended dose of 10 mg orally daily), dose level 3 was revised to be comprised of sorafenib at a dose of 200 mg
orally twice daily and everolimus at a dose of 10 mg orally
daily. A standard 3 þ 3 dose escalation design was used,
and if, in any cohort, 2 of 6 patients experienced a doselimiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was determined to have been exceeded.
DLTs were defined as grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity (but excluded vomiting controlled with antiemetics, grade 3 hypertension that resolved to 150/100 mm
Hg within 7 days of adjustment of oral antihypertensives,
or asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 hypophosphatemia).
Hypertension requiring admission to the hospital or intravenous medication for control was defined as a DLT. A
DLT was also defined as treatment emergent hematologic
toxicity comprised of grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade
3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, and grade 4 neutropenia that persisted for >7 days or was associated with fever
>38.5 C. Lymphopenia or anemia of any grade was
excluded as a DLT.
Patients who experienced a toxicity of grade 3 or
higher that was related to treatment had both their everolimus and sorafenib doses reduced by half. Dose re-escalation was allowed at the discretion of the investigator if
toxicity recovered to below grade 2 within 4 weeks.
Patients were removed from protocol therapy if both

4196

agents were dose-reduced more than twice. For treatment
emergent toxicities of grade 3 or higher (hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and anemia were excluded), therapy was withheld until resolution
to grade 1 or lower. Patients were removed from therapy
for RECIST-defined disease progression or unacceptable
toxicity. Unacceptable toxicity was defined as a delay of
treatment 4 weeks for recovery to a permissible toxicity
level despite 2 dose level reductions.
Study Outcomes
The primary objective of the current study was to determine the safety profile for sorafenib in combination with
everolimus. The secondary objective was to determine the
pharmacokinetics of the combination.
Safety

All patients who received at least 1 dose of sorafenib
were evaluated for safety. The incidences of adverse
events, DLTs, and abnormal laboratory values were
recorded for each cohort. The severity of adverse events
was assessed using the NCI CTCAE (version 3.0), and the
relation between each adverse event and the study drug
was assessed by the investigator.
Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples for the determination of the plasma
concentration-time profiles of sorafenib were collected after a 6-day run-in of sorafenib on day 1, the day before
everolimus was initiated, at 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, and 24 hours
after sorafenib dosing. On day 15 of cycle 1, the collection
of blood for sorafenib and everolimus levels was repeated
at the same time points. Sorafenib concentrations in K2
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma were
determined using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) method after liquid extraction.
Everolimus blood concentrations in whole blood were
determined using a LC-MSMS method after liquid
extraction. Pharmacokinetic parameters assessed were the
maximum drug concentration (Cmax), the time to Cmax
(Tmax), the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (AUC), and the terminal half-life (t1/2).
Antitumor efficacy

All patients who completed at least 1 cycle of therapy were assessed for response and response duration. Tumor response was assessed using RECIST criteria.10
Imaging was performed at baseline and repeated after

Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).

Center criteria, 67% were classified as intermediate risk,
and 6% were classified as poor risk.11
Disposition
At time of last follow-up (July 2010), 5 patients continued
to receive therapy, with 2 of these patients having been on
study for >1 year. Of the 15 patients who had discontinued therapy at the time of last follow-up, 13 discontinued
because of disease progression and 2 discontinued because
of toxicity.
Safety
Grade 3 or 4 toxicities or grade 2 toxicities that occurred
in at least 2 patients are listed in Table 3. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, rash, and hypophosphatemia. Toxicity was
notable for 7 patients with grade 3 hypophosphatemia in
cohorts 1 and 2, 2 patients with grade 3 diarrhea in cohort
2, and 2 patients with grade 3 rash in cohort 3.

b
After 5 patients were enrolled on this cohort, 1 patient developed a doselimiting toxicity that was comprised of an asymptomatic laboratory abnormality without serious clinical consequences. The University of California at
San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center Data
Safety Monitoring Committee allowed accrual of an additional 3 patients to
the cohort, for a total of 8 patients.

dose level 2 was not associated with serious clinical consequences and was successfully treated with colchicine, allopurinol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, as
well as study dose interruption and temporary dose reduction. Because one of the DLTs among the first 5 patients
in the second cohort constituted a laboratory abnormality
without serious clinical consequences, the University of
California at San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee allowed the second cohort to be expanded by an
additional 3 patients to a total of 8 patients. A total of 9
patients were enrolled on dose level 2, but only 8 were
treated because 1 of the first 6 patients was removed from
the study on the first day of cycle 1 before receiving any
study therapy because of a diagnosis of previously unrecognized Gilbert syndrome; this patient was not replaced.
No additional DLTs were observed in the remainder of
the cohort. Based on these data, dose escalation rules
allowed for further escalation to the originally planned
dose level 3 (everolimus at a dose of 10 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily). However, because
of the chronic toxicities observed past the DLT determination period on this therapy, which was comprised of 2
patients with grade 3 diarrhea, 1 patient with grade 3 photosensitivity, and 1 patient with grade 3 fatigue, dose escalation to the originally planned dose level 3 was not
believed to be prudent.
Patients treated at the MTD required a dose reduction for toxicity at a median of 88.5 days on treatment

4198

(range, 25 days to no dose reduction required). Six of the
8 patients treated at the MTD required a dose reduction,
although 2 were re-escalated to the MTD. Toxicities that
did not meet the definition of a DLT but resulted in
dose reductions included grade 3 asymptomatic hypophosphatemia in 2 patients, grade 3 neutropenia, and
grade 2 diarrhea with grade 2 anal mucositis.
At the time everolimus was approved by the US
FDA, the protocol was amended to allow a modified dose
level, cohort 3, comprised of everolimus at a dose of 10
mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. At
this dose level, there were 2 patients with grade 3 rash and
4 with grade 2 rash. Therefore, this dose level was determined to have exceeded the MTD, making dose level 2,
which was comprised of sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg
twice daily and everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily, the
MTD.
Response Data
In cohort 1, 2 of 6 patients achieved a RECIST-defined
partial response, no patients had stable disease, and 4
patients developed progressive disease. Three of 8 patients
treated in cohort 2 achieved a partial response, and 4 of 8
patients achieved stable disease. One patient was removed
from the study before receiving any study therapy. Of the
6 patients in cohort 3, 1 patient achieved a partial
response, 3 had stable disease, and 2 developed progressive
disease.
Responses by patient are listed in Table 5. Five of 12
patients who had received no prior therapy for metastatic
RCC achieved a partial response. No patients treated with
second-line therapy or beyond achieved a partial response,
but 5 of the 8 patients experienced stable disease. Seven of
8 patients treated in cohort 2, which was determined to be
the MTD, experienced a partial response or stable disease.
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no effect of everolimus on sorafenib levels. Between dose levels, the pharmacokinetics were linear (Table 6). Because of these
observations, pharmacokinetic analysis was not performed
for the final cohort.

DISCUSSION
The results of this phase 1 study indicate that everolimus
and sorafenib can be safely combined at full doses of sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) and half doses of everolimus
(5 mg daily). The combination was found to be well

tolerated with evidence of tumor activity, with 2 of 8
patients at the MTD experiencing objective responses.
Dosing of both agents at full monotherapy doses was
not attempted. Escalation of everolimus from a dose of 5
mg daily to 10 mg daily in combination with sorafenib at
a dose of 400 mg twice daily was not believed to be prudent given that toxicities were cumulative over time. Three
patients of the 8 who were treated in cohort 2 required either dose reductions or study discontinuation for gastrointestinal toxicity, suggesting that this combination therapy
is associated with some chronic toxicity. At a dose of everolimus of 10 mg daily in combination with sorafenib at a
dose of 200 mg twice daily (cohort 3), there was a higher
than expected incidence of rash, with all 6 patients developing a rash, 2 cases of which were classified as grade 3.
Taken together, data from these 2 cohorts suggest that
combining the 2 agents at full doses is not possible.
To our knowledge, the reasons for the inability to
combine everolimus and sorafenib at full doses are
unclear, but pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated
that they do not appear to be pharmacokinetic in nature.
However, pharmacodynamic data suggest that inhibition
of P70 S6 kinase (S6K), a downstream target of mTOR
believed to be a target of clinical significance, is achieved
to a similar degree at both the 5-mg and 10-mg dose levels
of everolimus.12 This suggests that a dose of 5 mg daily is
reasonable for use in combination therapy.

The severity of rash observed in cohort 3 (grade 3 in
2 of 6 patients and grade 2 in the other 4 patients) highlights the importance of phase 1 studies of combination
therapies. Experience from prior combination studies of
targeted therapies has demonstrated that many combinations have unexpected and severe toxicity. For example,
sunitinib in combination with temsirolimus or bevacizumab is not safe at doses considered effective. In contrast,
toxicity from the combination of everolimus and sorafenib
was manageable, and pulmonary toxicity, believed to be
related to everolimus, was observed in 1 patient.

Original Article

Conclusions regarding efficacy in phase 1 studies are
necessarily limited. However, it is remarkable that for the
entire cohort, 25% of patients achieved partial responses,
a number that is greater than would be expected with either drug as monotherapy. Five of 12 patients (42%) who
had not received prior therapy achieved partial responses.
In cohort 2 (everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily), 7 of 8 patients
achieved either a partial response or stable disease.
Although definitive conclusions are not possible given the
sample size, these results suggest that there may be synergy
from this combination.
The results of the current study have established a
reasonable MTD with clinically active doses of both sorafenib and everolimus and a favorable toxicity profile. The
antitumor response suggests that further study of the combination of everolimus and sorafenib is indicated in previously untreated patients with metastatic clear cell RCC.
