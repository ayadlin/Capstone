Abstract
The inhibition of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is an emerging strategy in cancer therapy. Unfortunately, no
specific inhibitors are clinically available. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified multiple peptide
aptamers that bind HSP70. When expressed in human tumor cells, two among these peptide aptamers—A8 and
A17—which bind to the peptide-binding and the ATP-binding domains of HSP70, respectively, specifically
inhibited the chaperone activity, thereby increasing the cells’ sensitivity to apoptosis induced by anticancer
drugs. The 13-amino acid peptide from the variable region of A17 (called P17) retained the ability to specifically
inhibit HSP70 and induced the regression of subcutaneous tumors in vivo after local or systemic injection. This
antitumor effect was associated with an important recruitment of macrophages and T lymphocytes into the
tumor bed. Altogether, these data indicate that peptide aptamers or peptides that target HSP70 may be
considered as novel lead compounds for cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(2); 484–95. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Stress-inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is a prominent cytoprotective factor. Under normal conditions, HSP70
functions as an ATP-dependent chaperone by assisting the
folding of newly synthesized proteins and polypeptides, the
assembly of multiprotein complexes, and the transport of
proteins across cellular membranes (1–3). HSP70 upregulation
by cellular stress or transfection-enforced HSP70 overexpression inhibits apoptosis induced by a wide range of insults and
may facilitate oncogenic transformation (4, 5). Thus, HSP70
overexpression increases the tumorigenicity of cancer cells in
rodent models (6) and correlates with poor prognosis in
cancer (7). Conversely, HSP70 downregulation is sufficient
to kill tumor cells or to sensitize them to apoptosis induction
in vitro (8) and can reduce tumorigenicity in vivo (9). The
antiapoptotic function of HSP70 involves interactions with
several components of the apoptotic machinery. HSP70 has
been demonstrated to bind to Apaf-1, thereby preventing the

recruitment of procaspase-9 to the apoptosome (10). Moreover, HSP70 can inhibit apoptosis by directly neutralizing the
caspase-independent death effector, apoptosis inducing factor
(AIF; 11).
Targeting HSPs is an emerging concept in cancer therapy.
Different inhibitors of HSP90 are being tested in clinical trials.
These are mainly compounds derived from the geldanamycin
antibiotic, such as the 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), but they also include synthetic small molecules designed to bind the ATP domain of HSP90 (12). Like the
synthetic molecules, geldanamycin derivatives also associate
with the HSP90 ATP domain, thus inhibiting ATP binding and,
therefore, affecting the function of signaling proteins whose
structure depends on the HSP90 chaperone activity (13, 14).
Currently, 17AAG is being tested for its chemosensitizing
effects in phase III clinical trials, with encouraging results
in multiple myeloma (15).
HSP70 can be targeted by a "negative" strategy, that is,
siRNAs or antisense oligonucleotides to downregulate its
expression (8, 9). In addition, we have shown the feasibility
of a "positive" HSP70-targeting, chemosensitizing strategy in
which a molecule that antagonizes HSP70 at the protein level
is introduced into cancer cells. Based on our previous results,
which showed that HSP70 specifically binds to AIF and
sequesters it in the cytosol (16), we designed a construct,
encoding the minimal AIF region required for HSP70 binding.
This AIF derivative, called ADD70 (for AIF-Derived Decoy for
HSP70), interacts with the peptide-binding domain of HSP70,
thereby inhibiting the interaction of HSP70 with AIF and other
client proteins. ADD70 was not cytotoxic on its own, yet it
displayed chemosensitizing properties in vitro and in vivo in
rodent models (17). Confirming the interest in neutralizing
HSP70 in cancer therapy, 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES), a

recently introduced small inhibitor of HSP70, has been
described to retard tumor growth in a mouse model of
MYC-driven lymphoma (18, 19).
Taking into account the antiapoptotic and oncogenic functions of HSP70 and the fact that very few molecules specifically
target HSP70, we sought to construct small peptides that
target additional molecular surfaces of HSP70, which may
serve as lead compounds for the development of small HSP70
inhibitors. We report here the mechanistic exploration of the
anticancer effects of HSP70-targeting aptamers and provide a
proof-of-principle that such peptides can inhibit tumor
growth in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cells, plasmids, transfections, and products
HeLa cells [provided by American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), 2007]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; ATCC
2007), HSF1/ MEF (heat shock factor 1/; 20), and
HSP70.1/ HSP70.3/ MEFs (MEF HSP70/; 21) are cultivated in DMEM 10% FBS (Lonza); the mouse B16F10 melanoma cell line (ATCC) is cultivated in RPMI 10% FBS (Lonza);
and the rat colon cancer PROb cells (22) are cultivated in
HAM’S F10 10% FBS (Lonza). Transfections were done by
using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) or the Chariot transduction agent (active motif; Rixensart). G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) was
used at 400 mg/mL. The peptides from the variable region of
the aptamers were synthesized and purified by Proteogenix
and diluted in PBS at the indicated concentration. Recombinant HSPs were from StressGen (TebuBio) and were used at
3.5 ng/mL. PES (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used to a final concentration of 10–20
mmol/L. Cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in PBS and
used to a final concentration of 12.5, 25, or 50 mmol/L.
Etoposide and 5-FU (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted in PBS
and used to a final concentration of 10 mmol/L.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Transfected cell (HSP70, aptamers) were lysed in lysis buffer
[50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
EDTA, and 0.1% NP40], incubated with HA-tag antibody
(16B12 clone), and subjected to immunoblotting. For the
in vitro coimmunoprecipitation, we used HSP70 WT or the
corresponding mutants (both HA-tagged) with purified peptides (biotin-tagged) or peptide aptamers (MYC-tagged). The
peptide aptamers were produced with the TNT Quick Coupled
Transcription/Translation System as follows: 1 mg of template
plasmid DNA was added to the reaction mixture that was later
incubated at 30 C for 90 minutes. Immunoprecipitates were
separated in a 10% or 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a wet transfer
apparatus (Bio-Rad). After blocking nonspecific binding with
5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, membranes were first probed
overnight using primary antibodies: HA-tag antibody was
from Covance (Eurogentec); HSC70 (B-6 clone) was from
Santa-Cruz (TebuBio); and the MYC-tag antibody (9B11
clone) was from Cell signaling (Ozyme; ref. 23). Next, the
membranes were incubated for 1 hour with appropriate

secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and revealed with
ECL (Amersham).
Cell death analysis
The 2.5  105 adherent cells were plated onto 6-well culture
plates in a complete medium. When indicated, cells were
treated with cisplatin (CDDP, 12.5, 25, or 50 mmol/L), etoposide, or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 10 mmol/L) for 24 hours, and/or
the same was applied to peptides P0, P8, and P17 (1–5 mg/L,
24 hours). Cell death was measured by the crystal violet
colorimetric assay or Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) staining.
For PS exposure, 105 cells stained with propidium iodide (PI)
and FITC-Annexin V conjugate were analyzed by flow
cytometry with a FACS Scan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Caspase-3 activity was determined by using the fluorochrome FITC-DEVD-fmk (PromoKine Caspase-3 staining kit;
PromoCell).
HSP70 chaperone activity
HSP70 chaperone activity was evaluated with a protein
thermolability assay. Recombinant HSP70, HSP90, or HSC70
were added (3.5 ng/mL; Stressgen, TebuBio), with or without
the molecules to test (100 ng/mL), to 2 mg/mL of total
proteins from HSF1/ MEFs (Dc Assay kits; Bio-Rad). The
mixture was heated at 55 C for 1 hour. After centrifugation to
eliminate the aggregated proteins, the remaining native proteins in the supernatant were quantified. The ratio between
the initial amount of soluble proteins and that obtained after
heating allowed for the quantification of protein aggregation.
Tumor growth analysis in vivo
Exponentially growing B16F10 cells (wild-type and aptamers-transfected) were harvested and resuspended in an
RPMI medium without FBS to a concentration of 2  106/
mL B16F10 cells. In vivo studies were performed in wild-type
or nu/nu C57/BL6 mice (Charles River). B16F10 cells (5  104
cells) were injected s.c. into the right flank. Tumor volumes
were evaluated every 2 days. The animals were treated according to the guidelines of the Ministere de la Recherche et de la
Technologie, France. All experiments were approved by the
Comite d’Ethique de l’Universite de Bourgogne.
Histologic study of the tumor
Animals were killed 14 or 19 days after cell injection. The
site of the tumor cell injection was resected and snap-frozen in
methylbutane that had been cooled in liquid nitrogen. An
immunohistochemical study of tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells was done on acetone-fixed 5-mm cryostat sections.
Two independent experiments were done in which 4 mice
were injected with the different cells.
Isolation of plasma lipoproteins by gel filtration and
analysis of the peptides by MALDI-TOF
Total lipoproteins were isolated from human plasma in the
d < 1.21 g/mL fraction and were dialyzed overnight against
PBS. For each aptamer, mixtures of lipoproteins (1.9 mg/mL of
protein) and peptide (0.7 mg/mL) were incubated for 1 hour

prior to being fractionated by gel permeation chromatography
on a Superose 6HR column. Peak fractions containing individual lipoproteins (VLDL, very low density lipoproteins; LDL,
low density lipoproteins; HDL: high density lipoproteins) were
delipidated with 100 volumes of ethanol to diethylether (3:2).
The delipidated lipoprotein fraction was then mixed with
9 volumes of a-cyano-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (1 mg/mL)
dissolved in a ratio of acetonitrile to trifluoroacetic acid to
H2O (60:0.1:30, v:v:v). Peptides were spotted on a ground steel
plate and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on an
Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonique S.A.) in the reflectron mode.
Statistical methods
For in vitro experiments, Student's t test and the ANOVA
test (mean  SD) were used for statistical analysis as appropriate. All P values were calculated using 2-sided tests, and
error bars in the graphs represent 95% CIs. For the analysis of
HSP70 activity, we used a repeated-measure ANOVA model
and evaluated with Holm-Sidak.

Results and Discussion
Selection of HSP70-binding peptide aptamers
An optimized yeast 2-hybrid procedure was used to select
peptide aptamers for their ability to bind to HSP70 (24). Two
peptide aptamers libraries, consisting of an Escherichia coli
thioredoxin scaffold displaying variable peptide loops of 8 or
13 amino acids and both of a complexity of 2.5  107 transformants (25), were screened. We selected 8 aptamers with a
variable region of 8 amino acids and 9 aptamers with a variable
region of 13 residues (Table 1). To find the capacity of these
aptamers to bind to endogenous HSP70 in mammalian cancer
cells, we cloned the aptamer coding sequences into an HAtagged pcDNA3 vector and transiently transfected them into
HeLa cells. We then immunoprecipitated the aptamers with an
HA-tag antibody (Fig. 1A, bottom blots) and revealed the
endogenous HSP70 bound by immunoblot (Fig. 1A, top blot).
HSP70 was coimmunoprecipitated to various extents with most
peptide aptamers. Four peptide aptamers (A8, A11, A12, and
A17) exhibited particularly strong binding to HSP70 (Fig. 1A).
HSP70 inactivation in cancer cells sensitizes them to apoptotic killing by anticancer chemotherapeutics (9, 21, 26).
Therefore, we analyzed the chemosensitizing properties of
the 17 selected aptamers. HeLa cells transiently transfected
with aptamer expression vectors were treated with the anticancer agent cisplatin, and cell survival was assessed. None of
the aptamers exhibited any cytotoxicity on their own (Fig. 1B).
However, 2 aptamers (A8 and A17) strongly sensitized the cells
to killing by cisplatin (Fig. 1B). Importantly, A8 and A17
belonged to the group of peptide aptamers that showed the
highest apparent binding affinity for HSP70 (Fig. 1A), inciting
us to continue their characterization.

control aptamer, which did not bind to HSP70 in the yeast
2-hybrid assay (A0), or for the HSP70-targeted aptamers A8 or
A17. Then, the cells were treated with different concentrations
of cisplatin, and cell death was determined by a crystal violet
colorimetric assay. As shown in Figure 2A, none of the
aptamers induced cell death on its own. However, after
cisplatin treatment, the aptamers A8 and A17 increased the
percentage of cell death, for example, by a factor of 3 to 4 for a
concentration of cisplatin of 25 mmol/L during 24 hours. That
this cell death was apoptosis was determined by counting the
cells presenting chromatin condensation (Hoechst 33343), PS
exposure (FITC-Annexin V), and caspase-3 activation (FITCDEVD-fmk; Fig. 2B–D). Figure 2E shows that the sensitizing
effect of the HSP70 peptide aptamers was not just specific for
cisplatin but was a more general effect since A8 and A17 also
strongly increased apoptosis induced by other chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5-FU or etoposide. A similar sensitizing
effect to apoptosis was obtained in mouse melanoma B16F10
cells that were stably transfected with A8 or A17 (Supplementary Fig. 1).

block its chaperone activity (currently in clinical trials) bind to
the ATP-binding domain of HSP90 (27). Immunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated that A17 binds to the HSP70 ATPbinding domain (HSP70DPBD), and the aptamer A8 specifically
binds to the HSP70 peptide-binding domain (HSP70DABD;
Fig. 3A). To find the contribution of inducible HSP70 (as
opposed to constitutive HSP70-like proteins) to A8- and
A17-mediated cell killing, we evaluated chemosensitization
by these aptamers on MEFs originating from wild-type mice
or from mice that were deficient for inducible HSP70 (HSP70.1,
HSP70.3). Both peptide aptamers A8 and A17 showed a strong
chemosensitizing effect on wild-type MEFs responding to
cisplatin (Fig. 3B). In sharp contrast, both aptamers were
completely inactive on HSP70.1/ HSP70.3 / MEFs
(Fig. 3B). Similarly, A8 and A17 lost their chemosensitizing
properties in HeLa cells that were depleted from inducible
HSP70 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; Fig. 3C). These
results indicate that A8 and A17 both specifically exert their
chemosensitizing effects through the blockade of the antiapoptotic activity of inducible HSP70.

The specific effect of A8 and A17 for the HSP70 chaperone
was further studied by a novel method set up in our laboratory
(Fig. 3D). Proteins were extracted from MEFs that lack HSF1,
the main transcription factor responsible for stress-induced
HSP expression (28–30). Therefore, HSF1/ MEF cells
express reduced levels of all inducible HSPs including
HSP70. These HSF1/ MEF proteins were heated (55 C,
1 hour), and protein aggregation was determined in the
presence or absence of recombinant HSPs, alone or in combination with the HSP70 peptides aptamers. By virtue of their
chaperone activity, recombinant HSP70, HSC70, or HSP90
significantly reduced the amount of aggregated proteins
(Fig. 3E and F). The A17 aptamer (and less so, the A8 aptamer)
inhibited HSP70 chaperone activity, but no such inhibitory
activity was observed for the control aptamer A0. Neither A17
nor A8 blocked the chaperone activity of recombinant HSC70
or HSP90 (Fig. 3E), indicating that they are indeed specific for
HSP70.
We next tested, in this in vitro assay, whether the synthetic

Figure 2. Aptamers A8 and A17 sensitize to apoptotic cell death. A, human HeLa cells mock transfected or transfected with the indicated HA-tagged
peptide aptamers were either left untreated or treated with the indicated concentrations of cisplatin for 24 hours. Cell death was determined by a crystal violet
colorimetric assay (X  SD, n ¼ 4). Aptamers expression in the different transfected cells was monitored by Western blotting. B, apoptosis was
measured in the previously described cells that were treated with cisplatin (25 mmol/L for 24 hours) by counting cells with condensed and fragmented nuclear
chromatin after cell staining with Hoechst 33342 dye (X  SD, n ¼ 4). C, to determine phosphatidyl serine exposure, cells described in B were stained
with PI and FITC-Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. D, caspase-3 activity was found by using the fluorochrome FITC-DEVD-FMK in the cells
described in B. E, HeLa cells mock transfected or transfected with the indicated HA-tagged peptide aptamers (A0, A8, A17) were either left untreated or treated
with cisplatin (CDDP, 25 mmol/L), etoposide (ETO, 10 mmol/L), or 5-FU (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Apoptosis was measured by phosphatidyl serine exposure,
as described in C. X  SD, n ¼ 4; *, P < 0.05.

the variable regions of A8 and A17, respectively, also inhibited
the HSP70 chaperone activity. P17 was able to block HSP70
chaperone activity, yet failed to inhibit HSP90 (Fig. 3F). P8
exhibited a rather moderate inhibitory activity on the HSP70
chaperone function (Fig. 3F).
HSP70-binding peptide aptamers induce tumor
regression in vivo
Next, we found whether A8 or A17 inhibited tumor growth
in vivo. B16F10 melanoma cells were stably transfected with
the aptamer expression vectors (A8, A17, and as a control, A0)
and were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic C57/BL6
mice (9 mice/group). Stable expression of the peptide aptamers did not significantly alter the basal level of HSP70 or
HSC70 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Cells expressing the
A0 aptamer, such as wild-type B16F10 cells, formed tumors
that rapidly progressed. In contrast, tumors expressing the
aptamers A8 or A17 gave rise to smaller tumors that did not
progress (Fig. 4A). Mice bearing B16F10-A0, B16F10-A8, or
B16F10-A17 tumors were treated with cisplatin (10 mg/kg i.p.),
given as a single dose on day 6 after the tumor cells injection.

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

Cisplatin treatment slightly reduced the growth of control
tumors (B16F10-A0), yet failed to eradicate these tumors. In
contrast, most B16F10-A17 and, less so, B16F10-A8 tumors
exhibited a complete response to cisplatin, and most mice
remained tumor-free (8 mice of 9 for A17 and 6 of 9 for A8;
Fig. 4A). Very similar results were obtained in the rat PROb
colon cancer model (Supplementary Fig 3).
Interestingly, when B16F10-A8, B16F10-A17, and control
B16F10-A0 melanoma cells were injected into immunodeficient athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, all tumors progressed with
similar kinetics (Fig. 4B). Similarly, PROb-A0, PROb-A8, and
PROb-A18 colon cancer cells proliferated indistinguishably in
athymic nude rats (not shown). To further analyze the
immune response induced by peptide aptamers, we conducted immunohistochemical analyses in sections from
tumors grown in immunocompetent C57/BL6 mice. When
compared with control B16F10-A0 tumors, B16F10-A8 and
B16F10-A17 tumors exhibited a stronger infiltration by CD8þ
T cells and macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that HSP70 inhibition in tumor
cells can trigger an antitumor immune response (9, 21). This is

in accordance with our recent work, showing that HSP70 is
abundantly expressed in the surface of exosomes secreted by
cancer cells and is essential for the activation of the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid cells (31).
P17 sensitizes to apoptotic cell death in vitro
HSP70 peptide aptamers synthesis/purification in sufficient
quantities for their study in vivo in a more therapeutic,
established tumor setting was difficult because of their poor
solubility. Therefore, we decided to test whether we could use
the 8- or 13-amino acid peptides from the variable region of
the aptamers (Table 1). As mentioned above (Fig. 3F), the
synthetic peptides P8 and P17, corresponding to the variable
regions of A8 and A17, were able to inhibit the HSP70
chaperone activity in a cell-free assay. Further, the addition
in the culture medium of P17 peptide (100 ng/mL), but not P8,
was also able to sensitize B16F10 (Fig. 5A) and HeLa cells (not

shown) to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We concluded that
although P8 lost the apoptosis-sensitizing properties of A8,
P17 kept the HSP70 inhibitory and chemosensitizing properties of A17 (Figs. 3F and 5A). This differential effect might
relate to the stability of peptides in the experimental medium.
Although the peptides P0, P8, and P17 could be perfectly
detected just after their addition in the culture medium (they
gave the expected monoisotopic m/z values), only the P17
peptide was still detected by mass spectrometry analysis as
late as 1 hour after its addition (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The
increased stability of P17 might relate to its ability to associate
with plasma lipoproteins (32, 33). Plasma lipoproteins were
incubated for 1 hour at 37 C with P0, P8, or P17 and 4 fractions
containing VLDL (elution volume: 6–8 mL), LDL (elution
volume: 8–12.5 mL), HDL (elution volume: 12.5–17 mL), or
unbound proteins that were separated by gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Although P0 and P8

P17 associated with plasma VLDL, LDL, and HDL (Supplementary Fig. 5C).
The chemical inhibitor of HSP70, PES, has been shown to
induce autophagic cell death (19). We have, therefore, compared the cell death type induced by PES and P17 when
combined with cisplatin treatment. We have found that
although a clear vacuolization characteristic of autophagic
cell death with the absence of caspase-3 activation could be
observed in B16F10 cells sensitized to cisplatin by PES, no
morphologic signs of autophagic cell death could be observed
in the cells sensitized by P17 (Fig. 5B, right and left panels). In
contrast, P17 induced the appearance of obvious signs of
apoptosis (apoptotic bodies, chromatin condensation, and
caspase-3 activity; Fig. 5B). We next studied whether P17 kept
the ability of A17 to bind to the HSP70 ATP-binding domain.
To do that, we linked the tridecapeptide to a biotin and carried

out coimmunoprecipitation experiments in vitro with purified
P17 and HA-tagged HSP70 or HSP70DPBD proteins. We found
that P17-biotin was able to associate with both HSP70 and
HSP70DPBD and, interestingly, when ATP (100 mmol/L) was
added in the immunoprecipitation buffer, P17 maintained its
binding ability (Fig. 5C). This may suggest that either ATP does
not physically interfere with the P17 association with the
HSP70 ATP-binding domain or, alternatively, that P17 binds
with higher affinity than ATP.
Antitumor and immunogenic effect of P17 in tumorbearing mice
We next tested the peptides P8 and P17 in intratumor
injections in animals already bearing a tumor of approximately 90 mm3. Mice carrying B16F10 subcutaneous melanoma were injected intratumor with the P8 and P17 peptides
(50 mg/kg, diluted in PBS). Peptide injections were repeated

Fig. 6A) or 5-FU (50 mg/kg; Fig. 6B) was added i.p. as a single
dose on the day after the first intratumor injection of the
peptides. As shown in Figure 6A and B, local administration of
P17, but not P8, induced a very significant regression of the
tumors that was almost complete when the animals were also
treated with cisplatin or 5-FU.
In a more therapeutic setting, we next administered the
peptides systemically. Mice carrying B16F10 subcutaneous
melanoma (tumor size of approximately 20–40 mm3) were
injected i.p. (Fig. 7A) or i.v. (Supplementary Fig. 6) with P8 or

P17 peptides (3 mg/kg). Peptide injections were repeated
every other day. Half the animals were also treated with
cisplatin (10 mg/kg), given i.p. as a single dose. P17 (but
not P8) was efficient in reducing the size of the tumors,
particularly when the tumors were growing in immunocompetent animals (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig 6) and less so
when they were growing in athymic nu/nu mice (Fig. 7B),
underscoring the importance of the immune system for the
therapeutic efficacy of P17.

although i.p. injection of P17 induced the tumor cells
apoptosis, it has no significant toxicity in the mice intestinal
progenitor cells, one of the most sensitive cells to different
stresses (34; Supplementary Fig. 7).
In conclusion, P17 is an efficient antitumor agent. The fact
that P17 but not P8 is active in vitro and in vivo may be related
to its ability to bind plasma lipoproteins (Supplementary Fig 5
A–C). This association may protect the peptide from proteolysis. Indeed, and as compared with free peptides, plasma
lipoproteins are known to reside much longer in the intravascular compartment with mean residence times reaching
several days (35), and as a consequence, extending the half-life
of lipoprotein-bound compounds in vivo. In addition, lipoprotein receptors might facilitate the cellular uptake of lipoprotein-bound peptides.

exhibited a stronger infiltration by T cells, macrophages, and
dendritic and NK cells than tumors treated with P0 or P8
(Fig. 7C and Table 2). Since, in vitro, P17 sensitized to
apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5A and B), we studied its ability,
after its i.p. administration, to induce apoptosis in the tumor
sections. P17 treatment significantly induced apoptosis in the
tumors, whereas P8 hardly had any effect (Fig. 7D). Therefore,
the amount of apoptosis in the tumors correlated well with the
increase in immune cells infiltrating the tumor (Fig. 7C) and
the magnitude of the tumor regression (Fig. 7A). Interestingly,

Concluding remarks
HSP-targeting drugs have recently emerged as potential
anticancer agents, driven by the consideration that HSP may
have oncogene-like functions and likewise may mediate a
"nononcogene addiction" of stressed tumor cells that must
adapt to a hostile microenvironment (36). Cancer cells must
extensively rewire their metabolic and signal transduction
pathways, thereby becoming dependent on proteins that are
dispensable for the survival of normal cells. Unfortunately, the
sole drugs that are thus far clinically available are inhibitors of
HSP90, with most of them being geldanamycin derivatives
such as 17AAG. We, and others, have validated HSP70 as a
promising target for cancer therapy, using antisense molecules, a HSP70-binding construction derived from AIF
(ADD70), and in this work, peptide aptamers that are specific
for inducible HSP70. The cytotoxic effect of HSP70 sequestration is particularly strong in transformed cells yet is undetectable in normal, nontransformed cell lines or primary cells
(8, 9). The specificity is explained by the constitutive expression of inducible HSP70 in most cancers, which is needed for
the survival of tumor cells (37). This is confirmed in the
present work since we have shown that inactivation of
HSP70 by our peptide P17 induces apoptosis in tumor cells
but does not affect the progenitors’ intestinal cells’ survival
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
Unlike the recently reported PES (19), the aptamer that we
isolated as the one to be most efficient in the inhibition of
HSP70 chaperone activity, A17, binds to the HSP70 ATPbinding domain. HSP70 peptide aptamers did not have any
toxicity on cultured cells in vitro yet strongly increased cellular
sensitivity to toxic stimuli such as cisplatin. However, in vivo,
the expression of the HSP70 peptide aptamers, or the injection
of the derived peptide P17, was sufficient to induce tumor cell
death. One possible explanation for this discrepancy might be
that tumor cells growing in vivo are exposed to a more
stressful microenvironment (i.e., lack of nutrients and/or
oxygen) than cells cultured in vitro, explaining their increased
dependence on (or "addiction" to) inducible HSP70.
The anticancer response induced by HSP70-targeting peptides, relied heavily on the contribution of the cellular immune
system, as shown by the massive infiltration of macrophages,
T lymphocytes, and dendritic and NK cells into the tumors

treated by HSP70 peptide aptamers. This is an interesting
observation that relaunches the debate on the immunogenic
role of inducible HSP70 (38). Cytosolic HSP70 purified from
distinct tumors can elicit tumor-specific immunity by functioning as a vehicle for antigenic peptides (39). The immunogenic and antiapoptotic functions of HSP70 may have
opposite effects since tumor cell death plays a central role
in inducing a specific immune response (40). However, we
have recently shown that HSP70 expressed in the surface of
exosomes produced by cancer cells is responsible for the
activation of the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid
cells (31). Therefore, inactivation of this external HSP70 can

allow the induction of an immune antitumor response, such as
the one we find in this work.
The pharmacologically most relevant finding of this work is
the discovery that the 13-amino acid peptide (P17) from the
variable region of A17 reproduces the HSP70-blocking chaperone activity and antitumor properties of A17 in vitro and in
vivo. Because of their low molecular weight and high water
solubility, small peptides are likely to be cleared within a few
minutes from the bloodstream through renal filtration. Binding to lipoproteins can be a way of extending their half-life and
to increase the cellular uptake (35). We have found that P17,
but not P8, binds to plasma lipoproteins, correlating with its

NOTE: Quantitative evaluation of antigen expression in tumor sections 12 days after the first i.p. injection of P0, P8, or P17 into
syngeneic mice. T cells, macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells were labeled using CD3, F4/80, CD11b, CD11c, and NKp46
antibodies, respectively. Labeled cells were counted from 300 cells chosen randomly in different microscopic fields (6 mice per
group).

stability and antitumor efficacy. Therefore, P17, which can be
easily synthesized and administered systemically, is a promising compound that may deserve further preclinical as well as
clinical evaluation in phase I trials.
