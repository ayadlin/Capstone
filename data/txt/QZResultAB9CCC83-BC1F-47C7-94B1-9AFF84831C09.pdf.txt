ABSTRACT
Src activation is involved in cancer progression and the interplay with EGFR.
Inhibition of Src activity also represses the signalling pathways regulated by
EGFR. Therefore, Src has been considered a target molecule for drug development.
This study aimed to identify the compounds that target Src to suppress lung
cancer tumourigenesis and metastasis and investigate their underlying molecular
mechanisms. Using a molecular docking approach and the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) compound dataset, eight candidate compounds were selected, and we evaluated
their efficacy. Among them, rhodomycin A was the most efficient at reducing the
activity and expression of Src in a dose-dependent manner, which was also the
case for Src-associated proteins, including EGFR, STAT3, and FAK. Furthermore,
rhodomycin A significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
and clonogenicity in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. In addition, rhodomycin A
rendered gefitinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells more sensitive to gefitinib
treatment, implying a synergistic effect of the combination therapy. Our data also
reveal that the inhibitory effect of rhodomycin A on lung cancer progression may act
through suppressing the Src-related multiple signalling pathways, including PI3K,
JNK, Paxillin, and p130cas. These findings will assist the development of anti-tumour
drugs to treat lung cancer.

RESULTS

cancers. Recently, targeted therapy has shed some light
on lung cancer treatment because of the close association
between the occurrence and activation of oncogenes or
the inhibition of tumour suppressors [2]. For example,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or
EGFR overexpression can be detected in non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, leading to the aberrant
growth, metastasis, and resistance development of cancer
cells [3]. Most of these mutations constitutively activate
the kinase responsible for cellular signal transduction,
demolishing cellular control over regulation. Therefore,
small molecules against particular mutated kinase may be
useful for improving lung cancer treatment [4].
Amongst the currently accessible drugs against lung
cancer, geﬁtinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva), so called
EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), are
effective in patients with EGFR mutations, including exon
19 deletion and exon 21 substitution (L858R) [5]. EGFRTKIs thwart the capacity of self-phosphorylation in EGFR,
and in tandem, affect the downstream signalling cascade
[6]. However, drug resistance appears to be inevitable.
Studies have shown that EGFR with a T790M mutation, a
secondary mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, is highly
correlated with lung cancer relapse [7]. Although a drug
mixture regimen improves the effectiveness of lung cancer
treatment, more efforts are still needed to discover novel
drugs or compounds that improve targeted therapy [8].
Src, a tyrosin kinase, is associated with the cellular
growth, migration, and angiogenesis of tumour cells,
making Src a potential target for lung cancer treatment
[9]. Clinically, Src activation is commonly detected in
NSCLC [10]. Additionally, once the expression level of
Src is increased, a poor prognosis is observed in patients
with NSCLC [11], colorectal [12] and breast cancers [13].
Due to the interactions between Src and EGFR, NSCLC
treatment can be improved by suppressing Src [14].
This approach is strongly supported by a study in which
apoptosis could be induced by adding a Src suppressor
to disrupt the EGFR pathway [15]. Consequently, many
candidates, such as dasatinib, saracatinib, bosutinib, KX2391, XL999, XL288, and M475271, have been developed
and subjected to clinical trials [16].
Src has been shown to be a potential target against
lung cancer in light of its impacts on tumour growth
by disrupting essential pathways. In this study, we first
identified rhodomycin A by a molecular docking strategy
and then investigated the functional roles of this drug in
suppressing lung cancer progression and elucidated its
molecular mechanisms. These results not only suggest
potential new drugs but also unravel mechanisms to
improve cancer treatment.

The chemical structures of NCI compound sets
containing 46,827 antitumour drugs (http://www.dtp.
nci.nih.gov/docs/cancer/cancer_data.html) were docked
into the Src ATP binding site by the LibDock protocol of
Discovery Studio v3.5. The derived LibDock score and
consensus score were calculated based on the docking
poses. Two ligands, dasatinib and imatinib, were adopted
as the control ligands, in which candidate compounds
must have a higher LibDock score and consensus score
than the control ligands (Supplementary Table S1).
Finally, we chose the top 8 compounds predicted to
have the best performance in the virtual screening as
candidate compounds, labelled N1 to N8. These candidate
compounds were then utilised in the following biological
assays for further screening.
The Western blot analyses showed that both N3
and N8 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of
Src. Furthermore, N3 exhibited better performance in
inhibiting EGFR and phosphor-EGFR than N8 in the
two cell lines initially tested (Figure 1A). Therefore, we
chose compound N3, i.e., rhodomycin A, to investigate
its molecular mechanisms in Src activation and its effects
on the related pathways essential for the growth and
migration of tumour cells.

Cytotoxic effect of rhodomycin A on cancer and
noncancerous cells
To determine the proper concentration prior to the
following experiments, we analysed the viability of PC9
(EGFRexon19 del; gefitinib-sensitive), PC9/gef (EGFRexon19
del
; gefitinib-resistant), A549 (EGFRwild-type; gefitinibresistant), and H1975 (EGFRL858R+T790M; gefitinib-resistant)
lung adenocarcinoma cells for 24, 48, and 72 hours after
exposure to rhodomycin A. Our results indicated that the
cancer cell survival rate decreases in a dose-dependent
manner. Notably, at 72 hours, 0.01 μΜ rhodomycin A
resulted in a death rate of 20-30% for PC9, PC9/gef, and
H1975 cells; 0.05 μΜ a death rate of > 40%; and > 0.1 μΜ
a death rate of > 80%. The IC50 at each time point is shown
in Figure 1B, and it is approximately tens to hundreds on
a nM scale. For the non-tumoural BEAS2B cells, the IC50
was 1.02 μΜ at 24 hours, 0.1 μΜ at 48 hours, and 0.073
μΜ at 72 hours. Taken together, these experiments showed
that rhodomycin A is less toxic for non-cancerous cells
(Supplementary Figure S1).

showed that with increased compound concentrations and

those of Src, pSTAT3, and STAT3 slightly decreased in

In the PC9/gef cell line, the gefitinib-resistant
counterpart of PC9 cells, we discovered that the inhibitory
pattern is somewhat different from the PC9 cells. The
expression levels of p-Src, Src, p-EGFR, and EGFR were
significantly reduced with the increase in the compound
concentration and treatment time; nevertheless, those
of p-STAT3, STAT3, p-FAK, and FAK were inhibited
slightly (Figure 2B). Additionally, rhodomycin A slightly
decreased the phosphorylation of Src, EGFR, STAT3,
and FAK in dose-dependent manner in A549 cells and
somewhat decreased the total level of expressed proteins,
which was dependent on the time period of treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2).

migration analyses were performed. Rhodomycin A
suppressed the proliferation of PC9, PC9/gef, A549,
and H1975 cancer cells (Figure 3A). Moreover, it also
inhibited the abilities of anchorage-dependent and
-independent cell colony growth, regardless of whether the
cells were gefitinib-sensitive (PC9) or -resistant (PC9/gef),
even at a low concentration (Figure 3B). Similar results
were observed in the A549 and CL1-5 lung cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure S3, S4).
A previous study demonstrated that the activation
and expression of Src could promotes cancer cell
migration and invasion [17]. To determine the impacts
of rhodomycin A on the migration and invasion of cancer
cells, we treated PC9 and PC9/gef cells with various
concentrations of rhodomycin A, which showed significant
repression of cancer cell motility and invasiveness relative
to control (Figure 3C and 3D).

Src in the treated mice was drastically lower compared
with the untreated mice (Figure 4C). Taken together,
our data indicated that rhodomycin A influences not
only the physical properties of the tumours but also the
biochemistry. To investigate the effect of rhodomycin
A combined with gefitinib, the gefitinib-resistant lung

pathways

low-dose gefitinib (0.01 or 0.05 μM) had a synergistic
effect. Moreover, the concentration of 0.05 or 0.1 μM
rhodomycin A used in the combination treatment rendered
the H1975 cells more sensitive to gefitinib, even down to 1
μM. Overall, the results revealed that 0.05 μM and 0.1 μM
rhodomycin A can synergistically sensitise A549, PC9/gef,
and H1975 lung cancer cells to a wide range of gefitinib
treatment concentrations (Figure 4D).

Because Src influences many downstream proteins,
such as STAT3, PI3K, JNK, Paxillin, p130cas, MEK, and
ERK [18], we further investigated whether rhodomycin
A impacts any of these proteins. After exposing gefitinibsensitive PC9 cells to rhodomycin A, we detected both

diminished phosphorylation of PI3K, JNK, Paxillin, and
p130cas and decreased protein expression in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5A). A similar pattern was also
observed in gefitinib-resistant PC9/gef cells. However, in
the EGFR wild-type and gefitinib-resistant A549 cells,
only PI3K and p-PI3K were significantly decreased by
rhodomycin A treatment. Moreover, no significant changes
were detected in the phosphorylation or quantity of MEK
and ERK compared with the other Src downstream
proteins in these three cell lines (Figure 5B).

and accelerate drug screening [22]. In this study, we
identified rhodomycin A as a promising candidate
compound for inhibiting Src activity and NSCLC from
the NCI compound library using a molecular docking
strategy. Further investigations showed that rhodomycin
A significantly inhibits in vitro cellular functions and in
vivo tumourigenicity of NSCLC cells, as well as exerts
a synergistic effect on tumour growth. Little is known
about rhodomycin A because there are few publications
on this compound. This chemical is a member of the
anthracycline family, which has antitumour activities
[23]. Anthracyclines originated from chemotherapy agents
extracted from Streptomyces peucetius [24]. Among
them, doxorubicin is the most well-known, and it has
exhibited better performance in cancer treatment [25].
However, the antitumour action of rhodomycin A remains
unclear. Our data revealed its multi-functional role and
possible involvement in signalling pathways. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that
rhodomycin A suppresses NSCLC malignancy through
modulating multiple Src-related signalling pathways.
EGFR overexpression is detected in 40-80%
of NSCLC. EGFR is essential for regulating cell
proliferation, shedding light on lung cancer treatment
[26]. In NSCLC, mutations on the EGFR kinase domain
constitutively activate EGFR and its downstream
signalling pathways, making cells lose control over
proliferation [27]. Because there are interactions between
Src and EGFR, the suppression of Src may interrupt
the downstream signalling pathways of EGFR, such as
inducing apoptosis in EGFR mutation cell lines [28].
Additionally, suppressing Src increases the expression
level of E-cadherin, improving the effectiveness of EGFRTKIs [29].
Many Src inhibitors have been created for cancer
treatment [16]. Among them, dasatinib has been used to
treat patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia [30] and can
improve the antitumour capacity of cisplatin in NSCLC
cell lines [10]. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of dasatinib
is poor in both lung cancer A549 cells with wild-type
EGFR or in H1975 cells harbouring L858R and T790M
mutations [28], which is similar to the medical outcome
of gefitinib treatment. Interestingly, rhodomycin A has
activity in all lung cancer cell lines (A549, PC9/gef, and
H1975) without particular selectivity for the EGFR status
in cytotoxicity. Moreover, it had a higher IC50 in the nontumourigenic human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B)
than the tumour cell lines used in this study.
In the murine xenograft model, several mice died
after the 4th drug dose, although rhodomycin A could
reduce tumourigenicity, Src activity, and Src expression.
We speculated that this effect may be due to its metabolites
or accumulated toxicity. A previous report indicated
that not only the dosage but also the duration of taking
anthracyclines increases the chances of heart failure [31].
Therefore, the deaths of those mice were likely associated

Functional roles of rhodomycin A in protein
degradation and transcriptional reduction
The above results revealed that the expression
levels of Src and its related proteins were reduced,
which suggested that rhodomycin A may trigger protein
degradation. After treatment with CHX, the Western
blotting results showed that the protein levels of Src,
EGFR, STAT3, and FAK are decreased (Figure 6A, left
panel). Similar trends were also observed after adding
rhodomycin A (Figure 6A, middle panel). Importantly,
the simultaneous treatment of CHX and rhodomycin
A significantly augmented the degradation of the tested
proteins (Figure 6A, right panel). These data implied that
rhodomycin A could promote protein degradation.
To examine whether rhodomycin A facilitated
protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome
system, we used MG132, an inhibitor targeting the 26S
proteasome, to interrupt this pathway. Our data showed
that the expression levels of Src, EGFR, and STAT3 but
not FAK were at least partially restored in the cells treated
with rhodomycin A and MG132, in contrast to those
treated with rhodomycin A alone (Figure 6B). To explore
the effect of rhodomycin A on the transcription level of the
tested genes, their expression levels were evaluated with
real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that rhodomycin
A could significantly reduce the mRNA expression of
Src, EGFR, STAT3, and FAK, even at a relatively low
concentration (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
The aberrant activation of Src, a typical non-receptor
tyrosine kinase (nRTK), has been reported in many
cancers, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic
cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer [19]. A
previous study showed that this event contributes to higher
drug resistance in patients with lung adenocarcinoma cells
[20]. Src overexpression is observed in 50-80% of NSCLC
patients and is related to poor prognosis. Therefore, Src
can be used as a target to treat lung cancer [21].
Computer-aided drug design, such as pharmacophore
modelling and molecular docking, is a powerful tool
to evaluate the interactions between drugs and targets

with heart failure. Because this concern is beyond the
scope of our research, we did not investigate this issue
further.
The dual inhibition of Src and EGFR activity is a
reasonable concept that may benefit NSCLC patients
with acquired EGFR resistance mutation. A previous
paper demonstrated that doxorubicin, an anthracycline
glycoside derivative, can synergise with gefitinib and
result in enhanced antitumour activity against the adrenal
neuroblastoma of transgenic mice [32]. Unfortunately, a
phase II clinical trial of dasatinib combining erlotinib or
gefitinib for lung adenocarcinoma patients with acquired
resistance mutation did not have positive results [33]. Our
findings perhaps provide a potential candidate compound
for the replacement of dasatinib in the combination
therapy of a Src inhibitor and EGFR-TKI. Our in vitro data
indicated that rhodomycin A could substantially sensitise
gefitinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549, PC9/
gef, and H1975) to gefitinib treatment, implying a potential
benefit for the clinical application of this compound in
reducing the dose of gefitinib. The synergistic effect of
TKI treatment combined with rhodomycin A may decrease
the cost of targeted therapy drug and patient load.
Participating in many signalling pathways, Src
plays an important role in promoting tumour growth,
and elevating the tumours’ capacity for proliferation,
angiogenesis, invasion, migration, and metastasis [17].
Our study demonstrated that rhodomycin A inhibits
cellular functions and prevents tumour growth. On
signal transduction, Src influences the activities of
PI3K, STAT3, FAK, JNK, Paxillin, p130cas, MEK,
and ERK, which are widely considered to be essential
for cell growth, angiogenesis, and migration [18]. In
cancer cell survival, the previous studies showed that
RTK and Src mediate cell survival and regulate cell
cycle progression through activating the PI3K/AKT
pathway [34]. Moreover, the PI3K signalling cascade
is involved in a broad range of cancer-related cellular
processes [35]. In our study, rhodomycin A not only
inhibited Src and EGFR activity but also suppressed
PI3K phosphorylation and expression in EGFR mutant
(PC9 and PC9/gef) and wild-type (A549) cell lines. In
cancer cell migration, several reports have indicated
that the FAK-Src complex promotes activities of many
FAK-associated Src substrates, including p190RhoGAP,
paxillin, and p130cas, which play an important role in
the reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton and motility
[36]. Furthermore, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation
would lead to the transcriptional activation of MMP2 and MMP-9, favouring proteolysis and invasion [37].
Our data revealed that rhodomycin A inhibits FAK, JNK,
Paxillin, and p130cas activity and the protein expression
in PC9 and PC9/gef cell lines, which may cause the
decrease of cancer cell invasion and migration ability. In
cancer cell growth, MEK and ERK may be involved in
the pathway activated by RTKs and integrins and further
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stimulate mitogenesis [38]; however, no changes were
detected in either MEK and ERK protein expression or
phosphorylation in the tested cell lines, except for in A549
cells at a higher treatment dose. Additionally, rhodomycin
A downregulated RNA expression and promoted protein
degradation, which may have occurred via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway, which is a common feature for
antitumour drugs [39]. Further investigations are needed
to determine the detailed mechanisms.
Although we suggest that rhodomycin A can affect
Src and subsequently, downstream-related proteins
through Src inhibition, we cannot rule out the possibility
that rhodomycin A influences multiple targets. Previous
reports have indicated that multi-target drugs compensate
for the disadvantages of single target counterparts in
disease treatment. For example, imatinib and sunitinib,
which are used on gastrointestinal stromal tumours
(GISTs), simultaneously interrupt BCR-ABL, KIT, and
PDGFR tyrosine kinase pathways, promoting cell cycle
arrest [40, 41]; sorafenib inhibits the VEGFR, PDGFR,
KIT, FLT3, and RAF pathways in late-stage kidney cancer
[42]. In this study, rhodomycin A inhibited cancer cell
proliferation, clonogenicity, motility, and invasiveness,
showing that it may possess a multi-functional effect,
which could contribute to its benefits as a cancer treatment.
Therefore, as a single- or multi-target drug, rhodomycin A
may be useful in the development of future therapeutic
drugs, such as a lead compound.

template were gently mixed and then subjected to PCR
reaction. TATA-box binding protein (TBP) was used as
the internal control (GenBank X54993). The detailed
procedures and calculations have been previously
described [43].

To determine the clonogenicity of cancer cells,
anchorage-dependent and -independent approaches were
used as described previously [45]. For the anchorageindependent growth assay, 2 ml of 0.7% LMP agarose
was poured onto a plate to create a basal layer. As the
basal layer solidified, 100 μl of 1×104/ml cells were
seeded with 900 μl of culture media and 1 ml of 0.7%
LMP agarose. After a gentle mixing, drugs of the desired
concentration were added. Once the colonies formed, 0.5
mg/ml of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet was added to stain
the colonies. For the anchorage-dependent growth assay,
500 cells were seeded in a culture dish that had culture
media and drug solution. When the colonies formed after
7-10 days, the cells were washed using 1xPBS and fixed
for 15 minutes using methanol. The 0.005% crystal violet
was added to stain the colonies for > 8 hours. After the
colonies were photographed, the number of colonies with
a diameter larger than 0.1 mm was calculated.

Western blotting
Western blot analysis was used to determine the
protein phosphorylation and expression after rhodomycin
A treatment. The detailed procedures were as previously
described [44]. Briefly, the membrane was incubated
with primary antibody at a different dilution in antibody
diluent buffer overnight at 4ºC. Anti-GAPDH (Upstate
Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA) was used as a
loading control. EGFR, STAT3 (F-2), PI3K, phosphoMEK1/2 (Ser218/Ser222), MEK, phospho-ERK (Tyr204),
ERK, Paxillin, and p130cas were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA); phosphoSrc (pY418), phospho-FAK (Tyr576), and FAK were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA);
phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068), phospho- STAT3 (Tyr705),
phospho-PI3K (Tyr458), phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/
Tyr185), SAPK/JNK, phospho-Paxillin (Tyr118), and
phospho-p130cas (Tyr410) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA); and the
primary antibody for Src was made in house (ATCC CRL2651). The membrane was washed 3 times with wash
buffer and incubated in HRP-conjugated IgG antibody
(diluted 1:5000) at room temperature. The reaction was
stopped by washing the membrane three times with PBST
and then photographed with the UVP AutoChemi Image
System (UVP, Upland, CA, USA). Where appropriate, the
Western blot data were quantified by image system and
normalized with the loading control. The relative fold
changes were shown below the blots.

Migration and invasion assay
A transwell membrane (8 μm pore size, 6.5 mm
diameter; Corning Costar Corporation, MA) coated with
or without Matrigel (2.5 mg/ml; BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) was used for invasion and transwell migration
assays as described previously [46]. The upper wells were
filled with serum-free medium and cells (2×104 or 5×103
cells per well). The lower wells of the transwells contained
the same medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

Tumourigenesis and immunohistochemistry assay
Sixteen
four-week-old
severe
combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) nude mice were purchased
from the National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC,
Taipei, Taiwan). We achieved tumour growth in the mice
according to previously described protocols [47]. In total,
4×106 live PC9/gef cells were injected subcutaneously into
the nude mice. Tumor volume was assessed weekly until
volumes reached an average of 100 mm3. To examine the
effects of drugs on tumour suppression, the mice were
grouped into DMSO-treated (with 0.1% DMSO) and
drug-treated (with 0.25 mg/kg of rhodomycin A) groups.
Every two days, the former was injected with 100 μl of
PBS with 0.1% DMSO, whereas the latter was injected
with drugs. After 6-7 weeks, the mice were sacrificed
using CO2, and their tumour volumes were estimated from
their caliper-measured lengths (a) and widths (b) using
the formula V = 0.4 × ab2 [48]. The mouse experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the National Chung Hsing University.
Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on the

Cell viability assay and proliferation assays
The PrestoBlue® (Invitrogen) cell viability reagent
was used to determine the cytotoxic impact of the
compound or cell proliferation ability according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded onto a 96well plate (2.5×103/100 μl) and cultured at 37ºC for 12-16
hours. After removing the cultured media, 100 μl of drugs
with the desired concentration was added to each well.
After 24, 48, and 72 hours, 10 μl of PrestoBlue reagent
was added, and the cells were allowed to rest for 1 hour at
37ºC before absorbance at 570/600 nm measured using an
ELISA Reader (Vector3; Perkin-Elmer, Santa Clara, CA,
USA).

rhodomycin A and/or 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), an inhibitor to stop
protein synthesis. After 4, 8, and 12 hours, the cell lysates
were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis of
the tested proteins. Furthermore, to investigate whether
the protein degradation occurs through ubiquitination, the
cells were harvested after incubation with 50 nM MG132

Drug synergy analysis
To determine the combined effect of various
concentrations of rhodomycin A and gefitinib on
A549, PC9/gef and H1975 cytotoxicity, the data from
the proliferation assays were entered into CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK), and the combination
index (CI)-isobologram method was used as described
previously [49]. CI < 1, CI = 1 or CI > 1 represent
the synergism, additive effect or antagonism of both
compounds, respectively.
