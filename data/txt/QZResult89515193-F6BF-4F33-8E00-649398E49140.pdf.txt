ABSTRACT:
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–85% of lung cancer cases,
and almost half of newly diagnosed patients have metastatic disease. Pemetrexed
is a widely used drug for NSCLC and inhibits several folate-dependent enzymes
including thymidylate synthase (TS). Increased expression of TS confers resistance
to pemetrexed in vitro and predicts poor response to pemetrexed. Rapamycin is an
mTOR inhibitor and suppresses cap-dependent synthesis of specific mRNA species.
Here, we show that the combination of rapamycin and pemetrexed synergistically
inhibits proliferation of NSCLC cells. Although pemetrexed as a single agent induced
TS, pretreatment with rapamycin suppressed pemetrexed-induced TS expression.
In vivo, the combination of rapamycin and pemetrexed inhibited growth of NSCLC
xenografts, which correlated with decreased mTOR activity and suppression of
pemetrexed-induced TS expression. The ability of rapamycin to enhance the efficacy
of pemetrexed and prevent TS expression has implications for the design of Phase
I and/or Phase II NSCLC clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors in combination with
pemetrexed.

INTRODUCTION

chemically similar to folic acid and inhibits three
enzymes that contribute to purine and pyrimidine
synthesis; thymidylate synthase (TS), hidydrofolate
reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide
formyltransferase (GARFT) [4]. Pemetrexed was approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a firstline therapy for advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients
when combined with cisplatin and as a maintenance
therapy for patients with advanced non-squamous
NSCLC who do not experience disease progression after
platinum-based chemotherapy [5, 6]. Pemetrexed as a
single-agent is a standard treatment for recurrent NSCLC
patients who have previously received platinum-based
chemotherapy, but the overall response rate is less than
10% and resistance to pemetrexed eventually develops
[4]. The modest responses in the front line, second line,
and maintenance settings provide rationale to develop new

Approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases and 0.6
million cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United
States in 2013, and lung cancer is responsible for 26% and
28% of all female and male cancer deaths, respectively
[1]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for
80–85% of lung cancers, and 54% of patients with newly
diagnosed NSCLC have advanced disease (i.e., distant
stage or metastasis) [2]. Platinum-based chemotherapy
regimens given as first-line treatment to advanced NSCLC
patients with a good performance status have plateaued in
overall response rate (25%-35%), median survival (8-10
mo.), one-year survival (30%-40%), and two-year survival
(10%-15%) [3]. The best chemotherapy regimen for
patients with advanced NSCLC remains to be determined.

approaches to enhance the efficacy of pemetrexed.
Several mechanisms of resistance to antifolates have
been described that include impaired influx, alteration of
intracellular metabolism, increased target enzymes, an
expanded folate pool, and increased efflux [7]. Increased
expression of TS confers resistance to pemetrexed in lung
cancer cells in vitro [8, 9] and is a predictive factor for
poor response to pemetrexed in patients [10], indicating
that inhibition of TS expression may be beneficial for
overcoming resistance to pemetrexed.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family,
and controls protein synthesis, energy metabolism, cell
proliferation, and survival [11]. Recently, it has been
reported that pemetrexed can activate AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) through inhibition of a folatedependent enzyme called aminoimidazolecarboxamide
ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICART), which
indirectly inhibits mTOR and decreases phosphorylation
of downstream substrates[12, 13], suggesting that mTOR
inhibition can be a consequence of anti-folate activities.
Previously we reported that rapamycin, an
mTOR inhibitor, prevented the development of tobacco
carcinogen–induced lung tumors in a mouse model,
suggesting that the mTOR pathway is implicated in
lung tumorigenesis [14]. Because rapamycin has broad
anti-proliferative activity across a series of NSCLC cell
lines, we hypothesized that combining rapamycin with
pemetrexed might enhance mTOR inhibition, suppress TS
expression, and synergistically decrease proliferation of
NSCLC cells. Our data confirm that rapamycin enhances
the efficacy of pemetrexed and suppresses pemetrexedinduced TS expression in vitro and in vivo.

Kras. The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values of
each drug when used in combination were less than when
used as single treatments, indicating synergistic effects
at the effective dose 50 (ED50) (Table 1). Computersimulated Fa-CI curves showed synergism (CIs <1) in
the four cell lines evaluated (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table 1). These data suggest that rapamycin enhances the
anti-proliferative effects of pemetrexed.
Because rapamycin is a prototypic mTOR
inhibitor and pemetrexed has been reported to decrease
mTOR activity in a small number of cell lines, mTOR
inhibition was assessed in a series of NSCLC cell lines.
Phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1
was measured as a surrogate for mTOR activity. S6 is
phosphorylated by S6K, which is a direct substrate of
mTOR. 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is regulated by
mTOR and inhibits 5′-cap-dependent mRNA translation
by binding and inactivating eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) that is involved in the mRNAribosome binding step of eukaryotic protein synthesis.
Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 by mTOR is dissociated from
eIF4E, resulting in increasing protein synthesis [11]. As
a single agent, pemetrexed decreased phosphorylation of
S6 and 4E-BP1 in H460, H157 and H1155 cells, but to a
lesser extent than rapamycin as a single agent. Combining
rapamycin with pemetrexed decreased phosphorylation of
4E-BP1 and increased hypophosphorylated forms of 4EBP1, but the effects of the combination on phosphorylation
of S6 were less apparent because rapamycin was highly
effective at inhibiting S6 phosphorylation as a single agent
(Figure 2). These results suggested that the combination of
rapamycin and pemetrexed enhances the inhibition of the
mTOR pathway, but also raised the possibility that other
molecular targets might be responsible for the combined
anti-proliferative effects.
An increased basal level of TS expression is
recognized as a mechanism of resistance to pemetrexed
[8, 9]. Pemetrexed has been reported to inhibit TS activity
in NSCLC patients [15], but high concentrations of
pemetrexed can induce TS expression in A549 cells [16].
To clarify the effects of pemetrexed on TS expression,

RESULTS

two concentrations of pemetrexed were used in four
NSCLC cell lines (Figure 3A). Our results show that
pemetrexed potently induced TS expression, because 100
nM increased TS expression in all four cell lines. To assess
the effects of combining rapamycin and pemetrexed,
simultaneous administration for 24 hr and sequential
administration (rapamycin for 24 hr followed by the
addition of pemetrexed for 24 hr) were compared (Figure
3B). As a single agent given for 24 hr, pemetrexed induced
TS expression and modestly decreased phosphorylation of
S6K in the three cell lines tested. Rapamycin as a single
agent markedly decreased S6K phosphorylation in all
cell lines tested, and modestly decreased the basal level

of TS in H157 cells. When rapamycin and pemetrexed
were administered simultaneously, rapamycin only
modestly decreased the expression of TS that was
induced by pemetrexed, suggesting that pretreatment
with rapamycin might prevent pemetrexed-induced TS
expression to a greater extent. Indeed, pretreatment of
cells with rapamycin substantially improved its ability to
inhibit pemetrexed-induced increases in TS expression.
Collectively, these findings suggest that rapamycin
might increase the efficacy of pemetrexed by preventing
pemetrexed-induced TS expression.
To determine if the combination of rapamycin and
pemetrexed has enhanced anti-tumor effects, athymic

DISCUSSION

NCr-nu/nu mice bearing established H460 (Figure 4BD) or H157 (Figure 4E-G) tumor xenografts were treated
with either vehicle, 2.5 mg/kg rapamycin, 100 mg/
kg pemetrexed, or the combination (Figure 4A). The
treatment schedule was designed to allow for a three day
window of rapamycin pretreatment prior to simultaneous
treatment. The combination was well tolerated and
decreased H460 tumor growth by nearly 70%, which was
greater than inhibition due to either drug alone (p <0.0001,
Figure 4B). The staining for the nuclear-specific antigen
Ki67 revealed a significantly lower rate of proliferation
in combination-treated H460 tumors (p <0.0001, Figure
4C). Pemetrexed-induced TS expression in tumors was
suppressed by rapamycin (p <0.05, Figure 4D), and 4EBP1 phosphorylation was decreased by the combination.
A further decrease in phosphorylation of S6 was not
observed in tumor tissues, which is likely the result of
effective inhibition of S6 phosphorylation by rapamycin
alone. In H157 tumors, the combination of rapamycin
and pemetrexed was also effective, decreasing growth by
nearly 80% (p <0.0001, Figure 4E) and inhibiting cellular
proliferation (p <0.0001, Figure 4F). As observed in H460
tumors, rapamycin also suppressed pemetrexed-induced
TS expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry
(p <0.05, Figure 4G) (immunoblotting was not possible
due to fixation of the tumors). These data suggest that
rapamycin improves the inhibition of NSCLC tumor
growth by preventing pemetrexed-induced expression of
TS.

We investigated new approaches to enhance the
efficacy of pemetrexed, and found that the combination
of rapamycin and pemetrexed showed synergistic antiproliferative effects in NSCLC cells and enhanced
mTOR inhibition, as demonstrated by decreases in the
phosphorylation of the downstream components of
this pathway such as 4E-BP1. Furthermore, rapamycin
prevented pemetrexed-induced TS expression in vitro and
in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe
the benefit of using an mTOR inhibitor to suppress the
induction of TS that occurs as a compensatory response
to pemetrexed in lung cancer model systems. Similar
results have been reported in gastric cancer cell lines.
Shigematsu, et al. reported that rapamycin decreased the
endogenous expression levels of TS in gastric cancer cell
lines, which enhanced chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity
[17]. Additionally, RAD001, a derivative of rapamycin,
also decreased endogenous TS protein levels in gastric
cancer cell lines. The combination of RAD001 with the
anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil significantly decreased TS
protein levels to a greater extent than with RAD001 alone
[18]. Collectively, these studies suggest that in general,
mTOR inhibition is an effective way to decrease TS
expression and increase the response to pemetrexed.
Despite the efficacy of the combination in the
NSCLC cell lines we tested, our results are in conflict
with those of Markova et al. [19], who showed that
RAD001 protected NSCLC cells from pemetrexed-

induced apoptosis. They concluded that mTOR inhibitors
might suppress the antitumor activity of pemetrexed by
slowing cell cycle progression. What might explain this
discrepancy? In our study, the combination of rapamycin
and pemetrexed showed synergistic effects in H460 and
H1975 cells that have PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha) mutations,
and in H157 and H1155 cells that have PTEN (phosphatase
and tensin homolog) mutations. Each of these mutations
leads to increased mTOR activity. In contrast, the NSCLC
cell lines used by Markova et al. do not have PIK3CA or
PTEN mutations. To further evaluate PIK3CA or PTEN
mutations as predictive for response to the combination,
we evaluated the effects of combining rapamycin with
pemetrexed with other human NSCLC cell lines that do
not have PIK3CA or PTEN mutations (H1703 and PC-9
(formerly known as PC-14) cells). Rapamycin did not
enhance the efficacy of pemetrexed in these cell lines (data
not shown). This is consistent with the results of MericBernstam et al., who reported that human cancer cells with
PIK3CA and/or PTEN mutations were more likely to be
sensitive to rapamycin [20]. Taken together, these findings
suggest that PIK3CA or PTEN mutations contribute to
the synergistic effects of combining rapamycin with
pemetrexed.
Several reports show that pemetrexed-resistant
lung cancer cell lines treated for 2 to 6 months have
significantly increased levels of TS protein compared
to the parental cell lines [8, 21]. On the other hand, we
found that short-term pemetrexed treatment induced
TS expression, which was suppressed by rapamycin.
Pretreatment of cells with rapamycin prior to
administration of pemetrexed enhanced the suppression
of pemetrexed-induced TS expression compared to the
combination without rapamycin-pretreatment (Figure
3B). What mechanisms might underlie inhibition of TS by
rapamycin? Because rapamycin inhibits protein synthesis,
it is likely to suppress the translation of ribosomeassociated TS transcripts that are induced by pemetrexed.
In addition, Lee et al. reported that the mechanism of TS
protein down-regulation by RAD001 might be dependent
on proteasomal degradation, because the treatment of a
proteasome inhibitor blocked the down-regulation of TS
protein by RAD001 [18]. Future studies might clarify
the roles of the each of these mechanisms and/or identify
additional mechanisms of TS suppression by mTOR
inhibition.
The results of these studies have clinical
implications. TS may be a valuable target in NSCLC.
For example, Kaira et al. reported that positive TS
expression in tumor tissues from 160 patients with
completely resected NSCLC was significantly associated
with advanced stage and lymph node metastases, and was
an independent prognostic factor for predicting a poor
outcome in patients with lung adenocarcinoma [22]. A
recent meta-analysis that evaluated the predictive value of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TS in pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy regimens for
NSCLC patients suggests that increased levels of TS are
an independent risk factor for potential resistance against
pemetrexed [10]. Early clinical trials combining mTOR
inhibitors with pemetrexed have been completed. A phase
I study of RAD001 given simultaneously with pemetrexed
in previously treated NSCLC patients has been reported,
and the regimen was well tolerated with a 42% disease
control rate (partial response (PR) and stable disease) [23].
These results are similar to what might be expected for
pemetrexed alone, but biomarkers and TS levels were not
analyzed in this study. A hypothetical advantage of using
rapamycin includes the fact that rapamycin can protect
normal cells from the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
agents and radiation-induced damage, but sensitize cancer
cells to these therapeutic modalities [24, 25]. We recently
completed a Phase I/II clinical trial combining rapamycin
and pemetrexed in patients with relapsed NSCLC who had
any number of prior treatments, and found that the regimen
was well tolerated with a 22% PR rate (manuscript in
preparation). We incorporated a one-week lead in period
with rapamycin alone for pharmacokinetics and biomarker
analysis. Immunoblotting analysis of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells collected from patients showed that
rapamycin alone decreased the level of endogenous
expression of TS, which correlated with progression free
survival and was consistent with our preclinical results
[26]. These results suggest that the maximum clinical
benefit of combining mTOR inhibition with pemetrexed
might be achieved through a lead in period with mTOR
inhibition alone. In addition, future studies should assess
basal levels of TS expression in tumor tissue and stratify
patients based on status of PIK3CA and PTEN to validate
potential predictive markers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture.
NSCLC (H460, H157, and H1155) cell lines with
Kras mutations were established at the National Cancer
Institute (NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA), and the NSCLC
H1975 cell line with EGFR mutations was a kind gift
from Dr. William Pao (Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center,
Nashville, TN, USA). All cell lines were maintained in
75 cm2 flask in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Life Technologies) at 37○C in a 5.0% CO2 atmosphere
incubator. LKB1 mutations are detected in H460 and
H157 cell lines. The mutation status of NSCLC cells
was obtained from Cell Line Project, Catalog of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), the Wellcome Trust

tumors were allowed to thaw on ice, then homogenized
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0)] containing 2.5 mol/L
h-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 mol/L sodium orthovanadate,
1.25 mol/L sodium fluoride, and 1 x protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
using a hand-held Tissue-Tearor homogenizer (Biospec
Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA). Cell lysates or tumortissue homogenates with equal amounts of protein were
separated by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 hr in
blocking buffer (1 x TBS, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20)
and placed in primary antibody diluted in 1 x TBS, 5%
bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, overnight at
4°C. The following day, membranes were washed thrice
in wash buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 1 x TBS). Primary
antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase–
linked secondary antibodies and visualized with the
enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham
Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Immunoblot
experiments were performed at least 3 times.

Rapamycin and pemetrexed were obtained from LC
Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). Primary antibodies
for P-4E-BP1 (Ser65), 4E-BP1, P-S6 Ribosomal Protein
(Ser235/236), S6 Ribosomal Protein, thymidylate synthase
(TS), P-p70 S6 Kinase (Thr389), and p70 S6 Kinase were
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
Anti-α-Tubulin and Ki67 antibodies were from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO, USA) and Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA),
respectively.

Cell proliferation assay and Combination Index
(CI).
NSCLC cells (2,500 cells per well) were plated
in 96-well plates and allowed to grow overnight. Cells
were treated with rapamycin dissolved in DMSO,
pemetrexed dissolved in PBS, or the combination in a
wide concentration range between 0.01 nM and 10000
nM for 72 hr (H460 and H1155 cells) or 96 hr (H157
and H1975 cells). Growth inhibition was determined
by the sulforhodamine B assay [27]. Percent growth
value was calculated by using the absorbance values of
untreated cells on day 0 (D0), DMSO-treated control
cells (C), and drug-treated cells (T) as follows: [(T - D0)/
(C - D0)] x 100 for concentrations for which T>/=D0, or
[(T - D0)/C] x 100 for concentrations for which T<D0.
Experiments were performed three times, and each
drug concentration was evaluated in sextuplet wells for
a given experiment. CI is a quantitative measure of the
degree of drug interaction in terms of synergism (CI < 1),
additive effect (CI = 1), or antagonism (CI > 1) for a given
endpoint of the effect measurement [28]. Additive effect
is defined as the combined effect predicted by the massaction law principle, synergism is as the production of a
greater than expected additive effect, and antagonism is
as the production of smaller than expected additive effect.
Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) and Combination
Indices (CIs) were calculated using CompuSyn software
program (ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA). Affected
fraction (Fa) is defined as a function of effect level (e.g.,
degree of inhibition) by a dose of drug. Fa values were
calculated according to the program’s instruction as
follows: [(100 - % growth value)/100], which indicated a
growth inhibition value.

Drug treatment in vivo.
Six-week-old female athymic NCr-nu/nu mice
(Charles River Labs, Frederick, MD, USA) were injected
subcutaneously (s.c.) in both rear flanks with 5 x 106 H460
or H157 cells in 100 µl PBS. When the transplanted tumors
reached a volume of 50 mm3, mice were divided into the
following four groups (5 mice per group): intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of either (1) vehicle (4% DMSO, 5% PEG,
5% Tween 80 in saline; once daily on days 1, 4 to 7, and
11 to 14), (2) 2.5 mg/kg rapamycin (once daily on days 1,
4, 7, 11, and 14) as described previously [14], (3) 100 mg/
kg pemetrexed (once daily on days 4 to 6 and 11 to 13)
based on tolerated dosage as described previously [30], or
(4) the combination of rapamycin and pemetrexed (once
daily on each drug’s schedule). Animal weights and tumor
measurements were made every other day. In all studies,
tumor volume was calculated from the formula v = (ab2) /
2, where a is the long axis and b is the short axis. In vivo
experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by
the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee.

Immunohistochemistry.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded xenograft
tumor tissues were sectioned, placed on poly-Llysine–coated slides (Histoserv Inc., Germantown,
MD, USA), and analyzed for protein expression for
five mice per group. Antigen retrieval was carried out
using preheated target retrieval solution (pH 6.0) from
DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 30 min in
a boiling rice cooker. Vectastain Elite ABC kits from

Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA) were used
according to manufacturer’s instructions for blocking,
dilution of primary antibody, and labeling. Primary
antibody was incubated with sections for 16 hr at
4°C. 3,3- Diaminobenzidine was prepared fresh from
tablets (Sigma). Specificity of staining was assessed
by comparison with samples stained in the absence
of primary antibody. All slides were blinded to the
investigators before scoring, and in all cases, xenograft
tumors were assessed for three to five mice per group.
The staining index of TS was determined by assigning a
score of absent (0), minimal (1), moderate (2), or high (3)
staining to each cell in five 400-highpower fields (HPF).
The staining index was then calculated by multiplying the
staining intensity by its distribution scored as 0 (0%), 1
(1% to 20%), 2 (21% to 40%), 3 (41% to 60%), 4 (61%
to 80%), 5 (81% to 100%) to indicate the percentage of
positive cells of interest in a single core. Ki67 staining was
quantified by counting the number of the positive cells in
five 400-HPF per tumor. Numbers were averaged for three
to five mice per group. An overall score was assigned to
each slide, and the scores were averaged for vehicle versus
drug-treated groups.

Statistical significance of differences observed in
drug-treated and untreated cells was analyzed using oneway/two-way ANOVA, and then multiple comparisons
were performed by Bonferroni test. All analyses were
performed using the GraphPad Prism software version
5.0c. The threshold value was set to 0.05.
