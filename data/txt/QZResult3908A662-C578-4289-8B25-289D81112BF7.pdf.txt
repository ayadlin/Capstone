BACKGROUND. Nuclear p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) were reported to be
poor prognostic indicators for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The
authors sought to determine the prognostic value of nuclear p53 and pRb in
superficial bladder transitional cell carcinoma patients who were treated with
intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or BCG with interferon-alpha (IFN-a).

METHODS. A prospective histological review was performed for 80 superficial
bladder transitional cell carcinoma patients who underwent postresection intravesical regimes of BCG (81mg, n ¼ 33 or 27 mg, n ¼ 20) or BCG (27 mg) with

IFN-a (n ¼ 27), and followed for a mean of 4.5 years. Hematoxylin and eosin (H

regression, and Kaplan-Meier curves.

RESULTS. pRb expression was not associated with patient outcome after BCGalone therapy, but pRb underexpression was significantly associated with BCG
nonresponse and tumor recurrence (P ¼ .047) after BCG and IFN-a (BCG þ IFNa) therapy. Low-grade tumors were associated with pRb overexpression, with or
without nuclear p53 underexpression (P ¼ .019; P ¼ .043, respectively). p53
expression alone or in combination with pRb expression had no significant relation with tumor response to BCG alone or BCG þ IFN-a with respect to recurrence, progression, or cancer-specific death.

CONCLUSIONS. Nuclear pRb underexpression may be predictive of nonresponse
and cancer recurrence after intravesical BCG þ IFN-a therapy. Nuclear p53
expression or its combination with pRb expression is not associated with postBCG clinical outcome, so p53 expression or p53 with pRb expression should not
be used to influence decisions concerning BCG-alone or BCG þ IFN-a therapy.

T

he majority of transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder
are superficial at the time of diagnosis. After initial transurethral
resection, about 60% to 70% of these tumors will recur, and about 15%
to 25% of patients will progress to invasive bladder cancer.1,2 Transurethral resection followed by intravesical administration of bacille
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is currently the most effective treatment for
superficial bladder cancer.3,4 However, side effects of BCG therapy are
common, and approximately one-third of patients fail to respond.

One of the most common genetic abnormalities
observed in bladder cancer is that of p53 mutation,
which results in increased half-life and accumulation
of nonfunctioning p53 nuclear protein.5,6 Alterations
of nuclear retinoblastoma protein (pRb) expression
have also been suggested to be a prognostic indicator
in patients with transitional cell carcinomas of the
bladder.7
Some studies have shown that the overexpression
of p53 and the loss of pRb expression are predictive
of tumor recurrence, progression, or survival in
patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of
the urinary bladder.8–16 Conversely, other investigators have found that these nuclear protein alterations
were not independently prognostic for tumors.16–19
There is, however, a scarcity of studies that report the
prognostic predictive value of p53 and pRb status after bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical therapy
for superficial bladder transitional cell carcinomas,
and none after BCG plus interferon-alpha therapy.
We conducted a prospective study to determine
the correlation between p53 and pRb expression and
the clinical outcome of superficial bladder transitional cell carcinoma patients treated with intravesical BCG, with and without interferon-alpha.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 93 patients who underwent transurethral
resection for high-risk superficial transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder were enrolled prospectively
into this study. Specimens from initial pre-BCG transurethral resection of bladder tumors were obtained
from all patients for p53 & pRb immunoassay. They
were then randomized to receive 1 of 3 forms of intravesical BCG (Connaught strain), with the regime comprising an induction course of 6 once-a-week
instillations, followed by 6 weeks rest, and a booster
course of 3 more once-a-week instillations. The 3
groups were a standard dose (81 mg) BCG group, a 13
dose (27 mg) BCG group, and a 13 dose (27 mg) BCG
plus 10 million units of interferon-alpha 2b. All
patients had given written informed consent. The
study was approved by our institutional review board.
The patients were followed by cystoscopy and
urinary cytological examination every 3 months for
the first year and every 6 months thereafter; bladder
biopsy and urinary cytological examinations were
performed when indicated. The cutoff date used
when calculating follow-up duration was that of the
last cystoscopy date.
Tumor staging and grading were assigned
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Tumor recurrence was defined as

the occurrence of any new focus of superficial transitional cell carcinoma, and tumor progression was
defined as the presence of invasive tumor during the
follow-up period. Those who were recurrence-free
and progression-free at 6 months and thereafter were
defined as responders. Patients with recurrent tumors were treated with transurethral resection, and
patients with tumor progression were offered radical
cystectomy.
Sections of 4 lm in thickness were cut from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from the
biopsies of bladder tumors. These were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and were assessed and histologically graded by 2 pathologists in an independent
and blinded fashion. A 3-grade system was used. In
cases with a difference in grade, a consensus grade
was achieved.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining for retinoblastoma
(pRb) and p53 proteins was performed with a polyclonal rabbit antihuman antibody (Retinoblastoma
antibody; Lab Vision, Calif), and a monoclonal
mouse antihuman antibody (p53 protein antibody;
Clone DO-7; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), respectively,
using the Dako EnVision system. Deparaffinized and
rehydrated 4-lm histological sections were pretreated by microwaving them in citric acid (pRb) or
in Dako Target Retrieval Solution (p53 protein) at pH
6.0 at 988C for 20 minutes. Endogenous peroxide activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10
minutes. The sections were then incubated with pRb
antibody diluted at 1:150 or p53 protein antibody
diluted at 1:500 for 1 hour. After washing in tris buffered saline (TBS) solution for 10 minutes, the sections
were incubated with polymer solution (Dako K4011 for
pRb; Dako K4007 for p53 protein) for 30 minutes and
then washed again in TBS solution. Diaminobenzidine
(DAB) solution was applied, and the colored product
was allowed to develop before counterstaining and
mounting were performed. Tissues from breast carcinoma and gastric carcinoma served as positive controls
for pRb and p53 protein, respectively.
Scoring of pRb and p53 protein staining was performed by 2 pathologists in an independent and
blinded fashion. Only nuclear staining was considered for scoring, with the extent of staining and the
intensity of staining scored separately. Scores of 0, 1,
2, and 3 were assigned for no staining, staining of 1%
to 5% of nuclei, staining of 6% to 50% of nuclei, and
staining of >50% of nuclei, respectively. The intensity
of staining was scored from 0 to 3, with 0 for no
staining, 1 for weak staining intensity, 2 for moderate
staining, and 3 for the most intense staining (Fig. 1).

nuclear pRb staining intensity 1 (weak staining), (D) nuclear pRb staining intensity 2 (moderate staining).

In cases with a difference in score, a consensus score
was achieved. By using a combination of extent and
intensity, p53 overexpression was defined as having a
total extent and intensity score of 4 to 6, and pRb
overexpression was defined as having a total score of
3 to 6. Scores of 3 (for p53 staining) and 2 (for
pRb staining) were considered to denote underexpression.
All analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0
(SPSS, Chicago, Il) with statistical significance set at
P < .05. Univariate analysis (chi-square test and/or
Fischer exact test) and multivariate analysis (logistic
regression) were used to correlate p53 and pRb nuclear staining score with tumor stage, grade, BCG
response and tumor recurrence, tumor stage progression, cancer-specific death, and nonspecific death,
both on the whole as well as stratified by treatment

arm. Time to recurrence, progression, and diseasespecific survival time were analyzed by the KaplanMeier method.

RESULTS
Seven patients defaulted follow-up, 3 patients died,
and 3 patients underwent cystectomy for muscleinvasive disease, within 3 months of recruitment,
and none of these patients were evaluable for outcome analysis. For the remaining evaluable 80
patients, patient and tumor characteristics, both
overall and stratified by treatment group, are summarized in Table 1. The mean patient age and sex
distribution were similar across the 3 treatment
groups. For all patients, the percentage distribution
of p53 overexpression (38.8%) was also similar to the

Nineteen (23.8%) patients had pretreatment stage Ta
disease, 39 (48.8%) patients had pretreatment stage
T1 disease, and 22 (27.5%) patients had carcinoma in
situ (CIS). Evaluable patients were followed for a
mean of 4.5 years (range, 6 to 114 months). There
were 5 deaths from cancer-specific causes at a mean
of 24 months (range, 12 to 42 months), of which 3
occurred in the standard dose (81 mg) BCG therapy
group and 2 occurred in the combination BCG–interferon-alpha therapy group. There were also 15 deaths
from noncancer-specific causes at a mean of 52.6
months (range, 15 to 108 months), of which 4
occurred in the standard dose group, 8 occurred in
the low-dose BCG group, and 3 occurred in the combination BCG–interferon-alpha therapy group.
Tumor characteristics (stage and grade) were analyzed according to p53 and pRb nuclear expression,
and these characteristics are shown in Table 2. p53
nuclear expression alone was not significantly associated with tumor stage and grade, when we ana-

lyzed both overall and when stratified according to
treatment group. Nuclear pRb overexpression was
more likely to occur in early grade (grade 1) tumors
(P ¼ .043; relative risk [RR] ¼ 1.8; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 1.1–2.9). When analyzed according
to a combination of p53 and pRb expression, early
grade (grade 1) tumors were significantly more likely
to have both nuclear p53 underexpression and pRb
overexpression, compared with the other combinations of p53 and pRb expression (P ¼ .019; RR ¼ 2.1;
95% CI, 1.2–3.6).

cally significant predisposition to tumor nonresponse
to BCG therapy and cancer recurrence (P ¼ .047;
RR ¼ 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5). The other combinations
of p53 and pRb expression were also analyzed
according to treatment outcome and found to be not
significant (data not shown). Overall, the combination of p53 and pRb nuclear expression also did not
predict for patient outcome after BCG-alone therapy
or BCG þ interferon-alpha therapy.
By using the Kaplan-Meier method, we plotted
actuarial disease-related survival according to tumor
recurrence, disease progression, and disease-specific
survival, respectively, and p53 expression, pRb
expression, and combined p53 and pRb expression.
Only recurrence-free survival is shown in Figure 2.
There were, however, no significant survival trends
shown for disease progression and disease-specific
survival (data not shown), or recurrence as a whole,
for nuclear p53 and pRb expression, or their combination. Subgroup survival analysis was not performed, as the number in each treatment group was
too small for comparison between clinical outcomes
and p53 or pRb expression.

DISCUSSION
The correlation between p53 expression in superficial
bladder cancer and response to therapy is controversial. Conflicting findings have been reported with
respect to superficial bladder cancer progression.

Some studies have reported that p53 nuclear expression status alone, or combined with other factors
such as p16 or p21, influenced the progression rate
and/or the disease-specific survival of patients with
superficial bladder cancer.8–15,20,21 However, other
investigators have been unable to show that p53
overexpression is an independent predictor of either
disease progression or patient survival (Table 4).16–19
The prognostic value of nuclear p53 immunoreactivity in relation to BCG therapy for high-risk superficial bladder cancer is also debatable. Some
studies have shown that p53 overexpression was possibly associated with high risk of progression, recurrence, and cancer death after BCG therapy22–24.
However, other groups have found no such correlation between p53 expression and disease outcome
after BCG therapy (Table 4).25–29
Correlation between the number of loci with loss
of heterozygosity, leading to nuclear pRb underexpression, and bladder cancer stage and grade was
shown by 1 group.30 This group also demonstrated
that altered pRb function was found in lower tumor
stage and grade as well. Some investigators have
found that pRb immunoreactivity alone was not significantly associated with recurrence or progression
in superficial bladder cancers.18,20 However, other
authors have reported that patients with abnormalities of both pRb and p53 expression in superficial
bladder cancers had higher progression and lower
survival rates than did those with normal expression

of both genes, thus suggesting additive effects
between the 2 genes.15,16,20 Currently, there are very
few reports on the predictive value of pRb immunoreactivity in relation to BCG therapy for superficial
bladder transitional cell carcinomas (Table 4).31
The definition of p53 overexpression has largely
been arbitrary. Lacombe et al, and several subsequent authors, defined p53 overexpression in bladder
cancer as having nuclear immunostaining extent
with a cutoff value of 20%.22 Yet, others have used
6%, 10%, 15%, or >20%, as a cutoff value to define
overexpression (Table 4).8–9,11–21,24 The definition of
pRb expression abnormality has also been arbitrary.
In some studies, pRb expression abnormality has
been defined as having an immunostaining extent of
either 0% or >50%.16,20 In our study, we defined the
extent of p53 and pRb immunoreactivity by using a
scoring system that assigned scores to ranges 0%, 1%
to 5%, 6% to 50%, and >50%, respectively. Some
technical difficulty with pRb staining, because of variability of staining quality, was encountered, thus
making score assignment difficult at times. This was
partly overcome by a consensus score for cases with
a difference in scoring. This technical difficulty was,
however, not seen for p53 staining. Unlike many studies, we also took into account the intensity of
immunoreactivity for both p53 and pRb, consistent
with other studies that have evaluated their expression abnormalities in organ systems other than bladder cancer.32–38 The final composite score comprised
both extent and intensity components. We believe
that this composite scoring system, together with the
assignment of a narrower range for p53 overexpression (score 4–6) and pRb underexpression (score 0–
2), possibly allows a better definition of abnormalities of p53 and pRb expression, thus providing more
rigor in examining the correlation between these
abnormalities and clinical outcome.
In our study, we did not find any correlation
between nuclear p53 expression alone and tumor
stage or grade. However, pRb overexpression alone,
and the combination of p53 underexpression and
pRb overexpression, reflecting the combined effect of
2 favorable factors, was seen to be associated with
low-grade tumors. A statistical limitation of this
study is the relatively small sample size, which prevented us from making adjustments to the multiple
comparisons performed in this study.
In contrast to some studies, we found no definite
relationship between pretreatment p53 expression
and patients’ outcome after BCG immunotherapy (Table 4). Although p53 expression may possibly have importance in the natural history of superficial
transitional cell carcinoma development, our results

also reveal that patients with p53 expression abnormalities who were treated with BCG do not have poorer
outcome compared with those without p53 expression
abnormality. In our study, the combination of p53 and
pRb expression, even with the combinations that are
expected to give the best (p53 underexpression and
pRb overexpression) and worst outcomes (p53 overexpression and pRb underexpression), also did not show
significant relation to treatment outcomes. Hence, in
our opinion, abnormalities in p53 expression or its
combination with pRb expression should not be a reason for excluding patients with superficial transitional
cell carcinomas from BCG therapy (Table 4).
In our study, nuclear pRb expression alone did
not predict cancer recurrence, progression, or cancerspecific survival after BCG-alone therapy. However,
compared with those patients who received BCG
alone, patients who received BCG and interferon treatment had pretreatment pRb underexpression that was
significantly associated with treatment response and
cancer recurrence. Interferon-alpha is known to stimulate a host response against bladder cancer, possibly by recruiting immune cells. A possible explanation
is that in addition to immunomodulation, interferon
may also have a direct effect on tumor cells, possibly
by inducing an increase in the expression of the inactive unphosphorylated pRb, thereby inhibiting tumor
cell-cycle progression. This was suggested by a study
that looked at involvement of pRb in the growth-regulatory actions of IFN-a by using IFN-a growth-sensitive
human Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells.39 Treatment of
Daudi cells with IFN-a significantly induced pRb protein expression, predominantly as underphosphorylated pRb, by 3-fold to 10-fold, and IFN-a mediated
induction of pRb was an early event that preceded the
appearance of growth-inhibitory responses and G0/G1
phase arrest of Daudi cells. The mechanism of the
observed IFN-a–mediated induction of pRb, however,
remains to be delineated. With earlier studies suggesting that pRb is regulated at the protein level by phosphorylation, there may be a different mechanism of
IFN-a–induced effect on bladder cancer at the posttranslational level, compared with immune-mediated
changes in expression and/or modification of specific
cellular regulatory gene products, resulting in tumor
growth inhibition by IFN-a.40,41 Hence, pRb underexpression in bladder cancer cells may reduce the direct
effect of interferon on the tumor cells, thus accounting
for the selective response in tumors treated by BCG and
interferon.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we found in this study that nuclear
expression of p53 or its combination with pRb expres-

sion was not predictive of response to intravesical
BCG with or without interferon-alpha, cancer recurrence, progression, or cancer-specific survival. Abnormalities in p53 expression or its combination with
pRb expression should not be a factor precluding
BCG therapy for patients with superficial transitional
cell carcinoma. Overall, nuclear pRb underexpression
alone did not predict cancer recurrence, progression,
or cancer-specific survival after BCG therapy. This
report is the first to describe the possible predictive
value of nuclear pRb underexpression toward cancer
recurrence and nonresponse in patients treated with
intravesical BCG and IFN-a. However, larger studies
are required to support this preliminary finding.
