BACKGROUND: The management of stage I testicular seminoma is evolving rapidly. This study examined modern trends in the management of stage I testicular seminoma and the effects of sociodemographic factors on therapy choice. METHODS: Data from the
National Cancer Data Base on 34,067 patients with stage I testicular seminoma who were treated between 1998 and 2011 were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with adjuvant management strategies. RESULTS:
For patients with stage IA/B testicular seminoma, rates of observation after orchiectomy increased from 23.7% to 54.0%, the receipt
of adjuvant chemotherapy increased from 1.5% to 16.0%, and the receipt of radiotherapy decreased from 70.8% to 28.8%. A similar
pattern was seen in stage IS testicular seminoma, although these patients were more likely to receive adjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy (60.7% vs 44.8% for stage IA/B in 2011, P <.001). For patients with stage IA/B testicular seminoma, observation after orchiectomy was more common in racial minorities (odds ratio [OR] for blacks vs whites, 1.31, P <.001; OR for Hispanics vs whites, 1.39,
P <.001) and in the uninsured (OR for uninsured vs privately insured, 1.33, P <.001) and less common at community centers (OR for
community centers vs National Cancer Institute–designated cancer centers, 0.80, P 5.044). In those with stage IA/B testicular seminoma who received adjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy, the receipt of chemotherapy was more common at academic centers and
for patients with nonprivate insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Postorchiectomy observation in stage I testicular seminoma has increased
significantly in recent years, as has the receipt of chemotherapy, whereas the receipt of radiotherapy has declined, particularly at academic centers. Race, insurance status, and facility type are strongly associated with the choice of adjuvant management. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Although representing less than 1% of male cancers, testicular seminoma is the most common solid tumor histology seen in
patients aged 15 to 35 years.1,2 More than three-quarters of patients present with stage I disease, and disease-specific survival
for such patients treated in controlled clinical trials exceeds 98%.3 After orchiectomy and appropriate staging, data from large
prospective trials and cohort studies support the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or close surveillance.4-13
Although evolving national practice guidelines support each of these management options for patients with stage IA/
B disease, close surveillance after orchiectomy has been recommended as the preferred method of management.14 For
patients with stage IS disease, adjuvant radiation therapy has historically been the standard of care, although the most
appropriate management strategy for these patients has become less clear more recently.14 Although these recommendations and the data on which they are based are useful in guiding care providers, appropriate application on a national level
can vary in comparison with the carefully selected cohorts present within clinical trials and large academic center experiences. In addition, factors such as the socioeconomic and insurance status as well as the facility type may influence the choice

of adjuvant management. Historical data on national
practices in the United States have been reported; however, data on modern practice patterns are lacking.15 We
sought to investigate modern approaches to management
in patients with stage I testicular seminoma and to correlate these adjuvant strategies with relevant clinical variables with the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

The NCDB is a hospital-based registry jointly sponsored by
the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer
Society that serves as a comprehensive clinical surveillance
resource capturing approximately 70% of incident cancers
in the United States each year. Ongoing validation of data
accuracy and quality is performed through internal monitoring, site surveys, and data quality reviews.16 Data coding
methods have been described previously.17-19 Institutional
review board approval was obtained to conduct this study.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

We extracted data on individuals with a new diagnosis of
pure testicular seminoma (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology [Third Edition] histology: 9060-9064)
between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2011 who had
part of or their entire initial treatment course at a Commission on Cancer–accredited facility. Patients identified as stage
IA, IB, or IS were included. To simplify the planned analyses,
patients with IA and IB disease were grouped together per
National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines. A total of 34,067 patients met the study criteria.
Variable Definition

Race was categorized as non-Hispanic white, Hispanic,
black, or other. The region of residence was recorded per
the 4 US Census regions. Patient insurance was categorized as private, Medicaid, Medicare, uninsured, or other.
Facility type and volume designations have been described
previously.17,20 Patients receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy within 6 months of orchiectomy as part of their
first course of treatment were categorized as such. Patients
not receiving such therapy were categorized as receiving
observation after orchiectomy.
Statistical Analysis

Linear trend tests were conducted to analyze the significance of changes in practice patterns over time. Chi-square
tests were used to compare categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables
associated with a treatment paradigm of interest. A 2-sided
682

P value < .05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses
were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median
age at diagnosis was 37 years. Nearly 80% of the patients
were categorized as non-Hispanic white. Patients were
predominantly insured by private insurers; however,
8.4% of the patients were uninsured, and 8.6% of the
patients were insured by Medicare or Medicaid. A majority of the patients (59.4%) were treated at communitybased centers, with 27.6% receiving care at academic centers (teaching/research hospitals or National Cancer Institute [NCI]–designated cancer centers). Patients were
categorized as stage IA (68.8%), IB (27%), or IS (4.1%).
Management Trends

Trends in the management of stage IA/B disease during the
study period are shown in Figure 1; tabulated data are available
in Supporting Table 1 (see online supporting information). In
1998, radiotherapy was the predominant adjuvant therapy
and was received by 70.8% of the patients. Observation was
received by 23.7% of the patients, whereas 1.5% received
chemotherapy. These rates remained stable until 2005 when a
steady increase in the receipt of observation and chemotherapy
and a concomitant decline in radiotherapy occurred. By 2011,
observation after orchiectomy became the predominant adjuvant management strategy and was received by 54.0% of
patients, whereas 28.8% of patients received radiotherapy and
16.0% received chemotherapy (P for linear trend < .001). For
those patients treated with radiotherapy, the median and
mode radiation dose was 25.5 Gy, and this did not change significantly over the study period (data not shown).
Trends in the management of stage IS disease are
shown in Figure 2 and are also available in Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting information). The general
trends toward increased receipt of chemotherapy and
decreased receipt of radiotherapy mirrored those for the
patients with stage IA/B disease. In 2011, stage IS patients
were more likely, however, than stage IA/B patients to
receive some form of adjuvant treatment rather than observation (40.2% received radiotherapy, and 20.5%
received chemotherapy vs 44.8% adjuvant radiotherapy
or chemotherapy for those with stage IA/B; P < .001).

stage IA/B disease (Table 2). In comparison with those
who were <25 years old, older patients were more likely
to receive adjuvant treatment, although this effect was
statistically significant only for patients in the 35- to 39year age group (odds ratio [OR] for receipt of observation,
0.87, P 5 .011) and the 40- to 44-year age group (OR for

patients were significantly more likely to receive observation (OR for blacks 1.31, P < .001; OR for Hispanics,
1.39, P < .001; OR for patients of other races, 1.33,
P < .001). Patients insured by Medicare (OR 1.55,
P < .001) and those who were uninsured (OR 1.33,
P < .001) were also more likely to be observed. The
receipt of observation was less common outside academic
centers (OR for community centers, 0.87, P 5 .044 versus
NCI-designated cancer centers; OR for community-based
comprehensive cancer centers, 0.80, P < .001 versus
NCI-designated cancer centers). Facilities with a lower
seminoma case volume overall were more likely to observe
patients after orchiectomy (OR, 1.20 for medium-volume
centers vs high-volume centers, P < .001; OR for lowvolume centers vs high-volume centers, 1.55, P < .001).
Finally, patients with T2 disease (OR, 0.72, P < .001) or
T3 disease (OR, 0.62, P < .001) were less likely to receive
observation in comparison to patients with T1 disease, as
were patients with tumors 4 cm or larger (OR, 0.78,
P < .001).
A second model was constructed for the 21,475
patients with stage IA/B disease who received adjuvant
radiotherapy or chemotherapy (Table 3). In this model,
patients  50 years old were significantly more likely to
receive radiation versus chemotherapy (OR 1.29,
P 5 .037 in comparison with patients < 25 years old).
Patients with nonprivate insurance were significantly less
likely to receive radiotherapy versus chemotherapy (OR
0.66 for uninsured patients, P < .001; OR 0.53, P < .001
for patients with Medicaid; OR 0.73, P 5 .014 for
patients with Medicare). In comparison with NCIdesignated cancer centers, receipt of radiotherapy was
more common at all other center types. An increasing T
stage was also associated with lower utilization of radiotherapy in favor of chemotherapy (OR for T2 versus T1,
0.72, P < .001; OR for T3 versus T1, 0.38, P < .001).
DISCUSSION
In this, the largest study to date to report modern practice
patterns in the care of patients with stage I testicular seminoma in the United States, we identify significant recent
changes in adjuvant management strategies. Between
1998 and 2011, we identified a greater than doubling of
patients who received observation after orchiectomy,
although the use of radiation therapy remained a common
practice. As previously noted, a growing body of evidence
supports the use of close surveillance in patients with stage
I seminoma; however, randomized data are lacking.4,8,1013
The desire to avoid adjuvant treatment stems not only
from the high cure rates with primary orchiectomy and

the high rates of successful salvage therapy in those who
experience recurrence but also from a growing understanding of the potential long-term morbidities of radiotherapy such as sexual dysfunction, cardiac disease, and
radiation-associated cancers.21-27 Novel radiotherapy
delivery modalities and techniques may, however, serve to
reduce these risks.28,29 A previous study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, which
included data up to 2004, demonstrated that the preference for surveillance in stage I patients has been growing
steadily since at least 1990.30 Data from our study, however, suggest that the most significant changes in national
management trends have occurred since 2005. Our find684

ings demonstrate the need for continued study of these
trends and their potential effect on patient outcomes due
to the magnitude of the observed changes during the last
few years of the study period.
In our study, the receipt of observation after orchiectomy was independently associated with socioeconomic,
facility, and individual cancer risk factors. Minority
patients and uninsured patients with stage I disease were
significantly less likely to receive adjuvant therapy in the
multivariate analysis. These findings are not surprising
because of extensive data suggesting that racial minorities
and those without adequate insurance coverage often lack
sufficient access to medical care.17,20,31,32 As such, there is

concern that although such patients may technically be
scored as receiving guideline-preferred management, they
may in fact be receiving substandard care because of a lack
of appropriate follow-up imaging and examinations,
although a lack of follow-up data in the NCDB prevents
the formation of a firm conclusion.
Compared to patients with stage IA/B disease treated
at academic centers, patients treated at community-based

centers were less likely to undergo surveillance after orchiectomy. Individual center volume was also associated with
management choice, with lower volume centers more
likely to offer surveillance. These data are important
because the majority of patients with seminoma in the
United States receive their care at community-based centers. Many such centers may have a long experience with a
single treatment paradigm (particularly radiotherapy) and

so may favor this approach for most if not all of their
patients. Alternatively, factors such as dependence on the
referring physicians for future referrals and other financial
considerations may influence treatment choice in small
community practices.33 The finding that factors such as an
increased T stage and tumor size are associated with a
decreased utilization of surveillance is consistent with the
application of longstanding data showing higher relapse
rates for patients with certain adverse pathologic features.34 Indeed, many centers have advocated a riskadapted approach and have offered surveillance only to
those patients without such risk factors.4,35 This approach,
however, remains controversial, with some centers favoring surveillance for all patients with stage I disease.
More recently, several large studies have identified
single-agent carboplatin as an alternative to adjuvant radiotherapy for those with stage I seminoma.5,36 This approach
is thought to have similar efficacy and possibly certain
advantages over radiotherapy, including potentially
reduced toxicity, ease of administration, and reduced cost.
In our study, rates of chemotherapy use increased by an
order of magnitude between 1998 and 2011, with the
major increase beginning again around 2005; this corresponds to the initial publication of a randomized trial comparing single-agent carboplatin to radiotherapy.6 Although
carboplatin may be used in hopes of reducing the late morbidity associated with radiotherapy, long-term data are
lacking, and what data do exist suggest that patients treated
with chemotherapy, even at low doses, are still at risk for
significant late toxicity.21,23,25,37
In our study, a major factor predicting the receipt of
chemotherapy over radiotherapy was nonprivate insurance.
A single dose of chemotherapy may be attractive to those
concerned about the costs of care associated with close
follow-up (including serial imaging) and/or the higher costs
associated with radiotherapy. The other major factor predictive of receiving chemotherapy was the receipt of treatment at an NCI-designated cancer center. Because novel
treatment trends are often first adopted at such centers, it is
very likely that rates of chemotherapy use will only continue to increase in the future as this approach gains traction in the community. As such, continued careful
monitoring and collection of long-term toxicity data are
vital to assess the appropriateness of this trend.
In our study, we also identified increasing use of
chemotherapy in patients with stage IS disease. Although
this change appears to mirror that in patients with stage
IA/B disease, it is important to note that this subgroup
was specifically excluded from the aforementioned
randomized trial of carboplatin versus radiotherapy.5
686

Indeed, because some patients with IS disease may harbor
occult nodal disease, use of carboplatin in this setting is
problematic because of poor outcomes for such therapy in
more advanced patients.38 Although adjuvant radiotherapy has long been the standard of care in IS seminoma,
these patients are also typically excluded from
radiotherapy-based clinical trials.7,9 As such, continued
study is needed to identify the most appropriate management strategy for this subgroup.
Our study has several limitations, including those
common to any large, retrospective database study such as
the potential for miscoding of data, missing data, and unidentified confounding factors. The NCDB also does not
capture information on some important pathologic factors such as rete testis invasion and the type of chemotherapy administered (such that single-agent carboplatin
cannot be distinguished from other regimens). We are
also unable to comment on the extent and appropriateness
of follow-up care, including the use of serial imaging. Despite these limitations, the large amount of data collected
nationwide by the NCDB does allow the formulation of
reliable and generalizable commentary on many important factors associated with management.
In conclusion, this large study based on data accumulated across US treatment center types demonstrates
rapidly changing practice patterns for patients with testicular seminoma. We identify significantly increased utilization of observation after orchiectomy and chemotherapy
for patients with stage I disease. Sociodemographic factors, including race, insurance status, and facility type and
volume, appear to affect the choice of management. Additional study and analysis of long-term outcomes, particularly in unique subgroups such as patients with IS disease,
are needed to validate these findings and confirm the
appropriateness of these trends.
