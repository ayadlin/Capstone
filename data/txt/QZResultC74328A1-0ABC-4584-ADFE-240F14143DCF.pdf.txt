ABSTRACT
This work describes the effectiveness of HDAC-inhibitor (S)-2 towards colorectal
cancer (CRC) HCT116 cells in vitro by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and
in vivo by contrasting tumour growth in mice xenografts. Among the multifaceted
drug-induced events described herein, an interesting link has emerged between the
oncoprotein histone deacetylase HDAC1 and the oncogenic Cancerous Inhibitor of
Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) which is overexpressed in several cancers including
CRCs. HDAC1 inhibition by (S)-2 or specific siRNAs downregulates CIP2A transcription
in three different CRC cell lines, thus restoring the oncosuppressor phosphatase PP2A
activity that is reduced in most cancers. Once re-activated, PP2A dephosphorylates
pGSK-3β(ser9) which phosphorylates β-catenin that remains within the cytosol where
it undergoes degradation. The decreased amount/activity of β-catenin transcription
factor prompts cell growth arrest by diminishing c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression and
abrogating the prosurvival Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These results are the
first evidence that the inhibition of HDAC1 by (S)-2 downregulates CIP2A transcription
and unleashes PP2A activity, thus inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in CRC cells.

INTRODUCTION

generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of caspase
cascade, disruption of mitochondrial integrity, increase in
autophagy [10], and suppression of pro-survival pathways
[14, 15]. These events were at least in part mediated by
acetylation of histones and nonhistone key regulatory
proteins [16] including p53, GATA1, GATA2, retinoic acid
receptor, NF-kB and cytoskeletal proteins like a-tubulin
[17–19].
Previously, we described a new series of HDACis
generated through the hybridization of 1,4-benzodiazepine
(BDZ) ring with SAHA or oxamflatin [20] yielding
compounds that displayed powerful anticancer properties
against human malignant cells of acute myeloid leukemia
[21], prostate adenocarcinoma [22], metastatic melanoma
[15] and, notably, were safe to normal mice in vivo up to
high dosages [15, 21].
The study herein aimed at evaluating the
effectiveness of a specific HDACi, termed (S)-2, towards
human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells HCT116 (and
partly also HT-29 and HCT8) in vitro and at describing
mechanisms underlying drug-induced cell growth arrest

Epigenetic changes are reversible rearrangements
of chromatin capable of modulating gene expression in
the cell without altering DNA sequence. Acetylation is
the most widely studied post-translational modification of
histones [1] and results from the balanced activity of two
families of enzymes, namely the histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyzing
acetylation/deacetylation of histones, respectively, and
thereby providing DNA accessibility to transcription
factors [2–5].
In cancer cells HDACs are typically overexpressed
[6–9] and represent, therefore, the targets for diverse
natural/synthetic compounds acting as HDAC-inhibitors
(HDACis) [10–12]. Some of them have successfully been
used in the clinic, either alone or in combination with
conventional cytotoxics, as potent antineoplastic drugs
to support current therapy [10, 11, 13]. Indeed, HDACis
have proven effective in promoting cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in various types of tumours through the

(S)-2 modulates the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling
pathway

and apoptosis. Moreover, the drug showed to be also
effective in vivo by contrasting HCT116 cell growth in
mice xenografts.
Our results point to a crucial involvement of
serine/threonine phosphatases and, in particular, of their
physiological inhibitors, as mediators of anticancer
properties of (S)-2 in CRC cells. Furthermore, these
findings disclose a new role for HDAC1 in governing
transcription of the oncogenic Cancerous Inhibitor of
Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) that is known to be
overexpressed in numerous cancers [23, 24] including
CRCs [25]. To our knowledge, such a molecular link
between HDAC1 and CIP2A has not been reported
previously and may help, therefore, to understand the
widespread anticancer effectiveness of several HDACis,
including (S)-2, that recognize HDAC1 as a specific target.

An activating mutation of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is a key oncogenic event occurring in almost all
CRCs [26, 27]. Due to this specific alteration the GSK3β-mediated degradation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm is
inhibited and this allows the protein accumulation of in
the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor [28]. It
seemed interesting, therefore, to explore the effectiveness
of (S)-2 on GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in
HCT116 cells. Immunoblot analyses of total cell extracts
from cultures incubated up to 48 h with 5 µM (S)-2
showed a time-dependent decrease in the levels of both
pGSK-3β(ser9) and active-β-catenin (Figure 2A). The
evaluation of active β-catenin amounts in total cell lysates
as well as in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions after 48
h of treatment proved that the drug caused a significant
decrease of total active-β-catenin that, however, was
mainly confined to the nucleus (Figure 2B). Furthermore,
as c-Myc and cyclin D1 are well-known target oncogenes
of β-catenin transcriptional activity [26, 28] we monitored
their expression following treatment without/with 5 µM
(S)-2 for 24 h and 48 h, and observed a significant druginduced decrease of mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2C,
top and bottom panel, respectively).

RESULTS
(S)-2 prompts growth arrest and apoptosis in
HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells
The BDZ-hydroxamate hybrid (S)-2 was assayed
for its HDAC-inhibitory activity by using the human
colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as the primary model.
Western blot analyses showed that incubation of cultures
with 5 µM (S)-2 enhanced histone H3 acetylation and
prompted de novo acetylation of both H4 and α-tubulin
(Figure 1A). These effects were observed as early as at
6 h and remained steady up to 48 h of treatment, and
were accompanied by a dose-dependent cell growth
arrest (Figure 1B). Moreover, typical HCT116 culture
monolayers underwent morphological changes upon
incubation with (S)-2 that induced a marked cell
detachment from the substrate, while the residual attached
cells displayed a fairly enlarged phenotype (Figure 1C).
In addition, a 48 h-exposure of HCT116 cultures to 5 mM
(S)-2 modified cell cycle progression as indicated by
a nearly three-fold increase of cells arrested in G2/Mphase relative to control, and a large decrease of cell
population in S-phase (from about 37% of controls to
7.2% of treated cultures) (Figure 1D). Besides, about
half of HCT116 treated cells underwent apoptosis as
assessed by flow cytometry at 48 h (Figure 1E, top);
and consistently, western blots analyses of cell extracts
from drug-treated cultures showed that (S)-2 caused
the cleavage of caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), a well-known pro-apoptotic marker
(Figure 1E, bottom). Moreover, to clarify mechanisms of
drug-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells, we used the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk that was added in culture
at 30 mM concentration just 2 h prior to a 24 h-treatment
without/with 5 µM (S)-2. The inhibitor abolished (S)-2mediated activation of caspase cascade and the cleavage of
PARP thus indicating that the apoptotic process developed
through a caspase-dependent pathway (Figure 1F).

PP2A, rather than PP1, plays a role in drugmediated GSK-3β dephosphorylation
Once determined that (S)-2 induced GSK-3β
activation through serine dephosphorylation, it was
important to identify which serine/threonine protein
phosphatases could actually be involved. As the bulk of
cellular serine/threonine phosphatases is represented by
PP1 and PP2A phosphatases [29], their roles in drugmediated pGSK-3β(ser9) dephosphorylation in HCT116
cells have been investigated with the aid of siRNAs.
Western blots of lysates of cells transfected with either
PP1 or PP2A specific siRNAs for 24 h and then incubated
for additional 24 h without/with 5 µM (S)-2 demonstrated
that the down-regulation of PP1 and PP2A led to a marked
increase in pGSK-3β(ser9), but only the down-regulation
of PP2A was really effective in abrogating drug-induced
dephosphorylation of pGSK-3β(ser9) (Figure 3A). These
data were confirmed by experiments carried out with
Cantharidin, a chemical inhibitor of PP2A [30], that was
added at 50 µM concentration to HCT116 cell cultures 2
h prior to a 24 h-treatment without/with (S)-2. Cantharidin
alone prompted a marked increase in pGSK-3β(ser9) and
also abolished drug-induced dephosphorylation of pGSK3β(ser9) and PARP cleavage thus blocking the apoptotic
process (Figure 3B). Moreover, further information on
mechanisms responsible for (S)-2-mediated activation of
PP2A were provided by monitoring the expression of its
endogenous cellular inhibitors, i.e. the inhibitor 2 of protein

phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A) and the cancerous inhibitor of
protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) [31]. Relative mRNA
levels of both I2PP2A and CIP2A underwent a significant
time-dependent decrease upon culture treatment with
5 µM drug (Figure 3C). Conversely, immunoblot analyses

showed that while the amount of I2PP2A was steady along
with the experiment, the CIP2A signal decreased at 15 h
and more considerably at 24 h thus suggesting that, indeed,
this was the phosphatase inhibitor playing a major role in
(S)-2-mediated PP2A activation (Figure 3D).

without/with 5 µM (S)-2 and then processed by Western blot and immunostained for the acetylated histone H3/H4 and nonhistone protein
acetyl-α-tubulin, while α-tubulin as such was taken as the loading control. (B) Cells (105/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed
to attach overnight. The day after, increasing amounts of (S)-2 (0, 2.5 and 5 µM) were added to the wells and viable cells (trypan blunegative) were counted with the aid of a Bürker chamber at the indicated time points (results were the mean ± SD of experiments done in
quadruplicate). (C) Phase contrast pictures of companion cultures showed that (S)-2 induced morphological changes and a marked decrease
in cell density (a typical experiment out of three). (D) For cell cycle distribution HCT116 cultures were treated without/with 5 µM (S)-2

the different phases of the cell cycle was calculated by the ModFit program and shown in each panel were reproduced in three separate
experiments. (E) top – Apoptosis in cell cultures treated without/with the drug was also assessed cytofluorimetrically by using the AnnexinV-Fluos/PI assay and the calculated percentages of four different assays yielded comparable values. (E) bottom – Cell extracts of HCT116

were treated without/with 5 µM (S)-2 for 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western immunoblot to detect the cleavage of PARP and of
caspase 9; GAPDH was the loading control.

(S)-2-induced downregulation of CIP2A is
mediated by the inhibition of HDAC1

(Figure 4A), hence suggesting that the drug-induced
decrease of CIP2A could actually develop through the
inhibition of HDAC1. And, notably, similar changes have
also been reproduced in different CRC cell lines such as
HT-29 and HCT8. The direct role of HDAC1 in governing
CIP2A expression in CRC cells has further been confirmed
with the aid of a plasmid harboring the human CIP2A full
length promoter fused with the Luc2 luciferase gene. In
fact, the downregulation of HDAC1 protein signal by
specific siRNA led to a significant decrease of mRNA
levels of Luc2 (Figure 4B) due to the silencing the CIP2A
promoter in all the three CRC cell lines.

The drug-mediated decrease of CIP2A expression
in HCT116 cells has clearly indicated that HDACs were
involved in the regulation of this particular gene; and,
therefore, we evaluated the effects of specific siRNAs
towards the nuclear histone deacetylase HDAC1 that
we previously reported to be a sensitive target of (S)-2
[21]. Western blot analyses showed that HCT116 cells
treated without/with either 5 µM (S)-2 and/or specific
HDAC1 siRNA led to a decrease in CIP2A protein signal

nuclear compartment, respectively. (C) mRNA and protein levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 in HCT116 cells treated without/with 5 µM (S)-2

(S)-2 greatly reduces HCT116 cell proliferation
in mice xenografts

volumes of (S)-2-treated mice were significantly smaller
(average ± 30 %) than those of untreated mice (Figure 5A,
top). Besides, tumour masses of untreated mice were
hyperemic and underwent ulceration, whereas those of
drug-treated mice did not burst and remained fairly pale in
color to suggest that tumour growth elicited only a modest
angiogenesis (Figure 5A, bottom).
Immunohistochemistry of tumour specimens was
performed to determine in vivo effects of (S)-2 (Figure 5B).
We found that the drug exerted its activity within the
tumour cells as shown by (a) the presence of acetyl-H3
and γ-H2AX (the latter denoting drug-induced caspase
activation and DNA damages) and (b) the marked decrease,
as compared to untreated mice, in the amount of tumour
cells positively-stained with MIB-1 (against the nuclear
marker Ki-67 associated with cell proliferation [32–34].

To assess the in vivo anticancer effectiveness of (S)-2
in a xenograft tumor model, HCT116 cells were implanted
onto both flanks of nude mice (see legend to Figure 5 and
Materials and Methods for details). A week later, a small
swelling was perceived under the skin of some of the
animals which were assumed as positively-xenografted
mice which were randomized into two groups and then
injected ip with either the drug or the vehicle (DMSO).
Treatments were administered three times a week for the
first two weeks and twice in a row on the last week when
mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Changes in
tumour volumes during along with the experiment were
monitored by measurements with a caliper. Tumour mass

injected ip with either the drug or DMSO as the vehicle. Treatments were administered three times a week for the first two weeks and twice
in a row on the last week when mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Variations in the tumour volumes along with the experiment
and after the sacrifice were measured by a caliper. (A) bottom – Excised tumours were weighed and volumes were calculated according to
the formula (length (mm)) × (width (mm)) × (depth (mm)) × p/6. Statistical analyses of changes in tumour volumes (mean ± SD) after 0,
3, 6 and 8 treatments were as follows: [for untreated mice: #0 (25.7 ± 10.0); #3 (103.3 ± 20.6); #6 (201.7 ± 64.2); #8 (188.6 ± 62.1)] and
[for treated mice: #0 (28.2 ± 11.7); #3 (76.1 ± 25.5); #6 (128.6 ± 26.5); #8 (142.2 ± 24.7)]. According to these values the drug was capable
of reducing tumour volumes of about 26.4% (1st week), 36.2% (2nd week) and 24.6% (3rd week), as compared to control. Photographs
are representative of tumour masses from mice treated with either the vehicle or (S)-2, respectively. (B) top – Immunohistochemistry
was performed on specimens of human colon cancer xenografts by using primary antibodies against acetyl-H3 and γ-H2AX, and also

were counterstained with aqueous Meyer hematoxylin and mounted with glycerol for visual inspection and photography. (B) bottom –

DISCUSSION

the activity of canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway. Results
herein (see the schematic diagram, Figure 6) show that
the inhibition of HDAC1, by either (S)-2 or specific
siRNA, downregulates CIP2A and, therefore, restores
the activity of PP2A that dephosphorylates pGSK3β(ser9). Upon activation, GSK-3β phosphorylates
b-catenin that remains confined to the cytosol where it
undergoes degradation. The decreased amount/activity
of the b-catenin transcription factor induces cell growth
arrest by diminishing c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression
and abrogating the prosurvival Wnt/b-catenin signaling
pathway as well. This is the first time that a direct effect
of HDAC1 on CIP2A transcription is reported to occur
in HCT116, HT-29 and HCT8, thus inferring that this
molecular link might be an original signature shared by
various types of CRC cells. In this context, the HDACi
(S)-2 represented the tool capable of unleashing PP2A
activity by inducing HDAC1-mediated downregulation of
CIP2A transcription in human colon cancers.

The anticancer properties of (S)-2 towards CRC
cells have been thoroughly described in the previous
section. Indeed, the drug induced cell cycle arrest and
caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells and also
proved effective in vivo by contrasting tumour growth
in mice xenografts. However, moving beyond a plain list
of all biological and molecular events characterizing the
anticancer activity of (S)-2 in CRC cells, we would focus
on a specific result that emerged during this study. HDAC1
is an oncogenic protein acting as a transcription factor of
various genes [35] among which, however, CIP2A was
not included previously. CIP2A is also an oncoprotein
overexpressed in several cancers including CRCs [25, 36]
where it inhibits the activity of oncosuppressor PP2A that
controls cell cycle and apoptosis [36–39]. PP2A inhibition
suppresses the dephosphorylation of pGSK-3β(ser9), thus
inhibiting b-catenin degradation and then maintaining

Figure 6: Schematic diagram of (S)-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells. The oncogenic

protein HDAC1 acts as a transcription factor for CIP2A that afterward complexes and inactivates PP2A. The latter becomes unable to
dephosphorylate pGSK-3β(ser9) thus allowing the translocation of β-catenin in the nucleus where it induces the transcription of c-Myc
and cyclin D1 and, consequently, cell proliferation. The inhibition of HDAC1 by (S)-2 leads to the downregulation of CIP2A expression
and, thus, restores the activity of PP2A that dephosphorylates pGSK-3β(ser9). The activated kinase GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin
that undergoes degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The decrease in β-catenin levels downregulates c-Myc and cyclin D1
expression and, consistent with this, leads to cell growth arrest.

antibodies; the ECL procedure was employed for
development. Western immunoblots reported all through
this work were the mean ± SD of experiments carried out
in triplicate (unless otherwise specified) and the software
ImageJ [41] was used for densitometric quantification of
protein band intensity.

Cell culture and treatments
Human colon cancer cells HCT116 (CCL-247,
ATCC), HT-29 (HTB-38, ATCC) and HCT8 (CCL-244,
ATCC), have been cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, EuroClone, Life
Science Division, Milan, Italy) and 2 mM L-glutamine
at 37ºC in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. (S)-2 was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich,
ST. Louis, MO, USA) at 0.1 M concentration and stored in
the dark at room temperature (RT). Working drug solutions
were obtained by appropriate dilution of the stock solution
with the culture medium. The amount of DMSO employed
as vehicle did not interfere with drug biological activities.
In caspase inhibition experiments Z-VAD-fmk (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was added in culture
2 h prior to treatment with (S)-2. Cantharidin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) used to inhibit
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity was dissolved
in DMSO at 0.1 mM final concentration and stored in
–20ºC; the inhibitor, at the established concentrations, was
delivered to cultures 2 h prior to treatment.

Quantitative real time-PCR analysis
QRT-PCR was performed with reverse transcripted
cDNA of either untreated or drug-treated cells by using the
Applied Biosystems 7500HT System according to standard
protocols. Fold of c-Myc, cyclin D1, I2PP2A and CIP2A
induction were calculated by the changes of each of their Ct
values in treated vs. untreated cells and were normalized to
the 18S rRNA Ct values. Amplification was performed with
the default PCR setting: 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and of
60°C for 60 sec using a SYBR Green based detection (SYBR
Green Master mix; Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the following primers:

Cell cycle analysis and determination of
apoptosis
Cell cycle phases were assessed by the propidium

measured by the Annexin-V-Fluos/PI test (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) with the
aid of Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur System (BectonDickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) [21].

siRNAs and plasmids transfection
In silencing experiments, 2 × 105 cells were seeded
in 60 mm culture dishes 16 h before transfection with
siRNAs using 7.5 µl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). PP1 (mix of
500 pmol of each #105828 targeting PPP1CA, #104504
targeting PPP1CB and #105829 targeting PPP1CC), PP2A
(mix of 500 pmol of each #104510 targeting PPP2CA
and #104717 targeting PPP2CB), HDCA1 (500 pmol of
#120418) and non-targeting control siRNA (500 pmol of
#4390844) were from Thermo Fisher Scientific. In overexpression experiments, 2 × 105 cells were seeded into
60 mm dishes 16 h before co-transfection with 2.5 μg of
plasmid 1082CIP2ALuc-pGL4.10 (kind gift of Professor
Jukka Westermark, University of Turku and Abo Akademi,

Fitchburg, WI, USA) and 2.5 μg pGL4.70 (Promega)
using 7.5 µl of Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Thermo

Western blotting
Harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mM
RIPA buffer (pH 7.4) containing a cocktail of proteinase
inhibitors (Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
and treated by sonication (Microson XL-2000, Minisonix,
Farmingdale, NY, USA) to obtain a total protein extract.
For cytosol-nucleus fractionation, proteins were isolated by
using the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction
Kit (Calbiochem) as suggested by the manufacturer.
Proteins were assayed by the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), analyzed by SDSPAGE and western blotting as reported elsewhere [40].
Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against
acetyl-H3, acetyl-H4, active-β-catenin, and PP2A (Upstate

on both flanks of 24 mice. A week later the tumour mass
was perceived in 14 mice (out of those originally injected),
which were then randomized into two equal groups and
treated with the drug or the vehicle at the established
times. Changes in tumour volumes during the experiment
were monitored by regular measurements with a caliper.
Eventually, mice were killed by cervical dislocation and
tumours were excised, weighed and their volumes were
calculated according to the formula (length (mm)) × (width
(mm)) × (depth (mm)) × p/6.

Slides with consecutive 2.5–5 µm sections of paraffin
embedded tumour masses were first deparaffinized, boiled
in 1 mM EDTA pH 9 for 15 min and after cooling aspecific
peroxidases were blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. Then,
slides were treated according to standard procedures and
incubated with primary antibody solutions against acetyl-H3
and γ-H2AX (to denote drug-induced caspase activation
and DNA damages); and also with the monoclonal
antibody MIB-1 (recognizing the nuclear marker Ki- 67
that was associated with cell proliferation) (Dako,
Glostrup, Danimarca) [33, 34] followed by a peroxidaseconjugated IgG preparation; 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA,
USA) was used as the chromogen for development. Slides
were counterstained with aqueous Meyer hematoxylin
and mounted with glycerol for visual inspection and
photography; pictures are representative of four randomly
chosen microscopic fields (magnification: ×400) and taken
with the aid of a microscope (Nikon Eclipse, mod. 50i)
equipped with a digital camera (DS-5 M USB2) (Nikon
Instruments, Florence, Italy) as described previously [22].
