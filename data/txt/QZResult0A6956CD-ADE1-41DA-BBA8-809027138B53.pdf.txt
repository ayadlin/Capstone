ABSTRACT
We investigated cell cycle regulation in acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing
the FLT3-ITD mutated tyrosine kinase receptor, an underexplored field in this disease.
Upon FLT3 inhibition, CDC25A mRNA and protein were rapidly down-regulated, while
levels of other cell cycle proteins remained unchanged. This regulation was dependent
on STAT5, arguing for FLT3-ITD-dependent transcriptional regulation of CDC25A.
CDC25 inhibitors triggered proliferation arrest and cell death of FLT3-ITD as well
as FLT3-ITD/TKD AC-220 resistant cells, but not of FLT3-wt cells. Consistently, RNA
interference-mediated knock-down of CDC25A reduced the proliferation of FLT3ITD cell lines. Finally, the clonogenic capacity of primary FLT3-ITD AML cells was
reduced by the CDC25 inhibitor IRC-083864, while FLT3-wt AML and normal CD34+
myeloid cells were unaffected. In good agreement, in a cohort of 100 samples from
AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, high levels of CDC25A mRNA were
predictive of higher clonogenic potential in FLT3-ITD+ samples, not in FLT3-wt ones.
Importantly, pharmacological inhibition as well as RNA interference-mediated
knock-down of CDC25A also induced monocytic differentiation of FLT3-ITD positive
cells, as judged by cell surface markers expression, morphological modifications, and
C/EBPα phosphorylation. CDC25 inhibition also re-induced monocytic differentiation in
primary AML blasts carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation, but not in blasts expressing wild
type FLT3. Altogether, these data identify CDC25A as an early cell cycle transducer of
FLT3-ITD oncogenic signaling, and as a promising target to inhibit proliferation and
re-induce differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells.

stages of the myeloid differentiation [1]. The impact of
several mutations has been explored this last decade, one
of the most frequent being the internal tandem duplication
(ITD) in the juxta-membrane domain of the Fms-Like
Tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which leads to constitutive

activation of this receptor [2]. This mutation is particularly
associated to normal karyotype [3] and now takes part
to the most recent prognostic classification of AML [4].
During normal myeloid hematopoiesis, FLT3 is highly
expressed and was reported to play an important role at
the granulo-monocyte progenitor level [5].
Because of the high frequency of this mutation (25–
30% of AML) and of its associated negative prognostic
[3, 6], several FLT3 inhibitors have been consequently
developed and tested in different clinical trials, either
as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy
[7–12]. These molecules have a negative impact on
AML cells proliferation in vivo, and interestingly, their
pro-differentiation effect was also reported clinically,
suggesting that inhibiting FLT3-ITD could partially
relieve the differentiation arrest occurring in this category
of AML [13]. Recent studies identified the ERK kinase
and the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 as important
players of FLT3-ITD AML differentiation arrest through
phosphorylation of the C/EBPα transcription factor on its
serine 21 [14–16], suggesting that CDK or ERK inhibitors
could restore the differentiation program of these cells.
CDC25A is a dual specificity phosphatase
involved in cyclin-dependent kinases activation during
the cell cycle. CDC25A has important functions during
replication and mitosis, as well as during the G1 phase
of the cell cycle. CDC25A is finely regulated both at
the transcription and protein levels [17], and moderate
variations of its cellular level affect genomic stability and
oncogenic transformation process [18]. CDC25A knockout is lethal at an early stage of embryonic development.
Its overexpression was described in different categories
of cancers, and was often associated with an adverse
prognosis [19]. However, there is almost no study
dealing with CDC25A status in AML or in other myeloid
malignancies. CDC25A expression is increased by
leukemic cells adhesion to fibronectin, and participates
to the adhesion-dependent increased proliferation of
these cells [20]. CDC25A is also constitutively expressed
downstream of oncogenic tyrosine kinases, including
NPM-ALK and BCR-ABL [21], as well as JAK2 V617F
in myeloproliferative neoplasms [22].
In this work, we demonstrate that CDC25A is
an early target of FLT3-ITD oncogenic signaling, and
is an important player of AML cells proliferation and
differentiation arrest.

upon FLT3-ITD inhibition in MV4-11 and MOLM-14,
two AML cell lines carrying FLT3-ITD mutation. Two
unrelated pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 (FLT3
inhibitor III and the potent new generation inhibitor
AC220, quizartinib) induced CDC25A down-regulation in
these cell lines (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1a)
in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S1b).
Neither other members of the CDC25 phosphatase family
CDC25B and CDC25C, nor key cell cycle regulators as
cyclin A, cyclin D1 or p27Kip1 were significantly modified
in these conditions (Figure 1a). Cell cycle distribution of
AML cells was not changed after two hours in the presence
of FLT3 inhibitor III (not shown), indicating that CDC25A
down-regulation was not a consequence of cell cycle arrest.
The efficiency of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD expressing
cell lines was ascertained by the inhibition of Akt, STAT5
and ERK phosphorylation, three pathways activated
downstream of FLT3-ITD (Supplementary Figures S1a
and S1c). In good agreement, we also observed CDC25A
down-regulation in response to FLT3-ITD inhibition in the
murine cell line BaF3 constitutively expressing FLT3-ITD
(Supplementary Figure S1d). Importantly, FLT3 inhibitor
did not decrease CDC25A protein level in FLT3-wild type
leukemic cell lines KG1 and HL-60 or in the FLT3 nonexpressing cell line K562 (Figure 1b).

Mechanisms of CDC25A regulation downstream
of FLT3-ITD
We then investigated which signaling pathway was
involved in CDC25A regulation. As shown in Figure 2a,
a STAT5 inhibitor significantly reduced CDC25A protein
level in MV4-11 and MOLM-14 cells after 2 hours. This
was not the case in KG1 and HL-60 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2a), nor in TF-1 cells, another leukemic cell
line expressing wild type FLT3, upon different culture
conditions, including stimulation by GM-CSF, IL-3
or G-CSF (Supplementary Figure S2b). By contrast to
STAT5 inhibition, neither Akt nor ERK inhibition induced
such down-regulation of CDC25A in FLT3-ITD positive
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2c and S2d), suggesting
that STAT5 is the major pathway leading to CDC25A
regulation downstream of FLT3-ITD. In good agreement
with these data, siRNA-mediated STAT5 knock-down
induced CDC25A protein down-regulation in MOLM-14
and MV4-11 cells, confirming the results observed with
pharmacological inhibition (Figure 2b).
Since STAT5 is a transcription factor, we then
estimated variations of CDC25A mRNA level by
quantitative RT-PCR in response to FLT3-ITD inhibition.
Inhibiting FLT3-ITD for two hours significantly reduced
CDC25A mRNA level in MOLM-14 cells (Figure 3a),
suggesting that STAT5 could be a transcriptional regulator
of CDC25A downstream of FLT3-ITD. Since modifications
of CDC25A protein stability have been often described, we
measured half-life of CDC25A protein in the presence of

significantly increase the stability of CDC25A in this model.
Altogether, these data suggest that CDC25A transcription is
regulated by STAT5 down-stream of FLT3-ITD.

did not induce accumulation in any specific phase
of the cell cycle (not shown). Since this inhibitor
has similar efficiencies on CDC25A, CDC25B and
CDC25C, we then performed RNA interference
experiments to estimate the specific impact of
CDC25A on FLT3-ITD+ cells proliferation. As shown
in Figure 4c and in Supplementary Figure S3b, RNA
interference-mediated down-regulation of CDC25A,
performed with two independent siRNA targeting the

down-regulation of CDC25A had negligible effect on
KG1 cells (Supplementary Figure S3c), confirming
that FLT3-ITD positive cells are more dependent on
CDC25A than FLT3-ITD negative ones.
We then measured the impact of CDC25 inhibition
on the proliferation of AML primary cells from patients.
The main biological characteristics of the samples used in
these experiments are depicted in Table 1. The clonogenic
potential of FLT3-ITD primary cells in semi-solid
5637-conditionned medium was significantly reduced in
the presence of IRC-083864 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4d, upper panel), while cells expressing wildtype FLT3 (Figure 4d, lower panel) were not sensitive
to CDC25 inhibition. Similar results were obtained with
a semi-solid medium containing recombinant growth
factors GM-CSF, FLT3 ligand, and IL-3 (Supplementary
Figure S3d). In addition, the IC-50 of IRC-083864
on CD34+ cells purified from bone marrow of healthy
donors was >500 nM (not shown), much more higher

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

than for FLT3-ITD AML cells (see Figure 4d). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that leukemic cells
expressing FLT3-ITD are highly dependent on CDC25A
for their proliferation.

FLT3-ITD/TKD expressing cells are resistant to
AC220 but remain sensitive to CDC25 inhibition
In recent clinical trials performed with pharmaco­
logical FLT3 inhibitors such as quizartinib or sorafenib
[24], heterogeneous mechanisms were suggested to
contribute to FLT3 inhibitors resistance, and among them
FLT3 kinase domain mutations were the most frequently
reported [25]. We consequently developed a cellular model
consisting of MOLM-14 cells transfected with a FLT3ITD mutant with a D835Y amino-acid substitution within
the FLT3 kinase domain (FLT3-ITD-D835Y; FLT3-ITD/
TKD) (see Supplementary Methods). In MOLM-14 and
in MOLM-14 expressing FLT3-ITD/TKD, treatment with
1nM AC220 induced low levels of cell death (not shown),

proliferation arrest and cell death similar to that observed

expression. Since CDC25A appears as an important actor
of cell proliferation in FLT3-ITD cells (see Figure 4), we
looked for correlations between CDC25A expression and
clonogenic potential in FLT3-ITD patients. Clonogenic
assays were performed at diagnosis for 151 patients.
We first restricted our analysis to the intermediaterisk cytogenetic group (n = 100) where FLT3-ITD has
its prognostic significance. As shown in Table 2, high
CDC25A mRNA levels nicely correlate with higher
clonogenic potential in FLT3-ITD patients, while this
is not the case in FLT3-wt ones. Similar results were
obtained in the normal karyotype subgroup (n = 67).
These data suggest that high CDC25A expression confers
proliferation advantage to FLT3-ITD positive cells.

FLT3-ITD primary cells
We then investigated the expression level of
CDC25A mRNA in a cohort of 188 non-promyelocytic
AML young patients (aged 18–65) treated by intensive
chemotherapy in Toulouse University Hospital in the
2000–2010 period. The characteristics of this cohort are
detailed in Supplementary Methods and in Supplementary
Tables S1–S3. CDC25A mRNA expression was divided
into low expression and high expression according to
the median value of the entire cohort. We observed no
difference in the expression of CDC25A between FLT3wt and FLT3-ITD patients. FLT3-ITD allelic ratio or

differentiation through its CDK1 activating function. To
test this hypothesis, MV4-11 and MOLM-14 cells were
treated with lower dose 100 nM IRC-083864, and the
differentiation of these cells was followed by cell surface
markers expression and by morphological modifications at
different times. As shown in Figure 5a, expression of the

inhibition. After 8 days of treatment, the monocytic
marker CD14 was increased in both cell lines (Figure 5b)
while the granulocytic marker CD15 either decreased
or did not change significantly at that time. These data
suggest that CDC25 inhibition relieves the differentiation
block and drives a monocytic differentiation process in

FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines. Morphological analyses
revealed monocytic-like nuclear changes in cells treated
with IRC-083864 for 8 and 13 days (Figure 5c), consistent
with modifications of surface markers expression. In good
agreement, IRC-083864 also induced dephosphorylation
of C/EBPα on serine 21, a phosphorylation catalyzed by
CDK1 and/or ERK and involved in the differentiation
arrest of these cells (Figure 5d). CDC25 inhibition
also induced c-myc down-regulation at day 1 and C/
EBPε up-regulation at day 6, two additional markers of
myeloid differentiation. As a confirmation of these data,
modifications of CD11b, CD14 and CD15 expression
as well as nuclear morphological changes were also
observed with another CDC25 inhibitor, NSC-95397
(Supplementary Figure S4).
In order to further confirm the role of CDC25A in
this differentiation arrest, we performed RNA interference
mediated down-regulation of the protein. We first used
siRNA-mediated CDC25A down-regulation, which
led to nuclear morphological modifications at day 3 in
MOLM-14 cells (Figure 5e). To confirm these data, we
performed lentiviral infection of MOLM-14 cells with
an shRNA targeting CDC25A. As shown in Figure 5f,
down-regulation of CDC25A induced CD11b and CD14
expression 3 and 6 days after infection respectively, while
CD15 expression was decreased, confirming the data
obtained by pharmacological inhibition and further arguing
for the implication of CDC25A in the differentiation
process. Consistently, morphological nuclear modifications
were observed at day 6 after infection (Figure 5g).
We then asked whether CDC25 inhibition could
induce differentiation of primary AML samples expressing
either FLT3-ITD or wild-type FLT3. As shown in
Figure 6a and 6b, the monocytic-specific differentiation
marker CD14 increased while CD15 expression was not
modified after 6 days of treatment of FLT3-ITD primary
cells with IRC-083864. Consistently, monocytic-like
morphological nuclear changes were observed at days 6
and 9 of CDC25 inhibition in these FLT3-ITD expressing
cells (Figure 6c). Similar results were obtained after
treatment with the other CDC25 inhibitor NSC-95397
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Supplementary Figure S5a and S5b), while no evidence of
differentiation was observed in FLT3-wild type samples in
the same conditions (Supplementary Figure S5c and S5d).
Altogether these data demonstrate that inhibiting
CDC25A reduces proliferation and induces monocytic
differentiation of FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell lines and
primary cells, and they argue for a central role of this
phosphatase in the hematopoietic differentiation arrest of
these cells.

DISCUSSION
Because of high frequency and poor prognosis of
FLT3-ITD mutation, improving the knowledge of this AML
subgroup pathophysiology appears as an essential task for
the next years. Major signaling pathways activated by FLT3ITD have been identified, but downstream effectors, as well
as their respective involvements in cell proliferation and drug
resistance remain to be specified. Large phosphoproteomic
analysis performed in FLT3-ITD expressing cells identified
a panel of potential downstream targets of Pim and Akt,
two well recognized players of FLT3-ITD oncogenic
potential [26], but functional importance of these proteins
in FLT3-ITD AML remained elusive. In this work, we
demonstrate that the dual specificity phosphatase CDC25A,
a major activator of cyclin-dependent kinases during
different phases of the cell cycle, is regulated very early
downstream of FLT3-ITD. Our data argue for a STAT5dependent transcriptional mechanism being at the origin
of this regulation, but we cannot rule out that CDC25A
protein level is also governed at the translational level, as
we recently observed down-stream of JAK2 V617F, another
oncogenic tyrosine kinase involved in myeloproliferative
disease [22]. Transcriptional regulation of CDC25A by
STAT5 has not been reported up to now, but the involvement
of STAT3 in both negative and positive transcriptional
regulation of CDC25A has been described [27]. Different
studies recognized the importance of STAT5 in FLT3-ITD
signaling and leukemic cells transformation [28–30], and
targeting of this pathway constitutes an important axis of
therapeutic research [31]. Further experiments are needed to

better understand CDC25A regulation by STAT transcription
factors in AML cells.
One important feature of this work is that FLT3ITD cells are highly dependent of CDC25A for their
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proliferation. This is true by comparison with FLT3-ITD
negative leukemic cells, but also with normal CD34+
hematopoietic cells, opening the interesting hypothesis
of a therapeutic window for CDC25 inhibitors. To this
38072

Oncotarget

respect, the fact that CDC25 inhibition overcomes the
resistance to FLT3 inhibitors induced by TKD mutation
of FLT3-ITD appears of specific interest, and may
constitute an interesting alternative to the development of
new generation FLT3 inhibitors with higher efficiency on
mutant forms of the receptor.
In this work, we also highlighted a central role for
CDC25A in the differentiation process of FLT3-ITD AML
subtype. Abnormalities of transcription factors-induced
differentiation are observed in one third of AML (PMLRARA, AML1-ETO, CBFβ and C/EBPα). In particular,
mutations in the C/EBPα gene are detected in 10% of
AML with normal karyotype, and C/EBPα plays a key
role in normal granulocytic or monocytic differentiation,
depending on its dimerization partner [32]. Differentiation
arrest in FLT3-ITD AML was recently described to be
dependent on the phosphorylation of C/EBPα on serine
21 by the ERK kinase and/or the mitotic cyclin dependent
kinase CDK1/cyclin B1 [16]. These authors proposed
FLT3-ITD-dependent regulation of cyclin B1 protein as a
key parameter of CDK1 activity, and consequent C/EBPα
phosphorylation and differentiation arrest in this model.
Our work suggests that CDC25A, in addition to cyclin
B1, is another key regulator of CDK1 activity downstream
of FLT3-ITD. This would suggest that FLT3-ITD upregulates CDK1 activity by different ways, both by
CDC25A-dependent dephosphorylation of Thr14/Tyr15,
and by accumulation of cyclin B1 and its subsequent
association with CDK1. The molecular mechanism of
cyclin B1 accumulation in this context, and whether
CDC25A activity could be involved in this process,
remain to be established. CDC25A is involved in different
phases of the cell cycle, and to this respect, is considered
as a regulator of different CDKs. Its role as an activator of
CDK2 and the G1/S transition and during DNA replication
is well established, and its action on the G1 CDK4/CDK6cyclin D1 complex has been recently highlighted [33]. Our
data do not allow to distinguish which CDKs are regulated
by CDC25A and involved in the differentiation process
downstream of FLT3-ITD. In consequence, we cannot
exclude that CDK2, and/or CDK4/CDK6 are important
actors of this process. This hypothesis would be in line
with the very recent identification of CDK6 as a critical
effector of MLL fusions in leukemogenesis, underscoring
that cell cycle regulators may have distinct, non-canonical,
and non-redundant functions in different contexts [34].
By acting on different CDK/cyclin complexes, CDC25
inhibitors would constitute interesting candidates to
increase the therapeutic tools in the AML personalized
treatment, and intense research is ongoing to give rise
to new potent compounds [35, 36]. Since a few works
reported the possible importance of CDC25C [37] and
CDC25B [38] in AML, CDC25 family members inhibition
in these pathologies may be of interest in the future [39].
From a more general point of view, the ability
of cells to escape terminal differentiation is one of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

characteristics of cancer [40], and AML represents a
paradigm for this phenomenon [41]. Reinducing leukemic
cells differentiation constitutes an important alternative to
genotoxic therapeutic agents currently used to treat these
pathologies, but up to now, this approach is only routinely
used in the case of promyelocytic leukemia with alltransretinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, which transformed
the prognosis of this disease. In the non-promyelocytic
leukemia, the discovery of key mutations this last decade
led to intense efforts to improve therapeutic strategies
[42–44]. In parallel, in AML characterized by mutation
of the IDH2 gene, preliminary results of a phase I trial
of the IDH2 inhibitor AG-221 showed encouraging
rates of response, and nice differentiation of treated
leukemic cells in vitro and clinically with cases of
differentiation syndrome [45]. FLT3 inhibition is one
of the major promising targeted therapies in this subset.
Previous studies performed with transgenic mice models
expressing FLT3-ITD suggested that the expression
of this receptor induced myeloproliferative neoplasms
rather than AML, suggesting that FLT3-ITD expression
by itself did not significantly affect the hematopoietic
differentiation process in vivo [46]. Our data, as well
as those describing the implication of the ERK and of
CDK1 in this differentiation, suggest that implication of
FLT3-ITD signaling in myeloid differentiation has been
underestimated. To date, one of the most potent and
clinically advanced FLT3 inhibitor is AC220 (quizartinib)
(7, 10–12), and relief of differentiation block in vitro and
clinically [13] is one of the interesting mechanism of
action described for this drug. This pro-differentiation
effect of FLT3 inhibition seems to be an on-target effect,
as the in vitro results were obtained with other FLT3
inhibitors (sorafenib, lestaurtinib and tandutinib) [13–
15]. The fact that cases of resistance to quizartinib and
other FLT3 inhibitors are unavoidably described further
underlines the need to identify downstream targets. To
this respect, understanding of signaling and cell cycle
molecules impacting hematopoietic differentiation
downstream of FLT3-ITD will probably give some keys
for future treatments of this AML subtype.

Patient samples

Lentiviral infections

Patient AML samples used for experiments in
Figures 4 and 6 were obtained after informed consent in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and stored at
the HIMIP collection. According to the French law, HIMIP
collection has been declared to the Ministry of Higher
Education and Research (DC 2008-307 collection  1)
and obtained a transfer agreement (AC 2008-129) after
approbation by ethical committees (Comité de Protection
des Personnes Sud-Ouest et Outremer II and APHP ethical
committee). Clinical and biological annotations of the
samples have been declared to the CNIL (Comité National
Informatique et Libertés i.e. Data processing and Liberties
National Committee). Frozen cells were thawed in IMDM
medium with 20% FBS and immediately processed for
treatment. All patients were diagnosed at the Department
of Hematology of Toulouse University Hospital. Their
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Lentiviral shRNA particules were generated
as previously described [49]. Briefly, we used HEK293-T packaging cells, co-transfected with lentiviral
protein (GAG, POL, and ENV) encoding plasmids, and
MISSION® shRNA lentiviral plasmids (pLKO.1-puro:
non-targeting shRNA control vector and shCDC25A
vector:
TRCN10704NM_001789.x-529s1c1TRC1
(Sigma), separately). Supernatants containing lentivirus
were collected 48 h after transfection, during 3 consecutive
days. MOLM-14 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/mL in
serum-free medium and 20 μl of lentiviral supernatant
was added during 6 h. Cells were then grown in 10% FBS
RPMI medium.

siRNA
The MV4-11 cell line was transfected with the
Amaxa nucleofection technology (Lonza, Koeln,
Germany). Cells (2 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μL
of Amaxa solution L. 300 nM of specific STAT5A and
STAT5B siRNA (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, human
STAT5A and STAT5B, Dharmacon) or total CDC25A
siRNA (Hs_CDC25A_9, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
or 3′UTR CDC25A siRNA (CDC25A 2943, Sigma) or

added, and cells were transfected with the nucleofector
device (program Q-001; solution V and program O-017 for
MOLM-14; solution R and program V-001 for KG1). Cells
were subsequently resuspended in normal culture medium
at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/mL. Twenty-four or
forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were counted
(trypan blue staining), and western blotting was performed.

Western blot
2 × 106 cells were usually lysed in 100 μL of
NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (Novex, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), sonicated for 15 seconds, and boiled
for 3 minutes. Proteins were then resolved on NuPAGE®
4–12% Bis-Tris Gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane. Saturation of the membrane was done for
1 hour in Tris Buffer Saline with Tween 0.1% (TBS-T)
containing 5% non-fat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin.
Membranes were blotted with proper antibodies overnight
at 4°C, washed thrice with TBS-T, and incubated for
30 minutes with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody

Co-cultures
Patient samples, containing at least 80% of
blasts, were co-cultured with human stromal cells
