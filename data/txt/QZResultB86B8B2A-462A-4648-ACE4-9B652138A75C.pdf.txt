The Role of Targeted Agents in Preoperative
Chemoradiation for Rectal Cancer
Raymond C. Wadlow, MD and David P. Ryan, MD

In the United States, randomized trials have established preoperative chemoradiation as the standard of care for
patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates occur in 10% to 16% of
patients and have been shown to be correlated with both disease-free and overall survival. Therefore, recent efforts
incorporating newer cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents into chemoradiotherapy regimens have reported the
pCR rate to be a surrogate marker of clinical outcomes. Substitution of oral fluoropyrimidines, including capecitabine,
for infusional 5-fluorouracil reportedly generated pCR rates of up to 32% in phase 2 studies, but definitive evaluation
awaits results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-04 trial. Similarly, regimens
incorporating irinotecan generated pCR rates as high as 38%, but to the authors’ knowledge have not been evaluated
in randomized trials. In contrast, 2 large randomized trials reported that the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation led to an increase in grade 3/4 toxicity but no difference in pCR rates. Early phase
trials evaluating the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation reported modest pCR rates of 5% to 12%, and efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers of response
including EGFR copy number, k-ras mutational status, and both serum and tumor-specific expression of EGFR
ligands. Finally, incorporation of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab into chemoradiation appears to be safe and feasible, with initial studies reporting a beneficial effect on vascular normalization and
correlations between circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis and pathologic response. Future efforts should include
prospective studies of these agents in biomarker-defined subpopulations, as well as studies of novel agents that target angiogenesis, tumor-stromal interaction, and the cell signaling pathways implicated in colorectal cancer. Cancer

In 2008, an estimated 148,810 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the United States, including 40,740 with

rectal cancer.1 The rectum extends from the peritoneal reflection to the transitional mucosa of the anal dentate line. As
with colon cancer, surgery is the mainstay of curative therapy for patients with rectal cancer confined to the bowel and regional lymph nodes. However, in contrast to low rates of local failure after complete resection of colon cancer, local recurrences occurred in approximately 25% to 50% of patients with T3 or lymph node-positive rectal cancer before the era of
total mesorectal excision (TME).2 Recurrent pelvic disease is associated with significant morbidity and substantially lower
rates of curative resection.3 Therefore, the Gastrointestinal Study Group (GITSG), North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG), and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) cooperative groups conducted
randomized clinical trials in the 1980s and 1990s that demonstrated improved local control and survival with postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.4-6 Contemporaneously, the surgical community demonstrated that TME decreased
local failure rates to <10% by reducing the incidence of positive circumferential margins, calling into question the added
value of additional radiotherapy.7 Nonetheless, the benefit of radiotherapy combined with TME and postoperative chemotherapy was demonstrated by the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group trial.8 Subsequently, the landmark trial conducted by
the German Rectal Cancer Study Group established superior local control, reduced toxicity, and an improved rate of
sphincter preservation with neoadjuvant compared with adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation.9 By the
early part of this decade, preoperative radiotherapy with concurrent infusional 5-FU followed by TME had become the
standard of care in the United States for patients with T3 or lymph node-positive rectal cancer.

Review Article

Efforts to incorporate novel agents into chemoradiation for the treatment of patients with locally advanced
rectal cancer have used the pathologic complete response
(pCR) rate as a surrogate marker for clinical outcomes.
This strategy is based on data demonstrating a correlation
between rates of pCR and endpoints including distant
metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival
(DFS), and overall survival (OS).10-12 For example,
approximately 10% of patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemoradiation in the German Rectal Cancer Study
Group achieved a pCR as determined by Dworak tumor
regression grading (TRG).12 The 5-year DFS in this
group (TRG 4) was 86%, compared with 75% in patients
with TRG 2 and TRG 3 disease and 63% in patients with
TRG 0 to 1 disease (P ¼ .006 for TRG 4 disease). The 5year rates of DMFS were 86%, 75%, and 66%, respectively (P ¼ .009 for TRG 4 disease). It is interesting to
note that, although pathologic downstaging was associated with improved local control as well as DFS and
DMFS, there was no correlation noted between pCR and
rates of pelvic disease recurrence (0%, 4%, and 6%,
respectively, for TRG 4, TRG 2 to 3, and TRG 0 to 1 disease; P ¼ .33). These data suggest that pCR may be useful
predominantly as a surrogate marker for the eradication
of systemic micrometastases, and strategies that incorporate novel agents with systemic activity into preoperative
chemoradiation are likely to be the most successful. However, data from a randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant
chemoradiation with ‘‘short course’’ radiotherapy (5  5
gray [Gy]) demonstrated no difference in DFS or OS at 4
years despite a substantially higher pCR rate (16.1% vs
0.7%).13 Thus, the value of pCR as a predictor of longterm outcomes remains controversial. Nonetheless, recent
studies have focused on using novel agents in preoperative
chemoradiation to increase rates of pCR. This review will
address these studies in detail.
Oral Fluoropyrimidines
Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrmidine prodrug that is
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and then converted to 5-FU in 3 sequential enzymatic reactions, with
the last step catalyzed by thymidine phosphorylase. Theoretically, this process mimics the administration of intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) 5-FU without the
inconvenience of intravenous therapy. Furthermore, capecitabine may be associated with a higher therapeutic index
than IVCI 5-FU because of elevated levels of thymidine
phosphorylase within many types of cancer cells.14 Clinical trials in colon cancer comparing capecitabine with the

3538

combination of bolus 5-FU and leucovorin have demonstrated equivalent efficacy and reduced toxicity in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.15,16 In addition, radiation
up-regulates xenograft expression of thymidine phosphorylase, leading to a synergistic effect with concurrent capecitabine.17 Thus, the incorporation of capecitabine into
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer is an active area of research. Multiple phase 2
trials have demonstrated pCR rates ranging from 7% to
31% and generally acceptable levels of toxicity.18-21 A
matched pair analysis compared 89 patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer who were treated with capecitabinebased chemoradiation with 89 historical controls who
were treated with IVCI 5-FU.22 Rates of local control,
distant control, and OS were comparable at 3 years, as
were rates of tumor downstaging and pCR (21% with
capecitabine and 12% with IVCI 5-FU; P ¼ .19). Handfoot syndrome was more common in the capecitabinetreated group and mucositis was more common in the
group treated with IVCI 5-FU; grade 3 to 4 toxicities
occurred in 6% of both groups.22 Despite the short follow-up for capecitabine-treated patients and the use of
historical controls, the authors concluded that capecitabine is an acceptable alternative to IVCI 5-FU in combination with preoperative radiotherapy for patients with
nonmetastatic rectal cancer.22
Preliminary data from a randomized phase 3 trial
comparing capecitabine with 5-FU-based chemoradiation
revealed a reduced incidence of leukopenia, a greater incidence of hand-foot syndrome, and comparable gastrointestinal toxicity in patients treated with capecitabine.23 In
addition, there were trends toward greater rates of tumor
and lymph node pathological downstaging with capecitabine. However, definitive comparison of capecitabine
with IVCI 5-FU-based chemoradiation awaits the results
of the NSABP R-04 trial, in which patients are randomized to capecitabine or IVCI 5-FU-based chemoradiation
with or without oxaliplatin. Other oral fluoropyrimidines,
including tegafur-uracil (UFT) and S-1, have also generated promising clinical data, with pCR rates ranging from
9% to 32%.24-26 Together, these trials suggest that IVCI
5-FU may soon be supplanted by oral fluoropyrimidines
in preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.
Oxaliplatin
Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum drug that
blocks DNA replication and transcription by forming
adducts that cross-link the DNA double helix. When
administered in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin,

oxaliplatin significantly prolongs OS in patients with metastatic or resected stage III colon cancer.27,28 Oxaliplatin
has also been shown to have radiosensitizing properties,29
and phase 2 studies combining this agent with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation have reported pCR rates
ranging from 14% to 30%.30-34 For example, the Cancer
and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a phase 1/2
study of weekly oxaliplatin in conjunction with IVCI 5FU–based chemoradiation in 44 patients with clinically
staged T3/4 rectal cancer.33 The phase 1 portion identified a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of 60 mg/m2 per
week. Among 32 patients treated at the MTD, the pCR
rate was 25%, which compares favorably with the 10%
pCR rate observed in the German Rectal Cancer Study
Group. However, despite a 5-FU dose of only 200 mg/m2
per day, grade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in 38% of patients,
and only 56% of patients treated at the MTD completed
all 6 planned cycles of oxaliplatin.
In May 2009, 2 large randomized trials investigating
the role of oxaliplatin in preoperative chemoradiotherapy
were reported in abstract form at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology annual meeting.35,36 In the Italian Studio Terapia Adjuvante Retto (STAR-01) trial, 747
patients with clinical T3/ 4 or lymph node-positive resectable rectal cancer were randomized to receive neoadjuvant
5-FU–based chemoradiation (5040 centigrays [cGy] with
IVCI 5-FU at a dose of 225 mg/m2 daily) with or without
oxaliplatin (at a dose of 60 mg/m2 weekly). Greater than
90% of the planned radiotherapy was administered to
96% of patients treated with 5-FU alone and to 90% of
patients treated with oxaliplatin. TME was performed 6
to 8 weeks after chemoradiation in 94% and 93% of
patients, respectively. It is interesting to note that oxaliplatin significantly increased rates of any grade 3 or 4 toxicity
from 8% to 24% (P < .001), with no improvement noted
in pCR (16% vs 15%) or sphincter preservation (abdominoperineal resection required in 18% vs 19% of patients).
In the ACCORD 12/0405 PRODIGE 1 trial, 598
patients with T3 or resectable T4N0/1/2 rectal cancer
were randomized to receive preoperative radiotherapy (45
Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine (at a
dose of 800 mg/m2 twice daily administered 5 of every 7
days) or to a higher dose of radiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with the same dose of capecitabine
and oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2 weekly). TME was performed
in 98% of both groups 6 weeks after chemoradiation was
completed. As in the STAR-01 trial, the rate of grade 3 or
4 toxicity was found to be significantly higher in the oxaliplatin-treated group (25% vs 11%; P < .001), and there
Cancer

was no difference noted with regard to the rate of sphincter-sparing surgery (75% vs 78%). Although there was a
higher rate of pCR in the patients treated with oxaliplatin
(18.8% vs 13.8%), the difference did not reach statistical
significance (P ¼ .11). Moreover, it is possible that the
increased dose of radiation in the oxaliplatin treatment
arm may have contributed to the higher pCR rate as well
as greater toxicity. Therefore, these trials cast significant
doubt on the role of oxaliplatin in neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
Nonetheless, as discussed earlier, the use of pCR to predict long-term outcomes remains controversial. Furthermore, preoperative oxaliplatin may enhance DMFS.35
Therefore, the potential benefit of incorporating oxaliplatin into preoperative therapy for rectal cancer remains an
open question that awaits long-term results from both of
these studies as well as the NSABP R-04 trial.
Irinotecan
Irinotecan is a camptothecin derivative that inhibits topoisomerase I and has radiosensitizing properties.37 Large
randomized trials have demonstrated its activity against
metastatic colorectal cancer as a single agent or in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin.38-40 Multiple phase 1
and 2 studies have investigated combinations of irinotecan
with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation, with pCR
rates ranging from 0% to 38%.24,26,41-43 In what to our
knowledge is the largest of these studies, Navarro et al
reported results from a phase 2 trial in which 74 patients
with resectable T3/4 rectal cancer were treated with
50 mg/m2 of irinotecan weekly in combination with 5FU–based chemoradiotherapy (225 mg/m2 administered
5 days perweek).43 The median relative dose intensity for
both drugs was 100% of protocol-planned doses. The
pCR rate was 14% and toxicity was manageable, with
lymphopenia (47%) and diarrhea (14%) representing the
most common grade 3/4 toxicities.
In what to our knowledge is the only randomized
trial of irinotecan-containing chemoradiation performed
to date, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) Trial 0012 assigned 106 patients with clinical
T3/ 4 rectal cancers to treatment with hyperfractionated
radiotherapy with IVCI 5-FU or to standard fractionation
with IVCI 5-FU and 50 mg/m2 per week of irinotecan.44
The pCR rate was 28% in both treatment arms, suggesting no additional benefit with the addition of irinotecan.
Grade 3/4 hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities
occurred in 12% and 45% of patients, respectively,
randomized to the irinotecan arm versus 13% and 38% of

3539

Review Article

patients, respectively, randomized to the hyperfractionated radiotherapy arm. Thus, the benefit of adding irinotecan to fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation remains
uncertain, and phase 3 trials are not likely given the lack
of benefit reported in the adjuvant setting.45
Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor-Targeted Therapy
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) is a
member of the type I subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes ERBB2/ human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), ERBB3, and ERBB4.
These receptors are comprised of an extracellular ligandbinding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracytoplasmic domain with tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand
binding to the extracellular domain leads to receptor heterodimerization or homodimerization and autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the
cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylated residues then serve
as docking sites for a variety of cytoplasmic proteins that
relay growth and survival signals to the nucleus. Downstream signaling pathways include the ras-raf-mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. EGFR is
expressed in 60% to 80% of colorectal cancers and is correlated with poor survival.46 Preclinical models demonstrated that abrogation of EGFR signaling impaired cell
proliferation in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo, suggesting the potential utility of EGFR-targeted therapy in
patients with colorectal cancer.47
Two classes of drugs have been developed to target
EGFR. Cetuximab and panitumumab are monoclonal
antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR
and inhibit ligand-mediated activation of downstream
signaling cascades. Gefitinib and erlotinib are small molecules that competitively inhibit ATP binding to the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, thereby preventing
phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins. In a
randomized trial of 329 patients whose disease had progressed while receiving irinotecan-containing chemotherapy, the combination of irinotecan and cetuximab was
associated with a response rate of 22.9%, a median time
to disease progression of 4.1 months, and an OS of
8.6 months.48 These results were significantly better than
those generated in the comparison arm treated with cetuximab monotherapy. In addition, patients treated with
cetuximab alone were shown to have improved survival
and quality of life compared with those treated with best
supportive care.49 As a result of these data, cetuximab was

3540

approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in combination with irinotecan or as monotherapy
for patients unable to tolerate irinotecan for the treatment
of EGFR-expressing colorectal cancer that is resistant to
irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Similarly, panitumumab
was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer who have developed disease progression
while receiving oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan-containing
chemotherapy regimens.50 In contrast, neither gefitinib
nor erlotinib have demonstrated single-agent activity in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,51 and to our
knowledge there are no randomized trials in which these
agents have been combined with standard chemotherapy.
EGFR is also a rational target in combination with
radiotherapy. Data from a variety of experimental model
systems and human tumors suggest that EGFR signaling
promotes resistance to radiotherapy. For example, tumor
expression of EGFR in murine models of adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell carcinoma is reportedly inversely correlated with radiosensitivity.52 Stable transfection of EGFR
promotes resistance to radiotherapy in vitro in part by
activating cell survival signals through akt.53 Moreover,
retrospective analyses demonstrated shorter DFS and
smaller pCR rates in patients with rectal tumors expressing EGFR who were being treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy.54,55 Taken together, these data suggest the
possibility of enhancing radiosensitivity with EGFRdirected therapy.
Gefitinib

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that gefitinib
enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.56 Thus, investigators from Duke University
treated 16 patients with stage II to IV rectal cancer or
locally advanced pancreatic cancer with 250 mg/day of
gefitinib and 1 of 2 dose levels of capecitabine in combination with 5040 cGy of radiotherapy administered in 28
fractions.57 Dose-limiting toxicity comprised predominantly of diarrhea was observed in 8 patients, and there
were no pCRs noted. The authors concluded that the
combination of gefitinib with capecitabine and radiotherapy resulted in excess toxicity, and no phase 2 dose could
be recommended. In contrast, Valentini et al reported a
pCR rate of 30% in a study of 41 patients with clinical
T3/4 or lymph node-positive rectal cancer who were
treated with IVCI 5-FU and gefitinib in combination
with pelvic radiotherapy.58 However, dose reduction was
required in 61% of patients, with grade 3 toxicities

reported, including gastrointestinal (21%), hepatic
(26%), skin (15%), and genitourinary (10%) toxicities.
Therefore, further studies are required to establish the feasibility and safety of gefitinib in combination with
chemoradiotherapy.
Panitumumab

Phase 1 data indicate that panitumumab can be
administered safely in combination with chemoradiation
to patients with head and neck cancer, but to the best of
our knowledge, the drug has not been studied with radiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer.59
Cetuximab

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cetuximab sensitizes cells with endogenous or forced overexpression of EGFR to radiotherapy both in vitro and in vivo.60
In addition, a recently conducted randomized trial in
patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck demonstrated improved
locoregional control and OS in patients treated with
cetuximab and radiotherapy compared with those treated
with radiotherapy alone.61 Thus, the incorporation of
cetuximab into neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients
with locally advanced rectal cancer is an area of active
investigation.
To our knowledge, 6 phase 1/2 studies to date have
investigated combinations of chemoradiation and cetuximab. Chung et al treated 20 patients with ultrasoundstaged (u)T3 to 4, clinical T4, or locally recurrent rectal
cancer with weekly cetuximab (at a dose of 400 mg/m2 on
Day 1 and 250 mg/m2 thereafter) and IVCI 5-FU (at a
dose of 225 mg/m2) during 5.5 weeks of pelvic radiotherapy (50.40 Gy), followed by an additional 4 weeks of
cetuximab.62 Patients underwent surgical resection 1 to 3
weeks after the completion of therapy. Eighteen patients
completed therapy and 17 underwent surgery; the pCR
rate was 12%. The authors concluded that cetuximab in
conjunction with IVCI 5-FU and pelvic radiotherapy was
feasible without synergistic or unexpected toxicities, warranting further investigation. German investigators
treated 20 patients with uT2 to 4 or lymph node-positive
rectal cancer with the same schedule of weekly cetuximab
and escalating doses of capecitabine and irinotecan
according to a phase 1 design.63 Treatment was administered concurrently with pelvic radiotherapy, and surgery
was performed 4 to 5 weeks after the completion of therapy. The authors identified 40 mg/m2 of weekly irinotecan and 500 mg/m2 of twice-daily capecitabine as the

Cancer

recommended dose levels for further study. Nineteen
patients underwent surgery, and a pCR was identified in 4
of 5 patients with uT2 tumors but in only 1 of 14 patients
with uT3 tumors. In a follow-up phase 2 study of this
treatment schedule, only 4 of 50 patients achieved a pCR
(8%).64 In another phase 1 of 2 trial from Germany, 60
patients with uT3 to 4 or lymph node-positive rectal cancer were treated with the same schedule of cetuximab,
50 mg/m2 of weekly oxaliplatin, and capecitabine during
Weeks 1 to 2 and 4 to 5 of radiotherapy according to a
phase 1 dose-escalation design.65 The MTD of capecitabine was not reached, and 48 patients were treated with
825 mg/m2 twice daily. Grade 3/4 diarrhea occurred in
19% of patients, and 94% underwent surgery. The pCR
rate was 9%. Italian investigators treated 40 patients with
uT3/4 or lymph node-positive rectal cancer with 3 doses
of weekly cetuximab followed by pelvic radiotherapy in
combination with IVCI 5-FU and weekly cetuximab.66
Thirty-five patients (88%) completed treatment, and 5
patients withdrew early because of grade 3 of 4 hypersensitivity reactions (3 patients), early development of liver
metastases (1 patient), and purulent arthritis possibly
related to drug administration (1 patient). The most common grade 1 of 2 toxicities were skin rash (70%), diarrhea
(32%), and hypersensitivity reactions (13%). These were
also the most common grade 3/4 toxicities (7.5% for all
3). Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical resection
with a pCR rate of 8%. Finally, in a trial from Belgium,
40 patients with uT3 to 4 or lymph node-positive rectal
cancer were treated with 400 mg/m2 of cetuximab 1 week
before the beginning of pelvic radiotherapy followed by
250 mg/m2 weekly for 5 weeks in addition to capecitabine
at 1 of 2 dose levels.67 Thirty-six patients were treated at
the second dose level (825 mg/m2 twice daily). Grade 1/2
toxicities included acneiform rash (87%), diarrhea (65%),
and fatigue (57%). Grade 3 diarrhea and all grade 4 toxicity occurred in 15% and 7.5% of patients, respectively.
The pCR rate was 5%. Together, the results of these studies demonstrated that cetuximab could be administered
safely in combination with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. However, pCR rates have been disappointingly low, perhaps
because anti-EGFR therapy is most effective in inhibiting
the accelerated repopulation observed after the higher
doses of radiotherapy used in patients with head and neck
cancer.68 Alternatively, cetuximab-induced inhibition of
mitogenic signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway may mitigate the radiosensitizing effect of S phase-specific chemotherapy.

Review Article

Recent efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers predictive of response to cetuximab. In the metastatic setting, responses are not predicated on detection of
EGFR by immunohistochemistry.69 However, multiple
analyses have demonstrated that responses to either cetuximab or panitumumab occur exclusively within the 60%
to 70% of patients without activating mutations in codon
12 of k-ras.70-73 The activating V600E b-raf mutation is
present in an additional 10% of patients, and it too
appears to be predictive of a lack of response to antiEGFR therapy.74 In the Italian study discussed earlier,
EGFR copy number was found to be significantly correlated with tumor regression.75 Although there was a trend
toward a greater rate of tumor regression among patients
with wild-type k-ras, it did not reach statistical significance (36.7% k-ras wild-type vs 11% k-ras mutant; P ¼
.12). In a subsequent article from the Belgian group,
Debucquoy et al reported data from extensive molecular
analyses of tumor and plasma samples taken before and after the initial loading dose of cetuximab.76 Tumor biopsies were stained for EGFR and Ki-67. Median Ki-67
staining decreased from 85% to 67%, and down-regulation was associated with pathologic response to chemoradiotherapy. EGFR staining was up-regulated in 55% of
cases, down-regulated in 30%, and unchanged in 15%.
Although there was no correlation with pathologic
response noted, up-regulation of EGFR in the tumor was
associated with improved DFS (P ¼ .02). This finding
contrasted with the results of previous studies,54,77,78 and
the authors speculated that up-regulated EGFR may constitute a salvage response, resulting in a more available receptor as a target for cetuximab. In addition, proteomic
analysis of blood samples before and after therapy with
cetuximab revealed increased concentrations of the EGFR
ligands transforming growth factor-a (TGF-a) and
amphiregulin (P < .05), and increased TGF-a remained
significant after multivariate analysis. Furthermore,
increased concentrations of TGF-a were validated by
enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay in 73% of
patients and was predictive of tumor downstaging (P ¼
.05). These data are consistent with previous findings that
up-regulated tumor expression of EGFR ligands was correlated with DFS in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer who were treated with cetuximab.79 Finally, as in
the Italian study, the authors found no correlation
between wild-type k-ras (present in 69%) and pathologic
response to therapy.
Microarray-based expression profiling of pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies revealed that the expres-

3542

sion of 16 genes was significantly altered (P < .0005) by
cetuximab, including 3 down-regulated genes implicated
in tumor invasion (SERPINE2, TNS4, and S100A6). In
addition, supervised analysis of the microarray data
revealed an association between elevated pretreatment
expression of extracellular matrix proteins and disease recurrence. Therefore, these data suggest that a dense
stroma may safeguard malignant cells from the cytotoxic
effects of chemoradiation despite cetuximab-induced
down-regulation of proinvasive pathways. In contrast,
gene enrichment analysis suggested a correlation between
DFS and up-regulated expression of inflammation-related
genes. Moreover, DFS also was found to be correlated
with the presence of fibroinflammatory stroma in the
resected specimen. Furthermore, proteomic analysis
revealed up-regulated concentrations of 6 inflammationrelated proteins. In concordance with a previous analysis
of rectal tumors after chemoradiation, these results suggest
that stromal and possibly systemic inflammation in
response to cetuximab and chemoradiotherapy may predict prolonged DFS.80 Nonetheless, these data should be
interpreted as hypothesis-generating and requiring further
investigation in prospective trials. Given the low pCR
rates reported in each of these studies, the identification of
biomarkers for response to cetuximab-containing chemoradiotherapy remains an important area of research.
Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor-Targeted Therapy
Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and malignant
progression, and the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) is a crucial regulator of this process. The negative
effect of VEGF blockade on tumor growth has been established by experiments using both xenograft and transgenic
mouse models of cancer.81,82 Moreover, elevated VEGF
expression in tumors has been associated with inferior survival.83 Therefore, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab
was developed and demonstrated promising activity in a
randomized phase 2 trial of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.84 In a subsequent phase 3 trial, 813 patients
with previously untreated colorectal cancer were randomized to treatment with irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and leucovorin (IFL) plus placebo or to IFL plus bevacizumab.85
The median OS was 20.3 months in the patients treated
with bevacizumab, compared with 15.6 months in those
treated with the placebo-containing regimen (P < .001)
and response rates were 44.8% and 34.8%, respectively (P
¼ .004). Toxicities attributable to bevacizumab included
grade 3 hypertension (11%) and gastrointestinal

perforation (1.5%). Although phase 1 and 2 studies identified hemorrhage, thromboembolism, and proteinuria as
additional toxicities associated with bevacizumab,84,86
these were not found to be increased compared with placebo in the phase 3 study. As a result of this study, bevacizumab was approved by the FDA for the first-line
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in combination
with any approved 5-FU-containing regimen. A subsequent trial confirmed the role of adding bevacizumab to
infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX),
although the benefit was limited to progression-free
survival.87
Several lines of evidence suggest that VEGF inhibition may also be effective in the context of chemoradiation administered to patients with locally advanced rectal
cancer. For example, elevated VEGF expression in lymph
node-positive rectal tumors was associated with shorter
event-free survival and an increased risk of distant metastasis after surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation.88 In addition, anti-VEGF antibody enhanced the
capacity of radiotherapy to reduce tumor vascular density
and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in xenografts.89 These
findings provided support for the vascular normalization
hypothesis.90 According to this hypothesis, an excess of
proangiogenic factors within tumors leads to functionally
and structurally abnormal vasculature that promotes
increased IFP and impaired delivery of oxygen and macromolecules. By ‘‘pruning’’ this abnormal vasculature, transient antiangiogenic therapy reduces IFP, thereby
facilitating both drug penetration and the tissue oxygenation required for effective radiotherapy.
To assess the role of bevacizumab integrated into a
program of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients
with clinically staged T3/4 rectal cancer, Willett et al
treated 32 patients with 4 cycles of bevacizumab administered every 14 days.91 After a loading dose of bevacizumab, chemoradiotherapy with IVCI 5-FU (at a dose of
225 mg/m2 per day) was given during Cycles 2 to 4, followed by surgery performed 7 to 10 weeks after the completion of therapy. Pelvic radiotherapy was comprised of
5040 cGy given in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks. In the
phase 1 portion of the study, 2 of 5 patients treated with
10 mg/kg of bevacizumab developed dose-limiting toxicities of diarrhea and colitis. Thus, the phase 2 dose was 5
mg/kg. Although approximately 40% of patients developed postoperative complications, it is unclear whether
bevacizumab was a contributing factor. Among all 32
patients, the pCR rate was 16%, and actuarial 5-year local
control and OS rates were 100%. The actuarial 5-year

Cancer

DFS rate was 75%, and 5 patients developed metastatic
disease after surgery. Approximately 40% of patients
developed postoperative complications, including 1 anastomotic leak, 2 incidents of delayed perineal wound healing, and 3 wound infections.
Similarly, Crane et al treated 25 patients with
T3N0/1 rectal cancer with 50.4 Gy of radiotherapy over
5.5 weeks, capecitabine (at a dose of 900 mg/m2 administered twice daily on days of radiotherapy), and bevacizumab (at a dose of 5 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks)
followed approximately 7 weeks later by TME.68 The
pCR rate was 32%. Eight patients developed perioperative wound complications, including 3 (12%) requiring
surgical intervention and 4 of 6 patients with perineal
wound complications after abdominoperineal resection.
Although the contribution of bevacizumab to wound
complications in these studies remains uncertain, the possibility merits close monitoring in future trials.
Willett et al performed sigmoidoscopies and tumor
IFP measurements before and 12 days after the loading
dose of bevacizumab, demonstrating a significant reduction in IFP at 12 days (P ¼ .0034).91 Patients underwent
functional imaging with dynamic computed tomography
(CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans
before and 12 days after the loading dose of bevacizumab,
and again 1 week before surgery. Dynamic CT studies
revealed a significant decrement in blood flow and permeability surface area product after bevacizumab alone, as
well as a significant reduction in all measured vascular parameters after combined modality treatment. PET scans
indicated no difference in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake after
bevacizumab monotherapy, but a significant decrease after combination therapy. The authors concluded that bevacizumab alone or with chemoradiotherapy decreased
vascular permeability and induced vascular pruning, suggesting an improvement in tumor vessel function. It is
interesting to note that there was no correlation noted
between IFP or functional imaging measurements and the
extent of tumor regression at surgery.
In the same study, a variety of plasma and circulating cell biomarkers were measured before and during bevacizumab monotherapy, during combination therapy,
and before surgery. Both VEGF and placenta-derived
growth factor (PIGF) were found to be significantly elevated by bevacizumab alone and by combination therapy.
Increases in VEGF and PIGF have also been reported after
the administration of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors,92,93 leading
the authors to speculate that these molecules may be

3543

generic pharmacodynamic biomarkers for anti-VEGF
therapy. In an analysis of variables associated with pathologic response, the authors reported that pretreatment levels of soluble VEGFR1 were significantly correlated with
pathologic tumor staging after preoperative chemotherapy
or chemoradiation (ypT) classification and were higher in
patients with no T downstaging after combination therapy (P < .01). In addition, patients with >2-fold
increases in PIGF after bevacizumab monotherapy demonstrated minimal or no residual disease at surgery (P <
.05), and fewer circulating endothelial cells before surgery
was found to be correlated with pCR (P < .05). Associations between elevated circulating endothelial cells and
poor clinical outcomes have also been reported in patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma who
were treated with the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
sunitinib and cediranib, respectively.92,94 Each of these
candidate biomarkers, both functional and molecular,
requires validation in larger trials. Nonetheless, these data
constitute an important step forward in understanding
the effects and potential benefit of anti-VEGF therapy in
patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

Combined Anti-EGFR and Anti-VEGF Therapy
Preclinical data suggested a synergistic antitumor effect
with combined EGFR and VEGF blockade.95 Thus, the
negative results from 2 phase 3 randomized trials investigating this strategy in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer were unexpected. In the Panitumumab Advanced
Colorectal Cancer Evaluation (PACCE) study, 823
patients were treated with oxaliplatin, 5-FU, leucovorin,
and bevacizumab with or without panitumumab.96 The
median progression-free survival was found to be significantly worse in the patients treated with panitumumab
(10 months vs 11.4 months) and grade 3/4 toxicities were
more frequent. An additional 230 patients treated with
irinotecan instead of oxaliplatin had increased toxicity
and no evidence of benefit when treated with both antibodies. In the CAIRO2 trial, 755 patients were treated
with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with or
without cetuximab.97 Once again, progression-free survival was found to be inferior with dual antibody therapy
(9.4 months vs 10.7 months) and grade 3/4 toxicities
were more common. In the PACCE study, the results
were independent of k-ras mutational status. In the
CAIRO2 study, patients with k-ras mutations fared worse
with both antibodies and those with wild-type k-ras
derived no benefit. Thus, combined therapy with bevaci-

3544

zumab and either cetuximab or panitumumab is currently
not indicated unless as part of a research protocol.
Despite these results, it remains premature to completely abandon further investigation of combined VEGF
and EGFR blockade in patients with colorectal cancer.
Although the administration of bevacizumab and an antiEGFR antibody appears to be detrimental for the majority
of patients with metastatic disease, select subgroups may
derive benefit. Biomarker discovery with the aim of identifying these subgroups is a subject of investigation in the
ongoing CALGB 80405 trial. Furthermore, the effect of
combined blockade in the context of preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer remains unknown. We recently
reported preliminary results from a phase 1/2 trial of bevacizumab and erlotinib in combination with IVCI 5-FU
(225 mg/m2/day) and pelvic radiotherapy (5040 cGy in
28 fractions) for patients with clinical T3/4 rectal cancer.98 Bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg was administered
on Days 1, 15, and 29. The first cohort received erlotinib
at a dose of 50 mg, the second cohort received it at a dose
of 100 mg, and third cohort received it at a dose of
150 mg daily until the completion of radiotherapy.
Patients underwent surgery 6 to 9 weeks after radiotherapy. The primary endpoints were determination of the
MTD and pCR. Secondary endpoints included toxicity,
local control, progression-free survival, and median survival. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Erlotinib
at a dose of 100 mg was chosen as the MTD. At the time
of last follow-up, 15 patients had completed study therapy
and underwent surgery, 7 of whom (47%) demonstrated
a pCR. At a median follow-up of 7 months, there were no
local recurrences reported in patients who completed
study therapy. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicities
included lymphopenia (59%), diarrhea (24%), rash
(12%), cardiac ischemia (6%), transaminitis (6%), and
mucositis (6%). One patient developed an anastomotic
leak. Thus, bevacizumab and erlotinib in combination
with IVCI 5-FU and pelvic radiotherapy appears to be a
well-tolerated and highly active preoperative regimen for
patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
Summary and Future Directions
Multiple phase 1 and 2 studies have suggested that the
addition of newer cytotoxic agents to preoperative fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation for patients with locally
advanced rectal cancer is a feasible strategy, perhaps
enhancing pathologic response rates and thereby improving long-term outcomes. However, recently reported
randomized trials of oxaliplatin demonstrated excess

toxicity with no benefit. Nonetheless, based on the adjuvant colon cancer trials, oxaliplatin will continue to be
used frequently in combination with 5-FU as postoperative chemotherapy despite a lack of efficacy data in
patients with rectal cancer. Future work is likely to focus
on preoperative chemotherapy before chemoradiation as a
strategy for improving pathologic downstaging while
simultaneously treating micrometastatic disease.99 Moreover, in patients with colon cancer, there are ongoing
efforts to identify and validate molecular biomarkers as a
means of patient selection for either oxaliplatin or irinotecan. For example, in a retrospective analysis of patients
with stage III colon cancer, there was a trend toward
improved DFS among those treated with adjuvant irinotecan and bolus 5-FU and leucovorin compared with
those treated with the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin alone in the subgroup with loss of DNA mismatch
repair protein expression and/or microsatellite instability.100 In addition, the ongoing Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 5202 trial of patients with stage II
colon cancer is prospectively addressing the role of microsatellite instability/mismatch repair protein deficiency
and loss of 18q in patient selection for oxaliplatin chemotherapy. These strategies also appear promising in preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.78,101
Similarly, incorporating anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF
therapies into preoperative chemoradiation for patients
with locally advanced rectal cancer does not appear to dramatically enhance pathologic downstaging, although to
our knowledge randomized trials have not yet been
reported. Nonetheless, these agents appear to have substantial radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing properties
in preclinical model systems, and early phase trials suggest
that they may contribute substantially to pathologic
response in biomarker-defined subpopulations. The
ongoing identification and validation of these biomarkers
remains an active area of research. In addition, despite the
recent experience in metastatic colorectal cancer, combined EGFR and VEGF blockade merits further investigation in the context of preoperative chemoradiation for
rectal cancer. Novel antiangiogenic agents including
VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and soluble VEGF
receptors as well as vascular disrupting agents have either
been approved for other solid tumor indications or have
entered clinical trials. These agents should be investigated
in rectal cancer. Moreover, a variety of molecularly targeted agents including b-raf inhibitors, MAP kinase pathway inhibitors, and PI3K inhibitors are entering clinical
development. Their potential radiosensitizing effects and

Cancer

activity against colorectal cancer are likely to be elucidated
in the coming years.
