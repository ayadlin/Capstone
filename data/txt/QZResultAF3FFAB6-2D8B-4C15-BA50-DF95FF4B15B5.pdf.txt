Abstract
Despite recent advances in the treatment of colon cancer, tumor resistance is a frequent cause of
chemotherapy failure. To better elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in resistance to irinotecan
(and its active metabolite SN38), we established SN38-resistant clones derived from HCT-116 and SW48 cell lines.
These clones show various levels (6- to 60-fold) of resistance to SN-38 and display enhanced levels of activated
MAPK p38 as compared with the corresponding parental cells. Because four different isoforms of p38 have been
described, we then studied the effect of p38 overexpression or downregulation of each isoform on cell sensivity to
SN38 and found that both a and b isoforms are involved in the development of resistance to SN38. In this line, we
show that cell treatment with SB202190, which inhibits p38a and p38b, enhanced the cytotoxic activity of SN38.
Moreover, p38 inhibition sensitized tumor cells derived from both SN38-sensitive and -resistant HCT116 cells to
irinotecan treatment in xenograft models. Finally, we detected less phosphorylated p38 in primary colon cancer
of patients sensitive to irinotecan-based treatment, compared with nonresponder patients. This indicates that
enhanced level of phosphorylated p38 could predict the absence of clinical response to irinotecan. Altogether,
our results show that the p38 MAPK pathway is involved in irinotecan sensitivity and suggest that phosphorylated p38 expression level could be used as a marker of clinical resistance to irinotecan. They further suggest that
targeting the p38 pathway may be a potential strategy to overcome resistance to irinotecan-based chemotherapies in colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1041–9. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent malignancy in Western countries. Despite significant developments
in CRC treatment, it still causes extensive mortality. Nowadays, the chemotherapy options for metastatic CRC patients
consist in the combination of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/
LV) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin
(FOLFOX) associated, or not, with the anti-VEGF antibody
Bevacizumab or the anti-EGFR antibody Cetuximab (1).
Cetuximab indication is restricted to patients with wild type
KRAS, as KRAS mutations predict resistance to treatment with

anti-EGRF monoclonal antibodies (2). Therapeutic failure is
mainly due to resistance to drug treatment. Thus, identifying
the cellular mechanisms that lead to resistance is a crucial
issue for improving CRC treatment and survival.
Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a derivative of camptothecin and its
active metabolite is SN-38. Like other camptothecin derivatives, SN38 inhibits topoisomerase I (TopoI), a nuclear enzyme
needed for replication and transcription by unwinding supercoiled DNA (3). SN38 interferes with TopoI activity by trapping
TopoI-DNA cleavage complexes, leading to lethal replicationmediated double strand breaks (3) that induce phosphorylation of the H2AX histone variant and activate the ATM-CHK2p53, DNA-PK, and ATR-CHK1 signaling pathways.
Cellular mechanisms causing irinotecan resistance have
been reported for each step of the CPT-11 pathway (4). Reduced
intracellular drug accumulation (5) and alterations in CPT-11
and SN38 metabolism play important role in the development
of resistance (6). In addition, quantitative and qualitative
alterations of TopoI have been extensively reported in cell
lines (7–10, 27). Finally, alterations in the cellular responses to
ternary complex formation that ultimately lead either to repair
of DNA damage or to cell death (11, 12) can induce resistance to
camptothecins. The clinical relevance of these resistance
mechanisms is poorly documented, except for the high variability in patients’ metabolism of CPT-11, which represents a
good response indicator. Moreover, there is a need to find new

markers that can predict patients’ response to irinotecanbased regimens and thus help to identify the patients who
are most likely to respond to such treatments. We have previously shown that SN38-resistant HCT116 cells display endogenous activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK; ref. 13). p38 belongs to a class of serine/threonine
MAPK (14) and is composed of 4 isoforms (a, b, g, and d) with
more than 60% overall sequence homology and more than 90%
identity within the kinase domains. p38a and p38b are
expressed in most tissues and are both sensitive to pyridinyl
imidazole inhibitors (such as SB202190), whereas p38g and
p38d have a more restricted pattern of expression and are
insensitive to these inhibitors (15). p38 is activated through
phosphorylation at the Thr180-Gly-Tyr182 motif by MKK3,
MKK4, and MKK6 (16). Phosphorylated p38 then activate a
wide range of substrates that include transcription factors,
protein kinases, and cytosolic and nuclear proteins, leading to
diverse responses such as inflammatory responses, cell differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, cytokine
production, and regulation of RNA splicing (15). The role of
p38 in cancer depends on the cell type and cancer stage: some
studies have reported that p38 increases cell proliferation,
whereas in others the activation of the MAPK p38 pathway
is described as a tumor suppressor. For example, p38a expression is downregulated in lung tumors, suggesting that p38 loss
could be related to tumor formation (17). Consistent with this,
the expression of MKK4, a p38 activator, is reduced in advanced
tumors (18). Conversely, increased levels of phosphorylated
p38a have been correlated with malignancy in follicular lymphoma, lung, thyroid, and breast carcinomas, glioma, and head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (19). In CRC, p38a is
required for cell proliferation and survival and its inhibition
leads to cell-cycle arrest and autophagic cell death (20).
Here, we have examined the functional role of the four p38
isoforms in the development of irinotecan resistance. We
show that p38 is activated by irinotecan treatment and that
all the tested SN38-resistant HCT116 cell lines display higher
p38 phosphorylation level than control or SN38-sensitive cells.
Pharmacologic inhibition of p38a and p38b overcome irinotecan resistance and, therefore, could be used to prevent the
development of a resistant phenotype in sensitive cells.
Finally, we report higher level of phosphorylated p38 in tumor
samples from patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based
therapy compared with responder patients.

Drug sensitivity assay
Cell growth inhibition and cell viability after SN38 treatment were assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as
previously described (5).

Western blot analyses
Western blot analysis of cell extracts from control and
retrovirus-infected cells were performed as previously
described (21). Primary antibodies were directed against
phospho-p38, p38a, p38b, p38g, p38d, pATF2 (Cell Signaling
Technology), b-actin (AbCam), and TopoI (1). Secondary
antibodies were horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit antisera (Sigma Aldrich).
Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips in culture
dishes. They were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, blocked in
PBS with 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton, and incubated with an
anti-phospho p38 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and then with a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum (maker). 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was
used to stain the nuclei. Coverslips were then mounted in
Moviol, and images were recorded using a 63 NA objective
and a Leica inverted microscope.
Retroviral infection
HCT116-s and HCT116-SN6 cells that stably express the 4
constitutively active (CA) p38 isoforms were obtained by
retroviral gene transduction of the pMSCV vector in which
CA variants of p38a, p38b, p38g, and p38d (22) had been
previously subcloned. Twenty-four hours after transduction,
cells were selected with 1 mg/mL of hygromycin and then
stable clones were pooled.
HCT116-s and HCT116-SN6 cells expressing short hairpin
RNA's (shRNA) targeting luciferase, p38a, p38b, p38g , and p38d
mRNA were obtained by retroviral gene transduction of the
pSIREN vector in which the shRNAs were cloned. Cells were
selected with 1 mg/mL of puromycin and then stable clones
were pooled.
Kinase assay
The p38 kinase assay was performed using the nonradioactive p38 MAPK Assay Kit from Cell Signaling Technology as
previously described (13).

control group received 0.2 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution according to the same schedule.
SB202190 stock solution was diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride and administered i.p. at 0.05 mmol/kg daily for 12 days
when tumors reached 100 mm3.
Irinotecan þ SB202190 were administered when tumors
reached 100 mm3: 4 injections (1 every 4 days) of irinotecan at
40 mg/kg þ SB202190 at 0.05 mmol/kg for 12 days.
Protein extraction from xenografts
Xenografts from nude mice were isolated and proteins
extracted as follows. Tumors were cut and lysed in 500 mL
of lysing buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 1
mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5% NP40, 1% Triton,
2 mmol/L PMSF, 100 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L Na3VO4, and
a cocktail of protease inhibitors) and then homogenized
with beads using the MixerMill apparatus. Extracts
were centrifuged and proteins in the supernatants were
quantified with the Bradford assay and loaded on SDSPAGE gels.
Detection of phosphorylated p38 by
immunohistochemistry in clinical samples
A tissue microarray (TMA) including samples from 21
metastatic CRC patients was constructed as previously
described (24), using 3 malignant tissue cores (0.6-mm diameter) per tumor. Tissue samples were from patients of a
previously published prospective series (25) and were all
chemotherapy-naive at the time of surgery of their primary
tumor. They all subsequently received the FOLFIRI regimen as
first-line chemotherapy. Tumor response was evaluated
according to the WHO recommendations after each of the
4 or 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Nine patients showed a
decrease of 50% or more of their metastatic lesion and were
classified as responders, and 12 patients, with a decrease of
less than 50% or with an increase in size of lesions, were
classified as nonresponders. Three-micrometer sections of the
TMA were deparaffinized and rehydrated in graded alcohols.
Following epitope retrieval treatment in EDTA buffer (pH 9)
and neutralization of endogenous peroxidase, TMA sections
were incubated overnight at 4 C with the anti-phospho-p38
MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182; Cell Signaling Technology), followed by
a standard detection system (FLEXþ; Dako). Phospho-p38
signals were observed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of
tumors cells, but only the nuclear staining was taken into
account. Briefly, each spot in the TMA sections received a
score for the percentage of marked cells and for the staining
intensity. Data were then consolidated into a single score as
the mean of the triplicate score. Finally, we defined a Quick
Score (QS) by multiplying the intensity grade by the percentage of stained nuclei.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as medians (range)
and compared between populations with the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Qualitative variables were compared
using the Fisher's exact test. Differences were considered
statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Survival rates were estimated from the date of the xenograft
to the date when the tumor reached a volume of 200 mm3,
using the Kaplan–Meier method. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 11.0 software (StatCorp).

Results
The MAPK p38 is constitutively activated in SN38resistant colon carcinoma cells and its phosphorylation
is increased by SN38 treatment
We have already shown that HCT116-SN6 colon adenocarcinoma cells, which display a 6-fold resistance to SN38, present constitutive activation of the MAPK p38, compared with a
sensitive clone HCT116-s (13). Now, we investigated whether
SN38 treatment favors p38 activation in sensitive HCT116-s
and SN38-resistant HCT116-SN6 cells. Western blot analysis
using phospho-specific p38 antibodies showed an increase of
p38 phosphorylation following SN38 treatment in both cell
lines (Fig. 1A). In untreated cells, basal p38 phosphorylation
was more pronounced in HCT116-SN6 than in HCT116-s cells,
as previously reported. We confirmed these results by immunofluorescence (IF; Fig. 1B). Phospho-p38 staining (in green)
appeared to be granular or punctuated as previously reported
(26). These results indicate that p38 is activated by SN38 in
both SN38-sensitive and -resistant HCT116 cells.
To determine whether p38 is constitutively activated only in
the SN38-resistant HCT116-SN6 clone, we tested the level of
p38 phosphorylation in 4 other resistant clones, HCT116-A2,
-SN50, -C8, and -G7 by immunofluorescence. We found that in
all SN38-resistant clones, basal p38 phosphorylation was
higher than in HCT116-s cells (Fig. 1C). To determine whether
this phenomenon could be observed in another colon cancer
cell model, we used the SW48-sensitive cells and generated
SN38-resistant clones (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similar to
HCT116 SN38-resistant clones, all SW48 resistant clones displayed higher p38 phosphorylation, as compared with the
parental SW48-s clone further suggesting that this feature
could be a hallmark of SN38 resistance.
The p38a and p38b isoforms are involved in SN38
resistance
We then analyzed the potential functional impact of p38
phosphorylation on the development of resistance to SN38. To
this aim, we expressed a CA form of the upstream p38
activating kinase MKK6 in HCT116 cells. CA MKK6 rendered
cells more resistant to SN38 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2),
confirming the notion that activation of p38 can induce SN38
resistance. Because p38 has 4 isoforms (a, b, g, and d), we then
overexpressed or downregulated each isoform in HCT116-s
and HCT116-SN6 cells to identify which one was involved in
the development of resistance to SN38.
First, each of the 4 p38 isoforms was downregulated by
shRNA in SN38-sensitive HCT116-s cells (Fig. 2A, left), and the
effect of their silencing on the sensitivity to SN38 was tested
with the SRB assay. SN38 cytotoxicity was stronger only in the
cells in which p38a was silenced (Fig. 2B, left), as shown by
their lower IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) than in control

cells (1.1 and 1.9 nmol/L, respectively, P ¼ 0.002). Silencing of
the b, g, or d isoform had no impact on SN38 sensitivity in
HCT116-s cells.
Then, HCT116-s cells were infected with retroviruses
expressing a CA variant of each p38 isoform (22) and sensitivity to SN38 was again tested using the SRB assay. Expression
of the CA p38 variants was monitored by Western blotting
with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2A, right). No difference in the
IC50 of the different cell lines was observed (Fig. 2C). We then
tested whether coexpression of the a and b isoforms could
affect HCT116-s cell sensitivity to SN38 and found that these
cells became more resistant to SN38 as evidenced by a higher
IC50 (Fig. 2D). This result indicates that overexpression of both
p38 isoforms a and b can influence sensitivity of HCT116-s
cells to SN38.
Silencing of the 4 p38 isoforms by shRNA and expression of
the CA isoforms were then carried out in SN38-resistant
HCT116-SN6 cells and were monitored by Western blotting
as before (Fig. 2E). For HCT116-s cells, only downregulation of
p38a sensitized HCT116-SN6 cells to SN38 treatment (Fig. 2F;
IC50: 3.6 and 10 nmol/L respectively, P ¼ 0.0003). In addition,
overexpression of CA p38b (Fig. 2G) or p38a þ b (Fig. 2H)
rendered HCT116-SN6 cells more resistant to SN38 treatment
(b overexpression; IC50: 19.4 and 10 nmol/L, respectively, P ¼
0.0018 and a þ b overexpression; IC50: 16.125 and 9 nmol/L, P
¼ 0.0028). These results indicate that coexpression of CA p38a
and p38b can further enhance the level of resistance of
resistant clones.
Because alterations of Topo1 (9, 28, 29) can confer resistance
to camptothecin derivatives (30–32), we then investigated

whether overexpression of CA p38b or downregulation of
p38a in HCT116-SN6 and HCT116-s cells influenced TopoI
expression (Western blotting) and activity (ICE bioassay;
ref. 23). No changes in TopoI expression or activity were detected
(Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that p38 effect on cell sensitivity to SN38 is not linked to quantitative alteration of TopoI
expression or to a difference in the number of TopoI-DNA
complexes.
Association of SB202190 with SN38 decreases resistance
to SN38 in vitro
Because p38a and p38b appear to play a role in the
development of resistance to SN38, we then assessed the
effect of blocking concomitantly the activity of both isoforms with SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38a and p38b,
on the sensitivity to SN38 by SRB assay in HCT116-s and
HCT116-SN6 cells. Incubation with SB202190 alone had
similar effect on cell growth in both SN38-sensitive and
SN38-resistant cells (Fig. 3A). When SN38 was associated
with SB202190, the IC50 in both sensitive and resistant cells
was decreased by 2-fold in comparison to cells treated only
with SN38 (Fig. 3A). The effect of SB202190 on p38 activity
was then monitored by kinase assay (Fig. 3B) that follows
p38 activity on its target protein ATF2. Basal p38 activity
was more pronounced in HCT116-SN6 than in HCT116-s
cells, as we previously described (13). SN38 treatment
enhanced p38 activity and this effect was inhibited by
SB202190 treatment. These experiments show that sensitivity to SN38 is largely increased when SB202190 is added to
the culture medium in both cell lines, indicating that

tumor size was 5-fold lower than in untreated mice (Fig. 4A, P <
0.001). Conversely, mice with HCT116-SN6 xenografts were less
sensitive to irinotecan, as tumor size was only half of that of
untreated mice at day 18 (300 mm3 in irinotecan-treated mice
and 600 mm3 in untreated mice, P ¼ 0.001) and tumor growth
was not completely blocked as in the case of HCT116-s xenografts. These observations further confirm that HCT116-SN6
cells are less sensitive to irinotecan than HCT116-s.
We then analyzed the in vivo response to irinotecan in
xenografts of HCT116-SN6 cells in which p38a had been
downregulated by shRNA or CA p38b overexpressed. As
before, tumor growth before irinotecan treatment was similar

HCT116-SN6-CAp38b, HCT116-SN6-ShLuc, or HCT116-SN6Shp38a cells), (Supplementary Fig. 4A), indicating that differential p38 expression did not influence tumor growth. However, HCT116-SN6-CAp38b tumors were less sensitive to
irinotecan treatment than control HCT116-SN6-pMSCV
tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Conversely, HCT116-SN6SHp38a tumors were slightly more sensitive to irinotecan
than control HCT116-SN6-ShLuc tumors (Supplementary
Fig. 4D). Overexpression of CA p38b and downregulation of
p38a were monitored by Western blot analysis of xenografts at
the end of the experiment (Supplementary Fig. 4C and 4E).
These in vivo results confirm that p38a downregulation
sensitizes HCT116 cells to irinotecan treatment whereas
p38b overexpression renders cells less sensitive to the drug.

with SN38 alone or in combination with SB202190 (Fig. 3C). As
for the different HCT116 cell lines, the association of SN38
with SB202190 also lowered the IC50 of HT29 (IC50: 9.8 and 5.5
nmol/L, respectively, P ¼ 0.005) and SW480 cells (IC50: 5.5 and
2.8 nmol/L respectively, P ¼ 0.0013), indicating that SB202190
effect on SN38 sensitivity is independent of the p53 and KRAS
status. Conversely, when CA a and b isoforms were coexpressed in SW480 or in HT29 cells, we found that cells became
more resistant to SN38 (Fig. 3D), further strengthening the role
of both p38a and p38b isoforms in the development of SN38
resistance.
We then asked whether the inhibition of p38a and p38b
activity by SB202190 could also affect sensitivity to 5-FU or
oxaliplatin in HCT116-s cells. Although both drugs induced
p38 phosphorylation, total p38 levels were not affected
(Fig. 3E), SB202190 had no impact on 5-FU cytotoxicity,
whereas it reduced oxaliplatin cytotoxicity (IC50: 350 nmol/
L for oxaliplatin and 550 nmol/L for oxaliplatin þ SB202190, P
¼ 0.005; Fig. 3F).
These data suggest that inhibition of p38a and p38b by
SB202190 enhances specifically the cytotoxic effect of SN38,
independently of the type of colon cancer cell lines.
HCT116-SN6 cells are resistant to irinotecan in a
xenograft model
To evaluate the behavior of SN38-resistant and -sensitive
HCT116 cell lines in vivo, HCT116-s and HCT116-SN6 cells were
s.c. injected in nude mice and mice treated with or without
irinotecan. Without treatment, similar tumor growth was
observed for both cell lines (Fig. 4A), but they responded differently to irinotecan. In mice with HCT116-s xenografts, tumor
growth was blocked by irinotecan, and at the end point (day 18),

with HCT116-SN6 cells. When tumors reached 100 mm3,
xenografted mice were divided in 4 groups: one group was
left untreated, one was treated with irinotecan alone, one with
SB202190 alone (32), and the last group with irinotecan and
SB202190. SB202190 inhibited tumor growth as efficiently as
irinotecan (Fig. 4B, P ¼ 0.792), whereas the combination
of irinotecan and SB202190 was statistically more effective
than irinotecan (P ¼ 0.001) or SB202190 alone (P ¼ 0.003) and
completely abolished growth of SN38-resistant xenografts,
making HCT116-SN6 cells behave like SN38-sensitive
HCT116-s cells (cf. Fig. 4A and B). This result provides
evidence that inhibition of p38a and p38b activity can reverse
resistance to irinotecan in vivo.
Survival was significantly longer in the groups treated with
irinotecan (P ¼ 0.016) or SB202190 (P ¼ 0.047) alone (median
survival ¼ 12 days in each group) than in untreated mice (NT;
median survival ¼ 7 days). Although irinotecan or SB202190
were efficient in inhibiting growth of HCT116-SN6 xenografts,
as previously described (20), the irinotecan þ SB202190
combination was much more effective, as survival was significantly better than with irinotecan alone (P ¼ 0.045). This
data shows an additive effect of SB202190 and irinotecan on
tumor growth.

sion in each clinical sample. Responders displayed less phospho-p38 staining than nonresponders [Fig. 5A; median QS
(range): 105 (35; 248.9) and 160 (46.7; 180), respectively, P ¼
0.0644] as evidenced by immunohistochemistry in Figure 5B
(compare samples from responders 1, 2, and 3 with samples
from nonresponders 4, 5, and 6). This is in agreement with our
in vitro results, where SN38-resistant HCT116-SN6 cells presented constitutive p38 activation.
These data were then analyzed using the ROC curves and
the Youden index to define a threshold (147) that separated
the QS depending on the response to treatment (Fig. 5C). Eight
of the 9 responders were correctly classified (QS lower than
147; sensitivity ¼ 89%). Thus, the correlation between low p38
phosphorylation and good response to FOLFIRI regimen was
almost significant (P ¼ 0.067, Fisher's test). Conversely, the
threshold did not correctly classify the nonresponders (specificity ¼ þ58%). This result means that high p38 phosphorylation is a marker of impaired response, and that other
mechanisms may also be involved in resistance to irinotecan
treatment, explaining the clinical response of nonresponder
patients with a low level of activated p38a.

Level of p38 phosphorylation is linked to impaired
response to FOLFIRI therapy in CRC patients
To address the clinical relevance of p38 activation on the
response to treatment, the level of p38a phosphorylation was
analyzed in a TMA composed of 21 primary colorectal carcinomas from metastatic CRC patients who received, following
surgery, first line FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Nine patients were
classified as responders (R) and 12 patients as nonresponders
(NR) according to the WHO recommendations (25). TMA
phospho-p38 signals were recorded to define a Quick Score
(QS) that reflected the level of nuclear phospho-p38 expres-

In the present study, we have demonstrated the role of the 2
p38 isoforms a and b in the resistance to irinotecan. Moreover
we have shown that inhibition of p38 enhances the efficacy of
irinotecan-based chemotherapies.
We have shown that p38 phosphorylation is increased in
SN38 resistant clones derived from HCT116 and SW48 cells,
suggesting that p38 activation might represent a general
resistance mechanism. Even though p38 constitutive activation was never reported in irinotecan-resistant cells, we could
reproducibly detect a low level of p38 phosphorylation in our
resistant clones. This low level of p38 activation may not be

sufficient to induce the negative regulatory controls such as
protein phosphatases explaining the permanent constitutive
activation (39). Moreover, we report that treatment with SN38
induces p38 activation both in SN38-sensitive and -resistant
HCT116 cells. Activation of p38 MAPK by SN38 has already
been observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (37), or in
response to other chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU
(35) or oxaliplatin (36). In these studies, p38 activation was
shown to be involved in the cytotoxic effect of the drugs, but
the authors did not discriminate between the four p38 isoforms. Here, we could provide experimental evidences showing that activation of both p38a and p38b isoforms inhibit the
cytotoxic effect of SN38 in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. In
addition, pharmacologic inhibition of p38a and p38b restores
sensitivity to irinotecan in a xenograft model.
p38 involvement in resistance to SN38 or irinotecan may be
explained by its role in cell survival. Indeed, p38 mediates
colon cancer cell survival pathway, in particular, via its role in
DNA repair and autophagy. First, p38 is one of the effector
kinases of the DNA damage sensor system starting with the
activation of ATM, ATR and DNA-PK (33). The CA p38 in colon
cancer cells may induce enhanced DNA repair in response to
chemotherapy and lead to drug resistance. Second, according
to Comes and colleagues, p38a inhibits autophagy and cell
death of CRC cells (34) demonstrating that p38a activity is
necessary for their survival.
Detection of p38 activation in clinical samples has already
been shown in reports studying the resistance to treatment.
Gutierrez and colleagues demonstrated that p38 activation
contribute to tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast
tumors (38). More recently, Wen and colleagues showed
that p38 inhibition enhances the sensitivity to arsenic trioxide and bortezomib in multiple myeloma (40). In line with
these results, we show that the level of phosphorylated p38a

is higher in patients unresponsive to chemotherapy compared with responders, suggesting that p38 activation is
correlated with irinotecan resistance in CRC. Indeed, 8 of
the 9 responders exhibit low phospho-p38 expression and
were correctly classified. Half of the nonresponders were
correctly classified, and in the rest of the nonresponders, we
could not detect high p38a phosphorylation. Both isoforms
a and b being involved in SN38 resistance, misclassified
nonresponder patients might present high p38b phosphorylation, a hypothesis that we could not test because of the
absence of available antibody directed against the active
form of p38b. In addition, other mechanisms of resistance,
independent of p38 activation may be present in this
patient's population. Altogether, our data show, for the first
time, that phosphorylation status of the MAPK p38a and
p38b isoforms may be a marker of resistance to irinotecanbased chemotherapies in CRC. They further suggest the use
of p38 inhibitors as an adjuvant therapy to potentiate the
efficacy of irinotecan-based chemotherapies in nonresponder CRC patients. Further studies using larger cohorts of
patients will be necessary to confirm this result.
