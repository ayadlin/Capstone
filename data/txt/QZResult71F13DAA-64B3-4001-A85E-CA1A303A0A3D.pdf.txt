ABSTRACT
Cisplatin is widely used against various tumors, but resistance is commonly
encountered. By inducing DNA crosslinks, cisplatin triggers DNA damage response
(DDR) and cell death. However, the molecular determinants of how cells respond to
cisplatin are incompletely understood. Since ubiquitination plays a major role in DDR,
we performed a high-content siRNA screen targeting 327 human ubiquitin ligases and
92 deubiquitinating enzymes in U2OS cells, interrogating the response to cisplatin. We
quantified γH2AX by immunofluorescence and image analysis as a read-out for DNA
damage. Among known mediators of DDR, the screen identified the ubiquitin ligase
G2E3 as a new player in the response to cisplatin. G2E3 depletion led to decreased
γH2AX levels and decreased phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) upon
cisplatin. Moreover, loss of G2E3 triggered apoptosis and decreased proliferation of
cancer cells. Treating cells with the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine led to increased
accumulation of single-stranded DNA upon G2E3 depletion, pointing to a defect in
replication. Furthermore, we show that endogenous G2E3 levels in cancer cells were
down-regulated upon chemotherapeutic treatment. Taken together, our results
suggest that G2E3 is a molecular determinant of the DDR and cell survival, and that
its loss sensitizes tumor cells towards DNA-damaging treatment.

for treating solid tumors. It induces intra- and interstrand
crosslinks of the DNA, resulting in the accumulation of
single-stranded DNA and DNA DSBs [3, 5]. Remarkably,
although cisplatin has been used for many years, the
cellular and molecular responses to it are incompletely
understood. In particular, the mechanisms of tumor cell
resistance are of high clinical relevance. We still lack
detailed understanding of how DNA damage by cisplatin
treatment is transduced to a signaling cascade and which
components determine whether this response leads to cell
cycle arrest, repair, or apoptosis. Therefore, our aim was to
find new regulators of the DNA damage response (DDR)
to cisplatin and potential targets whose inhibition could
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatment.
Ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes
(DUBs) play a major role in the DDR. Examples include
the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 that mediate the
response to DSBs [6–8]. BRCA1 is another important

INTRODUCTION
Cancer cells are sensitive to genotoxic stress, at least
in part due to a loss of checkpoints that would otherwise
prevent the unscheduled proliferation of cells that suffered
DNA damage [reviewed in 1, 2]. Chemotherapy and
radiotherapy take advantage of this sensitivity. Most DNAdamaging chemotherapeutics cause replication defects
during S phase. When cells try to replicate damaged DNA,
stalled and collapsed replication forks ultimately result in
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), often associated with
cell death.
Common DNA-damaging drugs include platinating
agents which are used in the clinics since the 1970s to
treat different types of cancer like testicular, ovarian,
cervical, head and neck, lung and colorectal cancer [3,
4]. Cisplatin, along with oxaliplatin and carboplatin, is
one of the most frequently prescribed chemotherapeutics

ubiquitin ligase with different roles in the DDR, in DNA
repair and in cell cycle checkpoint control [reviewed in 9].
Considering the importance of the ubiquitin system in
the DDR and open questions in the response to cisplatin
treatment, we performed an siRNA screen and depleted
cells of human ubiquitin ligases and DUBs. High-content
siRNA screening had previously been used to identify
components of the DDR and DNA repair [10, 11]. This was
also done in the context of cisplatin treatment, e.g. screening
the kinome to identify kinases in the response to cisplatin
treatment of ovarian cancer cells [12]. Phosphorylation of
the histone variant H2AX at Ser139 (then named γH2AX)
was often detected as a marker of DDR in siRNA screens
[e.g. 10, 13], but not in the context of cisplatin treatment
and the ubiquitin system. Here, we quantified γH2AX to
identify ubiquitin ligases and DUBs that modulate the DDR
upon cisplatin treatment, and numerous known and hitherto
unknown factors were found.
In particular, we identified the ubiquitin ligase G2E3
as a novel modulator of the response to DNA-damaging
treatment. “G2E3” stands for “G2-specific E3 ligase” since
it was originally reported as a putative ubiquitin ligase with
maximum mRNA levels in the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle [14]. The present work then aimed at understanding
how G2E3 is involved in the cellular response to DNA
damage. We observed that G2E3 depletion decreased the
phosphorylation of H2AX as well as the checkpoint kinase
1 upon cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, loss of G2E3
augmented p53 accumulation and apoptosis. When treating
cells with the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, together
with G2E3 depletion, the accumulation of single-stranded
DNA was increased, suggesting that DNA replication
was hindered. Finally, endogenous G2E3 levels in tumor
cells were reduced upon chemotherapy. In summary, we
introduce G2E3 as a novel modulator of the DDR whose
loss sensitizes cancer cells towards DNA damage.

to each siRNA. Fig. 1A shows candidates with substantial
increase (positive robust z-score) or decrease (negative
robust z-score) in γH2AX fluorescence intensity. For
primary results of the high-content siRNA screen,
please see Tab.  S1. As expected, our screen identified
gene products known to be involved in the DDR and
DNA repair, but also in the p53-pathway. Knockdown
of Mdm2 and knockdown of three regulators of the
p53-Mdm2-pathway, namely Mdm4 (Mdmx), RBBP6
(Retinoblastoma binding protein 6) and STUB1 (CHIP)
resulted in alleviated H2AX phosphorylation. Mdmx
heterodimerizes with Mdm2 to repress p53 transactivation
activity [17]. RBBP6 interacts with and activates Mdm2
[18]. The ubiquitin ligase STUB1 (CHIP) targets p53 for
degradation [19]. Knockdown of these p53 regulators
would lead to accumulation of p53 and thus induce cell
cycle arrest via CDKN1A/p21 [20]. Such an arrest in the
G1 phase of the cell cycle represents at least one plausible
mechanism to avoid replicative stress and thus DNA
damage.
The screen also identified the deubiquitinating
enzyme USP1 (ubiquitin-specific protease 1) which
deubiquitinates FANCD2, a protein involved in the
Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway [21]. USP1 is
also involved in translesion synthesis (TLS) of DNA by
deubiquitinating PCNA [22]. Furthermore, we found
two proteasomal subunits, PSMD7 and PSMD14 (26S
proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 7 and 14)
to be required for full response to cisplatin treatment.
In agreement, the proteasomal deubiquitinating enzyme
PSMD14 (also called POH1) has been shown to
negatively regulate the RNF8-dependent response to DNA
DSBs [23]. The identification of known transmitters of
the DDR and p53-pathway validates the screen. Notably,
the procedure also identified a putative ubiquitin ligase,
G2E3, as a transmitter of the DDR in this context. G2E3
was previously characterized as an essential gene product
for murine development, and as a determinant of cell fate
[24], but not DNA damage signaling. These features made
G2E3 an interesting candidate for further investigation.
G2E3 knockdown led to decrease in γH2AX levels after
cisplatin treatment as detected by immunofluorescence
(Fig. 1A). The knockdown of G2E3 with three different
siRNAs was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1B),
and decreased H2AX phosphorylation in cisplatin-treated
U2OS cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence
staining (Fig. 1C) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1D).
Thus, G2E3 is required for transmitting the DDR signal
on H2AX in cisplatin-treated cells.

RESULTS
A high-content siRNA screen identifies modulators
of the DDR to cisplatin, including G2E3
To identify new mediators of the cellular response
to cisplatin, U2OS cells were transfected with a collection
of siRNAs targeting 327 human ubiquitin ligases and 92
deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The osteosarcoma
cell line U2OS was chosen for better comparison with
previous studies on the DDR that used the same cell
line in immunofluorescence microscopy [8, 11, 15].
Furthermore, chemotherapy for osteosarcoma patients
includes cisplatin treatment [16]. After transfection, U2OS
cells were treated with cisplatin, fixed and subsequently
stained for γH2AX as a marker of the DDR. The extent
of γH2AX accumulation was quantified by automated
microscopy and image analysis. As a statistical measure
of H2AX phosphorylation, a robust z-score was assigned

siRNAs per gene. The cells were then treated with 30 μM cisplatin for 16 h, fixed and stained for γH2AX. Automated microscopy and image

p21 levels as well. Indeed, analysis by immunoblotting
revealed that p53 and p21 levels were augmented upon
G2E3 knockdown in untreated U2OS cells (Fig. 2A).
Knockdown of Mdm2 served as positive control, causing p53
induction and p21 expression. Similarly, p21 mRNA levels
were induced upon G2E3 knockdown (Fig. 2B). We also
performed a double-knockdown of Mdm2 and G2E3, but did
not observe additive p21 accumulation (Fig. 2A), arguing that
G2E3 and Mdm2 act on p53 activity in an epistatic fashion.
In contrast, a double-knockdown of G2E3 and p53 abolished
p21 induction (Fig. 2C), strongly suggesting that G2E3
knockdown induces p21 through p53. Taken together, these
results identify G2E3 as a negative regulator of p53 activity.

on the DDR itself. During the DDR, damaged DNA is
recognized by kinases of the PIKK (phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-related kinase) family, including ATM (ataxia
telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related).
Double-stranded DNA activates ATM and the checkpoint
kinase Chk2, while replicative stress and single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) trigger the ATR-Chk1 pathway. ATR is
found in a complex with ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein)
[25] and thereby capable of phosphorylating substrates
like the checkpoint kinase Chk1 [26, 27]. Cisplatin induces
crosslinks between DNA strands, forming obstacles to
transcription and replication, and giving rise to replicative
stress [3]. Stalled or collapsed replication forks activate the
ATR-Chk1 pathway. Secondary DNA DSBs presumably
activate the ATM-Chk2 pathway.
We investigated whether G2E3 knockdown affects
ATM and/or ATR signaling and observed that phosphoChk2 (Thr68) levels were not changed upon G2E3
knockdown and cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A). Instead, we
found that removing G2E3 decreased the phosphorylation of
Chk1 (Ser317) in U2OS cells after cisplatin treatment (Fig.
5B, 5C). This effect was stronger after a short exposure to
cisplatin (for 6 h), but still detectable after a longer exposure
(for 16 h). Thus, G2E3 is required to enable the activation
of Chk1, but not Chk2, in response to cisplatin treatment.

Depletion of G2E3 decreases the proliferation rate
of cancer cells
Next, we evaluated the role of G2E3 in cell
survival by continuously monitoring cell confluence after
siRNA transfection. After G2E3 knockdown in U2OS
(osteosarcoma) and HCT116 p53+/+ (colon carcinoma) cells,
we found that the amount of surviving and proliferating
cells was decreased (Fig. 3A, 3B). Surprisingly, this was
also found in HCT116 p53–/– cells (Fig. 3C). Hence, while
G2E3 is required to suppress p53 (Fig. 2), it also sustains
clonogenic survival by p53-independent mechanisms.

G2E3 knockdown inhibits Chk1 activation and
increases the accumulation of single-stranded
DNA after gemcitabine treatment

Removing G2E3 results in p53-independent
apoptosis

Chk1 activation is most relevant to replicative
stress during S phase. We therefore studied the impact of
G2E3 knockdown on the cellular response to an inducer
of replicative stress, i.e. gemcitabine. Gemcitabine
is a nucleoside analogue which perturbs replication
by getting incorporated into DNA instead of dCTP,
resulting in stalled replication forks. Furthermore,
gemcitabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, leading to
imbalance of the dNTP pool. We found that phosphoChk1 (Ser317) levels were decreased upon G2E3
knockdown in U2OS cells treated with gemcitabine
(Fig. 6A). Decreased phospho-Chk1 levels upon G2E3
knockdown were also observed in HCT116 p53+/+ and
HCT116 p53–/– cells after gemcitabine treatment (Fig.
6B). When we further investigated the impact of G2E3
on the DDR to gemcitabine treatment, we found that
G2E3 knockdown increased the fraction of cells that
contain high γH2AX levels upon gemcitabine treatment
(Fig. 6C). We hypothesized that this is due to increased
replicative stress and therefore investigated gemcitabineinduced accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
upon G2E3 knockdown. Accumulation of ssDNA
is due to perturbed replication but ongoing helicase
activity at replication forks. This can be detected by
immunofluorescent staining of exposed BrdU-labelled
DNA strands [28]. We found that cells in which G2E3
was depleted accumulated far more ssDNA in response

Since the amount of proliferating cells was decreased
upon G2E3 knockdown, we tested whether this correlates
with increased susceptibility to apoptosis. To this end,
we depleted U2OS cells of G2E3, followed by cisplatin
treatment and immunoblot analysis of caspase substrates.
Indeed, apoptosis was accelerated upon G2E3 knockdown,
as revealed by the detection of cleaved caspase 3 and
cleaved PARP-1 (Fig. 4A). Even in otherwise untreated
cells, induction of apoptosis upon G2E3 knockdown was
observed, and this was further enhanced by cisplatin.
Knockdown of G2E3 also led to increased apoptosis
in the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 (Fig. 4B), and
strikingly, also in p53-deficient HCT116 cells (Fig. 4C).
This observation suggests that G2E3 plays a p53independent role in avoiding apoptosis. These results are in
line with the embryonic lethality of G2E3 knock-out mice
as well as G2E3/p53 double knock-out mice, which die
due to apoptosis and involution of the blastocyst [24]. In
summary, the removal of G2E3 leads to increased apoptosis
in various cell lines in a p53-independent manner, pointing
to a pro-survival role of this gene product.

This accumulation was still observed in the presence of
a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD (Fig. 6E), arguing that it is
not a secondary effect of apoptosis. Taken together, these
results suggest that G2E3 depletion decreases ATR-Chk1
signaling and increases replicative stress in gemcitabinetreated cancer cells.

synchronized U2OS cells as well (Fig. S7A). Furthermore,
since G2E3 mRNA synthesis was reported to be decreased
upon γ-irradiation in HeLa cells [14], we tested whether
the same is true in response to chemotherapy. To this end,
we treated U2OS, HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53–/– cells
with cisplatin and determined the G2E3 mRNA levels
by quantitative RT-PCR. Indeed, we observed decreased
G2E3 expression after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 7A).
Likewise, treatment of U2OS cells with gemcitabine
reduced G2E3 mRNA levels (Fig. 7B), as well as treatment
with neocarzinostatin (Fig. S7B), suggesting general DNA
damage-responsive down-regulation of G2E3. Since none
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the available antibodies to G2E3 detected the protein in
blots of cell lysates, we followed an immunoprecipitationimmunoblot protocol to quantify the levels of G2E3.
This revealed that cisplatin decreased the levels of G2E3
protein as well (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, the amount of
overexpressed, HA-tagged G2E3 (but not co-expressed
GFP) was strongly decreased upon cisplatin treatment
(Fig. 7D). These results suggest that G2E3 does not only
regulate parameters within the DDR, but that it is itself
regulated by DNA damage, apparently at transcriptional
as well as posttranscriptional levels. It was reported
that p53 can repress G2E3 transcription via the large

in G2E3 expression by cisplatin remained unchanged
when depleting p53 (Fig. S7C). Accordingly, treatment
of HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53–/– cells with cisplatin
reduced G2E3 to a similar extent (Fig. 7A). Taken together,
DNA damage suppresses G2E3 levels in a manner that
does not depend on p53.

in a p53-independent manner. Our results strongly suggest
that G2E3 depletion alleviates ATR-Chk1 signaling and
enhances replicative stress in cancer cells. Thus, we
propose a model (Fig. 7E) according to that G2E3 acts as
a pro-survival factor. In part, this function is carried out
by sustaining the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway, thereby
avoiding replicative stress.
It has been shown previously that Chk1 depletion
augments cell death upon treatment with replication
inhibitors [30]. Thus, induction of apoptosis upon
depletion of G2E3 and DNA-damaging treatment could be
due to a decrease in phospho-Chk1 levels. This hypothesis
is supported by the fact that besides G2E3 knock-out [24],
apoptosis-dependent embryonic lethality has also been
shown in Chk1 knock-out mice [26]. Apoptosis in Chk1–/–
blastocysts is p53-independent, just as in G2E3 knockout cells, since double-knockout of Chk1 and p53 cannot
rescue or delay early lethality in Chk1–/– embryos [26].

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified G2E3, a putative
ubiquitin ligase, as a new modulator of the DNA
damage response and cell survival. We show that G2E3
is a negative regulator of p53 activity. The removal of
G2E3 leads to increased apoptosis by p53-independent
mechanisms, arguing for a pro-survival role of this
protein. Furthermore, DNA damage reduces G2E3 levels

Chk1 was first reported to be involved in signaling of
single-stranded DNA, but furthermore has been shown
to suppress apoptosis in response to replicative stress
in both p53-proficient and p53-deficient cells [30]. So
far, we could not identify the mechanism leading to
decreased Chk1 phosphorylation upon G2E3 depletion.

It is possible that proteins involved in the ATR-Chk1
pathway upstream of Chk1 are regulated by G2E3, but
so far, the physiological target proteins of G2E3 have
not been identified. The role of G2E3 could potentially
be to ubiquitinate its substrate or to be involved in its
regulation by protein-protein interaction. It was reported

that overexpressed GFP-G2E3 localizes to the nucleus
of several cell types, including Cos-7, SiHa and BSC40 cells, and that G2E3 can undergo nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling [31]. This is compatible with a role of G2E3
as a regulator of nuclear factors, e.g. p53 and Chk1.
Different regulators affect the stability and activity of
p53 by means of post-translational modifications (e.g.
phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation),
protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization
[reviewed in 32, 33, 34]. The main negative regulator of
p53 function and stability is the RING E3 ligase Mdm2.
Mdm2 and p53 interact at the N-terminal domain of
p53, and this interaction inhibits the transactivation of
genes by p53 [35, 36]. In addition, Mdm2 mediates the
proteasomal degradation of p53 [37, 38]. So far, we do
not have evidence for a direct regulation of p53 activity
through G2E3 (e.g. by ubiquitination). Possibly, G2E3
can indirectly disrupt the interaction of p53 and Mdm2 in
untreated cells, leading to the observed accumulation of
p53 and p21.
We also found that the cellular response upon G2E3
depletion depends on the specific chemotherapeutic drug
under study. G2E3 knockdown augments the DDR of
cells to gemcitabine treatment (increase in γH2AX levels,
Fig. 6A, 6C), whereas the DDR to cisplatin treatment is
reduced (decrease in γH2AX levels, Fig. 1C, 1D). The
reasons could be the different mechanisms of action of
both reagents. Cisplatin induces intra- and interstrand
crosslinks of the DNA, resulting in stalled replication forks
and accumulation of single-stranded DNA [3, 5]. On the
other hand, gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue which
disrupts replication by getting incorporated into DNA,
resulting in stalled replication forks, too. But moreover,
gemcitabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase which leads
to imbalance of the dNTP pool. Hence, the function of
G2E3 seems to be dependent on the biochemical pathways
involved. Of note, however, removing G2E3 decreased
cell survival regardless of which drug was applied.
Since depletion of G2E3 decreases Chk1 activity,
G2E3 inhibition may sensitize cancer cells in a similar

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

way as Chk1 inhibition, a strategy which has been
used in experimental cancer therapy as well as in early
clinical studies [reviewed in 39, 40, 41]. Other strategies
to interfere with Chk1 activation include the targeting
of its natural regulators, especially ATR [26, 27].
Upon replicative stress, Chk1 stability is regulated
by ubiquitination and degradation through E3 ligase
complexes containing Cul1 or Cul4A [42] and by the Fbx6
(F box protein 6)-containing SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F box) E3
ligase [43]. G2E3 appears to represent an E3 ligase that
specifically affects the levels of activated Chk1.
When exploring G2E3 expression in cancerous
tissue using the GeneSapiens gene expression database
[44], we found G2E3 expression to be substantially
increased in testicular cancer, especially in seminoma.
High G2E3 expression was also found in healthy human
testis tissue and in testis of adult heterozygous G2E3
mice carrying a reporter driven by the endogenous G2E3
promoter [24]. Most testicular cancers respond well to
cisplatin treatment, but therapeutic failures do occur.
Our results suggest that initially high G2E3 levels and/
or variations in the ability to degrade G2E3 in response to
DDR may contribute to such failures. The fact that G2E3
is suppressed in its levels by cisplatin treatment raises the
perspective of evaluating G2E3 as a predictive biomarker.
Furthermore, our findings bring up the question
whether G2E3 represents a suitable anticancer drug
target. In the past, two main strategies have been applied
to design modulators of the ubiquitin system [45]. Firstly,
small-molecule inhibitors have been developed in order to
block the catalytic activity of enzymes (e.g. E1-activating
enzyme inhibitors, E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitors,
proteasome inhibitors). Secondly, the interaction between
ubiquitin ligases and substrates has been prevented. The
advantage of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions is
their increased specificity, but for applying it to G2E3,
its substrates would first need to be identified. G2E3
consists of four domains that can act as E3 ligases (three
domains with similarity to both RING and PHD domains
and a fourth HECT domain) [31]. In vitro ubiquitin ligase

627

High-content immunofluorescence microscopy

activity was shown for two of the PHD/RING domains
[24]. Thus, the PHD/RING domains in G2E3 may
represent a suitable cancer drug target. Small molecules
inhibiting a RING domain have been designed in the past.
For instance, the compound HL198 targets the active site
of the RING type E3 ligase Mdm2 [46] and this blocks
p53 ubiquitination.
Platinating agents like cisplatin as well as other
chemotherapeutics are limited from reaching their full
potential due to resistance mechanisms and toxicities. It
was reported for several cancer types that patients respond
initially well to cisplatin therapy, but that the relapse rate
is high. Examples include treatment of small cell lung
carcinomas with a relapse rate of 95% [3] and treatment
of head and neck cancers for which cisplatin is the firstline therapy. Here, the response rate is only 20–30% [47].
Reasons for resistance towards cisplatin include increased
efflux or decreased influx, detoxification mechanisms
(e.g. by glutathione), increased DNA repair (e.g. through
activation of NER, MMR, and/or HR pathways) and
bypassing lesions during replication – or a combination of
these processes [3]. Factors involved in these pathways –
such as G2E3 – represent potential targets for overcoming
such resistance.

Cells were transfected and grown in 96-well imaging
plates (Becton Dickison) and treated as indicated. After
fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), cell permeabilization was performed using
0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then
incubated in blocking solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and
5% FCS in PBS) for 15 min. Immunofluorescence staining
was performed using the following antibodies in blocking
solution: mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser319) antibody
(Millipore) and Alexa Fluor-546 anti-mouse IgG (both
Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml; Invitrogen/Life Technologies).
Automated immunofluorescence microscopy was
performed using the high-content imaging platform BD
Pathway 855 System and the AttoVision image acquisition
software (Becton Dickinson). All assays were performed
in triplicates. For quantification of fluorescence intensity,
single-cell-based image analysis was performed using the
Hoechst signal to identify cell nuclei. For quantification,
the average relative fluorescence intensity derived from
γH2AX staining was determined per nucleus. The average
fluorescence intensity per well was then calculated and
background signals (determined by omitting the first
antibody) were subtracted.

METHODS

High-content siRNA screening

Cell culture, transfection and treatments

Cells were reverse-transfected with a Silencer Select
Ubiquitin Library (Ambion) containing siRNAs against
327 human ubiquitin ligases and 92 deubiquitinating
enzymes with three different siRNAs per target gene on
separate 96-well plates. The final siRNA concentration
was 10 nM. Automated transfection of U2OS cells was
performed using a Biomek 2000 laboratory automation
workstation (Beckman Coulter). 32 h after transfection,
cells were treated with 30 μM cisplatin for 16 h and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Staining was done
with Hoechst and the mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser319)
antibody (Millipore). High content automated microscopy
and image analysis were performed as described above.

U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco/
Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS and
antibiotics. siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed
by reverse transfection of U2OS and HCT116 cells
with 10 nM Silencer Select siRNAs (all Ambion/Life
Technologies) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen/
Life Technologies). Plasmid transfection of U2OS cells
was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen/
Life Technologies). For chemotherapeutic treatment,
we used cisplatin (Teva), gemcitabine (Actavis) and
neocarzinostatin (Sigma). For caspase inhibition, we used
Z-VAD (Sigma) and for proteasome inhibition MG132
(Calbiochem). Control cells were treated with the same
amount of solvent.

Statistical analysis of the screen
Normalization of the screen data was performed
using a robust z-score to correct for plate-to-plate
variations [48]:

Cloning of a plasmid to express HA-tagged G2E3
The G2E3 coding sequence was cloned into the
vector pCGN-HA. The G2E3 coding sequence was
amplified by PCR using pEGFP-C3-G2E3 [31] as a
template. Primers were designed to include XbaI and
KpnI restriction sites (5′-GCC GCC TCT AGA AAT GAA
AGT AAA CCT GGT GAC-3′ and 5′-CGG CGG GGT
ACC TTA ATG TCC AAT GTA ATG AG-3′), and these
restriction enzymes were used to clone the PCR product
into the vector. The correct sequence of pCGN-HA-G2E3
was verified by sequencing.

Sample value refers to the average γH2AX
fluorescence intensity per well. Median of all samples and
median absolute deviation of all samples were calculated
per plate. Using these values, the robust z-score was
calculated for each well of the 96-well plate and thus for
each siRNA. With the robust z-score, the effect of each
628

siRNA on the accumulation of γH2AX was determined.
After normalization of the data, a hit identification
strategy was applied to take into account how many of
the three different siRNAs per gene led to a significant
decrease or increase of γH2AX fluorescence intensity. Hit
identification was based on robust z-scores. Every siRNA
with a robust z-score of ≥ 2 or ≤ –2 was considered as a
hit. The sum of all three z-scores per gene was calculated
and the genes were ranked according to this cumulative
z-score. Candidates were identified if at least two siRNAs
reached the threshold of ≥ 2 or ≤ –2.

antibodies overnight at 4°C (mouse anti-β-Galactosidase
(Promega) and goat anti-G2E3 antibody (Santa Cruz)),
followed by incubation with 25 μl protein G-sepharose
(GE healthcare) for 1 h. As an additional control,
antibodies were incubated with buffer only. The immune
complexes were subjected to Western Blot analysis with
goat anti-G2E3 antibody (Santa Cruz).

Proliferation assay
For cell proliferation analysis, cells were reversetransfected with siRNAs and grown in 12-well imaging
plates (Corning). Cell proliferation was determined
by measuring cell confluence daily for five days by
bright-field microscopy with the Celigo cell cytometer
(Cyntellect/Brooks Automation).

Statistical analysis
The number of independent experiments is stated
with “n”. Error bars are depicted as standard deviation
(SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM) as stated in the
figure legend. An unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test was
used for the calculation of p-values. Asterisks are used to
visualize p-values in the following way: ***p < 0.001,
**p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, n.s. (not significant).

Cell synchronization by double thymidine block
For synchronization of cell cultures, thymidine
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium at a final
concentration of 2 mM for 16 h. Thymidine was washed
away by adding pre-warmed culture medium to the cells
for 5 min five times. Subsequently, the cells were further
incubated for 9 h. A second treatment with 2 mM thymidine
for 16 h was performed. After washing away thymidine as
before, the cells were released in fresh culture medium.

Immunoblot analysis and antibodies
Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
For detection of proteins, membranes were incubated with
antibodies diluted in 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline
solution containing 0.1% Tween-20. Antibodies against
phospho-groups were diluted in 5% BSA instead of milk
powder. The following primary antibodies were used: goat
anti-G2E3, mouse anti-hsc70, mouse anti-p53 (DO-1) (all
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Caspase 3, rabbit anticleaved Caspase 3, mouse anti-Chk1, rabbit anti-PARP, rabbit
anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser317), rabbit anti-phospho-Chk2
(Thr68) (all Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-Chk2,
mouse anti-Mdm2 (Ab-1), mouse anti-p21, mouse antiPARP (all Calbiochem), mouse anti-actin (AC-15), rabbit
anti-IgG (all Abcam), mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser319)
(Millipore), mouse anti-HA-tag (16B12, Covance), mouse
anti-GFP (Clontech). Primary antibodies were detected
by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Europe) using a Chemoluminescence
Imaging System (Intas).

Flow cytometry
For analysis by flow cytometry, cells were
harvested, fixed in ethanol, and stained with propidium
iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 30
μg/ml. Cell cycle profiles were obtained by quantifying
the DNA content using the flow cytometer Guava
EasyCyte Plus system and analyzed using ModFit
software (Verity Software House).

ssDNA assay
Detection of single-stranded DNA labeled with
BrdU was done as described previously [28, 49]. Cells
were reverse-transfected with siRNAs, incubated with
10 μM BrdU for 24 h and, under continued presence of
BrdU, treated as indicated. Before fixation, the cells were
preextracted at 4°C for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100, 20
mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, 50 mM NaCl, and 3
mM MgCl2. Samples were stained by immunofluorescence
as described earlier. BrdU was detected with mouse antiBrdU antibody (RPN20AB; Amersham/GE Healthcare).
The BrdU signal was quantified by high-content
immunofluorescence microscopy as described above.
Importantly, no DNA denaturing step (e.g. by HCl) was
performed, leaving only pre-formed single-stranded DNA
intermediates for detection.

Co-immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation, six 15 cm cell culture
dishes with adherent cells were used per sample. Cells
were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and harvested by scraping in lysis buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH  7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 1% NP-40,
0.1% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors). An
equal amount of each protein lysate was incubated with
