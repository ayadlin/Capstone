BACKGROUND: Advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with venous thromboembolism
(VTE). However, to the authors’ knowledge, the incidence of VTE in early NSCLC, predictors of VTE, and
the prognostic significance of VTE in NSCLC have not been explored. METHODS: Individual patient data
from 3 National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group trials were analyzed (n ¼ 1987 patients).
Clinical Trial BR.10 was a randomized study of postoperative vinorelbine and cisplatin versus observation in
patients with stage IB/II NSCLC (grading determined according to the TNM staging system). Clinical Trial
BR.18 was a randomized study of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without the metalloproteinase inhibitor
BMS-275291 in patients with advanced NSCLC. BR.21 was a randomized study of erlotinib versus placebo in
patients with previously treated NSCLC. The relations between VTE, treatment, concomitant medications,
and patient characteristics were explored in univariate and multivariate analyses. Survival analysis was
completed using Cox regression. RESULTS: The incidence of VTE ranged from 0% in patients with early
stage NSCLC on the observation arm of BR.10 to 7.9% in patients with advanced NSCLC who received
chemotherapy (BR.18). Patients with early stage NSCLC who received chemotherapy (BR.10) and patients
with previously treated NSCLC who received erlotinib or placebo (BR.21) had a VTE incidence of 3%. Factors that were found to be predictive of VTE included previous VTE (BR.18; P ¼ .001) and obesity (BR.10; P
¼ .03). In patients with advanced NSCLC, VTE was associated with shorter survival (BR.18: hazard ratio
[HR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.26-2.07 [P ¼ .0002]; BR.21: HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.57-3.04 [P <
.0001]). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with both early stage and advanced stage NSCLC, VTE occurred more
frequently in patients who received chemotherapy (but not erlotinib or BMS-275291). In patients with
advanced stage NSCLC, VTE was associated with obesity and a history of VTE. VTE was found to be progC 2009 American Cancer

VTE and NSCLC/Hicks et al

An association between cancer, including nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), and venous thromboembolism
(VTE), has been demonstrated previously.1,2 Large registry studies suggest that the relative risk of VTE in the setting of malignancy is approximately 6.51 and that VTE is
more common in advanced cancer.1,2 The association
between VTE and malignancy is most likely multifactorial, with tumor biology, disrupted homeostasis, the use
of central venous catheters, surgery, patient immobility,
concomitant medications, and systemic cancer therapy all
contributing.3,4
The correlation between cancer treatment and VTE
risk has been explored most thoroughly for breast cancer
and multiple myeloma. In breast cancer, both adjuvant
chemotherapy and hormone therapy increase the risk of
VTE.5-8 In myeloma, thalidomide increases the risk of
VTE, particularly when administered with chemotherapy
or dexamethasone.9,10 By using registry data, Chew et al
reported a 1-year cumulative incidence of VTE of 3% for
patients with all stages of NSCLC and small cell lung cancer.11 In their model, advanced stage was a significant predictor of VTE in patients with NSCLC.11 Khorana et al12
reported an odds ratio for VTE of 1.86 (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.67-3.38) in ambulatory lung cancer
patients who were receiving chemotherapy. An increased
risk of VTE also was reported with the use of the metalloproteinase inhibitor prinomastat in patients with
advanced NSCLC.13 However, the issues of whether there
is a significant risk of VTE in early stage NSCLC, which
factors predict for VTE occurrence, whether chemotherapy has an impact on the risk of VTE in NSCLC, and
whether VTE is associated with worse clinical outcomes
have been explored less thoroughly.
To address these issues, we undertook a retrospective
analysis of 3 randomized trials in NSCLC conducted by
the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical
Trials Group (CTG), 2 of which included a no-treatment
arm. Herein, we report the result of that analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

trial have been published previously.14-16 Briefly, BR.10
was a randomized study that compared 4 cycles of postoperative adjuvant vinorelbine and cisplatin with observation in patients with completely resected stage IB and II
NSCLC (grading determined according to the TNM
staging system).14 BR.18 was a randomized study of firstline chemotherapy with paclitaxel andcarboplatin with or
without the metalloproteinase inhibitor BMS-275291 in
patients with incurable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.15 BR.21
was a randomized study of erlotinib versus placebo (2:1
randomization) in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC
who had received previous systemic chemotherapy.16

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software
(Statistical Analysis System, Version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). Analyses were stratified by treatment arm.
Results were considered significant with a 2-sided P value of
5%. BR.18 and BR.21 were analyzed separately and as a
combined dataset, because these 2 trials evaluated patients
with advanced rather than early stage, resected NSCLC.
When appropriate, discrete variables were summarized according to the number and proportion of patients
that fell into each category and were compared using a
chi-square test. Continuous and ordinal categoric variables were summarized using the mean, median, standard
error, and minimum and maximum values and, when
appropriate, were compared using the F test. VTE was
defined as: 1) a history of VTE, a history of pulmonary
embolus or deep venous thrombosis reported on baseline
case report forms; 2) VTE on study, grade 2, 3, 4 or 5
deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus according
to version 2 of the Common Toxicity Criteria (Cancer
Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md) for BR.18
and BR.21; or, for BR.10, VTE was coded as CDVEN
(according to NCIC CTG Expanded Common Toxicity
Criteria) that occurred after randomization; and 3) VTE
at any time, a history of VTE, and VTE present at randomization or on study.

Trials and Patients

Predictive Analyses of VTE on Study
Baseline variables that were evaluated for their association
with VTE on study included the following: treatment

allocation, age (65 years or >65 years), sex, pathologic
subtype of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous, or
other), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, disease stage, smoking history (current, former, never or unknown), ethnicity (white or other),
baseline anemia (yes or no), previous resection (pneumonectomy, lesser resection, or other), previous major
comorbidity (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, both, or
neither), recent surgery (within 4 weeks of study entry),
previous radiotherapy, previous chemotherapy (none,
platinum based, or other), site of disease (lung only, liver
metastases, bone metastases, or other), weight loss (5%,
<5%, or unknown), Charlson comorbidity index (0 or
1þ), steroids at baseline, anticoagulant use at baseline,
antiplatelet agent use at baseline, hormone use at baseline,
erythropoietin use at baseline, obesity (body mass index
30 kg/m2 or >30 kg/m2), baseline platelet count (100149  109/L, 150-500  109/L, or >500  109/L), and a
previous history of VTE.
Univariate analyses evaluating the association
between each baseline variable and the outcome of interest
were performed using chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests,
or Mantel-Haenszel tests for categoric variables. Continuous variables were compared using analyses of variance.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine which baseline variables were associated independently with VTE occurrence. A stepwise variable
selection procedure was performed using the minimum
Akaike Information Criterion. For BR.10, because VTE
occurred only in the treatment arm, the multivariate
logistic regression model was fitted only for the treatment arm.

VTE and no-VTE groups adjusted for the same baseline
factors that were considered in our multivariate analysis of
factors that were predictive of VTE, excluding a history of
VTE, which was excluded because historic VTE was
included in the definition of ‘‘VTE occurrence’’ (VTE at
any time) that was used for the survival portion of our
analyses.

RESULTS
Baseline Patient Characteristics
Baseline characteristics for the patients in each of the 3 trials are displayed in Table 1. The median age, the proportion of women, and the proportion of patients with
adenocarcinoma were similar for the 3 studies. Differences in disease stage and performance status were consistent
with differences in study entry criteria. A small number of
patients in each trial had a history of VTE before study
entry. However, in each trial, the number of patients
receiving anticoagulants at the time of study entry
exceeded the number of patients with a history of previous
VTE. Other reasons for anticoagulant use were recorded
only for BR.18 and included atherosclerotic heart disease
(5 patients), peripheral vascular disease (2 patients), atrial
fibrillation (4 patients), stroke (1 patient), and superior
vena caval obstruction (1 patient). The remaining patents
were receiving prophylactic anticoagulants. Few patients
were receiving agents that had a known association with
thrombosis, such as hormones or erythropoietin, at study
entry.

Factors Predictive of VTE
Prognostic Analyses of VTE on Survival
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to the time of death from any cause; otherwise, it was censored at last date the patient was known to
be alive at the end of the trials. Distributions of OS were
summarized using Kaplan-Meier plots. A Cox proportional hazards model with VTE as a time-dependent covariate was used to study the effect of VTE on OS. The
reported P values along with hazard ratios (HRs) and their
confidence intervals (CIs) were based on the analysis
stratified by treatment arm for the respective trials. Multivariate survival analyses were conducted to compare the
5518

VTE was observed in all trials (Table 2). VTE incidence
ranged from 0% in observation patients on BR.10 to
7.9% overall in BR.18. In BR.10, VTE was associated significantly with the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (P ¼ .015). Seven patients experienced VTE in the
experimental arm, whereas no patients in the observation
arm developed this complication. On both univariate
analysis and multivariate analysis of the chemotherapy
arm of BR.10, only obesity (P ¼ .02) was found to be predictive of VTE on study.
In BR.18 and BR.21, the occurrence of VTE was independent of treatment arm; however, the VTE incidence

Prognostic Effect of VTE at Any Time
on Survival
The OS of the patients who experienced VTE at any time
(past history, at or after randomization), compared with
patients who did not experience VTE, is illustrated in
Figure 1. In BR.18 and BR.21 (the 2 trials in patients with
advanced NSCLC), the Cox regression model with VTE
occurrence as a time-dependent covariate indicated that
VTE was associated with shorter OS (BR.18: HR, 1.61;
95% CI, 1.26-2.07; BR.21: HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.57-3.04).
However, VTE at any time was not prognostic in BR.10.
5520

The association between VTE and survival that we
observed on univariate analysis in BR.18 and BR.21 was
explored further after adjusting for other important baseline factors. In both BR.18 and BR.21, VTE occurrence
was associated independently with shorter OS. In BR.18,
the HR for death if VTE occurred was 1.35 (95% CI,
1.04-1.75; P ¼ .026). In BR.21, the HR for death if
VTE occurred was 2.128 (95% CI, 1.50-2.98; P <
.0001). When the trials were pooled, the HR was 1.60
(95% CI, 1.30-1.98; P < .0001) after adjusting for other
known prognostic factors. Causes of death for patients

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 1. Overall survival is illustrated by venous thromboembolism (VTE) status in (A) National Cancer Institute of
Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trial BR.10, a randomized study of the
postoperative combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin versus
observation in patients with stage IB/II nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC); (B) NCIC Clinical Trial BR.18, a randomized
study of the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin with
or without the metalloproteinase inhibitor BMS-275291 in
patients with advanced NSCLC; and (C) NCIC Clinical Trial
BR.21, a randomized study of erlotinib versus placebo in previously treated patients with NSCLC.

Our analyses suggested that the risk of VTE is increased in
patients with NSCLC at all stages who receive chemotherapy whether it is given as postoperative adjuvant therapy
or for the treatment of advanced disease. We also observed
that patients with advanced NSCLC also have a higher
risk of VTE than patients with early stage disease, even if
they are not receiving cytotoxic therapy, as demonstrated
by the 2.7% incidence in BR.21 placebo-treated patients
compared with the 0% incidence in the observation arm
of BR.10. Although it is possible that investigators did not
report VTE events for patients who were randomized to
the observation arm of BR.10 because of less frequent
follow-up compared with patients on chemotherapy who
were seen weekly, it appears that adjuvant chemotherapy
for early stage NSCLC is associated with an increased risk
of nonfatal VTE. This result is consistent with reports
from breast cancer trials in which both adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy were correlated with an
increased risk of VTE.5-7
The results of the current study also are in keeping
with the increased risk of VTE in patients with advanced
lung cancer who received chemotherapy reported by Khorana et al.12 How chemotherapy contributes to VTE risk has
not to our knowledge been elucidated completely but likely
involves a combination of direct endothelial damage and
down-regulation of endogenous anticoagulants.17 Other
drugs that are used frequently in both cancer and noncancer
patients, particularly hormones18,19 and erythropoietin,20-22
are associated with an increased risk of VTE in the malignant setting.5-7 In the current series, few patients were
receiving hormone therapy, most likely because of the nature of the lung cancer population; therefore, we did not
identify an association with the use of oral contraceptives or
hormone-replacement therapy. Similarly, only 2 patients
received with erythropoietin; however, it is interesting to
note that 1 of those patients did experience VTE.
Although the patients randomized to BR.18, all of
whom received chemotherapy and had advanced NSCLC,
had the highest incidence of VTE, the addition of the
metalloproteinase inhibitor BMS-275291 did not
increase the risk. This result is in contrast to that observed

by Behrendt and Ruiz,13 who reported an increased risk of
VTE when 15 mg of the metalloproteinase inhibitor prinomastat was added to platinum-based chemotherapy.
The lack of any association of VTE with BMS-275291 in
our analysis of BR.18 suggests that the increased incidence
of VTE observed with prinomastat may not be a class
effect. Alternatively, the absence of an association between
VTE and metalloproteinase use in the current study may
reflect a dose effect. Behrendt and Ruiz13 did not report
an increased incidence of VTE when lower doses of prinomastat were administered. In BR.18, only a single dose
level (1200 mg) of BMS-275291 was tested.
The 2.7% rate of VTE in patients with very
advanced NSCLC in BR.21 was intermediate between
that of the patients in BR.10 who did not receive adjuvant
chemotherapy (0%) and that observed in BR.18 (7.9%),
in which all patients received chemotherapy. The addition
of erlotinib did not appear to increase the risk of VTE. To
our knowledge to date, there have been few published
reports of an increased risk of VTE with erlotinib. Similarly, sunitinib and sorafenib (also tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the vascular endothelial growth factor
[VEGF] receptor) have not been associated with high rates
of VTE in early trials.23 However, semaxibin (another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGF) has been associated with moderate-to-high VTE rates, particularly
when combined with chemotherapy.23,24 In addition, a
growing body of literature suggests that bevacizumab, a
recombinant monoclonal antibody against VEGF, may
increase the risk of VTE.25 It is possible that the thrombogenecity of antiangiogenic agents is not a class effect and
depends on the specific mechanism of action of each drug.
Alternatively, the propensity of antiangiogenic agents to
increase VTE incidence may depend on tumor type,
tumor stage, and whether the antiangiogenic agent is
5522

given as monotherapy or in combination with other
agents. In the current study, erlotinib was administered as
monotherapy to patients with previously treated NSCLC.
We observed that obesity was predictive for VTE in
patients with early stage NSCLC. The association
between obesity and VTE is well recognized in the general
population,17-19 and a similar association also has been
reported in cancer patients.19 Although the cause is not
known, it appears reasonable to postulate that both
decreased mobility and increased endogenous estrogen
production may contribute to an increased risk of VTE in
obese patients. Although obesity was predictive for VTE
in BR.10, we were unable to confirm similar effects in
BR.18 and BR.21.
In BR.18, predictive factors for VTE included a previous history of VTE, which is a well recognized risk factor for subsequent VTE in other settings, particularly
postoperatively.21 This is important, because it suggests
that it may be possible to identify patients with advanced
NSCLC at particularly high risk of VTE who may benefit
from VTE prophylaxis. In support of this is our observation that patients who were receiving anticoagulation did
not have a higher risk of VTE, even when they were
receiving this treatment for previous thrombotic events.
An interesting observation was that on-study VTE
was more likely to be fatal in BR.18 and BR.21 compared
with BR.10. The reasons for this are unclear. Episodes of
sudden death or sudden dyspnea and death in patients
with advanced NSCLC sometimes are attributed to VTE,
although postmortem confirmation of this usually is not
undertaken. It is possible, therefore, that some of the fatal
VTEs that were reported in BR.18 and BR.21 were sudden cardiac or neurologic events unrelated to VTE.
VTE at any time was prognostic in BR.18 and
BR.21. Although this may be explained in part by the
Cancer

December 1, 2009

VTE and NSCLC/Hicks et al

incidence of fatal VTE, an increased risk of non-VTE
death cannot be ruled out. An association between VTE
occurrence and increased cancer mortality has been
reported in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy:
Kuderer et al26 demonstrated that the HR for death
among 4458 patients with various malignancies was 4.90
(95% CI, 2.27-10.60; P < .001) in patients who had
experienced VTE. Pulmonary embolism was the cause of
death for 5.4% of patients, which suggests that, similar to
the current study, the shorter survival cannot be explained
by VTE events alone. It has been postulated that this
increase in the death rate may be caused by the up-regulation of endogenous procoagulant factors in malignancy.27
In addition to being prothrombotic, there is preclinical
evidence that procoagulant factors, such as tissue factor
and thrombin, may contribute to angiogenesis, which, in
theory, could potentiate cancer growth.28,29 An elevation
of other nonspecific markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis also has been noted frequently in cancer.30 For example, 1 study of patients with lung cancer noted a
correlation between elevated d-dimer levels and poor survival, even after controlling for other recognized prognostic predictors.31 Recently, genetic polymorphisms in
selectins have been associated with VTE in cancer
patients.32
There have been several trials of thromboprophylaxis
in cancer patients. Particularly with respect to lung cancer,
the TOPIC II trial, which compared the low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) certoparin with placebo in 547
patients with advanced NSCLC, demonstrated a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of VTE (4.5% vs 8.3%; P ¼
.07).33 That study has not reported survival results, and the
full publication is awaited. Both the American Society for
Clinical Oncology34 and the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network35 recommend the use of prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH for hospitalized patients with
cancer in view of the high rate of VTE in this population.36
Neither guideline goes so far as recommending prophylactic
anticoagulation for ambulatory patients who are receiving
chemotherapy, although there is now mounting evidence to
suggest that such patients are at increased risk for VTE.
Khorana et al37 have developed a predictive model for VTE
in patients who are receiving chemotherapy. Patients in
their high-risk group had VTE rates of approximately 7%
in both their derivation and validation cohorts. This rate is
nearly identical to the VTE rates we report here in the

BR.18 trial of chemotherapy in patients with advanced
NSCLC.
The current study had several limitations. The analyses were conducted retrospectively. Because VTE incidence
was not a prospectively planned endpoint of these trials, it
is possible that some events of VTE were not reported. In
addition, objective diagnostic criteria for VTE were not prespecified or required of participating centers. However, we
did attempt to verify all VTE events by manually reviewing
all enrollment data and all adverse event reports. We
believe, however, that most of the events that we classified
as such were indeed VTE in view of the finding that the
rate of VTE in BR.18 (7.9%) was nearly identical to the
8.3% rate reported in the TOPIC II trial, in which there
was greater verification of the diagnosis because VTE was
the primary endpoint of the study.33
In summary, we believe the current study is the largest
review of VTE reported in NSCLC to date. We have demonstrated that VTE is a relatively common occurrence in
individuals with lung cancer, particularly in patients with
advanced NSCLC and those who receive chemotherapy.
We have also demonstrated that obesity and a history of
VTE may increase the risk of VTE. It is noteworthy that
VTE at any time was identified as a prognostic factor for
patients with advanced NSCLC. The possibility that
manipulation of the hemostatic balance may influence not
only VTE occurrence but also survival is enticing and is
being explored in several lung cancer trials. These ongoing,
randomized controlled trials assessing treatment with
LMWH versus no anticoagulation in patients with various
stages of lung cancer may provide a definitive answer with
regard to the efficacy of VTE prophylaxis and may shed further light on whether there is a survival benefit with such
treatment. In the interim, patients who are receiving chemotherapy for NSCLC should be counseled on the increased
risk of VTE in this setting and on how to recognize the
symptoms of VTE.
