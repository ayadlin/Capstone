ABSTRACT
Patients with unresectable and advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
usually have short survival due to a lack of effective treatment. This multicenter, single
arm, open labeled, prospective study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
and safety of sorafenib combined with best supportive care (BSC) in these patients.
We enrolled 44 patients with unresectable and advanced ICC who were treated with
sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) and BSC. The primary endpoint was disease control
rate (DCR) at week 12, and the secondary endpoints included time to progression
(TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of therapy
(DOT), and adverse events (AEs). Our results showed that the DCR was 15.9%, the
median TTP was 5.6 months, and the median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 5.7 months
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-4.1 months; 3.7-8.5 months), respectively. The
median DOT was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.9-3.9 months). AEs of grades 1 and 2 events
occurred in 75% of patients, and AE of grade 4 (severe) was observed in 1 patient.
Therefore, sorafenib in combination with BSC had an acceptable DCR and safety profile
in patients with unresectable and advanced ICC.

INTRODUCTION

Surgical resection is currently the only established
treatment to achieve possible long-term survival in ICC
patients [3]. Unfortunately, the resectability, curability
and survival rates of ICC are extremely low because this
malignancy is aggressively invasive and most patients
present with unresectable and advanced diseases at their
initial medical visit [4-8]. For these patients, effective
treatment is very limited. Both 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and
gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens have been
recommended for hepatobiliary cancers in the National

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which
arises from the epithelial cells of intrahepatic bile ducts,
accounts for 10%-15% of all primary hepatic malignancies
[1]. Although the prevalence of ICC is still lower than
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the incidence and
mortality associated with this malignancy are increasing
worldwide [2].

Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines [9],
and numerous studies support the use of gemcitabinecisplatin combination therapy for biliary tract carcinomas
(BTC) as an internationally recognized standard [10-12].
Unfortunately, few studies have analyzed the impact
of these treatments specifically in ICC patients. Most
published reports on chemotherapy were conducted on
patients with heterogeneous types of biliary tract cancers
and the results were conflicting [13-15]. Furthermore,
response to treatment was poor even to a combination
of drugs [16]. Although there were a limited number of
studies using transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or
photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat advanced ICC, there
were not enough evidences to support that these treatments
to be effective [17-19]. To the best of our knowledge, there
are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
targeted molecular therapies for ICC [20].
Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of rapidly
accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinase, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor -2/-3 (VEGFR-2/-3),
platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β),
Flt3 and C-kit receptor, has been recommended in the
therapy of solid cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and
HCC [21]. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effectiveness
of sorafenib for ICC patients remained largely unknown.
Previous studies have shown sorafenib inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis in human ICC cell
lines in vitro. Sorafenib also displayed antitumor activity
with prolonged survival in an ICC animal model [22]. It is
therefore logical to hypothesize that sorafenib is clinically
effective for patients with advanced ICC.
This multicenter, single arm, open labeled,

prospective study aimed to assess the effectiveness
and safety of sorafenib combined with best supportive
care (BSC) in patients with unresectable and advanced
ICC. This is the first and only prospective pilot study to
examine the use of sorafenib specifically for ICC without
the confounding factor contributed by other types of
cholangiocarcinoma.

RESULTS
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics
There were 44 patients (mean age, 56.5±10.6 y)
with advanced and unresectable ICC who were enrolled
in this study (Table 1). Of them, 18 patients (40.9%)
had no disease-related symptoms at the inception of the
study. The mean tumor diameter was 5.6±4.1 cm. Twenty
patients (45.6%) had a history of surgical resection and
developed recurrence which was assessed to be unsuitable
for further surgical management. Eight patients (18.2%)
received previous therapies for ICC including TACE (n
= 3), chemotherapy (n = 3) and radiotherapy (n = 2), but
all of them had stopped these treatments for more than
2 months prior to entry of this study (Table 1). Liver
function assessments revealed that 75.0% of patients had
normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 63.4% had
normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, 43.2%
had normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and 25.0%
had normal gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels
(Table 1).

overall imaging evaluation showed PR in one patient (4%)
and SD in 15 patients (60%) at 6 weeks; CR was detected

weeks. At the last visit, CR was observed in one patient

(15%) at the last imaging examination (Table 2). Of these
patients, progressive disease (PD) was not observed within
1 year after therapy in two patients.
As shown in Table 3, overall evaluation showed a
disease control rate (DCR) of 53.9% and a derived DCR
of 15.9%. In addition, the median time to progression
(TTP) was 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.9 months- NA; Figure

For grades 0-2 AEs, no dose modification was
required. Patients with grade 3 AEs had their doses
modified to sorafenib 400 mg sorafenib once daily.
Patients with grade 4 hematologic AEs discontinued
therapy until the AE resolved to grade 2 or lower. In
total, 11 patients had dose modifications, including seven
patients that had their doses decreased as well as four
patients that were readministered sorafenib following
discontinuation. Eleven patients with nonhematologic
grade 4 AEs completely discontinued the therapy.

Safety outcomes

A previous study showed sorafenib had in vivo
antitumor activity and it prolonged survival of mice
harboring peritoneally disseminated ICC [22]. However,
clinical evidence to show the effectiveness of oral
sorafenib in patients with unresectable and advanced ICC
is still lacking. In this prospective open-labeled study, the
effectiveness and safety were studied in 44 ICC patients
who received sorafenib combined with BSC. The overall
DCR was 53.9%, the median TTP was 5.6 months, the
median PFS was 3.2 months, the median OS was 5.7
months, and the DOT was 2.9±3.4 months. In addition,
most AEs experienced by the patients were grades 1 or

DISCUSSION

The duration of therapy (DOT) was 2.9±3.4 months
with a median of 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.9-3.9 months;
data not shown). Based on the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AEs)
version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE 4.0), AEs were observed in 33
patients (75%) treated with sorafenib. The most commonly
observed AEs were classified as grades 1 or 2 which and
included diarrhea, hand and foot skin reaction, and fatigue.
Grade 4 severe AE (SAE) (hand and foot skin reaction)

2 which included diarrhea, hand and foot skin reaction,
and fatigue. Thus, sorafenib combined with BSC had
acceptable disease control and safety profile for ICC
patients.
Two randomized studies and one meta-analysis have
shown the effectiveness of doublet gemcitabine-cisplatin in
patients with heterogeneous types of biliary tract cancers at
advanced stage. Although exploratory sub-group analysis
by Valle et al. [11, 12] showed benefits of the gemcitabinecisplatin combination therapy in all patients despite
primary tumor sites, and no significant differences in
treatment effect were observed in OS and PFS. Knowledge
on current treatment for unresectable and advanced ICC
is still limited and few studies have specifically focused
on ICC. Indeed, only 28 patients of 83 (33.7%) had ICC
in the study by Okusaka et al. [10] and only 21.9% in the
study by Valle et al. [12]. For unresectable ICC, the NCCN
Guidelines recommend gemcitabine/cisplatin combination
therapy, fluoropyrimidine-based or gemcitabine-based
chemotherapy regimens, fluoropyrimidine chemoradiation
or supportive care [9]. However, clinical studies comparing
various chemotherapeutic agents and their combinations
showed conflicting results in patients with unresectable
ICC. In a study using hepatic arterial infusion comparing
floxuridine alone or with bevacizumab, the median
survivals were 39.3 and 28.5 months, respectively [23].
In another study, the DCR in patients with advanced
and unresectable ICC treated with capecidtabine plus
cisplatin was 41.5% [24]. Other studies which included
patients with ICC and other types of cholangiocarcinoma
reported gemcitabine induced response rates of 0 to 36%
and median survivals of 4.6 to 14.0 months were reported,
while a study using mitomycin C, cisplatin, taxane and
irinotecan (CPT-11) reported a response rate of 10% and
median survival rates of 4.5 to 6.1 months [25-28].
Supplemental Table 1 describes and compares the
effects of various treatments for ICC. In patients with
locally advanced or metastatic BTC, those treated with
gemcitabine-cisplatin combination therapy, the median
OS were 11.7 [11] and 11.2 [10] months, the median
PFS were 8.0 [11] and 5.8 [10] months and the DCR
were 81.4% [11] and 68.3% [10]. Although treatment
with sorafenib resulted in lower median PFS and OS of
3.2 and 5.7 months, respectively, and a DCR of 53.9%,
direct comparisons between the results of these studies
to suggest sorafenib to be inferior to chemotherapy is not
appropriate because of differences in patient selection and
case-mix. Furthermore, these studies were conducted in
patients with heterogeneous types of biliary tract cancers
which included hilar cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, Vater’s ampulla
cancer, and ICC. There were no attempts for these studies
to separately report on the effectiveness of systemic
chemotherapy on the different types of biliary tract
cancers [10, 11]. This point is particularly important given
that ICC exhibits different mechanisms of carcinogenesis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanisms, molecular profiles, and biologic behaviors
from the other biliary tract cancers, such as hilar
cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,
and gallbladder cancer [29, 30]. A recent study revealed
that KRAS and TP53 mutations were relatively common
in cholangiocarcinoma, particularly in extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, while IDH1/2 and BRAF mutations
were considerably more prevalent in ICC [31]. Notably,
the authors also suggested that the emerging data pointed
to an overlapping molecular profile between subclasses
of ICC and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma). The
difference in genetic mutations related to different signal
pathways between ICC and other biliary tract cancers
might contribute to a varied response to chemotherapy
and molecular targeted therapy. Although there are no
sufficient data to indicate a difference in response to
chemotherapy between ICC and other biliary tract cancers,
some studies have suggested such a difference exists [32].
There is a study which showed the overall response rate to
be better in patients with gallbladder cancer than for those
with ICC (54.4% versus 21.4%, respectively) [33].
ICC is generally considered as a cancer of high
malignancy with less than 4 months survival in patients
not treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy
[34, 35], As our study showed a median OS in patients
treated with sorafenib to be 5.7 months, sorafenib should
be considered as a treatment options for advanced ICC.
The overlapping molecular profile between subclasses of
ICC and HCC as mentioned previously suggests a possible
role of sorafenib in selected ICC patients [31].
Apart from a few case reports which studied
the effect of sorafenib in patients with ICC, this is the
first prospective pilot study to examine the use role of
sorafenib in ICC patients. In a case report of two patients
with advanced ICC who were treated with sorafenib,
LaRocca et al showed disease control for >4 months. One
patient received oxaliplatin combined with gemcitabine
after sorafenib therapy survived for 16 weeks and another
patient achieved stable survival for 24 weeks before the
case report [36]. In another case report, sorafenib extended
the survival of a patient with advanced ICC for more than
4 years [37]. The 12-week DCR of 53.9% and a median
OS of 5.7 months in the present study are better than
those reported in phase II clinical trials on sorafenib in
patients with all types of cholangiocarcinoma [13, 14,
36-38]. These studies also suggested that addition of
sorafenib did not confer any survival benefits but was
associated with increased toxicity [14, 15]. Differences
in patient populations and types of cholangiocarcinoma
(extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ECC] vs. ICC)
can account for the the difference in response rates to
sorafenib, as cholangiocarcinomas developed from
different origins show different biological characteristics,
chemosensitivies, and prognoses [39, 40]. Thus, further
studies comparing the effectiveness of sorafenib plus
BSC with BSC alone in patients with advanced ICC are

required.
As reported in the previous phase II studies of
sorafenib in cholangiocarcinoma, most of AEs in our
present study were grades 1 and 2, which consisted
mainly of diarrhea, hand and foot skin reaction and fatigue
(Supplemental Table 2) [13,38]. Of note, only one patient
experienced a grade 4 SAE with severe hand and foot skin
reaction. Thus, the patients enrolled in this study showed
favorable tolerance to sorafenib.
This study had limitations. First, it is a noncontrolled, single arm study. The prognostic data of other
treatments used for comparison were based on previously
published reports. Second, patients who were included in
this study to receive sorafenib were based on their own
free will after discussion with their clinicians. Third,
the patients were highly selected given the extensive
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the number of
non-evaluated patients at 6-weeks (19/44) and at 12-weeks
(32/44) were high.
In conclusion, this prospective pilot study showed
sorafenib combined with BSC had a modest effect and
was safe for patients with advanced ICC. Further properly
conducted studies are required to define the role of
sorafenib in patients with unresectable ICC.

4.0); (5) severe non-healing wound, gastrointestinal
bleeding, fracture, major surgery, open biopsy and severe
trauma within 4 weeks of the study; (6) thrombosis
or embolic events within 6 months of the study; (7)
uncontrolled ascites; (8) suspected or known allergy to
drugs used in the study; (9) bone marrow, stem cell or
other organ transplantation; and (10) the presence of
mixed hepato-cholangiocarcinoma.
The assumed DCR was 35% and invalid DCR was
15%. Using a ‘Hern single stage design, given α=0.05
and a power of 90%, a sample of at least 38 patients were
needed. If 10 patients were observed in the study to reach
the disease control, the DCR would be regarded as >15%;
considering of a 15% drop-off, the total number needed
for enrolled was 45.
During the study period, 44 consecutive patients
who met the above inclusion and exclusion criteria were
recruited into the study. This study was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committees of the respectively centers.
Informed consent was obtained from all the patients prior
to enrollment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients were treated with 400 mg of oral sorafenib,
twice daily. Treatment was continued until disease
progression, intolerable AEs, or patient withdrawal from
the study. In the event of any intolerable toxicity as graded
according to the NCI-CTCAE 4.0, the dose of sorafenib
was reduced to 400 mg daily or 400 mg every other day or
the therapy was discontinued. The dose of sorafenib was
readjusted to 400 mg twice daily once the adverse events
resolved. All patients who withdrew from this study due to
toxicity were followed-up until the toxicity resolved and,
thereafter, until they died.
The BSC used in the study included protection of
liver function, relief of symptoms, and nutritional support.

Treatment with sorafenib and BSC

Study design and patients
This is a multicenter, single arm, open labeled,
prospective study, conducted in the Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital of Second Military Medical University,
the Anhui Provincial Hospital, the Tongji Hospital of
Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the
Jiangsu Provincial Peoples’ Hospital, and the Beijing
Cancer Hospital. ICC was diagnosed by histopathological
or cytological examination.
The inclusion criteria were: (1) age ≥18 years;
(2) expected survival of ≥12 weeks; (3) advanced ICC
assessed as inoperable by three experienced hepatobiliary
surgeons in each center; (4) an ECOG performance
status score of 0-2; (5) normal bone marrow, liver, and
kidney function before the study; (6) negative serum/
urine pregnancy test within 7 days before the study for
women of child-bearing age; and (7) ability to take oral
medication. In addition, only patients with RECISTevaluable disease at baseline were included.
The exclusion criteria were: (1) other malignancies;
(2) associated major organ dysfunction or failure; (3)
received systemic chemotherapy, molecular targeted
therapy (including sorafenib) or biological response
modifiers within 2 months of the study; (4) human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other severe
active infection (> grade 2 according to the NCI-CTCAE

Patient evaluation and follow-up
Patients were followed-up once every 3 weeks
(±3 days) within the first 1-3 months, and once every 6
weeks (±7 days) thereafter. Imaging examinations (chest/
abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI); cranial imaging or bone scans,
if necessary) were performed within 4 weeks before
initiation of sorafenib therapy (the screening period)
and once every 6 weeks during sorafenib therapy. Three
experienced radiologists independently evaluated the
imaging data, and any controversies on imaging findings
were resolved by discussion. The therapeutic effectiveness
was re-evaluated within 30 days after the last therapy. AEs
and any alterations in dosage of sorafenib were recorded.
During follow-up after therapy, all severe AEs (SAEs)
were recorded. All patients who did not attend follow-up

(HIV); Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC); Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI); National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN); overall survival (OS); partial
remission (PR); photodynamic therapy (PDT); plateletderived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β); progressionfree survival (PFS); Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST); rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma
(RAF); severe AEs (SAEs); stable disease (SD); standard
deviation (SD); time to progression (TTP); transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE); vascular endothelial growth

Primary and secondary endpoints
The primary endpoint was DCR at week 12. Disease
control was defined as the proportion of patients who had
no disease progression (i.e., those with a CR, PR, or SD
as determined by the RECIST 1.1 criteria), and who still
received sorafenib therapy. Thus, DCR was calculated
as the rate of patients with CR/PR/SD who still received
sorafenib over the whole evaluated patient population. The
derived DCR was determined as follows: (1) if PD was
not achieved within 12 weeks and there was no evaluation
at week 12, the latest results of evaluation after 12 weeks
were moved forward to week 12; (2) if patients died within
12 weeks and there was no evaluation at week 12, the
outcome at week 12 was defined as PD; (3)	 if PD was
achieved within 12 weeks and there was no evaluation at
week 12, the outcome at week 12 was defined as PD; and
(4) if PD was noted at the second evaluation (week 6) and
there was no evaluation thereafter, the outcome at week 12
was defined as PD.
In addition, the following secondary endpoints were
determined: TTP which was defined as the time interval
from initiation of sorafenib to disease progression as
determined by imaging examinations; PFS which was
defined as the time interval from initiation of sorafenib
to disease progression as determined by imaging
examinations or death; OS which was defined as the time
interval from initiation of sorafenib to death due to any
cause; DOT; and safety.

Statistical analysis
Patients’ demographic, clinical data, therapy/
intervention and outcomes were summarized as mean±
standard deviation (SD) for continuous data with normal
distributions, median (IQR: 1st and 3rd quartiles) for those
without normal distribution, and n (%) for categorical
data. The OS, TTP and PFS were analyzed and represented
using the Kaplan-Meier curves. All analyses were
performed using the SPSS Medical Pack for Windows
(version 11.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A p < 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.
