Abstract
The investigation of metal-based complexes with potential
antitumor activity has been of paramount importance in
recent years due to the successful use of cisplatin against
various cancers. Gallium(III) and subsequently developed
gallium(III)-containing complexes have shown promising
antineoplastic effects when tested in a host of malignancies,
specifically in lymphomas and bladder cancer. However, the
molecular mechanism responsible for their anticancer effect
is yet to be fully understood. We report here for the first
time that the proteasome is a molecular target for gallium
complexes in a variety of prostate cancer cell lines and in
human prostate cancer xenografts. We tested five gallium
complexes (1–5) in which the gallium ion is bound to an NN¶O
asymmetrical ligand containing pyridine and substituted
phenolate moieties in a 1:2 (M/L) ratio. We found that
complex 5 showed superior proteasome inhibitory activity
against both 26S proteasome (IC50, 17 Mmol/L) and purified
20S (IC50, 16 Mmol/L) proteasome. Consistently, this effect
was associated with apoptosis induction in prostate cancer
cells. Additionally, complex 5 was able to exert the same effect
in vivo by inhibiting growth of PC-3 xenografts in mice (66%),
which was associated with proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction. Our results strongly suggest that gallium
complexes, acting as potent proteasome inhibitors, have a
great potential to be developed into novel anticancer drugs.

Introduction
Since the approval of cisplatin nearly 30 years ago, renewed
efforts have focused on developing metal-based chemotherapeutic
agents with improved clinical efficacy and reduced overall toxicity
(1). Gallium is a naturally occurring metal that has been investigated in clinical trials against a number of malignancies including
lymphomas and bladder cancer (2–6). It has also shown efficacy
against a diverse set of disorders such as accelerated bone resorption and autoimmune and infectious diseases (2). Gallium is
currently approved for the treatment of hypercalcemia associated
with malignancy (7–9). Besides its therapeutic utility, for over a half
century, Ga67 has been used as a diagnostic agent for cancer (5, 10).

The therapeutic efficacy of gallium is associated with the ability
of gallium(III) to disrupt normal cellular iron homeostasis by
competing against Fe3+ from circulation for cellular uptake (11, 12).
This uptake is mediated by the transferrin receptor system,
ubiquitously expressed on normal dividing cells and overexpressed on malignant cells (11, 13). Overexpression of transferrin
receptor illustrates the increased iron requirement for highly
proliferating tumor cells and serves as an attractive possible
target for gallium-based therapeutics (11, 13). Recent studies have
shown gallium-mediated induction of apoptosis, accompanied
with increased levels of Bax and cytochrome c as well as caspase
activation (14–16).
To stabilize the gallium(III) and facilitate its cellular uptake,
many gallium complexes have recently been investigated (5, 10, 17).
Some of them have shown clinical significance by providing
gallium(III) in a more readily available form with positive
pharmacokinetic parameters (10, 17–19).
The degradation of proteins mediated by the ubiquitin/
proteosome pathway is critical for maintaining intracellular
homeostasis (20, 21). Proteins targeted for the proteasomal
degradation are tagged with ubiquitin molecules and escorted to
the 26S proteasome (21, 22). The 20S proteasome serves as a
multicatalytic protease of the 26S proteasome and is responsible
for at least three critical enzymatic activities: chymotrypsin-like,
trypsin-like, and caspase-like (23). Because proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity inhibition is associated with apoptosis
induction in tumor cells (24, 25), the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway became an attractive target in anticancer drug development. In 2003, bortezomib became the first proteasome inhibitor
approved by Food and Drug Administration as an anticancer drug
(26, 27).
Based on positive clinical data using gallium as an antitumor
agent, we investigated further targets responsible for its biological
effects. In the current study, we tested five gallium complexes with
empirical formula [GaIII(LX)2], where (LX) is a negatively charged
ligand containing 2-methyl-pyridine and 2-methyl-phenolate
groups attached to a secondary amine. The phenolate moiety has
substituents X = methoxide (complex 1), nitro (complex 2), chloro
(complex 3), bromo (complex 4), and iodo (complex 5) in the 2nd
and 6th positions of the ring (Fig. 1A). These species have a wellestablished cell killing activity against cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cells (28). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for their anticancer effect has not been fully understood. Here,
we show for the first time that synthetic gallium complexes,
especially 5, 4, and 3, are able to target and inhibit proteasomal
activity and induce apoptosis in various prostate cancer cell lines.
The ability to inhibit proteasome activity was indicated by the
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the proteasomal target
protein p27. The proteasome inhibitory potency of complex 5 was
shown both in in vitro studies and in a human prostate tumor

xenograft model. In contrast, complexes 1 and 2 or gallium salt
alone was unable to sustain these effects under the same in vitro
conditions. Our results show a novel approach to use gallium
complexes as proteasome inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in
prostate cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The gallium complexes 1 to 5 were synthesized as previously
described (28). Hoechst 33258 and cremophor were purchased from SigmaAldrich. Purified rabbit 20S proteasome and fluorogenic peptide substrates
Suc-LLVY-AMC and Ac-DEVD-AMC were obtained from Calbiochem, Inc.
Peptide substrate Z-GGL-AMC was from BIOMOL International LP.
Apoptag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit was from Chemicon
International, Inc.
Cell cultures and whole-cell extract preparation. Human prostate
cancer cells, LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC-3, were grown in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37jC and
5% CO2. A whole-cell extract was prepared as previously described (25, 29).
Inhibition of purified 20S proteasome activity. Purified rabbit 20S
proteasome (17.5 ng) was incubated in 100 AL of assay buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with gallium complexes and 10 Amol/L fluorogenic peptide
substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC for 2 h at 37jC. After incubation, production of
hydrolyzed AMC groups was measured as previously described (30).
Inhibition of the proteasome activity in intact cells. C4-2B cells were
cultured in a 96-well plate (1  104 per well) and treated with various
concentrations of gallium complexes for 18 h. After an additional 2-h
incubation with the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-GGL-AMC, which is
specific for the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity, production of
hydrolyzed AMC groups was measured as described above.

Caspase-3 and proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity assays. Proteins
extracted from cells or tumor tissue were incubated for 1 h at 37jC in 100 AL
of assay buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 10 Amol/L of fluorogenic
substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC ( for chymotrypsin-like activity in cultured cells),
Z-GGL-AMC ( for chymotrypsin-like activity in tumor tissues), or Ac-DEVDAMC ( for caspase-3/caspase-7 activity) as previously described (31).
Cellular and nuclear morphology analysis. A Zeiss Axiovert 25
microscope was used for all microscopic imagings, either with phase
contrast for cellular morphology or with fluorescence for nuclear
morphology with Hoechst 33258 staining as previously described (31).
Western blot analysis. The cell or tissue extracts were separated by
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot
analysis was done with specific antibodies against ubiquitin, p27, androgen
receptor, h-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP; BIOMOL International), followed by visualization using
the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences).
Human prostate tumor xenograft experiments. Five-week-old male
athymic nude mice were purchased from Taconic Research Animal Services
and housed under pathogen-free conditions according to Wayne State
University animal care guidelines. The protocols of animal experiments
were reviewed and approved by Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and
Use Committee of Wayne State University. PC-3 cells (2  106) were injected
s.c. at one flank of the mice. The mice were then randomly grouped and
injected s.c. daily with solvent (PBS/cremophor/ethanol/DMSO = 5:2.7:1.3:1)
as a control (n = 9), 20 mg/kg of complex 5 (n = 9), or 20 mg/kg of ligand 5
(L5; n = 5) for 29 days. Tumor size was measured every other day using
calipers. Tumor volume (V ) was determined by the equation V = (L  W 2)
 0.5, where L is the length and W is the width of the tumor.

in situ apoptosis detection kit and immunostaining of p27 were done as
previously described (29). H&E staining in tumor tissues was done following
manufactory protocols (29). Briefly, paraffin-embedded sample slides were
deparaffinized and hydrated and then stained with hematoxylin for 1 min.
After rinsing, the slides were stained with eosin for 1 min, rinsed, and
coverslips were mounted onto slides with Permount.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done with Microsoft Excel
software. Student’s t test for independent analysis was applied to evaluate
differences between treatments and control.

Results
Structural relationships of several synthetic gallium complexes with their activities to inhibit purified 20S proteasome
and cellular 26S proteasome. We have previously reported that
certain copper complexes are potent proteasome inhibitors (29,
30, 32). We hypothesized that gallium complexes might be similarly
capable of targeting and inhibiting the proteasome in human
tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed proteasome
inhibitory potencies of five gallium complexes (Fig. 1A) under cellfree conditions and found that complexes 3, 4, and 5 inhibited
chymotrypsin-like activity of the purified 20S proteasome with IC50
values of 46, 27, and 16 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1B). In contrast,
complex 2 showed very weak inhibitory potential, whereas complex
1 had no effect at the highest concentration used (50 Amol/L;
Fig. 1B). The rank of the inhibitory potencies of the gallium
complexes against the purified 20S proteasome is 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 z 1.
To determine the potencies of these complexes to inhibit
chymotrypsin-like activity in intact cells, androgen-independent
human prostate cancer C4-2B cells (33) were plated into a 96-well
plate and treated with each of the five complexes for 18 h, followed
by measurement of proteasome activity. We found that the IC50
values of complexes 3, 4, and 5 in intact C4-2B cells were 48, 28, and
17 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1C), consistent with their inhibitory
potencies against the purified 20S proteasome. Complexes 1 and 2
again showed only slight inhibitory effect (Fig. 1C).
Inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity by
gallium complexes in androgen-independent human C4-2B
prostate cancer cells is associated with down-regulation of
androgen receptor and induction of apoptosis. To confirm the
ability of these gallium complexes to inhibit the proteasomal
activity in prostate cancer cells, C4-2B cells were treated with each
complex at 50 Amol/L concentrations for 18 h. The cells were
harvested and used for cell extract preparation, followed by
measurement of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity and
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Complexes 1 to 5 were
found to inhibit 7.5%, 14%, 38%, 58%, and 81% of the proteasomal
activity, respectively (Fig. 2A, left). Additionally, high levels of
accumulated ubiquitinated proteins were detected in C4-2B cells
treated with complexes 3, 4, and 5 (Fig. 2B, left).
It has been shown that proteasome inhibition could downregulate androgen receptor expression (34). Therefore, if gallium
complexes were able to inhibit proteasomal activity, we would
expect a decrease in androgen receptor expression level. Indeed,
the results in Fig. 2B showed that gallium complexes 2 and 3, but
not complex 1, down-regulated androgen receptor protein (3 >
2 > 1), whereas complexes 4 and 5 completely abrogated androgen
receptor protein expression (Fig. 2B, left). These results remained
consistent with the order of proteasome inhibitory potency of the
gallium complexes.
It has also been shown that inhibition of the proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like activity in malignant cells could result in the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

induction of apoptosis (24, 25). To investigate whether the
proteasomal inhibition and androgen receptor level reduction by
gallium complexes are associated with apoptotic cell death, PARP
cleavage and morphologic and nuclear changes were measured in
the same experiment. The results showed that treatment with
gallium complexes 3, 4, and 5 caused apoptosis-specific PARP
cleavage (Fig. 2B, left), whereas complexes 1 and 2 failed to do so
(Fig. 2B). Consistently, morphologic changes (shrunken cells and
characteristic apoptotic blobbing; Fig. 2C, top) and the presence of
apoptotic nuclei after Hoechst staining (condensed or punctuated
and brighter nuclei; Fig. 2C, bottom) were observed in the cells treated
for 18 h with complexes 4 and 5. Whereas complex 3 induced only
moderate level of apoptotic cellular and nuclear changes (Fig. 2C),
complexes 1 and 2 showed some to no activity (Fig. 2C). These results
show that the induction of apoptosis in C4-2B cells by gallium
complexes is associated with the inhibition of the proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like activity, and that the apoptosis-inducing potency
of these compounds was also ranked as 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 z 1.
To investigate the effects of different concentrations of gallium
complexes on prostate cancer cells, we selected the most potent
complex 5 and treated C4-2B cells at various concentrations (10, 25,
and 50 Amol/L), followed by measurement of proteasome
inhibition, androgen receptor protein level, and apoptosis induction. The results showed that complex 5 inhibited the proteasome
in a dose-dependent manner as measured by proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like activity (Fig. 3A) and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome target protein p27 (ref. 35; Fig. 3B).
Decrease in androgen receptor level and apoptosis-specific PARP
cleavage were also induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).
Inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity by
gallium complexes in androgen-dependent human LNCaP
prostate cancer cells is associated with down-regulation of
androgen receptor and induction of apoptosis. After we showed
the ability of the gallium complexes to inhibit proteasome activity
and induce apoptosis in androgen-independent C4-2B prostate
cancer cells, we tested the effect of the same gallium complexes on
the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line (33). LNCaP cells were
treated with 50 Amol/L concentration of each complex for 18 h,
followed by measurement of the proteasome activity, androgen
receptor protein level, and apoptosis induction. We found that
gallium complexes 2, 3, 4, and 5 inhibited chymotrypsin-like
activity of the proteasome by 12%, 39%, 62%, and 79%, respectively
(Fig. 2A, right), whereas complex 1 showed only a slight effect
compared with solvent control (Fig. 2A, right). Consistent with the
inhibition of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity, significantly increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins were detected in
LNCaP cells treated with complexes 3 to and 5 (Fig. 2B, right).
Complex 5 was also found to be most potent in decreasing
androgen receptor level, whereas complex 1 had almost no effect
(Fig. 2B, right). In the same experiment, treatment with gallium
complexes 3, 4, and 5 resulted in massive cell detachment (data not
shown) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B, right). Additionally, complexes
3 to 5 induced caspase-3/caspase-7 in a time-dependent manner
(data not shown), whereas complexes 1 and 2 showed only a slight
effect. These results show that in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells,
these gallium complexes have the same rank of proteasome
inhibitory, androgen receptor–suppressing, and apoptosis-inducing
potencies as in androgen-independent C4-2B cells.

of all tested complexes, had superior proteasome inhibitory and
apoptosis-inducing abilities in androgen receptor–dependent prostate cancer C4-2B and LNCaP cells (Figs. 1–3). To study the effect of
these compounds in androgen receptor–independent prostate
cancer cells, PC-3 cells were treated with 50 Amol/L of complex 5
for various time points (0.5–12 h). The proteasomal chymotrypsinlike activity was found to be inhibited by 17% after the first 30 min of
treatment (Fig. 4A), which was associated with accumulated level of
ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 4B). The proteasome inhibition and
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were observed during
the course of treatment (Fig. 4A and B). Accumulation of p27 was
also found to be time dependent (Fig. 4B). Importantly, apoptosisspecific PARP cleavage was not observed until 4 h of treatment
(Fig. 4B). These results clearly show that the apoptosis induced by
complex 5 occurs after the proteasome inhibition. Therefore,
proteasome inhibition seems to be required for apoptosis induction
by gallium complexes.

cultured human prostate cancer cells and that complex 5 is the
most potent (Figs. 1–4). To investigate whether compound 5 could
also inhibit the proteasome and induce apoptosis in vivo, we used
mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts. PC-3 cells were
implanted s.c. into male nude mice and allowed to grow until the
appearance of a palpable tumor (f120 mm3). The mice were then
randomly grouped and injected s.c. daily with solvent, 20 mg/kg
complex 5, or 20 mg/kg L5 for 29 days. At the end of the trial, the
mice were sacrificed and tumor tissues were harvested and used
for multiple assays. Measurement of tumor size showed that tumor
growth was inhibited by 66% in complex 5–treated mice and by
only 30% in L5-treated mice, compared with the control mice
(Fig. 5A). Therefore, complex 5 possesses potent antitumor
property in vivo. However, antitumor activity of L5 was also
observed (see below).
To determine if the observed antitumor effects of complex 5 and
L5 are associated with proteasome inhibitory and apoptosisinducing activities in vivo, the prepared tissue samples were used
for several assays. Figure 5B shows inhibition of the proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like activity by 65% in complex 5–treated tumors,
compared with the control, whereas L5-treated tumors showed

only 31% inhibition. Consistently, accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins and p27 was found in tumors treated with complex 5, as
measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C). L5-treated tumors
were also able to accumulate ubiquitinated proteins and p27, but
to a lesser extent (Fig. 5C). This suggests the possibility of L5
combining with endogenous metal species, such as copper, which
forms partial proteasome-inhibiting complexes (see Discussion).
Increased accumulation of p27 protein in tumors treated by
complex 5 or L5 was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry
assay, which showed the increase of p27-positive cells by 64%, 25%,
and 7% in tumors treated with complex 5, L5, or solvent,
respectively (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of the proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like activity in tumors treated with complex 5 or L5
was associated with apoptosis, as shown by induction of caspase-3/
caspase-7 activity (Fig. 5D) and the appearance of cleaved PARP
fragment (Fig. 5C). Induction of apoptosis in tumors treated with
complex 5 or L5 was further confirmed by the presence of TUNEL-

positive cells (78% and 19% in complex 5– and L5-treated tumors,
respectively; Fig. 6B) and high levels of condensed apoptotic nuclei
detected by H&E staining (76% and 23% in complex 5– and L5treated tumors, respectively; Fig. 6C). Whereas L5 alone was able to
induce some level of apoptosis, complex 5 was much more potent,
showing superior tumor growth inhibition. We monitored the body
weight of mice from each group and the average readings were
25.9, 25.7, and 25.5 g from the mice treated with the solvent, L5, and
complex 5, respectively. The data of the body weight showed that
there was no toxicity of L5 and complex 5 observed in the treated
mice. Taken together, these results clearly show that complex 5 was
able to target the proteasome in vivo, resulting in induction of
apoptotic cell death.

The main problems with conventional metal-based chemotherapeutic strategies are nonspecific interactions and the

development of copper-based compounds as antitumor agents
have shown promising preclinical results, thereby highlighting a

potential novel therapeutic strategy (29, 36). Gallium complexes
have been investigated in clinical trials and ongoing studies are
trying to optimize drug disposition and pharmacokinetic
parameters (1, 10, 17).
The established antitumor activity and therapeutic potential of
gallium complexes have renewed our interest in exploring their
mechanisms of action (1, 5, 10). Although many studies are
investigating biological effects of gallium, they are mainly focused
on a transferrin-mediated mode of action, with subsequent
inhibition of DNA synthesis (1, 5, 11). Some studies with gallium
have been implicated in the programmed cell death pathway
concomitant with iron deficiency and sustained gallium exposure
(3, 15). However, the mechanism of action triggered by gallium
complexes remained mainly unclear.
Because gallium complexes showed inhibition of cell proliferation against cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cells (28), we
decided to further investigate their biological activities against
prostate cancer cells and tumors. We show here that some of these
gallium complexes are very potent apoptosis inducers in androgendependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
Moreover, we reveal the 26S proteasome as their target, which

represents an important step in delineating their mechanism of
action.
The gallium complexes investigated here were synthesized by
using asymmetrical ligands containing pyridine and 2,6-substituted
phenol moieties (Fig. 1A). Whereas their cell killing activities have
been well established, their coordination mode and structureactivity relationship are not well understood. In the current study,
we have found that complex 5 is much more potent than complexes
1 to 4, suggesting that L5 possesses certain characteristics that, after
coordination with gallium, provide an optimal biological response.
This optimal response may be governed by the strong k electron–
donating iodine group. Considering that all ligands used to
synthesize complexes 3 to 5 contain electron-withdrawing halogen
substituents, only their k-donating ability could relate to their
antitumor effects (I > Br > Cl). Iodine retains very weak electronwithdrawing ability but is a very strong k-donating group, which
can activate the ring system of the gallium complex and influence
its ability to bind the proteasome. However, the influence of the
coordination mode of the metal ion and phenol substitute group on
its therapeutic effect is purely speculative at this point. We also
showed that L5 is able to bind other metals, such as copper, and

Figure 6. Immunohistochemistry p27,
TUNEL, and H&E staining assays using
mouse tumor samples. Tumors were
collected after 29-d treatment (see Fig. 5
legend), and the prepared tissue slides
were used for p27 immunostaining (A ),
TUNEL (B ), and H&E staining (C ) assays.
Stronger or/and more p27-positive cells
and TUNEL-positive nuclei as well as
apoptotic-condensed nuclei were found in
tumor tissues from mice treated with
complex 5. L5 has similar, but weaker,
effects. Magnifications, 100 and 400.

that L5 mixed with copper potently inhibited the proteasome and
induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells (data not shown).
It has been reported that tumor tissue contains an elevated level
of copper (37, 38). Therefore, one possible explanation for some
tumor growth inhibition observed in the mice treated with L5
could be an effect of complex made between L5 and copper.
We also found that the gallium(III) chloride was relatively
nontoxic and that concomitant treatment with complex 5 and
iron(III) chloride partially precluded the cytotoxic effect of complex
5 (data not shown). Therefore, we propose that gallium complexes,
rather than gallium ions sequestered from the complex, are taken
up through the transferrin receptor–mediated pathway. However,
the exact mechanism for uptake of gallium complexes and their
intracellular trafficking and binding to the proteasome need to be
further investigated.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

The most important aspects in our study were to investigate
whether these gallium complexes were active in vivo and to verify
their molecular target(s). Therefore, we tested the effects of
complex 5, the most potent gallium complex, and its ligand, L5,
in mice bearing human PC-3 xenografts. Our data showed that
treatment with complex 5 caused a significant inhibition of PC-3
tumor growth in nude mice (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the antitumor
activity of complex 5 was associated with the proteasomal activity
inhibition (Fig. 5B), accumulation of the proteasome target
proteins p27 (Figs. 5C and 6A), and induction of apoptosis, shown
by caspase-3/caspase-7 activation, PARP cleavage, TUNEL positivity, and nuclei condensation (Figs. 5 and 6). Taken together, our
current study strongly suggests that gallium complexes, by acting
as potent proteasome inhibitors, have great potential to be
developed as novel anticancer drugs.
