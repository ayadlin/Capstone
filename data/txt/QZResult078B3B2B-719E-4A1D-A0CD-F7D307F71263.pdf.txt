Abstract
PR-104, currently in phase II clinical trials, is a phosphate ester pre-prodrug which is converted in vivo to its
cognate alcohol, PR-104A, a prodrug designed to exploit tumor hypoxia. Bioactivation occurs via one-electron
reduction to DNA crosslinking metabolites in the absence of oxygen. However, certain tumor cell lines activate PR-104A in the presence of oxygen, suggesting the existence of an aerobic nitroreductase. Microarray
analysis identified a cluster of five aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family members whose expressions correlated
with aerobic metabolism of PR-104A. Plasmid-based expression of candidate genes identified aldo-keto reductase 1C3 as a novel nitroreductase. AKR1C3 protein was detected by Western blot in 7 of 23 cell lines and
correlated with oxic PR-104A metabolism, an activity which could be partially suppressed by Nrf2 RNAi
knockdown (or induced by Keap1 RNAi), indicating regulation by the ARE pathway. AKR1C3 was unable
to sensitize cells to 10 other bioreductive prodrugs and was associated with single-agent PR-104 activity
across a panel of 9 human tumor xenograft models. Overexpression in two AKR1C3-negative tumor xenograft
models strongly enhanced PR-104 antitumor activity. A population level survey of AKR1C3 expression in 2,490
individual cases across 19 cancer types using tissue microarrays revealed marked upregulation of AKR1C3 in a
subset including hepatocellular, bladder, renal, gastric, and non–small cell lung carcinoma. A survey of normal
tissue AKR1C3 expression suggests the potential for tumor-selective PR-104A activation by this mechanism.
These findings have significant implications for the clinical development of PR-104. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1573–84.

Introduction
Bioreductive prodrugs are designed to provide targeted
release of toxins in tumors. Enzymatic addition of one (1e−)
or two (2e−) electrons initiates the formation of DNA reactive
species. 2e− reduction of quinone-based prodrugs (e.g., mitomycin C, apaziquone) could provide tumor selectivity because
of the elevated expression of enzymes such as NAD(P)H:
quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) in some tumors (1). Nitroheterocyclic compounds are rarely substrates for 2e− reduction,
with the notable exception of tretazicar (CB 1954), an aziridi-

nyl dinitrobenzamide substrate for both NQO1 and NQO2 (2).
More typically, nitroreduction in human tissues occurs via 1e−
addition in a process that can be inhibited by molecular oxygen. This redox relationship serves to restrict net metabolism to hypoxic cells which, together with the absence of
oxygen-insensitive (2e−) nitroreduction, underlies the utility
of nitro compounds as hypoxia imaging agents (e.g., PIMO,
F-MISO, EF5, and FAZA; ref. 3) and as hypoxic cytotoxins
(e.g., CI-1010, PR-104, TH-302, NLCQ-1, and KS119W; ref. 4).
Clinical development of this class of agents reflects the prevalence of hypoxia in solid tumors, the recognition of its negative effect on treatment outcome and the strong associations
with malignant progression (5, 6).
PR-104 is a water-soluble phosphate ester that is hydrolyzed rapidly in vivo to the corresponding alcohol PR-104A,
a bioreductive prodrug (7). PR-104A is a dinitrobenzamide
mustard that undergoes nitro reduction to hydroxylamine
PR-104H and amine PR-104M, which are DNA cross-linking
metabolites able to diffuse locally and kill neighboring cells.
Cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is an important 1e− oxidoreductase that accounts for the majority (∼60%) of anaerobic
PR-104A activation in anoxic SiHa cells in vitro (8). Backoxidation of the initial nitro radical is an efficient process,
with 50% inhibition by as little as 0.1 μmol/L of oxygen (9).
Consistent with this oxygen-sensitive mechanism, PR-104A
is 5 to 120 times more cytotoxic under anoxia for all neoplastic

cell lines tested and PR-104 has striking antitumor activity in
human tumor xenograft models when combined with anticancer agents that spare hypoxic cells (7). These properties have
led to the clinical evaluation of PR-104 (10).
Despite clear evidence for hypoxia-selective activation, the
oxygen concentration dependence of PR-104A cytotoxicity in
SiHa cultures shows an asymptote at high oxygen levels (9),
consistent with a residual oxygen-independent mechanism,
with metabolism (8) and DNA crosslinking (11), being due
to aerobic bioreduction to PR-104H/M, as for the hypoxic
mechanism. In addition, xenograft growth inhibition following single-agent PR-104 treatment seems to track with aerobic sensitivity of the corresponding cell lines in vitro (7).
Taken together, these observations suggest the existence of
an oxygen-independent 2e− metabolic pathway.
In a previous study we tested whether NQO1 might be responsible for this aerobic activation of PR-104A. Cellular
sensitivity to PR-104A weakly correlated with NQO1 enzymatic activity in a panel of eight cell lines, but overexpression
of the enzyme showed that NQO1 itself is not a PR-104A reductase (8). This led us to suggest that NQO1 is coordinately
regulated with an unknown oxidoreductase responsible for
2e− reduction of PR-104A. Given the NQO1 gene is regulated
by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2; refs. 12,
13), other 2e− oxidoreductases regulated by the Keap1Nrf2-ARE antioxidant response pathway would be likely
candidates.
Here, we identify candidate aerobic PR-104A reductases by
correlating gene expression with aerobic PR-104A reduction.
By expressing the most highly correlated of these genes
in HCT116 cells, we show that the PR-104A reductase is
aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3), a ketosteroid reductase
(14) not previously described as a nitroreductase. We confirm
that AKR1C3 is a bona fide oxygen-insensitive PR-104A reductase using purified enzyme, that it does not activate other
bioreductive prodrugs, and that it contributes to the activity
of PR-104 in human tumor xenografts. In a tissue microarray
(TMA) survey of AKR1C3 expression in surgical samples,
we show that AKR1C3 is highly expressed in some human
tumors.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. PR-104 was supplied by Proacta, Inc. PR104A, PR-104H, and tetradeuterated derivatives were synthesized, purified, and stored as described previously (15, 16).
Sources of other compounds are in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell lines, cytotoxicity assays, and PR-104A metabolism.
Cells were maintained in culture as described (7, 17) with
<6 mo cumulative passage from sources (see Supplementary
Table S2). Antiproliferative and clonogenic survival assays
were performed as previously described (7, 17) and measurement of metabolism of PR-104A to hydroxylamine PR-104H
and amine PR-104M by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as before (11).
RNA expression microarray and data analysis. Microarray-based RNA expression profiles covering 38,500 probes
(Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0) were obtained for cultures of

1574

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

23 human tumor cell lines. RNA was purified using Trizolchloroform extraction (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns
(Qiagen). Both RNA purification and Affymetrix array analysis were conducted according to the manufacturers'
instructions. The raw data are available from ArrayExpress.6
Using the “GO” and “hgu133plus2” packages from Bioconductor (18), we searched for all descendants of the node
GO:0016491 (oxidoreductase activity) to obtain a list of
probes corresponding to 370 oxidoreductase gene products
which were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering.
To identify candidate PR-104A reductases, we calculated the
correlation coefficient (Kendall τ) between gene expression
and aerobic PR-104A metabolism (to PR-104H/M) across all
probe sets; correlation P values were adjusted using the false
discovery rate correction (Limma's empirical Bayes adjusted;
ref. 19) for multiple comparisons.
Candidate gene expression. Plasmids encoding sequenceconfirmed open reading frames for AKR 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2,
1C3, 1C4, and NQO1 were purchased (Supplementary
Table S3) and cloned into the Gateway compatible vector
F527-V5, constructed from pcDNA6.2V5DEST (Invitrogen)
and a modified version of the pEFIRES-P plasmid (20).
F527-V5 provides the transcription of a bicistronic mRNA
which encodes the oxidoreductase and pac (puromycin resistance) open reading frames, the former harboring an occult
COOH-terminal V5-tag inducible by infection with AdV5 expressing a TAG suppressor tRNA (Tag-on-Demand, Invitrogen). HCT116 and H1299 cells were transfected using
Fugene6 and pooled stable populations selected with puromycin as previously described (21). Functional activity of
clones was established by incubating cells with the fluorogenic AKR1C probe coumberone (ref. 22; 5 μmol/L, 37°C,
3 h) using a fluorescent platereader (Molecular Devices
SpectraMax M2; Ex/Em 385/510 nm) and standard curves of
authentic reduced coumberone.
Western immunoblot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and 10 to 20 μg of
protein was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels (4–12% gradient gels
or 12% gels), transferred, blocked and probed with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table S4) and detected
using chemiluminescent ECL detection (Supersignal,
Thermoscientific).
RNAi knockdown of Nrf2 and Keap1 mRNA. Stealth short
interfering RNA (siRNA; Invitrogen) against Nrf2 (HSS107128)
were tested in A549 and H460, or against Keap1 (HSS114801)
in HCT116 and MDA231 cells. Cells (106/10 cm dish) were
transfected with 10 nmol/L of siRNA and LipofectAMINE
RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen), harvested 72 h
later by trypsinization, and immunoblotted and assayed for
PR-104A metabolites as above.
Kinetics of PR-104A reduction by recombinant AKR1C3.
Recombinant AKR1C3 was diluted to 2 μmol/L in potassium
phosphate buffer [100 mmol/L (pH 7.4), 37°C] containing
NADPH (100 μmol/L), bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/mL),

and PR-104A (0–150 μmol/L). Reactions (400 μL) were
monitored by absorbance (340 nm, Agilent 8453E diode array
spectrophotometer) and initial rates determined. Products
were analyzed with an Agilent LC/MS (7), following incubation for 10 min in the same (aerobic) reaction mix or under
anoxic conditions (Coy anaerobic chamber).
Antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts. Animal
studies were approved by the University of Auckland Animal
Ethics Committee and international guidelines were followed. Tumors were grown subcutaneously in the flank of
female NIH-III or CD1 nude mice (Charles River Laboratories) by inoculating 5 × 106 cells in 100 μL αMEM. To evaluate clonogenic survival, tumors (800–1500 mm 3 ) were
dissected 24 h after single dose PR-104 and plated as described (7). Tumor growth delay experiments were undertaken as described previously (7). Median time for tumors
to increase in volume 4-fold (RTV4) was determined, and
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated as the percentage of increase in RTV4 for treated over control (statistical difference tested by Mann-Whitney U test using
SigmaStat v3.5).
Immunostaining for AKR1C3 and hypoxia in xenografts.
Formalin-fixed tumors were sectioned (5 μm) and immunostained using anti-AKR1C3 monoclonal antibody (ref. 23;
Sigma) and visualized with the EnVision Dual Link-HRP/
DAB kit (Dako). For detection of hypoxia, mice were dosed
i.p. with 60 mg/kg of pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe-1 kit;
Chemicon Int) 90 min before removing tumors. To determine
the pimonidazole adducts, half of each tumor was formalinfixed for immunofluorescence microscopy and the other half
dissociated enzymatically for flow cytometry according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
AKR1C3 expression in human tumor TMA. TMAs were
sourced as shown in Supplementary Table S5. A total of
3,932 individual cores representing 19 cancer types (2,490
cases) were analyzed across 38 TMAs with an average of
207 cores per disease (median, 174; range, 31–452). Methodology optimization was carried out and cross-validated
against paired frozen samples by Western blot. Slides were
immunostained for AKR1C3 as for tumor xenografts and
cores were scored for staining intensity and proportion of
AKR1C3-positive neoplastic cells by a certified pathologist
(S.B. Fox) using a semiquantitative measure on a 7-point
scale ranging from negative (score 0) to diffuse strong staining (score 6). This measure was applied to the neoplastic cell
element of the tumors within the TMAs and the epithelial
elements within the normal TMA. An unrelated series of normal tissue, NSCLC and breast cancer sections were evaluated
independently by Mosaic Laboratories, LLC.

Results
PR-104A is activated by an oxygen-independent process
in a subset of cultured cell lines. As reported previously for
SiHa cells (8), the flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenyliodonium
prevented the anoxic cytotoxicity of PR-104A in A549 cells
(Fig. 1A). However, it had no effect on the aerobic cytotoxicity of PR-104A. In contrast, ketoconazole (identified from a

www.aacrjournals.org

chemical inhibitor screen; Supplementary Fig. S1), blocked
aerobic but not anoxic cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A), suggesting that
different enzymes mediate the activation of PR-104A under
these two conditions. To distinguish metabolism-dependent
from intrinsic cell sensitivity, inhibition of aerobic cell
proliferation by PR-104A and its cytotoxic metabolite PR104H were compared across 12 cell lines (Fig. 1B). A consistent ∼20-fold PR-104 A/H deactivation ratio was found for
seven cell lines (r2 = 0.96), whereas in five cell lines (A549,
H460, SiHa, 22Rv1, and HT29) PR-104A showed anomalously
high toxicity. Notably, these five cell lines were recently
shown to have high rates of aerobic reduction of PR-104A
(11). Taken together, these results suggest variable expression of an aerobic PR-104A reductase in human tumor
cell lines.
Aerobic PR-104A metabolism correlates with AKR family
regulation. To identify candidate PR-104A oxidoreductases,
we examined gene expression by microarray profiling and
compared these data with aerobic reduction of PR-104A
to PR-104H/M, adding a further 11 cell lines to the above
12 cell line panels to increase statistical power. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of oxidoreductase gene expression
identified two distinct groups, defined largely by members
of the AKR superfamily and other Keap1/Nrf2/ARE regulated
genes such as NQO1 (“Nrf2 cluster”; Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3). Using an LC/MS/MS assay to quantify PR104A reduction (Fig. 1D) we showed large differences between the same cell lines (160-fold range) with the fast
metabolizers associated with the “Nrf2 cluster.” A principal
component analysis, accounting for false discovery (adjusted
P value < 0.1), identified 20 probes positively correlated
with PR-104H/M formation (Supplementary Table S6), 8 of
which corresponded to five members of the AKR family
(1C1, 1C2, 1C3, 1C4, and 1B10).
Aerobic PR-104A nitroreduction is mediated by AKR1C3.
These five AKR1 candidates, along with AKR1B1 and
known aerobic nitroreductase, NQO1, were expressed by
plasmid transfer into HCT116 cells and stable populations
tested for aerobic PR-104A metabolism. Only AKR1C3
transfectants were able to generate PR-104H/M (Fig. 2A),
despite all the candidate reductases being immunodetected
following induced translation of a cryptic COOH-terminal
V5-tag (Fig. 2B). Expression of AKR1C3, AKR1B10, and
NQO1 was confirmed independently using monoclonal
antibodies and an AKR1C1 polyclonal with cross-reactivity
for other AKR1C family members (Fig. 2B; antibody details
Supplementary Table S4). All AKR1C family transfectants
reduced the fluorogenic substrate coumberone (22),
confirming the functional expression of these enzymes
(Fig. 2C). We next confirmed that AKR1C3 itself is a 2e−
PR-104A reductase by demonstrating that purified recombinant AKR1C3 catalyses NADPH-dependent formation of
PR-104H in the presence or absence of oxygen (Fig. 2D).
The reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 20.6 ± 2.6 μmol/L and Kcat of 0.800 ± 0.025 min−1
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Evaluation of AKR1C3 expression in the 23 cell line panel

versus AKR1C3/actin (from Fig. 3A) showed a highly
significant correlation (r2 = 0.83; P < 0.001), which was stronger than the correlations with AKR1B10/actin (r2 = 0.27; P =
0.011) or NQO1/actin (r2 = 0.17; P = 0.053).
AKR1C3 expression is regulated in part by Nrf2. Given
the discordant relationship between NQO1 and AKR1C3
levels across the 23 cell line panel in vitro (r2 = 0.19), we evaluated the role of the Nrf2 in the expression of AKR1C3. RNA
interference of Keap1, a specific Nrf2 repressor, by siRNA
transfection in MDA231 cells induced AKR1C3 protein levels
5.7-fold (Fig. 3B) and aerobic PR-104A metabolism 7.0-fold
(Fig. 3B), with attendant 4.5-fold induction of an ARE-luciferase
reporter (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In analogous experiments,

ARE reporter activity (Supplementary Fig. S5B), AKR1C3 and
NQO1 expression, and aerobic PR-104A metabolism (Fig. 3B).
Similar results were obtained with H460 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5C). However, Keap1 siRNA increased NQO1 but not
AKR1C3 (or PR-104A reduction) in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5D). These results suggest a role for Nrf2 in induction
of AKR1C3 expression, but that additional cell line–specific factors result in differential regulation relative to NQO1.
AKR1C3 expression sensitizes cells to PR-104A but not to
other bioreductive drugs. To test whether AKR1C3 expression enhances the cytotoxicity of PR-104A, we isolated
two clones from the pool of HCT116 cells transfected with
AKR1C3. Clonogenic survival curves showed clone no. 1 to
be 10-fold more sensitive to PR-104A than the parental
cells under aerobic conditions, and was further sensitized
(44-fold) under anoxia (Fig. 3C). Using aerobic IC50 assays,

Aerobic Activation of PR-104A by AKR1C3

clonogenic assay 24 hours after single-dose PR-104 showed a
trend to greater activity in tumors with high AKR1C3 levels
(Mann-Whitney, P = 0.063; Fig. 4B). However, there was a
wide range of sensitivities among the AKR1C3-positive tumors, leading us to ask whether the extent of hypoxia also
influenced PR-104 sensitivity. Pimonidazole binding, as a
hypoxia marker, showed similar trends by flow cytometry
and immunostaining (Fig. 4C; see Supplementary Fig. S6
for a quantitative comparison of the two assays), but did
not correlate with the activity of PR-104. Indeed, some of
the least hypoxic tumors (H460 and SiHa) were the most sensitive to PR-104, whereas the most hypoxic (H1299 and
A2780) were relatively insensitive. However, these relationships may be confounded by cell line differences in intrinsic
sensitivity to the PR-104H/M active metabolites. To more

clearly identify the role of AKR1C3 in PR-104 monotherapy,
we compared xenografts grown from AKR1C3-overexpressing H1299 transfectants and parental cells by tumor growth
delay (Fig. 4D). Parental tumors showed modest growth inhibition (TGI, 77%; P = 0.03), possibly due to the hypoxic activation of PR-104 with attendant metabolite redistribution
(bystander effect). In contrast, AKR1C3-expressing H1299 xenografts regressed following PR-104 treatment with a TGI of
314% (P < 0.01; Fig. 4D). Hypoxic fraction was similar between these two models (Fig. 4D; data not shown); this establishes a major role for AKR1C3 expression in the response of
this NSCLC tumor model to PR-104. Similar experiments
with an isogenic pair of HCT116 xenografts differing in

AKR1C3 expression in human tumor surgical samples is
heterogeneous. AKR1C3 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using TMAs. A scoring system, illustrated
in Fig. 5A, gave higher ranking to uniform over focal
staining with scores of 4, 5, and 6 considered “positive.”
Expression of AKR1C3 was present in most tumor types
(Fig. 5B). HCC showed the highest frequency of positive
cores with most (58%) staining strongly in all cells (score 6).
Other disease types with >50% positive cores included bladder, renal, and gastric carcinomas. A summary of all scores

is shown in Supplementary Table S7. Examination of subtypes of lung carcinoma showed marked heterogeneity, with
expression restricted to NSCLC whereas small cell lung carcinoma was negative; expression was also present in a high
proportion (54%) of lung tumor metastases (Fig. 5C). To
confirm these TMA observations, a series of lung and breast
cancer tissue sections were analyzed by an independent
laboratory using a separate optimized staining protocol
and scoring criteria (see Supplementary Methods); 48%

AKR1C3 expression in normal tissues. A survey of 33 normal tissue TMA cores identified small intestine and kidney
as containing moderate numbers of cells with strong
AKR1C3 immunoreactivity (score 4), with mixed staining
seen in the liver core (score nos. 5 and 4; Fig. 5D). Occasional
weak positivity (score 1) was seen in bone marrow cell TMAs
(morphology undetermined). Notably, the intensity of
normal tissue staining was substantially less than that seen
with positive neoplasia samples, as illustrated by a side-byside macro comparison with a set of HCC cores (Fig. 5D).
Independently, 23 normal tissue sections were analyzed
and showed strong positive AKR1C3 staining in seven tissues; stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, kidney,
uterus and ovary, with weak/diffuse staining in the majority
of liver cells (Table 1). Most specimens showed both
nuclear and cytoplasmic staining but adrenal and liver
showed cytoplasmic staining only. Thus, the full section his-

Discussion
The observation that certain human neoplastic cell lines
are able to convert the bioreductive prodrug PR-104A to its
cytotoxic metabolites under oxygenated conditions led us to
seek the identity of the putative aerobic oxidoreductase(s).
Microarray analysis of 23 cell lines highlighted a cluster of
five AKR family 1 members (1B10, 1C1, 1C2, 1C3, and 1C4)
coordinately upregulated in a manner that correlated
with oxic PR-104A metabolism (compare Figs. 1D and 3A).
Plasmid-based cellular expression confirmed AKR
family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) as a functional PR-104A
nitroreductase. Recombinant AKR1C3, a ketosteroid reductase better known for its role in the pre-receptor regulation
of steroid hormones and prostaglandins (14, 26), was able to
catalyze NADPH-dependent reduction of PR-104A to the

hydroxylamine metabolite PR-104H in the presence of
oxygen (Fig. 2). Western blotting of the cell line panel shown
that AKR1C3 was expressed in 30% (7 of 23) of cell lines and
is correlated with elevated aerobic PR-104A reduction.
Expression of NQO1, a prototypic reporter gene for the
Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway (12), was only weakly correlated
with AKR1C3 expression, although AKR1C3 has recently been
reported to be regulated by this pathway (27). Keap1 knockdown induced AKR1C3 protein with attendant elevation of
PR-104A metabolism in MDA-231 cells (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that regulation of AKR1C3 by the Nrf2/Keap1
pathway is possible. In support, constitutive AKR1C3 expression in A549 and H460 cells was sensitive to knockdown
of Nrf2 activity (as confirmed by ARE-luciferase activity),
leading to reduced PR-104A metabolism, and implicating
the AKR1C3-positive phenotype as being associated with
the known Keap1 mutations in these cell lines (24, 28).
Notably, biallelic loss at the Keap1 locus is common in lung
cancer cell lines with attendant nuclear accumulation of
Nrf2 (24, 29), and expression of this AKR1 gene cluster
(including AKR1C3) has been proposed as a biomarker of
Nrf2 activation (27). However, Keap1 siRNA induced NQO1
but not AKR1C3 expression in HCT116 cells, indicating
that the two aerobic reductases are differentially regulated
in certain contexts.
In vitro, PR-104A displays hypoxia-selective toxicity
across all cell lines tested (hypoxic/aerobic cytotoxicity
ratio of 5–120; ref. 7). However, the role of hypoxia is less
apparent for PR-104 monotherapy of tumors in which hypoxic cells are a geometrically constrained minority population (Fig. 4C) and metabolite diffusion is mandatory
for single-agent activity. Consequently, tumor xenograft
sensitivity to PR-104 monotherapy (measured by clonogenic
survival; Fig. 4B) seems to be strongly, but not exclusively,
influenced by the more uniform presence of AKR1C3
(Fig. 4A) rather than the heterogeneous patterning of hypoxia
(Fig. 4C), suggesting that the bystander cell killing effect is
not in itself sufficient to exploit tumor hypoxia in a monotherapy context. This postulate is supported by several
lines of evidence, including the modest growth delay
achieved with PR-104 treatment of parental H1299 NSCLC
xenografts (TGI, 77%), despite the large hypoxic fraction
(62% pimonidazole-positive), and an ability of H1299 cells
to generate PR-104A metabolites 35-fold more efficiently
under hypoxia (11). Even in this hypoxia and hypoxic
metabolism–rich setting, expression of AKR1C3 is necessary
for substantial tumor control (TGI, 314%; Fig. 4D). This
supports our original observation that aerobic cell sensitivity
predicts in vivo activity as measured by tumor growth delay
(7), leading to the conclusion that AKR1C3 expression in
individual tumors may be an important determinant in
defining the most responsive patient population. However,
given that Nrf2 regulates a plethora of gene products associated with drug resistance (12, 30–32), one possibility is
that cellular resistance mechanisms may concurrently oppose AKR1C3-dependent sensitivity to PR-104. Nevertheless,
it is evident that AKR1C3-rich cell lines such as A549 and
H460 are sensitive in vitro and in vivo (7), despite constitu-

1582

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

tive upregulation of multiple Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective
genes (24, 28, 30) indicating that, on balance, a PR-104
sensitive phenotype prevails.
Whether AKR1C3 can be clinically exploited by PR-104
will depend in part on its expression in tumors relative to
normal tissues. Immunohistopathology of normal tissues
showed the expression of AKR1C3 in a subset of epithelial
cells in the stomach, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas,
liver, and kidney (Table 1), broadly consistent with literature
findings (23, 33–35). Some endothelial cell expression was
also evident. Of potential concern is the immunodetection
of AKR1C3 in a minority of bone marrow cells, particularly
in light of the recent report that CD34+ human myeloid
progenitor cells are positive for AKR1C3 mRNA (36). This
observation may be associated with the myelotoxic effects
of PR-104 in humans (10). A population analysis of AKR1C3
expression in tumor cores (2490 cases) showed that it is
strongly and frequently upregulated in some carcinomas
(Fig. 5B). Across 19 tumor types, the highest frequency of
strongly positive biopsies was in HCC, with many other
positive tumor types including bladder, renal, gastric, cervix, colon, and NSCLC (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S8).
Overexpression of AKR1C3 has been documented in carcinomas of the breast (23, 37, 38), prostate (39–41), endometrium (42, 43), and kidney (44). Surprisingly, the prostate
and breast carcinoma cores did not score highly in our
screen (see Supplementary Fig. S8 for validation and Supplementary Table S9 for independent laboratory analysis of
additional breast cancer tissue samples), suggesting these
TMAs (Supplementary Table S5) may be sourced from
early stage disease. Overall, the immunohistochemical analysis shows that the intensity of AKR1C3 expression is
strikingly elevated in certain tumors relative to normal
tissues (Fig. 5D). The distribution of AKR1C3 overexpression has prompted the evaluation of PR-104 in HCC and
NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00862082 and
NCT00862134, respectively). Collectively, these data indicate that AKR1C3 is a novel target for PR-104, and
AKR1C3 detection may identify individual patients with
PR-104–sensitive tumors.
