Abstract
The macrolide fungicide rapamycin has shown significant
antiproliferative action toward a variety of tumor types. In
this study, we used BK5.erbB2 transgenic mice as an animal
model to examine the therapeutic effect of rapamycin as a
potential treatment for gallbladder cancer. Homozygous
BK5.erbB2 mice overexpressing the wild-type rat erbB2 gene
in basal epithelial cells of the gallbladder have an f70%
incidence of gallbladder adenocarcinoma by 2 to 3 months of
age. Groups of mice (f2–3 months of age) were treated with
rapamycin by i.p. injection (once daily for 14 days) and then
sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment. Rapamycin significantly reduced the incidence and severity of gallbladder
carcinoma in BK5.erbB2 mice in a dose-dependent manner.
Tumors responsive to treatment exhibited a higher number of
apoptotic cells. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment led to
decreased levels of phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (Thr389) in
gallbladder tissue as assessed by both Western blot and
immunofluorescence analyses. Finally, immunofluorescence
staining revealed elevated phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) and
phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR;
Ser2448) in human gallbladder cancer compared with normal
gallbladder tissue. Based on our results using a novel
genetically engineered mouse model and the fact that the
Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in human gallbladder cancer,
rapamycin and related drugs may be effective therapeutic
agents for the treatment of human gallbladder cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
In the United States alone, f7,500 new cases of biliary tract
cancers are diagnosed per year, and 5,000 of those cases are
diagnosed as gallbladder cancer (1). Gallbladder cancer is a
relatively aggressive and frequently lethal disease, with a 5-year
survival rate of <5% (2). Many gallbladder carcinomas are at an
advanced stage at the time of diagnosis, and metastases to the liver
and regional lymph nodes are common. Chemotherapeutic agents
currently in use for treatment of gallbladder cancer include
mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and platinum analogues.

However, the reported response rates to these drugs are only 10%
to 24% (3), which in part contributes to the low survival rate of
patients afflicted with gallbladder cancer. Thus, more effective
strategies for the treatment of gallbladder cancer are essential to
improve the prognosis for gallbladder cancer patients.
Transgenic mouse models offer useful tools for studying the
effect of potential therapies for many types of cancer, including
gallbladder cancer. Previously, we showed that overexpression of
erbB2 in the basal layer of the biliary tract epithelium led to the
development of gallbladder adenocarcinoma in f70% of the
transgenic mice by 2 to 3 months of age (4, 5). The gallbladder
adenocarcinomas that develop in BK5.erbB2 mice have molecular
alterations similar to those reported in human gallbladder cancers,
such as overexpression and/or activation of erbB2, EGFR, c-MET,
and COX2 genes (6–9). Recently, we reported the therapeutic
efficacy of orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed at
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or to both EGFR and
erbB2 against gallbladder tumors that develop in this novel mouse
model (10). It is well documented that activation of growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinases can lead to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling,
including the EGFR (11, 12). Mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), also known as FRAP, RAFT1, and RAPT1, is a serine/
threonine kinase regulated by Akt. mTOR is a central regulator of
cell growth and proliferation and functions as a biological switch
between life and death that senses changes in the cellular
environment and helps cells respond to these changes (13).
Although the signal transduction pathway is not fully understood,
mTOR activation by PI3K/Akt plays a key role in regulating protein
translation through modulation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K)
and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1
(4E-BP1) function (14–16).
Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, binds the immunophilin
FK506 binding protein (FKBP12) to form the FKBP12-rapamycin
complex, which then interacts with and inhibits the activity of
mTOR (17). To date, studies have revealed that rapamycin can
potently arrest growth of cells derived from a broad spectrum of
cancers, including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, breast
cancer, prostate cancer, murine melanoma, leukemia, and B-cell
lymphoma (18–25). In addition, rapamycin and its derivatives
suppress growth of several human and murine tumors in vivo (e.g.,
small lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and breast
cancer; refs. 26–31). In the current study, we show that rapamycin
inhibits the growth of primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma that
develops in BK5.erbB2 mice by inhibition of mTOR function. This
signaling pathway is up-regulated in gallbladder tumors from
BK5.erbB2 mice as well as in advanced human gallbladder tumors.

Therapeutic Effect of Rapamycin on Gallbladder Cancer

These results suggest that rapamycin and related drugs may be
useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of human gallbladder
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Animals and experimental design. Homozygous BK5.erbB2 transgenic
mice (ICR genetic background) at 2 to 3 months of age were used for all
animal studies and were randomized according to age and sex between
vehicle-treated and rapamycin-treated groups to prevent potential bias.
Rapamycin (A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in 4% ethanol,
5.2% PEG400, and 5.2% Tween 80 and was given by i.p. injection once daily
for 14 days. Body weight was monitored daily. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after
the last injection of rapamycin.
Histologic analysis of gallbladder tissue. After the mice were
sacrificed, gallbladders were removed and fixed in formalin and embedded
in paraffin before sagittal sectioning. Sections of 5 Am were cut and stained
with H&E. Paraffin-embedded sections of human gallbladder cancer were
obtained from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, pooled epithelial cell
lysates were prepared from 50 gallbladders from nontransgenic mice,
5 gallbladder tumors from BK5.erbB2 mice, and 5 gallbladders from
BK5.erbB2 mice treated with rapamycin. Gallbladder cell lysates were
electrophoresed through 7% SDS/polyacrylamide gels as previously
described (5, 10). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% bovine
serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature in TBS [0.5 mol/L NaCl,
20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5)], protein levels of Akt, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt),
mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), p70S6K, and phosphorylated

p70S6K (p-p70S6K) were detected by incubating the membrane with the
corresponding primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against Akt, p-Akt
(Ser473), mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K, and p-p70S6K (Thr389; Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). FITC-conjugated, affinity-purified antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, West Grove, PA) was used as the
secondary antibody. Quantitation of Western blot data was done using a
densitometer.
Immunofluorescence staining. The expression and localization of pAkt, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K were determined using immunofluorescence
on sections of gallbladders as described previously (5). The primary and
secondary antibodies used are described above. The sections were analyzed
using an Olympus laser confocal microscope and an Olympus BX60
microscope.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end labeling
assay. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assay was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions using
an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Indianapolis, IN).
Statistical analysis. m2 tests were used to compare the incidence of
adenocarcinoma between vehicle-treated and rapamycin-treated groups.
The incidence of adenocarcinoma was then estimated as a binary outcome
from a logistic-regression model, using maximum-likelihood, to determine
if it was correlated to the dose of rapamycin.

Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin. Previous
studies, using other human tumor xenograft models (e.g. prostate),
have administrated rapamycin in the dose range of 0.1 to 40 mg/kg
in mice (26–31). We tested the tolerance of BK5.erbB2 transgenic
mice to 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg rapamycin administrated by i.p.
injection once daily for 14 days. Inflammation caused by injection,
histologic abnormalities of liver sections, and significant loss of
body weight were not observed in rapamycin-treated mice,
indicating that rapamycin treatment at these doses was well
tolerated in BK5.erbB2 mice. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
rapamycin on gallbladder carcinoma in BK5.erbB2 mice, we used
72 homozygous BK5.erbB2 transgenic mice at f2 to 3 months of
age and divided them into two age- and sex-matched groups. One
group of the mice received vehicle, and the other group received
2.5 mg/kg rapamycin by i.p. injection once daily for 14 days. All the
mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment. Gallbladder

adenocarcinoma incidence was calculated based on histologic
analyses of gallbladders from each group of mice. The gallbladder
adenocarcinoma incidence in the vehicle-treated group was 56%.
Twenty-eight percent of mice in this group had normal gallbladders, and 17% had hyperplastic gallbladders. As shown in Fig. 1A,
2.5 mg/kg rapamycin treatment significantly reduced the gallbladder adenocarcinoma incidence to 29% (P < 0.05, m2 test). The
percentage of mice that had noncancerous gallbladder was
increased to 71% (40% normal gallbladders and 31% hyperplastic
gallbladders). We also examined the effect of 1.25 and 5 mg/kg
rapamycin on gallbladder adenocarcinoma in a separate experiment. For this additional experiment, a total of 70 mice were
used. The mice were divided into three groups as follows: vehicle,
1.25 mg/kg rapamycin, and 5 mg/kg rapamycin. The treatment
protocol was identical to that used to evaluate the 2.5 mg/kg dose
of rapamycin. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1B.
The gallbladder adenocarcinoma incidence in the vehicle-treated
group was 67%. Twelve percent of mice in the vehicle-treated group
had normal gallbladders, and 21% had hyperplastic gallbladders.
Administration of 1.25 mg/kg rapamycin reduced the gallbladder
adenocarcinoma incidence to 57% and increased the incidence of
noncancerous gallbladders to 43% (26% normal and 17% hyperplastic gallbladder). Administration of 5 mg/kg rapamycin

significantly reduced the gallbladder adenocarcinoma incidence
to 39% and increased the noncancerous gallbladder incidence to
61% (26% normal and 35% hyperplastic gallbladders, respectively;
Fig. 1B; P < 0.05, m2 test). As shown in Fig. 2, probit analysis
indicated that the reduced incidence of gallbladder carcinoma
correlated with the dose of rapamycin administered (P = 0.014,
blogit).
To further evaluate the effect of rapamycin on gallbladder
tumors in BK5.erbB2 mice, TUNEL assays were done on gallbladder
tissue from vehicle-treated and rapamycin-treated mice. For these
analyses, we did TUNEL staining on four sets of tissues,
representatives of which are shown in Fig. 3A. TUNEL staining in
DNase I treated normal gallbladder epithelium is shown (top left)
as a control for TUNEL-positive cells. An adenocarcinoma from a
vehicle-treated mouse shows very few apoptotic cells (top right).
Only a small number of TUNEL-positive cells were present in a
gallbladder tumor that was apparently refractory to rapamycin
treatment (bottom left). Finally, Fig. 3A (bottom right) shows the
more typical findings observed in gallbladder tissue from
rapamycin-treated mice. In this regard, we observed a reversion
to a milder, hyperplastic phenotype with the presence of a
significant number of TUNEL-positive cells. Fifty percent of the
hyperplastic gallbladders from mice treated with rapamycin

exhibited this high level of apoptotic cells. Figure 3B shows the
actual percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in multiple gallbladder
sections from vehicle-treated or rapamycin-treated mice. The
average percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was increased in
hyperplastic gallbladders treated with rapamycin compared with
hyperplastic gallbladders from vehicle-treated mice. Interestingly,
the analysis of TUNEL staining in hyperplastic gallbladders from
the rapamycin-treated mice revealed two distinct types of staining
patterns. As noted above, 50% of the rapamycin-treated hyperplastic gallbladders had a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic
cells (15.3 F 3.3%) compared with that in the vehicle-treated
hyperplastic gallbladders (0 F 0%; P < 0.05). The other 50% of
rapamycin-treated hyperplastic gallbladders had few apoptotic
cells (0.9 F 1.6%) similar to the vehicle-treated hyperplastic
gallbladders. The combination of these two different types of
samples contributed to the high SD seen in Fig. 3B. Because the
gallbladder adenocarcinoma incidence in the rapamycin-treated
group was significantly reduced compared with that in the vehicletreated group, we believe that at least a portion of the hyperplastic
gallbladders with high apoptotic index were from adenocarcinomas
susceptible to rapamycin treatment. Although further work will be
necessary to prove it conclusively, many of the tumors that
responded to rapamycin treatment underwent apoptosis during
the process of reversion to a milder phenotype.
Analysis of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K status in gallbladder
tissue from BK5.erbB2 mice. To further explore the therapeutic
efficacy of rapamycin in the BK5.erbB2 mouse model, we examined
the status of its target mTOR and signaling molecules both
immediately upstream (Akt) and downstream (p70S6K). As shown
in Fig. 4, this signaling pathway is up-regulated in gallbladder tissue
of BK5.erbB2 mice compared with corresponding tissue from
nontransgenic mice. In this regard, Western blot analyses (Fig. 4A)
show elevated levels of p-Akt (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448), and
p-p70S6K (Thr389) in gallbladder tissue from transgenic mice. This
was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of gallbladder
tissue using phosphospecific antibodies as shown in Fig. 4B.

Effect of rapamycin on phosphorylation of mTOR and
p70S6K in gallbladder tissue from BK5.erbB2 mice. To
determine whether rapamycin treatment affected the incidence
of gallbladder cancer by inhibition of its target mTOR, we
examined the level of p-p70S6K (Thr389) by both Western blot
analysis and immunohistochemical staining of gallbladder tissues.
As shown in Fig. 5A, after quantitation, Western blot analyses
confirmed a reduced relative level of p-p70S6K in gallbladder tissue
from rapamycin-treated (5 mg/kg) mice compared with vehicletreated transgenic mice. In addition, this observation was
confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of tissue sections from
rapamycin-treated mice as shown in Fig. 5C. We also examined the
level of p-mTOR (Ser2448) in gallbladders from vehicle-treated or
rapamycin-treated mice by Western blot analysis. As shown in
Fig. 5B, the relative level of p-mTOR in gallbladders was not
significantly different between the vehicle-treated or rapamycintreated groups.
Analysis of Akt and mTOR status in human gallbladder
cancer. As part of the current study, we analyzed the status of
Akt and mTOR in human gallbladder cancer compared with
normal gallbladder tissue. Up-regulation of this signaling
pathway would provide a rationale for considering inhibition of
mTOR as a therapeutic strategy for human gallbladder cancer.
Immunofluorescence staining of p-Akt and p-mTOR was done in
27 human gallbladder adenocarcinoma (stage IIB diagnosed by
the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer) and 7
normal human gallbladders. The results showed that elevated
levels of p-Akt were observed in 74.1% (20 of 27) human
gallbladder cancer specimens and in only 28.6% (2 of 7) normal
human gallbladder specimens. Elevated levels of p-mTOR also
were observed in 92.6% (25 of 27) human gallbladder cancer
specimens and in only 28.6% (2 of 7) normal human gallbladder
specimens. These data reveal that human gallbladder adenocarcinoma has elevated p-Akt and p-mTOR levels compared with
noncancerous tissue. Representative images of immunofluorescence staining are shown in Fig. 6.

Discussion
The current study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic
efficacy of rapamycin against gallbladder carcinoma that develop
in a novel transgenic mouse model for this human cancer. We
found that the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway was activated in
gallbladder tissue from transgenic mice, and that the incidence of
gallbladder carcinoma in BK5.erbB2 mice was significantly reduced
in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with rapamycin.
This effect of rapamycin correlated with a reduction in phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 (Fig. 5). The effect of rapamycin was
seen as a reduction of cancer incidence with reversion to a milder
phenotype, either hyperplasia or a relatively normal epithelium,
after 14 days of treatment. In addition, evidence was obtained that
tumors responsive to rapamycin treatment displayed a significant
increase in apoptotic cells. This was seen primarily as an increase
in apoptotic cells in hyperplastic gallbladder epithelium of
rapamycin-treated mice. Finally, we found evidence that the Akt/
mTOR pathway is activated in human gallbladder cancers. Overall,
the current results suggest that targeting this signaling pathway
either alone or in combination with other agents may be an
effective therapeutic strategy for this disease.
As noted in the Introduction, we have shown that the
adenocarcinomas that develop in BK5.erbB2 transgenic mice have
constitutively activated EGFR and increased EGFR/erbB2 heterodimer formation (5, 10). In addition, our previous studies have
shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway
is activated, and that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is
elevated in gallbladder tissue and tumors obtained from these
mice (5, 10). As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K

pathway is also activated in gallbladder tumors that develop in
these mice. The activation of Akt is known to occur downstream of
growth factor receptors such as the EGFR via activation of PI3K
(11, 12, 32–35). Thus, the activation of this pathway in gallbladder
tissue and tumors of BK5.erbB2 mice is likely due to up-regulation
of erbB signaling. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this
signaling pathway is activated in human gallbladder cancer as
well (see Fig. 6). In the latter case, activation of Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway could also result from elevated erbB activation
as a significant percentage of human gallbladder tumors have been
shown to overexpress erbB2, EGFR, or both (6, 7, 36–42). In
addition, overexpression of transforming growth factor-a has also
been reported in human gallbladder carcinoma (43). Interestingly,
mRNA levels of two important downstream mediators of Akt/
mTOR signaling (p70S6K and 4E-BP1) were found to be upregulated in human biliary tract cancer (44). These latter data
further support a potential role for mTOR signaling in human
biliary tract cancer.
mTOR is a central signaling molecule downstream of Akt (13). It
is known that mTOR integrates signaling from both growth factors
and nutrients, and that it can regulate cell growth and cell cycle
progression (reviewed in refs. 13, 15, 45–47). In addition, mTOR
signaling is up-regulated in a significant number of human tumors
either through up-regulation of Akt or other regulatory pathways
(reviewed in refs. 13–16, 45–47). Increasing evidence supports a
critical role for mTOR as a regulator of protein synthesis and
translation initiation (13–16, 45–47). mTOR can phosphorylate a
number of substrates, including p70S6K and 4E-BP1 (14–16, 45–47).
Phosphorylation of these two substrates seems to be essential for
protein synthesis and translation initiation in response to nutrients

and growth factors. As noted in the Introduction, blockade of this
pathway using either pharmacologic or genetic approaches has
been shown to inhibit growth of a number of tumors/tumor cell
lines (18–29, 48, 49). Rapamycin inhibits mTOR by inhibiting its
kinase activity through binding to FKBP12 (17). As shown in Fig. 5,
rapamycin treatment significantly reduced the level of p-p70S6K
(Thr389) in gallbladder tissue of BK5.erbB2 mice. This effect is
consistent with its ability to inhibit mTOR and correlated with the
reduction in carcinoma incidence.
At the cellular level, the exact mechanism for the effect of
rapamycin on gallbladder tumors of BK5.erbB2 mice will require
further investigation. However, our initial analyses suggest that
rapamycin treatment induced apoptosis in cells of responsive
tumors, causing a reversion to a less severe phenotype (i.e.,
hyperplasia). This could have occurred through inhibition of mTOR
phosphorylation and decreased protein synthesis. Alternatively or
perhaps in addition, rapamycin may have altered the levels and/or
activity of antiapoptotic molecules such as Bcl2 and Stat3 (13). The
presence of a small number of tumors that seemed resistant to
rapamycin treatment in this model is interesting. Recently, we
reported a similar finding when examining the therapeutic efficacy
of TKIs against gallbladder tumors in BK5.erbB2 mice (10). Several
possible mechanisms could explain refractoriness to rapamycin in
human tumors (48). It is clear from our previous and current work
that there is some heterogeneity in the tumors that develop in
BK5.ebB2 mice. Tumor heterogeneity could be the basis of this
resistance. For example, some tumors might have acquired
additional genetic alterations that overcame the blockade of

mTOR by rapamycin. Further work with these tumors may help to
shed light on resistance mechanisms and other pathways that
could be targeted pharmacologically in combination with rapamycin to effectively treat these tumors.
In summary, the current data suggest that rapamycin can reduce
the incidence of gallbladder carcinoma in a relevant mouse model
for human gallbladder cancer. This drug and other drugs that target
mTOR may be a useful chemotherapeutic approach for treating
human gallbladder cancer given that this pathway seems to be
activated in human gallbladder tumors. Furthermore, targeting
mTOR using rapamycin in combination with other agents may also
be an effective strategy for treating biliary tract cancers. For
example, in addition to TKIs, which we have shown recently to be
effective therapeutic agents in this model (10), COX-2 inhibitors have
also shown effectiveness in this model (50).5 Future work in the
BK5.erbB2 mouse model of biliary tract cancer will explore these and
other combinations for their effectiveness. The long-term goal is to
translate these findings into human clinical trials.
