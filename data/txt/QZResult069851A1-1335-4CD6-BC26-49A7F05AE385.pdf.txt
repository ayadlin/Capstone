Abstract
To find a more effective and less toxic chemotherapeutic agent,
we have successfully prepared crystalline camptothecin-20(S)O-propionate hydrate (CZ48) by reacting camptothecin with
propionic anhydride using concentrated sulfuric acid as
catalyst. The biological effectiveness of this new anticancer
agent was evaluated by using xenografts of human cancers
in nude mice as the testing models. The extensive treatment
of 21 human tumors with various dose levels of CZ48 has
shown that this agent is highly effective against many
different human tumors tested with a striking lack of
toxicity. Of the 21 human tumor lines tested, 9 regressed, 5
were <10% of the control, 3 were <20%, and 2 were <40%.
Two tumors did not respond. The total response rate was
90% (19 of 21). No toxicity was observed in mice. The
effective doses required to achieve the positive response
varied from 100 to 1,000 mg/kg/d depending on the tumors.
The maximum tolerated dose was not reached because of
the nontoxic nature of the drug in mice. Thus, this
compound has a much wider therapeutic index compared
with that of the existing anticancer drugs currently in use.

Introduction
Aside from the cancer itself, the biggest enemy that most
cancer patients still face, while undergoing treatment with
chemotherapy, is the high toxicity (or side effects) associated
with the various anticancer drugs. The therapeutic index (TI),
defined as a ratio of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to the
effective dose, of each anticancer drug provides a quantitative
assessment of its relative toxic and therapeutic effects. As most
chemotherapeutic agents clinically used today have very narrow
TI ranges (f1), patients receiving chemotherapy often suffer
greatly from many toxic side effects while receiving treatment at
therapeutic dose levels. The various anticancer agents are
characterized by differences in grades and types of toxicity,
influenced by the specifics of their pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics. For example, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of
the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for the
systemic and palliative treatment of patients with cancers arising
from the gastrointestinal tract, breast, head, and neck. In the

catabolism of 5-FU, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)
serves as the initial and rate-limiting enzyme. A DPD deficiency
is increasingly being recognized as an important pharmacogenetic
condition involved in the etiology of severe 5-FU–associated
toxicity. It has been reported that cancer patients who were
genetically heterozygous or homozygous for a mutant allele of the
gene encoding DPD suffered from more severe toxicity and even
death following the administration of 5-FU (1, 2). Platinum agents,
also commonly used in chemotherapy, exhibit other toxicities; a
substantial body of literature documents the side effects of
platinum compounds. Cisplatin, for instance, has multiple
toxicities, including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity,
nausea, and vomiting (3). The nephrotoxicity of cisplatin almost
led to its abandonment until Cvitkovi and colleagues (4, 5)
introduced aggressive hydration, which prevented the development of acute renal failure. Thus, the toxicity of cisplatin actually
became a driving force in the history of chemotherapy in the
search both for less toxic analogues and for more effective
treatment of the side effects of the drug. For other platinum
agents such as carboplatin, myelosuppression, which is not usually
severe with cisplatin, presents as the dose-limiting toxicity (6), and
for oxaliplatin, the dose-limiting toxicity comes from sensory
neuropathy (3), a characteristic of all DACH-containing platinum
derivatives. Alkylating agents are another class of drugs with an
important role in cancer treatment. Each alkylating agent has its
own specific associated toxicity and will not be discussed
individually here. Instead, listed here are some toxicities common
to alkylating agents as a class: hematopoietic toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, gonadal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, alopecia,
teratogenicity, carcinogenesis, and immunosuppression. Among
these, the usual dose-limiting toxicity for an alkylating agent is its
hematopoietic toxicity. Finally, topoisomerase-interactive agents
comprise yet another class of chemotherapeutic drugs that have
increasingly gained attention from clinical oncologists for their
unique mechanisms of action. Topotecan, one of these topoisomerase-interactive agents, is indicated in the second-line
treatment of advanced refractory ovarian (7) and small cell lung
cancers (8, 9), and it also has been active in the treatment of
hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes
and multiple myeloma (10). The dose-limiting toxicity of this
agent is myelosuppression. Although topotecan has been combined with a variety of other treatments, including radiation,
cisplatin, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, in clinical trials, none of
these combinations has achieved any routine use in clinical
oncology. This may be due, in part, to the frequent myelosuppressive toxicity of topotecan that has made it difficult to
combine in high doses with other bone marrow–suppressive
agents (11). Irinotecan, another topoisomerase-interactive agent,
is indicated as a single agent or in combination with 5-FU and

leucovorin in treating patients with colorectal cancers (12, 13) and
has also been found to be active in small cell lung cancer when
given in combination with cisplatin. This combination has also
been found to be active in non–small cell lung cancer (10). The
dose-limiting toxicities of irinotecan are neutropenia and delayedonset diarrhea; the uses of irinotecan in clinical oncology are thus
limited. Other anticancer agents, including recently marketed
Erbitux and Avastin, occasionally used by oncologists for specific
treatments, are likewise limited due to their associated toxicities.
Thus, the biggest challenge is still for cancer researchers and
clinical oncologists to find better chemotherapeutic agents with
wider TIs.
As a class, the camptothecins have a broad spectrum of
anticancer activity. Wall and colleagues (14) isolated and purified
the molecule from the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminate in
1966; they subsequently tested the compound against mouse
leukemia L1210 system and found that the compound was
active. However, the early human clinical trials in 1970s failed to
prove the true values of the compound for clinical oncology,
instead showed severe, unpredictable toxicities, such as hemorrhagic cystitis. The trials were accordingly halted. The interest in
this family of compounds was renewed in the mid-1980s by the
finding that the molecular target of camptothecins was the
nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I (15). At approximately the same
time, new water-soluble derivatives such as topotecan and
irinotecan were prepared and biologically evaluated. The
subsequent clinical evaluations of these two compounds showed
the predictable toxicities and meaningful anticancer activity (16).
Topotecan was approved in 1996 as second-line treatment for
advanced ovarian cancer, and it later gained the indication for
treating patients with refractory small cell lung cancer. In the
same year, irinotecan was approved for treating 5-FU–refractory

advanced colorectal cancer. The S-configured lactone form of
camptothecin molecule is thought to be required for antitumor
activity. The carboxylate form is only 10% as active as the
lactone form as an anticancer agent. The two forms of the
molecule exist in equilibrium in aqueous solution. This
equilibrium is pH dependent. The lactone is not stable in the
body of mammals at the slightly basic physiologic pH (7.4). Even
worse, in man, the human serum albumin has a high affinity for
the carboxylate form of the molecule (17, 18), binding it and
moving the equilibrium between it and the lactone form to the
right (CPTX CPT). Because of this, when we treated human
tumors as xenografts in nude mice with camptothecin or its
derivatives such as 9-nitrocamptothecin and 9-aminocamptothecin, we obtained excellent results (19, 20), but when we went
into human clinical trials, the complete responses became
sporadic (21). This is no surprising because in mice 50% of
the CPT was in the active lactone form (22), whereas in man the
percentage dropped to 3% to 5%.
In efforts of finding better camptothecin analogues for
treatment, we previously synthesized many different camptothecin
esters by attaching an ester chain in position C-20 and
subsequently evaluated these compounds (23, 24). The treatment
of human tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice with our
synthetic camptothecin esters was effective and toxicity in mice
was minimal (25, 26). Based on these results, we went deeper in the
direction and successfully prepared crystalline camptothecin-20(S)O-propionate hydrate (CZ48). We subsequently tested this new
agent given by gavage against 21 different human tumors grown as
xenografts in mice and found that this compound has a broad
spectrum of antitumor activity with a dramatic lack of toxicity in
mice at variable dose ranges. The effective doses required for
various tumors were established varying from 100 to 1,000 mg/kg/d.

The corresponding TIs were also calculated and found to be
tremendously improved compared with that of most anticancer
agents clinically used today by oncologists. We now report our
results.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of crystalline CZ48. To a 200 mL round-bottomed flask
equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a sand bath were added 20 g
camptothecin (0.05747 mole) and 100 mL propionic anhydride (97%;
Aldrich Chemical Co.). The mixture was heated by sand bath while
stirring. A few drops (8–10) of concentrate sulfuric acid (95–98%; A.C.S.
reagent; Aldrich Chemical) were added dropwise when the sand bath
temperature reached 80jC. The mixture was then stirred at 110 F 10jC
overnight (f14 h). After cooling down to room temperature, the reaction
mixture was poured onto 1,000 mL ice water portion by portion while
stirring. After keeping stirring for f45 min, the mixture was filtrated. The
residue obtained from filtration was allowed air-drying for 24 h. The dried

crude product was transferred into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask
equipped with a heating mantle. To this crude product was added 200 mL
absolute ethanol (99.5%, 200 proof; Aldrich Chemical). The mixture was
allowed to reflux for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. The pure
product (CZ48) was obtained as crystals after crystallization from ethanol.
Purity 99.8% [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)], yield
97%, melting point 242jC. A single crystal of CZ48 for X-ray structural
analysis was prepared by dissolving 200 mg samples obtained above in
50 mL absolute ethanol.
Crystal structural determination of CZ48. Single-crystal X-ray analysis
was done by using a Siemens SMART diffractometer equipped with chargecoupled device area detector. A crystal with dimensions of 0.4  0.08  0.02
mm was mounted in glass fiber under a stream of cold nitrogen gas at
60jC. Monochromatic Mo K a1 radiation (k = 0.71073 Å) was used to
collect a full hemisphere of data with the narrow-frame method. The data
were integrated using the Siemens SAINT program, and the intensities were
corrected for Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption
due to variation in the path length. Empirical absorption correction was
applied and redundant reflections were averaged. Final cell parameters were

calculations were made with using the Siemens SHELXTL programs
package.
In vivo antitumor activity determination. All the animal experiments
were performed on nude Swiss mice of the NIH, high-fertility strain. They
were bred and raised in our laboratory under strict pathogen-free
conditions. For antitumor activity determination, a tumor xenograft
growing in a nude mouse, f1 cm3 in size, was surgically removed under
sterile conditions, finely minced with iridectomy scissors, and suspended
in cell culture medium at the ratio of 1:10 (v/v). One tenth to one quarter
of 1 mL of this suspension, containing f50 mg of wet weight tumor
mince, was s.c. inoculated on the upper half of the dorsal thorax of the
mouse. Groups of six animals were used. CZ48 was finely suspended in
cottonseed oil and then injected into the stomach cavity of the mouse
through the anterior abdominal wall using a 26-gauge needle or
administered by gavage. The weekly schedule used for oral administration
of CZ48 was once a day for 7 d, or 5 d on and 2 d off. This schedule was

www.aacrjournals.org

used throughout all the animal experiments. Treatment was initiated
when the tumor had reached a volume of f200 mm3 (i.e., well
vascularized, measurable, and growing exponentially). Tumors growing
in animals were checked daily and measured with a caliper two times per
week. The effective doses were established when a positive response in
mouse was reached.
In vivo toxicity determination. Groups of five or six animals having
about the same ages and weights were chosen and treated with CZ48 by
gavage at doses of 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg/d, respectively, and continuously
or on a schedule of 5 d on, 2 d off. The body weight changes in animals
during the treatment were recorded for treated group versus untreated
group starting at day 1.
The determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of CZ48.
Camptothecin-20-O-acetate, an analogue of CZ48, was used as an internal
standard for determining all pharmacokinetic parameters of CZ48. A
100 AL plasma from the mouse treated with CZ48 at dose of 2,000 mg/kg
was transferred into a 2 mL test tube, and then 100 AL of internal
standard working solution (400 ng/mL) were also added to the tube. To
the mixture were also added 200 AL of 1% acetic acid solution and 1 mL
ethyl ether. After vortex mixing for 10 s, the mixture was incubated at
room temperature on a shaker for 10 min and then centrifuged at
10,000  g for 15 min. The upper layer obtained from the centrifugation
was transferred into a clean tube and evaporated to dryness using an

evaporator at 40jC under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was
reconstituted in 200 AL of water/acetonitrile (50/50, v/v) solvent system,
and a 20 AL portion of the aliquot was injected into HPLC system for
analysis. For the study, a 100 AL blank plasma from untreated mouse was
also processed in the same manner as the treated. The important
pharmacokinetic parameters of CZ48 and CPT in 48 mice were obtained
from the HPLC analysis and this HPLC procedure was previously
established in our laboratory (27).

Results
The reaction for synthesizing CZ48 is depicted in Fig. 1. The
structure of CZ48 was determined by single-crystal X-ray
analysis and shown in Fig. 2. In each crystal unit, one molecule
of CZ48 is linked to three molecules of water through strong
hydrogen bonds and all of the molecules are linked to each
other through a H2O bridge. CZ48 was tested against 21
different human tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice. The
tumors included were one bladder, four breast, four colon, two
desmoplastic small round cell tumor, two melanoma, two lung,
and five pancreatic lines. The drug suspension was orally
administered to the human tumor-bearing mice once a day,
7 days a week, or according to a schedule of 5 days on and
2 days off, for the duration of the treatment period. Table 1
shows that, of these 21 tumor lines tested, 19 showed either
regressions or significant growth inhibitions (>50%). The length
of treatment was different from tumor to tumor and was
decided according to the growth rate of the tumors. Nine tumor
lines regressed completely and the other 10 tumor lines showed
percentage inhibitions versus controls ranging from 62.5 to 99.5.
The continuous daily schedule of CZ48 administration showed a
better response rate than the 5/2 (on/off ) schedule of
administration. The two schedules exhibited no differences with
respect to toxicity in mice. The degree of inhibition was shown
to be dose dependent. Figure 3A shows the direct correlation
between the doses and the corresponding inhibitions. Body
weight changes for both control and test animals were recorded
during treatment as shown in Table 2, and no significant body
weight changes were observed for most animals during the
treatment. Only the Cln-McC and Cln-SW48 testing groups had
17% and 15% body weight losses, respectively. Animals in the
Bl-BOL and P-MIA groups had body weight losses slightly >10%.
All other treated groups at all dose levels had body weight
losses <10%. Such small body weight changes may even be
attributed to causes such as the tumor itself or initial response
to the gavage procedure other than the side effects of CZ48. In
fact, these slight losses in body weight for most animals were
completely reversed when the treatment period was sufficiently
long, most likely because the sufficient length of treatment
allowed the initial reactions to the gavage procedure to be
corrected in the animals. To have an objective judgment of the
toxicity of the drug, we performed toxicity studies with healthy
mice. We chose three groups of mice, of similar ages and
weights. One group was used as control, and the other two
groups were treated with CZ48 at two dose levels, 1,000 and
2,000 mg/kg/d, respectively. Figure 3B shows the results of the
treatment with 2,000 mg/kg/d. Animals in the test groups
received the drug in suspension form daily by gavage. Animals
in the control group only received the vehicle, also daily by
gavage. The results in Fig. 3B were from 280 days after
treatment initiation. We did not find any body weight losses at

all during this long treatment; in fact, the body weights of these
treated mice increased slightly.
Pharmacokinetic absorption profile of CZ48 with a single dose of
50, 100, 150, 300, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg/d, respectively, was
recorded following an oral administration to nude mice. Table 3A
shows all important pharmacokinetic parameters.
For all responsive tumors, the effective doses required to achieve
inhibitions were established and the corresponding TIs were
calculated by using 2,000 mg/kg/d as the MTD. The results are
shown in Table 3B.

Figure 3. A, correlations between dose levels and the corresponding inhibitions.
Three groups of tumor-bearing mice were treated with 100, 200, and
300 mg/kg/d of CZ48, respectively. The mean of the tumor sizes of each group
measured at each time point was plotted versus treatment time. B, body weight
changes in healthy mice during 280 d of the treatment. The test group was
treated with 2,000 mg/kg/d CZ48 (suspended in cottonseed oil) daily for the
duration of the treatment period by gavage. The control group was treated by the
cottonseed oil only, also daily for the duration of treatment period by gavage.
C, antitumor activity of commercial CPT-11 against human SPA lung carcinoma
with oral administration of 8 mg/kg/d. This dose was safe to animals treated
under our experimental conditions. Under this dose level, CPT-11 did not show
significant inhibitory effects. D, antitumor activity of CZ48 against human SPA
lung carcinoma with oral administration of 300 mg/kg/d. Under this dose level,
CZ48 was effective and showed great inhibitions.

Discussion
Compared with most conventional anticancer agents clinically
used today by oncologists, CZ48 is more effective and has a
much higher response rate. Nineteen of 21 human tumor lines
treated with CZ48 in our laboratory (90%) achieved either
regressions or growth inhibitions. We also treated seven human
tumor lines grown in mice as xenografts with nine conventional
anticancer agents, such as Adriamycin, Alkeran, BiCNU (carmustine), cyclophosphamide, 5-FU, methotrexate, methyl CNU,
vincristine, and vinblastine. The seven lines were BRO melanoma, CLO breast, FOS melanoma, HT29 colon, MUR breast, SQU
colon, and WAR breast. Each tumor line was treated,
respectively, with these nine agents. Totally, 56 treating experiments were conducted. The dose for each treatment with one of
these agents was calculated according to the commercial
recommendation. Of the 56 treatments, only 5 were found to
be effective; CLO breast was responsive to the treatments,
respectively, with Alkeran, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
vinblastine, and WAR breast with 5-FU; all other 51 were
essentially ineffective. Thus, all these nine agents combined gave
a 9% (5 of 56) response rate, one tenth of CZ48’s. Irinotecan
(CPT-11) has probably been a camptothecin analogue mostly
used by oncologists for certain treatments. To compare CZ48
with irinotecan, the in vitro IC50 data of CZ48 and irinotecan
were, respectively, obtained by measuring the inhibitory effects
of these two drugs against HT29, McCN, DOY, and BRO human
cancer cell lines. CZ48 is more potent than irinotecan across all
four tested cell lines. Table 3C summarizes the results. The
in vivo anticancer activities of CZ48 and irinotecan against
human lung carcinoma (SPA) were also compared with each
other by using same schedules and same oral administrations.
Irinotecan was toxic in mice if the dose was higher than 12 mg/kg/d

Test (g)

under our experimental conditions, and thus, we chose 8 mg/kg/d
as the dose for irinotecan treatment; this dose was safe to mice.
CZ48 was safe to mice ranging from 1 to 2,000 mg/kg/d. We
chose 300 mg/kg/d as the dose for CZ48 treatment. This dose
previously showed effectiveness against SPA lung carcinoma. The
results (Fig. 3C and D) showed that irinotecan was not effective
at this chosen dose level and CZ48 expressed great anticancer
activity at this nontoxic dose of 300 mg/kg/d. In addition to its
shown effectiveness, CZ48 was found to be nontoxic in mice.
Healthy animals treated with CZ48 at 2,000 mg/kg/d for >9
months slightly gained body weights. This indicates that CZ48 is
completely nontoxic in mice even. Under our experimental
conditions, we were not able to reach MTD in mice. The dose
of 2,000 mg/kg/d was the highest one we were able to reach by
gavage and the highest dose we had ever been able to reach in
our laboratory. The required effective doses varied depending on
the types of tumors. Two tumor lines showed great inhibitory
effects by administration of 100 mg/kg/d, and others required as
high as 1,000 mg/kg/d to achieve the same. Using 2,000 mg/kg/d
as MTD, the TIs for CZ48 were calculated according to the
definition given in the introduction section ranging from 2 to 20
(Table 3B). This TI range is much wider than that (f1) of most
anticancer agents currently used in clinical oncology; none of
which can be continuously used for long periods of time at the
effective dose. Speculatively, the lack of toxicity of CZ48 in mice is
because of the inactive nature of the drug itself and the high
stability of the lactone moiety of the molecule in blood. The drug
is probably activated in cancerous tissues by an enzyme (or
enzymes) called esterase (or esterases).
The peak concentrations (i.e., C max) in blood for all doses were
reached within 2 hours. C max (ng/mL) increased from 77.9 to 190.9
when the dose (mg/kg/d) increased from 50 to 2,000. The area

*Experimental conditions for pharmacokinetic absorption studies: species, four female mice; feeding conditions, fasting; vehicle/formulation,
suspension in cottonseed oil; method of administration, gavage; sample, plasma; analyte, CZ48; assay, HPLC.
cTIs were calculated according to the definition given in Introduction using 2,000 mg/kg/d as MTD (i.e., TI = 2,000/effective dose).

under the curve (AUC; nghmL1) also increased from 789.9 to
1,687.0 for AUC0-t and from 786.7 to 3,283.9 for AUC0-8 when the
dose increased from 50 to 2,000. The ranges of elimination halflives (t 1/2) of CZ48 were from 8 to 25 hours for these seven doses.
CZ48 stayed in blood longer when the dose was lower. The
elimination t 1/2 was f19 hours for dose 50 mg/kg/d, 15 hours for
100 mg/kg/d, and 14 hours for 150 mg/kg/d. The t 1/2s became
much shorter when the dose reached z300 mg/kg/d. The t 1/2
became much longer (24.9 hours) again when the dose was
2,000 mg/kg/d. This 24.9-hour value probably did not reflect the
real elimination rate of the drug because the stomach of the mouse
was full of drug when 2,000 mg/kg/d was administered, and thus,
the mouse needed the longer time to digest the drug and/or to
get the drug excreted.
Multiple daily doses (i.e., two or three times per day) may be
even better for cancer treatment, as the mean elimination t 1/2 of
CZ48 for six single doses (50–1,000 mg/kg/d) is f13 hours and the
mean elimination t 1/2 for three single higher doses (300, 500, and
1,000 mg/kg/d) is <10 hours (9.7 hours).

Thus, the new anticancer agent CZ48 has shown a broad
spectrum of anticancer activity against xenografts of human
tumors in nude mice with a striking lack of toxicity. An
Investigational New Drug application to the American Food and
Drug Administration was approved to proceed. Human clinical
trials with this new agent are ongoing and the results from these
human studies will be separately reported.
