Abstract
The peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase Pin1 interacts with phosphorylated proteins, altering their conformation. The retinoic acid
receptor RARA and the acute-promyelocytic-leukemia–specific counterpart PML-RARA directly interact with Pin1. Overexpression of Pin1 inhibits ligand-dependent activation of
RARA and PML-RARA. Inhibition is relieved by Pin1-targeted
short interfering RNAs and by pharmacologic inhibition of the
catalytic activity of the protein. Mutants of Pin1 catalytically
inactive or defective for client-protein–binding activity are
incapable of inhibiting ligand-dependent RARA transcriptional activity. Functional inhibition of RARA and PML-RARA by
Pin1 correlates with degradation of the nuclear receptors via
the proteasome-dependent pathway. In the acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines HL-60 and NB4, Pin1 interacts with
RARA in a constitutive fashion. Suppression of Pin1 by a
specific short hairpin RNA in HL-60 or NB4 cells stabilizes
RARA and PML-RARA, resulting in increased sensitivity to the
cytodifferentiating and antiproliferative activities of all-trans
retinoic acid. Treatment of the two cell lines and freshly
isolated acute myelogenous leukemia blasts (M1 to M4) with
ATRA and a pharmacologic inhibitor of Pin1 causes similar
effects. Our results add a further layer of complexity to the
regulation of nuclear retinoic acid receptors and suggest that
Pin1 represents an important target for strategies aimed at
increasing the therapeutic index of retinoids. [Cancer Res
2009;69(3):1016–26]

ATRA is the only differentiating agent used in the clinics, being
part of the standard treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL; ref. 2). The majority of APL cases is characterized by
expression of PML-RARa (3, 4), an aberrant form of RARa, which is
the major retinoid receptor in myeloid cells. ATRA induces
maturation of the APL blast along the granulocytic pathway (4).
Despite expression of RARa (5), acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) types other than APL are generally refractory to retinoidinduced differentiation. This and toxicity issues hamper a more
general use of ATRA and derivatives in the management of AML.
Strategies aimed at increasing the therapeutic index of retinoids
are important goals (6–11).
The activity and stability of nuclear retinoid receptors, including
pathologic PML-RARa, and accessory proteins are modulated by
various signals, such as phosphorylation events (12–14). The
proteolytic degradation of RARs, PML-RARa, coactivator, and
corepressors via the proteasome-dependent pathway is an
emerging control system for the activity of retinoid receptor
complexes (15–17). The regulation of these multilayered processes
offers many opportunities of pharmacologic intervention aimed at
potentiating the therapeutic activity of ATRA (18).
Pin1 is a unique peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase recognizing phosphorylated Ser(Thr)-Pro motifs of client proteins (19). Pin1
isomerizes the Ser(Thr)-Pro bond from cis to trans, altering the
conformation of target proteins (20), often routing them along
the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway (19, 21, 22). The
enzyme is an interesting target of intervention, as it is overexpressed in various types of neoplasia (23), including AML (24), and
RARa may be one of its client proteins (25).

Introduction
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a physiologic modulator of
myeloid cells. Most of the activities of ATRA and derivatives
(retinoids) are mediated by specific nuclear receptors, which are
ligand-dependent transcription regulators acting as retinoid X
receptor/retinoic acid receptor (RXR/RAR) heterodimers (1). The
receptors control target genes via binding to cognate DNA
consensus sequences [retinoic acid responsive element (RARE)].

Materials and Methods
Cells. NB4 (26), HL-60 (27), NB4.007 (28), HL-60R (29), PR-9 (30), COS-7
cells, and freshly isolated AML blasts from the peripheral blood of five
patients (Supplementary Table S1) were cultured as described (6, 7, 9, 11,
31). To generate polyclonal populations of NB4 and HL-60 cells silenced for
Pin1, the two cell lines were electroporated with a plasmid containing a
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase (32).
Reagents. Diethyl-1,3,6,8-tetrahydro-1,3,6,8-tetraoxobenzo[lmn][3,8]pheenanthroline-2,7-diacetate (PiB), MG132, and ATRA were from Calbiochem
and Sigma. The predesigned Pin1 (S10545)–targeted and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)–targeted short interfering RNAs
(siRNA) were obtained from Ambion.
Pull-down, far-Western, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot
analyses. Pull-down experiments (33) were conducted on COS-7 cells
transiently transfected with RARa and PML-RARa cDNAs (11). Proteins
were precipitated with a purified glutathione S -transferase (GST)

Pin1 Is a Negative Regulator of RARa
Pin1 fusion protein after incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads
(Amersham). Precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis
using anti-RARa or anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pulldown experiments were also done with a GST-fusion protein of the Pin1
WW domain (33) and purified recombinant RARa (34). For these
experiments, RARa was preincubated with catalytically active extracellular
signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1; Cell Signaling Technology).
Far-Western experiments (35) were performed on COS-7 cell extracts
transfected with a RARa cDNA. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with
anti-RARa antibodies [Mab 9a (F)] (14), and incubated with purified
recombinant GST-tagged wild-type (WT), WW-domain, Y23/A, and C113/A
mutants of Pin1 (32, 33). Blots were developed with the anti-Pin1 (Millipore)
or anti-RARa (36) antibodies.
Immunoprecipitation (anti-RARa and anti-Pin1 antibodies) and Western
blot experiments were performed on cellular extracts of HL-60, NB4, or COS7 cells transfected with Pin1 and RARa cDNAs (17). Other Western blots
were developed with anti-actin, anti-cEBPh, anti–STAT-1, anti–phosphoSTAT-1, and anti-RXRa (11, 16) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
RARa and PML-RARa transactivation. COS-7 cells were transfected
with RARa, PML-RARa, and/or WT as well as mutant Pin1 cDNAs (WWdomain, Y23/A, and S67/E, which is catalytically inactive and functionally
equivalent to C113/A; refs. 32, 33) in the presence of the RARE-containing
DR5-tk-CAT (chloramphenicol-acetyl transferase; ref. 9), DR5-tk-luciferase
or h2RARE-luciferase reporter constructs (37). For the luciferase and CAT
reporter genes, the normalization plasmids are a renilla luciferase construct
(Promega) and pCH110 (containing the bacterial h-galactosidase cDNA; ref.
9), respectively. CAT (9), firefly, and renilla luciferase (Promega) as well as
h-galactosidase (9) activities were measured as detailed. The transactivation
experiments conducted in NB4 and HL-60 cells as well as derived shRNA
stably transfected cells were performed with an electroporation apparatus
(Bio-Rad) using a described protocol (37).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, nitroblue tetrazolium reductase, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis and determination of nitroblue tetrazolium
reductase (NBT-R) activity were performed as described (11). Real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with Taqman gene
expression assays (RARh, Hs00233407_m1; Egr1, Hs00152928_m1; CYP26,
Hs00175627_m1; h-actin endogenous control, 4333762F; Applied Biosystems). Amplification of the paxillin (PXN) mRNA was performed in the
presence of the Sybr-green dye (Applied Biosystems). In the case of RARh,
the results are expressed as relative quantities of the amplified mRNA, using
h-actin as the external amplification standard. The number of cycles
necessary for the amplification of h-actin does not vary significantly across
the various experimental points (15–16 cycles). The amount of RARh
transcript amplified in pR-NB4 and pR-HL-60 cells after treatment with
ATRA is considered to have a value of 1; ‘‘nd’’ means the value is below the
limit of detection of the assay (lack of signal after 35 cycles of amplification).
In the case of all the other transcripts, the values are expressed as the ratio
of the QR values [QR = 2 DDCt; Ct = cycle threshold; DCt = Ct of the test
mRNA Ct of h-actin; DDCt = DCt DCt of the calibrator (vehicle-treated
sample)] observed in pR-PIN-NB4 or pR-PIN-HL-60 and the appropriate
pR-NB4 or pR-HL-60 controls. The following amplimers were used for
the amplification of PXN: 5¶-CATGTACGTCCCCACGAACTG-3¶ (nucleotide
2025–2045 of the PXN cDNA); 5¶-CACTGCTGAAATATGAGGAAGAGATG-3¶
(complementary to nucleotide 2072–2095 of the PXN cDNA). The sequence
of the h-actin mRNA amplimers is as published (38).
Pin1 silencing in NB4 and HL-60 cells. To generate polyclonal
populations of NB4 and HL-60 cells silenced for Pin1, the two cell lines
were electroporated with a plasmid construct containing a short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) targeting the peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase (32). All the comparisons were made with the same cell lines transfected with void plasmids.
However, comparative experiments on the ATRA-dependent expression of
several myeloid markers were also performed in NB4 cells transfected with
an irrelevant shRNA (targeting h-glactosidase) to rule out off-target effects of
the Pin1 targeting shRNA (data not shown and Fig. 4A). Cell populations
with stable expression of the shRNA or control plasmid were selected in
RPMI 1640 complete medium containing 50 Ag/mL puromycin (Sigma).

Results
Direct and ligand-independent interaction of Pin1 with
RARA or PML-RARA. To study the interaction of Pin1 with RARa
and PML-RARa, COS-7 cells were transfected with the
corresponding cDNAs and treated with either vehicle or ATRA
(1 Amol/L) for 2 hours. Pull-down experiments were performed
with a GST-Pin1 fusion protein or a GST negative control (Fig. 1A).
RARa and PML-RARa bound to Pin1 in the absence of ATRA. The
binding did not seem to be significantly influenced by the retinoid.
To confirm the interaction between RARa and Pin1, immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to Western blot analyses with antiPin1 and anti-RARa antibodies were performed (Fig. 1B). In cells
forced to express Pin1, similar amounts of the peptidyl-prolylisomerase were recovered in anti-Pin1 immunoprecipitates
obtained after treatment with vehicle and ATRA, whereas small
amounts of endogenous RARa were coprecipitated in either
condition and were visible only upon extended exposure of the
blot. Significant amounts of RARa were complexed to Pin1 in cells
cotransfected with RARa and Pin1 cDNAs. Treatment of cells with
ATRA had no significant effect on the amount of Pin1 bound to
RARa. Ligand-independent complexing of RARa to Pin1 was
confirmed by mirror experiments involving immunoprecipitation
with an anti-RARa antibody.
Far-Western experiments indicated that the interaction between
Pin1 and RARa is direct and ligand independent (Fig. 1C). Indeed,
a specific band corresponding to the receptor was recognized by
GST-Pin1 after gel electrophoresis of COS-7 cell extracts transfected
with the RARa cDNA, regardless of ATRA treatment. Pin1 binds to
client proteins via a fundamental tyrosine residue (Y23) located
within the WW amino-terminal domain (22, 33). Furthermore,
binding does not require a catalytically active carboxyl-terminal
domain. As expected, substitution of Y23 with an alanine (Y23/A)
suppressed the ability of Pin1 to interact with RARa. In contrast, a
truncated version of Pin1 corresponding to the entire WW domain
or a catalytically inactive version of the protein (C113/A)
maintained the ability to interact with RARa. Further support for
a direct interaction was provided by the observation that the GSTPin1 WW domain bound to in vitro translated RARa. Binding
required phosphorylation of RARa (39), afforded by preincubation
with recombinant ERK1, which phosphorylates the same consensus sequences recognized by Pin1 (40).
The ligand-independent interaction between RARa or PMLRARa and Pin1 was substantiated in the retinoid-sensitive AMLderived HL-60 and APL-derived NB4 cell lines (Fig. 1D). Similar
levels of RARa could be immunoprecipitated by anti-Pin1 antibodies from extracts of HL-60 cells treated with vehicle or ATRA
for 2 hours. By the same token, equivalent amounts of Pin1 were
immunoprecipitated with anti-RARa antibodies regardless of the
presence of ATRA in the culture medium at both 2 and 24 hours. In
NB4 cells, not only RARa but also PML-RARa was coprecipitated
by anti-Pin1 antibodies. Even in this cell line, the interaction
between RARa or PML-RARa and Pin1 was supported by mirror
experiments performed with the anti-RARa antibodies. As
observed in the case of HL-60 blasts, treatment of NB4 cells with
ATRA did not result in significant changes in the ability of Pin1 to
interact with either retinoic acid receptor. Interestingly, Pin1 was
identified in the transcriptional complexes bound to functional
RAREs of the two direct retinoid-responsive genes, CD38
(Supplementary Fig. S1) and RARb (data not shown), both in
the absence and presence of ATRA. This was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays performed with anti-Pin1 and

Figure 1. Interaction between Pin1 and RARa or PML-RARa. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with RARa (0.1 Ag) or PML-RARa (0.1 Ag) and treated with vehicle
(DMSO) or ATRA (1 Amol/L) for 2 h. Cell extracts were pulled down with GST-Pin1 immobilized on Sepharose beads or the GST-negative control. Precipitated
proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-RARa (top two panels ) and anti-GST tag (bottom panel ) antibodies. The input of PML-RARa and RARa
present in transfected COS-7 cells is shown on the left. This corresponds to 1/20th of the material used for the pull-down. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with RARa
(0.1 Ag) and/or Pin1 (0.4 Ag). After treatment for 2 h with ATRA (1 Amol/L), cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Pin1 (IP, left) or anti-RARa (IP, right)
antibodies. The viability of COS-7 cells was >90% in all the experimental conditions. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis (WB ) with anti-RARa
and anti-Pin1 antibodies. C, top panels, Far-Western experiments (FW ) were conducted on extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with RARa (0.5 Ag) treated with
vehicle or ATRA (1 Amol/L) for 2 h. Blots of the extracts were incubated with recombinant WT, WW-domain, Y23/A , and C113/A mutant Pin1 proteins and developed
with anti-Pin1 antibodies. The bottom lanes illustrate the levels of RARa expression, as assessed by Western blotting. Bottom panel, a recombinant RARa protein
was incubated for 20 min in the absence (RARa) or in the presence of recombinant ERK1 to phosphorylate the protein (RARa P). An aliquot of the incubation
mixture was pulled down with a GST-tagged version of the WW domain of Pin1 (GST-WW) immobilized on Sepharose beads or the GST-negative control. Precipitated
proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-RARa antibodies. One tenth of the RARa input is shown on the left. D, HL-60 and NB4 cells treated with
DMSO or ATRA (1 Amol/L) for 2 and/or 24 h. The viability of NB4 and HL-60 cells was >90% in all the experimental conditions. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated
(IP ) with anti-Pin1 and anti-RARa antibodies or the IgG-negative control. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Pin1 or anti-RARa
antibodies. In the case of HL-60, input RARa is not different in extracts of vehicle-treated and ATRA-treated (data not shown) cells. The asterisks indicate a

Pin1 inhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of
RARA or PML-RARA; silencing or pharmacologic inhibition of
Pin1 suppresses the effect. The functional consequences of the
interaction between Pin1 and RARa or PML-RARa were studied in
COS-7 cells (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection of the Pin1 and RARa cDNAs
resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the receptor
transactivation. With 0.4 Amol/L Pin1, inhibition was evident up to
48 hours (data not shown). Similar results were observed if the

controlled by artificial RAREs (DR5-TK-Luc). Equivalent results were
routinely obtained with a similar construct in which the luciferase
was substituted by a chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase (CAT)
reporter (see also Fig. 2B). Inhibition of ATRA-dependent activation
of RARa by Pin1 was also observed with luciferase-based constructs
containing the natural retinoid-responsive promoter of human
RARb2 (ref. 41; data not shown). The specificity of the inhibitory
effect was verified using two siRNAs targeting different regions of

the Pin1 transcript and one siRNA targeting GAPDH as a negative
control (Fig. 2B). Consistent with specific silencing (only siRNA A is
shown; bottom), both Pin1-targeted siRNAs, but not the GAPDH
counterpart, suppressed the inhibitory effect of Pin1 on the
transcriptional activity of RARa. Noticeably, cotransfection of RXRa
did not alter the inhibitory effect afforded by Pin1 on the liganddependent transactivation of RARa (Supplementary Fig. S2A).

Pin1-dependent inhibition of RARa activity requires the
presence of a functionally competent peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase
(Fig. 2C). In line with the observed inability of Pin1Y23/A to
interact with the receptor (Fig. 1C), transfection of COS-7 cells with
the mutant failed to inhibit ligand-dependent transactivation of
RARa. The prolyl-isomerase defective S67/E mutant, which is
functionally equivalent to C113/A, was equally incapable of

inhibiting ATRA-dependent activation of RARa. Interestingly,
pharmacologic inhibition of Pin1 with PiB (42) was sufficient to
cause dose-dependent reversion of the inhibitory effect afforded by
Pin1 overexpression (Fig. 2D).
Pin1 induces ligand-independent degradation of RARA and
PML-RARA by the proteasome pathway. To get insights into the
mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect on RARa and PMLRARa, we compared the levels of the two proteins in COS-7 cells
transfected with Pin1 (Fig. 3A). In the absence of ATRA, Pin1
caused a dose-dependent decrease in the steady-state levels of both
RARa and PML-RARa. As expected, treatment of cells with ATRA
induced degradation and, consequently, a net decrease of the
steady-state levels of the two receptors (15, 43). As ATRAdependent degradation of RARa and PML-RARa was already
maximal, overexpression of Pin1 did not cause any additional

effect. Silencing of Pin1 with a specific siRNA increased the basal
levels of RARa observed in COS-7 cells transfected with Pin1
(Fig. 3B, left), confirming the specificity of the effect. There was a
strict correlation between the action exerted by Pin1 on the steadystate levels of RARa and the functional activity of the peptidylprolyl-isomerase. First, Y23/A was equally unable to decrease the
levels of RARa (Fig. 3B, right), interact with the receptor (see
Fig. 1C), and inhibit ATRA-dependent RARa transactivation
(Fig. 2C). Second, the catalytically inactive S67/E protein did not
alter the levels (Fig. 3B, right) or affect the transcriptional activity of
RARa (Fig. 2C). Third, treatment of Pin1- and PML-RARa–, or
RARa-transfected COS-7 cells with PiB partially reverted the downmodulation of the two retinoid receptors afforded by overexpression of the peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase (Fig. 3C). All these effects were
independent of the presence of ATRA in the culture medium.

The decrease in RARa levels caused by Pin1 overexpression was
due to proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein (Fig. 3D),
because the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, reverted this effect. As
expected (44), MG132 exerted a protective effect also in the case of
ATRA-induced RARa degradation, regardless of Pin1 overexpression. Degradation of RARa is likely to be an important mechanism
for the inhibitory effect exerted by Pin1 on ATRA-dependent
transactivation of the receptor (Fig. 3D, bar graph). Indeed,
treatment with MG132 of Pin1-transfected cells resulted in
functional recovery of RARa. The same phenomena were observed
if RARa was substituted for by PML-RARa (data not shown).
Interestingly, Pin1 overexpression had no significant effect on the
levels of the RAR partner protein RXR (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Silencing of Pin1 causes stabilization of RARA/PML-RARA
and sensitization of NB4 and HL-60 cells to ATRA. To establish
the physiologic significance of Pin1 for the retinoid pathway, we
silenced the corresponding gene in NB4 and HL-60 cells by
electroporating a plasmid containing a shRNA targeting Pin1. Two
stably transfected populations for each cell line were obtained: one
expressing the specific shRNA (pR-PIN-NB4 or pR-PIN-HL-60) and
the other expressing the void vector (pR-NB4 or pR-HL-60). pR-NB4
and pR-HL-60 expressed levels of Pin1 comparable with those

observed in the corresponding parental cell lines (data not shown).
Efficient silencing of Pin1 (>75% reduction in the levels of Pin1
protein) was observed in both control and ATRA-treated pR-PINNB4 and pR-PIN-HL-60 cells (Fig. 4A).
In basal conditions, suppression of Pin1 was accompanied by a
significant elevation in the steady-state levels of RARa in both pRPIN-NB4 and pR-PIN-HL-60 cells (Fig. 4A). Increased amounts of
the protein in pR-PIN-NB4 and pR-PIN-HL-60 relative to pR-NB4
and pR-HL-60 cells were observed also after challenge with ATRA
(0.1 Amol/L) for 24 hours. A similar effect occurred with the PMLRARa protein expressed in pR-PIN-NB4 cells. No differences in the
amounts of RARa and/or PML-RARa transcripts were observed in
Pin1 silenced and control cell lines (data not shown). This is
consistent with what was observed in COS-7 cells and suggests that
suppression of Pin1 slows down constitutive degradation of RARa/
PML-RARa. As expected, only residual binding of RARa to Pin1 was
detected in pR-PIN-HL-60 cells, after immunoprecipitation with
anti-Pin1 and/or anti-RARa antibodies (data not shown), supporting the specificity of the interaction between the two proteins.
Pin1 knockdown resulted in sensitization of NB4 and HL-60 cells
to ATRA by a number of complementary experiments. As shown in
Fig. 4A, relative to what is observed in the absence of the silencing

oligonucleotide, transfection of an anti-Pin1 siRNA in WT or pRLacZ-NB4 (stably transfected with an irrelevant shRNA targeting
bacterial h-galactosidase) cells along with DR5-TK-Luc resulted in
enhanced ligand-dependent transcription of the RARE-containing
reporter. Moreover, comparison of shRNA-silenced pR-PIN-NB4
with WT or pR-LacZ-NB4 cells showed a significant increase of
the ATRA-induced activation of the luciferase reporter. Finally,
transfection of the siRNA targeting Pin1 in pR-PIN-NB4 cells
resulted in minor increases in ATRA-dependent luciferase activity,
consistent with almost maximal silencing of Pin1 by stable
expression of the specific shRNA. A similar trend of results was
observed after conducting the same type of experiments in the
HL-60 model (data not shown).
Our results were supported by analysis of the ligand-dependent
transcription of selected retinoid-dependent genes (Fig. 4B). Four
direct retinoid-target genes (RARb2, Egr1, PXN, and CYP26A),
containing functional RAREs were tested for their response to
ATRA (0.1 Amol/L) in pR-NB4/pR-PIN-NB4 or pR-HL-60/pR-PIN-HL60 cells, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Although quantitative differences in ATRA-dependent induction of RARb2, Egr1, and
PXN mRNAs were noticeable, pR-PIN-NB4 and pR-PIN-HL-60
responded to ATRA with a more robust increase in the amounts
of the three transcripts than the corresponding control cells. CYP26
was much more inducible by ATRA in pR-PIN-NB4 than in pR-NB4
cells, whereas the effect was less significant in the pR-PIN-HL-60/
pR-HL-60 couple. In addition, we evaluated the effect of Pin1
silencing on cEBPh and STAT-1, two proteins encoding transcription factors involved in the process of granulocytic maturation
activated by ATRA (31). Even in this case, Pin1 down-regulation
enhanced ATRA-dependent induction of the two proteins in both
NB4 and HL-60 cells.
One of the functional consequences of cellular sensitization to
retinoids by Pin1 silencing was enhanced myeloid maturation
(Supplementary Fig. S3), as indicated by the differentiation markers
NBT reductase, CD11b, CD11c, and CD38 (11). Augmented NBT
reductase activity was observed in pR-PIN-NB4 relative to pR-NB4
cells treated for 4 days with increasing concentrations of ATRA. A
similar effect occurred in the pR-PIN-HL-60/pR-HL-60 couple, when
the number of NBT reductase–positive cells was considered.
Although a dose-dependent enhancement of NBT reductase was
observed with concentrations of ATRA ranging from 0.1 to
10 Amol/L in pR-PIN-NB4, the effect was already maximal at
0.01 Amol/L ATRA in the pR-PIN-HL-60 counterpart. Relative to the
corresponding control, increases in the number of CD11b- and
CD11c-positive pR-PIN-NB4 cells were caused only by the lowest
concentration of ATRA. Significant elevations of cell-associated
CD11c [mean-associated fluorescence (MAF)] were evident in pRPIN-NB4 cells treated with 0.01 Amol/L ATRA or higher. In the PINHL-60/pR-HL-60 couple, Pin1 silencing caused an increase in the
number of CD11b-positive cells and in the amount of CD11b
expression (MAF) only after treatment with 0.01 Amol/L ATRA. As
to CD11c, the two parameters were elevated with all concentrations of ATRA. Although the vast majority of NB4 cells was CD38
positive, Pin1 silencing increased the amount of cell-associated
CD38 (MAF) already at 0.01 Amol/L ATRA. A similar effect was not
observed in the context of HL-60 cells.
Interestingly, a substantial proportion of pR-PIN-HL-60 cells
expressed both CD11b and CD11c in basal conditions, suggesting a
more differentiated phenotype. A similar, albeit quantitatively
lower, effect was observed with CD11c in pR-PIN-NB4. Because all
the experiments described were conducted in complete medium,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

expression of myeloid markers in the absence of added ATRA can
be explained by sensitization to endogenous serum retinoids
(generally 0.001–0.005 Amol/L).
The effect of Pin1 silencing on the growth inhibitory action of
ATRA is complex. In fact, silencing was associated with a
significant decrease in the basal growth rate of NB4 (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and HL-605 cells, which complicated the interpretations of the data obtained after challenge with ATRA.
Nevertheless, the data obtained in pR-PIN-NB4 cells indicate that
Pin1 down-modulation enhances the growth inhibitory response
to ATRA after short exposure to suboptimal concentrations of the
retinoid (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Notably, the antiproliferative
effect exerted by ATRA in pR-PIN-NB4 cells was not associated
with evident signs of apoptosis up until 4 days of treatment.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Pin1 by PiB stabilizes RARa or
PML-RARa and sensitizes myeloid leukemia cells to retinoids.
To establish whether inhibition of Pin1 catalytic activity was
equivalent to silencing of the corresponding gene, we performed
combination studies in NB4 and HL-60 cells with PiB and ATRA. In
NB4 cells, cotreatment with PiB and ATRA was more effective than
ATRA alone in inducing the expression of the EGR-1 and PXN
genes (Fig. 5A), indicating sensitization. Sensitization was not
limited to NB4 and extended to HL-60 cells (Fig. 5B) as well as to
other targets of retinoid activity like cEBPh and total or tyrosinephosphorylated STAT-1 (ref. 31; Supplementary Fig. S5). PiB was
just potentiating the differentiating activity of ATRA, as the
compound, on its own, was devoid of any modulating action on
the expression of the retinoid-dependent markers considered.
Increased responsiveness to ATRA translated into augmented
granulocytic differentiation of both the NB4 and HL-60 blasts
(Fig. 5A and B). Combined treatment with PiB and ATRA induced
the appearance of a greater number of NBT reductase–positive NB4
and HL-60 cells relative to treatment with ATRA alone. A similar
effect was observed in PR-9 cells after conditional expression of
PML-RARa (Supplementary Fig. S6C). The combination of PiB+ATRA was also more efficient than the single components in
increasing surface expression of CD11b and CD11c in both NB4
and HL-60 cells (Fig. 5A and B).
Treatment of NB4 cells with PiB potentiated not only the
differentiating but also the antiproliferative action exerted by
ATRA (Fig. 5A). Indeed, whereas PiB alone had no significant effect
on the growth of this cell line, treatment with the Pin1 inhibitor
and ATRA (0.01 and 1 Amol/L) enhanced the antiproliferative effect
of the retinoid. Noticeably, enhancement was evident after 3 and 4
days of continuous cotreatment even at the lowest concentration
of ATRA, which, on its own, had only a marginal antiproliferative
effect. Increased growth inhibition by the combination of PiB and
ATRA was associated with an increase in the proportion of cells in
the G1 phase and a parallel decrease in the proportion of cells
transiting through the S phase of the cycle (Supplementary Fig. S7).
A slightly different situation was observed in the HL-60 model
(Fig. 5B). Monotreatment of HL-60 cells with PiB or ATRA for
4 days resulted in a similar and sustained growth-inhibitory action.
Once again, combinations between PiB and ATRA enhanced the
growth-inhibitory effects observed with either compound. Interestingly, a synergistic interaction between PiB and ATRA in terms
of growth inhibition was observed also in PR9 cells expressing
PML-RARa (Supplementary Fig. S6D).

Figure 5. Effects of Pin1 inhibition by PiB in NB4 and HL-60 cells. A and B, NB4 and HL-60 cells (150,000/mL) were treated with the indicated concentrations of
PiB and/or ATRA for 4 d, unless otherwise stated. The amounts of EGR-1 and PXN transcripts (A, top left ) were measured by real-time RT-PCR as in Fig. 4B.
Columns, mean of two independent cell cultures; bars, SD. The number of NBT reductase–positive cells was also determined (A and B, bottom left ). An aliquot of the
same cell populations was also subjected to FACS analysis for the indicated surface markers. The percentage of CD11b-positive cells and the amount of cell-associated
CD11c (MAF ) are shown by the bar graphs (A and B ). Conversely, the numbers in parenthesis represent the MAF (CD11b) and percentage of positive cells
(CD11c). The number of viable cells (A and B, bottom right ) was counted manually after staining with trypan blue following treatment for 1 to 4 d in the case of NB4 cells
and only 4 d in the case of HL-60 cells. In these experimental conditions, the viability of cells is z90% in all cases. C, right and left, NB4 and HL-60 cells were treated
for 24 h as indicated. Western blots of RARa and h-actin are shown. All the results are representative of at least two experiments.

Sensitization to retinoids by PiB required the presence of a
functionally active retinoid signaling pathway (Supplementary
Fig. S8A and B). Indeed, the two retinoid-resistant cell lines, HL60R, expressing an inactive form of RARa, and NB4.007, showing
constitutive degradation of PML-RARa (28, 45), were substantially
refractory to PiB and/or ATRA, both in terms of NBT reductase
activity and growth inhibition.
Relative to vehicle-treated cells, treatment of NB4 cells (Fig. 5C)
for 24 hours with PiB caused significant increases in the basal
levels of PML-RARa and a more limited effect on RARa. PiB
protected cells from ATRA-induced degradation of the two
receptors as well. Similar phenomena involving RARa were
observed in HL-60 blasts treated with PiB alone or in combination
with ATRA (Fig. 5C). Protection of ATRA-induced PML-RARa

degradation by Pin1 inhibition was also verified in the PR9 cell line
after expression of PML-RARa (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B).
PiB sensitizes freshly isolated AML blasts to ATRA. The effect
of PiB was studied in blasts isolated from AML patients whose
characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For
these studies, the same differentiation markers used for HL-60 and
NB4 cells were considered.
The first patient was characterized by expression of Pin1, which
was not modulated by ATRA alone or in combination with PiB
(Fig. 6A). Treatment for 4 days with ATRA (0.1 Amol/L) increased
the number of CD11b-positive cells and induced the amount of
cell-associated CD11c or CD38 observed in control conditions. At
higher concentrations (1 Amol/L), ATRA induced also STAT-1.
Although devoid of any activity on its own, PiB (1 Amol/L)

potentiated the effects exerted by ATRA on CD11b, CD11c, and, to
a lesser extent, on CD38. Although PiB enhanced retinoiddependent induction of STAT-1, the effect was just additive, as
up-regulation of the protein was already observed in cells treated
with PiB alone. Interestingly, PiB protected AML blasts from ATRAinduced degradation of RARa. This supports the concept that at
least part of the potentiating effect of Pin1 inhibition is explained
by stabilization of the retinoid receptor.
The induction of the two retinoid-dependent transcription
factors, cEBPh and STAT1, was observed in the blasts of patient
2 after incubation for 4 days with the combination of PiB and
ATRA (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, PiB, ATRA, and
combinations thereof did not affect the levels of NBT reductase,
CD11b, CD11c, or CD38 (data not shown). PiB and ATRA alone or
in combination had no effect on Pin1 expression. In the APL
patient 3, whose blasts express similar levels of Pin1 as patient 1
(Supplementary Fig. S9), PiB enhanced ATRA-dependent induction
of NBT reductase activity (Fig. 6B). In both vehicle- and ATRAtreated cells, Pin1 treatment was associated with an increase in
the steady-state levels of PML-RARa and RARa (Fig. 6B).

In patient 4, PiB potentiated all the retinoid-dependent responses
considered (Fig. 6C). Indeed, the inhibitor enhanced the induction
of NBT reductase, CD11b, and CD11c afforded by treatment for
5 days with two concentrations of ATRA (0.1 and 1 Amol/L). A
similar effect was observed after 1 and 5 days of treatment in the
case of cEBPh and STAT-1. All these PiB-dependent effects were
accompanied by protection from ATRA-induced degradation of
RARa. In the case of patient 5, combinations of PiB (1 Amol/L) and
ATRA (1 Amol/L) were more effective than the single compounds in
increasing the number of CD11c-positive cells and in inducing the
expression of cEBPh or STAT-1 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Interestingly, patient 6, representing an evolution of a CMML to AML, was
associated with complete refractoriness to ATRA and consequently
to PiB as well (data not shown).

Discussion
The results of this report indicate that Pin1 is a component of
the transcriptional complex containing RARa, the major retinoid
receptor expressed in the myeloid lineage. Pin1 binds to the

Pin1 Is a Negative Regulator of RARa

unliganded form of the receptor directly and binding is not
influenced by ATRA. PML-RARa, the aberrant form of the receptor
expressed in APL blasts, retains the ability to interact with Pin1.
Interaction with Pin1 requires phosphorylation of RARa, and most
likely of PML-RARa too. Several phosphorylated Ser(Thr)-Pro
motifs potentially involved in the binding to Pin1 are present
throughout the sequence of RARa and PML-RARa. We are in the
process of mapping the critical residues responsible for the
interaction with the peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase, using phosphorylation mutants and deletions of RARa and PML-RARa. Interestingly,
it was recently shown that PML (46) is a client protein of Pin1,
hence it is likely that not only the RARa but also the PML moiety
of PML-RARa is important for the binding to the peptidyl-prolylisomerase. Because the interaction between RARa/PML-RARa and
Pin1 is ligand independent, crucial phosphorylation sites must be
targets of constitutive kinases acting on the unliganded form of
the receptors (39). As to the other partner in this interaction,
the WW domain of Pin1, which lies upstream of the peptidylprolyl-isomerase catalytic region, is necessary and sufficient for
the binding to RARa and PML-RARa. Within this domain, the
Y/23 residue is critical for the interaction with either retinoid
receptor (33).
Pin1 is a negative regulator of RARa functional activity. Our data
are consistent with the idea that the interaction with Pin1 is
instrumental in routing unliganded RARa and/or PML-RARa along
the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. We propose that
Pin1 lies upstream of the ubiquitination machinery,5 inducing
conformational changes to RARa that make the receptor accessible
to the ubiqutin ligase/transferase complex and subsequent
proteosome-dependent degradation. Although Pin1 is not directly
involved in the ligand-dependent degradation of RARa or PMLRARa, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase affects the process indirectly.
Indeed, silencing or inhibition of Pin1 causes an increase in the
steady-state levels of both receptors not only in basal conditions
but also after treatment of NB4 and HL-60 cells with ATRA.
Although we cannot rule out modification of other Pin1-dependent
cellular effects by silencing/inhibition of the peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase, stabilization of RARa and/or PML-RARa may be at
the basis of the differences in the response to retinoids observed in
the AML-derived HL-60 or NB4 cell lines and in freshly isolated
AML blasts. Indeed, constitutive silencing of Pin1 causes enhanced
expression of various retinoid-regulated genes, as well as a more
rapid and sustained differentiating response to the retinoid. We
propose that this is the direct consequence of a net increase of
the RARa and/or PML-RARa pool(s), which is susceptible to be
activated by ATRA.
RARa stabilization by Pin1 silencing/inhibition and consequent
increases in the steady-state levels of the protein may entirely
explain the observed potentiation of ATRA-dependent differentiation and/or growth inhibition in AML cellular contexts lacking
PML-RARa. Conversely, the observation that enhanced differentiation of the APL blast is associated with stabilization not only of
RARa but also of PML-RARa challenges the mainstream views on
the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the leukemic
cell to ATRA, as the aberrant receptor is generally considered to be
a suppressor of the retinoid-dependent network of genes. However,
a number of considerations are relevant in this context. The results
obtained after Pin1 silencing/inhibition are not the first instance in
which stabilization of PML-RARa is associated with increased
sensitivity of APL cells to retinoid-induced differentiation. In fact,
we reported the same type of observation also after cotreatment of

www.aacrjournals.org

NB4 cells with STI571/Gleevec (6). In reference to this, there are
a number of indirect pieces of evidence indicating that the
responsiveness of APL blasts to the cytodifferentiating activity of
ATRA and/or other retinoids may involve transcriptional activation
of PML-RARa. First, PML-RARa is an efficient ligand-dependent
transcriptional activator of several retinoid-dependent genes, in
addition to exerting suppressive effects on RARa activity. Second,
PLZF-RARa, another fusion protein present in a minority of ATRArefractory APL cases, retains a suppressive action on RARa, but
is largely devoid of ligand-dependent transcriptional activity on
RARE-containing target genes. Third, overexpression of PMLRARa, but not PLZF-RARa, induces retinoid responsiveness in the
U937 AML cell line (47). Finally, it must be considered that
mutations in the ligand-binding site of PML-RARa knock down the
transactivating properties of the receptor and are associated with
resistance to the retinoid in relapsed APL patients (48). Taken
together, these data suggest that the differentiating effect of ATRA
on APL cells may not simply be explained by relief of the
suppressive action of PML-RARa on the retinoid-dependent
pathway. Hence, the beneficial effect of ATRA may also involve
an active participation of PML-RARa, functioning as a liganddependent transcriptional activator of retinoid-dependent genes
important for the granulocytic maturation of the APL blast. Clearly,
we are not purporting the idea that stabilization of PML-RARa is
the only mechanism at work in our APL-derived experimental
paradigms. It is possible that Pin1 silencing or inhibition causes
structural alterations of PML-RARa affecting not only its
proteasome-dependent degradation but also its ligand-dependent
transactivaton. These structural changes may enhance the
transcriptional activity of the aberrant receptor, perhaps by
destabilization of the interactions with corepressor proteins, and
result in the potentiation/sensitization effects observed in NB4
and freshly isolated APL blasts.
Although differences in the modulation of single response
markers are observed, general sensitization of NB4 and HL-60 cells
to the differentiating action of ATRA is similar after silencing and
pharmacologic inhibition of Pin1 with PiB. Indeed, combined
treatment of NB4 and HL-60 cells with PiB and ATRA is associated
with enhanced expression of the same retinoid-regulated myeloid
transcription factors and markers targeted by Pin1 silencing.
Pharmacologic combinations of PiB and ATRA are more effective
than ATRA alone not only in the context of the retinoid-responsive
NB4 and HL-60 cells but also in freshly isolated blasts of patients
representing AML subtypes classified as M1 to M4. If this is
expected in the case of the APL patient considered, the observation
is very interesting and of potential therapeutic relevance in the
other AML subtypes. In fact, our data indicate that Pin1 inhibition
can boost the expression of a number of molecular determinants
and markers of myeloid differentiation typically modulated by
ATRA in AML cell types that are only partially responsive to the
differentiating action of retinoids. It would be interesting to extend
the number of AML patients analyzed to establish whether Pin1
targeting is more effective in potentiating the activity of ATRA in
cases showing mutations of the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) protein,
as the normal protein has been reported to act as a repressor of the
retinoid signaling pathway (49).
In conclusion, beyond their significance at the basic level, the
data contained in this report represent proof of principle that
down-modulation of Pin1 activity is a viable strategy to increase
the differentiating and antiproliferative activity of ATRA in APL
and other types of AML.
