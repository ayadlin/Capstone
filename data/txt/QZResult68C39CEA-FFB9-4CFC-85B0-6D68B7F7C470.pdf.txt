ABSTRACT
The present study evaluated whether flurbiprofen increased the naturally
circulating dendritic cells (DCs) subsets in patients with esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing esophageal resection. Compared to healthy donors
(n=20), the significantly depressed percentages of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), CD1c+
myeloid DCs (mDCs), and CD141+ mDCs among ESCC patients (n=60) were confirmed.
Flurbiprofen was administered before skin incision and at the end of operation in
group F (n=30), as well as placebo in group C (n=30). The postoperative suppressed
percentages of pDCs, CD1c+ mDCs, and CD141+ mDCs increased significantly following
the perioperative treatment with flurbiprofen. Flurbiprofen also significantly stimulated
the postoperative IFN-f and IL-17 production, but inhibited the immunosuppressive
IL-10 and TGF-β levels. Furthermore, flurbiprofen exerted a similar analgesic effect
and brought a significantly less sufentanil consumption compared to group C. Taken
together, flurbiprofen provided a short-term increase of postoperative naturally
circulating DCs in ESCC patients.

anti-tumor immunity, particularly in T cell subsets and
associated cytokines-dependent anti-tumor immunity
[5, 6]. In the present study, we investigated whether
flurbiprofen increased postoperative naturally circulating
DCs subsets in patients with esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing esophageal radical
resection.

INTRODUCTION
Despite rare occurrence among peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), naturally circulating
dendritic cells (DCs) display a strikingly strong ability
in taking up, processing, and presenting pathogens or
tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to stimulate naive T
cells and to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or
helper 1 T cells (Th1)/Th17 polarization [1, 2]. Recently,
a novel DCs-based vaccination strategy, which employed
enriched naturally circulating DCs directly isolated from
PBMCs, showed a impressive clinical efficacy in patients
with prostate cancer and melanoma, strongly suggesting
a potent ability of naturally circulating DCs to induce the
specific anti-cancer CTLs and Th1/Th17 response [3, 4].
The perioperative treatment with cyclooxygenase (COX)
inhibitors, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), not only alleviate postoperative pain and
reduce opioid analgesics consumption, but also enhance

RESULTS
Naturally circulating DCs subsets in healthy
donors and ESCC patients
Traditionally, circulating DCs among PBMCs was
detected by characterization of negative for lineage (Lin)
markers (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD56) and positive
for HLA-DR. The Lin- HLA-DR+ cells can be further
subdivided into mDCs and pDCs by the expression of
CD11c and CD123, respectively. Recently, some novel

mDCs (Lin- CD11c+ CD1c+), CD16+ mDCs (Lin- CD11c+
CD16+), and CD141+ mDCs (Lin- CD11c+ CD141+), among
naturally circulating mDCs (Lin- HLA-DR+ CD11c+) were
reported [1, 2]. The percentages of CD1c+ mDCs, CD16+
mDCs, CD141+ mDCs and CD123+ pDCs among PBMCs
in healthy donors and ESCC patients were preoperatively
(pre-OP) evaluated by fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) and depicted as the histogram (Figure
1a). Specifically, CD1c+ mDCs (Figure 1c), CD141+
mDCs (Figure 1e) and CD123+ pDCs (Figure 1f) were
significantly suppressed compared to the healthy controls.
But except for CD16+ mDCs, CD16+ mDCs percentage in
ESCC patients was similar with healthy control (Figure 1d).

In group C, the percentages of pDCs and three mDCs
subtypes at post-OP 24h were significantly depressed
compared to pre-OP baseline levels, and no significant
difference in the four DCs subsets percentage between
post-OP 48h and pre-OP baseline levels. Comparing to
group C, the percentages of CD1c+ mDCs (Figure 2e),
CD141+ mDCs (Figure 2g) and CD123+ pDCs (Figure 2h)
at post-OP 24h were up-regulated significantly in group
F after perioperative treatment with flurbiprofen, except
for CD16+ mDCs (Figure 2f). At following post-OP 48h,
the four DCs subsets percentage between group F and
group C did not show a significant change. In group F,
the percentages of CD1c+ mDCs (Figure 2a) and CD141+
mDCs (Figure 2c) at post-OP 24h were significantly
increased compared to pre-OP baseline levels, and the
percentages of CD16+ mDCs (Figure 2b) and CD123+
pDCs (Figure 2d) at post-OP 24h were significantly
suppressed compared to pre-OP baseline levels, and the
four DCs subsets percentage returned to pre-OP baseline
levels at post-OP 48h.

Flurbiprofen increased postoperative circulating
DCs subsets in patients
The percentages of pDCs and mDCs subtypes
among PBMCs from patients were determined by FACS
at postoperatively (post-OP) 24h and 48h, respectively.

Flurbiprofen promoted the postoperative antitumor cytokine profile

group F (Figure 3e). The opioid analgesics sufentanil
consumption during post-OP 24h in group F was
significantly less than group C (Figure 3f). The incidence
of nausea/vomiting between group C and group F did not
show a significant change (data not shown).

In group C, the cancer-inhibitory cytokine IFN-γ
and Th17-associated IL-17 production were significantly
suppressed at post-OP 48h compared to pre-OP baseline
levels (Figure 3a, 3c). Yet the immunosuppressive
cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β levels at post-OP 48h were
significantly higher than pre-OP baseline levels in group
C (Figure 3b, 3d). Notably, flurbiprofen significantly
increased anti-cancer IFN-γ and IL-17 levels at post-OP
48h in group F (Figure 3a, 3c). Accordingly, IL-10 and
TGF-β levels at post-OP 48h were depressed significantly
in patients from group F following perioperative treatment
with flurbiprofen (Figure 3b, 3d).

DISCUSSION
Previously, not only numerical defective of
circulating DCs and tumor-infiltrating DCs in tissue
specimen, but also functional impairment of monocytederived DCs (moDCs) from the peripheral blood was
reported in patients with esophageal and other tumors
[7–10]. In the present study, FACS results showed that
CD1c+ mDCs represented by far the most predominant
mDCs subset (0.35±0.07%, Figure 1c) in the healthy
donors (except for CD16+ mDCs), whereas CD141+ mDCs
(0.14±0.02%, Figure 1e) formed a minute population.
Specifically, CD1c+ mDCs and CD141+ mDCs can be
activated by a distinct set of toll-like receptors (TLRs),
and subsequently secrete large amounts of cytokines IFN-γ

Flurbiprofen brought a similar analgesia and
less sufentanil consumption
During post-OP 48h patient-controlled intravenous
analgesia (PCIA), there was no significant difference in
visual analogue scale (VAS) scores between group C and

and IL-12 which allow the highly effective induction of
CTLs and Th1 responses against tumor [11, 12]. In line
with the defective quantification of DCs in esophageal
carcinoma, FACS results in the present study displayed
that the percentages of CD1c+ mDCs, and CD141+ mDCs
among PBMCs in ESCC patients were significantly lower
than healthy controls. However, the similar percentages
of CD16+ mDCs subset, considered to be more monocytelike, among PBMCs were identified in healthy donors
and ESCC patients. Besides mDCs, pDCs are specialized
in the detection and control of viral infections, as well

as prime both Th1 and CTLs by the strong release of
IFN-γ in an IL-12-independent Th1 polarization [13,
14]. Moreover, several studies demonstrated that despite
lower antigen uptake and limited phagocytosis than mDCs
subsets, pDCs isolated from blood and spleen were shown
to efficiently cross-present antigens and prime potent
tumor-specific CTLs [15–17]. Thus, pDCs, as well as
CD1c+ mDCs, represent a promising target in DCs-based
vaccine immunotherapy for cancer. But unfortunately,
similar to CD1c+ mDCs, the FACS results showed that
pDCs percentage (0.26±0.04%, Figure 1f) among PBMCs

from ESCC patients was also significantly depressed
compared to healthy control (0.42±0.06%, Figure 1f).
The COX-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a wellknown tumor-sustaining inflammatory mediator, greatly
contributes to tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, metastasis in
malignances through successful evasion of tumor immune
surveillance and resistance to cancer immunotherapy
[18–20]. A growing amount of information supports that
tumor-derived PGE2 specifically exerts a suppressive
effect on DCs biology through a paracrine and/or
autocrine manner, which reduces the maturation of DCs
and their expression of MHC class II molecules, ability to
present TAAs and prime anti-tumor T cells, possibly via
enhancing the production of immunosuppressive IL-10
[21–23]. Although data not shown in the present study,
the previous researches demonstrated that the surgery
operations significantly induced the over-production
of PGE2 perioperatively, which greatly contributed to
further disruption of the impaired immune function of
cancer patients [24, 25]. In the present study, FACS and
ELISA results showed that the postoperative naturally
circulating DCs subtypes and anti-tumor cytokines profile
were markedly decreased mainly due to the surgical
trauma and pain-induced the immune suppression
via immunosuppressive mediators release, such as
PGE2, IL-10, TGF-β. Subsequently, these naturally
circulating DCs subtypes returned to pre-OP baseline
levels shortly after post-OP 48h, possibly related to
opioid analgesics usage for alleviating the postoperative
pain and/or limited life expectancy of circulating DCs.
Given the immunosuppressive role of PGE2 in cancer
progression, a series of researches have provided
evidence on the clinical beneficial of NSAIDs which
inhibit increased COX activity and PGE2 production on
tumor progression, particularly in a remarkable synergy
between NSAIDs and CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade
immunotherapy results in tumor eradication [20, 26,
27]. Accordingly, research found that the preoperative
treatment with NSAIDs (indomethacin or celecoxib)
was enough to increase tumor infiltration and peripheral
blood by seemingly activated immune cells in patients
with colorectal carcinoma and gastric cancer [6, 20, 28].
The tumor-specific COX ablation stimulated tumorinfiltrating CD11c+ MHC-II+ DCs displayed higher levels
of co-stimulatory molecules, and over-production of
PGE2 impaired accumulation of DCs within melanoma
and suppress their activation, including IL-12-producing
activity [20]. In the present study, our results focused on
perioperative treatment with flurbiprofen significantly
up-regulated the postoperative percentages of CD1c+
mDCs, CD141+ mDCs and CD123+ pDCs, as well as
anti-tumor cytokine profile, but this short-term increase
of the postoperative naturally circulating DCs subsets in
flurbiprofen-treated patients didn’t last for post-OP 48h.
This might be explained by the short elimination halflife time of flurbiprofen in plasma (approximately 5.8 h)
[29, 30].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the present study, we preliminarily observed the
perioperative prevalence of naturally circulating DCs
among PBMCs, and assessed the impact of flurbiprofen
on the postoperative naturally circulating DCs percentages
in the ESCC patients. Although, we found that the
postoperative 3-month survive rate of patients between
group F and group C did not show a significant change after
esophageal resection (data not shown), whether the shortterm increase of the circulating DCs subsets in flurbiprofentreated patients effectively provides an improved long-term
prognosis with ESCC patients still needs consistent followup. What’s more, we are currently investigating the effect
of PGE2/flurbiprofen on the function of enriched naturally
circulating DCs ex vivo, such as phagocytic activity, costimulatory molecule expression, antigen presenting ability
and cytokines production. In summary, the present study
provided a better understanding of the anti-tumor role of
naturally circulating DCs and promotion of PGE2 on tumor
immune evasion in esophageal cancer, and suggested that
NSAIDs could be useful additions to potential circulating
DCs-based immune therapy or conventional treatment of
cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The protocol of this study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University and
the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No.ChiCTRIPR-15006482). Written informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. 60 patients with ESCC undergoing
esophageal resection with an American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) status of I-II were enrolled,
as well as 20 age-matched healthy donors. The enrolled
patients, whom met the inclusion criteria in the present
study, ranged in age from 50 to 75 years and weighed
from 45 to 80kg (summarized in Table 1). The exclusion
criteria were as follows: (1) allergy to NSAIDs, (2) blood
coagulation disorder, (3) hepatic or renal dysfunction,
(4) autoimmune disease or acute inflammation, (5)
perioperative blood transfusion, (6) bronchial asthma, (7)
preoperative treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
immunodepressant, or glucocorticoid.

Group and treatments
The ESCC patients were randomly assigned to
either the flurbiprofen treatment group (group F, n=30) or
the control group (group C, n=30). For patients in group F,
flurbiprofen axetil (1mg/kg, i.v., 50mg/5ml, Beijing Tide
Pharmaceutical, China) was administered 15 min before
skin incision and at the end of surgery, respectively. The
placebo (intralipid, Chengdu Huarui Pharmaceutical,
China) was administered at the same time points in
patients from group C. Both two groups were equally
received postoperative PCIA using sufentanil (100μg).

CD123-PE, and respective mouse IgG isotype controls
(Miltenyi, Germany). The absolute counts of pDCs and
three mDC subsets were quantitated as the percentages of
them among PBMCs measuring by Cytomics FC500 Dual
Laser System (Beckman Coulter, US).

General anesthesia was induced with 0.05mg/kg
midazolam, 2mg/kg propofol, 0.4μg/kg sufentanil, and
1.0mg/kg rocuronium. A left double-lumen endobronchial
tube (Mallinckrodt, Ireland) was inserted and confirmed
by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Mechanical ventilation was
performed using an anesthesia machine (S/5 Avance,
Datex-Ohmeda, USA) with tidal volume (VT) ranged in
6-8 ml/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
5cmH2O, and was adjusted to maintain the PETCO2 at 3545mmHg. The inspiratory to expiratory time (I/E) ratio
was 1:2. During the surgery, 50μg/kg/min propofol and
0.1-0.2μg/kg/min remifentanil were target-controlled
infused to maintain anesthesia, and cis-atracurium was
simultaneously given to muscle relaxation.

PCIA clinical assessment
PCIA efficacy was evaluated at post-OP 12h, 24h,
36h, and 48h according to the VAS scores, including: 0
(painless), 1-4 (mild pain), 5-8 (moderate pain), and 9-10
(severe pain). Sufentanil consumption and incidence of
nausea/vomiting during post-OP 48h were recorded.

Statistical analysis
Statistics were analyzed with the SPSS software
(version 16.0). Quantitative data are presented as means
± SD. Significant differences were evaluated by Student's
t-test or ANOVA. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Sample collection and cytokines measurement
Patients blood sample were collected from the
central venous catheters before anesthesia, as well as postOP 24h and 48h. Plasma from venous blood was obtained
by centrifugation (1000×g, 4°C, 5 min) and stored at
-80°C for further analyses. Cytokines IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-17,
TGF-β levels in plasma were determined using the ELISA
kits (R&D, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. PBMCs were separated from peripheral blood
by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in 0.2 ml PBS (4×106/100μl) for further FACS
study.
