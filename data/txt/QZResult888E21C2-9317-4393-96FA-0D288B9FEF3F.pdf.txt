BACKGROUND: Because the long-term toxicity of myeloablative radioimmunotherapy remains a matter of concern,
the authors evaluated the hematopoietic damage and incidence of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute
myelogenous leukemia (sMDS/AML) in patients who received myeloablative doses of the radiolabeled antibody
yttrium-90 (90Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan. METHODS: The occurrence of sMDS/AML was investigated prospectively in
53 elderly patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an autograft after high-dose radioimmunotherapy (HD-RIT) myeloablative conditioning with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. Bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitors and telomere length (TL) also were investigated. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 49 months, 4 patients
developed sMDS/AML at 6 months, 12 months, 27 months, and 36 months after HD-RIT, and the 5-year cumulative
incidence of sMDS/AML was 8.29%. A significant but transient decrease in BM granulocyte-macrophage progenitors
was observed; whereas multilineage, erythroid, and fibroblast progenitors were unaffected. A significant and
persistent shortening of BM TL also was detected. A matched-pair analysis comparing the study patients with
55 NHL patients who underwent autografts after chemotherapy-based myeloablative conditioning demonstrated
a 8.05% 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML. CONCLUSIONS: HD-RIT for patients with NHL was associated
with 1) limited toxicity on hematopoietic progenitors, 2) accelerated TL shortening, and 3) non-negligible incidence
of sMDS/AML, which nevertheless was comparable to the incidence observed in a matched group of patients
who received chemotherapy-based conditioning. Thus, in the current series of elderly patients with NHL, the
C 2011 American
development of sMDS/AML was not influenced substantially by HD-RIT. Cancer 2011;117:5074–84. V

Rituximab-based high-dose (HD) sequential chemotherapy (HDS-CT) followed by myeloablative conditioning
and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an effective and widely used treatment strategy for patients with
relapsed or prognostically unfavorable non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).1,2 Pretransplantation conditioning regimens
usually include myeloablative chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation (TBI).3 However, novel regimens currently are being investigated to reduce hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic toxicity and to overcome age-related and
comorbidity-related restrictions, thereby ultimately enhancing the efficacy and feasibility of ASCT.
The efficacy and good toxicity profile of radiolabeled antibodies prompted the inclusion of these drugs into myeloablative regimens.4-10 Radioimmunoconjugate-containing conditioning combined with chemotherapy has demonstrated
short-term toxicity comparable to that observed after chemotherapy-based conditioning.11-13 Recently, we reported that
myeloablative doses (1.2 mCi/kg) of yttrium-90 (90Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) combined with tandem stem cell

support represent a feasible pretransplantation conditioning regimen with mild-to-moderate, short-term hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.14
Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS)
and acute leukemia (sMDS/AML) are the predominant types of secondary malignancies observed after
HDS-CT and ASCT, and the estimated 5-year cumulative probability of sMDS/AML ranges from 1% to
24% in different series.15-20 The risk of sMDS/AML
includes age and exposure to alkylating agents and
likely is caused by prolonged or repetitive exposure to
cytotoxic drugs as well as the relatively long natural
history of underlying disease.21,22 Whether bone marrow (BM) exposure to high radiation doses because of
radiolabeled antibodies may further increase hematopoietic damage, thereby increasing the risk of sMDS/
AML, remains a matter of concern. Witzig et al
reported on 5 patients with sMDS/AML among 349
patients who had relapsed or refractory NHL treated
with standard-dose (0.4 mCi/kg) 90Y-ibritumomab
tiuxetan.6 More recently, Czuczman et al performed
an extensive evaluation of 746 patients who received
standard-dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and reported
a 2.5% incidence of sMDS/AML after a median follow-up of 4.4 years.23 Likewise, a 5-year cumulative
incidence rate for sMDS/AML of 6.3% was observed
in patients with recurrent disease who received standard-dose 131I-tositumomab.24 A similar incidence of
sMDS/AML was observed in patients who received
myeloablative doses of either iodine-131 (131I)-tositumomab or chemotherapy-based conditioning for recurrent follicular NHL.12
An analysis of hematopoietic reconstitution after
ASCT has demonstrated that there was permanent damage of hematopoietic and stromal progenitor cells.25-27
Moreover, hematopoietic regeneration after ASCT has
been associated with accelerated telomeric shortening
because of increased replicative proliferation during hematopoietic recovery and exposure to HD cytotoxic
drugs.28-31 Recently, Bhatia et al reported that, after
chemotherapy-based conditioning and ASCT, patients
who developed sMDS/AML had a significantly reduced
recovery of committed progenitors and telomere length
(TL) compared with autografted patients who did not
develop sMDS/AML.32
Because the long-term toxicity of 90Y-ibritumomab
tiuxetan at myeloablative doses remains unknown, in this
longitudinal study, we prospectively investigated a cohort
of high-risk patients with NHL who received a rituximab-

based HDS-CT program followed by myeloablative conditioning with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and autograft
with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). The occurrence
of sMDS/AML was monitored along with the incidence
of BM hematopoietic and stromal progenitors and telomere analysis. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of
sMDS/AML in the study group was compared in a
matched-pair analysis with the incidence observed in a
historic group of patients who were underwent autograft
after receiving chemotherapy-based myeloablative
conditioning.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment Plan
Between July 2004 and December 2007, 65 consecutive
patients with refractory, recurrent, or de novo high-risk
NHL received HD radioimmunotherapy (RIT), based
on a single administration of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan
given at 1.2 mCi/kg body weight.33 Fifty-three of 65
patients who had at least a 6-month, continuous complete remission after transplantation were enrolled in this
study. One patient who developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia with inversion of chromosome 16
4 months after transplantation was excluded from the
current analysis, because the cytogenetic abnormality was
detected retrospectively in the leukapheresis collected
before HD-RIT, thus ruling out any causative role of
90
Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan.34
This study was approved by the institutional ethical
committee, and written informed consent was obtained
from each patient. Patients were followed until occurrence
of death, relapse, or development of sMDS/AML. The
histologic diagnosis in the 53 patients was diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (n ¼ 19), Richter syndrome (n ¼ 2),
follicular cell lymphoma (n ¼ 20), mantle cell lymphoma
(n ¼ 8), marginal zone lymphoma (n ¼ 3), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n ¼ 1). Before they received
HD-RIT, all patients received 5 chemotherapy courses,
including 3 cycles of anthracycline-containing or platinum-containing regimens, 1 course of HD cyclophosphamide (4-7 g/m2), and 1 cycle of HD cytarabine (12-24 g/
m2). Mobilized PBSCs were harvested either after HD
cyclophosphamide (n ¼ 9), HD cytarabine (n ¼ 36), or
both (n ¼ 8).35 The 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan dose of
1.2 mCi/kg is myeloablative; therefore, an autograft was
required after HD-RIT. To overcome both short-term
and long-term hematologic toxicity, the autograft
schedule included a ‘‘tandem’’ reinfusion of autologous

PBSCs on Days þ7 and þ14 after HD-RIT.14 Clinical
characteristics of the patients who received HD-RIT are
summarized in Table 1. The series included elderly
patients; indeed, the median age at transplantation was
64 years, and 45% of patients were aged >65 years.
Most patients had received previously treatment; thus, the
median time from diagnosis to HDS-CT with HD-RIT
was 6 years.
Samples for Biologic Monitoring
BM samples were collected before HD-RIT, every
6 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter. In total,
240 BM samples were evaluated, including 51 pretransplantation samples (96% of assessable patients) and
189 post-transplantation samples. Overall, 60% to 100%
of planned samples actually were harvested and analyzed

5076

at each post-transplantation time point. Reasons for
incomplete collection of samples included inadequate
amount of material to perform all tests and patient refusal
to undergo planned examinations. Harvested samples
were analyzed for incidence of hematopoietic and stromal
progenitors, TL, and cytogenetics. In addition, complete
blood counts and disease evaluations with computed
tomography and/or positron emission tomography imaging studies were performed.

Cytogenetic Analysis and sMDS/AML
Assessment
Chromosomal analysis and G-banding were performed
using standard techniques on at least 20 BM metaphases.
The diagnosis of MDS was assessed according to World
Health Organization criteria.36

Multilineage Colony-Forming Unit,
Erythorid Burst-Forming Unit, and
Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Forming
Unit Assay
The assay for committed colony-forming cells (CFCs),
including multilineage colony-forming units (CFU-Mix),
erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), and granulocytemacrophage CFUs (CFU-GM), was carried out as previously described.37 Briefly, from 1  104 to 5  104
mononuclear cells were plated in 35-mm Petri dishes in
cytokine-supplemented, methylcellulose-based medium
(Methocult GF H4034; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Progenitor cell
growth was evaluated according to previously published
criteria.
Fibroblast CFU Assay
Fibroblast CFUs (CFU-F) were assayed according to a
previously described technique.37 Briefly, mononuclear
cells (5  104/mL resuspended in alpha-medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum; 12.5%, volume/volume),
horse serum (12.5%, volume/volume), and freshly dissolved hydrocortisone (106 M) were plated onto 60-mm
Petri dishes. Fibroblastoid cell aggregates of >50 cells
were scored as CFU-F after staining with crystal violet.
TL Analysis
The TL of BM mononuclear cells was assessed by Southern blot analysis, as previously described.30,31 Briefly,
DNA fragments that were obtained after digestion with
Hinf I and Rsa I (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany) were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and
then transferred onto a nylon membrane. The TeloTAGGG TL Assay Kit (Roche Diagnostic) was used for
the hybridization phase according to manufacturer’s
instructions. For each telomere smear, mean terminal
restriction fragment (TRF) lengths and the point of maximum signal intensity defining the highest concentration
of telomere repeats were calculated using Quantity 1 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Herts, United
Kingdom).
Historic Cohort of Matched Pairs
The matched-pair analysis was executed by using a 3-step
strategy. First, patients who received an HDS-CT program followed by a chemotherapy-based myeloablative
conditioning regimen and ASCT were identified as a historic control group from a large lymphoma database.38
Second, patients in the 2 groups were matched for the fol-

lowing risk factors: age, sex, histologic subtype, disease
status at transplantation, and type of grafted PBSCs.
Third and finally, 1 randomly chosen patient from the
historic control group was matched with each HD-RIT
study patient. The comparison of main clinical parameters between the HD-RIT study group and the historic
control group are detailed in Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
Longitudinal measurements of CFU-Mix, BFU-E, CFUGM, CFU-F, and TL were analyzed using linear mixedeffect models to account for the correlation between measurements within the same category. Time was modeled as
the fixed-effect factor variable. Model assumptions were
verified by examining the residual plots. Two-sided P values below the 5% conventional threshold were considered
significant. The cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML was
determined using the Fine and Gray competing risk
regression model39 to identify the effect of risk factors on
the cumulative incidence function for competing risks
data. The Gray test was used to compare the cumulative
incidence curves in the presence of a competing risk
(always defined as death from any cause other than
sMDS). Event times were computed from the date of
autograft, either after HD-RIT or after HD-CT, to the
date of last follow-up assessment for event-free patients.
Data were analyzed as of June 2010 by using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R 2.11.1
(package cmprsk; The R Project for Statistical Computing, Austria, Vienna).

RESULTS
Engraftment and Response to Therapy
After HD-RIT with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, all
patients received 2 PBSC reinfusions with a median of 2
 106 CD34-positive cells/kg (range, 1-3.7  106 CD34positive cells/kg) and 9.3  106 CD34-positive cells/kg
(range, 6.6-26.8 CD34-positive cells/kg) transplanted on
Days þ7 and þ14, respectively. Neutrophil counts
500/lL and platelet counts 20,000/lL were achieved
at a median of 6 days (range, 2-10 days) and 12 days
(range, 7-17 days) after the second PBSC reinfusion,
respectively. Pretransplantation values of hemoglobin,
neutrophils, and platelet counts were within the normal
ranges (Fig. 1). Six months after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, both neutrophil and platelet counts were reduced significantly compared with baseline counts, but complete
and sustained recoveries to baseline values were observed

Month þ12 after transplantation. As of June 2010, at a
median follow-up of 49 months (range, 32-74 months),
50 of 53 patients who had received 90Y-ibritumomab
tiuxetan with stem cell rescue remained alive. The 5-year
overall and event-free survival rates were 94% and 68%,
respectively. Disease status at last follow-up was as follows: Thirty-nine patients (73%) remained alive in complete remission, 8 patients (15%) remained with relapsed
disease, and 3 patients remained alive with sMDS/AML.
To date, 3 patients have died of pulmonary infection,
sMDS/AML, and disease relapse, respectively.
Occurrence and Characterization of
sMDS/AML in HD-RIT-Treated Patients
Although secondary solid tumors were not observed in
study patients, BM cytogenetic abnormalities were
detected in 4 of 53 patients at 6 months, 12 months, 27
months, and 36 months after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan
and at 124 months, 19 months, 176 months, and 48
months after diagnosis, respectively. At the time cytogenetic abnormalities initially were detected, 3 patients had
unilinear cytopenia without morphologic evidence of BM
blasts, whereas 10% BM blasts were detected in 1 patient
(Table 2). According to World Health Organization criteria,36 refractory anemia with excess of blasts 1 (RAEB-1)
was diagnosed in 1 patient (Unique Patient Number
[UPN] 48), whereas refractory cytopenia with unilineage
dysplasia (RCUD) was diagnosed in the other 3 patients,
with acute leukemia transformation observed in 2 patients
(UPN 5 and UPN 34) 12 months and 18 months after the
initial detection of abnormal cytogenetics, respectively. The
median dose of CD34-positive cells (7.4  106 cells; range,
7.2 to 10.0  106 cells) reinfused per kilogram of body
weight in the 4 patients who developed sMDS/AML did not

5078

differ significantly compared with the dose received by the
remaining patients. All patients who developed sMDS/AML
were reinfused with PBSCs that were harvested after HDcytarabine. Three of 4 patients had received alkylating agents
as part of the different chemotherapy regimens administered
before transplantation. In addition, 3 of 4 patients were aged
>65 years, and 2 of 4 patients received 90Y-ibritumomab
tiuxetan treatment several years after their initial diagnosis of
lymphoma. In all instances, cytogenetic abnormalities
involved chromosomes 5 and/or chromosome 7 (Table 2).
BM Hematopoietic Progenitors
Before patients received 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan treatment, blood values and BM morphology were normal,
and no patient had BM fibrosis. Compared with the control group (n ¼ 57), study patients had a statistically significant reduction in the mean number (standard error
of the mean [SEM]) of BM CFU-Mix values (5.4  0.6
vs 1.6  0.3; P  .05) and CFU-GM values (200  11 vs
69  6; P  .05) but not BFU-E values (68  5 vs 59 
7; P > .05) (Fig. 2A,B). Compared with pretransplantation values, an analysis using the mixed-effects models
detected a transient but significant (P ¼ .002) decrease in
CFU-GM growth 6 months after transplantation
followed by a sustained recovery to baseline values at
Month þ12 after transplantation. CFU-mix and BFU-E
measurements did not vary significantly over time
(P ¼ .138 and P ¼ .066, respectively). An analysis of BM
hematopoietic progenitors in the 4 patients with sMDS/
AML demonstrated baseline and post-transplantation
frequencies of CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM similar
to those detected in patients who did not develop sMDS/
AML. As observed in 2 cases (UPN 34 and UPN 50),
expansion of the leukemic clone was associated with a

progressive reduction in committed progenitor cell frequency (Table 3).
BM Mesenchymal Progenitors
Compared with normal individuals from the control
group (n ¼ 41), study patients had a statistically significant reduction in the mean (SEM) CFU-F values (56 
7 vs 14  2; P  .05) (Fig. 2C). Compared with pretransplantation values, an analysis of CFU-F growth at different time points indicated a trend toward reduction that
was more evident 12 months after transplantation but
that in no instance reached the level of statistical significance in the mixed-effects model (P ¼ .211).
TL Analysis
Compared with baseline values, BM TL had a marked
and progressive decrease after transplantation. Telomere
loss was evident at the 12-month assessment; however,
further loss occurred later on, as observed at 18 months
and even at 24 months after transplantation (Fig. 2D).
Although few BM samples were available for 2 patients
(UPN 5 and UPN 48) who developed sMDS/AML, a
marked reduction in TL was detected on a 12-month BM
sample in a third patient (UPN 50), who then developed
sMDS/AML; a fourth patient (UPN 34) had an early
sMDS/AML at 6 months after ASCT, preventing any
possible correlation with postgraft TL reduction.
Comparison of the Cumulative Incidence of
sMDS/AML in Patients who Received HD-RIT
and Historic Controls
The 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML in
patients who received HD-RIT was 8.29%, as indicated
in Figure 3. Fifty-five patients were identified as a control
group (Table 1); at 5 years of follow-up, the cumulative
incidence of sMDS/AML in this control group was
8.05%, and 5 of those 55 patients developed sMDS/AML
(Fig. 3). There was no statistical differences in the cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML between the HD-RIT
patients and the historic control group (P ¼ .655).

DISCUSSION
The use of radiolabeled antibody as part of pretransplantation conditioning is an attractive approach to increase
the feasibility and efficacy of ASCT. However, the theoretical risk of increasing sMDS/AML by myeloablative
radioimmunotherapy remains a matter of concern. To
address this issue, 53 patients with relapsed/refractory or

de novo, high-risk NHL and a median age of 64 years
were evaluated prospectively by clinical and biologic analyses after a treatment program that included myeloablative doses of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and tandem stem
cell support. The main observation was a 8.29% 5-year
cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML, suggesting an
increased risk compared with recently reported series of
younger patients with lymphoma who received HD therapy and autograft.15,19,38,40 However, when the sMDS/
AML incidence was analyzed in a pair-matched group of
NHL patients who received analogous treatment without
HD-RIT, a comparable 8.05% 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML was observed.
Although comparing single-armed study groups
with ‘‘matched’’ historic control groups is associated
with limitations inherent to retrospective comparisons,
our observation strongly suggests that 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan has limited influence on the development of sMDS/AML; whereas other factors, including
advanced age, extensive pretreatment, and type of
PBSCs harvested and reinfused during the autograft
procedure, are likely to be involved in sMDS/AML
development after RIT-based and chemotherapy-based
autograft treatments.
The current prospective study included serial karyotype monitoring. This allowed the early identification of
cytogenetic abnormalities in 4 of 53 HD-RIT-treated
patients. These abnormalities were associated with morphologic signs of unilinear dysplasia in the absence of BM
blasts as well as CFC growth impairment, suggesting that
conventional morphologic and cytogenetic analysis, but
not CFC assays, are critical for identifying patients with
sMDS/AML. It is noteworthy that mild but persistent
neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia were early markers
of sMDS/AML that could be detected at the time of, or
even before, cytogenetic abnormalities. Overall, these
findings suggest that the occurrence of cytopenia in
patients who receive myeloablative doses of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan requires careful examination, including
morphologic and cytogenetic BM analysis.
The most common cytogenetic abnormalities
detected in sMDS/AML involve either loss of a whole
chromosome 5 and/or chromosome 7 or deletion of the
long arm of these chromosomes,15,41 and no clear relation
has been identified between primary treatment modalities, ie, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and distinct chromosomal abnormalities.41 The 4 patients who developed
sMDS/AML in our study had complex chromosomal
abnormalities that usually are associated with exposure to

alkylating agents, including monosomy of chromosome
7, deletion of the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, and
a translocation involving the long arm of chromosome 7.
Our study did not identify any RIT-related cytogenetic
marker, thus failing to identify any distinct contribution
of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan to the development of
sMDS/AML.
Pretransplantation and post-transplantation levels
of multipotent, myeloid, and fibroblast progenitors were
reduced significantly compared with the levels in normal
controls.42 The decreased number of hematopoietic progenitors coexisting with normal blood cell counts indicates that the hematopoietic system is capable of
compensating for the deficiency of early hematopoietic
progenitor cells, as reported previously in patients who
received highly aggressive chemotherapy or received allogeneic BM transplantation.26,43 This suggest that, even after high doses of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, an increased
demand on stem cells for differentiation takes precedence
over the demand for self-renewal, thus compensating and
maintaining the supply of end cells to the peripheral
blood.
Likely because of the direct effect of HD BM radiation, post-transplantation serial analysis of BM CFC
growth revealed a transient and early impairment of all
classes of BM progenitors, and only CFU-GM was
reduced significantly compared with baseline. However,
this early impairment of CFC growth usually recovered to
baseline levels within 1 year after transplantation. This
short-lasting decrease in BM hematopoietic progenitor
cell growth is in striking contrast to data reported in
patients who received chemotherapy-based conditioning,
and, indeed, experienced a marked and long-lasting
decrease in BM progenitors after transplantation.26,32
Taken together, it can be concluded that HD-RIT has
only limited toxicity on BM hematopoietic and stromal
progenitors.28,32
In contrast to the transient damage of CFC growth,
a significant and progressively worsening reduction of
post-transplantation BM TL usually was detected 1 year
after myeloablative doses of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan.
Such a progressive telomere shortening represents an unusual finding that has not been documented equally in
patients who were conditioned with chemotherapy-based
regimens. Indeed, a possible telomere gain within the first
year after ASCT has been reported by Bhatia et al.32 In
patients who received HDS-CT and underwent ASCT,
we previously reported a significant shortening of TL
compared with that in an age-matched normal control.

group. Such a telomere loss appears to be permanent but
remains unaltered for several years after ASCT.28 Conversely, more severe effects of chemotherapy on the replicative capacity of blood cells might be expected in older
patients. In fact, a previous study documented that elderly
patients who received chemotherapy had more pronounced telomere loss during follow-up compared with
younger patients.44 Thus, the progressive telomere loss
detected in the current series appears to be a distinctive
feature, and the advanced age of the treated patients seems
the most reasonable explanation. However the continuous
post-transplantation telomere loss might be ascribed to

other factors, including the use of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan at high doses, or the exposure of reinfused PBSCs to
residual 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan radiation, or the combinations of all these features. Whatever the reason, the
observation of marked and continuous TL shortening
after autograft, along with the increased incidence of
sMDS/AML, are in keeping with previously published
reports describing a correlation between accelerated telomere loss and the development of sMDS/AML.32,45
In addition to biologic insights, the current study
allowed us to prospectively define the real risk of developing sMDS/AML after HD-RIT. The cumulative

incidence indicates an sMDS/AML occurrence of 8.29%
at 5 years, as discussed above, which is definitely higher
compared with the most recently reported surveys on this
severe, late complication. Furthermore, we had the opportunity of comparing the results from HD-RIT-treated
patients with the behavior of patients who received a quite
similar treatment schedule but without HD-RIT. Indeed,
a long-term survey recently was concluded on a large series
of 1347 patients with NHL who received the HDS-CT
schedule without HD-RIT.38 The cumulative incidence
of sMDS/AML in that series was of 3.09%, 4.52%, at
5 years and 10 years, respectively, and, thus, definitely
was lower compared with the incidence observed in the
HD-RIT series. However, our matched-pair analysis
allowed us to identify among the 1347 HDS-CT-treated
patients a group of 55 patients who had the same clinical
features as patients in the HD-RIT-treated series. Surprisingly, the 2 groups of pair-matched patients had a virtually identical risk of developing sMDS/AML, suggesting
that other factors, including advanced age, extensive pretreatment, and type of PBSCs harvested and reinfused
during the autograft procedure, are likely to play a critical
causative role.
