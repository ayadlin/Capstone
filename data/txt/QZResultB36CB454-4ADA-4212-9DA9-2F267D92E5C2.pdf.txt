ABSTRACT
Serous Ovarian Cancers (SOC) are frequently resistant to programmed cell
death. However, here we describe that these programmed death-resistant cells
are nonetheless sensitive to agents that modulate autophagy. Cytotoxicity is not
dependent upon apoptosis, necroptosis, or autophagy resolution. A screen of NCBI
yielded more than one dozen FDA-approved agents displaying perturbed autophagy in
ovarian cancer. The effects were maximized via combinatorial use of the agents that
impinged upon distinct points of autophagy regulation. Autophagosome formation
correlated with efficacy in vitro and the most cytotoxic two agents gave similar effects
to a pentadrug combination that impinged upon five distinct modulators of autophagy.
However, in a complex in vivo SOC system, the pentadrug combination outperformed
the best two, leaving trace or no disease and with no evidence of systemic toxicity.
Targeting the autophagy pathway in a multi-modal fashion might therefore offer a
clinical option for treating recalcitrant SOC.

benefit, though if drugs which target a single node are too
similar in mechanism or chemical structure, resistance to
one agent can confer resistance to others [8, 9]. Multinodal
targeting may circumvent resistance, although side effects
from such therapy are less predictable. However, the
risk of not finding efficacious regimens to treat cancer
is similarly high; every day this year, an average of 38
women will die of ovarian cancer from failed therapy,
since there are no good options to treat the recalcitrant
disease (American Cancer Society 2015 estimates).
SOC is among the most heterogeneous cancers [10],
which may explain its abysmal five year survival rate of
17–39% (stage III/IV) (SEER 2004–2010 data). Early
stage tumors are very hard to detect with high specificity
[11], and SOC typically presents as disseminated disease.
Standard of care chemotherapy consists of a platinumtaxane two drug regimen and results in an initial 2-year
remission rate of 75% [12]. About half of these patients
will recur. Novel agents targeting SOC rarely have
sufficient impact to advance to Phase III trials.
Autophagy has been implicated as a mechanism
in which dormant or otherwise chemotherapy resistant
cells survive the initial platinum-taxane regimen [13–15].

INTRODUCTION
Targeted drugs with better safety profiles than
traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics are increasingly
available in the oncologist’s armament. While use of
single agent targeted therapies has shown only limited
success [1–3], the lower toxicity of the drugs provides
significant hope that logical combinations of these drugs
may offer improved options relative to single drugs alone.
Since each tumor might bear a fraction of cells resistant to
any single therapy [4, 5], the use of monotherapies leaves
resistant cells to initiate recurrent disease. Yet, problems of
drug resistance in non-oncologic fields, including bacterial
infection [6] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
[7], have been successfully approached with the use of
multiple agents. Highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) was similarly developed to combat the high
mutation rates present in HIV, and represents a remarkable
success using three drug combinations.
In oncology, where the existing standards of care
are highly toxic, there is little room for the addition of
even those agents with modest toxicity. Targeting a single
node on a signaling pathway with multiple drugs can be of

However, autophagy agents have also been shown
to induce death in SOC cell lines [16, 17]. Here, we
examined both mode of death and cooperativity of
the autophagy-modulating agents. While we noted an
excellent cytotoxic effect of single agents that altered
autophagy in vitro, the combinatorial use of relatively low
toxicity agents revealed dramatic increases in cytotoxic
efficacy in mouse tumor models. Based on these results,
we suggest that it may be possible to create a combination
that is able to treat the inherent heterogeneity of the tumor
while harboring a favorable safety profile.

autophagy. In many cases, the autophagic response is
elicited to try to correct the stress inducing programmed
cell death. One indicator of cellular stress is sequestosome,
or p62, an adaptor that targets ubiquinated proteins to
autophagosomes, though it may also recruit caspase-8 [23]
or RIPK1 [24] as part of apoptotic or necroptotic pathways
respectively (Figure 1).
To evaluate cell death in the context of autophagy
inducing drugs, we drugged OVCAR3 cells within the
range found in monotherapy treated patients’ blood
(Table 2). Although many ovarian cancer cell lines are not
genetically representative of SOC [25], the OVCAR3 line
closely aligns with TCGA-documented SOC, has a deep
accompanying dataset (>1000 publications), and behavior
similar to cisplatin resistant cells derived from recurrent
patients [26]. In agreement with prior literature, we noted
an induction of autophagosomes upon drug addition.
This was indicated by an increase in steady state LC3-II
compared to β-actin, not the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio, which
may have confounding signals from protein turnover
during autophagy as well as LC3-I induction independent
of autophagic flux [27]. Interestingly, a correlation of
LC3-II/β-actin with cell loss (p < 0.006, Figure 2A) was
observed among four of the five drugs, while metformin
was observed to be relatively ineffective (<5% cell loss)
in OVCAR3 cells.
Strikingly, none of the drugs induced PARP cleavage
(as observed in apoptosis, and sometimes in necroptosis)
or phosphorylation of MLKL (a marker of necroptosis)
(Figure 2B–2E). The results suggested that cell loss was
not associated with apoptotic or necroptotic cell death.
To investigate this further, we employed pharmacologic
agents to directly modulate the apoptotic and necroptotic
pathways. The inhibitor z-VADfmk blocks cysteine protease
activity, compromising caspase activation and attenuating
apoptosis, and can potentiate necroptosis. Necrostatin is
an inhibitor of RIPK1 activity and blocks many forms of
necroptosis. Necrostatin and z-VADfmk both proved able
to modulate death induced by a small molecule antagonist
of the IAPs (Figure 2F). In this case, z-VADfmk potentiated
necroptotic death, while necrostatin rescued cell survival
[26]. However, neither necrostatin nor z-VADfmk showed
more than 10% rescue in cell loss induced by nelfinavir,
chloroquine, dasatinib, or rapamycin (Figure 2G–2J).
In summary, all agents which created autophagic stress,
as represented by dasatinib, rapamycin, and nelfinavir,
promoted cell death. However, inhibition of autophagy
by chloroquine also promoted death. Thus, death did not
appear to occur as a result of autophagy per se, although
LC3-II expression increased along with cytotoxicity.

RESULTS
Identification of drugs that modulate autophagy
Targeting autophagy has been described as a
method to enhance killing of subpopulations of SOC cells
resistant to chemotherapy [13]. Since “autophagic death”
can occur in parallel to classical forms of programmed
cell death [20], such as apoptosis and/or necroptosis, and
apoptotic and necroptotic initiation proteins are frequently
inactive in SOC [18], we sought to investigate the mode
of cell killing by agents which impact autophagy, with the
hope of possible rapid translation to logical combination
therapies within a clinical milieu.
In a filtered search using the terms “autophagy”
and “ovarian cancer” in PubMed and Google Scholar, 26
agents were found to impact autophagy in ovarian cancer
(Table 1). Among these, 13 are FDA-approved and with
a modest adverse event profile in patients (Figure 1).
Surprisingly, however, these agents influence a repertoire
of cellular processes including cellular metabolism,
protein phosphorylation, proteotoxic stress, and lysosome
acidification. This variation in target pathways suggests
a broad interaction between SOC biological processes
and autophagy. Within each molecular process, we then
selected the drug with the lowest overall adverse events
for further study. One was the DNA-targeted drug
doxorubicin, which indirectly activates autophagy in
response to genotoxic stress. The other five drugs were the
ER stressor nelfinavir, the lysosomal acidification inhibitor
chloroquine, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, the antidiabetic metformin, and the Src family kinase inhibitor
dasatinib (Figure 1).

Autophagy-modulating agents do not induce
classical cell death pathways
“Autophagic death” occurs via several mechanisms,
yet it has been suggested to be a misnomer, since
autophagy often accompanies other forms of cell death
[21]. It therefore becomes important to distinguish
between causation, such as when autophagosomes act
as an intracellular scaffold for caspase-8 activation [22],
vs. simple co-occurrence of programmed cell death and

observed. Interestingly, the addition of rapamycin to
other autophagy-initiating agents produced significantly
additive effect on cell death (Figure 3A, 3B). Similar
results were obtained when chloroquine was combined
with these agents (Figure 3C, 3D), raising the notion that
autophagy occurred in response to an autophagic stress
on the cells.
Higher order combinations of the five drugs
produced, in general, increasing efficacy (Figure 3E).
However, the combination of chloroquine and nelfinavir
(CN) was also among the most potent at inducing cell
death, and the only two-drug combination found to do
so in a 48 hour time-frame. Nonetheless, immunoblot
analysis of LC3-II levels at 24 hours proved a reasonable
surrogate of cell death at 48 hours (Figure 3F); peaking in
those combinations that had maximal cytotoxic activity.
Similar efficacy was found in other SOC models ID8ip,
OVCAR8, and PS#3971, and did not depend on cisplatin
sensitivity (Supplementary Figure S1).

autophagy system [29]. Nelfinavir or chloroquine
treatment elevated punctate p62, while rapamycin and
dasatinib had a more modest effect, and metformin
slightly reduced p62 but did not alter punctate LC3
compared to controls. However, when drugs were used
together, p62 accumulated, suggesting the presence of
an ongoing, unrelieved proteotoxic stress despite the
overt induction of autophagy. The p62 and LC3 punctae
reached a maximum signal upon treatment with all five
autophagy drugs, which we term for simplicity Necramed
(Nelfinavir, chloroquine, rapamycin, metformin, and
dasatinib).
To further test the quality of autophagy, we used
a dual labeled mCherry-GFP-LC3 reporter system
[30]. Autophagolysosome formation quenches the GFP
signal due to acidification, which mCherry is resistant
to and remains fluorescing red. Yellow punctae thus
primarily represent autophagosome structures which
have not successfully fused with functional lysosomes
and therefore have not cleared enclosed damaged
organelles and proteins. As expected with a drug
combination containing chloroquine, LC3 punctae
using this reporter were primarily yellow, stalled
autophagosomes, which accumulated during Necramed
treatment (Figure 4C).

Combinatorial autophagic stresses enhance
LC3 and p62 punctae
To evaluate whether LC3-II accumulation
corresponded to the presence of autophagosomes, we next
stained cells to evaluate the relocalization of LC3 from
diffuse cytosolic distribution to punctae indicative of
autophagic vesicles. Following treatment with the panel of
agents, alone (Figure 4A) or in combination (Figure 4B),
we found that the relative measure of LC3 positive punctae
was in agreement with the immunoblot data.
In parallel, we evaluated the presence of p62/
sequestosome as a reporter of the cell’s sensation of
proteotoxic stress. Autophagy normally clears p62
when functioning properly, however stress that induces
autophagy also induces p62 expression [14, 28].
Punctate p62 can therefore indicate an over-stressed

Evaluation of combinations of cell stressors
in vivo
Given that the cytotoxicity in vitro was similar
between all five autophagy drugs and the simple
combination of chloroquine and nelfinavir (Figure 3E),
despite apparent differences in proteotoxic stress induced
in the cells, we wondered whether these two approaches
might act similarly in vivo. To test this, the syngeneic,
ID8ip-mCherry [19] cell model was used. The literature on
the doses of these autophagic drugs to use in vivo varies,

indications of toxicity either by gross visual examination
or by weight loss in either the CN or Necramed groups

to select drugs with minimal adverse effects (Figure 1)
there were no gross histological changes in Necramedtreated mice (Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, no signs
of toxicity in blood panels were observed in Necramedtreated mice relative to untreated mice (Supplementary

affecting a defined pathway in ovarian cancer permits
one to derive a safe and efficacious combination. Here,
agents were not selected based on a history of oncologic
use, but rather on reported alteration of autophagy. Our
data supports a limited impact of single agents, since even
the best two agents combined lacked significant effect in
our aggressive mouse model. In contrast, reducing one
effective component from 250 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg retained
significant activity when used as part of the five drug
combination therapy.
The agents that came through the screen are varied
in targets and function. Dasatinib, originally designed
as an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, also targets tyrosine kinases
such as Src which act upstream of Akt and mTOR [16]
(Supplementary Figure S3). Rapamycin, which failed
as a cancer monotherapy, acts proximal to the Becn1/
Ulk1/Vps34 autophagy initiation complex by inhibiting
mTORC1 [32]. The other agents are rarely or never
indicated for cancer therapy. Nelfinavir is an inhibitor
of HIV-1 protease [33], but induces ER stress [34, 35],
reduces proteasome function [36], and may weakly inhibit
an array of kinases including Akt [37]. Metformin is
used in diabetes mellitus; it is thought to trigger AMPK
upstream of the Becn1/Ulk1/Vps34 complex [38], though
it has additional metabolic effects [39] that may impact
stem cells [40] and contribute to its documented capacity
to improve survival of ovarian cancer patients [41].
Chloroquine is unique in its capacity to block autophagy.
More specifically, it blocks late events, preventing fusion
of autophagosomes with lysosomes and autophagic
‘flux’ [42, 43]. Developed as an antimalarial, it has been
used in a small number of cancer clinical trials [44], and
derivatives of chloroquine are currently of interest in a
number of cancers.
Although drug combinations are routinely
prescribed in antimicrobial applications, oncologists

LC3-II is detected in tumors treated with the
necramed combination
A problem with the observed efficacy was that
it did not permit the evaluation of LC3-II increases
with treatment, as there were no substantial tumors left
amenable to immunoblot analysis. To remedy this and test
another tumor model, we next treated mice with Necramed
in which we titrated nelfinavir to 5% (25 mg/kg, 1/10th
the ID8ip model dose) of a dose converted from human
use into a mouse dose [31], following seeding with the
human PS#3971 tumor model. The reduced-nelfinavir
combination impacted the distribution of tumors in vivo
(Figure 5C) but enough tumor remained to allow for
detection of increased LC3-II/β-actin in treated mice
(Figure 5D). Altogether, the results supported the notion
that LC3-II acted as a reporter for Necramed activity.

avoid combinations in cancer chemotherapy, since they
frequently involve pushing the limits of toxicity in the
attempt to eradicate cancer and may not offer further
benefit [45] if their mechanism of action is similar.
Therefore, to best allow for combining these agents with
minimal chance of detrimental side effects, we focused
this screen on those drugs with the lowest number and
severity of adverse event reports. Consistent with this,
we did not observe systemic toxicity, even in mice treated
with all five agents. In retrospect, this is perhaps not
surprising; a ‘typical’ cancer patient is associated with an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

aging demographic that frequently takes medications for
one, or many, unrelated non-oncologic indications.
This screen targeted drugs that modulate autophagy,
which is considered both a cancer cell survival factor
[46, 47] and drug resistance [15] factor in ovarian cancer.
Although we induce autophagosome formation, it does not
appear to be the instrument of cell death. In fact, we make
the distinction that arresting autophagy did not ameliorate
death, but rather enhanced it (Figure 3). Together with prior
data, this supports the concept that autophagy may represent
a mechanism by which tumor cells resolve inherent or

induced stresses [48, 49]. Thus, combining agents which
initiated cell stresses that activate autophagy with one that
blocked resolution of autophagy acted cooperatively to
kill cells (Figure 6). In our study, we found no evidence
of apoptosis or necroptosis. Considering that resistance
to apoptosis is a common hallmark of cancer [50] it may
be that alternative mechanisms of cytotoxicity, such as
proteotoxicity, are worth considering in a therapeutic
context.
Can these results translate into the clinic? The focus
on limited adverse events based on existing patient data,
some from very large cohorts [51], appears promising for
the perspective of a Phase I trial. Hesitation to use drug
combinations is waning. Doxorubicin is a standard second/
third line treatment for SOC, usually given in a less toxic
pegylated liposomal form as Doxil®, and has been used in
combination with anti-HIV HAART therapy for Kaposi’s
sarcoma. HAART typically consists of a minimum of a
three drug combination and has included Nelfinavir. Doxil®,
with its standard use and relatively favorable side effect
profile, may be an ideal candidate for the chemotherapy
which uses Necramed in an adjuvant setting.
How might Necramed itself be administered? We
delivered all drugs by gavage, since in human patients

all drugs are delivered orally. Theoretically, a slight delay
in the administration of chloroquine might optimize
the effects of the other collaborative, stress-inducing
agents. However, we co-administered all drugs, at least
initially, to simplify patient compliance and adherence.
Since concomitant dosing of all drugs was successful and
tolerable in our mouse models, simultaneous dosing is a
viable clinical option. Drug dosage can be immediately
reduced within individual patients if side effects are
limiting, as may be determined in a Phase I clinical trial.
Given the daily loss of more than three dozen women in
the US to ovarian cancer, the risk of avoiding efficacious
combination therapies is very high, and can outweigh the
potential risks of combinatorial side effects.

Biologicals #NB100-2220), PARP (BD Biosciences
#51-6639GR), pS358-MLKL (abcam #ab187091) were
used. Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were antirabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch #211-032-171) anti-rat
(Life Technologies #619520), or anti-mouse (Jackson
ImmunoResearch #115-035-003). Drugs. Cisplatin (Teva
Pharmaceuticals, US, 1 mg/ml injectable) was obtained by
the Moores Cancer Center pharmacy. Metformin (VWR,
cat# 89147-892), chloroquine phosphate (Fisher Scientific,
ICN19391910), rapamycin (LC Labs, cat# R-5000),
dasatinib (LC Labs, cat# D-3307), and nelfinavir mesylate
(Creative Dynamics Inc, special order except in syngeneic
mouse model, which used pulverized Viracept tablets
obtained from the Moores Cancer Center pharmacy) were
purchased in powdered form. PEG400 for in vivo drug
vehicle was from Spectrum Laboratory Products (#TCIN0443-500G) and mixed with sterile saline (Teknova,
#S5812). Patient consent was obtained for scientific use
and publication of the OV#3971 patient derived ovarian
cancer [18].

Membrane was blocked in 5% dry milk (Genesee Scientific,
#20-241). Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution,
and secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were used at
1:5,000 dilution. HRP substrate and enhancer was used at
600 μL per membrane (Super Signal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate, Pierce # 34075).

Immunofluorescence
Coverslips coated with 2 μg/ml fibronectin were
placed into non-TC treated 6 well plates. Excess fibronectin
was removed with PBS washes. 10,000 cells were seeded
directly onto the coverslip and allowed to adhere for
30 minutes at 37°C. Media with drugs or vehicle was then
added to a total volume of 3 ml. Cells were incubated
at 37°C for 24 hours. Media was removed and 1 ml 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS was added for 15 minutes at
room temperature. Supernatant was aspirated and cells were
washed once with PBS. PBS was aspirated and 2 ml 0.1%
Triton in PBS was added for intracellular permeabilization.
After 2 minutes, supernatant was aspirated and PBS
wash performed. Cells were then blocked in 2% BSA for
30 minutes at room temperature and then a PBS wash
performed. Primary antibodies were then added in 2%
BSA (1:1000 dilution for LC3, 1:500 dilution for p62) and
incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. After three
PBS washes, secondary antibodies were added in 2% BSA
with DAPI (1.5 μg/ml) at a 1:1000 dilution for 90 minutes.
Three more PBS washes were performed, and then one
final ten minute PBS wash performed. PBS was aspirated
and coverslips were mounted on glass slides using 30 μl
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories #H-1400). Cells were
imaged on a Nikon confocal microscope, creating z-stacks
to permit punctae quantitation. Flattened z-stacks were used
to quantify punctae in ImageJ by MaxEntropy thresholding.

Crystal violet proliferation assays
Cells (2,500–5,000/well) were seeded onto 96 well
TC treated plates, allowed to attach, and then treated
with drugs or control vehicle in a total volume of 100 μl.
Plates were placed at 37°C for 48 hours (unless otherwise
indicated). Media was removed and cells were washed
once with 125 μl PBS. PBS was then removed and 50 μl
crystal violet stain (0.11% crystal violet, 0.17M NaCl,
22% MeOH, in water) was added. After 30 minutes
room temperature staining, stain was removed and
125 μl PBS was added as a wash. Supernatant was
carefully removed to minimize cell disturbance but
maximize removal of unbound crystal violet. Plates
were then dried at 37°C for one hour without lid and
85 μl MeOH was added to solubilize the crystal violet.
Absorbance was read at 600 nm to determine cell density.
Percent growth inhibition (%Cell Loss) was calculated
using the formula: 100-(100*AbsDrug/AbsControl). This
reflects loss from either death or impaired proliferation.

Autophagic flux microscopy
OVCAR3 cells with mCherry-GFP-LC3B
(Addgene, plasmid # 22418) retroviral integrants were
seeded (100 k cells) on a 12 well fibronectin treated (2 μg/
ml) glass bottom plate and allowed to adhere overnight.
Fields of view were set on an Olympus IX51 microscope
outfitted with an environmental apparatus allowing for
tissue culture (37°C and 5% CO2) conditions. Drugs
were added and then cells imaged for mCherry and GFP
fluorescence every 4 hours.

Western immunoblotting
Cells (3 × 106) were seeded on 10 cm plates, allowed
to adhere for 16–24 hours, and treated with drugs or
control for 24 hours at 37°C. 300–400 μl iced RIPA buffer
(supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (SigmaAldrich), 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mM NaF)
was added to lyse the cells (15 minutes, room temperature)
at which point cells were collected using a cell lifter (Fisher
Scientific). Lysates were spun at 10,000 g for 10 minutes
at 4°C and supernatant saved and quantified by BCA assay
(Pierce #23235). 30 μg protein was loaded per well of a 15%
SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.

Mouse cancer models
All animal protocols were approved by the UCSD
IACUC; appropriate regulations were followed during
experimentation on animals. Syngeneic model: 3 × 106
mCherry labeled ID8ip cells [19], which have been
passaged in the peritoneal cavity, were injected into
syngeneic female C5BL/6 mice at 10 weeks of age. Eight
mice of equal mean weights were used in each group.

14 days after injection, the control group received daily
(7x/week) vehicle gavage injections (50% PEG400),
the CN group received daily gavages of chloroquine
(30 mg/kg) and nelfinavir (250 mg/kg, from pulverized
Viracept tablets) in 50% PEG400, and the Necramed
group received daily gavages of chloroquine (30 mg/
kg), nelfinavir (250 mg/kg), rapamycin (2.24 mg/kg),
metformin (150 mg/kg), and dasatinib (4 mg/kg) in
50% PEG400. Mice were monitored daily for distended
abdomens following the first treatment injections. All
mice were euthanized when ascites formation produced
visible discomfort to control animals, which occurred
after 14 days of treatment (28 days since cell injection).
The peritoneum of the mice was exposed and any visible
nodules on the peritoneum wall were surgically dissected
along with the liver and ovaries. These tissues were then
imaged with the OV100 Small Animal Imaging System
(Olympus). Brightfield, GFP, and mCherry channel
information were collected and only red fluorescent (but
not green autofluorescent) punctae area was quantified in
ImageJ. Fluorescent area was mathematically converted
into tumor volume assuming spherical shape of the
tumor and circular shape of the fluorescent area with
the equations: area = πr2 and volume = 4π/3r3. Recurrent
platinum resistant intraperitoneal low passage patient
derived model: PS#3971 cells were isolated from a
patient’s ascites with recurrent SOC. The patient failed
the next round of platinum therapy, and her cells were
verified to be platinum resistant (Supplementary Figure S1).
Cells were grown in standard adherent tissue culture
conditions until a sufficient number of cells was obtained
(<5 passages). Mice were randomized into equal weight
groups. Three million PS#3971 cells were injected IP into
nude mice, allowed to disseminate and grow for 7 days,
and then daily gavaging and weighing began. Necramed
(150mg/kg metformin, 50 mg/kg chloroquine, 25 mg/kg
[5% human-mouse converted dose equivalent] nelfinavir,
2.25 mg/kg rapamycin, and 10 mg/kg dasatinib, in
50% PEG400/saline) or control (50% PEG400, 50%
saline) gavaging was performed for 32 days. Mice
were euthanized and visible tumors were harvested,
photographed, weighed, and lysed for immunoblotting.

a Nikon Eclipse TE2000E inverted microscope. An
additional 3 pairs of C57BL/6 mice were treated with
control or Necramed for 21 days, sacrificed, and blood
collected immediately by cardiac extraction. Blood was
centrifuged in a Micro Serum Separator (Professional
Hospital Supply) and plasma saved in a microcentrifuge
tube at –20°C until analysis by a VetScan instrument
using a VS Complete Diagnostic Profile.
