ABSTRACT
ATP-dependent Lon protease within mitochondrial matrix contributes to the
degradation of abnormal proteins. The oxidative or hypoxic stress which represents
the stress phenotype of cancer leads to up-regulation of Lon. However, the role of Lon
in bladder cancer remains undefined. Here, we found that Lon expression in bladder
cancer tissues was significantly higher than those in noncancerous tissues; downregulation of Lon in bladder cancer cells significantly blocked cancer cell proliferation
via suppression c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation due to decreased
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced the sensitivity of bladder
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents by promoting apoptosis. We further found
that Lon down-regulation in bladder cancer cells decreased cellular bioenergetics as
determined by measuring aerobic respiration and glycolysis using extracellular flux
analyzer. The tissue microarray (TMA) results showed that high expression of Lon
was related to the T and TNM stage, as well as histological grade of bladder cancer
patients. We also demonstrated that Lon was an independent prognostic factor for
overall survival of bladder cancer patients. Taken together, our data suggest that Lon
could serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for treatment
of bladder cancer, as well as for prediction of the effectiveness of chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

evolutionarily conserved ATP-dependent proteases.
As one of the three ATP-dependent serine protease
located in mitochondrial matrix, Lon contributes to the
degradation of abnormal proteins including misfolded,
misassembled, aggregated or damaged proteins, as well
as the maintenance of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA)
[1, 2]. Bladder cancer is the most common urinary
system malignancy, and considered as the fifth most
popular neoplasm in industrialized countries [3]. Direct

Mitochondria play a primary role in cellular
bioenergetics in most eukaryotic cells, which are
responsible for producing nearly 95% of cellular ATP
through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as
well as the control of cell death or survival. Protein

the tumor viability, which is controlled precisely by the

standard for patients with microscopic or gross hematuria
[4]. A high recurrence rate and the risk of progression of
bladder cancer leads to the need for a frequent and long
time surveillance, causing bladder cancer being the most
expensive cancer to treat [5, 6]. Multiple genetic and
epigenetic factors are believed to contribute to the risk of
developing bladder cancer. Cumulative increase in these
genetic defects also provides prognostic assessment for
disease outcome. However, it is necessary to understand
the molecular mechanism of bladder carcinogenesis for the
development and implementation of urinary biomarkers
for both diagnosis and surveillance, which will finally
reduce the need for frequent cytoscopies and the cost for
the treatment [7]. Moreover, the proteins found correlated
with the tumor progression will also be potential targets
for therapy of bladder cancer and improve the prognosis.
The involvement of mitochondria in cell death
implies its critical role in probing the cellular sensitivity to
anticancer drugs. Lon is an ATP-dependent serine protease
with multi-functional enzyme and highly conserved from
bacteria to mammalian mitochondria and peroxisomes
[8, 9]. Although the majority of Lon is soluble within the
mitochondrial matrix, it is also found in mitochondrial
nucleoids with the roles in mtDNA maintenance [10, 11].
Lon is a nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial protein
which exerts multiple functions in the organelle [12]. Lon
can regulate the replication of mtDNA, due to its ability to
bind DNA. Mammalian Lon protease binds single stranded
DNA (ssDNA) with specificity for a G-rich consensus
sequence either in vitro or in vivo [11, 12, 13]. In humans,
Lon protease plays a crucial role in the quality control
of mitochondrial proteins in the matrix by selectively
degrading misfolded, unassembled or oxidatively
damaged proteins and certain short-lived regulatory
proteins [14, 15, 16]. Lon is a stress protein and can be
induced by a number of stresses such as accumulation of
unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), hypoxia
and other stress conditions [17, 18, 19, 20]. The Lon upregulation may be critical for cancer cell survival by
preventing abnormal mitochondrial proteins accumulation
and aggregation in response to oxidative, hypoxic, and ER
stress.
The maintenance of Lon homeostasis is important to
cell fate, since its down-regulation leads to decreased cell
proliferation and apoptosis [21, 22, 23, 24]. Mitochondria
are contributed to major reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation resulted from the “electron leak” form electron
transport chain (ETC) [25]. Although physiological levels
of ROS play an important role in normal cell proliferation
and regulating the cellular signaling, while the excessive
amount of ROS production released from mitochondria
leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) cascade including the phosphorylation of JNK,
p38 and ERK [26]. Thus, ROS are involved in tumor
initiation, progression, as well as maintenance.
It has been reported that over-expression and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increased of proteolytic activity of Lon protease result
in the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and
cell tumorigenesis [27, 28]. However, no report has
been described how up-regulated Lon promotes bladder
cancer cell survival and tumorigenesis. Therefore, a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
the relationship between tumor cells of bladder and Lon
will facilitate the approaches in cancer treatment.
In this study, we analyzed the mRNA and protein
expression level of Lon in paired human bladder cancer
tissues and adjacent normal bladder tissues by quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, and found
that both Lon mRNA and protein expression levels in
bladder cancer tissues are dramatically increased. To
investigate the mechanism and biological functions of Lon
involved in bladder tumorigenesis, we down-regulated
Lon protein levels by using a small interfering RNA
(siRNA) transfected in human bladder cancer ScaBER and
UM-UC-3 cells. Our results showed that depletion of Lon
in ScaBER and UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells reduced
cell proliferation and cellular bioenergetics. Moreover,
we found that inhibition of Lon decreases efficacy of
chemotherapeutic reagents and reduces ROS production,
which activates MAPK pathway to promote tumor
progression. To further understand the clinical significance
of Lon protein expression in bladder cancer progression,
we employed tissue microarray (TMA) to examine the
expression patterns of Lon in a large cohort of bladder
cancer patients’ specimen and analyzed the relationship
between Lon expression and clinicopathological features
of bladder cancer. We found that Lon expression
positively correlates to tumor grade, T stage and TNM
stage. Furthermore, multivariate survival analysis result
indicated that Lon protein expression is an independent
prognostic factor for predicting the outcome of bladder
cancer patients. These findings suggested that Lon could
be used as potential clinical diagnostic and/or prognostic
marker, as well as a novel target for therapy of bladder
cancer patients and in predicting the effectiveness of
chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Expression of Lon in human bladder cancer cell
lines and tumor tissues
To understand the expression profile of Lon in
human bladder cancer cell lines, we determined both the
mRNA and protein expression levels of Lon in five human
bladder cancer cell lines ScaBER, UM-UC-3, SW780, J82
and T24 (Figure 1A and 1B). To further validate whether
Lon expression is associated with tumor progression in
bladder cancer, western blot analysis was performed for
45 patients (including 45 tumor tissue and 45 matched

adjacent normal tissues) diagnosed with bladder cancer.
As shown in Figure 1C and Figure 1D (n=45, p<0.001),
the Lon protein expression was very low but detectable
in most normal bladder tissues. By contrast, Lon protein
expression was markedly increased in tumor tissues
(Figure 1C and 1D). In addition, the mRNA level of Lon
was also significantly increased in bladder cancer tissues
compared with matched normal tissues (Figure 1E, n=22,
p=0.007).

depleted ScaBER and UM-UC-3 cells. Lon knockdown
significantly decreased the proliferation of human bladder
cancer cell line ScaBER (p< 0.05; Figure 2C) and UMUC-3 (p< 0.05; Figure 2D). These data indicate that downregulation Lon protease expression inhibits bladder cancer
cell proliferation.

Previous reports have shown that up-regulation of
Lon protease in oral squamous cell carcinoma, non-small
cell lung carcinoma cell line as well as 293 cells leads to
mitochondrial complex I mediated ROS generation, which
plays critical roles in tumorigenesis [24]. Transiently
knockdown Lon in the WI-38 VA-13 human lung
fibroblasts results in caspase 3 activation and promoting
cell death [19]. Our previous work demonstrated that

Uncontrolled cell proliferation is one of the most
important characteristics of tumor development. To
further investigate the role of Lon in bladder cancer cell
proliferation, we depleted Lon with siRNA specifically
targeting Lon in ScaBER and UM-UC-3 cells (Figure
2A and 2B), then assessed cellular proliferation of Lon

Lon knockdown leads to lymphoma cell death and
Lon inhibition plays an important role in 2-cyano-3,
12-dioxooleana-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)-induced
lymphoma cell death [22]. Based on these findings and
taking into account the role of Lon in mitochondrial
proteins homeostasis, we asked whether Lon overexpression in human bladder cancer cells participates
in chemotherapeutic drug resistance by decreasing
efficacy of cytotoxic regents to promote bladder cancer
progression. To validate this hypothesis, we examined
the effect of a concentration gradient of doxorubicin to
control and Lon knockdown UM-UC-3 cells for 12 h,
and we found a significant dose-dependent increase in
apoptosis compared with negative control cells (Figure
3A). Lon down-regulated UM-UC-3 cells exhibited more
cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 compared with that in
negative control cells. In addition, we performed MTT
assay to further investigate the Lon knockdown UM-UC-3
cell viability after doxorubicin treatment, and we found
that the relative cell number was dramatically decreased
in Lon down-regulated UM-UC-3 cells (Figure 3B).
Moreover, we analyzed the cell survival rate difference
after doxorubicin treatment between negative control cells
and Lon knockdown cells, and our data showed that there
is a significant increase of mortality rate in Lon downregulated cells (Figure 3C and 3D). Taken together, these
data indicate that Lon may play a critical role in anticancer

drug resistance and provide a novel target for bladder
cancer therapy.

Down-regulation of Lon decreased mitochondrial
ROS production as well as c-Jun N-terminal
kinases (JNK) activation
Increased ROS can stimulate Ras activity and
phosphorylate MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which are ROS
level dependent tumor-associated pathways. To investigate
the association of Lon expression and ROS production,
DCFH-DA was used to determine the intracellular ROS
production, and we found that ROS are dramatically
decreased in Lon knockdown bladder cancer cells UMUC-3 and ScaBER compared with that in control cells
with regular Lon protein level (Figure 4A and 4B).
Mitochondria are the major sources of ROS; we stained
Lon knockdown and control cells with a mitochondrial
superoxide indicator MitoSox to further confirm the
alteration of mitochondrial ROS levels. We found that
down-regulation of Lon significantly inhibits ROS
generation in the mitochondria of human bladder cancer
cells UM-UC-3 and ScaBER (Figure 4C and 4D). Thus, we
examined the phosphorylation of JNK and AKT to confirm
whether the downstream kinases of MAPK signaling
pathway was inhibited in Lon knockdown bladder

cancer cells due to suppression of ROS production . Our
data showed that p-JNK was down-regulated in bladder
cancer cells depleted Lon protease, while p-AKT remains
unchanged (Figure 4E). Moreover, p53 was also upregulated in response to Lon depletion in bladder cancer
cells (Figure 4E), which further support our results that
Lon knockdown enhances doxorubicin induced apoptosis
(Figure 3A). Finally, we did not find any difference in
mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) level in Lon
knockdown and control bladder cancer cells and which is
in agreement with our previous results [29]. Collectively,
our findings suggest that inhibition of Lon reduces the
generation of ROS in bladder cancer cells, and may cause
the inhibition of bladder cancer cell proliferation through
down-regulation of JNK phosphorylation in ROS-induced
MAPK pathway.

hypoxic environment. Recent studies have demonstrated
that up-regulation of Lon expression may be critical
for cancer cell survival by regulating stress responses
induced by oxidative and hypoxic condition [28], which
are common tumor-microenvironment characters of cancer
cells. In addition, in view of its chaperone properties and
the roles in mtDNA maintenance [29], Lon enables the
mitochondria to function more efficiently in oxidative
phosphorylation in response to the limited oxygen. So we
speculated that Lon knockdown will inhibit cancer cell
survival via reducing cellular bioenergetics of bladder
cancer cells.
To investigate the effect of Lon knockdown
on cellular bioenergetics of bladder cancer cells, we
first assessed the real-time oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) by measuring the cellular oxygen consumption
rates (OCR) and glycolysis by assaying the extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) in UM-UC-3 and ScaBER
cells with extracellular flux analyzer. OCR and ECAR
are indicators of mitochondrial respiration and lactic acid
production via aerobic glycolysis in cells, respectively.
OCR for control and Lon down-regulated UM-UC-3 cells
throughout bioenergetics analysis are shown in Figure
5A. Overall, Lon depletion using siRNA resulted in a
marked reduction of the total mitochondrial respiratory
capacity compared to the control cells as assessed by AUC

Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in Lon

Lon, as one of the mitochondrial matrix proteases,
plays a critical role in protein quality control and
appears to regulate aerobic respiratory function by its
multiple functions. Under hypoxic conditions, Lon is
up-regulated by the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) to maintain mitochondrial protein homeostasis in a

UM-UC-3 cells were transfected with control (NC) and Lon siRNA; 48 h post transfection, cells were seeded into six-well plate followed

and methods. (C&D) Based on the MTT assay results, relative cell numbers after doxorubicin (0, 1, and 2 μg/μL) treatment were showed

(Figure 5B). Reduced basal OCR and ECAR in Lon downregulated cells are showed in Figure 5C. Down-regulation
of Lon significantly reduced basal OCR compared to
that in control cells (Figure 5D), which was blocked by
the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, suggesting that
Lon knockdown leads to lower energy production from
OXPHOS of bladder cancer cells (Figure 5A), indicating
the additional ATP requirement must be applied from
glycolysis via increasing its activity. In addition, injecting
the uncoupler FCCP increased OCR both in Lon siRNA
cells and control cells, but Lon siRNA cells showed less
OCR increase (Figure 5A). Finally, addition of ETC
inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A blocked all electron
transfer through complex I and complex III, led to a
dramatically decrease in OCR in both control and Lon
siRNA cells, and the OCR under the line of rotenone/
antimycin A-treated was contributed to capacity for
ROS production and non-mitochondrial O2 consumption

(Figure 5A). To further evaluate the difference of OCR
variation between Lon siRNA and control cells, we
assessed the mitochondrial function parameters by
analyzing the OCR data at time point1-12, and we found
markedly decrease of basal respiratory as well as ECAR at
basal condition in Lon knockdown cells (p=0.002, Figure
5D), which indicated that Lon may play a crucial role in
regulating cellular energy metabolism. Moreover, maximal
respiratory and ATP production were also decreased due
to Lon down-regulation (p=0.003 and p=0.002, Figure 5E
and 5F), and which suggest that Lon may interact with
the complexes of ETC to regulate the complexes activities
given that the molecular chaperone properties of Lon
protease. Further work need to be done to uncover the
molecular mechanism of Lon regulating the bioenergetics
of bladder cancer cell. Together, these data suggest that
Lon may act as a vital modulator of cellular bioenergetics
in bladder cancer cells.

moderately (G2) (p=0.005) and poorly differentiated
(G3) (p<0.001) bladder cancer tissues (Figure 6C). And
it also showed a dramatically increase of Lon expression
in G3 group compared with that in G2 group (p<0.003) In
addition, we found that no statistical significance of Lon
expression in bladder cancer patients between TNM stage
I and II stage (p=0.303, Figure 6D) and as well as stage
II and stage III (p=0.143, Figure 6D);however, there is
significant difference in Lon expression for BC patients in
TNM stage I and III (p=0.024, Figure 6D). The association
between Lon protein expression and clinicopathological
characteristics of bladder cancer was analyzed by the
chi-square test. As shown in Table 1, high expression of
Lon was significantly associated with T stage (p=0.032),
histological grade (p<0.001), and TNM stage (p=0.032).
However, no significant relationship was found between
Lon protein expression and variables such as gender and
age.

To further assess whether Lon protein expression is
elevated in the tumor tissues and determine its association
with clinical and pathologic parameters of bladder cancer
patients, we performed immunohistochemical staining
(IHC) in TMA containing 132 archived paraffin-embedded
bladder cancer samples. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B,
most of the bladder cancer cells were positive stained,
though sporadic negative staining on these cells was
also observed and the intensity of the IHC staining was
variable. The corresponding integrated optical density
(IOD) value was quantified by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 and
shown in Figure 6C and 6D. Analyzed by one-way
ANOVA test, we found that Lon expression was lower
in well differentiated (G1) bladder cancer tissues than

Survival analysis

of clinicopathological factors in predicting survival of
bladder cancer patients, we analyzed the survival rate of
grade (p=0.0007) and TNM stage (p<0.001) as shown in
Figure 7A and 7F, respectively. Furthermore, in all three
grade groups, high Lon expression patients exhibited
significant lower survival rate in bladder cancer patients
diagnosed with G3 (p=0.0388, Figure 7D); however, Lon
expression plays no significant effect to the survival of
bladder cancer patients with grade 1 and grade 2 (Figure
7B, p=0.0809 and Figure 7C, p=0.1906 , respectively).
Additionally, overall survival of the bladder cancer
patients with high Lon expression in TNM Stage I and
II was much worse (Figure 7F, p=0.0359 and Figure
7G, p=0.0110, respectively). While Lon expression did
not predict outcome of TNM stage III bladder patients
(p=0.1757, Figureure7H). Taken together, these findings
indicate that Lon protein expression may be a useful
independent prognostic factor for bladder cancer.

The prognostic value of Lon for overall survival in
bladder cancer patients was evaluated by comparing the
patients with high and low Lon expression. According to
the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with high
Lon expression had obviously lower overall survival rates
than those with low Lon expression (Figure 6E, p<0.001).
Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using
Cox proportional hazards model to examine the impact of
Lon expression and other clinicopathological parameters
in bladder cancer patients. We found that Lon expression,
gender, tumor pathological grade, T stage and TNM
stage were significant prognostic factors in the univariate
analysis (Table 2). And we also performed multivariate
survival analysis by Cox proportional hazard model to
estimate the effects of independent factors on survival. As
shown in Table 2, multivariate analysis indicated that Lon
expression was one of the independent prognostic factors,
along with T and TNM stage.
In order to further understand the significance

DISCUSSION

mtDNA encoded subunit II of COX was degraded rapidly
and the steady-level of nuclear-encoded Subunit IV and
V of COX were also reduced under ER stress. During
hypoxia, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates the
LON gene transcription which up-regulates Lon protease
expression. Increased Lon protease degrades COX41 (isoform 1 of COX subunit 4) to facilitate the switch
from COX4-1 to more efficient COX4-2 to challenge the
low oxygen by enhancing mitochondrial respiration [17].
Thus, Lon protease mediated protein degradation can
relieve the heavy load of abnormal mitochondrial proteins
accumulation caused by ER tress and /or oxidative stress.
Our recent studies demonstrated that Lon expression
was increased in cervical cancer tissues and Lon may
serve as a potential therapeutic target in cervical cancer

There is growing evidence that mitochondrial Lon
protease plays a very active role in tumor progression.
The mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major source
of intracellular ROS, which may lead to the mitochondrial
dysfunction by oxidation of mtDNA, lipids, as well as
proteins. The protein quality control systems within
mitochondrial matrix are mainly contributed to the repair
or removal of the oxidized mitochondrial proteins to
maintain the mitochondria function well.
Expression of rat Lon is increased in response
to the oxidative or ER stress to regulate the important
processes within mitochondrial such as assembly and/or
degradation of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) [18]. The

[33]. In human lung fibroblast cells, damaged protein
aggregates rapidly in mitochondrial matrix when LON
gene expression was blocked [34, 35]. In addition,
transient down-regulation of Lon resulted in impaired
mitochondrial function and apoptosis of human WI38 VA-13 lung fibroblasts [21]. Human Lon protease
is highly expressed in adipose tissue from patients
with lipodystrophy, and the up-regulation is caused by
nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitor which induced
ROS production [36]. Previous studies showed that Lon
protease were up-regulated in human lung cancer cells and
malignant B-cell lymphoma cells [21, 22]. Our recently
published work shows that anti-cancer drug bortezomib
can block the TFAM degradation and increase mtDNA
copy numbers in cells with extremely low mtDNA by
inhibiting Lon protease activity [22].In human oral

cancer cell OEC-M1 and FADU, over-expression of Lon
protease resulted in the enhancing of mitochondrial ROS
generation, which is related to Lon-mediated up-regulation
of a mitochondrial Fe-S protein in complex I of electron
transport chain (NDUFS8) [28]. We speculate that Lon
may involve in bladder cancer progression, which could
serve as a novel diagnostic and /or prognostic biomarker
for BC, as well as signs of bladder cancer progression and
therapeutic target for the treatment of BC. To confirm our
hypothesis, we first analyzed expression profile of Lon in
bladder cancer cell lines, and found that Lon was steady
expressed in these bladder cancer cell lines both in protein
and mRNA level. In this study, we also showed that
both the Lon mRNA and protein expression levels were
significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than that in
adjacent normal tissues.

Maintenance of energy homeostasis is critical
for cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and
apoptosis. To investigate the role of Lon in bladder cancer
progression, we down-regulated the Lon expression
in bladder cancer cells ScaBER and UM-UC-3 using
siRNA, and we found that the down-regulation of
endogenous Lon reduced the cell proliferation of ScaBER
and UM-UC-3 cells, and decreased the cellular energy
metabolism. Down-regulation of Lon protease further
leads to the impairment to the assembly and/or function
of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and inhibits
the mitochondrial ROS production, and decreased ROS
level inhibits cancer cell proliferation, cell survival. In
addition, the growth inhibition of bladder cancer cells
could be partially attributed to the dysfunction of protein
quality control systems which causes cancer cells failed
to prevent mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to deficiency
of Lon protease and the decreased chaperone activity of
Lon, which resulting in the pernicious accumulation of
misfolded, unassembled and/or oxidatively damaged
proteins [21,37].
Over-expression of heat shock protein (HSP) family
member molecular chaperones as well as 26S proteasome
powered by ATP plays critical roles in assisting various
cancer cell growth and survival, and these chaperon
proteins may serve as nononcogenic protein target for
cancer therapy[38,39,40]. The ATP-dependent Lon
protease has similar function within mitochondrial matrix
to facilitate cells adapting to various proteotoxic stresses
related to oncogenesis. We proposed that Lon might also
be a potential anticancer drug target. To better understand
the roles of Lon protease as an anticancer drug target,
further investigations are required to clarify the molecular
mechanisms. Our data indicated that knockdown the Lon
enhances the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells UMUC-3 to doxorubicin by facilitating caspase-dependent
apoptosis. Moreover, down-regulation of Lon decreased
mitochondrial ROS production and blocks c-Jun
N-terminal kinases (JNK) activation, which suggest
that down-regulation of Lon reduce ROS production in
bladder cancer cells, and may cause the inhibition of
bladder cancer cell proliferation through suppression
JNK phosphorylation in ROS-induced MAPK pathway.
Altogether, these data suggest that Lon may play an
important role in bladder cancer progression via involving
in chemoresistance. Based on our results, we speculate
that inhibitors targeting Lon may be a potential strategy to
bladder cancer treatment.
To further investigate whether Lon expression might
be associated with the progression of bladder cancer, the
Lon protein expression levels and the clinic pathologic
characteristics of 132 patients with bladder cancer were
analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Our data indicate that
high Lon expression is significantly correlated with tumor
grade, T stage and TNM stage. Kaplan–Meier survival
analysis showed that high Lon expression is negatively
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

correlated with the overall survival of patients with bladder
cancer. More importantly, further analysis using the Cox
regression model confirmed that the Lon expression was
an independent factor in predicting overall survival time
for bladder cancer patients. These results suggest that Lon
might serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker for bladder
cancer patients after surgery and as a potential therapeutic
target in the treatment of bladder cancer. Our findings
show for the first time that the expression level of Lon
was up-regulated in bladder cancerous tissues, and reveal
an essential role for Lon protease in the tumorigenesis of
bladder cancer.
In conclusion, our study suggests that Lon supports
bladder tumorgenesis and may be a novel drug target and
prognostic marker of bladder cancer. These findings also
provide us a rationale for elucidating the role of ATPdependent Lon protease in other types of cancer and for
further attempts to block cancer cell proliferation and
increases chemosensitivity by inhibiting Lon protease
activity and decrease Lon expression. Finally, Lon may
also be a potential molecular marker for preoperative
chemotherapy treatment as well as for prediction of the
effectiveness of chemotherapy.

counting kit-8 (Beyotime, Jiangshu, China), respectively.
For MTT assay, UM-UC-3 and ScaBER cells were
seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1×105 cells/
well and incubated overnight. Cells were treated with a
concentration gradient of doxorubicin. After treatment
for12 h, cells were stained with MTT reagent (5 mg/ml)
(Beyotime, Jiangshu, China). After 4 h incubation with
MTT reagent, the crystals produced were then dissolved
with DMSO. Once the crystals were dissolved completely,
100 μL of solution were transferred to 96-well plate and
measured at 570 nm by plate reader (Thermo scientific,
USA)

Patients and samples
Samples from 45 tumors (each sample including
paired normal and tumor tissues from the same patient)
were obtained from untreated patients who underwent
surgical treatment for bladder cancer at Department of
Urology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou
Medical University, Wenzhou, China between 2006 and
2013. The patients age ranged from 35 to 86 years (mean
68.5 years). All the tissue samples were divided into two
parts. One part was embedded in paraffin and processed for
routine histopathological examination, and the remainder
tissue was immediately shock frozen in liquid nitrogen
and then stored at -80 ºC for later studies. All the patients
were clinically and pathologically confirmed to be bladder
cancer. The tumor stage and grade were defined according
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) /
Union InternationaleContre Cancer (UICC) and WHOclassification. This study was approved by the Board and
Ethical Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of
Wenzhou Medical University. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients participated in this study.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination
Intracellular ROS was measured by using
the fluorescence probe DCFH-DA according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR). Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 mM DCFHDA at 37 ºC for 20 min, followed by washing three times
with medium to remove extracellular DCFH-DA and
left appropriate volume of Serum free medium for flow
cytometry analysis. Next, mitochondrial superoxide
production was determined using MitoSOXTM Red regent
(5μM) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Fortyeight hour post transfection, 3 ×105 cells (control or Lon
siRNA UM-UC-3 cells) were seeded into 6 well-plates
and incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO for 24 h. Then, live-cell
imagers were taken with fluorescence microscopy.

RNAi and transfection

Doxorubicin-sensitivity assay

RNAi-mediated gene knockdown was done with
the 19-nucleotide targets using siRNAs (GenePharma,
Shanghai, China) as follows: Lon siRNA sense:
5´-GGAGCAGCUAAAGAUCAUCTT-3´ Lon siRNA
antisense: 5´-GAUGAUCUUUAGCUGCUCC TG-3´
Control siRNA sense: 5´-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG
UTT-3´ Control siRNA antisense: 5´- ACGUGACACGU
UCGGAGAATT-3´UM-UC-3 and SCaBER cells (2×105)
were transfected with a final concentration of 100 nmol/L
siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

UM-UC-3 cells were transfected with Lon and
negative control siRNA, and resuspended in DMEM
medium 24 h post transfection. Cells were then seeded into
6-well plate at a density of 4×105 cells/well and incubated
at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Next, cells were treated with
a concentration gradient of doxorubicin (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4μg/
μL).Then cells were collected and subjected to western
blotting with indicated antibodies

Cell proliferation and viability analysis

Each sample equivalent of 20 μg total protein
was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gels followed by
electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in Tris-glycine buffer. Blots
were blocked at room temperature for 1.5 h in blocking
buffer (3% non-fat milk in TBST) on a shaker, and then
incubated with primary antibodies specific to Lon and
β-actin overnight at 4 ºC, respectively. The membrane
was washed in TBST for 3×10 min and then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit
and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G at room temperature

Western blot analysis

UM-UC-3 and SCaBER cells transfected with
control and Lon siRNA, and cells were harvested and
resuspended in DMEM medium 24 h post transfection.

respectively.

Tissue
microarrays
(TMA)
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining

Total RNA was extracted from normal and
cancerous tissues of bladder cancer patients using Trizol
reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer`s instructions. Total RNA (2μg) was used
to synthesis first-strand cDNA by reverse transcription
using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser
(Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer`s
instructions. The RT reaction was subsequently used
as a template for real-time PCR. Real-time PCR assays
were performed using 2μL cDNA /20μL reaction
volume on a CFX connectTM real-time system (Bio-Rad)
using SYBR Green according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Primer sequences are as follows: forward:
5`-GCTGCTGAGAAGGAAAGTTCG-3`;
reverse:
5`-CGTGTGGTAGATTTCATCCAGG-3`.
Thermal
cycling was performed using the following parameters:
95 ºC for 10 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 ºC
for 10 s and extension at 60 ºC for 30 s. The threshold
cycle number (CT) was recorded for each reaction. The
CT value of Lon was normalized to that of β-actin. Each
sample was analyzed in triplicate and repeated 3 times.

RNA preparation and quantitative real-time PCR

and

Bladder cancer TMA containing a total of 132
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 μm
thickness) were constructed as described by Nocito et
al. [41]. IHC staining of TMA was performed according
to standard protocol. Briefly, the sections on TMA were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with a gradient
ethanol concentrations, the endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched, non-specific staining was blocked
by 5% normal goat serum, and followed by incubation
of TMA slides with ant-Lon antibody and also without
primary antibody (using PBS instead of anti-Lon) as a
negative control overnight at 4°C. The slides were then
incubated with biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig G and
further incubated with streptavidin peroxidase solution
(SABC kit, Boster, Wuhan, China). The staining was
visualized by reaction with 3, 3-di-aminobenzidine
(Boster, Wuhan, China) in PBS with 0.05% H2O2 for 5
min at room temperature and followed by counterstaining
with hematoxylin.

Oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis Assay

Assessment of IHC staining

The intact cellular oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)
were measured in real time using the Seahorse XF96
Extracellular Flux Analyser (Seahorse Bioscience, North
Billerica, MA, USA) as previous described [33]. Briefly,
1.0 ×104 of ScaBER or UM-UC-3 cells were seeded
into 96 well Seahorse microplates in 80 μL of growth
medium and incubated at 37 ºC in 5% CO2 for 24 h and
the the calibrator plate was equilibrated in a non-CO2
incubator overnight. Before starting the test, cells were
washed twice with assay running media (unbuffered
DMEM, 25mM glucose, 1mM glutamine, 1mM sodium
pyruvate) and equilibrated in a non-CO2 incubator. Once
the probe calibration was completed, the probe plate was
replaced by the cell plate. The protocol was optimized
and gave the measurement of oxygen consumption
rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)
simultaneously. Totally, the assay protocol incorporated
four compounds injection which could be applied to
modulate mitochondrial function to determine some of
the mitochondrial parameters, including basal respiration,
ATP production and maximal respiration. The analyzer
plotted the value of OCR and the corresponding ECAR
followed by injection of the compounds sequentially
as follows: oligomycin (1μM), an inhibitor of ATP
synthase which leads to exhibit maximal glycolysis

The TMA were reviewed and scored independently
by two pathologists who had no prior knowledge of the
clinicopathological features of the specimens on the TMA.
For IHC quantification, three random representative 400×
microscopic fields per section were photographed using
a standard Nikon Light Microscope. Then using imaging
analysis software Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (IPP) (Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD) for digital photographs
analysis by calculation of integrated optical density (IOD)
referencing the method introduced previously [42]. IOD,
the integral calculus of the stained area times the intensity
of staining in each pixel in the area, indicates the total
amount of staining material in that area. Lon protein
expression levels in the TMA were evaluated by scanning
the entire tissue microarrays.
The IHC staining of Lon was assessed according to
the immune-reactive score (IRS) as described previously
[43, 44], and adjusted slightly, which evaluated both the
percentage of positive cells and the staining intensity. The
percentage of positive cells was scored as 1 (≤10%), 2
(10-50%), 3 ( 50-80% ), 4 ( ≥80% )[45]; staining intensity
was graded as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate),
and 3 (strong). The two scores were multiplied and the
IRS (values from 0 to 12) was determined as ‘‘Low’’

Expression level of Lon was quantified relative to
β-actin, a loading control protein. The Lon expression level
of normal tissues was defined as 100%. The expression
levels of cancer tissues were a relative expression level
to normal tissues. All statistical analyses were performed
with the SPSS 13.0 statistical software package (SPSS
Standard version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used to analyze the significance of
protein and mRNA expression in normal and cancer tissues
of bladder. The χ2 test and one-way ANOVA analysis
were performed to evaluate the relationship between the
clinicopathological features and Lon expression in the
IHC results. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used
to evaluate patient’s prognosis. The overall survival rate
of the bladder cancer patients was obtained using the life
table method. A univariate analysis was plotted using the
Kaplan–Meier method. Cox regression analysis was used
to evaluate the relationship between molecular parameters
and the clinicopathological parameters; p≤0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
