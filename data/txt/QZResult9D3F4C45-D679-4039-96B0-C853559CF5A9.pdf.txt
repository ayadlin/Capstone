ABSTRACT
ATF3 was a transcription factor involved in the progression of certain cancers.
Here, we sought to explore the expression and biological function of ATF3 in
esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). The prognostic significance of ATF3
expression was evaluated in 150 ESCC samples and 21 normal squamous cell
epithelium tissues. Results showed that ATF3 was down-regulated in ESCC lesions
compared with paired non-cancerous tissues and low tumorous ATF3 expression
significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
(DFS). Cox regression analysis confirmed that ATF3 expression was an independent
prognostic factor. Experimentally, forced expression of ATF3 led to decreased growth
and invasion properties of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of
ATF3 did the opposite. Furthermore, ATF3 upregulated the expression of MDM2
by increasing the nuclear translocation of P53 and formed an ATF3/MDM2/MMP-2
complex that facilitated MMP-2 degradation, which subsequently led to inhibition of
cell invasion. Finally, we showed that Cisplatin could restrain the invasion of ESCC
cells by inducing the expression of ATF3 via P53 signaling. Combined, our findings
highlight a suppressed role for ATF3 in ESCC and targeting ATF3 might be a potential
therapeutic strategy.

cause of cancer related mortality [5]. Identification of
molecular markers associated with the progression of this
disease and understanding the key pathogenic processes
involved remain crucial for improving outcome.
Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a
member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors
[6]. It is an adaptive-response gene that participates in
cellular processes to adapt to extra- and/or intracellular
changes, where it transduces signals from various
receptors to activate or repress gene expression. ATF3 has

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one
of the most fatal malignancies worldwide. It is difficult to
diagnose ESCC at early stages of disease development,
and advanced ESCC frequently presents with extensive
local invasion or regional lymph node metastasis [1]. The
overall 5-year survival rate remains below 40% [2–4].
Metastatic tumors are often refractory or only partially
sensitive to current therapeutic strategies and the primary

been shown to dimerise with other ATF/CREB proteins,
including ATF2, c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D. Depending on
the promoter context, these heterodimers can act as either
repressors or activators of transcription. Therefore, the
role of ATF3 as a repressor or activator of transcription
cannot be generalized [7].
Recently, more and more evidence indicates that
ATF3 may play a critical role in the progression of cancer.
Interestingly, ATF3 has been demonstrated to play differing
roles in cancer development depending on the cell type
and context. ATF3 expression was found to be elevated
in several cancers such as breast cancer and Hodgkin
lymphomas [8, 9]. ATF3 may be oncogenic as it can be
protective against apoptosis and, in many cases, can also
promote metastasis of cell lines in vitro and in vivo [7]. In
contrast to these, ATF3 was found to be induced following
DNA damage in HCT-116 and RKO colon carcinoma
cells and suppressed the growth of HeLa cells [10]. Overexpression of ATF3 reduced the invasive potential of ovarian
cancer cells, bladder cancer cells and lung cancer cells
[11–13]. Moreover, ATF3 can be induced by a range of antitumorigenic compounds, including curcumin, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, and the phosphatidylinositol
inhibitor, LY294002 [14–16]. All these findings strongly
suggest that ATF3 may be a novel therapeutic target.
The expression pattern and possible function of
ATF3 in ESCC are still unclear. In the present study, we
sought to determine the role of ATF3 expression in ESCC
pathogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms.
We discovered a novel ATF3/MDM2/MMP-2 complex,
which was altered in ESCC and critically regulated ESCC
progression and metastasis.

ATF3 expression in 5 ESCC cell lines and
3 immortalized esophageal epithelial cell lines was also
determined by using Western blotting. Results showed that
ATF3 expressed in a low level in most of ESCC cell lines
evaluated whereas in a high level in the 3 immortalized
esophageal epithelial cell lines (Figure 1C). Confocal
scanning revealed that ATF3 was predominantly distributed
in the cytoplasm of ESCC cells (Figure 1D). Moreover, the
invasive capability of these cells was addressed by chamber
invasiveness assay and a negative correlation was found
between ATF3 expression and cell invasion (r = -0.77,
Pearson’s Correlation analysis, Figure 1E).

Impact of ATF3 expression on OS and DFS in
ESCC patients
To obtain a better understanding of the clinical
significance of ATF3 expression, we correlated its
expression in the cancerous tissues with a series of
clinicopathological features. As shown in Supplementary
Table S1, no significant associations were observed
between ATF3 expression and the clinicopathological
features indicated.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that
ATF3 positive expression predicted significantly better
OS (P=0.006) and DFS (P=0.001) (Figure 2A and 2B).
The median survival time of patients whose primary
ESCC scored high for ATF3 expression was more than
80 months whereas negative ATF3 expression correlated
with a shortened median survival time of about 35 months.
Supplementary Table S2 summarizes the results
of the univariate analysis of prognostic variables. The
following factors were significantly associated with the
survival of patients besides ATF3 expression: regional
lymph node metastasis (OS, P=0.002, DFS, P=0.001) and
pTNM-stage (OS, P=0.047, DFS, P=0.02). Moreover,
multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that ATF3
expression was an independent positive prognostic factor
for ESCC patients (Supplementary Table S2).

RESULTS
Reduced ATF3 expression in ESCC versus
non-cancer tissues
We first examined the expression of ATF3 in the
progression from normal epithelium to carcinoma of the
esophagus by using immunohistochemical staining. ATF3
was positive-expression in all cases of normal squamous
cell epithelium in a cytoplasm-staining pattern (100%,
21/21). It was absent in the basal layer and strongly
positive in the intermediate and superficial layers. In
simple hyperplasia (75%, 6/8), mild dysplasia and
moderate dysplasia (70%, 7/10), ATF3 was also present in
the intermediate and superficial layers, whereas in severe
dysplasia (71.4%, 5/7), positive staining was only observed
in the superficial layers (Figure 1A). Comparatively,
ATF3expression was significantly decreased in ESCC
samples, showing a positive-expression rate of 51.3%
(77/150) (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, decreased
expression of ATF3 was also found in human ESCC tissues
compared with the paired normal tissues from the patients
as shown by Western blotting analysis (Figure 1B).

Effect of ATF3 expression on cell growth and
invasion in vitro
To assess the functional role of ATF3 expression
in ESCC cells, we over-expressed ATF3 in EC109 and
KYSE510 and then determined the effect exerted by
forced expression of ATF3 on cell growth and invasion.
Two clones in each cell line with high expression of ATF3
are shown in Figure 3A, which were used for further study.
Colony formation assay, MTT assay and invasiveness
assay revealed that ATF3 over-expression dramatically
reduced cell growth and invasive properties in both
EC109 cells and KYSE510 cells compared with control
cells (Figure 3B and 3C, Supplementary Figure S2).
The effect of ATF3 on cell growth and invasion was
further confirmed in KYSE150 cells by using RNAi

method. Results showed that with ATF3 knockdown,
both of cell growth and invasion were promoted. Further
analysis revealed that re-expression of ATF3 in the ATF3silencing cells led to a 50% restoration of cell growth
whereas resulted in a totally inversion of cell invasion
(Figure 3D, 3E and 3F, Supplementary Figure S2). These
findings suggested that effect of ATF3 on cell invasion was
greater than that on cell growth, which prompted us to
conduct further research on the molecular mechanisms of
ATF3 role in cancer invasion.

To determine whether ATF3 plays an important
role in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of ESCC cells,
we injected ATF3-transfected EC109 cells or the control
cells into the subcutis of nude mice or via tail veins of
SCID mice. Consistent with the effect of ATF3 expression
on the growth and invasion of ESCC cells in vitro, ATF3

(Figure 4A and 4B, Supplementary Figure S3). Moreover,
in the metastasis model, cancer cells spreading into lung of
mice was shown by H&E-staining. Number and size of the
metastatic colonization were dramatically decreased on
the lung surface of ATF3-transfected cells implanted mice
compared to the control mice (Figure 4C, 4D and 4E).
These data suggested that ATF3 inhibited tumorigenesis
and metastasis of ESCC cells in vivo.

a transcription factor, ATF3 might affect cell biological
behaviors by regulating the expression of certain target
genes. Hence, the expressions of several potential molecules
downstream of ATF3 including Cyclin D1, β-catenin,
MMP-2 and MMP-9 [7], were addressed by using Western
blotting. Results showed that the protein levels of MMP-2
and β-catenin were increased with ATF3 over-expression
(Supplementary Figure S4, Figure 5A). Based on the
established role of MMP-2 in cancer metastasis, we selected
MMP-2 for further study. Effect of ATF3 on MMP-2
expression was confirmed in KYSE510 cells and KYSE150
cells (Figure 5A). Zymography analysis of the conditioned
media obtained from cells showed that the activity of
MMP-2 was significantly lower in ATF3 over-expression
cells and higher in ATF3 siRNA-treated cells, respectively

(Figure 5B). Immunohistochemical analysis on the
subcutaneous tumor tissues also confirmed that MMP-2 was
decreased upon ATF3 expression (Figure 5C). However,
results of real-time RT-PCR showed that the mRNA level
of MMP-2 did not change with the alteration of ATF3
expression, suggesting that ATF3 did not regulate MMP-2
expression in transcriptional level (Figure 5D). To explore
the role of MMP-2 in the ATF3-mediated cellular function,
siRNA targeted ATF3 and siRNA targeted MMP-2 were

the increased invasion capability of ESCC cells resulted
from ATF3 silencing, indicating that MMP-2 might be
a major effector of ATF3-mediated suppression of cell
invasion (Figure 5E and 5F).

ATF3 mediated the degradation of MMP-2 in a
MDM2 dependent manner
Next, to explore whether the ATF3-mediated reducedexpression of MMP-2 reflected altered MMP-2 protein
stability, we treated the cells with MG132 (proteosome

inhibitor) and NH4Cl (lysosome inhibitor) and the
expression of MMP-2 in these cell was addressed. Results
showed that protein level of MMP-2 was recovered in ATF3
over-expression cells when treated with MG132 but did not
change when treated with NH4Cl, indicating that ATF3
might affect the degradation of MMP-2 through proteosome
pathway (Figure 6A).
Previous studies have shown that ATF3 increased
P53 stability and nuclear translocation and sequentially
activated the transcription of mouse double minute
2 (MDM2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase [17, 18]. We
therefore detected the expression of MDM2 in our
cell models. Both Western blotting analysis on cell
lysates and Immunohistochemical staining on the

subcutaneous tumor tissues revealed that MDM2 were
up-regulated with ATF3 forced expression (Figure 6B
and 6C). In addition, nuclear expression of P53 was
increased while the total P53 was unchanged in the
ATF3 expressing cells, demonstrating that ATF3 may
up-regulate MDM2 via P53 (Figure 6B). Further
analysis by employing co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)
showed that the ubiquitination of MMP-2 was increased
in MG132-treated cells, but when treated with MDM2
inhibitor or with both MDM2 inhibitor and MG132, the
ubiquitination of MMP-2 was abolished and the protein
level of MMP-2 was restored (Figure 6D). These findings
suggested that ATF3 might mediate the degradation of
MMP-2 in a MDM2 dependent manner.

Cisplatin suppressed the invasion of ESCC cells
by targeting ATF3

To analyze the relationship among ATF3, MDM2
and MMP-2, an antibody against MMP-2 was subjected
to co-IP experiment. Results revealed that the reciprocal
protein complexes involving ATF3, MDM2 and MMP-2
could be detected in the ATF3 over-expression cells.
Treatment of the cells with MG132 resulted in increased
formation of the complex whereas treatment with MDM2
inhibitor did the opposite, confirming the existence of
ATF3/MDM2/MMP-2 complex (Figure 6E). Moreover,
we also found that ATF3 expression was regulated
by MDM2-mediated proteosome pathway which was
consistent with other studies (Figure 6E) [18].

Finally, to determine whether the ATF3 was a
target of cancer therapy, we treated the ESCC cells with
Cisplatin, which is the most active antitumor agent used
in human chemotherapy. The cytotoxic effect of Cisplatin
on EC109 cells was analyzed by using MTT assay. Higher
doses of Cisplatin exhibited obvious cytotoxicity to
EC109 cells after treatment for 48 h and 72 h (Figure 7A).
Then, a time-course experiment was conducted to gain
insight into the kinetics of ATF3 protein expression upon

Cisplatin treatment (4µg/ml). Samples were collected
at six time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h) and significant
ATF3 induction was found after 12 h of treatment. With
the treatment of Cisplatin, MDM2 was up-regulated
and MMP-2 was down-regulated (Figure 7B). P53 and
ERK/MAPK pathways were previously reported to be
involved in the Cisplatin-induced expression of ATF3
[19]. We found here that the activity of ERK/MAPK was
unchanged while P53 expression was increased upon
Cisplatin treatment, suggesting that Cisplatin might induce
ATF3 via P53 (Figure 7B, Supplementary Figure S5).
Results of Co-IP assay showed that, when treated with
both MG132 and Cisplatin, formation of ATF3/MDM2/
MMP-2 complex was increased, whereas MDM2 inhibitor
treatment impeded the complex formation (Figure 7C).
Moreover, invasiveness assay and MTT assay revealed
that Cisplatin inhibited the invasion and growth of
ESCC cells, and ATF3 knockdown was able to partially
reverse this inhibition (Figure 7D, 7E and 7F). These data
indicated that Cisplatin might suppress the invasion of
ESCC cells by inducing the expression of ATF3.

manner. Fourth, Cisplatin could suppress the invasion of
ESCC cells by inducing the expression of ATF3 via P53
signaling. Therefore, we propose a new model for ATF3
as a novel suppressor of tumor invasion and metastasis in
ESCC (Figure 8).
ATF3 gene is located on human chromosome 1q32
within a region that is found to be frequently amplified in
solid tumors [20]. In ESCC, a previous study showed that
in the 29 cell lines that were analyzed, only one cell line
(KYSE150) presented ATF3 amplification [21]. Hence,
whether the ATF3 gene is amplified or not in ESCC,
especially in tissues needs further exploration. Herein, we
firstly showed the reduced expression of ATF3 protein in
ESCC and further revealed that ATF3 low-expression was
associated with decreased survival. To our knowledge, this
is the first report on the effect of ATF3 on the prognosis of
ESCC patients. ATF3 has been demonstrated to be downregulated in several types of tumors such as colon cancer
and ovarian cancer [10, 11]. However, in prostate cancer
and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, ATF3 was found to be overexpressed and act as an oncogene, indicating that ATF3
may play differing roles in cancer development depending
on the cell type [9, 22]. Much still remains to be learned
about the complex roles of ATF3 in the context of tumor
progression.
Invasion and metastasis has been shown to be one
of the most important hallmarks of cancer [23]. ATF3 was
discovered to be involved in cell invasion and metastasis
of human ovarian cancer cells, lung cancer, and bladder
cancer [11–13]. In current study, we showed that ATF3
expression decreased the invasive potential and suppressed
the lung metastasis of ESCC cells, suggesting ATF3
might play as a metastasis suppressor. Moreover, lines
of evidence suggest that ATF3 is essential for cell cycle
progression. It was reported that ATF3 over-expression

DISCUSSION
In this study, we discovered four lines of evidence
supporting a critical role for ATF3 in ESCC progression.
First, we found a down-regulated ATF3 expression in
ESCC, which was significantly associated with both
OS and DFS of ESCC patients. ATF3 might serve as an
independent prognostic factor. Second, forced expression
of ATF3 led to decreased cell growth and invasive
properties in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of
ATF3 did the opposite. Third, ATF3 suppressed the
expression of MMP-2 by mediating the degradation of
MMP-2 via proteosome pathway in a MDM2 dependent

resulted in increased apoptosis of PC3 human prostate
cancer cells, reduced focus formation, and reduced size
of subcutaneous HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cell
xenografts in nude mice [24, 25]. Consistently, the present
study also showed over-expression of ATF3 suppressed the
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo while ATF3 silencing did
the opposite, supporting an important role for ATF3 in cell
proliferation. Intriguingly, we found that effect of ATF3 on
cell invasion was greater than that on cell growth, which
prompted us to focus our studies on ATF3 role in cancer
invasion.
Abnormal expression of ATF3 may mediate multiple
aspects of cancer biology by repressing the transcription
of certain downstream molecules including Cyclin D1,
Id1 and IRS2 [7]. Our results suggested that the protein
level and activity of MMP-2, a Type IV collagenase which
was critical in cancer cell invasion and metastasis [26],
was attenuated in the ATF3-expressing cells, suggesting
that MMP-2 might be a downstream molecule of ATF3
function. Systemic metastases arise from tumor cells that
disseminate via the blood and lymphatic vasculature.
MMPs were shown to be essential for blood vessel
invasion, but not lymphatic vessel invasion [27–29]. Here,
we found that there was no correlation between ATF3
expression and lymph node metastasis in the analysis with
clinical samples, whereas in vivo experiments showed that
ATF3 expression was associated with lung metastasis. We
proposed that ATF3 might inhibit the blood vessel invasion
of ESCC cells by affecting the expression of MMP-2.
Previous study on human fibrosarcoma cells showed
that ATF3 repressed MMP-2 expression by decreasing the
transactivation of this gene [30]. However, we reported
here that ATF3 suppressed the expression of MMP-2 by
inducing the MDM2-mediated degradation, indicating
that regulation of ATF3 on MMP-2 might have different
mechanism in cells from different histological origin.
Rapid degradation of specific proteins by ubiquitin/
proteasome-dependent pathways is a component of many
cellular regulatory mechanisms and emerging evidences
suggested that degradation of protein plays important
role in the progression of cancer [31]. MDM2, an E3
ubiquitin ligase, is known as oncogene for the ability to
ubiquitylate P53 and lead to its proteasomal degradation
[32]. However, it is believed that MDM2 has tumor
suppressor functions by inducing cell cycle arrest or
targeting Slug, a key transcriptional regulator in the EMT
progression for proteolytic degradation [33, 34]. We found
that ATF3 could increase the nuclear translocation of P53,
and sequentially upregulate the expression of MDM2.
Then, the formation of a complex including ATF3, MDM2
and MMP-2 was increased and thus facilitated MMP2 degradation. All these findings indicated that ATF3
might inhibit the invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells
by inducing the degradation of MMP-2. Study on the
precise mechanism of the ATF3/MDM2/MMP-2 complex
is underway.

Cisplatin is a clinically highly relevant anticancer
drug used for the treatment of esophageal cancer. The
known mechanism underlying its antitumor activity
has been ascribed to the induction of DNA damage
by platinum compounds and defining the specific
mechanism(s) responsible for the antitumor affects of
Cisplatin may lead to novel and improved therapeutic
approaches [35]. Cisplatin was also reported to activate
ATF3 through MAPK pathways or P53 signaling and
ATF3 was important for Cisplatin’s cytotoxicity [36].
Here, we confirmed the Cisplatin-induced expression of
ATF3 via P53 and further showed that Cisplatin might
suppress the invasion of ESCC cells by targeting the
ATF3/MDM2/MMP-2 complex, suggesting that ATF3 is
a potential treatment target in the chemotherapy of ESCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue specimens and immunohistochemical
staining
Surgically removed tumors embedded in paraffin
wax blocks from 150 ESCC cases, 21 paired adjacent
normal epithelial tissues, 8 simple hyperplasia cases,
10 mild dysplasia or moderate dysplasia cases and
7 severe dysplasia cases were retrieved from the archives
of the Department of Pathology of the Central Hospital
of Shantou City, P.R. China. The cases were received
between 1987 and 1999. The cases were selected in this
study only if a follow-up was obtained and clinical data
were available. The follow-up for patients after esophageal
resection was continued until their deaths and only patients
died from ESCC were included in the tumor-related
deaths. The patients, suffering from severe post-operative
complications, other tumors or died of other causes were
excluded. For the use of these clinical materials for research
purposes, we obtained prior consent from all patients and
the study was approved by the ethical committee of the
Central Hospital of Shantou City and the ethical committee
of the Medical College of Shantou University.
The clinicopathologic data are summarized in
Supplementary Table S3. Patients were staged according
to AJCC Cancer Staging Manual for esophageal
Carcinoma, 6th Edition, 2002. All specimens were fixed in
10% formaldehyde solution, embedded in paraffin blocks,
and selected to build tissue microarrays as described [37].
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed as described elsewhere [37]. The S
­ uperPicTure
Polymer Detection kit and the Liquid Substrate kit
(­
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to carry out
­immunohistochemistry according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Rabbit anti-human ATF3 polyclonal antibody
(Rockland, Pennsylvania, USA) and Mouse anti-human
ATF3 polyclonal antibody (ABGENT, San Diego, USA)
were used. Each section was independently assessed by two
histopathologists without prior knowledge of patient data.

intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate

system, the maximum score was 12. Scores 0–4 was
categorized as “negative” and scores 5–12 as “positive”
for the statistical analysis.

Whole-cell lysates and nuclear protein were
prepared from ESCC cells as described previously [38].
Standard Western blotting analysis of the lysates was
performed with antibodies against ATF3 (Rockland),
β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), MMP-2 (Thermo,
San Jose, CA, USA), MDM2 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
P53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Shanghai, China),
p-ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz), or Ub (Santa Cruz). For
co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies, cells were grown
in 10-cm-diameter tissue culture dishes. After treatment
of MG132 (Calbiochem), MDM inhibitor (Santa Cruz) or
Cisplatin (Hanson, Jiangshu, China), cells were lysed and
the resulting supernatants were incubated on a rocker with
1 μg MMP-2 antibody for 1 h and then with 20 μl protein
A/G PLUS Agarose (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4°C. The
immunoprecipitates were collected and then subjected to
SDS/PAGE analysis.

Cell cultures
ESCC cell line EC171 and three immortalized
esophageal epithelial cell lines (NE1, NE2 and NEcA6)
were provided by professor Sai-Wah Tsao (Department
of Anatomy, University of Hong Kong, China). Other
four ESCC cell lines, EC109, KYSE150, EC9706 and
KYSE510 were provided by professor Ming-Zhou Guo
(Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Chinese
PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China). The immortalized
esophageal epithelial cell lines were cultured in a
1:1 mixture of defined keratinocyte serum-free medium
(Invitrogen) and EpiLife (Cascade Biologics, Portland,
Oregon). The ESCC cells were cultured in DMEM
medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. All
cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in air.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy
The staining procedure was performed as described
[39]. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, cells
were incubated with donkey serum blocking buffer and
a primary antibody, followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(DyLight 488) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove,
PA, USA). Samples were counter-stained with DAPI
(Sigma) and the cells were finally examined under a
confocal microscope (OLYMPUS, FV-1000).

Primers, siRNA and transfection

Cell growth study

To generate the ATF3 expression vector, the
open reading frame (ORF) of human ATF3 cDNA was
cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.0
­(Invitrogen). For siRNA-mediated knockdown experiment, siRNA targeted 3’-UTR of ATF3 gene (siATF3),
siRNA targeted ORF of MMP-2 gene (siMMP-2) and
negative control siRNA (siControl) were purchased
from QIAGEN (Germantown, MD, USA). For real time
RT-PCR of MMP-2, the following primers were used:
5’-AGATCTTCTTCTTCAAGGACCGGTT-3’ (forward) and: 5’-GGCTGGTCAGTGGCTTGGGGTA-3’
(reverse).
The plasmid or siRNA was transfected into ESCC
cells using HiPerFect reagent (QIAGEN). For the
restored-expression of ATF3, siATF3 and ATF3 expression
plasmid were co-transfected into KYSE150 cells. The
transfected cells were harvested 48 h later and used for
further analysis. In animal experiment, stable transfected
clones were used. Briefly, G418 (400 μg/ml, Calbiochem,
Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the culture medium
24 h after transfection. Stable G418-resistant clones were
obtained in 7–9 days. The expanded cells were then used
for in vivo studies.

The colony formation assay and MTT assay were
used to evaluate cell growth. For MTT assay, cells were
seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well), and after
incubation for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h or 96 h, MTT solution
(5 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to the medium. The formazan
crystals that formed were dissolved, and absorption was
measured at 490 nm with an automatic ELISA reader.
In the colony formation assay, cells were plated at a
density of 200 cells/well in 6-well plates. They were then
moved to a cell incubator. After 10 days, the number of
colony-forming cells (>50 cells) was calculated under a
microscope. The data were expressed as mean ± SD.

Gelatin zymography
Cells were washed and cultured in serum-free
199 medium. After 24 h, the conditioned medium from
107 cells was collected, concentrated 50-fold using a
Nanosep 10K centrifugal device (Pall Corporation,
Washington, USA), and subjected to SDS–PAGE through
10% polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with 1 mg/ml
gelatin (Sigma). Gels were incubated overnight at 37°C

and then stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue R250. After
destaining, gelatinolytic signals were photographed. The
coomassie staining of total protein in conditioned media
were used to demonstrate that equal numbers of cells were
present during the conditioning of the media.

Cell invasiveness assay
Invasiveness assay was performed as described
before [39]. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were seeded onto the
top chamber of a 24-well Matrigel-coated membrane with
8-µm pores (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA), and
the bottom chamber was filled with medium containing
10% fetal calf serum. The membranes were fixed and
stained by Giemsa reagent 24 h later and invasive cells
were quantified by counting 10 random fields under a light
microscope (400×). The mean value was calculated from
data obtained from three separate chambers.

For tumorigenesis experiments, 1 × 106 ATF3
forced-expression EC109 cells or control cells were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the nude
mice (male, 6 weeks old, 12 in each group). After 30
days of observation, the mice were sacrificed and the
tumors were removed and weighed. In experimental lung
metastasis experiments, two age-matched groups of SCID
mice (male, 6 weeks old, 10 in each group) were injected
with the indicated cells (1.2 × 107) in 0.2 ml serum-free
medium via tail veins. These mice were kept 28 days
until they were sacrificed. Lungs of the SCID mice
were removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for
examination by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining.
All these mice were raised in specified pathogenfree conditions (26°C, 70% relative humidity, and a 12-h
light/dark cycle). The use of animals complied with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
publication no. 86-23, revised 1985) and current Chinese
law on the protection of animals.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons between data sets were performed
using the χ2 test or the Mann-Whitney U test. Overall
survival (OS) was measured from the date of surgery to
death from any cause. Disease-free survival (DFS) was
measured from the date of surgery to disease progression
or relapse. Probabilities of OS and DFS were calculated
by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared using the logrank test. Relative risk was evaluated by the multivariate
COX proportional hazards model. A two-tailed P
value less than 0.05 was considered to have statistical
significance. All statistical tests were performed with
SPSS statistic software (SPSS® 14.0 by SPSS Inc).
