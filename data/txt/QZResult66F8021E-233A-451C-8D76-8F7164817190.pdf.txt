Ganetespib and HSP90: Translating Preclinical Hypotheses
into Clinical Promise
David A. Proia and Richard C. Bates

Abstract
As with many physiologic processes that become subverted during tumorigenesis, the chaperoning activity of
heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is often exploited by cancer cells to confer aberrant proliferative, survival, and/or
metastatic potential. Functional inhibition of HSP90 results in the degradation of its client proteins, in turn
providing a means to concomitantly disrupt multiple oncogenic signaling cascades through one molecular target.
Pharmacologic blockade of HSP90 has, therefore, emerged as an innovative and multifaceted approach for the
development of new antineoplastic agents. However, no HSP90 inhibitors are currently approved for cancer
therapy and the full promise of this class of agents is yet to be realized. This review focuses on the preclinical
activity proﬁle of ganetespib, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of HSP90, the characterization of which has
provided important frameworks for the optimal design and application of HSP90 inhibitor–based strategies in a
variety of cancer types. Beyond client protein–driven tumors, ganetespib can also potentiate the effects of other
molecularly targeted and standard-of-care therapeutics while simultaneously overcoming drug resistance in
multiple tumor types, thereby positioning this compound as the leading HSP90 inhibitor currently under clinical
development. Cancer Res; 74(5); 1294–300. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
From an unlikely candidate to one of the most actively
pursued drug targets in oncology, the molecular chaperone
heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) represents a promising point for
therapeutic intervention in cancer due to its essential role in
regulating the maturation and functional stability of an extensive array of client proteins that contribute to nearly every
aspect of the oncogenic process, including immortality, prosurvival/antiapoptosis, metabolism, genomic instability, and
dissemination (1). Unlike traditional targeted therapies (e.g.,
kinase inhibition) that selectively ablate one or a few oncoproteins, inhibition of HSP90 activity results in the destabilization of hundreds of cellular clients (2), thus providing a
means to simultaneously disrupt multiple oncogenic signaling
cascades through a singular molecular target.
Originally, HSP90 was not considered an intuitive candidate
for therapeutic targeting. The chaperoning function of the
molecule is equally critical for normal physiologic and homeostatic processes and, indeed, genetic knockout is lethal (3).
This proﬁle would thus be expected to contribute to a high
likelihood of systemic toxicities. However, during the identiﬁcation and characterization of pharmacologic inhibitors of
HSP90, it was discovered that as a class, these compounds
displayed preferential and selective tumor retention (reviewed

in ref. 4). Although the mechanisms remain to be fully
elucidated, a model has emerged that HSP90 exists in tumor
cells in a highly active, multichaperone complex that exhibits
greater afﬁnity for targeted inhibitors than that observed in
normal cells (4).
The prototypical class of HSP90 inhibitors contains the
natural product ansamycin, including geldanamycin and its
derivatives 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)
and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG). While characterization of these compounds
delivered critical proof-of-concept evidence for targeted HSP90
inhibition as an effective strategy for cancer treatment, their
clinical application was hampered by a number of pharmacologic and safety limitations. Since then, an increasing number of
synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of HSP90 have been developed based on a diverse variety of chemical scaffolds (5). This
review focuses on the preclinical activity proﬁle of ganetespib,
an investigational drug that has provided important frameworks for the design of new HSP90 inhibitor-based therapies in
the clinical management of multiple human malignancies.

Ganetespib: An HSP90 Inhibitor with Favorable
Potency, Activity, and Tolerability
Similar to the majority of small-molecule HSP90 inhibitors
currently in development, ganetespib exhibits competitive
binding with the N-domain ATP-binding pocket of HSP90,
disrupting the chaperone cycle. Ganetespib belongs to the
resorcinol-based group of synthetic, second-generation HSP90
inhibitors that include NVP-AUY922, AT-13387, and KW-2478;
however, its chemical structure contains a unique triazolone
moiety (6). With a molecular weight of 364.4, the compound is
considerably smaller than the ansamycins and most second-

Antitumor Activity of Ganetespib

generation HSP90 inhibitors. This agent displayed a 20-fold
superior potency to 17-AAG in a panel of 57 transformed cell
lines of both hematologic and solid tumors (6) with in vitro
activity typically in the low nanomolar range comparable to
NVP-AUY922 (7). Ganetespib is preferentially retained in
tumor tissues over normal tissues, with a half-life of more
than 58 hours in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft
tumors compared with 3 hours in plasma and 5 to 6 hours in
normal liver and lung (8). Similar drug accumulation has
previously been demonstrated for 17-AAG and 17-DMAG in
ovarian and breast xenograft models, respectively (9, 10).
Overall, these characteristics combine to promote extensive
penetration, distribution, and retention of ganetespib throughout solid tumors in in vivo models (6).
Favorable pharmacologic properties further distinguish
ganetespib from other ﬁrst- and second-generation inhibitors
in terms of safety and tolerability. Structurally, ganetespib
lacks the benzoquinone chemical moiety believed responsible,
at least in part, for the dose-limiting hepatotoxicity that is a
characteristic of the geldanamycin analogs. When the hepatotoxicity proﬁle of ganetespib was directly compared with
that of 17-DMAG in a rat model, no changes in the liver
enzymes aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase were observed following repeat dosing of ganetespib,
even at levels above its efﬁcacious dose range. In stark contrast,
a dose-dependent and marked elevation of liver enzymes and
histologic liver damage was seen in 17-DMAG–treated rats, at
doses 12.5 times lower than ganetespib (6). In addition, drugrelated ocular toxicity has emerged as an undesirable side
effect of some newer HSP90-targeted agents, such as NVPAUY922 and SNX-5422. Using a rodent model to assess the
retinotoxicity potential of HSP90 inhibitors, we recently uncovered a relationship between photoreceptor degeneration with
retinal drug distribution and retention (11). Unlike NVPAUY922, ganetespib did not accumulate in the rat eye and
was rapidly eliminated from retinal tissues. As a result, ganetespib did not induce extensive photoreceptor cell death as
seen following NVP-AUY922 exposure (11). These ﬁndings are
consistent with the clinical safety proﬁle of ganetespib, which
has shown only a minor incidence of visual disorders in more
than 800 patients treated to date.

Single-Agent Activity of Ganetespib in Client
Protein–Driven Tumor Types
It is now established that human tumors may become
"oncogenically addicted" to mutated, overexpressed, and/or
chimeric kinases for growth and survival. Importantly, many of
these same proteins are HSP90 clients, for example, HER2
(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) in breast cancer,
mutant EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) or ALK
(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) translocations in NSCLC,
mutant KIT in gastrointestinal tumors (GIST), and mutated
BRAF in melanoma (for review, see ref. 12). Thus, a reasonable
approach for evaluating the potential of single-agent HSP90
inhibitor therapy has involved the selection of tumor types
expressing such modiﬁcations to exploit their client protein–
driver dependence on HSP90 (Fig. 1A).

Gene rearrangements of ALK, most commonly with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), act as
oncogenic drivers in a molecularly deﬁned subset of NSCLC.
Indeed, the clinical success of the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) crizotinib in this patient population serves as a paradigm
for molecularly targeted therapy in general. Because the
EML4–ALK fusion protein is an established HSP90 client, we
evaluated the possibility of targeting the chaperone function of
HSP90 with ganetespib as an alternative approach to direct
kinase inhibition in ALK-driven lung cancer (13). Not unexpectedly, ganetespib treatment resulted in the loss of EML4–
ALK expression and depletion of multiple oncogenic signaling
cascades in NSCLC cell lines harboring the rearrangement,
consistent with previous reports for 17-AAG and its watersoluble derivate IPI-504 (14, 15). However, when directly compared with crizotinib, ganetespib exhibited signiﬁcantly greater in vitro potency, superior antitumor efﬁcacy, and prolonged
animal survival in xenograft models (13). Thus, the multimodal
effects of ganetespib on both ALK itself and other HSP90modulated signaling cascades provided more complete and
durable responses compared with kinase inhibition alone. The
translational implications of these ﬁndings have already been
established in clinical trials in which durable objective tumor
responses were observed in patients with NSCLC who were
undergoing IPI-504 or ganetespib monotherapy, whose tumors
harbored ALK rearrangements (16, 17). Furthermore, oncogenic rearrangements of two additional kinases, ROS1 and
RET, were also acutely sensitive to HSP90 inhibition by ganetespib (13). Similar to ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions are emerging
as promising molecular targets in genomic subsets of NSCLC
and, as the clinical signiﬁcance of these putative oncogenic
drivers becomes realized, pharmacologic blockade by ganetespib warrants further investigation as a therapeutic approach.
In breast cancer, considerable experimental evidence exists
that shows that HER2-overexpressing (HER2þ) tumors are
particularly susceptible to HSP90 inhibition (18). Moreover,
clinical beneﬁt was achieved in a phase II trial evaluating 17AAG in combination with trastuzumab (an approved biologic
inhibitor of HER2) in patients with metastatic HER2þ breast
cancer who had progressed on prior trastuzumab therapy
alone (19). The clinical development of 17-AAG has subsequently been halted; thus, it seems that a therapeutic opportunity exists within this patient group for an effective and
tolerable alternate HSP90 inhibitor. In this regard, the preclinical activity proﬁle of ganetespib in HER2þ breast cancer
encompasses both potent oncogene inhibition and durable
response properties, features that would support the use of
intermittent dosing schedules in the clinical setting (20).
More recently, it has emerged that the pleiotropic effects of
HSP90 inhibition may also offer considerable potential for the
treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a high-risk
subset of breast tumors characterized by aggressive behavior,
poor prognosis, and a lack of targeted therapeutic options.
Unlike HER2þ or hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, this
heterogeneous collection of tumors lacks a unifying molecular
characteristic to serve as a druggable target. In accordance
with ﬁndings for the small-molecule inhibitors PU-H71 and PF4942847 (21, 22), the multimodal action of ganetespib results in

Antitumor Activity of Ganetespib

robust antineoplastic activity in in vitro and in vivo TNBC
models (23). Furthermore, ganetespib exposure suppresses
lung colonization and tumor growth in syngeneic mouse
models of experimental and spontaneous metastasis (23). This
antimetastatic feature of the compound has been strikingly
reinforced by clinical observations of marked tumor shrinkage
of lung and lymphatic lesions in patients with TNBC undergoing ganetespib monotherapy (23). These dramatic responses
suggested that the metastatic tumors were acutely reliant on
the chaperoning activity of HSP90, with one or more HSP90dependent signaling pathways driving their growth and survival. A number of molecular alterations have been incompletely validated as therapeutic targets in triple-negative disease (24) and, among these, molecules such as EGFR, KIT,
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), and members of the
DNA-repair pathway are established HSP90 clients. While the
challenge remains to identify which speciﬁc client proteins
may ultimately serve as predictive biomarkers for those cancers likely to respond to HSP90 inhibitor treatment, our ﬁndings underscore the therapeutic potential of ganetespib for
treatment of metastatic disease in patients with TNBC.

Combinatorial Activity
Despite the encouraging clinical activity seen in ALK-driven
and HER2-ampliﬁed disease, similar translational beneﬁt
remains to be achieved with HSP90-inhibitor monotherapy in
other client protein–driven patient populations. For example,
GIST is a tumor type that may be considered particularly
amenable to HSP90 inhibitor–directed therapy due to the high
frequency of activating KIT mutations that drive tumorigenesis. However, prolonged inhibition of this client or its downstream pathways was not observed following targeted HSP90
blockade in either preclinical models or patient biopsies, and
consequently only limited efﬁcacy was seen in a phase II trial
evaluating weekly administration of ganetespib to patients
with GIST (25). HSP90 inhibitors are likely then to be most
effective in such scenarios when used as part of combination
treatments. In this regard, ganetespib has been found to
potentiate the activity of standard-of-care chemotherapeutics
and other molecularly targeted agents in a variety of human
cancers, thus providing compelling rationales for the exploration of this compound as part of novel combinatorial treatment strategies.
Taxanes are antimitotic agents and represent one of the
most widely used classes of chemotherapeutic drugs in the
treatment of multiple human cancers, including lung, breast,
and ovarian. A signiﬁcant drawback to the use of these (and

other) systemic cytotoxics, however, is that they manifest a
variety of signiﬁcant and dose-limiting adverse side effects in
clinical practice. Synergistic combinatorial beneﬁt between
HSP90 inhibitors and taxanes has been described in different
cancer models (26–29), suggesting that their nonoverlapping
but complementary mechanisms of action are conserved
across tumor types. Indeed, the combination of ganetespib
with either paclitaxel or docetaxel promotes strong synergistic
activity and enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy in preclinical models
of NSCLC, TNBC, and ovarian cancer (23, 30, 31). The mechanistic beneﬁt afforded by the addition of ganetespib to the
taxane regimens was found to be multifactorial and included
loss of pro-survival signaling, direct impacts on the cell cycle
machinery, and exacerbation of mitotic catastrophe (23). Thus,
combined treatment with an efﬁcacious HSP90 inhibitor such
as ganetespib represents one potential strategy to improve
therapeutic indices without additional toxicity and, importantly, is likely to beneﬁt a higher percentage of patients with
cancer, not just those with client protein–driven disease.
Studies of ganetespib in KRAS-mutant NSCLC have uncovered intuitively attractive therapeutic combinations that effectively counteract oncogenic KRAS activity (32). Activating
KRAS mutations are one of the most prevalent oncogenic
drivers in NSCLC and are associated with unfavorable clinical
outcomes (33). However, KRAS has proven to be an intractable
therapeutic drug target, and KRAS-mutant NSCLC tumors
respond poorly to current therapies, highlighting an urgent
need for new treatment strategies. While KRAS itself is not a
client protein, many components of the downstream effector
pathways aberrantly stimulated by constitutive mutant KRAS
activity, including the canonical RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, are acutely sensitive to HSP90
inhibition. Moreover, recent studies have provided a compelling rationale for the combinatorial use of targeted MAP–ERK
kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
inhibitors in KRAS-driven lung tumors, with dual blockade of
the mitogenic and survival signaling arms providing superior
antitumor responses (34, 35). Because HSP90 inhibition conferred by ganetespib exposure can coordinately impact both
tumorigenic pathways, combinations of ganetespib with a dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor have been evaluated in KRAS-mutant
NSCLC (32). As predicted, concomitant and potent blockade of
the signaling cascades activated by KRAS mutation by this drug
combination resulted in superior cytotoxic activity in vitro and
signiﬁcant enhancement of antitumor efﬁcacy in a xenograft
model (32). At the molecular level, mTOR signaling represented
an important mechanistic point of convergence between the

Figure 1. Summary of the preclinical activity proﬁle of the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib. A, multiple oncogenic signaling molecules and pathways (green
arrows) are reliant on the chaperoning activity of HSP90, including receptor tyrosine kinases, canonic JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, MAPK and mTOR signaling,
constitutively active mutant kinases (stars) and their effectors, and transforming fusion proteins (e.g., EML4–ALK). Blockade of HSP90 by ganetespib
effectively and simultaneously destabilizes these cascades in tumor cells (red arrows). B, ganetespib overcomes multiple forms of acquired resistance.
Secondary activating mutations confer resistance to selective TKIs (e.g., erlotinib/geﬁtinib in mutant EGFR-driven tumors and crizotinib in
EML4-ALK–dependent NSCLC), yet ganetespib retains full potency against these phenotypes. In mutant BRAF-driven melanoma, resistance to vemurafenib
arises due to the reactivation of MEK/ERK signaling, which is abrogated by ganetespib exposure. In NSCLC, ligand-mediated activation of secondary
pathways (e.g., MET activation in mutant EGFR tumors and EGFR and/or HER signaling in EML4–ALK disease) can bypass tumor-cell dependency on
the original oncogenic drivers and contribute to resistance. The broad spectrum of biologic activity afforded by ganetespib treatment can counteract such
mechanisms.

two agents. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that HSP90 blockade alongside mTOR inhibition warrants further investigation
as a novel combinatorial approach for the treatment of KRASmutant lung cancer.
Mutational activation of BRAF, similarly resulting in dysregulation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis, is a feature of
more than half of all malignant cutaneous melanomas (36).
Unlike KRAS however, mutant BRAF has proved to be an
actionable target for molecular therapeutic approaches and
recently, vemurafenib, the ﬁrst selective small-molecule inhibitor of BRAFV600E, was approved as ﬁrst-line therapy for
patients with metastatic melanoma whose tumors harbor this
mutation. In addition, mutated BRAF is a highly sensitive
HSP90 client protein, and we have shown that single-agent
ganetespib is signiﬁcantly more potent than vemurafenib or
allosteric MEK inhibitors in BRAF-driven melanoma cell lines
(37). A number of combination trials are currently underway in
melanoma investigating the dual blockade of mutant BRAF
and MEK, with early experimental evidence suggesting that
this strategy may not only improve efﬁcacy compared with
single agents alone, but might also be an effective approach to
prevent or delay the onset of acquired resistance (38). In
preclinical models, strong synergistic activity was observed
when ganetespib was used as a cotreatment with either
vemurafenib or selective MEK inhibition, and the effects were
robustly recapitulated in xenograft tumors (37). These data
provide a novel framework for combining the modalities of
HSP90 inhibition with either selective BRAF or MEK targeting
as a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in melanoma cells that display oncogenic addiction to mutant BRAF.

Ganetespib Treatment Overcomes Diverse
Mechanisms of Drug Resistance
One of the most notable ﬁndings to emerge from the
characterization studies of ganetespib was its capacity to
overcome multiple forms of intrinsic and acquired resistance
to other clinically relevant targeted agents, including TKIs (Fig.
1B). For example, in NSCLC, activating mutations in EGFR
drive tumorigenesis and confer sensitivity to approved TKIs
such as erlotinib and geﬁtinib. The acquisition of a secondary
point mutation in the EGFR gatekeeper residue (T790M)
represents the predominant mechanism by which NSCLC
tumors develop acquired resistance to these drugs. Ganetespib
can overcome the resistant phenotype in NSCLC cell lines,
retaining full potency irrespective of EGFR mutational status
(6, 8). In addition, resistance to EGFR-directed TKIs may also
emerge through alternative oncogenic mechanisms. For example, hepatocyte growth factor, a ligand of the MET oncoprotein,
can induce TKI resistance in lung tumors with EGFR-activating
mutations by independently activating and restoring PI3K/
AKT signaling via phosphorylation of MET (39). Ganetespib
treatment was equally efﬁcacious in overcoming resistance
induced in cell lines by this mechanism (6). Perhaps more
importantly, ganetespib can also overcome acquired resistance
to crizotinib in ALKþ NSCLC, as evidenced by multiple experimental models and tumor responses in the clinical setting
(13). To date, a variety of speciﬁc ALK kinase domain mutations at different amino acid sites have been reported in

1298

Cancer Res; 74(5) March 1, 2014

patients who exhibit crizotinib resistance and a number of
others have been identiﬁed through mutagenesis screens (40).
It has been reported using a model of crizotinib-resistant
NSCLC dependent on an L1196M gatekeeper mutation within
the ALK domain that the cells were sensitive to HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG (41). Preclinical experiments have revealed
that ganetespib retains robust cytotoxic activity in mutated
ALK-expressing cell lines irrespective of the mutational site or
amino acid substitution present. Moreover, these ﬁndings were
validated by marked tumor shrinkage of lung lesions observed
in a patient with relapsed, crizotinib-resistant NSCLC upon
commencing ganetespib treatment (13). Taken together, these
data highlight the therapeutic potential of ganetespib within
the crizotinib-refractory population.
In mutant BRAF melanoma, a high percentage of patients
fail to initially respond to vemurafenib because of intrinsic
resistance to BRAF inhibition; furthermore, the clinical experience with this drug has shown that the long-term efﬁcacy of
treatment is hampered by the invariable development of
acquired resistance. A variety of mechanisms have been identiﬁed that contribute to the BRAF-inhibitor resistant phenotype that allow either bypass or reactivation of MAPK signaling
(38). Similar to what was found for another next-generation
HSP90 inhibitor, XL888 (42), ganetespib exposure can overcome both forms of resistance in in vitro and in vivo melanoma
models (37). Taken together, it seems then that the complexity
of resistance mechanisms to selective BRAF inhibitors may be
overcome by the simultaneous targeting of multiple signaling
pathways that is afforded by HSP90 blockade. In addition,
combination treatment of vemurafenib-resistant xenograft
tumors with ganetespib and the MEK inhibitor TAK-733
caused signiﬁcant tumor regressions (37), providing a further
compelling rationale for combining ganetespib with targeted
MEK agents as a new approach for treating tumors with
acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
One particularly interesting observation to arise from the
combinatorial studies performed in KRAS-mutant NSCLC was
drug-induced activation of compensatory feedback signaling
pathways in cell lines following exposure to either mTOR or
MEK inhibitors (32). Such a response commonly occurs due to
relief of negative feedback pathways required for cellular
homeostasis and, importantly, this mechanism has been proposed to contribute to adaptive resistance to targeted therapeutic agents (43). Ganetespib potently suppressed this
response in KRAS-mutant cell lines, further suggesting that
HSP90 inhibition may provide a more universal means to
overcome adaptive resistance in multiple oncologic settings.

Pathways to Achieving the Potential
Despite the enormous promise of HSP90 inhibitors as a class
of therapeutic agents, none are currently approved for any
cancer indication. The clinical development of the ﬁrst generation of compounds was hampered by weak potency, modest
clinical efﬁcacy, and signiﬁcant toxicities. To a large extent,
second-generation agents have overcome many of these limitations, based on their higher relative potency and improved
safety proﬁles. Key questions remain, however, including the
identiﬁcation of speciﬁc predictive biomarkers within cancer

types to stratify those individuals most likely to receive beneﬁt
from therapeutic HSP90 blockade. Moreover, continued exploration of biologically informed drug combinations is likely to
provide a direct path to the most efﬁcacious use of these agents
(1). Indeed, it is not unreasonable to envision the eventual
application of HSP90 inhibitors as adjuncts to systemic chemotherapies for a wide variety of human malignancies.
On the basis of the extensive preclinical characterization
and activity of the compound outlined here, it is perhaps not
surprising that ganetespib is one of the most clinically
advanced HSP90 inhibitors in development. The compound
is presently undergoing evaluation in 14 human trials, including two related phase IIb/III and phase III studies in advanced
NSCLC adenocarcinoma in combination with docetaxel
(NCT01348126 and NCT01798485). Conﬁrming preclinical predictions, the ganetespib þ docetaxel combination has shown

meaningful improvements in median overall survival compared with docetaxel treatment alone with no added toxicities
(44). As our knowledge of HSP90 biology continues to grow,
and appropriate patient populations likely to beneﬁt from
inhibitor-based therapies are identiﬁed, ganetespib is well
positioned to become an important player in the application
of new treatment strategies for the management of a variety of
human malignancies.
