ABSTRACT
Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a highly malignant cancer. BTC exhibits a low response
rate to cisplatin (CDDP) treatment, and therefore, an understanding of the mechanism
of CDDP resistance is urgently needed. Here, we show that BTC cells develop
CDDP resistance due, in part, to upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1).
Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound found in watercress, could
enhance the efficacy of CDDP by degrading Mcl-1. PEITC-CDDP co-treatment also
increased the rate of apoptosis of cancer stem-like side population (SP) cells and
inhibited xenograft tumor growth without obvious toxic effects. In vitro, PEITC
decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), which resulted in decreased GSH/oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) ratio and increased glutathionylation of Mcl-1, leading to rapid
proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. Furthermore, we identified Cys16 and Cys286
as Mcl-1 glutathionylation sites, and mutating them resulted in PEITC-mediated
degradation resistant Mcl-1 protein. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first
time that CDDP resistance is partially associated with Mcl-1 in BTC cells and we
identify a novel mechanism that PEITC can enhance CDDP-induced apoptosis via
glutathionylation-dependent degradation of Mcl-1. Hence, our results provide support
that dietary intake of watercress may help reverse CDDP resistance in BTC patients.

INTRODUCTION

chemoresistant. The mechanism of CDDP resistance in
BTC cells is poorly understood. Therefore, investigation
into the mechanism of CDDP resistance and strategies to
alleviate the CDDP resistance are urgently needed.
Various naturally occurring compounds are being
tested for their anti-tumor activity. Such compounds
when used in combination with known chemotherapeutic
agents may help in overcoming chemoresistance, and
may provide new strategies and ideas for treatment in
clinic. Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is present
in high concentrations as its precursor gluconasturtiin
in cruciferous vegetables, such as watercress. Upon
chewing or chopping, PEITC is released as a product of
hydrolysis mediated by myrosinase [5]. Accumulating
evidence indicates that PEITC can inhibit cell growth and

Biliary tract cancer (BTC) refers to a group of
cancers of the biliary tract, including gallbladder cancer,
cholangiocarcinoma of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile
ducts, and cancers of the ampulla and papilla of Vater
[1]. BTC is a common form of cancer in East Asia and
Latin America [2, 3] and surgical resection is the only
curative treatment. However, most patients are diagnosed
with advanced-stage disease, making them ineligible for
complete surgical resection. The prognosis for patients
with advanced BTC is very poor, and most survive
for less than a year after diagnosis. Cisplatin (CDDP)
based chemotherapy is widely used to treat patients
with advanced BTC [4]. However, BTC cells are highly

induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, suggesting
its potential value as an anticancer agent or an adjunctive
therapy to current cancer treatment strategies [6–8].
Additionally, it was shown that eating watercress can
significantly increase the blood level of PEITC in humans
[9]. These studies and their results gave us important clue
to study the effect of combined treatment with PEITC and
CDDP on BTC cells.
Though recent data has shown that PEITC can
sensitize some tumor cells to CDDP [5, 10–12], the
synergistic effect of PEITC and CDDP in BTC cells has not
been investigated. Here, we demonstrate for the first time
that CDDP resistance is partially associated with Mcl-1
in BTC cells, and PEITC can enhance CDDP-induced
apoptosis via glutathionylation-dependent degradation
of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Interestingly and
promisingly, PEITC-CDDP co-treatment can increase
the rate of apoptosis of cancer stem-like side population
(SP) cells and significantly reduce the growth of xenograft
tumor without any major toxic effects. Our results
suggests that dietary intake of watercress, which is a rich
source of PEITC, may help reverse CDDP resistance in
BTC patients.

A similar pro-apoptotic effect of the combined treatment
with PEITC and CDDP was also observed in human
cholangiocarcinoma RBE cells (Figure 1E–1H). Together,
these data demonstrated that PEITC can enhance CDDPinduced apoptosis in BTC cells.

PEITC enhances the sensitivity of SP cells and
xenograft tumors to CDDP
Recent studies have shown that SP cells isolated
from various cancer cell lines and primary tumors
possess cancer stem-like properties [13–16]. SP cells can
effectively avoid the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs,
and are considered to be the root cause of tumor recurrence
and metastasis. Therefore, we tested the effect of PEITCCDDP co-treatment on SP cells from GBC-SD cells. The
proportions of SP cells was 5.2% (Figure 2A). As shown in
Figure 2B, flow cytometry analysis of SP cells treated with
PEITC, CDDP, or a PEITC-CDDP combination showed
that CDDP alone caused little cell apoptosis, but when
combined with PEITC, markedly enhanced apoptosis at
24 hrs. These results demonstrate that PEITC significantly
enhances the sensitivity of SP cells to CDDP.
To further examine the synergistic effect of PEITC
and CDDP in vivo, GBC-SD cells were transplanted into
nude mice. When the tumor size reached approximately
50 mm3, mice were randomly sorted into four equal
groups. The tumor-bearing mice were intra-peritoneally
injected with physiological saline as a control, PEITC,
CDDP or PEITC-CDDP combination for 10 days.
Treatment of mice with CDDP alone moderately inhibited
tumor growth, but PEITC-CDDP combination treatment
resulted in a striking reduction in the average tumor
weight by about 50% (Figure 2C). The potent in vivo
anticancer effect in the PEITC-CDDP combined group
was further evident in the tumor growth curve data
(Figure 2D). Systemic toxic effects of the treatments in
these mice were evaluated by measuring the loss in body
weight. No notable differences were observed between
the treated groups (Figure 2E). Collectively, these
results demonstrate that PEITC-CDDP co-treatment can
effectively inhibit tumor growth without obvious toxic
effects in vivo.

RESULTS
PEITC enhances CDDP-induced inhibition of
cell viability in BTC cells by increasing apoptosis
To examine the effect of PEITC-CDDP co-treatment
on cell viability, human gallbladder cancer GBC-SD cells
were treated with PEITC, CDDP, or a PEITC-CDDP
combination, and cell metabolic activity was measured
using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Notably, PEITC-CDDP
co-treatment led to a significant reduction in cell viability
(Figure 1A). To quantify synergism, the median-drug
effect analysis method was used and the Combination
Index (CI) values were calculated. Synergism is
indicated by a CI of less than 1, additivity by a CI equal
to 1, and antagonism by a CI greater than 1. Normalised
isobolograms (Figure 1B) display data points below the
additivity line, indicating synergy in growth inhibition
of GBC-SD cells. Drug Reduction Index (DRI) was then
calculated (Table 1). These results suggest that PEITCCDDP co-treatment possesses a synergistic effect on
GBC-SD cell proliferation.
To determine whether PEITC in combination
with CDDP decreases cell viability via an increase in
apoptosis, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyarate (Annexin
V-FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double labeling flow
cytometry was used to determine the percentage of cells
entering apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that
CDDP caused about 10% of the cells to enter apoptosis,
but co-treatment with PEITC dramatically enhanced
CDDP-induced apoptosis to 40% (Figure 1C–1D).

Mcl-1 is partially responsible for CDDP
resistance in GBC-SD and SP cells
Anti-apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2
(Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl) and Mcl-1
are known to play key roles in cancer cell apoptosis.
Therefore, we investigated the relationship between these
anti-apoptotic proteins and CDDP resistance in GBC-SD
cells. Interestingly, CDDP treatment increased Mcl-1
protein level in a time- and dose-dependent manner,
but did not increase Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl protein amounts
(Figure 3A). To determine if Mcl-1 is playing a role in the

transfected with two siRNA oligonucleotides targeting
Mcl-1 (Figure 3B), followed by CDDP treatment for 24 hrs.
Knock down of Mcl-1 increased CDDP-induced apoptosis
(Figure 3C). We also observed that Mcl-1 protein level
was higher in SP cells than that in main population (MP)
cells (Figure 3D). These data suggest that Mcl-1 is partially
responsible for CDDP resistance in GBC-SD and SP cells.

expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4A–4B). Notably, combined treatment with
PEITC and CDDP significantly decreased Mcl-1 protein
level compared to CDDP alone (Figure 4C). In SP cells,
the PEITC-CDDP treatment also lead to a significant
decrease in Mcl-1 protein level compared to treatment
only with CDDP (Figure 4D). To investigate the effect of
PEITC-CDDP treatment on Mcl-1 protein level in vivo,
tumor tissues harvested from two mice of each group
were examined by immunoblotting. PEITC and/or CDDPmediated changes in Mcl-1 protein level in the tumor
tissue were generally in agreement with the molecular
alteration observed in cultured cells (Figure 4E).
Furthermore, exogenous overexpression of Mcl-1 impeded
PEITC-CDDP-induced apoptosis (Figure 4F–4G). These
data suggest that PEITC enhances the cytotoxicity of
CDDP through a reduction in Mcl-1 in vitro and in vivo.

To better understand the mechanism of how
PEITC overcomes CDDP resistance, we analyzed Mcl-1
protein level in lysates from GBC-SD cells treated with
PEITC and/or CDDP. PEITC treatment decreased Mcl-1

To determine if the decrease in Mcl-1 protein level
caused by PEITC was due to transcriptional inhibition or
post-transcriptional regulation, we examined Mcl-1 mRNA
level by quantitative real time PCR in GBC-SD cells
treated with PEITC. Surprisingly, PEITC increased
Mcl-1 mRNA level (Figure 4H). This suggested that

PEITC-mediated decrease of Mcl-1 expression is regulated
post-transcriptionally. Western blot analysis showed that
Mcl-1 degradation was facilitated after 6 hours of PEITC
treatment (Figure 4I). Next, to ask if PEITC mediated
degradation of Mcl-1 involves proteasomal degradation,
we treated GBC-SD cells with the proteasome inhibitor

MG132 and found that the treatment recovered Mcl-1
protein amount to normal level (Figure 4J). Taken
together, these data indicate that PEITC decreases Mcl-1
protein level via proteasomal degradation.

PEITC-induced GSH depletion (Figure 5G), a decrease
in GSH/GSSG ratio (Figure 5H), and Mcl-1 degradation
(Figure 5I). Also, it significantly suppressed PEITC-CDDPinduced cell apoptosis (Figure 5J). Taken together, these
data suggest that PEITC induces proteasomal degradation
of Mcl-1 through depletion of GSH and a decrease in GSH/
GSSG ratio.

PEITC induces proteasomal degradation of
Mcl-1 through depletion of reduced glutathione
(GSH) and decrease of GSH/oxidized glutathione
(GSSG) ratio

PEITC induces proteasomal degradation of
Mcl-1 by increasing the glutathionylated Mcl-1

Previous studies have shown that PEITC can alter
the redox state of cancer cells through GSH reduction
[6, 7, 17]. Since Mcl-1 is a redox sensitive protein [7],
we analyzed the relationship between GSH reduction and
Mcl-1 degradation in GBC-SD cells. Analysis of GSH
revealed that PEITC induced a rapid GSH depletion,
detectable after 1 hour of treatment (Figure 5A).
As shown in Figure 5B–5C, PEITC increased GSSG levels
and decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, which reflects the cellular
redox state, after 6 hours of treatment. In comparison, CDDP
only induced GSH and GSSG reduction with no apparent
reduction in GSH/GSSG ratio (Figure 5D–5F). Therefore,
these data suggest that PEITC can induce oxidative stress
in GBC-SD cells. Coincidently, PEITC also facilitated
Mcl-1 degradation after 6 hours of treatment (Figure 4B).
Since there was no Mcl-1 degradation in the first few hours
of PEITC incubation, it is likely that the depletion of GSH
was a primary event that triggered a decrease in GSH/
GSSG ratio and subsequent Mcl-1 degradation. In support
of this hypothesis, supplementing cell culture medium
with GSH precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented

Since Mcl-1 is a target of glutathionylation [7] and
protein glutathionylation is greatly enhanced by decreased
GSH/GSSG ratios that accompany cellular oxidative
stress [18], we speculated that PEITC could increase the
glutathionylated Mcl-1. Firstly, we found that endogenous
Mcl-1 was partially glutathionylated under non-stressed
conditions (Figure 6A). Furthermore, we found that
DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent, decreased
the glutathionylated Mcl-1, and PEITC increased the
glutathionylated Mcl-1 in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 6B–6C).
Previous studies have demonstrated that
glutathionylation of certain proteins may affect their functions
and stability [18, 19]. We speculated that the glutathionylated
Mcl-1 may be more susceptible to proteasomal degradation.
Since only two cysteine residues, Cys16 and Cys 286,
exist in the Mcl-1 protein, we investigated both these
sites for potential glutathionylation. We used site-directed
mutagenesis to convert these two cysteine residues Cys16
and Cys286, to serines (C16S, C286S, and C16S/C286S).

By examining the glutathionylation of Flag-Mcl-1 wild type
(WT) and mutants, we found that the C16S mutant was
weakly glutathionylated and the C286S mutant was modestly
glutathionylated (Figure 6D, lanes 3–4), whereas the double
mutant was devoid of any glutathionylation (Figure 6D,
lane 5). Taken together, these findings suggest that both
the two cysteine residues of Mcl-1 are glutathionylation

sites. Finally, cells expressing Flag-Mcl-1 WT and C16S/
C286S mutant were treated with PEITC for 24 hrs, and
their protein levels were determined. Flag-Mcl-1 WT
protein was decreased in PEITC-treated cells, while the
C16S/C286S mutant was not sensitive to PEITC-mediated
degradation (Figure 6E), suggesting that PEITC induces
glutathionylation-dependent degradation of Mcl-1.

DISCUSSION

platinum entry into the nucleus, an increase in drug export
and so on [11, 20–24]. In addition, cisplatin resistance
can develop through an increased ability to avoid druginduced cell damage, cell shrinkage and hence initiation
of apoptosis [25]. Apoptosis is regulated in part by the
Bcl-2 family of proteins which consists of both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins [26]. Among all the
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 functions as
a major survival factor, particularly in solid cancers [27].

CDDP-based chemotherapy is an important
treatment regimen used in the clinical management of
BTC, but the mechanisms for CDDP resistance are not
entirely clear. Cancer cells may become resistant to
platinum-based drugs through multiple mechanisms, such
as an increased ability to repair DNA damage caused by
platinum, neutralization of platinum toxicity, blocking

Despite the confirmed importance of Mcl-1 in several
cancers, the role of Mcl-1 in BTC survival has yet to be
explored. In this study, we provided evidence that the
effectiveness of CDDP is partially dependent on the Mcl-1
expression. Previously we found that Mcl-1 expression is
increased in gallbladder carcinoma tissues [28]. Therefore
investigation into new therapeutic strategies targeting
Mcl-1 could prove crucial in treating BTC.

Several studies have discovered that PEITC is able
to enhance the cytotoxic effect of CDDP in cancer cells
[10, 11]. But the synergistic effect of PEITC and CDDP in
BTC cells remains unknown. Moreover, little information
is available concerning the functional role of Mcl-1 in
mediating PEITC-induced chemosensitization. In this
study, we found that PEITC can significantly enhance
CDDP-induced apoptosis by degrading Mcl-1 in BTC

of PEITC and CDDP in BTC cells. CDDP can increase Mcl-1 protein level, which is partially responsible for CDDP resistance. PEITC
can deplete GSH, decrease GSH/GSSG ratio and increase the glutathionylated Mcl-1, making Mcl-1 more susceptible to proteasomal
degradation. Mcl1-SSG: the glutathionylated Mcl-1. IB: immunoblot.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

cells. Under mild oxidative stress, protein glutathionylation
regulates functions of multiple proteins [18, 19]. Here,
our results clearly show that Mcl-1 is glutathionylated in
GBC-SD cells and a sub-toxic concentration of PEITC
increases the glutathionylated Mcl-1, followed by rapid
proteasomal degradation. Whereas, Trachootham et al.
showed that PEITC renders Mcl-1 more susceptible to
cleavage by caspase-3 by de-glutathionylation of Mcl-1
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells [7]. We speculate
that the discrepancy is due to different cell lines and
different concentration of PEITC in two studies. PEITC
may have different effect on pathways existing in different
cells, and may impact degradation pathway of Mcl-1.
By mutagenesis, we identified and confirmed that both
Cys16 and Cys286 are glutathionylation sites on human
Mcl-1 protein. Although there was a consistent correlation
between glutathionylation levels and proteasomal
degradation of Mcl-1, the double mutant could not be
glutathionylated (Figure 6D) and only partially prevented
proteasomal degradation (Figure 6E). This suggests that
PEITC-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 may involve not
only glutathionylation-dependent degradation but also
other mechanisms. It would be interesting to examine other
mechanisms of PEITC-mediated degradation of Mcl-1.
Conventional chemotherapies for cancer cells are
believed to mainly eliminate the majority of differentiated
cancer cells but spare cancer stem cells, which are thought to
be associated with recurrence [29–31]. In the present study,
we used SP cells from GBC-SD cells as a model of cancer
stem-like cells and found that SP cells have higher Mcl-1
expression, consistent with a recent report [32]. Moreover,
PEITC enhanced the efficacy of CDDP by degrading
Mcl-1 in SP cells, which implies that PETIC is a promising
chemotherapy-sensitizing agent targeting cancer stem cells.
Previous studies showed that eating watercress can
significantly increase the blood level of PEITC in humans
[9] and an oral dose of 40 mg PEITC can result in a plasma
concentration in the micromolar range within 3 to 8 hrs
[33]. Thus, the effective concentration of PEITC appears
to be achievable by oral supplementation in humans.
Furthermore, a Phase I trial showed that at lower doses
(40 and 80 mg daily for 30 days) PEITC was well-tolerated,
and patients that consumed high doses of PEITC (120 and
160 mg daily for 30 days) showed only minor toxicity with
low-grade diarrhea [5]. The fact that PEITC is found in our
normal diets combined with its relatively low toxicity in
humans provides strong support for a clinical investigation
of PEITC-CDDP co-treatment in BTC.
In conclusion, CDDP resistance is partially
associated with Mcl-1 in BTC cells and PEITC can
enhance CDDP-induced apoptosis via glutathionylationdependent degradation of Mcl-1. These results not
only identify a novel mechanism of PEITC-enhanced
chemosensitivity of BTC cells to CDDP, but also provide
support that dietary intake of watercress may help reverse
CDDP resistance in BTC patients.

PEITC, NAC, Hoechst 33342, verapamil, DTT and
cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. MG132 was
purchased from Calbiochem and CDDP was obtained from
Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Jinan, China). PEITC was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and was freshly
diluted in culture media before use in experiments.

SP cell sorting from GBC-SD cells
SP analysis was performed as previously described
[34]. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in icecold Hank’s balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Hoechst
33342  was added at a final concentration of 5  mg/ml
in the presence or absence of 50 mg/ml verapami. After
incubating at 37°C for 90 min, the cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry.

Cell viability, apoptosis analysis, CI and DRI
Cell viability was assayed using the MTT assay
(Sigma) as previously described [35]. Cell apoptosis
was assessed using an Annexin V-FITC/ PI kit (BD
Pharmingen) and analyzed by flow cytometry on FACS
Calibur (Becton Dickson) [36]. Cells that were positively
stained by Annexin V-FITC only (early apoptosis) and
positive for both Annexin V-FITC and PI (late apoptosis)
were quantitated and both subpopulations were considered
as overall apoptotic cells. 
CI and DRI values of PEITC-CDDP co-treatment
were determined using the CalcuSyn software using nonconstant ratio combination design as previously described
[37, 38].

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time
PCR were carried out as previously described [39].
Primers sequences used in PCR analysis were as follows:
Mcl-1 forward 5ʹ-TCCAAGGCATGCTTCGGA-3ʹ and
reverse 5ʹ-GGCACCAAAAGAAATGAGAGTCAC-3ʹ;
GAPDH forward 5ʹ-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3ʹ
and reverse 5ʹ-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3ʹ.
Human GADPH mRNA served as an endogenous control
for normalization.

GSH/GSSG ratio assay

were measured twice a week using a calliper, and were
calculated using the formula V = π/6 × length × width2
[34, 45]. When the tumor size was approximately 50 mm3,
the mice were sorted into four equal groups (n = 7 mice
per group). The tumor-bearing mice were intra-peritoneally
administered with physiological saline as a control, PEITC
(25 mg/kg), CDDP (2.5 mg/kg) or PEITC/CDDP twice a
week. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week with
a calliper and body weights were also recorded. The mice
were sacrificed after 10 days, and body weight and tumor
weight were measured.

GSH is a tripeptide with a free thiol group and
function as a major antioxidant in cells. GSH/GSSG ratio
reflects the cellular redox state. The total GSH and GSSG
were determined by colorimetric microplate assay kit
(Beyotime, China) as previously described [40, 41]. GSH/
GSSG ratio was obtained {ratio = (Total GSH – 2GSSG)/
GSSG}.

Mcl-1 siRNA and mutant transfection
Two specific siRNA oligonucleotides complementary
to the Mcl-1 mRNA sequence were transiently transfected
into GBC-SD cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
as previously described [42, 43]. A non-specific siRNA was
also transfected as a mock control. After 48 hrs, GBC-SD
cells were either lysed for western blot analysis or were
exposed to CDDP for an additional 24 hrs and analysed for
apoptosis using the methods described above. The siRNA-1
sequences complimentary for Mc1–1  mRNA were 5ʹ
GUAUCACAGACGUUCUCGUdTdT 3ʹ and 3ʹ dTdTCAU
AGUGUCUGCAAGAGCA 5ʹ. The siRNA-2 sequences
complimentary for Mcl-1 mRNA were 5ʹ GGACUUUU
AGAUUUAGUGAdTdT 3ʹ and 3ʹ dTdTCCUGAAAAUC
UAAAUCACU 5ʹ.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mcl-1 gene was
performed using the Quick Change Lightning SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) using
the pcDNA3.1-Flag-Mcl-1 plasmid as the template.
Cells were transiently transfected with Flag-Mcl-1 WT
and mutants using the above-mentioned Lipofectamine
method. Nonrelevant plasmid pcDNA3.1 was used as
the transfection control. After 48 hrs, GBC-SD cells were
lysed for immunoprecipitation (IP) or treated with PEITC
for an additional 24 hrs and analysed by western blot. The
anti-Flag monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma.

Statistical analysis
Data were shown as mean value ± SD. SPSS17.0
software was used for statistical analysis. Analysis of
variance was applied for comparison of the means of two
or multiple groups. A value of P < 0.05 was considered
significant.
