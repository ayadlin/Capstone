Abstract
Expression and activity of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins
correlate with the metastatic capacity and aggressiveness of
tumors. Here, we show that transformation of murine
embryonic fibroblasts with v-H-ras or c-srcY527F changes the
distribution, density, and ultrastructure of the lysosomes,
decreases the levels of lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) in an extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)- and cathepsin-dependent manner,
and sensitizes the cells to lysosomal cell death pathways
induced by various anticancer drugs (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide,
doxorubicin, and siramesine). Importantly, K-ras and erbb2
elicit a similar ERK-mediated activation of cysteine cathepsins,
cathepsin-dependent down-regulation of LAMPs, and increased drug sensitivity in human colon and breast carcinoma
cells, respectively. Notably, reconstitution of LAMP levels by
ectopic expression or by cathepsin inhibitors protects transformed cells against the lysosomal cell death pathway.
Furthermore, knockdown of either lamp1 or lamp2 is sufficient
to sensitize the cells to siramesine-induced cell death and
photo-oxidation–induced lysosomal destabilization. Thus, the
transformation-associated ERK-mediated up-regulation of
cysteine cathepsin expression and activity leads to a decrease
in the levels of LAMPs, which in turn contributes to the
enhanced sensitivity of transformed cells to drugs that trigger
lysosomal membrane permeabilization. These data indicate
that aggressive cancers with high cysteine cathepsin levels are
especially sensitive to lysosomal cell death pathways and
encourage the further development of lysosome-targeting
compounds for cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6623–33]

Introduction
Lysosomes are highly dynamic cytosolic organelles that receive
membrane traffic input from the biosynthetic (trans-Golgi
network), endocytic, and autophagic pathways (1, 2). They contain
more than 50 hydrolases that can process all the major macro-

molecules of the cell to breakdown products available for
metabolic reuse (3, 4). Cathepsin proteases are among the beststudied lysosomal hydrolases. They are maximally active at the
acidic pH of lysosomes (pH 4–5). However, many of them can be
active at the neutral pH outside lysosomes, albeit with a decreased
efficacy and/or altered specificity (5). For example, transformation
and tumor environment enhance the expression of lysosomal
cysteine cathepsins and increase their secretion into the extracellular space (6). Once outside the tumor cells, cathepsins stimulate
angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasion in murine cancer
models, thereby enhancing cancer progression (7, 8). On the other
hand, the leakage of cathepsins into the cytosol can trigger either
necrotic or apoptotic cell death pathways (4, 9). Thus, the
maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity is of utmost
importance for the cell survival.
Cancer cells harbor several acquired changes that help them to
avoid spontaneous and therapy-induced apoptosis (10, 11). Thus,
the lysosomal cell death pathways characterized by an early
lysosomal membrane permeabilization and the subsequent
translocation of cathepsins into the cytosol have awoken
increasing interest among cancer researchers. Such lysosomal
cell death pathways can be induced by death receptors of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, p53 tumor suppressor
protein, oxidative stress, microtubule-stabilizing and microtubuledestabilizing agents, siramesine, etoposide, staurosporine, etc.
(12–19). Once in the cytosol, cathepsins, particularly cysteine
cathepsins B and L and aspartate cathepsin D, can initiate the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway possibly via a cleavage-mediated
activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (20). Importantly,
cytosolic cathepsins can also trigger caspase-independent and
Bcl-2–insensitive cell death pathways even in highly apoptosisresistant cancer cells (4, 21). For example, siramesine, a promising
anticancer drug presently under preclinical development, is a
lysosomotropic detergent that accumulates in lysosomes and
directly destabilizes them, leading to the translocation of
cathepsins into the cytosol- and cathepsin-dependent cell death
pathway even in the presence of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein
(17, 22). The signaling pathways leading to the lysosomal leakage
induced by most other lysosome-destabilizing agents are poorly
understood. Depending on the cell type, TNF-induced permeabilization of lysosomes and the following cell death can occur either
independent of caspases or via a pathway involving both caspase8 and caspase-9 (13, 18). Free radicals, sphingosine, iron,
phospholipases, and cathepsin B are among the suggested
caspase-independent mediators of the lysosomal destabilization
(4, 9, 23).

Cancer Research

Our recent data show that immortalization and oncogene-driven
transformation lead to increased sensitivity to the lysosomal cell
death pathways induced by TNF or siramesine (17, 24). The aim of
this study was to enlighten the molecular mechanism responsible
for the oncogene-mediated sensitization. For this purpose, we used
four cellular transformation models, that is, NIH3T3 murine
embryonic fibroblasts transformed either with (a) viral Harvey
ras (v-H-ras) or (b) oncogenic c-srcY527F compared with vectortransduced cells (24), (c) human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells
that harbor an activating mutation at codon 13 of K-ras compared
with HCT116-derived Hkh2 cells, in which activated K-ras has been
disrupted by homologous recombination (25), and (d) human
MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells expressing tetracycline-regulated
NH2-terminally truncated active form of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine
kinase (26). Prompted by our data showing that oncogenes
sensitized cells to treatments that trigger lysosomal leakage by
different mechanisms, we hypothesized that this sensitization was
due to changes in lysosomes themselves rather than in signaling
pathways that lead to the lysosomal permeabilization. Thus, we
studied the effects of transformation on lysosomal density,
composition, and ultrastructure and observed consistent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in cysteine
cathepsin expression and activity and cathepsin-dependent downregulation of lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP-1
and LAMP-2) in transformed cells. Studies using RNA interference–
mediated down-regulation and ectopic expression of lamp1
and/or lamp2 indicated that down-regulation of lamp1 and
lamp2 is essential, but not sufficient, to the transformationassociated sensitization to TNF and anticancer drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments. NIH3T3 fibroblasts, HCT116 colon
carcinoma cells, and HCT116-derived Hkh2 cells (25) were propagated in
DMEM with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FCS, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and
antibiotics. NIH3T3 cells were transduced with an empty pBabe-puro
retrovirus (provided by Christian Holmberg, University of Copenhagen,
Copenhagen, Denmark) or pBabe-puro encoding for v-H-ras (provided by N.
Dietrich, University of Copenhagen), c-srcY527F (provided by S. Courtneidge,
Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI), H-ras-V12 and its
dominantly active effector loop mutants 35S, 37G, and 40C (provided by
Channing Der, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; ref. 27), or
lamp-2 (Supplementary Data) as described previously (24). Cells were used
at passages 3 to 10 after transduction. U-2-OS osteosarcoma and MCF-7-tetDNErbB2 cells (26) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with GlutaMAX and 6%
heat-inactivated FCS. The medium for MCF-7-tet-DNErbB2 cells was further
supplemented with 0.3 Ag/mL tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich).
Siramesine {1¶-[4-[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H -indol-3-yl]-1-butyl]spiro[isobenzo furan-1(3H ),4¶-piperidine]} was kindly provided by Christian
Thomsen (Lundbeck A/S, Valby, Denmark); recombinant murine TNF was
purchased from R&D Systems; etoposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, concanamycin A (ConA), and cycloheximide were from Sigma-Aldrich;
zFA-fmk was from Enzyme System Products; Ca-074-Me was from Peptides
International; DEVD-cmk was from Bachem; U0126 was from Promega; and
PD98059 was from Calbiochem.
RNA interference. The cells were transfected with Oligofectamine or
RNAiMax (Invitrogen) and 6 to 25 nmol/L of small interfering RNA (siRNA)
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. siRNAs targeting ctsb encoding
for cathepsin B (5¶-UUGUCCAGAAGUUCCAAGCUUCAGC-3¶), lamp1
(lamp1#2, 5¶-GGACATACACTCACTCTCAATTTCA-3¶), and lamp2 variants
2a and 2b (lamp2#1, 5¶-TCAGGATAAGGTTGCTTCAGTTATT-3¶; lamp2#2,
5¶-GCAGCACCATTAAGTATCTAGACTT-3¶) were from Invitrogen; siRNA
targeting mapk1 encoding for ERK2 (5¶-UUAUCUGUUUCCAUGAGGUCC-3¶)

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

was from Ambion; and a control siRNA (5¶-AAGGGATACCTAGACGTTCTA3¶) was from Dharmacon Research.
Detection of cell viability and cell death. Cell density was assessed by
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT;
Sigma-Aldrich) reduction assay and cell death by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) release assay (Roche) essentially as described previously (13). For the
analysis of apoptosis-like cell death, cells were cotransfected with a plasmid
encoding for a fusion protein consisting of histone 2B and enhanced green
fluorescent protein (H2B-eGFP-N1; a gift from Christian Holmberg) and the
indicated plasmid at a ratio of 1:10 using FuGENE-HD (Roche) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The percentage of green transfected cells
with condensed nuclei was counted at an inverted fluorescence microscope
(IX70, Olympus).
Immunodetection and microscopy. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry of formaldehyde-fixed cells were performed as described
previously (24). Primary antibodies used included murine monoclonal
antibodies against h-tubulin (clone E7), human LAMP-1 (clone H4A3), and
human LAMP-2 (clone H4B4) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA),
H-Ras (clone 18) and human cathepsin L from BD Transduction
Laboratories, human cathepsin L (clone 33/1; ref. 1) and human cathepsin
B (clone AB-1) from Merck Chemicals, Src (clone EC10) from Millipore,
ErbB2 (Ab-17) from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Biogenesis; rat monoclonal
antibodies against lysosomal NH2 termini of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 from
the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; rabbit monospecific antibody
against phospho-p44/42 ERK (clone 197G2) from Cell Signaling Technology;
polyclonal rabbit antiserum against cytosolic COOH terminus of LAMP-2
(lgp96) from Zymed/Invitrogen; as well as polyclonal goat antisera against
ERK from Cell Signaling Technology and rat cathepsin B (3) and rat
cathepsin L (clone S-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Appropriate
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from DAKO A/S and Vector
Laboratories were used for immunoblotting and the detection was
accomplished using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting agents
(Amersham Biosciences). The Image Gauge software v4.21 was used to
quantify the protein levels. For immunocytochemistry, Alexa Fluor 576–
conjugated or Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibodies were used
and fluorescence images were taken using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser
scanning microscope.
Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously (28).
Enzymatic activity measurements. The total and cytoplasmic (digitonin extracted) cathepsin activities in NIH3T3 cells were measured in
digitonin-treated samples using zFR-AFC (Enzyme System Products) probe
as described previously (13, 24). The total cysteine cathepsin activities in
Hkh2 and HCT116 cells were measured following extraction by freezing and
thawing. N-acetyl-h-glucosamidase (NAG) activity was measured by
incubating 2.5 volumes of NAG substrate solution [0.3 mg/mL
4-methylumbelliferyl N -acetyl-h-D -glucosaminide (Sigma-Aldrich) in
0.2 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 4.5)] with 1 volume of sample for 40 min at
37jC. To stop the reaction, two sample volumes of 0.2 mol/L glycine (pH
10.5, adjusted with NaOH) were added and the end point of substrate
hydrolysis was analyzed (excitation, 455 nm; emission, 460 nm; and cutoff,
425 nm) using a SpectraMax Gemini flourometer (Molecular Devices).
The acid phosphatase activity was measured after incubation of 1 volume of
sample with 1 volume of 0.09 mol/L citrate buffer solution containing
2 mg/mL of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate (SigmaAldrich) for 20 min at 25jC. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes
of 0.5 mol/L NaOH and the substrate hydrolysis was analyzed at 405 nm
using a VersaMax tunable photospectrometer (Molecular Devices).
Subcellular fractionation. Equal amounts of cells were homogenized by
150 strokes in a DUALL glass homogenizer in a sucrose buffer [0.25 mol/L
sucrose, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4)] and
centrifuged at 3,000  g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the light
membrane fraction (LMF) and cytoplasmic and microsomal fractions was
subjected to a preestablished iodixanol gradient (24%-16%-10%-6%) and
centrifuged at 50,000  g for 17 h in an ultracentrifuge (rotor SW41Ti, 2331

Ultraspin 70, LKB Bromma). Fractions were carefully isolated from the
gradient in 500 AL volumes and their density was analyzed by measuring the
absorbance at 244 nm (Ultraspec 2000 spectrophotometer, Pharmacia
Biotech).
Analysis of mRNA. RNA was harvested and analyzed by reverse
transcription-PCR performed in the LightCycler 2.0 (Roche) with the
FastStart SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche) and appropriate primers (5¶CTTGCAAGGAGTGCGCTTGA-3¶ and 5¶-GCCTGGACCTGCACACTGAA-3¶
for lamp-1 and 5¶-CACCCACTCCAACTCCAACT-3¶ and 5¶-GAACTTCCCAGAGGGGCATC-3¶ for lamp-2) at 500 nmol/L and the lamp expression in
each sample was normalized to an external standard curve and evaluated
relative to the porphobilinogen deaminase (pbgd) expression as described
previously (29).
Cloning of lamp2. Murine lamp2 variant 2 (NM_010685) cDNA was
amplified by PCR from a cDNA library prepared from pBabe-puro–
transduced NIH3T3 cells with appropriate primers (5¶-CGAGGGGATTCGTTGGAATTG-3¶ and 5¶-AGTGTTACAGAGTCTGATATCC-3¶) and
subcloned into the EcoRI site in pBabe-puro.
Assays for lysosomal integrity. Subconfluent U-2-OS cells incubated
with 2 Ag/mL acridine orange for 15 min at 37jC were washed, irradiated,
and analyzed in HBSS complemented with 3% FCS. Cells for single-cell
imaging were selected from eight predefined areas of each well in
transmitted light mode, after which the same cells were immediately
visualized and exposed to blue light from USH102 100 W mercury arc
burner (Ushio Electric) installed in a U-ULS100HG housing (Olympus) for
20 s. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on Olympus IX70 inverted
microscope with a LCPlanF1 20 objective with numerical aperture of 0.40.
Loss of lysosomal pH gradient was quantified by counting the loss of
intense red staining.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of the results was
assessed using the unpaired or paired two-tailed t test in the case of two
samples and the repeated measures or one-way ANOVA with the Dunnett’s
multiple comparisons post test (compare all versus control) in the case of
more than two test samples.

Results
Transformation sensitizes cells to cathepsin-mediated cell
death. Immortalization of murine embryonic fibroblasts as well as
their subsequent transformation by v-H-ras and c-srcY527F oncogenes sensitize them to cathepsin-mediated cell death induced by
TNF and siramesine (17, 24). The same oncogenes have been
reported to both sensitize and induce resistance to other cytotoxic
agents (30–32). Thus, we tested the sensitivity of vectortransduced, v-H-ras –transduced, and c-src Y527F –transduced
NIH3T3 fibroblasts to cisplatin (alkylating agent that cross-links
DNA), doxorubicin (anthracycline that intercalates DNA), and
etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor). As shown in Fig. 1A, the
v-H-ras– and c-srcY527F –transduced cells exhibited significantly
enhanced sensitivity to all the drugs tested. Akin to the TNFinduced death of the immortalized and transformed NIH3T3
fibroblasts (24), the death induced by the anticancer drugs was
effectively inhibited by pharmacologic inhibitors of cysteine
cathepsins [Ca-074-Me and z-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone
(zFA-fmk)], whereas inhibitors of effector caspases (Asp-GluVal-Asp-chloromethylketone, DEVD-cmk, and DEVD-fmk) at
concentrations up to 50 Amol/L were without an effect (Fig. 1B;
data not shown).
These data suggest that these drugs induce a cathepsinmediated caspase-independent cell death pathway in immortalized
NIH3T3 cells that is further enhanced on transformation.
Accordingly, cisplatin triggered 1.8 and 2.7 times more lysosomal
leakage (measured as a percentage of cytosolic cathepsin activity of
the total cathepsin activity) in the v-H-ras– and c-srcY527F –
transformed cells when compared with vector-transduced cells,

www.aacrjournals.org

respectively (Fig. 1C). Due to higher total levels of cathepsin activity
in the transformed cells (see below), the actual cytosolic cysteine
cathepsin activity was, in fact, f4-fold higher in the cisplatintreated transformed cells compared with vector-transduced cells
(data not shown).
v-H-ras and c-srcY527F change the localization and density
of lysosomes. The ability of oncogenes to sensitize lysosomes to
agents that trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization by
different signaling pathways suggested that the effect was due to
their direct effect on lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, we
costained vector-transduced, v-H-ras–transduced, and c-srcY527F –
transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts with antibodies against LAMP-1
and Ras or Src. As reported earlier for oncogenic ras in breast
epithelial cells (33), both v-H-ras and c-srcY527F had a pronounced
effect on the distribution of the LAMP-1–positive vesicles in
NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). Whereas most LAMP-1–positive vesicles
localized to the perinuclear region of the control cells, in
transformed cells they were distributed throughout the cytosol,
including the tips of the elongated filopodia in v-H-ras–
transformed cells and invadopodia/podosomes in c-srcY527F –
transduced cells (Fig. 2A and B). Furthermore, H-Ras showed
partial colocalization with LAMP-1 (Fig. 2A). This colocalization
was biochemically verified by the analysis of LMFs obtained by
iodixanol sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2C). H-Ras and, to
a lesser extent, c-SrcY527F were enriched in the vesicle fractions
containing the majority of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and cathepsin B
proteins as well as cysteine cathepsin activity (Fig. 2C). This
analysis also revealed an oncogene-induced change in the density
of cathepsin- and LAMP-containing vesicles, whereas the density
of mitochondria, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum remained
unchanged (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S1). In control cells,
cysteine cathepsin activity peaked in fractions 12 and 13
(density, 1.065–1.069 g/mL), whereas in v-H-Ras– and c-SrcY527F–
transformed cells the activity was spread to fractions 10 to 15
(density, 1.049–1.07 g/mL) and 8 to 15 (density, 1.056–1.078 g/mL),
respectively. The ratio of active cathepsin B to procathepsin B
was increased in v-H-Ras– and c-SrcY527F–transformed cells (Fig. 2C).
2C). Transmission electron microscopy of the cells showed a
significant increase in large multilamellar bodies in both v-H-Ras–
and c-SrcY527F–transformed cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these
data indicate that transformation by either v-H-ras or c-srcY527F
changes the distribution, density, and ultrastructure of the
endolysosomal compartment.
Oncogenic transformation leads to cathepsin-dependent
decrease in LAMP levels. The highly homologous proteins LAMP1 and LAMP-2 contribute to f50% of all proteins of the lysosomal
membrane (34, 35). They consist of a polypeptide core of f40 kDa
that forms a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and
a large intraluminal domain with extensive N-glycosylation and
some O-glycosylation. The complex carbohydrate side chains
contribute to up to 65% of the total molecular mass of LAMP-1
and LAMP-2, forming a nearly continuous coat on the inner surface
of the lysosomal membrane. This carbohydrate coat has been
suggested to serve as a barrier against the hydrolytic activity of the
lysosomal enzymes. Interestingly, the analysis of vesicle fractions
from vector-transduced, v-H-ras–transduced, and c-srcY527F –
transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts suggested that the transformed
cells had reduced levels of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 proteins. To
ensure that this was not due to the fractionation procedure, we
analyzed their levels in total cell lysates. The data confirmed that
transformation by v-H-ras and c-srcY527F dramatically decreased

the levels of both LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts
(Fig. 3A). The reduction in LAMP-2 levels was observed by
antibodies recognizing both the highly glycosylated lysosomal and
the nonglycosylated cytosolic tails of the protein, indicating that
the reduced immunoreactivity was not due to the increased
glycosylation commonly observed in cancer cells (34). Notably,
the lamp1 and lamp2 mRNA levels were equal in vectorand oncogene-transduced NIH3T3 cells, indicating that the
transformation-associated regulation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2
expression occurred at the posttranscriptional level (Fig. 3B). We
have shown earlier that v-H-ras and c-srcY527F up-regulate the
expression and activity of cysteine cathepsins B and L in NIH3T3
fibroblasts (24). Thus, we tested whether elevated cysteine
cathepsin activity could be responsible for the enhanced turnover

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2. Indeed, the inhibition of cathepsins by
compounds that raise the lysosomal pH (ConA and bafilomycin A)
or by pharmaceutical cysteine cathepsin inhibitors [N-acetylleucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), Ca-074-Me, and zFA-fmk] increased the levels of LAMPs in v-H-ras–transduced NIH3T3
fibroblasts f2-fold (Fig. 3C; data not shown).
The role of Raf-1-ERK pathway in the Ras-induced lysosomal
changes. Raf-1-ERK, Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(RalGEF), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways contribute to the Ras-mediated transformation (27). To
investigate which pathway is responsible for the Ras-induced
lysosomal effects in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we took advantage of the
dominantly active H-ras-V12 effector loop mutants 35S, 37G, and
40C that preferentially activate Raf-1, RalGEF, and PI3K pathways,

respectively (27). Akin to v-H-ras, H-ras-V12 increased the level of
cysteine cathepsins and their activity, decreased the level of
LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, and sensitized the cells to the cytotoxicity
induced by cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and TNF (Fig. 4A–C).
Contrary to the cysteine cathepsin activity, v-H-ras and H-ras-V12
failed to affect the activity of two nonproteolytic lysosomal
hydrolases: NAG and acid phosphatase (Fig. 4B). As reported
previously (36), the 35S effector loop mutant that activates the
Raf-1-ERK pathway was sufficient to cause morphologic transformation comparable with that of v-H-ras and H-ras-V12, whereas
37G and 40C mutants had only a minimal transforming effect in
NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). In concordance with the reported
ability of the 35S mutant to induce cathepsin L expression in
NIH3T3 cells (36), it was also the only mutant that enhanced the
expression of cathepsin B and the total activity of cysteine
cathepsins as well as reduced the levels of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2
(Fig. 4A and B). The ability of pharmacologic inhibitors of the ERK
pathway (U0126 and PD98059) to increase LAMP-2 protein levels
and decrease cysteine cathepsin activity in v-H-ras–transformed
cells further supported the involvement of the Raf-1-ERK pathway
in Ras-mediated up-regulation of cathepsins and down-regulation
of LAMPs (Fig. 4A and B). Importantly, the H-ras-V12-35S mutant
sensitized NIH3T3 cells to the cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin,
etoposide, doxorubicin, and TNF as effectively as v-H-ras and
H-ras-V12 (Fig. 4C). Notably, 37G and 40C mutants protected the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

NIH3T3 cells against TNF-induced cell death, whereas they had no
effect on the cell death induced by the other agents. These data
together with the data showing that U0126 and PD98059
effectively inhibited cisplatin- and etoposide-induced cell death
in v-H-ras– and c-srcY527F –transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 4D;
data not shown) indicate that the Raf-1-ERK pathway is primarily
responsible for the oncogene-induced up-regulation of cysteine
cathepsins, down-regulation of LAMP-2, as well as the increased
sensitivity to the lysosomal cell death pathway in transformed
NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The related mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathways (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38) are not likely to
contribute to these lysosomal effects because their inhibitors
(SB600125 and SB203580) failed to increase LAMP levels in v-Hras–transformed cells (data not shown).
Down-regulation of LAMPs is necessary, but not sufficient,
to cell death sensitization. To test whether the transformationassociated decrease in LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 levels was sufficient for
the sensitization to the lysosomal cell death pathways, we
transduced the NIH3T3 cells with two nonoverlapping short hairpin
constructs targeting lamp1 and two nonoverlapping short hairpins
against the two splice variants of lamp2. All hairpins depleted the
targeted proteins effectively, but the depletion of LAMP-1 was
associated with an up-regulation of LAMP-2 and vice versa
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). None of the hairpins had any effect on

Cancer Research

To inhibit the compensatory up-regulation of the other lamp,
we created cells with hairpins targeting both lamp1 and lamp2.
In spite of a depletion of both proteins comparable with that in
oncogene-transformed cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S2B),
these cells displayed unchanged sensitivity to lysosome-targeting
cytotoxic compounds (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data
suggest that the down-regulation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 does
not alone explain the enhanced sensitivity of transformed cells to
the lysosomal cell death pathway. Therefore, we next tested
whether the down-regulation of LAMPs was necessary for this
phenomenon by transfecting the v-H-ras–transformed NIH3T3
fibroblasts with lamp2 and a plasmid encoding for a fusion protein
consisting of H2B and eGFP. In spite of a relatively small increase
in LAMP-2 expression, the transfected cells were significantly
protected against cisplatin-induced cell death compared with the
vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). It should be noted that the
ectopic expression of lamp2 was associated with an elevated level
of LAMP-1 in the transfected cells (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that
the down-regulation of LAMPs is necessary for the oncogeneinduced cell death–sensitive phenotype. The important role of
LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in lysosomal stability and cell survival in
transformed cells was further supported by the ability of siRNAs
against lamp1 or lamp2 to sensitize transformed cells (U-2-OS
osteosarcoma) to cell death induced by the lysosome-destabilizing
siramesine as well as to photo-oxidation–induced lysosomal
destabilization (Fig. 5B–D).
Oncogenes regulate LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 also in human
carcinoma cells. We next tested whether oncogenes also regulate
the levels of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in human epithelial cells. For this
purpose, we first compared human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells
that express activated K-ras oncogene with HCT116-derived Hkh2
cells, in which the activated K-ras has been disrupted by homologous recombination (25). Akin to the murine fibroblast model
system, K-ras sensitized HCT116 cells to cisplatin and siramesine
(Fig. 6A), and as reported earlier, it enhanced the expression and
activity of cysteine cathepsins (Fig. 6B; ref. 37). Furthermore, K-ras
reduced the protein levels of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 and resulted in
their slower migration in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B). This occurred in
a cysteine cathepsin–dependent manner as shown by the ability of
ConA and cysteine cathepsin inhibitors to significantly increase the
level of LAMP-2 and its motility in SDS-PAGE in K-Ras–expressing
HCT116 cells (Fig. 6B). Inhibition of ERKs by U0126 or PD98059
dramatically increased the expression of LAMP-2 and also slightly
decreased their motility in SDS-PAGE in HCT116 cells, suggesting
that the Raf-1-ERK signaling arm was also responsible for the
oncogene-mediated down-regulation of LAMP proteins and change
in their motility in this model system (Fig. 6B).
These results strongly suggest that the oncogene-mediated
down-regulation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 as well as the
sensitization to anticancer drugs are also relevant in human
cancer cells. This view was further supported by the sensitization to cisplatin-induced cell death, increase in cathepsin
expression, and reduction in the levels of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2
in MCF-7-tet-DNErbB2 breast carcinoma cells on induction of
the expression of NH2-terminally truncated active form of erbb2
oncogene (DNerbb2) by the removal of tetracycline (Fig. 6C and
D). Notably, DNerbb2 induces a constitutive activation of ERKs
in MCF-7 cells, and the inhibition of ERKs by U0126, PD98059,
or siRNA-mediated depletion of mapk1 that encodes for ERK2
increased the expression of LAMPs also in DNerbb2-expressing
cells (Fig. 6C and D). Furthermore, the DNerbb2-induced down-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

regulation of LAMP1 was effectively reverted by siRNA-mediated
depletion of ctsb, verifying the role of cysteine cathepsins in this
process (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The data presented above show that transforming oncogenes
induce a cysteine cathepsin–dependent reduction in LAMP
protein levels and a significant sensitization to the lysosomal
cell death pathways. Ectopic expression of lamp2 in v-H-ras–
transformed fibroblasts significantly reduced their sensitivity to
cisplatin without affecting the level of cysteine cathepsins,
indicating that the reduction in LAMP levels contributed to the
observed cell death–sensitive phenotype. Whereas the depletion
of lamp1 or lamp2 in human cancer cells destabilized their
lysosomes and sensitized them to lysosome-destabilizing siramesine, effective depletion of lamp1 and lamp2 had no effect on the
sensitivity of the nontransformed fibroblasts to the agents that
trigger lysosomal leakage. Thus, other transformation-associated
factors must act in concert with the reduced LAMP levels. The
ability of the dominantly active H-ras-V12 effector loop mutant
35S to sensitize the cells to cytotoxic agents as effectively as the
wild-type H-ras-V12 and the sensitizing effect of pharmacologic
inhibitors of the ERK pathway suggested that such factors are
activated preferentially by the Raf-1-ERK signaling pathway. Thus,
cysteine cathepsins, whose expression was also induced by H-rasV12-35S, seem as obvious candidates. It is, however, technically
impossible to test whether the increased cysteine cathepsin
activity in transformed cells cooperates directly with decreased
LAMP levels in destabilizing the lysosomes because experimental
modulation of cathepsin activity also changes LAMP-1 and
LAMP-2 levels.
Transformation-associated reduction in LAMP-1 and LAMP-2
levels seems to be mediated by cysteine cathepsin–mediated
increase in the turnover of these proteins. First, the steady-state
levels of lamp-1 and lamp-2 mRNAs were not affected by
transformation. Second, inactivation of cysteine cathepsins by
agents that increase the lysosomal pH, by pharmacologic inhibitors
of cysteine cathepsins, and by RNA interference increased the level
of LAMPs. Finally, both the increase in cysteine cathepsin
expression and activity as well as the reduction in LAMP levels
were mediated by the ERK signaling arm of H-ras-V12. It should be
noted that also other lysosomal proteases can control the half-life
of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2. For example, the deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition of cathepsin E, a lysosomal aspartic protease
predominantly expressed in cells of the immune system, induces
the accumulation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in murine macrophages
(39). Furthermore, cells defective in serine protease cathepsin A
show reduced rates of LAMP-2a degradation (39). Thus, the
cathepsin-mediated turnover of LAMPs and the subsequent
sensitization to the lysosomal cell death might be a more universal
phenomenon that is further enhanced on transformation. Interestingly, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) that effectively inhibits
lysosomal membrane permeabilization is found on the inner
membrane of lysosomes in some tumor cells (40). Thus,
translocation of Hsp70 into the lysosomal membranes may present
one of the mechanisms by which lysosomal membranes adapt to
increased ‘‘cathepsin stress.’’ Additionally, in the process of cancer
progression, tumor cells may up-regulate the transcription of lamp
mRNAs and thereby compensate for the deleterious effects of the
reduced half-life of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2. This hypothesis is

supported by studies showing increased levels of mRNAs for
lamp1 and lamp2 as well as for another lamp, lamp3, in various
human cancers (41, 42).
The transformation-associated changes in the lysosomal compartment were not limited to the increased cysteine cathepsin
expression and reduced LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 levels. Lysosomes
from transformed cells had a more dispersed localization within
the cell and a much wider distribution in the density gradient when
compared with lysosomes from vector-transduced control cells.
Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy revealed a dra-

matic increase in multilamellar bodies and a decrease in the
number of lysosomes with normal appearance. Interestingly,
similar changes have been observed in the lysosomal compartment
of v-H-ras–transformed melanocytes (43) as well as on upregulation of cathepsin L expression (44). It remains to be studied
whether the reduction in LAMP levels causes these changes in
transformed cells. This idea is supported by the data showing that
lysosomes from primary cells of lamp1 and lamp2 double-deficient
mice are larger and more peripherally distributed and display
multilamellar ultrastructure along with altered density (45).

Taken together, our data introduce cathepsin-mediated downregulation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 as a mechanism by which
various oncogenes sensitize cells to cytotoxic agents that trigger
lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Although the increase in
cysteine cathepsin activity has been well documented in
metastatic tumors (6, 7), it remains to be shown whether
LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 levels are concomitantly down-regulated in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

tumor tissue. Our data showing a K-Ras–mediated and cysteine
cathepsin–mediated LAMP reduction in human colon carcinoma
cells and ErbB2-mediated down-regulation of LAMPs in breast
cancer cells suggest that this is the case at least in some
tumors. These results strongly encourage the development of
lysosome-targeting drugs for the treatment of highly metastatic
cancers.
