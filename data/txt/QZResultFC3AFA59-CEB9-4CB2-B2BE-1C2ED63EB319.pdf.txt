Abstract
LL202, a newly-synthesized flavonoid derivative, has been reported to inhibit
inflammatory-induced angiogenesis. However, the exact role of LL202 in inflammation
along with its mechanism has not been explored. In this study, we investigated
the anti-inflammatory effect of LL202 on intestinal inflammation by establishing
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. LL202 attenuated DSSinduced body weight loss, colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage.
The inflammatory cells infiltration, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) activities were decreased by LL202 in a dose-dependent
manner. LL202 reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum
and colon of DSS-induced mice as well. Mechanically, LL202 could decrease the
expression and nuclear translation of AP-1 to protect against DSS-induced colitis.
In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced THP-1 cells, LL202 markedly decreased the
secretion, mRNA level and protein expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α via inhibiting
ERK/JNK/p38 MAPK pathways and the nuclear translocation of AP-1. Furthermore,
these findings were confirmed in LPS-induced bone marrow derived macrophages
(BMDM). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that LL202 could exert its antiinflammatory effect via inhibiting MAPK/AP-1 signaling, which suggested that LL202
might be a potential effective drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.

Introduction

warranted to discover effective anti-inflammatory agents
which can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production
and ameliorate UC.
The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription
factor has represented a paradigm for gene regulation
implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases [4, 5].
AP-1 consists of a variety of hetero- or homo-dimeric
complex and the dimers of Jun and Fos are translocated
to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of downstream
target genes [6, 7]. Mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK) are composed of three well-characterized
subfamilies, including extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERK1/2), Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38,
which are responsible for the expression and activation
of AP-1 [8, 9]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is thought to

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a kind of intractable
complex inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which
is characterized by idiopathic, chronic, relapsing and
inflammatory conditions in the gastrointestinal tract
[1, 2]. In recent years, the morbidity of UC increases
constantly in population and 396 per hundred thousand
American individuals suffer from IBD [3]. Although
the precise etiology of the disease is enigmatic and
unknown, increasing experimental and clinical evidences
suggest that a sustained and inappropriate activation
of the mucosal immune system with consecutive proinflammatory cytokine production plays a crucial role in
the development of IBD. Therefore, extensive research is

be the major pathogenic factor involved in inflammation
[10]. The previous studies have reported that LPS
enhanced the expression and nuclear transcription of
AP-1 [11, 12]. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines
are also act as important target genes of c-Jun and c-Fos
[13, 14], among which IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α play an
indispensable role in the development of ulcerative colitis
[1]. The pro-inflammatory pathogenic role of AP-1 implies
that inhibition of MAPK/AP-1 signaling is a promising
strategy for IBD therapy.
Various kinds of flavonoids have been reported to
exert anti-inflammatory properties, including wogonin,
baicalein, quercetin and so on[15–17]. LL202 is a newlysynthesized flavonoid, which bears the three-ring structure
of the flavone backbone and possesses a strong ability to
inhibit LPS-induced angiogenesis [18]. However, whether
LL202 could affect LPS-induced pro-inflammatory
cytokines production and inflammatory diseases such as
colitis, along with the molecular mechanisms, remain
unknown and warrant further investigations.
In our study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory
effect of LL202 on intestinal inflammation and the
potential mechanisms. We established the DSS-induced
experimental colitis to evaluate the protective effect
of LL202 on inflammation in vivo. Further mechanism
researches revealed that LL202 protected against DSSinduced colitis by inhibiting the expression and nuclear
translocation of AP-1 in colons. In addition, these findings
were confirmed in LPS-induced THP-1 cells and bone
marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro. Taken
together, these results suggested that LL202 prevented
DSS-induced colitis through a potential mechanism
attributed to inhibiting MAPK/AP-1 signaling and LL202
may serve as a candidate in the treatment of colitis.

We next performed histopathological analysis using
Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 2A) to
verify the protective effect of LL202 on colitis. The
mucosal damage was observed apparently in DSS-treated
mice, which is characterized by ulceration accompany
massive granulocytes and mononuclear cells infiltration
into the mucosa as well as congestion and edema of
the submucosa. However, LL202 (30 mg/kg) maintain
intact colonic architecture with no obvious ulcer and
inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, LL202
suppressed DSS-induced myeloperoxidase (MPO) and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities notably
(Figure 2B and 2C). CD11b is expressed on the surface
of various kinds of leukocytes [20], which can be used as
an indicator to monitor the occurrence of inflammation.
As shown in Figure 2D, a great number of CD11b+
inflammatory cells accumulated at the mucosa of the
lesion site in colonic tissues from DSS-treated mice were
presented obviously. LL202 (30 mg/kg) could reduce the
number of infiltrating CD11b+ inflammatory cells in colon
tissues. Taken together, these results indicated that LL202
could ameliorate DSS-induced colitis.

LL202 inhibited the infiltration of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in DSS-induced
colitis mice
Increased secretion and its infiltration of proinflammatory cytokines play a key role in the development
of DSS-induced colitis [21, 22]. Therefore, we assessed
the level of several main inflammatory cytokines to gain
an insight into the effect of LL202 on the inflammatory
status of DSS-induced colitis. As shown in Figure 3A–3C,
the secretory level of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in colonic
homogenates was significantly increased after DSS
challenge, while LL202 inhibited the elevated secretion
of these cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. We then
measured the level of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum.
The DSS-induced high content of these pro-inflammatory
cytokines in serum was remarkably suppressed by LL202
(Figure 3D–3F). In addition, LL202 at 30 mg/kg markedly
reduced the infiltration of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α-positive
inflammatory cells in colonic mucosa of DSS-induced
mice (Figure 3G).

Results
LL202 ameliorated colon injury and
inflammatory symptoms in DSS-induced colitis
in mice
To investigate the effects of LL202 on colitis
development, we established the DSS-induces model
in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 1A), which is a wellestablished preclinical model that exhibits many
phenotypic features related to human ulcerative colitis
[19]. An obvious character of DSS-induced colitis is
the significant loss of body weight, so body weights of
mice were monitored throughout the study. The results
showed that animals lost weight after DSS treatment,
but LL202 increased the body weight of DSS-treated
colitis mice significantly (Figure 1B). It has been
reported that DSS-induced colon shortening is a crucial
marker of colitis. As shown in Figure 1C and 1D, the
colon was obviously longer in LL202-treated mice than
in DSS-treated mice.

LL202 suppressed DSS-induced AP-1 signaling
in vivo
As AP-1 and NF-κB are two important
transcriptional regulators of these pro-inflammatory
cytokines [23, 24], we sought to determine whether
LL202 could inhibit AP-1 or NF-κB signaling. As shown
in Figure  4A, LL202 remarkably down-regulated the
expression of c-Jun and c-Fos in the colon tissues of DSSinduced colitis mice. In addition, compared to the control
group, LL202 decreased the expression level of c-Jun

and c-Fos in both cytosolic and cell nucleus (Figure 4C).
However, LL202 showed little effect on the increased
expression of p-IKK, p-IκB and p-p65. These results
suggested that LL202 could inhibit the expression and
nuclear translocation of c-Jun and c-Fos without affecting
NF-κB signaling in DSS-induced colitis mice.

our conclusion that LL202 inhibited the secretion of IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α in vivo, we investigated the effect of
LL202 on LPS-induced THP-1 cells. As expected, the
result showed that the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
induced by LPS was reduced by LL202 in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 5A–5C). Furthermore, we found
that the mRNA (Figure 5D–5F) and protein (Figure 5G–5I)
level of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were also increased in LPSstimulated THP-1 cells, while the increased expression was
reversed by LL202 treatment. Taken together, all of these
findings demonstrated that LL202 inhibited the expression
and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α.

LL202 inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines
production in vitro
It was reported that IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α play key
roles in inflammation-related diseases [25, 26]. To confirm

LL202 inhibited the MAPK/AP-1 signaling
in vitro

the nuclear translocation and the interaction of c-Jun and
c-Fos were decreased by LL202 (0.8 μM). The previous
study has shown that MAPK are responsible for the
expression, activation and nuclear translocation of Jun
and Fos proteins [27]. We then determined whether LL202
exerted the inhibition effect to the activation of ERK/JNK/
p38 MAPK pathways. Our results showed that LL202
markedly suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of
JNK, ERK1/2 and p38 (Figure 6B). In addition, EMSA
analysis further demonstrated that LL202 decreased the
DNA binding activity of AP-1 in THP-1 cells (Figure 6E).

To elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism
of LL202 in vitro, we examined the effect of LL202 on
the expression of AP-1 in LPS-induced THP-1 cells. As
expected, LL202 down-regulated the protein level of
c-Jun and c-Fos noticeably in THP-1 cells stimulated by
LPS (Figure 6A). Meanwhile, we observed that c-Jun or
c-Fos in cytosolic and cell nucleus were both decreased by
western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence showed that

of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in THP-1 cells stimulated by
exogenous IL-6 or TNF-α in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 7D and 7F). In further detection of
inactivation of the related-signaling, we found that
LL202 could inhibit the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB
signaling induced by IL-6 or TNF-α, while had no effect
on the activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)signaling in
IL-6 stimulated THP-1cells (Figure 7E and 7G). Taken
together, LL202 could inhibit AP-1 and NF-κB without
affecting IL-6/STAT3 signaling in vitro.

LL202 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines
production in IL-6 or TNF-α stimulated THP-1
cells
To further demonstrate the anti-inflammation effect
of LL202, we tested the secretion and expression of IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α in THP-1 cells stimulated by adding
IL-6 or TNF-α, respectively. THP-1 cells were rinsed
with PBS to remove the exogenous pro-inflammatory
cytokines after stimulation with IL-6 (100 ng/ml) or
TNF-α (100 ng/ml) alone for 12 h, and then treated with
indicated concentrations of LL202 for another 6 h. ELISA
showed that the concentration of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
was decreased dramatically in the supernatant of THP-1
cells stimulated by IL-6 or TNF-α (Figure 7A–7C).
Consistently, LL202 could also reduce the expression

expression level and nuclear translocation of c-Jun and
c-Fos were both reduced by LL202 in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 8G and 8H). These findings
above indicated that LL202 might exert an antiinflammatory effect via inhibiting AP-1 in BMDMs.

ulcerative colitis, has been widely used in lots of studies
related to human inflammatory bowel disease [34]. Here,
we performed this model to evaluate the protective effect
of LL202 against colitis. LL202 attenuated the serious
intestinal injury and inflammatory symptoms in DSSinduced colitis mice, including body weight loss, colon
length shortening and colonic tissue damage. The activity
of MPO is a marker of neutrophil infiltration [35] and iNOS
can destroy the mucosa and submucosa of the intestine by
regulating NO release [36], both of which can be considered
as index of inflammation damage. In DSS-induced colitis
mice, LL202 decreased MPO and iNOS activities, which
suggested that LL202 could reverse the infiltration of
inflammatory cells into colon tissues (Figure 2B–2D).
The high level of pro-inflammatory cytokine
secretion and expression is a hallmark of DSS-induced
colitis [21, 37]. It has been reported that the overabundance
of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α plays incomparable role in
promoting inflammation development [38–40]. LL202
inhibited the high-production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
dramatically both in the colon and serum of DSS-induced
colitis mice. In addition, the similar inhibitory effects of

Discussion
Ulcerative colitis, a prevalent inflammatory bowel
disease in the developed countries, is becoming more and
more common in developing countries these days [28, 29].
Recently, there are various emerging therapeutic drugs for
UC, such as sulfasalazine, azathioprine, corticosteroids,
classical immunosuppressants and TNF-α antibody
[30, 31]. However, most of these drugs have limitations
in efficacy and wide clinical applications for their serious
side effects [32, 33]. Hence, novel effective therapeutic
agents with fewer side effects and wider application are
urgent to be developed.
The model of DSS-induced colitis in mice, which
shows the similar pathological features with human

LL202 on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
were also observed in THP-1 cells and BMDMs in vitro.
Thus, LL202 could protect against DSS-induced colitis by
inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

LPS is commonly used as a potent inflammatory
stimulus, recognized by its sensor, toll-like receptors 4
(TLR4), and then initiate the downstream singling to
trigger the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [41].

MAPK, is one of the downstream pathways, which leads
to the induction of two main transcription factors AP-1
and NF-κB. They both control the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
[42]. The previous study showed that LL202 can modulate
LPS-induced angiogenesis by decreasing the expression
of TLR4 and inhibiting the activation of MAPK and
NF-κB pathways [18]. Therefore, we hypothesized that
the inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB nuclear translocation
may account for the underlying molecular mechanism of
LL202 that inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory

cytokines. As a result, we found that LL202 could inhibit
the expression and nuclear translocation of AP-1 without
affecting NF-κB signaling in DSS-induced colitis mice.
These results were further confirmed in LPS-induced
THP-1 cells and BMDMs in vitro, and the nuclear
translocation and binding with DNA of AP-1 were also
inhibited by LL202 in LPS-induced THP-1cells (Figure
6D and 6E).
To further demonstrate the inhibitory effect of LL202
on AP-1, THP-1 cells we treated with IL-6 and TNF-α,
another two pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. IL-6

binds to the IL-6 receptor complex, activates JAK/STAT3
signaling and then phosphorylated-STAT3 (p-STAT3)
translocates into the nucleus to promote the transcription
of its target genes [43]. However, LL202 could inhibit
the increased expression of c-Jun, c-Fos induced by IL-6
without affecting the activation of STAT3. It indicated
that LL202 could not be a broad-spectrum inhibitor of
phosphorylation. As NF-κB could be simultaneously
activated by TNF-α [44], we detected the effect of LL202
on NF-κB signaling in TNF-α stimulated THP-1 cells.
Phosphorylation of IKK, IκB and p65 were inhibited by
LL202 in a concentration-dependent manner. These results
of mechanism research were supported by the previous
study that LL202 inhibited the activation of MAPK and
NF-κB pathways in LPS-induced HUVECs and that
TLR4 signaling might serve as the upstream target [18].
However, it was strange that LL202 could not inhibit NFκB signaling in DSS-induced colitis mice, but blocked NFκB pathway activated by TNF-α in vitro. Yet the activation
of AP-1 both in vivo and in vitro was suppressed by LL202
apparently. It might be on account of the difference of
LL202 between in vivo and in vitro. These specific effects
of LL202 will be studied in the future research.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that LL202 could
protect against DSS-induced colitis in mice by inhibiting
MAPK/AP-1 signaling for the first time. These findings
provided the evidence that LL202 could be developed as
a therapeutic agent for colitis and have advantages for
potential clinical applications in the future.

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pieces of colonic
tissue were used for ex vivo analysis. The histological
analysis was performed as previously described [46].

and averaged and converted from log-linear to linear
terms. The primers in the reaction were used as follows:
Human IL-1β (forward, 5′-AGGCTGCTCTGG
GATTC-3′, reverse, 5′-GCCACAACAACTGACGC-3′),
Human IL-6 (forward, 5′-TGTAGTGAGGAACA
AGCCAGAG-3′, reverse, 5′-TACATTTGCCGAAAGAG
CC-3′),
Human TNF-α (forward, 5′-CTTCTCCTTCCT
GATCGTGG-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTGGTTATCTCTCAG
CTCCA-3′),
Human β-actin (forward, 5′-CTGTCCCTGTATG
CCTCT-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′).

Assessment of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity
Neutrophil infiltration into inflamed colonic mucosa
was quantified by MPO activity assessment using the
O-dianisidine method. Proteins extracted from colonic
tissues were used to assess MPO levels according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Measurement of iNOS activity

Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts and
whole cell lysates

The supernatant of colonic tissue was measured
by Nitric Oxide Synthase Assay Kit according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts were prepared
according to the instructions of the kit (KeyGEN, Nanjing,
China). One part of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was
subjected to immunoblot analysis. The rest of the nuclear
extract was used for electrophoretic mobility-shift assay
(EMSA).
The whole cell lysates was isolated by Pierce
RIPA buffer added with protease inhibitors (1 mM
Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol,
0.1 Mm NaF, 0.1 mM Leupeptin), incubated on ice for
50 min to allow cells to swell and then centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were saved
as the whole cell lysates and measured using the BCA
protein assay method with Varioskan spectrofluorometer
and spectrophotometer (Thermo) at 562 nm.

Immunofluorescence of CD11b in colon tissues
CD11b positive inflammatory cell infiltration
analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded colon
tissue sections. Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and washed in 1% PBS Tween. Then they
were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, blocked with
3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated for 1 h
at room temperature with anti-CD11b FITC (1:100). The
slides were then counter-stained with DAPI for 30 min.
The reaction was stopped by thorough washing in water
for 5 min. Images were acquired by confocal laserscanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, JP).

Cytokine quantification by enzyme-linked
immunoassay (ELISA)

Western blot analysis
Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 1% BSA at 37°C for 1 h
and incubated with indicated antibodies overnight at 4°C,
followed by IRDye800 conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h at 37°C. Immunoreactive protein was detected with
an Odyssey Scanning System (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln,
Nebraska).

Colons from mice in each group were homogenated
with lysis buffer to extract total protein. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The
amount of total extracted protein was determined by BCA
TM protein assay kit (Thermo, MA, USA). The amounts
of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the colon homogenate
were measured by ELISA kit. IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
production in supernatant of THP-1 cells, BMDMs and
serum of mice were measured by ELISA kits according to
the manufacturers’ recommendations.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
THP-1 cells were pretreated with LPS (1 μg/ml)
and LL202 (0.8 μM) for 6 h and then harvested.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked
with 3% BSA for 1  h. Samples were incubated with
primary antibodies against c-Jun (diluted 1:100)and
c-Fos (diluted 1:50) overnight at 4°C. After washed, cells
were exposed to FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:1000, Invitrogen, CA, USA). Samples were observed
and captured with a confocal laser scanning microscope
(Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated with Tripure Isolation
Reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The realtime PCR (RT-PCR) kit was purchased from TaKaRa
Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Dalian, China). Reactions were
conducted according to the instructions. Samples were run
on the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system. Each reaction
was done in triplicate, and the threshold values (Cs) for
each mRNA were subtracted from that of β-actin mRNA

References

Nuclear extracts were isolated as described above.
EMSA was then performed with a non-radioactive (biotin
label) gel shift assay according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide probes
(5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ and 3′-GCG
AACTACTGAGTCGGCCTT-5′) were end labeled with
biotin using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The
oligonucleotides were annealed to their complementary
oligonucleotides and incubated with nucleoproteins for 30
min at 25°C. Samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide
gel, which was transferred into Nylon member and
then blocked and washed. Bands were detected by
chemiluminescent method as previously described [46].
