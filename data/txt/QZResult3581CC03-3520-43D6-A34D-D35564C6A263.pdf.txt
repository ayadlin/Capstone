Treatment of Kidney Cancer
Insights Provided by the VHL Tumor-Suppressor Protein*
William G. Kaelin, Jr, MD

Germline inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is associated with an increased risk of clear cell
carcinoma of the kidney in the context of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Somatic VHL mutations are
also common in nonhereditary (sporadic) clear cell carcinomas. The VHL protein (pVHL) has multiple functions that might be linked to tumor suppression, including targeting the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. HIF, especially HIF2a, appears to play
a causal role in clear cell renal carcinogenesis based on genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease,
laboratory experiments with human VHL/ renal carcinoma cell lines, and genetically engineered mouse
models. Deregulation of HIF almost certainly accounts for the high levels of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) observed in kidney cancer and relates to their sensitivity to VEGF inhibitors. In addition, the
beneficial effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are likely due to, at least partly,
their ability to down-regulate HIF. pVHL, in a HIF-independent manner, also regulates a specialized structure called the primary cilium and regulates apoptosis via factors such as NFjB. Loss of the primary cilium
probably facilitates the development of preneoplastic renal cysts, whereas increased NFjB might contribute to the resistance of kidney cancers to conventional cytotoxic agents. Cancer 2009;115(10 suppl):2262–

Last year more than 12,000 people died of kidney cancer in the United States.1 Clear cell carcinoma is
the most common histologic form of kidney cancer and accounts for most kidney cancer deaths. Individuals who bear a defective VHL tumor suppressor gene allele in their germline (von Hippel-Lindau [VHL]
disease) are at increased risk for clear cell carcinoma of the kidney and other tumors, including vascular
tumors (hemangioblastomas) of the retina, cerebellum, and spinal cord and adrenal gland tumors (pheochromocytomas).2 The development of disease in this setting is linked to spontaneous inactivation or loss
of the remaining wild-type VHL allele. Biallellic VHL inactivation due to somatic mutations can also be
documented in approximately 50% of sporadic clear cell carcinomas.3 Some clear cell carcinomas that
retain a wild-type VHL allele fail to produce the VHL protein (pVHL) because the VHL gene is

hypermethylated. In short, loss of pVHL function is a common event in clear cell renal carcinoma. pVHL has many
biochemical functions, many of which are likely to contribute to its role as a tumor suppressor.4 Of these functions,
regulation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) appears to
play a particularly important role with respect to clear cell
carcinoma, although other functions, some of which are
outlined herein, are suspected of affecting the development
or behavior of clear cell carcinomas as well.
pVHL and HIF
pVHL is a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that
serves as an adapter to bring substrates into proximity with
a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. The best documented
pVHL substrates are the a-subunits of the heterodimeric
transcription factor called HIF, although other substrates,
including atypical protein kinase C, have been reported.4
There are 3 HIF-a subunits in humans (HIF-1a, HIF-2a,
and HIF-3a). When oxygen is available, HIF-a becomes
hydroxylated on 1 (or both) of 2 prolyl residues by members of the prolyl hydroxylase domain (also called EglN)
family, which then generates a pVHL-binding site.5 In
addition to oxygen, these enzymes respond to several other
cofactors, including 2-oxoglutarate, vitamin C, and iron.
Recruitment of the pVHL complex to HIF-a leads to the
polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of HIF-a.
When oxygen levels are low, or pVHL is inactivated, HIFa can accumulate, dimerize with its partner HIF-b (for
example, HIF-1b; also called ARNT1), bind to hypoxia
response elements, and activate transcription of approximately 100 to 200 genes. Many of these genes promote
adaptation to acute or chronic hypoxia.
HIF and Renal Carcinoma
Several lines of evidence suggest that HIF-a, especially
HIF-2a, plays a causal role in clear cell carcinoma. Restoration of pVHL function in VHL/ clear cell carcinoma
cells is sufficient to suppress their ability to form tumors
in nude mice in vivo and promotes cell-cycle exit and differentiation in vitro (under specific culture conditions).6-9
This activity is tightly correlated with the ability of pVHL
to down-regulate HIF-a. In particular, some VHL families have a low risk of developing kidney cancer, and some
families are at high risk for this disease. When tested, VHL
alleles linked to low-risk families encode proteins that are

normal, or nearly normal, with respect to HIF-a regulation.10-12 In contrast, VHL alleles linked to a high risk of
kidney cancer, as well as mutant VHL alleles found in sporadic kidney cancers, are grossly defective with respect to
the HIF-a regulation.10
This establishes a correlation but not necessarily causation. Both HIF-1a and HIF-2a can activate transcription. The ability of HIF-3a to activate transcription is less
well documented. In fact, some HIF-3a isoforms probably
act as ‘‘dominant negatives’’ to inhibit HIF-a function.13
Clear cell renal carcinomas produce either HIF-1a and
HIF-2a or HIF-2a alone.14 In the laboratory, stabilized
versions of HIF-2a, but not HIF-1a, can override pVHL’s
tumor suppressor functions in vitro and in vivo.15-17 Conversely, down-regulation of HIF-2a is sufficient to suppress
tumor formation by VHL/ renal carcinoma cells.18,19
Moreover, tumor formation by VHL/ renal carcinoma
cells engineered to produce low-risk pVHL variants can be
restored by activation of HIF-2a, whereas tumor formation
by cells engineered to produce high-risk pVHL variants can
be blocked by downregulating HIF-2a.10 These results
argue that deregulation of HIF-2a plays a causal role in
clear cell renal carcinogenesis.
The intimate relationship between pVHL and HIFa, especially HIF-2a, has also been borne out in mouse
models. A variety of mouse models have been created in
which VHL has been inactivated systemically or in specific
tissues. VHL inactivation in the kidney causes cyst formation with low penetrance,20 VHL inactivation in the liver
causes hepatomegaly, steatosis, and polycythemia,21-23
and VHL inactivation in the heart causes cardiomegaly,
heart failure, and tumor formation.24 These abnormalities
do not occur if ARNT1 (but not HIF-1) is simultaneously
inactivated.20,25 Disruption of HIF-2a has been shown to
block the liver changes seen after VHL loss.26,27 In a complementary set of experiments, transgenic production of a
stabilized version of HIF-2a was shown to be largely sufficient to recapitulate the liver and skin (increased angiogenesis and runting) findings observed after VHL
inactivation in these 2 organs.23

Why Is HIF-2a so Dangerous?
Both HIF-1a and HIF-2a have 2 dedicated transcriptional activation domains (transactivation domains),
called the N-terminal transactivation domain (NTAD)
2263

Original Article

and C-terminal transactivation domain (CTAD), that
allow them to activate transcription once tethered to
DNA. The CTADs can be hydroxylated on a conserved
asparaginyl residue by the factor inhibiting HIF-1
(FIH1), which, like the prolyl hydroxylase domain family
members, is an oxygen-dependent enzyme.5 Hydroxylation of the asparaginyl residue prevents the recruitment of
coactivator proteins such as p300 and cAMP-responsive
element binding protein that are required to activate transcription.5 In theory, therefore, the CTAD should be
inactive in pVHL-defective cells (because FIH1 should
remain active). However, recent studies suggest that HIF2a is less sensitive than HIF-1a to the inhibitory effects of
FIH128,29 and that, accordingly, both the HIF-2a NTAD
and CTAD contribute to tumorigenesis.29
In addition, it is becoming clear that HIF-1a, more
so than HIF2-a, can undergo proteasomal degradation in
the absence of pVHL because of either alternative ubiquitin ligases or perhaps a direct interaction with the proteasome.23,30-33 Therefore, pVHL loss leads to pronounced
up-regulation of HIF2-a in a transcriptionally competent
form. The expression of HIF-2a throughout the body is
said to be more restricted than that of its better studied
paralog, HIF-1a, although several reports have now documented increased HIF-2a in a variety of solid tumors,
often associated with a poor prognosis.34-45 Therefore,
HIF-2a may play a broader role in tumorigenesis than
previously thought.

primary cilium.50-54 How, mechanistically, pVHL regulates the primary cilium is not clear, but 2 observations are
noteworthy.
The first factor is the ability of pVHL to regulate the
primary cilium correlates with its ability to bind to,
and stabilize, microtubules.53,55 Notably, some pVHL
mutants linked to a high risk of renal carcinoma retain
this activity, whereas some associated with a low risk do
not.53,55 This suggests a hypothesis, which remains to be
tested, that some VHL-associated renal carcinomas do not
arise from preexisting cysts and that some low-risk VHL
families would manifest renal cysts without cancer.
The second factor is that the loss of the primary cilium on pVHL inactivation also appears to require activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Activation of the PI3KAKT pathway inactivates GSK3, which is another regulator of the primary cilium.53,56 When GSK3 is active, it
inactivates pVHL but itself maintains the cilium. When
GSK3 is inactive, ciliary maintenance falls to pVHL. As a
result, inactivation of both pVHL and GSK3 would, in
theory, be required to fully disrupt the primary cilium in
vivo. In keeping with these ideas, renal cysts in VHL
patients display evidence of GSK3 inactivation, as determined by measurement of an inhibitory phosphorylation
on GSK3,53 and PTEN loss (which activates the PI3KAkt) pathways, cooperates with VHL loss in the mouse to
promote cyst formation in the genitourinary tract.57,58
Regulation of apoptosis

HIF-Independent pVHL Functions
Regulation of primary cilium by pVHL

Renal cyst formation is a prominent feature of VHL
disease. The epithelial cells lining these cysts cavities are
VHL/ and display increased HIF-responsive gene products.46 These lesions are believed to be preneoplastic, and it
is presumed that additional mutations, affecting other
genetic loci, are required to convert them to clear cell renal
carcinomas. Several nonrandom genomic changes have
been described in clear cell carcinomas, in addition to loss
of the VHL locus on 3p25 that might harbor such loci.
Many diseases linked to renal cyst formation affect
the formation of the primary cilium, which is a specialized
antenna-like structure on the cell surface that acts as a
chemical and mechanical (eg, flow) sensor.47-49 Loss of
pVHL, in a HIF-independent manner, leads to loss of the
2264

Kidney cancers are notoriously resistant to conventional cytotoxic agents, possibly because of activation of
prosurvival pathways or inactivation of apoptotic pathways. It has been reported that kidney cancers have
increased NFjB activity,59,60 which can promote survival,
and that pVHL loss activates NFjB.61-63 Both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent links between pVHL and
NFjB have been suggested. With respect to the latter,
pVHL was shown to bind to the NFjB agonist Card9
and to promote its inhibitory phosphorylation by casein
kinase 2.64 Inactivation of Card9 in VHL/ renal carcinoma cells suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo and increased
sensitivity to certain cytokines in vitro.64 Notably, some
pVHL missense mutants linked to kidney cancer retained
the ability to regulate Card9. Therefore, deregulation of
Card9 does not appear to be necessary for renal carcinogenesis but might modulate sensitivity to therapeutics.

FIGURE 1. Kidney cancer targets based upon the biology of pVHL and HIF are depicted. The HIF transcription factor comprises a
labile alpha subunit and a relatively stable beta subunit. The rate of HIFa transcription and translation, and hence, its rate of synthesis, is regulated by mTOR. The rate of HIFa degradation is controlled by the VHL tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) and, at
least for HIF1a, by certain histone deacetylases (HDACs) and HSP90. Whether the effects of HDAC inhibitors on HIFa levels are
secondary to changes in HSP90 activity is not clear. HIF controls the transcription of 100 to 200 genes, many of which are suspected of playing a role in tumorigenesis (examples of which are shown). Two mTOR inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus)
have been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer. Sunitinib and sorafenib, which have also been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer, are both capable of inhibiting the receptors for the HIF-responsive gene products VEGF and PDGF B.

HIF-Responsive Gene Products as
Therapeutic Targets
Many HIF-responsive gene products are suspected of
playing roles in tumorigenesis and can be inhibited with
drug-like molecules. These include genes involved in
angiogenesis (such as vascular endothelial growth factor
[VEGF], platelet-derived growth factor B, stromal cellderived factor [SDF] and CXC chemokine receptor 4
[CXCR4],65,66 transforming growth factor [TGF] b, and
connective tissue growth factor67), glucose uptake and
metabolism (such as HK2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 468,69), pH control (such as carbonic anhydrase 9
and 12), invasion/metastasis (such as matrix metallopeptidase 1,70 SDF and CXCR4, lysyl oxidase,71 c-Met72-74),
and proliferation/survival (such as TGF-a) (Fig. 1).
Kidney cancers are highly angiogenic and have the
highest VEGF levels among various common solid tumors.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Several inhibitors of VEGF, or its receptor KDR, have
demonstrated activity in this disease,75-79 measured as a significant delay until the time of disease progression, and 2
(sunitinib and sorafenib) are approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for this indication (Fig. 1). Typically,
approximately 70% of patients have some degree of tumor
shrinkage. Early data suggest that the benefits of VEGF inhibitor therapy are not restricted to patients whose tumors
are pVHL defective. Among several possibilities, this suggests that VHLþ/þ kidney cancers use alternative pathways
to induce VEGF expression. Unfortunately, essentially all
kidney cancer patients treated with VEGF inhibitors will
eventually experience disease progression. Understanding
the molecular basis for acquired resistance to VEGF inhibitors is an area of current investigation. One possibility,
among several, is that resistance in this setting reflects the
activation of alternative angiogenic pathways.

Inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), which is the receptor for TGF-a, have so far
been disappointing in the clinic,80,81 despite strong preclinical studies indicative of an important role for this receptor in VHL/ tumor growth.82 Whether this lack of
clinical activity is because of inadequate target inhibition
within the tumors or not is an open question. Of note, a
recent report suggested that activation of the c-Met in
lung cancer cells could mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors.83,84 VHL/ renal carcinoma cells are hypersensitive to the c-Met ligand hepatocyte growth factor and
display increased c-Met downstream signaling, probably
involving both HIF-dependent and -independent consequences of pVHL loss.74,85-87

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Inhibitors
and Kidney Cancer
The steady-state levels of HIF-1a and HIF-2a are determined by their rates of synthesis and rates of degradation.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase plays a
critical role in the transcription and translation of HIF-1a
(Fig. 1). HIF-2a has been less studied in this regard.
VHL/ renal carcinoma cells display increased sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors in preclinical models,88 and 2
rapamycin-like mTOR inhibitors (rapalogs), temsirolimus and everolimus, have demonstrated activity in kidney
cancer clinical trials (Fig. 1).77,89 In theory, mTOR inhibitors might affect the tumor cells themselves, in part
through HIF down-regulation, and tumor endothelial
cells, by blocking proliferation and survival signals downstream of the VEGF receptor KDR, which engages the
PI3K, Akt, mTOR pathway.90,91
Mammalian cells have 2 mTOR-containing complexes, TORC1 and TORC2.92 TORC1, which regulates
HIF-1a, is sensitive to rapalogs, whereas TORC2 is not.
Unfortunately, rapalogs inactivate a negative feedback
loop between TORC1 and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, leading to a paradoxical increase in TORC2 activity.93-95 This is important because TORC2 lies upstream
of Akt, whereas TORC1 lies downstream of Akt.92 Activation of Akt might serve to blunt the inhibition of
TORC1 and, more importantly, could lead to protumorigenic effects of Akt mediated by TORC1-independent
pathways. It will be of interest to see whether agents that
2266

block both TORC1 and TORC2, which are currently in
development, are more active than are the rapalogs.
In 1 study, it appeared that the benefits of mTOR
inhibition might be greater in papillary renal carcinoma
than in clear cell carcinoma.89 Although this observation
remains to be repeated, it is of interest that some evidence
indicates that there are some molecular commonalities
between clear cell carcinoma and papillary renal carcinoma. For example, some cases of papillary carcinoma
have been linked to fumarate hydratase mutations, which
lead to HIF-1a up-regulation.96 Other cases of papillary
carcinoma are linked to activating c-Met mutations, and
there is now evidence for a role of c-Met in clear cell
carcinoma.

Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors and Heat
Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors
Both histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors have been reported
to down-regulate HIF-1a in the absence of pVHL (again,
HIF-2a has been less studied in this regard) (Fig. 1).30,31
It is possible that the effects of HDAC inhibitors are, at
least partly, secondary to changes in HSP90 function.
HIF-1a was reported in 1 study to itself be acetylated,97
but this is controversial.98,99 HDAC inhibitors and
HSP90 inhibitors promote the pVHL-independent degradation of HIF-1a, possibly by promoting the interaction of pVHL with Rack1.33 HSP90 inhibitors also affect
other client proteins implicated in renal carcinogenesis,
including cyclin D, c-Met, and EGFR.100,101 Unfortunately, results with a first-generation HSP90 inhibitor in
the clinic have been disappointing.102 Whether this was
due to a failure to adequately inhibit the target is not
known.

Searching for VHL Synthetic Lethal Genes
A conceptually attractive approach to treating VHL/
cancer cells, including kidney cancer cells, would be to
identify genes that are ‘‘synthetic lethal’’ to VHL, that is,
are essential in VHL/ cells but dispensable in VHLþ/þ
cells.103 In a pilot study using short hairpin RNA vectors
directed against 89 different kinases, Reddy and
coworkers104 showed that VHL/ cells have an
increased requirement for Cdk6, MEK1, and c-Met. In
Cancer

Kidney Cancer Treatment/Kaelin

the case of Cdk6, preferential killing of VHL/ cells
was also seen with a chemical Cdk 4 of 6 inhibitor.
Although these results await further confirmation, it is of
interest that all 3 of these kinases are known, or might be
predicted, to play a role in kidney cancer biology. Cdk6 is
a catalytic partner for cyclin D1, and cyclin D1 is upregulated in renal epithelial cells (but not other epithelial cells)
by HIF.105,106 Loss of MEK1 leads to diminished HIFdependent transactivation function, although the mechanism is unknown.107-110 Finally, c-Met is suspected of
playing a role in both clear cell carcinoma and papillary
renal carcinoma, as outlined herein.

Conclusions
VHL tumor suppressor gene inactivation is common in
hereditary and sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas. The
VHL gene product, pVHL, has many functions that
might contribute to renal tumorigenesis. Of these, the
best documented is pVHL’s ability to target the alpha subunits of the HIF transcription factor for destruction when
oxygen is available. HIF is a master regulator of genes,
such as VEGF, that promote adaptation to hypoxia. This
information provides a conceptual framework for understanding the high levels of VEGF produced by kidney
cancers and their sensitivity to VEGF inhibitors. mTOR
inhibitors, by downregulating the rate of HIFa transcription and translation, are capable of downregulating
HIF in the absence of pVHL and are also active in the
treatment of kidney cancer.
HIF-independent pVHL functions have also been
described recently and some of these are also likely to bear
on renal carcinogenesis. For example, pVHL plays a role
in maintaining a specialized structure called the primary
cilum and in suppressing the NFjB transcription factor.
Although the biochemistry underlying these activities
must still be elucidated, the former is likely to be pertinent
to the development of visceral cysts that are characteristic
of VHL disease and the latter to the resistance of kidney
cancer cells to agents that act by inducing apoptosis, such
as the majority of conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral
presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
correspond directly to the written article, which is a more
general review.
Discussion after Dr. William G. Kaelin’s
presentation.
Michael Atkins: It has been mentioned before that
there is a similar HIF signature in clear cell renal cancer
that is VHL wild type. VHL wild-type tumors appear to
respond to some of the same VEGF inhibitor drugs. How
would you explain this since you are selecting for differential sensitivity between a VHL-negative and a VHL wildtype tumor? Are there other factors that happen in VHL
wild-type tumors that essentially phenocopy the VHL
loss?
Dr. Kaelin: It is possible that some VHL plus renal
cell carcinoma cells have nonetheless arrived at a molecular signature that resembles a VHL null cell. If that is the
case, I would predict that some of our synthetic lethal hits
might score there as well.
Robert Figlin: Are many of the effects that we see
with some of the currently available agents endothelial cell
effects, as opposed to antitumor cell effects? How do your
systems help us differentiate between targets that will
affect tumor cell proliferation versus other effects that
genetic factors have on the population of cells?
Dr. Kaelin: VHL and its ability to regulate VEGF is
almost certainly responsible for this finding. In kidney
cancer, you can almost assume a priori that angiogenesis is
driven by VEGF because the moment VHL was mutated,
which was certainly an early event in the VHL patients,
the VEGF levels go through the roof. There is no more
selection pressure to turn on collateral pathways that
might otherwise also induce angiogenesis.
Marston Linehan: Would you be concerned that if
you had a really effective inhibitor of HIF-1 that might
make the kidney cancer worse?
Dr. Kaelin: There may be selection pressure for kidney cancers to get rid of HIF-1. Other work has shown
that although HIF-2 promoted tumorigenesis, maybe
HIF-1, in some cases, might even inhibit cell growth.
Bin Teh: What is the role of VHL in tumorigenesis
as opposed to tumor angiogenesis?
Dr. Kaelin: In addition to promoting angiogenesis,
it is certainly activating some autocrine loops; it is also
leading to upregulation of the cyclin D mechanism and
probably leading to some activation of c-Met and
2267

upregulation of IGFR. In addition, there are HIF-independent functions, one of which is maintenance of the
primary cilium, which is a specialized structure on the cell
surface that senses not only chemical signals but mechanical signals, such as flow in the kidney. We have also shown
a role for VHL regulating NFjB signaling and certain
other pathways that could be part of the cell intrinsic
effect of VHL loss on tumorigenesis.
