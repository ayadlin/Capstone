BACKGROUND: Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after rituximab-containing chemotherapy in patients with
B-cell lymphoma has been recognized as a potentially serious complication in HBV immune patients. METHODS: To
determine the HBV reactivation in patients treated with rituximab, a retrospective study of HBV-related markers was
performed before and after rituximab-containing treatment in 261 consecutive patients with CD20-positive B-cell
lymphoma. RESULTS: Of the 261 patients, 230 patients were tested for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) before treatment. Fifty-six (24.3%) of 230 patients were anti-HBc
positive, and the remaining 174 (75.6%) patients were anti-HBc negative. Among the 56 anti-HBc–positive patients, 5
(8.9%) became HBsAg positive (HBV reactivation), whereas none of the 174 anti-HBc–negative patients became
HBsAg positive with a median follow-up of 24 months (P ¼ .001). Among the 5 patients with HBV reactivation, 4
were negative for antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and 1 patient was positive for anti-HBs. All 5 of these patients were
treated successfully with entecavir on detection of HBsAg, although 4 of the 5 patients exhibited mild to moderate
elevation of alanine aminotransferase. Among 56 anti-HBc–positive patients, those negative for anti-HBs had a higher
probability of developing HBV reactivation compared with those positive for anti-HBs (4 of 19; 21.1% vs 1 of 37; 2.7%,
P ¼ .014). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with isolated anti-HBc are at high risk of HBV reactivation and should be monitored closely for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBV-DNA, and transaminase levels during and after rituximab-containing treatment. Although preemptive use of entecavir enabled successful management of HBV reactivation, mild to moderate
hepatic flare was still observed. These approaches should be further evaluated in a prospective study with regard to

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a well-known complication in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy or

intensive immunosuppression, and preventive use of antiviral agents, such as lamivudine, is recommended in such cases.1
Although HBV infection has a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic self-limiting hepatitis to severe potentially fatal progressive hepatic failure, loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and development of antibody to hepatitis
B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) after acute HBV infection are thought
to represent clearance of HBV. However, studies have indicated that a low level of virus replication persists in the liver and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these patients.2,3
Rituximab is a chimeric mouse human monoclonal antibody and has been used effectively alone or in combination
with cytotoxic agents for treating both low- and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. Several recent reports have suggested that
use of rituximab is related to the development of fatal HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative patients with prior HBV exposure.4-7 HBV reactivation was a rare complication in these patients before the increased use of rituximab. Recently, Yeo
et al8 reported a high incidence of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive patients receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy in Hong Kong. Umemura et al9 reported a high mortality rate of patients with malignant
lymphoma associated with HBV reactivation after use of rituximab in Japan. As HBV infection is endemic in Asia, these

observations are extremely important with regard to
therapy of B-cell lymphoma patients in this area. Here, we
performed a retrospective investigation of the occurrence
of HBV reactivation after rituximab-containing chemotherapy in 252 B-cell lymphoma patients admitted to
Kameda General Hospital, Kamogawa-shi, Japan, over
the past 5 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Consecutive patients with B-cell lymphoma admitted to
Kameda General Hospital between April 2004 and April
2009, who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy
and were followed up for at least 2 months after the start
of treatment, were included in this study (Table 1). After
admission, all of the patients were given a physical examination, blood examination, and serum biochemistry
analysis. All of the patients received chest and abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography of the
abdomen at the time of admission as an initial evaluation.
The study population consisted of 261 patients
(147 male, 57%; 114 female, 43%). The median age of
the patients was 70 years, with a range of 15 to 93 years.
Diagnosis of lymphoma subtypes included diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n ¼ 163, 62.5%), follicular

lymphoma (n ¼ 57, 21.8%), mantle cell lymphoma (n ¼
11, 4.2%), Burkitt lymphoma (n ¼ 6, 2.3%), chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (n ¼ 6, 2.3%), and other B-cell
lymphomas (n ¼ 18, 6.9%). The median number of
rituximab infusions (375 mg/m2) was 6, with a range of 1
to 14, and the median observation period from the start
of treatment was 24 months, with a range of 2 to
56 months. All patients received varied courses of glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone10;
etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and
cisplatin11; and fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone,12 in combination
with rituximab.
Because of the retrospective nature of this study,
individual informed consent was not obtained from all of
the patients. Instead, this study protocol including the use
of frozen stored plasma was approved by the institutional
review board of Kameda General Hospital.
HBV Serology and HBV-DNA
All patients were screened for HBsAg at the time of admission. However, before September 2006, anti-HBs and
anti-HBc tests were performed at the discretion of the
treating physician. Therefore, in patients whose anti-HBs
or anti-HBc were not checked, those antibodies were

checked using frozen sera obtained within 1 month of
admission. There were 13 patients whose anti-HBc and
anti-HBs were not checked their who were found to be
negative for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs after completion of chemotherapy and were considered to be HBVnaive. After October 2006, anti-HBs and anti-HBc tests
were performed for all patients. The sera from 31 of 55
anti-HBc–positive patients were tested retrospectively for
the presence or absence of immunoglobulin (Ig)M class
anti-HBc. When a patient was found to have developed
hepatitis or became HBsAg positive during the course of
treatment, quantitative determination of HBV-DNA was
performed by transcription-mediated amplification13 or
by the Taqman polymerase chain reaction method.14
HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HBc IgM
were detected using commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits (Abbot Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The results of
anti-HBs and anti-HBc are expressed as percentage
inhibition (negative control optic density [OD]  positive control OD), with >50% defined as a positive result.
Definition of HBV Hepatitis and
HBV Reactivation
Hepatitis was defined as a serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) level >3-fold higher than the normal upper limit
of 2 consecutive determinations >5 days apart in the
absence of clinical and laboratory features of acute
infection of hepatitis A, hepatitis C, or other systemic
infections. Although there are no clear diagnostic criteria
for HBV reactivation, we defined HBV reactivation as
seroconversion from HBsAg negative to HBsAg positive
with or without an increase in HBV-DNA level from
baseline (>2.6 log copies/mL).
Statistical Analysis
The rates of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc–negative,
anti-HBc–positive, anti-HBc-positive/anti-HBs-positive,
and anti-HBc-positive/anti-HBs-negative patients were
determined and compared using Fisher exact test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics (Table 1)
Nine of the 261 patients were found to be HBsAg
positive, and were excluded from the analysis. All
9 patients were treated successfully with rituximabcontaining regimens with use of antiviral agents, such as
lamivudine or entecavir, and showed no development of
severe hepatitis.

The background characteristics of the rest of the 252
HBsAg-negative patients are shown in Table 1. Twentytwo patients were not tested for anti-HBc and anti-HBs
before use of rituximab because of unavailability of serum.
Therefore, a total of 230 patients were checked for HBV
serology; 174 (75.6%) patients were found to be antiHBc negative and 56 (24.3%) patients were anti-HBc
positive. Among the 174 patients negative for anti-HBc,
4 were positive for anti-HBs. Thirty-three of the 55 antiHBc–positive patients were further tested for anti-HBc
IgM, and all of them were found to be negative for antiHBc IgM, indicating the absence of recent HBV infection
in these patients.
There was a predominance of male patients in both
the anti-HBc–negative and anti-HBc–positive groups.
However, patients who were not checked for anti-HBc were
predominantly female. Five (2.9%) of the 174 anti-HBc–
negative patients were positive for anti-HBs. Among the 55
anti-HBc–positive patients, 36 (65.4%) were also positive
for anti-HBs, and 19 (34.5%) were negative for anti-HBs.
DLBCL was the predominant lymphoma subtype among
the 3 groups. However, the incidences of follicular lymphoma were lower in the anti-HBc–positive and anti-HBc–
unchecked groups. The median number of rituximab infusions and observation period after the start of rituximab
treatment were comparable among the 3 groups.
Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was performed in 7 and 3 patients in the
anti-HBc–negative and anti-HBc–positive groups, respectively. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed
in 4 patients in the anti-HBc–negative group and in
1 patient in the anti-HBc–positive group.
Consequences of HBV Serology After
Rituximab-Containing Treatment (Fig. 1)
Among the 252 HBsAg-negative patients, 5 (2.0%)
became HBsAg-positive (HBV reactivation) after rituximab-containing treatment. The details of the patients
who became HBsAg positive are shown in Table 2. None
of the anti-HBc–negative or anti-HBc–unchecked
patients became HBsAg positive after median observation
periods of 21 and 28 months, respectively. In contrast, 5
of the 56 anti-HBc–positive patients (8.9%) became
HBsAg positive, and 4 of these patients were negative for
anti-HBs before treatment. The incidence of HBsAg reappearance in anti-HBc–positive patients was significantly
higher (P ¼ .001) compared with anti-HBc–negative
patients. Among the anti-HBc–positive patients, 4 of the
19 patients negative for anti-HBs became HBsAg positive,

vincristine, and prednisone with rituximab15 chemotherapy using high-dose cyclophosphamide and totalbody irradiation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
prophylaxis included standard short-term methotrexate
and cyclosporine A. Although his clinical course was
complicated with development of generalized chronic
GVHD, which was treated with cyclosporine A and prednisone, he obtained clinical remission of lymphoma. He
was anti-HBs positive before and after rituximab-containing treatment, but its titer gradually decreased and disappeared by 7 months, and HBsAg seroconversion was
confirmed 17 months after transplantation (21 months
after completion of rituximab therapy). However, HBVDNA remained below the level of detection (2.6 log
copies/mL), and hepatitis B e antigen was negative. He
received entecavir preemptively based on detection of
HBsAg and showed only mild liver function abnormality.
Four other patients received varied courses of rituximabcontaining chemotherapy. One patient (Case 2) developed hepatitis with the appearance of HBsAg. Serum
levels of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were
elevated to 1117 IU/L and 602 IU/L, respectively, with
no increase in total bilirubin level. HBV-DNA was
increased to 8.5 log copies/mL. The patient was treated
successfully with entecavir (0.5 mg/d), and her HBVDNA became undetectable (3.5 log copies/mL) by
5 months after the start of entecavir, although she
remained positive for HBsAg until 16 months after the
start of entecavir and became negative thereafter.
Three other patients did not develop clinical hepatic
flare despite the appearance of HBsAg and detection of
HBV-DNA in the serum, although slight elevation of
ALT was observed. All patients received entecavir on
detection of HBsAg, and HBV-DNA decreased promptly
in all of these cases.

DISCUSSION
HBV reactivation is a common complication in HBsAgpositive patients receiving hematopoietic transplantation
or immunosuppressive anticancer therapy. Recently, the
risk of developing hepatitis B virus reactivation after
chemoimmunotherapy or organ transplantation in HBsAg–negative but anti-HBs– and/or anti-HBc–positive
patients has been described and characterized by
measuring HBV-associated markers.16-18 However, the
precise frequency and risk factors for developing hepatic
flare may vary among ethnic groups or geographic
regions. In addition, differences in anticancer therapy, use
Cancer

of stem cell transplantation, definition of reactivation,
lack of prospective study, and possibility of missing
seroconversion because of the absence of symptoms could
be responsible for these differences.
Rituximab has significant efficacy in the treatment
of a wide range of B-cell lymphomas. Addition of rituximab to anthracycline-based chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone,
is considered a standard front-line treatment for CD20positive B-cell lymphomas.19,20 In addition, clinical
benefits of rituximab maintenance have also been observed after different treatment protocols.21 However,
rituximab induces profound and prolonged B-cell depletion and has been reported to be associated with varicellazoster virus infection, chronic parvovirus infection,
and cytomegalovirus infection.22-24 Rituximab binds to
CD20 antigen, which is expressed not only on neoplastic
B cells but also on normal B lymphocytes. As B lymphocytes act as antigen-presenting cells for CD8-postive
cytotoxic T cells25 that limit the expansion of HBV infection in hepatocytes, depletion of B lymphocytes by rituximab may result in defective T-cell responses to HBV,
thereby allowing replication of the virus. Use of corticosteroids may also play a role in expansion of HBV, because
HBV-DNA contains a glucocorticoid response element
that facilitates HBV replication.26 Use of lamivudine as
prophylaxis in HBsAg-positive patients scheduled to
receive cytotoxic chemotherapy is advised in HBV
endemic areas, including Japan. However, reactivation of
HBV in HBsAg-negative patients after cytotoxic chemotherapy has been considered a rare event except in patients
undergoing stem cell transplantation.
In the present study, we investigated the occurrence
of HBV reactivation after rituximab-containing chemotherapy in 261 consecutive patients with CD20-positive
B-cell lymphoma. This could be the largest study on the
incidence of HBV reactivation associated with rituximab
use, compared with the previous reported series. In our
study, performed in Kamogawa, Chiba, in the central
part of Japan, 5 (8.9%) of 56 HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc–
positive patients developed HBV reactivation, and the
prevalence rate of occult HBV infection was 24.3%. Four
(21.1%) of 19 patients positive for anti-HBc alone developed HBV reactivation within 7 to 11 months after the
use of rituximab, whereas among 37 patients who were
both anti-HBc- and ant-HBs positive, only 1 (0.4%)
patient who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation
developed HBV reactivation. Similar to our study, Yeo
et al8 described 80 patients in Hong Kong with HBsAg-

negative DLBCL who received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy with
or without rituximab. In 46 patients with anti-HBc, 5
(23.8%) of the 21 patients treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy with rituximab developed HBV reactivation,
whereas none of 25 patients who received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy without rituximab developed reactivation. The
high incidence of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc–positive
and HBsAg-negative patients was attributed to the incorporation of rituximab into cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy. In
addition, our current observation, together with those of
Yeo et al,8 suggests that anti-HBc–positive patients without anti-HBs have a greater likelihood of developing
HBV reactivation after rituximab-containing treatment
compared with patients positive for anti-HBs. However,
Koo et al27 in Singapore and Targhetta et al28 in Cagliari,
Sardinia, Italy, observed HBV reactivation in only 1
(2.2%) of 46 and 2 (2.7%) of 74 patients with anti-HBc,
respectively. Fukushima et al29 in Saga, in the southern
part of Japan, reported that 2 (6.3%) of 32 patients with
occult HBV infection developed HBV reactivation after
rituximab. Although the risk of HBV reactivation in
patients with occult HBV infection after rituximabcontaining therapy seems real, the incidence of reactivation varies substantially among studies. The reason for
the difference in the incidence of HBV reactivation
among the studies remains to be elucidated. However,
the intensity of treatment, patient characteristics, and
geographic differences in HBV may account for these
differences. Remarkable genotype variation has been
reported among the regions in which HBV is endemic.
Studies on the clinical significance of HBV genotype
suggest that the genotype may be correlated with clinical
events,30 although the relationship between HBV genotype
and reactivation of HBV after chemotherapy has not been
determined.
The results of the present study suggest that HBsAgnegative B-cell lymphoma patients who are anti-HBc–
positive but anti-HBs–negative are at high risk of HBV
reactivation after rituximab-containing treatment. Thus,
complete HBV serology, including HBsAg, anti-HBs,
and anti-HBc, should be determined before the start of
chemotherapy or intensive immunosuppression to identify patients at high risk of HBV reactivation. Although
prophylactic use of antiviral agents in HBsAg-positive
patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is the standard

4774

strategy,1 the effect of prophylactic use of such agents in
patients with occult HBV infection remains uncertain.
However, when it occurs, the mortality rate in this group
of patients is high.9 In addition, a proportion of patients
exhibited increases in ALT and HBV-DNA simultaneously, and some patients showed an increase in HBVDNA level before the increase in ALT.31 It is also possible
that HBV-DNA could decline when liver enzyme levels
begin to rise. In the present study, close monitoring of
HBV-related markers and preemptive use of entecavir
after the detection of HBsAg or HBV-DNA successfully
controlled HBV replication and prevented the development of fulminant hepatic failure, although 1 of 5 patients
showed AST elevated to 1171 U/mL. Thus, our current
approach may not be appropriate for prevention of severe
hepatic injury because of HBV reactivation. In addition,
mutation of HBsAg may occur under immunological
pressure, which could result in false-negative results for
detection of HBsAg.32 Intense monitoring of HBV-DNA
with more sensitive assays may be a rational approach.
However, the sampling schedule would be arbitrary, and
HBV-DNA methodology is both expensive and not
widely available. Furthermore, we could not completely
eliminate hepatic flare because of HBV reactivation with
this approach.
Alternatively, use of prophylactic lamivudine until
6 months after completion of anticancer therapy, as
recommended by Yeo et al,8 might also be feasible, as use
of lamivudine before the commencement of chemotherapy successfully reduced the incidence of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive cancer patients.1 Lamivudine
is a relatively safe agent and is cost-effective. However,
long-term use of lamivudine may induce mutation in
the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate motif of the
HBV DNA polymerase gene (YMDD mutation), which
can cause hepatic flare.33 Entecavir is currently the most
potent anti-HBV agent and showed 5 to 6 log suppression
of viral load in HBsAg-positive patients without development of resistance. However, it is expensive compared
with lamivudine, and long-term prophylactic use of
entecavir in patients with HBV reactivation has not been
examined to date. Furthermore, the optimal duration of
antiviral therapy in these patients has not been studied in
depth. Although 6 to 12 months of lamivudine treatment
after discontinuation of chemotherapy has been recommended, extended prophylactic treatment for >12
months may be advisable in patients with high HBVDNA levels.34 These approaches should be evaluated in
the context of clinical usefulness, safety, and cost-

effectiveness for prevention of HBV reactivation-related
morbidity and mortality.
Combined use of rituximab and intensive chemotherapy is associated with the increased incidence of HBV
reactivation in HBsAg-negative but anti-HBc–positive
patients with B-cell lymphoma, especially in endemic
areas. The present study indicated that the risk of HBV
reactivation is significantly elevated in patients who are
HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive. Among antiHBc–positive patients, anti-HBs–negative patients appear
to have higher likelihood of developing HBV reactivation
compared with anti-HBs–positive patients. Although
further studies are needed with regard to prevention of
HBV reactivation, close monitoring of HBV-related
markers including HBV-DNA, and prophylactic or
preemptive use of antiviral agents should be considered
for high-risk patients scheduled to receive rituximabcontaining chemotherapy.
