ABSTRACT
Non-neuronal cholinergic system is involved in lung physiology and lung cancer.
However, the biochemical events downstream acetylcholine (ACh) receptor activation
leading to carcinogenesis and tumor progression are not fully understood. Our previous
work has shown that non-neuronal ACh acts as an autoparacrine growth factor to
stimulate cell proliferation and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via activation of M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R). The
aim of the present study was to delineate the underlying mechanisms linking M2R and
lung tumor progression, which may provide potential therapeutic targets to delay lung
cancer progression. Inhibition of M2R by antagonist or siRNA suppresses NSCLC cell
migratory and invasive capacities, reverses EMT and simultaneously inactivates PI3K/
Akt, MAPK ERK and NF-κB p65. On the other hand, M2R activation stimulates NSCLC
migration and invasion and promotes EMT via NF-κB p65 activation. Moreover, NF-κB p65
activation induced by M2R activation was partially inhibited by either Akt or ERK inhibitor.
Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first time that NF-κB p65 activation is
essential in NSCLC progression associated with non-neuronal cholinergic system. Our data
suggest that M2R/ERK/Akt/NF-κB axis could be a potential target for NSCLC treatment.

factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast
growth factor (FGF), as well as transforming growth factor
β (TGFβ) and their downstream signaling pathways often
involving PI3K/Akt and MAPK ERK pathways [12]. Our
previous studies have shown that non-neuronal ACh, as an
autoparacrine growth factor, induces EMT in NSCLC cells
partially through activation of M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R)
and blocking M2R signaling reverses EMT under basal and
AChR agonist-induced conditions [10]. Activation of nAChR
by nicotine has also been reported to induce EMT in lung
and other cancer cells [13–15]. Those findings have indicated
that non-neuronal cholinergic system could be involved in
the progression of lung cancer through regulation of EMT. A
hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression, which
is mainly mediated by several transcription factors referred to
as EMT master regulators including the Snail, Zeb and Twist
families. The expression of these EMT master regulators
is modulated by numerous signaling molecules, including
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) [12,16–18].

INTRODUCTION
Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter
whose effects are mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors (nAChR) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
(mAChR). Growing evidence has shown that various nonneuronal cells, such as airway epithelial cells and lung
cancer cells can synthesize and release ACh. Non-neuronal
ACh is believed to act as an autoparacrine growth factor
through activation of nAChR and mAChR [1–4]. Our
and many other studies have demonstrated that markedly
upregulated non-neuronal cholinergic system in lung cancer
could be targeted for therapeutic intervention [5–10].
Most lung cancer patients are diagnosed at a locally
advanced or metastatic stage with a dismal five-year survival
rate. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which
was first recognized as critical in embryogenesis, has been
implicated in tumor progression and metastasis [11]. EMT can
be triggered by growth factors including epidermal growth

The NF-κB family has five proteins: RelA (p65), RelB,
Rel, NF-κB1 (p50/p105), and NF-κB2 (p52/p100), each of
which may form homo- or heterodimers. The activated NFκB exists primarily as a heterodimer of p65/p50 or p52/RelB.
In most cell types, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm
in an inactive state by inhibitor of κB-alpha (IκBα). In the
presence of activating signals, IκBα is phosphorylated by
IκB kinase (IKK) leading to its degradation. NF-κB released
from IκBα translocates to the nucleus and regulates the
transcription of target genes by binding to specific DNAbinding sites. Besides the degradation of IκBα and nuclear
translocation of NF-κB dimers, optimal activation of NFκB also requires phosphorylation of NF-κB by a variety of
kinases [19, 20]. NF-κB plays critical roles in the processes
of development and progression of cancers [21]. NF-κB has
been reported to be constitutively activated in most human
cancers, but not in normal tissues [22]. Constitutively
activated NF-κB is also tightly related to the tumor metastasis
[23, 24]. Moreover, evidence has indicated that NF-κB
activation is required for the induction and maintenance of
EMT [25]. NF-κB activation has been found to upregulate the
expression of EMT master regulators including Snail, Slug,
Twist1 and ZEB1/2 to induce EMT [26–31].
In our previous study, we have shown that EMT could
be induced by non-neuronal ACh, secreted by NSCLC cells
partially through activation of M2 muscarinic receptors
(M2R) [10]. The goal of this study is to delineate the
underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we showed that
antagonizing M2R resulted in the inactivation of NF-κB p65,
PI3K/Akt and MAPK ERK as well as the reversal of EMT
and reduced migratory and invasive capacities in NSCLC.
On the other hand, muscarinic activation by pilocarpine
stimulated NSCLC migration and invasion, promoted EMT
and activated NF-κB p65 signaling, all of which was ablated
by specific NF-κB inhibitor or p65 siRNA. Moreover,
pilocarpine-induced NF-κB p65 activation was partially
inhibited by either Akt or ERK inhibitor. Collectively, our
results supported the proposal that non-neuronal ACh may
activate M2R and downstream ERK and Akt to enhance
NF-κB signaling, which promotes EMT and increases
migratory and invasive ability in NSCLC. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that M2R/
ERK/Akt/NF-κB signaling axis plays an important role in
lung cancer progression involving non-neuronal cholinergic
system. Our study may provide potential therapeutic targets
to delay lung cancer progression.

shown in Figure 1A and 1D, cells treated with 1 μM
methoctramine (MT), which is a selective M2R antagonist,
rescued much less wounded region at 72 h after wound
scratch compared to cells treated with solvent (DMSO).
The number of cells migrating through transwell chamber
in both non-basement membrane chamber and matrigelcoated chamber was much lower in MT group than that in
control group (Figure 1C and 1F). These results suggested
that pharmacological blockade of M2R reduced cell
migration and invasion. Next, cells were stably transfected
with scrambled shRNA (Ctrl) or M2R-specific shRNA
(M2R) as described in our previous paper [10] and then
subjected to wound healing assay and transwell migration
and invasion assay. As shown in Figure 2, knockdown
of M2R suppressed the migration (Figure 2A–2E) and
invasion (Figure 2C and 2F) of both PC9 and A549 cells,
confirming that blocking M2R signaling reduced NSCLC
cell migratory and invasive capacities.

Blocking M2R signaling reversed EMT in
NSCLC cells

RESULTS

We then examined the expression of EMT-related
molecules using Western blot analysis in PC9 and A549
cells. As shown in Figure 3A, epithelial marker E-cadherin
was upregulated and mesenchymal markers such as
vimentin or matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) were
downregulated in a dose-dependent manner in both cell
lines treated with methoctramine. EMT master regulators
Snail or ZEB1 were also downregulated by methoctramine
treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results were
further confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments
in A549 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, E-cadherin was
located on the surface of cells while vimentin was located
in the cytoplasm of cells. Methoctramine treatment
reversed EMT by inducing the expression of E-cadherin
and simultaneously repressing the expression of vimentin.
Next, we stably transfected cells with scrambled shRNA
(Ctrl) or M2R-specific shRNA (M2R) and then examined
the expression of EMT-related molecules. As shown in
Figure 3B, knockdown of M2R expression increased the
expression E-cadherin and decreased the expression of
vimentin or MMP9 and EMT master regulators Snail or
ZEB1, confirming that blocking M2R signaling reversed
EMT in NSCLC. The only source of ligand for M2R in
these studies was endogenous ACh released by tumor
cells, suggesting that non-neuronal ACh promotes EMT
partially through activation of M2R in NSCLC cell lines.

explored the effect of methoctramine on the activation of
NF-κB p65. Total cellular extracts, cytoplasmic extracts
and nuclear extracts of PC9 and A549 cells were prepared
for Western blotting analysis following methoctramine
treatment for 72 h. As shown in Figure 4 p65
phosphorylation at Ser536 was decreased in total cellular
(Figure 4A and 4C), cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
(Figure 4B) in a dose-dependent manner in both cell
lines. The phosphorylation of IκBα was decreased while
total IκBα was slightly increased in total cellular extracts
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A and 4C). Taken
together, these results suggested that M2R inhibition by
methoctramine suppressed phosphorylation and subsequent
degradation of IκBα resulting in less nuclear translocation
of p65 and also inhibited phosphorylation of p65, both of
which led to inactivation of NF-κB p65 transcriptional
activity. However, we failed to detect any significant
changes in the levels of p65 expression in the cytoplasm

and nucleus possibly due to the sensitivity of Western blot
analysis. We also examined the effects of selective M1 and
M3 muscarinic receptor antagonists on the activation of
NF-κB p65 and found that none of them had effects on
NF-κB p65 activation (Supplementary Figure S1).

has been used extensively to inhibit NF-κB activation. As
shown in Figure 5A, PTL decreased the phosphorylation
of NF-κB p65 and IκBα, resulting in the inhibition of NFκB signaling in both cell lines. We also used p65-specific

siRNA to knockdown the expression of NF-κB p65 and
as shown in Figure 5C, siRNA-mediated p65 knockdown
significantly decreased the levels of p65 and p-p65. Then,
exogenous muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine was
used to activate M2R signaling. Our results showed that
pilocarpine increased the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65
and IκBα, resulting in NF-κB activation in both cell lines
(Figure 5B). Pretreatment of cells with PTL or siRNA
p65 completely abolished pilocarpine-induced NF-κB
p65 activation (Figure 5B and 5D). Combined with above
results that M2R inhibition by methoctramine suppressed
NF-κB activity (Figure 4), our data strongly suggested for
the first time that NF-κB is the downstream effector of
M2R signaling.
Growing evidence has shown that PI3K/Akt and
MAPK ERK could directly phosphorylate and activate
IKK or phosphorylate p65, either of which leads to NF-κB

activation [32–38]. In Figure 4, pilocarpine has been
shown to induce the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK and
methoctramine to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and
ERK, suggesting that Akt or ERK could be the molecular
link between M2R and NF-κB. We further investigated
the effects of inhibiting Akt or ERK on pilocarpineinduced NF-κB activation, using their respective inhibitor,
LY294002 (LY) and U0126 (U). As shown in Figure 5B,
pilocarpine-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65
and IκBα was completely abolished by PTL treatment.
Moreover, pilocarpine-induced phosphorylation of IκBα
was completed ablated in PC9 cells pretreated with LY
or U and in A549 cells pretreated with U, while it was
only partially ablated in A549 cells pretreated with LY,
suggesting that Akt and ERK could activate NF-κB by
stimulating phosphorylation and subsequent degradation
of IκBα. Phosphorylation of p65 induced by pilocarpine

are coupled with Gi/Go proteins. However, the roles of
mAChR in carcinogenesis and tumor progression are
not fully understood. Our previous work has shown that
blocking M2R signaling can suppress EMT, which is the
key process in cancer progression and metastasis. This
paper extends these previous results to delineate molecular
mechanisms whereby blocking M2R signaling suppresses
EMT, which may provide potential therapeutic targets to
delay lung cancer progression.
EMT is associated with functional changes relevant
to metastasis, i.e. increased migratory and invasive
abilities. During EMT, epithelial cells lose their epithelial
polarity and cell-cell contacts and gain mesenchymal
phenotypes with increased migratory and invasive
abilities. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin,
which is mediated by a network of transcription factors
including the Snail, Zeb and Twist families that target
the CDH1 gene promoter. EMT can be induced by
intracellular cues, such as NF-κB signaling or by
extracellular growth factors. Our previous study and

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer cells can synthesize and secret ACh
which in turn acts as an autoparacrine growth factor to
stimulate tumor growth via activation of nicotinic and
muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChR,
mAChR). nAChR belongs to the family of ligandgated ion channels. Extensive studies have shown that
activation of nAChR leads to channel opening and influx
of calcium which activates signaling cascades involved
in cell proliferation, apoptotic inhibition, migration and
angiogenesis [39–41]. mAChR belongs to G-protein
coupled receptors family and five subtypes of mAChRs
(M1-M5) have been identified. M1, M3, M5 receptors are
coupled with Gq proteins, while M2 and M4 receptors

many others have indicated that non-neuronal ACh, as an
autoparacrine growth factor could induce EMT through
activation of α7 nAChR and M2R [10, 13]. However, the
underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Many studies have reported that NF-κB activation
is closely involved in the induction and maintenance of
EMT [25–31]. NF-κB not only regulates the transcription
of EMT master regulator genes, such as Snail, Slug
and ZEB1, which repress the epithelial phenotype
by downregulating E-cadherin but also controls the
mesenchymal genes, such as VIM. In this paper, we have
shown that M2R selective antagonist methoctramine
inhibits phosphorylation of IκBα and p65, resulting in
the inactivation of NF-κB signaling in NSCLC. However,
antagonizing M1 or M3 mAChR does not inhibit NFκB signaling. Conversely, exogenous mAChR agonist
pilocarpine activates NF-κB signaling. Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibition or genetic disruption of NFκB p65 reverses EMT as well as reduces migratory and
invasive ability in NSCLC. Take together, our results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrate for the first time that non-neuronal ACh could
induce EMT through activation of M2R and downstream
NF-κB signaling.
NF-κB signaling could be directly activated
by PI3K/Akt or MAPK ERK pathways [32–38]. Our
data show that mAChR agonist, pilocarpine stimulates
phosphorylation of ERK and Akt while M2R inhibition
decreases ERK and Akt phosphorylation. More
importantly, inhibition of ERK or Akt partially abolishes
pilocarpine-induced NF-κB p65 activation, suggesting that
non-neuronal ACh may activate M2R and downstream
ERK and Akt to enhance NF-κB signaling.
Dysfunction of the non-neuronal cholinergic system
is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer. In lung cancer,
cholinergic signaling is markedly upregulated which
presents potential therapeutic targets [5–10]. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that M2R/ERK/Akt/NF-κB
signaling axis plays an important role in lung cancer
progression associated with non-neuronal cholinergic
system. NF-κB is also at the center of multiple signaling

NF-κB could attenuate the progression and metastasis
of cancer. Given that NF-κB also plays a pivotal role
in immune system, the challenge is how to target it
selectively in cancer. Blocking the nonredundant, cancerspecific downstream effectors of NF-κB will hopefully
provide new strategies for targeting NF-κB.

M2R shRNA lentiviral particles were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and the lentvirus
transduction was performed as described previously [10].
Cells with stable integration of shRNA constructs were
selected with puromycin (5 μg/ml).

Transwell migration and invasion assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Migration assay was performed in 24-well inserts
(8-μm pore size; Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA) and
cell invasion assay was performed in 24-well Matrigel
invasion inserts (8-μm pore size; Corning Inc, Corning,
NY, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 3 ×
104 cells in serum-free DMEM were seeded in the upper
chamber of the insert and DMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum was added to the lower chamber. Cells were
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 8 h (for migration) or
1 day (for invasion). Nonmigrated cells were scraped from
the upper surface of the membrane with a cotton swab,
and migrated cells remaining on the bottom surface were
fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, stained
with a 0.1% crystal violet solution for 2 hours, and then
photographed and counted under a microscopy from at
least four randomly selected fields.

Cells were allowed to grow to 90% confluency
in 6-well flat-bottomed plates and serum starved for
24 h in medium containing 1% FBS. After aspirating the
medium, the monolayer was scratched using a 200 μL
pipette tip. The cells were washed with PBS to remove
detached cells and then incubated in medium containing
5% FBS with or without 5 μM methoctramine. The
scratched areas were photographed at 0 and 48 h after
scratching using microscopy. Cell migration was
calculated as percentages of open wound area to the
initial blank areas containing no cells using ImageJ
software. The values are the means of three independent
experiments.

Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked in 1% BSA,
and then stained with antibody (1:100) at 4°C overnight.
After being washed three times with PBS, cells were
incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:100) for 1 h, and then washed with PBS again and
incubated with Hoest 33342 for nuclear counterstaining.
Cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSM710 (Zeiss,
Thornwood, NY, USA) confocal microscope.
