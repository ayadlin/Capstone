Abstract
Nanoparticles offer potential as drug delivery systems for chemotherapeutics based on certain advantages of
molecular drugs. In this study, we report that particle size exerts great inﬂuence on the penetration and retention
behavior of nanoparticles entering tumors. On comparing gold-coated Au@tiopronin nanoparticles that were
prepared with identical coating and surface properties, we found that 50 nanoparticles were more effective in all
in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays conducted using MCF-7 breast cells as a model system. Beyond superior
penetration in cultured cell monolayers, 50 nm Au@tiopronin nanoparticles also penetrated more deeply into
tumor spheroids ex vivo and accumulated more effectively in tumor xenografts in vivo after a single intravenous
dose. In contrast, larger gold-coated nanoparticles were primarily localized in the periphery of the tumor spheroid
and around blood vessels, hindering deep penetration into tumors. We found multicellular spheroids to offer a
simple ex vivo tumor model to simulate tumor tissue for screening the nanoparticle penetration behavior. Taken
together, our ﬁndings deﬁne an optimal smaller size for nanoparticles that maximizes their effective accumulation in tumor tissue. Cancer Res; 73(1); 319–30. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The ultimate objective of chemotherapy was to speciﬁcally
kill the cancer cells without any adverse effects. In the past few
decades, nanoparticle-based drug delivery system has shown
unique advantages over small molecules. Some commercially
available nanomedicines are widely used in the clinic for
cancer therapy, including liposomes such as Doxil (liposome
loaded with doxorubicin) and nanoparticles such as Abraxane
(albumin nanoparticle loaded with paclitaxel). Because of
prolonged circulation time and the altered biodistribution of
the chemotherapeutic agent as well as the enhanced drug
solubility of these commercial nanoparticles, the side effect of
the drug was signiﬁcantly reduced, whereas the efﬁcacy of the
drug was, to some extent, restricted because of the limited
nanoparticle penetration into the tumor tissues (1). Generally,

the anticancer drugs must penetrate into tumor tissues efﬁciently and reach to all of the cancer cells in a sufﬁcient
concentration to exert effective therapeutic efﬁcacy (2).
In solid tumors, the microenvironment was complicated,
with poorly organized vascular architecture, hypoxia, and
increased interstitial ﬂuid pressure as well as the presence of
the extracellular matrix (ECM; refs. 3–5). These characteristics
of the tumor microenvironment will signiﬁcantly limit the
delivery of drugs to the cells distant from the blood vessels, and
then the efﬁciency of drug will be subsequently compromised.
Compared with molecular drugs, the penetration behavior of
the nanoparticles in vitro also depends on their properties,
including size (6), shape (7), surface charge (8), the stage of the
cell cycle (9), and so on.
Different from cells in monolayer culture, cells in solid tumor
are exposed to the microenvironment described earlier and to
a gradient of drug concentrations due to their distance from
the blood vessels. In theory, direct in vivo evaluation of the
penetration behavior of the nanoparticles is the most ideal way
owing to the pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles that will
signiﬁcantly affect their accumulation in tumor tissue (10).
Hence, the ex vivo model system is more simple and practicable to evaluate drug penetration, and the multicellular spheroid model is one of the most often used methods. Multicellular
spheroids are spherical aggregates of tumor cells that reﬂect
many properties of the solid tumor microenvironment(2, 11–
14). Recently, it has been reported that the 3-dimensional (3D)
culture system may better reﬂect some of the in vivo aspects
and can be used to further improve the understanding of the
molecular mechanism of action of Herceptin (14). In the
present study, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 tumor spheroid was developed, characterized, and used to qualitatively and

quantitatively evaluate the penetration and retention behavior
of nanoparticles.
The enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect contributed to the passive tumor-targeting of nanoparticles with
the size smaller than 100 nm (10, 15). The sizes of Doxil and
Abraxane mentioned above are approximately 100 and 130 nm,
respectively, and it was found that these nanoparticles were
predominantly located near the blood vessels (1). Hence, size of
the nanoparticles plays a critical role in their penetration and
retention within the tumor tissue (6, 10, 16, 17). The 50 nm
nanoparticles, including gold, silica, and polystyrene nanoparticles, were those that were taken up the most by monolayer
cells (18–22). However, the systematic evaluation of the penetration of nanoparticles into the monolayer cells, tumor
spheroid, and tumor tissue in vivo was not well understood
until now. Gold nanoparticles have shown unique advantages
in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems due to signiﬁcant
improvements in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles with their
ease of fabrication, controllable size and shape, good biocompatibility, tunable surface functionalities, and so on (7, 8, 10,
19, 20). Therefore, gold nanoparticles with different sizes and
similar surface properties were selected in this study. Here, we
hypothesized that smaller nanoparticles have advantages over
the larger ones in terms of penetration behavior not only in
tumor monolayer cells but also the tumor tissue in vivo
(Scheme 1).
To prove our hypothesis, we systematically evaluated whether smaller gold nanoparticles were beneﬁcial for penetration
into cancer cells in monolayer cells in vitro, tumor spheroids ex
vivo, and tumor tissues in vivo. First, we prepared the gold
nanoparticles that measured 50 and 100 nm with identical
surface coatings of tiopronin (Au@tiopronin NP). Tiopronin, a
thiol drug with good biocompatibility, is used to control the
rate of cysteine precipitation and excretion in cystinuria (23).
In addition, tiopronin is used as a stabilizing agent for metal

nanoparticles because its thiol groups can bind on the
surface of nanoparticles to prevent coagulation (24). More
importantly, the carboxyl groups of tiopronin can be modiﬁed
with molecules, peptides, or drugs. In our previous work,
Au@tiopronin NPs that were functionalized with the targeted
and therapeutic peptides showed enhanced efﬁcacy of cancer
therapy (25). Then, the MCF-7 tumor spheroid as an ex vivo
model was developed and characterized to study, in particular,
the penetration and retention behavior of the gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and
biodistribution of the nanoparticles in vivo were carried out in
the tumor-bearing mice.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Gold chloride trihydrate (99.9%, HAuCl43H2O) and N-(2mercaptopropionyl) glycine (tiopronin, C5H9NO3S) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. L(þ)-Ascorbic acid (99.0%) was
supplied by Acros. Sodium citrate (99.5%, C6H5Na3O72H2O)
was obtained from Solarbio. Nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide
of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) grade were bought
from the Beijing Chemical Reagents Institute (Beijing, China).
Stock standard solution of Au (1,000 mg/mL) was obtained
from the National Analysis Center for Iron and Steel (Beijing,
China). All glassware used for the preparation and storage of
gold nanoparticles were cleaned with aqua regia (HCl: HNO3 ¼
3:1, v/v). All chemicals were used without further puriﬁcation,
and Milli-Q water was used throughout this study.
Synthesis of 15 nm Au@citrate seed nanoparticles
Using the standard citrate reduction method, 15-nm Au@citrate NPs were prepared as reported previously (26). Brieﬂy, 0.5
mL of HAuCl4 3H2O solution (1%, w/v) in 50 mL of Milli-Q
water was heated to boiling and then 1.5 mL of sodium citrate
solution (1%, w/v) was added to the boiling solution quickly

with vigorous stirring. After the color change was completed in
5 minutes, the mixture solution was kept boiling for another 15
to 30 minutes and, then, was allowed to cool down to room
temperature with stirring. Finally, the15 nm Au@citrate NPs
were obtained, and the nanoparticles were kept as the seed
solution to synthesize larger gold nanoparticles measuring 50
and 100 nm.
Synthesis of 50 and 100 nm Au@citrate nanoparticles
Both 50 and 100 nm Au@citrate NPs were synthesized
using the seed growth method (27). Generally, 2.25 mL of 15
nm Au@citrate nanoparticle seed solution was mixed with
2.44 mL of HAuCl4 3H2O solution (10 mmol/L) and the
mixture was diluted to 150 mL with Milli-Q water. Then,
100 mL of ascorbic acid solution (0.4 mmol/L) was added to
the above stirring solution at a rate of 10 mL/min with a
peristaltic pump. Finally, the 50 nm Au@citrate NPs in purple
red were obtained. For the preparation of 100 nm Au@citrate
NPs, the method was the same as that of 50 nm Au@citrate
NPs, with the exception that the volume of seed solution and
HAuCl4 3H2O solution (10 mmol/L) were 0.24 and 2.49 mL,
respectively.

Synthesis of 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin nanoparticles
In our study, a surface molecule exchange reaction was
adopted to obtain 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs using
the corresponding Au@citrate NPs. Brieﬂy, the reaction was
carried out with stirring at 40 C for more than 48 hours by
mixing a certain volume of as prepared Au@citrate NPs with
an aqueous solution containing excess of tiopronin. When
the reaction was completed, both Au@citrate and Au@tiopronin NPs were centrifuged 3 times at 10,000 rpm for 30
minutes to remove any residual salt, unbound tiopronin, and
citrate.
To characterize all the gold nanoparticles mentioned earlier,
including 15 nm Au@citrate NPs, 50 and 100 nm Au@citrate
NPs, and 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs, some instruments
including the Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN Transmission Electron
Microscope (TEM; Philips) with 200 kV acceleration voltage,
Nano ZS Zetasizer (Malvern), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS; ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer;
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), Lambda 950 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD;
X0 Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer; PANalytical B.V.) were
used in this work.
Uptake of gold nanoparticles by monolayer MCF-7 cells
The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was maintained
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium with 10% FBS in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. MCF-7
cells were cultured in 6-well plates at approximately 60%
conﬂuence. Thereafter, the medium was removed and 1 mL
of fresh medium containing 50 or 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs at
a dose of 1 nmol/L was added to the wells. After the 24-hour
incubation, cells were washed gently with 150 mmol/L PBS (pH
7.4), digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged at 1,000
rpm for 3 minutes, then collected and counted by Vi-CELL
(Beckman Coulter).

MCF-7 multicelluar spheroid culture
The MCF-7 spheroid was produced by using the liquid
overlay method as previously described (28). Brieﬂy, cells
were detached from the monolayer and single-cell suspension
and were transferred into a ﬂat-bottomed 96-well plate precoated with 1% agarose (w/v) at a dose of 200 mL per well
containing 600 cells. Afterwards, the cells were incubated for
approximately 7 days in the same condition as the monolayer
cells described previously. In addition, the culture medium
was partially (100 mL) replaced by fresh medium every other
day.
Penetration behavior of gold nanoparticles into
spheroids
For the 7-day-old spheroid at the seeding concentration of
600 cells per well, 100 mL medium was replaced by medium
containing 50 or 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs at a concentration of 2 nmol/L; therefore, the ﬁnal treated concentration is 1
nmol/L. After the 24-hour incubation, the spheroids were
taken out using a pipette, and gently washed with PBS for the
following analysis. The distribution of gold nanoparticles in
the spheroid was qualitatively observed using microscopy
under bright and dark ﬁelds. The ultralocalization of gold
nanoparticles in the outer and inner cells of the spheroid was
evaluated by Bio-TEM (JEM-1400; JEOL). In addition, the gold
content in every spheroid was quantiﬁed by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; ELAN DRC-e
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer; PerkinElmer).
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of gold
nanoparticles in tumor-bearing mice
Female balb/c nude mice (18–20 g) were purchased from
Beijing Vital River Laboratories. All care and handling of
animals was carried out with the approval of the Animal Ethics
Committee of the Medical School, Peking University (Beijing,
China). To establish the tumor-bearing mice, the mice were
subcutaneously inoculated with 4  106 cells into the right
ﬂank of the mice. When the average volume of the tumor
reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice were randomly
divided into groups for the study of pharmacokinetics and
distribution of Au@tiopronin NPs.
For pharmacokinetics study, the tumor-bearing mice were
intravenously injected with 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs
at a dose of 5 mg Au/kg. About 30 to 100 mL blood was taken for
sampling from the tail vein with a quantitative capillary at 10
minutes and 1, 3, 8, and 24 hours after administration. In
addition, the nanoparticles were injected in the lower part of
one tail vein, and the blood sample was taken from the other
end of the tail vein, thereby protecting the sample from
contamination. The blood volume was calculated as 0.0778
mL/g body weight, and the blood samples were used to
measure gold content using ICP-MS. For the tissue distribution
evaluation, tissues including tumor, heart, liver, spleen, lung,
and kidney were removed at 24 hours after the injection, and a
part of the collected tissues were used for ICP-MS measurement, Bio-TEM observation, and histologic evaluation,
respectively.

from 11.3 to 38.8 and 5.81 to 40.0 mV, respectively.
The z-potential of gold nanoparticles mainly depends on the
surface modiﬁcation of the nanoparticles. For Au@citrate
NPs, the potential was stabilized with citrate through the
electrostatic interaction between gold nanoparticles and
citrate. For Au@tiopronin NPs, the potential was stabilized
with tiopronin through the formation of the Au–S bond. Free
negatively charged carboxy groups of tiopronin were present
and exposed on the outer surface of Au@tiopronin NPs.
Therefore, the z-potential of Au@tiopronin NPs was lower
than that of Au@citrate NPs.
XPS was used to investigate the different element components on the surface of gold nanoparticles. Figures 1C and 2C
showed the atomic percentage of C, N, S, and Au on the surface
of Au@citrate and Au@tiopronin NPs measuring 50 and 100
nm, which indicated that the molar ratio of S to Au of the 50 and
100 nm Au@citrate NPs were both 0.02; however, the ratio
increased to 0.19 and 0.29 in the 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin
NPs, respectively, showing that the thiol groups have been
bonded to the surface of the gold nanoparticles. The similar
molar ratio of N to Au was also observed at the same time.
Optical absorption spectra of the gold nanoparticles are
related to the shape, size, and dispersion of the gold nanoparticles. When the size of Au@citrate NPs were 49.8 and 101
nm, their visible absorption peaks observed were situated at
534 and 599 nm, respectively (Fig. 2D). In general, with increasing size of gold nanoparticles, the corresponding surface
plasmon resonance peaks would shift toward longer wavelength (29). Figure 2D shows that, after the surface exchange of
tiopronin with corresponding Au@citrate NPs, the surface
plasmon resonance peaks of the Au@tiopronin NPs essentially
remained, which was consistent with the results shown in Figs.
1A and 2A. Meanwhile, the 50 and 100 nm gold nanoparticles
that dispersed in pure water were purple red and yellow slurry
in color. Thus, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the visible
spectrum between Au@citrate and the corresponding Au@tiopronin NPs.
On the other hand, the XRD patterns of all the gold nanoparticles could be indexed to the cubic form of gold with PDF
number of 04-0784 (cubic, a ¼ b ¼ c ¼ 0.2884 nm; d (111) ¼
0.2355 nm). As shown in Fig. 2E, there were 5 primary diffraction peaks at 38.187, 44.385, 64.576, 77.567, and 81.722, respectively, and these could be correspondingly indexed to the
crystal planes of (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) forms of
Au. This result showed that the prepared material was deﬁnitely gold. Further observations showed that the peak shape
was wider than that of the corresponding bulk material, which
is one of the characteristics of nanocrystal materials, and while
the particle is smaller, the corresponding XRD peak is wider
(30). Moreover, calculations carried out on the basis of the
(111) peak line-width at half-maximum intensity roughly
showed that the average size of the nanoparticles were approximately 50 and 100 nm.
Taken together, the data discussed earlier show that we
successfully prepared 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs that
are well dispersed in water and other relevant biologic media,
including 0.9% saline, PBS, 5% glucose, and cell culture medium
(Supplementary Fig. S2), are spherical in shape, and stable for

more than 1 month at 4 C. More importantly, the only difference among these nanoparticles used in this study is the size,
which was a requirement for the following studies.
Uptake of gold nanoparticles by monolayer cells
In this study, the concentration of gold nanoparticles was
calculated from the concentration of gold by ICP-MS measurements for all the experiments according to the equation
reported previously (19). First, the cell viability was investigated by the CCK-8 assay, and the data showed that the
exposure to Au@tiopronin NPs for 24 hours was not toxic to
the MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that there
was good biocompatibility of the nanoparticles; then, the MCF7 cells were treated with 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin NPs at a
concentration of 1 nmol/L. From the images taken under
bright ﬁeld microscopy in Fig. 3A, the uptake of 50 and 100
nm gold nanoparticles was observed. However, after the quantitative analysis by ICP-MS, the proﬁle of the number of gold
nanoparticles in each cell versus the size of gold nanoparticles
indicated that the cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles
occurred in a size-dependent manner at a concentration of
1 nmol/L nanoparticles with 24-hour treatment (Fig. 3B), that
is, more uptake (more than 5 times) was observed for the 50 nm
nanoparticle compared with that of the 100 nm nanoparticle.
In addition, this result was in agreement with the reported
maximum uptake by cells that occurred for the 50 nm citratestabilized gold nanoparticles (19). It has been reported that
only monomeric "glycovirus" (50 nm) substantially entered
cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis more efﬁciently than
smaller or larger nanoparticles (31). Bio-TEM was carried out
to obtain the intracellular distribution of the gold nanoparticles after treatment, and the images in Fig. 3C showed that both
50 and 100 nm gold nanoparticles were localized in the
cytoplasm in an aggregated state after treatment for 24 hours,
and the density of 50 nm gold nanoparticles observed in the cell
was signiﬁcantly more than that of the 100 nm gold nanoparticles, which is in accordance with the ICP-MS results.
Characterization of MCF-7 tumor spheroids
Multicellular tumor spheroids are 1 of the 3D culture
systems that have been proven to have unique advantages
over the 2D culture systems for cancer research (2, 12–14).
Therefore, a spheroid of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was
developed as ex vivo tumor model in this study. To provide
direct evidence of the morphology for the 3D culture, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was carried
out to show that MCF-7 cells formed tightly packed and rounded spheroids as shown in Fig. 4A. In the cellular spheroid,
the cells are spindle shaped and the interactions between
cells are very tight, which is similar to the state in in vivo
tumor tissue while being different from the monolayer cells.
The cell condition in the spheroid was evaluated using
qualitative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and quantitative ﬂow cytometry. The results (Fig. 4B and C) indicated
that cells in the spheroid model cultured for 7 days were able to
be divided into 2 groups. One group comprised of metabolically
active cells with larger size that could be stained with calcein
AM by the live/dead cell vitality assay kit and were mainly

localized in the outer part of the spheroids on H&E staining.
Another group comprised of apoptotic or necrotic cells with
smaller size, which could be stained with EthD-1 and were
distributed in the inner parts of the spheroid. Furthermore, the
cell conditions in the spheroid cultured for 14 days was similar
to that in the spheroid cultured for 7 days, except that many
more apoptotic and necrotic cells were observed with increasingthe culture time from 7 to 14 days.
These results show that the multicellular tumor spheroid
used in this study was actually similar to the tumor tissue in
vivo. Cells in the outer region of the spheroid were corresponding to the tumor tissue located beside the blood vessel, and the
cells were proliferating with sufﬁcient oxygen and nutrients.
However, cells in the inner region were quiescent, similar to the

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor tissue located further away from the blood vessel,
because of decreased availability of oxygen, nutrients, and pH
(11, 13). Therefore, the tumor spheroid was a suitable model for
evaluating the penetration behavior of gold nanoparticles.
Penetration behavior of gold nanoparticles into tumor
spheroids
The penetration behavior of nanoparticles depends on
their properties. For example, positive particles were taken
up to a greater extent by proliferating cells, whereas negative
particles were able to deliver drugs deep into tissues due to
their ability to diffuse quickly (8). To enhance the nanoparticle delivery into the spheroid, arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid peptide-conjugated dendrimers were developed, and
they signiﬁcantly enhanced the entry of dendrimer/siRNA
nanoparticles into the U87 malignant glioma spheroid to
improve siRNA delivery, which was presumably caused
by the decreased integrin-binding afﬁnity in the tumor
model (32, 33). In this study, 50 and 100 nm Au@tiopronin
NPs with the same surface properties were prepared, and
this ensured the possibility of the size effect on the penetration behavior in the tumor spheroid.
Black spheroids were observed (Fig. 5A) after treatment
with 50 and 100 nm gold nanoparticles at a concentration
of 1 nmol/L for 3 and 24 hours, which is caused by the gold
nanoparticles surrounding the spheroids compared with the
spheroid without treatment. To conﬁrm the exact location
site of the gold nanoparticles in the spheroid, H&E staining and
the corresponding dark-ﬁeld microscopic observation were
carried out. As shown in Fig. 5B, gold nanoparticles measuring
50 and 100 nm were primarily localized at the periphery of
the spheroid at 3 hours after treatment, and the penetration of
50 nm nanoparticles increased with prolonging incubation
time from 3 to 24 hours. However, 100 nm gold nanoparticles
were hindered outside the tumor spheroid.
In addition, the quantitative analysis of ICP-MS data showed
the number of gold nanoparticles in each spheroid (Fig. 5C).
After 24-hour treatment, more penetration (more than 4 times)
in the spheroids was observed at the nanoparticle size of 50 nm
compared with that at the size of 100 nm. In addition, the
concentration of gold nanoparticles in the tumor spheroid
increased while prolonging the incubation time from 3 to 24
hours for the 50 nm gold nanoparticles, but not the 100 nm
gold nanoparticles. This result is consistent with the report
that the penetration of the nanoparticles into the spheroid
core was limited to particles smaller than 100 nm (34). As
mentioned above, the ECM presents a transport barrier that
restricts nanoparticle penetration, and collagenase-coated
100 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles showed a 4fold increase in the number of particles delivered to the
spheroid core compared with the untreated nanoparticles
due to the site-speciﬁc degradation of ECM proteins (34).
Bio-TEM was used to evaluate the distribution of these
nanoparticles in the spheroid in terms of microstructure,
and Fig. 5D shows that the location site of 50 and 100 nm
gold nanoparticles was only limited to the several layers of
cells outside of the spheroid, and they were found only in the
cytoplasm of each cell.

nanoparticles into the tumor compartment. To improve the
accumulation of the nanoparticles in the tumor, active targeting can be used to increase cellular internalization and reduce
the clearance of nanoparticles from the tumor interstitium
(38).
To evaluate the accumulation behavior of 50 and 100 nm
gold nanoparticles in the tumor tissue in vivo, the tumorbearing mice were developed. At ﬁrst, the pharmacokinetic
behavior of the nanoparticles was investigated after a single 5
mg Au/kg intravenous injection, and the data indicated that all
of the nanoparticles were eliminated rapidly from the blood
(Fig. 6A). The concentration of Au in blood decreased to 11.0

100 nm nanoparticles were cleared faster from the blood than
the 50 nm nanoparticles. The pharmacokinetics of the nanoparticles can be inﬂuenced by many factors mainly including
the size and surface properties of the nanoparticles affect the
extent of opsonization and clearance. In addition, the presence
of a nonionic, steric stabilizing hydrophilic polymer such as
polyethelene glycol (PEG) has been shown to prolong the
circulation time of the nanoparticles by avoiding opsonization
and subsequent clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic
system (38). Gold nanoparticles used in this study were coated
with tiopronin, and they were opsonized easily by the proteins
and then cleared from the blood.
With regard to the accumulation of gold nanoparticles in
tumor, more amount of gold was detected after 24 hours of

administration for 50 nm NPs (0.42 mg/g) and less for 100 nm
NPs (0.14 mg/g; Fig. 6B). In other tissues, 50 and 100 nm gold
nanoparticles accumulated dominantly in the liver and spleen,
constituting a total percentage of more than 80% of the
injected dose. Furthermore, only small amounts of nanoparticles were distributed in the tissues of lung and heart (Supplementary Table S1). Following the quantitative analysis of
gold content in the tissue, H&E staining and corresponding
dark-ﬁeld microscopic analysis were also conducted to observe
the site where gold nanoparticles were distributed. As shown
in Fig. 6C and D, the 50 nm gold nanoparticles showed a little
more amount than 100 nm gold nanoparticles in the tumor
tissue (Fig. 6C and D), and a nonhomogeneous distribution of
gold nanoparticles was observed. It is speculated that the
nanoparticles were mainly distributed beside the blood vessels,
especially for the larger 100 nm gold nanoparticles. In the liver
and spleen, the distribution of gold nanoparticles is more
obvious. However, no obvious gold nanoparticles were
observed in other tissues such as the kidneys, lungs, and heart
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Recently, researchers have gradually realized that the penetration of the nanoparticles into a tumor is deﬁnitely important for the drug delivery system and it should not be neglected.
To improve the nanoparticle delivery into tumors, functional
nanoparticles, where the size of the nanoparticles shrank from
100 to 10 nm triggered by the matrix metalloproteinases
overexpressed in the tumor microenviroment, exhibited both
long circulation half-life necessary for the EPR effect and the
deep tumor penetration for delivery into the tumor tissues in
vivo (17). In addition, a novel approach of the noncovalent drug
delivery by PEGylated Au NPs showed surprisingly efﬁcient
drug release and deep penetration into the center of tumor
tissues (39). Taken together, the size of the nanomedicines
critically affects the penetration and efﬁcacy of the drugs in
tumors.

Conclusion
In summary, our study provides new insights into the size
effect of gold nanoparticles measuring 50 and 100 nm on the
localization and penetration behavior using 2D culture in vitro,
3D culture of multicellular tumor spheroid ex vivo, and xeno-

graft tumor model in vivo. Although the tumor microenvironment signiﬁcantly limited the deep penetration of nanoparticles into tumor tissue, the smaller gold nanoparticles (50 nm)
showed more advantages over the larger nanoparticles (100
nm) in the uptake and permeability in tumor tissues. Researchers have placed great importance on the prolonged circulation
and altered biodistribution of the nanoparticle-based drug
delivery systems; however, the tumor uptake and tissue penetration of the nanoparticles is another key issue for exerting
effective cancer therapy. More importantly, this study reveals
that smaller nanoparticles are more effective than larger
particles at delivering drugs to tumor cells, with implications
for many types of cancer nanotherapeutic studies.
