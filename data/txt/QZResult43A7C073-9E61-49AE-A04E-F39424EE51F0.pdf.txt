Abstract

Author Manuscript

Claudin-low tumors are a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no targeted treatments and
a clinically documented resistance to chemotherapy. They are significantly enriched in cancer stem
cells (CSCs), which makes claudin-low tumor models particularly attractive for studying CSC
behavior and developing novel approaches to minimize CSC therapy resistance. One proposed
mechanism by which CSCs arise is via an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and reversal
of this process may provide a potential therapeutic approach for increasing tumor
chemosensitivity. Therefore, we investigated the role of known EMT regulators, miR-200 family
of microRNAs in controlling the epithelial state, stem-like properties, and therapeutic response in
an in vivo primary, syngeneic p53null claudin-low tumor model that is normally deficient in
miR-200 expression. Using an inducible lentiviral approach, we expressed the miR-200c cluster in
this model and found that it changed the epithelial state, and consequently, impeded CSC behavior
in these mesenchymal tumors. Moreover, these state changes were accompanied by a decrease in
proliferation and an increase in the differentiation status. miR-200c expression also forced a
significant reorganization of tumor architecture, affecting important cellular processes involved in
cell-cell contact, cell adhesion, and motility. Accordingly, induced miR200c expression
significantly enhanced the chemosensitivity and decreased the metastatic potential of this p53null
claudin-low tumor model. Collectively, our data suggest that miR-200c expression in claudin-low
tumors offers a potential therapeutic application to disrupt the EMT program on multiple fronts in

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Breast cancer is not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with multiple
subtypes. The majority of claudin-low breast cancers are characterized as triple negative,
with no amplification of HER2 or expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and
very poor prognosis. A unique feature of these tumors is lack of cell-cell adherens and tight
junction genes, such as E-cadherin and claudins (1). Loss of these genes is also
characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that governs
metastatic dissemination, during which cells lose cell-to-cell junctions, breach the basement
membrane, and disseminate (2,3). Accordingly, in-depth characterization of claudin-low
tumors revealed a significant overlap between their core genetic profiles and those of cells
undergoing EMT (1,4,5). Notably, cells that undergo EMT often acquire properties
associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs) (6). Consistently, claudin-low tumors are enriched
in functional CSCs (7). Increasing evidence suggests that treatment resistance of cancers,
including breast, is the result of residual CSC subpopulations that are capable of
regenerating the epithelial components of a recurring tumor by intrinsic self-renewal
mechanisms (8,9). Consequently, as claudin-low tumors exhibit properties associated with
both EMT and CSC self-renewal, they are highly resistant to conventional radiation and
chemotherapy (7,8).
Several transcription factors are known EMT inducers, including Zeb1/2 and Snail/Slug,
(2,3). These factors bind to the promoter region of E-cadherin (Cdh1) and repress its
expression. Downregulation of E-cadherin leads to loss of epithelial characteristics and a
significant increase in expression of several mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin and
vimentin. Importantly, E-cadherin causes decreased cell proliferation through contact
inhibition (10), whereas loss of E-cadherin promotes metastasis by increasing cell motility
(11).

Author Manuscript

Another central regulator of EMT is the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family, which consists of
five members that are located in two gene clusters (miR-200c-141 and miR200a-b-429) (12).
These miRNAs maintain cells in an epithelial state by forming a double-negative feedback
loop with Zeb transcription factors (13). Pursuant to their role in EMT, miR-200 members
also regulate self-renewal capabilities of both normal and breast cancer stem cells (14), and
their expression is lost when cells transition into a stem-like state (15).
Previous studies demonstrated that constitutive overexpression of miR-200 reverses EMT in
multiple cancer cell lines (16,17); however, these studies almost uniformly constitutively
expressed miR-200, and although they uncovered many direct targets of miR-200 and
provided insight into its biological functions, the effects of miR-200 expression in primary

tumors in an in vivo context have not been fully characterized. Here, we show that induced
expression of the miR-200c-141 cluster in an in vivo CSC-enriched claudin-low tumor
model, decreased tumor growth and stem cell functionality, and resulted in loss of EMT
features, accompanied by an increase in chemotherapeutic sensitivity. The model we utilize
was developed by transplanting the p53null mammary tissue into wild-type recipient Balb/c
mice (18). p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancers, and confers poor prognosis
and chemoresistance (19). Spontaneously arising p53null murine mammary tumors showed
significant heterogeneity, recapitulating the properties of their human counterparts in
subtype clustering (20). Derived murine claudin-low tumors exhibit a significant overlap in
their gene expression profile with human claudin-low breast cancers, as well as the spindloid
morphology, and are representative of human claudin-low cancer behavior, as illustrated by
their pathology following serial transplantation, maintaining their mesenchymal properties
and CSC enrichment (21,22). Therefore, they represents an improved syngeneic model to
investigate agents that target the EMT pathway and CSC behavior, as we can monitor tumor
response in orthotopic sites with an appropriate microenvironment and an intact immune
system in a wild-type background, while employing the treatment regime potentially
applicable in a clinical setting.

Results
miR-200c induction impairs tumor growth

Author Manuscript

MiR-200c suppresses progression of multiple tumor models propagated from established
cell lines (16,23,24). However, most of these studies focused on reversal of EMT in vitro
with constitutive expression of miR-200c prior to tumor establishment. Any potential
clinical application would require miR-200c to be manipulated after tumor diagnosis. To
determine the effects of miR-200c expression on established primary tumors in vivo, we
used a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible lentiviral vector to express the miR-200c-141 cluster
(miR-200c for simplicity) in our genetically-engineered transplantable p53null claudin-low
tumor model (21,25). This vector allows for visualization of transduced cells by constitutive
expression of GFP. Upon DOX administration, transduced cells upregulate both, miR-200c
and RFP, allowing us to identify and isolate miR-200c-expressing cells. We confirmed the
induction of RFP by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 1A), and the corresponding induction of miR-200c by quantitative PCR
(qPCR), as well as miR-141 (Supplemental Figure S1A). Importantly, the level of miR-200c
expression achieved in DOX-treated tumors fell within the range of miR-200c expression
observed in other p53null, non-claudin-low breast cancer subtypes (20) (Figure 1B).

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of miR-200c induction on overall tumor growth, tumor volume was
measured daily for duration of DOX treatment. Vehicle-treated group exhibited a high
average daily tumor growth (130 mm3 per day), whereas DOX treatment resulted in its
significant reduction (50 mm3 per day) (Figure 1C). Correspondingly, tumor weight at the
end of treatment was significantly lower in the miR-200c-expressing group (Figure 1D).
Notably, DOX treatment did not cause a decrease in tumor growth of non-transduced
claudin-low tumors, confirming that the observed growth inhibition was due to miR-200c
induction (Supplementary Figure S1B). Immunofluorescent staining and subsequent

quantification of Ki67 revealed that the growth defect is due to a significant decrease in the
level of proliferation (Figure 1E). Moreover, injecting the same number of freshly isolated
primary RFP+ (mir200c-induced) or GFP+ (mir200c-deficient) sorted cells into orthotopic
sites of wild-type mice revealed a significant decrease in tumor latency in miR-200cexpressing group (Figure 1F). These data further confirm that cells with high expression of
miR-200c exhibit decreased proliferation in vivo.
Induced expression of miR-200c reverses EMT in vivo

Author Manuscript

One hallmark of claudin-low tumor phenotype is the spindloid nature of tumor cells,
underlining their EMT characteristics. After inducing expression of miR-200c, we observed
a change in morphological properties that suggested a reversal of EMT, as hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining showed that tumor cells lost their mesenchymal features, and seemed
to switch into a more organized epithelial phenotype (Figure 2A). Consistent with this
phenotypic change, we observed a significant induction of E-cadherin mRNA and protein
levels by qPCR and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analyses, respectively (Figure 2B).
Of note, RPPA showed no change in E-cadherin levels in DOX-treated tumors when they
were transduced with a control lentivirus expressing a luciferase reporter rather than
miR-200c, confirming that these changes were dependent on miR-200c expression.

Author Manuscript

Surprisingly, no difference in vimentin mRNA levels was detected between DOX-treated
and untreated tumors (Figure 2C). However, there was a decrease in vimentin protein levels
in tumors following miR-200c induction, as shown by immunofluorescent staining (Figure
2D, separate images shown in Supplemental Figure S1C.). Specifically, vimentin was lost in
cells that were positive for E-cadherin. To compare the cells expressing miR-200c to control
cells, we sorted cells from primary tumors based on their GFP or RFP positivity. Although
there was a significant difference in the mRNA levels of Zeb2 between the sorted
populations by qPCR, no such difference was observed in Zeb1, Snai2, and N-cadherin
(Figure 3A). However, RFP+ cells from DOX-treated group had significantly lower levels of
these mesenchymal proteins (Figure 3B), implying that their expression is controlled at the
level of translation, rather than transcription or mRNA turnover.
Induced expression of miR-200c enhances differentiation of claudin-low tumors in vivo

Author Manuscript

Previous studies revealed low expression of basal and luminal lineage markers in claudinlow tumors, highlighting their undifferentiated state (22). To investigate whether reversal of
EMT by miR-200c induction affected the differentiation profile of this claudin-low tumor
model, we performed immunostaining for well-known keratin markers of basal and luminal
lineages. Indeed, we found that DOX treatment led to an increase in expression of basal
marker keratin-14 that co-localized with increased expression of luminal marker keratin-8
(K8), as seen by double-immunofluorescence staining (Figure 4A), as well as single staining
shown in Supplemental Figure S1D. Additionally, upregulated K8 expression was observed
primarily in cells with low vimentin expression, based on immunofluorescence analysis of
sorted GFP+ and RFP+ cells (Supplementary Figure S1E).
To further investigate the effects of miR-200c expression on the differentiation of claudinlow tumors, we performed a microarray analysis on sorted GFP+ and RFP+ primary cell

populations and compared their overall differentiation scores. The transcriptional similarity
of tumors to normal mammary cell populations, referred to as the differentiation score (1),
was determined for our claudin-low tumor model, with and without miR200, and compared
to the scores of multiple murine subtypes of breast cancer (21). Low differentiation scores
indicate a similarity to adult mammary stem cells, medium scores a similarity to luminal
progenitor cells, and higher scores a similarity to mature luminal cells (1). Consistent with
observed upregulation of keratin expression, microarray analysis demonstrated a significant
increase in the tumor differentiation score following miR-200c induction (Figure 4B).
Interestingly, differentiation of the miR-200c-induced tumors was more similar to the
differentiated basal tumors than to the undifferentiated claudin-low tumors from which they
originated. Further analysis revealed significant changes in expression of 1457 genes
between the two cell populations, with 562 being downregulated and 895 being upregulated
in miR-200c-induced population (Figure 4C). Gene Ontology analysis of the 895
upregulated genes showed an enrichment for categories related to cell-cell adhesion and
contact, consistent with the concept of an EMT reversal upon miR-200c expression (Figure
4D).
Functional cancer stem cells are diminished in miR-200c expressing tumors

Author Manuscript

Because EMT properties are linked to stem-like cell behavior and claudin-low tumors are
highly enriched in CSCs, we sought to determine if reversal of EMT that occurred following
miR-200c induction also altered CSC frequency in our model. Indeed, cells with miR-200c
induction exhibited significant decreases in expression of the stem cell-associated genes
Ezh2 and Bmi1 (Figure 5A), previously shown to be direct targets of miR-200c, and
increased levels of the differentiation markers Elf5 and Gata3 (Figure 5B), in further support
for the role of miR-200c in promoting a more differentiated cell state with a concomitant
decrease in stem-like cell properties. Next, we analyzed tumor cells by FACS, using the cell
surface antigens CD24 and CD29 to identify the CSC-enriched population (CD24high/
CD29high) (22). FACS analysis revealed a change in overall profile and a decrease in the
number of double-positive cells in tumors with miR-200c expression, suggesting a reduction
in CSCs (Figure 5C).

Author Manuscript

To validate the decrease in CSC frequency observed by FACS, we also performed functional
assays to measure CSC activity. First, we evaluated the mammosphere forming efficiency
after DOX administration. Notably, we found a significant decrease in the number and size
of mammospheres formed in the miR-200c-induced group, demonstrating that miR-200c
significantly impairs CSC functionality in claudin-low tumors (Supplementary Figure S2A–
B). To confirm these findings in vivo, we performed a limiting dilution transplantation assay,
which is the standard method to determine the in vivo repopulating ability, or CSC
frequency of cells after transplantation. We injected decreasing numbers of GFP+ and RFP+
sorted cells into recipient mice, with continued DOX administration, and evaluated the
number of resulting tumors. Consistent with the results of the mammosphere assay, we
found that miR-200c expression significantly reduced CSC frequency and repopulation
potential of primary tumor cells (Figure 5D). These data validate that stem cell functionality
is severely impaired after miR-200c induction in claudin-low tumors.

Chemotherapy resistance is compromised in tumors expressing miR-200c

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The claudin-low subtype of breast cancer is highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy,
and a claudin-low signature was observed in residual chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer
(7). In this study, miR-200c expression markedly decreased CSC functionality of these
tumors, and enhanced their differentiation. Therefore, we evaluated whether it also
sensitized tumors to chemotherapy drug carboplatin. To this end, we applied either
combination or single agent treatment for a course of 10 days. Although DOX treatment
alone led to a decrease in tumor growth, combination treatment with DOX and carboplatin
caused complete tumor stasis, with a significantly lower growth rate than the other groups
(Figure 6A). Additionally, the final change in tumor volume was significantly decreased in
combination-treated group as compared to all other treatment groups (Figure 6B). As
claudin-low tumors are resistant to single carboplatin treatment due to high percentage of
CSCs (26), we hypothesized that combination of DOX and carboplatin led to the death of
miR-200c-expressing cells, as these had diminished CSC functionality. Accordingly, we
performed FACS analysis using Annexin V staining to determine the extent of apoptosis in
treated tumors. After combination treatment, there was a 10-fold increase in the level of
apoptosis compared with untreated mice. This observation was further strengthened by the
fact that combination treatment eliminated the miR-200c-expressing cells, as seen by a
decrease in the total number of RFP+ cells. Indeed, almost half of the RFP+ cells were
Annexin V-positive and were, therefore, undergoing apoptosis (Figure 6C–D). Of note,
miR-200c induction alone lead to an increase in cell death; however this phenotype is
amplified by carboplatin addition. Further H&E analysis showed that these cells were
undergoing mitotic catastrophe, as seen by a significantly higher number of giant,
multinucleated cells (27) in tumors that had undergone combination treatment, compared to
normal mitosis of vehicle treated tumors (Supplementary Figure S3A). In addition,
combination treatment led to an increase in collagen deposition in tumors, as noted by
Mason’s Trichrome staining (Supplemental Figure S3B), presumably due to the wound
healing response that occurred in response to the high level of cell death. Taken together, our
data suggest that re-expressing miR-200c in therapy-resistant tumors leads to
chemosensitization by increasing their susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced cell death.
MiR-200c induction decreases metastasis

Author Manuscript

Metastasis is strongly correlated with angiogenesis in primary tumors (28–30). Thus,
considering that miR-200 members have been reported to control the levels of proangiogenic factors in several cancer models (31,32), we next investigated whether miR-200c
induction affected pro-angiogenic factors in our model. Although we observed no change in
VEGFR protein levels, we found a significant loss of a prominent metastasis-related protein
PDGFRβ in RFP+ compared with GFP+ sorted primary tumor cells (Supplemental Figure
S3C). Importantly, PDGFRβ expression correlates with breast cancer aggressiveness and
metastasis in human patients, and coincides with EMT-associated metastasis in transgenic
mice (33). Therefore, we asked if miR-200c induction and the corresponding
downregulation of PDGFRβ correlated with a decreased metastatic potential of primary
claudin-low tumor cells. To address the role of miR-200c in pulmonary colonization, we
performed tail-vein injections of GFP+ sorted cells after transduction and started DOX
treatment 16 hours post-injection. This allowed the cells to travel to the lungs prior to

miR-200c induction. After 8 weeks of treatment, induction of miR-200c led to a significant
decrease in the number of lungs containing any histologically detectable metastatic lesions
(Figure 7A), and importantly, a decrease in the metastatic burden (Figure 7B).
Representative images of whole lungs (Figure 7C), as well as H&E stained sections (Figure
7D), are shown. Collectively, our data suggest that miR-200c re-expression in claudin-low
tumors may provide a novel therapeutic approach, as it reduces tumor growth, decreases the
number of functional CSCs, sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy, and ultimately,
decreases metastatic potential.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Given the central position of the miR-200 family in the process of EMT, restoration of its
expression has a tremendous impact on mesenchymal and stem-like properties of cells
(15,16,34,35). Although it was previously shown that miR-200c overexpression reduces
mesenchymal features in several in vitro immortalized cell lines, this study for the first time
utilized an in vivo primary syngeneic tumor model of breast cancer that has a gene
expression signature which parallels those of human claudin-low tumors. Additionally,
several studies confirmed that this model closely mimics human claudin-low tumors in their
pathology and CSC enrichment (1,20,21). Here, we demonstrate that induced expression of
the miR-200c cluster in vivo altered underlying CSC features of claudin-low tumors, making
them more sensitive to chemotherapy and dampening their metastatic potential. These
effects were achieved through EMT reversal, decreases in proliferation and stem cell
functionality, and ultimately, an enhanced susceptibility to cell death.

First, we showed that induction of miR-200c pushed tumor cells into more organized
epithelial-like structures and significantly reduced their proliferation. These changes were
accompanied by an increase in differentiation score, suggesting a change in stem cell
context. Since more differentiated tumors are thought to originate from cells that have more
limited progenitor potential, they display less therapy resistance and tumor recurrence (9,36)
than human and mouse CSCs (7,37,38). Indeed, our results conclusively showed that
miR-200c-expressing tumors had a significant decrease in frequency, as well as functional
self-renewing potential of CSCs, shown by limiting dilution transplantation, and that they do
not transition into a more proliferative epithelial-like CSC state, as suggested by a recent
study (39). Importantly, the change in CSCs observed upon miR-200c re-expression led to
their heightened sensitivity to carboplatin. Accordingly, miR-200c-expressing cells also
showed a significant reduction in expression of stem cell markers Ezh2 and Bmi1, shown
previously to be direct targets of miR-200 (14,40,41). Interestingly, previous studies
demonstrated that knockdown of these proteins decreases breast CSC frequency and
increases their sensitivity to therapy (40,42,43). Our data support the concept that miR-200c,
potentially via its regulation of Ezh2 and Bmi1, can influence functionality and frequency of
CSCs in vivo, a finding that could be exploited to overcome therapy resistance manifested in
CSCs-enriched tumors. Furthermore, significant loss of Zeb1 protein upon miR-200c reexpression suggests a potential decrease in DNA repair capacity (44), which may in turn
increase the susceptibility of miR-200c-induced tumors to chemotherapy.

MiR-200c plays a central role in preventing EMT; thus, it is considered to be anti-metastatic
within primary tumors. Nonetheless, there is considerable controversy regarding its role in
promoting metastatic growth at the secondary tumor site. Some studies suggested that,
although the promotion of EMT increases the intravasation potential of cancer cells, reversal
of EMT, or MET, must occur at secondary sites for cells to be able to revert into the
epithelial state in the distant organ and form macrometastases (17,45). However, these were
performed with miR-200 over-expressing tumor cell lines prior to injecting them into the tail
vein, or from the orthotopic site, where they grew with high miR-200c expression. Another
study showed that high miR-200c levels in lung tissue correlate with higher metastatic
burden and poorer prognosis (46). However, this result was observed only in luminal
subtypes of breast cancer, whereas basal-like breast cancer exhibited worse survival with
decreased miR-200c expression (31). In support of these data, high miR-200 levels were also
found to be anti-metastatic in triple-negative breast cancer cells transplanted into an
orthotopic site of mouse mammary glands (47). Unfortunately, our p53null claudin-low
model is not suitable for investigation of metastasis from the orthotopic site, as it is not
feasible to detect distant metastasis prior to sacrifice of the animals. Alternatively, we
resected the primary tumors early during tumor progression, but after several months no
metastases were observed in either of the groups, vehicle or DOX treated. An immune T-cell
response to claudin-low tumors in syngeneic mice may inhibit intravasation in this model.
However, our tail-vein injection studies suggest that even if intravasation did occur, the
growth of macrometastases in the secondary site would be impeded by miR-200c, as we
compared the extravasation and colonization potential of primary claudin-low tumor cells
with and without miR-200c expression. These studies indicated that miR-200c induction not
only inhibits primary tumor growth, but also decreases the metastatic potential of claudinlow tumors, most likely by decreasing colonization. Additional studies should be performed
to study the role of miR-200c in cell survival in the bloodstream and extravasation into the
lungs in this model.

Multiple RNAi therapeutics are currently being tested in clinical trials, and several groups
have already reported in vivo microRNA delivery using nanoparticles with very promising
results (48). Hence, our studies offer a potential target of microRNA delivery for clinical
treatment of an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is otherwise highly resistant to
conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Success of these therapeutic approaches will
depend upon improvements in both efficiency and specificity of these delivery systems. In
this study, we demonstrate that miR-200c has therapeutic effects in an in vivo model of
claudin-low breast cancer, which should provide the basis for clinical applications in miRbased drug development to treat this subtype of breast cancer. Finally, the detailed
characterization of this transplantable in vivo model provides the foundation for future
studies in which the interplay of EMT and the immune system can be investigated in
therapeutic response and metastasis, something that has not been feasible to date using the
current cell line and xenograft models.

Claudin-low tumors from the p53null mouse tumor bank (20) were digested into single cells
according to our laboratory protocol (see below), transduced with the lentivirus containing
the insert at an MOI of 20, as previously described (49), and injected into the cleared fat pad
of wild-type Balb/c recipient mice. Detailed protocols can be found at the following website
addresses: https://mediasrc.bcm.edu/documents/2014/bc/

1000 mm3 and again digested into single cells. Cells were analyzed and sorted for GFP
positivity. Ten thousand GFP+ cells were injected into the cleared fat pads of host mice.
Upon tumor palpability, the mice were randomized into treatment groups. GFP+ tumors
were frozen in DMEM media containing 10% DMSO and 10% FBS for future transplants.
Treated tumors were digested and sorted for GFP+ and RFP+ cells. Sorted cells were
washed in PBS and either flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA or protein isolation, or
injected back into host mice at different dilutions for the limiting dilution transplantation
assay. Limiting dilution analysis was performed using the ELDA program (50). All cell
injections and surgeries were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All animal protocols were
reviewed and approved by the Animal Protocol Review Committee at Baylor College of
Medicine. Balb/c mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories.

in TBS/T. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA in TBS/T and incubated overnight at
4°C. Protein bands were visualized on autoradiography films. RPPA analysis was performed
in the core of Dr. Gordon Mills at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Flow Cytometry

Author Manuscript

Single cells were labeled with antibodies for CD24-PeCy7 and CD29-PacBlue, or Annexin
V-PacBlue (BD Pharmingen), based on the manufacturer’s data sheet. Lineage cells were
excluded using the BD Pharmingen lineage cocktail. Dead cells were excluded by staining
with Sytox Red (1:1000).
Microarray analysis
Microarray was performed and analyzed as previously described (21). GEO accession
number is GSE62230.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times, with n≥3 biological replicates in
each group, unless otherwise noted. Two-tailed paired Student’s t-test was applied when
only 2 groups were compared. Bars represent mean ± s.d. of ≥ three mice per group
(*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001). One-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey p-value
adjustment was applied to multiple group comparisons.

Figure 1. miR-200c decelerates tumor growth

Author Manuscript

(A) RFP was induced in tumors after DOX administration, as seen by FACS analysis and
fluorescent microscopy. Scale bar represents 5mm. (B) miR-200c was induced to a
physiological level, compared with its levels in different subtypes of p53null tumors (20), as
shown by qPCR. (C) Tumor growth, as measured by the daily increase in tumor volume, was
significantly lower in the DOX-treated group compared with untreated controls. (D) Tumor
weight at the end of the treatment showed that the miR-200c-expressing tumors were much
smaller than untreated controls. (E) The Ki67 proliferation marker was significantly
decreased in miR-200c-induced tumors, revealing that the tumor growth deceleration was
due, in part, to a lower proliferation rate. Scale bar represents 50μm. (F) Tumor latency
increased with miR-200c upregulation. Equal numbers (5 000) of GFP+ and RFP+ cells
were injected into the cleared fat pads of wild-type Balb/c recipient mice, and tumors were
palpated every day to establish their latency, while maintaining vehicle or DOX treatment.

Figure 2. miR-200c alters claudin-low tumor morphology and causes MET

Author Manuscript

(A) Significant morphological changes were observed in tumors with induced miR-200c, as
shown by standard H&E staining. Scale bars represents 50μm. (B) qPCR showed that Ecadherin mRNA was highly induced post-DOX. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA)
analysis showed a significant upregulation of E-cadherin protein in miR-200c-induced
tumors, but not in tumors containing luciferase (FF3). The two bands represent runs with
two different validated antibodies, according to the RPPA core. (C) There was no change in
mRNA levels of vimentin following DOX administration, as shown by qPCR. (D) Images of
immunofluorescent staining show that vimentin protein expression was decreased in cells
that were positive for E-cadherin staining. Scale bar is 50μm.

Figure 3. miR-200c upregulation leads to a decrease in protein expression of several
mesenchymal markers

(A) Other mesenchymal markers showed either a significant decrease (Zeb2), or no
significant change (Zeb1, Snai2, and N-cad) by qPCR. (B) Western blots show a dramatic
reduction in Zeb1 and N-cad, as well as Snai2 protein levels in DOX-treated cells. Protein
was isolated from primary tumor cells that were sorted for GFP or RFP positivity to isolate
untreated and DOX-treated cells, respectively.

Figure 4. miR-200c induction alters the differentiation state of claudin-low tumors

Author Manuscript

(A) Images of immunofluorescent staining show that luminal and basal markers, specifically
K8 and K14, were upregulated after miR-200c induction, suggesting a change in their
differentiation profile. Scale bar represents 50μm. (B) Microarray analysis confirmed this
enhanced differentiation by revealing a significant increase in the differentiation score of
miR-200c-expressing primary tumors compared with our no dox treated tumors. Note that
the miR-200c tumors had a differentiation score close to the basal tumors, and no longer fell
into the claudin-low category. The classes of murine tumors are as described in detail
previously (51), where Myc, Erbb2 and Neu tumors are of luminal subtype clustering, and
p53null-basal, class 14 and C3-tag cluster into the basal subtype. (C) Microarray analysis
also revealed a significant change in 1457 genes, with 562 being down-regulated, and 895
being up-regulated after treatment with DOX. The microarray analysis was performed on
RNA extracted from GFP+ or RFP+ cells sorted from primary tumors, and the heatmap
depicts genes with a 0% FDR. The analysis was consistent with a reversal of EMT, as many
of the genes found to be downregulated are associated with the mesenchymal state, such as
FoxC2, and also confirmed the induction of several keratin markers. (D) The graph indicates
the top 12 most significantly enriched gene ontology terms in the 895 miR-200c upregulated
gene set. Importantly, most of them were related to terms describing cell-to-cell adhesion
and motility.

Figure 5. Stem cell functionality is compromised after miR-200c induction

(A) There was a significant decrease in the stem cell markers Ezh2 and Bmi1 by qPCR postDOX treatment. (B) Conversely, the mRNA levels of the luminal progenitor marker Elf5 and
the mature luminal marker Gata3 were increased in RFP+ cells, compared with GFP+ cells.
(C) A representative FACS profile for CD24+/CD29+ cells shows a change in the overall
profile of miR-200c tumors, with the number of double-positive cells decreased relative to
untreated controls. (D) Table depicts the results from the limiting dilution transplantation
assay. As decreasing numbers of either GFP+ or RFP+ sorted cells were transplanted back
into the recipient mouse, fewer tumors arose in each transplantation group. The RFP+
miR-200c-expressing cells showed a significantly reduced CSC frequency, as shown in the
bottom row, confirming that miR-200c leads to a reduction in stem cell functionality.

Figure 6. miR-200c sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy

Author Manuscript

(A) DOX and carboplatin combination treatment caused tumor stasis, as seen by a
significant difference in the growth rate of combination group, compared to all other
treatment groups. Arrows point to the time of carboplatin injection. (B) There is a significant
decrease in the average change in volume after treatment (n=20 for carboplatin+DOX group,
n=15 for DOX only, n=8 for vehicle and carboplatin alone groups) (C–D) AnnexinV FACS
analysis shows a significant increase in the number of cells undergoing early stages of
apoptosis in the combination treatment group, as compared to all other groups. Sytox red
staining represents dead cells, therefore cells positive only for AnnexinV were considered
currently undergoing apoptosis. Analysis included only GFP+ or RFP+ cells, therefore
AnnexinV positive cells are represented only through these gates, and quantified to the left.

Figure 7. Metastatic potential is severely impaired following miR-200c induction

(A) Table shows that the percentage of tumor-bearing lungs was significantly reduced in the
miR-200c-induced group. Data was analyzed using a Chi-squared test for two populations.
(B) The average areas of metastasis were also lower in the miR-200c-induced group
compared with the vehicle-treated group. (C) Fluorescent images of GFP and RFP
expression shows metastasis present in the lung of both groups. Scale bar equals 5mm. (D)
Representative H&E images of lungs are shown following 8 weeks of DOX treatment after
tail-vein injection of 30 000 primary GFP+ cells. Scale bar equals 100μm.
