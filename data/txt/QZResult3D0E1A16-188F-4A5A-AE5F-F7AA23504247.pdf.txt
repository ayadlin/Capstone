Abstract
A close connectivity between autoimmune and tumor rejection responses is known to exist in the case of melanoma
immunotherapy. However, relatively little is known about selfantigens on other types of normal cells, their relation to the
development of autoimmune disease, and their possible coexistence as potential tumor rejection antigens on associated
tumors. In the current study, we induced inflammatory killing of normal prostate tissue in situ using a fusogenic membrane glycoprotein along with the immune adjuvant hsp70.
We show here that, in the prostate, hsp70 induces interleukin
(IL)-6, which triggers a CD4- and CD8-dependent progressive
autoimmune reactivity, associated with IL-17 expression. This
autoimmune response was also able to induce the rejection
of established prostate tumors, but not other histologic types
of tumors, growing elsewhere in the animal. These data show
that the intimate connectivity between autoimmune and tumor
rejection responses extends beyond the classic melanoma
paradigm and may be clinically valuable for the treatment
of established metastatic disease of the prostate. [Cancer Res

Introduction
A close link between development of tumor immunity, with
concomitant induction of autoimmune reactivities, has been welldocumented in both preclinical and clinical model systems. This is
particularly true for melanoma, where many melanoma antigens
are known to be unaltered self-proteins of melanocytes (1, 2).
Hence, successful immune therapies against melanoma also run
the risk of developing immune reactivity against normal melanocytes (1, 3). There is frequently—but not always (4)—a correlation
between the induction of tumor immunity and concomitant
development of autoimmune pathology, most principally vitiligo,
correlated with CD8, CD4, and humoral responses to melanoma
antigens (1, 2, 5, 6). Strategies that enhance the potency of antitumor T-cell responses often also increase the severity of autoimmune variables (5–7). The positive prognostic importance of the

development of autoimmune disease in patients undergoing immunotherapy for melanoma has recently been convincingly shown in
a large-scale clinical trial (8).
The established paradigm for tumor vaccination uses tumor cell–
derived immunogens to raise T-cell responses against tumor antigens that may then be accompanied by autoimmune antimelanocyte
responses (2, 9). Often, such vaccines require a potent adjuvant
to promote the breaking of tolerance to tumor-derived antigens. In
this respect, we (10–12) and others (13–18) have shown that hsp70
can act as powerful inducer of tumor immunity and converts
tolerogenic antigen presentation into immunostimulatory presentation to break tolerance and induce autoimmune disease (19). Heat
shock proteins can enhance immunogenicity as chaperones of
immunogenic peptides (15–17), cytokines (17, 18), immunogens (20),
and their ability to mature dendritic cells (19). We have also shown
that hsp70 induces proinflammatory cytokines from monocytes (12)
after ligation to receptors including Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4
(18, 21), and that it also acts directly upon macrophages to suppress
secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and phagocytosis (12), and that hsp70
is a key mediator of immunogenic cell death (10–12), thereby
mediating effective tumor vaccination (10–12).
However, obtaining tumor cells, lysates, or derivatives; identifying relevant tumor antigens; and developing vectors that can
specifically target systemic tumors in vivo can be time consuming,
expensive, and problematic. In this respect, we recently described a
completely novel approach to tumor vaccine design by targeting
readily accessible normal tissues in situ as a source of immunogen
(9). We hypothesized that by inducing ‘‘stressful death’’ of normal
cells (melanocytes), it would be possible to generate autoimmune
responses, which may then be effective against tumor cells
(melanoma) that share antigens with the normal tissue (1, 3). We
showed that killing normal melanocytes, in the presence of the
potent immune adjuvant hsp70 (10–12, 19, 22, 23), generates T-cell
reactivity against established melanomas. Intradermal plasmid
DNA injections of a transcriptionally targeted cytotoxic gene [tyrosinase promoter driving the expression of the herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene], along with a plasmid expressing
hsp70 (10), induced direct in vivo inflammatory killing of normal
melanocytes, broke tolerance to self-antigens, and led to rejection
of systemic tumors (21, 24, 25). In this system, hsp70 acts through
TLR-4 signaling and local induction of tumor necrosis factor-a to
promote migration of antigen presenting cells to the lymph node
(21). Progressive autoimmune disease was inhibited (24, 25)
because the antimelanocyte CD8+ T-cell response was rapidly
suppressed by regulatory T cells (24–26). In addition, in suboptimal
therapeutic protocols, the T-cell response selected aggressive,
amelanotic, antigen loss B16 tumor variants (24, 25). Moreover,

addition of a plasmid expressing CD40L increased antitumor
efficacy, generated potent immunologic memory but also induced
aggressive autoimmunity (21).
From these, and other data, it is clear that self-reactive T cells
exist in the periphery that have escaped thymic deletion and can,
if correctly activated, kill both melanoma cells and normal mela-

nocytes (1, 2, 6, 8). However, there is a relative paucity of data
concerning the link between autoimmune responses to other
tissues and their relevance to generating immune responses
against tumors of the same histologic type. In particular, loss of
melanocytes is not life threatening and can be tolerated
considerably better than metastatic melanoma (8). In the current

IL-6 induction. A, C57Bl/6 mice (two per
group) were injected intraprostatically
with 109 pfu Ad-GFP, Ad-hsp70, or
Ad-VSV-G. Three days later, injected
prostates were recovered and used to
prepare cDNA, which was analyzed
by PCR for IL-6 or glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase. B, prostates
from three different C57Bl/6 mice were
recovered, weighed, and two blocks of
30 mg of prostate tissue per mouse were
dissociated separately in culture. Explanted
cultures were allowed to settle overnight.
The following day, one of the two cultures
from each animal was incubated with
recombinant murine hsp70 (10 Ag/mL)
for 24 h, while the second duplicate culture
was treated with bovine serum albumin.
Twenty-four hours later, culture
supernatants were recovered and assayed
for levels of IL-6 by ELISA as shown.
Error bars represent the SD from three
wells per sample in the ELISA assay.
Results are representative of two separate

report, we investigated whether the principles that we observed in
the melanocyte/melanoma system also hold true for the prostate.
In response to the intentional induction of inflammatory killing of
the prostate, we observed progressive autoimmune destruction of
the prostate in response to the intentional induction of inflammatory killing, associated with induction of IL-6 and a Th-17
response but with no detectable Treg induction. Correspondingly,
inflammatory killing of normal prostate was highly effective at
curing established metastatic prostatic tumors but not tumors of
a different histologic type. Our results are significant in several
respects. They show that autoimmune disease of the prostate can
be induced by specific cytokine responses to one, or a few, key
pathogenic-like signals. They show that the intimate connectivity
between autoimmune and antitumor rejection responses extends
beyond the classic melanoma paradigm; and they suggest that
the principle of inflammatory killing of normal cells to treat
neoplastic disease is applicable to tumors other than just
melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, plasmids, and viruses. Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the
mouse prostate (TRAMP)-C2 (TC2) cells are derived from a prostate tumor
that arose in a TRAMP mouse and were characterized by Dr. Esteban
Celis. These cell lines express a variety of prostate-specific genes, including

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

PSMA, Hoxb-13, and NKX3.1. TC2 cells grow in an androgen-independent
manner and have a reduced level of expression of MHC class I which can
be up-regulated by IFN-g, making them susceptible to specific lysis by
CTL. We routinely grow TC2 tumors in C57Bl/6 male mice. The murine
melanoma B16.F1 tumor cell line has been previously described (27). Cell
lines were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FCS (Life Technologies) and L-glutamine (Life Technologies). All cell
lines were monitored routinely and found to be free of Mycoplasma
infection.
The replication-defective adenoviral vectors used in this study were all
E1 deleted serotype 5 vectors that contains the cytomegalovirus (CMV)
immediate-early gene promoter-enhancer driving the inserted transgene.
Ad-VSV-G expresses the cDNA of the fusogenic membrane G glycoprotein of
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G; ref. 27–29); Ad-hsp70 contains the cDNA
of the inducible murine heat shock protein 70 gene (30); and Ad-GFP
contains the cDNA of the green fluorescent protein gene (31).
In the CMV-ova plasmid (CMV-ova), the ovalbumin gene (27) is driven by
the CMV promoter in pCR3.1 (Invitrogen).
Histopathology of tumor sections. Prostates were harvested and fixed
in 10% Formalin in PBS, then paraffin embedded and sectioned. H&Estained sections were prepared for analysis of tissue destruction and gross
infiltrate. Two independent pathologists examined H&E sections, blinded to
the experimental design, and scored the degree of necrosis.
Reverse transcriptase PCR. Organ samples were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. RNA was prepared with the Qiagen RNA extraction kit. One
microgram of total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20 AL volume
using oligo-(dT) as a primer. A cDNA equivalent of 1 ng RNA was amplified

by PCR for a variety of murine cytokines or vector-derived transgenes as
described previously (27, 32) (details of the primers upon request).
Treg-mediated inhibition of IFN; secretion from activated T cells.
OT-I mice are transgenic mice whose T cells express the Va2 chain of the
transgenic OT-I T-cell receptor that specifically recognizes the SIINFEKL
peptide from the chicken ovalbumin protein (ova) in the context of H-2Kb
as expressed by B16ova tumor cells (33). For preparation of naive OT-I T
cells, spleen and lymph nodes from OT-I–transgenic mice were combined
and crushed through a 100-Am filter to prepare a single-cell suspension.
RBC were removed by a 2-min incubation in ACK buffer (sterile dH2O
containing 0.15 mol/L NH4Cl, 1.0 mmol/L KHCO3, and 0.1 mmol/L EDTA
adjusted to pH 7.2–7.4). OT-I T cells were activated by incubation of

splenocyte populations with the cognate antigen recognized by the OT-I T
cells. Single-cell suspensions from spleen and lymph nodes were adjusted to
1.0  106 cells/mL in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium plus 5% FCS,
105 mol/L 2-ME, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin and
stimulated with 1 Ag/mL SIINFEKL peptide and 50 IU/mL human IL-2
(Mayo Clinic Pharmacy). This routinely induces large amounts of IFN-g to
be expressed from the activated OT-I T cells.
To assay for the presence of T-cell suppressive (Treg) activity within
splenocyte populations from intraprostatically injected mice, 250,000 freshly
harvested splenocytes from treatment groups were plated along with 105
naive OT-1 CD8+ T cells in the presence of either no added peptide, an irrelevant nonactivating peptide (TRP-2 180188 SVYDFFVWL; ref. 34), or with the

by PCR for IL-17 or GAPDH. Results are presented as a ratio of the cytokine signal to the GAPDH signal for each treatment over at least three experiments, and
a sample gel is shown. B, the cDNA obtained from the experiment described in Fig. 2B (lymph node draining the prostates injected with adenoviral vectors)
was also screened for expression of IL-17 as shown. The GAPDH control in this experiment is the same as in Fig. 2B . In addition, C57Bl/6 mice were treated
intraprostatically with 109 pfu Ad-GFP, Ad-hsp70, Ad-VSV-G, or 5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5  108 pfu Ad-hsp70. Eight days later, 106 cells from the draining lymph
nodes were cultured for 24 h. Supernatants were assayed for IL-17 using ELISA (eBioscience).*, positive on 30 additional cycles. C, C57Bl/6 mice were injected
intraprostatically with no virus (lane 1) or with 109 pfu of Ad-GFP (lane 2); intradermally with the Tyr-HSVtk/CMV-hsp70 plasmid combination that we have previously
shown induces Treg cells (refs. 24, 25; lane 3) or with 5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5  108 pfu Ad-hsp70 (lanes 4–6 ). Fourteen days postviral or plasmid injection (lanes 1–3,
7, 8), or 4 or 41 days postviral injections (lanes 4 and 6), splenocytes were recovered from treated mice and 250,000 were plated with 105 naı̈ve OT1 CD8+ T cells with
H2Kb-restricted ova peptide SIINFEKL in triplicate, and 48 h later, supernatants were assayed by ELISA for IFN-g. Lane 7, OT-1 with no added splenocytes; lane 8;

i.p. injection of either a control immunoglobulin (Ig ) or the anti-CD25 Treg-depleting PC61 antibody (0.5 mg) 2 d before the intraprostatic plasmid/viral injection.
After surgery, the mice recovered. One week later, 500,000 splenocytes per treatment group were harvested and cocultured with the H-2Kb restricted ova peptide
SIINFEKL in triplicate, and 48 h later, supernatants were assayed by ELISA for IFN-g. Results shown are representative of two different experiments.

synthetic H-2Kb–restricted ova peptide SIINFEKL (33) in tissue culture
wells. Splenocyte/OT-I cocultures were stimulated in triplicate and supernatants were assayed for IFN-g production by ELISA. The degree of suppressive activity in the test splenocyte cultures is reflected by their ability to
inhibit the IFN-g response of the naı̈ve OT-I T cells when presented with
their cognate, activating SIINFEKL antigen. The dependence of any such
T-cell suppressive activity on expression of transforming growth factor-h
(TGF-h; ref. 35) was assayed using the recombinant human TGF-h sRII/Fc
chimera (R&D Systems), a 159 amino acid extracellular domain of human
TGF-h receptor type II fused to the Fc region of human IgG1.
Antigen priming assays—splenocyte preparation and antigen
presentation. Splenocytes enriched in lymphocytes were prepared from
spleens from treated/vaccinated animals by standard techniques (36).
Freshly purified splenocyte populations were washed in PBS and either
incubated with target tumor cells (TC2 or B16) typically at ratios of 100:1,
10:1, or 1:1 or, where appropriate, were pulsed with 1 Ag/mL of the target
peptide for which antigen specificity of response was being tested [SIINFEKL
for induced responses to ova (33) or TRP-2180188 SVYDFFVWL (34) as the
negative irrelevant antigen control]. Forty-eight to seventy-two hours later,
cell-free supernatants were tested for IFN-g by ELISA (PharMingen). The
synthetic H-2Kb–restricted peptides TRP-2180188 SVYDFFVWL (34) and Ova
SIINFEKL (33) were synthesized at the Mayo Foundation Core facility.
ELISA analysis for IFN; secretion. For ELISA, cell-free supernatants
were collected from sample wells and tested by specific ELISA for IFN-g or
IL-6 (BD OptEIA IFN-g; BD Biosciences) or IL-17 (R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturers’ instructions.
In vivo studies. All procedures were approved by the Mayo Foundation
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57Bl/6 mice or B6.129S2IL6tm1Kopf /J [IL-6 knockout (IL-6KO); Jackson; No.002650] were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory at ages 6 to 8 weeks. To establish s.c. tumors,
2  105 B16 cells or 2  106 TC2 cells, in 100 AL of PBS were injected into
the flank of mice. Intraprostatic injections (50 AL) were performed on mice
under anesthetic, typically at day 6 after tumor establishment. For survival
studies, tumor diameter in two dimensions was measured thrice weekly
using calipers, and mice were killed when tumor size was f1.0  1.0 cm in
two perpendicular directions.
Immune cell depletions were performed by i.p. injections (0.1 mg per
mouse) of anti-CD8 (Lyt 2.43) and anti-CD4 (GK1.5), both from the
Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility, Mayo Clinic; and IgG control
(ChromPure Rat IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch) at day 4 after tumor
implantation and then weekly thereafter. For Treg depletion, 0.5 mg of PC61 antibody (Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility, Mayo Clinic) per mouse
was given i.p. 4 days after tumor implantation and 2 days before the first
viral injection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of spleens and
lymph nodes confirmed subset specific depletions.
Statistics. Survival data from the animal studies was analyzed using the
log-rank test (37), and the two-sample unequal variance Student’s t test
analysis was applied for in vitro assays. Statistical significance was determined at the level of P value of <0.05.

Results
Inflammatory killing of normal prostate induces ongoing autoimmune destruction. Previously, we used plasmids expressing the
HSVtk suicide gene and hsp70 to target killing of normal melanocytes
in the skin (21, 24, 25). Because HSVtk requires active division of target
cells for cytotoxicity, in the current studies, we used an adenoviral
vector expressing VSV-G, the fusogenic membrane glycoprotein (FMG)
from VSV (27), to induce killing of normal prostate cells. We have
previously shown that killing induced by fusion of cells using viral FMG
can be potently immunogenic through the fusion of cells into
multinucleated syncytia (27, 28). In addition, we used a second
adenoviral vector to express the murine hsp70 gene (30).
Direct intraprostatic injection of an adenovirus-expressing GFP
(Ad-GFP) did not induce any detectable lasting damage to the
prostates of C57Bl/6 mice either in terms of the architecture of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

the organ or immune infiltration (Fig. 1A). Injection of Ad-hsp70
alone induced an inflammatory response associated with a dense
inflammatory infiltrate and some loss of normal architecture
(Fig. 1A). Significant immune infiltration was also observed with
injection of Ad-VSV-G alone and, in addition, syncytial-like
structures were observed in injected prostates, consistent with
the fusogenic activity of the VSV-G protein (Fig. 1A). Intraprostatic
injection of Ad-VSV-G and Ad-hsp70 caused severe infiltration,
necrosis, and tissue destruction (Fig. 1A) consistent with our
experience of intradermal injection of plasmids expressing HSVtk
and hsp70 (24, 25). Unlike those experiments, however, the dense
infiltration with immune cells was persistently present in prostate
tissue and did not significantly resolve up to 3 weeks postinjection
(data not shown). This persistent inflammation was associated with
an ongoing autoimmune destruction of the prostate as reflected
by a progressive decrease of the wet weight of prostates recovered
from treated animals (Fig. 1B; P < 0.01 for Ad-GFP and Ad-VSVG+Ad-hsp70).
Hsp70 induces IL-6 from prostate tissue. A screen of injected
prostates by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for different
cytokines indicated that IL-6 was consistently induced in prostates
injected with Ad-hsp70 (whether or not Ad-VSV-G or Ad-GFP were
also injected; Fig. 2A). These results were confirmed at the protein level by treating explanted and dissociated prostate with
recombinant hsp70 (Fig. 2B; P < 0.001 for all three prostates tested
when compared plus or minus hsp70). We also assayed the lymph
nodes draining the injected prostates to investigate the profile of
cytokine expression induced by local inflammatory killing, which will
directly influence the outcome of T-cell priming. Lymph node
draining the injected prostates again showed IL-6 expression in mice
injected with the Ad-hsp70 vector (but not in mice injected with
other adenovirus vectors, indicating that IL-6 is not a response to the
adenovirus per se; Fig. 2B). Importantly, TGF-h was expressed in the
majority of the lymph node, largely irrespective of the adenovirus
vectors that were injected into the associated organs (Fig. 2B).
Lymph nodes draining the prostates undergoing inflammatory killing contain IL-17. The ongoing autoimmune inflammation and destruction of the prostate, combined with the detection
of both IL-6 and TGF-h in the lymph node draining the injected
prostates, suggested that Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 treatment of prostate may generate progressive autoimmunity through induction of
a Th-17 response, differentiation of which is characterized by a
combination of TGF-h and IL-6 (38–40). Consistent with this hypothesis, mRNA for IL-17 was detected in both prostates injected with
Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 (Fig. 3A) and also in the draining lymph node
(Fig. 3B). This result was confirmed at the protein level in lymph
node (Fig. 3B; P < 0.001 for treatment with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70
compared with all the other three treatments).
It has been reported that in the presence of TGF-h, the presence
or absence of IL-6 acts a critical mediator between the differentiation of CD4 cells into either Th-17 (IL-6 present) or Treg (IL-6
absent; refs. 38–40). Because TGF-h was present in lymph node
draining the injected prostates, and IL-6 was induced in response
to hsp70 (Figs. 2 and 3), we tested for the generation of Treg
responses. Splenocytes recovered from normal mice (uninjected)
cannot significantly suppress IFN-g secretion from activated T cells
in the presence of their cognate antigen (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 7;
P > 0.05). We have previously shown, however, that splenocytes
from mice undergoing inflammatory killing of normal melanocytes
contain suppressor activity associated with the generation of Treg
and TGF-h [refs. 24, 25; Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 7; P < 0.002 (Tyr-HSV/

hsp70/i.d.)]. In contrast, splenocytes from mice injected intraprostatically with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 were unable to exert any
suppression of activated T cells in this assay (as represented by the
positive control of OT-1 cells alone; lane 7) even when spleens were
harvested at different times after prostatic injection (Fig. 3C and
lanes 4–7; P > 0.05), suggesting that inflammatory killing of normal
prostates does not induce significant Treg responses.
The repertoires of known tissue/tumor-associated antigens in
prostate cancer are much less well-characterized than for the mela-

noma model. Therefore, we used the ova as a model antigen to
characterize how inflammatory killing of normal cells affects the
generation of antigen-specific responses. Thus, when a plasmid
expressing the ova protein was coinjected into the prostates of
C57Bl/6 mice along with different adenoviral treatments, both
Ad-VSV-G (P < 0.02 compared with Ad-hsp70/CMV-ova) and, more
potently, Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 (P < 0.01) primed easily detectable
antiova responses in splenocytes from those mice (Fig. 3D). This
antiova reactivity was neither enhanced nor diminished in mice in

or B6.129S2-IL6tm1Kopf /J (lanes 1–4 ) mice were injected intraprostatically with 109 pfu of Ad-GFP (lanes 3, 4, and 6) or with 5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5  108 p.f.u
Ad-hsp70 (lanes 1, 2, and 5 ). On day 8, 250,000 splenocytes were plated with 105 naı̈ve OT-1 CD8+ T cells with H-2Kb-restricted ova peptide SIINFEKL in triplicate,
and 48 h later, supernatants were assayed by ELISA for IFN-g.

was analyzed by PCR with primers specific for IL-6, IL-17, or TGF-h. PCR for GAPDH showed equal loading (data not shown).

which Treg had previously been depleted by antibody treatment
before viral injections (no significant difference between lanes 1
and 4).
Taken together, these data indicate that inflammatory killing of
normal prostates does not induce a significant Treg response.
Loss of IL-6 converts a Th17 response into a Treg response
in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that the IL-6 response
of prostate tissue to hsp70 expression drives the resultant
immune response against tissue-associated self-antigens down a
Th17 pathway. To test the central importance of IL-6, we repeated
several of these experiments in IL-6KO mice. Whereas injection of
Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 into the prostates of C57Bl/6 mice led to
progressive chronic destruction of the prostates associated with
intense immune infiltration (Fig. 1), no significant damage or
infiltration was observed in similarly injected prostates of IL-6KO
mice, and there was no difference between injection of Ad-VSVG+Ad-hsp70 or Ad-GFP (Fig. 4A). Similarly, there was no
significant difference between the wet weights of prostates of
IL-6KO mice injected with either Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70, Ad-GFP, or
PBS 60 days after viral injection (data not shown)—in contrast to
the reduction in prostate weights of up to 50% seen in C57Bl/6
mice (Fig. 1).
However, we did observe a dramatic difference in the ability
of splenocytes from IL-6KO mice, injected intraprostatically with
Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70, to suppress IFN-g secretion from activated
T cells. Whereas splenocytes from Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70-injected
C57Bl/6 mice contained no detectable suppressive activity in this
assay (Fig. 3C), splenocytes from IL-6KO mice were potently
inhibitory to activated T cells when the prostates had undergone
inflammatory killing with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70—but not with
intraprostatic injection of Ad-GFP [(Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2) compared with lanes 3 and 4; P < 0.01, in all cases]. The mechanism
of this suppression was shown to be dependent in large part on
TGF-h. Thus, when splenocytes from IL-6KO mice, treated
intraprostatically with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70, were cocultured with
activated OT-1 T cells; IFN-g production from the OT-1 T cells
was significantly inhibited as shown in Fig. 4B. These splenocytes
were also cocultured with activated OT-1 in the presence of
50 ng/mL of 341-BR TGF-h sRII/Fc (R&D Systems), a 159 amino
acid extracellular domain of human TGF-h receptor type II fused
to the Fc region of human IgG1, to neutralize TGF-h. In two
such experiments, 341-BR TGF-h sRII/Fc increased the amount of
IFN-g secreted by activated OT-1 and in the presence of
splenocytes from IL-6KO mice treated with Ad-VSV-G+Adhsp70, by f5- to 6-fold (mean values of 130 pg/mL in the
absence of 341-BR TGF-h sRII/Fc to 710 pg/mL in its presence)—
approaching the levels of IFN-g produced by splenocytes of
IL-6KO mice injected with Ad-GFP as the negative control
(815 pg/mL). These data indicate that the suppressive effects of
splenocytes from IL-6KO mice on activated T cells is mediated,
in part at least, by TGF-h.
To confirm the transition of the immune response to inflammatory killing from a Th-17 autoimmune response to Treg protective
immunity in these IL-6KO mice, we studied the microenvironment
of the injected prostates. As before, prostates of C57Bl/6 mice
injected with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 contain readily detectable levels
of IL-6 and IL-17 but only minimal TGF-h (Fig. 4C). However, in
the absence of IL-6, no IL-17 could be detected in injected prostates and these organs now contained abundant TGF-h, indicative of a much more immunosuppressive tissue microenvironment
(Fig. 4C). These data show that by removing IL-6, the prostate-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

specific IL-6/Th-17 immune response to inflammatory killing of
normal cells was converted into a Treg response.
Prostate autoimmunity correlates closely with tumor
rejection. We are particularly interested in whether the autoimmune response induced by inflammatory killing of normal cells can
be exploited to treat tumors of the same histologic type sharing
common antigens with the tumor (9, 21, 24, 25). TC2 cells are murine
prostatic cancer cells syngeneic to C57Bl/6 mice. Direct intraprostatic injection of control adenoviruses into animals bearing
6 days established TC2 tumors growing s.c. was unable to effect on
the growth of the tumors (Fig. 5A; P > 0.05 for Ad-VSV-G compared
with Ad-hsp70 or Ad-GFP). However, the combination of AdVSV-G+Ad-hsp70 induced a potent tumor rejection response, which
could cure between 50% and 80% of mice depending on the experiment (Fig. 5A; P < 0.001 for Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 compared with
Ad-VSV-G; Ad-hsp70 or Ad-GFP alone). This rejection response was
highly prostate specific because mice treated in the same way with
Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 were unable to reject s.c. B16 melanoma
tumors (Fig. 5A). Moreover, animals that rejected the primary TC2
tumors were also protected against rechallenge with a tumorigenic
dose of TC2 cells 70 days after the initial challenge (data not shown).
Consistent with both the inability to reject nonprostate-derived
tumors and the generation of long term immunologic memory
splenocytes from mice treated with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 contained
cells specific for prostate antigens expressed on TC2 cells (Fig. 5B)
but not for antigens expressed on B16 cells (data not shown). The
tumor rejection response induced by inflammatory killing of normal
prostate was dependent on both CD8+ and CD4+ cells (Fig. 5C, top;
P = 0.001 for control immunoglobulin-treated group compared with
either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell–depleted groups). These results contrast
to those in the melanocyte/melanoma model where CD4+ T cells
were dispensable for therapeutic effects (9, 21, 24, 25) but are
consistent with the role of CD4+ Th17 cells in driving both the
autoimmune and antitumor immune responses that we observe in
this system (38–40). Consistent also with our observation that IL-6 is
a critical mediator of the differentiation of a Th-17 antiprostate
autoimmune response (Fig. 4), TC2 tumors could not be cured by
inflammatory killing of normal prostates in IL-6KO mice (Fig. 5C,
bottom) unlike the result in C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 5A). There was,
however, a small but significant (P < 0.02) prolongation of survival
between groups injected with Ad-GFP and Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70,
suggesting that factors other than just IL-6 may also be important
after hsp70-mediated immune activation in the prostate. This is
consistent also with the observation that splenocytes from IL-6KO
mice, treated with intraprostatic injections of Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70,
secreted IFN-g in response to coculture with TC2 tumor cells (but
not B16 cells) but at greatly reduced levels than was the case for
splenocytes from C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 5D). Finally, IL-17 was
undetectable by RT-PCR and ELISA from lymph nodes draining
the injected prostates in IL-6KO mice, which was not the case for
C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 5D, Fig. 3, and data not shown). These data show
that the inflammatory killing of normal prostate can be exploited as
an antitumor immunotherapy, and that there is a close correlation
between the cytokine mediators of autoimmune responses with
those determining antitumor rejection.

Discussion
We show here that hsp70-mediated IL-6 expression in the prostate acts as an adjuvant to fusogenic cell killing mediated by the
VSV-G glycoprotein to promote differentiation of a Th-17–like

Figure 5. Inflammatory killing of normal prostate induces potent antitumor rejection responses. A, 2  105 B16 or 2  106 prostate TC2 cells were seeded s.c. in
C57BL/6 mice. On day 6, mice under anesthetics were injected intraprostatically with 109 pfu of Ad-GFP or Ad-VSV-G (27–29, 31, 46–50), or Ad-hsp70 or with
5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5  108 pfu Ad-hsp70. After surgery, the mice recovered and survival (tumor, 1.0 cm) after seeding of tumors is shown for all TC2-bearing
adenovirus-treated mice. Mice bearing B16 tumors s.c. treated with Ad-VSV-G+hsp70 intraprostatically are also shown. Results shown are representative of multiple
experiments. B, mice under anesthetics were injected intraprostatically with 109 pfu of Ad-GFP or Ad-VSV-G or Ad-hsp70 or with 5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5  108 pfu
Ad-hsp70. After surgery, the mice recovered. One week later, 500,000 splenocytes per treatment group were harvested and cocultured with 50,000 TC2 or B16
(data not shown) target tumor cells prepulsed with IFN-g to increase levels of MHC class I. Forty-eight hours later, supernatants were harvested and assayed by
ELISA for IFN-g. Cocultures of splenocytes with B16 targets produced no IFN-g over background (data not shown). Results shown are representative of two
different experiments. C, 2  106 prostate TC2 (top ), cells were seeded s.c. in C57BL/6 mice. On day 4, mice received injections of contol IgG, or CD4+ T cell- or
CD8+ T-cell–depleting antibodies (see Materials and Methods). On day 6, mice under anesthetics were injected intraprostatically with 5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5 
108 pfu Ad-hsp70. After surgery, the mice recovered and survival (tumor, 1.0 cm) after seeding of tumors is shown. Results are representative of two different
experiments. Bottom, 2  106 prostate TC2 cells were seeded s.c. in B6.129S2-IL6tm1Kopf /J (IL-6KO) mice. On day 6, mice under anesthetics were injected
intraprostatically with 109 pfu of Ad-GFP or with 5  108 pfu Ad-VSV-G+5  108 pfu Ad-hsp70. After surgery, the mice recovered and survival (tumor, 1.0 cm)
after seeding of tumors is shown. D, when the B6.129S2-IL6tm1Kopf /J (IL-6KO) mice of experiment C above were euthanized due to tumor size, 500,000 splenocytes
per treatment group were harvested and cocultured with 50,000 TC2, or B16 target tumor cells were prepulsed with IFN-g to increase levels of MHC class I. Splenocytes
from a C57Bl/6 mouse injected intraprostatically with Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70 were used as a positive control as shown. Forty-eight hours later, supernatants were
harvested and assayed by ELISA for IFN-g. In addition, lymph nodes draining the injected prostates were recovered and assayed by ELISA for IL-17 (lymph node IL-17).

immune response that is associated with progressive autoimmune
attack of the normal prostate. Both hsp70 and cell killing are
required to produce optimal autoimmune reactivity, although we did
observe moderate autoimmune inflammatory responses with
Ad-VSV-G alone. In contrast, normal cell killing in the presence of
hsp70 expression did not generate detectable Treg responses,
consistent with the presence of both IL-6 and TGF-h in the lymph
nodes draining the injected prostates. In addition, prior depletion of
Treg from mice injected intraprostatically with a known immuno-

genic ova-expressing plasmid had no potentiating effect on the
concomitant T-cell response primed against the ova antigen by
inflammatory killing of normal prostate tissue. The absence of
detectable Treg responses after inflammatory killing of normal
prostate may explain, at least in part, the inability to protect the
normal organ from ongoing autoimmune attack directed against
prostate specific self-antigens. These findings in the prostate
contrast with our earlier findings with the melanocyte/melanoma
model; in those experiments, inflammatory killing of normal

melanocytes (albeit through transfer of the HSVtk and hsp70 genes)
induced a potent Treg response, which restrained the concomitant
CD8+ T-cell–dependent response directed against self-antigens of
melanocytes (and B16 melanomas); moreover, suppression of this
Treg response was required to induce autoimmune manifestations
(24, 25). Only when the potency of the antiself–T-cell response was
augmented by additional costimulation were overt signs of autoimmunity observed (21). It seems likely that the differences in
immunologic outcome between these two models (progressive
autoimmune destruction of the normal prostate versus suppression
of autoimmunity against melanocytes) may result from differences in
the constellation of immune cells residing within different organs
and the receptors that they express for hsp70. In this respect, we are
currently studying the expression of known hsp70 receptors (41–43),
as well as additional costimulatory molecules, on cells which might
be expected to respond to hsp70 (such as antigen presenting cells
and macrophages; refs. 12, 18, 41) from the normal prostate.
These data also suggest that strategies aimed at blockading the
action of key cytokines should be clinically very useful in treatment
of progressive autoimmune disorders—such as IL-6 and IL-17 [or
associated cytokines (IL-23)] in (hsp70) induced prostatitis (as we
observe with IL-6 KO mice). Additionally, these results support a
role for the adoptive transfer of Treg populations to suppress
proautoimmune T-cell responses (44). Indeed, such a strategy has
recently been shown to be effective in treatment of ongoing
autoimmune disease in the pancreas in nonobese diabetic mice
(45). We are currently investigating the possibility of inducing Treg
specific for prostate antigens and their use in nullifying the
progressive autoimmune prostatitis we have reported here.
Finally, the major impetus for these studies was our interest in the
connectivity between the generation of autoimmune responses and
antitumor immunity (24, 25) in tissue types other than the classically
‘‘immunogenic’’ melanoma model (8, 9). Significantly, we have shown
here that the IL-6/IL-17–mediated autoimmune response raised
against normal prostate is also extremely effective at rejecting
established prostate tumors growing elsewhere in the animal. This
response is CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell–dependent and is highly antigen
specific because it did not effect on a tumor of a different histologic
type (Fig. 5A and B). Therefore, normal prostate tissue expresses
antigens that can also serve as targets for tumor rejection responses,
and these responses can be primed through inflammatory killing of
normal prostate cells. The nature of these antigens is currently
unclear; however, our ability to isolate splenocyte populations that
are activated against prostate, but not melanoma, tumor cells offers
an excellent opportunity for us to identify normal prostate antigens
which are shared with prostate tumors and which may serve as

cell killing could be clinically valuable to treat associated cancers.
Because surgical or immunologic prostatectomy is non–life threatening, intentional induction of killing of normal prostates could
provide a valuable immunologic adjuvant approach to the treatment
of metastatic prostate cancer, especially given the potency of the
antitumor effects described in the current study. Direct injection of
the appropriate vectors into the normal prostate, using established
techniques for brachytherapy, could be used either with or without
subsequent surgical prostatectomy to induce priming of protective
antitumor immunity against both the local tumor as well as against
preexisting metastatic disease. Our data here derive from the TC2transplantable tumor cell line injected s.c. In the human clinical situation, tumors are likely to have been established for longer periods and
to have metastasized to different locations than those reflected in our
model. Experiments are currently under way to test the efficacy of
inflammatory killing of the normal prostates of TRAMP transgenic
mice to treat spontaneously arising metastatic prostate cancers,
thereby mimicking more closely treatment of human disease.
The expected toxicity associated with induction of ongoing
prostatitis could be resolved by prostatectomy if necessary. To
address the issue of systemic autoimmune toxicity induced by the
inflammatory killing of normal prostates, a pathology review of
major organs and tissues is currently under way. Although no
abnormalities have been observed at the level of epithelial damage,
or immune infiltrations, of normal organs and tissues in mice 3
weeks after intraprostatic injection of the Ad-VSV-G+Ad-hsp70
vectors, longer term toxicology studies are currently under way to
determine whether any autoimmune manifestations become
apparent at 6 months posttreatment.
In summary, we show here that in the prostate, hsp70 induces
IL-6, which triggers a CD4- and CD8-dependent progressive
autoimmune reactivity, associated with IL-17 expression and no
significant Treg response. These data are significant in that they
confirm that the intimate connectivity between autoimmune and
antitumor rejection responses extends beyond the classic melanoma paradigm and may be clinically valuable for the treatment of
established metastatic prostate cancer.
