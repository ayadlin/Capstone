Abstract
Most cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identiﬁed using genome-wide association
studies are located outside of protein-coding regions, and their signiﬁcance and mode of action have been a
source of continuing debate. One proposed mechanism of action of the SNPs is that they would affect the
activity of enhancer elements regulating critical target genes. In this review, we summarize recent results that
substantiate this model. These studies have identiﬁed a cancer-speciﬁc enhancer element at the 8q24 gene
desert that controls the expression of the MYC oncogene. We further discuss implications of the observed
difference between normal growth control and cancer for drug development, and the inherent features of
genome-wide association studies that may speciﬁcally lead to identiﬁcation of disease-speciﬁc regulatory
elements. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4180–4. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed
more than 150 loci associated with increased susceptibility to
cancer, according to the Catalog of Published Genome-wide
Association Studies (http:/www.genome.gov/gwastudies/ or
ref. 1 for review). The susceptibility alleles identiﬁed by GWAS
are generally common (minor allele frequency >10%) and
confer small risks (OR < 1.5). Most of the susceptibility regions
are located outside of known protein-coding sequences, and
often it is hard to associate a single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) to a particular gene. In most cases, it is thought that the
GWAS-identiﬁed SNPs do not themselves affect disease risk,
but merely identify a region where a causative variant is
located.
The genomic region on 8q24 is one of the most interesting
regions pinpointed by GWAS because it harbors multiple risk
loci for cancer (Fig. 1). For example, multiple independent risk
loci for prostate cancer are located at 8q24 (2–6), and predisposition alleles to several other epithelial cancers are also
found in distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks within this
region. An intriguing aspect of the risk alleles is that they are
located in a 1.2-Mb "gene desert" region. This region is part of a
single chromatin topologic domain (Fig. 1; ref. 7) that contains
the MYC gene. Because MYC is overexpressed in many tumors,
it serves as the most likely candidate target gene.

Although the effects of most polymorphisms at 8q24 are
small, they are among the strongest SNPs identiﬁed in cancer
GWAS. Furthermore, some SNPs have a very high allele frequency, such that they account for a large number of cancer
cases at the population level. For example, the polymorphism
rs6983267 linked to colorectal cancer (CRC; ref. 8) and prostate
cancer (6) contributes more to cancer morbidity and mortality
than any other known inherited variant or mutation, including
the classic high-penetrance tumor suppressors such as RB,
TP53, and APC.

Role of GWAS SNPs in Gene Regulation
How can the SNPs located far from any oncogene or tumor
suppressor alter cancer susceptibility? A possible mechanism
of action is thought to be via the inﬂuence of these SNPs on
distal enhancer elements that regulate the expression of critical target genes (9–12). Evidence exists for regulatory activity
of SNPs located in several regions, including 8q24, 8q21, and
17q24 (13, 14).
Several lines of evidence have suggested that the CRC
predisposition SNP rs6983267 functions in such a way. We
and others (9, 10) found earlier that rs6983267 resides in a
binding site for T-cell factor 4 (TCF4; HUGO name TCF7L2), a
crucial downstream effector of the Wnt signaling pathway. The
SNP is located within a computationally predicted enhancer
element MYC-335 (10). The MYC-335 element was subsequently shown to possess enhancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. It
also carries histone mark H3K4me1 characteristic of enhancers, and the region containing rs6983267 physically interacts
with the MYC promoter in CRC cell lines (9). Most importantly,
the risk allele G creates a stronger binding site for TCF7L2
compared with the nonrisk allele T, thus providing a plausible
mechanism by which this SNP affects cancer susceptibility
(10). It is currently not known to what fraction of the GWAS
SNPs function in this way. However, statistical enrichment
analyses that indicate that GWAS-identiﬁed regions are

Figure 1. Multiple cancer predisposition alleles at the 8q24 gene desert. Multiple GWAS-identiﬁed risk-loci for cancer (colored boxes) are located within a single
chromatin topologic domain (top) on chromosome 8, bordered by the MYC gene (bottom). The region contains ﬁve distinct prostate cancer (PrCa) risk
loci and one loci for breast cancer (BrCa), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), colorectal cancer (CRC), and bladder cancer (BlCa) that are found in
distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks (HapMap LD). Top, normalized Hi–C interaction frequency displayed as a two-dimensional heat map (7) showing

diagonal intersection. Black rectangles mark the boundaries. Bottom, linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the risk region is shown with the genomic
coordinates and gene annotations (HG18). Arrows mark the cancer-risk SNPs identiﬁed in the region.

enriched in expression quantitative trait loci (11, 15) and
DNase I hypersensitive sites (12) suggest that considerable
number of GWAS SNPs may act through a similar mechanism.

Reverse Genetic Analysis of 8q24 in the Mouse
The MYC-335 element is highly conserved in mammalian
species, and so is the gene order in this region, with the
exception of the POU5F1 pseudogene that is only present in
humans. The binding of TCF7L2 to the site affected by rs6983267
is also conserved (16) at least in mice, which carry the risk allele.
This made it possible to analyze the role of MYC-335 in cancer
and MYC expression using a mouse model. We thus generated a
knockout mouse in which the Myc-335 region was deleted.
Consistent with the predicted role of MYC-335 in tissue-speciﬁc
regulation of MYC, we observed a modest decrease in Myc
expression in the colon of newborn mice. The mice were viable

www.aacrjournals.org

and fertile and developed normally under laboratory conditions.
However, when challenged with the Apcmin mutation that
confers strong, TCF7L2-dependent intestinal tumor predisposition, the mice showed a remarkable reduction in the frequency
of intestinal tumor development (16).
These results have several important implications: (i) regulatory elements affected by SNPs can be much more important for tumorigenesis than suggested by the small effect of
the SNP itself, (ii) normal growth and pathologic growth use
different regulatory mechanisms, and (iii) GWASs are specifically biased to identify such disease-speciﬁc variants.

Even SNPs with Weak Effects Can Identify
Central Mechanisms of Cancer
The weak effect of most SNPs identiﬁed in GWAS has elicited
a lot of criticism of the methodology. The effects seen are

Sur et al.

mostly so weak that their relevance to disease prediction and
prevention is limited.
However, the SNPs can mark a region that is very important
in cancer; they may for instance identify a region containing
a causative mutation that is more rare and has higher
penetrance. High-throughput whole-genome sequencing techniques have already identiﬁed one such SNP in 8q24,
rs188140481, that confers relatively high risk (OR ¼ 2.90) for
prostate cancer (17). Such SNPs are more important for disease
prediction and prevention, and more relevant for cancer
screening. In addition, the SNPs may interact with each other
epistatically to yield higher risk. Given that only approximately
5% of familial risk in most cancers can be attributed to
common SNPs, such interactions between SNPs are a potential
source of the "missing" familial risk (18).
In addition, even a weak SNP can pinpoint a regulatory
element whose activity is critical for tumorigenesis. This is
because it is possible that the weak SNP is weak simply because
it only weakly affects the regulatory element in which it resides.
Thus, such SNPs could act in an analogous way to a weak
missense mutation in the coding region of an essential gene.
The analysis of the effects of Myc-335 loss clearly shows that
even though a SNP may lead to only a modest increase in risk,
the element in which it resides can have a much stronger effect
on disease.
Taken together, in the mechanistic sense, cancer-associated SNPs should be thought of as markers that have identiﬁed
regions whose role in cancer can be very important or critical.
As discussed below, many of the regions identiﬁed may also
be cancer speciﬁc. Thus, further mechanistic studies of
cancer susceptibility regions pinpointed by GWAS are clearly
warranted.

GWAS Speciﬁcally Identify Disease-Speciﬁc
Mechanisms
The importance of gene regulation in cancer is highlighted
by the identiﬁcation of several novel noncoding regions linked
to cancer in GWAS. Although the number of novel ﬁndings
coming from GWAS may appear large, the cancer-associated
regions are expected to represent only a small fraction of the
large number of regulatory elements in our genome identiﬁed
by the ENCODE project (19).
Furthermore, our identiﬁcation of a regulatory element that
is not required for normal development, but is important for
cancer, is not as surprising as one might initially think. In fact,
GWAS may be speciﬁcally biased toward identiﬁcation of such
disease-speciﬁc functions. In a GWAS, SNPs that have a high
allele frequency will more likely be identiﬁed with a low P
value. However, high allele frequency indicates small effect on
ﬁtness, as any SNP that has a strong ﬁtness effect would be
relatively rapidly ﬁxed in the population (20). Thus, identifying
disease-linked SNPs using GWAS is biased toward ﬁnding
regulatory elements that have a small effect on ﬁtness and
viability but a relatively large effect on the disease analyzed.
Thus, investigating mechanisms of cancer-associated SNPs
may yield promising new drug targets that are not required
for viability, but could be targeted for therapy.

Normal Functions of the Regulatory Elements at
8q24
The high prevalence of the risk allele G of rs6983267, and the
presence of additional SNPs predicted to increase MYC-335
activity (21) in the African-American population, suggests that
increased activity of MYC-335 may provide a small ﬁtness
advantage at least in some populations. A biologic role for the
gene desert at 8q24 is also suggested by the observation that
several regions within it show high sequence conservation
between species.
Given the conservation of elements within the 8q24 gene
desert in mammals, it seems that this region does have a
normal function. But what is it? Several lines of evidence
suggest that elements other than MYC-335 also function in
tissue-speciﬁc gene regulation. A comprehensive epigenetic
mapping analysis has identiﬁed several enhancer elements
within the risk loci that show tissue-speciﬁc activity both
in vitro and in vivo (22, 23). Apart from the rs6983267, another
regulatory SNP has been identiﬁed in the enhancers, namely
rs11986220, which is strongly correlated with prostate cancer
predisposition SNP rs10090154 (2). It affects a FoxA1 binding
site within an androgen-responsive enhancer at PrCa-1 region
(22). Furthermore, the enhancer elements at 8q24 are coupled
to MYC via long-range interactions in a tissue-speciﬁc manner.
Ahmadiyeh and colleagues (24) showed that the breast cancer
risk locus interacts with MYC in the breast cancer line MCF7,
but not in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. None of the risk
loci interacted with MYC in a ﬁbroblast cell line (24). Thus,
although MYC is expressed in several tissues, distinct distal
enhancers upstream of MYC could regulate its expression in
speciﬁc tissues and different cancer types.
This still leaves a larger question: Why does all this regulation exist in the ﬁrst place? As Myc is not required in the adult
for most normal proliferation (25–29), it is likely that the
biologic role of Myc and the 8q24 risk region has more to do
with tissue repair and/or other responses that require temporary increase in cellular proliferation rate.

Difference between Growth Control in Normal
Tissues and in Cancer
The MYC gene is important for the development and proliferation of multiple types of cancers. Overexpression or
deregulated expression of Myc in transgenic animal models
causes unrestrained growth resulting in tumors in several
tissues (30–33). Myc is also required for growth of normal cells
in culture, and cells lacking Myc grow very slowly. The only
identiﬁed gene that can rescue the slow growth phenotype of
rat embryonic ﬁbroblasts lacking Myc is Myc or its paralog NMyc (34), and targeting MYC in cultured cells generally leads to
growth arrest. However, at least in mice, Myc is dispensable for
development until E11.5 with the exception of the hematopoietic lineage (27). Furthermore, although Myc is expressed in the
proliferating compartment of several adult tissues, the postnatal deletion of Myc in mice does not result in prominent
proliferation defects (25, 26, 28, 29). These results suggest that
MYC is more important for growth of tumors and cultured cells
than growth and homeostasis of normal tissues. Thus, growth

Role of Cancer SNPs Identiﬁed by GWAS

in cultured cells and cancer on one hand, and normal tissues on
the other, seems to be controlled through different mechanisms. Our results have identiﬁed a molecular mechanism
behind this difference. Myc-335 seems to be speciﬁcally
required for tumorigenesis but not for normal growth control.
It is possible that cancer and adult tissue repair share
mechanisms, whereas normal growth and proliferation might
use a different mechanism. The connection between wound
repair and cancer has long been suspected, and tumors are
proposed to be wounds that do not heal (35). Cultured cells are
usually exposed to serum proteins that are normally only
present in healing wounds. If cancer cells in vivo and cultured
cells in vitro share growth mechanisms that are not used by
normal cells in vivo, this has profound implications for cancer
drug development. Using cultured cells to assess growth effects
or toxicity can result in rejection of lead compounds that
speciﬁcally target tumors over normal tissues. Thus, cancerspeciﬁc compounds should be tested for their effects on
normal cells in vivo, or using tissue culture conditions where
the growth mechanisms of cells resemble normal tissues rather
than healing wounds.

Targeting MYC
MYC is a very attractive cancer treatment target, given that it
is upregulated in many cancer types and is critical for tumor
growth. Compounds targeting MYC might thus be used in a
much broader set of patients than the current mechanismbased cancer drugs. It might also be more difﬁcult for a cancer
to escape MYC loss, as no other genes except N-MYC and L-MYC
are known that can compensate for its activity.
However, MYC is a hard-to-drug transcription factor that
lacks small molecule binding pockets. Thus, it might be easier
to target upstream or downstream effectors of MYC activation
than c-MYC per se. Many current mechanism-based drugs act
far upstream of MYC by targeting signaling pathways that drive
expression of c-MYC or N-MYC (see, e.g., ref. 36). Genetic
evidence in mouse models shows that targeting proteins that
act downstream of Myc, for example via ribosomal haploinsufﬁciency or by targeting ornithine decarboxylase, is a successful strategy without signiﬁcant adverse effects (37, 38). In
addition, targeting a speciﬁc function of MYC itself, for
instance, by expressing the dominant negative form of Myc
(Omomyc) also results in an efﬁcient and safe treatment in
transgenic mouse cancer models (39). Our results imply that
there might be an alternative way to generate the speciﬁcity in
targeting MYC for cancer chemoprevention or therapy. It is
feasible that in the future one could inhibit upstream mechanisms that control MYC-335 activity, for instance by targeting
the mechanisms that regulate the activity of the transcription
factors that control MYC-335 activity. If we can target a novel
disease-speciﬁc enhancer without affecting normal function, it

would provide a major advancement in our ability to target
critical cancer genes without major side effects to the patients.

Perspective
Given that <6 million SNPs exist with allele frequency of >5%,
the GWAS screens have not been saturating in the forward
genetic sense. Thus, the fact that GWAS has not identiﬁed a risk
SNP near a gene does not mean that gene has no role in cancer.
However, the large number of novel cancer-associated loci
identiﬁed by GWAS has provided a very rich resource for
identiﬁcation of novel mechanisms of cancer. The recent
functional analysis of 8q24 variants has already uncovered a
new complexity in regulation of a classic oncogene, MYC.
Expansion of such functional analyses to genome-wide scale,
using methods such as high-throughput ChIP-seq, chromatin
conformation capture (3C), and genome editing using TALENs
and/or CRISPRs will be required to make full use of the
obtained genetic data.
Much work also remains before we understand the full
implications of the mechanistic ﬁndings and can translate
them to medical beneﬁts. Open questions include the following: (i) What is the normal function of the gene desert at 8q24?
(ii) Are all of the GWAS SNPs at 8q24 linked to SNPs or
structural variants affecting MYC? (iii) Do SNPs at other loci
act via similar mechanisms, (iv) Is MYC-335 activity still
required in cancer cells? (v) Can we target it or upstream
pathways that drive its activity? One thing is clear. Once again,
several new and exciting lines of research have been opened by
unbiased genetic analyses of cancer. And again, their value to
patients will depend on the mechanistic studies to follow.
