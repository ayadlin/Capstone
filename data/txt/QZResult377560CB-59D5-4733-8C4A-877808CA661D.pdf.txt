ABSTRACT
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to breast
cancer progression by releasing soluble factors that sustain tumor progression. MSCs
express functional epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and breast cancer cells
secrete EGFR-ligands including transforming growth factor-α (TGFα). Using RNAsequencing, we analysed the whole transcriptome of MSCs stimulated with TGFα. We
identified 1,640 highly differentially regulated genes: 967 genes up-regulated with
Fold Induction (FI)≥1.50 and 673 genes down-regulated with FI≤0.50. When highly
regulated genes were categorized according to GO molecular function classification
and KEGG pathways analysis, a large number of genes coding for potentially
secreted proteins or surface receptors resulted enriched following TGFα treatment,
including VEGFA, IL6, EREG, HB-EGF, LIF, NGF, NRG1, CCL19, CCL2, CCL25 and CXCL3.
Secretion of corresponding proteins was confirmed for selected factors. Finally, we
identified 4,377 and 4,262 alternatively spliced genes in untreated and TGFα-treated
MSCs, respectively. Among these, an unannotated splice variant of VEGFA coding
for a secreted VEGF protein of 172 aminoacids (VEGFA172), was found only in MSCs
stimulated with TGFα. These findings suggest that EGFR activation in MSCs leads to
a significant change in the expression of a wide array of genes coding for secreted
proteins that can significantly enhance tumor progression.

factors produced by MSCs, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGF) and IL6, may cooperate in
promoting breast cancer cell migration [6].
Despite a number of MSCs-secreted factors have
been demonstrated to be involved in the cross-talk
between MSCs and breast cancer cells, little information
is available on the factors released by breast cancer cells
that might regulate the secretome of MSCs.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors
bind and activate the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase
receptors that comprises four distinct members, EGFR,
ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 [7, 8]. Following ligand
binding, the ErbB receptors form homo- or h
­eterodimers with subsequent phosphorylation of the tyrosine
kinase domain and activation of different signalling
pathways, including the RAS/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/

INTRODUCTION
Several studies demonstrated that bone marrowderived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to
breast cancer progression [1]. In particular, MSCs secrete
a number of growth factors, chemokines and cytokines that
sustain breast cancer cell proliferation, survival and invasion
and that are able to modulate functions of the tumor
microenvironment essential for tumor growth including
angiogenesis. In this respect, the chemokine (C-C motif)
ligand 5 (CCL5/RANTES), the monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), interleukin 17B (IL17B) and the
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) are known
to be involved in the cross-talk between MSCs and breast
cancer cells and to favour the development of metastases
[2–5]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that different

AKT pathways [9]. EGF-like peptides are abundantly
produced and secreted by human breast cancer cells
[10]. Transforming growth factor α (TGFα) is one of the
most potent ligands of the EGFR [10]. While EGF forms
an EGF/EGFR complex that is degraded in lysosomes,
the TGFα/EGFR complex favours the recycling of the
receptor, thus resulting in a more potent mitogenic signal
and a greater DNA synthesis compared to EGF [11, 12].
High levels of expression of TGFα have been reported in
several tumor types, including breast cancer [7, 13].
Because several studies demonstrated that MSCs
express a functional EGFR [14–16], we hypothesized that
TGFα might be involved in the cross-talk between MSCs
and breast cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment
[17]. Previous studies, including observations from our
group, have indeed demonstrated that treatment with
TGFα or EGF increased in MSCs the production of
several factors which might promote tumor growth and/
or angiogenesis, such as VEGF, IL6, angiopoietin-2
(ANG-2), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and heparin-binding EGF
(HB-EGF) [15, 18, 19]. However, these studies did not
provide a comprehensive picture of the effects of EGFR
signalling on the secretome of MSCs.
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), using next-generationsequencing (NGS) platforms, has greatly improved the
analysis of whole transcriptome, allowing for the complete
annotation and quantification of a large number genes in
a single run. This technology allows to detect known and
uncharacterized transcripts, and provides information on
alternative and novel splicing events [20].
Using the RNA-Seq technology, we analysed the
whole transcriptome of MSCs stimulated with TGFα in
order to comprehensively assess the genes regulated by the
EGFR signalling in MSCs. We identified a panel of growth
factors, cytokines and chemokines potentially involved in
the EGFR-mediated cross-talk between MSCs and breast
cancer cells. These findings have increased our knowledge

on the mechanisms of breast cancer progression and might
allow to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting the
tumor-stroma interaction.

RESULTS
RNA-seq analysis
In order to characterize the whole transcriptome
of MSCs following EGFR activation, we stimulated
serum-starved MSCs with recombinant TGFα (10 ng/
ml) for 1 hour and purified poly(A) RNA fractions from
not stimulated (MSC) or TGFα-stimulated (MSC+TGFα)
MSCs. Using the SOLiD 5500xl platform, we sequenced
four libraries of cDNA from MSCs and four from
MSC+TGFα, and an average number of reads of about
37 million for MSC and 47 million for MSC+TGFα
was obtained (Supplementary table 1). Quality analysis
revealed that more than 50% of sequences had a median
quality score value of 31. Sequence reads were aligned to
the human genome hg19, using the LifeScope software.
The mapping of the sequence reads to the reference
genome evidenced a mean coverage of 80% for MSC and
77% for MSC+TGFα (Supplementary table 1).
The analysis of the mean distribution of the reads
onto the reference genome indicated that the majority of
the reads fell onto exons (92%), while only a minority
of the reads fell onto introns (4%) or intergenic regions
(4%) (Figure 1A). The presence of some intronic reads
in total poly(A) RNA might be due to partially processed
RNAs and/or to currently unannotated internal exons [21].
To compare gene expression levels within and between
replicates, Reads Per Kilobase per Million of mapped
reads (RPKM) values for each gene were calculated [21].
RPKM values obtained in the four replicates of
untreated and TGFα-treated MSCs resulted to be highly
reproducible, as demonstrated by statistical analysis
(ANOVA test, P-value>0.999) (Figure 1B).

superfamily (NGF, CD70, TNFSF13B, TNFSF4 and
TNFSF9); EGF-like proteins (HB-EGF, EREG and NRG1)
and their receptors (ERBB3); and other growth factors
(LIF and KITLG/SCF). Enriched categories also included
several chemokines (CCL19, CCL2, CCL25 and CXCL3),
interleukins (IL6, IL15, IL17B, IL19 and IL1B) and
interleukin receptors (IL12RB2, IL18R1, IL20RA, IL9R,
IL1R2, IL12RB1, IL2RB and IL7R). Moreover, EGFR
activation in MSCs produced a significant enrichment
in genes belonging to the TGFβ superfamily (BMP3,
INHBA, INHBC, INHBE, MSTN, GDF15 and TGFB3),
that plays a role in cell migration, invasion and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT).
Transcripts coding for proteins associated
with cellular motility and cell-cell adhesion, such as
cytokeratins (KRT14, KRT17, KRT18, KRT24, KRT32,
KRT34 and KRT15), tubulins (TUBA3E, TUBB2A,
TUBB2C, TUBB3, TUBB4Q and TUBG1) and claudins
(CLDN2, CLDN20, CLDN4 and CLDN5), also resulted
to be enriched in MSCs following treatment with TGFα.
Finally, EGFR activation modulated the expression
of genes coding for regulators of cell cycle (CCNE2,
CDK5RI and CDKN1A) and of cell signalling (ERBB3,
SOCS3, TRIB1 and AGAP2).
Within GO enriched categories we found both upregulated and down-regulated genes (Table 1). In this
respect, we found that a large number of genes coding
for potentially secreted proteins resulted up-regulated
following TGFα treatment (n. 47), whereas 19 genes were
down-regulated. Among the up-regulated genes, we found
several genes that have been already shown to have a role
in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and to be potentially
involved in the interaction between MSCs and breast
cancer cells, including VEGFA, IL6, EREG, HB-EGF, LIF,
NGF, NRG1, CCL19, CCL2, CCL25 and CXCL3 (Table 1).
To evaluate the enrichment in signalling pathways,
we performed KEGG analysis on the 1,640 highly

We next calculated false discovery rate (FDR) and
false negative rate (FNR) for different RPKM values
and identified a RPKM threshold value of 0.013, that
balanced the number of false negatives and false positives
(Figure  2A). Applying this threshold, we identified
19,669 genes expressed in MSCs. We then selected
10,068 genes that are differentially expressed between
untreated and TGFα-treated MSCs at P-value = 0.05
corrected with 0.1 FDR, according to the statistical
analysis performed with the R-based package DESeq [22]
(Figure 2B and Supplementary table 2).
For the 10,068 genes, we calculated the differential
gene expression as Fold Induction (FI). We focused
our attention on 1,640 genes that we considered highly
differentially regulated. In particular, 967 genes were
up-regulated with FI≥1.50 and 673 genes were downregulated with FI≤0.50 (Supplementary table 3).

Functional enrichment analysis of highly
regulated genes
To investigate the biological role of the genes
modulated in MSCs at transcriptional level following
EGFR activation, we categorized the 1,640 highly
regulated genes (FI≤0.50 and FI≥1.50) into enriched
categories according to GO molecular function
classification and KEGG pathways analysis.
The top 6 GO categories that resulted significantly
enriched with a P value <0.01 were: growth factor
activity; cytokine activity; protein kinase regulator
activity; structural molecule activity; cytokine receptor
activity; and kinase regulator activity. The complete list
of genes included in each category has been reported in
Table 1. TGFα-treated MSCs resulted to be enriched in
genes coding for members of different families of growth
factors: VEGF (VEGFA and FIGF/VEGFD); fibroblast
growth factor (FGF10 and FGF17); TNF ligands

The list of genes included in this analysis significantly
overlapped with the list of the enriched GO categories,
with particular regard to secreted proteins and cell
membrane receptors. Importantly, TGFα stimulation also
produced in MSCs a significant up-regulation of genes
that are known to be induced by EGFR activation, such as
the transcription factors FOS, JUN, JUND and ELK4, and
different inhibitors of MAPK kinase activity belonging to
Sprouty (SPRY2 and SPRY4) and DUSP (DUSP1, DUSP2,

of MSCs for 96 hours with TGFα leads to a significant
increase in the secretion of both VEGF and IL6 [15]. In
order to evaluate the effects of a brief exposure to TGFα
on the secretion of these factors in MSCs, we performed
time course experiments using the xMAP Bio-Plex
Cytokine array system. Time course analysis revealed that
TGFα induced in MSCs the release of VEGF and IL6 as
early as 2 to 8 hours after the start of treatment (Figure 3A
and 3B).
We next investigated whether transcriptional
regulation of additional secreted factors also resulted in
an increased protein release in MSCs following TGFα
treatment. For this purpose, we measured the levels of
HB-EGF, LIF, NGF and CCL2 in the conditioned media
from untreated or TGFα-treated MSCs at different time
points. Accordingly with RNA-seq data demonstrating that
treatment of MSCs with TGFα induced the transcription
of HB-EGF (FI=5.60), LIF (FI=9.01), NGF (FI=1.63) and
CCL2 (FI=1.88) (Supplementary table 3), we observed an
increase of the secretion of the corresponding proteins,
although at different extent and with different kinetic
(Figure 3). In particular, the secretion of HB-EGF, LIF
and NGF gradually increased following treatment with
TGFα (Figure 3C-E). Only a modest raise in the levels
of CCL2 was observed in TGFα-treated MSCs at 2 and
8 hours followed by a mild reduction at the later time
points (Figure 3F).

Taken together, these data confirm that TGFα
stimulation induces in MSCs an early and prolonged
secretion of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines that
are modulated at transcriptional level.

Expression of alternative splicing variants of
VEGFA in MSCs
Alternative splicing significantly increases
functional gene diversity, and aberrant splicing has
been shown to contribute to tumor progression and
cancer therapy resistance [23]. To evaluate whether
EGFR activation regulated in MSCs the expression
of alternatively spliced genes, the RNA-seq data were
analysed using the Splice Finding tool. Among the 19,669
genes expressed in MSCs, we identified 4,377 and 4,262
alternatively spliced genes in untreated and TGFα-treated
MSCs, respectively. We focused our attention on selected
genes coding for secreted factors listed in tables 1 and 2.
For all the investigated genes we found only one mature
transcript, except for VEGFA, GDNF, NRG1 and OGN
(data not shown).
In particular, VEGFA showed 6 different splice
isoforms that differed for the presence or absence of the
exons 6a, 6b and 7b (Figure 4). Five variants encoded for
the already characterized isoforms VEGFA165, VEGFA148,
VEGFA121, VEGFA206 and VEGFA183. The other isoform

and VEGFA183 isoforms the translation ends at the first stop codon (TGA1). For VEGFA148, and putatively for VEGFA172, a premature stop
codon is formed by the out of frame fusion of exons 7a and 8a, resulting in a truncated protein. Dashed lines identify 3’untraslated regions.

was an unannotated splice variant of VEGFA of 3,575 bp.
This variant derived from alternative 5’ splice site selection
in the exons 6 and 7, resulting in the lack of the exons 6b
and 7b (Figure 4). Using the Translate tool, we predicted
that the novel splice variant encoded for a protein of
198 aa including the N-terminal signal peptide of 26 aa,
that we named VEGFA172. Compared to VEGFA206, the
predicted VEGFA172 lacked 17 aa encoded by exon 6b, and
17 aa at the C terminal of the protein. The fusion between
7a and 8a resulted in the substitution of an alanine by a
methionine and in a premature stop codon, similarly to
the VEGFA148 isoform (Supplementary figure 1). BLAST
analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences revealed
that the novel isoform does not match with any sequence
in the respective databases. We identified the VEGFA165,

VEGFA148, VEGFA121 and VEGFA206 transcripts both in
untreated and TGFα-treated MSCs, whereas the VEGFA183
and VEGFA172 variants were found only in MSCs stimu­
lated with TGFα, thus suggesting that TGFα affects quality
and quantity of VEGF transcription.
To confirm the expression of the VEGFA172 variant
in TGFα-treated MSCs, we performed RT-PCR analysis
using a forward PCR primer located on exon 6a and a
reverse PCR primer spanning exons 7a/8 boundaries
(Figure 5A). Agarose gel electrophoresis and fragment
analysis of the PCR product confirmed the expression of
the VEGFA172 transcript in TGFα-treated MSCs (Figure 5B
and 5C). The sequence of the new VEGF splice isoform
was also verified by direct sequencing of the PCR product
(data not shown).

DISCUSSION

in MSCs the expression of the angiogenic factors VEGFA
and IL6 that, in agreement with our previous findings,
was also confirmed at protein level. In this regard,
we have previously described that TGFα treatment
of MSC for 96 hours also induced an increase in the
secretion of other pro-angiogenic factors such as IL8,
leptin and PECAM1 [15]. As shown in Supplementary
table 3, PECAM1 gene expression was significantly
up-regulated (FI=2.32) following treatment of MSCs
with TGFα for 1 hour. In contrast, a marginal although
statistically significant increase in the expression of IL8
(FI=1.18) and LEP (the leptin gene, FI=1.28) was found
(Supplementary table 2). These latter findings might
indicate that prolonged stimulation with TGFα or posttranscriptional mechanisms are required for IL8 and
leptin EGFR-induced secretion [15].
Among the cytokines and chemokines, we
found that TGFα significantly modulated LIF that has
been demonstrated to be associated to breast cancer
transformation and progression [27, 28]. We also found
a marginal increase in the levels of secretion of CCL2,
which has been shown to stimulate the migration of breast
cancer cells [3]. Furthermore, TGFα induced in MSCs a
significant increase in the expression of growth factors
such as NGF and HB-EGF that was confirmed at protein
level as well. NGF has been reported to promote breast
cancer cell proliferation and invasion [29]. Intriguingly,
a recent study demonstrated that EGF induced in MSCs
an autocrine loop mediated by EGR1 and involving the
EGFR ligands HB-EGF and AREG. This autocrine circuit
was found to stimulate the secretion by MSCs of other
growth factors and cytokines, including VEGF, LIF, IL6
and IL11 [19]. In agreement with these data, we found
in our study a significant increase in the expression
of HB-EGF, VEGF, IL6, LIF and EGR1 (FI=3.82;
Supplementary table 3) in TGFα-treated MSCs as
compared with untreated cells. We also demonstrated that
EGFR stimulation up-regulated in MSCs the expression

Using RNA-seq, we provided for the first time
a comprehensive assessment of the genes regulated in
MSCs by EGFR signalling. A previous study evaluated
the gene expression profile of epithelial MCF10A and
HeLa cell lines stimulated with EGF for 1 hour using a
microarray approach [24]. Even though different technical
approaches (microarray versus RNAseq), growth factors
(EGF versus TGFα) and cell types (epithelial versus
mesenchymal) have been used, 271 and 134 genes induced
by EGF, respectively, in HeLa and MCF10A cells resulted
differentially expressed also in MSCs following TGFα
stimulation. In particular, EGFR activation induced both
in epithelial cells and in MSCs the up-regulation of the
immediate early response transcription factors JUN,
FOS and EGR1, and of several negative regulators of
transcription such as FOSL1, JUNB, KLF6 and MAFF,
that are delayed response genes implicated in negative
transcriptional regulation of the immediately early
response genes [24]. Finally, genes coding for ZFP36,
that has been described to induce mRNA degradation, and
for DUSP proteins (DUSP4,DUSP6), that dephosphorylate
MAPK, were up-regulated both in MSCs and in epithelial
cells, following EGFR activation [24, 25]. In agreement
with data from Amit and colleagues, our results strongly
confirm that the EGFR was activated in response to TGFα
in MSCs and revealed that a significant number of genes
involved in EGFR signalling regulation are in common
between epithelial cells and MSCs.
Our data demonstrate that EGFR signalling
produces significant modifications in the secretome
of MSCs. Indeed, GO and KEGG analyses showed
that TGFα produced in MSCs a significant enrichment
in genes coding for growth factors, cytokines and
chemokines and in pathways associated with growth
factors and cytokines, such as MAPK and Jak-STAT
pathways [9, 26]. In particular, TGFα treatment induced

of different members of the TGFβ superfamily. Because
it has been demonstrated that TGFβ secreted by cancerassociated fibroblasts promotes EMT in breast cancer
cells [30] as well as in other tumor types and EMT has
a fundamental role in the metastatic spreading, MSCderived TGFβ-like factors might play an important role
in cancer progression. Finally, it must be underlined that
TGFα was also found to induce the expression of several
receptors of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines
including ERBB3 (FI=1.54; Supplementary table 3),
which might enhance the above mentioned autocrine loop
by forming heterodimers with the EGFR. Taken together,
these data suggest that EGFR activation induces a cascade
of events leading to an increase of the ability of MSCs
to both release factors favouring tumor progression and
respond to signals involved in the cross-talk with cancer
cells within the tumor microenvironment.
RNA-seq offers the possibility of identifying
unknown transcripts [20, 31, 32]. In this regard, we
found that in MSCs several genes coding for secreted
proteins have alternatively spliced variants, including
VEGFA, NRG1, GDNF and OGN. Importantly, we also
demonstrated that TGFα-treated MSCs express a novel
splice variant of VEGF. The VEGF gene encodes for
different isoforms with distinct biological properties,
generated by skipping of exon 5 and alternative splice site
selection of exons 6, 7 and 8. VEGF isoforms differ in their
heparin binding ability as well as in receptor affinity [33].
The novel isoform that we identified lacks exons 6b and
7b and potentially codes for a protein of 198 aa. Since
exons 6 and 7 encode for the heparin binding domain of
VEGF, we hypothesize that in the predicted VEGFA172
isoform the heparin binding affinity could be affected.
VEGF binds to two receptors, vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 and -2, and two co-receptors,
neuropilin (NRP)-1 and 2. It has been suggested that exons
7 and 8a are required for binding to NRP-1, while exon
6 and 8a sequences cooperate in NRP-2 binding [34].
VEGFA172 lacks 17 residues encoded by exon 6b, and 17
residues at the C terminal of the protein corresponding to
exons 7b and 8a. Preliminary structural analysis suggest
that VEGFA172 might not be able to bind to NRP-1 but
should interact with NRP-2. However, further structural
and functional studies will be necessary to confirm this
hypothesis. The biological role of the different isoforms
is not fully clarified. The selection of the proximal splice
site in exon 8a results in the generation of pro-angiogenic
forms of VEGF, whereas the selection of the distal splice
site in exon 8b produces anti-angiogenic forms of VEGF,
so that the balance of the different isoforms can either
promote or inhibit angiogenesis [35]. Interestingly, we
identified in MSCs different pro-angiogenic isoforms of
VEGFA, but not anti-angiogenic variants. In this regard,
as the distal splice site in exon 8b has been selected in
VEGFA172 transcript, the resulting protein could also

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

probably belong to the pro-angiogenic family of VEGF
isoforms. It is possible that different pro-angiogenic
isoforms have a different biological activity. For example,
VEGFA121 has been reported to have a stronger angiogenic
activity than VEGFA165 in breast cancer [36]. On the
other hand, lack of binding to NRP-1 might reduce the
angiogenic power of VEGFA172 [35]. Future investigations
on the functional activity of the new VEGF isoform are
ultimately required.
Our findings might have potential clinical
implications. Although the EGFR and its ligands are
frequently expressed in breast carcinoma, anti-EGFR
agents, such as cetuximab, panitumumab, gefitinib
and erlotinib, have produced disappointing results in
breast cancer [37]. Our results might suggest that EGFR
signalling induces within the tumor microenvironment
the release by MSCs of soluble factors that might sustain
breast cancer cell growth through different signalling
pathways that may also be responsible of resistance to antiEGFR agents. Interestingly, the factors whose secretion
was found to be strongly induced in MSCs following
TGFα stimulation, mainly signal through the MAPK and
Jak-STAT pathways. Different STAT3 and Jak inhibitors
are currently in clinical trials and several agents targeting
the MAPK signalling pathway have been tested clinically
or are currently undergoing clinical trial evaluation
[38, 39]. Because it has been recently highlighted the
importance of targeting different mechanisms in the tumor
microenvironment using combination of drugs [40], we
can speculate that anti-EGFR drugs in combination with
anti-MAPK signalling agents or Jak-STAT inhibitors
might more efficiently block the interaction between
MSCs and breast cancer cells.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that EGFR
activation leads to a significant change in the expression
of a wide array of genes coding for secreted proteins that
can significantly enhance tumor progression by acting on
several mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment.
Interestingly, EGFR signalling was found to induce both
quantitative and qualitative changes in the secretome of
MSCs, as also demonstrated by the finding of a novel
VEGFA splice variant in TGFα-treated MSCs. Taken
together, our data suggest that a better understanding of
the factors and the mechanisms involved in the MSCsbreast cancer cells cross-talk might provide the rationale to
develop novel therapeutic strategies aimed to inhibit breast
cancer progression.

METHODS
Cell line
Bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from
Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) and maintained in MSCGM
bullet kit (Lonza) in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C

10525

Oncotarget

and 5% CO2, as suggested by the provider. MSCs were
positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, CD166 and negative
for the markers of the hematopoietic lineage CD14, CD34
and CD45. Cells were used at passages 3–4.

transcriptional events across the entire genome was
performed with LifeScope. The number of observed
counts (number of reads/gene) was normalized for the
length of the transcript and the number of mapped reads
(RPKM) (Reads Per Kilobase per Million of mapped
reads). Comparison between RPKM values obtained
for untreated and TGFα-treated MSCs replicates was
performed by ANOVA test based on one-way analysis
of variance where P-value<0.05 is considered as index of
statistically significant difference. Statistical evaluation of
differential gene expression between untreated and TGFαtreated MSCs was assessed by DEseq tool in R package
that plots log2 fold change versus normalized counts and
uses a significance level P-value=0.05 corrected with a
FDR test threshold of 0.1 [22].
The full dataset of raw data has been deposited in
the GEO database (accession number: GSE60560).

RNA isolation
MSCs were starved overnight in serum free medium
and treated for 1 hour with recombinant human TGFα
(PeproTech,Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) at a concentration of
10 ng/ml. Total RNA was extracted from untreated or
TGFα-treated MSCs using TRIReagent, according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Ambion/Life Technologies,
Milan, Italy). Poly(A) RNA was isolated using the Ambion
MicroPoly(A) Purist Kit (LifeTechnologies).

Whole transcriptome libraries preparation and
RNA-seq

Splice variant analysis

Poly(A) RNA samples were fragmented using
RNASE III and the SOLiD Total RNA-Seq Kit (Life
Technologies). Following cleanup, fragments with
an average size between 125 and 200 nucleotides
were obtained, as determined using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent
Technologies, Milan, Italy). Fragmented RNA was
subjected to hybridization and ligation to SOLiD adaptor
mix. cDNA libraries were subsequently generated by
reverse transcription and purified using the Agencourt
AMPure XP Kit (Beckman Coulter). Purified cDNA was
amplified using SOLiD 5′PCR primers and barcoded
SOLiD 3′PCR primers using the SOLiD RNA Barcoding
Kit (Life Technologies), in order to prepare cDNA
libraries for multiplex sequencing. Amplified cDNA was
purified using the PureLink PCR Micro Kit (Invitrogen/
Life Technologies) and quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen/
Life Technologies). The average size (224 bp) of the
cDNA fragments was determined using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer and the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent
Technologies). Barcoded cDNA libraries were captured
to the surface of beads, amplified by emulsion PCR
and enriched using the SOLiD EZ Beads System (Life
Technologies). Beads were deposited onto a glass slide
and sequenced on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 5500xl
platform (LifeTechnologies) using the paired-end protocol
(75 bp + 35 bp).

Splice Finding tool (Lifescope software) was used
to detect alternatively spliced transcripts of VEGF. The
prediction of the amino acid sequence of the unannotated
splice isoform of VEGF was performed using the Translate
tool (http://web.expasy.org/translate).

Gene enrichment analysis
The Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.
gov) was used to perform functional annotation analysis of
enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways.
Statistical significance was evaluated with a modified
Fisher’s exact test (EASE score) and GO and KEGG terms
with P values< 0.01 were considered significant.

Preparation of conditioned media and
immunoassays
MSCs were seeded in 48-well cell culture plates
(18x103 cells/well) and serum starved overnight. Then,
cells were treated with TGFα (10 ng/ml) and conditioned
media were collected at 2, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours after
treatment, filtered with 0.22 µm syringe filters and stored
in aliquots at -80°C.
The concentration of VEGF, IL6, HB-EGF, LIF,
NGF and CCL2 in the conditioned media from untreated
and TGFα-treated MSCs was determined using BioPlex Cytokine Arrays, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Bio-Rad Life Science, Milan, Italy). The levels
of secreted proteins in conditioned media were referred
as picograms per 105 cells, as determined on the harves­
ting time.
Statistical significance was determined using twotailed Student’s t-test. P values< 0.05 were considered
significant.

Sequencing data analysis
The analysis of the quality of raw data was
performed using the Galaxy platform (http://galaxyproject.
org). Whole-transcriptome reads were aligned to the
version 19 of the human genome (hg19) with the SOLiD
LifeScope Genomic Analysis Software version 2.5
(Life Technologies) using the parameters recommended
in the user’s manual. The automatic quantification of
