Abstract
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family
of transporters, the overexpression of which is associated with
tumor resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents.
Accordingly, combining ABCG2 inhibitor(s) with chemotherapy has the potential to improve treatment outcome. To
search for clinically useful ABCG2 inhibitors, a bioluminescence imaging (BLI)–based assay was developed to allow highthroughput compound screening. This assay exploits our
finding that D-luciferin, the substrate of firefly luciferase
( fLuc), is a specific substrate of ABCG2, and ABCG2 inhibitors
block the export of D-luciferin and enhance bioluminescence
signal by increasing intracellular D-luciferin concentrations.
HEK293 cells, engineered to express ABCG2 and fLuc, were
used to screen the Hopkins Drug Library that includes drugs
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well
as drug candidates that have entered phase II clinical trials.
Forty-seven compounds showed BLI enhancement, a measure
of anti-ABCG2 activity, of z5-fold, the majority of which were
not previously known as ABCG2 inhibitors. The assay was
validated by its identification of known ABCG2 inhibitors and
by confirming previously unknown ABCG2 inhibitors using
established in vitro assays (e.g., mitoxantrone resensitization
and BODIPY-prazosin assays). Glafenine, a potent new
inhibitor, also inhibited ABCG2 activity in vivo. The BLI-based
assay is an efficient method to identify new inhibitors of
ABCG2. As they were derived from a FDA-approved compound
library, many of the inhibitors uncovered in this study are
ready for clinical testing. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5867–75]

Introduction
ABCG2 is a recently described member of the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, a family of proteins that use the energy
of ATP hydrolysis to transport certain chemicals out of cells (1, 2).
The overexpression of ABC transporters has been associated with
multidrug resistance (MDR), a major impediment to successful
cancer chemotherapy. ABCG2 confers resistance to several
chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitoxantrone, daunorubicin,
doxorubicin, bisantrene, topotecan, and flavopiridol (3). In
addition, ABCG2 has been found to affect drug transport across
the gastrointestinal epithelium and the blood-brain barrier (4).

Many believe that judiciously combining ABCG2 inhibitor(s)
with standard cancer chemotherapy will nullify the protection
tumor cells receive, preventing cancer survival and metastasis
(2, 4, 5). However, that idea remains to be tested, largely due to the
lack of suitable ABCG2 inhibitors, despite significant efforts at
discovering them.
We recently showed that D-luciferin, the substrate of firefly
luciferase ( fLuc), is a specific substrate for ABCG2 (6). fLuc is the
most commonly used reporter for imaging transgene expression
in vivo. fLuc catalyzes the oxidation of D-luciferin, releasing
photons that can be quantified through bioluminescence imaging
(BLI; ref. 7). In cells that express both ABCG2 and fLuc, ABCG2
inhibitors, such as fumitremorgin C (FTC; ref. 8), block the export
of D-luciferin and increase the effective intracellular concentration
of D-luciferin that is accessible to fLuc, causing enhanced light
output. BLI is an increasingly widespread imaging technique,
provides an extremely high signal-to-background (S/B) ratio, and is
easy to perform (9).
This study describes the development of a BLI-based highthroughput assay to screen for ABCG2 inhibitors. This assay was
applied to screen a clinically relevant compound library established
at Johns Hopkins University, namely, the Hopkins Drug Library
(HDL; refs. 10, 11). We identified 47 compounds causing a greater
than 5-fold increase in bioluminescence, consistent with marked
ABCG2 inhibition. Some are known ABCG2 inhibitors. Many of
those not previously known were confirmed using established
methods.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. D-luciferin sodium salt was obtained from Gold Biotechnology,
Inc. Verapamil, colchicine, and mitoxantrone were purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. BODIPY-prazosin was obtained from Invitrogen. Glafenine,
flavoxate hydrochloride, and doxazosin mesylate were obtained from Sigma
Chemical. FTC was a kind gift of Dr. S. Bates (National Cancer Institute). All
compounds were prepared in DMSO for in vitro experiments. For in vivo
experiments, ABCG2 inhibitor was dissolved in ethanol/cremophor EL/
saline (1:1:6).
Cell lines. The establishment of ABCG2-overexpressing HEK293 cells
stably transfected with CMV-luc2CP/Hygro (referred to here as HEK293/
ABCG2/fLuc) has been described previously (12). Control empty vector–
transfected HEK293 cells were stably transfected with CMV-luc2CP/Hygro
in the same way and are referred to here as HEK293/empty/fLuc. Cells were
cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the
ABCG2-expressing construct were maintained in medium containing 1 mg/
mL G418 and 100 Ag/mL hygromycin B. ABCG2-overexpressing NCI-H460
human non–small cell lung carcinoma cells (National Cancer Institute,
Frederick, MD) were established and characterized as described previously
(13). They were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin, and streptomycin. All cultures were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator.

BLI assay. HEK293/ABCG2/fLuc cells were plated into 96-well plates at a
density of 4  104/100 AL per well and allowed to attach overnight. The
following day, 10 AL of each compound or the control solvent was
transferred from a compound library in a 96-well, high-throughput format
into the wells using a multichannel pipette. The final concentration of each
compound was f17 Amol/L. D-luciferin (5 AL; 1.2 mg/mL in PBS) was then
added to achieve a final concentration of f50 Ag/mL. The plates were

gently tapped to assure that all solutions were well mixed, and imaging
commenced immediately. Images were taken every 5 min for f1 h. Light
output from each well was quantified at the 40-min time point after
initiation of imaging, and the S/B ratio of the light output from each
compound divided by that from the control well was calculated. This S/B
ratio serves as an indicator of the potency of ABCG2 inhibition, the
mechanism by which BLI signal is enhanced.

High-Throughput Discovery of ABCG2 Inhibitors

Figure 1. Mitoxantrone (MTX ) resensitization assay. NCI-H460/MX20 (ABCG2-overexpressing, human non–small cell lung carcinoma cells) cells were treated for 3 d
with or without mitoxantrone (30 Amol/L in A and 15 Amol/L in B–D) in the presence of a potential inhibitor (20 Amol/L in A–C and 1 Amol/L in D ), and surviving
cells were assessed with the XTT assay. Survival rates were expressed as percentages normalized by the data obtained in the negative control where no mitoxantrone
or any compound was added. FTC (10 Amol/L) was used as a positive control. Numbers on top of bar pairs are survival rates caused by each compound in the
presence of mitoxantrone relative to the compound alone. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE.

Assay performance. Signal-to-noise ratio, S/B, and Z¶ values, which
indicate the robustness of the assay, were calculated as described previously
(14). Background was defined as the light output from cells incubated with
D-luciferin and the solvent only.
Resensitization assay. The ABC transporter–inhibiting ability of the
potential inhibitors identified was further tested by evaluating their ability
to resensitize ABCG2-overexpressing, human non–small cell lung carcinoma (NCI-H460/MX20) cells to mitoxantrone, or MDCKII cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or MRP1, to colchicine. Cells were plated in 96-well
plates at 1  104 per well and allowed to attach. Mitoxantrone was added to
15 or 30 Amol/L, with or without a putative ABCG2 inhibitor. Colchicine
was added at 1 Amol/L for MDCKII/Pgp cells and 0.3 Amol/L for MDCKII/
MRP1 cells. After 2 d of incubation, cell viability was assessed using the 2,3bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner
salt (XTT) assay as described previously (12). All results were normalized to
a percentage of absorbance obtained in controls.
BODIPY-prazosin uptake assay. HEK293/ABCG2 cells were plated in
six-well plates at a density of 1.1  106 per well and allowed to attach. Cells
were then changed into medium containing 0.25 Amol/L BODIPY-prazosin
(15), and compound to be tested was added to a final concentration of
20 Amol/L followed by incubation at 37jC for 1 h. Cells were then
harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS once, resuspended in cold PBS, and
analyzed with flow cytometry. Analyses were performed with FACScan
(Becton Dickinson) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an
emission wavelength of 530 nm. Ten thousand events were counted per
sample. The resultant histograms were analyzed with CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson).
In vivo BLI. Animal protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins
University Animal Care and Use Committee. Both HEK293/ABCG2/fLuc and

www.aacrjournals.org

HEK293/empty/ABCG2 cells were implanted s.c. into 6-wk-old female nude
mice at 1  106 at each site. The IVIS 200 small animal imaging system
(Xenogen Corp.) was used for BLI and 2.5% isoflurane was used for
anesthesia. D-luciferin was injected i.p. into mice at 150 mg/kg, and imaging
was performed every few minutes for >1 h. ABCG2 inhibitor was
administered via tail vein injection as a bolus during imaging, with imaging
continued thereafter.
Data analysis. Living Image (Xenogen) and IGOR (Wavemetrics) image
analysis software were used to superimpose and analyze the corresponding
grayscale photographs and false color BLI images. Light intensities of
regions of interest were expressed as total flux (photons/second). The
IC50 values of identified ABCG2 inhibitors were calculated using GraphPad
Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software) using variable-slope
logistic nonlinear regression analysis. Data are presented as mean F SE
(n = 3).

Results
Statistical evaluation of the BLI-based assay. A HEK293/
ABCG2/fLuc stable clone was chosen for this BLI-based highthroughput screen because FTC, a known specific inhibitor of
ABCG2, enhances its BLI signal output significantly (8). The screen
was performed in a 96-well format. HEK293/ABCG2/fLuc cells were
plated from 1 to 8  104 per well and treated with solvent only or
with FTC. D-luciferin concentrations varied from 20 to 100 Ag/mL,
and imaging data were acquired every 5 minutes for 1 hour. The
quality of the BLI-based high-throughput screen assay was
evaluated statistically as described previously (14). Z¶ values were

calculated for each combination of parameters. An ideal assay is
expected to produce Z¶ = 1, with 1 > Z¶ z 0.5 reflecting a robust
assay. The Z¶ values obtained from this assay ranged from 0.5 to 0.9.
Screening of the HDL using the BLI assay. The HDL is
composed primarily of drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and is the most complete library of clinically
approved drugs (10, 11).
Images were taken every 5 minutes for f1 hour, and light
output from each well at the 40-minute time point was chosen for
quantification. The S/B of the light output from each compound
divided by that from the control well was calculated. This ratio was
used as an indicator of the potency of ABCG2 inhibition, the
mechanism by which BLI signal is enhanced.
The result of the full screen is presented in Supplementary
Table S1. Two hundred and nineteen candidate ABCG2 inhibitors
were identified from 3,273 compounds screened. Candidate
inhibitors are defined as compounds producing at least 2-fold
signal enhancement over control values. About 150 weaker
inhibitors were also identified. Among the 219 potent (>2-fold
signal enhancement) inhibitors, 88 (f40%) had not been
previously reported as an inhibitor or substrate of any ABC
transporter. The majority (f84%) of the f150 weak inhibitors had
not been previously reported as either inhibitors or substrates of
ABC transporters. Forty-seven compounds showed signal enhancement of z5-fold (Table 1). Of those, 10 are known ABCG2 inhibitors
or substrates (Table 1A), validating the assay. The identification of

many previously reported ABCG2 inhibitors, including both potent
and weak ones, such as gefitinib (16), reserpine (17), dipyridamole
(18), and curcumin (19), suggests that the assay is sensitive. The
most potent of the novel inhibitors, glafenine, enhanced the BLI
signal by f20-fold (Table 1B).
Confirmation of candidate ABCG2 inhibitors using established assays. We used two established assays, the mitoxantrone
resensitization assay (1) and the BODIPY-prazosin fluorescent dye
uptake assay (15), to confirm that compounds identified in the BLI
screen were indeed ABCG2 inhibitors.
Twenty-eight novel candidate ABCG2 inhibitors identified in the
BLI screen were tested by mitoxantrone resensitization assay, a
hallmark of ABCG2 inhibitor function (4). Both ABCG2-overexpressing H460/MX20 cells and the parent line were treated with
mitoxantrone (15 or 30 Amol/L) for 3 days. As expected, H460/
MX20 cells survived exposure to mitoxantrone better than the
parent cells due to the induced expression of ABCG2 (f40% versus
f9% survival in 30 Amol/L mitoxantrone and f80% versus <20%
in 15 Amol/L mitoxantrone). The potent, selective ABCG2 inhibitor
FTC restored the sensitivity of H460/MX20 cells to mitoxantrone
and significantly reduced their survival rate. Twenty-eight novel
candidate inhibitors were initially tested at 20 Amol/L for 3 days.
Twenty showed a similar capacity to sensitize H460/MX20 cells to
mitoxantrone, confirming that they are indeed ABCG2 inhibitors
(Fig. 1A–C). Brij 30 was found to resensitize H460/MX20 cells to
mitoxantrone significantly after 2 days of incubation (data not

shown). The most active inhibitors were glafenine and doxazosin
mesylate, which, at concentrations of 20 Amol/L, reduced the
survival of H460/MX20 cells to 12% and 18%, respectively. These
results were consistent with their considerable activity in the BLI
screen (20- and 16-fold signal enhancement, respectively). That
suggests that the magnitude of BLI signal enhancement can reflect
the potency of ABCG2 inhibitors.
Six compounds, including quinacrine, verteporfin, digitoxin,
clomiphene citrate, calcimycin, and gramicidin A, were too
cytotoxic to be tested at 20 Amol/L (Fig. 1A–C). Each was tested
again at 1 Amol/L with 15 Amol/L mitoxantrone for 2 days. At this
lower concentration, quinacrine, verteporfin, clomiphene citrate,
and gramicidin A showed resensitization of H460/MX20 cells to
mitoxantrone, confirming them as ABCG2 inhibitors (Fig. 1D). The
other two, digitoxin and calcimycin, were tested at even lower
concentrations (0.3, 0.1, and 0.03 Amol/L). They were no longer
cytotoxic at 0.1 and 0.03 Amol/L but did not reduce the survival
rate of H460/MX20 cells significantly after 2 days when coincubated with 15 Amol/L mitoxantrone (data not shown). However, at
these lower concentrations (0.03 and 0.1 Amol/L), they enhanced
BLI signal minimally (data not shown).
In summary, 26 of the 28 candidate compounds identified in the
BLI assay were confirmed by the mitoxantrone resensitization
assay to be new ABCG2 inhibitors. Compounds designated as false
positive were actually difficult to test in the mitoxantrone
resensitization assay by virtue of their direct cytotoxicity and had
to be tested at very low (noncytotoxic) doses below which their
ability to inhibit ABCG2 was also compromised.
Sixteen of the candidate ABCG2 inhibitors were also tested with
the BODIPY-prazosin assay. HEK293/ABCG2 cells were incubated
with BODIPY-prazosin and each test compound and then subjected
to flow cytometry. Nine of the 16 compounds, glafenine,
tracazolate, doxazosin mesylate, quinacrine, clebopride, flutamide,
flavoxate hydrochloride, rotenone, and podophyllum resin, were
positive by this assay. Notably, seven compounds identified by the
BLI assay and confirmed by mitoxantrone resensitization assay,
acepromazine, acetophenazine maleate, metyrapone, piperacetazine, raloxifene hydrochloride, riboflavin, and verteporfin, were

negative according to this assay (Fig. 2). However, all seven were
confirmed by the mitoxantrone resensitization assay. The results of
the mitoxantrone resensitization and the BODIPY-prazosin assays
are compared in Table 2.
Sensitivity of the BLI assay. The BLI assay was further
evaluated by searching the HDL for previously known ABCG2
inhibitors. Due to the relatively recent characterization of ABCG2,
relatively few ABCG2 inhibitors are known (20). Twenty-five
previously known ABCG2 inhibitors/substrates were found to be
included in the HDL. In addition to the 10 compounds listed in
Table 1A producing significant BLI signal, 15 additional known
ABCG2 inhibitors are present in the HDL (Supplementary
Table S2). Twenty-two of those compounds enhanced the BLI
signal significantly ( from 2.3- to 19-fold), and only 3, naringenin,
acacetin, and genistein, enhanced the BLI signal <2-fold (1.9-, 1.8-,
and 1.2-fold, respectively).
Further characterization of selected new ABCG2 inhibitors.
As described previously (12), an ABCG2 inhibitor can enhance
fLuc-based BLI signal in a dose-dependent manner. The BLI signalenhancing effect of selected ABCG2 inhibitors was evaluated within
the range of 0.001 to 100 Amol/L with HEK293/ABCG2/fLuc cells
and 50 Ag/mL D-luciferin. The data obtained at 40 minutes after
imaging commencement were chosen arbitrarily to be plotted
(Fig. 3A). The IC50 value of glafenine as an ABCG2 inhibitor was
calculated to be 3.2 Amol/L. For three other ABCG2 inhibitors,
doxazosin mesylate, flavoxate hydrochloride, and clebopride
maleate, the BLI signal did not reach a plateau even at
concentrations as high as 100 Amol/L. Assuming that the BLI
signal produced by each compound at 100 Amol/L approaches a
maximum value, the IC50 values of doxazosin mesylate, flavoxate
hydrochloride, and clebopride maleate can be calculated to be 8.0,
20, and 8.2 Amol/L, respectively. The same assay was used to
calculate the IC50 value of FTC, and it was determined to be
6.6 Amol/L using the 30-minute data. Although that value deviates
from the IC50 values reported for FTC in literature (0.3–1.3 Amol/L),
the discrepancy may be caused by the fact that the assays involve
different substrates. In terms of its ability to inhibit ATPase, Robey
and colleagues (13) measured the IC50 value of FTC to be 1 Amol/L,

Figure 3. ABCG2 inhibitors cause a dose-dependent response in assays measuring the activity of ABCG2 inhibitors. A, enhancement of bioluminescence signal in

whereas Özvegy and colleagues obtained values of 1.3 Amol/L (21)
and 0.4 Amol/L (22). The IC50 value of FTC was also reported to be
0.8 Amol/L using the pheophorbide A fluorescent dye uptake assay
(23). According to those previous reports, FTC reached the plateau
of its ABCG2-inhibiting effect at a concentration of 10 Amol/L, but
the BLI assay indicates that higher concentrations would be
needed to provide a maximal inhibitory effect (Fig. 3A).
The dose-dependent effect of ABCG2 inhibitors was also
evaluated with the mitoxantrone resensitization assay. ABCG2overexpressing H460/MX20 cells were incubated for 3 days with
increasing concentrations of each ABCG2 inhibitor in addition to
15 Amol/L mitoxantrone, and the survival rates were plotted
against the concentration of each compound (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the IC50 values of each ABCG2 inhibitor obtained from
BLI assay, glafenine proved a more potent ABCG2 inhibitor than

FTC, doxazosin mesylate, clebopride maleate, and flavoxate
hydrochloride.
To check whether newly identified ABCG2 inhibitors were
specific to ABCG2 as opposed to inhibiting other MDR pumps
generally, they were also tested for their ability to inhibit ABCB1/
Pgp and ABCC1/MRP1. The resensitization assay was performed
with MDCKII cells overexpressing Pgp or MRP1 (24) using
colchicine, a Pgp and MRP1 substrate (25, 26). MDCKII cells overexpressing Pgp or MRP1 were incubated for 2 days in medium
containing 1 Amol/L ( for Pgp) or 0.3 Amol/L ( for MRP1) of colchicine and increasing concentrations of each ABCG2 inhibitor. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A, compared with verapamil,
glafenine is a more potent Pgp inhibitor, doxazosin mesylate has
similar potency, and clebopride maleate and flavoxate hydrochloride
show weak Pgp-inhibiting ability at relatively high concentration

(30 Amol/L). Glafenine and doxazosin mesylate have similar
potencies to verapamil for MRP1 inhibition, whereas clebopride
maleate and flavoxate hydrochloride proved weak even at relatively
high concentration (30 Amol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1B). However,
all of these ABCG2 inhibitors are specific for ABCG2 at low
concentrations (V1 Amol/L). For example, glafenine can effectively
resensitize H460/MX20 cells to mitoxantrone at a concentration as
low as 0.001 Amol/L (Fig. 1B) but does not provide resensitization
of MDCKII/Pgp or MDCKII/MRP1 cells to colchicine until 1 or
10 Amol/L, respectively.
In vivo inhibition of ABCG2 activity by selected new ABCG2
inhibitors. Two of the newly identified ABCG2 inhibitors, glafenine
and doxazosin mesylate, were tested further for their ability to
inhibit ABCG2 function in vivo. We have previously shown that
administration of FTC in vivo can significantly enhance
D-luciferin–dependent BLI signal output of xenografts derived
from ABCG2-overexpressing HEK293 cells (6). Here, we used the
same strategy to test the effect of these new ABCG2 inhibitors in
vivo. HEK293/empty/fLuc and HEK293/ABCG2/fLuc cells were
implanted s.c. into opposite flanks of female nude mice. Five mice
were implanted to generate 10 ABCG2-overexpressing xenografts
and 5 controls. Animals were imaged after D-luciferin administration, which was followed by a bolus injection of a single dose of
ABCG2 inhibitor and continued imaging. After glafenine injection
(25 mg/kg, i.v.), 9 of 10 ABCG2-overexpressing xenografts showed
enhanced BLI signal over the control in the same mouse. Those 10
xenografts showed an average of f2.9-fold signal enhancement
over the control with the highest approaching 6.7-fold (Fig. 4).
Glafenine caused increases in BLI signal of up to f11.6-fold and
f17.4-fold in two separate HEK293/ABCG2/fLuc xenografts (right
front and rear flanks) in the same mouse compared with the signals
generated by those xenografts immediately before injection. By
contrast, the BLI signal of the HEK293/empty/fLuc xenograft in the
left flank increased by only f2.6-fold (Fig. 4). Doxazosin mesylate
injection caused a similar but weaker BLI signal enhancement of
ABCG2-overexpressing xenografts in vivo (data not shown).

assay. All but two were confirmed by the mitoxantrone resensitization assay. The low false-positive rate may be explained by a
previous report, where a screen of >70,000 compounds by an assay
using pure fLuc found no activator of the luciferase-coupled
reaction that could enhance the luminescent signal (27). The signal
enhancement seen in our BLI assay is attributed only to the
increased intracellular concentration of D-luciferin on administration of putative ABCG2 inhibitors from our library. However,
caution is still required because ABCG2 may not be the only
membrane transporter that affects the permeability of D-luciferin.
In addition, pore-forming agents or detergents that disrupt cell
membranes may cause false positives because of the leakage of
D-luciferin into cells. Among the two compounds identified in this
screen that could not be confirmed by the mitoxantrone
resensitization assay, calcimycin is a cation ionophore and falls
into this category.
The BLI-based assay is very sensitive with no false negatives
obtained. Whereas the results of the mitoxantrone resensitization
assay were as expected, those of the BODIPY-prazosin dye uptake
assay were intriguing. Only 9 of 16 compounds tested were
confirmed by this fluorescence-based assay and 7 (f44%) failed
this assay altogether. All of the seven compounds were confirmed
by the mitoxantrone resensitization assay (Table 2). Notably,
mitoxantrone resistance is the hallmark of the ABCG2-inhibiting
phenotype (28, 29); therefore, this discrepancy suggests a high

Discussion
We have developed and evaluated a cell-based, high-throughput
assay to uncover new inhibitors of ABCG2. This assay builds on our
finding that D-luciferin, the substrate of fLuc, is a specific substrate
of ABCG2 and uses BLI to screen for ABCG2 inhibitors (6). The
screening of 3,273 compounds identified 219 candidate ABCG2
inhibitors with at least a 2-fold signal enhancement over controls,
f60% of which have been previously reported as ABCG2
inhibitors, including gefitinib, prazosin, and harmine. The ability
to identify known ABC transporter inhibitors, both potent and
weak, proved that the assay is sensitive and reliable. The results
also show the ability of the assay to identify previously unknown
ABCG2 inhibitors. Approximately 40% of the 219 potent and f84%
of the f150 less potent compounds have never been reported
previously as being inhibitors or substrates of an ABC transporter.
The less potent compounds, in particular, may be difficult to
identify with other methods.
The power of the BLI assay was further shown by the
confirmation of the majority (26 of 28) of the new ABCG2
inhibitors uncovered, indicating a low false-positive rate. Twentyeight candidate ABCG2 inhibitors with over 5-fold signal enhancement were subjected to the mitoxantrone resensitization assay, and
16 of them were also tested with the BODIPY-prazosin dye uptake

false-negative rate for the BODIPY-prazosin assay. To understand
the discrepancy better, we analyzed the structures of the seven
compounds that could not be confirmed by the BODIPY-prazosin
assay. Metyrapone, acepromazine, piperacetazine, and acetophenazine have an aromatic ketone functional group, which can act as
an electron acceptor and deactivate the singlet state of BODIPY via
an intermolecular electron transfer process (30, 31). Porphyrin in
verteporin and benzopteridine in riboflavin can quench the
fluorescence of BODIPY by way of photoinduced electron transfer
(32, 33). It has been reported previously that the fluorescence of
several dyes used to probe mitochondrial transmembrane potential
can be quenched by some anticancer drugs, including adaphostin,
mitoxantrone, and amsacrine (34). Accordingly, fluorescence-based
assays must be cautiously applied. The implication of this finding is
significant. Because fluorescence-based assays have seen the most
use in discovering new ABCG2 inhibitors (13, 23, 35, 36), it is
possible that many ABCG2 inhibitors that quench fluorescence
have been missed. The BLI-based screening assay described here
has the advantage of not being prone to such an artifact. That
advantage was shown by our search of the HDL for previously
known ABCG2 inhibitors, which revealed that the BLI-based assay
missed none of them.
The BLI-based assay is efficient due to the elimination of
incubation and wash steps. Several hundred drugs can be screened
in 1 day using the current system, with many thousands of drugs
possible if the technique were automated. False negatives caused
by cytotoxicity in extended incubation are not a concern.
Candidate ABCG2 inhibitors obtained from our screen of the
HDL are categorized based on their therapeutic effects and can be
clustered into several classes, including drugs affecting the
cardiovascular and central nervous systems, the gastrointestinal

system, among others (Supplementary Table S3). Previously, it has
been reported that ABCG2 is expressed in brain, colon, small and
large intestine, venous endothelium, and capillaries, suggesting that
the expression pattern indicates that ABCG2 plays a protective role
in these tissues. However, further evidence is needed to support
that hypothesis (4). Our discovery that many drugs treating
diseases associated with these tissues are ABCG2 inhibitors is
consistent with the possible functions of ABCG2 indicated by its
expression pattern. The involvement of ABCG2 in some of the
processes represented by the classes of agents uncovered in our
assay has been recognized previously. Many anti-HIV drugs inhibit
ABCG2 (37), and a bidirectional interaction between epidermal
growth factor receptor and ABCG2 has been reported (38). The
roles that ABCG2 may play in most of the other processes have not
been studied extensively. Information obtained from this screen
may shed light on new mechanisms of action of drugs designed for
other purposes. Because most of the compounds in the HDL library
have been approved by the FDA, certain candidates could be
immediately used in conjunction with standard cancer chemotherapy to help combat the effects of ABC transporter expression,
which often confound such treatment.
