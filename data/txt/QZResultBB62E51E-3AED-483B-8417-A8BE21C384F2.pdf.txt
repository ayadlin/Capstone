Summary

Author Manuscript

ERK signaling requires RAS-induced RAF dimerization and is limited by feedback. Activated
BRAF mutants evade feedback inhibition of RAS by either of two mechanisms. BRAF V600
mutants are activated monomers when RAS activity is low; all other activating BRAF mutants
function as constitutive RAS-independent dimers. RAF inhibitors effectively inhibit mutant
monomers, but not dimers; their binding to one site in the dimer significantly reduces their affinity
for the second. Tumors with non-V600E BRAF mutants are insensitive to these drugs and
increased expression of BRAF V600E dimers causes acquired resistance. A compound that
equally inhibits both sites of mutant RAF dimers inhibits tumors driven by either class of mutants

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The oncogenic activation of ERK signaling output is characteristic of many cancers.
Physiologic activation of the pathway occurs when upstream signals stimulate the binding of
RAS to GTP (Luo et al., 1996; Rajakulendran et al., 2009). Activated RAS binds to RAF
family members and causes their homo- and heterodimerization and activation (Freeman et
al., 2013). This, in turn, initiates the MEK/ERK kinase cascade and phosphorylation of
effectors of the pathway by ERK. Activation of ERK also causes an array of negative
regulatory events that serve to inhibit the pathway. ERK phosphorylates and inhibits
receptors (Avraham and Yarden, 2011), the RAS GDP-GTP exchange factor SOS (Dong et
al., 1996), and WT CRAF and BRAF (Dougherty et al., 2005). It also increases the
expression of members of the Sprouty and DUSP families of proteins that inhibit the
pathway (Pratilas et al., 2009). The former inhibit RTK activation of RAS whereas the latter
are MAPK phosphatases (Lang et al., 2006). Thus, negative feedback limits the amplitude
and duration of the ERK signal.

Author Manuscript

Oncogenic mutations of NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and NF1 drive the ERK dependent
growth of many human cancers. These mutations activate both downstream signaling and
potent negative feedback, as evidenced by reactivation of upstream and parallel components
of the pathway in cells exposed to MEK or RAF inhibitors (Corcoran et al., 2012; Lito et al.,
2012; Montero-Conde et al., 2013). We hypothesize that the elevated signaling output
necessary for transformation requires selection of oncoproteins with decreased sensitivity to
negative feedback. Mutations and translocations of RAF family genes are common in human
tumors (Wan et al., 2004; Davies et al., 2002; Palanisamy et al., 2010). V600E is the most
common BRAF mutation, but non-V600E mutations account for more than 50% of the RAF
mutations in lung cancers (Paik et al., 2011) and occur in many other tumors. The kinase
activity of many of these mutants has been shown to be activated compared to wild type, but
some BRAF mutations are kinase-dead or have lower activity than WT BRAF (Wan et al.,
2004). RAF fusions and truncations in which part of the aminoterminal domain of RAF is
usually deleted also occur rarely in many tumors and in a high percentage of pilocytic
astrocytomas (Berghoff and Preusser, 2014). Here we ask how activating mutations of RAF
hyperactivate signaling in the setting of ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS.

Activating mutants of BRAF hyperactivate ERK signaling and suppress RAS activation
RAS-GTP is suppressed in BRAF V600E tumor cells by ERK-dependent feedback (Lito et
al., 2012). We asked whether this is a general property of tumor cells with activated mutant
BRAFs. Levels of RAS-GTP and CRAF phosphorylation at serine 338 (pCRAF S338, a
marker of CRAF activation) (Mason et al., 1999) were much lower in tumor cells with
activating BRAF V600E, K601N, L597V, L597R or G469A mutations than in those with
WT RAF (Figure S1A). In contrast, levels of phosphorylated MEK (p-MEK) are highly

elevated in RAF mutant cells even compared to those with mutant RAS. These results
suggest that MEK is activated but RAS and CRAF are feedback inhibited in tumor cells with
activating BRAF mutants.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether suppression of RAS activity is a general property of these mutants, we
expressed mutant BRAFs in an inducible fashion in NIH3T3 cells (Figure. 1A). Inductions
of the expression of BRAF V600E, V600K, K601E, L597Q, G469A, G469V, or G464V at
levels comparable to those of endogenous BRAF caused significant induction of p-MEK and
p-ERK and marked inhibition of RAS-GTP and pCRAF S338. Induction of WT BRAF
caused minor increases in p-MEK and p-ERK and had no effect on RAS-GTP or pCRAF
S338. Thus, activated RAF mutants significantly increase ERK signaling despite causing
feedback inhibition of RAS activity to almost undetectable levels. By contrast, kinase-dead
BRAF D594G, and low activity BRAF G466E and D287H neither activated ERK signaling
nor inhibited RAS function. These mutants may function in a fundamentally different way
than the activating mutants, as previously suggested (Heidorn et al., 2010). This paper will
focus on activating mutants of BRAF and how they function in cells in which RAS is
feedback inhibited.
Activation of signaling by hyperactivated RAF mutants is RAS-independent

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our findings imply that activated BRAF mutants signal in a RAS-independent manner and
are thus insensitive to upstream feedback. To test this hypothesis, we used the ERBB2
amplified breast cancer cell SKBR3 in which RAS activity and ERK signaling are potently
suppressed after 1 hr exposure to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib (Figure S1B). This system
allows us to assess the RAS dependence of exogenously expressed RAF mutants. lapatinib
inhibited ERK signaling in SKBR3 cells overexpressing WT BRAF, but failed to do so in
those that express activating BRAF mutants (Figure. 1B and S1C). Moreover, when CRAF
or BRAF were immunoprecipitated from these cells, BRAF associated kinase activity was
only sensitive to lapatinib in cells expressing WT BRAF, not in those expressing mutant
BRAF (Figure. 1B and S1C). In contrast, CRAF associated kinase activity was sensitive to
lapatinib in all cells. Thus, the kinase activity of activating BRAF mutants is RASindependent. To exclude the possibility that their activity requires low levels of residual
RAS-GTP, the R188L mutation that disrupts the RAS-BRAF interaction (Fabian et al.,
1994) was introduced into the activating BRAF mutants and did not affect their ability to
drive signaling (Figure. 1C). To further confirm that these activating BRAF mutants signal in
a RAS-independent manner, we utilized conditional RAS-less mouse embryo fibroblasts
(MEFs) (Drosten et al., 2014). Knockout of Kras, the only RAS gene in these cells, causes
their proliferative arrest and abrogates ERK signaling, but they remain viable. All of the
activating BRAF mutants rescue MEK/ERK phosphorylation in these cells, but WT BRAF
does not (Figure S1D). We have tested 16 activating BRAF mutants (Table 1) and all signal
in a RAS-independent manner.
RAS-independent BRAF mutants fall in two classes: active constitutive dimers and
mutants that are active as monomers in cells with low RAS activity
Previous data suggested that V600E BRAF can signal as a monomer and is thus RAS
independent (Poulikakos et al., 2011). We asked whether this is the general mechanism that

underlies the RAS-independence of activating RAF mutants. To address this question, we
utilized the R509H and R401H/A mutations that impair dimerization of BRAF and CRAF,
respectively, and eliminate their kinase activity (Poulikakos et al., 2010). R509H or R401H
were introduced into BRAF or CRAF and multiple BRAF and CRAF mutants or truncations
and expressed in SKBR3 cells. (Figure. 2A) ERK signaling in SKBR3 cells expressing these
mutants was assessed after lapatinib treatment (low RAS-GTP state). ERK signaling was
undetectable in cells when WT BRAF was overexpressed. Low levels of p-ERK were
detected in cells overexpressing CRAF, but not in cells with CRAF 401H. The effects of
R509H on ERK signaling were tested in 15 different activated BRAF mutants that were
identified in human tumors (Figure. 2A; Table 1). ERK signaling driven by 11 of the 15 was
reduced to very low levels. The 4 mutants unaffected by the R509H were all V600 mutants
(V600E/K/D/R). In contrast, the activities of K601 mutants, including K601E, are abrogated
by the R509H mutation.

Author Manuscript

The results suggest that, in cells with low RAS activity, BRAF V600 mutants signal as
active monomers, whereas all other BRAF activating mutants signal as constitutive, RASindependent dimers. We confirmed this conclusion in the RAS-deficient MEFs. BRAF V600
R509H mutants restore ERK signaling in these cells, R509H mutants of non-V600 BRAF
mutants do not (Figure S2A).

We asked whether the non-V600 BRAF activating mutants function as BRAF homodimers
or BRAF/CRAF heterodimers. When these mutants were expressed in Raf1, which encodes
CRAF, knockout (KO) MEFs, they all potently activate ERK signaling and remain sensitive
to R509H (Figure S2B). Thus, CRAF is not required for activation of ERK signaling by
BRAF mutants that signal as constitutively active dimers. We evaluated the ability of these
BRAF mutants to homodimerize and to heterodimerize with CRAF as a function of cellular
RAS activity. We co-expressed V5- and FLAG-tagged BRAF mutants in SKBR3 cells, and
assessed co-precipitation of V5 with either FLAG (mutant BRAF homodimers) or CRAF
(mutant BRAF/WT CRAF heterodimers) (Figure. 2B). In control cells with adequate RASGTP levels, either wild type BRAF or BRAF mutants form both BRAF homodimers and
BRAF/CRAF heterodimers. One hour after inhibition of RAS activity with lapatinib, BRAF/
CRAF heterodimers were lost from all cells. BRAF homodimers were lost in cells
overexpressing WT BRAF or BRAF V600 mutant alleles, but ERK phosphorylation was
abrogated only in the former (Figure. 2B). Thus formation of BRAF V600E/K homodimers
is RAS-dependent, but both BRAF V600E/K dimers and monomers can activate ERK
signaling. In contrast, dimerization and activity of non-V600 BRAF mutants are RASindependent (Figure. 2B; Table 1). We conclude that activating BRAF mutants evade
feedback by either of two mechanisms: The dimerization of V600 mutants remains RASdependent, but their activity is not dependent on dimerization. Monomers of all of non-V600
BRAF activating mutants are inactive, and they all signal as active RAS-independent
homodimers.
In cancer, RAF kinase is also activated by a variety of translocations and aberrant splice
forms that encode fusion or truncated proteins in which an N-terminal domain containing the
RAS-binding site is almost always deleted (Figure. S2C). Engineered deletion of this
domain has been shown to result in constitutive dimerization and activation (Cutler et al.,

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 14.

1998), so it seems likely that these fusions are also activated in this way. Cat C, an

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

engineered N-terminal deletion of CRAF, and p61 WT BRAF, an engineered N-terminal
deletion of BRAF, are activated constitutive dimers whose activity is abrogated by the
R401H and R509H mutants respectively (Figure. 2A). Similarly, ESRP1-CRAF and
KIAA1549-BRAF are tumor-derived fusion proteins in which the N terminal domain of
CRAF or BRAF has been replaced by the fusion partner (Figure. S2C). They also activate
ERK signaling in a RAS-independent manner and their activity is abrogated by the R401A
and R509H mutations respectively (Figure. S2D). Thus, fusions and truncated RAFs that
lack the N-terminal domain are RAS independent kinases whose activity is dependent on
their constitutive dimerization. A truncated p61 BRAF V600E was found to be responsible
for the acquired resistance of some melanomas to RAF inhibitors. (Poulikakos et al., 2011)
This truncated BRAF V600E is a RAS independent dimer, but its activity is not abrogated
by R509H (Figure. 2A). The N-terminal truncation of BRAF V600E causes it to dimerize in
a RAS-independent manner, but the V600E mutation causes it to be active as a monomer or
dimer. Thus, with the singular exception of BRAF mutants with V600 missense mutations,
so far all tested activating mutations, translocations, and fusions of RAF bypass ERK
dependent feedback by constitutively dimerizing in a RAS-independent manner. Uniquely,
the V600 mutants do so by functioning as active monomers when RAS-GTP is low.
RAF mutants that act as constitutive dimers are resistant to RAF inhibitors

Author Manuscript

The RAF inhibitor vemurafenib inhibits ERK signaling in tumors in which it is driven by
BRAF V600E and not in those in which it is driven by RAS (Poulikakos et al., 2010). We
used the SKBR3, low RAS-GTP (lapatinib treated) system to determine the sensitivity to
vemurafenib of activating RAF mutants that signal as constitutive dimers. All such mutants
were resistant, including non-V600 BRAF mutants, the truncated CRAF (Cat C) and BRAF
(p61 WT) proteins (Figure. 2C; Table 1) and the two tested fusion proteins (Figure. S2D).
Vemurafenib transactivates truncated WT dimers, whereas activated BRAF mutants that
constitutively dimerize are resistant to the drug but not activated further (Figure. 2C). The
only BRAF mutants that are sensitive to this drug are the four V600 mutants we tested
(Figure. 2C; Table 1). Similar results were observed in Raf1 KO MEFs (Figure. S2E). So far
there is an absolute correlation between the ability of a mutant to signal as a monomer and
its sensitivity to vemurafenib.
Expression of BRAF V600E dimers causes acquired resistance to vemurafenib

Author Manuscript

These results suggest that increased expression of activated RAF dimers will cause
resistance to RAF inhibitors. Expression of p61 BRAF V600E or mutant NRAS and BRAF
V600E amplification are common causes of acquired resistance to these drugs (Nazarian et
al., 2010; Poulikakos et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2012). p61 BRAF V600E-dependent acquired
resistance depends on its dimerization (Poulikakos et al., 2011) and mutant NRAS promotes
the dimerization of BRAF V600E with CRAF (Figure. S3A). However, the mechanism
whereby BRAF V600E amplification induces resistance remains unclear. We used A375, a
melanoma cell line homozygous for BRAF V600E, to generate stable clones that expressed
Tet-regulated BRAF V600E, BRAF V600E R509H or NRAS Q61K. Increased expression
of either BRAF V600E, which is used to model BRAF V600E amplification, or mutant
NRAS caused increasing resistance to inhibition of ERK signaling by vemurafenib (Figure.
Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 14.

3A). Expression of mutant NRAS was associated with an elevation of cellular RAS-GTP
levels (data not shown) and induction of BRAF V600E-CRAF heterodimers (Figure. S3A. It
is likely that induction of these RAS driven dimers is responsible for drug resistance).

Author Manuscript

By contrast, in cells in which BRAF V600E was overexpressed, significant BRAF V600E
homodimerization occurs. Increasing amount of plasmids encoding FLAG tagged BRAF
V600E were transfected into A375 cells that expressed V5-tagged BRAF V600E. As shown
in Figure. S3B, homodimers were detected when either tag was immunoprecipitated.
Homodimer levels increased in direct proportion to the levels of expression of FLAG-tagged
BRAF V600E. Under these conditions, neither V600E BRAF/CRAF heterodimerization nor
induction of RAS-GTP occurs. These results suggest that BRAF V600E amplification
causes acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors because it increases BRAF V600E
homodimerization. To test this idea, we compared the effects of overexpressing BRAF
V600E with those induced by overexpressing the dimerization impaired BRAF V600E
R509H. As shown in Figure. 3B, cells expressing modest levels of BRAF V600E or BRAF
V600E R509H are similarly sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50s ~100–300 nM). However, at
higher levels of expression (Figure. 3C), cells with BRAF V600E were significantly less
sensitive than those expressing the R509H mutant. (IC50> 10,000 nM vs ~300 nM) Thus,
these data suggest that BRAF V600E amplification causes acquired resistance by increasing
levels of BRAF V600E homodimers.
Binding of RAF inhibitors to one site in the dimer reduces their affinity for the other

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Binding of inhibitors to CRAF or BRAF induces both RAF dimerization and the allosteric
transactivation of the unbound protomer of the dimer (Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010; Poulikakos
et al., 2010). However, neither mechanism explains why ATP-competitive inhibitors don’t
bind to both sites and inhibit the dimer. Allosteric regulation of multimeric protein
complexes is often associated with cooperative effects on ligand binding. We took advantage
of the availability of systems in which the ability of drug to inhibit active monomeric or
dimeric mutant BRAF can be compared to assess the possibility that drug binding to one
protomer of the dimer reduces its affinity for the other. p61 BRAF V600E signals as a
constitutive dimer, whereas p61 BRAF V600E R509H signals as a monomer (Poulikakos et
al., 2011). p61 BRAF V600E and p61 BRAF V600E R509H were each expressed in
SKBR3, and the effects of RAF inhibitors on ERK signaling were assessed in these cells
under low RAS conditions. Vemurafenib inhibits ERK signaling in SKBR3 cells expressing
p61 BRAF V600E R509H or BRAF V600E at similar concentrations (IC50 ~ 100–300 nM)
(Figure. S4A). We take this as the concentration required to inhibit the monomer. Binding of
drug to one protomer of truncated WT dimers causes transactivation of the other. We find
that the 50% induction of p61 WT BRAF-driven ERK signaling by vemurafenib is also
approximately 100–300 nM (Figure. S4B and S4C). This is thus the concentration required
to bind to monomers and to the first site of the dimer.
By contrast, more than 30-fold higher concentrations of vemurafenib were required to
inhibit ERK driven by p61 V600E dimers than by p61 V600E R509H monomers (Figure.
4A) The same relative difference was observed with another, more potent, RAF inhibitor
dabrafenib (Figure 4A). We take the concentration required to inhibit ERK signaling in the

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 14.

Yao et al.

p61 BRAF V600E cells as the concentration required inhibiting both sites in the dimer.
These data therefore imply that the relative affinity of vemurafenib for the first binding site
in a BRAF homodimer is 30-fold higher than that for the second site when the first site is
occupied by drug. In isogenic p61 BRAF experiments, the RAF mutants were expressed in a
heterologous cellular system—SKBR3. To interrogate a tumor system in which activated
BRAF V600E mutant monomers or dimers are expressed we used SK-MEL239, a BRAF
V600E melanoma cell line, and SK-MEL239 C4, a vemurafenib resistant clone of SKMEL239 (Poulikakos et al., 2011) that expresses p61 V600E dimers (Figure. S4D). 30-fold
higher concentrations of dabrafenib were required to inhibit ERK signaling in the latter
compared to the former (Figure. 4B). The data suggests that binding of the drug to the first
site in the dimer reduces its affinity for the second and that this explains why monomerdriven ERK signaling is so much more sensitive to these drugs than that driven by dimers.

Identification of a compound that inhibits RAF monomers and dimers at similar
concentrations

Author Manuscript

To identify compounds that inhibit monomer and dimers with similar potency, we screened
22 known RAF inhibitors against SK-MEL-239 and SK-MEL-239 C4. Results for six of
these compounds are shown in Figure. S4D and their chemical structures are shown in Table
S1. The concentrations required for five of these six to inhibit ERK signaling driven by the
dimer were significantly higher (5 to 85-fold) than those that inhibit monomer driven
signaling (Figure 4B and Figure. S4D). LGX818 inhibited monomer driven signaling at 14
nM, and dimer signaling at 287 nM, despite its high potency and low off-rate (see below.).
By contrast, BGB659, a type II, ATP-competitive RAF inhibitor (compound 27 from Gould
et al., 2011) inhibited ERK signaling driven by p61 BRAF V600E dimers and BRAF V600E
monomers at similar doses (Figure 4B and Figure. S4D). Its inhibition of ERK signaling is
mediated by its binding to BRAF; the T529 BRAF gatekeeper mutation (Heidorn et al.,
2010) confers resistance to the drug (Figure. S4E). In cells that express either BRAF V600E
T529N or p61 BRAF V600E T529N, ERK signaling is resistant to both vemurafenib and
BGB659 but not to the MEK inhibitor trametinib.

Author Manuscript

BGB659 could inhibit BRAF V600E dimers by a variety of mechanisms. We show below
(Figure. 6B) that, like most RAF inhibitors, BGB659 induces RAF dimerization, so it is not
a ‘dimer breaker’. We have not been able to recreate the resistance of RAF dimers to
inhibitors in defined in vitro systems. We therefore developed a cellular system in which
only one site of the RAF dimer is occupied by a RAF inhibitor and used it to determine the
concentration of drug required to bind to and inhibit the second site when the first is already
bound. The RAF inhibitor LGX818, which has a very slow off-rate, was utilized. After 1 hr
exposure of BRAF V600E tumor cells to vemurafenib or LGX818, ERK signaling is
inhibited (Figure. S4F). 1 hr after washout of the drug, ERK phosphorylation returned to
pre-exposure levels in the vemurafenib treated cells, but remains inhibited in the LGX818
treated cells. Thus, after 1 hr of wash out, the BRAF V600E monomer remains bound to
LGX818.
SK-MEL-30 is a cell line with mutant NRAS and WT RAF. As expected, vemurafenib
activates ERK signaling in these cells by binding to one protomer of WT RAF dimers and

transactivating the other. (Figure. S4G) 1 hr after washout of vemurafenib, p-ERK returned
to baseline, likely due to dissociation of drug from the first site. LGX818 also induced pERK at low concentrations, but, in contrast to Vemuraftenib, induction persisted after 1 hr of
washout of the drug, consistent with persistent binding to the first site due to its low off-rate
(Figure. S4G). Peak induction of ERK occurred at 100 nM LGX818 and actually increased 1
hr after the drug was washed out. At higher concentrations (300–3000 nM), LGX818 caused
a concentration-dependent inhibition of ERK signaling. This is consistent with its binding to
and inhibiting both sites in the dimer. At these concentrations, wash out for 1 hr
hyperactivates ERK signaling compared to untreated controls. This result suggests that the
dissociation of drug from the second site is more rapid than that from the first site. The
hyper-activation after drug wash out is consistent with dissociation of drug from the second
site, resulting in accumulation of the half-bound, transactivated RAF dimer.

Author Manuscript

This was confirmed when A375 (BRAF V600E) and SK-MEL-30 (NRAS Q61K) cells were
treated with 3 μM LGX818 for 1 hr followed by washout of drug and incubation in normal
media. (Figure. 4C) p-ERK was potently inhibited in both cell lines. After wash out, p-ERK
remained inhibited in A375 for up to 24 hr, with a slight increase at that time, consistent
with the very slow off rate from the BRAF V600E monomer. After drug is withdrawn from
SK-MEL-30, which contains WT RAF dimers, p-ERK rises rapidly, reaching a maximum
approximately 1 hr after washout with a half-time of 10 minutes. This is consistent with a
rapid off-rate of drug bound to the second site in the dimer. In these cells, the maximum pERK is about five times higher than basal. After reaching this peak, p-ERK falls slowly,
consistent with the slow off-rate of this drug from the first site in the dimer and is still three
fold elevated compared to basal 24 hr after washout (Figure. 4C).

Thus, after exposure of cells to high concentrations of LGX818, washout of the drug for 1hr
leads to accumulation of activated half-bound dimers. We reasoned that the concentration of
other RAF inhibitors that is required to inhibit ERK signaling in these cells 1 hr after
LGX818 washout reflects the relative affinity of the drug for the second (unoccupied) site.
We used this system to determine the concentrations of six RAF inhibitors that is required to
bind the second site of the dimer when the first is occupied by drug. For each inhibitor, this
value was compared with the concentration at which it inhibits BRAF V600E monomers. 5
of the 6 compounds inhibited ERK phosphorylation in A375 BRAF V600E melanoma cells
at concentrations ranging for 10–100 nM (Figure. S4H–a). This is the concentration required
to inhibit the monomer (or the first site in the dimer.) To determine the concentration of
these drugs required inhibit the second site when the first is bound to drug, SK-MEL-30
NRAS mutant cells were exposed to 1 μM LGX818 for 1 hr after which it was washed out
for 1 hr. Other RAF inhibitors were then added for 1 hr to assess the concentration at which
they inhibit ERK phosphorylation. All the drugs were able to inhibit pERK, but, for 5 of the
6, at concentrations much greater than those at which they inhibit the monomer (0.3–10 μM)
(Figure. S4H–b vs Figure. S4H–a). Only BGB659 inhibited the monomer and the second
site of the WT RAF dimer at approximately the same concentrations. Very similar results
were obtained when the same experiment was done in SK-MEL-239 C4 with BRAF V600E
dimers (p61 BRAF V600E) (Figure. S4H–c). These results are shown graphically (Figure.
S4H–d) and as ratios of concentrations required to inhibit the second site compared to those
that inhibit the monomer (Figure. 4D).

These data suggest that binding of most RAF inhibitors to one site in WT or mutant RAF
dimers substantially reduces their affinity for the second site and that this accounts for the
resistance of dimer driven ERK-signaling to these drugs. However, the binding of BGB659
is unaffected by occupancy of the first site and it inhibits monomers and the second site of
dimers with similar potency (100–300 nM). Our model suggests that such a drug would be
effective in treating tumors in which oncogenic ERK signaling is driven by RAF dimers.

Author Manuscript

In A375, expression of mutant NRAS or overexpression of BRAF V600E caused ERK
signaling to become much less sensitive to RAF monomer selective inhibitors (Figure. 5A
and S5A). By contrast, the concentration at which BGB659 inhibits ERK signaling was
affected only marginally by BRAF V600E overexpression or mutant NRAS expression
(Figure. 5B) and it inhibits ERK signaling in BRAF V600E melanoma SK-MEL-239 and its
resistant counterpart SK-MEL-239 C4 at similar concentrations (Figure. 4B). The effects of
these drugs on cell proliferation are closely correlated with their effects on ERK signaling.
The concentrations of BGB659 that cause inhibition of the proliferation of A375, A375
expressing mutant NRAS or A375 overexpressing BRAF V600E are very similar. (Figure.
S5B) Significantly higher concentrations of the other tested inhibitors were required to
inhibit the proliferation of melanoma cells with any of the three mechanisms of dimerdependent resistance. (Figure. S5B and S5C) Thus, BGB659 effectively inhibits the growth
of melanoma cells in which acquired resistance to vemurafenib is driven by truncated or full
length BRAF V600E dimers.

BGB659 also inhibited ERK signaling driven by RAF mutants that constitutively dimerize.
All such mutants are resistant to inhibition by 1 μM vemurafenib (Figure 2C and Table 1)
but, sensitive to 1 μM BGB659, (seven of eleven mutants tested are shown in Figure. 5C).
BGB659 also inhibits ERK signaling driven by activated RAF fusion proteins (KIA1549BRAF and ESRP1-CRAF) and truncations (p61 or Cat C) that constitutively dimerize
(Figure. 5C). BGB659 effectively inhibits ERK signaling and the proliferation of JVM-3, a
BRAF K601N CLL cell line that is resistant to vemurafenib (Figure. S5D and S5E). Thus,
BGB659 inhibits ERK signaling driven by both oncogenic RAF monomers and dimers and
inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells harboring these RAF mutants.
BGB659 preferentially inhibits mutant RAF-driven ERK signaling

Author Manuscript

An inhibitor of mutant and WT RAF dimers would inhibit ERK in normal cells and would
have a narrow therapeutic index, as do MEK inhibitors. We compared the effects of BGB659
on signaling driven by WT dimers and mutant RAF dimers in NIH3T3 cells in which a
variety of RAS or RAF were expressed in an inducible manner. The IC50s for BGB659
inhibition of ERK signaling driven by BRAF V600E monomers or three different mutant
BRAF constitutive dimers were very similar and more than an order of magnitude lower
than those required to inhibit signaling in cells in which WT BRAF or NRAS or NRAS
Q61K were overexpressed (Figure. S6A). The data suggest that BGB659 does not inhibit all
RAF dimers equally; BRAF mutant monomers and dimers are more sensitive than RAS
driven WT dimers. In contrast, after 1 hr of exposure, the MEK inhibitor, trametinib inhibits

ERK phosphorylation at similar doses whether it is driven by WT RAF or mutant BRAF
(Figure. S6B)

Author Manuscript

This was also the case in tumor cell lines in which ERK is activated by different upstream
mechanisms (Figure 6A), including mutant BRAF V600E (A375 melanoma), A375 in which
NRAS Q61K is expressed, mutant NRAS Q61R (SK-MEL-2 melanoma), mutant KRAS
G12S (A549 lung cancer), and HER2-activated wild type RAS (SKBR3 breast cancer).
BGB659 inhibits ERK signaling at almost identical concentrations in A375 and in A375 in
which mutant NRAS has been overexpressed (IC50s ~ 100–300 nM, almost complete
inhibition at 1 μM). In contrast, in the other three cell lines, ERK phosphorylation increased
after exposure to relatively low doses of the drug, with maxima occurring at 50–100 nM and
declined at higher concentrations. In SKBR3 and SK-MEL-2, ERK phosphorylation
declined 40% with 1 μM BGB659 and only approached complete inhibition at 10 μM. In
A549 mutant KRAS cells, ERK declined to pretreatment levels at 1 μM drug and some
residual activity remained at 10 μM. Thus, tumor cells with mutant RAF, with or without
coexistent RAS mutation are most sensitive to BGB659. In cells in which ERK is driven by
WT RAF (SK-MEL-2, A549, SKBR3), the effect of the drug varied with concentration in a
biphasic manner, with ERK phosphorylation enhanced at low doses and inhibited at higher
doses. The effects of BGB659 on tumor cell proliferation correlated with its effects on
signaling.(Figure S6C) All 15 tumor cell lines with mutant BRAF were sensitive to the drug
(9 with BRAF V600E, one with BRAF V600K, four with RAF mutants that constitutively
dimerize, and one with p61 BRAF V600E) with IC50s from 100 nM to 600 nM. By contrast,
the ten tumor cell lines with RAS mutation and fourteen with WT RAS and RAF were 10- to
more than 50-fold less sensitive than the mutant RAF tumors.

A biphasic dose response is also observed when normal or tumor cells with activated RAS
are treated with previously reported RAF inhibitors (Poulikakos et al., 2010). This
phenomenon has been shown to result from both induction of RAF dimerization by the drug
and its transactivation of RAF dimers (Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010; Lavoie et al., 2013;
Poulikakos et al., 2010). BGB659 inhibits the second site of activated RAF dimers in cells
with mutant NRAS with the same potency as it inhibits BRAF V600E monomers (Figure.
S4H–a and -b). We therefore asked whether its differential effects on mutant and WT RAF
dimers are due to differential induction of dimerization. BGB659 and other RAF inhibitors
caused marked, dose-dependent induction of BRAF/CRAF heterodimers in HeLa and in two
melanoma cell lines with mutant NRAS, but not in A375 (BRAF V600E) (Figure 6B).
Induction by BGB659, and the RAF monomer inhibitors LGX 818 and dabrafenib was
equivalent and much greater than that caused by vemurafenib (Figure. 6B). Since
physiologic dimerization of RAF is RAS dependent and RAS-GTP levels are inhibited by
feedback in A375, we asked whether induction of dimerization was RAS dependent. In
SKBR3 cells, RAS-GTP levels and induction of BRAF/CRAF heterodimers by BGB659
were both inhibited in a dose dependent fashion by lapatinib and correlated closely with
each other (Figure 6C.) These data suggest that induction of dimerization is RAS dependent
and does not occur in cells with activating RAF mutations because their RAS-GTP levels are
low.

In support of this model, we examined the ability of BGB659 to induce dimerization of WT
RAF in cells with active RAS-GTP (Figure 6D lanes 1–6). In SKBR3, BGB659 induces WT
BRAF homodimers and BRAF/CRAF heterodimers (Figure 6D lane 4 vs 3, 6 vs 5). Thus, in
cells in which WT RAFs are activated by active RAS, BGB659 both induces the formation
of active RAF dimers and inhibits their activity.

Author Manuscript

By contrast, in cells that express activated RAF mutants, RAS is feedback inhibited and
ERK signaling is RAS-independent. Accordingly, we assessed the effects of BGB659 on
RAF dimerization in lapatinib treated SKBR3 cells engineered to express different RAF
mutants. (Figure 6D, lanes7–12) In BRAF mutant expressing cells, no mutant BRAF/WT
CRAF heterodimers are detected. Significant levels of p61 BRAF (Figure 6D lanes 7 and 8)
and BRAF K601E (Figure 6D lanes 11 and 12) homodimers are expressed in cells in which
either mutant is expressed. In cells in which BRAF V600E is expressed, a low level of
mutant homodimers is observed, (Figure 6D lanes 9 and 10). BGB659 did not induce mutant
RAF homo- or heterodimerization in any of these cells. Thus, BGB659 induces RASdependent dimerization of WT RAF, but, in tumors with mutant RAF, RAS-GTP levels are
too low to support induction of dimerization. Taken together, these data support the
following model. BGB659 inhibits both sites of RAF dimers and also induces RASdependent RAF dimerization. In cells with adequate levels of RAS activation, this accounts
for the biphasic response to increasing concentrations of BGB659. In contrast, in cells with
activating RAF mutants, RAS-GTP is low and the drug inhibits the activity of RAF dimers
without inducing their formation. Tumors with RAF mutants are thus more sensitive to this
drug than those with mutant RAS or normal cells.

The exceptional case that complicates this model are BRAF V600E tumors with acquired
resistance due to mutant NRAS. These tumors are as sensitive to BGB659 as those with
BRAF V600E alone. We asked whether BGB659 affects RAF dimerization in cells with
coexpression of BRAF V600E and mutant NRAS (Figure. S6D). BRAF homodimers and
BRAF/CRAF heterodimers are barely detectable in SKBR3 treated with lapatinib. Coexpression of mutant NRAS with WT RAF significantly increases levels of homo- and
heterodimers and BGB659 further enhances expression of these dimers (Figure. S6D lanes
2–4). When BRAF V600E and WT CRAF are overexpressed in SKBR3, BRAF V600E
homodimers and heterodimers were barely detectable. These dimers were markedly
enhanced when mutant NRAS was coexpressed and further enhanced by BGB659 (Figure.
S6D lanes 6–8). Thus, the drug can induce BRAF V600E dimerization in tumors that coexpress mutant RAS. However, in this case, induction of BRAF V600E dimerization is not
associated with a significant induction of RAF kinase activity (Figure. 6E). Coexpression of
mutant NRAS induces BRAF V600E dimerization (Figure. S6D) it has almost no effect on
elevated RAF kinase activity (Figure. 6E lanes 8–10). This is consistent with our data that
RAF inhibitors do not paradoxically activate p-ERK in such tumors. By contrast, coexpression of WT BRAF or CRAF with mutant NRAS is associated with increase RAF
kinase activity (Figure 6E lanes 2–6). Thus, BGB659 effectively inhibits ERK signaling in
tumors that coexpress BRAF V600E and mutant RAS because in these cells, it induces
BRAF V600E dimerization, but not kinase activation. BGB659 works less well in cells with
active RAS and WT RAF because it increases RAF kinase activity by inducing dimerization.

BGB659 inhibits the in vivo growth of tumors driven by mutant RAF monomer or dimers

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Figure 6 and S6 suggest that BGB659 will inhibit ERK signaling in tumors driven by
activating RAF mutants and fusion proteins more effectively than in normal cells, and could
therefore be useful clinically. We tested whether BGB659 could inhibit the in vivo growth of
SK-MEL-239 C4, cells in which acquired resistance to vemurafenib is mediated by the p61
BRAF V600E dimer. This model and the vemurafenib-sensitive parental SK-MEL-239 cell
line were grown as subcutaneous murine xenografts. 100 mg/kg BGB659 given daily was
unassociated with weight loss or other obvious toxicity. Mice carrying 100 mm3 tumors
were treated daily for 32 days with vehicle, 75 mg/kg vemurafenib or 100 mg/kg BGB659
and then analyzed. Vemurafenib and BGB659 both effectively inhibited the growth of SKMEL-239 tumors, but only the latter had activity against SK-MEL-239 C4 tumors (Figure
7A). Consistently, vemurafenib and BGB659 both potently inhibited ERK signaling in SKMEL-239 tumors but only BGB659 inhibited ERK signaling in SK-MEL-239 C4 tumors
(Figure 7B). These results support the possibility that drugs of this class could be effective in
tumors driven by either mutant RAF monomers or dimers, including those that mediate
acquired resistance to current RAF inhibitors.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Almost two hundred BRAF mutants and many RAF translocations have been identified in
human cancer and many of those have increased catalytic activity (Wan et al., 2004;
Palanisamy et al., 2010). Our work divides the activating mutants into two functional classes
based on the mechanism whereby they achieve RAS-independence. The dimerization of
BRAF V600 mutants remains RAS dependent, but they also signal as RAS-independent
monomers in tumor cells in which RAS is inhibited by feedback. All of the other tested RAF
mutants and fusion proteins signal as RAS-independent constitutive dimers. These data
support the idea that insensitivity to physiologic feedback is a common property of
oncoproteins that is required for their hyperactivation of signaling output.

Author Manuscript

None of the RAF mutants that signal as constitutive dimers are sensitive to previously
reported RAF inhibitor vemurafenib. They only inhibit active RAF monomers, which
comprise all four of the BRAF V600 mutant alleles found in patients. These mutants are
capable of signaling as monomers or RAS-dependent dimers; the feedback inhibition of
RAS by ERK causes BRAF V600 mutants to exist as drug sensitive monomers in these
tumors. Moreover, the three most common causes of acquired resistance of BRAF V600E
melanomas to RAF inhibitors—NRAS mutation, splicing of BRAF V600E that produce a
truncated BRAF kinase, and BRAF V600E overexpression due to gene amplification—all
cause resistance by causing dimerization of BRAF V600E.
The mechanisms underlying the characteristic effects of RAF inhibitors, inhibition of BRAF
V600E monomers, resistance of RAF dimers, and activation of ERK signaling in cells with
active RAS and WT RAF remain controversial. The designation of these drugs as selective
inhibitors of BRAF persists in the medical literature despite evidence to the contrary. They
have been shown to inhibit the kinase activities of all three RAF family members in vitro
and to activate ERK signaling in BRAF knockout cells with active RAS (Poulikakos et al.,
2010). We show here that BRAF mutants that constitutively dimerize are resistant to these

drugs as are V600E dimers in cells with coexistent NRAS mutation or overexpressing
V600E. These drugs would be better described as inhibitors of BRAF monomers. However
why these drugs are poor inhibitors of dimers is poorly understood. Binding of RAF
inhibitors to one protomer in a WT CRAF dimer causes the allosteric transactivation of the
unbound protomer. Most inhibitors also cause RAF to dimerize. Both of these effects play a
role in transactivation, but cannot, by themselves, explain paradoxical activation of WT
dimers or the insensitivity of mutant dimers, since, even if binding of the inhibitor to one
protomer causes the other to adapt an active conformation, the drug ought to bind to the
second site in the dimer with similar potency.

Author Manuscript

The obvious hypothesis is that binding of the drug to one site in the dimer causes an
allosteric effect that reduces its affinity for the second site. We now provide evidence that
this is the case. In isogenic models the concentrations of RAF inhibitor required to inhibit
the monomer were much lower than those required to inhibit the dimer. We take these
findings as reflecting the difference in concentration required to inhibit the first and second
sites of the dimer and therefore demonstrating that negative cooperativity is induced on
occupancy of the first site by the drug. This idea was supported by experiments in which the
off-rate of a RAF inhibitor from the first and second sites of an active WT dimer were
measured in cells and the latter was found to be considerable faster than the former. This
system was used to measure the concentrations at which several RAF inhibitors inhibit the
second site when the first was occupied by the low off-rate drug. In all cases, the
concentration at which the standard RAF inhibitors block signaling driven by the second site
is considerably higher than the concentration required for them to inhibit BRAF V600E
monomers. Taken together, these data suggest that significantly higher concentrations of
RAF inhibitors are required to inhibit dimers than monomers because occupancy of the first
site in the dimer by the drug reduces its affinity for the second site.
Our data suggest that an inhibitor of RAF dimers could be useful for the treatment for many
types of ERK dependent tumor. We identified BGB659 that inhibits BRAF dimers at about
the same concentration as monomers. Moreover, binding of BGB659 to RAF dimers is
unaffected by induction of negative cooperativity by drug occupancy of the first site. As
predicted, BGB659 inhibits ERK signaling driven by both active monomers and
constitutively activated dimers. It also inhibits ERK signaling in models in which acquired
resistance to standard RAF inhibitors is mediated by mutant BRAF dimers. However,
because it also induces the formation of activated WT RAF dimers in cells with active RAS,
it is a much less potent inhibitor of ERK signaling in normal cells and in tumors with RAS
mutation.

Author Manuscript

This work has several important clinical implications. First, it suggests that current RAF
inhibitors will be effective in tumors driven by BRAF V600 mutants and not in those driven
by any of the other, constitutively dimerizing, BRAF mutants or translocations. This must be
a tentative conclusion since we do not understand the structural basis whereby all of these
mutants (including K601E) form constitutive RAS-independent dimers and only BRAF
V600 mutants can signal as either dimers or monomers. Crystal structures have not shed
light on this question, perhaps because they all lack the amino terminal portion of RAF
proteins that is critical in regulating dimerization. We are therefore engaged in characterizing

the RAS- and dimerization dependence of all mutant RAF alleles found in tumors and
determining their sensitivity to inhibitors. Second, we describe herein an algorithm for
assessing the mechanism of action and drug sensitivity of uncharacterized or newly
identified mutations and translocations. Third, BGB659 inhibits ERK signaling driven by
mutant RAF monomers and dimers at doses at which it does not inhibit signaling in normal
cells. These data suggest that this type of drug will have a wide therapeutic index and could
be effective in tumors in which current RAF inhibitors are inactive--tumors driven by nonV600E BRAF mutants, activating RAF dimers encoded by gene translocations, and BRAF
V600E tumors in which acquired resistance to RAF inhibitor is due to dimerization. It is
also possible that such a drug will be superior to currently available RAF inhibitors as an
initial treatment to the tumors driven by BRAF V600E, since they will not be subject to
many of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to those drugs. With the
widespread sequencing of human tumor tissue many such fusion and non-BRAF V600
activating mutants are being discovered and such drugs ought to have wide clinical utility.

Significance
We show here that a fundamental property of activating BRAF mutants is their RAS
independence. The mechanism whereby this occurs determines their sensitivity to current
RAF inhibitors. These drugs potently inhibit signaling driven by active RAF monomers
(BRAF V600) but not dimers. These findings can be use to characterize BRAF mutants
detected in tumors and guide their treatment. A compound that is unaffected by induction
of negative cooperativity inhibits signaling driven by activated mutant BRAF dimers or
monomers and at doses lower than those required to inhibit wild-type RAF signaling.
Such drugs may be useful in treating any tumor driven by an activating BRAF mutation,
and could supplant current ‘BRAF-monomer’ inhibitors which are limited by dimerdriven acquired resistance.
