ABSTRACT
Tumor response to chemotherapy is often limited by drug export through ABC
proteins. To overcome this problem, here we have investigated the usefulness of inducing
the expression of the multidrug uptake transporter OATP1B1 under the control of the
MRP2 promoter (MRP2pr). Human hepatoma cells (Alexander) were transfected with
MRP2pr fragments of different length fused to the firefly luciferase ORF in order to
select the shortest fragment with the highest response to dexamethasone, which was
subsequently used to generate the chimeric construct MRP2pr-OATP1B1-V5. Hepatoma
cells transduced with MRP2pr-OATP1B1-V5 resulted in dexamethasone-sensitive inducible
OATP1B1 expression and enhanced selective antitumor response to OATP1B1 substrates
(paclitaxel, Bamet-R2 and Bamet-UD2). In human colon cancer cells LS174T/R, used as
a model of endogenous chemoresistance due to MRP2 overexpression, MRP2pr-OATP1B1
induced OATP1B1 expression together with chemosensitivity to OATP1B1 substrates.
In nude mice, xenografted tumors formed by LS174T/R cells transduced with MRP2prOATP1B1 plus treatment with dexamethasone were markedly sensitized to Bamet-UD2.
In conclusion, the induced expression of anticancer drug uptake transporters, under
the control of promoters of ABC proteins involved in chemoresistance, constitutes an
interesting approach to overcome the poor response of cancer to chemotherapy due to
reduced drug uptake and/or enhanced drug export.

efficacy of pharmacological approaches is very poor due to
the pre-existence of refractoriness to antitumor drugs and/
or the development of chemoresistance during treatment.
Mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOC) are present
in both cancer cells and healthy tissues, where they
are involved in the defense against the chemical stress
caused by potentially toxic compounds [3]. A group of
MOC, classified as MOC-1b, accounts for the reduction
of intracellular concentrations of the active agent by its
efficient export across the plasma membrane [3]. Several
members of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette

INTRODUCTION
Primary malignancies of the liver and the
gastrointestinal tract constitute one of the most common
causes of death due to cancer worldwide [1]. Although
surgery is the curative therapy of choice, the resection
of these tumors is not always possible, and treatment
often requires the use of alternative therapies. Systemic
chemotherapy is the most common option for treating
advanced disease [2]. Unfortunately, despite the long list
of drugs available for the treatment of these tumors, the

(ABC) proteins play an important role in the multidrugresistance (MDR) phenotype, because they are able
to export a large variety of drugs [4, 5]. Most of these
transporters, such as the multidrug resistance-associated
protein-2 (MRP2, gene symbol ABCC2) are highly
expressed in tumor cells. The overexpression of MRP2
is considered an important mechanism accounting for the
failure of many antitumor drugs commonly used in the
treatment of liver and gastrointestinal cancers [6, 7].
Under physiological conditions, MRP2 is located
at the apical membrane of several types of polarized
cells, where this pump plays a key role in the efflux
and detoxification of endogenous and xenobiotic toxic
compounds [8]. Thus, MRP2 is involved in the elimination
from hepatocytes into bile, from kidney proximal tubule
epithelial cells into urine, and from intestinal epithelial
cells into the intestinal lumen, of a large variety of
molecules, which are for the most part conjugated
with glutathione, sulfate or glucuronic acid [9–11].
Regarding antitumor drugs, MRP2 is able to export
anthracyclines, camptothecins, chlorambucil, cisplatin,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, podophyllotoxins,
tamoxifen, and Vinca alkaloids [6, 12–18]. Interestingly,
MRP2 is up-regulated during treatment with anticancer
agents, some of which, but not all, are substrates of this
pump [19, 20]. The direct consequence is an increase
in the ability of these cells to export these drugs, which
reduces their intracellular accumulation, resulting in the
development of resistance, often cross-resistance, of tumor
cells to chemotherapy [8, 21].
Reduced therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs
can also be due to changes in the expression and/or
activity of the transporters involved in drug uptake,
which have been classified as MOC-1a [3]. The most
important plasma membrane carriers involved in drug
uptake by the liver and gastrointestinal tissues belong
to the family of solute carrier (SLC) proteins [20]. In
neoplastic tissues the expression and/or function of these
proteins can be reduced during tumor development and/
or under anticancer drug pressure. The consequence is
lower intracellular drug concentrations and hence reduced
antitumor activity of these agents in cancer cells. One of
these transporters is OATP1B1 (gene symbol SLCO1B1),
which plays an important role in the hepatic uptake of
anionic antitumor drugs, such as irinotecan [22], paclitaxel
[23] and cytostatic cisplatin-conjugated bile acid
derivatives [24]. Interestingly, the OATP1B1 expression
is decreased in primary liver cancer [21, 25].
Novel approaches are currently being developed to
overcome chemoresistance in liver and gastrointestinal
tumors, especially as this is mainly due to MOC-1a and/
or MOC-1b. These include strategies already used in
clinical practice that involve new drugs with an enhanced
selectivity toward molecular targets, such as inhibitors of
receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (TKIs) or with organ
tropism, such as bile acid-conjugated derivatives. Another

approach, the one being considered in the present study,
is the chemosensitization of cancer cells by enhancing the
intracellular concentration of the active drug through changes
in the expression of uptake transporters. More specifically, as
a proof-of-concept, we have evaluated the possibility of using
gene therapy based on a chimeric construct containing the
ORF of OATP1B1 under the control of the MRP2 promoter
(MRP2pr). The objective was to chemosensitize tumor cells,
with a reduced expression of OATP1B1 (MOC-1a) and a
high expression of MRP2 (MOC-1b), to antitumor drugs
efficiently transported by OATP1B1. The potency of this
strategy can be further enhanced by combination with agents
able to activate MRP2pr, such as dexamethasone [26, 27].
Previous attempts to favor drug uptake in cancer cells have
been done. For instance, with diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes, gene therapy based on the sodium/iodide symporter
(NIS) gene (SLC5A5) has been investigated [28]. The aim
of this approach was to induce NIS expression and hence
increase radiolabeled iodide accumulation in cancer cells
[28]. This has been assayed in several types of cancer
including hepatocellular carcinoma [29]. Tissue specificity
has been further improved by using promoters of cell-specific
genes such as alpha-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma
[29], prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer
[30], and glial fibrillary acidic protein in glioma [31].

RESULTS
Selection of the MRP2 promoter fragment
In order to identify the region of the MRP2pr
with the shortest size but the highest activating ability,
several fragments (Z1-, Z2- and Z3-MRP2pr) of different
length located 5’-upstream of the MRP2 transcription
start site were investigated. In addition, we determined
their ability to respond to the well-known MRP2
inductor dexamethasone, which mediates the induction
of the transcription process through the activation of
glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) previously
identified in the MRP2pr (Figure 1A) [26, 27]. The
MRP2pr fragments were previously cloned into plasmids
to drive the expression of 3’-downstream located firefly
luciferase (Luc2) [19]. Transfection of Alexander cells
with vectors containing MRP2pr fragments fused to Luc2
and their treatment with dexamethasone were carried out
as indicated in Figure 1B. Transfection of Alexander cells
with a similar but promoter-less construct showed poor
luciferase activity (Figure 1C). In contrast, all MRP2pr
fragments markedly stimulated the luciferase activity.
The efficacy was different among them and lower than
that of the positive control cytomegalovirus promoter
(CMVpr)-Luc2. The order of transcriptional activity
was CMV>Z3≈Z1>Z2 (Figure 1C). Dexamethasone
stimulated Z1-MRP2pr activity in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 1D). Based on these results,
100 nM dexamethasone was used in further in vitro

The fragments of MRP2pr that preceded Luc2 showed
different ability to respond to dexamethasone-induced
luciferase activity (Figure 1C). Based on the results
obtained in these experiments, Z3-MRP2pr was selected
as the shortest fragment with the highest promoter
activity. Accordingly, for the sake of clarity, Z3-MRP2pr

stop codon. After transfection, OATP1B1 mRNA levels
increased and peaked at 48 h (Figure 2A). Afterward,
mRNA levels progressively decreased and returned to
negligible basal values at approximately 5 days after
transfection. Treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM,
from 48 h) significantly increased OATP1B1 expression,
which remained during 4 days after transfection at levels
higher than 50% of those detected in the control liver
(Figure  2A). Western blot analysis confirmed that the
increased expression resulted in higher abundance of
OATP1B1 protein. This was further enhanced by treatment
with dexamethasone. Alexander cells transfected with a
CMV-CAT-V5 plasmid were used as a positive control
(Figure 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that
the detection of V5 in cells transfected with CMV-CAT-V5
plasmid was intracellular whereas when V5 was fused to
OATP1B1 most of the fluorescent signal was located at the
plasma membrane (Figure 2C).

enhance OATP1B1 expression in an in vitro model of
tumor cells with endogenous chemoresistance, LS174T

OATP1B1 expression under the control of MRP2
promoter
Subsequent experiments were carried out to induce
overexpression of OATP1B1, whose down-regulation in
liver cancer cells constitutes an important limitation for
the uptake and effectiveness of several antitumor drugs
[22, 23]. Plasmids carrying the OATP1B1 ORF under
the control of MRP2pr were transiently transfected into
Alexander cells, which have negligible endogenous
expression of OATP1B1. To easily follow the expression
and subcellular localization of this protein, the V5 epitope
was included in the 5’-end of the construct before the

OATP1B1 expression induced enhanced
sensitivity to anticancer drugs

and its derived chemoresistant subline LS174T/R
were transiently transfected with the construct. This
transfection induced moderate OATP1B1 expression in
LS174T cells, consistent with low MRP2 expression
in these cells [19]. In contrast, OATP1B1 was highly
expressed in LS174T/R cells (Figure 2D), which are
characterized by high MRP2 expression [19]. Similar
to that described above for Alexander cells, the highest
levels of OATP1B1 mRNA in LS174T/R cells were
detected 48 h after transfection. In these cells, OATP1B1
protein was also localized at the plasma membrane
(Figure 2C).

To evaluate the ability of the chimeric construct to
sensitize cancer cells to cytostatic OATP1B1 substrates,
a dose-dependent study was carried out in Alexander
cells incubated with the desired antitumor drug from
48 h after the transiently transfection (Figure 3), based
on the results obtained in the time-course of OATP1B1
expression described above (Figure 2A). OATP1B1
expression had no effect on the sensitivity of Alexander
cells to cisplatin, (Figure 3A), which is not transported by

containing the V5-tagged ORF of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) under the control of CMV promoter was used. An empty
vector (Mock) was used as a negative control. Western blots were carried out with an antibody against the V5 epitope. GAPDH was used

this carrier. In contrast, the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel
(Figure 3B) and two cytostatic bile acid derivatives, i.e.,
Bamet-R2 (Figure 3C) and Bamet-UD2 (Figure 3D),
was enhanced by OATP1B1 expression. The sensitivity
to these drugs was further increased by treatment with
dexamethasone. Thus, under these conditions, a marked
reduction in IC50 values for paclitaxel (2.7-fold),
Bamet-R2 and Bamet-UD2 (both ~5-fold) was found
(Figure 3, insets). In contrast, the antitumor effect of
these drugs was not enhanced by dexamethasone in cells
that were transfected with the empty vector (Mock). The
chemosensitizing ability of this strategy was confirmed in
an in vitro model of stable overexpression of OATP1B1
using lentiviral vectors (Figure 4A). In stably transduced
cells, neither OATP1B1 expression nor dexamethasone
treatment affected the sensitivity to cisplatin (Figure 4B).
In contrast, the maintained overexpression of OATP1B1
was able to induce enhanced sensitivity of Alexander cells

to Bamet-UD2 (Figure 4C) and paclitaxel (Figure 4D).
The effect of Bamet-UD2 in cells expressing OATP1B1
was so strong that there was no room for improvement by
further increasing OATP1B1 by dexamethasone treatment.
In contrast, although the effect of paclitaxel was improved
by OATP1B1 expression, this could be further enhanced
by dexamethasone-dependent OATP1B1 up-regulation.
The ability of this chemosensitizing strategy to
overcome endogenous chemoresistance was evaluated
using paired wild-type (LS174T) and chemoresistant
(LS174T/R) cells as a model of stable overexpression
of OATP1B1 using lentiviral vectors (Figure 5). In
chemosensitive LS174T cells, transduction with the
chimeric construct was not associated with a higher
sensitivity to cytostatic OATP1B1 substrates (Figure
5C and 5E). In LS174T/R cells, no difference between
transduction with Mock and OATP1B1-bearing lentiviral
vectors was found when these cells were treated with

(Figure 5B). In contrast, stable expression of OATP1B1
increased the sensitivity of LS174T/R cells to Bamet-UD2
(Figure 5D) and paclitaxel (Figure 5F). This effect was
enhanced by combined incubation with dexamethasone.

due to the insertion of the gene in an interfering site of
the genome or to enhanced sensitivity to inhibitory
environmental factors is an interesting question that
must be addressed in further investigations. In the
absence of chemosensitization, Bamet-UD2 had only a
moderate effect on tumor growth. In contrast, in tumors
overexpressing OATP1B1, the antitumor effect of BametUD2 was significantly enhanced (Figure 6B).

Experiments in the mouse xenograft model
We have previously shown the ability of BametUD2 to inhibit the growth of tumors formed by LS174T
cells in vivo [32]. Here we have evaluated the usefulness
of chemosensitizing the chemoresistant subline LS174T/R
to Bamet-UD2 by overexpressing OATP1B1 under the
control of MRP2pr, which was further stimulated by
treatment with dexamethasone. To reduce the number
of animals to be used in this phase of the study, we have
assayed only the strongest chemosensitizing strategy,
based on results obtained from the in vitro phase. We have
observed that the monoclonal subline of LS174T/R cells
overexpressing OATP1B1 showed, on its own, slower
growth rate in vitro (Figure 6A) and in vivo (Figure 6B)
than the parental line. Whether mild tumor-suppressor

DISCUSSION
The limited success of available treatments for
gastrointestinal and liver cancer makes the development
of more efficient therapeutic approaches both necessary
and urgent. Gene therapy has emerged as an alternative
to conventional treatments. One of the major obstacles
for the use of gene therapy is the specific targeting of
transgene expression to the site of the tumor. Numerous
gene therapy strategies have used nonspecific and
nonselective promoters that can be expressed at high
levels even in healthy cells, potentially contributing to
toxicity. For cancer treatment a better strategy would be

the use of tissue and/or cancer-specific promoters to limit
the expression of therapeutic genes in the desired target
cells [33, 34].

Under physiological circumstances, MRP2 is
normally expressed in liver, intestine and kidney [35–37],
however this pump is frequently overexpressed in

tumor cells derived from these and other tissues. MRP2
expression is further stimulated in response to many
structurally different chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, the
MOC-1b accounted for by MRP2-mediated drug efflux
is considered an important cause of the poor response
to anticancer chemotherapy [7, 21, 38]. Based on this
common tumor characteristic, the use of the MRP2pr
emerged as a good option for enhancing the efficacy of
gene therapy in these tumors by combining its strong
transcriptional activity with a high degree of specificity.
Moreover, this promoter has two additional advantages:
it is inducible by conventional cancer agents [19] and it
could be further pharmacologically activated, for instance
by co-treatment with dexamethasone.
An important limitation of tissue or cancerspecific promoters is that most of them are much weaker
than commonly used viral promoters such as the SV40
promoter or the CMV promoter. The results obtained in
our study regarding the activity of different fragments
of the MRP2pr showed that, although under basal
conditions their activity in human hepatoma cells was
lower than those observed for the constitutive CMV
promoter, they present, in contrast to CMV, the ability to
respond to pharmacological activation, for instance with
dexamethasone. Z3-MRP2pr was the fragment of MRP2pr
that showed the strongest response to dexamethasone,
probably because it still contained the majority of GRE,

and lacks inhibitory response elements present in longer
fragments. The selection of this fragment, markedly
shorter than the complete promoter sequence, to drive
the expression of the therapeutic gene will constitute
an advantage in further steps of the development of this
strategy, because size limitation is a common problem in
the design of viral vectors with limited cargo capability,
such as adeno-associated viral vectors. As shown by
our results, the fragment Z3-MRP2pr was efficient in
driving OATP1B1 expression. Moreover, this protein was
correctly targeted at the plasma membrane of hepatoma
cells, resulting in enhanced selective sensitivity to
antitumor OATP1B1 substrates, such as paclitaxel and
cisplatin-bile acid conjugates (Bamet-R2 and BametUD2). This has important pharmacological implications
because the frequent loss of OATP1B1 expression in liver
cancer [21, 25] markedly limits the antitumor drug uptake
[22, 23].
Although ABCC2 is poorly expressed in healthy
colorectal epithelium [39], the expression of this pump is
significantly elevated in colorectal adenocarcinoma [7].
This partly accounts for the high resistance to platinum
derivatives currently used for the treatment of these
tumors in combination with other drugs [40, 41]. The
experiments performed here using human colon cancer
cells have demonstrated that our therapeutic construct is
able to induce higher sensitivity to OATP1B1 antitumor

substrates, which occurs specifically in colon cancer cells
that overexpress MRP2. Moreover, further activation of
MRP2pr by dexamethasone dramatically increased the
sensitivity of the chemoresistant cells to paclitaxel and
cytostatic bile acid derivatives.
Treatment of colon cancer cells with cisplatin
stimulates the development of MDR phenotype, which
is characterized by the up-regulation of several ABC
proteins, in particular MRP2 [19]. This supports the
hypothesis that gene therapy based on the strategy
evaluated here may benefit patients that have developed
drug resistance during treatment mainly due to enhanced
drug export. Furthermore, the low expression of MRP2
in healthy colon tissue suggests that the activation of the
MRP2pr will be selective for cancer cells and hence its
use in gene therapy will not increase drug toxicity on
healthy colon tissue. In other organs, such as liver and
kidney, the up-regulation of OATP1B1 may favor drug
uptake. Whether this may affect the pharmacokinetics
of the drug or a selective enhancement in hepatotoxicity
and nephrotoxicity are interesting questions that deserve
further evaluation after this proof-of-concept study.
Potential limitations and difficulties to use this strategy
in clinic include the selection of appropriate vector and
the need of approved antitumor drugs with substrate
specificity for OATP1B1. Moreover, the success requires
up-regulation of MRP2, thus in tumors overexpressing
other ABC proteins, the promoter used in the construct
should be selected after the identification of ABC
profile in each individual case. Finally, it is possible that
chemosensitized tumors develop alternative ways of
chemoresistance during treatment, which would require
dynamic adaptation to the evolution of the target tumor
characteristics.
In conclusion, the enhanced expression of anticancer
drug uptake transporters, such as OATP1B1, under
the control of promoters of ABC proteins involved in
chemoresistance, such as MRP2, constitutes an interesting
approach to overcome the poor response to chemotherapy
due to reduced drug uptake and enhanced drug export.

overexpressing MRP2 were previously obtained and
characterized as reported [19].

OATP1B1 cloning into expression vectors
The human OATP1B1 ORF was ampliﬁed from total
RNA isolated from healthy liver by reverse transcription
followed by high-ﬁdelity PCR using the AccuPrime Pfx
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Madrid) and speciﬁc primers containing the appropriate
attB adapters (Supplementary Table 1). The attB-flanked
PCR product was recombined with a pDONR221 vector
(Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate a pEntry
plasmid. This was simultaneously recombined with another
pEntry plasmid containing one of the MRP2pr fragments
previously obtained [19], and a promoter-less destination
vector (pcDNA6.2-V5pL or pWPIpL-DEST) by Multisite
Gateway® cloning (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
to obtain the desired expression vectors (Supplementary
Figure 1). A promoter-less lentiviral destination vector
(pWPIpL) was previously obtained by removing the
EF1a promoter from the pWPI vector using high-ﬁdelity
PCR with the AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase and
speciﬁc primers (Supplementary Table 1). The exact
nucleotide sequence of all constructs was confirmed
by gel-electrophoresis-based sequencing. Recombinant
lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T cells transfected
using a standard polyethylenimine (PEI) protocol with the
transfer vector pWPI-Z3-MRP2pr-OATP1B1, encoding
both OATP1B1 and the enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) or simply pWPI (to generate “Mock vectors”),
and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G. Viral
titers were determined by infection of HEK293T cells
with serial dilutions of the viral solution, and the analysis
of EGFP-positive cells was carried out 4 days later
with a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
Madrid). Lentiviral vectors were added to target cells at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 infectious particles
per cell in the presence of polybrene, and the infected cells
were tested by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Figure
2A) and by ﬂuorescence microscopy (Supplementary
Figures 2B and 2C). Monoclonal stably expressing
sublines were obtained by using the limiting dilution
method (Supplementary Figure 2D). The ability of
infected cells to respond to dexamethasone was indirectly
determined by analyzing, using flow cytometry, the
fluorescence due to EGFP. The clone with the highest
response to dexamethasone was selected for further studies
(Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and cells
Cisplatin, dexamethasone and paclitaxel were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). According
to the suppliers, the purity of these compounds was
≥97%. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.
Synthesis, structure and chemical characteristics of bile
acid derivatives Bamet-R2 and Bamet-UD2 (90% pure
as determined by platinum absorption spectrometry)
have been previously described [42, 43]. Alexander or
PCL/PRF/5 (human hepatoma), LS174T (human colon
adenocarcinoma) and HEK293T (human embryonic
kidney) cells were obtained from the American Type
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Reporter gene assays
Alexander cells were transiently transfected with
firefly luciferase (Luc2) fusion plasmids by using a
34625

Oncotarget

lipofectamine LTX/PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), and
cultured for 72 h before measuring promoter activation
(Figure 1B), which was carried out by determining
changes in luciferase activity. The expression of Luc2 was
enzymatically determined by measuring the light generated
in the presence of the substrate luciferin using the BrightGlo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madrid) in a LAS4000 image reader (FujiFilm TDI, Madrid). The results
were expressed as relative units of light (arbitrary light
units/min) corrected by the amount of living cells in each
well. In some cases, 48 h after transfection, the cells were
incubated with different concentrations of dexamethasone
for 24 h before measuring luciferase activity (Figure 1B).

(≈5000 cells/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates. In
the case of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+)
or Z3-MRP2pr-OATP1B1-V5 plasmids, transfection was
carried out 24 h after seeding and, 48 h later, the cells
were incubated with the desired compound for 72 h. In the
case of cell transduced with lentiviral vectors, 24 h after
seeding, the cells were exposed to the desired compound
in the presence or the absence of 100 nM dexamethasone
for 72 h (Figure 4A). Cell viability was determined with
the MTT test (Sigma).

In vivo experiments
Eight weeks old female nude mice (Swiss nu/
nu) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
(Barcelona) and were maintained under pathogen-free
conditions and handled under stringent sterile conditions.
The animals were fed on standard mouse chow (Panlab,
Madrid) and water ad libitum. Temperature (20°C) and
the light/dark cycle (12 h:12 h) were controlled and the
protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the
University of Salamanca. To study antitumor activity in
vivo, nude mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and
1x107 LS174T/R cells stably expressing OATP1B1 or
transduced with pWPI vector (Mock), were suspended in
100 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and subcutaneously
injected in the mouse flank. When the tumors reached a
size of ≈0.5 cm in diameter (volume≈0.06 cm3), the animals
were randomly divided into two groups that received
Bamet-UD2 plus dexamethasone, or the vehicle alone
(sterile saline) on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 and
31 after implanting the cells. The dose of Bamet-UD2 (15
nmol/g b.w., i.p.) was selected based on previous studies
that demonstrated the antitumor effect of this compound
in vivo without any detectable toxic side effect [44]. The
selection of the dose of dexamethasone (1.3 nmol/g b.w.,
i.p.) was based on recent studies by our group on the dosedependent hepatotoxicity of this glucocorticoid in mice
[45]. Animals were monitored daily and tumors were
measured twice per week with a sliding caliper to calculate
the volume using the formula (length × width2)/2. The
animals were euthanized by anesthesia overdose when the
tumor volume reached an excessive volume that limited
their movements and access to food and water.

Determination of OATP1B1 mRNA levels
DNA synthesized from total RNA by reverse
transcription (RT) was used as a template to determine
OATP1B1 expression by real-time quantitative PCR
(QPCR) using gene-specific primers spanning the exon-exon
junctions in the target mRNA (Supplementary Table 1) and
AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase in a 7300 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
thermal cycling conditions were as follows: single cycles
at 50ºC for 2 min and at 95ºC for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles at 95ºC for 15 s and at 60ºC for 60 s. Detection of the
amplification products was carried out using SYBR Green
I. The mRNA abundance of OATP1B1 in each sample was
normalized on the basis of its GAPDH content.

Western blot
Immunoblotting analyses of cell lysates were
carried out in 7.5% SDS-PAGE, loading 100 μg of protein
per lane. Blots were probed with primary monoclonal
antibodies against V5 (Invitrogen), and GAPDH (clone
6C5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
Horseradish peroxidase-linked chicken anti-mouse
secondary antibody was from Invitrogen. An enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Hybond ECL; GE
Healthcare, Barcelona) was used to visualize the bands.

Immunoﬂuorescence analyses
Immunostaining was carried out in air-dried cells
grown on coverslips, which were ﬁxed and permeabilized
with ice-cold methanol. The primary V5 antibody was
diluted 1:800 in 5% fetal calf serum in PBS. The secondary
Alexa Fluor-488 antibody (Life Technologies, Madrid) was
diluted 1:1000. Nuclei were counterstained with 10 μM
4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence staining
was visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope.

Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean±SD. Using IBM SPSS
Statistics V20 for Mac, paired or unpaired Student t-test,
or the Bonferroni method of multiple-range testing were
used as appropriate as post hoc procedure to calculate the
statistical signiﬁcance of differences among groups.
