ABSTRACT
In order to protect the brain before an irreversible injury occurs, penumbral
oxygenation is the primary goal of current acute ischemic stroke treatment. However,
hyperoxia treatment remains controversial due to the risk of free radical generation
and vasoconstriction. Melatonin is a highly potent free radical scavenger that protects
against ischemic stroke. Considering its anti-oxidant activity, we hypothesized that
melatonin may augment the survival-promoting action of normobaric oxygen (NBO)
and prevent brain infarction. Herein, we exposed mice to 30 or 90 min of intraluminal
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and evaluated the effects of NBO (70% or
100% over 90 min), administered either alone or in combination with melatonin (4
mg/kg, i.p.), on disseminate neuronal injury, neurological deficits, infarct volume,
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cell signaling.
Both NBO and particularly melatonin alone reduced neuronal injury, neurological
deficits, infarct volume and BBB permeability, and increased post-ischemic CBF,
evaluated by laser speckle imaging (LSI). They also improved CBF significantly in the
ischemic- core and penumbra, which was associated with reduced IgG extravasation,
DNA fragmentation, infarct volume, brain swelling and neurological scores. Levels of
phosphorylated Akt, anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, pro-apoptotic Bax and endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) were re-regulated after combined oxygen and melatonin
delivery, whereas neuronal and inducible NOS, which were increased by oxygen
treatment, were not influenced by melatonin. Our present data suggest that melatonin
and NBO are promising approaches for the treatment of acute-ischemic stroke, which
encourage proof-of-concept studies in human stroke patients.

INTRODUCTION

in disseminate neuronal death or brain infarction [2, 3]. A
major contributor to ischemic reperfusion injury is reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which are formed in response
to tissue re-oxygenation and promote inflammatory
responses that activate neuronal apoptosis [4].
Exposure to normobaric oxygen (NBO) is a simple,
inexpensive and easy-to-access strategy that allows
to enhance tissue re-oxygenation even in the hands of
paramedics in ischemic stroke. Studies in rats using
electron paramagnetic resonance-guided oxymetry have

Rapid post-ischemic reperfusion, initiated either
by tissue-plaminogen activator-induced thrombolysis
or interventional clot removal, is critical for successful
neurological recovery following ischemic stroke [1].
Rapid reperfusion is a sine qua non condition for postischemic tissue survival, while in non-reperfused tissue or
in tissue that is reperfused with delay, depending on the
duration of ischemia secondary brain damage may result

shown that penumbral partial oxygen pressure (pO2),
which decreases to ≈30% of pre-ischemic levels after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), is doubled
when 95% oxygen is administered in the ischemic phase
[5].
As a consequence of enhanced tissue oxygenation,
NBO exposure during ischemia reduced ischemic brain
injury, improved neurological function, decreased cerebral
ROS formation and diminished matrix metalloproteinase
and initiator caspase-8 activation in ischemic brain tissue
[5-8]. In contrast, NBO treatment during reperfusion had
no beneficial effect or less significant effect as compared
with NBO treated animals during ischemia [5, 9]. These
findings were interpreted such that ROS formation,
triggers lipid peroxidation and cell membrane damage,
and consequently neuronal death [10].
Melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger with
excellent blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability [1012], which protects against focal cerebral ischemia
in the mouse [13-17] and rat [18-20] by increasing
phosphorylated Akt, increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL,
decreasing pro-apoptotic Bax, decreasing neuronal NO
synthase (nNOS), decreasing inducible NO synthase
(iNOS), increasing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and
decreasing activated caspase-3 proteins.
The combined free radical scavenging and
neuroprotective properties render melatonin particularly
suitable for ischemic stroke treatment; supporting
furthermore the hypothesis that melatonin might reverse
possible detrimental effects of NBO after focal cerebral
ischemia. Moreover, the effect of NBO on reperfusion
injury and its underlying mechanism, which is an
important concern of clinical studies, is not well studied.
To investigate these, we herein exposed mice to focal
cerebral ischemia induced by 30 or 90 min MCAo,
evaluated the effects of 21, 70 or 100% NBO alone and in
combination with vehicle or melatonin on i) disseminate
neuronal injury assessed by terminal transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL), ii) neurological deficits,
infarct volume, brain swelling and blood-brain barrier
(BBB) permeability, iii) real time semi-quantitative
cerebral blood flow (CBF) examined by laser speckle
imaging (LSI), and iv) the abundance of phosphorylated
Akt, Bcl-xL, Bax, nNOS, iNOS and eNOS proteins in
ischemic brain tissue.

to approximately 15% of pre-ischemic level (Figures
1A, 2A). To determine how NBO exposure influenced
neuronal injury in the presence and absence of melatonin,
we examined mice exposed to 30 min MCAo, which
induces disseminate neuronal injury in the striatum
that predominantly affects small- to medium-sized
interneurons [3, 21]. TUNEL staining revealed that the
delivery of NBO alone or melatonin alone decreased
neuronal injury (Figure 1B). Importantly, disseminate
neuronal injury was more strongly reduced after combined
NBO and melatonin delivery than after delivery of either
NBO or melatonin (Figure 1B), indicating that NBO and
melatonin had synergistic neuroprotective properties.

Effects of NBO and melatonin on neurological
deficits, infarct volume and blood-brain barrier
permeability
Studies in mice exposed to 90 min MCAo, which
induces brain infarction of the striatum and overlying
cortex [22] revealed that NBO alone and melatonin alone
reduced infarct volume, neurological deficits and BBB
permeability; while melatonin alone, but not NBO alone,
decreased brain swelling (Figure 2B-2E). Importantly, the
combined NBO and melatonin delivery did not have any
additive effects on neurological deficits, infarct volume,
brain edema and BBB permeability, neither when 70% nor
100% oxygen was supplied.

Effects of NBO and melatonin on regional
cerebral blood flow
To evaluate the hemodynamic effects induced by
NBO and melatonin, we next analyzed regional CBF in
the ischemic core, the ischemic penumbra and ipsilateral
non-ischemic tissue by LSI. For this study, we examined
mice exposed to 90 min MCAo, which - unlike shorterlasting ischemia - is followed by secondary hypoperfusion
that develops within 90 min after reperfusion onset [23].
Notably, both NBO alone and melatonin alone increased
regional CBF above the ischemic core and penumbra
(Figure 3A-3D). Thus, regional CBF in mice receiving
NBO and melatonin was very similar to mice receiving
NBO only.

To characterize the effects of NBO and melatonin

abundance in ischemic tissue samples from mice exposed

melatonin alone increased the levels of phosphorylated
(i.e., activated) Akt and Bcl-xL proteins, while the level

of total (i.e., phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated)
Akt remained unchanged (Figure 4A, 4B). Besides, NBO
but not melatonin reduced the level of pro-apoptotic
Bax protein (Figure 4C). Interestingly, the levels of
phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-xL were highest, while the
level of Bax was lowest in mice receiving NBO combined
with melatonin (Figure 4A-4C). Levels of nNOS and
iNOS, which are both associated with oxidative stress,

were dose-dependently increased by NBO (Figure
4D, 4E). Notably, nNOS and iNOS levels were not
influenced by melatonin, neither when applied alone, nor
in combination with NBO (Figure 4D, 4E). On the other
hand, eNOS level was neither influenced by NBO alone,
nor melatonin alone, but was significantly increased after
combined NBO and melatonin delivery (Figure 4F).

comprehensive studies focusing on reperfusion injury, and
underlying mechanism, and the risk of enhanced overproduction of ROS. In this context, we have examined
the effect of NBO treatment alone or in combination with
melatonin after focal cerebral ischemia. For this aim, a
total of three sets of experiments were designed. Animals
were treated with 21, 70 and 100% NBO in combination

Hopes have emerged from hitherto performed
studies that
NBO and melatonin are promising
approaches for the treatment of acute-ischemic stroke.
However, at least in theoretical aspect, hyperoxia has been
criticized and remains controversial owing to the lack of

(4 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered after reperfusion onset, and regional CBF was recorded over 90 min starting 1 min after
reperfusion. Regional CBF values (in arbitrary units) were measured in the beginning and end of the recording phase. From these values,
relative changes were determined for each region of interest, which were normalized with values determined in mice receiving 21% NBO
combined with vehicle (set as 100%). Note that regional CBF, which is markedly increased by NBO above the ischemic core and penumbra
B., C., does not further rise in mice exposed to NBO plus melatonin. Data are mean ± SD values (n = 4 mice/ group). **p < 0.01/ *p < 0.05

apoptotic key factor Bax, and survival kinase AKT, which
play significant roles in the pathology of ischemic brain
injury.
Herein, we show that combined NBO and melatonin
delivery synergistically reduces disseminate neuronal
injury after mild focal cerebral ischemia induced by 30
min MCAo. Both NBO and particularly melatonin alone
reduced neuronal injury, neurological deficits, infarct
volume and BBB permeability, and increased postischemic cerebral blood flow evaluated by LSI after
90 min of MCAo. Levels of phosphorylated Akt, antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, pro-apoptotic Bax and endothelial
NO synthase were re-regulated after combined NBO
and melatonin delivery, whereas levels of neuronal and
inducible NO synthase, which were increased by NBO,
were not influenced by melatonin.
Tissue re-oxygenation is critical for the survival of
ischemic tissue, and NBO is highly efficient in reversing
interstitial pO2 deficits. Thus, NBO administered during
focal cerebral ischemia was able to maintain penumbral
interstitial pO2 close to the pre-ischemic values, whereas
NBO delivery during reperfusion still doubled penumbral
pO2 that was otherwise reduced to ≈30% [5]. Yet, the
therapeutic utility of NBO remained controversial, since
NBO delivered during ischemia [5, 7, 8] but not reperfusion
[5, 9], was found to decrease infarct volume and improve
neurological deficits. The lack of therapeutical effects has
been attributed to increased ROS formation triggering
lipid peroxidation, membrane damage and neuronal death
[10]. In our present study, we evaluated the favorable or
unfavorable effect of NBO treatment on reperfusion injury
thoroughly by using two different MCAo models (30 or
90 minute-durations). Notably, we have not observed any
unfavorable effects of NBO treatment on the reperfusion
injury as compared with normoxia, which was 21% of
O2 inhalation. It is noteworthy that tissue survival was
improved progressively when animals were treated with
increased concentration of NBO. However, melatonin
treatment alone was more efficacious as compared with
NBO treatment at all concentrations studied. Furthermore,
melatonin potentiated the protective effect of NBO
treatment significantly, evaluated by infarct volume,
brain swelling, neurological deficit score and DNA
fragmentation.
In the human vascular system, it was revealed that
100% O2 treatment causes vasoconstriction and reduces
CBF around 20% in healthy subjects [24]. However, in
a pre-clinical stroke study, it was shown that hyperoxia
preserves CBF in both core and penumbra, when NBO
was applied during focal cerebral ischemia [7]. In the case
of melatonin, diverse effects of melatonin’s MT1 and MT2
receptors on CBF have been reported [25]. However, in
our recent study, we observed that melatonin improves
CBF under ischemic stroke conditions by inhibiting
ECE-1 [14, 17, 20] Furthermore, we revealed that the
beneficial effect of melatonin on CBF was independent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from MT1 and MT2 receptors [14]. However in these
studies CBF analysis were conducted by LDF using
a flexible optic probe, which was attached to the intact
skull overlying the MCA territory. LDF does not provide
precise measurements of absolute regional CBF values;
it provides noninvasive, instantaneous, and continuous
measurement of microcirculatory blood flow in a small
tissue sample [26]. Therefore, it remained a matter of
further research using a more precise CBF analysis
method that allows spatial resolution. Therefore, in the
present study, we used LSI for the analysis of CBF on the
ischemic core, penumbra and non-ischemic brain tissue.
We have observed that both melatonin and NBO treatment
improved CBF significantly. In addition, the effects of
melatonin and NBO treatment on the BBB permeability
were evaluated by IgG extravasation analysis. Consistent
with brain swelling, it was observed that both NBO
and especially melatonin reduced BBB permeability
significantly.
In line with the observation that combined NBO
and melatonin delivery reduced disseminate neuronal
injury, levels of phosphorylated Akt, anti-apoptotic BclxL, pro-apoptotic Bax and eNOS were re-regulated upon
combined NBO and melatonin delivery. Thus, levels of
phosphorylated Akt, Bcl-xL and eNOS were increased,
whereas the level of Bax was reduced, as revealed in
Western blots. On the other hand, nNOS and iNOS
activities were increased by NBO, but not influenced
by melatonin. It has been previously reported that BclxL is upregulated and Bax is downregulated by NBO
after intraluminal MCAo in rats [27]. Upregulation
of phosphorylated Akt, Bcl-xL and eNOS and
downregulation of Bax, nNOS and iNOS by melatonin
have been described after intraluminal MCAo in mice [14,
16, 17] or in rats [19]. Production of ROS, nitric oxide,
nNOS and iNOS contribute to lipid peroxidation and
cellular energy failure [28].
In conclusion, both NBO and melatonin
synergistically improved CBF significantly in the
ischemic- core and penumbra analyzed by real-time laser
speckle imaging, which was associated with reduced IgG
extravasation, DNA fragmentation, infarct volume, brain
swelling and neurological scores which was associated
with decreased activity of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and
increased activities of NOSs, anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and
survival kinase Akt. Our study suggests the utility of NBO
as add-on treatment to free radical scavenging drugs.

5% ethanol) were intraperitoneally administered. During
NBO exposure, internal pressure of the chamber was
continuously observed with a monometer and the internal
oxygen concentration was controlled with an oxygen
sensor (MX-300; Teledyne Analytical Instruments).
Thereafter, mice were placed back into their home cages.
In mice exposed to 90 min MCAo, neurological
deficits were evaluated 24 hours after MCAo using the
following 5-point score: 0 = normal function; 1 = flexion
of torso and of the contralateral forelimb upon lifting of the
animal by the tail; 2 = circling to the contralateral side but
normal posture at rest; 3 = reclination to the contralateral
side at rest; 4 = absence of spontaneous motor activity.
At 24 hours (for 90 min MCAo) or 72 hours (for 30 min
MCAo) after reperfusion, mice were sacrificed under
deep anesthesia (4% isofluorane with 30% O2, remainder
N2O). Brains were removed, frozen on dry ice and cut
on a cryostat into coronal 18-µm sections, which were
subsequently used for the analysis of disseminate neuronal
injury, infarct volume, serum IgG extravasation and brain
swelling. From the same mice, tissue samples obtained
from the striatum ipsilateral and contralateral to the stroke
were pooled for Western blots.

Experimental groups
Experiments were performed using male Balb/c
mice (22-25 g). A total of three sets of mice were
examined, which were randomly treated with 21%, 70%
or 100% NBO during reperfusion with intraperitoneal
delivery of vehicle (50 µl isotonic saline/ 5% ethanol) or
melatonin (4 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.9% isotonic saline/ 5%
ethanol) at the moment of reperfusion onset.
In the first set, mice were exposed to 30 min of
focal cerebral ischemia followed by 72 hours reperfusion.
These mice were used for the evaluation of disseminate
ischemic injury in the striatum (n = 7-8/ per group). The
second set of mice was exposed to 90 min of focal cerebral
ischemia followed by 24 hours reperfusion for the analysis
of infarct volume, IgG extravasation, brain swelling and
cell signaling pathways (n = 7-8/ per group). The third set
was exposed to 90 min of focal cerebral ischemia followed
by real-time evaluation of CBF by LSI during the first 90
min after reperfusion onset (n = 4/ per group).

Laser speckle imaging

Animal surgery

Mice were anesthetized with 1% isofluorane
(30% O2, remainder N2O) and placed in a stereotactic
frame (World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany).
Throughout the experimental procedure, rectal
temperature was maintained between 36.5 and 37.0°C
using a feedback-controlled heating system. A midline
incision was made in the scalp and the skull surface was
cleaned with sterile normal saline. Both ipsilateral and
contralateral skull bones were carefully opened using a
high speed dental drill (Marothon-3; Korea), leaving the
underlying dura mater intact throughout the experiment.
Mice were then exposed to 90 min MCAo as described
above. Starting 1 min after reperfusion, real-time CBF
changes were recorded by means of a CCD camera
that was placed roughly 10 cm above the brain using a
Pericam PSI System (Perimed). The penetration depth
of the laser (785 nm) is approximately 500 µm below
the brain surface. Raw speckle images were taken at
2-second-intervals with a spatial image resolution of 20
µm. To evaluate the CBF changes in the ischemic core,
ischemic penumbra and ischemia-remote cortex, regions
of interest (ROI) covering 1.0 mm x 5.5 mm (in lateral and
rostrocaudal direction, respectively) were defined 0.5, 1.5
and 2.5 mm lateral and 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma, in
which mean CBF was calculated using a blood perfusion
imaging software (PIMSoft; Perimed) [23, 29]. Regional
CBF was recorded throughout the 90 min observation
period. From the measurements obtained, relative CBF
changes (in %) at the end of the observation period
compared to the beginning of the observation period were

Mice were anesthetized with 1% isofluorane (30%
O2, reminder N2O) and rectal temperature was controlled
between 36.5 and 37.0ºC using a feedback-controlled
heating system. During the experiments, CBF was
monitored via laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) using a
flexible 0.5 mm fiber optic probe (Perimed, Sweden)
which was attached with tissue adhesive to the intact skull
overlying the MCA territory (2 mm posterior and 6 mm
lateral from bregma). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced
using an intraluminal filament technique [16]. Briefly,
after a midline neck incision the left common and external
carotid arteries were isolated and ligated. A microvascular
clip (FE691; Aesculap) was temporarily placed on
the internal carotid artery. A 8-0 nylon monofilament
(Ethilon; Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) coated with
silicon resin (Xantopren; Bayer Dental, Osaka, Japon;
diameter of the coated suture 180 to 190 µm) was inserted
through a small incision into the common carotid artery
and advanced 9 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation for
MCAo. Reperfusion was initiated 30 or 90 min after onset
of ischemia by gentle monofilament removal.
One minute after reperfusion, anesthesia was
terminated, and mice were placed into an oxygen chamber
(R = 25cm), in which they were exposed to ambient
air (21%) or normobaric hyperoxia (70% or 100% O2;
remainder N2) over 90 minutes. At the same moment, 50

non-ischemic tissue were subtracted from those in the
ischemic tissue.

Analysis of neuronal injury

Western blot

For the evaluation of neuronal injury, coronal brain
sections at the level of the bregma from mice exposed
to 30 min MCAo were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA)/ 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and were
labeled using a TUNEL kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection
Kit; Roche, Switzerland). Sections were counterstained
with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Stainings
were analyzed by quantifying DNA-fragmented cells
(which in 30 min MCAo are equivalent to neurons) in
twelve adjacent ROI in the striatum, each measuring
62,500 µm2, under a confocal Zeiss LSM 780 microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

For Western blot analysis, brain tissue samples were
harvested from the ischemic striatum of mice exposed
to 90 min MCAo. Tissue samples belonging to the same
group were pooled, homogenized, sonicated, and treated
with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail. Total protein content was evaluated using
Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein (20 µg)
were size-fractionated using any-kD Mini-Protean TGX
gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane using the Trans-Blot TurboTransfer System
(Bio-Rad, Life Sciences Research). Thereafter, membranes
were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in 50 mMol Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T; blocking
solution) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed in 50
mMol TBS-T, and incubated overnight with polyclonal
rabbit anti-total (detecting both the phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated form) Akt (9272; Cell Signaling),
polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated Akt (9271; Cell
Signaling), monoclonal rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (2764; Cell
Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax (2772; Cell
Signaling), rabbit monoclonal anti-nNOS (Ab76067;
Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-iNOS (sc-650; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal anti-eNOS
(Ab66127; Abcam) antibody (all diluted 1:000). The
next day, membranes were washed with 50 mM TBS-T
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat-anti rabbit (31460; Thermo Scientific) antibody
(diluted 1:2500) for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots
were performed at least three times. Protein loading was
controlled by stripping and reprobing with polyclonal
rabbit anti-β-actin antibody (4967; Cell Signaling
Technology). Blots were developed using Clarity Western
ECL Substrate kit (Bio-Rad; Life Sciences Research) and
visualized using the ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad;
Life Sciences Research). Protein levels were analyzed
densitometrically using the ImageJ program, corrected
with values determined on β-actin blots and expressed
as relative values compared with vehicle treated mice
exposed to 21% NBO.

Analysis of infarct volume and brain swelling
For the evaluation of infarct volume and brain
swelling, coronal brain sections were collected at four
equidistant brain levels, 2 mm apart, from mice exposed
to 90 min MCAo, which were stained with cresyl violet
according to a standard protocol. Within the sections,
the border between infarcted and non-infarcted tissues
was outlined using an image analysis system (Image J;
National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), and
infarct area was assessed by subtracting the area of the
non-infarcted ipsilateral hemisphere from that of the
contralateral side. Infarct volume was calculated by
integration of these infarct areas. Edema was calculated
as the volume difference between the ischemic and the
non-ischemic hemisphere and expressed as percentage of
the volume of the non-ischemic hemisphere.

Analysis of serum IgG extravasation
With gentle stirring, brain sections from the
bregma level of mice exposed to 90 min MCAo were
rinsed for 10 min at room temperature in 0.1 M PBS to
remove intravascular IgG, and were fixed in 4% PFA
[30]. Following the blocking of endogenous peroxidase
with methanol/ 0.3% H2O2 and immersion in 0.1 M PBS
containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and normal
swine serum (1:1000), sections were incubated for 1 h in
biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (sc-2013; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and stained with an avidin peroxidase
kit (Vectastain Elite; Vector Labs) and diaminobenzidine
(Sigma). For reasons of data comparability, all sections
were processed in parallel. Sections were scanned and
IgG extravasation in the ischemic striatum and cortex was
densitometrically analyzed. For correction of background
staining, optical densities in corresponding contralateral
