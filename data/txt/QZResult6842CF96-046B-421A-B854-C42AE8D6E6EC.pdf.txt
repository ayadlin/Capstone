Abstract
More than 40% of colon cancers have a mutation in K-RAS
or N-RAS, GTPases that operate as central hubs for multiple
key signaling pathways within the cell. Utilizing an isogenic
panel of colon carcinoma cells with K-RAS or N-RAS
variations, we observed differences in tumor necrosis
factor-A (TNFA)–induced apoptosis. When the dynamics of
phosphorylated ERK response to TNFA were examined, KRAS mutant cells showed lower activation whereas N-RAS
mutant cells exhibited prolonged duration. These divergent
trends were partially explained by differential induction of
two ERK-modulatory circuits: negative feedback mediated by
dual-specificity phosphatase 5 and positive feedback by
autocrine transforming growth factor-A. Moreover, in the
various RAS mutant colon carcinoma lines, the transforming
growth factor-A autocrine loop differentially elicited a
further downstream chemokine (CXCL1/CXCL8) autocrine
loop, with the two loops having opposite effects on
apoptosis. Although the apoptotic responses of the RAS
mutant panel to TNFA treatment showed significant
dependence on the respective phosphorylated ERK dynamics, successful prediction across the various cell lines
required contextual information concerning additional pathways including IKK and p38. A quantitative computational
model based on weighted linear combinations of these
pathway activities successfully predicted not only the
spectrum of cell death responses but also the corresponding
chemokine production responses. Our findings indicate that
diverse RAS mutations yield differential cell behavioral
responses to inflammatory cytokine exposure by means of
(a) differential effects on ERK activity via multiple feedback
circuit mechanisms, and (b) differential effects on other key
signaling pathways contextually modulating ERK-related
dependence. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8191–9]

downstream effector pathways. Single amino acid mutations at
codons 12, 13, or 61 place RAS in a chronically active (GTP-bound)
state and are oncogenic (1). Mutations in both K-RAS and N-RAS
are found in colon cancer; however, K-RAS mutations are found in
nearly 50% of tumors whereas N-RAS mutations are found in f5%
(2, 3). Whether the disparate mutation frequencies reflect
underlying biological or functional differences is unknown.
However, determining differences between the oncogenic forms
of K-RAS and N-RAS could improve our ability to target therapies
to these subgroups of patients with colon cancer.
K-RAS and N-RAS are >90% homologous and seem to share
many of the same downstream effectors, including RAF and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (4). However, it is unclear how the
different RAS proteins compete for the same effectors and affect
cellular decisions. Several sources of evidence suggest that K-RAS
and N-RAS have distinct physiologic functions. Loss of K-Ras is
embryonically lethal in mice, whereas N-Ras knockout mice are
viable with defects in immune response (1). Mouse models of
K-RasG12D and N-RasG12D expressed in the colonic epithelium show
distinct phenotypes, with K-RasG12D stimulating hyperproliferation
and N-RasG12D conferring resistance to apoptosis (5). Oncogenic
K-RAS promotes butyrate-induced apoptosis in human colon
carcinoma cells (6), whereas N-RAS provides antiapoptotic signals
in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (7), indicating that apoptosis is
a key cellular process that the RAS proteins differentially regulate.
The effects of RAS proteins and their oncogenic forms in
response to inflammation and apoptotic stimuli are of particular
interest for colon cancer. Chronic inflammation has been shown to
induce DNA damage and colon tumors in mice (8). Similarly,
patients with long-term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an
increased risk of developing colon cancer (9). Although nearly half
of colon carcinomas express oncogenic K-RAS, IBD is not
associated with K-RAS mutations (10), and links between IBD
and N-RAS mutations have not been investigated. Although
inflammation is multifaceted, mice that overproduce the cytokine
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) develop an IBD-like phenotype
(11), and monoclonal TNFa antibodies have shown some benefit as
a therapy for IBD (12), indicating one cytokine of interest.
In this work, we examine the response of an isogenic panel of
colon carcinoma cell lines with wild-type RAS, mutant K-RAS,
mutant N-RAS, or reduced levels of N-RAS to determine how the
different RAS configurations affect the apoptotic response to TNFa.
We observed consequent differences in phosphorylated ERK
(pERK) dynamics and identified changes in negative feedback
mediated by dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5) and positive
feedback by autocrine transforming growth factor-a (TGFa)
among the RAS variants. Additionally, we identified TGFa-induced

chemokine autocrine loops that provide prosurvival input to the
cells. To further refine our understanding of the influence of RAS on
the TNFa response, we obtained quantitative dynamic measurements of phosphoprotein signals across multiple pathways and
elucidated key combinations of these signals capable of predicting
differential apoptosis and chemokine production behavior for the
different lines. Our findings indicate that diverse RAS mutations
yield differential cell behavioral responses to inflammatory
cytokine exposure by means of (a) differential effects on ERK
activity via multiple feedback circuit mechanisms, and (b)
differential effects on other key signaling pathways contextually
modulating ERK-related dependence.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatments. DLD-1, a colon carcinoma cell line with a
single copy K-RASG13D mutation, and their isogenic partner, DKs8, in which
K-RASG13D was removed by homologous recombination, have been
previously described (ref. 13; Fig. 1A). DKs8-N, which overexpress mutant
N-RASG12V were generated by the infection of DKs8 with MSCV retrovirus
(14). DKs8-kdN, which are wild-type with respect to K-RAS and have
reduced levels of wild-type N-RAS, were generated via lentiviral shRNA
using the pSICOR retrovirus and DKs8 (15).
All cell lines were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum;
DKs8-kdN were also supplemented with 7.5 Ag/mL of puromycin to maintain
shRNA selection. For experiments, cells were plated in 10% fetal bovine serum
at 15,000 cells/cm2 (DLD-1, DKs8-N) or 18,000 cells/cm2 (DKs8, DKs8-kdN).
After 24 h, cells were sensitized with 200 units/mL of IFNg (Roche Applied
Science) in 5% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were treated with either
vehicle or 100 ng/mL of TNFa (Peprotech). In a subset of experiments,
cycloheximide or repertaxin were added with TNFa (2.5 Ag/mL and 0.1 Amol/
L, respectively; Sigma) or ab225 was added prior to TNFa (10 Ag/mL; a gift
from H.S. Wiley, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA).
Lysis and signaling measurements. At various times after TNFa
stimulation (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 480, and 720 min) cells were lysed
using Bio-Plex cell lysis buffer for clarified lysates (Bio-Rad) and an SDSbased lysis buffer for whole cell lysates (16). Total protein concentrations
were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).
Phosphoproteins (pERK1, pERK2, pInBa, pJNK, pAKT, and pHSP27) were
detected using commercially available kits for the Luminex system (BioRad). A master positive reference sample was loaded in each assay for
normalization purposes. Cleaved caspase-8 was detected using immunoblots, again with positive reference samples for normalization purposes. For
cleaved caspase-8, 50 Ag of total protein was loaded and probed (Cell
Signaling Technology). Blots were detected with ECL Advance (GE
Healthcare) and imaged on a Kodak Image Station 1000.
Flow cytometry. Floating and adherent cells were pooled and analyzed
for apoptosis using Annexin V/propidium iodide and cleaved caspase-3/
cleaved PARP similar to the previously described methods (16). A minimum
of 25,000 cells per condition were analyzed on a BD Biosciences LSRII (part
of the Koch Institute Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Cambridge, MA) and by FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).
ELISAs. Conditioned medium was collected and analyzed for TGFa and
interleukins (IL-1ra, IL-1a, and IL-1h) by ELISA (R&D Systems), and screened
for 50 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors with Human Group I and II
multiplex assays (Bio-Rad). Follow-up assays for vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL8, and
CXCL10 were performed using individual assays (Bio-Rad). For normalization, cells were trypsinized and the live cell fraction was counted using a
ViCell XR (Beckman Coulter). TACE levels were determined by ELISA (R&D
Systems) from lysates of IFNg-sensitized cells according to the instructions
of the manufacturer and normalized to total protein determined by
bicinchoninic acid assay.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The expression levels of
DUSP5 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined
by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for RNA collected at 0, 30, 90, and

and stained with anti-CXCR1 (1:25; BD PharMingen) or anti-CXCR2 (1:5;
R&D Systems) overnight at 4jC, then detected with Alexa 488 donkey antimouse IgG (1:400) and phalloidin-rhodamine (1:200; Invitrogen). Slides were
imaged on a DeltaVision microscope (Applied Precision) with a 60 oil
objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). Sections (0.2 Am) were captured and the
stack compressed with the maximum value at each pixel displayed.
Partial least squares regression modeling and statistical analysis.
The compiled data set represents approximately 1,800 individual proteomic
measurements. Multipathway models for this data set were generated using
the partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm in SimcaP (Umetrics;
see ref. 17 for details). Signal and response data were unit variance–scaled
(16) and models were tested by cross-validation. The independent variable
block for the full PLSR model included 64 measurements—six phosphorylated proteins at 10 time points and four measures of cleaved caspase-8.
Data are represented as average + SE, with three independent measurements for each treatment condition. Comparisons were performed by
ANOVA and Tukey-HSD, with significance set to P < 0.05.

TNFa, we used an isogenic panel of colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 1A)
that express both TNFR1 and TNFR2 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
TNFa treatment resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis
as measured by cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Fig. S2; P < 0.0001). RAS variations affected the
extent of TNFa-induced apoptosis, with mutations in K-RAS

(DLD-1) or reductions in N-RAS (DKs8-kdN) showing the highest
levels of apoptosis. These results are consistent with other reports
of K-RAS mutations being proapoptotic and N-RAS having a
protective role (7, 15, 18). Despite the biochemical similarities in
K-RAS and N-RAS mutants, the Dks8-N cells do not exhibit
this heightened sensitivity to the apoptotic stimuli. Resistance to

apoptosis has been described as a necessary step for tumor
development (19). Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that
colon carcinoma cell lines with the common K-RAS mutation are
more sensitive to TNFa than cells with wild-type RAS (Fig. 1B).
However, K-RAS mutations are less common in IBD-associated
cancers than in the general population of colon cancers (10).
Negative regulators of pERK dynamics differ among RAS
variants. To examine how changes in RAS expression level and
mutation status affected TNFa-induced apoptosis, we first examined
the dynamics of pERK1 and pERK2 following treatment (Fig. 2A).
These assays were performed using the Luminex platform, which
was validated to determine that measurements were reliably
quantitative (Supplementary Fig. S3; ref. 20). RAS variants had
different early and late patterns for pERK. DLD-1 cells had much
lower levels of pERK in the early peaks (f15 minutes) whereas DKs8N cells had pERK levels that did not return to baseline by 4 hours.
The importance of pathway-specificity in determining the
activation of DUSP genes has recently been highlighted (21).
Therefore, we reasoned that the RAS variants might affect which
DUSPs are turned on in response to TNFa and this could explain
the extended signaling observed in DKs8-N cells. To determine

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

whether the different patterns of pERK required newly synthesized
proteins, cells were treated with cycloheximide and TNFa. DLD-1,
DKs8, and DKs8-kdN had elevated pERK signals when treated with
cycloheximide and TNFa compared with TNFa alone (Fig. 2A).
DKs8-N cells showed little difference with cycloheximide, indicating that an induced phosphatase could differ between the RAS
variants. Primers were validated for nine DUSPs that recognize ERK
as a substrate (ref. 22; Supplementary Fig. S4). An initial screen
identified DUSP5 as a target DUSP that was induced in response to
TNFa treatment (Supplementary Table S1). When assayed by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, DUSP5 was induced in all
four cell lines (Fig. 2B). The overall level and extent of induction
was lower in DKs8-N cells, and a strong inverse correlation was
observed between the normalized level of DUSP5 at 1.5 hours and
the level of pERK1 at 2 hours (Fig. 2C).
Differences in TGFA autocrine loop among RAS variants.
TNFa treatment has been previously shown to induce a TGFa
autocrine cascade in the B-RAF mutant HT-29 colon carcinoma
cells (23). To determine if this cascade was present in our RAS
variant panel, cells were treated with TNFa and ab225, a
monoclonal antibody that blocks EGFR and prevents the uptake
of released TGFa. Significant increases in the levels of TGFa in the
cell culture medium were seen within 15 minutes of TNFa
treatment (Fig. 3A; P = 0.0001). Over time, TGFa accumulated in
the medium at a rate between 0.6 and 1.3 pg/100,000 cells/h; the
long-term rates were lower than the initial bursts (9.8–43.8 pg/
100,000 cells/h). The very rapid initial increase in TGFa production
suggests a nontranscriptional mechanism such as transactivation
(24). Cells treated with TNFa and ab255 had significantly reduced
levels of pERK1 at 15 minutes (Fig. 3B), indicating that this
autocrine loop is responsible for much of the early peak (Fig. 2A).
Different levels of pro-TGFa, TACE/ADAM17 (TNF-converting
enzyme/a disintegrin and metalloprotease)—the metalloprotease
implicated in the ectodomain cleavage of pro-TGFa (25), and/or
EGFR could conceivably explain the difference in early ERK
behavior. Levels of EGFR were not significantly different between
RAS variants, but DKs8 and DKs8-kdN cells exhibited significantly
higher levels of TACE and DKs8-dkN cells showing substantially
lower levels of pro-TGFa (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that
both of these factors could be influential. Indeed, the product of
pro-TGFa and TACE levels at the time of TNFa treatment
correlated monotonically with short-term TGFa-induced increases
in pERK1 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the relative magnitudes of this
TGFa autocrine loop-mediated pERK signaling for the different
RAS variants does not seem to immediately correspond to their
respective TNFa-induced apoptosis responses (Fig. 1B). This
observation motivated us to consider further consequences of
the TGFa autocrine loop as well as other pathway effects.
TNFA-induced production of multiple chemokines and
growth factors. The TNFa-induced TGFa autocrine loop has
been shown to induce additional autocrine loops, including an IL1a/IL-1ra cascade (in HT-29 cells; ref. 23) and an IL-1a/IL-1h/IL1ra cascade (primary rat hepatocytes; ref. 26). The RAS-variant cell
lines did not secrete detectable levels of IL-1a, IL-1h, or IL-1ra
(data not shown). A screen of media from TNFa-treated cells for 50
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors revealed detectable
levels of CCL2, CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12,
ICAM1, MIF, and VEGF. Of these 10 positive results, CXCL1, CXCL8,
CXCL10, and VEGF showed significant increases with TNFa
treatment (Fig. 4; Supplementary Figs. S6A and S7A). VEGF and
CXCL8 (IL-8) levels were similar between all four RAS variants

Multiple Pathways are Affected by Variations in RAS

Figure 4. RAS-variant cells express CXCR1 and CXCR2 and produce CXCL1 and CXCL8 in response to TNFa treatment. A and B, CXCL1 and CXCL8 were
quantified by Luminex assay and normalized to concurrent cell counts. CXCR1 (C) and CXCR2 (D ) were observed in DLD-1 cells by immunofluorescence. Green,
CXCR1,2; red, phalloidin for actin filaments.

whereas CXCL1 (GROa) and CXCL10 (IP-10) were substantially
lower in K-RAS and N-RAS mutant cells both before and after
TNFa treatment. To determine whether secretion of these proteins
could lead to additional autocrine cascades, cells were examined at
the time of TNFa treatment for the appropriate receptors by
immunofluorescence or PCR. None of the RAS variant cells
expressed VEGF-R2 (Supplementary Fig. S7B ). DLD-1 cells
expressed CXCR1 ( for CXCL8), CXCR2 ( for CXCL1 and CXCL8),
and CXCR3 ( for CXCL10) indicating possible autocrine loops
(Fig. 4C and D; Supplementary Fig. S6B).

TGFA and chemokine autocrine loops are linked and
contrapositively affect apoptosis. To determine if the increase
in CXCL1, CXCL8, and CXCL10 following TNFa treatment was
mediated by the TGFa autocrine cascade, the RAS variant cells
were treated with TNFa and ab225. Levels of all three chemokines
were substantially reduced with ab225 cotreatment, indicating that
the chemokine response to TNFa was a consequence of the
induced TGFa autocrine loop (Fig. 5A; data not shown). The effect
of these autocrine loops on apoptosis was examined by cotreatment with TNFa and ab225 or repertaxin (a noncompetitive

allosteric inhibitor of CXCR1/2; ref. 27). Blockade of the TGFa loop
with ab225 decreased apoptosis in all four RAS variants, whereas
repertaxin treatment increased apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Exogenous
treatment with CXCL10 to supplement TNFa and ab225 cotreated
cells had no effect on apoptosis at 24 hours, suggesting that
CXCL10 does not directly affect the apoptotic decision (Supplementary Fig. S6C). The molecular logic of the TNFa/TGFa/CXCL1/
8 autocrine cascades (Fig. 5C) suggests that the TGFa autocrine
loop has multiple downstream effects, including the described
pERK effects and induction of chemokines. Despite the induction
of a prosurvival chemokine loop, the net effect of TGFa was
proapoptotic. To further examine these complex influences and
help gain further insight into the effect of RAS mutations on the
interpretation of these loops, we measured phosphoprotein signals
across multiple pathways alongside that of ERK.
Multipathway models can predict apoptosis and chemokine levels. Lysates from vehicle-treated and TNFa-treated RAS
variant cells were analyzed for additional signaling molecules
that are downstream of the TNF receptor or RAS (pInBa,
pHSP27, pAKT, pJNK, and cleaved caspase-8). The resulting data
set (Fig. 6A) shows substantial differences in pInBa, pHSP27,
pJNK, and cleaved caspase-8 with TNFa treatment, whereas
pAKT signaling does not seem to be dependent on TNFa. DKs8
cells have strong peaks in pJNK and pHSP27 at early times,
whereas DKs8-N have higher signals compared with the other
RAS variants at later times, similar to the pERK data (Figs. 2A
and 6A). Interestingly, although they have similar levels of
apoptosis (Fig. 1B), DLD-1 and DKs8-kdN cells have different
signaling patterns for multiple molecules (Fig. 6A).
To analyze this multipathway data set, we used PLSR, which has
been described (28) and applied elsewhere (17, 29). In PLSR, the X
matrix (here the signaling data set) is regressed against the Y
matrix (here, either apoptosis or chemokine levels). PLSR reduces
the dimensionality of the data matrix to fewer variables by
emphasizing the independent measurements that strongly covary
with the dependent outcomes—in essence, PLSR attempts to
develop a model in which similar signaling ‘‘signatures’’ are
associated with similar functional responses. PLSR models are
constructed in an iterative process by calculating principal
components—linear combinations of variables in the original
independent and dependent blocks. The first principal component
captures the strongest variation in the original data matrix, whereas
succeeding principal components capture remaining variation. The
number of principal components that results in the minimum error
signifies the model with the maximum useful information captured
without extending to include variation from experimental noise.
An important element of PLSR modeling is how the data is
preprocessed (16). We constructed models using the raw data from
each assay, data normalized to concurrently run master lysates,
data normalized to the values for each signal at the zero time point
of that cell line, and data normalized to the maximum signal across
all conditions and times. Only data normalized to the concurrently
run master lysates was successful in building predictive models

(Q 2Y > 0.7) for both chemokines and apoptosis outcomes (Fig. 6B,
top; data not shown). Previous studies in our lab have used signalderived metrics, such as time derivatives and area-under-the-curve
measures as part of the X matrix (30). Our results indicated that
these metrics did not substantially change model fit (R 2Y) or
predictiveness (Q 2Y), likely because they primarily represent linear
combinations of the X variables (data not shown).
To assess the importance of the various signals in the PLSR
models, we evaluated reduced models, which used various subsets
of the independent variables to fit the response data (Fig. 6B,
middle). Example subsets include early times (0–60 minutes), late
times (after 60 minutes), and individual signal measurements.
Although R 2Y is not strongly affected in the resulting three
component models, Q 2Y varied widely. For apoptosis, the best
predicting signals were pInBa and cleaved caspase-8, whereas
pERK1, pERK2, and pHSP27 were stronger predictors for CXCL1
and CXCL8. Importantly, models built without these dominant
signals were still nearly as predictive as the full models (Q 2Y of
0.577 for apoptosis and 0.587 for chemokines). Early time signals
were more predictive for chemokine levels whereas late time
signals were more predictive for apoptosis.
The models based on the full signal data sets were analyzed in
more detail to determine how the RAS variants and treatments are
captured in terms of the model (Fig. 6B, bottom; Supplementary
Tables S2–S8). Loadings describe how strongly each signal projects
along that individual principal component, whereas scores describe
how strongly each treatment condition projects (31). For both
models, the scores for the treatment conditions indicate that the
first principal component describes the effect of TNFa treatment,
whereas the second and third principal components capture the
RAS variations. The two models have different scoring patterns for
these later components, with DLD-1 cells projecting positively in
both models’ second components, whereas DKs8-N projects
positively in the third component for apoptosis, but in the second
component for chemokines. This corresponds to the difference in
DLD-1 and DKs8-N with respect to apoptosis (Fig. 1B) but not
chemokine levels (Fig. 4A and B). Examination of the top 20
variable importance of projection values (Supplementary Table S2)
indicated that pIkBa and pERK1 dominate the apoptosis model,
whereas the important signals are more broadly distributed for
chemokine production.
High loadings in the first principal components of each model
were skewed to pInBa and pERK1 (a result of the TNFa-TGFa
autocrine cascade; Fig. 3A), consistent with the interpretation of
the first component as a ‘‘TNFa treatment’’ axis (Supplementary
Table S3 and S6). The second principal component of the apoptosis
model included large loadings for many of the zero time point
values, consistent with the differences seen in baselines for DLD-1
(Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 6A). The third principal component
for the apoptosis model includes strong negative loadings for
pAKT measures, which are lower in the DKs8-N cells (Supplementary Table S5). The second and third components of the chemokine

signaling molecules at various times, potentially highlighting
pan-RAS mutant effects (Supplementary Table S7 and S8).

Discussion
Our results show that cells with oncogenic K-RAS, oncogenic NRAS, or no RAS mutations differentially affect multiple pathways to
influence cell fate. These perturbations to the cell network
influence the ERK pathway by convoluting positive and negative
feedback circuits, as well as additional pathways that together
direct cell behavior. Importantly, despite the clear differences in
ERK, prediction of the RAS effect on apoptosis and chemokine
levels requires the incorporation of both ERK and additional
pathways which provide a context for the ERK variations.
Similar to previous reports in HT-29 cells (23) and mammary
epithelial cells (24), TNFa treatment led to transactivation of the
EGFR by TGFa in the RAS-variant cells. TACE has been
implicated as the enzyme responsible for cleaving TGFa from
the cell surface (25). Interestingly, activation of ERK has been
linked to the phosphorylation of TACE, which results in
trafficking of TACE to the cell surface (32). Despite their
constitutively active K-RAS allele, DLD-1 cells exhibit lower levels
of basal pERK, which is mitigated by DUSP6 (5). The reduced
levels of basal pERK, combined with the lower levels of TACE
(Supplementary Fig. S5C), likely explain the reduced TGFa
release and subsequent lower activation of pERK in DLD-1.
Differences in pERK at later times among the RAS variants seem
to be mediated by a transcriptionally induced protein, DUSP5.
Induction of the negative-feedback DUSP genes was recently shown
to be pathway-specific process (21). DUSP5 is a nuclear-localized
phosphatase with ERK-specificity (22) that is induced by growth
factors and stress (33). In the DKs8-N cells, normalized DUSP5
levels are lower, and induction is delayed, correlating with the
extended duration of pERK in these cells with oncogenic N-RAS
(Fig. 2C). DUSP6, a cytoplasmic ERK-specific phosphatase, has been
previously shown to affect basal pERK in K-RAS mutant cells (5)
and is induced during cellular transformation by oncogenic RAS
(34). To our knowledge, this is the first report of RAS-dependent
differential activation of DUSP5.
The TNFa-induced TGFa autocrine loop was previously shown
to initiate a prodeath IL-1 loop in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells (23).
In the RAS mutant cell lines, we found no evidence for the IL-1
loop, and instead, our results suggest that TGFa initiated a
prodeath loop as well as a prosurvival CXCL1 and/or CXCL8
cascade (Fig. 5C). CXCL1 has been reported to be elevated in colon
cancer (35) and associated with greater proliferation and
invasiveness in colon carcinoma cells (36), whereas CXCL8
constitutes a proproliferative autocrine loop in HCT-116 (37).
Recent reports have begun to highlight unexpected autocrine roles
for chemokines, including CXCR2/p53-dependent senescence (38),

which were not observed in this panel of p53 mutant cell lines (13).
It will be important in future studies to examine the relative
importance of the paracrine and autocrine effects of chemokine
production on tumor development.
To interpret the broader effects of RAS variations on the cellular
signaling network, and how these changes are integrated into
decisions, we used a large phosphoproteomic data set and PLSR
(Fig. 6). PLSR has been previously used to provide evidence for
induced autocrine cascades, demonstrate common effector processing for cell-specific responses, and predict the production of
interleukins (23, 39, 40). In these studies, we show that the same
compendium of signals can predict diverse outcomes (apoptosis
and CXCL1/8). The two models have different components
(Supplemental Tables S2-S8), indicating that parts of the signaling
network are more responsible for one outcome versus another. We
also show that models built without the ‘‘dominant’’ signals are still
predictive. This observation is important as it (a) suggests that the
data and model allow us to observe how a change in one signal is
propagated throughout a network, and (b) indicates that even by
only collecting information about a few molecules, we can still
capture important network behavior. The separate PLSR models
show time-dependence, suggesting that the ‘‘early’’ signals result in
the production of chemokines for the CXCL1/8 autocrine loop. The
‘‘late’’ signals, which may represent the effects of these chemokine
loops, then determine the apoptotic decision.
In conclusion, we have shown multiple differences that result
from changes in the form of mutant RAS expressed by cells.
Although pERK signals in response to TNFa are clearly different
through changes in both positive and negative feedback circuits,
only with the inclusion of additional pathway context can we
predict the differences seen in apoptosis between the RAS
variants. Combined, our data suggests that multipathway models
could interpret the influence of the oncogenic RAS proteins by
including both direct effects (pERK) and contextual effects such
as how the TGFa-chemokine autocrine cascade affects other
signaling pathways.
