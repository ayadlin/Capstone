Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin
modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly
exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs1.
Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug
intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an
incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we
describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia
(AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin
states2. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known
chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein
bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance.
Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust
antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and
elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human
AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML
subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc
expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to
suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising
therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA
interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for
direct pharmacological intervention.
AML represents a paradigm for understanding how complex patterns of cooperating genetic
and epigenetic alterations lead to tumorigenesis3,4. Although this complexity poses a
challenge for the development of targeted therapies, diverse gene mutations in AML
generally converge functionally to deregulate similar core cellular processes. One key event
in AML initiation is the corruption of cell-fate programs to generate leukaemia stem cells
that aberrantly self-renew and thereby maintain and propagate the disease5. Although it is
incompletely understood, this process has been linked to changes in regulatory chromatin
modifications2. For example, common AML oncogenes such as those encoding the AML1ETO and MLL fusion proteins induce self-renewal programs at least in part through
reprogramming of epigenetic pathways6,7. In addition, several genes encoding epigenetic
regulators have been identified as targets of somatic mutation in AML8,9. Because
epigenetic alterations induced by oncogenic stimuli are potentially reversible, chromatin
regulators are being explored as candidate drug targets1.

To probe epigenetic pathways required for AML maintenance systematically, we built a
custom shRNA library targeting 243 known chromatin regulators, including most ‘writers’,
‘readers’ and ‘erasers’ of epigenetic marks (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table
1). This library of 1,094 shRNAs (3–6 per gene) was constructed in TRMPV-Neo, a vector
optimized for negative-selection RNAi screening, and was transduced as one pool into an
established Tet-on-competent AML mouse model driven by MLL-AF9 and NrasG12D (ref.
10). After drug selection, shRNA expression was induced by addition of doxycycline, and
changes in library representation after 14 days of culture were monitored using deep
sequencing of shRNA guide strands amplified from genomic DNA (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 2). Using the scoring criterion of more than twenty-fold depletion in
each of two independent replicates, 177 shRNAs were strongly depleted. These included all
eight positive-control shRNAs targeting essentialgenes (Rpa1, Rpa3, Pcna and Polr2b), as
well as several shRNAs targeting two known MLL-AF9 cofactors (Men1 and Psip1)11,12.
Genes for which at least two independent shRNAs scored were subjected to extensive oneby-one validation using an independent MLL-AF9/NrasG12D AML cell line and vector
system (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In both the primary screen and validation stages, several

shRNAs targeting Brd4 were among the most strongly depleted, identifying this gene as the
top scorer in the screen (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3b).

Brd4 is a member of the BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins that bind to
acetylated histones to influence transcription13. BRD4 is also a proto-oncogene that can be
mutated via chromosomal translocation in a rare form of squamous-cell carcinoma14,
although a role in leukaemia has not been described. The recent development of smallmolecule BET bromodomain inhibitors15,16, together with our screening results, prompted
us to investigate the suitability of Brd4 as an AML drug target. Five independent Brd4
shRNAs showed a close correspondence between knockdown efficiency and growth
inhibition, indicating on-target effects (Fig. 1b). Suppression of Brd4 led to cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis of leukaemia cells, whereas the equivalent knockdown in immortalized
murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) led to only modest cell-cycle inhibition without
cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). Brd4 knockdown also failed to influence the growth
of non-transformed G1E erythroblast cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e). In addition, shRNAs
targeting BRD4 were sufficient to induce cell-cycle arrest in two MLL-AF9+ human AML
lines (Supplementary Fig. 5). Together, these results indicate that Brd4 is a critical
requirement in MLL-AF9-induced AML.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we examined the sensitivity of leukaemia cells to JQ1, a first-in-class small-molecule
inhibitor of BET bromodomains with highest affinity for the first bromodomain of Brd4 (ref.
15). Proliferation of mouse MLL-fusion leukaemia cells was notably sensitive to submicromolar JQ1 concentrations, as compared to proliferation of fibroblasts and G1E cells
(Fig. 1c), correlating with the relative impact of Brd4 shRNAs on proliferation of these
different cell types. We also examined growth-inhibitory effects of JQ1 in a series of
established human leukaemia cell lines as well as in adult and paediatric primary leukaemia
samples. We observed broad growth-suppressive activity of JQ1 (IC50 < 500 nM) in 13 out
of 14 AML cell lines (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b) and in 12 out of 15 primary
human AML samples, representing diverse disease subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 7, 8). In
addition, all three primary MLL-rearranged infant leukaemias tested were sensitive to JQ1
(Supplementary Fig. 8), whereas other non-AML-leukaemia and solid-tumour cell lines
showed minimal sensitivity to the compound (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 6c). In all
AML lines examined, JQ1 treatment triggered cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, similar to the
effects seen upon shRNA-mediated Brd4 knockdown (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Figs 7–
9). Together, these data indicate a critical requirement for Brd4 in AML proliferation that
can be effectively inhibited using the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1.

We next investigated the relevance of Brd4 to AML progression in vivo. To suppress Brd4
in established AML in mice, Tet-on-competent MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells were
transduced with TRMPV-Neo constructs containing Brd4 shRNAs or control shRNAs, and
transplanted into secondary recipient mice (Supplementary Fig. 10). After disease onset,
confirmed by bioluminescent imaging, shRNA expression was induced by doxycycline
administration. Subsequent monitoring showed that Brd4 knockdown resulted in a marked
delay in leukaemia progression and a survival benefit (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Fig.
11). Taking advantage of the dsRed reporter linked to shRNA expression in the TRMPVNeo vector10, flow-cytometry analysis verified that Brd4-shRNA-positive cells were
depleted in the terminal leukaemia burden as compared to controls, indicating that the mice
succumbed to an outgrowth of Brd4-shRNA-negative cells (Fig. 2d, e). Together, these data
indicate that RNAi-mediated suppression of Brd4 inhibits leukaemia progression in vivo.
To examine whether JQ1 has single-agent activity in AML, mice transplanted with MLLAF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells were treated either with daily injections of JQ1 (50 mg kg−1)
or with vehicle. JQ1 administration led to a marked delay in disease progression and

significantly extended survival (Fig. 2f–h). JQ1 also showed single-agent activity in an
intervention setting, in which treatment was initiated only after disease was detected by
bioluminescent imaging (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 12). Comparable effects were
observed in an independent AML mouse model based on expression of AML1-ETO9a and
NrasG12D and loss of p53 (ref. 17), which is known to be insensitive to conventional
chemotherapy (Supplementary Fig. 13). Consistent with previous findings15, JQ1 treatment
was well tolerated in mice, with little if any impact on normal haematopoiesis
(Supplementary Figs 14–16). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that JQ1 has potent
and leukaemia-specific effects as a single agent in vivo.

AML is characterized by an expanded self-renewal capacity linked with an inability to
complete terminal myeloid differentiation. Therefore, we next considered whether Brd4
influences the differentiation state of leukaemia cells. Both expression of Brd4 shRNA and
JQ1 treatment altered the morphology of MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia from
myelomonocytic blasts to cells with a macrophage-like appearance (Fig. 3a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 17a). Upon Brd4 inhibition, leukaemia cells showed increased surface
expression of integrin αM (Itgam, also known as Mac-1), a myeloid differentiation marker,
and decreased expression of Kit, a marker associated with leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) in
mouse models of MLL-rearranged leukaemia (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 17b,
c)18,19. In addition, JQ1 treatment induced morphological signs of maturation phenotypes in
most of the primary leukaemia samples tested, albeit to varying degrees (Supplementary
Figs 7 and 8).
To further investigate whether suppression of Brd4 affects the LSC compartment, we
performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of expression microarray data obtained
from Brd4-shRNA-treated and JQ1-treated leukaemia cells20. GSEA revealed a marked
upregulation of macrophage-specific gene expression after Brd4 inhibition (Fig. 3e, f), as
well as global downregulation of a gene expression signature previously shown to
discriminate LSCs from non-self-renewing leukaemia cell populations (Fig. 3g, h)21. A
similar profile of gene expression changes was seen after JQ1 treatment of THP-1 cells, a
human MLL-AF9-expressing AML cell line (Supplementary Fig. 18). Although we cannot
exclude the involvement of additional cellular targets, the strong concordance between
phenotypes induced by Brd4 shRNAs and JQ1 supports Brd4 as the relevant target of JQ1 in
AML. Together, these findings indicate that Brd4 is critically required to maintain LSC
populations and prevent terminal myeloid differentiation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recent evidence indicates that the Myc transcriptional network has an important role in LSC
self-renewal22,23. Because previous studies also implicate Myc as a potential downstream
target of Brd4 (refs 24, 25), we examined whether this regulatory function was relevant to
the antileukaemic effects of JQ1. Brd4 inhibition with shRNAs or JQ1 led to a marked
reduction of mRNA and protein levels of Myc in MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia, whereas
these effects were minimal in MEF and G1E cells (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 19a–
c). Downregulation of Myc mRNA levels occurred within 60 min of JQ1 exposure,
qualitatively preceding the increased expression of genes related to macrophage
differentiation, such as Cd74 (Fig. 4c). Supporting a direct role in Myc transcriptional
regulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments identified a region of focal
Brd4 occupancy about 2 kilo-bases upstream of the Myc promoter and this was eliminated
after exposure to competitive JQ1 (Fig. 4d). As expected, RNAi- or JQ1-induced
suppression of Brd4 led to a global reduction in expression of Myc target genes22,26
(Supplementary Figs 19d and 20). Notably, JQ1 treatment triggered Myc downregulation in
a broad array of mouse and human leukaemia cell lines examined (Fig. 4a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 21), indicating that JQ1 may provide a means to suppress the Myc
pathway in a range of AML subtypes.

To evaluate whether suppression of Myc confers the growth-inhibitory effects of JQ1, we
generated MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cultures in which the Myc cDNA was ectopically
expressed from a retroviral promoter, which resulted in Myc expression levels that were only
slightly elevated but entirely resistant to JQ1-induced suppression (Fig. 4e and
Supplementary Fig. 22a). Notably, ectopic Myc expression conferred nearly complete
resistance to cell-cycle arrest and macrophage differentiation induced by JQ1 and Brd4
shRNA (Fig. 4g, h and Supplementary Figs 22b and 23). Furthermore, global geneexpression profiling revealed that most of the JQ1-induced transcriptional changes are
probably secondary effects of Myc downregulation (Supplementary Fig. 24). Notably,
ectopic Myc expression was unable to prevent JQ1-induced cell death, indicating that Brd4
has Myc-independent roles in regulating cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 22c, d). These
findings collectively support a role for Brd4 in maintaining Myc expression to preserve an
undifferentiated cellular state in AML.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

By taking a non-biased screening approach targeting epigenetic regulators, our study has
identified Brd4 as a critical factor required for AML disease maintenance. Because Brd4 is
not evidently mutated or overexpressed in AML (Supplementary Fig. 25), the exquisite
sensitivity of leukaemia cells to Brd4 inhibition would not have been revealed simply
through genetic or transcriptional characterization of this disease. We further show that the
bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML contexts and, by comparing
its effects to those induced by Brd4 shRNAs, we provide evidence that Brd4 is the primary
target for the antileukaemic activity of JQ1. Of note, JQ1 is a first-generation chemical
inhibitor yet to be optimized for in vivo delivery, with a half-life of only about 1 h in rodents
(Supplementary Fig. 26 and ref. 15). The more robust antileukaemic effects seen using Brd4
shRNAs in vivo indicate that second-generation derivatives of this compound may have
greater clinical activity. Regardless, our results unambiguously highlight the utility of RNAi
screening for revealing candidate drug targets in cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a competitive inhibitor of the acetyl-lysine binding domain, JQ1 interferes with the
ability of Brd4 to ‘read’ histone acetylation marks that facilitate transcriptional activation15.
When applied to leukaemia cells, JQ1 interferes with transcriptional circuits supporting selfrenewal, thus targeting LSCs and inducing terminal differentiation. In a parallel study, we
identified the transcription factor Myb as a critical mediator of addiction to the MLL-AF9
oncogene (Zuber et al., in press). Notably, global gene-expression changes observed after
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Brd4 are remarkably similar to those seen upon
suppressing Myb (Zuber et al., in press), indicating that Myb and Brd4 may intersect
functionally in a common transcriptional circuit that is essential for malignant self-renewal.
A key downstream effector of both Myb and Brd4 is the oncoprotein Myc (ref. 27), which
has been validated as an attractive therapeutic target but has thus far escaped efforts at
pharmacological inhibition28,29. Although the precise mechanism remains to be further
defined, targeting Brd4 abolishes Myc expression and limits self-renewal, with selectivity
for the malignant context, thus avoiding the haematopoietic toxicities that may be associated
with systemic Myc inhibition30. As such, our study may define a general strategy to disarm
oncogenic pathways through the direct modulation of the epigenetic machinery.

METHODS
Pooled negative-selection RNAi screening
A custom shRNA library targeting 243 chromatin-regulating mouse genes was designed
using miR30-adapted BIOPREDsi predictions (six shRNAs per gene) and constructed by
PCR-cloning a pool of oligonucleotides synthesized on 55k customized arrays (Agilent

per gene) were combined with several positive- and negative-control shRNAs at equal
concentrations in one pool. This pool was subcloned into TRMPV-Neo and transduced into
Tet-on MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells using conditions that predominantly lead to a
single retroviral integration and represent each shRNA in a calculated number of >500 cells

were selected for 5 days using 1 mg ml−1 G418 (Invitrogen); at each passage more than
twenty million cells were maintained to preserve library representation throughout the
experiment. After drug selection, T0 samples were obtained (~twenty million cells per
replicate) and cells were subsequently cultured with 0.5 mg ml−1 G418 and 1 μg ml−1
doxycycline to induce shRNA expression. After 14 days (12 passages, T14), about fifteen
million shRNA-expressing (dsRed+/Venus+) cells were sorted for each replicate using a
FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNA from T0 and T14 samples was isolated by
two rounds of phenol extraction using PhaseLock tubes (5prime) followed by isopropanol
precipitation. Deep-sequencing template libraries were generated by PCR amplification of
shRNA guide strands as previously described10. Libraries were analysed on an Illumina
Genome Analyser at a final concentration of 8 pM; 18 nucleotides of the guide strand were
sequenced using a custom primer (miR30EcoRISeq,
TAGCCCCTTGAATTCCGAGGCAGTAGGCA). To provide a sufficient baseline for
detecting shRNA depletion in experimental samples, we aimed to acquire >500 reads per
shRNA in the T0 sample, which required more than ten million reads per sample to
compensate for disparities in shRNA representation inherent in the pooled plasmid
preparation or introduced by PCR biases. With these conditions, we acquired T0 baselines of
>500 reads for 1,072 (97% of all) shRNAs. Sequence processing was performed using a
customized Galaxy platform31. For each shRNA and condition, the number of matching
reads was normalized to the total number of library-specific reads per lane and imported into
a database for further analysis (Access 2003, Microsoft). All shRNA sequences are provided
in Supplementary Table 1.

bioluminescent imaging, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg kg−1 D-Luciferin
(Goldbio), and after 10 min, analysed using an IVIS Spectrum system (Caliper
LifeSciences). Quantification was performed using Living Image software (Caliper
LifeSciences) with standardized rectangular regions of interests covering the mouse trunk
and extremities. For shRNA induction, animals were treated with doxycycline in both
drinking water (2 mg ml−1 with 2% sucrose; Sigma-Aldrich) and food (625 mg kg−1, Harlan
laboratories). For JQ1 treatment trials, a stock of 100 mg ml−1 JQ1 in DMSO was 20-fold

Plasmids
For conditional RNAi experiments, shRNAs were expressed from either the TRMPV-Neo
vector or the TtTMPV-Neo vector, which have been described previously10. For screen
validation, shRNAs were cloned into LMN(MSCV-miR30-PGK-NeoR-IRES-GFP), which
was generated from LMP32 by replacing the PuroR transgene with a NeoR cassette. For
Myc rescue experiments, the wild-type mouse Myc cDNA was subcloned into MSCV-PGKPuro-IRES-GFP (MSCV-PIG)33.
Cell culture
All mouse MLL-leukaemia cell lines were derived from bone marrow obtained from
terminally ill recipient mice, and were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco-Invitrogen)

medium. All human leukaemia cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, 100 U
ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, except KASUMI-1 cells, which were
cultured in 20% FBS. NOMO-1, MOLM-13, EoL-1, NB4, HNT-34 and CMK were

CD34+ cells as described previously34,35. All retroviral packaging was performed using
ecotropic Phoenix cells according to established protocols
(http://www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/tutorials/retpkg_1_packlines.html).
Western blotting

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For Brd4 immunoblotting, 30 μg of whole-cell lysate RIPA extracts (25 mM Tris (pH 7.6),
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) were loaded into each
lane. For Myc immunoblotting, cells were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer and about
50,000 cell-equivalents were loaded into each lane. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose for
blotting.
Proliferation assay
Competitive proliferation assays using shRNAs in LMN or TRMPV-/TtRMPV-Neo vectors
were performed as outlined in Supplementary Fig. 3a and as described previously10,
respectively. Proliferation assays for JQ1 in vitro testing were performed by counting the
increase in viable cell numbers over 72 h in the presence of different JQ1 concentrations.
Dead cells were excluded using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Measurements of cell
concentration were performed on a Guava Easycyte (Millipore), gating only viable cells
(FSC/SSC/PI−). Proliferation rates were calculated using the equation ln(cell concentration
at 72 h/cell concentration at 0 h)/72. Relative proliferation rates were calculated by
normalizing to the rate of DMSO-treated cells.
May–Grünwald–Giemsa cytospin staining

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells were treated with 1 ug ml−1 doxycycline for 2 days to
induce shRNA expression from TRMPV-Neo or TtTMPV vectors, or treated with 100 nM
JQ1 for 2 days. 50,000 cells were resuspended in 100 μl FACS buffer (5% FBS, 0.05%
NaN3 in PBS) and cytospun onto glass slides using a Shandon Cytospin 2 Centrifuge at 500
rpm for 5 min. May–Grünwald (Sigma) and Giemsa (Sigma) stainings were performed
according to manufacturer’s protocols. Images were collected using a Zeiss Observer
Microscope with a 340 objective.
BrdU cell-cycle analysis and annexin V flow cytometry
BrdU incorporation assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD,
APC BrdU flow kit), with cells pulsed with BrdU for 30 min. Cells were co-stained with 7aminoactinomycin D or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for DNA content
measurement. For all conditional shRNA experiments, the analysis was gated on Venus+/
dsRed+ (shRNA+) cell populations. Annexin V apoptosis staining was performed according

to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD, APC annexin V). To analyse shRNA-mediated
induction of apoptosis specifically, annexin V was quantified in viable shRNA-expressing
cells (FSC/SSC; Venus+/dsRed+). Notably, this gating selectively evaluates early apoptotic
cells (Annexin V+, DAPI−), excluding accumulated dead cells (Annexin V+, DAPI+). All
analyses were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
shRNA experiments in human AML cell lines
THP-1 and MOLM-13 cells were modified to express the ecotropic receptor and rtTA3
using retroviral transduction of MSCV-RIEP (MSCV-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-Puro)
followed by drug selection (0.5 and 1 ug ml−1 puromycin for 1 week, respectively). The
resulting cell lines were transduced with ecotropically packaged TRMPV-Neo-shRNA
retroviruses, selected with 400 μg ml−1 G418 for 1 week and treated with 1 μg ml−1
doxycycline to induce shRNA expression. The relative change in Venus+/dsRed+
(shRNA++) cells was monitored on a Guava Easycyte (Millipore). BrdU cell-cycle analysis
was performed as described above.
Adult primary leukaemia sample analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (ethics committee) of the
Medical University of Vienna. Primary leukaemic cells were obtained from peripheral blood
or bone marrow aspirate samples. Informed consent was obtained before blood donation or
bone marrow puncture in each case. Diagnoses were established according to criteria
provided by the French-American-British (FAB) cooperative study group36,37 and the World
Health Organization (WHO)38. Mononuclear cells were prepared using Ficoll and stored in
liquid nitrogen until used. HL60 and MOLM13 cell lines (obtained from DSMZ) were
included as controls. After thawing, the viability of AML cells ranged from 70% to 99% as
assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Primary cells (thawed mononuclear cells, 5–10 × 104
cells per well) and cell lines (1-5 × 104 cells per well) were cultured in 96-well microtitre
plates (TPP) in RPMI-1640 medium (PAA laboratories) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS,
Pasching) in the absence or presence of JQ1 (10–5,000 nM) at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 48 h. In
selected experiments, primary AML cells were incubated with JQ1 in the presence or
absence of a cocktail of proliferation-inducing cytokines: recombinant human (rh) G-CSF,
100 ng ml−1 (Amgen), rhSCF, 100 ng ml−1 (Peprotech) and rhIL-3, 100 ng ml−1 (Novartis).
After 48 h, 0.5 μCi 3H-thymidine was added (16 h). Cells were then harvested on filter
membranes in a Filtermate 196 harvester (Packard Bioscience). Filters were air-dried and
the bound radioactivity was measured in a β-counter (Top-Count NXT, Packard Bioscience).
All experiments were performed in triplicates. Proliferation was calculated as a percentage
of control (cells kept in control medium), and the inhibitory effects of JQ1 were expressed
as IC50 values. In 7 out of 12 patients, drug-exposed cells were analysed for morphologic
signs of differentiation by Wright-Giemsa staining on cytospin slides. The thymidine
incorporation assay was chosen as a proliferation assay because of its superior sensitivity
and ease of implementation for suspension cells, as compared to other proliferation assays,
such as MTT.
Paediatric primary leukaemia sample analysis
Diagnostic bone marrow samples were collected, under protocols approved by an
institutional review board, from newly diagnosed children with acute leukaemia. Informed
consent was obtained in accordance with the Helsinki protocol. At the time of collection,
primary leukaemic cells were enriched by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS
(GE Healthcare) and subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen. Vials of cryopreserved cells
were thawed, resuspended in media, and live leukaemic cells were enriched by density
centrifugation. Cells were maintained in supplemented media with 20% FBS. All leukaemia
cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Primary leukaemia samples were treated

with dose-ranges of JQ1 and vehicle control for 72 h in 96-well plates. For the annexin
binding assays, cells were harvested and stained with Annexin V-PEand 7-AAD (BD
Pharmingen), read on a FACSCalibur and analysed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). For
the WST-1 assays, WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was added to the culture medium
(1:10 dilution) and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Bio-Rad model 680
microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). WST-1 assays were performed in triplicate.
Primary leukaemia samples were treated with 250 nM JQ1 and vehicle control for 48 h in
96-well plates. Cytospins were prepared at baseline, 24 h and 48 h and stained with WrightGiemsa solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E600
microscope system (Nikon). Although similar to other metabolic assays measuring cell
proliferation (for example, MTT), WST-1 has superior sensitivity for the assessment of
cytotoxicity in primary leukaemia samples.
Histological analysis of bone marrow
Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Photographs
were taken on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with a Nikon Digital Sight camera using
NIS-Elements F2.30 software at a resolution of 2560 × 1920. Using Adobe Photoshop CS2,
images were re-sized and set at a resolution of 300 pixels inch−1, autocontrast was applied
and unsharp mask was used to improve image clarity.

FACS evaluation of normal haematopoiesis
Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing mouse femurs and tibias, followed by
erythrocyte lysis with ACK buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA).
Samples were washed in FACS buffer (5% FBS, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS), followed by staining
(two million cells in 100 μl of FACS buffer) for 1 h. Antibody dilutions used were: mouse
haematopoietic lineage eFluor 450 cocktail (1:100), PE-Cy7 anti-mouse Kit (1:50), APC
anti-mouse Sca-1 (1:100), APC anti-mouse B220 (1:100), APC anti-mouse Cd11b (1:100),
APC anti-mouse TER-119 (1:100) and APC anti-mouse Gr-1 (1:100). Stained samples were
analysed on an LSRII flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software
(Treestar).
Expression microarrays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Microarrays were performed through the CSHL microarray shared resource. RNA was
isolated from 107 cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed on an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser, RNA 6000 Pico Series II Chips (Agilent) and samples with a RIN
score of 7.0 or greater passed. RNA was amplified by a modified Eberwine technique,
amplified antisense RNA was then converted to cDNA using a WT Expression kit
(Ambion). The cDNA was then fragmented and terminally labelled with biotin, using the
Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labelling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were then prepared
for hybridization, hybridized, washed and scanned according to the manufacturer’s
instructions on Mouse Gene ST 1.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix). Affymetrix Expression
Console QC metrics were used to pass the image data. Raw data was processed by
Affymetrix and Limma packages in R-based Bioconductor. Heatmaps were generated using
GenePattern software39; RMA-processed microarray data was converted into a log2 scale,
selected gene lists were row-normalized and visualized using the HeatMapImage module on
GenePattern. All raw microarray data files are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GSE29799).
GSEA analysis
Gene set enrichment analysis20 was performed using GSEA v2.07 software with 1,000
phenotype permutations. Leukaemia-stem-cell and Myc gene sets were obtained from the

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 April 17.

indicated publications21,22,26. The macrophage-development gene set was obtained from the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity). To perform GSEA on human
microarray data, mouse gene sets were converted into human gene names using bioDBNet
dbWalk (http://biodbnet.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/db/dbWalk.php) or manually using the NCBI
database. A detailed description of GSEA methodology and interpretation is provided at
http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html. In brief, the
normalized enrichment score (NES) provides ‘the degree to which a gene set is
overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes’. The false discovery rate qvalue (FDR q-val) is ‘the estimated probability that a gene set with a given NES represents a
false positive finding’. ‘In general, given the lack of coherence in most expression datasets
and the relatively small number of gene sets being analyzed, an FDR cutoff of 25% is
appropriate.’ Gene sets used in this study are included in Supplementary Table 2.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
ChIP assays were performed exactly as described40. Crosslinking was performed with
sequential EGS (Pierce) and formaldehyde41. All results were quantified by quantitative
PCR performed using SYBR green (ABI) on an ABI 7900HT. Each immunoprecipitate
signal was referenced to an input standard-curve dilution series (immunoprecipitate/input) to
normalize for differences in starting cell number and for primer amplification efficiency.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

qRT–PCR
RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Synthesis of cDNA was performed
using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences). Quantitative PCR analysis was
performed on an ABI 7900HT with SYBR green (ABI). All signals were quantified using
the ΔCt method. All signals were normalized to the levels of Gapdh.
Antibodies
The anti-Brd4 antibody used for western blotting was a gift from G. Blobel. The anti-Brd4
antibody used for ChIP was purchased from Sigma (HPA015055). The anti-Myc antibody
was purchased from Epitomics (1472-1). Antibodies used in FACS were: APC anti-mouse
CD117/Kit (Biolegend, 105811), APC anti-mouse CD11b (Biolegend, 101211), Pacific Blue
anti-mouse CD45.2 (Biolegend, 109820), mouse haematopoietic lineage eFluor 450 cocktail

with DMSO or 250 nM JQ1. A representative experiment of three biological replicates is
shown. c, qRT–PCRtime course at indicated time points after treatment of MLL-AF9/
NrasG12D leukaemia cells with 250 nM JQ1. Results were normalized toGapdh, with the
relative mRNA level in untreated cells set to 1 (n = 3). d, ChIP–qPCR performed in MLLAF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells with the indicated antibodies and PCR primer locations (n =
6 for DMSO; n = 4 for JQ1-treated). TSS, transcription start site. e, Western blotting of
whole-cell lysates prepared from MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells transduced with
empty vector or a Myc-cDNA-containing MSCV retrovirus. Cells were treated for 48 h with
DMSO or 250 nM JQ1. A representative experiment of three biological replicates is shown.
f, Light microscopy of May–Grünwald/Giemsa-stained MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells
transduced with an empty vector or with the Myc cDNA. Cells were treated for 5 days with
50 nM JQ1 and imaged using a×40 objective. A representative image of three biological
replicates is shown. g, Quantification of BrdU incorporation after a 30-min pulse in MLLAF9/NrasG12D leukaemia cells transduced with empty control vector or the Myc cDNA.
Cells were treated with JQ1 for 5 days at the indicated concentrations (n = 3). All error bars
shown represent s.e.m.
