Abstract
Acetyl-keto-B-boswellic acid (AKBA), a triterpenoid isolated
from Boswellia carterri Birdw and Boswellia serrata, has
been found to inhibit tumor cell growth and to induce
apoptosis. The apoptotic effects and the mechanisms of
action of AKBA were studied in LNCaP and PC-3 human
prostate cancer cells. AKBA induced apoptosis in both cell
lines at concentrations above 10 Mg/mL. AKBA-induced
apoptosis was correlated with the activation of caspase-3
and caspase-8 as well as with poly(ADP)ribose polymerase
(PARP) cleavage. The activation of caspase-8 was correlated
with increased levels of death receptor (DR) 5 but not of Fas
or DR4. AKBA-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 activation, and
PARP cleavage were inhibited by knocking down DR5 using a
small hairpin RNA. AKBA treatment increased the levels of
CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)
and activated a DR5 promoter reporter but did not activate a
DR5 promoter reporter with the mutant CHOP binding site.
These results suggest that AKBA induces apoptosis in
prostate cancer cells through a DR5-mediated pathway,
which probably involves the induced expression of CHOP.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer and is the
third leading cause of cancer death of males in the United States
(1). Two of the common treatments for prostate cancer, hormone
ablation and endocrine therapy, lead to temporary palliation, but
relapse frequently occurs 1 to 2 years after initiating treatment (2).
The reduction of androgen stimulation in prostatic cells is one of
the main treatment strategies for this disease (3). Thus, strategies
to find agents that act by different mechanisms are needed to
improve prostate cancer therapy.
Decreasing apoptotic cell death seems to be one of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis (4). Two principle types of apoptotic
pathways have been described: mitochondria-dependent and
death receptor–dependent pathways (5, 6). Many cells undergo a
reduction in mitochondria membrane potential before they exhibit
signs of nuclear apoptosis after treatment with chemotherapeutic
agents (7). However, chemotherapy alone has not been shown to
have a beneficial therapeutic effect in prostate cancer patients (8).

domain’’–containing molecules form an emerging family of
membrane death receptors that transduce apoptotic signals
(9, 10). This family contains six members: TNF-R1, Fas, death
receptor (DR)3, DR4, DR5, and DR6. These receptors contain an
extracellular region with a varying number of cysteine-rich
domains and an intracellular region that contains a ‘‘death
domain’’. The ligands for these receptors include TNF-a, Fas L,
Apo3L, and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). Agents
that activate the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway may
have a therapeutic effect in prostate cancer (11). Prostate cancer
cells are responsive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and several agents
induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by activation of the death
receptor–mediated apoptotic pathway (12–14).
Acetyl-keto-h-boswellic acid (AKBA) is one of the main
components of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and Boswellia
carterri Birdw. Boswellic acids, including boswellic acid acetate
(BAA) and AKBA, were found to be nonredox, noncompetitive
specific inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase and topoisomerases (15–19).
AKBA has been reported to induce apoptosis in several types
of tumor cells including colon, prostate, and malignant glioma
(19–26). Previously, we have found that BAA induced apoptosis
in myeloid leukemia cells by activation of caspases independent
of reactive oxygen species (27). In this study, androgenindependent and androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines,
PC-3 and LNCaP, respectively, were used to study the effects of
AKBA on apoptosis induction and to explore the mechanism of
action. Both cell lines were sensitive to AKBA-induced apoptosis
that correlated with the activation of caspase-8 and the upregulation of DR5 protein. Silencing DR5 with small hairpin RNA
(shRNA) blocked AKBA-induced apoptosis. It was found that
AKBA induced DR5 expression transcriptionally through increasing expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous
protein (CHOP). AKBA activated the DR5 promoter reporter, and
the DR5 promoter reporter with a mutant CHOP binding site
lost its response to AKBA treatment. Our results suggest that
AKBA induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through a DR5mediated pathway, which is probably mediated by the induced
expression of CHOP protein.

Acetyl-Keto-b-Boswellic Acid and Apoptosis Induction
Cell lines and culture. The human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and
LNCaP, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and
maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. Cells (2  103) were plated in each well of a 96-well
plate and were allowed to adhere and spread for 24 h. Then various
concentrations of AKBA were added, and the cells were cultured for
4 days at 37jC. MTT solution (50 AL of 2 mg/mL) was added per well,
and the cultures were continued for an additional 4 h. The medium was
aspirated, the cells were dissolved in 200 AL DMSO, and the absorbance
at 570 nm was determined in each well with a 96-well plate reader.
The growth of the treated cells was compared with that of untreated
cells.
Apoptosis assay. DNA fragmentation was determined by labeling DNA
strand breaks with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL assay;
ref. 28). The TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (PharMingen). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a
FACScan. All data were collected, stored, and analyzed by LYSIS II software
(Becton Dickinson).
Mitochondria membrane potential assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined with a Mitochondrial Membrane Sensor
kit as described by the manufacturer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.).
Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h before AKBA
treatment. After treatment, the cells were washed with serum-free
medium and incubated with 1 mL diluted BD MitoSensor reagent at
37jC in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator for 15 to 20 min. Then the cells
were gently rinsed with 1 PBS and examined under a microscope using
a band-pass filter. The MitoSensor reagent aggregates in the mitochondria of healthy cells that were fluorescence orange. When mitochondrial
membrane potentials are altered, the MitoSensor reagent does not
accumulate in the mitochondria and remains as monomers in the
cytoplasm where it fluorescences green (27).
Plasmid preparation for shRNA and transfection. The DR5 and LacZ
pENTR/U6 shRNA entry vector were constructed following the description
of the instruction manual (Invitrogen). The LacZ shRNA was used as a
control. In brief, two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides were
synthesized and annealed with an encoding shRNA of DR5 or LacZ, then
the double-stranded oligo was cloned into the pENTR/U6 vector. The
vectors were used to transfect LNCaP and PC-3 cells with Lipofectamine
2000. The relative levels of DR4 and DR5 in shRNA-transfected LNCaP cells
were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The target sequence of DR5 was
AAGACCCTTGTGCTCGTTGTC.
Luciferase assay. The pGL3/DR4 ( 1773/+63) promoter reporter
plasmid was obtained from Dr. S-Y Sun (Emory University School of
Medicine, Atlanta, GA; ref. 29). Plasmids of pDR5/ 1188, pDR5/ 437, and
pDR5/mt CHOP were obtained from Dr. T. Sakai (Kyoto Prefectural
University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan; ref. 30). The pCH110 plasmid that
codes h-galactosidase was cotransfected into PC-3 and LNCaP cells using
Lipofectmine 2000 (31). The cells were treated with or without AKBA
(10 Ag/mL) for 24 h and then harvested for luciferase activity assay. Levels
of luciferase activity were normalized with that of h-gal activity. The
luciferase activity assay was carried out with TD-20/20 Luminometer
(Turner Designs) using a luciferase assay kit (Promega).
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA isolation was performed using the
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared using an oligo(dT) primer
and Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) following
standard protocols. Primers used in these experiments were as follows:
DR5, 5¶-ATGAGATCGTGAGTATCTTGCAGC-3¶ and 5¶- TGACCCACTTTATCAGCATCGTGT-3¶; and b-actin, 5¶-ATCCACGAAACTACCTTCAACTC-3¶
and 5¶-CTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGCT-3¶. After reverse transcription,
the cDNA product was amplified by PCR with three units of Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega) and 2.5 mmol/L Mg2+, using standard protocols at
annealing temperature of 55jC.
Western blot analysis was done as described previously (32), and the
contents of TRAIL in the medium were determined using TRAIL ELISA kit
(Alexis Biochemicals) following the protocol.

Results
AKBA inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in both
LNCaP and PC-3 cells in an androgen-independent fashion.
The cell growth inhibitory effects of AKBA in LNCaP and PC-3 cells
were determined using the MTT assay. Both LNCaP and PC-3 cells
were responsive to AKBA treatment (Fig. 1A). AKBA at 10 Ag/mL
inhibited nearly 80% of cell growth in both cell lines after
treatment for 4 days. The apoptotic effects of AKBA in both cell
lines were determined using the TUNEL assay. AKBA induced
apoptosis at a concentration of 20 Ag/mL after 24 h of treatment
(Fig. 1B). Because both LNCaP (androgen receptor–positive) and
PC-3 (androgen receptor–negative) cells are sensitive to AKBA
apoptosis induction, it suggests that AKBA inhibits cell growth and
induces apoptosis through a pathway independent of androgen
receptor activity.
AKBA activates caspase-8 and caspase-3 in both LNCaP and
PC-3 cells. To investigate the mechanisms of AKBA-induced
apoptosis, the levels of caspase-8 and caspase-3 proteins as well as
their cleave fragments were determined. AKBA at a concentration
of 20 Ag/mL decreased the levels of caspase-8 and caspase-3
protein and resulted in the formation of cleave fragments (the
activated forms of both enzymes; Fig. 2A). Correlated with the
activation of caspase-3, one of its substrate, PARP, was cleaved.
Caspase-8 has been found to activate caspase-3 either directly or
indirectly through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway (33). The
mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) was determined in PC-3
cells after AKBA treatment using MitoSensor Reagent. MitoSensor
Reagent accumulated in the mitochondria and fluorescenced orange
in untreated cells and cells treated with AKBA at 10 Ag/mL.

Figure 2. AKBA activates caspase-3 and
caspase-8 and decreases MMP. A, protein levels. The
protein levels of caspase-3, caspase-8, PARP, and
their cleavage fragments were determined using
Western blot analysis. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were
treated with AKBA at the indicated concentrations for
24 h. B, MMP. PC-3 cells were treated with AKBA at
10 or 20 Ag/mL for 12 h. MMP was determined
using the MitoSensor Reagent as described in
Materials and Methods. C, the inhibition of AKBAinduced decrease of MMP by caspase inhibitors. PC-3
cells were treated with 20 Ag/mL AKBA for 12 h after
pretreatment with or without 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-CMK
(a general caspase inhibitor) or IETD-CHO
(a caspase-8 inhibitor) for 4 h. D, the inhibition of
AKBA-induced cleavage of PARP by caspase
inhibitors. PC-3 cells were treated with 20 Ag/mL AKBA
for 12 h after pretreatment with or without 50 Amol/L
Z-VAD-CMK or IETD-CHO for 4 h.

AKBA at 20 Ag/mL decreased the MMP and blocked the
MitoSensor Reagent accumulation in the mitochondria fluorescencing green (Fig. 2B). The decrease of MMP and the cleavage
of PARP due to AKBA treatment were completely inhibited by
pretreatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor, IETD-CHO, or a general
caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-CMK (Fig. 2C and D). These data
suggest that the activation of caspase-8 plays an important role in
AKBA-induced apoptosis.
AKBA increases the levels of TRAIL and DR5 in both LNCaP
and PC-3 cells. Caspase-8 is activated by a death receptor–
mediated pathway (33). To determine the pathways of the AKBAinduced caspase-8 activation, the levels of DR4, DR5, TRAIL, and
Fas were determined using Western blot analyses. The levels of
TRAIL and DR5, but not DR4, were increased after AKBA
treatment. AKBA increased the levels of TRAIL protein after
AKBA treatment as short as 2 h, and then the levels of TRAIL
protein remained constant until 24 h (Fig. 3). AKBA increased
the levels of DR5 protein after 8 h of AKBA treatment, and the
levels continued to increase as the AKBA treatment was prolonged
(Fig. 3). The levels of Fas were transiently increased after AKBA
treatment for 2 to 4 h and then decreased to the basal levels at 8 h
in PC-3 cells and at 24 h in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3). The levels of
DR4 were not changed after AKBA treatment for 24 h (Fig. 3).
To determine whether AKBA induced apoptosis through ligation
activation of DR5 by released TRAIL in AKBA-treated cells, a

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

TRAIL receptor FC chimeric protein that block DR5 activation by
TRAIL was used, and it was found that TRAIL receptor FC
chimeric protein did not attenuate AKBA-induced apoptosis in
both PC-3 and LNCaP cells (data not shown). In addition, the
levels of TRAIL in the cultured medium of cells treated by AKBA
were not increased (data not shown). These data suggest that
AKBA may induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through the
increased levels of DR5 protein independent of TRAIL ligation
activation.
Knockdown of DR5 attenuates AKBA-induced apoptosis in
LNCaP and PC-3 cells. To determine the role of DR5 in AKBAinduced apoptosis, DR5 was knocked down using shRNA. DR5
shRNA selectively knocked down DR5 protein but not DR4 protein
in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4A). The basal as well as the AKBA-induced
levels of DR5 were decreased by the transfection of DR5 shRNA.
Correlated with the decrease in the levels of DR5 protein by DR5
shRNA, the cleavages of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP due to
AKBA treatment were inhibited. Using TUNEL assay, it was found
that AKBA-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells was completed
inhibited by DR5 shRNA (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that the
induced expression of DR5 protein indeed plays a pivotal role in
AKBA-induced apoptosis.
Up-regulation of DR5 by AKBA correlates with the
increased expression of CHOP. DR5 has been found to be
regulated through a nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), a p53, and/or a

c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)-mediated pathway (34–38). To determine
if NF-nB plays a role in AKBA-mediated DR5 up-regulation, the
p65 nuclear translocation and the levels of InBa protein were
determined in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. AKBA at 20 Ag/mL
did not induce p65 nuclear translocation nor did it decrease the
levels of InBa protein (Fig. 5A). To determine if p53 is involved in
AKBA-induced apoptosis, the levels of p53 and its phosphorylated
form were determined in both cell lines. LNCaP cells, but
not PC-3 cells, express p53 (Fig. 5B). The levels of p53 and
phosphorylated p53 were weakly up-regulated by AKBA treatment
in LNCaP cells but not in PC-3 cells (Fig. 5B). To determine if the
JNK pathway is involved in DR5 regulation, the levels of
phosphorylated c-jun were analyzed in both cell lines. The levels
of phosphorylated c-jun were increased with AKBA treatment,
suggesting that JNK is activated. It has been found that JNK upregulates CHOP, and DR5 is a CHOP-responsive gene (30, 36, 39).
Thus, the levels of CHOP were determined in both cell lines after
AKBA treatment, and it was found that the levels of CHOP
protein were increased in both cell lines after AKBA treatment
(Fig. 5B). JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated the induction of
CHOP and DR5 proteins as well as PARP cleavage in both cell
lines (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that AKBA increases the levels
of DR5 protein through pathways involving JNK activation and
CHOP induction.
AKBA increases the mRNA levels of DR5 and activates the
DR5 promoter through a CHOP-mediated pathway. To
determine if AKBA up-regulate DR5 protein transcriptionally,
the levels of DR5 mRNA were determined using reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The levels of DR5 mRNA were

with LacZ (control) or DR5 shRNA. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were
treated with AKBA at 10 or 20 Ag/mL for 24 h. Then the levels of DR4, DR5,
caspaspe-3, caspase-8, and PARP proteins were compared using Western blot
analyses. B, TUNEL assay. PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with LacZ

increased in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells after AKBA treatment
(Fig. 6A). The activation of DR4 and DR5 promoter reporters by
AKBA treatment were determined. The basal level of promoter
activity of DR5 was higher than that of DR4 after transfection
into both cell lines. AKBA treatment significantly increased the
activity of the DR5 promoter reporter, but not that of the DR4
promoter reporter, in both cell lines (Fig. 6B). To test if the
activation of the DR5 promoter reporter is mediated through
CHOP, the DR5 promoter with a mutant CHOP binding site was
used. AKBA activated the DR5 promoter reporter with the wildtype CHOP binding site but did not activate DR5 promoter
reporter with the mutant CHOP binding site (Fig. 6C). These data
suggest that AKBA up-regulates DR5 at a transcriptional level,
and that CHOP plays an important role in the AKBA-induced
DR5 expression.

Discussion
Figure 3. AKBA up-regulates the levels of DR5 and TRAIL, but not DR4,
proteins in both LNCaP (A ) and PC-3 (B) cells. The levels of TRAIL, Fas, DR4,
and DR5 proteins were compared with Western blot analyses. Cells were treated
with AKBA at 20 Ag/mL for the indicated times, and the protein levels were
determined using specific antibodies.

natural products do induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, at
least in part, by activation of the death receptor–mediated
pathway (13, 14, 41, 42). Boswellic acids, including AKBA and
BAA isolated from gum resin of B. serrata and B. carterri Birdw,
have been found to have apoptosis induction ability in cancer cells
(20, 24, 26). Although AKBA has been reported to induce apoptosis
in several tumor cell lines, the mechanisms of its action are not
clear. In this study, we found that AKBA induced apoptosis
through the death receptor–mediated pathway in prostate cancer
cells.
By using androgen receptor–positive LNCaP and androgen
receptor–negative PC-3 cells, we found that AKBA inhibited cell
growth and induced apoptosis in both cell lines (Fig. 1). These
data suggest that AKBA may not act through interfering with the
androgen signaling pathway. Because AKBA induced apoptosis in
both cell lines, the apoptosis induction ability of AKBA should be,

translocation of p65 and InBa proteins. The levels of p65 and InBa proteins in

24 h. B, the levels of phosphorylated p53 (p-p53), p53, phosphorylated c-Jun

cell lysates were analyzed in Western blots. C, JNK inhibitor SP600125
attenuated AKBA-induced expression of DR5 and CHOP proteins as well as
PARP cleavage. Cells were treated with AKBA at 20 Ag/mL for 24 h in presence
or absence of SP600125 (20 Amol/L), and proteins were viewed after Western
blotting.

at least, one of its mechanisms of inhibiting prostate cancer cell
growth. p53 has been shown to play an important role in
apoptosis induction (43). LNCaP cells express p53, but PC-3 cells
do not (Fig. 5B). Although AKBA increased the levels of phosphop53 in LNCaP cells, AKBA equally induced apoptosis in both cell
lines without induction of p53 in PC-3 cells. These data suggest
that apoptosis induction of AKBA, at least in PC-3 cells, is
through a p53-independent pathway.
Caspase activation plays pivotal roles in both mitochondria
and death receptor–mediated pathways (44). AKBA treatment
activates caspase-3 and caspase-8 and results in PARP cleavage
(Fig. 2). Caspase-8 has been shown to play an important role in
both mitochondria- and death receptor–mediated pathways (45).
AKBA induces the activation of caspase-8 activity and decreases
MMP (Fig. 2). Because AKBA-induced apoptosis and decrease in
MMP are both diminished after pretreatment with the caspase8 inhibitor IETD-CHO, activated caspase-8 seems to be a key factor
in the pathway involved in AKBA-mediated apoptosis process
(Fig. 2). The activation of caspase-8 has been found to be mediated
by the increased expression of a death receptor and/or ligation of a
receptor with its ligand (6). It has been reported that boswellic acid
activated caspase-8 independent of Fas/FasL interaction in colon
cancer cells (46). Consistent with this report, we observed that Fas
was only transiently induced after AKBA treatment in PC-3 cells
(Fig. 3B). These data suggest that Fas would not be a key factor in
mediating AKBA-induced apoptosis. Previously, we found that BAA
increased the levels of both DR4 and DR5 expression in leukemia
cells (27). We reported here that the levels of DR5 protein but not of
DR4 protein were induced by AKBA treatment in both prostate
cancer cell lines (Fig. 3). The induced expression of DR5 correlates
with AKBA-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of DR5 blocked AKBAinduced activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3, PARP cleavage, and
apoptosis (Fig. 4). Interestingly, because intracellular TRAIL levels
are also increased after AKBA treatment (Fig. 3), TRAIL ligation to
DR5 may also participate in AKBA-induced apoptosis. To prove this
possibility, we have determined the levels of TRAIL in the medium
of cells treated by AKBA and the blockage of TRAIL Receptor 2/Fc
Chimera on AKBA-induced apoptosis. It was found that the levels
of TRAIL were not increased in medium of cells treated with AKBA,
and that TRAIL Receptor 2/Fc Chimera did not block AKBAinduced apoptosis. These data suggest that the up-regulation of
DR5 protein but not TRAIL ligation plays an important role in
AKBA-induced apoptosis.
Because AKBA increases the levels of DR5 mRNA in both
LNCaP and PC-3 cells, it suggests that AKBA up-regulates DR5 at
a transcriptional level (Fig. 6A). DR5 can be regulated by several
factors including p53, NF-nB, JNK, and CHOP (34–38). Because
AKBA induces the expression of DR5 in PC-3 cells, which do not
express p53, it is possible that AKBA induces DR5 expression
through a p53-independent pathway, at least in PC-3 cells.
Inhibition of NF-nB activation has been thought to play a role in
the apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory effects of AKBA
(18, 23, 26). Surprisingly, AKBA at concentrations, which increased
the levels of DR5 protein, did not induce p65 nuclear translocation nor decrease the levels of InBa protein (Fig. 5). Thus, it
seems that the induced expression of DR5 by AKBA may not be
mediated by the inhibition of NF-nB activation.
Recently, CHOP has been considered to play an important role
in regulating DR5 expression, and a CHOP binding site has been
identified in DR5 promoter (36). CHOP was induced by AKBA
treatment in both cell lines that was correlated with the

induction DR5 protein (Fig. 5C). AKBA activated a DR5 promoter
reporter but did not activate a DR5 promoter reporter with a
mutant CHOP binding site (Fig. 6). These data suggest that AKBA
induces DR5 expression via a CHOP-mediated pathway. Several
agents, such as AKBA, have been shown to up-regulate DR5
expression through an induction of CHOP expression (30, 47, 48).
The mechanisms of CHOP activation by these agents are unclear.
Our study suggests that CHOP could be activated by a JNKmediated pathway. AKBA increased the levels of phosphorylated
c-jun, and that a JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated AKBAinduced expression of both CHOP and DR5 protein as well as
