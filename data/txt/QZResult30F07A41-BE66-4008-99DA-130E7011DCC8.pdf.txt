ABSTRACT
Most anticancer drugs are not able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
effectively while surgery and radiation therapy cannot eradicate brain glioma cells
and glioma stem cells (GSCs), hence resulting in poor prognosis with high recurrence
rates. In the present study, a kind of multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus
quinacrine liposomes was developed for treating brain glioma and GSCs. Evaluations
were performed on in-vitro BBB model, murine glioma cells, GSCs, and GSCs bearing
mice. Results showed that the multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes exhibited evident capabilities in crossing the BBB, in killing glioma cells
and GSCs and in diminishing brain glioma in mice. Action mechanism studies indicated
that the enhanced efficacy of the multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded liposomes
could be due to the following aspects: evading the rapid elimination from blood
circulation; crossing the BBB effectively; improving drug uptake by glioma cells and
GSCs; down-regulating the overexpressed ABC transporters; inducing apoptosis of
GSCs via up-regulating apoptotic receptor/ligand (Fas/Fasl), activating apoptotic
enzymes (caspases 8, 9 and 3), activating pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bok),
activating tumor suppressor protein (P53) and suppressing anti-apoptotic proteins
(Bcl-2 and Mcl-1). In conclusion, the multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus
quinacrine liposomes could be used as a potential therapy for treating brain glioma
and GSCs.

INTRODUCTION

eradicate brain glioma cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs),
thus leading to high recurrence rates. Therefore, there is an
urgent need for developing a new chemotherapy strategy
to overcome the limitations.
The BBB is a highly selective permeability
barrier, and formed by capillary endothelial cells that
are connected by tight junctions, which are composed
of transmembrane proteins, occludin, claudins, and
junctional adhesion molecules, etc. This “barrier” restricts
the passage of solutes and anticancer agents. Nevertheless,
physiological substances could cross the BBB by passive
diffusion of small molecules, such as water and oxygen; by
transporter mediated transport of polar molecule nutrients,

Malignant brain glioma is the most lethal and
aggressive type of cancer in oncology with a median
survival of only 14.6 months and a 5-year survival
rate of less than 5% [1, 2]. Treatment for brain glioma
depends on the location, the cell type and the grade of
malignancy. Usually, treatment is a combined approach,
using surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
However, the prognosis for patients is generally poor due
to its pathological features. Most anticancer drugs are not
able to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) effectively
[3]. Furthermore, surgery and radiation therapy cannot

such as amino acids and glucose; and by receptor mediated
transport of large endogenic molecules, such as insulin and
hormone [4]. These suggest that the drug carrier with a
suitable unlocking key may be able to cross the BBB by
opening the “door”, while the targeting strategy offers a
likely unlocking key.
This poor prognosis of brain glioma is also due to
therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence after surgical
removal. Moreover, a relatively quiescent subset of
endogenous glioma cells, i.e., GSCs, is responsible for
relapse through the production of transient populations of
highly proliferative cells [5]. GSCs being dormant state are
highly drug-resistant to regular chemotherapies and make
cell cycle specific anticancer drugs in vain. Furthermore,
GSCs highly express ATP-binding cassette transporters
(ABC transporters), which efflux the internalized drugs
from the GSCs.
Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a lectin that
protects wheat from insects, yeast and bacteria. An
agglutinin protein binds to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and
sialic acid, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in the natural
environment of wheat is found in the chitin of insects, and
the cell membrane of yeast and bacteria [6]. Investigations
reveal that WGA has the potential to transfer drug across
the BBB mediated by adsorptive endocytosis [7]. In
addition, WGA can specifically bind to membraneassociated glycoproteins highly expressed on cancer and
cancer stem cells [8]. These suggest that WGA may be a
suitable targeting ligand to transport drug carriers across
the BBB and further to target glioma cells and GSCs.
Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antagonist of estrogen
receptor in breast tissue but an agonist in other tissues
such as the endometrium. It is used in the conventional
anti-estrogen therapy for hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer in pre-menopausal women [9]. TAM has
shown the capability to circumvent multi-drug resistance

Zeta potential
(mV)

(MDR) by blocking drug efflux due to overexpressed ABC
transporters in cancer cells [10]. Our previous studies also
demonstrated that TAM could be used for improving the
transport of drug across the BBB [11].
Daunorubicin is widely used in treating a variety of
cancers [12]. The underlying mechanism that daunorubicin
takes effects is mainly by interfering DNA and RNA
synthesis in the cellular nuclei [13]. Quinacrine has been
used as an antiprotozoal, antirheumatic and an intrapleural
sclerosing agent. Previous reports have demonstrated that
quinacrine could potentially induce apoptosis in many
tumor cells, including cervical carcinoma [14], gastric
cancer [15], and neck squamous carcinoma [16]. Besides,
quinacrine has also shown the capability to induce
apoptosis of breast cancer stem cells [17].
Therefore, we hypothesized that the multifunctional
targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes modified
with WGA and TAM could be able to cross the BBB, and
kill glioma cells and GSCs. In the liposomes, TAM was
incorporated into the lipid bilayer for blocking the drug
efflux transporters which overexpressed on the BBB
and GSCs, and WGA was modified on the surface of the
liposomes for crossing the BBB and further targeting
glioma cells and GSCs. Daunorubicin and quinacrine
were entrapped into the liposomes as anticancer drug and
an apoptosis-inducing agent, respectively. The objectives
of the present study were to construct the multifunctional
targeting liposomes, and to characterize the anticancer
efficacy for treating brain glioma and GSCs.

demonstrated that the multifunctional targeting liposomes
were round shaped with smooth surface. Fig. 1C and 1D
show the release rates of daunorubicin and quinacrine
from varying liposomal formulations. Results exhibited
that the release rates of daunorubicin and quinacrine from
these liposomes were less than 5% within the initial 4 h.
For multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded liposomes, the
in vitro release rate of daunorubicin was 19.46 ± 4.25% at
48 h, and that of quinacrine was 16.80 ± 1.37% at 48 h.
The amount of WGA molecules presented in one liposome
particle was calculated to be 1.26 × 103.
Table 1 lists the characterization of the
multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded liposomes. In
all types of liposomes, the encapsulation efficiencies of
daunorubicin or quinacine were >90%, respectively. The
coupling rates of TAM and WGA were > 90% and > 88%,
respectively. Average particle sizes of all liposomes were
approximately in the range of 100-106 nm with a narrow

transporters in glioma cells (ABCB1 = 0.50 ± 0.06,
ABCC1 = 0.26 ± 0.10, and ABCG2 = 0.57 ± 0.01) were
evidently lower than those in GSCs (ABCB1, ABCC1
or ABCG2 = 1, respectively). After treatment with
multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded liposomes for 24
h, expression ratios of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in
GSCs were lowered to be 0.63 ± 0.07, 0.30 ± 0.08 and

of multifunctional targeting DiR liposomes, a strong
DiR fluorescent signal was observed in the whole blood

of free DiR, the fluorescent signal was rapidly distributed

through the leaky vasculature with 100-600 nm pores in
the aggressive tumors by an enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect [22].The delayed drug release
will be beneficial for preventing rapid leakage during the
process of drug delivery and increasing accumulation of
the drug into the tumor masses.
In this study, GSCs are cultured and exist as
spheroids in serum-free medium, and the spheroids are
proven to have stem-like characteristics with high level
of nestin (marked as nestin+, 93.55%) as compared with
isotype control (Fig. 2B1 and 2B2). The targeting effects
of multifunctional targeting liposomes are evidenced in
the cellular uptake by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A and 3B),
and the cellular distribution by confocal observation
(Fig. 3C). The semi-quantitative flow cytometry
demonstrates that the addition of WGA and TAM can
significantly promote cellular uptake of the liposomes in
both glioma cells and GSCs. The cellular distribution of
multifunctional targeting liposomes is observed with a
confocal method. Results show that the multifunctional
targeting daunorubicin liposomes exhibit stronger purple
fluorescence compared with daunorubicin liposomes.
This phenomenon can be associated with the receptormediated endocytosis by WGA, which is modified onto
the liposomal surface and displays high binding specificity
with the sugar moiety of GSCs. The confocal results of
targeting effects are consistent with those observed by
cellular uptake.
In cytotoxic assays, multifunctional targeting
daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes exhibit the
strongest inhibitory effects on both glioma cells and
GSCs (Fig. 4A and 4B). This is attributed to an enhanced
cellular uptake of the targeting liposomes. Compared with
daunorubicin liposomes, stronger inhibitory effects are
also observed on glioma cells and GSCs after treatment
with daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes, indicating
that quinacrine can enhance anticancer effects possibly by
inducing apoptosis of cancer cells.
In the study, BMVECs are used to build the BBB
model, and the tight junctions are evaluated by TEER
values [23]. TEER values are monitored during the whole
process of experiments to make sure there is no leakage,
thus guaranteeing accuracy of the BBB model. Results
indicate that the liposomes modified with TAM, WGA or
both evidently improve transport of drugs across the BBB
(Fig. 4C and 4D).
A family of ABC transporters have been
characterized to act specific physiological functions
such as ABCA1 for cholesterol efflux onto high-density
lipoproteins, while only a few of ABC transporters are
identified to be responsible for multidrug resistance by
efflux of drug from cancer cells, such as ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2, etc. [24]. In the present study, these drug
efflux-pump transporters are inferred to be associated with
drug-resistance of GSCs, and accordingly, are selected
for experimental observation. The results display that the

DISCUSSION
Malignant brain glioma, being usually recrudescent
after resection, is the most lethal and aggressive type of
cancer in oncology [18, 19]. Results of previous studies
show that chemotherapy does not significantly prolong
the survival of patients with brain glioma because of the
existence of BBB, which restricts the movement of most
molecules and anticancer drugs from blood to brain [20,
21]. Another reason is the existence of the GSCs, which
cannot be eradicated completely by surgery and radiation
therapy. Consequently, a kind of multifunctional targeting
daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes was developed
in the present study aimed at crossing the BBB, and
eliminating glioma cells and GSCs.
In the multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus
quinacrine liposomes, WGA is coupled on the surface
of the liposomes by conjugating with DSPE-PEG2000NHS, and TAM is inserted into the phospholipid bilayer
as the multifunctional targeting ligands. Daunorubicin
and quinacrine are encapsulated in the aqueous core of
the liposome. Physicochemical characterizations of the
multifunctional targeting liposomes are performed on
the following aspects: high encapsulation efficiencies,
small and well-distributed particle size (Table 1), smooth
surface (Fig. 1B1 and 1B2), and delayed drug release
(Fig. 1C and 1D). The high encapsulation efficiencies
of the multifunctional targeting liposomes permit
more drugs to be transported across the BBB with the
functionalized carriers. The particle size of the liposomes
can be beneficial for passive delivery to tumor interstitium

expression ratios of the ABC transporters are distinctly
different between glioma cells and GSCs before drug
treatments, and the expression ratios of ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2 in GSCs are down-regulated significantly
after treatment with multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded
liposomes (Fig. 5A).
Analyses of apoptotic enzymes demonstrate that
after treatment with multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded
liposomes, a cascade of apoptotic reactions happens via
caspase-related signaling pathways (Fig. 5B). Apoptotic
proteins (Fas, Fasl, Bax, Bok, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and P53)
in GSCs after treatments with varying formulations are
measured, and results further elucidate that the apoptotic
receptor/ligand (Fas/Fasl), pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax,
Bok), anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1) and tumor
suppressor protein (P53) are involved in the apoptotic
process of GSCs. Consequently, this study suggests
that there are the two ways in which GSCs die: killing
by cytotoxic agents or inducing to commit suicide, i.e.,
apoptosis, by multifunctional targeting drug-loaded
liposomes [25]. Since GSCs are resistant to the substrate
of cytotoxic agents such as daunorubicin, inducing
apoptosis can be an effective approach to eradicate the
quiescent subsets in cancer populations.
Accordingly, the enhanced inhibitory effects to
GSCs after treatment with multifunctional targeting drugsloaded liposomes could be explained by the following
facts: the activated Fas receptor (Fas) forms the deathinducing signaling complex (DISC) by binding with the
ligand (Fasl), and the DISC is internalized via the cellular
endosomal machinery [26]. This allows Fas-associated
death domain (FADD) to bind the death domain (DD),
and then caspase 8 (FADD-like) self-activate through
proteolytic cleavage. The activated up-stream initiator
caspase 8 catalyzes the cleavage of pro-apoptotic proteins
(Bok and Bax) or inhibits activities of anti-apoptotic
proteins (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), hence resulting in translocation
of the outer mitochondrial membrane and further cleavage
of caspase 9. In case of activating the apoptotic enzymes
(caspase 8 and 9), they will result in a cascade of apoptotic
reactions, followed by activating the down-stream effector
(caspase 3). Meanwhile, the activated P53 up-regulates
the apoptotic receptor/ligand (Fas/Fasl), pro-apoptotic
proteins (Bax, Bok) and apoptotic enzymes (caspases 8,
9 and 3) but down-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2, Mcl-1). This eventually leads to DNA degradation,
membrane blebbing, and other hallmarks of apoptosis
[27].
The multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded
liposomes also show a strong penetrating ability
into GSCs spheroids and a destructing effect to the
spheroids. By viewing confocal images at different
layers of the spheroids from top to middle, the strongest
fluorescent intensity can be observed after treatment
with multifunctional targeting coumarin liposomes (Fig.
6A). Fluorescence overlay of different layers in GSCs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

spheroids also indicates that the multifunctional targeting
liposomes have a strong penetrating ability. Furthermore,
multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes display the most significant destructing effects
to tumor spheroids compared with other formulations (Fig.
6B). The tightly organized spheroids after treatment with
multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes become disintegrated and shrunken. Besides,
a strong destructing effect happens as well after treatment
with free daunorubicin plus quinacrine due to the direct
exposure of free drugs.
As for evaluating the in vivo anticancer efficacy,
brain glioma-bearing mice are made by inoculating
GSCs. The survival effects demonstrate that the
multifunctional targeting drugs-loaded liposomes have
a strong potential in treating the brain glioma-bearing
mice (Fig. 7A). The evident anticancer efficacy in treating
brain glioma in mice is explained by the following
aspects: (i) PEG chain of DSPE-PEG2000 can avoid the
rapid uptake by reticuloendothelial system (RES) and
increase accumulation in tumor sites by EPR effect;
(ii) WGA conjugated on the multifunctional targeting
liposomal surface can enhance the transport of drugsloaded liposomes across the BBB and the cellular uptake
by GSCs; (iii) TAM inserted into the liposomal bilayer
can enhance the transport of drugs across the BBB and
circumvent drug efflux of ABC transporters overexpressed
on the BBB and cellular membrane of GSCs; (iv)
incorporated quinacrine can induce apoptosis of glioma
cells and GSCs.
For understanding the distribution status of
multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes in vivo, real-time imaging is performed in
brain glioma-bearing mice. The near-infrared fluorescent
probe DiR is encapsulated into the targeting liposomes
for indicating the distribution. The imaging results in
vivo demonstrate that the multifunctional targeting
DiR liposomes have a long-lasting stability in blood
circulation, and exhibit a significant accumulation in
tumor masses (Fig. 7C). The ex vivo fluorescent images
of tumor masses and major organs further confirm above
distributions of the multifunctional targeting liposomes
(Fig. 7B).
The specificity of the multifunctional targeting
liposomes to glioma tissues is evidenced in tumor-bearing
mice with a confocal method (Fig. 7D). Results show
that the multifunctional targeting coumarin liposomes
exhibit the strongest green fluorescence among varying
formulations. This phenomenon is associated with
the enhanced transport drugs across the BBB and the
increased cellular uptake in both glioma cells and GSCs
by WGA and TAM. The confocal results of specificity to
tumor masses are consistent with those observed by in vivo
real-time image.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Characterization of the liposomes
Particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta
potential values were measured using a Nano Series
Zen 4003 Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern,
UK). Morphology of the liposomes was observed by
AFM (SPI3800N series SPA-400, NSK Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). The drugs-loaded liposomes were separated from
un-encapsulated drugs by passing the liposomes over a
Sephadex G-50 column eluted with 20 folds HBS buffer
(v/v). Daunorubicin, quinacrine and TAM were measured
by HPLC (Agilent Technologies Inc., Cotati, CA,
USA), respectively. Encapsulation efficiencies (EE) of
daunorubicin, quinacrine and TAM were calculated using
the formula: EE = (Wencap / Wtotal) ×100%, where Wtotal and
Wencap were the measured amounts of drugs in the liposome
suspensions before and after passing over the Sephadex
G-50 column, respectively [31]. WGA was measured by
the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Corporation, Beijing
local agent, China). WGA coupling rate was calculated
by the ratio of the WGA amount on the liposomes after
separation to the added amount.
In vitro release of daunorubicin and quinacrine in
drugs-loaded liposomes was performed by the dialysis
against the release medium (PBS containing 10% fetal
calf serum). Daunorubicin and quinacrine in the samples
were measured by HPLC as above, and release rates of
both drugs were estimated as our previous reports [32, 33].
Each assay was repeated in triplicate.
In order to quantify the amount of WGA molecules
present in one liposome particle, the density of one
liposome particle was assumed to be 1.2 g/cm3 according
to the reference [34] and the number of WGA per liposome
was calculated with the following equation:
NWGA= (Ntotal × MOLWGA%×NA)/(Mtotal /M)
Where NWGA represents the amount of WGA in one
liposome; Ntotal is the total mole number of lipid materials
in a sample; MOLWGA % is the mol % of WGA molecules
in the total lipid materials used; NA is Avogadro’s
constant; Mtotal is the total mass of liposomes in the same
sample; M is the average mass of one liposome calculated
with the measured average particle diameter and density
(1.2g/cm3).

Preparation of the liposomes
Blank multifunctional targeting liposomes were
prepared using the film dispersion method [28]. Briefly,
egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, polyethylene glycoldistearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE-PEG2000, NOF
Corporation, Japan), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-PEG2000DSPE (DSPE-PEG2000-NHS, NOF Corporation, Japan)
and TAM (Nanjing Tianzun Zezhong Chemicals, Co.,
Ltd, Nanjing, China) (60: 40: 2.5: 1.25: 8, molar ratio)
were dissolved in chloroform in a pear-shaped flask.
The chloroform was evaporated by a rotary evaporator,
and the formed lipid film was hydrated with 250 mM
ammonium sulfate by sonication in a water bath for 5 min.
Subsequently, the suspensions were treated by a probetype sonicator for 10 min (200 W). The suspensions were
successively extruded through polycarbonate membranes
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) with the pore size of 400
nm and 200 nm for 3 times, respectively. Then, blank
liposomes were obtained. The blank liposomes were
further dialyzed (cut-off MW, 12,000-14,000) in the
Hepes buffered saline (25 mM Hepes/ 150 mM NaCl) for
24 h. After dialysis, a certain amount of WGA (Shanghai
BioSun Sci & Tech Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) (DSPEPEG2000-NHS: WGA = 30: 1, molar ratio) was added,
followed by 10 h incubation at room temperature, and
then a chromatographic separation (Sephadex G-100,
Beijing Biodee Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Beijing, China)
was performed to remove the unbound WGA. A volume of
5 mL liposome suspensions was mixed with the solution
of daunorubicin (Nanjing Tianzun Zezhong Chemicals,
Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China) and quinacrine (Sigma- Aldrich
Corporation Beijing local agent, China) (daunorubicin:
quinacrine = 1: 1, molar ratio; lipids: drug = 15: 1, w/w).
After mixing, the suspensions were incubated at 40 °C in
a water bath, and intermittently shaken for 20 min, thus
producing the multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus
quinacrine liposomes [29].
WGA-mediated targeting daunorubicin plus
quinacrine
liposomes, TAM-mediated
targeting
daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes and daunorubicin
plus quinacrine liposomes were prepared using the same
procedures as above, excluding the addition of TAM,
WGA or both. The multifunctional targeting coumarin
liposomes or coumarin liposomes (lipids: coumarin = 200:
1, w/w) and the multifunctional targeting DiR liposomes
or DiR liposomes (lipids: DiR = 300: 1, w/w) were
similarly prepared as the fluorescent probes [30].

Cell culture and identification of glioma stem cells
Glioma cells (Institute of Basic Medical Science,
Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China)
were maintained in Ham’s F10 medium (Macgene)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco). GSCs were grown in serum-free DMEM-F12
(Macgene) supplemented with 20 ng/mL basic FGF, 20
ng/mL EGF (Macgene) and 2% B27 (Gibco). GSCs were
identified with the following procedures [35]. Brieﬂy,

under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for three weeks were collected,
enzymatically dissociated and washed in PBS. The
samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.
After being penetrated with 0.2% Triton-X100, the cells
were incubated with monoclonal anti-mouse/rat nestinphycoerythrin or their appropriate isotype controls (R&D
Systems Inc, USA) for 30 min in the dark. The samples
were then washed 3 times and re-suspended in 500 µL
cold PBS. Then, they were performed on a FACScan ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA) [36].

BBB model was established as previously described
[39]. Briefly, murine brain microvascular endothelial
cells (BMVECs, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences,
China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China) were
maintained in the medium (DMEM, 20% FBS, 100 units/
mL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin, 2 mmol/L
l-glutamine, 100 µg/mL endothelial cell growth factor,
40 U/mL insulin). BMVECs were seeded into the gelatin
solution coated transwells (Corning, NY, USA; 0.4 μm
pore size, 12 mm diameter, and 1.12 cm2 surface area) at
a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/well, and were incubated at 37
°C for 6 days. Culture medium was changed every other
day. Prior to experiment, tightness of the BBB model was
evaluated by measuring TEER values. Once the TEER
values were higher than 250 Ω·cm2, the BBB model was
applied for the further experiments.
To evaluate the transport ratio of daunorubicin
across the BBB, varying drug formulations were
added in the transwells at a concentration of 50 μM
daunorubicin. After treatment, a volume of 500 μL sample
was taken from basal chamber at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 h.
The concentration of daunorubicin was measured using
HPLC as above, and transport ratio of daunorubicin was
estimated as our previous reports.
To understand the inhibitory effects to GSCs after
drug transport across the BBB, the BBB model was
formed in the inserts, and then transferred to another 12well culture plates where GSCs had been cultured for 24
h. Then, varying formulations were added to BBB models,
respectively. After incubation for 2 h, the inserts were
moved away, and GSCs were further incubated for 48 h.
The following procedures were the same with those used
in SRB assay.

Uptake and distribution in glioma and glioma
stem cells
Cellular uptakes of multifunctional targeting drugsloaded liposomes by glioma cells and by GSCs were semiquantified. Glioma cells and single cell suspensions of
GSCs were seeded into 6-well culture plates at a density
of 4 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h, and then the
cells were treated with varying drug formulations at a
concentration of 10 μM daunorubicin. Culture medium
was used as a blank control. After incubation for 3 h,
the cells were washed 3 times with PBS, trypsinized
and harvested in 300 μL PBS. Fluorescence intensity of
daunorubicin was analyzed by flow cytometry with 1 × 104
cells collected. The excitation wavelength of daunorubicin
was set at 488 nm and the emission wavelength was in the
range 560 - 590 nm. Each assay was repeated in triplicate.
To observe cellular distribution of multifunctional
targeting drugs-loaded liposomes, GSCs were seeded
into chambered coverslips at a density of 2×105 cells/dish
and incubated for 24 h. Then, varying drug formulations
were applied to the dishes at a concentration of 10 μM
daunorubicin and incubated for another 3 h. Control
group was performed with blank medium. The cells
were then washed 3 times with PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min and stained with Hochest
33258 (2 μg/mL) for 5 min. The samples were analyzed
using a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscopy
(Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) [37].

Regulating ABC transporters and apoptotic
proteins
To evaluate regulating effects of multifunctional
targeting drugs-loaded liposomes on the ABC transporters,
glioma cells and GSCs were cultured with serumcontaining medium for 24 h. Then, glioma cells were
treated with blank medium while GSCs were treated
with blank medium and with varying drug formulations
at a concentration of 10 μM daunorubicin or quinacrine.
The cells were further cultured for 12 h. ABC transporter
proteins were analyzed using the microplate reader
according to manufacturer instructions of the kits (Cusabio
Biotech, Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China).
The regulating effects of multifunctional targeting
drugs-loaded liposomes on the apoptotic proteins (Fas,
Fasl, caspase 8, caspase 9, caspase 3, Bax, Bok, Bcl-2,
Mcl-1, and P53) in GSCs were determined using ELISA
kits (Cusabio Biotech). Briefly, the cells were cultured for

Inhibiting glioma cells and glioma stem cells
Glioma cells and GSCs were seeded into 96-well
culture plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well and grown
in serum-containing culture medium for 24 h. Varying drug
formulations were added, respectively. The concentration
of daunorubicin or quinacrine (daunorubicin: quinacrine
= 1: 1, μM/μM) was in the 0 - 10 μM range. Culture
medium was used as a blank control. After treatment for
48 h, the cytotoxicity was performed by a sulforhodamine
B (SRB) staining assay [38]. Finally, dose-effect curves
were plotted according to the assay data. Each assay was
repeated in triplicate.

24 h, and then were treated with varying drug formulations
at a concentration of 10.0 μM daunorubicin, respectively.
Control experiments were performed by adding culture
medium. After incubation for 12 h, cells were harvested
and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by a microplate
reader according to manufacturer instructions of the kits.

daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes, WGA-mediated
targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes, and
multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes were administrated via tail vein at a dose of
5 mg/kg, respectively. Treatments were undergone every
other day for consecutive 4 times. The survivals of these
mice were observed and survival curves were made.

Penetrating ability and destructing effects in
glioma stem cell spheroids

In vivo imaging observation
To evaluate targeting effects in mice, multifunctional
targeting DiR liposomes were used as a fluorescent probe
[41]. Briefly, 18 male ICR mice were inoculated with
GSCs as above. After inoculated for 14 days, the mice
were randomly divided into six groups, and administered
saline, free DiR, DiR liposomes, TAM-mediated targeting
DiR liposomes, WGA-mediated targeting DiR liposomes
and multifunctional targeting DiR liposomes (1 μg DiR
each) via tail vein. Then, the mice were scanned at 1, 3,
6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 h using a Kodak multimodal imaging
system (Carestream Health, Inc., USA). After sacrificed at
48 h, major organs including hearts, livers, spleens, lungs,
kidneys and brains (containing tumor masses) of mice
were removed immediately. The fluorescence signals in
different organs were photographed.

After continuous cultured in serum-free medium for
3 weeks, GSCs spheroids were formed. To evaluate the
penetrating ability, coumarin was used as the fluorescent
probe. Briefly, GSCs spheroids were treated with free
coumarin, coumarin liposomes and multifunctional
targeting coumarin liposomes for 12 h, respectively.
The final concentration of coumarin was 10 μM. After
the spheroids were washed with PBS, the samples were
observed at the different layers from top to middle of
the spheroids using a confocal laser scanning fluorescent
microscope [40].
To evaluate the destructing effects of multifunctional
targeting drugs-loaded liposomes on the spheroids,
GSCs spheroids were collected into six-well culture
plates, and then treated with free daunorubicin plus
quinacrine, daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes and
multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes at a concentration of 10 μM daunorubicin
or quinacrine. Blank control was treated with culture
medium. After incubation for 48 h, the spheroids were
fixed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 60 min, washed 3 times
with cold PBS, dehydrated and embedded. The spheroids
were observed under a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, JSM-5600 LV, JEOL, Japan).

The specificity to glioma tissues
To evaluate the specificity of the multifunctional
targeting liposomes to glioma tissues, coumarin was used
as the fluorescent probe. Briefly, 6 mice were inoculated
with GSCs as above. After inoculated for 14 days, the
tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into six
groups, and administered with saline, free coumarin,
coumarin liposomes, TAM-mediated targeting coumarin
liposomes, WGA-mediated targeting coumarin liposomes
and multifunctional targeting coumarin liposomes (50
μg coumarin each) via tail vein, respectively. After
administration for 2 h, mice were sacrificed, and then
hearts were perfused with 20 mL PBS for removing
the blood in the brain. Brains were removed to make
cryosections at 10 mm per slice. The slices were stained
with Hochest 33258 (2 μg/mL) for 20 min in the dark and
then washed 3 times with cold PBS. The samples were
analyzed using a confocal laser scanning fluorescent
microscopy (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).

Anticancer efficacy in brain glioma-bearing mice
Imprinting control region (ICR) mice bearing
GSCs were prepared as reported previously [35]. All
procedures were performed according to guidelines of
the Institutional Authority for Laboratory Animal Care
of Peking University. Briefly, the mice (18-20 g, Peking
University Experimental Animal Center, Beijing, China)
were anesthetized (0.2 mL / 20 g) by 4% chloral hydrate
and incised through the skin to expose the cranium. The
coordinates of the implant target point was set at 1.0 mm
anterior from the coronal suture, 3.5 mm right-lateral
from the sagittal suture, and 3.0 mm in depth. A volume
of 3 μL GSCs (5 × 104 cells/μL) was implanted into
target point of each mouse using a stereotaxic instrument
(RWD Life Science Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China). At
day 10 post inoculation, the mice were randomly
divided into six groups (6 mice/group). Physiological

A kind of multifunctional targeting daunorubicin
plus quinacrine liposomes was developed by modifying
with TAM and WGA. The multifunctional targeting
daunorubicin plus quinacrine liposomes demonstrated
strong capabilities in crossing the BBB, in killing glioma
cells and GSCs in vitro and in glioma-bearing mice.
The action mechanisms for the enhanced efficacy in
treating brain glioma are due to the following aspects: (i)
evading the rapid elimination from blood circulation by
incorporating PEGylated lipid materials on the liposome
vesicles; (ii) crossing the BBB via the adsorptive
endocytosis mediated by WGA and via blocking the
efflux of drugs mediated by TAM; (iii) improving drug
uptake by glioma cells and GSCs via the receptormediated endocytosis by WGA and via blocking the
efflux of internalized drugs from GSCs by TAM; (iv)
down-regulating the overexpressed ABC transporters
(ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2) that mediated drug
resistance of GSCs; (v) inducing apoptosis of GSCs
via up-regulating apoptotic receptor/ligand (Fas and
Fasl), activating apoptotic enzymes (caspase 8, 9 and
3), activating pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bok),
activating tumor suppressor protein (P53) and suppressing
anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1). Consequently,
the multifunctional targeting daunorubicin plus quinacrine
liposomes offer a potential strategy for treating brain
glioma and GSCs.
