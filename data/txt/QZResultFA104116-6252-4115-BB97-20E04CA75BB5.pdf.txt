Fanconi anemia and the repair of Watson and Crick crosslinks

Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins function in maintaining genomic stability. Their major role is in the
repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, which by virtue of covalently binding the Watson and Crick
strands of DNA, impede replication and transcription. Inappropriately repaired interstrand
crosslinks cause genomic instability leading to cancer; conversely, their toxicity makes them a
powerful chemotherapeutic. Here, we discuss how FA proteins promote stem cell function,
prevent tumorigenesis, stabilize replication forks, and inhibit improper repair. We also review the
most recent advances identifying endogenous aldehydes as possible culprits in DNA damage that
induces the phenotypes seen in the FA patients.

Introduction
Fanconi anemia (FA) occurs in approximately one out of every 100,000 births 1. Biallelic
mutations in FA genes lead to bone marrow failure and susceptibility to both acute myeloid
leukemia and solid tumors, as well as congenital abnormalities and infertility 2. The function
of the pathway, on the other hand, is anything but rarified: FA proteins participate in the
repair of extraordinarily deleterious lesions, interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), and in
maintaining genomic stability during DNA replication.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

FA is genetically heterogeneous. To date, fifteen genes have been identified as mutated in
patients (Figure 1, Table 1), many more interacting genes have been discovered, and there
are still patients in which a mutation is yet to be identified. The known genes work together
in ICL repair, coordinating the actions of multiple repair processes, in particular nucleases
that are necessary for cutting the ICL out and for other nucleolytic processing necessary for
the repair, translesion synthesis (TLS), a mode of damage tolerance that uses specialized
polymerases to insert a base across from a lesion or abasic site, and homologous
recombination (HR), the pathway best known for its role in repairing double-stranded
breaks. The FA proteins may also counteract some of the activities of the non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ) pathway, an error-prone repair pathway that is used to directly re-ligate
DNA ends. Overall, FA interacts with many of the currently described genome maintenance
pathways; as such, studying it provides a unique window into the elaborate interplay of
multiple cellular networks.
FA is also intimately involved with an expanding list of biological processes as new
functions come to light (Figure 2). The bone marrow failure seen in patients suggests a
function in stem cell biology, and indeed, recent work has begun to uncover tantalizing
insights not only into FA pathogenesis, but also the intersection between DNA repair and
stem cell maintenance. Several members of the FA pathway are also canonical breast and
ovarian cancer predisposition genes, which together with the cancer susceptibility in FA

patients points to an important role for FA proteins in suppressing tumorigenesis. Recent
work has described an unanticipated role for FA proteins in replication fork stabilization.
Finally, the identification of aldehydes as an endogenous genotoxin in FA provides an
exciting glimpse into what challenges in the cellular environment are important in human
disease. In this review, we highlight these topics and also give a primer on the current
understanding of the molecular details of the FA pathway.

Stem cell function in the absence of the FA pathway
One of the clinical identifiers of FA is bone marrow failure which can be rescued by bone
marrow transplantation, suggesting that disrupting the pathway leads to dysfunction of the
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) themselves. While the bulk of FA research
so far concentrates on the DNA repair functions of the pathway in terminally differentiated
cells, this clinical manifestation points to a critical role in stem cell development that must
be explored. A clear connection between the cellular and disease phenotypes in FA has been
elusive, due to the difficulty in establishing mouse models that parallel human disease and
because the limited proliferative potential of primary hematopoietic cells makes patientderived in vitro systems infeasible. Understanding the interactions between FA pathway
function and stem cell regulation and maintenance will likely prove to be key to elucidating
the functional link between the pathway and the disease.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recent research provides a glimpse into such a functional link between defects in genome
maintenance and bone marrow failure in FA. Levels of p53, one of the central guardians of
genome maintenance, and its transcriptional target p21, are elevated in primary blood, bone
marrow, and even in the fetal FA livers during hematopoietic stem cell expansion in that
organ. Perhaps due to this hyperactivation, the pool of available HSPCs is already
compromised at birth in the FA individuals and the FA bone marrow is less proliferative
than healthy bone marrow, with more cells in G0/G1 cell cycle stages and an increase in
DNA damage signaling as indicated by the presence of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX).
Not only are there fewer HSPCs in FA bone marrow, but those stem cells are also unable to
produce progenitors in vitro 3.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Disrupting the FA pathway is itself sufficient to impair hematopoietic development in vitro.
shRNA knockdown of either FANCA or FANCD2 in human embryonic stem cells leads to
significantly reduced production of hematopoietic progenitor cells and their differentiated
daughter populations 4. Exposing progenitor cells to crosslinking agents exacerbates the
proliferation deficiency. These findings link the canonical ICL repair function of the FA
pathway to its role in stem cell development. In murine hematopoetic stem cells and human
bone marrow stromal cells, FA deficiency leads to an increase in binucleated cells,
suggesting that cytokinesis failure also may contribute to bone marrow failure 5.
An important role for the FA pathway in stem cell function was uncovered when researchers
attempted to derive induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from FA fibroblasts. They
discovered that FA pathway deficient fibroblasts are refractory to reprogramming 6,7. It has
been proposed, although not shown, that the FA proteins participate directly in
reprogramming; alternatively, the increase in DNA damage signaling present in FA cells
may preclude the normal cell cycle progression (division) necessary for reprogramming. It is
also possible that the FA pathway is required to repair DNA damage that reprogramming
itself induces. Discriminating between these possibilities will be key to understanding the
role of the FA pathway in stem cells.
Taken together, recent data point to a connection between DNA repair defects and HSPC
failure, though many mysteries remain. It is intriguing, for example, that FA deficiency
leads to problems with both quiescent HSCs and their rapidly-dividing progenitors, two very

different cellular landscapes. Understanding the underlying molecular functions of FA in
hematopoietic stem cell populations will open up new avenues into understanding the
pathophysiology of the disease. Furthermore, teasing out the importance of a pathway
traditionally associated with DNA repair to the normal function of an important stem cell
population will provide novel insight into stem cell biology in general.

FA pathway and tumor suppression
FA has a complicated relationship to tumorigenesis. While susceptibility to cancer,
particularly AML and squamous cell carcinomas, is endemic to patients with homozygous
mutations in the FA genes, four out of five downstream members of the pathway, which
function in homology-directed repair of DNA ends, also confer susceptibility to breast
cancer and ovarian cancer when mutated in only one copy 8–14 (Table 1). The famous breast
cancer predisposition gene BRCA2 is itself an FA gene, FANCD1 15, and its partner PALB2
is FANCN 16. FANCJ is BRCA1-associated BRIP1 17,18 and RAD51C, one of the RAD51
paralogs important for HR, is provisionally named FANCO 19. In FA, patients with
mutations in downstream pathway members evince more severe phenotypes, with more
prevalent and earlier onset of tumors and leukemia. FANCD1 and FANCN patients also
present with embryonal tumors at an extremely early age (< 2 years old).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The cancers that develop in FA patients also point to the complex landscape that is required
for tumorigenesis to progress. Predisposition to AML may derive from the same
hematopoietic stem cell instability that contributes to bone marrow failure. The type of
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck common to FA are also associated with
human papilloma virus (HPV), raising the possibility that these tumors develop in the
context of infection with an oncogenic virus.
The correlation between downstream FA members and cancer is intuitive when one
considers the mechanics of the pathway: while the upstream members belonging to the core
and ID complexes are more self-contained, functioning in pathway activation and early
coordination steps, the downstream components are intimately associated with homology
directed repair (HR) which is used more broadly outside and independently of the FA
pathway.

Basic functions of FA in ICL repair

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since crosslinked DNA impedes both transcription and replication, ICLs need to be removed
during all stages of the cell cycle. Indeed, there is evidence for both replication-dependent
and independent repair. In the absence of damage sensing by active replication forks and a
homologous template, repair depends upon nucleotide excision repair, especially
transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, and translesion synthesis proteins,
including polymerase kappa 20,21. The involvement of Fanconi and Fanconi-associated
proteins in G1 repair remains to be elucidated, although the core complex components and
the ID complex are able to bind to ICLs independently of replication and their absence
results in inefficient repair 22.
During S phase, the replication fork encounters the lesion and is forced to stall, activating a
cascade of events leading to initiation of the DNA damage response. Current models favor a
structure in which two replication forks converge upon a single lesion, which is most likely
to occur in late S phase 23, although it is likely that a replication fork approaching the lesion
from only one side would also elicit repair. Replication fork stalling at the site of damage is
followed by an unhooking step, in which incisions are made on either side of the covalently
linked nucleotides (Figure 1). On the strand that is incised, TLS, is recruited to bypass the
unhooked crosslink. The incision event also effectively creates a double-stranded break,

which is repaired by HR 23–25. The multi-step nature of ICL repair requires the tight
coordination of several different repair pathways, and it is within this delicately balanced
system that the FA pathway plays its regulatory role.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An important step in the FA pathway is the monoubiquitylation of two components, FANCI
and FANCD2, which form a heterodimer called the ID complex. Monoubiquitiylation of
FANCD2 at lysine 561, and to a lesser extent of FANCI at lysine 523, represents the
activation step of the FA pathway 26,27. This step is dependent on the FA core complex,
which is comprised of FANCA, B, C, E, F, G, L, and M, and accessory proteins including
FAAP20, FAAP24 and FAAP100. With the exception of FANCM, each core complex
member is absolutely required for successful monoubiquitylation of FANCD2-FANCI. The
ubiquitin ligase function of the core complex depends upon the E3 ligase FANCL, with
UBE2T lending its services as an E2 28–30. Ubiquitylation of FANCI and FANCD2 are
mutually interdependent in mammalian cells, and also require discrete phosphorylation
events: phosphorylation of FANCI at SQ/TQ sites close to the targeted lysine is necessary
for specific ubiquitylation of the ID complex 31. Recent evidence that FANCD2
ubiquitylation is robustly stimulated by the presence of DNA suggests that this event may
occur on chromatin 32. Ubiquitylated ID complex localized to chromatin orchestrates the
actions of downstream repair proteins. Interestingly, the ID complex may also play a direct
role in the regulation of nucleosome assembly at sites of damage: turnover of histone H3
after crosslinker treatment is markedly slowed after FANCD2 knockdown 33.
The downstream components, those that are dispensable for monoubiquitylation of the ID
complex are FANCD1, FANCJ, FANCN, and FANCO - already introduced above as cancer
predisposition genes necessary for homologous recombination - and FANCP (SLX4), which
interacts with multiple nucleases, discussed in greater detail below. FANCD1 and FANCN
have been shown to work in later stages of repair where they complete repair through HR.
FANCJ largely remains a mystery and its role as an FA protein needs to be explored further.
Although the details of how the pathway is turned off are not fully elucidated, one player
that clearly participates in the process is the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1, which removes
the ubiquitin from FANCD2 34. In its absence, ubiquitinated FANCD2 is elevated but the
cells are sensitive to crosslink damage 35,36. As such, it is clear that both appropriate
activation and deactivation of the pathway are important for cell viability when challenged
with ICL damage.

The FA Pathway Coordinates Nuclease Action
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A key step in most repair pathways involves the physical removal of the damaged bases as
well as processing of DNA by nucleases. In the case of ICLs, the lesion affects both Watson
and Crick strands, and its repair requires the collaboration of several processing enzymes.
Each incision event requires a nuclease with the correct structure specificity in order to yield
a repair intermediate that can correctly feed into the subsequent step. For example, crosslink
unhooking must precede the resection steps necessary to provide a substrate for HR.
Therefore, the removal steps are a complex choreography of nuclease action. The FA
pathway has been implicated in the recruitment and regulation of several different nucleases,
among them XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, SLX1, and FAN1 37–42.
FANCP, or SLX4, is a recently identified FA protein that functions as a scaffold, modulator,
and cofactor for three structure specific nucleases: XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, and
SLX1 43–46. Essentially modular in nature, FANCP is unique in that it can bring a veritable
toolbelt of DNA processing enzymes to the site of DNA damage, ensuring the presence of
the best repair nuclease for the job. Among the three nucleases associated with SLX4, XPFERCC1 is the most important for the resistance to ICLs, with MUS81-EME1 and SLX1

playing less prominent roles 47,48. The exonuclease SNM1A is also biochemically active at
sites of crosslinks. It is required for ICL resistance, consistent with an in vivo function in
repair of these lesions. Although its exact interaction with the FA proteins remains largely
unclear, it is thought to act in concert with SLX4-associated XPF-ERCC1 to process the
crosslink after the initial incision 49. In vitro, SNM1A can digest ICL-containing DNA past
the lesion, creating a preferred substrate for downstream TLS polymerases 49.
Understanding precisely how SNM1A, as well as other nucleases, are coordinated and
controlled by, or independent of, the FA proteins will be critical to understanding this
multifaceted repair pathway.
FAN1, the Fanconi associated nuclease, was identified by multiple groups to be required for
ICL resistance 38–41 implicating it in ICL repair. FAN1 can be recruited to the sites of DNA
damage in a manner dependent upon the ubiquitylated ID complex and upon its own
ubiquitin-binding domain. The precise mechanism of FAN1’s action upon crosslinked DNA
remains elusive; however, it is clear that FAN1 participates in a separate, as-yet
uncharacterized branch of crosslink repair in addition to the FA pathway.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This function of FAN1 was recently illuminated by studying another rare genetic disease
called karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN), which is characterized clinically by
progressive renal failure and histologically by enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei within
the kidney tubular epithelium. A cohort of patients with KIN were seen to have mutations in
FAN1. Interestingly, patients with KIN have no hallmarks of FA but cells from these
patients exhibit significant sensitivity to crosslinking agents, which can be complemented
with wild type FAN1, suggesting that an ICL repair defect conferred by FAN1 deficiency
does, at least in part, underlie the syndrome 50. FAN1’s deficiency resulting in KIN and not
FA, despite the fact that FAN1 and FANCD2 physically interact, suggests that FAN1 might
be redundant with another nuclease in the FA pathway. It also implies that FAN1 has a
function that is independent of the FA pathway in the kidney, where it may repair lesions
that the FA pathway cannot. It is of interest that FAN1 expression is very high in the kidney.
The deviance between KIN and FA phenotypes is a fascinating puzzle that might be a key to
understanding different modes of ICL repair as well as a clue to the endogenous lesions that
give rise to disease not only in these rare patients but also during normal aging.

FA pathway and replication stress

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to an indispensable role at DNA crosslinks, the FA pathway is required for the
protection of replication fork stability under stress. The ID complex is monoubiquitylated
during S phase even in unchallenged cells 15. The pathway is also activated by depletion of
nucleotide pools with hydroxyurea (HU), and even by UV light 51. This has been puzzling
since FA patient cell lines are not sensitive to either of these agents. However, recent data
suggests that FANCA, ubiquitylated FANCD2, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are necessary for the
protection of the stalled replication fork after HU treatment. When they are functionally
absent, RAD51 is not deposited onto the fork under stress and the newly synthesized
(nascent) DNA gets degraded in an MRE11-dependent manner 52,53. The outcome appears
to be an increase in chromosomal instability, which, while not directly leading to immediate
cellular demise, can still be mutagenic in the long term, thus contributing to the increase in
tumorigenesis seen in FA patients. Importantly, the protective function of the FA/BRCA
axis uncovered by these experiments appears to be separate from the canonical function of
BRCA2 in HR. It will be important to address if any of the ICL sensitivity of FA cell lines
might be secondary to a defect in fork protection function and whether the stem cell failure
in FA can be mitigated by fork stabilization.

Cooperation with other DNA repair pathways
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At its heart, FA pathway-mediated repair of ICLs is a highly regulated ensemble of other
repair pathways: a nuclease borrowed from canonical NER makes incisions, translesion
synthesis polymerases are responsible for filling in the gap across from the unhooked
crosslink, and HR is coopted to resolve the double-stranded breaks that result when
replication forks encounter the lesion. It is becoming clear that in addition to using other
pathways for discrete repair steps, the FA pathway is intimately entwined with the DNA
damage response as a whole, engaging in collaboration and antagonism with almost all of
the classical repair pathways in the fight for survival after genotoxic insult. The most notable
of these are the mismatch repair pathway components implicated in FANCJ 54 and
FANCD2 function 55, and the BLM helicase, which appears to intersect with the FA
pathway at multiple levels. BLM mutations are found in Bloom syndrome, an autosomal
recessive disease of growth retardation, immunodeficiency, sun sensitivity and profound
cancer predisposition. The BLM protein is responsible for unwinding a variety of DNA
structures and together with topoisomerase IIIα is able to remove the double Holliday
junctions (HJ) that form during HR 56. This process, called double HJ dissolution, prevents
the inappropriate engagement of nucleolytic HJ resolvases whose action may lead to
deleterious exchanges of DNA between sister chromatids.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There are two recently uncovered connections between FA and BLM. One pertains to
ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs), thread-like DNA structures that form between masses of
condensed DNA during anaphase, and are thought to arise from persistent, unresolved DNA
catenanes or recombination intermediates. Both BLM and the ID complex localize to these
microbridges, though FANCI and FANCD2 travel only to a subset of them, likely those
caused by replication stress at fragile sites 57. These microbridges may underlie the
cytokinesis failure in FA bone marrow cells discussed above. The second connection is with
FANCP/SLX4, which collaborates with BLM during Holliday junction resolution. Codepletion of these two proteins leads to a uniquely aberrant chromosome morphology, where
sister chromatids appear to stay linked and the chromosomes themselves adopt an odd
segmented appearance 58. As with many of the FA pathway’s apparent interactions with
other repair pathways, the underlying mechanisms and relationships must still be elaborated,
but taken together, the data reiterate how the players in the FA pathway have far-reaching
influence in general genome maintenance.

Fanconi anemia and non-homologous end joining

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The DNA repair pathway with a particularly fraught relationship with the FA pathway is
that of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is an error-prone mechanism for fixing
double-stranded breaks when no sister chromatid is available to be the template for HR, in
which DNA ends are ligated directly together without regard for homology. The Ku70-Ku80
heterodimer binds to DNA ends, where it recruits the catalytic subunit DNA-PK. LigIV is
then brought in to carry out the ligation (reviewed in 59).
NHEJ is the default double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in G0 and G1. In other
phases of the cell cycle, the cell faces a choice of whether to use NHEJ or HR to restore the
break. Recent work uncovers a dynamic shift between preferred pathways throughout the
cell cycle with HR reaching a peak during late S phase 60. The decision also hinges on
which factors access the free DNA end. The pattern of resection at the site of the doublestranded DNA break provides a particular substrate for each type of repair. HR requires
extensive resection to create a long 3′ overhang that, once coated with RAD51, can initiate
homology search, while NHEJ requires little resection if any. Competition between binding

Kottemann and Smogorzewska

Page 7

of HR and NHEJ factors influences the pattern, and only once the 3′ overhang has been
successfully resected is the cell fully committed to HR 61.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The FA pathway is thought to play a role in pathway choice, funneling the DSBs created by
ICL processing or other forms of replication stress into high-fidelity HR repair. There has
therefore been speculation that NHEJ-mediated repair in the absence of a functional FA
pathway is an underlying cause of the gross chromosomal abnormalities observed in FA cell
lines. Without a functional FA pathway, perhaps the breaks become subject to the profligate
end-pairing of NHEJ and thereby generate chromosomal rearrangements. Animal and
human cell models have been developed to test this hypothesis and so far are giving
contradictory findings (Table 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the basic components of the FA pathway are
conserved, including FANCD2 (FCD-2), FANCI (FNCI-1), FANCM (FCM-1) and FANCJ
(DOG-1) 62. The C. elegans ID complex is ubiquitinated and travels to sites of damage like
its human counterpart, and knockout of all four members leads to hypersensitivity to
crosslinking agents. The worm is an excellent model system to observe the effects of
knocking out NHEJ components in a FA-deficient background, as it mimics relevant
phenotypes with a pared-down pathway. When LIG-4, the DNA ligase important for NHEJ,
is mutated in the fcd-2 knockout, the sensitivity to crosslinking agents is corrected to nearwild type levels. These data suggest that NHEJ does in fact have a deleterious effect when
the FA pathway is deficient 63.
The C. elegans model is also useful for studying the interplay between FA and NHEJ during
meiosis. While FA patients and knockout mice exhibit fertility defects, the mechanisms
underlying this loss of fertility are poorly understood. The regulation and resolution of
meiotic crossovers derived from recombination of programmed double-stranded breaks is
mediated by many proteins that also serve in a DNA repair capacity, raising the possibility
that the FA pathway might also play a role. In the fcd-2 mutant, RAD51 foci persist during
meiosis, indicative of unresolved HR intermediates, and inappropriate nonhomologous
chromosome engagements are observed after diakinesis 63. Similar to what is seen in
somatic cells, the deletion of LIG-4 ameliorates the aberrant crossovers observed in the
fcd-2 mutant.
In chicken DT40 cells, the ICL hypersensitivity and chromosome breakage endemic to
FANCC cell lines can be suppressed by also knocking out Ku70 64. Interestingly, knocking
out either DNA-PK or LigIV in the DT40 cells effects no such rescue, in contrast to the
observations in C. elegans. In this case, the specificity of Ku rescue may point to a direct
role for FA proteins, possibly the ID complex, in antagonizing Ku attachment at DNA ends.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The implication that NHEJ underlies the hypersensitivity and chromosomal breakage
phenotypes in FA is of great clinical interest, as it provides a putative pharmaceutical target.
If the cellular phenotypes that underlie the disease are caused not by ICLs themselves but by
aberrant repair processes that occur in the absence of the FA pathway, perhaps NHEJ
inhibition could serve as a highly specific treatment. It is therefore critical to investigate the
relationship between these two pathways in mammalian cell lines. RNAi knockdown of
Ku80 in FANCC and FANCD2-deficient patient cell lines partially suppresses sensitivity to
the killing effects of crosslinking agents. Furthermore, the addition of a DNA-PK inhibitor
mitigates the hypersensitivity resulting from knockdown of FANCA or FANCD2 by RNAi
in HeLa cells, or by knockout of FancA or FancC in mouse embryonic fibroblasts 63. This
again is in contrast to genetic experiments that show that the crosslink sensitivity of the
Fancd2 knockout is not changed in the setting of decreased DNA-PK activity (Prkdc sc/sc

mouse)65 and that loss of 53BP1 or Ku80 renders Fancd2-deficient cells even more sensitive
to DNA crosslinking agents than Fancd2 deficiency alone66.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The inconsistencies between these studies raise questions about how to parse data from
different organisms, genetic backgrounds, and experimental setups. As hinted by these
experiments, different components of the NHEJ pathway may play different roles in
different organisms and even in different cells of the same organism; indeed, fibroblasts may
not accurately reflect how cells more relevant to FA, like HSPCs, might behave.
Furthermore, interaction between components of the two pathways may be exquisitely
sensitive to the spatial and temporal relationships between them. When thinking about
possible therapeutic implications of these findings, it is important to remember that the full
inhibition of the Ku proteins is not feasible in human cells since they have essential function
at human telomeres 67. Overall, well-controlled work, especially in human hematopoietic
cells, will be required to figure out the interplay of FA and NHEJ pathways. It will also be
necessary to determine how these extremely toxic ICLs are repaired if both FA and NHEJ
are compromised.

Alcohol metabolism poses a challenge for FA-deficient organisms

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The average human is not exposed to the clastogenic agents used in the lab to model DNA
repair defects. The FA pathway is required for dealing with replication stresses that can arise
during unchallenged cell cycle progression, as shown by the activation of the pathway
during normal S-phase. It is likely that the pathway also evolved in order to maintain
genome integrity in the face of mutagenic agents that arise endogenously from processes of
cellular metabolism. Oxidative stress within the cell can yield nucleophilic crosslinking
agents like malondialdehyde and acrolein, which derive from lipid peroxidation; nitric
oxide, another endogenous genotoxin that can promote the formation of crosslinks, is
generated independently of lipids 68. Aldehydes, discussed in greater detail below, are also a
major source of endogenous crosslink damage. Understanding how damage from these
endogenous agents feeds into the FA pathway is critical to understanding the disease.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ethanol metabolism has long been known to produce reactive aldehydes that can function as
carcinogens: acetaldehyde, an intermediate in the metabolic processing of ethanol, is in
particular implicated as a genotoxic agent. Acetaldehyde, which is generated from alcohol
metabolism, was shown to stimulate monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 in vitro, and FA cells
demonstrated sensitivity to formaldehyde 69,70. Until recently, though, no in vivo studies
functionally linked these cellular byproducts to concrete phenotypes in an FA model. The
first indication that such cellular byproducts may indeed pose a challenge to FA-deficient
systems comes from a genetic interaction between FA genes and superoxide dismutase
(SOD), an enzyme which decreases the load of oxidative damage in the cell as a whole.
Fancc−/−;Sod−/− mice display bone marrow hypocellularity, which is not present in either
of the single mutants 71. Studies investigating the effects of interfering with acetaldehyde
catabolism has uncovered a strong connection to the FA pathway. Chicken DT40 cells
knocked out for several FA components, including FANCB, FANCC, FANCL, and FANCJ,
are sensitive to treatment with acetaldehyde 72. In addition, FA DT40 knockouts are
synthetic lethal with mutations in the formaldehyde catabolism gene ADH5, suggesting that
toxicity is generated when the cells permit natural toxic aldehydes to build up 73.
A double mutant for FANCD2 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), an important
enzyme in acetaldehyde catabolism, was created to test the relevance of acetaldehyde
sensitivity in the developing mouse. The double mutant did not survive, with embryos dying
between embryonic day 9.5 and 13.5, if and only if the mother was homozygous for the
ALDH2 mutation. In contrast, pregnant females with one wild-type ALDH2 allele could

carry pups to term. When heterozygous mothers were fed ethanol during pregnancy, the
double mutant pups exhibited drastic developmental abnormalities, such as exencephaly and
eye defects 72. These data suggest that the developing mouse is exquisitely sensitive to toxic
aldehydes, casting light onto the significance of aldehyde catabolism in FA deficient
backgrounds.
A more important question is whether toxic aldehydes can produce symptoms in the mouse
that mimic the human disease phenotype. Chronic alcohol abuse is correlated with bone
marrow problems, reminiscent of the bone marrow failure observed in FA. Indeed, Fancd2−/
−;Aldh2−/− double mutants mice displayed increased levels of ethanol-induced bone
marrow failure compared to wild-type or single mutants. Even without administration of
ethanol, the double mutants die early, due to abnormalities that closely resemble acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.
Most tellingly, the double mutant mice that do not suffer from leukemia develop aplastic
anemia that is similar to that seen in human FA patients. The bone marrow failure in these
mice can be traced back to a DNA repair deficiency in the HSPC pool, suggesting that
endogenous aldehyde may be particularly harmful to hematopoetic stem cells, and providing
the first direct link between acetaldehyde related toxicity and bone marrow failure
phenotypes in FA 74.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Animal (particularly mouse) models of FA allow us to explore what genetic and
environmental factors contribute to disease pathogenesis, and as such can lead to better
disease management and treatment plans. Especially as sequencing becomes more
affordable, understanding what genetic factors modify and shape the progress of FA
symptoms will offer better diagnostics and tailored treatment. Discovering what commonly
encountered genotoxic agents contribute to the clinical manifestations of FA will provide
therapeutic targets and lifestyle modifications, not only for FA but for many diseases that
derive from DNA repair defects.

Looking Forward

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a multi-functional, highly connected pathway, the FA pathway is well poised to be a very
important topic in DNA repair and in biology. There is evidence of functional relationships
between the FA pathway and virtually all of the cellular DNA repair pathways, although
many of the details remain murky. Understanding the mechanisms behind these connections
will foster understanding of DNA repair as a whole, rather than a grab-bag of disparate
pathways. The genetic link between FA and breast cancer will also be an important topic as
research progresses, shedding light onto the nature of tumor suppressors, and the enigma of
genotype-phenotype correlations. As technologies make it easier to manipulate stem cells,
the function of FA in hematopoietic lineages and other stem cells will become a growing
subfield within FA research. We may finally gain insight into the developmental
abnormalities that are seen in patients. Combining studies of FA function and stem cell
development will allow us to create a powerful model of DNA repair within stem and
progenitor cell populations. Another pressing issue is the identification of the endogenous
damage that the FA pathway responds to. It is likely that the lesions arise from multiple
sources and that there will be nuances to how the FA pathway is responding to each of them.
Finally, there are many details about the molecular mechanism of ICL repair that are still
missing. Coordination and regulation of the nucleases identified as necessary for repair is a
topic of intense interest. With the identification of new players in the pathway we can only
expect that the pathway will become more complex but also more revealing. Deciphering
the mechanics of FA pathway function will help efforts to understand both a fascinating
disease, and basic human biology.

Figure 1. The FA pathway functions in ICL repair

Upon detection of the crosslink, the core complex is activated and FANCL in the complex
ubiquitylates the ID complex. The ID complex then coordinates the action of downstream
repair factors, including nucleases and homologous recombination proteins, like the FA
proteins BRCA2, FANCJ, PALB2, and RAD51C. Proteins that have been identified as
mutated in FA patients are shown in color; factors known to participate in the pathway but
are not clinically associated with FA are shown in grey. FANCJ, although not necessary for
FANCD2 monoubiquitylation, may work at earlier steps than homologous recombination.

Figure 2. The diverse functions of the Fanconi anemia pathway

The Fanconi pathway has many roles in human biology: as a regulator of the maintenance
and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, a tumor suppressor pathway, a
preserver of replication fork stability during S phase, and a barrier against unwanted
mutagenic repair processes. Besides the hematopoietic cells, other stem cells are most likely
being affected by lack of FA pathway leading to stochastic developmental abnormalities and
the infertility in FA individuals.

1

As yet, no cancers have been reported in patients with FANCL or FANCM mutations, possibly due to their extreme rarity.

2

FANCC carriers show increased risk of breast cancer 75

3

In patients with FANCD1 and FANCN mutations, the growth, bone marrow, and developmental phenotypes are as in other FA complementation
groups but the probability of malignancy is higher, the spectrum is different, and age of onset is lower, indicative of a more extreme subtype of FA.

4

FANCO is a provisional term, as patients with RAD51C mutations do not thus far display bone marrow failure or cancer, and chromosomal
breakage is not as high as seen in FA individuals.
