Abstract
The "Warburg effect" describes a peculiar metabolic feature
of many solid tumors, namely their increased glucose uptake
and high glycolytic rates, which allow cancer cells to accumulate building blocks for the biosynthesis of macromolecules.
During aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate is preferentially metabolized to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A
(LDH-A), suggesting a possible vulnerability at this target for
small-molecule inhibition in cancer cells. In this study, we used
FX11, a small-molecule inhibitor of LDH-A, to investigate this
possible vulnerability in a panel of 15 patient-derived mouse
xenograft (PDX) models of pancreatic cancer. Unexpectedly,
the p53 status of the PDX tumor determined the response to
FX11. Tumors harboring wild-type (WT) TP53 were resistant to
FX11. In contrast, tumors harboring mutant TP53 exhibited
increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation indices, and atten-

uated tumor growth when exposed to FX11. [18F]-FDG PET-CT
scans revealed a relative increase in glucose uptake in mutant
TP53 versus WT TP53 tumors, with FX11 administration downregulating metabolic activity only in mutant TP53 tumors.
Through a noninvasive quantitative assessment of lactate production, as determined by 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized pyruvate, we conﬁrmed that
FX11 administration inhibited pyruvate-to-lactate conversion
only in mutant TP53 tumors, a feature associated with reduced
expression of the TP53 target gene TIGAR, which is known to
regulate glycolysis. Taken together, our ﬁndings highlight p53
status in pancreatic cancer as a biomarker to predict sensitivity
to LDH-A inhibition, with regard to both real-time noninvasive
imaging by 13C MRS as well as therapeutic response. Cancer Res;

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth most
common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States,
with an alarming rise in incidence and a projection that it will
become the second most common cause of cancer deaths by
2030 (1). The 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced
PDAC is <5%, which remained largely unchanged over the last
four decades. The current treatment options for advanced
PDAC include the multidrug regimen FOLFIRINOX, or the
combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (2). However,
neither therapy is curative, providing a median survival of 11
and 8.5 months, respectively. The dismal prognosis of PDAC
patients underscores the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets that exploit the underlying mechanistic vulnerabilities in cancer cells.
Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer (3). A critical aberration in metabolism that
occurs in cancer cells is reﬂected in altered glucose metabolism.
In normal tissues, lactate generation through glycolysis, and the
resulting inefﬁcient ATP production, is limited to anaerobic
conditions, while pyruvate typically feeds into mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) when adequate oxygen
levels are present. In contrast, cancer cells preferentially convert
glucose into lactate through glycolysis, even under normal
oxygen concentrations, a phenomenon termed "aerobic
glycolysis" or the Warburg effect (4, 5). The enzyme lactate

dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) is involved in the conversion of
pyruvate into lactate, utilizing NADH as a cofactor. By converting pyruvate to lactate, LDH-A regenerates the NADþ needed to maintain glycolysis and diverts pyruvate from being
converted to acetyl-CoA for oxidative phosphorylation (6).
Aerobic glycolysis provides bioenergetic intermediates and
generates ATP, while simultaneously suppressing excessive
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The lactate produced
by cancer cells acidiﬁes the extracellular microenvironment,
promoting invasion and metastases, reduced drug efﬁcacy
through ion tapping, and evading immune recognition (7–
9). The increase in glycolytic ﬂux is a metabolic strategy of
tumor cells to ensure survival and growth in nutrient-deprived
environments (10).
LDH-A is upregulated by various oncogenic transcription
factors, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a) and cMyc, in cancers (11). Conversely, it has been documented
that reduction of fermentative glycolysis through LDH-A
blockade results in the inhibition of tumor growth and
metastases in various preclinical models, implicating LDHA as a viable therapeutic target (12–17). Blockade of LDH-A
activity with the pharmacologic inhibitor FX11 attenuates
tumor progression across various preclinical models, including in PDAC cell lines (18). Given the expanding portfolio of
pharmacologic inhibitors that target aberrant cancer metabolism (19, 20), it is imperative that molecular determinants of
sensitivity and resistance to these inhibitors be identiﬁed, and
further, clinically feasible assays that can provide insights into
in vivo response in real-time be developed. In this study, we
demonstrate that PDAC tumors are responsive to FX11 treatment in a TP53-dependent manner. We further demonstrate
that 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using hyperpolarized pyruvate provides a biochemically speciﬁc and clinically feasible approach for predicting in vivo response to LDH-A
inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Patient-derived PDAC xenografts
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) and the University
of South Florida (Tampa, FL). Male nu/nu athymic mice (Harlan)
were used for the study. Animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Fresh PDAC specimens resected from patients at the time of
surgery were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into the ﬂanks of
6-week-old mice, as previously described (21, 22). Grafted tumors
were subsequently transplanted from mouse to mouse and maintained as a live PDX Bank in Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore
as per the guidelines of Institutional Review Board-approved
protocol.
In vivo efﬁcacy of the LDH-A antagonist FX11 in patient-derived
PDAC xenografts
Fifteen individual patient-derived PDAC xenografts were used
for the study. The mutational status of common driver genes in
PDAC has been previously described for these PDXs (23). Brieﬂy,
subcutaneously established tumors were harvested at the exponential growth phase, and were cut aseptically into cubes of 1 to

2 mm3. The tumor pieces were dipped in Matrigel and implanted
on both ﬂanks of 6-week-old male nu/nu athymic mice (Harlan).
When cohorts of tumors reached approximately 200 mm3, mice
(5 mice/group; 8–10 tumors in each arm) were randomly
assigned to (i) control (vehicle) and (ii) FX11 (2.2 mg/kg),
injected intraperitoneally, once daily for 4 weeks. Tumors were
measured twice per week using a digital caliper, allowing discrimination of size modiﬁcations >0.1 mm. Individual tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula: tumor volume V ¼ a  b2/2,
where a being the largest dimension of the tumor, b the smallest.
Effect of FX11 treatment on tumor cell proliferation and
apoptosis
Excised tumors from the vehicle and FX11 treatment (harvested
from the 28 day efﬁcacy study) were ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin and processed into parafﬁn blocks. Sections were deparafﬁnized in xylene and rehydrated in graded-alcohol washes.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed using
standard procedure. The assessment of cellular proliferation was
conducted using an anti-MIB-1 (Ki-67) antibody (clone K2,
dilution 1:100, Ventana Medical Systems). IHC detection of
apoptosis was performed using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay with a
commercial apoptosis detection kit (DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL System; Promega), according to the recommendations
of the manufacturer. Stained sections were examined under light
microscope and images were captured. Histograms for TUNEL
and Ki-67 staining were generated by evaluating ﬁve high-power
ﬁelds (hpf) of tumor section from two independent tumors per
treatment arms (24).
TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator and
p53 IHC
Anti-TP53–induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR)
and anti-p53 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal to TIGAR, abcam,
ab37910 and rabbit polyclonal to p53, abcam, ab4060) were used
for TIGAR and p53 IHC, respectively. The staining was performed
as per manufacture's protocol. Brieﬂy, formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded sections were deparafﬁnized and subjected to heatmediated antigen retrieval in citrate buffer before blocking in 10%
serum for 1 hour at room temperature. The primary antibodies
were diluted at 1/400 (TIGAR) and 1/100 (p53). The sections
were incubated with the sample for 1 hour at room temperature
for TIGAR and 12 hours at 4 C for p53. A biotinylated goat antirabbit antibody was used as the secondary antibody (25, 26).
Stained sections were examined microscopically at 40 magniﬁcation and images were captured. The neoplastic areas were
examined for staining and were graded according to the prevalence of both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining within the tumor.
We used a 0 to 3 scale for staining intensity: 0, completely
negative; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining
(27). The staining was scored by evaluating sections from two
separate tumors each from P420, JH033, P286, JH024, P253,
P410, P194, and JH015.
Expression of human TIGAR transcripts in PDAC xenografts
Baseline TIGAR expression was determined in frozen tumors of
two xenografts each with TP53 wild-type (WT) and TP53-mutant
status. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen),
cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript First Strand System
(Invitrogen), and qRT-PCR for huTIGAR expression was

mice (N ¼ 5 each) from two PDX models - JH024 (TP53 WT)
and JH015 (TP53 mutant) were used for the study. Tumorbearing mice in JH024 and JH015 PDXs were treated with
vehicle or FX11 (2.2 mg/Kg) i.p. for 7 consecutive days. Mice
were imaged for determining the tumor glucose uptake by
[18F]-FDG-PET before the commencement of vehicle or FX11
treatment (D1) and on day 7 of vehicle or FX11 treatment
(D7). On the day of imaging, each mouse was injected with
250 mCi of [18F]-FDG via the tail vein and imaged 45 minutes
postinjection using the Mosaic HP (Philips) Small Animal PET
imagers with 15 minutes static acquisition. PET images were

conducted using FAST SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Human PGK1 and murine b-actin were used as
housekeeping genes. The primer sequences used for huTIGAR
are Forward 50 -ATGGAATTTTGGAGAGAA-30 Reverse 50 CCATGGCCCTCAGCTCAC-30 (28). Relative expression of the
mRNA was estimated using the 2DDCt method.

Pyruvate sample preparation and animal handling
Samples (30 mL) of [1-13C] pyruvic acid (Isotec) containing 15
mmol/L of OX63 trityl radical and 1.5 mmol/L of the gadolinium
chelate dotarem were polarized at 3.35T and 1.4K in the Hypersense DNP polarizer (Oxford Instruments) for one hour. The
hyperpolarized pyruvate sample was rapidly dissolved in 4 mL of
a superheated alkaline buffer comprising 100 mg/L ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid, 40 mmol/L of TRIS buffer, 40 mmol/L of NaOH,
and 30 mmol/L of NaCl. This produces 80 mmol/L concentration
of pyruvate with physiologic pH (7.4) for administration to
animals. Hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate solution of 350 mL was
intravenously injected over a period of 12 to 15 seconds through a
catheter placed in the jugular vein of the tumor-bearing mice.
Representative PDXs that were sensitive (JH015, P253) and
resistant (JH024, JH033) to FX11 treatment were chosen for the
hyperpolarized 13C-MRS study and T2-weighted MRI measurements. Mice with 500 mm3 subcutaneous tumors were selected
for the imaging study. The jugular vein catheter was surgically
implanted to facilitate polarized substrate injections. The mice
were treated with vehicle or FX11 (2.2 mg/kg) i.p. for 7 consecutive days (N ¼ 4 mice/group).

In vivo 13C MR spectroscopy
As preparation for the MRI experiment, mice were infused
with isoﬂuorane in a plastic anesthesia chamber with scavenging. Anesthetized mice were placed in a mouse-speciﬁc holder
within the MRI coil, outﬁtted with a mouse-speciﬁc nose cone
inhalant anesthesia and scavenging system for imaging. This
system also contains a pad for respiration monitoring, and
endo-rectal ﬁber optic temperature monitoring device, a heated
pad for maintaining core body temperature and leads for
electrocardiography (ECG monitoring). In vivo MR experiments
were performed on a 7T, 31-cm horizontal bore magnet (Agilent). Multi-slice T2-weighted anatomic images were acquired
using a respiratory-gated spin-echo sequence with a TE ¼ 60 ms,
TR ¼ 4000 ms, fat saturation, FOV 40  40 mm, echo train
length ¼ 8, matrix 256  128, slice thickness ¼ 1 mm, 15 slices.
Dynamic 13C MR spectra were acquired utilizing a dual tuned
1
H - 13C volume coil (M2M, 35 mm). All spectra were acquired
using slice-selective pulse with a nominal ﬂip angle of 9 , TR ¼
1 second, 30,000 complex points, and spectral width of 50 kHz.
In vivo data acquisition started right before the pyruvate injection and collected single transient spectra over a period of 150
seconds from a 5-mm-thick tumor slice. The peak heights of
pyruvate and lactate resonance spectra were used to calculate
relevant ratios (Lac/Pyr).

LDH-A Inhibition in Pancreatic Cancer

Results
Pharmacologic LDH-A inhibition leads to tumor growth
inhibition selectively in TP53-mutant PDAC xenografts
We sought to determine the treatment effect of FX11, a small
molecule that can inhibit LDH-A, in a panel of 15 pancreatic
cancer PDXs. A wide range of responses to 4 weeks of FX11
therapy was observed in these PDXs, with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) ranging from approximately 40% to a few PDXs
reaching a marginally larger volume than the control group
(Fig. 1A). Overall, three of the PDXs had signiﬁcant TGI with
FX11 monotherapy (P253, JH015, and P194; Fig. 1B). In this
panel, only two PDXs were KRAS WT (P410 and P420), and no
speciﬁc pattern of response to FX11 was noted based on KRAS
mutational status. Similarly, SMAD4 mutational status did not
yield any discernible pattern of response (Supplementary Table
S1). On contrary, when the waterfall plot was segregated based
on TP53 status, nearly all PDXs with any evident TGI (including
the three tumors with signiﬁcant inhibition) were TP53 mutant,
while PDXs with minimal response or marginal enhancement

A

in growth were uniformly TP53 WT. We assessed proliferation
(by Ki-67 nuclear labeling) and apoptosis (using TUNEL staining) in two TP53 WT (JH033 and JH024) and two TP53 mutant
(P253 and JH015) PDXs, and identiﬁed a signiﬁcant reduction
in proliferation, and a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis postFX11 therapy that was restricted to the TP53-mutant xenografts
(Fig. 2A and B). Overall, these ﬁndings suggested that TP53
status is likely to be a key molecular determinant of response to
pharmacologic LDH-A inhibition.
We also measured the expression of the p53 target TIGAR,
whose expression has been linked to decreased glycolytic conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Using IHC, we found that TIGAR
expression was positively correlated with TP53 WT status, and its
expression appeared diminished in TP53-mutant tumors (Fig. 3A
and B). Quantiﬁcation of the p53 and TIGAR staining intensity in
tumor sections of TP53 WT PDXs revealed a signiﬁcant increase in
p53 and TIGAR expression compared with TP53-mutant PDXs
(Fig. 3C). Baseline TIGAR mRNA expression was also reduced in
TP53-mutant tumors compared with tumors with TP53 WT
tumors, with a signiﬁcant downregulation in one of two PDXs
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
FDG-PET imaging of PDAC xenografts
In light of the differential responses to LDH-A inhibition, we

WT TP53 (JH024) and the second with a TP53 mutant
(JH015). The FDG uptake rates varied between JH024 and
JH015 tumors. At baseline (D1), JH015 tumors had elevated
FDG uptake compared with JH024, indicating greater reliance
on glycolysis (Fig. 4A and B). Notably, there were no alterations in tumor FDG uptake following 7 days of FX11 therapy
in JH024 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the avid glucose uptake
observed in JH015 xenografts at baseline was signiﬁcantly
reduced following 7 days of FX11 therapy (Fig. 4B).
Hyperpolarized 13C MR spectroscopy conﬁrms that changes in
lactate ﬂux upon FX11 therapy are restricted to TP53-mutant
xenografts
The recent development of hyperpolarized MR spectroscopic
imaging methods to probe the biochemical and metabolic proﬁle
of tumors using 13C-labeled pyruvate as the tracer, and then
monitor its intracellular conversion to various metabolites, offers
a unique opportunity to examine in vivo responses to metabolismtargeted therapies. In order to assess the metabolic conversion of
hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate, two sets of PDXs that were

study.
Representative dynamic 13C MRS spectra of JH033 tumor
(FX11 resistant) captured before FX11 treatment and 7 days FX11
treatment are shown in Fig. 5A and B, respectively. Pyruvate and
lactate peak intensities over time are shown in Fig. 5E and F. FX11
treatment was ineffective in altering the conversion ﬂux from
pyruvate to lactate in JH033. In contrast with the JH033 spectra,
dynamic 13C MRS spectra of P253 showed that pyruvate-to-lactate
conversion was signiﬁcantly reduced after 7 days of FX11 treatment as compared with spectra captured before FX11 treatment
(Fig. 5C and D), and this was conﬁrmed in the pyruvate and
lactate peak intensities over time (Fig. 5G and H). Seven days
vehicle treatment did not alter the ﬂux of hyperpolarized pyruvate
to lactate conversion in both JH033 and P253 tumors (13C MRS
spectra not shown).
The integrated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (Lac/Pyr) can be used to
represent a drug therapy response marker in this study. The Lac/
Pyr ﬂux ratio was calculated from the area under the curve (as
regarded a "Model-Free" approach) of the metabolic ﬂux from the
dynamic scan (30). The Lac/Pyr ﬂux ratios in response to FX11
treatments were signiﬁcantly different between tumors sensitive

Pyruvate-to-lactate conversion ﬂux varies in PDXs, which were resistant and sensitive to FX11 treatment. Representative dynamic C MR spectra acquired from
FX11-resistant JH033 (TP53 WT) and FX11-sensitive P253 tumor, a TP53-mutant PDX. Spectra captured before D7 FX11 treatment of JH033 and P253 are
13
shown in A–D, respectively. Sequential spectra were acquired from a 5-mm tumor slice over 150 seconds after i.v. injection of hyperpolarized [1- C] pyruvate as
13
described in Materials and Methods. Tumor lactate and pyruvate peak intensities with time after i.v. injection of hyperpolarized C pyruvate are shown

treatment (Fig. 6A). The Lac/Pyr ratios increased with time in the
resistant (JH024 and JH033) tumors (Fig. 6A). In stark contrast,
the Lac/Pyr of both sensitive tumors (P253 and JH015) showed a
striking decrease in response to FX11 treatment (Fig. 6A). The
tumor growth curves of representative tumors resistant (JH033)
and sensitive (P253) to FX11 treatment are shown in Fig. 6B and
C. We also evaluated the unidirectional conversion rate constants
(kp ¼ pyruvate-to-lactate) using modiﬁed Bloch's equation of
kinetic model (31). Consistent with the above results, the conversion rate constantly (kp) decreased in FX11-sensitive tumors
and increased in FX11-resistant tumors (Table 1).

Discussion
Persistent aerobic glycolysis is a key metabolic dependency in
tumorigenesis. LDH-A is a key regulator of glycolysis and plays
a critical role in tumor maintenance (6). LDH-A is frequently
upregulated in aggressive cancers, and expression levels frequently correlate with poor prognosis (32, 33). Furthermore,
knockdown of LDHA compromises the tumorigenic potential
of malignant cells (6). LDH-A expression is signiﬁcantly elevated in pancreatic cancer compared with paired normal tissues
(12, 34). Although forced expression of LDH-A enhances the
proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, knocking down of
LDHA transcript expression inhibited cell growth and induced
apoptosis (12). Silencing LDHA expression also inhibited
growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo, suggesting LDH-A a
potential target for pancreatic cancer therapy (12). Of note,

www.aacrjournals.org

systemic inhibition of LDH-A may not produce side effects in
humans, since hereditary LDH-A deﬁciency does not provoke
any symptoms under baseline circumstances (35).
The advent of metabolism-targeted agents has garnered
interest in identifying genetic determinants of responses to
these agents in cancer cells, especially for therapies that are
not geared directly against speciﬁc activating events like IDH1
mutations. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of a small-molecule LDH-A inhibitor across a panel of PDAC
PDXs. Human pancreatic cancer xenografts used in the present
study are annexed with desmoplastic stroma (Supplementary
Fig. S2), a well-characterized feature of primary tumors and
metastatic lesions of human PDAC (36). Masson's trichrome
staining and H&E histology from TP53 WT and TP53-mutant
tumors revealed that tumors were enriched with ﬁbrotic stroma, irrespective of their TP53 status (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We identify that the sensitivity to LDH-A inhibition is dependent on p53 status of the tumor, TP53-mutant tumors demonstrating sensitivity, and TP53 WT tumors demonstrating
refractoriness to FX11 treatment. The basis for resistance to
glycolytic inhibition could be the reduced dependence on
glucose as an elemental fuel, as TP53 wild-type PDXs had
minimal FDG uptake. Of note, expression of TIGAR was higher
in PDXs with WT TP53 function, whereas TP53 mutations
resulted in reduced TIGAR levels. TIGAR is a p53-inducible
protein that functions to lower glycolytic ﬂux and reduces
cancer cell sensitivity to reactive oxygen species associated
apoptosis (37–39). In TP53 WT cells, TIGAR expression functions to decrease the levels of fructose-2-6-biphosphate, which

FX11 treatment reduces the lactate/pyruvate ratio, selectively in PDXs sensitive to FX11 treatment. A, Lac/Pyr ratio was reduced with FX11 treatment in PDXs
sensitive to FX11 (P253 and JH015). However, the ratio was increased in PDXs resistant to FX11 treatment (JH024 and JH033). B and C, tumor growth curves

suppresses glycolysis by diverting glucose-6-phosphate into the
pentose phosphate pathway. The correlation of TIGAR expression with p53 status in pancreatic cancer PDXs could explain
one potential mechanism for the reduced sensitivity to LDH-A
inhibition in p53 WT, high TIGAR cases, by reducing glycolytic
dependence.
The understanding of cancer metabolism has deep roots in
molecular biology and genetics but the ability to detect metabolism as it occurs in tumors without a biopsy is largely limited to
PET imaging of enhanced glucose uptake into tumors using 18Fﬂuorodeoxyglucose. The recently discovered hyperpolarized MRI
using dynamic nuclear polarization technology has the potential
of providing real-time images of metabolic processes in tumors at
unprecedented levels of sensitivity for monitoring therapy
responses (40–43). Hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance
allows rapid and noninvasive monitoring of dynamic pathwayspeciﬁc metabolic and physiologic processes. Hyperpolarized 13C
MRS provides a unique ability to noninvasively assess metabolic

ﬂuxes and downstream product(s) in real time, which has been
utilized for tumor diagnosis, to stage the extent of disease, and to
monitor the response to therapy.
Transmembrane transport of pyruvate, lactate, and ketone
bodies is mediated by monocarboxylate transporters -1 and 4
(MCT-1 and MCT-4; ref. 44). It has been documented that
lactate produced by tumor cells can be taken up by stromal cells
to regenerate pyruvate that either can be extruded to refuel the
cancer cell or can be used for oxidative phosphorylation (45).
HIF1a stimulates the conversion of glucose to pyruvate and
lactate by upregulating glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT1),
hexokinase, and LDH-A, as well as the lactate-extruding enzyme
MCT-4 (46). A recent 13C MRS study conﬁrmed the modulatory
effect of LDH-A, lactate, and MCT isoforms in hyperpolarized
pyruvate to hyperpolarized lactate conversion in cancer cell lines
(47). Results obtained in our 13C MRS experiments demonstrated
a decrease in pyruvate to lactate conversion following FX11
treatment, in JH015 and P253, both TP53-mutant PDXs. In order

to characterize the contribution of tumor lactate pool, LDH-A,
HIF-1a, and MCT isoforms (MCT-1 and MCT-4) in attenuating
hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate production, we conducted
baseline gene expression analysis and measuring the tumor lactate
pool. Baseline tumor lactate, LDH-A, HIF-1a, MCT-1, and MCT-4
gene expression were not signiﬁcantly different in tumors
responded to FX11 treatment as compared with tumors resistant
to FX11 treatment (data not shown).
We measured the differences in pyruvate metabolism in pancreatic cancer xenografts, which were sensitive or resistant to
FX11 treatment. Multiple injections of hyperpolarized pyruvate
in the same animal enabled us to measure the ﬂux changes and
differential kinetics in pyruvate-to-lactate conversion within an
individual tumor over time. Of note, we were able to gauge
differences in pharmacodynamics of pyruvate to lactate conversion in real time at a point even before reduction in tumor
volumes was observed in FX11-sensitive tumors. Our studies
demonstrated the feasibility of using 13C hyperpolarized metabolic imaging as a noninvasive biomarker for monitoring
response to metabolic therapy. The capability of MRS to noninvasively obtain metabolic information is a valuable asset in the
metabolic proﬁling of tumors, and can provide molecular signatures of speciﬁc biologic processes as a complementary imaging
modality of FDG-PET.
The small number of ﬁfteen xenografts studied and the lack of
detailed investigation of factors that might also inﬂuence dependence on glycolytic metabolism, including but not limited to
intratumoral pH, O2 tension, interstitial pressure, tumor size, and
growth fraction, are limitations to this study. Even though we have
not conducted in vitro studies in support of the impact of mutant
p53 in targeting Warburg effect, previous report indicated that
tumor-associated mutant p53 stimulates the Warburg effect in
cultured cells and demonstrated that targeting altered glucose
metabolism could be a feasible therapeutic strategy for tumor
carrying mutant p53 (48). Additional studies are needed to fully
understand the mechanistic link in supportive of the inﬂuence of
mutant p53 in deciding the sensitivity of LDH-A–targeted therapy, or whether the phenomenon is demonstrable only in the
in vivo milieu. Our data show that pharmacologic inhibition of
LDH-A may have utility in the treatment of tumors by reducing
tumor growth of TP53-mutant tumors.
In summary, we observe that FX11, a LDH-A small-molecule
antagonist, attenuated in vivo tumor growth, induced apoptosis
and reduced tumor cell proliferation, speciﬁcally in pancreatic
cancer PDXs with mutant TP53. Analysis of FDG PET-CT scans of
animals demonstrate that PDXs with mutant TP53 tumors have
relatively high glucose uptake compared with tumors with TP53

WT status. In addition, using hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FX11 treatment inhibited the pyruvate to lactate conversion only in tumors with mutant
TP53 status. Currently, we do not understand the mechanistic
basis for the resistance of WT TP53 pancreatic cancer PDXs to
FX11, particularly regarding the lack of an effect on the in vivo
conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Furthermore, it is notable that
high concentrations of FX11 could have off-target effects beyond
inhibition of LDH-A. Nonetheless, our collective studies are the
ﬁrst to document a link between tumor p53 status and LDH-A
inhibitor sensitivity. Our work also suggests that the elevated
glucose metabolism in TP53-mutant tumors can be exploited for
the preferential targeting of these tumors by LDH-A inhibitor
therapy. The effectiveness of the therapy can be monitored by in
vivo metabolic imaging and can be readily applied to humans for
monitoring tumor response to therapy.
