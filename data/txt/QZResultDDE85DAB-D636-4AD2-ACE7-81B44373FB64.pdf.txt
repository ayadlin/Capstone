Abstract:

Anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-2) are pivotal
regulators of apoptotic cell death. They are all highly overexpressed in cancers of
different origin in which they enhance the survival of the cancer cells. Consequently,
they represent prime candidates for anti-cancer therapy and specific antisense
oligonucleotides or small molecule inhibitors have shown broad anti-cancer
activities in pre-clinical models and are currently tested in clinical trials. In addition,
immune-mediated tumor destruction is emerging as an interesting modality to
treat cancer patients. Notably, spontaneous cellular immune responses against the
Bcl-2 family proteins have been identified as frequent features in cancer patients
underscoring that these proteins are natural targets for the immune system. Thus,
Bcl-2 family may serve as an important and widely applicable target for anti-cancer
immunotherapeutic strategies, alone or in the combination with conventional
therapy. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of Bcl-2 family proteins as
T-cell antigens, which has set the stage for the first explorative trial using these
antigens in therapeutic vaccinations against cancer, and discuss future opportunities.

Introduction

Their effector function, e.g. secretion of pro-inflammatory
chemo-/cytokines, innate cytotoxicity and thereby release
of antigen, together with their capacity of antigen uptake
and migratory phenotype are prerequisites to mount an
adaptive immune response. Inflammatory signals allow
their migration to loco-regional lymph nodes where they
either transfer the antigen to professional APC or directly
encounter cognate naïve or memory T cells which upon
antigen recognition get activated. Primed T cells return to
circulation as memory and/or effector T cells and patrol
the organism in search of the relevant targets. While
T-helper cells influence the activation of B- and antigenpresenting cells as well as cytotoxic T cells (CTL) only the
latter have a vital function in monitoring the cells of the
body and eliminating cells that are flagged for destruction
and display the appropriate antigen. This function has
been firmly established for virus-infected cells. However,
in addition CTL are thought to provide some degree of
protection against spontaneous tumors, by virtue of their

The use of cancer vaccines to induce anti-tumor
immune responses holds huge potential to complement
traditional cancer therapies. Currently around 50 different
therapeutic cancer vaccines have reached phase III clinical
testing (not including HPV-based clinical trials) and the
FDA has recently approved the first therapeutic cancer
vaccine in the US (Dendreon’s Provenge, sipuleucel-T).
Moreover, more than 400 phase I trials and more than
430 phase II trials are testing therapeutic cancer vaccines
in the clinic (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Cancer vaccines
are designed to re-calibrate the existing host-tumour
interaction, tipping the balance from tumor acceptance
towards tumor control to the benefit of the cancer patient.
Immunization evolves in a stepwise fashion
beginning with an innate inflammatory response at the site
of danger involving mast cells, resident and/or migrant
monocytes, as well as NK cells and granulocytes [1].

ability to detect quantitative and qualitative antigenic
differences in transformed cells [2,3]. Tumorigenic
alterations result in an altered protein repertoire inside
the cell. Class I HLA molecules sample peptides from
protein-degradation inside the cell and present these at
the cell surface to CTL. Thus, it is well established that
peptide epitopes derived from human tumor-associated
antigens, can be recognized by CTL in the context of HLA
molecules [4]. Spontaneous cancers represent approx.
80% of all cancers and obviously, the antigens potentially
recognized by the immune system are basically “self”
antigens. Nevertheless, it is now well documented that
the immune system is in fact capable of recognizing
spontaneous cancers. Thus, even in the absence of
treatment, cells of the immune system in the cancer
patients specifically recognize cancer cells. Moreover,
CTL responsible for cancer cell recognition are capable
of killing cancer cells and leaving normal cells unharmed.
The molecular targets recognized – which derive from
proteins present in the cancer cells - encompass structures
that potentially are applicable in anti-cancer vaccination
strategies. A large number of such target structures have
been characterized over the past more than 10 years [5].
Due to the phenomenon of “immune escape”, in which
antigen-negative cancer cells avoid immune recognition,
strategies have been developed that conceptually focus on
specifically targeting proteins that are important for the
function, survival and growth of cancer cells [6]. Likewise,
the tumor microenvironment, and conventional disease
management has been taken into consideration. In this
regard, anti-apoptotic molecules that enhance the survival
of cancer cells and facilitate their escape from cytotoxic
therapies represent prime candidates for immunological
intervention.
Most malignancies are characterized by defects in
apoptotic signalling cascades, e.g. an overexpression of
the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin or proteins
from the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), or Mcl1). Numerous studies have demonstrated Bcl-2 overexpression in solid tumors, including melanoma, breast,
colorectal, prostate, and small cell lung cancer as well
as cancers of hematological origin [7-12]. Bcl-X(L) is
likewise implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and
increased expression is a characteristic of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma, as well as solid
cancers like bladder cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic
cancer and melanoma [13]. While co-expression of Bcl2 and Bcl-X(L) is seen in some cancers, others exhibit
exclusive expression of one or the other protein. In
contrast to our current understanding of Bcl-2 and BclX(L), considerably less is known about the role of other
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. However, elevated
levels of Mcl-1 have been reported for a number of solid
tumors and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)
as well as and AML and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)
upon relapse [13-16] .
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Attempts to overcome the cytoprotective effects
of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 in cancer include several
different strategies (as reviewed in [17]): (i) shutting
off gene transcription, (ii) inducing mRNA degradation
with antisense oligonucleotides [18], and (iii) directly
attacking the proteins with small-molecule drugs [1921]. A randomized clinical trial for metastatic melanoma
comparing dacarbazine alone with dacarbazine and Bcl-2
antisense demonstrated an increase in response rates and
improved survival in patients with less aggressive disease,
but not in patients with more aggressive disease [22]. In
addition to the above-mentioned means of targeting,
immune-mediated tumor destruction is emerging as an
interesting modality to treat cancer patients. Notably,
during the last decade spontaneous cellular immune
responses against regulators of apoptosis proteins have
been identified as frequent features in cancer patients.
As a result hereof, survivin-directed immunotherapy was
quickly moved to the clinic [23,24] and several survivinbased vaccination trials are currently ongoing at different
institutes. However, whereas survivin has been given
much attention as a T-cell target, the Bcl-2 family has as
yet received somewhat less attention. Here, we summarize
current knowledge of Bcl-2 family proteins as T-cell
antigen and discuss future opportunities.

Bcl-2
Bcl-2 is a pivotal regulator of apoptotic cell
death, and it is overexpressed in many cancers [25].
Consequently, the Bcl-2 protein is an attractive target for
drug design and Bcl-2 specific antisense oligonucleotides
or small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors have shown broad anticancer activities in pre-clinical models and are currently
in clinical testing [26]. However, Bcl-2 is in addition the
target of spontaneous T-cell reactivity in cancer patients
[27]. Hence, analyses of the protein sequence for HLAbinding motifs and subsequent testing of blood of tumor
patients revealed spontaneous T-cell reactivity against
Bcl-2 in patients suffering from unrelated tumor types,
i.e., melanoma, pancreatic and breast cancer, as well
as AML and B-CLL. These spontaneously occurring
immune responses comprised of cytotoxic effector cells.
This notion could be confirmed by ex vivo analysis
of Bcl-2 reactive T cells which were capable of killing
HLA-matched tumor cells [27]. Moreover, CTL clones
recognizing Bcl-2-derived epitopes efficiently killed
cancer cells of different origin, e.g., colorectal cancer,
breast cancer and melanoma cells [28].
Bcl-2 is implicated in cancer development, tumor
progression and protection of cells from a wide range
of cytotoxic insults, including cytokine deprivation,
irradiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs [29]. However,
although Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein a rather
paradoxical role of Bcl-2 have been described, showing an
association between high Bcl-2 expression and improved
240

Bcl-X(L) epitopes in healthy controls. Furthermore, BclX(L) specific T cells not only killed target cells pulsed
with the antigenic peptide but also recognized tumor
cells endogenously expressing the Bcl-X(L) protein in an
antigen specific and HLA-restricted manner [38]. Thus,
whereas HLA-matched cancer cell lines of different origin
were very effectively lysed by the Bcl-X(L) specific T
cells, there was no lysis of the HLA-mismatched breast
cancer cells. The killing of tumor cells of different origin
underlines the universal characteristics of Bcl-X(L) as a
tumor antigen. Importantly, the Bcl-X(L)-specific T cells
did not only lyse in vitro generated tumor cell lines, but in
addition lysed ex vivo enriched AML cells demonstrating
that killing is not restricted to long-term cell lines. Since
T cells and B cells normally express Bcl-X(L) following
activation, Bcl-X(L) can not be considered to be a cancerspecific protein and caution is required when targeting this
protein in vaccination therapies. However, the Bcl-X(L)specific T cells did not kill purified B and T cells, which
suggest that although non-malignant, B cells and T cells
express Bcl-X(L), they escape recognition from Bcl-X(L)
specific T cells. Similar findings have been reported for
another anti-apoptotic protein, survivin. Thus, although
activated B and T cells express survivin, survivin-specific
CTL did not recognize and kill such cells ex vivo [39].

survival in different cancers [30,31]. Bcl-2 expression and
prognosis has been correlated for breast cancer patients
even if treated with chemotherapy [32]. Likewise, Bcl-2
expression has been associated with improved prognosis
even among patients at very high risk for distant relapse
[33]. In melanoma, it has been described that Bcl-2
expression was significantly higher in the primary tumors
as compared to metastatic lesions [31]. These findings
were unexpected since over-expression of Bcl‑2 in tumor
cell results in enhanced resistance to apoptosis in vitro
[12]. The biological basis for the association between
high Bcl-2 expression and improved survival is unclear.
An explanation may be that poorly differentiated tumors
depend on other prosurvival pathways, and decreased
Bcl-2 expression merely is a marker of aggressive
tumor behaviour rather than mechanistically associated
with aggressive biology [25]. However, it could in
addition suggest a pivotal role of Bc-2 specific T cells
in immunosurveillance of cancer. The loss of the Bcl-2
expression during progression from primary to metastatic
melanoma in patients suggests an active immune selection
of the respective melanoma clones by the tumor bearing
host, e.g. via a specific immune response.

Bcl-X(L)

Mcl-1

The bcl-x gene is transcribed into two mRNAs
through alternative splicing. The anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-X(L) is produced from the long isoform, while proapoptotic Bcl-X(S) is derived from the short isoform
mRNA [34]. The protein product of the larger Bcl-X(L)
differs from Bcl-X(S) protein by an inserted region (amino
acids 126-188). The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L) plays
an important role in cancer as it has been directly linked
to resistance to conventional forms of therapies and poor
prognosis [13]. Increased expression of Bcl-X(L) has been
reported in a variety of different malignancies including
AML and multiple myeloma as well as solid cancers
like bladder cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and
melanoma [13]. The functional inhibition of Bcl-X(L)
restores the apoptotic process and renders neoplastic
cells sensitive to chemical and radiation therapies,
whereas manipulation of cancer cell lines to express
high levels of Bcl-X(L) results in a multi-drug resistance
phenotype. Thus, the attractiveness of targeting Bcl-X(L)
in vaccination is based on the fact that downregulation or
loss of expression of this protein as some form of immune
escape would impair sustained tumor growth. The
combination of immunotherapy targeting Bcl-X(L) with
conventional chemotherapy appears to be particularly
appealing since expression of this protein is correlated
with drug resistance [35,36]. It was demonstrated that
breast cancer patients, melanoma patients and pancreatic
cancer patients host spontaneous HLA-restricted T-cell
responses specifically against Bcl-X(L)-derived peptides
[37]. In contrast, no responses were detected against

The lower rates of relapse in allogeneic
transplantation compared with autologous bone marrow
transplantation, the striking clinical benefit of donorlymphocyte infusions as well as the finding that human
T cells can destroy chemotherapy-resistant cell lines from
chronic myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma, have
prompted development of immunotherapeutic strategies
against haematological cancers [40]. Among these
approaches, active specific immunization or vaccination
is emerging as a valuable tool to boost the adaptive
immune system against malignant cells. Mcl-1 is an
apoptosis-inhibiting member of the Bcl-2 family that is
expressed in early monocyte differentiation. Elevated
levels of Mcl-1 have been reported for a number of solid
and hematopoitic cancers, e.g. CLL and in AML and ALL
upon relapse [13,15,16]. In CLL patients, higher levels
of Mcl-1 are strongly correlated with failure to achieve
complete remission after single-agent therapy. In multiple
myeloma Mcl-1 plays an important role in the survival of
malignant cells [41].
Using the IFN-g ELISPOT we demonstrated that both
hematopoetic and solid cancer patients host spontaneous
T-cell responses against Mcl-1-derived peptides [42-44].
Thus, strong and frequent CTL responses against Mcl1 were detected in CLL patients, melanoma patients,
pancreatic cancer patients and breast cancer patients,
whereas no responses could be detected in healthy
individuals. Mcl-1 specific T-cell clones effectively lysed

increase a vaccination induced T-cell response. Because
cytotoxic chemotherapy is widely used to treat most
malignancies, integrating tumor vaccines with standard
chemotherapeutic drugs is highly attractive. Several
different models have explained how chemotherapy may
improve subsequent or even concurrent immune therapy.
Recent investigations have focused on the impact on
regulatory cells [53,54]. In addition, chemotherapy might
enhances tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing
[55]. Furthermore, it has been described that Antracyclins
induce translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface
leading to immunogenic uptake of tumor antigens [56].
Rational treatment strategies that combine tumor
vaccines with cytotoxic drugs can be integrated in at least
three ways as suggested by Emens and Jaffee [51]. First,
chemotherapeutics can be combined with surgery and
radiation to achieve a state of minimal residual disease,
thereby altering the balance of the disease burden and
the vaccine-induced T-cell response in favour of the T
cell. Second, chemotherapy can be used to groom the
local tumor microenvironment to optimally support a
productive immune response. Finally, chemotherapy
can be used to set the stage for a robust vaccine-induced
immune response by globally altering immunoregulation
within the host, subsequently permitting a robust vaccineinduced immune response.
Drug resistance is the major problem that limits the
effectiveness of chemotherapies used in the treatment of
cancer [57]. Drug resistance is believed to cause treatment
failure in more than 90% of patients with metastatic
cancer. Cancer-associated defects in apoptosis play a vital
role in resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [58].
An important reason for this impaired apoptosis is an overexpression of the anti-apoptotic regulators of apoptosis
proteins, i.e. the Bcl-2 family [17]. Consequently,
the combination of immunotherapy targeting these
antigens with conventional chemotherapy appears to be
particularly appealing. In a combinational therapeutic
setting, conventional therapy would kill the majority of
the cancer cells, leaving only cells that express high levels
of antigens. Such high-expressers would be particularly
vulnerable to killing by vaccination induced T cells.
Thus, the synergy of these measures could potentially
give a more effective treatment than the added effect
of either regime alone; thereby strengthen the already
described synergistic effect of anti-cancer vaccines and
chemotherapy.

HLA-matched melanoma cells [45]. Moreover, Mcl-1specific T cells lyse ex vivo enriched AML cells.

Co-targeting of the Bcl-2 family
Many anti-cancer vaccination strategies are already
focusing on the combination with other immunotherapeutic
strategies, e.g. the addition of cytokines or immune
modulating agents. However, so far most peptide based
vaccination trials have targeted only a single antigen.
To maximize the impact of immunotherapy, an exciting
strategy would be to co-target biologically connected
proteins, e.g. the Bcl-2 family, in a multi-epitope setting.
In this regard, Tanaka et al described that the co-expression
of different apoptosis regulators in breast carcinoma was
strongly associated with reduced apoptotic index (AI) and
poor overall survival [46]. A similar association has been
described in other cancers [47-49]. Thus, in most human
cancers, inhibition of apoptosis is a general feature, and
expression of anti-apoptosis genes, e.g. survivin and/or
Bcl-2 family, may cause more pronounced antiapoptotic
effects, as reflected in reduced AI. Although regulators
of apoptosis proteins are up regulated in almost all
cancers there may be significant quantitative divergences
concerning the amount of each protein in individual
patients suffering from the same disease. Previously, we
have generated Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and survivin specific
cytotoxic T cell clones and examined the killing of a
panel of cancer cell lines [50]. Although all cancer cell
lines were recognized and lysed by the T-cell clones the
most effective lysis varied greatly among the cell lines.
Thus, some target cells were killed most efficiently by
Bcl-2 specific T cells, some by Survivin specific T cells
and some by Bcl-X(L) specific T cells. Although this
notion needs to be substantiated in large scale studies in
which the clinical and prognostic significance of the CTL
responses is scrutinized, it could point to a scenario in
which the targeting of more than one of the targets would
be beneficial in a clinical setting.

Combination with conventional
therapy
Even few years ago the concept of combining
chemotherapy – one of the side effects of which is
suppression of immune function – with active immune
therapy, was unheard of. However, recent data from the
clinic suggests a synergistic effect of anti-cancer vaccines
and chemotherapy. As an example hereof, the combination
of immunotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy has been
described to improve the severe immunodeficiency and
leave to the induction of clinically relevant immunity
in myeloma patients [51]. Notably, lympho-ablation,
e.g. induced by chemotherapy, enhances the efficacy of
adoptive T-cell transfer [52]. Subsequently, it may also

Conclusion
It has been have reported that spontanous specific
T-cell responses against the anti-apoptotic members of
the Bcl-2 family are frequent in cancer patients and that
these T cells are highly cytotoxic against cancer cells.
Hence, Bcl-2 antigens appear to be a very attactrive target
for anti-cancer immunotherapy both in hematopoetic and
