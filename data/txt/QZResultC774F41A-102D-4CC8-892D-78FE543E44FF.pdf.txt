Abstract
The regulation of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) in cancer chemotherapy is not fully
understood. Here, we show that the histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors induce TRAIL in human breast cancer
cells. Induction of TRAIL by the HDAC inhibitor MS275 can be
enhanced by Adriamycin. Using different reporter constructs
in conjunction with transcription activity assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we provide evidence that the
transcription factor Sp1 is responsible for TRAIL induction by
MS275 alone or in combination with Adriamycin. Further, we
show that the combined treatment of breast cancer cells with
MS275 and Adriamycin significantly increases apoptotic cell
death via the activation of both death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Down-regulation of TRAIL by
small interfering RNA silencing decreased MS275-mediated
Adriamycin-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, thus
conferring Adriamycin resistance. More importantly, breast
cancer T47D cells in which Sp1 was knocked down or Sp1knockout mouse embryonic stem cells were resistant to the
combined treatments. Taken together, our results indicate
that induction of TRAIL by the combined treatments
with MS275 and Adriamycin is mediated by Sp1 and suggest
that transcription factor Sp1 is an important target for
the development of novel anticancer agents. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family (1, 2). TRAIL selectively
induces apoptosis of transformed or tumor cells but not normal
cells, making it a promising new agent for cancer therapy (1, 2).
There are four membrane-bound receptors for TRAIL: DR4 (3),
DR5 (4–8), TRAIL-R3 (6, 9–11), and TRAIL-R4 (12, 13). DR4 and
DR5 both contain a conserved death domain motif and are
proapoptotic receptors (14), whereas TRAIL-R3 lacks an intracellular domain and TRAIL-R4 has a truncated death domain. Thus,
both TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 act as decoy receptors to
antagonize TRAIL-induced apoptosis by competing for ligand
binding (14, 15). Binding of TRAIL to DR4 or DR5 triggers
formation of the death-inducing signaling complex by recruiting
Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8 or caspase-10,
resulting in the activation of caspase-8 or caspase-10, which in

turn activates caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 to cleave death
substrates and cause cell death. Activated caspase-8 can cleave
the proapoptotic Bcl2 family member Bid to generate truncated
Bid. Truncated Bid translocates to the mitochondria to cause
cytochrome c release, which amplifies the apoptotic signal from
the TRAIL pathway.
It has been shown that DR5 could be transcriptionally induced
by some anticancer drugs (4, 16), thus sensitizing cancer cells to
TRAIL (16, 17). However, the regulation of TRAIL ligand
expression is much less understood. The TRAIL promoter
contains a number of transcription regulatory elements including
IFN-stimulated response element, nuclear factor nB, and Sp1
(18, 19). It has been shown that IFNs directly induce TRAIL in
both human leukemia Jurkat and colon cancer HT29 cells
(18, 19). IFN-g also acts as a mediator to induce TRAIL in
response to retinoid treatment (20). The induction of TRAIL via
an IFN-stimulated response element results in apoptosis (20, 21).
In addition, the TAX oncoprotein encoded by human T-cell
leukemia virus induces TRAIL through the nuclear factor-nB–
dependent pathway (22). TRAIL is also induced by T-cell
receptor mimetics in human T cells, and such induction involves
a c-Rel binding site in the proximal TRAIL promoter (23).
However, the regulation of TRAIL by cancer chemotherapy is not
fully understood.
The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are novel anticancer
agents that can activate transcription of target genes via histone
acetylation (24). By activation of gene expression, HDAC
inhibitors may induce cell differentiation, growth arrest, and
apoptosis. The ability of HDAC inhibitors to induce apoptosis is
attributed to the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptotic pathways (25). Several HDAC inhibitors, including
valproic acid, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and the
benzamide derivative MS275, exhibit antitumor activity with little
toxicity to normal cells both in vitro and in vivo (24). Recent
studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors induce leukemiaselective apoptosis through the TRAIL apoptotic pathway (26, 27)
and sensitize leukemia cells to anticancer agents (28). In addition,
it has been shown that HDAC inhibitors induce DR5 and
subsequently sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated cell death
(29). How activation of TRAIL pathway contributes to HDAC
inhibitor–induced apoptosis in solid tumors is of critical
importance and needs to be determined.
In this article, we show that the HDAC inhibitor MS275 induces
TRAIL via an Sp1-dependent pathway. MS275-mediated TRAIL
induction was enhanced by Adriamycin at both the RNA and
protein levels. The induction of TRAIL by MS275 enhanced
Adriamycin-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.
Down-regulation of TRAIL by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
decreased Adriamycin-mediated cell death induced by MS275.
Importantly, T47D cells in which Sp1 was knocked down or Sp1
null embryonic stem cells were more resistant to Adriamycin,

MS275, or combination treatment as compared with their
counterparts with intact Sp1. Thus, our data indicate that Sp1mediated TRAIL induction plays a critical role in chemosensitivity
and suggest that Sp1 is a therapeutic target for the development of
novel anticancer therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. MS275 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. SAHA was
purchased from Cayman. Adriamycin was obtained from the Oncology
Outpatient Pharmacy at the Karmanos Cancer Institute. Monoclonal
antihuman TRAIL, DR4, and polyclonal DR5 antibodies were purchased
from Imgenex. Rabbit anti–caspase-9, anti–caspase-8, anti–caspase-3, and
anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) polyclonal antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal p21 antibody was
purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-actin antibody was purchased from
Sigma. Sp1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology.
Cell lines, culture conditions, and treatment. The human breast
cancer MCF7 cells were obtained from Karmanos Cancer Institute and
maintained in DMEM/F-12. The human breast cancer MDA231 and T47D
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained
in DMEM. Cells were supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) for MDA231 and T47D or 5% FBS for MCF7 and antibiotics at 37jC in
a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Sp1-knockout
mouse embryonic stem cells (Sp1 / ) and their normal control embryonic
stem cells (Sp1+/+) were previously described (30) and maintained in
Glasgow MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine, 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate, 1 nonessential amino acids, 10% FBS, h-mercaptoethanol, and leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon). Embryonic stem cells were
grown in bovine gelatin–coated dishes.
Isolation of RNA and Northern blot analysis. The procedures for
preparation of total RNA and Northern blot analysis were previously
described (31).
siRNA transfection for knockdown of TRAIL and Sp1. OnTARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs for TRAIL, Sp1, and corresponding
control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon Research. The transfection was done as suggested by Dharmacon with slight modifications, as
described previously (32). Briefly, T47D cells were plated at 6  105 per
well in six-well plates. The next day, cells were transfected with TRAIL,
Sp1, or nontarget control oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 3 d, transfected cells were left untreated or treated with MS275
(5 Amol/L), Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), or their combination for 48 h and
then harvested for assessing the expression of TRAIL and Sp1 and the
activation of the caspase cascade by Western blot analysis. To determine
chemosensitivity, cells with or without transfections were placed at 8,000
per well in 96-well plates and then treated with MS275, Adriamycin, or
their combination for 48 h, and cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays.
MTT assays. MTT assays were described previously (33).
Western blot analysis. The procedures for preparation of whole-cell
protein lysates and Western blot analysis were described previously (33).
Assay of caspase-3 activity. The enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was
assayed using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit (R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were left untreated or treated with
MS275, Adriamycin, or their combination for 48 h and then lysed in lysis
buffer for 10 min on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for
5 min, and 150-Ag protein was incubated with 50 AL of reaction buffer and
5 AL of caspase-3 substrate at 37jC for 2 h, and the absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 405 nm on a plate reader.
Construction of reporter vectors. TRAIL reporter constructs pGL3TRAIL2, pGL3-TRAIL5, and pGL3-TRAIL6 were previously described (33).
TRAIL5mu in which the second Sp1 binding site was mutated was amplified
from pGL3-TRAIL2 using GC-Rich PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the primers 5¶-CCGCTCGAGAGGAAATTTTCTTTACAGTT3¶ and 5¶-CCCAAGCTTGATCCTGTCAGAGTCTGACTGCTG-3¶. The PCR
conditions were as follows: 95jC/3 min; 30 cycles at 95jC/30 s, 45jC/30 s,

and 68jC/2 min; followed by 68jC/7 min for the final extension. The
amplified fragment was isolated from 1% agarose gel, digested with XhoI and
HindIII, and subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega). The insert was verified
by DNA sequencing.
Luciferase reporter assays. Transfections for luciferase assays were
carried out as described previously (33). Briefly, T47D cells were plated at
8  105 per well in six-well plates. The next day, the cells were transfected
with 5 Ag of reporter constructs and 5 ng of pRLSV40 (Promega) using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, transfected cells were
treated with or without 5 Amol/L MS275, 0.1 Ag/mL Adriamycin, or their
combination for 24 h. Firefly luciferase activities were assayed using the
dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Turner TD20/20
luminometer and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
was done with the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as described
previously (33). The PCR primers used in chromatin immunoprecipitation
were 5¶-AATGGGCTTGAGGTGAGTGCAGAT-3¶ and 5¶-ATGAGTTGTTTTTCTGGGTTCTGT-3¶.
ELISA for Sp1 transcription activity. T47D cells were left untreated or
treated with MS275 (5 Amol/L), Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), or their
combination for 24 h and nuclear protein was extracted with a Nuclear
Extraction kit (Panomics). Nuclear protein was then quantified using
the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). A total of 15 Ag of nuclear protein from each treatment were analyzed for Sp1 activity using the Transcription Factor ELISA kit (Panomics). Sp1 antibody was used as primary
antibody and antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary
antibody. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm on a
spectrophotometer.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using Student’s t test.
The data were presented as the mean F SD, and P V 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
HDAC inhibitors induce TRAIL expression in human breast
cancer cells. The regulation of TRAIL by cancer chemotherapy in
solid tumor cell lines is not fully understood. We treated three
breast cancer cell lines, MDA231, T47D, and MCF7, with various
doses of MS275 for 24 hours, and induction of TRAIL was
determined by Western blot analysis. Figure 1 shows that TRAIL
protein was induced in all three lines at different doses of MS275
and that such treatments seem to have no effect on the levels of
DR4 and DR5 proteins except for an increase in DR5 protein in
MCF7 cells treated with 5 Amol/L MS275. Consistent with previous
studies (26, 27), p21 was induced by MS275, which served as a
positive control. TRAIL mRNA was also increased by MS275
treatment (Fig. 1B). Further, we found that SAHA, another HDAC
inhibitor, can also induce TRAIL expression (Fig. 1A). These data
suggest that TRAIL induction by HDAC inhibitors is a common
event in breast cancer cells.
MS275 sensitizes human breast cancer cells to Adriamycin.
We previously showed that induction of TRAIL by TNFa and 5-aza2¶-deoxycytidine plays a critical role in sensitizing breast cancer
cells to chemotherapy (33, 34). To determine the role of TRAIL
induction in breast cancer cell death induced by Adriamycin, we
first tested the effect of MS275 treatment alone on the growth of
breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, MS275 inhibited the
growth of all three cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. We next
asked whether the effect of MS275 on growth inhibition could be
enhanced by anticancer agents. Figure 2B shows that the growth
inhibition was f86% in cells treated with MS275 in combination
with Adriamycin, as compared with f50% and f33% in cells
treated with MS275 and Adriamycin alone, respectively. These data
suggest that MS275 could sensitize T47D cells to Adriamycin.

To determine the underlying mechanisms by which MS275
sensitizes T47D cells to Adriamycin, we tested the activation of the
apoptotic pathways because HDAC inhibitors can kill cancer cells
by apoptosis (25). Figure 2C shows that Adriamycin or MS275
treatment alone causes modest cleavage of caspase-9 and PARP.
In contrast, the combination of 5 Amol/L MS275 with 0.1 Ag/mL
Adriamycin significantly enhanced cleavage of caspase-9, caspase3, and PARP (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the combined treatments
resulted in a significant increase in cleavage of caspase-8, which
was not obvious in cells treated with either agent alone (Fig. 2C).
In addition, the combined treatment also enhanced caspase-3
activity (Fig. 2D) relative to the treatments with either agent alone.
Collectively, these data suggest that the enhanced cell killing by the
combined treatments is attributable to the augmented induction of
apoptosis.
Sp1 is responsible for TRAIL induction by MS275 alone or in
combination with Adriamycin. To define the mechanisms of
TRAIL regulation by MS275, we transfected T47D cells with either
the TRAIL luciferase reporter construct pGL3-TRAIL2 or empty
vector pGL3-Basic, followed by treatment with MS275 (5 Amol/L).
Cells were harvested after 24 hours, and luciferase activity
was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system.
Figure 3B shows that transfections of pGL3-TRAIL2 containing a
504-bp fragment upstream of translational start site result in an
f2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to MS275
treatment, as compared with untreated cells. To understand TRAIL
regulation by MS275 in detail, we tested the effects of MS275 on
luciferase activity using several deletion constructs (Fig. 3A). As
shown in Fig. 3B, pGL3-TRAIL5 containing two Sp1 sites was still
activated by MS275 whereas pGL3-TRAIL6 with one Sp1 binding
site was inert. This suggests that the second Sp1 is critical for

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

MS275-mediated TRAIL induction. To further confirm this, we
mutated the second Sp1 site in pGL3-TRAIL5mu and found that
pGL3-TRAIL5mu is no longer responsive to MS275 treatment,
suggesting that the second Sp1 binding site is responsible for
transactivation of the TRAIL promoter by MS275.
Because MS275 could sensitize T47D cells to Adriamycin
(Fig. 2), we asked if the combination of MS275 with Adriamycin
has any effects on the TRAIL promoter. To answer this question,
T47D cells transfected with TRAIL reporter constructs were
treated with either agent alone or in combination and then
assayed for the TRAIL promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 3B,
although Adriamycin alone had no effects on the TRAIL promoter
activity, the combination of MS275 with Adriamycin resulted in a
more pronounced increase in the activation of the TRAIL
promoter as compared with cells treated with MS275 alone.
Similar to the results obtained with MS275, loss of the second Sp1
binding site abolished the activation of the TRAIL promoter by
the combined treatments (Fig. 3B). Importantly, we showed that
the combined treatments increase the level of TRAIL protein, as
compared with cells treated with either agent alone (Fig. 3C).
Interestingly, in spite of the fact that Adriamycin alone had no
effect on the activation of the TRAIL promoter, Adriamycin could
augment MS275-mediated activation of the TRAIL promoter,
suggesting that this Adriamycin-mediated effect may be indirect.
Collectively, these results indicate that the second Sp1 site is
critical for the activation of the TRAIL promoter by MS275 alone
or in combination with Adriamycin.
To determine whether Sp1 binds directly to the TRAIL promoter
in response to MS275 or the combined treatment, we conducted
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the TRAIL promoter
with anti-Sp1 antibody. T47D cells were left untreated or treated

with MS275 (5 Amol/L), Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), or their
combination and then harvested 24 hours later for the chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments. Figure 4A and B shows that
PCR amplification of the immunoprecipitated chromatin with Sp1
antibody results in single bands of a size expected for the TRAIL
promoter. Importantly, there were higher levels of amplified DNA
in MS275-treated cells than observed in untreated cells. Moreover,
the combined treatment resulted in more robust DNA amplification than that of cells treated with MS275 alone. In addition,
although Adriamycin did not activate TRAIL promoter constructs
(Fig. 3B), we observed a slight increase in DNA amplification in
Adriamycin-treated cells as compared with untreated cells. To
further investigate the activation of Sp1 transcription, we extracted
nuclear proteins from cells treated with MS275, Adriamycin,

or their combination and used ELISA kit to assay the Sp1
transcription activity. As shown in Fig. 4C, either MS275 or
Adriamycin treatment resulted in a modest increase in Sp1
transcription activity as compared with untreated cells. In contrast,
the combination of MS275 and Adriamycin resulted in an f4-fold
increase in Sp1 transcription activity. Taken together, these results
suggest that the induction of TRAIL by MS275 alone or in
combination with Adriamycin is mediated by the transcription
factor Sp1.
Induction of TRAIL by MS275 is required for sensitization of
T47D cells to Adriamycin-induced apoptosis. We have shown
that MS275 induces TRAIL and that the combination of MS275 and
Adriamycin enhances cell death relative to either agent alone. We
asked whether TRAIL induction by MS275 is required for this

enhanced killing effect. To this end, we transfected T47D cells with
either control siRNA or siRNA against TRAIL, and then tested the
effect of siRNA-mediated TRAIL down-regulation on cell death. As
shown in Fig. 5A, the basal levels of TRAIL protein in cells
transfected with TRAIL siRNA were decreased as compared with
cells transfected with control siRNA. Further, the induction of
TRAIL by MS275 was also decreased in cells transfected with
TRAIL siRNA as compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA. Importantly, we found that cells transfected with TRAIL
siRNA were more resistant to MS275, Adriamycin, or their
combination, as compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA (Fig. 5C), suggesting that TRAIL is important for cell death
induced by such treatments. Because TRAIL is a potent apoptosis
inducer, we investigated the effects of down-regulation of TRAIL on
MS275-mediated Adriamycin-induced apoptosis. Cells transfected
with TRAIL or control siRNA were treated with MS275 (5 Amol/L),
Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), or their combination for 48 hours, and the
activation of the apoptotic pathways was then examined. As shown
in Fig. 5B, cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP
was significant in cells treated with both MS275 and Adriamycin, as
compared with untreated or cells treated with MS275 alone,
whereas such changes were minimal in Adriamycin-treated cells. In
contrast, cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP was
decreased in cells transfected with TRAIL siRNA following the
combined treatment (Fig. 5B). Additionally, we found that such
treatments increased caspase-3 activity, which was abolished in
cells transfected with TRAIL siRNA (data not shown), indicating
that down-regulation of TRAIL impairs the activation of the
caspase cascade induced by the combined treatment, thereby
enhancing cell survival. Collectively, these results suggest that
TRAIL plays an important role in MS275-mediated Adriamycininduced apoptosis.
Role of Sp1 in chemosensitivity. We have shown that TRAIL
expression is regulated by Sp1. Because TRAIL induction plays an
important role in apoptosis (26, 27), we asked whether Sp1 could
substitute TRAIL to induce apoptosis by MS275 in the presence or

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

absence of Adriamycin. To answer this question, we transfected
T47D cells with Sp1 or control siRNA and then treated transfected
cells with MS275 (5 Amol/L), Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), or their
combination for 48 hours, and the growth inhibition was then
examined. As shown in Fig. 6A, the levels of Sp1 in cells transfected
with Sp1 siRNA were significantly decreased as compared with cells
transfected with control siRNA. Interestingly, we did not detect the
changes in the levels of Sp1 protein in response to the treatments
(Fig. 6A), suggesting that increased Sp1 transcription activity
(Fig. 4) may not be due to an increase in the total level of Sp1
protein. However, we found that induction of TRAIL by MS275 was
abolished in Sp1 siRNA–transfected cells as compared with control
siRNA–transfected cells. Furthermore, the induction of TRAIL by
the combination was also decreased when Sp1 was down-regulated
(Fig. 6A). These data indicate that induction of TRAIL by MS275
alone or in combination with Adriamycin is dependent on the
presence of Sp1.
To determine the effect of Sp1 knockdown on cell viability, T47D
cells transfected with either Sp1 or control siRNA were treated with
MS275, Adriamycin, or their combination for 48 hours, and cell
viability was then determined. Figure 6C shows that cells transfected with Sp1 siRNA are more resistant to MS275, Adriamycin, or
their combination, as compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA, which is similar to the results obtained with cells in which
TRAIL was down-regulated (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that Sp1dependent TRAIL expression is critical for cell death induced by
MS275, Adriamycin, or their combination.
To investigate the effects of down-regulation of Sp1 on MS275mediated Adriamycin-induced apoptosis, cells transfected with Sp1
or control siRNA were treated with MS275 (5 Amol/L), Adriamycin
(0.1 Ag/mL), or their combination for 48 hours, and activation of
caspases and cleavage of PARP was examined. As expected, in cells
transfected with control siRNA, cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8,
caspase-3, and PARP was significantly increased in cells that
received the combined treatments, as compared with untreated
cells, whereas such changes were minimal in either agent-treated

cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast, such changes were decreased in cells
transfected with Sp1 siRNA following the combined treatment
(Fig. 6B), indicating that down-regulation of Sp1 decreases
activation of the caspase cascade induced by the combined
treatment, leading to improved cell survival. Taken together, these
results suggest that Sp1 plays an important role in MS275-mediated
Adriamycin-induced caspase activation and apoptosis.
Role of Sp1 in chemosensitivity in Sp1-knockout mouse
embryonic stem cells. We have shown that down-regulation of
Sp1 by siRNA decreases T47D cell death induced by the combined
treatment with MS275 and Adriamycin (Fig. 6C). Because Sp1
expression could not be completely eliminated by siRNA silencing
(Fig. 6A), the results obtained with an siRNA approach may not
completely reflect the role of Sp1 in chemosensitivity. To overcome
this difficulty, we examined the role of Sp1 in chemosensitivity
using Sp1-knockout mouse embryonic stem cells. As expected, fulllength Sp1 was expressed in Sp1+/+ embryonic stem cells but not in
Sp1 / embryonic stem cells (Fig. 6D, top), confirming Sp1 deletion
in Sp1 / cells. We then treated these cells with MS275,
Adriamycin, or their combination, and the effects of such
treatments on cell death were assessed. As shown in Fig. 6D
(bottom), Sp1 / cells were more resistant than Sp1+/+ cells to
MS275 or Adriamycin; there were f57% and f74% of surviving
Sp1 / cells as compared with f43% and f42% of surviving
Sp1+/+ cells following the treatments with MS275 and Adriamycin,
respectively. More importantly, we showed that the combined
treatment results in a significant increase in cell survival of Sp1 /
cells as compared with Sp1+/+ cells (42% versus 18%). In addition,
we showed that TRAIL is induced in Sp1+/+ but not in Sp1 / cells
by the combined treatments (Fig. 6D, top), further confirming the
requirement of Sp1 for TRAIL induction by the combined
treatment. Thus, these results suggest that Sp1 plays a critical role
in cell death induced by combined treatment with MS275 and
Adriamycin, which may be through the induction of TRAIL and
activation of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway.

knockdown impairs caspase-mediated cell death induced by
chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, we showed that Sp1
knockout decreased mouse embryonic stem cell death induced
by MS275, Adriamycin, or their combination, particularly for the
combined treatments. However, it is not clear whether Sp1 plays a
role in sensitizing other cancer cells to additional anticancer
agents, which requires further investigation. Additionally, although
Sp1 is a basal transcription factor and has many target genes, it is
possible that in some cells after chemotherapeutic drug treatment,
Sp1 might preferentially activate some apoptosis-related genes (e.g.,

Discussion
In this study, we show that MS275 induces TRAIL, which
sensitizes human breast cancer T47D cells and mouse embryonic
stem cells to Adriamycin-induced death. We also show that the
underlying mechanism of such sensitization is mediated by the
transcription factor Sp1 because Sp1 knockdown or deletion
abolishes TRAIL induction and subsequently renders cells resistant
to MS275, Adriamycin, or their combination. Thus, our findings
indicate for the first time that the transcription factor Sp1 plays a
critical role in chemosensitivity and thereby is a potential
therapeutic target for the development of novel anticancer agents.
Sp1 was the first mammalian transcription factor to be identified
(35). It binds to GC-rich sequences to regulate gene expression (36).
Although Sp1 is a basal transcription factor, recent studies
suggested that it plays an important role in tumor growth and
metastasis. For example, Sp1 is overexpressed in both gastric and
pancreatic cancers, and overexpression of Sp1 enhances the
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which promotes
cancer angiogenesis (37, 38). However, it is not known whether Sp1
plays a role in the responses of cancer cells to chemotherapy. In
this study, we showed that knockdown of Sp1 in T47D cells
abolishes cell death induced by MS275, Adriamycin, or their
combination. We also showed that knockdown of Sp1 in T47D cells
substantially decreases the activation of the caspase cascade
induced by the combined treatments, suggesting that Sp1

TRAIL) to induce cell death. Because Sp1 is overexpressed in some
cancers (37, 39), anticancer drugs that can activate Sp1-dependent
TRAIL expression might be effective against these tumors, and this
requires further investigation. Nevertheless, this study provides the
first proof-of-principal to target Sp1 for cancer therapy.
What are the underlying mechanisms by which Sp1 favors cell
death induced by test agents? We believe that Sp1 could
transcriptionally activate TRAIL, leading to the activation of
the TRAIL apoptotic pathway because knockdown of Sp1
decreased TRAIL induction and subsequently increased chemoresistance. Although we showed that knockdown of Sp1 could
decrease the chemosensitivity of breast cancer T47D cells to
MS275, Adriamycin, or their combination (Fig. 6C), the effect of
Sp1 knockdown on decreased chemosensitivity in T47D was not
as evident as observed in Sp1-knockout embryonic stem cells
(Fig. 6D). This difference may be due to the level of Sp1 protein.
Because Sp1 is highly expressed in T47D cells, siRNA silencing
can substantially down-regulate, but not completely eliminate,
Sp1 expression (Fig. 6A). The remaining Sp1 may contribute to
the observed cell death in Sp1 knockdown T47D cells. Consistent
with this, we showed that more surviving cells were observed in
Sp1 / as compared with Sp1+/+ embryonic stem cells presumably because Sp1 was completely eliminated in Sp1 / cells
(Fig. 6D).
It has been shown that protein modifications including
phosphorylation by anticancer agents increase Sp1 transcription
activity (40). Furthermore, Sp1 can be cleaved, and cleaved Sp1
has a higher activity (41). Because treatment of either agent alone
or in combination had no effects on the levels of Sp1 protein,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

we believe that TRAIL expression induced by the treatments may
not be due to the alteration of the level of Sp1 protein. Our
preliminary data indicated that Adriamycin, MS275, or their
combination could cause Sp1 cleavage (data not shown), suggesting that Sp1 cleavage by the treatments may enhance Sp1 activity, leading to increased TRAIL expression, which is under
investigation. In addition, it has been shown that HDAC1 could
interact with Sp1 to regulate its activity (42). Therefore, we tested
the effect of MS275 on Sp1 and HDAC1 interaction by
immunoprecipitation/Western blot. Although HDAC1 activity was
inhibited, MS275 had no effect on the interaction of Sp1 with
HDAC1 (data not shown). Because there are several HDAC family
members, it is possible that MS275 could affect other HDAC
members to regulate Sp1 activity. Regardless, we showed that
MS275 alone or in combination with Adriamycin increased Sp1
transcription activity.
Currently, there are few agents that are truly cancer cell specific
in terms of efficacy and induction of cell death. TRAIL is an
example of a molecule that selectively kills transformed and cancer
cells but not most normal cells (14). Although TRAIL can
selectively kill tumor or transformed cells without harming normal
cells, its regulation in tumors, particularly in solid tumors, is not
fully understood. Previous studies identified several regulatory
elements in TRAIL promoter, which include IFN-stimulated
response element, nuclear factor nB, and Sp1 (18–20). We
previously showed that TRAIL is induced by TNFa and 5-aza2¶-deoxycytidine through distinct mechanisms (33, 34). In this
study, we showed that deletion of the second Sp1 binding site
results in a complete loss of TRAIL promoter activity induced by

TRAIL and Chemosensitization

MS275 alone or in combination with Adriamycin, indicating that
this Sp1 site is required for transactivation of the TRAIL promoter
by our test agents. Furthermore, we have shown by chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays that Sp1 can bind to the TRAIL
promoter on the treatments. Taken together, we conclude that
the second Sp1 site is important for the activation of the TRAIL
promoter.
We have shown that Adriamycin can induce TRAIL at the
protein level but had no effect on the TRAIL promoter activity. We
have also shown that Adriamycin can enhance the TRAIL promoter
activity induced by MS275. This suggests that Adriamycin induces
other factors that may indirectly affect the activity of the TRAIL
promoter. Consistent with this, we have shown by ELISA that there
is a slight increase in TRAIL promoter activity induced by
Adriamycin treatment alone (Fig. 4C).
Defective apoptotic responses are hallmarks of cancer cells, and
apoptotic pathways are therefore attractive therapeutic targets. In
addition to the use of TRAIL and agonistic antibodies alone or in
combination with clinical chemotherapeutic agents, several new

compounds, including HDAC inhibitors that target the apoptotic
pathway, are under development (26, 27). Although HDAC
inhibitors can activate transcription of target genes via histone
acetylation to kill cancer cells by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
(24), recent studies indicated that induction of TRAIL plays a
critical role in leukemia cell death (26, 27). Similarly, we showed
here that HDAC inhibitors induce TRAIL in breast cancer cells
(Fig. 1) and that such induction is critical for T47D and mouse
embryonic stem cell death induced by Adriamycin (Fig. 6C and D).
Thus, our study suggests that induction of endogenous TRAIL
sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy.
In summary, we show that HDAC inhibitors induce TRAIL via
the second Sp1 binding site in the promoter of the TRAIL gene. We
also show that the treatment with MS275 sensitizes breast cancer
cells or mouse embryonic stem cells to Adriamycin-induced death.
More importantly, we show that Sp1-dependent TRAIL induction
plays a critical role in cell death induced by combined treatments
with MS275 and Adriamycin because down-regulation of TRAIL by
siRNA in T47D or deletion of Sp1 in Sp1-knockout mouse
