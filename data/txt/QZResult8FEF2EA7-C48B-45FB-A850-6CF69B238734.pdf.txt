Angiogenesis by a Lysophosphatidic Acid
Antagonist in an Engineered ThreeDimensional Lung Cancer Xenograft Model
Xiaoyu Xu, PhD1 and Glenn D. Prestwich, PhD

BACKGROUND: We developed an engineered three-dimensional (3D) tumor xenograft model of nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) in nude mice, and we used this model to evaluate a dual-activity inhibitor of lysophosphatidic acid
(LPA) biosynthesis and receptor activation. METHODS: First, BrP-LPA, a pan-antagonist for 4 LPA receptors and inhibitor of the lyosphospholipase D activity of autotaxin, was examined for inhibition of cell migration and cell invasion
by human NSCLC A549 cells. Second, A549 cells were encapsulated in 3D in 3 semisynthetic extracellular matrices
(ECMs) based on chemically modified glycosaminoglycans, and injected subcutaneously in nude mice. Tumor volume
and vascularity were determined as a function of semisynthetic ECMs composition. Third, engineered NSCLC xenografts were formed from A549 cells in either Extracel-HP or Matrigel, and mice were treated with 4 intraperitoneal
injections of 3 mg/kg of BrP-LPA. RESULTS: First, BrP-LPA inhibited cell migration and invasiveness of A549 cells in
vitro. Second, tumor growth and microvessel formation for 3D encapsulated A549 cells in vivo in nude mice
increased in the following order: buffer only < Extracel < Extracel-HP < Extracel-HP containing growth factorss plus
laminin. Third, tumor volumes increased rapidly in both Matrigel and Extracel-HP encapsulated A549 cells, and tumor
growth was markedly inhibited by BrP-LPA treatment. Finally, tumor vascularization was dramatically reduced in the
A549 tumors treated with BrP-LPA. CONCLUSIONS: Engineered A549 lung tumors can be created by 3D encapsulation in an ECM substitute with user controlled composition. The engineered tumors regress and lose vascularity

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States,1,2 and among lung cancer patients, >80% have
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgical resection remains the mainstay of therapy for early-stage NSCLC and provides the best opportunity for cure.3 However, many of the patients who present with lung tumors are poor surgical candidates because of limited pulmonary function and severe medical comorbidities.4 Therefore, chemotherapy is the primary
first-line treatment option for the 70%-80% of patients who present with locally advanced or metastatic disease.5
Although many new anti-angiogenic and antimetastatic treatements are in preclinical development, a predictive and reproducible animal model of lung cancer that could reliably translate preclinical results to efficacy in human patients
remains an unmet need. There is general agreement that tumor xenograft models are useful, but are in need of improvement.6-8
Human lung cancer cells do not grow readily in athymic mice, even when a large number of cells (>1  107 cells per
mouse)9,10 and/or immunosuppressive agents are used to obtain tumors.10 Delivery of tumor cells in Matrigel, a threedimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) extracted from murine sarcoma tissue, overcomes some of these shortcomings by providing a growth-enhancing environment that mimics the tumor microenvironment.11 An alternative approach
was the use of Extracel, an in situ-injectable mimic of the ECM developed for 3D cell culture and for tissue engineering,

to produce cell-seeded semisynthetic ECMs (sECMs)
suitable for drug evaluation.12,13 Indeed, this approach of
‘‘tumor engineering’’ succeeded in the following ways: 1)
increased the incidence of cancer formation and reducing
variability in tumor size; 2) enhancing growth of organspecific cancers with good tumor-tissue integration, 3)
improved vascularization and reduced necrosis in the tumor; 4) reduced cancer seeding on adjacent tissues or
organs; and 5) improved the overall health of the animals.14 Low-take ovarian and colon cancer cell lines,
breast cancer cells, and metastatic pancreatic cancer cells
formed vascularized, localized, orthtopic tumors in nude
mice.14,15 Recently, this tumor engineering model has
been validated for evaluation of new anticancer compounds that modify signal transduction pathways essential for tumor cell migration and proliferation.16
The in situ crosslinkable sECM Extracel is fully
chemically defined and nonimmunogenic, and its composition, compliance, and even rate of crosslinking can be
customized for specific cell types for in vitro and in vivo
applications.12 The critical importance of angiogenesis in
growth and metastasis of lung cancers has led to investigation of an increasing number of antiangiogenesis agents
for all types of pulmonary malignancies.17 This angiogenesis is mediated by factors such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF).18 Immobilization of a thiol-modified heparin derivative in the sECM provided a component that mimicked the heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPGs) of native ECMs.19 This HSPG-mimetic sECM
allowed spatiotemporal control of the delivery of single or
dual growth factors (GFs), including bFGF, VEGF,
angiopoetin-1, and KGF,20 and elicited a formation of
mature vasculature in vivo.21-23 Growth factor-loaded
Extracel-HP has also been shown to recruit endogenous
mesenchymal stem cells in vitro.24
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid that
promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and survival
through activation of cell surface G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs).25-27 In particular, the ascites of ovarian cancers is rich in LPA and has been implicated in

1740

growth and invasion of ovarian cancer.28 Recently, LPA
was found to stimulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1-independent VEGF expression to promote tumor angiogenesis through activation of the c-Myc and Sp-1 transcription
factors.29 Moreover, LPA reduced the cellular abundance
of the tumor suppressor p53 in A549 lung carcinoma
cells, which express endogenous LPA receptors.30
Inhibiting the production of LPA is also a relevant
therapeutic target.31,32 The lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity of the tumor-associated protein autotaxin
(ATX) converts lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to
LPA.33,34 ATX, 1 of the 40 most upregulated genes in
invasive cancers, is implicated in cell motility and tumor
invasion, metastasis, and neovascularization35,36 Thus,
simultaneously abrogating signaling through the GPCRs
and attenuating LPA production by ATX suggested dual
activity metabolically stabilized LPA analogs,37,38 such as
those found to reduce breast cancer in orthotopic xenograft models,16 would also have potential as therapeutic
agents for treatment of lung cancer (Fig. 1).
We describe herein the optimization of a new lung
cancer xenograft model using human A549 NSCLC cells
encapsulated in a 3D sECM. First, we modified the composition of the modular sECM by addition of GFs and
laminin peptides to improve tumor growth characteristics. Next, we compared A549 tumors produced in the
optimized Extracel-HP formulation to those generated in
Matrigel to evaluate the ability of BrP-LPA, a dual activity
LPA receptor antagonist and autotaxin inhibitor (Fig. 1)
(Table 1), to induce tumor regression and reduce tumor
vascularization. The sECM model demonstrated that a
biologically relevant context for A549 cells could be customized, with full user control over composition of the
matrix, to evaluate new therapeutic agents for lung cancer
in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crosslinkable sECM Hydrogel
The injectable sECMs tested included Extracel-XX (a 2%
weight/volume [w/v] hydrogel) and Extracel-HP (Glycosan BioSystems, Salt Lake City, Utah). Hydrogels generally formed within 20 minutes after the mixing of the
components according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For this study, Extracel-HP hydrogels were formed by
adding Heprasil into Gelin-S and PEGDA (volume:
volume:volume [v:v:v] ¼ 1:1:0.5). For hydrogels containing GFs, VEGF and bFGF were added into the mixture
before gelation to give final concentrations of 600 ng/mL

VEGF and 600 ng/mL bFGF. For the hydrogel containing the laminin peptide, stock synthetic peptide CGIKVAVGY (‘‘L4’’) was added to the Extracel-XX or
Extracel-HPG before adding the crosslinker PEGDA to
the thiol-modified macromonomer mixture39 to give a
final concentration of 2 mg/mL.
Cells
A549 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, Md). Cells were cultured using the recommended complete medium, F-12K
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 100 U/mL penicillin
(GIBCO), 100 lg/mL streptomycin (GIBCO).
Scratch Wound Assay
A549 cells were plated in triplicate into 6-well plates at a
concentration of 3  105 cells per well. Approximately 48
hours later, the confluent cell layers were carefully
scratched using sterile pipette tips. Nonadherent cells and
cellular debris were removed by washing with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). For the first set of experiments,
fresh medium alone (with 0.5% FBS) or medium with
0.5% FBS containing 10 lM or 40 lM of BrP-LPA16,37
was added into the wounded monolayers. For the second
set of experiments, medium was supplemented with 1 lM
20:0 LPA (Echelon Biosciences, Inc., Salt Lake City,
Utah) or with 1 lM 20:0 LPA plus 10 lM or 40 lM of
BrP-LPA. Cells were observed under the microscope and
digitally photographed at different times. Inhibition of
migration was assessed when the wound in the control
was closed and quantified by using ImageJ.40
Invasion Assay
The invasive behavior of cells was determined in vitro
using 24-well transwell inserts fitted with 8 lm pore-sized
PET membranes, which were coated with 0.368 mg/mL
Matrigel.41 A suspension of cells (100 lL of 5  104 cells/
mL) in serum-free medium with or without 10 lM BrPLPA was added to triplicate inserts, and 600 lL medium
supplemented with serum was used as the chemoattrac-

tant in the lower chamber. After 24 hours, the cells that
did not invade through the pores were removed, and cells
that passed through the filter on the underside of the
membrane were stained with the Diff-Quick Staining Set
(IMEB Inc., San Marcos, Calif) and counted. Ten fields
of cells were counted for each well, and the mean number
of cells per field was calculated. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.
Lung Cancer Xenograft Optimization
Female 4-week-old to 6-week-old nu/nu mice (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass) were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg) as approved by the University of
Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). Before inoculation, A549 cells were trypsinized
and resuspended in different Extracel compositions (Glycosan BioSystems, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah) with a final
concentration of 5  107 cells/mL, and the resulting suspension was mixed gently by vortexing. The following
ECM compositions were examined with 6 mice per
group: Extracel-XX, Extracel-HP alone, and Extracel-HP
containing 600 ng/mL bFGF and 600 ng/mL VEGF as
well as 2 mg/mL of the L4 peptide. For the negative controls, cells were injected in PBS only. For each composition, a 200 lL aliquot of the cell suspension was injected
subcutaneously into 2 injection sites on the dorsum of
each mouse.
Lung Cancer Xenograft Treatment Models
Treatment with BrP-LPA, synthesized and provided by
Dr. Honglu Zhang (University of Utah), was performed
as previously described16 with modifications. The mice
were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups and 2
control groups (6 mice per group). In the first controlled
experiment, a suspension of A549 cells in Extracel-HP
with added L-4 (2 mg/mL) but without GFs (5  107
cells/mL) was prepared, and before gelation, a 200 lL aliquot was injected subcutaneously into the dorsum of each
of the 12 mice in the control and treatment groups. In the
second controlled experiment, a suspension of A549 cells

1741

Original Article

was prepared in Matrigel (5  107 cells/mL) at 4 C, and a
200 lL aliquot was injected subcutaneously into the dorsum of each of the 12 mice in the control and treatment
groups. For all groups, tumors were allowed to form for
2.5 weeks. Then, each treatment group received intraperitoneal injections of BrP-LPA (3 mg/kg) twice per week
for 2 weeks; the control groups were injected intraperitoneally with physiological saline.
The tumor sizes were measured with digital calipers
and calculated as follows: tumor size (mm3) ¼ [width
(mm)]2  [length (mm)]2. The antitumor effects of the
treatment were evaluated in terms of the lowest T/C values (%), where T is the relative mean tumor size of the
treatment group, and C is the relative mean tumor size of
the control group at any given time. The animals’ body
weights were measured at the time of tumor measurement
to monitor for any drug toxicity. Mice were sacrificed after 7 weeks, and the tumor tissues were removed for histology and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining
and immunohistochemistry using an anti-CD31 antibody
as previously described.16
Statistical Methods
Data from in vitro and in vivo experiments were processed
to express as the mean  standard deviation (SD) of at
least triplicate determinations. Statistical comparisons
were performed by Student t test, and differences were
considered significant at P < .05.

RESULTS
In vitro Inhibition of Cell Migration
The effects of BrP-LPA without or with LPA stimulation
on the cell migration of A549 lung cancer cells were tested
using a scratch wound assay (Fig. 2). A549 lung carcinoma
cells express endogenous LPA receptors LPA1-3,30 and LPA1
is the most important GPCR-mediating cell migration of
normal and neoplastic cells.42 In the first set of experiments,
after treatment with different concentrations of BrP-LPA,
cells were allowed to migrate into the denuded area for 0, 8,
and 16 hours. By 16 hours, untreated control cells completely filled the scratched area, while the migration of A549
cells was significantly decreased (P < .05) by 40 lM BrPLPA when compared with untreated cells. In a second set of
experiments, cell migration was stimulation with 1 lM
arachidoyl (20:0) LPA, and the ability of BrP-LPA to antagonize this activation was examined. Importantly, even under
these stringent conditions, 40 lM BrP-LPA significantly
decrease cell migration compared with the LPA-stimulated

1742

cells. Inhibition of cell migration at both time points suggests that these effects are not because of inhibition cell of
proliferation (Fig. 2).
In vitro invasion assay

To examine the ability of BrP-LPA to inhibit the invasiveness of A549 cells, an in vitro invasion assay using a
modified Boyden chamber was employed. A549 lung cancer cells showed prominent invasion through Matrigelcoated transwell membranes (Fig. 3a). Treatment with BrPLPA inhibited the invasion (P < .05) for A549 cells (Fig.
3b), suggesting that BrP-LPA has the potential to reduce the
metastatic potential of lung cancer cells in vivo.
Lung Cancer Xenograft Optimization
Subcutaneous injection of A549 cells suspended in PBS
only, Extracel-XX, Extracel-HP, and Extracel-HP plus
GFs and L4 into nu/nu mice resulted in tumor growth at
all sites of injection (Fig. 4). As anticipated, the slowest
rate of tumor growth occurred in the buffer-only injected
cells, while cells in the 2% w/v Extracel-XX, in analogy to
the previous tumor engineering studies with breast, ovarian, and colon cancer, generated significantly larger
tumors 769  251 mm3 over the 7-week time course.
Even without added GFs, Extracel-HP alone provided
better tumor growth environment than Extracel-XX,
reaching 949  148 mm3. This demonstrates that the
addition of the HSPG-mimetic crosslinkable heparin
component alone could improve tumor growth. The
addition of the VEGF þ bFGF combination, and the
covalent addition of the IKVAV-containing laminin peptide appeared to provide only a modest improvement
(1012  322 mm3) over the simpler Extracel-HP.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining allowed visualization of the cellular organization within the tumor mass,
and revealed that the tumors mainly comprised carcinoma
cells in the untreated groups with blood vessels. Immunohistochemistry using anti-CD31 antibodies identified the
microvascular pattern within the NSCLC tumors (Fig.
5a). Further calculation of the microvessels density
(MVD) was performed when stained CD31 immunohistochemical tests were obtained. The results indicated that
sECMs with immobilized heparin modulated GF release
and promoted the development of functional microvessel
network (Fig. 5b).

be used in place of the commonly used Engelbreth-HolmSwarm mouse sarcoma-derived Matrigel for 3D encapsulation for rapid growth of vascularized tumor tissue. The
analytical data accompanying Matrigel indicate that the
predominant GFs present include TGF-b, EGF, IGF,
bFGF, and PDGF. Second, we tested whether the engineered tumors in each ECM substitute would be susceptible to treatment with BrP-LPA, which had been shown to
cause breast tumor regression in an engineered orthotopic
xenograft model.16
Subcutaneous injection of A549 cells suspended in
either Extracel-HP (Fig.6) or Matrigel (Fig. 7) formed
tumors in vivo, which in the untreated control group after
7 weeks, grew to 864  211 mm3 in Extracel-HP and
1058  427 mm3 in Matrigel. It is not surprising that
A549 cells suspended in Extracel-HP þ L4 (Fig. 6a) had a
slightly lower growth rate than cells encapsulated in
Matrigel (Fig. 7a), because the tumor-derived Matrigel
has the full spectrum of sarcoma-derived GFs and other
basement membrane components, which provide cancer
cells with a naturally favorable microenvironment. What
is remarkable is how small the difference is. With only a
minimal laminin peptide, without GFs, and without a
myriad of tumor ECM factors, a simple crosslinked
hydrogel that comprised a network of chemically modified HA, gelatin, and heparin recapitulated the majority
of the cues provided by the tumor microenvironment.
Moreover, Extracel was readily handled at room temperature rather than at 4 C.
After 2 weeks of tumor growth, mice in the treatment groups received intraperitoneal injections of BrPLPA (3 mg/kg), twice per week for 2 weeks. The dose was

selected on the basis of the previous dose of this pure antidiastereoisomer of BrP-LPA that was found to be effective
in reducting tumor volume and vascularity in an orthotopic breast cancer model.16 In both the Extracel (Fig. 6a)
and Matrigel (Fig. 7a) groups, a significant reduction of
tumor size was observed by the end of the first week of
treatment when compared with the respective control
groups. During treatment, estimated tumor mass did not
exceed 10% of body weight, and the exposure to BrP-LPA
for 7 weeks did not reduce the body weight significantly
(data not shown), indicating that the compound was well
tolerated with minimal off-target toxicity. We had previously observed a similar lack of general toxicity in a 10 mg/
kg dose of the mixed diastereoisomers of BrP-LPA.16
After completion of the 2-week treatment course,
tumor sizes in both treatment groups were significantly
decreased (Fig. 6a, Fig. 7a). More importantly, tumors
continued to regress for an additional 3 weeks after the
final BrP-LPA injection in both the Matrigel and the
Extracel-HP matrices. The figures show statistically significant differences at each time point, from midway
through the drug doses through to the end of the
experiment.
At 7 weeks, animals were sacrificed, and the tumors
were surgically removed and prepared for histology analysis. The tumor samples in the BrP-LPA treatment groups
were significantly smaller than the tumor tissues in the
control group (Fig. 6b, Fig. 7b). Hematoxylin and eosin
staining revealed an irregular arrangement of tumor cells

DISCUSSION
We tested 2 hypotheses using engineered NSCLC
tumor xenografts. First, we asked whether a simple,
modular sECM such as Extracel could be used in
place of the mouse sarcoma-derived Matrigel to
support rapid growth of vascularized tumors. Second, we examined how engineered tumors in each
ECM substitute would respond to systemic treatment with BrP-LPA, an LPA antagonist/ATX inhibitor that had been shown to cause breast tumor
regression in an engineered orthotopic xenograft
model.16 These 2 issues are discussed separately
below.

1746

Improved Xenograft Models
Current animal models of lung cancer have low rates of tumor growth and metastasis.43 Growing human lung cancer
cells in athymic mice has been problematic,9,10 even when
immunosuppressive agents and a high density of tumor cells
are used to obtain tumors.10 In the basement membrane,
metastatic lung tumor cells attach preferentially to laminin.44,45 Laminin stimulates tumor cell adhesion,46 collagenase IV production,47 cell motility,48,49 and the formation
of metastasis.45 One potential opportunity to improve xenograft quality would, thus, be to include laminin or a laminin-derived peptide to increase the tumorigenicity of 3D
encapsulated lung cancer cells in vivo.

Cell-matrix interactions in 3D are an essential part
of the microenvironment of all cells, including tumor
cells.50 The tumor-derived ECM product Matrigel has
seen widespread use in distinguishing gene expression and
phenotypic differences in cells growth in 3D51 modeling
tissue-specific signaling and organ function in 3D,52 and
in modeling glandular epithelial cancers in 3D cultures.53
The use of Matrigel as a 3D cell delivery system rich in tumor-derived GFs greatly increases the incidence of cancer
formation in vivo.54-56 Despite these advantages, there are
procedural disadvantages in the use of Matrigel. For
example, the syringe and needle need to be precooled at
80 C, and all procedures—from re-suspending cells to
preparing the cells for injection—need to be carried out at

Cancer

4 C in a very short time to avoid premature gelation and,
thus, clogging of the needle. These problems are exacerbated during orthotopic injections in surgical models,
resulting in increased experimental variability and failed
injections. In addition, batch-to-batch variability and lack
of user control of the composition of the 3D matrix further complicate the use of Matrigel. The sECM Extracel
addresses many of these drawbacks, offering a room temperature-injectable 3D hydrogel vehicle for cell delivery.12,14 Moreover, in the absence of GFs, the
proangiogenic effects of the oligosaccharide degradation
products of HA have been implicated in the growth of
non-necrotic, vascularized tissues from normal13 and tumor-derived cells.14

To identify a sECM based on Extracel that would be
optimal for NSCLC cells, we investigated the encapsulation of A549 cells in 3 different Extracel compositions.
Because epithelial cells on stiffer substrates have higher
moduli and exhibit a more stretched and organized actin
cytoskeleton than those on softer substrates,57 we examined the 2% (w/v) hydrogel Extracel-XX, which is stiffer
than the 1% (w/v) hydrogel Extracel-X. We also tested
Extracel-HP, an sECM that contains an immobilized derivative of heparin, thereby mimicking an HSPG-like
microenvironment for presentation and sequestration of
basic GFs. Finally, we noted that metastatic tumor cells
attach preferentially to laminin, the predominant glycoprotein in basement membranes.44,45 Laminin stimulates
tumor cell adhesion, collagenase IV production, cell motility, and the formation of metastasis. The final composition tested was a modification of Extracel-HP containing
a covalently linked IKVAV peptide58 plus VEGF and
bFGF GFs. Surprisingly, the addition of the GFs and the
laminin peptide showed only a modest improvement over
just Extracel-HP itself in terms of neovascularization and
microvessel formation in the engineered lung cancer xenograft tumors.

Therapeutic Potential of ATX Inhibitors and
LPA Antagonists
LPA GPCRs and ATX present 2 promising, druggable,
yet under-exploited targets for cancer therapy.30,31,59
ATX, a potent motogen in metastatic cancers,35 produces
a continuous output of LPA,33,34 potentially abrogating
the action of an LPA antagonist. By blocking ATX, the
autocrine/paracrine loop that involves the ATX-mediated
production of LPA is reduced.32,59 Although ATX is
product feedback inhibited,60 using LPA to inhibit ATX
would be counterproductive. Thus, analogues of LPA that
retained ATX inhibitory activity yet did not activate LPA
GPCRs are needed. BrP-LPA is a potent pan-LPA GPCR
antagonist and ATX inhibitor,16 inhibits cell migration,
invasion, and proliferation, and, thus, has clear therapeutic potential.61 In contrast, analogues of cyclophosphatidic acid (ccPA) were selective inhibitors of ATX but
lacked agonist activity for LPA1,2,3.61 These ccPA analogues inhibited cancer cell invasion in vitro and suppressed metastasis of melanoma cells in vivo. Reduction
of melanoma cell migration in vitro was also demonstrated for several small molecule ATX inhibitors.62 However, ATX inhibition alone is insufficient because it is
necessary to suppress receptor activation by endogenous

LPA as well as reduce LPA production production for
maximal therapeutic efficacy.
Conclusions
We have described a useful and new engineered lung cancer xenograft model using human A549 NSCLC cells
encapsulated in Extracel, a 3D crosslinked network of
chemically modified gelatin and glycosaminoglycans. The
addition of the GFs VEGF and bFGF and the addition of
a laminin peptide only modestly improved tumor growth.
Growth of A549 NSCLC tumor xenografts in ExtracelHP in vivo were compared with NSCLC xenografts in
Matrigel, and the models were used to evaluate the ability
of BrP-LPA, a dual activity LPA receptor antagonist and
autotaxin inhibitor, to induce tumor regression and
reduce tumor vascularization. The sECM model demonstrated that Extracel-HP provides a useful new material
for A549 xenografts, and allows for complete experimental control over composition of the matrix during the in
vivo evaluation of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of lung cancer.
