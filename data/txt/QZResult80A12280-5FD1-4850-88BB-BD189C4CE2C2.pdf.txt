ABSTRACT
Background: To examine the angiopoietin pathway inhibitor trebananib IV plus
the anti-VEGF agents bevacizumab or motesanib in advanced solid tumours.
Methods: In this open-label phase 1b study, patients received IV trebananib
3 mg kg−1 QW plus bevacizumab 15 mg kg−1 Q3W (cohort 1) or motesanib orally
75 mg (cohort 2); or trebananib 10 mg kg−1 plus bevacizumab 15 mg kg−1 (cohort 3) or
motesanib 125 mg (cohort 4). If <33% of patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs),
dose escalation occurred. Endpoints were treatment–related adverse events (AEs)
incidence and pharmacokinetics (primary); anti-trebananib antibodies, biomarkers,
and tumour response (secondary).
Results: Thirty-six patients received ≥1 dose of trebananib (cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4;
n = 6, 8, 19, 3). DLT of G3 intestinal perforation and G3 tumor haemorrhage occurred
in cohorts 2 and 3, respectively (both n = 1). Across both trebananib plus bevacizumab
cohorts, the most common AEs included fatigue (n = 8), diarrhoea (n =4), constipation
(n = 3), nausea (n = 3), and epistaxis (n = 3). Three patients across those cohorts
had grade ≥3 AEs. Across the trebananib plus motesanib cohorts, the most common
AEs included hypertension (n = 4), diarrhoea (n = 4), nausea (n = 3), fatigue
(n = 3), vomiting (n = 2), and decreased appetite (n = 2). Two patients had grade
≥3 AEs. Trebananib did not markedly affect motesanib pharmacokinetics. Across the
trebananib plus bevacizumab cohorts, two patients had a partial response; 11 patients
had stable disease lasting >6 months. Across the trebananib plus motesanib cohorts,
one patient had a partial response; five patients had stable disease lasting >6 months.

Conclusion: Trebananib IV 3 mg kg−1 or 10 mg kg−1 plus bevacizumab or
motesanib in advanced solid tumours may be associated with less severe toxicities
relative to those emerging when combining two anti-VEGF agents.

monotherapy included peripheral oedema and fatigue; no
bleeding or thromboembolic events occurred. A randomised
phase 2 study in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
suggested that treatment with trebananib at 3 mg kg−1 or
10 mg kg−1 QW plus paclitaxel QW may result in improved
progression-free survival (PFS) relative to placebo plus
paclitaxel QW, particularly at the higher dose [17]. Again,
the toxicity profile was distinct and generally manageable.
The current study’s objectives were to assess the
tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and biomarker profiles,
and tumour response to trebananib in combination
with two VEGF pathway inhibitors, the humanised
recombinant monoclonal antibody bevacizumab
or small molecule antagonist motesanib, in adult
patients with advanced solid tumours. Bevacizumab
inhibits VEGF with demonstrated antitumor activity
in combination with multiple chemotherapies in
several cancers such as colorectal and non–small cell
lung cancer [18, 19]. Motesanib blocks the VEGF
receptors (VEGFRs)-1, -2, and -3, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-Kit [20].
In previous studies, motesanib treatment reduced
tumour burden when administered as monotherapy or in
combination with chemotherapy [21–23].

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis, the process of formation of new blood
vessels from the pre-existing vasculature, is critically
important in tumour development and metastasis [1].
Relatively recent approaches in advancing antiangiogenic
therapies for cancer have involved simultaneous inhibition
of multiple angiogenic targets in an effort to achieve
superior efficacy relative to inhibition of single targets. To
date, these attempts have been limited to the combination
of anti-VEGF pathway-targeted therapies. While there
appears to be some suggestion of enhanced efficacy,
increased toxicities were also observed, likely as a result
of additive, synergistic, or antagonistic stimulation of the
VEGF pathway [2]. Moreover, combination treatments
targeting the same pathway carry the risk of initiating
compensatory escape mechanisms [3–5]. Preclinical
research suggests that the combination of an angiopoietin
inhibitor and an anti–VEGF antibody may enhance
antitumor activity [6]. It is unknown, however, whether
such combination therapies would provide an improved
risk/benefit ratio in the clinical setting.
The angiopoietin pathway is a key regulator of
angiogenesis [7, 8]. It involves the receptor tyrosine
kinase, Tie2, which is expressed in a limited number of
cell types, including the vascular endothelium [9]. Tie2
binds the ligands Ang1, Ang2, and Ang4, with Ang1 and
Ang2 being well characterised. While Ang1 appears to
contribute to vessel maturation and stabilisation [10],
Ang2 plays a crucial role in vessel destabilisation during
vascular remodelling [11] and new vessel sprouting [9].
Thus, both represent important and complementary
determinants of angiogenesis. Elevated Ang2 expression
has been found in tumour vasculature across various
cancer types and has been associated with disease
progression [11–13] and worse prognosis [14].
Trebananib, an investigational, intravenously
administered peptide-Fc fusion protein (“peptibody”),
inhibits tumour angiogenesis through dual inhibition of
Ang1 and Ang2, thereby neutralising their interaction with
the Tie2 receptor. Animal models have demonstrated tumour
inhibition when trebananib is administered systematically to
tumour-bearing mice [11]. Importantly, the antitumor effect
has been shown to be greater with combined inhibition of
Ang1 and Ang2 compared with blocking of either ligand in
isolation [15]. Results from a first-in-human dose escalation
study in patients with advanced solid tumours showed that
trebananib monotherapy had antitumor activity and was
tolerated at doses up to 30 mg kg−1 once weekly (QW) with
a toxicity profile that was distinct from other angiogenesis
inhibitors, including VEGF pathway inhibitors [16]. The

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 38 patients were enrolled between
December 2005 and February 2007: cohort 1 (trebananib
3 mg kg−1 plus bevacizumab 15 mg kg−1), n = 6); cohort
2 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1 plus motesanib 75 mg), n = 9;
cohort 3 (trebananib 10 mg kg−1 plus bevacizumab
15 mg kg−1) n = 20; and cohort 4 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1
plus motesanib 125 mg) n = 3. One patient each in cohorts
2 and 3 did not receive trebananib treatment and, therefore,
was excluded from all subsequent analyses. Patients
discontinued the study for the following reasons: disease
progression (cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4; n = 2, 3, 13, 2), death
(n = 1, 3, 2, 0), withdrawal of consent (n = 0, 1, 1, 0),
adverse events (n =  1, 0, 0, 0), and other (n = 2, 2, 4, 1).
Across cohorts 1 through 4, patients received
a median of 18.5, 9.5, 15.0, and 11.0 weekly doses
of trebananib, respectively. Cohorts 1 and 3 were
administered a median number of 7.0 and 6.0 doses of
bevacizumab, respectively. Cohorts 2 and 4 were given a
median number of 66.5 and 87.0 doses of daily motesanib,
respectively. Demographic and baseline characteristics
are depicted in Table 1. Patients’ duration of study
participation is provided in Figure 1 of the Supplemental
Data section.

with bevacizumab. (B) mean (+ SD) plasma concentration-time profiles of motesanib after 75 or 125 mg oral QD dosing of motesanib in

Tolerability

3 mg kg−1 plus motesanib 125 mg). Five patients in cohort
3 received fewer than three doses of trebananib as the
result of a DLT (n = 1) and disease progression (n = 4);
thus, the cohort was expanded to include an additional
three patients. Investigators opted to add 10 more patients
to cohort 3 for a final cohort enrolment of 19 patients.
This report presents treatment-related adverse events
that were considered to be possibly related to any of the
administered study agents per the clinical investigator’s
assessment. No cohort-specific trends in the incidence of
treatment-related adverse events across treatment groups
were noted. Across the dose cohorts of trebananib plus
bevacizumab (cohorts 1 and 3, n = 25), the most common
treatment-related adverse events included fatigue,
diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, and epistaxis (Table 2).
Three patients (12%) had grade ≥3 treatment-related
adverse events, including arterial haemorrhage (grade
5; n = 1) in a patient with squamous cell head and neck

No DLTs occurred in cohort 1 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1
plus bevacizumab 15 mg kg−1). Nonetheless, after one
of the initial three enrolled patients died from arterial
haemorrhage at week 10, the decision was made to
expand the current cohort to six patients before initiating
enrolment into the higher dose cohort (cohort 3). One
patient in cohort 2 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1 plus motesanib
75 mg) had a DLT of intestinal perforation; therefore,
cohort 2 was also expanded to include six patients.
Two patients in cohort 2 did not receive trebananib and
motesanib simultaneously during the first study month
on days when both therapies were administered; thus,
two new patients were added for a total of eight patients.
In cohort 3 (trebananib 10 mg kg−1 plus bevacizumab
15 mg kg−1), one patient had a DLT of tumour
haemorrhage. No DLTs occurred in cohort 4 (trebananib

cancer in cohort 1, tumour haemorrhage (grade 5; n = 1)
in a patient with squamous cell head and neck cancer, and
fatigue (grade 3; n = 1) in a patient with breast cancer
in cohort 3. No grade 4 treatment-related adverse events
occurred in cohorts 1 or 3. In addition to the patients with
arterial haemorrhage and tumour haemorrhage in cohorts
1 and 3, respectively, two patients in cohort 3 died from
disease progression (n = 1) and respiratory failure (n = 1).
Those two deaths were not considered to be related to the
study treatment.
Across the dose cohorts of trebananib plus
motesanib (cohorts 2 and 4, n = 11), the most common
treatment-related adverse events included hypertension,
diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and decreased
appetite (Table 3). Two patients (18%) had grade ≥ 3
treatment-related adverse events; those events were all
grade 3 and included hypertension (n = 1) in a patient
with ovarian cancer, and leukoencephalopathy (n = 1)
(the patient with leukoencephalopathy was not on
antihypertensive medication previously) and intestinal
perforation (n = 1) in a patient with ureteral cancer; the
events of hypertension and leukoencephalopathy were
not considered to be related to trebananib treatment. No
grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred. Two
patients died from renal failure (n = 1) and respiratory
failure (n = 1), which was not considered to be treatmentrelated.

Therefore, it was concluded that the samples did not have
neutralising antibodies. No patient developed neutralising
antibodies during the study period.

Biomarkers
Changes in biomarker levels during treatment
relative to baseline were statistically significant for two of
the five tested analytes. There was a nominally significant
increase in serum levels of PLGF in each cohort, except
in cohort 4 (P-values ranged from 0.03 to 0.12 across
timepoints; Supplemental Data, Figure 2A), which may
be related to the limited number of available patient
data (n = 3) for that cohort. Increases in serum levels of
sVCAM-1 during treatment compared with baseline were
statistically significant in each cohort (Supplemental Data,
Figure 2B). Closer examination reveals a steplike pattern
with an initial increase of sVCAM-1 levels on treatment
day 4 followed by another elevation on day 9. In cohort
2, sVCAM-1 returned to pretreatment levels on day 50.
sKit was significantly (P < 0.01) elevated in cohort 3
on days 2 and 4. The remaining analytes remained largely
unchanged over time for any of the treatment cohorts
(data not shown). VEGF levels for either dose cohort of
trebananib plus bevacizumab could not be detected as the
result of assay interference from bevacizumab. There were
no correlations between any of the biomarkers and tumour
response (data not shown).

Pharmacokinetics

Tumour response

The mean (+SD) serum concentration-time
profiles of trebananib at steady state at week 4 following
weekly IV infusions of trebananib in combination with
bevacizumab or motesanib are shown in Figure 1A. Values
for PK parameters of trebananib in this study are listed in
Table 4 and are similar to those reported for trebananib
monotherapy in a phase 1 study [16], consistent with a
lack of effect of bevacizumab or motesanib on trebananib
PK. Only limited data (n = 3) was available for cohort 4.
The mean plasma concentration profiles of motesanib at
75 mg or 125 mg when coadministered with trebananib
3 mg kg−1 were similar to their profiles observed without
the addition of trebananib (Table 4; Figure 1B).

All patients who received ≥1 dose of trebananib
(n = 36) were initially considered for tumour response
assessment. Tumour response by RECIST 1.0 [24] was
available for 26 patients (Figure 2).
In the trebananib plus bevacizumab arms (cohorts 1
and 3), 25 patients received ≥1 dose of trebananib.
Of these, 18 patients had response measurements by
RECIST. Postbaseline tumour response assessments were
not conducted for seven patients due to rapid clinical
progression (n = 4), death (n = 1), and incorrect imaging
(n = 2). Across cohorts 1 and 3, no patient achieved a
complete response; two patients had a confirmed partial
response. One of the patients with a partial response was
in cohort 1 and had prostate cancer (duration of response,
16.3 weeks); the other patient was in cohort 3 and had
breast cancer (duration of response, 68.1 weeks; this
patient did not develop progressive disease by the data
analysis cutoff date). The median percent change in
tumour size was −1.23% across cohorts 1 and 3. Eleven
patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria as their
best response. Five patients with prostate (n = 2), thyroid
(n = 1), breast (n = 1), and pancreatic cancer (n = 1) had
stable disease >6 months (range: 28.6–84.1 weeks) while
receiving study treatment.
In the trebananib plus motesanib arms (cohorts
2 and 4), 11 patients were evaluable. Eight patients

Immunogenicity
Serum samples for anti-trebananib antibody analyses
were available for all 36 patients. In both cohorts 1 and 3
(trebananib plus bevacizumab), one patient each developed
binding antibodies during study treatment. Both patients
continued to test positive for binding antibodies at the
end of the study. One patient in cohort 2 was transiently
positive for binding antibodies. No binding antibodies
were detected in cohort 4. The baseline samples for one
patient in cohort 1 and two patients in cohort 2 neutralised
the trebananib activities in the neutralising activity assay,
but did not demonstrate positivity in the immunoassay.

tumour responses could not be evaluated for three
patients as the result of withdrawal of consent (n = 2) and
clinical progression (n = 1). One patient with testicular
cancer achieved a confirmed partial response that lasted
85.0 weeks (Supplemental Data, Figures 3A & B); the
patient remained on the study for 116 weeks. The median
percent change in tumour size was −15.06% across cohorts
2 and 4. Five patients with ovarian (n = 3), adrenal cortical
(n  = 1), and uterine cancer (n = 1) had stable disease by
RECIST criteria, with the response of one patient with
ovarian cancer lasting >6 months (41.0 weeks).

study. The most common treatment-related adverse events
seen with the trebananib plus bevacizumab combination
included fatigue (32%), diarrhoea (16%), constipation
(12%), nausea (12%), and epistaxis (12%). Of the
25 patients who received the combination, 12% had grade
≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events. There appeared to
be no noticeable increase in hypertension, proteinuria, or
intestinal perforation beyond what would be expected with
bevacizumab alone.
Both trebananib [17] and bevacizumab [34]
are likely active as single agents in combination with
chemotherapy and, therefore, their combination has a
potential risk of increasing the frequency or severity of
toxicities that are typically observed during trebananib or
bevacizumab monotherapy, such as peripheral oedema for
trebananib [16] or intestinal perforation for bevacizumab
[35]. All four patients with ovarian cancer who were
enrolled in our study received trebananib plus motesanib
and did not experience any signs of intestinal perforation,
with three of the four patients having some level of
minor response. Although we did not enrol any patients
with ovarian cancer in the trebananib plus bevacizumab
arms, the lack of intestinal perforation in the patients with
ovarian cancer in the trebananib plus motesanib arms
may suggest that combining trebananib and bevacizumab
does not have a high incidence of intestinal perforation
in a population with ovarian cancer. In addition, Karlan
et al [17] showed recently that treatment with trebananib
in combination with paclitaxel was not associated with
a higher incidence of intestinal perforations in patients
with recurrent ovarian cancer relative to a placebo group.
This finding suggests that a combination of trebananib
and bevacizumab may be feasible without significantly
increasing the intestinal perforation rate over bevacizumab
alone. A dose-response effect was also reported in the
study by Karlan and colleagues, with improvement of
PFS at trebananib 10 mg kg−1 (PFS, 2.6 months) versus
trebananib 3 mg kg−1 (PFS, 1.1 months). In our study, we
showed that trebananib plus bevacizumab was tolerable
at doses up to 10 mg kg−1 for trebananib and 15 mg kg−1
for bevacizumab. Higher doses may be achievable with
trebananib at 15 mg kg−1 and bevacizumab at 15 mg kg−1
given the lack of synergistic toxicities seen at the current
tested dose levels.
The most common treatment-related adverse events
associated with the trebananib and motesanib combination
included hypertension (36%), diarrhoea (36%), nausea
(27%), fatigue (27%), vomiting (18%), and decreased
appetite (18%). These findings are similar to the adverse
events seen with motesanib alone. The common toxicities
previously associated with trebananib monotherapy, such
as peripheral oedema, were not seen in this combination
and may be reflective of the lower dose of trebananib at
3 mg kg−1 administered in the motesanib combination
cohorts. The lack of haematologic adverse events that are
typically observed with other combinations of VEGFR

DISCUSSION
The current study of trebananib administered
intravenously QW in combination with bevacizumab
or motesanib in patients with advanced cancer with
considerable pre-treatment (69% of patients had received
≥3 lines of prior chemotherapy), shows that with both
combinations, a true maximum tolerated dose was not
achieved. Overall, the adverse events were similar to
those toxicities described for trebananib, bevacizumab,
and motesanib alone [16, 21, 22, 28]. Previous studies
have demonstrated that the combination of two VEGF
pathway inhibitors is generally not well tolerated in
patients with cancer [29, 30]. In this study, it appeared
that a less severe toxicity profile was associated with the
combination of trebananib plus bevacizumab or motesanib
when compared with toxicity profiles typically associated
with treatments combining two VEGF pathway inhibitors.
One DLT occurred in cohort 3 when trebananib
was combined with bevacizumab, and two deaths were
thought to be at least possibly related to both trebananib
and bevacizumab treatment per the clinical investigator’s
assessment. Those deaths occurred in head and neck cancer
patients with squamous cell pathology and extensive
disease to the lung and neck. One of those two patients
developed severe neck pain and a new mass on the left
neck 5 days after the first study drug dosing; 4 days later,
the patient died with haemorrhage from the mouth. The
second patient developed a massive haemorrhage from the
mouth and nose and died after eight doses of trebananib
and three doses of bevacizumab. In both instances,
patients had tumours with squamous cell pathology, which
at the start of the study was not an exclusion criterion for
the treatment combination. Extensive experience with
bevacizumab has shown that patients with squamous cell
lung cancer are at high risk for tumour bleeding (31%)
with fatal or serious bleeding events [31], which has led
to a warning against using bevacizumab in squamous cell
lung cancer [32]. Similarly, a study with bevacizumab
and pemetrexed in recurrent or metastatic squamous
cell head and neck cancer showed a high rate (15%) of
grade 3 to 5 bleeding events [33]. It is unclear as to how
much trebananib contributed to the deaths in the current

tyrosine kinase inhibitors and VEGFR axis antibodies,
such as bevacizumab plus sorafenib [2] or bevacizumab
plus sunitinib [36], was encouraging. Patients received
trebananib a median of 9.5 and 11.0 weeks in cohorts 2
and 4, respectively; motesanib was administered a median
of 67 and 87 days in those corresponding cohorts. One
limitation of the design of this trial with a standard 3+3
design was the short DLT window (28 days), which did
not adequately assess for long–term ongoing toxicities
such as grade 2 nausea.
Although assessment of efficacy was not a primary
objective of the study, the combinations showed some
interesting clinical activity. In cohort 3, a prostate cancer
patient with significant lung and bone metastases had a
partial response despite an increase in this patient’s prostate–
specific antigen (data not shown). A second patient with
breast cancer in cohort 3 had a partial response lasting 68
weeks. In addition, a patient with testicular cancer in cohort
2 showed a partial response lasting 85 weeks. Finally, six
patients had stable disease lasting >6 months while on study;
they were two patients with prostate cancer, and one patient
each with ovarian, thyroid, breast, or pancreatic cancer.
The PK of motesanib did not appear to be affected
when administered in combination with trebananib. In
addition, trebananib concentration-time profiles in this
study were comparable to those of the monotherapy trial
[16], suggesting that trebananib PK was not affected by
the coadministration of bevacizumab or motesanib. The
presence of the binding anti-drug antibodies did not appear
to affect the PK of trebananib.
We explored five potential biomarkers of
angiogenesis to measure the biological activity of
the trebananib combinations. Only serum PLGF and
sVCAM-1 showed significant increases in each cohort. In
a combination study of trebananib with chemotherapy, a
rise in PLGF and sVCAM-1 concentrations in each cohort
(trebananib plus FOLFOX-4, carboplatin/paclitaxel, or
docetaxel) was also observed [37]. Other antiangiogenic
agents, such as sunitinib [38, 39], bevacizumab [40], and
motesanib [21], have shown increases in PLGF, which may
reflect a compensatory mechanism (ie, increase in upstream
proangiogenic signalling) when blocking downstream
pathways. Based on our data, there is not a significant
difference in changes in PLGF and sVCAM-1 between the
high and low dose levels of trebananib, except during week
50 for sVCAM-1. However, the number of samples in our
study was small, and a larger cohort is needed to come to a
definitive conclusion whether trebananib dose levels affect
PLGF or sVCAM-1 changes during treatment.
In conclusion, the combination of VEGF pathway
inhibitors in the treatment of cancer has been previously
associated with high toxicity. In this study, results suggest
that the combinations of trebananib, an angiopoietin
pathway inhibitor, with the anti-VEGF agents
bevacizumab or motesanib in patients with advanced solid
tumours may be associated with a less severe toxicity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

profile when compared with combination treatments
targeting only the VEGF pathway. Furthermore, the
combinations tested in the present study did not appear
to exacerbate toxicities that are typically observed when
these treatments are administered as monotherapies.
Although the trial did not show clear evidence of
synergistic activity, the treatment combinations were
associated with antitumour activity across a broad range
of tumour types. The data support larger studies of
trebananib in combination with VEGF pathway inhibitors.
Various phase 2 clinical trials have been conducted,
including studies of trebananib with sorafenib in patients
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.
gov NCT00872014), trebananib with sunitinib [41] or
sorafenib [42] in patients with renal cell cancer, and
trebananib with bevacizumab in patients with breast
cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00511459).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Key eligibility criteria included age ≥18 years; a
diagnosis of advanced solid tumors refractory to standard
treatment; measurable or evaluable (nonmeasurable)
disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) guidelines (v.1.0) [24]; an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2; and
adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function.
Excluded were patients with a prior bleeding diathesis,
gastrointestinal surgery or disease, thrombosis or
pulmonary embolism or cardiovascular events during the
past year; a diagnosis of ovarian cancer while receiving
bevacizumab; a diagnosis of lung cancer with tumor
lesions ≥3 cm; or chronic uncontrolled hypertension,
chronic hepatitis, or symptomatic or untreated central
nervous system metastases; a treatment history with
angiopoietin or VEGF inhibitors or radiation therapy
to the abdomen; recent treatment with anticancer or
palliative radiation; or current treatment regimens
containing strong CYP 3A inhibitors, immune modulators,
St. John’s wort, or coumarin anticoagulants ≥2 mg/day.
Because two patients with squamous cell head and neck
cancer developed grade 5 hemorrhage, the protocol was
amended to exclude patients with head and neck cancer or
lung squamous cell tumors. All patients provided written
informed consent. An institutional review board of each
study center approved all study procedures.

Study design and treatment
This open-label, dose escalation phase 1b study was
carried out at five centres in the United States and examined
trebananib in combination with bevacizumab, motesanib,
sorafenib, or sunitinib (Supplemental Data, Figure 4).
Patients in the cohorts receiving trebananib combined

with bevacizumab or motesanib had diagnoses of advanced
solid tumours across various tumour types. In contrast,
patients in the cohorts receiving trebananib combined
with sorafenib or sunitinib had primary diagnoses of renal
cell cancer. To avoid invalid comparisons between those
two patient groups, only findings from cohorts receiving
trebananib combined with bevacizumab or motesanib
are presented in the current report. Those cohorts
were cohort 1 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1 + bevacizumab
15 mg kg−1), cohort 2 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1 + motesanib
75 mg), cohort 3 (trebananib 10 mg kg−1 + bevacizumab
15 mg kg−1), and cohort 4 (trebananib 3 mg kg−1 +
motesanib 125 mg). Trebananib and bevacizumab were
administered intravenously QW and once every 3 weeks
(Q3W), respectively; motesanib was self-administered
orally by patients once daily (QD). For each cohort,
trebananib was initiated on day 1 of the second week; the
first dose of bevacizumab or motesanib was administered
on day 1 of the first week. For patients in cohorts 1 and 3,
trebananib was administered at least 30 minutes following
bevacizumab infusion on days when both therapies were
administered; for patients in cohorts 2 and 4, trebananib
and motesanib had to be administered simultaneously.
Trebananib dose levels were selected based on the firstin-human monotherapy study showing trebananib up to
30 mg kg−1 to be tolerable [16]. The study protocol was
amended to remove trebananib 30 mg/kg, consistent with
dosing in a planned phase 2 study. Tolerable dose levels of
bevacizumab and motesanib were established upon review
of completed clinical trials [21, 25].
An initial three patients entered cohort 1
(trebananib plus bevacizumab) and cohort 2 (trebananib
plus motesanib). If none of the initial three patients
experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in cohort
1 or 2, up to six patients were enrolled to receive a
higher dose (10 mg kg−1) of trebananib with the same
dose (15 mg kg−1) of bevacizumab in cohort 3 and
the same dose (3 mg kg−1) of trebananib with a higher
dose (125 mg) of motesanib in cohort 4. If one of the
initial three patients in cohort 1 or 2 experienced a
DLT, that cohort was expanded to six patients. In this
expanded cohort 1 or 2, if fewer than three patients
experienced a DLT, up to six patients were enrolled
into the corresponding higher dose cohort 3 or 4. If
two or more of the initial three patients in cohort 1 or 2
experienced a DLT, no additional patients were enrolled
into the respective higher dose cohorts. A maximum of 10
additional patients could be added to one cohort of each
treatment combination (trebananib plus bevacizumab and
trebananib plus motesanib), irrespective of dosage. Since
patients received only bevacizumab or motesanib for the
first study week before trebananib dosing was initiated,
any patient who experienced a DLT during the first study
week was withdrawn and replaced with a new patient.
Patients who discontinued the study during the first study
month were also withdrawn and replaced. DLTs occurring
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

during the first study week did not influence the dose
escalation process. For any patient in a given cohort who
experienced a treatment deviation with trebananib during
the first study month, an additional patient was enrolled.
A DLT was any related, grade 3 or higher
haematologic or nonhaematologic toxicity during the
initial 28 study days, except for the following adjustments
(which were required for those AEs to be considered dose
limiting): transient grade 3 infusion reactions lasting more
than 2 hours; grade 3 fatigue for more than 7 days; grade
3 or 4 nausea, diarrhoea, or vomiting despite maximum
supportive care; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever above
38.5°C; grade 4 neutropenia for more than 7 days; grade
4 thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and hypertension; grade 4
aspartate or alanine aminotransferase greater than 10 times
the upper limit of normal.
Primary endpoints were the incidence of adverse
events and PK of trebananib and motesanib. Secondary
endpoints were anti–trebananib antibody formation, the
biomarker profile, and tumor response.
Blood pressure monitoring. Patients’ blood pressure
was measured based on the Seventh Report of the Joint
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). All
measurements were conducted on site and according to the
following guidelines: caffeine, exercise, and smoking were
avoided for at least 30 minutes before the measurement;
patients should be seated for at least 5 minutes in a chair
(rather than on an examination table), with feet on the
floor, and arm supported at the heart level; an appropriately
sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the
arm) was used to ensure accuracy. Blood pressure was
measured according to the following schedule: screening,
weeks 1 and 5 (predose, 1, 4, and 24 hours postdose);
weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and beyond (predose); end of study visit.

Adverse events
Adverse events were recorded and classified
following the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities and subsequently graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.3.0). Adverse events
were determined by clinical evaluations and laboratory
assessments at screening and on the first day of every
study week. Unless otherwise noted, this report presents
treatment-related adverse events as assessed by the clinical
investigator based on a reasonable possibility that the
event could be related to any of the study treatments. All
patients who received ≥1 dose of any study agent were
included in this analysis set.

Pharmacokinetics
Motesanib PK was assessed by comparing
week 1 versus week 4 or 5 (motesanib without and
11164

with trebananib, respectively). Serum samples for the
evaluation of minimum and maximum observed trebananib
concentrations in the plasma were collected immediately
before dosing on day 1 of weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and every
8 weeks thereafter until 4 weeks after the last dose of study
treatment. In addition, intensive sampling was conducted
at the end of infusion, and 6, 24, 48, and 96 hours
following dosing on day 1 of weeks 4 or 5. The samples
were analysed for trebananib concentrations employing a
validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [16].
Assessment of bevacizumab PK interaction
with trebananib was not feasible due to bevacizumab
accumulation between weeks 1 and 5. For motesanib,
postdose samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 4, 6, and 24 hours
during weeks 1 and 5 (without and with trebananib
coadministration, respectively). Motesanib plasma
concentrations were assessed with a validated liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method
at Cedra Corporation (Austin, TX).

Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of measureable
disease was conducted within a 4–week time window
before treatment initiation and extended to 8 weeks for
brain imaging. Tumour response was evaluated with
CT or MRI at week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter and
categorized using RECIST, version 1.0 [24]. Patients who
discontinued the study before week 8 were evaluated for
tumour response during the last visit. All patients who
received ≥1 dose of trebananib and had a baseline and
at least one postdose assessment of tumour burden were
included in this analysis set. Tumour burden was defined
as the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) for up to 10
target lesions.

Statistical analysis
Tolerability, PK, and tumor measurements and
response results are expressed with descriptive statistics.
For biomarker analyses, log–transformed analyte values
were tested for changes from baseline to the treatment
time points. Statistical significance (P<0.01) for change
from baseline was based on the analysis of variance using
an F–test.

Immunogenicity
Serum samples were evaluated for immunogenicity
of trebananib prior to dosing during weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, and
every 4 weeks thereafter until study termination. Two
validated assays, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
immunoassay and ECL receptor-binding neutralising
assay, were used to detect anti-trebananib binding and
neutralizing antibodies, respectively [26]. A sample was
defined as positive for neutralizing antibodies when it
was positive for binding antibodies in the immunoassay

This study was funded by Amgen Inc. The authors
would like to thank Terrance J. Williams, PhD (Amgen
Inc.) for assistance in the preparation of this manuscript,
and NgocDiep Le and Chris M. Storgard for their
contribution to study oversight.

Biomarkers
Pharmacodynamic profiles of biomarkers were
evaluated in serum samples obtained immediately before
and 24 and 72 hours after dosing during weeks 1 and 2
and before dosing during weeks 3, 4, and 8 and every
8 weeks thereafter until the last study visit. Specific
biomarkers assessed included angiogenic cytokines
(VEGF, placental growth factor [PLGF]), soluble
VEGFR-2, soluble c-Kit receptor (sKit), and soluble
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1). To
quantify PLGF and VEGF levels, a three-plex sandwich
immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent detection
(Meso-Scale Discoveries [MSD], Gaithersburg, MD])
was used. VEGFR-2 and sKit levels were measured with
a two-plex MSD assay. sVCAM-1 levels were quantified
using specific ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN). All biomarker measurements were conducted as
previously described [27]. The detection of VEGF was
completely inhibited when bevacizumab was added to
samples during assay validation. Therefore, VEGF results
are not reported for cohorts 1 and 3.
