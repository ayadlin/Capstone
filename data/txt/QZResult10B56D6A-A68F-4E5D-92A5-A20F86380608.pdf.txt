Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents
5.5% of malignancies worldwide, with f30,000 new cases and
f11,000 deaths reported in the United States annually. The
opioid growth factor (OGF; [Met5]-enkephalin) and the OGF
receptor (OGFr) form an endogenous growth regulating
system; the OGF-OGFr axis influences the G0-G1 phase of
the cell cycle in HNSCC. Cells treated with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) for OGFr no longer responded to the growth
inhibitory effects of OGF or the growth stimulatory effects
of naltrexone, indicating that these activities are entirely
mediated by OGFr. In this investigation, we examined the
precise target of OGF in the cell cycle. Using SCC-1 cells, OGF
decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein.
This change was correlated with reduced Cdk4, but not Cdk2,
kinase activity. OGF treatment increased cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p16 protein expression. Importantly, p16
complexed with Cdk4 was increased by OGF treatment at all
time points, consistent with the hypothesis that OGF mediated
growth inhibition through p16. Blockade of OGF-OGFr
interactions with naloxone abolished the increased expression
of p16 protein by OGF. Inhibition of p16 (INK4a) activation
by p16-specific siRNA blocked OGF’s repressive action on
proliferation of SCC-1, CAL-27, and SCC-4 HNSCC cells.
These data are the first to reveal that the target of cell
proliferative inhibitory action of OGF in human HNSCC is a
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory pathway, and this may be
useful in the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The opioid growth factor (OGF), chemically termed [Met5]enkephalin, is an endogenous opioid peptide that is an important
regulator of the progression of human head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC; refs. 1–3). OGF is a constitutively
expressed native opioid that is autocrine produced and secreted
and interacts with the OGF receptor (OGFr) to inhibit the growth
of HNSCC cells in vitro and in tumor xenografts (2–4). The action
of OGF is tonic, stereospecific, reversible, noncytotoxic, and
nonapoptotic-inducing, not associated with differentiative, migratory, invasive, or adhesive processes, independent of serum,
anchorage-independent, and occurs at physiologically relevant
concentrations in a wide variety of HNSCC cancers, including
poorly and well-differentiated human cell lines (1, 3, 4). The only

opioid peptide, natural or synthetic, that influences the growth of
HNSCC is OGF (4). The action of this opioid in these neoplasias is
targeted to DNA synthesis (5) and is directed toward the G0-G1
interface of the cell cycle (6). Exogenous administration of OGF has
a profound antitumor action on xenografts of HNSCC that includes
delaying tumor appearance and reducing tumor size (1, 2). The
combination of biotherapy with OGF and chemotherapy with
paclitaxel has proved to enhance antitumor effectiveness beyond
either agent alone (2, 3).
The gene for human OGFr is at least 9 kb in length, composed of
seven exons and six introns, and encodes a 677–amino acid protein
that includes seven imperfect repeats of 20 amino acids each and a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (7). OGFr has an apparent
mass of 62 kDa. The chromosomal location of the human OGFr is
20q13.3 (7). Although OGFr has characteristics of a classic opioid
receptor (recognizes opioids, naloxone reversibility, stereospecificity), there is no homology of OGFr with classic opioid receptors in
terms of nucleotides or amino acids (7). Antisense experiments
with OGFr and continuous blockade of opioid receptors by the
potent opioid antagonist naltrexone support that the OGF-OGFr
axis is a tonically active inhibitory system targeted to cell
replication and homeostasis and is ligand-dependent for function
(7). Immunoelectron and confocal microscopy have shown that
OGFr is localized to the outer nuclear envelope, nucleus, and
perinuclear cytoplasm (8, 9). Gene expression (7) and protein
expression (7) of OGFr, as well as binding activity (7), have been
identified and characterized in HNSCC cell lines, revealing the
autocrine nature of this growth regulatory axis.
Given that OGF is known to influence cell proliferation and that
flow cytometry studies indicate that the G0-G1 of the cell cycle is
altered, the present investigation examined the specific target(s)
with the cell cycle for the OGF-OGFr axis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The SCC-1 cell line was obtained from the University of
Michigan Cancer Research Laboratory (Thomas E. Carey, Ph.D.), and
CAL-27 and SCC-4 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. SCC-1 and CAL-27 cells were cultured in DMEM media, whereas
SCC-4 cells were grown in 1:1 Hams F-12 DMEM media. All media (Penn
State University) was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone),
1.2% sodium bicarbonate, and 5,000 units/mL penicillin, 5 Ag/mL
streptomycin, and 10 Ag/mL neomycin.
OGF treatment. OGF was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in
sterile water, and used at a final concentration of 10 6 mol/L.
Cell growth and flow cytometry. For growth curves, cells were seeded
in six-well plates at an initial density of f2  105 cells per well. Fresh
media and OGF were added 24 h after initial seeding, and media and OGF
were replaced daily. At appropriate times, the cells were washed with PBS
and trypsinized, and viable cell numbers were counted by trypan blue
exclusion using a hemacytometer.
For flow cytometry, cells were synchronized with 0.5 Ag/mL nocodazole
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h, followed by three washes with complete media.
Cells were released from growth arrest by addition of complete media or

Figure 1. OGF inhibits SCC-1 growth by
arresting cells in G1. A, SCC-1 cells were
grown in the presence of 10 6 mol/L OGF
for 96 h. Cells were counted after 48, 72,
or 96 h of treatment. The number of cells in
OGF-treated cultures were significantly
reduced from control cultures receiving
sterile water at 72 h (1, P < 0.05)
and 96 h (11, P < 0.01). B, OGFr is

cells were transfected with OGFr siRNAs
or control siRNAs for 24 h in the presence
of 10 6 mol/L OGF, 10 6 mol/L naltrexone
(NTX), or sterile water. Cells were
harvested at 96 h and counted with a
hemacytometer. Columns, means for two
independent experiments; bars, SE. Cell
numbers differed from wild-type (WT ) or

(111).

OGF-supplemented media. Synchronized cells were treated with 10 6 mol/L
OGF for 14 h, harvested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Mediatech), and fixed
with 70% ethanol at 20jC for up to 7 days before DNA analysis. DNA
content was obtained by incubating cells in PBS containing propidium
iodide (0.1 mg/mL) and RNase A (0.02 mg/mL) for 15 min at 22jC.
Fluorescence was measured and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan
flow cytometer and Modfit Software.
Small interfering RNA knockdown of OGFr. The OGFr-targeted small
interfering RNAs (siRNA; antisense, 5¶-uagaaacucagguuuggcg-3¶; sense, 5¶cgccaaaccugaguuucua-3¶) were designed and obtained as ready-annealed,
purified duplex probes from Ambion. For transfection, 5  104 cells per well
were seeded in six-well plates containing 1 mL of serum-containing media
without antibiotics. In each well, 20 nmol/L OGFr-siRNA or control
siRNAsolutions in serum-free media were added. Cells were incubated for
4 h at 37jC before the addition of OGF. Cultures were incubated for an
additional 20 h, and then 1-mL fresh complete media, either lacking or
containing OGF, was added. At 96 h, cells were collected for computing
growth. Two independent experiments were conducted. The control siRNAs
were purchased from Ambion.

Western blot analysis. Synchronized cells (f2  106) from each
treatment were solubilized in 200 AL radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (1 PBS, 10 Amol/L IGEPAL, 1 mg/mL SDS, 5 mg/mL deoxycholic
acid), containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors [2 Ag/mL aprotinin,
3 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanidate, 1 Amol/L okadaic acid]. Total protein concentrations were measured
using the detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Equal amounts of protein (40 Ag) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE,
followed by transfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore)
using standard protocols. The following antibodies were purchased from
commercial sources: phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Ser807/811) from Cell
Signaling Technology; phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Thr821) from Biosource,; Cdk4, cyclin D1, p15, p16, p18, and p19 from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; total retinoblastoma, p21, and p27 from BD PharMingen;
and h-actin (Clone AC-15) from Sigma. The following dilutions of primary
antibodies were used to detect respective proteins: 1:200 phosphorylated
retinoblastoma (Ser807/811), 1:200 phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Thr821),
1:200 Cdk4, 1:200 cyclin D1, 1:100 p16, 1:200 total retinoblastoma, 1:200 p21,
1:100 p27. Membranes were probed with secondary antirabbit or antimouse

horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies (GE Healthcare-Amersham
Biosciences); blots were developed using a chemiluminescence Western
blotting detection system (GE Healthcare-Amersham Biosciences).
To determine equal loading of total protein samples, blots were reprobed
with monoclonal antibody against h-actin at a dilution of 1:2,000. If
necessary, membranes were stripped in stripping buffer [62.5 mmol/L TrisHCl and 100 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol/2% SDS (pH 6.7)] at 50jC before
being reprobed. Means and SE were determined from three or more
independent experiments.
Quantitation of Western blots. To quantify expression levels or kinase
activity, the absorbance of each band was determined by densitometry and
analyzed by QuickOne (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Each value was normalized
to h-actin from the same blot. To report the changes due to OGF treatment,
we calculated the fold increase by dividing the normalized value from the
OGF-treated samples by the normalized value of control samples at each
time point; thus, increases due to OGF have values of >1 and decreases due
to OGF have values of <1.
Immunoprecipitation and retinoblastoma kinase assay. For immunoprecipitating protein complexes, cell extracts were prepared as follows:
2  106 cells per sample were rinsed in cold PBS, followed by lysis in
100 AL NP40 immunoprecipitation buffer [1% NP40, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L NaF, 2 Ag/mL
antipain, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanidate, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin, 2 Ag/mL
leupeptin, 1 Ag/mL pepstatin A, 1 Amol/L okadaic acid, 1 mmol/L PMSF,

1 mmol/L DTT]. For each immunoprecipitation reaction mixture, a total
of 500 Ag of protein extract was used. The lysates were then subjected
to immunoprecipitation using 10 AL polyclonal antibody against Cdk4
prebound with agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz) for 60 min at 4jC. Then
immunoprecipitates were mixed with kinase buffer [25 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L MgCl2], 5 ACi g32P-ATP, and retinoblastoma
(769–921; Santa Cruz) as the substrate for Cdk4. After incubation for
30 min at 30jC, with occasional mixing, the reaction was stopped by the
addition of 2 sample loading buffer [0.5 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
4.4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol,
and bromophenol blue in distilled/deionized water]. Proteins in the
reaction mixture were separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The Cdk4
kinase activity pattern was visualized by autoradiography of phosphorylated retinoblastoma.
p16/Cdk4 assay. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation
using antibodies against Cdk4 and protein A beads (Santa Cruz).
Immunoprecipitates were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and membrane
blots probed with p16 antibodies (1:200) and developed using a
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system as described earlier.
Blots were reprobed with Cdk4 antibody (1:200). Five independent
experiments were done.
siRNA knockdown of p16INK4a. The p16-targeted siRNAs (antisense, 5¶acaccgcttctgccttttctt-3¶; sense, 5¶-gaaaaggcagaagcggtgttt-3¶; ref. 10) were
obtained as ready-annealed, purified duplex probes (Invitrogen). For

Figure 3. OGF-induced p16 expression.
A, SCC-1 cells were synchronized by
nocodazole (0.5 Ag/mL) for 24 h and
subsequently treated with 10 6 mol/L OGF
or sterile water for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h.
Total proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and blotted with p16-specific
antibodies. Densitometric analysis of the
Western blots was done, and p16
expression for OGF-treated cells is
expressed relative to controls at each time
point. The p16 level was significantly
elevated (1, P < 0.05) from the control
group at 3 h. B, to examine whether the
OGF-induced down-regulation of Cdk4
kinase activity was based on p16-Cdk4
complex formation, homogenates of SCC-1
cells treated with OGF or sterile water were
subjected to Cdk4 immunoprecipitation;
the resulting proteins were blotted with
antibodies to p16. Densitometric analysis
of Western blots of immunoprecipitated
p16-Cdk4 protein complex at 3, 6, 9, and
12 h revealed that p16 complexed to Cdk4
was increased at all time points and was
significantly different from control group at
P < 0.05 (1) at 9 and 12 h. C, to examine
for opioid receptor mediation, synchronized
cells were treated with 10 6 mol/L OGF,
10 5 mol/L naloxone (NAL ), both OGF
and naloxone, or sterile vehicle (control)
for 3 h. Protein lysates were resolved on
SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot
analysis for p16 and actin. Densitometric
analysis of p16 expression showed that
p16 levels of OGF-treated cells were
significantly elevated from control levels at
P < 0.05 (1); no change was recorded in
the naloxone and OGF-naloxone groups.

1 mL of serum-free media without antibiotics. In each well, 20 nmol/L of
p16-siRNA or control siRNAsolutions in serum-free media were added.
Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37jC before the addition of OGF. Cultures
were incubated for additional 20 h, and then 1 mL fresh complete media,
either lacking or containing OGF, was added. At the indicated time points,
cells were collected for growth curves or Western blotting. Three or more
independent experiments were conducted. The control siRNAs were
purchased from Ambion.
Statistical analysis. Values were assessed by one-way ANOVA and
Newman Keul’s post–multiple comparison tests. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
OGF inhibits cell proliferation and retards progression
through the cell cycle. Continuous exposure to exogenous OGF
inhibited the growth of SCC-1 human HNSCC cells. Cell number in
the OGF-treated wells was 87.5% compared with controls at 72 h
and 59.0% of controls at 96 h (Fig. 1A). Linear regression analysis of
the data revealed mean doubling times for the OGF and control
groups of f41.3 and 21.6 h, respectively, and differed from each
other at P < 0.001.

To examine the specificity of OGF for OGFr, knockdown
experiments with OGFr-siRNA were conducted (Fig. 1B). Exposure
to 10 6 mol/L OGF depressed the growth of wild-type and control
siRNA-treated cells by 29% and 46%, respectively, whereas 10 6
mol/L naltrexone increased the number of wild-type and control
siRNA-exposed cells by 24% and 27%, respectively. SCC-1 cells
subjected to OGFr-siRNA had f19% more cells than wild-type and
control siRNA-treated cultures. In contrast to cells expressing
OGFr, exposure to 10 6 mol/L OGF or naltrexone had no further
effects on the OGFr-siRNA cultures.
Based on growth curves, we analyzed the effect of OGF on cell
cycle distribution by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). The percentage of
OGF-treated cells in the G0-G1 phase was 34.6% compared with
21.9% of the control cells (Fig. 1D); this increase in the number of
cells in the G0-G1 phase was significantly (P < 0.001) different from
sterile water control values. Correspondingly, the number of OGFexposed cells in the S phase decreased to 42.7% relative to 51.9% of
the sterile water–treated cells. The number of cells subjected to OGF
in the G2-M phase was 22.7% relative to 26.2% for control samples.
OGF treatment does not change total retinoblastoma
protein but decreases the amount of phosphorylated retinoblastoma. The phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein is

necessary for cells to progress from G1 phase to S phase. To
elucidate the role of retinoblastoma in OGF-induced SCC-1 cell
growth inhibition, retinoblastoma expression and the phosphorylated state of retinoblastoma were assessed in synchronized SCC-1
cells. Expression of total retinoblastoma protein was not decreased
from baseline values after 14 h of OGF treatment (data not shown).
However, the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Ser801/811),
which is specifically phosphorylated by Cdk4 in the G1 phase (11),
was significantly decreased after a 6-h, 9-h, and 12-h exposure to
10 6 mol/L OGF (Fig. 2A and B). Although phosphorylated
retinoblastoma (pThr821) was specifically phosphorylated by Cdk2
in the G1 phase (11), OGF treatment did not alter the results of
Western blot analysis of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pThr821)
levels (Fig. 2A and B). These results suggest that Cdk4, but not
Cdk2, was involved in the OGF-induced cell cycle block at the G1
phase in SCC-1 cells.
Total levels of p105 and p107, which are alternative pathways to
retinoblastoma regulation, revealed no changes in basal levels of
proteins after exposure to OGF (data not shown).
OGF reduces Cdk4 kinase activity. To verify whether OGFinduced down-regulation of phosphorylated retinoblastoma was
associated with changes in Cdk4, Cdk4 expression, and activity
levels were determined. The expression of Cdk4 protein did not
change after OGF exposure (Fig. 2C). When retinoblastoma was
used as substrate in immunoprecipitation experiments done with
antibodies against Cdk4, lysates from cells treated with OGF for
3 h showed a transient increase of Cdk4 kinase activity; at 6, 9, and
12 h, there was a marked decrease in Cdk4 kinase activities relative
to controls (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that OGF-mediated
decrease of phosphorylated retinoblastoma was correlated with the
reduction in Cdk4 kinase activities.
OGF does not affect the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. To examine
whether the OGF-induced down-regulation of Cdk4 kinase activity
was based on a decrease in cyclin D1 expression, homogenates of
SCC-1 cells were subjected to Cdk4 immunoprecipitation. Cyclin

SCC-1 cells were synchronized by nocodazole (0.5 Ag/mL) for 24 h and
subsequently treated with 10 6 mol/L OGF for 3, 6, 9, or 12 h. Total protein
lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to antibodies specific to
each CKI. Densitometic analysis revealed no significant differences between
OGF and sterile water–treated values.

D1 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. The level of
the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex after treatment with OGF revealed no
change from control levels (data not shown).
CDK inhibitor p16 expression is up-regulated by OGF. Cell
cycle progression depends on both positive and negative
regulators. Expression of p16 was evaluated in synchronized
SCC-1 cells after 3, 6, 9, and 12 h of OGF exposure. p16 was
significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05) in OGF-treated cells relative to
control cells only at 3 h (Fig. 3A). Because p16 inhibits Cdk4 by
physical interaction, we examined whether the OGF-induced
down-regulation of Cdk4 kinase activity was based on p16-Cdk4
complex formation. To explore this possibility, homogenates of
SCC-1 cells were subjected to Cdk4 immunoprecipitation and the
precipitated proteins were probed with p16 antibodies. The level of
the p16-Cdk4 complex after OGF treatment was elevated at all
time points compared with control and reached statistical
significance (P < 0.05) at 9 and 12 h (Fig. 3B).
To show the opioid-receptor mediation of OGF, cells were
treated concomitantly with the opioid antagonist naloxone and
OGF. OGF-induced up-regulation of p16 expression was blocked in
cells exposed to both naloxone and OGF; naloxone alone had no
effect on p16 expression (Fig. 3C). This result showed that OGFinduced up-regulation of p16 expression was receptor mediated.
p16 is known as a tumor suppressor gene, functioning as a cell
cycle inhibitor by forming heterotrimeric complexes with Cdks
and cyclins. Therefore, the data suggest that, under the effect
of OGF, p16 protein level was up-regulated and the p16retinoblastoma pathway was activated that, in turn, mediated the
cell cycle block.
Analysis of the expression of cell cycle inhibitors p15, p18, p19,
p21, and p27 revealed that OGF treatment had no significant effect
on these CKIs (Fig. 4). No p57 protein was detected in SCC-1 (data
not shown). Thus, OGF treatment results in the induction of only
p16 in HNSCC.
siRNA directed against p16 blocked OGF inhibitory action.
To test the role of p16 in OGF-induced inhibitory action on SCC-1
cell growth, siRNA knockdown experiments were used. SCC-1 cells
were treated with p16 siRNA or with negative control siRNA.
Western blot analysis revealed that cells transfected with p16
siRNA had significantly reduced levels of p16 protein compared
with untransfected cells after 72 h (Fig. 5A). Growth analysis of
cells transfected with p16 siRNAs and subsequently exposed to
OGF for 96 h showed that p16 induction is required for the OGF
inhibitory action on SCC-1 cell growth (Fig. 5B). SCC-1 cells
transfected with the negative control siRNAs and exposed to OGF
had significant reductions in growth of 24% and 40% at 72 and 96 h,
respectively.
To examine the ubiquity of the integral role of p16 inhibition,
two other HNSCC cell lines were examined: CAL-27 and SCC-4. In
synchronized CAL-27 cells, OGF increased p16 expression at 9 h
relative to controls (data not shown). Western blot analysis of
protein isolated from CAL-27 cells transfected with p16 siRNA had
significantly reduced p16 levels relative to control cells (data not
shown). Growth curves revealed that OGF had no inhibitory effects
on CAL-27 cells lacking p16 (Fig. 5C). In another cell line, SCC-4,
OGF treatment induced p16 expression at 3 h relative to
synchronized control cells (data not shown). Protein isolated from
SCC-4 cells transfected with p16 siRNAs and analyzed by Western
blot showed significantly reduced levels of p16 protein compared
with control cells at 72 h (data not shown). Growth curves of these
SCC-4 cells showed that OGF had no effect on cells lacking p16

expression (Fig. 5D) but that OGF significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited
(a decrease of 43%) the growth of SCC-4 cells transfected with
negative control siRNAs for 96 h.

Discussion
The OGF-OGFr axis has been documented by structural,
pharmacologic, and biochemical evidence to be present and to
function as a regulatory system for growth in HNSCC. First, OGF
and OGFr have been identified in human HNSCC cell lines and
surgical specimens by immunohistochemistry (4, 12–14). Second,
OGFr has been characterized in human HNSCC cells and tissues
by receptor binding (1, 2, 12, 13, 15) and Western blotting (12)
and shown to have at least a 7-fold greater affinity for OGFr than
any other natural or synthetic opioid peptide (including those
specific for A, y, or n classic opioid receptors; ref. 15). Third,
exogenous OGF depresses the proliferation of human HNSCC
cells in vitro (3, 4) and in xenografts (1, 2, 13), and elimination of
endogenous OGF neutralizes this peptide’s action on cell
replication (4). However, these previous studies do not directly
show that OGF, which also recognizes other classic opioid
receptors (16), may also elicit naloxone-sensitive antiproliferative
signaling through these receptors instead of or in addition to
OGFr. The logical extension of this query is that the effects of
OGF on the cell cycle may be related to OGFr and/or other opioid
receptors. Using OGFr knockdown experiments, the present
report now shows, for the first time, that the specific and singular
receptor for OGF action on the replication of an HNSCC cell line
is OGFr. Cells with silencing of OGFr are not altered by addition
of OGF. Moreover, these cells with a knockdown of OGFr are
not influenced by naltrexone, documenting that other opioid
receptors are not involved with the effects of this general opioid
receptor antagonist. Thus, the elucidation of the target of OGF in
this study is directly, and solely, related to OGFr.
This study shows for the first time that the target of the negative
growth regulator OGF is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16.
Using a HNSCC cell line, SCC-1, that exhibited growth inhibition
after exposure to OGF and flow cytometry observations documenting that OGF impeded cells exiting G0-G1, we now conclude that
the peptide action is related to a key regulator of the G1-S phase
transition — the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein. This
would suggest that OGF action with regard to the cell cycle is not
broad based but rather extremely specific to a pathway focused on
the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma. The effects of OGF on p16
were found to be receptor mediated, as concomitant exposure to
the opioid antagonist naloxone blocked the up-regulation of p16 by
OGF; naloxone treatment alone had no effect on p16 levels,
indicating that there was not simply a counterbalance of upregulation and down-regulation between OGF and naloxone.
Finally, confirmation that p16 was indeed the target of OGF was
validated in siRNAstudies, whereas HNSCC cells exposed to p16
siRNA exhibited no change in growth after exposure to OGF. Thus,
our study makes the novel finding that OGF is directed to a
singular component of the cell cycle.
This investigation also shows that the action of OGF on the p16
cyclin–dependent inhibitory kinase in SCC-1 is not specific to the
SCC-1 cell line but that the p16-retinoblastoma pathway is present
and active in a number of other HNSCC cell lines. Thus, two other
cell lines exhibiting different levels of differentiation and origin,
SCC-4 and CAL-27 cell lines, showed that the p16 pathway was
targeted by OGF as well. SCC-1 and SCC-4 were derived from a

www.aacrjournals.org

well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in
74-year-old and 55-year-old males (4), whereas CAL-27 was derived
from a poorly differentiated HNSCC of the tongue of a 56-year-old
male (4). Thus, OGF seems to act on the p16 pathway in a variety of
HNSCC cell lines, suggesting that this may be the primary pathway
of cell cycle influence of the OGF-OGFr axis in these cancers.
Whether OGF also influences p16 in vivo in humans is unclear and
requires further study.
During the cell cycle progression, retinoblastoma is sequentially
phosphorylated by different cyclin-Cdk complexes (17). Different
phosphorylation sites in retinoblastoma have been shown, with the
preferred site being Ser807/811 by Cdk4-cyclin D and Thr821 by Cdk2
(11). Our observation that OGF down-regulated the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma on Ser807/811 is consistent with decreased
Cdk4 kinase activity. Although in vitro assays of Cdk4 kinase
activity showed a transient increase at 3 h of OGF treatment, Cdk4
activity was decreased relative to controls at all later time points in
response to OGF treatment. This reduction in Cdk4 kinase activity
correlated with an increase in Cdk4-p16 complex formation in the
OGF-exposed cells relative to control cultures at all time points.
The transient increase in Cdk4 kinase activity at 3 h is unclear and
suggests that there may be other signaling pathways affecting Cdk4
activity. We also observed that OGF had no effect on retinoblastoma Thr821 phosphorylation, which implies that OGF did not
affect Cdk2 activity. Thus, OGF exerts its effects in these cells by
inducing Cdk4-p16 complexes.
p16 has been considered as a target for potential anticancer
drugs. For example, indole-3-carbinol, a naturally occurring
component of Brassica vegetables, strongly stimulated the
production of the p16-Cdk inhibitor and induced a block in G1
cell cycle in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells (18). Recently, studies
showed that transfection of exogenous wild-type p16 gene induced
bladder cancer cells to be arrested in G0-G1 phase (19). Our results
with OGF and HNSCC are consistent in finding that up-regulating
p16 expression has a negative effect on growth. However, in the
case of HNSCC, these changes are transient and not permanent,
suggesting that OGF has cytostatic, but not cytotoxic, effects. These
observations support our studies showing that OGF has no effect
on apoptosis (20).
The clinical ramifications of our findings merit further
discussion. A review of the literature indicates that most HNSCC
tumors resected in patients contain p16, hence our selection of
HNSCC cell lines that were known to have p16. For example, Zhang
et al. (21) have reported 10% of mutations and deletions of p16 in
primary tumors and 44% in cell lines. Lydiatt et al. (22) have
reported 19% of genetic alterations of p16 in HNSCC tumors and
75% in cell lines. Therefore, neoplasias with the p16 pathway would
be predicted to react positively to OGF therapy. In the case of cell
lines without p16, we have observed that these cells (23) do
respond to OGF with regard to receptor-mediated growth
inhibition. Whether they use a different cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathway needs to be determined.
