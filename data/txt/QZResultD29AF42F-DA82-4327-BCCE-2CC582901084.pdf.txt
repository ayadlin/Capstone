BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) belongs to the tyrosine kinase receptor family. Little is
known about the effect of FGFR4 on gastric cancer (GC). Therefore, the objective of the current study was to elucidate the role of FGFR4 in the tumorigenesis and progression of GC. METHODS: FGFR4 and some common prognosis
markers, including p53, neu, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), were detected in 71 tissue samples from
patients with GC using immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, a series of functional assays were carried out using
small interfering RNA (siRNA) and included proliferation assays, clone assays, and apoptosis detection. RESULTS:
Cytoplasmic FGFR4 expression in GC tissues was negative (7% of samples), low (14.1% of samples), intermediate
(40.8%), and high (38% of samples). FGFR4 expression was associated with lymph node status and with PCNA and
neu expression (P < .05). The 5-year relative survival rate was 61.5% in patients who had GC with low FGFR4 expression but was only 42% in patients who had high FGFR4 expression (P ¼ .058). A subgroup analysis of the patients
who had high FGFR4 expression revealed that those with stage III and IV disease had a worse prognosis (P ¼ .044).
Moreover, knockdown of FGFR4 expression led to decreased proliferation and an increased rate of apoptosis in the
MKN45 and SGC7901 GC cell lines (P < .05). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of caspase 3
increased, whereas the expression of extra-large B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-xL) decreased in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells
after FGFR4-siRNA transfection. CONCLUSIONS: FGFR4 expression in GC tissue was extremely high. The current
results indicated that FGFR4 may contribute to the progression of GC by regulating proliferation and antiapoptosis,

Gastric cancer is the fourth most frequent malignant tumor worldwide.1 Recently, more and more studies have indicated that growth factor receptors are involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of malignant tumors. Among them,
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/fibroblast growth factor-receptor (FGFR) system plays a pivotal role in cancer development through its effects in angiogenesis, differentiation, survival, and motility.2,3 Some reports in the literature have demonstrated that FGFR4, as a member of the FGFR family, plays a crucial role in tissue repair, embryonic development, and
so on.4,5 However, the role of FGFR4 in human cancer, and especially in gastric cancer, has not been explicitly clarified.
Our previous research using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed that FGFR4 messenger
RNA (mRNA) levels were increased remarkably in gastric cancer tissues compared with the levels in corresponding normal
tissues.6 Furthermore, high expression levels of FGFR4 were verified in renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma.7,8
It also was reported that liver tissues has the highest transcript expression of FGFR4 compared with tissues from other
major organs.9 Recently, Ho et al10 reported that FGFR4 contributed significantly to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
progression by modulating a-fetoprotein secretion, proliferation, and antiapoptosis, and Roidl et al11 reported that the

up-regulation of FGFR4 was associated with resistance to
chemotherapy in breast cancer cell lines. To our knowledge, there has been no related research to date about the
function of FGFR4 in the progression of gastric cancer.
To identify the vital role of FGFR4 and to explore
the mechanism of FGFR4 in the tumorigenesis and development of gastric cancer, we conduced immunohistochemical analyses of FGFR4 and of some common
prognosis markers, such as p53, neu, and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), in tissue samples from patients
with gastric cancer. MKN45 and SGC7901, the 2 most
common gastric cancer cell lines in our experiment center,
have different malignant potential. In addition, our preliminary study indicated that expression levels of FGFR4
in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells were significantly higher
than the levels in 2 other gastric cancer cell lines, SNU-1
and SNU-16. Therefore, we choose MKN45 and
SGC7901 cells for FGFR4 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) assays to investigate the knockdown of FGFR4
expression. In addition, we performed a series of functional assays in the MKN45 and SGC7901 cell lines,
including proliferation assays, clone assays, and apoptosis
detection. The findings from this study indicate that
FGFR4 may play an extremely crucial role in gastric cancer growth, apoptosis, and progression, pointing to its
potential as a novel drug target against gastric cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of 71 consecutive,
primary gastric cancers were collected from the tissue
bank at Shanghai Cancer Center, Fu Dan University
(Shanghai, China). All patients were diagnosed and
underwent radical gastrectomy at the Department of Abdominal Surgery in 2003. Treatment decisions were based
on consensus recommendations at the time. All diagnoses
were documented pathologically, and personal files were
retrieved to obtain clinical data (Table 1) with approval of
the hospital’s ethics committee. Follow-up was performed
routinely, and the median follow-up of patients who
remained alive at the time of analysis was 62 months
(range, 4-83 months).
Antibodies
Rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR4 antibody was obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Calif). Rabbit monoclonal antibody against extra-large B-cell lymphoma (anti-Bcl-xL), rabbit monoclonal anticaspase 3,

Semiquantitative Immunohistochemistry
Expression levels of FGFR4, p53, neu, and PCNA in postoperative paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from all
selected patients were detected with immunohistochemistry. The concentrations of antibody and the sites of positive expression were as follows: anti-FGFR4, 1:500
dilution (positive site, cytoplasm); anti-p53, 1:100 dilution (positive site, nucleus); anti-neu, 1:100 dilution (positive site, membrane); and anti-PCNA, 1:100 dilution
(positive site, nucleus). The detailed staining procedures
strictly followed the supplier’s recommendation. Negative
controls were obtained by incubating parallel slides with
the primary antibodies omitted. In addition, sections with
confirmed positive staining from each run served as positive controls.
Immunohistochemical Staining Scores
All slides were evaluated semiquantitatively by 2 independent pathologists (X.Y.Z. and L.Y.) who were blinded
to patients’ clinical data when scoring immunohistochemical results in archival tissue samples. Cytoplasmic
FGFR4 immunostaining was scored on a 4-point scale as
negative (), low (þ), intermediate (þþ), or high
(þþþ).12 In the final analysis, the immunostaining for
each protein was determined as either positive or negative
by using the following cutoff values: Staining for p53 was
interpreted as positive when >10% of the tumor nucleus
was stained; PCNA expression was interpreted as strongly
positive when >60% of the tumor nucleus was stained;
and neu expression was interpreted positive when >10%
of the tumor membrane was stained.
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
The human gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and
SGC7901 were purchased from Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection (Shanghai,
China). Cell lines were cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco), 100 lg/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/mL
streptomycin (Caisson Laboratories, Inc., Logan, Utah) at
37 C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, as described
previously.13
FGFR4 Silencing Using siRNAs
The FGFR4 siRNAs and 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)
negative control siRNAs were purchased from Shanghai
Genepharma RNAi Company (Shanghai, China). We
used the following siRNA sequences: For FGFR4 siRNA
(si1792), the sense sequence was 50 -GCCGACACAA

5306

GAACAUCAUtt-30 , and the antisense sequence was 50 AUGAUGUUCUUGUGUCGGCtt-30 . For the negative
control (control siRNA [siCtrl]), the sense sequence was
50 -UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt-30 , and the antisense sequence was 50 -ACGUGACACGUUCGGA
GAAtt-30 . Each siRNA was transfected into gastric cancer
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The volume ratio of lipofectamine 2000 and
siRNA was 1:2. Transfected cells were assayed at indicated
time points. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the
treated cells were harvested, and specific silencing of
FGFR4 was confirmed at the RNA and protein levels by
Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses.
Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis
Cells were harvested 72 hours after transfection, and
whole-cell lysates were prepared using the Mammalian
Protein Extraction Reagent (Merck, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentrations of samples were determined by using a
bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill).
Protein samples (40 lg of each protein) boiled for 5
minutes were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and transferred onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes.
Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05%
Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dried milk and then were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies under
manufacturer-recommended conditions. Immunoblots
were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 and 1% nonfat milk and were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using
the ECL detection system (Image Quant LAS-3000; General Electric Company, Fairfield, Conn). Three independent Western blot assays were performed for each sample.
Immunofluorescence
Cells (2  104 cells per well) that were transfected with
si1792 and siCtrl for 48 hours were incubated in 96-well
culture plates in 100 lL medium. Twenty-four hours
later, transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and stained with
FGFR4 antibody at 4 C overnight. The cells were incubated with FITC secondary antibody solution at
room temperature for 1 hour. Nuclei were counterstained
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the

expression of FGFR4 was observed and analyzed through
a converted fluorescence microscope.
Cell Proliferation and Clonogenic Assays
Cells that were transfected with si1792 and siCtrl for 48
hours were detached using trypsin and counted. Then, 2
 103 cells per well were incubated in 96-well culture
plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in 100 lL medium.
After culturing for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5
days, the supernatant was removed, and cell growth was
detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450
nm using a microplate reader. After cell transfection for
48 hours, an equal number of cells from the negative and
mock groups and from the FGFR4-knocked down group
were harvested in triplicate and replated onto 60-mm Petri dishes. After 12 to 14 days of incubation, the plates
were gently washed and stained with crystal violet. Viable
colonies that contained >50 cells were counted. All proliferation and clonogenic assays were performed independently at least 3 times, and all experimental data were
analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 13.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).
Apoptosis Analysis
Cells were transfected with 6 lL of si1792 or siCtrl using
3 lL lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After 48 hours, the cells were harvested. The
annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) for flow cytometry
were purchased from Invitrogen (catalog no. V13241;
Invitrogen Life Technologies) for detecting apoptosis,
and 5 lL annexin V and 1 lL 100 lg/mL PI working solution were added to each 100 lL of cell suspension. The
cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes;
then, 400 lL of 1 times annexin-binding buffer were
added and mixed gently, and the samples were kept on ice
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Thereafter,
all samples were analyzed by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). All experiments to detect apoptosis were performed independently at least 3 times, and all experimental data were entered into the SPSS 13.0 software program
for analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical
software package SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Inc.). Molecular analyses were carried out with the investigators blinded to

clinical data. Associations between categorical variables
were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square test. Survival
curves were plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier
method, and comparisons between groups were performed using the log-rank test. Data are expressed as the
mean  standard deviation of 3 individual experiments
done in triplicate. The Student t test was used to compare
data between 2 groups. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and the Dunnett test were used to compare
data between 3 or more groups. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Association Between FGFR4 Expression and
Clinicopathologic Characteristics
Cytoplasmic FGFR4 immunostaining in gastric cancer
tissue samples was 7% negative (), 14.1% low (þ),
40.8% intermediate (þþ), and 38% high (þþþ) (Fig.
1). To study correlations between FGFR4 expression and
clinicopathologic characteristics, the sample were divided
into 2 groups for analysis: a low FGFR4 expression group
(including , þ, and þþ samples) and a high FGFR4
expression group (including þþþ samples). FGFR4
expression was associated positively with lymph node status, neu expression, and PCNA expression, as indicated in
Table 1, and the differences were statistically significant
(P ¼ .020, P ¼ .026, and P ¼ .021, respectively).
An analysis of prognosis indicated that the 5-year
relative survival rate (RSR) was 61.5% in patients who
had gastric cancer with low FGFR4 expression but only
42% in patients who had gastric cancer with high FGFR4
expression, although the difference was not statistically
significant (P ¼ .058) (Fig. 2A). A subgroup analysis
revealed that the prognosis for both groups was similar
among patients who had stage I/II disease (Fig. 2B). However, among the patients who had high FGFR4 expression, patients with stage III/IV disease had a worse
prognoses (P ¼ .044) (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, between
the 2 groups, significant difference in survival was
observed for patients with N1 through N3 lymph node
status (Fig. 2D).

groups, green fluorescence staining in MKN45 and
SGC7901 cells that were treated with FGFR4 si1792 for
72 hours was weakened significantly, which meant that
si1792 could knock down FGFR4 expression (Fig. 3AD). Furthermore, the results from Western blot analysis
revealed that FGFR4 protein expression in the si1792
group decreased remarkably comparing with that in the
mock and negative groups, in accordance with our immunofluorescence assay results (Fig. 3E).
FGFR4 Expression Affects the Proliferation
Ability of Gastric Cancer Cells
To study the role of FGFR4 in the ability of cells to proliferate, we used MKN45 and SGC7901 cells for the transient
knockdown of FGFR4 by FGFR4 siRNA (si1792). After
48 hours of transfection, the CCK-8 kit was used to evaluate
the proliferative ability of MKN45 and SGC7901 cells with
different treatments. In MKN45 cells, absorbency values in
the si1792 group on Days 5, 6, and 7 after transfection were
0.606  0.072, 1.009  0.098, and 1.349  0.081, respectively; whereas the absorbency values in the negative group
were 0.957  0.092, 1.411  0.096, and 1.886  0.095,
respectively (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed in

5308

SGC7901 cells, with absorbency values in the si1792 group
on Days 5, 6, and Day 7 after transfection of 0.891 
0.149, 1.333  0.108, and 1.760  0.108, respectively,
and absorbency values in negative group of 1.306  0.062,
1.792  0.064, and 2.216  0.066, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Obviously, transfection of si1792 efficiently suppressed the
proliferation potential of MKN45 and SGC7901 cells compared with negative siRNA-transfected cells from Days 5, 6,
and 7 after transfection (P < .05; Student t test) (Fig.
4A,B).
Furthermore, in MKN45 cells, cloning efficiency
was 11.57%  1.31% in the si1792 group, 20.47% 
1.00% in the negative group, and 18.57%  1.46% in
the mock group; whereas the cloning efficiency of
SGC7901 cells was 8.52%  1.45%, 21.25%  1.21%,
and 19.07%  1.32%, respectively, which revealed that
cloning efficiency in the si1792 group was remarkably
lower than that in the negative and mock groups with a
difference that was statistically significant (P < .05; 1-way
ANOVA) (Fig. 4C,D). In other words, transfection of
si1792 observably inhibited the proliferative ability of
MKN45 and SGC7901 cells, in accordance with our
CCK-8 assay results.

Figure 2. (A) The log-rank test was used to calculate cumulative (Cum) survival and indicates that patients with gastric cancer
who had low fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) expression had a better prognosis than patients with high FGFR4
expression. However, the differences were not statistically significant (P ¼ .058). (B,C) Although subgroup analyses indicated that
there was no difference in survival between patients with stage I/II disease, patients with stage III/IV disease who had high
FGFR4 expression had a worse prognosis (P ¼ .044). (D) In patients who had N1 to N3 lymph node status, the prognosis for
both groups was similar.

Knockdown of FGFR4 Increases Cell
Apoptosis and Caspase 3 Expression in
Gastric Cancer Cells
To study the role of FGFR4 in cell apoptosis, MKN45
and SGC7901 cells were transiently transfected with
FGFR4 siRNA (si1792) for 48 hours, and the apoptotic
cells were detected by flow cytometry. In MKN45 cells,
the apoptotic rate was 25.37%  0.67% in the si1792
group, 9.57%  0.86% in the negative group, and
10.62%  0.86% in the mock group; whereas, in
SGC7901 cells, the apoptotic rate was 23.31%  0.65%,
10.01%  0.89%, and 9.61%  0.65%, respectively.
The rate of apoptosis in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells
increased remarkably in the si1792 group compared with
the rates in the negative and mock groups, as illustrated in

Cancer

Figure 5A-F. There was a statistically significant difference in the 2 cell lines with different treatments (P < .05;
1-way ANOVA).
We also used the apoptosis-related molecules Bcl-xL
and caspase 3 were to evaluate the apoptotic ability of
MKN45 and SGC7901 cells with under different treatment conditions. Figure 5G indicates that, compared
with negative and mock groups, caspase 3 expression
increased while Bcl-xL expression decreased in MKN45
and SGC7901 cells that were treated with si1792.

human cancers. FGFR4 plays a vital role in influencing
the biologic characteristics of tumor cells, as reported
mainly with regard to disease progression in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and
other tumors.10,11 However, to our knowledge, there is
very little related research in terms of the role of FGFR4
in the tumorigenesis and development of gastric cancer.
Therefore, we investigated the expression of FGFR4 in
gastric cancer tissues and performed a series of functional
assays to identify the vital role of FGFR4 and to explore
the mechanism of FGFR4 in gastric cancer using siRNAmediated down-regulation of FGFR4 expression.
Our previous study indicated that FGFR4 mRNA
expression was increased remarkably in gastric cancer tissues.6 In the current study, immunohistochemical analysis
indicated that there was 95% cytoplasmic staining of
FGFR4 in gastric cancer tissues (including þ, þþ, and
þþþ samples), in accordance with our previous results.
Furthermore, the probability of lymph node metastasis in
patients who had high FGFR4 expression was much
greater than that in patients who had low FGFR4 expression (P ¼ .05), indicating high FGFR4 expression may be
associated with more malignant biologic behavior and a

5310

worse prognosis. When combined with follow-up data,
the 5-year relative survival rate was much higher in
patients with gastric cancer who had low FGFR4 expression, although the difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .058), possibly because of the small sample size
of patients with gastric cancer in our study. A subgroup
analysis indicated that, among the patients who had high
FGFR4 expression, those with stage III/IV disease had a
worse prognosis, in accordance with a previous report that
FGFR4 expression influenced disease progression in
patients with breast cancer.11
The p53 protein is the product of a tumor suppressor gene, which modulates cell proliferation though control of the G1 arrest checkpoint in the cell cycle, as
reported previously.14 Patients with nonfunctional p53
who have gastric cancer usually have more positive lymph
nodes and tend to have a dismal prognosis.15 The HER2/neu protein, which is extensively homologous to the epidermal growth factor receptor, is intimately involved in
normal cell proliferation and tissue growth, has been studied most in the field of breast carcinoma, and is correlated
with a poor prognosis. Moreover, some studies have demonstrated that neu amplification may be an independent

originally was identified as an antigen that was expressed
in the nuclei of cells during the DNA synthesis phase of
the cell cycle. PCNA is important for both DNA synthesis
and DNA repair. Patients who have gastric cancer with
high PCNA expression may have a worse prognosis.17 In
the current study, FGFR4 expression was associated positively with neu expression and PCNA expression, suggesting that patients who have gastric cancer with high
FGFR4 expression may have a more malignant phenotype
and a worse prognosis.
In our study, using the CCK-8 kit to conduct a proliferation assay revealed that the transfection of si1792

efficiently suppressed the proliferative potential of
MKN45 and SGC7901 cells compared with negative
siRNA-transfected cells. Obviously, influencing the ability of cells to proliferate is an effect of FGFR4 signaling in
gastric cancer. These findings suggest that the inactivation
of FGFR4 may reduce tumor growth in gastric cancer.
Wang et al reported that FGFR4 stabilization was associated with enhanced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro in human prostate cancers.18
Furthermore, FGFR4 knockdown using inducible short
hairpin RNA significantly reduced colony-forming ability
in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.19 Cloning efficiency
also is an index that reflects cell proliferation. Our results

Figure 5. Flow cytometry was used to assess changes in the rate of apoptosis in the MKN45 and SGC7901 gastric cancer cell
lines with transient fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) knock down. (A-F) Various treatments were used to demonstrate
apoptosis in both gastric cancer cell lines with various treatments. (A) MKN45 cells were treated with a negative, small interfering
control (siCtrl). PI indicates propidium iodide. (B) MKN45 cells were treated with FGFR4 small interfering RNA (siRNA). (C) The
rate of apoptosis in MKN45 cells that were treated with FGFR4-siRNA obviously increased compared with the negative and
mock treatment groups. (D) SGC7901 cells were treated with a negative siCtrl. (E) SGC7901 cells were treated with FGFR4siRNA. (F) The rate of apoptosis in SGC7901 cells that were transfected with FGFR4-siRNA increased significantly compared
with the negative and mock groups. (G) Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of caspase 3 and extra-large Bcell lymphoma (Bcl-xL) (a prominent downstream effector molecule of antiapoptosis) in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells, 2 apoptosisrelated proteins, varied with different treatments. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a loading control. All data shown are representative of 3 independent experiments. Results are expressed as means  standard deviations.

indicated that cloning efficiency in the si1792 transfection
group was remarkably less than that in the negative and
mock groups, in accordance with the results from our proliferation assay.
Antiapoptotic effects often contribute to cancer cell
survival and chemoresistance of cancer cells (eg, doxorubicin resistance).20 Antiapoptotic effects have been reported
in FGFR1 and FGFR3.21,22 Recently, Roidl et al observed
that an antiapoptotic signaling pathway was initiated by
FGFR4, regulating the expression of Bcl-xL through the
mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.11 Bcl-xL, a
prominent downstream effector molecule of antiapoptosis, is up-regulated in different tumors, such as breast and
liver cancer, frequently leading to chemoresistance. In the
current study, the apoptotic rate in MKN45 and
SGC7901 cells was elevated remarkably and Bcl-xL
expression was weakened in the si1792 group compared
with the negative and mock groups. In other words, the
up-regulation of FGFR4 may contribute to an antiapop-

totic effect in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells, which is in
line with the report by Roidl et al in breast cancer cells.
Furthermore, the expression by MKN45 and SGC7901
cells of caspase 3, which is a pivotal molecule during cell
apoptosis, increased in the si1792 group compare with
expression the negative and mock groups, which may
establish more adequately the vital role of FGFR4 in regulating apoptosis. Similar results were reported from a
study in hepatocellular carcinoma in which caspase 3
expression gradually increased after an increase in the dose
of FGFR4 inhibitor.10
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this study is the
first detailed exploration of the pivotal role of FGFR4 in
the tumorigenesis and progression of gastric cancer. Our
findings demonstrate that FGFR4 expression is high in
gastric cancer tissues, that it is associated with lymph node
status and with neu and PCNA expression, and that it
appears to be related to prognosis in patients with gastric
cancer. Subgroup analysis revealed that, among patients

with gastric cancer who have high FGFR4 expression levels, those with stage III/IV disease may have a worse prognosis. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of
FGFR4 expression contributed to reducing the proliferative ability and increasing the apoptotic rate in MKN45
and SGC7901 cells with high FGFR4 expression. Consequently, we believe that FGFR4 may serve as a target for
novel therapies in patients with gastric cancer.
