ABSTRACT
Extracellular matrix components play an active role in cancer progression and
prognosis. Versican, a large extracellular matrix proteoglycan, can promote cancer
metastasis through facilitating cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.
We had previously demonstrated that amiodarone caused ectopic overexpression
of similar to versican b (s-vcanb), inhibited EGFR/GSK3β/Snail signaling, and
enhanced Cdh5 at the heart ﬁeld of zebraﬁsh, indicating interference with epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). Since S-vcanb is homologous to mammalian versican
V2 isoform, we examined the effects of amiodarone on mammalian tumor proliferation,
migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo and on EMT signaling pathways.
Monolayer wound assays and extracellular matrix transwell invasion assays showed
reduced migration and invasion by 15 μM amiodarone treated B16OVA, JC, 4T-1, MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 tumor cell lines. All cancer cell lines showed reduced metastatic
capabilities in vivo after treatment with amiodarone in experimental animals. Western
blots revealed that EMT-related transcription factors Snail and Twist were reduced and
E-cadherin was enhanced in amiodarone treated cells through an EGFR/ERK/GSK3βdependent pathway. Immunohistochemistry showed amiodarone lead to increased
expression of versican V2 isoform concomitant with reduced versican V1. Our study
illustrated the role of versican v2 in EMT modulation and cancer suppression by
amiodarone treatment.

and increased expression of several transcriptional
repressors of E-cadherin, such as Twist and Snail [5–8].
EMT in cancer stem cells has also been related to therapy
resistance [9, 10]. Extracellular matrix components (ECM)
also play an active role in tumor progression and are
important determinants for the growth and progression
of solid tumors [11]. Versican, a key ECM component, is
a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan belonging to the
lectican family [12–14]. Alternative splicing of versican
generates at least four isoforms named V0, V1, V2,
and V3. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal that Versican
modulates cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration,
and, hence, plays a central role in tissue development,
as well as a number of pathologic processes [15–17].

INTRODUCTION
Cancer metastasis is the major cause of cancerrelated mortality [1]. Discovering molecular targets
that regulate metastasis or act as predicting/prognostic
biomarkers is essential for developing effective
therapies. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and
Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) have been
thoroughly studied in mammalian development. Numerous
embryonic events and developing organs depend on the
switch between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes,
such as gastrulation [2], neural crest formation [3] and
heart valve formation [4]. EMT has been well implicated
in cancer metastasis, characterized by loss of E-cadherin

Numerous studies have reported that the V1 isoform
promotes cancer cell motility and invasion [18–20]. Both
G1 and G3 globular domains in Versican V1 promote
cell proliferation of NIH-3T3 ﬁbroblasts and tumor cells
[18, 19, 21, 22]. The Versican G1 domain is proposed
to stimulate proliferation by destabilizing cell adhesion,
while the G3 domain is proposed to induce proliferation by
the interaction of its EGF-like motifs with EGFRs [23, 24].
Recently, Du et al. [25] found that overexpression of
versican enhanced breast cancer self-renewal through
EGFR/AKT/GSK3β signaling and conferred to
chemotherapy resistance.
Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic
drug which was approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration in 1985 [26, 27]. It is considered a broadspectrum antiarrhythmic agent [28] for the treatment
of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and atrial ﬁbrillation
[29]. We previously reported that Amiodarone could
inhibit zebraﬁsh cardiac valve formation through
inducing the expression versican and chromodomainhelicase-DNA-binding protein 5 tumor suppressor
gene (cdh5; VE-cadherin) in the heart ﬁeld. These data
suggest that Amiodarone may have sufﬁcient effect to
interfere EMT processes during cardiogenesis [30]. In
this study, we demonstrated that Amiodarone caused
the ectopic expression of versican V2, conserved as
zebraﬁsh ortholog s-vcanb, and cancer growth/metastasis
inhibition through EMT modulation and suppressing
EGFR signaling.

observed functional similarity proposed that zebraﬁsh
S-Vcanb may be functionally conserved in mammalian
versican V2, we examined the expression of Versican
isoforms V1 and V2 in Amiodarone-treated cell lines
B16OVA, JC, 4T-1 and MDA-MB231 cells. After 15 μM
Amiodarone incubation for 24 hours, all treated cell lines
showed increased V2 expression compared to control
cells (Figure 2A, 2B). At the same time, V1 expression
was reduced in the Amiodarone-treated B16OVA, JC and
MDA-MB231 cells, but not in 4T-1 cells (Figure 2A, 2B).
Amiodarone induced enhanced Versican V2 expression in
2 out 3 tested cancer cell lines.

Amiodarone inhibits EGFR signaling in cancer
cells
EGFR has been identiﬁed as an oncogene [34].
Anticancer therapies with mAbs such as cetuximab, that
block the extracellular ligand binding domain prevent
signaling molecules from attaching and activating the
tyrosine kinase [35]. Therefore, we examined whether
Amiodarone regulates the migratory and invasive
phenotypes of cancer cells through EGFR pathways similar
to that found in our previous work with zebraﬁsh embryos
(submitted to Cardiovascular Research). We analyzed the
expression levels of phosphorylated EGFR, EMT markers
and EMT-related factors by Western blot analysis. Firstly, we
examined the effects of Amiodarone on the phosphorylation
of tyrosine residues in EGFR. Phospho-Tyr-845 of EGFR
is a known autophosphorylation site [36–40]. PhosphoTyr-1173 serves as one of the docking sites for the cytosolic
signaling molecule, Src homology 2 (SH2)-domaincontaining transforming protein and growth factor receptorbound protein 2 (GRB2) [41–43]. Treatment of B16OVA,
JC, 4T1 and MDA-MB231 cells with Amiodarone for
24 hr resulted in decreased EGF-induced phosphorylation
of EGFR on individual tyrosine residues (Figures 2C, 2D).
We also performed loss of function study to prove
the pathway we demonstrated in this study. We evaluated
the effect of inhibiting the kinase activity of EGFR with
tyrphostin (AG1478; Supplementary Figure S2A). Results
showed that the EGFR phosphorylations were increased
signiﬁcantly in the presence of EGF (50 ng/ml). On the
contrary, the EGFR phosphorylations were signiﬁcantly
reduced in Amiodarone (15 μM) and AG1478 (30 μM)
treated cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Cetuximab
is a chimeric (mouse/human) monoclonal antibody
which binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR with
high speciﬁcity. Therefore, we used Cetuximab, another
EGFR blocking antibody, to perform loss of function
study (Supplementary Figure S2B). Results showed that
the EGFR phosphorylation were increased signiﬁcantly
when EGF (50 ng/ml) were added. However, the EGFR
phosphorylation were reduced both in the cells treated in
either or both the presence of Amiodarone (15 μM) and
Cetuximab (75 μg /ml). The evidence presented indicates

RESULTS
Amiodarone inhibits migration and invasion of
4T-1 breast cancer cell line
We ﬁrst sought to establish that Amiodarone
mediates a functional inhibition of cell migration and
invasion using a monolayer wound healing assay.
Quantiﬁcation of cell movement over 24 and 48 hours
showed that 15 μM Amiodarone inhibited migration of
B16OVA by 34 ± 6%, JC by 63 ± 6%, and 4T-1 by 37
± 2% (Figure 1A, 1B). Cell invasion was also examined
using transwell migration assays. Amiodarone treatment
signiﬁcantly decreased the invasive capabilities in
B16OVA, JC, 4T-1 (Figure 1C) and MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 1D). The results of the transwell assay
were consistent with those of the wound-healing assay,
demonstrating that Amiodarone leads to suppression of the
invasive capabilities of melanoma and breast cancer cells.

signaling, whereas isoform V2 exhibits a biological

including rat sarcoma–MAPK kinase (MEK), extracellularrelated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
and AKT pathways. For downstream signaling, our results
showed that the total levels of AKT and ERK were unchanged
in Amiodarone-treated B16OVA, JC, 4T-1 and MDA-MB231
cells (Figure 2E, 2F). However, phosphorylated ERK and

tested cell lines (Figure 3A, 3B). Therefore, it is crucial
to determine if the repression of these EMT markers
by Amiodarone is dependent upon GSK3β activity.
Accordingly, we incubated tumor cells with a GSK3β
inhibitor, BIO, prior to treating with amiodarone and
analysis of Snail and Twist. Supplementary Figure S3
shows that 1 μM BIO restored Snail and Twist and
suppressed E-cadherin expression in amiodarone treated
cells. Therefore, our results showed that Amiodarone
repression of EMT marker expression, in particular
Snail protein, is GSK3β-dependent.

GSK3β signaling and E-cadherin expression is a
hallmark of EMT transition, an important characteristic
of metastatic potential. Amiodarone treatment indeed

marker E-cadherin increased whereas the mesenchymal
markers N-cadherin, Snail and twist decreased in all

Similarly, using siRNA to knockdown VcanV2
expression before amiodarone treatment, E-cadherin
was reduced while Snail was increased (Figure 4C).
We also demonstrated the loss of EGFR activity
inhibition by Amiodarone upon knockdown VcanV2
(Supplementary Figure S5). The role of VcanV2 in this
process was demonstrated by reduced invasion by cells
harboring the transgene for human or zebraﬁsh VcanV2
and increased invasion by cells harboring shRNAVcanV2 (Figure 4D, 4E). Taken together, we concluded
that the VcanV2-dependent effects of Amiodarone on

that the levels of pAKT and pERK were signiﬁcantly

respectively (Figure 5A, 5B). Amiodarone treatment
still repressed Snail expression in 4T-1/myr-AKT cells
(Figure 5A). In contrast, Snail level was restored in
4T-1/MEK1 cells (Figure 5A, 5B). Therefore, since the
invasive capabilities of cancer cells were restored by
MEK1, but not by myr-AKT (Figure 5C, 5D), it was

Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays
were performed to investigate the role Versican V2
plays in Amiodarone-mediated repression of EMT
markers. Overexpression of versican V2 was achieved
by transfection of 4T-1 cells with human VcanV2 or
zebraﬁsh Svcanb transgenes. Both of these transgenes
each caused increased epithelial E-cadherin expression
and decreased Snail protein expression (Figure 4A). In
contrast transfection with a loss of function transgene,
S-Vcanb-mE, failed to induce E-cadherin or reduce
Snail expression (Figure 4B). We also demonstrate
that the expressions of ERK, AKT and GSK3β, and
Twist protein level were affected in the cell lines
treated with recombinant si-Versican V2 and zS-vcanbmE. Overexpression of versican V2 was achieved by
transfection of 4T-1 cells with either human VcanV2
or zebraﬁsh S-vcanb transgenes. All these transgenes
resulted in the reduction of ERK and AKT activity due
to the decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK)
and pAKT. The protein level of Twist was reduced
as well. In contrast, cells transfected with a loss-offunction of transgene, zS-vcanb-mE, were not able
to affect the pERK, pAKT, and Twist protein levels.
Thus, we concluded that Amiodarone-mediated ectopic
expression of Versican V2 and activation of signalling

Amiodarone inhibits cancer metastasis in vivo

DISCUSSION

To determine whether this in vitro therapeutic
effect can translate to experimental metastasis in vivo,
we challenged balb/c mice with 4T-1 cells and then
orally treated with PBS (control), tamoxifen (400 mg/
kg/day) or Amiodarone (180 mg/kg/day). Mice were
euthanized at day 21 and lungs were removed for
analyses. The metastatic nodules in the excised lungs
were signiﬁcantly fewer and smaller in mice treated with
either tamoxifen or amiodarone compared to the control
animals. Metastatic extent was similar in tamoxifen and
amiodarone treated groups (Figure 5E). Western blot
analyses of VcanV1 and VcanV2 in tumor cells obtained
from the diseased lungs conﬁrmed that Amiodarone
treatment induced VcanV2 and repressed V1 in vivo
(Figure 5F). Immunohistocytochemical analyses of the
excised lung from tumor-inoculated mice conﬁrmed that
Amiodarone treatment signiﬁcantly enhanced VcanV2
and E-cadherin expressions, and suppressed VcanV1
and twist in tumor tissues (Figure 5G). Therefore,
Amiodarone treatment is able to suppress breast cancer

This is the ﬁrst report to demonstrate that
Amiodarone, a potassium channel blocker used as an antiarrhythmic drug, can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and
metastasis by inducing the VcanV2 isoform expression.
This effect is accompanied by down-regulating EGFR
signaling through ERK/GSK3β pathways. A consequence
of this EMT transition blockade is up-regulation of
E-cadherin. Overexpressed VcanV2 is the mediator, as it
binds to and inhibits the action of EGFR through its EGFlike domains (Figure 6). This scenario and its participants
are analogous to the amiodarone effects of EMT transition
block we previously observed during heart valve
development in zebraﬁsh [30]. Moreover, we performed
additional Matrigel invasion assay of dronedarone and
amiodarone. Equivalent cancer cell invasion inhibition was
shown in thess two compounds. Additionally, western blot
analysis showed that dornedarone can induced VcanV2
ectopic expression in 4T-1 cells (Supplementary Figure
S6). Therefore, iodine-free dronedarone may possibly be a
safer alternative to amiodarone.

Many studies have proved that ECM components
play an active role in tumor progression and are important
determinants for the growth and progression of solid
tumors [11]. In particular, increased expression of
Versican, which has been reported in peritumoral stromal
tissues, is correlated with histological tumor grade score,
suggesting that this protein may be a strong factor in
predicting disease relapse in lymph node-negative breast
cancer patients [44]. Moreover, the role of Versican in
modulating the loss of adhesion and cell motility has also
been recognized in cases of breast cancer metastasis [22]
or ovarian cancers [45].
Alternative splicing of Versican generates at least
four isoforms, and these isoforms play distinct roles may
due to differences in chondroitin sulfate (CS) domains
[33]. V0 contains both CSα and CSβ; V1 and V2 possess
only CSβ and CSα, respectively; and V3 contains neither
CSα nor CSβ. The CSβ domain–containing V1 isoform
can induces neuronal differentiation and promotes neurite
Outgrowth [46]. Sheng et al., [33] also report that V1
isoform is implicated in cell proliferation enhancement,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance. In contrast,
The CSα domain-containing V2 inhibits axon and neurite
growth [47] and is associated with suppression of cell
proliferation and causes inhibition of the EGFR signaling
pathway [33].
Interestingly, Versican functions not only as a
scaffold or substrate to be consumed during tumor cell
invasion, but also represents a central component of
cancer-related inﬂammation, as it can bind multiple types
of cell adhesion receptors, growth factor receptors, and
chemokines to provide a complex set of environmental cues
to inﬂammatory and cancer cells in versican-rich sites [48].
For example, Ricciardelli et al., [21] demonstrated that
prostate cancer cells in vitro could utilize the hyaluronan,
and versican, secreted by prostatic ﬁbroblasts to assemble
a pericellular matrix and promote their motility. Versican
treatment can induce ovarian cancer cell invasion
through an ECM barrier, and suggest that formation of
a CD44/hyaluronan/versican macromolecular complex
promotes the motility and invasion of ovarian cancer
cells [49, 50].

cancer cells.

Therefore, manipulation of versican expression with
relevant EGFR signaling alteration may provide novel
therapeutic mechanism against EMT process in cancer
(Figure 6). In this report, we found that Amiodarone can
induce V2 isoform expression both in vitro and in vivo.
The balance between VscanV1 and VcanV2 plays a
role in modulation tumor biology. Although VcanV1 in
JC cells was not reduced, EGFR signaling, which could
be induced by VcanV1 in all the cells types we used,
was reduced. Sheng et al. [33] proposed that VcanV1
exhibits a biological function opposed to that of VcanV2,
whereas VcanV1 is able to enhance cell proliferation and
VcanV2 inhibits cell proliferation instead, consistent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with our ﬁnding. Thus, our data suggest a new approach
for the modulation of Versican isoform synthesis for the
development of therapeutics against cancer. Additionally,
the opposing effects between VcanV1 and VcanV2,
suggest that the expression amounts of these two isoforms
may provide a suitable extracellular environment for
normal proliferation and survival of cells. However, the
intact regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. These
ﬁndings prompted us to probe more deeply into the
functions of Versican isoforms.
Accumulating evidence in recent years indicates
that various processes associated with EMT occur during

resemble those occurring in normal organ development.
Several pathways involved in the developmental
control of EMT are subverted during tumor formation
by activation of oncogenic signaling and disruption of
tumor suppressor networks [51]. Knowledge acquired
in studying EMT processes may provide new clues to
understanding the nature of invasion and metastatic
cascades. Our previous work with zebraﬁsh cardiac
valve formation revealed that amiodarone upregulated
versican, inhibited EMT transition, EGFR signaling and
increased cadherin expression [30]. In this report, our
data demonstrated that the effects of Amiodarone on
the growth inhibition of tumor cells, recapitulates the
effect on the same pathways as in zebraﬁsh embryos. In
summary, Amiodarone was shown to induce VcanV2,
the mammalian ortholog gene of zebraﬁsh s-vcanb,
resulting in the inhibition of EGFR/ERK/GSK3β/Snail
signaling and, consequently, the increase of E-cadherin,
leading to the suppression of migration, invasion, and
metastatic capabilities of breast cancer cells. Therefore,
altered EGFR signaling is pivotal for cancer cell growth,
invasion, and metastasis. Exploitation of mechanisms
to upregulate endogenous VcanV2 may provide a novel
anticancer treatment strategy through EGFR-PI3K/AKT
signaling blockade.

DMSO-treated control cells and Amiodaronetreated cells were seeded in serum-free media and were
trypsinized, and 0.1 × 106 cells plated on transwell
chambers precoated with 20 μg Matrigel. Mediumcontaining 10% FBS in the lower chamber served as
chemo-attractant. After 12/24 h, non-invading cells
were removed with cotton swabs. Invading cells were

Plasmid construction
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based in
vitro mutagenesis and transgenic assays were used to
understand whether the EGF motif of the zebraﬁsh
S-vcanb involved in Amiodarone inhibit cancer cells
metastasis. The S-vcanb EGF motif contains eight
cysteine residues that form speciﬁc disulﬁde bridges
responsible for the secondary structure of the motif. As
report by Schrijver et al. (31), eight Cystenines were
mutated to Arginine using six primer pairs to disrupt
the formation of disulﬁde bridges. These eight primers
were:s-vcanb mE P (CAC GTGGTGCAAAAGA
TGTTGCGTACCCAATGATTG), s-vcanb mE L1 (ACGTT
GTTCACCACTGTATCCAGGTTGACGTATGCGGAT),
s-vcanb mE L2 (GTGACGTTCATCAATGTCTATTTC
ACGTTGTTCACCACT), s-vcanb mE L3 (ATTACGA

was monitored by quantiﬁcation of nodules at the time
of euthanasia, typically at 3 weeks post inoculation. All
animal experiments were in accordance with a protocol
approved by the National Defense Medical Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee with ethics
approval number: IAUCU-13-123.

Fresh breast tumor tissue was immediately placed
in formalin ﬁxative and parafﬁn embedded. Four-tosix-micrometer sections were cut from the tissue blocks
and mounted on charged slides. The sections were deparafﬁnized with xylene and ethanol and subjected to
heat-induced epitope retrieval by pressure cooker. After
washing with Tris-Buffered-Saline (TBS) containing
0.025% Triton X-100, the sections were blocked with 10%
goat serum and incubated with primary antibodies against
VcanV1, VcanV2, Ecadherin and Twist in TBS containing
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight. The sections
were washed and labeled with biotinylated secondary
antibody, followed by avidin conjugated horse–radish
peroxidase provided by the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector,
PK-4000). The staining was developed by DAB kit
(Vector, SK-4100). The slides were subsequently stained
with Mayer’s Hematoxylin for counter staining followed
by slide mounting.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SD of three
independent experiments. Differences were analyzed by
Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.005
indicated the levels of signiﬁcant difference.

(TSGH-C102-045 and TSGH-C103-046; M.S.D.).

MTT assay and amiodarone dose optimization
Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 per well in
96-well plates and incubated for 12–16 h to allow cells to
adhere. After 24 h, 0.5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)
-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was
added, and the cells were incubated for 4 h. After incubation,
100 μl of 10% SDS/ 0.01N HCl solution were added to each
well, followed by shaking for 5 min. Then, the absorbance
was measured at 570 nm. Results are representative of
three independent experiments, each done in quintuplicate.
Since in vitro studies have reported that Amiodarone may
be cytotoxic, we performed an MTT assay to determine the
least cytotoxic concentration of Amiodarone. Amiodarone
was tested at concentrations ranging from 5 to 30 μM. 15
μM was the highest concentration at which all three cell
lines tested maintained viability (Supplementary Figure S1).
Therefore, 24 hr treatment with 15 μM Amiodarone was
used throughout the subsequent cell based, in vitro studies
experiments. For other drug treatments, 20 or 50 mg/ml
EGF (Peprotech) or (2′Z, 3′E)-6-bromoindirubin -3′-oxime
(BIO; 1 μM; EMD Biosciences) were treated with cells for
1 hr, wash out by PBS buffer several times and then for
further experiments. AG-1478 (30 uM; Merck), Cetuximab
(75 μg/ml; 32; Merck) and Dronedarone (5 μM; Sigma)
were treated with cells for 24 hr.
