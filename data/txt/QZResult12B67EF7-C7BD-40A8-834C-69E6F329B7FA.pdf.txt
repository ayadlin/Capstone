BACKGROUND: Previously, early results were reported for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after nonmyeloablative
conditioning with 2 Gy of total body irradiation with or without fludarabine and/or rituximab in 33 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). METHODS: This study examined the outcomes of 70 patients with MCL and included extended follow-up (median,
10 years) for the 33 initial patients. Grafts were obtained from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched, related donors (47%), unrelated donors (41%), and HLA antigen–mismatched donors (11%). RESULTS: The 5-year incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 28%. The
relapse rate was 26%. The 5-year rates of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 55% and 46%, respectively.
The 10-year rates of OS and PFS were 44% and 41%, respectively. Eighty percent of surviving patients were off immunosuppression at
the last follow-up. The presence of relapsed or refractory disease at the time of HCT predicted a higher rate of relapse (hazard ratio
[HR], 2.94; P 5 .05). Despite this, OS rates at 5 (51% vs 58%) and 10 years (43% vs 45%) were comparable between those with
relapsed/refractory disease and those undergoing transplantation with partial or complete remission. A high-risk cytomegalovirus
(CMV) status was the only independent predictor of worse OS (HR, 2.32; P 5 .02). A high-risk CMV status and a low CD3 dose predicted PFS (HR, 2.22; P 5 .03). CONCLUSIONS: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT provides a long-term survival benefit for patients

INTRODUCTION
Despite recent progress in conventional treatment,1,2 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains
the only potentially curative treatment option for patients
with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Initially, allogeneic
HCT was attempted in these patients with high-dose
myeloablative regimens,3-6 but concerns about the relatively high risks for treatment-related mortality have limited its use to younger, medically fit patients. Given that
the median age of diagnosis with MCL is beyond the 6th
decade,7 various groups have examined the feasibility of
using reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens for patients with MCL, and results have
been encouraging.8-17 We have used a total body irradiation (TBI)–based nonmyeloablative regimen comprising
3 doses of fludarabine at 30 mg/m2 and a low dose (2 Gy)
of TBI to condition patients before allogeneic HCT. This
regimen relies on a graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect
for disease control.18 In 2004, we reported the outcomes
of the first 33 MCL patients who were treated with this
nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic HCT.8 The rates of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years were 9% and 24%, respectively,
whereas the rates of overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) were 65% and 60%, respectively. The
rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at
2 years was 64%.
Some critical questions remain. The most important is whether this presumably less toxic transplant
approach provides long-term disease control for patients
with and without active disease at the time of HCT.
Additional issues to be addressed are the likelihood that
surviving patients will experience resolution of chronic
GVHD and the identification of predictive factors for
long-term outcomes that will help to map future
improvements. To this end, we present the long-term
follow-up of the 33 initially reported patients as well as
interim follow-up of an additional 37 patients who were
treated with this nonmyeloablative regimen and allogeneic HCT at 9 participating centers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional
review boards at each institution. All patients provided
consent for their clinical information to be used in
research.
Between February 2000 and August 2012, 70 patients
with biopsy-proven MCL were enrolled on 13 Fred
3710

Hutchinson Cancer Research Center protocols for
nonmyeloablative HCT. Differences between the protocols included the use of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)–matched, related or unrelated grafts, the duration
and intensity of immunosuppressive medications, the
addition of fludarabine and/or rituximab to 2-Gy TBI,
and tandem autologous/allogeneic HCT.
MCL patients were eligible if they were <75 years of
age and either had progressed after autologous transplantation or were not eligible for autologous transplantation
because of age, comorbidities, or chemotherapy-refractory
disease. Patients were enrolled at 9 participating institutions. The institutional review boards at all sites approved
the protocols and consents.
Donor Matching, Immunosuppression, and
GVHD

Patients and their donors were evaluated for matches at
the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C antigens by
intermediate-resolution DNA typing and at HLA-DRB1
and HLA-DQB1 by high-resolution techniques.19
Post-HCT immunosuppression consisted of combinations of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) and mycophenolate mofetil with or without
rapamycin (Table 1). Types and grades of acute and
chronic GVHD were determined with previously described
methods.20,21
Definitions

Bulky lymphadenopathy was defined as having at least
1 lymph node  5 cm at the time of the pretransplant
evaluation. Comorbidities were evaluated per the HCT
comorbidity index.22 The cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology status was classified as high-risk (all patients who had
a positive status), intermediate-risk (patients who had a
negative status but their donors had a positive status), or
low-risk (both patients and donors had a negative status).
A partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% reduction
in measurable disease (nodal masses or sum of the product
of the diameters of any nodules in the spleen or liver) by
computed tomography imaging.23 A complete response
(CR) was defined as no measurable disease by computed
tomography imaging,23 bone marrow morphology, and/
or endoscopy. Refractory disease included responses less
than a PR after the most recent attempt at cytoreduction.
Untreated relapse included disease recurring after the
achievement of at least a PR after the most recent therapy.
Statistical Methods

OS and PFS were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
method. PFS was defined as the time free of progression,

and relapse. NRM and progression were the components
of PFS and were treated as competing events.
Proportional hazards models were created to test
associations between risk factors and outcomes. Variables
tested for an association with OS, PFS, relapse, and NRM
included the following: disease status at the time of transplant, bulky lymph nodes at the time of transplant, number of treatment regimens before HCT, donor type
(related vs unrelated), receipt of a 1 antigen–mismatched
graft, CMV risk status, age  55 years, HCT comorbidity
index score, CD34 cell dose, CD3 cell dose, and time
from diagnosis to HCT (>3 years vs  3 years). All variables achieving an effect with a P value < .1 were included
in multivariate models. Multivariate P values were based
on adjustments for all other variables in the model. P values were derived from likelihood ratio statistics and were
2-sided.

Patient Characteristics

Table 1 demonstrates the characteristics of the patient
population. The median age was 57 years (range, 32-75
years). The majority of the patients were male (76%).
Patients received a conditioning regimen of 2-Gy TBI
alone (14%) or combined with fludarabine at 30 mg/m2
for 3 doses (86%). Ten percent of the patients also
received rituximab. Five patients (7%) with bulky, rapidly
progressive, refractory disease before HCT received a tandem autologous transplant followed by allogeneic HCT.
Patients received a median of 4 prior chemoimmunotherapy regimens (range, 1-10). Bulky lymphadenopathy at
the time of HCT was identified in 17% of the patients.
Twenty-eight patients (40%) were enrolled after autologous HCT failed. Unresponsive (n 5 18) or untreated
relapse (n 5 7) before HCT was encountered in 36% of
the patients.
Overall Outcomes

At the end of a median follow-up period of 7.1 years
(range, 0.2-12.8 years), a total of 34 patients were alive:
30 were in continuous remission, and 4 were alive after
salvage therapies for progression (n 5 1) or relapse (n 5
3) after HCT. These 4 patients were alive at a median of
68 months (range, 50-86 months) after the date of transplant. Three patients were salvaged by 4 weekly doses of
rituximab followed by a donor lymphocyte infusion in
one, chemotherapy and local radiation therapy in the second, and bortezomib in the third. The salvage treatment
was unknown for the fourth patient. Three patients
required HCT for a second time because of 1) graft

Overall, the cumulative incidence of NRM at 5 years
was 28%. Causes of NRM included infections (n 5 9),
GVHD (n 5 7), secondary malignancies (n 5 2), organizing/idiopathic pneumonia (n 5 2), pancreatitis (n 5 1),
heart failure (n 5 1), and an accident (n 5 1). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 26% at 5 years (Fig. 1A).
Patients with progression or relapse after allogeneic HCT
(n 5 17) had a median survival of 9.4 months after documented recurrence. Overall, after 4 years, there were 28
patients at risk of relapse. One last patient relapsed on day
1482 (4.06 years); beyond that date, 27 patients remained
at risk for relapse. The 5-year rates of OS and PFS were
55% and 46%, respectively (Fig. 1B). The cumulative
incidences of grade II and grade III or IV acute GVHD
were 33% and 20%, respectively.
Outcomes among patients for whom prior autologous HCT had failed were comparable to those experienced by the entire group. The 5-year rates of OS were

53% and 43% for those failing autologous HCT and all
patients, respectively. The figures for PFS were 30% and
27%, respectively.
Recipients of HLA-matched, related donor grafts
and recipients of HLA-matched, unrelated donor grafts
experienced 5-year OS of 60% and 51%, respectively (P
5 .08), and PFS of 54% and 40%, respectively (P 5 .07).
The figures for relapse and NRM were 22% and 28% (P

100 were 45% and 64%, respectively, whereas those for
chronic GVHD at 2 years were 58% and 57%,
respectively.
The prevalence of patients who were alive and were
tapered off all immunosuppressive medications was 30%
at 5 years (Fig. 1C). The median time to the cessation of
immunosuppressive medications was 35 months (range,
1-95 months). Among the 34 surviving patients, the median Karnofsky performance status at last contact was
90% (range, 60%-100%).

Outcomes of Nonmyeloablative HCT for MCL/Vaughn et al

No statistically significant differences were observed in
the rates of OS (51% vs 58%, P 5 .29) or PFS (35% vs
54%, P 5 .08). Notably, survival rates were overall similar
for those who were given transplants while they were suffering an untreated relapse (n 5 7) or refractory disease
(n 5 18; data are not shown).

Reported Patients

Figure 2. Cumulative incidences and rates of (A) nonrelapse
mortality and progression/relapse and (B) overall and
progression-free survival among the 33 initially reported
patients with mantle cell lymphoma who underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning.

Among the 33 initially reported patients, 14 survived with
a median follow-up of 10.3 years (range, 8.6-12.8 years).
The rate of relapse at 10 years was 18%, whereas the
cumulative incidence of NRM was 41% (Fig. 2). The
10-year rate of OS was 44%, whereas the PFS rate was
41%.
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was
65%. The prevalence of patients who were alive and were
tapered off all immunosuppressive medications was 35%
at 10 years; they constituted 80% of all surviving patients.
There were 14 patients who underwent transplantation with an unresponsive or untreated relapse, whereas
19 patients had a CR/PR. Similar to the overall population,
patients with an unresponsive/untreated relapse had statistically significantly higher rates of relapse at 10 years (36%
vs 5%, P 5 .03) versus those who had a CR/PR. No statistically significant differences could be observed between the
2 groups for NRM (29% vs 50%, P 5 .43), OS (43% vs
45%, P 5 .89), or PFS (36% vs 45%, P 5 .62).
Assessment of Prognostic Variables for
Outcomes

Comparison of Outcomes Between Patients With
Chemosensitive Relapse and Patients
With Unresponsive/Untreated Relapse Before
Allogeneic HCT

Overall, 25 patients (35.7%) underwent transplantation
while they were suffering an unresponsive/untreated
relapse, whereas 20 (28.6%) had achieved a PR, and 25
(35.7%) had achieved a CR. Patients with an unresponsive/untreated relapse were given a greater median number of prior regimens than those with a CR/PR (5 vs 3).
The rates of achieving a CR after HCT were 68%
and 75%, respectively, at a median duration of 93 days for
both groups. Patients with an unresponsive/untreated
relapse experienced a statistically significantly higher rate
of relapse at 5 years (45% vs 14%, P 5 .007) in comparison with those had a CR/PR. NRM at 5 years was less frequently encountered among patients who had an
unresponsive/untreated relapse (20% vs 33%), but this
difference did not reach statistical significance (P 5 .95).

A high-risk CMV status was the only statistically significantly independent predictor of worse OS (HR, 2.32;
P 5 .02) and PFS (HR, 2.22; P 5 .03; Table 2), but it
was not a predictor of relapse (HR, 2.59, P 5 .11 in the
multivariate analysis) or NRM (the association did not
qualify for entry into the multivariate model). A low CD3
cell dose (<3 3 108/kg) was associated with a 2-fold
increase in the risks for worse OS and PFS, but these associations had only borderline statistical significance (P 5
.07 and P 5 .05, respectively).
The presence of an unresponsive or untreated relapse
at the time of HCT had borderline statistical significance
for an association with a higher risk of relapse (HR, 2.94;

with worse OS (the association did not qualify for entry
into the multivariate model) or PFS (HR, 1.64; P 5 .13).

also associated with an increased risk of post-HCT

These factors were significant at the .10 level in the univariate analysis, and they were then entered together into the multivariate model. Other factors that
were considered but did not reach the .10 level for any endpoint were as follows: age  55 years, CD34 dose < 7.8 3 106/kg, number of prior regimens  4,
failed prior autologous transplant, absolute neutrophil count < upper limit of normal (1.8), and time from diagnosis to HCT > 3 years.

examined as a time-dependent covariate, the development
of chronic GVHD was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of relapse (HR, 0.28; P 5 .17).
No factors met statistical significance for associations with higher risks of NRM, even though a low CD3
cell dose (HR, 2.54; P 5 .08) and an HCT comorbidity
index score  3 (HR, 1.71; P 5 .22) showed higher HRs
for that outcome.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown that patients with previously
treated and advanced MCL can achieve prolonged and
sustained PFS when they are treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HCT. This is a particularly important finding in our field because it showcases
the ability of the GVL effect to sustain long-term disease
control in patients with MCL. This fact is particularly
highlighted in Figure 1A, which shows that relapses
among our 70 patients plateaued after approximately
4 years. Indeed, of the 28 patients who were at risk of
relapse 4 years after HCT, only 1 experienced relapse (at
4.06 years). The remaining patients were alive and free of
disease at the time of the last follow-up. Moreover,
although chronic GVHD developed in 65% of the
patients, the majority of the survivors (80%) came off all
immunosuppressive medications with a median Karnof3714

sky performance status of 90% at last contact. Therefore,
we believe that prolonged responses are plausible without
the expense of significant long-term toxicity.
The 5-year OS among our patients was 55%. Previously reported survival rates after allogeneic HCT with
high-dose regimens were in the range of 25% to 49%,4,6
whereas those after a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
regimen were 21% to 53%.16,17 The 5-year NRM experienced by our patients was 28%. Previous results for NRM
rates after high-dose or RIC regimens ranged between 38%
and 58% and between 17% and 28%, respectively.25-28
Comparing results across sites and data sets is not possible
because of the variability in patient characteristics and regimens. Nevertheless, a subset of MCL patients seems to benefit from allogeneic HCT. Although our study provides
promising results, future prospective studies are needed to
explore which regimen is more suitable to which group of
MCL patients with a given set of characteristics.
A significant proportion of patients (37%) who had
active disease at the time of transplant were able to achieve
sustained long-term survival (5-year OS, 55%; 10-year
OS, 43%). This finding is encouraging because it suggests
that some chemorefractory disease may still respond to
the GVL effect. Outcomes after allogeneic HCT in
patients with relapsed/refractory MCL were recently
examined with registry data.25 Similar to our findings,

those results showed that a subset of patients with refractory disease experienced sustained 3-year OS (30%) and
PFS (25%) after they had been treated with RIC/nonmyeloablative conditioning. Historically, patients with refractory MCL have had dismal outcomes with traditional
treatment methods.29-31 Our results, in addition to the
registry study, support the use of allogeneic HCT as an
important salvage option for those with relapsed/refractory disease.
Significant advances have been made in treating persistent MCL after allogeneic HCT with interventions
such as donor lymphocyte infusions,17,32 maintenance
immunotherapy,33,34 novel biologic agents such as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunomodulatory
agents,35,36 and genetically modified donor chimeric antigen receptor T cells.37,38 We compared the 5- and 10-year
OS of those who received allogeneic HCT with a CR/PR
and those with a refractory/untreated relapse. The OS was
not different between these 2 groups, although the latter
group did experience a higher rate of relapse. The results
remained valid when we analyzed patients with refractory
disease separately from those with an untreated relapse at
the time of HCT, and this suggested an equal GVL benefit for the 2 groups. It is conceivable that by lowering the
toxicity profiles of the conditioning regimen, we may be
leaving room for treatment with effective salvage therapies
after HCT and thereby extending survival. Using some of
the novel approaches mentioned previously (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors or chimeric antigen receptor T
cells) may further improve the survival of those who progress or relapse after HCT.
We did attempt to identify factors that might predict which patients would derive the best outcomes from
nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT. Having a high-risk
CMV status was the only statistically significant negative
predictor of PFS and OS in our study. The relatively small
sample size was probably responsible for the study not
demonstrating a strong association between the CMV status and the risk of either relapse or NRM. The receipt of a
lower CD3 cell dose showed an association with poorer
PFS. Although again the small sample size limits our conclusions about this association, one explanation could be
related to the importance of immune reconstitution in
these patients both as a protector against subsequent infection and NRM and as the underlying mediator of the
GVL effect. Notably, receiving related grafts versus unrelated grafts did not influence outcomes in our study. This
supports the idea that unrelated donors are a suitable
option for patients with MCL lacking identical sibling
grafts. Only 7 patients received HLA antigen–misCancer

matched grafts, but this was strongly associated with an
increased risk of relapse (HR, 5.97; P 5 .004). Prolonged
durations of GVHD prophylaxis immunosuppressive
therapy as well as the use of systemic steroids to treat acute
and/or chronic GVHD (which developed in 4 of these
patients) might be in part responsible for increasing risks
of relapse. However, these results must be interpreted
with caution because of the small number of recipients of
HLA antigen–mismatched grafts.
Study limitations include the retrospective nature of
the study and the relatively small number of patients.
Nevertheless, this study had complete follow-up data with
almost no missing information even though patients were
treated at multiple academic centers. The use of a uniform
nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen in this group of
MCL patients allowed us to better reveal the real effects of
the GVL effect on disease control.
Our results confirm the ability of minimally toxic
nonmyeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic
stem cell transplantation to secure limited treatmentrelated mortality that optimizes the benefit from the
strong GVL effect. At our collaborating sites, it is becoming a standard practice to offer nonmyeloablative conditioning to all patients older than 50 years or those with
multiple comorbidities presenting with allogeneic HCT.
In the current era, only a rare group of young and healthy
patients is offered high-dose regimens because of the high
possibility of NRM. However, because there are multiple
treatment options now available for relapsed MCL,
exactly who will derive the most benefit from this form of
therapy warrants further investigation, which may be best
accomplished with multi-institutional randomized clinical trials.
