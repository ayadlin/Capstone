ing amphipathic anions. Notable substrates of MRPs include conjugates of glutathione, glucuronic acid, and sulfate, and members
of this family are, therefore, considered to be transporters of the
products of phase II of xenobiotic detoxification. MRPs are grouped
according to whether they possess two or three transmembranespanning domains (5). With respect to drug transport, the most
extensively characterized MRPs are MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 (three
membrane-spanning domains) and MRP4, MRP5, and MRP8
(two membrane-spanning domains). This structural classification
also seems to be relevant with respect to certain functional
properties. MRPs in the former group are able to confer resistance
to varying extents to natural product anticancer agents, whereas
the shorter MRPs are distinguished by their ability to confer
resistance to nucleoside-based agents. In addition, MRP4, MRP5,
and MRP8 are able to transport cyclic nucleotides—a feature that is
not shared by the larger MRPs (6, 7). Pharmacologic studies on
gene-disrupted mice have established that MRP1 and MRP4 are
able to function in vivo as resistance factors for normal tissues
(8–10) and that the latter pump, along with MRP2 and MRP3, are
involved in various aspects of drug disposition (11). Studies on
knockout mice have also suggested physiologic functions. Mrp1 has
been implicated in dendritic cell function and inflammation by
virtue of its ability to efflux leukotriene C4, Mrp3, and Mrp4 protect
cholestatic liver from endogenous compounds, such as bile acids,
and Mrp4 has been implicated in PGE2-mediated inflammatory
responses (12–16).
Recently, our laboratory reported initial functional characterizations of MRP7, an MRP family member that possesses three
membrane-spanning domains (7, 17). We found that, although
MRP7 is about equally related to C family ABC transporters
involved in the regulation of ion transport as it is to MRPs, it
nevertheless possesses features that are characteristic of MRPs.
MRP7 is competent in the transport of the canonical MRP
transport substrate E217hG but possesses little or no activity
toward a range of other substrates handled by other MRPs,
including glutathione and sulfate conjugates, bile acids, and cyclic
nucleotides (18). In addition, MRP7 is able to confer resistance to
certain natural product agents, a property that is shared by other
MRPs that have three membrane-spanning domains (19). However,
a distinctive feature of MRP7 is that it is able to confer sizable
levels of resistance to docetaxel. In addition, it is able to confer
lower levels of resistance to paclitaxel and Vinca alkaloids.
Whereas these reports provided some detail on the functional
characteristics of MRP7, the drug resistance properties of the pump
have not been completely analyzed. Here, we use a combination of
MRP7-transfected HEK293 and Pgp/Mrp1-deficient fibroblasts to
more precisely define the MRP7 drug resistance profile. It is shown
that, unlike other large members of the MRP family, MRP7 is able
to confer resistance to nucleoside-based agents. In addition, the
resistance activity of the pump extends to a wider range of natural

Abstract
Multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7; ABCC10) is an ATPbinding cassette transporter which is able to transport
amphipathic anions and confer resistance to docetaxel and,
to a lesser extent, vincristine and paclitaxel. Whereas some
detail on the resistance profile of MRP7 is known, the activities of the pump have not been completely determined.
Here, it is shown by the analysis of MRP7-transfected HEK293
cells that, in addition to natural product agents, MRP7 is also
able to confer resistance to nucleoside-based agents, such as
the anticancer agents cytarabine (Ara-C) and gemcitabine,
and the antiviral agents 2¶,3¶-dideoxycytidine and PMEA. Consistent with the operation of an efflux pump, expression of
MRP7 reduced the accumulation of Ara-C and PMEA. In
addition, MRP7 is also able to confer resistance to the microtubule-stabilizing agent epothilone B. Ectopic expression of
MRP7 in mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in P-glycoprotein
and Mrp1 revealed that MRP7 has a broad resistance profile for natural product agents. In this drug-sensitive cellular
background, MRP7 conferred high levels of resistance to
docetaxel (46-fold), paclitaxel (116-fold), SN-38 (65-fold),
daunorubicin (7.5-fold), etoposide (11-fold), and vincristine
(56-fold). Buthionine sulfoximine did not attenuate MRP7conferred resistance to docetaxel or Ara-C. These experiments
indicate that the resistance capabilities of MRP7 include
nucleoside-based agents and a range of natural product
anticancer agents that includes nontaxane antimicrotubule
agents that are not susceptible to P-glycoprotein–mediated
transport and that, unlike MRP1 and MRP2, MRP7-mediated
drug transport does not involve glutathione. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a major
obstacle to cancer treatment. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are involved in resistance by virtue of their ability to
extrude drugs from the cell (1, 2). Many of the ABC transporters
that function as drug efflux pumps are termed multidrug resistance
proteins (MRP) and reside in the C family of ABC transporters—
one of the largest families of ABC transporters (3, 4). The MRP
family is composed of nine members, eight of which have been
characterized and established as having the facility for transport-

3.1 MRP7 (18) and inserting it into the Not1 and EcoR1 sites of PVL1392
(Pharmingen). MRP7 baculovirus was generated using BacVector 3000
(Invitrogen).
Immunoblot analysis. Monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and
incubated on ice for 20 min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
containing 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 5 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L
phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were passed through a syringe and
then centrifuged in a cold microfuge for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. Proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE on 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose filters using a wet transfer system, as previously described
(22, 23). MRP7 was detected using anti-MRP7 monoclonal antibody (1:10) in
conjunction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled goat anti-mouse
IgG (NEN) used at a dilution of 1:2,500. h-Actin–HRP conjugated antibody
was used at a dilution of 1:5,000 (Abcam) Membrane vesicles were prepared
by the nitrogen cavitation method as described previously (24).
Drug sensitivity assays. Drug sensitivity was analyzed using a 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt/phenazine methosulfate (MTS/PMS) microtiter plate
assay (CellTiter 96 Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega). HEK-pcDNA3, HEKMRP7-C17, and HEK293-MRP7-C18 were seeded in triplicate at 3,000 cells
per well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Parental vectortransduced MEF3.8 cells (TKO-pBabe) and MRP7-transduced MEF3.8 cells
(TKO-MRP7-7-21) were seeded at 1,500 cells per well in 10% DMEM. All other
cell lines were seeded at 3,000 cells per well in 10% DMEM. The following day,
drugs were added at various concentrations to the growth medium. Cellular
proliferation assays were performed after 72 h of incubation in the presence of
drug. Vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, daunorubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluoro-2¶deoxyuridine, 5-fluoro-5¶-deoxyuridine, 5-azacytidine, 5-fluorouracil,
6-thioguanine, 2¶-chloro-2¶ deoxythymidine, 2¶,3¶-dideoxycytidine, cytabarine,
6-mercaptopurine and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from

products agents than previously suspected. Notably, MRP7 is also
able to confer resistance to epothilone B, a class of natural product
agents that are not known to be susceptible to transport by other
drug efflux pumps.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, plasmids and transfection. The generation of HEK293
clones stably transfected with MRP7 expression vector (HEK-MRP7-C17
and HEK-MRP7-C18) and parental vector-transfected control cells
(HEK293-pcDNA) was previously described (18). Triple knockout (TKO)
Mrp1/,Mdr1a/b/ fibroblasts (MEF3.8 cells) were kindly provided by
Dr. Alfred Schinkel (20, 21). HEK293 cells, NIH/3T3 cells, and MEF3.8 cells
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
The MEF3.8 cells required the same medium with the addition of 2.5 Ag/mL
puromycin to maintain MRP7 expression. The MDCKII cells were grown
in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. A vector for
expression of MRP7 in Mrp1/,Mdr1a,b/ mouse embryo fibroblasts
was prepared by excising the cDNA insert encoding MRP7 from pcDNA 3.1
MRP7 (18) using SnaB and inserting it into the SnaB site of retroviral
vector pBabe(puro) to create pBabe(puro)-MRP7. Phoenix retroviral
packaging cells were transfected with pBabe(puro)-MRP7 or parental vector
and harvested retroviral particles were used to transduce Mrp1/,
Mdr1a,b/ fibroblasts. After 48 h, the cells were passaged, and stable
clones were selected in 2.5 Ag/mL puromycin. MRP7 overexpressing clones
were identified by immunoblotting. A vector for expression of MRP7 in
baculovirus was prepared by excising the MRP7 cDNA insert from pcDNA

Sigma Chemical Company. SN-38 was generously provided by Pharmacia
Corporation. Etoposide (Bristol Meyers Squibb), gemcitabine (Eli Lilly), and
docetaxel (Aventis Pharmaceuticals) were obtained from the pharmacy of the
Fox Chase Cancer Center. MAC231, MST997, and HTI286 were kindly
provided by Wyeth Research. Epothilone B, epothilone A, and phomopsin A
were obtained from Calbiochem. PMEA [9-(2-phosphonylmethoxynyl)adenine] was kindly provided by Gilead.
Drug accumulation assays. For PMEA accumulation, control HEKpcDNA cells and HEK-MRP7-C18 cells were seeded in triplicate at 3  105
cells per well in 24-well dishes. On the next day, [3H]bis-pom PMEA
(3.0 Ci/mmol, Moravek) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 Amol/L,
and the cells were incubated at 37jC. At various time points, the cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and trypsinized. An aliquot of cells was used
to determine the cell number, and the remaining cells were pelleted at 4jC
and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Radioactivity was measured by the use
of a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Company, Inc.).
For cytarabine (Ara-C) accumulation, TKO-pBabe and TKO-MRP7-7-21 cells
were seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates at 3  105 per well, whereas HEKpcDNA and HEK-MRP7-C18 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5  105
per well. After overnight incubation, [3H]Ara-C (24 Ci/mmol; Moravek) was
added to a final concentration of 0.1 Amol/L, and the cells were incubated
at 37jC for various times. The cells were trypsinized, collected by
centrifugation at 2,000  rpm for 5 min, washed thrice with ice-cold PBS,
and lysed in 10 mmol/L lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS (pH 7.4)].
Lysates were placed in scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was measured
in a Packard TRI-CARB 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer.
Generation of MRP7 monoclonal antibody. A cDNA fragment
encoding amino acids 890-894 of MRP7 (17) was inserted downstream of
the glutathione S-transferase coding sequence in the pGEX-2T prokaryotic
expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). The fusion protein was isolated
by electroelution from a preparative SDS-PAGE gel. Immunization of five
BALB/c mice, splenic fusion, and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays
were performed, as described previously (25). For enzyme-linked immu-

infected with MRP7 baculovirus were used to coat 96-well dishes.
Hybridoma preparation was accomplished by the Fox Chase Cancer Center
hybridoma facility.
Measurement of cellular glutathione concentrations. Subconfluent
cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, and
washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 5% metaphosphoric acid
and sonicated. The suspensions were then pelleted to remove cellular
debris, and 200 AL of the supernatant were removed for the determination
of glutathione levels. Analysis of glutathione was accomplished using a
BIOXYTECH GSH-400 kit (Oxis International), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To determine the effect of BSO on intracellular glutathione concentrations, the cells were grown overnight with 50 Amol/L
BSO before harvesting.

Results
Having determined in a previous study involving natural product
agents that MRP7 is able to confer resistance to microtubule active
agents, such as taxanes and Vinca alkaloids (19), we sought to
extend our characterization of the pump by defining its capabilities
with respect to another important class of anticancer agents—
nucleoside analogues. To investigate this, the sensitivities of two
previously described clones of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells and
parental vector-transfected control cells were analyzed. A range of
anticancer nucleoside analogues (gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines,
5 Aza, Ara-C, and CDA) and nucleobase analogues [6-thioguanine
(6-TG), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)] were examined. As shown in
Table 1, increased resistance was observed for gemcitabine and
Ara-C, for which the MRP7-transfected cells exhibited 2.8-fold to
3.0-fold and 4.6-fold to 8.5-fold levels of resistance, respectively.

MRP7 Confers Resistance to Epothilone B

Supplementary Table S1, treatment of MRP7-transfected HEK293
cells with 50 Amol/L BSO did not affect resistance toward either
docetaxel or Ara-C. Under these conditions, cellular glutathione
levels were depressed by f84%, a marked reduction (2.06 F 0.04

Low levels of resistance toward 5-Aza (2.0-fold) and 5-fluoro-2¶deoxyuridine (5-FdUrd; 1.6-fold) were observed for HEK-MRP7-C17
and HEK-MRP7-C18, respectively. In addition, resistance toward
two antiviral agents, the nucleoside analogue 2¶,3¶-dideoxycytidine
(ddC) and the nucleotide analogue PMEA, was analyzed. The
MRP7-transfected cells exhibited resistance to each of these agents,
with fold resistance levels of 4.9 to 7.4 and 2.8 toward ddC and
PMEA, respectively. Representative dose-response curves for
nucleoside analogues are shown in Fig. 1A-C.
Next, the activity of MRP7 toward several microtubule active agents
that are currently in development was analyzed (Table 1). These
agents included the macrolides epothilones A and B (26), the
macrocyclic heptapeptide phomopsin (27), the docetaxel analogues
MAC-321 and MST-997 (28, 29), and HTI-286, an analogue of the
tripeptide hemiasterlin (30). Notably, the MRP7-transfected cells
exhibited resistance toward epothilone B (5.3-fold to 6.8-fold; Fig. 1D).
In addition, low levels of resistance (1.5-fold to 2.8-fold) were observed
for HEK-MRP7-C18 toward MAC-321, MST-997, and HTI-286.
To confirm that MRP7 affects sensitivity to nucleoside analogues
by reducing cellular accumulation, the cellular kinetics of radiolabeled PMEA and Ara-C was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2, HEKMRP7-C18 exhibited reduced accumulation for each of these agents.
At 30 minutes, accumulation of PMEA was reduced by 34% compared with the control cells, and this deficit was maintained at the
60-minute time point (Fig. 2A). At 90 minutes, the accumulation
of Ara-C was reduced by 43% in MRP7-transfected cells (Fig. 2B).
To more precisely characterize the resistance activity of MRP7,
the pump was expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are
genetically deficient in Mdr1a/1b and Mrp1. The absence of these
two pumps renders the cells sensitive to drug substrates of
the latter pumps (21, 31) and, thus, provides a cellular background
that affords a clearer picture of the activity of ectopically expressed
resistance factors. Figure 3A shows the ectopic expression of MRP7
in Mdr1a/1b, Mrp1-deficient MEF3.8 mouse embryo fibroblasts. In
this cellular background, MRP7 exhibited robust activity toward
almost all of the natural product agents tested. Notably, resistance
was observed toward agents for which activity was not apparent in
the HEK293 cellular background, such as SN-38, daunorubicin, and
etoposide (Table 2; for comparison, our previously reported results
using MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells are provided in parentheses
in the last column). Particularly high resistance levels were
exhibited by TKO-MRP7-7-21 for paclitaxel, docetaxel, SN-38 (the
active metabolite of irinotecan), and vincristine (116-fold, 46-fold,
65-fold, and 56-fold resistance, respectively). TKO-MRP7-7-21 was
also resistant to etoposide (11-fold) and daunorubicin (7.5-fold). By
contrast with these agents, the levels of resistance observed for
epothilone B, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Ara-C, and
cisplatin (CDDP) were roughly comparable with the levels observed
for MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells (Table 2). Analysis of a second
MEF3.8 transfectant, which expressed lower levels of MRP7
compared with TKO-MRP7-7-21, revealed resistance levels of 14fold to paclitaxel, 12-fold to docetaxel, 23-fold to vincristine, 29-fold
to SN-38, and 6.4-fold to epothilone B (data not shown). As
expected, when cellular kinetics was analyzed in TKO-MRP7-7-21
cells using radiolabeled Ara-C as a probe, reduced accumulation
was observed (Fig. 2C).
Glutathione has been implicated in the transport of natural
product agents by MRP1 and MRP2 (32–34). To evaluate this
feature of MRP7, the ability of BSO, an agent that depresses cellular
glutathione levels by inhibiting the rate-limiting step in glutathione
synthesis, to inhibit resistance was assessed. As shown in

and 1.73 F 0.28 nmol/106 cells in the presence of BSO glutathione
levels compared with 12.4 F 0.39 and 11.4 F 0.16 nmol/106 cells in
the absence of BSO glutathione levels, respectively, for HEK-pcDNA3
and HEK-MRP7-C18 cells). Activity toward docetaxel is a prominent
feature of the MRP7 resistance profile. To determine whether other
MRP family members that confer resistance to natural product
drugs could also transport docetaxel, MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3transfected cells were tested. Resistance activity toward docetaxel
was not detected for these efflux pumps (Supplementary Table S2).

agent with utility in pancreatic and lung cancers. This is the first
example of an MRP family member that is able to confer resistance
to either of these widely used agents. In addition, MRP7 is also able
to confer resistance to antiviral agents, such as ddC, similar to
MRP8 and PMEA, as observed with MRP4, MRP5, and MRP8. It is
likely that MRP7, which we have established as being competent in
the transport of amphipathic anions (18), effluxes the negatively
charged monophosphate metabolites of Ara-C, gemcitabine, and
ddC as opposed to the uncharged parent nucleosides. This
mechanism of resistance would be in accord with the ability, for
example, of MRP8 to transport the monophosphate of 5-FU but not
the uncharged parent nucleoside analogue (38). By contrast with
the former nucleoside analogues, PMEA is a charged nucleotide
analogue, which is likely to be a direct substrate of MRP7.
The present study also revealed that the range of MRP7 toward
natural product agents is much broader than had been previously
inferred from our prior analysis of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells
(17). Confirming our previous reported findings, we show that
expression of MRP7 in the context of Pgp/Mrp1-deficient fibroblasts confers resistance to taxanes and Vinca alkaloids. However,
in this genetically deficient context, MRP7 also protected cells from
anthracyclines (daunorubicin), camptothecins (SN-38), and epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide). The ability to detect the increased
activity of MRP7 toward the former agents and the emergence of
activity toward the latter agents when the pump is expressed in
Pgp/Mrp1-deficient fibroblasts compared with HEK293 cells (Table
2) is consistent with the phenotype of MEF3.8 cells. This cell line is
reported to be 11-fold to 51-fold, 2-fold to 12-fold, 4-fold to 6-fold,
5-fold to 9-fold, and 19-fold to 41-fold more sensitive to paclitaxel,

Discussion
The present analysis of MRP7 activity provides surprising detail
on the resistance profile of the pump. In a previous study,
we focused our analysis on natural product anticancer agents
because resistance toward at least some agents of this family is
characteristic of MRP family members that possess three
membrane-spanning domains. However, the relatively low degree
of similarity between MRP7 and other MRP family members raised
the possibility that its activity might not be restricted to natural
product agents. By investigating this conjecture, we determined
that the MRP7 resistance profile includes nucleoside-based agents,
a class of compounds which are not known to be components of
the resistance profiles of other large members of the MRP family
but instead are agents toward which the small members, such as
MRP4, MRP5, and MRP8, have activity (35–38). The nucleosidebased agents toward which MRP7 is able to confer resistance
included anticancer agents, such as Ara-C, a mainstay in the
treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, and gemcitabine, an

resistance to the taxane analogues MAC-321 and MST-997, and the
microtubule-destabilizing agents phomoposin A and HTI-286.
Another feature of MRP7 that was investigated in this study is
the involvement of glutathione in MRP7-mediated resistance. The
finding that BSO had no effect on resistance to docetaxel or Ara-C
suggests that transport of anticancer agents by MRP7 does not
require glutathione. This finding, in combination with the
observations that glutathione levels are not significantly decreased
in MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells (19) or MRP7-transfected
MEF3.8 cells (present study), suggests that glutathione is not a
substrate of MRP7. In this regard, MRP7 is distinct from MRP1 and
MRP2, both of which require glutathione for transport of natural
product agents and are competent in the transport of this
tripeptide (3). Instead, MRP7 is similar to MRP3, which seems to
transport etoposide in a glutathione-independent fashion (42). We
also show in the present study that, in apparent contrast to MRP7,
all three of the latter pumps are unable to confer resistance to
docetaxel. However, with respect to MRP3, in contrast to studies
using MRP3-transfected HEK293 cells, ovarian cancer 2008 cells,
and P-glycoprotein and Mrp1-deficient MEF cells (42–44), a recent
report found that when expressed in a breast cancer cell line MRP3
is able to confer resistance to paclitaxel (45). This suggests that the
activity of MRP3 may depend on cell context. Therefore, with
regard to the activity of MRP3 toward docetaxel, further studies are
warranted using additional cell lines to the HEK293 cells used here.
To better understand the potential effect of MRP7 on the
sensitivity of normal tissues and tumors, detailed information will
be needed on the protein expression pattern of the pump. Our
laboratory and others have detected MRP7 transcript in a variety of
tissues, including pancreas, liver, placenta, kidney, brain, ovary,
spleen, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, intestine, prostate, and WBC,
as well as in various fetal tissues (refs. 17, 46; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Transcript has also been detected in several adenocarcinomas,
including tumors, such as breast, ovary, and lung (46, 47). This is of

docetaxel, SN-38, daunorubucin, etoposide, and vincristine, respectively, compared with wild-type fibroblasts (21). The lack of
significant enhancement of MRP7 activity for nucleoside analogues,
such as Ara-C, and the alkylating agent cisplatin in Pgp/Mrp1deficient cells compared with HEK293 cells is also consistent with
the absence of sensitization of MEF3.8 cells toward these two
agents (0.8-fold to 1.5-fold and 0.6-fold to 1.3-fold, respectively).
That MRP7 activity (e.g., docetaxel) is enhanced in MEF3.8 cells
toward agents for which this cell line is sensitized whereas its
activity (e.g., Ara-C) is not increased toward agents for which
MEF3.8 cells are not sensitized tends to support the validity of the
MRP7 phenotype we describe here.
Our previous study disclosed that MRP7 is able to confer
resistance to two classes of agents that target microtubules (Vinca
alkaloids and taxanes). It was, therefore, of interest to determine if
MRP7 might also confer resistance to newer antimicrotubule
agents. A notable feature of MRP7 that emerged from this line of
investigation is that it is able to confer resistance to epothilone B.
Of the nontaxane microtubule-stabilizing agents that are in clinical
development, epothilones are the most advanced (39–41). Epothilones, which have broad antitumor activity, are considered to be
particularly attractive agents because they are not susceptible
in vitro or in vivo to transport by P-glycoprotein or any previously
tested drug efflux pumps (39). In accord with this situation, the
absence of enhanced levels of MRP7-conferred resistance toward
epothilone B in the MEF3.8 system compared with HEK293 cells is
expected, in that MEFs that are deficient in P-glycoprotein and
MRP1 should not be rendered sensitive to this agent. The finding
that MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells are resistant to epothilone B
indicates that there is at least one pump capable of effluxing this
agent. By contrast with epothilone B, we did not detect resistance
toward epothilone A, which differs from the former compound by
the absence of a methyl group at C12. In addition, MRP7transfected HEK293 cells exhibited either relatively modest or no

potential interest in that the latter tumors are treated with taxanes.
In addition, MRP7 may be induced by anticancer agents toward
which the pump confers resistance. MRP7 transcript and protein
were reported to be induced by vincristine exposure in two salivary
gland adenocarcinoma cell lines that are cross-resistant to
docetaxel (48), and transcript was reported to be increased in
MCF7 cells by exposure to doxorubicin (46). In addition, it was
recently reported that MRP7 is induced by paclitaxel in a non–small
cell lung cancer cell line (49). MRP7 antibodies and an Mrp7 gene-
