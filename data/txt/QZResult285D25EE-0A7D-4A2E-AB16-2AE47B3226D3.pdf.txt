Abstract

Author Manuscript

For the past decade, docetaxel has remained the global standard of care for frontline treatment of
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Until recently, there were limited options
for patients with mCRPC following docetaxel failure or resistance, but now the approved treatment
choices for these patients have expanded to include abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel and
enzalutamide. Additionally, the radioactive therapeutic agent radium-223 dichloride has been
recently approved in patients with CRPC with bone metastases. Although each of these agents has
been shown to convey significant survival benefit as a monotherapy, preclinical findings suggest
that combining such innovative strategies with traditional treatments may achieve additive or
synergistic effects, further augmenting patient benefit. This review will discuss the transformation
of the post-docetaxel space in mCRPC, highlighting the spectrum of newly approved agents in this
setting in the USA and the European Union, as well as summarizing treatments with nonchemotherapeutic mechanisms of action that have demonstrated promising results in recent phase
3 trials. Lastly, this review will address the potential of combinatorial regimens in mCRPC,
including the pairing of novel immunotherapeutic approaches with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or
androgen ablation.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer afflicting men in the Western world and
represents the sixth leading cause of male cancer-related deaths worldwide.1 As such, an
imperative goal of therapy for prostate cancer is prolonging overall survival (OS).

Author Manuscript

Until 2010, docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with prednisone remained the
established standard of care for patients with metastatic disease,2,3 with limited options for
patients following docetaxel failure. However, studies are revealing new ways to treat
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), including disease that has
progressed on docetaxel therapy. These alternatives not only include novel approaches with
traditional modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) but also encompass
further suppression of androgen signaling through alternative pathways and leveraging the
immune system to promote an antitumor immune response.
As a result, the treatment paradigm for mCRPC is rapidly evolving in the USA and the
European Union, and the nature of this evolution is transforming the timing of docetaxel
therapy, the population that receives docetaxel, and the treatment choices for patients who
progress after docetaxel therapy. This review will discuss the transformation of the treatment
space for mCRPC from both US and EU perspectives, highlighting the spectrum of newly
approved and investigational agents in both regions. It will also address the potential of
combinatorial regimens in mCRPC, including pairings of novel immunotherapeutic
strategies with traditional approaches such as chemotherapy, RT or androgen ablation.
Background: disease state and treatment paradigm

Author Manuscript

RT and prostatectomy are potentially curative for early-stage prostate cancer.4 However, for
patients with later-stage disease and those who progress following definitive therapy,
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is used for disease control.2,5 The majority of patients
are initially sensitive to ADT, but most tumors eventually become resistant to primary
hormone therapy within a median time of 14–30 months.6 The efficacy of ADT is affected
by several disease characteristics, including lower biopsy Gleason score, the absence of
metastases and lower serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at initiation of ADT.7

Author Manuscript

Patients with prostate cancer that has progressed despite castrate levels of testosterone (<50
ng/ml), that is, CRPC,8 may expect a survival timeframe of 12–22 months from the time of
progression.9,10 Initially, many patients with mCRPC may be asymptomatic or have mild
symptoms. Commonly, prostate cancer metastasizes to bone, which is associated with
symptoms of pain and skeletal-related events, including fracture or spinal compression.5
Palliation of bone metastases, along with prolongation of survival, remain key goals in the
treatment of mCRPC.5
Historically, mCRPC was thought to be ‘hormone-insensitive,’ and chemotherapy with
docetaxel and prednisone was the gold standard for more than a decade.2,3 When compared
with mitoxantrone-based regimens, docetaxel-based regimens increased median OS to
∼16.5–19 months in patients with mCRPC.11–13 Although ∼50% of all men with mCRPC
respond to docetaxel with reductions in PSA levels, the majority of responders ultimately

develop resistance to this treatment.14 In fact, it has been reported that ∼70% of patients
have progressive disease, as measured by rising PSA levels or by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), either during or within 3 months of completing
docetaxel treatment.15 The clinical challenge is when to start chemotherapy. For example, a
patient with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic disease who would rather delay treatment
until significant symptoms arise may risk less efficacious treatment outcomes due to more
advanced disease. Docetaxel is associated with significant toxicity, which limits its use in
mCRPC to instances in which the clinical benefit outweighs the adverse event (AE) profile
(for example, rapidly progressing or symptomatic disease).11,12,14 Furthermore, in some
patients, treatment is contraindicated due to the presence of comorbidities. In practice, <50%
of those with progressive mCRPC receive docetaxel; therefore, there is a need for improved
first-line therapies and more options after docetaxel failure.

Author Manuscript

Recently, randomized phase 3 trials have reported statistically significant improvements in
OS in mCRPC (Table 1).11,13,15–19 These results have led to regulatory approvals of agents
including sipuleucel-T (Provenge, Dendreon, Seattle, WA, USA),20 abiraterone acetate
(Zytiga, Jannsen Biotech, Horsham, PA, USA),21,22 cabazitaxel (Jevtana, Sanofi-Aventis,
Bridgewater, NJ, USA, and Sanofi-Aventis Groupe, Paris, France),23,24 enzalutamide
(Xtandi, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL, USA),25 and radium-223 dichloride
(Xofigo; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Wayne, NJ, USA)26 in the USA and/or the
European Union.
Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer

Author Manuscript

The immune system has an important role in the development of tumors, as evidenced, in
part, by preclinical research showing that tumors are more aggressive when immune
function is impaired. Tumors grow more rapidly in immunodeficient mice relative to
controls, especially in those with deficiencies in the development or function of CD8+
cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells or natural killer (NK) cells.27 Furthermore, tumor
infiltration by T cells and NK cells has been shown to improve the prognosis of patients
across tumor types.28

Author Manuscript

Through a process known as ‘immunosurveillance,’ the immune system can recognize and
eradicate precursors of cancer before they become clinically apparent.29 The tumor can be
completely eradicated or a state of equilibrium may be achieved between tumor immunity
and tumor growth, whereby tumor growth is controlled. Unfortunately, for some, the
presence of tumor cells that can avoid, resist or suppress the natural immune response may
shift the equilibrium toward tumor growth.30 Tumors escape the immune system by a
number of mechanisms, including the secretion of immunosuppressive factors such as
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which inhibits an antitumor immune response, or the
recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the tumor
microenvironment, either of which can suppress the activity of cytotoxic T cells.27
Treatments that target the immune system to enhance antitumor immunity may provide
clinical benefit in cancer patients and allow the long-term suppression of tumor growth. Key
approaches include vaccine therapy using peptide-based or dendritic cell-based strategies, or
adoptive cell transfer therapy. Additionally, an understanding of the pathways that regulate

antitumor immune responses has led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors as
an alternative approach to treatment.30 The approval of sipuleucel-T for mCRPC provided
proof of concept that immunotherapeutic approaches are a viable treatment option in this
setting, with encouraging results from clinical trials of Prostvac (Bavarian Nordic,
Kvistgård, Denmark), a cancer vaccine, and ipilimumab (Yervoy, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Princeton, NJ, USA, and Bristol-Myers Squibb S.r.l., Anagni, Italy),31,32 an immune
checkpoint inhibitor, providing further supporting evidence.

Newly Approved Agents for mCRPC
First-line treatment

Author Manuscript

Approvals of sipuleucel-T, an autologous cellular immunotherapy product, and abiraterone
acetate, an oral prodrug that blocks CYP17, provide oncologists in the USA with alternative
options to first-line docetaxel.20,21 More recently, abiraterone acetate was also approved by
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the chemotherapy-naive population.22

Author Manuscript

Sipuleucel-T is generated from a patient's own peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which
are then activated ex vivo with a recombinant fusion protein comprising granulocyte/
macrophage colony-stimulating factor and prostatic acid phosphatase.10 This active cellular
immunotherapy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 as a
first-line treatment option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
mCRPC,2,20 making it the first immunotherapy to receive regulatory approval for this tumor
type. The approval was based on results of the phase 3 IMPACT trial, which randomized
patients to either sipuleucel-T (n = 341) or placebo (n = 171) administered intravenously
every 2 weeks, for a total of three infusions.10 A significant survival benefit was
demonstrated in the patients treated with sipuleucel-T relative to those in the placebo group
(25.8 months vs 21.7 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.61–0.98; P = 0.03); furthermore, a greater improvement in the 36-month
survival rate (31 vs 23%, respectively) was evident in the sipuleucel-T arm compared with
the placebo group.10 AEs occurring more frequently with sipuleucel-T than placebo
included chills (54.1 vs 12.5%, respectively), pyrexia (29.3 vs 13.7%, respectively) and
headache (16 vs 4.8%, respectively).10

Author Manuscript

The IMPACT trial reported an OS benefit that was observed despite no significant
differences in measurements of disease progression.10 The authors surmised that this was
attributable to delayed tumor responses, as observed with this and other immunotherapies in
various tumor types, possibly due to the time required to activate the immune system against
the tumor.10,30 Recent immunological data showed a correlation between peripheral blood
immune responses to the fusion protein and OS that is consistent with the proposed
immunological mechanism of action.33
Abiraterone acetate blocks CYP17, a critical enzyme in testosterone synthesis.17 Although
initially approved in the post-chemotherapy setting, approval of abiraterone acetate in
chemotherapy-naive disease came following positive results from the phase 3 COU-AA-302
trial, in which men with mCRPC who had not received docetaxel (n = 1088) and were
treated with abiraterone acetate/prednisone trended toward improved OS relative to those

who received placebo/prednisone (median not reached vs 27.2 months, respectively; HR =
0.75, 95% CI = 0.61–0.93; P = 0.01); however, the difference in OS was not statistically
significant because, at the time of analysis, the median OS end point had not yet been
reached.34 Furthermore, abiraterone acetate improved radiographic progression-free survival
(rPFS) relative to placebo (16.5 months vs 8.3 months, respectively; HR = 0.53, 95% CI =
0.45–0.62; P < 0.001).34 Fatigue, arthralgia and peripheral edema were more commonly
reported in the abiraterone acetate treatment group than in the control group; grade 3–4
mineralocorticoid-related AEs, including fluid retention (28 vs 24%), hypokalemia (17 vs
13%) and hypertension (22 vs 13%), were more frequent in patients treated with abiraterone
acetate/prednisone.34 Of note, this study differed from previous chemotherapy studies in that
progressive disease was predominantly defined as radiological progression rather than PSA
progression.11,12,34 A post hoc follow-up analysis suggested that continued treatment (≥24
months) with abiraterone acetate/prednisone may further delay disease progression and
prolong survival, with acceptable safety and tolerability.35
Post-chemotherapy treatment
In addition to the approval of sipuleucel-T and abiraterone acetate in the first-line setting,
abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel have been approved as post-chemotherapy treatment
options by both the FDA and EMA,21–24 and enzalutamide was approved in the USA.25
Each of these agents addresses the unmet need of mCRPC following docetaxel failure,
which further expands available treatment options for this malignancy.

Author Manuscript

Approval of abiraterone acetate in the post-chemotherapy setting in mCRPC came following
results from the phase 3 COU-AA-301 trial17 that showed abiraterone acetate/prednisone
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS (15.8 months vs 11.2 months;
HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.64–0.86; P < 0.0001) relative to placebo/prednisone in docetaxelpretreated patients with mCRPC (n = 1195; randomized 2:1, experimental to control).16
Median time to PSA progression (8.5 months vs 6.6 months, respectively; P < 0.0001),
median rPFS (5.6 months vs 3.6 months, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the proportion of
patients who had a PSA response (29.5 vs 5.5%; P = 0.0001) were all superior in the
abiraterone group relative to the placebo group.16 As observed in COU-AA-302,
mineralocorticoid-related AEs were more frequent in the abiraterone acetate group than in
the placebo group in this study.17

Author Manuscript

Cabazitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent belonging to the taxane class of microtubule
inhibitors, was approved by US and EU regulatory agencies23,24 in the post-chemotherapy
setting following the phase 3 TROPIC study in which 755 men were randomized to receive
mitoxantrone/prednisone or cabazitaxel/prednisone.15 Cabazitaxel treatment led to a
statistically significantly longer OS in patients (15.1 months vs 12.7 months, respectively;
HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59–0.83; P < 0.0001) compared with those in the mitoxantrone
group.15 Additionally, median progression-free survival (PFS) was greater in the cabazitaxel
arm relative to the mitoxantrone arm (2.8 months vs 1.4 months, respectively; HR = 0.74,
95% CI = 0.64–0.86; P < 0.0001).15 The clinically significant grade ≥3 AEs that were more
common in the cabazitaxel than mitoxantrone arm were neutropenia (82 vs 58%,
respectively) and diarrhea (6 vs <1%, respectively).15

Enzalutamide (formerly known as MDV3100), an oral androgen receptor signaling inhibitor,
was approved by the FDA for use in docetaxel-pretreated mCRPC in August 2012,25
following positive results from the phase 3 AFFIRM trial.18 Use of enzalutamide resulted in
a 4.8-month improvement in OS relative to treatment with placebo (18.4 months vs 13.6
months, respectively; HR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.53–0.75; P < 0.001) in men with mCRPC
previously treated with docetaxel (n = 1199, randomized 2:1, respectively).18 Enzalutamide
also demonstrated superiority for key secondary end points relative to placebo, including the
proportion of patients with reduced PSA levels by ≥50% (54 vs 2%, respectively; P < 0.001),
soft-tissue response rate (29 vs 4%, respectively; P < 0.001), quality-of-life response rate (43
vs 18%, respectively; P < 0.001), time to PSA progression (8.3 months vs 3.0 months,
respectively; HR = 0.25; P < 0.001), rPFS (8.3 months vs 2.9 months, respectively; HR =
0.40; P < 0.001) and time to first skeletal-related event (16.7 months vs 13.3 months,
respectively; HR = 0.69; P < 0.001).18 AEs that were reported more frequently in the
enzalutamide group included fatigue, diarrhea and hot flashes. Additionally, seizures were
reported in five patients (0.6%) receiving enzalutamide.18 As steroids have been shown to
activate androgen receptor signaling in preclinical models, a post hoc analysis of the
AFFIRM study investigated the effects of concomitant corticosteroid use on the efficacy of
enzalutamide. Interestingly, their use resulted in reduced OS and higher rates of grade 3–4
AEs in patients treated with either enzalutamide or placebo.36
Bone-targeting RT

Author Manuscript

As discussed previously, bone is a common metastatic site in mCRPC, and bone metastases
are major contributors to morbidity and disease progression. Following the FDA's approval
of denosumab (Xgeva, Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA), a human monoclonal
antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand, for the prevention of
skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, including
mCRPC,37 additional therapeutic agents have been evaluated for their potential to positively
impact both OS and the effects of bone metastases. The alpha particle-emitting radioactive
therapeutic agent radium-223 dichloride has recently been approved by the FDA in patients
with CRPC without visceral metastatic disease and with bone metastases.26

Author Manuscript

Radium-223 dichloride was evaluated in the phase 3 ALSYMPCA trial in 921 patients with
bone metastases; half of them were chemotherapy-naive, whereas the other half had been
pretreated with chemotherapy.19,38 Patients were randomized 2:1 to radium-223 or placebo
and stratified by pretreatment status. Treatment with radium-223 dichloride demonstrated
statistically significant improvement in OS (14.9 months vs 11.3 months, respectively; HR =
0.695, 95% CI = 0.581–0.832; P = 0.00007) compared with placebo in patients.19 Safety
with radium-223 dichloride was reported as favorable, regardless of whether patients had
previous docetaxel treatment, with a low incidence of myelosuppression (grade 3–4
neutropenia in 2.2 and 0.7% and grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia in 6.3 and 2% of the
radium-223 dichloride and placebo groups, respectively).19,38 Notably, men treated with
radium-223 dichloride experienced significantly longer time to first skeletal-related event
(15.6 months vs 9.8 months, respectively; HR = 0.658, 95% CI = 0.522–0.830; P = 0.00037)
relative to placebo-treated patients.19 In addition, this trial reported that radium-233
dichloride reduced pain (50 vs 62% reported pain as an AE; radium-223 dichloride vs

placebo, respectively) and opioid use (36 vs 50%; radium-223 dichloride vs placebo,
respectively) in patients with CRPC with bone metastases.39
The introduction of each of these new agents is likely to affect the context in which
docetaxel is used. Increased use of newer therapies in the first-line setting (to the extent that
they are available in a given region) is widening the interval between progression to mCRPC
and initiation of chemotherapy or, in some cases, precludes docetaxel therapy entirely.40

Phase 3 Studies in The Post-Docetaxel Setting: Ipilimumab

Author Manuscript

Ipilimumab is being evaluated in two phase 3 studies in CRPC,41,42 one of which is in
patients with docetaxel-pretreated mCRPC (discussed in the next section).41 The evolving
treatment landscape for patients in this setting has implications for clinical trial design in the
near term, as well as for patient selection in the long run. If granted marketing authorization
following phase 3 evaluation, ipilimumab is expected to further diversify the armamentarium
of agents used in docetaxel-pretreated mCRPC beyond abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel and
enzalutamide.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Targeting immune checkpoints, such as with ipilimumab, is an immunotherapy approach
that differs from vaccines like sipuleucel-T. Rather than targeting a tumor-specific antigen to
modulate the immune system against the tumor, ipilimumab, a fully human IgG1
monoclonal antibody, binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to augment
antitumor immune responses, thus targeting the immune system itself. Ipilimumab was
approved in 2011 at a dose of 3 mg/kg for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic
melanoma by regulatory agencies in >40 countries.31,32 Notably, ipilimumab has
demonstrated OS benefit in two phase 3 trials for advanced melanoma, with 19–36% of
patients experiencing long-term (4-year) survival.43–45 In advanced melanoma, ipilimumab
has side effects that are reflective of its immune mechanism of action, which are manageable
using product-specific treatment guidelines.46,47 Furthermore, ipilimumab has shown
clinical activity in a number of early clinical trials in prostate cancer.48–50 As discussed in a
later section, ipilimumab is currently being investigated in a phase 3 study (CA184-043) in
patients with mCRPC post-docetaxel (NCT00861614) (Table 2).41,51–63 In this study,
patients receive a single dose of bone-directed RT (8 Gy), followed by either 10 mg/kg
ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses, and either ipilimumab or placebo
every 12 weeks as maintenance therapy. The primary end point of this trial is OS, while
secondary end points include PFS, pain response and safety in both arms. Accrual was
completed in 2012; this study is currently continuing to follow patients for survival.41,63
Ipilimumab is also being evaluated in patients who have not yet received docetaxel
(NCT01057810).42

Combinatorial Approaches to Treating Prostate Cancer
An improved understanding of the prostate cancer microenvironment is leading to more
efficacious therapies, both through the improved use of existing treatments and the
development of new agents. It is postulated that the most effective approaches against
mCRPC may be the combination of innovative strategies with traditional treatments, or with

each other, to achieve additive or synergistic effects.64 Such combinatorial strategies have
been the subject of clinical investigation in mCRPC both before and after the administration
of docetaxel/prednisone. Preclinical evidence has provided insight into the various
mechanisms that lead to the development of prostate cancer; these pathways are not confined
to the cancer epithelial cell but also involve the tumor microenvironment.65 Multiple
signaling pathways provide crosstalk between epithelial cells and stromal cells to promote
tumor growth and metastases, including androgen receptor signaling and immune
surveillance.66

Author Manuscript

Evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of action for taxane chemotherapies and androgen
ablation therapy has revealed the potential for interplay that could lead to clinical synergy
between these two classes of agents. Docetaxel, for example, down-regulates androgen
receptor expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the combination of
docetaxel and androgen ablation could be synergistic.67 However, androgen ablation therapy
has also been shown to augment class III β-tubulin expression, which is thought to impair
taxane therapy.68 Maturation of data from studies evaluating the combination of taxanes and
androgen ablation will clarify the situation further.
Likewise, mechanistic evaluation suggests that it may be possible to increase the effects of
immunotherapies by using them concurrently with other anticancer agents. Data suggest that
combining agents that modulate immunosuppression with approaches that favor antigenspecific immune responses may be beneficial in patients with cancer. For instance, of 144
patients with metastatic melanoma who received ipilimumab, those with antibody responses
to the cancer antigen NY-ESO-1 at baseline were more likely to experience clinical benefit
than those without an antibody response.69

Author Manuscript

As shown in Figure 1, anticancer treatments can inhibit suppressive mechanisms of tumorinduced immune tolerance, boost T- and/or B-cell responses, or stress tumor cells to increase
their immunogenicity or sensitivity to lysis.28 As such, there is great interest in exploring
potentially additive or synergistic regimens such as immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, RT
or androgen ablation, in the clinic.
Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy

Author Manuscript

The overexpression of numerous distinctive antigens on prostate cancer cells and cell lines
makes prostate cancer well suited for active immunotherapy.70 Additionally, although
chemotherapy is viewed as immunosuppressive because of its ablation of leukocytes, recent
work indicates it may also have immunomodulatory effects.28,71 Prostate tumors may
promote immune tolerance early in the disease course; as such, chemotherapy may help
overcome this hurdle of tumor-induced immune tolerance by reducing the amount of
suppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β and interleukin 6, secreted by tumor cells.28,70
Chemotherapy may also deplete Tregs and stimulate tumor-specific effector T-cell
proliferation.70,72 Furthermore, following chemotherapy-induced depletion, functional
cancer-specific lymphocytes may repopulate the tumor microenvironment via homeostatic
proliferation. In addition, preclinical data published by Brown et al.73 suggest that a key
mechanism by which homeostatic proliferation supports tumor rejection is by maintaining
and/or re-establishing T-cell responsiveness.

Preclinical studies have reported that some chemotherapeutic agents, such as docetaxel and
paclitaxel, promote specific immune cell types. For instance, docetaxel administration in
4T1-Neu mammary tumor-bearing mice selectively decreased myeloid-derived suppressor
cell, while increasing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses.74 Similar preclinical studies
reported that paclitaxel enhanced the antitumor effects of a toll-like receptor 9 agonist, while
also diminishing Tregs.75 Further research with murine tumor models suggests that
sequencing of chemotherapy and immunotherapy may be critical. A study by Garnett et al.76
found that administration of a standard dose of docetaxel following poxvirus immunizations
improved vaccine-specific immune responses in tumor-bearing mice; however,
administration of docetaxel prior to immunizations did not result in benefit.

Author Manuscript

Preclinical data suggest that CTLA-4 blockade may have synergistic antitumor activity with
chemotherapy,77–79 possibly because the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents may
provide a source of tumor antigens that are then presented to T cells by antigen-presenting
cells. CTLA-4 blockade then promotes expansion and infiltration of tumor-primed CTLs.
Additionally, chemotherapy may induce changes in tumor architecture to facilitate
penetration of immunotherapeutic agents.28,80 Interestingly, Jure-Kunkel et al.78,79 reported
that following treatment with CTLA-4 blockade and chemotherapy, some animals rejected a
subsequent tumor rechallenge, suggesting the development of a protective immune response
in certain tumor models.
Preclinical findings with immunotherapy paired with chemotherapy have translated to early
clinical trials in prostate cancer (Table 3).48,81–86 Ongoing phase 2 clinical trials in prostate
cancer in which immunotherapies are being combined with chemotherapy are shown in
Table 2.

Immunotherapy in combination with RT
Combining immunotherapy with RT treatment regimens for prostate cancer may also result
in synergy, and preliminary observations have suggested that irradiation of cancer cells can
prime an antitumor immune response.87,88 This response may occur through the uptake of
the damaged cancerous cells by antigen-presenting cells89 and subsequently the presentation
of tumor antigens to immune cells, or possibly through the induction of a more
proinflammatory microenvironment.87,90

Author Manuscript

Preclinical data also suggest that there may be synergistic antitumor activity between RT and
vaccine therapy91 or CTLA-4 blockade.92–94 For example, murine experiments by
Chakraborty et al.91 demonstrated synergy between local radiation of tumor and active
vaccine therapy. The studies used mice transgenic for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
a murine carcinoma cell line transfected with CEA. The vaccine regimen included a prime
and boost strategy using CEA-TRICOM. A single dose of 8-Gy radiation to tumors induced
upregulation of the death receptor Fas in situ for a number of days. Neither radiation at this
dose nor vaccine therapy alone was capable of inhibiting growth of 8-day established
tumors, but combining the two strategies led to a significant cure rate, and tumors exhibited
a massive infiltration of T cells. Mice cured of tumors demonstrated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell
responses specific for CEA and also revealed the induction of high levels of T-cell responses

to two other antigens (gp70 and p53) overexpressed in tumors, suggesting the presence of a
consequential antigen cascade.91
Demaria et al.94 tested the hypothesis that the combination of RT to the primary tumor and
CTLA-4 blockade can elicit antitumor immunity and thereby inhibit metastases. Using the
poorly immunogenic metastatic mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 as a model, they reported
that blockade of CTLA-4 alone or use of RT alone resulted in similar survival rates to those
of control mice. However, the combination of RT and CTLA-4 blockade in malignant mice
led to synergistic effects, resulting in a statistically significant survival advantage.94

In an important mechanistic study, Pilones et al.93 found that invariant natural killer T
(iNKT) cells, a subset with unique regulatory functions, have a critical role in regulating the
response to treatment with local RT and CTLA-4 blockade. The growth of poorly
immunogenic and vastly metastatic 4T1 mammary carcinoma primary tumors and lung
metastases was compared in wild-type and iNKT cell-deficient (iNKT –/–) mice after they
received RT and/or a monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4. The response to RT in
combination with CTLA-4 blockade was substantially increased in the absence of iNKT
cells, with 50% of iNKT –/– mice (vs none of wild-type animals) exhibiting complete tumor
regression, long-term survival or resistance to a challenge with 4T1 cells. Additionally,
tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells were greatly reduced in wild-type mice that were administered
RT plus CTLA-4 blockade.93

Author Manuscript

Most recently, Dewan et al.92 reported that fractionated RT induced an abscopal effect,
defined as tumor regression seen outside the field of RT, when used in combination with
anti-CTLA-4 antibody in two independent carcinoma mouse models. Importantly, another
study in an autochronous model of prostate cancer suggested that the timing of
immunotherapy following RT may be quite restricted, which could have implications for
future clinical development of combinatorial strategies.95

The concept of immunotherapy paired with RT has also been evaluated in clinical studies
(Table 3) and is the subject of ongoing research (Table 2). Based on the preclinical evidence
in mCRPC noted previously and antitumor responses in patients with advanced
melanoma,46,47 a phase 1/2, dose-escalation trial was conducted to evaluate the use of
ipilimumab alone or in combination with RT in patients with mCRPC, with or without prior
chemotherapy (Table 3).48 Of 50 PSA-evaluable patients in the 10 mg/kg ± RT cohort of this
trial, eight had PSA response lasting between 3 and > 13 months; furthermore, of the 28
tumor-evaluable patients receiving 10 mg/kg ± RT, 1 displayed complete response whereas 6
had stable disease.48 Encouraging results from this phase 1/2 study of ipilimumab ± RT with
or without prior docetaxel treatment, which included no dose-limiting toxicities within the
dose-limiting toxicities period, has led to phase 3 evaluation of this agent. As mentioned
previously, in the CA184-043 trial, ipilimumab is given following a single dose of RT in an
effort to prime for an initial antitumor immune response (Table 2).41,63 The results of this
trial were recentely reported (ECCO 2014); the study did not meet its primary endpoint of an
increase in overall survival, but did meet a secondary endpoint of improved progression free
survival (PFS).

As shown in Table 2, a phase 3 study is investigating the use of ProstAtak (AdV-tk +
valacyclovir), an investigational agent that kills tumor cells and elicits an antitumor vaccine
effect, in combination with standard external beam RT with or without ADT for
intermediate–high-risk localized prostate cancer (NCT01436968).61 This study has an
estimated enrollment of 700 patients and has a primary end point of disease-free survival.61
Immunotherapy in combination with androgen ablation
Evidence suggests that in aged mice, androgen ablation can result in regeneration of the
thymus and the appearance of naive T cells in the peripheral blood.96,97 In humans,
androgen ablation correlates with increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells into the prostate
gland.96,98

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Early clinical trials in prostate cancer have evaluated the use of androgen ablation with
immunotherapy agents such as Prostvac and ipilimumab (Table 3), while a number of
current phase 2 trials are examining the clinical benefit of pairing androgen ablation with
agents such as ipilimumab and sipuleucel-T, amongst others (Table 2). Of note, intriguing
preliminary data from an ongoing phase 2 trial investigating the regimen of ipilimumab with
the hormonal agent leuprolide acetate in pre-surgery prostate cancer patients found that this
combination affects T-cell responses, including a measurable increase in the frequency of T
cells expressing inducible costimulator molecules (NCT01194271).55,99 Recent results
reporting early data regarding an ongoing phase 2 trial suggest that the combination of
ipilimumab and ADT in castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients significantly increases
the frequency of T cells expressing inducible costimulator (ICOS), as well as the levels of
memory T-cell markers (NCT01377389).56,100 Additionally, preliminary results from a
phase 2 sequencing trial with sipuleucel-T and ADT in men with biochemically recurrent
prostate cancer suggest that tumor-specific T-cell responses and immune responses are
augmented when sipuleucel-T is given after rather than prior to ADT (NCT01431391).57,101
Follow-up analyses will determine whether improved immune responses correlate with
clinical parameters.101
A phase 2 study investigating the use of sipuleucel-T with concurrent or sequential
abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (NCT01487863)58 recently reported interim results,
which suggest that sipuleucel-T can be successfully manufactured during concurrent
abiraterone acetate/prednisone administration.102 The potency and prime boost effect were
similar to sipuleucel-T monotherapy. However, pending the release of mature data, it is not
yet known how concurrent or sequential abiraterone acetate/prednisone administration
impacts the efficacy of sipuleucel-T.102

Combining Agents with Novel Mechanisms of Action
Preclinical and early clinical studies of immunotherapy in combination with therapeutic
modalities such as chemotherapy, RT or androgen ablation have revealed enhancement of
endogenous or induced antitumor immune responses, providing support for future clinical
evaluation of such pairings.64 There is much interest in determining whether other
modalities such as cryoablation would result in additive or synergistic effects when paired
with immunotherapy, as cryotherapy has shown promising systemic antitumor effects when

combined with other anticancer agents such as chemotherapy.103 Of note, with the
emergence of checkpoint blockade strategies, the ability to combine multiple
immunotherapy agents with divergent mechanisms of action has become an intriguing area
of scientific research. The aim is to optimize immunotherapy by targeting different aspects
of the immune response.104 Given the recent phase 1 safety and activity findings regarding
use of an antibody to block programmed death-1, an inhibitory receptor expressed by T
cells, in various tumor types,105 there is interest in combining cancer vaccines with such
immune checkpoint blockade antibodies to induce synergistic antitumor responses.104
Another approach involves the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors that can prime tumor
cells for eradication by the immune system. This is achieved through multiple mechanisms,
including the upregulation of surface molecules such as major histocompatibility complex
class I/II as well as costimulatory (CD80, CD86) and adhesion molecules.106 This
upregulation may reduce the ability of tumor cells to evade immune detection. Furthermore,
histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to downregulate Treg cells and augment
immunotherapy in animal models of renal and prostate cancers.107

Challenges in The mcrpc Treatment Landscape

Author Manuscript

Although advances in the biology of prostate cancer have vastly enhanced knowledge and
expanded the pool of agents with demonstrated efficacy, medical oncologists face key
challenges in defining the optimal treatment paradigm for this malignancy. First-line
administration of non-chemotherapy agents such as sipuleucel-T and abiraterone acetate,
rather than docetaxel, has dramatically altered the idea of the ‘typical’ patient with mCRPC.
With the variety of newly approved agents in mCRPC, administration of docetaxel is
expected to be delayed or even omitted, when possible, in favor of agents with a more
desirable risk:benefit profile.40 It is possible that in the coming years the use of docetaxel as
a therapeutic ‘landmark’ may erode away, with treatment decisions relying even more
heavily on an individual patient's prior responses to hormonal treatment and immunotherapy.
Additionally, there is a lack of head-to-head trials comparing existing standards of care and
new or emerging treatments. Direct comparison of treatments will offer greater insight into
the clinical activity of each agent. Furthermore, with the approval of abiraterone acetate,
cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in the post-chemotherapy setting, there are at least three
effective agents in this arena; therefore, choosing a comparator for future trials remains a
huge hurdle.

Author Manuscript

Given the diverse mechanisms of action for each of the agents approved for mCRPC since
2010, determining optimal sequence and combinations of agents will be essential to the
management of prostate cancer. For any two therapeutic approaches with non-overlapping
mechanisms of action, there exists the potential for cultivating synergistic improvements in
outcome, but there is also the potential for compounded toxicity profiles when the agents are
used in combination. In some cases, there is a specific preclinically or clinically supported
rationale for evaluating two agents or classes concurrently or sequentially with one another.
For example, as enzalutamide does not need to be given with corticosteroids,25 it may be a
more suitable partner for immunotherapy than docetaxel. Likewise, the low rate of
myelosuppression observed with radium-223 dichloride in the ALSYMPCA study,19 as

previously discussed, suggests that it may be a better pairing with immunotherapy than
standard RT. Additionally, in the European Union, abiraterone acetate is commonly
administered with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eprenolone rather than with
prednisone, which may be important in terms of optimal combinations with immunotherapy,
as practitioners seek to avoid the immunosuppressive effects of steroids so that patients can
achieve maximal clinical benefit.

Author Manuscript

Of note, it is not clear whether sequencing of agents will result in superior survival of
patients with mCRPC. Recent data in docetaxel-pretreated patients with mCRPC suggest
that therapy with either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate post-cabazitaxel results in
prolonged OS compared with those who received enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate precabazitaxel treatment (65 months vs 39 months (from first dose of docetaxel), respectively);
prospective trials are required to confirm these results.108 In certain cases, administration of
agents simultaneously rather than sequentially may be more efficacious. Given that
preliminary results from a trial in which enzalutamide was given after abiraterone acetate
and docetaxel suggested possible reduced efficacy in mCRPC patients,109 it is hypothesized
that simultaneous administration of these agents may lead to improved benefit, a
combination that is currently being evaluated clinically in mCRPC (NCT01650194).110

Author Manuscript

To this end, a long-term goal in the field is to distinguish clinical biomarkers that will aid in
the selection of patients who will benefit from specific therapies, which is critical in
tailoring individualized treatment regimens. It was previously shown that circulating tumor
cells are prognostic biomarkers, both before and after treatment, in patients treated with
taxanes,111 and evaluation of circulating tumor cells as predictive biomarkers is now
underway for newly approved agents. As immunotherapy continues to emerge as a treatment
modality in mCRPC, it is likely that immunoprofiling will have a greater role in diagnosis,
prognostic assessment and therapeutic strategy.112 Although immunotherapy in mCRPC is
effective in patients whose disease is chemotherapy-naive and in those pretreated with
chemotherapy, in the sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab trials, only a subset of patients in each of
these settings experienced therapeutic benefit.10,48 We do not yet have a biomarker to
determine which of these patients will exhibit the greatest benefit. Earlier use of secondary
androgen ablation in the pre-chemotherapy space begs the question of whether patients who
have received abiraterone acetate prior to chemotherapy would benefit from re-treatment
with abiraterone acetate following failure of docetaxel. Again, data are sparse and
biomarkers for androgen sensitivity are lacking, although it is possible that testosterone
levels may indicate receptiveness to androgen ablation following docetaxel.

Conclusions
Worldwide, one of the most significant challenges posed in prostate cancer management has
been establishing treatment for a patient who no longer responds to primary androgen
ablation therapy and has further progressed on docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Our improved
understanding of the complex biology that underscores the malignancy of prostate cancer
has led to clinical investigation of innovative approaches such as hormonal therapy,
radiopharmaceuticals, immunotherapy and newer chemotherapy, which offer clinicians more
options to manage metastatic disease. Ipilimumab is currently being evaluated for efficacy in

the post-docetaxel setting in a phase 3 trial. If approved, ipilimumab is expected to further
transform the treatment landscape for mCRPC.
The expanding arsenal of treatments for mCRPC has shifted the paradigm for late-line
prostate cancer therapy, which has substantial implications for the trial design of future
therapies seeking approval in this setting. There has also been a shift in the profile of the
typical mCRPC patient, as a result of increased choices for first-line therapy. The potential
of combinatorial regimens in mCRPC, including the pairing of novel immunotherapeutic
approaches with chemotherapy, RT or androgen ablation, will continue this cycle of
evolution, which will help to alleviate the current clinical challenge of navigating the most
appropriate use of the newer available agents.

Immune potentiating mechanisms of action of chemotherapies, RT and androgen
deprivation. This figure shows how anticancer drugs can activate the immune system.
Agents can inhibit immunosuppressive mechanisms of tumor-induced immune tolerance,
boost T- and/or B-cell responses or stress tumor cells so they become immunogenic and
sensitive to lysis. It is important to note that the anticancer therapies shown apply generally
to the field, and some of the agents shown are not indicated for the treatment of mCRPC.

Patient population (N)

Ipilimumab + androgen
ablation vs Androgen
ablation

Prostvac-VF vs Nilutamide,
with potential to crossover
after PSA rise to receive
combined therapies

Vaccinia-PSA (Prostvac),
after radical prostatectomy

Ipilimumab + RT vs
Ipilimumab

Combination
immunotherapy + RT vs RT

Ipilimumab + docetaxel vs
Ipilimumab

Poxvirus-PSA vaccine +
docetaxel/dexamethasone
vs Poxvirus-PSA vaccine

Treatment arm(s)

Percentage without
progression at 18 mo

Time to progression

Toxicity; serum PSA rise
related to serum testosterone
restoration, and immunologic
effects

Safety

Determine whether a PSAspecific T-cell response to the
vaccine regimen could be
mounted in the presence of
RT

Safety and activity between
arms

Determine whether docetaxel/
dexamethasone has an effect
on generating an immune
response to the vaccine

Primary end point

55 vs 38% undetectable PSA by 3 mo in the
combination arm vs androgen ablation alone arm,
respectively

Median survival exhibited a trend toward
improvement for pts initially randomized to the
vaccine arm (median 5.1 vs 3.4 y; P = 0.13); subset of
12 pts who initially received vaccine and then later
received nilutamide suggested improved survival
compared with the 8 pts who began with nilutamide
and then were treated with vaccine (median 6.2 y vs
3.7 y, P = 0.045)

No DLTs, and toxicity was minimal; noteworthy
variability in time required for testosterone
restoration, 1 pt showed continued undetectable serum
PSA (<0.2 ng/ml) for >8 mo after testosterone
restoration

No DLTs; treatment-related AEs and immune-related
AEs were common in pts treated with or without RT

13/17 pts who received combination immunotherapy
+ RT had >3-fold increase in the number of PSAspecific T cells relative to pts in the RT-alone arm,
who failed to show a detectable increase in the
number of PSA-specific T cells

Two pts who received ipilimumab monotherapy vs 1pt
who received ipilimumab + docetaxel had confirmed
PSA responses; 18 pts experienced 52 serious AEs, 10
of which were attributed to ipilimumab

3.2 mo vs 1.8 mo median time to progression in the
combination arm vs vaccine alone arm, respectively
