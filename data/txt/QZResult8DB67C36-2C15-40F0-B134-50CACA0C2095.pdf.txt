Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression correlates with microvessel density, stage, malignant ascites,
metastasis, and survival in ovarian cancer. By transducing
VEGF165 into a nontumorigenic rat ovarian surface epithelial
cell line (ROSE199), we investigated the direct effect of an
angiogenic phenotype on tumor development. The neu
oncogene, which is overexpressed in >30% of ovarian cancers,
was used in comparison. Neu-transfected ROSE199 cells
showed phenotypic characteristics of transformation in vitro
with an abundance of focus-forming units in monolayer
cultures and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. In
contrast, VEGF-secreting ROSE199 cells (VR) retained normal
morphology and in vitro growth characteristics (e.g., proliferation rate) compared with parental ROSE199 cells. Interestingly, injection of VR cells into athymic mice formed
malignant ascites in 100% of the animals when injected into
the peritoneum and developed vascularized tumors in 85% of
the mice when injected s.c. Furthermore, blocking VEGFmediated signaling by the Flk-1/KDR receptor kinase inhibitor
SU5416 significantly inhibited the growth of VR tumors. To
validate that the proangiogenic switch is responsible for
tumor development, the angiogenic phenotype was balanced
by the inducible coexpression of endostatin under the control
of Tet-activated promoter. Coexpression of endostatin along
with VEGF reversed the tumorigenic phenotype of VR cells.
These studies show that alterations in the angiogenic
characteristics of ovarian surface epithelium may play an
important role in the etiology of ovarian cancer, and that
inhibition of angiogenesis can be effective in the treatment of
epithelial ovarian cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3683–90]

Introduction
The most common form of ovarian cancer develops from the
malignant transformation of the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), a
single layer of cells that surround the ovaries. Ovarian epithelial cells
secrete lysosomal proteases that aid in follicular rupture during
ovulation. After ovulation, epithelial cells proliferate and migrate to
heal the resultant wound. The etiology of ovarian surface epithelial
cancer, however, remains poorly understood. Epidemiologic evidence supports two main theories: the ‘‘incessant ovulation’’

hypothesis and the ‘‘gonadotropin’’ hypothesis. The ‘‘incessant ovulation’’ hypothesis suggests that the risk of ovarian cancer increases
with increased the number of ovulations (1). This is supported by
evidence that a decrease in occurrence of ovarian epithelial cancer
(OEC) is found in women with reduced ovulatory cycles due to
pregnancy, lactational amenorrhea, and oral contraceptive use. It is
therefore suggested that repeated wounding and healing of the OSE
increases the susceptibility for malignant transformation. Growth
factors and cytokines influence post-ovulatory repair of the OSE and
altered regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling may also be
involved in the development of ovarian cancer (2). The ‘‘gonadotropin’’ hypothesis predicts that high levels of pituitary gonadotropins
increase cancer risk by stimulation of the OSE (3). Studies have
shown that gonadotropins stimulate OSE proliferation and induce
expression of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (4),
keratinocyte growth factor (5), and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF; ref. 6), which may play a role in the onset of OEC.
It is likely that the etiology of ovarian cancer is multifactorial, with
genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors playing a role.
Although ovarian cysts have been suggested to be involved in
ovarian cancer development, no potential precursor lesions have
been identified. Normal OSE can be transformed by introducing
SV40 large T antigen alone or with the catalytic subunit of
telomerase (hTERT), resulting in immortalized cell lines (7), but
have required additional factors such as c-erbB2 or mutant Ha-ras
transduction to induce tumorigenicity (8). Conditional expression
of SV40 large T antigen under the control of MISIIR promoter lead
to ovarian cancer in transgenic mice (9). Other recent studies have
characterized genetic models of familial ovarian cancer involving
BRCA1 mutations. These studies have suggested that Myc
activation is necessary and sufficient to transform BRCA1- and
p53-deficient OSE (10, 11). We questioned what phenotypic
alterations are necessary for immortalized nontumorigenic ovarian
surface epithelial cells to become tumorigenic. It is hypothesized
that acquiring an angiogenic phenotype is a crucial and necessary
step in the establishment of ovarian cancer.
Neovascularization is an important step in tumor growth and
metastasis (12, 13). To grow beyond a critical size, solid tumors
must acquire an angiogenic phenotype to attract nourishing
vasculature (14). Along with tumor cells, fibroblasts, macrophage,
and endothelial cells secrete a number of factors that influence the
angiogenic environment of a tumor. Acquisition of an angiogenic
phenotype is ultimately regulated by the net balance between
positive and negative regulators in the local environment (15, 16).
Studies have shown that VEGF, a potent angiogenic growth factor,
is up-regulated in ovarian tumors, and that high levels of VEGF are
found in associated ascites fluid in ovarian cancer patients (17, 18).
Furthermore, neutralization of VEGF with a monoclonal antibody
inhibits ovarian tumor growth and ascites formation in athymic

mouse models (19). We therefore determined whether the
acquisition of an angiogenic phenotype by OSE could provide
survival advantage in vivo and confer tumorigenic phenotype.
Using a nontumorigenic cell line derived from normal rat ovarian
surface epithelial cells (ROSE199), we induced high-level expression of VEGF165 and characterized its effects on OSE both in vitro
and in vivo. Constitutive expression of VEGF in ROSE199 cells led
to tumor development and malignant ascites formation. Balancing
the angiogenic phenotype with inducible expression of endostatin
reversed the tumorigenic phenotype without affecting the in vitro
growth characteristics.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. SU5416, 3-[(2,4-dimethylpyrrol-5-yl)methylidenyl]-indolin2-one, was a gift from Sugen (San Francisco, CA; ref. 20). Zeocin-selective
reagent was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA; R250-05); doxycycline hydrochloride (D-9891) and tissue culture grade DMSO were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO; D-2650).
Cell culture. The parental ROSE199 cells were derived from a line of
spontaneously immortalized rat OSE and cultured as previously described
(21). Selection and maintenance of Neu/ROSE199 cells was accomplished by
growing cells in the presence of 0.8 mg/mL G418 (Calbiochem, San Diego,
CA). VR and control vector clones were selected and maintained in DMEM
in the presence of 50 Ag/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen). G418 (0.8 mg/mL;
Calbiochem) was used for selection and maintenance of VRTet cells, and
200 g/mL Hygromycin B (Sigma) was added for selection and maintenance
of VRTet-endo cells.
Generation of transfected cell lines. Human VEGF cDNA was cloned
into the cytomegalovirus promoter–driven mammalian expression vector
pSecTag C (Invitrogen). The full-length VEGF165 cDNA (498 bp) was
inserted directly between the EcoRI and NotI sites downstream of the
murine IgGn chain signal peptide (VR). ROSE199 cells were transfected with
empty vector or VEGF expression construct by calcium phosphate method
(22). Zeocin-resistant colonies were selected with optimized concentrations
of Zeocin (50 Ag/mL), and culture supernatants were assayed for VEGF165
by ELISA. The oncogenic Neu/ROSE199 cell line was generated using
retrovirus transduction encoding the sequence for rat transforming neu
inserted into retroviral vector pINA, kindly provided by Dr. A.W. Edwards
(University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The retroviral
plasmid is a derivative of pgagneoSRV in which the rat h-actin promoter
replaced the SV40 promoter (23).
Generation of tetracycline-regulated expression of endostatin in VR
cells. A 104-bp secretory signal sequence of the VEGF165 gene was cloned
upstream to the 553-bp human endostatin cDNA. An upstream primer was
synthesized incorporating the entire secretory signal of VEGF165 gene and
BamHI restriction enzyme site (5¶-GGGGGATCCATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTTGGGTGCATTGGAGCCTCGCCTTGCTGCTCTACCTCCACCATGCC AA GTG GT C C C A G G C TG C AC C C C A C A G C C A C CG C G A C TT C - 3 ¶) .
A downstream primer was synthesized to introduce a HindIII site (5¶-GGGAAGCTTCTACTTGGAGGCAGTCAT-3¶). This cDNA contained nucleotide
sequences encoding 1504 to 2055 of human collagen XVIII for cloning into
the BamHI/HindIII site of pRev-TRE retroviral response vector (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA). We used the RevTet System to produce infective retroviral
particles providing inducible expression of human endostatin.
Measurement of VEGF165 and endostatin protein expression.
Secretion of VEGF165 protein from VR or vector only transfected ROSE199
cells in vitro was determined using a VEGF ELISA kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Tetracycline-regulated protein expression was verified using human endostatinspecific ELISA (R&D Systems), similarly as described above, except for the
presence or absence of doxycycline (1 Ag/mL).
Proliferation rate of ROSE199 cell lines. Cell proliferation in vitro was
determined by bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation assay, according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA;
ref. 24).

Characterization of transfected ROSE199 cells in vitro . The
propensity for focus formation was assessed in vitro. As a positive control,
ROSE199 cells expressing the mutant rat neu oncogene were used. Briefly,
3.0  105 neu-transfected ROSE199, VR, or control cells were seeded into
10-cm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow to 100% confluence. The
cells were incubated at 37jC + 5% CO2 for an additional 2 to 4 days before
assessing focus (colony) formation. Cultures were stained with crystal violet,
and the focal units z0.1 mm were counted. The potential for cells to form
colonies in semisolid medium was measured by suspending 4  104 VR,
control, or Neu/ROSE199 cells in 1 mL of top agar consisting of 0.36%
Bacto-agar in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The top agar was
plated onto 1.5 mL of solidified bottom agar, consisting of 0.5% Bacto-agar
in DMEM. After 21 days, the dishes were examined, and colonies containing
more than 50 cells were counted. Cloning efficiencies were determined by
the following ratio: number of colonies counted/number of cells seeded.
In vivo Matrigel assays. Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays and
morphometric analysis of vessel density were carried out as previously
described (25). When VRTet-endo or VRTet cells were used, mice were given
water containing 2 mg/mL doxycycline plus 5% sucrose ad libitum.
Tumorigenicity assays. All animals used in this study were treated
humanely, and the experiments were carried out by strictly following the
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Female athymic mice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were obtained from National Cancer
Institute. Control or VR cells (2  106) were suspended in 200 AL of sterile
saline and injected either i.p. or s.c. into the right hind flank of the animal.
For SU5416 studies, animals were treated once daily with a 50-AL i.p. bolus
injection of SU5416 (15 mg/kg/d), a selective Flk-1/KDR receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, in DMSO or vehicle alone for 14 days beginning 3 days after
implantation. Treatment was initiated on the same day as cell transplantation in ‘‘preventive’’ studies or on day 7 for ‘‘therapeutic’’ studies.
To test the effect of endostatin on VR cell tumor development, 2  106
VRTet-endo or VRTet cells were resuspended in 200 AL of sterile PBS and
injected s.c. into the right hind flank of the animals. After 7 days, half the
mice injected with VRTet-endo cells (n = 10) and animals injected with
VRTet cells (n = 10) received drinking water supplemented with doxycycline
(2 mg/mL) and sucrose (5%) ad libitum. The other half of the VRTet-endo–
injected mice (n = 10) received plain water to rule out possible effects of
doxycycline supplementation. For all s.c. models, tumor growth was
measured by vernier calipers. Tumor volume was calculated by the
following formula: tumor volume (mm3) = (pab 2) / 6, where a represents
the length (longest diameter in mm), and b represents the tumor width
(shorter diameter in mm). For i.p. models, mice were monitored for ascites
formation and signs of disease by palpation. Animals were kept until natural
death, or until they became moribund and necessitated culling. Animals
were autopsied for the presence of solid tumor and ascites. Statistical
significance was determined by Student’s t test. To ascertain that the
tumors were derived from the injected cells, parts of the tumor tissues were
minced, treated with collagenase, and cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS and
50 Ag/mL Zeocin (VR cells) and 0.8 mg/mL G418 (VRTet-endo) to verify
maintenance of antibiotic resistance. Diagnostic toxicity was assessed by
average body weight and hematocrit levels (% RBC).
Telomerase levels. Normal rat ovarian surface epithelial cells were
isolated following published methods (21). Cytokeratin staining and cobble
stone morphology confirmed epithelial cell characteristics (data not
shown). Primary cells were grown to reach subconfluence and then
harvested. Telomerase levels were determined by TeloTAGGG telomerase
PCR ELISA assay method (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Telomerase levels were expressed as
relative levels compared with positive control provided in the kit.

Results
Expression of VEGF165 in ROSE199 cells. We have previously
found that human VEGF165 stimulates proliferation and migration
of multiple endothelial cell lines, including human umbilical
vascular endothelial cell, bovine capillary endothelium, and mouse
microvascular heart endothelial cells (SMHEC4). Therefore,

kROSE199 and ROSE cells show similar characteristics regarding to laminin, cytokeratin-7, cytokeratin-8, cytokeratin-19, and 7-hydroxysteroid
expression; both are nontumorigenic and substrate dependent and show contact inhibition.

ROSE199 cells were transfected with pSecTag C containing the
entire coding sequence for VEGF165 (VR) or pSecTag C vector only
(control). Zeocin-resistant clones transfected with VEGF165
secreted VEGF protein ranging from 300 to 3,200 pg/mL as
measured by ELISA. No significant detection was observed in
control transfected ROSE199. Clones expressing higher levels of
VEGF (>2,000 pg/mL) were selected for further studies. Expression
of neu in pneuINA-transfected ROSE199 cells was verified by
immunohistochemical staining of G418-resistant cells using a ratspecific anti-neu antibody (Oncogene Research Products; data not
shown).
Proliferation rate of ROSE199 cells in vitro. The ability of
VEGF165 to influence the growth of ROSE199 cells in vitro was
investigated. Viable cell counts were done on parental ROSE199,
VR, and control cells at 24, 48, and 72 h time points. Viable cell

counts by trypan blue exclusion revealed no significant difference
in cell proliferation rate between the different ROSE199 cell lines
in vitro. These data were further confirmed by determining viable
cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. There was no significant difference in cell doubling
time between the cell lines. Parental ROSE199 cells had a doubling
time of 16 h (doubling time: control, 17.4 h; VR cells, 18.2 h). The
marginal differences seen in doubling times were not statistically
significant (Table 1).
Similarly, coexpression of endostatin under the inducible
promoter Tet did not alter the growth rate of VR ovarian surface
epithelial cells in vitro (data not shown). Furthermore, we
compared the telomerase activity in the transduced cells with
primary normal rat ovarian surface epithelial cells. These studies
showed that the relative levels of telomerase activity of VR and

VRTet-endo had relatively lesser telomerase activity when compared with the normal primary OSE cells (Table 1). Between
ROSE199 and VR, there was 1.5-fold more telomerase activity.
Between VR and VRTet-endo, there was no significant difference in
telomerase activity.
In vitro phenotypes of transfected ROSE199 cells. Anchorage
independence (growth in soft agar) and focus formation are
generally considered phenotypic markers of transformation.
Parental ROSE199 cells have previously been shown to retain
characteristics of normal epithelium (21). We assayed transfected
ROSE199 cells for focus formation in monolayer cultures and
anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Results summarized in
Table 1 show that the oncogenic neu-transfected ROSE199 cells
formed foci in vitro, but neither control, VR, nor pINA/ROSE199
cells were able to form foci after reaching confluence. Similar
results were observed in anchorage-independent growth assays
where the Neu/ROSE199 cells were able to form multiple large
colonies in soft agar with a cloning efficiency of f70%, whereas
parental ROSE199 and control cells produced no colonies at any of
the cell densities tested. VR cells, however, did form a small
number of colonies in soft agar, with an average cloning efficiency
of 5%.
Angiogenesis induced by ROSE199 transfectants. To assess
angiogenic stimulation by the different ROSE199 cell lines in vivo, a
Matrigel plug assay was done. Seven days after implantation,
animals were euthanized and Matrigel specimens resected for
histologic examination (Fig. 1A). H&E staining revealed microvessels dispersed throughout Matrigel containing VR and Neu/
ROSE199 cells compared with nearly avascular Matrigel containing
either the control or pINA/ROSE199 cells (Fig. 1A). In addition,
Matrigel plugs were stained with an anti-CD31 phycoerythrin

conjugate, and vessels were directly visualized by fluorescence
microscopy (Fig. 1A). A traditional estimation of microvessel
density was done by a manual count of tumor blood vessels per
high power field (200 magnification) as well as evaluation using
computer-assisted image analysis, as first described by Wild et al.
(25). VEGF- and Neu-transfected ROSE199 implanted Matrigel
plugs had a 4- to 5-fold higher vessel count than Matrigel plugs
containing control ROSE199 cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 1B).
Tumorigenicity of VEGF-transfected ROSE199 cells. In
parallel experiments, mice were injected either s.c. or i.p. with
control or VR cells. Tumor incidence was 20 out of 20 (100%) in
mice injected i.p. with VR cells and 17 out of 20 (85%) in mice
injected s.c. with VR within 2 months after cell transplantation. In
contrast, no tumors (0 of 20) developed in any of the mice injected
with control cells in either s.c. or i.p. models. However, one i.p.
injected control mouse died early on without any apparent sign of
disease. Animals injected s.c. with VR cells developed palpable,
vascularized tumors that reached an average size of 2,500 mm3 in
volume (Fig. 2A and B). Tumors were locally invasive into muscle
and adipose tissue, but no distant metastases were found. The
animals injected i.p. with VR cells necessitated culling within
2 months after injection due to extensive ascites formation and
animals becoming moribund (Fig. 2C and D). Examination of the
peritoneum revealed widespread intra-abdominal tumor mass and
up to 11 mL of ascites fluid per mouse.
Inhibition of VR tumor growth by SU5416. SU5416 is a
selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase and has
previously been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor
types (20). We tested the ability of SU5416 to inhibit VR tumor
growth in s.c. and i.p. models. In s.c. models, mice were treated
i.p. with SU5416 (15 mg/kg/d) or vehicle alone starting on the day

of cell transplantation (preventive), or 7 days after cell
transplantation (therapeutic). SU5416 significantly inhibited VR
tumor growth in both ‘‘preventive’’ and ‘‘therapeutic’’ treatment
regimens by 9 weeks after cell transplantation (Fig. 3A and B).
The average tumor volume for treated versus control in the
‘‘preventive’’ and ‘‘therapeutic’’ models were 56 versus 500 mm3
and 700 versus 2,300 mm3, respectively. The control, vehicletreated group from the therapeutic model had different growth
rate when compared with the prevention model (Fig. 3A). This
can be in part attributable to the effect of vehicle on different sets
of tumor microenvironment (stromal cells) between the prevention and therapeutic models. In mice receiving treatment
immediately, tumor development was delayed by 4 weeks
compared with controls. We next tested efficacy of SU5416 in
an i.p. model to more closely resemble the physiologic
environment of the disease. In the i.p. model, mice were treated
i.p. with SU5416 (15 mg/kg/d) or vehicle starting on day 7 after
cell transplantation. Treated animals had an increase in survival
time of >3 weeks compared with control mice with 50% of mice
in the control group dying by day 50 after cell transplantation
compared with day 75 in the treated group (data not shown).
Potential toxicities were assessed indirectly by body weight
measurements and directly by determining the hematocrit levels
in all animals at the end of treatment. There was no significant
change in mean body weight (16–18 g) or hematocrit levels
(52–55% RBC) between the treatment groups. These data show
that treatment with SU5416 significantly inhibits ovarian surface
epithelial tumor growth in both ‘‘preventive’’ and ‘‘therapeutic’’
models.
Tet-operated inducible expression of endostatin in VR cells.
Endostatin expression construct was prepared as described
before, and the reading frame and sequence was confirmed by
DNA sequencing. After transduction, VRTet-endo clones were
selected for G418 and Hygromycin B resistance, and culture
supernatant was assayed for the presence of secreted endostatin
protein in the presence or absence of doxycycline (1 mg/mL).
Expression of endostatin protein was confirmed by ELISA. One
clone in particular (clone 13) showed high-level endostatin
expression in the presence of doxycycline with up to 5,000 pg per
million cells. This clone was further analyzed for tetracycline
regulated endostatin expression in the presence of increasing
concentrations of doxycycline. ELISA results show a concentrationdependent increase in endostatin expression with >5,000 pg protein
secreted per million cells at a concentration of doxycycline of
500 ng/mL (Fig. 4A). In addition, we verified the presence of
endostatin mRNA expression by VRTet-endo clones using reverse
transcription-PCR (data not shown).
Biological activity of endostatin in vivo. To determine if the
recombinant endostatin retained antiangiogenic activity, we
measured recruitment of microvessels into Matrigel plugs containing endostatin-secreting VR cells, as described above. Animals were
treated with doxycycline for 1 week. H&E and CD31 staining
revealed a high density of microvessels dispersed throughout
Matrigel plugs containing VRTet control cells compared with
significantly fewer microvessels recruited into Matrigel plugs
containing VRTet-endo cells (Fig. 4B). Quantification of fluorescent
pixels showed a statistically significant inhibition of microvessel
recruitment in VRTet-endo containing Matrigel plugs compared
with VRTet with an average of 34,125 F 8,648 versus 13,672 F 4490
pixels as determined by morphometric computer-assisted analysis
(Fig. 4C; *, P < 0.05).

vehicle for a total of 14 d. Each group included 10 mice. A, mice receiving

mice were significantly reduced compared with control mice. *, P < 0.05 for time
points between weeks 7 and 9. B, mice receiving therapeutic treatment regimen.
Points, mean of 10 animals; bars, SE. Arrow indicates start of treatment.

Effect of endostatin expression of VR tumor growth. To
determine the effect of endostatin expression on VR tumor
development in vivo, 2  106 VRTet-endo cells were injected s.c.
into the right hind flanks of athymic mice with or without
doxycycline supplementation in their drinking water. Animals
receiving water without doxycycline, and therefore no endostatin
induction, developed large tumors reaching an average tumor
volume of 700 mm3 by 4 weeks after cell implantation (Fig. 5). In
contrast, tumor growth was completely inhibited in animals when
endostatin expression was induced by doxycycline supplementation. There was no evidence of toxicity in any of the animals tested.
These data suggest that balancing the angiogenic phenotype of VR
cells by the coexpression of endostatin can significantly inhibit
tumor formation and reverse the tumorigenic phenotype in vivo.

Discussion
VEGF expression is implicated in the pathology of ovarian cancer,
and a higher level of VEGF is associated with poor prognosis
(26, 27). However, the role of VEGF in the etiology of ovarian cancer
is not completely understood. A number of gain-of-function

fibroblasts as a model system, Weinberg et al. elegantly showed
that at least two fundamental changes had to occur for malignant
transformation. In their studies, perturbation of two signaling
pathways involving p53 and Raf is sufficient to transform
nontumorigenic murine cells to acquire a tumorigenic phenotype
(31). However, six different genetic changes, including telomerase
activation and perturbed tissue-specific intracellular signaling
pathways, were found necessary for normal human cells to become
tumorigenic (32). Our studies show that ROSE199 cells had very
similar levels of telomerase activity when compared with freshly
isolated normal OSE. Telomerase activity could have helped in
immortalization, but that was not sufficient to confer a tumorigenic phenotype to ROSE199 cells. Using this model system, we
investigated whether perturbation in angiogenic phenotype could
contribute to the establishment of ovarian cancer. ROSE199 cells
transduced by retrovirus expressing mutated rat neu altered the
growth characteristics resembling malignant phenotype and
formed tumors in athymic mice (33). Additionally, activation of
the neu oncogene has been shown to induce VEGF expression in
tumor cells (34). To determine the role of angiogenesis in OSE, we
compared in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics of parental
ROSE199 (negative control) and Neu/ROSE199 (positive control)
cells with VEGF- and vector only–transfected ROSE199 cells.
Injection of VR cells s.c. or i.p. into female nude mice resulted in
tumor formation. None of the mice injected with control cells
developed tumors. These studies show that overexpression of the
potent angiogenic stimulator VEGF confers a tumorigenic phenotype to the ROSE199 cell line. VEGF expression seems to provide
in vivo survival advantage to ROSE199 cells because in vitro growth
characteristics were not altered. Previous studies have also
suggested a more functional role for VEGF in ovarian cancer
development and progression in mice (35). Lee et al. studied the
use of VEGF for therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic myocardium
and showed that unregulated and continuous expression of VEGF
in murine myoblasts lead to formation of endothelial cell–derived
vascular tumors in immunodeficient mice (36). Furthermore,

mutations, such as the overexpression of neu/c-erbB2, and lossof-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1/2
(28) and p53 (29) are associated with ovarian cancer. Studies have
also shown that the neu/c-erbB2 gene is frequently amplified and/
or overexpressed in human epithelial ovarian cancers (30).
However, the threshold of genetic changes needed to transform
normal OSE to a tumorigenic cell is not defined. Using murine

Angiogenic Modulation and Ovarian Cancer

Arbriser et al. showed that overexpression of VEGF121 in MS1
endothelial cells resulted in development of slowly growing
endothelial tumors in nude mice (37). Moreover, this report
underscores the importance of VEGF involvement in ascites
development. VEGF is known to induce permeability of microvessels (38), and ascites formation is thought to be caused by an
increased influx of fluid and blockage of lymphatics. In our study,
i.p. injected VR, but not control cells, developed extensive
abdominal ascites, providing distinct evidence for the role of
VEGF in ascites formation in ovarian cancer.
Tumorigenic cells are known to have altered growth characteristics such as the loss of contact inhibition, focus formation,
anchorage-independent growth in semisolid media, and invasion
through extracellular matrix. Characterization of the VR cells
revealed that in contrast to the Neu/ROSE199 cells, VEGF
expression did not alter ROSE199 cell growth in vitro. In addition
to cell proliferation, focus-forming assays were used to determine
potential phenotypic changes in VR cells. These studies showed
that Neu/ROSE199 cells formed multiple foci indicating oncogenemediated transformed cell phenotype. VR cells however did not
form foci to any significant levels. In addition, Neu/ROSE199 cells
formed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar colony-forming
assays. These studies again showed that VEGF expression in
ROSE199 cells retained the phenotype of the parental ROSE199
cells (39) and did not lead to the acquisition of transformed
phenotype often seen in oncogene-transduced cells. It is also true
that bona fide cancer cells do not necessarily express some of the
neoplastic properties in culture, or even grow in suspension,
although they are malignant and invasive in vivo. For example,
OVCAR3 cells do not invade Boyden chambers and are, to a high
degree, anchorage dependent; yet, implanted in severe combined
immunodeficient mice, they are highly malignant (40). Human
cervical cancer cell line C-4II displays contact inhibition and only
forms monolayers in culture but develops invasive tumors in
experimental animals (41). Most likely, the in vivo microenvironment contributes additional factors, such as hormones and stromal
components, which benefits or even potentially promotes a
neoplastic phenotype. Moreover, under certain conditions,
ROSE199 cells themselves are able to deposit such stromal matrix
and basal membrane components to confer a more invasive
tumorigenic phenotype (39).
Another change often seen in tumorigenic cells is increased
telomerase activity associated with immortalization. Unlike the
human normal cells, murine cells are known to have higher levels
of constitutive telomerase activity. A comparison of telomerase
activity between freshly isolated rat OSE and VR cells showed
similar levels of telomerase, indicating that VEGF transduction
did not lead to overexpression of telomerase. Therefore, VEGF
seems to confer an in vivo growth advantage for ROSE199 cells
by sustained angiogenesis leading to tumorigenicity. Angiogenesis
of course is necessary for even benign tumor cells and normal
ovarian cells such as the granulosa cells of the corpus luteum
(reviewed in ref. 42). Luteal angiogenesis (immediately following
ovulation, early luteal phase) and vessel regression (late luteal
phase, before the onset of next ovulatory cycle) are hormonally
orchestrated by the modulation of complex sets of growth factors
(VEGF and angiopoietin 2) and leukotriens. Therefore, the normal
ovarian angiogenesis is highly regulated and balanced. In
contrast, immortal ovarian epithelial cells acquiring sustained
secretion of an angiogenic growth factor leads to tumorigenesis.
This notion is further confirmed by the reversal of the

www.aacrjournals.org

tumorigenic phenotype by the coexpression of endostatin, an
angiogenesis inhibitor.
It is possible that epithelial cells are capable of an autocrinesignaling pathway via VEGF and its receptors Flk-1/KDR or Flt-1.
Abu-Jawdeh et al. showed expression of VEGF mRNA and protein
in malignant and borderline tumors of the ovary but low to no
expression in normal ovarian cortex or surface epithelium (17).
This was further confirmed by Boocock et al. who showed
expression of mRNAs encoding VEGF, Flt-1, and Flk-1/KDR in
primary ascitic cells and in multiple ovarian carcinoma cell lines
(43). To ascertain if autocrine stimulation was possible, we
analyzed the different ROSE199 cell lines for VEGF receptor mRNA
expression by real-time PCR and found low-level expression of both
Flk-1 and Flt-1 receptor transcripts (data not shown). However,
when we analyzed the proliferation rate of the VEGF-transfected
cells compared with parental ROSE199 and control vector-transfected cells, with and without exogenous VEGF administration, we
observed no change in growth rate compared with parental
ROSE199 cells. Therefore, VEGF does not seem to act as an
autocrine growth factor for ROSE199 cells in vitro. VEGF has been
shown to be an important survival factor for endothelial cells
under chemical or physical stress as well as reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in hypertrophied myocardium (44). Moreover,
recent studies show that stress-induced changes in VEGF
secretion in ovarian cancer cells are mediated by h-adrenergic
receptors (45). Use of h-blockers has reduced VEGF production
and tumor growth in athymic mice. In other studies, inhibition of
VEGF-mediated angiogenic response (13, 46) and interference
with VEGF-mediated signaling could inhibit tumor growth. Ke-lin
et al. showed significant reduction in solid tumor growth and
ascites fluid development in mice treated with antibodies to
VEGF (47). A later study by Lin et al. showed a 75% inhibition of
tumor growth and 50% reduction in vascular density in
carcinoma transplant models using a recombinant soluble VEGF
receptor (48). In our studies, SU5416, a potent and selective
inhibitor of Flk-1/KDR receptor tyrosine kinase, was found to
inhibit VR cell–induced tumors in mice. These studies suggest
that VEGF secreted by the ROSE199 cells is necessary for the
tumor growth. Similarly, SU6668, a kinase inhibitor with broader
specificity, was effective in limiting ovarian tumor growth (20, 49).
Because SU5416 targets host endothelial cells, this treatment may
be effective in escaping development of drug resistance common
to many chemotherapeutic agents.
These studies show that triggering the angiogenic ‘‘switch’’ by
overexpressing a potent angiogenic growth factor is an important
step in development of ovarian surface epithelial cancer. The
angiogenic phenotype of a cell or tissue is controlled by a balance
between of positive and negative regulators (15, 16). Several studies
have shown that altering the balance of these factors can
significantly influence tumor development and growth (50, 51).
Here, we also investigated whether expressing an endogenous
antiangiogenic molecule (endostatin) was sufficient to reverse the
angiogenic phenotype and consequently tumorigenicity of VR cells
in athymic mice. Using a tetracycline-inducible retroviral expression system, we were able to dose-dependently induce of
endostatin protein expression in VR cells upon treatment with
doxycycline. We used clones expressing high levels of endostatin,
up to 7,000 pg per million cells, and found that the recombinant
endostatin was able to suppress angiogenesis in vivo as seen in
Matrigel assays where microvessel recruitment into Matrigel plugs
was significantly reduced.

Injection of VRTet-endo into nude mice with or without
doxycycline supplementation showed that coexpression of endostatin along with VEGF resulted in the reversal of angiogenic
phenotype and thereby inhibiting the tumorigenic capacity of VR
cells. Control mice injected with VRTet-endo cells without
doxycycline supplementation formed palpable, vascularized
tumors with cumulative tumor volumes similar to those observed
in the parental VR cell line. Therefore, shifting the balance of
angiogenic factors in this cell line was sufficient to inhibit
vascularization of Matrigel plugs and tumor formation in mice.
The results described in this study show the importance of an
angiogenic phenotype in the formation of ovarian cancer and
