ABSTRACT
Cancer drugs often fail due to the emergence of clinical resistance. This can
manifest through mutations in target proteins that selectively exclude drug binding
whilst retaining aberrant function. A priori knowledge of resistance-inducing mutations
is therefore important for both drug design and clinical surveillance. Stapled peptides
represent a novel class of antagonists capable of inhibiting therapeutically relevant
protein-protein interactions. Here, we address the important question of potential
resistance to stapled peptide inhibitors. HDM2 is the critical negative regulator of p53,
and is often overexpressed in cancers that retain wild-type p53 function. Interrogation
of a large collection of randomly mutated HDM2 proteins failed to identify point
mutations that could selectively abrogate binding by a stapled peptide inhibitor (PM2).
In contrast, the same interrogation methodology has previously uncovered point
mutations that selectively inhibit binding by Nutlin, the prototypical small molecule
inhibitor of HDM2. Our results demonstrate both the high level of structural p53
mimicry employed by PM2 to engage HDM2, and the potential resilience of stapled
peptide antagonists to mutations in target proteins. This inherent feature could reduce
clinical resistance should this class of drugs enter the clinic.

The stapled peptide PM2/sMTide-02 binds to
the highly evolutionary conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase
HDM2 [3, 8, 9]. PM2 inhibits HDM2 from targeting p53
for proteosomal degradation via ubiquitination [10–13].
Cell fate in response to a plethora of stress signals is
directed by p53 [14, 15]. The pro-apoptotic activity of
p53 is compromised in 50% of all cancers via mutation,
highlighting its importance [16, 17]. In certain cancers
where p53 is not mutated, its function is often mitigated
through overexpression of HDM2 [18, 19]. Inhibition of
HDM2 by a wide range of antagonists has been shown
to lead to increased cellular levels of wild type p53 and
cell death [20–23]. In normal cells, HDM2 inhibition can
cause reversible arrest, highlighting a possible target for
cyclotherapy regimens [24–26]. The prototypical HDM2
antagonist Nutlin and its numerous derivatives comprise a
signature chemotope that recapitulates the interaction of 3

INTRODUCTION
Stapled peptides are emerging as a robust class
of synthetic biologics capable of selectively perturbing
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) [1, 2]. The judicious
introduction of a chemical tether (the “staple”) linking
two amino acid side chains of a peptide can result in prestabilization of the alpha helical conformation favoured
in complex formation with a target protein. Importantly,
stapling can also impart the desirable drug-like properties
of cell penetration, protease resistance and intracellular
target engagement on otherwise biologically inert
peptides [3, 4]. Stapled peptides targeting numerous
intracellular targets have been described, with many
employing an all-hydrocarbon olefin stapling moiety
[5]. Alternative stapling chemistries have also been
reported [6, 7].

key residues in the N-terminal region of p53 (F19, W23,
L26) with a hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain
of HDM2 [20, 27–29]. These 3 residues are absolutely
required in effective peptidic antagonists including PM2
[30–32].
In vitro selection has identified point mutations
in HDM2 that selectively abrogate Nutlin binding, with
no loss in interaction with p53 [33]. As small molecule
HDM2 inhibitors have only recently entered clinical trials
[34–40], it remains to be seen whether this mechanism of
drug resistance will be realized in patients with cancers
that retain wild-type p53. Ex vivo studies have indicated
inactivating p53 mutations and endoreduplication as
principal modes of resistance to Nutlin efficacy [38,
41–43]. However, a recent in vivo study using xenograft
tumours in mice showed development of resistance to
the Nutlin analogue SAR405838 was associated with
a point-mutated p53 that still retained activity [23, 44].
Notably, PM2 and several derivatives are able to bind and
antagonize Nutlin-resistant HDM2 [45]. This is attributed
to the broad, diffuse network of contacts they form with
HDM2, which contrasts with the intrinsically limited
number of “anchor” points employed by the comparatively
small molecule Nutlin [20, 46, 47].

The engagement mode of peptidic antagonists
suggests that resistance through point mutation in target
proteins is less likely compared to small molecule binders.
However, this has yet to be experimentally verified. Here,
using the PM2-HDM2 interaction as a model system, we
carried out in vitro selections to identify point mutations
in the N-terminal domain of HDM2 that would selectively
preclude binding of PM2 but not p53. The results show
that a significant phenotype is only commensurate with
co-loss of p53 binding, and therefore unlikely to occur
in cancers that retain p53 function. Peptidic drugs
may therefore prove robust antagonists in oncology
applications, where clinical resistance is of fundamental
importance to the treatment outcome [48, 49].

RESULTS
HDM2 variants resistant to PM2 inhibition show
reduced p53 binding
To evolve PM2-resistant HDM2 we used a
previously described method that enabled selection
of Nutlin-resistant HDM2 variants (Figure 1) [33, 50,
51]. A library of randomly mutated genes expressing

the HDM2 N-terminal domain (with a C-terminal HA
tag) and containing a p53 response element (RE) was
clonally segregated into the aqueous compartments of a
water in oil emulsion along with the p53-expressing gene
cassette and PM2. Within each compartment, protein
expression occurs, and in the absence of inhibitor, a
complex forms between p53, variant HDM2 and the
gene encoding the variant HDM2. In the presence of
PM2, this complex does not form unless the HDM2 is
mutated to exclude PM2, but not p53 binding. Upon
disruption of the emulsion, persisting complexes are
enriched by immunoprecipitation using magnetic beads
coated with anti-HA antibody, and the genes encoding
resistant HDM2 variants amplified by PCR for further
rounds of selection and/or secondary assays. After 4
rounds of selection, 3 HDM2 variants (C8, C11 and C12)
were identified that showed PM2 resistance as judged by
pull-down assay using in vitro expressed proteins (Figure
2A). Whilst these appeared significantly resistant to PM2,
with little or no reduction in their interaction with p53 in
the presence of PM2 (top and second panel), this came
at the cost of reduced p53 binding compared to wild
type N-terminal domain, particularly for C11 and C12.
All selectants showed a high mutational burden, with
9-12 mutations present in each (Figure 3). Six specific
mutations were present in more than one selectant
(boxed), highly indicative of positive selection. The initial
library was made to include the M62A mutation shown to
abrogate Nutlin binding. Whilst this mutation in isolation
does not affect PM2 binding, it was introduced to bias
selections as it removes a sizeable packing interface
between PM2 and HDM2 [47] . However, reversion
of this mutation in the C8 selectant did not alter the
phenotype (Figure 2B), indicating the importance of the

other mutations. The C8 selectant showed the strongest
resistance phenotype, and therefore all 9 constituent
mutations were next analysed as N-terminal single point
mutants to assay their relative contributions (Figure 4
and Figure S1A). The mutations generally fell into two
groups: a subset that was clearly resistant to PM2 binding
albeit at the cost of reduced p53 binding (L34P, Y60C)
and a group that retained p53 binding and showed weak
resistance to PM2 (F55L, P89S, I99V). Interestingly,
with the exception of I99V, all of these mutants displayed
Nutlin resistance (Figure 4, panel 2). The Y67H, C77R,
and V108A point mutants showed no PM2-resistance
phenotype. The reduced binding of the L34P mutant may
arise from the significantly reduced expression levels in
the assay compared to WT N-terminal domain (Figure
4). However, reduced p53 interaction was also observed
in subsequent experiments using the full-length HDM2
point mutant whose expression was comparable to WT,
both in vitro and ex vivo (Figure 5, 6B). The mutations
displaying the PM2-resistant phenotype behaved similarly
when introduced as point mutants into full-length HDM2
and assayed for p53 interaction (Figure 5A, 5B). In the
context of full-length protein, only the F55L mutant
showed notable Nutlin resistance (Figure 5A). The
difference in behavior towards Nutlin binding/inhibition
between the N-terminal and full-length proteins possibly
results from the secondary p53 interaction site in the
acidic domain of HDM2 [52, 53].
We additionally analysed the K36E, Y48C and L54P
point mutants derived from the C11 and C12 selectants as
these mutations were shared exclusively between them.
Only the L54P mutation showed an exceptionally weak
resistance phenotype, and this came at the cost of reduced
interaction with p53 (Figure S1B).

activity rising to ~26% for both. In the case of HDM2-C8,
initial knockdown of p53 activity was ~ 6-fold reduced,
most likely a result of the reduced interaction capability
of C8 with p53 (Figure 2). Importantly, addition of PM2
did not result in any significant increase in p53 activity,
indicating a resistance phenotype. Similarly, Nutlin had
little effect in abrogating the function of C8. Analysis
of C8-derived point mutants showed that the L34P and
Y60C mutations in isolation could partially recapitulate
the parental phenotype (Figure 6B). Both mutants showed

No significant resistance observed in BHK cells
using the fluorescent two-hybrid assay

significantly decreased knockdown of p53 activity (~7
fold compared to WT HDM2), again most likely due
the reduced interaction observed in vitro (Figures 4, 5),
with no rescue observed after addition of either PM2 or
Nutlin. The F55L and I99V point mutants displayed a
weak resistance phenotype in this assay. Both reduced
knockdown of p53 activity (~1.5-fold compared to WT
HDM2) and whilst addition of PM2 rescued activity, the
magnitude of this was consistently less for both mutants
compared to WT HDM2 (~3.2 versus ~ 4-fold)(Figures
6B, 6C). The P89S mutant essentially behaved like wildtype HDM2.

Interaction of HDM2-C8 and the L34P, F55L,
Y60C point mutants with p53 was further studied using
the fluorescent two-hybrid assay (F2H) [54]. This assay
facilitates real-time detection of p53-HDM2 interaction in
living cells and perturbation by small molecule/peptidic
antagonists. It requires expression of the p53 N-terminal
domain (residues 1-81) as a fusion with GFP and HDM2
(residues 7-134) as a fusion with RFP in transgenic F2HBHK mammalian cells. As observed for recombinant
expression in E.Coli, only the HDM2-F55L mutant
could be stably expressed in this system, and the results
indicated no significant difference compared to WT for
inhibition by both PM2 and Nutlin (Figure S2). The weak
difference observed in pull-down, reporter and FP assays
is therefore likely to be below the detection threshold of
the F2H assay or to be less profound in an intracellular
environment. Collectively, these results confirm what is
essentially a weak phenotype for the F55L mutation in
mammalian cells.

The HDM2-F55L variant shows reduced relative
binding affinity to PM2
We next used the fluorescence polarisation (FP)
assay to measure relative binding affinity of PM2 to
recombinantly expressed HDM2 (1-125) and relevant
mutants. Only the F55L mutant could be stably expressed
in E. coli and purified, and this showed a slightly reduced
relative binding affinity to PM2 compared to WT HDM2
(117 ± 30 nM and 53 ± 9 nM respectively), consistent
with the in vitro pull-down assays and cell-based reporter
assay. Using this assay, binding to the p53 peptide
(amino acids 16 to 29 ) was also slightly comprised
for F55L compared to WT HDM2 ( 7 ± 1.2 μM and 3
± 0.7 μM respectively), in this case consistent with the
slightly reduced activity of HDM2 F55L on p53 function
compared to WT (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
The comparatively larger interaction footprint of a
stapled peptide antagonist should impart broad resistance
to point mutations. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a
high-throughput selection for mutations in the N-terminal
domain of HDM2 that inhibit stapled peptide, but not p53

binding. The results indicate that whilst PM2-binding
can be abrogated by mutation in HDM2, this generally
comes at the cost of significantly reduced p53 binding,
and hence would be unlikely to occur in cancers where
p53 is not frequently inactivated. Note that the residual
p53 binding of these mutants is sufficient to withstand the
selection conditions employed. This binding may partially
result from a secondary interaction site in the C-terminal
domain of p53 that interacts with the HMD2 N-terminal
domain [55].
The crystal structure of the stapled peptide M06
bound to HDM2-M62A was recently described [47]. As
MO6 differs from PM2 by a single amino acid (Figure
7), we have used this structure to further understand the
mutations present in HDM2-C8. The mutations L34P and
Y60C result in significantly decreased interaction with

p53 and resistance to PM2 inhibition (Figures 4, 5, 6B).
The side chains of L34 and Y60 pack against numerous
hydrophobic residues contributing to the p53-binding
hydrophobic cleft (Figure 8). Mutations to less bulky
residues (P and C respectively) likely result in altered
structural dynamics/conformation of the cleft, causing
gross destabilization that inhibits both p53 and PM2
binding. Poor expression yields of proteins containing
these mutations (both in vitro and ex vivo) support this
notion. A very similar phenotype was observed for the
L82P mutation in HDM2 that makes it resistant to Nutlin
binding at the cost of reduced p53 binding [33].
The mutations F55L and I99V resulted in a weak
PM2 resistance phenotype with p53 binding only slightly
impaired (Figures 4-6). F55 resides in the α2 helix
(residues 50-65) and its sidechain projects into solution.

When bound to HDM2, the hydrophobic staple moiety of
MO6 packs against F55 (Figure 9, left panel). The same
interaction is observed in the structure of the SAH-8
stapled peptide bound to HDM2 [56]. As the hydrocarbon
staple is the major differentiating factor between p53 and
stapled peptide, mutations would be expected to arise
that discriminate against it. Mutation to leucine could
therefore result in less optimal packing of the staple
against the α2 helix. To further test this, we mutated F55
to the less bulky/hydrophobic alanine and carried out in
vitro pull down assays. Surprisingly, the results showed
this mutation to make little difference towards interaction
with p53 or PM2 (Figure S3). In the structure of M06
bound to HDM2-M62A the staple re-orientates itself to
overcome loss of a favourable packing interaction with

M62. In light of this remarkable plasticity, it is plausible
that it can re-orientate to overcome loss of the favourable
F55 interaction when mutated to alanine. Mutation to
the slightly less bulky, but still hydrophobic leucine may
not warrant conformation changes in the staple, instead
resulting in slightly reduced packing interactions and the
weak resistance phenotype observed.
Interaction of p53 with the HDM2 N-terminal
domain is mediated by three signature residues in p53
(F19, F23, L26) that interact with discrete pockets in the
HDM2 binding cleft [27]. I99 resides in the α2’ helix
(residues 95-104) that forms one side of the pocket that
accommodates L26 of p53. The side chain of I99 is in
close proximity to L26 whose interaction is favoured
through hydrophobic interactions. An overlay of the MO6

Primers

and the p53 peptides bound to HDM2 shows a relatively
extended conformation of the alpha helix in the stapled
peptide. This significantly alters the C-alpha position
of L26, resulting in an altered side chain projection that
is more proximal to I99 (Figure 9; right panel). Upon
mutation to valine, the extended strand in p53 containing
L26 can more readily adjust its packing arrangements to
accommodate this mutation and maintain complementarity
with the HDM2 protein surface. The stapled peptide is
however more rigid, and has less conformational space
open to it. If it were to re-orientate its binding pose to
form better contacts with the valine it would likely disrupt
favourable contacts elsewhere. Notably, mutation to the
smaller alanine residue (I99A) did not lead to any further
discrimination, resulting in drastic loss of p53 binding
(Figure S4), highlighting the inability of p53 (and most
likely PM2) to adjust binding pose to compensate for the
loss of a critical hydrophobic interaction.
Mutations outside of the N-terminal domain of
HDM2 have been shown to allosterically modulate its
binding properties [33, 57]. In this study we focused
on the N-terminal domain with the aim of exploring as
much mutational diversity as possible within the technical
confines of the in vitro selection platform employed
(~ 1010 variants) [51]. It should be noted that practical
limitations do not allow for interrogation of all possible
mutational diversity, and that mutations conferring the
desired phenotype may have been missed. However, a
previous selection using the same methodology readily
identified point mutations in the N-terminal domain that
selectively abrogated binding by the small molecule Nutlin
[33]. In light of both this observation and the exceptional
structural mimicry of PM2, it appears highly unlikely that
mutation in HDM2 can selectively disrupt PM2 binding.
Further studies will confirm whether this observation can
be extended to other peptide-protein interactions.
Synthetic peptidic ligands are being developed
against a range of targets for therapeutic use. The results
presented here suggest that this emerging class of drug
will enable robust antagonism that is poorly ablated
through mutation of the target protein. This is potentially
of great relevance to the field of oncology, where clinical
resistance poses significant barriers to treatment efficacy.

NterHDM2 M62AC8 PET22b via mutagenesis with
M62AC8-revertQC1 and M62AC8-revertQC2. Single
mutant HDM2 clones were also generated by Quikchange
mutagenesis of 2ConA HDM2 PET22b or 2ConA
NterHDM2 PETb using appropriate primer pairs. The
same primers were used to introduce mutations into the
parental pCMV-HDM2 mammalian expression construct.

In vitro selection of HDM2 variants resistant
to PM2
IVT reactions consisting of 0.5μM ZnCl2, 10μM
PM2, p53 (10ng in preselection round, 10ng in round 1,
4ng in round 2, 2ng in rounds 3/4), library amplicons (5ng
in preselection round, 5ng in round 1, 2ng in round 2, 1ng
in round 3/4) in a total volume of 50µL PURExpress®
in vitro protein synthesis solution (New England Biolabs)
were assembled on ice and emulsified as previously
described [50, 51]. After incubation at 37°C, the reactions
were centrifuged at 8000rpm for 10mins to separate the
aqueous and oil phase. The oil phase was removed and
50uL PBS was added to the pellet of aqueous phase
compartments. The compartments were disrupted by
four rounds of hexane extraction and the aqueous phase
incubated with anti-HA antibody-coated protein G
beads (Invitrogen) at 4°C with rotation. During round
4, PM2 (1µM) was added during this step to increase
selection stringency. The beads were washed thrice with
PBST-0.1%BSA, and thrice with PBS. The beads were
resuspended in 20µl water and the protein-protein-DNA
complexes eluted by incubation at 95°C for 5mins. The
eluates were amplified with petF3 and HArevBamHI
during a primary amplification and with Hdm2-NdeI
and HArevBamHI during a secondary amplification. The
products were cloned back into 2ConA-PET22b via Nde1/
BamHI sites and re-amplified with petF2 and petR for the
next round of selection.

Vector and HDM2 library construction
2ConA NterHDM2 PET22b was created via inverse
PCR with primers Hdm2-Nter-noHA-R and HA-F on
2ConA HDM2 PET22b. Primers HDMM62A-1 and
HDMM62A-2 were used in QuikChange mutagenesis on
2ConA NterHDM2 PET22b to create 2ConA NterHdm2M62A PET22b. All of the above mentioned constructs
additionally encode a C-terminal HA tag.
Error-prone PCR was carried out on both 2ConA
NterHDM2 PET22b and 2ConA NterHDM2-M62A
PET22b using petF2 and petR and the mutant genes
re-amplified with Hdm2-NdeI and HArevBamHI. The
libraries were then ligated into 2ConA PET22b via Nde1/
BamHI sites and re-amplified with petF2 and petR to
produce library amplicons with T7 promoter and ribosome
binding site required for in vitro transcription/translation
(IVT), as well as the 2ConA RE site located before the T7
promoter site. p53-PET22b was also amplified with petF2
and petR for IVT of wild-type 53.
PM2 resistant parental clones obtained from the
selection were amplified with petF2 and petR to create
amplicons for secondary assays. M62AC8 parental
clone was amplified with infus-Mdm2-F and InfusM62AC8-Nter-R for cloning by infusion into 2ConA
HDM2 PET22b that was amplified with M62AC8Hdm2Nter-F and petATG-R to create full length 2ConA
HDM2 M62AC8 PET22b. The mutation M62A was also
removed from 2ConA HDM2 M62AC8 PET22b or 2ConA

Secondary co-immunoprecipitation assay and
western blot analysis
Protein G beads were incubated with anti-HA
(1µg per 10µL beads) for 1 hour in PBST-3%BSA and
subsequently washed thrice in PBST-0.1%BSA. IVTexpressed protein was incubated with the beads on a
rotator for 30 mins. PM2 was added at 100µM and
incubation carried out for 30 mins. IVT-containing
secondary protein was added to the mixture and incubation
allowed for 1 hour. Beads were finally washed thrice in
PBST-0.1%BSA and thrice with PBS, and bound proteins
eluted by resuspension in 20µL SDS-PAGE loading buffer
and incubation at 95°C for 5 minutes. Where required,
blank IVT extract (no template DNA added) was used as
control. The eluates were subjected to electrophoresis,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed for
p53 with DO1-HRP or for HDM2 with anti-HA antibody

cleaved protein eluted off the column with wash buffer.
Dialysis into buffer A solution (20 mM Bis-Tris, pH
6.5, 1 mM DTT) using HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column
was performed and the protein sample was subsequently
loaded onto a cation-exchange Resource S 1 mL column
(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. Six column
volumes of buffer A was used to wash the column and
the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient in
buffer comprising 1 M NaCl, 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, and
1 mM DTT over thirty column volumes. Protein purity
as assessed by SDS-PAGE was ~95%, and the proteins
were concentrated using Amicon-Ultra (3 kDa MWCO)
concentrator (Millipore).

Cell culture and reporter assay
Mouse embryonic fibroblast p53/Mdm2 doubleknockout (DKO) cells (a kind gift from Guillermina
Lozano) [58] were maintained in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) foetal calf
serum (FCS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. The
cells were seeded at 1.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates,
24 hours prior to transfection. Cells were co-transfected
with parental or individual PM2-resistant HDM2
plasmid, p53-pcDNA plasmid, LacZ reporter plasmid and
luciferase transfection efficiency plasmid using TurboFect
transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Nutlin and PM2 were added
to selected wells at required concentrations 4.5 hours posttransfection. In all cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA
transfected per well was equilibrated by addition of the
parental vector pcDNA3.1a (+).

Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay
Fluorescence anisotropy assays were performed
as previously described [3]. Titrations of purified wildtype and mutant HDM2 (1–125) were incubated with
50 nM of carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labelled 12-1
peptide (FAM-RFMDYWEGL-NH2) to determine the
dissociation constants for the peptide-protein interaction.
Apparent Kds of PM2 and human p53 peptide (AcQETFS DLWKLLPEN–NH2) were then determined
by competitive fluorescence anisotropy. Titrations of
PM2 and human p53 peptide were carried out with a
constant concentration of wild-type HDM2 at 150 nM,
mutant HDM2-F55L at 200 nM and the labelled peptide
at 50 nM. Anisotropy measurements were carried out
using the Envision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). All
experiments were carried out in PBS (2.7 mM KCl, 137
mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4),
3% DMSO and 0.1% Tween-20 buffer. All titrations were
carried out in duplicate (n = 3 to 9 independent titrations).
Curve fitting was carried out using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad).

β-Galactosidase assay and western blot analysis
DKO cells were harvested 24hours post transfection
and β-galactosidase activities were assessed using the
Dual-light System (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. β-galactosidase activity
was normalized with luciferase activity for each sample.
To check for expression levels of relevant proteins via
western blot, 5 µg of the cell lysates were probed for p53
with horseradish peroxidase conjugated DO1 antibody,
for HDM2 and actin with anti-HA antibody and AC15
antibody respectively followed by rabbit anti-mouse.

F2H co-localization assay

Protein expression and purification

Plasmids encoding the GFP-tagged bait p53 (amino
acids 1-81) fusion protein and different RFP-tagged
prey HDM2 (amino acids 7-134) fusion proteins were
co-transfected into transgenic F2H-BHK cells (F2HKit Basic, ChromoTek GmbH) [59] in 96 multiwell
plates (µClear Greiner Bio-One, Germany) using
the Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) reverse
transfection protocol according to manufacturer’s
instructions with 0.2 µg DNA and 0.4 µl Lipofectamine
2000 per well. 16 hours after transfection, cells were
treated with Nutlin (0-10 µM) or PM2 (0-50 μM) for 6-8
hours in serum-free DMEM at 37°C, 5% CO2. Interaction
(%) was determined as the ratio of cells showing colocalization of fluorescent signals at the nuclear spot to
the total number of evaluated cells. The INCell Analyzer
1000 with a 20X objective (GE Healthcare) was used
for automated image acquisition. Automated image
segmentation and analysis was performed with the

HDM2 (amino acids 1–125) was cloned as a GSTfusion protein using the pGEX-6P-1 GST expression
vector (GE Healthcare). QuikChange site directed
mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to create the mutant
HDM2-F55L (amino acids 1–125). The constructs were
then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
pLysS (Invitrogen) competent cells. Cells were grown
in LB medium at 37°C and induced at OD600 nm of 0.6
with 0.5 mM IPTG at 16°C. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation after overnight induction, resuspended in
binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl),
and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged
for 60 mins at 19,000xg at 4°C and applied to a 5 mL
GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in
wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM DTT). On-column cleavage by PreScission protease
(GE Healthcare) was carried out overnight at 4°C and the
