Considerable progress in research and clinical application has been made since
the original guidelines for managing mucositis in cancer patients were published
in 2004, and the first active drug for the prevention and treatment of this condition has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and
other regulatory agencies in Europe and Australia. These changes necessitate an
updated review of the literature and guidelines. Panel members reviewed the biomedical literature on mucositis published in English between January 2002 and
May 2005 and reached a consensus based on the criteria of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology. Changes in the guidelines included recommendations for
the use of palifermin for oral mucositis associated with stem cell transplantation,
amifostine for radiation proctitis, and cryotherapy for mucositis associated with
high-dose melphalan. Recommendations against specific practices were introduced: Systemic glutamine was not recommended for the prevention of gastrointestinal mucositis, and sucralfate and antimicrobial lozenges were not
recommended for radiation-induced oral mucositis. Furthermore, new guidelines
suggested that granulocyte–macrophage-colony stimulating factor mouthwashes

sustained efforts will be required to gain a fuller understanding of the pathobiology,
impact on overall patient status, optimal therapeutic strategies, and improved educational programs for health professionals, patients, and caregivers. These efforts

I

n 2004, the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer
(MASCC) and the International Society for Oral Oncology (ISOO) published 2 articles as a supplement
in the journal Cancer. The first article addressed the
pathogenesis, measurement, epidemiology, and consequences for patients of oral and GI mucositis1; the
second article provided evidenced-based clinical
practice guidelines for the management (prevention
and treatment) of the condition.2 However, few specific guidelines were possible based on the published
literature available at that time. We anticipated that
an updated review would be required approximately
every 3 years given the pace and direction of
advances in the field: The current report represents
the first such update.
Management strategies for oral and GI mucositis
increasingly are driven by key scientific advances.
These strategies are setting the stage for regulatory
approval of drugs and devices, which, in turn, provide opportunities for multidisciplinary expert panels
to produce evidence-based guidelines. Table 1 shows
the history of mucositis research over the last 40
years and delineates the temporal relations between
important developments in scientific discovery, pharmaceutical products, cancer treatment and supportive care, and related professional organizations,
conferences, regulations, protocols, and guidelines.
Such factors are likely to have had multidirectional
influence on the growth of this field, resulting in
incremental gains as well as sudden significant
advances.
Mucositis remains a morbid side effect of many
anticancer treatments. Alimentary mucositis (AM) is
a term we recommend to describe cancer therapyassociated mucosal injury of the alimentary tract
(mouth to anus). This unifying term acknowledges
the similarities along the entire GI tract while allowing for regional differences that require discussion
of oral and GI mucositis separately at times based
on pathophysiologic responses and clinical characteristics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Panel Composition
Our panel consisted of 30 mucositis-involved health
care professionals, including oral oncologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, surgeons,
nurses, dentists, dental hygienists, basic scientists,
epidemiologists, outcomes researchers, and a medical librarian.
Data Collection
Using the Ovid interface to Medline and a publication
time frame of January 2002 to May 2005, we retrieved
3974 articles, only 622 of which were of sufficient quality and relevance to be included in our final recommendations. At the time of the search, mucositis was
not a Medical Subject Heading (MeSH); thus, we
searched for mucositis as a text word in article titles and
abstracts. We also searched for the following terms to
identify all publications that had addressed mucositis:
stomatitis, a MeSH that we exploded to include related
terms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and stomatitis
(aphthous, denture, herpetic); mucous membrane, a
MeSH that we exploded to include related terms of gastric mucosa, goblet cells, intestinal mucosa, mouth mucosa, and respiratory mucosa.
We modified terms further with pathology,
pathophysiology, and radiation effects and injury to
narrow the retrieval to publications in which the mucosa was injured and to limit the search to specific
subject areas that were assigned to the various
reviewers. By exploding the MeSH term neoplasms,
we limited the search to neoplastic disease. Our final
step was to limit the retrieval to articles that were
written in English.
Literature Review
The medical librarian conducted separate literature
reviews, working closely with the group leaders for
each of 8 subject domains: 1) epidemiology, economics, and outcome; 2) pathogenesis; 3) terminology,
definition, and scales; 4) growth factors and cyto-

kines; 5) antimicrobials, mucosal coating agents,
anesthetics, and analgesics; 6) alternative and natural
therapies, laser, ice, etc; 7) basic oral care, bland
rinses, protocol development and education, and
good clinical practice; and 8) anti-inflammatory
agents and amifostine. Each group reviewed both
preclinical and clinical articles relating to the entire
alimentary tract. The systematic weighting of both
level and grade of evidence followed the same process that was used for the original guidelines based
on criteria of the American Society of Clinical Oncology that rated the level of evidence on a scale from I
to V and refined this by grading each recommendation from A to D.3,4 Level I evidence is reserved for
meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials or randomized trials with high power. Level II evidence
includes randomized trials with lower power, and
Level III evidence includes nonrandomized trials,
such as cohort or case-controlled series. Level IV evidence includes descriptive and case studies, and
Level V evidence includes case reports and clinical
examples. Grade A is reserved for Level I evidence or
consistent findings from multiples studies of Level II,
III, or IV evidence. Grade B is for Level II, III, or IV
evidence with generally consistent findings. Grade C
is similar to grade B but with inconsistencies; and
Grade D implies little or no evidence.

Guideline Development Based on Evidence
We distributed the publications in the finalized set of
literature to each group with instructions based on
methods for reviewing and scoring the literature
published by Hadorn et al.4 At least 2 panel members
reviewed each article. Preclinical studies were not
used to create guidelines per se; rather, they were
used as indicators of future directions for preclinical
and clinical studies. Each group presented its report
and draft of guideline revisions at a workshop in
Geneva, Switzerland on June 27 and 28, 2005. The
entire panel discussed each guideline to ensure that
it met the correct standards and to achieve a consensus (see Table 2). The current report includes the
new guidelines that were developed based on this
process. Each group also has published a companion
article in Supportive Care in Cancer5–17 that elaborates on the extent of preclinical and clinical literature in a particular area.
Conflict of Interest and Financial Disclosure
The costs for the workshop and for administrative
assistance in guideline preparations were paid from
unrestricted educational grants made to the Mucositis Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. No representatives

A suggestion is used for guidelines that are based
on Level III, Level IV, and Level V evidence; this implies
panel consensus on the interpretation of this evidence.
No guideline possible is used when there is insufficient
evidence on which to base a guideline; this conclusion
implies 1) that there is little or no evidence regarding the
practice in question, or 2) that the panel lacks a consensus
on the interpretation of existing evidence.

attended the workshop, nor were they allowed access
to the guidelines prior to publication. The guidelinedevelopment process was determined entirely by the
panel. Each panel member completed a conflict-ofinterest disclosure form that revealed all relationships with pharmaceutical companies that could be
affected by the development and publication of these
guidelines.

Future Plans
Revision plan
The panel will continue to review the literature every
2 to 3 years and will publish updates to guidelines as
necessary. The current process has created the opportunity for Web-based storage of the publication
inventory as well as for future reviews.
Outcomes assessment
In recognition of the importance and challenge of
disseminating and using these guidelines in clinical
oncology practice, the review team is considering cooperative strategies with other professional oncology
organizations as well as methodologies to assess the
scope and durability of the impact of the guidelines
on clinical practice.

RESULTS
Biologic Basis and Pathogenesis
Efforts to understand the biological basis for AM
include research of mechanism-based therapy, risk
prediction, long-term toxicity, and associations with
other side effects of cancer treatment. GI toxicities
from the targeted cancer therapies have yet to be
included in this field. It is likely that there are macroscopic factors as well as molecular or cellular factors
that are fundamental to the expression of GI toxicity,
that both categories are generic or specific,7 and that

they will provide opportunities for intervention. In
the future, it may be possible to predict an individual
patient’s risk of particular toxicities from radiotherapy and from each different chemotherapy or combination therapy. We recommend future research into
mucotoxicity that focuses on identifying its generic
and tissue-specific causes, analyzing its genetic components using genetic versus nongenetic controls,
and establishing evidence-based grading for and
hierarchical characterization of mucotoxicity.

Clinical Mucositis Assessment Scales
Advancements in terminology and in the assessment
of AM in patients receiving cytoreductive cancer
therapies have resulted in better patient management
practices and enhanced drug development to reduce
toxicity. Factors of note since publication of the original guidelines in 2004 include: 1) publication of the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 3.0,18 which defines a comprehensive, multimodality grading system for both acute and chronic
effects of cancer treatment; 2) implementation of the
term mucositis as a MeSH category, effective January
2006, which will improve future search capabilities
and increase the visibility of the term during related
searches (this change was a direct result of a recommendation to the National Library of Medicine in
February 2005 by the review group from the original
Mucositis Guideline Project and, thus, represents an
important outcome of the original project); 3) publication and presentation of additional models depicting the potential impact of oral and GI mucositis
relative to symptom clusters19–26 (although the mod-

els have continued to characterize oral and GI mucositis as a continuum of injury rather than biologically
and clinically independent toxicities,23,27,28 new models for the assessment of genetic risk for mucositis29
and the totality of impact for the condition23 may develop as research in this area progresses); 4) development of an epidemiological burden-of-illness study
by researchers from the Mucositis Study Group to
evaluate the impact of AM on patients after treatment
with standard-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; that study uses patient-reported outcome tools
to measure impact and investigates the relations
between various patient-reported toxicities as well as
the true regimen-related incidence and severity of
mucositis.30 The interrelated mucotoxicities are
shown in Figure 1.

Epidemiology and Outcomes
Methods for epidemiology review
Our literature searches did not identify any prospective studies of the incidence of mucosal toxicity associated with standard, multicycle chemotherapy for
common solid tumors. Therefore, we reviewed 99
recent clinical trials of standard chemotherapy regimens for non-Hodgkin lymphoma or breast, lung, or
colorectal cancer for incidence of severe (grade 3 or
4) oral mucositis, diarrhea, and esophagitis.8 We
aggregated the estimates of incidence using previously described methods1 and weighted the estimates based on the quality of the adverse event
reporting and the sample size for each trial. We
assigned quality points for the use of standardized
assessment scales, for blinded or independent

Incidence of mucositis associated with standard,
multicycle chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy)
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast,
lung, or colorectal cancers
Table 3 shows that standard chemotherapy regimens
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma occasionally have resulted in severe oral mucositis (3–10%) or diarrhea
(1–3%). Similar rates of AM are observed among
women who receive standard doxorubicin- and taxane-based regimens for breast cancer. Severe oral
mucositis and severe diarrhea are rare among

patients with lung cancer who receive platinumbased doublets and triplets, even when radiotherapy
is administered concurrently. However, among these
patients, severe (grade 3 or 4) radiotherapy-induced
esophagitis has been a major concern, occurring in
>15% of patients. Based on several studies8 that
included 280 patients, 18% (range, 14.2–22.9%) of
patients who receive carboplatin and paclitaxel plus
radiotherapy develop severe esophagitis. The risk of
severe esophagitis may be lower (10.6%; range, 2.1–
20.2%) among patients who receive amifostine;
although this estimate was derived from a single
study of 47 patients. Patients with advanced colorectal cancers who receive common chemotherapy regimens have a low risk of severe oral mucositis but a

826

high risk (16%) of diarrhea overall, which approaches
25% when both irinotecan and oxaliplatin are used.
Reports of newly emerging standards of care using
targeted therapies for lung and colorectal cancers fell
outside the time frame of the current review; thus,
the impact of these agents on the risk of mucosal
damage and diarrhea has yet to be described.

Updated Clinical Practice Guidelines for the
Care of Patients With AM
To provide clinicians with the current recommendations in a single document, the guidelines presented
in Table 4 represent the integration of the original
guidelines from 20042 plus the new guidelines developed at the Geneva workshop. The text below
addresses the guideline revisions only. The reader is
referred to the original Cancer supplement publication for more detail on the original guidelines.2
Basic oral care and good clinical practice principles
The results from a survey that was conducted by panel
members showed that incorporating management
guidelines into routine clinical practice will require the
successful dissemination and adoption of the guidelines, which can be achieved by educating relevant
target audiences.14 Barriers to such efforts include
challenges to dissemination, knowledge deficits, resistance to changing traditional practices, and a variety of
administrative issues.31 We have addressed some of
these barriers through a focus on education, qualityimprovement processes, and good clinical practices.
The panel suggests interdisciplinary development
of systematic oral care protocols that are geared toward the individual needs of the patient; educational
approaches to promulgating them that include the
patient, family, and staff; and quality-improvement
processes to evaluate them. It also suggests the use of
a soft-bristle toothbrush that is replaced on a regular
basis. A lack of research in these areas renders outcome assessment an extremely important component
of oral supportive care to document the benefits of
these practices. The updated guidelines also address
good clinical practices that should occur regardless of
the amount of research-based evidence.13
Guidelines. Based on expert opinion and the limited
published literature, the panel recommends the following: Regular assessment of oral pain is essential
and should be performed using validated, self-report
pain instruments. Topical anesthetics or other agents
should be considered to promote oral comfort. Initial
and ongoing assessment of the oral cavity is essential
using validated instruments that include both patient
self-report and professional examination. Use of a

preventive oral care regimen should be part of routine supportive care along with a therapeutic oral
care regimen if mucositis develops. Regular, systematic, oral care hygiene with brushing, flossing, bland
rinses, and moisturizers using a standardized oral
care protocol should be implemented for all patients.
It is noteworthy that an interdisciplinary approach to
oral care (nurse, physician, dentist, dental hygienist,
dietician, pharmacist, and others as relevant) will
provide the most comprehensive means of providing
supportive care. Dental examinations and treatment
are important prior to the start of cancer therapy for
all patients, especially for those with head and neck
cancer, and should continue throughout active treatment and follow-up.

recommendation). Despite the often postulated role
of infection in the pathogenesis of mucositis, no conclusive evidence for it has been published. Two new
studies of oral lozenges that contained polymixin,
tobramycin, and amphoteracin B or bacitracin, clotrimazole, and gentamicin showed no improvement
in the incidence or severity of radiation-induced
mucositis.32,33
Sucralfate
Guideline. The panel recommends that sucralfate not
be used for the treatment of radiation-induced oral
mucositis (Level II evidence, grade A recommendation). Sucralfate is a mucosal coating agent that has
been postulated to offer protection to the mucosa. All
studies have been negative in the radiation arena,
and the new randomized, controlled trial of sucralfate
in radiation treatment has confirmed this lack of benefit, showing no difference between micronized
sucralfate and salt and soda mouth washes.34
Amifostine
Guideline. The panel suggests that intravenous amifostine at a dose 340 mg/m2 daily prior to radiotherapy may prevent radiation proctitis in patients
who are receiving standard-dose radiotherapy for
rectal cancer (Level III evidence, grade B recommendation). Amifostine is an organic thiophosphate that
is used as a normal tissue protector during cytotoxic
therapy.35,36 Most of the amifostine studies that have
been published since the initial guidelines were
established have been small, single-center studies

TABLE 4
Summary of Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Care of Patients With Oral and Gastrointestinal Mucositis (2005 Update)
I. Oral mucositis
Basic oral care and good clinical practices
1. The panel suggests multidisciplinary development and evaluation of oral care protocols, and patient and staff education in the use of such protocols to reduce the
severity of oral mucositis from chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. As part of the protocols, the panel suggests the use of a soft toothbrush that is replaced on a
regular basis. Elements of good clinical practice should include the use of validated tools to regularly assess oral pain and oral cavity health. The inclusion of dental
professionals is vital throughout the treatment and follow-up phases.
2. The panel recommends patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as the treatment of choice for oral mucositis pain in patients undergoing HSCT. Regular oral pain
assessment using validated instruments for self-reporting is essential.
Radiotherapy: Prevention
3. The panel recommends the use of midline radiation blocks and 3-dimensional radiation treatment to reduce mucosal injury.
4. The panel recommends benzydamine for prevention of radiation-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer receiving moderate-dose radiation therapy.
5. The panel recommends that chlorhexidine not be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients with solid tumors of the head and neck who are undergoing radiotherapy.
6. The panel recommends that antimicrobial lozenges not be used for the prevention of radiation-induced oral mucositis.
Radiotherapy: Treatment
7. The panel recommends that sucralfate not be used for the treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis.
Standard-dose chemotherapy prevention
8. The panel recommends that patients receiving bolus 5-FU chemotherapy undergo 30 minutes of oral cryotherapy to prevent oral mucositis.
9. The panel suggests the use of 20 to 30 min of oral cryotherapy to decrease mucositis in patients treated with bolus doses of edatrexate.
10. The panel recommends that acyclovir and its analogues not be used routinely to prevent mucositis.
Standard-dose chemotherapy: Treatment
11. The panel recommends that chlorhexidine not be used to treat established oral mucositis.
High-dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation plus HCST: Prevention
12. In patients with hematologic malignancies who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation with autologous stem cell transplantation, the panel
recommends the use of keratinocyte growth factor-1 (palifermin) in a dose of 60 lg/kg per d for 3 d prior to conditioning treatment and for 3 d posttransplantation for the
prevention of oral mucositis.
13. The panel suggests the use of cryotherapy to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving high-dose melphalan.
14. The panel does not recommend the use of pentoxifylline to prevent mucositis in patients undergoing HSCT.
15. The panel suggests that GM-CSF mouthwashes not be used for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing HSCT.
16. The panel suggests the use of LLLT to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis and its associated pain in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy or
chemoradiotherapy before HSCT if the treatment center is able to support the necessary technology and training, because LLLT requires expensive equipment and
specialized training. Because of interoperator variability, clinical trials are difficult to conduct, and their results are difficult to compare; nevertheless, the panel is
encouraged by the accumulating evidence in support of LLLT.
II. GI mucositis
Basic bowel care and good clinical practices
17. The panel suggests that basic bowel care should include the maintenance of adequate hydration, and that consideration should be given to the potential for transient
lactose intolerance and the presence of bacterial pathogens.
Radiotherapy: Prevention
18. The panel suggests the use of 500 mg sulfasalazine orally twice daily to help reduce the incidence and severity of radiation-induced enteropathy in patients receiving
external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis.
19. The panel suggests that amifostine in a dose 340 mg/m2 may prevent radiation proctitis in patients who are receiving standard-dose radiotherapy for rectal cancer.
20. The panel recommends that oral sucralfate not be used to reduce related side effects of radiotherapy; it does not prevent acute diarrhea in patients with pelvic
malignancies undergoing external beam radiotherapy; and, compared with placebo, it is associated with more GI side effects, including rectal bleeding.
21. The panel recommends that 5-amino salicylic acid and its related compounds mesalazine and olsalazine not be used to prevent GI mucositis.
Radiotherapy: Treatment
22. The panel suggests the use of sucralfate enemas to help manage chronic radiation-induced proctitis in patients who have rectal bleeding.
Standard-dose and high-dose chemotherapy: Prevention
23. The panel recommends either ranitidine or omeprazole for the prevention of epigastric pain after treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU or
treatment with 5-FU with or without folinic acid chemotherapy.
24. The panel recommends that systemic glutamine not be used for the prevention of GI mucositis.
Standard-dose and high-dose chemotherapy: Treatment
25. When loperamide fails to control diarrhea induced by standard-dose or high-dose chemotherapy associated with HSCT, the panel recommends octreotide at a dose
100 lg subcutaneously, twice daily.
Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy: Prevention
26. The panel suggests the use of amifostine to reduce esophagitis induced by concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer.
HSCT indicates hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; 5-FU: 5-fluorouracil; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage–colony stimulating factor; LLLT: low-level laser therapy; GI, gastrointestinal.

with conflicting results that do not help to delineate
the role of amifostine in the reduction of mucositis.
However, 4 small studies on the prevention of proctitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for pelvic cancers all showed a reduction in symptoms, suggesting
that amifostine may help.37–40

Benzydamine hydrochloride
Although no new guideline is possible for benzydamine, because no new trials have been published
since the 2004 supplement, it is important to note
that a study in the United States sponsored by
McNeil had aimed to confirm the results of an earlier
randomized, placebo-controlled American/Canadian
multicenter trial41 on which the original guideline
was based. However, the McNeil study was stopped
early after the receipt of results from an interim analysis and the recommendations of the Data Monitoring Committee.
High-dose Chemotherapy With or Without Total-body
Irradiation Plus Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation: Prevention
Palifermin
Guideline. In patients with hematologic malignancies
who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy and total
body irradiation with autologous stem cell transplantation, the panel recommends the use of keratinocyte
growth factor-1 (KGF1) (palifermin) at a dose of
60 lg/kg per day for 3 days prior to conditioning
treatment and for 3 days post-transplantation for the
prevention of oral mucositis (Level I evidence, grade
A recommendation). In the previous review,2 clinical
studies on growth factors and cytokines for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis showed
inconsistent results, and there was not enough evidence to make any recommendations for clinical
practice guidelines.
Recombinant human KGF1 (fibroblast growth
factor 7 [FGF-7] or palifermin) is a member of the
FGF super class. Initially, the tissue-protective capacity of palifermin was attributed to its mitogenic
effect, which results in increased thickness of mucosal epithelium. However, palifermin also up-regulates
the expression of transcription factor Nrf2 in keratinocytes, which leads to the up-regulation of genes
that encode a series of reactive oxygen speciesscavenging enzymes.42 It stimulates the generation of
the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13),
which reduces tumor necrosis factor, a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of mucositis. In addition, palifermin exerts
antiapoptotic effects and reduces angiogenesis.43
Palifermin was used to prevent oral mucositis in 2

randomized, controlled studies. Prophylactic intravenous injections were given for 3 days prior to each
chemotherapy cycle in a Phase I study. Doses ranged
from 1 lg/kg per day to 80 lg/kg per day in 6 different cohorts, and 1 group of patients was given placebo. The drug generally was tolerated well in
biologically active doses, and the results suggested a
positive effect on oral mucositis.44 In a double-blind,
Phase III, multicenter study in which the effects of
palifermin were evaluated in 212 patients with hematologic malignancies who were undergoing a stomatotoxic conditioning regimen in preparation for
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT), the incidence and duration of clinically
meaningful oral mucositis was reduced significantly
in patients who were receiving palifermin. Palifermin
(60 lg/kg per day) or placebo was administered for
3 consecutive days immediately before the initiation
of myeloablation and on Days 0, 1, and 2 after transplantation. Palifermin also favorably affected the
incidence of blood-borne infections, the use of
parental opioids, and a variety of patient-reported
outcomes45 in a well-conducted, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

Cryotherapy
Guideline. The panel suggests the use of cryotherapy
to prevent oral mucositis in patients who are receiving high-dose melphalan (as a conditioning agent in
HSCT; Level II evidence, grade A recommendation).
Cryotherapy was recommended in the previous guidelines for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis in patients
who were receiving bolus 5-fluorouracil and possibly
etidronate (both drugs with short half-lives). Melphalan is another such drug, and the studies, although
small, showed consistent results in favor of using
cryotherapy,46,47 which obviously is a cost-effective
preventive strategy. For some patients, compliance
may be confounded by the physically uncomfortable
sensation they experience while holding ice in the
mouth for an hour.
Granulocyte–macrophage-colony stimulating factor
Guideline. The panel suggests that granulocyte–
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
mouthwashes not be used for the prevention of oral
mucositis in patients undergoing HSCT (Level II evidence, grade C recommendation). GM-CSF stimulates cells of the innate immune system in mucosal
tissues. GM-CSF for oral mucositis was evaluated in
4 studies48–51 with conflicting results. However, a
randomized, controlled study using a GM-CSF prophylactic mouthwash51 and another randomized,
controlled trial using a GM-CSF mouthwash as a

Updated Mucositis Practice Guidelines/Keefe et al.

treatment for oral mucositis in transplantation
patients who were receiving high-dose chemotherapy48 demonstrated no positive effects on the duration or severity of oral mucositis.

Standard-dose and High-dose Chemotherapy: Prevention
Systemic glutamine
Guideline. The panel recommends that systemic glutamine not be used for the prevention of GI mucositis
because of severe toxicity (Level II evidence, grade C
recommendation). Glutamine is an amino acid that
is a favored food of the GI tract. It is necessary for
cell mitosis. Multiple trials studying its effect on
mucositis prevention and treatment in various parts
of the alimentary canal have produced conflicting
results. Pytlik and colleagues performed a doubleblind, randomized trial in 40 bone marrow transplantation patients who received either intravenous alanyl-glutamine dipeptide or placebo52 and observed
that oral mucositis was more severe in the treatment
group, although diarrhea was reduced, suggesting a
differential effect down the GI tract. However, those
authors observed an increase in disease recurrences
in the glutamine group with a nonsignificant
increase in mortality at 2 years.

DISCUSSION
Major advances in the field of mucositis have
occurred over the past 3 years, including increased
understanding of the epidemiology and pathobiology
of the condition; a realization that symptom clusters
occur in patients, suggesting that genetic risk prediction for toxicity soon may be a reality; and the availability of new mechanism-based treatments. The
registration of palifermin and the recommendation
for its use in the prevention of oral mucositis in the
HSCT setting is a first in the field. Other drugs are in
development, and rapid progress finally is being
made in this under-appreciated area.
In the time after the endpoint for inclusion of
studies in the original guidelines (May 2002),2 the
pace of publication of mucositis studies has increased. However, the quality of these studies
remains variable, with many studies remaining small,
poorly designed, and, thus, unable to answer the
questions posed. Some of the recent studies indeed
are of high quality, and it is those studies that have
led to the important changes in the guidelines (Table
3). New agents continue to be developed. However,
the panel is unable to incorporate these agents into
the guidelines until peer-reviewed clinical studies
appear in the literature.48–51,53–56 Future guideline
reviews will address the outcomes of those studies.

829

Late-breaking Reports and Agents With Insufficient
Evidence for a Guideline
Human KGF2 2 (repifermin) has been withdrawn
from study because of poor performance in a Phase
II study. The reasons for the poor performance are
unclear and may relate to scheduling. It has been
reported in a Phase I trial that whey growth factor
extract reduced oral mucositis in the HSCT setting
compared with historic controls.56 Well-designed,
randomized, controlled trials are warranted before a
valid assessment of benefit can be made.
A single Phase III trial of Saforis (L-glutamine in a
proprietary oral drug-delivery system) recently showed
a reduction in oral mucositis among patients who were
receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy,57 but
further trials have been requested by the United States
Food and Drug Administration and are awaited.
RK-0202 is N-acetylcysteine in a proprietary
mouth rinse formulation that was studied recently in a
Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among
patients who were undergoing radiotherapy for head
and neck cancer. In that trial, RK-0202 significantly
reduced the incidence of oral mucositis (World Health
Organization and National Cancer Institute clinical
grade >2) by 29% (P ¼ .04) and 46% (P ¼ .005), respectively, compared with placebo.58
Lessons Learned and Future Directions
Updating the management guidelines for mucositis
has been a productive enterprise, reflecting the published evidence to improve clinical practice in mucositis management. The publication of guidelines is
only the first step toward ensuring that all patients
have access to evidence-based protocols for the
management of their potential mucositis. Work needs
to be done on promulgation of the guidelines; development of protocols that are based on them; education of patients, caregivers, and staff; and assessment
of outcomes from their use. Improved risk assessment needs to occur as well as continued research at
the basic and clinical levels into epidemiology, burden of illness, cost of care, prevention, and treatment.16 Most patients are not followed for toxicity
for sufficient duration in clinical trials; thus, these
problems largely are underestimated. Although progress is being made toward addressing some of these
areas, 2 important areas of assessment remain:
genetic-based risk and long-term toxicity. New
agents, such as palifermin, are expensive and cannot
be justified for prevention when the risk of severe
mucositis is low. However, if clinicians could predict
which patients on standard-dose treatments would
suffer mucositis, then the newer, more expensive
agents could be targeted in a cost-effective manner.

We anticipate that the new guidelines will need
updating in 2 or 3 years, and we look forward to
published studies on the burden of illness and risk
prediction as well as evaluations of strategies to
improve the uptake and use of the guidelines.
