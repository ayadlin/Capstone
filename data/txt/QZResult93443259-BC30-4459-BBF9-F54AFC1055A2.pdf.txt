Abstract
STAT3 is constitutively activated in colon cancer but its contributions in cancer-initiating cells have not been
explored. In this study, we characterized STAT3 in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive (ALDHþ) and
CD133-positive (CD133þ) subpopulations of human colon tumor cells that exhibited more potent tumorinitiating ability than ALDH/CD133 cells in tumor xenograft assays in mice. We found that ALDHþ/CD133þ
cells expressed higher levels of the active phosphorylated form of STAT3 than either ALDH/CD133 or
unfractionated colon cancer cells. STAT3 inhibition by RNA interference–mediated knockdown or smallmolecule inhibitors LLL12 or Stattic blocked downstream target gene expression, cell viability, and tumorsphere-forming capacity in cancer-initiating cells. Similarly, treatment of mouse tumor xenografts with STAT3
short hairpin RNA (shRNA), interleukin 6 shRNA, or LLL12 inhibited tumor growth. Our results establish that
STAT3 is constitutively activated in colon cancer–initiating cells and that these cells are sensitive to STAT3
inhibition. These ﬁndings establish a powerful rationale to develop STAT3 inhibitory strategies for treating
advanced colorectal cancers. Cancer Res; 71(23); 7226–37. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a tumor caused by abnormal division of
the cells lining the large intestine. According to the American
Cancer Society, there were an estimated 102,900 new cases and
51,370 deaths due to colorectal cancer in the United States in
2010. As such, there is a need for better treatment approaches
for colorectal cancer. The cellular mechanisms contributing to
colorectal cancer are still not well understood but involve
signaling protein dysregulation which includes the constitutive
activation of STAT3 (1–3). The constitutive activation of
STAT3 is frequently detected in primary human colorectal
carcinoma cells and established human colorectal cancer cell

lines (1–3), and elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation were
correlated with the tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and the
stage (P < 0.05; refs. 1, 3). Constitutive STAT3 activation in
colorectal cancer cells is associated with invasion, survival, and
growth of colorectal cancer cells and colorectal tumor model in
mice in vivo (2, 4–6). These reports indicate that STAT3 is one
of the major oncogenic pathways activated in colorectal cancer
and can serve as an attractive therapeutic target for colorectal
carcinoma. To date, however, whether STAT3 is activated in
colorectal cancer stem cells is unknown.
The concept of the cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating
cells holds that only a minority of cells within a tumor have the
ability to generate a new tumor. Cancer stem cells were
reported to show pluripotency and self-renewal (7). Cancer
stem cells were ﬁrst identiﬁed in leukemias and more recently
in solid tumors. Increasing evidence suggests that the cancer
stem cells concept is also relevant to colorectal cancer (8).
CD133, a transmembrane protein (Prominin-1 or AC133) was
used to isolate stem cells from a host of other normal and
cancerous tissues, including colorectal cancer. However, the
speciﬁcity of CD133 alone as a marker for colonic stem cells is
uncertain (9–11).
A promising new marker for cancer stem cells is aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1). ALDH is a detoxifying enzyme that
oxidizes intracellular aldehydes and thereby confers resistance
to alkylating agents (12). Corti and colleagues (13) showed that
ALDHþ cells isolated from murine brain were capable of selfrenewal and of differentiating into multiple lineages. Further
studies showed that ALDH1 is a speciﬁc marker for breast
cancer stem cells (14, 15). ALDH was also investigated as a
speciﬁc marker for identifying and isolating normal and malignant human colonic stem cells and as a way to quantify the
number of stem cells over the course of colon cancer

STAT3 in Colorectal Cancer–Initiating Cells

development (16). Xenograft tumors were successfully generated using ALDHþ cells from 7 primary colon cancer cells and
ALDH cells did not generate tumor xenografts (16). When
using ALDH and CD133 together to form tumor xenografts,
ALDHþ/CD133þ cells showed an increased ability to generate
tumor xenografts compared with ALDHþ/CD133 or ALDHþ
alone (16). Taken together, these data suggest that ALDH is a
better marker than CD133 for colorectal cancer stem cells.
However, using both ALDH and CD133 seem to be better than
to enrich the cancer stem cell population using ALDH or CD133
alone.
This study extends that work by using both ALDH and CD133
together as markers for cancer-initiating cells or colorectal
stem cells and examines the STAT3 phosphorylation and interleukin 6 (IL)-6 expression in these cancer-initiating cells. Our
results showed that colorectal cancer–initiating cells, characterized by ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colorectal cancer
cells expressing higher levels of STAT3 phosphorylation
and IL-6, compared with unseparated and ALDH/CD133
subpopulations. These results suggest that STAT3 is a novel
therapeutic target in colorectal cancer–initiating cells.

Materials and Methods
Colorectal cancer cell lines
Human colorectal cancer cell lines (SW480, HCT116, DLD-1,
and HT29) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). These
cancer cell lines have been routinely tested and authenticated
by the ATCC and Asterand, respectively. The known genotype
relative to adenomatous polyposis coli, beta-catenin, and DNA
mismatch repair enzymes (MLH1, MSH2) genes were shown in
Supplementary Table S1. ALDHþ/CD133þ cancer-initiating
cells were grown in a serum-free mammary epithelial basal
medium (MEBM; Clonetics division of Cambrex BioScience),
supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF (BD
Biosciences), 4 mg/mL Gentamycin (Invitrogen), 1 ng/mL
Hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mg/mL Insulin, and 100
mmol/L beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich).
STAT3 inhibitors, LLL12, and Stattic
The laboratory of Dr. Pui-Kai Li's at the Ohio State University
College of Pharmacy synthesized small-molecule LLL12 that
selectively targets STAT3 (17). Stattic, a previously reported
STAT3 inhibitor (18), was purchased from Calbiochem.
Isolation of colon cancer–initiating cells
The population with high ALDH enzymatic activity was
isolated by using the ALDEFLUOR Kit (StemCell Technologies)
as previously described (14). Brieﬂy, cells were trypsinized to
single cells and subsequently suspended in ALDEFLUOR assay
buffer containing ALDH substrate and then incubated for 40
minutes at 37 C. In all experiments, the ALDEFLUOR-stained
cells treated with diethylaminobenzaldehyde, a speciﬁc ALDH
inhibitor, served as ALDH-negative controls. Anti-human
PE-CD133 antibody were purchased from Miltenyi Biotec.
ALDHþ/CD133þ and ALDH/CD133 subpopulations were

separated from SW480, HCT116, DLD-1, and HT29 colon
cancer cells by a ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting Wantage
SE (Becton Dickinson) Flow Cytometry. After sorting, ALDHþ/
CD133þ cells were cultured in serum-free stem cell medium
(MEBM) to maintain cancer stem cell characteristics. ALDH/
CD133 and unseperated cells were cultured in regular medium and replaced with stem cell medium (MEBM) for 3 days
before harvesting.
Tissue microarray slides, immunohistochemistry, and
immunoﬂuorescence staining
Human colon cancer tissue microarray slides were obtained
from the Biochain Institute, Inc. and AccuMax ISU ABXIS Co.
containing 109 colon cancer cases. After baking and deparafﬁnization, the slides were boiled in a pressure cooker
ﬁlled with 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0) and then subjected to immunohistochemistry or immunoﬂuorescence
staining. Phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody (1:25; Signaling
Technology) and or ALDH1 (1:100; BD Pharmingen), CD133
(1:50; Miltenyi Biotec) were used. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated anti-mouse
IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) and the Histostain-Plus Kits
(Invitrogen) were used in immunoﬂuorescence or immunohistochemistry staining as described by the manufacturer.
Immunostained slides were scored under microscope by using
the criteria of percentage and intensity positive as described
previously by Ginestier (14). Signiﬁcance of correlation
between phospho-STAT3 and ALDH1 or CD133 was determined, respectively, using 2-sided Pearson x2 test. P < 0.05 was
considered as statistical signiﬁcance.
Cell viability assay
Colon cancer–initiating cells maintained serum-free MEBM
(3,000 per well in 96-well plates) were incubated with desired
concentrations of compounds in triplicate at 37 C for 72 hours.
MTT viability assay was done according to manufacturer's
protocol (Roche Diagnostics). The absorbance was read at
595 nm.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay
lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and subjected to
SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred on to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane and were probed with a 1:1,000 dilution
of antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) against phosphospeciﬁc STAT3 (Tyrosine 705; P-STAT3), phospho-independent STAT3, phospho-speciﬁc ERK1/2 (Threonine 202/Tyrosine 204), cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, cyclin D, survivin,
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
The degree of changes in P-STAT3 was determined using
densitometry and normalized to GAPDH.
Reverse transcriptase PCR
Total cell RNA was collected from cells by using RNeasy Kits
(Qiagen). cDNA was generated from 500 ng sample RNA using
Omniscript RT (Qiagen). Two microliter of cDNA was subsequently used for PCR using Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's instruction. Primer sequences

Table S2.
Tumorsphere culture
The ALDHþ/CD133þ cells was plated as single cells in ultralow attachment 6-well plates (Corning) and plated at a density of
25,000 viable cells per well. Cells were grown in a serum-free
MEBM as described above in a humidiﬁed incubator (5% CO2) at
37 C. At the second day after seeding, the ALDHþ/CD133þ cells
were treated with 2.5 to 5 mmol/L of LLL12 or 5 to 10 mmol/L of
Stattic. Tumorspheres were observed under microscope 15 days
later.
IL-6 ELISA assay
After sorting, ALDHþ/CD133þ and ALDH/CD133 cells
were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 12,000 viable cells
per well. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was collected
and the IL-6 concentrations were detected by using the Human
IL-6 ELISA Development Kit (Peprotech) as described by the
manufacturer.
Lentiviral infections
Lentivirus short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that speciﬁcally targets human STAT3 (19) and control lentivirus that expresses
green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) were provided by Dr. Antonio
Iavarone at the Columbia University. IL-6 shRNA lentivirus was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. STAT3, IL-6, or
control GFP shRNA lentivirus (CTL shRNA) was introduced
into SW480 and HCT116 colon cancer–initiating cells for 48
hours, followed by selection with puromycin (0.2 mg/mL) for 72
hours. Western blot assay was used to detect the expression of
P-STAT3 and STAT3 in colon cancer–initiating cells. MTT cell
viability and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay were
conducted and in vivo cancer-initiating cell growth was
determined.
Mouse xenograft tumor model
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the
principles and standard procedures approved by IACUC at the
Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital. For
tumor-initiation study, the ALDHþ/CD133þ or ALDH/
CD133 cells (1  102, 1  103, or 1  104) from SW480,
HCT116, DLD-1, and HT29 were mixed with 50% Matrigel
(Invitrogen) in a total of 100 mL and were injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank area of 4- to 5-week-old female
nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁciency
(NOD/SCID) mice, which were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The tumor incidence ALDHþ/CD133þ and ALDH/
CD133 cells are the numbers of tumor detected/numbers of
mice inoculated and were determined 50 days after the inoculation of cells in mice.
For shRNA lentivirus study, after sorting ALDHþ/CD133þ
HCT116, colon cancer–initiating cells (1  105) were infected
with STAT3, IL-6, or GFP shRNA lentivirus (CTL shRNA) for 48
hours. After 72 hours of selection with puromycin, cells were
mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks area of 4- to 5-week-old female NOD/
SCID mice. Tumor growth was determined by measured the

7228

Cancer Res; 71(23) December 1, 2011

length (L) and width (W) of the tumor every week with a caliper
and tumor volume was calculated on the basis of the following
formula: volume ¼ (p/6) LW2.
To detect the effects of STAT3 inhibitor LLL12 in vivo,
ALDHþ/CD133þ SW480 and HCT116 colon cancer-initiating
cells (1  105) were mixed with 50% Matrigel (Invitrogen) in a
total of 100 mL and were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂank
area of female NOD/SCID mice. After 17 and 19 days, SW480
and HCT116 mice were divided into 2 treatment groups
consisting of 5 and 6 mice per group, respectively: (a) dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) control vehicle and (b) 5 mg/kg of LLL12
(dissolved in 10% DMSO, 18% Cremophor EL and 72% sterile
5% dextrose). Tumor growth and body weights of mice were
measured every other day during 14 days period treatments. At
the end of treatments, tumors were harvested from euthanized
mice. A portion of tumor tissues was snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored in 80 C to examine the expression of
STAT3 phosphorylation by Western blot. The rest of tumors
tissues were dissociated mechanically and enzymatically to
obtain a single-cell suspension. The single-cell suspension was
used for ALDEFLUOR and CD133-PE staining and followed
ﬂow cytometry assay as previously described (20).

Results
LLL12 is a potent agent to inhibit the STAT3
phosphorylation in colorectal cancer cells
STAT3 is frequently activated in many types of human solid
and blood cancers and contributes to progression of those
cancers (21, 22). The STAT3 pathway is also frequently constitutively activated in colorectal cancer and is considered
to play an important role in colorectal cancer carcinogenesis
(1–6). To conﬁrm the important role of STAT3 in colon cancer
cells, the novel STAT3 inhibitor LLL12 (17) was used to target
STAT3 in 3 independent colon cancer cell lines using phosphospeciﬁc STAT3 antibody. Our results showed that LLL12
signiﬁcantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 705 (Y705, P-STAT3) in SW480, HCT116, and DLD-1
human colon cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). Phosphorylation at Y705 is important to activate STAT3 (23–25).
The inhibition of P-STAT3 by LLL12 is consistent with the
decrease of STAT3 downstream target genes and the induction
of apoptosis, as evidenced by the cleavages of caspase-3
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
ALDHþ/CD133þ cells exhibit more potent tumorinitiating ability than ALDH/CD133 cells in mouse
tumor xenografts
It has been shown that ALDHþ and CD133þ subpopulations
in colorectal cancer cells exhibit colorectal cancer–initiating
cells properties in vitro and in vivo (16). To verify whether
ALDHþ/CD133þ cells contain tumor-initiating ability, we separated ALDHþ/CD133þ and ALDH/CD133 subpopulations
from SW480, HCT116, DLD-1, and HT29 colorectal cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). The percentages of ALDHþ/CD133þ
in the 4 colon cancer cell lines were shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2B. Our results showed that although 5 to 8 of 7 to 8 mice
of 102 to 104 ALDHþ/CD133þ cells injected formed tumors,

STAT3 in Colorectal Cancer–Initiating Cells

only 1 to 2 of 7 to 8 mice of 103 ALDH/CD133 cells form
tumor, and none of the 102 ALDH/CD133 cells injected
formed tumor (Table 1). The volume of tumor formed by
ALDHþ/CD133þ are also larger than tumors formed by
ALDH/CD133 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taking together, these results suggest that using both ALDHþ and CD133þ
markers can enrich colorectal cancer–initiating cells. These
results increase our conﬁdence to isolate colorectal cancer–
initiating cells using both markers to examine the STAT3
phosphorylation.

there were 64.22% samples which had the similar expression,
much more than the samples with different expression of these
3 proteins (P < 0.05; Table 2). So there was a signiﬁcant
association between P-STAT3, ALDH1 and CD133. The representative examples of immunohistochemistry/immunoﬂuorescence staining of P-STAT3 and ALDH1/CD133 are shown
in Fig. 1B and C. These results from human colon cancer tissue
further showed that the elevated levels of P-STAT3 is expressed
in colon cancer–initiating cells. These results indicated that
constitutive STAT3 signaling may be a novel therapeutic target
in colorectal cancer–initiating cells.

The ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colorectal cancer
cells express higher levels of STAT3 phosphorylation
compared with the ALDH/CD133 subpopulation
The STAT3 phosphorylation of ALDHþ/CD133þ and
ALDH/CD133 subpopulations in SW480, HCT116, DLD-1,
and HT29 colorectal cancer cell lines were examined. Interestingly, our results showed that the ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of SW480, HCT116, DLD-1 (Fig. 1A), and HT29 (Supplementary Fig. S4A) colorectal cancer cells expressed higher
levels of P-STAT3 compared with unseparated cells and the
ALDH/CD133 subpopulation. ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Threonine 202/Tyrosine 204) was not at consistently high
levels in the ALDHþ/CD133þ cells in all 4 colon cancer cell lines
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S4A). These results suggested that
STAT3 pathway seems to serve a more important purpose in
colorectal cancer–initiating cells, but ERK may not play a key
role in colorectal cancer–initiating cells, at least in these 4
colorectal cancer cell lines. These results show that colorectal
cancer–initiating cells in the ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation
expresses phosphorylated or activated STAT3.
To further investigate the STAT3 activation in clinical colon
cancer samples, P-STAT3 and ALDH1, CD133 protein expression in human colon cancer tissues were also examined using
tissue microarray slides. We observed that there was a significant association (P < 0.01) between staining of P-STAT3 and
staining of ALDH1 (Table 2). In addition, the tumor samples
expressed elevated levels of phosphorylated STAT3 also associated with CD133 (P < 0.01; Table 2). In the 109 cases, there
were 32 samples (29.36%) in which P-STAT3 (Y705), ALDH1,
and CD133 were all positive, and 38 samples (34.86%) with
negative P-STAT3 (Y705), ALDH1, and CD133. Taken together,

STAT3 inhibitors, LLL12 and Stattic, inhibited STAT3
phosphorylation, and STAT3 downstream targets in
ALDHþ/CD133þ cells
To conﬁrm the important role of STAT3 in colon cancer–
initiating cells, we next examined the effect of STAT3 inhibitors, LLL12 and Stattic in SW480, HCT116, DLD-1, and HT29
colorectal cancer–initiating cells. The results showed that
LLL12 and Stattic inhibited P-STAT3 (Y705) but not ERK1/2
phosphorylation (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary Fig. S4B) in
ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colorectal cancer cell lines.
In Fig. 2B, Stattic seems to decrease STAT3 expression, which
could explain, in part, the observed decrease in level of
P-STAT3. In addition, STAT3 shRNA also inhibited P-STAT3
in ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colorectal cancer cell
lines compared with shRNA control (shRNA CTL; Fig. 2C).
The inhibition of STAT3 by LLL12 also downregulates the
expression of many known or putative STAT3-regulated
genes in colorectal cancer–initiating cells such as cyclin
D1 (26), survivin (27), Bcl-2, Bcl-XL (26), Notch1, and Notch3
(28, 29; Fig. 2D-a, Supplementary Fig. S4C). These genes are
related to cancer cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Moreover, the Notch pathway was reported to be
involved in self-renewal of human cancer stem cells and
tumorigenicity (28, 30). These results indicate that the LLL12
is also potent in terms of inhibiting P-STAT3, downregulating STAT3 downstream genes, and induces apoptosis in
these colorectal cancer–initiating cells. Furthermore, the
expression of STAT3 downstream genes, such as cyclin
D1, survivin, Bcl-XL, Notch1, and Notch3 were also reduced
by STAT3 shRNA (Fig. 2D-b).

LLL12 and Stattic inhibit cell viability and tumorsphereforming capacity of ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of

We next examined the inhibitory effects of LLL12, Stattic,

Fig. 5C and D). These results may be explained by at least 2
possibilities: Some (HCT116) or low (SW480 and DLD-1) levels
of P-STAT3 are expressed in ALDH/CD133 cells; Stattic and
LLL12 may also inhibit both P-STAT3 (Tyr705) and unphosphorylated STAT3 or nonnuclear function of STAT3 (31). The

The correlation of P-STAT3 (Y705) with ALDH1or/and CD133 (both positive or negative) was assessed by x2 test. P < 0.05 is
considered as statistically signiﬁcant. Colon cancer tissues from a total numbers of 109 cancer patients were examined.

inhibition of unphosphorylated STAT3 or nonnuclear function
of STAT3 in ALDH/CD133 cells might contribute to the
reduction of cell viability.
Furthermore, we examined the efﬁcacy of LLL12 and Stattic
in inhibiting colorectal cancer–initiating cells to survive and
proliferate in anchorage-independent conditions and ability to
form tumorspheres. Our results showed that LLL12 and Stattic
can inhibit tumorsphere-forming capacity in the ALDHþ/
CD133þ cells of SW480, HCT116, DLD-1 (Fig. 3D), and HT29
(Supplementary Fig. S4E) colorectal cancer cells. The effects of
LLL12 are more potent than Stattic. These results indicate that
LLL12 is an excellent drug candidate for targeting colorectal
cancer–initiating cells for inhibiting phosphorylated or activated STAT3 in human colorectal cell lines.
STAT3 inhibitors, LLL12 and Stattic, depleted ALDHþ/
CD133þ subpopulation and the expression of ALDH1,
CD133 in colon cancer cells
Colon cancer stem cells are resistant to current chemotherapy and radiation regimens available (8). To examine whether
STAT3 inhibition might eliminate the ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation, we treated cancer cells with 5 mmol/L of LLL12, 10
mmol/L of Stattic, 10 mmol/L of doxorubicin, and 10 mmol/L of
5-Fu for 24 hours, and sorted for the percentage of ALDHþ/
CD133þ subpopulation by ﬂow cytometry. Our results showed
that LLL12 could decrease the ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation
in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S6A), suggesting that this subpopulation of colon
cancer–initiating cells is sensitive to STAT3-mediated inhibition. We found that 10 mmol/L of Stattic also decreased the
percentage of ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S6A). However, 10 mmol/L of doxorubicin or
5-Fu increased the percentage of ALDHþ/CD133þ colorectal
cancer–initiating cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A), which might indicate
that colon cancer–initiating cells are resistant to chemotherapy. We also detected the effects of Dox or 5-Fu (10 mmol/L) in
STAT3 activation in the bulk tumor cell population (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The results showed different responses to
both drugs on P-STAT3 in 2 independent colon cancer cell lines
(SW480 and HCT116).
To further investigate the role of IL-6/STAT3 pathway in
ALDHþ/CD133þ colorectal cancer–initiating cells, ALDHþ/
CD133þ and ALDH/CD133 colon cancer cells were collected

www.aacrjournals.org

after sorting. ELISA assay showed that ALDHþ/CD133þ cells
secreted higher levels of IL-6 than ALDH/CD133 cells (Fig.
4B). Interestingly, the expression of IL-6, IL-6R, GP130, and IL-8
were higher in ALDHþ/CD133þ cells than ALDH/CD133
cells (Fig. 4C-a) as detected by RT-PCR assay. We also examined the ALDH1 and CD133 expression after the LLL12 treatment. We found that the expression of ALDH1 and CD133 was
lower after treatment with LLL12 (Fig. 4C-b). In addition,
LLL12 inhibited the expression of IL-6, GP130, and IL-8 (Fig.
4C-b). However, the expression of IL-6R was not changed
consistently in all 4 cell lines. Our data also observed that
IL-6 (25–50 ng/mL) induced the expression of IL-8 in SW480
and HCT116 colon cancer cells, which could be blocked by
LLL12 (Supplementary Fig. S6C). The results conﬁrm that the
IL-6/STAT3 pathway plays a central role in the maintenance of
the ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation in colon cancer cells.
IL-6 shRNA decreased STAT3 phosphorylation of
colorectal cancer–initiating cells in vitro and inhibited
cancer-initiating cell growth in vivo
To determine whether the increased levels of phosphorylated or activated STAT3 in ALDHþ/CD133þ cells is dependent
on upstream ligand, IL6, we treated ALDHþ/CD133þ cells with
lentiviral IL-6 shRNA versus control lentivirus without encoding IL-6 shRNA. Our results in Fig. 4D-a shows that lentiviral IL6 shRNA, but not control lentivirus, downregulated the phosphorylated STAT3. These results provide evidence that elevated levels of phosphorylated STAT3 in ALDHþ/CD133þ cells is
IL-6–dependent and the inhibition of IL-6 downregulates
phosphorylated STAT3.
To further show the tumor dependence on STAT3 and its
upstream activation (IL-6), we used shRNA that speciﬁcally
knock down STAT3 and its upstream signaling protein, IL-6.
Our results in Fig. 4D-b shows that STAT3 and IL-6 shRNA
signiﬁcantly suppressed colon cancer stem cell tumor growth
compared with lentivirus GFP (as a control). These data
supported tumor dependence on STAT3 and its upstream
activation by IL-6.
LLL12 suppresses tumor growth of colorectal cancer–

and tumorsphere growth in colorectal cancer–initiating cells

that LLL12 is potent in suppressing tumor growth from the

Discussion
STAT3 is frequently activated in many types of human
solid and blood cancers, including colon cancer (1–3, 22).

www.aacrjournals.org

Blocking signaling to STAT3 inhibits cancer cell growth,
showing that STAT3 is crucial to the survival and growth of
tumor cells (21, 22, 32) and is an attractive therapeutic target
for cancer. At the present time, the main effort to target
constitutive STAT3 signaling is only focused on the bulk of
cancer cells. No published literatures have been reported
about whether STAT3 is activated in colon cancer–initiating
cells, and no approach has been initiated to explore the
STAT3 as a possible therapeutic target in colon cancer–
initiating cells. In this article, we took a pilot study to explore

To explore the role thatSTAT3 plays in colon cancer–
initiating cells, we examined the effects of STAT3 inhibition.
Two small molecular STAT3 inhibitors, LLL12 (17) and
Stattic (18) were employed. LLL12 is a novel and more
potent derivative of LLL3, a previously reported STAT3
inhibitor from our laboratories (33, 34). Our results showed
that LLL12 was potent inhibitor to inhibit P-STAT3; STAT3

downstream targets expression and induces apoptosis in
nonseparated colon cancer cells. Importantly, STAT3 inhibitors, LLL12 and Stattic inhibited P-STAT3, STAT3 downstream gene expression, cell viability, and the formation of
tumorspheres in ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colon
cancer–initiating cells. In addition, STAT3 shRNA was used
to inhibit the STAT3 expression and activity. Our results
showed that STAT3 shRNA also inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, cell viability, and STAT3 downstream genes

expression in ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colon cancer–initiating cells.
We compared the expression of IL-6/STAT3 signal pathway, such as IL-6, IL-6R, GP130, and IL-8 between ALDHþ/
CD133þ and ALDH/CD133 subpopulations. IL-6 has been
shown to activate STAT3 (35) and may play a role in colon
cancer oncogenesis (36–38). Interestingly, our results showed
that ALDHþ/CD133þ cells expressed higher levels of IL-6,
GP130, and IL-8 and secreted higher levels of IL-6 than those
in ALDH/CD133 cells. In addition, introduction of the IL-6
shRNA in ALDHþ/CD133þ cells downregulated the expression of STAT3 phosphorylation. These results provide evidence that STAT3 activation in ALDHþ/CD133þ cells is IL-6
dependent. The expression of IL-6 and IL-8 could be reduced
by STAT3 inhibitor, LLL12. It was speculated that STAT3 may
regulate the expression of IL-6 (28). Our data showed that IL-6
is downregulated by STAT3 inhibitor, LLL12, supporting that
IL-6 may be regulated by STAT3. Furthermore, it has been
reported that activated STAT3 could selectively bind to IL-8
promoter and induce IL-8 transcription (39). Our data
showed that IL-6 induced the expression of IL-8, which could
be blocked by LLL12. These results suggest that IL-8 may be a
downstream target of IL-6/STAT3 in colon cancer cells.
Recent studies have suggested a role for interleukins, such
as IL-6 and IL-8, in breast cancer stem cells (15), which imply
that inﬂammatory microenvironment is important in promoting the oncogenesis. Ginestier and colleagues reported
that blockade of the IL-8 receptor CXCR1 selectively depletes
human breast cancer stem cells (40). Our data suggested that
IL-6/STAT3/IL-8 activation in colon cancer–initiating cells
might play an important role in the development of colon
cancer.
We found that the expression of ALDH1 and CD133 was
reduced after treatment with LLL12, and this may be due to
the inhibition of their expression. It may also be an effect of
LLL12 on cellular heterogeneity, whereby it decreases the
proportion of ALDHþ/CD133þ cells in the tumor cell population which was shown by our in vitro and in vivo data. In
addition, our data showed that STAT3 inhibitors, but not
other cancer therapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and 5Fu, eliminated ALDHþ/CD133þ subpopulation of colon cancer–initiating cells in colon cancer cell lines. These results
suggested that colon cancer–initiating cells, which are more
resistant to conventional drugs, might be sensitive to STAT3
inhibitors.
Furthermore, our results showed that STAT3, IL-6 shRNA
and LLL12 exhibited suppressive activity on the tumor growth
of human colon cancer–initiating cells derived from bulk colon

cancer cells. These results suggest that constitutive active
IL-6/STAT3 in these cancer-initiating cells enhanced proliferation and survival, as well as tumor growth in mice, whereas
STAT3 blockade by STAT3, IL-6 shRNA and LLL12, suppressed
tumor-initiating cell growth in vivo.
In summary, this study is the ﬁrst report to show that
IL-6/STAT3 is activated in colon cancer–initiating cells.
Targeting IL-6/STAT3 may be able to eliminate the colon
cancer–initiating cells and provides a promising approach to
treat advanced colon cancer. Our study also showed that
LLL12 is a potent STAT3 inhibitor for cancer-initiating cells
and is a promising drug candidate to target constitutive
STAT3 signaling in colon cancer–initiating cells. Most
recently, 2 literatures reported that IL-6/STAT3 pathway
may be activated in glioblastoma stem cells (41, 42). In
addition, targeting STAT3 by 2 small molecules, STA-21 and
S31-201 or IL-6 shRNAs, respectively, can inhibit cell viability
of these glioblastoma stem cells (41, 42). Furthermore, we
also observed that high levels of STAT3 phosphorylation are
detected in breast cancer–initiating cells compared with
unseparated and nonbreast cancer–initiating cells (data not
shown). These results are consistent with our observation in
colon cancer–initiating cells that activated STAT3 seems to
play an important role in cancer-initiating cells. It is also of
interest to investigate whether STAT3 is also activated in
cancer-initiating cells in other types of human cancer. If
STAT3 is constitutively activated in other types of cancerinitiating cells or cancer stem cells, it may open a new
therapeutic opportunity to target STAT3 in cancer-initiating
cells of those cancer types.
