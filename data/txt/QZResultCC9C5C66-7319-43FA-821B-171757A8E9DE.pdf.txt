individually or combined, have proven reliable (3) and there is
an urgent need to develop sensitive and specific screening tests
for the early detection, prognosis, and tailored clinical management of epithelial ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian tumors are
heterogeneous and include many different histopathologic subtypes: serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, undifferentiated,
or mixed, the serous type being the most common and the second
most lethal (4).
Cancer is in many ways a genetic disease and recent studies have
focused on differences in molecular profiling of gene expression
patterns to uncover diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as
new therapeutic targets in a variety of cancers. Although promising
results have been reported in some cancers, the genes that are
differentially expressed between normal and cancer cells vary
between individual microarray studies, reflecting either a variability
in methods and in the choice of model systems or heterogeneity in
selected tissues (5–7).
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, the production of distinct
mRNAs from a single gene, is a posttranscriptional process that
occurs in at least 70% of all genes to increase diversity of the
proteome (8). Alternative splicing can also introduce or remove
regulatory elements to affect mRNA translation, localization, or
stability (9, 10). Alternative splicing is tightly regulated during
development and between different tissues, and inherited and
acquired changes in pre-mRNA splicing patterns have been
associated with many human diseases (8, 11). Cancer-specific
alterations in splice site selection affect genes controlling cellular
proliferation (e.g., FGFR2, p53, MDM2, FHIT, and BRCA1), cellular
adhesion, and invasion (e.g., CD44, Ron); angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF);
apoptosis (e.g., Fas, Bcl-x, and caspase-2); and multidrug resistance
(e.g., MRP-1; refs. 12–16). Some of these changes can arise from
mutations at either the splice sites or within proximal splicing
enhancer or silencer elements or from perturbations of transacting splicing factors (8). Examples of trans-acting factors that
affect alternative splicing in cancer include ASF/SF2, PTB, and
SRPK1 (17–20). Indeed, staining with PTB antibody was higher in
invasive ovarian tumors than low malignant potential tumors and
even lower in benign tumors (19). Thus, investigating cancerspecific splice variants may accelerate the discovery of novel
diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers, as well as identifying
potentially new drug targets.
The first hints that global alternative splicing patterns were
altered in cancer came from computational efforts designed to
exploit collections of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases
(reviewed in ref. 21) some of which were subsequently validated by
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; ref. 22). Since then, there has
been a concerted effort to annotate alternative splicing globally
with oligonucleotide-based microarray technologies. Arrays with
alternative splice junction probes have been used to detect splicing

Abstract
Intense efforts are currently being directed toward profiling
gene expression in the hope of developing better cancer
markers and identifying potential drug targets. Here, we
present a sensitive new approach for the identification of
cancer signatures based on direct high-throughput reverse
transcription-PCR validation of alternative splicing events.
This layered and integrated system for splicing annotation
(LISA) fills a gap between high-throughput microarray studies
and high-sensitivity individual gene investigations, and was
created to monitor the splicing of 600 cancer-associated genes
in 25 normal and 21 serous ovarian cancer tissues. Out of
>4,700 alternative splicing events screened, the LISA identified
48 events that were significantly associated with serous
ovarian tumor tissues. In a further screen directed at 39
ovarian tissues containing cancer pathologies of various
origins, our ovarian cancer splicing signature successfully
distinguished all normal tissues from cancer. High-volume
identification of cancer-associated splice forms by the LISA
paves the way for the use of alternative splicing profiling to
diagnose subtypes of cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(3):657–63]

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer and the deadliest among gynecologic pelvic malignancies. Early symptoms of ovarian cancer are often mild and
unspecific, making this disease difficult to detect. In most cases, at
the time of diagnosis, cancer cells have already disseminated
throughout the peritoneal cavity. In fact, more than 70% of patients
are diagnosed with late-stage disease and only a minority survive
more than 5 years postdiagnosis (1), but early detection offers a
90% 5-year survival rate (2). Inability to detect ovarian cancer at an
early stage and its propensity for peritoneal metastasis are largely
responsible for these low survival rates. Currently, there are no
reliable methods for detecting early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.
The CA125 serum marker combined with transvaginal ultrasonography are the usual clinical tests offered to screen for early stages
of ovarian cancer in high-risk populations. These tests are used as
predictors of clinical recurrence of ovarian cancers, and to monitor
response to anticancer therapy. Neither of these strategies,

using a PowerMax homogenizing system equipped with a 10 mm saw tooth
blade (VWR International). Extracted RNA was isopropanol precipitated,
then resuspended in pure water and stored at 80jC. RNA concentration
was quantified on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
Tissue quality control for the training set was established using realtime PCR amplification of known genes with known cancer or tissue
type–specific expression profiles, including the epithelial cell markers
KRT7, KRT18, and CDH1; the stromal marker vimentin; and the tumor
cell content indicator hTERT (primer sequences available on request).
KRT7, KRT18, and CDH1 were shown to be up-regulated in high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (29, 30). Expression data for all tissues used in
the validation screen was subjected to unsupervised clustering using the
R package.4 Four tumor tissues that failed, this quality control were
considered to have low tumor tissue content and were omitted from the
study. Eight normal and eight tumor RNA samples showing expression
data closest to the median for each gene expression level for the normal
or tumor tissue type were selected and combined in equal amounts to
formulate two normal and two tumor pools of four samples each. No
tissue quality control was performed on the blinded set.
Primer and PCR experiment design. For the 600 genes in this study,
the AceView transcript set was mapped into the LISA database and the
LISA automatically generated a splicing map (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Concurrently, the LISA applied a modified Primer-3–based (31) algorithm
for the automated design of PCR primers for all exons in the transcript set.
PCR experiments flanking all possible exon-exon junctions were designed.
In addition, alternative splicing events were covered by at least two
independent reactions. Where possible, the design was such that predicted
amplicon sizes fell within the 100 to 400 bp range. The lower limit of 100 bp
was set to avoid an overlap with primer and primer-dimer signals. Primers
were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies in 96-well plates on a
10 nmol scale.
RT-PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Reverse transcription was
performed on 2 Ag total RNA samples in the presence of RNase inhibitor
according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Reactions were primed with
both (dT)21 and random hexamers at final concentrations of 1 and
0.9 Amol/L, respectively. The integrity of the cDNA was assessed by SYBR
green–based quantitative PCR, done on three housekeeping genes: MRPL19,
PUM1, and GAPDH (primer sequences available on request). C t values for
these genes, typically in the range of 14 to 25, depending on the gene, were
used to verify the integrity of each cDNA sample. Following qPCR, the
samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to ensure that only one
amplicon of the expected size was obtained.
End-point PCR reactions were done on 20 ng cDNA in 10 AL final volume
containing 0.2 mmol/L each dNTP, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.6 Amol/L each
primer, and 0.2 units of Taq DNA polymerase. An initial incubation of 2 min
at 95jC was followed by 35 cycles at 94jC 30 s, 55jC 30 s, and 72jC 60 s.
The amplification was completed by a 2-min incubation at 72jC. Relative
quantitation using this method was verified for six alternative splicing
events by comparison with isoform-specific quantitative PCR, and was
found to be in strong agreement, to within 5% in all cases (data not shown).
PCR reactions are carried out using a liquid handling system linked to
thermocyclers, and the amplified products were analyzed by automated
chip-based microcapillary electrophoresis on Caliper LC-90 instruments
(Caliper LifeSciences). Amplicon sizing and relative quantitation was
performed by the manufacturer’s software, before being uploaded to the
LISA database.
Database, design, and analysis modules. The LISA was built around
the LAMP solution stack of software programs (Linux operating system,
Apache web server, Mysql database management server, and Perl and
Python programming languages). In addition, several peripheral Perl and
Python modules for experimental design, analysis, and display of results
interact with the LISA. Statistical t tests and unsupervised clustering
were performed using the R package.4 The capillary electrophoresis

changes in Hodgkin’s lymphoma (23), breast cancer cell lines and
xenografts (24), colon cancer (25), brain tumors (26), and leukemia
(27). A related medium-throughput technique (Dasl) has been used
to show that alternative splicing analysis can complement the
power of gene expression analysis of prostate tumors (24).
Microarray studies produce lists of putative alternative splicing
events that must subsequently be validated by RT-PCR and usually
only very few events are identified with high confidence. Indeed,
the typical output of cancer-based studies is usually in the order
of 10 validated alternative splicing events. Therefore, despite the
low confidence in the accuracy of global gene expression signatures
identified in ovarian cancer (5), classic gene expression remains
the standard tool to distinguish ovarian tumors from normal
tissues (28).
We report here the development of an automated highthroughput RT-PCR platform named the LISA (layered and
integrated system for splicing annotation) capable of performing
and analyzing 3,000 reactions per day. Using this integrated
bioinformatics/robotics infrastructure, we have comprehensively
analyzed alternative splicing in a set of 600 genes representing
many confirmed cancer-associated genes or <4% of the human
transcriptome. The sensitivity of this analysis led to the discovery
of 48 highly cancer-specific splicing events. This set of potentially
highly significant and biologically relevant splicing differences
makes up a strong signature for epithelial ovarian cancer samples
and amounts to a considerable augmentation of our knowledge of
cancer-specific alternative splicing.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. All reagents were purchased from VWR International with the
exception of the following: TRIzol reagent and Platinum Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen Canada, Inc.), Omniscript reverse transcriptase
(Qiagen, Inc.), deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP; GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences, Inc.), Power SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems), and Porcine RNAguard RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.
For capillary electrophoresis, RNA Nano chips and reagents were obtained
from Agilent Technologies, and SE-30 DNA chips and reagents were
obtained from Caliper LifeSciences.
Tissue sourcing and RNA extraction. Normal and serous epithelial
ovarian cancer tissue samples were obtained as frozen specimens from the
Réseau de Recherche sur le Cancer du Fonds de la recherche en santé du
Québec biobank. Histopathology, grade, and stage were assigned according
to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics criteria. From
the 21 serous ovarian cancer tissues used as the training set, 20 were
obtained from stage III and one tissue from stage I disease (Supplementary
Table S1). Only chemotherapy-naı̈ve tumor samples were used for the
training set. Normal ovarian tissues were selected from women undergoing
oophorectomy for reasons other than ovarian cancer, and the normality of
the ovaries was confirmed by standard pathology tissue examination.
Normal ovaries with benign tumors or cysts were excluded. Most of the
donors were postmenopausal women of the age group when most serous
tumors develop. Tumor and normal tissues were obtained from similar age
group patients. For normal ovary tissues, age ranged from 39 to 84 years
whereas the serous ovarian cancer tissues ranged from 42 to 79. The
blinded set of 29 tumor and 10 normal tissues included 5 serous carcinomas, 1 serous benign tumor, 4 mixed carcinomas, 6 endometriod
carcinomas, 2 mucinous carcinomas, 3 serous low malignant potential
tumors, 2 mucinous low malignant potential tumors, 1 undifferentiated
adenocarcinoma, 1 teratoma, and 4 serous carcinomas of possible
extraovarian origin (Table 1). For this set, no exclusion based on age or
exposure to chemotherapy was made. RNA was extracted from 50 mg tissue
samples using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol,

NOTE: Blind test of serous ovarian cancer alternative splicing markers. Thirty-nine normal and ovarian tumor tissues of the varying pathologies and
origins indicated were classified based on their alternative splicing profile using the nearest centroid prediction rule (see Materials and Methods).
Samples were designated normal or cancer depending on the shorter Euclidian distance (indicated in arbitrary units) to the normal or cancer centroid.

P values are used in the screening process to determine cancer specificity.
Reactions showing a greater than 10 percentage point difference between
the mean W values for normal and tumor pools were selected for the
validation screen. Following the validation screen, W values were used in a
t test for significant differences between normal and tumor tissue
samples. Reaction sets with Bonferroni-corrected P values <0.0002 were
selected.
Blinded set test. Tumor/normal class prediction was based on the
‘‘nearest-centroid prediction rule’’ (32). In brief, we defined two average
profiles (tumor and normal) as vectors of the average W values of the 48
alternative splicing events based on the clustering of the 46 samples. The
sample was assigned a class label based on the smallest Euclidean distance
between the sample and either one of the two average profiles.

instrument software provides size and concentration data for the
detected peaks of each PCR reaction. These data are uploaded to the
LISA database and compared with expected amplicon sizes for that
experiment using a signal detection protocol and are thus stored in the
LISA database with their corresponding concentrations as ‘‘assigned’’ or
‘‘unassigned’’ amplicons. In addition, gene sequence, primer sequence,
single nucleotide polymorphism sites, and protein coding data are linked
to each element of experimental data stored in the database. For each
PCR reaction covering an alternative splicing event, the analysis module
uses the concentration data from all RNA sources under consideration to
determine the most prevalent assigned amplicon. For each RNA source,
the ratio of the concentration of this amplicon to the total assigned
amplicon concentrations measured is calculated and is expressed as a
percentage, termed the percent splicing index, W. W values for normal

Layered and integrated system for splicing annotation. We
have developed a system that provides unbiased systematic and
comprehensive monitoring of splicing events, without relying on
elaborate mathematical modeling for interpretation. The LISA is an
automated high-throughput RT-PCR platform capable of executing
3,000 reactions per day, allowing a daily analysis of 750 alternative
splicing events from four RNA sources (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To identify cancer-associated splicing events, we first generated a
list of 600 candidate genes from a keyword search for ‘‘ovarian
cancer,’’ ‘‘breast cancer,’’ and ‘‘DNA damage’’ in the National Center
for Biotechnology Information Entrez Gene database. These genes
were entered into the LISA for the identification of alternative
splicing events and experimental design. A transcript map for each
gene was generated (Supplementary Fig. S1B) from publicly
available mRNAs and ESTs, and sets of PCR primers and experiments were designed such that all putative exon-exon junctions and
alternative splicing events were covered by at least two distinct PCR
reactions. A total of 4,709 alternative splicing events were identified
and an average of 33 primers and 30 PCR reactions were designed
per gene. Most primer pairs (96%) amplified the expected products
and this low failure rate was further offset by having at least two
separate primer pairs overlapping each region. PCR amplification
and subsequent capillary electrophoresis revealed the tissuespecific splicing patterns (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The percent
splicing index (denoted W) was then calculated and plotted as a
heat map to show splicing changes across the tissues, and
alternative splicing events showing significant changes were flagged
(see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1D). The
different tools used for annotation and visualization of alternative
splicing differences between different tissue samples are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2.
Comparative profiling of splicing events in normal and
serous epithelial ovarian tumor tissues. As outlined in Fig. 1, we
performed a screen in two stages: the first termed the ‘‘discovery
screen’’ and the second, the ‘‘validation screen.’’ The discovery
screen was carried out using two pools of RNA extracted from highgrade (grades 2 and 3) serous epithelial ovarian cancer specimens
and two pools of RNA extracted from unmatched normal ovary
sections (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S1).
Each pool contained an equivalent mix of four independent tissues.
Screening of the two cancer and two normal pools identified
potentially cancer-associated alternative splicing events in 98
different genes. The range of shifts in W values for these candidates
was 10% to 70%. All results from the discovery screen are available
as supplementary material.5 Alternative splicing events identified
in the discovery screen were reexamined in a validation screen on
individual RNA samples extracted from 21 serous epithelial ovarian
cancer (grades 2 and 3) and 25 normal ovary sections. Overlapping
PCR reactions using RNA from each tissue were carried out as in
the discovery screen confirming the association of 48 alternative
splicing events in 45 genes with ovarian cancer tissues. Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the distribution of W values for the 48 hits
and for 16 reactions that passed the discovery screen, but were not
significantly cancer associated in the validation screen. Supplementary Table S2 presents the details of each of the 48 significant
cancer-associated events issued from the validation screen. This

their individual and collective capacity to accurately differentiate
between normal and cancer tissues. The variance in the splicing
pattern of each of the 48 identified ovarian cancer-associated
splicing events (Supplementary Table S2), as calculated by their W
value, was used to classify the 46 individual and 4 pools of normal
and tumor tissues based on splicing similarity (Fig. 2). Strikingly,
all tumor tissues clustered together.
To evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the newly identified
splicing signature, we blindly examined a set of 39 normal and
ovarian tumor tissues of varying pathologies and origin, including
benign tumors, low malignant potential tumors, and carcinomas of
various histologic types (no prior tissue content quality control was
used to select this group of tissues). The samples were processed as
before using the LISA platform and the tissues were classified
based on their alternative splicing profile using the nearest

expression levels of a random selection of 11 genes with cancerassociated alternative splicing events were determined by quantitative PCR. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, expression levels
varied <5-fold between the pools of the same type. In fact, for all
gene measurements of expression levels in this sample, variation
was within an order of magnitude, precluding the possibility of
significant end point PCR measurement biases. Indeed, we did
not detect any correlation between shifts in alternative splicing
and expression levels in this data set, and conclude that expression
and cancer-specific alternative splicing are distinctly regulated,
as suggested previously for tissue-specific transcription and
alternative splicing (33).
Use of alternative splicing to diagnose ovarian cancer. To
assess the potential of the alternative splicing events identified by
the LISA as diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer, we evaluated

regions that are alternatively spliced. The EDB region is
preferentially included in lung cancer (36), whereas the EDA region
is preferentially included in liver cancer (37). The EDB and EDA
exons are usually excluded in adult tissues with a major exception
being ovary. Consistent with this, we found cancer-specific
exclusion of the EDB exon. Interestingly, a recent splicing
microarray study in colon cancer also found cancer-specific
exclusion of EDB (25). Another known cancer-specific splice
occurs to the a exon of FGFR1, which is specifically removed in
glioma (38). By contrast, we found cancer-specific inclusion of this
exon, as well as of the homologous exon of FGFR2. Alternative
splicing of the FGFR2 a exon has not been correlated with cancer
before but intriguingly a recent genome-wide study associated its
upstream intron with an increased risk of breast cancer (39).
Alternative splicing of the SYK tyrosine kinase has been associated
with breast cancer (40) and we found the same splicing shift in
ovarian cancer. We also found alternative splicing of DNMT3B in
ovarian cancer, in the same region, but a different isoform from
that previously found in hepatocellular carcinoma (41). That short
DNMT3B isoform (42) is lacking part of the catalytic DNA
methyltransferase domain, including the TRD loop previously
shown to be important for cytosine recognition (43), and is
therefore inactive. The alternative splicing event in KITLG also
affects function. In this case, the skipped exon encodes a
metalloprotease cleavage site that determines whether KITLG will
be membrane bound or secreted (44). The transmembrane form is
more active in promoting cell-cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and
survival because it induces more persistent tyrosine kinase
activation than the secreted isoform (45).
Cancer-specific splicing events may drive cancer or may be a
result of it (46). Another possibility is that cancer-specific splicing
(and/or gene expression) reflects the tissue of origin. In an attempt
to determine which applies to ovarian cancer, we studied primary
cell cultures from normal ovarian surface epithelium tissues for our
identified cancer-specific isoforms and found an equal representation of normal and cancer-specific events (Supplementary
Table S2), implying that about half of our identified events may
be truly cancer specific, whereas the other half may reflect the
epithelial origin of the cancer (47). However, this interpretation
remains uncertain as cells derived from normal ovarian surface
epithelium tissues often adopt mesenchymal-like morphology due
to their high degree of plasticity (48). Thirty-four hits (70%) are
alternative splicing events that produce in-frame alterations
(Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that alternative splicing of
these genes contributes to ovarian tumor biology by creating
proteins with novel or antagonistic functions (16). To extend this
utility of alternative splicing events as markers, it will be of interest
to correlate these with clinical variables in larger cohorts of
patients who have suffered from serous epithelial ovarian cancer as
well as other histopathologic subtypes.

centroid prediction rule (see Materials and Methods). By considering the shortest distance to either the normal or the cancer
centroid, all 10 normal specimens were classified as normal. All the
endometrioid (six of six), all mixed malignant cancers ( four of
four), and two of four mucinous cancers were correctly classified.
The other two mucinous carcinomas, which were low malignant
potential tumors, were classified as normal. Seven of the 11
malignant serous cancers were classified as cancer (Table 1).
Interestingly, for the four malignant serous carcinoma tissues that
were not classified as cancer, pathology could not define a clear
ovarian origin. These tissues may have originated from an
extraovarian source such as primary peritoneal carcinomatosis.
The three serous low malignant potential tumors included in this
study were classified as cancerous. The only serous benign tumor
was classified as normal (Table 1). These data therefore confirm the
utility of the alternative splicing signature as a general identifier of
epithelial ovarian cancer and show the potential and sensitivity of
this approach as a cancer subtype classifier.

Discussion
In the current study, we have used the LISA to provide highquality comprehensive annotation of alternative splicing for
600 genes in 46 different tissues. Our analysis required nearly
100,000 RT-PCR reactions that were automatically carried out in a
relatively short time. We based our comprehensive primer design
on the AceView database as it has the most comprehensive EST
coverage (34). In comparison with AceView, only 65% and 45% of
our hits were represented in the smaller, curated, UCSC, and
RefSeq databases, respectively. The fact that the AceView database
is near complete for our purposes was tested by an extensive
search through our data for novel cancer-associated splice events.
One possible explanation for the lack of novel sequences recovered
by this query is that we concentrated on well-known genes. It is
possible that novel cancer-specific splicing events could be
discovered in less well annotated genes.
In this study, we have shown that alternative splicing patterns
can distinguish normal ovary from epithelial ovarian cancer. The
number of cancer-specific splicing events identified exceeds the
average number of events that is normally identified by splicing
microarray profiling (25). The accuracy and applicability of the
newly identified alternative splicing signature was shown by its
capacity to identify ovarian cancer tissues (Table 1). The
signature identified all normal tissues in a blinded set of 39
specimens, and 80% of the diverse cancer tissues regardless of
their histologic subtypes. All cancer tissues that were identified
as normal could be either of very low epithelial content, from an
uncertain ovarian origin (Table 1), or possibly from an unknown
tumor biology.
Our results identify some expected genes and many surprises; in
ovarian tumors specifically, three genes have been reported to be
regulated at the level of splicing. The splicing of the multidrug
resistance protein ABCC1 (MRP1) and the p53 regulator MDM2
have both been shown to be disrupted in ovarian cancer and a
large selection of internal deletions were found (12, 19, 35). The
incapacity of the LISA to detect these previously reported
alternative splicing events is possibly due to the preset stringency
of the screen design, which was set to detect only events that are
found in >25% of samples. Among our novel markers for ovarian
cancer were several alternative splicing events that have been
associated with other cancers. Fibronectin is known to have three
