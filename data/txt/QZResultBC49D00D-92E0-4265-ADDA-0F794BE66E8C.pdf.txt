Abstract
The potential to heighten the efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic agents
was explored in this study based on active targeting of tumor cells
overexpressing the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor
(GnRH-R). The rational design pursued focused on ﬁve analogues
of a clinically established antiangiogenic compound (sunitinib),
from which a lead candidate (SAN1) was conjugated to the
targeting peptide [D-Lys6]-GnRH, generating SAN1GSC. Conjugation of SAN1 did not disrupt any of its antiangiogenic or
cytotoxic properties in GnRH-R–expressing prostate and breast
tumor cells. Daily SAN1GSC treatments in mouse xenograft
models of castration-resistant prostate cancer resulted in significant tumor growth delay compared with equimolar SAN1 or
sunitinib alone. This efﬁcacy correlated with inhibited phosphor-

ylation of AKT and S6, together with reduced Ki-67 and CD31
expression. The superior efﬁcacy of the peptide–drug conjugate
was also attributed to the ﬁnding that higher amounts of SAN1
were delivered to the tumor site (4-fold) following dosing of
SAN1GSC compared with equimolar amounts of nonconjugated
SAN1. Importantly, treatment with SAN1GSC was associated with
minimal hematotoxicity and cardiotoxicity based on measurements of the left ventricular systolic function in treated mice.
Our results offer preclinical proof-of-concept for SAN1GSC as
a novel molecule that selectively reaches the tumor site and
downregulates angiogenesis with negligible cardiotoxicity, thus
encouraging its further clinical development and evaluation.

Introduction

prostate cancer using a conjugate of a GnRH peptide linked to
the cytotoxic drug gemcitabine (7). These studies were inspired
by evidence of a doxorubicin-based conjugate (AN152) that has
now advanced to the phase III clinical trials for various solid
malignancies (8, 9).
The GnRH-R is primarily located in the pituitary gland (10, 11)
but upregulation of its expression has been reported in prostate,
breast, and other cancers (10, 12) which persists despite prolonged exposure to GnRH agonists (6). Interestingly, an antiproliferative role has also been reported for GnRH, providing additional opportunities for the treatment of tumors by directly
affecting cancer cells apart from the pituitary (13, 14).
Tumor growth depends on the ability of new vessels to
sprout in a process called angiogenesis. Numerous antiangiogenic agents have been developed which inhibit the phosphorylation of certain receptors like the VEGFR types 1/2 and
platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR-a/b; ref. 15).
A typical example of a clinically successful antiangiogenic agent
is sunitinib, an orally available small molecule that inhibits
phosphorylation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
including VEGFRs-1/2, PDGFR-a/b, KIT, and FLT3, with an
average IC50 below 100 nmol/L (16, 17). Clinical trials of
sunitinib in tumors, such as prostate (18) and breast cancer
(19) were initiated on the basis of successful preclinical evidence (16, 20) but were halted in phase III, despite prolongation of progression-free survival, due to the lack of statistically
signiﬁcant overall survival in patients. Experience with sunitinib in the clinic demonstrated that a considerable subset of
sunitinib-treated patients develop left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and overt heart failure (21, 22).

The concept of generating novel cancer therapeutics that
target speciﬁc cell surface receptors has been a driving force of
drug development over the past few years (1–3). This idea is
based on the evidence that certain cell surface receptors in
malignant cells are either mutated or overexpressed (e.g., EGFR,
HER2/neu, GnRH-R), compared with normal cells (4–6) and
that these alterations provide "druggable" opportunities. We
recently demonstrated the successful targeting of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) in GnRH-R–positive

On the basis of the ﬁndings of the above studies, we surmised that increased speciﬁcity of sunitinib delivery at the site
of action through conjugation to a targeting agent may lead to
improved efﬁcacy while minimizing peripheral toxicities. We
decided to pursue this concept by generating novel GnRHbased molecules conjugated to sunitinib, with the prospect of
exploiting the additional antiproliferative effects of the GnRH
peptide itself.
Conjugation of sunitinib to a targeting group is challenging
due to the possibility of altering the potency and pharmacokinetics of the pharmacophore. Few groups have experimented
with the generation of sunitinib analogues (23–29), based on
cocrystallization studies (30) that revealed indolin-2-one core
as the moiety of the drug involved in kinase inhibition. Substitutions at the C4 position might serve as a handle for
improving pharmaceutical properties as shown by toceranib
(26). On the basis of the above structure–activity relationship
studies, some sunitinib analogue conjugates have been synthesized and evaluated either as imaging tools (27) or as lysozymebased targeting agents (25), but to our knowledge no conjugation to a peptide moiety has been reported.
Herein, we present the results of preclinical studies for a
GnRH–sunitinib–based conjugate (called SAN1GSC), generated after the evaluation of various novel sunitinib analogues
(designated as SANs 1-5). The analogues were designed to be
linkable to a variety of peptides while maintaining their antiangiogenic properties, a desired feature that expands their
translational applications. Enhanced efﬁcacy, minimal toxicity,
and improved biodistribution properties of SAN1GSC were
shown, in comparison with its unconjugated derivative (SAN1)
or sunitinib.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, synthesis, and characterization of compounds
Sunitinib was purchased from Selleckchem and [D-Lys6]-GnRH
from Proteogenix. All other chemicals and biologicals, unless
stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The synthesis of SAN1-SAN5 (Fig. 1A) and of SAN1GSC (Fig. 4A) is
presented in the Supplementary Information section (Supplementary Information Sections S1 and S3). All molecules were
analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain the key spectral
features necessary for their quantiﬁcation in blood and tissue as
described previously (7, 31). Total polar surface area and clogP
values were predicted by Chemdraw Ultra (v10, PerkinElmer
Informatics).
Computational methods
Detailed docking and molecular dynamic analysis for all the
compounds was performed as described in the Supplementary
Information Section S2.
In vitro evaluation of compounds
The trans-phosphorylation activity of VEGFR-2, PDGFR-b, KIT,
FLT3, ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), and EGFR was
evaluated as described before (17). Detailed methods and a list of
the kinases used are available in the Supplementary Information
Section S4. Cellular inhibition of autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 and PDGFR-b was performed as described previously (32).
Detailed methods are available in the Supplementary Information Section S5. For cellular studies, cells were used within 6

A Potent Sunitinib–GnRH Conjugate for Tumor Targeting

was obtained from ATCC and human umbilical vein endothelial
cell (HUVEC) from Life Technologies. The DU145, PC3, and NIH/
3T3 cells were authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling
(Microsynth). WPE1-NB26-3 cells were a kind gift from Prof.
Robert Millar (University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa).
Pharmacokinetic analysis
All animal procedures were approved by the Bioethical Committee of BRFAA based on the European Directive 86/609. Equimolar (17 mmol/kg) dosing solutions for each compound were
prepared in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin in water (HP-bCD), except for SAN1GSC that was solubilized in saline. All
compounds were administered intraperitoneally in male NOD/
SCID mice (8–10 weeks, n ¼ 4, from Charles River Laboratory)
and blood samples were collected and prepared as described
previously (7).
In vivo efﬁcacy of sunitinib, SAN1, and SAN1GSC
NOD/SCID mice were injected in each ﬂank with 3  106
DU145 cells, a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell
line. Treatment was initiated when tumors reached 200 mm3 by
daily i.p. administrations of sunitinib or equimolar doses of SAN1
(100 mmol/kg). Control mice received saline or HP-b-CD. In
separate experiments, mice were treated with equimolar amounts
(9.17 mmol/kg) of SAN1GSC, SAN1, and [D-Lys6]-GnRH. Mice
were weighed regularly and phenotypic signs of discomfort were
monitored as described in the Supplementary Information Section S6. Experiments were terminated after approximately 20
days, at 1 hour or 2 hours after the last administered dose by
euthanizing the animals under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Tumors
were excised, weighed, and prepared for histopathology, IHC,
kinase activity, and quantiﬁcation of compounds by LC/MS-MS.

using the Student two-tailed, two-sample unequal variance distribution t test.

Results
Synthesis of SANs
The synthetic route for SANs 1-5 is shown in Fig. 1A. These
modiﬁed versions of sunitinib maintain the RTK inhibition
indolin-2-one core while, in addition, they provide a handle for
conjugation to a targeting peptide. Figure 1B depicts the MS
features as well as some key properties for all SANs. Although
the lipophilicity of sunitinib variants (SANs 1-5) was decreased
compared with sunitinib, the polar surface area remained unaffected (<100 Å2) for all SANs, a parameter known to inﬂuence cell
membrane permeability (35). A representative mass spectrum
and LC/MS-MS chromatogram for a chosen analogue (SAN1) can
be found in Supplementary Information Section S2.
Molecular docking calculations
Molecular docking calculations were performed for the synthesized SANs based on the catalytic domain of three key kinase
receptors: VEGFR-2, PDGFR-b, and KIT. Estimated inhibition
constants Ki (Fig. 2A) were in the low nanomolar range, similar
to the estimated values of sunitinib. A representative molecular
model of SAN1 complexed with VEGFR-2 is shown in Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Information Section S3.
Biochemical kinase assays
The potency of all SANs was experimentally evaluated in biochemical assays against puriﬁed VEGFR-2, PDGFR-b, KIT, and FLT3
and presented in Fig. 2B. All SANs inhibited the speciﬁc RTK targets
with IC50 values ranging from 20 to 150 nmol/L comparable with
sunitinib. The EGFR served as a negative control (concentrations
up to 10 mmol/L did not inhibit EGFR phosphorylation).

IHC
Excised tumors were ﬁxed in neutral buffered formalin, parafﬁn
embedded, sectioned, and stained against CD31, Ki-67, pS6, and
pRPS6KB1. Microvessel density was assessed by counting the
number of CD31-positive vessels in a 40 microscope ﬁeld in
a blinded fashion and presented as the amount of blood vessels/
mm2. Cell proliferation was measured by counting Ki-67–positive
cells in a 40 microscope ﬁeld. Images were acquired by a Leica
DFC350-FX camera mounted on a Leica DMLS2 microscope.

Cellular ligand–dependent phosphorylation assay
The inhibition of phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-b,
was further conﬁrmed in HUVEC and NIH/3T3 cells, using a
Western blot analysis based cellular ligand–dependent phosphorylation assay. The calculated cellular IC50 value for sunitinib was
24  12 nmol/L (for VEGFR-2) and 72  19 nmol/L for PDGFR-b,
respectively. Similar potencies were observed for all SANs with
cellular IC50 values ranging from 52 to 180 nmol/L (Fig. 2C).

In vivo kinase activity
The PathScan RTK signaling array kit (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as per the manufacturer's direction to detect the
phosphorylation status in supernatants from tumor extracts (n ¼
10 for each treatment). Images were analyzed with ImageJ software (v1.28) by loading the image as a grayscale picture. Each
kinase array dot was manually selected, normalized, and an
average intensity for each kinase was calculated as described
previously (33).

Cytotoxicity studies
The antiproliferative effect of the ﬁve SANs was assessed in three
GnRH-R–positive prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, WPE1NB26-3) and one GnRH-R–positive breast cancer cell line
(HCC1954), in HUVEC and NIH/3T3 cells. Results and comparative IC50 values are presented in Fig. 2D. SAN1 proved highly
potent in HUVEC and DU145 cell lines (IC50s: 8  4 mmol/L and
11  2 mmol/L, respectively), SANs 2-4 showed intermediate
efﬁcacies whereas SAN5 appeared inactive (IC50 > 100 mmol/L)
and was discarded from further evaluation.

Toxicity evaluation
Cardiotoxicity was evaluated through echocardiography as
described previously (34) and is mentioned in Supplementary
Information Section S7. Hematotoxicity was assessed as described
in the Supplementary Information Section S8.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses and calculation of all IC50s were performed
by SigmaPlot 12 software. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined

Pharmacokinetic evaluation
The most promising molecules (SANs 1–4) were evaluated for
their pharmacokinetic parameters in mice. Sunitinib maximum
blood concentrations were achieved at 0.25 hours (1.5 mmol/L)
with an AUC0–8h of 2.51 hours  mmol/L. Similarly, SANs 1–4
were rapidly absorbed reaching highest blood concentrations
averaging in the range of 0.5 to 2.1 mmol/L at 0.25 to 1 hour
after dosing (Fig. 2E). After dosing, concentrations of SAN1

peaked at 0.25 hour with an AUC0–8h: 1.11 hours  mmol/L. Signs
of discomfort were observed in mice that received SAN2, discouraging further evaluation. According to the biochemical assays,
compound concentrations of approximately 100 nmol/L were
needed for the inhibition of the target kinases (Fig. 2A–C). After
intraperitoneal dosing, such levels could be sustained for 4 hours
postdose for all the molecules tested. A single intraperitoneal
administration of an efﬁcacious dose of sunitinib (100 mmol/kg)
was the point of reference for subsequent efﬁcacy studies in mice
(Fig. 2E). On the basis of the described pharmacokinetic and
biologic readouts combined with its facile synthetic route, SAN1
was selected as the lead candidate compound for follow-up
efﬁcacy studies in mice.
In vivo antitumor efﬁcacy of SAN1
Mice bearing established DU145 tumors were treated with each
molecule at 100 mmol/kg/day (equivalent to 40 mg/kg). A signiﬁcant tumor growth delay was observed in all mice treated with
sunitinib (Fig. 3A), with the average tumor size at day 19 at 312 

123 mm3 and an average tumor weight of 0.20  0.08 g compared
with 1,181  105 mm3 (P < 0.0001) and 0.87  0.51 g (P ¼ 0.005)
for vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3B). Tumor growth delay was also
observed in DU145 xenografted mice treated with equimolar
SAN1 (Fig. 3A), with an average tumor size at day 19 of 455  137
mm3 (P < 0.001 compared with vehicle-treated mice). The corresponding average tumor weight at sacriﬁce was 0.37  0.19 g for
SAN1 (Fig. 3B, P ¼ 0.005 compared with vehicle-treated mice).
Concentrations of sunitinib and SAN1 in blood and tumor tissue
were measured at 2 hours after the ﬁnal dose. Blood concentrations of the sunitinib were 4.7  0.1 mmol/L, whereas levels at
tumor tissue were 11.0  5.0 mmol/L (Fig. 3C). The values for
SAN1 in the tumor tissue were signiﬁcantly lower at 0.4  0.2
mmol/L, but exceeded the IC50 level threshold (100 nmol/L)
determined for the inhibition of phosphorylation of the target
kinases. It should be noted that sunitinib is more lipophilic
compared with SAN1 (as evident in their clogP values), a property
that explains the higher drug accumulation in the tumor tissue
over the treatment period.

A Potent Sunitinib–GnRH Conjugate for Tumor Targeting

In vivo target modulation studies
Insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for the
observed in vivo efﬁcacy of SAN1 were obtained by histologic,
immunohistochemical, and target modulation analysis of tumors
harvested from treated and untreated animals. Hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections were evaluated by an independent histopathologist who conﬁrmed that the features of the
tumors were consistent with a Gleason score 10, prostatic acinar
adenocarcinoma (Fig. 3D). Tumors were composed of malignant
epithelial cells distributed in solid sheets without glandular formations. The nuclei were pleomorphic, vesicular, and contained a
prominent nucleolus. Isolated mitotic ﬁgures were noted. Immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies against Ki-67 and
CD31 showed a marked reduction in cell proliferation and
reduced angiogenesis in sunitinib-treated mice and SAN1-treated
mice (Fig. 3D). The Ki-67–assessed proliferation indices (PI) of
mice treated with the compounds of interest were as follows: for
sunitinib (100 mmol/kg): 9.1  3.3% (P < 0.001, treated/untreated PI ratio ¼ 0.176), for SAN1 (100 mmol/kg): 16.8%  3.1% (P <
0.001, treated/untreated PI ratio ¼ 0.325), and for vehicle-treated
animals: 51.7%  6.5%. In addition, for CD31, the average
number of CD31þ cells of mice treated with sunitinib at 100
mmol/kg and mice treated with SAN1 at 100 mmol/kg versus
vehicle-treated mice were 5.3  2.2, 6.8  1.6, and 34.5  8.9,
respectively.
A marked downregulation of pAKT (Ser473), pS6, and pSTAT1
was noted when the phosphorylation status of 39 kinases was
investigated in extracts of tumor tissue in drug-treated versus
vehicle-treated mice, consistent with the multikinase phosphorylation inhibition ability of sunitinib and the designed SAN1
analogue (Fig. 3E).
Generation of SAN1GSC
On the basis of the in vivo efﬁcacy proﬁle, SAN1 was selected
for conjugation to the [D-Lys6]-GnRH–targeting peptide by
utilizing the free hydroxyl group of SAN1. Prior experience
(7) allowed us to implement a succinate linker strategy for
SAN1 to [D-Lys6]-GnRH, resulting in the SAN1GSC molecule as
shown in Fig. 4A and Supplementary Information Section S3.
Molecular docking calculations indicated that SAN1GSC could
bind to the target receptors with a predicted Ki ¼ 28 nmol/L for
VEGFR-2, Ki ¼ 65 nmol/L for PDGFR-b, and Ki ¼ 51 nmol/L for
KIT (Fig. 4B).
In vitro evaluation of SAN1GSC
Incubation of SAN1GSC with VEGFR-2, PDGFR-b, KIT, and
FLT3 resulted in the inhibition of phosphorylation of each of the
above kinases with respective IC50 values of 97  41, 91  36, 74
 36, and 37  6 nmol/L (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis
indicated that SAN1GSC inhibited the phosphorylation of
VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-b, with nanomolar potency (38  12
nmol/L for VEGFR-2 and 76  17 nmol/L for PDGFRb, Fig. 4D). Finally, SAN1GSC was equipotent to SAN1 in terms

of cellular toxicity in various cell lines with the calculated IC50
ranging from 9 to 18 mmol/L (Fig. 4E).
The SAN1GSC-mediated GnRH-R activation of the pERK1/2
signaling pathway was investigated by setting up an indirect
method based on the WPE1-NB26-3 cell line. Incubation of
WPE1-NB26-3 cells (stably modiﬁed to overexpress the GnRHR) with SAN1GSC resulted in a robust phosphorylation of ERK1/2
similar to a result observed when the same cells were stimulated
by [D-Lys6]-GnRH or GSG (lanes 1-3 in Fig. 4F). Such an effect was
absent when cells were pretreated with a GnRH-R antibody (Fig.
4G), suggesting that pERK1/2 activation was a result of direct
binding of SAN1GSC to the GnRH-R.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation of SAN1GSC
Intraperitoneal administration of 17 mmol/kg of SAN1GSC in
mice led to conjugate blood concentrations averaging 20 nmol/L
at 0.25 hours (Fig. 4H). Circulating concentrations of SAN1
formed from the catabolism of SAN1GSC peaked at 0.5 hours
with a Cmax of 181 nmol/L at 0.5 hour and an AUC0–8h: 0.53 hour
 mmol/L. The described experiment indicated that following
dosing of SAN1GSC in mice, pharmacologically critical concentrations of SAN1 (exceeding 100 nmol/L) could be achieved in
circulation. It should be noted that the pharmacokinetics of
SAN1GSC generating adequate (but low) concentrations of SAN1
sustained over time, was in contrast with the high Cmax (1100
nmol/L), resulting from the dosing of unconjugated SAN1, a
potential risk factor for peripheral toxicity.
In vivo antitumor efﬁcacy of SAN1GSC
Mice bearing established DU145 tumors were dosed with
equimolar amounts of SAN1GSC, SAN1, sunitinib, and
[D-Lys6]-GnRH for a period of 20 days. Tumor growth delay was
evident in all mice treated with SAN1GSC (Fig. 5A and B), with an
average tumor volume at day 20 of 689  102 mm3 signiﬁcantly
smaller in comparison with SAN1 (1,010  114 mm3, P < 0.001)
and sunitinib-treated mice (1197  248, P < 0.001) or for mice
treated with [D-Lys6]-GnRH (1248  108 mm3, P < 0.001). On day
20, the average tumor weight for SAN1GSC-treated mice was 0.50
 0.11 g compared with 0.75  0.33 g for SAN1, (P ¼ 0.038 vs.
SAN1GSC), 0.91  0.27 g for sunitinib, (P ¼ 0.003 vs. SAN1GSC),
and 0.82  0.22 g for [D-Lys6]-GnRH–treated mice (P ¼ 0.003 vs.
SAN1GSC). All treatments were well tolerated with no noticeable
body weight loss or overt toxicity compared with the vehicle group
(Supplementary Fig. S5). To investigate whether SAN1GSC dosing increased the drug payload to the tumor site, concentrations of
SAN1, and of SAN1 derived from SAN1GSC administration, were
determined in blood and tumors in samples obtained 1 hour
postdose after day 20 of treatment (Fig. 5C). Measurements of
SAN1 at the tumor tissue revealed approximately four times
higher SAN1 in SAN1GSC-treated mice compared with SAN1treated mice (113  35 vs. 31  8 nmol/L), with a tumor/blood

considered statistically signiﬁcant.

In vivo target modulation studies
Histologic examination of H&E sections revealed a poorly
differentiated high Gleason prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis in tumor sections using antibodies against Ki-67 and
CD31 showed a marked reduction in cell proliferation and
reduced angiogenesis in SAN1GSC-treated compared with SAN1,
sunitinib or [D-Lys6]-GnRH–treated mice (Fig. 5D). The Ki-67–
assessed PI of mice treated with SAN1GSC were 21.5%  2.7%,
(P < 0.001, treated/untreated PI ratio ¼ 0.416), for SAN1 51.9% 
3.7% (P > 0.01, treated/untreated PI ratio ¼ 1.005), and for
sunitinib 51.5  3.9% (P > 0.01, treated/untreated PI ratio ¼
0.998), respectively. The average number of CD31þ cells in tumor
sections of mice treated with SAN1GSC were 12.7  3.5, for SAN1
32.14  11, for sunitinib 30.03  7, and for [D-Lys6]-GnRH 28.1 
5.4 (Fig. 5D). Finally, results from the panel of 39 kinases revealed
a marked downregulation of pAKT (Ser473), pERK1/2, and pS6
only in SAN1GSC-treated mice compared with all other treatments (Fig. 5E). We performed immunohistochemical analysis
on tissue sections of treated mice against the pS6 protein, in
parallel with its activating kinase (RPS6KB1). Reduced levels of
phosphorylation were observed for both proteins only in the
SAN1GSC-treated mice (Fig. 5F). Direct inhibition of RPS6KB1
from SAN1GSC was subsequently veriﬁed in a cell-free assay, with
a calculated IC50 of 337  72 nmol/L (Fig. 5G).
Toxicity evaluation of SAN1GSC
The cardiotoxicity of sunitinib (29, 30) was assessed and
compared with treatment with SAN1GSC, SAN1 by measurements of the cardiac LV function in C57BL/6 mice. Initially, we

veriﬁed that cardiotoxicity related to sunitinib becomes established and reaches a plateau, at 1 week after treatment. This effect
was observed at the efﬁcacious (100 mmol/kg) and the nonefﬁcacious dose of sunitinib (9.17 mmol/kg) but not in vehicle,
as measured by the percentage of fractional shortening (FS)
change from baseline measurements (Fig. 6A and B). One week
of daily intraperitoneal equimolar administrations of SAN1GSC
and SAN1 demonstrated that SAN1GSC had a minimal, nonsigniﬁcant reduction in the percentage of FS compared with its
baseline levels (from 46.79  0.55 to 44.99  0.73) as opposed
to a statistically signiﬁcant percentage of FS reduction following
equimolar dosing of SAN1 (from 48.22  0.46 to 46.29  0.60,
P ¼ 0.01) or equimolar dosing of sunitinib (from 46.35  0.70 to
42.58  0.62, P ¼ 0.0001) as shown in Fig. 6C.
Hematologic analyses of drug-treated C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that SAN1GSC did not affect white blood cell (WBC)
populations, with only a mild erythrocytosis observed in [D-Lys6]GnRH and SAN1GSC-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Thus, SAN1GSC was the least toxic of the molecules evaluated
under the described conditions.

Discussion
The active targeting of GnRH-R–expressing tumors with GnRHbased therapeutics is a promising ﬁeld in the area of personalized
treatment. Such a strategy may overcome off-target toxicity in
tandem with continuous efﬁcacy due to persistent expression of
the GnRH-R on prostate cancer cells, despite prolonged exposure
to GnRH agonists (6). A better understanding of prostate cancer

Argyros et al.

microenvironment biology (36) and the central role of angiogenic
kinases in tumor growth (37) led us to investigate an alternative
strategy by combining sunitinib, a small antiangiogenic molecule
with the targeting peptide [D-Lys6]-GnRH. Sunitinib has been
extensively used in the clinic for the treatment of solid tumors
with a known mechanism of action (32) and known off-target
cardiotoxicity (38). We hypothesized that conjugation of sunitinib to [D-Lys6]-GnRH would deliver the multikinase inhibitor to
the site of action, reducing off-target effects and the dose required
for efﬁcacy.
Because of the lack of "linkable" free groups of sunitinib, we
rationally designed and synthesized ﬁve analogues that maintained their efﬁcacy but could also be coupled to different ligands,
expanding their therapeutic potential to other cancer types.
Molecular docking analysis revealed that all SANs assumed a
bound conformation similar to sunitinib while remaining efﬁcacious at the low nanomolar scale. Evaluation of our data
combined with facile chemical synthesis singled-out SAN1 as the
lead compound for further development using an in vivo CRPC
xenograft animal model.
SAN1 treatment was well tolerated and proved efﬁcacious in
inhibiting tumor growth by reduced CD31 and Ki-67 cells in
treated animals, suggesting that inhibition of angiogenesis was at
least one mechanism by which SAN1 achieved its efﬁcacy.
Building on the efﬁcacy of SAN1, we investigated whether
linking of [D-Lys6]-GnRH to SAN1 would lead to an enhanced
delivery of the active molecule to the tumor site. SAN1GSC was
generated followed by comprehensive in vitro and in silico evaluation. SAN1GSC maintained its antiangiogenic and cytotoxic
properties with IC50 values similar to those of unconjugated
SAN1.
After dosing of SAN1GSC, the detectable levels of free circulating SAN1 in the blood were low, possibly a desirable feature
expected to minimize peripheral toxicities. SAN1GSC was well
tolerated and proved efﬁcacious in our CRPC xenograft model.
Importantly, measurements of SAN1 in tumor sample specimens
showed approximately four times higher levels of intracellular
SAN1 released from SAN1GSC than levels of SAN1 delivered
following SAN1 dosing. A deeper mechanistic insight of the
efﬁcacy observed with SAN1GSC was provided by the direct
inhibition of the RPS6KB1 enzyme, a molecule linked to prostate
cancer aggressiveness and metastasis (39, 40). Sunitinib has a
reported low nmol/L binding afﬁnity for RPS6KB1 (41) a putative
target for the development of new drugs (42). Our ﬁnding that in
vivo inhibition of RPS6KB1 was achieved only in SAN1GSCtreated mice was presumably due to the enhanced targeting of
the tumor microenvironment by the conjugate.
SAN1GSC contains the potent [D-Lys6]-GnRH agonist peptide,
and it is possible that it exerts an additional central effect through
the pituitary in the described dosing scheme, leading to the
lowering of gonadal hormone levels (31).
Considering that GnRH agonists are typically used for the
CRPC treatment in combination with other drugs (e.g., docetaxel,
abiraterone,), a dual pharmacologic approach based on a conjugate monotherapy resulting into intratumoral and circulating
testosterone ablation coupled with inhibition of angiogenesis
locally, might provide additional beneﬁt in the clinic. As it is not
clear how such an approach would alleviate the problem of
resistance to treatment that often develops through mechanisms
involving ligand-dependent or ligand-independent androgen
receptor signaling, future studies may be needed to address this

1190 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

hypothesis (40). Our ﬁnding that SAN1GSC inhibited RPS6KB1,
a molecule with an important role in CRPC and the upregulated
PI3K–mTOR–S6 pathway (40), is further encouraging in terms of
its clinical potential.
Importantly, SAN1GSC appeared to have a minimal cardiotoxic and hematotoxic effect in treated mice compared with
sunitinib and SAN1 in our dosing scheme. Elevations of blood
pressure that might contribute to cardiac dysfunction were not
detected following dosing of sunitinib and its analogues, verifying previously published reports (22). However, we did
observe a reduction in the percentage of FS in mice treated
with the various molecules. The reduction of the percentage
of FS in SAN1 and sunitinib was not detrimental enough to
cause a phenotypic cardiac alteration, but it was statistically
signiﬁcant compared with their corresponding baseline measurements, as opposed to SAN1GSC. In addition, SAN1GSC did
not affect WBC populations or other hematologic parameters
measured. Mild erythrocytosis was observed in the [D-Lys6]GnRH and SAN1GSC-treated mice, possibly linked to the
agonist effects of the [D-Lys6]-GnRH moiety and temporary
increase of testosterone levels (ﬂare effect), an effect that has
been reported with GnRH agonists in the clinic (43).
One limitation of the current study is the lack of SAN1GSC
evaluation in other clinically relevant models, where prostate
cancer is either orthotopically generated, or by using patientderived xenografts which reﬂect the heterogeneity within different cancer histotypes. These studies will assess the efﬁcacy of
SAN1GSC in the metastatic setting, where several small molecules often do fail despite initial success in the primary tumor.
In conclusion, we have generated a series of novel linkable
antiangiogenic compounds to treat various forms of cancer based
on the clinically successful drug sunitinib. We demonstrated for
the ﬁrst time a direct conjugation of a sunitinib analogue to a
peptide moiety generating a minimally cardiotoxic compound,
efﬁcacious at a lower dose than equimolar amounts of sunitinib
and able to achieve a 4-fold enhanced delivery/beneﬁt to the
tumor. The concept is certainly applicable to other solid tumor
types expressing the GnRH-R or even to other types of receptors by
altering the targeting peptide.
