Abstract
Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a high
incidence of lung cancer and a worse prognosis for clinical
treatment. A few molecules with antifibrosis properties have
been shown promoting cancer progression in clinical trials.
The objective of this study was to determine whether there is
a similar tendency in mice as in human beings and whether
these mice models may be used to find new therapeutic agents
with antifibrotic properties but not cancer-promoting properties. We used bleomycin to induce pulmonary fibrosis in
mice with or without naringenin treatment and measured the
immune-associated lymphocytes and their secreted cytokines
using flow cytometry and ELISA from lung tissue. Both passive
and spontaneous metastatic models in bleomycin-treated
C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were used to test the hypothesis
that mice with pulmonary fibrosis could have an increased
risk of lung cancer and associated cancer progression.
Here, we show that mice with lung fibrosis challenged using
tumors show an increased incidence of lung metastasis and
shorter life spans compared with the mice without lung
fibrosis. A fibrotic environment in the lung results in
increased abundance of transforming growth factor-B1 and
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and a decreased proportion of activated effector T cells. This grave immunosuppressive environment favors tumor localization and growth.
Naringenin significantly reduces lung metastases in mice
with pulmonary fibrosis and increases their survival by
improving the immunosuppressive environment through
down-regulating transforming growth factor-B1 and reducing
regulatory T cells. Naringenin could be an ideal therapeutic
agent in the treatment of both cancer and fibrosis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and lethal lung disease
typically characterized by abnormalities of alveolar structure
accompanied by myofibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix, with resulting lung scarring and
inhibition of gas exchange. It is frequently associated with collagen
diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, radiotherapy to the chest region,
and drugs, including anticancer agents (1–3).

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is currently believed to be an
epithelial-fibroblast disease in which endogenous or environmental
stimuli may disrupt the homeostasis of alveolar epithelial cells,
resulting in an abnormal repair process (4). Activated epithelial
cells are thought to release potent fibrogenic molecules and
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor a and transforming
growth factor h1 (TGF-h1), which in turn foster the transformation
of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and promote production of
extracellular matrix molecules. TGF-h1 has been widely implicated
in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis and,
through an intricate signaling cascade, promotes extracellular
matrix gene transcription (5).
TGF-h has sweeping inhibitory effects on the immune system,
negatively affecting many immune cell types and functions (6, 7).
TGF-h is both a tumor suppressor and tumor promoter depending
on the context and stage of tumor progression (8).
The emergence of disseminated metastases remains the major
cause of mortality, being responsible for 90% of all cancer deaths
(9, 10). Recent data show that organ microenvironment can
influence the growth, invasion, and response of metastases to
chemotherapy (11, 12). Understanding the biological basis of
cancer metastasis presents unprecedented possibilities for translating basic research to the clinical reality of cancer treatment. The
lung is one of the most easily metastasized organs, and its fibrosis
is often a consequence of exposure to environmental substances
and therapeutic agents (13). Clinical data strongly show an increase
in the risk of lung cancer in patients with IPF (14–17). It has been
proposed that fibrosis may have a role in carcinogenesis through
the occurrence of atypical or dysplastic epithelial changes in
pulmonary fibrosis, which progress to invasive malignancy (18, 19).
However, the relevance of pulmonary fibrosis to the ability of
tumor cells to invade and metastasize is unclear. TGF-h1/Smads
regulates processes such as the evasion of immune surveillance and
promotion of extracellular matrix gene transcription, leading to
speculation that TGF-h1/Smads might mediate patients with IPF
having a high incidence of lung cancer and those patients with
pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer having a worse prognosis for
clinical treatment (20, 21).
Naringenin, a natural predominant flavanone, has a wide range of
pharmacologic activities. In a previous in vitro study, we showed that
naringenin selectively inhibited the transcription of Smad3, and in
turn reduced the accumulation of EMC, including collagen Ia1,
fibronectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (22). On the basis
of its unanticipated ability to exhibit antifibrogenic activity, we have
investigated whether naringenin has the effects on lung metastasis in
a pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. We hypothesize that naringenin
might improve the microenvironment of fibrotic lung in mice
toward that of normal lung conditions and provide associated
suppression of lung metastasis. Significantly, bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis promoted lung metastasis and progression of
tumors in in vivo metastatic models. More importantly, naringenin

markedly ameliorates the microenvironment of bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis and suppresses lung metastasis via directly
down-regulating TGF-h1 in the lungs of mice.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and mice. Lewis lung carcinoma and 4T1 mammary cancer
cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured (37jC incubator
with 5% CO2) in DMEM or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(100 U/mL). All cells culture regents were purchased from Invitrogen.
The lung fibrosis and tumor models were implemented in female C57BL/
6 and BALB/c mice weighing 18 to 22 grams ( from the Institute of
Biophysics). All protocols and studies involving animals conducted in
accordance with NIH and Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Institution of Biophysics guidelines.
Lung fibrosis model. Mice were distributed at random to the tested
groups and were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital
(60 mg/kg) before intratracheal instillation of either bleomycin (purchased
from Nippon Kayaku) or saline. Either next day or day 14 after bleomycin
instillation, a daily dose of 100 mg/kg naringenin (the dose with maximum
effects based on dose-response experiments; purchased from Shanxi Huike
Botanical Development Co.) suspended in 0.5% CMC-Na or only 0.5% CMCNa 200 AL per mouse was administered orally for 3 or 4 wk. Mice were killed
by i.p. injection of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital on the days
indicated after bleomycin treatment, and their lungs were then appropriately processed for bronchoalveolar lavage and biochemical and histopath-

ologic studies. For collagen assay, total lung collagen was estimated using
sircol collagen assay kits (Biocolor Ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Malondialdehyde equivalent in lungs was estimated from the
total amount of thiobarbituric acid reacting products (according to the
manufacturers’ instructions).
Lung processing for cytokines. Nonlavaged whole lungs were excised
and homogenized on ice in 2 mL of cold PBS. After centrifugation at 4jC
(10,000 rpm, 15 min), supernatants were divided into several aliquots and
stored at 70jC for determination of cytokines. Concentrations of IFN-g,
interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and TGF-h1 were quantified using ELISA kits (R&D
Systems).
Isolation of lymphocytes. Lungs were removed, minced, and incubated
at 37jC for 90 min in HBSS containing 1 mg/mL collagenase D and 0.02 mg/
mL DNase I (Sigma). After enzyme treatment, lung tissue was gently passed
through a cell strainer (BD Bioscience), and then washed twice in HBSS.
Cells were resuspended in 35% Percoll (GE Healthcare) in PBS, layered over
70% Percoll, and spun at 2,500 rpm for 20 min. Lymphocytes collected from
the interface were used for subsequent flow cytometry analysis.
Flow cytometry. FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 (GK1.5), Percp-cy5.5–
conjugated anti-CD8 (53-6.7), APC-conjugated anti-CD25 (PC-61.5), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD44 (IM7), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD62L
(MEL-14), and purified anti-mouse CD16/32 (93) were purchased from
eBioscience for surface staining. For intracellular cytokine staining, Percoll
purified cells were stimulated with 25 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13acetate (Sigma) and 500 ng/mL Ionomycin (Sigma) for 5 h, and then
Brefeldin A Solution (eBioscience) was added for the final 3 h of culture.
After surface stained with a specific antibody, the cells fixed and
permeabilized using a fixation and permeabilization kit (eBioscience), and

finally stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti–IFN-g (XMG1.2), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti–IL-4 (11B11), and APC-conjugated anti–IL-2
(JES6-5H4). The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScalibur).
For T-reg cell analysis, intracellular Foxp3 staining was performed by using
a Mouse Regulatory T cell Staining Kit (eBioscience) according to the
manufacturer’s directions.
Histopathologic evaluation. Five animals from each group were
randomly chosen for histopathologic evaluation of their right lungs at
tested times. Lungs were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 h and processed
in paraffin. Lung sections were stained with H&E for inflammatory injury
and modified Masson’s trichrome stains for fibrotic change. The severity of
pulmonary fibrosis was semiquantitated using the Ashcroft score.
Tumor metastasis models. 4T1 cells (1  105 cells per mouse) for
BALB/c mice or Lewis lung carcinoma cells (2  105 cells per mouse) for
C57BL/6 mice were injected i.v. through the tail vein for tumor passive
metastasis or injected s.c. for tumor spontaneous metastasis on the
appropriate day after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Pulmonary
metastasis was evaluated by lung weight on day 28 or 35 after injection of
tumor cells for passive metastasis and spontaneous metastasis, respectively.
Survival of BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 tumors was evaluated within either
70 or 120 d as indicated.
Tumor latency and localization. For tumor latency study, a suspension
of lung cells was obtained from normal lung or fibrotic lung 21 d after
bleomycin treatment by mincing and enzymatic digestion with collagenase
type III (10 mg per lung) for 80 min at 37jC as described above and was
filtered through 70-Am filters. Thirty animals were randomly divided into
3 groups, with 10 animals in each group. A 1:1 mixture of normal lung cells
or fibrotic lung cells with 4T1 cells was coinjected s.c. (1  105 cells per
mouse) into the right flank. Tumor latency was indicated by the presence of
a palpable mass at the site of injection. Tumor sizes were measured twice
weekly with calipers and calculated as the length  width2/2. Tumors were
excised and weighed 28 d after injection of 4T1 cells. For tumor localization
study, 4T1 cells labeled with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl
ester (CFSE) were injected i.v. on day 21 after bleomycin treatment. Mice
were killed and the lungs were removed at 3 h and 24 h after injection.
CFSE-labeling 4T1 cells in the lung tissue were determined by a two-photo
excitation microscope. Flow cytometry was used for quantification of CFSElabeling 4T1 cells.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was analyzed using SPSS,
version 10.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc). Student’s t test analysis was used to

determine P values when comparing two groups. When comparing three or
more groups, ANOVA was performed with a post hoc Bonferroni test to
determine which two groups showed significant differences; P value of <0.05
was considered significant.

Results
Naringenin attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary
fibrosis. To determine whether naringenin has an effect on
bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, we performed
bleomycin treatment on syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and allogeneic
BALB/c mice. Results were similar to previous studies (23), C57BL/
6 mice were highly sensitive to bleomycin-induced pulmonary
fibrosis (50 Ag per mouse), whereas BALB/c mice were relatively
resistant to bleomycin (100 Ag per mouse). Twenty-one and thirtyfives days after administration of bleomycin, both C57BL/6 mice
and BALB/c mice showed overt lung fibrosis as shown by H&E and
Masson trichrome staining, collagen content, and mlondialdehyde
content (Fig. 1A–D). Histologic changes at day 21 and 35 were
shown in Fig. 1A. Lung tissue sections in both kinds of mice treated
by bleomycin without naringenin showed extensive patchy areas of
regional interstitial fibrosis with marked disruption of the alveolar
unit, increased thickening of the interalveolar septa, and inflammation. Mean fibrosis scores were significantly increased in
bleomycin-treated mice compared with untreated mice (Fig. 1B).
However, in the lung tissues of mice that had been treated with
naringenin for 3 weeks on next day or on day 14 after bleomycin
instillation (the mice already developed fibrosis), the structural
integrity of the lung was less severely affected, with less evidence
of fibrotic obliteration, destruction of alveolar units, and
inflammation cell infiltration. The mean fibrosis score was
significantly reduced in mice received naringenin compared with
mice unreceived naringenin (Fig. 1B). Collagen content (an index
of fibrosis) increased in the lungs in bleomycin-treated mice,
whereas mice received naringenin had markedly reduced collagen
content close to normally basal levels (Fig. 1C). Mlondialdehyde
content (a marker of lipid peroxidation) was markedly elevated in

Figure 3. Naringenin suppresses lung metastasis in mice with pulmonary fibrosis and increases survival of mice with pulmonary fibrosis and lung metastasis.
Naringenin inhibited lung metastasis in passive metastatic model (A) and in spontaneous metastatic model (B ). Lewis lung carcinoma cells and 4T1 cells were injected
into mice 7 d (passive model) and next day (spontaneous model) after bleomycin treatment, respectively. After tumor cell injection, mice received naringenin for
4 wk and tumor-bearing lungs were examined on day 28 (passive model) and on day 35 (spontaneous model), photographed (left ), and weighed (right ). Columns ,

the lungs in bleomycin-treated mice, whereas mice received
naringenin showed a significantly reduced production of mlondialdehyde (Fig. 1D ). Normal BALB/c mice treated with
naringenin had no difference in lung histologic change, collagen
content, and mlondialdehyde content compared with untreated
mice (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Mice with pulmonary fibrosis show increases in lung
metastatic tumors. We hypothesized that mice with pulmonary
fibrosis could have an increased risk of lung cancer and associated
cancer progression, which might have a similar tendency in mice to
human beings. To test this hypothesis, 5  104 4T1 cells were
injected i.v. into BALB/c mice. Lung metastatic progression was
evaluated by histologic examination and survival was observed by
mice death. All dead mice had an extensive tumor burden in the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

lungs, but obvious metastasis was not observed in other organs
including lymph nodes, indicating that the mice died of lung
metastasis (data not shown). At day 120, 12 mice injected with
tumor cells 7 days after bleomycin treatment, displayed a dramatic
decrease in survival by 25% (3 of 12). In contrast, 12 mice that did
not receive bleomycin treatment had a large survival by 66.7% (8 of
12; P < 0.01), as shown in Fig. 2A. To assess the importance of the
pulmonary fibrosis microenvironment as a mediator of lung tumor
progression, fibrotic lung cells or normal lung cells were injected
s.c. with 4T1 cells in BALB/c mice. Mice coinjected with tumor cells
and fibrotic lung cells had a shorter mean tumor latency of 5.8 F
0.8 days compared with 8.3 F 1.2 days for mice coinjected with
tumor cells and normal lung cells. Weights of tumors on day 28
from mice coinjected with fibrotic lung cells were f2-fold greater

(mean, 3.03 F 0.31 grams versus 1.62 F 0.28 grams) than those
from mice coinjected with normal lung cells and 4T1 injection
alone, which were good consistent with tumor growth curves (Fig.
2B). Our results provide evidence that mice with pulmonary
fibrosis could have an increased risk of lung cancer and associated
cancer progression. One possible explanation is that pulmonary
fibrosis promotes the colonization of tumor cells in the lung. To
prove lung metastasis events after i.v. injection of CFSE-labeling
4T1 cells in the bleomycin-treated mice, the proportion of 4T1 cells
to total lung cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Within 3 hours
of entering the circulation, there was no significant difference in
the number of 4T1 cells that fluoresced between fibrotic lung and
normal lung. However, 24 hours after 4T1 cell injection,
fluorescence intensity derived from 4T1 cells in fibrotic lung was
8-fold higher than that in normal lung (Fig. 2C), indicating that
pulmonary fibrosis promotes the colonization of tumor cells in the
lung. Furthermore, we examined the effects of pulmonary fibrosis
induced with bleomycin in early stages (7 days, an inflammatory
response) and late stages (21 days, fibrotic changes) on lung
metastasis. At day 28 after injection of tumor cells, tumor weights
in late fibrotic lung were significantly increased compared with
those in early fibrotic lung (Fig. 2D). Tumor weights in both early
and late fibrotic lung were increased compared with in normal
lung.
Naringenin increases survival. As naringenin has shown an
inhibitory effect on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, we
investigated whether naringenin might also decrease lung metastasis and increase survival in mice with pulmonary fibrosis. We used
both passive and spontaneous metastatic models in bleomycin-

treated C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice to assess the efficacy of
naringenin. In passive models, mice injected i.v. with tumor
cells 7 days after bleomycin treatment, the inhibitory effect of
naringenin on metastasis was reflected in a statistically significant
reduction in tumor weight in the fibrotic lung at day 28 compared
with untreated mice (Fig. 3A). In spontaneous models, treatment
with naringenin had similar results to the passive model. Naringenin
also showed a statistically significant reduction in tumor weight in
fibrotic lung (Fig. 3B) and in the normal lung (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) at day 35 compared with untreated mice. Next, we tested the
effect of lung metastasis on survival in mice with pulmonary fibrosis
and whether naringenin led to an extension of life span in these
mice. Mice injected i.v. with 4T1 cells 7 days after bleomycin
treatment had a shorter median life span of 38 F 9 days compared
with 60 F 9 days for mice without bleomycin treatment, and 55 F
12 days for bleomycin-treated mice received naringenin (Fig. 3C).
The life span of in the bleomycin-treated mice received naringenin
was significantly longer than the mice unreceived naringenin.
Normal mice challenged with tumor cells and treated with
naringenin also had a longer life span than those untreated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S2C and B).
Naringenin modulates bleomycin-induced immunosuppression. Cancer cells and fibrotic lung myofibroblasts evade immune
surveillance, thus allowing their uninterrupted growth and
accumulation (24, 25). We investigated whether naringenin might
regulate the immune system to increase its immune surveillance
ability. We found that the levels of TGF-h1 in the lung tissue from
both bleomycin-treated C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice increased
f10- and 6-fold, respectively, compared with untreated mice

(Fig. 4A). This is in good agreement with previous observations
(26, 27). In contrast, the TGF-h1 content in the fibrotic lung from
bleomycin-treated mice received naringenin decreased significantly
to that was slightly lower than in normal lung (Fig. 4A).
We investigated whether naringenin might increase levels of
type 1 cytokines and decrease type 2 cytokines to contribute its
antipulmonary fibrosis and antilung metastasis activities. These
cytokines are related to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (28).
IFN-g content decreased by f2-fold in both kinds of mice
compared with untreated mice (Fig. 4B). However, naringenin
increased the level of IFN-g in the bleomycin-induced fibrotic
lung tissue in mice (Fig. 4B). IL-2 content in bleomycin-induced
fibrotic lung tissues was much lower than in normal lung tissues,
whereas naringenin gave rise to a significant increase in the
content of IL-2 in these mice (Fig. 4C). However, IL-4 content in
bleomycin-induced fibrotic lung tissues was significantly higher
than in normal lung tissues, whereas bleomycin-treated mice
received naringenin had a lower IL-4 concentration compared
with mice unreceived naringenin (Fig. 4D). Normal mice received
naringenin had an insignificant change of the levels of TGF-h,
IFN-g, IL-2, and IL-4 in lung tissues compared with unreceived
mice (Fig. 4).

To determine whether naringenin enhanced CD8+ and CD4+
T cell activation, we assessed expression of various cell surface
receptors and activation markers. We observed that naringenin
significantly increased the proportion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells
expressing the activation marker CD44 in fibrotic lung in the
bleomycin-treated mice (Fig. 5A), and decreased the proportion of
CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing CD62L, a naive T-cell marker that
is down-regulated upon T-cell activation, compared with bleomycin-treated mice that unreceived naringenin treatment (Fig. 5B).
To investigate whether naringenin treatment could increase the
proportion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that secrete IFN-g and IL-2 in
bleomycin-induced fibrotic lung, we analyzed the expression of
various cell surface receptors and intracellular proteins and
confirmed that naringenin increases expression of IFN-g and IL-2
to varying degrees (Fig. 5C and D). The number of CD8+ and CD4+
T cells expressing IFN-g and IL-2 also increased, corresponding to
high levels of secreted IFN-g and IL-2 compared with the
bleomycin-treated mice unreceived naringenin treatment.
Naringenin reduces bleomycin-induced Foxp3 expression in
CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells. The increased prevalence of T-reg
cells in cancer patients inhibits an efficient antitumor cytotoxic
response (29, 30). We wondered whether the antifibrotic and

marker expression in the lungs from bleomycin-treated mice that
unreceived naringenin and low levels of Foxp3 marker expression
in the lungs in bleomycin-treated mice received naringenin
(Fig. 6C). We also observed that naringenin had no effect on the
expression of Foxp3 in normal lung (data no shown). These data
show that naringenin ameliorates the pulmonary immunosuppresive-microenvironment induced by bleomycin in mice and thus, in
turn, alleviates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, decreases
lung metastasis, and increases survival in mice with pulmonary
fibrosis.

Discussion

Figure 6. Naringenin reduces bleomycin-induced Foxp3 expression in
CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. Mice received naringenin for 3 wk after
bleomycin instillation and were killed. T cells were collected from lungs and
stained for the surface receptors CD4 and CD25, followed by intracellular Foxp3
staining using a mouse regulatory T-cell staining kit. A, Nar decreased the
positive distribution of Foxp3+ and CD25+ in total CD4+ T cells. The percentage

antitumor effects of naringenin may involve modulation of these
T-reg cells. T lymphocytes from the lungs of bleomycin-treated
mice were analyzed by three-color-staining flow cytometry for the
presence of CD4, CD25, and Foxp3 markers. The percentage of
CD4+ cells expressing CD25 and Foxp3 markers in fibrotic lung
from bleomycin-treated mice was significantly increased compared
with normal lung, whereas that in the mice received naringenin
was markedly reduced to slightly less than in normal lung (Fig. 6A
and B). These results corresponded with high levels of Foxp3

Recently, one of the largest cohort studies of IPF, involving 1,064
patients, showed that the incidence of lung cancer increased
markedly in patients with IPF compared with the general
population and that this effect is independent of smoking status
(17). Feghali-Bostwick and colleagues (31) showed that the number
of activated CD4+ T cells and the proportions of CD4+ T cells
producing TGF-h, IL-4, and IL-10 are significantly increased and
the proportions of CD4+ T cells producing IL-2, and IFN-g are
significantly reduced in IPF patients compared with normal
subjects.
We observed that in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
model, lung fibrosis scores, collagen content, and the concentrations of TGF-h1 and IL-4 were strikingly increased, and the
contents of IL-2 and IFN-g were markedly decreased compared
with normal lungs. In these models, we also found that bleomycintreated mice challenged with tumor cells showed a marked
increase in tumor weight in the lung and a higher mortality rate
due to lung metastasis compared with bleomycin-untreated mice.
Our findings are in good agreement with clinical observations. We
proposed that the pulmonary microenvironment and immune
system have been altered in bleomycin-treated mice, facilitating
metastatic progression in lungs. Tumor cells readily localized in
fibrotic lungs, and grew faster than in normal lungs as measured by
fluorescence intensity of CFSE-labeled tumor cells and lung tumor
burden (Fig. 2C). Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis protected
tumor cells from immune surveillance by secreting high levels of
TGF-h1 that increased the number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-reg
cells, and decreased the number of effector T cells and inhibited
their activation in tumor-bearing mice (Figs. 2A, 5, and 6). The
balance of effector cells including CD8+ CTL, IFN-g producing
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages versus
T-reg cells can be influenced by the tissue and environment where
the immune response is generated. CD4+ CD25+ T-reg cell
proliferation is induced in bleomycin-induced fibrotic lungs by
secretion of large amounts of TGF-h1 (32, 33). Moreover, TGF-h is a
costimulator of Foxp3 expression, which promotes the differentiation of CD4+ CD25+ T-reg cells from peripheral CD4+ CD25
progeny (34). T-reg cells play a critical role in maintaining tolerance
to self-antigen and in preventing antoimmunity (35). Inducible
T-reg cells secreting TGF-h suppress tumor-specific CD8+ cell
cytotoxicity through TGF-h signals in vivo (36). Thus, bleomycininduced fibrotic lung has a stronger immunosuppressive environment that favors tumor growth than normal lung. Increasing
evidence shows that CD4+ CD25+ T-reg cells may play a pivotal role
in progression of a number of cancers (37, 38).
IPF is the most common type and afflicts >5 million patients
worldwide, with a median survival of 3 to 5 years after diagnosis,
and yet there is no effective treatment (39). A few growth factors

and hormones have been used to reduce the proportion of
activated fibroblasts in tissue fibrosis (40, 41). However, these
molecules with antifibrotic properties also promote cancer
progression (42, 43).
In this study, we found that naringenin markedly reduced the
levels of TGF-h1 both in lung tissues and blood in bleomycintreated mice with and without tumors. Naringenin not only
increases the proportion of T cells that can respond to the tumor
and fibrosis but also restores the activities of the CTL cytotoxic
program and IFN-g secretion for tumor clearance and fibrosis
abrogation. Thus, one possible mechanism is that naringenin
modulates CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-reg cells through inhibition of
TGF-h1. However, normal mice received naringenin at the same
dosage did not show any significant changes in collagen and
cytokines in their lungs (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 4).
In summary, the role of tissue fibrosis in the initiation,
progression, and metastasis of cancer remains unclear and needs
further study. Ideal therapeutic molecules will be ones that are able

to remove cancer-promoting properties but retain antifibrotic
ones. Thus, naringenin should be an ideal therapeutic agent
both for cancer therapy and fibrosis treatment because it
has antifibrotic properties without having cancer-promoting
properties.
