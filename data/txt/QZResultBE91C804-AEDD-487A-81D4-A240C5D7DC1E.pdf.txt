BACKGROUND. The efficacy of palliative chemotherapy was investigated in a large
group of patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) treated on routine
palliative protocols.
METHODS. Patients with STS who had first-line chemotherapy for advanced and/
or metastatic disease between 1991 and 2005 were identified from the Royal
Marsden Hospital’s sarcoma database. Patients with Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and gastrointestinal stromal

metastatic disease. The most common histologic subtypes were leiomyosarcoma
(35%) synovial sarcoma (13%), liposarcoma (10%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (10%). In all, 61% received single-agent chemotherapy, usually doxorubicin. An objective response was reported in 33% of patients (53% in those with
synovial sarcoma); 22% had stable disease and 45% derived ‘clinical benefit’
(objective responses 1 stable disease for 6 months). Median duration of
response was 9 months and median posttreatment overall survival (OS) was
12 months. In multivariate analysis, age <40 years, liposarcoma, and synovial histology were found to be positive, and bone involvement to be negative, independent prognostic factors. Patients treated with combination chemotherapy
experienced longer OS than those treated with a single agent.

CONCLUSIONS. Palliative chemotherapy may be beneficial in approximately half
of patients with advanced STS. Synovial sarcoma and liposarcoma subtypes have
a better prognosis. However, the overall poor outcome of these patients indicates

oft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are malignant tumors of connective
tissue, accounting for approximately 1% of all human cancers.1
They exhibit a wide range of clinical behavior depending on the histologic subtype, tumor site, grade, and site of disease. In particular,
different histologic subtypes demonstrate various responsiveness to
systemic therapy as defined by objective remission and subsequent
survival. Systemic chemotherapy given with palliative intent is the
only available treatment option for many patients with advanced
STS, yet the results are generally unsatisfactory.2 Favorable prognostic factors for response to chemotherapy have been variously
reported as young age, good performance status (PS), absence of
liver metastases, and liposarcoma or synovial histology.3 Surgery

offers the only reliable chance of cure, but locally
advanced unresectable and metastatic disease are
considered generally incurable, with few patients
experiencing long-term survival.4 Single-agent doxorubicin is the most widely accepted treatment option
for these tumors.5 Whereas combination chemotherapy has been reported to produce higher tumor
response rates, mainly in single-center studies of
selected patients, randomized trials have failed to
detect a survival benefit for chemotherapy combinations6–8 or intensified chemotherapy regimens.9,10
We conducted this retrospective study with the
aim of investigating the role of routine palliative
chemotherapy in an unselected cohort of patients
with advanced STS treated at a single institution, and
to identify the prognostic factors that will predict
which patients are most likely to derive benefit from
this treatment.

included in the analysis if they subsequently received
chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease.
The clinical outcome for each patient was recorded
as of August 2005. Last follow-up visit was recorded
as alive with disease or alive with no evidence of disease.
Response to chemotherapy was analyzed as a binary variable: responders were those who were
reported as having achieved a complete or partial
response; all other patients were classified as nonresponders. Patients who achieved stable disease for
6 months or more and an improvement of symptoms
were considered as having derived clinical benefit
from chemotherapy. Patients were usually re-imaged
after every 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy according
to unit policy. Response to chemotherapy was
recorded by retrospective reviewing of radiology
reports (most recent reports used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST], and older
reports used the WHO criteria).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Before the study, local research ethics committee approval was obtained. The Royal Marsden Hospital’s
prospective sarcoma database was used to identify
patients treated for advanced STS. The patient population included patients registered between 1991 and
2005. Data regarding each patient were gathered retrospectively from patients’ clinical notes and the
Royal Marsden Hospital’s electronic patient record.
Patients’ general practitioners were contacted where
necessary to obtain follow-up information. In all
cases histology was reviewed by a specialist soft tissue pathologist on referral to the Royal Marsden
Hospital. Patients with the chemosensitive subtypes
Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, as well as those with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), were excluded
from the study. In the pre-GIST era, however, where
these cases were mainly termed gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas, cases with questionable histology
were not excluded, as histology review was not feasible. Only patients who received chemotherapy in our
institution were included in the analysis.
Date of histologic confirmation of diagnosis and
patient’s age at the time of diagnosis were recorded.
Advanced disease was defined as primary tumor or
local recurrence not amenable to complete surgical
resection, or the presence of metastatic disease.
Additional information included: date of diagnosis
and site of metastases or local recurrence; chemotherapy agents used, number of courses administered, and response to treatment; treatment with
palliative radiotherapy; and metastasectomy. Patients
who received adjuvant chemotherapy were only

Statistical Methods
The effect of age, histologic subtype, presence of
symptoms, and site of metastatic disease on
response to chemotherapy was investigated in a univariate analysis by means of the v2 test, Fisher exact
test, and the Mann-Whitney test. The independent
significance of variables was assessed by means of a
logistic regression analysis using a step-up procedure. Histologic subtype was treated as a categorical
variable and a test for heterogeneity was used. Contrasts were used to select the significant subtypes. A
test for trend was used to assess the significance of
the ordered categorical variables (age group and
extent of disease 5 locally advanced/single organ
metastasis/multiple organ metastases).
Overall survival (OS) was measured from the
start of chemotherapy for advanced disease until
death from any cause or last follow-up. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the time from the start
of chemotherapy until radiologic documentation of
disease progression or, in the absence of radiology,
until death from disease. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Age, histology, symptoms, and the site of disease
were investigated as potential prognostic factors for
OS by means of a univariate log-rank analysis. The
independent significance of variables was assessed in
a multivariate Cox regression analyses. A step-up
procedure was used and variables were entered at
the 5% level of significance. Hazard ratios (HRs) were
calculated together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

astatic disease. Lung was the most common site of
metastatic disease (56%), followed by soft tissue
(35%), liver (10%), and bone (9%). The majority of
patients (70%) had single-organ metastatic involvement. The demographic details are shown in Table 1.

Patient Characteristics
Between January 1991 and December 2005, 687 new
patients with advanced STS were diagnosed and treated with chemotherapy. The patient population
included patients who were referred to the Royal
Marsden Hospital at initial diagnosis, and those who
were referred at the point of development of
advanced disease. From the total population of
patients, 199 who had been treated elsewhere with
chemotherapy for metastatic disease were excluded
from analysis. A total of 488 patients (242 males and
246 females, median age of 49 years) who received
first-line chemotherapy for advanced STS in our
institution were considered eligible for analysis. Tumor resection with or without adjuvant radical radiotherapy was the standard treatment modality for
primary tumors, the majority of which were located
in the lower limbs. The most prevalent histologic
subtype was leiomyosarcoma (35%), followed by synovial sarcoma (13%), liposarcoma (10%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (10%). At the start of
palliative chemotherapy, 81 patients (17%) had
locally advanced disease and the remainder had met-

Response to Chemotherapy
The majority of patients (84%) were treated with
standard palliative chemotherapy protocols. In all,
299 patients received single-agent (61%) and 189
(39%) combination chemotherapy. Ten patients who
were treated with endocrine therapy were included
in the single-agent population. Doxorubicin was the
most common single agent used (75%), followed by
ifosfamide (13%) and other cytotoxic agents (12%).
With regard to combination chemotherapy, 80% of
patients were treated with doxorubicin and ifosfamide and 20% had other combination regimens. A
total of 1762 chemotherapy cycles were administered
(median number per patient 5 4; range, 1–8) (see
Table 2).
An objective response was defined as a complete
or partial response, the duration being measured
from the first radiologic documentation of the
response. An objective response was reported in
161 patients (33%), which included 3% of patients
who achieved a complete response, and 30% who
achieved a partial response. In all, 105 patients (22%)

achieved stable disease and 222 patients (45%) progressed while on treatment. The median time to progression was 3 months for all patients, whereas the
duration of response for patients who responded to
chemotherapy was 9 months (range, 4–175) (Table
2). The median duration of stable disease for those
patients for whom this was the best response was
6 months (range, 2 months to 70 months). Stable disease lasting for 6 months was observed in 12% of
patients. These patients have been included with
those having achieved an objective response to give
an overall number deriving clinical benefit from
treatment of 45%.
The results of the univariate analysis of factors
predictive of objective response demonstrated young
age (<40 years) and synovial histology to be highly
predictive for response to chemotherapy (48% and
52%, respectively). A lower response rate for malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors was of borderline significance (18%; P 5 .08). After adjusting for age and
histology, combination chemotherapy achieved a better response rate compared with single-agent chemotherapy (47% vs 25%; P < .001).

Survival Analysis
At the time of analysis 99 patients (20%) were alive.
The median postchemotherapy OS was 12 months
(95% CI, 9–13 months) (Fig. 1). The median progression-free survival was 3 months, and the median duration of response was 9 months. In all, 23% of
patients were alive at 2 years and 9% were alive at 5
years from the beginning of chemotherapy.
Univariate analysis of factors predictive of survival after commencement of chemotherapy for
advanced disease is shown in Table 3. Patients aged
younger than 40 years were more likely to survive
longer compared with older patients (P 5 .002). Also,
patients with synovial sarcoma and liposarcoma had

superior survival compared with other histologic subtypes (P < .001). Conversely, the presence of bone
metastases was found to be an adverse prognostic
factor (P 5 .004). A nonsignificant trend for superior
survival was found for patients who had locally
advanced disease (15 months) compared with those
who had metastatic disease either in a single organ
(13 months) or in multiple sites (9 months) (P 5 .06).
Patients who had combination chemotherapy lived
longer compared with those who were treated with
single-agent chemotherapy (16 vs 11 months,

overall survival, synovial sarcoma and liposarcoma
histologic subtypes were found to be independent

DISCUSSION
Adult STS, despite their heterogeneity and acknowledged clinical, pathologic, and molecular differences,
are generally treated in a similar fashion. Exceptions
to this include GISTs, Ewing family tumors, and
other small round cell tumors. For patients with
localized disease, optimal treatment consists of surgical resection followed by radical postoperative radiotherapy for those with intermediate and high-grade
tumors, or close resection margins. However, despite
some improvement in local control rates over the
past decades, many patients subsequently recur with
locally advanced or metastatic disease. Systemic
chemotherapy is considered the only therapeutic
option for patients presenting with widely metastatic
disease or with locally advanced disease not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy.11 For the majority of
these patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy should be
regarded as palliative, although in a small subset of
patients long-term survival may be achieved.12
In our cohort of 488 patients, the median survival from the start of chemotherapy was 12 months.
This is in accordance with most published studies,
which have demonstrated median survival ranging

between 7 and 12 months.3,13 It has been suggested
that there is a potential advantage for combination
chemotherapy in terms of superior response rates
and overall survival. However, no phase 3 studies
have demonstrated a progression-free or survival
benefit of combination chemotherapy compared
with single-agent doxorubicin, although higher
response rates were documented with some combinations.6,8 Furthermore, it is acknowledged that intensive combination chemotherapy regimens are
associated with greater toxicity.9,14
In this retrospective study, as per our unit policy,
patients receiving doxorubicin and ifosfamide combination chemotherapy were generally selected on the
basis of a younger age and good PS, frequently with
the aim of downstaging disease to render it resectable. Given that age and PS have a major impact on
the effect of chemotherapy in sarcoma this is a likely
cause of bias in favor of combination therapy. However, combination chemotherapy produced a higher
response rate even after adjusting for age and histology. Nevertheless, PS was not was not accurately
documented in a fair number of cases and, thus, limited any statistical analysis. We therefore speculate
that PS and the multiple regimens included in the
combination treatment group might have led to the
superior clinical outcome observed in this group of
patients.
The use of combination chemotherapy in locally
advanced or metastatic disease to improve survival
remains unproven and needs to be confirmed in
large phase 3 randomized trials. Indeed, the ongoing
phase 3 EORTC 62,012 study, comparing single-agent
doxorubicin with a GCSF-supported dose-intense
combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, is
designed to answer the question of whether combination chemotherapy results in improved survival of

1590

patients with advanced STS. For the majority of
patients receiving chemotherapy for palliation of
symptoms, this can often be achieved with less intensive, and hence less toxic, schedules.
In this analysis we also found a trend for better
OS in patients with locally advanced disease or metastases in a single organ compared with those who
had multiple organ involvement. Chemotherapy may
contribute to cure in these patients if tumor shrinkage facilitates subsequent optimal local treatment.12
In such cases it is logical to use chemotherapeutic
regimens that yield the highest response rates
achievable. Nevertheless, only 10 patients from our
cohort went on to have their residual disease treated
with radiotherapy and/or surgery, suggesting that
careful selection of patients for such ‘neoadjuvant’
combination chemotherapy is essential.
Objective responses were observed in about a
third of patients in our cohort. These findings are in
agreement with previously published studies. However, if we also include those patients who had radiologically stable disease lasting for at least 6 months,
45% of patients derived clinical benefit from chemotherapy.
Several studies have examined whether specific
factors influence outcome of chemotherapy in adult
patients with STS. The largest report was an analysis
of 2185 patients participating in EORTC studies.3
On multivariate analysis, absence of liver metastases, young age, and high histopathologic grade
were identified as favorable factors for response to
chemotherapy. In the same cohort, good performance status, young age, no liver involvement, a low
histopathologic grade, and a long time period
between primary diagnosis and initiation of chemotherapy were independently associated with a better
OS. It must be noted that all patients in the EORTC
analysis were included because of their eligibility for
clinical trials, including good PS. Our patients, on
the other hand, were treated on the basis of clinical
need, and may not be directly comparable. Complete
data on PS in our dataset are lacking. In our analysis,
young age was also found to favor response to chemotherapy and prognosis of patients with advanced
STS. The presence of bone metastases was found to
be an independent adverse prognostic factor. In the
EORTC study the presence of bone metastases was
also an adverse prognostic factor on univariate,
although not on multivariate, analysis. A possible explanation for the adverse impact of skeletal metastases could be that the development of bone
metastases is often a relatively late feature of the natural history of the disease. A further adverse prognostic factor was the presence of liver metastases. It

is likely that in the era before the accurate diagnosis
of GIST, many patients with GIST were treated on
STS chemotherapy trial protocols. This would have
adversely influenced the results, given the chemoinsensitivity of GIST. However, the presence of liver
disease remained an independent adverse prognostic
factor in the EORTC analysis, even after removing all
cases of GIST.3
The EORTC group also analyzed the characteristics of long-term survivors after initial systemic treatment of advanced STS in the same cohort of patients
analyzed for the identification of prognostic factors
associated with response and OS.12 Survival for more
than 5 years was observed in 66 of 1888 patients
(8%). On multivariate analysis, good PS, female sex,
low tumor grade, and complete response after firstline treatment were identified as predictive of superior 5-year survival. Consistent with these findings,
9% of cases in our cohort survived for more than
5 years. However, because of the small number of
cases a separate statistical analysis is not feasible.
We identified liposarcoma histology to be a
favorable prognostic factor for survival, although
not for response to chemotherapy. In contrast, the
EORTC cohort discussed previously did not find liposarcoma to be predictive of survival, although it was
a favorable prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy. This may be explained by the finding that in
our cohort the majority of liposarcoma patients who
received chemotherapy were the myxoid subtype,
which has been recently shown to display a superior
response to chemotherapy as compared with other
liposarcoma subtypes.15
Synovial sarcoma histology has also been found
to be an independent favorable prognostic factor for
survival and predictive of response to chemotherapy.16 More than half of the patients with synovial
sarcoma in our cohort had an objective response to
palliative chemotherapy. Hence, synovial sarcoma
could be considered as the most chemosensitive sarcoma subtype after Ewing family tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas. The higher response rate achieved
with chemotherapy might contribute to the more
favorable outcome and the better survival of patients
with these tumors.
We postulate that combination chemotherapy
might benefit younger patients with more chemosensitive tumor types so as to achieve the maximum
response and possibly improved survival. In addition,
combination chemotherapy could be considered the
standard option for downstaging patients to render
disease resectable, an approach that is important
and potentially curative for a small subgroup of
patients.12,17

Palliative Chemotherapy in Advanced STS/Karavasilis et al.

We conclude that palliative chemotherapy in
advanced STS should be regarded as a standard
treatment option in the management of these aggressive tumors, with approximately half of patients
deriving clinical benefit. Our study suggests that doxorubicin-based combination regimens may be associated with superior survival to that achieved with
single-agent doxorubicin, although this has yet to be
confirmed in prospective randomized trials. Other
factors predictive of superior survival in our cohort
of patients included younger age, absence of bone
metastases, and synovial or liposarcoma histology.
Nevertheless, despite the short-term benefits of
chemotherapy for certain patient subgroups, continuing research into new therapeutic agents for STS is
required to improve the treatment of patients with
locally advanced and metastatic disease, whose longterm outlook remains bleak.
