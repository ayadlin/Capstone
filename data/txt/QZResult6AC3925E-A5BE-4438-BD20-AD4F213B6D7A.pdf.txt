ABSTRACT
Activation of eIF4B correlates with Abl-mediated cellular transformation,
but the precise mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we show that eIF4B is a
convergent substrate of JAK/STAT/Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in Abl
transformants. Both pathways phosphorylated eIF4B in Abl-transformed cells, and
such redundant regulation was responsible for the limited effect of single inhibitor
on Abl oncogenicity. Persistent inhibition of one signaling pathway induced the
activation of the other pathway and thereby restored the phosphorylation levels of
eIF4B. Simultaneous inhibition of the two pathways impaired eIF4B phosphorylation
more effectively, and synergistically induced apoptosis in Abl transformed cells and
inhibited the growth of engrafted tumors in nude mice. Similarly, the survival of
Abl transformants exhibited a higher sensitivity to the pharmacological inhibition,
when combined with the shRNA-based silence of the other pathway. Interestingly,
such synergy was dependent on the phosphorylation status of eIF4B on Ser422, as
overexpression of eIF4B phosphomimetic mutant S422E in the transformants greatly
attenuated the synergistic effects of these inhibitors on Abl oncogenicity. In contrast,
eIF4B knockdown sensitized Abl transformants to undergo apoptosis induced by the
combined blockage. Collectively, the results indicate that eIF4B integrates the signals
from Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in Abl-expressing leukemic cells, and is a
promising therapeutic target for such cancers.

(JAK/STAT)-dependent Pim signaling and PI3K/Akt/
mTOR that are critically involved in the regulation of
cell proliferation and survival [1, 4–6]. Despite extensive
studies, the precise mechanism underlying Abl-induced
hematopoietic malignances is not fully elucidated [4–7].
In particular, the relationship between JAK/STAT/Pim and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in Abl transformants is poorly
understood.
Growing evidence suggests that alterations in
protein expression occur in various cancers [8, 9].
However, the precise pathogenic processes remain to be
unveiled. It has been shown that Abl oncoproteins not
only activate the transcription of numerous genes involved

INTRODUCTION
Abl oncoproteins, including v-Abl, Bcr-Abl and
Tel-Abl, are activated non-receptor tyrosine kinases that
are associated with various malignant transformations
of hematopoietic cells [1–3]. v-Abl, the retrovirally
transduced product of Abl, contributes to murine pre-B
cell malignant transformation [1]. Bcr-Abl, resulting
from chimeric chromosome translocation, is the major
cause of human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
[2]. Expression of Abl kinase constitutively activates
multiple signaling pathways, including Janus family of
kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription

in cell proliferation or survival, but also dysregulate
the mRNA translation program of such genes [9–11].
Under normal circumstances, the translation processes
are accomplished by coordinated events and precisely
controlled by a variety of regulatory elements in a signal
dependent pattern [12–14]. Among the steps of mRNA
translation, the control of translation rate is preferentially
exerted at the initiation phase, which is crucial for the
specific expression of genes important for cell growth,
proliferation, and survival [12–14].
For eukaryotic translation initiation, an essential
event is the assembly of the translation pre-initiation
complex (PIC) [13, 14], which contains various eukaryotic
translation initiation factors (eIFs) [13, 15]. In particular,
eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A constitute a complex named
eIF4F that is critical to mRNA translation initiation
[13–15]. The ribosome recruitment to the 5′ ends of
eukaryotic mRNAs is mediated by the eIF4F complex in
which eIF4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, melts the
secondary structure of mRNA for the subsequent scanning
[16]. eIF4B is thought to stimulate eIF4F activity through
enhancing the eIF4A RNA helicase activity in unwinding
secondary structures in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR)
of the mRNA [13, 15, 16]. Therefore, eIF4B is a key
component in control of the major rate-limiting step of
protein synthesis.
eIF4B is involved in translation of numerous
proliferative or anti-apoptotic mRNAs with highly
structured 5′UTR and subsequently affect cell growth
and survival [17, 18]. Abnormal protein levels or
phosphorylation levels of eIF4B are associated with a
variety of tumors including Abl-positive CML, T-cell
lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, Kaposi sarcoma,
and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [18–21]. Recently,
we have observed that eIF4B is highly phosphorylated in
Abl transformants and promotes both Bcr-Abl and v-Ablmediated cellular transformation [4]. Remarkably, eIF4B
knockdown impairs the transforming efficiency by Abl
oncoproteins [4].
The activity of eIF4B relies on its phosphorylation
status [22, 23]. It has been identified that Ser422 is the
main phosphorylation site of eIF4B targeted by several
signaling cascades, and the phosphorylation level of
Ser422 is important for its role in tumorigenesis [22–24].
Recently, we have identified eIF4B as a substrate for
both Pim-1 and Pim-2 kinases in Abl transformants and
demonstrated that Ser422 is a critical residue in eIF4B
that can be regulated by Abl-dependent signaling [4].
Besides, eIF4B can also be phosphorylated by AGC
protein kinase family [22–25]. For example, ribosomal
S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and Akt can phosphorylate
eIF4B on Ser422 residue [24]. Both S6K and Akt are
key components of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and
activated by phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1
(PDK1), a downstream molecule of PI3K. In PDK1-null
cells, eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation is abrogated [22].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Additionally, it has been demonstrated that p90 ribosomal
protein S6 kinase (RSK) can also mediate eIF4B Ser422
phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation
[22]. Together, these data suggest that eIF4B may be a
common substrate of several crucial signaling pathways
involved in cell proliferation and survival. However, it
is still unclear how eIF4B mediates the effects of these
kinases on cellular transformation, and little information
is available about whether there exists an interaction
between these signaling pathways in Abl transformants.
In this study, we found that eIF4B was a common
substrate of oncogenic Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathways in Abl transformants, and such redundant
activation of eIF4B is responsible for the compromised
effect of pharmacological inhibition of single pathway
on Abl tumorigenesis. By contrast, combined treatment
to block both pathways caused a deeper inhibition of
eIF4B phosphorylation, induced more apoptosis in Abl
transformed cells, and synergistically inhibited K562
xenograft growth in nude mice. Overexpression of eIF4B
phosphomimetic mutant S422E remarkably attenuated the
synergistic effects of these inhibitors on suppression of Abl
oncogenicity. These results establish a key role of eIF4B in
Abl tumorigenesis by integrating the functions of oncogenic
Pim and Akt signaling pathways, and highlight eIF4B as a
novel therapeutic target for Abl positive cancers.

RESULTS
Phosphorylation of eIF4B is regulated by PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway in v-Abl and Bcr-Abl
transformants
Recently, we observed that phosphorylation of eIF4B
was not completely abolished by disrupting the expression
of Pim-1 and Pim-2, implying that there exists other Ser/
Thr kinase(s) responsible for eIF4B phosphorylation in
Abl-expressing leukemic cells [4]. To test this possibility,
we employed several pharmacological inhibitors and
shRNAs to determine the involvement of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway in this event. Indeed, the phosphorylation
levels of eIF4B Ser422 in Bcr-Abl (K562) or v-Abl (NS2
and W44) positive leukemic cells decreased significantly
in response to treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002
(Figure 1A and 1B and Supplementary Figure S1A). Our
previous studies revealed that STAT/Pim-1 and mTOR/
S6K pathways phosphorylate eIF4B mainly on Ser422 in
Abl transformants [4], and it was shown that inhibition
of Akt had no effect on eIF4B Ser406 phosphorylation
in A14 cells [23]. To verify whether PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway contributes to eIF4B Ser406 phosphorylation
in Abl transformants, we examined the phosphorylation
of eIF4B Ser406 in response to LY294002 treatment. In
contrast to Ser422, inhibition of PI3K had no significant
effect on Ser406 phosphorylation in both Bcr-Abl and
v-Abl transformants (Figure 1A and 1B). To confirm this

finding, we generated stable K562, NS2 and W44 cells
expressing shRNAs specifically targeting PDK1, another
downstream effector of PI3K and an upstream regulator
of Akt/S6K [22]. As predicted, knockdown of PDK1
inactivated Akt and S6K, and resulted in remarkable
suppression of eIF4B S422 phosphorylation but had little
effect on Ser406 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure
S1B and S1C and Figure 1C).
Furthermore, we observed that the phosphorylation
level of eIF4B Ser422 was obviously reduced by treatment
with Akti-1/2, an isozyme-selective inhibitor of Akt (Figure
1D and 1E and Supplementary Figure S1D). Consistent with
previous reports [23], Ser406 was little affected by Akti-1/2
treatment (Figure 1D and 1E). To directly demonstrate the
involvement of Akt in eIF4B phosphorylation, we generated
stable Abl-expressing cells expressing shRNA to Akt1. As
expected, the phosphorylation level of eIF4B on Ser422,
not on Ser406, was markedly decreased by silencing Akt1
in both Bcr-Abl and v-Abl positive cells (Figure 1F and 1G
and Supplementary Figure S1E-S1G).
In addition, rapamycin was employed to determine
the functional relevance of mTOR, a downstream effector of
PI3K/Akt pathway, in eIF4B phosphorylation. Interestingly,
treatment of cells with rapamycin also significantly impaired
the eIF4B phosphorylation on Ser422 but had no obvious
effect on Ser406 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure
S1H and S1I and Figure S1H). Because a previous study
using an in vitro kinase assay showed that Akt can directly
phosphorylate eIF4B on Ser422 [23], we asked whether
Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4B totally required
activation of mTOR/S6K signaling in Abl transformants.
To address this issue, eIF4B wild-type or its Ser422Ala
mutant was co-transfected with either Akt wild-type or its
active form in 293T and K562 cells. We found that forced
expression of Akt, especially its active mutants, markedly
elevated the eIF4B phosphorylation (Figure 1I). Treatment
with rapamycin potently suppressed eIF4B phosphorylation
in the control cells transfected with empty vector, but failed
to completely block eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation induced
by overexpression of either wild-type or active form of
Akt (Figure 1J and Supplementary Figure S1J). Together,
these data suggest that PI3K/Akt pathway regulates eIF4B
Ser422 phosphorylation in both mTOR/S6K-dependent and
-independent manners in Abl transformants.

types [5, 26, 27]. These findings prompted us to further
address whether there is a cross-talk between STAT/
Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and whether the two
pathways co-operatively regulate eIF4B phosphorylation
in Abl transformants. To this end, we blocked one pathway
persistently, and then examined the activity of the other
pathway. Interestingly, the activity of Akt was greatly
upregulated by long time treatment of Bcr-Abl- or v-Abltransformed cells with Pim inhibitor SMI-4a (Figure 2A and
2B). Importantly, although eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation
was at first suppressed by addition of SMI-4a, it was finally
restored following upregulation of Akt activity after longer
time treatment with the compound (Figure 2A–2D). To test
whether this phenomenon was due to the loss of SMI-4a
activity, we investigated the expression of c-Myc, since Pim
inhibition can reduce c-Myc levels [28, 29]. As shown in
Figure 2A and 2B, c-Myc expression remained suppressed
during this period, suggesting that SMI-4a was functional.
Next, we asked whether STAT/Pim signaling could
be activated by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway. Indeed, persistent blockage of PI3K by
LY294002 resulted in activation of STAT5 and increased
expression of Pim-1 (Figure 2E and 2F). Similarly, eIF4B
Ser422 phosphorylation was inhibited by LY294002
treatment at short time point, but was then significantly
restored following upregulation of Pim-1 expression
induced by longer time treatment with LY294002 (Figure
2E–2H). Similar results were obtained from long time
treatment with Akti-1/2 or rapamycin (Supplementary
Figure S2A-S2H).
To corroborate whether the restoration of eIF4B
phosphorylation resulted from enhanced activation of
the other pathway due to persistent inhibition of one
signaling pathway, we performed similar experiments
as described in Figure 2A-2H except that the second
inhibitor was added at late time points. As shown in
Figure 2I, addition of Pim inhibitor SMI-4a at late time
points prevented long term PI3K inhibition-induced
eIF4B phosphorylation in K562 cells, suggesting that
elevated Pim expression is responsible for the restoration
of eIF4B phosphorylation. Inversely, addition of
LY294002 at late time points also blocked long term
Pim inhibition-induced eIF4B phosphorylation in the
cells (Supplementary Figure S2I). Taken together, these
data reveal that persistent inhibition of one signaling
pathway results in upregulation of the other pathway,
which can restore eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation in Abl
transformants.

groups have also demonstrated that there exists a feedback

signaling in Abl transformants. Hence, we reasoned that
combined inhibition of the two pathways would suppress
eIF4B phosphorylation more effectively than inhibition of
a signaling pathway. To test this concept, K562 cells were
treated with SMI-4a and LY294002 simultaneously and
eIF4B phosphorylation was examined at indicated time
points (Figure 3A). As expected, the combined treatment
displayed greater inhibition of eIF4B phosphorylation on
Ser422 compared with the single treatment. Quantitative
analysis of immunoblots by densitometry showed that
eIF4B phosphorylation decreased more significantly by
the combined inhibition of Pim and PI3K than the single
inhibition (Supplementary Figure S3A). This observation
was further confirmed by the combination using SMI-4a/
Akti-1/2 or SMI-4a/rapamycin (Figure 3B and 3C and
Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C). Similar results
were obtained from experiments using SMI-4a/LY294002,
SMI-4a/Akti-1/2, or SMI-4a/rapamycin to treat v-Abl
transformants (Figure 3D–3I and Supplementary Figure
S3D-S3I). These data suggest that combined inhibition
of Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways is required for
efficient suppression of eIF4B phosphorylation in Bcr-Abl
or v-Abl transformed cells.

high concentrations of each inhibitor on apoptosis in
Abl transformants (Supplementary Figure S4C-S4E).
The results showed that treatment of the cells with high
concentrations of single agent did not create a profound
effect on inducing apoptosis as treatment with combined
compounds did, suggesting that the synergy indeed
resulted from the combinational inhibition of Pim and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways.
Next, the synergistic effect of the combined
treatment on inducing apoptosis was tested in v-Abltransformed cells. Strikingly, treatment with SMI-4a/
LY294002 or SMI-4a/Akti-1/2 greatly sensitized NS2 cells
to undergo apoptosis (Figure 4E–4H and Supplementary
Figure S5A). Approximately 75% and 74% of NS2 cells
were viable after 24 h incubation with 12.5 μM SMI-4a
and 20 μM LY294002, respectively, but only 33% of
cells remained viable after the combined treatment with
12.5 μM SMI-4a plus 20 μM LY294002 under the same
condition (Figure 4E). The combinational treatment with
SMI-4a/Akti-1/2 also induced synergistic apoptosis in
NS2 cells (Figure 4G), as all CI values calculated were
less than 1 (Figure 4F and 4H). Similar results were
obtained from experiments using SMI-4a and rapamycin
(Supplementary Figure S5B-S5F). Together, these data
establish that the combined inhibition of Pim and PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling has synergistic effect on inducing
apoptosis in Abl transformants.

Disruption of one pathway confers Abl
transformants more sensitive to inhibition of
the other pathway

Phosphorylated eIF4B was previously shown to
play a crucial role in regulating cell survival [4]. Having
demonstrated that simultaneous inhibition of Pim and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling had a more profound inhibitory
effect on eIF4B phosphorylation, next we studied whether
the combined treatment influences the apoptosis of Abl
transformants. Bcr-Abl-expressing K562 cells were treated
with combination of SMI-4a and LY294002 at various
concentrations for 48 h, and cell viability was examined
by FACS after staining with Annexin V-FITC/PI (Figure
4A). We found that approximately 79% and 85% of K562
cells were viable after incubation with 12.5 μM SMI-4a
or 20 μM LY294002 alone for 48 h, respectively, under
our experimental condition. However, only 34% of the
cells remained viable when treated with 12.5 μM SMI-4a
plus 20 μM LY294002 under the same condition (Figure
4A). By the software analysis [30], we found that the
combined index (CI) values for the combination of SMI4a and LY294002 at different concentrations were all
less than 1 (Figure 4B), indicating that this combination
induces strong synergic apoptosis in K562 cells. Similar
results were observed in K562 cells treated with SMI-4a
and Akti-1/2 (Figure 4C and 4D), as well as SMI-4a and
rapamycin (Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B).
To rule out the possibility that the higher
concentrations of combined compounds or vehicle
DMSO induced such synergy, we tested the effect of

To further define the relationship between STAT/
Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and their role in
regulating eIF4B phosphorylation, genetic manipulation
of individual signaling molecules in the two pathways
was taken to examine the effects of suppressing these
pathways on eIF4B phosphorylation and Abl transformant
survival. For this, we generated Abl-transformed cells
stably expressing shRNAs to either PDK1, Akt1, S6K1,
or Pim-1. These cells were then treated with either Pim
inhibitor or PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, followed by
assessing eIF4B S422 phosphorylation and cell survival,
as described above. We found that knockdown of PDK1
strengthened the inhibitory effect of Pim inhibitor SMI4a on eIF4B S422 phosphorylation in K562 cells (Figure
5A and Supplementary Figure S6A). Using Annexin
V/7-AAD staining followed by FACS, we observed that
approximately 62% of control cells were viable after 48
h treatment with 25 μM SMI-4a, but only approximately
42% of PDK1 knockdown cells remained viable under the
same condition (Figure 5B). Similar results were obtained
from Akt1 knockdown K562 and W44 cells (Figure 5C5F and Supplementary Figure S6B and S6C). Likewise,
silencing Akt significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect
of Pim inhibitor SMI-4a on eIF4B S422 phosphorylation

Abl transformants to undergo apoptosis induced by the
drug (Figure 5D and 5F). Moreover, silencing S6K1
also potentiated the inhibitory effect of Pim inhibitor
SMI-4a on eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation (Figure 5G
and Supplementary Figure S6D), and enhanced SMI-4ainduced apoptosis of Abl transformants (Figure 5H).
In addition, we determined whether forced
expression of Akt1 wild-type (WT) or the active form
Akt1-E17K affects eIF4B phosphorylation and cell
survival in response to SMI-4a treatment. Interestingly,
overexpression of Akt1, especially Akt1-E17K, conferred
high resistance to SMI-4a treatment, as evidenced by
attenuated inhibition of eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation
and cell survival, compared to control (Supplementary
Figure S6E-S6G).
On the other hand, Pim-1 knockdown cells were
treated with PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, followed by
the same analyses as described above. As shown in
Figure 5I and Supplementary Figure S6H, eIF4B S422
phosphorylation in Pim-1 knockdown cells decreased
significantly, compared with that in control cells after
treatment with Akti-1/2. About 36% of Pim-1 knockdown
cells were viable after treatment with 20 μM Akti-1/2 for
48 h, while approximately 60% of control cells remained
viable under the same condition (Figure 5J), indicating
that silencing Pim-1 sensitized Abl transformants to
undergo apoptosis induced by Akti-1/2. Similar results
were obtained from experiments using Pim-1 knockdown
cells treated with rapamycin (Figure 5K and 5L and
Supplementary Figure S6I). Together, these results suggest
that disruption of one pathway alters the sensitivity of
Abl transformants to inhibition of the other pathway by
mediating eIF4B phosphorylation.

alone (Figure 6A and 6B). SMI-4a in combination with
Akti-1/2 suppressed the tumor growth in a synergistic
manner, as determined by the formula AB/C < A/C × B/C
described previously [31] and in Materials and Methods
(AB/C = 0.162, A/C = 0.682, B/C = 0.555, A/C × B/C
=0.379). Moreover, combined treatment with SMI-4a and
Akti-1/2 inhibited eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation more
significantly than that with SMI-4a or Akti-1/2 alone
(Figure 6C and 6D).
In addition, similar experiments using SMI-4a and
rapamycin were performed. As shown in Figure 6E and
6F, combined treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg of SMI4a and 10 mg/kg of rapamycin also suppressed the tumor
growth in a synergistic manner (AB/C = 0.134, A/C =
0.705, B/C = 0.573, A/C × B/C =0.404). These results
were further confirmed by bioluminescent imaging (Figure
6G). Furthermore, Western blotting analysis of tumor
lysates showed that eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation was
more significantly reduced by the combined inhibition
of Pim and mTOR as compared to the single inhibitions
(Figure 6H and 6I).

Decreased phosphorylation of eIF4B on Ser422
is responsible for synergic inhibitory effect on
cell survival by combined blockage of Pim and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways
Having revealed that eIF4B is a common substrate
of Pim kinase and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, we
hypothesized that eIF4B phosphorylation on Ser422 might
be critical for synergic apoptosis of Abl transformants
induced by the combinational treatment. To test this
hypothesis, firstly we generated K562 cells stably
expressing shRNAs targeting eIF4B (Figure 7A and 7B).
We found that compared to control, disruption of eIF4B
expression significantly sensitized K562 leukemic cells
to undergo apoptosis induced by combined treatment
with SMI-4a and rapamycin (Figure 7C), suggesting the
functional significance of eIF4B in the regulation of Abltransformed cell survival by Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathways. Furthermore, we generated stable K562 cells
expressing either eIF4B-WT, its phosphomimetic mutant
eIF4B-S422E, or empty vector control (Figure 7D). When
the cells were treated with 12.5 μM SMI-4a and 10 μM
Akti-1/2 for 48 h, the cell viability in the control, eIF4BWT, and eIF4E-S422E cells was reduced to approximately
36%, 42% and 61%, respectively (Figure 7E). Similar
results were obtained from experiments using combined
treatment with SMI-4a and rapamycin (Figure 7F). The
results suggest that the synergic effect of combined
inhibition of Pim and Akt/mTOR on cell survival could be
substantially attenuated by forcing expression of eIF4B
S422E mutant.
To confirm the importance of eIF4B Ser422
phosphorylation in Abl-mediated tumorigenesis, we
further performed xenograft experiments using K562

Combined inhibition of Pim and PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathways suppresses the growth of K562
tumor engrafted in nude mice in a synergistic
manner
In an attempt to explore the feasibility of this
combined therapeutic strategy for treatment of Ablmediated tumorigenesis, we tested the efficacy of
inhibiting both Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in
a mouse xenograft model. Each mouse was inoculated
subcutaneously with the same amount of K562 cells, and
administration of either single agent (SMI-4a or Akti-1/2),
combination (SMI-4a and Akti-1/2), or mock was then
conducted on day 11 after inoculation of the cells. On the
29th day after inoculation, tumors were removed from mice
and their volumes were measured as previously described
[4]. We observed that the combined treatment with 50 mg/
kg of SMI-4a and 80 mg/kg of Akti-1/2 inhibited Ablmediated tumor growth more potently than the treatment
with either 50 mg/kg of SMI-4a or 80 mg/kg of Akti-1/2

cells stably expressing either eIF4B-WT, eIF4B-S422E,
or empty vector. Mice were inoculated with equal amount
of each cell type and treated with the combination of
SMI-4a and rapamycin as described above. Indeed, the
synergic inhibition of tumor growth by the combined
treatment was greatly compromised by the expression
of eIF4B-S422E in K562 cells (Figure 7G and 7H).
The ectopic expression of eIF4B proteins in tumors was
confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 7I). Together, these
data indicate that eIF4B functions downstream of STAT/
Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in Abl transformants,
and Ser422 phosphorylation is associated with synergic
inhibitory effects on cell survival and tumor growth
induced by combined blockage of Pim and PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathways.

Elevated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 3b (eIF3b) correlates to human bladder and prostate
cancer progression [39]. In addition, oncogenic Pim-2
kinase has also been shown to modulate the translation
initiation repressor eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [35,
40]. It has also been found that there exists a convergent
crosstalk between ERK and Akt signaling pathways that
converge on 4E-BP1 to control its activity [41–43]. Thus,
4E-BP1 controls tumor growth through integrating the
functions of Akt and ERK signaling pathways [41–43].
Previous experiments have demonstrated that there coexists activation of oncogenic Pim and Akt pathways
in Abl-transformed cells [4–6]. Here we observed that
persistent inhibition of one signaling pathway strikingly
induced the activation of the other pathway, causing the
Abl-expressing leukemic cells to become dependent on
the latter. These data reveal the molecular basis for the
limited activity of the single Pim or Akt inhibitor in Abltransformed cells and the profound synergy observed
with combined inhibition of the dual pathways. In this
study, for the first time, we provide evidence that eIF4B
is a convergent target of Pim and Akt pathways in Abl
transformants. Reduced phosphorylation of eIF4B on
Ser422 correlates with the synergistic anticancer activity
of the combined treatment to block the two pathways.
This is strongly supported by the observation that
ectopic expression of eIF4B phosphomimetic mutant
S422E dramatically attenuated the synergic effects of the
combined treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that
eIF4B integrates the functions of Pim and Akt signaling
pathways to stimulate Abl-mediated tumorigenesis.
Accumulating evidence suggests that redundant
activation of multiple signaling pathways may converge
on common targets that integrate their functions in
cancers. For example, BCL2-associated agonist of cell
death (BAD) functions as a shared target of Akt and ERK
signaling in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
deficient tumor cells [32]. Phosphorylation of BAD by
either Akt or ERK is sufficient to suppress the activity
of BAD. However, only inhibiting the two pathways
simultaneously can activate BAD and induce apoptosis
in tumor cells [32]. On the other hand, occurrence of
activation of multiple pathways is a major cause of
drug resistance in tumor cells. For example, melanoma
cells display enhanced activation of PI3K signaling
after treatment with BRAF inhibitor, resulting in tumor
cell resistance to the drug challenges [33]. In addition
to ERK signaling, activation of other pathways is also
responsible for the limited effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
inhibitors on tumorigenesis [31, 35, 36]. In lymphoma,
overexpression of Pim kinases results in resistance to
mTOR inhibitors [35]. In metastatic breast cancer, genetic
or pharmacological inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 makes
cells more sensitive to PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors [31].
These studies suggest that growth of tumors carrying
oncogenes activating multiple pathways is not dependent

DISCUSSION
Abl-mediated tumorigenesis of hematopoietic
cells involves various complex mechanisms including
dysregulation of gene transcription and alterations in
protein synthesis important for cell growth and apoptosis
[9, 10]. In this study, we show that eIF4B is a key
convergent substrate of Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR path­
ways in Abl-transformed cells. Selective inhibition or
silencing of Pim (with SMI-4a), PI3K (with LY294002),
Akt (with Akti-1/2), or mTOR (with rapamycin) was able,
to some extent, to impair eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation
in the cells. Although both JAK/STAT/Pim and PIK3/Akt/
mTOR pathways are involved in mediating phosphorylation
of eIF4B on Ser422 in Abl transformants, Pim kinases
may contribute more to this process [4]. In normal cells,
coordinated regulation of eIF4B phosphorylation by
multiple signaling pathways may be required for efficient
cell proliferation and growth. However, this redundant
mechanism of eIF4B activation can be hijacked by cancer
cells to evade pharmacological treatment and develop drug
tolerance, thus resulting in short-lived single agent targeted
tumor therapy [30–36]. Indeed, our data reveal that single
targeting Pim or PI3K pathway displayed limited inhibitory
effect on survival and growth of Abl-transformed cells,
especially after long-term treatment with single compound.
Furthermore, such failure was found to result from the
parallel redundant pathway that provides enough ability
to restore eIF4B phosphorylation. Thus, the combined
treatment that abrogates the Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathways is able to impair the phosphorylation of eIF4B
more effectively, leading to profound inhibitory effect on
Abl-mediated tumorigenesis in a synergistic manner.
It has been shown that components of the translation
initiation machinery are often deregulated in various
cancer cells [4, 8–11, 15, 21, 30, 37]. For example, aberrant
activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E) has been shown to be critical for tumorigenesis
of a number of cancers including lymphomas,
angiosarcomas, lung carcinomas, and hepatomas [38].

on a single signaling pathway. Therefore, it is important
to identify the common targets that integrate the functions
of multiple pathways. The mechanism underlying the
redundant regulation still remains unclear. It might be
explained partially by the polyclonal and polygenic nature
of cancer cells [36]. Some investigations suggest that such
redundancy may increase fitness of cancer cells in certain
unfavorable environments [30, 44, 45]. Consistent with
this hypothesis, our data show that genetic disruption of
either Pim or Akt pathway sensitized Abl transformants
to undergo apoptosis induced by inhibition of the
other, and inhibition of both was required to efficiently
suppress Abl oncogenicity. Previous studies revealed that
silencing eIF4B expression is sufficient to inhibit Abl
transformation [4]. Here we show that eIF4B integrates the
functions of oncogenic Pim and Akt signaling pathways.
These findings suggest that eIF4B may be a candidate for
targeted therapy against the malignancies in which both
Pim and Akt pathways are activated. However, further
studies are needed to determine the clinical significance
of directly targeting eIF4B in CML patient samples and
other cancers.

were purchased as follows: Pim kinase inhibitor SMI4a (526523, Merck), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (L9908,
Sigma), Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2 (124018, Merck), and
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (SC-3504A, Santa Cruz). All
other antibodies and reagents were obtained as previously
described [4, 5, 48].

Cell apoptosis and proliferation assays
Apoptosis assay was performed as previously
described [4, 5]. Briefly, cells were cultured with certain
inhibitors for indicated time. Then cells were stained
with 2.5 μg/ml Annexin V-FITC and 1 μg/ml PI. For
cells overexpressing or silencing given genes, samples
were stained with 2.5 μg/ml Annexin V-APC and 1 μg/ml
7-AAD. Samples were examined by fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (FACS) (BD Bioscience) as previously described
[5] and data were analyzed by FCS Express V3 Software
(De Novo Software). For experiments using combined
treatment, the synergism was evaluated by the combination
index (CI) which was calculated using Chou-Talalay
method by CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc.) [49,
50]. Briefly, CI value < 1 represents synergistic effect, CI
values = 1 additive effect, and CIs > 1 antagonistic effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animal experiments

Cell lines, cell culture and Western blotting

K562 cells (5 × 106 cells per mouse) were
transplanted subcutaneously into Balb/c nude mice (5-6
weeks old) (Vital River, Beijing, China). Starting from the
11th day after inoculation, mice were treated with inhibitors
or mock every other day and tumor volume was monitored
simultaneously. SMI-4a (50 mg/kg) and Akti-1/2 (80 mg/
kg) were administered orally every other day. Rapamycin
(10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally every two days.
At 8 h after the 10th treatment, mice were sacrificed and
tumors were removed for further analysis. Tumor sizes were
analyzed for synergism according to the formula AB/C <
A/C × B/C, where A was the tumor volume treated with
inhibitor 1, B was the tumor volume treated with inhibitor
2, AB was the tumor volume treated with inhibitors 1 and
2, and C was the tumor volume of control group [31].
Bioluminescent imaging was performed at day 21 after
inoculation, and photography and image quantification were
carried out as previously described [7].

Cell lines K562 and 293T were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured
in RPMI-1640 or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as
described previously [4]. The v-Abl transformed mice
pre-B cell lines NS2 and W44 were generated and
cultured as previously described [1]. These cell lines
were characterized in our laboratory as CD10+/CD19+
pre-B cells. Abl transformants stably expressing short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting human or mouse PDK1,
Akt1, S6K1, Pim-1, eIF4B were generated by infection
with lentiviruses as described previously [4, 46, 47].
Paired shRNA sequences were designed and listed in
the Supplementary Materials and Methods section.
Western blotting was performed as described previously
[4, 5]. Briefly, total cell extracts were separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with indicated
antibodies. Where indicated, immunoblotting signals were
quantified by densitometry [4].

DNA construction
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing constructs
were generated as previously described [4]. The shRNA
sequences targeting human eIF4B, human Pim-1 and
human/mouse S6K1, were described previously [4]. The
shRNA sequences are shown as follows:
human Akt1: 5′-CGCGTGACCATGAACGAGTTT-3′
and 5′-CGAGTTTGAGTACCTGAAGCT-3′; mouse Akt1:
5′-CGTGTGACCATGAACGAGTTT-3′ and 5′-CGAGTT
TGAGTACCTGAAGCT-3′); human PDK1: 5′-CAAAGT
