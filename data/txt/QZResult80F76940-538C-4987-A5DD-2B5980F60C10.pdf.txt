BACKGROUND. Pain is a common symptom for patients with cancer, and opioids
are the treatment of choice for moderate or severe cancer-related pain. Central
side effects, such as drowsiness, confusion, and hallucinations, can limit the use
of opioids in clinical practice.

METHODS. The authors prospectively recruited 228 cancer patients who received
morphine. Clinical data, including pain and side-effect scores, were correlated
with genotype data.

RESULTS. Genetic variation in the multidrug resistance-1 gene (MDR-1) was

associated with moderate or severe drowsiness and confusion or hallucinations.
Patients who carried the common guanosine (G) allele at position 2677 in exon
26 were less likely to experience drowsiness and confusion or hallucinations than
patients who carried the variant thymidine or adenosine alleles, which code for
alternate amino-acid substitutions (chi-square statistic, 13.3; P 5 .0003). In addition, genetic variation in the catechol-O-methyltansferase (COMT) enzyme was
associated independently with these central side effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 1 were associated significantly with central side
effects; the most significant was at position 24873G (chi-square statistic, 9.1;
P 5 .003). SNPs in intron 1, defined as haplotype, were present in 10.4% of the
population and were associated significantly with central side effects (chi-square
statistic, 7.7; P 5 .005). Genotype data did not correlate with morphine dose or
serum morphine or metabolite concentrations in this study.

CONCLUSIONS. COMT and MDR-1 genotypes were correlated with morphinerelated central side effects. The authors believe that this work adds significantly
to the current understanding of genetic variants that may influence an individual’s response to opioids. Cancer 2008;112:1390–403.  2008 American Cancer

lthough morphine is the opioid of choice for the treatment of
moderate to severe cancer pain,1 from 10% to 30% of patients
who receive oral morphine do not have successful outcomes either
because of intolerable adverse effects, or inadequate analgesia, or a
combination of both.2 This is a significant problem. In clinical practice, dose-limiting side effects prevent further dose escalation and
limit the degree of analgesia that can be achieved. Patients who do
not receive the desired analgesic effect or who suffer intolerable
side effects from morphine often are ‘‘switched’’ to alternative

strong opioids. Opioid switching, or changing from
morphine to an alternative opioid, is a therapeutic
maneuver that is gaining popularity in pain management as a method of improving analgesic response
and/or reducing adverse side effects.3,4 In 1 study,
this strategy of opioid switching achieved good pain
control with minimal side effects in 96% of patients.5
The commonest side effects that limit dose titration
are central side effects, such as drowsiness and confusion.
The Human Genome Project has led to an
increase in pharmacogenomic research with the
hope that, in the future, drug therapies may be tailored individually. There are well known examples in
which monogenic (single gene) traits affect drug metabolism and response.6 In pain, genetic variation in
the cytochrome p450 enzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) affects
codeine metabolism and analgesic response.7,8 However, for most drugs, drug effect and treatment outcomes are determined by the interplay of multiple
genes, with no single predominant factor.
Candidate genes that influence both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors will be important. Morphine acts through the G protein-coupled
l-opioid receptor. Agonist-induced activation of the
receptor inhibits neuronal transmission of painful stimuli through a complex signaling cascade.9 Recently,
an important regulator of l-opioid receptor desensitization has been identified, the intracellular protein barrestin2.10–12 In b-arrestin2 knockout mice, morphine
analgesia is increased and prolonged.13 Different
opioids induce different rates of receptor internalization and desensitization.14 In clinical practice, genetic
variation in b-arrestin2 is associated with the need
to switch from morphine to an alternative opioid,
although genetic variation in the l-opioid receptor
itself did not correlate with morphine response.15
The membrane-bound drug transporter P-glycoprotein is important in regulating drugs crossing the
blood-brain barrier. It actively pumps drugs out of
the central nervous system (CNS) and, thus, may
affect the frequency of opioid-induced CNS side
effects.16 Interindividual variability in P-glycoprotein
activity is well recognized, and genetic variation in
the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene MDR-1, which
encodes for P-glycoprotein, alters P-glycoprotein
activity.17,18
Response to a painful stimulus is regulated by
interactions between multiple regions within the
brain through different neurochemical pathways.19
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme
that metabolizes the catecholamines dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, which are important
neurotransmitters in the brain. There is growing

1391

evidence to support interaction between dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways and opioid signaling
pathways in the CNS.20–24
The COMT gene is polymorphic, and the most
widely studied variant in this gene is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) adenosine (A) to guanosine (G) substitution at nucleotide 1222 (A1222G)
(reference sequence 4680), which causes an aminoacid substitution of valine (Val) for methionine (Met)
in the transcribed protein. This variant causes a 3- to
4-fold decrease in enzyme activity25 and has been
shown to affect l-opioid neurotransmitter responses
to a pain stressor in normal volunteers.24 Individuals
who were homozygous for the methionine variant
had higher sensory and affective ratings to pain. At
baseline, they had increased expression of l-opioid
receptors in multiple regions of the brain; however,
in response to pain, they had decreased activation of
the l-opioid because of decreased release of endogenous opioids.
Studies of the COMT gene have indicated that
SNPs in the promoter, intron 1, and the 30 -untranslated region may be linked more strongly to disease,26,27 emphasizing the importance of haplotype
analysis of multiple SNPs across the gene.28 However,
correlation between these SNPs and neuronal COMT
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression has been inconsistent.29,30 Diatchenko et al. used 4 SNPs to define a
high, average, and low pain-sensitivity haplotype in
normal volunteers who had variable pain perception
and risk of developing chronic temporomandibular
joint pain.31
We wanted to investigate whether or not a functional polymorphism in the MDR-1 gene, which is
responsible for the production of differing concentrations of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, is relevant to the need for cancer patients to switch from
morphine to an alternative opioid. Furthermore, it
was been demonstrated previously that the COMT
gene has influence in relation to pain24,31 and morphine dose32; thus, it was a double candidate for
investigation in our study. From a previous study, we
also hypothesized that other factors apart from pain
may relate to the need to switch.5 For this reason, a
sophisticated database was designed for the current
study to include factors that would be markers of
central side effects in which the passage of morphine
and its metabolites across the blood-brain barrier
may be critical.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

detail elsewhere.5,15 Briefly, patients who received
morphine for cancer-related pain were identified
prospectively by the palliative care team. It is important to stress that all patients received morphine that
was titrated to achieve the desired analgesic effect.
Those who did not achieve good clinical benefit
because of inadequate pain relief and/or unacceptable side effects were switched actively to an alternative opioid, oxycodone. All patients completed a
modified Brief Pain Inventory33 and recorded both
their degree of pain over the previous 24 hours for 5
separate pain parameters (numerical rating scale
from 0 to 10 for average pain, worst pain, least pain,
pain now, and percentage pain relief) and side
effects they believed were related to morphine (4point scale: ‘‘not at all,’’ ‘‘a little,’’ ‘‘quite a bit,’’ ‘‘very
much’’). The database included demographic data
(age, ethnicity, cancer diagnosis), current opioid use,
opioid history, and current medications. Blood samples were taken for hematologic and biochemical
analyses and DNA extraction. DNA was extracted by
using a modified salting-out method34 and was
stored at 220 8C for genotype analysis. The primary
analysis compared 2 phenotypes: controls, who had
taken morphine for at least 1 month with good pain
relief and minimal side effects; and switchers, who,
despite adequate dose escalation, had inadequate
analgesia or intolerable side-effects on morphine and
required switching to an alternative opioid.
Putative SNPs in the COMT and MDR-1 genes
were identified from the literature and SNP databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, http://snpper.
chip.org/bio). At the time of commencement of this
work, no added information could be gained from
the HapMap Project database. Genotypes were determined by using sequence-specific primers in a polymerase chain reaction (SSP-PCR).35 Sequencespecific primers with mismatches at the 30 end were
designed to identify each variant, which, in combination with a consensus primer, produced a product of
known size (primer sequences are available from the
authors on request). Primer concentrations were
titrated to ensure amplification only with exact
matching of the primer with genomic DNA. Briefly, 5
lL of primer mix were added to an 8-lL PCR reaction mixture that contained buffer (67 mM Tris base,
pH 8.8; 16.6 mM ammonium sulfate; 2 mM magnesium chloride; 0.01% volume/volume Tween-20; Bioline Ltd., London, United Kingdom); 200 mM each of
deoxyadenosine triphosphate, deoxythymidine triphosphate, deoxyguanosine triphosphate, and deoxycytidine triphosphate (Bioline Ltd.); 0.32 U of Taq
polymerase (Biotaq; Bioline Ltd.); and from 0.01 to
0.1 lg DNA. This 13-lL reaction was dispensed under

10 lL of mineral oil and amplified in a PCR machine
(MJ Research, Waltham Mass; PTC-200 machine).
Cycling parameters were set as follows: 1 minute at
96 8C; followed by 5 cycles at 96 8C for 25 seconds,
70 8C for 45 seconds, and 72 8C for 45 seconds; followed by 21 cycles at 96 8C for 25 seconds, 65 8C for
50 seconds, and 72 8C for 45 seconds; followed by 4
cycles at 96 8C for 25 seconds, 55 8C for 60 seconds,
and 72 8C for 120 seconds. Then, PCR products were
electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels (Bioline Ltd.)
containing 0.14 mg/mL ethidium bromide (Sigma
Ltd., Poole, United Kingdom), at 200 V/cm2 in 0.5%
Tris borate ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid buffer
(Sigma Ltd.). Products were visualized with an ultraviolet illuminator and photographed with a Polaroid
camera. The presence of an allele-specific band of
the expected size, in conjunction with a control band,
was used to identify an allele. A reaction was considered negative if the control band was visualized without a specific band of the expected size.
Genotype and allele frequencies and allele carriage were calculated and checked for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Interactions between SNPs across
each gene were considered by constructing haplotypes
with the computer programs Phase (http://www.stat.
washington.edu/stephens/software.html) and Arlequin
(http://lgb.unige.ch/arlequin/). Identification of rare
intragene haplotypes can identify genotype errors;
therefore, samples that were identified as having rare
intragene haplotypes were regenotyped to reduce any
errors.36
The database of clinical, laboratory, and genetic
data was analyzed using data mining software,
Knowledge Studio (http://www.angoss.com). The
standard statistical software package Stata (version 8;
http://www.stata.com) was used to test prior hypotheses and any hypotheses generated by the data
mining. Data mining uses decision tree modeling to
examine effects between different variables (including
clinical, laboratory, and genetic variables) by using a
stepwise linear regression approach. Stata was used to
perform the formal statistics for regression analyses.

RESULTS
Clinical data were collected for 228 patients, including 164 controls (responders to morphine) and 64
switchers (required an alternative opioid), as described in detail elsewhere.5 DNA was available for 221
patients. There were no significant differences in age,
sex, ethnicity, or tumor diagnosis between switchers
and controls (Table 1). The majority of patients were
Caucasian (87.3%). For this cohort, switching to an
alternative opioid was successful in 57 of 64

patients (89%): Forty-eight patients required a single
switch (oxycodone), and 9 patients required additional
switch(es) before a good clinical outcome was achieved.
Switchers scored higher for individual morphinerelated side effects compared with controls (Table 2),
as predicted. Stepwise logistic regression with
switch/control as the dependent variable demonstrated that, when pain and side-effect scores were
examined, ‘‘% pain relief’’ was the strongest predictor

hallucinations (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.19–5.05; P 5 .015).
Dry mouth (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.74–11.9; P 5 .01) and
nightmares (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.04–12.25; P 5 .04)
also were retained in the model. Those patients with
moderate or severe side effects (‘‘quite a bit’’ or ‘‘very
much’’ on a 4-point scale) were most likely to switch.
The numbers of patients with moderate or severe
nightmares were small (16 of 228 patients).
Oral morphine doses ranged from 10 mg/24
hours to 1260 mg/24 hours. There was no difference
in the 24-hour dose of morphine between switchers
and controls: Switchers had lower serum morphine
and M3G concentrations with a trend toward lower
M6G concentrations (P 5 .009, P 5 .03, and P 5 .07,
respectively). In agreement with other studies, no
correlation was observed between average pain
scores and analgesic dose, serum morphine or metabolite concentrations per se, or metabolite ratios.
However, ‘‘confusion or hallucinations’’ correlated
with the morphine/M6G ratio (P 5 .05); and, despite
the small numbers of patients experiencing myoclonus (n 5 8), this was associated with 24-hour morphine dose and serum morphine and metabolite
concentrations (P 5 .005, P 5 .009, P 5 .007, and
P 5 .009, respectively).
Assays were developed for 15 putative SNPs in
the COMT gene: Thirteen SNPs spanning a 29-Kb
region were polymorphic in the Caucasian population (Fig. 1; for primer sequences, see Table 3). The
genotype and allele frequencies and the allele carriage for each SNP are tabulated in Table 4. Allele
frequencies for SNPs in intron 1 were significantly different in switchers compared with controls (27370
cytosine [C]/G: chi-square statistic, 3.7 [P 5 .05];
27053G/ adenosine [A]: chi-square statistic, 7.2
[P 5 .007]; 24873A/G: chi-square statistic, 9.1
[P 5 .003). Haplotypes were constructed from the
SNP data for both the Caucasian population and the
total population. In the Caucasian population, the
frequencies of the 2 most common haplotypes were
35% and 23.8%, respectively. Thirteen haplotypes
were present at a frequency of >1% and described
90% of the population (Table 5).
Five SNPs spanning a 96.8-Kb region were genotyped for the MDR-1 gene (for primer sequences, see
Table 6). Four SNPs have been identified as functional variants in other studies, and the other in
intron 7 has a high allele frequency in Caucasians.37,38 The genotype and allele frequencies and
the allele carriage for each SNP are tabulated in
Table 7. Haplotypes were constructed from the SNP
data, and haplotype frequencies agreed closely with

those observed in the Caucasian population studied
by Kroetz et al.38,39 (Table 8). There were no significant differences in allele or haplotype frequencies
when comparing switchers and controls. MDR-1 genotype did not correlate with morphine dose or serum morphine or metabolite levels (data not shown).
The decision to switch opioids is based both on
analgesic response and side-effect profile. Data mining
revealed significant associations between central side
effects (drowsiness, confusion and hallucinations,

nightmares) and genetic variation in MDR-1 and
COMT. No such link was observed with other side
effects, for example, nausea, constipation, and dry
mouth (data not shown). The strongest associations
with central side effects were observed in patients who
had symptoms that were either moderate or severe
and who experienced both drowsiness AND confusion
or hallucinations.

the strongest association with a protective effect
against ‘‘drowsiness and confusion or hallucinations’’
was the SNP in intron 1 24873G (chi-square statistic,
9.1; P < .003), and a strong association also was
observed with haplotype 3 (chi-square statistic, 7.7;
P < .005). The SNPs in the promoter region and those
in intron 1 define this haplotype; the presence of a T
allele at position 215051, thus, shows a significant
but weaker association (chi-square statistic, 4.4; P <

with ‘‘drowsiness AND confusion or hallucinations’’
(chi-square statistic, 4.9; P < .03). There was no correlation between these genotypes and pain (Table 9).
Further analysis confirmed that the genotypes
for MDR-1 and COMT were associated independently with ‘‘drowsiness AND confusion or hallucinations.’’ In each instance, analyses were performed on
the total population and on the Caucasian population alone to ensure that such associations held true
independent of ethnicity. On univariate and multivariate analyses for the Caucasian cohort, both MDR
and COMT were associated significantly with reduction in central side effects (univariate: MDR-1 21/
2677G, P 5 .0003; COMT 24873G, P 5 .003; multivariate: MDR1 21/2677G, P 5 .002; COMT 24871G,

P 5 .003). The percentages of patients with moderate
or severe central side effects who had both, 1, or
neither genetic susceptibility marker(s) are shown in
Figure 2. Patients who had COMT 24873G were less
likely to be drowsy and confused, and having the
common G allele at 21/2677 in MDR-1 also was protective. Thus, the greatest proportion of patients
with drowsiness and confusion was observed among
patients those with the variant A allele at COMT
24873 and a variant T or A allele at 21/2677 in
MDR-1.

DISCUSSION
Patients with cancer often have limited prognoses,
and it is important to achieve adequate pain control
as quickly as possible with minimal side effects.
Therefore, it would be beneficial to be able to individualize opioid therapy to achieve this objective.
The current report provides data on 2 candidate
genes, MDR-1 and COMT, which influence clinical
response to morphine. It is noteworthy that these genotypes independently predict the frequency of morphine-related central side effects, which are the most
common reason for failure to obtain adequate analgesia from morphine, precluding dose escalation. In
total, 18 SNPs were investigated in this study, suggesting a maximum Bonferroni correction of 18.

SNP indicates single nucleotide polymorphism; rs, reference sequence; A, adenosine; T, thymidine; G, guanosine; C, cytidine; Cons, consensus; UTR, untranslated region.
* Position in relation to the ATG start codon (sequence available at: http://snpper.chip.org/bio).

Because of the tight linkage disequilibrium between
many of these SNPs, the correct Bonferroni according to the method of Svejgaard et al.40 is 13. The
results remain significant at a level of P < .05 even if
the maximum correction is applied.

It is clear that the interaction between genetic
factors that influence response to morphine will be
complex. Haplotype analysis has enabled the interactions of multiple SNPs within a gene to be considered. In addition, combining robust clinical data

side effects according to combinations of protective alleles (for the multidrug
resistance 1 gene [MDR1] and the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene [COMT]).
Patients who carried neither protective allele were significantly more likely to
have central side effects (chi-square statistic 5 21.8; P < .0001).

mining techniques to analyze robust clinical and
genetic databases allows an examination of confounding variables in this diverse population (eg, tumor types, time to death).
Our hypothesis based on other studies involving
the COMT gene was that it would be related to the
need to switch, because the need to switch depended
mainly on pain control. In support of this hypothesis,
we observed an association, albeit weak, between

Morphine Side Effects and COMT/MDR-1/Ross et al.

polymorphisms in COMT and the need to switch in
our patients. However, we also observed that,
although pain was the primary reason for switching,
other central side effects, such as confusion, drowsiness, and nightmares, also were important. Therefore, we investigated whether the COMT polymorphism went with switching in those patients who
had pain that was critical or central side effects that
were critical. The results clearly showed that the COMT
polymorphism was related to the central side effects
and not to the pain. It is important to stress at this
point, however, that this is not the same functional
polymorphism that has been described by others
(val158 met). Furthermore, all of our patients had analgesic dose titrated against analgesic effect.
The functional polymorphisms in MDR-1 were
not related to the need to switch. One of these, however, was associated significantly with central side
effects (P 5 .0003). Therefore, COMT and MDR-1 are
associated with central side effects and not with pain
per se. Although the numbers were small, MDR-1
also was linked to a further central side effect: nightmares.
Genetic variation in the COMT gene was associated with central side effects from morphine in this
cohort. However, the known, well studied functional
SNP (Val158Met) was not implicated, and intron 1
was identified as the region of interest. This region is
proximal to the promoter for the soluble form of
COMT and, thus, may be important in regulating
gene expression through alteration of transcription
factor binding sites. When this sequence is used to
interrogate the transcription factor binding program
(http://mbs.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html), the
A allele is conducive with binding of the transcription factors upstream—stimulatory factor, N-myc,
and C-myc. This binding is lost with mutation of the
A allele to G and, thus, may explain a functional
role. Another group also reported a significant association between this SNP, but not with other SNPs
in COMT, with acute postsurgical pain after dental
extraction.41
In addition, in the center of this region is a 4
base-pair tandem repeat. Therefore, we hypothesize
that variation in this region may cause the production of a splice variant of the soluble-COMT protein
and that this variation is in linkage with the neighboring SNPs that were highlighted by the current
study. This hypothesis is supported by the results
from a recent study by Diatchenko et al., who investigated 6 SNPs across the COMT gene. Those authors
correlated combinations of SNPs (haplotypes) with
high, average, and low pain sensitivity in humans to
both experimental pain and the risk of developing a

1401

common musculoskeletal joint pain, temporomandibular joint disorder.31 However, the SNPs that
defined the haplotypes covered intron 2 to exon 4
and did not include intron 1 or the promoter regions.
That study demonstrated a difference in enzyme activity but no difference in mRNA production by comparing low and high pain sensitivity haplotypes.
Therefore, the authors concluded that the likely functional difference would be a problem with translation, ie, abnormal protein production from the
mRNA. This would support the findings of our current study indicating that intron 1 is the functional
region of interest in the COMT gene.
One other pain study has analyzed the influence
of the common functional variant in the COMT
gene, Val158Met, on the efficacy of morphine in a
cohort of patients suffering from cancer-related
pain.32 In that study, morphine doses and serum
concentrations of morphine and morphine metabolites were compared between the genotype groups,
and a weak association was observed between morphine dose and genotype (P 5 .025). That finding
was not confirmed in our similar sized cohort.
Genetic variation in the MDR-1 gene was associated with central side effects to morphine in this
cohort and the SNP in exon 21 (G2677T/A) showed
the strongest association. The drug transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR-1 gene, has a broad
range of substrates, including anticancer drugs and
different opioids. The first study reporting MDR-1related pharmacokinetic data was by Kim et al.,42
who correlated the serum concentrations of the MDR1 substrate fexofenadine with genotype in normal
volunteers and observed a significant association with
both G21/2677TA and C26/3435T SNPs. Siegmund
et al. reported that, for single and multiple doses of
the MDR-1 substrate talinolol, the G21/2677TA SNP,
but not the C26/3435T SNP, was important. Carriers
of the TT/TA variants had elevated areas under the
serum concentration-time curve compared with
those for carriers of at least 1 wild-type G allele. The
T and A variants at this position in exon 21 result in
substitution of an alanine for a serine or threonine,
respectively, at amino acid position 893. Other
groups have confirmed the functional importance of
this SNP.43,44
Alteration in function of the P-glycoprotein
transporter, thus, could alter the relative amounts of
morphine and its glucuronides in the CNS, thereby
influencing the prevalence and severity of morphinerelated central side effects. No differences were observed in serum morphine levels between genotypes,
but this simply may reflect the known poor correlation between serum and CNS levels of morphine.

This study also demonstrated that genetic variation in the MDR-1 gene is independent of and
additive to that of the COMT gene in predicting
morphine-related central side effects. Interaction between the opioid pathway and the noradrenergic and
dopaminergic neurotransmitters, metabolized by
COMT, is well known. Zubieta et al. demonstrated
alteration in neuronal opioid receptor expression in
normal volunteers, depending on COMT genotype.24
Those volunteers also demonstrated variation in their
response to experimental pain with altered neuronal
endogenous opioid production. When exogenous
opioids are given, P-glycoprotein function (ie, MDR-1
genotype) will alter the relative amounts of morphine
and its glucuronides in the CNS. However, this will
have a greater effect if, in addition, the basal expression of opioid receptors is up-regulated (because of
the COMT genotype).
Hence, patients who do not have the protective
allele for MDR-1 may have a poorly functioning Pglycoprotein42–44; therefore, we hypothesis that this
would result in increased CNS levels of morphine for
a given dose. These patients also will have a lower
M6G/morphine ratio, resulting in larger dose requirements for a given analgesic effect; and this, in turn,
may precipitate central side effects. For those
patients with abnormalities of COMT, basal opioid
receptor levels will be altered24; thus, the combination may further precipitate an increase in central
side effects. One case report that involved deletion of
the COMT gene in a patient with velocardiofacial
syndrome reported severe central side effects with
low doses of opioids.45
Further work is needed now to study the 4 basepair tandem repeat in intron 1 of the COMT gene. This
cannot be typed by using SSP-PCR. Although another
group has analyzed this region with microsatellite
analysis,46 preliminary attempts by our group to conduct similar analyses have been unsuccessful to date,
because we have been unable to fully correlate microsatellite and direct sequencing data when patients are
heterozygous for different alleles. Thus, chromosome
separation will be required before genotyping or
sequencing can be performed in this instance.
Understanding the complexity of opioid response
will be an ongoing challenge. Previous work by our
group and others has examined other candidate genes
that may influence response to different opioids.
Although genetic variation in the l-opioid receptor
itself does not correlate with response to morphine,
b-arrestin2, which modulates opioid receptor function, also has been correlated with opioid response.15
Genetic variation in the enzyme-metabolizing morphine has not been correlated with either serum

morphine levels or analgesic response to date15,47;
and other enzymes, such as the cytochrome P450
system, are being evaluated with respect to other
opioids. The current results demonstrate the importance of MDR-1 and COMT genotype in influencing
morphine-related side effects. Individual factors may
influence either sensitivity to pain, or analgesic
response to an opioid, or the frequency of opioidinduced side effects. Therefore, ongoing advances in
both data mining and modeling techniques will be
essential in helping us to combine the strands of information generated to achieve the objective of individualized opioid therapy.
