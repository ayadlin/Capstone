Tumor Response without Functionally Normalizing
the Tumor Vasculature

Abstract
Although antiangiogenic strategies have proven highly promising in preclinical studies and some recent clinical trials,
generally only combinations with cytotoxic therapies have
shown clinical effectiveness. An ongoing question has been
whether conventional therapies are enhanced or compromised by antiangiogenic agents. The present studies were
designed to determine the pathophysiologic consequences
of both single and combined treatments using fractionated
radiotherapy plus AG-013736, a receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor that preferentially inhibits vascular endothelial
growth factor receptors. DU145 human prostate xenograft
tumors were treated with (a) vehicle alone, (b) AG-013736, (c)
5  2 Gy/wk radiotherapy fractions, or (d) the combination.
Automated image processing of immunohistochemical images
was used to determine total and perfused blood vessel spacing, overall hypoxia, pericyte/collagen coverage, proliferation,
and apoptosis. Combination therapy produced an increased
tumor response compared with either monotherapy alone.
Vascular density progressively declined in concert with slightly
increased A-smooth muscle actin–positive pericyte coverage
and increased overall tumor hypoxia (compared with controls). Although functional vessel endothelial apoptosis was
selectively increased, reductions in total and perfused vessels
were generally proportionate, suggesting that functional
vasculature was not specifically targeted by combination
therapy. These results argue against either an AG-013736- or
a combination treatment–induced functional normalization
of the tumor vasculature. Vascular ablation was mirrored by
the increased appearance of dissociated pericytes and empty
type IV collagen sleeves. Despite the progressive decrease
in tumor oxygenation over 3 weeks of treatment, combination therapy remained effective and tumor progression was
minimal. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9921–8]

Introduction
Although antiangiogenic strategies have been shown highly
promising in preclinical studies and some recent phase II and III
clinical trials (1), generally only combinations of antiangiogenic
and cytotoxic therapies have shown clinical effectiveness. As
recently reviewed (2), an ongoing question about such combined
therapies has been whether conventional therapies, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, are enhanced or compromised by anti-

angiogenic agents. Although antiangiogenic strategies might be
expected to destroy tumor vasculature and thereby deprive the
tumor of radiosensitizing oxygen or hinder access to chemotherapeutic agents, results are inconclusive. Some workers have found
decreased tumor oxygenation and blood flow following such agents
(3, 4), whereas others have shown the opposite (5, 6). Concurrent
(4), postradiotherapy (7, 8), and preradiotherapy (9, 10) combination scheduling with antiangiogenics have all been shown advantageous (11).
An intriguing hypothesis recently reviewed by Jain (12) contends
that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors can
selectively prune the chaotic and inefficient vasculature commonly
found in tumors, resulting in a transiently normalized vascular
configuration. This improved vasculature, characterized by reduced
vessel counts and increased coverage of periendothelial support
cells, or pericytes, is thus predicted to more efficiently deliver both
oxygen and drugs. A second often quoted hypothesis is that the
susceptibility of established tumor blood vessels to interference
with VEGF/VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling may be limited
to vessels that lack pericyte coverage (13–15). Recent studies,
however, have noted that pericytes can also be actively recruited
before pruning (6).
The present investigation was designed to evaluate the consequences of combining fractionated radiation with AG-013736, a
potent receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFRs that also
inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) at higher
doses. Does vascular density decrease following 1 to 3 weeks of
single or combination treatment, and if so, does tumor hypoxia
increase or instead decrease in line with vascular normalization?
Given the well-known dependence of radiosensitivity on tumor
oxygen levels, any increase in hypoxia would presumably also
compromise further combination therapy. Our second objective
was to compare alterations in the tightness and coverage of two
pericyte markers and to determine the relation between pericyte
coverage and selective vascular ablation. PDGFRh was selected as
a marker of perivascular progenitors or less mature pericytes (16),
whereas a-smooth muscle actin (a-sma) was chosen to distinguish
more mature pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells (16, 17).
The current findings argue against a functional normalization of
the tumor vasculature following combination therapy. Although
treatment reduced vascular densities, overall tumor hypoxia progressively increased. Despite this decrease in oxygenation, however, combination therapy remained effective and tumor growth
was inhibited.

of NCr nu/nu male mice and grown to tumor volumes of 200 to 400 mm3.
Tumor (including leg) diameters were measured thrice weekly using a
graduated hole template, with opposite nontumor leg diameters subtracted
to calculate actual tumor volumes: tumor volume = p / 6  (tumor leg
diameter3 nontumor leg diameter3). Mice were housed in microisolator
cages and given food and water ad libitum. Guidelines for the humane
treatment of animals were followed as approved by the University
Committee on Animal Resources.
Treatments. AG-013736, a receptor kinase inhibitor of VEGFRs and, at
higher doses, PDGFRs (IC50 = 0.1 nmol/L for VEGFR-1, 0.2 nmol/L for
VEGFR-2, 0.1–0.3 nmol/L for VEGFR-3, and 1.6 nmol/L for PDGFRh; ref. 18),
was provided by Pfizer Global Research and given once daily by gavage in
a volume of 0.13 mL. Control animals received 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose
drug carrier. Irradiations were done on nonanesthetized mice using a 137Cs
source operating at 2.4 Gy/min. Mice were confined to plastic jigs with
tumor-bearing legs extended through an opening in the side, allowing local
irradiations. Fractionated doses were given in five daily 2 Gy fractions per
week (omitting weekends). For combination treatments, radiotherapy was
delivered first, and AG-013736 was given within f4 h. Mice were sacrificed,
and tumors were excised and then quick frozen (using liquid nitrogen)
following 1, 2, or 3 weeks of treatment.
DiOC7 perfusion marker and EF5 hypoxia marker. To visualize blood
vessels open to flow, DiOC7, an intravascular stain that preferentially stains
cells immediately adjacent to the vessels, was injected intravascularly by tail
vein 1 min before freezing (19). Localized areas of tumor hypoxia were
assessed in 9.0-Am frozen sections (one section taken as near as possible to
the tumor center for each combination of stains) by immunohistochemical
identification of sites of 2-nitroimidazole metabolism (20). A pentafluorinated derivative of etanidazole (EF5) was injected intravascularly (0.2 mL
of 10 mmol/L EF5) 1 h before tumor freezing (21) followed by a second dose
45 min later. Regions of high EF5 metabolism were visualized using a Cy3
fluorochrome (Amersham) conjugated to the ELK3-51 antibody, which is
extremely specific for the EF5 adducts that form when the drug is incorporated by hypoxic cells (22). Both the EF5 (made by the National Cancer
Institute) and the ELK3-51 were obtained from the University of
Pennsylvania Imaging Service Center (C. Koch, Director).
Immunohistochemistry and image acquisition. Tumor sections were
imaged using a 10 objective (Olympus BX40 microscope), digitized
(QImaging Retiga 1300C Peltier-cooled, 12-bit digital camera), background
corrected, and image analyzed using Image-Pro software (Media Cybernetics). Twelve-bit gray-scale image montages from 16 adjacent microscope
fields (encompassing a total area of 21.6 mm2) were automatically acquired
and digitally combined for multiple stains (20). First, images of the DiOC7
were obtained immediately after cryosectioning and fixing in cold acetone
for 10 min. Following staining, this section was returned to identical stage
coordinates to obtain images of both EF5/Cy3 and an endothelial cell
marker [MECA-32 (biotinylated primary, 1:100; PharMingen) followed by
incubation with Vectastain ABC Elite Standard kit and AEC detection
(Vector Laboratories)].
Adjacent frozen sections were sliced to visualize combinations of antibodies, generally dual staining of endothelial cells (MECA-32) versus
markers for either (a) proliferation [Ki-67 (MIB-1 clone, mouse anti-human,
1:150; Dako) in conjunction with the M.O.M. ‘‘mouse primary antibody on
mouse tissue’’ kit (Vector Laboratories)], (b) apoptosis [FITC-terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay, DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega), with the following modifications: sections were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin for
10 min after panendothelial cell antigen staining, washed in PBS, and then
incubated for 15 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 before apoptosis staining], (c)
pericytes [PDGFRh, clone APB5, rat anti-mouse, 1:50 (eBioscience) or
a-sma, clone 1A4, mouse Cy3 directly conjugated, 1:1,000 (Sigma)], or (d)
vascular basement membrane (type IV collagen, polyclonal rabbit antimouse, 1:2,000; Chemicon). For Ki-67 and apoptosis, 9-Am sections were
fixed in cold acetone for 10 min, air dried for 10 min, and stored at 80jC.
For pericytes, 20-Am sections were fixed for 10 s in 1% neutral buffered
formalin, washed and covered in PBS, imaged for DiOC7, PBS aspirated,
fixed in room temperature acetone for 1 min, and air dried for 30 min before

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

staining. For type IV collagen, 20-Am sections were fixed in warm acetone
for 1 min and air dried for 30 min. Secondary antibody detection was done
using species-specific Alexa Fluor 488 (type IV collagen) or 546 (Ki-67,
PDGFRh; 1:500; Molecular Probes) combined with MECA-32 using contrasting Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies. Sections were coverslipped with
Slow Fade Gold antifading agent (Molecular Probes).
Image analysis: vascular spacing, apoptosis, and proliferation. As
described previously (23), tumor blood vessel spacing was determined using
a combination of image segmentation and distance map filtering to obtain
a spatial sampling of distance filter intensities, which are directly
proportional to the distribution of distances to the nearest vessel. These
distances (dependent on tumor blood vessel spacing) are reflective of the
median distances over which oxygen and nutrients must diffuse to reach all
cells of the tumor.
Colocalized and thresholded images of MECA-32 endothelial cell
staining, DiOC7, TUNEL, and Ki-67 staining were obtained, and percentage
area was determined for each as well as for the overlap between TUNEL and
perfused vessel staining (using custom Image-Pro macros). Percentage
apoptotic vessel overlap was calculated by dividing the area of vessel
apoptosis overlap by the perfused or total vessel area.
Image analysis: collagen and pericyte coverage and tightness.
Colocalized and thresholded stained images of MECA-32, a-sma, and
PDGFRh were used to obtain percentage areas and overlap between
endothelial and pericyte markers. Percentage coverage was defined as the
percentage area overlap divided by the percentage area endothelial cells,
and percentage dissociation was the percentage pericyte area that did not
overlap endothelial cells. Percentage areas of PDGFRh+ cells, endothelial
cells, and type IV collagen staining were determined using the Image-Pro
percentage area measurement in combination with thresholded images of
positive staining.
Statistical analysis. Treatments were compared using Student’s t test or
the Mann-Whitney rank sum test and considered significant for P V 0.05.

Results
Effects of AG-013736 and/or fractionated radiotherapy on
tumor growth. Mice bearing DU145 tumors were first treated with
10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/d AG-013736 to define a dose that would slow
but not stop tumor growth, thus allowing the later effects of
combination therapies to be recognized. Tumor volumes were
measured thrice weekly, mice were sorted into groups having
roughly equal mean volumes, and treatments were initiated at
volumes between 200 and 400 mm3. Figure 1A presents percentage
tumor volume increase as a function of AG-013736 dose. Tumor
responses following doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg (by gavage) were
roughly equivalent, but 50 mg/kg resulted in substantial inhibition
of tumor growth over the 3 weeks of treatment. A dose of 25 mg/kg
was therefore selected for the combination experiments. Based on
pharmacokinetic data, once daily dosing of AG-013736 at 25 mg/kg
only provided transient (2–4 h per day) inhibition of PDGFRh
(data not shown). Preliminary studies also showed that a schedule
of 5  2 Gy/wk of radiation slowed tumor growth to a rate similar
to that following 25 mg/kg AG-013736 (Fig. 1B).
Mice were next treated for a period of 2 weeks with either
fractionated radiation (5  2 Gy/wk) or AG-013736 (25 mg/kg/d)
and 1 to 3 weeks for the combination. As shown in Fig. 1B, tumor
volume at the end of 2 weeks was significantly reduced for either
single or combination treatments. Percentage increases in tumor
volume were similar between radiotherapy (40 F 9.8%) and AG013736 (48 F 9.2%), and the combination was markedly reduced
versus controls (12 F 5.7% versus 77 F 11%; P < 0.001). A separate
experiment measured combination and control volumes over 3 weeks
of treatment, at which time the percentage increases in tumor
volume were 23.3 F 14% and 211 F 57%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Total and perfused blood vessel spacing increases following
either single or combination treatments. We next examined the
effects of treatment on total and perfused vascular spacing to
gauge whether radiotherapy, AG-013736, or the combination
affected tumor vascular spacing. As shown in Fig. 2A, 2 weeks
of AG-013736, radiotherapy, or the combination significantly
increased both total (black columns) and perfused (white columns)

blood vessel spacing, although none of the three treatments was
significantly different from each other. In this and the following
figures, treated tumors could have been compared with either
day-matched or volume-matched controls. To minimize pathophysiologic variations due to tumor growth alone, our usual approach
is to favor the volume-matched comparisons. Thus, week 1 controls
(mean volumes = 560 F 30 mm3) were chosen for comparison

because they were a fairly close match to all of the week 2 treated
tumor volumes (which ranged from 350 F 30 mm3 for the
combination-treated tumors to 530 F 60 for the AG-013736). It
should be noted, however, that in the case of this relatively slowgrowing DU145 tumor model, vessel spacing and hypoxia did
not change significantly for the control tumors over the range
from 560 to 850 mm3. Figure 2B compares week 1 controls to
combination-treated tumors frozen at 1, 2, or 3 weeks. Although
the combination produced significant increases in total and perfused vessel spacing at most time points in relation to week 1
controls, changes were minimal at week 1, most pronounced at
week 2, and less pronounced by week 3 (which were not
significantly different from week 2 for either total or perfused).
Tumor hypoxia increases following combination therapy.
Overall tumor hypoxia was quantified in frozen sections based on
the intensity of a fluorescently conjugated antibody to EF5.
Perfused spacing increased substantially at week 2 for all three
treatments (Fig. 2A), but hypoxia was unchanged for the
radiotherapy (P = 0.29) and increased only minimally for either
AG-013736 (P = 0.011) or the combination (P = 0.033), which were
no different from each other (P = 0.35). Overall hypoxia increased
slightly at weeks 1 and 2 in combination-treated tumors (P = 0.004
and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2D) and substantially at week 3
(P < 0.001). Thus, although tumor volumes remained essentially
constant following combination therapy, vascular functionality
steadily decreased with an ultimate increase in tumor hypoxia.

Although alterations in hypoxia might be expected to parallel
changes in perfused vessel spacing, this was not always the case.
For instance, perfused vessel spacing increased substantially between weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, whereas overall tumor hypoxia
remained constant. At week 3, perfused spacing was not significantly different from weeks 1 or 2 (P = 0.063), but hypoxia
markedly increased (P = 0.003). As has been shown previously
using direct measures of tumor microvessel HbO2 saturations (24),
vessels defined as ‘‘perfused’’ can vary markedly in terms of their
functionality. Thus, the constant levels of perfused vessel spacing
over the 3 weeks of treatment may correspond to a progressive
decrease in functionality with continued treatment, leading to the
observed increase in hypoxia. We therefore consider the EF5 intensities as the more rigorous assay for changes in overall tumor
hypoxia following treatment. This index is incapable of distinguishing between clonogenic and nonclonogenic tumor cell subpopulations, however, which can only be definitively defined using survival
or clonogenic assays of ‘‘radiobiological hypoxic fraction’’ (25).
Combination therapy increases perfused vessel endothelial
apoptosis and reduces tumor cell proliferation. Based on
TUNEL staining, neither overall tumor cell apoptotic density nor
endothelial cell apoptosis was significantly increased by either
single or combination treatments (data not shown). Apoptosis
of perfused vessel endothelial cells (Fig. 3A and B) increased
significantly for combination-treated tumors at weeks 2 and 3
(P = 0.03 versus 0.097 for radiotherapy alone and 0.201 for

AG-013736 alone). This could reflect increased drug and oxygen
concentrations within the vessels, assuming that these vessels were
also perfused at time of treatment. No significant differences were
noted between combination treatments and either radiotherapy
or AG-013736 alone (P = 0.22 or 0.66, respectively). Finally, based
on percentage positive Ki-67 staining, tumor cell proliferation was
significantly increased by radiotherapy at 2 weeks after therapy
(Fig. 3C) but decreased by the combination at both 2 and 3 weeks
(Fig. 3D). Again, the combination was not significantly different
from AG-013736 alone.
PDGFRB+ pericyte dissociation, but not coverage, is increased by combination treatment. PDGFRh+ is generally
believed to mark a progenitor population of pericytes, whereas
a-sma+ denotes more mature cells (16). Figure 4 presents effects of
treatment on (a) percentage PDGFRh+ coverage (i.e., the fraction of
blood vessel area covered by PDGFRh+ pericytes) and (b)
percentage dissociation (the fraction of PDGFRh+ pericyte area
not overlapping blood vessels). In the current study, vascular
coverage of PDGFRh+ pericytes was f75% in controls and was not
significantly altered by single or combined treatments (Fig. 4A and
B, yellow columns). Dissociation of PDGFRh+ pericytes, however,
increased progressively for radiotherapy, AG-013736, and the combination (Fig. 4C) and remained elevated throughout the 3 weeks
of combination therapy (Fig. 4D). Dissociation in the combination tumors was significantly higher than for the AG-013736
(P = 0.014), which in turn was significantly higher than for the
radiotherapy (P = 0.038). Interestingly, dissociation in response to
the combination peaked at week 2, which corresponds to the peak
in vascular spacing (Fig. 2B) and suggests a possible link between
vascular ablation and pericyte dissociation. Representative pseudocolor images of tumors dual stained for endothelial cells and both
PDGFR+ and a-sma+ pericytes are shown in Fig. 4E.
A-sma+ pericyte dissociation and coverage are increased by
combination treatment. Coverage of a-sma+ pericytes was
substantially lower than for PDGFRh+ pericytes in untreated tumor
vessels (f20% versus f75%) but increased following both
radiotherapy or the combination and remained elevated throughout 3 weeks of therapy (Fig. 4A and B, blue columns). This suggests
either (a) selective ablation of non-a-sma+ pericyte-coated blood
vessels or (b) recruitment of a-sma+ pericytes to previously noncoated vessels. Because vessel numbers were also substantially
decreased at these times, selective ablation seems the more likely
mechanism after week 1 of combination therapy. At weeks 2 to 3,
however, vessel counts were further reduced in the absence of
increased a-sma+ coverage (Fig. 4B, blue columns), suggesting that
vessels are then similarly targeted irrespective of pericyte coverage.
As with PDGFh+ cells, dissociation of a-sma+ cells increased significantly with both mono and combined therapies and progressively increased with increasing weeks of combination therapy
(Fig. 4C and D, blue columns).
Type IV collagen–coated basement membranes are retained
following endothelial ablation. Figure 5 illustrates changes in
percentage areas of endothelial cells, PDGFRh+ pericytes, a-sma+
pericytes, and type IV collagen (used to identify vascular basement
membranes) following combination treatment. As expected based
on the increased vascular spacing results of Fig. 2B, percentage
area of endothelial cells decreased significantly in relation to
controls at each time point (P < 0.001 in each case). In contrast,
no significant changes were seen for type IV collagen, a-sma, or
PDGFRh percentage areas. This suggests that the net effect of the
combination therapy was to ablate the endothelial cell layer of the

www.aacrjournals.org

blood vessels while retaining the basement membrane sleeve and
perivascular cells, as has been previously reported following AG013736 alone (26). In control tumors, dual staining revealed
extensive overlap between type IV collagen+ basement membrane
and endothelial cell staining (Fig. 5B, yellow), although small
subregions with high proportions of disassociated collagen sleeves
were also sometimes present. For combination-treated tumors, in
contrast, vascular counts were substantially reduced and empty
collagen sleeves were broadly distributed throughout the tumor
cross-section (Fig. 5C). Finally, overlap between PDGFRh+ and
collagen was also substantially reduced following combination
therapy (compare Fig. 5D and E), suggesting that treatment results
in the dissociation of basement membrane sleeves from pericytes
as well as endothelial cells.

Discussion
The current studies are the first to treat tumors with a combination of fractionated radiotherapy plus AG-013736, a receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of primarily VEGFRs at the dose levels used
in this study. This combination resulted in a significantly reduced
tumor growth rate in comparison with either monotherapy alone.
For the combination-treated tumors, tumor vascular density significantly decreased and hypoxia progressively increased compared
with controls but was not significantly different from either radiotherapy or AG-013736 at the week 2 time point. Functional vessel
endothelial cell apoptosis was also increased by the combination. However, differences with respect to either monotherapy were
again minimal. Because alterations in total and perfused vessel
spacings were generally proportionate, functional vasculature was
likely not selectively targeted by the combination therapy.
Previous work has suggested that VEGFR-2 inhibitors alone can
lead to vascular normalization, which has been defined as a combination of selective pruning of excess tumor vessels, an increase
in pericyte coverage, and a transient improvement in tumor
oxygenation (6, 27). In agreement with the current results, however,
alternate studies have shown short-term and long-term impairment of vascular function and increased tumor hypoxia following
VEGFR-2 inhibition (3). As summarized in recent reviews (11, 28),
combinations of radiotherapy with antiangiogenic strategies have
almost universally shown increased tumor growth delay when
compared with radiotherapy alone. Because neither irradiated nor
unirradiated tumor cells are usually affected by antiangiogenic
compounds in vitro (11), this suggests a radiosensitizing effect that
is either restricted to the endothelial cells, related to alterations
in tumor blood flow, or both. Endothelial sensitization is supported
by the work of Schueneman et al. (29), who administered daily
radiotherapy after SU11248, a similar multitargeted small-molecule
inhibitor of VEGFRs and PDGFRs, and found that the combination reduced tumor blood flow but increased endothelial-specific
apoptosis and vascular destruction. SU11657, another inhibitor
of VEGFRs and PDGFRs, was most effective when single-dose
radiotherapy was delivered 1 day after the drug. At that time, tumor
interstitial pressures were substantially reduced and tumor blood
flow was presumably increased (9).
As a rule, pericytes are believed to form tighter associations with
endothelial cells in normal tissue compared with tumors (17, 30).
However, the literature has been somewhat conflicted in defining
optimal antibodies for identification of pericyte maturity. A major
obstacle is the variability in marker expression and coverage
among different tumor models (13, 17, 31), although elegant studies

have convincingly shown that PDGFRh+ cells are a progenitor of
a-sma+ perivascular cells (16) and that vessels covered by more
mature a-sma+ pericytes are selectively protected in tumors subjected to VEGF withdrawal (13). Previous work has also suggested
that pericyte coverage does not generally increase following radiotherapy alone (32) and can either increase (6) or decrease (16)
following antiangiogenic strategies. Although pericytes can confer
resistance to a variety of VEGFR-targeting agents, the inclusion
of specific PDFGR inhibitors has been shown to overcome this
resistance, leading to vessel destabilization and regression (15).

Recent work suggests that the effects of AG-013736 are most likely
predominantly due to VEGFR rather than PDGFRh inhibition (26).
In spontaneous pancreatic tumors, AG-013736 was shown to produce a tightening of a-sma+ pericyte coverage combined with a loss
of both pericyte-coated and pericyte-free vessels (30). Vascular area
was found to decrease by 79%, but a-sma+ pericyte area was only
reduced 33%, suggesting a preferential targeting of non-a-sma+
vessels. PDGFRh+ pericytes were unchanged following administration or withdrawal of AG-013736, and vessels that survived treatment were generally perfused.

Combined Therapy with AG-013736 and Radiation

Figure 5. A, comparison of the effects of 1 to 3 wk of combination treatment
(2 Gy radiotherapy plus 25 mg/kg AG-013736 per day) on % area of total
vessels (MECA-32), pericytes (PDGFRh+ and a-sma+), and vascular basement
membranes (type IV collagen). Only total vessel % area changed significantly
with treatment. Columns, mean; bars, SE. *, significant differences of treated
tumors compared with week 1 controls (P < 0.001 for each). B and C,
pseudocolored, dual-stained images of type IV collagen (red), MECA-32
endothelial marker (green ), and overlap (yellow ). Bar, 100 Am. B, week 1 control
tumor showing predominant overlap (yellow ) between type IV collagen (red)
and endothelial cells (green ). C, week 3 combination-treated tumor showing
reduced vascular counts and a high proportion of basement membrane sleeves.
D and E, pseudocolored, dual-stained images of type IV collagen (red),
PDGFRh+ (blue ), and overlap (magenta ). D, week 1 control tumor showing
extensive overlap (magenta ) between collagen (red) and PDGFRh+ (blue ).
E, week 3 combination-treated tumor showing increase in dissociation of
PDGFRh+ cells from type IV collagen (red ).

This contrasts somewhat with current findings in which
perfused and nonperfused vessels were nonselectively ablated by
combination treatments. However, we did observe an initial
increase in a-sma+ coverage, combined with increased dissociation
of both a-sma+ and PDGFRh+ pericytes. This supports a selective
ablation of non–a-sma+-coated vessels rather than a recruitment
of a-sma+ pericytes because vascular counts also substantially
decreased. This selectivity was lost by week 2 of treatment,

however, and further vascular reductions were not mirrored by
corresponding alterations in pericyte coverage. Instead, a significant
dissociation of both a-sma+ and PDGFRh+ pericytes was observed
following either AG-013736 or the combination.
Recent studies have also suggested that basement membrane
sleeves are retained following endothelial destruction and can later
provide a scaffolding for rapid vascular regrowth following
cessation of VEGF inhibition (26). We found a similar dissociation
of type IV collagen vascular sleeves from endothelial cells as well as
from PDGFRh+ pericytes following combination therapy. Interestingly, the timing of increases in PDGFRh dissociation precisely
paralleled the temporal reductions in vessel counts following both
single and combined therapies. Together, these data suggest that
the net effect of the combination treatment is to selectively destroy
endothelial cells while at the same time stripping pericytes from
their associated basement membranes.
In the current experimental design, combination therapy was
scheduled such that AG-013736 was delivered after radiotherapy
under the assumption that pretreatment with the antiangiogenic
agent would reduce tumor perfusion and thereby compromise
radiotherapy (8). AG-013736 could alternatively have been administered just before radiotherapy, however, which would presumably
further accentuate endothelial apoptosis and sensitization of
endothelial cells to radiotherapy. Although previous studies have
reported increased endothelial and tumor cell apoptosis immediately following radiotherapy, both return to baseline levels by 1 and
2 weeks (32). Our weekly time points could conceivably have
missed transient changes, which illustrates the importance of
including multiple time points.
In conclusion, the current findings argue against a treatmentinduced functional normalization of the tumor vasculature when
applying combination therapy. Rather than tightening pericytes,
AG-013736 and the combination treatment served instead to
loosen pericyte-vessel and pericyte-basement membrane associations in this tumor model. Treatment substantially reduced total
and functional vascular densities, but overall tumor hypoxia
progressively increased, in contrast to the normalization hypothesis. Despite the reduction in oxygenation, tumor progression was
minimal over 3 weeks of combination treatment, most likely due to
continued vascular destruction and the prevention of new vessel
growth. Further studies are essential to extend these measurements
to additional tumor models and to determine whether alternative
scheduling may also enhance treatment response.
