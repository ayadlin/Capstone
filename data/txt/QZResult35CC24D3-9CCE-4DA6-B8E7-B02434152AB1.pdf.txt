Abstract
Ruxolitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the JAK kinases,
which has been approved for the treatment of myeloﬁbrosis, a
rare myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), but clinical trials
are also being conducted in inﬂammatory-driven solid
tumors. Increased infection rates have been reported in ruxolitinib-treated patients, and natural killer (NK) cells are
immune effector cells known to eliminate both virus-infected
and malignant cells. On this basis, we sought to compare
the effects of JAK inhibition on human NK cells in a cohort
of 28 MPN patients with or without ruxolitinib treatment
and 24 healthy individuals. NK cell analyses included cell
frequency, receptor expression, proliferation, immune synapse formation, and cytokine signaling. We found a reduction
in NK cell numbers in ruxolitinib-treated patients that was

linked to the appearance of clinically relevant infections. This
reduction was likely due to impaired maturation of NK
cells, as reﬂected by an increased ratio in immature to mature
NK cells. Notably, the endogenous functional defect of NK
cells in MPN was further aggravated by ruxolitinib treatment. In vitro data paralleled these in vivo results, showing
a reduction in cytokine-induced NK cell activation. Further,
reduced killing activity was associated with an impaired
capacity to form lytic synapses with NK target cells. Taken
together, our ﬁndings offer compelling evidence that ruxolitinib impairs NK cell function in MPN patients, offering an
explanation for increased infection rates and possible longterm side effects associated with ruxolitinib treatment. Cancer

Introduction

in the JAK2 protein, mediating constitutive activation of the
JAK/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)
pathway (3). Ruxolitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor already
approved for the treatment of myeloﬁbrosis and polycythemia
vera. Although ruxolitinib is supposed to be not curative, it
leads to reduction of increased blood counts and an excellent
symptom control linked to a substantial reduction of proinﬂammatory mediators and reduction of spleen size (4, 5). The
observation that the therapeutic effects are irrespective of the
patients' JAK mutational status and that the compound induces
only limited anticlonal activity (6) suggests that it profoundly
modiﬁes the inﬂammatory microenvironment. The idea that
JAK inhibitors are immunosuppressive is underscored by an
increased infection rate of patients treated with ruxolitinib
(7–11), but also by its potential beneﬁt in inﬂammatory-driven
cancers, such as pancreatic cancer with increased C-reactive
protein levels (12). In line with these clinical observations, we
recently provided evidence that JAK inhibitors markedly impair
dendritic cell biology (13).
Natural killer (NK) cells are another innate immune effector
cell population recognizing and killing malignant or virusinfected cells (14). NK cell function has to be tightly regulated
by a complex balance between various activating and inhibitory
NK cell receptors (15). Moreover, cytokine signals mediated
via the JAK/STAT pathway are key determinants for NK cell
activation (16).
The role of NK cells in Philadelphia-negative MPNs is
poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this article was to

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are clonal bone marrow stem cell disorders in which the proliferation of an abnormal clone of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow results in hypercellular bone marrow, but may also lead to
severe ﬁbrosis in myeloﬁbrosis (1). Janus kinases (JAK) are
tyrosine kinases playing an important role in the transduction
of cytokine signals (2). Almost all of the polycythemia vera and
approximately half of the myeloﬁbrosis patients harbor a gainof-function mutation that results in a V617F amino acid change

characterize NK cells in MPN patients and to deﬁne the
impact of JAK inhibition on NK cell activation. The data may
help to better understand therapeutic but also potential side
effects of JAK inhibitors in MPN as well as in other cancer
patients.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples
Blood was taken from 28 MPN patients and 24 healthy
donors. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Relevant
infections were deﬁned according to the CTCAE4.0 grading
system as grade 2 (i.e., requiring systemic treatment with
antivirals, antibiotics, and/or antifungals). Our study was
approved by the local ethical committees (No. 154/13 for
Bonn; EK127/12 for Aachen; No. 3462 for D€
usseldorf) and
was performed according to the declaration of Helsinki. Buffy
coats were obtained from healthy blood donors (University
Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany). NK cells were isolated by
magnetic bead separation (NK Cell Enrichment Kit; StemCell
Technologies), and purity (>95%) was routinely checked by
ﬂow cytometry.
Cell culture
The K562 target cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (both from Life Technologies) and 10%
FBS (Biochrom). K562 (kindly provided by Bettina Langhans,
University Clinic Bonn, 2012) were regularly tested for MHC class
I absence. The NK cell line NK-92 (kindly provided by Helmut
Salih, University Clinic T€
ubingen, Germany, 2012) was cultured
in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium alpha (MEM-a) containing 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 U/mL recombinant IL2 (Proleukin, Novartis). Expression of NK markers as
well as functional capacity was regularly tested by ﬂow cytometry.
All cell lines were tested for Mycoplasma monthly (MycoAlert,
Mycoplasma detection Kit Lonza).

Functional NK cell assays
For in vitro experiments, freshly isolated NK cells were
cultivated overnight with 1000 U/mL IL2 and increasing
concentrations of ruxolitinib (dissolved in DMSO, Selleckchem, Houston, TX). Alternatively, NK cells were activated via
NKp46 (Biolegend) cross-linked by plate-bound goat antimouse IgG (Dianova). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) or NK cells isolated from MPN patients and healthy
controls were used for ex vivo functional analysis. Functional
assays were performed as described before (17, 18). Brieﬂy,
NK cells were cocultured for 4 to 6 hours with K562 at the
indicated ratios. IFNg production was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining and subsequent ﬂow cytometry 6 hours
after stimulation with IL12/IL18 (Immunotools/Biozol) and
Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). For synapse formation assays,
CellTrace Violet-labeled NK-92 and CellTrace Far Red–stained
K562 cells (Life Technologies) were cocultured at the indicated effector-to-target ratios.

Flow cytometry
For ﬂow cytometry, CD3-FITC, CD3-APC, CD56-PE, CD56-PEVio770, NKG2D-PE, NKp46-APC, CD16-APC-Vio770, CD158a/
h-Vioblue, CD158b-APC, CD158e-PerCP (all from Miltenyi Biotec), CD107a-FITC, CD69-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD8APC-Alexa750, CD27-PECy7, CD161-APC, CD57-APC, CD11bBv421 (Biolegend), and CD159-PE (Beckman Coulter) were used.
Intracellular staining was performed using IFNg-FITC, Granzyme
B-FITC, Perforin-Vioblue (Miltenyi Biotec) with Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm (Biolegend).
Phosphoﬂow cytometry was performed as described previously (19). In brief, IL2-stimulated NK cells exposed to
increasing concentrations of ruxolitinib were ﬁxed with PFA
and subsequently barcoded with Paciﬁc Blue Succinimidyl
Ester (Life Technologies). Phosphorylation of targeted proteins such as S6, STAT5, and ERK (BD Biosciences and Cell
Signaling Technology) were analyzed. All ﬂow cytometry

Phalloidin-TRITC (50 mg/mL; Sigma Aldrich) for analyzing ﬁlamentous actin. The slides were examined at room
temperature using the microscope and camera model Olympus Fluoview 1000 Confocal LSM with PlanS Apo60/NA
1.35, oil immersion. Images were processed with Adobe
Photoshop.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
Software. If more than two groups were compared, ANOVA with
subsequently the Tukey multiple comparison test was performed,
whereas when two groups were compared, the Mann–Whitney U
test was applied. Values for P less than 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant. Correlation was calculated with the Pearson/Spearman test.

Results
Ruxolitinib reduces NK cell levels in MPN patients
First, NK cell frequency from patients with myeloﬁbrosis or
polycythemia vera was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (for
detailed patient characteristics, see Table 1). In ruxolitinibna€ve patients, mean NK cell frequency (12.63% 1.81%) was
comparable with young (13.51% 1.44%) as well as to agematched healthy donors (12.58% 1.77%). In contrast,
patients treated with ruxolitinib have clearly reduced levels
of NK cells (5.47% 1.27%; Fig. 1A and B, top). The difference between absolute NK cell numbers of MPN patients
with and without ruxolitinib is not highly signiﬁcant
(P < 0.01), due to the fact that two patients received ruxolitinib
only for 2 months. We also provide clear evidence that
the reduction of NK cells develops over time (Fig. 1B, bottom;
P < 0.001 for relative and absolute NK cell quantiﬁcation). If
we focus only on patients having received ruxolitinib for at
least 3 months, the difference between MPNs with and without the drug was highly statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.0005;
data not shown).
To evaluate a potential clinical implication, patients under
ruxolitinib were classiﬁed in two groups: Patients with and
without relevant infections (i.e., grade 2) according to
CTCAE4.0. Interestingly, 56% of our patients receiving ruxolitinib
developed relevant infections, whereas only 16% of patients
without ruxolitinib treatment did so (see Table 1). More importantly, the NK cell frequency is linked to the appearance of
infections, as patients with relevant infections during ruxolitinib
therapy had a signiﬁcantly lower NK cell percentage and absolute
NK cell counts than those patients without relevant infections
(Fig. 1C). Of the total infected patients with ruxolitinib treatment,
approximately two third (66%) experienced viral infections
(including herpes zoster).

To follow the time-dependent impact of ruxolitinib within
individual patients, two patients (MPN 8 and 9) could be sequentially analyzed, and the drop of NK cells during ruxolitinib after 3
months could be clearly seen. Another patient (MPN 4) had to
stop ruxolitinib therapy due to an adverse event. In this individual, NK cell levels rose back to normal values, indicating that the
NK cell drop was ruxolitinib dependent and is potentially reversible (Fig. 1D).
We next evaluated whether ruxolitinib affects the CD56dim
and CD56bright NK cell distribution (mirroring different
functional characteristics: CD56bright predominantly produce
cytokines, and CD56dim NK cells are cytotoxic). In both
healthy donor groups (young and age-matched), the ratio
of CD56bright:CD56dim NK cells was approximately 0.1. In
MPN patients without ruxolitinib therapy, the CD56bright:
CD56dim ratio is increased, as the frequency of CD56bright
NK cells is almost doubled when compared with healthy
(age-matched) donors. The ratio in ruxolitinib-treated
patients is comparable with the level seen in healthy agematched controls.
MPN patients have an endogenous defect in NK cell function
that is further aggravated by JAK inhibition
The function of NK cells in MPN patients was analyzed by
CD107 expression and a classical killing assay. Degranulation
and killing were signiﬁcantly lower in MPN patients than in
healthy controls (Fig. 2A). In healthy donors, no strong agedependent reduction in the functional capacity of NK cells can
be observed (20). If we compare NK cells from healthy donors
to MPN patients with and without ruxolitinib, the functional
activity of NK cells isolated from MPN patients is clearly
reduced (Fig. 2A). The use of highly puriﬁed NK cells, instead
of PBMCs, showed that the difference between the patients
with/without ruxolitinib is probably mainly a consequence of
the difference in NK cell numbers. The few remaining NK cells
isolated from ruxolitinib-exposed patients show only a slight
functional impairment when compared with NK cells from
ruxolitinib-na€ve patients (Fig. 2B).
We next phenotypically characterized NK cells from ruxolitinib-na€ve versus ruxolitinib-exposed patients and compared
them with normal NK cells from young as well as from agematched healthy donors. Ruxolitinib-treated patients had a
clear reduction of the activation marker granzyme B when
compared with MPN patients without treatment and both
healthy control groups (Fig. 2C). In aged donors (i.e., agematched controls and untreated MPN patients), the number of
NKp46-, NKG2D-, and perforin-expressing NK cells was
reduced. Interestingly, treatment with ruxolitinib leads to a
further reduction of the activating receptors NKp46 and
NKG2D even when compared with age-matched controls
(Fig. 2C). NKp46 and NKG2D expression in CD56dim and

(Continued.) Killing activity was evaluated by quantifying cells that were double positive for CFSE and propidium iodide. B, highly puriﬁed NK cells of MPN
patients without ruxolitinib (n ¼ 10) and MPN patients with ruxolitinib (n ¼ 10) were cultured and analyzed as in A (  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001). C,
receptor frequency of ﬁve different NK cell receptors was determined on gated NK cells from healthy donors (n ¼ 22), age-matched healthy donors (n ¼ 12),
patients with myeloﬁbrosis without ruxolitinib (n ¼ 12), and patients with myeloﬁbrosis (n ¼ 16) receiving ruxolitinib treatment. The individual patient
data are shown, as well as a line representing the mean ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001). D, representative histograms show proliferation

Ruxolitinib Impairs NK Cell Function

CD56bright NK cells was not statistically different (data not
shown). Similar to reduced killing activity of primary NK cells
from MPN patients, proliferation was reduced when compared
with healthy controls, even though analysis of NK cell proliferation was technically challenging due to the very low number
of NK cells (Fig. 2D).
Reduced NK cell frequency in ruxolitinib-treated MPN patients
is caused by impaired NK cell maturation
The majority of NK cells in healthy donors are double
positive for NKp46 and NKG2D. Although age-matched controls already exhibit reduced levels of double-positive NK
cells, the population is further reduced in ruxolitinib-treated
patients, whereas double-negative NK cells are increased
(Fig. 3A). Double-negative cells may reﬂect an increased frequency of probably functionally immature NK cells. Therefore,
we analyzed NK cell maturation stages in more detail, by
staining for CD27/CD11b expression, allowing the deﬁnition
of the different NK cell maturation stages (21, 22). The frequency of mature NK cells (CD11bþCD27) is slightly reduced
in MPN patients without ruxolitinib but is signiﬁcantly lower in
patients with ruxolitinib treatment than in age-matched
healthy donors (Fig. 3B). Next, we used KIR and NKG2A
expression to classify NK cells into four maturation stages
(23). Strikingly, only MPN patients exposed to ruxolitinib had
a signiﬁcantly higher frequency of NK cells lacking expression
of NKG2A and KIR (NKG2AKIR; Fig. 3C). The NKG2AKIR
subset represents an immature NK cell differentiation stage
linked to functional hyporesponsiveness (24). In summary,
ruxolitinib seems to induce a NK maturation block, reﬂected
by the increased frequency of immature and decreased abundance of mature NK cells.
The reduced frequency of NKp46þNKG2Dþ NK cells may,
at least in part, be due to increased expression levels of their
ligands on the MPN clone. As it is difﬁcult to speciﬁcally gate
on the MPN clone by ﬂow cytometry (due to a lack of an
unambiguous marker), we analyzed NKp46 and NKG2D
ligands in patients and healthy controls using fusion protein
binding to gated CD33þ myeloid cells. Using this approach,
we were not able to detect an altered expression of the ligands
in MPN patients with and without ruxolitinib therapy. However, compared with CD33þ-gated cells from healthy controls, MPN patients expressed higher levels of NKG2D ligand
in the myeloid compartment, whereas NKp46 expression was
only marginally increased (data not shown).
Ruxolitinib impairs NK cell function in vitro
Because the analysis of NK cells from MPN patients is
limited due to low NK cell numbers, we next evaluated the
impact of ruxolitinib on NK cells in vitro. Therefore, we used
drug concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mmol/L, which are
comparable with the in vivo peak concentrations achieved in

humans (1–2 mmol/L; ref. 25). Ruxolitinib dose dependently
reduced NK cell killing activity, which was paralleled by a
reduced CD107 mobilization (Fig. 4A, top). Stimulation of NK
cells with IL12/IL18 to induce IFNg secretion was also dose
dependently reduced by JAK inhibition (Fig. 4A, bottom).
In contrast, JAK-independent activation via cross-linked
NKp46 was not affected by ruxolitinib (Fig. 4A, bottom). In
line with the patient's data, where we could detect further
suppression of NK cell function by ruxolitinib, we provide
clear evidence that cytokine production and killing of target
cells are dose dependently impaired by ruxolitinib. Similar to
reduced degranulation and cytokine production, proliferation
of NK cells is also dose dependently inhibited by ruxolitinib
(Fig. 4B).
Ruxolitinib prevents upregulation of activation markers
A detailed phenotypic analysis of NK cells was performed
to determine the effect of ruxolitinib on the NK cell activation process. Interestingly, in contrast with the decreased
frequency in patients NK cells, our in vitro ﬁndings using NK
cells from healthy controls show a predominant effect of
ruxolitinib on the expression levels of activating NK cell
markers [reﬂected by mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI)
reduction]. The known activation-dependent shift of NK
cells to the CD56bright population is inhibited by ruxolitinib
(Fig. 4C). Similarly, JAK inhibition prevented cytokineinduced upregulation of CD16, granzyme B, as well as
induction of the activating NK receptors NKp46, NKG2D,
and CD69 (Fig. 4C).
Moreover, as we showed that after ruxolitinib removal, the
reduced NK cell frequency in patients is potentially reversible,
we next investigated the potential reversibility of the ruxolitinib effects on healthy NK cells, or if restimulated NK cells
after ruxolitinib exposure become even hyperinﬂammatory
like in patients (26). Remarkably, the diminishing effects of
JAK inhibition on NK cell function in vitro are almost
completely reversible, as the cytotoxic potential of previously
drug-exposed NK cells against K562 cells was restored to levels
seen in solvent-exposed NK cells (Fig. 4D). This also supports
our data that ruxolitinib doses up to 10 mmol/L do not induce
cell death in NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Ruxolitinib impairs synapse formation and inhibits the JAK/
STAT signaling pathway
Knowing that ruxolitinib affects NK cell cytotoxic activity in
vitro and in vivo, we next addressed whether impaired lytic
synapse formation potentially explains the reduced killing.
Confocal microscopy helps to visualize the interaction between
NK-92 effector and K562 target cells (Fig. 5A) and shows a clear
reduction of effector-to-target cell interactions. To quantify the
observed reduction in lytic synapse formation, doublet formation of differentially labelled NK-92 and K562 cells was

Ruxolitinib Impairs NK Cell Function

analyzed by means of a ﬂow cytometry–based assay (representative staining shown in Fig. 5B). Indeed, ruxolitinib dose
dependently impaired stable physical interaction between NK
and K562 cells (Fig. 5C).
Finally, we investigated potentially affected phosphorylation
levels of proteins integrating cytokine signals. We primarily
focused on downstream signaling components of the JAK pathway using phosphoﬂow technology. Compared with the IgG
control, the signals of pS6, pSTAT5, and (less intense) pERK were
upregulated by cytokine stimulation in control samples exposed
to solvent, whereas ruxolitinib induced a dose-dependent
decrease of IL2-induced S6 and STAT5 but not of ERK phosphorylation in primary human NK cells (Fig. 5D and E). Of note,
phosphorylation levels of the primary target kinases JAK1 and
JAK3, which both are relevant for NK cell function, were not
affected by ruxolitinib as proven by Western blot (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study that provides a detailed analysis of the
inﬂuence of ruxolitinib on NK cell biology in MPN patients.
We show that ruxolitinib impairs the NK cell compartment
both in vitro and in MPN patients. Ruxolitinib drastically
reduces NK cell numbers in ruxolitinib-treated patients when
compared with drug-na€ve individuals. Importantly, we provide evidence that patients with low NK cell numbers during
ruxolitinib exposure also have a higher rate of clinically
relevant infections. Of note, the majority of infections were
of viral origin, which are known to be governed by a functional
NK cell compartment. Reduced NK cell numbers in ruxolitinib-exposed patients may, at least in part, be due to defective
NK cell maturation, explaining the time-dependent decrease
of NK cell numbers during ruxolitinib intake. Insufﬁcient
NK cell renewal is reﬂected by an increased ratio of phenotypically immature to mature NK cells. It is known that NK cell
maturation critically depends on appropriate cytokine signals
(27, 28), especially IL2/IL15. NK cell precursors lacking
IL15Rb also show an NK cell differentiation defect leading to
severe immunodeﬁciency (29). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that ruxolitinib interferes with cytokine signals required
for terminal maturation of NK cells, explaining the shift to an
immature NK cell phenotype. Moreover, IL15R integrates
signals via its common g-chain in committed NK cell precursors and drives differentiation from immature to mature NK
cells, as well as IL15 supports mature NK cell survival (30–32).
Thus, it is almost impossible to deﬁne in detail at the patient
level at which differentiation stage ruxolitinib interferes with
NK cell differentiation, but probably most of them are affected. Mutations in JAK3 (33) and/or STAT5B (34) also cause a
severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) syndrome in
humans, characterized by very low numbers or absence of
NK cells, further supporting the critical importance of an
active JAK/STAT pathway for proper NK cell differentiation.
Whereas data suggest that JAK3 is central for IL2/15-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (35), ruxolitinib has been
described to be a predominant inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2
(36). However, it has also recently been demonstrated that
ruxolitinib also affects other tyrosine kinases, such as JAK3
and Tyk2 (37), thus potentially explaining defective NK cell
maturation in ruxolitinib-treated MPN patients. On a signal-

www.aacrjournals.org

ing basis, we could conﬁrm this idea by showing that ruxolitinib strongly prevented cytokine-induced STAT5 phosphorylation, which is a well-known downstream target of JAK
activation. Of note, the IL2-induced phosphorylation of
JAK1 and JAK3 is not signiﬁcantly affected, which is supported
by previous data showing that ruxolitinib may even (despite
potent inhibition of the kinase activity) induce hyperphopshorylation of JAK2 (38).
Thus, we suggest that ruxolitinib inhibits mainly the JAK3/
STAT5 pathway downstream of the IL2/IL15 receptors, which
is critical for both NK activation and differentiation. We
cannot completely rule out that JAK2-V617F-mutated
NK cells (39), which have been shown to derive from the
JAK2-V617F-mutated lymphohematopoietic progenitor, are
more sensitive to ruxolitinib-induced NK cell inhibition than
their normal counterparts. However, data from a patient with
ruxolitinib treatment interruption showing rapid numerical
NK cell recovery as well as the normal NK cell frequencies in
MPN patients without ruxolitinib argue against an intrinsic
differentiation defect. The potential reversibility of the ruxolitinib effects is also supported by our in vitro ﬁndings that
NK cell function is completely restored upon drug removal.
Of note, previous reports demonstrated that MPN patients
have reduced NK cell numbers (40, 41). Our data are in
contrast to these ﬁndings, as we clearly demonstrate that MPN
patients do per se not have reduced NK cells numbers until
they receive ruxolitinib. However, in these particular articles,
NK cells were characterized by CD16 positivity in the lymphocyte gate, whereas we deﬁned NK cells by CD56þCD3
expression. In adjunct, we demonstrate that CD56bright NK
cell numbers are increased in MPN patients, which may, at
least in part, be due to the hyperinﬂammatory syndrome the
patients have, as well as by a constitutive activation of JAK2
in clonal NK cells leading to CD56 upregulation. This change
is reverted by ruxolitinib back to the level seen in control
persons, presumably as a consequence of its anti-inﬂammatory activity.
In addition, a clear functional deﬁcit of NK cells isolated
from MPN patients could be observed, even if they were not
treated with ruxolitinib. Especially, the killing activity of MPN
NK cells is reduced compared with that of NK cells from
healthy donors. It could not clearly be shown that the functional impairment is further aggravated when patients are
treated with ruxolitinib, as the killing and degranulation
activity was already at a very low level in MPN patients. The
observed trend, however, in downmodulating the functional
activity of NK cells is further supported by decreased expression levels of various NK cell activation markers in ruxolitinib-exposed MPN patients. Ruxolitinib-induced NK cell dysfunction is supported by the reduced frequency of NKp46expressing NK cells when compared with age-matched controls and MPN patients without JAK inhibitor therapy,
although NKp46 expression is regulated in an age-dependent
manner (42).
Our in vivo observations are supported by various in vitro
data. We provide clear evidence that ruxolitinib reduces the
potential of cytokine-mediated activation of NK cells from
healthy donors, whereas the JAK-independent activation
via NKp46 remains unaffected. Inappropriate NK cell activation is mirrored by a reduced expression of NK cell activation markers, such as CD16, CD69, NKG2D, NKp46, and

Ruxolitinib Impairs NK Cell Function

granzyme B. Killing of target cells critically depends on the
generation of a functional lytic synapse (43). Interestingly,
ruxolitinib reduced the ability of NK cells to interact with
target cells and generate lytic synapses, which may, in addition to the reduced expression levels of the NK cell activation
markers, explain the reduced killing capacity of ruxolitinibexposed NK cells. Our data may also be of importance when
considering a recent article showing that JAK inhibitors
increase susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell–mediated
killing (44). However, in this article, the authors focused
only at JAK inhibitory effects on the tumor cell side, whereas
the impact of JAK inhibition on the immune-cell side also has
to be taken into account, as systemic JAK inhibition may
counteract the sensitizing effects on the tumor cell level by
impairing NK cell function. Moreover, in the context of
allogeneic stem cell transplantation, ruxolitinib has recently
been suggested as a potential therapeutic option of GVHD
(45). Our results might also be considered in this context
because NK cells are critical for the graft versus leukemia effect
after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (46).
In summary, our data provide ﬁrst evidence that the JAK
inhibitor ruxolitinib affects key characteristics of human
NK cells, such as cytokine-induced expansion and killing
via an impaired cytokine-mediated NK cell activation, leading to a reduced effector-to-target cell interaction, which is a
prerequisite for most NK cell functions. Accordingly, NK
cells are highly efﬁcient in the recognition and killing of
virally infected cells (47), and, as a consequence, NK cell
deﬁciency leads to a high susceptibility to various infections
(48). Intriguingly, ruxolitinib therapy is also associated
with severe infections, among which disseminated tuberculosis (7, 8), reactivation of hepatitis B (9), progressive
multifocal leukencephalopathy (10), toxoplasmosis retinitis
(11), and Epstein-Barr virus-associated aggressive lymphoma (J. Richter, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; personal
communication, June 2014) are the most alarming ones.
Moreover, reactivation of herpes simplex and varicella zoster infections in ruxolitinib-treated patients is frequent,
similar to patients with an inherited functional NK cell
deﬁciency (49).
Our data may help to better understand the increased rate
of severe infections in ruxolitinib-treated patients by showing potent NK cell–suppressive effects and complement
recent reports on ruxolitinib-induced immune dysfunction
(13, 50), which supports the idea that ruxolitinib is a potent
anti-inﬂammatory compound. The data should also be con-

sidered when testing ruxolitinib in solid tumors, as NK
cells are an important component of cancer immune surveillance (14).
