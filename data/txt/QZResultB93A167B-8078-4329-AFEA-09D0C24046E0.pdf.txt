BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest synergistic activity between somatostatin analogues and mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitors. The activity and safety of everolimus was assessed in combination with octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR)
in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of gastroenteropancreatic and lung origin. METHODS: This was a phase 2, multicenter
trial using a Simon’s 2-stage minimax design. Treatment-naive patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs of gastroenteropancreatic tract and lung origin received everolimus 10 mg daily, in combination with octreotide LAR 30 mg every 28 days. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (median age, 60.5 years) were enrolled. Primary tumor
sites were: pancreas (14 patients), lung (11 patients), ileum (9 patients), jejunum and duodenum (2 patients), and unknown
(14 patients). Thirteen patients (26%) had carcinoid syndrome. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were mostly grade 1 or 2; the
only grade 4 AE was mucositis in 1 patient, whereas grade 3 AEs included skin rash in 1 case (2%), stomatitis in 4 cases (8%), and diarrhea in 11 cases (22%). The ORR was 18%; 2% of patients had a complete response (CR), 16% a partial response (PR) and 74%
achieved stable disease (SD). All CRs and all PRs as well as 92% of SDs had a duration 6 months. The clinical benefit (CR1PR1SD)
was 92%. At a median follow-up of 277 days, median time to progression and overall survival were not reached. CONCLUSIONS: The
everolimus-octreotide LAR combination was active and well tolerated in these previously treated patients with advanced NETs, sugC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of tumors arising from various different epithelial cells with patterns of neuroendocrine differentiation. NETs can arise at any site of the gastrointestinal tract and of the bronchopulmonary system.1
The World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 classification distinguishes this class of diseases between welldifferentiated NETs and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs).2
The most informative sources for NET epidemiology figures are the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases, a comprehensive cancer statistics program widely used to ascertain epidemiologic data across the range of cancer types and throughout the world. The most recently available SEER data
show a significant increase over time in the annual age-adjusted incidence of NET, from 1.09 per 100,000 individuals in
1973 to 5.25 per 100,000 individuals in 2004.3,4
The choice of appropriate treatment for NET represents a challenge, due to the biological and morphological heterogeneity of these tumors. Treatment strategies are formulated depending on functional status and disease stage.

Original Article

For resectable carcinoma, surgery is generally recommended,5 whereas in the case of locoregional unresectable
and metastatic disease, therapeutic options include inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),6-8
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors,9,10 somatostatin analogs (SSAs),11 chemotherapy,12,13 and
radiotherapy.13,14
In recent years, strong evidence has emerged of an
antiproliferative effect of SSAs on NETs, thought to occur
via direct and indirect mechanisms.15 The direct mode of
action involves interaction with somatostatin receptors on
tumor cells leading to activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases16 and modulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.17 The indirect
antiproliferative effect occurs through the inhibition of
expression of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth
factor (IGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF).18
The PROMID study, a randomized phase 3 trial,
was designed to test the hypothesis that SSAs can inhibit
tumor growth. The study evaluated octreotide long-acting
repeatable (LAR) 30 mg versus placebo in 85 patients
with advanced carcinoid tumors of the midgut (jejunum
and ileocecum). A statistically and clinically significant
improvement in median time to progression (TTP) was
observed, from 6 months on the placebo arm to 14.3
months on the experimental arm (hazard ratio 5 0.34;
P 5 .000072). Multivariate analysis suggested that
patients with resected primary tumor and low tumor burden benefited most significantly from treatment with
octreotide, compared with placebo.
Based on the results of the PROMID trial, octreotide LAR therapy is considered to be an appropriate firstline systemic therapy for patients with metastatic unresectable midgut NETs.11 However, PROMID recruited
only patients with well-differentiated midgut primary or
unknown primary NETs, whereas the recent CLARINET
trial included patients with NETs of both gastrointestinal
and pancreatic origins, as did our current study. The preliminary results of CLARINET further confirmed the
antiproliferative role of SSAs (eg, lanreotide) in gastroenteropancreatic NET with a documented previous stable
disease for at least 6 months.19
The serine-threonine kinase mTOR is involved in
the regulation of a variety of cell activities (eg, growth,
proliferation, motility, survival, angiogenesis, protein synthesis, and transcription). The mTOR signaling pathway
is activated in gastroenteropancreatic NET cells7,20 and its
inhibition results in antiproliferative effects on these tumor types.21,22 Everolimus is an oral mTOR inhibitor
2458

approved in the oncology setting, for treatment of
advanced breast cancer, NETs of pancreatic origin
(pNET), and advanced renal cell carcinoma.23,24
In the setting of NET, the RADIANT-3 trial was a
phase 3 randomized double-blind trial of everolimus versus placebo, in patients with a diagnosis of locally
advanced or metastatic well/moderately differentiated
pNET. The results showed that everolimus (at a dose of
10 mg/day) was associated with a 65% reduction in the
estimated risk of progression (progression-free survival of
11.0 months with everolimus versus 4.6 months with placebo, P < .001) and an increase by a factor of 3.7 times in
estimates of the proportion of patients with progressionfree survival at 18 months (34% with everolimus versus
9% with placebo). The benefit was maintained across various subgroups, including those defined according to
whether patients had received previous antitumor
treatments.25
Concurrently, the phase 3 (RADIANT-2) doubleblind trial of octreotide LAR plus everolimus versus
octreotide LAR plus placebo was conducted in patients
with well/moderately differentiated locally advanced or
metastatic NET and history of carcinoid syndrome. On
central radiographic review, median progression-free survival increased from 11.3 months on the octreotide LAR
plus placebo arm to 16.4 months on the octreotide LAR
plus everolimus arm (hazard ratio 5 0.77; P 5 .026).
Although clinically significant, the P value did not meet
the prespecified level of statistical significance of .024.
One potential factor contributing to the lack of statistical
significance was the loss of progression events, caused by
discrepancies in central versus local radiographic
reviews.26
Combination therapy with everolimus plus octreotide LAR might enhance antitumor efficacy by simultaneously targeting upstream and downstream components of
the mTOR pathway.27 The efficacy and safety of both
everolimus and the SSA octreotide LAR have been demonstrated in phase 3 trials in patients with NETs.7,11,26,28
However, this study assesses for the first time the combination of everolimus plus octreotide LAR in treatmentnaive patients with NET of gastroenteropancreatic and
lung origins, with and without carcinoid syndrome.29
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients were eligible for this study if they were aged 18
years or older. Thirty-six patients had histologically confirmed, well-differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic
NEC of the gastroenteropancreatic tract, according to the
WHO 2000 classification,30 which was current at the

time of patient enrollment, or typical and atypical carcinoid of the lung, according to the classification of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).31
In 14 patients, the primary tumor site was unknown.
Main exclusion criteria included any prior anticancer treatment for neuroendocrine tumors, histological
diagnosis of poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma,
and presence of metastatic disease of the central nervous
system. Patients with any severe and/or uncontrolled
medical condition, or other conditions that could affect
participation in the study or with serious neurological or
psychiatric disorders, as well as immunocompromised
subjects and pregnant and lactating females, were also
excluded. Patients with a history of another primary
malignancy were allowed to participate if they had been
disease-free for at least 5 years. Patients with reproductive
potential were required to use adequate contraceptive
methods.
Other key eligibility criteria included the presence of
measurable disease, as assessed according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version
1.1; a WHO performance status of 2 or less (with 0 indicating that the patient is fully active and able to carry on
all predisease activities without restriction; 1 indicating
that the patient is restricted in physically strenuous activity but is ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light
or sedentary nature, such as light housework or office
work; and 2 indicating that the patient is ambulatory and
up and about more than 50% of waking hours and is capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work
activities); adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic
function; and adequately controlled lipid and glucose
concentrations. All patients provided written informed
consent. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics
committees at each participating center. The study was
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
guidelines and with the Declaration of Helsinki.
In this national, multicenter, phase 2 study, patients
were treated with octreotide LAR 30 mg every 28 days in
combination with everolimus (RAD001) 10 mg once
daily continuously. Treatment was continued until progression of the disease, development of unacceptable toxicity, drug interruption for 3 weeks or longer, or
withdrawal of consent. Patients were followed-up for
48 months. Patients could be treated with additional
treatments after progression, at the discretion of their
physician.
The primary endpoint was objective response rate
(ORR); secondary endpoints were time to progression
(TTP) and overall survival (OS). Tumor response was
Cancer

August 15, 2014

assessed by computed tomography measurements of all
target lesions at baseline and every 3 months. RECIST,
version 1.1, was used to assess the type of response.
Adverse events were graded by means of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0
(CTCAE).
Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were summarized by descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were summarized using
counts of patients and percentages. A frequency analysis
of the ORR was performed including also the 95% confidence interval (CI). Survival curves for OS and TTP,
medians, and their 95% CIs were estimated applying
the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical testing was conducted at the 2-sided a 5 0.05 and 95% CI was
employed.
Analyses of efficacy parameters were performed on
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which consisted of
all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.
Analysis of ORR was also repeated on the per-protocol
(PP) analysis consisted of all patients from the ITT population who were evaluable for efficacy without any major
protocol violation and who either had completed a minimum exposure requirement or discontinued for early
disease progression (ie, within the first 12 weeks of
treatment).
An ORR of 5% was set as the lowest probability of
interest in patients with advanced NETs. According to
Simon’s 2-stage minimax design, 29 patients had to be enrolled in the first stage. In case of at least 2 responders, the
trial could continue to the second stage with a further
15 patients. If at least 5 responders were detected among
all 44 patients, the hypothesis of response rate greater than
15% was accepted. Statistical analysis was carried out
using the SAS System software, version 9.2.
The safety analysis was performed on the safety population, which consisted of all patients who received at
least one dose of study drug and had at least one postbaseline safety assessment. All AEs were assigned to a patient
and were classified by primary System Organ Class
according to the MedDRA Thesaurus, version 12.
RESULTS
Patient Population

Between March 2009 and June 2010, 50 patients were enrolled in 5 Italian hospitals. Primary tumor site was pancreas in 14 patients, lung in 11 patients, ileum in
9 patients, and jejunum/duodenum in 2 patients. In
14 patients, the primary tumor site was unknown. From

the total number of patients, 4 were excluded: 3 because
they did not receive a minimum dose intensity corresponding to 50% of the planned dose of everolimus over
the first 8 weeks and 1 because of a major violation of the
protocol (treatment was interrupted because the patient
was first defined as early disease progression; however, the
progression was not confirmed by computed tomography
scan). Therefore, 46 patients were assessable for response
PP. However, the analysis of efficacy parameters was per2460

formed on the ITT population (n550), consisting of all
patients who received at least one dose of everolimus.
Analysis of ORR, TTP, and OS was also repeated on the
PP population.
At the time the manuscript was written, 17 patients,
6 with pancreatic NET (pNET), were still in treatment.
At study entry, all participants had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0. Thirteen patients had carcinoid syndrome, and 38 had a serum
chromogranin A (CgA) concentration above the upper
limit of normal. Median time of treatment was 519.5 days
(range, 49-1158 days), median time from diagnosis to
treatment was 10 weeks, and median drug compliance was
94%. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of
the study population are shown in Table 1.
Tumor and Biochemical Response

The ORR was 18.0% (95% CI 5 9.5%-31.0%) in the
ITT population and 19.6% in the PP population (95%
CI 5 10.4%-33.4%). One patient (2%) achieved a complete response (CR) as best response. The patient had ileum NET and no carcinoid syndrome. Sites of metastases
were liver and peritoneal nodes. Duration of CR was 37
weeks. Eight patients (16%, 2 pancreatic, 1 lung, 1 ileum,
1 duodenum, and 3 unknown NET) had a partial
response (PR). Stable disease (SD) was observed in 38
patients (74%) and progressive disease (PD) in 3 patients
(6%). The CR and all PRs as well as 91.7% of SDs had a
duration  6 months. The clinical benefit rate, calculated
as CR1PR1SD, was 92%. Among 14 patients with
pNET (28% of the ITT population), 2 PR (14%) and no
(0%) CR were reported. The percentage of responses did
not differ between pNET and non-pNET. Thirty-eight
patients had elevated serum CgA concentrations at study
entry. Of these patients, 58% achieved a biochemical
response, with a reduction of  25% of CgA levels.
Subgroup analyses by tumor primary site did not
show any significant difference in ORR. No significant
differences were observed in the ORR between patients
with versus those without carcinoid syndrome.
Time to Progression and Overall Survival

After a median follow-up of 277 days, median TTP was
not reached (Fig. 1), as in the case of median OS (Fig. 2).
There were no significant differences in TTP and OS with
respect to the primary tumor site.
Treatment-Related Toxicity

The majority of the AEs were related to everolimus. All
the AEs associated with octreotide LAR were grade 1 or 2

and were consistent with the known safety profile of the
drug.
Most AEs associated with everolimus were grade 1
or 2 and included mucositis (52%), diarrhea (38%), skin
rash (46%), hypercholesterolemia (26%), and hyperglycemia (18%). Three patients (6%) experienced interstitial
pneumonitis and all recovered after discontinuation of
everolimus and steroid therapy administration. Grade 3
AEs were skin rash (1 patient, 2%), stomatitis (4 patients,
8%) and diarrhea (11 patients, 22%). The only grade 4
AE was mucositis in 1 patient. Hematologic AEs attributed to everolimus included grade 1 and 2 thrombocytopenia (6 patients, 12%), anemia (3 patients, 6%), and
neutropenia (2 patients, 4%). Grade 3 anemia and grade
3 neutropenia occurred each in 1 patient (2%) (Table 2).
One case of sepsis and one myocardial infarction were
reported during treatment. There were no treatmentrelated deaths. The dosage was reduced from 10 to 5 mg/
day in 13 patients (26%) due to toxicity. Eight patients
(16%) discontinued treatment because of AE, but only

3 were considered by investigators to be drug-related (ischemic stroke, grade 4 mucositis, and hypocalcemia).
DISCUSSION
A variety of options exists for the management of
advanced NETs, including surgical, medical, and nuclear
medicine strategies.10,26,32 The long-acting analogs of somatostatin have an established place in the medical treatment of patients with NETs, and the availability of
molecularly targeted agents such as everolimus and sunitinib has expanded the treatment options for patients with
advanced NETs.9,10,33,34 Both everolimus and SSAs have
been associated with antitumor activity in advanced
NETs.6,8,11,22 Everolimus is approved for progressive
NET of pancreatic origin; however, the results reported
here show that this drug also has activity in NET arising
from a broader spectrum of sites.
We conducted a multicenter phase 2 trial, to our
knowledge, the first ever to assess the efficacy and safety of
first-line therapy with everolimus plus octreotide LAR in
advanced NET with different histotypes with and without
carcinoid syndrome, the results of which showed an ORR
of 20%. Our study is in agreement with previous data on
the efficacy of everolimus in pNET6,35 and, most importantly, demonstrates the potential activity of the combination to achieve tumor shrinkage in NETs of all primary
sites, independently from presence or absence of carcinoid
syndrome. In this respect, our findings complement those
reported in the RADIANT-2 trial, showing an improvement of progression-free survival with everolimus plus
octreotide LAR, compared with placebo plus octreotide
LAR, in patients with advanced NETs of various primary
sites associated with carcinoid syndrome.6 Notably, the
combination of everolimus with octreotide LAR was generally well tolerated, and treatment-related AEs were
mostly of grade 1 or 2, consistent with the known safety
profile of these drugs.

Original Article

The exceptional clinical benefit rate obtained in our
study (CR1PR1SD 5 92%) should be considered with
caution, given the size of the patient population studied;
nevertheless, our evidence is encouraging and holds promise in the evolving landscape of NET treatments. Therapeutic strategy for patients with NET may aim to reach a
long-term disease stabilization or an objective response. In
our study, 17 patients were still receiving the combination
treatment at the time of the data cutoff. This provides evidence of a possible role of the combination in long-term
disease control. Previous studies have reported everolimus
efficacy in achieving stable disease. However, this is the
first study to set ORR as the primary endpoint in
treatment-naive NET patients treated with everolimus
plus octreotide LAR. In view of the variable clinical course
of neuroendocrine malignancies, the results of this study
can be seen as encouraging.
In patients with NETs, where pursuing stable disease is the main achievable target, a sequential treatment
may be suitable. In general, the main goal of clinical trials is to improve patient survival or quality of life. However, in specific cases, where the goal is to reduce the size
of a tumor to allow a patient to undergo surgery or to
achieve symptomatic relief, based on the results of our
study, we propose that everolimus in combination with
octreotide LAR is more effective than monotherapy in
increasing the response rate. Further randomized controlled trials with a larger sample size will be required to
establish everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR
as an effective first-line therapeutic option in patients
with NET of any histological type, in the presence or absence of carcinoid syndrome.
