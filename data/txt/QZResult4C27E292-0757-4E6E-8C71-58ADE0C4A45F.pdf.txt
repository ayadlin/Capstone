Cisplatin in Endometrial Cancer Cells
Victoria L. Bae-Jump, MD, PhD; Chunxiao Zhou, MD, PhD; John F. Boggess, MD; and Paola A. Gehrig, MD

BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors modulate signaling pathways involved
in cell cycle progression, and phase 2 trials for endometrial cancer are currently being conducted. Because
rapamycin is known to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs, the authors’ goal was to
examine the effects of rapamycin and cisplatin in endometrial cancer cell lines. METHODS: By using Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells, cell proliferation was assessed after exposure to rapamycin, cisplatin, or both in combination. The combination index (CI) was calculated using the method of Chou and Talalay. Apoptosis was
evaluated by flow cytometry. Immunoblot analysis was performed to assess expression of S6 kinase 1 and
the DNA mismatch repair proteins, MSH2 and MSH6. mTOR small interfering (siRNA) was transfected into
the cell lines, and proliferation and apoptosis were assessed after exposure to cisplatin. RESULTS: Cisplatin
inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (median inhibition concentration of 8-13
lM). Simultaneous exposure of cisplatin in combination with rapamycin resulted in a significant synergistic
antiproliferative effect (CI < 1). Rapamycin increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis and stimulated expression
of MSH2 and MSH6 in the cisplatin-treated cell lines. Cell growth was significantly decreased in cells transfected with mTOR siRNA and treated with cisplatin compared with either alone (CI < 1). Transfection of
mTOR siRNA did not induce apoptosis, but combined treatment with cisplatin increased apoptosis over
that of cisplatin alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study provide evidence of a synergistic
relation between rapamycin and cisplatin in both inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. This
suggests that rapamycin and cisplatin may be a rational combination of a targeted therapy for endometrial

Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and has been increasing
in frequency secondary to an aging female population and changes in dietary and hormonal factors.
Although the majority of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer have early stage disease, which is usually cured with surgery alone, to our knowledge the treatment of women with advanced or recurrent disease
with either cytotoxic or hormonal agents has met with limited success. Thus, there has been a search for an
additional agent, with hopefully a low toxicity profile, that could be used in combination with more traditional hormonal and cytotoxic chemotherapy to dramatically increase efficacy. Many novel agents are

being investigated that target specific cellular signaling
pathways that are believed to be essential in endometrial
cancer progression and metastasis. One of the most promising of these for endometrial cancer is the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.
mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin are known for
their potent antiproliferative properties stemming from
their ability to modulate signal transduction pathways
involved in cell cycle progression from G1 to S-phase and
are currently under evaluation in phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical
trials for a broad range of cancers, including endometrial
cancer.1 Temsirolimus has been shown to increase survival
of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma in a phase 3
trial, and is the first mTOR inhibitor to receive US Food
and Drug Administration approval for cancer therapy.2
Rapamycin and its analogues exert their antiproliferative
effects through the inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase, mTOR, by binding to 1 of the immunophilin family
of FK 506–binding proteins, FKBP 12.3,4 The inhibition
of mTOR decreases phosphorylation and activation of S6
kinase 1 and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which results
in the inhibition of translation of critical mRNAs involved
in cell cycle progression and ultimately, cell cycle arrest in
early G1 phase.3-5 mTOR is also activated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and perturbations in this cell signaling pathway have been implicated in
tumorigenesis for a variety of human cancers.6,7 It has been
hypothesized that those malignancies that rely on PI3K/
Akt-driven mitogen stimulation may be more sensitive to
the effects of rapamycin. Given that loss of PTEN expression is 1 of the most prevalent molecular abnormalities
associated with endometrial cancers, and that wild-type
PTEN down-regulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway, mTOR appears to be an especially promising target for endometrial cancer therapy.8-10
In addition to being used as single-agent therapy,
rapamycin and its analogues have been shown to enhance
the efficacy of several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents
in a variety of different cancers that rely on the mTOR
pathway.11-16 Synergistic interactions have been demonstrated in vitro between rapamycin and paclitaxel, carboplatin, and vinorelbine in breast cancer cells.13 Additive
effects were also noted when rapamycin was used in combination with gemcitabine and doxorubicin.13 Rapamycin dramatically enhanced paclitaxel-induced and
carboplatin-induced apoptosis, at least partially through
3888

caspase activation.13 RAD001 (everolimus), a rapamycin
derivative, has also been reported to increase cisplatininduced apoptosis in wild-type p53 gene lung cancer cells
in vitro through inhibition of p21 translation.11
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum[II]) is a
widely used chemotherapeutic agent that exerts its cytotoxic effects by disrupting the DNA structure in cells
through the formation of intrastrand adducts and interstrand cross-links.17,18 It has proven to be 1 of the most
clinically active agents for the treatment of a variety of
solid tumors, including endometrial carcinoma.19,20
However, its clinical therapeutic effect is often limited by
intrinsic or acquired tumor cell resistance. In addition,
cisplatin’s associated nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity,
especially when administered at higher doses, have been
further obstacles to the success of this treatment.17,18
Thus, our goal was to determine whether rapamycin
would potentiate the effects of cisplatin on endometrial
cancer cells in regard to inhibition of cell growth and
induction of apoptosis, in the hope that these 2 agents
used in combination may be a more effective and less toxic
treatment option for women with recurrent or advanced
stage endometrial cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Reagents
The endometrial cancer cell lines, Ishikawa and ECC-1,
were used. The Ishikawa cells were grown in minimum
essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine and 5
lg/mL bovine insulin. The ECC-1 cells were maintained in
RPMI-1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 200 pg/mL
of estrogen, and 6 mM of sodium bicarbonate. All media
were supplemented with 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100
lg/mL of streptomycin under 5% carbon dioxide. Cisplatin
and rapamycin were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo) and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The M30 CytoDEATH kit was obtained
from Roche (Penzberg, Germany). The polyclonal mTOR,
anti–phospho-S6, non–phospho-S6 antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, Mass).
The anti–b-actin antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Calif). Antibodies to the DNA
mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, MSH2 and MSH6,
were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, Calif). The

reagents were obtained from Amersham (Arlington
Heights, Ill).
Cell Proliferation Assay
The Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells (1  104) were plated in
triplicate onto 96-well culture plates in their corresponding media. The next day, different concentrations of cisplatin, rapamycin, or both in combination were added in
each well. Cells were incubated for 1 to 7 days. Viable cell
densities were determined by measuring metabolic conversion of the colorimetric dye, MTS. MTS was added to
the 96-well plates at 20 lL/well, and plates were incubated for an additional 1 to 2 hours. The MTS assay
results were read by measuring absorbance at 490 nanometers (nm). The effect of cisplatin and rapamycin were
calculated as a percentage of control cell growth obtained
from DMSO-treated cells grown in the same culture
plates. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and
repeated 3 times to assess for consistency of results.

Western Blot Analysis
The Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells were plated at 1  105 cells/
well in 6-well plates in their corresponding media. After 24
hours, cells were treated with rapamycin, cisplatin, or both
combined for 48 hours. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA
buffer (1% NP40, 0.5 sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Equal amounts of protein were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody overnight at 4 C. The membrane
was washed and incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 hour after washing. Antibody binding was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system. Western blot films were digitized, and
band net intensities were quantified by a densitometer using
the Genegynome Image System (Sygene, Frederick, Md).
After developing, the membrane was stripped and reprobed
using an antibody against b-actin to confirm equal loading.
Each experiment was repeated 3 times to assess for consistency of results.

Detection of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry
The Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells were plated in 6-well plates
in their respective medium. After 24 hours, the cells were
treated with cisplatin, rapamycin, or both in combination
for 24 or 48 hours, and then cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and trypsinized.
Cells were fixed in 70% ice-cold methanol and stored at
20 C until flow cytometric analysis. For staining with
M30, the methanol fixed cells were pelleted, had the supernatant fluid removed, and were washed twice with
PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. The cells were blocked with
PBS/0.1% Tween 20 of 1% bovine serum albumin for 10
minutes, pelleted, and had the supernatant fluid removed.
Subsequently, 100 lL of the block solution with a 1:100
dilution of the M30 antibody was added and incubated at
room temperature in the dark for 1 hour. Incubated cells
were washed twice and diluted in a 1% formaldehyde/
PBS solution at 4 C overnight. Unstained and isotype
controls were also run to ensure lack of cross-reactivity
and specificity. Fluorescence was determined by flow
cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, Mass) at 488 nm. Dead cells and debris were gated
out. Each experiment was performed in triplicate to assess
for consistency of results.

Transfection of Small Interfering RNA
mTOR small interfering RNA (siRNA) kits were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. According to the
manufacturer’s instructions, ECC-1 cells were plated in
6-well plates or 12-well plates at the recommended cell
concentration. After 24 hours, transfections were performed at approximately 60% confluency using transfection reagent. For each transfection reaction, 100 nM
mTOR siRNA or control siRNA was used for preparation
of siRNA-transfection complexes at room temperature for
15 minutes. Transfections were performed in 0.5 (12-well
plate) or 1.5 mL (6-well plate) serum-free medium for 8
hours. After incubation, transfection complexes were
removed and replaced with their corresponding media. In
each experiment, untreated controls receiving transfection
reagent were included. Transfection efficiency (80%90%) was determined by fluorescence microscope in fluorescein-labeled nonspecific siRNA transfected cells. Cells
were assayed 24 to 48 hours after transfection.
Synergistic Analysis
Statistical analysis on synergy was used to evaluate the
effects of combined drug treatments. The results from the

FIGURE 1. Effect of cisplatin (PDD) with and without rapamycin (Rap) on the proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells is
shown. Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of (A) rapamycin and (B) cisplatin for
96 hours. Rapamycin enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin after 48 hours of exposure in both the (C) Ishikawa and (D) ECC-1 cell
lines. Relative growth of cells was determined by MTS. The results are shown as the mean  the standard error of triplicate samples and are representative of 3 independent experiments.

MTS assays were calculated by the CalcuSyn for Windows
computer program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) to determine the presence of synergy between rapamycin and cisplatin. The software uses a median-effect
method, which is a well-established procedure to quantify
the effects of drug combinations and to determine
whether they produce greater effects together than
expected from simple summation of their individual
effects. This methodology was originally described by
Chou and Talalay.21 The combination index (CI) values
are obtained from the data, and reflect the nature of the
interaction between rapamycin and cisplatin, that is, < 1,
synergistic activity; ¼1, additive; >1, antagonism.

cytotoxicity, and the induction of apoptosis. Rapamycin
alone inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
in both the Ishikawa (median inhibition concentration
[IC50] ¼ 0.5) and ECC-1 (IC50 ¼ 0.05) cell lines after 48
to 96 hours of exposure (Fig. 1A). As expected, cisplatin
alone also potently inhibited growth in a dose-dependent
manner in both of these cell lines, with IC50 values of 8
lM and 13 lM, respectively (Fig. 1B). These cell lines
were then treated with serial dilutions of both cisplatin
and rapamycin, and their individual and combined effects
on growth inhibition were evaluated. Median-effect plot
analyses and calculation of the multiple drug effect/CI
was performed using the well-established method of
Chou and Talalay via a commercial software package
obtained from Calcusyn (Biosoft).21 In these analyses, CI
values are calculated for different dose-effect levels based
on parameters derived from median-effect plots of rapamycin alone, cisplatin alone, or both of these agents used
in combination at fixed molar ratios. A CI value significantly < 1 indicates synergy, a CI not significantly different from 1 indicates addition, and a CI significantly >1
indicates antagonism. Synergy is defined as a combination

of 2 agents that has a greater therapeutic effect than would
be expected by the simple addition of the individual
effects of each drug.
Simultaneous exposure of various doses of cisplatin
in combination with 1 nM rapamycin on these endometrial cancer cell lines resulted in a significant synergistic
antiproliferative effect, with a CI of < 1, at a range of
0.023 to 0.479 (Table 1). Synergistic effects on cell proliferation were also observed when different concentrations
of cisplatin were combined with 0.1 nM and 10 nM rapamycin in both of these cell lines (data not shown).

FIGURE 2. Rapamycin (Rap) was found to enhance cisplatininduced apoptosis. (A) Ishikawa and (B) ECC-1 cells were cultured for 24 hours and then treated with different concentrations of cisplatin (PDD) with or without rapamycin (1 nM) for
48 hours. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric analysis of M30 expression. Data shown are representative of at
least 2 independent experiments.

Rapamycin Enhanced Cisplatin-induced
Apoptosis
The induction of apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with the M30 antibody after treatment with cisplatin
in the Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells. The M30 antibody
detects a cytokeratin neoepitope generated after cleavage
at position 387 to 396, and is considered to be a specific
marker for epithelial apoptosis.22-24 After exposure to various concentrations of cisplatin (1 lM, 10 lM, and 50
lM) for 48 hours, a significant dose-dependent increase
in the expression of M30 was observed in both cell lines.
We further investigated whether rapamycin in combination with cisplatin would enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Previously, we have demonstrated that rapamycin
alone had no effect on apoptosis in an endometrial cancer
cell lines.25 Treatment with rapamycin (1 nM) with different concentrations of cisplatin induced increases in the
percentage of expression of M30 in both cell lines (Fig. 2).
Similar results were found when rapamycin at 0.1 nM and
10 nM were used in combination with cisplatin. These
Cancer

results indicate that rapamycin enhances the efficacy of
cisplatin by increasing cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

Effect of Rapamycin and Cisplatin on
mTOR Pathway
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the synergistic
antiproliferative effect between rapamycin and cisplatin,
we characterized the effect of this combination treatment
on relevant cell signaling targets. Previous studies suggest
that p70S6K is a downstream target of the mTOR pathway.26 p70S6K kinase directly phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal protein S6, which results in enhanced translation
of proteins that contain a polypyrimidine tract in the 50 untranslated region.26 Therefore, we studied the effect of
rapamycin and cisplatin on the phosphorylation of the S6
ribosomal protein in both cell lines. As would be expected,
3891

Original Article

rapamycin alone reduced the phosphorylation of S6 and
resulted in decreased levels of total S6 after 48 hours of exposure. We have previously demonstrated that rapamycin
rapidly inhibits S6 phosphorylation as early as 15 minutes
after exposure, and that this effect persists for 24 to 48

hours after initial treatment.25,27 In contrast, cisplatin did
not affect phosphorylation of S6 or expression of total S6
protein. Rapamycin in combination with cisplatin
decreased phosphorylation of S6 and total protein expression of S6, similar to treatment with rapamycin alone
(Fig. 3). This suggests that rapamycin may exert its synergistic effect through the mTOR pathway by regulating
phosphorylation of the S6 protein.
Selective Gene Silencing of mTORenhanced Cisplatin-induced Apoptosis

FIGURE 3. Rapamycin (Rap) inhibits S6 phosphorylation in
Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells. The cells were treated with cisplatin
(PDD) (10 lM) alone, rapamycin (1 nM) alone, or in combination for 48 hours. Total protein was analyzed by Western blot
analysis with antibodies against phospho-S6 (ser235 of 236),
total S6, and b-actin as indicated. Note that cisplatin was not
found to affect phosphorylated S6 (P-S6) expression.

To specifically determine whether mTOR is required for
increased cisplatin sensitivity and enhanced cisplatininduced apoptosis, mTOR siRNA was transfected into
each of these endometrial cancer cell lines. Control siRNA
was transfected into these same lines as the control for
these experiments. A significant decrease in cell growth after 48 to 96 hours was found in those cells transfected
with mTOR siRNA and treated with cisplatin (10 lM),

compared with control siRNA-transfected cells treated with rapamycin (Rap) (1 nM), cisplatin (10 lM), or both combined. Cell

using the M30 antibody by flow cytometry. Cells were transfected with 100 nM of mTOR siRNA or control siRNA for 8 hours. Cisplatin at 10 lM was added to both mTOR siRNA–transfected and control siRNA–transfected cells for an additional 48 hours. (C)

as compared with either of these treatments used alone
(Fig. 4A). Synergy was also found between cisplatin and
mTOR siRNA in these cell lines (CI < 1; range, 0.5650.850) (Table 2). Transfection of mTOR siRNA alone
did not induce apoptosis, but combined treatment with
cisplatin increased apoptosis at higher levels than noted in
cells treated with cisplatin only (Fig. 4B). Western immunoblot analysis showed that cells transfected with mTOR
siRNA specifically reduced mTOR protein expression
and decreased phosphorylation of S6 protein, a downstream target of this pathway (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that mTOR is a key target in regulation of rapamycin
sensitization of endometrial cancer cells to cisplatininduced apoptosis.

Effect of Rapamycin on DNA MMR Protein
Expression
Although treatment with rapamycin alone does not affect
apoptosis in the endometrial cancer cell lines, rapamycin
did appear to enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig.
2). To determine a possible underlying mechanism for
this finding, we assessed expression of the DNA MMR
proteins, MSH2 and MSH6, after exposure to rapamycin
(1 nM), cisplatin (10 lM), or both in combination. We
initially performed a time course experiment and studied
their individual and combined effects at 12 hours, 24
hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours of exposure. Although we
noted a small effect at 12 hours, greater effects were
observed between 24 and 72 hours after treatment with
either cisplatin alone or combination treatment with cisplatin and rapamycin (data not shown). Different doses of
each of these drugs were also evaluated, with greater effects
noted with increasing doses, particularly of cisplatin. On
the basis of these initial experiments, we decided to use

the IC50 doses for each drug and the 48-hour time point
for the majority of the work. Cisplatin increased expression of both MSH2 and MSH6 in the ECC-1 and Ishikawa cell lines (Fig. 5). As quantified by a densitometer
and normalized to control, cisplatin treatment resulted in
a 1.9–fold to 2.3–fold increase in MSH2 expression and a
1.3–fold to 2.1–fold increase in MSH6 expression. The
combination of cisplatin and rapamycin resulted in
greater stimulation of MSH2 and MSH6 expression than
cisplatin alone. Treatment with cisplatin and rapamycin
increased MSH2 expression by 2.5–fold to 2.8–fold and
increased MSH6 expression by 1.5–fold to 2.4–fold.
These effects were more pronounced in the Ishikawa cell
line. Rapamycin alone consistently appeared to have no
effect on MSH2 and MSH6 expression, even at different
time points or doses. Thus, the increased expression of
MSH2 and MSH6 by rapamycin in cisplatin-treated endometrial carcinoma cell lines may contribute to rapamycin’s observed enhancement of cisplatin-induced
apoptosis. These results, although subtle, were found to
be consistent among 3 independent Western blot
analyses.

DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated a synergistic relation between
rapamycin and cisplatin in regard to both the inhibition
of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human endometrial cancer cell lines. This was further substantiated by
blocking mTOR expression through mTOR siRNA and
demonstrating that decreased mTOR signaling is an
3893

Original Article

essential mechanism for rapamycin chemosensitization
and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, rapamycin
increased the expression of DNA MMR proteins in cisplatin-treated endometrial carcinoma cell lines, and this may
be a possible underlying mechanism for rapamycin’s
enhancement of cisplatin-induced apoptosis. This suggests that the combination of rapamycin and cisplatin
may be an effective targeted therapy for endometrial
cancer.
Synergy in the current study was quantified using
the combination index equation of Chou and Talalay,
which allows for the evaluation of 2 or more chemotherapeutic agents at different concentrations and effect levels.21 Through this methodology, combinations of drugs
can be analyzed for synergy versus antagonism as well as
their maximal antitumor efficacy. Such analyses have been
the scientific basis for clinical protocol designs, such as the
use of trastuzumab with docetaxol and cisplatin in
patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor2(HER-2)–positive advanced breast cancer.28,29 Traditionally, new combination therapeutic treatments for cancer have evolved through the addition of a new drug to a
pre-existing established regimen. Given the number of
new and old drugs available, this strategy is useful and efficient in identifying which combinations have statistically
significant synergistic interactions in vitro, thus narrowing
the potential choices to those combinations that may have
the greatest clinical benefit and deserve testing in future
human trials.
DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin, have had a
major impact on the treatment of a wide range of cancers,
including gynecologic malignancies, but the use of cisplatin is often limited by its intolerable side effects and inevitable chemoresistance. Rapamycin and its derivatives have
been proposed as potentially potent chemotherapeutic
chemosensitizers. Cisplatin and rapamycin have exhibited
synergy through the inhibition of cell proliferation and
induction of apoptosis in many types of cancer cells,
including lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and
primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells.11,12,14,16 We have
demonstrated that even low doses of rapamycin (1 nM) in
combination with low doses of cisplatin (0.01 lM)
resulted in a strong synergistic effect and a substantial 2–
fold to 3–fold decrease in the IC50 of cisplatin (Fig. 1)
(Table 1). Although rapamycin does not significantly
induce apoptosis in these endometrial cancer cell lines,25 we
3894

found that treatment with rapamycin and cisplatin together
increased the induction of apoptosis and caspase activity,
well above the effects of cisplatin alone (Fig. 2). Thus,
mTOR inhibition by rapamycin may have the potential to
inhibit tumor growth as well as enhance the effects of
cisplatin at lower doses, culminating in overall decreased
multiorgan toxicities for endometrial cancer patients.
Although rapamycin and its derivatives clearly act as
cytostatic agents by arresting cells in the G1 phase, these
agents are generally not believed to induce apoptosis,
except potentially in tumor cells lacking functional
p53.30,31 Both of the endometrial cancer cell lines in this
study express functional p53 (data not shown), which
allows us to believe that the results shown in Figure 2 are
not a result of an independent increase in rapamycininduced apoptosis. Thus, the mechanism by which
rapamycin enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis is poorly
understood. It has been demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors may sensitize tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents
by blocking up-regulation of p21, thus shifting the equilibrium of the cell toward apoptosis.11 This was shown to
be true for wild-type p53 human lung cancer cell lines,
but not mutant p53 tumor cells.11 In contrast, in p53-deficient human ovarian cancer cell lines, cisplatin in combination with the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 resulted in
induction of p21.32,33 In a subsequent study, RAD001
enhanced the sensitivity of these ovarian cancer cell lines
to cisplatin, independent of p53 status.14 This discrepancy between studies may reflect inherent molecular differences between tumor types, resulting in interruption of
specific signaling cascades, and thus their potentially varied response to mTOR inhibition in combination with
DNA-damaging agents.
DNA MMR is a highly conserved pathway that follows a stepwise sequence of events, involving the recognition and correction of DNA errors occurring
spontaneously during replication. Several proteins are
involved in the initiation of MMR, including the 3 MutS
homologs (MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6). The MutS
homologs form a heterodimer that recognizes DNA damage. This process eventually leads to excision of the damaged DNA strand and resynthesis. A functional MMR
system is required for the detection of DNA damage created by cisplatin-induced adducts.34,35 Platinum complexes interfere with normal MMR activity, resulting in
failure of DNA repair and ultimately apoptosis. Loss of

MMR function, possibly by altering adduct detection, has
been linked to cisplatin-resistance in a variety of different
tumor types.36
As would be predicted, cisplatin increased expression of MSH2 and MSH6 in the endometrial cancer cell
lines. However, surprisingly, treatment with rapamycin
appeared to stimulate MSH2 and MSH6 expression in
cisplatin-treated endometrial carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 5).
This finding, although subtle as demonstrated by Western
immunoblot analysis, was found to be consistent between
3 independent experiments. To our knowledge, this is the
first reported link between rapamycin and regulation of
MMR proteins. These results, in part, may be an alternative explanation for rapamycin’s enhancement of cisplatin-induced apoptosis that warrants further investigation.
Given that the abortive efforts to repair DNA damage are
paramount to cisplatin’s cytotoxicity, we theorize that
rapamycin facilitates this process by augmenting production of the MMR proteins.
Rapamycin is known to inhibit mTOR kinase activity, resulting in dephosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1,
which are 2 critical downstream translational regulators.
Inhibition of S6 and 4E-BP1 activity leads to decreased
global translation and ribosome biogenesis of proteins
that are essential for cell cycle progression from G1 to Sphase.3,4 Cisplatin treatment alone did not affect phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 3), whereas combining treatment
with rapamycin reduced phosphorylation of S6 with a
concomitant reduction in total S6 protein. Knockout of
mTOR by targeted siRNA increased cellular sensitivity to
cisplatin, as manifested through the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4) (Table 2). This
suggests that decreased mTOR signaling is an essential
step for rapamycin-enhanced chemosensitivity to cisplatin
in endometrial cancer cells, but the underlying molecular
mechanism still remains to be determined. However,
given that these 2 agents appear to exert their antitumorigenic effects through distinct but somehow convergent
pathways in relation to cell growth and death, this is the
probable basis for their synergistic relationship and lends
credence for their potential clinical application.
Rapamycin and its analogues have been shown to
increase the efficacy of several cytotoxic and hormonal
agents in other tumor types, but to our knowledge have
not been systematically studied in endometrial cancer
cells. mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated great promise

in endometrial cancer as single agents, but our hypothesis
is that combination therapy may afford better alternatives
for a cancer in which cytotoxic and hormonal agents have
had limited success. Thus, our future goals are to evaluate
mTOR inhibitors in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of endometrial cancer to assess potential synergy in vitro and in
vivo. This work should potentially provide the scientific
foundation for rational combinations to test in subsequent clinical trials of women with recurrent or metastatic
endometrial cancer.
