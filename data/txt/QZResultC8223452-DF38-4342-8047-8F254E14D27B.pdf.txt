BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare immunologic, virologic, and clinical outcomes between living human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who had a diagnosis of lymphoma versus outcomes in a control group of cancer-free,
HIV-infected patients. METHODS: In this matched cohort study, patients in the case group were survivors of incident lymphomas that
occurred between 1997 and June 2010. Controls were living, cancer-free, HIV-infected patients who were matched to cases at a 4:1 ratio by age, sex, nadir CD4 cell count, and year of HIV diagnosis. The date of lymphoma diagnosis served as the baseline in cases and
in the corresponding controls. RESULTS: In total, 62 patients (cases) who had lymphoma (20 with Hodgkin disease [HD] and 42 with
non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL]) were compared with 211 controls. The overall median follow-up was 4.8 years (interquartile range,
2.0-7.9 years). The CD4 cell count at baseline was 278 cells/mm3 (interquartile range, 122-419 cells/mm3) in cases versus 421 cells/
mm3 (interquartile range, 222-574 cells/mm3) in controls (P 5.003). At the last available visit, the CD4 cell count was 412 cells/mm3
(range, 269-694 cells/mm3) in cases versus 518 cells/mm3 (interquartile range, 350-661 cells/mm3) in controls (P 5.087). The proportion of patients who achieved virologic success increased from 30% at baseline to 74% at the last available visit in cases (P 5.008)
and from 51% to 81% in controls (P 5.0286). Patients with HD reached higher CD4 cell counts at their last visit than patients with NHL
(589 cells/mm3 [range, 400-841 cells/mm3] vs 332 cells/mm3 [interquartile range, 220-530 cells/mm3], respectively; P 5.003). Virologic success was similar between patients with HD and patients with NHL at the last visit. Forty cases (65%) and 76 controls (36%)
experienced at least 1 clinical event after baseline (P <.0001); cases were associated with a shorter time to occurrence of the first clinical event compared with controls (P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected lymphoma survivors experienced more clinical events
than controls, especially during the first year of follow-up, but they reached similar long-term immunologic and virologic outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) noticeably reduced mortality and morbidity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and lowered the incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related cancers,1 4 lymphomas still remain a major issue in the HIV-infected population.5,6 Main concerns regarding the
use of chemotherapy (CT) in HIV-infected patients, compared with the general population, are subsequent immune
depletion and an increased rate of infections,7 mostly because, like most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), AIDS-related
cancers generally occur when the CD4 cell count is low and the patient is severely immunosuppressed.8 Moreover, different CT regimens used to treat lymphoma have an impact on the development of metabolic comorbidities,9 11 which may
contribute to the premature ageing described in the HIV-infected population.12,13
After the introduction of HAART, immune recovery after CT and autologous stem cell transplantation appeared to
approach the recovery observed in immunocompetent patients14,15; however, data on long-term immunologic and virologic outcome as well as the development of clinical complications are lacking. The objective of the current study was to
compare, over a 10-year period, HIV viral load suppression, CD4 cell count recovery, and the proportion of clinical events

and individuals without lymphoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This was a matched cohort study of HIV-infected patients
recorded in the Infectious Diseases Database of the San
Raffaele Hospital (IDD-HSR). This hospital is a multidisciplinary university scientific institute with specialized
outpatient facilities and hospital wards; the hospital also
includes many research units working on basic science or
clinical topics.
The Infectious Diseases Department currently follows more than 4500 HIV-infected patients; within the
Department, an observational database (the IDD-HSR; it
is included in the most important European cohort networks, such as COHERE, EuroSIDA, D:A:D) collects
demographic, clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data on
adult patients who are receiving primary care for HIV
infection, as either outpatients or inpatients, at the department. At the first visit to our clinic, patients provide written informed consent to include their clinical and
laboratory data in the IDD-HSR for scientific purposes.
Clinical data are systematically recorded by infectious diseases specialists working at the clinic using an electronic
chart linked to the database.
In the current study, we included cases and controls
who were aged >18 years, who were alive, and who were
followed in our clinic at time of data cutoff (December
31, 2010). For the case group, we identified HIV-infected
patients in the IDD-HSR database who were diagnosed
with histologically confirmed, high-grade NHL or Hodgkin disease (HD) since January 1, 1997; who successfully
completed CT (within approximately 6 months); who
were alive as of December 31, 2010; and who had data
available on their date of birth, sex, date of first HIV-positive test, and date of cancer occurrence.
A control sample (n 5 211) of living, HIV-infected
patients from the same cohort in the IDD-HSR database
who did not have any cancer diagnosis (up to December
31, 2010) was matched to cases at a 4:1 ratio by age (61
year), sex, nadir CD4 count (650 cells/mm3), year of
HIV diagnosis (61 year), and index year (year of the
matched case’s lymphoma diagnosis). Forty-three patients
with lymphoma were matched with 4 controls, 7 patients
were matched with 3 controls, 6 patients were with 2 controls, and 6 patients were matched with 1 control. Age
and nadir CD4 count were evaluated at the index date.

An index date (defined as baseline) was assigned to
each case and control. For cases, the index date was the
date of their lymphoma diagnosis. For controls, the
assigned index date was the index date of their corresponding case. In patients who had more than 1 diagnosis
of lymphoma, we considered the first event. Follow-up
was determined as the time interval between baseline and
the last visit for which data were available.
HIV diagnosis was defined as the date of the first
HIV-positive test. Virologic success (VS) was defined as
the determination of an HIV-1 RNA plasma level <50
copies/mL. Among HIV-infected patients, VS has been
possible only after the introduction of HAART; thus, to
properly evaluate the proportion of VS in the 2 groups,
for the current study, we decided to consider only cases
and corresponding controls with an index date after January 1, 1997 (according to the availability of HAART in
Italy).
Specific prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (for a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3), Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis (for a CD4 cell count <100
cells/mm3 and positive immunoglobulin G), and Mycobacterium avium complex infection (for a CD4 cell count
<50 cells/mm3) was prescribed according to Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations (200916 and earlier versions17,18) in both cases and
controls.
A clinical event was defined as any confirmed diagnosis, observed after baseline and recorded in the IDDHSR database, of the following categorized diseases: B
events and C events according to the 1993 CDC classification,19 non-HIV related infectious events, and noninfectious events. For non-HIV related infectious events,
in the current analysis, we considered events that required
intravenous therapy and/or hospitalization: sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis, intra-abdominal infections (including genitourinary tract infections), central nervous system
infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and bone
infections.
For noninfectious events, we considered metabolic
complications grouped as follows: cardiovascular events
(myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke), bone events (osteoporosis
[diagnosed according to the Italian guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of osteoporosis20] and
fractures), first diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 (diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association Criteria21), cirrhosis (diagnosed by liver biopsy or elastography),
and first diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (defined
according to National Kidney Foundation Criteria22).

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were described by median values
and first and third quartiles. Chi-square tests or MannWhitney tests were used to compare characteristics of
cases and controls.
Variations in CD4 cell counts were calculated as
changes from baseline. All CD4 values available during
follow-up within each patient were used for the analysis of
immunologic changes. Univariable mixed linear models
were applied to identify whether some fixed effects (lymphoma occurrence [yes vs no], or type of lymphoma [HD
vs NHL], or histologic type of NHL [diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) vs Burkitt lymphoma], or the
receipt of rituximab [yes vs no]) that were included alternatively in different models were associated with a mean
change in the CD4 cell count from baseline. On the basis
of Akaike information criteria, we used an autoregressive
order of 1 (AR[1]) covariance structure to control for the
correlation within each patient over time. Parameter estimates were obtained by using the maximum likelihood
method; mean changes in the CD4 cell count with the
corresponding standard error were reported and compared between groups.
For the analysis of VS, HIV-1 RNA values (630
days) nearest to the considered time points (ie, baseline, 6
months, 1 year, and subsequent 1-year intervals) were
used. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the
linear trend of VS during follow-up, and the CochranMantel-Haenszel test was calculated to evaluate differences between strata. Differences in the categories of clinical
events between cases and controls or between histologic
type of lymphoma were evaluated using the chi-square
test.
Time to first clinical event distributions were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons
for differences were assessed by using the log-rank test. All
statistical tests were 2-sided at the 5% level, and statistical
analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical software
package (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
We compared 62 HIV-infected patients who had lymphoma (20 HD and 42 NHL) with 211 controls. Overall,
273 patients were included in this study and had a median
follow-up of 4.8 years (interquartile range, 2.0-7.9 years;
cases: 4.6 years [interquartile range, 2.2-8.1 years]; controls: 4.8 years [interquartile range, 2.0-7.9 years];
P 5 .888). Among cases, the year of lymphoma diagnosis
was 2005 (interquartile range, 2001-2007).
2712

Patients received the following CT regimens: 1)
all patients with HD received 6 cycles of a doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine regimen23,24;
2) 33 patients with DLBCL received 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP),23,25 and 11 of those patients also
received rituximab according to their CD20-positivite
status and CD4 cell count25; 3) 9 patients with Burkitt NHL (BURL) received different CT regimens,
including 4 who received CHOP (1 with associated
rituximab), 3 who received a German Multicenter
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) protocol,26
and 2 who received a new, intensive, short-term chemoimmunotherapy regimen.27
Two of 33 patients with DLBCL failed on the
CHOP regimen and received an additional high-dose CT
regimen (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin [R-DHAP]) and underwent subsequent autologous
transplantation.28 In addition, 1 patient with HD
relapsed 4 years after the first episode and also received
high-dose R-DHAP and underwent subsequent autologous transplantation.
The characteristics of cases and controls are listed in
Table 1. The 2 groups differed in terms of AIDS diagnosis
before baseline (P 5 .029) and years of HAART exposure
(P 5 .046).
At baseline, cases presented with significantly lower
CD4 cell counts and a higher viral loads than controls; the
proportion of VS was lower in cases than in controls (30%
vs 51%, respectively; P 5 .008). Almost all patients in
both groups were receiving antiretroviral treatment at
baseline, including 202 controls (96%) and 59 cases
(95%; P 5 .717). Case characteristics according to the
type of lymphoma (NHL and HD) are listed in Table 2.
CD4 Recovery

During follow-up, patients with and without lymphoma
had different immunologic recoveries. The mean change
in CD4 count among cases was 106 6 24 cells/mm3 compared with 58 6 13 cells/mm3 among controls
(P < .0001). The CD4 count change differed significantly
during the first 6 months of follow-up between cases
(mean change, 241 6 12 cells/mm3) compared with controls (mean change, 114 6 6 cells/mm3; P < .0001). In
the first year, the mean CD4 change was 234 6 15 cells/
mm3 in cases and 115 6 8 cells/mm3 in controls
(P 5 .004). After 1 year, the increase in the CD4 count
was 141 6 34 cells/mm3 among cases and 69 6 18 cells/
mm3 among controls (P 5 .062), reaching similar longterm CD4 count values (Fig. 1).

Patients with HD and NHL were associated with a
different mean change in their CD4 count during followup (NHL, 75 6 34 cells/mm3; HD, 172 6 48 cells/mm3;
P 5 .011) (Fig. 2). No differences were detected between
patients with HD or with NHL compared with their controls regarding mean CD4 changes during follow-up (HD

In patients who developed NHL, we did not observe
significant differences between those with DLBCL
(n 5 33) and those with BURL (n 5 9) regarding the baseline CD4 cell count (DLBCL, 217 cells/mm3 [interquartile

cells/mm3; P 5 .442) compared with patients who did
not receive CT that included rituximab (n 5 25).
HIV Viral Suppression

The trend of VS in cases and controls is illustrated in Figure
3. The proportion of patients with VS increased significantly
over time in cases (Ptrend < .0001) and controls
(Ptrend < .0001; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test; P < .0001).
The proportion of VS increased from 30% at baseline to
74% at the last available visit in cases and from 51% to 81%
in controls (baseline, P 5 .008; last visit, P 5 .286).
When considering the histologic type of lymphoma
(HD or NHL), different proportions of VS were observed
(Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test; P < .0001). Among the
patients with NHL, the VS proportion increased significantly during follow-up: at baseline, at 1 year, and at the
last visit, the VS proportions 24%, 55%, and 74%,
respectively (Ptrend < .0001). VS also increased during follow-up among the corresponding controls: the VS proportions at baseline, at 1 year, and at the last visit were

patients with NHL regarding VS at the last available
visit (P 5 .920).
In patients who developed NHL, we did not observe
significant differences between those with DLBCL
(n 5 33) and those with BURL (n 5 9) regarding the VS
proportion at baseline (DLBCL vs BURL: 7 patients
[22%] vs 3 patients [33%]; P 5 .662), at 6 months
(DLBCL vs BURL: 21 patients [31%] vs 8 patients
[38%]; P 5 .598), or at the last visit (DLBCL vs BURL:
27 patients [82%] vs 7 patients [78%]; P 5 .999). In
addition, patients with NHL who received a rituximabcontaining CT regimen (n 5 17) presented with a similar
VS proportion at baseline (4 patients [25%] vs 6 patients
[24%]; P 5 .999), at 6 months (15 patients [43%] vs 14
patients [26%]; P 5 .110), and at the last visit (12 patients
[71%] vs 22 patients [88%]; P 5 .235) compared with
patients who did not receive rituximab (n 5 25).
Clinical Events

Seventy-four events occurred in cases, and 164 clinical
events occurred in controls. The proportion of patients
who had at least 1 clinical event differed significantly
between cases (40 patients; 65%) and controls (76
patients; 36%; P < .0001). This difference also was statistically significant when we separately considered patients
with NHL versus corresponding controls (27 cases [64%]
vs 36 controls [38%]; P 5 .005) and patients with HD
versus corresponding controls (13 cases [65%] vs 17 controls [32%]; P 5 .016); however, no difference was
observed between patients with HD and patients with
NHL (P 5 .956). Thirty-nine cases (63%) and 76 controls (36%) were hospitalized for at least 1 event
(P 5 .0002; HD, 13 patients [65%]; NHL, 26 patients
[62%]; P 5 .814).
Similar proportions of B events and C events were
observed among cases and controls (at least 1 B event: 2
cases [3.2%] vs 10 controls [4.7%]; P 5 .999; at least 1 C
event: 5 cases [8.1%] vs 19 controls [9%]; P 5 .999).
Higher proportions of cases experienced at least 1 nonHIV related infectious event than controls (27 cases
[44%] vs 45 controls [21%]; P < .0001). No differences
in the proportions of patients who had at least 1 noninfectious event were observed between cases and controls (16
cases [25.8%] vs 39 controls [18.5%]; P 5 .211). No differences were observed between patients with HD and
patients with NHL regarding B events (2 patients [10%]
vs 0 patients, respectively; P 5 .10), C events (0 patients
[0%] vs 5 patients [12%], respectively; P 5 .165), nonHIV related infectious events (9 patients [45%] vs 18
patients [43%], respectively; P 5 .874), or noninfectious
2716

events (7 patients [35%] vs 9 patients [21%], respectively;
P 5 .353).
Cases were associated with a shorter time to first
clinical event than controls, as indicated in Figure 4
(P < .0001). Differences between cases and controls were
concentrated within the first 6 months: cases experienced
non-HIV related infectious events (17 cases [27%] and
6 controls [3%]; P < .0001) and C events (3 cases [5%]
and 1 control [1%]; P 5 .038) more frequently than controls. No differences in B events or noninfectious events
were reported among cases and controls according to the
time of occurrence of clinical events.
Evaluating non-HIV related infectious events, sepsis was the most frequent event in cases (24 events; 57%),
whereas virus infections (labial herpes simplex infections,
monometameric herpes zoster, chickenpox, acute viral
hepatitis) were the most frequent in controls (21 events;
31%). Among cases, only 1 patient developed a second
different malignancy (squamocellular carcinoma of the
oral cavity) 2 years after the diagnosis of lymphoma.
Finally, we did not observe significant differences in the
proportion of clinical events between patients who did or
did not receive rituximab (53% vs 72%, respectively;
P 5 .326).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared long-term outcomes, including CD4 recovery, VS, and the occurrence of clinical
events, between HIV-infected lymphoma survivors and
matched HIV-infected patients without lymphoma during a long follow-up period. We observed a significant restoration of the CD4 cell count in HIV-related lymphoma
survivors. Although a lower CD4 count was observed in
cases at baseline and during the first-year of follow-up, no
differences were noted between the 2 groups at subsequent
time points. This finding suggests that lymphoma occurrence and subsequent CT did not impair long-term CD4
recovery in our population, as reported by other studies.14,15,29 31 Conversely, we observed a significant, persistent immunologic recovery over a longer follow-up
period, confirming that effective antiretroviral treatment
leads long-term virologic efficacy, even in patients who
receive CT.32
With respect to virologic suppression, the overall
proportion of VS increased in lymphoma survivors during
follow-up and reached proportions comparable to those
of controls. Although we observed long-term immunologic recovery and viral suppression, cases experienced
more clinical events (P < .0001) than controls. Not surprisingly, cases experienced more infectious events during

the first 6 months of follow-up, overlapping the CT
administration period. During the same period, cases
experienced more non-HIV related infectious events
(such as sepsis) and C events than controls. The higher
number of clinical events registered among cases and the
shorter time to event occurrence are compatible with a
direct role of CT in the occurrence of clinical events
among cases because of CT toxicity and its detrimental
effect on immune function, as demonstrated previously.33 35 During follow-up, no other differences in
the proportions of clinical events were observed, in line
with the immunologic recovery observed.
We might have expected higher proportions of metabolic complications because of CT—in particular, kidney, heart, and liver toxicities36,9,10—and higher
incidence of osteoporosis and diabetes because of the use
of steroids; however, cases and controls experienced a similar proportion of noninfectious events during the entire
follow-up period. Although the closer clinical and radiologic follow-up of patients after a diagnosis of lymphoma
than that of controls may have lowered the incidence of
preventable clinical events, the lack of any difference
observed in the proportion of noninfectious events may
have been caused by 1) the very long latency period of this
type of pathology, which did not allow us to detect differences between groups, and 2) the relative short-term exposure to possible risk factors for these pathologies (eg
steroid use for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
and osteoporosis). In addition, although noninfectious
events have been clearly related to aging, immunodeficiency, and HIV-related factors,37 39 the impact of age,
years of exposure to HIV infection, and nadir CD4 counts

on the occurrence of such events in the 2 groups may have
been paired, because cases and controls were matched for
these factors.
When analyzed separately in patients with HD and
NHL, we observed similar CD4 counts at baseline (375
cells/mm3 [interquartile range, 131-545 cells/mm3] vs
245 cells/mm3 [interquartile range, 114-388 cells/mm3],
respectively; P 5 .258); however, patients with HD experienced higher CD4 recovery than patients with NHL at
the last available visit (P 5 .003). This difference may be
explained by a more significant T-cell impairment in
patients with NHL both because of the different pathogenesis of these lymphomas and because of the different CT
regimens. Usually, NHL occurs when the patient is
severely immunosuppressed,40 whereas HD can occur at
higher CD4 levels41; and some subtypes of NHL, such as
Burkitt lymphoma, require high-dose CT.26,27,29 These
conditions may explain the lower immune recovery in
patients with NHL than in patients with HD.
Among the patients with NHL, immune recovery
was not impaired by histologic type (DLBCL or Burkitt
lymphoma) or by the receipt of rituximab. Patients who
received rituximab presented with higher proportions of
clinical events compared with patients who did not receive
rituximab, although this difference was not significant,
probably because of the small number of patients.
VS was also observed according to the histologic
type of lymphoma (HD and NHL). It is noteworthy that,
among the patients with NHL, the VS proportion
increased significantly during follow-up (Ptrend < .0001),
which differed from patients with HD (Ptrend 5 .735),
probably because patients with NHL had a lower proportion of VS at baseline than patients with HD (24% vs
40%). When we compared VS between patients with HD
and NHL versus their respective controls, we observed a
significant difference in the proportion of VS between
patients with HD and their respective controls (P 5 .004)
but no difference in the proportion of VS among patients
with NHL and their respective controls. Patients who had
HD did not experience significant VS during follow-up,
maybe because of their longer antiretroviral exposure,
which may limit the availability of efficacious antiretroviral treatment, compared with patients who had NHL.
Some limitations of our study need to be mentioned.
First, there is the retrospective nature of this study, which
limited our control over the previously collected data; our
patients were predominantly men; thus, our results may
be generalized only to a predominantly male HIVinfected population. Moreover, only patients who were
alive at the time of data cutoff were included as cases;
2717

Original Article

therefore, data on immunovirologic parameters and clinical events were available only for a subgroup of all patients
who were diagnosed with lymphoma and received CT,
and we excluded all patients who died before the date of
data cutoff, independent of the length of their follow-up
after a diagnosis of lymphoma. Another limitation is that
potential residual confounding factors, other than the
diagnosis or treatment of lymphoma, may explain our
results, such as the more intensive care of patients with
HIV and better patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The small number of cases also is a limitation; in particular, the study included only 20 patients with HD.
Finally, just few patients reached a follow-up >10 years:
the median follow-up was 4.6 years for cases and of 4.8
years for controls.
In conclusion, HIV-infected lymphoma survivors
reached similar long-term immunologic recovery and viral
suppression compared with HIV-infected patients without lymphoma despite experiencing more clinical events,
especially during the first year of follow-up. Although
these results confirm the necessity of strict follow-up and
patient care, especially during the first year after lymphoma diagnosis, conversely, they provide helpful information to reassure clinicians and patients about the longterm outcome of HIV-infected lymphoma survivors.
