ABSTRACT
Diversity within the p53 transcriptional network can arise from a matrix of
changes that include target response element sequences and p53 expression level
variations. We previously found that wild type p53 (WT p53) can regulate expression
of most innate immune-related Toll-like-receptor genes (TLRs) in human cells, thereby
affecting immune responses. Since many tumor-associated p53 mutants exhibit
change-of-spectrum transactivation from various p53 targets, we examined the ability
of twenty-five p53 mutants to activate endogenous expression of the TLR gene family
in p53 null human cancer cell lines following transfection with p53 mutant expression
vectors. While many mutants retained the ability to drive TLR expression at WT levels,
others exhibited null, limited, or change-of-spectrum transactivation of TLR genes.
Using TLR3 signaling as a model, we show that some cancer-associated p53 mutants
amplify cytokine, chemokine and apoptotic responses after stimulation by the cognate
ligand poly(I:C). Furthermore, restoration of WT p53 activity for loss-of-function p53
mutants by the p53 reactivating drug RITA restored p53 regulation of TLR3 gene
expression and enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis via TLR3 signaling. Overall,
our findings have many implications for understanding the impact of WT and mutant
p53 in immunological responses and cancer therapy.

p53 targets, thereby altering subsequent cellular responses
such as DNA repair, genome stability and programmed
cell death that facilitates tumorigenesis [4, 6, 8]. Since
many tumors express mutant p53, there is a large effort
to identify small molecules, such as RITA [9], that restore
p53 tumor suppressor functions in tumor cells harboring
mutant p53.
Genome-wide
analyses
using
chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next generation
DNA sequencing and expression profiling have increased
the list of validated p53-regulated genes beyond just
regulation of cell cycle and cell fate that respond to
cellular and genotoxic stresses. Several additional
cellular processes that are also important to p53 tumor
suppressor activities [10-12] have been revealed including
genes involved in stem cell maintenance, restriction of
invasion and metastasis, metabolism, autophagy and

INTRODUCTION
The tumor suppressor p53 is a sequence-dependent
transcription factor that is critical for several signaling
events in response to a variety of stress signals. Once
activated, p53 orchestrates expression of many genes that
regulate transient cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair
and cell death, which all aid in tumor suppression [1]. The
importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor is demonstrated
by the fact that TP53 gene mutations are the most frequent
somatic events in cancers [2, 3]. Most cancer-associated
p53 mutations are missense and mostly located in the DNA
binding domain of the protein, affecting its transcription
factor activities. Among the different mutations that have
been associated with cancer, approximately one-third
retain transactivation capability [4-7]. Many of these can
result in a change-of-spectrum transactivation of various

communication within the tumor microenvironment
including immune responses [13]. Recent studies have
emphasized the role of p53 in influencing and modulating
the human immune system against tumors [14, 15]. For
example, DNA damage can trigger p53 responses that
help orchestrate clearance of damaged cells via the innate
immune system [16, 17].
The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in
host defense against invading pathogens, mediating
immediate and early host defense responses as well as
orchestrating adaptive immune responses. TLRs are
membrane glycoproteins that function as primary sensors
of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS)
from viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. The human
TLR gene family consists of ten genes, TLR1 to TLR10,
and each TLR recognizes distinct PAMPs. For example,
TLR4 on the cell surface detects gram-negative bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and TLR3 located in endosome
vesicles recognizes viral dsRNA [18]. After ligand
activation, TLRs orchestrate downstream signaling
pathways involving adaptor proteins, protein kinases
and effector transcription factors that ultimately induce
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators including
cytokines, chemokines and interferons [19, 20]. TLRs are
required not only for the organization of innate responses
to pathogens but also for optimal activation of the immune
system against cancer [21]. Since TLRs also can modulate
adaptive immune responses, there has been an emphasis
on TLR-based therapeutic approaches that enhance the
efficiency of anticancer immunotherapies [22]. However,
there have been conflicting reports concerning the pro- or
antitumoral role of several TLRs [18].
Recently, our lab and others identified TLR human
gene family members as p53 targets and responsive
to chromosomal stress. We also established that this
responsiveness is not available in rodents. Exposure of
various human immune-related primary cells as well as
cancer-derived cells to common anticancer agents led to
p53-dependent modulation of most TLR genes resulting in
a synergistic increase of downstream responses to cognate
ligands for the TLR2, TLR3 and TLR5 [23-26]. Previously,
we described a small number of tumor-associated p53
mutants that when transiently expressed in human cancer
cells dramatically influenced the expression of some TLR
genes [25]. However, the impact of those p53 mutations
on downstream TLR signaling was not elucidated, nor was
the effect of stress conditions.
Based on our previous results, we anticipated that
p53 mutations might alter the p53 responsiveness of
immune pathways so that a combination of immune ligand
along with chemotherapeutically induced p53 might
alter inflammatory and immune type responses against
tumors. Here, we have addressed the consequences of p53
mutants identified in human cancers on challenges to the
TLR component of the immune system. We investigated

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the impact of twenty-five cancer-associated p53 mutants
on expression of the TLR gene family. Using the TLR3
pathway as proof-of-principle, we examined the impact
of the p53 mutants on downstream immune signaling in
response to a TLR3 cognate ligand and chemotherapeutic
drugs. Since TLR3 along with its downstream signaling
responses have anti-cancer properties including immunemediated tumor growth suppression and a direct apoptotic
effect on TLR3 expressing cancer cells [27-30], TLR3 is
currently being investigated for therapeutic interventions
in cancer treatment [21, 31]. We found that p53 mutants
that retain the ability to transactivate TLR3, can be used
together with the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic
acid (poly(I:C) to alter immune responses mediated by
this receptor and subsequently increase TLR3-mediated
apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the functional
recovery of p53 activity with the reactivating drug RITA
can restore p53 responsiveness of TLR3 gene expression
including enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis via
TLR3 poly(I:C) signaling.

RESULTS
p53 mutants can differentially modify expression
of the TLR gene family
Previously, we had established that WT p53 can
modify responsiveness of most TLRs in several human
cancer cell lines in a tissue-dependent manner [25]. Since
p53 mutants vary in their ability to induce transactivation
from p53 targets, we assessed the potential for p53 mutant
proteins expressed from vectors to modulate expression
of endogenous TLR genes in two human cancer cell lines
that are p53 null. A total of 25 different p53 mutants
including 21 that are cancer-associated were evaluated
(Supplementary Table S1). The mRNA levels expressed
from the various TLRs were evaluated approximately 24 h
after transfection, as described in the heat map in Figure 1.
Transient expression of WT p53 in SaOS2
osteosarcoma cells resulted in induction of 7 of the 10
TLR genes, while in HCT116 colon cells expression was
significantly increased for only 4 genes. The responses
of the established p53 target gene p21(CDKN1A) and the
nontarget beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) gene were included
as controls. Consistent with our previous findings, TLR8
mRNA was not detected in either cell type while TLR4
was only expressed in SaOS2 cells [25].
When compared to the expression profile induced
by WT p53, several p53 mutants (S121F, P151H, H178Y,
G279R) retain the ability to induce or repress at similar
levels the expression of at least one TLR gene, while
another group that included T125R, M133T, A138V,
P190L, V272L, C277W and R337H exhibited a limited
transactivation potential as well as change-of-spectrum of
TLR genes expressed. Cell line-specific expression patterns

p53 mutants can enhance TLR3 induced immune
and apoptotic responses

were also observed, as for the case of TLR9. In HCT116,
expression of WT p53 and several mutants resulted in
a reduced TLR9 expression while in SaOS2 there was
increased expression, suggesting the involvement of cell
specific co-regulatory factors. The loss-of-function group
of mutants R175H, G245D, G245S, R273C and G279E
(depicted in blue in the Figure 1) did not induce any
TLR genes in either cell line, excluding the possibility of
gain-of-function activity [32] for these mutants towards
some genes. For p21 expression, the mutants showed
various transactivation profiles, supporting the diversity
in transactivation activities by p53 mutants. Thus, several
tumor-associated p53 mutants that retain transcriptional
activities can modulate the innate immune response.

We hypothesized that some of the p53 mutants
could also influence the downstream signaling mediated
by TLRs in response to their cognate ligands, as described
previously for WT p53 [24-26]. We identified a group of
p53 mutants that changed the pattern of TLR expressed
genes relative to WT p53 in at least one of the two cell
lines evaluated. For example, a group of p53 mutants
that included M133T, A138V, P190L and C277W have
decreased ability to drive the expression of TLR3, while
the activity of the other p53 variants towards TLR3 such
as P151H, H178Y, G279R and R337H was similar to WT
p53 (Figure 1). Our subsequent studies reported here focus

on the p53/TLR3 interactions as a model for other possible
studies on p53/TLR relationships.
As shown in Figure 2A-2B, changes in TLR3 gene
expression (Figure 2A) correlate well with differential p53
binding in the promoter region of this gene based on ChIP
assays (Figure 2B) following expression of some of the
above p53 mutants. Similar to WT p53, the p53 mutants
P151H, H178Y, G279R and R337H, but not A138V,
bound the TLR3 p53 response element located in the
promoter region (Figure 2B) and enhanced TLR3 mRNA
levels (Figure 2A). Binding by these mutant proteins was
also observed at the p53 RE associated with p21 although
there were relative differences, as for A138V and H178Y,
suggesting that p53 mutants can have different specificities
for p53 binding sequences. No binding was observed
at the promoter region of the negative control GAPDH
(Supplementary Figure S1). The increase in TLR3 and p21

mRNA levels induced by these p53 mutants corresponded
to increases in these proteins (Figure 2C). The loss-offunction mutants R175H and G245S, which are unable to
interact with canonical p53 binding sequences or induce
TLR3 expression, were used as negative controls in these
experiments and showed no binding to the TLR3 promoter
region or increased TLR3 mRNA levels, as expected.
We also confirmed that P151H and R337H positively
regulated TLR3 expression in a luciferase reporter assay
using the promoter region of TLR3, which contains a
validated binding site for p53 [23]. Like WT p53, the
expression in HCT116 p53-/- cells of P151H and R337H
mutants, but not A138V, induced reporter gene expression,
as shown in Figure 2D. The p21 reporter responses were
also consistent with altered binding and transactivation
spectra of the A138V, P151H and R337H mutants. Taken
together, p53 mutants proficient for binding to the TLR3

are associated with differential p53 mutant binding in the promoter region of this gene. Similar to WT p53, the p53 mutants P151H and

promoter can activate TLR3 transcription and protein
expression in a manner that can be unique to each mutant
and not a simple overall modulation of the WT p53
response.
TLR3 can directly trigger apoptosis in human cancer
cells in response to the double-strand RNA synthetic
agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) [28,
29], which is a mimic for viral double-stranded RNA
that triggers an innate immune response following viral
infection. In response to poly(I:C), TLR3 induces a type
I interferon (IFN) along with inflammatory cytokine/
chemokines. We reasoned that the combination of
poly(I:C) and TLR3 downstream signaling would
provide a model system for directly addressing the
influence that p53 mutants might have on potential TLR
signaling. We examined the effect of the p53 mutants on
poly(I:C) stimulation of expression of several downstream
inflammatory genes in HCT116 p53-/- cells transfected
with the change-of-spectrum p53 mutants. Although TLR3
expression could be increased by WT p53 and some of the
mutants (P151H and R337H), the levels were not further
increased by poly(I:C) (Figure 3A). In HCT116 p53 null

cells the basal levels of TLR3 are 50% less than in the
HCT116 p53+/+ cells [23]. Transient transfection with
WT and plasmids expressing mutant p53 had no apparent
influence on the expression of the IL-8 (CXCL8), IFN-β
(IFNB1) and IL-6, nor did poly(I:C) (3h) on parental
p53-/- cells or those transfected with the empty vector.
However, like the WT p53, some of the p53 mutants could
dramatically increase the poly(I:C) induced levels of IL-8,
IFN-β and IL-6 mRNA. In cells expressing WT p53 and
mutants P151H and R377H a significant induction of IL-8,
IFN-β and IL-6 mRNA levels was observed after poly(I:C)
treatment, whereas only a slight induction of cytokines
resulted with A138V and G245S mutants (Figure 3A).
Treatment with poly(I:C) had no impact on WT or p53
mutant mediated expression of the p53 target genes p21
and PUMA (BBC3) (Supplementary Figure S2). The
stimulatory impact that TLR3 expression driven by p53
mutants has on the TLR3 response to poly(I:C) was also
observed for secretion of the proapoptotic cytokine IL-6
as determined by ELISA (Figure 3B). Overall, our results
show that some p53 mutants can synergistically enhance
TLR3 induced immune responses.

Activation of TLR3 signaling by its agonists
can induce apoptosis in human cancer cells [29, 33].
Based on the above results, we asked whether the p53
mutants that increased TLR3 levels and downstream
inflammatory responses also enhanced the poly(I:C)
apoptotic response. As shown in Figure 4A, 24h
exposure to poly(I:C) significantly increased the
incidence of apoptosis in P151H and R337H expressing
cells, as indicated by Annexin V staining, similar to
WT p53. There was no increase for the A138V and
G245S transfected cells. The impact of poly(I:C) on
cell survival in p53 mutant expressing cells was also
confirmed with a MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) based assay. The
levels of cell death induced by WT p53, P151H and
R337H in the presence of poly(I:C) were comparable

to those detected in the isogenic HCT116 p53+/+ cells
treated with poly(I:C) (Supplementary Figure S3A).
Apoptosis in the p53 mutant expressing cells in response
to poly(I:C) was dependent on caspase activity since
the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented the
appearance of apoptotic cells (Supplementary Figure
S3B). Furthermore, the poly(I:C) induced cell death
in mutant p53 cells was significantly enhanced by
co-treatment with the anticancer drug DXR (Figure
4B) when compared with either treatment alone.
Overall, these data support the view that altering the
TLR3 pathway, including increased TLR3 levels and
downstream ligand induced activation, can potentially be
exploited for cancer treatments utilizing existing mutants
or WT p53 in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs.

Functional reactivation of p53 mutants
modulates TLR3 induced downstream signaling

PUMA, based on qPCR measurements at 24 after their
addition to cell cultures, similar to previous reports for
other p53 mutants [36, 37]. However, only RITA increased
TLR3 expression. Although DXR and 5FU can activate
WT p53 and even some change-of-spectrum mutants (see
Figure 4B), neither DXR nor 5FU treatment alone affected
TLR3 expression in the RAJI cells. Yet, the combination
of RITA, but not PRIMA, with DXR or 5FU led to a
considerable increase in TLR3, p21 and PUMA expression
(Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure S4), suggesting
different mechanisms for restoring function and its
potential transcriptional targets. To exclude the possibility
that TLR3 was induced through p53-independent
pathways activated after p53 mutant reactivation, we
incubated the cells prior to RITA treatment with the p53specific inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α) [38]. Treatment
with PFT-α reduced TLR3 as well as P21 and PUMA
mRNA expression to baseline levels, demonstrating the
direct involvement of the p53 pathway (Figure 5B and
Supplementary Figure S4) in the RITA and RITA+DXR or
RITA+5FU treated cells. The increases in expression are
reflected in p53 protein occupancy at the TLR3 promoter

Although p53 change-of-spectrum mutants can
impact TLR expression and signaling, their frequency in
tumors is low when compared with classical p53 hotspot
mutants, which have lost the ability to interact with p53
binding sequences. As expected, these loss-of-function
hotspot mutants do not influence TLR gene family
expression (Figures 1 and 2A). We, therefore, investigated
whether functional reactivation of endogenous loss-offunction mutants can restore p53-induced expression of
TLR3 in several cancer cell lines carrying such p53 altered
alleles. The cell line RAJI, which harbors the loss-offunction mutant alleles R213Q and Y234H [34-36] for p53
targets including TLR3 and p21 (Supplementary Figure
S4A), was treated with the reactivating drugs RITA [36]
and PRIMA-1 [37] as well as with the anticancer drugs
doxorubicin (DXR) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) to induce
p53.
As shown in Figure 5A, RITA and PRIMA-1
increased the expression of the p53 targets p21 and

cells were treated for 24h with p53 reactivating drugs RITA (1 μM) or PRIMA-1 (10 μM) or the chemotherapeutic agents DXR (0.5 μM)

(Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S4) and an increase
in TLR3 protein (Figure 5D). RITA treatment also rescued
the expression of TLR3, p21 and PUMA in other cancer
cells harboring hotspot p53 mutations including R175H,
R273H and R280K (Supplementary Figure S5A), although
in two of the cells lines RITA treatment alone resulted in
massive cell death (Supplementary Figure S5B).
Since there was significant restoration of TLR3
expression in RAJI cells after co-treatment with RITA
and DNA damaging agents, we determined the effect of
p53 mutant rescue by RITA on immune and apoptotic
responses in RAJI cells following incubation with the
TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). RITA, DXR and 5FU alone had
no or just a few-fold effect on mRNA expression of IFN-α,
IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, as shown in Figure 6A-6E.
However, treatment with RITA led to a substantial increase
in the downstream effect of poly(I:C) consistent with an
impact of restored p53 on TLR3 expression. Both DXR
and 5FU increased poly(I:C) signaling for some of the
cytokines and this was generally additive with the effect

of RITA. 5FU. The effects on apoptosis were somewhat
similar. As shown in Figure 6F, both RITA and DXR alone
could increase the level of apoptosis approximately 2-3
fold, and this was increased by the addition of poly(I:C).
A further, nearly additive increase was observed with
the combination of poly(I:C) and RITA+DXR, reaching
approximately 80% apoptosis in 24 hr. Similar results
were found with poly(I:C) and RITA+5FU. Together, these
results show that functional restoration of endogenous
p53 mutants can increase TLR3 expression and synergize
with DNA damaging agents to modulate TLR3 signaling
responses in the presence of a cognate ligand.

DISCUSSION
Crosstalk between tumor cells and cells of the
microenvironment is crucial for regulating tumorigenesis
[39]. Although the function of p53 as a barrier to cancer
development has been extensively examined, recent

Reactivation of mutant p53 in RAJI cells by RITA can increase interferon and cytokine responses to the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). This can be
increased further by DXR and to a lesser extent by 5FU. Twenty four h after drug treatment, RAJI cells were incubated for an additional 3
h with or without poly(I:C) (5 μg/mL). Gene expression was assessed by qPCR. F. Combination of RITA with anticancer drugs enhanced

studies have shown non-cell-autonomous effects of p53
in stimulating an anti-tumorigenic microenvironment [10].
For example, Xue et al. [40] found that p53-dependent
tumor regression in a mouse liver carcinoma model was
related to induction of a senescence program through
the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
activation of innate immune response, characterized by
the recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and natural
killer (NK) cells. This senescence-associated phenotype
identified with secretion of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and
chemokines can be restrained or qualitatively modified
by p53 in several cell types in mouse [39, 41]. Moreover,
gene expression analyses has shown that p53 directly
induces numerous genes involved in triggering the
recruitment of immune cells and immune surveillance in
human cells [11], which can involve the TLR gene family.
Besides the canonical pathogen protection
functions of TLRs, they are also expressed in many
cancer epithelial cells and can affect tumor growth
[18]. In addition, TLRs are activated by a wide array of
endogenous molecules released from self-cells following
tissue damage (known as damage-associated molecular
pattern, DAMP) such as hyaluronic acid and molecules
derived from necrotic and apoptotic cells including
nucleic acids [42]. Many DAMPS are generated by
cancer cells in response to chemotherapeutic drugs such
as DXR and cyclophosphamide [43]. The interpretation
of such signals by innate immune responding cells such
as macrophages or dendritic cells can stimulate tumorspecific immune responses that in some settings enhance
anticancer therapy. TLR antagonists as well as agonists of
their negative regulators are now being developed for the
treatment of cancer, allergies and viral infections and as
vaccine adjuvants to enhance immune responses against
tumors and infectious diseases [44, 45].
Since p53 can directly influence expression of the
TLR gene family and downstream immune/inflammatory
responses [24-26], understanding the relationship between
p53 and its mutants with the immune system is expected
to be important for addressing tumor progression and
therapeutic approaches, especially since many therapies
result in DNA damage and induction of available p53.
Here, we showed differences in the TLR responsiveness
to tumor-associated p53 mutants. In addition to loss or
simple reduction, some mutants resulted in a change-inspectrum with regards to induction of individual TLR
genes. These results suggest differences in opportunities
to exploit p53 mutant status in p53 mediated immune
responses, especially if p53 could be reactivated.
Using TLR3 and the poly(I:C) agonist as a model,
we have shown how p53 mutants can vary in their
influence on immune and apoptotic signaling mediated by
this receptor in response to a ligand, with some mutants
retaining a strong p53 mediated enhancement of ligand
responsiveness. The immune response stimulated via
TLR3 has been proposed for development of anticancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapies, and several poly(I:C) derived agonists of TLR3
are under clinical investigation [31, 46]. In addition,
TLR3 has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis
in response to genotoxic stresses or immune challenges.
For example, Paone et al., [28] showed that poly(I:C)
treatment induced TLR3 dependent apoptosis in human
prostate cancer cells. Particularly relevant to the current
findings was that cell lines with mutant p53 were less
responsive. Moreover, Taura et al. [29] reported that
anticancer drugs including 5FU, cisplatin, etoposide, and
interferons could increase poly(I:C)-induced cell death in
HCT116 cells that are WT p53. Based on our findings,
we speculate that treatment with poly(I:C) agonists alone
or in the presence of traditional chemotherapeutic agents
may be more effective in patients with tumors that have
TLR3-enhancing p53 mutants, such as P151H and R337H
compared to A138V and G245S p53 mutants (that have
no effect on TLR3 responses). Additionally, the use of
poly(I:C) agonists may be best for types of cancer that
have a high incidence of TLR3-enhancing p53 mutants
like the R337H mutation, that has been identified in
subjects with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome with pediatric
adrenal cortical carcinoma, which has a significantly
increased frequency in Brazil [47]. Thus, knowing the p53
mutation status of tumor cells could be used to predict the
responsiveness of cancer patients to poly(I:C) agonists in
the clinic.
Based on our TLR3 results, expression profiling of
other TLR gene family members in response to cancerrelated p53 mutants (Figure 1) may open additional
strategies for their use in therapies. We recently
demonstrated that Nutlin, an activator of WT p53
functions, can greatly enhance the TLR5 downstream
mediated responses to its natural ligand flagellin [26].
Among the mutants evaluated in the present study, P151H,
H178Y and P190L resulted in increased TLR5 expression,
whereas the M133T mutant down-regulated expression.
Since most of the commonly found p53 mutations
are loss-of-function, pharmacological restoration of
p53 function is an obvious therapeutic strategy against
human cancers. Over the past decade, several small
molecules have been identified that inactivate mutant
p53 or restore WT p53 response in mutant p53 protein
including PRIMA-1, MIRA-1, Elipticin, CDB3,
WR1065, NSC319726, p53R3 and CP-31398, although
their mechanisms of action in many cases remain to be
clarified [9]. In particular, RITA was found to suppress
growth of cancer cell lines carrying various p53 mutations
and restored the transcriptional functions of several
p53 mutant alleles including R175H, R213Q, Y234H,
R248W, R273H and R280K that resulted in induction of
apoptosis [36, 48]. Here, we found that RITA rescued p53induced TLR3 expression in RAJI cells, which carry two
nonfunctional p53 mutant alleles (R213Q and Y234H).
In the present study, we establish a new role for RITA.
It synergizes with DNA damaging drugs to increase

TLR3 expression, enhancing its immune and apoptotic
responses mediated by to its agonist poly(I:C). Without
functional reactivation of the p53 altered alleles in RAJI
cells, treatment with DXR or 5FU alone has no significant
effect on TLR3 expression or impact on its downstream
signaling. The combination of reactivation of p53 along
with enhancement of target TLR genes and exposure
to appropriate TLR agonists suggests unique immune
approaches to the development of anti-cancer drugs and
drug combinations based on immune responses via the
TLR gene family [14].
A profile of TLR gene expression patterns in
specific tumors in response to p53 and DNA damaging
agents combined with knowledge of p53 expression and
mutation status in these tumors can be an important tool in
cancer diagnosis and in strategies that target TLR pathway
for human cancer therapy. We note that while rodents
have served as excellent models systems for addressing
p53 functions the lack of direct p53 responsiveness
of the mouse TLR gene family precludes their use in
developing human therapies based on p53 modulation of
TLR responses [24]. Given the diversity of p53 mutants
in human cancers, it would be useful to understand
the overall matrix that dictates immune responses
mediated by the family of TLR proteins within the tumor
microenvironment, consequences of various agonists and
the impact of specific p53 mutant or WT proteins [14]
following p53 activating treatments. When combined
with information about p53 status and functionality, we
propose that the impact of p53 activation could be additive
or even synergistic in TLR targeted cancer chemotherapy.
However, manipulation of TLR signaling in the context of
cancer must be done judiciously, especially with regard
to the effect of TLR activation on tumor cells as well as
the tumor microenvironment [49]. Choices of TLR targets
would be tumor specific and depend on p53 WT or mutant
status. Furthermore, downstream aspects of TLR and
p53 pathways have important therapeutic implications,
since many of the deleterious side effects of genotoxic
chemotherapies could actually result from chemoresistance
arising from p53 mutations [50]. Strategies that overcome
these effects without compromising normal p53 tumor
suppressor function in the rest of the body would be
valuable for cancer therapy [51].

5A supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All cell
cultures were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells
were plated 18-24h before being treated with Doxorubicin
(DXR, 1μM), 5-Fluorouracil (5FU, 300μM, Sigma, St
Louis, MO), RITA (1μM), or PRIMA-1MET (10μM,
Cayman chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). The TLR3 agonist
poly(I:C) was from Invivogen (San Diego, CA) and was
used at 5 μg/mL. Where indicated, cells were pretreated
with 10 μM pifithrin-α or 20 μM pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-fmk (Sigma) 3 and 2 h, respectively, prior to p53
reactivation or drug treatment.

Plasmid constructs
WT p53 expression vector pC53-SN3 and WWPLuc (p21/WAF1 promoter; Addgene plasmid # 16451)
were a gift from B. Vogelstein. All of the p53 pointmutant constructs described in the text were derived from
pC53-SN3 vector and prepared using the QuikChange II
XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
TLR3 promoter:luc reporter plasmid was constructed
in pGL3 Basic:luciferase vector (Promega, Madison,
WI) as described in reference [23]. Sequences of all the
constructs developed for this study were confirmed by
DNA sequencing.

Transfections and luciferase assays
Transient transfections with p53 mutants were
carried out using FuGENE 6 reagent (Promega), according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were
plated in 6-well plates and transfected in triplicate with
1μg of p53 expression constructs. After 24 h, cells were
harvested. For luciferase assays, p53-/- HCT116 cells
seeded into 12-well plates were transfected with 0.25 μg
of the luciferase reporter vector together with 50ng of p53
expression vector; 25 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase
plasmid (Promega) was used as a transfection efficiency
control. Luciferase activities were measured 48 h posttransfection with a Synergy2 Multi-mode Microplate
reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, using the
dual-luciferase assay system (Promega), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Relative luciferase activity for
each construct was defined as the mean value of the firefly
luciferase/Renilla luciferase ratios obtained from three
independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.

cytometry using the Annexin V/PI assay (BD, Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol using BD LSRII
(BD, Biosciences) equipment. Data were collected on
10,000 cells. Apoptotic fractions were determined where
cells positive for Annexin V staining but not propidium
iodide were counted.

Cellular proliferation assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 2,000 cells/
well, in 100 μL of medium and incubated for 24 h. The
next day, cells were exposed to the indicated drugs for the
indicated times. Following treatments, the CellTiter 96
One Solution assay (Promega) was used to measure cell
proliferation status, per manufacturer's instructions. Optical
densities were measured using a Synergy2 Multi-mode
Microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Triplicate wells
were assayed for each condition.

Real time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit in the presence of DNAse (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA). Complementary DNAs (cDNA) were
generated from 1 μg of purified RNA using TaqMan
reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA); then, TaqMan RT-PCR was performed with the
HT7900 system (Applied Biosystems) using TLRs, p21
and B2M pre-validated primers, as described in [24-26].

Statistics
Data were graphed and analyzed with Graphpad
Prism6 software. The data presented correspond to the
mean ± SD of at least three experiments where each was
done in triplicate. Statistically significant differences were
identified using two way ANOVA. p-values < 0.001 were
considered statistically significant.

Cytokine measurement
