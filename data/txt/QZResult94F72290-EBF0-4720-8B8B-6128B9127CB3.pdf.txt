Abstract

Author Manuscript

The study of cancer genes in mouse models has traditionally relied on genetically-engineered
strains made via transgenesis or gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells1. Here we describe a
new method of cancer model generation using the CRISPR/Cas system in vivo in wild-type mice.
We have used hydrodynamic injection to deliver a CRISPR plasmid DNA expressing Cas9 and
single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)2–4 to the liver and directly target the tumor suppressor genes Pten5
and p536, alone and in combination. CRISPR-mediated Pten mutation led to elevated Akt
phosphorylation and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, phenocopying the effects of deletion of the
gene using Cre-LoxP technology7, 8. Simultaneous targeting of Pten and p53 induced liver tumors
that mimicked those caused by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of Pten and p53. DNA sequencing of
liver and tumor tissue revealed insertion or deletion (indel) mutations of the tumor suppressor

genes, including bi-allelic mutations of both Pten and p53 in tumors. Furthermore, co-injection of
Cas9 plasmids harboring sgRNAs targeting the β-Catenin gene (Ctnnb1) and a single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide donor carrying activating point mutations led to the generation of
hepatocytes with nuclear localization of β-Catenin. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
direct mutation of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in the liver using the CRISPR/Cas
system, which presents a new avenue for rapid development of liver cancer models and functional
genomics.

The prokaryotic type II CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools have been successfully applied in
many organisms, including mouse and human cells2, 4, 9–11. The system offers sequencespecific direct editing of DNA; therefore, this method can achieve complete loss-of-function
compared to RNAi-based approaches12. In rodent and primate ES cells or zygotes, CRISPR
has been applied to efficiently generate mutant alleles or reporter genes13–19. Our groups
have previously shown that in vivo delivery of CRISPR can repair a disease gene in mouse
liver20. However, generation of somatic cancer mutations in adult animals using CRISPR
has not been reported.

To investigate the potential of the CRISPR system to directly induce loss-of-function
mutations in vivo, we chose to target the tumor suppressor gene Pten, which is a negative
regulator of the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway5. Mutation and genomic loss of Pten has been
identified in many types of human cancer5. Liver-specific knockout of Pten in mice induces
lipid accumulation and late-onset liver cancer7, 8. We cloned a pX330 vector9 co-expressing
an sgRNA targeting Pten (Pten target sequence 1 in Supplementary Table 1, termed sgPten)
and Cas9. We first showed that sgPten could induce Pten mutations in mouse 3T3 cells
following transfection (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 5). To deliver
CRISPR to the liver in adult mice, we employed hydrodynamic tail vein injection (Fig. 1a),
which can deliver DNA to ~20% of hepatocytes for transient expression21. As shown in
Figure 1b, hydrodynamic injection of a luciferase plasmid DNA resulted in liver-specific
expression of luciferase in mice. We next injected a cohort of wild-type FVB mice with
sgPten and an equal number with a pX330 plasmid encoding an sgRNA targeting GFP
(sgGFP) as a control. In parallel, we genetically deleted Pten in the liver of Pten floxed
mice8 (Ptenfl/fl) via tail vein injection of adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase (adenoCre). Two weeks later, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of liver sections from five of
the sgPten-treated mice using a Pten-specific antibody revealed 3.3±0.5% hepatocytes with
negative Pten staining, surrounded by Pten-positive cells (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig.
2a–c). Importantly, the liver is composed of a mixture of diploid and polyploidy
hepatocytes, and we cannot determine the ploidy of the Pten-deficient cells. Thus, they may
be a mixture of cells with two or more mutated Pten alleles. A lower percentage (0.4±0.1%)
of hepatocytes showed intermediate Pten staining (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2c),
potentially indicating heterozygous Pten mutation in diploid cells or incomplete mutation in
polyploid cells. Coincident with negative Pten staining, we detected elevated staining of
phospho-Akt, a biomarker of the PI3K pathway activity, in sgPten-treated (n=5) and adenoCre injected Ptenfl/fl mice (n=5) (Fig. 1c lower panel and Extended Data Fig. 2d).
Histological analysis and Oil Red staining at two months showed hepatocytes with lipid
accumulation in sgPten-treated FVB mice (n=5) and adeno-Cre treated Ptenfl/fl mice

(Extended Data Fig. 3), which is a known phenotype associated with Pten mutation in the
liver7, 8. These data indicate that in vivo CRISPR-mediated genome editing was able to
generate Pten-negative cells in the liver, mimicking liver-specific conditional deletion of
Pten in mice.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that loss of Pten staining and function occurred due to CRISPR-mediated
mutation of Pten, we performed deep sequencing on the captured targeted region of Pten
locus of total liver genomic DNA. Sequencing revealed that 2.6±1.4% of the sequencing
reads harbored indels at the Pten locus in sgPten-treated mice (n=5) compared to 0.5±0.1%
in sgGFP-treated mice (n=3, p=0.02) (Fig. 1e). In the sgPten-treated livers, most of the
sequence variants were predicted to cause frameshift mutations as inferred from insertion
length and/or phase (Fig. 1f–g, Extended Data Fig. 4). For example, we observed frequent
occurrence of 1nt or 2nt indels, which would lead to disruption of the Pten reading frame
(Fig. 1f–h and Supplementary Table 4). These indels clustered at the predicted sgPteninduced Cas9 cutting site (Fig. 1h, Extended Data Fig. 4a), whereas the indels detected in
sgGFP samples distribute randomly at low frequency, likely due to background PCR errors
or sequencing errors (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Interestingly, in five independent mice, the
frequency of Pten loss scored by IHC (including both full and partial loss of signal) strongly
correlated with the frequency of Pten indels (Fig. 1i, R2=0.81). These data suggest that for
most cells, expression of the sgPten vector results in complete mutation of all Pten alleles
present in the cell. Because non-parenchymal cells (NPC) in the liver generally do not take
up DNA following hydrodynamic injection, it is not surprising that the indel frequency in
liver genomic DNA and the frequency of Pten-negative hepatocytes are not strictly equal.

Author Manuscript

To assess the long-term phenotype following sgPten treatment, we harvested livers from
three sgPten-treated mice at four months. As shown in Figure 2a, these livers exhibited
regions of hepatocytes with prominent lipid accumulation, loss of Pten and increased
phospho-Akt staining, which fully phenocopies Pten knockout mice7, 8. To address whether
sgPten induces p53 in hepatocytes, we performed p53 IHC on sgPten-treated liver sections
at 14 days and 4 months. sgPten liver sections did not stain positively for p53, despite
elevated phospho-Akt (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 5), suggesting that Pten loss does not
activate the p53 pathway in the liver at these timepoints. Given the long tumor latency of
liver tumors in Pten knockout mice (44–74 weeks)7, we were not surprised to find no tumors
in sgPten-treated mice at timepoints up to 4 months.

Author Manuscript

Recent studies identified that Cas9 can tolerate mismatches between sgRNA and genomic
DNA depending on the sgRNA sequence and position of mismatches9, 22. To characterize
potential off-target effect of sgPten in the liver, we identified top-ranking sgPten off-target
genomic sites in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig. 6a) using a published prediction
tool9. We amplified the Pten locus and the top three potential off-target sites from sgGFPand sgPten- treated livers and measured CRISPR editing using the Surveyor assay2. In the
sgPten-treated livers, the assay revealed 2.3±0.4% (n=2) indels at the Pten locus. In contrast,
we did not detect surveyor nuclease cutting at the assayed off-target sites (Extended Data
Fig. 6b), indicating that the frequency of off-target editing is below the limit of detection of
this assay. Deep sequencing of a sgPten-treated liver sample revealed that the indels

frequencies within 10nt regions around the top three predicted cutting sites were <0.1%
(Supplementary Table 6).

We next tested a nickase version of Cas9, Cas9D10A, which only makes single strand DNA
breaks and was reported to have further reduced levels of off-target effects23, 24. We
designed a pair of Pten sgRNAs (Fig. 2b) predicted to generate off-set single-stranded DNA
breaks24. The Cas9D10A plasmid and the two PCR products containing a U6 promoter
driving expression of offset Pten sgRNAs (termed sgPten2/3) were introduced into FVB
mice (n=5) by hydrodynamic injection. U6-sgGFP PCR DNA served as a control (n=5). By
deep sequencing of the liver genomic DNA isolated from two mice at two weeks post
injection, we observed 2.7±0.1% indels at the Pten locus in sgPten2/3-treated mice
compared to 0.2±0.2% in sgGFP-treated mice (n=2) (Fig. 2c,d, Extended Data Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Table 4). Pten-negative cells were observed in the sgPten2/3 livers
(2.8±0.4%) but not in sgGFP controls (0.0±0.0%) by IHC staining (Fig. 2e) (n=5).

To test whether CRISPR-mediated mutation can target other tumor suppressor genes in vivo,
we designed constructs to mutate p53 (also known as TP53 and Trp53), which is the most
frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer6. Exome sequencing studies
have identified frequent mutations of p53 and PTEN in human cholangiocarcinoma25. An
sgRNA construct targeting p53 was cloned into the pX330 plasmid (termed sgp53)26.
Transfection of sgp53 into 3T3 cells led to frequent p53 indels, as measured by deep
sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 5). We next injected a cohort of
FVB mice with sgp53 alone. These mice did not exhibit liver tumors at three months post
injection (Extended Data Fig. 8a), which is consistent with previous studies showing that
liver-specific p53 knockout mice develop liver tumors only after 14 months27. We also
performed deep sequencing of sgp53-treated livers at 14 days and detected 6.0±0.1% indels
at the p53 locus (Extended Data Fig. 8b and Supplementary Table 4), demonstrating that
sgp53 can directly generate mutations in p53 in the mouse liver.

Author Manuscript

In an effort to mutate two tumor suppressor genes simultaneously, we co-injected sgPten
and sgp53 into FVB mice (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figure 9, indels
were observed in total liver DNA isolated from two animals, at frequencies of 4.0±0.1% for
Pten and 6.4±0.1% for p53, enriched at the predicted cutting sites. At 3 months post
injection, all 5 mice co-injected with sgPten and sgp53 developed liver tumors with bile duct
differentiation features (Fig. 3c), while none of sgGFP-injected mice (n=5) developed
tumors. The tumors were positive for Cytokeratin 19, a marker of bilinear lineage cells27
(Fig. 3c). Ptenfl/fl;p53fl/fl conditional knockout mice (n=5) injected with Adeno-Cre also
developed liver tumors of similar histology at 3 months (Fig. 3c). When injected alone,
neither sgPten alone nor sgp53 caused any detectable tumors at this time point. Sequencing
of the sgPten- plus sgp53- induced liver tumors and tumor-derived cell lines (n=5 tumors
analyzed) showed bi-allelic mutations of both genes (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 7).
These results demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated mutation of Pten and p53 can induce liver
tumor development, supporting the use of multiplexed CRISPR editing of cancer genes, at
least in this tissue.

To determine whether CRISPR can be used to directly introduce gain-of-function mutations,
we targeted the Ctnnb1 gene, which encodes β-Catenin, a transcription factor in the WNT
pathway that is frequently mutated in liver cancer28. Phosphorylation of four serine/
threonine residues leads to degradation of β-Catenin (Fig. 4a)28. We co-injected FVB mice
with two pX330 plasmids carrying sgRNAs targeting Ctnnb1 (termed sgβ-Catenin) and a
200nt single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligo harboring four point mutations that cause serine/
threonine to alanine mutations (Fig. 4a) that have been shown to abolish phosphorylation
and cause stabilization and nuclear localization of β-Catenin28. In mice injected with either
sgβ-Catenin or ssDNA alone (n=5), β-Catenin was localized only at cell junctions as shown
by IHC (Fig. 4b,c). In contrast, in five mice injected with sgβ-Catenin and ssDNA, we
observed that ~0.5% of hepatocytes exhibited nuclear β-Catenin at 7 days post injection
(Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, accumulation of β-Catenin was associated with increased levels of
glutamine synthetase (GS), a β-Catenin target gene29 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 10a)
and reduced phospho-β-Catenin (Fig. 4d). In addition, we subjected the liver DNA from two
mice treated with this combination to deep sequencing. The data confirm that a small but
detectable percentage of sequencing reads contained the four “G” point mutations present in
the ssDNA (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 10b). sgβ-Catenin also generated indels
clustered at the predicted Cas9 cutting sites (Supplementary Table 8). These data
demonstrate that CRISPR system can be used to directly induce gain-of-function mutation
or other substitutions via homologous recombination in vivo20.

Our data illustrate the potential to directly disrupt tumor suppressor genes and generate point
mutations in oncogenes in adult mouse liver using the CRISPR/Cas system. This method
bypasses the need to engineer ES cells and to breed multiple mutant animals together to
generate compound mutants. This approach generated compound Pten and p53 indels at low
frequency but was sufficient to induce multifocal tumors. We anticipate that this method
will allow for more rapid testing of any single genes or gene combinations that are suspected
of being capable of initiating tumor formation in the liver. Given the number of candidate
cancer genes being discovered through NGS efforts, simplified methods of testing the
oncogenic properties of candidates in vivo are critical. To increase the sensitivity of the
assay, one could perform the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis on a “sensitized”
background carrying constitutive or conditional mutation in a tumor suppressor gene such as
p53. More efficient delivery techniques, such as adenovirus or adeno-associated virus (Ran
et al, submitted), more potent sgRNAs, and longer HR templates might also improve the
overall efficiency of this method and expand the range of tissue that could be targeted.
Consistent with recent studies showing long-term Cas9/sgRNA expression is not toxic in
cells26, hydrodynamic injection of Cas9/sgGFP in mice was well tolerated and did not
trigger weight loss in mice20. However, further studies are required to fully evaluate the side
effects of the CRISPR system in mice and other organisms. This study underscores the
power of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for rapid genome editing and the development of novel
cancer models in the mouse.

All animal study protocols were approved by the MIT Animal Care and Use Committee.
Cohorts of Ptenflox/flox and Ptenflox/flox;p53flox/flox mice were infected with 1×108 (Fig. 1) or
1×109 (Fig. 3) plaque-forming units (PFU) of Adeno-Cre (University of Iowa) in 100μl PBS
by intravenous injection. Vectors for hydrodynamic tail vein injection were prepared using
the EndoFreeMaxi Kit (Qiagen). For hydrodynamic liver injection, plasmid DNA suspended
in 2ml saline was injected via the tail vein in 5–7 seconds into 8 weeks old female FVB/NJ
mice (Jackson lab). No randomization or blinding was used. The amount of injected DNA
was 60μg for sgPten, 60μg each for sgPten+sgp53, 40μg Cas9D10A+2μg sgPten2 PCR+2μg
sgPten3 PCR for off-set sgRNA study, and 30μg sgβ-Catenin.1, 30μg sgβ-Catenin.2 and
60μg ssDNA for the β-Catenin experiment. An equal amount of sgGFP was used as a control
for each experiment. The Ptenflox/flox;p53flox/flox and sgPten+sgp53 mice were dosed with
CCl4 as in31.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

Mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Livers were fixed in 4% formalin
overnight, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) for pathology. Liver sections were de-waxed, rehydrated and stained using standard
immunohistochemistry protocols32. The following antibodies were used: anti-Pten (Cell
Signaling, 9559, 1:100), anti-pAkt S473 (Cell Signaling, 4060, 1:50), β-Catenin (BD,

(Abcam, ab133496, 1:100). The number of hepatocytes was quantified from >3 lowmagnification fields per mouse with 5 mice per group. Immunofluorescence was performed
as previously described32. β-Catenin (BD,610154) and phospho-β-Catenin (Abcam,
ab53050) antibodies were used. Slides were counterstained with 4, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). Images were obtained with a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal
microscope using a 40× APO Fluor objective (NA 0.65).

hours post transfection. Off-target sites were predicted using http://crispr.mit.edu/. For
surveyor assay, PCR products (Supplementary Table 3) were gel purified and treated with
Surveyor nuclease kit (Transgenomic). DNA was separated on 4–20% Novex TBE Gels
(Life Technologies) and stained with ethidium bromide. Quantization of surveyor bands was
as in9. For sequencing of liver tumors and matched tumor-derived cell lines, PCR products
of the Pten and p53 genomic regions were cloned using Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit
(Life Technologies) and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. One tumor from each animal was
analyzed.
Deep sequencing of CRISPR modified Pten and p53 loci

Author Manuscript

Genomic region of Pten and p53 was PCR amplified using Herculase II high-fidelity
polymerase and gel purified. Libraries were made from 50ng of the PCR products using the
Nextera protocol and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (150bp paired-end) and HiSeq2500
(100bp paired-end, β-Catenin samples) machines. Data were processed according to
standard Illumina sequencing analysis procedures. Briefly, reads were mapped to the PCR
amplicons as reference sequences using bwa with custom scripts33. Insertions and deletions
were called against reference using VarScan2. Indel phase was calculated as the length of
insertions or deletions modulus 3. The rate of β-Catenin donor integration was calculated as
donor allele frequency. Indel at Pten G304 exist at the same frequency across all samples,
thus possibly arise from PCR or sequencing errors, and was filtered out in final analysis.
Two to five biological replicates were sequenced for in vivo liver samples. One DNA sample
was sequenced for Pten and p53 in 3T3 cells and for Pten off-target sites in sgPten treated
liver. To compare the editing efficiency at Pten off-target sites, the indel frequency within
10nt regions (20nt total) flanking Pten A124, OT1 G209, OT2 G451, OT3 G265 was
calculated. Accession codes. BioProject: PRJNA252101

hydrodynamically injected into wild-type FVB mice to transiently express the CRISPR
components in hepatocytes. (b) Bioluminescence imaging of mice hydrodynamically
injected with a Luciferase plasmid (n=3). (c) Representative H&E and IHC staining of FVB
mice injected with sgGFP (as a control) or sgPten, and Ptenfl/fl mice injected with AdenoCre for 2 weeks. Note the hepatocytes with clear cytoplasm on H&E sections, indicating
lipid accumulation. Scale bars are 50μm. (d) Percentage of hepatocytes with negative or
intermediate Pten staining. Error bars are s.d. (n=5 mice). (e) Pten indel frequency in the
total liver genomic DNA (n=3 mice for sgGFP and n=5 mice for sgPten). (f-h)
