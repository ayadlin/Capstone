Abstract
We examined the effects of LJM716, an HER3 (ERBB3) neutralizing antibody that inhibits ligand-induced and
ligand-independent HER3 dimerization, as a single agent and in combination with BYL719, an ATP competitive
p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor, against HER2-overexpressing breast and gastric cancers. Treatment with LJM716
reduced HER2-HER3 and HER3-p85 dimers, P-HER3 and P-AKT, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with LJM716
alone markedly reduced growth of BT474 xenografts. The combination of LJM716/lapatinib/trastuzumab
signiﬁcantly improved survival of mice with BT474 xenografts compared with lapatinib/trastuzumab (P ¼
0.0012). LJM716 and BYL719 synergistically inhibited growth in a panel of HER2þ and PIK3CA mutant cell lines.
The combination also inhibited P-AKT in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and growth of HER2þ NCIN87 gastric cancer xenografts more potently than LJM716 or BYL719 alone. Trastuzumab-resistant HER2þ/
PIK3CA mutant MDA453 xenografts regressed completely after 3 weeks of therapy with LJM716 and BYL719,
whereas either single agent inhibited growth only partially. Finally, mice with BT474 xenografts treated with
trastuzumab/LJM716, trastuzumab/BYL719, LJM716/BYL719, or trastuzumab/LJM716/BYL719 exhibited similar
rates of tumor regression after 3 weeks of treatment. Thirty weeks after treatment discontinuation, 14% of mice
were treated with trastuzumab/LJM716/BYL719, whereas >80% in all other treatment groups were sacriﬁced due
to a recurrent large tumor burden (P ¼ 0.0066). These data suggest that dual blockade of the HER2 signaling
network with an HER3 antibody that inhibits HER2-HER3 dimers in combination with a p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor
in the absence of a direct HER2 antagonist is an effective treatment approach against HER2-overexpressing
cancers. Cancer Res; 73(19); 6013–23. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is an
important regulator in cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. PI3K is a major signaling hub downstream of HER2 and
other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) ampliﬁed in cancer cells.
PI3K activates AKT, SGK, PDK1, mTOR, and other signaling
molecules involved in cell-cycle progression and survival. PI3K
is arguably the most frequently somatically altered pathway in
cancer (1), with mutation and/or ampliﬁcation of the genes

encoding the PI3K catalytic subunits p110a (PIK3CA) and
p110b (PIK3CB), the PI3K regulatory subunit p85a (PIK3R1),
the PI3K effectors AKT1-3 and PDK1, RTKs such as HER2
(ERBB2), MET and FGFR1, and loss of the lipid phosphatases
PTEN and INPP4B. PI3K is activated by growth factor RTKs and
G-protein–coupled receptors. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce the second
messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3; refs.
2, 3). Upon formation of PIP3, the pleckstrin homology domain
of AKT and PDK1 colocalize at the plasma membrane, resulting in phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and its activation.
Negative regulation of this pathway is conferred by PTEN and
INPP4B, which cleave phosphate groups in PIP3 and PIP2,
respectively. AKT activates the mTOR-containing complex 1
(TORC1) that, via S6K and 4E-BP1, regulates mRNA translation
and protein synthesis. mTOR is part of another complex
(TORC2), which phosphorlylates AKT at S473 and fully induces
its catalytic activity.
HER2 is ampliﬁed in about 25% of breast cancers and is
associated with high cancer virulence and poor patient prognosis (4, 5). In HER2þ breast cancer cells, HER2 couples to
and phosphorylates the kinase-deﬁcient HER3 receptor that,
in turn, potently activates PI3K/AKT. As a result, HER3 is
required for HER2 and PI3K-mediated tumorigenesis. For

example, HER3 is activated in breast cancers with HER2
overexpression (6) and coexpression of HER2 and HER3 is
associated with decreased patient survival (7). Mammary
tumors occurring in mice overexpressing the Neu transgene,
the rat homolog of human HER2, exhibit increased expression
and phosphorylation of HER3 (8). HER3 is as essential as
HER2 for maintaining cell viability in a panel of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (9). In addition, loss of HER3
prevents HER2-mediated transformation of mammary epithelium (10). HER2 is unable to directly bind to and activate
p85/PI3K. Conversely, HER3 contains 6 p85-binding motifs
and, when dimerized with and activated by HER2, can potently
activate PI3K (9). Expression of the H1047R PIK3CA mutation
in cells that overexpress HER2 upregulates the HER3/HER4
ligand heregulin and knockdown of HER3 inhibits growth of
HER2þ/PI3K mutant cells (11). Finally, genetic ablation of
HER3 signiﬁcantly delays tumor formation and reduces metastases in transgenic mice expressing the polyomavirus T antigen
in the mammary gland (12), a mouse tumor model where PI3K
is also required for transformation (13).
In this study, we used cancer cells and xenografts with
different modes of aberrant PI3K pathway activation to examine the effects of LJM716, an HER3 monoclonal antibody that
inhibits ligand-induced and ligand-independent HER3 dimerization and activation (14) as a single agent or in combination
with BYL719, a p110a-speciﬁc PI3K inhibitor (15). Treatment
with the LJM716 antibody reduced HER2-HER3 and HER3-p85
dimers, P-HER3 and P-AKT, and, as a single agent, delayed
growth of HER2þ xenografts. LJM716 and BYL719 synergistically inhibited growth and PI3K in a panel of HER2þ and
PIK3CA mutant cell lines. HER2þ/PIK3CA mutant, trastuzumab-resistant MDA453 xenografts regressed completely after
only 3 weeks of therapy with LJM716 and BYL719 whereas
either single agent inhibited growth partially. The combination
of trastuzumab/LJM716/BYL719 induced striking regression of
large trastuzumab-sensitive BT474 tumors and prolonged
survival of mice after discontinuation of treatment. Overall,
these data suggest that dual blockade of the HER2 network
with an HER3 antibody that inhibits HER2-HER3 dimers in
combination with a p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor in the absence of a
direct HER2 antagonist is an effective treatment approach
against HER2-overexpressing cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), maintained in ATCC-recommended media
plus 10% FBS (Gibco) and authenticated by short tandem repeat
proﬁling using Sanger sequencing (March 2011). HR6 cells were
derived from a trastuzumab-resistant BT474 xenograft in our
laboratory and have been described previously (16). The following drugs were used: lapatinib (GW-572016; LC Laboratories),
trastuzumab (Vanderbilt University Hospital Pharmacy), and
LJM716 and BYL719 (both from Novartis).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays
Cells were prepared as described (17). Immunoprecipitation
was conducted by incubating 500 mg of protein extract with

6014

Cancer Res; 73(19) October 1, 2013

1 mg of an HER3 C-terminus antibody (Neomarkers) conjugated to biotin and incubated with streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads (Life Technologies) overnight at 4 C. The mixture was
washed 5 times in NP-40 lysis buffer and boiled for 5 minutes in
2 loading buffer before being subjected to SDS-PAGE. Lysates
were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies
included: Y1197 and Y1289 P-HER3, S473, and T308 P-Akt, total
Akt, T202/Y204 P-Erk, total Erk, P-GSK3a/b, P-S6 (all from
Cell Signaling), HER3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HER2 (Neomarkers), and b-actin (Sigma). Immunoreative bands were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Promega).
Fluorescent proximity–based antibody-dependent
detection (VeraTag) assay
VeraTag assays were conducted on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded (FFPE) tumor sections as described previously (18,
19), with modiﬁcations (20).
Monolayer and three-dimensional growth assays
The CellTiterGlo Assay was conducted per manufacturer's
instructions (Promega) and details are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods. For monolayer assay with
crystal violet staining, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 
104/well) in 10% FBS-containing medium followed by treatment with inhibitors. Media and inhibitors were replenished
every 2 to 3 days until 60% to 80% conﬂuence was achieved
in untreated wells. Cells were then stained with crystal violet
and quantiﬁed as described (21). For growth in three-dimensional (3D), cells were seeded on growth factor–reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in 48-well plates following published protocols (22). Inhibitors were added to the medium
at the time of cell seeding; 12 to 16 days later, the plates were
scanned and colonies measuring 25 mm were counted
using GelCount software (Oxford Optronix). Colonies were
photographed using an Olympus DP10 camera mounted in
an inverted microscope.
Xenograft studies
All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care Committee of Vanderbilt University. Details are
provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
HER3 antibody inhibits HER3-PI3K signaling
We ﬁrst treated a panel of HER2 gene-ampliﬁed human
breast cancer cells with LJM716 (14). HR6 cells, derived from
BT474 xenografts, are resistant to trastuzumab in vivo and
overexpress EGFR and HER3 ligands (16). MDA453, HCC1954,
and SUM190 cells contain a mutation in the catalytic domain
(H1047R) and MDA361 cells contain a mutation in the helical
domain (E545K) of PIK3CA. HCC1569 cells are PTEN-null (23).
In all cell lines, the antibody potently inhibited phosphorylation at 2 of the 6 p85 binding sites in HER3, Tyr-1197, and Tyr1289, starting at 1 to 24 hours (Fig. 1). This inhibition of P-HER3
translated into inhibition of downstream P-AKT. Notably, HR6

HER2/PI3K Blockade with HER3 Antibody and p110a Inhibitor

Figure 1. LJM716 inhibits HER3-PI3K signaling. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with 10 mg/mL of LJM716 over a 24-hour time course. Whole cell lysates
were prepared and separated in a 7% SDS gel followed by immunoblot analysis with indicated antibodies.

and HCC1954 cells did not show decreased S473 P-AKT but had
modest inhibition of T308 P-AKT. In most cases, there was a
recovery of P-AKT at 24 hours after the addition of LJM716.
Treatment with LJM716 did not affect P-ERK, suggesting that
HER3 signals mainly through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Some
cell lines exhibited a reduction in total HER3 (MDA361,
SUM190, HCC1954, and MDA453) but this reduction in receptor protein was not uniform and not necessary to see a
reduction in P-HER3 and P-AKT levels upon treatment with
LJM716. This suggests that the mechanism of action of
LJM6716 does not solely involve receptor downregulation.
LJM716 blocks HER2-HER3 heterodimers
The crystal structure of HER3 bound to the LJM716 Fab
fragment reveals that LJM716 binds to a complex epitope
distributed across domains II and IV of the HER3 ectodomain (14). This interaction locks HER3 in a tethered, inactive
conformation, where it is unable to dimerize with other
members of the ERBB receptor family. Thus, we next examined if LJM716 inhibits HER2/HER3 interactions using a
ﬂuorescent antibody–based proximity assay (VeraTag). This
assay can quantify protein–protein interactions in FFPE cell
pellets or tissue sections and involves the use of 2 monoclonal antibodies, 1 conjugated via a cleavable tether to a
ﬂuorescent reporter tag, and the other linked to a photosensitizer molecule. Photoactivation with red light results in
release of singlet oxygen that then cleaves the tether and
releases the ﬂuorescent tag on the second antibody. The
area of inﬂuence of the singlet oxygen is limited by the
proximity of receptors to which the antibodies are directed
(18). The released ﬂuorescent tag can then be collected and
quantiﬁed using capillary electrophoresis and used as an
indicator of levels of protein–protein interaction. Mice bear-

ing BT474 and MDA453 xenografts were treated with 2 doses
of 20 mg/kg LJM716 i.p. or vehicle over a 3-day period.
Tumors were harvested 4 hours after the second dose of
antibody. FFPE tumor sections were subjected to VeraTag
analysis of total HER2, total HER3, Y1289 P-HER3, HER2HER3 dimers, and HER3-p85 (PI3K) dimers. There was not a
difference in total HER2 or HER3 between LJM716-treated
tumors and controls. However, both tumor types treated
with the antibody exhibited a signiﬁcant reduction in HER2HER3 dimers and Y1289 P-HER3 compared with untreated
xenografts. BT474 but not MDA453 xenografts also showed a
reduction in HER3-p85 (PI3K) complexes (Fig. 2A). We next
conﬁrmed that the HER3 antibody inhibits ligand-independent HER2-HER3 interactions by immunoprecipitating
HER3 from lysates of cells grown in culture in the absence or
presence of a saturating concentration of LJM716 for 1 to 4
hours. HER2 immunoblot analysis of HER3 antibody pulldowns showed a clear reduction in HER2 in lysates from
BT474 and SKBR3 cells treated with the antibody (Fig. 2B).
Consistent with the above-mentioned structural data (14),
these results suggest that LJM716 disassembles constitutive
HER2-HER3 dimers in intact cells.
HER3 antibody in combination with trastuzumab and
lapatinib improves survival in vivo
We next assessed the ability of LJM716 to inhibit tumor
growth in vivo as a single agent or in combination with HER2
inhibitors. Mice bearing BT474 xenografts measuring 200
mm3 were treated with vehicle, LJM716, trastuzumab, trastuzumab/LJM716, lapatinib/trasuzumab, or lapatinib/trastuzumab/LJM716. Treatment with LJM716 alone markedly delayed
growth of BT474 xenografts (Fig. 3A). The combination of
LJM716/trastuzumab was more active than each antibody

growth, particularly lapatinib/trastuzumab, LJM716/trastuzumab, and the 3-drug combination. Mice treated with any of
these 3 combinations exhibited a close to complete response
with tumors measuring <25 mm3 after 3 weeks of treatment
(Fig. 3A). Treatment was stopped at this time and tumor
regrowth was monitored. To assess the effect of treatment on
survival, mice were followed until they reached a tumor burden
of 2,000 mm3, time when they had to be humanely euthanized
according to institutional guidelines. At 34 weeks of follow-up
with no treatment, less than 40% of mice in the lapatinib/
trastuzumab and the LJM716/trastuzumab arms were alive
whereas 93% of mice in the lapatinib/trastuzumab/LJM716
group were so (P ¼ 0.0012, log-rank test; Fig. 3B).

HER3 antibody synergizes with p110a inhibitor against
HER2þ tumor cells
We speculated that a combination of a p110a-speciﬁc
inhibitor and the HER3 antibody would be a potent inhibitor
of PI3K signaling in HER2þ cells and, as such, induce signiﬁcant growth inhibition in the absence of a direct antagonist of HER2. Thus, we tested the combination of LJM716
and the p110a inhibitor BYL719 in an 18-cancer cell line
panel enriched with HER2 gene-ampliﬁed and PIK3CA
mutant cells. Treatment with LJM716 alone inhibited proliferation, deﬁned as >25% growth inhibition relative to
control, in 6 of 18 (33%) cell lines as measured by the cell
content of ATP (CellTiterGlo assay). Treatment with BYL719
induced >25% growth inhibition in 9 of 18 (50%) cell lines,

HER2/PI3K Blockade with HER3 Antibody and p110a Inhibitor

vehicle or the indicated combinations of 20 mg/kg LJM716, 20 mg/kg trastuzumab, and 100 mg/kg lapatinib. Treatment was administered for 3 weeks. Tumors
were measured 2 to 3 times a week with calipers. Number of mice per treatment group is indicated. Each data point represents the mean tumor volume in

particularly those with hotspot mutations (i.e., H1047R,
E545K) in PIK3CA (Fig. 4A, cell lines marked red). In 12 of
18 (67%) cell lines, treatment with the combination of
LJM716 with BYL719 resulted in >25% growth inhibition
(Fig. 4A). Combination activity exceeded that enacted by
either agent in isolation in 11 of 18 (61%) cell lines. Analysis
using the Chalice software package conﬁrmed that combination treatment resulted in synergistic action of the 2
compounds (Supplementary Fig. S1). We conﬁrmed these
results in a second assay where cells are plated in monolayer
followed by crystal violet staining. We observed a statistical
decrease in growth of 4 of 5 HER2þ breast cancer cell lines
treated with LJM716 and BYL719 compared with either single
agent (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar results
were observed in single cells plated in 3D Matrigel and
assessed for colony formation for 14 to 21 days, where 5 of
5 cell lines treated with LJM716 and BYL719 exhibited a
statistically larger reduction in growth compared with either
single agent (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S3). Finally, we
examined the effect of the combination and single drugs on
cell signaling at 1 to 24 hours. Treatment with BYL719 as a
single agent increased P-HER3 in all 4 cell lines examined
(Fig. 4D), consistent with the reported observation that
inhibition of PI3K/AKT results in compensatory upregulation of active HER3 (24, 25). BYL719 reduced both S473 and
T308 P-AKT, although in some cases this inhibition was
partial. In BT474 and MDA361 cells, more potent inhibition
of S473 P-AKT S473 was achieved with the combination of
LJM716/BYL719 (at 24 hours) than with either single agent.
A similar result was observed with HCC1954 cells treated for

1 hour with the combination (Fig. 4D). Treatment with the
combination did not affect P-ERK in 3 of the 4 cell lines.
Combination of PI3Ka inhibitor and HER3 antibody
inhibits growth of HER2þ xenografts
Herein, we extended the in vitro observations (Fig. 4) to
established tumors in mice. We initially investigated the effect
short-term treatment of the HER3 antibody LJM716 and the
PI3Ka inhibitor BYL719 had on xenografts to examine if
synergistic changes in biomarkers of PI3/AKT pathway activity
occurred in vivo. We treated athymic mice with established
MDA453 and HCC1954 xenografts with vehicle, LJM716,
BYL719, or the combination for 3 days. Tumors were harvested
and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In HCC1954 xenografts
treated with the combination, there was a more pronounced
inhibition of T308 and S473 P-AKT, P-GSK3a/b, and P-S6
compared with tumors in mice treated with either single agent
(Fig. 5A).
Next, we determined the effect of treatment in mice bearing
either NCI-N87 gastric or MDA453 breast cancer xenografts.
Athymic mice bearing NCI-N87 xenografts of 250 mm3 were
randomized to therapy with vehicle, BYL719, LJM716, or the
combination of both inhibitors. BYL719 and the combination
of BYL719/LJM716 but not LJM716 alone inhibited growth of
NCI-N87 tumors. After 48 days of continuous dosing, tumor
volume in the group treated with both inhibitors was significantly smaller than in mice treated with the p110a inhibitor
(P ¼ 0.038, Mann–Whitney rank sum test; Fig. 5B). NCI-N87
tumors in mice treated with LJM716, BYL719, or the combination of the 2 exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced S473 P-AKT

complete response, treatment was stopped. After 15 weeks of
follow up, no mice exhibited a tumor recurrence.
We ﬁnally examined the activity of the combination of
the HER3 antibody and the PI3Ka inhibitor with or without
the HER2 antibody trastuzumab in an HER2-dependent,
trastuzumab-sensitive xenograft. Mice bearing large BT474
xenografts (400 mm3) were treated with vehicle, BYL719,
trastuzumab/BYL719, trastuzumab/LJM716, LJM716/BYL719,
or BYL719/trastuzumab/LJM716. Mice in all these 4 groups
exhibited rapid tumor regressions within 24 days of therapy
(Fig. 6A). Thirty weeks after treatment discontinuation, 5 of 8
(63%) mice in the BYL719/trastuzumab/LJM716 exhibited
tumor recurrences (200 mm3), whereas >85% of mice in all
other groups did so (P ¼ 0.0160, log-rank test; Fig. 6B).
Moreover, 6 of 7 (86%) mice treated with trastuzumab/BYL719,
5 of 6 (83%) mice treated with trastuzumab/LJM716, and 6 of 6
(100%) mice treated with LJM716/BYL719; whereas only 1 of 7
(14%) mice treated with the triple drug combination had to be
euthanized due to tumors reaching 2,000 mm3 in volume

This translated to a signiﬁcant increase in survival in mice
treated with the triple therapy compared with mice treated
with various dual therapies (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The HER2 receptor does not have a known activating ligand.
Its tyrosine kinase activity can be induced by ligand-induced
dimerization with the ERBB coreceptors EGFR and HER3
and/or by ligand-independent homo- and hetero-oligomerization as a result of gene ampliﬁcation and protein overexpression (26). Heregulin binds to HER3, causing a change from a
closed to an open conformation exposing the dimerization
loop in subdomain II of the receptor ectodomain that, in turn,
leads to the formation of HER2-HER3 dimers. In HER2-overexpressing cells and tumors, HER2 and HER3 are constitutively
phosphorylated in the absence of added ligands (9). HER3
neutralizing antibodies screened for their ability to inhibit
ligand binding to HER3 are in clinical development in patients

HER2/PI3K Blockade with HER3 Antibody and p110a Inhibitor

with solid tumors (27–29). As a single therapy, these antibodies
have been shown to inhibit heregulin-dependent cancer cells
but are less effective at inhibiting growth of HER2þ xenografts
(17, 28). This supports the notion that HER2-overexpressing
cancer cells also rely on constitutive, ligand-independent
HER2-HER3 and/or HER2-EGFR dimers for tumor progression.
LJM716 was designed to inhibit both ligand-independent and
ligand-induced HER3 signaling. The crystal structural of the
Fab fragment of LJM716 bound to the HER3 ectodomain
reveals that the antibody binds a complex epitope on subdomains II and IV of HER3 that locks the receptor's extracellular domain in the tethered, closed conformation (14). We
show herein that LJM716 inhibits dimerization between HER2
and HER3 in vivo (Fig. 2) and, as a single agent, inhibits the
growth of HER2-overexpressing breast and gastric cancer
xenografts (Figs. 3A and 5B). To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst report of an HER3 neutralizing antibody with preclinical
activity as a single drug against HER2 gene-ampliﬁed tumors in
vivo. We speculate LJM716 should be able to disrupt other
PI3K-activating HER3-containing dimmers, where HER2 is not
the kinase that phosphorylates HER3. Examples include EGFR,
MET, IGF-IR, FGFR, Src, and others kinases, which can be
investigated in future studies.
HER2-overexpressing cells rely on HER2-HER3 dimers for
potent activation of PI3K/AKT. In turn, PI3K signaling is
critical for the viability and progression of HER2þ cancer cells.
Indeed, HER2-directed therapies should inhibit PI3K downstream HER2 to inhibit growth of HER2-dependent cancer cells
(30, 31). In tumor cells driven by HER2 or the rat homolog Neu,
PIP3 formation is mediated by the catalytic activity of the
p110a isozyme, encoded by the PIK3CA gene. Genetic ablation
of p110a blocks tumor formation in transgenic mice expressing the Neu oncogene in the mammary gland (32). Consistent
with these data, HER2þ tumor cells in culture are highly
sensitive to PI3K inhibitors (33–35). Further supporting the
reliance of HER2þ cancers on PI3K signaling downstream, a
signiﬁcant fraction of HER2-enriched breast tumors in the
TCGA database also harbor activating mutations in PIK3CA
(36). It is unclear if HER2þ tumor cells with PI3K pathway
mutations have a more virulent phenotype than HER2þ
tumors without those alterations. However, PI3K pathway
mutations, including loss of PTEN, have been associated with
resistance to anti-HER2 therapies (37–40). Although PI3K
pathway antagonists are potent inhibitors of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells (34, 35), feedback upregulation of total
and activated HER3 has been shown to dampen the full
antitumor action of these inhibitors (24). Thus, in this work
we examined dual blockade of the HER2/HER3/PI3K axis with
an antibody targeting HER3 and a PI3Ka inhibitor. The combination of LJM716 with BYL719 was highly active against
several HER2 gene-ampliﬁed cell lines irrespective of their
PI3K mutation status (Fig. 4). As a single agent, LJM716
effectively inhibited P-HER3 and P-AKT in HER2þ cancer cell
lines. In some instances, we observed a recovery of P-AKT 24
hours after treatment with LJM716 (Fig. 1). However, LJM716 in
combination with BYL719 induced more sustained inhibition
of P-AKT and downstream effectors than either drug alone
(Figs. 4D and 5C), suggesting this approach overcomes the

www.aacrjournals.org

reactivation of HER3 triggered by inhibition of PI3K/AKT
(17, 24, 25). Using this combination of HER3 and PI3Ka
antagonists in the absence of a direct HER2 inhibitor, we
observed complete elimination of trastuzumab-resistant
MDA453 xenografts (Fig. 5B). Whether this combination has
similar activity in patients with HER2þ breast cancer progressing on trastuzumab will require further clinical investigation.
It is increasingly accepted that for optimal inhibition of
HER2 function in HER2þ breast cancer cells, treatment with at
least 2 anti-HER2 drugs is required. Currently, the combinations of trastuzumab and lapatinib and of trastuzumab and
pertuzumab are approved by the FDA for use in patients with
metastatic HER2þ breast cancer. These 3 drugs interact with
HER2 directly. Other plausible approaches for dual blockade of
HER2 are concurrent use of a direct inhibitor of HER2 with a
second drug targeted to a different component of the HER2/
HER3/PI3K axis. Such combinations would include trastuzumab and an HER3 antibody or trastuzumab and a PI3K
inhibitor, for example. Support for the ﬁrst combination is
shown in Fig. 3A, where the combination of trastuzumab/
LJM716 was clearly superior to each antibody alone against
BT474 xenografts. Recent preclinical reports support efﬁcacy
of the combination of trastuzumab (or lapatinib) with PI3K
inhibitors (24, 41–43), which are currently being tested in
clinical trials. Based on the data presented herein, we propose
that the combination of an HER3 antibody that eliminates both
ligand-dependent and -independent HER3 dimerization and a
p110a inhibitor is another strategy for dual blockade of the
HER2/HER3/PI3K axis in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.
This dual approach should be explored clinically in patients
with this breast cancer subtype that have progressed on
trastuzumab.
