Abstract:

Our current understanding of eukaryotic transcription has greatly benefited from
use of small molecule inhibitors that have delineated multiple regulatory steps in
site-specific initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis by multiple forms of RNA
polymerase (RNAP). This class of “transcription” drugs is also of therapeutic interest
and under evaluation in clinical trials. However, to date very few small molecules that
directly abolish transcription have been identified, particularly those that act at the
level of RNAP II initiation. Using a biochemical assay that measures transcription from
recombinant, natural p53-responsive promoters and an artificial “super” promoter,
we have identified three distinct small molecules that inhibit mRNA synthesis in
vitro. Unexpectedly, these are kinase inhibitors, Hypericin, Rottlerin, and SP600125,
with known substrates, which we find also strongly impair transcriptional initiation
(IC50s = µM range) by targeting specific components of the RNAP II pre-initiation
complex. When measured before and during transcription in vitro, one common
target of inhibition by all three compounds is modification of the TATA Binding
Protein (TBP) within the RNAP II holocomplex as it converts to an active transcribing
enzyme. On this basis, by blocking the critical step of TBP modification, transcriptional
initiation is effectively abolished even on structurally distinct core promoters.

INTRODUCTION

on diverse enzymatic reactions such as phosphorylation,
ubiquitinylation, and acetylation, it is possible to inhibit
mRNA production using specific pharmacological
agents. For example, the transition from RNAP II preinitiation to initiation and finally elongation is influenced
by modifications within its carboxyl-terminal domain
(CTD), which then functions as a platform for the ordered
assembly of different pre-mRNA processing machinery
[3]. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk)
Cdk7 and Cdk9 abolishes RNAP II phosphorylation
at specific serine residues in the CTD and prevents
transcriptional elongation [4]. DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-b-Dribofuranosylbenzimidazole), which specifically inhibits
CTD phosphorylation at serine 2, has been a particularly
useful reagent in the transcription field because it has
facilitated the dissection of multiple elongation steps and
led to the identification of important transcription factors
[5]. Advanced analogs of DRB such as Flavopiridol
have also been developed and have shown promising

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and
basal transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIH, TFIIB,
assemble into versatile pre-initiation complexes (PIC) on
core promoters to regulate initiation of mRNA synthesis.
Core promoters extend from ~-50 to + 50 bp relative to
the start site of transcription at +1 and are composed of
different combinations of specific DNA sequence motifs
such as the TATA box, initiator (INR), TFIIB recognition
element (BRE), downstream promoter element (DPE),
and motif ten element (MTE). The exact combination
of these DNA motifs can differentially modulate the
assembly of PIC complexes, start site precision of
initiation, and transcriptional kinetics from specific
promoters [1, 2]. After PIC assembly, multiple enzymatic
processes must take place for productive mRNA synthesis
to occur at the sequential steps of initiation, elongation,
and RNA processing. Because transcription is dependent

the first Cdk inhibitors to be tested in clinical trials and
have shown promising results, particularly in treating
certain chronic leukemias or in combination therapy
[14-16]. With the increasing availability of commercial
drug libraries, it is now possible to identify novel small
molecules that promote apoptosis through transcription
interference. Our aim was to use in vitro transcription
assays to identify new transcription inhibitors that act at a
defined step in mRNA synthesis, initiation. To date, very
few inhibitors of eukaryotic RNA initiation have been
identified, with the exception of the mushroom toxin,
alpha-amanitin, a cyclic peptide that acts by binding
directly to RNAP II and preventing its translocation [17].
In this study, we analyzed the impact of multiple
kinase inhibitors on the activity of three recombinant
DNA templates containing distinct core promoter
structures: two natural p53-responsive promoters and an

a well-characterized
vitro transcription assay. This enabled us to identify three
compounds, Hypericin, Rottlerin, and SP600125 that are
each strong inhibitors of RNA synthesis. In contrast to

therapeutic potential for several types of human cancer
[6]. Known Cdk inhibitors act by competing for the ATP
binding site on target kinases and have broad-spectrum
substrate specificities, including Cdk2/cyclin E, Cdk7/
cyclin H and Cdk9/cyclin T [7]. Interestingly, Flavopiridol
and other drugs that affect basal transcriptional steps were
initially thought to inhibit kinases involved in cell cycle
progression or other signaling pathways [8-10].
It has been proposed that the transcription machinery
itself may be a pivotal stress sensor that directs cell fate
decisions by gauging the severity of damage and activating
the p53 tumor suppressor pathway [11]. In this regard,
several studies have shown that blocking global cellular
mRNA synthesis in human cancer cell lines by the Cdk
inhibitors Roscovitine (Seliciclib, CYC202), Flavopiridol,
DRB, and H7 induces a strong stress response resulting
in nuclear accumulation of p53, induction of certain p53
target genes, and apoptosis [12-14]. On this basis, selective
interference of transcription has become an active area
of pursuit for the development of potential anti-tumor
therapeutics [13]. Indeed, Flavopiridol and UCN-01 were

DRB or Flavopiridol, drugs that abolish elongation by
decreasing bulk cellular levels of phosphorylated CTD
serine 2 phosphorylation, these compounds specifically
inhibit early steps in transcription initiation by affecting
enzymatically engaged RNAP II/Promoter complexes.
A shared target of all three compounds is inhibition of
modification of the TATA Binding Protein (TBP) within
the RNAP II holocomplex as it converts to an actively
transcribing form. In addition, we observe drug-specific
effects on CTD phosphorylation of both bulk cellular and
promoter-bound RNAP II. This reveals an unexpected
role for diverse protein kinase inhibitors in directly
regulating transcriptional initiation and expands their
known substrate specificities to include essential factors
that function on structurally distinct core promoters.

programmed with supercoiled plasmids containing
recombinant promoters that drive expression of reporter
genes. This assay can distinguish between two distinct
steps in transcription, initiation of RNA synthesis by
RNAP II and elongation of RNA transcripts. Although
several inhibitors of elongation are known (DRB,
Flavopiridol) [19], very few agents that impair initiation
have been identified, except a-amanitin. For this reason,
we specifically measured RNAP II-dependent initiation
in our assays. The recombinant DNA templates we
analyzed consisted of two natural human promoters,
p21 and Fas/APO1, and one synthetic promoter, the
Super Core Promoter (SCP1). p21 and Fas/APO1 are
physiologically important p53 target genes that regulate
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively [20-22]. Both
p21 and Fas/APO1 were previously characterized by in
vitro transcription and can drive robust RNA synthesis in
this assay [23]. Furthermore, p21 and Fas/APO1 represent
two structurally distinct types of natural promoters (Figure
1A). p21 contains multiple classic core promoter elements
such as a TATA box, initiator (INR), and downstream
promoter element (DPE). Whereas Fas/APO1 lacks these
canonical elements but contains a critical NF-Y response
element near the +1 start site of transcription. NF-Y is
a bifunctional transcription factor that regulates basal
expression of Fas/APO1 in vivo [23]. The SCP1 promoter

activity (Figure 3). Interestingly, none of the individual
compounds in cocktail 8 were able to reduce transcription,
which suggests a requirement for combinatorial inhibition
in this particular mix. The three active compounds
identified using this strategy were Hypericin, Rottlerin,
and SP600125. These three small molecules have
not previously been implicated, to our knowledge, in
blocking basal transcription initiation. Hypericin induces
apoptosis in cancer cells and is a potent antiviral agent
[25-27]. Hypericin has also been used as a photocytotoxic
compound, becoming active towards other targets upon
intense light activation. This drug has been shown to inhibit
protein kinase C (PKC), irreversibly damage the sarco/
endoplasmic reticulum and other cellular membranes,
decrease cellular pH, and inhibit mitochondrial function
[27-29]. Rottlerin (mallotoxin) is considered to be a
strong inhibitor of PKC delta but several studies have
reported that it can inhibit other targets without affecting
PKC delta [30-32]. SP600125 is a novel and selective
inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (5). These
three compounds have very different substrate targets,
yet each can effectively impair RNAP II initiation on the
structurally distinct promoters that we examined.
We further characterized these compounds by
analyzing their half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) to measure their individual effectiveness of the
drugs towards transcription, specifically using the p21
promoter template. The approximate IC50 values were:
Hypericin, 12.6µM; Rottlerin, 3.52µM; and SP600125,
5.03µM (Figure 4). Hypericin has been reported to be an
effective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor with IC50
values between 0.37-8.7µM [25]. Our data demonstrate
that photo-inactivated Hypericin can inhibit transcription
at slightly higher concentrations. Rottlerin has been
frequently used as a specific inhibitor of PKC delta and
has been reported to have an IC50 of 3-6µM [31, 33].
Another study examining multiple compounds found that
Rottlerin does not inhibit PKC delta but instead inhibits
PRAK and MAPKAP-K2 potently, with IC50 values
of 1.9µM and 5.4µM, respectively [30]. Our results
suggest that Rottlerin inhibits RNAP II transcription
initiation with comparable specificity as that towards
its known substrates, PKC delta, MAPKAP-K2, and
PRAK. SP600125, a well-characterized inhibitor of
JNK, can block c-Jun phosphorylation in cells with an
IC50 of 5–10 μM. However, biochemical assays using
purified components produced IC50 values of 0.11μM
[34]. SP600125 is an ATP competitor, thus the observed
differences in IC50 values from biochemical and cellbased assays most likely reflects high ATP levels in cells.
We used non-limiting amounts of ATP in the in vitro
transcription reactions and our observed IC50 of 5.03μM
probably represents a more “in vivo” concentration.

by using sequence motifs from viral as well as cellular
genes [24]. We included the SCP1 template in all of our
transcription reactions, containing either p21 or Fas/
APO1 plasmids, as a positive internal control because of
its strong activity in vitro. Importantly, use of these three
DNA templates allowed us to screen for compounds that
could inhibit the initiation of RNAP II transcription from
structurally diverse promoters.
In the in vitro transcription assay, mRNA synthesis is
detected by primer extension, in which purified transcripts
are annealed to a short, 32P-labeled DNA primer followed
by Reverse Transcriptase-mediated extension to generate
transcripts of known length, and visualized by PAGE
(Figure 1B). Due to the multiple steps involved in this
assay, it is not well-suited for use in high-throughput
screening of large compound libraries. However, this
approach has multiple advantages that make it attractive to
screen a small collection of compounds. For example, one
can selectively analyze the effect of compounds or other
therapeutics in targeting distinct steps in transcription,
such as PIC assembly, initiation (up to 100 bp), elongation
and termination. In the present study, we directly measured
RNAP II-directed initiation only, which was independent
of chromatin structure, nuclear localization, or other
upstream processes that complicate the interpretation of
cell-based assays, thus greatly simplifying our analyses.
To begin, we tested the sensitivity of in vitro transcription
to DMSO since drugs are commonly dissolved in this
solvent. Activity from the three promoters was robust in
buffers containing up to 4% DMSO (v/v) (Figure 1C),
which set the limit for the volume of compound that could
be added to each reaction.

Identification of specific kinase inhibitors that
directly impair transcriptional initiation
We screened 80 commercial kinase inhibitors
(BIOMOL International, see Supplemental Table 1) for
their activities towards early steps in transcription on
the p21, Fas/APO1, and SCP1 promoters. To facilitate
screening, the 80 kinase inhibitors were first combined
into 20 cocktail mixes each containing four drugs. The
4-drug cocktails were added (50µM final concentration) to
the transcription reactions before initiating RNA synthesis
with nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) (Figure 2A). The
resulting transcripts were measured by primer extension,
followed by PAGE, and compared using a phosphoimager.
Using this strategy, we identified four cocktail mixes
(C-7, C-8, C-14, and C-16) that significantly reduced
transcriptional activity from each of the three promoters
(Figure 2B).
The four cocktail mixes were further investigated
by testing each of the compounds individually. We
observed that only a single compound from cocktails
C-7, C-14, and C-16 significantly inhibited transcriptional

shown in Figure 5B, nearly equal amounts of RNAP
II were assembled and retained after NTP addition on
promoters in the presence or absence of the each of the
kinase inhibitors, with the exception of Hypericin which
showed a slight decrease in bound RNAP II. Similarly,
no effect of any drug was observed on TFIIB, a required
initiation factor that interacts with the BRE core promoter
element; or Cdk9, a kinase that is required for RNAP
II elongation through phosphorylation of CTD-serine
2 and the target of inhibition by DRB and Flavopiridol
[19]. Interestingly, only SP600125 demonstrated a clear
inhibition of phosphorylation of promoter-bound RNAP
II at both serine 2 and serine 5 within the CTD. Whether
SP600125 inhibits distinct kinases that phosphorylate
each residue or a single kinase that acts upstream of these
events is unknown at present. One common feature of each
of the three drugs is the striking loss of mobility shift of
the promoter-bound TATA Binding Protein (TBP). In the
absence of drug (DMSO lanes), TBP migrates as a single
band when part of the pre-initiation complex (lane 1).
However upon NTP addition, which activates transcription
by RNAP II, bound TBP appears to undergo a series of
post-translational modifications as indicated by a trailing
shift to higher molecular weight species (compare lanes
1 and 2). These are most likely phosphorylated isoforms

Known kinase inhibitors that interfere with
transcription, such as Flavopridol and DRB, typically
block phosphorylation of the RNAP II C-terminal domain
(CTD), which abolishes elongation. We tested Hypericin,
Rottlerin, and SP600125 for their ability to inhibit serine 2
or serine 5 phosphorylation of the RNAP II-CTD in human
colon cancer HCT116 cells. We found that each drug had
relatively little effect on bulk, cellular RNAP II CTD
phosphorylation compared to DRB (see Supplemental
Data). To refine this analysis and explore how these
compounds may inhibit transcription when RNAP II is
actually assembled on a target promoter, we tested their
individual activities towards several components of the
initiation complex using immobilized DNA templates.
In this assay, the transcriptional machinery in HeLa
extracts is “recruited” to p21 promoter templates that are
immobilized on magnetic beads, excess unbound protein
is then washed from the beads leaving engaged RNAP II
“pre-initiation” complexes on the promoters. Transcription
is subsequently initiated by the addition of NTPs, which
converts the RNAP II machinery to a “post-initiation”
phase (diagrammed in Figure 5A). Capturing these
functionally distinct RNAP II complexes on immobilized
p21 promoters enabled us to examine the effect of
each kinase inhibitor on the protein composition and
modification status of several transcription components
by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. As

holocomplex as it converts to an active enzyme. On this
basis, by blocking the critical step of TBP conversion,
transcriptional initiation is effectively abolished.

CTD, which affects elongation rather than initiation.
Interestingly, our experiments reveal that Hypericin,
Rottlerin, and SP600125 have relatively low inhibitory
activity towards CTD phosphorylation of global RNAP
II (Figure S1). Only by analyzing phosphorylation of
promoter-bound RNAP II initiation complexes using
immobilized DNA templates were we able to detect
blockage of RNAP II CTD phosphorylation at both serine
2 and 5, specifically by SP600125. Using the immobilized
assay, we also observed a shift in electrophoretic mobility
(presumably due to protein modification) of promoterbound TBP upon addition of nucleotide triphosphates
(NTPs) to initiate transcription. Surprisingly, conversion
of TBP to transcription-dependent modified isoforms was
completely blocked by each of the three compounds; the
TBP modification disappears and looks exactly like TBP
bound before transcription initiation. A previous study
demonstrated that yeast TBP could be phosphorylated by
CK2, which copurifies with the TFIID holocomplex and
by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) [36-38].
Additional studies will be required to fully
understand the mechanism of action of these compounds
and their relevant kinase targets. It is noteworthy that
the three compounds inhibit TBP phosphorylation from
architecturally diverse promoters, revealing a requirement
for TBP within the TFIID complex from both TATA boxcontaining (p21 and SCP1) and TATA-less (Fas/APO1)
promoters. The identification of these compounds adds
to the limited toolbox available to scientists studying
transcription regulation. Hopefully, they will aid in finding
new mechanistic information and provide additional
drugs beyond those currently used to study RNAP II
transcription. In addition, analogues of these compounds
may provide new therapeutic candidates to treat some
types of human diseases.
Many therapeutic drugs have been used to treat
specific diseases without understanding their mechanism
of action. In this regard, in vitro transcription analyses
may be quite valuable, especially when adapted to a highthroughput format, since this assay is highly sensitive
and has been used extensively to decipher fundamental
mechanisms of transcription from core promoter elements,
activators, and repressors. Moreover, this versatile assay
can be modified to assess the effects of chemical and
biological agents on transcription that is regulated by
specific activators (i.e. p53-dependent transcription),
repressors, or enzymatic complexes. In addition, any DNA
template can be assembled into nucleosomal structures and
used to assay the effect of compounds on such regulatory
steps as protein-targeted chromatin remodeling, histone
modification, or other epigenetic events [18, 39, 40].
Consequently, the effect of small molecules or biologics
on gene regulation can be analyzed at a very precise
mechanistic level.

DISCUSSION
Using an in vitro transcription assay, we examined
the effect of 80 previously characterized kinase inhibitors
specifically on the initiation of RNA synthesis by human
RNAP II from three structurally diverse core promoters.
This assay, although labor intensive, is unique in providing
a semi-purified cell-free system in which to directly
analyze drug activity on components of the transcriptional
machinery. To facilitate screening the library of 80
commercially available kinase inhibitors, we initially
tested drug cocktails containing combined compounds.
We discovered four cocktails that demonstrated
significant reduction in transcriptional activity and further
characterized each compound separately. This led to
the identification of three novel inhibitors of RNAP IIdependent transcriptional initiation: Hypericin, Rottlerin,
and SP600125. These three compounds are thought
to have alternative targets and, in fact, many kinase
inhibitors are pan-specific, yet they are routinely used to
block “specific” enzymes. Thus, studies using Hypericin,
Rottlerin, or SP600125 and many other protein kinase
inhibitors (PKIs) are likely to have pleiotrophic effects,
particularly in cell-based studies. It is therefore striking
that novel and unexpected targets of these broad-spectrum
PKIs could be identified in such a direct and defined assay
as one that measures transcriptional initiation.
We characterized the strength of inhibition towards
transcription by calculating the IC50 for each compound.
This revealed that the specific activity of these compounds
was relatively strong. Rottlerin was the strongest inhibitor
of initiation, with an IC50 of approximately 3.52µM.
The compounds SP600125 and Hypericin were also
effective in the micromolar range, with IC50 values of
5.03µM and 12.6µM, respectively. Previous reports using
these compounds demonstrated their potential towards
reducing transcription. For example, exposure of human
Jurkat T-cells to Hypericin resulted in down-regulation
of global mRNA synthesis, culminating in a strong, timedependent cytotoxicity [34]. Our finding that Hypericin
directly targets components of the RNAP II transcription
complex to impair initiation may provide mechanistic
insight into this observation. In addition, SP600125 was
reported to reduce mRNA expression of the COX-2 gene
in cell-based studies, potentially by inhibiting JNK [35]. It
is possible that down-regulation of COX-2 expression can
be attributed to the ability of SP600125 to directly inhibit
transcription complexes bound to the COX-2 promoter.
Most kinase inhibitors that block transcription
usually function by preventing global cellular
phosphorylation of RNAP II at serine 2 within the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
25

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 18 - 28

In vitro transcription assays

(250 fmoles) were each incubated with HeLa nuclear
extract and reagents similar to in vitro transcription as
previously reported [23]. Protein complexes were allowed
to form a PIC on the promoter followed by treatment
with the drug compounds. Transcription was initiated by
adding NTPs and active transcription complexes were
subsequently captured.

Nuclear protein extracts from HeLa cells were
prepared as described (Dignam et al. 1983). Transcription
reactions included 10µl (~5-6µg/µl) HeLa Nuclear
Extract (HNE), 15µl HeLa Dialysis Buffer (HDB) (20mM
Hepes-pH7.9, 50mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 0.2mM EDTA,
10% glycerol) and 25µl transcription mix (0.4mg/ml
BSA, 20mM HEPES-pH 7.9, 70mM KCl, 3mM DTT,
1.2mM NTPs, 1-3mM MgCl2, 0.5µl RNase inhibitor per
reaction) and 500ng supercoiled plasmid DNA templates.
For the drug inhibition screen, NTPs were omitted from
the transcription mix and the PIC was allowed to form
for 30min at room temperature before adding 2µl of NTP
mix to start the reaction (final volumes were adjusted with
HDB). Transcription reactions were incubated in a 30°C
water bath. Reactions were stopped and processed using
reagents from Zymo Research (RNA Clean-up Kit-5) by
adding 200µl of RNA binding buffer, applying the mixture
to columns, washing two times with wash buffer and then
eluting with 8µl of RNAse-free water.

Western blotting
Captured proteins from the recruitment assay were
electrophoresed through 10% polyacrylamide/TBE gels
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots
were probed using antibodies to P-Ser5 CTD (H14) and
P-Ser2 CTD (H5) from Covance; and antibodies to RNAP
II (sc-9001), TBP (sc-273), TFIIB (sc-225), and CDK9
(sc-8338) from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies.

Primer extension analyses

CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT

Primer extension was performed by adding 3µl of
primer annealing mix (10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA, 1.25M
KCl) to each reaction and heating at 75°C for 2-3 minutes
in heating blocks. Reactions were removed from the heat
blocks and allowed to slowly cool to about 37°C. This
was followed by addition of 23µl reverse transcription
mix (20mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10mM MgCl2, 0.1mg/ml
Actinomycin D, 5mM DTT, 0.33mM dNTP) and 0.5µl
M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) per reaction
and incubation at 37°C for 1 hour. Final reactions were
precipitated, washed with ethanol, and placed in a speedvac
for 5 minutes. DNA pellets were each resuspended in
10µl formamide with EDTA (1mM)/NaOH(0.1mM) (2:1)
and heated to 95°C for 2-3 minutes followed by snap
cooling on ice. Samples were electrophoresed through
8% polyacrylamide/TBE gels (SequaGel-8, National
Diagnostics).
