Abstract
The mechanisms by which inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitizes non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to ionizing radiation remain poorly understood. We set out to characterize the
radiosensitizing effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab in
NSCLC cells that contain wild-type p53. Unexpectedly, EGFR inhibition led to pronounced cellular senescence
but not apoptosis of irradiated cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Senescence was completely dependent on wild-type
p53 and associated with a reduction in cell number as well as impaired clonogenic radiation survival. Study of
ten additional NSCLC cell lines revealed that senescence is a prominent mechanism of radiosensitization in 45%
of cell lines and occurs not only in cells with wild-type p53 but also in cells with mutant p53, where it is
associated with an induction of p16. Interestingly, senescence and radiosensitization were linked to an increase
in residual radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks irrespective of p53/p16 status. This effect of EGFR
inhibition was at least partially mediated by disruption of the MEK–ERK pathway. Thus, our data indicate a
common mechanism of radiosensitization by erlotinib or cetuximab across diverse genetic backgrounds. Our
findings also suggest that assays that are able to capture the initial proliferative delay that is associated with
senescence should be useful for screening large cell line panels to identify genomic biomarkers of EGFR
inhibitor–mediated radiosensitization. Cancer Res; 71(19); 6261–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
It has become clear that molecular-targeted cancer therapies can only reach their full potential through appropriate
patient selection. However, the substantial genetic heterogeneity inherent to human cancers makes the identification of
patients most likely to benefit from a given anticancer agent
challenging (1). Cancer-derived cell lines are increasingly
being used to model the genetic heterogeneity encountered
in patients. Recent technological advances have facilitated the

parallel analysis of large panels of cell lines, to test the efficacy
of novel agents and discover genomic biomarkers that are
predictive of treatment response (2, 3).
There has also been great interest in the combination of
targeted agents with radiation therapy to improve cure rates
in many disease sites, including non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), which is the leading cause of cancer death in the
United States (4). The "gold standard" for measurement of the
effects of radiation on cells, without and with drug interactions, has long been the clonogenic cell survival assay because
this assay is felt to best mimic the desired clinical outcome of
decreasing tumor cell clonogenicity (5). However, clonogenic
assays are not suitable for the large-scale and high-throughput
cell line screens that are needed to identify subsets of tumors
with sensitivity to radiation/drug combinations. Screening cell
line panels for evaluating cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of
anticancer drugs is usually based on various short-term cell
proliferation, survival, or viability assays (6–8). These assays,
which may reflect apoptotic responses or cell growth rate, are
generally poor predictors of clonogenic survival after irradiation and, therefore, have been regarded as unsuitable for
the study of cellular radiosensitivity in epithelial malignancies
(5, 9). However, it is likely that situations exist in which a given
agent enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation, on the basis
of both short-term survival/proliferation and clonogenic survival endpoints. A better understanding of the underlying

mechanisms will be critical for overcoming barriers to the use
of short-term assays in preclinical testing and clinical translation of combinations of radiation with targeted agents.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) initiates
diverse biological responses including enhanced cell proliferation and survival (10, 11). Inhibition of the EGFR by small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as erlotinib, or
monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as cetuximab, has been
shown to radiosensitize a limited number of NSCLC cell lines
in vitro and in vivo (12–14). However, the molecular and
cellular mechanisms by which EGFR TKI and mAb may cause
radiosensitization across genetically diverse cell lines have
remained largely elusive. Although a variety of signaling pathways downstream of EGFR has been implicated in radioresistance, including PI3K–AKT, MEK–ERK, and PLC–PKC,
no pathway has emerged as a common effector in more than
any one cell line (15–17).
Exposure of the cellular DNA to ionizing radiation inflicts
various types of damage (18). It is established that the
creation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) represents
the principal damage that, if not adequately repaired, leads
to loss of cell clonogenicity via the generation of lethal
chromosomal aberrations or the direct induction of apoptosis. Although exogenous DSBs can be induced by radiation, endogenous DSBs arise as byproducts of normal
intracellular metabolism. Misrepair of or failure to close
DSB can cause genomic instability, which may promote
carcinogenesis. Two principal DSB repair pathways have
been recognized, homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; refs. 18, 19). DSB caused by
radiation are predominantly repaired by the latter, which
operates mainly in G1 but also in the other cell-cycle phases.
Cellular senescence is an irreversible cell-cycle arrest, which
limits the proliferative capacity of cells exposed to stress
signals (20, 21). An inducible form of senescence may act in
response to oncogenic signaling as a natural barrier to interrupt carcinogenesis at a premalignant level. How senescence
programs can be reactivated in human tumors that have
overcome this barrier is currently of great interest (21). With
regard to EGFR inhibitors, it has been shown that these agents
can inhibit G1-S cell-cycle transition and have cytostatic
effects (13, 22–25). However, whether EGFR signaling
can suppress cellular senescence programs has remained
unknown.
The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor with
pleiotropic cellular functions, including regulation of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and various DNA repair pathways (26). In
primary human fibroblasts, p53 mediates radiation-induced
cellular senescence and decreases colony forming ability (27–
29), but it is unclear under which conditions p53 might be able
to mediate similar effects in cancers which generally have
suppressed senescence programs.
Here, we show that EGFR inhibition induces cellular senescence in response to DSB produced by radiation, thereby
affecting both short-term cell survival/proliferation and clonogenic survival endpoints. In a panel of NSCLC cell lines with
or without wild-type p53, radiosensitization by EGFR inhibitors is dependent on an increase in the levels of nonrepairable

DSB and disruption of the MEK–ERK pathway, suggesting
a common mechanism of radiosensitization across diverse
genetic backgrounds.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Cell lines were selected from a previously published panel
located in the Center for Molecular Therapeutics (CMT) at
Massachusetts General Hospital (6), except for A549 and Calu6 which were purchased directly from American Type Culture
Collection. Cell lines were obtained during 2009–2010 and
cultures passaged for less than 3 months after thawing a given
frozen vial. The identity of each of the cell lines in the panel
was tested using a set of 16 short tandem repeats (STR;
AmpFLSTR Identifier KIT; ABI). In addition, single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) profiles based on a panel of 63 SNPs
assayed using the Sequenom Genetic Analyzer was used for inhouse identity checking, whenever a cell line was propagated,
and confirmed uniqueness of cell lines for the ones without
available STR. No cell line was ever treated for Mycoplasma
and all lines tested Mycoplasma free prior to the experiments
(MycoAlert; Lonza).
A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM), Calu-6 in a-MEM, ABC1 and EBC1 in
DMEM/F12, and LU99B, NCI-H23, NCI-H3122, HCC44, NCIH460, EPLC-272, and NCI-H1869 in RPMI-1640 (all SigmaAldrich). All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 C and 5% CO2, with bovine growth serum (HyClone)
added to the medium at 10%. A549 clones with varying
p53 status were generated by transfection with linearized
expression vectors for the p53-273L or -179Q missense mutant
(30) or an empty cDNA3/neo vector using standard methods.
Stably transfected clones were selected with 500 mg/mL G418
(Mediatech) and maintained at 200 mg/mL G418.
Xenograft experiments
A549 xenografts were grown in nude mice (nu/nu; 7–14
weeks old) under published conditions in the Experimental
Centre of the Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technology
University of Dresden, Germany (31). The animal facilities and
the experiments were approved according to institutional
guidelines and animal welfare regulations. Erlotinib was given
orally at a standard dose of 50 mg/kg on days 0 to 4 after
tumors reached 7 mm diameter. X-ray irradiations (200 kV,
0.5 mm Cu, 1 Gy/min) were done on days 1 to 3 with 2 Gy/d.
An additional group of animals was treated with erlotinib
alone using the same schedule as described above. Control
tumors were either not treated or irradiated according to the
schedule above. Tumors were harvested on day 7, snap frozen,
and subjected to b-galactosidase staining.
Treatments
Irradiation was done using a Siemens Stabilipan 2 X-ray
generator operated at 250 kVp and 12 mA, at a dose rate of 1.98
Gy/min. Erlotinib and U0126 (LC Laboratory) were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide to generate 100 mmol/L stocks, and
cetuximab (Bristol-Myers Squipp) was obtained at 2 mg/mL.

EGFR Inhibition Causes DSB Inducible Senescence

Drugs were added 1 hour prior to irradiation and maintained
for the duration of the respective experiment.
Cell proliferation and survival assays
Clonogenic survival assays were done as previously published (32). Determination of cell numbers 72 hours after
irradiation was done by manual counting or by using a
fluorescent nucleic acid stain Syto60 as described (6, 33).
Senescence staining
Cells were seeded onto 8-well chamber slides and treated
after 24 hours. After 7 days, staining for senescence-associated
b-galactosidase was done using a commercial kit (Cell Signaling).
Flow cytometry
Cell-cycle distributions were determined using standard
ethanol fixation and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) staining
followed by flow cytometry (33). For quantification of g-H2AX
by flow cytometry, cells were counterstained with propidium
iodide and anti–g-H2AX antibody (ab18311; Abcam) followed
with staining with an Alexa-488–conjugated secondary antibody (A11029, Invitrogen) using a standard approach.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Staining and visualization of g-H2AX foci was done as
described (34). For visualization of p21 expression, the same
protocol was used. Following fixing and permeabilization,
cells were incubated with anti-p21 antibody (OP64; Calbiochem) followed by incubation with an Alexa 488–conjugated
secondary antibody (A11029; Invitrogen). All slides were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and examined
by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51).
Western blotting
Proteins in whole-cell lysates from exponentially growing
cell cultures were detected using standard methods. Specific
antibodies against phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated Erk,
total Akt, and total Erk (all Cell Signaling, #4058, 9101, 9272,
9102, respectively), trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9
(H3K9me3, ab8898; Abcam), and horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) were used. Protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence
(Invitrogen) followed by autoradiography.

Results
EGFR inhibition sensitizes irradiated NSCLC cells to
p53-dependent senescence
We sought to determine how the mechanisms of radiosensitization by erlotinib or cetuximab might affect not only
clonogenic cell survival but also short-term survival/proliferation, which is typically measured in cell line screens of
molecular-targeted drugs (6, 8). We initially employed A549
cells known to exhibit EGFR-dependent radioresistance (35).

EGFR phosphorylation induced by irradiation was blocked by
pharmacologically achievable concentrations of erlotinib (2
mmol/L) and cetuximab (100 nmol/L; data not shown). Erlotinib or cetuximab radiosensitized A549 cells to a similar
extent in a clonogenic survival assay (Fig. 1A). EGFR inhibition
also decreased the number of cells present at 72 hours after
irradiation with a clinically relevant dose (2 Gy) compared
with radiation alone (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).
Although we did not detect apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2),
there was a sustained increase in the fraction of cells in the G1
phase of the cell cycle following combined irradiation and
EGFR inhibition compared with radiation alone (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
A549 cells harbor wild-type p53, which triggers G1 cell-cycle
arrest in response to radiation and is also involved in aspects
of the radiation-induced G2-M block (36–38). Given the observed G1 cell-cycle arrest, we hypothesized that wild-type p53
may mediate radiosensitization through cellular senescence,
which is preceded by cell cycle or proliferative delay (20).
Indeed, we observed a prolonged induction of the cdk inhibitor p21 in irradiated cells with wild-type p53 that were treated
with erlotinib or cetuximab (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Consistent with this observation, we noticed downregulation of
the E2F1 transcription factor (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Examination of p53 wild-type cells revealed several features of
senescence, including morphologic characteristics indicating
premature differentiation and expression of senescence-associated b-galactosidase (Fig. 1B) as well as increased levels of
trimethylated histone H3K9 (Fig. 1C). Senescence impaired
the ability of irradiated cells to continue proliferation and
form colonies (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Importantly, senescence was detectable within 3 days of irradiation (Fig. 1C) and
thus likely contributed to the reduction in cell number seen at
that time point (Fig. 1A). Irradiated A549 xenografts exhibited
intense b-galactosidase staining in the presence of erlotinib,
thus confirming the senescence phenotype in vivo (Fig. 1D). Of
note, erlotinib or cetuximab alone caused neither p21 induction nor senescence in cell culture, although some baseline
senescence was observed in the xenograft setting (Supplementary Fig. S3D and data not shown).
To determine the p53 dependence of the observed senescence phenotype, we stably expressed dominant-negative
mutant forms of p53, that is, p53-273L or -179Q, in A549 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3E). Upon treatment of p53 mutant cells
with erlotinib or cetuximab cells, there was neither an increase
in p21 expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A) nor a reduction in
cell numbers at 72 hours postirradiation (Fig. 2A). Strikingly,
the p53-273L mutant completely abrogated radiosensitization
in a colony formation assay (Fig. 2A), whereas the disruptive
effect of the p53-179Q mutant was only slightly less pronounced (data not shown). Consistent with these findings,
cellular senescence induction was dependent on wild-type p53
function (Fig. 2B).
Cellular senescence is a dominant mechanism of
radiosensitization in NSCLC cell lines
Our data suggested that EGFR inhibition sensitizes NSCLC
cells with wild-type p53 to radiation via senescence, which can

be measured not only in a clonogenic assay but also in a 72hour proliferation/survival assay. We next asked whether this
phenomenon can be observed in different genetic backgrounds, particularly in cells with endogenous mutant p53
which potentially have the ability to induce senescence
through p53-independent mechanisms (20).
We screened 10 additional NSCLC cell lines using a previously established high-throughput platform which utilizes a
fluorescent nucleic acid stain, Syto60, to determine the number of cells present 72 hours after treatment initiation (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B) (6). Cell lines were ranked by the
ability of erlotinib to radiosensitize (Table 1, Supplementary
Fig. S4A). The ability of erlotinib alone to impair cell prolif-

eration did not correlate with the rank order of radiosensitization (Supplementary Fig. S4B). We next confirmed that the
presence of relative radiosensitization seen in the Syto60based assay predicted radiosensitization using colony formation (Table 1). This was done by calculating dose enhancement factors (DEF) to quantify the degree of
radiosensitization based on clonogenic survival differences
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Six cell lines including A549 (55%)
were radiosensitized by erlotinib with DEF ranging from 1.15
to 1.46 (mean, 1.28), and strikingly in 5 of these (83%), radiosensitization was associated with cellular senescence (Supplementary Fig. S6, Table 1). Importantly, as expected, there
was no correlation between the Syto60 and colony formation

assays with regard to the absolute radiosensitivity of individual cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Altogether, the data
indicate that cellular senescence is a dominant mechanism of
radiosensitization associated with EGFR inhibition.
With regard to effector pathways of the erlotinib-induced
senescence phenotype, we sought to determine whether the
p53 dependence that was observed for A549 cells could be
extended to other cell lines. We therefore expressed the
dominant-negative p53-273L mutant in LU99B cells and,
similar to A549 cells, found an abrogation of erlotinibmediated radiosensitization and senescence (Supplementary Fig. S7A–C). In contrast, NCI-H460 cells, which also
harbor wild-type p53, could not be radiosensitized by
erlotinib, possibly due to another mutation in a downstream pathway, though this was not investigated further.
With regard to the mechanism of senescence induction in
cell lines with endogenous mutant p53, we observed an
induction of p16 expression upon erlotinib and radiation
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7D), consistent with the
known role of this protein in p53-independent senescence
(20).
Senescence induction is associated with increased
levels of unrepaired DSB
Cellular senescence can be triggered by DSB, and it has been
suggested that inhibition of EGFR signaling impairs the

removal of radiation-induced DSB (20, 39). We first used
A549 cells to assess the levels of nonrepaired DSB at 1 to
7 days postirradiation by staining for the phosphorylated
histone variant g-H2AX which accumulates in foci at DSB.
g-H2AX foci accumulated in p21 expressing cells, suggesting a
link to senescence (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Correspondingly,
we detected a 13.4% increase in the fraction of cells with
nonrepaired DSB upon EGFR inhibition which was dependent
on wild-type p53 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the presence of wildtype p53 was associated with an EGFR inhibitor–mediated
increase in g-H2AX staining intensity primarily in the G1 phase
of the cell cycle and to a lesser extent in G2 (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S8B).
We also asked whether senescence can be induced by
simply increasing the levels of DSB even in the absence of
EGFR inhibition. Strikingly, when we disrupted DSB repair
with inhibitors of DNA-PKcs or ATM kinases, we observed
senescence after 2 Gy that was not seen with irradiation alone
(Supplementary Fig. S8C). A similar result was observed when
we merely increased the dose of radiation (Supplementary
Fig. S8D). Our data also show that neither ATM nor DNA-PKcs
kinase is required for execution of p53-mediated DSB inducible senescence in irradiated cells treated with cetuximab or
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S9A).
Next, to elucidate a common mechanism of radiosensitization in p53 wild-type A549 cells and the other NSCLC cell lines,

we investigated the ability of erlotinib to increase radiationinduced g-H2AX foci levels in a subset of lines. We observed a
strong correlation (P ¼ 0.01) between erlotinib-mediated
radiosensitization and levels of nonrepaired DSB at 24 hours
(Fig. 3C, Supplementary Fig. S9B and C).
DSB-mediated radiosensitization is dependent on the
MEK–ERK pathway
Because the MEK–ERK pathway promotes NHEJ in A549
cells (15) and erlotinib abrogates ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 4A), we asked whether MEK–ERK may prevent the
persistence of lethal DSB and constitute a suppressor pathway of radiation-induced senescence in NSCLC cells. Using
A549, ABC1, and HCC44 cells as representative examples, we
observed that treatment with a MEK inhibitor indeed increased the fraction of cells with residual g-H2AX foci by
8.2% to 18.1% (Fig. 4B), which was comparable with the
effects of EGFR inhibition in A549 cells (Fig. 3A). MEK
inhibition also caused p21 induction (Supplementary
Fig. S10A and B), radiosensitization (Fig. 4C), cellular senescence (Fig. 4D), and did not further enhance the radiosensitizing effects of erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S10C),
implicating the MEK–ERK pathway as one common effector
pathway of radioresistance downstream of EGFR. In contrast, disruption of the PI3K–AKT or JAK/STAT pathways
did not recapitulate the effects of EGFR or MEK inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S10D–F).

Discussion
We report here that inhibition of the EGFR triggers cellular
senescence in response to DSB produced by ionizing radiation
in 5 of 11 (45%) NSCLC cell lines (Table 1). EGFR inhibition
induced senescence following relatively low doses of radiation
(2 Gy) that are associated with approximately 50% clonogenic
cell survival. Importantly, EGFR inhibition alone using a dose
of 2 mmol/L did not cause senescence or even significantly
suppress proliferation in this set of cell lines, known to be
resistant to erlotinib in monotherapy (6).
The EGFR is expressed in 65% to 90% of NSCLC (40). In
approximately 10% of patients, EGFR acts as a cancer-driving
oncogene due to activating mutations in its tyrosine kinase
domain. However, its cancer-promoting functions in the
remaining cases are poorly understood. Our data lend support
to the hypothesis that EGFR may suppress cellular senescence
programs responding to low levels of endogenous DSB that
cause or are associated with genomic instability, thereby
promoting tumor progression. Our and other data imply that
genetic events, such as loss of p53 or p16 function that suffice
to overcome an oncogene-induced senescence barrier as a
prerequisite of tumor formation, may not necessarily codisrupt the availability of therapy-inducible senescence (21, 41,
42).
What are the mechanisms by which EGFR suppresses
DSB inducible senescence? An analysis of radiobiological

EGFR Inhibition Causes DSB Inducible Senescence

Figure 3. Effect of EGFR inhibition on residual DNA DSBs as measured by
g-H2AX staining in NSCLC cells. A, fraction of nuclei with 20 or more
g-H2AX foci at 24 hours after irradiation (8 Gy IR) of p53 wild-type or
mutant (273L) A549 cells with or without cetuximab treatment. Data are
based on 2 independent repeat experiments. B, fraction of A549 cells with
high levels of g-H2AX staining distributed over the G1 and G2-M cell cycles

Supplementary Fig. S8B. Data are based on 2 independent repeat
experiments. C, relative increase in the levels of residual g-H2AX foci 24
hours after irradiation caused by EGFR inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S9B)
is plotted against relative radiosensitization based on short-term cell
survival/proliferation (Fig. 4A) in a panel of NSCLC cell lines. Data are fitted
by a linear regression line, and 95% confidence limits are depicted as
dotted lines. Data point for A549 p53-mut represents p53-mutant A549
cells treated with cetuximab (Fig. 2A).

parameters determining clonogenic survival revealed an increase in the a/b ratio as described by the linear quadratic
formula (43) in 4 of the 5 cell lines undergoing senescence, that
is, A549, H3122, ABC1, and HCC44 (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
These data suggest a reduction in the contribution of so-called

sublethal damage to the observed loss of clonogenicity, that is,
reduced b-component indicating repairable DSB (44), and a
concomitant increase in lethal lesions, that is, increased
a-component consistent with nonrepairable DSB. We postulate that prolonged cell-cycle arrest and subsequent senescence are a logical cellular response to the presence of
nonrepairable DSB. In support of this mechanism, EGFR
inhibition increased the levels of residual g-H2AX foci after
irradiation in several cell lines (Fig. 3C, Supplementary
Fig. S9B and C). Altogether, these data suggest that EGFR
commonly promotes the removal of repairable DSB from the
genome.
Recently, investigators reported that EGFR can translocate
into the nucleus upon irradiation, where it may promote NHEJ
through an interaction with DNA-PKcs (35, 45, 46). Other data
indicate that MEK–ERK signaling may stimulate NHEJ in
NSCLC (A549) and glioma cells (15, 47). Our data provide
evidence for a common role of MEK–ERK in modulating the
levels of radiation-induced DSB in NSCLC cells (Fig. 4B–D;
model Supplementary Fig. S11A). A possible mechanism is
suggested by the interesting observation that ERK signaling
can activate PARP-1 which has a role in NHEJ (48, 49).
However, we believe it is unlikely that EGFR–MEK–ERK
suppresses DSB inducible senescence through only a single
mechanism, that is, by reducing the number of persistent DSB.
A prerequisite for p53-mediated senescence is the arrest of
cells in the G1 phase following the induction of DSB (29).
Interestingly, ERK has been shown to promote G1-S transition
through multiple mechanisms, and nuclear translocation is
required for S-phase entry (50). Thus, loss of ERK signaling
may cooperate with p53 to halt cells in G1. However, ERK has
also been shown to contribute to p53 activation through
serine 15 phosphorylation, at least after UV irradiation (51).
Thus, the functional interaction of ERK signaling with p53, or
with the p16 pathway in the absence of p53 (29), in the
regulation of senescence is likely complex. The genes encoding
p53 and p16 are among the most commonly mutated tumor
suppressors in human cancers. Our data suggest that in
cancers that have mutated either of these genes, the presence
of the other unaltered gene product can be therapeutically
exploited for DSB inducible senescence. For example, p16
mutant A549 cells undergo p53-mediated DSB inducible senescence, whereas p16-mediated senescence may be activated
in p53 mutant ABC1 cells (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S11A).
Other genomic determinants of radiosensitization are
likely to exist but are not readily apparent from the cell
line profile data available (Table 1 and data not shown).
Much larger cell line panels are needed to establish genotypes that correlate with radiosensitization. With regard to
the importance of histologic cancer subtype, the 3 squamous
cell cancer cell lines in our panel could not be radiosensitized by erlotinib (Table 1) or cetuximab (Wang and colleagues, unpublished data). However, there is at least one
published lung squamous cell cancer cell line that can be
radiosensitized by erlotinib (13). Thus, it remains to be
determined whether any histologic subtype exists, such as
adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma, that can
be preferentially radiosensitized.

alone does not cause senescence in these
cell lines (data not shown). IR, ionizing
radiation.

Finally, our data suggest that the use of short-term cell
survival/proliferation as a readout for the efficacy of lowdose radiation and EGFR inhibitors accurately predicts
radiosensitization in a colony formation assay because
the senescence response underlying radiosensitization is
associated with a cell proliferative delay that is captured
with the short-term assay (Supplementary Fig. S11B). In
other words, even though short-term survival/proliferation
assays may not provide a surrogate for "absolute" radiosensitivity (as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S4C), they can
provide a measure of "relative" radiosensitization in a given
cell line when radiation is combined with a potentially
radiosensitizing and senescence-inducing drug, at least in
the case of EGFR or MEK/ERK inhibitors. Thus, assays able
to capture the proliferative delay that is associated with
senescence should be useful for screening large cell line
panels to identify genomic biomarkers of EGFR inhibitor–
mediated radiosensitization. Future studies should also be
directed at determining the contribution of different cellular
responses to radiation/drug combinations by using multiplex assessments of apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, in
addition to senescence (52), all of which may contribute to

the cytotoxic effects of radiation plus a targeted agent in
patients.
