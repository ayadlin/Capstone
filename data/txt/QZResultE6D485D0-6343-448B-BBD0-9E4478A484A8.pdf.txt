ABSTRACT
The therapeutic response and clinical outcome of patients diagnosed with the
same cancer type and that receive identical treatment is highly variable to reflect the
genetic heterogeneity within tumor cells. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are recently
discovered molecules that regulate eukaryotic gene expression and represent a
significant advance towards a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern
cellular growth. NcRNAs are essential for the proper regulation of cell proliferation
and survival under physiologic conditions and are deregulated in many pathologies,
e.g., human cancers. NcRNAs have been associated with cancer diagnosis, staging,
treatment response, metastasis and survival and include distinct subtypes, e.g., long
ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). LncRNAs have been linked to essential
growth-promoting activities and their deregulation contributes to tumor cell survival.
A prominent example is the Hox transcript antisense intergenic lncRNA, HOTAIR,
that cooperates with the polycomb repressive complex to reprogram chromatin
organization. HOTAIR expression is deregulated in a spectrum of cancers and HOTAIR
expression correlates with patient survival. Here, we highlight emerging evidence
that supports a role for lncRNAs in cancer with implications for the development of
novel diagnostics and therapeutics.

cancers, e.g., acute lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large
B cell lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and germ cell
tumors. However, drug resistance inevitably emerges in
most cancer types to hinder patient response [11–21].
Numerous mechanisms may explain the molecular
basis of drug resistance and treatment failure. Resistance
results from genetic variations within the patient’s tumor
cell. Recently, the dormant state of cancer stem cells
and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition have been
linked to chemotherapeutic resistance [22–27]. While the
design of cancer chemotherapy has become increasingly
sophisticated, few agents universally prevent disease
relapse. A common mechanism for the acquisition of
resistance is expression of energy-dependent transporters
that eject anticancer drugs from cells [28–30]. Induction
of drug detoxification, reduced sensitivity to apoptotic
signals, uncoupling of growth control and inactivation of

INTRODUCTION
Cancer remains a major challenge in modern
medicine [1–6]. Despite improved diagnostics, an arsenal
of FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs and targeted therapies,
cancer remains a leading cause of death, a major economic
burden and a severe limitation on patient quality-of-life.
Moreover, in developed countries, cancer mortality has
remained relatively constant for the past 35 years. Almost
all of the ~500,000 annual cancer deaths in the U.S.
are due, at least in part, to drug resistance [4–7]. Drug
resistance, either de novo or acquired, still accounts for the
majority of tumor relapses contributing to poor outcomes
[6–10]. Drug combinations may prevent the emergence of
resistance since a clone resistant to a single agent is more
readily eradicated by multiple agents from different drug
classes. Such a strategy has improved survival in certain

cell death pathways all promote drug resistance in cancer
cells. Recent evidence points to a relationship between
the drug-resistant phenotype and epigenetic alterations
within cancer cells [31–33]. Non-coding (ncRNAs) are
major regulators of epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene expression. NcRNAs have also been
reported to play a role in chemoresistance by impairing the
response through cell cycle arrest, inhibition of apoptosis
and enhanced DNA damage repair [34–37]. Here, we
describe the rapidly emerging role of long ncRNAs
(lncRNAs) in cancer drug resistance and highlight a
prominent example, the lncRNA HOTAIR, to correlate
lncRNA expression with metastasis, drug resistance and
clinical outcome [38–40].

a 60 to 110nt hairpin precursor (pre-miRNA) that is
transcribed from a larger primary transcript (pri-miRNA).
MiRNAs bind target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts
through sequence complementarity to either promote
mRNA degradation or to prevent mRNA translation.
While much is known about miRNAs, little exists
regarding the biology and function of lncRNAs. While
the precise functions of individual lncRNAs in cancer is
only beginning to emerge, it is evident that ncRNAs are
essential for tumorigenesis [68–71].

LncRNA HOTAIR AND HUMAN
CANCERS
LncRNAs are a heterogeneous group of RNAs
that regulate expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional
or post-transcriptional level [72–76]. LncRNAs bind
specific gene clusters to not only prevent the binding
of transcriptional activators but also recruit chromatin
remodeling proteins as a molecular scaffold to silence
gene expression. LncRNA can also interact with chromatin
modifying proteins in trans to epigenetically silence
genes at distant loci. LncRNA transcription may open the
chromatin structure and permit access to the transcriptional
machinery and enhance expression of neighboring proteincoding genes. Similarly, transcription of lncRNAs near
protein-coding loci can repress transcription since the
presence of the transcriptional machinery on the lncRNA
gene locus physically prevents binding to protein-coding
genes. The post-transcriptional roles of lncRNAs are
more diverse. Since many lncRNAs are complementary
to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs may function in mRNA
splicing, editing, transport, translation and degradation.
Although lncRNAs are best known for modulating
transcription, their post-transcriptional influence on
mRNA translation is emerging. Recently, HOTAIR was
shown to be a post-translational inducer of ubiquitinmediated proteolysis. HOTAIR associates with certain
E3 ubiquitin ligases bearing RNA-binding domains, such
as Dzip3 and Mex3b, as well as with their respective
ubiquitination substrates, Ataxin-1 and Snurportin-1 [88].
HOTAIR facilitates the ubiquitination of Ataxin-1 by
Dzip3 and Snurportin-1 by Mex3b and accelerates their
degradation. These studies have uncovered a fascinating
and unforeseen role for HOTAIR in protein degradation.
The hallmarks of cancer comprise biological
capabilities acquired during the multistep development
of tumors [78, 79]. These features constitute an
organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities
of cancer and include sustaining proliferative signaling,
evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death,
enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis,
and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying
these hallmarks is the common thread of genomic
instability to generate the diversity that expedites tumor

NcRNAs AND CANCER
Studies have revealed that protein-coding and nonprotein-coding genes are extensively transcribed within
the human genome [41–44]. Protein-coding and nonprotein-coding RNAs, such as long and short ncRNAs,
are found on all human chromosomes (Figure 1A). This
has led to the identification of novel classes of ncRNAs
that regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms.
NcRNAs are deregulated or mutated in diseased cells from
many human cancers [45–48]. NcRNAs represent a broad
class of structurally and functionally distinct RNAs. These
include long and short ncRNAs that represent a significant
proportion (~60%) of the RNAs distributed throughout
the human genome (Figure 1B) [49–52]. The distribution
of lncRNAs and different short ncRNA types within the
human genome is shown (Figure 1C).
For nearly four decades, mutation, amplification
or deletions within protein-coding oncogenes and/or
tumor suppressors was considered the primary cause
of tumorigenesis [53–57]. This thinking has recently
been revisited with the discovery of ncRNAs [58–60].
Thousands of genes that produce long or short ncRNA
transcripts without any significant open reading frame
have demonstrated that the complexity of cancer cell
genetics is far greater than expected. These results led
to a paradigm shift in addressing cancer biology and
approaches in cancer treatment.
NcRNAs do not encode proteins but studies have
documented their role during the steps of tumorigenesis
and the development of therapeutic resistance [61–64].
NcRNAs are differentially expressed in a number of
cancer types relative to the surrounding healthy (normal)
tissue [65–67]. Importantly, many of the same ncRNAs
appear to be commonly deregulated in multiple tumor
types. While ncRNAs are newcomers in genome biology,
these findings indicate that ncRNAs directly modulate
key pathways that promote cancer growth. MiRNAs
range from 18–25 nucleotides (nt) while lncRNAs extend
up to >10,000nt. MiRNAs typically are excised from

serves as a modular scaffold, assembling a molecular
cargo of specific combinations of enzymes that are
equipped to regulate target genes [86]. Further studies
then demonstrated that HOTAIR reprograms chromatin
organization and in breast cancer cells promotes
metastatic potential [87].

LncRNA expression and metastasis, drug
resistance and overall survival

LncRNAs that correlate with metastasis

The Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA
HOTAIR is expressed from the developmental HOXC
locus located on chromosome 12q13.13 and cooperates
with the polycomb repressive complex PRC2 [83].
This 2.2kb spliced RNA transcript interacts with the
PRC2 to modify chromatin and repress transcription
of the HOX genes [84, 85]. Although less than 2% of a
mammalian genome codes for protein, at least 50% is
transcribed [85]. Recently it was shown that HOTAIR

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HOTAIR expression has been investigated in
tumor samples from many different cancer types.
Healthy and cancer tissue was compared to demonstrate
that HOTAIR is deregulated in many tumor types
(Figure 3A). HOTAIR expression from patients diagnosed
with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) and liver metastases
was shown to correlate with a poor prognosis [89]. In
addition, high expression of HOTAIR correlated with

the presence of liver metastases. MALAT1 (metastasisassociated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is another
lncRNA that has been associated with metastasis and poor
prognosis for patients with NSCLC [90]. MALAT1 resides
on chromosome 11q13.1 which has been found to harbor
chromosomal translocation breakpoints linked to cancer
[91, 92]. Other in vitro studies, have implicated MALAT1
in the regulation of the invasive potential of cancer cells,
in cervical [93] and lung cancers [94].

[95]. CUDR expression correlates with tumorigenesis as
well as cellular growth [96]. CUDR has been shown to
render resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide, commonly
used for squamous cell cancer. The growth arrest-specific 5
lncRNA Gas5 contributes to glucocorticoid resistance [97].
Gas5 exerts its effects by assuming a secondary structure
that is similar to a sequence within the steroid-responsive
gene promoter. The result is that Gas5 competitively
inhibits steroid receptor binding to the steroid-responsive
region of the promoter to prevent transcriptional activation.
A role as a tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma has
also recently been reported [98]. PANDA is a lncRNA
increased in a subset of breast cancer cells that contributes
to anthracycline resistance, a crucial component of breast
cancer chemotherapy [99]. PANDA acts by interacting
with the nuclear transcription factor NF-YA to decrease

the apoptotic effect. PANDA-depleted fibroblasts have been
shown to display increased sensitivity to chemotherapy
[100]. A large intergenic ncRNA induced by p53 mediates
global gene repression and many p53-regulated lncRNAs
are induced in response to DNA damage and promote
chemoresistance. H19 knockdown by transfection with
antisense H19 oligonucleotides suppresses the multi-drug
resistance gene and promotes doxorubicin sensitivity [101,
102]. Finally, HULC is a 1.6 kb lncRNA that may act as
an endogenous sponge to reduce miRNA levels and inhibit
their functional activity [103, 104].

Hotair expression correlates with
overall survival
HOTAIR expression in tissue from patients
diagnosed with either non-small cell lung, colorectal,
breast or cervical cancers was the correlated with five
year overall survival (Figure 3b.) We found that patients
with increased HOTAIR expression had a worse survival
in all four cancer types studied. These and related studies
may soon lead to the development of lncRNA signatures
that classify patients into high and low-risk groups with
significantly different survival rates. The prognostic

independent data sets but the identification of prognostic
lncRNAs indicates their potential.

of RNA expression to treat cancer has recently gained
momentum as a treatment modality since growthpromoting lncRNAs may be inactivated through antisense
technologies. LncRNAs may also function as mRNA or
miRNA sponges to inactivate growth-promoting, protumorigenic signaling pathway. Therefore, syntheticallyengineered lncRNAs may be employed through
replacement therapy to inhibit tumor cells [111]. Cancer
cells have increased the protein synthesizing machinery as
well as enhanced ncRNA transcription rates making RNA
interference an attractive strategy. NcRNAs offer potential
as therapeutic targets is exemplified by Onconase, a nonspecific ribonuclease which neutralizes tRNA, rRNA,
mRNAs and ncRNAs. Onconase, currently in phase II
trials, induces a G1 block in the cell cycle and increased
apoptosis [112]. Delivery vehicles, e.g., liposomal
membranes, carry growth-inhibitory ncRNAs into tumor
cells as another lncRNA-based treatment strategy. MRX34
is a ncRNA-based therapeutic that targets miR-34 is being
evaluated in clinical trials for hepatocellular cancers [113,
114]. The absence of nucleases within the cerebral spinal
fluid (CSF) has made intrathecal injection of RNA-based
agents an attractive approach to treat neurodegenerative
diseases. Primary brain tumors and brain metastases
may similarly be targeted. Nanoparticles that deliver
RNA inhibitors are also emerging [115–117]. Dextran
nanoparticles can deliver chemotherapy to the nucleus and
may be used to attach cytotoxic agents to lncRNAs. The
plasmid DTA-H19 was designed by express a diphtheria
toxin subunit controlled under the H19 promoter [118,
119]. Intratumoral injection of this compound can lead
to a H19-dependent activation of diphtheria toxin within
the tumor. Another emerging modality is to increase
tumor suppressor activity by neutralizing the inhibitory
of effect of lncRNAs through antisense oligonucleotides.
These compounds do not need any delivery vehicle and
can be injected subcutaneously and are directly taken up
by cells. They can cross endosomal membranes, enter
the nucleus and inhibit PRC2 interaction with lncRNAs.
These compounds may also cross the blood brain barrier
without the need of a lipid carrier.

HOTAIR REGULATION OF CHROMATIN
REMODELING
In a subset of 32 CRC specimens, gene set
enrichment analysis revealed a correlation between
HOTAIR expression and the PRC2 complex members,
namely SUZ12, EZH2 and H3K27me3 [106]. HOTAIR
may be associated with the genome-wide reprogramming
of PRC2 in a broad number of tumor types.
Approximately 20% of the identified lncRNAs regulate
the transcriptional activity of protein-coding genes by
guiding the histone methyltransferase PRC2 to specific
genomic loci. Chemotherapy has been shown to induce
epigenetic changes which contribute to the emergence
of drug resistance [107]. We correlated the cross-cancer
alteration of HOTAIR through either mutation, deletion,
amplification with a broad number of cancer types
(Figure 4A) [108]. HOTAIR was significantly deregulated
in a significant percentage of patients from the different
cancer types examined.
HOTAIR contains 6,232bp and encodes a 2.2kb
lncRNA located within a HOXC gene cluster. It is shuttled
from chromosome 12 to chromosome 2 by Suz-Twelve.
The 5' end of HOTAIR interacts with PRC2 and as a result
regulates chromatin state. The 3' end of HOTAIR interacts
with the histone demethylase LSD1. PRC2 consists of
four subunits: Suz12, Eed, Ezh1 or Ezh2 (SET domain
with histone methyltransferase activity and RbAp48
(histone-binding domain). HOTAIR may contribute to
the regulation and functioning of the PRC2 subunits. In
addition to HOTAIR, a correlation between alterations
in EED1 was also seen across the different cancer types
[Figure 4B]. Future studies will further define the role of
HOTAIR on PRC2, chromatin remodeling and individual
components, e.g., EED1, of PRC2.

LncRNA THERAGNOSTICS

CONCLUSIONS

Theragnostics, a portmanteau of therapeutics and
diagnostics, describes a system to customize healthcare
using molecular and genetic tools for treatment decisions
tailored to the individual patient. LncRNAs are therefore
perfectly tailored as cancer theragnostics to design
personalized medicines based upon molecular features
of each tumor [109, 110]. Novel cancer diagnostics,
prognostics and anti-cancer strategies based upon
ncRNA biology are rapidly emerging. For example,
lncRNAs isolated from tumor cells or circulating within
the bloodstream may provide for readily-available,
inexpensive and stable blood-borne diagnostics to more
readily detect cancers and cancer subtypes. Interference

LncRNAs are rapidly being recognized as important
regulators of gene expression in cancer. The evolutionary
conservation, diversity and complexity of lncRNAs
indicates that they exert significant regulatory control on
cell growth. While understanding the mechanistic role
of lncRNA in cancer is still early, general principles are
emerging. LncRNAs, e.g., HOTAIR, are deregulated in
many cancer types, affect signaling pathways that promote
cancer and modulate gene expression. Future studies will
identify similar lncRNAs leading to signatures to better
diagnose cancers. LncRNAs should allow for better

Conflicts of interest

stratification of cancer subtypes to correlate lncRNA
expression with therapeutic response, drug resistance and
overall survival. Similar to miRNA expression profiling
in multiple myeloma and related B cell malignancies,
lncRNAs profiling should lead to the identification of
genetic subtypes and their association with treatment
response and survival [120–122]. Finally, the structural
and functional novelty of lncRNAs offers promise as
anticancer therapeutics that may avoid the emergence
of drug resistance commonly seen with the currently
used agents. Studies to better understand the molecular
mechanisms of lncRNAs in cancer offers promise for the
development of more effective cancer therapies.
