ABSTRACT
High activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is associated with
poor prognosis in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), suggesting that
inhibiting mTOR might be clinically useful. However, emerging data indicate that
mTOR inhibitors are most effective when combined with other target agents. One
strategy is to combine with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, since B-ALL is
often characterized by epigenetic changes that silence the expression of pro-apoptotic
factors. Here we tested combinations of mTOR and pan-HDAC inhibitors on B-ALL
cells, including both Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and non-Ph cell lines.
We found that mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs) synergize with HDAC inhibitors to
cause apoptosis in B-ALL cells and the effect is greater when compared to rapamycin
plus HDAC inhibitors. The combination of TOR-KIs with the clinically approved HDAC
inhibitor vorinostat increased apoptosis in primary pediatric B-ALL cells in vitro.
Mechanistically, TOR-KI and HDAC inhibitor combinations increased expression of prodeath genes, including targets of the Forkhead Box O (FOXO) transcription factors,
and increased sensitivity to apoptotic triggers at the mitochondria. These findings
suggest that targeting epigenetic factors can unmask the cytotoxic potential of TORKIs towards B-ALL cells.

INTRODUCTION

mTOR integrates signals from growth factors, nutrient
availability and cell stress to produce an appropriate
cellular response to growth conditions. The mTOR enzyme
acts in two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2,
with different regulation and downstream substrates [8,
10]. The classical mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAP)
and its analogs (rapalogs) bind to an allosteric site in
the mTORC1 complex and reduce mTORC1 activity
towards some but not all substrates [11-13]. Newer ATPcompetitive mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs) suppress
phosphorylation of all mTORC1 and mTORC2 substrates
[14, 15].
In cancer cells, oncogene activation leads to
elevated mTOR activity, promoting survival and
biosynthetic processes necessary for cell division [1618]. There is strong interest in targeting mTOR for cancer

B-ALL is the most common malignancy in
children and also affects adults [1, 2]. B-ALL is generally
responsive to standard chemotherapy, but a subset of
patients have poor prognosis. Among these high-risk
cases, around 30% of adult B-ALL have the Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph+); the percentage of Ph+ is much lower
in pediatric B-ALL. However, a subset of “Ph-like”
B-ALLs have elevated tyrosine kinase activity [3-5],
raising the possibility of treatment with TKIs or agents
targeting downstream components like mTOR. Elevated
mTOR signaling correlates with poor prognosis in B-ALL
patients [6, 7], making it a promising therapeutic target.
The serine/threonine kinase mTOR has an important
role in cell growth, proliferation and survival [8, 9].

therapy, in part based on genetic studies showing selective
effects on tumor cells following mTOR inactivation [19,
20]. TOR-KIs have promising anti-tumor activity in
preclinical models and several candidate compounds are
in clinical trials [21-23]. Evidence is growing that TORKIs and rapalogs are most effective against cancer cells
when used in combination with other therapies [24-28].
For example, we have reported that the tool compound
PP242 and an investigation agent, MLN0128, potentiate
the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in B-ALL
cells expressing the BCR-ABL oncoprotein [27, 28]. In a
mouse BCR-ABL-dependent leukemia model, PP242 was
more effective than RAP when combined with the BCRABL TKI imatinib [27].
Many B-ALLs carry translocations involving
transcription factors [2], and genomic studies indicate
that loss of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) is common
[29, 30]. This suggests that targeting epigenetic factors,
particularly histone deacetylases (HDAC), might have
therapeutic benefit in B-ALL. The pan-HDAC inhibitor
(HDACi) vorinostat is FDA-approved for cutaneous T
cell lymphoma [31]. mTOR inhibitors have potential
to suppress survival signaling, possibly enhancing
the efficacy of HDACi. This concept is supported by
preclinical studies of acute myeloid leukemia and
hepatocellular carcinoma [32, 33], and is being tested in
multiple clinical trials involving rapalogs combined with
vorinostat or panobinostat (NCI clinical trial identifiers
NCT00918333, NCT01341834, NCT01169532). A phase
I trial of panobinostat and the rapalog everolimus reported
15% complete response rate in Hodgkins’ lymphoma [34].
The effect of combining TOR-KIs and HDACi in B-ALL
has not been reported.
We hypothesized that TOR-KIs might provide
better efficacy than RAP when combined with HDACi
in B-ALL. By blocking mTORC2, TOR-KIs reduce AKT
activity and should increase the function of transcription
factors in the Forkhead Box O (FOXO) family, leading to
upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes [35]. We found that
in human B-ALL cells, TOR-KIs are mainly cytostatic
as single agents. Hence we tested whether HDACi could
unleash the cytotoxic potential of TOR-KIs through
epigenetic de-silencing of pro-apoptotic genes. The results
show that HDACi increase the cytotoxic effects of TORKIs in B-ALL cell lines and primary B-ALL specimens.
B-ALL cell killing by the HDACi/TOR-KI combination
correlates with upregulation of FOXO target gene
expression.

mTOR inhibition promotes cell cycle arrest but
not death of B-ALL cells
TOR-KIs provide significant anti-leukemic effects
in vitro and in vivo using both murine and human models
of B-ALL [27, 28, 36]. Consistent with our previous
study using PP242 [27], the clinical candidate compound
MLN0128 [28] caused both cell death (Fig. 1A) and G0/
G1 arrest (Fig. 1C) in BCR-ABL-transformed murine
pre-B cells (p190 cells). In contrast, human Ph+ cell lines
(SUP-B15 and BV-173), Ph-negative cell lines (Nalm-6,
Blin-1, RS11;4, 697, REH, SEM, Kasumi-2) and primary
cells from bone marrow of pediatric B-ALL patients
(Ph-negative) were less sensitive to MLN0128 induced
cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and Supplementary
Figure S1). In agreement with our previous findings
[27], TOR-KIs caused greater cell cycle arrest and death
in p190 cells than rapamycin (Fig. 1A, C). Similarly,
MLN0128 caused greater cell cycle arrest than rapamycin
in SUP-B15 cells (Fig. 1C).

HDAC inhibitors synergize with TOR-KIs to
overcome B-ALL death resistance
Clinically relevant concentrations of the FDAapproved HDACi, vorinostat [37-42], did not affect the
viability of a panel of Ph+ or non-Ph human B-ALL cell
lines (Fig. 2A, 2B, S1). However, vorinostat significantly
increased MLN0128-mediated cytotoxicity of Ph+ and
non-Ph B-ALL cell lines (Fig. 2A, 2B and S1). Similar
results were obtained using distinct combinations of
TOR-KIs with pan-HDACi: AZD8055 with vorinostat
(Fig. S2A), MLN0128 with panobinostat (Fig. 2C),
or MLN0128 with Apicidin (data not shown). The
combination of MLN0128 plus vorinostat caused
significantly more death than rapamycin plus vorinostat
(Fig. S2B), indicating an advantage of TOR-KIs relative
to rapamycin.
The MLN0128/vorinostat combination showed
a strong synergistic effect in the Ph+ cell line SUP-B15
(Fig. 2A) as well as the non-Ph cell line Nalm-6 (Fig.
2B). While the MLN0128/vorinostat combination
enhanced cytotoxicity for all but one B-ALL cell line
(REH, see Fig. S1) relative to single agent treatments, the
magnitude of difference as well as inhibitor concentrations
differed among the B-ALL cell lines. The heterogeneous
response in cell lines prompted us to test the MLN0128/
vorinostat combination on primary B-ALL cells. For these
experiments, we maintained survival of pediatric B-ALL
specimens by culturing on immortalized stromal cells
as described previously [28]. MLN0128 alone caused a
small increase in B-ALL death (Fig. 3A), consistent with

the data in Fig. 1A. Vorinostat alone had no effect, but
significantly enhanced B-ALL killing when added together
with MLN0128 in each individual primary B-ALL
specimen (Fig. 3A).

was further increased by MLN0128 (Fig. 3B). Titrating
MLN0128 (10 – 750 nM) and vorinostat (50 – 3750 nM)
confirmed greater effects on B cells than CD4+ T cells or
CD4-CD19- cells (Fig. S3A, S3B).
Previously we reported that PP242 has minimal
effects on survival and function of mouse T and B cells,
when used at concentrations with anti-leukemic potential
[27]. Similarly, MLN0128 at concentrations below 100
nM did not reduce survival of purified mouse splenic B
cells cultured in the presence of cytokines IL-4 and BAFF
(Fig. S3C). Vorinostat at concentrations below 1000 nM
had minimal effect on mouse B cell survival (Fig. S3C).
MLN0128 (100 nM) did increase death of mouse B cells
but this was not increased further by vorinostat (500 nM)
(Fig. 3C). The survival of mouse splenic T cells cultured
in IL-7 and IL-15 was modestly reduced by treatment
with MLN0128 and/or vorinostat (Fig. 3C, S3C). Overall
these data suggest that MLN0128 and vorinostat, when
combined at concentrations that cause B-ALL cell death,
have little effect on human and mouse T cells but show
cytotoxicity towards normal B cells.

Survival of normal lymphocytes treated with
TOR-KIs plus HDACi
To evaluate the selectivity of the MLN0128/
vorinostat combination for leukemia cells, we applied
this drug combination to peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) from normal human donors. After 48 hr
of treatment, both MLN0128 (100 nM) and vorinostat
(500 nM) slightly increased death of PBMC but the
combination did not cause more death than MLN0128
alone (Fig. 3B). Gating on lymphocyte subpopulations
showed that CD4+ T cells were largely resistant to
MLN0128 or vorinostat alone or in combination (Fig. 3B).
A significant but quantitatively small increase in killing
was seen in the CD4-CD19- population (mostly CD8 T
cells and natural killer cells) when treated with MLN0128
plus vorinostat. CD19+ B cells showed a high rate of
spontaneous death following 48 hr in vitro culture, and this

MLN0128/vorinostat induces apoptosis in B-ALL
cells

that was significantly higher than in cells treated with
single agents (Fig. S4). Together these data support
apoptosis as the cytotoxic mechanism of action for the
MLN0128/vorinostat combination in B-ALL cells.

B-ALL cell killing by combination treatment might
induce cytotoxicity through necrosis or programmed cell
death (i.e. apoptosis). The pan-caspase inhibitor QVDOPH caused a concentration-dependent suppression
of apoptosis in SUP-B15 cells treated with MLN0128/
vorinostat (Fig. 4A), consistent with death by caspasedependent apoptosis. The combination of MLN0128/
vorinostat also increased PARP cleavage, a caspasedependent event in apoptotic cells (Fig. 4B). We did not
consistently detect cleaved caspases by immunoblot or
flow cytometry (data not shown), perhaps owing to low
levels of caspase expression in B-ALL cells [43, 44].
However, using enzyme assays we observed a transient
increase in activity of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 in
three B-ALL cell lines treated with MLN0128/vorinostat

Broad spectrum HDACi like vorinostat have the
potential to alter cellular signal transduction through
altered transcription or non-histone target proteins.
To investigate the mechanism of synergistic killing of
B-ALL cells by MLN0128/vorinostat, we first assessed
phosphorylation of signaling proteins in the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway. As expected, vorinostat increased
global histone acetylation in SUP-B15 cells; however,
vorinostat did not affect phosphorylation of proteins in
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Fig. 5A). In contrast,

MLN0128 treatment reduced phosphorylation of the
mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1 (T37/46) and the mTORC2
substrate AKT (S473), with only a slight effect on
histone acetylation (Fig. 5A). MLN0128 also blocked
phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (S240/244)
downstream of mTORC1 (Fig. 5A). Similar results were
observed in the Blin-1 and Nalm-6 cell lines (data not
shown). MLN0128 and vorinostat did not influence ERK
phosphorylation in SUP-B15 cells (Fig. 5A). These data
suggest that vorinostat does not alter the activity of major
oncogenic signaling pathways in B-ALL cell lines, nor
does vorinostat modulate the signaling impact of TORKIs.
Next we considered possible changes in
transcription factor activity. We noted that MLN0128
reduced phosphorylation of FOXO transcription factors
in SUP-B15 cells (Fig. 5A). The FOXO family of
transcription factors (FOXO1, FOXO3A, and FOXO4)
function as redundant tumor suppressors in lymphocytes
[45]. Activated AKT enters the nucleus and phosphorylates
FOXO proteins, inhibiting their binding to DNA and
promoting nuclear export [46]. Through this mechanism,
PI3K/AKT signaling prevents FOXO-mediated
transcription of target genes that promote cell cycle arrest

and apoptosis [47, 48]. Of the known AKT substrates,
phosphorylation of FOXO proteins is particularly
sensitive to reduced mTORC2 activity and AKT-S473
phosphorylation [49, 50]. As we observed previously
in PP242-treated p190 cells [27], MLN0128 promoted
nuclear localization of FOXO1 in SUP-B15 cells (Fig.
5B). This led us to investigate further the potential role of
FOXO in the cytotoxic effects of MLN0128/vorinostat.
First we assessed expression of FOXO target
genes. Treatment of SUP-B15 cells with MLN0128
strongly upregulated mRNA expression of the cell cycle
inhibitors p27 and p130, with lesser effects on the proapoptotic targets BIM or TRAIL (Fig. 5C). Next we tested
the potential of FOXO factors to regulate cell death in
SUP-B15 cells. Inducible activation of constitutively
active FOXO factors (FOXO1-A3 or FOXO3A-A3)
increased cell death by ~20% at 48hr, and by ~40% in
combination with vorinostat (Fig. 5D). This indicates that
forced activation of FOXO factors has a similar pro-death
effect compared to TOR-KIs.
To obtain a broader view of gene expression changes
following single or dual treatments, we used a PCR array
to measure mRNAs for 90 genes regulating apoptosis. A
heat map of the results shows that 8hr of treatment with

SUP-B15 cells were treated for 4 hr with vehicle or 100 nM MLN0128. mRNA was obtained and expression of the indicated gene products

domain of the estrogen receptor (ER). Cells were then treated with vehicle or 4OHT for 48hr in the absence or presence of vorinostat (500
nM). The percentage of cell death was determined after 48 hr by 7-AAD staining (mean +/- SEM, n = 3). * p < 0.05; paired two-tailed t-test.

vorinostat broadly increased expression of pro-apoptotic
genes while reducing expression of pro-survival genes
(Fig. S5). Combined treatment with vorinostat and
MLN0128 also increased mRNA expression of a number
of pro-apoptotic genes (Fig. S5). Several of these genes are
known FOXO targets: FASLG (Fas ligand), GADD45A,
TNFSF10 (TRAIL), TNFRSF10A (death receptor-4
(DR4)), TNFRSF10B, (death receptor-5 (DR5)), BNIP3L.
Of note, vorinostat alone altered expression of many genes
to a similar or greater extent than the combination (Fig.
S5). Therefore, it is likely that a complex reprogramming
of gene expression drives cell death sensitivity in cells
treated with TOR-KIs plus HDACi.

experimental approach involves treating permeabilized
cells with fixed doses of death signals in the form of
peptides made from the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic
BCL-2 family proteins, and measuring mitochondrial
depolarization as in indicator of apoptosis initiation. An
increase in the ratio of pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic
factors at the mitochondria augments sensitivity to BH3
peptides and is termed mitochondrial “priming”. We
found that 16hr of treatment with MLN0128/vorinostat
significantly increased priming in four different B-ALL
cell lines (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the cell lines varied in
their response to individual drugs. These differences are
best seen in the conditions where lower concentrations
of Bim peptide (0.1 µM) or PUMA peptide (5 µM) were
added. For example, vorinostat alone increased priming
in Blin-1 and Kasumi but had little or no effect in BV173 or SUP-B15 (Fig. 6). This variability, together with
the PCR array data, suggests that the death mechanism
triggered in B-ALL cells by MLN0128/vorinostat is
complex and varies among cell lines. The identity of the
pro-apoptotic genes upregulated by each inhibitor may
vary depending on the particular epigenome and kinome

Combining TOR-KIs and HDACi increases
mitochondrial priming for death
Due to the complex changes in gene transcription,
we wanted to obtain a more direct understanding of how
the drug combinations affect overall survival signaling
at the mitochondria by using a BH3 profiling assay. The

Figure 6: BH3 profiling assay shows increased mitochondrial priming in B-ALL cells treated with MLN0128/vorinostat.
Two Ph+ (SUP-B15 and BV173) and two non-Ph (BLIN-1 and Kasumi-2) B-ALL cell lines were subjected to BH3 profiling assay 16hr

depolarization is a quantitative measure of mitochondrial apoptosis initiation. In all lines, the combination increases the cells, sensitivity
to pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides more than either agent alone. Percent depolarization of cells by each peptide is graphed. (mean +/- SD). n =

of the cells. Regardless, in all cases the combination
produced the greatest overall increase in priming, which
correspondingly accounts for some of the synergy we
observed in B-ALL cell killing.

[8]. mTORC1 also controls transcription of metabolic
genes to maintain cancer cell survival and proliferation
[54]. The precise mechanism of synergy between TORKIs and HDACi might differ among B-ALL cell lines,
depending on varying histone acetylation patterns. In
support of this, the BH3 profiling assay showed that single
agent treatment with MLN0128 or vorinostat had variable
effects on mitochondrial priming among four cell lines
tested. Previous reports of synergistic anti-cancer effects
of HDACi with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors have
identified distinct mechanisms of tumor cell killing among
different blood cancers [32, 55-58], further supporting
the idea that the mechanisms of synergy are contextdependent.
Although vorinostat is an FDA-approved treatment
for cutaneous T cell lymphoma, evidence is accumulating
that drugs of this class have a limited therapeutic window
especially in combination regimens. A clinical trial of
panobinostat with everolimus in relapsed/refractory
lymphoma resulted in some objective responses but a high
rate of adverse events including thrombocytopenia [34]. A
clinical trial of panobinostat monotherapy in Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma patients who relapse after transplant reported
some efficacy but considerable hematotoxicity [59].
Our data show that the combination of MLN0128 plus
vorinostat strongly reduces viability of B-ALL cells but
also affects normal B-lymphocytes from humans and
mice. Broad changes in the translational landscape may
be a double-edged sword that increases B-ALL killing but
also increases normal cell toxicity or suppresses cellular
function. For example, vorinostat suppresses cellular
immune responses mediated by human NK cells and T
lymphocytes [60]. Refinements in drug selectivity might
improve further the selectivity for leukemia cells. Agents
targeting a single HDAC isoform or subgroup might
maintain synergy with TOR-KIs in leukemia cells while
preserving normal physiological cell functions. Overall
our results show that the combination of TOR-KIs and
HDACi can be a viable treatment for B-ALL, but the
resulting broad changes in the transcriptional landscape
may call for the use of more isoform-selective HDAC
inhibitors to limit toxicity.

DISCUSSION
Inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hold
promise for treating cancer, and may be most effective
when used in combination with other agents [25]. For
example, rapalogs have demonstrated limited single agent
activity in human cancer patients but provide significant
clinical benefit in hormone-dependent breast cancer when
given in combination with aromatase inhibitors [24]. We
showed previously that combining TOR-KIs with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors is effective in preclinical models of Ph+
B-ALL [27, 28]. Here we report that cytotoxic potential
of TOR-KIs in B-ALL can be augmented by pan-HDAC
inhibitors such as vorinostat or panobinostat. The
synergistic effect is observed in Ph+ and non-Ph B-ALL
cell lines as well as primary pediatric B-ALL.
Our data suggest that FOXO transcription factors
may play a role in the death mechanism. FOXO proteins
help to maintain quiescence in CML stem cells [51] and
can promote apoptosis in CML cells treated with ABL
tyrosine kinase inhibitors [52, 53]. TOR-KI treatment
causes nuclear localization of FOXO proteins in B-ALL
cells, shown here in SUP-B15 cells and previously in
mouse p190 cells [27]. Moreover, we found that inducible
expression of AKT-independent, constitutively active
FOXO variants (FOXO1-A3, FOXO3a-A3) caused some
cell death in SUP-B15 cells that was further increased by
vorinostat, in the absence of TOR-KI treatment.
A plausible model is that HDACi treatment induces
epigenetic changes that facilitate access of FOXO
transcription factors to pro-apoptotic target genes in
B-ALL cells. Results from the PCR array suggested broad
reprogramming of gene expression by vorinostat alone or
in combination with MLN0128. These changes result in
B-ALL killing through activation of caspase-dependent
apoptosis. The transient elevation of both caspase-8 and
caspase-3 activity suggests that an extrinsic death pathway
is involved. However, TRAIL was not required for
B-ALL cell death in response to the MLN0128/vorinostat
combination (data not shown). It is possible that multiple
death receptors and ligands contribute to apoptosis.
The synergistic effect of TOR-KIs plus HDACi
is greater than achieved using rapamycin plus HDACi.
TOR-KIs are more effective inhibitors of mTORC2 but
also suppress phosphorylation of rapamycin-resistant
mTORC1 substrates, such as 4EBP1 [15, 22]. Hence,
it is likely that the AKT-FOXO axis downstream of
mTORC2 is not the only relevant target of TOR-KIs for
achieving synergy with HDACi. By phosphorylating
4EBP1, mTORC1 promotes cap-dependent translation
of mRNAs encoding pro-survival proteins (e.g. MCL-1)

MLN0128 and PP242 from these vendors had comparable
activity as compounds provided under a Material Transfer
Agreement by Intellikine (synthesized as previously
described [28]). Vorinostat was purchased from LC
2095

Oncotarget

laboratories, and panobinostat from Selleck. Antibodies
and flow cytometry reagents were obtained from Cell
Signaling, Invitrogen, eBioscience and Biolegend. TRAIL
R2/DR5 agonist or soluble TRAIL antagonist antibodies
were purchased from Enzo Life Science or R&D Systems.

mL (RPMI1640 supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1%
Pen/Strep, 0.5% HEPES, 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol,
10% FBS, 60 ng/mL BAFF and 20 ng/nL IL-4) in 96 well
plates at 100 µL final volume per condition. Cells were
treated with MLN0128 and/or vorinostat for 48 hours
and stained with B220-AlexaFluor488 (eBioscience),
mouse TruStain FcX (Biolegend) and 7-AAD. Lymph
nodes were harvested from C57BL/6 mice and plated at
2 million per mL in media supplemented with 10 ng/mL
IL-7 and 10 ng/mL IL-15 in 48 well plate at 300 µL final
volume per condition. Cells were treated with MLN0128
and/or vorinostat for 48 hours and stained with CD8-PE
(eBioscience), CD4-FITC (eBioscience), mouse TruStain
FcX (Biolegend) and 7-AAD.

Cell Lines
Generation and propagation of pre-B p190 mouse
cells have been previously described [27]. Nalm6 and Blin-1 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr.
David Rawlings (University of Washington), and the
RS11;4, SEM, and 697 cell lines by Dr. Anthony Letai
(Harvard Med. School). The Ph+ cell lines SUP-B15,
Tom-1, BV-173 and non-Ph lines REH and Kasumi-2
were purchased from ATCC and DSMZ. Except for the
p190 cells, all described cells represent human pre-B
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). All cells
were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2, and RPMI1640
supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% Pen/Strep, 0.5%
HEPES, 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 10% FBS.

Primary leukemia samples and stromal cocultures
We obtained bone marrow from newly diagnosed
pediatric B-ALL patients at CHOC Children’s Hospital
under Institutional Review Board protocols approved
by CHOC and by UC Irvine. Leukocytes were isolated
from these pediatric specimens by centrifugation over
Ficoll and stored frozen in aliquots. For stromal coculture experiments, hTERT-immortalized human marrow
stromal cell (MSC) (104) (provided by D. Campana, St.
Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital) were plated in 96
well plates in RPMI1640+10% FBS containing 1 µM
hydrocortisone (Sigma). The following day, the media
was replaced, and 105 B-ALL cells were plated with
hTERT-MSCs in AIM-V media (Life Technologies) with
10% FBS supplemented with human SCF, IL-3, IL-7, and
FLT-3L (Peprotech) at 100 ng/ml. The co-cultures were
immediately treated with indicated inhibitors/drugs. Fortyeight hrs post-treatment, cells were manually dislodged,
stained with human CD19-FITC (Biolegend) and 7-AAD
(Life Technologies) and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry.

Mice
Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice were kept in specific
pathogen-free animal facilities at the University of
California, Irvine, and procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We used
3-5 week old male and female Balb/c mice to obtain bone
marrow for generation of p190 cell lines. 6-12 week old
C57Bl/6 mice were used to isolate B and T cells from
spleen and lymph node.

Flow cytometry (FACS)
Surface phenotyping was performed and analyzed
with methods previously described [27]. Data was
acquired using FACSCaliber (Becton Dickinson) and
analyzed with FlowJo software version 9.5.2.

Western Blot and Nuclear Fractionation

Normal mouse and human lymphocytes

Western blot and nuclear fractionations were
performed as previously described [27, 61]. Except
for anti-Actin (Sigma), all indicated antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling.

Deidentified peripheral blood samples were obtained
from normal donors. PBMCs were purified using a Ficoll
gradient and 0.5 million cells per condition were treated
with MLN0128 and/or vorinostat in 1 mL of media
(RPMI1640 supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% Pen/
Strep, 0.5% HEPES, 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 10%
FBS). After 48 hours of treatment, cells were stained with
hCD19-PE (Biolegend), hCD4-FITC (BD Bioscience),
human TruStain FcX (Biolegend) and 7-AAD. Mouse
splenic B cells were purified using EasySep Mouse B
Cell Isolation Kit (Stem Cell Techology) from wildtype C57BL/6 mice. Cells were plated at 1 million per
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL
method (Invitrogen). To quantify transcript levels, equal
amounts of cDNA were synthesized using the iScript
cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and mixed with the SYBR
Advantage qPCR Premix (Clontech) and run on the
iCycler iQ™ Real-Time PCR Detection system (BioRad).

Oncotarget

All primers for identified genes were designed using the
open access PrimerBank software (pga.mgh.harvard.
edu/primerbank). All samples were done in duplicate or
triplicate. The 2-∆∆Ct was used to determine fold change in
mRNA levels relative to vehicle control samples (DMSO).
L32 was amplified as the internal control. The Apoptotic
PCR Array (Qiagen) was performed as per manufacturers
instructions.

and were ~80% confluent at time of transfection. Next 2.5
µg of the FOXO A3 ER or empty vector construct and 2.5
µg of pCL Ampho packaging vector were combined with
XtremeGene HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche) before
adding dropwise to 293T cells. The cells were incubated
at 37°C and the medium replaced at 24 hrs. At 48 hrs,
viral supernatant was collected and centrifuged to remove
any 293T cells in suspension. For spinfection, SUP-B15
cells in log phase of growth were resuspended in the viral
supernatant and 10 µg/mL of polybrene. The cells were
centrifuged in a 6 well plate at 500 x g and 37°C for 2
hrs and incubated at 37ºC overnight. Viral supernatant
was then replaced with regular growth medium and
the cells rested for a day. The spinfection protocol was
repeated a total of 3 times. Infected SUP-B15 cells were
resuspended in MACS Buffer (PBS, 2mM EDTA, 0.5%
BSA) and labeled with anti-hCD4 biotin antibody (1.0
µg/1 x 106 cells; eBioscience) for 10 mins at 4oC. Labeled
cells were pelleted, resuspended in MACS Buffer, and
conjugated with anti-biotin microbeads (10 µL/1 x 107
cells; Miltenyi). The cell suspension was loaded into a
MS MACS separation column (Miltenyi Biotec) to purify
only CD4+ SUP-B15 cells. To induce expression, purified
SUP-B15 cells were plated at 4 x 105 cells in 2 mL in a
12 well plate and treated with DMSO control, 200 nM
4-OHT, 500 nM Vorinostat, or 4-OHT+Vorinostat. After
48 hours, cells were labeled with anti-hCD4 Alexa 647
antibody (Biolegend) and 7-AAD. 7-AAD/FSC analysis
was performed on hCD4+ cells using the BD FACSCaliber
to detect cell viability.

Cell Cycle and Cell Death
Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously
described [27]. Briefly, cell cultures were washed with
cell cycle buffer (PBS containing 5 mM EDTA) and
subsequently fixed with ice-cold 70% EtOH dropwise
while being vortexed (medium setting). Cells were fixed
overnight at –20ºC. Samples were subsequently washed
with cell cycle buffer and incubated with 2 mg ml–1
RNase A solution for 3 hr at RT. Cells were then stained
with prodium iodide (0.5 mg/ml) for 1 hr at RT. The DNA
fluorescence parameter (585/42 nm bandpass) using linear
amplification was collected on a FACS Caliber equipped
with a 488 nm laser line. Doublets and aggregates were
excluded by pulse width versus area.
Cell death was analyzed for all indentified B-ALL
cell lines and primary patient samples using 7-AAD/
forward scatter (FSC) FACS analysis as previously
described [62]. Gating of vehicle control samples (DMSO)
was used to identify viable vs. non-viable cells. The results
of 7-AAD/FSC analysis corresponded with PI/AnnexinV-FITC (Biolegend) when tested (data not shown). As
previously shown by others, immunoblot analysis of
cleaved caspase -9 or -3 in parental B-ALL cell lines
such as SUP-B15, Nalm-6, REH-1, etc. is unreliable
in detecting death by apoptosis [43, 44]. Therefore, we
used the specific and highly sensitive [63-65] Luciferase
Caspase-Glo® -8 or -3/7 Assay Systems (Promega) to
determine kinetic caspase-3/7 or -8 activation as per the
manufacturers instructions. For caspase inhibitor studies,
the pan-capsase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH (R&D Systems)
was incubated at concentrations identified in the figure
legend concomitantly with inhibitor/drug treatment and
cell viability via 7-AAD/FSC was analyzed 48 hrs posttreatment.

BH3 Profiling
B-ALL cell lines were incubated with no inhibitor,
100 nM MLN0128, 500 nM of vorinostat, or the
combination for 16 hours. BH3 profiling was performed
as described in Vo et al [66]. Briefly, cells were washed in
PBS and resuspended at 2 x106 per mL of (TEB) Trehalose
Experimental Buffer (300 mM trehalose, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM EGTA, 5 mM succinic acid, 0.1% BSA-IgG free,
10 mM HEPES, 80 mM KCl). Next 100 µL of cells was
combined with 100 µL of TEB containing BH3 peptides
(Bim or Puma), 20 ug/mL oligomycin, 0.005% digitonin.
Then 25 µL of JC-1 (900 nM stock) was added. These
components were incubated at room temperature for 90
minutes and red JC-1 (FL2 channel) aggregates were
detected in each cell by FACS analysis immediately after.

Inducible FOXO expression
Triple alanine mutants of FOXO1 and FOXO3A
(FOXO1-A3, FOXO3A-A3) fused to the hormonebinding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) were the
gift of Dr. Boudewijn Burgering (University of Utrecht).
The cDNAs were subcloned into the retroviral vector
MSCV-IRES-hCD4 to drive bicistronic expression of the
FOXO protein and a truncated human CD4 lacking the
cytoplasmic tail. 293T cells were plated in IMDM medium
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Two-way ANOVA was used with Tukey-Kramer
post-hoc analysis for cell viability experiments. For BH3
profiling, a paired t-test was done to compare untreated
versus each treatment group for each peptide to show how
each treatment affects basal priming. We used GraphPad
2097

Oncotarget

Prism (5.0c) software for all statistical analysis. To
determine whether inhibitor combinations were additive,
synergistic, or antagonistic, we used the Chou and Talalay
median effects analysis to calculate a combination index
(CI) using CalcuSyn v1 software (Biosoft) as described
[67].
