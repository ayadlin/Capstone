ABSTRACT
Conventional cytotoxic therapies for synovial sarcoma provide limited benefit.
Drugs specifically targeting the product of its driver translocation are currently
unavailable, in part because the SS18-SSX oncoprotein functions via aberrant
interactions within multiprotein complexes. Proximity ligation assay is a recentlydeveloped method that assesses protein-protein interactions in situ. Here we report
use of the proximity ligation assay to confirm the oncogenic association of SS18-SSX
with its co-factor TLE1 in multiple human synovial sarcoma cell lines and in surgicallyexcised human tumor tissue. SS18-SSX/TLE1 interactions are disrupted by class I
HDAC inhibitors and novel small molecule inhibitors. This assay can be applied in a
high-throughput format for drug discovery in fusion-oncoprotein associated cancers
where key effector partners are known.

Polycomb recruitment by TLE1 and the fusion
oncoprotein triggers the repression of genes targeted by the
SS18-SSX/ATF2/SWI-SNF core through trimethylation
of histone H3 at lysine 27 [5]. We have previously shown
that the association of TLE1 with the SSX domain of the
fusion oncoprotein results in the repression of ATF2 target
genes, including early growth response-1 (EGR1), a key
positive regulator of the PTEN tumor suppressor [5, 7].
This permits up-regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling,
resulting in a proliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype [8].
When this association is disrupted by specific knockdown
of TLE1, ATF2 or SS18-SSX, synovial sarcoma cell lines
are observed to undergo apoptosis, indicating this complex
association is important for tumor cell survival [5].
The SS18-SSX/TLE1/ATF2 protein complex has
been shown to be disrupted following treatment with
HDAC inhibitors [5], providing an explanation for the
sensitivity of synovial sarcoma cells to HDAC inhibition
[9]. Based on the finding that the SS18-SSX fusion
oncoprotein is unique to synovial sarcoma and is necessary
and sufficient for tumor initiation [10], small molecules
able to disrupt the SS18-SSX protein complex may have
selective anti-tumor activity in synovial sarcoma. As SSX
is not expressed in somatic tissues, an attractive drug target
in this system is the SSX/TLE1 interface.

INTRODUCTION
The chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2)
is the main cytogenetic event in synovial sarcoma and
results in the fusion of the BAF complex member SS18
with one of three highly homologous transcriptional
repressor genes, SSX1, SSX2 or SSX4 [1, 2]. The resulting
SS18-SSX fusion oncogene can be detected in nearly all
synovial sarcomas and is used clinically to confirm the
diagnosis. Importantly, the expression of SS18-SSX is
necessary and sufficient for the development of synovial
sarcoma, as demonstrated in transgenic mice wherein the
conditional expression of SS18-SSX in early myoblasts
leads to tumor development without the requirement of
any cooperative transgenic changes [3].
The SS18-SSX fusion protein has been proposed
to displace native SS18, leading to aberrant SWI/SNFmediated gene transcription [4]. The fusion of SSX
to SS18 also recruits interacting proteins involved in
epigenetic regulation, including transducin-like enhancer
of split 1 (TLE1), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2),
members of the polycomb group and histone deacetylases
(HDAC) [5, 6]. Together, this is thought to bring about
the abnormal transcriptional pattern that drives malignant
transformation in synovial sarcoma [4, 5].

In the present investigation, a proximity ligation
assay (PLA) was used to screen for drugs that disrupt the
interaction between SS18-SSX and TLE1. The method
was developed to visualize protein associations and
modifications in situ with very high specificity, at interaction
distances within 30 nm (Olink Bioscience) [11, 12]. This
assay methodology allows for the direct identification
of proteins in such close proximity by utilizing proteinspecific antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotides
that are ligated and amplified using fluorophore-labelled
primer sequences [13]. The resulting fluorescent signal
can be detected by fluorescent microscopy. PLA has been
used to detect protein complexes and post-translational
modifications in situ, as well as for high-throughput
screening practices, demonstrating potential for use in preclinical drug screening models [14-17]. PLA technology
has further been used in excised tissues from in vivo studies
to monitor disease state and therapy responses [18-20].
In this study, we apply the proximity ligation assay
to show that the interaction of SS18-SSX with TLE1 is
detectable only in synovial sarcoma, confirm that this
interaction is disrupted by HDAC inhibitors, and identify
novel molecules capable of disrupting this interaction
using high-throughput drug screens. This work instantiates
the value of the proximity ligation technique in uncovering
compounds that disrupt oncogenic protein associations,

applicable to important oncogenic mechanisms among the
growing collection of neoplasms driven by translocationassociated fusion oncoproteins.

RESULTS
The proximity ligation assay detects SS18-SSX/
TLE1 co-localization in situ
In order to visualize SS18-SSX/TLE1 colocalization in synovial sarcoma in situ, we set-up
a proximity ligation assay (PLA) using antibodies
specifically recognizing SS18 and TLE1. Nuclear
proximity ligation signal is detectable between SS18 and
TLE1 in all six tested synovial sarcoma patient derived
cell lines: SYO-1 (SS18-SSX2), FUJI (SS18-SSX2), MoJo
(SS18-SSX1) (Figure 1A); Yamato-SS (SS18-SSX1), and
ASKA-SS (SS18-SSX1) (Supplementary Figure 1C); and
CME-1 (SS18-SSX2) (Figure 2B). Weak or non-specific
PLA signals are detectable in cells lines of other cancer
subtypes (including three sarcomas bearing different
fusion oncoproteins): MCF7 (breast carcinoma), HeLa
(cervical carcinoma), A673 (Ewing sarcoma, EWS-FLI1)
(Figure 1A), 402-91 (myxoid liposarcoma, FUS-DDIT3),
SU-CCS-1 (clear cell sarcoma, EWS-ATF1), as well as

Figure 1: The proximity ligation assay demonstrates SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization selectively in synovial sarcoma
cell lines. SS18-SSX positive cell lines (SYO-1, FUJI, MoJo) demonstrate SS18-SSX/TLE1 proximity by visualization of fluorescent

nuclear foci while control cell lines (MCF7, HeLa, A673) showed little nuclear staining A. The intensity of the nuclear signal was
quantified  and shown to be significantly greater  in SS18-SSX confirmed-positive cell lines B. The SS18-SSX/TLE1 protein-protein
interaction was confirmed to be specific for synovial sarcoma cell lines by co-immunoprecipitation C. Scale bars represent 20 μm. Error

single antibody, no antibody, and non-specific antibody
conditions (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Quantification of SS18/TLE1 PLA signals in
synovial sarcoma cell line nuclei is more than 10-fold
higher than the level seen in control cell lines (Figures 1B
and Supplementary Figure 1D). Co-immunoprecipitation
analyses further demonstrate that the interaction of SS18SSX with TLE1 is specific to synovial sarcoma, as SS18SSX is pulled down with TLE1 exclusively in synovial
sarcoma cell lines (Figure 1C). All cell lines used in this
study express some level of SS18 and of TLE1; the lack
of SS18 and TLE1 co-localization in SS18-SSX negative
cell lines therefore indicates the nuclear proximity ligation
signal is a result of the SS18-SSX/TLE1 interaction
and not of wild-type SS18/TLE1 protein interactions
(Supplementary Figure 1B).

with TLE1 is lost and quantification of foci per nucleus
is significantly decreased (Figure 2C, 2F). Both siRNA
systems target SSX mRNA regions of the fusion transcript,
and result in the specific silencing of SS18-SSX but not
of endogenous SS18, bringing about a loss of SS18-SSX/
TLE1 proximity ligation signals. This verifies previous
results [5] which demonstrated that the interaction of SS18
with TLE1 occurs only in the context of the SS18-SSX
fusion oncoprotein.

Proximity ligation signals can be detected in
FFPE synovial sarcoma tumor tissue samples
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) patientderived synovial sarcoma tumor samples were used to
detect SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization in human tumor
tissue samples. Immunohistochemical staining in synovial
sarcoma patient surgical specimens demonstrated the
presence of SS18-SSX and TLE1 as well as the specificity
of TLE1 for synovial sarcoma cells (Figure 3A, 3B).
In an excised pulmonary metastasis, SS18-SSX/TLE1
complex co-localization signal is detected exclusively
in synovial sarcoma tissue nuclei (Figure 3C, 3D) while
the adjacent normal lung tissues are negative (Figure 3E).
The specificity of the proximity ligation signal in FFPE
samples was additionally validated in embedded synovial
sarcoma cell pellets in comparison to control sarcoma

TLE1 co-localizes with SS18 only in the context
of SS18-SSX
Reliable antibodies to detect SSX, suitable for co-IP
or PLA assays, are currently not available. To determine
whether SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization is specific
for the fusion oncoprotein, knockdown of SS18-SSX
was achieved with siRNA molecules (Figure 2A-2C)
as well as shRNA vectors (Figure 2D-2F). When SS18SSX expression is silenced, co-localization of SS18-SSX

Figure 2: Knockdown of SS18-SSX results in a loss of SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization and a significant decrease
in PLA nuclear signals. 50 pmol of siRNA was used to knockdown SS18-SSX in SYO-1 cells, as demonstrated by a loss of protein

expression. Protein levels A. and PLA signals B, C. were analyzed 48 hours post siRNA treatment. CME-1 cells were stably transfected
with a doxycycline-inducible shRNA against SS18-SSX. Protein level D. and PLA signals E, F. were assessed at 24 hours post 4 μg/μL
doxycycline (DX) treatment. Scale bars represent 20 μm. Statistical significance compared to RNA interference controls was determined by
Student t test: * denotes p < 0.05; ** denotes p < 0.01. Error bars represent standard error of mean from three images.

cell lines bearing different translocations (Supplementary
Figure 2). SS18-SSX/TLE1 proximity ligation signal was
detected only in synovial sarcoma samples.

Class I HDAC inhibitor-induced dissociation of
SS18-SSX/TLE1 interactions is visualized as a significant
decrease in PLA nuclear signal as well as a loss of SS18SSX pulled down with TLE1 (Figure 4C). HDAC6
inhibition had minimal effect on SS18-SSX/TLE1 colocalization (Figure 4A-4C), supporting class I HDAC
inhibition as being required for disruption of this complex.
Dissociation of the SS18-SSX/TLE1 complex following
HDAC inhibition correlates with apoptotic induction in
synovial sarcoma cell lines (Figure 4D). The addition of
proteasome inhibitor MG-132 does not prevent complex
disruption, demonstrating that the observed dissociation of
the SS18-SSX/TLE1 complex induced by class I HDAC
inhibitors is not due to protein degradation (Supplementary
Figure 3A-3B).
To demonstrate specificity of this drug-mediated
protein complex dissociation, a panel of drug classes was
tested concurrently in a 96-well high-throughput format,
and the relative signal intensity of SS18-SSX/TLE1 colocalization was quantified (Figure 4E). SYO-1 cells were
exposed to IC50 doses of the HDAC inhibitors FK228,
MS-275, SAHA, SB939, ITF2357 (givinostat), JNJ26481585 (quisinostat), LAQ824 (dacinostat), PCI-24781
(abexinostat), as well as doxorubicin (DNA intercalator)

PLA enables in situ visualization of HDAC
inhibitor-induced dissociation of SS18-SSX from
TLE1
Previous studies have demonstrated that HDAC
inhibitors disrupt the fusion oncoprotein complex in
synovial sarcoma, re-establishing expression of tumor
suppressor genes and apoptotic response [5, 7, 8]. To
investigate if the SS18-SSX/TLE1 complex disruption
induced by HDAC inhibitors can be detected in situ
using the PLA method, SYO-1 synovial sarcoma cells
were treated at IC50 doses with the class I HDAC
inhibitors FK288 (romidepsin), MS275 (entinostat),
SAHA (vorinostat) or the pan-HDAC inhibitor SB939
(pracinostat), as well as nexturastat A (a cytoplasmic
class IIb HDAC6 inhibitor). SS18-SSX/TLE1 complex
assembly following HDAC inhibition was assessed by
proximity ligation signal in five synovial sarcoma cell lines
(Figures 4A-4B and Supplementary Figure 3A-3F) and
was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 4C).

Figure 3: The PLA assay can be used to detect SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization in FFPE human synovial sarcoma
tumor samples. IHC staining of SS18 A. and TLE1 B. is strongly positive in synovial sarcoma tumor tissue from the metastasectomy
specimen. The PLA nuclear signal is detected in the fixed human synovial sarcoma tumor tissue C, D. but not in the immediately adjacent
normal lung tissue C, E. Scale bars represent 100 μm.

and PI-103 (PI3K inhibitor). Only class I HDAC inhibitors
consistently disrupt SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization
and decrease cell viability. By comparison, drugs
primarily acting via DNA intercalation or PI3K inhibition
significantly decrease cell viability without concomitant
effects on the relative co-localization signal staining
intensity of the fusion oncoprotein with its partner.

hits from the viability assessment had different degrees of
concurrent effect on the protein co-localization measures
(Figure 5A). The top three available compounds capable of
disrupting the SS18-SSX/TLE1 proximity ligation signal
were validated in multiple synovial sarcoma cell lines. One
compound (designated SXT1596) demonstrated particular
efficacy in decreasing cell viability selectively in synovial
sarcoma cell lines (Figure 5B-5C). Compound SXT1596
effectively disrupts the interaction between SS18-SSX
and TLE1, as confirmed by PLA and immunoprecipitation
(Figure 5D-5F).

PLA detection of oncoprotein interactions can be
used in high-throughput drug screens to identify
molecules that disrupt the SS18-SSX oncoprotein

Novel compound SXT1596 re-establishes normal
cell signalling in synovial sarcoma

A high-throughput drug screen consisting of 16 000
small molecule inhibitors (Maybridge Chemicals) was
completed in synovial sarcoma cell lines expressing the
SS18-SSX oncoprotein. Compounds eliciting a decrease
in cell viability of greater than 50% were assessed for
disruptions to SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization in a highthroughput 96-well PLA format. At IC50 doses, the top 20

Treatment of SYO-1 cells with SXT1596 resulted
in significantly decreased cell viability (Figure 6A) and
increased apoptosis (Figure 6B) that correlated with
the decrease in SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization signal
(Figure 6C-6D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed

Figure 4: HDAC inhibitors disrupt SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization. A significant decrease in detectable PLA signal following

HDAC inhibition in SYO-1 cells A, B. is also confirmed by immunoprecipitation C. The decrease in PLA co-localization signal correlates
with apoptosis induction by HDAC inhibitor FK228 in SYO-1 cells D. A panel of cytotoxic compounds and HDAC1/3 inhibitors were
screened on SYO-1 cell at IC50 doses for 12 hours. While all compounds were effective in decreasing cell viability, only compounds
inhibiting class I HDACs were found to decrease the PLA nuclear signal, as a result of disrupting SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization E. Scale

a decrease in HDAC1 and H3K23me3 at the EGR1
promoter, a known target for repression by the SS18SSX/TLE1/ATF2 complex consistent with a disruption
of the biologic effects on SS18-SSX target genes in
synovial sarcoma (Figure 6E) [5, 7, 8]. Similar to class
I HDAC inhibitors, the compound SXT1596 reactivates
EGR1 transcription and protein expression (Figure 6F6G). SS18-SSX protein levels remain relatively constant
following SXT1596 treatment, whereas the FK228 HDAC
inhibitor leads to oncoprotein degradation (Figure 6G).

and can be used in high-throughput drug screens. As
t(X;18) is the sole driving cytogenic event in synovial
sarcoma, inhibiting the interactions of the resulting SS18SSX chimeric oncoprotein with its effector partners can
prevent aberrant transcriptional repression, potentially
reverse oncogenic effects and initiate apoptosis. PLA
allows for quantification of the loss of protein interactions,
which can be used to assess drug action and select the
most potent agents in this model.
In a high-throughput PLA format, inhibitors
capable of disrupting the driving complex can be
revealed quickly, in situ. This is an efficient means to
screen large compound libraries for their capacity to
disrupt the relevant oncogenic interactions. In addition,
in contrast to fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) methodology in which fluorescent probes
must be engineered onto proteins of interest [21], PLA
requires no synthetic protein modifications (that may
obstruct normal protein complex interactions). Physical

DISCUSSION
In this study, the proximity ligation assay was
applied to a neoplasm driven by a fusion oncoprotein, in
this case confirming the key SS18-SSX interaction with
TLE1 in synovial sarcoma cells and patient samples. This
method can assess the capacity for drugs to disrupt the
relevant functional interactions of a mutant oncoprotein,

Figure 5: The PLA assay can be used for high-throughput drug screening for targeted compounds in synovial sarcoma.

From a 16 000 compound small molecule drug library, a compound designated SXT1596 was recognized to significantly decrease relative
co-localization of SS18-SSX/TLE1 in human synovial sarcoma cells A. SXT1596 selectively decreases cell viability in synovial sarcoma
cell lines, SYO-1, FUJI, Yamato-SS, HS-SY-II, YaFuss and MoJo (white bars), when compared to negative control cell lines HEK293T,
MCF7, HeLa and A673 (shaded bars) at a concentration of 5 μM B. Negative control cell lines HeLa and A673 are sensitive to SXT1596
at higher doses. SXT1596 (5-(2-Nitro-1-propenyl)-1,3-benzodioxole) (structure shown in C.) mediated disruption of the SS18-SSX/TLE1
association was confirmed by immunoprecipitation D. Nuclear SS18-SSX/TLE1 PLA signal in SYO-1 cells decreased following SXT1596
treatment to a degree similar to that obtained with the HDAC inhibitor FK228 E, F. Statistical significance compared to vehicle treatment
controls was determined by Student t test: * denotes p < 0.05. Error bars represent standard error of mean from conditions performed in
triplicate. Small molecule C. was drawn using iChem Labs ChemDoodle software. Scale bars represent 20 μm.

interactions among proteins are time and cell context
dependent, and the detection of a particular proteinprotein interaction in a generic experimental condition
or in cell culture models may not accurately represent the
situation in patients.
PLA is performed in the context of the cell’s
naturally occurring biology, reducing the likelihood of
artifactual alterations to SS18-SSX interactions (which are
likely to occur, for example, when SS18-SSX is forcibly
overexpressed in vector-based systems as opposed to being
expressed under its endogenous promoter at physiological
levels in its original cellular background). This methodology
therefore anticipates a streamlined approach to screen for
effective therapeutics targeting the driving complex in
synovial sarcoma, and will be similarly applicable in other
cancers driven by fusion transcription factors. These include
other sarcomas and hematopoietic neoplasms typically

afflicting young patients, as well as an increasing number of
other tumors wherein recurrent fusions are being identified
by RNA-Seq technologies [22].
The compound designated SXT1596 (5-(2-Nitro1-propenyl)-1,3-benzodioxole) identified in the PLA
drug screen to decrease SS18-SSX/TLE1 co-localization
is a biologically active chemical. A number of similar
1,3-benzodioxole derivatives have demonstrated antitumor activity by various mechanisms, including binding
to tubulin and heat-shock protein inhibition [23-25]. In
addition, the trans-β-Nitrostyrene domain possessed by
SXT1596 has been observed in related compounds to
inhibit protein phosphatases [26] and telomerase [27],
resulting in anti-tumor action in several cancer subtypes
[28-30]. Whether the compound directly inhibits the SS18SSX/TLE1 interaction domain or disrupts the complex by
a secondary mechanism is currently unknown, but the

Figure 6: SXT1596 decreases cell viability and reactivates EGR1 expression in synovial sarcoma. The small molecule
SXT1596 induces apoptosis at a similar rate to that of HDAC inhibitor FK228 in SYO-1 cells A, B. and brings about a consistent decrease
in SS18-SSX/TLE1 PLA co-localization signal in SYO-1 cells C. The induction of apoptosis correlates with the decrease in PLA colocalization signal D. Chromatin immunoprecipitation at the EGR1 promoter reveals a decrease in H3K27me3 enrichment following
SXT1596 treatment E. SXT1596 reactivates EGR1 expression, at the RNA F. and protein G. level. Error bars represent standard error of
mean from conditions performed in triplicate. Linear regression was measured by goodness of fit calculations in Prism Graphpad.

protein inhibitor, not expected to be well tolerated until
further pharmacologic optimization steps are carried
out [31].
Driving protein complexes are often recruited
and deregulated in translocation-associated sarcomas
[32]. Uncovering new methods of study and utilizing
emerging technologies such as the proximity ligation
assay may allow better means to identify therapeutic
strategies. In synovial sarcoma, this technique can be
used in a high-throughput format to screen targeting
compounds as a means of identifying novel agents with
disease-specific activity. This methodology should also
be applicable in other types of translocation-associated
cancers.

out using the Ventana automated staining platform, with
primary antibody at a 1/150 dilution for both SS18 (SantaCruz Biotechnologies, sc-28698) and TLE1 (Origene,
TA800301).

Proximity ligation assay
Cells were seeded in culture treated chamber
slides or in 96 well plates. The following day, wells
were treated with pharmacologic agents for 0, 4, 8, or
12 hours. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with
3% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100. Wells were blocked with blocking buffer and
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies at
a 1/1000 dilution: SS18 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa-Cruz
Biotechnologies, sc-28698) or TLE1 (mouse monoclonal,
Origene, TA800301). Proximity ligation was performed
utilizing the Duolink® In Situ Red Starter Kit Mouse/
Rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The oligonucleotides and antibody-nucleic
acid conjugates used were those provided in the
Sigma-Aldrich PLA kit (DUO92101). Alexa Fluor 488
secondary antibody (Life Technologies) was added
during signal amplification to confirm the presence of
nuclear proteins. Fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss
Axioplan2 microscope at 40x. Images were quantified
in triplicate using ImageJ software (NIH) as foci per
nucleus, defined as the number of interaction points
counted per nucleus. Co-localization fluorescence signal
staining intensity was detected using the automated
Cellomics ArrayScan VTI compartmentalization
analysis software (Thermo Scientific). Twenty images
per well were quantified. Relative PLA stain signal was
normalized to the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) treated control
as well as to TLE1 antibody-only control, to account for
background signal.
Proximity ligation in FFPE samples was performed
according to the manufacturer’s brightfield protocol.
Sections were heated at 60°C for one hour, then deparaffinized in Citrisolv (Fisher Scientific) and rehydrated
using an ethanol gradient. Antigen retrieval was performed
with Borg Decloaker (Biocare) in a water bath heated at
95°C for 20 minutes. The slides were cooled to room
temperature in antigen retrieval solution for 10 minutes
and in a cold water bath for an additional 10 minutes.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 2%
hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at room temperature,
and cell membranes permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes. Slides were incubated with
Dako protein block for 30 minutes at room temperature to
eliminate nonspecific protein background. The antibody
pair was diluted using Dako antibody diluent and
incubated on the slides overnight. The proximity ligation
procedure was carried out the following day. Images were
captured using an Olympus BX46 brightfield microscope
with a WHN10x-h/22 eyepiece and an Olympus DP21
camera.

with 30-50 pmol siSS18-SSX2 and 9 μL Lipofectamine
RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM serum free media (Life Technologies), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein was harvested
48 hours post transfection, and knock-down confirmed
by western blot with SS18 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies).
The synovial sarcoma CME-1 cell line was stably
transfected with a doxycycline-inducible shRNA targeting
SS18-SSX. CME-1 cells were used for these experiments
because they are more easily transfected than other
available synovial sarcoma cell lines. The inducible
line was generated with the use of a pcDNA6 TR and
subsequently with the pSuperior shRNA vector encoding
a target oligonucleotide specific for the 3’ UTR region of
SS18-SSX (1, 2 and 4), as previously described [34, 35].
shRNA-mediated knockdown of SS18-SSX was induced
by the addition of doxycycline (Clontech). Protein was
harvested 24 hours post transfection and knock-down was
confirmed by western blot with SS18 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies).

Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and treated
in triplicate at IC50 doses of the tested pharmacological
agents. IC50 doses were determined in synovial sarcoma
cell lines by dose curve studies. Cell viability was assessed
as compared with the vehicle 0.1% DMSO condition at
48 hours post treatment using MTS reagent (Promega).
Cell confluency and apoptosis induction was assessed over
a 48-hour timeframe utilizing the IncuCyte Zoom® live
cell imaging software (Essen BioScience). Apoptosis was
assessed by IncuCyte™ Kinetic Caspase-3/7 Apoptosis
Assay Reagent (Essen BioScience, 4440).

Co-immunoprecipitation and western blots
According to the manufacturers protocol,
6  μg of antibody (TLE1: Abcam, ab125183; normal
rabbit IgG: Santa-Cruz Biotechnologies, sc-2027) in
PBST was added to 50 μL of Dynabeads® Protein G
magnetic beads (Life Technologies) for 30 minutes
with rotation at room temperature. Antibody was then
crosslinked to the beads with the addition of 5 mM
BS3 (ThermoScientific, 21580) in conjugation buffer
for 30 minutes with rotation at room temperature.
Crosslinking was quenched with Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for 15
minutes at room temperature. Beads were then washed
3 times with conjugation buffer and once with PBST.
Following drug treatment, cells were washed with icecold PBS and incubated with Triton X-100 (SigmaAldrich) lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, with inversion
every 10 minutes. Whole cell lysates were centrifuged
at 4°C, 10 000 rpm for 15 minutes. Supernatants were
quantified and 1000 μg of protein was mixed with the
antibody-crosslinked beads. The immunoprecipitation
was incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. The
supernatant was then removed and the beads were
washed 3 times in lysis buffer and 3 times in PBST, and
then boiled in 2X loading dye for 5 minutes.
Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Blots were incubated with indicated antibodies (TLE:
Origene TA800301; SS18: Santa Cruz Biotechnologies,
sc-28698; EGR1: Cell Signalling, 4153S; GAPDH: Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies sc-25778). Signals were visualized
using the Odyssey Infrared System (LI-COR Biosciences).

High-throughput drug screen assay
The 16 000 compound Maybridge Chemicals
library drug screen was undertaken in SYO-1 cells. Cells
were seeded in 96 well plates at 10 000 cells/well. The
following day, compounds from the Maybridge library
were transferred from stock plates (5 mM in DMSO) using
a Biorobotics Biogrid II pinning robot with a 96-pin tool
diameter of 0.4-mm, to bring about a final concentration
of approximately 5 μM per well. Plates were developed
with MTS reagent 24 hours post treatment to select for
direct effects at this dose. Hits bringing about a decrease
in viability of greater than 50% were validated in a doseresponse curve and in additional synovial sarcoma cell
lines. IC50 doses of the small molecules were used for PLA
validation studies.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP experiments were performed following the
Active Motif ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic kit protocol.
Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde prior
to lysis and homogenization. Cross-linked DNA was
sheared by enzymatic digestion. After centrifugation,
the supernatants were incubated with the indicated
antibody at 4°C overnight. Precipitates were washed,
eluted with 1% SDS and incubated at 65°C to reverse
crosslinking. ChIP-enriched DNA was purified by
phenol-chloroform (Invitrogen) and ethanol precipitation,
and was subjected to SYBR Green qPCR analysis
(Roche) using an ABI ViiA7 qPCR system and an
EGR1 promoter primer set (hEGR1 -0.1 kb/CRE
sense: TAGGGTGCAGGATGGAGGT,
antisense:
AAGCAGGAAGCCCTAATATGGCAG) [5].

RNA interference
Duplex oligo (sense, CAAGAAGCCAGCA
GAGGAATT; antisense, UUCCUCUGCUGGCUUCU
UGTT) SS18-SSX2 siRNAs were designed to target
the SSX portion of SS18-SSX using the Integrated DNA
Technologies RNA interference (RNAi) design tool, and
synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) as
previously described [7]. SYO-1 cells were seeded in 6
well plates. At 60% confluence, cells were transfected
