ABSTRACT
Although mutational inactivation of p53 is found in 50% of all human tumors,
a subset of tumors display defective p53 function, but retain wild-type (WT) p53.
Here, direct and indirect mechanisms leading to the loss of WT p53 activities are
discussed. We summarize the oncogenic roles of iASPP, an inhibitor of WT p53, in
promoting proliferation, invasion, drug or radiation-resistance and metastasis. From
the therapeutic view, we highlight promising perspectives of microRNA-124, peptide
and small molecules that reduce or block iASPP for the treatment of cancer. High
iASPP expression enhances proliferation, aggressive behavior, the resistance to
radiation/chemotherapy and correlates with poor prognosis in a range of human
tumors. Overexpression of iASPP accelerates tumorigenesis and invasion through
p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. MicroRNA-124 directly targets
iASPP and represses the growth and invasiveness of cancer cells. The disruption of
iASPP-p53 interaction by a p53-derived peptide A34 restores p53 function in cancer
cells. The inhibition of iASPP phosphorylation with small molecules induces p53dependent apoptosis and growth suppression. The mechanisms underlying aberrant
expression of iASPP in human tumors should be further investigated. Reactivating
WT p53 functions by targeting its novel inhibitor iASPP holds promise for potential
therapeutic interventions in the treatment of WT p53-containing tumors.

INTRODUCTION

epigenetic changes interact with each other to enable
cancer progression [3].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are characterized as
endogenous, small size, non-coding RNA molecules that
post-transcriptionally control the translation and stability
of mRNAs [4]. MiRNAs are predicted to regulate the
expression of approximately 60% of human genes [5]. A
single miRNA can bind to multiple mRNAs via perfect or
partial base-pairing with the 3’-untranslated region (UTR)
of the target mRNAs [5], resulting in profound effects on
gene expression and cellular functions. MiRNAs modulate
tumor cell proliferation, invasion and EMT/cancer stem
cell (CSC) properties by targeting multiple downstream

The initiation and progression of cancer is a
multistep process including self-renewal, aberrant cell
cycle, defective apoptosis, the induction of the epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhanced mobility,
invasion and angiogenesis, and the remodeling of the
tumor microenvironment [1]. In addition to numerous
genetic alterations, such as inactivation of a tumor
suppressor and activation of an oncogene, human tumor
cells harbor global epigenetic abnormalities, such as
DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome
positioning and non-coding RNAs [2]. Genetic and

genes or signaling pathways [6, 7, 8].
The p53 family members (p53, p63 and p73) play
a pivotal role in the regulation of many critical biological
processes including cell death, proliferation, cell cycle
control and tumorigenesis [9, 10, 11, 12]. When DNA
damage is sensed, the apical kinases ATM and ATR
checkpoint pathways are triggered, and in turn activates
and stabilizes wild-type (WT) p53 via the phosphorylation
of CHK2/CHK1, or degradation of MDM2 [13]. Once
activated by various cellular stresses, WT p53 accumulates
in the nucleus and works as a transcriptional factor to
either transactivate or transrepress downstream genes
or miRNAs, leading to the induction of growth arrest,
cellular senescence and apoptosis, the inhibition of
angiogenesis and metastasis in tumors [9, 14, 15, 16]
(Figure 1). In addition to these anticancer effects, a new
role of p53 has emerged, regulation of EMT and CSC
features [9, 17, 18]. During the metastatic cascade, tumor
cells usually activate the EMT, a dynamic cellular process
thought to be critical step of metastasis by promoting the
acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities and gain
of CSC-like phenotypes, such as the resistance to radiation
or chemotherapy [1]. Several transcription factors
including Snail, Slug, Twist and ZEB-1/2 induce EMT, by
downregulating the epithelial markers such as E-cadherin
and by upregulating the mesenchymal markers such as
vimentin [1]. By targeting Slug and Snail, p53 negatively
regulates EMT and suppresses cancer cell invasiveness
[19, 20]. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that WT
p53 can also indirectly silence EMT-inducing transcription
factors though the transcriptional regulation of some
miRNAs, such as miR-34, miR-130b, miR-145, miR192, miR-215 and miR-200c [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27]. For example, by binding to the promoter region of
miR-130b, p53 transactivates this miRNA to reduce the
levels of ZEB1 (a direct target gene of miR-130b), and
thereby attenuates EMT and invasiveness in endometrial
cancer cells [22]. These studies support the idea that the
disruption of p53 tumor suppressor-regulated pathways
contributes to progression and worse clinical outcome of
human tumors [28].
In this review, we provide a brief overview of
the mechanisms by which the functions of WT p53 are
inactivated and will focus on the oncogenic roles of
iASPP, a negative regulator of WT p53, in human tumors.
We will discuss current approaches that aim to restore
p53 functions by targeting iASPP, including miR-124, a
peptide derived from p53 and other small molecules.

result of mutations [29], however a subset of tumors,
such as cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloblastic
leukaemia, myeloma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, mantle
cell lymphoma and sarcoma, retains WT p53, but its
activity can be attenuated [30, 31]. MDM2 is the bestknown inhibitor of p53. MDM2 limits p53 activity by
binding to and blocking the N-terminal trans-activation
domain of p53, or by working as an E3 ubiquitin ligase
to promote p53 degradation [32, 33]. MDM2 is directly
inhibited by the tumor suppressor p14ARF, loss of which
also leads to reduced p53 [34]. MDMX, a homolog of
MDM2, can interact with p53 and repress its activities
[35]. Moreover, the EMT inducers Twist and BMI-1
were shown to mediate the inhibition of p53 pathway
via suppressing p14ARF [36, 37]. The E6 oncoproteins
of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) bind p53
and are capable of inducing its degradation [38]. Human
TP73 gene produces an NH2 terminally truncated isoform,
ΔNp73 that lacks the transactivation domain and function
as a dominant-negative inhibitor of WT p53 [39]. Other
mechanisms responsible for loss of WT p53 functions in
human tumors include the lack of p53 nuclear retention
[40] and the deacetylation of p53 by Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)
[41]. Thus, the reactivation of endogenous p53, either by
reducing or blocking its negative regulators, would benefit
cancer patients with WT p53 tumors [42].

THE ONCOGENIC ROLES OF IASPP IN
HUMAN TUMORS
To date, intensive efforts have been made to
restore WT p53 activity as an anticancer therapeutic
approach [42]. Reducing the levels of p53 suppressors or
interfering with the direct physical association between
p53 suppressors and p53, has shown effectiveness for the
restoration of p53 function. For example, Withaferin A
(WA), a small-molecule natural compound, downregulates
the expression of HPV E6 oncoprotein and helps to restore
p53-dependent apoptosis in cervical cancer cells [43].
Given that the inhibition of p53 by MDM2 protein relies
on their direct binding with p53, small-molecule MDM2
inhibitors, such as Nutlin-3 that disrupts this interaction,
have been utilized to induce WT p53-mediated cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis in various types of tumor cells [42].
However, tumor cells may develop the resistance to
Nutlin-3 owing to the fact that this MDM2 inhibitor does
not efficiently target the MDMX-p53 interaction or fails
to induce MDMX degradation [44]. More importantly, the
continuous Nutlin-3 exposure can result in the acquisition
of somatic mutations in p53 and select for p53-mutated
cells in solid tumors [45, 46]. Therefore, additional
attempts to achieve p53 activation through targeting other
p53 inhibitors are required for effective tumor regression.
The ASPP family consisting of three proteins
(ASPP1, ASPP2 and iASPP) interacts with and modulates

the functions of WT p53 [47]. ASPP1/2 enhances p53dependent cell death, whereas iASPP inhibits the apoptotic
transactivation potential of p53 by direct interaction [47].
Here, we review the oncogenic functions of iASPP in
tumors and discuss promising therapeutic perspectives of
miRNA, peptide and small molecules that reduce or block
iASPP for the treatment of cancer.
Human iASPP, which is encoded by PPP1R13L
located on 19q13.2-3 [48], has two isoforms (407 and 828
amino acids-aa) [49, 50]. The shorter form of iASPP (407
aa) is a nuclear protein, and the longer form of iASPP (828
aa) is located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm [48, 49,
50]. iASPP was considered as an oncogene that not only
inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 on promoters
of downstream genes (Figure 1a), but also promotes
carcinogenesis through p53-independent mechanisms,
mainly by inhibiting the apoptotic activity of p63 and p73
[51]. Of note, in normal cells, iASPP can actually induce
apoptosis via inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [52].
iASPP is overexpressed in diverse human tumors,
including colorectal cancer [53], acute leukemia [54],

endometrioid endometrial cancer [55], lung cancer
[56], glioblastoma [57], head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma [58], prostate cancer [59], hepatocellular
carcinoma [60, 61, 62], oral squamous cell carcinoma [63,
64], cervical cancer [65] and ovarian cancer [66]. Elevated
expression of iASPP correlates with poor survival in head
and neck cancer [58], oral squamous cell carcinoma [64],
cervical cancer [65] and ovarian cancer [66]. Increased
iASPP expression is associated with tumor grade, invasion
and lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer [55].
Furthermore, siRNA- or shRNA-mediated iASPP silencing
reduces in vitro proliferation in human cancer cells [56,
59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 67, 68, 69]. The overexpression of
iASPP in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts promotes
p53 degradation and strongly stimulates cell migration and
metastasis [70]. These data suggest that iASPP contributes
to the progression and metastasis of human tumors.
Human cancers are composed of heterogeneous cell
populations. Genetic and phenotypic variation exists not
only between different tumor types or between patients
with the same tumor type (inter-tumor heterogeneity), but

IASPP, A TARGET FOR ANTITUMOR
THERAPEUTICS

also within a single tumor (intra-tumor heterogeneity) [71].
This intra-tumor heterogeneity produces distinct subclones
that show diverse malignant properties [72.]. It is thought
that within a tumor, only a small population of tumor
cells (CSC) is capable of self-renewal, multipotency, in
vivo tumorigenicity and forming metastasis [73, 74]. This
CSC model has been used to explain tumor heterogeneity.
Accumulating evidence has linked p53 loss to stem-like
phenotypes in cancers [9]. Importantly, knockdown of
iASPP with siRNA impaired in vivo tumorigenesis of
prostate cancer cells [59]. These data support the possible
role of iASPP in promoting CSC properties, at least
though inhibiting p53 activity.
On the other hand, the concept of CSC plasticity
(the model of dynamic stemness) has been also proposed
[75], in which CSC and non-CSC states may not be
definitive, and cancer cells have the dynamic and transient
ability of shifting from a non-CSC state to a CSC state as
a consequence of EMT induction or microenvironmental
stimuli [75]. The plasticity of CSC may at least partially
help explain the tumor heterogeneity observed in tumors,
and is consistent with those findings that tumor cell
undergoing EMT can acquire stem cell-like properties [1].
Despite some results showing that the activation of
EMT program suppresses the tumor-initiating properties
of CSCs [76, 77], numerous studies have provided a strong
link between EMT activation and the emergence of a CSClike phenotype in human cancers [78]. In endometrial
cancer, oncogenes such as p53 gain-of-function mutations
[21], KLF17 [79], EZH2, MCL-1 and FOS [8] promote
EMT-associated invasiveness and enhance CSC properties
including self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance,
whereas miR-101, miR-106b, miR-130b and miR-194 [7,
8, 22, 80] serve as EMT suppressors and attenuate CSC
features. Of significance, CSC cells enriched with CD29
and CD44 markers exhibit molecular characteristics,
consistent with EMT [81]. These data collectively suggest
a close correlation between EMT induction and CSC
characteristics.
The increased iASPP expression is correlated
with the resistance to radiation or chemotherapy in
cervical cancer [65]. The overexpression of iASPP in
ovarian cancer cells confers resistance to paclitaxel
[66]. Consistent with these observations, enhanced
iASPP expression can render cells resistant to ultraviolet
radiation and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human tumors
expressing WT p53 [82]. Given the anti-oncogenic effects
of WT p53 on EMT and CSC phenotypes, we speculate
that iASPP might have a regulatory role in enhancing
EMT and CSC-related phenotypes, such as resistance
to chemotherapy and radiation, by inhibiting WT p53
function [83]. More studies are clearly needed to address
these possibilities.

The therapeutic targeting of iASPP might include
targeting iASPP itself as well as modulating its upstream
regulators or downstream effectors (Figure 1a). The Wnt/
beta-catenin signaling seems to be an upstream regulator
of iASPP in gastric cancer, because the attenuation of
beta-catenin by shRNA resulted in apparent apoptosis
and downregulated iASPP [84]. MiR-124 directly targets
iASPP and represses the growth and invasiveness in
a variety of cancer cells, including colorectal cancer,
glioblastoma and prostate cancer [85, 86, 87]. In
addition, A34 (a small peptide derived from p53 linker)
binds directly to iASPP and competitively inhibits the
iASPP-p53 interaction in human tumor cells [88], causing
WT p53-mediated transcriptional activation of Bax and
PUMA and tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo [88].
Furthermore, a small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin B/
CDK1, JNJ-7706621 that inhibits iASPP phosphorylation
and prevents the nuclear entry of iASPP, can induce
WT p53-dependent apoptosis and growth suppression
in melanoma cells [89]. The identification of miRNAs
and molecules that control the levels of iASPP and a
high-throughput screening to search for small-molecule
compounds that release p53 from iASPP, would lead to the
development of therapies against iASPP for the treatment
of human tumors through activation of WT p53.

CONCLUSIONS
In addition to affecting tumor cell proliferation and
survival, WT p53 can repress cancer initiation, progression
and metastasis by regulating downstream genes and
miRNAs-target gene networks. A more complete
understanding of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms
underlying aberrant expression of WT p53 inhibitor iASPP
in human tumors, and detailed studies on iASPP function
in various aspects of tumor progression, including EMT,
stemness and metastasis, can provide a basis for new
potential therapeutic applications in WT p53-containing
tumors.
