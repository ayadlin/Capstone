ABSTRACT
We have previously demonstrated that estrogen receptor (ER) alpha (ESR1)
increases proliferation of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) through both an estrogendependent and -independent (induced by IGF-II/IGF1R pathways) manner. Then, the
use of tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), appears effective
in reducing ACC growth in vitro and in vivo. However, tamoxifen not only exerts
antiestrogenic activity, but also acts as full agonist on the G protein-coupled estrogen
receptor (GPER). Aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a non-steroidal
GPER agonist G-1 in modulating ACC cell growth. We found that G-1 is able to exert
a growth inhibitory effect on H295R cells both in vitro and, as xenograft model,
in vivo. Treatment of H295R cells with G-1 induced cell cycle arrest, DNA damage
and cell death by the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic mechanism. These events
required sustained extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation. Silencing
of GPER by a specific shRNA partially reversed G-1-mediated cell growth inhibition
without affecting ERK activation. These data suggest the existence of G-1 activated
but GPER-independent effects that remain to be clarified. In conclusion, this study
provides a rational to further study G-1 mechanism of action in order to include this
drug as a treatment option to the limited therapy of ACC.

patients. Severe side-effects, of either the gastrointestinal
or the nervous system, have been frequently reported,
and many patients are not able to take the drug regularly
[2, 3]. Recently, monoclonal antibodies targeting
insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGF1R) have
been tested in clinical trials, however, they provided a
limited effectiveness in refractory patients [4]. Rationale
for targeting IGF1R comes from the observation that IGFII
[5] is overexpressed in ACC. IGFII effects are mediated
through its receptor IGF1R resulting in activation of the

INTRODUCTION
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) represents a rare
malignancy with a very poor prognosis. Resectability is
the prime determinant of prognosis. For patients with
disseminated disease, chemotherapy options are few and
lack sufficient efficacy. Mitotane, a cytotoxic drug with
a not well documented mechanism of action [1], is the
conventional therapy. The toxicity of mitotane has been
a major limit to its suitability in the treatment of ACC

PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, the RAS/MAPK and the
PLC/PKC pathways [6]. We have recently demonstrated
that activation of these pathways can be triggered by the
estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) [7], a gene overexpressed
in ACC that mediates estrogen-dependent proliferative
effects [7, 8]. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated
that ESR1 knock down was more effective than an
IGF1R antibody in controlling H295R cell proliferation
[7]. Targeting ESR1 in vivo using tamoxifen, a selective
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), was effective in
reducing H295R xenografts growth [7].
It is well known that tamoxifen and its active
metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), not only exert
antiestrogenic activity [9], but also act as full agonist on
the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 (from the
GPER gene) [10–14]. Then, can Tamoxifen effects depend
on GPER activation? GPER can mediate rapid E2-induced
non-genomic signaling events, including stimulation of
adenylyl cyclase, mobilization of intracellular calcium
(Ca2+) stores and activation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling pathways [15–17]. GPER exhibits prognostic
utility in endometrial [18], ovarian [19], and breast cancer
[20] and can modulate growth of hormonally responsive
cancer cells [10, 11, 21, 22]. Expression of GPER has
been characterized in the outer zona glomerulosa (ZG)
and in the medulla of the human adrenal [23], however its
expression status in ACC is not known.
A non-steroidal, high-affinity GPER agonist
G-1 (1-[4-(6-bromobenzo [1, 3]dioxol-5yl)-3a, 4, 5,
9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta-[c]quinolin-8-yl]-ethanone)
has been developed to dissect GPER-mediated estrogen
responses from those mediated by classic estrogen receptors
[24]. The biological effects triggered by G-1 appear cell
type specific and dependent on the ERs expression pattern
[25–29]. By using G-1, in this study we wanted to investigate
the effects of GPER activation on ACC growth.

revealed a substantial decrease in protein content compared
to the control shRNA (insert,  Fig. 1F). However, GPER
silencing was able to only partially abrogate the inhibitory
effects exerted by G-1 on H295R cell proliferation (Fig. 1F)
H295R cells were used to generate xenograft tumors
in athymic nude mice. Twenty one days after tumor
grafting all mice developed a detectable tumor and were
randomized to be treated with either vehicle or G-1. G-1
administration produced a statistically significant decrease
in tumor volume from day 14 post treatment (Fig. 2A).
A trend of growth inhibition was observed thereafter. The
drug was well tolerated without lethal toxicity or body
weight loss during treatment (data not shown). Multislices T2-W MRI indicated larger tumor volume in vehicle
treated animals compared to tumors from G-1 treated mice.
Hyperintense large cystic area and haemorrahagic regions,
that appear as dark areas in the tumor sections, were
present in vehicle treated animals (Fig. 2B). Grafted tumors
harvested after three-week treatment with G-1 showed a
significant decrease in tumor weight compared to vehicle
treated animals (Fig. 2C). Hematoxylin and eosin staining
of xenograft tumors revealed some picnotic nuclei only
in G-1 treated tumors (Fig. 2D). Ki-67 immunostaimning
was significantly lower in G-1-treated tumors compared to
control mice (value score control: 6, 6 ± 0, 89 (SD); value
score G-1 treated cells: 3, 1 ± 0.55 * (SD) (*p < 0.05)
(Fig. 2E).

G-1 induces H295R cell cycle arrest and
cell death
Cell cycle analysis of H295R cells after 24 h of
G-1 treatment demonstrated a cell cycle arrest in the G2
phase (Fig 3A). This effect was further confirmed by a
change in the expression of cyclins, after G-1 treatment
(Fig. 3B). Specifically, by western analysis we observed
that G-1 treatment caused a decrease in Cyclin E (CCNE),
while Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), involved in the regulation
of G2 phase, was increased. CCNE and CCNB1 had
similar expression pattern in protein samples extracted
from xenografts tumors (Fig. 3C). Collectively these
events support the idea of cells exiting G1 but remaining
stuck in G2 phase. In agreement with the observation
that inappropriate accumulation of B type cyclins is
associated with the initiation of apoptotic pathways [30],
we found that G-1 caused cell death by apoptosis. Cells
were treated for 24 or 48 h with vehicle or G-1, incubated
with an Annexin-V specific antibody and sorted by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 3D the number of dead
cells increased in a time dependent manner reaching about
40% of apoptotic cells 48 h after G-1 treatment (Fig. 3D).

RESULTS
G-1 treatment decreases H295R cell growth in
vitro and in vivo
We first examined GPER expression in human ACCs
and in H295R cells. By western blot analysis (Fig. 1A)
and real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B-1C) we demonstrated
that GPER is expressed in normal adrenal, in human
ACCs and in H295R cells at variable levels. Effects of
G-1 on cell viability and proliferation were tested using
increasing concentrations (0.01-0.1-1 μM) for different
times (24-48-72 h) (Fig. 1D-1E). Of the different doses
tested only 1 μM caused a time-dependent reduction in
H295R cell growth. Doses higher than 1uM did not show
any more pronounced effect (data not shown). Knocking
down of GPER gene expression, using a specific shRNA,
(shGPER) was assessed by western blot analysis and

TUNEL staining demonstrated the presence of increased

addition, Hoechst staining evidenced that untreated
H295R cells had round nuclei with regular contours; while

irregularly shaped or degraded with condensed DNA.
DNA gel electrophoresis extracted from G-1 treated
H295R cells revealed a classic laddering pattern of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation that was absent in
control cells (Fig. 4B). This event was associated with
an increase in Parp-1 cleavage (Fig. 4C). The presence
of G-1 increased Bax expression while decreased Bcl-2
(Fig. 4D). Similarly, data obtained from western blot

analysis of tumors samples overlap with those obtained
in H295R cells (Fig. 4E). When the intrinsic apoptotic
mechanism is triggered, Cytochrome c (Cyt c) is
released from the mitochondria into the cytosol [31].
Therefore we fractionated G-1 treated H295R cell lysates
into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and evaluated
Cytochrome c release by western blot analysis (Fig. 4F).
Cytochrome c levels increased in the cytosolic fraction
of treated samples while decreased in the mitochondrial
compartment. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria
into the cytosol triggers caspase activation. After G-1
treatment we detected active Caspase 9 (Fig. 4G) as well
as the executioner Caspase 3/7 (Fig. 4H).

as seen by the increased levels of their phosphorylation
status. Activation started after 30-min of G-1 treatment
and persisted for up to 24 h (Fig. 5A). ShGPER, that
partially reversed G-1 effects on cell proliferation
(Fig. 1E) did not affect ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5B).
Involvement of ERK1/2 in G-1-induced apoptosis
of adrenocortical cancer cells was confirmed by the
observation that MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, prevented
the up-regulatory  effect exerted by G-1 on Bax
expression (Fig. 5C).

In order to define the molecular mechanism
associated with G-1-induced apoptosis, we investigated
the activation of MAPK family members extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which have been
demonstrated to be involved in apoptosis if activated
for a prolonged time [32]. As shown in Figure 5A, G-1
treatment activated ERK1/2 in a time-dependent manner

DISCUSSION

The active Caspase 3 is then involved in the cleavage of a
set of proteins including Poly-(ADP) ribose polymerase-1
(Parp-1) [43]. Bcl-2, instead, exerts its anti-apoptotic
activity, at least in part, by inhibiting the translocation
of Bax to the mitochondria [40]. Changes in expression
and/or activation of all the above mentioned biochemical
markers of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were
observed in H295R cells in response to G-1 treatment.
MAPK family members ERK1/2 are part of
GPER signaling [14]. Despite the well-defined role
of ERK1/2 activation in proliferative pathways [44],
sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation is involved in
apoptotic events [29, 32, 45]. Cagnol and Chambard
have summarized more than 50 publications showing a
link between prolonged ERK activation and apoptosis
[46]. Specifically it can be appreciated that duration of
ERK activation in promoting cell death can be different
depending on cell type and stimuli. G-1 caused sustained
ERK1/2 activation in H295R, this event was clearly
involved in the induction of apoptosis, since chemical
inhibition of MEK1/2 using PD98059 abrogated G-1
ability to induce the expression of proapoptotic factor
Bax. Several reports pointed out that ERK1/2 activity
can be associated with upregulation of proapoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax [47–49].
Moreover, ERK activity has been shown to directly affect
mitochondrial function [46] by decreasing mitochondrial
respiration [50, 51] and mitochondrial membrane
potential [51, 52], causing mitochondrial membrane
disruption and Cytochrome c release [52–54].
Interestingly, GPER silencing was not able to
prevent G-1 induced ERK phosphorylation, underlying
the existence of alternative targets for G-1. These targets,
similarly to GPER, are able to activate ERK1/2 signaling,
however for a prolonged period, and clearly deserve
further investigation.
Other papers evidenced inhibitory effects exerted by
G-1 on the growth of different tumor cell types in a GPER
independent manner [55–57], but a precise mechanism has
not been defined. Although further studies are needed to
clarify the molecular mechanisms behind G-1-dependent
effects, this molecule could be a viable alternative to the
current limited treatment options and therapeutic efficacy
for adrenocortical cancer.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that treatment of
H295R cells with G-1 reduced tumor growth in vitro and
in vivo through a mechanism involving not only GPER
activation. G-1 clearly causes cell-cycle arrest at the G2
phase and apoptosis through a mechanism that requires
sustained ERK1/2 activation. Our previously published
results highlighting the ability of OHT, a known GPER
agonist and ESR1 antagonist, to reduce ACC cell growth,
together with the present findings indicating the inhibitory
effects exerted by G-1, open up new perspectives for the
development of therapies with molecules modulating
estrogen receptors action for the treatment of ACC.

Here, we demonstrated for the first time that a
selective non estrogenic ligand of GPER named G-1 is
able to inhibit H295R cell growth both in vitro and in vivo
in a xenograft model. Starting from these results we
investigated the potential role of GPER in this event.
First, we showed GPER expression both at
transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in our ACC
cell model represented by H295R cells as well as in
normal adrenal and ACC samples. These first analyses
aimed to assess only if GPER was expressed in normal
and tumor adrenal and not to indicate any difference in
expression levels, since overexpression of GPCR is not a
common event in human diseases [20].
Recent studies have shown that activation of
GPER initiates signaling cascades that, depending on the
cell type, are associated with both proliferation [11, 33]
and apoptosis [29, 32]. Ariazi et al. have highlighted
the opposite effects played by GPER activation on cell
proliferation of ERs negative and ERs positive breast
cancer cells [17]. Specifically, when ERs are expressed,
activation of GPER leads to inhibition of cell proliferation.
On the contrary, when cells are ERs negative activation of
GPER leads to an increase in cell proliferation [17]. Our
work, demonstrated that micromolar concentrations of G-1
decrease H295R cell proliferation in vitro, significantly
reduce ACC tumor volume in vivo and cause a marked
decrease in the expression of the nuclear proliferation
antigen Ki-67. Accordingly, flow cytometry analysis
revealed that G-1 treatment causes changes in cellular
distribution within the different phases of cell cycle. It is
well established that cell cycle progression is dynamically
and strictly regulated by complexes containing cyclins
and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) [34]. Here, we
found that after G-1 treatment expression of G1 phase
cyclin CCNE was reduced, while G2 phase cyclin CCNB1
was increased. This observation indicates that H295R cells
do not bypass G2 checkpoint. Similar data were reported
for prostate cancer cells, where GPER activation by 1 μM
G-1 caused cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase [35]. G2 phase
arrest was followed by apoptotic cell death as indicated
by positive staining for Annexin-V, nuclei morphological
changes and appearance of DNA ladder pattern.
Apoptosis can be induced by extrinsic [36] and
intrinsic [37] mechanisms; the latter is strictly controlled
by bcl-2 family of proteins [38] that consists of both
pro- (Bax, Bad, Bak, Bid) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2,
Bcl-xl) proteins able to modulate the execution phase
of the cell death pathway. Bax exerts pro-apoptotic
activity by allowing Cytochrome c translocation from the
mitochondria to the cytosol [39]. Cytochrome c then binds
to apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) [40],
which in turn associates with Procaspase 9 resulting in the
activation of its enzymatic activity [41], responsible for
the proteolytic activation of executioner Caspase 3 [42].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SKBR3 and ACCs. Each RNA sample was treated
with DNase I (Invitrogen), and purity and integrity of
the RNA were confirmed spectroscopically and by gel
electrophoresis before use. One microgram of total
RNA was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 30 μl
using the ImProm-II Reverse transcription system kit
(Promega Italia S.r.l., Milano, Italia); cDNA was diluted
1:2 in nuclease-free water, aliquoted, and stored at − 20°C.
The nucleotide sequences for GPER amplification were
forward, 5′-CGCTCTTCCTGCAGGTCAA-3′, and
reverse, 5′-ATGTAGCGGTCGAAGCTCATC-3′ ; the
nucleotide sequences for GAPDH amplification were
forward, 5′-CCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGAC-3′, and
reverse, 5′-TGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTT-3′. PCR
reactions were performed in the iCycler iQ Detection
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories S.r.l., Milano, Italia)
using 0.1 μmol/L of each primer, in a total volume of
30 μl reaction mixture following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. SYBR Green Universal PCR Master
Mix (Bio-Rad) with the dissociation protocol was used
for gene amplification; negative controls contained water
instead of first-strand cDNA. Each sample was normalized
to its GAPDH content. The relative gene expression levels
were normalized to a calibrator (normal tissue for ACC
tissues or SKBR3 for H295R cells). Final results were
expressed as n-fold differences in gene expression relative
to GAPDH and calibrator, calculated using the ΔΔCt
method as previously shown [61].

Cell culture and tissues
H295R cells were obtained from Dr W.E. Rainey
(University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, USA) [58]. Cells were
cultured as previously described [9]. Cell monolayers were
subcultured onto 100 mm dishes for phosphatase activity and
laddering assay (8 × 106 cells/plate), 60 mm dishes for protein
and RNA extraction (4 × 106 cells/plate) and 24 well culture
dishes for proliferation experiments (2  ×  105 cells/well)
and grown for 2 days. Prior to experiments, cells  were
starved overnight in DMEM/F-12 medium without phenol
red and containing antibiotics. Cells were treated with
(±)-1-[(3aR*, 4S*, 9bS*)-4-(6-Bromo-1, 3-benzodioxol5-yl)-3a, 4, 5, 9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl]ethanone (G-1) (1 μM) (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) in
DMEM/F-12 containing FBS-DCC 2, 5% (fetal bovine
serum dextran-coated charcoal-treated). Inhibitors PD98059
(PD) (10 μM) (Calbiochem, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany) was used 1 h prior to G-1. Adrenocortical
tumors, removed at surgery, and normal adrenal cortex,
macroscopically dissected from adrenal glands of kidney
donors, were collected at the hospital-based Divisions of the
University of Padua (Italy). Tissue samples were obtained
with the approval of local ethics committees and consent
from patients, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
guidelines as revised in 1983. Diagnosis of malignancy was
performed according to the histopathologic criteria proposed
by Weiss et al. [59] and the modification proposed by Aubert
et al. [60]. Clinical data of the six ACC patients included
in this study are shown in Table 1. Patient C6 terminated
mitotane treatment six months after beginning of therapy
for severe gastrointestinal side effects. Patients C1 and C2
were treated with chemotherapy EAP protocol (etoposide,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin) + mitotane.

Western blot analysis
Fifty μg of protein was subjected to western
blot analysis [62]. Blots were incubated overnight at
4°C with antibodies against GPER, Cyclin E (CCNE),
Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), phospho-Rb, Cytochrome c, Bax,
Bcl-2, Parp1, pERK1/2-ERK2 (all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA, USA). Membranes
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and immunoreactive bands
were visualized with the ECL western blotting detection
system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and real
time PCR
TRizol RNA isolation system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) was used to extract total RNA from H295R,

(PI) (100 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) after treatment with
RNase A (20 μg/ml). The DNA content was measured
using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA, USA) and the data acquired using
CellQuest software. Cell cycle profiles were determined
using ModFit LT program. Subconfluent monolayers
growing in 60 mm plates were depleted of serum for
24 h and treated for 24 and 48 h with G-1. Trypsinized
cells were incubated with Ligation Buffer (10 mM Hepes
(pH = 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and
1.8 mM CaCl2) containing Annexin-V-FITC (1:5000)
(Santa Cruz) and with Propidium Iodide. Twenty minutes
post-incubation at room temperature (RT) protected from
light, samples were examined in a FACSCalibur cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Milano, Italy). Results were analyzed
using CellQuest program.

Histopathological analysis
Tumors were fixed in 4% formalin, sectioned at
5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, as suggested
by the manufacturer (Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy).

Immunohistochemical analysis
Paraffin-embedded sections, 5 mm thick, were
mounted on slides precoated with poly-lysine, and then
they were deparaffinized and dehydrated (seven to eight
serial sections). Immunohistochemical experiments
were performed as described [63], using mouse
monoclonal Ki-67 primary antibody at 4°C over-night
(Dako Italia Spa, Milano, Italy). Then, a biotinylated
goat-anti-mouse IgG was applied for 1 h at room
temperature, to form the avidin biotin-horseradish
peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, CA,
USA). Immunoreactivity was visualized by using the
diaminobenzi-dine chromogen (Vector Laboratories).
Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin (BioOptica, Milano, Italy). The primary antibody was replaced
by normal rabbit serum in negative control sections.

Caspases 9 and 3/7 activity assay
H295R cells after treatments were subjected to
caspases 9 and 3/7 activity measurement with CaspaseGlo 9 and 3/7 assay kits (Promega) and modified protocol.
Briefly, the proluminescent substrate containing LEHD or
DEVD sequences (sequences are in a single-letter amino
acid code) are respectively cleaved by Caspases 9 and
3/7. After caspases cleavage, a substrate for luciferase
(aminoluciferin) is released resulting in luciferase reaction
luminescent signal production. Cells were trypsinized,
harvested and then suspended in DMEM-F12 before being
incubated with an equal volume of Caspase-Glo reagent
(40 μl) at 37°C for 1 h. The luminescence of each sample
was measured in a plate-reading luminometer (Gen5 2.01)
with Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader.

Cytochrome c detection
Cells were treated for 24 h, fractioned and processed
for Cytochrome c detection as previously reported
[26]. Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation at
2500  rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended
in 50 μl of sucrose buffer (250 mM sucrose; 10 mM
Hepes; 10 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM
EGTA) (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy) containing
20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF and
0.05% digitonine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated
for 20 min at 4°C and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
15 min at 4°C. Supernatants containing cytosolic protein
fraction were transferred to new tubes and the resulting
mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of lysis
buffer (1% Triton X-100; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA;
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) (all from Sigma-Aldrich)
containing 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin,
1  mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) and then centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Equal amounts of proteins
were resolved by 11% SDS/polyacrylamide gel as
indicated in the Western blot analysis paragraph.

TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated dUTP nick-end labelling) assay
Cells were grown on glass coverslips, treated
for 24 h and then washed with PBS and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed
cells were washed with PBS and then soaked for
20  min with 0.25% of Triton X-100 in PBS. After two
washes in deionized water, they were stained using the
Click-iT® TUNEL Alexa Fluor® Imaging Assay
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Co-staining with Hoechst33342 was performed to analyze
the nuclear morphology of the cells after the treatment.
Cell nuclei were observed and imaged under an inverted
fluorescence microscope (200X magnification).

Determination of DNA fragmentation

Cell cycle analysis and evaluation of cell death

To determine the occurrence of DNA
fragmentation, total DNA was extracted from control
and G-1 (1 μM) treated (48 h) cells as previously
described [26]. Equal amounts of DNA were analyzed

Subconfluent monolayers growing in 60 mm plates
were depleted of serum for 24 h and treated for an additional
24 h with G-1. The cells were harvested by trypsinization

randomly assigned to be treated with vehicle or G-1
(Tocris Bioscience) at a concentration of 2 mg/kg/daily.
Drug tolerability was assessed in tumor-bearing mice in
terms of: a) lethal toxicity, i.e. any death in treated mice
occurring before any death in control mice; b) body weight
loss percentage = 100 − [(body weight on day x/body
weight on day 1) × 100], where x represents a day during
the treatment period [66, 67]. Animals were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation 42 days after cell injection. All animal
procedures were approved by Local Ethics Committee for
Animal Research.

Assessment of cell proliferation
[3H]Thymidine incorporation assay
H295R cell proliferation after G-1 treatment was
directly evaluated after a 6 h incubation with 1 μCi of
[3H]thymidine (Perkin- Elmer Life Sciences, Boston,
MA, USA) per well as previously described [64]. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and results are
expressed as percent (%) of basal.

In vivo magnetic resonance analyses

MTT assay

Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isofluorane
in O2, 1 L/min (Forane, Abbott SpA, Latina, Italia)
and underwent MRI/MRS study. MR analyses were
performed at 4.7 T on Agilent Technologies system (Palo
Alto, CA, USA). T2-weighted MRI was acquired using
a spin echo sequence with the following parameters:
TR/TE = 3000/70 ms, section thickness of 1.0 mm,
number of acquisitions = 4, point resolution of 256 μm.

The effect of G-1 on cell viability was measured
using 3-[4, 5-Dimethylthiaoly]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay as previously described [7]. Briefly,
cells were treated for different times as indicated in
figure legends. At the end of each time point fresh MTT
(Sigma-Aldrich), re-suspended in PBS, was added to each
well (final concentration 0.33 mg/ml). After 30 minutes
incubation, cells were lysed with 1 ml of DMSO (SigmaAldrich). Each experiment was performed in triplicate
and the optical density was measured at 570 nm in a
spectrophotometer.

Scoring system
The immunostained slides of tumor samples were
evaluated by light microscopy using the Allred Score [68]
which combines a proportion score and an intensity score.
A proportion score was assigned representing the estimated
proportion of positively stained tumor cells (0 = none;
1 = 1/100; 2 = 1/100 to < 1/10; 3 = 1/10 to < 1/3; 4 = 1/3
to 2/3; 5 = > 2/3). An intensity score was assigned by the
average estimated intensity of staining in positive cells
(0 = none; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong). Proportion
score and intensity score were added to obtain a total score
that ranged from 0 to 8. A minimum of 100 cells were
evaluated in each slide. Six to seven serial sections were
scored in a blinded manner for each sample.

Gene silencing experiments
For the gene silencing experiments, cells were plated
in 12 well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) for proliferation
experiments or in 6 well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) for
Western blot analysis; cells were transfected with control
vector (shRNA) or shGPER in 2, 5% DCC-FBS medium
using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for a
total of 72 h. For proliferation experiments cells were
transfected for 24 h and then treated for 48 h before
performing MTT assay.

Data analysis and statistical methods

Xenograft model

All experiments were performed at least three times.
Data were expressed as mean values + standard error
(SE), statistical significance between control (basal) and
treated samples was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, CA) software. Control
and treated groups were compared using the analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni or Dunn’s post hoc
testing. A comparison of individual treatments was also
performed, using Student’s t test. Significance was defined
as p < 0.05.

Four-week-old nu/nu − Forkhead box N1nu female
mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Italia
(Calco, Lecco, Italy). All animals were maintained in
groups of five or less and quarantined for two weeks. Mice
were kept on a 12 h/12 h light/dark regimen and allowed
access to food and water ad libitum. H295R cells, 6 × 106,
suspended in 100 μl PBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered
Saline), were combined with 30 μl of Matrigel (4 mg/ml)
(Becton Dickinson) and injected subcutaneously in the
shoulder of each animal. Resulting tumors were measured
at regular intervals using a caliper, and tumor volume was
calculated as previously described [65], using the formula:
V = 0.52 (L × W 2), where L is the longest axis of the tumor
and W is perpendicular to the long axis. Mice were treated
21 days after cell injection, when tumors had reached
an average volume of about 200 mm3. Animals were
