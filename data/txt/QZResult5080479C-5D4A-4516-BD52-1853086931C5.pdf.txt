Trastuzumab-based chemotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with all stages of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Additional HER2-directed agents that have recently been approved are also expected
to improve outcomes. Patients with small, lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancers who are treated with trastuzumabbased chemotherapy demonstrate especially favorable responses, with 5-year recurrence rates of <5%. In this review, recent data
regarding response rates among patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy are discussed. This review supports future studies of the possible omission of chemotherapy in a subset of patients with HER2C 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 25% of breast cancers overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase. HER2-positive cancers are characterized by an aggressive clinical course with a high propensity for distant metastases within 5 years of diagnosis.1,2 The use of trastuzumab-based chemotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes
for patients with all stages of HER2-positive breast cancer.3-6 The median survival for patients with metastatic, HER2positive breast cancer is approximately 3 years7; survival is expected to increase even further because of the approval of
additional HER2-directed agents.8,9 Adjuvant trials have demonstrated significant reductions in disease recurrence and
improvements in survival for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancers who are treated with trastuzumabbased chemotherapy.3,5,6 There has been increased interest in the use of neoadjuvant HER2-directed agents with chemotherapy using pathologic complete response (pCR) as a surrogate for long-term outcome. For example, the combination
of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel was recently approved in the preoperative setting for patients with HER2positive breast cancers.10
Some retrospective analyses of patients with small HER2-positive cancers have demonstrated worse outcomes compared with those achieved in patients with other breast cancer subtypes.11,12 In contrast, the results of other studies have
indicated that outcomes are more favorable, with low recurrence rates reported in patients with small HER2-positive
breast cancers. Although patients with these cancers were underrepresented in the pivotal adjuvant trials, a recent metaanalysis of these trials has demonstrated favorable outcomes for patients with small HER2-positive breast cancers who
were treated with adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.13 The meta-analysis further demonstrated that the addition
of trastuzumab to chemotherapy improves outcomes in these patients compared with chemotherapy alone.14 Recent adjuvant trials evaluated the addition of other targeted agents, including bevazicumab and lapatinib, to trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy; these trials included a larger percentage of patients with lymph node-negative breast cancers and clearly
demonstrated more favorable outcomes in patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancers.15,16 Such favorable
outcomes beg the question of whether some patients should be treated with less aggressive therapeutic regimens, and
whether they should be omitted from trials examining the addition of other HER2-directed agents to trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy.

Short durations of chemotherapy in combination
with trastuzumab have been reported to reduce recurrence
rates in patients with lymph node-negative breast cancers
that measure <3 cm.17 A key question is whether chemotherapy can be omitted in a subset of patients with HER2positive cancers, particularly those that coexpress hormone receptors (HRs). Historically, HER2 was accepted
as the predominant driver of HER2-positive, HR-positive
breast cancers based on data from preoperative trials.10,18
However, molecular profiling studies have strongly suggested that estrogen receptor (ER) signaling is critical in a
subset of these cancers.19 Extensive crosstalk exists
between the ER and HER2 pathways, such that inhibition
of HER2 alone can activate ER signaling. Increased ER
signaling provides an escape mechanism, causing the development of resistance to HER2-directed agents.
According to what to our knowledge are only limited data
in the preoperative setting, a subset of patients with
HER2-positive, HR-positive cancers may be adequately
treated with coinhibition of HER2 and ER without the
need for chemotherapy.10,20 Herein, we review recent
data indicating that patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancers who are treated with trastuzumabbased chemotherapy have favorable outcomes. We also
518

discuss the literature supporting the need to further evaluate the possible omission of chemotherapy in a subset of
patients with HER2-positive cancers, specifically those
that coexpress HR.
Prognosis of Small HER2-Positive Breast
Cancers Before the Use of Trastuzumab

Several retrospective analyses have demonstrated that
patients with small HER2-positive breast cancers have inferior outcomes compared with those of patients with
other breast cancer subtypes. However, recent data have
challenged this concept and demonstrated favorable outcomes for patients with small HER2-positive breast cancers (Table 1).11,12,21-25
A retrospective analysis of 960 patients with stage I
tumors demonstrated that HER2-positive status is a significant negative prognostic factor affecting 1-year disease-free survival (DFS).11 Rouanet et al evaluated the
prognosis of patients with T1a-bN0 breast cancers according to HER2 and HR status12 and noted that the 10-year
DFS rate was significantly lower in the HER2-positive
group compared with the HER2-negative group. The
worse prognosis associated with HER2 status did not differ among patients with HR-positive tumors, who had a

poor prognosis regardless whether they received endocrine
therapy. A tissue microarray study of >2000 tumors, in
which HER2 was overexpressed in 10% of cases, demonstrated that patients with HER2-positive tumors had inferior outcomes compared with those with HER2-negative
cancers. Patients with HER2-positive disease demonstrated inferior 10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS),
distant RFS, and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS),
with a trend toward worse overall survival (OS).21 However, among patients with stage I disease, HER2 expression was not found to be associated with worse RFS or
OS, although BCSS was lower in patients with HER2positive cancers. It is interesting to note that among
patients with HR-positive breast cancers, HER2 overexpression did not appear to impact outcome, whereas it
had a negative impact in patients with HR-negative cancers. HER2 overexpression was also found to be associated
with worse RFS and distant RFS in nearly 1000 patients
with T1a or T1b lymph node-negative breast cancer who
did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or trastuzumab,
among whom 10% were HER2 positive.22 An Italian
study identified 150 patients with HER2-overexpressing,
T1a-b N0 disease who did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab and compared outcomes with HER2-negative
matched controls.23 The study reported that after a median follow-up of 4.6 years, the 5-year DFS rate was
>90% for all subgroups. In the HR-positive group,
HER2 overexpression decreased the DFS rate from 99%
to 92%. In contrast, HER2 status did not affect prognosis
in the HR-negative group (92% vs 91%).
Most recently, Fehrenbacher et al reported on the
invasive recurrence risk in 234 patients with small (T1a
and T1b) HER2-overexpressing breast cancers diagnosed
between 2000 and 2006.24 Only 8.1% of these patients
received trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy. For
all tumors, the 5-year recurrence-free interval (RFI) was
94.1%; the 5-year RFI for patients with ER-positive and
ER-negative tumors was 94.9% and 95.1%, respectively.
The risk was lower for patients with tumors measuring
<1 cm when compared with those whose tumors measured 1 cm, which was associated with a 5-year RFI rate of
84.5%. The distant RFI rate was 98.2% for patients with
T1a tumors compared with 89.4% for those with tumors
measuring 1 cm.24 Vaz-Luis et al published outcomes
from a prospective cohort of 4113 women with T1a and
T1b, lymph node-negative breast cancer.25 They noted
520 patients with HER2-positive disease, with approximately one-third of these patients being treated with trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy. The 5-year OS
and BCSS rates were >90% in all subsets. The 5-year
Cancer

February 15, 2015

distant RFS in patients with HER2-positive, T1b tumors
who did not receive any adjuvant therapy was 94%
regardless of HR status; among patients treated with
chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab, the distant
RFS rate was 94% in those with HR-negative tumors and
96% in those with HR-positive tumors.
In summary, these retrospective analyses suggest
that patients with stage I HER2-positive cancers may have
worse outcomes compared with those with other breast
cancer subtypes. However, more recent studies24,25 have
suggested that small HER2-positive cancers have favorable outcomes overall, even in the absence of
trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. The data from these
retrospective analyses are presented in Table 1.11,12,21-25
Benefit of Trastuzumab-Based Chemotherapy
Among Patients With Small HER2-Positive
Cancers

Small lymph node-negative cancers were underrepresented in the pivotal adjuvant trastuzumab trials.26 Joint
analysis of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group
(NCCTG) N9831 and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31 trials and the FinHER
trial primarily included patients with lymph nodepositive breast cancer.27-29 The NCCTG trial was
amended to allow patients with lymph node-negative disease that was either >2 cm and HR positive or >1 cm and
HR negative.15 This cohort comprised <10% of the
patients accrued, and therefore no definitive conclusions
could be made. Approximately one-third of patients on
the Breast Cancer International Research Group
(BCIRG) 006 trial had lymph node-negative breast cancer.15 However, only patients with high-risk lymph nodenegative tumors were eligible; these cases were defined as
being HR negative, at least 2 cm in size, grade 2 to 3, or
occurring among patients aged <35 years.3 Among
patients with lymph node-negative disease, the DFS rate
at 5 years was 85% for the control arm (doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel), 93% for the
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel
plus trastuzumab arm, and 90% for the docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab arm. The HERceptin Adjuvant
(HERA) trial, in which patients were randomized to observation or trastuzumab for 12 or 24 months after standard chemotherapy, recruited approximately one-third of
patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer. The
DFS rate was improved by 8.4% at 2 years and by 6.4% at
4 years in patients receiving trastuzumab. Furthermore,
DFS was significantly better in patients with negative
lymph nodes and T1 tumors. The 3-year DFS rates for

patients in adjuvant trials that accrued a reasonable number of patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer are
shown in Table 2.3,5,16,17,26,30
A recent meta-analysis specifically addressed outcomes in patients with small HER2-positive breast cancers who were treated with trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy in the pivotal adjuvant trials.13 The analysis included patients with cancers measuring 2 cm who
were treated with trastuzumab and enrolled on the
HERA, NCCTG, BCIRG, NSABP B31, PACS-04, or
FinHER trials. Nearly 1400 patients with HR-positive,
HER2-positive cancers and >1200 patients with
HR-negative, HER2-positive cancers were included. The
5-year DFS and OS rates were 92% and 97%, respectively, for patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive,
lymph node-negative breast cancers measuring 2 cm.
The 5-year DFS and OS rates were 83% and 94%, respectively, for patients with HR-negative, HER2-positive,
lymph node-negative breast cancers measuring 2 cm.
When patients with tumors measuring 2 cm who were
lymph node negative or had 1 positive lymph node were
evaluated, the 5-year DFS and OS rates were 91% and
97%, respectively, for patients with HR-positive cancers
measuring 2 cm who were lymph node negative or had
1 positive lymph node. The 5-year DFS and OS rates
were 84% and 95%, respectively, for patients with HRnegative cancers measuring 2 cm who were lymph node
negative or had 1 positive lymph node. Given the favorable outcomes, the authors examined the benefit of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy in patients with small
HER2-positive cancers.14 The analysis included 2588
520

patients who received trastuzumab compared with 1632
who did not, and was performed separately for patients
with HR-positive and HR-negative cancers. The addition
of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was found to significantly decrease disease recurrence by 8% (P<.001) and
death by 3.8% (P 5 .05) at 8 years in patients with
HER2-positive, HR-positive breast cancers measuring
2 cm regardless of lymph node status. In patients with
HER2-positive, HR-positive breast cancers measuring
2 cm with 0 or 1 positive lymph nodes, the addition of
trastuzumab to chemotherapy decreased the rate of disease
recurrence by 6.7% (P 5 .005) and death by 2.1%
(P 5 .12) at 8 years. In patients with HER2-positive, HRnegative tumors measuring 2 cm, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy significantly decreased the rate of
disease recurrence by 9.4% (P 5 .0001) and death by
8.8% (P 5 .0001) at 8 years. Overall, the authors concluded that patients with stage I HER2-positive cancers
have favorable outcomes with standard trastuzumabbased regimens and could potentially be omitted from
future trials evaluating the addition of newer agents to
standard trastuzumab-based regimens.
Does the Addition of Other Targeted Agents
Improve Outcome Among Patients With
Early-Stage HER2-Positive Breast Cancer?

Despite encouraging data from neoadjuvant trials, to the
best of our knowledge the addition of other targeted
agents to adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy in
patients with early-stage breast cancer has not yet been
shown to improve outcome. The BETH trial evaluated
the addition of bevacizumab to standard trastuzumabbased chemotherapy in patients with early-stage HER2positive breast cancer.16 Patients with lymph nodenegative breast cancers were eligible if they had tumors
measuring >20 mm, tumors that were ER negative and
PR negative, tumors of grade 2 or 3, or who were aged
<35 years. Nearly 50% of patients accrued had lymph
node-negative breast cancers, and almost 60% had HRpositive cancers. Overall, the 3-year DFS and OS rates
were 92% and 96%, respectively, in the control arm. The
addition of bevacizumab did not appear to improve outcome. For patients with lymph node-negative disease, the
3-year DFS rate was 96%. The Adjuvant Lapatinib and/
or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (ALTTO) trial
evaluated the addition of lapatinib concurrently or
sequentially with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. The
ALTTO trial accrued >6000 patients; 40% of patients
had lymph node-negative disease and 57% had HRpositive disease. At 4 years of follow-up, there was no

significant difference noted between treatment arms in
terms of DFS (86% for trastuzumab, 88% for concurrent
lapatinib and trastuzumab, and 87% for trastuzumab followed by lapatinib) or OS (94% for trastuzumab, 95%
for concurrent lapatinib and trastuzumab, and 95% for
trastuzumab followed by lapatinib). The DFS rate ranged
from 88% to 90% and 83% to 86%, respectively, for
patients with HR-positive and HR-negative cancers. The
DFS for patients with lymph node-negative disease was
not presented. Although both the BETH and ALTTO trials failed to demonstrate benefit from the addition of
other targeted agents to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy, they confirmed favorable outcomes in patients with
early-stage, HER2-positive cancers who were treated with
trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.16 In addition, the AFFINITY trial currently is evaluating the addition of pertuzumab to adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.
Is Less Therapy Appropriate For a Subset of
Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer?

Favorable outcomes were noted in adjuvant trials that
included patients with lymph node-negative breast cancers (Table 2)3,5,16,17,26,30 and in the meta-analysis of
patients with cancers measuring 2 cm13; thus, a key
question is whether a subset of patients with HER2positive cancers can be treated with a less aggressive
approach. Although this subset has yet to be defined, it
may be reasonable to evaluate a less aggressive approach in
patients with lymph node-negative HER2-positive
cancers.
The APT trial evaluated paclitaxel for 12 weeks with
trastuzumab followed by single-agent trastuzumab for a
total of 1 year in patients with lymph node-negative
HER2-positive breast cancers measuring 3 cm.17 The
DFS rate at 3 years was extremely favorable at >98% (Table 2).3,5,16,17,26,30 Although the follow-up of this trial is
limited and the design is a single-arm study, the results are
intriguing because they suggest that less treatment may be
appropriate in some patients. The APT regimen will be
compared with trastuzumab emtansine in patients with
small, HER2-positive breast cancers.
To the best of our knowledge, to date only 2 trials,
both of which were performed in the neoadjuvant setting,
have evaluated a nonchemotherapy approach in patients
with HER2-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer. Rimawi
et al evaluated dual inhibition of HER2 with trastuzumab
and lapatinib for 12 weeks before surgery, with the addition of letrozole for tumors that were also HR positive,
among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.31
The pCR rate was 28% overall and 21% and 40%,
Cancer

February 15, 2015

respectively, for patients with HR-positive and HRnegative cancers. The rate of combined pCR and nearpCR, defined as <1 cm of residual disease after preoperative therapy, was 53%. Patients in group C of the NeoSphere trial,10 which evaluated the addition of
pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy, were
treated with pertuzumab and trastuzumab alone in the absence of docetaxel every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The overall
pCR rate was 17%. The PCR was 6% and 29%, respectively, in patients with HR-positive and HR-negative
tumors. Both of these trials suggest, but do not confirm,
that chemotherapy can be omitted in a subset of
undefined patients with HER2-positive breast cancers.
HR-Positive, HER2-Positive Breast Cancers

Since its discovery, there has been a general consensus that
the HER2 oncogene is the dominant driver of breast cancer biology when it is overexpressed, regardless of HR status. Benz et al demonstrated that transfection of HER2
into ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells rendered
them resistant to tamoxifen.32 Retrospective analyses have
demonstrated that patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancers achieved little, if any, benefit from tamoxifen.33 Prospective trials demonstrated a
median progression-free survival (PFS) of <3 months
among patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors in
the first-line setting. In contrast, the median PFS was
nearly 15 months in patients with HR-positive, HER2
negative breast cancer. Although the addition of HER2directed agents to aromatase inhibitors was demonstrated
to increase PFS for patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic cancers,34,35 this approach has not been
widely accepted. These findings support the concept that
HER2 is the prominent driver even when ER is expressed.
However, trials in which patients were treated with
HER2-directed agents with or without chemotherapy
consistently demonstrate a lower pCR in patients with
HR-positive, HER2-positive cancer compared with those
with HR-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer (Table
3).10,11,36-41 In addition, pCR is a less robust indicator of
recurrence risk among patients with HR-positive, HER2positive breast cancer compared with those with HRnegative, HER2-positive breast cancer. von Minckwitz
et al demonstrated that pCR was an important predictor
of outcome in patients with HR-negative, HER2-positive
breast cancer but was not significantly prognostic among
those with HR-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer.42
Although a recent meta-analysis did demonstrate that
pCR was prognostic in patients with HR-positive, HER2521

positive breast cancer, it was found to be a weaker predictor of outcome compared with HR-negative, HER2-positive breast cancers.43 These data clearly suggest distinct
differences between HR-positive and HR-negative,
HER2-positive breast cancers. Results of the TAnDEM
trial, in which patients with metastatic HR-positive,
HER-positive breast cancers were randomized to receive
anastrozole alone or with trastuzumab as first-line treatment, demonstrated a prolonged PFS in approximately
20% of patients treated with anastrozole alone.35
However, pCR rates among patients with HRpositive, HER2-positive breast cancers are considerably
higher than what is expected in patients with HR-positive,
HER2-negative breast cancers, especially those with a
luminal A phenotype. This suggests the presence of different subgroups within the HR-positive, HER2-positive
group. Bhargava et al correlated pCR with HR expression
levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancers
treated preoperatively with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.44 They noted an inverse correlation between the
level of HR expression and pCR; pCR rates were 52% in
those with HR-negative cancers, 33% in patients with
moderate ER expression, and only 8% in those with high
ER and progesterone receptor expression. The most conclusive data supporting the heterogeneity of HR-positive,
522

HER2-positive breast cancer is that approximately 35%
of these cancers have a luminal A phenotype, and nearly
50% have a luminal B phenotype, according to intrinsic
subtyping (Fig. 1).11,45 Because luminal A cancers are
believed to be driven predominantly by the ER, this subset
could explain the lower pCR noted in preoperative trials.
To the best of our knowledge, the 21-gene recurrence
score has not been demonstrated to be useful in the management of patients with HER2-positive cancers because
nearly all have intermediate or high recurrence scores.36
In contrast, when using the 70-gene signature, a group of
HER2-positive cancers that were also HR positive were
demonstrated to have a favorable signature.46
Crosstalk Between the ER and HER2 Pathways

Bidirectional crosstalk between ER and HER2 is observed
in multiple cell culture and animal models of ER-positive,
HER2-positive breast cancer.47 ER-HER2 crosstalk is recognized as a potential mediator of endocrine resistance.48
However, compelling data have suggested that this crosstalk may also contribute to the development of resistance
to HER2-targeted therapies. As we previously reviewed,36
HER2 signaling reduces ER expression, whereas HER2
inhibition by trastuzumab or lapatinib induces ER transcription (Fig. 2).36,37,41,49 To the best of our knowledge,

Figure 1. Intrinsic subtyping of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers is shown.
Intrinsic subtyping of HER2-positive breast cancers was performed before the administration of preoperative chemotherapy and HER2-directed agents. Purple indicates HER2; red,
luminal A; blue, luminal B; yellow, basal-like; green, normallike. All HER2 positive: HER2, 31%; luminal A, 30%; luminal B,
30%; basal-like, 6%; and normal-like, 2%. HER2 positive and
hormone receptor (HR) positive: HER2, 17%; luminal A, 34%;
luminal B, 48%; and basal-like, 1%. HER2 positive and HR negative: HER2, 51%; luminal A, 24%; luminal B, 5%; basal-like,
12%; and normal-like, 2%.

the precise mechanisms through which HER2 regulates
ER expression are not completely known. However,
increased phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
downstream of HER2 appear to be involved. Knockdown
of the PI3K substrate Akt3 reduces the expression of
HER2, increases the expression of ER, and increases sensitivity to tamoxifen.38 Thus, PI3K-Akt3 may participate in
crosstalk between HER2 and ER; these effects may be
mediated in part by reduced expression of the forkhead
box O3 (FOXO3a) transcription factor (Fig. 2).36,37,41,49
ER transcription is increased by FOXO3a in response to
lapatinib.37 Thus, increased Akt3 signaling may promote
lapatinib resistance by suppressing FOXO3a levels and
preventing ER transcription. Furthermore, FOXO3a
mediates p27 expression and the subsequent growth arrest
of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in response to lapatinib treatment.39 MAPK signaling has also been shown to
suppress ER expression in HER2-positive cells.40 Thus,
HER2 inhibition and subsequent blockade of PI3K and
MAPK may be an important mechanism through which
ER signaling is induced in response to HER2-targeted
therapies.

Figure 2. Crosstalk between the estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) pathways is
shown. In the absence of HER2 inhibition, signaling through the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway allows for the
displacement of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a) from the nucleus, resulting in (Left) inhibition of ER-regulated gene transcription.
When HER2 is inhibited by antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, decreased activity of the PI3-K pathway allows FOXO3a to
remain associated with ER, which induces ER-regulated gene transcription. This causes ER signaling to act as an escape mechanism, resulting in (Right) the development of resistance to HER2-directed agents.

Review Article

Indeed, ER signaling appears to be a major compensatory pathway driving the progression of ER-positive,
HER2-positive breast cancers treated with HER2 inhibitors (Fig. 2).36,37,41,49 For example, trastuzumab-resistant
cells demonstrate upregulation of ER-regulated genes,
including transforming growth factor-a41 and vascular endothelial growth factor.50 Furthermore, cells with
acquired lapatinib resistance demonstrate increased ER
signaling.37 Importantly, knockdown or inhibition of ER
is sufficient to promote apoptosis of lapatinib-resistant,
HER2-positive, ER-positive cells.37 In addition, the combination of estrogen deprivation and HER2-targeted therapy appears to induce complete tumor regression in
animal models of HER2-positive, ER-positive breast cancer.51 Because the inhibition of ER can induce HER2 signaling, and HER2 inhibition can increase ER expression,
both pathways should be targeted simultaneously to
achieve optimal responses in patients with ER-positive,
HER2-positive disease. Evidence of bidirectional crosstalk
and improved preclinical benefits from cotargeting ER
and HER2 suggest that the combined inhibition of ER
and HER2 may delay or prevent the development of resistance to HER2-targeted treatments.
From a clinical perspective, pCR appears to be
higher in patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive cancers when both HER2 and ER are inhibited preoperatively. In the phase 2 trial by Rimawi et al,31 which we
described earlier in the review, patients with HR-positive,
HER2-positive breast cancers were treated with preoperative trastuzumab and lapatinib to inhibit the HER2 pathway and letrozole to inhibit the ER pathway. In this trial,
the pCR rate was 21% in patients with HR-positive,
HER2-positive cancers.31 In the NeoSphere trial, the
pCR rate was only 6% in patients with HR-positive,
HER2-positive breast cancers who were treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the absence of ER inhibition.10 These data suggest that coinhibition of the ER and
HER2 pathways may be important in a subset of patients
with HR-positive, HER2-positive breast cancers, particularly when ER is the more dominant signaling pathway.
Conclusions

Patients with lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast
cancers have favorable outcomes when treated with
trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. To our knowledge, to
date the addition of other targeted agents has not been
found to improve outcomes further in the adjuvant setting. Recent data have suggested that less extensive chemotherapy may be an option for some patients, and it is
possible that chemotherapy may not be necessary in all
524

patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Given the
favorable outcome noted for patients with lymph nodenegative, small, HER2-positive cancers, it would appear
reasonable to evaluate this group of patients in future trials
evaluating an approach that does not include chemotherapy. In particular, HER2-positive cancers that express HR
are clearly different from those that are HR negative at the
molecular level, resulting in different responses to chemotherapy and HER2-directed agents. HR-positive, HER2positive breast cancers appear to be heterogeneous, with a
significant percentage having a luminal A phenotype.
Given the extensive crosstalk between the ER and HER2
pathways, the coinhibition of these pathways may be critical for a subset of patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive breast cancers. Future clinical trials could focus on the
potential omission of chemotherapy in favor of coinhibiting ER and HER2 in this subset of HER2-positive breast
cancers.
