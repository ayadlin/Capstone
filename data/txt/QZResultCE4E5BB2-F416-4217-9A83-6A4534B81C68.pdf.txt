Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an hematologic neoplasia characterized by
the accumulation of transformed immature myeloid cells in bone marrow. Although
the response rate to induction therapy is high, survival rate 5-year after diagnosis is
still low, highlighting the necessity of new novel agents. To identify agents with the
capability to abolish the self-renewal capacity of AML blasts, an in silico screening was
performed to search for small molecules that induce terminal differentiation. Emetine,
a hit compound, was validated for its anti-leukemic effect in vitro, ex vivo and in
vivo. Emetine, a second-line anti-protozoa drug, differentially reduced cell viability
and clonogenic capacity of AML primary patient samples, sparing healthy blood cells.
Emetine treatment markedly reduced AML burden in bone marrow of xenotransplanted
mice and decreased self-renewal capacity of the remaining engrafted AML cells.
Emetine also synergized with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents such as ara-C.
At a molecular level, emetine treatment was followed by a reduction in HIF-1α protein
levels. This study validated the anti-leukemic effect of emetine in AML cell lines, a
group of diverse AML primary samples, and in a human AML-transplanted murine
model, sparing healthy blood cells. The selective anti-leukemic effect of emetine
together with the safety of the dose range required to exert this effect support the
development of this agent in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION

with considerable myelotoxicity and extramedullary side
effects that may be irreversible and limit their therapeutic
potential [6]. On the other hand, the knowledge
accumulated over the past decades on the nature of
leukemic cells indicates that such cells can be converted
into non-dividing, growth arrested cells, with a decreased
sensitivity to standard chemotherapy [7]. In this regard,
it has been established that differentiation of LSCs
leads to an inhibition of self-renewal and, accordingly,
a loss of their leukemia initiation capacity [8, 9]. Thus,
differentiation therapy constitutes a promising new
approach for AML.
Using the gene expression signature associated with
vitamin D3-induced differentiation of AML cells, we have
identified Emetine as a potential anti-leukemia agent that
differentially reduces cell viability and the clonogenic
capacity of AML cells sparing healthy blood cells [8].

Although the outcome of therapy for leukemia
has improved over the years, less than a third of adults
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are cured by
current treatment, a fact strengthening the need for new
therapeutic approaches [1, 2]. The discovery of the
leukemia stem cells (LSC) as a subpopulation of leukemic
blasts with stem cell-like properties, such as self-renewal
and differentiation capacity [3, 4], established the notion
that the emergence of drug resistance and clinical relapse
following initial remission is related to the persistence of
chemotherapy-resistant LSCs [5]. Therefore, eradication
of LSCs is considered necessary for the definitive cure of
the disease.
Chemotherapy currently used for AML is composed
by the combination of conventional antineoplastic agents

RESULTS

associated to a blocking at the early S phase of DNA
replication [16]. In our system, very small differences
in the total amount of proteins in the cytoplasm or the
protein profile between vehicle- and emetine-treated
AML cells were observed (Supplementary Figure 3). The
discrepancies in the effect of emetine on the protein profile
between previous descriptions and the current analysis
can be explained by the smaller doses of this agent used
in the current study, as previous works studied emetine
mechanism using µM concentrations [14-16]. Conversely,
at the nanoMolar range, emetine has been described to
inhibit both the activation of HIF-1α by hypoxia and
iron chelator-induced HIF-1 activation [17]. AML cells
were cultured in hypoxia-like conditions and treated with
emetine. As shown in Figure 1F, HIF-1α protein level
decreased upon treatment in all AML cell lines tested.
Combination chemotherapy has been the standard of
care in cancer treatment since it is a multitargeted strategy
that might result in an increase of both response and
tolerability. Moreover, combination chemotherapy might
prevent the emergence of treatment-related mutations.
Currently, for most AML patients, frontline treatment
regimen still involves high doses of chemotherapeutics
such as the cell cycle-specific inhibitor cytarabine (ara-C)
in combination with a cell cycle-unspecific inhibitor
anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin [1]. In
order to determine the combinational effect of emetine
with currently used chemotherapeutic agents, AML cells
were treated with increasing doses of emetine combined
with ara-C. Although no effect on cell viability was
observed when 1/10 of the EC50 of either emetine or
ara-C was used, a synergistic reduction in cell number
equivalent to the EC50 was obtained when both drugs
were used simultaneously (Figure 2A). In fact, emetine
synergized with ara-C as defined by an excess over Bliss
additivism (EOBA [18]) (Figure 2B). Higher EOBA
values indicate greater synergy with the drug combination.
Interestingly, the sensitivity to emetine treatment as
measured by the EC50 is similar in ara-C-resistant HL-60
clones as compared to parental sensitive HL-60 (Figure
2C). Taken together, emetine synergized with currently
available chemotherapeutics used for AML treatment.
To further investigate the anti-leukemia effect of
emetine, primary patient AML samples from different
representative AML subtypes were tested against
increasing concentrations of emetine for 1 and 3 days ex
vivo. As shown for AML cell lines, primary AML samples
were sensitive to emetine treatment at the nanoMolar
range (Figure 3A). An optimal anti-leukemic drug for
clinical practice should target leukemic blasts without
significantly affecting normal blood cells to avoid
unwanted side effects. Thus, mature blood cells from
healthy donors were treated with emetine in the exact
same conditions, as previously described with primary
AML samples. A negligible cytotoxic effect was observed
in B, T and myeloid cells when emetine was present in

The naturally active form of vitamin D3, 1α,25(OH)2 D3, induces differentiation of normal and leukemic
myeloid cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage
[10]. This compound has a dual effect on AML cells:
inhibits cell proliferation and, simultaneously, is a very
potent inducer of cell differentiation [10]. Using public
available repositories, the gene signature associated with
vitamin D3-induced differentiation on HL-60 cell line was
obtained (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) and established
as the therapeutic target. Using the Connectivity Maps
[11], an in silico screening was performed to seek for
FDA-approved small bioactive compounds that induce a
similar gene expression pattern than our gene signature.
Emetine, a natural product alkaloid obtained from
Cephaelis ipecacuanha, displayed the highest score
(Supplementary Figure 2).
In order to study the cytotoxic effect of emetine on
AML cells, a panel of 5 AML cell lines was treated for
24 h. The EC50 obtained among these cell lines ranged
between 40 to 320 nM (Figure 1A). A concentration of
150 nM was chosen as the working EC50 for all cell lines
tested. A reduction of the cell viability was observed upon
Emetine treatment in a dose-response manner (Figure
1A) together with the induction of apoptosis, as observed
by the expression of Annexin-V (Figure 1B). The cell
cycle regulation in the presence of emetine was also
investigated and a G2/M arrest was observed as shown
in Figure 1C. The accumulation of cells in G2/M phase
was accompanied in parallel by a reduction of cells in S
phase. Thus, emetine reduced cell viability of AML cells
by inducing apoptosis and G2/M arrest.
The in silico screening was aimed to find drugs that
were able to induce differentiation together with cell death.
As described previously [12], C/EBPα is inhibited by the
fusion protein RUNX1/CBF2T1 that results in the block
of granulocytic differentiation observed in this subtype of
AML. In Kasumi-1, a RUNX1/CBF2T1 positive AML cell
line, C/EBPα mRNA expression was markedly induced
after emetine treatment (Figure 1D). Thus, the block in
myeloid differentiation is overcome upon treatment with
emetine. Similarly to C/EBPα, Spi1 (PU.1) transcriptional
factor regulates macrophage differentiation in myeloid
progenitors [13]. In the presence of emetine, Spi1 was
upregulated similarly to C/EBPα (Figure 1E). Due to the
massive cell death detected upon treatment at 24 h (Figure
1A), the evaluation of morphologic changes associated
with myeloid differentiation and/or myeloid-differentiation
associated cell surface marker expression was challenging.
Therefore, emetine not only reduced cell viability of AML
cells by inducing apoptosis but also, at least partially,
activated the myeloid differentiation transcriptional
program as predicted in the in silico screening.
Emetine was originally described as a ribosomalmediated protein [14] and DNA synthesis [15] inhibitor

the culture medium (Figure 3B). Similarly, no effect
was detected in human bone marrow hematopoietic cells
treated as described above (Supplementary Figure 4).
Taken together, emetine exerted a potent anti-leukemia
effect on primary AML patient samples from all subtypes
sparing normal blood cells, suggesting that emetine
affects selectively AML blasts without targeting normal
progenitor cells.
Due to the heterogeneous response observed
upon emetine treatment at day 1, sensitivity to emetine
was analyzed according to the prognostic cytogenetic
category of AML samples (Figure 3C) based on diagnostic
karyotype [19]. Remarkably, the unfavorable risk group
responded better to emetine treatment than favorable/
intermediate risk group as shown in Figure 3C.
The
balance
between
self-renewal
and

differentiation is tightly regulated in LSCs. Induction of
terminal differentiation results in the abrogation of the
self-renewal capacity [8]. Self-renewal potential can be
measured in vitro and ex vivo by analyzing the clonogenic
capacity in a semi-solid culture medium in the presence
of instructive cytokines. AML cell lines (Figure 4A) and
primary patient AML samples (Figure 4B) were treated
with emetine for 18h and their ability to generate blast
colonies was determined morphologically. Emetine
treatment reduced the clonogenic capacity of AML
cells by 50%. Not only the number of colonies formed
decreased upon treatment, but also the cellularity of each
colony was reduced (Figure 4C), suggesting that emetine
treatment reduced the number of colony-initiating cells but
also impaired their capacity to generate cells within the
colony.

Similarly to healthy mature blood cells, lineagedepleted umbilical cord blood cells were treated with
emetine for 18h. No significant differences were observed
in the total number of colonies or in the relative frequency
of each colony generated between vehicle-treated and
drug-treated samples, confirming the lack of myelotoxicity
on normal CB progenitors (Figure 4D).

emetine, AML-bearing immunodeficient NSG mice were

of human AML cells in the bone marrow. Mice were left
untreated 7 days after finishing the treatment regimen to
allow AML cells to regenerate the disease. This treatment

concordance with in vitro and in vivo data, a reduction
in the number of colonies formed ex vivo was observed
in human leukemia samples from emetine-treated bone
marrow cells compared to control-treated animals (Figure
5C). In fact, the colonies generated from emetine-treated
engrafted human leukemia bone marrow cells displayed a
reduced cellularity as compared to control samples (Figure
5C). Taken together, emetine reduced both leukemia
burden in vivo and the clonogenic capacity of leukemic
cells upon treatment.

human AML cells in bone marrow was severely reduced
in emetine-treated mice (Figure 5B) and the analysis was

DISCUSSION

in myeloid differentiation and the loss of clonogenic
capacity and, therefore, the lack of self-renewal activity
upon emetine treatment, indicate that the differentiation
program is activated. Additionally, apoptosis is detected
after treatment both ex vivo and in vitro. Accordingly,
emetine acts a bifunctional agent. Ideally, any therapy
against AML should be aimed at inhibiting selectively
the pivotal pathways of leukemogenesis without affecting
normal hematopoietic cells, thus neutralizing leukemic
cells and restoring normal hematopoiesis. Little effect on
healthy mature peripheral and bone marrow blood cells
was observed upon emetine treatment. Moreover, the
clonogenic capacity of hematopoietic stem cells remained
unaffected in the presence of emetine. Similarly, no bone
marrow suppression has been reported in clinical trials
where emetine has been evaluated [23], suggesting that
the anti-leukemia effect of emetine is specific.
Although HIF-1α has been involved in
hematopoietic malignancies, its specific role remains
unclear. Several studies indicated that HIF-1α is elevated
in LSCs and emerging evidence suggests that HIF-1α may
be required for survival of LSCs [24]. At a clinical level,
the expression of HIF-1α correlates with chemoresistance
and poor prognosis in AML patients [25, 26]. Interestingly,
AML samples harboring high-risk cytogenetics, associated
to poor response to state-of-the-art AML chemotherapy,
were more sensitive to emetine. Moreover, HIF-1α
promotes quiescence of leukemic cells residing in the
endosteal niches, mainly LSCs, and could contribute to
the persistence of residual leukemic cells in AML [27].
Among all the targets described for emetine, in our system
emetine seemed to decrease HIF-1α protein levels. In
concordance with previous reports studying echinomycin
[24], disruption of HIF-1α by emetine eliminated LSCs.
Due to the heterogeneity and dynamics of AML
biology, a single agent used as monotherapy is unlikely to
be capable to completely eradicate the disease. Induction
of sensitivity to chemotherapy would allow the reduction
of the effective concentration of chemotherapy and,
potentially, decrease the severity of side effects. Emetine
and ara-C synergized to induce cytotoxicity in AML cells.
In fact, the combination of 1/2 of their EC50 reduced
cell viability by 50%. Our results suggest that emetine
constitutes an AML chemosensitizer that can eliminate
LSC function, supporting further clinical investigation to
elucidate its therapeutic potential.
In conclusion, this study validated the in silico
predicted effect of emetine as a differentiating AML
agent in AML cell lines, a group of diverse AML primary
samples, and in a mouse AML-transplanted model. The
anti-leukemic effect of emetine was shown in terms
of induction of cytotoxicity and apoptosis, as well as
significant reduction of clonogenic activity, suggesting
targeting of LSCs. Moreover, the selective anti-leukemic
effect of emetine together with the safety of the dose range
required to exert this effect support the development of

Although the majority of AML patients respond
initially to induction therapy and enter remission, more
than half of these patients will experience a relapse
episode, highlighting the necessity of new novel agents
[2]. Here, an in silico screening was performed searching
for AML differentiation-inducing FDA-approved small
bioactive molecules. Emetine was identified and validated
in AML cell lines. Treatment with emetine induced
apoptosis of AML cell lines and primary samples at the
nanomolar range. The presence of emetine decreased
the clonogenic capacity of AML ex vivo. The antileukemic effect of emetine was even more pronounced
in AML samples harboring high-risk cytogenetics.
Moreover, emetine was able to reduce AML burden in
a xenotransplantation mouse model and even more the
clonogenic capacity. Taken together, our results support
further clinical studies of emetine as an anti-leukemia
novel drug in combinatory therapies and highlight the
importance of HIF-1α, emetine molecular target, in drug
resistance.
Emetine is a crystalline alkaloid derived from the
ipecac root approved for the treatment of amoebiasis
[20], although it is considered a second-line agent due
to its toxicity associated with chronic usage [21, 22].
Emetine therapeutic dose for amoebiasis treatment ranges
from 1-10 mg/kg for up to 10 days. Despite good cure
rates, its use is today restricted by the need of parenteral
(intramuscular or subcutaneous) administration and the
occurrence of adverse reactions including cardio- and
hepatotoxicity. Remarkably, significant toxicity is not
experienced with a dose of 1 mg/kg daily subcutaneously
[23]. With the emetine dose used in the in vivo experiments
shown here, of 1 mg/kg per day for 7 days, no significant
side effects were observed in treated mice compared to
the vehicle control group. According to the “Guidance for
Industry: Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in
Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy
Volunteers” published by the FDA 2005, the regimen used
in the xenotransplantation mouse model corresponds to a
0.08 mg/kg dose in humans. Therefore, the anti-leukemic
effect of emetine treatment described in this report is
achieved at a concentration below toxicity.
AML is characterized by a differentiation blockage
together with an increase in proliferation capacity.
Differentiation therapies aimed to force terminal
differentiation of AML cells that will convert AML cells
into non-dividing growth-arrested cells, more sensitive
to chemotherapeutics and with a reduced life span are
promising. The ideal drug in this context would induce
simultaneously or sequentially differentiation and
apoptosis [23]. As shown here, emetine treatment induced
apoptosis and partially differentiation, although the
latter was only detected at a gene expression regulation
level. The transcriptional activation of genes involved

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Emetine dihydrochloride hydrate and Ara-C were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Identification of genes related to myeloid
differentiation with connectivity maps

Cytotoxicity assay
7.5 x 105 cells per mL were cultured in 96-well
plates in complete medium. Emetine and Ara-C were
added at indicated concentrations. Cell viability was
measured by 7-AAD (eBioscience) exclusion and
Hoechst33342 (Sigma) positivity staining by flow
cytometry; and cell count was obtained by volume in a
FACSCantoII cytometer (BD). Statistical analysis and
EC50 determination were calculated in GraphPad (Prism
software). FlowJo software (TriStar) was used for flow
cytometry analysis.

Gene signature associated with vitamin D3-induced
differentiation in HL60 cells was obtained from GSE982
(GSM15451, GSM15452, GSM15453, GSM15576,
GSM15577, GSM15578, GSM15561, GSM15562
and GSM15563). Raw files (.cel) were normalized
and probe sets with a differential expression of at least
2-fold of change and p value < 0.005 were chosen using
GenePattern software. The 500 top-ranking downregulated
and 500 top-ranking upregulated probes during vitamin
D3 treatment were selected for in silico signature-based
screening Connectivity Maps (Supplementary Tables 1
and 2) [11].

Apoptosis analysis
MonoMac-1 and Kasumi-1 cells were treated
for 18h. Apoptosis was measured using the Annexin
V apoptosis detection kit (BD) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Data were collected by
flow cytometry (FACSCanto II, Becton-Dickinson) and
analyzed in FlowJo software (Tristar).

AML cell lines
AML cell lines HL-60 (ACC-3) [28], KG-1 (ACC14) [29], MonoMac-1 (ACC-252) [30], Kasumi-1 (ACC220) [31] and THP-1 (ACC-16) [32] were obtained
from DSMZ (Germany). Cell lines were used within
the first 6 months after resuscitation from reception or
resuscitation from the DSMZ cell repository where they
were genotypically characterized. Chemotherapy-resistant
cells are HL-60 derived lines whose characteristics are
summarized in Supplementary Figure 1.

Cell cycle analysis
5 x 105 cells per mL were cultured in 96-well plates
in complete medium. 24h after treatment, cells were
harvested, washed, and fixed and permeabilized in 70%
ethanol (Sigma) at 4ºC. DNA content was stained with
7-AAD (eBioscience) and measured by flow cytometry
(FACSVerse and FACSCantoII, BD).

Primary samples
Primary AML samples were obtained from
patients diagnosed with AML at Hospital Clínic of
Barcelona (Spain). AML diagnosis and classification was
based on accepted WHO criteria. Main AML patient’s
characteristics are summarized in Supplementary
Table 3. Samples were obtained from bone marrow and
mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated by Ficoll density
gradient centrifugation (GE). All patients provided written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki, and the study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Hospital Clínic of Barcelona. Blood
mature MNCs were isolated from healthy-donor buffy
coats provided by Banc de Sang i Teixits (Barcelona,
Spain). Umbilical cord blood MNCs were obtained after
Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were depleted
for lineage marker-positive cells using magnetic beads
(Milteny biotech).

Real time PCR
RNA was isolated using the Total RNA purification
kit (Norgen biotek) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and reverse transcriptase PCR was
performed using the qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta
Biosciences). Quantitative PCR was performed using
a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) with a Power SYBR Green PCR mastermix
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and using specific primers for each gene
(summarized in Supplementary table 4). GAPDH
expression was used as control.

Western blot
HL-60 and KG-1 cells (10 x 106 cells) were
incubated with the indicated compounds for 24 h. Cells
were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer. The protein
extract was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (BioRad)
electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (BioRad). Mouse anti-human HIF-1α and
goat anti-β-actin antibodies were purchased from BD and
Abcam respectively.

In vivo studies
NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG, Jackson
Laboratories) mice were myeloablated by busulfan (3 mg/
kg IP) at day -1. At day 0, 10 million HL-60 cells were
injected IV and left untreated for one week. From day 7
to day 14, 8 mice were treated daily with emetine (1 mg/
kg IP), while the other 9 mice were treated with saline
vehicle. At day 21, mice were sacrificed and their bones
(iliac crests, femurs and tibias) were harvested. Cells for
cytometric analysis were stained with Hoechst 33342
and PE-Cy7 Anti-Human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) and
