ABSTRACT
An abnormal expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) has
been described in many tumors. PARP-1 promotes tumorigenesis and cancer
progression by acting on different molecular pathways. PARP-1 inhibitors can be
used with radiotherapy or chemotherapy to enhance the susceptibility of tumor
cells to the treatment. However, the specific mechanism of PARP-1 in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) remains unknown. Our study showed that expression of PARP-1
was upregulated in AML patients. PARP-1 inhibition slowed AML cell proliferation,
arrested the cell cycle, induced apoptosis in vitro and improved AML prognosis in
vivo. Mechanistically, microarray assay of AML cells with loss of PARP-1 function
revealed that the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) was significantly
downregulated. In human AML samples, MPL expression was increased, and gainof-function and loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that MPL promoted cell
growth. Moreover, PARP-1 and MPL expression were positively correlated in AML
samples, and their overexpression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
Furthermore, PARP-1 and MPL consistently acted on Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, and
the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic function observed with PARP-1 inhibition
were reversed in part via MPL activation upon thrombopoietin stimulation or gene
overexpression. These data highlight the important function of PARP-1 in the
progression of AML, which suggest PARP-1 as a potential target for AML treatment.

great improvements have been made in targeted therapies,
many AML patients tend to have a poor prognosis because
of marked heterogeneity of leukemic cells. There is an
urgent need for the identification of new biomarkers and
molecular mechanisms involved in AML progression for
both fundamental research and clinical treatments.
PARP-1 is a nuclear protein, mainly known for
DNA repair by catalyzing poly ADP-ribosylation of itself
and other chromatin-associated proteins [2]. Besides,
PARP-1 is implicated in a broad variety of cellular
functions, including gene transcriptional regulation, cell
cycle progression, inflammation, energy metabolism, cell

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder
of the hematopoietic system and is characterized by
malignant proliferation, differentiation blockage, and
unregulated apoptosis of hematopoietic stem progenitor
cells (HSPCs). The incidence of AML is increasing
worldwide while its etiology is still unclear. Increasing
genetic and molecular abnormities have been proven
to contribute to carcinogenesis, so diagnosis, risk
stratification, and treatments targeting aberrant molecules
and pathways are of clinical importance [1]. Although

proliferation and death [3–5]. In recent years, PARP-1
has been found to be highly expressed in breast cancer
[6], hepatocellular carcinoma [7], and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma [8]. Moreover, its overexpression inversely
correlates with the prognosis [9, 10]. Mechanistically,
PARP-1 decreases sodium iodide symporter mRNA
levels by changing its epigenetic status in thyroid cancer
cells [11]. Furthermore, PARP-1 up-regulates vimentin
expression in aggressive metastatic melanomas, promoting
an endothelial to mesenchymal transition, tumor
angiogenesis, and distant metastases [12]. Additionally,
PARP-1 overexpression inhibits the recruitment of
death-inducing signaling complex in pancreatic cancer
cells, offering the ability to resist TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) therapy [13]. It is now widely
accepted that PARP-1 functions as an oncogene; however,
its specific role in AML and precise molecular mechanisms
have not been clarified.
The myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene
(MPL) encodes the 635 amino acid CD110 protein,
which consists of four functional domains and belongs
to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily [14]. Its ligand
thrombopoietin (TPO) supports hematopoietic stem cell
maintenance and proliferation as well as megakaryopoiesis
[15]. Mutations in MPL or its secondary signaling proteins
result in hyperproliferation of numerous cell lineages,
causing hematopoietic diseases [16]. In AML, more specific
signaling pathways related to MPL remain to be discovered.
In this study, we clarified the anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effects of PARP-1 inhibition in AML. As
a monotherapy, PARP-1 inhibition alleviated the disease
progression and prolonged survival in a mouse model of
AML. Moreover, RNA microarrays of loss of PARP-1
function identified a significant downregulation of MPL.
Further investigations revealed a significant positive
correlation between PARP-1 and MPL overexpression in
AML samples. Both PARP-1 and MPL overexpression
was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Finally,
phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 suggest that PARP-1
may be involved in these signaling pathways.

cells was 23.5 ± 3.9 and 35.6 ± 5.5 μM, respectively. To
ensure the specificity of the inhibition, we verified the
growth inhibition effect on AML cell lines by PARP1 gene interference (Supplementary Fig. 1). The results
were consistent with those obtained with PARP-1 inhibitor
PJ34. In exploring the underlying mechanism of PARP-1
inhibition in AML cells, we found a significantly higher
number of cells arrested in the G2/M cell-cycle phase, and
a decreased number of cells in the G0/G1 and S phases,
with PARP-1 inhibition than without (Fig. 1C, 1D).
Analysis of cell-cycle regulatory proteins showed
decreased cyclin B1 and CDK1 levels accompanied by
an increased P27 level in this process (Fig. 1E, 1F). As
well, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining revealed an increased
apoptosis of AML cells while increasing PARP-1
inhibition (Fig. 2A, 2B), which was further confirmed by
lower levels of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
(Fig. 2C, 2D). These alterations might act on the Akt
and ERK1/2 pathways because p-Akt and p-ERK levels
were downregulated (Fig. 2C, 2D). Therefore, PARP-1
inhibition effect on AML cells is the result of both cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.

PARP-1 inhibition significantly relieves leukemia
progression in AML mice
To test the function of PARP-1 in tumor progression
in vivo, we used an AML murine model injected with
C1498-GFP cells that were selected and maintained by
puromycin and detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A).
In this AML murine model, PARP-1 was inhibited by
PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 because of a reduced level of
its enzymatic product, PAR (Fig. 3B). As expected,
emaciation and weight loss were less severe with PJ34
than with saline injection (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C, 3D), and
the median survival of AML mice treated with PARP-1
inhibitor PJ34 was prolonged as compared to control mice
(37.5 vs. 23.5 days, P < 0.01; Fig. 3E).
The tumor burden was evaluated by organomegaly
and tumor cell infiltration. Our results show that
PARP-1 inhibition alleviated AML hepatomegaly and
splenomegaly (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, the proportion
of GFP-positive cells in the blood and liver tissues
were significantly reduced with PARP-1 inhibition
(Fig. 3F, 3G). Moreover, the number of leukemia cells
was reduced in the liver (Fig. 3H). Therefore, PARP-1
inhibition alleviated AML tumor load in vivo in mice and
prolonged their survival.

RESULTS
PARP-1 inhibition suppresses AML cell
proliferation
In this study, we first detected the expression of
PARP-1 in BM mononuclear cells from 30 AML patients,
with 15 healthy donors as controls. PARP-1 expression
was significantly increased in AML samples as compared
to controls (P < 0.01; Fig. 1A).
We determined the role of PARP-1 on growth of
Kasumi-1 and THP-1 AML cell lines by CCK8 assay.

with ≥ 0.5-fold downregulation (Table 2) in 3 independent
experiments (P < 0.01). To verify the microarray analysis
data, we examined 5 differentially expressed genes that
are involved in leukemia [17–21]. Similar results in gene
expression were observed by qRT-PCR and microarray
analysis with PARP-1 inhibition (P > 0.05; Fig. 4B). To
understand some important biological processes affected
by PARP-1 in AML cells, a GO analysis was performed
and revealed PARP-1 roles in apoptosis, proliferation,
cell cycle, cell differentiation, adhesion, migration, and

angiogenesis (Fig. 4C). Pathway analysis with the KEGG
database further classified the functional annotations
of genes and revealed upregulated and downregulated
genes significantly enriched in 86 pathways (15 top
enrichment pathways are shown in Fig. 4D). Because
microarrays showed a significant downregulation of the
TPO receptor MPL with PARP-1 inhibition and MPL
takes part in the biological behavior of leukemogenesis
and chemoresistance [22–24], we focused on PARP-1 and
MPL.

be involved in this mechanism, including Akt and MAPK
pathways. MPL knockdown notably decreased p-Akt and
p-ERK levels (Fig. 5D, 5E) in both cell lines; however,
no change in p-JNK and p-P38 levels was observed
(Fig. 5D, 5E).

MPL is present on HSPCs, megakaryocytes, and
thrombocytes [25–27]. To further clarify its role in AML,
we first detected MPL mRNA in AML patient primary BM
cells. MPL was significantly upregulated in AML samples
compared to healthy control samples (P < 0.01; Fig. 5A).
Further functional studies in Kasumi-1 and THP-1 AML
cell lines of MPL knockdown or overexpression (Fig. 5B)
showed a reduced or accelerated proliferation, respectively
(P < 0.01; Fig. 5C). Therefore, MPL promotes AML
cell malignant proliferation. Because MPL knockdown
suppressed cell growth, we studied pathways that might

PARP-1 inhibition protects against AML by

According to our microarray results, MPL might be
downstream of PARP-1. We compared MPL and PARP-1
expression in patient BM samples and we found that their
expression positively correlated (P < 0.01; Fig. 6A). PARP-1
inhibition significantly inhibited PAR formation (Fig. 6B)

and reduced the expression level of MPL (Fig. 6B, 6C).
Further validation by PARP-1 knockdown (Fig. 6D–6F)
showed that MPL protein levels were decreased (Fig. 6E,
6F). Therefore, PARP-1 may directly act on MPL expression.
To further determine whether MPL was functional
downstream of PARP-1, MPL was physiologically
activated by its ligand TPO or overexpressed by lentiviral
transduction. TPO increased the proliferation of Kasumi-1
and THP-1 cells, as did MPL overexpression (P < 0.05
and P < 0.01 respectively; Fig. 7A). On the other hand,
PARP-1 inhibition decreased cell viability (P < 0.01;
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Fig. 7A); however, the effect of PARP-1 inhibition
diminished significantly when MPL was activated by
TPO in Kasumi-1 and THP-1 cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01
respectively; Fig. 7A). Growth inhibition due to PARP-1
inhibition was rescued when both Kasumi-1 and THP-1
cells overexpressed MPL (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05; Fig. 7B).
Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells was reduced
significantly (Fig. 7C, 7D), effectively showing the opposite
effects induced by MPL activation and PARP-1 inhibition.
Therefore, PARP-1 may act on AML cells by regulating
its downstream functional MPL gene directly or indirectly.

DISCUSSION

which PARP-1 aggravates the pathogenesis of AML is still
unclear. In the current study, we focused on the function
of PARP-1 and its potential downstream molecule MPL,
which was revealed by microarray analysis. PARP-1
inhibition suppressed the proliferation, arrested the cell
cycle, and induced apoptosis of AML cells in vitro and
alleviated disease progression and prolonged survival

Emerging evidence show that PARP-1 participates
in a broad variety of cellular biological processes, such
as transcriptional regulation [4] and tumor angiogenesis
[28], independently of its classical DNA damage repair
function. So far, the precise signaling mechanism by

in mice in vivo. Both PARP-1 and MPL expression
were upregulated in BM of AML patients, with a
significant positive correlation. MPL supported AML cell
proliferation, and activation or overexpression of MPL
partly reversed PARP-1 inhibition effect.
One of the distinguishing features of malignant
tumor cells is infinite proliferation. The rapid replication
and division of tumor cells is inevitably accompanied
by increasing DNA damage. PARP-1, a nuclear protein
involved in DNA repair, is usually overexpressed in tumor
tissue [6–8, 29, 30]. Here, we confirmed that PARP-1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression is higher in BM from AML patients than from
healthy individuals. However, its expression did not differ
among different subtypes of AML according to the French–
American–British (FAB) classification (data not shown).
It has been previously reported that PARP-1 supports
tumor cell growth, and inhibitors of PARP-1 show
potent antiproliferative and proapoptoic effects, holding
promise for tumor therapy [8, 11, 13, 31]. In this study,
both PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 treatment and PARP-1
knockdown induced significant suppression of AML cell
growth. Cell proliferation is dependent on the cell cycle

proceeding, which is highly ordered and tightly regulated
by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK
inhibitors (CKIs) [32]. Indeed, PARP-1 inhibition induced
a significant G2/M cell cycle arrest, and downregulation
of both cyclin B1 and CDK1, whereas CKI P27 was
upregulated. In addition, abnormal activation of the Akt
and ERK1/2 pathways promotes survival and suppresses
apoptosis of leukemic cells, which could be effective
therapeutic targets [33, 34]. Here, we observed that
PARP-1 inhibition decreased the phosphorylation of both
Akt and ERK in AML Kasumi-1 and THP-1 cells, which
led to an increased in cell apoptosis. Further evidence
was the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL reduced levels.
PARP-1 deficiency or inhibition can have a beneficial
outcome in tumor treatment [35, 36]. Accordingly, we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studied an AML murine model that allowed us to evaluate
PARP-1 effect on AML infiltration and disease progression
by monitoring C1498-GFP cells in vivo. As compared
with controls, PARP-1 inhibition indeed alleviated the
disease progression, including decreasing cell infiltration,
hepatosplenomegaly, and prolonging survival, for further
evidence of PARP-1 inhibition potentiality in tumor
therapy. Of note, we confirmed PARP-1 overexpression
in AML, promoting cell survival and AML progression.
In discussing the role of PARP-1 in tumors,
almost exclusive focus is given to its DNA repair
activity, including PARP-1-dependent base excision
repair pathways and synthetic lethality of homologous
repair-deficient (e.g., BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient)
tumors [37]. Recently, more efforts are being made to

identify its roles in modulating chromatin structure,
regulation of gene transcription and protein stability
[4, 38], participating in the inflammatory response,
immunologic process, vascular plasticity and metastasis,
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [12, 39–
41]. Therefore, we performed a transcriptome analysis
to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.
Differentially expressed genes with PARP-1 inhibition
were mainly enriched in regulation of transcription,
metabolic process, cell proliferation, apoptotic process,
and phosphorylation, which supports PARP-1 function
in inflammation, tumor, and metabolic disorders. These
results provide a better understanding of some tumorrelated genes regulated by PARP-1. Martínez-Bosch
and colleagues proved that PARP-1 upregulates MDM2,
VEGFR1, and MMP28, accelerating tumor proliferation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer [42]. Moreover,
PARP-1 participates in the regulation of c-myc gene
expression. Because c-myc regulates 10 to 15% of human
genes, this interaction may be the basis of the pleiotropic
physiological behavior of PARP-1 [43]. In our study, we
tested several dysregulated genes associated with leukemia
by microarray data analysis, including MPL, GADD45g,
TOB1, SLA, and ETS1, and mainly focused on MPL,
which was reduced by PARP-1 inhibition.
As the receptor of TPO, MPL is mainly expressed
on the membrane of HSPCs, megakaryocytes, and
thrombocytes. Physiologically, MPL plays an important
role in the proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs and
megakaryocytes, and in the maintenance of an appropriate
number of platelets [44]. However, excessive activation
of the TPO/MPL pathway is involved in leukemogenesis
27499

[45] as well as in chemotherapy resistance [24]. Recent
studies showed that TPO/MPL/Bcl-xL or TPO/MPL/PI3K/
Akt signaling pathways are essential for maintaining AML
driven by AML1-ETO [22, 23]. Here, we demonstrate that
MPL was highly expressed in clinical AML specimens,
as previously described [46, 47]. In addition, PARP-1
and MPL expression were positively correlated in
our clinical samples, which further suggest MPL as
an important intermediary of PARP-1-mediated AML
progress. This hypothesis was verified by activation of
MPL, upon stimulation by its ligand TPO or lentivirusmediated overexpression, where PARP-1 function was
hindered. Accordingly, functional studies showed that the
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic function of PARP-1
inhibition was partly reversed by MPL activation. These
data suggested that PARP-1 takes effect at least in part
by its ability to activate MPL. Nevertheless, the direct or
indirect relationship between PARP-1 and MPL remains to
be elucidated. MPL is well accepted as an oncogene, and
gain-of-function or loss-of-function of MPL specifically
showed significant growth promotion or inhibition,
respectively. TPO is the classical ligand of MPL, activating
its downstream molecular pathways, including PI3K/Akt
and MAPK pathways [48, 49]. Our study revealed that
Akt, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 pathways were constitutively
activated in AML; however, MPL knockdown inhibited
only p-Akt and p-ERK levels, perhaps because of different
biological characteristics of various cell types.
Currently, more and more gene mutations,
aberrantly expressed genes, and microRNAs are identified
in AML [50]. On one hand, these molecular disorders can
be potential prognostic markers of risk stratification and
choice of therapeutic regimens; and on the other hand, they

may be effective targets for clinical treatment. In previous
reports, PARP-1 is statistically considered as a prognostic
marker in solid tumors, where high expression of PARP-1
associated with the worse outcomes [9, 10, 51]. We
analyzed the relation between chemotherapeutic response
of AML patients and initial PARP-1 expression. The results
revealed that patients with high PARP-1 expression levels
associated with a refractory response or died in a short time
(Supplementary Fig. 2). From these refractory patients also
emerged an overexpression of MPL, verifying its role of
adverse prognostic factor [52]. Since chemotherapies
remain the primary therapy for AML treatment; however
generating more DNA damage, which can further activate
PARP-1, and contributing to chemotherapy resistance.
Inhibition of PARP-1 became important to oncotherapy.
In recent years, encouraging results have been achieved
by PARP-1 inhibitors in treating BRCA 1/2-related breast
and ovarian cancers [53, 54], and here we observed that
a PARP-1 inhibitor also alleviates AML tumor load and
prolongs survival in mice. Additional studies are required
to uncover the specific impact of PARP-1 on diagnosis,
therapy, and prognosis.
Taken together, PARP-1 overexpression in AML
possibly caused by DNA damage which were associated
with excessive division and proliferation of tumor cells may
activate MPL. Furthermore, Akt and ERK1/2 pathways
were highly activated, endowing malignant cells with the
ability of aberrant proliferation and escaping apoptosis
(Fig. 8). Understanding this pathway provides important
molecular insights into the underlying mechanisms of
PARP-1 in AML. More in-depth investigations are needed
to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which PARP-1
regulates downstream molecules.

Figure. 8: Schematic representation of the role of PARP-1 in the regulation of AML cell survival and proliferation. PARP-1
is overexpressed in AML, which may be caused by DNA damage when excessive division and proliferation of tumor cells. As a transcriptional
coregulator, PARP-1 upregulates MPL expression by polyADP-ribosylation, which further activates Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, and allows
malignant cells to unlimited proliferation and escaping apoptosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

weeks. Mice were observed closely for occurrence and
development of disease. Blood was drawn from the
venae angularis and resuspended in red blood cell lysis
buffer to remove erythrocytes. The remaining cells were
used to analyze GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry.
Moreover, liver tissues were mechanically dissociated
into a monoplast suspension for detection of leukemic
cell infiltration by flow cytometry. Paraffinized sections
of liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining. All experimental procedures were performed
in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals published by the US National
Institutes of Health and Shandong University.

Reagents
PARP-1 inhibitor (PJ34) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and TPO was
purchased from 3SBIO (Shenyang, China). Primary
antibodies for PARP-1 and β-actin were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and
for anti-poly(ADP-Ribose) (PAR) from BD Biosciences
(NJ, USA). Antibodies against MPL was obtained from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) and phosphorylated
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK)/ERK,
p-P38/P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/JNK and p-Akt/Akt
were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA).

Microarray analysis
C1498 cells were treated with PARP-1 inhibitor
or PBS, and total RNA was extracted for microarray
assay. Differentially expressed genes were detected with
the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array
(Affymetrix, CA, USA), and GO-Analysis and PathwayAnalysis was performed by Gminix (Shanghai). GEO
accession number: GSE64220, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=orezmycgvjqvpox&acc=G
SE64220

Cell lines
The C1498 murine AML cell line (ATCC) was
cultured in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY,
USA). C1498-GFP cells were produced by retroviral
transduction and selected with puromycin (6 μg/mL) for
2 weeks. THP-1 and Kasumi-1 (Shanghai Institutes for
Biological Sciences, China) cell lines that were derived
from AML patients were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were maintained in
a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Proliferation assay
The cell viability of treated cells was evaluated by
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; DOJINDO, Japan). Briefly,
cells were cultured in 96-well plates, seeded at 3–5 × 103
per well. The CCK8 solution (10 μL) was added to each
well and incubated at 37°C for 1 to 4 h. Absorbance was
measured on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 450 nm.
Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.

Patient samples
Bone marrow (BM) was collected from AML patients
with a blast cell median of 75% (28–99%) among leucocytes
and from healthy donors at Qilu Hospital, Shandong
University. Mononuclear cells were obtained from BM by
density-gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Hypaque (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A written informed consent
was obtained from all donors, and study protocols were
approved by the medical ethics committee of the Affiliated
Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Jinan, China).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was analyzed with FITC Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA).
Cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 100 μL
binding buffer, labeled with 5 μL Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL
PI, and incubated for 15 min in the dark. The binding buffer
(400 μL) was added and the fluorescence was detected on a
FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA).

Animal model and treatment

Cell cycle analysis

C57BL/6J male mice, from Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME, USA), were housed in a specific pathogenfree animal care facility under a constant temperature
(24°C) and regular light-dark cycles. Mice were given
a normal diet and free access to water. C1498-GFP
cells (1 × 106)were resuspended in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS; 100 μL) and injected into 6–8 weeks old
mice via the tail vein. Experimental and control mice
were intraperitoneally injected with PARP-1 inhibitor
(10 mg/kg) or normal saline (NS) once a day for four
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells treated with 10 μM PARP-1 inhibitor for
24  h were harvested, fixed in ice-cold 75% ethanol at
4°C for 2 h, resuspended in PBS to rehydrate for 15 min,
and collected and resuspended in DNA staining solution
(MultiSciences Biotech, Hangzhou, China) for 30 min at
room temperature. DNA content was analyzed in triplicate
on FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA). Cell
cycle distribution was analyzed with the ModFit LT 3.1
software (Verity Software House, ME, USA).
