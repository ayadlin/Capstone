BACKGROUND: Dose intensification of chemotherapy has improved outcome for younger adults with de
novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Novel formulations of standard chemotherapy agents may further reduce the incidence of disease recurrence after frontline chemotherapy. Vincristine (VCR) sulfate liposomes injection (VSLI) is a sphingomyelin/cholesterol nanoparticle encapsulated VCR formulation that
improves the pharmacokinetic profile of VCR without augmenting neurotoxicity. METHODS: A phase 1 trial
of weekly, intravenous VSLI at 1.5 mg/m2, 1.825 mg/m2, 2.0 mg/m2, 2.25 mg/m2, or 2.4 mg/m2 was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a standard, 3 þ 3 dose-escalation design.
Dexamethasone (40 mg) was given on Days 1 through 4 and on Days 11 through 14 of each 4-week cycle.
RESULTS: Thirty-six adults with relapsed/refractory ALL, all previously treated with conventional VCR,
received at least 1 dose of VSLI. The MTD of VSLI was 2.25 mg/m2 based on dose-limiting toxicities of
grade 3 motor neuropathy, grade 4 seizure, and grade 4 hepatotoxicity in 1 patient each at the 2.4 mg/m2
dose level. The most common toxicities attributed to VSLI included peripheral neuropathy (55%) and constipation (53%). A complete response (CR) was achieved in 7 of 36 patients (19%) based on an intent-totreat analysis; the CR rate was 29% for the 14 patients who underwent therapy as their first salvage
attempt. Four of 7 patients who achieved a CR underwent subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation
in remission. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, VSLI plus dexamethasone appeared to be an effective salvage
therapy option for relapsed/refractory ALL. A phase 2, international, multicenter clinical trial assessing the
efficacy of single-agent VSLI as second salvage therapy for patients with previously treated ALL is underC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Liposomal Vincristine in ALL/Thomas et al

Significant improvements in outcome are being
achieved in younger adults with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the use of dose-intensive
treatment programs modeled after pediatric regimens;
long-term event-free survival (EFS) rates range from
60% to 70% compared with 30% to 40% after conventional adult chemotherapy.1 This is attributed in part
to higher dose intensity (and cumulative dose) of the
anthracycline, vincristine (VCR), corticosteroids, and
asparaginase components.
Novel formulations of standard chemotherapy
agents that improve drug delivery without additional toxicity also may reduce the incidence of disease recurrence
after frontline chemotherapy. The vinca alkaloid VCR has
significant activity against aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes and ALL, and it remains an integral component of chemotherapy regimens for these
disease entities. VCR induces cell cycle-specific cytotoxicity by binding to tubulin during active mitosis, resulting
in microtubule depolymerization and metaphase arrest.2,3
This, in turn, leads to apoptosis. In human leukemia cell
lines, the degree of VCR-induced apoptosis in vitro
increased proportionally with higher drug concentrations
and longer duration of exposure. After intravenous
administration, conventional VCR undergoes rapid cellular uptake and extensive tissue binding, resulting in a halflife on the order of minutes with low levels of free VCR in
the plasma.4-6 Furthermore, the dose intensity and delivery of conventional VCR is limited by the significant peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) neurotoxicity,
which ensues at doses higher than 1.4 mg/m2 or at a
‘‘capped’’ dose of 2 mg.7-9
VCR sulfate liposomes injection (VSLI) (Marqibo;
developed by Inex Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada and Enzon Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Bridgewater, NJ) is a novel
nanoparticle formulation of VCR encapsulated in the
aqueous core of sphingomyelin and cholesterol liposomes
called Optisomes. The encapsulation of VCR prolongs
the circulation of active drug and passively targets drug to
tissues with fenestrated vasculature (eg, bone marrow,
lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and solid tumors), thereafter
leading to first-order release kinetics with deposition of
drug over several days.10-12 VSLI has demonstrated significantly greater antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo in
animal models compared with conventional VCR at

equivalent (mg/kg) doses, and was more likely to be curative in murine systems against L1210 or P388 leukemia
cell lines.13-16
A phase 1 clinical trial of single-agent VSLI was initially conducted in patients who had previously treated
solid tumors. VSLI was dose escalated from 0.5 mg/m2 to
2.8 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.17 Dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs) were observed at the 2.8 mg/m2 dose level and
included myalgias, peripheral neuropathy, and constipation. It was determined that the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was 2.4 mg/m2, although toxicity profiles were
similar at the 2 mg/m2 and 2.4 mg/m2 dose levels. The
most frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities observed over all
dose levels were constipation (12%), fatigue (8%), alopecia (8%), and anemia (8%).
Next, a pivotal phase 2 study of VSLI was conducted
among patients with recurrent, aggressive NHL using a
dosing schema of 2 mg/m2 every other week.18 After tolerability was established, the trial was extended to patients
with relapsed or refractory ALL. Sixteen heavily pretreated,
refractory patients (including 50% with Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positive ALL in the preimatinib era) received
therapy with single-agent VSLI.19 The overall response rate
in that group was 15%: There were 2 responders (1 complete remission [CR], 1 partial response [PR]), 4 patients
had transient bone marrow cytoreduction. Neurotoxicity
was minimal, but dosing was limited. To further optimize
dose intensity and to discern the tolerance of multiple doses
in the salvage setting, a multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of
weekly dose-escalated VSLI was designed20 in which
patients received VSLI concurrently with pulse dexamethasone to facilitate multiple dosing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients who had previously treated ALL, including the
lymphoblastic lymphoma and Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma (BLL) subtypes, were eligible if they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
3, if they had total bilirubin and creatinine levels 2
times the upper limit of normal, and if serious active
infections were controlled. At least 21 days must have
elapsed since the previous antileukemia therapy except in
patients who had rapidly progressive disease if they had

recovered from previous toxicity. Previous stem cell transplantation (SCT) was allowed as long as the other eligibility criteria were met. Patients could not have known CNS
disease that required active intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy
or craniospinal radiation therapy, although asymptomatic, controlled CNS disease was allowed. Patients were
also excluded on the basis of other neurologic criteria,
including a history of grade 3/4 sensory or motor neuropathy with previous chemotherapy, persistent grade 2
active neuropathy, or active neurologic disorders unrelated to chemotherapy (eg, familial neurologic disorders
or acquired demyelinating disorders). Pregnant women
were not eligible. The protocol was reviewed by the institutional review boards of the respective institutions.
Informed consent was obtained from patients in accordance with institutional guidelines and the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Therapy
VSLI with a final VCR concentration of 0.16 mg/mL was
reconstituted from a single-use, 3-vial kit (Almac, Durham, NC) and administered within 12 hours of preparation. VSLI was administered on a weekly basis as an
intravenous infusion (either peripherally or through a central venous catheter) over 60 minutes at a dose of 1.5 mg/
m2, 1.825 mg/m2, 2 mg/m2, 2.25 mg/m2, or 2.4 mg/m2
(no dose capping) concurrently with dexamethasone 40
mg intravenously or orally on Days 1 through 4 and Days
11 through 14 of each 4-week cycle. Therapy was continued thereafter in the absence of DLTs or disease progression for up to 12 cycles of therapy. Prophylactic therapy
with stool softeners was strongly encouraged. The use of
neurotropic agents, such as gabapentin and/or amytriptyline, was permitted for the management of peripheral
neuropathy. Dose reductions and/or dose delays of the
VSLI were implemented with subsequent cycles of therapy as indicated for persistent grade 2 or 3 VSLI-related
nonhematologic toxicities (eg, peripheral neuropathy or
constipation). Dose modifications were not required for
medically manageable grade 3 toxicities (eg, fever without
infection or emesis). If a grade 4 VSLI-related nonhematologic toxicity other than hyperglycemia was encountered (exclusive of expected toxicities, such as sepsis or
other events related to underlying disease), then therapy
was permanently discontinued. Hyperglycemia of any
5492

grade and other toxicities related to the dexamethasone
were managed according to standard practice without
dose modifications of the VSLI.

Assessments
Pretreatment evaluations included a history and physical
examination with neurologic assessment; complete blood
count with differential; chemistry profile, including hepatic and renal function tests; pregnancy test for women
of childbearing potential; bone marrow aspiration; and radiographs of involved sites if the patient had known extramedullary disease. Laboratory parameters and neurologic
examinations were repeated at least weekly during the first
cycle of therapy before each dose of VSLI. Bone marrow
aspirations were obtained on Days 14 and 28 of the first
cycle of therapy and as warranted thereafter to assess disease status. Abnormal radiographs of involved sites were
repeated at the end of the first cycle to assess response.

Supportive Care
Appropriate transfusion support was provided with
packed erythrocytes given for symptomatic and/or severe
anemia, and platelets (PLTs) were given for thrombocytopenia according to institutional guidelines. All blood
products were irradiated as feasible. Prophylactic antibiotics were encouraged during periods of neutropenia,
including antibacterial agents (eg, quinolones), triazole
antifungal agents (such as fluconazole, itraconazole, or
voriconazole), and antiviral agents, such as acyclovir or
valcyclovir. Filgastrim was not administered routinely but
was permitted in patients who had infections associated
with neutropenia.

Response Criteria
A CR included normocellular or hypercellular bone marrow with <5% blasts, a granulocyte count (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]) 1  109/L, and a PLT count
100  109/L. Resolution of extramedullary disease was
required for CR. A PR was defined as normalization of
the peripheral blood, similar to a CR with residual bone
marrow blasts from 6% to 25%. Hematologic improvements (HIs) in cytopenias and/or bone marrow disease
compared with pretreatment parameters also were

categorized as measures of clinical benefit: improvements
in 1) ANC by 50% and to >1  109/L (HI-ANC) if it
was below that level, 2) hemoglobin by 2 g/dL if <10 g/
dL or a decrease in transfusion requirements by 50%
(HI-HGB), 3) PLTs by 50% and to 50  109/L if it was
below that level or the achievement of transfusion-independence (HI-PLT), and 4) a reduction in bone marrow
blasts to 5% (HI-BM). Patients who failed to meet any
of these criteria or who had evidence of disease progression were considered nonresponders.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the
MTD of 4 weekly doses of VSLI administered concurrently
with pulse dexamethasone (1 cycle). All patients who
received at least 1 dose of VSLI were evaluable for toxicity;
however, patients who did not complete 1 full cycle for reasons other than DLT were not evaluable for the MTD.
Such patients were replaced until the cohort was completed.
A traditional 3 þ 3 phase 1 design was used to determine
the feasibility of dose escalation. Once the MTD was established, up to 10 additional patients could be enrolled at
that dose level to better characterize the toxicity profile. Secondary objectives of the study included assessments of efficacy as measured by the proportion of patients who
achieved a CR or a PR in an intent-to-treat analysis.
Response rates were reported with a 2-sided confidence
interval (CI) using the exact method.21 Toxicity was
assessed according to the National Cancer Institute
Expanded Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3; National
Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md). Differences in response
rates or pretreatment characteristics among subgroups were
analyzed using the chi-square test or the Fischer exact test.21

RESULTS
Study Group
Between August 2002 and July 2006, 36 adults with previously treated recurrent or refractory ALL or BLL were enrolled (Table 1). The median age of the group was 32 years;
3 patients (8%) were aged 60 years, and 67% of patients
were men. Three patients had extramedullary disease
(peripheral lymphadenopathy, mediastinal mass, and intraabdominal adenopathy), and none had known CNS disease

was 12 months (range, 2-83 months). Seven patients (19%)
were refractory to initial induction chemotherapy. Six
patients (17%) had undergone allogeneic SCT as consolidation therapy (n ¼ 5) or salvage therapy (n ¼ 1). All patients
had previously received conventional VCR. One patient
with Ph-positive ALL also had failed tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based therapy. The median time from initial diagnosis
to therapy with VSLI and dexamethasone was 16 months
(range, 3-102 months). VSLI-based therapy was the first salvage attempt in 14 patients (39%), the second salvage
attempt in 14 patients (39%), and the third or greater salvage attempt in 8 patients (22%).

(36% at 3 dose levels between 1.5 mg/m2 and 2 mg/m2 vs
60% at 2 dose levels between 2.25 mg/m2 and 2.4 mg/
m2). Grade 3 and 4 clinically relevant toxicity was not
observed until the 2.25 mg/m2 dose level was reached (Table 2). Three DLTs with at least possible or probable attribution to VSLI were observed at the 2.4 mg/m2 dose level
in 1 patient each, and included grade 3 motor neuropathy
(probable), grade 4 seizure in the setting of intracranial
hemorrhage (possible), and grade 4 hepatotoxicity (elevations in hepatic transaminase levels with the inability to
exclude a possible drug-drug interaction with fluconazole).
Grade 4 hyperglycemia also was observed in the patient
with hepatotoxicity and was attributed to the dexamethasone. The MTD was established at 2.25 mg/m2. An additional 11 patients (1 who was replaced because of early
discontinuation) subsequently were enrolled at this dose
level to better clarify the toxicity profile.
Febrile neutropenia (attributed to VSLI in 4
patients) occurred in 14 patients (39%) overall, and bacteremia was the etiology in 7 of those episodes (50%).

Three younger patients (ages 24-31 years) died of infections during Cycle 1 of VSLI and dexamethasone, including 1 patient who died on Day 15 from Aspergillus
pneumonia, 1 patient who died on Day 18 from presumed septicemia, and 1 patient who died on Day 18
from Escherichia coli septicemia.
Three of 14 patients (21%) who continued VSLI
and dexamethasone beyond the first cycle underwent dose
reductions of VSLI (to the next lower dose level) for reasons of grade 2/3 constipation (n ¼ 2) or peripheral neuropathy (n ¼ 1). The median number of VSLI doses
administered overall was 4 (range, 2-11 VSLI doses). The
median body surface area (BSA) for the group was 2.1 m2
(range, 1.5-2.8 m2). The median calculated dose of VSLI
was 4.17 mg (range, 2.9-5.7 mg), which represented an
average increase in VCR dose of 52% (range, 31%-65%
increase) compared with conventional administration.
The median cumulative dose/BSA of VSLI was 9 mg/m2
(range, 4.5-19.7 mg/m2), and the median cumulative
dose was 19.2 mg (range, 10.2-38.1 mg).

* For first salvage prognostic groups, favorable characteristics included age <40 years, first CR duration >12 months, and absence of circulating blasts; intermediate characteristics included age 40 years or circulating blasts; and unfavorable characteristics included 2 unfavorable features (see Thomas 199922).
For second salvage prognostic groups, favorable characteristics included platelet count >50109/L and first CR duration >36 months; intermediate characteristics included 1 unfavorable feature; and unfavorable characteristics included both unfavorable features (see O’Brien 200823).

Concurrent Therapy
Five patients received IT chemotherapy during the course
of study participation. One patient developed CNS disease after 2 doses of VSLI and was treated with standard
doses of alternating IT chemotherapy (cytarabine with
methotrexate). The remaining 4 patients underwent diagnostic lumbar punctures concurrently with IT cytarabine
to evaluate headaches (not attributed to VSLI), and 2 of
those patients had CNS disease identified. None of the
patients who received IT chemotherapy had central neurologic DLT attributable to VSLI.
Thirty-one of 36 patients (86%) received concurrent azole prophylaxis, which consisted of either fluconazole alone (n ¼ 13) or fluconazole followed by
voriconazole (n ¼ 5) or itraconazole (n ¼ 1), usually
because of elevated hepatic transaminases. Itraconazole
was initiated and later was changed to voriconazole
because of gastrointestinal intolerance in 4 patients. Eight
patients received voriconazole as primary antifungal prophylaxis. The type of antifungal prophylaxis did not
appear to influence the incidence of peripheral neuropathy (Table 3). A higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy (76% vs 42%) was observed with a higher cumulative
dose of VSLI. Of the 3 patients who experienced DLT at
the 2.4 mg/m2 dose level, 2 patients had received fluconazole, and 1 patient had received liposomal amphoterocin
for antifungal prophylaxis.

Response
In evaluating the entire cohort of 36 patients who received
at least 1 dose of VSLI, the overall response rate
(CR þ PR) was 22% (95% CI, 10%-39%): 7 patients

patients (11%) achieved an HI, 22 patients (61%) failed
to achieve an objective response (including 9 patients with
progressive disease), and 2 patients (6%) were not evaluable. Responses were observed at all dose levels and in
heavily pretreated patients (Table 4). CR was achieved in
2 of the 7 patients (29%) with primary refractory disease
who failed to respond to induction chemotherapy regimens that included conventional VCR. Four of the 15
patients (27%) who had a first CR duration 12 months
achieved CR; 3 of 6 patients in this category achieved CR
with VSLI and dexamethasone as their first salvage
attempt.
Responses were categorized further (for the first and
second salvage subsets; n ¼ 28) according to expectations
of CR based on relevant pretreatment characteristics that
were established previously in prognostic models (Table
5).22,23 The largest subcategory included those with the
lowest expectation of CR, as expected. Response to VSLI
and dexamethasone correlated with risk group, with CR
rates ranging from 13% to 50% (Table 5).
Of the 7 complete responders, 4 patients underwent
allogeneic SCT after achieving remission with VSLI and
dexamethasone. It is noteworthy that 1 second-salvage
patient who achieved HI-PLT after 2 cycles of therapy
also proceeded to allogeneic SCT with minimal bone
marrow disease. The 3 patients who did not proceed to
SCT in CR after VSLI and dexamethasone eventually
relapsed. One patient who had precursor B-cell ALL in
first relapse after receiving the hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, VCR, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine
achieved a second CR with VSLI and dexamethasone but
relapsed after 2 months. One patient who had primary

refractory precursor B-cell ALL (failing to respond to 2
cycles of induction chemotherapy with hyper-CVAD and
rituximab) subsequently relapsed after a CR duration of 9
months. One patient who had Burkitt-type ALL in first
relapse after hyper-CVAD and rituximab was unable to
receive further VSLI-based therapy in CR because of
grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and relapsed 2 months
later with isolated CNS disease.

DISCUSSION
Outcomes with salvage chemotherapy for adults with
relapsed or refractory ALL traditionally have been
poor.22,23 Previous experience with single-agent VSLI
dosed at 2 mg/m2 every 2 weeks in adults with previously
treated ALL was encouraging; therefore, the current phase
1 clinical trial of weekly dose-escalated VSLI and pulse
dexamethasone was conducted.19 VSLI dosing was not
capped, resulting in an average increase in the VCR dose
of 52% (range, 31%-65%, depending on BSA and dose
level) compared with conventional administration. The
toxicity profile was as expected, with peripheral neuropathy (overall, 55%; grade 1/2, 47%) and medically manageable constipation (overall, 53%; grade 1/2, 47%) the
most common nonhematologic toxicities attributed
directly to VSLI, and the latter increased in frequency
with increasing dose levels. Concurrent administration of
triazole antifungal therapy may result in enhanced neurotoxicity through the inhibition of cytochrome P450mediated metabolism of vinca alkaloids, leading to
increased plasma levels of the drug.8 In the current study,
the incidence of peripheral neuropathy appeared to be
influenced by the cumulative exposure to VSLI rather
than the concurrent use of itraconazole or voriconazole.
The MTD was established at 2.25 mg/m2 based on the
DLT toxicities of grade 3 motor neuropathy, grade 4 seizure (in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage), and grade
4 hepatotoxicity observed in 1 patient each at the 2.4 mg/
m2 dose level.
In this study, the CR rate with VSLI and dexamethasone was 19% in the context of previous therapy with
conventional VCR (all patients). It is noteworthy that 2
patients who had primary refractory disease after frontline
therapy with hyper-CVAD achieved CR with VSLI-based
therapy. Response was evaluated further by comparing
outcomes after VSLI and dexamethasone with the expectCancer

ations of CR previously established in 2 separate, large,
retrospective analyses to account for the significant heterogeneity in the treatment population. In the primary refractory or first salvage setting, a previous analysis of
>300 patients with previously treated ALL identified
short duration of first CR (<12 months), age >40 years,
and presence of circulating blasts as adverse factors.22 The
rates of CR ranged from 24% to 31% after first salvage
therapy with intensive regimens (eg, high-dose cytarabine
combinations, hyper-CVAD). However, the CR rates varied from 9% to 47% after patients were categorized into
unfavorable, intermediate, and favorable prognostic
groups according to the number of adverse factors. In
another recent analysis of nearly 300 patients that was
confined to outcome after second salvage therapy, the
overall CR rate with various treatments was 18%. However, in that analysis, the CR rate was 7% if the first CR
duration was <36 months and if the pretreatment PLT
count was <50  109/L compared with a CR rate of 60%
if neither feature was present.23
In applying these prognostic models to the current
study cohort, the CR rates with VSLI and dexamethasone
by salvage status (29% for first salvage, 14% for second
salvage) and by risk group (50% for favorable, 22% intermediate, 13% for unfavorable) were similar to those
expected with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens but generally were superior to the historic experience with other investigational single agents (<10%). In
this study, dexamethasone was administered concurrently
with VSLI to facilitate multiple dosing because of the
transient bone marrow responses observed with the previous lower intensity single-agent VSLI salvage experience.
The relative contribution of dexamethasone cannot be
ascertained. It is unlikely that dexamethasone itself would
induce CR in the salvage setting; however, it is possible
that cytoreduction with this agent could allow continued
administration of VSLI and, thus, influence response.
Regardless, the combination of VSLI plus dexamethasone
appears to be an effective salvage therapy option for
patients who have relapsed/refractory ALL that may permit potentially curative SCT. A phase 2 international
multicenter clinical trial assessing the efficacy of weekly
single-agent VSLI dosed at 2.25 mg/m2 (without dexamethasone given the primary objective of response) as second salvage therapy for patients with previously treated
ALL is ongoing; preliminary efficacy has been observed
