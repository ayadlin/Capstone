Abstract
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor whose targets include
B-RAF and C-RAF, both of which function in the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway but which also
have distinct downstream targets. The relative effects of
sorafenib on B-RAF and C-RAF signaling in tumor cells remain unclear, however. We have now examined the effects of
sorafenib as well as of B-RAF or C-RAF depletion by RNA
interference on cell growth and ERK signaling in non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with or without KRAS mutations.
Sorafenib inhibited ERK phosphorylation in cells with wild-type
KRAS but not in those with mutant KRAS. Despite this difference, sorafenib inhibited cell growth and induced G1 arrest
in both cell types. Depletion of B-RAF, but not that of C-RAF,
inhibited ERK phosphorylation as well as suppressed cell
growth and induced G1 arrest in cells with wild-type KRAS. In
contrast, depletion of C-RAF inhibited cell growth and induced
G1 arrest, without affecting ERK phosphorylation, in cells with
mutant KRAS; depletion of B-RAF did not induce G1 arrest in
these cells. These data suggest that B-RAF-ERK signaling and
C-RAF signaling play the dominant roles in regulation of cell
growth in NSCLC cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS,
respectively. The G1 arrest induced by either C-RAF depletion
or sorafenib in cells with mutant KRAS was associated with
down-regulation of cyclin E. Our results thus suggest that
sorafenib inhibits NSCLC cell growth by targeting B-RAF in cells
with wild-type KRAS and C-RAF in those with mutant KRAS.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality
worldwide (1). Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced metastatic lung cancer, with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy conferring only a limited survival benefit. Target-based therapies
are therefore being pursued as potential treatment alternatives. The
RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-ERK signaling pathway is a
promising therapeutic target given its central role in regulation of
mammalian cell proliferation, relaying extracellular signals from
ligand-bound receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) at the cell surface to
the nucleus via a cascade of specific phosphorylation events and

beginning with the activation of the small GTPase RAS (2). Much
attention is thus being focused on the development of inhibitors of
this pathway.
RAF was the first effector kinase downstream of RAS to be
identified (3). To date, the most successful clinical inhibitor of RAF
activity is sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY 43-9006), an orally available
compound that has received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib is also currently undergoing clinical evaluation for a variety of additional cancers, including
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs. 4–7).
The mutational status of RAS and B-RAF genes is thought to affect
the sensitivity of tumor cell lines to sorafenib as a result of the inappropriate activation by such mutations of the MAPK pathway
mediated by ERK (8, 9). The sensitivity of tumor cell lines with
different RAS mutations to sorafenib is less well characterized than is
that of those with B-RAF mutations (10–14). Despite promising
results of clinical trials of sorafenib monotherapy in NSCLC patients
(4–7), little is known of the possible differences in the sorafenib
sensitivity of NSCLC cells according to the mutational status of
KRAS. We have therefore now examined the effects of RAF inhibition
on the growth of NSCLC cells with or without KRAS mutations and
further investigated the mechanisms of such effects.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The human NSCLC cell lines NCI-H292 (H292),
LK-2, Sq-1, NCI-H520 (H520), PC9, NCI-H1650 (H1650), HCC827, NCI-H1975
(H1975), A549, NCI-H460 (H460), NCI-H23 (H23), NCI-H358 (H358), and NCIH1299 (H1299) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Ma70 cells were obtained as previously described (15). All cells were cultured
under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC in RPMI 1640 (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sorafenib was kindly provided by
Bayer Pharmaceutical, dissolved in DMSO, and stored in aliquots at 20jC.
Assay of anchorage-dependent cell growth [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay]. Cells were plated in 96-well
flat-bottomed plates and cultured for 24 h before exposure to various concentrations of sorafenib for 72 h. TetraColor One (5 mmol/L tetrazolium
monosodium salt and 0.2 mmol/L 1-methoxy-5-methyl phenazinium
methylsulfate; Seikagaku) was then added to each well, and the cells were
incubated for 3 h at 37jC before measurement of absorbance at 490 nm with a
Multiskan Spectrum instrument (Thermo Labsystems). Absorbance values were
expressed as a percentage of that for untreated cells, and the concentration of
sorafenib resulting in 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was calculated.
Assay of anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar.
Anchorage-independent cell proliferation in soft agar was assayed with the
use of a CytoSelect 96-Well Cell Transformation Assay (Cell Biolabs). In brief,
cells were cultured for 7 d in complete medium containing soft agar and
various concentrations of sorafenib. The agar matrix was then solubilized, the
cells were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium

bromide (MTT) and lysed, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured
relative to that at a reference wavelength of 690 nm. Normalized absorbance
values were expressed as a percentage of that for untreated cells, and the IC50
of sorafenib for inhibition of colony formation was calculated.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed with
70% methanol, washed again with PBS, and stained with propidium iodide
(0.05 mg/mL) in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,
and RNase A (0.05 mg/mL). The stained cells (f1  106) were then analyzed
for DNA content with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) and
ModFit software (Verity Software House).
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
then lysed in a solution containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 Ag/mL leupeptin. The protein
concentration of lysates was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad),
and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel. The
separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was
then exposed to 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature
before incubation overnight at 4jC with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to
human phosphorylated ERK (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
ERK (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG epitope (1:1,000
dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), B-RAF (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), C-RAF (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), or h-actin
(1:500 dilution; Sigma) or with mouse monoclonal antibodies to cyclin E
(1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was then washed
with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 before incubation for 1 h at room
temperature with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat antibodies to
rabbit (Sigma) or mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoglobulin G.
Immune complexes were finally detected with chemiluminescence reagents
(Perkin-Elmer Life Science).
Forced expression of KRAS-V12. An expression vector for FLAG-tagged
human KRAS-V12 was constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNA into
the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). The expression vector was introduced into
H1299 cells by transfection for 48 h with the use of the Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen).
Gene silencing. Cells were plated at 50% to 60% confluence in six-well plates
or 25-cm2 flasks and then incubated for 24 h before transient transfection for
48 h with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mixed with the Lipofectamine reagent.
The siRNAs specific for B-RAF (5¶-AGACAGGAAUCGAAUGAAA-3¶) or C-RAF
(5¶-CCUCACGCCUUCACCUUUA-3¶) mRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon,
and a nonspecific siRNA (control) was obtained from Nippon EGT. The cells were
then subjected to immunoblot analysis or flow cytometry.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed t test.
A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Sorafenib inhibits cell growth by inducing G1 arrest in NSCLC
cell lines independently of KRAS genotype. The various isoforms
of RAF are the principal effectors of RAS in the ERK signaling pathway, and mutant RAS proteins trigger persistent activation of downstream effectors (3). To determine whether the mutational status of
KRAS might affect the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to sorafenib, an
inhibitor of the kinase activity of RAF (16), we first examined the
effects of this drug on the anchorage-dependent growth of NSCLC
cells with or without KRAS mutations by the MTT assay. Sorafenib
inhibited cell growth with IC50 values ranging from 7.4 to 11.3 Amol/L
in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS and from 5.6 to 14.1 Amol/L
in those with mutant KRAS (Fig. 1A), values that are within the
clinically relevant concentration range for this drug (17). This
inhibitory effect of sorafenib in cells with wild-type KRAS also
seemed to be independent of whether the cells contained a mutant
version of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. We next
investigated the effects of sorafenib on anchorage-independent colony
formation in soft agar, a more clinically relevant model of NSCLC cell

according to KRAS and EGFR mutational status. A, the indicated NSCLC cell
lines were cultured for 72 h in complete culture medium containing various
concentrations of sorafenib, after which cell viability was assessed with the MTT
assay and the IC50 values of sorafenib for inhibition of cell growth were determined.

containing soft agar and various concentrations of sorafenib, after which colony

proliferation. Sorafenib inhibited anchorage-independent colony
formation with IC50 values of 5.6 to 11.1 Amol/L in cells with wildtype KRAS and of 8.5 to 11.1 Amol/L in those with mutant KRAS
(Fig. 1B). These data thus indicated that sorafenib inhibits the growth
of NSCLC cells in a manner independent of KRAS mutational status.
To investigate the mechanism by which sorafenib inhibits
NSCLC cell growth, we examined the cell cycle profile by flow
cytometry. Sorafenib increased the proportion of cells in G1 phase
of the cell cycle and reduced that of cells in S or G2-M phases in all
tested cell lines regardless of KRAS mutational status (Fig. 2).
Sorafenib did not increase the proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase, a
characteristic of apoptosis. These data thus indicated that
sorafenib inhibits cell growth by inducing arrest of the cell cycle
in G1 phase.
Effects of sorafenib on the ERK signaling pathway in NSCLC
cell lines. To examine the effects of sorafenib on the ERK signaling
pathway in NSCLC cells, we performed immunoblot analysis with
antibodies specific for phosphorylated (activated) ERK. Sorafenib
markedly inhibited ERK phosphorylation in cells with wild-type KRAS
regardless of the mutational status of EGFR (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
sorafenib had no effect on the level of ERK phosphorylation in cells

Inhibition of NSCLC Cell Growth by Sorafenib

NSCLC cells classified according to KRAS and EGFR
status. Cells were incubated for 0, 24, or 48 h in complete
culture medium containing 15 Amol/L sorafenib and were

with mutant KRAS. To investigate further whether the effect of
sorafenib on ERK phosphorylation is dependent on KRAS mutational
status, we introduced an expression vector for FLAG epitope-tagged
KRAS with the activating Val12 mutation (KRAS-V12) into the human
NSCLC cell line H1299, which harbors wild-type endogenous KRAS.
Whereas sorafenib inhibited ERK phosphorylation in nontransfected
cells or cells transfected with the empty vector, it failed to do so in cells
expressing KRAS-V12 (Fig. 3B). These results thus suggested that
sorafenib blocks the ERK signaling pathway only in NSCLC cells
harboring wild-type KRAS.

B-RAF but not C-RAF depletion inhibits ERK phosphorylation
in NSCLC cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS. The mammalian
RAF family includes A-RAF, B-RAF, and C-RAF, all of which function
in the ERK pathway but also have different downstream phosphorylation targets and play distinct roles in signaling (18). Although
suggested to be a B-RAF inhibitor, sorafenib inhibits the activity of
C-RAF with a potency 4-fold that apparent for B-RAF (16). To investigate the downstream consequences of B-RAF and C-RAF signaling
in NSCLC cells, we examined the effects of the depletion of these
kinases with a siRNA-based approach. Immunoblot analysis revealed

vector and were then incubated for 2 h in the presence or absence of sorafenib (15 Amol/L). Cell lysates (25 Ag of soluble protein) were then subjected to immunoblot
analysis with antibodies to FLAG and to phosphorylated or total forms of ERK.

Figure 4. Effects of transient depletion of B-RAF or C-RAF on ERK
phosphorylation in NSCLC cells. Cells harboring wild-type or mutant KRAS were
transfected with nonspecific (control), B-RAF, or C-RAF siRNAs for 48 h, after
which cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with
antibodies to B-RAF, C-RAF, phosphorylated ERK, and h-actin (loading control).

that transfection of NSCLC cells with siRNAs specific for B-RAF or
C-RAF mRNAs resulted in marked and selective depletion of the
corresponding protein (Fig. 4). Such depletion of B-RAF resulted in
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in cells harboring wild-type or
mutant KRAS, whereas depletion of C-RAF had no such effect (Fig. 4).
These data thus suggested that depletion of B-RAF, but not that of
C-RAF, inhibits ERK phosphorylation regardless of KRAS status.
Effects of RAF depletion on NSCLC cell proliferation. We next
examined the effects of B-RAF or C-RAF depletion on NSCLC cell
proliferation and cell cycle distribution. Depletion of B-RAF resulted
in significant inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 5A) and an increase
in the proportion of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 5B),
whereas depletion of C-RAF had no such effects, in NSCLC cells
harboring wild-type KRAS. In contrast, depletion of C-RAF induced
significant inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 5A) and an increase in
the proportion of cells in G1 phase (Fig. 5B), whereas depletion of BRAF had only a less pronounced effect on cell proliferation, in NSCLC
cells with mutant KRAS. These data thus suggested that B-RAF-ERK
signaling regulates cell proliferation in NSCLC cells with wild-type
KRAS, whereas C-RAF signaling mediates such regulation in NSCLC
cells with mutant KRAS.
Sorafenib or C-RAF depletion inhibits cyclin E expression in
NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS. Finally, to characterize further
the growth inhibition and G1 arrest induced by C-RAF depletion or
sorafenib in NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS, we examined the
expression of cyclin E, an essential promoter of the transition from
G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (19). Immunoblot analysis revealed
that depletion of C-RAF in A549 or H460 cells resulted in
pronounced inhibition of cyclin E expression, whereas depletion
of B-RAF had no such effect (Fig. 6). Exposure of the cells to
sorafenib also induced loss of cyclin E (Fig. 6). These results thus
suggest that the G1 arrest induced by depletion of C-RAF or by
sorafenib in NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS may be attributable to
the down-regulation of cyclin E.

Discussion
RAS is an upstream component of the ERK signaling pathway,
which is aberrantly activated by oncogenic mutations of RAS genes.
Among RAS family genes, mutations of KRAS are most common in
solid malignancies, including NSCLC (8, 20, 21). Indeed, KRAS
mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and resistance

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in NSCLC (22–24). Whereas
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are most efficacious in NSCLC
patients with EGFR mutations, KRAS mutations are associated with
resistance to these agents (25–28). The development of therapeutic
strategies for NSCLC patients with KRAS mutations is thus an
important clinical goal. RAF serine-threonine kinases are the
principal effectors of RAS in the ERK signaling pathway. Given the
key role of this pathway in tumor growth, RAF is a potential target for
cancer therapy.
Sorafenib is an orally available compound that has been developed
as a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RAF and several
RTKs. The sensitivity of cancer cells to sorafenib might be expected
to be affected by KRAS status, given that KRAS mutations result in
activation of the ERK pathway (8). However, as far as we are aware,
no previous study has compared sorafenib sensitivity among a panel
of tumor cell lines of different KRAS mutational status. We have now
evaluated the effects of sorafenib on the growth of NSCLC cells
harboring wild-type or mutant forms of KRAS with two different
assay systems, the MTT assay and anchorage-independent colony
formation assay, given that previous studies have revealed differences in the sensitivity of cells to tested drugs between these two
assay systems (29). The IC50 values for inhibition of cell growth by
sorafenib in these assays have generally been found to be well below
15 Amol/L, the maximum achievable plasma concentration of this
drug (17). We found that the potency of sorafenib for inhibition of cell
growth was similar for NSCLC cells regardless of KRAS mutational
status in both assay systems. We also performed a longer-term
clonogenic survival assay and again found that sorafenib inhibited
the survival of NSCLC cells regardless of KRAS status (data not
shown). These results thus indicate that sorafenib inhibits the
growth of NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS as well as it does that of
those with wild-type KRAS in a clinically relevant concentration
range.
We have shown that sorafenib inhibited ERK phosphorylation and
induced G1 arrest in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS, consistent
with previous results obtained with several cancer cell lines
harboring wild-type KRAS (13, 30, 31). Inhibition of the ERK signaling
pathway, as reflected by a reduced level of ERK phosphorylation,
results in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of G1 arrest in
various cell types (32–35). In the present study, we found that
depletion of B-RAF by RNA interference also inhibited ERK
phosphorylation as well as attenuated cell proliferation and induced
G1 arrest in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS. These results suggest
that inhibition of B-RAF-ERK signaling contributes to suppression of
the growth of NSCLC cells harboring wild-type KRAS by sorafenib.
Consistent with these findings, the specific B-RAF inhibitor SB590885 was previously shown to inhibit ERK phosphorylation and to
induce G1 arrest in melanoma cells with wild-type KRAS (36, 37). In
contrast, we found that depletion of C-RAF did not result in
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in NSCLC cells. ERK activation
was previously shown to be conserved in cells derived from C-RAF
knockout mice, suggesting that C-RAF is dispensable for ERK
signaling (38, 39). Together, the present data suggest that B-RAF-ERK
signaling, rather than C-RAF signaling, is a potential therapeutic
target in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS.
We showed that ERK phosphorylation was not inhibited by
sorafenib in two NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H460) harboring
mutant KRAS, consistent with previous observations (16). We
further showed this to be the case in two additional such cell
lines (H358 and H23). Such results were previously suggested to
be due to the existence of RAF-independent ERK activation in

Inhibition of NSCLC Cell Growth by Sorafenib

NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS (16). However, we have now
shown that B-RAF depletion resulted in inhibition of ERK
activation in these cells. Our data therefore suggest that sorafenib
is not able to attenuate the constitutive activation of the B-RAFERK pathway characteristic of NSCLC cells harboring mutant
KRAS (40). Despite the sustained activation of B-RAF-ERK
signaling in such cells, sorafenib inhibited cell proliferation and
induced G1 arrest in NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS as well as in
those with wild-type KRAS. These data suggest that sorafenib
targets a different pathway in its inhibitory effect on cell growth
in NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS. Whereas sorafenib inhibits the
kinase activity of both B-RAF and C-RAF, it shows a higher
affinity for C-RAF (16). We found that depletion of C-RAF by RNA
interference inhibited cell proliferation and induced G1 arrest,
without affecting ERK phosphorylation, in NSCLC cells with
mutant KRAS, whereas it did not exhibit such effects in NSCLC
cells harboring wild-type KRAS. Depletion of B-RAF also inhibited
the growth of NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS, although this effect
was not as pronounced as that in those with wild-type KRAS.

These data indicate that NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS are
dependent on C-RAF signaling to a greater extent than on B-RAFERK signaling for cell proliferation but that both pathways
participate in regulation of the growth of these cells. Melanoma
cells that have acquired resistance to a specific B-RAF inhibitor
were recently shown to have switched their dependency from BRAF to C-RAF (41). These observations suggest that RAF proteins
are functionally interchangeable in the regulation of cell growth.
Our data thus indicate that C-RAF signaling is a potential
therapeutic target in NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS. RAF family
proteins are also implicated in regulation of cell cycle progression
in a manner independent of the ERK pathway (18, 38, 42, 43). CRAF has been shown to exist in a complex with Cdc25, which
activates the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex and promotes the G1-S phase
transition (44, 45). Cyclin E is thus postulated to be a downstream
effector of C-RAF. In the present study, we found that either CRAF depletion or sorafenib treatment induced G1 arrest and
down-regulation of cyclin E in NSCLC cells with mutant KRAS.
Although we cannot exclude a possible role for other cell cycle

Sorafenib inhibits several RTKs that participate in neovascularization, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR)-2 and VEGFR-3 (16). Inhibition of angiogenesis might
thus be expected to contribute to the inhibition of tumor growth by
this drug in addition to its effects on RAF signaling. Although
sorafenib was previously shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of
human tumor xenografts in mice (13, 16, 46), it has been difficult to
measure the relative contributions of its antiangiogenic activity
and its direct antitumor activity mediated by RAF inhibition. In the
present study, we have provided insight into the inhibitory effect of
sorafenib on tumor cell growth in vitro that is mediated by
inhibition of RAF signaling pathways. Our results suggest that
sorafenib targets B-RAF in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS and CRAF in those with mutant KRAS, and they provide a rationale for
future clinical investigation of the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib
for NSCLC patients.
