BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors are at an increased risk of bone loss. The
current study was undertaken to determine whether upfront versus delayed treatment with zoledronic acid (ZA) impacted bone loss.
This report described the 5-year follow-up results. METHODS: A total of 551 postmenopausal women with breast cancer who completed tamoxifen treatment and were undergoing daily letrozole treatment were randomized to either upfront (274 patients) or delayed
(277 patients) ZA at a dose of 4 mg intravenously every 6 months. In the patients on the delayed treatment arm, ZA was initiated for a
postbaseline bone mineral density T-score of <-2.0 or fracture. RESULTS: The incidence of a 5% decrease in the total lumbar spine
bone mineral density at 5 years was 10.2% in the upfront treatment arm versus 41.2% in the delayed treatment arm (P<.0001). A total of
41 patients in the delayed treatment arm were eventually started on ZA. With the exception of increased NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
(CTC) grade 1/2 elevated creatinine and fever in the patients treated on the upfront arm and cerebrovascular ischemia among those in
the delayed treatment arm, there were no significant differences observed between arms with respect to the most common adverse
events of arthralgia and back pain. Osteoporosis occurred less frequently in the upfront treatment arm (2 vs 8 cumulative cases),
although this difference was not found to be statistically significant. Bone fractures occurred in 24 patients in the upfront treatment
arm versus 25 patients in the delayed treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate treatment with ZA prevented bone loss compared
with delayed treatment in postmenopausal women receiving letrozole and these differences were maintained at 5 years. The incidence

INTRODUCTION
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are routinely incorporated in the adjuvant setting for postmenopausal women with hormone
receptor-positive breast cancer.1 Several trials have demonstrated that treatment with AIs leads to decreases in bone density2-8 and, with the exception of the MA.17 study,2 lower bone density is reported to correspond with an increased risk of
fracture, although to the best of our knowledge none of the studies were specifically designed to evaluate this endpoint.

Original Article

The role of administering bisphosphonates to prevent bone pathology in women undergoing treatment
with AIs remains controversial. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is
an intravenous bisphosphonate approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal
women. In the final results of the Z-FAST (ZometaFemara Adjuvant Synergy Trial) trial, which randomized
602 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were receiving treatment with adjuvant letrozole
to either upfront or delayed ZA for 5 years, the adjusted
mean differences in lumbar spine and total hip bone
mineral density (BMD) between patients on the upfront
and delayed treatment arms were 8.9% and 6.7%,
respectively (P<.0001 for both), with improved bone
density noted among patients in the upfront ZA arm.9
Criteria for the delayed group to initiate ZA included a
lumbar spine or total hip T-score of <-2 or a nontraumatic clinical fracture.
The current study had a study design similar to that
of the Z-FAST trial.10 The early (1-year) findings from
this trial demonstrated that upfront treatment with ZA
prevented bone loss among postmenopausal women with
breast cancer who were initiating treatment with letrozole
after the completion of tamoxifen therapy.11 Longer
follow-up was essential to assess whether the observed
effect was durable and whether changes in BMD could
serve as surrogates for fracture risk. Herein, the 5-year follow-up results of the current study are described.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The N03CC trial was conducted by the North Central
Cancer Treatment Group (now part of the Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology) and primarily funded by the
National Cancer Institute with supplemental funding
provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals (East Hanover,
NJ), which otherwise had no involvement in the conduct
of the study. Approval for the study was obtained from
the local Institutional Review Board from participating
sites and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.
The design of the N03CC trial has been described previously.11 Briefly, the study population consisted of postmenopausal women with an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2
and a history of stage I to stage IIIA estrogen receptorpositive and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer who had completed 6 years of tamoxifen treatment
with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. At the
time of study entry, patients were required to have Tscores of -2. Key exclusion criteria included a history of
2538

fracture in the absence of (or low-intensity) trauma; clinical/radiologic evidence of existing lumbar spine or total
hip fracture; prior treatment with endocrine therapy,
including estrogen or corticosteroids within the last 12
months; any prior treatment with an AI or intravenous
bisphosphonates; and prior exposure to anabolic steroids
or growth hormone within the last 6 months.
In this open-label phase 3 trial, patients were randomly assigned to upfront versus delayed ZA. All
patients received letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg daily, vitamin D at a dose of 400 IU daily, and calcium at a dose
of 500 mg twice daily. The determinants for receipt of
ZA in the patients in the delayed treatment arm included
the development of a fracture or a T-score of <-2 at the
lumbar spine or femoral neck at any time during the
study. Lumbar and thoracic spine x-rays were performed
at the discretion of the treating physician during the
course of participation to confirm evidence of a clinical
fracture, or at month 36 if there was no clinical evidence
of fracture. ZA at a dose of 4 mg intravenously (with
adjustments for creatinine clearance if necessary) was
administered every 6 months for a duration of 5 years or
until recurrence of breast cancer; dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry scans were obtained at baseline and at
12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.
Statistical Analysis

A complete description of the statistical analysis has been
published previously.11 Two-sample Student t tests were
used to compare the average change in the lumbar spine
BMD at years 2 to 5, as well as the average change in the
femoral neck and total hip BMD at years 1 to 5 between
the 2 treatment arms. A clinically significant decrease in
BMD, as well as the annual incidence rates of osteoporosis, bone fractures, and toxicity between the 2 treatment
arms, was compared via chi-square testing. The primary
and secondary endpoints were the mean intrapatient average percent change (in g/cm2) in total lumbar spine BMD
from baseline to 12 months, and from baseline to 24, 36,
48, and 60 months after study entry, respectively. Additional secondary endpoints included the development of
osteoporosis (defined as standardized BMD of at least 2.5
standard deviations below peak young values at any measured site), hip BMD, incidence of fractures, and toxicity.
Patients randomized to the delayed treatment arm who
subsequently crossed over to receive ZA were analyzed
with patients in the delayed treatment arm. The study was
designed to have 90% power to detect a 2.9% difference
in the average percent change from baseline in lumbar
spine BMD between the treatment arms with a 5% type I

error rate. A 5% difference in intrapatient BMD from
baseline was defined as clinically significant. Stratification
factors included duration of prior tamoxifen, use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and baseline BMD T-scores. The
lumbar spine BMD between the patients receiving
upfront and delayed treatment was compared by a
repeated measures model of yearly BMD score, adjusting
for patient characteristics such as race, duration of tamoxifen, ECOG performance status, and prior chemotherapy.
Adverse events were graded according to NCI Common
Toxicity Criteria (CTC).
Data collection and statistical analyses were conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center. Data
quality was ensured by review of data by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and by the study chairperson following Alliance policies (allianceforclinicaltrialsinoncology.
org/main/public/standard.xhtml?path 5 %2FPublic percent2FGovernance). Results analyzed were available in the
study database as of August 17, 2012.
RESULTS
Between February 2005 and March 2006, a total of 558
patients were enrolled (Fig. 1). Of these, 551 patients initiated treatment (274 patients on the upfront ZA arm and
277 patients on the delayed ZA arm) at a dose of 4 mg
every six months. The number of patients evaluable for
the 5-year primary BMD endpoint was 237 (118 patients
on the upfront ZA arm and 119 patients on the delayed
ZA arm). Baseline patient characteristics were well
balanced between the arms (Table 1).11 Patients in the
upfront and delayed treatment arms went off study for
similar reasons, with the most common including patient
refusal (51 patients and 47 patients, respectively), adverse
events (23 patients and 24 patients, respectively), and disease progression (13 patients in both arms).

(Fig. 2). The difference in mean percent change between
the arms was 5.3%, 7.34%, and 9.42% at 1 year, 2 years,
and 5 years, respectively. The incidence of a 3% decrease
in lumbar spine BMD at 5 years was 12.7% (15 of 118
patients) versus 47.9% (57 of 119 patients) in the
upfront and delayed treatment arms, respectively
(P<.0001). A significant difference was maintained
when a 5% decrease in lumbar spine BMD at 5 years
was evaluated, with only slightly lower incidences
observed (10.2% in the upfront arm vs 41.2% in the
delayed arm; P<.0001). In addition, comparing a 10%
decrease in lumbar spine BMD at 5 years demonstrated
significant differences between the treatment arms (5.1%
in the upfront arm vs 16.8% in the delayed arm;
P<.01). The mixed model of total lumbar spine score
demonstrated that patients in the upfront ZA arm
tended to have higher lumbar spine scores (P<.0001).
Furthermore, race, duration of tamoxifen, ECOG performance status, and prior chemotherapy were found to
significantly impact the lumbar spine BMD (Table 2).
The mean change and mean percent change in the
femoral neck BMD from baseline were significantly
higher among patients in the upfront ZA arm (Fig. 3).
Similar findings were encountered with the hip scores
across all of these parameters. The incidence of a 5%
decrease in femoral neck and total hip BMD at year 5
was 7.6% in patients in the upfront ZA arm compared
with 45.8% in patients in the delayed treatment arm
(P<.0001).
At the end of 1 year, there were 221 patients in the
delayed treatment arm, 41 of whom (18.6%) crossed over
to treatment with ZA; this involved 10 patients, 16
patients, 8 patients, 7 patients, and 0 patients in the first
through fifth years, respectively.
Osteoporosis/Fractures

Bone Mineral Density

Total lumbar spine BMD data were evaluable from 429
patients, 377 patients, 336 patients, 294 patients, and
259 patients at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5
years, respectively. Long-term follow-up of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated a gain in total lumbar
spine BMD from baseline to 5 years of 0.58 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.45-0.72) for patients in the
upfront ZA arm compared with a loss for patients in the
delayed arm of 20.24 (95% CI, 20.36 to 20.12;
P<.001). Patients in the upfront ZA arm had statistically
significantly higher values for both changes and mean
percent change in lumbar spine total BMD from baseline
compared with individuals in the delayed ZA arm
Cancer

Two patients developed osteoporosis (1 each at years 2
and 3) in the upfront ZA arm compared with 8 patients
(3 patients in year 1, 2 patients in year 2, 1 patient in year
3, and 2 patients in year 4) in the delayed treatment arm.
However, these differences in the incidence of osteoporosis between treatment arms were not found to be statistically significant (P 5.072). The number of bone fractures
between treatment arms was nearly the same: 24 for
upfront ZA versus 25 for delayed ZA (P 5.84).
Adverse Events

Adverse events were reported to occur in >10% of
patients treated on either arm and included arthralgias,
back pain, hot flashes, myalgias, and nausea and vomiting,

with no significant difference noted between treatment
arms. The incidence of fever (9% vs 3%) and elevated creatinine (9% vs 5%) was higher in the upfront treatment
arm, with P values of .004 and .041, respectively. The
increased creatinine level was grade 1/2 in 96% of cases
in the upfront treatment arm, with 1 case of a grade 4
increase. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events
occurring at any time point from baseline through 5
years of follow-up was 24% (68 patients) in the delayed
treatment arm compared with 28% (76 patients) in the
upfront treatment arm. Three cases of life-threatening
cerebrovascular ischemia occurred among patients in the
delayed ZA arm. Three patients in the upfront treatment
arm experienced grade 4 toxicities requiring hospitalization and were considered by the treating physician to be
possibly related to treatment, including myocardial ischemia, pain, and decreased serum calcium. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 4 of the 274 patients in the
upfront treatment arm (2%) and in 2 of the 277 patients

in the delayed treatment arm (1%) after crossover
(P 5 .40).
Breast Cancer Progression

Progression events occurred in 13 patients on each treatment arm (4.7%). No deaths were reported to occur on either arm. There were insufficient data to examine the
treatment impact on overall or progression-free survival.
DISCUSSION
The N03CC and the Z-FAST sister trials (Z-FAST, ZOFAST, and E-ZO-FAST) were similarly designed to
address the question of whether early versus delayed initiation of bone-conserving therapy impacted BMD in postmenopausal women undergoing treatment with an
AI.9,12,13 The absolute difference in lumbar spine BMD
between the treatment arms in the current study was similar to those of the Z-FAST companion trials. At 5 years,
the absolute differences in lumbar spine BMD were 8.9%

ence in lumbar spine BMD was 5.43%, compared with
5.3% in the current study. In contrast to the N03CC trial,
which included treatment with tamoxifen before AI therapy, patients in the Z-FAST trials received only AIs.
Because tamoxifen mitigates bone loss in postmenopausal
women, concern may be expressed that the current trial
findings do not fully reflect the potential protective effects
of ZA for individuals treated with AIs alone. However,
the similar findings encountered in the current study as
well as the Z-FAST trials suggest that the bone loss associated with AIs is independent of preceding tamoxifen
administration.
The lack of a correlation between bone loss and the
incidence of fracture observed in the current study and
other prevention trials9,12 poses the question regarding
the definition of meaningful bone loss, particularly in a
younger patient population whose baseline fracture risk is
not high. A decline of 10% to 12% (1 standard deviation)
in BMD approximately doubles the risk of fracture.14
Given this association, the current study defined a 5%

difference in intrapatient BMD from baseline as being
clinically significant. At 5 years of follow-up, the incidence of a 5% decrease in lumbar spine BMD between
the treatment arms was found to be highly significant
(41.2% in the delayed treatment arm vs 10.2% in the
upfront treatment arm), yet no difference in the incidence
of osteoporosis or fractures was demonstrated. Because
errors between any 2 BMD measurements of 2% to 6%
have been described,15 the Z-FAST trial selected a
decrease of 8% in BMD as being clinically significant.10
Although the Z-FAST trial was not designed or
adequately powered to detect a difference in fracture rates
between groups, the slight increase in fractures demonstrated in the group treated with delayed versus those
treated with upfront ZA at month 61 (33 fractures vs 28
fractures) was not statistically significant.9 Whether a
selected higher threshold for BMD loss may have corresponded to fracture risk in these studies is speculative,
although one can conclude from the original adjuvant AI
studies2,4,16 that a subset of patients may have benefited
from bisphosphonates.
The MA.17 trial, which treated postmenopausal
patients with 5 years of tamoxifen treatment followed by
letrozole versus placebo, did not detect a statistically significant difference in the clinical fracture rate between the
treatment arms (5.3% vs 4.6%; P 5.25). However, the risk
of fracture with letrozole compared with tamoxifen was
found to be increased in the Breast International Group
(BIG) 1-98 trial (5.7% vs 4.0%; P<.0001) as well as in the
ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination)
trial (5.9% vs 3.7%; P<.0001).2,4,16 It is interesting to
note that fracture rates decreased at the time of cessation of
the AI in the ATAC trial.17 The incidence rate ratio was
1.55 during active treatment and declined to 1.03 after
treatment completion. These findings highlight the temporary and reversible impact of AIs on bone loss.
Because the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture
was not significantly different between the treatment

arms, the findings of the current study do not strongly
support the routine upfront administration of ZA.
A meta-analysis of 7 studies including 7967 patients
demonstrated a fracture benefit with ZA (odds ratio,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96); however, subgroup analyses
according to menopausal status were not performed and
it is unclear whether a benefit would be observed in
younger women.18 Although upfront use remains controversial from the standpoint of osteoporosis and fracture risk, the decision to initiate ZA therapy in
postmenopausal women receiving treatment with AIs
may be based on a potential survival benefit.12,18-20 A
recently presented Oxford meta-analysis21 has provided
more definitive evidence regarding the potential benefit
of bisphosphonates such as zoledronate (ZA) for improving outcomes in postmenopausal women with resected
breast cancer. This new report appears to influence clinical decisions regarding the use of ZA in clinical practice
for postmenopausal women. The current study is limited
in that it was not powered to adequately address survival
differences, yet it provides insight into the feasibility of
delaying treatment with ZA.
FUNDING SUPPORT
