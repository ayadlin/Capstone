BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to determine whether the use of cochlear-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) boost results in excess local failures in children with medulloblastoma. METHODS: Fifty
children with a median age of 7.8 years underwent resection, craniospinal irradiation (CSI), IMRT posterior fossa (PF)
and/or tumor bed (TB) boost, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy for medulloblastoma. For standard-risk patients,
the CSI dose was 18 to 23.4 grays (Gy) and was followed either by an IMRT PF boost to 36 Gy and a TB boost of 54
to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 29) or by an IMRT TB boost to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 4). For high-risk patients, the CSI dose was 36 to 39.6
Gy followed by an IMRT PF boost to 54 to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 8), an IMRT PF boost to 45 Gy and a TB boost to 55.8 Gy
(n ¼ 2), or an IMRT TB boost to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 7). For the TB boost, a 2-cm margin around the surgical bed was
treated in most patients. RESULTS: The 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates (standard deviation) were
72%  6.6% and 68.3%  6.8%, respectively, for all patients; 77.8%  7.4% and 75.1%  7.6%, respectively, for standard-risk patients; and 60.8%  12.8% and 55.4%  12.8%, respectively, for high-risk patients. The 5-year PF control rate
was 90.5%  4.6%. TB failures occurred in 3 patients (including 2 patients who had distant failure), whereas an isolated non-TB PF failure occurred in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IMRT was associated with excellent local

Recent advances in multimodality treatment have resulted in improved outcomes in children with medulloblastoma.1-3 In radiation oncology alone, the advent of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiotherapy (RT) has revolutionized the field
by using image-based target volumes and avoidance structures.4,5 Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) further
refines 3-D treatment delivery by combining inverse treatment planning with optimization and computer-controlled intensity modulation of the radiation beam.6 One of the first indications for IMRT in the treatment of children has been its
use in the boost field for medulloblastoma; several dosimetric studies have demonstrated the superiority of IMRT to conventional or 3-D RT with respect to its cochlear-sparing ability.7,8
One of the main concerns is whether the use of IMRT will result in more local failures, because the high-dose region
surrounding the clinical target volume (CTV) is reduced compared with the target volume in conventional and 3-D
RT.7,9 In addition, recent advances in neuroimaging have prompted several investigators to treat the tumor bed (TB) with
a margin instead of the entire posterior fossa (PF) to full doses during the boost portion of the RT course in standard-risk
patients.9-12 Since 1996, we have used IMRT to treat the TB and/or PF during the RT boost portion for medulloblastoma.8 To examine whether local control is compromised by the use of IMRT and TB boost, we analyzed our institutional
experience.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1996 to 2005, 50 children who had medulloblastoma diagnosed at Texas Children’s Cancer Center were
treated at The Methodist Hospital Department of Radiation Oncology and had received cochlear-sparing IMRT
boost. The medical and RT records of these patients were
reviewed retrospectively after institutional review board
approval at both The Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine. There were 36 males and 14 females
with a median age at the time of RT of 7.8 years (range,
from 33 months to 18 years). The risk category was standard in 33 patients (66%) and high in 17 patients (34%).
Patients underwent a maximal safe resection and received
craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and IMRT to the PF and/
or the TB followed by chemotherapy. The chemotherapy
delivered was cisplatin-based, and patients were treated on
multi-institutional protocols (St. Jude Medulloblastoma
96, Children’s Cancer Group/Pediatric Oncology Group
[CCG/POG] trial A9961) or according to institutional
chemotherapy guidelines.1,13,14
Patients with standard-risk disease received 18 to
23.4 grays (Gy) of CSI followed by either 1) a PF boost to
36 Gy and a TB boost of 54 to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 29) or 2) a
TB boost to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 4). Only 1 patient was received
18-Gy CSI because of young age; the remaining patients
received 23.4-Gy CSI. Patients with high-risk disease
received 36 to 39.6 Gy CSI followed by 1) a PF boost of
54 to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 8), 2) a PF boost to 45 Gy and a TB
boost to 55.8 Gy (n ¼ 2) or 3) a TB boost to 55.8 Gy
(n ¼ 7). Additional boosts to the brain and spine were
permitted for M2 and M3 lesions up to a total dose of 45
to 50.4 Gy. CSI was delivered with the patient in the
prone position until 2004, when patients were treated in
the supine position.15
All patients received computed tomography (CT)
simulation. Immobilization for these patients has previously been discussed in previous reports from our institution.8,15 Preoperative and postoperative MRI scans were
fused to the CT simulation images. IMRT was inversely
planned using the NOMOS CORVUS system (NOMOS
Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pa). Before 2004, patients were
received dynamic sequential arc therapy (MIMiC;
NOMOS Corporation). The later patients received
IMRT using a step-and-shoot sliding window technique.
For patients who received a PF boost, the clinical target
volume (CTV) was the entire PF. The CTV for the entire
PF included the portion of the brain bounded by the following anatomic landmarks: tentorium cerebelli superiorly, foramen magnum inferiorly, posterior clinoid

636

anteriorly, and bony confines of the cerebellum posteriorly. The brainstem was part of the CTV for patients who
received the PF boost. For standard-risk and high-risk
patients who received PF followed by TB boost, the CTV
for the TB boost was defined as the gross tumor volume
(GTV) or the primary TB and residual tumor with a 2-cm
margin. For standard-risk and high-risk patients who
received only a TB boost, the CTV was defined as the
GTV with a 1-cm to 2-cm margin. The CTV did not
extend to the bony confines of the PF. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the CTV with a 3-mm
margin for both PF boost and TB boost. The entire PTV
was covered by at least 95% of the prescription dose. No
greater than 10% of the PTV received >110% of the prescribed dose. Dose constraints for various structures in the
brain and head and neck were as follows: optic chiasm, 45
Gy; optic nerves, 45 Gy; brainstem, 54 Gy; spinal cord,
50.4 Gy; and lenses, 8 Gy. Although the entire circumference of the brainstem was included in the PF boost, only
the portion of brainstem next to the TB was included in
the TB boost. Every effort was made to limit the nontarget
brainstem dose to 54 Gy. For the temporal lobes, the
dose constraint generally was 50% of the IMRT boost
dose. In patients who received 23.4 Gy and 36 Gy CSI,
dose constraints for the temporal lobe were approximately
40 Gy and 46 Gy, respectively. For the cochlea, the dose
constraint generally was 40% of the IMRT boost dose. In
patients who received 23.4 Gy and 36 Gy CSI, dose constraints for the cochlea were approximately 37 Gy and 45
Gy, respectively. The organs of avoidance that received
the highest priority were the spinal cord, brainstem, optic
chiasm, and cochlea. Examples of PF and TB IMRT cochlear-sparing boost plans are provided in Figure 1.
Failures were considered to be in the TB if the recurrence was within the high-dose region (95% of the prescribed dose) of the surgical bed and/or residual tumor
volume (Fig. 2). All other PF recurrences outside this volume, including marginal recurrences, were classified as
non-TB PF recurrences (Fig. 3). Leptomeningeal recurrences in the brain and spine were considered distant disease. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 68
months (range, 19-127 months).

DISCUSSION
One of the major concerns in the radiation oncology community is whether there will be excess marginal recurrences in the era of IMRT.16 In medulloblastoma,
marginal recurrences can occur particularly near the cochlea, which is a major avoidance structure, or in the nonCancer

TB PF, which does not receive a dose of 54 to 55.8 Gy.
The concern for marginal failures is more important with
IMRT compared with conventional RT or 3-D conformal RT, because less surrounding normal tissues receive
the prescription dose with IMRT. The current study demonstrates that PF control is excellent with the use of
IMRT and is comparable to the results obtained using 3D conformal RT (Table 2).9,11,12,17 Two previous articles
included IMRT patients in their report; in both studies,
<50% of patients received IMRT. The outcomes using
this approach compared with 3-D conformal RT were not
addressed specifically.9,11 Wolden et al treated 12 of 32
children using an IMRT approach: One isolated non-TB
PF failure occurred in that trial, but there was no mention
whether this patient received IMRT or 3-D conformal
RT.11 A recent abstract on 34 patients who received
IMRT at the same institution reported only 2 PF failures.18 A report by Merchant et al stated that, 4 PF failures
occurred; the technique used in these 4 patients was not
addressed.9
Our results along with others also indicate that there
were no excess failures in the non-TB PF with the use of a
TB boost in standard-risk patients.11,12 The appropriate
boost field after CSI in medulloblastoma is controversial.
The COG ACNS0331 study currently is randomizing
standard-risk patients to receive a PF boost versus a TB
boost to help address this issue. The standard boost volume that needs to receive 54 to 55.8 Gy is the entire PF;
however, the single-institution studies mentioned above
suggest that a TB boost of 54 to 55.8 Gy after CSI may
suffice in standard-risk patients after 23.4 to 36 Gy to the
PF. There is heterogeneity of treatments in the patients
who received TB boost. Many of the children in our study
have received at least 36 Gy to the PF followed by the TB
boost. In the Memorial Hospital and University of Washington experience, many of the patients received 23.4 Gy
CSI followed by a TB boost.11,12 In the ACNS0331
study, patients receive a TB boost after 23.4 Gy to the
entire PF. Another unanswered question is whether highrisk patients should be getting a TB boost or a PF boost.
Nearly half of the high-risk patients in our study received
a TB boost after 36 to 39.6 Gy to the PF. In the Memorial
Hospital series, high-risk patients received a TB boost after 36 Gy CSI. The other issue regarding TB boost is the
extent of the margin required around the TB and/or residual nodule (CTV). Almost all patients in our study who
received a TB boost had a 2-cm margin around the TB
with a 3-mm expansion for the PTV. At Memorial Hospital, a 1-cm margin is used for the CTV with a 5-mm

expansion for the PTV.18 In the current COG
ACNS0331 study, the CTV for a TB boost is 1.5 cm with
a 3-mm to 5-mm expansion for the PTV.
Compared with studies that used 2-dimensional (2D) RT to boost the entire PF, PF control rates are higher
in the 3-D RT conformal era, ranging from 90% to 100%
at 5 years (Table 2). In previous reports that described patterns of failure after 2-D RT, 17.4% to 44% of patients
failed in the PF after CSI and a PF boost.19-23 There are
several possible reasons why patients who receive treatment during the 3-D RT era have better local control
than patients who received treatment during the 2-D RT
era. First, patients who receive 3-D conformal RT have
better imaging modalities available for both diagnosis and
treatment planning. Most if not all of these patients have
magnetic resonance imaging studies fused to CT-simulation images, allowing for better target delineation. In the
older studies, bony landmarks on plain films were used to
identify the PF; and, in some of those studies, the PF volumes that were irradiated were not adequate. Second, in
patients who receive 3-D conformal RT, doses from 54 to
55.8 Gy are delivered consistently to the TB, which was
not the case for some patients who were treated in the 2-D
RT era, during which the doses were <50 Gy. It is well
established that the primary site needs to receive >50 Gy
for better PF control.19,20 Third, many patients who
receive 3-D conformal RT undergo maximal safe resection. It has been reported that postoperative residual disease >1.5 cm2 in the PF is associated with a worse
outcome.3 Finally, patients who receive conformal RT are
more likely to receive chemotherapy, which was not the
case for some patients in the 2-D RT era.19-22 Chemotherapy may have an impact on improved local control for
patients who are treated in the 3-D conformal RT era.
An IMRT boost to reduce ototoxicity has been used
in our center since 1996. In 2003, we published the initial
results from 15 children who were treated with this
approach, revealing a reduction of POG grade 3 and 4
ototoxicity from 64% down to 13% with conventional
RT and IMRT, respectively.8 A more recent update of
our experience with 44 patients and longer audiogram follow-up revealed POG grade 3 and 4 ototoxicity in 25% of
patients, affecting 18.2% of 88 ears that were tested.24
The median cochlear dose using IMRT was 35.3 Gy for
standard-risk patients and 43.0 Gy for high-risk patients.
One of the potential disadvantages of IMRT is an
increased integral dose, resulting in more dose to the nontarget brain tissue. We have not observed greater declines
in nonverbal intellectual ability, visual-spatial skills, proc-

640

essing speed, or fine motor dexterity with IMRT compared with conventional RT.25
The current findings, together with the Memorial
Hospital, St. Jude, and University of Washington studies,
indicate that volume reduction in the PF from high-dose
RT is feasible. To our knowledge, this article is the first to
describe local control in children who were treated in a series purely with an IMRT boost for medulloblastoma. The
use of IMRT for the boost field in medulloblastoma is
associated with excellent local control. We did not observe
excess marginal disease recurrence with this approach. We
await the results of future studies, which will determine the
appropriate volume to boost in both standard-risk and
high-risk patients with medulloblastoma.
