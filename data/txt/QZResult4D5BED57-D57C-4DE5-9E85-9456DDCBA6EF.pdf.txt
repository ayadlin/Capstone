Abstract
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common form of oral cancer. Destruction and invasion of mandibular and maxillary bone frequently occurs and contributes to morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that
the bisphosphonate drug zoledronic acid (ZOL) would inhibit tumor-induced osteolysis and reduce tumor
growth and invasion in a murine xenograft model of bone-invasive oral SCC (OSCC) derived from an osteolytic
feline OSCC. Luciferase-expressing OSCC cells (SCCF2Luc) were injected into the perimaxillary subgingiva of
nude mice, which were then treated with 100 μg/kg ZOL or vehicle. ZOL treatment reduced tumor growth and
prevented loss of bone volume and surface area but had no effect on tumor invasion. Effects on bone were
associated with reduced osteolysis and increased periosteal new bone formation. ZOL-mediated inhibition
of tumor-induced osteolysis was characterized by reduced numbers of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–
positive osteoclasts at the tumor-bone interface, where it was associated with osteoclast vacuolar degeneration.
The ratio of eroded to total bone surface was not affected by treatment, arguing that ZOL-mediated inhibition
of osteolysis was independent of effects on osteoclast activation or initiation of bone resorption. In summary,
our results establish that ZOL can reduce OSCC-induced osteolysis and may be valuable as an adjuvant therapy
in OSCC to preserve mandibular and maxillary bone volume and function. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8607–16. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Oral and oropharyngeal cancer is the eighth most common
cancer worldwide (1). In 2009, the American Cancer Society
estimated that 35,720 people in the United States would be
diagnosed with cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx and
7,600 people would die (2). Approximately 90% of oral and
oropharyngeal tumors are squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC;
refs. 3, 4). Despite advances in cancer treatment, the 5-year
disease-specific survival for OSCC has shown only moderate
improvement over the past 30 years and is currently 61% for
all stages combined (5). OSCC frequently invades bone (6)
and is characterized by osteoclastic bone resorption (7).
Bone invasion contributes to the clinical morbidity of OSCC
patients and is associated with poorer prognosis (8, 9). Despite the frequency and clinical effect of bone invasion in

OSCC, the mechanisms responsible for bone resorption and
invasion are poorly understood.
We hypothesize that OSCC invasion into bone is facilitated
by a vicious cycle of tumor growth and bone resorption, and
inhibition of the vicious cycle by targeting osteoclastic bone
resorption with zoledrononic acid, a third generation bisphosphonate, will reduce bone loss and tumor growth. The
vicious cycle theory was described in bone metastases of
human breast cancer as a relationship between tumorderived parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and
bone-derived transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1;
ref. 10). OSCC expresses several factors with the potential
to stimulate osteolysis, including PTHrP (11–13), tumor
necrosis factor-α (14), interleukin-6, and interleukin-11 (11).
Regardless of the number and type of bone resorption agonists expressed by OSCC cells, the physical destruction of
bone is accomplished by bone-resorbing osteoclasts.
Osteoclastic bone resorption is inhibited by bisphosphonates. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid (ZOL), interfere with the mevalonate pathway
by inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (15). Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway leads to reduced prenylation
of small GTP-binding proteins responsible for osteoclast
function and survival (16) and leads to apoptosis (17). We
hypothesize that inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption
with ZOL will not only reduce bone loss but will also inhibit
OSCC xenograft growth and invasion by antagonizing the
vicious cycle of osteolysis and tumor growth.

We have designed a novel, bone-invasive, bioluminescent
orthotopic xenograft nude mouse model of OSCC using
PTHrP-expressing cells derived from a bone-invasive feline
OSCC. As in humans, OSCC is the most commonly diagnosed
tumor of the oral cavity in cats (18) and has a highly invasive,
osteolytic phenotype (19) with similarities in clinical progression and pathology compared with human OSCC (20). The
inhibitory activity of ZOL on OSCC growth and tumorassociated osteolysis was investigated using a combination
of in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI), faxitron radiography,
quantitative microcomputed tomography (microCT), and
detailed maxillary histomorphometry. We found that ZOL
may be an effective adjuvant treatment for preventing bone
resorption associated with OSCC.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
SCCF2 cells were originally derived in the authors' laboratory in 2005 from a bone-invasive gingival SCC of a 7-year-old
male castrated cat using methods previously described (21).
The authors authenticated SCCF2 cells as feline malignant
epithelial cells using karyotype analysis, cytokeratin immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy. Formation of
keratinizing SCC xenografts was confirmed in two prior passages (passages 56 and 77; passage 78 was used in this in vivo
study). ZOL (Zometa, Novartis) was purchased from the
James Cancer Center at Ohio State University. ZOL vehicle
was prepared according to the package insert and consisted
of 44 mg/mL mannitol and 4.8 mg/mL sodium citrate in
sterile water.
Transfection of SCCF2 cells with luciferase
SCCF2 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid containing a luciferase–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion
construct driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and
containing neomycin and ampicillin resistance cassettes
[pCDNA3.1(+).yLuc-YFP, kindly provided by C. Contag at
Stanford University] using Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS
Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase-expressing cells were selected with
0.6 mg/mL geneticin (Invitrogen), and luciferase expression
was confirmed using BLI (Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
Animals and treatments
All animals were 6-week-old male nu/nu mice (National
Cancer Institute). Animal care procedures were approved
by the Institutional Lab Animal Care and Use Committee
using criteria based on both Animal Welfare Act and
USPHS's “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.”
Sixty mice were assigned to one of four groups: non–tumorbearing vehicle-treated mice, tumor-bearing vehicle-treated
mice, non–tumor-bearing ZOL-treated mice, and tumorbearing ZOL-treated mice.
General anesthesia of mice was induced and maintained
with inhaled isofluorane. One million (1 × 106) SCCF2Luc
cells in 0.1 mL were injected through the maxillary gingiva in-

8608

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

to the perimaxillary gingival submucosa using a 1-mL syringe
and 26-gauge needle (BD). Non–tumor-bearing mice were
similarly anesthetized and injected with cell-free PBS. This
protocol reliably yields xenograft growth, which invades maxillary and premaxillary bone, and is associated with osteoclastic bone resorption. Treatment was initiated 7 days
following injection of SCCF2Luc cells and consisted of twice
weekly s.c. injections of ZOL at a dose of 100 μg/kg. Nontreated mice received twice weekly injections of vehicle
at the same volume. Two mice met early removal criteria
and were removed from the study (one ZOL-treated,
tumor-bearing mouse and one vehicle-treated, non–tumorbearing mouse). Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation
during isoflurane anesthesia on the 28th day of treatment,
and blood was collected by cardiac puncture for determination of plasma PTHrP and total calcium concentrations.
Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C
for 48 hours, followed by storage in 70% ethanol at 4°C until
histologic processing and evaluation.
BLI
In vivo BLI was performed with the IVIS 100 system as previously described (20). Results were analyzed using LivingImage software, version 2.2 (Caliper Life Sciences). Mice
were injected i.p. with 4.3 mg D-luciferin in sterile PBS and
imaged while under isofluorane anesthesia. A circular region
of interest (ROI) surrounding the xenograft was used to
determine the radiance (photons per second) for each xenograft. Peak ROI radiance was used for comparisons. ROI
radiance was normalized by dividing radiance at days 7, 21,
and 28 by the radiance at day 1.
Faxitron radiography and microCT
The mandible was removed from each skull, and the degree of bone loss was evaluated qualitatively using a Faxitron
cabinet X-ray system (Hewlett-Packard) at 45 kVp for 3.5 minutes. Bone loss was evaluated quantitatively using microCT
(Siemens Inveon Preclinical CT scanner and Inveon Research
Workplace 3-Dimensional Image Software, Siemens AG). Image acquisition, ROI selection, and thresholding values are
provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods. ROI bone
surface area and bone volume were compared between treatment groups.
Histopathology, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
histochemistry, and histomorphometry
The skulls were decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) at 4°C for
14 days. Rostral skull with xenograft tumor was paraffin embedded, sectioned at 5μm, and stained with H&E followed by
microscopic evaluation. Invasiveness was determined by visually identifying tumor cells at the level of the periodontal
ligament of the maxillary incisor and beneath nasal respiratory epithelium. Xenografts were evaluated histologically for
qualitative evidence of necrosis and apoptosis in addition to
overall tumor vascularity. Slides were scanned using the
Aperio ScanScope slide scanner (Aperio). Two-dimensional
tumor area was determined using morphometry tools in
Imagescope software (Aperio). The degree of maxillary bone

loss was determined by comparing maxillary bone area between the non–tumor-bearing side and the tumor-bearing
side for vehicle- and ZOL-treated mice. Maxillary bone was
classified as either preexisting (mature) bone or tumorinduced new bone (immature) based on collagen pattern
(woven or lamellar), osteocyte density, and anatomic location.
Enzymatic histochemistry for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed on tissue sections as previously described (22) and on murine calvarial
bone cocultured with SCCF2 cells in vitro (Supplementary
Materials and Methods). Bone histomorphometry was completed with the Imagescope software. The average percentage
of perimeter of eroded bone, number of active osteoclasts,
and average osteoclast length were compared between treated and untreated tumor-bearing mice. Sections with a minimum of 3 mm of direct tumor-bone interface were included
(13 vehicle-treated mice and 12 ZOL-treated mice).
PTHrP and calcium concentration assays
SCCF2 secretion of PTHrP in vitro (Supplementary Materials
and Methods) and mouse plasma concentrations of PTHrP
were measured using a commercially available two-site immunoradiometric PTHrP (1–86) assay (Diagnostic Systems
Laboratories, Inc.). Plasma calcium concentration was
measured using a commercially available calcium assay kit
(Bioassay Systems). The effect of SCCF2-derived PTHrP on
MC3T3 cell (murine prosteoblast) expression of receptor
activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) was evaluated
in vitro using a previously validated chicken anti-human
PTHrP neutralizing antibody (refs. 23, 24; Supplementary
Materials and Methods).

At the 28th day of treatment, ZOL treatment reduced tumor radiance by 43% (P = 0.0097, two-tailed t test; Fig. 1).
Histomorphometric evaluation of tumor sections revealed
that ZOL treatment reduced tumor area (total area minus
area of central necrosis) by 14% (P = 0.075, two-tailed t test;
data not shown). The greater difference in tumor growth detected with BLI was attributed to the higher specificity of BLI
for viable tumor cells with exclusion of necrotic areas and
stromal elements, in addition to normalization to initial radiance measurements, which corrected for variation in the
number of injected tumor cells.
ZOL reduced loss of bone surface area and volume
Faxitron radiography revealed reduced bone loss and
increased periosteal new bone formation in the region of
xenograft growth in the ZOL-treated mice compared
with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2A). Reconstructed, threedimensional skull images (Fig. 2B) revealed that ZOL treatment reduced, but did not eliminate, loss of bone at the
tumor-bone interface and was accompanied by extensive
bone remodeling with new bone formation. Quantitative
determination of bone volume and surface area was performed on a 2-mm-thick maxillary ROI (Fig. 2C). Xenograft
growth in vehicle-treated mice reduced bone surface
area by 14% (P < 0.0001, ANOVA) and bone volume by
19% (P < 0.0001, ANOVA; Fig. 3). There was no statistically
significant loss of bone surface area and volume in ZOLtreated, tumor-bearing mice compared with non–tumorbearing mice. ZOL treatment increased bone surface area
and bone volume in tumor-bearing mice by 23% and 39%,
respectively (P < 0.0001, ANOVA) compared with untreated
tumor-bearing mice.

Statistical analysis
Results were displayed as means ± SEM. Normality was determined with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed,
continuous data were analyzed using Student's t test, and
multiple group comparisons were made by one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. In the event the data
were not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon rank-sum (MannWhitney) test was performed. Data with P values of <0.05
were considered statistically significant. When multiple comparisons were made within a data set (maxillary histomorphometry), the P value of 0.05 divided by the number of
comparisons (7) was accepted as significant (P = 0.007).
Categorical data (presence of invasion) were analyzed using
Fisher's exact test. All analyses were performed with STATA
intercooled 10 software.

Results
ZOL treatment reduced tumor growth
Bioluminescent signal was detectable in all mice at all time
points, with no initial difference between vehicle- and ZOLtreated groups. Tumor formation became visibly evident as
mild facial swelling at 7 to 14 days after injection of tumor
cells. Gross tumor formation occurred in all mice, which was
located at the junction of maxillary and premaxillary bone on
the lateral aspect of the skull.

(minimal exposure of incisor root, black circle) and increased periosteal new bone formation. C, a 2-mm-thick ROI was selected (gray band), allowing bone
surface area and volume to be calculated and compared between treatment groups.

loss and induced osteoclast degeneration but did not

SCCF2Luc xenografts were composed of islands and trabeculae of malignant epithelial cells showing variable degrees
of squamous differentiation and keratinization with regions
of central necrosis. There was no difference in xenograft
cellular morphology between vehicle- and ZOL-treated mice.
SCCF2Luc xenografts were poorly vascularized; however,
vessels seemed slightly more numerous and larger at the
tumor-bone interface and were associated with larger aggregates of tumor cells. This pattern was observed in mice of
both vehicle- and ZOL-treated groups.
SCCF2 cells induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S1), and SCCF2Luc
xenografts were associated with marked osteolysis of premaxillary and maxillary bone (Fig. 4A). ZOL inhibited

osteoclast formation and bone loss in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. S1) and in vivo (Fig. 4B). Despite reduced bone loss,
ZOL had no effect on tumor invasion (Fig. 4A and B).
Tumor invasion around the maxillary incisor was observed
in 13 of 15 vehicle-treated mice and 12 of 14 ZOL-treated
mice. Tumor invasion into the nasal passage was observed
in 12 of 15 vehicle-treated mice and in 10 of 14 ZOL-treated
mice.
Nine of 14 tumor-bearing, ZOL-treated mice had foci of
bone necrosis within xenografts, and six of these mice also
showed necrosis of the maxillary incisor pulp cavity. Bone
necrosis was often located in regions of tumor necrosis
and only occurred in mice with pronounced tumor invasion.
Bone and tooth necrosis was not observed on the non–
tumor-bearing side of the maxilla and was not observed in
ZOL-treated, non–tumor-bearing mice. No vehicle-treated
mice had evidence of tooth necrosis, although 1 of 15

vehicle-treated tumor-bearing mice had evidence of bone
necrosis.
TRAP-positive osteoclasts were observed at the tumorbone interface in treated and untreated mice; however,
osteoclasts in ZOL-treated mice (Fig. 4D) had variable
degrees of cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration (numerous,
variably sized, circular, clear cytoplasmic vacuoles) compared with those in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4C).
Zolecronic acid reduced loss of maxillary bone area
and resulted in fewer osteoclasts
Maxillary bone area was determined using Imagescope
software (Fig. 5A). There was no difference in total bone area
on the non–tumor-bearing side of vehicle- and ZOL-treated
mice. Xenograft growth was associated with a 48% reduction
in total bone area (preexisting bone and new bone com-

bined) compared with the non–tumor-bearing side (P =
0.0002, Wilcoxon rank-sum), whereas ZOL treatment prevented loss of total bone area. Xenograft growth was associated with a 64% reduction in preexisting bone (P = 0.0003,
Wilcoxon rank-sum) in vehicle-treated mice compared with
a 33% reduction in preexisting bone in ZOL-treated mice (P =
0.0002, two-tailed t test). ZOL-treated mice retained 2-fold
more total bone compared with vehicle-treated mice (P =
0.0004, Wilcoxon rank-sum), and 2-fold more preexisting
bone compared with vehicle-treated mice (P = 0.005, Wilcoxon
rank-sum). P values of <0.007 were considered statistically
significant (adjusted for multiple comparisons). The preservation of total bone in ZOL-treated mice, as detected by microCT and histomorphometry, was attributed to reduced loss
of preexisting bone and increased new bone formation.
Activated osteoclasts at the xenograft-bone interface were
detected using TRAP histochemistry. There was no statistically significant difference in the ratio of eroded to total bone
surface between ZOL- and vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5B);
however, ZOL reduced the number of osteoclasts per millimeter of bone surface by 52% (P = 0.0003, two-tailed t test).
The average osteoclast length was increased in ZOL-treated
mice by 39% (P = 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum).
Plasma PTHrP was increased in tumor-bearing mice
SCCF2 cells secreted PTHrP in vitro (Fig. 6B), and
SCCF2Luc xenograft growth resulted in elevated plasma
PTHrP in vivo (Fig. 6A). Tumor-bearing mice (n = 12) had a
2.7-fold increase (P = 0.037, ANOVA) in plasma PTHrP (0.65
pmol/L versus 2.42 pmol/L) compared with non–tumorbearing control mice (n = 5). ZOL treatment resulted in a
nonstatistically significant, 20% reduction in plasma PTHrP
in tumor-bearing mice. Elevated plasma PTHrP in tumorbearing mice was not associated with hypercalcemia (Fig. 6A).
SCCF2 cells secreted PTHrP into conditioned medium, and
addition of bone-conditioned medium to SCCF2 cultures
increased SCCF2 secretion of PTHrP (Fig. 6B). SCCF2 conditioned medium stimulated expression of RANKL in MC3T3
cells (a murine preosteoblast cell line; Supplementary
Fig. S2) but did not have a significant effect on MC3T3
expression of osteoprotegerin (data not shown). Neutralization of SCCF2-derived PTHrP in conditioned medium with a
neutralizing antibody inhibited the expression of RANKL in
MC3T3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Discussion

non–tumor-bearing mice. ZOL prevented loss of bone surface area and
bone volume. ZOL treatment increased bone surface area and

There are few preclinical, in vivo models that recapitulate
the bone invasive behavior of OSCC. In vivo OSCC studies
have been reported using two osteolytic OSCC cell lines:
BHY, derived from a human gingival OSCC (25), and SCCVII,
derived from a C(3)H/HeN mouse OSCC from ventral mouth
(26, 27). Other cell lines showing variable bone invasion
in vivo include UMSCC1 (28), UMSCC11A, UMSCC11B (29),
BICR31, BICR56 (30), and HSC3 (12). We have designed a

ZOL treatment reduced tumor growth and bone loss in the
SCCF2Luc xenograft model and was associated with a reduced number of activated osteoclasts at the tumor-bone
interface. These results are similar to those reported by Cui
and colleagues (2005), who showed that a third generation
bisphosphonate (YM529, minodronic acid) reduced osteoclast number and tumor growth in the SCCVII syngeneic

mouse model of bone invasive OSCC (26). In contrast to our
study, Cui and colleagues injected SCCVII cells percutaneously into the masseter muscle adjacent to the mandible
rather than orthotopically into the oral submucosa, and they
did not quantify the effects of YM529 treatment on tumorinduced bone loss. The addition of complete histomorphometric characterization of bone loss in our study not only
corroborated the subjective and objective findings of the radiographic and microCT examination but showed the effect
of ZOL treatment on preexisting bone independent of periosteal new bone formation.
There are several possible mechanisms for reduced osteoclastic bone resorption in the ZOL-treated mice. ZOL inhibits
osteoclastic bone resorption by inducing osteoclast apoptosis
through impaired prenylation of small GTPases as a result of
farnesyl transferase inhibition (31), accumulation of unprenylated small GTPases in their active state with inappropriate
activation of downstream signaling pathways, and the induction of an ATP analogue, which induces direct apoptosis (32).
Additionally, ZOL has also been shown to increase the in vitro
expression of the osteoclast inhibitor osteoprotegerin in human osteoblasts (33). Our study revealed that osteoclasts in
ZOL-treated mice continued to form and maintained their
ability to resorb bone but existed in reduced numbers and
showed evidence of vacuolar degeneration. The mechanism
of the vacuolar degeneration is not known; however, a study
by Coxon and colleagues showed that targeted inhibition of
the small GTPase Rab resulted in reduced osteoclast function

accompanied by dome-shaped cell morphology and large
intracellular vacuoles, which was attributed to disruption of
Rab-dependent intracellular membrane trafficking in osteoclasts (34). In our study, accumulation of numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles may have contributed to the increased osteoclast
diameter (length) observed in the ZOL-treated mice.
ZOL significantly reduced, but did not completely inhibit,
bone resorption in this model of bone-invasive OSCC. Interestingly, tumor-bearing mice continued to lose preexisting
bone during ZOL therapy, albeit at a reduced level, and
showed increased periosteal new bone formation. This may
be explained by differential affinity of ZOL for different bone
surfaces. ZOL is reported to be incorporated more readily into bone, as it is being formed by osteoblasts and into bone
exposed by osteoclast activity compared with quiescent bone
surfaces (31). Periosteal new bone formation would be relatively spared from bone resorption because of the higher levels of ZOL expected to be incorporated into the matrix as it
is formed (31). ZOL treatment did not totally eliminate the
presence of osteoclasts; therefore, it seems that osteoclasts
in the tumor-bone microenvironment are at least partially
protected from the proapoptotic effects of ZOL. Interestingly,
a recent in vitro study revealed that a human OSCC cell line
was capable of reducing osteoclast apoptosis through downregulation of the proapoptotic factor Bim in osteoclasts (35).
ZOL has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in other
models through direct antineoplastic mechanisms, which
include inhibition of cancer cell adhesion, invasion, viability,

rank-sum) and 2-fold more
preexisiting bone compared with
vehicle-treated mice (*, P = 0.005).
B, histomorphometric evaluation of
TRAP-stained sections revealed
no difference in the percentage of
eroded bone between ZOL- and
vehicle-treated mice; however,
ZOL reduced the number of
osteoclasts per millimeter by 52%
(*, P = 0.0003). The average
osteoclast length was increased in
the ZOL-treated mice by 39%
(*, P = 0.0001).

Figure 6. PTHrP was increased in mice bearing SCCF2Luc xenografts
and in conditioned medium of SCCF2 cells grown in bone-conditioned
medium. A, plasma PTHrP was increased in tumor-bearing mice
(2.42 pmol/L) compared with control mice (0.65 pmol/L; *, P = 0.037);
however, ZOL treatment did not significantly reduce plasma PTHrP
concentrations (NS, not significant). Xenograft growth and ZOL treatment
had no effect on plasma calcium compared with control mice. B, SCCF2
cells secreted PTHrP into the culture medium (n = 3). Culture of
SCCF2 cells in bone-conditioned medium increased PTHrP secretion at
2.6-fold (*, P < 0.05).

and angiogenesis (36, 37). For example, the antiangiogenic
activity of bisphosphonates is associated with reduced circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in humans
with metastatic bone disease (38) and in cats with OSCC (39).
There was no histologic evidence of an antiangiogenic effect
of ZOL treatment in this study. Although a proapoptotic
activity of ZOL in tumor cells has been shown in human cell
lines (40, 41), evaluation of ZOL-treated SCCF2Luc tumors
did not reveal microscopic evidence of increased necrosis
or apoptosis. The complex pharmacokinetics of ZOL in the
bone microenvironment pose significant challenges to in vitro
studies attempting to model the exposure of tumor cells to
clinically relevant concentrations of ZOL and make comparisons of in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity difficult.

It is likely that ZOL-mediated inhibition of osteoclastic
bone resorption contributed to reduced xenograft growth
in this model. Culture of SCCF2 cells in bone-conditioned
medium stimulated PTHrP secretion in vitro, and SCCF2derived PTHrP stimulated murine presteoblast expression
of RANKL. ZOL showed in vitro and in vivo inhibition of
SCCF2-associated bone resorption. Interestingly, ZOL treatment reduced the average plasma PTHrP concentration in
tumor-bearing mice by 20%, although statistical significance
was not reached. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo data
support the role of tumor-derived PTHrP in a vicious cycle of
OSCC growth and osteoclastic bone resorption. Bone-derived
factors that may have stimulated SCCF2 expression of PTHrP
include TGF-β, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth
factors IGF-I and IGF-II, platelet-derived growth factor, and
bone morphogenic proteins (42). By reducing osteoclastic
bone resorption, ZOL has the potential to reduce the liberation of stored growth factors, making a less favorable environment for the growth of tumor cells (33).
OSCC expression of PTHrP influences in vitro tumor cell
proliferation, migration, and invasiveness (43) and participates in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by increasing
stromal cell expression of RANKL (12). A small subset of
OSCC patients experienced hypercalcemia with increased
serum PTHrP concentration (44). Plasma PTHrP concentrations were increased in mice bearing SCCF2Luc xenografts. Although there was no evidence of a humoral role
of PTHrP in this model (lack of hypercalcemia), it is likely
that tumor-derived PTHrP in the xenograft-bone microenvironment functioned in a paracrine manner to stimulate
osteoclastic bone resorption by increasing RANKL expression in osteoblasts.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is occasionally observed
in cancer patients receiving aminobisphosphonate therapy
(estimated incidence of 5–10%; ref. 45) and is characterized
by exposure of mandibular or maxillary bone, which fails to
heal over a period of 6 to 8 weeks (46). In this study, ZOL was
well tolerated in both the tumor-bearing and non–tumorbearing mice, and there was no evidence of ONJ. The presence of tumor-associated necrotic bone within xenografts
of ZOL-treated mice was attributed to the retention of bone
undergoing necrosis as a result of tumor infiltration. Bone
necrosis would be expected in the vehicle-treated mice as
well; however, the robust osteoclastic response in vehicletreated mice would have removed necrotic bone as it developed. The cause of tooth necrosis in ZOL-treated mice was
not evident but seemed as an extension of bone necrosis and
occurred in mice that showed tumor infiltration near the
base of the tooth root. It is possible that OSCC patients with
existing bone disease of the mandible or maxilla may be at
increased risk for the development of ONJ; however, the
potential benefits of protecting bone volume and function
in cases of nonresectable, bone-invasive cancer may outweigh the risks in some patients.
ZOL inhibited OSCC-induced osteolysis and reduced tumor growth in this xenograft mouse model; however, the
presence of invasion was unchanged. The results of this experiment suggest that ZOL would be valuable as an adjunct

therapy with the purpose of maintaining mandibular and
maxillary bone volume and function, particularly if combined
with antineoplastic agents capable of reducing tumor invasion. We have provided evidence supporting the role of
OSCC-derived PTHrP in a vicious cycle of tumor growth
and bone resorption during OSCC progression. Further studies are required to characterize the factors released from
bone, which stimulate OSCC growth and PTHrP secretion,
and to determine if ZOL may provide an additive or synergistic antitumor effect when combined with other therapeutic
modalities for the treatment of bone invasive OSCC.
