ABSTRACT
Drosophila homologue of Diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1) regulates actin polymerization
and microtubule (MT) stabilization upon stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid
(LPA). Recently, we showed strongly reduced lung metastasis of DIAPH1-depleted
colon cancer cells but we found accumulations of DIAPH1-depleted cells in bone
marrow. Here, we analyzed possible organ- or tissue-specific metastasis of DIAPH1depleted HCT-116 cells. Our data confirmed that depletion of DIAPH1 strongly
inhibited lung metastasis and revealed that, in contrast to control cells, DIAPH1depleted cells did not form metastases in further organs. Detailed mechanistic
analysis on cells that were not stimulated with LPA to activate the cytoskeletonmodulating activity of DIAPH1, revealed that even under basal conditions DIAPH1
was essential for cellular adhesion to collagen. In non-stimulated cells DIAPH1
did not control actin dynamics but, interestingly, was essential for stabilization of
microtubules (MTs). Additionally, DIAPH1 controlled directed vesicle trafficking
and with this, local clustering of the adhesion protein integrin-β1 at the plasma
membrane. Therefore, we conclude that under non-stimulating conditions DIAPH1
controls cellular adhesion by stabilizing MTs required for local clustering of
integrin-β1 at the plasma membrane. Thus, blockade of DIAPH1-tubulin interaction
may be a promising approach to inhibit one of the earliest steps in the metastatic
cascade of colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

for formation of filopodia and invadopodia, for vesicle
trafficking and for spindle formation [5]. In immune-cells
these activities are required for cell motility during defense
of infection and also tumor cells with ectopic expression
of DIAPH1 show increased cell motility and invasion
[4]. However, the relationship between its regulatory
role in both, actin polymerization and MT stabilization,
still remains elusive. Recently, we found DIAPH1
being specifically up-regulated in patient samples from
colorectal carcinomas and found a positive correlation
between DIAPH1 expression and the presence of colon
cancer metastasis. In addition, we demonstrated that
down-regulation of DIAPH1 in the three coloncarcinoma
cell lines lines HCT-116, HT-29 and HROC-24,
significantly decreased in vitro adhesion, invasion and
migration. This insight of its metastasis-promoting
activity in colon cancer cells was additionally confirmed
by a subcutaneous SCID mouse model, showing that
lung metastasis of HCT-116 cells was almost completely
blocked after depletion of DIAPH1. However, since we
have detected an accumulation of DIAPH1-depleted
cells in bone marrow aspirates of SCID mice, we could
not exclude that DIAPH1 depletion promotes metastatic
outgrowth in organs other than lung [20].
Different from other studies showing DIAPH1mediated cytoskeletal effects upon lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) stimulation [18, 19], our previous studies
were all based on non-stimulated cells [20]. LPA mainly
accumulates at sites of wound healing, where it is required
for platelet activation and for stimulation of endothelial
stress fiber formation [21]. Moreover, LPA recruits tumor
cells to the sites of wound healing where tumor cell
invasion into the adjacent tissue is facilitated [22] and
LPA increases vascular permeability of endothelial cells
during tumor cell extravasation [23]. According to our
previous data, DIAPH1 showed to be essential for colon
cancer metastasis, though not specifically stimulated with
LPA.19 Therefore, we have outlined two objectives in
this study: 1. we aimed to determine whether DIAPH1depleted human colon cancer cells show organ- or
tissue- specific metastases besides the lungs. 2. We aimed
to analyze DIAPH1-effects on cellular adhesion and
cytoskeletal dynamics in colon cancer cells that were not
specifically stimulated with LPA.

In mammalian cells three different isoforms
of DIAPH (Drosophila homologue of Diaphanous;
DIAPH1–3) have been identified [1–3]. DIAPH belongs
to a group of actin regulatory proteins, which are defined
by the presence of formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin
homology 2 (FH2) domains, with intrinsic and conserved
functions regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. In particular,
the DIAPH isoform 1 (DIAPH1) has become subject
of intense research. Over the past few years, DIAPH1
has been recognized as a key molecule controlling a
large variety of cellular and morphogenetic functions in
physiological, as well as pathological settings [4, 5]. Under
physiological conditions DIAPH1 is mainly expressed in
immune cells [6], but up-regulated expression has also
been found in many cancer diseases [5, 7–11].
Functionally, DIAPH1 stimulates linear actin
polymerization by binding F-actin by its FH2 and
profilin/G-actin by its FH1 domains. The FH2 domains
dimerize in order to associate with and cap the barbed
end of an actin filament, preventing binding of capping
proteins [12]. The FH1-domains recruit G-actin to
the growing barbed end, resulting in polarized linear
elongation of an actin filament. However, when cells are
not specifically stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid
(LPA), the auto inhibitory interaction of DID (Diaphanous
inhibitory domain) and DAD (Diaphanous auto inhibitory
domain) domain attenuate binding of actin to the FH1/
FH2 domains. After binding of LPA to its G-protein
coupled receptor, RhoA is activated and binds to the
GTPase binding domain (GBD), the association of the
inhibitory domains with GBD disrupts, thus releasing the
FH1 and FH2 domains for binding with actin [13, 14].
Besides directly modulating the cytoskeleton, activated
DIAPH1 has also transcriptional consequences by
regulating the Serum Response Factor (SRF). For full
activation, SRF must be associated with its co-activator
myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A),
which is sequestered in the cytoplasm via interaction with
G-actin. DIAPH1-mediated decrease of cellular G-actin
causes the co-activator to translocate from the cytoplasm
into the  nucleus, where it activates SRF-dependent
transcription. Thus, DIAPH1-mediated decrease of
cellular G-actin concentration leads to the induction and
up-regulation of SRF target genes, of which many appears
to be essential for cell adhesion and spreading [15, 16].
In addition to its actin-modulating activity, DIAPH1
binds to and regulates the selective stabilization of
microtubules (MTs) via its FH2 domains [17]. In vitro,
DIAPH1 alone is sufficient to stabilize MTs, in vivo it
functions as a scaffold protein with the tumor suppressor
Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) and Endbinding
protein 1 (EB1), stabilizing MTs as a complex [18, 19].
Based on these different  properties, DIAPH1 regulates
many actin and tubulin-driven cellular effects: It is essential

RESULTS
DIAPH1 is essential for metastasis of colon
cancer cells in SCID mice
Recently we have revealed that depletion of DIAPH1
in colon cancer cells (HCT-116 cells) strongly reduced lung
metastasis in SCID mice [20]. However, we also found
that the number of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in
bone marrow was 4-fold higher in DIAHP1-depleted cells
compared to the control. Thus, we could not exclude that

DIAPH1 depletion promotes the formation of metastases in
the bone marrow or other distant organs outside the lungs.
Based on this consideration, here we analyzed HCT-116
control and DIAHP1-depleted HCT-116 cells (termed as
D5 cells, see [20]) cells stably expressing luciferase regarding
their dissemination in SCID mice by bioluminescence
imaging (BLI). At injection, D5  cells  exhibited an about
60% down-regulation of DIAPH1 (Figure S1).
We found that all mice injected with control cells
developed subcutaneous primary tumors, which were
dissected after a mean period of 42 days after injection. After

surgery, metastasis development could be monitored by BLI
for another 40 days. After this period, BLI analysis revealed
strong signals at different distant locations such as the
lungs, livers, or soft tissues adjacent to bones. Histological
examinations of these samples verified the presence of large
lung metastases and tumor cell deposits surrounded by
murine skeletal muscles, respectively, in the control group
(Figure 1, left panel; metastasis are marked with “M”).
Lung metastases were macroscopically visible and Alu-PCR
analysis revealed an accumulation of an average of one
million colon cancer cells in the lungs (Table 1).

Figure 1: Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of spontaneous metastasis formation after surgical resection of primary
tumors. SCID mice injected with luciferase-over-expressing HCT-116 scrambled control and DIAPH1-depleted (D5) cells developed
subcutaneous primary tumors of about 1.5 cm3 within 42 days in 100% and 71% of mice, respectively. Primary tumors were surgically
resected and metastasis formation was monitored for another 40 to 44 days after surgery by regularly performed BLI. A. After this
period, 100% of control mice revealed strong BLI signals mostly in the lungs (upper panel) and in the livers (lower panel). Histological
examinations of H.E.-stained lung sections verified the presence of large pulmonary metastases (M) B. In the D5 group, spontaneous bone
marrow metastases as expected from our previous study could not be detected after this period of postoperative monitoring. In contrast,
only one mouse of the D5 group showed a rather diffuse BLI signal above the right scapula, which could not be verified by histology.
Corresponding H.E.-stained serial sections showed large, tumor cell-free muscular tissues and an adjacent bone, presumably scapula
(arrow). The corresponding BLI signal was therefore most likely due to relapsing subcutaneous primary tumor cells.

Dependence on adhesion of HCT-116
cells on DIAPH1 expression and on
cytoskeletal dynamics

In contrast, five of the seven mice injected with D5
cells formed tumors and were monitored by BLI for up
to 44 days after dissection of the primary tumors. In this
group, only one mouse showed a luciferase signal located
in the soft tissue of the neck region at the end of the
experiment. Histological examinations of corresponding
sections did not reveal any metastatic cells (Figure 1B,
right panel) so that the BLI signal was most likely due
to recurrent primary tumor cells in this area. Alu-PCR
confirmed that the number of DTc in the lungs of mice
that received D5 cells was drastically reduced (by 99.95%;
Table 1). In accordance with our previous data, the number
of D5 cells in the bone marrow was 6-fold higher than
that of control cells (Table 1). However, as we did not
find any BLI signals in the skeleton of D5 mice after
surgery, the accumulation of DIAPH1-depleted cells in
the bone marrow as indicated by Alu-PCR was obviously
not accompanied by an increased outgrowth of clinically
detectable bone marrow metastases.
Summarized, these results confirm that depletion
of DIAPH1 strongly reduces lung metastasis of HCT-116
cells and reveal that DIAPH1 knock down cells are not
able to form metastasis outside the lungs.

Since our previous data, showing significant effects
of DIAPH1 on the metastatic potential of colon cancer
metastasis in vitro and in vivo, were not based on LPA
stimulation, one main goal of this study was to analyze
DIAPH1-mediated cellular effects on non-stimulated
HCT-116 colon cancer cells more closely. Since adhesion
to the substrate is one of the earliest steps of tumor cell
metastasis, we analyzed the effect of DIAPH1-depletion
on early cell adhesion on collagen (two hours after
seeding) of non-stimulated HCT-116 cells.
We found, indeed, that even under non-stimulating
conditions, depletion of DIAPH1 reduced adhesion
of HCT-116 colon cancer cells to collagen by 50%
(Figure 2A). As in absence of LPA-stimulation the actinnucleating activity of DIAPH1 is blocked [19], it was
unlikely that the formin controls cellular adhesion by
its actin-nucleating activity. To analyze this assumption,
actin and also tubulin dynamics were blocked by treating
scrambled HCT-116 control cells with cytochalasin  B

described in A. Mean values ± SD as percent of control or as percent of non-treated control cells of four independent experiments are

or with nocodazole. Thereafter, early adhesion was
compared between non-treated and treated cells. Trypan
blue analysis showed that these treatments did not
affect viability of HCT-116 cells (data not shown).
Our data show that treatment with cytochalasin B did
not affect adhesion while treatment with nocodazole
significantly inhibited adhesion of HCT-116 scrambled
cells by 42  ±  11% (Figure  2B). This result confirms
our assumption that under non-stimulating conditions
DIAPH1 does not control adhesion by it actin-nucleating
activity. Since on the other hand adhesion was blocked in
response to destabilization of MTs, it is very likely that the
MT-stabilizing effect of DIAPH1 accounts for DIAPH1controlled cellular adhesion.

analyzed the effect of DIAPH1 on cytoskeletal dynamics
in non-stimulated HCT-116 cells.
First, we analyzed the interaction of DIAPH1
with microtubules or with actin in non-stimulated
HCT-116 cells. For this purpose, tubulin and actin
were immunoprecipitated from HCT-116 control cell
(ctrl) lysates and binding of DIAPH1 to tubulin and
actin was analyzed by Western blotting. In addition,
immunoprecipitates from lysates of HCT-116 DIAPH1
knock down cells (D4) were used as negative control. As
shown in Figure 3A, DIAPH1 was clearly detectable in
tubulin and actin-coupled beads incubated with cell lysates
from control cells, whereas no signal was detected when
the beads where incubated with cell lysates from DIAPH1
knock down cells. Thus, also in non-stimulated HCT-116
cells DIAPH1 seems to interact with both cytoskeletal
elements. To verify this result, co-localization studies
between DIAPH1 with tubulin or actin in HCT-116
control cells were performed. This evaluation revealed that
DIAPH1 is homogeneously distributed all over the cell and
partly co-localizes with tubulin and with actin (Figure 3B).
From these data we conclude that, although HCT-116
cells were not specifically stimulated, DIAPH1 partially
interacts with both, tubulin and actin in HCT-116 cells.

DIAPH1 is associated with both actin
and MTs in HCT-116 cells under
non-stimulating conditions
Our assumption that DIAPH1 controls adhesion
of non-stimulated HCT-116 colon cancer cells by
stabilizing MTs had to be proven because up to now the
MT-stabilizing effect of DIAPH1 was only shown after
preventing its auto-inhibition [18, 19]. Thus, we next

DIAPH1 controls microtubule but not actin
dynamics in non-stimulated HCT-116 cells

First, we analyzed if spreading and clustering
of integrin-β1 at FAs is only dependent on tubulin or
also  on actin dynamics by nocodazole- or cytochalasin
B-treatment of control HCT-116 cells, respectively. Our
data showed that spreading was dependent on both,
tubulin and actin dynamics, while clustering of integrin-β1
at adhesion sites was only dependent on MT dynamics
(Figure 5A). On the other hand, depletion of DIAPH1
reduced spreading as well as translocation of integrin-β1
to FA (Figure 5B, 5C).
To analyze the impact of DIAPH1 on vesicle
trafficking, BDNF-vesicle trafficking was analyzed and
served as representative for general vesicle trafficking in
HCT-116 cells. Four measurement categories were defined
beforehand: 1. number of bidirectionally moving vesicles,
2. vesicle accumulations per cell (defined by at least
3 closely located vesicles), 3. number of linearly moving
vesicles per cell and 4. track length of vesicles with linear
movement. The data revealed that the percentage of
bidirectionally moving vesicles per cell and the percentage
of vesicle accumulations per cell were both increased
about 2-fold in DIAPH1 knock down cells. Instead, the
percentage of cells with linearly moving vesicles was
decreased 9-fold and the average track length of linearly
moving vesicles (shown as % of whole cell length) was
decreased 2-fold in DIAPH1 knock down cells (Table 3).
To show if BDNF-trafficking is only dependent on
microtubules or also on actin dynamics, scrambled control
cells were treated with nocodazole or cytochalasin B.
Nocodazole-treated scrambled cells showed comparable
vesicle trafficking phenotype to DIAPH1 knock down
cells, whereas cytochalasin B treatment caused no effect on
BDNF-trafficking and was similar to that of DMSO control
cells (Table 3). In conclusion, these data show that in nonstimulated HCT-116 cells directed vesicle trafficking is
only dependent on tubulin but not on actin dynamics and
reveal that depletion of DIAPH1 exhibits the same effect
on vesicle trafficking as destabilization of MTs.
In summary, these data demonstrate that vesicle
trafficking and clustering of integrin-β1 at FA were only
dependent on tubulin while cell spreading was dependent
on both, actin and tubulin dynamics. Overall, our data
show that adhesion of non-stimulated HCT-116 cells
is dependent on DIAPH1-mediated MT-stabilization.
Furthermore, we show that DIAPH1 is essential to
stabilize MTs, which are required for directed vesicle
trafficking and translocation of integrin-β1 to FAs.

To show if the partial localization of DIAPH1 to
actin and to tubulin in non-stimulated HCT-116 cells has
an impact on cytoskeletal dynamics, we analyzed the
G- to F-actin ratio, the fluorescence-signals of phalloidinstained actin filaments and tubulin dynamics in control
and DIAPH1-depleted cells. The G- to F-actin ratio was
analyzed by the well-established DNAse-assay [24] and
tubulin dynamics by quantification of detyrosinated (thus
stabilized) microtubules.
We found no significant differences in the G- to
F-actin ratio between control and DIAPH1-depleted cells
(Table 2) and also fluorescence-signals of phalloidinstained actin filaments were not significantly different
between these cell lines (Figure S2). However, a
significant reduction of detyrosinated MTs in DIAPH1
knock down cells was observed (Figure 4A). In order
to exclude this observation being due to general MT
disintegration in DIAPH1-depleted cells, we further
analyzed MT dynamics of the cells. For that purpose the
velocity of growing microtubule plus tips was measured.
Cells were transfected with EGFP-tagged end binding
protein 3 (EB3), which labels MT growing plus ends [25].
Live cell imaging of EB3-labeled microtubules revealed
that velocity of MT growing ends was doubled in DIAPH1
knock down cells (Figure 4B). Thus, although in nonstimulated HCT-116 cells DIAPH1 partially localizes to
actin and to tubulin, its depletion only significantly affects
the modulation of microtubules.

DIAPH1 controls MT-dependent cell adhesion
processes in HCT-116 cells
Our data that under non-stimulating conditions
DIAPH1 is required to stabilize MTs together with the
finding that adhesion of HCT-116 cells depends on tubulin
dynamics, further supports our presumption that DIAPH1
controls adhesion of HCT-116 cells by its MT-stabilizing
activity. As a further verification that DIAPH1 controls
adhesion by stabilizing MTs, we examined if DIAPH1 is
essential for MT-dependent adhesion processes. For this
purpose, we compared cell spreading, clustering of the
main focal adhesion protein integrin-β1 at focal adhesion
like structures (FA) [26], and vesicle trafficking of control
and DIAPH1-depleted cells.

Based on these results, we conclude that nonstimulated DIAPH1 is sufficient to control translocation
of the main focal adhesion protein integrin-β1 to the cell
surface, which explains impaired cell adhesion and thus
reduced metastasis of DIAPH1-depleted HCT-116 cells.

of the earliest steps of metastasis is the adherence of tumor
cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or the vascular
endothelium, in order to escape from the primary tumor to
invade surrounding blood vessels, or to extravasate from
blood vessels to set distant metastasis [29].
In this study, we confirmed our recent finding [20]
that reduction of DIAPH1 expression strongly inhibited
lung metastasis of HCT-116 cells in a subcutaneous SCID
mouse model. Our data showed that knock down of
DIAPH1 expression reduced lung metastasis by 99.95%,
whereby lung metastasis was only detected in one out
of six mice injected with DIAPH1-depleted cells. In
addition, we confirmed accumulation of DIAPH1 knock
down cells in bone marrow, which led us to assume that

DIAPH1-depleted cells might form bone metastasis.
However, in mice injected with DIAPH1 knock down
cells, no metastasis outside the lungs were detected,
indicating that the cells accumulated in blood vessels of
bone marrow. The finding, that DIAPH1-depleted cells are
not able to leave the blood vessels, shows that, in addition
to invasion, also extravasation is impaired in DIAPH1
knock down HCT-116 cells.
Mechanistically, the strong effect of DIAPH1
depletion on metastasis of colon cancer cells can be
explained by our result that DIAPH1 is essential for one
of the earliest steps in the metastatic cascade; cellular
adhesion to the ECM. Interestingly, our data showed that
this process was controlled by DIAPH1 even without LPAstimulation. This result was surprising because in absence
of LPA-mediated stimulation of RhoA, DIAPH1 is in its
auto-inhibited form, preventing FH1 and FH2 interplay
required for actin nucleation [18, 19]. However, our data
showed that DIAPH1 partially interacts with both, tubulin
and actin in HCT-116 cells but we revealed that depletion
of DIAPH1 did not affect actin dynamics of HCT-116
cells in absence of LPA stimulation which confirmed that
DIAPH1 did not significantly stimulate the production of
F-actin under these conditions. This observation, together
with our finding that inhibition of actin dynamics by
cytochalasin B did not affect adhesion of non-stimulated
HCT-116 colon cancer cells, strongly indicate that
DIAPH1-controlled cellular adhesion was not mediated
by the actin-nucleating activity of DIAPH1. On the other
hand, we found that knock down of DIAPH1-expression
significantly impaired MT-stabilization in non-stimulated
HCT-116 cells, indicating that FH2-mediated stabilization
of MTs also works in the auto-inhibited state of DIAPH1.
Additionally, we show that in non-stimulating HCT-116
cells vesicle trafficking and translocation of integrin-β1 to
FAs were dependent on DIAPH1 expression and on stable
MTs but not on actin dynamics. As integrin-β1 directly
binds ECM proteins, it mediated anchorage of tumor
cells to the substrate and thus is essential to initiate and
to stabilize cellular adhesion [26, 30, 31]. Accordingly,
decreased clustering of integrin-β1 at the plasma
membrane impairs cellular adhesion. Based on these
considerations, we conclude that reduced adhesion of nonstimulated DIAPH1-depleted HCT-116 cells at least in
part results from impaired focal clustering of integrin-β1.
In summary our data demonstrate that also in absence of
LPA stimulation, DIAPH1 is essential for MT-dependent
cellular adhesion of HCT-116 colon cancer cells, thus
facilitates one of the first steps in the metastatic cascade.
LPA-stimulation may enhance this effect by additionally
activating the actin nucleating activity of DIAPH1 to
stimulate formation of cellular protrusion required for
tumor cell invasion [29].
To our knowledge this is the first study showing
that even under basal conditions DIAPH1 is required for
stable MT-dependent metastasis of colon cancer cells.

Accordingly, we suggest a direct interaction between the
FH2 domain of DIAPH1 and tubulin, even being in its
auto-inhibited state. However, it leaves future studies to
reveal whether this assumption proves true on a molecular
level, or whether other factors besides LPA also play a
regulative role in DIAPH1-mediated MT-stabilization in
non-stimulated colon cancer cells. Since the FH2 domain
is essential for all known DIAPH1-mediated cellular
effects, identification of drugs specifically blocking the
interaction of FH2 with tubulin and actin, respectively,
may be a promising new therapeutic approach for
metastasizing colon cancers.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDERS
Cell line
HCT-116 cells were obtained from the Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
(Braunschweig, Germany). The cell line HCT-116 was
cultured in Dulbecco‘s modified Eagle‘s medium (DMEM,
Gibco), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum
(FCS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin.
Cells were cultured at 37° C in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2. The DIAPH1 knock down D4 and D5,
and scrambled cell lines were additionally treated with 5
mg/ml puromycin for selection.

Stable knock down of DIAPH1
Stable knock down of DIAPH1 expression in
HCT-116 cells was performed as described [20].Five
different vectors (pLKO.1 shRNA) from Sigma, coding
for shRNA against DIAPH1 were tested [20]. With two
of them (shRNA 4 and shRNA 5) a 60% (shRNA  5)
to 95% (shRNA 4) reduced expression was achieved
(Supplementary Figure 1). Cells stably expressing
scrambled shRNA served as control. All in vitro data
shown here were reproduced with both DIAPH1 shRNAs
and the corresponding cell line was termed D4 (DIAPH1
shRNA 4 knock down) and D5 (DIAPH1 shRNA 5 knock
down). The shRNA vector (pLKO.1) has a puromycin
resistance, therefore knock down cells and scrambled were
selected with puromycin (5 mg/ml).

Generation of viral particles and luciferase
transduction of HCT-116 cells
Viral particles were produced as cell-free
supernatants by transient transfection of the packaging cell
line HEK-293T as described [32]. In brief, the lentiviral
vector LeGO-iG2-Luc2 expressing Luc2-cDNA (Firefly
luciferase, Promega) was packaged using the thirdgeneration packaging plasmids pMDLg/pRRE (http://
Addgene.org #12251), pRSV-Rev (http://Addgene.org
#12253) and phCMV-VSV-G expressing the envelope

DNase I inhibition assay for determination of
intracellular actin

protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. The supernatant was
harvested 24 hours after transfection, 0.45 μm filtrated
and stored at –80°C. Titration on 293T cells using 8 μg/ml
polybren and spin-inoculation (1000 × g, 1 h, 25°C)
resulted in a functional titer of 5.2 × 107 TU per ml. HCT116 target cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells in 0.5 ml
medium in each well of a 24 well plate. After addition of
30 μl of viral particle containing supernatant to the cells,
the medium was replaced the next day.

The DNAse I inhibition assay for measuring the
G- to F-actin ratio in cells, was performed according to
Katsantonis et al.[24]. The principle of this assay is that only
G-actin and not F-actin inhibits the activity of DNAse I.
The cellular G-actin content is directly determined from
cell lysates by measuring inhibition of DNAse I. Total
cellular actin was determined after treatment of cell
lysates with guanidine HCl to depolymerize F-actin. The
F-actin content was calculated by subtracting the G-actin
amount from the total cellular actin (F-actin  =  total
actin  –  G-actin). The experimental procedure was
performed according to Windhorst et al. [35].

In vivo monitoring of spontaneous metastasis
formation in a xenograft SCID mouse model
SCID mice were obtained from Charles River
(Sulzfeld, Germany), maintained in a pathogen-free
environment and all experiments were approved by
the local animal experiment approval committee
(Project No. G09/59). Luciferase (Luc2)- and eGFPover-expressing HCT-116 control and D5 cells were
xenotransplanted into 17-week-old SCID mice by
subcutaneous injection of 1  × 106 cells/ 200 μl cell
culture medium per mouse (n = 6 and n = 7 in the control
and D5 group, respectively). Female and male mice were
equally distributed. As soon as primary tumors reached
about 1.5 cm3, the tumors were surgically resected [33],
weighed and processed for subsequent analyses. Due to
inoperability of the primary tumor, one mouse of the
scrambled group and one mouse of the D5 group had
to be euthanized in accordance with the animal welfare
requirements [34]. After surgery, metastasis formation
was monitored by regular, whole-body bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) scans (Core Facility Optical Imaging,
UKE) following intraperitoneal application of 200  μl
firefly luciferin (30 mg/ml from BioSynth). Once
metastatic lesions were identified in any region of the
body, the respective mice were subjected to terminal
cardiocentesis and the organs/bones of interest were
dissected immediately in order to re-evaluate the BLIsignals ex vivo. BLI-signals were detectable for up
to 45 min post injection and hence about 40 min post
mortem. Afterwards, BLI-positive organs were fixed
in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and processed
for hematoxylin/eosin-staining on 5 μm thin sections.
Affected bones were decalcified using 10% EDTA
(in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 37°C, for approx.
48 h) [33] prior to paraffin embedding. Independent of
the results from the in vivo-BLI scans, the left lungs
and left hind limbs from all mice were excised and
processed for biomolecular (DNA-based) quantification
of circulating/disseminated tumor cells by Alu-PCR
as described [20, 34]. As soon as all mice from the
control group revealed metastatic lesions as detected
by BLI, all mice from the D5 group were injected with
luciferin, sacrificed and all organs and the bare skeleton
were scanned to exclude even smaller metastatic lesions.

Adhesion assay
For adhesion assay 1 × 105 HCT-116 cells were
seeded on 60 mm Tissue Culture Dishes (TPP) coated
with collagen G. After 2 h cells were washed three
times with PBS in a standardized way and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells were stained with 4′,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The cell number
was examined by counting the DAPI stained nuclei with
the Hybrid Cell Count function at Keyence BZ-9000.
Analyses were performed in duplicates and as independent
experiments four times.

Nocodazole and cytochalasin B treatment
Nocodazole (Tocris Bioscience) and cytochalasin B
(Sigma-Aldrich) treatment was performed in scrambled
control HCT-116 cells. Nocodazole was used in a
concentration of 100 μM, cells were incubated for 3 h
prior to experiments. Cytochalasin B was used in a
concentration of 1 μM, cells were incubated for 1 h
prior to measurements. In all cases DMSO treated cells
served as controls. In order to prove significant effects
with the used working concentrations on actin and
tubulin, immunostainings and subsequent observation
of the respective cytoskeleton structures by fluorescence
microscopy were performed prior to experiments.

Cell spreading assay
During cell spreading the former round shaped
suspended cells flatten to the substrate and with this their
cell areas increase. Therefore, the effect of spreading on
drug treatment or depletion of DIAPH1 was examined
by comparing cell areas of treated and non-treated cells.
0.5 ml of cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/ml medium) were
transferred into 35 mm cell culture dishes with glass
bottom (MatTek) coated with collagen G (Biochrom).
After 2 hours, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/
PBS. Quantification of cell area was performed using the

at least three times.

were incubated with primary antibody solution for 1 h.
Secondary antibody, Anti-rabbit antibody conjugated
to 488 (Jackson immunoresearch), was diluted 1:200 in
0.05% Triton X/PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides
using anti-fading agent Movial. Analysis was performed at
TCS SP5 (Leica) and Volocity 6.0 (PerkinElmer) was used
for further evaluation.

Immunoprecipitation
Binding of 50 μl anti-mouse-IgG-agarose to 5 μl
anti-actin (sc17827, Santa Cruz) or anti-α-tubulin (T9026,
Sigma-Aldrich) antibody was performed at 4°C for 2 h.
Beads were washed 3-times with PBS, prior to adding the
cell lysate and the sample was incubated at 4°C overnight.
After washing the beads 5 times with MPER lysis buffer
(Promega) SDS sample buffer was added to the agarosebeads, and the mixture was boiled at 95°C for 5 min. The
beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants
were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins
were subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes,
and binding of DIAPH1 was examined by Western blotting.

Transient transfections
Transient transfections were performed using
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected cells were
cultured for 48 h, fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde/PBS or
used for Life Cell imaging. The vector EB3-eGFP was a
gift from Anna Akhmanova [25]. The vector BDNF-eGFP
was cloned from cDNA of mouse hippocampus and was
inserted in GFP-N1 vector clontech with Bam HI, Hind III
restriction enzymes.

Western blot

Time-lapse experiments

Western blot analysis was performed as described
[35]. Protein expression was quantified using an LAS3000 Imager from Fuji (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).

Cells were seeded on coverslips placed in
6-well-plates. After 48 h transient transfections were
performed as described above, cells were incubated
for 24 h before starting time-lapse experiments. The
coverslips were taken out of the 6-well- plates and
placed in a “coverslip cage”, protective of evaporation.
During Live cell imaging, cells were kept at constant
temperature (37°C) and CO2 concentration (5%). Images
were acquired using Spinning Disk (Yokogawa) Live
Cell Confocal (SDC) technology (Visitron Systems
Puchheim, Germany), with solid state lasers: 488, 561,
647 or 405. SDC was combined with two charge-coupled
device EM-CCD cameras (Hamamatsu Photonics
512/1024, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany) and
equipped with an optical image splitter for simultaneous
dual image acquisition. Pictures were taken in an interval
of 2 s for EB3 measurements and taken continuously for
BDNF vesicle analysis. The whole time interval for each
video clip was 5 min, at least 10 videos were performed
for each cell line. All experiments were performed at
least three times.

Immunostaining
For immunofluorescence analysis of DIAPH1
(ab11173, abcam), actin (Alexa 468 phalloidin, Life
Technologies), α-tubulin (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich) and
integrin-β1 (sc-73610, Santa Cruz), 2.5 × 104 cells were
seeded in 8-chamber slides (ibidi) coated with collagen
IV, grown to 50% confluence, washed with PBS and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at 37°C.
After incubation for 5 min with Triton-X-100 at room
temperature, fixed cells were blocked in 5% BSA/PBS
for 20 min at room temperature. The primary antibodies
were used in a dilution of 1:200 in PBS and incubated
at 4°C over night. Secondary antibodies were used in
a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS and incubation was done
for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS,
stained cells were used for analysis with fluorescence
microscopy. For each cell line and at each time point at
least 80 cells were analyzed. Analyses were performed in
duplicates and as independent experiments at least three
times. For co-localization studies of DIAPH1 with actin
and tubulin, the confocal microscope TCS SP5 (Leica)
was used. To stain F-actin, fixed cells were incubated
with Alexa 468 phalloidin diluted 1:500 in PBS at room
temperature for 30 min. For immunofluorescence analysis
of detyrosinated microtubules, 5 × 104 cells were seeded
on coverslips and incubated for 2 h. Cells were fixed with
ice cold methanol at −20°C for 5 minutes. All washing
steps were performed with 0.05% Triton X/PBS. Blocking
was performed with 1% BSA in 0.05% Triton X/PBS for
1 h. Anti-detyrosinated α- tubulin antibody (ab48389,
abcam) was diluted 1: 200 in blocking solution. Coverslips

Tracking software
Cell tracking was performed by the software
Volocity 6.0 3D Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer).
Tracking was performed manually, velocity and track
length were analyzed by using the Volocity software. For
analysis of EB3 movements, at least 10 EB3 signals at
microtubule plus ends per cell were tracked. For BDNF
vesicle trafficking, the number of bidirectionally moving
vesicles, vesicle accumulations per cell and number
of linearly moving vesicles per cell were counted by
eye, track length of vesicles with linear movement was
analyzed by manual tracking.
