reast cancer mortality in developed countries has been decreasing since the 1990s.1 At the same time, breast cancer mortality
trends have continued to increase in Brazil and other less developed
countries.2 This discrepancy is associated with increasing breast
cancer incidence, later stage disease at presentation (associated
with incomplete implementation of effective screening strategies,
such as mammography), and lack of adequate adjuvant, systemic
treatment in developing countries.3 New pharmacologic treatments
have been proven effective in the management of early-stage breast
cancer: hormone agents (the selective aromatase inhibitors [AIs]4 in
postmenopausal women), chemotherapy (the taxanes paclitaxel5
and docetaxel6,7), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER-2)-targeted therapies (trastuzumab).8-10 Compared with earlier
standard pharmacologic regimens, it has been demonstrated that
these new agents independently decrease the relative risk of breast
cancer mortality on the order of 30%, which translates into an absolute benefit in breast cancer mortality of approximately 3%.4–10 It
should be noted that these advantages are proportional to the initial
risk; the higher the risk, the greater the benefit.
These new agents, as well as many of the more established
effective medications, remain unaffordable in low- and middle-

income countries. In the public sector, although
treatments often are provided free of charge, the reality of budgetary considerations can make high-cost
drugs unavailable.11 Whereas these drugs may be
available in the private sector or in clinical trials,
only a minority of patients will have access to highcost drugs. Our greatest challenge in the next decade
is to broaden the access to new pharmacologic treatments both for underserved groups in developed
countries and for the general population in less affluent nations.

Broadening the Concept of Cost-effectiveness
Cost-effectiveness analyses are important strategies
that can be used to measure the value attributed to
an intervention. However, most cost-effectiveness
studies consider only a single intervention compared
with either no intervention or some representation of
usual practice.12 Other methods to consider include
that used by Woo et al13 to evaluate mammography.
Those authors set out lists of the most effective combinations of women’s cancer screening activities that
can be encompassed within current and hypotheti-

cally increased spending levels. In their example (see
Fig. 1), a sharp increase in cost can be anticipated if
screening mammography is performed annually after
age 40 years compared with every 2 years. A yearly
screening strategy did not add much benefit when
measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)
(Fig. 1). Those results originated from local cancer
epidemiologic data, and the budgets were derived
from local expenditure patterns. This overall
approach to decision-making based on a limited
budget, as observed in the example of mammography, can be generalized; analogous conclusions
likely could be applied to other situations such as
the breast cancer treatments.
We need to set limits for the interventions that
are planned, and evaluating the 10-year survival benefit is 1 strategy. For example, Telli et al14 used the
remaining risk of death after 10 years for women
with early-stage breast cancer who underwent surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy to identify
low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups,
with an associated distant recurrence-free survival
(DRFS) of 80%, 60%, and 40%, respectively (Table 1).

tion (or protein overexpression), the addition of trastuzumab decreases mortality risk by 33%. Without
taking into consideration data on long-term treatment toxicity (currently unavailable), the analysis of
the projected 10-year DRFS translates into an absolute benefit of 7%, 13%, and 20% for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively.
The corresponding numbers needed to treat are 15
patients, 7.5 patients, and 5 patients, respectively.
With limited resources and multiple treatment
options, a 10-year survival benefit analysis can help
inform treatment decisions.

Exploring Changes in Treatment Duration
Reduced treatment duration
One way to reduce costs is to decrease the length of
treatment. The HER-2 gene is amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers.15 Large, adjuvant, antiHER-2–targeted therapy trials with trastuzumab that
enrolled thousands of women worldwide consistently
showed an improvement in disease-free and overall
survival in the order of 50% and 30%, respectively.9-11
Those studies compared chemotherapy alone with
chemotherapy and trastuzumab treatment for a total
duration of 1 year. Although studies comparing 1
year of treatment versus 2 years of treatment are
ongoing, other trials are looking at shorter administration periods. An encouraging trial of 9 weeks of
trastuzumab treatment has been reported.16 Despite
a much smaller sample size, the magnitude of the
benefits of 9 weeks of trastuzumab are remarkably
similar to those observed in larger trials using 52
weeks of trastuzumab. Another trial is comparing 6

2355

months versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment.17
Along with diminishing treatment expenses, effective
shortened treatment regimens also may have an
added benefit of increased patient compliance.

Intermittent versus continuous treatment
New strategies are being studied as we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of action and
resistance to hormone agents. Clinical trials are
ongoing based on the theoretical principle that AI
withdrawal may permit estrogenic stimulation and
increase the susceptibility of the residual resistant
cells to AI reintroduction. One such study is comparing continuous versus intermittent letrozole for 5
years after prior tamoxifen and/or AI treatment.18
Intermittent versus continuous AI treatment would
result in reduced treatment costs.
Exploring Drug Bioavailability
The increase in the number of oral compounds available for breast cancer treatment provides an opportunity for drug interactions with either food or other
drugs that may increase bioavailability, reducing the
dose needed to treat, and hence lowering the overall
cost of treatment. For example, lapatinib is an oral
epidermal growth factor receptor and HER–2 tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that recently was approved for
advanced HER–2-overexpressing/amplified breast
cancer after trastuzumab failure. Ratain and Cohen19
recently published pharmacokinetics data showing
that lapatinib plasma concentrations increase when
taken with food, particularly fat (although the label
use advises it should be taken on an empty stomach). In addition, inhibitors of the enzyme CYP3A
(such as grapefruit juice) may raise lapatinib bioavailability further. Therefore, it may be speculated
that just by taking advantage of these simple food
interactions, the overall treatment costs can be
decreased significantly. Although these results are
provocative, we need to await prospective clinical
data to validate this concept.
Exploring Targeted Treatment
The first and most important advance in targeted
therapy for breast cancer is the ability to target the
estrogen receptor. After the subsequent advances in
HER-2–targeted therapies, we are now on the verge
of the release of a multitude of new targeted drugs.20
The emerging contributions of genomics, proteomics,
and pharmacogenetics may increase the effectiveness
of treatment and decrease unnecessary toxicity as
well as cost by selecting the appropriate treatmentpatient-tumor match.21

Multigene panels
Multigene panels such as Oncotype DX represent
such an effort. This panel of 21 genes (including 5
reference genes) is reported in the form of a recurrence score that classifies tumors into low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. Oncotype DX was
validated retrospectively on biopsy material from the
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
Trial B-20,22 which reported no significant difference
in the distant disease-free survival rate with the addition of combined chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF]) to tamoxifen
in the low-risk recurrence group (Table 2). At the
same time, in the high-risk group, the addition of
chemotherapy led to a remarkable benefit. Multigene
arrays can identify a large number of patients who
do not need adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to
tamoxifen and can turn regimens such as CMF
chemotherapy into targeted treatment. Although
multigene arrays may decrease the costs associated
with chemotherapy administration, to date, the test
itself is costly enough to limit its usefulness in countries of limited resources.
Pharmacogenetics and enzyme metabolites
Pharmacogenetics also can provide a more individualized treatment choice based on a patient’s
enzyme levels. There is genetic variation and inhibition of the enzyme system CYP2D6, a key enzyme in
many drug metabolic pathways, including tamoxifen.
Patients can be classified as decreased, intermediate,
or extensive metabolizers, according to their enzyme
variants. On the basis of adjuvant tamoxifen trials in
postmenopausal women, Goetz et al23 demonstrated
that patients with decreased metabolism had a
significantly shorter time to recurrence and worse
recurrence-free survival compared with the intermediate and extensive metabolizers. Once this strategy
is validated prospectively, it may be of value in determining the most cost-effective adjuvant hormone
therapy.
New roles for old drugs
Older drugs that previously were discarded or were
considered minimally active in breast cancer are
being reevaluated from a targeted perspective. The
platinum drugs, such as cisplatin, resurfaced as
active treatment for breast cancer after preclinical
models suggested their synergism with trastuzumab
as HER–2-targeted treatment.24 There is growing evidence for their role as effective therapy in the breast
cancer triple-negative subgroup.25 Small and continuous daily doses of cyclophosphamide and
methotrexate, known as 1 of the metronomic chemo-

therapy regimens, may have antiangiogenic properties as 1 of its mechanisms of action and is active
against metastatic disease.26,27 Adjuvant studies are
ongoing that randomize patients with receptor-negative disease, after the completion of adjuvant
chemotherapy, to observation versus 1 year of
metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
and methotrexate.28 In the same venue, drugs that
are off patent, such as megestrol acetate29 and estradiol,30 may find their way back in the unfolding
sequences of hormone agents in breast cancer treatment. Finding an active role for older and off-patent
drugs may represent an enormous advantage in the
cost-benefit ratio.

DISCUSSION
Treatment options are limited by available
resources.12 Choices have to be based on cost and
the effectiveness of the different management strategies. There is a need to broaden the concept of costeffectiveness and include multiple interventions as
opposed to a single intervention. The information
provided by each intervention strategy has to be
combined to provide better integrated care planning.
Quantifying 10-year survival benefit data also may
help inform decisions, because there is a direct correlation between the level of risk, the benefit from
treatment, and decreasing costs, as shown in Table 1.
A straightforward and pragmatic view of improving the cost-effectiveness equation is to decrease
costs or to increase effectiveness. Decreasing costs is
complex and involves many factors and players,
including patients and society as a whole, the payers
(the individual, government, or third-party payers),
the medical providers, and the healthcare system.31
From a medical perspective, studies of effective shortened treatment duration and intermittent administration are needed. Strategies to improve on existing
therapies may be able to take advantage of drug

Cost-Prohibitive Breast CA Drugs/Bines and Eniu

interactions with food and other drugs that increase
their bioavailability.
The emerging contributions of genomics, proteomics, and pharmacogenetics may increase the effectiveness of treatment and decrease unnecessary
toxicity as well as cost by selecting the appropriate
treatment-patient-tumor match. We are moving rapidly into the targeted drug era for breast cancer treatment in which the goal is to optimize customized
treatment. Through the use of multigene arrays and
pharmacogenetics, treatment may be selected for the
patients who most likely will benefit from it, avoiding
unnecessary toxicity and cost. At the same time,
older drugs (with lower costs compared with newer
treatments) may find their way back and have the
potential to assume new roles as they are selected
for the right target patient population. The implementation of new pharmacologic treatments into
practice likely will decrease breast cancer mortality
rates further. The ‘work in progress’ is determining
how to provide these treatments worldwide to this
growing population in need.
