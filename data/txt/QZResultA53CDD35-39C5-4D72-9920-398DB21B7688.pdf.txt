BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop novel therapies for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) and to identify biomarkers predictive for therapeutic response. Lenalidomide was previously shown to
induce an overall response rate (ORR) of 28% in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. It is currently unknown if
response rates differ between patients with different DLBCL subtypes. METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated clinical outcomes of patients with germinal center B-cell–like versus nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL
treated with salvage lenalidomide at 4 academic institutions. RESULTS: Forty patients with relapsed/refractory
DLBCL were included (24 men; 16 women; median age, 66 years; median of 4 prior treatments, including rituximab
chemotherapy). Patients were classified as germinal center B-cell–like (n ¼ 23) or nongerminal center B-cell–like (n ¼
17) DLBCL according to the Hans algorithm. The subgroups were similar in terms of stage, international prognostic
index score, prior number of treatments, and rituximab resistance. A significant difference in clinical response to lenalidomide was observed in nongerminal center B-cell–like versus germinal center B-cell–like patients. ORR was 52.9%
versus 8.7% (P ¼ .006); complete response rate was 23.5% versus 4.3%. Median progression-free survival was 6.2
versus 1.7 months (P ¼ .004), although no difference in OS was observed between nongerminal center B-cell–like
and germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL patients. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the 2 major subgroups of
patients with DLBCL (germinal center B cell and nongerminal center B cell) have different antitumor responsiveness
to lenalidomide in the relapsed/refractory setting. A large international trial (NCT01197560) has been opened to

Despite currently available treatments, approximately 60,000 new non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases and
20,000 deaths have been estimated in the United States for 2010.1 The most common type of B-cell NHL is diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which has an aggressive clinical course. DLBCL can be divided into subgroups with distinct
biological characteristics and prognosis using gene expression profiling analysis.2-4 Initial gene expression profiling studies
have identified 3 subgroups of primary DLBCL patients with different biology and clinical outcomes: germinal center B
cell-like, activated B cell-like, and type 3.3,4
There is a growing need to further characterize resistant DLBCL cells at the molecular level in an attempt to
identify biomarkers predictive of response to specific salvage therapies, better understand the mechanisms associated

with acquired resistance to immunochemotherapy, and
identify and develop therapeutic strategies directed
against novel targets and/or pathways. Prospective validation of gene expression profiling in frontline therapy
for DLBCL is now being incorporated into clinical trials. DLBCL subclassification has been translated into an
immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach that demonstrates clinical applicability.5-7 DLBCL patients are
mostly divided into 2 subgroups: patients with germinal
center B-cell–like or nongerminal center B-cell–like
(mainly activated B cell-like) DLBCL. However, the
differences in the clinical behavior and therapeutic
response of patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL
with germinal center B-cell–like and nongerminal center
B-cell–like phenotypes are largely unknown.
Lenalidomide (Revlimid; Celgene, Summit, NJ),
an immunomodulatory drug, is emerging as an attractive therapeutic option for patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms, including DLBCL.8-12 Studies
in lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) models
have demonstrated that lenalidomide exerts higher antitumor activity than thalidomide, has a unique capacity
to stimulate the innate immune system, enhances the
antitumor activity of rituximab, and inhibits angiogenesis.13,14 The effects of lenalidomide appear to be related
to the ability of immunomodulatory drug compounds
to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-a, vascular endothelial
growth factor, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) activity in tumor cells.14,15 These compounds have been
shown to induce apoptosis, and/or augment natural
killer cell cytotoxicity against MM and B-cell lymphoma cells.13,14,16 Recently, lenalidomide was found
to modulate T-cell functions and repair F-actin–mediated T-cell immune synapses against primary tumor
cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and DLBCL.17
Two phase 2 clinical trials (NHL-002 and NHL003) were previously conducted to evaluate efficacy and
safety of lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed/refractory
aggressive lymphoma (including DLBCL).11,12 In these
studies, the overall response rates (ORRs) in patients with
DLBCL were 19% to 28%, including 7% to 12% complete responses (CRs)/unconfirmed complete responses.
Responses were durable, with a median duration of
response in these patients of 4.6 months.
In the present report, we studied biomarkers of
responsiveness to lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/
refractory DLBCL in an attempt to guide the development of future clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, radiological, and
pathological records, as well as archived lymphoma tissue
from patients diagnosed with relapsed/refractory DLBCL
treated with lenalidomide monotherapy (from NHL-002
and NHL-003) or in combination with rituximab or
dexamethasone from Roswell Park Cancer Institute,
Mayo Clinic, University of Bologna, and the John Theurer Cancer Center at the Hackensack University Medical
Center. Lenalidomide-treated DLBCL patients were also
identified from local registries, the Roswell Park Cancer
Institute or John Theurer Cancer Center lenalidomide
registry for off-study lenalidomide use, and the clinical
database used for NHL-002 and NHL-003 trials (Roswell
Park Cancer Institute and Mayo Clinic) and other lenalidomide trials performed at the University of Bologna
(Eudract 2008-005631-14) and the John Theurer Cancer
Center (CC-5013-NHL-005, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00474188). Institutional review board approval
was obtained for this investigation. Eudract 2008005631-14 was a phase 2 study evaluating the safety and
efficacy of lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with
DLBCL. CC-5013-NHL-005 was a phase 2 clinical trial
evaluating the antitumor activity of lenalidomide plus
dexamethasone. Patients with DLBCL, de novo, secondary, or associated with follicular lymphoma diagnosed
according to the World Health Organization 2008 classification18 were included in our final analysis.
Demographics and clinical characteristics were
collected for each case and included age, sex, race, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score at diagnosis and
relapse, histological diagnosis, Ann Arbor stage, performance status, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, frontline
and subsequent therapies (including high-dose chemotherapy [HDC] and autologous stem cell support
[ASCS]), history of radiation therapy, response and its
duration to last prior therapy, and survival data.
Pathological Classification of DLBCL Into
Germinal Center B-Cell–Like and
Nongerminal Center B-Cell–Like Subgroups
Surgical pathology material and/or pathology reports
were reviewed for each patient at Roswell Park Cancer
Institute or at Mayo Clinic. At Roswell Park Cancer Institute, all cases of DLBCL were evaluated by IHC for the
expression of CD10 (clone NCL-CD10-270; Novocastra,
Bannockburn, Ill), B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6; clone PGB6p; Dako, Carpentaria, Calif), and interferon regulatory

factor/multiple myeloma 1 (IRF4/MUM1) oncogene
(clone MUM1p, Dako), among other markers. Surgical
pathology materials from other participating institutions
were submitted to either Roswell Park Cancer Institute or
Mayo Clinic for pathological review and IHC.
DLBCL case subtyping into germinal center B-cell–
like or nongerminal center B-cell–like subgroups was
based on the Hans algorithm.5 Subtyping was performed
on primary diagnostic samples and/or relapsed/refractory
samples whenever available. A case was termed positive for
each marker if 30% of the lymphoma cells stained positive. In addition, patients with available archived pathological material from Mayo Clinic who were participating in
studies NHL-002 and NHL-003 were subjected to pathological review, IHC, and subtyping using the same parameters and antibodies as Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
Treatment Plan
All 40 patients included in the final analysis of this review
received single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg for 21 days of a
28-day cycle. Laboratory studies were performed weekly,
and lenalidomide dose was adjusted for subsequent cycles
if grade 3 or 4 hematological or nonhematological toxicity
was encountered. Patients continued on lenalidomide
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
occurred. All patients underwent imaging studies every 2
or 3 months, with the exception of 1 patient who underwent imaging studies after 4 cycles of lenalidomide and 3
patients who demonstrated rapid clinical progression of
disease and went to hospice care after 2 cycles.
Clinical Endpoints
The efficacy of lenalidomide was determined by ORR,
including CR and partial response (PR) rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Clinical
response was defined using standard Cheson criteria.19
Patients enrolled in the lenalidomide clinical trials were
evaluated for response every 2 cycles. Patients in the lenalidomide off-study use program were evaluated after 2 or 3
cycles at the discretion of the treating physician. Imaging
studies for disease measurement consisted of computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and, if
available, positron emission tomography scans. Follow-up
for each patient was available until death or last clinic visit
(clinical data was collected until May 2010). PFS and OS
were recorded for each patient. PFS was defined as the
time from enrollment to the time of progressive disease,
relapse, or death. OS was defined as the time from study
enrollment to death. Differences in endpoints were com-

5060

pared between patients with germinal center B-cell–like
and nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was to determine
whether there was a difference in responsiveness to salvage
lenalidomide between germinal center B-cell–like and
nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL patients. CR and
ORR (CR þ PR) were evaluated for all patients, and 2sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The
estimate and the 95% CIs of the CR rate, PR rate, and
ORR were also computed for all patients.
Differences in PFS and OS in patients with germinal
center B-cell–like versus nongerminal center B-cell–like
DLBCL were analyzed, and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated. PFS and OS data were presented as Kaplan-Meier
estimates.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
We identified 56 patients with relapsed/refractory
DLBCL (49 de novo, 5 associated with follicular lymphoma, 2 secondary [ie, transformed]) treated with lenalidomide alone or in combination with rituximab or
dexamethasone. Fifty-three cases were classified as germinal center B-cell–like or nongerminal center B-cell–like
DLBCL based on availability of IHC data. Only patients
treated with single-agent lenalidomide (n ¼ 40; 27
patients were on a lenalidomide trial; 13 patients received
lenalidomide off-study) were included in this report.
Table 1 summarizes the demographics of our study
population (23 germinal center B cell, 17 nongerminal
center B cell). The median number of prior therapies was
4 (range, 2-13). Eleven (27.5%) patients failed HDC and
ASCS before lenalidomide therapy. All patients had previously received rituximab-based immunochemotherapy as
frontline and/or salvage treatment, and 67.5% were rituximab resistant (defined as progression on their last rituximab chemotherapy regimen or relapse within 6 months
after their last rituximab dose). Representative stainings of
marker expression used to subtype DLBCL into germinal
center B-cell–like or nongerminal center B-cell–like phenotypes are depicted in Figure 1. Only the DLBCL component was assessed for this subtyping.
The germinal center B-cell–like and nongerminal
center B-cell–like subgroups were similar with regard to
median age, sex, stage, performance status, IPI score/risk
category, prior number of treatments, use of HDC-ASCS,

and percentage with rituximab-resistant disease. Although
the percentage of patients older than 60 years tended to be
higher in the nongerminal center B-cell–like (82%) than
in the germinal center B-cell–like subgroup (70%), this
difference was not statistically significant (Table 1).

Differences in Response Rates, PFS, and OS
All patients completed at least 1 full cycle of lenalidomide
therapy, except for 1 patient who died during cycle 1.
Patients with germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL received
a median of 2 (range, 1-21) lenalidomide treatment
cycles, whereas patients with nongerminal center B-cell–
like DLBCL received a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-35)
(Table 2). This difference could be related to differences
in response rates and duration of response. For the entire

cohort, lenalidomide resulted in an ORR of 27.5% (6
CRs, 5 PRs), similar to what has previously been reported.
Patients with nongerminal center B-cell–like
DLBCL had a significantly higher ORR than patients
with germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL (53% vs 9%; P
¼ .006; Table 2 and Fig. 2). Furthermore, more patients
with nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL achieved a
CR or PR (5 and 4, respectively) than patients with germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL (1 and 1). Twenty-one
(53%) patients progressed during lenalidomide treatment; 14 in the germinal center B-cell–like subgroup and
7 in the nongerminal center B-cell–like subgroup (61% vs
41%). One patient with symptomatic relapsed/refractory

For the purposes of this report, the patient had PD.
DLBCL patients with the nongerminal center Bcell–like phenotype had a significantly longer median PFS
than those with the germinal center B-cell–like phenotype
(6.2 months; 95% CI, 2.9-9.6 months vs 1.7 months;

OS between the 2 subgroups may reflect the relatively
small number of patients studied and/or the limited number of active salvage therapies available after completion of
lenalidomide treatment.

with those with germinal center B-cell–like phenotype.
Recent studies using comparative genomic hybridization have demonstrated that patients with germinal
center B-cell–like lymphoma express a higher number of
distinct chromosomal abnormalities than those with activated B-cell–like lymphoma, and the 2 subtypes may
therefore represent different clinical entities. This finding
adds credibility to the concept of 2 different molecular,
biological, and clinical subtypes of DLBCL.20

Gene expression profiling analysis has been validated to predict the outcome of DLBCL patients receiving frontline cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy.2,21,22 Other
gene expression profiling studies identify different genetic
profiles (eg, host inflammatory or stromal gene signatures) that may be associated with responsiveness to frontline rituximab chemotherapy.23,24
The incorporation of rituximab into the management of DLBCL was associated with improvements in
ORR, PFS, and OS. However, this change in therapy
requires a re-evaluation of previously accepted biomarkers
of response (eg, Bcl-2 expression, IPI, gene expression
profiling). The biological, clinical, and therapeutic significance of molecularly classifying DLBCL into germinal
center B-cell–like and nongerminal center B-cell–like subgroups is being prospectively addressed by the Cancer and
Leukemia Group B 50303 study. In this study, patients
with newly diagnosed stage IIB or IV DLBCL are being
randomized to rituximab-CHOP or rituximab plus doseadjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. This study seeks to validate
the predictive value of gene expression profiling in rituximab chemotherapy-treated patients and to identify
whether a particular immunochemotherapy regimen is
more effective in specific DLBCL subgroups.
IHC appears to be easy and practical in differentiating between DLBCL subgroups. Several attempts to subtype DLBCL cases into germinal center B cell and

5064

nongerminal center B cell have been made, with algorithms using several markers (eg, CD10, Bcl-6, IRF4/
MUM1), such as the Hans algorithm and the algorithm
proposed by Muris et al.5-7 The Hans algorithm reproduces the gene expression-based classification of DLBCL
with a misclassification rate of 20%.5 Both algorithms
have been evaluated as predictors of clinical outcomes in
DLBCL patients undergoing frontline therapy with
CHOP or rituximab-CHOP.
Nyman et al25 demonstrated that patients with germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL (defined by Hans algorithm) had better clinical outcomes than those with
nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL phenotypes if
treated with systemic chemotherapy but not if treated
with rituximab chemotherapy. This suggests that the
incorporation of rituximab might eliminate the prognostic value of germinal center B-cell–like versus nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL as defined by IHC.25 These
investigators also retrospectively subtyped 88 consecutive
rituximab-CHOP–treated DLBCL patients with modified Hans criteria, in which staining for forkhead box P1
was added to the algorithm.26 Patients with an activated
B-cell–like phenotype had a significantly worse outcome
than patients with a nonactivated B-cell–like phenotype
(3-year failure-free survival, 63% vs 82%; P ¼ .048; OS,
69% vs 85%; P ¼ .110). When this patient population
was studied by the Muris algorithm, patients with germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL exhibited a better clinical
outcome after therapy with rituximab-CHOP than
patients with nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL.26
The prognostic significance of subclassifying
DLBCL by either gene expression profiling or IHC in the
salvage setting is largely unknown. Recently, Dunleavy et
al27 addressed the technical issues of IHC versus gene
expression profiling in relapsed/refractory DLBCL by
classifying patients as germinal center B-cell–like or activated B-cell–like subtypes using both methods. Patients
with the activated B-cell–like versus germinal center Bcell–like subtype demonstrated a significantly higher
response rate to bortezomib plus dose-adjusted etoposide,
prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (83% vs 13%; P < .001) and longer median OS
(10.8 vs 3.4 months; P ¼ .003).27 Moreover, gene expression profiling and IHC had a 100% concordance rate in
classifying relapsed/refractory DLBCL into germinal center B-cell–like and activated B-cell–like subtypes. This is
in line with our results demonstrating that responses to
salvage lenalidomide appear better in patients with nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL.

Comparing these data raises some questions: 1) Are
differences between germinal center B-cell–like and nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL with respect to
response to bortezomib dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin or
single-agent lenalidomide target dependent (eg, NF-KB)?
2) Is the response to any salvage chemotherapy worse for
the majority of patients with germinal center B-cell–like
DLBCL refractory to or relapsed after frontline rituximab
chemotherapy?
Although more studies are necessary to address these
questions, we believe that the reasons behind the observed
different clinical response between DLBCL subgroups are
probably target specific. Bortezomib and lenalidomide are
known to both inhibit NF-KB activity in vitro, and activated B-cell–like DLBCL is known to be driven by constitutive activation of NF-KB,28 which supports the
hypothesis that targeting the NF-KB-pathway can be clinically relevant in patients with nongerminal center B-cell–
like (or at least activated B-cell–like subtype) DLBCL. A
recent IHC study in 59 DLBCL patients with chemosensitive disease undergoing HDC-ASCS demonstrated
that germinal center B-cell–like and nongerminal center
B-cell–like patients (defined by Hans criteria) did not differ in risk of progression or OS.29 Nevertheless, among
patients with MUM1-positive DLBCL, there was a trend
for a higher risk of progression (P ¼ .08).
In our cohort of lenalidomide-treated patients, those
with nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL were most
likely to benefit from lenalidomide’s immunomodulatory
effects, which suggests the existence of a pathway targeted
by lenalidomide in these patients. One candidate is the
transcription regulatory factor IRF4/MUM1. Defects in
IRF4/MUM1 expression result in defects in lymphocytes
(T and B cell) and terminal differentiation of B cells toward
plasma cells.30 In addition, IRF4/MUM1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in various B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. IRF4/MUM1 in cooperation with PU-1
enhances the transcription of the monokine induced by
interferon-gamma (MIG) gene.31 MIG protein interacts
with the chemokine receptor 3 and induces an autocrine
proliferation signal in malignant B cells.31 IRF4/MUM1
up-regulation of MIG might be mediated by NF-KB activity.32,33 However, the multiple mechanisms of action associated with immunomodulatory drug compounds suggest
that the higher responsiveness of nongerminal center Bcell–like patients to lenalidomide may be multifactorial.
There are certain limitations of our study that stress
the need for further validation. Although the differences

in response to lenalidomide between patients with germinal center B-cell–like versus nongerminal center B-cell–
like DLBCL are statistically significant, our sample size is
relatively small. Also, this analysis is retrospective, similar
to the majority of the above-cited studies, and should
therefore be prospectively confirmed in larger populations
treated with single-agent lenalidomide before reaching
any final conclusions. Moreover, we did not evaluate
other biomarkers of response recently identified in the
postrituximab era. It is plausible that other biomarkers
may more precisely predict responsiveness to lenalidomide. Finally, it remains unclear whether our findings are
applicable to frontline lenalidomide treatment.
The clinical significance of our findings may prove
to be important if prospectively validated. We have identified a potential biomarker of response to lenalidomide
with a readily available IHC assay. Moreover, lenalidomide salvage treatment may emerge as an important and
effective therapeutic strategy for a high percentage of
patients with nongerminal center B-cell–like DLBCL.
Our hypothesis-driven finding stresses the importance of
conducting clinical trials with built-in correlative studies
of molecular relevance attempting to identify potential
biomarkers of response to specific therapies. A prospective
randomized phase 2/3 clinical trial is currently enrolling
patients to compare the antitumor activity of lenalidomide versus investigator’s choice monotherapy in patients
with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who had failed, or were
not eligible for, HDC-ASCS (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01197560). Patients will be risk-stratified
according to germinal center B-cell–like versus nongerminal center B-cell–like subtype using the Hans algorithm.
The results of this prospective clinical trial may validate
our initial observations and, more importantly, identify a
subgroup of patients with DLBCL most likely to clinically
benefit from lenalidomide monotherapy in the relapsed/
refractory setting.
