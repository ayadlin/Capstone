Abstract
Compared with the breast cancer risk women in the general
population have, breast cancer survivors have a substantially
higher risk of developing a second primary contralateral
breast cancer. Adjuvant hormonal therapy reduces this risk,
but preliminary data indicate that it may also increase risk of
hormone receptor–negative contralateral tumors. We conducted a population-based nested case-control study including 367 women diagnosed with both first primary estrogen
receptor (ER)–positive invasive breast cancer and second
primary contralateral breast cancer and 728 matched control
women diagnosed only with a first breast cancer. Data on
adjuvant hormonal therapy, other treatments, and breast
cancer risk factors were ascertained through telephone
interviews and medical record abstractions. Two-sided statistical tests using conditional logistic regression were conducted to quantify associations between adjuvant hormonal
therapy and risk of hormone receptor–specific subtypes of
contralateral breast cancer (n = 303 ER+ and n = 52 ER
cases). Compared with women not treated with hormonal
therapy, users of adjuvant tamoxifen for z5 years had a
reduced risk of ER+ contralateral breast cancer [odds ratio,
0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3–0.7], but a 4.4-fold (95%
CI, 1.03–19.0) increased risk of ER contralateral breast
cancer. Tamoxifen use for <5 years was not associated with
ER contralateral breast cancer risk. Although adjuvant
hormonal therapy has clear benefits, risk of the relatively
uncommon outcome of ER contralateral breast cancer may
now need to be tallied among its risks. This is of clinical
concern given the poorer prognosis of ER compared with
ER+ tumors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6865–70]

Introduction
Breast cancer survivors have a two to six times greater risk of
developing a second primary contralateral breast cancer than
women in the general population have of developing a first breast
cancer (1). Numerous randomized trials of adjuvant tamoxifen
therapy have documented substantial reductions in the risk of
three clinically important breast cancer outcomes, specifically
second primary contralateral breast cancer, recurrence of the
primary cancer, and mortality. A meta-analysis of 55 of these trials
indicates that use of tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the risk of
contralateral breast cancer by 47% (2). Although adjuvant

tamoxifen unequivocally reduces subsequent risk of estrogen
receptor (ER)–positive (ER+) contralateral breast cancer, it is
possible that it may also increase the risk of ER-negative (ER )
disease. Given the heterogeneous nature of ER expression in breast
tumors (3), it is plausible that although tamoxifen selectively
inhibits the proliferation of ER+ tumor cells, it may consequently
foster an environment in which ER tumor cells can thrive (4).
This phenomenon has been observed both in animal models (5)
and in humans (6). In 2001, we published the first report of a
possible concomitant heightened risk of ER contralateral breast
cancer. Specifically, compared with nonusers, we observed a 4.9fold increased risk of ER contralateral breast cancer for
tamoxifen users (7).
Since our report, few studies have further addressed this
question of differential effects of tamoxifen on ER+ versus ER
contralateral second primary; however, those that have find
results consistent with our initial finding. In a combined analysis
of data from three National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project trials of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer,
the proportion of ER contralateral tumors diagnosed among
74 women with ER+ first breast cancers varied considerably by
exposure to adjuvant tamoxifen; 43% of contralateral tumors
among tamoxifen users were ER compared with only 11% of
those diagnosed among nonusers of tamoxifen (8). Similarly,
three institution-based series conducted in Detroit, Michigan
(n = 144 contralateral cases; ref. 9), Houston, Texas (n = 193
contralateral cases; ref. 10), and the Netherlands (n = 150
contralateral cases; ref. 11) all found that the proportion of
ER contralateral tumors diagnosed among tamoxifen users
was higher than that among nonusers of tamoxifen (55%
versus 10% in the Detroit study; 53% versus 12% in the Houston
study; and 37% versus 18% in the Dutch study). However, all
four studies had somewhat limited sample sizes, did not
evaluate risk by duration of tamoxifen use, and did not
incorporate multivariate-adjusted statistical modeling of this
relationship.
Our initial study had several limitations, specifically a lack of
information on duration of tamoxifen use, other breast cancer
treatment details, and potentially relevant covariates such as body
mass index (BMI) and family history of breast cancer. We recently
completed a population-based nested case-control study in the
Seattle-Puget Sound metropolitan area designed specifically to
evaluate the relationship between adjuvant tamoxifen therapy and
risk of second primary contralateral breast cancer by hormone
receptor status and to overcome the aforementioned limitations.
This issue is of clinical and public health importance given the
frequent use of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy by breast cancer
patients, the growing number of breast cancer survivors, their
appreciable risk of developing second primary contralateral breast
cancer, and the morbidity and mortality associated with second
primary contralateral breast cancer, particularly those that are
hormone receptor negative.

Participants and Methods
We conducted a population-based nested case-control study where the
underlying cohort from which cases and controls were drawn consisted of
all 17,628 women diagnosed with a first primary invasive, stage I to IIIB, ER+
breast cancer at age 40 to 79 y in the four county Seattle-Puget Sound region
(including King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Thurston counties) from January 1,
1990 to September 30, 2005. This cohort was identified through the Cancer
Surveillance System (CSS), the population-based cancer registry that serves
western Washington and has participated in the National Cancer Institute’s
(NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program since
1974. It is estimated that f99% of all incident cancer cases diagnosed in
the catchment area of CSS are ascertained. Women with stage IIIC and IV
breast cancers were excluded from the cohort because our outcome of
interest was second primary contralateral breast cancer, and tumors of this
stage have high recurrence and mortality rates. The cohort was restricted to
women with ER+ disease because our primary exposure of interest was
tamoxifen, which is only recommended for the treatment of hormone
receptor–positive disease. Women diagnosed at <40 y of age were excluded
because adjuvant hormonal therapy is not always recommended for
premenopausal women, and women z80 y of age were excluded to help

insure that cohort members had a sufficient number of years at risk to
develop contralateral breast cancer. In addition, women were enrolled
regardless of vital status to overcome the bias that would have resulted from
excluding potentially eligible participants who died before attempted study
contact.
Second primary invasive contralateral breast cancer cases diagnosed
among women in our cohort were identified through CSS, which records
information on all primary cancers, regardless of their sequence. These
cases were defined as women who developed invasive cancer in the breast
contralateral to their first breast cancer 6 mo or more after their first breast
cancer diagnosis from July 1, 1990 to March 31, 2007 in our four county
catchment area. Controls were individually matched 2:1 to cases on age,
year of diagnosis, county at first diagnosis, race/ethnicity, SEER historic
stage of first breast cancer (localized versus regional), and survival at least
through the time their matched case was diagnosed with contralateral
breast cancer. In addition, controls had to reside in their county of diagnosis
from their breast cancer diagnosis to at least the duration between their
matched case’s first and second breast cancer diagnoses.

later by a telephone call from one of our trained interviewers to answer
questions and to either perform or schedule the study interview if the
participant was willing. Eligible participants were included regardless of
vital status, so deceased women were enrolled through a waiver of consent
granted by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Institutional
Review Board, and enrolled alive women all provided verbal informed
consent. A total of 446 eligible cases were identified of which 369 (83%) were
enrolled, and a total of 982 eligible controls were identified of which 734
(75%) were enrolled. Use of adjuvant hormonal therapy was known for 367
cases and 727 controls.
Data on demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical factors were ascertained
from two sources, structured interviewer administered telephone questionnaires and a detailed medical record review. The telephone interview queried
women on their reproductive history, family history of breast cancer, medical
history, use of exogenous hormones, life-style factors, anthropometric
characteristics, and breast cancer treatments they received. Women were
asked to recall their exposures before their assigned reference date which for

www.aacrjournals.org

cases was the date of their contralateral breast cancer diagnosis and for
controls was the date of their matched case’s contralateral breast cancer
diagnosis. Data from medical records were abstracted from multiple sources
including hospitals, oncology practices, and primary care practices as needed
to obtain complete data on breast cancer treatments, clinical and pathologic
tumor characteristics, anthropometric characteristics, breast cancer risk
factors, and medical history. For the 22% of cases and controls (n = 246) that
were deceased at enrollment, data were only collected from medical records.
For deceased women in our study, complete data for ever use of tamoxifen,
first degree family history of breast cancer, BMI, use of menopausal hormone
therapy, and parity were abstracted for 97%, 90%, 90%, 90%, and 88% of these
women, respectively.
Our primary exposure of interest was use of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.
We collected detailed information in both our telephone interviews and
medical record reviews on use of all forms of adjuvant hormonal therapy for
breast cancer including drug names and doses, frequency of use, start and
stop dates, side effects and complications, and any interruptions or changes

in patterns of use. With this information, we computed total durations of use
of any adjuvant hormonal therapy and use of tamoxifen specifically. Given the
era in which this study was conducted, almost all users of adjuvant hormonal
therapy were tamoxifen users (94%). When self-reported data on adjuvant
hormonal therapy conflicted with the data ascertained from our medical
record reviews, in our analyses, we prioritized the medical record data over
the self-reported data. This is because the medical record data were viewed to
have a higher validity considering the advanced age of many participants at
study contact and that many were required to recall exposures >10 y in the
past. Nevertheless, the agreement between data from the two sources was
quite high with respect to duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy (never,
<1 y, 1–4 y, and z5 y). For duration of use of any hormonal therapy, there
was 85% agreement between our two assessments with a n statistic of
0.79, and for duration of tamoxifen use, there was 86% agreement with a
n statistic of 0.80. In addition, detailed information was ascertained from
both telephone interviews and medical record reviews on breast cancer
surgeries, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and treatment with trastuzamab.
Our primary outcomes of interest were ER+, ER+/progesterone receptor
(PR)+, ER , and ER /PR second primary contralateral breast cancer. Data
on the ER and PR status of these second tumors were obtained from two
sources, our medical record reviews and CSS (which has routinely recorded
data on ER status of all breast cancer patients since 1988). Data on ER and PR
status from one or both of these sources was obtained for 97% of all cases, and

for the 333 cases with data from both sources, ER status were discordant for
only 3 cases (1%) and PR status was discordant for only 6 cases (2%). In these
cases, data from our medical record review were given priority because of the
careful and detailed search for data on ER and PR status we conducted.
Associations between use of adjuvant hormonal therapy, and tamoxifen
specifically, and risk of ER+ and ER second primary contralateral breast
cancer were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Conditional
logistic regression was used because of the individual matching of controls
to cases on four factors used in our nested case-control study design, and so
all models were implicitly adjusted for each of the matching variables (age,
diagnosis year, county, and race). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated as estimates of the relative risk. All statistical
tests were two sided. We systematically assessed a series of potential
confounders including established breast cancer risk factors, other breast
cancer treatments, and tumor characteristics (listed in Table 1). Only
radiation therapy for first breast cancer changed our risk estimates by >10%
when adjusted for in the statistical model, and so our final risk estimates
were only additionally adjusted for this variable. All analyses were
conducted using Stata SE. Our sample size precluded meaningful assessments of the influence of potential effect modifiers, such as age, BMI, and
the interval between first breast cancer diagnosis and reference date, on the
relationships between adjuvant hormonal therapies and risk of different
subtypes of contralateral breast cancer defined by hormone receptor status.

NOTE: Ever users of other forms of adjuvant hormonal therapy were excluded from all analyses presented in this table. The 11 cases with missing ER
status and their matched 23 matched controls were excluded from the ER-specific analyses, and the 90 cases with other/missing ER/PR status and their
matched 180 matched controls were excluded from the ER/PR-specific analyses.
* ORs and 95% CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression and are adjusted for radiation therapy.

Results
Nearly equal proportions of cases and controls received
radiation therapy and chemotherapy for their first primary breast
cancer (Table 1). The first breast cancers diagnosed among cases
were somewhat more likely to be stage II or III and >2.0 cm in size
compared with those diagnosed among controls. Cases were also
somewhat more likely to have a first-degree family history of breast
cancer and to be obese (have a BMI of z30.0 kg/m2) at both first
breast cancer diagnosis and reference date.
Overall, ever users of any type of adjuvant hormonal therapy and
tamoxifen specifically had reduced risks of second primary
contralateral breast cancer (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.8; and OR, 0.6;
95% CI, 0.5–0.8, respectively; Tables 2 and 3). These reductions in
risk were confined to users of these therapies for 1 year or longer.
They were also confined to reductions in risk of hormone receptor–
positive contralateral tumors. Also, ever use of any type of adjuvant
hormonal therapy, and use of tamoxifen specifically, was not
associated with an altered risk of ER or ER /PR contralateral
breast cancer.

Use of adjuvant hormonal therapy or tamoxifen for 5 years or
longer was associated with reduced risks of ER+ (OR, 0.4; 95% CI,
0.2–0.6; and OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7, respectively) and ER+/PR+
(OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.7; and OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8, respectively)
contralateral breast cancers. In contrast, use of adjuvant hormonal
therapy or tamoxifen for 5 years or longer substantially elevated
risks of ER (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.0–14.6; and OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.0–
19.0, respectively) and ER /PR (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.1–22.5; and OR,
5.9; 95% CI, 1.1–32.6, respectively) contralateral tumors.

Discussion
It is well-established that adjuvant hormonal therapy in general
and tamoxifen in particular reduce the risk of contralateral breast
cancer among women diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive
breast cancer (2). In this study, we confirmed the benefit of this
treatment with respect to reducing risk of contralateral breast
cancer overall, and hormone receptor–positive contralateral
disease in particular. However, we also observed that women with

first primary ER+ breast cancer treated with 5 years of tamoxifen
have a 4.4-fold increased risk of developing an ER second primary
contralateral breast cancer and a 5.9-fold increased risk of
developing an ER /PR contralateral tumor. This finding is
consistent with our prior report based on SEER data, which
observed that use of tamoxifen was associated with a 4.9-fold
increased risk of ER contralateral breast cancer (7). However, our
prior study had certain design limitations given that it was based
only on cancer registry data and could not evaluate duration of
tamoxifen use. Our results are also consistent with the observation
in several primarily institutional-based series that the proportion of
contralateral tumors that are ER is substantially higher in women
who used adjuvant tamoxifen compared with those who did not
(8–11). Major strengths of this study, which was designed
specifically to evaluate this association, include the collection of
detailed data on use of adjuvant hormonal therapy and a variety of
other potentially relevant exposures through in-depth telephone
interviews and medical record reviews, the ability to assess the
impact of duration of adjuvant hormonal therapy use, and
incorporation of multivariate adjusted statistical modeling.
Our primary hypothesis to explain this association is based on
tamoxifen’s mechanism of action. Tamoxifen suppresses the activity
of ER+ breast cancer cells through competitive inhibition of the ER.
However, ER expression is heterogeneous in most breast cancers, so
whereas the majority of cancer cells in ER+ breast cancer express
ER, some will not (3). Consequently, prolonged treatment with
tamoxifen could provide a competitive advantage for the growth of
ER breast cancer cells. Such an effect has been documented with
respect to breast cancer recurrences. One study observed that
although recurrent tumors express comparable levels of ER as
primary tumors among nonusers of tamoxifen, recurrences among
tamoxifen users express less ER compared with the primary tumor
(4). It should be noted though that we did not observe a doseresponse relationship between duration of hormonal therapy and
risk of ER contralateral breast cancer, rather the increased risk
observed was confined to users for 5 years or longer. The reasons
for this are unclear, it could be that a threshold effect is present
and that a certain length of exposure is needed to foster an environment that promotes ER tumor growth. Alternatively, it could
simply be that our study lacked sufficient statistical power to
adequately address a dose-response relationship for the relatively
rare outcome of an ER second primary contralateral tumor.
A potential limitation of this study is recall bias since participants
were asked to recall exposures that for some could have occurred up
to 15 years in the past. However, this bias was limited through the
conduct of medical record reviews where information on adjuvant
hormonal therapy was obtained for 94% of participants. In addition,

the agreement between self-reported interview history of adjuvant
hormonal therapy and data abstracted from medical records was
quite high with 85% agreement and a n value of 0.79. Another
limitation of this study was its sample size given that ER and
ER /PR contralateral breast cancers are relatively rare outcomes.
However, given the magnitude of the association between adjuvant
hormonal therapy and risk of these types of contralateral breast
cancer, our sample size was sufficient to detect statistically
significant relationships. With respect to the generalizability of this
study, it is important to note that almost all users of adjuvant
hormonal therapy in this study used tamoxifen, so use of other types
of hormonal therapy, such as aromatase inhibitors, could not be
assessed separately. Thus, the extent to which use of aromatase
inhibitors may also increase risk of ER contralateral breast cancer
remains unknown. However, given the potential mechanism
through which tamoxifen could enhance the growth of ER
contralateral tumors, one could reasonably hypothesize that
aromatase inhibitors would have a similar impact on risk.
The considerable benefits of adjuvant hormonal therapy for
women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer are clear as
they confer substantially reduced risks of breast cancer recurrence,
contralateral breast cancer, and mortality. Nevertheless, risk of a
hormone receptor–negative contralateral breast cancer may now
need to be tallied among the risks of treatment with tamoxifen, and
further studies are needed to determine if other hormonal
therapies and the increasingly used aromatase inhibitors in
particular, also carry this risk. Development of ER and ER /
PR disease is of particular clinical concern given the substantially
poorer prognosis associated with these tumors compared with ER+
disease. Specifically, women with ER /PR breast cancer are 2.3fold more likely to die of their disease than are women with ER+/
PR+ breast cancer (12).
