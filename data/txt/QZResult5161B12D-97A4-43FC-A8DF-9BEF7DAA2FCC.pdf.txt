ABSTRACT
Despite improved clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a certain
proportion of patients still develop a primary refractory disease. To overcome
these lymphomas that are intractable to existing treatment strategies, the tumor
microenvironment has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Here we
describe our search for effective drugs for primary refractory lymphoma cells with MYC
rearrangement. Through the drug screening of 3,440 known compounds, we identified
a unique compound, emetine. This compound was effective against lymphoma cells
with MYC rearrangement from two different patients that were co-cultured with cancer
associated fibroblasts. Emetine induced the death of these cells with a half maximal
inhibitory concentration of 312 nM and 506 nM, respectively. Subsequent analyses of
the mechanism of action of emetine showed that the drug induced apoptosis of tumor
cells via alteration of glucose metabolism through inhibition of hypoxia inducible
factor-1α. Moreover, emetine inhibited the potential of cancer associated fibroblasts
to support tumor cell viability in vitro and demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor
growth in in vivo analyses. Emetine also induced cell death in other primary refractory
lymphoma cells with MYC rearrangement. Our combined data indicate that emetine is
a potential promising drug for the treatment of intractable lymphomas, which targets
both the tumor and its microenvironment.

of DLBCL with MYC rearrangement, which regulates
multiple functions including cell cycle progression, cell
proliferation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism, remains
poor with a median overall survival of less than 1 year
[2–10]. Although intensive induction regimens and/or
targeting treatment approaches that directly or indirectly
interfere with MYC function including targeting of
mTOR, PI3K or NF-κB have been developed, [11–15]

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a
heterogeneous disorder comprising 25-30% of nonHodgkin lymphomas [1]. The R-CHOP (rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
prednisolone) regimen has markedly improved outcomes
in DLBCL over the last decade. However, the prognosis

these approaches failed to show a benefit in the relevant
clinical trials [3, 16, 17]. Therefore, innovative approaches
for the development of novel therapies are vital in order
to improve outcomes in DLBCL patients with MYC
rearrangement.
Recent findings suggest that resistance to
chemotherapy is mediated by interactions between the
tumor cells and their microenvironment [18–20]. The
tumor microenvironment has therefore drawn much
attention as an attractive potential therapeutic target for
intractable lymphoma [20, 21]. For example, it has been
shown that stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment
can promote a metabolic switch in malignant tumor cells
away from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis [22].
This so-called Warburg effect confers growth advantages
and drug resistance to tumors [23].
Here, we report regarding the discovery of a
novel therapy targeting the tumor microenvironment
to overcome the poor prognosis of intractable DLBCL
with MYC rearrangement. We applied primary patient
lymphoma cells that were co-cultured with cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAF) derived from a human
lymph node to a previously reported high throughput
drug screening system [24] and identified an effective
anti-tumor drug, emetine. We also elucidated a novel
mechanism of emetine in vitro and in vivo, i.e., emetine
induced the apoptosis of tumor cells via inhibition of
glycolysis. Our results indicate that emetine, which was
discovered with a screening method, may be a promising
drug for targeting the tumor of intractable lymphoma and
its microenvironment.

cells, and enables the culture of patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) lymphoma cells in vitro [24]. However, to perform
drug screening against primary patient lymphoma cells,
we considered that it was important to use an in vitro coculture system based on human origin cells. We therefore
cultured lymph node samples from lymphoma patients,
and successfully isolated stromal cells that are described
in detail in the Materials and Methods section. The surface
phenotype of these stromal cells, i.e., α-smooth muscle
actin (SMA) positive and CD31 negative, were coincident
with those of fibroblasts, and these cells were therefore
considered to be CAF. We then investigated whether
we could in vitro culture patient lymphoma cells on the
fastest-growing of these CAF. In the subsequent screening
analyses, primary tumor cells obtained from the lymph
node biopsy of patient (Pt) #1 were used. Tumor cells from
a PDX mouse model were used for Pt #2 to validate the
results for Pt #1, as we were unable to obtain a large number
of primary tumor cells from the lymph node biopsy of Pt #2.
Although lymphoma cells from neither of the patients could
survive for a long period in an in vitro monoculture, they
could survive in co-culture with CAF for a much longer
time than in monoculture (Figure 1B and 1C). Intriguingly,
the viability of the tumor cells of Pt #1 that were co-cultured
with CAF was significantly superior to that of the cells cocultured with BLS4, whereas the viability of the tumor cells
of Pt #2 from the PDX model did not differ between coculture with stromal cells of CAF or BLS4 (Figure 1B and
1C). Primary lymphoma cells without MYC rearrangement
could also survive in co-culture with CAF for a longer time
than in monoculture (Supplemental Figure 1A). We next
analyzed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the
tumor cells based on a previous finding that stromal cells
induced an increase in ATP in tumor cells, resulting in cell
proliferation and survival [22]. As expected, ATP increased
in tumor cells that were co-cultured with CAF (Figure
1D). Moreover, since the tumor environment promotes
glycolysis resulting in energy production in tumor cells,
[22] we analyzed the expression of key enzymes involved
in glycolysis including hexokinase-2 (HK2), pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1), and lactate dehydrogenase
A (LDHA) in the presence or absence of co-culture
with CAF, using western blotting. Markedly increased
expression of HK2 and PDK1 was observed when the cells
were co-cultured with CAF (Figure 1E). These combined
data indicated that CAF isolated from human lymph nodes
promotes the glycolysis of tumor cells, which allows
evaluation of the survival of primary tumor cells in an in
vitro co-culture system.

RESULTS
Establishment of the in vitro culture system for
primary lymphoma cells
We encountered primary refractory DLBCL patients
with MYC rearrangement during our usual clinical
practice. The detailed clinical characteristics of the two
patients who demonstrated resistance to conventional
immunochemotherapies and whose tumor cells we
analyzed are shown in Table 1. Both patients developed
refractory diseases within 1 year after diagnosis that
were accompanied by MYC and BCL2 rearrangements
in their tumor cells. These rearrangements were detected
via break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH)
that was performed using their formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor tissue (Figure 1A). To search for
drugs effective against these intractable DLBCL tumors,
we performed high-throughput drug screening using a
library that mainly contained known pharmacologically
active substances or off-patent drugs.
We recently reported that the mouse fibroblastic
reticular cell line BLS4, which was established from a
mouse lymph node, [25] provides glutathione to tumor

using the primary tumor cells from Pt #1 that were cocultured with CAF (Figure 2A). The results for all 3,440
compounds were plotted on scattergrams, in which the
viability of the primary tumor cells was indicated on the
Y-axis, and the WST-8 values of the CAF were indicated
on the X-axis (Figure 2B). Ninety-nine compounds
for which the viability of tumor cells was less than 0.5
were identified as potentially effective compounds.
Subsequently, we validated the effect of these 99
compounds by testing them against the lymphoma cells
from Pt #2 that were derived from the PDX model.
Ultimately 10 compounds were identified as potentially
effective for both of the primary lymphomas (Figure
2B and Supplemental Table 1). Among these potentially
effective drugs, several drugs including Verteporfin and
Brefeldin A are known to display high toxicities and poor
bioavailability in humans. In addition, the drug dose of 2
μM that was used in the current screening was too high
for the use of anthracyclines in humans, considering the
equivalent concentration in humans. Taking these factors,
as well as the possibility of translation to the clinic for
the remaining drugs into account, emetine was therefore
chosen from these 10 compounds for further analyses
(Figure 2C). We confirmed that emetine induced the
death of lymphoma cells from both Pt #1 and #2; the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was 312
nM and 506 nM, respectively (Figure 2D). Moreover,
emetine also induced the death of lymphoma cells without
MYC rearrangement with a moderately higher IC50 value
(Supplemental Figure 1B), and strongly inhibited the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

growth of various lymphoma cell lines with a GI50 ranging
from 1.5 to 321 nM (Supplemental Figure 1C).

The effects of emetine on CAF
To understand the underlying biology of emetine,
we first investigated the effect of emetine on CAF. The
proliferation and survival of CAF were not decreased
when treated with emetine at the concentration of emetine
(2 μM) that was used for the screening (Figure 3A and
Supplemental Figure 2A and 2B). Next, to evaluate the
effect of emetine on the ability of CAF to support tumor
growth, we pretreated CAF with or without emetine for
48 h and then washed the CAF to remove the drug prior
to initiation of the co-culture. Both ATP production and
CAF support of tumor cell survival decreased in tumor
cells co-cultured with CAF that were pretreated with 0.5
μM emetine (Figure 3B and 3C). This decreased support
of tumor cell survival was observed in the absence of a
direct contact between the tumor cells and CAF, when
the tumor cells and CAF were separated by a transwell
with a pore size of 0.4 μm (Supplemental Figure 2C).
This result implied that CAF support of cell survival
was mediated by small molecules including metabolites,
cytokines and microvesicles. The mRNA expression of
GLUT1, which is an indicator of glucose metabolism,
decreased in tumor cells when the tumor cells were cocultured with emetine-pretreated CAF (Figure 3D).
Moreover, whereas the level of glutathione in tumor cells
increased when they were co-cultured with non-treated

CAF compared to in monoculture, it did not increase
when they were co-cultured with emetine pretreated CAF
(Figure 3E). Addition of 2 μM glutathione to the culture
media prevented emetine-induced death of the tumor cells
(Figure 3F). These combined data indicated that emetine
inhibited the promotion of glycolysis and the provision
of glutathione to tumor cells that are mediated by CAF,
which resulted in a decreased potential of CAF to support
tumor cells.

which resulted from induction of a G2/M arrest (Figure
4A and Supplemental Figure 3A and 3B). Since it has
been reported that emetine suppresses the expression of
HIF-1α, which is a key regulator of glucose metabolism,
[26–29] we evaluated HIF-1α expression in the tumor
cells using western blotting. [30, 31] HIF-1α expression
in the tumor cells was suppressed by treatment of the cells
with 0.5 μM emetine in the presence of CoCl2, which was
used to mimic a hypoxia condition and by treatment of
cells grown under the condition of 5% O2 hypoxia for 48
h (Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure 3C). Taking into
account the fact that emetine inhibited the promotion
of glycolysis in tumor cells that was mediated by CAF
as described above, we considered that emetine might
suppress glycolysis in tumor cells, which would result in
apoptosis of the tumor cells. As expected, the expression
of enzymes involved in glycolysis was suppressed in the

DISCUSSION

tumor cells in the presence of emetine under a hypoxia
condition (Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 3C). ATP
production and both the mRNA and protein expression of
GLUT1 in tumor cells were also suppressed by emetine
treatment (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 3C). The
serial signaling cascade that occurs following alteration
of glycolysis, including decreased mitochondrial
membrane potential, alteration of the pentose phosphate
pathway and reduction in NADPH and glutathione that
leads to the accrual of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and apoptosis accompanied by caspase cleavage, was
observed in the presence of emetine (Figure 4E~4G and
Supplemental Figure 3D). [32] These data indicated that
emetine inhibited glycolysis in the tumor cells leading to
the accumulation of intracellular ROS, which resulted in
induction of apoptosis of the tumor cells (Figure 4H).

We successfully identified the drug, emetine, which
was effective against intractable DLBCL with MYC
rearrangement, through the use of a high-throughput drug
screening system using primary patient tumor cells. In
the subsequent analyses of the mechanism of action of
emetine, we found that the anti-tumor effect of this drug
is mediated by its effect on the interaction between tumor
cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.
Moreover, we successfully developed CAF from human
lymph nodes, which were useful for drug screening.
Our system, which is based on human-origin cells,
identified a drug that was effective in targeting a tumor
microenvironment, which could lead to the development
of a novel treatment for intractable lymphoma.
Emetine has been approved as an anti-protozoal drug
and as an emetic, and has been used in a clinical setting all
over the world. We determined the dose of emetine as 10
mg/kg in mice in the in vivo analyses, which is equivalent
to a dose of 0.8 mg/kg in humans. This dose is lower than
the approved dose of 1 to 10 mg/kg in a clinical setting
in humans [33]. Emetine-induced toxicities, including
cardiac toxicities, have sometimes been reported in the
clinical use of emetine in humans. However, the current
dose of 0.8 mg/kg determined in the present study is safe
in humans, with a low incidence of severe toxicities. The
50% of lethal dose in the mouse has been established as
16.2 mg/kg, and we confirmed that the same or higher
dose was quite harmful for mice. We thus considered that
it was inappropriate to administer emetine to mice at a
higher dose than 10 mg/kg with the expectation of further
anti-lymphoma effects. Although it should be clarified
whether a dose of 0.8 mg/kg emetine demonstrates antilymphoma effects in humans, we believe that emetine
could elicit a treatment effect at a dose at which it exerts
minimum toxicity. Further investigation of the efficacy of
emetine is warranted.
MYC and HIF-1α are known to cooperatively
activate glycolysis to generate adequate energy for
tumor cells, resulting in chemo-resistance through
the upregulation of many genes relevant to glucose
metabolism [27, 34, 35]. In the present analysis, emetine
affected both CAF and the tumor cells in vitro; it inhibited
CAF-mediated support of tumor cell survival and it
inhibited glycolysis due to the suppression of HIF-1α and
key enzymes of glycolysis including HK2 and PDK1 in
tumor cells, leading to the accumulation of intracellular
ROS and the induction of apoptosis. Considering that
emetine tended to be more effective in lymphoma with
MYC rearrangement than in lymphoma without MYC
rearrangement, emetine could be highly effective in tumor
cells with increased glycolysis. In addition, it should be
mentioned that HIF-1α is a potential therapeutic target.
Thus, considering the molecular basis of HIF-1α activity,
an HIF-1α inhibitor is also an attractive drug. Indeed, we

In vivo efficacy of emetine
Finally, we evaluated the growth inhibitory effect
of emetine on lymphoma cells in vivo. We subcutaneously
injected 1 × 107 PDX tumor cells originating from Pt
#1 together with 2 × 105 CAF into NOD/SCID mice.
Inoculation of tumor cells with CAF ensured tumor cell
engraftment according to our preliminary experiments.
Once the mice had developed a subcutaneous tumor of at
least 100 mm3 in size, we intraperitoneally administered 10
mg/kg of emetine as a treatment arm (N = 7) and dimethyl
sulfoxide as a control arm (N = 7) for 7 days (Figure 5A).
Emetine significantly inhibited the growth of the tumors
compared to the control arm (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B and 5C).
Body weight loss did not occur in either the treatment or
the control arms (Supplemental Figure 4A). Representative
pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) are shown in Figure 5D. Tumor cells undergoing
mitosis were prominent in the control specimen, while
degenerative cells were conspicuous in the tumor tissue
treated with emetine. Consistent with this finding, 80%
of the tumor cells in the control specimen were Ki67
positive in immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, while
only 25% of the tumor cells in the treated specimens were
Ki67 positive (Supplemental Figure 4B). Fibroblasts that
stained with α-SMA in IHC were observed in the control
specimen; however, we also observed a small number
of α-SMA positive fibroblasts in the treated specimen,
indicating that emetine also suppressed the growth of
CAF in vivo (Supplemental Figure 4B). Moreover, we
investigated the effect of emetine on the primary tumors
of three other patients who were diagnosed with DLBCL
with MYC/BCL2 rearrangement (Supplemental Table
2). We confirmed that the efficacy of emetine for these
cells was within the same range as that for the samples
from Pt # 1 and #2, with an IC50 ranging from 367 to 840
nM (Figure 5E). These data indicated that emetine was
potentially useful for the treatment of intractable MYC
related lymphomas.

identified an HIF-1α inhibitor, chetomin, as a promising
anti-lymphoma drug candidate with an IC50 of 1.3 nM
(Supplemental Table 1). However chetomin could not be
applied to humans due to severe toxicity [36, 37]. The
development of tumor specific HIF-1α inhibitor, which
has a reduced off-target effect compared to chemotin, is
warranted.
In the present study, using a drug screening method
we found that emetine might be a promising drug against
MYC-associated intractable DLBCL. We believe that
targeting the tumor microenvironment is a potentially
promising strategy for the treatment of current refractory
diseases. However, careful interpretation of potential
clonal selection and/or evolution of tumor cells during
development of the CAF and PDX models are required.
The CAF that we used in this study were not derived
from the same patient whose tumor cells we evaluated.
Mutual interaction between CAF and tumor cells might
differ compared to when both CAF and tumor cells
are derived from the same patient. Moreover we only
evaluated the interaction of tumor cells with CAF in this
study. Needless to say, the tumor microenvironment also
includes other cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages,
and fibroblast dendritic cells. Thus, we could only study
some of the interactions of tumor cells with the tumor
microenvironment. Nevertheless, a search for effective
drugs through a screening method that uses primary tumor
samples and/or tumor cells from the PDX model might be
a quite promising avenue for the development of a novel
treatment strategy against intractable disease. Validation
of the effectiveness of the drug identified in this study is
warranted in order to confirm the utility of our method.

human T cells from the patient tumor in NOG mice, 100
μg of OKT3, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb),
were also injected intraperitoneally (BioLegend, San
Diego, CA, USA). The engraftment of lymphoma cells
was investigated using flow cytometry and pathological
specimens. All the animal experimental procedures
complied with the Regulations on Animal Experiments in
Nagoya University.
CAFs were established as follows. A fresh patient
lymph node sample was mashed to obtain a cell suspension
for subsequent diagnostic analyses. The residue was then
loosened in 0.25% trypsin-ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid
solution and cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s
Medium (IMDM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco
in Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Of the
various types of cells in this culture, only the spindleshaped adherent cells survived for more than several
months. These spindle-shaped adherent cells show the
expression of α-SMA positive and CD31 negative. Since
such adherent cells were not established from benign
disease samples, these patient-derived adherent cells were
regarded as CAF. These CAF were maintained in the
above-mentioned culture condition by subculture once a
week.

Drugs, compound library and cell lines

All patient samples were collected from patients
diagnosed with lymphoma and were used experimentally
after obtaining written informed consent. The study
protocol for the experimental use of patient samples and
information was approved by the institutional review
board of Nagoya University Hospital and complied
with all provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and
the Ethical Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare in Japan.

Emetine dihydrochloride hydrate and menadione
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Reduced-form
glutathione (GSH), 4-hydroperoxy cyclophosphamide
and CoCl2 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries (Osaka, Japan), Toronto Research Chemicals
(Toronto, Canada) and Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan),
respectively. Library compounds mainly consisting of offpatent drugs and pharmacologically active reagents were
provided by the Drug Discovery Initiative (The University
of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously [24]..
SU-DHL4, SU-DHL10, OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10 cell lines
were kindly provided by Dr. Kunihiko Takeyama (Dana
Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA) within the
context of collaboration. BLS4 cells were kindly provided
by Dr. Tomoya Katakai (Niigata University, Niigata,
Japan). SU-DHL6, Raji and Daudi cell lines were obtained
from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The RRBL-1 cell
line was established in our laboratory [39].

Establishment of PDX cells and CAF

Cell proliferation assays

PDX cells were established as described previously
[24, 38]. In brief, to develop xenograft mouse models,
1.0 × 106 ~ 5.0 × 106 of tumor cells from patients
pathologically diagnosed with DLBCL were transplanted
intravenously into NOD/Shi-scid IL2Rγnull (NOG) mouse
(purchased from the Central Institute for Experimental
Animals, Tokyo, Japan). To suppress the proliferation of

To evaluate cell proliferation, the cells were seeded
in six-well plates (5 × 104 cells per well) and were cultured
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cell numbers were
counted every 24-48 h over a 7 day period. Cell counts
were accurately measured with the TC20 automated cell
counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For the WST-8
assay, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates and were

cultured for 72 h. Ten microliters of the Cell Counting Kit8 reagent (Dojindo Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan) was
then added into each well and fluorescence was evaluated
at 450 nM using the GloMax®-Multi Detection System
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

triphosphate (ATP) concentration was assessed using the
Colorimetric ATP Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
ATP generation was normalized by the number of cells.
The GSH concentration was calculated using the GSHGlo Assay kit (Promega). Cellular NADPH contents
were determined by a colorimetric determination method
using an NADP/NADPH determination kit (Biovision,
Milpitas, CA, USA). Mitochondrial membrane potential
was measured by using the JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane
Potential Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). All procedures were conducted according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Cell death and cell cycle assessment
To evaluate the cell death of tumor cells co-cultured
with CAF, we assessed cell death using an image analyzer
as reported previously [24]. In brief, 1 × 103 CAF were
placed in 96-well plates and were incubated for 24
h. Subsequently, 3 × 104 tumor cells were added into
each well and the cells were co-cultured for 24 h. The
appropriate drug was then added into each well, and, after
48 h incubation, total and dead cells were stained with
Hoechst 33342 and 15 μg/ml of propidium iodide (PI).
Dead lymphoma cells were selectively counted with an
Array Scan VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
To evaluate cell death of mono-cultured tumor cells, a PI
and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) assay
was performed as described in detail previously [40,
41]. In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well plates, were
incubated with the required drugs for 48 h and were then
stained with 10 μg/mL PI and 10 μg/mL Annexin V-FITC
for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Cell death
was assessed using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and was analyzed using FlowJo
Version 7.6.5 software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA).
For cell cycle assessment, cells were assessed using the
hypotonic PI assay that was described in detail previously
[40]. Cells were incubated with the appropriate drugs for
12 h, were then washed and re-suspended in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% Triton X-100
and 50 μg/mL PI before analysis using flow cytometry.
Data were analyzed with ModFit LT cell-cycle analysis
software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as described
previously [40]. In brief, cells were treated with the
indicated drug and lysed. Samples were separated by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred to polyvinyldene difluoride membranes
that were then blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBSTween buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl
and 0.05% Tween 20). Immunoblotting was carried out
using primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 3) and
signals were detected with the appropriate horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated second antibodies. Images were
visualized with the LAS-4000 mini image analyzer
(Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with MultiGauge
software (Fujifilm).

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase
(RT)-PCR analysis
RNA was extracted from cell lysates (RNeasy Mini
Kit, Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and complementary
DNA was prepared with SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase and random primers (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Quantitative PCR analysis was conducted as
previously described [42]. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
of the expression of GLUT-1 was performed with 40
cycles of two-step PCR (15 seconds at 95 °C and 60
seconds at 60 °C) after initial denaturation (50 °C for 2
min and 95 °C for 10 min) using an Applied Biosystems
7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems in
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were normalized by the
amount of HPRT1 mRNA using gene-specific primers
(Supplementary Table 4).

Drug screening
To extract effective anti-tumor drugs from library
compounds through high-throughput drug screening, we
assessed cell death based on co-culture methods using
CAF as mentioned above. For this screening, 2 μM of one
of the 3,440 library compounds was added into each well
and was incubated for 48 h. All screenings were performed
with Z’-factors > 0.5 and coefficient of variation values
< 10%, demonstrating the suitability for screening. The
effect of each library compound on tumor proliferation on
CAF was measured using the WST-8 assay as described
above.

Pathological analyses, immunohistochemical
staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization
The FFPE tissues of patient and mouse samples
were evaluated using routine HE and IHC staining.
Chromosomal G-banding was performed by the LSI
Medience Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Break-apart of the
chromosome at MYC and BCL2 genes was also routinely
evaluated by FISH analysis that was performed in our

Measurement of tumor metabolic products

pathology department. L26 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
was used as the mAb targeting CD20. IHC for CD20
was performed as described previously [38]. For IHC of
α-SMA (Dako) and Ki-67 (Dako), after deparaffinization
and rehydration of the sections, antigen retrieval was
performed in Target Retrieval Solution, Citrate pH 6
(Dako) for 15 minutes at 98 °C using a microwave
oven and for 5 minutes at 121 °C using an autoclave,
respectively. The sections were subsequently incubated
with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by
the addition of biotin-conjugated secondary antibody
for 2 h at room temperature. Staining was activated
by addition of the avidin-biotin complex (ABC).
Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected with 3,
3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB). The
specimens were observed with an Olympus BX51 N-34
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the photographs were taken
with a BZ9000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). All pathological
specimens were reviewed by hematopathologists (S.S.
and S.K.) according to the current WHO classification.

COMPETING FINANCIAL INTERESTS

To evaluate the anti-lymphoma effect of emetine in
vivo, 1 × 107 tumor cells from patient #1 together with 2
× 105 CAF were subcutaneously inoculated into the flank
of NOD/SCID mice (purchased from CLEA Japan Inc.
Tokyo, Japan). To suppress the proliferation of human NK
cells from the patient’s tumor in NOD/SCID mice, 500 μg
of anti-asialo ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide (GM1) rabbit
polyclonal antibody were also injected intraperitoneally
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Treatment was initiated
when the inoculated tumors reached a size of at least
100 mm3, defined as day 0. Seven mice were randomly
divided into control and emetine treatment groups
according to tumor volume. Mice were intraperitoneally
treated daily with vehicle or 10 mg/kg/day of emetine for
7 days. Tumor volume was measured every day and was
calculated using the following formula: Tumor volume
(mm3) = (d2 × D)/2, where D (mm) and d (mm) are the
longest and shortest diameters of the tumor, respectively.
