Abstract
The enormous scope of natural human genetic variation is
now becoming defined. To accurately annotate these variants,
and to identify those with clinical importance, is often
difficult to assess through functional assays. We explored
systematic annotation by using homologous recombination to
modify a native gene in hemizygous (wt/#exon) human
cancer cells, generating a novel syngeneic variance library
(SyVaL). We created a SyVaL of BRCA2 variants: nondeleterious, proposed deleterious, deleterious, and of uncertain
significance. We found that the null states BRCA2Dex11/Dex11
and BRCA2Dex11/Y3308X were deleterious as assessed by a loss
of RAD51 focus formation on genotoxic damage and by
acquisition of toxic hypersensitivity to mitomycin C and
etoposide, whereas BRCA2Dex11/Y3308Y, BRCA2Dex11/P3292L , and
BRCA2Dex11/P3280H had wild-type function. A proposed phosphorylation site at codon 3291 affecting function was
confirmed by substitution of an acidic residue (glutamate,
BRCA2Dex11/S3291E ) for the native serine, but in contrast to a
prior report, phosphorylation was dispensable (alanine,
BRCA2Dex11/S3291A ) for BRCA2-governed cellular phenotypes.
These results show that SyVaLs offer a means to comprehensively annotate gene function, facilitating numerical and
unambiguous readouts. SyVaLs may be especially useful for
genes in which functional assays using exogenous expression
are toxic or otherwise unreliable. They also offer a stable,
distributable cellular resource for further research. [Cancer

Introduction
The scope of natural human genetic variation is now becoming
evident but is enormous (1, 2). To accurately annotate these
variants and to identify which of them have clinical importance
through functional assays may be difficult for several reasons.
Natural cell lines expressing the variants homozygously are often
unavailable and do not allow isogenic experimental controls.
Artificially introduced null states can be inviable. For some genes,
such as the clinically important BRCA2 gene, even the exogenous
expression of wild-type (wt) gene fragments can cause interference
with endogenous gene function (squelching) unless assays are
performed with extreme technical care and multiple controls (3–6).

The BRCA2 gene exhibits allelic differences in its sequence
among members of the human population. Some of the variants
are deleterious, causing inherited susceptibility to breast, ovarian,
and other cancer types (7, 8). Unfortunately, in many patients who
are tested and have a BRCA2 variant identified, the alteration is
subtle, changing a single amino acid (9). For many of these variants,
it is not possible to use epidemiologic data or laboratory studies
of protein function to determine unambiguously nor efficiently
whether one should classify the variant as either deleterious or
benign.
The BRCA2 gene on chromosome 13q12-13 encodes a 3,418–
amino acid protein. Its sequence reveals only a few clues to its
cellular function and thus variation in the sequence is not readily
interpreted. The role of the protein in DNA repair specifically
involves homologous recombination, mediated by its interaction
with RAD51 (10–12). BRCA2 interacts with RAD51 through highly
conserved BRC repeats in exon 11 and an interaction domain
mapped to exon 27 (12, 13). The interaction of RAD51 with exon 27
has been proposed to be down-regulated by cyclin-dependent
kinase–dependent phosphorylation of S3291, which is reduced
during S phase and after DNA damage (4). However, most
functional studies of BRCA2 have been hampered by the lack of
well-controlled human cancer cellular models (14). Such absence
was in the past overcome by using methods of considerable
technical difficulty (5).
To accurately annotate sequence variations of the BRCA2 gene
in an unambiguous and technically facile model, we performed
targeted disruption of BRCA2 exon 11 by homologous recombination, yielding the first available syngeneic human cancer BRCA2
knockout cell line. Using hemizygous BRCA2 cells, we constructed
a library of syngeneic exon 27 genetic variant lines (a SyVaL). By
functional evaluation of multiple clones harboring individual
mutations, we were able to classify sequence variants as
deleterious, hypomorphic, or neutral and to create a pseudophosphorylated BRCA2 variant replacing the normal gene. Our data
support the importance of exon 27 in recombination-mediated
DNA repair and the role of S3291 in phosphorylation-regulated
BRCA2-RAD51 interaction.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. DLD1 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in conventional medium
supplemented with 10% FCS, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.
Targeted disruption by homologous recombination. We first
disrupted exon 11 of BRCA2 by homologous recombination using the
technique of Kohli and colleagues (15). The targeting construct was
designed to excise a part of exon 11, containing a known mutation and
including BRC repeat 6, thus causing a premature stop codon after BRC
repeat 5. The construct, which consisted of a selection cassette flanked on

both sides by loxP sites and f1 kb of genomic sequences adjoining the
targeted part of exon 11, was ligated into pAAV (Stratagene). It was then
contransfected with pRC and pHelper into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Two days later, virus was harvested form HEK 293 cells
and used for gene targeting of DLD1 cells. Infected cells were split into
96-well plates, and 3 wk later, hygromycin-resistant clones having
homologous integration of the targeting construct were identified by PCR
using a primer inside the resistance gene and a primer outside of the
homology arms (primer pairs SF/SR and SF2/SR2; Fig. 1). The selection
cassette was removed by transiently expressing exogenous Cre recombinase.
A recombinant hemizygous clone, identified by PCR using primers
flanking the deletion (primer pair OF/OR; Fig. 1), was used for second
allele targeting. Reusing the same exon 11 targeting construct, clones
acquiring biallelic disruption of BRCA2 were identified by PCR screening
using a combination of primers described above.
Alternately, exon 27 was targeted in the hemizygous cells using a
construct whose right homology arm included intact exon 27 and individual
sequence variants (Fig. 4). Homologous integration of the construct, the
presence of desired sequence variants, and allelic phase of the construct
(see below) were determined by allele-specific PCR and sequencing. An
analogous vector design was used by Hurley and colleagues (16) to
introduce an ATR mutation into alleles of a human cell and by Konishi
and colleagues (17) to convert a wt KRAS gene to a mutant allele in a
nontumorigenic human cell line.
Distinguishing homologous recombination events affecting the
active or inactive allele (‘‘phase’’ determination). The hemizygous

BRCA2wt/Dex11 cells, having one active and one inactive allele, were used for
subsequent experiments (Fig. 4). In preparation to target exon 27, residing
at a large genomic distance from exon 11, we devised a means to readily
distinguish long-distance cis relations of each allele. We first performed
automated sequencing of the heterozygous cell line to identify natural,
preexisting heterozygous nucleotide polymorphisms within intron 25. We
next distinguished whether the intronic polymorphisms were on the active
or inactive allele (termed the phase) by determining whether they were in
cis or in trans to the deleted exon using limiting dilution of the template
DNA and digital duplex PCR (18). Primers were specific for the exon 11
deletion sequence (primer pair OF/IR; Fig. 4) or flanked the identified
polymorphisms (primer pair INF/INR; Fig. 4). Sequencing was performed to
identify the allele amplified in each well.
Subsequently, after exon 27 targeting and clone isolation, the presence
and the phase of the introduced exon 27 variant sequence were in turn
assessed in relation to the known phase of the natural intron 25
polymorphic site by sequencing a PCR product incorporating both sites
(primer pair SF, upstream of the intron 25 polymorphism, and SR, specific
for the targeting construct; Fig. 4).
DNA and RNA isolation, PCR, and sequencing. Genomic DNA was
isolated from cells using Lyse-N-Go PCR Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology).
RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Automated sequencing
was performed by a core facility. PCR conditions and primer sequences are
available on request.
Allele-specific PCR. The presence of the targeting construct and its
subsequent Cre-mediated removal enabled selective amplification from one

Site-directed mutagenesis. Mutated targeting constructs were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using
the manufacturer’s protocol.
Northern blotting. To confirm absence of exon 11 transcript, Northern
blotting was performed. Random primer-labeled cDNA was used to detect
BRCA2 exon 11 mRNA, and end-labeled oligomers were used to detect 18S
rRNA (loading control; ref. 19).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were treated with mitomycin C (MMC) for 48 h,
processed as described previously (20), and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Chromosome aberration assay. Cells were treated with equitoxic doses
of MMC (80 nmol/L for BRCA2wt/Dex11 and 6 nmol/L for BRCA2Dex11/Dex11)
for 24 h. For each sample, 50 metaphases were analyzed by the cytogenetics
core facility at Johns Hopkins according to standard protocols.
Cell proliferation assay. In each well of 96-well plates, 1,000 cells were
plated, allowed to adhere, and treated with various drugs. The drugs
were obtained from Sigma except for SJG-136 (NSC 694501), which was
generously provided by Ipsen, Inc. and the National Cancer Institute, NIH.
The cells were washed after 6 d and lysed in 100 AL of water. Fluorescence
was measured after addition of 0.5% PicoGreen (Molecular Probes) using a
fluorometer (Fusion, Perkin-Elmer). Three independent experiments were
performed per drug.
Colony formation assay. Cells were plated in six-well plates, allowed to
adhere, and exposed to 137Cs g-rays. After 14 d, cells were washed and
stained with crystal violet and colonies were counted. For each dose,

cells were plated at three different concentrations in duplicate. Three
independent experiments were performed.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were treated with MMC (2.4 Ag/mL) or
g-irradiation and fixed in PBS/2% paraformaldehyde after 24 h of
incubation. Following permeabilization in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 and
blocking for 30 min in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin/0.15% glycine, the
cells were incubated with an anti-RAD51 antibody (1:200; Calbiochem) for
2 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with a rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (1:200, Alexa Fluor 488; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After washing,
slides were mounted and analyzed by a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss
Axiovert 135) and MetaMorph 4.6 software (Universal Imaging). Pictures
were acquired, keeping exposure time and software settings constant for all
samples.
Baseline or induced RAD51 focus formation was considered ‘‘negative’’
when less than 5% or 20%, respectively, of cells had more than five nuclear
foci and ‘‘positive’’ when more than 5% or 30%, respectively, of cells had
more than five nuclear foci. Intermediate phenotypes were not observed.

Results
Targeted disruption of BRCA2. We first attempted to disrupt
the remaining wt allele in a BRCA2 heterozygous, p53 wt cell line
RKO (BRCA2wt/5355delA ), but we could not obtain viable BRCA2-null
clones (21). We then tried the diploid p53-deficient cancer cell line,

*The extreme rarity of knockout clones may indicate an especially severe deleterious effect (21).

DLD1. DLD1 originally harbored two nonsense mutations of BRCA2
(22). Both mutations are present on one allele (data not shown).
In the first round of BRCA2 targeting, we deleted exon 11 of this
allele, ensuring a permanent null state without a possibility of the
reversion of the mutations (23). The other allele in the hemizygous
clone remained wt. In the second round of BRCA2 targeting, 81
viable clones having homologous integration of the targeting
construct were obtained in several independent targeting attempts,
of which only one clone had integrated the construct in the wt
allele, producing a homozygous BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 knockout. The
other 80 clones had reintegrated the construct into the alreadyknocked-out allele.
PCR and Northern blot analyses confirmed the heterozygous and
homozygous gene disruption (Fig. 1). Northern blot revealed the
expression of exon 11 transcript in the parental and heterozygous
populations. There was no detectable transcript in the homozygous
cells.
Functional analysis of BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells. Both engineered and natural cells harboring truncated BRCA2 exhibit a
proliferative impediment that may worsen with successive
passages (24, 25). As expected, we also confirmed the proliferation
rate in our BRCA2 Dex11/Dex11 cells usually to be slower than
syngeneic controls using daily direct cell counting and confirmation by assaying DNA content of the culture (data not shown). For
example, in three replicate cultures of each cell type (parental,
heterozygote, and biallelic knockout) counted on each day of day
0 to day 5, the following calculated doubling times for each
5-day period were obtained: for parental BRCA2 wt/mut x 2, 0.64,
1.06, and 1.07 days; for heterozygous knockout BRCA2 wt/Dex11,
0.59, 0.83, and 1.6 days; and for biallelic knockout BRCA2 Dex11/
Dex11, 1.61, 1.22, and 1.58 days. This modest proliferation defect
seemed stable with successive passage in culture.
RAD51 focus formation. To investigate whether the
BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells were defective in homologous recombination, we examined their ability to form RAD51 foci on DNA damage
induction. Treatment with MMC induced RAD51 foci (more than
five foci) in about 60% to 80% of BRCA2-proficient cells and, with
irradiation, in about 50% to 60% of cells. BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells had
reduced levels of foci in untreated cells, and no induction of foci
was observed on DNA damage (Fig. 2A).
Chromosomal instability. BRCA2-deficient cells display increased chromosomal instability, which is further enhanced after

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment with MMC (26). Treatment-induced breakage serves as a
diagnostic test for the Fanconi anemia (FA) syndrome, including
the FA-D1/BRCA2 group (27). BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 displayed much
higher rates of chromosomal aberrations than BRCA2wt/Dex11 cells,
including breaks and radials, on MMC treatment at equitoxic doses
(Fig. 2B).
Cell survival after irradiation. There has been conflicting data
about the sensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to irradiation (24, 26).
Therefore, we assessed the effect of BRCA2 disruption on survival
after treatment with X-rays using colony formation assays. We
observed a 10-fold decrease in relative survival of BRCA2Dex11/Dex11
cells compared with their controls (Fig. 2C.1).
Cell proliferation on drug treatment. The role of BRCA2 in
DNA repair and replication fork maintenance is indicated by the
hypersensitivity of BRCA2-defective cells to DNA-damaging agents.
We assayed survival following exposure to several clinically relevant
drugs in parental cells and heterozygous and homozygously deleted
cells. BRCA2-deficient cells exhibited greatly increased sensitivity
to various interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents, including MMC
(20-fold), melphalan (25-fold), cisplatin (16-fold), carboplatin
(18-fold), oxaliplatin (10-fold), and SJG-136 (NSC 694501; 22-fold;
Figs. 2D and 3; data not shown).
Topoisomerase inhibitors affect enzymes incising either one
(topoisomerase I inhibitors) or two (topoisomerase II inhibitors)
strands of DNA in the process of DNA replication. Our BRCA2deficient cells displayed increased sensitivity to topoisomerase II
inhibitors etoposide (10-fold) and doxorubicin (10-fold) and to a
smaller extent to topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (6-fold;
Figs. 2D and 3). Etoposide hypersensitivity was additive to, but
not synergistic with, other anticancer agents (data not shown;
ref. 28).
Hypersensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors has been reported (29, 30). Our cells
having an acute disruption of BRCA2 were more sensitive (20-fold)
to NU1025 than control cells (Fig. 2D).
We observed no differences in sensitivities to gemcitabine and
vinblastine as well as to agents that have various DNA-damaging
potential, such as norethindrone (31), apigenin, curcumin, and
hesperidin (data not shown).
The increased genotype-dependent toxicity to MMC was
confirmed by flow cytometry, indicating a profound G2-M arrest
of the cell cycle (Fig. 2C.2).

Introducing sequence variants into exon 27. The heterozygous clone used for exon 27 targeting was verified to have intact
BRCA2 function by showing an absence of MMC hypersensitivity
and the formation of RAD51 foci on DNA damage (Fig. 2A and D).
A series of mutations was introduced by site mutagenesis into a
targeting construct whose original right homology arm included wt
exon 27 (Table 1; Fig. 4). As a positive control, a known deleterious
nonsense mutation (10152C!G, Y3308X) was used. As a negative
control, a synonymous mutation was introduced in the same codon
(10152C!T, Y3308Y). Two naturally occurring missense human
sequence variants (10067C!A, P3280H; 10103C!T, P3292L)
reported from several cancer families and listed in the BRCA2
mutation database4 as variants of uncertain significance were
examined (Table 1).
The significance of the recently reported phosphorylation site in
exon 27, S3291, was investigated by introducing a glutamate
(mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of the protein) and
alanine (to prevent phosphorylation) at codon 3291.
On average for each mutation, 20 clones having homologously
integrated the targeting construct were identified by PCR;
between 30% and 80% of these clones harbored the introduced
mutation. The phase of the construct was subsequently
determined in these clones by PCR and sequencing (data not
shown). Clones having integrated the mutated construct into the
inactive allele, as well as clones having integrated the targeting
construct at an unrelated genomic site, were used as controls in
the functional assays.

Functional evaluation of SyVaL clones. The robust and
reproducible differences between wt BRCA2 wt/mut x 2 and
BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells in drug treatment assays and in RAD51
focus formation assays (Table 1; Fig. 2) suggested that these tests
were well suited to evaluate the effect of introduced mutations on
BRCA2 function.
MMC and etoposide sensitivity in the SyVaL. BRCA2Dex11/Y3308X
had profound sensitivity to MMC and etoposide (20- and 10-fold,
respectively), whereas BRCA2Dex11/Y3308Y did not differ from
control cells. BRCA2Dex11/P3280H and BRCA2Dex11/P3292L were not
significantly more sensitive than the corresponding controls.
BRCA2Dex11/S3291E , but not BRCA2Dex11/S3291A , cells were 3-fold
more sensitive than controls (Table 1).
RAD51 focus formation in the SyVaL. RAD51 focus formation
was drastically diminished in untreated and treated BRCA2Dex11/Y3308X
(a negative assay result) but robust in BRCA2Dex11/Y3308Y cells (a
positive, normal result). No significant reduction in focus formation was observed in BRCA2Dex11/P3280H and BRCA2Dex11/P3292L
(each, positive). A significant decrease in focus formation on
MMC treatment was seen in BRCA2Dex11/S3291E (negative) but not
BRCA2Dex11/S3291A cells (positive; Table 1).

Discussion
We sought to develop a model in which human gene function
could be evaluated based on comparative assessments of the
functional effect of individual in situ sequence alterations of one
allele. We believe that this has not been previously done. We
constructed a syngeneic stable library of sequence variants of
BRCA2 exon 27. This enabled us to functionally classify BRCA2
genomic sequence variants of previously unknown significance in a

robust manner that may help to predict the cancer risk associated
with presence of the same mutations in heterozygous patients.
Furthermore, we interrogated the protein based on functional
evaluation of subtle protein residue substitutions.
To show the utility of SyVaLs, we chose BRCA2 as our initial
target gene. First, as a positive control for functional evaluation of
our SyVaL clones, we generated BRCA2-null cells. To date, no
BRCA2 engineered human gene knockout cells have been reported.
BRCA2 knockout models exist in mouse, rat, hamster, and chicken
cells. The pancreatic cancer cell line CAPAN1, the only BRCA2deficient human cancer cell line (7), is cumbersome for its low
transfectability, poor clonogenicity, and lack of isogenic controls
(14). Our BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells now provide a stable human cancer
syngeneic BRCA2 knockout model.
Our knockout cells had features of BRCA2 deficiency, being
defective in homologous recombination as assessed by absence of
induction of RAD51 foci on DNA damage, having chromosomal
instability after treatment with MMC, and being modestly more
sensitive to irradiation.
To further confirm the BRCA2 phenotype and explore potential
treatment options for patients having BRCA2-deficient tumors,
we tested an informative panel of drugs in our cells. We confirmed
increased sensitivity to various ICL agents and the PARP inhibitor
NU1025, producing pharmacogenetic windows between 10 and
25 (28).
In this well-controlled human cancer model, we confirmed the
etoposide hypersensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells, first reported
by Wiegant and colleagues (23) and Abbott and colleagues (32) in
CAPAN1 cells and syngeneic hamster cells, and showed that the
difference in sensitivity may be even greater (10-fold) than recently
reported by Treszezamsky (2.75-fold; ref. 33) in fibroblasts from a
Fanconi D1 patient. In yeast, the requirement of homologous
recombination for reducing topoisomerase-associated toxicity was
shown by Flores and colleagues (34). Not all models have been in
agreement. For example, no increased etoposide sensitivity was
observed in BRCA2-deficient mouse thymocytes (35) or small
intestine (36). The findings thus distinguish cells having defects of
the distal (BRCA2, etoposide hypersensitive) and proximal (no
etoposide hypersensitivity) FA pathway (37). We extended our
experiments to additional topoisomerase inhibitors. Given the
rather low side effect profile of some of these drugs and our
measured pharmacogenetic window of up to 10 (28), we concur
that they represent candidate agents for rational treatment of
patients with BRCA2-deficient tumors.
The BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells together with various SyVaL clones
thus also represent an optimal model suitable for high-throughput
drug screening of compound libraries to identify novel agents
having selective toxicity in cells containing pathogenic mutations.
We have not seen any intermediate phenotype of our heterozygous
clones, suggesting that use of these drugs may be permissible in
cancer patients who are carriers of heterozygous germ-line BRCA2
mutations.
The lack of understanding of the functional importance and
associated cancer risk of sequence variants in the BRCA2 gene
represents a serious clinical problem. The strongest interpretive
evidence tends to come from segregation analyses and observed
co-occurrence with known pathogenic mutations, both of which
require information that is often not available (9). Functional
studies of human BRCA2 have proven very difficult. Prior cell-based
in vitro assays depended on expression of either partial or complete
wt or mutant proteins. Testing of partial gene and protein

sequences may not fully reveal the influence of the variant on
the activity of the intact protein, and findings obtained by their use
were not always confirmed using independent types of assay (38).
The use of full-length wt or mutant constructs has been mostly
limited to transient expression because it has proven difficult and
at times impossible to generate stably expressing lines (4).
Expression of exogenous BRCA2, including the BRC repeats, may
result in BRCA2 deficiency, perhaps due to squelching (titrating
out) of free RAD51 (3, 4, 6). Studies using cells having endogenous
wt BRCA2 alleles depend on the presumption that the codominant
or dominant-negative effects of exogenous mutated constructs will
govern the assay results. Thus, evaluating BRCA2 function using
exogenous expression constructs is of extreme technical difficulty.
We present here a new approach to evaluate genomic variants by
applying a simple and fast homologous recombination replacement
technique to produce syngeneic clones. This syngeneic replacement strategy was approximately as rapid as the stable transfection
of routine expression plasmids, a technique with which it shares
many invariant steps. Such approach allows an unambiguous
readout by generating multiple clones of stable cell lines having the
endogenous gene altered.
We applied a panel of functional assays to our syngeneic
knockout cell pair and selected two robust assays that in
combination provided a clear and unambiguous readout of BRCA2
function that we applied to our library of variants: RAD51 focus
formation and MMC sensitivity. By applying these two assays, we
observed our positive control to have a detrimental phenotype,
our negative control to have a neutral phenotype (same as
proficient cells), and the two variants of uncertain significance to
have a neutral phenotype.
The high ratio, relating the number of clones having integrated
a construct into the already targeted allele and the clones
having integrated a construct in the wt allele, observed for the
BRCA2Dex11/Dex11 cells (80:1) was not observed for any of the exon
27 variants. We believe that the ratio is influenced by selection
against emergence of clones with a detrimental phenotype (21).
In addition, the ratio may be potentially influenced by differences
in the targeting construct as well as sequence variation or regional
differences of chromatin at the targeted locus. This interesting
aspect of the technique deserves further investigation.
SyVaLs can also be used to test the function of individual in situ
residues of a protein or regulatory code, unrestricted by the limited
number of known natural variants. For such a purpose, we selected
the 3291 serine residue recently evaluated for its phosphorylation.
Cyclin-dependent phosphorylation of this site was shown to inhibit
both the interaction of BRCA2 with RAD51 and with recombination
repair. This site was discovered and initially evaluated using
expression of partial protein sequences (4). By mimicking
constitutive phosphorylation by substituting serine with glutamate,
we observed a hypomorphic phenotype characterized by a decrease
in induced RAD51 focus formation and a slight increase in
sensitivity to MMC. When we replaced serine with alanine to
prevent phosphorylation, neither a decrease in RAD51 focus
formation nor increased sensitivity to MMC was observed.
Our findings of inhibition of RAD51 focus formation by the
glutamate, and no effect of the alanine, do support the hypothesis
of phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of RAD51 interaction. Yet,
the use of variant endogenous BRCA2 genes provided a nuanced
relation that was not previously determinable. We found that this
inhibition is partial, not complete. In addition, where the prior
authors saw a surprising inhibitory effect on RAD51 binding also of

alanine 3291 when partial peptides were tested, our studies suggest
differently. We find that phosphorylation of S3291 is dispensable
for BRCA2-governed cellular phenotype as judged by the intact
function of the alanine 3291 variant, as assayed by a set of robust
tests used here. Our syngeneic lines thus serve as a starting point in
addressing the teleologic purpose, if any, of cell cycle regulation of
the RAD51-BRCA2 interaction.
In conclusion, we propose the creation of SyVaLs as a technically
facile, ethically acceptable, means to compare the effects of subtly
altering human genomes. It could be applied to any other clinically
relevant genes, thus permitting high-throughput annotation of
natural human genetic variation. SyVaLs also enable the interrogation of individual codons and regulatory codes in human chromosomes while avoiding many common artifacts of introducing
exogenous genes and gene fragments.
