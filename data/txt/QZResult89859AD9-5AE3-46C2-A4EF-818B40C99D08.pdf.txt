Abstract
We worked out an experimental protocol able to purge the stem
cell compartment of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma clone. This
protocol was based on the prolonged treatment of the wild-type
cell population with either hypoxia or the antiblastic etoposide.
Cell fate was monitored by immunocytochemical and electrophysiologic (patch-clamp) techniques. Both treatments produced the progressive disappearance of neuronal type (N) cells
(which constitute the bulk of the tumor), leaving space for a
special category of epithelial-like substrate-adherent cells (S0).
The latter represent a minimal cell component of the untreated
population and are endowed with immunocytochemical
markers (p75, c-kit, and CD133) and the electrophysiologic
‘‘nude’’ profile, typical of the neural crest stem cells. S0 cells
displayed a highly clonogenic potency and a substantial
plasticity, generating both the N component and an alternative
subpopulation terminally committed to the fibromuscular
lineage. Unlike the N component, this lineage was highly
insensitive to the apoptotic activity of hypoxia and etoposide
and developed only when the neuronal option was abolished.
Under these conditions, the fibromuscular progeny of S0
expanded and progressed up to the exhaustion of the staminal
compartment and to the extinction of the tumor. When
combined, hypoxia and etoposide cooperated in abolishing the
N cell generation and promoting the conversion of the tumor
described. This synergy might mirror a natural condition in the
ischemic areas occurring in cancer. These results have relevant
implications for the understanding of the documented tendency
of neuroblastomas to regress from a malignant to a benign
phenotype, either spontaneously or on antiblastic treatment.

Introduction
We carried out a program of research aimed at revealing the process
of cell renewing in neuroblastoma, a tumor of childhood characterized
by an unpredictable clinical course and a remarkable plasticity,
resulting in multiform phenotypes (1, 2). A peculiar feature of this
tumor is the tendency to regress from a malignant to a benign
phenotype (ganglioneuroma or, rarely, a neurofibromatous mass;
ref. 3).
Our approach to this problem was based on the use of a human
neuroblastoma adrenergic SH-SY5Y clone (henceforth referred to as
SY5Y), taking advantage of our previous studies (2), which unraveled

the renewal of this tumor by an integrated investigation, which
coupled classic immunocytochemical procedures with sophisticated
electrophysiologic measurements done with the patch-clamp technique. The latter permits quantitative measurements of the clusters of
ion currents expressed on the surface of single cells, providing a
powerful tool to identify cell types and differentiation stages. In this
approach, it was possible to use the grouped currents in the same way
as cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens are widely used in cell
biology and immunology (4, 5). By analogy, we introduced the term
electrophysiologic cluster of differentiation # (ECD#) to describe the
quantitative expression of a group of ion channels on the cell under
investigation, where # is a signal identifying a determinate stage of
differentiation along a specific pathway (2).
The aim of this work was to purge and characterize the
neuroblastoma stem cells, taking advantage of the reported higher
sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli of the neuronal (N) as contrasted
with the staminal cell compartment. To this end, we exposed the
SY5Y cell population to treatments eliciting apoptosis via p53
protein activation, already reported on SY5Y (6–8), i.e., etoposide
and hypoxia (9).
We show here that both hypoxia and etoposide produce an
efficient purging of the staminal compartment, synergizing to
abolish the malignant N cell production and promote stem cell
progression through the benign fibromuscular lineage.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human neuroblastoma SY5Y clone and its derivatives
were maintained in RPMI 1640 and cultured as previously reported (2).
Hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2) were achieved by culturing the cells in an
anaerobic workstation incubator (Concept 400, Jouan, Milan, Italy) flushed
with a gas mixture containing 0.1% O2, 5% CO2, and balanced N2 at 37jC in
a humidified atmosphere (10). Oxygen tension in the medium was
measured with a portable trace oxygen analyzer (Dräger PACIII).
The cells were detached from culture plates with a solution of 0.05% trypsin
and 0.02% EDTA in PBS (Euroclone, Milano, Italy) and were plated at a density
of 105/mL in 24 multiwells. Etoposide (VP-16-213, Sigma, Milano, Italy;
dissolved in medium) at 20 Amol/L was added two days after cell seeding,
maintained for the indicated times, and removed by substituting the culture
medium with a drug-free fresh medium. Untreated (control) cultures were also
subjected to change of medium at the same incubation times.
Cell viability was determined by the crystal violet staining method (11).
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence was done essentially as
previously described (2).
Each cell population was tested for the following list of antibodies: mouse
anti–smooth muscle actin (1:800; Sigma); mouse anti-calponin (1:3,000; Sigma);
mouse anti-nestin (1:800; BD Transduction Laboratories, Milano, Italy); mouse
anti–neurofilament 68 (1:1,500, Sigma); mouse anti–neurofilament 160 (1:2,000;
Sigma); mouse anti–neurofilament 200 (1:2,500; Sigma); rabbit anti-p75 (1:800;
Chemicon, Milano, Italy); mouse anti-vimentin (1:3,000; Sigma); mouse antiCD133 (1:11; Miltenyi Biotec, Bologna, Italy); mouse anti-CD117 (c-kit; 1:50; BD
PharMingen, Milano, Italy); and mouse anti–microtubule-associated protein 2
(MAP2; 1:2,500; Sigma).

Neuroblastoma Stem Cells and Tumor Regression
Patch-clamp recordings. Cells were seeded on 35-mm Petri dishes
(Corning, Milano, Italy) and traces recorded with the patch-clamp amplifier
MultiClamp 700A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the whole-cell
configuration or the perforated patch to record the resting potential (V REST) and
the action potential (2). The following ion currents (12, 13) were measured during
incubation: I HERG, mediated by the Human eag related (HERG) potassium
channels; I KDR, mediated by the Delayed Rectifier Potassium (KDR) channels;
I Na, mediated by sodium tetrodotoxin-sensitive channels; and I KIR, mediated by
the Inward Rectifier Potassium (KIR) channels. For a precise measurement of the
current gating parameters, pipette, cell capacitance, and series resistance (up to
70–80%) were carefully compensated before each voltage clamp protocol run.
The protocol used to measure the tail I HERG maximal current (I MAX) started from
a holding of 0 mVand testing the current at 120 mVafter preconditioning from
0 to 70 mV for 15 s. The I KIR and I HERG currents were elicited at various
potentials ( from 0 to 140 mV), starting with a holding potential of 0 or 70 mV,
following the practice of Faravelli et al. (ref. 14; currents were obtained at

[K+]0 = 40 mmol/L). For the activation of I KDR, cells were preconditioned at 80
mV and test potential ranged from 10 to +70 mV, with step increments of 10
mV. For activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive I Na, cells were preconditioned at
90 mV and currents recorded from 40 to +30 mV with step increments of 10
mV. This protocol also reveals I KDR, without overlapping of the two currents,
which activate quite distantly on the time scale.

Figure 1. Morphologic, electrophysiologic, and immunocytochemical profiles of various cell types spontaneously developing from the SY5Y clone. A1 to A4, the
parental clone is nearly 100% constituted of N-type cells (A1 ) and expresses the ECDN (substantial I HERG, strong I KDR, and scanty I Na; A2). The neuronal commitment
of these cells is supported by the expression of the immunocytochemical markers neurofilament 68 (NF68) and MAP2 (A3 and A4 ), whereas their persistent
immaturity is indicated by the expression of nestin (see the whole immunocytochemical profile on the last row on the right). Cells were patched in the whole-cell
configuration and the current density was expressed in pA/pF. The currents are specifically abolished (not shown) by the following inhibitors with the respective
concentrations: I HERG, 2 Amol/L WAY 123,398; I KDR, 20 mmol/L tetraethylammonium; I Na, 2 Amol/L tetrodotoxin. B1 to B4, morphology of S0 population derived
by SY5Y clone on limiting dilution (B1). The electrophysiologic profile of these cells (ECDS0) is characterized by the absence of any substantial current (nude
profile; B2), whereas their immunocytochemical profile is distinguished by the expression of the typical neural crest stem cells markers p75 and CD133 (B3 and B4 ).
C1 to C3, after continuously removal of N-type cells, the S0 component is progressively substituted by S1 cells (C1). The S1 electrophysiologic profile (ECDS1) shows
an increase of I HERG and I Na with no substantial change in I KDR (C2 ). The expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA ) supports an early fibromuscular commitment
(C3 ). D1 to D3, after 3 mo, the culture seems to be prevalently populated by S2 cells. The electrophysiologic profile of these cells (ECDS2) as compared with ECDS1
shows a marked increase of I HERG and a substantial increase of I KDR (D2 ), whereas the expression of calponin (D3 ) reflects the further cell commitment to the
fibromuscular lineage.

which was characterized by a substantial I HERG, a strong I KDR,
and a scanty I Na (Fig. 1A1–A4). On limiting dilution of the SY5Y
population, stem cell (S0) subclones emerged, which were constituted
of epithelial-like strongly adherent cells (Fig. 1B1). For f15 to 20 days
after seeding, the morphology of these subclones remained unvaried
and they expressed the ‘‘nude’’ (current devoid) electrophysiologic
profile (ECDS0; Fig. 1B2). Characteristically, S0 cells expressed the
p75, CD133, and c-kit markers (Fig. 1B3 and B4) typical of the neural
crest stem cells. Initially, N-type cells were prevalently generated from
S0 (2) but, provided that they are continuously removed, the culture
became progressively constituted of fibromuscular committed cells
(S1-S2; Fig. 1C and D), whose electrophysiologic profiles (ECDS1 and
ECDS2) were, at first, characterized by the increase of I HERG and I Na
(ECDS1) and then by decline of I HERG and increase of I KDR (ECDS2;
Fig. 1C2 and D2). The S1-S2 progressive fibromuscular commitment
was supported by the expression of smooth muscle actin and
calponin (Fig. 1C3 and D3). This expression is invariably followed by
the exhaustion of the culture, indicating that the S2 stage represents
a terminal differentiation step of the original staminal pool.

numbers as well as in the N/S cell ratio up to the end of the
incubation, when the S cells represented the vast majority of the
population. The removal of the drug at 24 h determined a
substantial recovery due to the fact that, at this time, S cells started
proliferating while N cells continued to die. In the long term, this
treatment produced a complete disappearance of N cells and the
replenishment of the culture with S-type cells. This protocol
(20 Amol/L etoposide at time 0, removal of the drug 24 h later, and
follow-up to the end of incubation) was applied in the experiments
reported below.
Immunofluorescence. Figure 2 reports the morphology and cell
markers identified by immunofluorescence at various developmental
stages of the neuroblastoma cell population exposed to etoposide for
24 h. Soon after drug removal (Fig. 2A1), the N cells were strongly
diminished in number (compare with Fig. 1A1), but S-type cells were
still scanty. At day 10 of recovery, the ratio of N/S cells was inverted
(Fig. 2A2). The N replacement by S viable cells became nearly complete
at day 30 of recovery (Fig. 2A3). This trend was confirmed by the
immunocytochemical data reported in Fig. 2C. In fact, within 30 days
of recovery, the percentage of cells positive to neurofilament 68 and
MAP2 was strongly reduced, whereas the percentage of the following
two types of cells was found to be increased: (a) cells identifiable by
markers of S0 cells (CD133, c-kit, and, to a major extent, p75); (b)
committed fibromuscular progenies S1 and S2 (smooth muscle actin
and calponin positive). Such commitment did not exclude the

persistence of a significant degree of immaturity, as indicated by the
100% cell positivity to nestin (15).
Taken in their entirety, these results indicated the following
effects of etoposide: (a) the abolition of the N cell compartment
and (b) the induction of the S0-S1-S2 pattern of differentiation.
These results closely mimic the effects of repeated mechanical
removal of N cells from the neuroblastoma culture, which were
reported in our previous work (2).
Similar conclusions can be drawn from the experiments testing
the effect of hypoxia on the neuroblastoma evolution in culture
(Fig. 2B1–B3). During the first 3 days of incubation in hypoxia, the
cell population did not undergo any significant morphologic or
viability change, as compared with the control parental SY5Y clone
(see Figs. 1A1 and 2B1). On the other hand, at day 10, the culture
already manifested a marked inversion of the N/S ratio (Fig. 2B2).

or during hypoxia (C ). Currents were measured in voltage clamp in the whole-cell
configuration. The pipettes used (borosilicate glass, Harvard Apparatus, Kent,
United Kingdom) had resistances ranging between 3 and 5 MV. Gigaseal
resistances were in the of range 1 to 10 GV. The cell capacitance was obtained
directly by reading the cell capacitance compensation. Input resistances of the
cells were in the range of 2 to 6 GV. Whole-cell currents were filtered at 1 to 3 kHz.
For data acquisition and analysis, the pClamp and Axoscope software (Axon
Instruments) and Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) were routinely
used. Extracellular solutions were delivered with hypodermic needles inserted
into a capillary with a small hole (inner diameter, 0.4 mm), positioned near the cell
under study. The extracellular solution with low potassium (low K0 solution
[K+]0 = 5 mmol/L) contained (in millimolar) NaCl 130, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2,

The similarity of effects displayed by etoposide and hypoxia was
further explored by testing the combination of the two treatments.
At time 0, cells were simultaneously exposed to hypoxia and
etoposide. The drug was removed after 24 h, whereas hypoxia was
maintained throughout the experimental time. Morphologic,
immunocytochemical, and electrophysiologic data (Fig. 4A1–C)
concurred to indicate that, as compared with the separate
treatments, the combined treatment produces (a) a marked
acceleration of the N cell compartment abolition (compare
Figs. 2–4) and (b) a more rapid development of the S0, S1, and S2
S2 components.

elimination of the N cell compartment and thereafter to the
purging of the S0 cells and their terminal commitment to the
fibromuscular phenotype.
All in all, our study suggests that hypoxia, which we have shown
to allow the purging of the neuroblastoma staminal compartment
in vitro, might have important implications for the natural history
of this tumor in vivo. In fact, neuroblastoma, just like any other
malignancy, unavoidably develops ischemic areas, selecting hypoxia-resistant clones (16, 17). In these areas, the peculiar effect of
hypoxia described in this article may manifest itself with the
abolition of the aggressive N component and with the S0 terminal
commitment to the benign fibromuscular phenotype.
A major question still to be resolved concerns the status of
S0 cells in the context of the neuroblastoma population. The
established features of these cells are the following: (a) a high
clonogenic potency (we followed a single-cell clonal expansion up
to hundreds of cells); (b) an at least bipotent plasticity (neuronal
and fibromuscular); (c) the requirement of an abundant N cell
progeny to maintain the S0 self-renewal capacity (2); (d) the
abolition of the S0 option for the N lineage when N cell generation
is impaired; and (e) the exhaustion of the S0 staminal status in
hypoxia.
As far as we know, no example of similar behavior in normal or
cancer stem cells has been described thus far. We are inclined to
trace this behavior back to the tendency of the neural crest
staminal compartments to generate more or less committed
progenitors, which nevertheless maintain a substantial capacity
for self-renewal together with clonogenic potential (18). It is
conceivable that S0 cells belong to a progenitor category of this
kind, restricted to the neuronal and fibromuscular lineages. Of
the two possible fates, the neuronal differentiation pathway is
evidently arrested at a defective stage, driving the overwhelming
proliferation of the committed N progenitors and monopolizing
the S0 progeny before its bifurcation. The N cell population might
contribute to the maintenance of the staminal status of S0 cells
with soluble factors or cell-to-cell contacts. Only when this
contribution is abolished by mechanically removing the N cells or
by hypoxic or antiblastic treatment can the S0 cells fully
accomplish their terminal differentiation. This interpretation of
the evidence implies that neoplastic transformation in the SY5Y
clone reflects a differentiation block downstream from the stem
cell compartment.
In conclusion, the S0 cell behavior that emerges from our study is
the first experimental hint to explain the reported spontaneous or
inducible regression of this tumor from a malignant to a benign
phenotype (7, 19). Indeed, the response of S0 cells to hypoxia seems
to be able to sustain this conversion, promoting the differentiation
of stem cells instead of freezing them in a dormant state, as what
happens in most types of tumor (1, 20). At the same time, the
synergy of hypoxia with etoposide, far from being an empirical
abstraction, might have an important role to play in the context of
ischemic areas of tumors treated with antiblastic drugs.

Discussion

Acknowledgments

There are two major facts to emerge from this study. First, the
cell reservoir represented by the S0 staminal compartment is
substantially insensitive to apoptotic stimuli, and it transmits this
insensitivity to progeny of the S-type but not the N-type. Second,
hypoxia and etoposide affect the spontaneous development of
SY5Y clone in the same way, leading initially to the progressive

This effect of hypoxia increased with time, so that at day 30 the cell
population was almost exclusively constituted of living S-type cells
(Fig. 2B3). Thus, hypoxia affects the neuroblastoma evolution in a
very similar way as etoposide, although at a faster rate. The same
conclusion applies to the expression of the prevalent cell marker
profile, which, within 30 days, shifts from the N-type cells (neurofilament 68 and MAP2 positive) to those expressed during the
S0-S1-S2 progression (smooth muscle actin and calponin positive;
Fig. 2D).
ECD. The time course of ECD during the neuroblastoma
population development in the absence of or after treatment with
etoposide or hypoxia is illustrated in Fig. 3. In this figure, patchclamp data are represented using the plot I KDR versus I HERG, which
proved particularly suitable to discriminate cell subpopulations on
the basis of the two major currents simultaneously expressed in
each single cell (2). In the case of the SY5Y clone and its derivatives,
this approach allowed the identification of four compartments
(Fig. 3), including one or other of the cell types composing the
entire population. The limits of these compartments were traced as
follows: N cell compartment, I HERG > 20 pA/pF, I KDR > 60 pA/pF; S0
compartment, I HERG < 60 pA/pF, I KDR < 20 pA/pF; S1 compartment,
I HERG > 60 pA/pF, I KDR < 60 pA/pF; S2 compartment, I HERG < 60 pA/
pF, 20 pA/pF < I KDR < 60 pA/pF.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the totality of the SY5Y parental cells
seemed to be included in the N compartment, in keeping with the
large prevalence of this population in this clone. On the other
hand, at 30 days of recovery from etoposide (Fig. 3B), the N
compartment became empty while cells were accumulated in the
S0, S1, and S2 compartments. The same considerations apply to the
effects of hypoxic incubation, in particular at day 45 (Fig. 3C).
On the whole, the electrophysiologic screening is consistent with
the immunocytochemical analysis of the etoposide and hypoxic
treatments illustrated above.
In conclusion, the overall neuroblastoma cell population
responds to both etoposide and hypoxia with a profound
modification of its composition. The N subset, which dominates
in the parental clone, is indeed progressively abolished, leaving
space for the onset and development of the S subsets, up to the
absolute predominance of the S2 cells at the end of culture.
