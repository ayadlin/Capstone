ABSTRACT
Studies have shown that vitamin E and selenium possess antiproliferative effects
against prostate cancer (PCa). However, results from the Selenium and Vitamin E
Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) suggest that vitamin E (α-tocopheryl acetate; 400
mg) and/or selenium (L-selenomethionine; 200 μg) were ineffective against PCa in
humans. It is arguable that the selected dose/formulation of vitamin E/selenium were
not optimal in SELECT. Thus, additional studies are needed to define the appropriate
formulations/dose regimens of these agents. Here, we investigated the effect of
methaneseleninic acid (MSA; 41 µg/kg) and/or γ-tocopherol (γT; 20.8 mg/kg or 41.7
mg/kg) in Nu/J mice implanted with 22Rν1 tumors. MSA (41 µg/kg) and γT (20.8
mg/kg) combination was most consistent in imparting anti-proliferative response;
resulting in a significant decrease in i) tumor volume/weight, ii) serum PSA, and iii)
Ki-67 immunostaining. Further, we observed i) an upregulation of pro-apoptosis Bax
and a down-regulation of the pro-survival Bcl2, and ii) an increase in pro-apoptosis
Bad. Furthermore, the combination resulted in a modulation of apolipoprotein E,
selenoprotein P and Nrf2 in a fashion that favors antiproliferative responses. Overall,
our study suggested that a combination of MSA and γT, at lower dose regimen, could
be useful in PCa management.

INTRODUCTION

in preclinical, epidemiological, and phase III randomized
placebo-controlled clinical trials [2-4]. Based on these
studies, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention
Trial (SELECT) was designed and initiated in the year
2001 to test the hypothesis that daily use of selenium (in
the form of 200 μg of L-selenomethionine) and vitamin
E (in the form of 400 mg of all rac α-tocopheryl acetate),
used alone or in combination, would prevent PCa in
a cohort of 35,533 healthy men who were at average
risk for PCa [5]. In 2008, SELECT was prematurely
terminated after 5.5 years (1.5 years before its intended
minimum follow up length) because selenium and vitamin
E were not able to prevent PCa incidences [5]. Further,
a significant increase in incidences of PCa was noticed
in a longer follow-up study of SELECT participants [6].

PCa is a major health problem in elderly males.
In the United States alone, 238,590 new PCa cases and
29,720 related deaths were expected in the year 2013
[1]. The impact of PCa on public health has spawned
tremendous interest in the possible use of non-toxic
chemopreventive agents for prevention as well as
treatment of this neoplasm. A wide range of naturally
occurring chemopreventive agents have been tested
for PCa management in chemopreventive as well as
therapeutic settings. Selenium and vitamin E are essential
human dietary components, which have been shown to
possess therapeutic and preventive effects against PCa

RESULTS

Thus, the outcome of SELECT was disappointing for the
scientific community as well as general public.
Interestingly, concerns were raised by the scientific
community regarding the premature nature of the trial
and the chosen formulations and doses of vitamin E and
selenium used, even before the start of SELECT ([7],
and reviewed in [8]). Indeed, according to the USDA
Dietary Reference Intake Data, the Recommended Daily
Allowances (RDA) for selenium is 55 µg (3.6 times
lower dose than used in SELECT) and 15 mg for vitamin
E (26.7 times lower dose than used in SELECT) [9]. In
addition, SELECT was a prevention trial based on a longterm intake of the two agents. Therefore, arguments can
be made against the used high dose regimens of selenium
and vitamin E. This is particularly relevant to the dose
of vitamin E because the design of SELECT was based
on two previous clinical trials, 1) the Alpha-Tocopherol
Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study, and 2)
the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) study [4, 10].
While SELECT used the same formulation of vitamin
E as in ATBC, the dose was 8 times higher (50 mg/day
in ATBC vs. 400 mg/day in SELECT) [4]. Interestingly,
another previous trial suggested that high-dose (≥400 mg/
day) vitamin E supplements may in fact increase all-cause
mortality and should be avoided [11]. Similarly, while the
selenium dose remained the same in SELECT as in the
NPC study (200 µg/day), SELECT used selenomethionine
while NPC had used selenium-enriched yeast [12]. In
both previous trials, the ages of the subjects were about
10 years higher than that those recruited in SELECT. In
addition, the biology of vitamin E and selenium was not
well-understood at the time when SELECT was designed.
Following the failure of SELECT, a number of
formulations and dose regimens of vitamin E and selenium
are being revisited in many pre-clinical studies. Some
studies have suggested that while γ-tocopherol (γT) is
effective against cancer, α-tocopherol (the formulation that
was used in SELECT) lacks anti-proliferative effects in
different cancer models [13-17]. Similar observations were
made for selenomethionine, which was used in SELECT
as the source of selenium [18-20]. One head-to-head
study demonstrated superior growth inhibitory efficacy
of methaneseleninic acid (MSA) over selenomethionine
and selenite in human PCa xenograft models [18].
Another interesting study compared the effects of different
selenium compounds on mouse prostate proteome profiles
and suggested MSA to be the best among the four
tested selenium compounds at preferentially altering the
proteome [19]. Additionally, dietary supplementation
with MSA, but not selenomethionine, was found to
reduce spontaneous metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma
in C57BL/6 mice [20]. Thus, these recent studies provided
us a rationale to determine the efficacy of MSA and/or
γ-tocopherol against PCa in nude mice xenografts.

Effects of MSA and/or γT on 22Rν1 implanted
prostate tumors
This in vivo study was performed to assess the
efficacy of MSA and γT alone and in combination in
athymic nude mice implanted subcutaneously with
human prostate carcinoma 22Rν1 cells. This cell line
was established from a human prostate tumor xenograft
(CWR22R) and shows characteristics of well differentiated
adenocarcinoma [21]. An advantage of this cell line is that
when implanted in nude mice, they release PSA that can
be measured in blood. Our specific objectives were to
determine, 1) if MSA or γT (at two different doses, shown
as γT1 and γT2) alone possesses anti-proliferative effects
against prostate tumorigenesis in vivo, and 2) whether two
different combinations of these agents - MSA + γT1 and/
or MSA + γT2 are better than either MSA or γT alone. The
tumor data (tumor size, tumor volume and wet weight) and
serum PSA levels are presented in figure 1. Representative
tumor images of each treatment group are presented in
figure 1A which clearly shows shrinking size of the tumor
in all treatment groups but most predominantly in MSA +
γT1 group. Although we found a decreasing trend in tumor
volume after one week in all treatment groups (Figure 1B),
a significant decrease in tumor volume was observed at the
termination of study (Figure 1C). However, a significant
decrease in tumor weight was only evident for γT2 and
MSA + γT1 groups whereas the other three treatment
groups showed a non-significant decreasing trend (Figure
1D). We also determined the effect of treatments on the
prostate specific marker, PSA which is an indicator of
PCa progression. Interestingly, although all the treatment
groups showed a decreasing trend in serum PSA levels,
when analyzed for statistical significance, only the MSA
and MSA + γT1 groups demonstrated significance (Figure
1E).

Effects of MSA and/or γT on proliferation index
in 22Rν1 implanted prostate tumors
In the next experiment, we determined the effect
of MSA and/or γT on proliferation in tumor tissues
harvested from animals of different treatment groups.
This was achieved by assessing the staining intensity of
the proliferation marker Ki-67. As shown in figure 2, a
decreasing trend in Ki-67 immunostaining was observed
in all of the treatment groups. However, no experimental
groups achieved statistical significance for Ki-67 intensity
score (data not shown).

Effects of MSA and/or γT on Bax/Bcl2 ratio
(apoptosis index) in 22Rν1 implanted prostate
tumors

Bax was significantly up-regulated in γT1, γT2 and MSA
+ γT1 treatment groups, whereas Bcl2 expression was
noticeably down-regulated in the MSA, γT1 and MSA
+ γT1 groups (Figure 4A and 4B). The qRT-PCR data
demonstrated a marked increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio
in MSA, γT1 and MSA + γT1 groups, as evident form
decreasing ΔCT value (Figure 4C). The qRT-PCR data are
plotted as ΔCT, means decrease value indicate increase in
gene expression and vice-versa.

Since a dysregulation of apoptosis machinery
is a major characteristic of cancer growth, we next
examined the effect of MSA and/or γT on protein levels
of the apoptosis markers Bax and Bcl2 and calculated
the apoptosis index by determining the ratio of proapoptosis Bax to anti-apoptosis Bcl2 (Bax/Bcl2). As
shown in figure 3, we observed a significant increase in
the pro-apoptosis protein Bax in the γT2, MSA + γT1
and MSA + γT2 groups; however, a significant decrease
in the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl2 was only noticed in the
MSA +γT1 group (Figure 3A and 3B). Surprisingly, the
expression level of Bcl2 in the MSA + γT2 group was
found to be even higher than that of control. This resulted
in an apoptosis index (i.e. Bax/Bcl2 ratio) that was only
significantly higher in the γT1, γT2 and MSA + γT1
groups at the protein level (Figure 3C).
We also determined the effects of treatments on Bax
and Bcl2 modulation at the transcriptional level (Figure 4).
As evident from the qRT-PCR data, compared to control,

Effects of MSA and/or γT on pro-apoptosis Bad in
22Rν1 implanted prostate tumors
Another Bcl2 family protein, Bad, is known to play
an important role in apoptosis induction. Therefore, we
analyzed the effects on pro-apoptosis Bad at protein as
well as mRNA levels. As shown in figure 5A, marked
increase were observed in Bad protein levels in the γT2
and MSA + γT1 group. In addition, at the mRNA levels,
we observed a trend of increased Bad level in all the
treatment groups; however, a significant increase was
found only in MSA + γT1 and MSA + γT2 groups (Figure
5B).

Figure 3: Effects of MSA and γT on Bax and Bcl2 proteins. At the termination of the experiment, the effects of the treatments

on Bax and Bcl2 proteins were determined using immunoblot analysis. 40 μg protein was separated on SDS-PAGE and immunobloted for
Bax (A) and Bcl2 (B) as detailed in ‘Materials and Methods’. The blots were reprobed for β-actin for loading control. Representative blots
are shown and the data (relative density normalized to β-actin) are expressed as mean ± 2 standard error of three replicates (representing 6
mice). Ratio of Bax/Bcl2 was also calculated and plotted (C) (*P<0.05).

Effects of MSA and/or γT on ApoE, SepP and
Nrf2 in 22Rν1 implanted prostate tumors

mind, we determined the effects of MSA and/or γT on the
expression level of ApoE. We found a significant reduction
in mRNA levels of ApoE in MSA + γT1 group only.
However, a decreasing trend was evident in MSA and γT1
groups. No change were noticed in the ApoE levels in γT2
and MSA + γT2 groups (Figure 6A).
Selenoprotein P (SepP) is the central protein in
blood that controls selenium transport and distribution,
and is responsible for the extracellular antioxidant
defense properties of selenium. A recent study showed a
downregulation of SepP in PCa which leads to decreased
cellular protection against oxidative damage [24]. Our
data demonstrated that compared to control, a marked
up-regulation of SepP occurs in all the treatment groups
except MSA (Figure 6B). However, the low dose of
γ-tocopherol (γT1 group) and its combination with MSA
(the MSA + γT1 group) was seemingly found to have the
best response among all the treatment groups.
One of the key pathways that cells use in the
antioxidant response to oxidative stress is headed by
nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). As MSA
and γ-tocopherol are both antioxidants, it makes sense
that these would affect levels of Nrf2. Down-regulation
of the transcription factor Nrf2 has been reported in
the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate
(TRAMP) model of PCa [25]. This information led us to
investigate the effects of MSA and γT on Nrf2 expression
level. As shown in figure 6C, we found a significant upregulation in Nrf2 levels in γT1 and MSA + γT1 treatment
groups only.
Taking all of the experimental data into
consideration, a clearly evident finding of our study is
that among the different treatment groups tested, the
MSA + γT1 group (MSA in combination with low dose of
γ-tocopherol) showed the most consistent and favorable
tumor inhibitory response.

Since cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in
determining the ultimate fate of a cell, we determined the
effects of MSA and/or γT on several important oxidative
stress regulators (viz. ApoE, SepP and Nrf2), which
have relevance to human PCa. An increased expression
of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been correlated directly
with Gleason score in human PCa tissues, hormone
independence as well as local and distant invasiveness
[22]. Further, in a separate study, increased concentrations
of plasma cholesterol and ApoE were shown in rats with
diets deficient in selenium and vitamin E [23]. With this in

DISCUSSION
The negative findings of SELECT were
disappointing and puzzling to many scientists, even
though selenium and vitamin E showed great promise in
treating PCa. Both of these agents have been shown to
possess anti-proliferative effects in a number of models
(reviewed in [8, 26]). In a recent review, we discussed
the studies done prior to and since the inception of
SELECT, as well as the parameters of the trial itself [8].
In this review, based on a wealth of available data, we
provided arguments to study the most effective doses and
formulations of selenium and vitamin E for their efficacy
against PCa [8]. The objective of our current investigation
was to ascertain the efficacy of two specific formulations
of selenium and vitamin E, MSA and γT, respectively,
against PCa in vivo. The rationale for selecting these
formulations was based on recent studies showing better

mRNA. At the termination of xenograft experiment, effects of

treatments on Bax and Bcl2 transcription were assessed by qRTPCR analyses. RNA from tumor tissue samples was isolated and
cDNA was made. qRT-PCR was run for Bax and Bcl2 as detailed
in ‘Materials and Methods’. GAPDH was used as endogenous
control. The qRT-PCR data are represented as relative mRNA
levels for Bax (A) and Bcl2 (B). Ratio of Bax/Bcl2 mRNA
was calculated and plotted (C). The data represented are mean

efficacy of γT over α-tocopherol [13-17] and MSA over
selenomethionine or selenite [18-20].
Similarly, the selected doses were also based on
published animal studies and human clinical trials. The
dose regimen used in our study corresponded to a human
equivalent daily dose of 142 µg/day for MSA and 72
or 142 mg/day for γT (based on 7 days/week), which
is significantly lower than those used in SELECT. The
conversion of doses between the two species is based on
calculations described elsewhere [27]. It is important to
mention here that unlike SELECT, which was a prevention
trial, our preclinical study represents an intervention trial.
Under the experimental conditions employed, we
found that compared to control, all the treatment groups
showed significant decreases in tumor volumes. However,
the tumor weight was significantly affected only in the γT2
and MSA + γT1 groups. We also found that only the MSA
and MSA + γT1 groups demonstrated significant decreases
in the serum levels of PSA. Thus, the MSA + γT1 group
that consists of MSA and the low dose of γ-tocopherol
demonstrated the most consistent response among all the
treatment groups. Interestingly, the combination with the
high γ-tocopherol dose (MSA + γT2 group) was not any
better that the combination with low dose γ-tocopherol
(MSA + γT1 group), and in some cases had less favorable
outcomes. Since there is an established correlation
between Ki-67 levels and the histopathological grade
of neoplasms [28], we also assessed the effects of MSA
and/or γT treatments on Ki-67 staining in tumor tissues.
We found a decreasing trend of Ki-67 immunostaining
with all treatments. However, because of large variation
among individual samples, it was not possible to reach any
meaningful conclusion in this qualitative analysis. Thus,
the tumor data together with PSA and Ki-67 data suggest

that a higher dose of γ-tocopherol may not be desirable.
This is also supported by a published study showing null
results for PCa incidence in the rat prostate treated with
relatively higher doses of selenium and/or vitamin E in
the form of l-selenomethionine and dl-α-tocopherol [29].
We were also interested in determining the
correlative involvement of Bcl2 family proteins in the
anti-proliferative response of MSA and/or γT in prostate
tumors. The rationale for determining the effects on Bcl2
family proteins is based on several studies showing that
they are differentially expressed in various malignancies
and are considered as useful prognostic biomarkers [3032]. In addition, we have earlier demonstrated that a
combination of MSA and +-alpha-tocopheryl succinate
enhances Bax/Bcl2 ratio and causes apoptosis of human
PCa cells in culture [30]. It is known that Bcl2 acts as
a pro-survival protein, whereas Bax and Bad have proapoptosis function. We found a significant increase in
Bax levels in γT2, MSA + γT1 and MSA + γT2 groups,
whereas Bcl2 levels were significantly down-regulated
in the MSA + γT1 group. Interestingly, Bcl2 was found
to be significantly up-regulated in MSA + γT2 (MSA
in combination with high dose of γ-tocopherol) group.
Further, we also found that only the MSA + γT1 tumors
shared a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and
enhanced pro-apoptosis Bad levels. These are important
observations because the Bax/Bcl2 ratio as well as
Bad dimerization with Bcl2 has been shown to play a
significant role in deciding the fate of a cell (death versus
survival) [30, 33].
As a final part of our study, we evaluated the effects
of MSA and/or γT on oxidative stress related markers
because oxidative stress plays a major role in PCa
initiation and progression [34, 35] and both MSA and

Figure 5: Effects of MSA and/or γT on Bad protein and mRNA. The effects of MSA and γT on pro-apoptosis Bad was analyzed

at protein as well as mRNA levels. For immunoblot analysis, 40 μg protein was separated on SDS-PAGE and immunobloted as detailed
in ‘Materials and Methods’. The blots were reprobed for β-actin for loading control. Relative protein expression of Bad was calculated
and plotted (A). Relative mRNA levels of Bad were assessed using qRT-PCR assay as detailed in ‘Materials and Methods’ (B). The data
represented are mean ± 2 standard error of three replicates (representing 6 mice) (*P<0.05).

γT are known antioxidants. We determined the effect of
MSA and/or γT on ApoE, which is the main apoprotein of
chylomicrons and is essential for the normal catabolism of
triglyceride-rich lipoprotein constituents. ApoE mediates
the binding, internalization, and catabolism of lipoprotein
particles and increased levels of ApoE have been noticed
in PCa tissues as well as in rats maintained on selenium
and vitamin E deficient diets [22, 23]. It has been shown
that the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PINs)
adjacent to clinically manifested cancer are positive for
ApoE, whereas more distant PINs are not, suggesting
the relevance of ApoE as a marker of aggressiveness in
human PCa [22]. Thus, our data showing a significant
transcriptional down-regulation of ApoE in the MSA +

γT1 groups is relevant to PCa.
We also analyzed the effects of treatments on
modulations in SepP, which is used by cells for selenium
transport, thereby allowing the cell to make use of
the antioxidative capacity of selenium. A recent study
demonstrated that SepP is reduced in 60.8% of human
prostate tumors as compared to benign prostates [24]. Our
data shows marked increase in SepP expression in γT1
and MSA + γT1 groups, favoring lower dose of γT over
a higher dose. Finally, we determined the effects of MSA
and γT on Nrf2, an important transcription factor that plays
a major role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis
[36]. Nrf2 activators are being appreciated as possible
pharmacological agents for PCa management. Selenium
compounds have been shown to increase Nrf2 in PCa
cells [37]. Further, Huang et al. have shown that Nrf2 is
epigenetically suppressed due to CpG hypermethylation in
TRAMP mouse prostate tumors [25]. Studies have shown
that dietary feeding of a γ-tocopherol-rich mixture of
tocopherols suppressed prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP
mice, and that this was associated with higher Nrf2
levels [17, 25]. In our study, we have found a significant
increase in Nrf2 in γT1 and MSA + γT1 treatment groups,
suggesting a favorable redox-modulation by these agents.
Taken together our data suggest that MSA and γT
are possibly better formulations of selenium and vitamin
E and lower dose of γT may be more useful than the high
dose regimens. This is especially important in view of the
fact that the extended follow-up of SELECT suggested
an association between vitamin E (high dose) intake and
PCa incidence [6]. We firmly believe that low doses of γT
as well as MSA could be beneficial for PCa and possibly
other redox associated conditions. The low dose regimens
(at or slightly above the recommended daily allowance
levels) of vitamin E as well as selenium (in the form
γT and MSA) may be most useful in cancer control in
prevention settings, where a continuous supplementation
could be useful in maintaining a redox balance in the
body. We suggest that further detailed preclinical studies
are needed to select the best possible formulations and
doses of selenium and vitamin E for PCa management,
both in prevention as well as intervention settings. In
this direction an extensive preclinical study in a human
relevant mouse model of PCa, such as Hi-Myc and/or Pten
deficient models, could be a step forward towards future
human clinical trials with these agents.

dark at 4°C.

Group 5: MSA + γT1; Group 6: MSA + γT2. Tumor
volume was measured weekly with a Vernier caliper using
the formula (π/6 x Length x Width x Height). The study
was terminated on 14th day from the treatment start date.
At this point, the mice were sacrificed, blood was collected
for prostate specific antigen (PSA) analysis, and tumors
were resected, photographed, weighed, and either flashfrozen for further protein and mRNA analysis, or fixed in
formalin for paraffin embedding and sectioning.

Cell culture

Immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67

The human PCa cell line 22Rν1 was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
cultured in RPMI-1640 (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) under standard
cell culture conditions (37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator). The cells used in our experiments were
purchased within 6 months from the start of the
experiments and were characterized at the ATCC via
observation and identity confirmed by Short Tandem
Repeat (STR) analysis.

The formalin fixed tissue specimens were processed,
embedded into paraffin, and sectioned at the University
of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC)
Experimental Pathology Core Laboratory. The slides
were deparaffinized using xylenes and graded ethanol
followed by antigen retrieval using IHC-Tek epitope
retrieval steamer set (IHC World, LLC.). Slides were then
blocked with 10% goat serum, incubated with primary
antibody against Ki-67 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)
followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and then
detected using DAB (3, 3’- diaminobenzidine) peroxidase
substrate kit (Vector Labs, Inc.). The tissue sections were
counterstained with Harris modified hematoxylin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.), dehydrated with graded ethanol and
xylene, and mounted with paramount diluted with xylene
(1:2 ratio). For images and intensity scoring, a trinocular
bright field Olympus BX41 microscope (Olympus Corp.
of the Americas) was used. Tissue cores were scored as
negative (0), weak (+), moderate (++), or strong (+++) by
staining intensity.

Nude mouse xenograft experiments
Housing and care of the animals was approved by
the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Eight week old
male Nu/J mice (The Jackson Laboratories, stock number
2019) were maintained at the Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)accredited Laboratory Animal Resource Facility at
the University of Wisconsin at standard conditions (in
microisolator cages under pathogen-free conditions with
12 h light/12 h dark schedule). The animals had ad libitum
access to irradiated diet (Catalog number 7912, Harlan
Teklad, Madison, WI) and water.
For implanting 22Rν1 tumors, the confluent cells
were harvested via trypsinization and resuspended in
RPMI-1640 serum free medium, and kept on ice until
injections. Just prior to implantation, 1x106 cells were
mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a 1:1 ratio
and subcutaneously injected into the right flank of each
mouse. The tumors were allowed to grow for 12 days,
and the mice were then divided into 6 groups (consisting
10 animals in each) keeping average baseline tumor
volume (~36 mm3) same for each experimental group.
The mice were administered methaneseleninic acid and/
or γ-tocopherol via oral gavage 5 days/week for 2 weeks
as described by Li et al. [18] employing the following
protocol: Group 1: control (vehicle alone; tocopherolstripped corn oil plus sterile water, 15 µL each); Group 2:
MSA (40.95 µg/kg body weight in 15 µL sterile water);

Immunoblot analysis
A small amount of tumor tissue (~100 mg) was
homogenized in 1X RIPA buffer (EMD Millipore Corp.)
containing 10 µL/mL protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 1 mM PMSF (Amresco, LLC)
using an Ultra-Turrax T25 Basic homogenizer (IKA
Works, Inc.). Protein was quantified using the BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). For immunoblot
analysis, equal amounts of proteins from three individual
tumors were pooled together to give one sample and 40 μg
of pooled protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5%
non-fat dry milk. The membrane was then probed with
primary antibodies against Bax, Bcl2 or Bad (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc.) followed by an appropriate secondary
HRP-conjugated antibody. The antigen-antibody complex
was developed using chemiluminescence detection
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), and images were captured
and densitometry analysis was performed using the Kodak
Image Station 4000MM (Carestream Health, Inc.).

Assay for PSA measurement

Statistical analysis

Quantitative measurement of PSA was performed in
serum samples of mice using the PSA (Human) enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit (Abnova Corp.)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. The assay system
uses a goat anti-PSA antibody directed against PSA for
solid phase immobilization. The serum samples were
allowed to react and the color intensity of the developed
reaction was measured at 450 nm using a Multiskan
MCC/340 micro-plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.).

The data were analyzed by our statistician
collaborators Thomas Havighurst and KyungMann Kim
using multiple statistical methods. Briefly, tumor volume
was recorded at three times: pre-treatment, and one and
two week post-treatment. Log-transformation was found
to be the most part appropriate test. Statistical analyses
on tumor data and serum PSA level were performed with
ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) models, examining
treatment as a two-way and one-way effect. The two-way
ANCOVA analysis did not show significant interaction
between MSA and γT. Therefore, the data were analyzed
with one-way design considering treatment groups as a
single factor. Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests, in
which only comparisons with controls are considered, was
used for post-hoc analysis. Mean data of 10 mice were
represented with ± standard errors for each estimated
mean.
The densitometry data of immunoblots were
analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA
followed by Dunnett’s test. The qRT-PCR data were
analyzed using StepOne Software v2.2 RQ Study (Life
Technologies Corp.), and CT (threshold cycle) value was
used for further statistical analysis. CT value is the cycle
number at which the fluorescence generated within a
reaction crosses the threshold line. The higher CT cycle is
associated with less cDNA in the sample at the outset. For
the purposes of testing differences, the quantity of interest
to be compared between treatment groups is the difference
between the CT value of target gene (the gene we are
interested in testing) and the CT value of the endogenous
control gene (the gene used to normalize the results). This
difference (known as ΔCT) was modeled and tested by
treatment group. It should be noted that a smaller ΔCT
corresponds to an increased gene expression. Similar to
immunoblot data, ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test was
used to calculate statistical differences.

Quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis
RNA was extracted from tumor tissue using
QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and first
strand cDNA was transcribed with random primers,
dNTPs and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega).
For qRT-PCR analysis, equal amount of cDNA from
two individual tumors were pooled together to give
one sample, and total of three samples (representing 6
mice) were analyzed. qRT-PCR was performed with
SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.)
with pooled first strand cDNA and appropriate forward
and reverse primers. The following primers were
used: Bax, F:5’-AGAGGATGATTGCCGCCGT-3’
and R:5-CAACCACCCTGGTCTTGGATC-3’ [30];
Bcl2,
F:5’-CATGTGTGTGGAGAGCGTCAA
-3’
and R:5’-ACAGTTCCACAAAGGCATCCC-3’ [30];
Bad, F:5’-CCGAGTGAGCAGGAAGACTC-3’ and
R: 5’-GGTAGGAGCTGTGGCGACT-3’ [38]; ApoE,
F:5’-TGCTCAGCTCCCAGGTCAC-3’
and
R:5’GCCTTCAACTCCTTCATGGTCT-3’ [39];
SepP,
F:5’-GTCTTCCCTCAGTAAGTACT-3’ and R:5’CTTCTCCACATTGCTGAGGT-3’ [24]; Nrf2, F:5’TGAAGCTCAGCTCGCATTGATCC-3’ and R:5’AAGATACAAGGTGCTGAGCCGCC-3’ [17]; GAPDH,
F:5’-TCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCGACAC-3’ and R:5’CACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTC-3’ [40]. The qRTPCR assays were performed on the StepOnePlus RealTime PCR System (Life Technologies Corp.). The samples
were initially denatured at 95°C for 20 seconds followed
by PCR amplification at 95°C for 3 seconds and 62°C for
30 seconds for 40 cycles. Purity of product was checked
using the melt curve analysis program which was defined
as 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 min and 95°C for 15
seconds with temperature increments of 0.3°C. Relative
quantification was analyzed using GAPDH as endogenous
control and ΔCT algorithm using StepOne Software v2.2
RQ Study (Life Technologies Corp.).
