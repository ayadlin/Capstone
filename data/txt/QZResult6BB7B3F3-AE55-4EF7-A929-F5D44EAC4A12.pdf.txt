Abstract
Advancement of many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies is frequently characterized by dissemination and homing
of cancer cells to the bone marrow (BM). Methods to quantitatively characterize these key steps of the metastatic cascade in
mammalian models are currently limited and do not offer opportunities to perform rapid, large-scale genomic, or drug screening.
Because of their optical clarity, we used zebraﬁsh to develop an in
vivo model of cancer cell dissemination and homing to the BM. We
performed intracardiac injection of multiple myeloma (MM) cells
derived from human BM or cell lines and monitored their migration to the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT), the region where

hematopoiesis occurs in the zebraﬁsh embryo, which recapitulates a BM-like niche. Transcriptomic analyses conﬁrmed that MM
cells homing to the CHT displayed gene-expression differences
compared with MM cells outside of the CHT, including signiﬁcant enrichment for genes known to regulate interleukin-6
(IL6) signaling, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis. Collectively,
our ﬁndings point to the zebraﬁsh as a valuable model in which
to study cancer cell homing to the hematopoietic niche and to
establish a screening platform for the identiﬁcation of factors
and mechanisms contributing to the early steps of bone metastasis. Cancer Res; 76(2); 463–71. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

progression and chemoresistance (1–12). For instance, the neutralization of CXCL12 within the BM niche reduces MM cell
dissemination within the BM, leading to inhibition of MM disease
progression (13). Thus, elucidating the mechanism of MM cell
homing to the BM is essential to better deﬁne the pathogenesis of
this disease and may be used to identify new therapeutic targets.
Therefore, there is a real need to develop new modalities to assess
MM tumor cell dissemination and homing to the BM.
To date, intravital two-photon and confocal microscopy have
been used to visualize cancer cells within murine BM by exposing
the BM within the calvarium of anesthetized animals (14). With
this technique, it is possible to visualize cancer cells that home to
the BM and establish contact with osteoblasts or the vasculature
(1, 2, 10, 14–16). However, this technique is invasive and has
limitations: (i) it is not quantitative; (ii) it cannot be used to
analyze for screening studies such as drug screens or functional
genomic studies such as shRNA or CRISPR screens; and (iii) it does
not allow the use of primary cancer cells, as it requires a large
number of tumor cells to be injected i.v. into the recipient mouse.
In addition, many cells are trapped in the pulmonary vasculature
and, therefore, precise quantiﬁcation of the number of tumor cells
reaching the BM and the assessment of any molecular alterations
in MM cells is not possible.
There is recent evidence that many cytokines and chemokines
are similar between zebraﬁsh and that of mammals such as
CXCL12, and that the hematopoietic role of the CXCR4–CXCL12
axis in zebraﬁsh mirrors the functional role of CXCR4–CXCL12 in
mammals (17). We therefore sought to develop a zebraﬁsh model
for assessment of tumor cell homing and metastasis to the BM by
injecting either MM cell lines or patient-derived MM cells into
zebraﬁsh embryos and demonstrating their homing to the caudal
hematopoietic tissue (CHT) where the HSCs migrate after their
emergence from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta: (18) This

Cell metastasis is a multistep process that involves several steps,
including cell invasion, egress, passage into the circulation, and
speciﬁc homing to predetermined distant tissues. The bone marrow (BM) is one of the most critical organs for cell dissemination
and cell metastasis in solid tumors such as prostate, breast and
lung cancers, and in hematologic cancers, including multiple
myeloma (MM) and leukemia. A similar process occurs with cell
trafﬁcking of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in and out of the
BM. MM represents a good model to examine homing to the BM as
it presents with multiple lesions in the BM by the time patients
present with their disease (1, 2). The interaction between tumor
cells and the surrounding BM microenvironment is essential for
MM cell proliferation and dissemination, leading to disease

posterior/caudal area is considered an early site of deﬁnitive
hematopoiesis analogous to the mammalian fetal liver (19).
This model requires a very low number of MM cells to be
injected (400 cells/embryo). We have demonstrated that the
injected MM cells home to the BM-like CHT niche. Importantly,
by performing RNA sequencing studies, we conﬁrmed that those
MM cells homing to the CHT present with speciﬁc changes in their
transcriptome level that enables them for tropism to the BM. This
accurately reﬂects the molecular alterations that are essential for
MM cell homing to the BM niche. We propose this as a new model
for studying mechanisms of cancer cell tropism to the BM. This
can be used in screening studies to identify novel regulators of
homing of cancer cells.

(16). In addition, GFPþ MM.1S were also tested. About 400 of the
labeled cells or GFPþ cells were injected in each embryo. In some
experiments, a mixture of cells labeled with either DiD (200 cells)
or DiO (200 cells) in a total volume of 2 nL were injected. For each
of the intracardiac injections, a total of 150 embryos were processed, with successful injection coupled with MM cell homing to
the CHT occurring in of 70.6 (10.3 SD) of the injected embryos.

Materials and Methods

Quantiﬁcation of migrated cells
Corrected total ﬂuorescence (CTCF) was calculated using
ImageJ software. The following formula was used to calculate
the CTCF: CTCF ¼ Integrated Density  (area of selected cell 
mean ﬂuorescence of background readings), as previously
reported (24, 25).

Patient samples, cell lines, and reagents
Tumor cell lines (MM.1S; MM.1S/GFPþ; BCWM.1; HeLa; MDAMB-231) as well as primary human myeloma (MM) cells were
used in these experiments. CD138þ MM cells were derived from
the BM of patients with MM (n ¼ 7) by adsorption and elution
from CD138-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech), as previously
described (2, 13). Approval for these studies was obtained from
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients and healthy
volunteers in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki protocol. Plerixafor was purchased from Selleckchem.
Gain- and loss-of-function studies
CXCR4, VLA4 and FAK genes were silenced in MM.1S cells with
lentiviral shRNAs obtained from The RNAi Consortium (Broad
Institute), as previously described (20). In addition, CXCR4 was
both silenced in BCWM.1, using shRNAs and lentivirus-mediated
infection and overexpressed using either precision LentiORF/
CXCR4 (CXCR4þ) or empty vector (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
The efﬁcacy of gene-silencing or gain-of-function studies was
evaluated by qRT-PCR as previously described (2).
Zebraﬁsh embryo homing model
All zebraﬁsh experiments were performed as approved by the
Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals. Embryos from the Casper (albino) strain of the zebraﬁsh, Danio Rerio,
were collected, staged, and raised at 28.5 C, according to standard experimental conditions. Embryos at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) were anesthetized using 0.04 mg/mL of tricaine
(Sigma-Aldrich), placed onto a modiﬁed agarose gel mold for
tumor cell microinjection. The tumor cell suspension was transferred using a micro-loader tip (Eppendorf) into a pre-pulled
borosilicate glass needle (outer diameter/inner diameter: 1/0.5
mm; Sutter Instrument) connected to a Pico-Injector Microinjection Systems (PLI-100A; Harvard Apparatus, Harvard Biosciences, Inc.). Subsequent injection was conducted under a
stereo-dissecting microscope (Leica, MZ75), via direct cardiac
puncture as previously reported (21–23).
Tumor cell labeling
Before injection, tumor cell lines (MM.1S, BCWM.1) and
CD138þ primary MM cells were labeled in vitro using the DiD
or DiO vibrant cell labeling solution (Life Technologies), at a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mmol/L in 0.1% BSA in RPMI-1640 for 30
minutes at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, as previously reported

464 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

Zebraﬁsh ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting
CD41-GFPlow zebraﬁsh HSCs were ﬂow-sorted from pooled
single cell suspensions of dissected kidneys from Tg(CD41:GFP)
ﬁsh, as previously described (18). Cell sorting was performed at
the HSCI-BIDMC Flow Cytometry Core Facility.

RNA extraction and RNA sequencing
RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Poly-A selection and cDNA synthesis were performed, followed by library
preparation using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation
Kit (Illumina). Because the original sample is a mixture of human
and zebraﬁsh RNA, we used the Agilent SureSelect Human All
Exon V5 Plus Kit to enrich human sequences. Libraries were
sequenced on an Illumina Miseq with 75-bp paired-end reads.
Bcbio_nextgen pipeline (https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbionextgen/) were used to process the RNA-seq data. Brieﬂy, cutadapt
(https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt/) was used to trim adapters and trimmed reads were aligned to a Human reference
genome (GRCh37) with TopHat2 (26). The read count for each
gene was calculated by HT-seq (27). Normalized gene expression
was expressed as fragments per kilobase of exon per million
fragments mapped (FPKM), and estimated by Cufﬂinks2 (28).
Data quality was assessed by RNA-SeQC (29).

Results
Homing of MM cells to the zebraﬁsh CHT
We injected GFPþMM.1S cells into zebraﬁsh embryos 48 hpf
(Fig. 1A), and assessed the ability of MM cells to enter the
peripheral circulation and then traced their homing to the trunk
region of zebraﬁsh embryos—an area referred to as the CHT. HSCs
are known to migrate to CHT (18), which is thought to be
analogous to the mammalian fetal liver and is the area of deﬁnitive hematopoiesis in embryonic/fetal life (19). This and other
observations suggest that zebraﬁsh and mammalian hematopoiesis are comparable with similar cell lineages and, most importantly, crucial genetic modulators have been conserved through
200 million years of independent evolution (30).
Intravital confocal microscopy revealed the localization of
GFPþMM.1S cells within the CHT area. Uninjected zebraﬁsh
emhryos were used as controls (Fig. 1B). We next performed
intracardiac injection of primary MM patient BM-derived
CD138þ cells that had been stained with either DiO or DiD and
demonstrated that primary MM cells also homed to CHT (Fig.
1C). We also conﬁrmed that DiO or DiD labeling did not affect the
migratory ability of MM cells. We injected DiD-labeled MM.1S

To further validate that MM cells actually homed to the CHT, we
injected DiO-labeled CD41-GFPlow zebraﬁsh HSCs that are
known to home to the CHT hematopoietic niche. We observed
that zebraﬁsh-derived CD41-HSCs homed to the same area as the

was restricted to MM cells, we injected DiD-labeled MM.1S cells

mixed, in equal number, with DiO-HeLa cells, and demonstrated
that the CHT area was colonized by MM cells but not by HeLa cells
(P < 0.001; Fig. 1E and F).
We have further investigated whether other bone-metastasizing tumor cell lines, such as breast cancer cell lines, would
home to the CHT niches, and found that intracardiac injection
of MDA-MB-231 led to their colonization of the CHT areas
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This indicates that MM cells, which

are known to home to the murine BM (2, 16, 31, 32), have the
ability to migrate to the zebraﬁsh CHT, similarly to other bonetropic tumor cells, whereas other cancer cells that do not home
to the BM were not able to home to CHT. These ﬁndings
recapitulate the BM homing process that has been previously
observed in mice (2, 16, 31, 32) and that occurs in patients with
MM.
RNA sequencing for studying MM cells interacting with the CHT
niches
We next investigated whether this model could be used to
analyze changes in the transcriptome of MM cells that have
homed to the CHT-niche. We performed intracardiac injection
of injected GFPþ/MM.1S cells, and selected only those zebraﬁsh
where MM cell homing to the CHT could be documented by
ﬂuorescence microscopy. A total of 60 zebraﬁsh were selected. We
carefully dissected the zebraﬁsh embryos to separate the CHT
from other tissue containing circulating nonadherent MM cells.
For these experiments, 20 zebraﬁsh were pooled into three separate pooled CHT and three pooled non-CHT samples and RNA
isolated from each of the six pooled samples (Fig. 2A). Given the
low number of human MM cells that homed to the CHT, we

anticipated a low amount of human transcripts, so we performed
whole human exome enrichment before sequencing of total RNA,
as previously reported (33). This approach led to an alignment
rate of 10% to 15%, with a high intragenic rate and exonic rate
(> 95%) and low mismatch rate (0.5%) for all the samples
(Supplementary Table S1).
It is well accepted that MM cells depend on the surrounding BM
microenvironment. For example, crucial factors that support the
clonal expansion of MM cells, are, among others, the release of
cytokines and chemokines that activate autocrine and paracrine
circuits of growth, the adhesion of the MM cells to BM mesenchymal stromal cells, as well as the induction of neoangiogenesis
(2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 20, 34–36). We therefore determined the geneexpression patterns of MM cells that homed to the CHT-niche and
compared them with MM cells that did not home to the CHT. MM
cells within the CHT had a signiﬁcant enrichment of genes related
to cytokine/chemokine–mediated signaling, IL6 pathway, cell–
cell adhesion, and angiogenesis, as shown by GSEA (FDR < 0.25;
P < 0.05; Fig. 2B). Overall, these ﬁndings indicate that the changes
observed in MM cells that have homed to the CHT mirror those
that are seen in MM cells in the human BM microenvironment
(2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 20, 34–36).

Model of MM Cell BM-homing Using Zebraﬁsh

Functional relevance of the zebraﬁsh model in the context of
MM
We next investigated whether zebraﬁsh use the same molecular mechanisms for cell homing as mammals. It is well known
that the CXCR4–CXCL12 axis plays a major role in supporting
the migration and adhesion of MM cells in the BM niche
(1, 16). Moreover, the homing of MM cells to the BM is also
regulated by additional factors, such as the activation of VLA-4
(37), an integrin expressed on MM cells and known to promote
their migration to the BM niche (38). Other factors to be taken
into consideration as modulators of the homing of tumor cells
to the BM, include focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that enhances
the localization and retention of B-lineage cells within the BM
niche (39).
To investigate the functional relevance of the zebraﬁsh model, we established CXCR4, VLA4 and FAK-silenced MM cells and
compared their ability to home to CHT with that of control
cells infected with a scrambled shRNA. The efﬁcacy of silencing
for each speciﬁc target was evaluated by qRT-PCR (P< 0.05;
Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). DiO-labeled-CXCR4-silenced
and DiO-labeled-scrambled-probe–infected MM cells were
mixed in equal numbers and subsequently injected into recipient zebraﬁsh. We found a signiﬁcant reduction in the number
of CXCR4-silenced MM cells homing to the CHT, compared
with the control cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). To further corroborate the CXCR4-dependent modulation of MM cell homing to
CHT, we treated MM.1S cells with AMD-3100 (Plerixafor) and
conﬁrmed that Plerixafor-mediated inhibition of CXCR4 also
inhibited the homing of MM cells as compared with vehicletreated control cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). We then examined
VLA4- and FAK–knockdown MM cells and observed that the
homing of MM cells to CHT was impaired when either VLA4 or
FAK cells were silenced (P < 0.001; Fig. 3C and D). All together,
these ﬁndings, therefore, conﬁrm that the proposed zebraﬁsh
model is functionally relevant to the biology of MM.
As a proof of concept, due to the demonstrated functional
importance of CXCR4, VLA4 and FAK in mediating MM cell
homing to the CHT niches, we next performed qRT-PCR for those
selected genes, and conﬁrmed that MM cells harvested from the
CHT areas expressed higher levels of CXCR4, VLA4 and FAK,
compared with MM cells harvested from non-CHT areas, thus
further conﬁrming the functional relevance of this model (P <
0.05; Fig. 3E).
Applicability and functional relevance of the zebraﬁsh model in
the context of another B-cell malignancy with speciﬁc tropism
to the BM
To further investigate whether tumor speciﬁc tropism to zebraﬁsh embryo CHT is applicable to other hematologic malignancies
that are known to home to the human and murine BM, we used a
cultured cell lined derived from a patient with Waldenstrom's
macroglobulinemia (WM; refs. 13, 37). We assessed the effect of
gain and loss of CXCR4 expression BCWM.1 cells of homing in
zebraﬁsh embryos. The efﬁcacy of CXCR4 silencing and overexpression was evaluated by qRT-PCR (P < 0.05; Supplementary
Fig. S3D and S3E). We then injected either CXCR4-overexpressing
or CXCR4-silenced WM cells and found that increased CXCR4
expression in WM cells led to enhanced CHT-homing of WM cells
(P<0.001; Fig. 4A), whereas the homing of CXCR4-silenced WM
cells to the CHT was reduced when compared with scrambled
control (P<0.001; Fig. 4B).

Discussion
The mechanisms by which MM cells and many other metastatic
tumors preferentially home to the BM are not well understood.
Bone metastasis represented nearly 70% of cases of metastasis in
breast and prostate cancer and approximately 15% of other
carcinomas such as lung, colon, and renal cell carcinoma. Most
hematologic malignancies preferentially trafﬁc to the BM. However, many of the factors that contribute to the selective homing of
cancer cells to the BM are not identiﬁed (1, 2, 16, 40). The MM
plasma cell–BM interaction favors MM cell growth and leads to
further dissemination and disease progression. It is, therefore,
important to deﬁne the interaction between the cancer cells and
the surrounding BM niche, to better understand those changes
that occur during the early dissemination and homing of these
cells. Here, we used MM as a model for BM dissemination and
metastasis. We used cell lines and patient samples demonstrating
that this model can be used for patient samples in a large screen to
identify subclones that have the propensity for cell dissemination
and metastasis to hematopoietic niches.
Previous reports have demonstrated the value of murine xenograft MM models, coupled with bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to
monitor tumor growth (2, 16, 31, 41–43). This is a good approach
for drug screens, but cannot be used for a large drug screen as it
would require a large number of mice and it can be used to
examine the effect of drugs on the early steps of homing and
engraftment. Similarly, other imaging modalities using to examine homing such as intravital confocal microscopy that permits
the visualization of cancer cells within the BM through the
calvarial bones of the mouse skull have been useful (2, 10, 13–
16, 32), but these techniques have limitations, including the lack
of ability to quantify the number of cells that disseminate to the
BM, loss of many of the injected cells by entrapment in lung tissue
and an inability to scale this model for high-throughput screening
with RNAi screen or drug screens. Moreover, repeated imaging of
the same mouse is limited by the development of scar tissue,
which may impair visualization of the BM.
To provide added resolution and ﬂexibility, we therefore developed a novel model for the study of early MM cell homing, by
injecting MM cells into zebraﬁsh embryos. This allowed us to
follow MM cell homing to a BM-like niche within a few minutes
after MM cell injection, and allowed the visualization of the
behavior of a very low number of tumor cells, as well as the ability
to study patient-derived MM cells. One other advantage of this
technique is that one can admix experimental (e.g., drug treated or
gene silenced) and control cells and compare their early BM
homing ability in the same animal. We have also shown here that
it is also possible to make accurate estimates of cell number in the
zebraﬁsh. Thus, this technique complements the murine model,
where the intravital confocal visualization of MM cells is possible,
but only after the injection of a much larger number of MM cells.
In addition, we were able to harvest MM cells from recipient
zebraﬁsh for RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis. The
changes observed in the MM cells following interaction with the
CHT-niche are identical to those that are usually seen after the
interaction of MM cells with the human BM microenvironment
(2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 20, 34–36). Indeed, enrichment for cytokine/
chemokine-, angiogenesis-, cell–cell adhesion–related mRNA
signatures was conﬁrmed in MM cells that had homed to the CHT.
It could be envisioned that this technique can also be used in
the future to identify at the single-cell level or subclonal level, cells

CXCR4, VLA4 and FAK silencing led to inhibited MM cell homing to the CHT-area. A, CXCR4 k.d. and control scrambled MM.1S cells were labeled with
DiO and DiD, respectively. The labeled cells were mixed in equal number and injected into recipient zebraﬁsh embryos 48 hpf (zebraﬁsh n ¼ 30 in
each group). Quantiﬁcation of the DiD-labeled scrambled control- and DiO-CXCR4 k.d cells within the CHT niche was performed by measuring the
corrected total ﬂuorescence using ImageJ software, showing signiﬁcant reduction in CHT inﬁltration of DiO-CXCR4 k.d. MM.1S cells compared with DiD-control
cells. B, DiO-labeled MM.1S cells were treated with plerixafor (20 mmol/L) for 4 hours. Untreated DiD-labeled MM.1S cells were used as control. DiO- and
DiD-labeled cells were mixed in equal number and injected into recipient zebraﬁsh embryos 48 hpf (zebraﬁsh n:30/each group). Quantiﬁcation of the
DiD-control cells and DiO-plerixafor–treated cells within the CHT niche was performed by measuring the corrected total ﬂuorescence using ImageJ software,
showing signiﬁcant reduction in CHT-inﬁltration of DiO-plerixafor–treated MM.1S cells compared with DiD-control cells. C, scrambled control MM.1S cells
were labeled with DiO and VLA4 k.d. MM.1S cells were labeled with DiD. DiO- and DiD-labeled cells were mixed in equal number and injected into recipient
zebraﬁsh embryos 48 hpf (zebraﬁsh n ¼ 30 in each group). Quantiﬁcation of the DiO-scrambled control and DiD-VLA4 k.d cells within the CHT niche was
performed by measuring the corrected total ﬂuorescence using ImageJ software, showing signiﬁcant reduction in CHT-inﬁltration of DiD-VLA4 k.d. MM.1S cells
compared with DiO-scrambled control cells. D, scrambled control MM.1S cells were labeled with DiD; FAK k.d. MM.1S cells were labeled with DiO. DiD- and
DiO-labeled cells were mixed in equal number and injected in recipient zebraﬁsh embryos 48 hpf (zebraﬁsh n ¼ 30 in each group). Quantiﬁcation of the DiDscrambled control and DiO-FAK k.d. cells within the CHT niche was performed by measuring the corrected total ﬂuorescence using ImageJ software, showing
signiﬁcant reduction in CHT-inﬁltration of DiO-FAK k.d. MM.1S cells compared with DiD-scrambled control cells. E, modulation of speciﬁc targets (CXCR4, VLA4 and
FAK) was demonstrated using MM.1S cells harvested from the CHT niche compared with MM.1S cells that did not home to the CHT niche, by qRT-PCR.

that have the propensity for homing and metastasis within a larger
tumor bulk or within primary tumor samples. Taken together,
these observations provide compelling evidence that intra-cardiac
injection of tumor cells into zebraﬁsh embryos is a useful new
technique for rapid screening of cancer cells that can home or
metastasize to the BM. In future studies, this approach might be
applied to the analysis of the dissemination and homing of other
cancers to identify molecular factors that regulate early cell dissemination and homing to the hematopoietic niche.
