BACKGROUND. The MOSAIC trial demonstrated that oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin (FU/LV) (FOLFOX4) as adjuvant treatment of TNM stage II and III colon cancer significantly improves disease-free survival compared with 5-FU/LV
alone. For stage III patients the 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 69% in the
FOLFOX4 arm vs 61% in the LV5FU2 arm, P ¼ .002). The cost-effectiveness of
FOLFOX4 in stage III patients was evaluated from a US Medicare perspective.

METHODS. By using individual patient-level data from the MOSAIC trial (median
follow-up: 44.2 months), DFS and overall survival (OS) were estimated up to 4

RESULTS. Patients on FOLFOX4 were predicted to gain 2.00 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.63, 3.37) years of DFS over those on 5-FU/LV. The predicted life
expectancy of stage III patients on FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV was 17.61 and 16.26
years, respectively. Mean total lifetime disease-related costs were $56,300 with
oxaliplatin and $39,300 with 5-FU/LV. Compared with 5-FU/LV, FOLFOX4 was
estimated to cost $20,600 per life-year gained and $22,800 per quality-adjusted
life-year (QALY) gained, discounting costs and outcomes at 3% per annum.
CONCLUSIONS. FOLFOX4 is likely to be cost-effective compared with 5-FU/LV in
the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compares favorably with other funded interventions in oncology.

Cost-Effectiveness of Oxaliplatin/Aballéa et al.

a median follow-up of 3 years, the addition of oxaliplatin reduced the risk of recurrence by 23% in
patients with stage II and III who had undergone
surgery for their primary tumor and 24% in stage III
patients. This benefit is confirmed for stage III
patients with a median follow-up of 4 years (25% risk
reduction).2
Increasingly, healthcare payers require evidence
of economic as well as clinical value. Economic
evaluations have shown that adjuvant 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) þ levamisole in stage III colon cancer is
highly cost-effective compared with surgery alone,3–5
whereas a modeled study suggests that the addition
of oxaliplatin to 5-FU/LV is incrementally cost-effective compared with 5-FU/LV alone.6 Our objective
was to confirm the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant
oxaliplatin using stage III patient-level data from the
MOSAIC trial and extrapolating these results to a
time horizon sufficiently distant to capture all costs
and outcomes of relevance.7

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This economic evaluation was a cost-effectiveness
analysis (CEA) comparing the FOLFOX4 regimen
against 5-FU/LV using individual patient data from
the MOSAIC trial. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 2246 randomized patients, including
40% of stage II (Dukes B2) and 60% of stage III (Dukes
C) patients. Consistent with the FDA-approved label,
this study considered the subgroup of 1347 stage III
patients, of which 672 were randomized to FOLFOX4
and 675 to 5-FU/LV (see baseline characteristics for
the stage III population in Table 1). Patients were
scheduled to receive 12 cycles of chemotherapy at 2week intervals with either of 2 regimens: 1) FOLFOX4:
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on Day 1, leucovorin 200 mg/m2
on Days 1 and 2, 5-FU bolus 400 mg/m2 and 5-FU
continuous infusion 600 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2. 2) 5FU/LV: leucovorin 200 mg/m2 and Days 1 and 2, 5-FU
bolus 400 mg/m2 and 5-FU continuous infusion
600 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2.
The outcome measures for the CEA were lifeyears, disease-free life-years, and quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs), estimated to a lifetime horizon. QALYs
were derived by weighting overall survival (OS) estimates by utility values representing preferences for
health states.7 Lifetime costs of colon cancer-related
healthcare resources were estimated from a US Medicare perspective. Outcomes and costs accruing beyond 1 year were discounted to present values at a
rate of 3% per annum.7 Incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on cost per lifeyear gained, cost per disease-free life-year gained,

and cost per QALY gained. All statistical analyses were
conducted with SAS v. 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Survival Estimation
The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free
survival (DFS). As the median period of trial followup was 44.2 months, OS for a full lifespan was
derived by extrapolating the trial data as follows. DFS
by group was estimated from 0 to 48 months by the
Kaplan-Meier method and extrapolated to 5 years by
fitting a parametric model to the tail of the curve for
patients alive and free of disease at 36 months, as
proposed by Gelber et al.8 After 5 years patients were
assumed in the base case to be no longer at risk of
recurrence, and all-cause mortality was the same as
in the US population adjusted for age and sex. This
assumption was based on longer-term follow-up
from another large study of adjuvant therapy in stage
III CRC.9 OS from 0 to 48 months was estimated
from empirical data by the Kaplan-Meier method. To
estimate OS beyond 48 months we derived a mathe-

matical relation between DFS and OS, making use of
the empirical data on survival time after recurrence
and its dependency on the disease-free period before
recurrence. In MOSAIC, 61% (252) of stage III
patients with recurrence died within the observation
period, which was deemed to provide sufficient information to estimate survival after recurrence parametrically. The survival function after recurrence was
modeled using a Weibull distribution, adjusted for
time of recurrence. Models were estimated separately
for each treatment arm and validated by confirming
that the predicted OS curve fell within the 95% confidence limits of the respective Kaplan-Meier estimates
over the 0 to 48-month period for which the latter
were available.

Outcomes
The mean number of disease-free years (DFYs) and
life-years (LYs) for patients in each arm was calculated as the areas under the DFS and OS curves,
respectively. They were calculated by partitioning the
analytic timespan into time intervals and summing
the probabilities of being alive at the beginning of
each interval multiplied by the duration of the interval. QALYs were calculated from DFS and OS by
weighting each survival in each interval by a utility
value for each possible health state.
We assigned utility weights, as shown in Table 2,
to allow quality adjustment of survival time. Following Ramsey et al.,10 who administered the HUI-3
questionnaire to 173 survivors of colorectal cancer,
we assigned a utility value of 0.85 to survivors and
applied a reduction of 0.2 to those with recurrence
for their remaining lifetime. We also applied utility
reductions for episodes of toxicity. From year 4
onwards, when the risk of recurrence has diminished, the utility value for disease-free survivors was
considered to be the same as that of the general
population. We applied EQ-5D utility norms by age
and sex derived from the 2001 Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS)11 and US population-based
preference weights12 to calculate a weighted average
utility for each year of follow-up.
Resource Utilization and Cost Estimation
We estimated costs incurred for resources used during and subsequent to trial follow-up, notably treatment of patients with recurrence. Resource utilization
during trial follow-up was derived from individual
patient history data. However, observations for many
patients were censored, so that subsequent costs and
recurrences were unknown. To avoid bias due to censoring we applied the cost history method developed
by Lin et al.13

Study chemotherapy costs were calculated using
doses actually administered. Drug administration resources included clinic attendances, infusion pumps,
and premedication. For each cycle the administration
cost was estimated at $547 for the FOLFOX4 arm and
$543 for the 5-FU/LV arm, based on 2 attendances,
1 infusion pump, and premedications including dexamethasone, 5HT3 inhibitors, calcium gluconate, and
magnesium. Second-line adjuvant chemotherapy costs,
for example, among patients who discontinued study
drug due to toxicity, were included as were costs of routine follow-up, further procedures, and management of
serious adverse events (SAEs) and toxicity recorded in
the trial case report forms. Resource utilization for toxicity episodes treated on an outpatient basis was estimated for individual patients based on standard
treatment for the management of nausea NCI CTC
Grade 2 or higher, leucopenia NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4,
and diarrhea NCI CTC Grade 2 or higher. Mean costs
of neurotoxicity episodes from a case series in ovarian
cancer were used as a proxy. In addition, the descriptions of each SAE episode were reviewed and assigned
to a Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG), from which we
deduced the corresponding Medicare Average National
Payment.
Costs were estimated from the US Medicare perspective using 2003 data. Unit cost data were
obtained from the Red Book for pharmaceuticals,
from the DRG System for hospitalizations, from the
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for physician services, and from the Medicare Hospital Outpatient
Prospective Payment System for outpatient procedures. For drugs administered in the hospital the average wholesale price (AWP) less 15% was applied,
reflecting Medicare reimbursement rates for these.

Cost-Effectiveness of Oxaliplatin/Aballéa et al.

The cost of a recurrence was estimated according to the type of recurrence (local recurrence, liver
metastasis, lung metastasis, or disseminated disease)
and treatment pathways for each, including the costs
of possible surgery and first-line and second-line
chemotherapy. Pathways and probabilities were determined using the literature and validated using
expert opinion. For recurrences observed during trial
follow-up, the type of recurrence was known and
costed accordingly; otherwise a weighted average
was used.

Economic Analysis
Expected mean costs and outcomes per patient were
calculated for each treatment for the within-trial period
(to 48 months), extrapolated to 60 months and then to
50 years. Mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) of cost per life-year gained, cost per DFY
gained, and cost per QALY gained were calculated.
The within-trial DFS data are sample estimates
with known variance. We estimated the uncertainty
in the resulting cost-effectiveness estimates by bootstrapping.14 Where input data were uncertain, we
separately estimated the impact of feasible alternative assumptions in the following sensitivity analyses:
1. We applied a more conservative assumption for
the survival of patients free of disease at 5 years,
in which the annual recurrence rate for both arms
declined from 1.5% at year 5, based on the Sargent
et al.15 pooled analysis of clinical trials.
2. In a permutation of the above, we assumed the
effect of FOLFOX4 persisted beyond the trial by
applying the relative risk reduction (RRR) of 24%
seen within trial to the post-year-5 recurrence rates.
3. We applied a set of assumptions leading to a lower
cost of managing recurrences: neither bevacizumab
nor cetuximab would be used, fewer (90%) instead of
all patients unfit for secondary resection would
receive further chemotherapy, and that only 70%
(instead of all) of patients undergoing secondary
resection would receive subsequent chemotherapy.
4. We used the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval
(CI) around the survival curves after recurrence in
both arms to assess the impact of a potential extension
of life expectancy after recurrence attributable to innovative treatments for metastatic disease.

FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV groups of stage III patients,
respectively. The DFS probability at 48 months was
69% and 61% for FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV, respectively
(log-rank test: P ¼ .002), equivalent to a mean gain
per patient of 0.21 DFYs.
There were 280 deaths in the stage III subgroup,
accounting for 80% of deaths in the overall trial
population, of which 132 were in patients on FOLFOX4 and 148 on 5-FU/LV. OS to 48 months was
78.2% and 76.6% for FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV, respectively, equivalent to a mean gain per patient on FOLFOX4 of 0.060 life-years. The OS difference did not
reach statistical significance (log-rank test: P ¼ .24).

Survival after recurrence
Among 411 cases of recurrence in the stage III subgroup, 252 (61%) died within the trial observation
period. The median survival after recurrence was
16.8 (95% CI: 15.3; 19.8) months, and 36-month survival rate after recurrence was 19.5%. Twenty-eight
stage III patients died during the trial without having
recurrence. Survival time after recurrence did not differ between treatments but was strongly associated
with the time of recurrence (log-rank test: P < .0001),
those with later recurrences surviving longer.
Extrapolated survival estimates
We extrapolated DFS to 5 years by fitting a Weibull
model to trial data for patients free of disease at 36
months. This predicted a gain of 0.084 DFYs per
patient at year 5. The estimated gain after 5 years
was 1.70 DFYs. The extrapolation of OS predicted a
gain of 0.038 life-years per patient at year 5 and 1.25
life-years per patient after year 5.
Hence, the OS estimates over a lifetime were
composed of 3 components: OS observed within-trial
to 4 years, extrapolated OS for year 5, and extrapolated OS beyond 5 years. Summing these, the estimated mean OS gain per patient on FOLFOX4 was
0.06 þ 0.04 þ 1.25 ¼ 1.35 years (95% CI: 0.04–2.66).
The majority of the gain was due to the predicted
impact on survival post 5 years. Applying the utility
weights and discount factors to the survival data, the
mean gain of 1.35 LYs was equivalent to 0.75 discounted QALYs (95% CI: 0.09–1.41).
Figure 1 shows the within-trial Kaplan–Meier
estimates of OS, with the 5-year estimates superimposed. The lifetime extrapolations beyond 5 years are
depicted in Figure 2.

Resource Use and Costs
Study chemotherapy, at approximately $29,000 per
patient in the FOLFOX4 group and $6,500 in the
comparator group, was the largest cost component.

Next most costly was resource use associated with
recurrence, with respective mean costs of $16,600
and $23,700 per patient. Hence, although oxaliplatin
added over $22,500 to the ingredient cost of chemotherapy, this was partially offset by savings of $7,100
because of the reduced numbers of recurrences.
Overall, patients on FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV incurred
mean estimated costs of $56,300 and $39,300, respectively, a difference of $17,000. These costs were
predicated on the incidence of recurrences and
the costs of recurrences, which were estimated at
$67,900 for a local recurrence, $62,400 for a liver metastasis, $61,000 for a lung metastasis, and $56,600
for other types of disseminated disease in the 5-FU/
LV arm, and lower by $2,400 for the FOLFOX4 arm,
as these patients were less likely to receive oxaliplatin postrecurrence. This gave a weighted average
standard cost of a recurrence of $61,200 for patients
receiving adjuvant 5-FU/LV as treatment and $58,800
for patients on adjuvant FOLFOX4. In the sensitivity
analysis in which lower proportions of patients were
assumed to receive chemotherapy and bevacizumab
and cetuximab were excluded from treatment options, while holding the survival prognosis constant,
the estimated mean cost of recurrence decreased to
$43,200 and $45,400 in the FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV
arms, respectively.

$12,900 per DFY gained, $20,600 per LY gained, and
$22,800 per QALY gained.
ICERs were also calculated for three alternative
scenarios, as follows. When post-5-year recurrence
rates as reported by Sargent et al.15 instead of zero
were assumed, the mean ICERs increased to $14,100
per DFY gained, $22,000 per LY gained, and $24,600
per QALY gained. When the treatment effect of oxaliplatin was assumed to persist beyond 5 years and
applied to Sargent et al.15 recurrence rates, the ICERs
decreased to $11,900 per DFY gained, $18,100 per LY
gained, and $20,400 per QALY gained. Under the
lower-cost scenario for postrecurrence chemotherapy,
the incremental cost increased to $19,264 and the
ICERs increased to $14,600 per DFY gained, $23,300
per LY gained, and $25,800 per QALY gained. When
the upper limit of the 95% CI around survival after
recurrence was used, life-expectancy after recurrence
was extended by approximately 8 months. As a
result, the number of life-years gained decreased
from 1.35 to 1.20 and the ICERs increased to $22,896
per life-year gained and $24,405 per QALY gained
(the incremental cost per DFY gained was not
affected).
A probabilistic analysis was conducted using the
bootstrap method to estimate the level of confidence
in the cost-effectiveness results, given the sampling
variability in the MOSAIC trial data. We found that
FOLFOX4 has a 91% to 96% probability of being
cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay (WTP)
of $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY gained.

DISCUSSION
Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by reducing the incidence of recurrence. After demonstration
of the benefit of bolus and infused 5-FU,16 various
regimens have been studied in the adjuvant setting.
The only positive studies have been MOSAIC1,17 and
the NSABP C-07 study,18 both comparing 5-FU to 5FU and oxaliplatin. Here we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the FOLFOX4 regimen in stage III patients
based on the MOSAIC data.
Key to this analysis is the value of DFS as a predictor of longer-term OS. The MOSAIC trial demonstrated a significant advantage of FOLFOX4 in DFS,
but not in OS. In fact, MOSAIC was not powered to
detect a difference in OS, but only to detect a difference in DFS at 3 years. However, a meta-analysis of
clinical trials on adjuvant colon cancer has shown
that DFS at 3 years is a strong predictor of OS at 5
years.19 On the basis of 16 comparative trials, Sargent
et al.19 found that the mean difference in 5-year OS
is equivalent to 0.85 times the difference in 3-year

1087

DFS. This prediction is more optimistic than those
we applied to the MOSAIC study, where despite a
DFS difference of approximately 7% (FOLFOX 72.2%
vs 5-FU/LV 65.3%) at 3 years,1 our projected difference in 5-year OS is 4% (FOLFOX 74.8% vs 5-FU/LV
70.8%). There are several possible explanations.
Recurrences may have been diagnosed earlier and
treatment of advanced disease improved since those
studies used by Sargent et al. to generate their formula. In addition, in MOSAIC, excess deaths not attributable to colon cancer recurrences occurred
during the early period of follow-up in the FOLFOX4
group. However, the difference in OS is predicted to
‘catch up’ partially with the DFS benefit by 5 years.
This is supported by the 4-year data: de Gramont
et al.2 reported a hazard ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.69–
1.08) for 4-year OS, which is comparable to the 0.85
hazard ratio predicted by the model when it is
applied over that period. As expected, the OS absolute difference has increased in sequential analyses
of stage III patients.17
The extrapolation beyond 4 years relies on 2 key
assumptions: that the survival function after recurrence estimated from the trial is representative of survival after recurrence in reality and that the survival of
nonrecurring patients is similar to the survival of the
general population, controlling for age and gender. On
the basis of data from the SEER registry, 88.4% of
patients alive 5 years after diagnosis of stage III colon
cancer were still alive at 10 years. In our model,
approximately 80% of all patients who were alive at 5
years and 89% of those who were free of recurrence at
5 years were still alive at 10 years.20 This suggests that
our assumption that nonrecurring patients have similar survival as the general population is realistic. The
former assumption, ie, that survival after recurrence in
the trial is representative of reality, is perhaps more
questionable, given the evolution of therapy in advanced disease. An increase in survival after recurrence
would reduce the life-expectancy gain associated with
FOLFOX4. However, in a scenario where mean survival
after recurrence was increased by 8 months, our analysis predicted that the impact on cost-effectiveness
would be rather small. As a possible point of comparison, it can be noted that the addition of bevacizumab
to the IFL regimen as first-line treatment of metastatic
colon cancer was shown to increase median survival
by approximately 5 months.21 Similarly, the median
survival of patients with previously untreated metastatic colon cancer was greater by 4.5 months in
patients treated with FOLFOX than in those treated
with IFL.22
The estimated CIs around the numbers of DFYs,
LYs, and QALYs gained over the trial period indicate

that these gains are not statistically significant. Comparing the lower limit of the difference in DFYs to zero
does not provide an appropriate test for the superiority
of FOLFOX in terms of DFS, as the power of this test
is low. Previous publications based on MOSAIC have
established that the difference in DFS between FOLFOX4 and 5-FU/LV is highly significant.1,17 As the risk
of recurrence beyond the trial time-horizon is small,
we concluded that it is reasonable to project diseasefree survival over the long term. The justification for
extrapolating gains in OS over a lifetime in the absence of significant observed difference in OS within
trial may be less apparent. However, as explained
above, the projected difference in OS after 4 years is
obtained as a direct consequence of the difference in
DFS (not OS) within trial.
We assumed that a proportion of patients with recurrence would receive biological therapies, although
in the absence of patient-level data from MOSAIC on
the treatment of advanced disease, we applied a standardized treatment pathway and duration for both
arms of the study. As noted by Schrag,23 the Mayo
clinic regimen costs $63, FOLFOX costs $11,889, and
FOLFOX combined with bevacizumab costs $21,033
per 8-week course, at 95% of the May 2004 average
wholesale price. However, patients are likely to remain
on regimens that include bevacizumab for longer,
partly as a result of increased survival.21 Accounting
for differential costs and survival in advanced disease
was beyond the scope of this study, but we explored a
scenario in which biologicals were not used, holding
survival constant. This resulted in a modest increase
in the ICER for FOLFOX4.
A difficulty encountered in performing economic
evaluation for the US as a whole is that the unit costs
of healthcare vary substantially across regions. The
approach taken here was to use average national
costs, in line with recommendations of the US Panel
on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.7 If
similar analyses were performed locally, the costeffectiveness results would show some variation, primarily because of the resources used subsequent to
recurrences and the unit costs of these. Another issue
with regard to the estimation of costs is that the
dataset contained little information about treatment
of toxicities. Importantly, all adverse events requiring
hospitalization were reported, with a description of
the cause. Thus, we were able to infer associated
costs on an individual basis by determining the DRG
corresponding to each cause of admission. However,
in the case of less serious toxicity, where hospital
admission (or prolongation of hospital stay) is not
required, the costs had to be predicted on the basis
of the assumed standard treatment. Whereas practice

may vary between physicians, the impact of variation
on the standard assumptions was very small. In the
base case analysis, costs of nonserious toxicity episodes (including neutropenia, nausea, diarrhea, and
neuropathy) accounted for less than 5% of the total
difference in costs. For example, we assumed that all
patients with grade 2 nausea received a 5-HT3 antagonist. If we assumed instead that this treatment was
only used in 50% of episodes of grade 2 nausea and
others were not treated, ICERs would vary by less
than 0.15%.
Cost-effectiveness analysis using QALYs offers
the opportunity to consider trade-offs between quantity and quality of survival, and we estimated the
impact of toxicity on QALYs. Although patients on
FOLFOX4 had a greater incidence of toxicity than
those on 5-FU/LV, the negative impact on QALYs was
greatly outweighed by the QALYs gained from reduction in recurrences and improved survival with FOLFOX4.
By using a threshold value of $50,000 per QALY,
the estimated probability that FOLFOX4 is cost-effective compared with 5-FU/LV is 91%. Although
$50,000 has widely been quoted as the minimum
value of a QALY in the US, based on the ‘dialysis
standard,’ others have argued that this is unrealistically low.24–26 We conclude that FOLFOX4 is costeffective in the adjuvant chemotherapy of stage III
colon cancer, compared with 2-drug regimens based
on 5-FU/LV with a probability of at least 91%. Confirmation of these findings awaits real-time followup, but in the meantime the adoption of FOLFOX4
appears to represent an efficient use of Medicare
resources. These conclusions are consistent with
those drawn from previous studies of the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal
cancer.4,27,28
In the MOSAIC study the difference in 4-year
DFS for those patients with high-risk stage II disease
was 5.4%.17 There is therefore a strong clinical case
for individual patients with high-risk stage II disease
to receive FOLFOX, although we have not examined
the cost-effectiveness of this scenario.
We conclude that the FOLFOX4 regimen is likely
to be cost-effective in adjuvant treatment of patients
with stage III colon cancer based on analysis of data
from the MOSAIC trial, with median follow-up of
44.2 months and extrapolation of outcomes and
costs over a lifetime.
