Abstract

Author Manuscript

15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is a key enzyme in prostaglandin
metabolism. This study provides important evidence for inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) growth by 15-PGDH through the 15-keto-PGE2/PPARγ/p21WAF1/Cip1 signaling pathway.
Forced overexpression of 15-PGDH inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro, whereas knockdown of
15-PGDH enhanced tumor growth parameters. In a tumor xenograft model in SCID mice,
inoculation of human HCC cells (Huh7) with overexpression of 15-PGDH led to significant
inhibition of tumor growth, while knockdown of 15-PGDH enhanced tumor growth. In a separate
tumor xenograft model in which mouse HCC cells (Hepa1-6) were inoculated into syngeneic
C57BL/6 mice, intratumoral injection of adenovirus vector expressing 15-PGDH (pAd-15-PGDH)
significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth. The anti-tumor effect of 15-PGDH is mediated
through its enzymatic product, 15-keto-PGE2, which serves as an endogenous PPARγ ligand.
Activation of PPARγ by 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 enhanced the association of PPARγ
with the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter and increased p21 expression and association with CDK2, CDK4
and PCNA. Depletion of p21 by shRNA reversed 15-PGDH-induced inhibition of HCC cell
growth; overexpression of p21 prevented 15-PGDH knockdown-induced tumor cell growth. These
results demonstrate a key 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-mediated activation of PPARγ and
p21WAF1/Cip1 signaling cascade that regulates hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver and its incidence is
rising in the United States and around the world(1–4). The tumorigenic process is
characterized by dysregulation of cell cycle progression and abnormal cell proliferation in
the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the liver parenchyma. Consistent with the
strong association between chronic inflammation and hepatocarcinogenesis, studies have
shown that mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins (PGs), play an important role
in hepatocarcinogenesis(5–7). Previous studies have been focused on defining the role of
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, a key enzyme that mediates prostaglandin synthesis) in HCC.
Indeed, the expression of COX-2 is increased in human and animal HCCs and in dysplastic
hepatocytes(5–7). In cultured HCC cells, forced overexpression of COX-2 increases tumor
cell growth and invasiveness. Selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors prevent HCC
cell growth in vitro and in animal models of hepatocarcinogenesis(5–7), although these
inhibitors are known to mediate effects through both COX-dependent and -independent
mechanisms. These findings suggest the possibility of targeting COX-2 for prevention and
treatment of HCC in patients. This approach is expected to be safe, given that selective
COX-2 inhibitors do not adversely affect renal function in cirrhosis(8, 9) (in contrast to
NSAID-related renal failure in decompensated cirrhosis). However, on the other hand, in
light of the increased cardiovascular side effect associated with some COX-2 inhibitors(10–
13), it is imperative to identify specific molecular targets downstream of COX-2 for
effective and safer anti-HCC therapy.

The amount of biologically active PGE2 is regulated by the balance of PGE2 synthesis and
degradation. The NAD+-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15–PGDH) is a
member of the short-chain nonmetalloenzyme alcohol dehydrogenase protein family, which
catalyzes oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE2, converting PGE2 into 15-ketoPGE2(14). This enzymatic reaction causes inactivation of PGE2, a pro-inflammatory and
pro-tumorigenic lipid mediator. Several recent studies suggest a tumor suppressive role of
15-PGDH in several non-hepatic cancers(15–23). However, to date, the action of 15-PGDH
is largely attributable to its degradation of biologically active PGE2, with its 15-keto
metabolite being considered largely inactive, and it remains unknown whether 15-PGDH is
implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Author Manuscript

This study was designed to examine the biological function and molecular mechanism of 15PGDH in hepatocellular carcinoma by using complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches.
We show herein that the anti-tumor effect of 15-PGDH is mediated through its enzymatic
product, 15-keto-PGE2, which activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ
(PPARγ) leading to p21WAF1/Cip1 expression and association with key downstream
molecules including CDKs and PCNA. Our data shift the current paradigm and disclose an
important 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-mediated activation of PPARγ and p21WAF1/Cip1
signaling axis that suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression.

RESULTS
15-PGDH inhibits HCC cell growth in vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine the role of 15-PGDH in HCC cell growth, we established human HCC cells
with stable overexpression or knockdown of 15-PHDH. Human HCC cell line (Huh7) was
stably transfected with the GFP control vector (pCMV6-AC-GFP), 15-PGDH expression
vector (pCMV6-AV-GFP-15PGDH), RNAi control vector (pGFP-V-RS), and 15-PGDH
RNAi vector (pGFP-V-RS-15PGDH), respectively; successful overexpression or
knockdown of 15-PGDH was confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blotting
(Figure 1A). Under immunofluorescence, the intensity of 15-PGDH staining was higher in
15-PGDH overexpressed cells and decreased in 15-PGDH knockdown cells. Under western
blotting analysis, the level of 15-PGDH protein was increased in Huh7 cells transfected with
the 15-PGDH overexpression vector (56KD GFP-15PGDH fusion protein) and decreased in
cells transfected with the 15-PGDH RNAi vector (29KD monomeric form, 58KD dimeric
form). The aforementioned stable cell lines were cultured in vitro and their growth curves
over time were measured by WST-1 assay. As shown in Figure 1B, overexpression of 15PGDH inhibited cell growth, whereas RNAi knockdown of 15-PGDH enhanced it. Flow
cytometry analysis showed that 15-PGDH overexpression increased the cells in G0/G1
phase (65.2±10.2% versus 42.1±9.7%, p < 0.05) and decreased the cells in S phase
(22.7±4.2% versus 47.3%±9.8, p < 0.01) (Figure 1C). In contrast, 15-PGDH knockdown
decreased the cells in G0/G1 phase (20.2% versus 45.2 %, p < 0.01) and increased the cells
in S phase (69.4 ±11.8% versus 45.1±10.9%, p < 0.05). The percentages of cells in G2 phase
were not significantly altered when 15-PGDH was overexpressed or knocked down.
Immunofluorescence for BrdU (a S phase marker) showed that the BrdU positive cells were
lower in 15-PGDH overexpressed cells (6.71±1.52% compared to 39.41±8.13% in the
corresponding control) and higher in 15-PGDH knockdown cells (81.84±13.24% compared
to 35.52±5.78% in the corresponding control) (Figure 1D). Soft agar clonogenic assay
showed that overexpression of 15-PGDH reduced clonogenic growth, whereas knockdown
of 15-PGDH enhanced it. The colony formation rates for the two mock Huh7 cells lines
were 23.4±4.5% and 24.5±6.2%, respectively, while the colony formation rate was
5.67±1.59% for 15-PGDH overexpressed cells and 61.4±11.87% for 15-PGDH knockdown
cells (Figure 1E). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that 15-PGDH signaling
induces HCC cell cycle arrest at G1/S transit and inhibits cell proliferation, DNA synthesis
and clonogenic growth.
15-PGDH inhibits HCC growth in SCID mice

Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of 15-PGDH signaling on HCC growth in vivo, the above four stable
Huh7 cell lines were inoculated into SCID mice and the animals were closely monitored for
tumor development. As shown in Figure 2A, 15-PGDH overexpression inhibited tumor
growth whereas 15-PGDH depletion accelerated growth. When 15-PGDH was
overexpressed, the tumor weight decreased to approximately one-third of the control group
(0.208±0.057g versus 0.748±0.153g, p < 0.01). Conversely, when 15-PGDH was knocked
down, the tumor weight increased approximately three fold compared to the control group
(2.311±0.498g versus 0.681±0.124g, p < 0.01). The tumor appearance time in 15-PGDH
overexpressed group was prolonged (15.13±4.27 days versus 8.12±3.24 days in the control

group, p < 0.01); in contrast the tumor appearance time in 15-PGDH knockdown group was
shortened (5.98±2.13 days versus 9.03±3.19 days in the control group, p < 0.01).
Immunohistochemical staining for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) showed
that the percentage of PCNA-positive cells was significantly lower in 15-PGDH
overexpressed tumors (18.24±2.99%) compared to the control group (36.83±9.51%, p <
0.01). In contrast, the percentage of PCNA-positive cells was significant higher in 15-PGDH
knockdown tumors (91.22±11.86%) compared to the control group (41.32±6.31%, p < 0.01)
(Figure 2B). Accordingly, western blotting confirmed that the level of PCNA was lower in
15-PGDH overexpressed tumors and higher in 15-PGDH knockdown tumors (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, 15-PGDH overexpression increased the expression level of the cyclin kinase
inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 in xenograft tumors, whereas 15-PGDH knockdown reduced it
(Figure 2C).

15-PGDH inhibits HCC growth in C57BL/6 mice

Author Manuscript

We next utilized a complementary syngeneic HCC xenograft model in which a murine HCC
cell line originated from C57BL/6 mouse strain (Hepa1-6) was inoculated subcutaneously at
armpit in C57BL/6J mice. When the tumors become palpable, an adenoviral vector
expressing 15-PGDH (pAd-15-PGDH) or the pAd control vector was directly injected into
the tumor modules (at three day interval, starting 10 days after inoculation till the end of the
experiment). The tumor size in the pAd-15-PGDH injected group was significantly smaller
compared to the pAd-control group (p < 0.01) (Figure 3A). The average tumor weight in
pAd-15-PGDH treated group was also significantly lower compared to the pAd control
group (0.57±0.12 grams versus 2.51±0.58 grams p < 0.01) (Figure 3B). Increased 15-PGDH
protein in pAd-15PGDH treated tumors was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Figure
3C). pAd-15PGDH treatment decreased PCNA expression in xenograft tumor cells (Figure
3D-E). Furthermore, treatment with pAd-15PGDH increased the level of p21WAF1/Cip1
(predominantly in the nuclei) (Figure 3E-F). These findings further demonstrate that 15PGDH inhibits the progression of HCC in vivo and suggest that a potential role of
p21WAF1/Cip1.
15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 activates PPARγ in HCC cells

Author Manuscript

We observed an inverse alteration of PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 metabolite levels in cells with
altered 15-PGDH expression. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, 15-PGDH overexpressed cells
exhibited decreased PGE2 and increased 15-keto-PGE2 metabolite, whereas 15-PGDH
knockdown cells had increased PGE2 and decreased 15-keto-PGE2. The level of COX-2 was
not changed in Huh7 cells with stable overexpression or knockdown of 15-PGDH (Figure
4C). These observations are in accordance with the enzymatic action of 15-PGDH
(converting PGE2 to 15-keto-PGE2). Consistent with activation of PPARγ by 15-keto-PGE2
in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts(24), we observed that 15-PGDH overexpression in HCC cells
increased PPARγ binding to PPRE (PPAR response element), whereas 15-PGDH
knockdown reduced the PPARγ binding to PPRE, as determined by EMSA (Figure 4D) and
by DNA pull down assay (Figure 4E). The involvement of 15-keto-PGE2 in 15-PGDHinduced PPARγ-PPRE binding in HCC cells was supported by the observation that the
effect was blocked by overexpression of PGR2 (15-oxoprostaglandin-Δ13-reductase), which
catalyzes the reaction converting 15-keto-PGE2 to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2. Consistent

with these findings, we found that 15-PGDH overexpression increased PPRE luciferase
reporter activity, whereas 15-PGDH knockdown reduced it (Figure 4F). The effect of 15PGDH on PPRE reporter activity was abolished when PGR2 was overexpressed or when the
cells were treated with 10µM GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist. Furthermore, treatment of wild
type Huh7 cells with 15-keto-PGE2 increased the PPRE reporter activity and the effect was
abolished by PGR2 overexpression or by GW9662 treatment (10µM). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 is able to activate PPARγ in HCC
cells.
15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 induces p21WAF1/Cip1 gene transcription through PPARγ

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

Given that 15-PGDH signaling increased p21WAF1/Cip1 expression (see Figures 2, 3 and 5)
and that PPARγ is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates target gene
expression through binding to PPRE, we postulated that PPARγ might be a key transcription
factor that mediates 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-induced p21WAF1/Cip1 expression in HCC
cells. Indeed, sequence alignment analysis revealed the presence of PPRE consensus
sequence [C(A/G)(A/G)A(A/T)CT] within the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (−2151 to −2145,
−1782 to −1188, −1186 to −1179, −1000 to −993). Consequently, we utilized a luciferase
reporter construct driven by the p21 gene promoter (from –2192 to +10, containing the
PPRE consensus sequences) to evaluate the impact of 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2 on p21
promoter activity. As shown in Figure 5A, 15-PGDH overexpression increased p21
promoter luciferase reporter activity, whereas 15-PGDH knockdown reduced it; this effect
was reversed by overexpression of PGR2 or by treatment with the PPARγ antagonist
GW9662 (10µM). Accordingly, treatment of the wild type Huh7 cells with 15-keto-PGE2
(10µM) significantly enhanced the p21 promoter reporter activity and this effect was
abolished by PGR2 overexpression or GW9662 treatment (10µM). These findings suggest
the involvement of PPARγ in 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-induced p21 gene transcription.
Consistent with these results, chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay showed that 15PGDH overexpression enhanced the binding of PPARγ to p21 promoter DNA, whereas 15PGDH knockdown reduced this interaction (Figure 5B and C). Overexpression of PGR2
reversed 15-PGDH-mediated interaction between PPARγ and p21 promoter DNA.
Treatment of wild type Huh7 cells with 15-keto-PGE2 (10µM) also enhanced PPARγ
association with the p21 promoter DNA and the effect was blocked by the PPARγ
antagonist GW9662 (10µM). Treatment of wild type Huh7 cells with the pharmacologic
PPARγ agonist, ciglitazone, also increased PPARγ association with the p21 promoter
(Figure 5D). These observations demonstrate that 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 induces
PPARγ association with the p21 promoter and enhances p21 transcription in HCC cells. This
assertion is further supported by the western blot analyses showing that the p21 protein and
phosphorylated p21 were increased in 15-PGDH overexpressed cells but decreased in 15PGDH knockdown cells (Figure 5E). The 15-PGDH-induced increase of p21 protein and
phosphorylated p21 was also influenced by PGR2 and PPARγ (attenuated by PGR2
overexpression or by PPARγ knockdown; enhanced by PPARγ overexpression). Taken
together, these results establish an important role of PPARγ in 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2induced p21 expression in HCC cells.

The effect of 15-PGDH on p21WAF1/Cip1 association with PCNA and CDKs in HCC cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Consistent with the notion that p21 inhibits PCNA and CDKs in the nucleus, Western
blotting analysis showed that 15-PGDH overexpression caused accumulation of p21 in the
nucleus and decrease of p21 in the cytoplasm (Figure 6A). In contrast, 15-PGDH
knockdown led to reduction of p21 in the nucleus and increase of p21 in the cytoplasm. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that 15-PGDH overexpression increased the
interaction between p21 and PCNA, whereas 15-PGDH knockdown inhibited their
interaction (Figure 6B). In parallel, 15-PGDH overexpression also increased p21 interaction
with CDK2, CyclinE, CDK4 and CyclinD1, whereas 15-PGDH knockdown inhibited these
interactions (Figure 6C and 6D). Furthermore, 15-PGDH overexpression enhanced E2F1
binding to RB and decreased E2F1 binding to C-myc, while an opposite pattern of
interactions was observed in cells with 15-PGDH knockdown (Figure 6E). These findings
demonstrate that 15-PGDH signaling influences p21 interaction with key cell cycleregulatory molecules.
Regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 by 15-PGDH is independent of p53 in HCC cells

Author Manuscript

Given that the expression of p21 in human cells is regulated by wild type p53, we performed
further experiments to determine whether p53 is implicated in 15-PGDH-mediated
regulation of p21 in HCC cells. To this end, we utilized HepG2 cell line that expresses wild
type p53 (Huh7 cells have p53 mutation). Western blotting analysis showed that shRNA
depletion of p53 did not alter 15-PGDH-induced p21 expression (nuclear accumulation and
cytoplasmic reduction), despite that p53 depletion reduced p21 protein in cells without 15PGDH overexpression (Figure 7A). Similarly, luciferase reporter activity assay showed that
shRNA depletion of p53 did not alter 15-PGDH-induced p21 promoter activity, although
p53 depletion reduced p21 promoter reporter activity in cells without 15-PGDH
overexpression (Figure 7B). Furthermore, p53 depletion did not influence 15-PGDHinduced interaction of p21 with CDK2, CDK4, PCNA and the interaction between E2F1 and
RB, although p53 depletion decreased the interactions of these molecules in cells without
15-PGDH overexpression (Figure 7C). Finally, CHIP assay showed that p53 depletion did
not alter 15-PGDH-induced PPARγ binding to the p21 promoter DNA, although p53
depletion reduced their binding in cells without 15-PGDH overexpression (Figure 7D).
These results suggest that 15-PGDH signaling upregulates p21 expression in HCC cells
through mechanisms independent of p53.
p21WAF1/Cip1 mediates the anti-tumor effect of 15-PGDH

Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the role of p21 in 15-PGDH-mediated anti-tumor effect, additional
experiments were performed to determine whether overexpression or knockdown of p21
would influence 15-PGDH-regulated cell growth. As shown in Figure 8A, knockdown of
p21 reversed 15-PGDH-induced inhibition of HCC cell proliferation and clonogeneic
growth. On the other hand, overexpression of p21 prevented cell proliferation and
clonogenic growth induced by 15-PGDH knockdown (Figure 8B). These results demonstrate
a key role of p21 in 15-PGDH-mediated inhibition of HCC cell growth.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Recent studies suggest an emerging role of 15-PGDH in several non-hepatic cancers(15–23,
25–29). Reduction of 15-PGDH is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and is an
independent predictor for poor survival in gastric adenocarcinoma(27). A haplotype in the
15-PGDH gene is positively associated with colorectal cancer risk(20). In mouse models of
colonic carcinogenesis, overexpression of 15-PGDH decreases cancer cell growth or delays
tumor formation, whereas deletion of 15-PGDH increases susceptibility to chemically or
genetically induced colon tumors(16). Targeted adenovirus-mediated delivery of 15-PGDH
gene inhibited colon cancer growth in a mouse xenograft model(30). The hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met signaling promotes PGE2 biogenesis in colorectal
cancer cells via up-regulation of COX-2 and down-regulation of 15-PGDH(31). Reciprocal
regulation between COX-2 and 15-PGDH expression has been documented in several
cancers(32). Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce the level of PGE2 in hepatocellular
carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma cells through down-regulation of COX-2 and induction
of 15-PGDH(33, 34). Anti-cancer therapeutics, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)β1, glucocorticoids and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, have been shown to exert
their anti-carcinogenic activity in part through induction of 15-PGDH expression(26, 35).
All of these findings suggest a tumor suppressive function of 15-PGDH. However, to date,
the action of 15-PGDH is largely attributable to its degradation of biologically active PGE2,
with its 15-keto metabolite being considered largely inactive. The current study provides
paradigm-shifting evidence for an active role of 15-keto-PGE2 in 15-PGDH-mediated
inhibition of cancer cell growth. Our results reveal that 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 is a
natural PPARγ ligand which induces PPARγ association with p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter and
enhances p21 gene expression leading to inhibition of HCC growth (illustrated in Figure 9).

p21WAF1/Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). It inhibits cell cycle
progression through binding to cyclin-cdk complexes(36–38). Association of p21 to cyclincdk complexes also prevents phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein thus
preventing the release of E2F transcription factor(39). In addition, p21 also binds to
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and interferes with PCNA-dependent DNA
polymerase activity leading to inhibition of DNA replication(40). The growth-inhibitory
action of p21 is attributed to the functions of the carboxy-terminal PCNA-binding domain as
well as the amino-terminal CDK-cyclin inhibitory domain(41, 42). Consistent with the
growth-inhibitory effect of p21, we have shown that 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2
induces p21 expression in HCC cells and this signaling pathway suppresses HCC cell
growth. The role of p21 in 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-mediated inhibition of HCC cell growth
is attested by the observations that p21 knockdown reversed 15-PGDH-induced inhibition of
tumor cell growth and that overexpression of p21 prevented the cell growth induced by 15PGDH knockdown.
PPARγ is a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor regulating the expression of target
genes by binding to PPRE in target genes(43, 44). The activity of PPARγ is regulated by
several ligands, including thiazolidinediones (such as ciglitazone), 15-deoxy-Δ12,14
prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), and other fatty acid derivatives. Our results in the current study
document a key role of PPARγ in mediating 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2 actions in HCC cells.

We have shown that 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 is an endogenous ligand that activates
PPARγ in HCC cells. Evidences for activation of PPARγ by 15-PGDH-derived 15-ketoPGE2 include: (1) 15-PGDH overexpression increased PPARγ binding to PPRE as
determined by EMSA and DNA pulldown assays; (2) 15-PGDH knockdown reduced
PPARγ binding to PPRE as determined by EMSA and DNA pulldown assays; (3) the effect
of 15-PGDH on PPARγ-PPRE binding was blocked by overexpression of PGR2, an enzyme
that converts 15-keto PGE2 to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2; (4) 15-PGDH overexpression
increased PPRE luciferase reporter activity; (5) 15-PGDH knockdown reduced PPRE
reporter activity; (6) the effect of 15-PGDH on PPRE reporter activity was abolished by
overexpression of PGR2 or by treatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662; (7) 15-ketoPGE2 increased PPRE reporter activity and the effect was abolished by PGR2
overexpression or by GW9662 treatment.

Author Manuscript

Another important finding in this study is that 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 increases
PPARγ association with p21 gene promoter thus enhancing p21 gene transcription.
Evidences supporting the role of PPARγ in 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-induced p21 gene
transcription include: (1) 15-PGDH overexpression increased PPARγ association with p21
promoter DNA and enhanced p21 luciferase reporter activity; (2) 15-PGDH knockdown
decreased PPARγ association with p21 promoter DNA and reduced p21 luciferase reporter
activity; (3) the effect of 15-PGDH on p21 promoter reporter activity and PPARγ binding
was reversed by overexpression of PGR2 or by treatment with the PPARγ antagonist
GW9662; (4) 15-keto-PGE2 treatment increased p21 promoter reporter activity/PPARγ
association and the effect was blocked by PGR2 overexpression or by GW9662 treatment;
(5) 15-PGDH overexpression increased p21 protein whereas 15-PGDH knockdown
decreased p21 protein; (6) the effect of 15-PGDH on p21 protein induction was influenced
by PGR2 and PPARγ.

Author Manuscript

The results of this study depict a key 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2/PPARγ/p21 signaling axis
that suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression. Since 15-PGDH converts
oncogenic PGE2 to tumor suppressive 15-keto-PGE2, induction of endogenous 15-PGDH
expression or delivery of exogenous 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2 may represent promising
future therapeutic interventions. It is conceivable that this approach may provide more
effective anti-tumor therapy with fewer side effects compared to the selective COX-2
inhibitors.

Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP, pCMV6-AV-GFP-15PGDH, pGFP-VRS, pGFP-V-RS-15PGDH using the transfection reagent LipofectamineR 2000 (Invitrogen)
(the plasmid constructs were obtained from Origene, Rockville, MD). Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the cells were cultured with the selection media containing 1-2 mg/ml
G418 (Calbiochem) for 15-PGDH overexpression or 1-2 µg/ml Puromycin (Invitrogen) for
15-PGDH knockdown. The selection media were replaced every 3 days. Distinct colony of
the surviving cells was transferred onto 96-well plate and the cells were continuously
maintained in the selection media. The transfection efficiency was verified by
immunofluorescence staining with anti-GFP antibody (1:200, Evrogen) and by Western
blotting with anti-15-PGDH antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotech).

To select cells with 15-PGDH overexpression plus p21 depletion, Huh7 cells stably
transfected with the 15-PGDH expression vector (pCMV6-GFP-AC-15PGDH) were
subsequently transfected with the p21 RNAi vector (pGFP-V-RS-WAF1/Cip1/p21, obtained
from Origene, Rockville, MD). The double transfection cells were selected by using G418
and Puromycin.

Addgene). The double transfection cells were selected by using Puromycin and G418.
Cell proliferation WST-1 assay

Author Manuscript

The cells were synchronized in G0 phase by serum deprivation and then released from
growth arrest by reexposure to complete medium with serum. Cell proliferation was detected
by reagent WST-1 kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer instruction. Cell growth curve
was based on the normalized values of OD450 and each point represents the mean of three
independent samples.
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Cell cycle distribution was determined by using flow cytometry. 5×106 cells in a 10 cm dish
were grown overnight. Then the cells were then kept in serum-deprived medium for 48 h for
synchronization to G0 phase. The cells were released from growth arrest by reexposure to
10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were collected by trypsinization followed by
centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of ice-cold PBS. The
collected cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol [in 50 mM glycine buffer (pH 2.0)] overnight
at −20°C. 100 µg/ml RNase A (Qiagen) was added to the cells with incubation for 30
minutes at 37°C. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml 100µg/ml propidium iodide (PI)
solution (Borhoringer Nannheim Co.) for staining. The stained cells were analyzed by a
FACScan Flow Cytometer at the LCRC FACS core facility. The percentage of cells in S,
G0/G1, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was determined using EXPO32 Cell Quest
software. All experiments were conducted in triplicate.

BrdU staining

Author Manuscript

80% confluent cells were cultured for 24 hour before treatment with 10µl BrdU (Roche) for
4 hours. Immunofluorescent staining with an anti-BrdU antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotech) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Becton Dickinson).
TRITC fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Abcam) was utilized to visualize
the anti-BrdU labeled cells.
Soft agar colony formation assay

Author Manuscript

103 cells were plated on a 10-cm dish containing 0.5% (down) and 0.35% (up) double layer
soft-agar. The dishes were incubated at 37°C in humidified incubator for 21 days. The cells
were fed 1–2 times per week with DMEM (Gibco BRL Life Technologies). The colonies
were stained with 2.5 ml of 0.005% Crystal Violet (Sigma) for more than 1 hour and the
numbers of colonies were tallied.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays are performed
according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology with modifications. The
WAF1/Cip1/p21 promoter PCR primer sequences are: P1: 5’GTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTTCTG-3’; P2: 5’-CTGAAAACAGGCAGCCCAAG-3’.
Additional details are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
DNA pull down

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed by sonication in HKMG buffer (10 mM HEPES, PH7.9, 100 mM KCl, 5
mM MgCl2, 100% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5% NP40) containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors for the preparation of nuclear exact. The nuclear extracts were
precleared with Streptavidin-agarose Resin (Thermo) for 1 hour and then incubated with 1µg
of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides (corresponding to the PPRE consensus site
in the p21 promoter): P1:5’-Biotin-AGGTCACTGGTCA-3’; P2:5’-TGACCAGTGACC-3’
(synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, USA), along with 10µg of poly(dI-dC)
(Sigma) for 24 hours. DNA-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin-agarose resin
and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis.
Luciferase reporter assay

Author Manuscript

Cells (1 × 105 per well in six-well plate) were transiently transfected with 1 µg of luciferase
construct (pGL3-PPRE or pGL3-WAF1/Cip1/p21 promoter) and 0.1 µg of pRL-Tk
(Addgene) using LipofectiamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) (with additionally plasmids as
indicated). 36 hours after transfection, the cells were harvested with lysis buffer and
luciferase activities of the cell extracts were measured using the dual luciferase assay system
(Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency with Renilla
luciferase activity.

according to the protocol approved by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. Six athymic SCID mice per group were injected subcutaneously at
the armpit area with Huh7 cells stably transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP, pCMV6-AVGFP-15PGDH, pGFP-V-RS, pGFP-V-RS-15PGDH, respectively (1×108 cells in 100µl of
PBS). The mice were observed over 4 weeks and then sacrificed to recover the tumors. The
wet weight of each tumor was determined. Portion of the tissue from each tumor was snapfrozen. Additional portion of each tumor was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded
in paraffin for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and for PCNA immunostain.
Xenograft tumor study in C57BL/6J mice

Author Manuscript

Mouse HCC cell line (Hepa1-6) (1×108 cells in 0.2 ml of PBS) was inoculated
subcutaneously at armpit into syngenetic C57BL/6J mice. The mice were divided into two
groups and subjected to intratumoral injection of pAd or pAd-15-PGDH (1010 pfu). The
diameters of the tumors were measured every three days and the tumor volume was
calculated using the formula V=L/2*w2. The mice were sacrificed 31 days after inoculation
to recover the tumor tissue. The wet weight of each tumor was determined for each mouse.
A portion of the tissue from each tumor was snap-frozen. Additional portion of each tumor
was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) stain and for PCNA immunostain.
Statistical analysis
The values are presented as mean±standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise noted,
with a minimum of three replicates. The results were evaluated by SPSS12.0 statistical soft
and Student’s t-test was used for comparisons, with p < 0.05 considered significant.
