Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tumour formation is blocked by two barriers, replicative senescence and crisis1. Senescence is
triggered by short telomeres and is bypassed by disruption of tumour suppressive pathways. After
senescence bypass, cells undergo crisis, during which almost all of the cells in the population die.
Cells that escape crisis harbor unstable genomes and other parameters of transformation. The
mechanism of cell death during crisis remained elusive. We show that cells in crisis undergo
spontaneous mitotic arrest, resulting in death during mitosis or in the following cell cycle. The
phenotype was induced by loss of p53 function, and suppressed by telomerase overexpression.
Telomere fusions triggered mitotic arrest in p53-compromised non-crisis cells, indicating such
fusions as the underlying cause. Exacerbation of mitotic telomere deprotection by partial TRF2
knockdown2 increased the ratio of cells that died during mitotic arrest and sensitized cancer cells
to mitotic poisons. We propose a crisis pathway wherein chromosome fusions induce mitotic
arrest, resulting in mitotic telomere deprotection and cell death, thereby eliminating precancerous
cells from the population.

Replicative senescence is induced by partially deprotected telomeres, which activate a DNA
damage response (DDR) without telomere fusions2. Crisis requires the bypass of senescence
through loss of checkpoints and causes massive cell death concomitant with further telomere
shortening and spontaneous telomere fusions. However, the mechanism of cell death was
not understood. Mitotic arrest is associated with spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)
independent telomere deprotection3, and we therefore set out to test whether prolonged
mitosis could play a role.

We monitored mitotic duration using live cell imaging. Mitosis in primary IMR-90
fibroblasts lasted <45 min. However, IMR-90 fibroblasts expressing HPV16 E6 and E7,
which inhibit p53 and Rb4, displayed variable mitotic duration upon senescence bypass (Fig.
1a, b). Prolonged mitosis, defined as mitosis of >2 h, became prominent in pre-crisis cells
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). Spontaneous mitotic arrest also occurred in pre-crisis cells
following expression of E6 or dominant-negative p53dd (Extended Data Fig. 1b), indicating
that loss of p53 function was required (Fig. 1c, d and Extended Data Fig. 1c, d).

Author Manuscript

Overexpressing hTERT5,6 prevented senescence in IMR-90 cells (Fig. 1c, d and Extended
Data Fig. 1c, d). Telomere elongation in IMR-90 E6E7 or p53dd cells also suppressed
mitotic arrest (Fig. 1e, f and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c), confirming telomere shortening as
the cause. Reversine inhibition of MPS17 suppressed mitotic arrest (Extended Data Fig. 1e),
indicating dependence on the SAC. Hesperadin, an Aurora B kinase inhibitor required for
activation of the SAC upon tensionless kinetochore-microtubule attachment8, suppressed
mitotic arrest (Extended Data Fig. 1e), suggesting abnormal kinetochore-microtubule
attachment.
To determine if telomere fusion causes mitotic arrest, we used two independent guide RNAs
(sgTRF2-1 and -2)9, which efficiently reduced TRF2 expression and induced telomere
fusions in young IMR-90 E6E7 cells (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2d, e). These guide
RNAs also led to mitotic arrest, comparable to IMR-90 E6E7 cells around PD108 (Fig. 2b
and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Suppression of both telomere fusion and mitotic arrest by a
resistant TRF2 (TRF2RsgRNA) excludes off-target effects (Fig. 2c, d and Extended Data Fig.
3a-c).

Author Manuscript

To address whether telomeric DDR or telomere fusion induces mitotic arrest, we deleted
TRF2 in young IMR-90 E6E7 cells lacking 53BP1 or Ligase 4 (Extended Data Fig. 3d,
e)10,11. Suppression of 53BP1 or Ligase 4 strongly reduced fusion frequency (Fig. 2e) and
prevented mitotic arrest (Fig. 2f, h), but did not reduce the number of deprotected telomeres
(Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 3f), thereby separating mitotic delay from DDR. Both
telomere fusion and mitotic arrest phenotypes were suppressed by ATM inhibitor12,13,14
(Extended Data Fig. 3g-j), again indicating that telomere fusion underlies mitotic arrest.
ATM inhibition did not suppress mitotic arrest induced by Taxol15 (Extended Data Fig. 3k
and l), confirming that the inhibitor does not perturb the SAC. Additionally, cells expressing
shTRF2-F, which causes telomere deprotection in the absence of fusion2, did not undergo
arrest (Fig. 2a, b and Extended Data Fig. 2e, f). These data are consistent with the
observation that senescent cells, while harboring a number of unfused deprotected
telomeres2,16 do not display mitotic arrest (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a).

Author Manuscript

Deletion of TRF2 increased anaphase bridge frequency and pericentrin foci (Extended Data
Fig. 4a, b) 7 d post infection, indicating multipolar mitosis when cells display telomere
fusions and mitotic arrest. Accordingly, sgTRF2-2 cells exhibit unaligned metaphase
chromosomes (Extended Data Fig. 4c), suggesting a chromosome congression defect.
Tetraploidy did not increase as dramatically as the pericentrin foci (Extended Data Fig. 4d),
ruling out tetraploidization and centrosome amplification due to anaphase bridges and
cytokinesis failure, as the cause of multipolarity. We conclude that multipolarity contributes

to the mitotic arrest phenotype, although it is not clear how telomere fusions drive
centrosome abnormality.
Mitotic arrest in young IMR-90 cells induces mitotic telomere deprotection3. To examine
whether spontaneous mitotic arrest in pre-crisis cells also induces telomere deprotection we
used premature sister separation, either cause or consequence of mitotic arrest17,18, as a
marker of prolonged mitosis. Indeed, cells in pre-crisis displayed increased premature
chromatid separation (Fig. 3a). Telomeric γ-H2AX foci analysis (meta-TIF)19,20 revealed
that metaphase spreads with separated chromatids displayed increased telomere deprotection
(Fig. 3b, c and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Accordingly, suppression of TRF2 in young IMR90
E6E7 cells not only caused fusion and prolonged mitosis (Fig. 2a, b), but also increased
premature separation (Extended Data Fig 5b).

Author Manuscript

Cells exhibiting premature separation were mostly near-diploid, excluding the possibility
that they have an increased number of telomeric ends (Extended Data Fig. 5c). We conclude
that prolonged mitosis in pre-crisis is associated with a telomere DDR and that mitotic arrest
occurs in near-diploid cells. Consistently the ratio of tetraploid cells in pre-crisis cultures did
not increase as prominently as the percentage of cells undergoing mitotic arrest (Extended
Data Fig. 5d, e). We also hardly observed diplochromosomes, which are a consequence of
two rounds of DNA replication without mitosis (endoreduplication) and thereby tetraploid
(Fig. 3a).

Author Manuscript

Next we asked how prolonged mitotic arrest affects cellular fate in pre-crisis. Live cell
imaging indicated three potential outcomes: cytokinesis, slippage (mitotic exit without
cytokinesis), and cell death (Fig. 3d)21. Mitotic duration correlated with cellular fate, as cells
that spent the least amount of time in mitosis underwent cytokinesis, and cells that resided
longer in mitosis tended to slip or die (Fig. 3e). The cell death ratio increased significantly
from 19% in cells arrested for 2 – 6 h to 50% in cells arrested for 6 – 10 h and to 69% in
cells arrested >10 h (Fig. 3f).

Author Manuscript

However, we noted that cells also died during interphase. Live cell imaging revealed that
32% (86/266) of death occurred after prolonged mitosis (>2 h), 14% (38/266) of cells died
during mitosis lasting <2 h and 53% (142/266) of cells died in interphase (Fig. 3g). To
address whether cells that died during a short mitosis or interphase were associated with
prolonged mitosis in the previous cell cycle, we traced the cells in question to the mitosis
before death. Of the cells that succumb in interphase, 46% of the traceable previous mitosis
was prolonged (18/39) (Fig. 3g). Of the cells that died during a short mitosis, 29% of the
previous mitosis was prolonged (4/14) (Fig. 3g), indicating that cell death during either short
mitosis or in interphase follows prolonged mitosis in the previous cycle.
Partial knockdown of TRF2 exacerbates mitotic telomere deprotection in young IMR-90
E6E7 cells2. To understand whether mitotic telomere deprotection is the cause of death in
pre-crisis, we tested whether a partial knockdown of TRF2 would enhance cell death upon
spontaneous mitotic arrest. IMR-90 E6E7 cells were transduced with shTRF2-F at PD45,
PD70 or PD852 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The resulting partial suppression of TRF2 did not
affect cell growth dynamics in the younger populations, but slowed down growth in the

population infected at PD85 (Fig. 4a-c). However, in all settings, the cells entered crisis
prematurely (Fig. 4a-c). γ-H2AX foci analysis around PD100 revealed that shTRF2-F cells
suffer from increased numbers of TIF, which was greatly enhanced on separated chromatids
(Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). Accordingly, live cell imaging revealed shTRF2-F
expression increased the cell death ratio especially after a short period of mitotic arrest (Fig.
4e). In contrast, TRF2 overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 6d), which partially suppresses
mitotic telomere deprotection3, reduced cell death after mitotic arrest, suppressed TIF and
delayed crisis (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f, g). Neither shTRF2-F nor TRF2 overexpression
affected mitotic duration (Extended Data Fig. 6h, i). shTRF2-F also did not increase fusion
frequency (Extended Data Fig. 6j), thereby attributing the increased cell death to
exaggerated loss of TRF2, not to increased fusion formation. Accordingly, loss of TRF2 in
cells lacking 53BP1 significantly increased cell death and shortened the mitotic duration
prior to cell death upon colcemid-induced mitotic arrest (Extended Data Fig. 3d and 7a, b).
Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora B kinase by hesperadin, which suppresses mitotic
telomere deprotection3 (Extended Data Fig. 7c), greatly reduced cell death upon colcemid
exposure (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e), supporting a model, where amplified telomere
deprotection induced by mitotic arrest triggers cell death.
This model predicts that shTRF2-F would sensitize cells to drugs that induce mitotic arrest.
Therefore HT1080 6TG cells expressing sh-scramble or shTRF2-F were exposed to Taxol,
vinblastine, dimethyl-enastron22 and as a control the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin.
Expression of shTRF2-F significantly sensitized HT1080 6TG cells to Taxol, vinblastine,
and dimethyl-enastron, all of which induce mitotic arrest (Fig. 4f). No such effect was
observed upon exposure to camptothecin (Fig. 4f), confirming that TRF2 levels affect
cellular fate specifically upon mitotic arrest.

Here we show that chromosome end-to-end fusions during crisis cause spontaneous mitotic
arrest, amplifying telomere deprotection, which determines cellular fate. We suggest that
telomere deprotection upon spontaneous mitotic arrest is the underlying molecular signal
that leads to cell death in crisis (Fig. 4g). While we cannot rule out a role of fusion breakage
cycles and the resulting chromosomal abnormalities as cause of death23, several
observations argue against it: Only few fusions are observed in crisis cells (Fig. 2a), which is
enough to trigger prolonged mitosis (Fig. 2b). Disruption of TRF2 leads to the rapid onset of
prolonged mitosis, arguing against long-term effects of fusion breakage cycles (Fig. 2a).
Cells succumb to death in the first prolonged mitosis, or in the following cell cycle (Fig. 3f,
g), ruling out a long-term process. Increasing damage signals without increasing fusion
frequency causes more death (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig 7a), arguing for signaling from
deprotected telomeres as the cause for death. Since most cell death during pre-crisis is
associated with mitotic arrest, we propose that prolonged mitosis is the main mechanism that
limits cellular life span upon bypass of senescence. These findings might also offer a clinical
opportunity, since exacerbation of mitotic telomere deprotection sensitises cancer cells to
mitotic drugs. Mitotic arrest, however, has also been associated with tumourigenesis in
checkpoint-compromised cells24. Similarly, bone marrow failure and cancer in individuals
with telomeropathies are frequent, which could potentially be explained by mitotic arrest
resulting from overly short telomeres25,26. Telomere-driven spontaneous mitotic arrest and
the resulting mitotic telomere deprotection in the pre-crisis stage may thus function as a

Methods
Cell culture and treatment

Author Manuscript

Human IMR-90 primary lung fibroblasts (ATCC) and their derivatives were grown in
Glutamax-DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 0.1 mM nonessential Amino Acids and 15%
Fetal Bovine Serum. HT1080 6TG cells were grown in Glutamax-DMEM supplemented
with 0.1 mM Nonessential Amino Acids and 10% Bovine Growth Serum. All cells were
grown at 7.5% CO2 and 3% O2. Colcemid (Life Technologies), Taxol (A. G. Scientific),
vinblastine (A. G. Scientific), dimethylenastron (A. G. Scientific), hesperadin (Selleck),
reversine (Selleck) and camptothecin (Selleck) were used at indicated concentration. ATM
inhibitor (KU-55933) (Tocris) was used at 10 μM. FACS analysis was performed as
described27. Cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination and found negative.
Live cell imaging

Author Manuscript

Live-imaging was performed in 8 well µ-slide chambers (iBidi) on a Zeiss inverted
fluorescent microscope with a 20× 0.8NA air objective at 37°C and 7.5% CO2 (XLmulti S1
module, Zeiss). Images were captured with an AxioCam MRm (Zeiss) using Axio Vision
software (Zeiss) typically every 6 min for at least 48 h. Mitotic duration was defined as
movie frames from nuclear envelope break down or a previous frame of cell rounding to a
frame of cytokinesis, slippage or mitotic cell death. Prolonged mitosis was defined as a
mitosis that continues for more than 2 h. Cells that escaped from a movie screen during
prolonged mitosis were included in the mitotic duration analysis but excluded from the cell
fate analysis.
For shTRF2-F, image capture was started 5 d after infection. For sgEMPTY, sgTRF2-1 and
sgTRF2-2, image capture was started 7 d after infection. Where indicated, population
doubling is the one at their seeding, typically 1 d prior to the starting date of image capture.
Typically more than 2 independent movies were analyzed to confirm reproducibility except
for Fig.1b, where one movie was analyzed per data point. Where indicated, Taxol, colcemid
and hesperadin were added to the culture right before starting live imaging.

Statistical methods

Author Manuscript

Each figure legend shows number of samples per experiment and number of experiments
that were analysed independently. Two-tailed unpaired t-test and two-tailed Mann-Whitney
tests were used to compare two data sets, where Gaussian distribution is assumed and not
assumed, respectively. To detect trend among multiple data sets in Fig. 3a, Extended Data
Fig. 5a, and Extended Data Fig. 7c, one-way ANOVA was used. Mitotic duration data sets
of IMR-90 E6E7 cells in Fig. 1b were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis test to detect trend
(P<0.0001), in addition to Mann-Whitney test as described above. For statistical analysis of
cellular fate after mitotic arrest, ratio of death versus non-death (cytokinesis and slippage)
were analysed by two-tailed Fisher's exact test. For Fig. 3f, data from short (2 – 6 h) and
middle mitotic arrest (6 – 10 h) were combined and compared to that of long mitotic arrest
(>10 h). The null hypothesis was rejected when P values were less than 0.05. No
randomization was performed. All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 6 software.
