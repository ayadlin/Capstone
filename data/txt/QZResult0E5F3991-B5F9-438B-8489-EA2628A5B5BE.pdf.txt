ABSTRACT
The emergence of the mobilized colistin resistance gene, representing a novel
mechanism for bacterial drug resistance, challenges the last resort against the severe
infections by Gram-negative bacteria with multi-drug resistances. Very recently, we
showed the diversity in the mcr-1-carrying plasmid reservoirs from the gut microbiota.
Here, we reported that a similar but more complex scenario is present in the healthy
swine populations, Southern China, 2016. Amongst the 1026 pieces of Escherichia coli
isolates from 3 different pig farms, 302 E. coli isolates were determined to be positive
for the mcr-1 gene (30%, 302/1026). Multi-locus sequence typing assigned no less
than 11 kinds of sequence types including one novel Sequence Type to these mcr1-positive strains. PCR analyses combined with the direct DNA sequencing revealed
unexpected complexity of the mcr-1-harbouring plasmids whose backbones are at
least grouped into 6 types four of which are new. Transcriptional analyses showed
that the mcr-1 promoter of different origins exhibits similar activity. It seems likely
that complex dissemination of the diversified mcr-1-bearing plasmids occurs amongst
the various ST E. coli inhabiting the healthy swine populations, in Southern China.

INTRODUCTION

of defense against lethal infections by Gram-negative
pathogens with pan-drug resistance [1]. However, it
seems likely that this ultimate line of refuge antibiotics
(polymyxin), has been challenged by the emergence of
colistin resistance mechanisms [1, 5]. Among them, one
refers to the chromosome-encoded machinery (two sets
of bacterial two-component systems [pmrAB [6] and
phoPQ [7]) and the regulator mgrB [7] are implicated in
K. pneumoniae [7], and the other denotes the plasmidmobilized colistin resistance (MCR-1) in certain species
of Enterobacteriaceae, e.g.: E. coli [8]. The above two
mechanisms are responsible for chemical modification of
the lipid A on bacterial LPS, which consequently resulting
in the reduced affinity for the polymyxin [8].
The mcr-1 gene defines a newly-emerging
mechanism for plasmid-mediated transferable colistin

Antibiotic resistance (referred to bacterial drug
resistance here) has already developed into a leading
problem in global public health [1]. The notorious New
Delhi β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing super-bugs
that was initially found in India, Pakistan and the UK
[2] had ever pushed us on the cusp of post-antibiotics
era. The prevalence of NDM-1 in the Gram-negative
Enterobactereae including E. coli and Klebsiella
pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) confers the robust resistance
to carbapenems and the expanded-spectrum (or thirdgeneration) cephalosporins, the two extensively-used
antibiotics for treatments of multidrug-resistant bacteria
[3, 4]. The polymyxin E (colistin), a family of cationic
polypeptide antibiotics, might represent the last line

resistance [8]. The mcr-1 protein product, MCR-1, is
predicted to be an integral membrane protein with the
catalytic activity of phosphoethanolamine transferases
[9]. The MCR-1 enzyme modifies the chemical structure
of lipid A moiety on bacterial LPS by the addition of
phosphoethanolamine, which in turn reduces the binding
affinity to colistin (i.e., producing the colistin resistance)
[8, 9]. Since the first discovery of MCR-1 from Southern
China, in the late of 2015, the new colistin resistance gene
has spread to 5 of 7 continents [10]. A retrospective study
by Shen et al. [11] reported that the mcr-1 gene is detected
in three chicken E. coli isolates derived from the 1980s,
when colisitin first started to be used in food-producing
animals in China. It suggested that the emergence of
the MCR-1 is much earlier than we anticipated [11].
To the best of our knowledge, no less than six species
of Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli [9, 12-14], Enterobacter
aerogenes [15], Enterobacter cloacae [15], K. pneumonia
[16-18], Salmonella enterica [19-21] , and Shigella somnei
[22] are recipient hosts for the mcr-1-harbouring plasmids
[10]. In particular, the MCR-1-producing plasmids display
unexpected diversity, indicating the complexity of the
MCR-1 dissemination mechanism [9]. The whole genome
sequences of diversified mcr-1-carrying plasmids allowed
us to better understand the mechanisms for the origin,

evolution, transfer and dissemination of the mcr-1 colistin
resistance [13, 23-25].
Given the fact that 1) Guangdong province of China
is the first place where the mcr-1 gene was discovered
[8]; 2) We observed that unexpected diversity in the
mcr-1-harbouring plasmid reservoirs is present in the
gut microbiota from the diarrhea patients in Shenzhen
city localized in the same province Guangdong [9];
3) Guangdong is one of the largest province for pig
production in China, we therefore attempted to address
the possibility whether complex dissemination of the
MCR-1 colistin resistance by the diversified mcr-1-bearing
plasmids is widespread in E. coli with different sequence
types from healthy pig populations. In this paper, we
report that this is the case.

Huidong County, respectively (Figure 1B). Each city
hosted numbers of pig farms. In principle, nasal fluid and
fecal samples were collected from piglets, fattening pigs
and sows. The enteric bacteria were selectively screened
on the MacConkey Agar plates, and the resultant single
colonies were further subjected to the propagation in the
liquid LB media (not shown). Subsequently, we conducted
PCR screen for the presence of the mcr-1 gene amongst
the bacterial species. As expected, the mcr-1-positive
isolates were found in the above three cities/counties
(Figure 1C). Direct DNA sequencing results revealed that
the mcr-1 gene from hundreds of bacterial isolates is in
100% identity. Unlike the mcr-1.2, a variant (Q3L) of the
mcr-1 gene [16], we indeed failed to observe any alleic
variants. 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic analyses proved
that all the mcr-1-positive isolates are E. coli (not shown).
As a result, 302 of 1026 E. coli isolates from the 3 distant
pig farms were confirmed to be positive for the mcr-1

gene in our trials. It suggested that the average positive
rate of mcr-1 is around 30% in these pig-producing
places. Also, 15 representative mcr-1-positive clinical
isolates were applied for further functional tests using the
LBA plates supplemented with colistin at various levels.
Consistent with our recent observation with the human
clinical isolates that produce MCR-1 [9], they consistently
exhibited the appreciable level of colistin resistance in that
the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is up to 32
mg/L (not shown).

Diversity in the mcr-1-harbouring plasmids
Given the fact the mcr-1 gene can be surrounded
with different genetic environment of diversified plasmid
backbones in the case of human clinical E. coli isolates
[9], we hypothesized that similar scenario could already
be present in the animal isolates in the healthy swine

populations (Figure 2). To address this hypothesis,
hundreds of mcr-1-carrying E. coli isolates were subjected
to extensive analyses using the multiplex-PCR assays
coupled with Sanger sequencing (Figure 3). In terms of
the paradigm mcr-1-harbouring plasmid pHNSHP45 with

known genome sequence, seven pairs of specific primers
(Table 2) that target seven interested genes (including mcr1 and nikB) were used in PCR assays to determine the
various mcr-1-surrounding genetic environment (Figures
2 and 3). In addition to the mcr-1 gene (Figure 3C), the

of the mcr-1-harbouring plasmids. The plasmid pHNSHP45 is a prototype with known genome sequence [8], whereas the other eight types
of plasmids are revealed after PCR-based sequencing of the 89 representative mcr-1-containing plasmids collected from three pig farms in
Guangdong province of China, in 2016. Arrows denote the known (and/or putative) genes/loci. The mcr-1 gene is highlighted in red and
100% identical. The broken arrow marked in grey background denotes the partial sequence of tnpA gene at its 3’-end. The tnpA locus is
PCR-negative in type 1 and 3. The green dot represents the IRR2 site. Apart from the type 1 and 2, all the other six types (3-8) are PCRpositive for the four genes (nikB, pilP, virD4 and virB4), as well as a hypothetical protein (hp), adjacent to the 3’-end of mcr-1. Unlike the
other types with an intact tnpA adjacent to the 5’-end of mcr-1, types 6, 7 and 8 feature with the truncated versions of tnpA. In type 1 like
pE15015 we recently reported, only the mcr-1 locus is PCR-positive. In type 2, two more loci (nikB and tnpA) can be detected in the PCR
assays. In particular, an extra-insert IS1 transposase with 97% identity to the counterpart of Acinetobacter baumannii by BlastX (illustrated
with a dark arrow) is closely present at the 3-end of hp in the type 5 of plasmid. In addition to the two known types (1 and 4) we reported
very recently [9], we show six new plasmid types (2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 labeled in red) in this study. B. Molecular insights into truncated

The integrated evidence accumulated here
allowed us to temporarily divide them into eight groups
(numbered with 1, 2, 3, … , 8) (Figure 2A). Type 1
plasmid is featuring with only PCR-positive for the mcr-1

remaining six genes corresponded to nikB (Figure 3A),
tnpA (Figure 3B), hp (Figure 3D), pilP (Figure 3E), virD4
(Figure 3F), and virB4 (Figure 3G), respectively. The result
of PCR assays coupled with Sanger sequencing revealed

gene (Figures 2A and 3C). Besides the mcr-1 gene, two
more genes with expected size (nikB (Figure 3A) and
tnpA (Figure 3B) are PCR-positive in Type 2 (Figure
2A). Unlike the type 4 plasmid whose PCR amplicons
are identical to those of the paradigm mcr-1-containing
plasmid pHNSHP45 (Figures 3A-3G) [8], Type 3 plasmid
lacks the tnpA gene in front of the mcr-1 locus (Figures 2A
and 3B). In relative to the type 3 plasmid, Type 5 plasmid
unexpectedly has a longer version of hp locus (Figure 3D)
that was subsequently found to encode an extra-insert
sequence (IS1) with 97% similarity to the counterpart in
Acinetobacter baumannii (Figure 2A). In the following
three types of plasmids (Types 6, 7 and 8), the tnpA loci
exhibited with PCR amplicons of various lengths (Figure
3B).

(IRR, “TCGTTGCACTTGGTTTGACAATTCAAG”)
remains 195 bp ahead of the mcr-1 gene in Type 6
plasmid (Figure 2B); ii) the full sequence of ISApl1 is
lost in the type 7 & 8 plasmids, remaining different relics
with various DNA fragment left upstream of the mcr-1
locus (189 bp for Type 7, and 60 bp for Type 8) (Figure
2B); iii) the site of IRR2 (Figure 2B) is consistently
present in the inter-genic region between hp-1 and
hp-2 (Figure 2C). IRR2 of GD52 other than GD764,
GD815, and GD990 is identical to that pHNSHP45
(TTTTTAAGAAGGGTGAACAAGTTCAAG).
Intriguingly,
the
IRR2
(TTTTTTAAGAAGGGTGAACAAXXXXXG) of pA3112 [25] was seen in ten strains/plasmids like GD28, GD75,
GD97, etc. (Figure 2C).
Extensive analysis of 89 mcr-1-containing sequences
suggested that 80% of plasmids belonged to Type 1, and
the plasmid of Type 6/7/8 (15% in total) is next to Type
1 (Figure 3H). Unlike the plasmids of the prevalent type
1, the plasmids of Type 2 (or 3) are pretty rare (1-2%,
Figure 3H). Given the fact that only Type 1 and 3 plasmids
have ever been observed in our earlier investigation [9, 12,
13], our findings here extended significantly the proposal
that the mcr-1 gene is carried by plasmids with diversified
genetic environments.

Variation in inverted repeat right (IRR)
Generally, the ISApl1 insertion sequence is detected
upstream of mcr-1 by recognizing its own IRL (terminal
inverted repeat left) and the closest downstream sequence
that resembled its IRR (terminal inverted repeat right)
(Figure 2B). The IRR2 seemed a flexible/imperfect
IRR-like sequence (Figure 2C) [25]. Further genetic
dissection defined that i) the terminal inverted repeat right

of the translation initiation site “ATG” (Figure 4A), which
is 1 bp upstream in comparison with the transcription
start site “A’ revealed by Poirel et al. [28] with 5’-RACE.
The minor difference might be due to mapping of the
truncated version of mcr-1 transcript by 5’-RACE. To
evaluate the promoter activity of the mcr-1 gene, the mcr1 promoter regions (303 bp) of the two plasmids (pA31-12
and pGD97) were fused to the promoter-less lacZ gene,
giving Pmcr-1-lacZ transcriptional fusions. Subsequent
LacZ analyses showed that β-gal activity driven by the
mcr-1 promoters of both pGD97 and pA31-12 is ~400
miller units (Figure 4B). It suggested that both pGD97 and
pA31-12 has a mcr-1 promoter with comparable medium
strength. Intriguingly, this speculation was proved by the
fact the two mcr-1-positive strains (GD97 and A31-12)
exhibited a similar level of colistin resistance to colistin
(~16 mg/L) (Figure 4C). Given the fact that colistin
resistance by the arabinose-induced expression of MCR1 is similar to that of GD97 and A31-12, we therefore
concluded that mcr-1 promoter is comparable to the
arabinose-inducible promoter of pBAD24.

To test the genetic heterogeneity amongst the
mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates, we thus performed the
analyses of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) using
15 representative E. coli isolates [23]. The MLST-based
sequence typing showed that they comprise 10 different
sequence types (STs) including ST98, ST10, ST20, ST218,
ST165, ST641, ST93, ST1286, ST4656, ST3546, and a
novel ST (n = 2) (Table 3). The novel ST (allelic profile:
10-11-5-10-8-236-2) is assigned to two E. coli isolates
GD97 and GD676. Most of the STs we determined,
were not previously related to the mcr-1 gene. But the
ST10 E. coli in Belgium was ever found to carry ESBLproducing plasmids and associated with human infection
[27]. By contrast, we recently observed co-production
of MCR-1 and ESBL in the epidemic strain of ST648 E.
coli [23]. Obviously, the mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates
from the swine populations exhibited appreciably genetic
heterogeneity in terms of diversified STs (Table 3).

CONCLUSIONS

The mcr-1 promoter

Colistin is a last defense against lethal infections by
Gram-negative pathogens with multiple drug resistance.
The MCR-1 mediates the transferable resistance to colistin,
raising an old, but newly-emerging threat to public health
[10]. In the past six months since the first discovery of
the mcr-1 colistin resistance gene in Southern China [8],
the literatures regarding to the mcr-1/colistin resistance
are increasingly-accumulated (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/pubmed/?term = mcr+1+colistin). Among them,

The mcr-1 promoter regions from the two plasmids
(pA31-12 and pGD97) were compared using multiple
sequence alignment, indicating that it is not less conserved
at 5’-end than that at 3’-end (Figure 4A). Prokaryotic
promoter analysis by the Neutral Network Program of
Promoter Prediction (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/
promoter.html) suggested that the transcription start site
of the mcr-1 gene is C at the position of 36 bp upstream

of the mcr-1 transmission/dissemination. In particular,
unexpected complexity in the multi-drug resistance was
assigned to the mcr-1-positive enteric bacteria [14, 23].

More seriously, the MCR-1 was found to co-localize with
two types of notorious drug resistant genes (ESBL [20, 23,
26] and NDM-1 (and/or its mutants) [29, 30]. We are first
to report the diversified mcr-1-harbouring plasmids from

Figure 4: The mcr-1 promoter activity determines the level of the E. coli resistance to colistin. A. Bioinformatics analyses

of the mcr-1 promoter. The putative mcr-1 promoter sequences were derived from the two Guangdong’s mcr-1-positive plasmids (pA31-12
[25] and pGD97, a representative of plasmids we report here). The nucleotide sequences were aligned with ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html), and the resultant output was generated with ESPript 2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.
cgi) [34, 35]. Identical residues are white letters with red background, similar residues are black letters, and gaps are denoted with dots.
Designations: S, transcription start site; M, methionine and translation initiation site; RBS, ribosome binding site. B. Measurement of β-gal
activity driven by the mcr-1 promoter. To measure bacterial β-gal activity, mid-log phase cultures of E. coli MC1061 with the Pmcr-1-lacZ
transcriptional fusion on chromosome were collected by spinning and suspended in Z-buffer [36]. The data was recorded in triplicate in
three independent experiments. The two strains used here include FYJ853 (Pmcr-1_pA31-12-lacZ for the mcr-1 promoter of A31-12 strain)
and FYJ 851 (Pmcr-1_pGD97-lacZ for the mcr-1 promoter of GD97 strain). Note: the mcr-1 promoter sequences (~300 bp region upstream
the transcription start site C) are identical. C. Visualization of the colistin resistance of E. coli conferred by the mcr-1-harbouring plasmids.
The E. coli strain MG1655 with/without the pBAD24 vector acts as the negative control, whereas the MG1655 with the arabinose-driven
MCR-1 expression refers to the positive control. The remaining two (A31-12 and GD97) are clinical mcr-1-positive isolates (highlighted in
red). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the colistin was determined with the method of plating in series of dilution. Briefly,
the mid-log phase cultures (OD600 = 0.8) in serial dilution were spotted on LBA plates with different level of colistin (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0,
8.0, 16.0 and 32.0 mg/L) and 0.2% arabinose. The LBA plates were maintained overnight at 37oC.

clinical E. coli isolates of diarrhea patients in China [9].
The similar scenarios were also seen in the E. coli isolates
from the swine populations [12].
In this study, we screened over 1000 pieces of
E. coli samples (from Guangdong Province, China) for
the presence of the mcr-1 gene (Figure 1). It allowed us
to gain insights into genetic environment of the mcr-1bearing plasmids. In addition to the two known plasmid
types (types 1 and 3), we observed four more kinds of
plasmid types (Figure 2), suggesting the unprecedented
complexity in the mcr-1-carrying plasmids. Also, the
variation is present in the IRR2 motif. It is not surprise
for us to notice nearly 10 different sequence types can be
assigned to these mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates. To the
best of our knowledge, it might represent an example
of complicated genetic diversity in both mcr-1-carrying
plasmids and E. coli hosts originating from the healthy
swine populations in China. Because that the IRR sites
are involved in the transposon-like transferable events of
the mcr-1 gene, the various versions of IRR2 might imply
difference/diversity among the MCR-1 transfer. Given the
fact that the high prevalence and complexity of the MCR1 colistin resistance in the healthy swine populations in
China, it is reasonable that enhanced surveillance efforts
is warranted to monitor and/or control the spread of the
mcr-1 resistance gene, esp. the possible dissemination of
food chain. Additionally, we are first to showe in vitro
evidence that the level of colistin resistance in various
clinical strains is determined by the promoter activity of
the mcr-1 gene (Figure 4B).
In summary, it seems likely that complex
dissemination of the diversified mcr-1-harbouring
plasmids occurs amongst the various ST E. coli inhabiting
the healthy swine populations, in Southern China. In
particular, our findings highlighted the urgent need to
reconsider the efficacy (safety) of colistin in the veterinary
use, and formulate a comprehensive strategy to fight
against the diversified plasmid-mediated mcr-1 colistin
resistance in pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

To address the genetic context surrounding the
mcr-1 gene, all of the mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates were
subjected to the multiplex-PCR with six pairs of specific
primers (Table 2) [9]. The resultant PCR products were
determined with Sanger sequencing. To probe the genetic
heterogeneity of the mcr-1-positive isolates, MLST was
carried out as we described [23]. Seven house-keeping
genes examined here correspond to adk, fumC, gyrB, icd,
mdh, purA and recA, respectively. The relevant seven pairs
of primers were available in the server of MLST ( http://
mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli) .

Plasmids and genetic manipulations
The mcr-1 promoters from the following plasmids
(pA31-12, pE15017 and pGD97) were amplified with
PCR and directly cloned into pAH125, giving the lacZ
transcriptional fusions, Pmcr-1-lacZ (Table 1). As we
described earlier [31], the resultant recombinant plasmids
like pAH-Pmcr-1(pA31-12), were transformed into
MC1061, and screened on Luria-Bertani Agar (LBA)
plates containing kanamycin and x-gal to give the
chromosomal mcr-1 transcriptional lacZ fusion strains like
FYJ853 (Table 1).

β-Galactosidase assays
The strains of E. coli carrying the chromosome
Pmcr-1-lacZ transcriptional fusion (e.g., FYJ853) were
grown in LB media, and mid-log phase cultures were
collected assayed for β-galactosidase activity following
lysis with SDS (sodium dodecylsulfate)-chloroform
[31, 32]. The data were recorded in triplicate from three
independent experiments.

Determination of the colistin resistance/tolerance

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Antibiotic susceptibility experiments were
conducted by the agar dilution method [33] recommended
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines (CLSI M100-S25). The EUCAST breakpoint
for Enterobacteriaceae was applied for colistin resistance
(European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing 2015). Here, strain FYJ795 refers to the positive
control, whereas the two strains (MG1655 and FYJ796)
are the negative controls. All strains including A31-12
and GD97 were collected in Mid-log-phase, then bacterial
cultures in a dilution series were spotted on LBA plates
supplemented with various levels of colistin (0, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, and 32.0 mg/liter) and maintained
at 37°C overnight. When necessary, 0.2% arabinose
was added into the LBA plates for induction of MCR-1

Bacterial isolations and identification
All the bacterial strains were E. coli derivatives
(Table 1). Fecal samples were routinely collected from
three different pig farms in Guangdong province, China,
in 2016. The nasal fluid and feces of pigs were sampled.
MacConkey solid agar plates were applied to isolate
the Enterobacterial species. The resultant bacteria were
subjected to colony PCR assays for the presence of the
mcr-1 gene (Table 2).
