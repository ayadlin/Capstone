ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) correlates with treatment failure and poor prognosis
among gastric cancer (GC) patients. In a previous study using high-throughput
functional screening, we identified 11 microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate MDR
in GC and found that miR-508-5p reversed MDR by targeting ABCB1 and ZNRD1.
However, the mechanism by which miR-508-5p was decreased in chemo-resistant
GC cells was unclear. In this study, we found that ectopic miR-27b is sufficient to
sensitize tumors to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, miR-27b directly
targets the 3′ untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of CCNG1, a well-known negative
regulator of P53 stability. Interestingly, miR-27b up-regulation leads to increased
miR-508-5p expression, and this phenomenon is mediated by CCNG1 and P53.
Further investigation indicated that miR-508-5p is directly regulated by P53. Thus,
the miR-27b/CCNG1/P53/miR-508-5p axis plays important roles in GC-associated
MDR. In addition, miR-27b and miR-508-5p expression was detected in GC tissues
with different chemo-sensitivities, and we found that tissues in which miR-27b and
miR-508-5p are up-regulated are more sensitive to chemotherapy. Together, these
data suggest that the combination of miR-27b and miR-508-5p represents a potential
marker of MDR. Restoring the miR-27b and miR-508-5p levels might contribute to
MDR reversion in future clinical practice.

For decades, researchers have explored how cancer
cells acquire chemo-resistance. According to the latest
studies, the expression of transporters is frequently
increased in chemo-resistant cancer cells, possibly
causing enhanced efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs [2–3].
Alternatively, cancer cells might antagonize the effect of
drugs by altering the structure or function of drug targets.
For example, the class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) isoform
is insensitive to paclitaxel. GC cells overexpressing
TUBB3 can survive paclitaxel exposure [4]. Reduced cell
death is a hallmark of chemo-resistant cancer cells that
can result from the suppression or mutation of several
tumor suppressors [5–6]. The abnormal expression and

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is the second leading cause of death
worldwide, and gastric cancer (GC) remains one of
the most common malignancies [1]. Chemotherapy is
recommended for patients with GC who have received
surgical treatment because it can prevent the recurrence
or metastasis of GC. However, some patients who receive
chemotherapy exhibit a poor initial response or gradually
develop resistance to the chemotherapy. This phenomenon,
known as multidrug resistance (MDR), might account for
most cases of treatment failure among patients with GC
[1–2].

function of apoptosis-associated molecules, including
Bax, Bcl-2 and caspases, can promote resistance to druginduced apoptosis [5]. Additionally, the inactivation or
mutation of P53, a well-known master tumor suppressor,
is associated with resistance to apoptosis [6]. Although a
wide range of MDR-associated molecules has been found,
the mechanisms underlying their functions and their
interactions are not fully understood.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding
RNAs that can trigger either translational repression
or mRNA degradation by targeting the 3′ untranslated
region (3′-UTR) of specific mRNAs [7]. In a previous
high-throughput functional screening study, we identified
a novel subset of 11 miRNAs that was associated with
MDR in GC [8]. Among these miRNAs, miR-508-5p
was found to play crucial roles in regulating MDR in
GC [8]. Subsequent analyses showed that each of these
11 miRNAs was associated with cellular sensitivity to at
least one chemotherapeutic drug. In light of this previous
research, we then examined why these 11 miRNAs, but
not other miRNAs, participate in MDR in GC cells. Do
these miRNAs interact or mutually regulate MDR in GC?
To examine these questions, we performed further
analyses and found that miR-27b, another member
of the subset of miRNAs that we newly identified, can
regulate chemo-resistance and miR-508-5p expression in
GC cells. Ectopic expression of miR-27b increases the
chemo-sensitivity of GC cells to several chemotherapeutic
drugs by inhibiting CCNG1. CCNG1 can regulate the
stability of P53, a master tumor suppressor that has
been shown to directly regulate miR-508-5p. We also
examined the expression levels of miR-27b and miR-5085p in GC specimens that differed in their sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic drugs and found that the levels of both
miR-27b and miR-508-5p were decreased in GC cases
with MDR. Moreover, the miR-27b and miR-508-5p
levels were evaluated in GC tissues collected from patients
at different survival durations and were shown to correlate
with the survival durations in patients with GC.

the chemo-resistance of GC, mimics of miR-27b were
transiently transfected into SGC7901/VCR cells, and
an inhibitor of miR-27b was transfected into SGC7901
cells (Figure 1B). Increased IC50 values of the anticancer
drugs adriamycin (ADR), VCR, 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and
cis-platinum (CDDP) were observed after miR-27b was
suppressed using inhibitors in SGC7901 cells (Figure 1C).
The overexpression of miR-27b markedly sensitized cells
to chemotherapy, as indicated by a decrease in the IC50
values of ADR, VCR, 5FU and CDDP (Figure 1C). To
examine whether miR-27b regulates the drug sensitivity
of GC cells in vivo, we transplanted SGC7901/VCR cells
into nude mice. These mice were divided into 2 groups,
which were treated with either agomir, which increased
miR-27b expression, or control oligonucleotides. The
mice that were treated with agomir exhibited markedly
decreased tumor volumes after chemotherapy, indicating
that drug resistance was reversed by ectopic miR-27b
expression (Figure 1D).
As discussed previously, the inhibition of apoptosis
is a major cause of drug resistance. Therefore, we
examined whether miR-27b influences the apoptosis
of GC cells. We observed that miR-27b promotes 5FUinduced apoptosis in SGC7901/VCR cells (Figure 1E).
Conversely, reducing miR-27b expression decreased the
apoptosis rate (Figure 1E). To further clarify how miR27b affects apoptosis, we examined the caspase activity
and Bcl-2 expression levels and found that miR-27b
enhances the activity of caspase-3 and −9 and decreases
the expression of Bcl-2 (Figure 1F).

CCNG1 is a target gene of miR-27b
Using the bioinformatics algorithms TargetScan,
miRanda, miRDB and CLIP-seq, we obtained a list of
candidate target genes of miR-27b. We were extremely
interested in 6 genes that were identified by all 4 prediction
algorithms: CCNG1, GOLM1, NAA15, NCOA7,
RPS6KA5 and TGOLN2 (Figure 2A). As demonstrated
above, miR-27b can regulate apoptosis. Therefore, we
focused on CCNG1, which is involved in apoptosisassociated pathways, as suggested by GO analysis.
Multidrug-resistant GC cells that express miR-27b
exhibit significant attenuation of CCNG1 expression at
both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2B and 2D),
whereas the inhibition of miR-27b increases CCNG1
expression (Figure 2B and 2D). Similar results were
observed from tumors in mice treated with miR-27b
(Supplementary Figure S1).
To assess whether CCNG1 is a direct target of
miR-27b, luciferase activity assays were performed using
luciferase reporters carrying the 3′-UTRs of CCNG1
(Figure 2C). In SGC7901/VCR cells that were stably
transfected with the lenti-miR-27b vector or a control
vector, luciferase activity was dramatically decreased. This
suppression was reversed by the mutation of binding site 1
or of binding site 2 in the 3′-UTRs of CCNG1 (Figure 2C).

RESULTS
miR-27b regulates the chemo-sensitivity and
apoptosis of GC cells
Previously, we identified a novel subset of 11
miRNAs that were implicated in MDR in GC. Among
these candidate miRNAs, miR-27b was shown to
reverse vincristine (VCR) resistance and was expressed
at significantly lower levels in chemo-resistant GC cells
[8]. In this study, we assessed the expression level of
miR-27b in 30 paired GC and adjacent normal tissues
using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR; qRT-PCR). As expected,
miR-27b was significantly down-regulated in GC tissues
(Figure 1A). To fully address the effects of miR-27b on

It is well known that miRNAs can induce the degradation
of target genes, and we detected a correlation between
miR-27b and CCNG1 expression. As shown in Figure 2E,
the expression level of miR-27b inversely correlated with
the quantity of CCNG1 mRNA.

UTR binding sites, but not full-length CCNG1, increased
the expression of CCNG1 in cells and antagonized the
effects of miR-27b (Figure 3E). Additionally, we cotransfected siRNAs targeting CCNG1 and the inhibitor
of miR-27b into SGC7901 cells. We found that the effect
of the miR-27b inhibitor was attenuated by the CCNG1
siRNAs (Figure 3F). These results confirmed that miR-27b
regulates MDR by targeting CCNG1.

miR-27b regulates the chemo-resistance and
apoptosis of GC cells via CCNG1

P53 stability is promoted by miR-27b-mediated
CCNG1 expression, and P53 acts as a direct
modulator of miR-508-5p expression

We examined the role of CCNG1 in drug resistance
in GC. To this end, 3 pairs of siRNAs specific for
CCNG1 were synthesized, and their inhibitory effects on
CCNG1 were confirmed by western blotting (Figure 3A).
Remarkably, silencing CCNG1 decreased the IC50 values
of ADR, VCR, 5FU and CDDP and markedly increased
the apoptosis rates when the resistant cells were treated
with 5FU (Figure 3B and 3C). Knockdown of CCNG1
increased the activities of caspase-3 and −9 but suppressed
Bcl-2 expression in chemo-resistant GC cells (Figure 3D).
To further confirm the role of CCNG1, we cotransfected miR-27b mimics and plasmids carrying fulllength CCNG1 containing or lacking a 3′-UTR binding
sites into SGC7901/VCR cells. CCNG1 lacking a 3′-

We previously found that miR-508-5p can regulate
MDR in GC [8]. We were particularly interested in
determining whether miR-508-5p is involved in miR-27b
function. Interestingly, we found that silencing miR-27b
decreases the expression of miR-508-5p in SGC7901 cells
but that up-regulating miR-27b dramatically increases
miR-508-5p expression (Figure 4A). Alternatively, the
expression level of miR-27b remains stable regardless of the
up- or down-regulation of miR-508-5p (Figure 4A). This
result suggests that miR-27b might serve as an upstream

modulator of miR-508-5p. To confirm whether miR-27b
regulates miR-508-5p via CCNG1, we co-transfected the
CCNG1-ß3′-UTR or CCNG1-wt plasmid and a miR-27b
mimic into SGC7901/VCR cells. Exogenous CCNG1
decreased the levels of miR-508-5p induced by miR-27b
(Figure 4A). Moreover, RNA interference with CCNG1
siRNA ameliorated the miR-27b-induced reduction in the
miR-508-5p levels (Figure 4A).
CCNG1 is reportedly a negative regulator of P53
[9]. We found that either ectopic miR-27b expression or
CCNG1 knockdown increased P53 expression, whereas
treatment with a miR-27b inhibitor or exogenous
CCNG1 reduced P53 expression (Figure 4B). To confirm
whether P53 directly regulates miR-508-5p, 3 pairs of
siRNAs specific for P53 were synthesized, and siRNA1
and siRNA2 were found to effectively suppress P53
(Figure 4C). We observed that P53 siRNA transfection
dramatically decreased the miR-508-5p levels but that

transfection with a plasmid containing full-length P53
increased the miR-508-5p levels in SGC7901/VCR cells
(Figure 4C).
To further elucidate the potential effects of P53 on
miR-508-5p, we examined the expression levels of P53 in
several GC cell lines. As shown in Figure 4D, abundant
P53 expression was detected in MKN45, SGC7901 and
BGC823 cells, but no P53 expression was observed in
MKN28 or KATO3 cells. Next, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using MKN45,
SGC7901, BGC823 and MKN28 cells. Interestingly,
P53 directly bound to the promoter region of miR-5085p in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells but not in BGC823 or
MKN28 cells (Figure 4D). We constructed a wild-type
P53 plasmid and directly cloned P53 from SGC7901
and BGC823 cells. These different forms of P53 were
separately transfected into MKN28 cells, which lacked
P53 expression, as described above. All P53 isoforms were

detected in MKN28 cells after transfection (Figure 4D),
and subsequent ChIP assays showed that both wild-type
P53 and P53 cloned from SGC7901 cells transactivated
miR-508-5p, leading to increased miR-508-5p (Figure 4D
and 4E). These results are consistent with those found for
endogenous P53 proteins.
Actually, mutations of TP53 occur frequently in
cancer and we assumed that the sequences of TP53 might
be associated with its transcriptional activities. We then
performed DNA sequencing and found out the TP53
mutations in these cell lines. SGC7901 and SGC7901/
VCR cells harbored the same mutations, including 140C
> G in exon2, 119C > G in exon3 and 59G > A in exon4.
For BGC823 cell line, it contained the same mutations
as SGC7901 and SGC7901/VCR cells, and what made it
different is that BGC823 cells also harbor 1 more mutation:
68C > T in exon2. Combined with the binding activities
of P53 to miR-508-5p promoter from different cells, we
speculated that the accumulation of more mutations might
influence the core conformations that function in its binding
activities, which prevented P53 from binding to the promoter
of miR-508-5p.

GC cases displaying different chemo-sensitivities. We
first collected GC tissues from 47 patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgical treatment in
our hospital between 2010 and 2012. The response to
chemotherapy was evaluated according to the mRECIST
criteria, and patients who were evaluated as “CR” or “PR”
were regarded as sensitive to chemotherapy. Based on
in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining
analyses, we found that miR-27b expression inversely
correlated with CCNG1 expression in GC tissues (Figure
5A, Table 1). In addition, the levels of both miR-27b
and miR-508-5p correlated with the drug responses of
the GC cases. GC tissues that contained higher levels of
miR-27b and miR-508-5p tended to be more sensitive to
chemotherapy (Table 2). The data analysis also showed
that the miR-27b and miR-508-5p expression levels were
positively correlated (Table 3).
Via in-situ hybridization assays, we detected
the expression of both miR-27b and miR-508-5p in
tissue microarrays representing 114 GC patients whose
survival durations had been recorded. The GC cases
were divided into sub-groups according to the intensities
of miR-27b and miR-508-5p expression (Figure 5B,
Supplementary Table S1), and their association with the
overall survival duration was analyzed using KaplanMeier curves. Patients who expressed either miR-27b or
miR-508-5p at high levels were more likely to survive
than those who expressed lower miR-27b or miR508-5p levels (Figure 5C and 5D). We then analyzed
miR-27b and miR-508-5p together in our analyses and

DISCUSSION

found that patients displaying different miR-27b and
miR-508-p expression levels exhibited distinct survival
characteristics. The overall survival duration of the GC
patients simultaneously displaying elevated miR-27b
and miR-508-5p levels was significantly longer than
that of the remaining GC patients (Figure 5E and 5F).
Taken together, these data suggest that the combination
of miR-27b and miR-508-5p represents a potential
marker of the chemotherapy response and the survival
duration of patients with GC.

Based on high-throughput profiling analysis, several
subsets of miRNAs were suggested to be associated
with drug-resistant GC [10–13], and several miRNAs
were found to regulate the drug resistance of GC
[10–13]. However, little research has explored whether
the miRNAs that were identified by these screens are
mutually associated. In a previous study, we found that the
overexpression of a novel subset of 11 miRNAs, including

miR-27b, reversed the MDR of GC [8]. In the present
study, miR-27b was shown to participate in sensitizing GC
cells to several chemotherapeutic agents. We found that
the effect of miR-27b is similar to that of miR-508-5p, a
miRNA that exhibits a great capacity to reverse MDR, as
reported in our previous study [8]. Thus, we explored the
potential association between miR-27b and miR-508-5p.
Interestingly, we found that ectopic miR-27b expression
leads to increased miR-508-5p expression, whereas miR27b knockdown subsequently decreases miR-508-5p
expression. These data suggest that miR-508-5p might
partially contribute to the effects of miR-27b on MDR in
GC.
CCNG1 is a direct target gene of miR-27b, and
a loss of function study showed that the pro-apoptotic
effect of miR-27b is mediated by CCNG1. CCNG1 has

been identified as a homolog of c-Src kinase and has
been characterized as a direct transcriptional target of
P53 [9]. CCNG1 was reported to function as a suppressor
of tumor proliferation in breast and lung cancer [14–15].
Several studies showed that CCNG1 plays important roles
in liver cancer. CCNG1 expands liver tumor-initiating
cells by inducing Sox2 via Akt/mTOR signaling, and
CCNG1 was identified as a classical target of miR-122,
a liver-specific miRNA [16–18]. miR-122 was found to
sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to ADR
and VCR by inducing cell cycle arrest, and this effect
was associated with CCNG1 [17]. Further investigation
showed that the miR-122/CCNG1 interaction influences
p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity and
reduces the invasiveness of HCC-derived cell lines [18].
Interestingly, several studies have shown that CCNG1

regulates the stability and activity of P53. For example,
CCNG-deficient cells exhibit lower dephosphorylated
Mdm2 levels and higher P53 protein levels than
CCNG1+/+ cells [19–20]. Furthermore, it was observed
that CCNG1-mediated P53 stabilization is dependent on
Mdm2 [21]. These data strongly suggest that CCNG1
serves as a negative regulator of the P53 pathway. Indeed,
we observed increased P53 expression after CCNG1
silencing, thus explaining why miR-508-5p expression
increases following ectopic miR-27b expression.
In our previous study, we performed functional
screening for MDR-associated miRNAs in GC. It was
showed that miR-27b did not confer significant effects
on cell proliferation [8]. To further confirm this, we also
performed MTT assays in SGC7901 and SGC7901/
VCR cells when miR-27b was down- or up-regulated
(Supplementary Figure S2). The results showed that there
was no significant effect of miR-27b on cell proliferation in
GC. Similarly, the role of CCNG1 in cell proliferation was
also studied and we found that knockdown of CCNG1 in
SGC7901/VCR cells slightly suppressed cell proliferation
(Supplementary Figure S2). One possible explanation to
the inconsistent effects of miR-27b and CCNG1 on cell
proliferation is that CCNG1 was not the only target gene
for miR-27b. Therefore, the effects of CCNG1 might be
attenuated by other genes targeted by miR-27b.
It has been widely suggested that P53, a master
tumor suppressor protein, transactivates miRNAs but is
regulated by other miRNAs [22]. In drug-resistant GC
cells, P53 is suppressed by increased CCNG1 levels
resulting from the down-regulation of miR-27b, and
loss of P53 directly suppresses miR-508-5p. In addition,
either increasing or decreasing P53 expression directly
influences the expression of miR-508-5p. However, this
transactivation apparently differs among P53 proteins from
different cell lines. We demonstrated that endogenous or
exogenous wild-type P53 regulates miR-508-5p. However,
the P53 proteins from SGC7901 and BGC823 cells
exhibit distinct binding activities to the promoter region
of miR-508-5p. P53 from SGC7901 cells maintained the
transactivation of miR-508-5p, whereas the P53 protein
from BGC823 cells did not regulate miR-508-5p. Recent
studies indicated that mutations were frequently observed
in different GC cells and tissues [23–24]. It has been
reported that mutations of P53 can suppress the function
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of wild-type P53 and even reverse its tumor-suppressive
property [25]. The exact reasons why P53 proteins
containing different mutations differentially regulate miR508-5p remain unclear. We speculate that these different
mutations might cause distinct changes to the functional
domains of P53; however, further studies are needed to
clarify these issues.
It has been suggested that miR-27b is associated
with cell proliferation and invasion and with angiogenesis
in several types of cancer; however, its function in
regulating MDR remains ambiguous [26–28]. Indeed,
miR-27b is reportedly up-regulated in drug-resistant subclones of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, although
it was not determined whether these changes in miR-27b
expression directly affected the chemo-sensitivity of
HCC cells [29]. However, in a recent study, miR-27b
was found to be down-regulated in HCC and to affect the
sensitivities of HCC cells to several therapeutic agents
via p53 activation and CYP1B1 suppression [30]. The
observations in this study are similar to those found in
GC, suggesting that the antagonizing effect of miR-27b on
MDR in cancer might depend on the P53 status. Patients
carrying wild-type P53 or P53 with restricted mutations
are more likely to benefit from miR-27b-targeted MDR
intervention.
One of the most important aims of our study was to
evaluate the potential diagnostic significance of miR-27b and
miR-508-5p in GC tissues. Based on an examination of miR27b and miR-508-5p expression in GC patients exhibiting
definite drug responses, we found a direct association
between miRNA expression and chemo-sensitivity. Patients
with high sensitivity to chemotherapy exhibited higher
expression levels of miR-27b or miR-508-5p. In addition,
survival analysis of 114 patients with GC indicated that the
levels of both miR-27b and miR-508-5p correlated with an
extended survival duration among patients with GC. Using
the combination of miR-27b and miR-508-5p might better
distinguish GC patients according to their survival duration.
Several miRNAs are reportedly associated with drug
resistance in GC, and an attempt has been made to elucidate
the miRNA signature of GC tissues following chemotherapy
[10, 11, 13]. Upon the further validation of the role of these
miRNAs in GC, additional study is warranted to establish a
multivariate model for predicting MDR based on a panel of
candidate miRNAs.

In conclusion, miR-27b is a novel miRNA
that regulates MDR in GC. By targeting CCNG1,
overexpressed miR-27b promotes drug-induced apoptosis
and reverses GC-related MDR in vitro and in vivo.
In addition, miR-27b stimulates the up-regulation of
miR-508-5p by P53, and this effect is dependent on the
negative regulation of P53 by CCNG1. The novel miR27b/CCNG1/P53/miR-508-5p axis characterized here
provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying drug
resistance. The restoration of miR-27b and miR-508-5p
expression represents a potential therapeutic strategy for
the future treatment of GC patients with MDR.

In vitro drug sensitivity assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apoptosis assay

Cell culture and tissue collection

Cell apoptosis was evaluated using an Annexin-VFITC apoptosis detection kit (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) as previously described [8].

A miR-27b inhibitor was transfected into SGC7901
cells, and miR-27b mimics were transfected into
SGC/7901VCR cells. Drug sensitivity was assessed
as described previously [8]. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were
seeded in 96-well plates, and medium containing
chemotherapeutic drugs was added to each well. After
incubation for 48 h, a 3-(4,5-di-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) assay was performed. Inhibition rates and IC50
values were then calculated.

The human GC cell line SGC7901 and its multidrugresistant variant SGC7901/VCR (which was established by
our laboratory) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
(Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) that was supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100
U/ml penicillin sodium and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate
at 37°C under a humidified air atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. Paired samples of primary GC and adjacent normal
tissues were obtained from patients who had undergone
surgery for GC resection at Xijing Hospital, Xi’an, China.
This study was approved by the Protection of Human
Subjects Committee of our hospital, and informed consent
was obtained from each patient.

Luciferase assay
Plasmids carrying wild-type Luc-CCNG1 or mutant
Luc-CCNG1-ß3′-UTR were synthesized (GeneCopoeia,
Rockville, MD, USA). The luciferase assay was performed
as previously described [8].

Western blotting
Cells or tissues were solubilized in RIPA buffer
(Beyotime, China) containing protease inhibitors (Roche,
Switzerland), and western blotting was performed as
previously described [8]. Primary antibodies against P53
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), CCNG1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and β-actin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used.

RNA extraction and real-time qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using
RNA extraction reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan).
To detect the expression of miR-27b, stem-loop RT-PCR
was performed using an All-in-One™ miRNA qRT-PCR
Detection Kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for
miR-27b and U6 were purchased from GeneCopoeia.
qRT-PCR was performed to detect CCNG1 mRNA
using the SYBR Green PCR Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu,
Japan). The mRNA level of CCNG1 was normalized to
the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
levels.

Tissue microarray, in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemical analyses
Tissue microarray of formalin-fixed 114 GC cases
(Aomei Biotechnology CoLtd, Xi’an, China) was obtained
and the clinicopathologic data for each case was provided
by the manufacturer. Probes (miR-27b and miR-508-5p)
for in situ hybridization were purchased from Exiqon
(miRCURY LNA detection probes, 5′-digoxigeninlabeled). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical
analyses were conducted as previously described [8]. All
sections were examined and scored independently by
two investigators in a double-blinded manner. Staining
intensity was determined according to a histological
scoring method. The proportion of positive cells in each
specimen was quantitatively evaluated and scored as
follows: 0 for staining in 0% of the cells examined, 1
for 0.01–25%, 2 for 25.01–50%, 3 for 50.01–75%, and 4
for > 75%. The staining intensity was graded as follows:
0, no signal; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong. The
histological score of the miRNAs for each section was

Oligonucleotide construction and transfection
Mimics and inhibitors of miRNA, agomirs and
negative control oligonucleotides for hsa-miR-27b were
obtained from RiboBio Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, Guangdong,
China). siRNAs and plasmids for CCNG1 and TP53 were
purchased from Genechem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Target cells were transfected with oligonucleotides using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

computed using the following formula: histological score
= proportion score × intensity score. A total score of 0–12
was calculated and graded as follows: negative (−, score:
0), weak (+, score: 1–4), moderate (++, score: 5–8) or
strong (+++, score: 9–12). Scores of “ − ” and “+” were
considered as low expression, whereas scores of “++” and
“+++” were considered as high expression.

In vivo drug sensitivity assay
Approximately 1.0 × 107 SGC7901/VCR cells were
subcutaneously injected into the right flank of nude mice.
Mice harboring tumors were injected with the agomir or
the control for miR-27b. Two weeks later, the mice were
intraperitoneally injected with PBS containing VCR, 85FU8
or CDDP once weekly. The tumor volume was measured
using a Vernier caliper on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and was
calculated as follows: volume = length × width2. The mice
were humanely killed on day 28; then, the tumors were
photographed. The expression levels of miR-27b and
CCNG1 were analyzed using western blotting and qRT-PCR.
