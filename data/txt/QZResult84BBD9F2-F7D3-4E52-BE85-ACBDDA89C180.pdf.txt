ABSTRACT
While chemotherapy remains to be one of the main approaches in the clinical
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multidrug resistance (MDR) has become
a serious problem which limits the therapeutic efficacy. The important roles of the
PI3K/Akt pathway in modulating cell proliferation and MDR suggest that PI3K inhibitor
might be effective for treatment of AML. In the present study, the antiproliferative
effects of PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 on AML cell HL60 and the adriamycin (ADR)-resistant
HL60/ADR cells were investigated. Our data indicated that ZSTK474 exhibited potent
antiproliferative activity, induced G1 cell cycle arrest, but no obvious apoptosis in both
cell lines. Moreover, ZSTK474 affected the protein levels of cell-cycle-related molecules
including increased p27, decreased cyclin D1 and phosphorylated Rb in dose-dependent
manner. The proteins downstream of PI3K including phosphorylated PDK1, Akt and
GSK-3β were reduced in a dose-dependent manner after ZSTK474 treatment. ZSTK474
reversed ADR resistance, increased the intracellular accumulation of ADR, and reduced
the expression and function of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins including both
P-gp and MRP1 in HL60/ADR cells. The combination of ZSTK474 and chemotherapeutic
drugs cytarabine or vincristine led to a synergistic effect in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells.
In conclusion, ZSTK474 showed potent antiproliferative effect on HL60 and HL60/
ADR cells; combination with cytarabine or vincristine resulted in synergistic effect.
Our results suggest ZSTK474 has the potential to be applied in the treatment of AML
patients, while further evidences particularly those about in vivo efficacy are needed.

chemotherapy [1–3]. MDR is characterized by decreased
intracellular drug accumulation after a period of drug
administration, which is mediated by increase of drug
efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MRP1 [4, 5]. Therefore, novel
anticancer drugs that are effective on multidrug resistant
AML are expected.

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a complex disease
characterized by abnormal differentiation and unlimited
cellular proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells. Current
clinical treatments such as chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation,
and stem cell transplantation are associated with incomplete
remission and side effects. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a
major obstacle to successfully treating AML patients with

3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates the downstream
Akt and thus regulates signaling pathways involved in cell
proliferation and the cell cycle [6]. Previous studies have
indicated that Akt activation can induce MDR in tumors
such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular
carcinomas, suggesting that PI3K/Akt pathway might be
involved in MDR developed during cancer chemotherapy
[7, 8]. ZSTK474, a specific PI3K inhibitor that we
previously identified by using the JFCR39 drug discovery
system [9, 10], exhibited potent antitumor activity against
various tumors [11, 12]. However, the effect of ZSTK474
on AML and MDR has not yet been reported.
Therefore, we recently investigated the vitro antitumor
activities of ZSTK474 toward AML as well as the ability to
reverse MDR. Moreover, we evaluated the synergistic effects
of ZSTK474 in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs.

chemotherapeutic drugs. As shown in Figure 1A, IC50
of ADR for HL60/ADR is 23.1 μM while that for HL60
is 0.415 μM. The relative resistance (RR) was therefore
calculated to be 55.6, confirming that the former cell
line indeed showed resistance to ADR [13]. We then
investigated the antiproliferative effects of ZSTK474
on both cell lines by using MTT assay. ZSTK474
inhibited proliferation of both HL60 and HL60/ADR
cells in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 as 1.165
μM and 1.160 μM (Figure 1B), respectively. Cell count
assay indicated similar result (Supplementary Figure
1). The similar antileukaemia potency of ZSTK474 on
HL60 and HL60/ADR cells suggested that ZSTK474
might not be a substrate of MRP1/ P-gp in HL60/ADR
cells.
Next, the colony formation assays were conducted
to further examine the effects of ZSTK474 on HL60 and
HL60/ADR proliferation. The cells were pre-treated with
0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 or 2 μM of ZSTK474 for 48 h and grown
in soft agar for 14 days. As indicated in Figure 2A and
2B, the number of the colonies formed by ZSTK474treated cells was reduced markedly compared with control
(without treatment), in either HL60 or the resistant HL60/
ADR cells.

ZSTK474 induced G1 cell cycle arrest, but did
not induce apoptosis in HL60 and HL60/ADR
cells

ZSTK474 affected the cell cycle-related
molecules in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells
Cell cycle progression is promoted by CDK (cyclindependent kinase)-cyclin complexes and negatively
regulated by CDK inhibitors such as p27. To investigate
the mechanism of G1 arrest by ZSTK474, we analyzed
the amounts of the proteins known to be involved
in G1/S progression, including cyclin D1, p27 and
downstream p-Rb. As shown in Figure 5A, the expression
of p27 increased, whereas the levels of cyclin D1 and
phosphorylated Rb decreased dose-dependently. The effect
of ZSTK474 on p27 mRNA expression was also examined
via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). Figure 5B shows that the RNA expression levels
of p27 in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells clearly enhanced
after ZSTK474 treatment. The results suggest that an
increase of p27 expression, as well as reduction of cyclin

Because cell cycle progression is necessary for cell
proliferation, we investigated the effect of ZSTK474 on
cell cycle of HL60 and HL60/ADR cells. The cells were
treated with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 or 2 µM of ZSTK474 for 48 h,
and analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide
(PI) staining. The results showed that ZSTK474 induced
G1 arrest in both HL60 and HL60/ADR cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 3A and 3B). On the other hand,
as shown in Figure 4A and 4B, the annexin V/PI staining
assay did not detect apparent apoptosis in ZSTK474treated HL60 or HL60/ADR cells, suggesting that the
antiproliferative activity of ZSTK474 might be unrelated
to apoptosis induction. Homoharringtonine (HHRT) was
used as a positive control.

D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation might be involved
in ZSTK474-induced G1 arrest. Since ZSTK474 is a
specific PI3K inhibitor, to correlate the G1 arrest effect
to its inhibition against PI3K/Akt pathway, we examined
the effects of ZSTK474 on the proteins downstream of
PI3K. Figure 5C shows that the levels of phosphorylated
PDK1, Akt and GSK-3β were reduced in a dose-dependent
manner after ZSTK474 treatment.

ZSTK474, respectively.

ZSTK474 increased the intracellular
accumulation of ADR
To investigate the mechanism of reversal effect
of ZSTK474 on resistance to ADR, we determined the
intracellular accumulation of ADR in HL60/ADR cells
with or without ZSTK474 treatment. As shown in Figure
6A, ZSTK474 increased intracellular accumulation
of ADR in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that
ZSTK474 reversed drug resistance by reducing ADR
efflux from HL60/ADR cells.

ZSTK474 reversed ADR resistance in HL60/
ADR cells
Since the antiproliferative potency of ZSTK474
on HL60/ADR cells is similar to that on the parent
HL60 cells, we then assessed whether ZSTK474 could
reverse the MDR resistance in HL60/ADR cells. We
first examined the resistance to ADR of the cells in the
presence of ZSTK474. As shown in Table 1 , ADR alone
displayed weak inhibition against proliferation of HL60/
ADR cells with IC50 as 23.1 μM. However, co-treatment
with ZSTK474 reduced the resistance to ADR in a dosedependent manner, with the reversal fold (RF) values to

ZSTK474 inhibited the expression and function
of MDR proteins
Then we analyzed the effect of ZSTK474 on MDR
proteins in HL60/ADR cells. As shown in Figure 6B, the
expression of both P-gp and MRP1 protein was decreased
in a dose-dependent manner after ZSTK474 treatment.

To confirm the effect on the functions of MDR proteins,
the intracellular accumulation of P-gp substrate Rh123
and MRP1 substrate 5-CFDA in HL60/ADR cells was
determined. As shown in Figure 6C, the accumulation
of both Rh123 and 5-CFDA was increased in a dosedependent manner, as compared with that in the cells
without ZSTK474 treatment, further supporting that
ZSTK474 might reverse drug resistance by negatively
affecting the expression and function of MDR proteins.

concentrations at this fixed ratio (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%
and 100% of the IC50value of each drug). Figure 7A–7C
shows that co-treatment with ZSTK474 led to greater
inhibition of cell proliferation than each chemotherapeutic
drug alone. Combination of ZSTK474 with cytarabine and
vincristine exhibited a synergistic effect at all of the tested
concentrations with CI<1 (Figure 7D–7E). However,
combination with homoharringtonine does not always
result in synergistic effect in either HL60 cells or HL60/
ADR cells (Figure 7F).

AML [14]. This pathway has key functions in regulating
cell growth, survival and cell cycle. Furthermore,
different groups have demonstrated that PI3K/Akt/mTOR
activation is an indicator of chemoresistance in AML
[15–17]. ZSTK474 is a specific class I PI3K inhibitor we
previously identified by using the JFCR39 drug discovery
system [10]. In the present study, we investigated for the
first time the efficacy of ZSTK474 on AML. ZSTK474
inhibited the proliferation of HL60 and HL60/ADR cells
with IC50 value of 1.165 μM and 1.160 μM, respectively.
Cell count assay and colony formation assay demonstrated
that ZSTK474 potently inhibited the proliferation and
tumorigenicity of HL60 and HL60/ADR cells.
Flowcytometric analysis with PI staining indicated
that ZSTK474 induced G1 arrest in both HL60 and
HL60/ADR cells. Cell cycle progression is known to
be promoted by cyclin-CDK complexes and inhibited
by CDK inhibitor proteins such as p27. Treatment with
ZSTK474 increased p27 level but decreased cyclin D1
and p-Rb levels. GSK-3β (a downstream effector of Akt)
has been reported to increase cyclin D1 expression [18],
and Akt is known to upregulate p27 [19]. Phosphorylation
of Akt and GSK-3β was inhibited by ZSTK474, thus
supporting the notion that blocking PI3K/Akt signaling
might be involved in G1 arrest. On the other hand, our
results revealed that treatment with ZSTK474 for 48 h
only induced slight apoptosis in HL60 and HL60/ADR
cells, suggesting that ZSTK474 exhibits antitumor effects
mainly via G1 arrest but not apoptosis which is consistent
with the results reported previously [20, 21].
Emergence of MDR is the greatest obstacle to
successful implementation of chemotherapy in cancer
patients. In recent years, the relationship between ABC
transporter expression and PI3K/Akt pathway has
received much attention [8, 22–24]. Particularly, it has
been reported that activation of PI3K/Akt pathway could
promote the transcription and expression of MRP1 and
MDR1 (the gene that encodes P-gp) genes, via affecting
downstream transcription factors Nrf2 (NF-E2-related
factor 2) and NF-κB, respectively [25, 26]. Our results
revealed that 2 μM of ZSTK474 strongly reversed
ADR resistance by over 30-fold. Meanwhile, ZSTK474
decreased P-gp and MRP1 protein expression in a dosedependent manner. And the function of P-gp and MRP1
as the MDR-relevant efflux pumps was also inhibited
by ZSTK474. At similar concentrations, ZSTK474
decreased the levels of Akt phosphorylation, suggesting
that blockade of PI3K/Akt pathway might contribute to
the resistance reversal activity of ZSTK474.
As common clinical antileukaemia drugs,
cytarabine, vincristine and homoharringtonine can
provide brief remission to patients with AML. However,
these highly toxic drugs can be offered to only a subset
of the patients [27, 28]. Since proper drug combination
often leads to higher efficacy than that of a single drug,
with a limited toxicity [29], we tested the antileukaemia
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity of each of the 3 chemotherapeutic drugs in
combination with ZSTK474. Our results showed that the
antiproliferative effect of either cytarabine or vincristine
on HL60 and HL60/ADR cell was obviously increased
when combined with ZSTK474, and these combinations
were synergistic. Combination of homoharringtonine
with ZSTK474 led to a better effect compared with that
with homoharringtonine alone, but the combination was
not synergistic, of which the mechanism remains to
be elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report for combination effect of PI3K inhibitors and
chemotherapeutic agents in AML cells.
In conclusion, ZSTK474 exhibited antileukaemia
activity by inducing G1 arrest, and reversed the acquired
drug resistance by inhibiting P-gp and MRP1 expression
via the PI3K/Akt pathway. A synergistic effect was
observed in the AML HL60 cell line as well as the
multidrug resistant HL60/ADR cell line when combined
with chemotherapeutic drugs cytarabine or vincristine.
Our findings suggest the potential application of ZSTK474
in AML therapy while in vivo evidences are still required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
ZSTK474, adriamycin (ADR), cytarabine,
vincristine and homoharringtonine were obtained from
Selleck (London, ON, Canada). MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide)
reagent was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH,
USA). Antibodies against phospho-PDK1 (Ser241), Akt,
phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9), β-actin,
as well as anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies, were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). A FITC Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit, antibodies against p-Rb (pS780),
cyclin D1 and p27 were purchased from BD Biosciences
(San Jose, CA, USA). Antibodies against P-gp, MRP1
and Lamin B were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Rhodamine123 (Rh123) and
5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (5-CFDA) were purchased

Cell culture
The human acute myeloid leukaemia HL60 cell line
was purchased from the Cell Resource Centre, Peking
Union Medical College (Beijing, China). HL60/ADR
was obtained from the Institute of Haematology, Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences (Tianjin, China). Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% kanamycin (100 μg/ml)
and 1% glutamine (0.44 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 incubator at
37°C. ADR (final concentration as 0.5 μg/ml) was added
to the medium to maintain the MDR phenotype in the

Determination of reversal fold values

HL60/ADR cells. The cells were further cultured in ADRfree medium for 2 weeks before experiments.

Determination of reversal fold values was performed
using MTT assay. Cell suspension was seeded in each well
of a 96-well plate and treated with various concentrations
of ADR in combination with ZSTK474 (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2
μM) for 48 h at 37 °C. The resulting absorbance at 490
nm was measured by using a microplate reader iMark as
described above.

Cell proliferation and colony formation assay
Assessment of cell proliferation was performed
using MTT assays, as described in our previous reports
[30, 31]. Briefly, 200 μl of cell suspension (2×104 cells/
ml) was seeded in each well of a 96-well plate and treated
with various concentrations of ZSTK474 for 48 h at 37°C.
After the addition of MTT, the cells were incubated for an
additional 4 h. Then, the culture medium was removed,
and the purple formazan crystals were dissolved DMSO.
The resulting absorbance at 490 nm was measured by
using a microplate reader iMark (BIO-RAD, Hercules,
CA, USA).
For the colony formation assay, pre-treated cells
were resuspended in 2 ml of agarose solution (0.4%) in
complete medium as the upper agar layer and seeded into
60 mm dishes in which the bottom agar layer comprised
of 2 ml of complete medium and agarose solution (0.8%)
had already solidified. After incubation for 14 days, the
colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained
with 0.5% crystal violet, and the number of colonies was
counted. The experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated three times.

Determination of intracellular accumulation of
ADR
HL60/ADR cells were seeded at a density of 1×105
cells in a 6-well plate and incubated in the presence
of either ADR (10 μM) alone or in combination with
ZSTK474 (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 μM) for 3 h at 37°C [25,
34]. Cells were collected and washed twice with cold
PBS, and the mean intracellular fluorescence intensity
associated with ADR was measured with a flow cytometer
at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission
wavelength of 575 nm.

Determination of intracellular accumulation of
Rh123 and 5-CFDA
The fluorescence intensity of intracellular Rh123
and 5-CFDA accumulation was determined by flow
cytometry as reported [5, 35]. Cells were harvested,
washed with PBS and incubated with the P-gp substrate
Rh123 (0.05 μM) or MRP1 substrate 5-CFDA (0.05
μM) for 0.5 h at 37°C in the dark. Then, the cells were
collected, washed, and further incubated at 37°C in the
presence of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 μM of ZSTK474. After 3
h, the cells were washed again, and the fluorescence was
determined by flow cytometry analysis at an excitation
wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 535
nm.

Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution
and apoptosis
Assessment of cell cycle distribution was performed
by flow cytometry analysis as previously described by us
[32]. Briefly, 2 ml of cell suspension (5×105 cells/ml) was
seeded in a 6-well plate. After treatment with 0, 0.1, 0.5,
1 and 2 μM of ZSTK474 for 48 h, cells were collected,
washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol
overnight at 4°C. The cell suspension was centrifuged,
and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 μg/ml of PI
solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 2% RNase A.
The treated cells were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark
at 4°C and analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Annexin V and PI staining assays were conducted
to detect apoptosis induced by ZSTK474 as we described
previously [12, 33]. A FITC Annexin V Apoptosis
Detection Kit was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. HL60 and HL60/ADR cells were treated with
different concentrations of ZSTK474 for 48 h. Then, the
cells were collected, washed twice with cold PBS and
resuspended in 1×binding buffer. Approximately 105
cells were stained with 2.5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 2.5
μl of PI in 100 μl of binding buffer for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark, followed by analysis with a FACS
Verse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was conducted as we
previously reported [36, 37]. Total protein and nuclear
protein were exacted from HL60 and HL60/ADR cells
by using a RIPA lysis buffer-based protocol (Roche
Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and a NE-PER Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. Protein concentrations
were quantified by using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of protein were
subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked in 5%

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from HL60 or HL60/ADR cells was
isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the RNA concentration was
determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Quantitative RTPCR was performed as we previously described [38].
Briefly, 0.5 μg of RNA was synthesized to cDNA by
using a PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix Kit (Takara, Tokyo,
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
quantitative PCR reaction was carried out by using a
CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD,
Hercules, CA, USA). The sequences of p27 primers
were
5’-TGCAACCGACGATTCTTCTACTCAA-3’
(sense) and 5’-CAAGCAGTGATGTATCTGATAAAC-3’
(antisense). GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene
to normalize RNA expression, with the primers as
5’-GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-3’ (sense) and
5’-GGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA-3’ (antisense). The
relative gene expression levels were quantified by using
the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method.

Synergism assay
Isobologram analysis (Chou-Talalay model) was
used to determine the type of interaction (synergistic,
additive or antagonistic effect) occurring when
ZSTK474 was administered in combination with the
chemotherapeutic drugs. The combination index (CI) for
the experimental combinations (with a ratio of 1:1 for
ZSTK474 and the chemotherapeutic drugs) was calculated
by using CalcuSyn software [39, 40]. CI > 1 indicates
antagonism, CI = 1 indicates additive effect, and CI < 1
indicates synergism. All experiments were carried out in
triplicate.
