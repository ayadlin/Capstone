BACKGROUND. Brain metastases are an alarming complication of advanced melanoma, frequently contributing to patient demise. The authors performed a retrospective analysis to determine whether the treatment of metastatic melanoma
with biochemotherapy would result in similar outcomes if brain metastases were
first controlled with aggressive, central nervous system (CNS)-directed treatment.

METHODS. Seventy melanoma patients were treated with biochemotherapy for
metastatic melanoma between 1999 and 2005. Of these, 20 patients had recently
diagnosed brain metastases, whereas 50 did not. Brain metastases (if present)
were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery 28 days prior to systemic therapy.

All patients were treated with biochemotherapy consisting of either dacarbazine
or temozolomide in combination with a 96-hour continuous intravenous infusion
of interleukin-2 and subcutaneous interferon-a-2B. The primary endpoint was
survival from the time of the initial diagnosis of metastatic disease.

RESULTS. Median survival from the time of the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma
was 15.8 months for patients with brain metastases and 11.1 months for those
without CNS involvement (P 5 .26 by the log-rank test; P 5 .075 by the Gehan
Wilcoxon test). Dacarbazine-based and temozolomide-based regimens appeared
similar with regard to their effect on overall survival and CNS disease progression. A plateau in further brain recurrences was observed in patients who survived for >20 months.

CONCLUSIONS. Data from the current study suggest that the outcome of bio-

chemotherapy is comparable in patients with and those without brain metastases, if brain metastases are controlled with multidisciplinary treatment.

he overall survival rate for patients with malignant melanoma
has gradually improved over the last 25 years. Four decades ago,
60% of patients who were diagnosed with melanoma died as a
result, compared with 11% currently.1 Early detection combined
with improved surgical strategies have accounted for the majority of
this improvement. In contrast, the prognosis of patients diagnosed
with stage IV melanoma has remained grave. Median survival has
not changed much over the last decade and remains between 6
months to 10 months overall.2,3 This disturbing statistic is, in part,
explained by a lack of active agents for the treatment of melanoma.4
In addition, frequent involvement of the central nervous system
(CNS) by malignant melanoma adds substantially to mortality. Clinically apparent brain metastases develop in at least 18% to 46% of

patients with stage IV disease.5,6 Autopsy series
report roughly twice this prevalence of brain metastases in patients dying of melanoma.6–9 Factors that
may be associated with the development of brain
metastases include male gender and mucosal or
head and neck primary tumors, as well as deep or
ulcerated lesions.10 The development of brain metastases often leads directly to the patient’s death.9,10
Identification of a solitary CNS metastasis from
melanoma that is amenable to potentially curative
surgical resection is relatively uncommon, and
patients generally have been treated with wholebrain radiotherapy (WBRT). In larger series of melanoma patients with brain metastases, the median
survival of those treated with WBRT has reportedly
ranged from 3.6 months to 4.8 months.10–13 Fife
et al. recently published treatment results from 686
patients with melanoma brain metastases who were
treated between 1985 and 2000 by the Sydney Melanoma Unit.14 These investigators found a median
survival of 8.7 months to 8.9 months in 205 patients
treated with surgery with or without subsequent
radiotherapy, whereas patients treated with WBRT
(236 patients) had a median survival of 3.4 months
and patients who received supportive care only (210
patients) had a median survival of only 2.1 months.
Due to the perception of a very poor prognosis,
the majority of clinical trials currently exclude all
patients with melanoma brain metastases. We and
others have reported the successful treatment of
brain metastases patients using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or gamma-knife-based radiotherapy in
small numbers of patients.15–18 Due to the suggestion
of prolonged survival being achievable with SRSbased treatment of brain metastases, we have
included all patients with systemic metastatic disease, including those with recently diagnosed brain
metastases, in institutional treatment protocols. We
performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated
with biochemotherapy between 1999 and 2006 to
analyze the impact of brain metastases on eventual
treatment outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
After institutional review board approval of this retrospective review, we used institutional records to
identify 70 patients with American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV melanoma who had been
treated with biochemotherapy at the Huntsman Cancer Institute between October 1999 and March 2006.
Clinical information obtained included age, gender,
date of initial melanoma diagnosis, location of the
primary lesion, date of extracranial disease recur-

rence, date of diagnosis of brain metastases, treatment of CNS disease, date of first cycle of
biochemotherapy, number of cycles and type of biochemotherapy administered, best clinical response,
and date of last clinical follow-up or death.

Clinical Management Strategy
Neurosurgery, WBRT, and SRS were employed in a
multidisciplinary approach to manage 36 patients
with CNS involvement from malignant melanoma
(20 of whom had metastatic disease at presentation
and 16 of whom developed metastases during or
after biochemotherapy). Patients were not excluded
from treatment based on the type of CNS involvement. One patient with meningeal melanoma in
addition to brain parenchyma lesions was included as
were all patients with brain metastases (range, 1–20
metastases). In the group of 20 patients with brain
metastases at the time of initial presentation, treatment incorporated neurosurgery in 55%, WBRT in
55%, and SRS in 80% of patients. Two modalities were
combined in 70% of patients and all 3 modalities
were employed in 20% of patients. Sixteen patients
without intracranial metastases from malignant melanoma later developed disease progression in the CNS.
A similar treatment approach was employed to treat
the 16 patients with delayed CNS disease progression
(these patients are included in this report).
Use of Surgical Resection and WBRT
Neurosurgery was employed to treat single accessible
cortical lesions and for tissue diagnosis (if necessary).
SRS was used as the primary treatment modality if
patients had 5 brain metastases. WBRT with or
without an SRS boost to dominant lesions was
employed in patients with more than 5 brain metastases. WBRT was delivered in standard fashion,
employing a dose of 30 gray (Gy) in 10 fractions.
SRS Planning and Treatment
Patients were treated with a BrainLABTM m31 micromultileaf collimator (BrainLAB AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) attached to a Clinac 21EX1 (Varian, Salt Lake
City, UT) or a Novalis1 (BrainLAB AG) SRS unit.
High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
(2-mm T1-postgadolinium) images were used to
define target volumes and risk structures after fusion
to computed tomography (CT) scans obtained with a
stereotactic localizer frame (BrainLAB AG). BrainSCAN1 (BrainLAB AG) software was used to fuse the
images and plan the SRS with dynamic conformal
arc techniques. This allowed each lesion to be treated with a single isocenter, with total treatments
times of <1 hour for up to 5 metastases. The treat-

Melanoma Biochemotherapy and CNS Metastases/Majer et al.

ment dose was prescribed to the isodose line, which
covered 95% of the target volume (range, 74–96%).
Conformity indices were calculated for each lesion,
as described by Nakamura et al.19 The planned
radiotherapy dose was based on the maximum dimension of the metastasis as follows: <2 cm, 22 Gy;
2 to 3 cm, 18 Gy; and 3cm, 15 Gy. Patients with
lesions measuring >4 cm were usually not considered for SRS.

Systemic Therapy
All patients with metastatic melanoma were considered for biochemotherapy. Reasons for nontreatment
included personal preference or significant coronary
artery disease. This accounted for only 4 potentially
eligible patients. Two patients were treated for metastatic ocular melanoma with biochemotherapy and
were excluded from this analysis. One additional
patient was treated for high-risk, stage III melanoma
in an adjuvant fashion and did not meet eligibility
requirements for this analysis. No patients were
found to have brain metastasis only (recursive partitioning analysis [RPA] class I).
We utilized 2 biochemotherapy regimens during
the time of this study. Regimen 1 (1999–2002) was
comprised of dacarbazine at a dose of 800 mg/m2
given intravenously (iv) on Day 1; interleukin-2 (IL-2)
given at a dose of 9 million IU/m2/day as a 96-hour,
continuous iv infusion; and interferon-a-2B (IFN-a2B) at a dose of 5 million U/m2 given subcutaneously on Days 1 to 5, 8, 10, and 12. In Regimen 2
(2002–2005), dacarbazine was replaced by temozolomide at a dose of 150 mg/m2 orally on Days 1–4,
combined with IL-2 and IFN-a-2B, as described
above. This change was instituted due to the high
frequency of brain metastases and the theoretic benefit of temozolomide penetration into the CNS.
Objective response to biochemotherapy was assessed
by CT scans after every second cycle of treatment in
each patient, based on maximum unidimensional tumor measurements (including within the CNS).
Patients who had a 25% reduction in the sum
of maximum unidimensional tumor measurements
on radiographs were considered to have a partial
response (both in the CNS and at extracranial sites).
Disease progression was considered to be a > 20%
increase in the sum of maximum unidimensional
tumor measurements or from maximum treatment
response. Patients with stable disease or an objective
response were allowed to continue to receive treatment. Disease progression or intolerable toxicity led
to the discontinuation of biochemotherapy. In
patients without brain metastases, CNS imaging was
performed at the time of the development of new

1331

neurologic symptoms or at disease progression.
Patients with previously treated brain metastasis
were followed approximately every 2 months with
brain MRI scans, with the intent of employing additional treatment (eg, SRS or WBRT) to control CNS
disease progression.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this retrospective analysis
was overall survival from the time of diagnosis of
metastatic disease. Survival was defined as the time
(in months) from the date of diagnosis of stage IV
melanoma until death or last clinical follow-up. Survival from the date of the administration of the first
cycle of biochemotherapy also was calculated. Comparisons of overall survival and the time to CNS
treatment failure were analyzed using the KaplanMeier method20 and P values were calculated using
the log-rank test21 and Gehan Wilcoxon test.22
Subset analyses were performed on 50 patients
who were initially without CNS involvement based
on time to CNS failure after biochemotherapy as well
as based on the type of biochemotherapy regimen
employed (dacarbazine-based or temozolomidebased). The effect of age, gender, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group Zubrod performance status, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), site of primary melanoma,
time to extracranial metastatic disease progression,
and type of treatment of CNS metastatic disease also
were evaluated for their effect on overall survival
using univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. The
Fisher exact test was used for a comparison of dichotomous variables. Statistical significance was
established at a probability level of <.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 6.0 software (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK).

RESULTS
We identified 70 patients with stage IV melanoma
who were treated with biochemotherapy at the
Huntsman Cancer Institute between October 1999
and September 2005. Of these, 20 patients were
found to have brain metastases during initial staging
and concurrently with extracranial metastases. An
additional 50 patients were found to have had extracranial metastases only. Characteristics of these
groups are shown (Table 1). The groups did not differ
significantly, with the exception of AJCC stage (58%
vs 100%; P 5 .0025). It should be noted that, by definition, brain metastases result in a stage IVC designation. There was a trend toward more organ
involvement in patients with brain metastases: 90%
of patients (18 of 20 patients) with brain involvement
had 3 organs sites involved, whereas only 76% of

patients (38 of 50 patients) without brain involvement had 3 organ sites involved. However, this difference did not prove to be statistically significant
(P 5 .32 by the Fisher exact test). Zubrod performance status and LDH were used as indirect measures
of tumor burden, and were found to be similar in
both groups. All 20 patients with CNS involvement
belonged to RPA class II. Thirteen patients were
aged >65 years.
The apparent response to biochemotherapy
treatment noted in melanoma patients with or without treated brain metastases is shown in Table 2. The

number of biochemotherapy cycles administered to
the 2 groups was not statistically significantly different. Patients with brain metastases received a median of 3.4 5 2.7 (mean  standard deviation) cycles
of biochemotherapy versus 2.9  1.4 cycles in
patients without brain metastases. A comparison of
response rates in both groups also was performed,
comparing the sum of maximum unidimensional
tumor measurements between scans. Patients with
brain metastases had a 5% objective response rate
versus a rate of 14% in patients without brain involvement. Results were also calculated to include
patients who appeared to be obtaining a therapeutic
benefit from treatment. This was necessary because
some patients with brain metastases were found to
have stable brain findings on MRI, even in the presence of objective responses at extracranial sites.
Therapeutic benefit was calculated by adding
patients with stable disease to those with objective
responses. A total of 44% of patients with brain metastases had achieved a therapeutic benefit from biochemotherapy versus 42% in the group without brain
metastasis.
Overall survival from the time of diagnosis of
stage IV malignant melanoma for both groups was
analyzed (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the median survival
from the time of diagnosis in patients with brain metastases was 15.8 months, compared with 11.1
months for 50 patients without CNS involvement
(P 5 .26 by the log-rank test; P 5 .075 by the Wilcoxon
test). The 1-year and 2-year survival rates in patients

with brain metastases were 65% and 15%, respectively, whereas patients without brain metastases had
rates of 48% and 18%, respectively. Another unexpected finding was that none of the 20 patients with
brain metastases died within first 6 months after
diagnosis, despite the delay in the onset of biochemotherapy to allow for the treatment of the brain
metastases and resolution of any treatment-related
edema (Fig. 1). This markedly exceeded the expected
median survival derived from WBRT treatment series.
Analysis of survival measured from the date of the
first administered cycle of biochemotherapy also was
performed (Fig. 2). The median survival from the
onset of biochemotherapy for 20 patients with brain
metastases was 8.1 months and was 7.1 months for
50 patients without CNS involvement (P 5 .64 by the
log-rank test; P 5 .54 by the Gehan Wilcoxon test).
The majority of patients were subsequently able to
receive second-line or third-line therapy after failure
of biochemotherapy.
Of the 50 patients without brain metastases at
the time of diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, 16
(32%) eventually developed CNS involvement as a
site of treatment failure after biochemotherapy. Overall survival (12.5 months) for the 16 patients who
eventually developed CNS progression during or after
biochemotherapy did not differ significantly from
that of the 34 patients who never had any brain metastases. On univariate analysis, gender was the only
variable found to be predictive of CNS failure. Nine
of 14 women (64%) developed brain recurrences
compared with 7 of 36 men (19%) (P 5 .002). The
gender-related difference remained significant on
multivariate analysis (P 5 .016). The type of biochemotherapy (temozolomide vs dacarbazine) was

1333

not found to be significant on multivariate analysis
(P 5 .35). There was no apparent difference with
regard to time to CNS disease progression when
comparing dacarbazine chemotherapy and temozolomide, although the sample size was small. The 1year brain metastasis-free survival rate was nearly
identical: 76.4%  12.1% for dacarbazine-based biochemotherapy and 76.6%  6.4% for temozolomidebased biochemotherapy. No statistical difference was
apparent when comparing 4 of 14 patients (28.6%)
who developed brain metastases after dacarbazinebased biochemotherapy with 12 of 36 patients
(33.3%) treated with temozolomide-based biochemotherapy. There also did not appear to be a difference
in overall survival when comparing the entire data
set of all 70 patients based on the type of biochemotherapy (dacarbazine vs temozolomide). The median survival of 17 patients treated with dacarbazinebased biochemotherapy was 11.9 months versus 12.8
months for 53 patients treated with temozolomidebased biochemotherapy. In 4 patients, CNS disease
recurrence was the only sign of treatment failure. All
patients had 5 new lesions, and these patients
underwent SRS-based treatment as salvage therapy,
with the addition of surgery or WBRT in 3 of these
patients. Of these 4 patients, 3 patients had been
treated with dacarbazine-based biotherapy and 1
patient was treated with temozolomide-based biochemotherapy.
Only 1 of 20 patients with brain metastases at
the time of diagnosis developed radiation necrosis
and required surgical resection for control of symptoms. This patient had been treated with both SRS
plus WBRT. One additional patient (of 16) who developed brain metastases after biochemotherapy
required surgical resection of a necrotic CNS metastasis after SRS and WBRT of a brain metastasis that
developed after biochemotherapy. No patient treated
with SRS alone developed radiation necrosis in a
brain metastasis that required surgical intervention.
The time to CNS failure after biochemotherapy
also was analyzed in patients who were free of brain
metastases at the onset of treatment (Fig. 3). This
analysis demonstrated a surprising finding: there
appeared to be a plateau in CNS disease recurrences
after 13 months (temozolomide-based biochemotherapy) and 20 months (dacarbazine-based biochemotherapy) in patients who appeared to have the most
durable extracranial responses to treatment.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, little consensus currently exists
regarding standard therapy for those approximately

1334

FIGURE 3. Central nervous system recurrence-free survival.

8000 patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. with
metastatic melanoma.23 This most likely reflects the
low level of activity of all available agents.24 The
alkylating agent dacarbazine remains a standard of
care in community practice, and is a frequent comparator for new regimens.25,26 Temozolomide, a
related oral imidazo-netetrazine, has better cerebrospinal fluid penetration.27,28 Both dacarbazine and
temozolomide are converted to the same active
metabolite, MTIC, that is responsible for DNA O6
guanosine methylation.29 Both dacarbazine and
temozolomide result in response rates of approximately 10% to 20%, with a median duration of 3 to 4
months.26,28,30 A small randomized trial comparing
dacarbazine and temozolomide as initial chemotherapy of metastatic melanoma demonstrated similar response rates and survival.30 Initial reports of
combination chemotherapy, such as the so-called
‘‘Dartmouth regimen’’ (dacarbazine, carmustine, cisplatin, and tamoxifen) suggested markedly improved
response rates in small phase 2 trials.31 These
encouraging results were not confirmed in phase 3
prospective randomized trials.32,33 In fact, median
survival after combination chemotherapy proved to
be no better than that observed after dacarbazine
treatment alone.34
IL-2 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic
melanoma in 1998. High-dose iv bolus IL-2 treatment resulted in overall objective response rates of
approximately 12% to 21%.35,36 IL-2 was able to
induce durable complete responses and prolonged
survival in a small minority (approximately 5%) of
patients with metastatic melanoma, albeit with high
levels of toxicity.37,38 Legha et al. subsequently pioneered a concept of ‘‘biochemotherapy’’ using cispla-

tin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in combination
with a 96-hour continuous iv infusion of IL-2 and
subcutaneous IFN-a-2B (CVD biochemotherapy).39,40
In early single-institution phase 2 trials, CVD biochemotherapy was claimed to have achieved
response rates of 60%, with complete responses
noted in up to 24%.41 Subsequent larger clinical trials
could not replicate these high response rates. A randomized trial by Eton et al. suggested a 3-month
improvement in progression-free survival with CVD
biochemotherapy compared with CVD chemotherapy
alone.42 An as-yet unpublished Intergroup study
(E3695) was closed at interim analysis because a statistical difference with regard to CVD versus CVD biochemotherapy was unlikely.43 Unfortunately, only a
small number of centers are currently able to administer this complex and relatively toxic inpatient regimen.
Additional attempts to decrease the toxicity of biochemotherapy by administering subcutaneous, outpatient IL-2 also have not demonstrated a benefit for
biochemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.44–46
Melanoma is responsible for 10% of all brain metastases and ranks second highest in incidence proportion percentage for brain metastases from all
solid tumors.47 Brain involvement leads directly to
death in the majority of patients.9 CNS involvement
occurs with such a high frequency in patients with
metastatic melanoma that brain metastases must be
expected and management strategies incorporated
into the overall treatment plan. Therefore, we have
taken an aggressive approach for the detection and
treatment of brain metastases. If brain metastases
are identified, patients are aggressively treated using
an SRS-based paradigm. Our institutional experience
in 44 patients with CNS metastases undergoing multidisciplinary treatment incorporating SRS between
1999 and 2004 found a median survival of 11.1
months.18 This prior report was restricted to patients
receiving SRS at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and
did not include patients treated at other institutions.
Twenty patients of the 44 in the report were eventually treated with biochemotherapy. Seventeen
patients from that study are included in the current
analysis. Eleven were patients who were treated with
SRS-based radiotherapy prior to the initiation of biochemotherapy. Six additional patients required SRS
after CNS failure after biochemotherapy. Due to the
protracted control of brain metastases obtained
using this approach, we hypothesized that patients
with appropriately treated brain metastases might
have outcomes after biochemotherapy that are similar to those of patients without brain metastases.
The purpose of the current study was not to
evaluate the effectiveness of this biochemotherapy

Melanoma Biochemotherapy and CNS Metastases/Majer et al.

regimen but rather to measure the impact of brain
metastases on outcome in patients eligible for IL-2based treatment. The results of the current study
demonstrated that biochemotherapy resulted in a
comparable outcome regardless of whether a patient
was diagnosed with brain metastases. Overall survival was found to be similar in both groups, with
the trend actually favoring the group of patients with
CNS metastatic involvement. Objective responses
were noted in 13% of patients in the current study
(including both CNS and extracranial sites). Only 1
patient achieved a complete response (1.4%) and a
second patient was converted to a complete response
by surgical resection of a solitary residual site of disease. This objective response rate, although low,
appears comparable to that reported in other previous biochemotherapy studies.48 The therapeutic benefit rate (incorporating patients with objective
responses and stable disease) was calculated in our
patients because it became apparent that prolonged
disease stabilization was being observed in a number
of them. This finding resulted because SRS-treated
CNS lesions were frequently interpreted as being
‘‘stable’’ on MRI scans. Of note, the 20 patients with
brain metastases had lower apparent objective
response rates but a similar therapeutic benefit rate
compared with patients without CNS metastases. It
should be noted that 42% of 37 patients
surviving >12 months from the time of diagnosis of
metastatic melanoma had stable disease as their best
response to biochemotherapy, whereas only 3%
achieved a complete response and 13% a partial
response. Of the 12 patients alive over 24 months,
46% had stable disease as their best response to biochemotherapy, whereas only 8% achieved a complete
response and 17% a partial response. The current
study results raise concerns regarding the relevance
of the endpoints used to judge the outcome of clinical trials in patients with brain metastases. Our data
suggest that the percentage of patients alive at 1 or
2 years may be of significant value in interpreting
the clinical benefit of melanoma treatment. It
should be noted that nearly all of the current study
patients were able to receive additional salvage
treatment after disease progression after biochemotherapy, including clinical trials with chemotherapy
and vaccines.
Improved CNS penetration of temozolomide has
been postulated to decrease CNS melanoma recurrences.27,28 The role of temozolomide in the treatment of established brain metastases is also not
clear. A large phase 2 study of temozolomide as the
primary treatment of brain metastases found a very
low response rate and median progression-free sur-

1335

vival of only 2 months.49 In studies of temozolomide
in combination with WBRT, Antonadou et al.
reported a high response rate (96%) for the combination of temozolomide with WBRT in a randomized
phase 2 trial in brain metastases derived from a variety of cancers.50 Unfortunately, this did not translate
into improved overall survival. Margolin et al.
reported another phase 2 study of temozolomide
plus WBRT that was restricted to melanoma patients
with brain metastases. None of the patients in this
study had received prior chemotherapy. Response
rates were much lower, with only 1 patient of 31
achieving a complete response. The median overall
survival was a disappointing 6 months (similar to
historic controls).51 It also should be noted that CNS
progression of melanoma is rarely independent of
extracranial disease. Thus, patients with controlled
CNS metastases may still die of their disease if the
extracranial component is not treated effectively.
In the current study, 53 patients were treated
with temozolomide-based biochemotherapy versus
17 patients who were treated with dacarbazine-based
treatment. We performed an exploratory analysis of
the 50 patients without brain metastases prior to biochemotherapy to evaluate the role of dacarbazine
versus temozolomide. There was no significant difference noted with regard to overall survival. The 14
patients who received dacarbazine had a 28.6% incidence of new CNS metastases versus a 33.3% risk in
the 36 patients who were treated using temozolomide-based biochemotherapy (difference not statistically significant). Thus, the results of the current
study do not suggest that temozolomide-based biochemotherapy is superior to dacarbazine-based treatment for the prevention of new melanoma brain
metastases, although only a small number of patients
in the current study were treated with dacarbazine.
A comparison of the 16 patients who initially did
not have brain metastases at the time of presentation
but who subsequently developed them after biochemotherapy versus the 34 patients who never
developed brain involvement demonstrated that
female gender was the only variable associated with
an increased risk of CNS disease progression. This
finding was surprising and unexplained because
female gender is generally regarded as a good prognostic factor in overall melanoma survival. Only 4 of
these 16 patients developed disease recurrence with
isolated CNS metastases without extracranial disease
progression. It is interesting to note that 3 of these 4
patients had been treated with dacarbazine, compared with 1 patient who received temozolomidebased biochemotherapy. All patients were retreated
using either SRS, surgery, or WBRT.

Another unexpected finding was a plateau in
CNS disease recurrence approximately 13 to 20
months after both temozolomide-based or dacarbazine-based biochemotherapy. This finding suggests
the hypothesis that metastatic reseeding of the brain
from extracranial sources diminishes and becomes
self-limited with effective systemic therapy if CNS
disease is controlled with SRS-based therapy.
In conclusion, all currently available agents used
to treat melanoma are, at best, minimally active.
More effective disease remission-inducing agents are
badly needed. Although biochemotherapy has
demonstrated minimal impact on median progression-free survival rates, its value, similar to that of
high-dose IL-2, is in the 5% to 10% of patients who
achieve durable remission or stable disease with prolonged survival. A major hypothesis generated from
the results of the current study is that patients with
adequately treated brain metastases from melanoma
can have overall survival rates that are equivalent to
patients with metastatic disease without CNS involvement. To date, such patients have been excluded
from clinical trials, which does not appear warranted. As with all small, single-institution retrospective analyses or phase 2 trials, the results of the
current study should be interpreted with caution.
Although we attempted to include all eligible
patients in our treatment analysis, there may well be
institution-related referral, screening, and treatment
biases that are difficult to characterize. We present
these promising results in the hope of encouraging
verification of this treatment approach in multi-institution trials.
