Dexamethasone Destabilizes Nmyc to Inhibit the Growth of
Hedgehog-Associated Medulloblastoma
Vivi M. Heine1, Markus Priller4, Jason Ling3, David H. Rowitch1,2, and Ulrich Schüller4

Abstract
Mouse studies indicate that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) impairs the proliferation of
granule neuron precursors in the cerebellum, which are transformed to medulloblastoma by activation of
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Here, we show that Dex treatment also inhibits Shh-induced tumor growth,
enhancing the survival of tumor-prone transgenic mice. We found that Nmyc was specifically required in granule cells for Shh-induced tumorigenesis and that Dex acted to reduce Nmyc protein levels. Moreover, we found
that Dex-induced destabilization of Nmyc is mediated by activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, which
targets Nmyc for proteasomal degradation. Together, our findings show that Dex antagonizes Shh signaling
downstream of Smoothened in medulloblastoma. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5220–5. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. Despite significant advances in treatment
strategies, many children die from this tumor due to the lack
of therapeutic options that specifically target tumor-initiating
and tumor-propagating mechanisms (1). One mechanism
known to drive the growth of medulloblastoma in about
25% of human cases is constitutive activation of the Sonic
hedgehog-Smoothened (Shh-Smo) signaling pathway in cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP; refs. 2, 3). Whereas
in a normal situation, Shh signaling is only active in a precisely defined period of late embryonic and early postnatal cerebellar development, mutations in the Hedgehog pathway
suppressor Patched or alterations of other pathway components result in permanent pathway activation and tumor formation (2, 4).
Both in mice and humans, these tumors display expression
of the transcription factor Nmyc (3, 5), the stabilization of
which prohibits cell cycle exit in normal development and

medulloblastoma (5, 6). Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling by
small molecule drugs has proved to effectively block the
growth of medulloblastoma in mice (7), but significant side
effects have been noted with some inhibitors (8).
We have previously shown that treatment with dexamethasone (Dex), a clinically used synthetic glucocorticoid, is
able to inhibit Shh-induced CGNP proliferation both in vitro
and in vivo at early neonatal stages (P0–P7) of cerebellar development (9). Now, we show that Dex treatment in P21 tumor-prone mice inhibits the growth of Shh-Smo–driven
medulloblastoma and significantly prolongs survival. Genetic
deletion of Nmyc in Math1-cre:SmoM2–associated medulloblastoma similarly resulted in inhibited tumor growth and
prolonged survival. We show that Dex treatment results in
decreased Nmyc protein levels and is associated with increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β),
which is known to promote destabilization through terminal
phosphorylation of Nmyc in the MB1 domain (10).

Materials and Methods
Animals and animal treatment
All mouse procedures were done in accordance with National Research Council recommendations. SmoM2Fl/Fl (Gt
(ROSA)26Sortm1(Smo/EYFP)Amc/J) mice (11) were obtained from
Andrew P. McMahon (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA).
Generation and characterization of Nmyc Fl/Fl as well as
Math1-cre transgenic animals have been previously described
(12, 13). Genotyping was done by PCR analysis using genomic
DNA from mouse tail biopsies. Primers have been previously
published. Mice were i.p. injected with 3 μg/g Dex (Sigma)
daily; controls received equivalent volumes of saline vehicle.
Histology, in situ hybridization, and
immunohistochemistry
For conventional histology and immunohistochemistry,
mouse brains were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and

done as previously published (13). For immunohistochemistry, sections were subjected to heat antigen retrieval at 99°C
in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer for all antibodies. Stain-

according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunofluorescence stainings were done using standard conditions with
Alexa goat anti-rabbit and Alexa goat anti-mouse secondary

Signaling), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Chemicon), and caspase-3 (Cell Signaling).
Cell culture
Primary cultures from Math1-cre:SmoM2 tumors were
established by triturating tumor tissue from 21-day-old
medulloblastoma-bearing mice in DMEM and plating the
cells on poly-D-lysine–coated dishes. Cells were maintained
in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Sigma) and treated with
200 μmol/L Dex and 10 μmol/L lactacystin (Calbiochem).
Reverse transcription-PCR
For RNA extraction, primary cultured tumor cells were
homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen) before chloroform was
added. After a 3-minute incubation, homogenates were
centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase
was collected and precipitated with 350 μL of isopropanol.
The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g
for 15 minutes and resuspended in 100 μL of RNase-free
H 2 O. Before continuing with reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR), RNA was cleaned up with an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen).
RT-PCR was done on isolated RNAs with an Advantage RTfor-PCR Kit (Clontech) and the following primers: Nmyc forward, 5′-GGGGGCTCAGGCTCTTCGCTTTTG-3′; Nmyc
reverse, 5′-CCCGCCGTGGTCTTCCCCTTCC-3′; Gli1 forward,

5′-ACAGCGGGGGCAGAAGTCG-3′; Gli1 reverse, 5′CCTCAGCCCCAGTATCCCCAGTCG-3′. For β-actin, the
Mouse β-Actin Control Amplimer Set (Clontech) was used.
Western blotting
To detect proteins by immunoblotting, nondenaturing lysates were prepared from CGNPs as described previously (5).
Immunoblots were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: cyclin D1 (Neomarkers, Ab-3),
β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), Gli1 (Santa Cruz), Nmyc (Calbiochem), PT58Nmyc (Abcam), PS54Nmyc (Abcam), GSK3B (BD
Biosciences), PSer9GSK3αβ (Cell Signaling), and PT216GSK3β
(Invitrogen). Subsequently, immunoblots were developed
using HRP-conjugated antirabbit (Pierce) or antimouse
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham).

Results and Discussion
Systemic treatment of wild-type mice with Dex inhibits
Shh-induced proliferation of CGNPs (9). To investigate
whether Dex treatment would have an effect on medulloblastoma, we used an established Math1-cre:SmoM2 mouse
model (2). These mice express a mutated Smoothened protein (SmoM2) in Math1-positive cerebellar granule cells and

develop medulloblastomas with 100% penetrance and an average survival of 35 days.
We treated Math1-cre:SmoM2 animals with a daily i.p. dose
of 3 μg/g Dex. Control animals received saline injections.
Treatment was started at P10, a time point by which all
CGNP have undergone neoplastic transformation in Math1cre:SmoM2 animals (2). Macroscopic examination of the
brains at day 21 revealed that Dex-treated animals had significantly smaller brains (data not shown), in keeping with
previous studies (9). Whereas the tumor cell morphology of
Dex-treated tumors and that of tumors from mice that received control injections for 11 days were similar, tumor sizes
grossly differed between the two groups (Fig. 1A). Indeed, as
measured by the weight ratio of the cerebellum including medulloblastoma and the total brain, medulloblastomas from
Dex-treated animals (n = 4) were significantly smaller than
those from controls (n = 5; P < 0.001). These data indicate that
Dex treatment was able to inhibit the growth of Shh-associated medulloblastoma, and that such inhibition was disproportionate compared with the general growth of the brain.
Analysis of pH3, PCNA, and cleaved caspase-3 expression revealed that mitotic activity was significantly reduced whereas
apoptotic activity was significantly enhanced in Dex-treated
tumors (P < 0.05, P < 0.02, and P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 1B).
Next, we analyzed whether Dex treatment was associated
with an altered survival of Math1-cre:SmoM2 animals and
found that Dex-treated mice (n = 16) survived significantly
longer than saline-treated mice (n = 15, P < 0.02; Fig. 1C).
In particular, Dex-treated animals showed an average surviv-

al of 25 days after the start of treatment, whereas salinetreated mice already died after an average of 16 days.
To further decipher the mechanisms of Dex-induced inhibition of tumor growth, we asked whether the transcription
of Shh-target genes in CGNP was affected. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR analysis did not reveal any differences in mRNA levels of Nmyc or Gli1 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Nmyc protein levels
were reduced in tumors from Dex-treated animals by almost
30%, whereas Gli protein levels were unchanged. These results indicate that treatment of medulloblastoma with Dex
does not regulate the transcription of primary target genes,
Gli and Nmyc. It has, however, a significant effect on Nmyc
protein levels. Although these findings are in agreement with
previous findings in developing CGNP (9), we note that the
dose of Dex required to achieve these effects in transformed
CGNP of medulloblastoma is 30-fold higher. This difference
presumably reflects the strong activation effects of SmoM2.
Previous data have shown that Nmyc and Gli proteins play
critical, and possibly overlapping, roles in driving the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors (4, 5). To assess a
specific requirement for Nmyc in CGNP per se, we generated
Math1-cre:NmycFl/FlSmoM2 mice and assessed their survival
versus Math1-cre:SmoM2 tumor-prone animals.
As shown in Fig. 2A, 15% of the Math1-cre:NmycFl/FlSmoM2
mice displayed cerebella with a dramatically altered morphology and a nearly complete depletion of granule neurons.
Most importantly, they did not develop medulloblastoma, indicating that SmoM2-induced medulloblastomas require
Nmyc function in CGNPs. Interestingly, in the 85% of

cells results in proteasome-mediated
destabilization of Nmyc and enhanced GSK3β
activity. A, Dex treatment reduced the levels of
Nmyc in Math1-cre:SmoM2 medulloblastoma
cells in vitro. Addition of the proteasome
inhibitor lactacystin resulted in accumulation of
total Nmyc. PT58Nmyc levels, but not PS54Nmyc
levels, were increased after Dex treatment
relative to β-tubulin loading controls.
Histograms on the right delineate densitometric
quantification. B, reduced cyclin D1 and total
Nmyc levels were detected after 3 and 6 h of
Dex treatment. The levels of phosphorylated
Nmyc were decreased, suggesting rapid Nmyc
turnover after Dex treatment. Consistent with
this, the levels of PSer9GSK3β were decreased,
suggesting increased activity of GSK3β within
this time course. Densitometric quantification is
given on the right.

Math1-cre:NmycFl/FlSmoM2 mice that died from medulloblastoma (Fig. 2B), we observed expression of full-length Nmyc
(Fig. 2C). To see whether this was caused by an incomplete
genomic recombination of the Nmyc allele, we analyzed genomic DNA from tumors of different genotypes using primers
picking up wild-type sequences, floxed sequences, and deleted
Nmyc sequences. As indicated in Fig. 2C, a substantial part of
the Math1-cre:NmycFl/FlSmoM2 tumors retained the floxed allele due to insufficient recombination, a phenomenon that is
well known for the conditional knockout of genes that are required for tumor growth (14). Our results are in agreement
with previously described interactions of Shh and Myc family
members (15) as well as with Nmyc requirements during
cerebellar development (12) and in medulloblastoma (16),
but make two novel points: First, we used Math1 promoter
sequences, which are more specific for granule cell precursors
than the Nestin (which is expressed in multipotent precursors;
ref. 17) or NeuroD2 sequences (which is expressed in CGNP
and molecular layer interneurons; ref. 18). Second, because
our system combines Nmyc deletion and SmoM2 activation
simultaneously, our data indicate a cell-autonomous requirement for Nmyc in CGNPs.
The results above suggested the possibility that the reduced levels of Nmyc proteins in medulloblastoma after
Dex treatment (Fig. 1D) could account for reduced tumor
growth and enhanced survival of Math1-cre:SmoM2. During
normal CGNP development, Nmyc protein destabilization is
mediated by a cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B complex
that phosphorylates Nmyc at S54 followed by terminal phosphorylation of T58 by GSK3β (10, 19). Studies in other systems indicate that glucocorticoids can activate GSK3β
activity (20). We therefore investigated phosphorylation of
Nmyc in primary Math1-cre:SmoM2 tumor cultures treated
with Dex +/− lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor that blocks
Nmyc degradation and permits the detection of altered levels
of unstable/phosphorylated Nmyc (21). As shown in Fig. 3A,
the levels of PS54Nmyc remained almost unchanged after

treatment with Dex and lactacystin. However, the levels of
total Nmyc and PT58Nmyc were significantly increased. These
findings suggested that Dex treatment increased phosphorylation of Nmyc at T58, which promoted proteasome-mediated
degradation. Because GSK3β phosphorylates Nmyc at T58,
we assessed GSK3β activation in Dex-treated medulloblastoma cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, levels of PSer9GSK3αβ, but
not PT216GSK3β, were decreased, indicating an increased
activity of GSK3β. We conclude that Dex may activate
GSK3β, which, in turn, promotes the phosphorylation of
Nmyc at T58 and the degradation of Nmyc proteins. Together, these findings suggest that glucocorticoid signaling
inhibits Shh signaling in medulloblastoma by promoting
degradation of Nmyc.
