ABSTRACT
Resistance to chemotherapy remains a challenge in the clinical management
of diffuse B cell lymphomas despite aggressive chemotherapy such as CHOP and
monoclonal CD20. Here we provide evidence that the apoptosome adaptor protein,
Apaf-1, is mislocalized in primary cells derived from patients with diffuse large B cell
lymphomas (DLBCL). Whereas, the total expression of Apaf-1 did not change, its subcellular localization was significantly different in DLBCL, compared to T cell lymphomas
as well as cells derived from reactive lymphadenopathy biopsies. As expected, Apaf-1
was detected in the cytosolic fractions of non-B cell lymphomas and non-cancerous
tissues; however, in B cell derived lymphomas the protein was detected in membrane
raft sub-domains rather than the cytosol. Disruption of lipid raft structures resulted in
the redistribution of Apaf-1 to the cytosol and restored apoptosis sensitivity of DLBCL.
Furthermore, we identified novel small molecule compounds that target DLBCL by
promoting Apaf-1 release form lipid rafts via mechanisms that involve an increase in
intracellular reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our results implicate
Apaf-1 mislocalization as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for DLBCL, and
provide a novel therapeutic strategy for circumventing the drug refractory nature of
this sub-class of B cell lymphoma.

INTRODUCTION

patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying
the resistance of DLBCL to chemotherapy include
overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins belonging
to the Bcl-2 family and/or the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins) family, thereby resulting in dysregulation of the
apoptotic execution machinery [1].
The apoptotic program is orchestrated by a
cascade of events resulting in the activation of caspases,
either through the ligation of the death receptor
(extrinsic signaling) or by engaging the mitochondrial
amplification pathway (intrinsic signaling). The intrinsic
death pathway is the common mode of chemotherapy-

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is a diverse group
of cancers affecting the lymphatic/hematopoietic system.
There are at least 30 types of NHL, with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular lymphoma
being the most common and aggressive types of NHL.
With timely and appropriate chemotherapy, such as CHOP
and monoclonal CD20 (bivatuzamab), over half of the
DLBCL patients are cured [1]; however, chemoresistance
remains a major challenge, which potentiates the need
for an improved chemotherapeutic strategy in relapsed

induced execution and requires the permeabilization of
the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of death
amplification proteins such as cytochrome C, Smac and
AIF [2]. The cytosolic translocation of cytochrome
C is critical for the formation and activation of the
apoptosome, a death-signaling complex downstream of
the mitochondria [3, 4]. The assembly of the apoptosome
is brought about by the recruitment of cytochrome C and
pro-caspase 9 to the adaptor protein Apaf-1 (Apoptosis
Protease Activating Factor 1) in the presence of dATP,
resulting in the activation of caspase 9, which then
drives the activation of the executioner caspase 3 [5, 6].
Hence, death inhibitory proteins such as Bcl-2 indirectly
inhibit the assembly of the apoptosome by regulating
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization,
while others such as the IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis
Proteins) control apoptotic execution downstream of the
apoptosome by targeting caspase 9 [3].
There is ample evidence to implicate defective
apoptosome assembly in the resistance of cancer cells
to drug-induced apoptosis [7]. To that end, a number of
recent reports demonstrate a link between chemoresistance
and the cellular levels of Apaf-1. For example, epigenetic
regulation of Apaf-1 via its promoter methylation
is associated with apoptosis resistance in malignant
melanoma cells [8] as well as in some leukemias [9, 10];
however, in another study, inactivation of Apaf-1 was
not corroborated in malignant melanoma [11] Defective
apoptosome formation through LOH-mediated repression
of Apaf-1 has also been reported in glioblastoma [10] and
Apaf-1 hypermethylation has been seen in bladder cancer
[12]. Furthermore, loss of Apaf-1 has been linked to tumor
aggressiveness in cervical cancer [13]. Corroborating
the association between an absence or downregulation
of Apaf-1 expression and drug resistance and/or
aggressiveness of cancer, we previously reported a hitherto
undefined mechanism of defective apoptosome signaling
in human B cell lymphoma cell lines by demonstrating
the sequestration of Apaf-1 to the plasma membrane [14].
Here we set out to investigate the clinical relevance
of Apaf-1 mislocalization in primary cells derived from
patients with lymphomas, and to establish a correlation
between Apaf-1 mislocalization and apoptosis sensitivity
in an ex vivo setting. We report that Apaf-1 mislocalization
to lipid raft fractions of the plasma membrane is associated
with a significantly muted response to apoptosis stimuli
in DLBCL and follicular lymphomas. Furthermore,
we identified novel small molecules that restored
chemosensitivity of B cell lymphomas by affecting the
release of Apaf-1 to the cytosol through an increase in
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby
facilitating apoptosis execution. These data provide a
novel mechanism of loss of apoptosome assembly and
function and its association with apoptosis resistance in
clinical B cell lymphomas, which could have potential
implications for the design and development of novel

therapeutic strategies against the aggressive and refractory
variants of B cell lymphoma.

RESULTS
Primary cells from B cell lymphoma patients are
resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents
In order to understand the precise mechanism
underlying the resistance of human B cell lymphomas
to drug-induced apoptosis, we obtained biopsies from
patients with a variety of lymphomas and performed
magnetic separation of T and B cells as described in
Materials and Methods. Primary cells were then subjected
ex vivo to apoptotic stimuli, including the commonly
used chemotherapeutic agents etoposide (1-10µM),
daunorubicin (0.2-0.8µg/ml), vincristine (1-10µM), the
death receptor ligand TRAIL (50-200ng/ml), as well as
experimental small molecule compounds LY30 (2550µM) [15], C1 (25-100µg/ml) [16, 17], MPO (1-10µM)
[18], and MPO-Zn (100-400nM). As an internal control,
two established cell lines, Raji and Jurkat, were used in
parallel. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay
following 24 h of incubation with the various compounds.
Results show that primary cells from benign lymphomas
or non-cancerous lymphoid hyperplasia were relatively
insensitive to most drugs, while B cell lymphomas
(BL Cells) in general were resistant to commonly used
chemotherapeutic agents compared to T cell lymphomas
(Figure 1a). This is in agreement with our earlier findings
indicating B-cell lymphoma-derived cell lines were
resistant to etoposide and other chemotherapeutic drugs.
Interestingly, we provide evidence that primary BL cells
were relatively more responsive to the experimental small
molecules MPO[18], MPO-Zn (MPO analogue) and C1
[16, 17] (Figure 1b). We also tested the sensitivity of
primary BL cells to the death receptor ligand TRAIL.
TRAIL has been under clinical evaluation against because
of its ability to selectively target cancer cells [19]. Firstly,
primary BL cells, unlike TL cells, were not responsive to
TRAIL, however pre-incubation of cells with the small
molecule experimental compounds MPO, MPO-Zn, C1
or LY30 resulted in a significant amplification of TRAIL
sensitivity (data not shown).

Absence of Apaf-1 in the cytoplasm of primary BL
cells
The aforementioned results provided evidence
that clinical B cell lymphomas in general were relatively
refractory to known chemotherapeutic agents, but did
possess the functional armory to elicit an apoptotic
response depending on the nature of the stimulus.
Intrigued by these findings and based on our earlier report

using established cell line [14], we set out to investigate
the role of the apoptosome machinery in the resistance
of primary BL cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Primary
cells derived from 30 B-cell lymphoma patients, 7 T-cell
lymphoma patients and 5 benign tumors were used for
the assessment of Apaf-1 expression and its localization.
Interestingly, Apaf-1 expression was detected in the
S100 cytosolic fractions from primary TL cells as well
as Jurkat cell line, however, the expression was virtually
completely absent in the S100 cytosol but found mostly in
the S100 pellet fractions of primary BL cells (Figure 1c,
Supplementary Figure1a, b and c).

central execution signal downstream of mitochondriaderived death signals, its efficient assembly is imperative
for an effective response against drug-induced apoptosis,
which invariably involves the intrinsic death pathway.
Therefore, we next asked if the resistance of primary
BL cells was a function of the lack of cytosolic Apaf-1
expression. To address this, we first made use of our data
indicating the ability of the small molecule experimental
compounds to induce apoptosis in primary BL cells.
Firstly, S-100 cytosol from primary BL cells treated for
1h with MPO (5µM), MPO-Zn (200µM), LY30 (25µM)
and NaN3 (5µg/ml) resulted in a significant increase in
cell-free caspase 3 activity, indicating efficient apoptosis
induction (Figure 2a). Furthermore, while Apaf-1
expression was localized to the S100 pellets of primary
BL cells, exposure of the cells to the novel small molecule
compounds resulted in the redistribution of Apaf-1 to the
S100 cytosols (Figure 2b). Of note, caspase 3 activity was
also induced in S100 cytosol following treatment of the
cells with the cholesterol lowering compound methyl betacyclodextrin (MCD; 200µM), also known for its ability

Disruption of Apaf-1 from S-100 pellet increases
caspase-3 activity
Apaf-1 is an essential adaptor protein required for
the assembly of the apoptosome, which brings about the
activation of downstream caspases, such as caspase 9 and
caspase 3, and apoptosis [20]. As the apoptosome is the

(100ng/ml) for 24 hrs. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. One way ANOVA multiple comparisons analysis was used for
statistical significance (* p < 0.1, **p < 0.001, #p < 0.5, ****p < 0.0001) c. S-100 cytosolic and pellet fractions of primary cells from B-cell
and T-cell lymphomas as well as from Raji and Jurkat cell lines were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF and Apaf-1 was detected
by immunoblotting using anti-Apaf-1. Membranes were probed with anti-β-actin and anti-VDAC-1 as loading controls for cytosolic and
pellet fractions, respectively.

to disrupt membrane lipid raft structures (Figure 2a). To
provide conclusive evidence that the cell free system
did, indeed, work as expected, we performed additional
experiments using the same set of conditions with Raji
cells. Results clearly showed minimal caspase 3 activity in
the absence of dATP and its robust induction upon addition
of dATP (Figure 2c). This was further corroborated by the
appearance of Apaf-1 in the cytsolic fractions (Figure
2d). Furthermore, we performed an additional experiment
using one of the compounds (MPO) that triggered the
relocalization of Apaf-1 to the cytosol in combination with
known inducers of apoptosis, etoposide and daunorubicin.
Of note, while single agent treatment with etoposide or
daunorubicin failed to induce caspase 3 activity in the cellfree model, the presence of MPO significantly enhanced
sensitivity to both the agents (300% increase in caspase

3 activity as well as increased Apaf-1 release in cytosol
(Figure 2e, 2f). These data provide strong evidence that
the small molecule compounds facilitate the release of
Apaf-1 with the resultant increase in caspase 3 activity.

Aberrant localization of Apaf-1 in the lipid raft
fractions of primary BL cells
Based on the findings that small moleculeinduced sensitization of primary BL cells was linked
to the release of Apaf-1 from the membrane fractions
to the S100 fractions and our previous study linking
apoptosis resistance in B cell lymphoma cell lines to
membrane sequestration of Apaf-1 [14], we next assessed
the role of the membrane lipid rafts in the resistance

of primary BL cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Lipid
raft are the cholesterol containing domains within the
plasma membrane [21], and the data presented above
with the cholesterol lowering compound, MCD, pointed
to the possible involvement of the lipid raft domains
in the mislocalization of Apaf-1 in primary BL cells.
Therefore, membrane fractions were obtained using
density gradient centrifugation and subjected to SDSPAGE analysis. Interestingly, in the Raji B cell line, Apaf1 was mostly co-localized with flotillin, which served
as the positive control for lipid raft residing proteins
(Figure 3a). This was distinctly different from the Jurkat
T cell line, where Apaf-1 appeared in the higher cytosolic
fractions. Furthermore, treatment with MCD, the lipid
raft dissociating agent, resulted in the disruption of the

lipid rafts and movement of Apaf-1 to the non-lipid raft
fractions of the plasma membrane (Figure 3a). Similar
to the effect of MCD, results also provide evidence
that the sensitization to apoptosis upon exposure to the
small molecule experimental compounds (MPO, MPOZn, C1 and LY30) was also linked to the ability of these
compounds to disrupt Apaf-1 from the membrane lipid raft
fractions to facilitate efficient assembly and activation of
the apoptosome.
Next we assessed whether the mislocalization
observed in B cell line Raji was, indeed, a mechanism
operative in primary BL cells obtained from patientderived tissue biopsies. Indeed, results obtained on
primary BL cells from 10 patient biopsies revealed
that Apaf-1 was sequestered in the lipid raft fractions

Figure 3: Apaf-1 is sequestered in the lipid raft fractions of Raji cells and primary BL cells. a. Lipid raft fractions were

prepared from Jurkat and Raji cells as described in Material and Methods. Raji cells were treated with MCD (200µM), MPO (5µM), C1
(50µg/ml) and LY30 (25µM) for 1hr before processing for lipid raft fractions. Apaf-1 expression was assessed in the different raft fractions
by western blotting. Flotillin was used as a positive control for lipid raft fractions. b. Cholesterol content was determined in each lipid raft
fraction according to manufacturer’s instructions as described in Materials and Methods. c. Lipid raft fractions were prepared from primary
cells derived from B-cell lymphoma and reactive lymphadenitis, as described in Material and Methods. Primary BL cells were treated with
MPO (5µM), C1 (50µg/ml), or LY30 (25µM) for 1hr before processing for lipid raft fractions. Apaf-1 expression was checked in all the
raft fractions by Western blotting, Caveolin was used as a positive control for lipid raft fractions. d. For reactive lymphadenitis, Apaf-1 was
assessed in all raft fractions by western blotting. Flotillin was used as a positive control for lipid raft fractions. e. S-100 cytosol and pellets
were prepared from primary cells from reactive lymphadenitis and Apaf-1 expression was detected by Western blotting.

and that treatment of the cells with the small molecule
experimental compounds MPO (5µM), LY30 (25µM),
C1 (50µg/ml) for 1hr, resulted in a significant decrease
in the localization of Apaf-1 to the lipid raft fractions
(Figure 3c, Supplementary Figure 2). To verify that
sequestration of Apaf-1 was specifically limited to
B-cell lymphomas, biopsies from patients with noncancerous reactive lymphadenopathy were used. Notably,
Apaf-1 was not associated with the lipid raft fractions
(Figure 3d) but expressed in the S100 cytosol fractions
(Figure 3e) in cells derived from non-cancerous lesions.
Furthermore, we determined the cholesterol content of
the fractions to validate the identity of the fractions, given
the observations that these sub-domains are enriched in
sphingolipids and cholesterol [22]. Indeed, fractions 3, 4
and 5 that are indicative of lipid raft fractions did show the
highest level of cholesterol (Figure 3b). To further validate
these findings, the same patient material was subjected
to immunohistochemistry for the expression of Apaf-1.
Indeed, Apaf-1 co-localized with the lipid raft marker
protein caveolin (Figure 4), thereby corroborating the data
presented in the preceding sections. Taken together, Apaf1 mislocalization to lipid raft domains is a critical factor
in apoptosis resistance in clinical B-cell lymphomas and
strategies to disrupt these cholesterol-rich domains appear
to restore death sensitivity.

C1 and LY30 to dislodge Apaf-1 from the lipid rafts
was a function of intracellular ROS production. Indeed,
exposure of Raji B cells to C1 (50µg/ml) or LY30 (25µM)
resulted in a significant increase in intracellular ROS
production measured by the change in DCF oxidation
(Figure 5a). Furthermore, pre-incubation with 3000
Units of catalase significantly attenuated the increase
in fluorescence, thereby indicating the involvement of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). More importantly, both C1
and LY30 induced a change in the localization of Apaf1 in the membrane fractions (fraction 5 as compared to
fractions 4 and 5 that co-localize with flotillin), which
was reversed upon a priori treatment with catalase
(Figure 5b), further supporting the involvement of H2O2.
Interestingly, not only has H2O2 been directly implicated
in lipid peroxidation [24], but also ROS-induced lipid
peroxidation has been linked to the modification of
membrane lipid rafts [25]. Indeed, we provide evidence
that treatment with the ROS producing compound C1 (25
and 50µg/ml for 15-60 minutes) resulted in an increase
in membrane lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by
the H2O2 scavenger catalase (Figure 5c). Taken together,
these data indicate that ROS generating agents could serve
as an excellent tool for the re-localization of Apaf-1 to the
cytosol in B cell lymphomas that are rendered refractory
to apoptosis due to the membrane sequestration of this
essential adaptor protein
Next, we undertook expression profiling to
identify specific gene signatures and/or gene marker(s)
differentially expressed in lymphomas with membrane
localized Apaf-1. To check gene expression, RNA was
extracted from same patients’ biopsies and analyses were
performed. Briefly, 186 probe sets were differentially
expression by 2 fold between samples with membrane
APAF1 and those with cytosolic APAF1. 132 probe sets
were over-expressed and 64 under-expressed. Only probe
sets of coding genes and those that are differentially
expressed, also at a significance of p<0.05, are represented
on the heat map (Figure 6a). Interestingly, BCL11A was
amongst the genes over-expressed in the samples with

Small molecule induced re-localization of Apaf-1
to the cytosol is ROS dependent
We were intrigued by the ability of the small
molecule experimental compounds to not only dislodge
Apaf-1 from the membrane lipid raft-like structures, but
also to restore the sensitivity to apoptosis. Two of the
molecules (LY30 and C1) have been previously reported
by our group to target tumor cells via mechanisms
involving an increase in intracellular ROS [15-17, 23].
As ROS have been linked to membrane lipid peroxidation
and disruption of lipid rafts, we asked if the ability of

membrane APAF1. The expression of BCL11A was
further validated at the protein level by western blot in
the same patient’s biopsy material (Figure 6b). These data,
albeit with a small number of samples, point to a possible
correlation between membrane localization of Apaf-1 and
BCL11A overexpression [26, 27], which could serve as
novel indicator of drug resistance or poor prognosis in B
cell lymphomas.

MOMP [2], the major focus in terms of the acquisition
of drug resistance in the clinical setting has been on the
anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl2 and Bcl-xL [28]. However, there is also accumulating
evidence that a defect in post-MOMP signaling stalls
death execution and contributes to the development
of the resistant phenotype [3, 29]. In this regard, we
previously reported a novel mechanism for the defective
apoptosis signaling in the human B cell line, Raji, whereby
defective apoptosome formation due to the absence of
cytosolic Apaf-1 was identified as a critical factor [14].
In the present study, we provide clinical evidence that
mislocalization of Apaf-1 may represent an important
prognostic factor in the therapeutic management of
DLBCL.
Apaf-1 is an essential adaptor protein, which serves

DISCUSSION
DLBCL is the most common type of B-cell
lymphoma that exhibits drug resistant phenotype and a
high incidence of relapse [1]. As most chemotherapeutic
agents preferentially activate mitochondria-driven death
execution via mechanisms that trigger the induction of

as the scaffold for the recruitment of cytochrome C, procaspase 9, and dATP, to bring about the assembly of
the apoptosome, and activation of downstream caspase
9 activation[4]. In healthy cells, Apaf-1 exists in the
cytosol [30] as a monomer in a complex with dATP/
ATP, a conformation that prevents its oligomerization and
downstream recruitment of pro-caspase 9. Interestingly,
loss of Apaf-1 has been reported in a variety of human
cancers, such as melanoma, leukemia, ovarian carcinoma,
bladder carcinoma and glioblastoma [8, 10, 13, 31].
Similarly, the development of resistance to death receptorand drug-induced apoptosis in colon carcinoma was
associated with downregulation of Apaf-1 [32]. Our results
not only corroborate the critical importance of functional
Apaf-1 in DLBCL, but also provide a novel mechanism for
its loss of function. While the overall expression of Apaf-1
did not change in the clinical lymphomas we examined,

the sub-cellular localization was significantly altered such
that the protein was sequestered in lipid raft domains
of the plasma membrane instead of being expressed in
the cytosol. The importance of this mislocalization in
the context of apoptosis resistance (ex vivo) was further
corroborated by results demonstrating the restoration of
caspase 3 cleavage/activation upon cytosolic redistribution
of Apaf-1.
Lipid rafts are cholesterol-rich structural domains
within the plasma membrane, which contain diverse
protein and lipid components. Interestingly, membrane
rafts are actively involved in the maintenance and
regulation of signal transduction, as a number of essential
signaling proteins have been shown to localize to these
sub-domains, such as recruitment of receptors and/
or their ligands to the rafts to facilitate intracellular
signaling [22]. By the same token rafts could interfere

or block cell signaling by sequestering proteins away
from a specific signaling network. Of note, membrane
rafts have been shown to play an important role in the
activation and regulation of B cell receptor-mediated
signaling [33]. Furthermore, critical components of
B cell receptor signaling are absent from lipid rafts in
certain disease states involving B cells, such as the EBV
proteins LMP-1 and LMP-2A. While LMP-1 is involved
in the sustained proliferative signal downstream of B
cell receptor activation [34], LMP-2A sequesters Syk
and Lyn tyrosine kinases away from the B cell receptor
to block signal transduction [35]. These data seem to
imply that recruitment to the lipid raft domains may not
be exclusively restricted to membrane proteins or proteins
with lipid-anchoring moieties. Such appears to be the case
with Apaf-1, a predominantly cytosolic protein, but shown
here to be sequestered in lipid raft fractions of DLBCL
cells, thereby creating a non-permissive environment
for apoptosome assembly and activation. The critical
importance of this mislocalization of Apaf-1 in the overall
biology of DLBCL is further supported by our results
demonstrating the ability of small molecules that disrupt
raft-like domains via their effect on cholesterol (MCD)
or lipid peroxidation via ROS production (Ly30 and C1);
however, the precise mechanism underlying the lipid raft
recruitment of Apaf-1 is still the focus of our ongoing
investigations. One could conjecture the possibility of an
interaction of Apaf-1 with lipid raft-associated proteins,
such as the receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, which is
used as a prognostic marker for DLBCL [36]. Moreover,
as EBV infection is a frequent finding in patients with B
cell lymphoma [37], the possibility of viral proteins, such
as LMP1, hijacking Apaf-1 to the lipid fractions cannot
be completely ruled out. Similarly, the existence of an
interaction between the WD40 domain within Apaf-1 [38]
and membrane associated cytoskeleton protein(s) could be
another plausible scenario. Furthermore, gene expression
data also point to an interesting association between
membrane-anchored Apaf-1 and overexpression of the
Kruppel zinc finger gene, BCL11A. It should be pointed
out that overexpression of BCL11A has previously been
associated with hematopoietic malignancies, either through
its gene amplification or chromosomal translocation [26,
27]. The gene expression data were confirmed at the
protein level; however, these observations need to be
validated in a larger cohort of patients to gain further
insight into the functional relevance of the association
between membrane localized Apaf-1 and BCL11A
expression. Nevertheless, the preliminary association
lends itself to suggest a possible marker of drug resistance
and/or poor prognosis in B cell lymphomas.
One other attractive model proposed earlier by
Kagan et al. surmised that the significant differences
in the membrane composition as well as the levels of
ROS in B-cell lymphomas, compared to their T cell
counterparts, may affect the protein and cholesterol
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trafficking in the cells [39]. Although, we do not have
experimental evidence to suggest differences in the
membrane composition between primary cells derived
from B and T cell lymphomas, results presented with small
molecule experimental compounds appear to support these
observations. Two small molecule experimental agents, C1
[16, 17] and LY30 [15, 23], as well as the mitochondria
electron transport inhibitor NaN3 that trigger intracellular
ROS production had a profound influence on cell-free
caspase 3 activity as a result of the re-localization of Apaf1 to the cytosol. To that end, redox-dependent alterations
of lipid moieties could disrupt lipid raft structures thereby
facilitating the release of sequestered Apaf-1. This is
supported, at least in part, by the inhibitory effect of
scavenging intracellular H2O2 with catalase. Collectively,
these data suggest a novel mechanism for reinforcing
apoptososme activation in DLBCL via drug-induced
cytosolic redistribution of the apoptosome scaffold protein,
Apaf-1, which is trapped in membrane raft sub-domains in
refractory DLBCL.

CONCLUDING REMARKS:
Primary cells derived from patients with DLBCL
show membrane raft sequestration of the apoptosome
adaptor protein, Apaf-1. As Apaf-1 expression is critical
for post-mitochondrial death execution, these data provide
a novel mechanism of the refractory and aggressive nature
of this sub-class of B cell lymphomas. Recent efforts have
been geared at identifying novel agents that facilitate the
robust assembly of apoptosome components and the major
focus has been on compounds that promote the egress
of cytochrome C, an essential apoptosome protein. Our
data provide a novel strategy whereby the redistribution
of Apaf-1 to the cytosol via drugs that act on lipid raft
sub-domains through distinct mechanisms, including
alterations in intracellular redox milieu, could create a
favorable environment for apoptosome activation and
death execution with potential therapeutic implications
for the management of refractory DLBCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary lymphoma cells and cancer cell lines
Tissue biopsies from lymphoma patients were
obtained from National University Hospital (NUHS)
of Singapore after obtaining proper informed consent
from the patients. Tissues were minced and strained
using MACS separation filter (Milteny Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to obtain a singlecell suspension. Few samples were sorted out using
CD22 and CD8 antibodies by magnetic cell sorting
according to manufacturer’s protocol (Milteney Biotec,
83972

Oncotarget

Western blot analysis

Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Mononuclear cells and/
or lymphocytes’ enrichment was performed by Ficoll
Hypaque (Sigma, St Louis, MO) gradient centrifugation. A
total of 58 tissue biopsies were obtained from consenting
patients (37 B cell lymphomas, 9 T cell lymphomas and
12 benign tumors) and used in this study. For in vitro
validation, Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma) and Jurkat (T-cell
Lymphoma) human cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1%
penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified incubator with
5% CO2.

S-100 cytosol and pellet fractions or lipid raft
fractions were denatured in loading buffer and resolved
on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by transfer to
PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with
antibodies against Apaf-1 (Chemicon, CA), β-actin, Bcl2, Bcl-xl, VDAC-1 (Santa-Cruz, Dallas, TX), BCL11A,
caveolin and flotillin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and then
probed with the isotype specific secondary IgG-HRP as
required. Membranes were then exposed to Super Signal
Substrate Western Blotting Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA).

Determination of cell viability
Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay
after exposure of 2×105 primary lymphocytes/200µl/
well in 96 well plates to etoposide (5µM), daunorubicin
(0.4µg/ml), vincristine (5µM) (Sigma, St Louis, MO),
mercaptopyridine oxide (MPO; 2.5µM), MPO-Zn
(200nM), C1 (50µg/ml), LY303511 (Calbiochem,
Billerica, MA) (LY30; 50µM) and TRAIL (100ng/ml) for
24 hrs. MTT assay was performed as described previously
[40]. To evaluate the ability of the small molecule
compounds to sensitize to death receptor-induced
apoptosis, 2×105 primary lymphocytes/200µl/well in 96
well plates were pretreated for 1hr with MPO (0.625µM),
MPO-Zn (50nM), C1 (25µg/ml) or LY30 (25µM) prior
to the addition of TRAIL (50ng/ml) for 24hrs and cell
viability was determined by the MTT assay.

Purification of membrane lipid raft fraction
For lipid raft extraction, 40×106 cells (primary
lymphocytes, Raji or Jurkat) were incubated in icecold HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 minutes. Cells were
disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer followed by
sonication and the lysates were centrifuged at 1000g for 10
minutes at 4oC. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto
a gradient of 80%, 30%, and 5% sucrose and centrifuged
at 38000 RPM for 21 hours at 4oC. 500ul of the fraction
was collected from the top and stored at -800 or used
immediately. Fractions were used for the determination of
cholesterol content using the cholesterol quantitation kit
(Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) following the manufacturers
recommended protocol, as well as subjected to SDS-PAGE
for western blot analysis of membrane proteins.

Assessment of cell-free caspase-3 activity

Determination of intracellular ROS and lipid
peroxidation

For S-100 cytosolic extraction, 30×106 cells
(primary lymphocytes, Raji or Jurkat) were incubated with
ice-cold S-100 buffer (20mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.5,
10mM KCL, 1.5mM MgCl2, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA,
1mM DTT supplemented with protease inhibitors and
phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Cells were
disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer and the pellet was
centrifuged at 1000g for 10 minutes at 40C. Supernatants
were further centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 hr, and the
resulting supernatant (S-100 cytosol) was stored at -80oC
or used immediately. The S-100 pellet was dissolved
in 1X RIPA lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors and stored at -800C or used immediately. For
cell free caspase-3 activation, S-100 cytosol (120µg)
from cells treated with MPO (5µM), MPO-Zn (200µM),
LY30 (25µM), NaN3 (5µg/ml), etoposide (5µΜ) or
daundorubicin (0.5µl/µl) were incubated in the presence
or absence of 1mM dATP and 4µM cytochrome C (Sigma,
St Louis, MO) for 30min at 370C. Caspase-3 activity was
then measured by using fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AFC
as described previously [40].

2×106 primary lymphocytes or Raji cells were
treated with or without C1 (25 and 50µg/ml) or LY30
(25 and 50µM) for 15, 30 and 60minutes. Cells were
incubated with catalase (3000U/ml) one hour prior to
the addition of the drugs and cellular ROS content was
measured by loading cells with DCHF-DA (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously [23]. For the
assessment of lipid peroxidation, samples were incubated
with cis-perinaric acid (10µM) (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for
1hr at 37oC, and a change in the fluorescence emission at
418nm following excitation at 324nm was used to indicate
an increase in lipid peroxidation.
