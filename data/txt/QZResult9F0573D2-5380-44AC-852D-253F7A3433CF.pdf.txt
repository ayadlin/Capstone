Abstract

Biological Activities of HEF1 that Favor Metastasis

Greater understanding of metastasis is required to improve
cancer treatment outcomes. Recently, changes in expression of
the scaffold protein HEF1/CAS-L/NEDD9 were found to be a
potent prometastatic stimulus in melanoma and other cancers. Mechanistic studies suggest diverse cellular roles of HEF1
and highlight its importance in the response to extracellular
cues that drive invasion and metastasis. As a metastatic ‘‘hub’’
for signaling in cancer, HEF1 may provide a useful target for
drug discovery efforts. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):8975–9]

The HEF1 gene is conserved in all vertebrates and localizes
at chromosome 6p25-24 in humans and chromosome 13 A3.3 in
mice. The HEF1 protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, concentrating at focal adhesions during interphase in adherent cells and
at centrosomes and other parts of the mitotic apparatus during G2M. HEF1 lacks any known enzymatic function but contains many
functional modules for protein interaction, leading to its classification as a scaffolding protein (2, 3, 7, 8). Validated interaction
sequences include (Fig. 1A ) an SH3 domain, at least
15 SH2 domain-binding sites, and an evolutionarily well-conserved
carboxy-terminal domain of unknown structure. Proteins that
functionally and/or physically interact with HEF1 (Fig. 1B and C)
include many with direct roles in promoting tumor invasion, as
discussed below. Vertebrate HEF1 has two paralogues, p130Cas/
BCAR1 and Efs/Sin, which conserve domain structure and many,
but not, all functional interactions (6, 8): together, HEF1, p130Cas,
and Efs are called members of the Cas family.
Significantly elevated levels of HEF1 mRNA (10-fold to 70-fold)
and protein exist in >35% of the metastatic melanomas produced
by ‘‘escaper’’ tumors in Tyr rtTA+;Tet RAS+;Ink4a/Arf / mutant
mice, as well as in a similar percentage of human metastatic
melanomas (5). Importantly, elevated HEF1 protein expression was
essential for the metastatic properties of the involved tumors both
in vitro and in vivo (5). As HEF1 is a scaffolding protein, its action
involves regulated assembly of protein complexes. Consequently,
the effect of altered HEF1 expression is dependent on the relative
stoichiometry and availability of other complex constituents.
Hence, moderate overexpression may drive the assembly of functional complexes, causing constitutive activation of downstream
effector pathways. Conversely, excessive HEF1 overexpression may
be equivalent to loss of HEF1 expression, if either condition induces complex disruption. It is perhaps significant that one study
has identified reduced HEF1 expression as part of a signature for
metastatic breast cancers (discussed further below; ref. 9). Further,
both overexpression and depletion of HEF1 cause mitotic defects in
cultured cells (10, 11). Whereas the exact mechanism of HEF1
action in metastasis requires further investigation, to date, studies
of HEF1 overexpression, depletion, and genetic deletion have
revealed the following metastasis-relevant properties.
(a) HEF1 positively regulates the Src-FAK-Crk ‘‘migratory
switch.’’ The initial reports identifying HEF1 established that
this protein interacts directly with FAK, Src, and Crk (2, 3). FAK is
commonly constitutively activated in melanomas and an important
target of cancer drug development. The consensus of work by
many groups suggests a mechanism in which cell attachment
triggers the interaction of Src, HEF1, and FAK: overexpression or
mutational activation of one of these proteins can also drive
complex formation. These interactions enhance the activation of
Src and FAK and lead to extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of
HEF1, creating binding sites for effector proteins with SH2

Introduction
In recent years, our understanding of the metastatic process has
evolved significantly. It is now appreciated that the formation of
distant metastases requires functionally distinct events, including
(a) invasion of a tumor through basement membrane and stroma,
(b) tumor cell intravasation, (c) survival of a tumor in the blood
stream, (d) homing of the tumor to a specific site ( frequently,
although not invariably), and (e) extravasation and colony formation. This complexity implies either that the combined action of
multiple proteins is necessary for metastasis, or that proteins
which can promote metastasis are multifunctional.
The identification of tumor-encoded genes, whose elevated
expression marks transition to metastasis and which are required
for establishment of tumors at distant sites, will yield important
diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. Many research groups have
sought to define such genes, and in the past year, signaling activity
and overexpression of HEF1/Cas-L/NEDD9 (hereafter designated
HEF1; refs. 1–3) has been shown to be required for invasion by
glioblastomas (4) and strongly linked to promotion of melanoma
metastasis (5). Significantly, extensive characterization of HEF1
over the past decade has revealed a multifaceted mode of action
that suggests changes in HEF1 status may be fundamentally
important for multiple aspects of the metastatic program. In this
review, we will first discuss the signaling activities that most likely
underlie the ability of HEF1 to influence metastasis and then
outline the cellular mechanisms influencing HEF1 expression and
‘‘activation’’ during metastatic transition. Finally, we will discuss
intriguing recent findings that imply a broader role for HEF1 in the
pathogenesis of aggressive nonsolid tumors and strategies for
therapeutically targeting HEF1. We note that roles for HEF1 in
additional cellular processes and diseases have recently been
comprehensively reviewed (6, 7).

domains, the most important of which are Crk and Crk-L. A CasCrk complex has been described as a ‘‘master switch’’ for cell
migration; through Crk-L and DOCK180, HEF1 activates Rac and
other components of the cell migration machinery (reviewed in
ref. 8).

degrade or remodel basement membranes to allow cellular movement while activating latent growth factors that promote tumor
progression. Related to this, HEF1 overexpression may induce
molecules involved in tissue remodeling and invasion (12). HEF1
overexpression also induces the activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) kinases
through interactions with intermediary signaling effectors (reviewed in ref. 6). For example, overexpressed HEF1 transcriptionally induces ErbB2/HER2/neu, a growth factor receptor at the top
of the Ras > Raf > MAP/ERK kinase > ERK pathway, whereas the
HEF1 interactor FAK directly binds SHC, which influences
activation of Ras through its binding partners, epidermal growth
factor receptor and growth factor receptor binding protein 2.
HEF1 also binds proteins of the AND-34/CHAT family (13),
which activate JNK and ERK by signaling through Rap1 (14).
Activated Rap1 is also an important intermediate in ‘‘inside-out’’
cell signaling, in which internally derived signals activate integrinligand binding in response to upstream cues that typically involve
chemokine stimulation. This process, much studied in consideration of the migration and ‘‘homing’’ of lymphoid cells, is now
appreciated as playing a role in tumor invasion and targeting of
metastases. Lymphoid cells from HEF1 null mice, or with depleted
HEF1, are greatly impaired for chemokine response, migration,
and homing, accompanied by failed activation of CHAT-H and
Rap1 (14, 15). Critically, these defects involve the CXCR4-CXCL12
targeting system, which is important not only for targeting of
lymphocytes to secondary organs, but is also a major contributor
to tumor metastasis (16). By inference, CXCR4 signaling is expected
to be hyperactivated in cells with overexpressed HEF1.
(c) HEF1 conditions transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h)
responses. One of the enigmas of tumor progression is how tumor
interpretation of TGF-h signals modulates over time. Extrinsic
TGF-h inhibits the growth of early tumors; however, TGF-h promotes
the growth of later stage invasive tumors (17), down-regulating Ecadherin and promoting mesenchymal transformation. Intriguingly,
HEF1 binds directly to TGF-h pathway effectors and inhibitors,
including multiple SMADs (e.g., ref. 18 and discussed in ref. 6).
Via these interactions, HEF1 induces negative feedback for aspects
of TGF-h–dependent signaling. Intriguingly, the TGF-h pathway
signaling molecule SMAD7 has very recently been shown to inhibit
melanoma metastasis to bone (19); HEF1 overexpression would be
predicted to limit SMAD7 activity, thus promoting metastasis.
(d) HEF1 activates RhoA and Aurora A, providing early counter
pressures for tumor growth. Given the extensive biology linking
HEF1 to invasion signaling pathways, recent observations that this
protein also regulates cell cycle progression through mitosis were

unexpected (6, 10, 11). In MCF-7 cells and other epithelial cell lines,
HEF1 functions at two discrete points during cytokinesis.
At the centrosome, HEF1 interacts with and activates Aurora A
kinase during mitotic entry. Overexpressed HEF1 hyperactivates
Aurora A, inducing failure of cytokinesis. Separately, HEF1 positively regulates RhoA activation, and elevated HEF1 expression
leads to abnormally persistent RhoA activity throughout cytokinesis, preventing normal cellular reattachment to surrounding matrix
and providing a second stimulus for deficient cytokinesis. HEF1overexpressing cells exhibiting defective cytokinesis then arrest
in G1 and subsequently undergo apoptosis at high frequency,
implying the triggering of cell division checkpoints.
The recognition that HEF1 overexpression triggers cell division
checkpoints and apoptosis may be particularly important in understanding why HEF1 overexpression is associated with later (rather
than early) stages of tumor progression. In the Tyr rtTA+;TetRAS+;Ink4a/Arf / melanoma mouse model, both Rb-dependent
and p53-dependent cell division checkpoints have been disabled,
and concurrently, constitutive Ras overexpression provides a strong
stimulus toward continued proliferation. Such prior changes may
be essential for cells to tolerate proapoptotic effects of sustained
HEF1 overexpression. In this context, it is interesting that metastatic melanomas are often characterized by genomic rearrangements
and aneuploidy and manifest a high level of apoptosis relative to
premetastatic tumors.
(e) HEF1 and Aurora A regulate ciliary disassembly. Cilia are small
organelles that protrude from the surface of many mammalian cell
types and act as cellular ‘‘antennas,’’ with growth factor receptors
localized at cilia sensing extracellular cues to regulate cell growth.
Defects in ciliary structural integrity or associated signaling induce
numerous developmental syndromes, are a primary cause of
polycystic kidney disease, and have been, in the past year, strongly
linked to cancer development (reviewed in ref. 20). Very recently,
HEF1 activation of Aurora A at the ciliary basal body was shown to
trigger a ciliary resorption pathway involving the tubulin deacetylase
HDAC6 as an effector protein (21). This unexpected finding suggests
a totally new mechanism by which overexpression of HEF1 can
influence the growth properties of metastatic cancers: much more
work is necessary to understand the importance of this observation.

What Causes HEF1 Up-regulation before Melanoma
Metastasis?
In normal and transformed cells, HEF1 is dynamically regulated
in response to both intracellular and extracellular signals.
Molecular mechanisms important for control of HEF1 expression

Figure 1. A, schematic of the structure of the HEF1/NEDD9/CasL protein. Human HEF1 is 834 amino acids; key functional domains include an amino terminal SH3
domains which binds FAK, a ‘‘substrate domain’’ (SD ) containing multiple embedded SH2 binding sites analogous to the mechanosensing domain of p130Cas
recently described by Sawada et al., a likely four-helix bundle based on molecular modeling of primary sequence of HEF1 against the crystal coordinates for the
conserved region of p130Cas (results not shown), and an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal domain which binds Src family kinases and other proteins (indicated
with a ‘‘?’’ as details of structure remain unknown). B, HEF1 (bright yellow , with ‘‘H’’) is a component of the integrin-dependent Src-FAK-Crk migration signaling cascade,
influences cellular homing through CHAT/CXCR4, engages in crosstalk with the Ras pathway, is an intermediate in TGF-h–dependent signaling, activates the
centrosomal Aurora-A/Ajuba/TPX2 machinery governing mitotic entry and cytokinesis, and activates Aurora-A/HDAC6 at the basal body to initiate ciliary disassembly.
C, curated online resources (based on experimentally well-validated protein interaction data) indicate numerous direct HEF1 interactions with cancer-related
signaling pathways. Blue lines, protein interactions; many HEF1 partners also take part in extensive self-interactions within functional clusters that are likely
augmented by increased HEF1 levels. Clusters are particularly relevant to FAK/Src/integrin (rose ), CHAT/Rap1 (green ), Aurora A (blue ), TGF-h/SMADs (gold ),
and all others (yellow ). All HEF1-only interactions present in online databases (blue lines) and common interactions of HEF1 and BCAR1/p130Cas (dashed pink lines ,
for contrast) are distinguished; interactions between all other proteins, including functional and physical interactions (green ). For clarity, only interactions relevant to
the discussion in this review are shown. Data on protein-protein interactions were collected in Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/), combining data from a Bionet
plug-in (http://err.bio.nyu.edu/cytoscape/bionetbuilder/), and EMBL String (string.embl.de/), with each retrieving information from several databases, including DIP

and scaffolding function include transcriptional activation, phosphorylation, and both proteasome-mediated and caspase-mediated
proteolysis (reviewed in detail in ref. 6). Although up-regulation of
the HEF1 mRNA in metastasis has been shown in some cases to
arise from chromosomal amplification (5), this up-regulation more
commonly occurs at the level of mRNA transcription. Given that
the HEF1 mRNA is down-regulated during nervous system development (ref. 1 and discussed in ref. 6), it is interesting to speculate
that HEF1 overexpression in melanoma may reflect aberrant reactivation of a developmental program.
A growing number of transcriptional pathways have been
reported to regulate HEF1; intriguingly, some of these are
particularly relevant to metastasis. For example, hypoxia is now
appreciated as creating conditions conducive for metastasis, and
hypoxia is emerging as a potentially important inducer of HEF1
mRNA expression (22, 23). TGF-h strongly induces transcription of
HEF1 (24); together with the role for HEF1 in negative regulation
of TGF-h signaling, this provides a second link between these
proteins and raises the possibility of a reinforcing feedback loop.
HEF1 mRNA and protein are strongly induced by serum treatment,
but as yet, most of the serum factors directing transcription of the
HEF1 are poorly understood.
It is extremely likely that posttranscriptional events will be found
to modulate the expression and action of HEF1 in aggressive
cancers. Phosphorylation not only regulates HEF1 scaffolding
capacity but can also regulate HEF1 protein turnover. HEF1
phosphorylation is induced by a number of key factors linked
with cancer progression, including FAK (commonly activated in
advanced melanomas), TGF-h (24), platelet-derived growth factor
(4), Abl (2), and BCR-ABL (25). This last observation is of particular
interest as the literature describing a role for HEF1 in hematopoietic malignancies becomes increasingly compelling (ref. 15 and
discussed comprehensively in ref. 7). Conversely, for solid tumors, a
particularly appealing idea is that changes in the cellular
microenvironment, such as the increasing rigidity of stroma
organized around an invasive tumor (26), may directly condition
HEF1 activity. The HEF1 paralogue p130Cas has recently been
recognized as a mechanosensor hyperphosphorylated in response
to stretch (27); HEF1 conserves all the structural elements
necessary for a similar response.

Prospect for Therapeutic Exploitation of HEF1
At present, HEF1 is an attractive biomarker of metastatic
melanomas. Whether this will be true for other cancers remains to
be established; for instance, while HEF1 promotes metastatic

behavior in glioblastomas (4), reduced levels of HEF1 transcript
characterize an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line selected by
serial in vivo passages for efficient metastasis to the lung in mice
(9). This may represent tumor type–specific HEF1 action.
Alternatively, given that the stochiometry of HEF1 and its binding
partners is likely to be critical to the signaling function of HEF1,
it is possible that these data simply reflect an inhibition of
HEF1 function — achieved either by loss of gene product or by
altered protein stochiometry resulting from overexpression. Future
delineation of these different possibilities will be important for
determining HEF1 function in metastatic cancer. No serious
attempt has as yet been made to target HEF1 for drug
development; as a scaffolding protein with no assigned catalytic
function, drug selection strategies are clearly more challenging
than for enzymes. However, several points suggest a HEF1-directed
targeting strategy is feasible. A peptide aptamer screen has
identified discrete peptides that bind and stabilize the HEF1
protein from degradation, implying that it may be possible to
identify agents that destabilize the protein (28). Significantly,
although HEF1 / mice manifest some developmental and
migration defects, these animals are viable and fertile (15),
indicating that loss of HEF1 function can probably be well
tolerated in adults. Drugs targeting FAK, Src, BCR-ABL, and TGFh already in the clinic may be particularly effective in tumors
overexpressing HEF1 through limiting HEF1 phosphorylation.
Finally, early evidence suggests a potential role for HEF1 in
other pathologic conditions, including stroke, rheumatoid arthritis,
and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 infection, as well as
leukemias and lymphomas (reviewed in refs. 6, 7). A decade after its
first description, HEF1 is poised to yield exciting insights into the
process of metastasis and may provide an important new target in
chemotherapy.
