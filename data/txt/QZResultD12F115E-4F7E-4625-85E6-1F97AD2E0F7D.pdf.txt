Abstract
Kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7) is upregulated in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) with high levels
correlated with poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship and the role of KLK7 in
EOC progression are unknown. We report that two different KLK7 transcripts, KLK7-253 and KLK7-181, are
simultaneously expressed in high-grade serous EOC. Multicellular aggregates (MCA), which promote cell survival and chemoresistance, were observed in SKOV-3 cells stably overexpressing KLK7-253 in particular. Importantly, these MCAs invade into a monolayer of mesothelial cells and form cancer cell foci. Blocking MCA
using antibodies against KLK7 and α5β1 and β1 integrins confirmed the involvement of KLK7 and integrinregulated cell adhesion. Increased levels of α5/β1 integrins and enhanced attachment to fibronectin and vitronectin, which was blocked with an anti–β1 integrin antibody, were also observed. Finally, Western blot and
immunohistochemistry showed higher KLK7 and α5/β1 integrin levels in serous EOC cells from ascites and
tumor samples from chemotherapy nonresponders with short postsurvival times. Additionally, both KLK7253 and KLK7-181 clones were more resistant to paclitaxel treatment in vitro. These findings suggest a mechanism for the association of high KLK7 levels with chemoresistance and poor prognosis for serous EOC patients by
promotion of peritoneal dissemination and reinvasion via increased MCA and α5β1 integrin–dependent cell
adhesion. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2624–33. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies, with serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma
(EOC) being the predominant subtype. Late diagnosis and
chemoresistance result in a ∼30% 5-year survival rate (1). Unlike other solid tumors, hematogenous metastasis rarely occurs
in ovarian cancer; instead, EOC cells exfoliate from the primary
site, form multicellular aggregates (MCA)/spheroids to aid survival in the peritoneal fluid, adhere to mesothelial cells on the
surface of the peritoneum, invade into the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and grow secondary tumors (2, 3).

Dynamic modulation of cell adhesion molecules, such as
integrins, plays a critical role in remodeling the malignant
ovarian epithelium during peritoneal metastasis (4). Clinically,
high levels of αv (5) and α5 (6) integrins are associated with
poor outcome. Integrin signaling has been related to MCA/
spheroid formation (7) and disaggregation (8) in EOC, and
spheroids formed in three-dimensional suspension are more
resistant to chemotherapy than two-dimensional monolayer
cultured cells (9). Integrins can promote EOC cell dissemination and implantation in the peritoneal cavity via E-cadherin
ectodomain shedding (10), loss of E-cadherin (6), and ECM
protein degradation (11) by matrix metalloproteinases
(MMP). However, the role of other proteases in EOC remains
largely unknown.
The kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family comprises
15 serine proteases, with several members upregulated in
EOC (12–14), including KLK7 (15–20), which is associated
with poor prognosis in EOC patients (17, 18). KLKs degrade
ECM molecules such as fibronectin and cell adhesion proteins contributing to skin desquamation (21) as well as activate growth factors and other proteases (12–14). Two KLK7
transcripts (KLK7-253 and KLK7-181) have been detected in
cancerous but not normal ovarian epithelial (NOE) cells, implying cancer-specific expression (15), although little is known
about their biological function in EOC. We now report that
stable expression of KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 in SKOV-3 cells
promotes paclitaxel resistance and enhances expression of

KLK7, Invasion, and Chemoresistance in Serous Ovarian Cancer

α5/β1 integrins. The KLK7-253 clones, in particular, also form
large compact spheroids, which were blocked by functional
antibodies against KLK7 and α5/β1 integrins and which were
capable of invasion into mesothelial cell monolayers. These
data provide a mechanism for our clinically observed high
KLK7 levels that were associated with chemoresistance and
poor outcome.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (integrins),
R&D Systems (KLK7), and Invitrogen (anti-V5 and anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 488/568–conjugated secondary antibodies). All
other chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where
noted below.
Cell lines and ovarian tissue RNA
Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (serous EOC: SKOV-3, OVCAR3, OV-90, and
Caov-3; fibroblast: NFF1) or Coriell Cell Repositories (peritoneal mesothelial: LP9) with PEO1, PEO4, PEO14, OAW42, JAM,
and CI-80-13S as described previously (15). Other cell lines
were generous gifts from Dr. Nelly Auersperg (University of
British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;
IOSE144, IOSE379, and IOSE7576) and Dr. Samuel Mok (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; HOSE17.1, OVCA420, and
OVCA432). Four normal ovarian, 31 serous EOC tissue (22),
and 7 EOC RNA (15) samples were described previously. Clinical and pathologic information of EOC patients was obtained
from the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital (Supplementary
Table S1). Ethical approval was obtained from institutional
ethics committees, and informed consent was obtained from
all patients.
RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR, and reverse
transcription-quantitative PCR
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), treated
with DNaseI (Invitrogen), and 2 μg RNA reverse transcribed
using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). All KLK7-specific primers
are shown schematically in Fig. 1A, and sequences of all
primers, KLK7 microarray probe, and PCR conditions are
listed in Supplementary Table S2. K75'S and K7Ex3AS were
used to amplify both KLK7-253 (573 bp) and KLK7-181
(442 bp; Fig. 1A). PCR products were sequenced (Australian
Genome Research Facility) to confirm transcript-specific
amplicons (tBLASTN).
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on an ABI 7300
thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green following the manufacturer's instructions. KLK7 expression
was normalized to 18S using the standard curve method.
K7Ex1qS and K7Ex2qAS primers were used to amplify
KLK7-253, whereas both KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 transcripts
(total KLK7) were amplified with K7Ex4qS and K7Ex5qAS
primers (Fig. 1A). The copy number of KLK7-181 was obtained
by subtraction of KLK7-253 from total amplified KLK7. Microarray analysis was performed as previously described (22).

Generation of stable cell lines
KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 constructs are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A. KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 (Fig. 1A) were amplified from OVCAR3 cDNA, subcloned (pcDNA3.1/V5-His,
Invitrogen; COOH-terminal V5 tag), and transfected into
SKOV-3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Monoclonal cells expressing KLK7 or vector control were selected using
G418 (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) was
performed using K7Ex4qS and K7Ex5qAS primers, and products
were sequenced confirming transcript-specific expression.
Immunofluorescent microscopy
Cells were grown on coverslips to ∼80% confluence, fixed
[4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde], blocked [1% (w/v) bovine
serum albumin/PBS], and incubated with anti-V5 antibody
(1:500). Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (Invitrogen) was included
with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG).
Images were taken using a Leica-TCS SP5 confocal microscope
(63× 1.4 oil immersion objective) and associated software.
In vitro functional assays
Proliferation assay. Cells (2 × 103 per well) were seeded in
phenol red–free RPMI 1640/10% (v/v) FCS in 96-well plates
(Nunc) and incubated at 37°C for 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. WST-1
assays were performed per the manufacturer's instructions
(Roche). The 4-h time point was used as “no-proliferation”
control. The assay was performed thrice with eight replicates
per clone per time point.
Cell survival after cisplatin/paclitaxel treatment. Twentyfour hours after seeding, cells were treated with cisplatin
(0, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μmol/L) or paclitaxel (0, 0.01, 1, 10,
and 100 nmol/L). WST-1 assays were performed 72 h after
treatment as above. Cell survival was calculated as percentage of absorbance in nontreated cells.
MCA/spheroid formation and inhibition. Generation of
spheroids and MCA inhibition was based on the liquid overlay
technique (7). Cells (5 × 103 per well) were layered on top of
agarose-coated plates [60 μL of 0.5% (w/v) agarose/serum-free
medium] and incubated at 37°C. For MCA inhibition, cells
were resuspended in serum-free culture medium, and 5 ×
103 cells per well were plated in agarose-coated 96-well plates.
Blocking antibodies (anti-α5β1/β1 integrins and anti-KLK7) or
control mouse IgG was added (10 μg/mL). Cells were cultured
for 2 d and images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U
digital camera (4× objective) and V++ software. The experiment was repeated thrice in quadruplicate.
Cell survival of MCA/spheroids after paclitaxel treatment. Spheroid formation was conducted as described
above. After 4 d of suspension, cultures were treated with
paclitaxel (0, 0.01, 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L), and after 72 h,
alamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added [10% (v/v) final concentration] for 5 h per the manufacturer's instruction. Fluorescence was detected using a BMG PolarStar plate reader. The
assay was performed thrice with triplicates per clone per
concentration. Cell survival was calculated as percentage of
fluorescence in nontreated cells.
Monolayer mesothelial cell invasion. LP9 mesothelial
cells (5 × 103) were seeded in 96-well plates and grown to

680/800–conjugated mouse/rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences).
Images were obtained using the Odyssey (LI-COR Biosciences)
system, and densitometric analyses were performed using
Odyssey software version 2.0.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (15) on paraffin-embedded sections of well-differentiated
and poorly differentiated tumors from seven serous EOC patients
who had responded or not to chemotherapy (ID nos. 7 and 11:
nonresponders, poorly differentiated; ID nos. 28, 31, and 34: responders, poorly differentiated; ID nos. 23 and 37: responders,
well differentiated; Supplementary Table S1). Following antigen retrieval and incubation with antibodies against KLK7
(1:200), α5 or β1 integrin (1:400), or rabbit IgG (negative control; Dako) overnight at 4°C, the EnVision peroxidase system
(Dako) was applied. Sections were counterstained with
Mayer's hematoxylin, visualized using a digital camera (Olympus BX41), and photographed (QCapture Pro 6.0 software).
Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and displayed using CorelDraw.

Results
KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 are highly expressed in serous
EOC cells and tissues
The relative expression levels and cancer specificity (15) of
KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 transcripts were examined using a cohort of normal ovarian tissues (NOT), NOE, and serous EOC
cells. In high-grade (G2 and G3) primary serous EOC cells,
PEO1, PEO4, and OVCAR3 cell lines, two amplicons were observed, with KLK7-253 bands (573 bp) generally more intense
than those of KLK7-181 (442 bp; Fig. 1B). In contrast, no amplicons were detected in NOT, NOE, low-grade (G1), or SKOV-3
cancer cells (Fig. 1B), with β2-microglobulin (β2M) as a loading
control. KLK7 protein was also detected in lysates from three of
four high-grade EOCs, PEO1 (faint bands), and PEO4 cell lines,
but not NOE, low-grade cancer, or SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 1C). The
two bands at approximately 32 to 35 kDa likely represent glycosylated and unglycosylated KLK7-253 (24). No bands were detected at the suspected ∼20 kDa for the KLK7-181 isoform.
RT-qPCR was performed for KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 transcripts using 4 NOE, 11 serous EOC lines, 3 NOT, and 16 serous
EOC tissues. Both KLK7 transcripts are significantly upregulated in EOC cells and tissues compared with NOE and NOT,
respectively (P < 0.001; Fig. 1D, left). These data were supported by microarray analysis, which showed significantly
higher total KLK7 levels in cancerous than normal and benign
ovarian tissues (P < 0.001; Fig. 1D, right).
KLK7-253 cells form MCAs that invade into mesothelial
cell monolayers
MCA formation is thought to be a mechanism for EOC cell
survival in ascites before peritoneal invasion (25, 26). To determine if KLK7 played a role in MCA formation, we generated
stable transfectants of KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 in SKOV-3

cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C; Fig. 2A). Confocal microscopy confirmed protein over-expression in each of the KLK7253 and KLK7-181 (at a lower level) clones, but negligible expression in vector control clones (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig.
S1C). We then compared the ability of KLK7-253 and KLK7181 clones to form spheroids (Fig. 2B). By 2, 4, and 7 days after
seeding, vector controls and native SKOV-3 cells formed small
spheroids compared with the single large compact MCA generated by all three KLK7-253 clones and less compact MCA
formed by one (5D11) KLK7-181 clone (Fig. 2B). The other
two KLK7-181 clones had a similar aggregation pattern to vector controls possibly due to low levels of KLK7-181 expression
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).
We then examined the invasiveness of two representative
MCAs (3E4 and 5D11) when added onto peritoneal mesothelial cell monolayers. As shown by bright-field and fluorescent imaging, both the compact KLK7-253 (3E4) and the less
compact KLK7-181 (5D11) MCAs adhered on top of live mesothelial cell monolayers on the day of seeding and gradually
formed an extensive front of invading cancer cells within 2
to 3 days (Fig. 2C), with the larger 3E4 MCA still spreading
for up to 7 days (data not shown). However, similar migratory
and invasive capacity of both KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 clones
was apparent in two-dimensional Transwell migration and
Matrigel invasion assays compared with vector controls
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Indeed, the attachment of KLK7transfected clones to mesothelial cells did not differ from that
of native SKOV-3 cells or vector controls (Supplementary
Fig. S3B and C), suggesting that the only phenotypic difference induced by KLK7 overexpression was the ability to
form MCAs.
KLK7-181 and KLK7-253 cell attachment to fibronectin/
vitronectin is inhibited by a β1 integrin blocking antibody
To determine how disseminating KLK7-expressing cells invade into the peritoneum, given no difference in their adhesiveness to mesothelial cells (shown above), we examined
their adhesion to ECM proteins from the matrix underlying
mesothelial cell layers. Both KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 clones
displayed increased adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin
(KLK7-181 only) compared with vector control cells (Fig. 3A
and B), with greater adhesion exhibited by KLK7-181 clones
(P < 0.01). There was no difference for collagen I/IV attachment
(data not shown). The increased adhesion to fibronectin/
vitronectin was reduced to basal levels by a β1 integrin blocking antibody for KLK7-181 clones and less for KLK7-253
clones, especially on vitronectin [Fig. 3A and B; KLK7-181,
P < 0.01; KLK7-253, P < 0.05 (fibronectin only)]. As both α5
and β1 integrins regulate MCA formation (7), we used these
functional blocking antibodies in MCA assays. Blocking
α5β1, β1, or KLK7 reduced aggregation of both KLK7-253
(3E4) and KLK7-181 (5D11) clones, whereas cells remained
aggregated with an IgG control (Fig. 3C).
High α5 integrin levels are associated with poor outcome for
EOC patients (6), and increased α5/β1 integrins are responsible for serous EOC cell aggregation (7, 27), disaggregation, and
invasion (8, 10). Of further interest, correlative analysis of our
microarray data revealed a trend between KLK7 and α5 integrin

expression (P = 0.09). Thus, we investigated whether integrin
levels were elevated in KLK7-expressing clones. Flow cytometric analysis showed significant upregulation of cell surface
α5 integrin expression in all KLK7-253 clones and β1 and αvβ3
integrin expression in KLK7-253 4B12, 3F11, and KLK7-181
5D11 clones compared with vector control cells (Fig. 4A). Although there was not a strict correlation for all clones between
α5/β1/KLK7 levels and MCA formation, KLK7-253 clones in
particular expressed the highest KLK7, formed the most compact MCAs, and had increased α5 (three of three) and β1 (two
of three) integrin levels.
KLK7 and α5/β1 integrins are coexpressed in serous
primary EOC cells and tissues
To confirm the relationship between KLK7 and integrin expression clinically, we performed Western blot and densitometric analysis on paired samples of serous EOC cells from
primary tumors and ascites from six women (Fig. 4B and C).
Compared with primary EOC cells, three of six ascites samples
(ID nos. 1, 3, and 5) showed more intense KLK7 bands, four of
six ascites samples (ID nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5) showed more intense
α5 integrin bands (although this was not as apparent on densitometry), and two of six ascites samples (ID nos. 1 and 2)
showed elevated β1 integrin expression. Interestingly, levels

of all three proteins (KLK7 and α5 and β1 integrins) were
greater in ascites compared with primary tumor–derived cells
from a patient who only survived 6 months (Fig. 4B and C; ID
no. 1). Conversely, samples (ID nos. 4 and 6) from patients who
survived 23 and 18 months, respectively, following surgery had
little KLK7 and β1 integrin but similarly intense α5 integrin
bands in their primary tumor–derived and ascites-derived cells.
Representative immunohistochemistry on serial sections
of well-differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors from
seven serous EOC patients who had responded or not to chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S1; Materials and Methods)
is shown in Fig. 4D. Weak KLK7 and α5/β1 integrin immunostaining on the apical membrane was observed for both
well-differentiated tumors that responded to chemotherapy
(Fig. 4D, a, d, and g; ID no. 23). For poorly differentiated serous EOC tissues, two different immunostaining patterns
were observed. Staining intensities for the responders
were similar (KLK7), if not weaker (α5/β1), compared with
well-differentiated tumors (Fig. 4D, b, e, and h; ID no. 34).
Strikingly, however, the staining was more intense for all
three antigens on tissues from the two patients who did
not respond to chemotherapy (Fig. 4D, c, f, and i; ID no. 11).
No staining was detected in the negative control (rabbit IgG;
data not shown).

controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C). Paclitaxel treatment of MCA/
spheroids revealed that MCA-forming KLK7-253 (3E4) and
KLK7-181 (5D11) clones are similarly more resistant toward
paclitaxel (P < 0.001, 3E4; P < 0.01, 5D11) than the non–
MCA-forming KLK7-181 (4A12) or vector cells (Fig. 5D). Although the non–MCA-forming 4A12 clone was more resistant to paclitaxel at 10 nmol/L (P < 0.05), resistance of both
3E4 and 5D11 MCAs is much higher. These data indicate
that KLK7-induced chemoresistance to paclitaxel in two-dimensional monolayers is maintained in the MCAs formed
in three-dimensional monolayers, suggesting one possible
mechanism by which chemoresistance to paclitaxel is induced in vivo, leading to poorer patient outcome in
KLK7-expressing EOCs.

KLK7-expressing cells grow faster and are more
resistant to paclitaxel
MCA formation of EOC cells is associated with increased
resistance to certain chemotherapy regimens (9, 28, 29). Our
clinical data (Supplementary Fig. S4; Supplementary Tables
S1 and S3) and a previous report showed that patients who
had shorter progression-free and overall survival time after
surgery had increased KLK7 expression (18). We then investigated if KLK7-expressing cells proliferate faster and how
they respond to chemoreagents. Clones overexpressing
NH2-terminal truncated KLK7-181 grow faster than vector
controls at 72 and 96 hours (P < 0.05), whereas KLK7-253
clones seemed to have increased proliferation without reaching significance (Fig. 5A). There was no significant difference
in survival after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5B), but both KLK7253 and KLK7-181 cells showed less paclitaxel-induced cell
death over the dose range of 1 to 100 nmol/L than vector

Approximately 75% of EOC patients are diagnosed with intraabdominal dissemination (30). These patients are given
platinum-paclitaxel chemotherapy after surgery, but most
will develop resistance. Our work (Supplementary Fig. S4;
Supplementary Table S3) confirmed that increased KLK7 expression is a hallmark (15) of EOC, particularly the serous
subtype and an association between high KLK7 levels with
high tumor grade, chemoresistance, and shorter survival time
(16–18). We showed that KLK7 directs MCA formation and
chemoresistance likely by upregulating α5β1 integrin pathways.
These observations indicate that KLK7 has potential not only
as a prognostic marker for paclitaxel resistance but also as a
therapeutic target in a subset of serous EOC patients who are
paclitaxel nonresponders and have elevated KLK7 levels.
Expression of cell adhesion proteins, along with proteases,
alters in EOC development (25, 26), although interaction between these molecules is more important during peritoneal
invasion. The initiating step of EOC dissemination is that
cells exfoliate from the primary site into the peritoneal cavity.
KLK7 contributes to skin desquamation via degradation of
cell adhesion glycoproteins (21), and thus, KLK7 may also
help initiate EOC cell shedding by a similar mechanism. In
pancreatic carcinoma, KLK7 cleaves E-cadherin to generate
an ectodomain that promotes cell proliferation and invasion
(31). Loss of E-cadherin and gain of α5 integrin, a subunit of
the major fibronectin receptor, have been related to an aggressive EOC phenotype (6). Interaction between α4β1 integrin
and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 promotes EOC peritoneal metastasis (32); however, we did not see increased α4
integrin in KLK7-expressing clones (data not shown). Collagenbinding integrins, such as α2β1 and α3β1, promote MMP9dependent shedding of E-cadherin ectodomains (10). We did
not see any evidence of E-cadherin processing in our KLK7overexpressing clones nor changes in E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
or cadherin 11/13 mRNA levels (data not shown). However,
KLK7-253–expressing cells showed increased levels of cell
surface α5/β1 integrins (Fig. 4A) from which we propose that
α5β1 integrins may promote the observed cell aggregation
in these cells as previously reported (6, 7). Although integrins
are classically thought to mediate cell-ECM adhesion, cell-cell
adhesion can also be promoted (33). This is evidently the

mechanism seen here as no MCA was observed when α5/β1 integrins were inhibited (Fig. 5C). Compact MCAs are associated
with an invasive EOC phenotype (34), and multicellular aggregation and disaggregation are regulated by MMP14 (35). Our

data imply that other proteases, such as KLK7, are also involved by promoting EOC cell-cell adhesion in suspension
via increased levels of α5/β1 integrins. Knocking down α5/β1
integrins reduced peritoneal seeding of ovarian cancer cells

(36), and thus, in conjunction with our data, KLK7 blocking
might be an alternative therapeutic target for inhibiting serous
EOC peritoneal invasion.
Inside the abdominal cavity, single cancer cells and MCAs/
spheroids attach to the peritoneum composed of a single
mesothelial cell layer over the ECM substrata. Collagen I/IV,
vitronectin, and fibronectin are predominant components of
the peritoneal ECM targeted by EOC cells (11, 37). KLK7-253
and, in particular, KLK7-181 clones displayed increased
attachment to fibronectin/vitronectin (Fig. 3A and B). Interestingly, there is no increased adhesion of KLK7 cells to mesothelial cells grown in two-dimensional culture compared with
vector cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C); nevertheless,
MCAs formed by KLK7 cells attached to mesothelial cell layers
and invaded to form cancer cell foci (Fig. 2C). Although
mechanisms underlying interactions between MCAs and the
peritoneal membrane remain unknown, in both in vitro omentum three-dimensional coculture and in vivo mouse models,
EOC cells express and secrete more MMP2 that degrades peritoneal fibronectin and presumably increases tumor invasion
(11), which may be one of the mechanisms observed here given
the MMP2 activity seen on zymography (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Yet, KLK7 may be another protease that acts
similarly; KLK7 degrades fibronectin to contribute to cell
shedding (38) but reduces cell adhesion to vitronectin
and enhances urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor shedding in pancreatic carcinoma (39). This may be
an additional mechanism in our study, as vitronectin adhesion was not increased to the same degree in KLK7-253
compared with KLK7-181 clones (Fig. 3B). Cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1β, a KLK7
substrate (40), disrupt the peritoneal integrity by altering
the morphology of mesothelial cells (41). This increases
the exposure of the ECM (41) and promotes the invasion of
attached malignant cells. Collectively, these findings may be
reflected in more aggressive clinical phenotypes of patients
with high KLK7-expressing and α5/β1 integrin–expressing
tumors (Fig. 4B–D) observed here.
MCA/spheroid formation helps single cells overcome anoikis
and to survive in an ascites suspension environment (25, 26).
Paclitaxel resistance is also related to spheroid formation in
three-dimensional suspension cultures (9, 29). Paclitaxel
changes integrin expression, including α5β1 integrin (42). Thus,
the increased cell survival of KLK7-expressing cells with
increased α5/β1 integrins following paclitaxel treatment may
reflect the role of these ECM receptors in cellular responses
to treatment (43) perhaps by the bcl-2 pathway, as both integrins suppress apoptosis via this mechanism (44). EOC cells
exposed to paclitaxel accumulate at G2-M and a sub-G1 apoptotic phase when cultured as monolayers but not as spheroids.
This relative sensitivity of two-dimensional monolayer cultures
was associated with decreased bcl-X(L) levels after paclitaxel exposure but not in three-dimensional spheroids (9). MCAs are
more resistant to chemotherapy than monolayers in vitro (9).
However, in our hands, both KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 cells were
less responsive to paclitaxel in either two-dimensional monolayers or three-dimensional MCAs (Fig. 5C and D), underscoring
the robustness of KLK7-induced paclitaxel chemoresistance

and perhaps reflecting increased KLK7/α5/β1 levels seen in
patients who were poor responders to chemotherapy (Fig. 4D;
Supplementary Table S1).
Northern blot analyses showed two KLK7 mRNA transcripts, KLK7-253 and KLK7-181, in skin (45) and serous EOC
cells (15). KLK7-253 encodes the known active serine protease,
whereas the exon 1–deleted KLK7-181 variant (15) encodes an
NH2-terminal truncated KLK7-181 isoform that is not secreted
or a protease. Its concurrently high expression with KLK7-253
in EOC implies that this truncated KLK7-181 isoform has an
adjunct intracellular function, although it is not yet detected
at the protein level in clinical samples. We also could not
determine the relative contribution (whether synergistic or
dominant negative) of the KLK7-181 isoform from coculture
experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2C), an attempt to mimic
the simultaneous presence of both KLK7 variants in EOC. Nevertheless, although all KLK7-253 clones formed large MCAs,
suggesting that proteolysis plays a role, one KLK7-181 clone
(5D11) also formed spheroids (Fig. 4A), suggesting that proteolysis alone is not sufficient for MCA formation. That the functional KLK7 blocking antibody abolished MCA formation not
only of KLK7-253 (4B12) clones but also of KLK7-181 (5D11)
clones (Fig. 5C) further supports this notion. KLK7-181 cells
showed increased proliferation (Fig. 5A) and increased adhesion to fibronectin/vitronectin (Fig. 3A and B), whereas
KLK7-253 clones only showed increased attachment to fibronectin, further underscoring functional differences between
both isoforms, which remain to be clarified. Native SKOV-3
cells treated with activated KLK7 enzyme also aggregated
faster than those treated with the proteolytically inactive
pro-KLK7 (Supplementary Fig. S2A), so presumably there are
both proteolytic and nonproteolytic aspects of the functional
roles of KLK7 isoforms. Notably, proteolytic-dependent and
proteolytic-independent effects induced by prostasin, an extracellular serine protease, have been documented in prostate
cancer cells (46); thus, there is precedence for this paradox.

In summary, we have confirmed that high KLK7 levels are
indicative of poor outcome for EOC patients and, to our
knowledge, for the first time have shown a link with paclitaxel
chemoresistance. We have addressed a potential mechanism
of action of KLK7 in EOC progression. Our data support the notion that the serine protease KLK7-253 and the NH2-terminal
truncated nonproteolytic KLK7-181 isoform promote MCAs,
which are paclitaxel resistant. Increased levels of α5/β1 integrins in KLK7-expressing cells and intense staining of both integrins in EOC tissue sections with high KLK7 expression imply
their association in promoting EOC cell dissemination and
chemoresistance. Collectively, these findings suggest that
KLK7 enhances the expression and function of integrin adhesion receptors and that both KLK7-253 and KLK7-181 isoforms
function in EOC peritoneal invasion by mediating MCA and
paclitaxel chemoresistance.
