Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Mutations disabling the TP53 tumour suppressor gene represent the most frequent events in human
cancer and typically occur through a two-hit mechanism involving a missense mutation in one
allele and a ‘loss of heterozygosity’ deletion encompassing the other. While TP53 missense
mutations can also contribute gain-of-function activities that impact tumour progression, it
remains unclear whether the deletion event, which frequently includes many genes, impacts
tumorigenesis beyond TP53 loss alone. Here we show that somatic heterozygous deletion of
mouse chromosome 11B3, a 4-megabase region syntenic to human 17p13.1, produces a greater
effect on lymphoma and leukaemia development than Trp53 deletion. Mechanistically, the effect
of 11B3 loss on tumorigenesis involves co-deleted genes such as Eif5a and Alox15b (also known
as Alox8), the suppression of which cooperates with Trp53 loss to produce more aggressive
disease. Our results imply that the selective advantage produced by human chromosome 17p
deletion reflects the combined impact of TP53 loss and the reduced dosage of linked tumour
suppressor genes.

Cancer arises through the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic changes that drive
tumorigenesis. While most efforts to understand the origins of these entities have focused on
the identification and functional characterization of somatic single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) that activate oncogenes or inactivate tumour suppressors, the vast majority of human
cancers also harbour large copy number variants (CNVs) that impact gene dosage through
gain or loss of whole chromosomes or chromosome segments1. For example, recurrent
segmental deletions—such as those affecting chromosome 17p—are extremely common in
human cancers yet are widely considered to arise because of selection for a single ‘driver’ in
the deleted region, with the adjacent gene losses reflecting ‘passenger’ events that have no
effect on tumour phenotypes. However, evidence is emerging from short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) screens and bioinformatic approaches that these lesions may target more than one
relevant activity2–5. If true, then the impact of segmental deletions on tumour development
would be fundamentally distinct from SNVs, yet, given their frequent occurrence,
disproportionately understudied.

Chromosome 17p configurations in human cancer

Author Manuscript

We decided to study 17p deletion as a prototype of a recurrent cancer-associated deletion
owing to its high frequency and invariable inclusion of TP53, an extensively studied tumour
suppressor gene that is considered to be the major driver of 17p loss6,7. To characterize
better the nature and scope of these deletions, we analysed genomic data from 4,994
tumours across 18 cancer types (http://www.cbioportal.org; accessed 29 October 2014). This
survey confirmed previous indications that mutation and/or deletion of the TP53 tumour
suppressor gene occurs in approximately ~50% of all human cancers8. We then classified
17p-altered tumours as to whether they displayed TP53 mutation (encompassing missense,
nonsense and frameshift mutations), deletion (as defined by a reduction in TP53 copy
number), or both (Fig. 1a). The most common TP53 configuration involves a missense
mutation together with a segmental 17p deletion, although a substantial fraction of p53altered tumours harboured chromosome 17p deletion together with an apparently wild-type
TP53 allele. Similar results were observed in blood cancers, in which TP53 mutations and/or

17p loss are less common but are linked to a particularly dismal prognosis9,10. Hence, the
frequency of 17p deletion may even exceed point mutations within the TP53 gene.
Chromosome 17p deletions frequently encompass all or most of the chromosome arm (Fig.
1b). In addition to TP53, this region encodes over 300 protein-coding genes that include
other established or putative tumour suppressors11–13. Unexpectedly, TP53 was not
identified as a candidate tumour suppressor in non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) using GISTIC, an algorithm designed to pinpoint candidate drivers from
CNV data by identifying ‘epicentres’ of gain or loss14 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b).
Moreover, AMLs harbouring a TP53 mutation together with a 17p deletion displayed a
worse prognosis than those harbouring TP53 mutations alone (Fig. 1c and Extended Data
Fig. 1c). Collectively, these data raise the possibility that additional genes drive selection for
17p loss during tumorigenesis.

Modelling 17p13 deletions in the mouse

Author Manuscript

We decided to test this hypothesis in mice. To produce a strain capable of modelling somatic
17p deletions, we used the MICER chromosome engineering strategy developed
previously15 to introduce loxP sites and a split HPRT gene into chromosomal regions
flanking the Alox12 and Scol genes on mouse chromosome 11B3, which is a 4 Mb region
on mouse chromosome 11 that is syntenic to human 17p13.1 (Fig. 2a, b and Extended Data
Fig. 2a, b). Candidate clones were treated with adenovirus (Adeno)-cre to recombine the
11B3 region, selected in hypoxanthine–aminopterin–thymidine (HAT) medium, and
subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to discriminate between cis and
trans recombination events (Extended Data Fig. 2c). This readily identified embryonic stem
(ES) cell clones harbouring loxP sites flanking 11B3 in cis and revealed that 11B3 deletion
is not deleterious to ES cells (data not shown). We refer to the appropriately targeted allele
above as 11B3flox (11B3fl).

11B3fl mice were produced by blastocyst injection and crossed to a variety of constitutive
and haematopoietic-directed Cre mouse lines. We never observed viable progeny harbouring
a recombined 11B3 deletion arising from 11B3fl crosses with Ella-cre or constitutive CAGcre mice, implying that heterozygous deletion of the 11B3 interval confers embryonic
lethality. However, double-mutant progeny harbouring the cre transgene and an
unrecombined 11B3fl allele were produced (Extended Data Table 1), perhaps surviving
owing to inefficient recombination between the two distant (~4 Mb) loxP sites.

Author Manuscript

As in ES cells, somatic 11B3 deletion in the haematopoietic compartment was not an
obligate cell lethal event; thus, recombined cells were detected in the peripheral blood of
11B3fl/+ mice crossed to strains harbouring Cd19-cre, Mx1-cre or Vav1-cre alleles
(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, the apparent recombination frequency was
substantially lower than observed in progeny of conditional Trp53--knockout mice crossed
to the same strains (20% versus 100%; Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). While such differences
can complicate direct comparisons of tumour onset between 11B3fl and Trp53fl animals, we
reasoned that changes in the fraction of 11B3-deleted cells over time should indicate
whether 11B3 loss provides a competitive advantage during tumorigenesis.

We first tested whether somatic deletion of 11B3 could drive cancer development in the EμMyc transgenic model of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as Trp53 deletion potently accelerates
lymphomagenesis in this model16,17 and because 17p alterations are associated with adverse
prognosis in the corresponding human disease18 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Accordingly, EμMyc mice were crossed to the 11B3fl allele and a Vav1-cre transgenic strain, and the
resulting progeny were monitored for tumour onset (Fig. 2c). Mice harbouring the 11B3fl
allele developed lymphomas much more rapidly than controls (59 versus 130 days, P <
0.001), clearly indicating that loss of the 11B3 region can promote tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Paradoxically, Eμ-Myc;Trp53fl/+;Vavl-cre mice developed lymphomas even more rapidly
than Eμ-Myc;11B3fl/+;Vav1-cre animals (Extended Data Fig. 3d). While this observation is
consistent with a potentially negative impact of 11B3 deletion on cellular fitness, it might
also reflect the nearly fivefold reduced recombination efficiency of the 11B3fl versus Trp53fl
alleles. Consistent with the idea of reduced recombination efficiency, semi-quantitative and
quantitative (q)PCR analysis indicated a massive enrichment in the fraction of 11B3-deleted
cells in lymphomas compared with the premalignant setting (~100% versus 15%; Fig. 2d, e),
which was confirmed by genome sequencing (Fig. 2f). Although lymphomas arising in the
Trp53rfl/+ and 11B3fl/+ animals were both highly disseminated, 11B3-deleted lymphomas
typically presented as a more mature B-cell type and showed enhanced resistance to certain
chemotherapeutic agents (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Thus, 11B3 deletion confers a selective
advantage during lymphomagenesis and produces phenotypes distinct from a Trp53-null
setting.

p53 is induced after DNA damage, when it activates transcription of target genes involved in
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and other cellular processes19,20. Strikingly, all 11B3-deleted
lymphomas showed either high or undetectable levels of p53 protein, and none were capable
of inducing the p53 transcriptional target p21 (also known as Cdkn1a) after treatment with
the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drug adriamycin (ADR). Such a pattern is reminiscent
of lymphoma cells that acquire inactivating Trp53 mutations21,22 and indeed, most 11B3deleted lymphomas (75%) acquired missense or nonsense mutations in the remaining wildtype Trp53 allele (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Other 11B3-deleted lymphomas displayed no p53
activity, suggesting that each acquired some other mutational or epigenetic event that
disabled the intact wild-type Trp53 allele. Regardless, the majority of 11B3-deleted
lymphomas display chromosome configurations analogous to the common TP53 mutation/
deletion events observed in human cancers (Fig. 1a and Fig. 2g).

Author Manuscript

We also tested the mechanisms of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) arising in conventional
Trp53-mutant mouse models. To this end, we generated Eμ-Myc strains with the following
additional alleles: Trp53+/−, Vav1-cre; Trp53fl/+, Vav1-cre;Trp53LSL-R270H/+, or Vav1cre;Trp53LSL-R172H/+, and analysed the fate of the remaining Trp53 allele upon lymphoma
manifestation using a qPCR assay to detect the copy number of select regions flanking
Trp53. In these models LOH clearly does not involve deletion of the remaining Trp53 locus,
as the genes proximal and distal to Trp53 (for example, Eif5a and Sco1/Alox12,
respectively) remained diploid in all cases (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Instead, this analysis
suggests that LOH occurs through duplication of the targeted mutant Trp53 allele, a
conclusion that was confirmed by analysis of polymorphic markers in this region (Fig. 2g

and Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). While such 17p configurations occur in human tumours, they
are less frequent than those involving large deletions (see Fig. 1a).

Role of 11B3 deletion in lymphomagenesis

Author Manuscript

Although the data described earlier demonstrate that 11B3 deletion can contribute to
tumorigenesis, the differences in recombination frequencies between the conditional 11B3
and Trp53 alleles made it impossible to assess whether other genes in the 11B3 deletion
contribute to its effects. To mitigate this caveat without extensive strain intercrossing, we
exploited the capability of shRNAs to suppress gene expression in trans, hypothesizing that
any phenotypic differences arising between wild-type and 11B3-deleted cells expressing a
potent Trp53 shRNA would be independent of Trp53. As immunoblotting and qPCR with
reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analysis confirmed that our Trp53 shRNA was equally
capable of disabling Trp53 in pre-B cells harbouring one or two Trp53 alleles (Extended
Data Fig. 6), we co-transduced pre-B cells derived from the bone marrow of Vav1-cre and
Vav1-cre;11B3fl/+ mice with a Myc complementary DNA (linked to GFP) and the Trp53
shRNA (linked to mCherry) and studied tumorigenesis upon their transplantation into
irradiated recipient mice.

Author Manuscript

Mice receiving cells harbouring the conditional 11B3 deletion and the Trp53 shRNA
developed tumours more rapidly than those transplanted with cells harbouring the Trp53
shRNA alone (Fig. 3a; median onset 28 versus 36 days, P < 0.01). In both the 11B3fl/+ and
11B3+/+ settings, the disease presented as an aggressive B-cell malignancy (data not shown)
in which p53 protein and activity were undetectable (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the subsequent
lymphomas were double positive for GFP and mCherry, indicating that they retained the
Myc cDNA and Trp53 shRNA (data not shown). While only 15–20% of the premalignant
cells underwent 11B3 recombination, almost all of the resulting lymphoma cells harboured
this deletion (Fig. 3c). Thus, 11B3 deletion confers a strong selective advantage even in the
absence of detectable p53 function.

Author Manuscript

To identify genetic elements within the 11B3 interval that act together with Trp53 to
suppress lymphoma development, we first took a candidate gene approach. We noted that
virtually all lymphoma-associated 17p deletions encompass both TP53 and E1F5A (see Fig.
1b), the latter gene also having been identified as a tumour suppressor that promotes
apoptosis11. To examine interactions between these genes during lymphomagenesis,
validated shRNAs targeting Trp53 and/or Eif5a, co-expressed in tandem, were introduced
into Eμ-Myc haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and then transplanted into
syngeneic recipients. As expected, suppression of either Trp53 or Eif5a accelerated
lymphomagenesis relative to controls, which did not develop tumours over the time of
evaluation (Fig. 4a; median onset 56 and 99.5 days, respectively). Still, co-suppression of
both Trp53 and Eif5a produced lymphomas even more rapidly (median onset 45 days).
Apparently, premalignant cells co-suppressing Trp53 and Eif5a shRNAs have an increased
selective advantage compared with cells expressing either shRNA alone, a suggestion that
was confirmed by an in vivo competition assay (Extended Data Fig. 7) and apoptosis
measurements in premalignant cells (Fig. 4b)16,23,24. Although our shRNA technology

cannot precisely mimic the gene dosage produced by a heterozygous gene deletion, these
data identify Eif5a as a second gene in the 11B3 interval that can contribute to its activity.
To test whether additional 17p13 genes have a role, we generated a shRNA library targeting
the ~100 protein-coding genes in the 11B3 region (exclusive of Trp53 and Eif5a) and
screened it for tumour-promoting activity in HSPC transplantation assays (Fig. 4c; 17p13
shRNA library detailed in Supplementary Table 1). Compared with controls, these libraries
accelerated lymphomagenesis in recipient mice, implying that one or more shRNAs
conferred a selective advantage (Fig. 4d). To identify such shRNAs, PCR products amplified
from genomic DNA were subject to deep sequencing and the abundance of each shRNA
compared to the initial pool. Forty shRNAs targeting 17 genes were enriched in tumours
compared to the injected population (Supplementary Table 1).

Author Manuscript

Among the potential candidates, two shRNAs targeting Alox15b (shAlox15b.1252 and
shAlox15b.2865), showed a 245- and 50-fold enrichment, respectively, compared with their
representation in the initial library (Extended Data Fig. 8a). We thus tested whether
suppression of Alox15b alone or in combination with Trp53 could accelerate tumorigenesis
as was done for Eif5a. Recipients of HSPCs targeted with Alox15b shRNAs had
significantly shorter lymphoma-free survival than shRen controls (Fig. 4e), and those
receiving HSPCs harbouring Alox15b-Trp53 tandem shRNA showed a further acceleration
over shTrp53-shRen controls (Fig. 4f).

Author Manuscript

Partial knockdown of Alox15b by shRNAs in NIH3T3 cells resulted in accumulation of its
substrate, arachidonic acid (AA) (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c), and higher AA levels were
detected in 11B3-deleted lymphoma cells compared with their Trp53-null counterparts
(Extended Data Fig. 8d). Interestingly, AA suppresses apoptosis in certain cancer cells25
and, in agreement, exogenous AA inhibited apoptosis of pre-B cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Extended Data Fig. 8e). While a complete mechanistic understanding of its effects
will require further work, these studies pinpoint Alox15b as an additional tumour suppressor
in the 11B3 region. Intriguingly, shRNAs targeting two other Alox family genes adjacent to
Alox15b were enriched in our screen (Alox12b, Alox3e), raising the possibility that 17p
deletion coordinately attenuates the output of this gene family. Additionally, beyond proteincoding genes, the reduced dosage of non-coding RNAs not tested in our screen might
contribute to the activity of 17p deletions26.

11B3 deletion contributes to AML

Author Manuscript

We also asked whether 11B3 loss would enhance tumorigenesis in a genetically and
pathologically accurate mouse model of complex-karyotype AML, an invariably lethal
leukaemia subtype9,27,28. In this disease, TP53 lesions often co-occur with NF1 loss and
deletions on 5q and/or 7q, which can be approximated in mice transplanted with Trp53−/−
HSPCs co-expressing shRNAs targeting Nf1 and Mll3 (also known as Kmt2c) (encoded on
human 7q36)29. Taking advantage of the flexibility of this model, we compared disease
onset and pathology in mice transplanted with shNf1-shMll3-transduced HSPCs derived
from either Vav1-cre;Trp53fl/fl or Vav1-cre;11B3fl/Trp53fl mice (Fig. 5a).

These experiments revealed a clear and substantial p53-independent effect of 11B3 deletion
on leukaemia development. Indeed, despite the reduced recombination frequency of the
11B3 allele (Extended Data Fig. 9a), recipients of Vav1-cre;11B3fl/Trp53fl HSPCs had a
significantly decreased survival compared with recipients of Vav1-cre;Trp53fl/fl HSPCs, and
succumbed to an aggressive form of AML (Fig. 5b, c and Extended Data Fig. 9b–d; median
overall survival 62 versus 81 days, P = 0.002). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis
confirmed that 11B3 genes were underexpressed in 11B3-deleted AML cells compared with
those in the Trp53-null setting (Fig. 5d), and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that
transcriptional profiles of human 17p13 genes are downregulated in human AMLs
harbouring 17p13 deletions (Fig. 5e). Moreover, 11B3-deleted AMLs were capable of serial
transplantation into secondary recipients, where they promoted disease more rapidly than
their Trp53-null counterparts (Fig. 5f). Finally, while the Trp53−/− AMLs are sensitive to the
BET-protein inhibitor JQ1 (ref. 29), the corresponding 11B3−/Trp53− AML showed reduced
sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 9e, f). Hence, 11B3 deletions contribute p53-independent
phenotypes to AML.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

This study provides compelling evidence that 17p deletion confers phenotypes beyond those
achieved through TP53 loss alone. When considered in light of the established gain-offunction properties of certain missense Trp53 mutations, our results imply that the most
frequent somatic event in cancer contributes multiple activities that act independently of
Trp53 inactivation to drive tumorigenesis. It therefore seems likely that tumours harbouring
TP53 lesions—typically considered a uniform entity—produce distinct phenotypes owing to
the nature of the TP53 mutation and the extent of 17p deletion. As such, the models
described here will be useful for dissecting precisely how different 17p configurations affect
disease onset and ultimately impact therapy response. More broadly, our study provides
direct in vivo evidence that segmental deletion events can arise owing to the selective
advantage of disrupting multiple genes and provides a blueprint to dissect these common but
understudied cancer-promoting lesions.

METHODS
Genomic analyses of human cancers

Author Manuscript

The data on TP53 mutations (including allele frequency) and CNVs in pan-tumours and
AML are derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data in the cBioPortal for Cancer
Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/; accessed on 29 October 2014). Only sequenced
samples with allele frequency information provided were included in our analysis.
Considering potential normal tissue contamination, samples with TP53 mutation allele
frequency above 0.6 were considered as a homozygous mutation. The SNP data were
visualized in IGV and statistics for AML outcome were analysed in Prism 6. Since
cBioPortal only has a few non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases available, we used published data
to extract TP53 mutation and deletion information18,30–34. Clinical outcomes were annotated
from follow-up data available within the Gene Expression Omnibus GSE34171 series.

Conditional 11B3-knockout model

Author Manuscript

To create a conditional 11B3 chromosome deletion, the MICER strategy was used15. Briefly,
MICER clones MHPN91j22 (centromeric to Sco1) and MHPP248j19 (telomeric to Alox12)
(Sanger Institute) were introduced into AB2.2 ES cells (129S5 strain, Sanger Institute) by
sequential electroporation, followed by G418 (neomycin; 180 μg ml−1) and puromycin (1 μg
ml−1) selection, respectively. Successful recombination events were confirmed by Southern
blotting using the hybridized probes designated in Supplementary Table 2 as described38.
The cis- and trans-localizations of two loxP sites in doubly targeted ES cells were further
distinguished by PCR with df-F and df-R, or dp-F and dp-R (Supplementary Table 2),
respectively, after Adeno-cre infection and HAT (Gibco) selection. Correct cis-ES clones in
which two loxP sites were integrated into the same allele were used to generate chimaera
mice by blastocyst injection. The F1 pups were genotyped with 11B3-F and 11B3-R primers
(Supplementary Table 2) and those positive backcrossed to C57BL/6 mouse strains for more
than 10 generations.

Trp53LSL-R270H/+, Trp53LSL-R72H/+, Trp53+/−, Trp53fl/+ and Rag1−/− mice were ordered
from Jackson Laboratories21,39–44 and the Arf+/− mouse strain is a gift from C. Sherr45. EμMyc mice with different Trp53 alterations were monitored weekly with disease state being
defined by palpable enlarged solid lymph nodes and/or paralysis. Tumour monitoring was
done as blinded experiments. For lymphoma generated by transplantation, 1 million Eμ-Myc
HPSCs from embryonic day (E)13.5 fetal liver or autoMACS-purified B220+ B progenitor
cells isolated from 6–8-week mouse bone marrow were transduced with retroviruses,
followed by tail-vein injection into sublethally irradiated (6 Gy, Cs137) C57BL/6 mice
(Taconic; 6–8-week old, female, 5–10 mice per cohort)11,46. All recipient mice were
randomly divided into subgroups before transplantation and monitored as described earlier.
The generation of AML proceeded as previously reported29. Briefly, retrovirally infected cKit+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were transplanted into sublethally irradiated
(6 Gy, Cs137) C57BL/6 mice, followed by routine monitoring of peripheral blood cell
counts and Giemsa–Wright blood smear staining. For secondary transplantation
experiments, 1 million leukaemia cells were transplanted into sublethally irradiated (4.5 Gy)
mice. The immunophenotypes of resulting lymphomas and leukaemias were determined by

B220+ cells were isolated from the bone marrow of 6-week-old Eμ-Myc mice by autoMACS
positive selection with anti-B220 microbeads (Militeny Biotech). After overnight culture,
cells were infected with retroviruses carrying the indicated shRNAs. Two days after
infection, 0.5 × 106 cells were washed with PBS followed by annexin V buffer (10 mM
HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and incubated at room temperature with
Pacific Blue annexin V (BD Biosciences) and propridium iodide (PI; 1 μg ml−1; SigmaAldrich) for 15 min and analysed on a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For
arachidonic acid treatment, pre-B cells were cultured out from bone marrow cells in pre-B
cell medium (RPMI1640, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μM β-mercap-toethanol,
3 ng ml−1 IL-7). After 3 days culture, pre-B cells were treated with a series concentration of
arachidonic acid (Cayman Chemical) for 20 h, followed by annexin V staining as described

Immunoblotting
Lymphoma cells isolated from lymph nodes of diseased animals were treated with vehicle
(PBS) or 1 μg ml−1 adriamycin for 4 h. Whole cell lysates were extracted in cell lysis buffer
(Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche), followed by
SDS–PAGE gel electrophoresis and blotting onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). EμMyc;Arf−/− lymphoma cell lines were used as a positive control for p53 induction. The p53
antibody used was obtained from Novocastra (NCL-p53-505) and horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated β-actin antibody from Sigma (AC-15). Alox15b expressions were
examined in NIH3T3 cells, which were infected by shRNAs targeting Ren or Alox15b and
then selected by G418. Anti-Alox15b antibody is from Sigma (SAB2100110), and HRPconjugated GAPDH antibody is from ThermoFisher Scientific (MA5-15738-HRP).

quality control on an Agilent BioAnalyzer, 500 ng of total RNA (RNA integrity number > 8)
underwent polyA selection and Truseq library preparation according to instructions provided
by Illumina (TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v.2) with 6 cycles of PCR. Samples were
barcoded and run on a Hiseq 2500 in a 50 bp/50 bp paired-end run, using the TruSeq SBS
Kit v.3 (Illumina). An average of 45 million paired reads were generated per sample. At the
most the ribosomal reads represented 0.1% and the percentage of mRNA bases was close to
65% on average. The output from the sequencers (FASTQ files) was mapped to the mouse
genome (mm9) using the rnaStar (https://code.google.com/p/rna-star/) aligner, with the twopass mapping methods. After mapping, the expression counts of each individual gene were
computed using HTSeq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq), followed by
normalization and differential expression analysis among samples using the R/Bioconductor
package DESeq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/DESeq). Gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) was performed with Broad’s GSEA algorithm.

Quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

A list of all primers used for PCR analysis is given in Supplementary Table 2. For detection
and quantification of 11B3 recombination/deletion two methods were employed. In both
cases genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from lymphoma or leukaemia cells using
Puregene DNA purification kit (Qiagen). Initially, semi-quantitative PCR was used to detect
the recombined 11B3 allele using primers df-F and df-R, generating a 2.2 kb product (Fig.
2d). The estimated frequency of recombination was determined by dropping gDNA from
11B3+/– into 11B3fl/+ at various ratios. For qPCR of the 11B3 deletion (Fig. 2e), SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used and cycling and analysis was
carried out on a ViiA 7 (Applied Biosystems). Primers 11B3-Q-F and 11B3-Q-R were used
to detect the floxed allele, and to estimate the frequency of 11B3 deletion. Allelic frequency
in UPD analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5a) was determined similarly, in this case with serial
dilution of wild-type gDNA into DNase-free water to construct a standard curve. Two-tailed
t-test is used for statistics analysis by Prism 6. For p21 gene expression examination by RT–
qPCR, RNA was isolated with Trizol, cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) and qPCR was performed as described earlier
with primers p21-Q-F and p21-Q-R.
Trp53 genomic DNA sequencing

Trp53 exons (2–10) were amplified from genomic DNAs of 11B3-deleted lymphomas by
PCR (see Supplementary Table 2 for primer sequences) and subjected to Sanger sequencing.
Mutations were called only if detected in sequencing reads carried out in the forward and
reverse direction.

Author Manuscript

SNP analysis
SNP analysis of isolated lymphoma (tumour) or tail (normal) genomic DNAs from the same
tumour-bearing mouse were carried out by Charles River laboratory. Briefly, a SNP Taqman
assay with competing FAM- or VIC-labelled probes was used to detect the relevant
C57BL/6 and 129S SNPs (D11Mit4 and D11NDS16) as described previously50.

Copy number profiling

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA was extracted from freshly isolated lymphoma cells from one Eμ-Myc;
11B3fl/+; Vav-cre mice. One microgram of DNA was sonicated (17 W, 75 s) on an E220
sonicator (Covaris). Samples were subsequently prepared using standard Illumina library
preparation (end repair, poly A addition, and adaptor ligation). Libraries were purified using
AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), PCR enriched, and sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq instrument in a multiplexed format. Sequencing reads per sample were
mapped using Bowtie with PCR duplicates removed. Approximately 2.5 million uniquely
mappable reads were further processed for copy number determination using the ‘varbin’
algorithm51,52 with 5,000 bins, allowing for a median resolution of ~600 kb. GC content
normalization, segmentation and copy number estimation was calculated as described53.
shRNA library construction and tumour sequencing

Author Manuscript

A custom shRNA library was designed to target mouse homologues (six shRNAs for one
gene) to all human protein-coding genes on chromosome 17p13.1 from ALOX12 to SCO1,
except TP53 and EIF5A. shRNAs were cloned into a retrovirus-based vector MLS by poolspecific PCR as previously described11. Eμ-Myc HSPCs infected with pooled shRNAs were
transplanted into sublethally irradiated recipient mice. Resulting tumours were harvested,
and used to extract contained shRNAs, followed by HiSeq in HiSeq 2500 (Illumina).
Twenty-two oligonucleotides of shRNAs used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table 3.
LC-MS

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Total lipids were extracted using Folch’s method54 and analysed by LC-MS as previously
described55. Briefly, freshly harvested cells were homogenized by chloroform/methanol
(2:1, v-v). After being washed by water, the lipid-containing chloroform phase is evaporated.
Dried lipids were dissolved in 100 μl 95% acetonitrile (in H2O), sonicated for 3–5 min, and
spiked with 10 μl of 500 ng ml−1 deuterated internal standard solution (IS; arachidonic acidd8; Cayman Chemical, 390010). Then, 5 μl samples were injected into Acquity ultra
performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters), equipped with Acquity UPLC
BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm I.D., 1.7 μm; Waters). Samples were washed through
the column with a gradient 0.1% formic acid: acetonitrile mobile elution from 35:65 (v:v) to
5:95 for 10 min. Flow rate was 0.25 ml min−1. Right after HPLC, samples were analysed in
a Quattro Premier EX triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters), which has electrospray
negative mode and MasslynxV4.1 software. For each run, a standard curve was generated
with different concentration of arachidonic acid lipid maps MS standard (Cayman Chemical,
10007268) mixed with IS (50 ng ml−1 final concentration). Arachidonic acid standard m/z is
303.2, and IS is 311.3.
In vitro drug response assays
Three Eμ-Myc lymphoma cell lines generated from Trp53fl/+;Vav1-cre or 11B3fl/+; Vavl-cre
tumour-bearing mice were cultured in BCM medium (45% DMEM, 45% IMDM, 10% FBS,
2 mM glutamine, 50 μM β- mercap-toethanol, 1 × penicillin/streptomycin) in 96-well plates.
Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide

of living cells was determined by PI staining and cell counting on a Guava EasyCyte (EMD
Millipore). Leukaemia cell lines from Trp53Δ/Δ or 11B3Δ/Trp53Δ;shNf1;shMll3 mice were
treated with cytarabine (araC; Bedford Laboratories) or JQ1 (a gift from J. Bradner) in stem
cell medium (BCM medium supplemented with 1 ng ml−1 IL-3, 4 ng ml−1 IL-6 and 10 ng
ml−1 SCF) and cell viability after 3 days was determined similarly. All cytokines are from
Invitrogen.
