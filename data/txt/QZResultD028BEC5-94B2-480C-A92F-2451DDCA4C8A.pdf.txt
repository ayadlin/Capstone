ABSTRACT
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of nonHodgkin’s lymphoma. Improvements in overall survival have been observed with
the introduction of rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), however, prognostic markers are still needed.
Methylation of the death associated protein kinase (DAPK or DAPK1) gene and TP53
mutations are likely to have prognostic value in DLBCL. We have assessed TP53
mutations and allelic DAPK1 methylation patterns in a cohort of 119 DLBCL patients
uniformly treated with R-CHOP-like regimens. We found that DAPK1 promoter
methylation was associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.017) and diseasespecific survival (p=0.023). In multivariate analyses DAPK1 methylation remained
as an independent prognostic factor predicting disease-specific survival (p=0.038).
When only considering individuals heterozygous for the rs13300553 SNP monoallelic
methylation of the A-allele was associated with shorter overall- and disease-specific
survival (p<0.001). Patients carrying both DAPK1 methylation and a TP53 mutation
had an inferior survival compared to patients carrying only one of these molecular
alterations, however, this was borderline statistically significant. Allele-specific DAPK1
methylation patterns were also studied in a cohort of 67 multiple myeloma patients,
and all of the methylated multiple myeloma samples heterozygous for the rs13300553
SNP were methylated on both alleles.

development of novel therapies aiming at causing DLBCL
cells to undergo apoptosis [2].
DAP-kinase (DAPK or DAPK1) is a serine/
threonine kinase that has a calcium/calmodulin activated
autoregulatory domain in its N-terminus. In addition,
DAPK1 has a number of extra-catalytic domains, including
ankyrin repeats and a death domain, which facilitate
interactions with numerous other proteins [3]. Many of these
proteins have been implicated in cancer. Most prominent
is p53, which is both an indirect and direct substrate of
DAPK1. The indirect mechanism of DAPK1 dependent
p53-activation is through activation of the ARF tumour

such as deletion of the INK4a/ARF locus at chromosome
9p21 or MIR34A promoter methylation, are associated
with exceedingly poor prognosis [15–17].
A variety of different methods are available for
DNA methylation studies, all having inherent strengths
and weaknesses [18, 19]. However, the vast majority does
not evaluate allelic methylation patterns. Hence, only very
few studies have investigated allelic methylation patterns
of tumour suppressor genes in cancer. We, and others,
have previously shown that validation of methylationspecific PCR (MSP) products by pyrosequencing provides
a sensitive and specific method for the study of methylation
[13, 20]. In addition, we designed our DAPK1 methylation
assay to allow allele-specific methylation information to be
obtained, as we hypothesized that biallelic methylation of
DAPK1 is a more severe event compared to monoallelic
methylation.
In this contribution, we have increased a previously
studied cohort [13] to 119 patients uniformly treated
with R-CHOP-like regimens and increased the follow-up
time. In addition to allelic DAPK1 methylation patterns,
mutation status of the TP53 gene was evaluated. Potential
correlation between DAPK1 methylation and TP53
mutations was investigated. Effects on overall survival
and disease-specific survival were investigated for DAPK1
methylation, DAPK1 allelic methylation patterns, and
TP53 mutations, alone or in combination. Allele-specific
expression of DAPK1 mRNA was studied in a subset
of the samples heterozygous for the rs3818584 SNP. In
addition, allelic DAPK1 methylation patterns were studied
in a cohort of 67 multiple myeloma patients.

suppressor, which inhibits MDM2, an inhibitor of p53.
The direct mechanism is through DAPK1 phosphorylation
of tetrameric p53 on Ser20, which is located within the
transactivation domain that binds p300, leading to p53
activation and apoptosis [4, 5]. In addition, the DAPK1
gene is a transcriptional target of p53 and, therefore, may be
part of a positive feedback loop controlling p53 activation
and apoptosis [6]. However, DAPK1 may also facilitate
apoptosis independent of p53, and is an essential component
in several cell death signalling pathways (Figure 1). Because
of its ability to sensitize cells to many of the apoptotic
signals that are encountered during malignant transformation
DAPK1 is considered to be a tumour suppressor gene [7].
DAPK1 has also been shown to be regulated at the
transcriptional and translational levels by methylation of
its promoter CpG island and by microRNAs, respectively
[8]. In several haematological malignancies, including
DLBCL, DAPK1 undergoes DNA methylation-mediated
silencing during tumorigenesis. The frequency of
DAPK1 methylation in DLBCL patients is relatively
high, but varies somewhat from study to study [9–12].
We have previously shown that almost 90% of DLBCL
patients have detectable DAPK1 methylation [13]. Some
controversy exists in the literature whether or not DAPK1
methylation is a prognostic factor in DLBCL [10–13].
This may be explained by the studied cohorts being small
and/or not uniformly treated.
Mutations in the TP53 gene have been shown
to confer a negative effect on survival in DLBCL
[14]. Moreover, several studies have shown that TP53
disruption in combination with other molecular alterations

Figure 1: DAPK1 activation leads to apoptosis. Various stimuli such as cytokine signalling (e.g. Fas, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), oncogene

activation, and detachment from extracellular matrix, may lead to DAPK1 activation, which leads to apoptosis independent of p53

(Table 2). Therefore, these baseline risk factors were
included in the Cox proportional hazard model (Table 3). The
model identified methylation of DAPK1 as an independent
prognostic factor for predicting disease-specific survival, in
addition to elevated LDH. The hazard ratio was larger for
DAPK1 methylation (8.4, 95% CI was 1.13 to 62.88) than
for elevated LDH (4.58, 95% CI was 1.78 to 11.83), but the
confidence interval was also wider for DAPK1 methylation.

One-hundred and two of the 119 DLBCL patient
samples analysed were methylated (85.7%). Only one of
the patients having an unmethylated tumour sample died
during the follow-up period. Thus, DAPK1 methylation
was associated with shorter overall survival (Figure 2A)
and disease-specific survival (Figure 2B). Apparently, this
association was not statistically significant in our previous
study [13] due to a limited sample size and follow-up time.

Multivariate analysis of disease-specific survival

Overall- and disease-specific survival analysis
according to allelic DAPK1 methylation patterns

This analysis was performed for the 49 DLBCL
patients who were methylated and heterozygous for the
rs13300553 SNP. In this patient group univariate analysis
revealed that disease-specific survival was significantly
shortened in patients with elevated LDH (p<0.001) and
high IPI score (p=0.001). Therefore, these two baseline risk
factors were included in the Cox proportional hazard model.
In the multivariate analysis only elevated LDH remained as
an independent factor predicting disease-specific survival.
On the other hand IPI score and monoallelic methylation
of the A-allele did not stand out as independent prognostic
factors in this patient group (Table 3).

Genotyping of the rs13300553 SNP was successful
for 109 of the samples. No association was observed
between individual genotypes and overall- or disease
specific survival in this study (Supplementary Figure 1A
and 1B). Fifty-eight of the patients were heterozygous,
and pyrosequencing was used to assess their allelic
methylation patterns. This was successful for 57 of
the samples. Twenty-five were methylated on both
alleles, 13 were methylated only on the G-allele, 11
were methylated only on the A-allele, and eight were
unmethylated (representative results are shown in Figure
3). It was observed that monoallelic methylation of the
A-allele was associated with shorter overall survival
(Figure 4C) and disease-specific survival (Figure 4D).
There was no difference in survival between patients
methylated on the G-allele and patients methylated
on both alleles (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). In
addition, there was no difference in survival between
patients being methylated and homozygous AA and
patients being methylated and homozygous GG (data
not shown).

Allele-specific- and quantitative expression
analyses of DAPK1
DAPK1 expression levels and allele-specific
expression were assessed for 24 DLBCL samples. Fourteen
of these samples were heterozygous for the rs3818584 SNP
used to assess allele-specific expression. All fourteen of
these samples clearly expressed both alleles as assessed
by HRM (representative results are shown in Figure 5A).
Eight random samples were selected for confirmation of the
HRM results by pyrosequencing, and these analyses gave
the same result for all samples (data not shown). Nine of
the samples heterozygous for the rs3818584 SNP were also
heterozygous for the rs13300553 SNP used to assess allelic
methylation patterns, and three of these were methylated
only on one allele. Overall, sixteen of the 24 samples were

however, the pyrosequencing results were uncertain due

TP53 mutation status was obtained for 117 of the
DLBCL patients (Supplementary Table 1), and 30 were
shown to carry a TP53 mutation (25.6%). Patients with a
TP53 mutation had an inferior overall- and disease-specific
survival compared to wild-type patients, however, this
was not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure 3A

DAPK1 and the reference gene, PUM1.
In this study DAPK1 methylation was not statistically
significantly associated with overall survival despite none
of the patients without DAPK1 methylation died during
the follow-up period. Because of these limitations, and
because R-CHOP is now standard treatment for patients
with DLBCL we increased the cohort to a total of 119
uniformly treated patients with additional follow-up time
to investigate whether DAPK1 methylation can predict
overall- and disease-specific survival in DLBCL. Similar
to previous studies we used MSP for the detection of
DAPK1 methylation. However, since MSP is prone to
false-positive results [20–23], we used pyrosequencing to
confirm all positive results.
Our results confirm the potential of DAPK1
methylation as a prognostic marker in DLBCL treated
with R-CHOP, as it was associated with shorter overall
survival (p=0.017) and disease-specific survival (p=0.023).
In multivariate analysis DAPK1 methylation remained
an independent prognostic factor for predicting diseasespecific survival (p=0.038). Furthermore, we observed that,
among methylated individuals, monoallelic methylation of
the A-allele of the rs13300553 SNP was associated with
inferior overall survival (p<0.001) and disease-specific

to low peak heights (Supplementary Figure 4B). Also, the
methylation specific PCR resulted in a weak band when
performing gel electrophoresis for this sample, indicating
that the methylation level was low. Therefore, precise
quantification of the methylated alleles was difficult for
this sample. No association between overall- and diseasespecific survival according to DAPK1 methylation was
observed within this patient cohort (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
It has been postulated that DAPK1 methylation
is likely to be a prognostic factor that could be used in
conjunction with the conventional prognostic factors such
as the IPI score [10]. However, another study did not
find a correlation between methylation status of DAPK1
and the prognosis of DLBCL patients [11]. Common
for these two studies is that the patient cohorts were
relatively small (46 and 53 patients, respectively), and not
all patients received treatment with rituximab. We have
also previously analysed DAPK1 methylation patterns in
a cohort of 74 uniformly treated DLBCL patients [13].

methylated resulting in a constitutional epimutation [24].
This has for instance been observed for the MSH2 gene
in families with Lynch syndrome [25], and, interestingly,
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) allele-specific
expression of DAPK1 has been shown to occur in
non-malignant cells in more than 10% of CLL cases
but not in a healthy control population. Moreover, this
finding was associated with earlier onset (p=0.044)
suggesting a potential mechanism for predisposition
to CLL [26, 27]. Wei and colleagues also showed that
allele-specific expression is correlated with elevated

survival (p<0.001) as compared to the other possible
allelic methylation patterns. This is consistent with the
finding that monoallelic methylation of the A-allele was
associated with elevated LDH (p=0.007), suggesting that
DLBCL with monoallelic methylation of the A-allele are
more aggressive. These observations were surprising as we
hypothesized that biallelic methylation would be a more
severe event compared to monoallelic methylation.
A possible explanation for this phenomenon
could be that the rs13300553 SNP or another genetic
alteration acting in cis, predispose the allele to become

DAPK1 methylation was not associated with inferior
survival in this patient cohort. Thus, DAPK1 methylation
may play different roles in the tumorigenesis of different
haematological malignancies.
DAPK1 methylation and TP53 mutation status
have not previously been investigated simultaneously in
a single cohort of DLBCL patients and associated with
survival. In our study, patients carrying both DAPK1
methylation and a TP53 mutation had an inferior overalland disease-specific survival compared to patients carrying
only DAPK1 methylation, however, this was borderline
statistically significant. Furthermore, we did not observe
a significant correlation between DAPK1 methylation
and TP53 mutations, and TP53 mutation status was not
significantly associated with overall- or disease-specific
survival within this patient cohort. These observations
comply with the findings that DAPK1 may facilitate
apoptosis both dependent and independent of p53, and
two previous studies of DAPK1 methylation and TP53
mutations in non-small cell lung cancer also found no
associations between these molecular events [30, 31].
In conclusion, we found that DAPK1 methylation
is associated with poor overall- and disease-specific
survival in a large cohort of DLBCL patients uniformly
treated with rituximab. This finding remained statistically
significant in multivariate analyses. Moreover, methylation
of the A-allele of the rs13300553 SNP was associated with
inferior overall- and disease-specific survival in DLBCL.
Germline allele-specific expression of DAPK1 is unlikely
to be responsible for the inferior survival associated
with methylation of the A-allele. Finally, DLBCL with
combined TP53 mutation and DAPK1 methylation is
likely to be another “double hit” lymphoma with very poor
outcome.

methylation levels in CLL [27], however, it is unlikely
that a genetic alteration acting in cis predispose the allele
to become methylated as no genetic aberrations could be
identified in spite of extensive upstream and downstream
sequencing [27]. We analysed allele-specific expression of
DAPK1 in 14 DLBCL samples from patients heterozygous
for the rs3818584 SNP using HRM analysis of RT-qPCR
products containing this SNP. In spite several of these
patients carried monoallelic methylation, we observed
a robust expression from both alleles in all samples.
However, the signal is likely to be derived from normal
cells within the tissue sections. Therefore, we believe that
germline allele-specific expression is unlikely to play a
significant role in DLBCL pathogenesis. Furthermore,
we did not observe any associations between allelic
methylation patterns and age at the time of diagnosis.
When analysing the genotypes of the rs13300553
SNP it could be observed that, within this patient cohort,
it did not influence survival by itself, and it does not affect
the amino acid sequence of DAPK1. Therefore, we do
not believe that the A-allele by itself influence survival of
DLBCL patients.
Another possible explanation could be that the
combination of having an A at the position of the
rs13300553 SNP in combination with a methylated allele
affects the binding of specific proteins and/or nucleosome
positioning at the DAPK1 promoter region. We were,
however, not able to study these possibilities as none of
the DLBCL cell lines we have screened for allelic DAPK1
methylation patterns carried monoallelic methylation
[13], but we observed that DAPK1 was expressed at
similar levels in samples from patients with monoallelic
methylation and patients with biallelic methylation.
However, as the tissue sections also contain normal cells,
and precise estimation of tumour cell content is difficult
[28], it is likely that potential differences remain undetected
in a background of normal cells expressing DAPK1. In
addition, it is likely that the tumour cells are heterogeneous
with respect to DAPK1 methylation and expression, which
would also confound the expression analysis. Finally,
DAPK1 may also be downregulated by other mechanisms
such as microRNA mediated mRNA destruction.
In the multivariate analysis monoallelic methylation
of the A-allele did not remain as an independent
prognostic factor for predicting disease-specific survival
(p=0.07). Also, it was observed that more patients carrying
monoallelic methylation of the A-allele were male and had
a bad performance score. However, the observed survival
differences cannot be solely explained by these factors.
To further investigate a potential role of carrying
monoallelic methylation of the A-allele in hematologic
cancer, we studied 67 samples from patients with multiple
myeloma as DAPK1 has previously been shown to
undergo methylation mediated silencing in this disease
[29]. Interestingly, all of the methylated and heterozygous
myeloma samples carried biallelic methylation and

62 of the patients, respectively. Additional cases were
subsequently collected and analyzed for these two
molecular aberrations. The clinical follow-up period for
each patient was also prolonged in this study. In total
the cohort comprised of 119 DLBCL cases all receiving
immunotherapy with rituximab. The diagnoses were
based on standard histology and immunophenotyping
according to the 2008 WHO classification. The fraction
of tumor cells was more than 50% of the total tissue for
all samples, and more than 80% for the samples used for
expression studies. Cause of death was available for all
patients except three. These three patients most likely
died from their disease and were analyzed as such. In

addition, 67 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma
were included in the present study. From these patients
freshly isolated mononuclear cells from the bone marrow
were used for isolation of CD138+ plasma cells on a
RoboSep (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).
DNA isolation and subsequent bisulfite conversion were
performed as described [13].
The project has been approved by the regional
ethics committee (De Videnskabsetiske Komitéer, Region
Hovedstaden), as a register project according to the Danish
ethical regulations, and informed consent was provided for
each multiple myeloma patient sample.

microRNAs as well as total RNA, according to the
manufacturers’ protocol including DNAase treatment.
From each sample 250 ng RNA was used for cDNA
synthesis, which was performed using the SuperScript®
III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturers’ protocol. The cDNA was
diluted 1:10 before real-time PCR. The LightCycler®
480 instrument II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was
used for the real-time PCR and high-resolution melting
(HRM). The High Resolution Melting Master (Roche)
was used at a final concentration of 1X, with 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 200 nM of each primer, and 5 µL of diluted
cDNA resulting in a total volume of 20 µL. The cycling
protocol started with one cycle of 95°C for 10 min,
followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 10 s,
and 72°C for 10s, 1 cycle of 95°C for 1 min, 1 cycle of
40°C for 1 min, and a melting step from 65°C to 95°C
with 30 acquisitions per °C. All reactions were done in
duplicate. The sequences of the DAPK1 primers were;
forward: 5’ Biotin-CAGGGGCTACCACGACAT 3’
and reverse: 5’ AGGGCAATGTGTCCGTCCTT 3’.
The reverse primer was designed to overlap an exonexon junction to prevent amplification of potentially
contaminating genomic DNA. The forward primer was
biotin labelled to allow confirmation of the HRM data
by pyrosequencing, using the PyroMark Q24 (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturers’ protocol, with the
following sequencing primer: 5’ GCTTGCGACAAGGAC
3’. The samples were genotyped for the rs3818584 SNP
using the same forward primer as above and reverse: 5’
CCATAAGGCACCTTGTCGCAA 3’ using the PyroMark
Q24 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers’ protocol.
For the quantitative analyses the PUM1 gene
was used for normalization as this gene has previously
been shown to be stably expressed in lymphoid
tissue [32]. The primer sequences were; forward:
5’ CATGCCAGGTTATCCGGTGT 3’ and reverse:
5’ GCGCCTGCATTCACTACAAG 3’. The same
concentrations of reagents and LightCycler protocol were
used as described above. The data were expressed as
relative quantities (2-ΔCt) using the average of the Ct-value
from each of the duplicates. The highest possible estimate
for DAPK1 expression for each sample was obtained by
using the lowest DAPK1 Ct-value and the highest PUM1
Ct-value to generate the ΔCt-value, and vice versa for the
lowest possible estimates.

Allelic MSP-pyrosequencing
The DAPK1 MSP primers were designed to target
the sense strand and amplify the region surrounding the
rs13300553 SNP (A/G). Several non-CpG cytosines in
each of the primers select against the amplification of
incompletely converted molecules. Additional CpG sites
and non-CpG cytosines in between the primers serve as
a control for the amplification of methylated and bisulfite
converted template, respectively. An assay specific for
unmethylated DAPK1 sequences was designed to target
the same region to verify that negative samples were
negative because they were unmethylated and not because
the DNA was lost during bisulfite conversion. Genotyping
the rs13300553 SNP was done using M-13 tagged DAPK1
specific PCR primers and sequenced using Sanger
sequencing. The primer sequences have been published
previously [13]. PCR cycling was performed on the Gene
PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The cycling
protocols and concentrations of the reagents used have
been published [13]. The PCR amplified DNA was run
on 2% agarose gels and sequenced on the PyroMark Q24
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. The
same criteria for scoring the samples were applied as in
our previous publication [13].

Detection of TP53 mutations
The coding sequences and splice sites of exons 5–9
of the TP53 gene were scanned for mutations by PCR
and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
By covering exon 5–9 it is expected that about 90% of
TP53 mutations will be detected [14]. All mutations were
confirmed in a second round of PCR from the original
sample, and positive samples were subjected to Sanger
sequencing as described [15].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS
19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.). Associations between
DAPK1 methylation and TP53 mutations were assessed
using a Fisher’s exact test. Correlations between
overall survival and disease specific survival and
TP53 mutation status and DAPK1 methylation status
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with

the use of a log-rank test. The clinical characteristics
and treatment outcomes were compared according to
TP53 mutation status and DAPK1 methylation status
using one-way ANOVA, Person ­­chi-squared tests, or
Fisher’s exact tests when expected values were below
five. For assessment of independent predictors of disease
specific survival a multivariate Cox regression hazard
model with backward stepwise (likelihood ratio) entry
was applied. Effects not meeting a p-value< 0.05 in
univariate analyses were removed from the model. Any
differences were considered to be statistically significant
when the p-value was <0.05.
