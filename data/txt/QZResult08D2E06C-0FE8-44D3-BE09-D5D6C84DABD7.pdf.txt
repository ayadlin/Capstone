BACKGROUND: Various trials have reported improved outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) who received treatment with pediatric-based regimens. Those reports prompted the current investigation of the pedi€nster (ABFM) regimen in AYA patients. The results were compared with those from a similar popatric augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Mu
ulation that received the hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen.
METHODS: Eighty-five patients ages 12 to 40 years who had Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative ALL received the ABFM regimen from October 2006 through April 2012. Their outcome was compared with outcomes in 71 historic AYA patients who received
hyper-CVAD from the authors’ institution. Patient and disease characteristics, as well as minimal residual disease status, were analyzed for their impact on outcomes. RESULTS: The complete response rate with ABFM was 94%. The 3-year complete remission duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 70% and 74%, respectively. For patients aged 21 years, the 3-year CRD and OS rates
were 72% and 85%, respectively; and, for patients ages 21 to 40 years, the respective rates were 69% and 60%. The initial white blood
cell count was an independent predictive factor of OS and CRD. The minimal residual disease status on days 29 and 84 of therapy
also were predictive of long-term outcomes. Severe regimen toxicities included transient hepatotoxicity in 35% to 39% of patients,
pancreatitis in 11% of patients, osteonecrosis in 11% of patients, and thrombosis in 22% of patients. The 3-year OS rate was 74% in the
ABFM group versus 71% in the hyper-CVAD group, and the corresponding 3-year CRD rate was 70% versus 66%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: ABFM was tolerable in AYA patients with ALL but was not associated with significant improvements in CRD and OS

INTRODUCTION
In retrospective comparisons, the outcomes of adolescent and young adults (AYA) with acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL) treated on pediatric protocols have been superior to the outcomes of similar patients treated on adult protocols.1-4
An exception is the study by Usvasalo et al,5 who observed no difference in outcomes between adult and pediatric-based
treatments. Several studies have investigated pediatric-based regimens in adults with ALL up to age 55 years.6-8 Older
adults (ages 40 to 45 years) had significantly worse toxicities with pediatric-based regimens.7 Nachman and colleagues
demonstrated that the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-M€
unster (ABFM) regimen could be administered successfully to
patients up to age 21 years and was associated with very favorable survival, particularly in patients who had a rapid
response to induction therapy.9
To improve the outcome of AYAs with ALL at our institution, ABFM therapy was investigated in newly diagnosed
patients aged 40 years who had Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-negative ALL. This regimen was chosen because of the
success of ABFM therapy in treating AYAs ages 16 to 21 years and its acceptable toxicity profile. Herein, we report our
results using ABFM and compare the outcomes of patients who received ABFM with those from a similar historic AYA

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group

Patients with Ph chromosome-negative ALL ages 12 to 30
years were initially enrolled. After evaluating toxicities in
the first 10 patients, the upper age limit was expanded to
40 years. The diagnosis of ALL was confirmed by bone

marrow morphology and flow cytometry. Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 3 and adequate renal and
hepatic functions (unless the abnormalities were attributed to leukemia). Steroid treatment before enrollment
initially was limited to 3 days, but this restriction was
removed later. The protocol was approved by the MD
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and
informed consent for therapy was obtained according to
the Declaration of Helsinki and our institutional
guidelines.
Treatment

Treatment details are provided in Table 1 and have been
previously published.10 Chemotherapy started within 72
hours of the first intrathecal chemotherapy. Bone marrow
was reassessed at day 15. Patients who had <5% bone
marrow blasts by day 15 were treated in the rapidresponder group, which received 1 consolidation 1 phase
and 1 consolidation 3A/3B phase of therapy. Slow responding patients received 2 consolidation 1 phases and 2 consolidation 3A/3B blocks of therapy. Patients who had >5%
bone marrow blasts on day 29 received 2 weeks of extended
induction. At the end of the extended induction, patients
who had >5% bone marrow blasts were taken off study.
Early responders received 12 intrathecal therapies (ITs),
whereas slow responders received 16 ITs. Patients with
overt leukemia in the spinal fluid received treatment with
intensified ITs (see Table 1). Radiation for overt central
nervous system (CNS) leukemia was recommended.
Wright-Giemsa staining was used to assess routine
morphology and the percentage of bone marrow blasts.
Myeloperoxidase immunohistochemistry and 4-color
flow cytometry were performed. Rapid fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) was used to establish preliminary Ph chromosome status using breakpoint cluster
region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCRABL) probes. Rapid Ph chromosome testing was corroborated with conventional cytogenetics and polymerase
chain reaction testing. Bone marrow morphology and
minimal residual disease (MRD) status were assessed on
day 29 and on approximately day 84 of treatment. B-cell
markers included cluster of differentiation 9 (CD9),
CD10, CD13, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, and
CD58 (sensitivity, 1024). MRD status in the patients
with T-cell morphology was followed using a panel of
T-cell markers that included CD1, CD2, CD3 (surface
and cytoplasmic), CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, and CD 10.
Standard cytogenetic studies were evaluated at diagnosis
and on days 29 and 84 of therapy. Polymerase chain

reaction analyses for t(12;21), BCR-ABL, and myeloid/
lymphoid (mixed-lineage) leukemia (MLL) rearrangements were performed at diagnosis (LTx assay; Asuragen,
Inc., Austin, Tex). Spinal fluid was assessed for malignant
cells using cytopathology and Coulter counting. CNS disease status was defined according to pediatric ALL guidelines.11 During the course of the study, the pegylated
(PEG)-asparaginase dose was capped at 3750 U, which is
the content of 1 vial. This dose was adopted because of the
expense of individual vials and to avoid excessive toxicities
from PEG-asparaginase.
Response Criteria and Toxicity

A complete response (CR) was defined as <5% bone marrow blasts and a normal peripheral blood count. Induction deaths included all deaths before day 29 of treatment
(day 42 if the patient received extended induction).
Patients who had >5% bone marrow blasts at day 42
were removed from the study. Relapse was defined as a recurrence of ALL at any site. Toxicities were defined
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0.
Statistical Considerations

The endpoints of this single-institution trial of ABFM
therapy were the CR, complete remission duration
(CRD), and overall survival (OS) rates. The CRD was
measured from the date of CR until relapse. Differences in
CR rates were analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher
exact tests. Unadjusted CRD and OS analyses were eval3662

uated using Kaplan-Meier plots,12 and the characteristics
associated with differences in CRD and OS were assessed
using the log-rank test.13 Cox proportional-hazards regression14 was used to evaluate factors that predicted CRD
and OS. Factors that had P values .10 in univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate analysis. We
observed that the MRD status on days 29 and 84 or later
were collinear and could not be included in the same
model. Therefore, we constructed separate models to assess
the effect of MRD status separately on day 29 and day 84.
A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM PASW
Statistics 19 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Patient Study Group

In total, 85 patients between ages 12 and 40 years with
newly diagnosed, Ph chromosome-negative ALL received
treatment with ABFM (Table 2). The median follow-up
was 40 months (range, 4-70 months). ALL morphology
was pre-B-cell in 69 patients and T-cell in 16 patients.
Nine percent of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2, and no patients
had a performance status 3. Forty percent of patients
had a diploid karyotype. The karyotype was hyperdiploid
in 20% of patients aged 21 years and in 18% of
patients aged 21 years. Seven patients had CNS blasts
at diagnosis on cytopathology review; only 1 patient had
CNS 3 (WBC  5/microliter and blasts present). Three
patients had Down syndrome.

Treatment Results

Overall, 80 of 85 patients (94%) achieved a CR (Table 3).
There was 1 induction death because of sepsis. One
patient with trisomy 21 died of sepsis while in CR after
completing induction, and 1 patient with Down syndrome died of multiorgan failure, also secondary to sepsis,
after completing consolidation 1.
Twenty-five patients have relapsed, and 14 of them
have died. Eighteen of the relapsed patients were rapid
early responders. Eight patients died in CR, including 4
who died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Seven patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first morphologic CR, including 2 patients
aged 21 years. Reasons for transplantation included
slow clearance of MRD or high-risk cytogenetic findings,
such as MLL gene rearrangement. Four of the 7 patients
who underwent transplantation have died, 2 remain in
CR, and 1 patient is alive with relapsed disease.
Cancer

The rapid response rate according to bone marrow
morphology on day 15 was 76% (80% in patients aged
21 years and 73% in patients aged >21 years; P value
not significant). Isolated CNS relapse occurred in 6
patients (7%), and 3 patients (4%) had a relapse in the
spinal fluid and bone marrow. Sixteen patients (19%)
patients had a bone marrow relapse alone. The median
time to relapse was 21.9 months in patients aged 21
years and 11.5 months in patients aged >21 years.

December 1, 2014

Sixty patients (71%) remained alive with at a median
follow-up of 40 months (range, 4-75 months). The overall 3-year OS and CRD rates were 74% and 70%, respectively. The 3-year OS and CRD rates were 85% and 72%,
respectively, for patients aged 21 years and 60% and
69%, respectively, for patients aged >21 years (Fig.
1A,B). The difference in the 3-year OS rates for the 2 age
groups had borderline significance (P5.055).
Outcome by MRD Status

The outcome of patients according to MRD status is
detailed in Table 3. The 3-year OS rate was 82% for patients
who had MRD-negative status on day 29 versus 65% for
those who had MRD-positive status on day 29 (P5.02)
(Fig. 1C). The 3-year CRD rate was 75% for patients who
had MRD-negative status on day 29 versus 59% for those
who had MRD-positive status on day 29 (P5.2) (Fig. 1D).
The 3-year OS rate was 83% for patients who had
MRD-negative status on day 84 versus 66% for those who
had MRD-positive status on day 84 (P5.02), and the corresponding CRD rates were 82% versus 20%, respectively
(p5.01) (Table 3). The results within age groups are provided in Table 3.
Prognostic Factors

On univariate analysis, the following factors were adverse
for OS (P.10): day-29 and day-84 MRD-positive status,
leukocytosis >503109/L, older age (continuous variable)
(Fig. 1A), and slow responder status. There were interactions between age and MRD status. On multivariate analysis, only leukocytosis (P.001) and day-28 MRD-positive
status (P5.05) retained an adverse, independent association with survival. In a second model, we included MRD
status on day 84, age, white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, response type (rapid vs slow), and cytogenetics
(diploid vs not diploid). Only the WBC count at diagnosis
was independently associated with OS (P5.003).
On univariate analysis, the following factors were
adverse for CRD (P.10): day-84 MRD-positive status

and leukocytosis >503109/L (Fig. 2B). On multivariate
analysis, only leukocytosis remained independently
adverse (P5.04).
Comparison of ABFM and Hyper-CVAD

Details of the hyper-CVAD regimen and results from its
use were published previously.15 In the current comparison, we included only patients aged 40 years. Among 71
such patients, 37 (52%) had CD20-positive expression on
20% leukemia cells (median, 77% of leukemia cells;
range, 25%-99% of leukemia cells) and received rituximab 375 mg/m2 for 8 doses in the first 4 inductionconsolidation cycles.
In a comparison between ABFM and hyper-CVAD,
there were no statistically significant differences in the CR
rate (ABFM, 94% CR rate; hyper-CVAD, 99% CR rate
[70 of 71 patients]) or in CRD or OS rates between the
2 treatment regimens (Fig. 2C,D). The 3-year OS rate was
74% with ABFM versus 71% with hyper-CVAD, and the
3664

3-year CRD rate was 70% with ABFM versus 66% with
hyper-CVAD. When OS and CRD were further analyzed
in multivariate analyses that included age, presenting WBC
count, and MRD status at the end of induction therapy, no
statistically significant differences in outcome were detected
between the treatment regimens (data not shown).
Regimen Toxicities

Toxicities associated with the ABFM regimen, particularly hepatic toxicity, were significant but expected
(Table 4). Grade 3 and 4 hyperbilirubinemia was observed
in 39% of patients, and grade 3 and 4 liver enzyme elevations were observed in 35%. Liver toxicity resolved in
most patients but resulted in chemotherapy dose decrements and omissions according to protocol guidelines.
Hypofibrinogenemia was prominent (36%) but did not
result in excessive bleeding. Thrombosis, mostly in the
upper extremities in which central lines were located,
occurred in 22% of patients, and stroke-like events

developed in 3 patients. Toxicities that led to permanent
changes in therapy consisted of osteonecrosis (11% of
patients), severe allergy to PEG-asparaginase (21% of
patients), and pancreatitis (11% of patients). The incidence of osteonecrosis was comparable to that reported
previously in adolescents who were treated on pediatric
trials.10 A higher incidence of severe asparaginase allergy
was noted on study compared with that reported in the
pediatric literature.16 Neuropathy was not prominent:
only 4 patients had vincristine held because of grade 3
neuropathy. Infections and febrile episodes during
induction and later in therapy were common and did not
differ significantly between the age groups. Fever or
documented infections were noted in 22% of patients
during induction and in 63% of patients during
consolidations.

DISCUSSION
In this experience in AYA patients with newly diagnosed
ALL, the ABFM regimen resulted in a CR rate of 94%, a
3-year OS rate of 74%, and a CRD rate of 70%. Severe
toxicities of the regimen were significant but expected and
mostly were related to PEG-asparaginase–based therapy.
These included hepatotoxicity in 35% to 39% of patients,
pancreatitis in 11% of patients, osteonecrosis in 11% of
patients, and thrombotic events in 22% of patients.
The results from this trial were compared retrospectively with historic data on the hyper-CVAD regimen in a
similar population at our institution in relation to CR,
OS, and CRD. The 2 populations—those who received
ABFM and those who received hyper-CVAD—were well
matched (Table 2). The patients who received hyperCVAD were older (age range, 16-40 years; median age,
26 years; P<.001). Presenting WBC count, performance
status, and blast phenotype did not differ statistically
between the 2 groups. Despite the older age (a known
adverse prognostic factor in ALL) in the hyper-CVAD
group, the efficacy results were similar for ABFM and
hyper-CVAD, but the toxicity profiles were different (asparaginase-related with ABFM, myelosuppression with
hyper-CVAD). Thus, it is reasonable to extrapolate that
other “adult ALL” regimens were inferior to “pediatric”
regimens, because they may have mimicked more adult
acute myelogenous leukemia-like regimens, including
reliance on allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation in first CR, fewer consolidations, shorter maintenance durations, and less intrathecal chemotherapy. The
hyper-CVAD regimen maintained the core principles of
the pediatric ALL regimens but reduced reliance on asparaginase.17 Therefore, the current shift to pediatric-based
therapy for AYA patients with ALL, especially those aged
21 years, may need further assessment.
A high WBC count at presentation remained an independent predictor of OS in multivariate analysis. Historically, patients with T-cell ALL may present with high
WBC counts and yet may have an acceptable OS.18 The
T-cell ALL group in our study was too small to analyze
the relative importance of morphology and WBC count.
However, AYA patients with pre-B ALL and leukocytosis
should be considered for additional intensifications (eg,
allogeneic stem cell transplantation) or novel strategies
(eg, new monoclonal antibodies).
Molecular or flow cytometry studies measuring
MRD have strongly predicted for relapse in pediatric ALL
studies.19-25 In AYAs with ALL, MRD status at the end of
induction therapy also has been associated with differences in survival.26,27 In our study, a negative MRD status
3666

by multicolor flow cytometry on days 29 and day 84 was
associated with improved survival (Table 3). A similar
effect of MRD on prognosis was noted with the hyperCVAD regimen.15 Thus, patients with positive MRD status in CR may be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation or for novel therapies while in first
morphologic CR.28
Concerns over toxicities of pediatric-based therapies
are legitimate and mostly asparaginase-related: in the current study, these included hepatotoxicity (35%-39% of
patients), pancreatitis (11% of patients), osteonecrosis
(11% of patients), and thrombosis (22% of patients). Infectious complications during prolonged steroid administration may be problematic. Infectious death during
induction occurred in 1 patient, a death rate comparable
to that reported in other studies among children and
adults during ALL therapy.29,30 There were 8 deaths in
CR, including 2 deaths in patients with Down syndrome
and 4 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All
patients received antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis
during periods of severe neutropenia. Avascular necrosis
appears to be less prominent in AYAs up to age 40 years
than in teen-aged patients.31,32 Hypofibrinogenemia,
although frequent, did not cause bleeding. The rate of
thrombosis was higher than reported in pediatric
patients,33 and most thrombi were related to central lines.
The rate of CNS relapse in this study was similar to
the rates in published pediatric and adult studies, yet the
number of intrathecal treatments was less than in prior pediatric trials of ABFM.9 Intrathecal therapy has side
effects, such as impaired cognitive function, seizures, and
white matter damage. Decreased intrathecal treatments
may be feasible and beneficial to AYA patients in future
treatment regimens.
Adherence to therapy may limit the effectiveness of
chemotherapy.34,35 Noncompliance may be related to age
group or to the complexity and length of treatments.
Several AYAs in the current study (n510; 12%) withdrew
from treatment. Older adults on even simpler regimens
for leukemia still have issues with compliance,36 and AYA
patients may be even less compliant.37 Breaks in therapy
because of toxicities also occurred in our patients. Such
deviations in therapy undermine cure rates in children
with ALL.38 One in 5 patients had a severe allergic reaction to PEG-asparaginase. Decreases in planned doses of
asparaginase result in decreased event-free survival.39 In
this study, patients switched to Erwinia asparaginase after
severe allergic reactions to PEG-asparaginase, a strategy
that has resulted in effective asparagine depletion in
patients with allergic reactions to Escherichia coli

asparaginase.40 Approximately 10% of patients on this
study developed pancreatitis, an incidence similar to that
reported in children.41 These patients did not receive further asparaginase.
In summary, AYA patients with ALL who received
treatment with ABFM had high OS and CRD rates and
tolerated this pediatric regimen with acceptable toxicity.
The OS and CRD rates were comparable to those
obtained with hyper-CVAD, an adult leukemia regimen.
