Abstract:

Proteotoxic stress (PS) is generated in cells under a variety of conditions involving
accumulation of misfolded proteins. To avoid the toxicity of unmitigated PS, cells
activate the heat shock response (HSR). HSR involves upregulation of factors
such as ubiquitin and the non-housekeeping chaperone Hsp70 which assist
with metabolism of aberrant proteins. The PS-HSR axis is a potential anticancer
treatment target since many tumor cells display constitutive PS and dependence
on HSR due to their rapid rates of proliferation and translation. In fact, induction of
PS via stimulation of protein misfolding (hyperthermia), inhibition of proteasomes
(bortezomib) or inhibition of Hsp90 (geldanamycin) have all been considered
or used for cancer treatment. We found that combination of bortezomib with an
inducer of protein misfolding (hyperthermia or puromycin) resulted in enhanced
PS. HSR was also induced, but could not mitigate the elevated PS and the cells
died via largely p53-independent apoptosis. Thus, combination treatments were
more cytotoxic in vitro than the component single treatments. Consistent with this,
combination of non-toxic doses of puromycin with bortezomib significantly increased
the antitumor activity of bortezomib in a mouse model of multiple myeloma.
These results provide support for using combination treatments that disrupt the
balance of PS and HSR to increase the therapeutic index of anticancer therapies.

Introduction

synthesized to assist in metabolism of misfolded proteins,
ubiquitin is upregulated to allow for more proteasomemediated degradation, and general translation is
attenuated [5,6]. In mammalian cells, the adaptive HSR
depends upon activation of the transcription factor HSF1
[7]. HSF1 is required for expression of the inducible form
of Hsp70 as well as other chaperones and some stressrelated transcription factors [1].
Many tumors and tumor-derived cells contain
elevated levels of misfolded proteins due to the high
level of translation associated with their rapid rate of
proliferation, as well as specific intracellular conditions,
such as glycolysis-related acidification [8,9]. Therefore,

Proteotoxic stress (PS) is generated by accumulation
of misfolded proteins in cells under a variety of conditions
including hyperthermia, hypoxia, and exposure to
denaturing agents or drugs that inhibit proteasome or
chaperone activities [1-3]. PS can be toxic if misfolded
proteins accumulate and aggregate in the cells. To avoid
the toxicity of PS, cells activate an adaptive response,
known as the heat shock response (HSR)[4].
The adaptive HSR involves induction of factors and
pathways that serve to mitigate the burden of misfolded
proteins. Thus, additional chaperones (e.g., Hsp70) are

these tumor cells exist under conditions of constant PS
and exhibit constitutive activation of HSR. The elevated
expression in tumors of both “housekeeping” heat shock
proteins (HSP) such as the chaperone Hsp90 and the
inducible form of Hsp70 is a reflection of their level of PS.
Thus, the ability to properly respond to PS is especially
important for survival of tumor cells. This is illustrated by
the finding that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of
Hsp70 synthesis in response to PS in tumor cells increased
the toxicity of PS and resulted in apoptosis [10-12]. In
addition, HSF1 knock-out mice showed reduced frequency
of tumor formation in response to oncogene expression
or exposure to oncogenic chemicals as compared to wild
type mice [13-14]. Thus, HSF1-related gene expression
represents a principal mechanism by which cancer cells
survive in the face of constant PS.
Since tumor cells are particularly prone to PS and,
thereby, dependent upon effective HSR, targeting of HSR
has been recognized as an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy. Previous studies have demonstrated that
it is possible to manipulate the toxicity of PS induced
by different stimuli, such as hyperthermia, proteasome
inhibitors and chaperone inhibitors to achieve greater
tumor cell killing. One way to increase the toxicity of
PS is to suppress the adaptive HSR by blocking Hsp70
synthesis. For example, we showed that the anti-malaria
drug quinacrine and its close analogue 9-amino-acridine
prevented PS-specific induction of Hsp70 and increased
the toxicity of PS for both tumor cells in vitro and tumors
in vivo [12]. Other studies demonstrated increased
cytotoxicity through combination of the Hsp90 inhibitor
geldanamycin with cisplatin (an inhibitor of HSF1 DNA
binding) [15] or combination of hyperthermia with
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsp70 [10]. In these
three studies, the first component of the combination
treatment is a PS inducer, while the latter component acts
as an inhibitor of HSR.
We proposed an alternative approach for increasing
the toxicity of PS in tumor cells based on the idea that the
HSR capacity of a cell is limited by the expression levels
of a small number of genes (e.g., those encoding inducible
chaperones, such as Hsp70 [3,7], and ubiquitin [16]). The
roles of chaperones and ubiquitin in protein metabolism
that lead to effective HSR require that they are available in
sufficient amounts to interact with most of the misfolded
protein molecules present in the cell [2]. Thus, although
HSR is highly inducible by PS and typically very effective,
we hypothesized that it might be possible to increase the
level of misfolded proteins such that it cannot be matched
by the cell’s HSR (capacity to synthesize chaperones and
ubiquitin). Such “enhanced proteotoxic stress” (EPS)
would be expected to be highly cytotoxic, especially
for tumor cells which are constitutively coping with
pre-existing PS. In this study, we show that EPS can be
generated through combination of a treatment that causes
misfolding of proteins (hyperthermia or puromycin) with

indicate that combined treatment with hyperthermia and
bortezomib produces EPS.
The EPS generated by hyperthermia+bortezomib
was not effectively mitigated by coincident induction
of HSR in co-treated cells, as illustrated by aggregation
of misfolded proteins in the cells (Fig. 2). Heat shock
treatment (1 hour at 43oC) of H1299 cells carrying an
HSF1-regulated GFP expression construct (H1299-HSE/
GFP) resulted in a high level of GFP expression which
was still evident 36 hours later (Fig. 2B). By 72 hours
after heat shock, most of the GFP protein was degraded
in cells that did not receive any further treatment (Fig.
2C, 2Ca), indicating effective HSR. In contrast, if the
heat-shocked H1299-HSE/GFP cells were incubated
in the presence of bortezomib for the subsequent 72
hours, GFP accumulated in aggresomes (Fig. 2D, 2Da).
These data suggest that the combination of an inducer of
protein misfolding (hyperthermia) with an inhibitor of
proteasomal degradation (bortezomib) produces a level
of PS that the cell cannot mitigate, even though HSR is
induced by the treatments as well.
We next determined whether EPS generated by
treatment with hyperthermia+bortezomib resulted in
enhanced cytotoxicity. Under conditions of standard PS,
such as that generated by bortezomib or hyperthermia
alone, the induced adaptive HSR is usually sufficient to
allow cell survival. For example, HT1080, HCT116 (data
not shown) and HeLa (Fig. 3A, B) cells can completely
recover from 1 hour incubation at 430C during additional
incubation at 37oC. Treatment with 40 nM of bortezomib
for 18 hours induces a similar level of PS (data not shown),
but was slightly more toxic to HeLa cells than hyperthermia
(Fig. 3A, B). This is likely due to the fact that proteasome
inhibition has other effects in addition to induction of
PS, such as causing accumulation of the pro-apoptotic

the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. We demonstrate
that simultaneous induction of protein misfolding and
inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation induces
EPS in several different types of tumor cells and leads
to cell death in vitro and suppression of tumor growth in
vivo. The tested drug combinations show greater efficacy
than either single component treatment, both in inducing
PS (generating EPS) and in killing tumor cells in vitro and
in vivo. These results indicate that such combinatorial PStargeting therapies hold substantial promise as improved
cancer treatments.

The objective of this study was to test whether we
could create EPS that would be cytotoxic in tumor cells
without direct inhibition of HSR. We hypothesized that the
severity of PS would be enhanced by combining a treatment
that induces protein misfolding, such as hyperthermia [17],
with a treatment that prevents degradation of misfolded
proteins, such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
[3]. Using inducible Hsp70 expression as a marker of
PS, we found that combined treatment with hyperthermia
and bortezomib resulted in a much higher level of PS
than either agent alone (Fig. 1A, B). As expected based
on the well-established relationship between Hsp70
expression and PS, we also observed much higher levels
of ubiquitinated proteins (presumably misfolded) in cells
treated with hyperthermia and bortezomib than in cells
treated with either agent alone (Fig. 1C). These data

factor p53 and suppressing the pro-survival activities of
NF-kappaB and Akt [18.19]. Nevertheless, both of the
above-described PS-inducing treatments (heat shock and
bortezomib) leave the majority of treated cells alive. In
contrast, we found that combination of the two treatments
resulted in a much higher level of cell death (Fig. 3A, B).
Analysis of PARP cleavage demonstrated that cell death
induced by hyperthermia+bortezomib is accompanied by
activation of caspases indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 3C).
These data demonstrate that the extent of cell death in cells
treated with hyperthermia+bortezomib correlated with
the increased level of PS generated by the combination
treatment (Fig. 1). This supports our hypothesis that
the cytotoxity of the combination treatment is due to
accumulation of misfolded proteins to a level that exceeds
the capacity of the cell’s natural adaptive HSR.

Like hyperthermia, some pharmacological agents
also induce proteins’ misfolding. For example, the
antibiotic puromycin, which acts as a non-functional
analogue of aminoacyl tRNA, causes premature
termination of translation and accumulation of aborted,
improperly folded translation products [20]. We therefore
hypothesized that puromycin, similar to hyperthermia,
would enhance the antitumor effect of bortezomib. As
shown in Figure 4, treatment of HT1080 tumor cells in
vitro with a combination of puromycin and bortezomib
caused greater PS and adaptive HSR than treatment with
either drug alone. The classic marker of adaptive HSR,
Hsp70, was upregulated to a greater extent at both the
protein (Fig. 4A) and mRNA (Fig. 4B) levels by the drug
combination as compared to either single drug. Notably,
induction of HSR (as judged by induction of Hsp70
expression) by puromycin was observed at a concentration
that does not cause suppression of general translation
(Fig. 4A). Similar effects of bortezomib, puromycin and
their combination on induction of HSR were observed in
HeLa cells carrying an Hsp70-regulated GFP expression
constructed (HSE/GFP) (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the
effects of puromycin+bortezomib on Hsp70, we found that
the combination treatment also led to greater accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins in HT1080 cells as compared to
treatment with either drug alone (Fig. 4C). Taken together,
these results indicate that combination of bortezomib with
puromycin (as with hyperthermia) generates EPS within
the treated cells.

puromycin+bortezomib treatment correlated with

HeLa HSE/GFP cells with 400 ng/ml puromycin and 40 nM
bortezomib for 18 hours resulted in significantly reduced
cell viability as compared to treatment with either drug

reduction in cell viability correlated with appearance of
morphological (small, rounded, detached cells (Fig.5A))
and biochemical (Fig. 5C) signs of apoptosis. These
data support our hypothesis that combination treatments
resulting in accumulation of misfolded proteins to levels
that exceed the salvaging capacity of HSR will lead to cell
death and demonstrate that such death proceeds, at least in
part, via apoptosis.

Inhibition of proteasome activity results in
stabilization and accumulation of the key pro-apoptotic
protein p53 [21]. To examine the involvement of p53 in
EPS-induced cytotoxicity, we used isogenic p53-/- and
p53 wild type HCT116 cell lines [22] and compared the
effects of nutlin-3a, an MDM2 inhibitor that specifically
prevents p53 degradation [23,24], with those of
bortezomib. Both nutlin-3a and bortezomib stabilize p53
presumably by preventing its degradation by proteasomes
[24,25]; however, only bortezomib also induced PS/HSR.
These effects are illustrated in Figure 6A for HCT116 cells
with wild type p53, using Hsp70 as a marker of PS/HSR.
Under the conditions used in this experiment, stabilization
of p53 by nutlin-3a was not sufficient to induce apoptosis.
This was illustrated by a lack of PARP cleavage (Fig.
6A) and no change in cell survival (Fig. 6B). In contrast,
bortezomib treatment (50 nM for 24 hours) producing
the same level of p53 stabilization caused substantial
apoptosis of p53 wild type cells (as indicated by PARP
cleavage and cell survival assays). These results indicate
that the toxicity of bortezomib is not due to stabilization
of p53, but is correlated with induction of PS. Analysis
of p53-/- HCT116 cells provided additional support for
this conclusion. Thus, even in the complete absence
of p53, bortezomib (but not nutlin-3a) induced both
Hsp70 expression indicative of PS/HSR and noticeable
PARP cleavage indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 6A). The
cytotoxicity of bortezomib, but not nutlin-3a, towards
p53-/- cells was also evident in cell survival assays (Fig.
6B).
The experiments described above (Fig. 6A, B)
demonstrate that the accumulation of p53 induced by
nutlin-3a is not sufficient on its own to trigger apoptosis in
HCT116 cells and that p53 is not required for PS-induced
cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, p53 activity might play a role
in the efficiency of apoptosis induced by PS or EPS. This
possibility is supported by the greater level of PARP
cleavage and cell death seen in bortezomib-treated p53
wild type HCT116 cells as compared to similarly treated
p53-/- HCT116 cells (Fig. 6A, B) To further evaluate
the role of p53 in the toxicity of PS, we treated p53 wild
type and p53-/- HCT116 cells with 50 nM bortezomib,
400 ng/ml puromycin or their combination for 24 hours
and evaluated induction of PS/HSR (by Hsp70 expression
assay) and apoptosis (by PARP cleavage and cell survival

in the p53 wild type cells than in the p53-/- cells. Taken
together, the data shown in Fig. 6A-D indicate that PS/
EPS-induced apoptosis is largely p53-independent: p53
activity is not required for PS/EPS-induced apoptosis;
however, it does appear to contribute to the extent of the
observed apoptosis.

assays).
In both cell lines, treatment with either 50 nM
bortezomib or 400 ng/ml puromycin resulted in PS and
treatment with their combination produced EPS (as
evidenced by the level of Hsp70 induction, Fig.6C).
PS resulting from treatment with puromycin alone was
a weak inducer of apoptosis in p53 wild type and p53/- HCT116 cells (illustrated by the low level of PARP
cleavage (Fig. 6C) and cell death (Fig. 6D)). In contrast,
while PS following from treatment with bortezomib alone
did lead to noticeable apoptosis in p53-/- HCT116 cells,
the extent of apoptosis was greater in similarly treated p53
wild type cells (Fig. 6C, D). These data are consistent with
those shown in Figure 6B for similar treatment of p53positive and –negative HCT116 cells with bortezomib
alone. The extent of apoptosis induced by treatment of
p53-/- cells with bortezomib alone was not substantially
enhanced even when the dose of drug was doubled to 100
nM (Fig. 6D).
Unlike treatment with either drug alone, combined
treatment with puromycin+bortezomib resulted in
substantial apoptosis in p53 wild type and p53-/- HCT116
cells. The extent of apoptosis in combination-treated p53/- cells was not dependent upon bortezomib dose (50
nM versus 100 nM). Even in p53 wild type cells, which
showed an apoptotic response to bortezomib alone, the
response was stronger following combination treatment.
As for treatment with bortezomib alone, the extent of
apoptosis induced by bortezomib+puromycin was greater

Anti-tumor efficacy of PSTT in a mouse model of

Although bortezomib is FDA-approved for treatment
of multiple myeloma, its clinical use is complicated by
high general toxicity [26,27]. Based upon our in vitro
data showing that combining puromycin with bortezomib
increased tumor cell killing (see above), we hypothesized
A combined administration of puromycin with

observed with inclusion of puromycin in the cell treatment.
This effect of puromycin was also dose-dependent, being
stronger with 400nM than with 200nM puromycin. These
data indicate that, as for HeLa and HT1080 cells (see
above), combination of puromycin and bortezomib results
in enhanced death of MPC11 mouse MM cells.
We next evaluated whether combination of puromycin
and bortezomib would also lead to killing of MPC11 cells
growing as solid tumors in mice. Four groups of BALB/c
mice (5 animals/group) were injected sub-cutaneously on
both sides of their bellies with 2x105 MPC11 cells. Mice
were given their first drug injection (intraperitonealy)
when at least one tumor reached 50 mm3 in size. Groups
were injected with PBS (negative control), 0.5 mg/kg
bortezomib alone, 5 mg/kg puromycin alone, or 0.5 mg/
kg bortezomib + 5 mg/kg puromycin. We chose to use the
0.5 mg/kg dose of bortezomib since the reported effective
antitumor dose of bortezomib (1 mg/kg dose [28]) caused
significant general toxicity as indicated by mouse weight
loss (Fig. 7B) and combination of 1 mg/kg bortezomib
with 5 mg/kg puromycin had the same anti-tumor effect
and same toxicity as 1 mg/kg bortezomib used alone (data
not shown). Reduction of the bortezomib dose to 0.5 mg/
kg resulted in much lower general toxicity, but also led

to a significant decrease in its anti-tumor effect (Fig. 7B
and data not shown). Importantly, however, when this
lower dose of bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg) was combined with
5 mg/kg puromycin (itself non-toxic and ineffective as a
single agent), inhibition of tumor growth was enhanced
without a substantial increase in general toxicity (Fig. 7B,
C). The tested combination of 0.5 mg/kg bortezomib + 5
mg/kg puromycin was as effective in suppressing tumor
growth as the therapeutically optimal bortezomib dose
(1.0 mg/kg) while showing less severe toxicity, as judged
by mouse body weight loss (Fig.7B, C, data not shown).

DISCUSSION
The maintenance of protein homeostasis in cells
requires the activities of chaperones, such as Hsp90,
Hsp70, and Hsp27, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system
[29], which together serve to inactivate and degrade
misfolded proteins. Elevation of the intracellular
concentration of misfolded proteins can result from
hyperthermia (heat shock), increased translation, exposure
to protein-denaturing agents, or treatment with agents that
interfere with natural mechanisms of misfolded protein
processing, such as the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin

Figure 7: Effect of EPS on MPC-11 multiple myeloma tumor growth. A. Combinatorial toxicity of bortezomib and puromycin
on MPC-11 multiple myeloma cells in vitro. MPC-11 cells growing in culture were treated with the indicated amounts (x-axis) of bortezomib
alone or in combination with 200 nM or 400 nM puromycin for 18 h. Cell survival was estimated by counting trypan blue-excluding cells.
The data shown represent the average of two independent experiments. B. In vivo drug toxicity. General toxicity of treatment regimens was
evaluated by daily measurement of mouse body weight. Groups of 3 BALB/c mice were injected with the indicated doses of drugs on the days
marked by arrows. Each data point represents the average weight in the group relative to the average weight in the group before first drug
injection. C. Effect of combined bortezomib + puromycin treatment on MPC-11 multiple myeloma tumor growth in vivo. Groups of

or the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib [15,30-32].
Regardless of the underlying cause, accumulation of
misfolded proteins leads to PS, which, if not mitigated,
can lead to protein aggregation and cell death, often via
apoptosis [33,34]. Cells are typically able to survive PS,
though, due to activation of the adaptive HSR, which
involves induction of HSF1-mediated transcription of
genes encoding additional chaperones, such as Hsp70,
and other stress-related proteins [2,31].
Effective HSR is particularly important for survival
of cancer cells, which are characterized by constitutively
high levels of PS and coincident dependence on HSF1
activity [13,35]. This presents the attractive possibility
of targeting PS and HSR as anti-cancer therapies and
indeed, inducers of PS, such as chaperone inhibitors
and proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) have
been introduced as such. It is likely, however, that the
effectiveness of these drugs is limited by the cell’s
natural HSR. Therefore, strategies aimed at increasing the
toxicity of PS towards tumor cells, such as suppression
of HSR, have been explored [10,12,13,15]. For example,
in our previous publication, we described the ability of
the anti-malaria drug quinacrine to block expression of
Hsp70 in response to PS [12]. Due to its effect on Hsp70,
combination of quinacrine with inducers of PS, such as
hyperthermia, bortezomib, or geldanamycin resulted in
increased cytotoxicity in vitro and increased suppression
of tumor growth in vivo in syngeneic transplant mouse
models [12]. These findings, together with those from a
number of other studies, demonstrate that suppression of
HSR under conditions of PS increases the toxicity of PS,
induces cancer cell death, and affects tumor growth [13].
In the current study, we tested an alternative approach
to increasing the anti-tumor toxicity of PS inducers.
Rather than blocking HSR in response to a given level
of PS, this alternative approach leaves HSR unchanged
while increasing the level of PS. We hypothesized that
combining PS inducers with different target pathways (e.g.,
combining a treatment that causes misfolding of proteins
with a treatment that prevents their degradation) would
create EPS that would exceed the capacities of the cell’s
adaptive HSR and prove intolerable for cell survival. Such
a strategy might be expected to be particularly effective
for killing of tumor cells since their HSR capacity is
partially exhausted due to pre-existing PS.
Our results demonstrate that combined treatment
with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, and an inducer
of protein misfolding (either hyperthermia or puromycin)
produced EPS and that EPS correlated with cytotoxicity.
Thus, in several cell lines in vitro, both combination
treatments greatly increased the level of PS (as evidenced
by the level of Hsp70 expression and accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins) over that induced by either single
component of the treatment used alone. Similarly, for both
hyperthermia+bortezomib and puromycin+bortezomib,
the combination treatment was much more cytotoxic than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

single treatments. The enhanced cell killing achieved with
the combination treatments does not rely on induction
of any toxic process other than the accumulation of
misfolded proteins caused by bortezomib alone, but
simply increases formation of misfolded proteins such
that the PS is “enhanced.”
Proteasome inhibition leads to stabilization and
accumulation of p53, a major pro-apoptotic regulator
of cell death/survival [36-38]. This plays an important
role in the anti-tumor efficacy of bortezomib [25,39].
Accordingly, the resistance of some tumors to proteasome
inhibitors has been attributed to their p53-negative
status or failure of the proteasome inhibitor to stabilize
p53 [40-42]. Moreover, the expression of wild type p53
in B lymphomas made them sensitive to bortezomib in
vitro and in vivo [35].In other studies, however, the
accumulation of p53 and the expression of wild type p53
in p53-/- tumor cells did not change the sensitivity of cells
to apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors [43,44]. We
found that combination treatments that produced EPS in
cultured tumor cells also reduced cell survival and induced
PARP cleavage, indicative of apoptosis. Given the known
effects of bortezomib on p53, we performed experiments
to evaluate the role of p53 in EPS-induced cell death.
Use of nutlin-3a, a compound that specifically stabilizes
p53 without inducing by PS, showed that stabilization
of p53 is not, in itself, sufficient to trigger apoptosis in
HCT116 cells. Comparison of p53 wild type and p53/- HCT116 cells treated with bortezomib, puromycin, or
their combination revealed that: (i) p53 is not absolutely
required for induction of apoptosis by PS or EPS; and (ii)
p53 does, nevertheless, contribute to the extent of PS/
EPS-induced apoptosis. The first conclusion ((i) above)
was drawn from our data showing that treatment with
bortezomib alone, and to a much greater extent, with
bortezomib+puromycin, resulted in cleavage of PARP and
reduction of cell survival in p53-deficient, as well as p53
wild type, HCT116 cells. Despite the accepted involvement
of p53 in the mechanism of action of bortezomib [25],
there are previous publications that describe killing of
p53-/- cells by proteasome inhibitors [43-45] which
support our finding that PS/EPS-induced apoptosis is, at
least in part, p53-independent. The second conclusion ((ii)
above) is supported by our finding that p53-/- cells were
less sensitive to bortezomib or bortezomib+puromycin
than p53 wild type cells were. Thus, PARP cleavage and
cell death were observed in p53-deficient cells exposed
to PS- or EPS-inducing treatments, but were observed at
higher levels in similarly treated p53 wild type cells. Our
findings that EPS is more cytotoxic than PS and that EPSinduced apoptosis is at least partially p53-independent
suggest that EPS may be a promising treatment for
p53-negative tumors in vivo. The enhanced cytotoxicity
afforded by puromycin+bortezomib treatment might be
particularly important in vivo since the time of bortezomib
activity is limited in vivo by its detoxification in the liver

MATERIALS and Methods

by oxidative deboronation [46].
Bortezomib is an FDA-approved drug for treatment
of multiple myeloma. Although multiple myeloma cells
are highly sensitive to bortezomib in vitro and die within
18 hours of exposure to just 5nM bortezomib, multiple
myeloma tumors growing in mice are rather resistant to
bortezomib treatment. In syngeneic and xenograft mouse
multiple myeloma models, non toxic doses of bortezomib
did not completely eliminate tumors, but only delayed their
growth [28,47]. Bortezomib has shown efficacy in human
multiple myeloma patients [48]; however, its application
is limited by induction of non-tumor-specific toxicity.
The typical dose of bortezomib used in the clinic is 1-1.3
mg/m2. The drug is administered 4 times with 3 days
intervals during the twice weekly treatment’s cycle [38]
or 4 times up to 1.6 mg/m2 during the weekly treatment
cycle [49]. The most frequent complication of bortezomib
treatment is development of peripheral neuropathy, which
is detected in 40-64% of treated patients with 14-30%
requiring reduction of the drug dose or discontinuation of
treatment [50,51].
Our findings in cultured cells demonstrated that
tumor cell killing could be increased by combining
bortezomib with puromycin. Therefore, we analyzed the
effect of bortezomib+puromycin combination treatment
as compared to single agent treatment on growth of
MPC11 MM syngeneic tumor transplants in BALB/c
mice. Under the treatment regimens used, high dose (1
mg/kg) bortezomib significantly delayed tumor growth,
but also caused substantial general toxicity (as evidenced
by mouse weight loss). 5 mg/kg puromycin was nontoxic and did not have any effect on tumor growth when
administered alone and did not increase the anti-tumor
toxicity of 1 mg/kg bortezomib treatment (data not
shown). However, with a lower dose of bortezomib (0.5
mg/kg) that showed low general toxicity, co-treatment
with 5 mg/kg puromycin significantly reduced tumor
growth as compared to low dose bortezomib alone. This
combination of drugs produced low general toxicity. The
ability to achieve tumor suppression with a reduced dose
of bortezomib through its combination with puromycin
is an attractive approach for anti-cancer therapy since it
allows targeting of PS without the general toxicity that
is associated with high doses of bortezomib. Overall, our
data support the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of PSTT
involving combinations of proteasome inhibitors and other
drugs that target the PS-HSR axis, such as puromycin or
quinacrine [12].

Ethics Statement
Experiments with mice were conducted strictly in
accordance with the protocol approved by the Roswell
Park Cancer Institute IACUC.

Cell culture, lentiviral vectors, and drugs
HT1080, HeLa, H1299, and HCT116 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle’s medium
(Invitrogen/Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum. MPC11 cells were grown
in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 g/ml
streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml Gentamicin
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The construct
for HSF1-specific EGFP expression (“HSE-GFP”) was
generated by inserting 6 copies of an HSF1 regulatory
element (HSE; 5’-CAGAACGTTCTAG-3’) [52] upstream
of the minimal CMV promoter in the PTR-mCMV-EGFP
lentiviral vector (Cellecta, Inc. Mountain View, CA).
Cells were infected with the resulting lentivirus at an MOI
of 10 in the presence of 4 µg/ml polybrene overnight. The
efficiency of infection was determined by detection of
EGFP expression in response to heat shock (incubation
at 430C for 1h) using fluorescent microscopy. Between 70
and 90% of the cells were infected by virus and expressed
GFP in response to heat shock. Bortezomib was from
LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The drugs puromycin,
emetine, and nutlin-3a were from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Luis, MO).

Western immunoblotting
Total protein extracts from cells were prepared in
RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris (pH
8.0), 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10 µg
of the protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis
in 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels with SDS and
then transferred to nylon PVDF membranes (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were pre-incubated
overnight in 5% milk solution, and then incubated for 1
h in 1% milk solution with primary antibodies at 1:1000
dilutions. The following primary antibodies were used:
rabbit anti-Hsp70A1 inducible form (Assay Designs/
StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada) and rabbit anti-ubiquitin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antitubulin antibody was used to control for protein loading
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Apoptosis
was analyzed by detection of caspase-specific cleavage

treatments

of PARP (antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-conjugated secondary antirabbit antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. ECL detection reagent was from Perkin
Elmer (Shelton, CT).

To evaluate general toxicity, 5 groups of 8 week old
BALB/c mice (3 mice/group) were given drug injections
(intraperitonealy) every two days (5 total injections).
Group 1 was injected with 1 mg/kg bortezomib; group 2
received 5 mg/kg puromycin; group 3 received 0.5 mg/
kg bortezomib; group 4 received 0.5 mg/kg bortezomib +
5 mg/kg puromycin; and group 5 was injected with PBS.
Individual mouse body weights were determined daily
and used to calculate the average weight for each group.

Northern blotting and hybridization
Total RNA (10 µg) from HeLa, HT1080, or HCT116
cells was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with
probes specific to the Hsp70A1 and GAPDH genes.
The Hsp70A1 probe consisted of a PCR fragment that
was generated from the Hsp70A1 cDNA (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) with primers specific for the Hsp70A1
coding sequence (A1s: 5’ CCA CCA TCC CCA CCA
AGC AGA C3’; A1a: 5’ CAT GAA CCA TCC TCT CCA
CCT 3’). All other hybridization probes were generated
by restriction endonuclease digestion from cDNA clones
(ORIGENE).

In vivo assay for tumor growth in mice

HeLa cells were treated with drugs and their
combinations according to the protocols of experiments.
The regular culture medium was changed to a methionine/
cysteine-free medium supplemented with 35S-methionine
and 35S-cysteine (50 µCi/ml) (New England Nuclear/
Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) and the cells were incubated
for an additional 60 min in the presence of drugs.
Cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared according to
the Dignam protocol [53]. Labeled proteins were analyzed
by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels followed
by autoradiography.

MPC11 cells were washed and resuspended in
sterile PBS. Cells were injected sub-cutaneous into two
sites of the shaved abdominal area of BALB/c mice
(2x105 cells in a single injection). Tumors were measured
in two dimensions using digital calipers and tumor
volume was calculated as: tumor volume (mm3) = 0.5
tumor length x (tumor width)2. On day 8 post-injection,
tumors were typically ~50 mm3 in size. Tumor-bearing
mice were divided into four groups of five animals each
and were given intraperitonealy drug injections every
2-3 days beginning on day 9. The control group (Group
1) received PBS injections. Group 2 was injected with
5 mg/kg puromycin in PBS. Group 3 received 0.5 mg/
kg bortezomib in PBS. Group 4 was injected with a
combination of the indicated doses of bortezomib and
puromycin. Tumors were measured every 2 days after the
first drug injection. Animals were euthanized if tumors
grew to > 1200 mm3.

Cell viability assay

REFERENCES

A cell viability assay was used to determine the
cytotoxicity of drugs and drug combinations. Cells were
grown to 75-80% confluency and then treated for 16 h
with various combinations and doses of bortezomib and
puromycin, or hyperthermia (430C for 1h) and bortezomib.
Cells were collected by trypsinization and a 1:50 dilution
was seeded in fresh medium without any drugs in a 12well plate. Cell viability was determined 72 h later by
methylene blue staining after fixation of the cells with
10% formaldehyde. Methylene blue was extracted by
0.1 M HCl and its absorbance was measured at 560 nm.
All assays were done in duplicate and the graphs show
the average data. Trypan blue assay was used to estimate
MPC11 MM cell viability [54].
