ABSTRACT
In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistance against one or more BCR-ABL1
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) remains a clinical challenge. Preclinical data suggest
that TKI combinations may overcome resistance. We report on a heavily pre-treated
78 year-old female patient with CML who developed multi-resistant blast crisis with
bone marrow fibrosis and a Ph- clone. Treatment with ponatinib resulted in blast cell
clearance, decrease in fibrosis, and disappearance of BCR-ABL1, but also in severe
thrombocytopenia with bleedings requiring platelet transfusions. We therefore
switched from ponatinib to bosutinib. During bosutinib, platelet counts recovered.
However, after 6 months, BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels increased to > 1%. Therefore, we
´switched back´ to ponatinib, and this was again followed by disappearance of BCRABL1 and a decrease in platelets. During the next 2 years, we applied ponatinib and
bosutinib in continuous rotation-cycles and added hydroxyurea in order to suppress
all sub-clones and to balance between efficacy and potential side effects following
the principle of personalized medicine. With this approach the patient remained in
complete molecular response and reached normal blood counts and a normal quality
of life without vascular or other side effects. In conclusion, TKI rotation is a novel
potent approach to suppress multiple resistant sub-clones and to balance between
clinical efficacy and side effects in patients with advanced CML. Clinical trials are now
warranted to show that TKI-rotation is in general safe and effective in these patients.

INTRODUCTION

can produce complete and durable cytogenetic responses
as well as major or even complete molecular responses
(MR3-MR5) in a majority of ´prescription-adherent´
CP patients [4–7]. However, not all patients (even when
´adherent´) are long-term responders. Rather, in about
20–30% of the patients, acquired resistance against
imatinib is found [7–10]. In these patients, imatinibresistant mutants of BCR-ABL1 are detected frequently.
For these cases, second-generation BCR-ABL1 TK
inhibitors (TKI) are available and are usually prescribed

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic
neoplasm characterized by expansion and accumulation of
myeloid progenitor cells exhibiting the Philadelphia (Ph)
chromosome and the related oncoprotein, BCR-ABL1
[1–3]. Usually, patients are diagnosed in the chronic phase
(CP) of the disease where most leukemic cells are addicted
to the tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of BCR-ABL1. As a
consequence the BCR-ABL1-targeting drug imatinib

blast cells displayed BCR-ABL1. We also examined
the peripheral blood (PB) and BM for the presence of
mutations in JAK2, CALR, MPL, KIT, and various AMLrelated fusion genes. However, no mutations in these
genes were detected in the patients´ blast cells in our
analyses. Blast cells were tested positive for the BCRABL1 mutations L248V and K274del, whereas the F317L
mutation that had been detected earlier in our patient, was
not found by Sanger sequencing, suggesting that this subclone and its neoplastic stem cells had been eliminated or
were controlled by TKI therapy.

to control the disease [11–15]. These TKI include
nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. All three agents
received approval for treatment of imatinib-resistant
or -intolerant CML. However, not all mutant forms of
BCR-ABL1 are recognized by these drugs. A special
problem is the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL1 that is wellknown to confer resistance against imatinib, nilotinib,
dasatinib, and bosutinib [16–18]. For these patients,
stem cell transplantation (SCT) has to be considered.
In addition, these patients often respond to ponatinib, a
novel TKI that blocks most mutant forms of BCR-ABL1,
including T315I [19–22]. Indeed, it has been shown that
ponatinib can induce major or even complete cytogenetic
responses in patients with TKI-resistant CML in whom
neoplastic cells display BCR-ABL1 T315I [20–22].
However, unfortunately, the administration of ponatinib is
associated with clinically relevant side effects, including
thrombocytopenia, an increase in pancreatic enzymes
(rarely pancreatitis), and vascular occlusive events [20–23].
Of special concern is the occurrence of vascular occlusive
diseases, as these events may lead to irreversible organ
damage or even death [20–23]. Therefore, current attempts
focus on the management and avoidance of such adverse
events in patients treated with ponatinib. One strategy may
be to decrease the dose of ponatinib from 45 mg daily to
30 or even 15 mg daily. However, it remains uncertain
whether efficacy is comparable when lower doses of the
drug are applied, especially in advanced CML. Another
strategy may be to administer co-medication that can
counteract atherosclerosis and thrombosis [23]. However,
such agents, like aspirin or statins, may also produce
side effects and may be problematic in ponatinib-treated
patients, especially when thrombocytopenia occurs.
We here describe a patient who received ponatinib
because of TKI-resistant blast crisis (BC) of CML
accompanied by bone marrow (BM) fibrosis and a Phnegative sub-clone. In this patient, ponatinib was effective
in eradicating the dominant CML clone, but also induced
severe thrombocytopenia. A switch to bosutinib resulted
in improved platelet counts, but was also followed by a
molecular relapse. Subsequently, we applied ponatinib and
bosutinib in rotation and added hydroxyurea (HU), with
the aim to suppress all sub-clones, to avoid side effects,
and to preserve efficacy at the same time, thus following
the principles of personalized medicine.

Initial response to ponatinib
After an initial start-dose of 45 mg ponatinib per day
(first week) the patient received 30 mg ponatinib daily.
Within a few weeks, blast cells decreased substantially
and disappeared in the PB. In addition, BCR-ABL1
mRNA levels decreased significantly. However, the
patient also developed severe thrombocytopenia and
bleedings requiring platelet transfusions as well as marked
neutropenia (Table 1, Figure 1). We therefore decided to
discontinue ponatinib. The patient was shortly kept on
imatinib and then switched to bosutinib (300 mg/day) on
a compassionate use program. During bosutinib, platelet
counts recovered, and the clinical situation of the patient
improved. However, after a few months, BCR-ABL1
increased again and we decided to start rotation therapy
employing ponatinib and bosutinib (Figure 1). In addition,
the patient received HU to keep the Ph-negative sub-clone
under control.

Clinical response to rotation therapy employing
ponatinib and bosutinib + HU
During treatment with ponatinib and bosutinib in
rotation-cycles combined with low dose HU (1 g/day),
BCR-ABL1 decreased to MR4.5 and finally to undetectable
levels (Figure 1). In addition, blood counts normalized and
a reinvestigation of the BM revealed a marked decrease in
BM fibrosis. After a total observation-time of 55 months,
the patient is in continuous MR4.5 with normal or near
normal blood counts and no signs of a relapse with a
Ph+ or a Ph-negative disease. Because of the potential
risk of side effects, because of concomitant HU therapy,
and because of continuous BCR-ABL1-negativity, both
drugs were maintained at relatively low doses (bosutinib:
300 mg/day; and ponatinib at 30 mg/day).

during treatment with dasatinib, and was again detectable
(and slightly increased) during treatment with bosutinib.
Therefore, the patient also received low dose prednisolone
(25 mg/day for 3 days followed by 12.5 mg/day for
another week) during therapy with bosutinib in each
cycle. In addition, the patient was maintained on aspirin as
prophylactic treatment to minimize the risk of ponatinibinduced thrombosis. Based on the well-known side effects
occurring in patients treated with nilotinib and ponatinib,
we also examined vascular and metabolic parameters
before and during treatment with ponatinib. However, no
vascular event and no substantial metabolic changes were
noted during rotation. In addition, all serum parameters,
including pancreatic enzymes, HbA1c and cholesterol
levels, remained within normal range. The European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) score was 2 (indicating an
intermediate risk to develop a cardiovascular event) before
and during treatment with ponatinib/bosutinib.

BM histology-results were obtained and compared
before and during treatment with TKI rotation therapy.
Prior to rotation therapy, a marked BM fibrosis was
seen. In addition, the BM revealed signs of dysplasia and
myeloproliferation. At the time of BC no histology was
obtained. After successful therapy with TKI rotation, the
BM showed an almost complete resolution of fibrosis and
a normal blast cell (CD34+ cell) count.

Molecular studies and HUMARA pattern
Based on the detection of a Ph-negative subclone,
we determined the clonality status before and during
treatment with BCR-ABL1 TKI. Before starting TKI
therapy, a monoclonal pattern was detected by the

HUMARA assay. During successful treatment with
dasatinib and ponatinib, a polyclonal pattern was seen
(Figure 2). However, at the time of occurrence of BM
fibrosis, the polyclonal pattern was lost and a monoclonal
pattern was observed. At that time, BCR-ABL1 levels were
still below 1%. These data suggest that the Ph-negative
(MPN/MDS-like) sub-clone that produced the massive
BM fibrosis was monoclonal in nature even though no
BCR-ABL1 was expressed.

KU812 cells and K562 cells (Figure 3A). In addition, we
were able to show that ponatinib and bosutinib inhibit the
proliferation of primary patient-derived blast cells in our in
vitro experiments (Figure 3B). In a next step, we applied
ponatinib (4 hours) and bosutinib (48 hours) sequentially
to KU812 cells to mimic in vivo drug exposure conditions,
and measured cell proliferation. As visible in Figure 3C,
clear anti-neoplastic cooperative drug effects were also
obtained in these experiments. Furthermore, we were able
to show that ponatinib and bosutinib produce cooperative
apoptosis-inducing effects in KU812 cells (Figure 3D).
Finally, the superior anti-neoplastic effects of bosutinib
and ponatinib on patient-derived leukemic cells were
confirmed in a high-throughput viability assay (Figure 4A).
In this assay the effects of bosutinib and ponatinib on
viability were stronger compared to the effects of nilotinib,
the agent under which the TKI-resistant sub-clones had

Drug combination effects in vitro
In order to confirm drug effects on CML cells, we
performed in vitro studies using two Ph+ CML cell lines
as well as ponatinib and bosutinib. In these experiments,
we were able to show that the two TKI produce strong
cooperative anti-neoplastic effects on proliferation in

Figure 1: Overview of clinical course and response to TKI rotation therapy. (A) Response to treatment with nilotinib and

ponatinib, and influence of TKI therapy on blood counts and BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels: The patient was treated with nilotinib after resistance
against dasatinib had been documented. During nilotinib, BCR-ABL1 decreased but did not disappear. After several months, BCR-ABL1
increased again and cytopenia developed. Finally, the patient developed blast crisis and treatment with ponatinib was initiated. In response
to ponatinib, BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels decreased, but the patient developed severe thrombocytopenia. (B) Response to treatment with
ponatinib/bosutinib-rotation and hydroxyurea (HU): Because of thrombocytopenia, the patient was switched to bosutinib (after a short
phase of imatinib-bridging). During bosutinib, platelet counts recovered slowly, but BCR-ABL1 increased again. Therefore, we switched
back to ponatinib, and finally decided to apply ponatinib and bosutinib in continuous rotation-cycles together with low-dose HU. Under
this therapy, blood counts normalized, the patient entered a stable continuous complete response, and has a normal quality of life without
major side effects.

blood mononuclear cells in certain time intervals (from 2005 = month 0) as indicated. As assessed by HUMARA, a monoclonal pattern was
seen in 2005 (month 0) and at the time of relapse with a Ph-negative clone when bone marrow (BM) fibrosis was detected (months 95–97).
However, after successful treatment with dasatinib and nilotinib (months 9–22), a polyclonal pattern was obtained by HUMARA testing.

in a β-counter. Results are expressed as percent of medium control and represent the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicates. In case of KU812

emerged (Figure 4A). We also applied drug combinations
in this assay. In particular, both TKI were combined
with each other and with HU, the third inhibitor that was
applied to control the Ph-negative portion of the disease.
As visible in Figure 4B, synergistic effects on cell viability
were obtained when combining bosutinib with HU. The
other drug combinations were also effective, but due to
the overwhelming effect of ponatinib, no clear synergistic
effect was demonstrable (Figure 4B).

on nilotinib with the hope that at least some of the relevant
sub-clones can be suppressed and other novel TKI will
be available. Indeed, after several months, we were able
to offer ponatinib. Based on the recommendations of the
European Leukemia Net and local guidelines, a switch
from one to another second- or third generation BCRABL1 TKI can be regarded as standard. However, the
application of continuous rotation-cycles using two of
these TKI in advanced CML must be regarded as a novel
approach. More recently, TKI rotation has also been
described as a safe and effective approach in freshly
diagnosed patients with CML [28].
Based on the overall situation in our case, we had
to treat the patient with these rotation cycles because of
the biology of the disease (only ponatinib was able to
control the BCR-ABL1+ portion of the leukemia), because
of toxicity issues, and especially because of the risk of
development of thromboembolic events during ponatinib
therapy [21, 22]. In addition, we tried to minimize the
risk of thrombosis by co-administering aspirin and by
keeping the patient on a relatively low dose of ponatinib
(30 mg/day). Moreover, the patient received HU in order
to keep the Ph-negative sub-clone under control. This
goal was indeed achieved. However, HU may also have
a protective effect against thromboembolic events and
may also exert some effects on BCR-ABL1-mutated subclones. In addition, our data suggest that HU exerts strong
synergistic anti-leukemic effects on CML cells when
combined with bosutinib or ponatinib (M.S. and P.V.,
unpublished observation).
Personalized medicine has a stringent definition and is
based on the assumption, that optimal drugs can be selected
for distinct subgroups of patients, based on the known side
effect profiles and efficacy profiles as well as knowledge
about risk factors (for the development of side effects) and
related patient-specific variables [24]. In most cancer types,
personalized medicine is currently still under development.
In CML, however, we have already the opportunity to apply
drugs and to select patients in a personalized medicinebased manner. Indeed, the patient described here is a good
example how a personalized medicine concept can be
applied. The application of such a personalized regimen
allowed us to manage a severe relapsing disease as well as
to avoid potential (and to overcome obvious) side effects so
that treatment could be continued with optimal response and
satisfactory quality of life.
Severe thrombocytopenia is a well-known side effect
of ponatinib [20, 21]. In our patient, thrombocytopenia
was managed effectively by the rotation-approach. A
second potentially life-threatening side effect of ponatinib
is thromboembolism, which may occur preferentially in
elderly, comorbid, patients [21]. We tried to avoid this
side-effect by TKI-rotation therapy and co-administered
aspirin. Third, the patient was suffering from severe
constipation which is most probably attributable to the KITtargeting effects of TKI on the pacemaker cells of the GI

DISCUSSION
Despite the availability of novel BCR-ABL1 TKI
and SCT, advanced CML remains a challenge in clinical
hematology. The prognosis of patients who develop blast
crisis during TKI therapy is particularly poor. We here
report on an elderly non-transplantable CML patient who
developed blast crisis after having received several different
TKI for over 6 years. In this particular patient, we were able
to induce a complete molecular response with ponatinib.
However, because of overt side effects with severe lifethreatening thrombocytopenia and-later-the risk of fatal
thrombosis, we had to adjust the overall treatment plan
following the principles of personalized medicine, where
drugs are selected or even combined to optimize efficacy
and minimize (the risk of) side effects at the same time [24].
In our case, we applied ponatinib and bosutinib in rotationcycles, thereby avoiding ponatinib-induced side effects and
maintained MR4.5 at the same time.
Although BCR-ABL1 is a major driver and player
in the pathogenesis of CML, multiple additional lesions
and pathways are considered to contribute to disease
progression and drug resistance in advanced disease
[2, 25, 26]. Such additional pathways and molecules
supposedly lead to a complex clonal architecture, with
multiple sub-clones and diverse features that may be
quite different from that of the original dominant clone.
Sometimes, even, progression to an acute Ph-negative
leukemia is seen [27]. In our patient, disease progression
was associated with clonal evolution of Ph-positive subclones, as evidenced by the demonstration of additional
BCR-ABL1 mutations, but also with occurrence of a
Ph-negative sub-clone that presented as an overt MDS/
MPN-like disease with massive BM fibrosis. The clonal
HUMARA pattern did not change during the time of
evolution of this Ph-negative sub-clone, suggesting
that both the Ph-positive and Ph-negative portion of the
disease were probably indeed monoclonal. However,
unfortunately, we were not able to perform deep
sequencing studies to confirm our assumption.
As mentioned above, TKI resistance remains a
challenge in the treatment of CML, especially when the
patient is resistant to all available TKI. In our patient, the
CML clone was resistant against imatinib, dasatinib, and
nilotinib, and at this time, neither ponatinib nor bosutinib
was available. Therefore, we had to maintain the patient

tract (cells of Cajal are KIT-dependent). The constipation
resolved completely after switching from ponatinib to
bosutinib, a drug that spares KIT. Finally, the recurrent
pleural effusions that had developed under dasatinib and
were recurrent during initial treatment with bosutinib,
almost resolved when the patient switched to rotationTKI therapy and co-administered prednisolone. All in all,
the obvious advantages of the rotation have led to a longlasting symptom-free period of CMR and a normal quality
of life in our patient, which may be regarded as a triumph
of personalized medicine. Interestingly, TKI rotation has
recently also been applied in patients with freshly diagnosed
CML using nilotinib and imatinib, with encouraging results
and a reduced rate of vascular and metabolic events [28].
However, rotation therapy with ponatinib and bosutinib,
although following the same principle, must be regarded
as experimental approach. In fact, based on our case
observation, clinical studies are now warranted in order to
define whether TKI rotation is indeed a safe and effective
strategy in patients with advanced TKI-refractory CML.
In vitro drug testing is a powerful approach to
confirm or predict clinical responses, especially when
patient-derived cells or CML cell lines are tested
[32, 29, 30]. In the current study, we were able to show
that the patient-derived leukemic blasts were responsive
against HU, ponatinib, and bosutinib. In addition, all three
drugs were found to counteract growth in two human
CML cell lines, KU812 and K562. Moreover, we were
able to show that ponatinib and bosutinib produce clear
synergistic effects on growth and apoptosis of KU812
cells and some cooperative anti-leukemic effects in K562
cells. In addition, we were able to show that sequential
application of ponatinib and bosutinib in vitro, which was
performed to mimic exposure conditions in vivo, results
in major cooperative drug effects in KU812 cells. Finally,
we were able to show in a high-capacity screen that the
patient-derived leukemic blasts are responsive to bosutinib
and ponatinib, and that these TKI synergize with HU in
blocking the viability of her cells. These data strongly
suggest that drug responses of primary cells (and drug
combination effects) may be predicted by drug testing
and that synergistic anti-CML effects can be achieved
by combining second generation TKI with each other or
with HU. In fact, the patient also received HU together
(in combination) with TKI. Therefore, some of the
(unexpectedly strong) effect of therapy may be due to this
TKI+HU combination. Based on the sub-clone concept
of stem cell evolution in CML [31, 32] the clinical effect
is best explained by TKI-induced eradication of stem
cell-derived sub-clones [33] which was confirmed by
demonstrating the complete disappearance of BCR-ABL1bearing cells in our patient.
In conclusion, we present a patient with TKIresistant multi-mutated blast crisis and a Ph-negative
sub-clone producing severe BM fibrosis, in whom we
induced a continuous CMR with TKI-rotation therapy

complemented by HU, without major side effects. Such
treatment strategies are in line with personalized medicine
[24] and recent developments in the field [28] and may
lead to the design of new improved treatment concepts
in TKI-resistant CML. Eventually, such novel treatment
concepts may also assist in the early eradication of all
relevant CML sub-clones at diagnosis, so that it may be

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case report
A 78-year-old female patient with multi-resistant
Ph+ CML was referred because of blast crisis in July 2013.
She had first been diagnosed with CML in 2001 in another
hospital. Initially, she had received interferon-alpha and
cytarabine, and later, from May 2002, imatinib at 400
mg daily. However, after an initial response, resistance
against imatinib developed, and she was referred to
our center in 2005. At that time accelerated CML was
diagnosed and she received a combination of rapamycin
and hydroxyurea (HU). However, despite cytoreduction,
no major molecular response was obtained. Subsequently,
she received dasatinib (2 × 70 mg/day) and entered a
complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). However, in
2007, she developed pleural effusion, and after the dose of
dasatinib was reduced to 100 mg/day, a dasatinib-resistant
sub-clone bearing the BCR-ABL1 mutation F317L
emerged. Treatment with nilotinib (2 × 400 mg/day) was
introduced. In response to nilotinib, the patient entered a
23068

second CCyR, and BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels decreased
to < 0.1% (of ABL1) in September 2008. However, in
December 2009, BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels increased to
0.5%. Subsequently, the BCR-ABL1 mutation L248V was
detected. During the next few months, BCR-ABL1 slowly
increased further. However, because of stable blood counts
and lack of alternative therapy options, she was maintained
on nilotinib. In January 2011, a BM investigation revealed
marked fibrosis without an increase in blast cells. Later in
2011, the patient developed transfusion-dependent anemia
and thrombocytopenia (Table 1). In addition, BCR-ABL1
increased to 30%, and both L248V and a new BCR-ABL1
mutation, K274del, were detected. In June 2012, the
patient developed an overt blast crisis. Treatment with
ponatinib on a compassionate use program was initiated.

according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern was determined
by PCR analysis of the polymorphic CAG-repeat region
in the HUMARA gene which is located next to an HpaII
restriction site. Genomic DNA (~250 ng) was digested
with HpaII for 19 hours at 37°C. Then, aliquots of
undigested and HpaII-digested DNA were subjected to
PCR using published primer sequences [41]. Amplicons
were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 3130xl
genetic analyser (Foster City, CA, USA) using the Gene
Scan 3.7 (ABI) software. For quantification, the areas
under the peaks of the two alleles from the undigested and
digested DNA were determined and the ratio of the peak
area of both alleles (X1, X2) was calculated (in summary
100%). The degree of X-chromosome inactivation is
presented as percent of the smaller peak (X2) in relation
to the larger peak (X1). Undigested female DNA usually
shows 2 peaks of similar height (in 90% of females).

Bone marrow studies
BM studies were performed in certain time
intervals, namely every 6–12 months before the start
of ponatinib, and 18 months after the start of ponatinib.
Histologic examinations included routine histology
parameters, a Gomori silver stain (to detect and quantify
fibrosis) and immunohistochemistry using antibodies
against CD34, CD117 (KIT), and CD61. Histologic and
immunohistochemical examinations were performed
by the indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique
following generally accepted standards [34, 35]. WrightGiemsa stained BM smears were examined for the
percentage of blast cells, promyelocytes, basophils, and
other BM cells as well as cellular dysplasia (atypia).
In addition, molecular and cytogenetic studies were
performed on aspirated BM cells.

Isolation of primary cells and in vitro drug
testing
Based on the intriguing effects of therapy with
ponatinib and bosutinib on leukemic cells in this patient,
we performed in vitro assays in order to explore whether
these drugs exert synergistic growth-inhibitory effects
on CML cells. In these experiments, primary patientderived cells and the BCR-ABL1+ cell lines KU812 and
K562 were employed. KU812 cells were kindly provided
by Dr.K.Kishi (Niigata University, Niigata, Japan)
and K562 cells kindly provided by Dr.M.W.Deininger
(University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS
and exposed to various concentrations of ponatinib and
bosutinib (both from ChemieTek, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) alone or in combination (in quadruplicates). In
case of drug combinations, a fixed ratio of compounds
was applied essentially as described [42, 43]. After 24 or
48 hours, 3H-thymidine uptake and apoptosis (Annexin
V-staining) were measured as reported previously [42, 43].
In a separate set of experiment, mononuclear BM cells
obtained from the patient at the time of BC were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% FCS in the absence or
presence of various concentrations of ponatinib, bosutinib,
or hydroxyurea (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After
48 hours, uptake of 3H-thymidine was measured. In a
separate set of experiments, KU812 cells were incubated
in medium containing ponatinib (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 nM)
for 4 hours (37°C), washed, and then cultured in various
concentrations of bosutinib (10–22 nM) for another 48
hours before 3H-thymidine was measured.

Molecular studies and karyotyping
BCR-ABL1 transcripts were quantified by real-time
PCR according to a published protocol using the Ipsogen
BCR-ABL-Mbcr Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the
LightCycler 2.0-System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
[36]. BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels were expressed as percent
of ABL1 mRNA after adjusting PCR-data according to the
international scale (IS) [37, 38]. BCR-ABL1 mutations
were tested by Sanger sequencing of the ABL1 TK domain
(codon 207–414) after specific amplification of BCRABL1 as reported [39]. Conventional cytogenetics and
fluorescence in situ-hybridization (FISH) were performed
according to published protocols [40].

Human androgen receptor (HUMARA)
polymorphism analysis
HUMARA analysis was performed using peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (MNC) obtained at various time
points before and during TKI therapy, following published
techniques [41]. In brief, DNA was isolated from MNC
using the MagNA Pure LC DNA isolation system (Roche)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Measurement of apoptosis in KU812 cells
KU812 cells were incubated in control medium,
ponatinib (0.2 nM), bosutinib (10 nM), or a combination
of both drugs at 37°C for 48 hours. Then, apoptotic

cells were quantified by Annexin-V/PI staining and flow
cytometry. In brief, cells were washed, resuspended in
Annexin-V binding buffer for 15 minutes. Cells were
then washed again, and propidium iodide (1 mg/mL)
was added. After washing, cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose,
CA, USA) to determine the percentage of Annexin-V/PI+
(apoptotic) cells.
