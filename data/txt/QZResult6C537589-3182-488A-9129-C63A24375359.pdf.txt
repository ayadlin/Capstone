Abstract
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gamma-1 herpesvirus that establishes a
lifelong latency in over 90% of the world’s population. During latency, virus exists
predominantly as a chromatin-associated, multicopy episome in the nuclei of a
variety of tumor cells derived from B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and
epithelial cells. Licorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis or G. glabra that has
traditionally cultivated in eastern part of Asia. Licorice was reported to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-atopic, hepatoprotective, anti-neurodegenerative, antitumor, anti-diabetic effects and so forth. Quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are produced
from licorice and highly similar in molecular structure. They have diverse bioactive
effects such as antiviral activity, anti-asthmatic activity, anti-cancer activity, antiinflammation activity, monoamine-oxidase inhibitor, and etc. To determine anti-EBV
and anti-EBVaGC (Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric carcinoma) effects of licorice,
we investigated antitumor and antiviral effects of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin
against EBVaGC. Although both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are cytotoxic to SNU719
cells, quercetin induced more apoptosis in SNU719 cells than isoliquiritigenin, more
completely eliminated DNMT1 and DNMT3A expressions than isoliquiritigenin, and
more strongly affects the cell cycle progression of SNU719 than isoliquiritigenin. Both
quercetin and isoliquiritigenin induce signal transductions to stimulate apoptosis,
and induce EBV gene transcription. Quercetin enhances frequency of F promoter use,
whereas isoliquiritigenin enhances frequency of Q promoter use. Quercetin reduces
EBV latency, whereas isoliquiritigenin increases the latency. Quercetin increases more
the EBV progeny production, and inhibits more EBV infection than isoliquiritigenin.
These results indicate that quercetin could be a promising candidate for antiviral and
antitumor agents against EBV and human gastric carcinoma.

isoflavone, chalcone, anthocyanin and catechin [16].
Quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are produced from
licorice and highly similar in molecular structure
[17]. Quercetin is a licorice flavonoid and its IUPAC
name is 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy4H-chromen-4-one . Actually, quercetin belongs to a
type of flavonols, which is a class of flavonoids that
have the 3-hydroxyflavone backbone (3-hydroxy-2phenylchromen-4-one) and present in a wide variety
of herbs including licorice [10]. Isoliquiritigenin is
classified into chalcone, which is an aromatic ketobe that
forms a central core for chalcones or chalconoids [17].
It’s IUPAC name is (E)-1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(4hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one. Isoliquiritigenin exists
in some foodstuffs and herbal medicines such as licorice
[10].
Several studies demonstrated that quercetin had
diverse bioactive effects such as antiviral activity, antiasthmatic activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-inflammation
activity, monoamine-oxidase inhibitor, and etc. Quercetin
has shown to impair an oncoviral replication. Quercetin
inhibited HBsAg and HBeAg secretion in the HBV
(Hepatitis virus B)-producing 2.2.15 cells [18]. In addition,
quercetin appeared to be the most effective inhibitor for
HCV replication among all flavonoids, demonstrating a
strong anti-HCV activity in HCV replicon-containing cells
when combined with interferon (IFN)α [19]. Quercetin
and its analog quercetin showed stronger inhibition on
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, all with IC50 values of 60 μM
than HIV-1 protease and α-Glucosidase [20]. Quercetin
was shown to inhibit other three reverse transcriptases
from avian myeloblastosis, Rous-associated virus-2
and Maloney murine leukemia virus when poly(rA)
oligo(dT)12-18 or rabbit globin mRNA were used as
template [21]. Several studies investigated potential use
for quercetin as anti-cancer agent [22]. A couple of cell
culture studies showed that quercetin has an anti-cancer
activity due to its antioxidant or anti-inflammatory
properties [23]. Quercetin also inhibits the growth of
cancer cells and helps induction of apoptosis [24]. Some
studies using animal models have shown that quercetin
could protect against colon cancer [25]. However, there is
no reliable clinical evidence that quercetin has a protective
effect on human cancer.
Isoliquiritigenin has reported to have various
bioactive effects including antiviral activities, antioxidant
activities, an antiplatelet aggregation effect, an antialdose
reductase activity, estrogenic properties, and selective
inhibition of H2 receptor-mediated signaling. Yuko et al
found that in vitro Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication
was significantly suppressed by isoliquiritigenin and
glycycoumarin, which were isolated from Glycyrrhize
radix [26]. The suppression of HCV replication by two
compounds appeared to be dose-dependent whose ED50s
were 6.2 μg/ml and 15.5 μg/ml, respectively. Adianti et al
discovered that isoliquiritigenin obtained from Glycyrrhiza

Hodgkin’s disease, post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disease, NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
and gastric carcinoma [4, 5]. Average 10% of gastric
carcinoma (GC) has been diagnosed as EBV associated
GC (EBVaGC) [6]. In each EBV-positive cases of GC,
EBV infects almost all gastric carcinoma cells [7]. It
reported that the worldwide occurrence of EBVaGC is
estimated at more than 50,000 cases per year [8]. Thus,
EBVaGC is the most common cancer among EBV
associated malignancies.
Licorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis or G.
glabra that have traditionally been cultivated in eastern
part of Asia. These plants are scientifically classified in
Glycyrrhiza of Fabales. The word “licorice” is derived
from the Greek meaning “sweet root” and demonstrated
anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-atopic, hepatoprotective,
anti-neurodegenerative, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic effects
and so forth [9]. Glycyrrhiza is known to produce a variety
of bioactive compounds such as triterpene (glycyrrhizin,
18β(α)-glycyrrhetinic acid), isoflavan (glabridin,
licoricidin), flavanone (liquiritin, liquiritigenin), chalconne
(isoliquiritigenin, licochalcone A(B)), flavonol (quercetin),
3-arylcoumarin (glycyrol, glycyrin), and miscellaneous
compounds [10].
Among these compounds, glycyrrhizic acid
(GA) is a triterpene composed of one molecule
of 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid and two molecules of
D-glucuronic acid [11]. These component molecules
of GA are released from upon hydrolysis. GA and its
component compounds have exhibited antiviral effects
against several viruses that include retrovirus, herpesvirus,
influenza virus, hepatitis virus, enterovirus, and etc [12].
In particular, some herpesviral infection appeared to
be inhibited by in vitro treatment of GA. Jung-Chung
et al reported that early steps of EBV infection such as
EBV attachment or penetration were interfered by GA
treatment [13]. We previously showed that Kaposi’s
sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent infection
was disrupted by GA treatment [14]. Physical binding
of GA to cohesion resulted in loss of significant roles of
CTCF-Cohesin complex on transcription of KSHV latent
transcript unit. Hung et al found that GA perfusion in
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection greatly decreased
adhesion and stress between rat cerebral capillary vessel
endothelial cells (CCECs) and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMN), suggesting that GA may attenuate
inflammatory responses in HSV infection [15]. Therefore,
GA is likely to be a major bioactive compound responsible
for protective effects of licorice against viral infections.
However, besides of GA, a variety of natural compounds
has been isolated from licorice extracts. In order to
precisely determine therapeutic effects of licorice, it is
necessary to find out if these compounds also produce
strong an antiviral effect like GA.
Based on molecular structures, flavonoids are
classified into flavon, flavonol, flavanone, flavanol,

inflate and Glycyrrhiza glabra showed anti-HCV activity,
with IC50 of 3.7 μg/ml [11]. Therefore, we expect that both
quercetin and isoliquiritigenin can be good therapeutic
candidates for anti-EBV as well as EBV associated gastric
cancer reagents.
To determine anti-EBV and anti-EBVaGC effects
of licorice, we investigated first, antitumor effects of
quercetin and isoliquiritigenin against EBVaGC, second,
antiviral effects of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin against
EBV, and third, the molecular mechanisms responsible for
the antiviral and antitumor activities.

necrosis/late apoptosis, and membrane integrity of
SNU719 cells treated either quercetin or isoliquiritigenin
for 48 h. Quercetin treatment induced significantly more
early apoptosis and necrosis/late apoptosis in SNU719
cells than isoliquiritigenin treatment. Compared to
DMSO treatment, quercetin treatment showed to induce
early apoptosis approximately up to 175% and necrosis/
late apoptosis up to 215%, whereas isoliquiritigenin
treatment did not cause significant differences (Figure
2A, Supplemental Figure 1). However, membrane
integrity of SNU719 cells was not affected by quercetin
or isoliquiritigenin treatments, compared to DMSO
treatment (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure 1). These
results indicated that quercetin and isoliquiritigenin did
induce apoptosis without disrupting membrane integrity
of SNU719 cells.
Western blot assay was conducted to determine
if quercetin and isoliquiritigenin treatments cause any
effect on PARP and cleavage PARP protein production in
SNU719 cells. As PARP is known to help cells to maintain
their viability [39], cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular
disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing
apoptosis [39]. Compared of mock (DMSO), quercetin
treatment showed significantly more cleaved PARP
protein than isoliquiritigenin treatment (Figure 2B). In
addition, as phosphatidyl JNK in JNK signal pathway
is known to induces apoptosis [40], Western blot assay
using anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK antibody was conducted
to define if quercetin treatment enhances to produce
phospho-SAPK/JNK. As expected, quercertin treatment
increased phospho-SAPK/JNK production more than
isoliquiritigenin treatment (Figure 2C). SP600125 is an
anthrapyrazolone inhibitor of JNK kinase that competes
with ATP to inhibit the phosphorylation of c-Jun [30]. In
order to confirm that quercetin induces apoptosis through
JNK pathway, SP600125 was co-treated in all treatments
of licorice-derived compounds. The co-treatment of
SP600125 (10 μM) suppressed the phosphorylation of
c-Jun in all treatments except TPA/NaB treatment (Figure
2D). At the same time, SP600125 treatment significantly
dampened quercetin mediated apoptosis , yet it produced
mild effects on isoliquiritigenin mediated apoptosis
(Figure 2E). Next we questioned if EBV infection plays an
important role in quercetin mediated apoptosis. To answer
this question, Western blot assay using PARP and Phospho
JNK antibodies applied to three types of AGS cells such
as EBV-negative AGS cells, wild type (wt) EBV infected
AGS cells, and recombinant EBV infected AGS cells
[41]. The JNK expression in EBV positive AGS cells was
significantly higher than that in EBV negative AGS cells,
while the phospho-JNK in EBV positive AGS cells was
remarkably lower than that in EBV negative AGS cells
(Figure 2F, 2G, 2H). However, the phosphorylation of
JNK in EBV positive AGS cells was remarkably induced
by treatments of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin, compared
to that in EBV negative AGS cells (Figure 2F, 2G, 2H).

RESULTS
Both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are cytotoxic
to SNU719 cells
As molecular structures of quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin are similar each other, antitumor activities
of quercetin was compared with those of isoliquiritigenin.
In order to determine 50% cytotoxicity dose of quercetin
or isoliquiritigenin against EBV associated gastric
carcinoma cell line SNU719 cells, cellular cytotoxicity
assay was conducted with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) (Dojindo). CCK-8 allows for sensitive colorimetric
assay determination of the number of viable cells in cell
proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. 50% cytotoxicity
dose (CD50) of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin against
SNU719 were 62 μM and 45 μM, respectively (Figure
1A and 1B). In addition, in order to define time kinetics
of cytotoxicities of quercetin and isoliquritigenin, CD50s
produced by each compound treatment were determined
on time course. During 48 h time course, CD50s were
decreased from undetectable levels to values presented
above (Figure 1C and 1D). Cell viability was also
determined on time course in SNU719 cells treated with
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin using cell viability assay
using trypan blue staining. Although quercetin treatment
showed slightly lower cell viability compared to the
treatments of DMSO or isoliquritigenin, all treatments
exhibited more than 85% of cell viability during the 48 h
time course (Figure 1E and 1F).

Quercetin induced more apoptosis than
isoliquiritigenin, while both did not disrupt
membrane integrity
Two apoptosis assays as FITC Annexin V Apoptosis
Detection assay and Western blot assay using anti-PARP
antibody were conducted to analyze effects of quercetin
or isoliquiritigenin on apoptosis and membrane integrity.
First, FITC Annexin V Apoptosis detection assay was
conducted to analyze cytotoxic effects on early apoptosis,

In detail, quercetin treatment showed slightly more
phospho JNK form than isoliquiritigenin treatment in EBV
positive AGS cells. Furthermore, the expression of PARP
was completely inhibited by quercetin treatment in EBV
positive AGS cells, yet that expression was not affected
by quercetin treatment in EBV negative AGS cells.
These results indicated that EBV infection is required
for quercetin mediated apoptosis. Taken together, these
studies led to suggest that quercetin is highly cytotoxic via
apoptosis, which is mediated by JNK pathway and EBV
infection.

PCR demonstrated that compared to DMSO treatment,
quercetin treatment slightly decreased methylation on
the downstream region of EBV F/Q promoter, while
isoliquritigenin did not show any difference (Figure 4C).
As controls in both MSP assay, compared to the mock
treatment, 10 µM 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment
highly suppressed methylation and induced demethylation.
When each band intensity was quantitated relative to sum
of all band intensity using ImageQuant 5.2 [35], quercetin
treatment showed decrease in both methylation and
unmethylation around the downstream of Fp/Qp, while
isoliquiritigenin treatment showed no significant effect
on methylation and even slightly increased unmethylation
around the downstream of Fp/Qp (Figure 4D).
Hino et al reported that STAT3 pathway is known
to upregulate DNMT1 [43]. Based on this report, it was
questioned that qucercetin treatment might downregulate
STAT3 or suppress phosphorylation of STAT3. To clarify
this aim, western blot analysis using anti-STAT3 and antiphospho-STAT3 antibodies was conducted. Compared to
DMSO treatment, quercetin treatment did not suppress
the phosphorylation of STAT3, while isoliquiritigenin
treatment slightly enhanced the STAT3 phosphorylation.
Unlike the previous study [43], this results indicated that
quercetin downregulates DNMTs in a STAT3-independnt
manner (Figure 4E). Moreover, co-treatment of SP600125
(JNK inhibitor, 10 μM) and quercetin clearly suppressed
the phosphorylation of STAT3, while co-treatment of
SP600125 and isoliquiritigenin remarkably enhanced the
phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figure 4F). In the meantime,
the co-treatment of SP600125 and quercetin totally
abolished both DNMT1 and DNMT3 expressions, yet the
co-treatment of SP600125 and isoliquiritigenin abolished
only DNMT3a (Figure 4G). These results indicated that
DNMT1 is regulated by quercetin in STAT3 independent
manner and DNMT3 is controlled by quercetin in STAT3
dependent manner.
Taken together, this study suggested that reduction
of demethylation by quercetin may play an important
role in expression of hypermethylated genes in SNU719
genome and EBV genome.

Isoliquiritigenin does not affect cell cycle, but
quercetin strongly affects cell cycle
To determine whether quercetin affected cell cycle
progression in SNU719 cells, PI staining and FACs
analysis were performed on SNU719 cells treated with
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin for 48 h. Compared to mock
treatment (DMSO), quercetin treatment significantly
delayed S phase twice longer than mock treatment (Figure
3A), but isoliquiritigenin treatment slightly delayed G1
phase by 10% compared to mock treatment (Figure 3B).
These results suggested that quercetin treatment did cause
severe defects in normal cell-cycle progress by arresting
S/G2 phase transition..

Quercetin eliminated DNMT1 and DNMT3A
expressions
In order to determine if quercetin or isoliquiritigenin
affected methylation on CpG domains in cellular genes
or EBV latent/lytic promoters, Western blot assay and
methylation-specific PCR assays were performed. Western
blot analysis using anti-DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase
1) and DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A) antibodies
revealed that quercetin treatment almost completely
eliminated both DNMT1 and DNMT3A expression, while
isoliquiritigenin treatment did not affect both DNMT1
and DNMT3A expressions (Figure 4A). Next, it was
questioned if loss of DNMTs induced by quercetin might
demethylate tumor suppressor genes and EBV locuses.
Since SNU719 cells were known to densely methylated
in TP73, BLU, FSD1, BCL7A, MARK1, SCRN1, and
NKX3.1 genes [42], methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
following bisulfate conversion of DNA for methylation
was conducted to define if quercetin and isoliquiritigenin
affect methylation on tumor suppressor gene BCL7A
and EBV promoter locuses. The MSP assay following
realtime quantitative PCR revealed that compared to
DMSO treatment, quercetin treatment slightly decreased
methylation on CpG domain in BCL7A gene although
it was statistically insignificant, while isoliquritigenin
slightly increased the methylation (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, the MSP assay following semi-quantitative

Both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin induce signal
transductions to stimulate apoptosis
Since quercetin and isoliquiritigenin resulted in
different expression patterns of DNMT1 and DNMT3A,
it was considered that quercetin and isoliquiritigenin
might go through different signaling pathways in SNU719
cells. Cignal finder reporter assay proved that quercetin
treatment significantly stimulated 5 signaling pathways
and suppressed 4 signaling pathways among 45 signaling
pathways tested (Figure 5A). The 4 activated signaling
pathways were estrogen, heat shock response, MAPK/
ERK, and MAPK/JNK pathway. The 5 suppressed

signaling pathways were glucocorticoid, heavy metal
stress, interferon gamma, liver X receptor, and TGF-beta
pathway. On the other hand, isoliquiritigenin treatment
remarkably induced 5 signaling pathways and repressed
one signaling pathway (Figure 5B). The 5 activated
signaling pathways are amino acid deprivation response,
MAPK/ERK, MAPK/JNK, PPAR, and retinoid X receptor
pathway. The suppressed signaling pathway was interferon
regulatory factor 1 pathway. Signaling pathways regulated
by either quercetin or isoliquiritigenin is simultaneously

involved in both cellular apoptosis and survival programs.
For example, the activation of MAPK/JNK pathway
by both quercetin and sioliquiritigenin treatments
supported the induction of apoptosis by quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin because JNK pathway is likely to proceed
downstream signaling for apoptosis [40].
In addition, downregulation of glucocorticoid
pathway by quercetin could support the induction of
apoptosis by quercetin because glucocorticoid is known
to trans-repress AP-1 that transduces signals for apoptosis

significantly increased transcription of lytic genes such
as BNRF1, BCRF1, BLLF1, BZLF1 and BRLF1 and
latent genes such as LMP1, EBNA3A, and EBNA3C.
Isoliquiritigenin treatment enhanced transcription of
lytic genes such as BNRF1, BCRF1, BLLF1, BZLF1,
and BRLF1 and latent genes such as LMP1, LMP2,
EBER1, EBNA3C and EBNA1. However, compared
to isoliquiritigenin treatment, quercetin treatment
upregulated more EBV lytic genes such as BLLF1, BZLF1,
and BRLF1. On the other hand, compared to quercetin
treatment, isoliquiritigenin treatment upregulated EBV
latent genes such as LMP2, EBER1, EBNA3A, EBNA3C,
and EBNA1. Given that BZLF1, key factor for EBV lytic
reactivation, was upregulated by quercetin and EBNA1,

Both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin induce EBV
gene transcription
To find if quercetin or isoluqiritgenin has an
antiviral effect on EBV transcription, we investigated
transcription patterns in SNU719 cells treated with either
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin using RT-qPCR assay (Figure
6). Compared to mock treatment, quercetin treatment

which a transcriptional factor specific to a signaling pathway was cloned. Signaling pathways affected by either quercetin or isoliquiritigenin
were chosen when their fold changes were immensely higher or lower than negative and positive reporter signals (shaded by red box).

wild type (wt) EBV infected AGS cells, and recombinant
EBV infected AGS cells [41]. BZLF1 expression was not
detected in EBV negative AGS cells, yet the expression
was significantly induced by quercetin or isoliquiritigenin
in EBV positive AGS cells (Figure 7C, 7D, 7E). In
detail, quercetin treatment induced slightly more BZLF1
than isoliquiritigenin. In contrast, the expression of
EBNA1 in EBV positive AGS cells was not induced
by isoliquiritigenin treatment and it was even severely
suppressed by quercetin treatment, compared to that
in EBV negative AGS cells (Figure 7C, 7D, 7E). These
results indicated that the BZLF1 induction by quercetin
is a common event in EBV associated gastric carcinoma
cells. Taken together, these studies led to suggest that
quercetin is likely to induce EBV lytic reactivation and
isoliquiritigenin tends to maintain EBV latent replication
in EBV associated gastric carcinoma cells.

key factor for EBV latency establishment, was upregulated
by isoliquritigenin [46], these results indicated that
quercetin stimulates EBV lytic replication cycle while
isoliquiritigenin stimulates EBV latent replication cycle.

Quercetin enhances EBV lytic proteins, while
isoliquiritigenin enhances EBV latent proteins
Similar to the transcription assay, we were interested
in whether the expression of EBV protein was also
affected by quercetin or isoliquiritigenin treatments.
To analyze EBV protein expression, Western blot assay
using anti-EBV EBNA1, BZLF1, and LMP2A antibodies
was conducted with SNU719 treated either quercetin or
isoliquiritigenin for 48 h. Like transcription patterns of
EBV genes affected by both compounds, the Western assay
showed that quercetin did enhance BZLF1 and LMP2A
expressions, however, isoliquiritigenin remarkably
induced LMP2A expressions (Figure 7A). In addition, in
order to define time kinetics of effects of quercetin and
isoliquritigenin on EBV protein production, the effects
by the two compounds were determined on time course
of SNU719 treated with quercetin or isoliquritigenin.
During 48 h time course, quercetin treatment enhanced
BZLF1 expression, yet suppressed EBNA1 expression. In
contrast, isoliquiritigenin treatment exhibited little effect
on BZLF1 expression and EBNA1 expression during the
time course except 24 h post treatment (Figure 7B).
Next we questioned if the EBV lytic gene is
induced by quercetin in different EBV associated gastric
carcinoma cells. To answer this aim, western blot assay
using EBNA1 and BZLF1 antibodies applied to three
types of AGS cells such as EBV-negative AGS cells,

Quercetin enhances frequency of F promoter use,
whereas isoliquiritigenin enhances frequency of Q
promoter use
Because both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin affected
expression of most EBV genes, it was questioned whether
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin affected the frequency of use
of EBV latency promoters such as Cp, Qp, and Fp [2]. As
controls, KEM1 cells (EBV latency type 1-positive cells)
showed a high frequency of use of Q and F promoters
(Figure 9A) [47]. KEM3 cells specific to EBV type III
demonstrated high frequency of use of C/W promoters
(Figure 8A) [47]. Quercetin treatment significantly
decreased frequency of use of Q promoter and increased
frequency of use of F promoter, supporting functional

BRLF1, and it increased also transcriptions of latent gene such as LMP1, EBNA3A and EBNA3C. Isoliquiritigenin significantly increased
transcriptions of lytic genes such as BNRF1, BCRF1, BLLF1, BZLF1 and BRLF1, and it increased also transcriptions of latent gene such as
LMP1, LMP2, EBER1, EBNA3A , EBNA3C and EBNA1. Statistical significance is when the P-value is < 0.05 (95% confidence). ISL and

By contrast, isoliquiritigenin treatment clearly decreased

Quercetin reduces EBV latency,
isoliquiritigenin increases the latency

It was also questioned whether quercetin or
isoliquiritigenin have effects on preventing EBV infection
to virus-susceptible cells. LCL-EBV-GFP [37] and AGS
[38] cell to cell coinfection assay was designed to test if
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin treatments could favor EBV
infection from LCL to AGS cells (Figure 11A). EBV
could be transferred from LCL-EBV to AGS using coculture infection system. Compared to mock (DMSO),
quercetin treatment significantly suppressed the transfer
of EBV from LCL-EBV-GFP cells to AGS cells, but
isoliquiritigenin treatment did not have any effect on EBV
infection (Figure 11B). We postulated that EBV progenies
produced by quercetin treatment failed to infect quercetintreated AGS cells, and yet EBV progenies produced by
isoliquiritigenin succeeded to infect isoliquiritigenintreated AGS cells. These results suggested that quercetin
treatment is likely to cause severe defects on EBV
infection steps such as EBV receptor recognition and EBV
entry.

whereas

To further confirm different roles of quercetin
and isoliquiritigenin in EBV life cycle, HEK293 cells
based EBV in vitro infection system was applied to
determine how quercetin or isoliquiritigenin affect EBV
latency [31]. HEK293-EBV-GFP cells are derived from
HEK293 cells by infecting with EBV recombinant virus.
Measurement of the FITC emission from FACS Aria III
helps determine the cytometric profile of EBV latency
in HEK293-EBV-GFP cells treated with either quercetin
or isoliquiritigenin (Figure 9). The assay demonstrated
that quercetin treatment decreased FITC emission up to
11%, suggesting weakness of EBV latent replication, and
isoliquiritigenin increased FITC emission up to 18%,
suggesting reinforcement of EBV latent replication. The
results obtained from HEK293 cell system also supported
the different roles of quercetin or isoliquiritigenin on EBV
life cycles.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed that both quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin isolated from licorice have distinguished
antitumor or antiviral activities against gastric carcinoma
and EBV. Given our observations, antitumor and antiviral
effects of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin were followed.
CD50 values of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin were 62 μM
and 45 μM against SNU719 cells, respectively (Figure 1).
Quercetin induced a strong early apoptosis and necrosis/
late apoptosis in SNU719 cells (Figure 2). Quercetin
significantly arrested S/G2 transition of SNU719 cells,
whereas isoliquiritigenin did not impact on the cell cycle
progress (Figure 3). Quercetin showed demethylation
in cellular and viral genomes (Figure 4). Quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin appeared to induce signal transductions
linked to apoptosis, such as MAPK/JNK pathway and
MAPK/ERK pathway (Figure 5). Quercetin upregulated
noticeably EBV lytic genes such as BZLF1, BRLF1 and
BLLF1, while isoliquiritigenin upregulated markedly EBV
latent genes such as LMP1, LMP2, EBNA3A and EBNA1
(Figure 6). Quercetin enhanced to produce BZLF1, yet
isoliquiritigenin remarkably induced to produce LMP2A
(Figure 7). Frequency of EBV promoter use was affected
by compounds isolated from licorice. Quercetin enhanced
Fp frequency than Qp, but isoliquiritigenin preferred Qp
to Fp (Figure 8). EBV latency was weakened by quercetin,
but it was reinforced by isoliquiritigenin (Figure 9). Only
quercetin stimulated to produce EBV progeny viruses
from SNU719 cells (Figure 10). Interestingly, infection
of EBV from lymphocyte to gastric adenocarcinoma cells
was severely inhibited by quercetin, while the infection

Quercetin more increases the EBV progeny
production than isoliquiritigenin
Because most EBV genes tested were regulated by
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin, we next asked whether these
two compounds stimulated EBV progeny production.
Therefore, EBV intracellular and extracellular genome
copy numbers were evaluated using previous described
methods [14, 29]. Intracellular EBV genome copy numbers
were not affected by treatments with either quercetin or
isoliquiritigenin (Figure 10A), but extracellular EBV
genome copy numbers were significantly increased up to
150% by quercetin treatment (Figure 10B). In addition,
in order to define time kinetics of effects of quercetin or
isoliquritigenin on EBV progeny production, the effects
by two compounds were determined on time course of
SNU719 cells treated with quercetin or isoliquritigenin.
During 48 h time course, quercetin treatment significantly
enhanced EBV progency production since 24 h post
treatment. In contrast, isoliquiritigenin treatment exhibited
almost no effects on EBV progeny production during the
time course (Figure 10C). These results indicated that
quercetin is likely to derive EBV lytic replication and
subsequently to produce EBV progenies from SNU719
cells.

was not affected by isoliquiritigenin (Figure 11).
Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid and
isoliquiritigenin is a flavonoid phytoestrogen from licorice.
Both compounds are highly similar in molecular structures
like analogs; 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy4H-chromen-4-one for quercertin, and (E)-1-(2,4dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one
for isoliquiritigenin (Figure 1A). Thus they were expected
to exhibit similar effect on cancer and oncoviral infection.
Certainly, both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are known

to induce apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells
[48-53]. Both compounds showed to downregulate antiapoptic factors such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 and
cleavage caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP. They also
demonstrated to downregulate cell-cycle essential factors
such as CDK2, CDK6, cyclin D, cyclin E and cyclin A.
Several mechanisms were reported to trigger the apoptosis
caused by treatment of quercetin and isoliquritignin. One
is to induce apoptosis by blocking of PI3K/AKT pathway
that tends to upregulate anti-apoptotic factors [19, 53].

Another is to induce apoptosis by arresting cell cycle at
G0, G1, and G2 phases [54, 55]. The other is to cause
apoptosis by activating endoplasmic reticulum stresssignaling pathway [56, 57]. The last is to cause apoptosis
by activating JNK/ERK pathway [48, 58]. However, there
might be other mechanisms to induce apoptosis. Based on
our study, quercetin was likely to induce apoptosis through
JNK/ERK pathway.
SNU719 cells used in our study were derived
from EBV associated gastric carcinoma, and thus EBV
is latently infected in the SNU719 cells. Quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin showed remarkably different signaling
patterns on inducing apoptosis in SNU719 cells at 50%
cytotoxic dose (CD50). Quercetin produced clearer cleaved
PARP and stronger activation of JNK pathway than
isoliquiritigenin, even though both compounds caused to
lose cell membrane asymmetry and integrity. Thus, it was
concluded that isoliquiritigenin did not cause significant
apoptosis from SNU719 cells.
There could be at least three factors that cause

the different effects on apoptosis. First, it could be that
isoliquiritigenin does not work as ligands for TNF-R1
to induce apoptosis from SNU719 cells. Second, as the
genome of SNU719 cell is known to heavily methylated
[42], it could be so methylated most signaling pathways
including JNK/ERK pathway that these pathways
might be silenced by methylation on CpG islands of
transcriptional factors essential to apoptosis induction.
This methylation mediated silencing may be a reason why
isoliquiritigenin did not induce apoptosis from SNU719
cells. Indeed, quercetin showed to reduce DNMTs
expression through downregulating of STAT3 signaling
pathway and consequently decrease methylation on
Fp/Qp region (Figure 4). Thus, it is possible that some
hypermethylated genes essential for apoptosis induction
may be demethylated and active for gene expression by
quercetin treatment.
Third, in some points of views, signaling
pathways could to support different roles of quercetin
or isoliquiritigenin on cellular apoptosis. Activation

cells was conducted to determine if treatments of quercetin or isoliquiritigenin affect EBV infection. (A) EBV could transfer from LCLEBV cells to AGS cells using cell to cell coculture infection system. AGS cells infected EBV-GFP virus were in attached form and GFP
florescent. (B) As a donor, LCL-EBV-GFP cells (LCL-2266-36) was cocultured with AGS cells seeded previously. CD50s of quercetin
and isoliquiritigenin against AGS cells were determined as 62 and 58 µM, respectively. These CD50 values, 62 μM quercetin and 45 μM
isoliquiritigenin were applied to define their effect on EBV infection. Compared of DMSO treatment (negative control), quercetin intensively
suppressed the transfer of EBV from LCL-EBV-GFP cells to AGS cells, meaning inhibition of EBV infection to gastric epithelial cells. (C)
However, isoliquiritigenin treatment did not cause any effect on the EBV horizontal infection. Statistical significance is when the P-value
is < 0.05 (95% confidence). ISL and QST stands for isoliquiritigenin and quercetin, respectively.

of MAPK/JNK pathway by both quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin supported the induction of necrosis/late
apoptosis by quercetin or isoliquiritigenin because JNK
pathway is tightly linked to apoptosis induction pathway
[40]. In addition, downregulation of glucocorticoid
pathway by quercetin could support the induction of
apoptosis by quercertin because glucocorticoid is known
to trans-repress AP-1 that transduces signals for apoptosis
[44]. Downregulation of interferon regulatory factor
1 pathway (IRF1) by isoliquiritigenin could result in
the reduction of apoptosis by isoliquiritigenin because
IRF1 is known to induce apoptosis [45]. Taken together,
our study clearly showed different effects of quercetin
and isoliquiritigenin on inducing apoptosis in SNU719
cells. Furthermore, we can’t rule out possibility that
isoliquiritigenin does not induce apoptosis in SNU719
cells in which quercetin causes strong apoptosis. Fourth,
given that both compounds can induce similar apoptosis is
in most cancer cells as reported by many previous studies
[41-46], we could speculate that EBV latently infected
SNU719 cells might play a pivotal role in inducing
apoptosis by quercetin. As one of speculations, EBV is
known to produce anti-apoptotic factors that possibly
contribute to evade apoptosis of EBV infected host cells
[59]. Isoliquiritigenin might downregulate these antiapoptotic EBV genes that subsequently produce weaker
apoptosis of SNU719 cells, compared to quercetin. It
is definitely necessary to dissect further downstream
mechanisms for apoptosis by both compounds.
Like to antitumor effects, it was observed different
antiviral effects between quercetin and isoliquiritigenin
[11, 13, 15, 26]. Consistent with previous studies,
our study also observed antiviral effects of quercetin
and isoliquiritigenin. In particular, quercetin plays an
important role in producing EBV progeny viruses from
SNU719 cells, while isoliquiritigenin plays a clear role
in maintaining EBV latency in SNU719 cells. Indeed,
quercetin treatment led to produce a large quantity of EBV
progeny viruses in SNU719 cells, and then it raised abrupt
release of many EBV particles from host cells. This abrupt
release of a large quantity of EBV progeny virus might
contribute to cause to lyse host cell plasma membrane.
This lysis might trigger next level of apoptosis which
isoliquiritigenin can’t cause. However, these speculations
should be tested in further studies to get them more
convinced.
Interestingly, quercetin almost completely
prevented EBV from infecting neighbor AGS cells, while
isoliquiritigenin did not inhibit EBV to infect the AGS
cells. Quercetin seemed to be a potent apoptosis inducing
agents at 50% cytotoxicity dose against AGS cells.
Apoptosis is likely to losing cell membrane asymmetry
that impacts to disrupt adequate receptors for EBV entry
such as CD21, CD35 and HLAII [2]. Ultimately, loss of
EBV receptors on AGS cells resulted in the loss of EBV
infection from LCL to AGS cells.

Both quercetin and isolquritigenin were reported
to induce cell apoptosis through cell cycle arrest in
various human-derived tumor cells. The inhibitory effect
of quercetin or isolquritigenin on cell cycle progression
seems to be mediated by down-regulation of cyclins and
Cdk proteins [53, 60, 61]. Interestingly, our study shows
that quercetin has much stronger effect on cell cycle
arrest than isolquiritigenin (Figure 3). In fact, the effect
of quercetin on the expression of EBV-derived proteins
is little investigated. We found that quercetin could
stimulate the lytic induction of EBV through up-regulated
expression of BLLF1, BZLF1 and BRLF1, which is shown
in Figure 6. Kudoh et al. reported that the induction of
EBV lytic activation completely arrested cell cycle
progression in p21, p53-independent way [62]. Moreover,
the cell cycle arrest by quercetin has been reported to
associate with the induction of apoptosis as well as
prevention of liver carcinogenesis [55]. A couple of other
studies also described the correlation between EBV lytic
cycle activation and cell cycle arrest [29]. Therefore, we
postulate that quercetin inhibits cell cycle progression
much more vigorously than isoliquiritigenin because of
direct activation of quercetin on EBV lytic replication,
which is not seen by isoliquiritigenin.
Based on all findings in this study, a working
model for molecular mechanism used by quercetin and
isoliquiritigenin for antitumor and antiviral activities could
be suggested. Quercetin downregulates the expression
of DNMTs in a STAT3-independent manner. Due to the
lack of DNMTs, demethylation occurs on SNU719 and
EBV genome. These demethyated locuses may include
CpG motifs in SNU719 JNK and EBV BZLF1 genes.
Upon being demethylated by quercetin treatment, JNK
and BZLF1 genes tend to be active and play key roles in
inducing apoptosis and EBV lytic replication. On the other
hand, isoliquiritigenin failed to downregulate DNMTs in
SNU719 cells. Thus a plenty of DNMTs expression would
lead to maintain anti-apoptotic capacity of SNU719 cells
and EBV latency.
Roots from licorice are most popularly used as
pharmacological sources for treatment of certain disorders
[10]. This is because the root is known to contain rich
reserves of biologically effective compounds such as
glycyrrhizic acid, Glycyrrhetinic acid, lincoricidin,
isoliquiritigenin, quercetin and etc [12]. Our study tested
if quercetin or isoliquiritigenin were effective for antiviral
and antitumor activities and determined that quercetin is
intensively potent to antiviral effects through apoptosis.
Thus, licorice roots containing quercetin can be used to
protect host cells from EBV infection and EBV associated
disorders. In terms of developing licorice as medicinal
food, one of future studies must focus on determining
if licorice roots are clinically effective in protecting
cancer development or EBV infection from patients. This
novel study highlights a fundamental possibility of the
development of licorice roots as a medicinal food in order

of cell suspension (1 × 104 cells/well) was seeded and
then treated with various concentrations (0-1000 µM)
of quercetin or isoliquiritigenin. After 0 h, 24 h and 48
h of quercetin or isoliquiritigenin treatment, 10 µl of
CCK-8 solution was added to each sample. Samples were
incubated for another 3 h, and the absorbance of each
cell suspension was then measured using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay reader. All steps followed
the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. In addition,
to determine on time course cell viabilities, cell counting
assay using trypan blue staining was conducted. Trypan
blue is one of several stains recommended for use in dye
exclusion procedures for viable cell counting. This assay
is based on the principle that live (viable) cells do not take
up certain dyes, whereas dead (non-viable) cells do [33].
Cell viability was calculated as percentage of live cells
relative to total cells.

Intracellular and extracellular EBV genomic DNA
copy number quantification
Following lysis and sonication using a Bioruptor
sonicator (Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan; 5 min, 30-s on/
off pulses), genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from
either 62 µM quercetin or 45 µM isoliquiritigenin for
different time courses. Each resultant gDNA (50 ng) was
subjected to qPCR analysis, and the relative amount of
EBV gDNA was determined using the internal control
Actin. Intracellular EBV copy number was calculated as
the relative amount of EBV gDNA in the total gDNA. To
determine the relative extracellular EBV copy number, 20ml culture medium samples were collected from SNU719
cells treated with either quercetin or isoliquiritigenin. The
culture medium samples were filtered through a 0.45nm syringe filter, loaded onto a 20% sucrose cushion in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, and subjected
to ultracentrifugation (CP100WX, Hitachi) at 27,000 rpm
for 90 min. The virus pellet was lysed in 100 µl of FA lysis
buffer [EDTA (1 mM, pH 8.0), HEPES-KOH (50 mM, pH
7.5), and NaCl (140 mM)], sonicated using a Bioruptor
sonicator for 5 min (30-s on/off pulses), and DNA was
extracted. Finally, viral DNA was resuspended in 100 µl of
RNase-free water and qPCR analysis was used to quantify
viral DNAs by using primer sets specific for EBV EBNA1.

Western blot analysis
To assess if quercetin or isoliquiritigenin impact on
EBV protein synthesis, Western blotting was performed in
SNU719 or AGS cells treated with 62 µM quercetin or 45
µM isoliquiritigenin. Treated SNU719 cells were harvested
using trypsin in 0 h, 24 h and 48 h post treatment. Cells (10
× 106) were then lysed using 100 µl of reporter lysis buffer
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) supplemented with 1 µl
of proteinase inhibitor and 10 µl of phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. The cell lysates were further fractionated using
the Bioruptor sonicator (5 min, 30-s on/off pulses). When
necessary, the cell lysates were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Cell lysates (25 µl) were
loaded onto 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
electrophoresis gel and subjected to Western blot analysis
by using antibodies against EBV proteins (1:1000
dilution). Following antibodies were used: anti-EBV
EBNA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA),
anti-EBV BZLF1(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EBV
LMP2A(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DNMT1(Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DNMT3A(Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-PARP(Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA, USA), anti-SAPK/JNK(Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK(Cell Signaling

anti-GAPDH(Cell Signaling Technology), anti-STAT3
(Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-phospho-Stat3(Cell
Signaling Technology). Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosiences,
Glattbrugg, Switzerland), horseradish peroxidase-

Cell cycle analysis
To assess if quercetin or isoliquiritigenin affect cell
cycle progression in SNU719 cells, they were treated with
quercetin and isoliquiritigenin, stained with propidium
iodide (PI) solution for 48 h, and then subjected to cell
cycle analysis by using a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD
Bioscience; San Jose, CA, USA). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells
were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes and cultured
overnight. On the following day, cells were treated with
62 µM quercetin or 45 µM isoliquiritigenin. The cells
were harvested using trypsin at 48 h post-treatment,
washed with cold PBS, fixed in 95% ethanol for at least
1 h, treated with 300 µg of RNase A, stained in 10× PI
solution, and finally analyzed for cell cycle progress by
using a FACSAria III cell sorter. Dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) was used as mock in each treatment.

conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham
Biosiences), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rat IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA)
were used as secondary antibodies.

To determine if quercetin or isoliquiritigenin affect
the selection of EBV promoter usage, we performed
conventional PCR on cDNA isolated from SNU719 cells
treated with 62 µM quercetin or 45 µM isoliquiritigenin.
Total RNA was extracted from SNU719 cells treated with
quercetin or isoliquiritigenin by using an RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen), and RNA was then synthesized into cDNA
using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase. As controls,
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA collected from
KEM1 and KEM3 cells, which are EBV latency type 1
and 3 Burkitt lymphoma cells, respectively [36]. Primer
sequences, including those for actin, EBV Qp, EBV Cp/
Wp, and EBV Fp, were published previously [31] and
listed in Table 1. cDNA was amplified in 25-μl reactions
containing 5 μl of 5× reaction mix, 5 μl of 5× TuneUp
solution, 1 μl of Taq-plus polymerase, and 2.5 μl of 10 μM
of forward/reverse primer. The following cycle conditions
were used: 95°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 10 s,
55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 10 min; followed by 72°C for
10 min. The reactions were performed using a TaKaRa
PCR Thermal Cycler and then run on a 1.5% agarose/TBE
gel.

Apoptosis and membrane integrity analysis
To determine whether quercetin or isoliquiritigenin
induced apoptosis and membrane integrity of SNU719
cells, an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection assay was
conducted. Briefly, 5 ml of SNU719 cells (1 × 106) was
seeded in a 6-cm plate, and treated with 62 µM quercetin
or 45 µM isoliquiritigenin (CD50 value) on the following
day. After 48 h of treatment, cells were stained using FITC
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen,
San Jose, CA, USA), and were then analyzed early
apoptosis, necrosis/late apoptosis, and membrane integrity
of SNU719 cells using a FACSAria III cell sorter 1 h poststaining.

Methylation-specific PCR
To determine if quercetin or isoliquiritigenin affect
tumor suppressor gene methylation in SNU719 cells, a
methylation-specific PCR assay was performed using
DNA subjected to bisulfite conversion as described
previously [34]. Following lysis and sonication by using a
Bioruptor sonicator (5 min, 30 s on/off pulses), gDNA was
extracted from SNU719 cells treated with 62 µM quercetin
or 45 µM isoliquiritigenin. We used the CpGenome DNA
Modification Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for
sodium bisulphite conversion of the DNA. The sequences
of the BCL7A primers used are shown in Table 1. Each
25-μl reaction contained 5 µl of bisulfite-treated DNA
template, 5 μl of 5× reaction mix (NanoHelix, Daejeon,
Korea), 5 μl of 5× TuneUp solution (NanoHelix), 1 μl
of Taq-plus polymerase (NanoHelix), and 2.5 μl of 10
μM forward/reverse primer. Primers were specific for
methylated and unmethylated BCL7A. The primer pairs
specific for regions upstream and downstream of C and W
promoters (Cp/Wp) as well as upstream and downstream
of F and Q promoters (Fp/Qp) are listed in Table 1. The
following cycle conditions were used: 95°C for 3 min;
30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for
30 s; followed by 72°C for 10 min. The reactions were
performed using a TaKaRa PCR Thermal Cycler (Otsu,
Japan) and then run on a 1.5% agarose/TBE gel. Resultant
bands on agarose gels were quantitated by densitometric
analysis using ImageQuant 5.2 [35]. Intensities of all
bands on agarose gel were summed to make total band
intensity. The intensity of each band was relatively
evaluated compared to the total band intensity.

Gammaherpesvirus infection
To determine whether quercetin or isoliquiritigenin
affect EBV infection of AGS cells (gastric carcinoma),
we performed cell-to-cell coinfection by using AGS and
LCL-EBV-GFP B-cell lymphocyte cells. LCL-EBV-GFP
B-cell lymphocyte cells were obtained from Lieberman’s
lab [37]. AGS cells [38] (0.625 × 106/well) were seeded
in 6-well plates (Corning, NY, USA). The following day,
AGS cell culture medium-RPMI1640 (Hyclone, Logan,
UT, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone),
antibiotics/antimycotics, and Glutamax-was replaced with
fresh medium, AGS cells were overlaid with LCL-EBVGFP cells (1.25 × 106/ml), and were treated with 62 µM
quercetin or 58 µM isoliquiritigenin for 72 h. CD50s of
quercetion and isoliquiritigenin against AGS cells were
determined as 62 and 58 µM, respectively. These CD50
values were applied to this EBV infection assay using AGS
cells. 72 hours post-coinfection, we completely removed
the medium and washed the cells twice with PBS, leaving
only AGS-EBV-GFP cells. Bacto agar (1.5%) containing
2× RPMI1640 (Hyclone) supplemented with 20% FBS
(Hyclone), antibiotics/antimycotics, and Glutamax was
applied to the infected AGS-EBV-GFP cells. After 72
h of incubation, we counted GFP foci formed on AGS
cells treated with either compounds or control treatment
(Dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO).

To determine what SNU719 cell signaling pathways
were affected by quercetin or isoliquiritigenin treatment,
a Cignal Finder Multi-Pathway Reporter Array (Qiagen,
catalog number CCA-901L) was used. Attractene (1 µl/
well) was distributed into a 96-well Cignal Finder MultiPathway Reporter Array plate. SNU719 cell suspension
was diluted in Opti-MEM medium and then seeded in each
well. Cells were treated with either 62 µM quercetin or
45 µM isoliquiritigenin on the following day. After 48 h
of treatment, reverse transfection reagent and Opti-MEM
medium were removed. Dual-Glo Luciferase Reagent
(75 µl) was then added to each well and plates were
incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, firefly
and renilla luciferase activities were measured following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, 75 µl of
firefly luciferase reagent was added to each well and then
luciferase activity was measured. Afterwards, 75 µl of
Dual-Glo Stop&Glo luciferase reagent was added to each
well and renilla luciferase activity was measured.
