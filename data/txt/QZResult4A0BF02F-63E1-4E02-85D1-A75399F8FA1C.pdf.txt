Abstract
Reversing abnormal gene silencing in cancer cells due to DNA hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands may
offer new cancer prevention or therapeutic approaches. Moreover, such approaches may be broadly applicable to
enhance the efﬁcacy of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate the powerful
utility of a novel gene reporter system to permit studies of the dynamics, mechanisms, and translational relevance
of candidate therapies of this type in human colon cancer cells. The reporter system is based on in situ
modiﬁcation of the endogenous locus of the tumor-suppressor gene SFRP1, a pivotal regulator of the Wnt pathway
that is silenced by DNA hypermethylation in many colon cancers. The modiﬁed SFRP1-GFP reporter allele used
remained basally silent, like the unaltered allele, and it was activated only by drug treatments that derepress gene
silencing by reversing DNA hypermethylation. We used the established DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)
5-aza-deoxycitidine (DAC) to show how this system can be used to address key questions in the clinical
development of epigenetic cancer therapies. First, we deﬁned conditions for which clinically relevant dosing could
induce sustained induction of RNA and protein. Second, we found that, in vivo, a more prolonged drug exposure
than anticipated was essential to derepress gene silencing in signiﬁcant cell numbers, and this has implications
for generating effective anticancer responses in patients with hematopoietic or solid tumors. Finally, we
discovered how histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) alone, when administered to cells actively replicating
DNA, can robustly reexpress the silenced gene with no change in promoter methylation status. Taken together,
our ﬁndings offer a new tool and insights for devising optimal clinical experiments to evaluate DNMTi and HDACi,
alone or in combination, and with other cancer treatments, as agents for the epigenetic management and
prevention of cancer. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3834–43. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The role of epigenetic abnormalities as drivers of tumorigenesis has been increasingly recognized in recent years (1–3).
Hundreds of genes in individual cancers are known to be
differentially silenced in association with DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions (1–3). A key group of
these genes is known to function as tumor suppressors (1–3).
Targeted reversal of tumor suppressor gene silencing is an
attractive strategy for cancer prevention and therapy (4–6). A
substantial effort is now under way to use existing drugs, and

develop new drugs, for this purpose (7). These efforts will
require quantitative, high-throughput screening systems for
drug identiﬁcation and reﬁnement, and for understanding how
such drugs might be optimally used.
Previous approaches to this problem have used exogenous
reporter gene systems in which the introduced construct is
DNA methylated before cell introduction (8). This exogenous
reporter approach does not necessarily mimic promoters in
their endogenous setting in cancer cells with respect to sequential events for acquisition of the aberrant DNA methylation
and/or numerous regional chromatin modiﬁcations, which
contribute to the evolution and maintenance of this gene
silencing. Herein, we describe a human colon cancer cell system
in which a ﬂuorescence-based reporter has been homologously
recombined into an exon region of a tumor-suppressor gene
downstream from its endogenous, DNA hypermethylated, promoter region. The reporter then remains silenced until drug
induced reexpression, which can be monitored at the single-cell
level, by multiple assay approaches. We provide ﬁrst examples of
how we have used this system for deriving new, highly translationally relevant, insights into the actions of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase–inhibiting
(HDACi) drugs. The ﬁndings should prove important for better
utilizing such drugs in the clinic, alone and together.

Recombinant Reporter for DNA-Hypermethylated Gene

Materials and Methods
Construction of the SFRP1-GFP recombinant reporter
system
The recombinant construct uses an AAV shuttle vector in
which both 700 bp 50 and 1,000 bp 30 homologous arms ﬂanking
the SFRP1 gene and the CpG island in the proximal promoter
region were inserted from wild-type (WT) Hct116 genomic
DNA (Supplementary Fig. S1). PCR reactions were used to
assemble, between the arms, Lox sites ﬂanking a TK-NeoR
cassette, and internal ribosomal entry sequences (IRES) preceding the GFP gene (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). The total
insert size for the above elements is 4.7 kb. This recombinant
AAV vector was then cotransfected, using Lipofectamine 2000,
into AAV-293 cells with recombinant pAAV-RC and pHelper
sequences to produce AAV virus particles, which were then
used to infect WT Hct116 cells at 37 C for 2 to 3 hours. Cells
were then neomycin selected to be screened for clones positive
for proper recombinants as validated by the PCR strategy
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Two clones with the proper
insertion of the construct into exon 2, #90 and #1.4, of endogenous SRFP 1 were selected for all further studies. To activate
the Lox sites and delete the NeoR sequences between these, the
recombinant clones were infected with virus containing Cre
recombinase.
FACS analysis
Using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer,
expression of the SFRP1-GFP allele, was measured as maximum ﬂuorescent intensities before and after drug treatments, and responses were recorded as the percentage
numbers of GFP-positive cells. We also used this technology,
in selected experiments, to sort for GFP-positive and -negative cells. In selected experiments, we compared the GFP
signals with signals from cells treated with 10 mmol/L 5ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU; Invitrogen) to assess the status of cells for DNA synthesis and compare this with levels of
SFRP1-GFP expression. Because the buffer for detection of
EdU contents CuSO4, which induces ﬂuorescence quenching,
cells were always sorted ﬁrst for GFP before analyses for
detecting EdU. In all of these studies, we also assessed cells
stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) for detecting
and quantitating cell nuclei and cell-cycle position by FACS
analysis. For every experiment, we used a GFP-negative cell
line control versus drug-treated GFP-positive cells to gate
and set the boundary for negative versus positive GFP cells
after drug treatments.
Time lapse video microscopy
For selected studies, we monitored drug induction of
SFRP-GFP expression over a time course by performing
timed video microscopy, using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E
camera combined with a NIS-Elements AR 3.10 program, in
the Imaging Core facility in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Frames were captured at 15-minute intervals with
magniﬁcation of 20. For analysis of percent positive cells at
each time point, TIFF format pictures were counted for all
cells in the ﬁeld.

Cell culture and drug treatment
All culturing of HCT116 cells was performed in McCoy
medium with 10% FBS. 5-aza-deoxycitidine (DAC) treatment
conditions varied with experimental questions but doses ranged from 50 to 500 nmol/L, generally administered daily with
fresh drug and medium each day. The HDACi, trichostatin
(TSA), was given at doses of 300 nmol/L for 24 hours.
DNA extraction and DNA methylation analysis
DNA extraction and bisulﬁte conversion were performed
with the EZ DNA Methylation Kit from Zymo Research.
Methylation-speciﬁc PCR (MSP) analysis was performed as
previously described using primers located in the endogenous
promoter CpG island of SFRP1 with a product size of 126 bp
(9, 10).
Real-time PCR
RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and converted to
cDNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR assays were
performed on a Bio-Rad Real-Time PCR System using SYBR
Green Mix (Bio-Rad) for detection. All mRNA levels were
normalized for endogenous SFRP1, or for SFRP1-GFP
sequences, to levels for GAPDH using qRT values for 40 cycles
without addition of SuperScript III as a zero point. The sFRP1
product is of 156 bp and PCR primers are located in exon1
(catgcagttcttcggcttct) and exon 2 (gatttcaactcgttgtcacagg).
For SFRP-GFP, the product is of 192 bp and primers are located
inside the recombinant GFP sequences, (catccccgactacttcaagc/cccatggtcttcttctgcat).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells (106 per assay) were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde (Sigma). Nuclear extracts were obtained using the
CEBN buffer (11, 12) and sonication was performed for using
30 cycles (10 seconds, on; 30 seconds, off). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed overnight at 4 C using
50 to 80 mg chromatin DNA and four different antibodies
(from Millipore) consisting of an IgG control, histone H3,
H3K4me3, and H3K27me3, respectively. This was followed
by incubation with Dynal Magnetic beads (Invitrogen) for 3
hours and then by two washes each with low-salt buffer,
high-salt buffer, and LiCl buffer. Chromatin-associated DNA
was then eluted from the beads during a 65 C overnight
incubation with 50 mmol/L NaHCO3 buffer with 1% SDS to
reverse the crosslinks. IP-speciﬁc products were then ampliﬁed using previously reported (11) RT-PCR forward and
reverse primers (gcaccgcagctagagaaccga/ctgcttcctaatttcaaccaacagccc) located in the sFRP1 proximal promoter region
(770 to 700 bp relative to transcription start site).
In vivo studies of response to DAC and
immunocytochemistry studies
Hct116-sFRP1-GFP (#1.4) cells, 106 per site, were injected
subcutaneously into two ﬂank sites per mouse using 6-weeks
old, female, NOD-SCID mice. Ten mice were used, each, for
mock and DAC treatment experiments using 0.5 mg/kg DAC
for 5 days per week for 4 weeks. Palpable tumors were allowed
to form before treatment was begun. Five mice were sacriﬁced

paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 C, followed by immersion in
30% sucrose for 10 to 12 hours. Frozen sections (20 mm) were
cut using cryostats and mounted on slides. Portions of sections
were prepared on coverslips and stained with the antifade
DAPI reagent (Life Technologies) and also used for GFP
ﬂuorescence detection. Companion slides were used for immunocytochemistry (ICC) with incubation with anti-GFP antibody (1:1,000; Life Technologies; A11122) at 4 C overnight. For
controls, samples were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated
IgG at room temperature for 3 hours.

Results
Construction of the model system
Our reporter system was derived using gene targeting for an
allele of SFRP1 in the colorectal cancer cell line, HCT 116. This
tumor-suppressor gene, which can inhibit Wnt signaling (13),
is transcriptionally silenced in association with promoter, CpG
island, and DNA hypermethylation in this cell line, as it is very
frequently in colorectal cancer and other cancers types (10, 14).
To introduce a reporter tag directly into this locus, we used a
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)–based approach
(15) to disrupt the native second exon with a construct containing a neomycin transferase minigene driven by a highly
active thymidine kinase (TK) promoter plus a GFP reporter
downstream of this drug selection cassette (Fig. 1A). This neo
cassette is ﬂanked by LoxP sites to facilitate its excision
following transient expression of Cre recombinase. An IRES
was positioned 50 to the GFP open reading frame, facilitating its
expression as a bicistronic element. This approach allowed
selection of neo-expressing cells in which the construct had
homologously recombined at the SFRP1 locus (Fig. 1A). Following the identiﬁcation and expansion of the desired recombinant clones, the neo cassette was excised to create tran-

scriptional competence for the GFP allele after infection of
target cells with Cre recombinase–expressing adenovirus. The
resulting cells, however, should exhibit little or no detectable
basal expression of GFP before any drug treatment due to
maintenance of the silenced state of the recombinant SFRP1
allele in association with its aberrant, CpG island, DNA hypermethylation (Fig. 1A). This is, in fact, the case as only after
treatment of the HCT 116 cells with the DNA-demethylating
agent, DAC, can we detect reactivated expression of the SFRP1GFP allele (Fig. 1B), and this occurs concomitantly with partial
DNA demethylation of SFRP1 alleles (Fig. 1C). The fact that
both WT and recombinant alleles maintain a basal status of
dense DNA methylation is indicated by a lack of any signal for
non-DNA–methylated alleles by the very sensitive, MSP assay
being used for the present studies (Fig. 1C). Previous comparisons of MSP to extensive bisulﬁte sequencing for the DNA
methylation of the promoter sequences being studied indicates
that methylated signal in the absence of any unmethylated
signal is seen for the MSP assay of SFRP1 alleles only when
dense DNA methylation is present (10, 14).
Quantiﬁcation and timing of DAC-induced SFRP1-GFP
expression
The SFRP1-GFP expression in the above studies can be
precisely quantiﬁed, as monitored by FACS ﬂow analysis, for
protein levels and timing of gene reactivation by varying
doses of the drug (Fig. 2A and B). Using a typical protocol for
in vitro DAC-induced reactivation of hypermethylated genes
in which 0.01 to 1.0 mmol/L drug is administered daily in
fresh media to offset its short half-life in aqueous solution,
for 3 days, the number of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 2A) and the
overall ﬂuorescence intensity (Fig. 2B) both peaked at 3 days
after the start of DAC treatment and then fell progressively
thereafter. This is a time course typically observed for RNA
expression of DNA-hypermethylated genes in this type of

(Continued.) C, MSP analysis of the DNA methylation status of the endogenous SFRP1 promoter (M, methylated alleles; U, unmethylated alleles) was
performed for HCT116 WT cells and the two clones with the recombinant SFRP1-GFP allele after Cre recombination. HCT 116 DKO cells were used as
controls for complete demethylation of the SFRP1 promoter and have a genetic knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B.  lanes, no DAC treatment; þ lanes, DAC
treatment; dH2O, control with MSP primers, but no DNA templates. MSP primers for unmethylated and methylated sequences are those previously reported

short-term protocol using delivery of fresh drug and fresh
media every 24 hours (10).
Unlike in the standard protocol above with media change
daily, when DAC is used in patients as cancer therapy, nutrient
supply to tumor is initially constant as is the cycling time of
tumor-cell subpopulations. Furthermore, half-life of the drug
in the cancer cells, and especially once incorporated into DNA,
is likely much longer. We could test for different such conditions using the property of our system of allowing time-lapse
ﬂuorescence microscopy. With such an approach, some surprisingly different and probably clinically important differences in timing and kinetics for activation of the recombinant
SFRP1-GFP allele are detected in response to a relatively low
dose of 500 nmol/L. Thus, after a single-day dose, followed by a
media change at 24 hours, cells positive for GFP expression
reached 14% by 5 days (Fig. 3A). However, if media are not
changed after this dose, GFP expression is more progressive
and levels of approximately 36% cells are achieved by 5 days
(Fig. 3B). Without media change after 3 days of drug administration, 53% of cells were positive at 5 days (Fig. 3C). Thus, the
colon cancer cells without fresh media addition, and with only
very short drug administration, are capable of progressively
reexpressing SFRP1-GFP far beyond the 3-day peak seen in the
usual protocols.
Use of the model to explore the effects of HDACi on
SFRP1-GFP expression
We next used our reporter system to study features of a
laboratory paradigm, which is being tested in clinical trials
(5, 10, 14, 16–19), in which DNA demethylating agents and

3838

HDACis are combined for reexpression of DNA-hypermethylated genes (14, 16). Cancer genes with densely DNA-hypermethylated CpG island promoters generally will not reactivate
well with administration of HDACis alone, but these drugs can
provide additive or synergistic effects if given after a DNAdemethylating agent (14, 16). When examined at the protein
level as quantitated for our reporter system by FACS analysis,
and when compared with RNA results by RT-PCR, TSA augments SFRP1-GFP reactivation at all DAC doses ranging from
0.01 to 1 mmol/L (Fig. 4A).
A recent study, using an exogenous reporter system, challenges the paradigm that HDACis cannot, alone, reexpress
DNA-hypermethylated cancer genes and ﬁnds that the DNA
methylation rather limits sustained expression by facilitating
rerecruitment of repressive chromatin (8). We now use our
system to ﬁnd that this situation is even more complex and
that reexpression with HDACi alone fully depends on a window
of vulnerability determined by cells having active DNA replication. In this regard, we do observe conditions under which
TSA treatment alone can and cannot reactivate our silenced
gene with promoter DNA methylation. In time-lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy where media are not changed after a single
24-hour administration of 300 nmol/L TSA, cells remain viable
over a 5-day period (Fig. 4B and C). When seeded at high
density, where little proliferation occurs before and after 24
hours of TSA administration, only a very small number of cells
express SFRP1-GFP, and this number then decreases rapidly
(Fig. 4B). In striking contrast, when seeded at low density,
SFRP1-GFP expression increases steadily from 24 hours, reaching a much higher and stable peak over 2 to 4 days before

declining slightly at 5 days (Fig. 4C). This dependency of the
cells on seeding density is further highlighted when this study
is quantitatively analyzed (Fig. 4D) and when various seeding
densities are analyzed versus percentage of cells induced by
TSA to express SFRP-GFP (Fig. 4E).
We hypothesized from the immediately above results, that
the low-density conditions might have revealed a previously
not recognized requirement for DNA replication for sustained
gene reexpression after TSA treatment. We studied this for
cells seeded at low density by combining TSA treatment for 24
hours with short exposure to EdU for 2 hours to monitor DNA
replication and subsequent sorting of cells for positive (GFPþ
cells) versus negative (GFP cells) levels (Fig. 5A–D). Indeed,
GFPþ cells after TSA were more than 9-fold enriched for EdU
incorporation than GFP cells, reﬂective of their being in the S
phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 5C and D). Importantly, this S
phase–dependent activity of the drug occurs in the absence of
any change in DNA methylation status in the CpG island
surrounding the transcription start site of SFRP1 for either
the WT or recombinant SFRP1 alleles as we detect no appearance of any methylation signal by the very sensitive MSP assay
(Fig. 5E).
For the above studies of TSA, we also investigated some key
aspects of relevant chromatin changes at the key promoter
sequences of the densely DNA-hypermethylated SFRP1. These
studies are important in assessing whether the basal, chromatin-mediated repression of the recombinant allele is similar
to that for the WT allele before TSA addition. In this regard, we
have previously determined for the WT alleles that even DAC
alone, when inducing reexpression of the silenced gene,
increases histone acetylation at such sites with and without
the addition of TSA (20). Also, the best indication of basal
transcriptional chromatin status for densely DNA-hypermethylated genes is very low levels of the active chromatin
mark, H3K4me2, or H3K4me3 methylation. Also, this mark
increases dramatically when such genes are induced to reexpress with DAC or when a gene that is only very partially DNA
methylated is induced to increase expression with TSA (21).
Indeed, as previously published for promoter sequences for
SFRP1, when these sites are hypermethylated in HCT116 cells
(21, 22), we ﬁnd by ChIP analyses of total cells that promoter
H3K4me3 is very low. This mark increases 3 fold after TSA is
administered to proliferating cells seeded at low density (Fig. 5,
F). Furthermore, we ﬁnd, as previously (21, 22), the repressive
mark H3K27me3 to be readily detectable at these same
sequences and to drop by more than 2-fold with TSA treatment
(Fig. 5, F). The same trends were seen in the sorted high and low
GFP-expressing cells after TSA (Fig. 5, F) but inability in the
experiments to fully purify these cell populations probably
diminishes the detectable differences by the very sensitive
ChIP assays of the chromatin marks.
In these above ChIP studies, we cannot, for certain, separate
the status of the WT alleles from that of endogenous, promoter
sequences in the recombinant SFRP1-GFP alleles. This is
because the distinguishing exogenous sequences for the GFP
cassette in the latter are too far downstream to link to the
above upstream proximal promoter sequences in the ChIP

H3K4me3 and detectable H3K27me3 levels to our previous
analyses of the densely DNA-hypermethylated SFRP1 in WT
HCT116 cells (21, 22) ﬁrmly suggests us that the endogenous
promoter sequences in both the WT and recombinant SFRP1
alleles have a repressed chromatin status in the setting of
retaining dense, basal, DNA hypermethylation.
Use of the model to study the kinetics of DAC-induced
SFRP1-GFP expression in vivo
Our ability to visualize, at the cellular level, the reexpression
of a cancer-speciﬁc DNA-hypermethylated gene offered us the
opportunity to examine DAC-induced reexpression of SFRP1GFP in vivo. The studies offer an important and somewhat
surprising glimpse of a time course for this event during
chronic DAC treatment that may be highly relevant for understanding the use of this drug in cancer therapy.
We treated immune-incompetent mice, bearing established
tumors after HCT 116-SFRP1-GFP cell explanation, with 0.5
mg/kg DAC for 5 days per week for 4 weeks. Tumors were
removed at 2 and 4 weeks during treatment and examined by
monitoring of both GFP ﬂuorescence and immunohistochemistry for GFP (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, only a slight increase in
tumor cells with detectable GFP was seen in DAC versus mock
treated mice after 2 weeks. However, a striking increase in such
cells, as detected by both ﬂuorescence and immunohistochemistry, was observed after 4 weeks of treatment (Fig. 6). These
kinetics, compared with the prolonged time course for
increases in SFRP1-GFP expression in the earlier, in vitro
studies, as discussed further below, may be very important to
clinical use of drugs like DAC in cancer management.

Discussion
We have built an assay system that we suggest has the utility
for rapid, quantitative, and visual readout for effects of "epigenetic therapy" agents on abnormally silenced, DNA-hypermethylated cancer genes. It has already allowed us to suggest
several new aspects about reactivation of such genes in terms
of timing, duration, and DNA synthesis dependency of gene
expression responses to DNA demethylating and HDACis. Our
observations then suggest that our new system may have much
potential for studying how low doses of the drugs studied, and
other drugs, can reprogram cancer cells to provide antitumor
effects. Moreover, it should be extremely useful for providing a
rapid and quantitative readout for high-throughput screens for
new agents, or modiﬁcations of existing agents, which may
beneﬁt efforts to develop epigenetically based strategies for
cancer prevention and treatment.
Our results on timing of DAC effects in our model already
raise important implications for translational use of DNAdemethylating agents and HDACis in the clinic. For DNAdemethylating agents such as DAC, our ﬁndings for a 24-hour
cell exposure followed by no change in culture media versus a
typical 3-day exposure changing drug and media each day are
revealing. The former exposure indicates a much more prolonged response to the short dose than the short half-life of the
drug in aqueous solution would suggest. These in vitro results
are robustly ampliﬁed in the in vivo results depicted in Fig. 6

wherein robust increase in numbers of cells with DAC-induced
expression of SFRP1-GFP occurred only between 2 and 4 weeks
of chronic drug administration at a relatively low, clinically
relevant, dose. All of these results may provide one explanation
for the course of cellular reprogramming results with low doses
of DAC in our recent preclinical studies (7), and in the clinical
responses to DAC in the setting of myelodysplasia/AML of the
elderly (MDS/AML) in which DNA-demethylating agents have
been approved by the FDA for efﬁcacy (6, 23), and for promising
responses in the setting of advanced lung cancer (19). In the
clinic, as well characterized in MDS/AML, patients typically
take multiple cycles of therapy, over 2 to 3 months, before
responses are seen (6, 23). We have speculated from preclinical
work that effect on exhaustion of stem-like cells, kinetics of
drug uptake, etc., might help explain such results. The present
studies, both the in vitro and in vivo studies with our model
system, suggest that another component may be the long
buildup of drug effects on accumulation of cells with reexpression of a silenced, DNA-hypermethylated gene. Although the
half-life of currently used DNA-demethylating agents in therapy is very short in the circulation (6, 23), our studies could
suggest that this may not be the case for targeting DNMTs once
the drugs are incorporated into DNA in dividing cells. This step
is prerequisite for inhibiting the catalytic activity of these
proteins and probably triggering their degradation (24). Our
prolonged cellular effects, and possibly the prolonged course
for therapeutic efﬁcacy might then reﬂect kinetics wherein
cumulative effects on DNA demethylation, and gene reexpression, occur as cells come into cycle during chronic treatment.
Our ﬁndings are also important for considering the application of HDACi to tumor cells and have implications for use of
such agents, alone and in combination with DNA-demethylating agents in the clinic. We now ﬁnd an apparent heavy
dependency for potency of TSA activation of a cancer-speciﬁc,
densely DNA-hypermethylated gene on ongoing DNA replication. Also, the gene reactivation without the loss of DNA

3842

methylation is similar to results achieved with removal of
methyl cytosine–binding protein complexes, which are known
to help mediate transcriptional repression through their interaction with, and targeting of, HDACs to DNA-hypermethylated
genes in cancer cells (25). The mechanisms explaining precisely
how DNA replication and chromatin assembly are altered by
HDAC inhibition in the current paradigm merit much further
investigation. The kinetics demonstrated here indicate that, for
clinical application, the timing for joint administration of
DNA-demethylating drugs and HDACis may have to be heavily
considered. Both drugs may depend on active cell replication
for optimal onset and durability of their effects on reexpression
of DNA-hypermethylated genes. Both also, with different timing, decrease cell replication at some point after their interaction with cancer cells (7, 26, 27). Thus, care may have to be
taken to avoid each drug from interfering with the other in
clinical settings in terms of any efﬁcacy based on their additive
or synergistic effects for gene reexpression.
