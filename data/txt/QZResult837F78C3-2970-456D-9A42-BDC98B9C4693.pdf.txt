Abstract
Recent preclinical evidence has suggested that Ewing Sarcoma (ES) bearing
EWSR1-ETS fusions could be particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPinh) in
combination with DNA damage repair (DDR) agents. Trabectedin is an antitumoral
agent that modulates EWSR1-FLI1 transcriptional functions, causing DNA damage.
Interestingly, PARP1 is also a transcriptional regulator of EWSR1-FLI1, and PARPinh
disrupts the DDR machinery. Thus, given the impact and apparent specificity of both
agents with regard to the DNA damage/DDR system and EWSR1-FLI1 activity in
ES, we decided to explore the activity of combining PARPinh and Trabectedin in in
vitro and in vivo experiments. The combination of Olaparib and Trabectedin was
found to be highly synergistic, inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and
the accumulation of G2/M. The drug combination also enhanced γH2AX intranuclear
accumulation as a result of DNA damage induction, DNA fragmentation and global DDR
deregulation, while EWSR1-FLI1 target expression remained unaffected. The effect of
the drug combination was corroborated in a mouse xenograft model of ES and, more
importantly, in two ES patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in which the tumors
showed complete regression. In conclusion, the combination of the two agents leads
to a biologically significant deregulation of the DDR machinery that elicits relevant
antitumor activity in preclinical models and might represent a promising therapeutic
tool that should be further explored for translation to the clinical setting.

INTRODUCTION

observation in ML, Trabectedin interferes directly
with the chimeric protein EWSR1-FLI1 [12]. In fact,
treatment with Trabectedin specifically deregulates the
transcriptional activity of the chimeric protein [12-14].
Given the impact and apparent specificity of
PARPinh and Trabectedin with regard to the DNA
damage/DDR system and EWSR1-FLI1 activity in ES,
we decided to explore the effects of the combination
through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. We report
that the combination of Trabectedin and Olaparib is highly
synergistic in ES cell lines, inducing major DNA damage
in vitro and in vivo and causing a clinically significant
degree of tumor regression in PDX) models of ES.

ES is an aggressive developmental mesenchymal
tumor [1]. As a result of multimodal therapy, including
strategies from traditional chemotherapeutic agents,
radiotherapy, and surgery, the current cure rate of ES
patients with localized disease is 70% [2, 3]. However,
the survival rate for patients with relapsed, multifocal/
metastatic disease is still less than 20%, mainly due to
development of drug resistance. Recently, a retrospective
study by our group revealed the prognostic value of
chromosome 1 gain (1qG) in ES [4]. Within the upregulated candidate genes identified in 1qG ES, a
particularly interesting gene was found: poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 (PARP1) [4]. Other studies have recently
described that PARP1 plays an important role in tumors
bearing ETS fusions, such as prostate cancer and ES [5, 6].
PARP proteins play a relevant role in the regulation
of the cell cycle, apoptosis, genomic stability, chromatin
remodeling, transcription, tumor growth and even the
induction of chromosomal translocations. PARP1 has
been shown to act as a transcriptional regulator of
EWSR1-FLI1, which has triggered interest in testing
PARPinh in ES [6, 7]. However, the best known activity
of PARP proteins is related to the mechanisms of DDR,
especially regarding the Base Excision repair (BER)
pathway [8]. In brief, the BER is the main pathway
responsible for repairing single-strand breaks (SSB) of
DNA. In the absence of an effective BER mechanism,
SSB accumulation results in Double-Strand Breaks (DSB),
the most lethal form of DNA damage. Globally, when the
DDR machinery fails this produces both an increase in the
frequency of acquired mutations and genomic instability
and both these determine the appearance, evolution and
progression of tumors. In fact, an active DDR machinery
is essential for the physiology of the cell, ensuring its
survival, and is an important mechanism of resistance
to cytotoxic agents. Accordingly, the inhibition of the
DDR in tumor cells provides an excellent therapeutic
opportunity [9]. Inhibitors of the DDR machinery have
been used successfully against tumor cells in monotherapy
or combined with other agents in order to sensitize tumor
cells to the cytotoxic activity of other drugs. Within this
large group of drugs, to date PARPinh represents one of
the most promising subgroup of agents [8, 9]. In this sense,
it has recently been reported that ES cells are defective
in DNA breakage repair systems, being very sensitive to
PARPinh in combination with DNA damaging-drugs [10].
Trabectedin is a marine-derived compound with
proven antitumor activity against several types of
neoplasms, including sarcomas, ovarian, and breast
cancer, among others, by inducing DNA breaks. Clinical
trials have shown that Trabectedin is particularly active
in sarcomas bearing translocations, namely myxoid
Liposarcoma (ML), ES and Synovial Sarcoma [11, 12].
In ES, Grohar et al. showed that, similarly to the previous

RESULTS
ES cells are especially sensitive to olaparib, which
induces G2/M accumulation independently of the
1q status
Initially, we checked the status of PARP1 in a
panel of ES cell lines (Supplementary Table S1) using
a home-made fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
probe specific for PARP1. We observed that ES cell
lines previously described as 1qG in fact showed an
amplification of PARP1 by FISH (Figure 1A). cDNA
analysis showed that all ES cell lines express PARP1 with
different mRNA levels (Figure 1B). Also, using a specific
antibody for PARP1, by Western-blot we observed that
all cell lines studied expressed PARP1 at similar levels,
independently of the 1qG status, (Figure 1C-1D).
We studied the sensitivity of ES cell lines to a group
of PARPinh, including Olaparib, Veliparib and Iniparib.
Olaparib was more active in inhibiting proliferation than
the other two drugs assayed, with lower IC50 levels at 72
hours of exposure (high nM-low μM range, with a median
of 1.995 ± 0.46μM). Veliparib was the second most
effective agent, with IC50 levels of proliferation in the μM
range, with a median of 14.14±2.75μM (approximately 7
fold higher than Olaparib). Finally, Iniparib was the least
effective agent, showing IC50 levels also in the μM range
but with a median of 74.95 ± 5.02μM (approximately
38-fold higher than Olaparib) (Figure 2A). Interestingly,
we observed that after 72 hours of exposure to Olaparib
IC50 levels were higher than those obtained after 6 days
of treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A). Given that
PARP1 is located on chromosome 1q, and in view of our
previous results describing some ES tumors and cell lines
with 1qG, we searched for a correlation between the status
of 1q [Gained or Normal (N)] and Olaparib sensitivity
(Supplementary Figure S1B). We observed a trend towards
a higher sensitivity of 1qG cell lines to Olaparib, but it
was not statistically significant, probably due to the low
number of cell lines analyzed (Mann Whitney U test, p

> 0,05). The correlation between the status of p53 (wildtype or mutated) and the sensitivity to Olaparib was not
statistically significant either (Mann Whitney U test, p >
0.05) (Supplementary Figure S1C). We also studied the
effects of Olaparib on the cell cycle profile using two ES
cell lines, A673 (1qN) and A4573 (1qG) (Figure 2B). Both
cell lines showed G2/M accumulation after treatment,
even at low doses of Olaparib (Figure 2B).

two cell lines (Table 1). We then studied the effects of
this drug combination on apoptosis induction via caspase
-3 and -7 activation after 48 hours of drug exposure as
well as cell cycle effects after 24 hours of treatment in
two cell lines, RM82 and TC71. We observed that the
drug combination (250pM of Trabectedin and 5μM of
Olaparib) increased the apoptotic rate in the TC71 cell line
(Supplementary Figure S2A). In agreement with this, we
observed cleaved PARP accumulation after treatment with
the combination, especially at 24 hours, in the TC71 cell
line (Supplementary Figure S2B). Furthermore a G2/M
accumulation and the elimination of the G0/G1 phase were
also observed after treatment with the drug combination
(Supplementary Figure S2C). In the RM82 cell line,
treatment with the drug combination only induced mild
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S2A). By contrast, no
effects on cell migration after 72 hours of drug exposure
were observed (Supplementary Figure S3).

The combination of olaparib and trabectedin is
highly synergistic in ES cell lines
Having observed that Olaparib was much more
cytotoxic than the other PARPinh, we studied the effects
of the combination of Olaparib with Trabectedin. ES cell
lines (n = 10) were exposed to different combinations
of both agents at a constant ratio of 1:20.000
(Trabectedin:Olaparib) for 72 hours and Combination
Indices (CIs) were determined according to [15, 16].
Interestingly, synergistic effects were observed in all but

cell line was used as a positive control. C. Western blotting showed that ES cell lines express PARP1 under normal conditions. Here, breast

The combination of olaparib and trabectedin
enhances DNA damage while EWSR1-FLI1
activity is not deregulated

even at the lowest drug concentrations used (125pM of
Trabectedin and 2.5 μM) (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the
combination did not affect EWSR1-FLI1 transcriptional
activity (Supplementary Figure S5A).
Moreover, DNA fragmentation assays revealed that
both drugs were able to generate enough damage to induce
DNA fragmentation (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure
S5B).

DNA damage induction was evaluated by testing
for the presence of intranuclear foci of γH2AX and
53BP1 after short (8 hours) and long (24 hours) drug
exposures. Initially, cells were treated with Trabectedin
(250pM) and/or Olaparib (5μM) for 8 hours. Trabectedin
induced a stronger DSB accumulation than that
induced by Olaparib alone (Student´s t-test, p < 0.05).
Nevertheless, the combination of both agents resulted
in a clear enhancement of DSB formation (Figure 3A
and Supplementary Figure S4). After 24 hours of drug
exposure, the drug combinations resulted in cumulative
effects of DNA damage through the induction of DSB,

with BRIP1, RFC1, PARP3, XRCC, POLD3 and PARP3
(Supplementary Tables S2, S3 and Supplementary Figure

repair machinery was clearly observed with the combined
treatment, where the HR genes RAD54L, EXO1, PARP2,

were overexpressed (Supplementary Table S2, S3 and

The drug combination increases DNA damage
induction and DDR activation in the in vivo model

at the end of the study (18 days after the treatments had
started), shown in Figure 5A and 5B respectively, were
evaluated in all groups. Although Trabectedin and Olaparib
alone were able to reduce tumor volume as compared with
the control groups, these differences were not statistically
significant (Mann-Whitney U-test, p > 0.05). However,
the combination of both drugs dramatically reduced
tumor growth (Mann-Whitney U-test p < 0.05). In fact,
the tumors were smaller at the end of the study than they
were at the moment of randomization, before treatment.
Histopathological analysis of representative
tumors from each group of mice revealed significant
morphological changes. The drug-induced morphological
changes were characterized by the presence of ES cells
with conspicuous nucleoli, granular chromatin, an
enlarged cytoplasm and vacuoles (Figure 5C). Necrosis
was observed in the animals of all groups, although it
was significantly more extensive in the animals treated
with the combination of drugs (t-test, p < 0.05) (Figure
5C and Supplementary Figure S8A). The necrotic/
viable tumor ratio was much higher in the treated groups
(Supplementary Figure S8A, B). No signs of toxicity were
observed with the combination treatment.

A representative number of tumor areas from
tumors of all groups in the in vivo study were evaluated
by Immunoflorescence (IF)/ Immunohistochemstry
(IHC) in order to assess the effects of the treatments. To
quantify the findings, we used the Ariol Image analysis
system (Olympus). The following parameters were
studied: apoptosis (fragmentation-late apoptosis and PARP
cleavage) (TUNEL assay and cleaved PARP); proliferation
(Ki67), DNA damage induction (γH2AX) and DDR
activation (BRCA2).
The proliferation index was higher in the controls
as compared with all treated groups, and this was
statistically significant (p < 0.05) (Figure 6, central panel
A and Supplementary Figure S8B). These results are in
agreement with the data from the TUNEL assays, where
late apoptosis due to DNA fragmentation was mostly
observed in representative tumor areas from animals
treated with Trabectedin alone or in tumors from animals
treated with the combination of drugs (Figure 6, upper

the Olaparib group (Figure 6, lower panel A).
Interestingly, DNA damage induction as assessed by
pH2AX staining was much higher in animals from both
combination groups (mean Combination 1: 60.975%,
mean Combination 2 group: 68.09%) as compared with
controls (mean 0.85%); Trabectedin (mean 11.13%)
and Olaparib (mean 1.04%) (p < 0.05) (Figure 6B and
Supplementary Figure S8C, S9). This observation
correlated well with the overexpression of the HR effector
molecule, BRCA2. Treatment with the combination of
Olaparib and Trabectedin resulted in a much more intense
and diffuse staining of BRCA2, especially in combination
2 (Combination1: mean 42.03%; Combination 2: mean
76.79% vs. mean control group 11.9%) (Supplementary
Figure S8D). Additionally, BRCA2 expression was diffuse
and intense in the case of tumors from the Trabectedin
group (mean 63.84%) (Figure 5C and Supplementary
Figure S8D, S10).

Because studies in PDX models are likely to be
more predictive of patient response to treatment than
conventional cell lines [17], we performed survival
studies in two ES PDX models (HSJD-ES-004 and HSJDES-006) established from patient biopsies at the Sant Joan
de Déu Hospital (HSJD, Barcelona, Spain). The clinical
characteristics of the patients and the molecular details
of both tumor models are shown in Table 2. The tumor
response at the end of treatment is shown in Table 3. The
most remarkable finding was that the Olaparib-Trabectedin
combination achieved complete response (CR) in 100%
of the tumors of both PDX models. In contrast, Olaparib
treatment alone led to progressive disease (PD) in 100% of
the tumors. Trabectedin alone achieved CR in 88% of the
HSJD-ES-004 tumors and CR in 78% of the HSJD-ES-006
tumors. CRs in monotherapy were transient in most
animals and did not persist until the end of the survival
study (Figure 7A). In the HSJD-ES-004 model, the median
survival of the controls was 14 days, as compared to 35

[7, 10]. Furthermore, PARP1, the main PARPinh target,
also acts as a transcriptional regulator of EWSR1-FLI1
[6]. Accordingly, we formulated the hypothesis that
the combination of Trabectedin with a PARPinh could
interfere with the DDR system and might be able to
inhibit EWSR1-FLI1, and could therefore be of interest as
a therapeutic strategy. The results obtained in the present
study support the clinical development of a combination
of PARPinh with Trabectedin in ES.
The relationship between PARP1 and ES has been
documented for many years [18]. However, knowledge of
the more specific and relevant role of this protein in ES
is much more recent [6, 7]. Brenner et al. described that
PARP1 interacts physically with EWSR1-FLI1 fusion,
acting in a positive feed-back loop and hence regulating
its own expression [6]. In a retrospective study, our group

days for the Olaparib group (p = 0.192), and 75 days for
the Trabectedin group (p = 0.0 01). In the HSJD-ES-006
model, the median survival of the controls was 11 days,
as compared to 17 days for the Olaparib group (p < 0.05),
and 35 days for the Trabectedin group (p = 0.001). The
combination therapy extended survival significantly, up to
a value greater than the evaluation period (80 days), when
compared with the control mice (p < 0.05 for both models;
Figure 7B).

DISCUSSION
Trabectedin induces DNA damage and cellular
death in vitro and interrupts EWSR1-FLI1-dependent
transcription [12]. Additionally, ES cells are sensitive to
PARPinh, which disrupt the DDR system of tumor cells

has reported that 1qG was of prognostic significance in ES
[4] and in the present study we show that 1qG is strongly
linked to the upregulation of PARP1, among other genes
[4].
The mechanism of action of PARPinh in cancer
cells appears to be mainly related to the induction of
DNA damage by the formation of irreparable SSB.
These drugs are used in monotherapy in tumors with
baseline molecular inactivation in some of the DDR
system components, such as BRCA1/BRCA2 [19, 20].
The use of PARPinh in monotherapy to treat patients
with breast cancer defective in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 is
a clear example of what is known as synthetic lethality
[19, 20]. So far, there is no evidence of BRCA1/BRCA2
mutations in ES [21]. However, the use of PARPinh has
been expanded to tumors harboring ETS translocations,

such as prostate cancer and ES [5, 6]. In ES in particular,
sensitivity to PARPinh seems to be related to EWSR1FLI1 transcriptional activity [6, 7].
Olaparib is the drug chosen in most studies
addressing ES [6, 7, 22]. In the present study, we decided
to test the efficacy of three different PARPinh, all of
them extensively studied in solid tumors. Olaparib and
Veliparib have a similar mechanism of action in that they
compete with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
to bind the catalytically active site of the PARP enzyme.
By contrast, Iniparib (BSI-201) does not compete with the
active site of the PARP enzyme but induces an irreversible
modification of PARP1 and stimulates a PARP1-protease
[23]. Although Iniparib was tested in a phase III study
in triple-negative breast cancer patients, its efficacy and
specificity have recently been questioned [24]. According

Figure 6: Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor xenografts: Apoptosis, proliferation and
DNA damage induction. A. The images show a higher number of Ki67 positive cells in the control group as compared to tumors treated

with Trabectedin alone or with the combinations of Olaparib and Trabectedin (central panel). In the TUNEL assay, cell staining was mostly
observed in tumors from the Trabectedin group and from the combination groups (upper panel). PARP cleavage only revealed a slight
staining in the Olaparib group. B. The images show intranuclear γH2AX staining in tumors from all the groups but it is more extensive and
intense mainly in non-necrotic areas of the tumors from the Olaparib and Trabectedin combinations. C. The images show an intense, focal
BRCA2 staining in tumors from the Trabectedin and the combination groups. Very little expression was observed in the Olaparib group.
Combination1 refers to 100mg/kg Olaparib and 0.15mg/kg Trabectedin, which started to be administered after day 7. Combination2 refers
to Olaparib and 0.15mg/kg.Trabectedin.

to the results of our study, Iniparib is by far the least
active of the three PARPinh tested. By contrast, Olaparib
was the most active compound tested against ES cell
lines, with an IC50 for proliferation ranging from the high
nanomolar to the low micromolar range, very similar to
the data published by other groups [7]. Interestingly, and
in contrast to previous work [7], Olaparib was seen to
be not only a potent cytotoxic agent after 3 days of drug
exposure, but its action lasted for at least 6 days, when the
IC50 underwent a significant decrease in all the cell lines
assayed. However, in the in vivo study, Olaparib alone
was only partially effective in terms of tumor shrinkage.
This is also in accordance with previous studies, in which
Olaparib was not able to halt tumor growth [6]. In fact, a
recent clinical trial of Olaparib alone in relapsed/refractory
ES patients was withdrawn due to the lack of objective
responses (Revised in [1]).
Since PARPinh are not only used in monotherapy
but also in combination with radiotherapy and other
chemotherapeutic agents that cause DNA damage,

we decided to combine Olaparib with Trabectedin.
Interestingly, the groups of Grohar and Burdach have
recently suggested combining Trabectedin with drugs that
further increase DNA damage and diminish EWSR1-FLI1
transcriptional activity. According to the hypothesis of
Grohar and Burdach, the repression of the downstream
targets of an oncogene increases cancer cell sensitivity;
such repression can be specifically addressed by combined
precision chemotherapy, increasing the therapeutic index
of the combined agents and overcoming resistance to
highly selective targeted therapies [14, 25]. Grohar et al.
demonstrated that the combination of Trabectedin and
Irinotecan in ES exhibits synergistic activity, confirming
the molecular precision treatment concept [14, 25].
This concept could also be applied to the combination
of PARPinh and Trabectedin. In fact, PARPinh, and in
particular Olaparib, are involved in DNA damage, and
the knockdown of PARP1 in ES cell lines disrupts the
expression of known EWSR1-FLI1 target genes [6].
Grohar et al. found a decreased expression of known

MATERIALs AND METHODS

EWSR1-FLI1 up-regulated target genes, such as NR0B1,
and very little expression of down-regulated target genes
after treatment with Trabectedin at 10nM for 12 hours in
TC71 and TC32 ES cells [12]. Our results showed that
the combination of Trabectedin and Olaparib was highly
synergistic, increasing apoptotic activity and arresting the
cell cycle at the G2/M phases for ES, but that it did not
deregulate EWSR1-FLI1 target expression in the TC71
cell line. This antitumor activity was also observed in
vivo, where the drug combination reduced tumor growth
dramatically, even when Trabectedin was administered one
week later than Olaparib. Furthermore, we observed that
although both agents alone induced DNA damage through
an accumulation of γH2AX foci and deregulation of the
DDR pathways in vitro, the combination significantly
increased this phenomenon. This drug combination
actively deregulated the major DDR pathways, without
changing EWSR1-FLI1 target expression. The effects of
the drug combination in vivo confirmed the in vitro data,
the accumulation of γH2AX foci increasing with the
overexpression of BRCA2. Most importantly, a complete
and maintained regression of tumors for 80 days due to the
combination therapy was observed in ES PDX models. To
our knowledge, this is the first time PDX mouse models
have been reported in ES. These models are renewable
tumor models engrafted in mice from fresh human ES
samples without prior in vitro growth. PDX models have
been shown to be biologically stable and to accurately
reflect patient tumor biology and treatment response
in other tumor types [26, 27]. Thus, the results of our
study could be considered sufficient to justify the design
of a clinical trial using the combination of Olaparib and
Trabectedin in ES. Other studies have combined Olaparib
with drugs/strategies inducing DNA damage, namely
Temozolomide and radiotherapy [6, 22]. In both cases
the combination regimen showed a reduction in tumor
volume in comparison with the controls. However, DNA
damage induction and the DDR activation machinery were
not studied in depth. Here, we observed not only that the
combination is active both in vitro and in vivo but also
that it induces a deregulation of the DDR pathways. A
recent study has shown that ES cell lines are defective in
DDR and when the PARPinh BMN-673 was combined
with Irinotecan and Temozolomide, 88% of complete
responses were achieved in an orthotopic model of ES
[10]. In our study, complete responses were achieved with
the combination of Olaparib and Trabectedin in 100% of
mice from two ES PDX models studied.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge this
is the first time that the combination of a PARPinh and
Trabectedin has been reported in ES. The combination
could be a useful therapeutic strategy in ES that should be
further explored.

Cell culture
Ten ES cell lines (RDES, WE68, STAET-2.1, RM82,
TC71, SK-N-MC, CADO, A673, A4573, STAET-1) and
the SJRH Rhabdomyosarcoma cell line were grown in
RPMI supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
and 1% antibiotic (P/S), except that A673 ES cell line was
grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco,
Invitrogen). All ES cell lines were obtained from the FP6funded Eurobonet consortium cell line panel, which is
maintained and regularly checked and characterized [4].
All ES cell lines and SJRH were grown on gelatin-coated
plates in an incubator at 37ºC and 5% CO2. MCF7 and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were cultured in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic (P/S) (Gibco, Invitrogen)
and 1% glutamine (Gibco, Invitrogen). All cells were free
of mycoplasma, as screened at least once a month with the
MycoAlert® Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).

Drugs
The following PARPinh were used: Olaparib (LC
Laboratories), Veliparib (AxonMEDCHEM), Iniparib (LC
Laboratories). All drugs were prepared at the appropriate
stocking concentration in DMSO (Sigma) and stored at
-20ºC until use. Trabectedin was kindly provided by
PharmaMar (Madrid, Spain).

Proliferation assays
Briefly, cells were counted by Trypan blue and
seeded 24 hour prior to treatment in complete medium on
24-well culture plates or 96-well culture plates. Treatments
were added later and cells were incubated for 72 hours.
The medium was then removed and cells were incubated
for 1h with a 1:10 MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The
medium was later removed and replaced by 500µl of
DMSO (Merck). Absorbance was then read on an Infinite®
F500 Tecan plate reader (Tecan) at 570nm. The number of
cells seeded for each assay depended on the type of cell
line and its growth rate. To define drug-drug interactions
(in terms of synergism, additivity, or antagonism), the CI
was calculated according to the Chou-Talalay method
[15, 16], using CalcuSyn software Version 2.0 (Biosoft).
Synergy levels can be broadly divided into: < 0.1 very
strong synergism; 0.1-0.90, synergism (ranging from
strong synergism to slight synergism), and 0.90-1.10,
nearly additive to additive.

Detection of caspase 3 and 7 activities

levels was accomplished using Image J software (National
Institutes of Health).

The activity of caspases 3 and 7 was determined in
a Caspase Glo (Promega) luminescence assay. Initially,
cells were seeded in white-walled 96-well plates for 24
hours and then treated with the drug for 24 hours. After
incubation with the drug, 100µl of a mixture of caspase
Glo buffer and substrate, prepared at the time at RT, was
added per well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour and
luminescence was read on an Infinite® F500 Tecan plate
reader (Tecan). Caspase 3 and 7 activity was calculated
by subtracting the blank value (well with medium but no
cells) and was normalized to the controls (untreated cells).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded on slide covers placed (one slide
cover per well) on 96-well plates pretreated with 1%
gelatin/ MilliQ H2O (Sigma) for 24 hours in complete
medium. The medium was removed and the cells were
incubated in medium with drug/DMSO (Sigma) for 6
hours (short exposure) or 24 hours (long exposure). After
treatment, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol (Sigma)
for 15 minutes, washed twice, permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 30 minutes, and blocked in PBS with
2% BSA (Sigma) for another 30 minutes. The pH2AX
primary antibody (Cell Signaling) was then incubated
overnight, and after several washes the Cy3 secondary
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was incubated for
1 hour. After 15 minutes of washes, the primary anti53BP1 antibody (Abcam) was incubated for 3 hours at
RT followed by several washes, and the Cy5 secondary
antibody was incubated for 1 hour at RT. After several
washes, DAPI at 1mg/ml in PBS was used to stain
nuclei, applying it for 15 minutes. Finally, slide covers
were mounted using Mowiol (Sigma) and were observed
under a Leica microscope using Leica software. pH2AX
fluorescence was quantified using Image J software, where
at least 50 nuclei were analyzed using the following
formula: Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) =
Integrated Density (IT)- (Area of selected cell- Mean of
fluorescence of background readings). The number of
intracellular foci of pH2AX was measured by counting
independent intranuclear foci of at least 50 nuclei.

PARP1 probe design and FISH
Two specific and independent PARP1 locus probes
(BAC Clones RPII-964L17 and RPII-831N20) labeled
with Spectrum green-dUTP (green signal) (Vysis) were
made. Probes were labeled as previously described
[28, 29]. Briefly, isolated BAC DNA was labeled with
Spectrum red-dUTP (Vysis) by nick translation (Vysis)
and purified after adding 10μg of COT-1. A commercially
available (CEP 1) probe (Vysis) labeled with spectrum
red (red signal) was also used. To check the specificity
of the home-made probes, co-hybridizations using both
commercial CEP1 and PARP1 specific probes were
performed on peripheral blood cells in metaphase. FISH
analysis was performed on cell lines fixed in methanolacetic acid. A volume of 10μl of the diluted probes
was applied to the slides. The slide was covered with a
glass coverslip and sealed with rubber cement. Using a
Hybrite machine (Vysis), denaturation was performed
at 75°C for 5 minutes and hybridization was carried
out at 37°C for at least 16 hours. After removing the
coverslips, post-hybridization washes were done at 46ºC
in 2XSSC, 50% formamide, for 5 minutes and stained
with DAPI (6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and mounted
with Vectashield H-1000 medium (Vector). Digital images
were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan2 epi-fluorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a digital camera
(ORCA-ER-1394, Hamamatsu Photonics KK). In all
cases, one hundred nuclei were counted [28, 30].

Real time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from all cell lines studied
using a Qiagen mini kit (Qiagen). Following Qiagen’s
instructions, 2μg of high quality RNA was reversetranscribed (Qiagen). Primers for the PARP1 gene were
designed using primer 3 software (MIT, Cambridge,
MA, USA), and quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (qRT-PCR) was performed as described earlier
using SYBR Green [32]. qRT-PCR was performed
under universal cycling conditions on an ABI 7300HT
instrument (Applied Biosystems), using commercially
available TaqMan probes: PARP1 (HS00242302-m1);
NR0B1 (HS03043658-m1); NKX2-2 (HS00159616-m1);
TGFβR2 (HS00234253-m1); CAV1 (HS00971716_m1)
and Mastermix (all from Life Technologies). Cycle
threshold (CT) values were normalized to Beta Actin
(ACTB). Experiments were performed at least twice and
in triplicate. The relative expression level was calculated
as described previously [33].

Protein extraction and western blotting
Protein extraction and western blotting were done as
previously described [31, 32]. Briefly, primary antibodies
were used: pH2Ax (Cell Signaling); PARP (Cell
signaling), Calnexin (Santa-Cruz) and Actin (Sigma) were
incubated overnight at 4ºC in TBS-T 0.5% BSA (Sigma).
Secondary anti-Rb-Cy3 and anti-Ms-Cy5 antibodies were
incubated for 1 hour at RT and the images were recovered
using Odissey software. The quantification of protein

sterile water, vehicle of Trabectedin and/or 2-hydroxylpropyl-B cyclodextrin 10% in PBS plus 10% DMSO
(Sigma-Aldrich), vehicle of Olaparib. Mice with tumor
volumes greater than 1.5 cm3 were excluded from the
analysis. Tumors were measured every 2-3 days with a
caliper and diameters were recorded. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the formula: a2b/2, where a and b are the 2
maximum diameters. Mice were sacrificed by anaesthetic
overdosing 4 weeks after cell injection, and tumors, liver
and kidneys were collected for histopathological analyses.
All experimental manipulations with mice were performed
under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.

RNA was extracted from the TC71 cell line,
using a Qiagen mini kit (Qiagen). Following Qiagen’s
instructions, 0.5μg of high-quality RNA were reversetranscribed and hybridized on a Human DNA Repair
PCR Array (Qiagen). The following protocol was set
in an iQ5 BioRad thermo cycler (Bio-Rad): 10 minutes
cycle at 95ºC for Taq Polymerase activation, followed by
40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95ºC and 1 minute at 60ºC to
perform fluorescence data acquisition. Data were analyzed
using the online software http://www.sabiosciences.
com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php. Pathway analysis was
performed using IPA (Ingenuity systems), as previously
described [32].

In vivo preclinical testing in ES PDX models
NOD/SCID mice (Harlan, Barcelona, Spain) were
used for initial engraftment and further passages were
performed in athymic nude mice (Harlan). For the survival
studies, nude mice bearing subcutaneous 200-500 mm3
tumors in both flanks were randomized into 4 groups of
5 mice. One group received 100 mg/kg Olaparib twice
daily (5 days on, 2 off) IP for 2 weeks; a second group
was treated with 0.15 mg/kg Trabectedin (the MTD) IV
on days 1 and 8; a third group received the combination of
Olaparib and Trabectedin under the same regimens; and a
fourth group acted as controls. Mice were sacrificed when
the tumor diameter reached 1.5 cm3 and the study was
finalized at day 80 post-treatment.
To study the activity of the different regimens, we
evaluated tumor response at the end of treatment (day 21)
and animal survival until the end of the study (day 80).
Tumor response was evaluated as described elsewhere
[34]. Animal survival was defined as the time interval
between the initial date of treatment and the date on which
the threshold 1.5 cm3 tumor volume was reached.

Cell cycle
Propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to analyze
cell cycle changes by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting
(FACS). Cells were seeded in 6 well-plates and incubated
with the appropriate drug for 24 hours. PI staining was
performed as described elsewhere [31, 32]. Cells were
acquired (20,000 events) with a FACSort Cytometer
(Becton Dickinson). Analysis of the results was performed
using Infinicyt (Cytognos), Paint-a-Gate (Becton
Dickinson) and ModFit software (Verity Software House).

Migration assays
These assays were performed by wound healing,
where 5 x104 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and when
confluence reached 90%, a wound was performed with a
pipette tip from one side to the other. Medium with drug
was added and incubated for 8/24/48 and/or 72 hours.
After drug exposure, cells were washed, stained with 1%
crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 2% ethanol (SigmaAldrich), and observed with a Leica Microscope (Leica
Microsystems), where pictures were obtained.

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Excised tumors, kidney and livers were sampled just
after sacrifice and representative areas were a) formalinfixed (24 hours) (Millipore) and paraffin-embedded and
(b) snap-frozen in OCT and stored at 80ºC as previously
described [32]. Tissue sections 2μM thick were stained
with hematoxilin & eosin and prepared for IHC. Two
experienced pathologists (MCGM and EDA) observed the
samples under a Leica microscope (Leica Microsystems).
IHC was performed as previously described [32] using the
following primary antibodies: anti-pH2AX (Millipore);
anti-cleaved PARP (cell signaling); anti-Ki67 (Millipore)
and anti-BRCA2 (Millipore). TUNEL assays (Roche)
were performed to detect DNA fragmentation and late
apoptosis. To quantify the extent of necrosis and the IHC
findings, the Dotslide analysis program (Olympus) and
the Ariol Image analysis system (Olympus) were used
respectively.

In vivo study
4-5 week-old female NOD/scid mice were used.
Induction of tumour xenografts was performed by
subcutaneous injection of cell suspensions, containing
5x106 of TC71 live cells in 0.2 ml of 1:1 cellular medium/
Matrigel matrix (Becton Dickinson) into the right flank of
the mice. This study followed the Spanish and European
Union guidelines for animal experimentation (RD
1201/05, RD 53/2013 and 86/609/CEE, respectively).
Mice were randomized into control and treatment groups
(n = 10) one week after the tumor started to be measurable
(10 days after injection: day 0 of treatment). Drugs were
administered in the following vehicles: 0.9% NaCl in
