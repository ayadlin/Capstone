ABSTRACT
Smac mimetics antagonize IAP proteins, which are highly expressed in several
cancers. Recent reports indicate that Smac mimetics trigger a broad cytokine response
and synergize with immune modulators to induce cell death. Here, we identify a
differential requirement of TRAIL or TNFα as mediators of IFNα/Smac mimeticinduced cell death depending on the cellular context. Subtoxic concentrations of
Smac mimetics cooperate with IFNα to induce cell death in various solid tumor cell
lines in a highly synergistic manner as determined by combination index. Mechanistic
studies show that IFNα/BV6 cotreatment promotes the formation of a caspase-8activating complex together with the adaptor protein FADD and RIP1. Assembly of
this RIP1/FADD/caspase-8 complex represents a critical event, since RIP1 silencing
inhibits IFNα/BV6-induced cell death. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of
paracrine/autocrine TNFα signaling by the TNFα scavenger Enbrel rescues HT-29 colon
carcinoma cells, but not A172 glioblastoma cells from IFNα/BV6-induced cell death.
By comparison, A172 cells are significantly protected against IFNα/BV6 treatment by
blockage of TRAIL signaling through genetic silencing of TRAIL or its cognate receptor
TRAIL receptor 2 (DR5). Despite this differential requirement of TNFα and TRAIL
signaling, mRNA and protein expression is increased by IFNα/BV6 cotreatment in
both cell lines. Interestingly, A172 cells turn out to be resistant to exogenously added
recombinant TNFα even in the presence of BV6, whereas they display a high sensitivity
towards TRAIL/BV6. In contrast, BV6 efficiently sensitizes HT-29 cells to TNFα while
TRAIL only had limited efficacy. This demonstrates that a differential sensitivity
towards TRAIL or TNFα determines the dependency on either death receptor ligand
for IFNα/Smac mimetic-induced cell death. Thus, by concomitant stimulation of both
death receptor systems IFNα/Smac mimetic combination treatment is an effective
strategy to induce cell death in TNFα- or TRAIL-responsive cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Small-molecule inhibitors of IAP proteins including
Smac mimetics have been designed as anticancer
therapeutics to engage programmed cell death in cancer
cells [1]. Smac mimetics cause autoubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of IAP proteins that harbor
a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain, in
particular cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis protein (cIAP)
proteins, which leads to NF-κB activation, upregulation
of NF-κB target genes such as tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)α and TNFα-mediated cell death in the presence
of Smac mimetics [2-4]. Also, Smac mimetic-induced

Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) proteins are highly
expressed in a variety of human cancers and block
programmed cell death by inhibiting caspase activation
and by modulating nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκB) signaling via ubiquitination events [1]. Second
mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) is a
mitochondrial intermembrane space protein that promotes
apoptosis upon its release into the cytosol by binding to
and antagonizing IAP proteins [1].

IAP depletion promotes the formation of two alternative
cytosolic cell death complexes referred to as complexes IIa
and IIb. Complex IIa is composed of receptor-interacting
protein (RIP) 1, FAS-associated death domain protein
(FADD) and caspase-8, leading to activation of caspases
and apoptosis [5]. When caspase-8 activity is inhibited,
RIP1 interacts with RIP3 to form complex IIb and to
initiate necroptosis [5]. Thereby, Smac mimetic-stimulated
IAP depletion can engage apoptosis as well as necroptosis.
Since the antitumor activity of Smac mimetic
monotherapy proved to be limited in the majority of
preclinical cancer models, there has been a continued
interest to design rational combinations. To this end,
dual immunotherapy approaches using Smac mimetics
together with immunostimulatory cytokines may offer
a promising option. The type I interferon (IFN)α is
an immunostimulatory agent that has been shown to
exhibit anticancer activity in solid tumors as well as in
hematological malignancies [6]. For clinical application,
modified IFN products such as pegylated IFNα2 with
extended in vivo half-lives that constantly increase
IFNα levels over prolonged periods of times have
been developed [6, 7]. IFNα is considered to exert its
anticancer effects both directly via its effects on cancer
cells and indirectly via activation of immune cells [8].
Binding of IFNα to the IFNα receptor on the plasma
membrane of cancer cells engages signal transduction
pathways that lead to inhibition of cell proliferation and/
or induction of apoptosis [8]. We recently found that
the small-molecule Smac mimetic BV6 together with
recombinant IFNα synergistically induces apoptosis in
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells without increased
toxicity against normal peripheral blood lymphocytes [9].
In the present study, we investigated the anticancer activity
of this combinatory approach beyond AML in a variety
of solid tumors and explored the underlying molecular
mechanisms of action.

cells for subsequent studies. Dose-response studies showed
that IFNα and BV6 triggered apoptosis and reduced
cell viability in a synergistic manner as determined by
calculation of combination index (CI) (Suppl. Fig.1;
Suppl.Table 1). Synergistic tumoricidal activity of IFNα
and BV6 was confirmed using propidium iodide (PI)
staining to determine plasma membrane permeabilization
as another cell death assay (Figure 1B). To test the general
relevance of our findings we extended these experiments
to other Smac mimetics. Similarly, monovalent (LCL161,
CUDC427) and bivalent (Birinapant) Smac mimetics
acted in concert with IFNα to reduce cell viability (Suppl.
Figure 2). Together, these data demonstrate that IFNα
and Smac mimetics cooperate to induce cell death across
different cancer entities.
To determine whether caspase activity is
required for IFNα/BV6-induced cell death, we used
the pharmacological pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk.
Addition of zVAD.fmk significantly decreased IFNα/BV6induced DNA fragmentation and increased cell viability in
A172 cells (Figure 1C, 1D; left panels). In contrast, IFNα/
BV6 in combination with zVAD.fmk even significantly
reduced cell viability in HT-29 cells when compared
to IFNα/BV6 treatment alone, while we observed no
significant increase in DNA fragmentation (Figure 1C,
1D; right panels). These results indicate that A172 cells
undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis in response to IFNα/
BV6 cotreatment, while HT-29 cells can die via a caspaseindependent, non-apoptotic mechanism upon caspase
inhibition that is not associated with typical apoptotic
markers such as DNA fragmentation.
Therefore, we next investigated whether IFNα/
BV6 cotreatment induces necroptosis as an alternative
mode of cell death in caspase-inhibited HT-29 cells. To
this end, we tested the effects of the RIP1 kinase inhibitor
Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) in the presence and absence of
zVAD.fmk. Addition of Nec-1 significantly rescued
caspase-inhibited HT-29 cells from IFNα/BV6-mediated
loss of cell viability and cell death, while Nec-1 exerted
no significant effects on IFNα/BV6-induced loss of cell
viability and cell death in HT-29 cells without caspase
inhibition (Figure 1C, 1D; right panels) or in A172 cells in
the presence or absence of zVAD.fmk (Figure 1C, 1D; left
panels). This indicates that IFNα/BV6 cotreatment induces
caspase-dependent apoptosis in A172 cells, while HT-29
cells undergo RIP1-dependent necroptosis when caspase
activity is impaired.

RESULTS
IFNα and BV6 synergistically induce cell death in
various cancer cell lines
Initially, we evaluated the dual immunotherapy
approach employing Smac mimetics and recombinant
IFNα in a panel of solid cancer cell lines. IFNα and BV6
cooperated to induce apoptosis (determined by DNA
fragmentation as a typical marker of apoptotic cell death)
and to reduce cell viability (measured by MTT assay) in
several cell lines from different cancer entities including
HT-29 colon carcinoma, A172 and T98G glioblastoma,
BxPC-3 pancreatic carcinoma, RH30 rhabdomyosarcoma
and A4573 Ewing sarcoma cells (Figure 1A). We then
selected A172 glioblastoma and HT-29 colon carcinoma

IFNα/BV6 cotreatment triggers IAP depletion,
complex II formation and caspase activation
Since depletion of IAP proteins is a hallmark of
Smac mimetic-induced cell death [2], we next assessed
expression levels of cIAP1, cIAP2 and x-linked Inhibitor
of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP). Treatment with BV6 alone
and in combination with IFN caused rapid downregulation

of cIAP1 and cIAP2 already after 3 hours (Figure 2A) and
a slight reduction of XIAP protein levels after 12 to 18
hours (Suppl. Figure 3). At 6 hours we noted re-expression
of cIAP2 in A172 cells, which was initially degraded at
3 hours (Figure 2A). This rebound of cIAP2 expression
upon prolonged exposure to Smac mimetic has previously

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been linked to Smac mimetic-stimulated activation of NFκB [10] and the requirement of cIAP1 for Smac mimetictriggered degradation of cIAP2.
Since depletion of cIAP proteins favors formation
of a cytosolic complex composed of RIP1, FADD and
caspase-8, we immunoprecipitated caspase-8 and analyzed

induce cleavage of caspase-8 into p43/p41 fragments and
cleavage of caspase-3 into p19/p17/p12 fragments (Figure

IFNα/BV6-induced cell death depends on RIP1

BV6-stimulated formation of the RIP1/FADD/caspase-8
complex in HT-29 cells but not in A172 cells (Figure 4C).
These findings indicate a differential requirement of TNFα
for IFNα/BV6-induced cell death.

Since scaffolding functions of RIP1 in addition to
its kinase activity have been reported to be indispensable
for the induction of cell death [5], we genetically silenced
RIP1 using two independent siRNA sequences directed
against RIP1. Knockdown efficacy of RIP1 was confirmed
by Western blotting (Figure 3A). Of note, silencing of
RIP1 significantly protected A172 and HT-29 cells against
IFNα/BV6-induced DNA fragmentation as well as loss
of cell viability (Figure 3B, 3C). Also, RIP1 knockdown
reduced IFNα/BV6-mediated cleavage of caspase-8 and
-3 into active cleavage fragments (Figure 3D). This set of
experiments demonstrates that RIP1 is required for IFNα/
BV6-induced cell death.

IFNα and BV6 cooperate to increase TNFα and
TRAIL production
To investigate whether this differential requirement
of TNFα for IFNα/BV6-induced cell death is due to
differences in TNFα production, we determined TNFα
mRNA levels and secretion of TNF protein in response
to IFNα/BV6 cotreatment. Interestingly, cotreatment
with IFNα/BV6 significantly increased TNFα mRNA
expression as well as secretion of TNFα into the
supernatant in both A172 and HT-29 cells (Figure 5A,
5B). Since TNFα turned out to be dispensable for IFNα/
BV6-induced cell death in A172 cells, we also assessed
production of Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) as another death receptor ligand
besides TNFα in response to IFNα/BV6 cotreatment.
Treatment with IFNα alone and in combination with BV6
upregulated TRAIL mRNA levels in both HT-29 and
A172 cells (Figure 5C). Also, IFNα and BV6 cooperated
to enhance expression of TRAIL protein in both cell lines
(Figure 5D). Thus, combined IFNα/BV6 immunotherapy
stimulates production of TNFα and TRAIL in both A172
and HT-29 cells.

Differential requirement of TNFα for IFNα/BV6induced cell death
To test whether TNFα is involved in mediating cell
death upon IFNα/BV6 combinatorial therapy, we used the
TNFα-blocking antibody Enbrel. Indeed, administration of
Enbrel significantly decreased IFNα/BV6-induced DNA
fragmentation and loss of cell viability in HT-29 cells
(Figure 4A, 4B; right panels). In contrast, Enbrel failed to
rescue A172 cells from IFNα/BV6 cotreatment (Figure 4A,
4B; left panels). Consistently, Enbrel suppressed IFNα/

death in A172 cells.

Differential sensitivity to TRAIL and TNFα is
responsible for the differential requirement of
TRAIL and TNFα for IFNα/BV6-induced cell
death

To investigate whether TRAIL is required as a
mediator of IFNα/BV6-induced cell death in A172 cells,
which die in a TNFα-independent manner (Figure 4A-4C),
we silenced TRAIL by siRNA oligonucleotides (Figure
6A). Interestingly, knockdown of TRAIL significantly
reduced IFNα/BV6-induced cell death as well as loss
of cell viability in A172 cells (Figure 6B, 6C). We also
used an alternative strategy to block the TRAIL system by
silencing DR5, since DR4 is not expressed in A172 cells
[11]. Similarly, knockdown of DR5 significantly protected
A172 cells against IFNα/BV6-imposed cell death and loss
of cell viability (Figure 6D-6G).
Since we found that IFNα/BV6-stimulated assembly
of the RIP1/FADD/caspase-8 complex occurs in a TNFαindependent manner in A172 cells (Figure 4C), we then
explored whether signaling via TRAIL mediates formation
of this cell death complex upon IFNα/BV6 cotreatment.
Indeed, knockdown of either DR5 or TRAIL reduced
recruitment of RIP1, FADD and caspase-8 compared to
control cells (Figure 6H). Together, this set of experiments
shows that TRAIL is required for IFNα/BV6-induced
formation of the RIP1/FADD/caspase-8 complex and cell

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since A172 and HT-29 cells display a differential
requirement of TRAIL and TNFα signaling for IFNα/
BV6-induced cell death, although they produce
comparable amounts of TRAIL and TNFα upon IFNα/
BV6 cotreatment (Figure 5B, 5D) and express TNFR1
and DR5 (suppl. Figure 4), we hypothesized that A172
and HT-29 cells are differentially sensitive to these death
receptor ligands. To test this hypothesis we exogenously
added TNFα or TRAIL at increasing concentrations in
the presence and absence of BV6. Strikingly, A172 cells
were refractory to treatment with TNFα alone and in the
presence of BV6 (Figure 7A). In contrast, addition of BV6
rendered HT-29 cells sensitive to TNFα-induced loss of
cell viability even at low concentrations of TNFα (Figure
7A). TRAIL triggered loss of cell viability in A172 cells
in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HT-29 cells were
resistant even to the highest dose of TRAIL that was used

DISCUSSION

(Figure 7B, left panel). Addition of BV6 further enhanced
the TRAIL-induced loss of cell viability in A172 cells
(Figure 7B, right panel). While BV6 also enhanced the
sensitivity of HT-29 cells towards TRAIL, HT-29 cells
remained substantially less responsive towards BV6/
TRAIL compared to A172 cells (Figure 7B) with more
than 1 log difference in IC50 values (suppl. Figure 5;
IC50 A172 cells: 0.49 ng/ml TRAIL, IC50 A HT-29
cells: 9.54 ng/ml TRAIL). Together, these findings show
that A172 cells are sensitive to TRAIL but refractory to
TNFα, whereas HT-29 cells are susceptible to TNFα in the
presence of Smac mimetics.

In the present study, we show that dual
immunotherapy employing Smac mimetics and
recombinant IFNα represents a promising approach to
reactivate cell death in various solid cancers. IFNα and
Smac mimetics at suboptimal concentrations act together
to trigger cell death in a synergistic manner as confirmed
by calculation of CI.
The novelty of our study resides in particular
in the following two points. First, we demonstrate
that IFNα/Smac mimetic combination treatment is

an effective strategy to induce cell death in TNFα- or
TRAIL-responsive cancers by concomitant stimulation
of both death receptor systems. We identify a differential
requirement of TRAIL or TNFα as mediators of IFNα/
Smac mimetic-induced cell death depending on the
cellular context. We show that the sensitivity to TRAIL
and TNFα determines whether a cell line depends on
TRAIL or TNFα signaling to mediate IFNα/BV6-induced
cell death irrespective of increased production of these
death ligands in response to IFNα/BV6 combination
therapy. We characterize two prototypic models that
require either TRAIL or TNFα for IFNα/BV6-induced
cell death. In A172 glioblastoma cells, TRAIL turned
out to be the critical mediator of IFNα/BV6-induced cell
death, since genetic silencing of TRAIL or DR5 protects
cells from cell death upon IFNα/BV6 cotreatment. By
comparison, TNFα is a crucial mediator of IFNα/BV6induced cell death in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells, since
pharmacological blockage of TNFα rescues cell death
by IFNα/BV6. In both cell line models, the addition of
suboptimal concentrations of IFNα to subtoxic doses of
Smac mimetics results in the cooperative production of
TRAIL and TNFα. Interestingly, the cell’s sensitivity to
TRAIL or TNFα rather than the production of these death
receptor ligands determines the functional relevance of
TRAIL and TNFα signaling for IFNα/BV6-induced cell
death. Second, we demonstrate cooperative induction
of cell death by IFNα/BV6 cotreatment in several solid
cancers such as glioblastoma, colon and pancreatic
carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.
Together with our previous report showing synergistic
antileukemic activity of IFNα and BV6 in AML, a
hematological malignancy [9], our present study provides
evidence showing that this dual immunotherapy approach
is of general relevance across cancers.
Recently, there has been a renewed interest in
therapeutically exploiting type I interferons such as IFNα,
which is the first bio-therapeutic approved and that plays
a documented role as anticancer agent in solid cancers
as well as in hematological malignancies [6]. Modified
IFNα preparations that yield constant IFN levels over a
prolonged period of time exhibited substantial anticancer
activity in preclinical in vivo models as well as in a proofof-concept study in humans [12, 13].
Besides IFNs, innate immune stimuli including
oncolytic viruses and immunostimulatory adjuvants have
been used in combination with Smac mimetics for cancer
immunotherapy. Recently, oncolytic virus infection or
treatment with non-infectious adjuvants such as poly(I:C)
and CpG oligonucleotides have been reported to engage
bystander cancer cell death upon concomitant treatment
with Smac mimetics via stimulation of a cytokine storm
[14]. Furthermore, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)based immunotherapy has been described to act in concert
with Smac mimetics to suppress tumor growth of bladder
cancer [15]. These reports underline the therapeutic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

potential of Smac mimetic-based combinations with
immune stimuli for cancer immunotherapy.
Our study has important implications for the
development of dual cancer immunotherapy with Smac
mimetics. First, by demonstrating a synergistic interaction
of IFNα/Smac mimetic combination therapy in a variety
of solid cancers, our findings imply that this approach is
generally relevant to maximize the anticancer activity of
Smac mimetics. Second, IFNα/Smac mimetic cotreatment
could offer a treatment option that may be safer than
Smac mimetic monotherapy, since it relies on autocrine/
paracrine TNFα production or TRAIL signaling. Since
TNFα not only mediates Smac mimetic-induced cell death
but may also cause dose-limiting, on-target side effects
such as cytokine release syndrome [16], TNFα production
represents a double-edged sword. Due to synergistic drug
interactions, IFNα/Smac mimetic combination therapy
allows to use lower doses of each individual agent, which
might reduce the risk of dose-dependent toxic side effects.
In addition, IFNα/Smac mimetic combination may alter
the spectrum of treatment-induced cytokine generation
and could shift the production towards TRAIL, a wellestablished IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) downstream of
type I IFN signaling [17, 18]. Also, we recently identified
Smac mimetic-stimulated, NF-κB-dependent upregulation
of DR5 as a critical mediator of Smac mimetic-induced
apoptosis, for example in A172 cells [19]. Thus,
dual immunotherapy using Smac mimetics and IFNα
may provide a mean to engage the TRAIL signaling
pathway to cell death endogenously in cancer cells. Of
note, combinations of Smac mimetics together with the
administration of exogenous TRAIL receptor agonists
were shown in a variety of preclinical cancer models to
efficiently suppress tumor growth [20]. Currently, the
Smac mimetic Birinapant and the TRAIL-R2 agonist
Conatumumab are under clinical evaluation [21]. Since
in clinical trials TRAIL receptor agonists proved to be
well-tolerated in humans [22], Smac mimetic-based
combination regimens that embark on TRAIL signaling
to mediate cell death may offer a favorable safety profile.
Third, our findings are relevant for the development
of suitable biomarkers for clinical trials with Smac
mimetics. Upregulation of circulating cytokines such as
TNFα in the blood of patients receiving Smac mimetics
has been used as an indicator of pharmacodynamic activity
of Smac mimetics, reflecting on-target engagement of
signaling pathways [16, 23]. Our study implies that
determination of TNFα production may not be sufficient
and that TRAIL production and sensitivity has to be
taken into consideration as a biomarker for IFNα/Smac
mimetic cotreatment, too. Noteworthy, sensitivity towards
TRAIL ligand has recently been implicated as a marker
for responsiveness to TRAIL/Smac mimetic combination
treatment in breast carcinoma [24]. In conclusion, our
study provides novel insights on how immunostimulatory
drugs such as IFNα might enhance the efficacy of Smac

Determination of cell death and cell viability

mimetics which might support the use of these drugs in the
treatment of cancer.

Cell death was determined by the analysis of DNA
fragmentation of PI-stained nuclei or by PI staining to
determine plasma membrane permeabilization using flow
cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) as described
previously measuring a total of 104 events per sample [27].
Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and chemicals
Human cell lines were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC;CEM, Manassas, VA,
USA) or Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen
und Zellkulturen (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany)
and cultured in DMEM medium or RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) or McCoy’s
medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biochrom, Berlin,
Germany), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany). IFNα was obtained from Sigma
-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany), zVAD.fmk from
Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany), Nec-1 from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany) and Enbrel from Pfizer (Berlin,
Germany). The bivalent Smac mimetic BV6 was kindly
provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA,
USA). All other chemicals were obtained from SigmaAldrich or Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) unless
indicated otherwise.

Determination of mRNA levels and protein levels
of TNFα and TRAIL
TNFα and TRAIL mRNA levels were determined
by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Total
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed
as previously described [28]. TNFα and TRAIL mRNA
levels were assessed by Taqman Gene Expression Assay
purchased from Life Technologies (TNFα: Hs01113624_
g1, TRAIL: Hs00921974_m1) and the levels of 28S rRNA
by SYBR®Green qPCR assay from Applied Biosystems
(Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the 7900HT fast real-time PCR system
from Applied Biosystems (Darmstadt, Germany); 28S
rRNA forward primer: TTGAAAATCCGGGGGAGAG;
reverse primer: ACATTGTTCCAACATGCCAG. The
relative expression of the target gene transcript and
reference gene transcript was calculated as ΔΔCt. 28S
rRNA was used as reference gene. TRAIL protein levels
in whole cell lysates were determined by Human TRAIL/
TNFSF10 Quantikine ELISA Kit obtained from R&D
Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany) and TNFα levels in the
supernatant of cells were determined by Human TNFα
Ultrasensitive ELISA Kit purchased from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [25] using the following antibodies: mouse
anti-XIAP, mouse anti-RIP1, mouse anti-FADD from
BD Biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany), goat anticIAP1 from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany),
rat anti-cIAP2, mouse anti-caspase 8 from Enzo Life
Sciences (Lörrach, Germany), rabbit anti-caspase-3
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, USA), rabbit
anti-caspase 8 from Epitomics (Burlingame, USA) and
mouse anti-GAPDH from HyTest (Turku, Finnland)
followed by goat-anti-mouse IgG or goat-anti-rabbit
IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, USA).
Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection
from Amersham Bioscience (Freiburg, Germany).
Further, donkey anti-mouse IgG, donkey anti-rabbit IgG
or donkey anti-goat IgG labeled with IRDye infrared
dyes were used for fluorescence detection at 700 nm 800
nm (LI-COR Biotechnology, Bad Homburg, Germany).
Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously
described [26] using RIPA buffer or NP-40 buffer for cell
lysis.

Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface expression
of DR5
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
of cell surface expression of DR5 was done using PEconjugated DR5 antibody (R&D Systems). In brief, cells
were harvested, washed with PBS and incubated in 25 μl
wash buffer (PBS containing 1% goat serum) for 5 min
at room temperature. Afterwards, cells were incubated
with 10 μg/ml anti-DR5 antibody or mouse IgG1-PE as
isotype control for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Cells were
then washed with wash buffer and resuspended in 5 µl/
ml biotinylated F(ab)2 fragments diluted in wash buffer.
After 30 min incubation at 4°C, cells were washed with
wash buffer and incubated in streptavidin-PE for 30 min
