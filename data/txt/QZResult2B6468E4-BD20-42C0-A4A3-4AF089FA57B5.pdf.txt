BACKGROUND: The authors sought to identify socioeconomic (SES) factors associated with adjuvant hormone therapy (HT) use among a contemporary population of older breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Telephone surveys were
conducted among women (ages 65-89 years) residing in 4 states (California, Florida, Illinois, and New York) who
underwent initial breast cancer surgery in 2003. Demographic, SES, and treatment information was collected.
RESULTS: Of 2191 women, 67% received adjuvant HT with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI); 71% of
those women were on an AI. When adjusting for multiple demographic and SES factors, predictors of HT use were
better education (high school degree or higher), better informational/emotional support, and younger age (ages 6579 years). Race/ethnicity, income, and insurance coverage for medication costs were not associated with receiving
HT. For those on HT, when adjusting for all other factors, women were more likely to receive an AI if they had insurance coverage for some or all medication costs, if they were wealthier, if they had better informational/emotional
support, and if they were younger (ages 65-69 years). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of older women in this population-based cohort received adjuvant HT, and the adoption of AIs was early. The results indicted that providers should
be aware that a woman’s education level and support system influence her decision to take HT. Given the high cost
of AIs, their benefits in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and the current finding that women with no insurance coverage for medication costs were significantly less likely to receive an AI, we recC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Approximately 75% of postmenopausal women with breast cancer have hormone receptor-positive disease.1-3

For these women, tamoxifen has been the gold standard of adjuvant hormone therapy.4-6 In the last several years, several
clinical trials have demonstrated the even greater effectiveness of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with tamoxifen in treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive disease.7-9 In 2005, the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended that adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptorpositive breast cancer should include an AI.7 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and St. Gallen
Consensus guidelines also incorporate AIs into adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.8 However, AIs are more expensive than tamoxifen. In 2004, the annual estimated retail cost of an AI
was $2700 to $2900, whereas the annual cost of tamoxifen was approximately $1600.10
Several breast cancer studies have demonstrated that women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have worse survival
compared with women of higher SES; this decrease in survival cannot be explained fully by disparities in the use of screening mammography, cancer stage at presentation, or initial treatment (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy).11-16 We
hypothesized that the cause of this difference in survival may be that women of lower SES are less likely to receive hormone
therapy or, if they do receive it, are less likely to receive an AI. Decreased use in women with lower SES may be attributed

Factors Related to Breast Cancer HT Use/Yen et al

to financial issues or to a poorer understanding of the
rationale for taking hormone therapy in general and,
specifically, for taking the more expensive AIs.
Currently, little is known about the factors that
affect whether a patient with breast cancer receives adjuvant hormone therapy and the extent to which AIs are
being used.17-19 Investigations of this nature in population-based cohorts are limited because information on
hormone receptor status and the receipt of hormone therapy have not been available routinely in either tumor
registry or administrative (Medicare claims) databases.
Therefore, using a contemporary cohort of older community-dwelling women with breast cancer, we sought to
determine the extent to which tamoxifen and AIs are
being used and to identify the SES factors associated with
the receipt of adjuvant hormone therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study sample consists of a population-based cohort of
3083 breast cancer survivors who are participating in a
survey examining breast cancer outcomes, as described
previously.20,21 In brief, community-dwelling women
between ages 65 years and 89 years who resided in 4 geographically diverse states (California, Florida, Illinois, and
New York) were identified initially from Medicare claims
using our validated, claims-based algorithm22 as those
who underwent surgery for an incident breast cancer
between March 2003 to October 2003. The median time
from surgery to the first interview was 33 months. For the
current study, we excluded 873 women who had ductal
carcinoma in situ or unknown stage information and 19
women who had incomplete hormone therapy information. Therefore, the study cohort consists of 2191 women
with invasive breast cancer who had complete hormone
therapy information available.
Data collected from the initial telephone survey
included information on demographic, SES, and treatment factors. Additional hormone therapy use information was collected from 3 subsequent survey waves, which
ended in September 2008. Participants also provided
informed consent for the use of their Medicare claims and
state tumor registry information. Comorbidity scores
were determined from Medicare claims using the methodology described by Klabunde et al.23 Tumor stage information (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Summary Stage 200024) was obtained from the 4 state tumor registries, which are members of the North American
Association of Central Cancer Registries.25 Hormone reCancer

Figure 1. This chart illustrates the study cohort. Adjuvant hormone therapy (HT) use was initiated within 1 year of surgery,
and additional HT information was collected through September 2008. The aromatase inhibitor (AIa) group (n ¼ 1045;
71%) included patients who remained in the AI group and
patients who switched to the AI group. The tamoxifen (Tamb)
group (n ¼ 426; 29%) included patients who remained in the
Tam group and patients who switched to the Tam group.

ceptor status information was available in only 26% of
patients. This study was approved by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and by the institutional
review boards of our institution and all 4 states.
Hormone Therapy Definitions
Receipt of hormone therapy was defined as any hormone
therapy use with tamoxifen or an AI (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) of any duration within 1 year of surgery. The 1-year cutoff was chosen because this time
frame is endorsed by the National Quality Forum as 1 of
its breast cancer quality measures.26 Of 2191 women,
1471 (67%) initiated adjuvant hormone therapy within
1 year of surgery (Fig. 1). Of 792 women who started
receiving an AI, 46 women subsequently switched to
tamoxifen during the study period, which ended in
September 2008. Of 679 women who started receiving
tamoxifen, 299 women (44%) switched to an AI during
the study period. All women subsequently were condensed into 2 groups and categorized as having received
either 1) adjuvant therapy with an AI or 2) adjuvant
therapy with tamoxifen. The AI group (n ¼ 1045) consisted of women who only received an AI (n ¼ 746) and
women who switched from tamoxifen to an AI (n ¼ 299).
The tamoxifen group (n ¼ 426) consisted of women who
only received tamoxifen (n ¼ 380) and women who
switched from an AI to tamoxifen (n ¼ 46). From the
perspective of understanding determinants of ultimate
hormone therapy use, we chose to group the switchers
based on the final drug received for 2 reasons: 1) the
majority of switchers changed from tamoxifen to an AI,
which would be appropriate clinically as suggested by the
ASCO guidelines7; and 2) switching tended to occur early
during the first few months of treatment.

Demographic and Socioeconomic
Status Factors
Patient ages and state geographic locations were determined
from Medicare files.22 Information on all other variables
was obtained by survey response. Age was grouped into 4
categories: ages 65 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79
years, and 80 to 89 years. The race/ethnicity variable was
categorized as ‘‘non-Hispanic white’’ and ‘‘other.’’ ‘‘Other’’
included black or African American (n ¼ 74); Hispanic or
Latino (n ¼ 73); and American Indian/Alaska Native,
Asian, or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander (n ¼ 62).
Marital status was defined by 4 categories: married,
widowed, divorced, and never married. ‘‘Married’’ was
defined as married or living with a partner, and ‘‘divorced’’
was defined as separated or divorced.
Educational attainment was grouped into 3 categories
based on years of education: less than high school, high
school graduate or General Equivalency Diploma (high
school equivalency) degree, and greater than high school
(any posthigh school education, 4-year college degree, professional or graduate degree). Women were asked to estimate their total household income in 2004. Income was
categorized as $15,000, $15,001 to $25,000, $25,001 to
$50,000, and >$50,000. Medication coverage was based
on how much of the cost of prescription medications was
covered by Medicare and/or private health insurance plans
and was defined by 3 categories: none of the cost, some of
the cost, and almost all to all of the cost.
Social support was assessed by using the Medical
Outcomes Study Social Support Scale, which is a validated measure of patients’ perceptions of help and
support available to them in various aspects of life.27,28
Twelve questions were asked, including 8 questions
related to emotional/informational support (eg ‘‘someone
to give you information to help you understand a situation,’’ ‘‘someone to turn to for suggestions about how to
deal with a personal problem’’) and 4 questions related to
tangible support around the time of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment (eg ‘‘someone to take you to the doctor
if you needed it’’). Answers to each item were determined
using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 indicating support
none of the time and 5 indicating support all of the time.
Then, 2 subscale scores (emotional/informational and
tangible) were determined. For each subscale, quartiles
were categorized based on the cohort’s distribution.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcomes were 1) the receipt of any hormone therapy and 2) among the women who initiated

400

hormone therapy, the type of hormone therapy medication received (tamoxifen vs AI). Univariate testing for significant differences in these 2 outcomes according to
baseline characteristics was performed. Differences in the
distribution of characteristics were analyzed with Pearson
chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests. A multiple logistic
regression model was developed to identify characteristics
that were associated independently with the receipt of
hormone therapy simultaneously controlling for all 9 demographic and SES variables. Among 1471 women who
were receiving hormone therapy, a multiple logistic
regression model was developed to determine which characteristics were associated independently with the type of
hormone therapy medication received simultaneously
controlling for all 9 sociodemographic variables. Point
estimates from the model are reported as odds ratios (OR)
along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval
(CI). For both outcomes, the predicted probabilities for
each woman based on the logistic regression model were
calculated and then averaged by either education level or
insurance coverage for medication costs. Data analyses
were conducted using SAS statistical software (version
9.1; SAS Institute; Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The demographic and SES features of the cohort are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of the women in 2003
was 73 years (standard deviation, 5.5 years). Ninety-one
percent of women were Caucasian, and 50% were married. The cohort was distributed fairly well among the 4
states. Eighty-nine percent of women had completed at
least a high school degree. The mean annual income of
the cohort in 2004 was $38,284, and 79% of women had
at least some insurance coverage for medication costs.
More than half of the women in the cohort reported
having social support available to them most or all of the
time (score 4.0). The majority of the women were
healthy (63% had a comorbidity score of 0) and had
lymph node-negative tumors (76%).
Factors Associated With the Receipt of
Hormone Therapy
Of the 2191 study participants, 1471 (67%) initiated adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen or an AI within 1
year after surgery. Of the 792 women who started receiving an AI, 72% received anastrozole, 16% received letrozole, and 11% received exemestane. In the multivariate
logistic regression model (Table 2), when adjusting for

Of the 1471 women on adjuvant hormone therapy, 71%
were receiving an AI, and 29% were receiving tamoxifen
(Fig. 1). Estimates from a multivariate logistic regression
model (Table 3) that also was adjusted for race/ethnicity,
marital status, geographic location, education level, and
tangible support revealed that women were more likely to
receive an AI if they had insurance coverage for medication costs, if they were wealthier (>$50,000 annual
income), if they had better emotional/informational social
support, and if they were younger (ages 65-69 years).
Women who had any insurance coverage for medication
costs, on average, had a 73% model-predicted probability
of receiving an AI compared with 62% among women
with no insurance coverage for medication costs.

anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in terms of
recurrence-free survival.29 In January 2002, the NCCN
endorsed anastrozole as ‘‘an alternative’’ to tamoxifen.
However, it was not until 2005 that ASCO and St. Gallen
each published guidelines recommending adjuvant AI use
for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and the US Food and Drug

Cancer

January 15, 2011

Factors Related to Breast Cancer HT Use/Yen et al

Administration approved the adjuvant use of anastrozole.7,8 In our study, 71% of women who were receiving
adjuvant hormone therapy were on an AI, and >80% of
those women initiated AI use in 2003/2004. This finding
confirms the results of previous studies demonstrating the
substantial early adoption of AIs after the release of the
initial ATAC results in December 2001, well before publication of the ASCO guideline in 2005.17,19,30 This rapid
adoption of adjuvant AI use in the community is remarkable because, in the past, there has been a much slower
adoption of other treatments (breast-conserving surgery)
for breast cancer31,32; and, to date, no overall survival
advantage has been reported from receiving an AI compared with tamoxifen.9
We identified several independent predictors of adjuvant hormone therapy use, including 2 SES factors: education and informational/emotional support (Table 2).
The finding that better educated women (high school
degree or higher) were more likely to receive any adjuvant
hormone therapy is not unexpected, because discussions
regarding the benefits and risks of hormone therapy medications are extensive. Understanding and interpreting this
information, believing that the data support the use of adjuvant hormone therapy, and weighing the pros and cons
of these various medications may be more difficult for less
educated women. Furthermore, women who have a more
robust support system with which to seek advice and opinions may be able to interpret and understand the benefits
of hormone therapy better and may be more comfortable
deciding to take it. When a provider recommends adjuvant hormone therapy, a woman may decide not to follow
this advice for a variety of reasons, and these 2 SES factors
play a role in her decision. It is noteworthy that, when
adjusting for education and informational/emotional support, we observed that race/ethnicity, income, insurance
coverage for medication costs, and tangible social support
were not associated with the receipt of hormone therapy.
Our finding that relatively younger women (ages
65-79 years) were more likely to receive adjuvant hormone therapy is interesting, because the indications for
hormone therapy are not age-related. Physicians and
patients may be considering the possible risks/side effects
associated with hormone therapy (thromboembolic
events, endometrial carcinoma, bone loss) more carefully
in this older population. Our finding of geographic differences with hormone therapy use is not surprising, because
there is much literature demonstrating geographic variations in healthcare and, specifically, in breast cancer
care.32-36

Among the women who were receiving hormone
therapy (Table 3), they were more likely to receive an AI if
they had better informational/emotional support, if they
had insurance coverage for medication costs, if they were
wealthier (>$50,000 annual income), and if they were
younger (ages 65-69 years). Less AI use among relatively
older women may be because both physicians and patients
are particularly concerned with the possibility of additional bone loss associated with AI use and the potential
morbidity of bony fractures in these older women.
Women who have more opportunities to discuss treatment decisions ultimately may come to value and believe
in the benefits of an AI as opposed to tamoxifen compared
with women who have less informational/emotional
support.
We observed that wealthier women (>$50,000 annual income) and, most strikingly, women who had any
insurance coverage for medication costs were more likely
to receive an AI as opposed to tamoxifen. This is not an
unexpected finding given the markedly higher cost of AIs
compared with tamoxifen. The finding that the lack of insurance coverage for medication costs was an important
factor regarding the type of hormone therapy (AI vs tamoxifen) received has healthcare policy implications.
Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer who have no insurance coverage for medication costs may not be receiving an AI because of the financial burden associated with these medications.37 The most
recent ATAC data, at a median of 100 months of followup, continue to demonstrate clearly the long-term efficacy
of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen.9 For more
postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer to derive benefit from adjuvant AI therapy,
the review and possible revision of Medicare Part D and
other insurance policies regarding AI coverage should be
considered.
There are inherent limitations/biases with a survey
study. In addition, our cohort was comprised largely of
non-Hispanic white women, partly because of the underlying racial distribution of the Medicare population in
these 4 states and the predilection of breast cancer among
Caucasian women; therefore, racial/ethnic differences in
the receipt of hormone therapy may not be evident in our
study. Another limitation is that women with the lowest
income status often will have Medicaid pharmaceutical
coverage. The finding of no association between income
status and the initiation of hormone therapy may be
explained by this correlation. We also did not control for
other non-Medicare insurance coverage.

Original Article

We did not have hormone receptor status information from the state tumor registries for the majority of
women. However, we assume that approximately 75% of
these postmenopausal women have hormone receptorpositive breast cancer.2,3 Therefore, a relatively small
proportion of women who may have been eligible for
hormone therapy did not receive it. This finding is
encouraging, because previous population-based studies
have indicated that only 50% to 78% of older women
with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer received
adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.38-41 Finally, our study was
limited to women aged 65 years; therefore, our findings
may not be generalizable to younger postmenopausal
women. However, performing this survey study in Medicare patients allowed us to analyze several demographic
and SES factors that are associated with the receipt of hormone therapy in a large, population-based cohort. To our
knowledge, no other study addressing these particular
issues has been performed. Two studies have reported no
differences in the receipt of tamoxifen between women of
diverse education levels and SES backgrounds15,16; however, those studies were performed in countries that have
national health insurance coverage (United Kingdom and
Sweden), unlike the United States. Furthermore, no studies to date have examined potential differences in the
receipt of AI therapy.
In summary, our current results indicate that SESrelated differences in the receipt of hormone therapy exist
and raise the possibility that SES-related survival disparities may be caused in part by differences in the receipt of
hormone therapy. In this population-based cohort of
older breast cancer survivors, almost all women who were
eligible for hormone therapy received it, and the adoption
of adjuvant AI therapy was early. Better educated women
(high school degree or higher) and women with better
informational/emotional support were more likely to
receive hormone therapy, especially an AI. When counseling women about hormone therapy, providers should be
aware that these 2 factors play a role in a woman’s decision
to take hormone therapy. Surprisingly, other SES factors
(race/ethnicity, income status, and insurance coverage for
medication costs) did not affect hormone therapy use in
this cohort. However, for women who are receiving
hormone therapy, those with no insurance coverage for
medication costs were significantly less likely to receive an
AI than women who had at least some medication coverage. Given this finding, the continued high cost of AIs,
and the clear benefits of adjuvant AI use in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast

cancer, we recommend that policymakers address this
issue.
