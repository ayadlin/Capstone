ABSTRACT
Evidences indicate that tumor development and progression towards a malignant
phenotype depend not only on cancer cells themselves, but are also deeply influenced
by tumor stroma reactivity. The present study uses mesenchymal stem cells from
normal human uterine cervix (hUCESCs), isolated by the minimally invasive method
of routine Pap cervical smear, to study their effect on the three main cell types
in a tumor: cancer cells, fibroblasts and macrophages. Administration of hUCESCsconditioned medium (CM) to a highly invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line and
to human breast tumors with high cell proliferation rates had the effect of reducing
cell proliferation, modifying the cell cycle, inducing apoptosis, and decreasing
invasion. In a xenograft mouse tumor model, hUCESCs-CM reduced tumor growth
and increased overall survival. In cancer-associated fibroblasts, administration of
hUCESCs-CM resulted in reduced cell proliferation, greater apoptosis and decreased
invasion. In addition, hUCESCs-CM inhibited and reverted macrophage differentiation.
The analysis of hUCESCs-CM (fresh and lyophilized) suggests that a complex paracrine
signaling network could be implicated in the anti-tumor potential of hUCESCs.
In light of their anti-tumor potential, the easy cell isolation method, and the
fact that lyophilization of their CM conserves original properties make hUCESCs good
candidates for experimental or clinical applications in anticancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

that tumor development and progression towards a
malignant phenotype depend not only on cancer cells
themselves, but also on tumor stroma reactivity [1], which
may often dictate tumor outcome in breast cancer [25]. The two well-studied cellular components of tumor
stroma are cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [6] and
cancer-associated macrophages (CAMs) [7]. It has been
widely reported that both are key orchestrators of tumor
microenvironment, directly affecting neoplastic cell
growth, neoangiogenesis, and extracellular remodelling

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in
women. Despite early diagnosis, surgery, and adjuvant
therapy, a considerable number of patients recur with
metastatic disease and die as a result. Tumor initiation is
typically conceptualized as the accumulation of genetic
and epigenetic mutations in the epithelium that result in
recruitment of reactive stroma. Evidence exists indicating

[8]. New therapeutic strategies for breast cancer should
consider not only their effect on cancerous cells but also
on stromal cells.
Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs)
are multipotent cells that possess the capability for selfrenewal and are able to differentiate into several types of
mesenchymal cells including adipocytes, osteoblasts, and
chondrocytes [9-11]. MSCs have been isolated from many
types of human adult and fetal tissues, including bone
marrow and adipose tissues, umbilical cord, placenta, and
the uterus [12-20]. However, this generally has required
the use of highly invasive methods. Various studies have
shown that properties and paracrine activities of MSCs
differ according to their origin [21-22].
In recent years, various studies have focused on the
relationship between stem/stromal cells and the oncogenic
process [23]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
prior research is available regarding the effect of MSCs
secretome (conditioned medium) on the neoplastic growth
of both tumor stromal cell types: CAFs and CAMs.
In the present study, we describe the isolation
and growth of MSCs from the human uterine cervix
(human uterine cervical stromal cells, hUCESCs) using
a minimally invasive process. We show that hUCESCs
and their secretome, also called conditioned medium
(hUCESCs-CM), inhibit the aggressive behavior of cancer
cells (cell lines and primary tumors) in vitro and reduce
tumor growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft tumor model.
In addition, we report that hUCESCs have an inhibitory
effect on CAFs proliferation and invasion, and can inhibit
and revert macrophage differentiation.

1.76 in 24 hours (Figure 1C).
To further evaluate hUCESCs cells, we induced
them to form spheroids. After seven days in culture
(Figure 1D), individual cells were maintained in
suspension culture and at day twelve the cells formed
clonal spheroid structures (Figure 1E). We also evaluated
the capacity of hUCESCs for differentiation by adding
specific culture medium. Adipogenic differentiation was
demonstrated by Oil Red O staining (Figure 1F). Calcium
deposition, as marker of osteogenic differentiation was
evaluated by Alizarin Red S staining (Figure 1G). Finally,
secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycans, as markers of
chondrogenic differentiation, were observed after Alcian
Blue staining (Figure 1H).

Effect of hUCESCs on proliferation of human
breast cancer cells
To explore the possible effect of hUCESCs on breast
cancer, after administration of hUCESCs-CM we evaluated
the proliferation/cytotoxicity in the non-invasive human
breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and in the highly invasive
human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. As shown
in Figure 2A-B, after 24 and 48 hours of administration
of hUCESCs-CM (from 24 or 48 h) to MCF-7 cells no
significant decrease of MTT metabolization was observed,
as compared to cells treated with medium without FBS, or
MCF-7-CM self-produced for 24 or 48 h. However, when
the hUCESCs-CM was administered to the MDA-MB-231
cell line, a significant decrease in cell proliferation was
seen at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 2C-D). Previously, similar
data were obtained using the human cervical cancer HeLa
cell line (Supplemental Figure 2). In addition, when
the lyophilized hUCESCs-CM was administred to the
aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line, a dose-dependent
inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure 2E) was observed.
To evaluate whether the effect of hUCESCs-CM on MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was modified by
co-culture with hUCESCs, we labeled MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells with a green dye, and hUCESCs with a
red dye. We found that while MCF-7 cells co-cultured
with hUCESCs grew similarly to MCF-7 cells cultured
alone (Figure 3A and 3C), co-culture of MDA-MB-231
cells with hUCESCs significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the
number of MDA-MB-231cells (Figure 3B and 3C).

RESULTS
Isolation and characterization of hUCESCs
hUCESCs obtained from exfoliation PAP smears of
the uterine cervix were examined for immunophenotype
using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, as
reported previously by Eiro et al., (World Congress on
Cell Science & Stem Cell Research. 2014). hUCESCs are
positive for vimentin and β-catenin, and occasional cells
also immunostained with pan-cytokeratin antibody (clone
AE1AE3) (Figure 1A). In addition, hUCESCs had strong
expression of three transcription factors characteristic of
embryonic stem cells: OCT4, KLF4, and Sox2. hUCESCs
phenotype was also determined by flow cytometry. We
found that these cells were positive for CD29, CD44,
CD73, CD90 and CD105, while they were negative for
CD34, CD45, CD133 (hematopoietic markers), CD31
(endothelial marker), CD117, TRA-1-81 (embryonic
stem cell surface marker), and HLA-DR (Figure 1B and
supplemental figure 1). This phenotype was observed at
different passages. The doubling index of hUCESCs was

hUCESCs-CM modifies cell cycle and induces
apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line
Given that hUCESCs-CM significantly decrease
proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, we next evaluated
cell cycle and apoptosis as possible mediators. MDAMB-231 cells were cultured for 48 h with DMEM plus
10% FBS (+FBS), DMEM without FBS (-FBS), or 48-h
hUCESCs-CM, and then we performed flow cytometry

using propidium iodide (PI) (to evaluate cell cycle), and
annexin V/PI to evaluate apoptosis. In addition, we carried
out Western blots to evaluate the expression of proteins
involved in both cell cycle and apoptosis. Our results
indicate that CM- treated cells significantly increased their
G0-G1 phase in relation to cells treated with complete
(+FBS, P = 0.016) or incomplete (-FBS, P = 0.03)
medium, and decreased their G2-M phase in relation to
+FBS-cultured cells (P = 0.023) and –FBS-cultured cells
(P = 0.013) (Figure 4A). In addition, a visible decrease

in cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin D1 protein expression
was observed in CM-treated cells (Figure 4B). Treatment
of MDA-MB-231 cells with hUCESCs-CM induced an
increase of Annexin+/PI+ (16.7 + 4.8%) positive cells vs.
cells cultured without FBS (-FBS 5.2 + 1.4%) suggesting
that hUCESCs-CM induces late apoptosis (Figure 4C).
Immunoblots of protein extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells
treated with hUCESCs-CM showed a clear increase in
caspase-8, -12, -9, activated caspase-3, and cleaved PARP
(Figure 4D), and a decrease of Bid and Bim (Figure 4E),

with the hUCESCs-CM showed a substantial decrease
in sphere diameter, which was not significant when the
cells were treated with incomplete medium (CM, mean

We next evaluated the effect of intratumoral
administration of hUCESCs-CM in vivo using the severe
immunodeficient (SCID) mouse tumor xenograft model.
Mice were injected with MDA-MB-231 cells stably
transfected with the luciferase vector in the mammary
fat pad. 15 days later, when the tumor became visible,
mice were injected intratumorally every 5 days with
either incomplete medium (controls) or hUCESCs-CM

(Figure 5C). A significant decrease (P = 0.011) in tumor
volume was observed after 15 days of treatment with
hUCESCs-CM (at day 30) (Figure 5D). On day 33,
two animals (one control and one CM-treated mouse)
were euthanized, their tumors removed, and analyzed
by immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 (as
indicator of apoptosis). Figure 5E shows a significantly
higher activated caspase-3 expression in the hUCESCsCM-treated mouse as compared to the control mouse. To
evaluate mouse survival rate, the remaining mice were
injected every 5 days either with hUCESCs-CM or with
incomplete medium, and observed until day 47. KaplanMeier survival plots (Figure 5F) indicate that mice treated

with hUCESCs-CM had a longer overall survival (P =
0.019).

hUCESCs-CM reduces proliferation in breast
tumors with high proliferation rate
Our next step was to evaluate the effect of
administration of hUCESCs-CM on primary cultures of
human breast tumors. Ten primary cultures were analyzed
for cell proliferation using the MTT assay. Similarly to
either incomplete medium (-FBS), self-produced CM
or ASCs-CM, administration of hUCESCs-CM had no
significant effect on cell proliferation on breast tumor

Figure 6: Cell proliferation in primary cultures from human breast tumors with high proliferating rate was
significantly reduced after administration of hUCESCs-CM. (A): Ten primary cultures from human breast tumors were treated

with: a) complete medium (+FBS), b) incomplete medium (-FBS), c) conditioned medium (CM) self-produced for 48 h, d) CM produced
for 48 h by adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs-CM), and e) hUCESCs-CM produced for 48 h. After 48 hours of culture, an MTT assay
was carried out to evaluate cell proliferation. Cultures with high proliferation rate (sample 7 to 10, in red) showed a significantly (***: P
< 0.001) decreased proliferation after treatment with hUCESCs-CM, as compared to others treatments. (B): Protein extracts from primary
cultures with high proliferating rate treated with hUCESCs-CM or with incomplete medium (-FBS) were incubated with cyclin D1, cleaved

Cancer associated fibroblasts are a target of
hUCESCs

cells with a low proliferation rate (sample 1 to 6). On
the other hand, administration of hUCESCs-CM induced
a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in cell proliferation
(Figure 6A) in primary cultures with a high proliferation
rate (sample 7 to 10). A clear decrease in Cyclin D1
and increased cleavage of PARP protein expression was
observed in high proliferative hUCESCs-CM treated cells
(Figure 6B).

Given that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are
involved in the tumorgenicity, we isolated CAFs from one
breast tumor with a high proliferation rate, and evaluated
the effect of hUCESCs-CM administration to them. Figure
7A shows a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in CAFs
proliferation after treatment with hUCESCs-CM, but not
after treatment with ASCs-CM or CAFs-CM. Co-culture
of CAFs with hUCESCs for 72 hours also significantly (P
< 0.001) reduced number of CAFs as compared to growth

Figure 7: Proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of CAFs was modified after hUCESCs-CM treatment. (A): CAFs were

obtained from human breast tumors as described in material and methods section and treated with: a) complete medium (+FBS), b)

cells (ASCs-CM), and e) hUCESCs-CM produced for 48 h. After 48 hours of culture, an MTT assay was carried out to evaluate cell
proliferation. A significant (P < 0.001) decrease in CAFs proliferation after treatment with hUCESCs-CM was observed, as compared
to others treatments. (B): CAFs (1 x 105) were labeled with CellTracker Green dye and plated in 6-well plates. Four hours later 1 x 105
hUCESCs labeled with CellTracker Red dye were added to CAFs and co-cultured in incomplete medium (without FBS) for 72 hours.
Images were taken at 12, 48 and 72 h. The last line shows an example of CAFs growth in incomplete medium (-FBS), which was used

macrophage differentiation by hUCESCs-CM

of CAFs alone (Figure 7B and 7C). CAFs apoptosis
was evaluated 48 hours after treatment either with FBS,
without FBS, or with hUCESCs-CM (Figure 7D). We
observed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in early
apoptosis (Annexin+/PI-) in CAFs treated with hUCESCsCM (19.2 + 4.1%) as compared to CAFs treated with
medium plus FBS (2.2 + 0.9%) and medium without FBS
(3.8 + 1.7%). Invasion of CAFs was also significantly
reduced in presence of hUCESCs-CM with respect to FBS
alone (Figure 7E and 7F).

The inhibition of monocyte to macrophage
differentiation was performed with PMA treatment
during 24 hours in presence of conditioned medium
from hUCESCs or from ASCs (StemPro®, Invitrogen) or
control medium. As shown in Figure 8A, the basal level
of expression of CD11b was 34%, and compared with
the PMA treated control U937 cells, the percentage of
positive cells for CD11b decreased from 73% in PMA
treated U937 cells to 48% in hUCESCs-CM treated U937

cultures and stromal cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft
tumor model in vivo.
According to the minimal criteria proposed by
the “Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of
the International Society for Cellular Therapy” [24],
we found that hUCESCs differentiated into adipocytes,
osteocytes and chondrocytes. In addition, we found that
hUCESCs expressed several markers described for MSCs
and did not express hematopoietic markers, as decribed
previously [20]. However, important differences between
hUCESCs and other MSCs should be highlighted. The
method for obtaining hUCESCs (Pap cervical smear) is
much less invasive and painful that those used to obtain
cervical MSCs (biopsy or hysterectomy) or other MSCs
(from the bone marrow or adipose tissue). In addition,
hUCESCs can be isolated in high quantities, and have a
high proliferative rate, making it possible to quickly obtain
a huge amount of stem cells or conditioned medium for
research and clinical use.
With respect to the role of adult stem cells in
tumorigenesis, contradictory results have been described
regarding induced pro- or anti-tumor effects, both in vitro
and in vivo [23]. These discrepancies in MSC functionality
may also be due to their heterogeneity and to the fact that
no specific surface markers currently exist to isolate a more
homogeneous population. Therefore, a possible alternative
would be to find a MSC-tissue source providing a unique
anti-tumor activity. Our results show specific anti-tumor
effects of hUCESCs-CM on proliferation, apoptosis, and
tumor-cell invasiveness, which differ from those reported
for other MSCs [25-27]. Given the fact that tumor stroma
plays a fundamental role in tumor growth, invasion
and dissemination and that CAFs are the prevailing
component of tumor stroma [28-30], we explored the
effect of hUCESCs-CM treatment on CAFs [31]. We
found that co-culture with hUCESCs as well as treatment
with hUCESCs-CM significantly reduced CAFs cell
proliferation and invasion, and increased early apoptosis.
This finding could be of great importance in light of the
fact that CAFs promote tumor onset and progression in a
variety of ways (angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis)
as well as mediating drug resistance. Indeed, CAFs
are considered a therapeutic target in current clinical
trials [32]. Another key cellular component of tumor
microenvironment [7] are CAMs. They are considered
the most powerful inhibitors of anti-tumor immunity
and the greastest barrier to successful immunotherapy
[33]. Therefore, we explored the effect of hUCESCs-CM
treatment on monocyte to macrophage differentiation. We
observed that treatment with hUCESCs-CM significantly
inhibited and reversed macrophage differentiation. It has
been well documented that high infiltration of CAMs
directly correlates with a poor prognosis in solid tumors,
including breast cancer [34-36].
Our study revealed that hUCESCs-CM had a higher
concentration than control media or ASCs-CM of factors

cells. The percentage of CD11b expression for U937 cells
treated with ASCs-CM was 67%. These data indicate an
inhibition or protection of macrophage differentiation in
the presence of hUCESCs-CM. In Figure 8B, the reversion
of macrophage differentiation is shown: PMA stimulation
during 24 hours followed by addition of hUCESCsCM for another 24 hours. Basal level of U937 CD11b
expression was 38% and compared with the PMA treated
control U937 cells, the percentage of CD11b positive cells
decreased from 82% in PMA treated U937 cells to 34% in
U937 cells treated with hUCESCs-CM. Nevertheless, the
CD11b expression in ASCs-CM treated U937 cells was
77%. It is worth noting that the viability of the U937 cells,
in all conditions and both tests, was higher than 80% (data
not shown). These data indicate that hUCESCs-CM can
reverse macrophage differentiation demonstrated by the
baseline expression of CD11b.

hUCESCs produces cytokines involved in antitumor effect
Using a human cytokine antibody array we
evaluated factors potentially involved in the antitumor effect of hUCESCs-CM. In addition, with the
aim to facilitate the use of hUCESCs-CM in future
experimental and clinical researches, we have lyophilized
it. Lyophilized hUCESCs-CM showed the same activity
than fresh hUCESCs-CM (Figure 8C), and of the 174
cytokines analyzed, 4 cytokines seem to be relevant,
due to their higher expression in hUCESCs-CM, in both
fresh and lyophilized form, and their known role in tumor
inhibition. Indeed, we observed at least 2.5 fold increase
in the level of TNFSF14 (LIGHT) factor in hUCESCsCM compared to ASCs-CM (45 vs 18, p<0.001); whereas
FLT-3 ligand, IP-10 (or CXCL-10) and LAP are increased
at least 3.5 to 4 fold, (FLT-3 ligand: 1146 vs 315, p<0.001;
IP-10: 3623 vs 909 p<0.001, and LAP: 16380 vs 3840,
p<0.001), in hUCESCs-CM compared to ASCs-CM
(Figure 8D). In addition, ASCs-CM presents higher
expression of epidermal growth factor (EGFR), fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) 4 and 9, intercellular adhesion
molecule 3 (ICAM3), interleukine (IL) –6 and its receptor
(IL6R), monocyte-specific chemokine 3 (MCP3, also
called CCL7), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), soluble
glycoprotein 130 (sgp130), vascular endothelial growth
factor D (VEGFD). These markers of tumor progression
were not detected or comparatively were at lower levels in
the hUCESCs-CM. (Figure 8E).

DISCUSSION
In this study, MSCs were isolated for the first time
from the normal human uterine cervix using a minimally
invasive procedure (routine PAP smear). These cells were
evaluated for their effect on cancer cell lines, primary

such as LIGHT (or TNFSF14), Fms-related tyrosine
kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3 ligand), interferon-gammainducible protein-10 (IP-10) and latency-associated
protein [24]. These factors have been associated with
induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell growth, reduced
cell invasion, and tumor inhibition. LIGHT induces
apoptosis through the inactivation of c-IAP1 (apoptosis
inhibitor 1), leading to activation of caspase-9, -7, and –3
[37]. Furthermore, it has been described that FLT-3 ligand
inhibits tumor growth [38] and that IP-10 has anti-tumor
effects through angiostatic and immunogenic action [39].
Indeed, IP-10 is a M1- associated chemokine, reported
to have a high tumoricidal capacity [40]. It has also been
described that IP-10 attenuates fibroblast accumulation
[41]. Therefore, this factor could at least partly explain the
effect of hUCESCs-CM on stromal cells. Regarding LAP,
it is well documented to interact directly with transforming
growth factor beta (TGFb) activators, thus activating
TGFb, which in turn acts as a potent growth inhibitor
[42]. It is also noteworthy that, compared to ASCs-CM,
hUCESCs-CM contain lower levels of factors known to
participate in cancer progression, such as EGFR [43], FGF
4 and 9 [44-45], ICAM3 [46], IL6 [47], IL6R [48], MCP3
(CCL7) [49], MIF [50], sgp130[48] and VEGFD[51].
Thus, indicating that the properties of MSCs and their
secretomes vary depending on source. All of these findings
suggest that a complex paracrine signaling network is
implicated in the anti-tumor potential of hUCESCs.
It is not surprising that the human cervix might be
a reservoir of MSCs with precise site-specific functions.
In fact, the cervical transformation zone is a critical
playground, where fundamental biological events take
place, some of which may be crucial for the host’s
wellbeing. One epithelium, i.e., monolayer glandular
endocervical epithelium, is constantly transformed into
another, multilayer stratified exocervical epithelium, which
is more resistant against external agents, presumably due
to the pool of underlying MSCs. This constant process
of so-called squamous metaplasia especially favors the
accumulation of mutations and the eventual development
of a malignant phenotype, particularly when viruses,
such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), are involved
[52]. Furthermore, regeneration and inflammation are
closely linked in this setting and constitute a standard
model of carcinogenesis [53]. It is therefore reasonable to
hypothesize that MSCs are in possession of some intrinsic
defense mechanisms against inherent vulnerability from
malignant transformation that would otherwise occur
much more frequently. It could be that hUCESCs act as
“guardians of their environment” by preventing adult
cells from acquiring a malignant phenotype, through
modulation of their proliferation rate and induction of
apoptosis if they become dangerous for the host. Indirectly,
our results clearly support this, as hUCESCs were found to
exert no action on low-proliferating epithelial cancer cells
(the MCF7 cell line), whereas their anti-tumor activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

against highly proliferating and metastasis-producing
cancer cells (the MDA-MB-231 cell line) was striking.
In summary, MSCs were isolated from the normal
human uterine cervix by means of routine Pap cervical
smears for the first time. Our findings provide evidence
that administration of hUCESCs-CM to the highly
invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line and
to human breast tumors with high cell proliferation
rates reduces cell proliferation, modifies the cell cycle,
induces apoptosis, and decreases invasion. In addition,
in a xenograft mouse tumor model, intratumoral
administration of hUCESCs-CM reduces tumor growth
and increases overall survival. Importantly, hUCESCs-CM
treatment to CAFs from tumor stroma also reduces cell
proliferation, induces apoptosis and decreases invasion. It
is also noteworthy that hUCESCs-CM inhibit and reverse
macrophage differentiation. These effects could be at least
partly explained by the presence of factors such as LIGHT,
FLT-3 ligand, IP-10 and LAP in hUCESCs-CM, and the
absence or lower levels of several factors related to cancer
progression.
Considering their anti-tumor capabilities, the easy
method for isolating and cultivating cells and the fact that
lyophilizing their CM conserves properties, hUCESCs
may have the potential to provide us with future anticancer
therapies.

METHODS
Ethics statement
All human specimens were encoded to protect
patient confidentiality and processed under protocols
approved by our Regional Research Committee. Breast
cancer tissues and cervical smears were obtained from
patients who underwent surgery or a routine gynecological
check-up at Fundación Hospital de Jove, Asturias, Spain.
All patients provided informed written consent.

Isolation and growth of hUCESCs and cell
cultures
hUCESCs were obtained from routine Pap cervical
smears performed on non-menstruating caucasian women.
In all cases, results of the routine Pap from these fertile
women showed no abnormalities. Briefly, the cytological
sample was enzymatically disaggregated. Then, the
sample was centrifuged 5 min at 400 g and the pellet was
collected and seeded in a culture plate. The sample was
cultured in DMEM-F12 with glutamine, penicillin and
streptomycin, 10% FBS, epidermal growth factor (EGF,
Gibco, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), hydrocortisone
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), insulin (Gibco,
Life Technologies), in an air-CO2 (95:5) atmosphere at
10702

37ºC. The subculture of cells was carried out with trypsin
as described below. The human cervical cancer (HeLa),
breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 and monocyte cell line U937 were obtained
from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury,
UK). The initial experiment to test the interaction of
hUCESCs with tumor cells was carried out with a sitespecific, cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). However, once
proven that such an interaction existed, we decided to
carry out the rest of experiments with breast cancer tumor
lines, both commercially available and established at
our own laboratory in order to avoid the known crosscontamination problems associated with HeLa cells, which
often result in the contamination of any other cell lines
used in a given laboratory [54]. Cell lines were grown in
90-mm Petri dishes in DMEM or RPMI-1640 (U937 cells)
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin
in an air-CO2 (95:5) atmosphere at 37ºC. Confluent
cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
and harvested by a brief incubation with trypsin-EDTA
solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. 	 Ten primary cultures
from women with breast tumors were used in the present
study. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained
as follows: after tumor resection, the pathologist examined
and obtained a representative piece of tumor tissue. The
tumor was mechanically disaggregated by mincing
with scalpel and scissors to 1–2 mm3 in a 6 well plate.
Tissue was digested with 1.25 mg/ml of collagenase
A in complete-DMEM-F12 medium for 48 hours in
an air-CO2 (95:5) atmosphere at 37ºC. For 7 days,
primary cultures were grown in a DMEM-F12 medium,
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor
(EGF), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone and 10 μg/ml insulin.
Afterwards, cells were cultured, at 1500-2000 cells/cm2,
in a DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At
passage 4, mostly fibroblasts remained, then the purity of
CAFs was assessed by immunohistochemistry (positive
expression of α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin, and
negative expression of desmin), and flow cytometry (at
least 70% of CD90 clon AS02 positive cells).
hUCESCs, primary cultures from human breast
tumors, CAFs, and human adipose tissue-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs, StemPro®, Invitrogen,
Life Technologies) were grown, at 1500-2000 cells/ cm2,
in 90-mm Petri dishes in DMEM-F12 (1:1) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin in an air-CO2 (95:5) atmosphere at 37ºC.
Conditioned medium (CM) from hUCESCs, ASCs,
CAFs, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells was obtained by
culturing the cells to 70% confluence as described above.
Afterwards, the cells were washed three times in PBS, and
cultured again in DMEM-F12 without FBS. After 24 or
48h, the medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 300g, the
supernatant was collected, and used immediately.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hUCESCs-CM was also lyophilized (SP Scientific,
25L Genesis 5 Q EL-85, Gardiner, NY, United States) and
then store at -80ºC until used. The lyophilized powder was
then resuspended just before used in ddH2O.
For spheroid formation, hUCESCs were cultured
in DMEM/F12 medium (1:1) (Invitrogen), 1% B27
(Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml EGF, 5 ng/ml fibroblast growth
factor 2 (FGF-2), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/
ml streptomycin in a 60 mm dish, and 12 days later the
spheroids were photographed
To induce adipose differentiation, hUCESCs
were cultured in human MSC Differentiation Bullet kitAdipogenic medium (Lonza Biologics, Walkersville,
USA) in a 60 mm dish during 12 days and then
formaldehyde-fixed for Oil Red O staining. Osteogenic
differentiation was performed with the StemPro®
osteogenic differentiation medium (Gibco, Grand Island,
NY, USA) with Osteogenesis Suplement during 15 days,
and differentiation was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining
(Sigma). For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were
cultured during 21 days with the differentiation media
StemPro® (Gibco) with Chondrogenic Suplement (Gibco).
Differentiation was evaluated by Alcian Blue staining.
For co-culture assays, the cells were cultured as
described above. The medium was removed at 70%
confluence and the cells were labelled with pre-warmed
CellTracker™ solution (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs
with CellTracker™ GREEN CMFDA, and the hUCESCs
with CellTrackerTM RED CMPTX; Invitrogen, Eugene,
USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, 1 × 105
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or CAFs cells/well were plated in
6-well plates, and four hours later 1 × 105 hUCESCs cells
were added to the MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or CAFs and
co-cultured for 72 h. Images were randomly photographed
at 12, 48 and 72 hours with a high-resolution digital
camera (Olympus DP 72; Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
A counting frame (102 μm2) was superimposed on the
captured image in at least four different fields. Only
clearly visible cells were counted in each of the fields
using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA). Results are expressed as relative
number of cells.
Three-dimensional cell culture was performed as
previously described [55]. Briefly, a single-cell suspension
containing 5 × 103 MDA-MB-231 cells per 100 μL volume
of medium, supplemented with 2% (1:1) of Matrigel, was
care­fully placed on top of the solidified Matrigel. The
culture slides were then placed in six-well plates, 500 μL
of medium was added per well, and the cells were cultured
for 10 days. MDA-MB-231 cells were then treated with
different media: a) DMEM-F12 with 10% FBS (+FBS), b)
DMEM-F12 without FBS (-FBS), or c) 48 h-conditioned
medium from hUCESCs (hUCESCs-CM) for 1 week.
Phase contrast photographs of cells as monolayers, or in
three-dimensional cultures, were taken with an Olympus
DP72 camera. The quantitation of sphere diameter was

Western blot analysis

performed manually by tracing a straight line across the
diameter of the sphere and scoring its value as arbitrary
length units.

MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells, and primary cultures
from human breast tumors were lysed at 4ºC in 300 μl
of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl;
5 mM EGTA; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 1% SDS; 10% glycerol;
1% Triton X-100; 10 mM sodium orthovanadate; 4 mM
PMSF, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysate was then
centrifuged at 14,000g for 5 min at 4ºC, the resulting
supernatant was collected, and protein concentration
determined by the Bradford method. Western blotting was
carried out as described elsewhere [57]. Briefly, 60 μg of
total protein was subjected to SDS‑PAGE electrophoresis.
Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
blocked, and immunolabeled overnight at 4ºC with a
primary antibody (see suplemental data table 1), washed
three times with PBS-Tween-20, and incubated with the
appropriate secondary antibody for 1 hour. The signal was
detected with the Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), and visualized
by placing the blot in contact with standard X‑ray film.

Flow cytometry characterization
hUCESCs were stained with a panel of specific
monoclonal antibodies: CD29- PE, CD45-FITC, CD90PE, CD105-PE, HLA-DR-PE (Beckman Coulter,
Marseille, France), CD44-PE, CD73-PE, CD31-PE,
TRA1-81-FITC (Becton Dickinson, Biosciences
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), CD34-FITC, CD117PE and CD133-PE (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7-AAD) (SigmaAldrich) was added for dead cell discrimination.
Differentiation to macrophages on U937 cell
line was monitored by the expression of monocyte
differentiation marker CD11b using flow cytometry
analysis. Cells were stained with PE-CD11b monoclonal
antibody and with 7-AAD to assess cell viability. The
Mac-1 (CD11b) antigen is a cell surface marker for
macrophages.
Immunophenotyping was performed on the same
cell population aliquoted equally into two different tubes.
Stained cells were re-suspended in PBS, and analyzed
using a Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter). The computed data were analyzed using CXP
software provided by the manufacturer.

Cell cycle and Apoptosis assays
Cell cycle and apoptosis assays were carried out
by using a Guava flow cytometer (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA, USA). Briefly, 2 x 105 cells/well were
cultured in: a) DMEM-F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10%
FBS, b) DMEM-F12 (1:1) without FBS, and c) hUCESCsCM. Forty eight hours later, cells were harvested, fixed
with 70% cold ethanol for 30 minutes, washed with
PBS, and incubated with ribonuclease (100 µg/ml),
and propidium iodide (PI, 50 µg/ml) for 60 minutes in
darkness, for cell cycle evaluation. Apoptosis analyses
were performed using Annexin V-FITC. Cells (2 x 105)
were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended
in 1X binding buffer (10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mM
NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2). 5 µl of FITC-Annexin V was
added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in
darkness. Finally, 400 µl of 1X binding buffer was added
to each tube, and analyzed.

Cell proliferation assay
The proliferation rate of hUCESCs was determined
by counting the total number of cells in triplicate every
day for 12 days. Initially, the cells were seeded at 2000
cells/well in a 6-well plate culture. The doubling time [47]
was determined by using the formula: Dt = (t - t0) log2/
(logN - logN0), where t and t0 are the times at which the
cells were counted, and N and N0 are the cell numbers at
times t and t0, respectively.
Cell viability/proliferation experiments were
carried out using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays as previously
described [56]. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, primary cultures
from human breast tumors, or CAFs were plated at a 3
× 104 cells per well in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours
later, the cells were treated with equal volumes (500 μl)
of DMEM-F12 with 10% FBS (+FBS), DMEM-F12
without FBS (-FBS), and 24 or 48 h-conditioned medium
from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, hUCESCs (fresh and
lyophilized), ASCs, CAFs, or primary cultures of breast
cancer tumors, for 24 or 48 h. Absorbance of samples was
measured at 570 nm using a multiwell plate reader (Tecan
ULTRA Evolution, Männedorf, Switzerland). Results were
plotted as the mean + SD values of quadruplicates from at
least three independent experiments.

Cell Invasion Assay
Assays were performed in BD BioCoatMatrigel
invasion chambers according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Biosciences, Madrid, Spain). Filters
precoated with Matrigel were used for examining cell
invasion. MDA-MB-231 cells or CAFs were placed
into the upper chamber in 0.5 ml of DMEM serum-free
medium (5 x 104 cells per filter). DMEN-F12 (1:1) culture
medium supplemented with 20% FBS (controls) or
hUCESCs-CM from 48-h culture, was placed in the lower
chamber supplemented with 20% FBS. After incubation
10704

for 22 hours, cells that had migrated to the lower surface
of the filters were fixed in methanol for 2 minutes at room
temperature, stained using crystal violet for 2 minutes,
visualized and counted. Values for cell migration or
invasion were expressed as the mean number of cells
per microscopic field over four fields per one filter for
duplicate experiments.

Aldrich, respectively. Epitope retrieval was performed
in a PT Link (for 20 minutes at 97ºC) using EnVision
FLEX target retrieval solution (pH 9). All antibodies
were incubated for 20 minutes at RT. As detection system
we used EnVision FLEX/HRP Dako (dextran polymer
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and affinityisolated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins)
for 20 minutes. For E-cadherin, a mouse linker (Dako)
was added. Quantitation of immunopositive cells for
active caspase-3 expression was performed as previously
described [57].

Animal studies
All animal studies were approved by the University
of Santiago de Compostela Ethics Committee for Animal
Experiments. Age-matched female mice between 6-8
weeks old, homozygous for the severe combined immune
deficiency spontaneous mutation (CB17-Prkdcscid, named
SCID, Parc Recerca Biomedica, Barcelona, Spain) were
used for xenografting studies. Thirteen SCID mice (6
controls and 7 treated) were injected subcutaneously
with 3 x 106 MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected
with the pcDNA3-luciferase vector (MDA-MB-231-luc
cells) into the left and right flanks. Fifteen days after cell
injection, the mice were injected intratumorally (150
μl) with 48-hours hUCESCs-CM or with placebo every
five days until day forty-seven. After luciferin injection
(150 mg/kg), tumor growth was monitored externally by
luminescence using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS,
Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA, USA). An intensity
map was obtained using the Living Image software
(Caliper Life Sciences). The software uses a color-based
scale to represent the intensity of each pixel (from blue
representing low to red representing high). One control
and one CM-treated mouse were sacrificed at day thirtyone, and tumors excised, fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 24 hours and embedded in paraffin for
histological and immunohistochemistry studies. All
remaining mice were monitored for survival analyses.

Monocyte to macrophage differentation
U937 cell line was used for this experiment. Cells
were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 x105 cells/
well in DMEM:F12 with 10% FBS and antibiotics. 2ng/
mL of phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was added
to enhance macrophage differentiation. PMA treatment,
which activates protein kinase C, induces a greater degree
of differentiation in U937 cells as reflected by increased
adherence and expression of surface markers associated
with macrophage differentiation. In control wells, no PMA
solution was added.
Analysis of the inhibition of macrophage
differentiation was carried out as follows: PMA treatment
was perfomed for 24 hours in presence of hUCESCs-CM,
ASCs-CM (StemPro®, Invitrogen) or control medium.
In addition, the capacity of hUCESCs-CM to revert
macrophage differentiation was analyzed. For this, PMA
treatment was performed for 24 hours. Then, medium was
removed, cells were washed with PBS, and hUCESCsCM, ASCs-CM (StemPro®, Invitrogen) or control medium
was added for another 24 hours.
In both tests, supernatant was removed and adherent
cells were washed, trypsinized and collected. Cells were
centrifuged for 5 min at 400g and resuspended in 100 μl
of PBS. Differentiation to macrophages was monitored by
the expression of monocyte differentiation marker CD11b
using flow cytometry analysis. Cells were stained with PECD11b monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) and with
7-AAD to assess cell viability.

Immunocytochemistry
hUCESCs were cultured as described above. 3 x 104
cells were seeded in slides, and fixed for 10 minutes in
96% ethanol, before processing for immunocytochemistry.
Mouse tumors were immersion-fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 24 hours and routinely embedded
in paraffin. 4 μm thick sections were mounted on Flex
IHC microscope slides (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
The immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques were
automatically performed in an AutostainerLink 48
(Dako). FLEX ready-to-use Dako primary antibodies
to CK (clone AE1/AE3), E-cadherin (clone NCH-38),
vimentin (clone V9), desmin (clone D33), actin (clone
HHF35), smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4), β-catenin
(clone beta-catenin-1) were employed. KLF4, OCT4,
and Sox2 primary antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, USA), Millipore, and Sigmawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Human Cytokine Antibody Array
Forty eight hours-conditioned medium from
hUCESCs (fresh and lyophilized) and ASCs was subjected
to profiling using RayBio®Human Cytokine Antibody
Array G-Series 2000 that simultaneously detects 174
human cytokines. Culture medium without FBS was run
in parallel as negative control. Signal intensity values
representing detected cytokines were subtracted from the
background and normalized to positive controls on the
same membrane. Experimental steps and analyses were
conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
