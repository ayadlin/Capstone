Abstract
The DNA hypomethylating drug decitabine (DAC) reactivates silenced gene expression in cancer and is
approved for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome. Gene reactivation after DAC is variable and
incompletely understood. Here, we established a cell line system (YB5) derived from the SW48 colon cancer
cell line to study DAC-induced reactivation. YB5 contains a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the locus is transcriptionally silent. GFP reexpression can be
achieved by DAC treatment, but the expression level of individual cells is heterogeneous. DAC-treated YB5
cells were separated into GFP-positive and GFP-negative subpopulations. By comparing DAC-treated sorted
GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we found that their methylation levels were similarly decreased but that
histone modifications and histone H3 densities were remarkably different. Despite a similar degree of (incomplete) DNA hypomethylation, GFP-positive cells reverted to an active chromatin structure marked by higher
H3K9 acetylation, lower H3K27 trimethylation, and lower promoter nucleosome density. GFP-negative cells
had histone modifications and promoter nucleosome density, similar to parental cells. On DAC withdrawal,
gradual resilencing and remethylation occurred in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, and the resilencing correlated with a gradual increase in nucleosome occupancy in GFP-positive cells. These data show that
hypomethylation alone after DAC is insufficient for gene expression induction, and that chromatin resetting
to an active state including nucleosome eviction is required for activation of protein expression. Our findings
suggest that gene expression is the key in optimizing DAC treatment strategies in the clinic. Cancer Res; 70(17);

Introduction
More than 50% of all human promoters are contained in
CpG islands (1), and many show aberrant hypermethylation
in cancer, especially tumor suppressor genes (2, 3). Abrogation of hypermethylation and reversal of epigenetic silencing
is recognized as a powerful tool in cancer therapeutics (4).
The compound decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, or DAC)
is an approved drug in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (5) and is currently in clinical trials in a variety of
solid tumors (6–8). However, the precise mechanisms and
dynamics of gene reactivation after hypomethylation induction are not well understood. DAC inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity and passive global hypomethylation is induced

when the cells divide (9). Eventually, this hypomethylation
restores gene expression at silent promoters (10). The required minimum degree of hypomethylation for gene reactivation is largely unknown. DNA methylation has been
associated with an altered chromatin structure, presumed
to be related to recruitment of histone modifiers by DNA
methylation (2, 11). This has been proposed to explain the
observed synergy at the gene expression level between DAC
and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (12). It has also
been suggested that gene reactivation after DAC happens despite persistent or increased binding by polycomb group proteins (13), which usually silence gene expression. Part of the
difficulty in understanding the precise events after DAC exposure is the marked cell-to-cell and gene-to-gene heterogeneity in gene reactivation. This heterogeneity implies that, in
most studies, mixed populations of expressing/nonexpressing
cells are examined.
To overcome this problem, we developed a cell line system
whereby green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression is controlled by a methylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.
After sorting GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we observe that DAC-induced gene expression does not require full
demethylation, and that induction of hypomethylation alone
is not sufficient to activate gene expression. The essential determinant seems to be chromatin remodeling to an active
state after hypomethylation induction. Our findings also

cloning. The isolated single clones were further examined
for transgene copy number using real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2) and for genomic insertion site using
inverse PCR (Fig. 1B).

Materials and Methods
Transfection of a methylated pCMV-GFP construct and
clone characterization
A patch methylated construct was modified from pEGFPN1 (Clontech). By in vitro methylation (SssI methylase;
NEB), restriction enzyme (PciI and BglII; NEB) digestion,
and religation (T4 ligase; NEB), the final construct had
the methylation restricted to the pCMV region (Fig. 1A).
The linearized patch-methylated construct was transfected
into SW48 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After
G418 (Invitrogen) selection, GFP-negative cells were selected out using a FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences) for single-cell

Cell culture, drug treatment, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis, and cell sorting
Both SW48 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and
the derived single-cell clones were cultured in IL-15 medium
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/mL streptomycinpenicillin. Daily treatment with DAC (Sigma) was adopted
for GFP reactivation. GFP-positive cell percentages were
measured using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer; GFP cell
sorting was conducted using BD FACSAriaII. Post-sorting
analysis was performed to assess the purity of the groups.
Flow sorting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
data were processed using FlowJo (TreeStar).

DNA extraction, bisulfite conversion, and
methylation analysis
Extraction and bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA were
carried out as described previously (14–16). Pyrosequencing
and bisulfite cloning/sequencing were used to study methylation levels. Primers/conditions are listed in Supplementary
Table S1.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, quantitative real-time
PCR, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen); the
residual genomic DNA was removed using DNA-Free kit
(Ambion); and cDNA was synthesized using High-Capacity
cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of cDNA
was done by real-time PCR using ABI Prism 7900HT system. All cDNA products were amplified with the Universal
PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and done in triplicate. GAPDH
was used as a reference gene. Primers/probes are listed
in Supplementary Table S1. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (5′-RACE) was done using a 5′-RACE kit (Invitrogen)
to determine the transcription start site (TSS) of GFP gene.
Total RNA from 100 nmol/L DAC–treated YB5 cells was
used as template and the GFP-specific primers are listed
in Supplementary Table S1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses were
performed as described previously (17). Cells were 1% formaldehyde fixed and lysed followed by sonication shearing
using the Biorupter (Diagenode). Antibodies used were
anti–histone H3 (ab1791, Abcam), anti–histone H3K9 acetylation (07-352, Millipore), anti–histone H3K27 trimethylation (07-449, Millipore), and anti-IgG (ab46540, Abcam).
The value of each histone mark was determined by H3 and
IgG normalization using the following equation: enrichment =
2[Ct(H3) − Ct(Ab)] − 2[Ct(H3) − Ct(IgG)]. The value of histone H3 protein enrichment was determined by input control. One percent
of chromatin was used as input control. Quantification of ChIP
DNA was done by real-time PCR, and primers/probes are listed
in Supplementary Table S1.
Histone preparation and Western blots
Total histones were prepared by acidic extraction and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (18). Additional antibodies used were anti–pan-acetylated histone H4
(06-866, Millipore) and anti–histone H4 (07-108, Millipore).

Results
An integrated and silenced CMV-GFP transgene
We started deriving a DNA methylation reporter assay by
transfecting an in vitro methylated CMV-GFP transgene into
the colon cancer cell line SW48, which has intense hypermethylation of multiple genes characteristic of the CIMP
subtype of colon cancers (19). CMV promoter is >500 bp in
length and includes 30 CpG sites with a CpG percentage of
6%; the ObsCpG/ExpCpG ratio is 0.89 and the GC content is
50%. Thus, the CMV promoter is a classic CpG island follow-

ing Gardiner-Garden and Frommer's criteria. The outline of
generating a patch-hypermethylated plasmid and transfection into SW48 is presented in Fig. 1A. After selection, sorting, and single-cell cloning, we tested multiple isolates for the
required characteristics (integrated intact transgene, silenced
gene expression) and characterized one, YB5, in detail. We
used quantitative PCR to determine that the transgene dosage in YB5 genome was one (Supplementary Fig. S2). Copy
number did not change over a time period of up to 15 months
(data not shown). We next used inverse PCR to determine
the integration site. The resulting PCR product contained a
774-bp-long sequence with 100% homology to position
73061660–73062433 of the minus strand on chromosome 1
in the UCSC BLAT database (hg18, March 2006; Fig. 1B).
Thus, the transgene integrated into an intragenic region of
human EST CD655906 on chromosome 1p31.1. We also used
a GFP-expressing clone, YB11, which contained one copy of
CMV-GFP transgene at chromosome 19p13.3 region as a positive control for subsequent experiments.
DNA methylation controls silencing of the transgene
We used quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing and bisulfite cloning/sequencing to study the DNA methylation state
of the transgene in detail. Bisulfite pyrosequencing revealed
that the CMV promoter in the GFP-expressing clone YB11
was unmethylated, whereas the silenced clone YB5 was
hypermethylated from −337 to +19 bp of the transcription
start site (Fig. 2A). This region covers the core CMV promoter
and contains 22 CpG sites with an average methylation level
>80%. Analysis of early and late cell passages of YB5 showed
that the methylation pattern is stable. The hypermethylation
pattern was also confirmed by bisulfite cloning/sequencing
using another set of PCR primers (Fig. 2B). Almost every
CpG site had very high levels of DNA methylation, with
the exception of two CpG sites that correspond to cAMPresponsive element binding protein (CREB) binding sites
indicated by Genomatix Software analysis. Interestingly, we
detected no binding of CREB or phospho-CREB to the region
in the YB5 cells, whereas binding was detected in YB11 by
ChIP assays (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Next, we investigated the effect of CMV hypermethylation
on the expression of the GFP gene. Using quantitative realtime PCR, we found robust GFP expression in YB11 and no
GFP mRNA in YB5 and SW48. Using the hypomethylating
agent DAC at different concentrations (from 10 to 200
nmol/L), the YB5 GFP gene could be reactivated in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A). Because DAC can have effects
independent of DNA methylation (20), we also tested whether gene reactivation can be achieved by directly inhibiting
DNMT1, the main DNA methyltransferase. Using DNMT1
siRNA knockdown (21), we found efficient GFP reactivation
compared with the scrambled control. By contrast, knockdown of EZH2 had no effect on GFP reactivation (Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, to determine whether the
DAC-reactivated GFP transcript is driven by the CMV promoter, a 5′RACE experiment was conducted, which confirmed that the GFP mRNA starts from the 3′end of the
CMV promoter. Thus, the integrated transgene is silenced

by DNA methylation and mimics endogenous tumor suppressor gene silencing in cancer.
Heterogeneous GFP reactivation after DAC
We next used FACS flow cytometry to analyze GFP reactivation. As can been seen in Fig. 3B, SW48 and YB5 cells
stayed at the GFP-negative region and YB11 fell into the
GFP-positive region, whereas the 100 nmol/L DAC–treated
YB5 cells exhibited a distribution shift to the GFP-positive
region. The percentages of GFP-positive cells under the gradient DAC treatment are summarized in Fig. 3C. The correlation of GFP percentages from FACS analysis with mRNA
expression levels determined by quantitative real-time PCR
was analyzed and found an R2 value of 0.97 (Fig. 3D). Taking
advantage of the single-cell detection of GFP expression
enabled by flow analysis, we observed a large difference in
expression levels of individual cells originating from an identical cell population after a demethylating stimulus. Moreover,
the proportion of cells positive for GFP did not exceed 40%,
even with increasing doses or duration of exposure. Previous
studies analyzed DAC-treated cells as a uniform population,
whereas the single-cell analysis captures this very heterogeneous behavior.
Hypomethylation is not sufficient to activate
GFP expression
To explore the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in
gene expression after DAC treatment, we separated GFPpositive and GFP-negative subpopulations using a cell sorting cytometer (Fig. 4A). Post-sorting analysis revealed that
the purity of sorted populations was about 85% in the
GFP-positive subpopulation and 98% in the GFP-negative

www.aacrjournals.org

subpopulation. The sorted cells were collected and methylation levels were studied. The first question we asked is
whether the difference in gene expression is simply due to
lack of hypomethylation in a subpopulation of cells, perhaps
related to quiescence at the time of exposure. The CMV promoter methylation was first investigated using pyrosequencing and found that the GFP-positive cells demethylated
from 81.4 ± 0.2% to 45.4 ± 0.2% and the GFP-negative cells
to 51.1 ± 0.1% (Fig. 4B). We next used bisulfite cloning/
sequencing on these cells and found that DNA methylation
is mosaic and overall similar between positive and negative
cells (Fig. 4C). Besides the CMV promoter, we also examined
global methylation status using the long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE1) repetitive element (22, 23), and we
found that global methylation decreased from 58.0 ± 0.3%
to 39.0 ± 0.4% in GFP-positive cells and to 41.9 ± 0.1% in
GFP-negative cells. Similarly, we found no differences in
methylation levels of genes P16INK4a, CDH13, RASSF1a, RARβ2,
and PGRB between sorted subpopulations (Fig. 4D, left). The
expressions of P16INK4a, RASSF1a, and PGRB were measured,
and P16INK4a and RASSF1a were reactivated by DAC whereas
PGRB was not. Similar to GFP, the expressions of P16INK4a
and RASSF1a were higher in GFP-positive cells than in GFPnegative cells (Fig. 4D, right). These data suggest that a
decrease in methylation may be necessary but is not sufficient
for gene reactivation after DAC; other critical events must
be involved. Cell cycle distributions of GFP-positive and
GFP-negative cells were analyzed, but no differences were
found (data not shown).
To ensure that our results are not strictly due to the presence of hemimethylated DNA, we repeated the experiment
with a one-time DAC treatment, and we still saw partial

methylation associated with transcription and a relatively
small difference between GFP-positive and GFP-negative
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Chromatin reprogramming is required for activated
GFP expression
Because chromatin structure is also critical to regulate
silencing and gene expression in mammalian cells, we examined histone modifications in parental cells and DAC-treated
GFP-positive/GFP-negative subpopulations. Several modification marks were investigated using ChIP assays, including
histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac), lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), and
lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Three regions along the
CMV-GFP locus were studied, including the promoter region
(−200 bp), TSS region, and GFP coding region (+400 bp).
The parental YB5 cells exhibited a closed chromatin structure, devoid of H3K9ac and enriched for H3K27me3, whereas
the expressing YB11 cells were just the opposite. After DAC,
the hypomethylated GFP-negative cells were similar to parental cells, retaining low H3K9ac and high H3K27me3 levels,

whereas the GFP-positive cells showed chromatin reverting
to an active state, with 2.5- to 5-fold higher level of H3K9ac
and 2.5- to 8-fold lower level of H3K27me3 compared with
the GFP-negative cells. Although histone H3K4me3 and
H3K9me3 were different between YB5 and YB11 cells, they
were not found to be distinguishable in GFP-positive and
GFP-negative cells. Also, the ChIP assay did not show binding
of CREB in either GFP-positive or GFP-negative cells (data
not shown). Interestingly, histone H3 densities at the
promoter and TSS regions were found to be very different
between GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells. The GFPpositive cells showed H3 loss, suggesting promoter nucleosome eviction, whereas the GFP-negative cells retained most
of the histone H3 of the parental YB5 cells (Fig. 5A). By contrast, we performed Western blot analysis and found no differences in global histone marks between the GFP-positive
and GFP-negative cell populations (Fig. 5B).
To verify that the active chromatin state could occur
despite residual DNA methylation, we performed bisulfite
pyrosequencing on DNA immunoprecipitated with histone
H3K9ac and histone H3K27me3 antibodies. We found that

H3K9ac-bound DNA is 31% methylated, H3K9ac-unbound
DNA is 56% methylated, H3K27me3-bound DNA is 59%
methylated, and H3K27me3-unbound DNA is 54% methylated. The methylation level is the average of seven CpG sites
located from −104 to −41 bp from the TSS. These data show
that at the CMV promoter locus, H3K9-acetylated histones
can be present on methylated DNA, but shows a preference
to less methylated DNA; H3K27-trimethylated histones have
no particular DNA methylation preference (Supplementary
Fig. S6).
HDAC inhibitors can increase global histone acetylation;
we therefore asked if altering histone marks by treatment
with the HDAC inhibitor TSA would promote the expres-

sion of the sorted GFP-negative cells. Low doses of TSA
showed no effect on the fully methylated YB5 cells. As
shown in Fig. 5C, 24 hours after sorting, the hypomethylated but initially GFP-negative cells had about 12% GFPpositive cells, likely representing the continuing effects of
DAC. TSA treatment increased this number to 46%, which
indicated that the synergy was achieved at the GFP locus.
As expected, in GFP-positive cells, TSA had little effect on
boosting gene expression further. Using ChIP assays, we
confirmed that TSA treatment elevated histone H3K9ac at
the CMV locus but decreased histone H3K27me3. However,
the post-TSA treatment did not affect histone H3 density in
GFP-negative cells (data not shown).

GFP expression has no effect on DNA remethylation
After DAC-induced hypomethylation, gene remethylation is
the norm (24, 25), although the mechanisms of this phenomenon are unknown. It has been proposed that a residual
closed chromatin state predisposes to remethylation and that
high levels of gene expression may protect against remethylation (26). This important question could be addressed using
this model. To do this, we cultured the sorted cells separately
and followed DNA methylation over time. The percentage of
GFP-positive cells over a 48-day period is shown in Fig. 6A and
the methylation at each time point is shown in Fig. 6B. As can
be seen, after DAC withdrawal, GFP-positive cells decreased
in a two-phase fashion: a rapid reduction at the first several
days (up to day 5) and a slow decrease later on. Remethylation
occurs in both populations, and the rate of remethylation is
identical in sorted GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells. We
also tested the effect of prolonged TSA treatment, but it did
not prevent remethylation of either GFP-positive cells or GFPnegative cells (data not shown).
Because gene expression seems to decline more rapidly
than DNA remethylation, we examined chromatin changes

focusing on the nucleosome occupancy of promoter and
TSS regions. Histone H3 densities of GFP-positive and GFPnegative cells at day 2 and day 5 were examined. Combining
the day 0 data from Fig. 5A, the nucleosome recovery kinetics
is shown in Fig. 6C. We found that an increase in histone H3
occurred rapidly after DAC withdrawal, and the speed of
GFP-positive cells was faster than that of GFP-negative cells.
This nucleosome reassembly in GFP-positive cells seems to
be correlated with the rapid phase of GFP resilencing. Collectively, the DAC-induced chromatin remodeling is short lived.
The rate of DNA remethylation was not dependent on the
expression levels or chromatin structure after DAC and thus
may relate to the residual DNA methylation marks near the
CMV-GFP locus.

Discussion
In this study, we describe a new model system YB5, which
contains a hypermethylated and silenced CMV-driven GFP
gene, with stably inherited epigenetic properties established
over time. In this model, the promoter is DNA hypermethylated

and has a closed chromatin structure characterized by histone
H3K9 deacetylation and H3K27 hypermethylation. Expression
is suppressed at the transcriptional level and can be restored
by using the demethylating agent DAC or by inhibiting
DNMT1 expression. Thus, this system mimics many of the
features of typical gene silencing in mammalian cells, including cancer cells. CMV is a strong CpG island–containing promoter, and it can be efficiently silenced as previously reported
(27, 28). Because reactivated gene expression can be easily
visualized and selected for, this model allowed us to ask important questions about the minimal requirements for gene
reactivation, as well as to track resilencing after epigenetic
modulation. These questions have previously been investigated primarily from the perspective of entire (mixed) cell populations, although one study used subcloning and gene
expression selection to ask questions about remethylation (9).
We first asked about the association between hypomethylation induction and gene reactivation. Surprisingly,
methylation studies showed similar demethylation levels
between GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, which suggests that pharmacologic uptake of DAC is uniform and
not rate-limiting in these cells. In sorted cells that had high
GFP expression, DNA methylation did not decrease to normal levels (nearly zero), suggesting that a previous hypothesis about heterogeneous reexpression being explained by a
mixture of cells demethylated to 0% (and reexpressing)
while others remain hypermethylated and silenced is incorrect. In fact, only 6 of 24 alleles sequenced had complete
demethylation in these cells with high GFP expression.
Thus, only a moderate degree of DNA hypomethylation is
required for gene reactivation. In our experiments, we ruled
out activation of an alternative host promoter as a possible
explanation. However, further experiments may be needed
to verify that methylated CpG islands can still have promoter activity if they retain an open chromatin. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of H3K9ac histones showed about 30%
DNA methylation, confirming that the gene can be activated despite residual DNA methylation, but also suggesting

that unmethylated alleles are enriched in open chromatin.
Moreover, in our data, the GFP-negative cells after DAC
also had decreased DNA methylation levels, showing that
DNA hypomethylation per se is not sufficient for gene reactivation. Rather, the main molecular difference between
GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells after DAC was the differential histone modifications and histone H3 densities revealed by ChIP assays. Thus, chromatin resetting is the
prime factor determining gene reexpression state after
DAC-induced DNA demethylation. Interestingly, it has previously been reported that DAC induces nuclease sensitivity
changes in the human HPRT gene locus before gene reexpression (29) and decreased nucleosome occupancy of
hMLH1 promoter after DAC (30), which are consistent with
our data.
It is interesting to ask why a relatively small degree of
DNA demethylation would naturally, but not uniformly,
bring histone changes and chromatin resetting. A possible
explanation is that in the absence of DNMTs, the coupled
assembly of newly synthesized histone octamers during cellular replication may be disrupted. The nascent histone octamers lose some original repressive histone tail marks, the
promoter nucleosome assembly is disabled, and the chromatin alters to a locally open structure, resulting in transcription of this strand of DNA (31, 32). Indeed, DNMT1
and DNMT3b have been reported to bind to HDACs, histone methyltransferases, and chromatin scaffold proteins,
and it is possible that this binding is important to replication of histone marks. It is interesting to note that after
withdrawal of DAC, about 12% of sorted GFP-negative cells
transform to expressing cells after 24 hours in regular
growth medium, which indicates the continuing chromatin
resetting. This model also explains the observed synergistic
effect between DNA demethylating agents and low-dose
HDAC inhibitors (12).
The cell sorting strategy also allowed us to address the vexing problem of gene resilencing and remethylation after DAC
withdrawal. Using a mixed cell population, it was previously

reported that the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 persists
or increases after DAC treatment (13) and thus serves as a
nidus for resilencing. Our data using purified cells are not consistent with these observations. Rather, we find that resilencing and remethylation are independent of gene expression
levels or of local chromatin structure. The kinetics of DNA remethylation is quite flat, which can be cell division related
(33). However, loss of expression after DAC withdrawal is very
rapid in the first several days (seen at day 2 and day 5). Notably,
the speed of histone H3 gains up to day 5 is also prompt, which
seems to be coincident with rapid GFP loss. Thus, it is highly
likely that the first resilencing is due to the reassembly of nucleosomes, although the driving force of repackaging DNA is
unknown. It is possible that a closed chromatin configuration
persists in cis away from the CMV promoter and underlies
gene resilencing.
It remains to be seen how much the data we have generated with this in vitro system are applicable to endogenous
gene silencing. All indications are that they would be—the
transgene is stably integrated, shows the typical methylationassociated closed chromatin configuration, and is reactivated
by DAC or DNMT1 knockdown with similar kinetics and
patterns as endogenous genes. Nevertheless, it is likely that
there will be gene- or locus-specific events that influence
reactivation Indeed, some genes are silenced without detectable H3K27me3 (33), and those may behave differently. Similarly, promoters vary in their CpG density and degree of
DNA methylation, and this could influence gene reactivation
patterns.
Our data have clinical implications for the use of DNA
methylation inhibitors. In treated patients, relatively small
decreases in DNA methylation were observed (34, 35), but

these were accompanied by significant gene reactivation
and clinical responses. Moreover, as would be predicted from
the current data, gene reactivation was a better predictor of
response than hypomethylation induction (36, 37). In a similar manner to the in vitro situation, gene remethylation was
observed, and a higher extent of remethylation was associated with resistance to therapy (35).
In summary, we found that DNA hypomethylation is necessary but not sufficient for gene reactivation after DAC. Rather,
local chromatin structure resetting, which can happen at a low
level of DNA demethylation, is a key determinant of actual
gene reexpression. These data have implications for the use
of hypomethylating drugs in the clinic. In addition, the YB5
system can be useful for evaluating potential demethylating
compounds and epigenetic synergy studies to boost gene reactivation as well as prevent resilencing and remethylation.
