Abstract
Small-molecule inhibitors of PARP1/2, such as olaparib, have been proposed to serve as a synthetic lethal
therapy for cancers that harbor BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Indeed, in clinical trials, PARP1/2 inhibitors elicit
sustained antitumor responses in patients with germline BRCA gene mutations. In hypothesizing that additional
genetic determinants might direct use of these drugs, we conducted a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen for
candidate olaparib sensitivity genes. In support of this hypothesis, the set of identiﬁed genes included known
determinants of olaparib sensitivity, such as BRCA1, RAD51, and Fanconi's anemia susceptibility genes. In
addition, the set included genes implicated in established networks of DNA repair, DNA cohesion, and chromatin
remodeling, none of which were known previously to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition. Notably,
integration of the list of candidate sensitivity genes with data from tumor DNA sequencing studies identiﬁed
CDK12 deﬁciency as a clinically relevant biomarker of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity. In models of high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OVCa), CDK12 attenuation was sufﬁcient to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition,
suppression of DNA repair via homologous recombination, and reduced expression of BRCA1. As one of only nine
genes known to be signiﬁcantly mutated in HGS-OVCa, CDK12 has properties that should conﬁrm interest in its
use as a biomarker, particularly in ongoing clinical trials of PARP1/2 inhibitors and other agents that trigger
replication fork arrest. Cancer Res; 74(1); 287–97. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Enzymes within the PARP superfamily catalyze the polymerization of PAR chains on substrate proteins, using b-NADþ
as a cofactor (PARylation). The best-studied member of this
superfamily, PARP1, has a relatively well-deﬁned role in the
DNA damage response (DDR) and binds damaged DNA, PARylates DNA repair effectors such as XRCC1 and conducts
autoPARylation, an event that drives its release from DNA (1).
Small-molecule PARP1 inhibitors, which also inhibit the
homologous PARP2 enzyme (hereafter referred to as PARP1/2
inhibitors), were originally developed as chemo- and radiosensitizing agents. These agents also elicit synthetic lethality

in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deﬁcient cells, an observation that led to
their clinical assessment in patients with germline BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutations (2). In phase 1 and 2 trials, olaparib singleagent treatment has delivered signiﬁcant and sustained antitumor responses in patients with germline BRCA mutations,
without causing many of the side effects associated with
standard chemotherapies. Furthermore, when used as a maintenance therapy after carboplatin treatment in patients with
high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OVCa), a disease characterized by a relatively high frequency of familial and somatic
BRCA mutations, olaparib (KuDos/AstraZeneca) has been
shown to signiﬁcantly improve progression-free survival (PFS)
when compared with a placebo and in patients with BRCA1- or
BRCA2-mutant tumors and can reduce the time to recurrence
by approximately 85% (3, 4).
So far, the genetic dissection of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity
has relied upon the study of single genes involved in DNA repair
(5) or small subsets of genes/proteins, such as the kinome (6).
To identify novel genetic determinants of PARP1/2 inhibitor
sensitivity that could have an impact on the clinical development of these agents, we conducted a genome-wide PARP1/2
inhibitor synthetic lethal screen. The results of this screen
conﬁrm the impact of the DDR on the cellular response to
PARP1/2 inhibition and identify novel genetic determinants,
such as CDK12, that could be used as candidate predictive
biomarkers in both existing and future clinical trials.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The PARP inhibitor AZD2281/Olaparib was obtained from
Selleck Chemical, and paclitaxel and cisplatin were obtained
from Sigma Aldrich. Drugs were used as previously described
(7–9).
Short hairpin RNA screen
We used the OpenBiosystems GIPZ human short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) library. Viral pools encompassing about 9,500
shRNAs were used to transduce MCF7 cells with a ﬁnal
representation of about 1,000 cells per shRNA construct (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Seventy-two hours after infection, cells
were divided into cohorts and exposed to either 1.5 mmol/L
olaparib or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 14 days. shRNA
representation in the surviving cell populations was estimated
via massively parallel sequencing as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Immunohistochemistry
The quantiﬁcation of nuclear RAD51 foci was conducted as
described previously (7). See also Supplementary Materials and
Methods for details.

Cell lines
PEO1, PEO14, OV56, COV318, COV504, and SKOV3 were
obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures. PEO1 and
PEO14 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 containing 2 mmol/L
glutamine, 2 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 10% (v/v) FBS.
OV56 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM):F12 Nutrient Mixture containing 2 mmol/L glutamine, 5% (v/v) FBS, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich),
and 10 mg/mL insulin (Sigma Aldrich). COV318 and COV504
cells were grown in DMEM containing 2 mmol/L glutamine
and 10% (v/v) FBS. SKOV3 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A
media containing 2 mmol/L glutamine and 15% (v/v) FBS.
OV90 and CAOV3 were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. OV90 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of MCDB105
containing 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate and Medium 199 containing 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate and 15% (v/v) FBS. CAOV3
cells were grown in DMEM containing 2 mmol/L glutamine
and 10% (v/v) FBS. The identity of cell lines was conﬁrmed by
short tandem repeat (STR) typing using the StemElite Kit
(Promega) in February 2013. Cell lines were conﬁrmed as being
mycoplasma negative using the MycoAlert Kit (Lonza) routinely throughout experimentation. Cell lines were transfected
with SMARTpool siRNAs obtained from Dharmacon or Santa
Cruz Biotech using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) transfection reagent
(see also Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Survival analysis
Overall survival (OS) analysis was conducted using stage
II–IV HGS-OVCa samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) dataset (13–15) as described in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Protein analysis
Cells were lysed in NP250 buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.6,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 250 mmol/L NaCl) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Protein quantiﬁcation was estimated using BioRad Protein Assay Reagent
(BioRad). Whole-cell lysates were electrophoresed on Novex
4% to 12% gradient bis–tris pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) and
immunoblotted overnight at 4 C with antibodies listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Homologous recombination assay
A synthetic repair reporter was used as previously described
(8, 10–12). HeLa cells harboring a single-copy genomic integration of the DR-GFP reporter were transfected with siRNA

288

targeting CDK12, BRCA1, BRCA2, or an siControl. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were transfected with the I-SceI expression
vector, pcBASce, or an empty vector control (11). Forty-eight
hours later, homologous recombination (HR) frequency was
estimated by quantifying the frequency of GFP-positive cells
using ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; ref. 11).

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR was carried out using
Assay-on-Demand primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems).
Gene expression was calculated relative to the expression of
GAPDH and adjusted relative to expression in nontargeting
shRNA (shNTC)-infected cells.

In vivo efﬁcacy studies
In vivo efﬁcacy study was conducted using OV90 cells
infected with either shNTC or shCDK12 expression constructs.
A detailed protocol is described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Results
A genome-wide synthetic lethality screen for sensitivity
to a clinical PARP1/2 inhibitor
To identify determinants of PARP1/2 inhibitor response,
we designed a high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi)
synthetic lethality screen (Supplementary Fig. S1A). For this
screen, we selected MCF7 breast tumor cells as they are
BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild-type, olaparib-resistant (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and amenable to high-efﬁciency lentiviral
infection (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Cells were infected with
a GIPZ human shRNA library encompassing 57,540 lentiviral
shRNA expression constructs targeting 16,487 unique human
protein-coding genes (Ensembl 56). The shRNA library was
divided into 6 pools, with each pool encompassing between
9,541 and 9,601 shRNAs. MCF7 cells were infected with each
GIPZ pool at a multiplicity of infection of 0.8, generating
about 1,000 infected cells per shRNA construct. This ratio of
cells infected per shRNA construct was maintained throughout the experiment (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Seventy-two
hours after infection, cell populations were divided into 2
cohorts, one exposed to the clinical PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib (KuDOS/AstraZeneca) and the other exposed to DMSO,
the olaparib vehicle. To maximize the potential for identifying
synthetic lethal/sensitizing effects, cells were exposed to 1.5
mmol/L olaparib, a concentration that caused a 20% reduction in cell survival (surviving fraction 80, SF80; Supplementary Fig. S1B). In total, cells were exposed to olaparib or DMSO

CDK12 and PARP Inhibitor Sensitivity

for 14 days (10 population doublings) so as to model chronic
olaparib exposure as used in the clinic.
To identify shRNA constructs that modulated the response to
olaparib, we estimated shRNA enrichment and depletion in cells
that survived olaparib or DMSO exposure using massively
parallel sequencing. In brief, gDNA from surviving cell populations was recovered and shRNA target sequences were PCRampliﬁed using primer sequences compatible with Illumina
GAIIx sequencing (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).
PCR amplicons were sequenced on a Illumina GAIIx platform,
generating more than 1,000 short reads for each shRNA in the
library. After aligning short-read sequences to the known
sequence of shRNAs present in each pool, we used the frequency
of each short-read to estimate the frequency of shRNAs in each
surviving population. After data normalization to account for
variation between viral pools and replicas (see Supplementary
Materials and Methods), we identiﬁed shRNA constructs that
modulated the MCF7 response to olaparib by comparing the
abundance of shRNA-speciﬁc short-reads in olaparib and vehicle-treated cultures. Overrepresentation of shRNA sequence in
an olaparib-treated sample indicated a resistance-causing
effect, whereas underrepresentation indicated a sensitization
effect. These over- and underrepresentation effects were quantiﬁed as drug effect (DE) Z or standardized scores (See Supplementary Materials and Methods), with negative DE scores
indicating sensitization effects and positive DE scores indicating resistance-causing effects (Fig. 1A–C). In total, we conducted 2 biologic replicas of the screen and calculated average
DE scores for each shRNA from the replica data (Fig. 1A).
We calculated DE Z score values using the median absolute
deviation (MAD) and deﬁned sensitization effects as those
shRNAs that gave DE Z scores <1.96, a threshold approximately equivalent to P < 0.05 and likewise resistant effects as
those shRNAs that gave Z score >1.96 (Fig. 1B, Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). In total, we identiﬁed 2,339 shRNA constructs targeting 2,208 different genes causing an enhancement
of olaparib sensitivity in MCF7 cells and 2,043 shRNA constructs targeting 1,902 genes causing an increase in olaparib
resistance. We found that of 2,208 different genes appearing in
the candidate sensitivity list, the well-established PARP1/2
inhibitor sensitivity gene BRCA1 (9 shRNAs with DE Z score
<1.96) and the ATAD5 gene (ATPase family, AAA domain
containing 5, 4 shRNAs with DE Z score <1.96), were represented by more than 2 shRNAs with DE Z scores <1.96.
ATAD5 is known to modulate proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) deubiquitination and genomic stability (16–18), and
we found that silencing of ATAD5 enhanced olaparib sensitivity
and reduced RAD51 foci formation (a major determinant of
PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity; Supplementary Fig. S2), giving us
some conﬁdence in the results of the screen. Five percent of the
genes (119 genes) in the candidate sensitivity list were represented by two shRNAs with DE <1.96, whereas the vast
majority of genes in the sensitivity list were represented by
one shRNA with DE <1.96 (2,089 genes, 95%). Similarly, in the
candidate resistance-causing gene list, there were 141 genes
represented by 2 shRNAs (7%) and 1,761 genes (93%) represented by one shRNA. From our experience with this shRNA
library (19, 20), the predominance of hits represented by only

www.aacrjournals.org

one shRNA is common and explains the rationale behind
efforts that many have made to increase the number of shRNA
species per gene in newer-generation shRNA libraries (21).
Using pathway annotation tools such as KEGG and literature sources, we annotated the list of candidate "hit" genes to
identify the predominant known molecular networks explaining the response to olaparib. To facilitate network analysis, we
annotated all genes in which at least one shRNA caused either
sensitivity or resistance as deﬁned above. In the case of the
olaparib sensitivity-causing effects, the 2 most predominant
networks represented were DNA repair processes and DNA
cohesion/chromatin remodeling. For example, we found evidence for an involvement in DNA repair for at least 74 genes in
the candidate sensitivity-causing gene list (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S4). Of these, 65% (48
genes) have already been implicated in either BRCA1 function,
DNA double-stand break repair, the Fanconi's anemia pathway, or HR (Fig. 1D and E, Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore, 14 genes in the candidate
sensitivity gene list have previously been reported as modulating PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity (BRCA1, NBN, FANCD2,
FANCC, RAD51, MCM3, CDK7, GTF2H3, LIG3, POLH, PTEN,
USP1, RAD51D, and RAD51C; Supplementary Table S4;
refs. 6, 8, 22–25). The identiﬁcation of a series of HR genes
and known PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitization effects in our
candidate hit list gave us considerable conﬁdence in the screen
data and supports the hypothesis that HR is a key determinant
of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity. However, we did note that
some critical HR genes were not present in our candidate hit
list, such as BRCA2 and DSS1; it seems possible that the shRNA
constructs for these genes do not cause a level of gene silencing
sufﬁcient to elicit HR deﬁciency, reinforcing the idea that the
negative predictive value of such screens (i.e., the ability to
identify genes that do not cause the phenotype of interest)
might be limited.
We also noted that a number of cohesins, chromatin remodeling proteins, and replication-associated genes that are
involved in DNA repair were found in our candidate sensitization gene list (e.g., the cohesion-associated genes, RAD21,
ESCO1, ESCO2, and SMC3; the MCM protein-coding genes
MCM2, 3, and 6; and the topoisomerase-coding genes TOP3A
and TOP2B; Fig. 1F; Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S3) highlighting the potential impact of sister chromatid cohesion and chromatin remodeling in the response to
PARP1/2 inhibitor–induced lesions. This latter observation is
consistent with work identifying cohesins and associated proteins as being critical to the DDR (10, 26). In addition, a number
of other DNA repair proteins not so far linked to HR were also
identiﬁed in the candidate sensitization gene list, including
those involved in base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide
excision repair (NER; Supplementary Table S4), such as LIG3
and POLB (for the purposes of classiﬁcation, deﬁned as BER
proteins; ref. 27) and GTF2H3 and CDK7 (both NER). Of these,
LIG3, GTF2H3, and CDK7 have previously been implicated in
PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity (23). The identiﬁcation of multiple
components of DDR not implicated in HR in the candidate gene
list here suggests that the response to PARP1/2 inhibitor–driven
DNA lesions is perhaps more complex.

Among the olaparib resistance-causing effects, we noted
that 2 shRNAs targeting the olaparib target PARP1 caused
olaparib resistance with DE Z scores of 2.0 and 3.4 (Supplementary Table S3). This observation is consistent with recent
work identifying PARP1 deﬁciency as a cause of PARP inhibitor
resistance in cells with functional HR (28, 29). It is suggested
that the cytotoxic DNA lesions in cells exposed to PARP1/2
inhibitors are trapped PARP1–DNA complexes (28). These
lesions most likely form as catalytic PARP inhibitors reduce
PARP1 autoPARylation, an event that is normally required for
the release of PARP1 from DNA. In the absence of PARP1, these
DNA lesions do not form and the cytotoxicity normally caused
by PARP1/2 inhibitors is reduced (28, 29).
Integration of the olaparib sensitization proﬁle with
tumor mutation data
One of our aims in this study was to identify genetic
biomarkers that could be used to inform the clinical use of
PARP1/2 inhibitors. Already, a number of cancer-associated
mutations predict sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibitors, such as
loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. To identify
other loss-of-function cancer mutations that could predict
sensitivity to olaparib, we integrated our list of candidate
shRNA sensitivity effects with publically available data describing somatic and germline mutations in a range of cancer
histologies (30–32). As predicted, this analysis highlighted the
presence of recurrent cancer-associated mutations in known
olaparib sensitization genes identiﬁed in our shRNA screen
such as BRCA1, ATM, FANCD2, FANCE, and PTEN. CDK12
(ENSG00000167258, also known as CRK7, CRKR, CRKRS), a
gene represented in the olaparib shRNA sensitization list (DE
¼ 4.3; Supplementary Table S2) was identiﬁed as 1 of only
9 genes found to be signiﬁcantly mutated in HGS-OVCa (13). In
a recent genomic analysis of 316 HGS-OV tumors, 9 tumors
were found to have somatic CDK12 mutations (3%); in the same

dataset, BRCA1 and BRCA2 were found to be mutated in 12%
(BRCA1) and 11% (BRCA2) of tumors (13). Five of the CDK12
mutations in HGS-OVCa were nonsense or insertion/deletion
mutations likely to be loss-of-function mutations (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Table S5). Furthermore, as Spellman and colleagues noted, the additional 4 missense CDK12 mutations
identiﬁed in HGS-OVCa clustered in the protein kinase coding
domain of CDK12, suggesting that they could compromise
kinase activity (13). A subsequent analysis of the variant allele
frequency of CDK12 mutations in HGS-OVCa has also suggested that loss of the wild-type CDK12 allele occurs in the
majority of CDK12-mutant tumors, further arguing the case for
CDK12 as an HGS-OVCa tumor suppressor gene (33). By
analyzing data from the TCGA study describing the mutational
spectrum of HGS-OVCa (13), we found that 95% of tumor
BRCA1 mutations (36 of 38 cases) were mutually exclusive with
mutations in BRCA2, an expected observation given the
involvement of these 2 genes in a common pathway (HR;
ref. 13). We also found that the majority of tumor CDK12
mutations in this same data set (78%, 7 of 9 cases) were
mutually exclusive with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2
(Fig. 2B). Although the mutual exclusivity relationships
between BRCA1, BRCA2, and CDK12 mutations were not
complete (i.e., 100%), the distribution of mutations in these
3 genes across the TCGA dataset may represent an alternative
means to confer the same phenotype, suggesting epistasis or a
common pathway being compromised.
CDK12 and PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity
The appearance of CDK12 in our olaparib sensitization gene
list, alongside the CDK12 mutational data, suggested the
possibility that loss of CDK12 function could sensitize tumor
cells to PARP1/2 inhibitors and that loss of CDK12 function in
HGS-OVCa could be a predictive biomarker for response to this
developmental class of agents.

tumor cell models. PEO1 cell line was excluded from this analysis on account of
its BRCA2 mutation. CDK12 mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly lower in the
sensitive cohort (P < 0.05, Student t test).

To test this, we ﬁrst assessed the olaparib sensitivity of a
panel of HGS-OVCa cell line models using the gold-standard
clonogenic assay format, exposing cells to olaparib for 2 weeks.
This analysis showed a gradation of response from the sensitive
PEO1 (hemizygous BRCA2 p.Y1655X mutant; ref. 34) model
through to the resistant SKOV3 cell line (Fig. 3A and Table 1).
Next generation sequencing of most of these models has not
identiﬁed CDK12 mutations (35), however, by carrying out RTPCR and Western blot analysis of CDK12 across the tumor cell
line panel (Fig. 3B and C), we found a signiﬁcant correlation
between reduced CDK12 expression and olaparib sensitivity
(Fig. 3B and D, P < 0.05; Student t test).
To directly assess the relationship between CDK12 deﬁciency and PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity, we silenced CDK12

cell line and assessed olaparib sensitivity. Three different
CDK12 shRNA constructs caused partial silencing of CDK12
(Fig. 4A and B) and a modest yet signiﬁcant increase in
olaparib sensitivity (Fig. 4C, P < 0.05, ANOVA), at a scale
equivalent to that achieved by a shRNA construct targeting
BRCA1. In addition, an siRNA targeting CDK12 also sensitized OV90 cells to olaparib (Fig. 4D, P < 0.001, ANOVA).
shRNA targeting CDK12 also sensitized an additional HGSOVCa model, PEO14, to olaparib (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B, P < 0.05, ANOVA), suggesting the generality of this
effect. We analyzed whether restoring CDK12 expression
could confer PARP1/2 inhibitor resistance in a tumor cell
line with low levels of endogenous CDK12 expression, such
as CAOV3. Ectopic expression of CDK12 signiﬁcantly
restored olaparib resistance [Supplementary Fig. S4C, P <

We also assessed the hypothesis that the relationship
between CDK12 dysfunction and PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity
could be explained by a reduction of HR, the predominant
pathway identiﬁed in our PARP1/2 inhibitor synthetic lethality
screen (Supplementary Fig. S3). To assess this, we measured
HR activity using a synthetic DNA HR substrate (DR-GFP) that
generates a GFP signal once an experimentally induced DNA
double-strand break (DSB) has been repaired by HR (11, 12).
HeLa cells harboring the DR-GFP reporter system were
reverse-transfected with siRNA targeting CDK12, BRCA1, or
BRCA2 and 24 hours later, a single DSB was introduced in the
synthetic DNA substrate via the expression of the I-Sce1
restriction endonuclease (11). CDK12 silencing caused a 70%
reduction in HR, a level of suppression similar to that caused by
siRNA targeting BRCA1 or BRCA2 (Fig. 5A, P < 0.0001, Student t
test). We also assessed another marker of HR, the ability to
form nuclear RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage (5).
Silencing of CDK12 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in
ionizing radiation–induced RAD51 foci formation, when compared with control-treated cells (Fig. 5B and C, P < 0.001,
Student t test), an observation consistent with the DR-GFP

CDK12 and PARP Inhibitor Sensitivity

sensitivity to chemotherapies that stall replication forks such
as mitomycin C and camptothecin (36). We found that CDK12
silencing in 2 HGS-OVCa models also caused sensitivity to the
replication fork stalling agent cisplatin (P < 0.001, ANOVA for
each CDK12 shRNA vs. shNTC; Supplementary Fig. S4E and
S4F). In the ﬁrst instance, we tested whether mRNA transcript
levels of BRCA1, FANCD2, ATR, and FANCI were regulated by
CDK12 in HGS-OVCa cells infected with CDK12 shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S5A). We noted that levels of BRCA1 mRNA
and protein were reduced by 2 different CDK12 shRNA expression constructs, whereas levels of other DNA repair proteins,
such as ATR, were not (Fig. 5D and E and Supplementary Fig.
S5A and B, P < 0.05, Student t test). The suppression of this key
HR gene (BRCA1) provides a possible mechanistic explanation
for the HR dysfunction and PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity seen
in CDK12-defective cells. As HR and PARP1/2 inhibitor resistance can be restored in BRCA1-deﬁcient cells by loss of 53BP1
activity (37–39) and BRCA1 levels were reduced by CDK12
suppression (Fig. 5D and E), we tested the possibility that
inhibition of 53BP1 could also restore PARP1/2 inhibitor
resistance in the absence of CDK12 expression. Gene silencing
of 53BP1 in combination with silencing of CDK12 (Supplementary Fig. S5C) caused a modest increase in olaparib resistance (Fig. 5F, P < 0.0001, Student t test), consistent with the
hypothesis that the loss of BRCA1 expression could play some
role in mediating PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity in HGS-OVCa
tumor cells with low CDK12. CCNK (also known as cyclin K) is
the cyclin partner of CDK12 and regulates CDK12 expression
(36). Using a previously validated RNA interference reagent for
CCNK (36), we established that targeting of CCNK also caused
olaparib and cisplatin sensitization in a HGS-OVCa model, at a
scale equivalent to that achieved by CDK12 silencing (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B).
Given the data suggesting the role of CDK12 in HR, we
sought to determine whether the extent of tumor CDK12
mRNA expression correlated with response to platinum therapy. Using survival data from patients treated with platinum
therapy in the recent TCGA study, in which corresponding
tumor mRNA levels were also quantiﬁed (13), we found that the
patients with the lowest levels of tumor CDK12 mRNA expression had improved OS compared with those with elevated
levels of CDK12 mRNA [Fig. 6A, P ¼ 0.0076 (log-rank test), HR ¼
0.55; and Fig. 6B, P ¼ 0.0375 (Student t test)]. Of note, the
patients with tumor CDK12 mutations predicted to be most
deleterious to CDK12 function (i.e., truncating mutations such
p.L122fs, p.Q602 , p.W719 , and p.L926fs) fell into the CDK12
"low" cohort in this analysis.
On the basis of this preliminary clinical data, we assessed the
therapeutic effect of olaparib on CDK12-deﬁcient tumor cells
in vivo. OV90 cells stably expressing a CDK12 shRNA expression
construct (shCDK12þ) or a control, nontargeting (shNTCþ)
shRNA construct were subcutaneously xenografted into female
athymic nude mice. Once tumors had established and were
measurable, mice were randomized into 1 of 4 treatment
groups: (i) an shCDK12þ OV90 xenograft-bearing cohort treated with vehicle, (ii) an shCDK12þ OV90 xenograft-bearing
cohort treated with olaparib, (iii) an shNTCþ OV90 xenograftbearing cohort treated with vehicle, and (iv) an shNTCþ OV90

xenograft-bearing cohort treated with olaparib. There was a
clear and statistically signiﬁcant inhibitory effect of olaparib on
tumor volume in shCDK12þ tumor xenografts compared with
the other cohorts (Fig. 6C and D, P < 0.001, ANOVA for the
shCDK12þ olaparib-treated cohort vs. each other cohort; all
other comparisons returned a nonsigniﬁcant P value). The
treatment regime was well-tolerated, with none of the mice
showing a signiﬁcant change in body weight (Supplementary
Fig. S6).

Discussion
As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne on a
genome-wide scale the compendium of genes that controls the
cellular response to a clinical PARP1/2 inhibitor. The initial
analysis of this data conﬁrms that the status of the DDR
apparatus and particularly, HR is a key factor in determining
the cytotoxicity of olaparib. Furthermore, genes that control
chromatin remodeling and sister chromatid cohesion, perhaps
as part of the DDR, also seem to modulate the response to
olaparib. Subsequent interrogation of the compendium of
candidate PARP1/2 inhibitor genes generated in this study
could in future identify additional molecular networks that
explain how cells respond to these drugs.
One of the major issues in the clinical development of PARP1/
2 inhibitors is the identiﬁcation of biomarkers other than BRCA1
and BRCA2 gene mutations that predict a favorable response to
therapy. For example, phase 1 and 2 studies established that
olaparib could be administered safely and that it showed
signiﬁcant responses in germline BRCA mutation carriers with
breast, ovarian, or prostate tumors. However, not all trials have
been so positive; efforts to target patient subgroups without
germline BRCA mutations, but which might have similar HR
defects such as triple-negative breast cancers, have not met with
similar success (40). Similarly, the mixed responses to olaparib
in patients with HGS-OVCa (4), a patient subgroup selected for
trial because of its presumed high frequency of tumor-speciﬁc
HR defects, argues the case for the identiﬁcation of additional
biomarkers that could be used to direct the use of PARP1/2
inhibitors. We propose that CDK12 should be considered as a
candidate PARP1/2 inhibitor response biomarker and assessed
in additional patient material from existing PARP1/2 inhibitor
trials and integrated into the design of future trials, especially
given its recurrent mutation in HGS-OVCa.
One future use of the compendium of genes described here is
in the development of metagenes that predict the response to
therapy. For example, we, and others, have previously shown
that aggregate measures of gene expression from groups or
modules of genes (metagenes) identiﬁed in functional proﬁling
studies can correlate with patient responses (19). Once the full
panoply of genomic and transcriptomic proﬁling of tumors from
patients on PARP1/2 inhibitor trials becomes available, such
analyses may become possible. Of course, such an approach
should take into account the limitations of such in vitro genetic
screens. In this particular case, we note that the screen was
carried out in one tumor cell model and that cellular responses
(and the genes that control these responses) may differ from cell
line to cell line. Furthermore, the shRNA library used here could
be improved by increasing the number of different shRNA
