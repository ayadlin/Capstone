Abstract
Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer. There is a
lack of effective treatments for individuals with advanced
disease. Many melanomas exhibit high levels of radioresistance. The direct consequence of ;-irradiation for most
melanoma cells is growth arrest at the G2-M phase of cell
cycle. However, radiation-induced signaling pathways may
affect numerous additional targets in cancer cells. We show in
the present study that ;-irradiation, as well as A-particle
exposure, dramatically increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to recombinant tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis via
up-regulation of surface TRAIL-receptor 1/receptor 2 (DR4/
DR5) levels and to Fas ligand–mediated apoptosis via upregulation of surface Fas levels. Additionally, increased
dynamin-2 expression after irradiation is critically important
in the translocation of death receptor to the cell surface.
Moreover, sodium arsenite treatment may up-regulate expression of endogenous TRAIL and induces its translocation to
cell surface and further down-regulates cFLIP levels in
melanoma cells. We have evaluated the effects of sequential
;-irradiation and arsenite treatment of melanoma cells for the
induction of death signaling. Such treatment results in an
efficient TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via a paracrine mechanism. These data highlight the efficacy of combined modality
treatment involving radiation and arsenite in clinical management of this often fatal form of skin cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The incidence of melanoma has substantially increased worldwide over the last 40 years. Although melanoma accounts for only
10% of skin cancer, it is responsible for at least 80% of skin cancer
death. Approximately 8,000 Americans died of melanoma in 2005
and 62,200 new cases of melanoma have been diagnosed in 2006.
Most advanced melanomas respond poorly to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy and no effective therapy exists to inhibit the
metastatic spread of this cancer (1, 2).
The tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) has a strong antitumor potential by inducing apoptosis in
a wide variety of human TRAIL-receptor 1–positive (TRAIL-R1/

DR4) and TRAIL-receptor 2–positive (TRAIL-R2/DR5) cancer cells
but not in most normal human cells that often contain high levels
of decoy receptors TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 on cell surface, thereby
preventing induction of apoptotic signaling (3, 4). However, many
metastatic tumors, including advanced melanomas, acquired the
secondary resistance to apoptotic signaling induced by TRAIL.
Actually, f60% of tumor cell lines are resistant to TRAIL (5, 6). In
an addition to the presence of decoy receptors, such resistance
may occur at different points of the TRAIL-induced death signaling
pathway. Suppression of surface expression of the death receptors
(TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5), dysfunction of death receptors due to mutations, suppression of caspase-8 or caspase-3 functions, and overexpression of endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis,
such as cFLIP, cIAP, XIAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, directly correlate with
resistance to TRAIL in many types of cancer, including melanomas
(7). There is evidence that progression in melanoma is often linked
with decreased surface expression of TRAIL-R1/R2. Furthermore,
general activations of the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, and Ras-BRAF-mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase-ERK signaling pathways, which are characteristic features of
advanced tumors (8, 9), often result in protection against TRAILmediated apoptosis via up-regulation of gene expression of antiapoptotic proteins (10, 11).
The direct consequences of g-irradiation of cancer cells are
either growth arrest due to activation of specific signaling pathways following DNA damage or radiation-induced cell death via
apoptosis or necrosis. Radiation-induced apoptotic signaling could
use both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways (12).
Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality for cancer
(f50% of all types of cancer). However, it is not effective for
treatment of melanomas, which are largely radioresistant. On the
other hand, rationally designed combined treatment, including
g-irradiation and chemotherapy or biochemotherapy, which simultaneously targets several critical functions of cancer cells, may be
effective in some cancer treatments (13).
In the present study, we address the question of whether it would
be possible to increase surface expression of death receptors and to
suppress, simultaneously, antiapoptotic functions in melanoma
cells to effectively induce the death signaling cascade. The results
obtained show that sequential treatment of melanoma cells with
g-irradiation or a-particle irradiation and recombinant TRAIL may
substantially increase apoptotic response of TRAIL-resistant
melanoma cells. Furthermore, many types of cancer cells, including
melanomas, contain intracellular pools of Fas ligand (FasL), TRAIL,
or both that could be translocated to cell surface following stress
signaling (14, 15). We have previously used sodium arsenite as a
stress inducer for initiation of the endogenous TRAIL translocation
to cell surface (16). As a consequence, such combined treatment of

melanoma cells with g-radiation and sodium arsenite efficiently
induces apoptotic signaling via paracrine TRAIL/TRAIL-receptor
mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Sodium arsenite and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma.
Human soluble FasL (recombinant) and soluble Killer-TRAIL (recombinant)
were purchased from Alexis. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor
SP600125 was obtained from Biomol; MEK inhibitor U0126 and PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. Caspase inhibitors
zVAD-fmk, Ac-IETD-CHO (an inhibitor of caspase-8 and caspase-6), and
Ac-LEHD-CHO (an inhibitor of caspase-9) were purchased from Calbiochem.
Cell lines. Human melanoma cell lines LU1205 (also known as 1205lu),
WM9, and WM35 (17) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotics.
Irradiation procedures. 3He a-particles (125 keV/Am) were delivered to
the melanoma cells using 4-MV Van de Graff accelerator at the Radiological
Research Accelerator Facilities of Columbia University. Control and irradiated cells were collected 24 h after irradiation. Cultures were trypsinized
and counted with a Coulter counter, and aliquots of the cells were replated
into 100-mm-diameter dishes for colony formation or flow cytometry assay.
Cultures for clonogenic survival assays were incubated for 12 days, at which
time they were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa.
To determine sensitivity to g-rays, the plates with melanoma cells were
exposed to radiation from a GammaCell 40 137Cs irradiator (dose rate, 0.82
Gy/min) of Columbia University. Six to 24 h after irradiation, cells have been
used for flow cytometry or for additional treatments.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of TRAIL, TRAIL-R1/R2
(DR4/DR5), and Fas levels. Surface levels of TRAIL on human melanomas
were determined by staining with the phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antihuman TRAIL monoclonal antibody (mAb; eBioscience) and subsequent
flow cytometry. Surface levels of TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5, and Fas
were determined by staining with the PE-labeled mAbs from eBioscience
and BD Biosciences PharMingen. PE-conjugated nonspecific mouse IgG1
was used as an immunoglobulin isotype control. A FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) combined with the CellQuest program was
used to do flow cytometric analysis. All experiments were independently
repeated four to five times.
Transfection and luciferase assay. The NF-nB luciferase reporter
containing two nB-binding sites, Jun2-Luc reporter and empty vector tk-Luc
(18), and GAS-Luc reporter containing three repeats of GAS sites from the
Ly6A/E promoter were used to determine NF-nB, activator protein-1 (AP-1),
and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) transactivation, respectively. Additional reporter constructs used included the
following: 2.5-kb p21-WAF1-promoter-Luc (19), 1.5-kb TRAIL-promoter-Luc
(20), 1.8-kb DR4/TRAIL-R1-promoter-Luc (21), DR5/TRAIL-R2-full-Luc,
which contained 1.6 kb upstream of the ATG site through intron 2 in the
DR5 genomic locus (22), and 1-kb cFLIP-promoter-Luc (23, 24). Transient
transfection of different reporter constructs (1 Ag) together with pCMV-hgal
(0.25 Ag) into 5  105 melanoma cells was done using LipofectAMINE (Life
Technologies-Invitrogen). Proteins were prepared for h-galactosidase and
luciferase analysis 16 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was
determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized
based on h-galactosidase levels.
In some experiments, melanoma cells were transfected with reporter
constructs together with certain expression vectors (ratio, 1:3), including the
following: pCMV-InBaDN (25), pcDNA3-IKKhS178E/S181E (26), DMEKK1
expression vector (27), pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK7h1 (28), dominant-negative
JNK1-APF, and dominant-negative form of cJun/TAM67 in the presence of
pCMV-hgal. Sixteen to 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity was
determined.
Apoptosis studies. Cells were exposed to soluble TRAIL (50 ng/mL), alone
or in combination with cycloheximide (2 Ag/mL), to soluble FasL (50 ng/mL)
and sodium arsenite (5 Amol/L). Apoptosis was then assessed by quantifying
the percentage of hypodiploid nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation. Flow
cytometric analysis was done on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.

cFLIP suppression by RNA interference. The pSUPER retro RNA
interference (RNAi) system (OligoEngine), which has been used for the
production of small RNAi transcripts, was used to suppress cFLIP
expression. Two variants of RNAi of 19 nucleotides designed to target
human cFLIP were expressed using vector pSUPER.retro.puro (pSR-puro).
RNAi cFLIP-92 (UGUGGUUCCACCUAAUGUC) was the most efficient in the
corresponding mRNA targeting.
Western blot analysis. Total cell lysates (50 Ag protein) were resolved
on 10% SDS-PAGE and processed according to standard protocols. The
antibodies used for Western blotting included the following: monoclonal
anti-h-actin (Sigma); monoclonal anti-FLIP (NF6; Axxora); monoclonal
anti-XIAP (BD Biosciences); monoclonal anti-cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2;
Cayman Chemical Co.); monoclonal anti-p21-WAF1 (Cell Signaling);
monoclonal anti-dynamin-2 (Upstate); polyclonal antibodies to TRAIL
(human); TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5 (Axxora); polyclonal anti-Fas
(BD Biosciences PharMingen); and polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p53 (Ser20) and total p53, phosphorylated stress-activated protein
kinase/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and JNK, phosphorylated p44/p42 MAPK
(Thr202/Tyr204) and p44/p42 MAPK, and phosphorylated AKT (Ser473) and
AKT (Cell Signaling). Optimal dilutions of primary antibodies were 1:1,000
to 1:5,000. The secondary antibodies anti-mouse or anti-rabbit were
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (dilution, 1:5,000 to 1:10,000); signals
were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) was done for the detection of NF-nB DNA-binding activity as
previously described using the labeled double-strand oligonucleotide
AGCTTGGGGACTTTCC AGCCG (binding site is italicized). Ubiquitous
NF-Y DNA-binding activity was used as an internal control (29).

Results
TRAIL- and radiation-induced cell death in human melanoma lines. Human melanoma cell lines showed different levels of
sensitivity to soluble recombinant TRAIL (30). Based on our
previous results, we selected two contrasting human metastatic
melanoma lines: WM9 that was highly sensitive to TRAIL and
LU1205 (also known as 1205lu) that was relatively resistant to
TRAIL (Fig. 1A). Both melanoma lines express TRAIL-R2/DR5 on
cell surface, although levels of surface expression of TRAIL-R2/DR5
are f2-fold higher in WM9 cells (Fig. 1B). Modest and low levels
of expression of TRAIL-R1/DR4 have also been detected on the
surface of WM9 and LU1205 cells, respectively. We showed
previously that another important difference between WM9 and
LU1205 cells was linked to the levels of antiapoptotic cFLIP
protein, which have been significantly diminished in WM9 cells
(16). In addition, we used early (radial growth phase) WM35
melanoma cells, which express relatively low levels of DR5 on cell
surface and show only a modest response to either TRAIL alone or
in combination with cycloheximide (Fig. 1A and B).
Cycloheximide (2 Ag/mL) notably increased TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in LU1205 cells 48 h after treatment. However, apoptotic
levels obtained were still lower compared with levels induced by
soluble TRAIL alone in WM9 cells. An additional increase in TRAILmediated apoptosis could be obtained by suppression of the PI3K-AKT
pathway, the main regulator of general cell survival, with a specific
pharmacologic inhibitor LY294002 (50 Amol/L), or by suppression of
the MEK-ERK pathway with the inhibitor U0126 (10 Amol/L; Fig. 1A).
TRAIL-induced apoptosis of WM9 and LU1205 cells is sensitive to both
caspase-8 and caspase-9 inhibitors (16), which indicates an involvement of mitochondrial apoptotic loop in the acceleration of TRAILinduced apoptosis in these melanoma cells.
On the other hand, WM9 and LU1205 metastatic cell lines
exhibited different degrees of radiosensitivity. In WM9 cells, a
modest apoptosis, which was accompanied by the secondary

necrosis, was detected 48 h after g-irradiation (2.5–5 Gy). In
contrast, LU1205 cells showed a pronounced G2-M arrest under
these conditions (Fig. 1C) as was previously reported for this melanoma line (31). Radiation-induced death of WM9 cells accompanied by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1C) was, however, insensitive to
caspase inhibitors (Fig. 1D) or to anti-TRAIL inhibitory mAb (data
not shown). As expected, LY294002 (50 Amol/L) and U0126
(10 Amol/L) additionally increased the level of radiation-induced
death in WM9 cells (Fig. 1C and D). In contrast to WM9 cells,
the effect of LY294002 (50 Amol/L) on radiosensitivity of LU1205
cells was less pronounced, inducing low-level apoptosis and a
release from G2-M arrest (Fig. 1C). WM35 early melanoma cells
also exhibited radioresistance similarly to LU1205 cells (data not
shown). Analysis of clonogenic survival of cancer cells after
g-irradiation confirmed a higher degree of radiosensitivity of
WM9 compared with LU1205 cells (data not shown). Differential
response to g-irradiation, however, was not connected with the
p53 status that was wild-type for both melanoma lines (31).
Effects of ;-irradiation on cell signaling and surface
expression of death receptors. In spite of the absence of pronounced apoptotic response, g-irradiation of LU1205 melanoma
cells affected many signaling pathways that activated stressinduced transcription factors, such as NF-nB and p53 and their
target genes. We initially observed up-regulation of nuclear NF-nB
DNA-binding activity determined by EMSA (Fig. 2A) and also
increased NF-nB–dependent reporter activity (Fig. 2C). We also
detected increased p53 and phosphorylated Ser20-p53 levels by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, up-regulation of the
p21-WAF1 promoter activity and general AP-1–dependent reporter
activities was also observed 6 h after irradiation (Fig. 2C).
Up-regulation of the wild-type p53 levels in both LU1205 and
WM9 lines correlated with an increase in the levels of its
downstream transcriptional targets, such as p21-WAF1, BAX, Fas,
and TRAIL-R2/DR5 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a rapid down-regulation
of an antiapoptotic protein cFLIP (both long and short forms) was
also observed in these conditions, reflecting negative regulation
of cFLIP expression and stability by JNK induced by g-irradiation
(Fig. 2B; refs. 16, 32).
Hence, irradiation of melanoma cells was accompanied by
notable up-regulation of the transcription and total protein levels
of death receptors, Fas, DR4, and DR5, which were regulated by p53
in concert with NF-nB, AP-1, and STAT (Fig. 2B and C; refs. 21, 22).
Furthermore, dynamin-2 level, a cytoskeleton protein previously
shown to control Fas receptor trafficking through trans-Golgi
network to cell surface (33, 34), substantially increased after girradiation (Fig. 2B). This suggested that the up-regulation of
surface expression of death receptors after irradiation of cancer
cells was attributable to increased efficiency of protein translocation in the cell. Indeed, 24 h after g-irradiation of LU1205 cells, a
profound increase in surface Fas levels and in TRAIL-R2/DR5
levels, as well as modest increase in TRAIL-R1/DR4 surface levels,
has been detected (Fig. 2D). Of note, dose-dependent increase
of surface expression was observed for Fas at 2.5 to 10 Gy and for
DR5 at 2.5 to 5 Gy, whereas DR4 levels increased relatively similarly
after irradiation with dose 2.5 to 5 Gy (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, girradiation (2.5–5 Gy) had also prominent effects in the upregulation of surface expression of Fas and DR5 in WM9 cells,
whereas only a modest effect was detected in early melanoma
WM35 cells (see Fig. 1B).
To determine a direct effect of g-irradiation on Fas translocation
in cells, LU1205 cells were transfected with fused Fas-green

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

fluorescent protein (GFP) construct (Fig. 2E; ref. 35). As expected,
surface expression of Fas-GFP, which was detected using PElabeled mAb to the Fas extracellular domain, was notably increased
(at least 2-fold) 6 h after irradiation based on an increase in
medium fluorescence intensity (MFI) from 210 to 460 and in
percentage cells with high levels of surface Fas.
Brefeldin A (100 ng/mL), an inhibitor of protein translocation
from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, also suppressed
endogenous surface expression of Fas and DR4/DR5 induced by
irradiation (data not shown). Taken together, these results show
that g-irradiation is involved not only in transcriptional control of
death receptor expression but also in regulation of their
translocation to cell surface.
Sequential treatment of melanoma cells with ;-irradiation
and recombinant TRAIL or FasL. Changes observed in death
receptor levels following g-irradiation have a functional significance. We have used soluble recombinant TRAIL (50 ng/mL)
combined with cycloheximide (2 Ag/mL) to induce apoptosis in
LU1205 cells 24 to 48 h after g-irradiation (Fig. 3A and B). Detailed
analysis showed a substantial increase in apoptotic levels ( from
25% to 48% after an additional 24 h and from 56% to 94% after an
additional 48 h of TRAIL treatment for melanoma cells), which
were preexposed with g-irradiation (Fig. 3A and B). Interestingly,
an additional suppression of basal levels of cFLIP (both long and
short forms) by specific RNAi (16) accelerated development of
apoptosis in preirradiated melanoma cells 24 h after treatment
with TRAIL and cycloheximide (48 h after g-irradiation; Fig. 3C
and D).
Taken together, these experiments indicated that up-regulation
of surface expression of death receptors and simultaneous downregulation of antiapoptotic cFLIP protein levels may substantially
increase susceptibility of resistant melanoma line to TRAILmediated apoptosis. Additionally, sequential treatment of irradiated LU1205 cells with recombinant FasL (50 ng/mL) in combination
with cycloheximide (2 Amol/L) also induced strong Fas-mediated
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner 24 and 48 h after treatment
(Fig. 3A, bottom).
Role of dynamin-2 in death receptor translocation. To
further confirm a probable role of dynamin-2 expression in regulation of death receptor translocation to cell surface in irradiated
cells, we took advantage of previously established LU1205 melanoma lines expressing dominant-negative dynamin-2 constructs:
Dyn-2K44A and Dyn-Y231F/Y597F (Dyn-2FF; ref. 33). Dominantnegative interference of dynamin-2 (36) that partially suppressed
death receptor protein translocation from trans-Golgi network
to cell surface (33, 37) caused dramatic down-regulation of
g-irradiation–induced levels of DR5 (after 2.5 Gy) and Fas (2.5 Gy)
in LU1205 cells 24 h after treatment (Fig. 4A and C). This was
followed by decreased levels of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cells
where dynamin-2 functions have been suppressed (Fig. 4B). We have
also observed similar effects for recombinant FasL-mediated
apoptosis in irradiated cells (Fig. 4D).
A-Particle irradiation of melanoma cells. An increased
effectiveness of a-particle irradiation versus g-irradiation has been
shown in numerous studies for both initial and delayed responses
to radiation, including development of apoptosis. Therefore,
a-particles are very promising tool for cancer therapy, especially
for isolated metastatic cells, as is observed in leukemia because of
their high linear energy transfer and short effective path length.
Our experiments showed that a-particle irradiation of melanoma
cells, similarly to g-irradiation, increased surface expression of

death receptors in a dose-dependent manner in both WM9
(Fig. 5A) and LU1205 cells (data not shown). Furthermore,
a combination of low-dose a-particle irradiation with decreased
concentrations of soluble TRAIL may also effectively induce
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in WM9 cells (Fig. 5B), providing
additional flexibility for rational treatment design. Indeed,
exposure of WM9 cells to a-particles (1 Gy) caused accelerating

apoptosis induced by lower doses of TRAIL (20 ng/mL instead
50 ng/mL; Fig. 5B).
As expected, a-particle irradiation by itself shows dosedependent effects on cancer cell survival 12 days after exposure
(Fig. 5C). Moreover, sequential treatment with low-dose a-particle
irradiation (0.5 Gy) and TRAIL (10–50 ng/mL) additionally
decreased cell survival and accelerated cancer cell death conditions

Dyn-2K44A and Dyn-2FF. Surface expression of DR5 and Fas was detected using the correspondent mAbs and FACS analysis 18 h after g-irradiation (2.5 Gy). B and D,
cells were sequentially g-irradiated (2.5 Gy) and, after 24 h, treated with TRAIL (50 ng/mL) + cycloheximide (2 Ag/mL) for an additional 24 h or with FasL (50 ng/mL) +
cycloheximide for an additional 24 h. Apoptosis levels were determined as percentage of cells with hypodiploid content of DNA in the pre-G0-G1 region using flow cytometry.

(Fig. 5D), which might substantially improve the effectiveness of
treatment.
Sodium arsenite treatment may partially substitute recombinant TRAIL. Both types of treatment (sodium arsenite and
g-irradiation) caused up-regulation of the TRAIL promoter activity
in melanomas (Fig. 6A). The TRAIL promoter contains binding
sites for transcription factors NF-nB, AP-1, and STAT (11, 38).
Permanently active MEKK1D, which activates both the NF-nB and
MAPK signaling pathways, strongly induced the TRAIL promoter
activity in transfected melanoma cells, whereas permanently active
IKKhS178E/S181E and MKK7-h1 (JNK kinase) showed average
induction of the TRAIL promoter activity (Fig. 6A). In contrast,
superstable inhibitor of NF-nB, InBaDN, dominant-negative JNK1APF, and dominant-negative form of cJun, TAM67, partially
suppressed the basal TRAIL promoter activity. Permanently active
AKTmyr, which inhibited JNK activity, also strongly blocked TRAIL
promoter activity (Fig. 6A).
Effects of MEKK1D and IKKh overexpression on NF-nB activity
and negative effects of AKT overexpression on JNK activity in
LU1205 cells have been described in our previous publications
(33, 39). Arsenite-induced or g-irradiation–induced TRAIL promoter activation is primarily mediated by JNK-cJun and could
be suppressed with pharmacologic inhibitor of JNK, SP600125
(10 Amol/L; Fig. 6A). The NF-nB signaling pathway seems to play an
additional role in the induction of TRAIL promoter only after
g-irradiation.
Our recent observations indicate that metastatic melanomas
contain a pool of intracellular TRAIL that could be transferred to
the cell surface following sodium arsenite treatment (16).
Interestingly, in contrast to arsenite, g-irradiation did not
efficiently induce TRAIL translocation to cell surface in melanomas
(Fig. 6C). Biochemical events in TRAIL translocation from
cytoplasm to the cell surface are still largely unknown.
Because sodium arsenite induced surface expression of endogenous TRAIL, we decided to use arsenite instead of soluble TRAIL
in a combined treatment with irradiation. We g-irradiated (5 Gy)
LU1205 and WM9 melanoma cells and observed increasing death
receptor surface expression, which was followed after 24 h by an
induction of surface expression of TRAIL using arsenite (5 Amol/L,
24 h; Fig. 6B and C). Furthermore, both types of treatment (arsenite
and g-irradiation) down-regulated cFLIP levels in LU1205 cells
(Fig. 2B; ref. 16). Therefore, we detected strong synergistic effects in
the development of apoptosis in melanoma lines LU1205 and WM9
after combined treatment (Fig. 6D). Introduction of anti-TRAIL
mAb (2 Ag/mL) in the cell medium partially protected melanoma
cells against apoptosis, further highlighting a role of TRAILmediated signaling in the development of apoptosis (Fig. 6D).
FasL-Fas pathway was only slightly involved in the mediation of
apoptosis after such combined treatment of melanomas because
arsenite was nonefficient inducer of FasL translocation (15).
A substantial proportion of TRAIL-independent apoptosis that
was observed in these conditions, however, indicated the multiple
effects of sodium arsenite in acceleration of apoptosis.
On the other hand, overactivation of AKT in LU1205 cells stably
transfected with AKTmyr (39) was accompanied by downregulation of basal DR5 surface levels and suppression of an
inducible increase in these levels after irradiation and arsenite
treatment. AKT overexpression also partially suppressed an
induction of surface expression of TRAIL following treatment of
melanoma cells with arsenite (data not shown). Finally, it resulted
in partial suppression of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in melanoma

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

cells on these conditions. Taken together, the results of our study
show that sequential treatment of melanoma cells with g-radiation
( for increasing DR5 surface levels) and sodium arsenite ( for
induction of endogenous TRAIL translocation to the cell surface
and suppression of cFLIP) efficiently induces apoptotic signaling
probably via paracrine TRAIL/TRAIL-receptor mechanisms. The
activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway may suppress the development
of apoptotic signaling in these conditions at the multiple levels.

Discussion
The resistance to TRAIL- or FasL-mediated apoptosis in cancer
cells remains a critical problem for the successful application of
recombinant TRAIL and FasL in anticancer therapy (40). The
strong toxicity of soluble FasL or agonistic anti-Fas mAbs rendered
Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling ineffective for in vivo applications. In contrast, soluble recombinant TRAIL/APO2-L was
substantially less toxic after systemic treatment as shown in
numerous experiments with different types of tumors in vivo (41),
although distinct recombinant versions of TRAIL showed differential hepatotoxicity (42).
Resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL can occur at different steps
in the death signaling pathways. However, decreased levels of
surface expression of death receptors and simultaneous overexpression of inhibitors of apoptosis, such as cFLIP or XIAP, seem
to be the most frequent events (13). On the other hand,
radiotherapy is widely used for cancer treatment, but the resistance
to radiation is a serious problem for melanoma treatment. Our
attempts to increase radiation-induced death of melanoma cells via
silencing COX-2 were unsuccessful due to strong up-regulation of
p21-WAF1 levels and dramatic increase in the level of G2-M arrest
in melanoma cells that competed with induction of cell death
pathway. Recent studies done on other cancer cell lines also
showed negative effects of p21 on irradiation-induced apoptosis
(43). However, in this case, the main target was cyclin-dependent
kinase–mediated caspase-9 activation that does not occur in our
cell lines after g-irradiation that shows caspase independence.
Additional effects of a-particle irradiation and g-irradiation (that
were complementary to direct induction of cell death) have been
observed in the present study, such as a strong up-regulation of
surface expression of death receptors, Fas and DR5, and downregulation of an antiapoptotic protein cFLIP in melanoma cells.
Some of these effects have been previously shown for prostate cancer
cells (44) and leukemic cells (45). In the absence of death ligands,
irradiation often did not induce a rapid apoptotic signaling, leaving
cells arrested at the G2-M phase that may result in slow necrotic
death. However, subsequent treatment of irradiated cells with recombinant TRAIL was very effective in the initiation of melanoma
cell apoptosis similar to previous finding in prostate cancer cells (44).
It is well known that g-irradiation can affect transcriptional
activity of the promoters of death receptor genes, especially DR5
and Fas, via p53 and NF-nB activation (22, 46). JNK, however,
plays opposite roles in the regulation of Fas and DR5 promoter
activities, with JNK-cJun as a negative regulator of the Fas promoter (39) and JNK-SP1 as a positive regulator of the DR5 promoter (47). In contrast, PI3K-AKT pathway that suppresses JNK
and STAT3 up-regulates Fas gene expression and translocation (39)
but has negative effects on DR5 expression and subsequent TRAILmediated apoptosis as we observed in the present study.
The post-translational levels of the death receptor expression,
including translocation of receptor precursors in the cell, have not

(IR; 5 Gy), sodium arsenite (As; 5 Amol/L), and SP600125 (10 Amol/L). Normalized luciferase activity was determined after an additional 6 h. B, LU1205 cells were
g-irradiated (5 Gy). Twenty-four hours after, cells were additionally treated with sodium arsenite (5 Amol/L, 8 h). Surface expression of Fas and DR5 was determined
by staining with PE-labeled anti-Fas and anti-DR5 mAbs, respectively, and FACS analysis. C, sodium arsenite (5 Amol/L, 8 h) induced TRAIL translocation to cell surface
in melanoma cells. Cells were treated by g-irradiation (5 Gy) or by sodium arsenite alone (5 Amol/L, 8 h) or in combination with g-irradiation (5 Gy). Surface levels of
TRAIL were determined by FACS analysis using anti-TRAIL-PE mAb. D, WM9 and LU1205 cells were g-irradiated (5 Gy). Twenty-four hours after, cells were treated with
sodium arsenite (5 Amol/L) in the presence or absence of indicated mAbs (2 Ag/mL). Melanoma cells stably transfected with AKTmyr were also used. Apoptosis levels
were determined after an additional 24 h as percentage of cells with hypodiploid content of DNA in the pre-G0-G1 region using flow cytometry. Columns, mean of three

been well studied. The present study further shows a role of
dynamin-2, a large GTFase that supports vesicle trafficking, in the
regulation of death receptor translocation not only for Fas receptor
(33) but also for DR5. Treatment by g-radiation is linked with
substantial up-regulation of dynamin-2 levels in the cell (48) that
probably facilitates protein transport from trans-Golgi network to
cell surface and results in efficient up-regulation of surface
expression of death receptors.
An important feature of many cancer cells, including advanced
melanomas, is the presence of the intracellular pools of TRAIL (16)
or FasL (14) that could be expressed on cell surface at the specific

circumstances (e.g., under stress conditions). An implication of
expression of death ligands by cancer cells and their probable role
in tumor counterattack is still subject of numerous investigations
(42). Based on our recent study (16), we have used a treatment with
sodium arsenite that may induce translocation of endogenous
TRAIL to cell surface with simultaneous strong down-regulation of
cFLIP antiapoptotic protein levels. In the present study, such
sequential treatment of melanoma cells with g-irradiation and
sodium arsenite resulted in an induction of apoptosis, which is
partially mediated by TRAIL/TRAIL-receptor via paracrine mechanisms, in initially resistant LU1205 melanoma cells.

Radiation, Arsenic, and Apoptosis in Melanoma

Arsenite is a two-sided sword: on the one hand, it is a wellestablished human carcinogen, and on the other hand, it has been
used successfully in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia
by inducing apoptosis (49). However, most melanomas are resistant
to sodium arsenite treatment. We have previously shown that only
f20% of human melanoma cell lines are sensitive to apoptosis
induction by arsenite alone (29). A recent clinical trial in the use of
single regimen of arsenite trioxide in the treatment of metastatic
melanoma failed to produce any significant improvement in clinical
outcome (50). These findings suggest that multimodality regimen is
required in the design of treatment strategy, a primary motivation
for the present study. A better understanding in the apoptotic
signaling pathways induced by arsenic treatment in melanoma cells
