Observational Study and Validation

Abstract
Chemotherapy response in patients with primary breast cancer is difﬁcult to predict and the role of host genetic
factors has not been thoroughly investigated. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in oxidative stress (OS)related genes, including estrogen–quinone metabolizing enzymes NQO2 and GSTM1-5, may inﬂuence disease
progression and treatment response. In this prospective observational study, nineteen polymorphisms tagging
known variations in candidate genes were genotyped and analyzed in 806 patients with primary breast cancer.
Three functional polymorphisms, which were shown to affect gene expression levels in experiments in vitro and ex
vivo, modiﬁed the effect of chemotherapy on disease-free survival. There were signiﬁcant interactions between
chemotherapy and individual polymorphisms or combined genotypes (designated as genetic score). Patients
harboring high genetic score had a 75% reduction in the hazard of disease progression compared with patients
with low genetic score when no chemotherapy was administered (HR ¼ 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10–0.63, P ¼ 0.005);
however, they received much less survival beneﬁt from adjuvant chemotherapy compared with patients with low
genetic score when chemotherapy was administered (HR ¼ 4.60 for interaction, 95% CI: 1.63–13.3, P ¼ 0.004).
These ﬁndings were validated in another population (n ¼ 339). In conclusion, germline polymorphisms in OSrelated genes affect chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer patients. Although reduced OS levels might prevent
breast cancer progression, they probably compromise the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy. Our ﬁndings
also indicate that host-related factors must be considered for individualized chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 72(2);

Introduction
It is well established that estrogens and their metabolites
play critical roles in breast carcinogenesis. One of the most
important mechanisms involved in this process is oxidative
stress (OS) generated by estrogen quinones (1). Cells have
approaches to reduce redundant quinines or semiquinones,
such as reducing them by quinone oxidoreductases (NQO) and
clearing them by glutathione S-transferases (GST). Of note, the
estrogen–quinone metabolizing enzymes are not only specifically involved in breast carcinogenesis but are also related to
the detoxiﬁcation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 1).

The NQO family consists of 2 members, NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase (NQO1) and NRH:quinine oxidoreductase
(NQO2), both of which catalyze the detoxiﬁcation of quinines
and protect against OS (2). NQO1 was recently identiﬁed as a
strong prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer (3).
The NQO1-deﬁcient phenotype is a defective anthracycline
response. In contrast, the role of NQO2 in breast cancer
prognosis, as well as in chemotherapy response, is still unclear.
Besides the NQO family, GSTs have been shown to have
important roles in protection against ROS by conjugating with
glutathione. GST detoxiﬁcation pathways are active in normal
breast tissue and GSTM and GSTP are the predominant
enzymes in the breast (4). The genes of the GSTM family are
arranged in a tandem of 50 -GSTM4-M2-M1-M5-M3-30 (5).
GSTM1 is of particular interest because it possesses a null
polymorphism that results in a complete absence of GSTM1
enzyme activity. Our previous studies concluded that genetic
variants in NQO2 and GSTM1-5 are related to breast cancer risk
to different extents (6, 7).
Thus far, genetic alterations in somatic tumor cells have
been shown to be correlated with prognosis, but the effects of
genetic variations are less well understood (8–10). We hypothesize that genes modifying susceptibility to breast cancer may
also inﬂuence disease progression and treatment response;
variations in estrogen–quinone metabolizing genes involved in
OS are good candidates. Notably, the relationship between OS

Genetic Variants in OS-Related Genes Predict Chemoresistance

and breast cancer prognosis is somewhat complicated. On one
hand, increasing evidence has implied that OS may facilitate
tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis through multiple mechanisms, including activation of the MAPK–HSP27
pathway, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, and inhibition of anti-proteases (11). A recent study also uncovered a
novel mechanism in which OS could affect tumor microenvironment and increase the migratory properties of stromal
ﬁbroblasts, which in turn potentiate breast cancer dissemination (12). On the other hand, most chemotherapy regimens
exert their cytotoxic effects through apoptosis which is mainly
mediated by ROS and concomitant OS (13, 14), indicating that
increased OS levels might enhance the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the inﬂuence of variations in
OS-related genes on breast cancer progression and prognosis
might depend on whether a patient underwent chemotherapy
or not.
To our knowledge, although adjuvant chemotherapy could
effectively reduce the risk of recurrence and mortality for
women with operable disease, only a fraction of patients
beneﬁt from it. It is difﬁcult to predict the response of patients
to chemotherapy. Many somatic factors such as nodal status,
tumor size, and expression of hormone receptors and HER2 are
routinely used to determine prognosis and response to speciﬁc
therapies (15). However, the roles of host-related factors, for
example, inherited genetic factors, have not been thoroughly
investigated. In this study, we investigate whether women
harboring genetic variations in estrogen–quinone metabolizing genes involved in OS experience different disease progression, and we explore the effect of these variations on chemotherapy response, which is determined by the survival after
diagnosis of breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.

Materials and Methods
Patients
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the
Shanghai Cancer Center of Fudan University, and each participant signed an informed consent document. This prospective observational study was initiated in 2004. All patients with
malignant breast cancer tumors who were willing to participate in the study were enrolled. For each participant, clinicopathologic and treatment data were recorded, disease outcome was followed up, and a blood sample was collected. From
January 2004 to January 2008, we recruited approximately 1,036
unrelated patients with pathologically conﬁrmed primary
breast cancer in the Shanghai Cancer Center. Genotyping of
the NQO2 and GSTM1-5 genes was done in 2008–2009 (6, 7, 16).
Patients selected for the present analysis fulﬁlled the following
inclusion criteria: (i), female patients diagnosed with unilateral
invasive breast cancer; breast carcinoma in situ (with or
without microinvasion) were excluded; (ii), pathologic examination of tumor specimens was carried out in the Department
of Pathology in our hospital; (iii), patients with operable tumor
and without any evidence of metastasis at diagnosis; (iv),
patients not receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy) or preoperative irradiation;
(v), patients harboring a rare 16-bp insertion allele of a triallelic

www.aacrjournals.org

polymorphism in the NQO2 gene were also excluded because of
the indeﬁnite function of that allele; (vi), with follow-up data
for at least 3 months; (vii), not treated with anti-HER2 therapy,
for example, trastuzumab.
Of the 1,036 unrelated patients who were originally enrolled
in the prospective observational study, 38 had bilateral breast
cancer, and 158 of the 998 unilateral patients were DCIS. In the
840 unilateral patients with invasive cancer, 34 patients were
further excluded due to not fulﬁlling other inclusion criteria. As
a result, 806 patients were included in this study as the test set.
The preoperative evaluation and examination has been
described elsewhere (17). The basic information of patients
is shown in Table 1. Determination of estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status was done by
pathologists in the Department of Pathology in our hospital.
Most of, but not all, patients with equal HER2 protein expression (immunohistochemistry 2þ) were also selected to have a
FISH test for HER2 gene ampliﬁcation. This was done according to established procedures that have been described elsewhere (18, 19). Because the data for tumor grade were lacking
in many cases, we did not include this variable in our analysis.
Postoperative recurrence risk category was mainly determined according to St. Gallen consensus. The choice of
chemotherapy depended on the risk category: patients with
moderate recurrence risk underwent cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin/epirubicin, and 5-Fu (CAF) regimen; patients with
low risk underwent cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
5-Fu (CMF) regimen, or AC regimen; and patients with high
risk would receive taxane-containing regimens [AC followed by
paclitaxel (P), or CAF followed by docetaxel (T), or TAC].
Approximately 100% and 85% of the patients that were treated
with chemotherapy received cyclophosphamide-containing
and anthracycline-based regimens, respectively. All of the
patients with positive hormone receptor status were recommended to take tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (only for
postmenopausal women) for 5 years. The strategy of systemic
treatments was updated according to the St. Gallen consensus
(15, 20, 21).
We also validated the signiﬁcant polymorphisms from the
ﬁrst set of tests in an independent population with mainly
familial/early-onset breast cancer cases (ref. 22; Table 1). Since
2000, the Shanghai Cancer Hospital has conducted a multicenter hospital-based gene mutation screening project to gain
a full understanding of the contribution of germline mutations
of high-penetrance genes to hereditary and early-onset breast
cancer in the Han Chinese population (22). Approximately 600
cases coming from 5 medical centers in China had been
collected between 2000 and 2008, and an additional 150 new
cases were recruited in 2008–2009 in our hospital. The eligibility criteria have been described elsewhere. Using earlyonset/familial breast cancer patients as a validation set is
acceptable because that, ﬁrst, although the etiology of sporadic
and familial/early-onset breast cancers is probably different,
the clinical administration of adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen does not differ between these 2 diseases according to
either NCCN breast cancer guideline or St. Gallen early breast
cancer consensus (15); second, prognosis of breast cancer
seems to be not affected by family history (23); third, evidence

has shown that in patients with BCRA1/2-negative familial
breast cancer (in this study, the familial patients were also nonBRCA1/2 carriers), the objective response rate of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is comparable with that of sporadic breast
cancer patients (24, 25). We ﬁnished genotyping of NQO2 and
GSTM1-5 in approximately 400 unrelated familial and earlyonset cases from southeast China (mainly Shanghai City and its
surrounding regions) in 2008–2009 (6, 7, 16). In this study, we
selected 339 patients who fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria
described above.
DNA/RNA preparation
Extraction, preservation of genomic DNA and mRNA, and
general PCR were done as previously reported (22). We also
collected 40 pairs of tissue samples including normal breast
(>3 cm away from tumor), peritumor (1–2 cm away from
tumor), and cancer tissue; each pair was collected from the
same patient.

Selection of genetic variants and genotyping
Selection of genetic variations of NQO2 and GSTM1-5 has
been described elsewhere (6, 7). The 19 polymorphisms analyzed are listed in Table 2. Detailed information of selection of
genetic variants is shown in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were genotyped on the 12-plex SNPstream platform (Beckman Coulter
Inc.; ref. 26). The genotyping work was carried out by the
Chinese National Human Genome Center (Shanghai), and
the call rates varied from 93.2% to 99.6%. The genotyping of
the GSTM1 gene-deletion variant and the I-29/D polymorphism have been reported elsewhere (6, 16). In the validation
study, the SNP rs2071002 (þ237A>C) was genotyped using a
PCR-RFLP–based assay (6). The samples were assayed in a
96-well PCR plate with a positive control consisting of a DNA
sample with known heterozygous genotype. Two research
assistants (K-D.Y and L.F) independently examined the gel
pictures and repeated the assays if they did not reach a

consensus on the genotype. An adequate quantity of restriction
enzyme was used to completely cleave PCR amplicons.
Samples with inconsistent outcomes in 2 independent tests
were directly sequenced. In addition, 10% of the samples were
randomly selected for repeated RFLP analysis for both of the
polymorphisms, and the results were 100% concordant.
Plasmid constructs, cell culture, transient transfection,
and luciferase assays
The pGL3-Basic reporter vector from Promega was used to
construct luciferase reporter plasmids using standard recombination techniques, as previously described (6). Brieﬂy, promoter regions of NQO2 (537 to þ529 bp, the transcriptional
start site is designated as þ1) containing haplotype I-C and DC were cloned from individual DNA samples and were then
cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector to generate pGL3-I-C and
pGL3-D-C constructs, respectively. Wang and colleagues have
indicated that approximately 500 to þ300 bp of NQO2
promoter region is sufﬁcient for basal expression of NQO2
(27). A site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to
generate pGL3-I-A and pGL3-D-A plasmids. The abbreviations
I, D, C, and A in above pGL3 constructs denote 29-bp insertion
allele of I-29/D polymorphism, 29-bp deletion allele of I-29/D
polymorphism, þ237C allele of rs2071002, and þ237A allele of
rs2071002, respectively. A human Sp1 expression vector was
constructed using the pcDNA 3.1 Directional TOPO Expression
Kit (Invitrogen). All constructs were veriﬁed by direct sequencing before use.
A human immortal normal breast epithelial cell line (HBL100) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Liquid nitrogen stocks were made upon receipt and
maintained until the start of each study. Morphology and
doubling times were also recorded regularly to ensure maintenance of phenotypes. Cells were used for no more than 3
months after being thawed. Thus, the cell line has been tested
and authenticated by ATCC and maintained in our laboratory
for less than 3 months, during which all experiments were
conducted. Cells were grown in complete medium consisting
of Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidiﬁed, 5% CO2
incubator at 37 C. For the luciferase experiments, cells were
transfected with 500 ng of plasmid DNA (4 haplotype vectors or
pGL3-Basic as a negative control) and cotransfected with 10 ng
of pRL-SV40 as a control for transfection efﬁciency, with or
without cotransfection of 1.0 mg of the Sp1 expression vector.
Transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase
activity was measured on a VeritasTM Microplate luminometer (Turner BioSystems) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System Kit (Promega). Each experiment was conducted in triplicate at least 3 times. Luciferase units were
calculated using the formula Fireﬂy luciferase units/Renilla
luciferase units. Fold increase was reported by deﬁning the
activity of the empty pGL3-Basic vector as one.
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR with SYBR Green ﬂuorescent-based assay
(TaKaRa) was done in a ﬂuorescence temperature cycler

www.aacrjournals.org

(Opticon, MJ Research) using the standard curves method
(28). All samples were done in triplicate at least 3 times.
cDNA-speciﬁc primers were designed using Primer Premier
5.00 (Premier Biosoft International). The following primers
were used for gene expression detection: NQO2 sense,
50 -GAAACCCACGAAGCCTACA-30 , and antisense, 50 -CAGCACCCTATCCATCCAG-30 (153 bp); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used for normalization.
Survival analysis, prognosis modeling, and receiver
operating characteristics curve
The categories analyzed for disease-free survival (DFS)
were the ﬁrst recurrence of disease at a local, regional, or
distant site; the diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer; and
death from any cause. All of these categories listed above
were considered DFS events. Patients with study end date
and loss of follow-up were considered to be censored.
Survival curves were determined using the Kaplan–Meier
method and compared by the log-rank test (univariate
analysis). HR for disease progression and 95% CIs were
calculated by the Cox risk proportion model. Multivariate
analysis was carried out using the Cox risk proportion model
(method: backward stepwise, likelihood ratio). Timescale of
follow-up time used for Cox proportional hazards model is
"month."
We used multivariate logistic regression to construct the
prediction model for DFS events. The aim of the model was to
predict the risk of occurrence of disease events of an individual
woman using individual clinicopathologic data, with or without personal genetic information. For a feasible modeling
procedure, we divided the patients into 2 groups. One group
experienced relapse during the follow-up period, whereas the
other group did not. All of the cases selected for modeling
should be followed up for at least 6 months, and a few cases
with insufﬁcient follow-up time were thus excluded from the
modeling analysis. Because we observed an interaction
between chemotherapy and genotypes of estrogen–quinone
metabolizing genes, we carried out modeling using independent variables [age (years), lymph node status (positive or
negative), tumor size (2 cm or >2 cm), ER (positive or
negative), PR (positive or negative), HER2 (positive or negative), and endocrine therapy (yes or no), with or without
genetic factor] in the nonchemotherapy group. The probability
of disease progression was estimated by the formula "eL/
(1þeL)", in which the value of L was derived by multivariate
logistic regression analysis (method: backward stepwise, likelihood ratio).
To further evaluate the accuracy of the prediction model,
we employed receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curves and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) with
its 95%CIs. The ROC curve shows the relation between
sensitivity and false-positive rate (1-speciﬁcity) of a given
test across all possible threshold values that deﬁne the
positivity of a disease or condition. In ROC analysis, the
independent variable was disease outcome (occurrence of
disease events or not), and the classiﬁcation variable is
probability of disease progression, which was calculated
using the formula eL/(1 þ eL).

Statistical analysis
Tests of association were conducted using Pearson c2 test.
Student t test was used to compare continuous variables
between 2 groups. A P value of less than 0.05 (2-sided) was
considered to be signiﬁcant. Statistical analysis was done using
Stata/SE 10.0 (Stata) and SPSS 12.0 (SPSS).

Results
Association of candidate gene genotypes with DFS
We studied the association of the genotypes of 19 genetic
variants with DFS in the dominant model (major homozygous
vs. heterozygous þ minor homozygous; Table 2). Analyses of a
few variants were unavailable in the recessive model (major
homozygous þ heterozygous vs. minor homozygous) or in the
additive model because of rare numbers of minor homozygous
(data not shown). In the overall population, 4 polymorphisms
(2 in NQO2, 1 in GSTM4, and the GSTM1-Null/Present polymorphism) showed signiﬁcant associations with DFS in univariate analysis. All of these polymorphisms were still related to
DFS after adjustment for clinicopathologic factors. However,
after conservative Bonferroni correction of multiple comparisons, none of the polymorphisms remained signiﬁcant.
Association of genotype with DFS is modiﬁed by adjuvant
chemotherapy
We further investigated the effect of chemotherapy on the
association between genotypes and DFS (Table 2). Interestingly, in patients not treated with chemotherapy, genotypes
with minor alleles of the 3 polymorphisms, NQO2-I-29/D
(Fig. 1A), NQO2-rs2071002 (Fig. 1B), and GSTM1-Null/Present
(Fig. 1C), showed signiﬁcantly better DFS than their major
counterparts, although these associations were not observed in
the chemotherapy group (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C). In
contrast, the variant genotype of NQO2-rs1143684 was significantly correlated with poorer DFS compared with the wildtype genotypes in the chemotherapy group, but this effect was
not observed in the nonchemotherapy group. After multivariate adjustment, all of the 4 polymorphisms still reached
signiﬁcant P values.
Interaction between genetic variations and resistance to
chemotherapy
The results presented above strongly suggest the presence of
an interaction. Multivariate analysis of interaction was done in
2 steps. In the ﬁrst step, the Cox regression model included
established prognostic factors but not genotypes (see details in
note of Table 3). We identiﬁed that positive lymph node status

NOTE: Multivariate analysis of interaction was done in 2 steps. In the ﬁrst step, the Cox regression model included established
prognostic factors (age, lymph node status, tumor size, ER, PR, HER2, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy) but not genotypes. The
ﬁrst step identiﬁed that lymph node status (P < 0.0001), tumor size (P < 0.0001), ER (P < 0.0001), HER2 (P ¼ 0.004), and chemotherapy
(P ¼ 0.0005) were signiﬁcant independent factors for DFS. As well, age tends to be signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.08). In the second step, interactions
between each genetic variant (in the dominant model) and chemotherapy were investigated along with adjustment for those factors
(with P < 0.10) identiﬁed in the ﬁrst step. This table shows the results of the second step.

Genetic Variants in OS-Related Genes Predict Chemoresistance

identiﬁed in the ﬁrst step (factors with P < 0.10). The interaction between genotypes and chemotherapy had strong
impacts on DFS (Table 3). For instance, an interaction implies
that patients with the variant allele of NQO2-rs2071002
received only 25% (1/4.02, 4.02 is the HR of interaction between
chemotherapy and rs2071002 genotype) of the beneﬁt from
adjuvant chemotherapy compared with patients with the wildtype genotypes. Interestingly, NQO2-I-29/D, NQO2-rs2071002,
and GSTM1-Null/Present not only interact with chemotherapy
but tend to be independent prognostic factors if their interactions to chemotherapy are adjusted.
Relationship between host genotypes and ER phenotype
It is well established that ER-positive tumors tend to be
resistant to chemotherapy (29). It is possible that the observed
interaction between chemotherapy resistance and genetic
variants is caused by a linkage of genetic variants to tumor
ER phenotype. Therefore, we studied the relationship between
genotype and tumor phenotype (Supplementary Table S1).
However, no signiﬁcant genotype–phenotype association was
found for the 4 signiﬁcant polymorphisms.
Functional polymorphisms alter expression of NQO2
We have shown that genetic variations in NQO2 and GSTM1
affect the resistance to chemotherapy. This is biologically
plausible for GSTM1-Null/Present because the GSTM1-null
genotype results in GSTM1 enzyme deﬁciency. However, the
functional basis of multiple variations in NQO2 requires further
inspection. Among the 4 crude signiﬁcant polymorphisms,
either in the overall population or in subgroups (Table 2), two
(NQO2-I-29/D, NQO2-rs2071002) located in the promoter can
affect gene expression, and one located in an exon results in an
amino acid change (NQO2-rs1143684). The remaining SNP
NQO2-rs9501910, which is located in an intron, has no potential
function. However, it has high linkage disequilibrium (LD) to
NQO2-rs1143684 with a D' of 0.88 and r2 of 0.77 (Fig. 2A),
indicating that it is a linked marker rather than a causal SNP.
We previously reported that the I-allele of NQO2-I-29/D introduces binding sites for the transcriptional repressor Sp3, and
the C-allele of NQO2-rs2071002 creates a new Sp1 binding site
(ref. 6; Fig. 2B). Here, we further show that the D-allele of NQO2I-29/D and the C-allele of NQO2-rs2071002 are associated with
higher activity of the NQO2 gene promoter in human normal
breast cells (Fig. 2C) and lead to higher expression of NQO2 in
normal breast and peritumoral tissues (Fig. 2D) compared with
their wild-type counterparts. However, NQO2 genotype and
NQO2 expression are not correlated in cancer tissue (Fig. 2D).
Validation of interaction between genotypes and
resistance to chemotherapy
It is critical to validate our ﬁndings that NQO2-I-29/D, NQO2rs2071002, and GSTM1-Null/Present are associated with disease progression in the nonchemotherapy group. To validate
the integral effect of multiple genetic variations, we developed
a combined "genetic score" by assigning "0" to risk genotypes
and "1" to protective genotypes of the 3 variants. Thus, each
patient had a genetic score ranging from 0 to 3. For convenience, we further divided patients into 2 groups (score 0–1,

www.aacrjournals.org

and score 2–3). In the test set, the original genetic score (with 4
categories) had a signiﬁcant discrimination capability in DFS
in the nonchemotherapy group (P ¼ 0.0027, Supplementary
Fig. S2A) but not in the chemotherapy group (P ¼ 0.088,
Supplementary Fig. S2B). The modiﬁed genetic score (with 2
categories) displayed similar discrimination capability (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). An interaction of genetic score
and chemotherapy was also observed (P ¼ 0.004, Table 3). In
the validation set, which consisted of 339 patients mainly with
familial/early-onset breast cancer, the genetic score tended to
become a predicator of DFS in the nonchemotherapy group
(P ¼ 0.050, Fig. 3A) but not in the chemotherapy group
(P ¼ 0.304, Fig. 3B). Similarly, an interaction between genetic
score and chemotherapy was observed with a borderline
signiﬁcance (HR ¼ 2.07, P ¼ 0.045).
Predictive value of polymorphisms in disease
progression
The genetic factors that are capable of predicting disease
progression could still have no clinical utility unless they can
offer additional information beyond what classic predictors
can already tell us. We evaluated the predictive value of genetic
score in disease progression in patients receiving no chemotherapy. Genetic score (0–1 vs. 2–3) was added in a traditional
model. ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60–0.80)
for the traditional model and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69–0.86) for the
combined model (Fig. 3C), suggesting that adding genetic
factors to classic factors markedly improved the prediction
capability (P ¼ 0.047 for AUC comparison).

Discussion
In this prospective observational study, we noted that
associations between DFS and germline polymorphisms in
the estrogen–quinone metabolizing genes involved in OS were
modiﬁed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The observed interaction
was successfully validated. Although the genetic variations
associated with an enhanced ROS-metabolizing capability
would reduce the hazard of disease progression among women
receiving no chemotherapy, they would compromise the efﬁciency of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Several prior studies have examined the association between
breast cancer disease outcome and genotypes of GSTM1 and
NQO2 (30–36). Our study is the only study that has investigated
the interaction between chemotherapy and genotypes. Our
results consistently indicate that genetic variants in estrogen–
quinone metabolizing genes play protective roles in disease
progression if no chemotherapy is administered. However, this
effect disappears after chemotherapy is administered; in other
words, patients harboring genotypes related to low ROS levels
receive limited, if any, beneﬁt from chemotherapy.
The conﬂicting outcome between the chemotherapy and
nonchemotherapy groups is explainable. In general, the protective genotypes that are associated with higher expression or
elevated activity of estrogen–quinone metabolizing enzymes
would reduce ROS levels and subsequently inhibit OS-induced
cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and blood supply to
residual cells or tumors in breast cancer patients after surgery

the transcriptional start site is designated as þ1) containing both I-29/D and rs2071002 (þ237A>C) polymorphisms are cloned into a pGL3-Basic reporter
gene. The I-29 allele of I-29/D introduces transcriptional–repressor Sp3 binding sites, whereas the A allele of rs2071002 abolishes the binding site of
transcriptional–activator Sp1. C, promoter activity in normal HBL-100 breast cells in vitro. Arbitrary units denote fold increase (pGL3-Basic vector is
set as one). Signiﬁcantly low promoter activity is observed in the I-A haplotype compared with the other 3 haplotype constructs (all P < 0.05). After transfection
of Sp1 expression vector, the I-A haplotype shows a lower activity compared with I-C (P < 0.01), D-A (P < 0.05), and D-C (P < 0.0001). Data represent
mean values, with error bars showing SE. Comparisons are done by ANOVA analysis and adjusted by the Games–Howell method if equal variances are not
assumed. D, box plots of NQO2 mRNA expression according to genotypes and tissue types. We collected 40 pairs of tissue samples including normal
breast (>3 cm away from tumor), peritumor (1–2 cm away from tumor), and cancer tissue from the same patient. The 40 pairs specimens are divided into
3 groups according to germline genotypes: group I, both major homozygous (II and AA, n ¼ 15); group III, at least one minor homozygous (DD or CC,
n ¼ 7); group II, the remaining genotypes (n ¼ 18). In normal tissue and peritumor tissue, the 3 genotype groups have differential expression of NQO2
(P ¼ 0.0001 and P ¼ 0.0003, respectively, by Kruskal–Wallis test); in cancer tissue, genotypes have no effect on gene differential expression (P ¼ 0.752 by
Kruskal–Wallis test). GAPDH is used for normalization.

(11). Some may argue that breast tumors have signiﬁcantly
higher OS levels than normal tissues and that a moderate
decrease of ROS caused by germline genetic variants might
have limited effects. This is true for advanced large tumors.
However, after surgery, patients have only disseminated cancer
cells or a tiny residual tumor rather than a large mass. The
small quantity of cancer cells is exposed to the normal microenvironment and affected by its surrounding, which consists of
thousands of normal cells. Variability in ROS levels in the
microenvironment caused by germline variations may inﬂuence the outcome of dormancy and extinction or proliferation
and dissemination of residual cancer cells. Moreover,

416

decreased ROS can protect normal breast cells from OSinduced DNA damage and reduce genetic instability, resulting
in prevention of second primary breast cancers. However,
when chemotherapy is administered, the situation is changed.
As we know, most chemotherapy regimens exert their cytotoxic effects by elevating the OS levels within breast carcinomas, pushing malignant cells "over the edge" and increasing OS
damage to a level that the cancer cells cannot cope with (14).
Although anthracyclines act primarily by interfering with
topoisomerase II activity, some studies indicated that many
active chemotherapeutic drugs in breast cancer treatment
(including anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide) are also

ROS-generating agents (14, 37). Therefore, we might speculate
that when chemotherapy is administered to a patient with
decreased ROS levels, the originally protective effect of ROS
might cause resistance to chemotherapy. The precise mechanism of interaction between ROS and chemoresistance in vivo,
however, needs further investigation. Another explanation is
that, because both anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide are
metabolized through reactions mediated by GSTMs (13), the
presence of GSTM1 could accelerate the inactivation and
metabolism mechanisms of these therapeutic agents.
The interaction between chemotherapy and genotypes of
ROS-reducing genes can account for the conﬂicting results
seen in previous studies with regard to the relationship
between GSTM1-null genotype and disease progression in an
adjuvant setting. For patients receiving no chemotherapy, the
GSTM1-present genotype tends to be protective (GSTM1 is one
of the 16 cancer-related genes within the 21-gene Oncotype-DX
assay for predicting recurrence of tamoxifen-treated, nodenegative breast cancer; ref. 38). For patients undergoing chemotherapy, GSTM1-present probably has a similar effect to
GSTM1-null (30–33). For mixed patients, the results tend to be
nonsigniﬁcant (34, 35). We also noted some SNPs in GSTM4
that were associated to different extents with DFS regardless of
whether chemotherapy was used or not. This issue needs
further study. Moreover, our data imply that NQO2 has similar

features to GSTM1. It is probable that NQO2 has an intrinsic
metabolizing capability for many chemotherapeutic agents.
We also found no change in expression of NQO2 gene in cancer
cells with different germline genotypes, which indicates that
many other factors (e.g., methylation, aberrant regulation)
rather than only the regulative effect of polymorphic alleles
inﬂuence NQO2 expression in cancer cells. This observation
may suggest that NQO2 expression levels in healthy tissues
affect disease progression, perhaps, by inﬂuencing tumor
microenvironment.
Our study has several limitations. First, as a prospective
observational study, but not a clinical trial, the chemotherapy
regimens in our study are not uniform. It is difﬁcult to
determine whether the chemoresistance is speciﬁc to a particular agent or to several agents. Second, genetic variants in
other OS-related genes as well as combinations of these
genotypes might provide a more accurate prediction of chemotherapy resistance. Third, because recurrence events are
time dependent, and the time-dependent model is complicated
to establish and to utilize, we employed a feasible modeling
procedure in our analysis, which however might compromise
the results.
In summary, our results suggest that although reduced OS
levels might be important in preventing breast cancer progression, they probably compromise the effectiveness of adjuvant

chemotherapy. Thus far, there are few rigorous data in the
literature to support individualized regimens of chemotherapy
according to host genotypes. The new understanding of interactions between chemotherapy resistance and host genetic
factors could impact basic research as well as clinical management, potentially leading to individualized strategies for
adjuvant chemotherapy. For instance, for patients with aggressive disease and also harboring genotypes associated with
higher expression or enhanced activity of ROS-reducing
enzymes, physicians may consider choosing chemotherapeutic
agents that exert their efforts by non/low OS-mediated
mechanisms such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids, rather than
anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide (14, 37). Finally, we
propose that combined germline genotypes of multiple genes
involved in ROS pathways might achieve a more precise
prediction of disease progression on the basis of classic somatic factors.
