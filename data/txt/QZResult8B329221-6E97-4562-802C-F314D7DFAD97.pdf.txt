Abstract
A previous in vitro study showed that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide antagonist, preserved
endothelial cells in culture from radiation-induced apoptosis. We proposed to validate the role of S1P in tissue
radioprotection by inhibiting acute gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome induced by endothelial cell apoptosis after
high dose of radiation. Retro-orbital S1P was injected in mice exposed to 15 Gy, a dose-inducing GI syndrome
within 10 days. Overall survival and apoptosis on intestines sections were studied. Intestinal cell type targeted by
S1P and early molecular survival pathways were researched using irradiated in vitro cell models and in vivo
mouse models. We showed that retro-orbital S1P injection before irradiation prevented GI syndrome by
inhibiting endothelium collapse. We defined endothelium as a specific therapeutic target because only these
cells and not intestinal epithelial cells, or B and T lymphocytes, were protected. Pharmacologic approaches using
AKT inhibitor and pertussis toxin established that S1P affords endothelial cell protection in vitro and in vivo
through a mechanism involving AKT and 7-pass transmembrane receptors coupled to Gi proteins. Our results
provide strong pharmacologic and mechanistic proofs that S1P protects endothelial cells against acute radiation
enteropathy. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9905–15. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Research has shed new light on the critical role of microvasculature collapse in tissue pathology induced by genotoxic
stresses (1). A notable, but controversial, example is the
involvement of microvascular endothelium in the early
response to radiation. The gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome,
an acute adverse effect of radiotherapy, has long been considered to be dependent solely on the dysfunction of the
intestinal clonogenic compartment (2, 3). According to this
single-target hypothesis, irradiation at doses of 8 Gy or greater
causes rapid stem cell apoptosis at positions 4 and 5 from the
base of the crypt, followed by a mitotic catastrophy 24 to 48

hours postradiation inhibiting crypt and villi regeneration. We
and others challenged this single cell target model arguing for
a more complex multitarget scenario. Microvascular endothelial apoptosis after single high dose of radiation constitutes a
primary lesion, which contributes to stem cell dysfunction,
crypt damage, villi denudation, organ failure, and death by GI
syndrome (1, 4–6). This syndrome was prevented when
endothelial cell apoptosis was pharmacologically inhibited
in mice by intravenous injection of basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF; ref. 1), an agonist of Toll-like receptor 5 (4) or
angiopoietin-I (5) prior to irradiation.
Endothelial cell apoptosis is also triggered by ceramide, a
sphingolipid generated upon hydrolysis of cell membrane
sphingomyelin by acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; ref. 7).
Genetic invalidation of ASM in mice inhibited the radiation-induced apoptosis of the microvascular endothelial cells
(1), which inhibited GI syndrome and switched the death of
the mouse to bone marrow (BM) aplasia. Sphingosine-1phosphate (S1P) is a product of ceramide deacylation and
phosphorylation of the sphingosine. Both S1P and ceramide,
which have opposing properties, determine cell fate (8).
Although ceramide is a proapoptotic factor, S1P promotes
survival by activating the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/
AKT pathway (9). S1P signaling may act either intracellularly
through yet unidentified receptor(s) (10) or extracellularly
through binding to G protein–coupled receptors termed
S1P receptors (11). Inhibition of ceramide-induced apoptosis
by S1P has been shown in several cell lines of different origins,
such as lymphocytes and tumor cells (8), and has been

confirmed in vivo. Administration of S1P 2 hours prior to
exposure to 0.1 Gy protects almost the entire ovarian follicle
population in mice, therefore preventing radiation-induced
sterility (12).
S1P is already known to modulate endothelial functions,
such as attenuate increase in vascular permeability by regulating junctional complexes (13). It has also been shown to
block in vitro endothelial cell death induced by H2O2 (14),
ethanol (15), and serum deprivation (16). We recently showed
that S1P protects human microvascular endothelial cells
(HMEC-1) from radiation-induced apoptosis (17). S1P acted
directly on the ceramide-mediated death, but not on radiation-induced DNA damage pathway, to protect endothelial
cells from ionizing radiation. In the present study, we propose
to validate the role of exogenous S1P as a relevant bioactive
lipid both to promote endothelial cell survival and to inhibit in
vivo one of the radiation-induced intestinal pathologies (e.g.,
GI syndrome). To clarify the involvement of the endothelium
in the GI syndrome, we sought to determine which cell types
and molecular events of the survival pathway are preferentially targeted by S1P.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, irradiation, and drug protocols
HMEC-1 and IEC-6 (intestinal epithelial cells) were kindly
provided by F.J. Candal (Center for Disease Control) and M.
Neunlist (Inserm UMR913, Nantes). Both were seeded at 2 
104 cells/cm2 as described (17, 18). Irradiation was carried out
in a Faxitron CP160 irradiator (Faxitron X-ray Corporation) at
a dose rate of 1.48 Gy/min. S1P [(1 mM) in PET vehicle (12);
Biomol], Ly294002 (1 mmol/L in DMSO; Biomol) and pertussis
toxin (PTx; 100 ng/mL in H2O; Sigma) were respectively added
2, 2.5, and 3 hours before irradiation with low serum media
(0.1% FBS).
Clonogenic and cell counting assays
For clonogenic studies, IEC-6 seeded at 2.5  103 cells per
60-mm dish were treated with or without (w/o) S1P and
irradiated at 2 to 15 Gy. After 2 weeks, colonies were scored
after staining with 1% Giemsa. Apoptotic HMEC-1 and IEC-6
floating in the medium were counted as described (17).
Apoptosis by APO 2.7 and caspase 3/7 assays
Apoptosis was assessed using the APO2.7 marker as previously described (17). For the caspase 3/7 assay, proteins (50
mg) diluted in 32 mL of caspase buffer (Promega) were incubated with 250 mmol/L of Ac-DEVD-AMC. Peptide cleavage
was measured every 15 minutes over 2 hours using a fluorescent plate reader (Dynatech) at excitation and emission
wavelengths of 365 and 465 nm, respectively. Specific caspase
activity was expressed in nanomoles of AMC released per
microgram of proteins.
Studies on immune cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy
donors were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium. Cells were
incubated w/o 1 mmol/L of S1P 2 hours before irradiation.

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

Cells (5  105) harvested at different time points postirradiation were hybridized with amcyan-CD3 or APC-CD19 (BD),
FITC-Annexin V (Beckman Coulter), and 7-AAD (BD) and then
processed using a FACS Canto II system (BD). Data were
analyzed with FACS Diva 6.1 software (BD).
Western blotting
After lysis, S1P- and/or PTx-treated HMEC-1 proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to ImmobilonP membrane (Millipore). The membrane was hybridized with antibodies of interest diluted at 1/1,000 for phospho-AKT (clone
9271; Cell Signaling), 1/1,000 for total AKT (clone 9272; Cell
Signaling), and 1/2,500 for actin (Santa Cruz).
Animal, irradiation, and drug protocols
Eight- to 12-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice (Charles River)
were housed in our animal core facility according to ongoing
national regulations issues by INSERM and the French Department of Agriculture. Whole-body irradiation (WBR) was delivered with a 60Co irradiator (Atomic Energy Canada) at 1 Gy/
min. BM transplantation was carried out as described (19).
After defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 100 mg/25
g mouse of S1P in 0.2 mL of PET was injected intravenously in
mice 30 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after irradiation. PTx
(1 mg/25 g mouse) into 0.2 mL Hank's solution was injected
intraperitoneally 2 hours and 30 minutes prior to, as well as
5 minutes and 2 hours, postirradiation. After defining the
MTD, 10 mg/25 g mouse of AKT inhibitor XI (AKTi; Merck)
in 0.2 mL of water was injected intravenously in mice
30 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after irradiation.
Mice survival, leukocytes counting, and cause of death
Actuarial survival was calculated by the Kaplan–Meier product limit method. Leukopenia was measured using hematology
analyzer (Melet-Schloesing) after harvesting peripheral blood
from irradiated and/or S1P-treated mice. Causes of death were
evaluated by autopsy (1). Five-micrometer sections of duodenal
and femoral segments from terminally ill animals were stained
with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E). GI damage and BM aplasia were
diagnosed when the small intestines displayed denuded mucosa
with no villus and no apparent crypts and the marrow showed
complete depletion of hematopoietic elements, respectively.
Crypt survival assay and epithelial cell death
Crypt survival assay (crypt colony count) was carried out on
proximal duodenum harvested 3.5 days after irradiation as
described (20). Surviving crypts per intestines cross section were
defined as containing at least 10 adjacent chromophilic cells and
1 Paneth cell, as well as a lumen. Ten circumferences scored in 4
mice were used to generate each data point. Assessment of crypt
epithelial cell death on small intestines harvested 24 hours after
irradiation was done as described (3). Dead crypt cells, characterized by abnormal nucleus and/or appearance of micronuclei, were counted in 150 crypts scored in 4 mice.
Immunohistology
Endothelial apoptosis was assessed in 5-mm intestines sections by FITC- or peroxydase-labeled TUNEL, as previously

S1P Protects from Radiation-Induced GI Syndrome

described protocol (1). Apoptotic cells were counted as
described (1). Phospho-AKT (736E11; Cell Signaling) and
FITC-CD31 antibodies (MEC13.3; BD Biosciences) at 1/50
and 1/200 dilution, respectively, were incubated overnight at
4 C after antigen was released by microwave heating in 0.1N
citrate solution. Phospho-AKT was detected after hybridization with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (BioSys),
diluted at 1/200. Slides counterstained with 0.1 mmol/L of 4’,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) were examined by
standard (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss) or confocal (Leica) microscopy for colocalization studies.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses, the Student t test (95% confidence
interval), and the Mantel log-rank test for survival were
conducted using StatView 6.0.

Results
S1P rescues mice from radiation-induced GI syndrome
The ability of S1P to protect mice from radiation-induced
death was estimated by overall survival. WBR of 15 Gy killed
100% of C57Bl/6 mice within 7 days, with a median survival time
of 5 days (Fig. 1A). Two retro-orbital injections of S1P delayed
significantly animal death by 4 days (median survival time of 9
days; P < 0.01 vs. 15 Gy). Autopsies on agonal animal, which died
5 days after exposure to 15 Gy, showed severe GI damage (e.g.,
GI syndrome), characterized by an absence of crypt/villus units
and an inflamed but preserved BM (Fig. 1B). Contrastingly,
autopsies of S1P-treated mouse, which died 9 days after irradiation, suffered from BM depletion whereas intestinal villi and
crypts were preserved. Irradiated animals died from BM aplasia
after S1P-injection instead of GI syndrome after sham treatment.
To determine the ability of S1P to inhibit intestinal apoptosis, TUNEL assays were done on duodenal sections from
mice 4 hours after 15-Gy WBR w/o S1P (Fig. 1C). High amount
of apoptotic cells (brown staining) was observed within the
lamina propria from irradiated mice but not in the epithelium
monolayer. S1P pretreatment inhibited radiation damage by
reducing the amount of apoptotic cells within the lamina
propria. Staining for FITC-TUNEL (green) and rhodamineCD31 (red) in intestinal sections from 15 Gy–irradiated mice
revealed colocalization of apoptotic and endothelial markers
as shown by the yellow staining on the merged image (Fig. 1D).
CD31, but not the TUNEL, remained visible in intestinal
sections from S1P-treated and irradiated mice. S1P inhibited
endothelial cell apoptosis compared with sham-irradiated
condition (mean of endothelial cell apoptosis per villus
±SEM 11.3±0.8% after 15 Gy vs. 3.7±0.5% after 15 Gy+S1P;
Fig. 1E) and dramatically reduced the percentage of severely
damaged villi containing more than 20 apoptotic cells (23.4%
after 15 Gy vs. 1.3% after 15 Gy FITC þ FITC S1P).
S1P enhances crypt radioprotection but not in vitro
epithelial cell radioresistance
To better define cellular mode of action of S1P in GI
syndrome protection, crypt survival assay was conducted in
mice 3.5 days after S1P treatment and exposure to a range of

ionizing radiation dose. The number of crypts per duodenal
circumference sections decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). After 15 Gy, less than 1 crypt per circumference
was quantifiable (0.6  0.3%). S1P pretreament dramatically
enhanced crypt survival (3.5  1.4%; P < 0.01 vs. 15 Gy),
reaching an isoeffect close to 13 Gy þ vehicle. Crypt radioprotection by S1P was confirmed by the fact that number of
epithelial mitotic catastrophy per crypt decreased in S1Ptreated mice (2.3  0.1 24 hours after 15 Gy vs. 1.3  0.1
after 15 Gy þ S1P; P < 0.01; Fig. 2B). However, neither clonogenic survival nor early radioprotection was enhanced in vitro
by S1P treatment of 15 Gy–irradiated IEC-6 primary epithelial
cells as supported by the 50% of clonogenic survival (DL50 of
3.2 and 4.2 Gy for vehicle- and S1P-treated groups, respectively; Fig. 2C) and by apoptosis (Fig. 2D; P > 0.1 S1P vs. sham
treatment at 24 and 48 hours postirradiation).
BM and lymphoid compartments are not protected
by S1P after irradiation
WBR induces BM aplasia with severe leukopenia. The ability
of S1P to protect lymphoid cells from radiation-induced death
has been investigated using human PBMCs. Using multiparametric FACS analysis with amcyan-CD3, FITC-Annexin V, and
7-AAD (Fig. 3A), we showed that radiation-induced death
increased similarly in T lymphocytes treated w/o S1P in a
time-dependent manner (72 hours: 50.5  13.4% after 15 Gy
and 47.3  7.3% after 15 Gy þ S1P; P > 0.1; Fig. 3B). FACS
analysis with APC-CD19, FITC-Annexin V, and 7-AAD (Fig. 3C)
showed that B lymphocytes were more radiosensitive than T
lymphocytes; however, no specific protection by S1P pretreament was observed (24 hours: 57  10% after 15 Gy and 58.3
 10.5% after 15 Gy þ S1P; P > 0.1; Fig. 3D). To confirm the
lack of radioprotection on hematopoietic cells by S1P, leukocytes were counted directly in irradiated mice on a daily basis.
A slightly increase in the number of white blood cells was
observed in sham-irradiated mice; however, leukocyte counts
in irradiated mice were shown to decrease dramatically in a
time-dependent manner, regardless of S1P treatment (day 4:
0.2  0.1% after 15 Gy vs. 0.2  0.1% after 15 Gy þ S1P; P >
0.1; Fig. 3E). Agonal mice treated with 15 Gy þ S1P presented
severe leukopenia and BM aplasia. Autologous BM transplantation 16 hours after 15 Gy WBR and S1P treatment definitely
explained the demise of the animals. If 15 Gy þ BM-treated
mice and 15 Gy–irradiated mice died within the time frame
(median survival: 5 days after 15 Gy; 6 days after 15 Gy þ BM;
P > 0.1); however, cotreatment with S1P þ BM increased
survival of irradiated mice. Half of S1P- and BM-treated mice
stayed alive 100 days postirradiation (median survival time:
9 days after 15 Gy þ S1P; >100 days after 15 Gy þ S1P þ BM;
P < 0.01). Surviving mice exhibited normal activity without
any gross dysfunction, except fur depigmentation due to
irradiation, until death that occurred suddenly 4 months
postirradiation.

caused the uncoupling of Gi proteins from the S1P receptors,
before treatment with S1P and exposure to 15 Gy. Radiationinduced death was inhibited by S1P (32.7  6.3% after 15 Gy
vs. 13.6  2.6% after 15 Gy þ S1P; P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 4A); however,
PTx treatment restored apoptosis in S1P-treated endothelial
cells to the level observed with exposure to 15 Gy alone (23.4

radiosensitivity (28.6  5.4%, P > 0.1 vs. 15 Gy), which suggests a direct inhibition of the S1P survival pathway. Inhibition
of S1P-induced endothelial cell survival by PTx was confirmed
by APO2.7 FACS analysis (Fig. 4B) and by a DEVDase assay
(Fig. 4C). We then tested whether endothelial cell survival
in the small intestines was enhanced by S1P through an
extracellular mechanism (Fig. 4D). Injection of PTx prior to

a 15-Gy WBR did not modify mice survival as compared with
that of sham-irradiated mice. However, PTx restored the
radiosensitivity pattern in mice pretreated with S1P (median
survival time: 8 days after 15 Gy þ S1P and 5 days after
15 Gy þ PTx þ S1P; P < 0.02) and caused animals to die
from GI syndrome in PTx- and S1P-treated mice instead of
BM aplasia in the S1P-treated cohort (Fig. 4E). As determined
by the TUNEL assay, PTx restored apoptotic cell pattern
(green fluorescence) within the small intestines of S1P-treated
and irradiated mice (Fig. 4F).

pretreatment. These results were also confirmed in vivo.
Pretreatment with S1P, but not S1P þ PTx, induced AKT
phosphorylation in mice within 15 minutes, specifically
within the lamina propria (Fig. 5B). Colocalization of rhodamine-a-phospho-AKT (red) and FITC-CD31 (green) into
intestinal cross sections of S1P-treated mice, as shown by the
yellow stain of the merged image (Fig. 5C), proves that S1P
specifically induced AKT activation in the endothelial cells. To
show the key role of AKT activation in S1P-mediated endothelial
survival, HMEC-1 cells were pretreated with LY290004 prior to
S1P treatment and 15-Gy exposure. PI3K inhibitor alone did not
modulate HMEC-1 sensitivity (27  6% after 15 Gy þ LY290004
vs. 23.1  3.4% after 15 Gy; P > 0.1; Fig. 6A); however, LY290004
inhibited S1P-mediated radioprotection (23.8  6.5% after

was confirmed by APO2.7 FACS analysis (Fig. 6B). We then
tested the ability of AKT inhibition to reverse radioprotection
in our murine GI syndrome model. Pharmacologic action of
water-soluble AKTi was proven by disappearance of rhodamine
staining for phospho-AKT, detectable within the intestines of
S1P-treated mice (Fig. 6C). Injection of AKTi did not modify
mice survival as compared with sham-irradiated mice
(Fig. 6D) but reduced survival time of S1P-treated and

irradiated mice (median survival time: S1P ¼ 8 days;
AKTi þ S1P ¼ 6 days; P < 0.01). As expected, animals died
from GI syndrome in AKTi- and S1P-treated mice instead of
BM aplasia in the S1P-treated cohort (Fig. 6E).

Discussion
Recent studies have shed new light on the critical role of the
microvasculature in the regulation of tissue response to
stresses. Endothelial cell apoptosis is initiated by activation/relocalization of ASM-inducing ceramide generation
leading to caspase activation. S1P, a ceramide antagonist,
can protect quiescent endothelial cells in culture from radiation-induced apoptosis (17). In the present study, we establish
S1P as a new, relevant, bioactive lipid acting to prevent
endothelial apoptosis and acute organ necrosis in radiation-induced GI syndrome.
Very recently, the role of endothelial cell apoptosis in the
pathogenesis of GI syndrome has been challenged. Mice
selectively deleted not only for the apoptotic bax gene in
hematopoietic and endothelial cells through Tie2Cre-loxP
system but also for the apoptotic bak1 gene in their whole

that observed after bFGF treatment at the same dose (3.2

apoptosis by S1P is correlated with the prevention of the GI

Despite an enhancement of crypt survival and an inhibition
of crypt epithelial cell mitotic catastrophy by S1P (Fig. 2A and
B), direct protection of irradiated epithelial cells by S1P seems
to be excluded according to our in vitro studies using IEC-6
cells (Fig. 2C and D), as well as transformed intestinal T84,
colonic tumor Caco2, and HCT116 epithelial cell lines (data not
shown). As already described in a coculture model, irradiation
of HMVEC endothelial cells in the presence of nonirradiated
T84 epithelial cells induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis of the
epithelial layer (23). Blocking radiation-induced endothelial
cell apoptosis with S1P protects the epithelial compartment
indirectly. Alternately, lisophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid

functionally related to S1P, protects IEC-6 cells from radiationinduced death (24). Radiation-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and the GI syndrome were not inhibited by LPA or
dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate despite their capacity to
bind to S1P receptors with a low affinity (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The discrepancy of S1P radioprotection observed
between the endothelium and the epithelium may be explained
by the difference in cell death mechanisms. Endothelial cells
die rapidly by a ceramide-dependent apoptosis, whereas
epithelial cells are more subject to delayed mitotic death (25).
The GI syndrome is mainly related to endothelial and
epithelial dysfunctions, whereas BM aplasia is triggered by
the death of hematopoietic stem cell. Binding of extracellular
S1P to its receptors has been reported to enhance trafficking

of T and B lymphocytes in the lymphoid system as well as their
migration in nonimmune tissues (26). T and B lymphocytes
were sensitive to radiation in a time-dependent manner, with
no protection by S1P pretreatment (Fig. 3), which proves a lack
of molecular redundancy in the S1P-mediated immune cell
maturation and survival processes. Blood counts and histology of agonal mice show a lack of protection by S1P from
radiation-induced leukopenia and BM aplasia, respectively.
This was confirmed by the fact that mice injected with S1P
and irradiated at 15 Gy were protected for more than 4 months
by transplantation of fresh nonirradiated BM 16 hours postirradiation.
The present study sheds new light on the mechanism
underlying S1P radioprotection, which was largely unknown.

S1P protection of oocytes from radiation- and doxorubicininduced death (12, 19) was not inhibited by PTx, arguing for a,
S1P-dependent intracellular protective pathway, at least in
oocytes. Either intra- or extracellular S1P pathways have been
considered to be involved in survival signaling in endothelial
cells. Serum starvation–induced human umbilical vein
endothelial cell (HUVEC) death is enhanced by inhibiting
either the extracellular pathway through PTx treatment
(27) or the intracellular pathway through overexpression of
sphingosine kinase 1 (28). Our data support the involvement of
the extracellular pathway in both in vitro and in vivo S1Pinduced endothelial cell radioprotection (Fig. 4). S1P protection of endothelial cell apoptosis detected by APO2.7 in
HMEC-1 or directly within the lamina propria was reversed
by PTx pretreatment. Extracellular S1P has not been directly
studied in vivo but has been indirectly investigated through
the use of related agonist/antagonist to S1P receptors. The
most studied drug is FTY720, a synthetic myriocin analogue
that acts as a functional antagonist by internalizing S1P1
receptors, which are then degraded by the proteosome (29).
FTY720 prevents S1P-mediated biological functions in HUVEC
such as tumor angiogenesis and Ca2þ mobilization (30).
Endothelial apoptosis has not been examined after the treatment with FTY720; however, knocking out the S1P1 or S1P3
receptors, using an antisense strategy, reverses S1P protection
against serum deprivation–induced HUVEC death (16).
Further investigations using S1P receptor transgenic models
or specific inhibitors will better define mode of action of the
S1P as a survival signal.
The PI3K/AKT couple is considered as a robust prosurvival mediator enforcing endothelial cell integrity (31). S1P

pretreatment of mice specifically induced AKT phosphorylation in endothelial cells within the lamina propria but not
in the epithelial layer. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo
studies showed that AKT phosphorylation is under the
control of the extracellular S1P pathway, as shown by the
inhibition of S1P-induced phospho-AKT by PTx pretreatment (Fig. 5). The fact that pharmacologic inactivation of
phospho-AKT blocked S1P-induced protection of the small
intestines after irradiation (Fig. 6) strongly supports the
hypothesis that the endothelial compartment plays a crucial
role in the regulation of the fate of the small intestines after
exposure to ionizing radiation. Recently, treatments with
insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and bFGF have been shown
to activate AKT phosphorylation in crypt columnar cells and
inhibit PUMA and p53-mediated GI damage (32). Because
S1P receptors are expressed in the intestinal epithelial
mucosa (personal data), we cannot exclude the fact that
S1P activate AKT in crypt epithelial stem cells. However, no
crypts or epithelial cells were shown to be positive for
phospho-AKT staining in S1P-treated mice. This apparent
discrepancy may be due to the kinetics of AKT phosphorylation. Although S1P induces phosphorylation in endothelial cells within 15 minutes, AKT is activated in crypt
columnar cells 4 hours after IGF-1 and bFGF treatment.
Different pharmacologic strategies succeeded in inhibiting AKT activation and enhancing tumor endothelial cell
radiosensitivity (33), with no observation on normal tissue
radiotoxicity. In our study, the fact that phospho-AKT
staining was untraceable in small intestine sections from
untreated mice and AKTi treatment did not modulate death
of 15 Gy–irradiated mice could be considered as a first proof
