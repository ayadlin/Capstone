Abstract
Smac mimetics block inhibitor of apoptosis proteins to trigger TNFa-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells.
However, only a small subset of cancer cells seem to be sensitive to Smac mimetics and even sensitive cells
can develop resistance. Herein, we elucidated mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and acquired resistance of
cancer cells to Smac mimetics. In vitro and in vivo investigations revealed that the expression of the cell
surface protein LRIG1, a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), is downregulated in resistant
derivatives of breast cancer cells sensitive to Smac mimetics. RNA interference–mediated downregulation of
LRIG1 markedly attenuated the growth inhibitory activity of the Smac mimetic SM-164 in drug-sensitive
breast and ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, LRIG1 downregulation attenuated TNFa gene expression
induced by Smac mimetics and increased the activity of multiple RTKs, including c-Met and Ron. The
multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors Crizotinib and GSK1363089 greatly enhanced the anticancer activity
of SM-164 in all resistant cell derivatives, with the combination of SM-164 and GSK1363089 also completely
inhibiting the outgrowth of resistant tumors in vivo. Together, our ﬁndings show that both upregulation of
RTK signaling and attenuated TNFa expression caused by LRIG1 downregulation confers resistance to Smac
mimetics, with implications for a rational combination strategy. Cancer Res; 72(5); 1229–38. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Dysfunction of apoptosis is a hallmark of human cancer
and confers resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Targeting key apoptosis regulators such as inhibitors of apoptosis
(IAP) with the goal of overcoming apoptosis resistance of
cancer cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy. The mammalian family of IAPs includes cellular IAP1 (cIAP1, BIRC2),
cIAP2 (BIRC3), X-linked IAP (XIAP, BIRC4), survivin (BIRC5),
and melanoma IAP (ML-IAP, BIRC7), which are frequently
overexpressed in cancer cells and associated with chemoresistance, disease progression, and poor prognosis (1–3). IAPs
such as XIAP and cIAP1/2 are endogenously antagonized
by Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of
caspases/direct IAP binding with low pI) through interaction of the N-terminal AVPI tetrapeptide of Smac with the
baculovirus IAP repeat domains of IAPs (4, 5). Small moleAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer

cules that have been designed to mimic the IAP-binding
AVPI motif of Smac (known as Smac mimetics) function as
antagonists of multiple IAPs. Smac mimetics can potently
induce apoptosis in some cancer cell lines and inhibit tumor
growth in xenograft tumor models (6–11). Five such compounds are currently in early clinical development as a novel
class of anticancer drugs (1, 2).
Smac mimetics target cIAP1/2 and XIAP to induce TNFadependent apoptosis (8–10). However, only a small subset of
cancer cell lines is prone to Smac mimetic–induced apoptosis (8, 12). Exogenous TNFa, TRAIL (6, 8, 12), and IL-1b
(13) all signiﬁcantly enhance the ability of Smac mimetics to
induce apoptosis. Downregulation of c-FLIP also enhances
Smac mimetic–induced apoptosis in a variety of human
cancer cell lines (12). Preclinical studies showed that xenograft tumors initially responding to Smac mimetic treatment
regrow after treatment ends, indicating emergence of Smac
mimetic–tolerant cells in the tumors (8). In lung cancer cells,
cIAP2 protein levels rebound following Smac mimetic treatment, and inhibition of cIAP2 expression sensitizes resistant
cells to Smac mimetic treatment in vitro, suggesting one
mechanism for tumor cells to evade Smac mimetic–induced
apoptosis (14).
Hence, the clinical beneﬁt of Smac mimetic–based cancer
therapy will be limited by intrinsic and/or acquired drug
resistance. An in-depth understanding of the resistant mechanisms to Smac mimetics will help to identify the patients most
likely to respond to this new class of drugs and to develop
mechanistic based approaches to overcome drug resistance. In

this study, we investigated the mechanisms of resistance to
Smac mimetics in breast and ovarian cancer cells using a highly
potent Smac mimetic SM-164, which contains 2 nonpeptidic
mimetics of the AVPI tetrapeptide binding motifs and mimics
the natural dimeric Smac protein (7, 15).

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
Bivalent SM-164 and monovalent SM-406/AT-406 were
described previously (7, 16). PF2341066 (Crizotinib),
GSK1363089 (XL-880), AT-7867, U0126, and SKI-606 were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals. A detailed list of reagents
and antibodies used are in Supplementary Information Materials and Methods.
Cell culture, cell viability and apoptosis assays
MDA-MB-231, SKOV-3, MDA-MB-453, HCC38, HCC70, and
OVCAR-4 cell lines were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured as recommended.
All these cell lines were authenticated by ATCC and were
passaged fewer than 6 months after purchase for all the
experiments. Cell viability was evaluated by a WST-8 assay
(Dojindo; ref. 7). Apoptosis was analyzed using an Annexin
V/propidium iodide (PI) detection kit (Roche). In combination studies, drugs were added simultaneously to the cells
and combination index (CI) was calculated using the Chou–
Talalay method (17).
Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated with an RNA MiniPrep kit
(Sigma). Affymetrix human U133 Plus 2.0 chips were used
for the hybridization. For real-time PCR, cDNA was synthesized using cDNA reverse transcription kits (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene expression assays were carried out
with TNFa (Hs00174128_m1), LRIG1 (Hs00394267_m1), and
GAPDH (Hs99999905_ml) gene–speciﬁc primers/probe sets
(Applied Biosystems) using an ABI 7900HT PCR machine.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was
used for normalization. Relative quantitation of mRNA was
calculated by the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method.
All microarray data have been deposited into the GEO
repository (GEO accession number: GSE33827).
RNA interference, immunoblotting, and TNFa ELISA
ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools for LRIG1, TNFR1, Ron,
c-Met, and nontargeting negative control siRNAs were from
Dharmacon. Transfection was done using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting was carried out as
described (7). Concentrations of secreted TNFa in culture
medium were determined using the Quantikine HS Human
TNFa ELISA kit (R&D Systems; ref. 7).
In vivo xenograft studies
In vivo studies were conducted under a protocol approved by
the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the
University of Michigan. Severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(SCID) mice bearing xenograft tumors were treated with

1230

SM-164 as described before (7). Tumor sizes were measured
2 to 3 times per week.
Statistical analyses
For the cell viability assay, data were plotted as mean  SD
and sigmoid ﬁtted (variable slope). Differences in mean values
of cell viability among different groups were analyzed by 2-way
ANOVA. For in vivo studies, signiﬁcance (P) was calculated by
Student t test, with a P value of less than 0.05 being considered
as signiﬁcant. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and all statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.

Results
Lack of TNFa production contributes to Smac mimetic
resistance in the sublines from MDA-MB-231 xenograft
tumors
As a potent Smac mimetic, SM-164 displays a strong
in vitro anticancer activity against a subset of human cancer
cell lines (7). It also effectively inhibits tumor growth in the
xenograft model of the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer
cell line (7). Although SM-164 achieved partial tumor regression, all the regressed tumors started to regrow after treatment ended (Fig. 1A), similar to a previous observation that
HCC461 non–small cell lung xenograft tumors treated with
another potent Smac mimetic (8). These data indicated that
resistant cancer cells emerge from initially sensitive tumors
following Smac mimetic treatment.
To elucidate the resistant mechanisms, we isolated MDAMB-231 tumor cells from the regrown tumors and established
8 sublines. These 8 sublines exhibited polarized sensitivity to
SM-164 treatment, with T2, T3, T4, and T5 sublines resistant
(IC50 > 200 nmol/L) and T1, T6, T7, and T8 sublines sensitive
(IC50 < 20 nmol/L) to SM-164 (Fig. 1B). Extended treatment
of resistant sublines only modestly increased their susceptibility to SM-164 (Supplementary Fig. S1A), suggesting that
the resistance is not due to a delayed response to SM-164.
The 4 SM-164–resistant sublines were also cross-resistant
(IC50 > 5 mmol/L) to a monovalent Smac mimetic AT-406
(ref. 16; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Consistently, SM-164 effectively induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, 2 biochemical
markers for apoptosis, in parental and the sensitive sublines
but not in the resistant sublines (Fig. 1C).
SM-164, like other Smac mimetics, targets cIAP1/2 and
induces TNFa-dependent apoptosis following cIAP1/2 degradation and NF-kB activation (7). However, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in SM-164–induced degradation of
cIAP1/2 and key molecular events in canonical and noncanonical NF-kB activation [upregulation of NF-kB–inducing
kinase (NIK), phosphorylation of p65(Ser536), and processing
of p100] among the parental cells, sensitive and resistant
sublines (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Interestingly,
although SM-164 induced robust production of TNFa in the
parental cells and sensitive sublines in culture medium, it only
weakly increased the levels of TNFa protein in all the resistant
sublines (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. S2B). Real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that although TNFa
mRNA levels were reduced in all the MDA-MB-231 tumor

sublines compared with the parental cells, there was no
signiﬁcant difference between the sensitive and resistant sublines (Supplementary Fig. S2C). However, SM-164 signiﬁcantly
enhanced TNFa mRNA expression in the parental cell line and
all the sensitive sublines, but not in the resistant sublines
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). Of note, all the resistant sublines still
respond to TNFa-induced autocrine upregulation (Supplementary Fig. S2D), suggesting that SM-164 and TNFa induce
TNFa mRNA expression via distinct mechanisms.
To determine whether lack of SM-164–induced TNFa production is responsible for the resistance, we treated cells with
SM-164 together with recombinant human TNFa. Although
exogenous TNFa only modestly enhanced the activity of SM164 in the parental cells and T6-sensitive subline, it dramatically potentiated SM-164–induced apoptosis in all the resistant sublines (Fig. 1E), indicating that the TNFa-mediated

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptotic pathway was intact in these resistant cells. Indeed,
the parental cells as well as the T2-resistant and T6-sensitive
sublines expressed comparable levels of TNFR1, RIPK1, FADD,
TRADD, and TRAF2, key components for TNFa-mediated
signaling (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Although the expression
of cIAP2 was enhanced by exogenous TNFa, SM-164 still
efﬁciently reduced cIAP2 levels in these cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Recombinant TNFa or TRAIL both also restored the
sensitivity of all the resistant sublines to SM-164 (Supplementary Fig. S2E). However, conditioned medium from MDA-MB231 cells treated with SM-164 only modestly enhanced the
activity of SM-164 in these resistant sublines (Supplementary
Fig. S2E), suggesting that these resistant cells have a higher
threshold for TNFa-mediated apoptosis upon Smac mimetic
treatment and there must be additional factor(s) contributing
to the resistance in these cells.

Downregulation of LRIG1 confers resistance to SM-164
We further characterized the role of LRIG1 in the regulation
of Smac mimetic activity. Knockdown of LRIG1 as well as
TNFR1 markedly attenuated the growth inhibitory activity of
SM-164 in MDA-MB-231 and SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells
(Fig. 2A). However, knockdown of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), a known target of LRIG1 (18, 23, 27), had no
signiﬁcant effect on the activity of SM-164 (Fig. 2A). Silencing
LRIG1 greatly reduced apoptosis induction by SM-164 in
both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and also signiﬁcantly
attenuated SM-164–induced cleavage of PARP, but had no
signiﬁcant effect on SM-164–induced degradation of cIAP1 and
cIAP2 (Fig. 2B). Neither the protein levels nor surface expression of TNFR1 were signiﬁcantly altered by the depletion of
LRIG1 (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S4B). The possible off-target
effects of the siRNA against LRIG1 were excluded by employing
multiple siRNAs targeting different regions of LRIG1 mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S4C, S4D). The growth inhibitory activity of
SM-164 was also reduced upon silencing LRIG1 in 4 additional
SM-164–sensitive breast and ovarian cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that LRIG1 may be a common
regulator of the activity of Smac mimetics.

LRIG1 is downregulated in the in vivo–selected
MDA-MB-231 resistant sublines
To further dissect the resistant mechanisms, we employed
genome-wide gene expression proﬁling to identify genes
that may be associated with the resistance using T2- and
T3-resistant sublines, T6- and T8-sensitive sublines, and the
parental cells. Surprisingly, only 10 genes were consistently
differentially expressed by more than 1.5-fold in T2- and
T3-resistant sublines compared with T6- and T8-sensitive
sublines and the parental cells in Affymetrix microarray
analysis (Supplementary Table S1). Real-time RT-PCR and
immunoblotting analyses of 9 genes with known functions in
all 4 resistant sublines, 4 sensitive sublines, and the parental
cells showed that only LRIG1 (leucine-rich repeats and
immunoglobulin-like domains 1) and WT1 (Wilms Tumor 1)
are consistently differentially expressed between the resistant and sensitive groups of cells (Fig. 1F, Supplementary
Fig. S3A and B).
Functional validation showed that knockdown of LRIG1, but
not WT1 and 4 other genes, by siRNAs signiﬁcantly attenuated
the growth inhibitory activity of SM-164 in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and D). LRIG1 is a putative tumor
suppressor whose ectopic expression inhibits the growth of a
variety of cancer cell lines in vitro and negatively regulates
multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) by enhancing their
ubiquitination and degradation (18–27). LRIG1 also regulates
epidermal stem cell quiescence, and its expression deﬁnes a
distinct multipotent stem cell population in mammalian epidermis (28, 29).

Figure 2. Downregulation of LRIG1 confers resistance on SM-164–
mediated cell growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 and SKOV-3 cells. A,
cells were transfected with siRNAs for 2 days and then treated with SM164 for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined by WST assay. Data are
representative of 3 independent experiments. B, cells were transfected
with negative control or LRIG1-speciﬁc siRNAs for 2 days, then treated
with 5 nmol/L of SM-164 for 6 hours (MDA-MB-231) or 16 hours (SKOV-3)
before being collected for immunoblotting.

by treating the parental cells in vitro, we obtained SM-164–
tolerant cells (MDA-MB-231/R) by treating MAD-MB-231 cells
with SM-164 at 50 nmol/L, 10 times of its IC50 value, for more
than 3 weeks. The MDA-MB-231/R cells became highly resistant to SM-164 (Fig. 3A) and also failed to produce TNFa upon
SM-164 treatment (Fig. 3B). Real-time RT-PCR showed that
both LRIG1 and TNFa expression were reduced in MDA-MB231/R cells compared with the parental cells (Fig. 3C and D).
Similarly, SM-164–resistant SKOV-3 cells (SKOV-3/R) were
obtained by treatment of SKOV-3 cells with SM-164 at concentrations 10 times of its IC50 for more than 3 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Compared with the parental cells, the
SKOV-3/R cells had reduced levels of LRIG1 protein, and SM164–induced TNFa production and apoptosis were much
reduced in the resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B and C).
To investigate whether the resistance to SM-164 obtained
from in vitro and in vivo is acquired during treatment or
results from a selection of preexisting resistant subpopulations, we isolated and evaluated single clones of MDA-MB-231
cells. Of 106 clones evaluated, 3 (2F4, 3E8, and 3F7) were
highly resistant to SM-164 (Fig. 3A). The remaining 103 clones
were equally sensitive to SM-164 as the parental cell line. The
3 resistant clones had greatly reduced mRNA expression for
both LRIG1 and TNFa (Fig. 3C and D) and failed to produce
TNFa upon treatment with SM-164 (Fig. 3B).

LRIG1 regulates SM-164 induced TNFa expression
We next investigated whether there is a potential direct
link between LRIG1 and SM-164–induced TNFa production.
Upon knockdown of LRIG1, SM-164–induced TNFa production was signiﬁcantly attenuated in both MDA-MB-231 and
SKOV-3 cell lines (Fig. 4A and B), and SM-164 induced TNFa
mRNA expression was also attenuated (Fig. 4C and D). In
contrast, TNFa- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNFa
mRNA expression was either marginally affected or even
enhanced upon knockdown of LRIG1 in these cell lines
(Fig. 4C and D). These observations were consistent with
our ﬁndings that SM-164-, but not TNFa-induced TNFa
mRNA, expression was diminished in the LRIG1 low expressing resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Furthermore,
depletion of LRIG1 signiﬁcantly attenuated SM-164–induced
TNFa promoter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX) efﬁciently blocked SM-164-, but not TNFa- or LPSinduced TNFa mRNA expression (Fig. 4E and F), suggesting
that SM-164–induced TNFa mRNA expression requires
de novo protein synthesis. Thus, knockdown of LRIG1 in
Smac mimetic sensitive cancer cells recapitulates the phenotypic features of in vivo and in vitro selected resistant cells,
and LRIG1 modulates the activity of SM-164, at least in part,
by directly regulating SM-164–induced TNFa expression.

Collectively, these data suggested that Smac mimetic
resistant cells preexist in the bulk population of parental
cells, and SM-164 treatment selectively enriches the resistant
subpopulations, which share a common attribute of reduced
expression of LRIG1 and are unable to produce TNFa upon
treatment with SM-164.

Because Smac mimetics induce NF-kB–stimulated production of TNFa (9), we assessed the effects of LRIG1 knockdown
on the NF-kB components. Depletion of LRIG1 had no signiﬁcant effect on SM-164–induced phosphorylation of IkBa
(S32/36) and p65(S536) (indicators of the activation of the
canonical NF-kB pathway), and upregulation of NIK and
processing of p100 protein (indicators of the activation of
the noncanonical NF-kB pathway) in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Depletion of p65 (Rel A), a subunit of
NF-kB complex, indeed diminished the constitutive expression
of TNFa in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C–E).
Collectively, these data suggested that, whereas constitutive
expression of TNFa requires NF-kB, LRIG1 speciﬁcally regulates Smac mimetic–induced TNFa expression.
Multiple RTKs are upregulated in
MDA-MB-231–resistant cells
LRIG1 negatively regulates several RTKs by enhancing their
degradation (18–27). Indeed, the levels of multiple phosphoRTKs were increased in the resistant cells compared with the
parental cells, on the basis of phospho-RTKs proﬁling of the
MDA-MB-231 parental and its T2-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A). The cross-talk between different members of the
RTK superfamily is prevalent in cancer cells, and the RTK
coactivation is an important mechanism by which cancer cells
achieve drug resistance (30). Phospho-tyrosine proﬁling
revealed that the levels of total tyrosine phosphorylation,
particularly those proteins between 80 and 200 kDa, were
much higher in all the resistant sublines cells than in parental
and sensitive sublines (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Immunoblotting showed that, although there was no major difference in
the protein levels of IAPs and TNF receptors, the levels of

multiple RTKs were much higher in the resistant sublines than
in the sensitive sublines and parental cells (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S8C1).
RTK signaling activates multiple downstream effector pathways, including Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTORp70S6K (31, 32). RTKs also activate Src family kinases to
propagate signaling cascade (33). Phosphorylation at certain
residues of the signaling nodes indicates the activation status
of these pathways. The levels of p-Src(Y416), p-p70S6K(T389),
and p-Akt(S473; Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S8C2) were
increased in the resistant sublines compared with the sensitive
sublines, indicating an enhanced activation of Src and PI3KAkt pathways in the resistant sublines. No signiﬁcant difference was observed in the levels of p-ERK1/2(S202/Y204) among
the parental, sensitive, and resistant sublines (Supplementary
Fig. S8C2). Furthermore, silencing LRIG1 also increased the
levels of multiple RTKs, such as c-Met and Ron, in MDA-MB231 and SKOV-3 (Fig. 5B), indicating a direct role of LRIG1 in
regulating these RTKs.

tivity of the T2-resistant cells to SM-164 (Supplementary Fig.
S9), suggesting that multiple RTKs contribute to Smac mimetic
resistance and simultaneous blockade of multiple RTK signaling is necessary to sensitize the resistant cells to SM-164. We
therefore tested 3 multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI) on the activity of SM-164 in the resistant cells.
GSK1363089 (GSK) and PF2341066 (PF) are potent inhibitors of c-Met, Ron, and several other RTKs (34–36). SKI-606
(SKI) is a dual-inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases with activity
against other tyrosine kinases (37, 38). Although these TKIs
alone had a modest growth inhibitory effect (IC50 > 5 mmol/L)
against the T2-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S10A), they
greatly enhanced the activity of SM-164, with a CI (17) ranging
from 0.25 to 0.61 (Fig. 5C). U0126, a selective inhibitor of
MEK1/2, or AT-7867 (AT), a dual inhibitor of Akt and p70S6
kinase, minimally or modestly enhanced the activity of
SM-164, respectively (Fig. 5C). Combination treatment of
SM-164 with GSK or SKI led to a signiﬁcant increase in PARP
cleavage and a decrease in cyclin D1 protein compared with
single agents (Fig. 5D), suggesting that both induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation contribute to the
synergy between SM-164 and these TKIs. Interestingly, either
GSK or SKI had no major effect on TNFa expression or production (Supplementary Fig. S10B and S10C). Synergy was also
observed between SM-164 and GSK, PF or SKI in other MDAMB-231–resistant sublines (Supplementary Fig. S10D). No

of cyclin D1 and increase of PARP cleavage in the tumors
(Fig. 6A). We next determined the tumor growth inhibitory
activity of the combination. Although SM-164 or GSK
alone had a modest antitumor activity, their combination
effectively repressed tumor growth (Fig. 6B). Of note, the
T2-resistant tumors were very aggressive and one mouse
each from the vehicle control and SM-164 groups died of
complications of tumor invasion on days 7 and 9, respectively. The doses tested were well tolerated, and body weight
was not signiﬁcantly affected with the treatments (Supplementary Fig. S12B).

Discussion
Five Smac mimetics are being tested in the clinic as new
anticancer agents (1, 2). Preclinical studies showed that the
majority of cancer cell lines is resistant to Smac mimetics and
that the lack of TNFa production upon Smac mimetic treatment is the dominant mechanism of intrinsic resistance to
Smac mimetics (2, 7, 8, 12). Even when tumors initially respond
to Smac mimetics, they may subsequently acquire resistance.
Therefore, understanding resistant mechanisms of tumor
cells to Smac mimetics can guide the rational development
of Smac mimetics. In this study, using in vitro and in vivo
selected resistant models, we identiﬁed LRIG1 as a key regulator of resistance of tumor cells to Smac mimetics in breast
and ovarian cancer cell lines and showed that downregulation
of LRIG1 mediates Smac mimetic resistance through both
attenuation of Smac mimetic–induced TNFa production and
upregulation of RTKs.
LRIG1 is a negative regulator of RTKs by enhancing
receptor ubiquitination and degradation (18–22). Consistent with this notion, downregulation of LRIG1 is inversely
correlated with the upregulation of multiple RTKs in breast
and ovarian cancer cell lines (Fig. 5A, Supplementary
Fig. S8C). RTKs are promising targets for cancer treatment
based on their key roles in regulating critical cellular
processes; and aberrant RTK activation has been implicated in cancer resistance to molecular-targeted therapies
(32). It has been reported that combining a Smac mimetic
with inhibitors of PDGFR, IGF1R, or EGFR increases cell
death compared with monotherapy in human glioblastoma
multiforme (39). Synergy between Smac mimetics and
inhibitors of FLT3 and BCR-ABL was also observed against
leukemia in vitro and in vivo (40, 41). In breast cancer cells,
a Smac mimetic modestly increased apoptosis induction
by ErbB antagonists in Her2- or EGFR-overexpressing
cells (42). These data, coupled with our ﬁndings suggest
that combination of Smac mimetics with TKIs can be a
promising approach for the treatment of certain subtypes
of cancer.
We found that inhibition of multiple RTKs by TKIs, but
not the silencing of individual RTKs, signiﬁcantly enhances
the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231–resistant sublines to SM-164,
consistent with our observation that multiple RTKs are
upregulated in the SM-164–resistant cells. Importantly,
SM-164 in combination with GSK1363089 effectively inhib-

ited the tumor growth of Smac mimetic–resistant cells of
MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that TKIs can be used to
overcome or delay the emergence of Smac mimetic
resistance.
Smac mimetics induce activation of both canonical and
noncanonical NF-kB pathways, regardless of whether the
cells are sensitive or resistant to Smac mimetic–mediated
growth inhibition (9, 10). However, only Smac mimetics–
sensitive cells produce TNFa upon the activation of NF-kB,
resulting in apoptosis in an autocrine manner (9, 10). In our
studies, there is no signiﬁcant difference in the molecular
events of NF-kB activation between the sensitive and resistant sublines of MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). In Smac-mimetic–sensitive cells, knockdown of LRIG1
attenuated TNFa mRNA expression induced by Smac
mimetics, but not by TNFa or LPS, suggesting that manipulation of LRIG1 expression has minimal effect on classical
NF-kB activation. Indeed, knockdown of LRIG1 expression
had no signiﬁcant effect on SM-164–mediated activation
of canonical and noncanonical NF-kB pathways in MDAMB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Instead, our data
suggest that Smac mimetics induce TNFa expression
through a mechanism different from that of TNFa or LPS
and Smac mimetic–enhanced TNFa expression requires
de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 4). Additional studies are
needed to elucidate the precise mechanism of how LRIG1
regulates the TNFa expression induced by Smac mimetics.
Downregulation of LRIG1 leads to upregulation of multiple RTKs (Fig. 5A). It has been reported that activation of
RTKs such as Ron and Axl suppresses TNFa expression
in immune cells via downregulation of NF-kB activation
and/or upregulation of the transcription factor Twist
(43–45). However, we did not observe any signiﬁcant differences in the expression of either Twist1 or Twist2 between
parental cells, resistant and sensitive sublines of MDA-MB231.
Recently, the rebound of cIAP2 expression upon Smac
mimetic treatment of lung cancer cells was described as a
mechanism of Smac mimetic resistance (14). In our studies,
protein levels of cIAP2 and other key regulators of extrinsic
apoptotic pathways are not signiﬁcantly different between
sensitive and resistant sublines (Supplementary Fig. S8C1),
and cIAP2 was efﬁciently targeted by SM-164 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), suggesting the existence of more than one resistant
mechanism to Smac mimetics. Our ﬁndings that both the
in vivo and in vitro selected resistant cells from the MDAMB-231 cell line have a similar attribute of low LRIG1 expression suggesting that, in the bulk population of MDA-MB-231
cells, there is a small population of cells intrinsically resistant
to Smac mimetics.
In summary, our study has identiﬁed a novel mechanism of
Smac mimetics resistance and provided a basis for development of rational combination strategies to overcome such
resistance.
