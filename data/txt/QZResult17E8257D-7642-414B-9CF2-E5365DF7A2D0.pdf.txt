Abstract
The sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents varies according to circadian time. Most
chemotherapeutic agents ultimately cause cell death through cell-intrinsic pathways as an indirect consequence of DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor gene (TRP53) conﬁgures the cell deaths induced by
chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we show that the transcription factor ATF4, a component of the
mammalian circadian clock, functions in circadian accumulation of p53 protein in tumor cells. In murine
ﬁbroblast tumor cells, ATF4 induced the circadian expression of p19ARF (Cdkn2a). Oscillation of p19ARF
interacted in a time-dependent manner with MDM2, a speciﬁc ubiquitin ligase of p53, resulting in a rhythmic
prevention of its degradation by MDM2. Consequently, the half-life of p53 protein varied in a circadian timedependent manner without variation in mRNA levels. The p53 protein accumulated during those times when
the p19ARF–MDM2 interaction was facilitated. Notably, the ability of the p53 degradation inhibitor nutlin-3
to kill murine ﬁbroblast tumor cells was enhanced when the drug was administered at those times of day
during which p53 had accumulated. Taken together, these results suggested that ATF4-mediated regulation
of the p19ARF–MDM2 pathway underlies the circadian accumulation of p53 protein in malignant cells.
Furthermore, they suggest an explanation for how the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents
is enhanced at those times of day when p53 protein has accumulated, as a result of circadian processes
controlled by ATF4. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2639–49. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Daily rhythmic variations in biological functions are thought
to affect the efﬁcacy and/or toxicity of drugs: the potency of a
large number of drugs varies depending on the time of day
when the drugs are administered (1). It has been suggested that
administering drugs at appropriate times of day can improve
the outcome of pharmacotherapy by maximizing potency and
minimizing the toxicity of the drug, whereas administering
them at inappropriate times of day can induce severe side
effects (2). A chronopharmacological strategy can also improve
tumor response, overall survival, and dose-limiting toxicity in
cancer patients who are subjects in ongoing prospective
randomized clinical trials.

Circadian oscillations in biological function are associated with time-dependent changes in the efﬁcacy and/or
toxicity of many drugs. Recent molecular studies of the
circadian biological clock system have revealed that oscillations in the transcription of speciﬁc clock genes play a
central role in the generation of circadian rhythms (3–5). In
mammals, 24-hour rhythms in different tissues are coordinated by a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic
nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus. The master circadian
clock follows a daily light/dark cycle and, in turn, synchronizes subsidiary oscillators in other brain regions and many
peripheral tissues through neural and/or hormonal signals
(6–8). These subsidiary oscillators coordinate a variety of
biological processes, producing circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior.
p53 protects cells from uncontrolled growth through activating genes that induce cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, and
apoptotic cell death (9, 10). Because of its role in conserving
stability by preventing genome mutation, p53 is known as "the
guardian of the genome." Under nonstress conditions, the
protein levels of p53 are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin
ligase MDM2 at posttranscriptional level (11–13). When cells
are exposed to genotoxic stress such as chemotherapeutic
treatments, p53 proteins are rapidly accumulated via a decrease in their degradation (14). Although previous reports
show that the protein levels of p53 exhibit a signiﬁcant circadian oscillation in the human oral epithelium and mouse
tissues (15, 16), it remains to be clariﬁed whether the oscillation

of p53 protein levels affects the susceptibility of tumor cells to
chemotherapeutic agents.
Activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP response
element (CRE)-binding (CREB) proteins induce the CREmediated gene transcription depending on the cAMP stimulation. Extensive activation of cAMP-dependent signaling is
often observed in malignant tumor cells, which probably
contributes to abnormal cell proliferation. cAMP-dependent
signaling oscillates in a circadian time-dependent manner,
which in turn also sustains core oscillation machinery of the
circadian clock (17). Among the ATF/CREB family proteins,
ATF4 constitutes a molecular link connecting cAMP-dependent signaling to the circadian clock (18). In this study, we
showed that ATF4 caused the circadian accumulation of
p53 protein in tumor cells. ATF4 repressed the expression
of p19ARF in a circadian time-dependent manner; the
oscillation of p19ARF resulted in periodic prevention of
MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 protein. We thus investigated how the circadian accumulation of p53 protein
affects the susceptibility of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic
agents.

Materials and Methods
Animals and cells
Male Balb/c Nu/Nu mice were purchased from Charles
River. Heterozygous Atf4-null (Atf4þ/) mice were provided
by Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The animals
were housed in a temperature-controlled (24  1 C) room
under a 12-hour light : 12-hour dark cycle. Under the light/dark
cycle, zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 was designated as lights on and
ZT12 as lights off. The animals were cared in accordance with
the guidelines established by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyushu University (Fukuoka, Japan).
Mouse ﬁbroblast-like tumor cell lines UV.BAL-5.4G
(RCB2025) were provided by RIKEN Bio Resource Center
(Tsukuba, Japan). The cells are established by UV irradiation,
and were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented 10% FBS at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. The tumor cell lines expressed
wild-type p53 protein (Supplementary Fig. S1). To assess the
circadian oscillation of p53 expression in cultured cells, semiconﬂuent cultured UV.BAL-5.4G cells were stimulated with 10
nmol/L dexamethasone (DEX) for 2 hours; the medium was
then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Cells
were harvested for extraction of protein or RNA at the indicated times after DEX stimulation. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were prepared by standard techniques from
embryos of wild-type or Atf4-null (Atf4/) mice, and cells
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 20
mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, and 1 nonessential amino acid
mix. For oncogenic transformation, MEFs were infected with
retroviral vectors expressing H-rasV12 and SV40LT (19).
Balb/c Nu/Nu mice were inoculated with UV.BAL-5.4G
(2  107 cells/mouse) or oncogenic-transformed MEFs
(2.5  106 cells/mouse). Tumor volume was measured as
described previously (19), and tumor-bearing mice were used
for each experiment after the tumor volume reached at 200
mm3.

Determination of p53 protein stability
To determine the stability of p53 protein in cultured UV.
BAL-5.4G cells, 50 mg/mL of cycloheximide (CHX) was added to
media and cell lysates were prepared at selected time intervals.
Cells were lysed in 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mmol/L
NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with
protease inhibitor mixtures and proteasome inhibitor (100
nmol/L; MG132). To investigate the time-dependent difference
in the stability of p53 protein in vivo, tumor masses formed by
oncogenic wild-type or Atf4/ cells were removed from
tumor-bearing mice at ZT2 and ZT14, and single-cell suspension was prepared by standard methods (19). Cells were
incubated in the presence of 50 mg/mL of CHX. After incubation, nuclear fractions were extracted using NE-PER Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology),
and they were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibodies
(PAb246; Calbiochem). The precipitants were analyzed by
Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (sc
6243; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).
Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared from tumor masses or cultured
cells were extracted as described earlier. The protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce
Biotechnology). The lysate samples were separated on 5%, 10%,
or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. The membranes were reacted
with antibodies against p53 (sc-6243), ATF4 (sc-200), p19ARF
(sc-22784), MDM2 (sc-812), or ACTIN (sc-1616). These antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antiglutathion S-transferase (GST) antibodies (Wako Co., Ltd.)
were used to detect recombinant GST-fused p53 (rGST-p53)
protein. The immunocomplexes were further reacted with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. The
membranes were photographed and the density of each band
was analyzed by using LAS4000 mini (Fiji ﬁlm).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using RNAiso reagent (Takara Co.,
Ltd.). The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by
reverse transcribing 0.4 mg of RNA using a ReverTra Ace qPCR
RT kit (Toyobo). The cDNA equivalent of 12 ng of RNA was
ampliﬁed by PCR in a real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Sequences for PCR primers are
described in Supplementary Table S1.
Vector construction
Speciﬁc silencing of the endogenous Atf4 in tumor cells was
achieved by using a shRNA-expressing retrovirus vector.
Nucleotides 1114–1132 of the mouse Atf4 (NM_009716) coding
sequence were chosen as the target for shRNA. The Atf4shRNA–encoding oligonucleotides were created as indicated
below, each containing the 19-nucleotide target sequence of
Atf4, followed by a short spacer and an antisense sequence of
the target: 50 -GAGCATTCCTTTAGTTTAGAGAGCTCACCCTAAACTAAAGGAA-TGCTC-30 . The Atf4-shRNA–encoding
sequence was cloned into the BamHI and BglII sites of the
pDON-AI2 vector (Takara) and transfected into G3T-hi

packaging cells. All the infected cells were cultured in a
medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. The control
shRNA-expressing retrovirus vector was made using the same
procedure, but with the following oligonucleotide sequence
50 -GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAGAGCTCACCGAACTTCAGGGTCAGCTTGC-30 . Expression vectors for mouse ATF4 were
also constructed using cDNAs obtained from RT-PCR derived
from mouse hepatic RNA. Coding regions were ligated into the
pcDNA3.1 (þ) vector (Invitrogen).
Small interfering RNA
Oncogenic transformed Atf4/ cells were transfected with
siRNA against p19Arf (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This siRNA
is designed to prevent the expression of p19ARF, and the
downregulation efﬁcacy was conﬁrmed in previous studies
(19). On day 7 after oncogene introduction, cells were transfected with siRNA (20 nmol/L) and used for experiments at 48
hours after transfection.
Determination of the binding capacity of MDM2 to p53
protein
Tumor masses formed by oncogenic wild-type or Atf4/
cells were removed from tumor-bearing mice at ZT2 and ZT14.
The masses were homogenized in a lysis buffer as described
earlier. Equal amounts of cell lysates (1 mg protein) were
precleared with 30 mL of protein G-Sepharose beads. After
precleaning, 1 mg anti-p19ARF antibodies (sc-32748; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 mL protein G-sepharose beads
were added into lysates, and the mixtures were incubated for
12 hours at 4 C. The beads and supernatants were separated by
centrifugation. The beads were washed 3 times with washing
buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. After addition of
rGST-p53 protein into the supernatants (1 mg/mL), the mixtures were further immunoprecipitated with anti-MDM2 antibodies (sc-965; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described earlier.
The cell lysates, supernatants, and immunoprecipitations were
analyzed by 5%, 10%, or 15% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against p53 (sc-6243), p19ARF (sc22784), or MDM2 (sc-812).
Determination of cytotoxicity
Tumor masses formed by UV.BAL-5.4G or oncogenictransformed wild-type and Atf4/ cells were removed from
tumor-bearing mice at ZT2 or ZT14. Single-cell suspensions
were prepared by standard methods (19). Cell suspensions
were mixed with 100 mmol/L nutlin-3, 500 mmol/L bleomycin, or 1 mmol/L dacarbazine, and thereafter seeded on 24well plate. At 2 hours after seeding, we conﬁrmed attachment of cells on the well bottom. The culture medium was
replaced to drug-free medium, and cells were incubated for
indicated times. The dosage of drugs was selected based on
previous reports (20–23). A signiﬁcant antitumor effect of
nutlin-3 is observed in mice when they were administered
orally with the drug at the dosage of 200 mg/kg (20). Oral
administration of the same dosage of nutlin-3 into mice
results in peak plasma concentration at 100 mmol/L (21).
Similar reason was also applicable in both cases of bleomycin and dacarbazine (22, 23). The viable cells were detected

www.aacrjournals.org

by staining with 5 mmol/L calcein-AM. Cell viability was
determined by using a microscope to count viable cells. The
number of viable cells just after treatment with drugs (0
hour) was set at 100.
Immunohistochemical analysis
The viable cells were stained with 5 mmol/L calcein-AM.
After staining with calcein-AM, cells were ﬁxed with 4% (w/
v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, and thereafter treated with 10% normal sheep serum for 1 hour. Cells
were incubated with the rabbit anti-p53 antibodies (sc-6243;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 C for 24 hours. After washing
with cold PBS, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG
Cy3-conjugated antibodies (Sigma) for 12 hours. The viable
and p53 positive cells were detected under a 20 objective
lens.
Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences among groups was
determined by ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni comparisons.
A 5% probability was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
ATF4 regulates the stability of p53 protein through the
ARF–MDM2 pathway
We showed previously that the protein levels of p53 were
signiﬁcantly higher in oncogenic Atf4/ cells than in normal
cells (19). To investigate the role of ATF4 in the expression of
p53 in malignant tumor cells, the levels of p53 protein and its
mRNA were assessed in ATF4-downregulated tumor cells. In
this experiment, UV.BAL-5.4G cells were used because of
excessive ATF4 expression (data not shown). Infection of
UV.BAL-5.4G with retrovirus vector-expressing shRNA targeting Atf4 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ATF4
protein expression (Fig. 1A, top). Downregulation of ATF4
signiﬁcantly increased the protein levels of p53, but had little
effect on its mRNA levels (Fig. 1A, bottom), suggesting that
ATF4 regulates protein levels of p53 in tumor cells without
induction of its mRNA expression.
To investigate the possibility that ATF4 regulates the expression of p53 protein at posttranscriptional level, we explored the
stability of p53 protein in ATF4-downregulated tumor cells.
UV.BAL-5.4G cells were infected with Atf4 shRNA- or control
shRNA-expressing retrovirus vectors. Then 50 mg/mL of CHX
was added to the media, and cell lysates were prepared at
selected time intervals. In control shRNA-infected cells, the
half-life of p53 protein was approximately 0.65 hours (Fig. 1B).
However, the half-life in Atf4 shRNA-infected cells was prolonged about 9-fold (5.9 hours). A deﬁciency in ATF4 in
malignant tumor cells seems to induce the stabilization of
p53 protein.
The stability of p53 protein is mainly regulated by its
phosphorylation and interaction with speciﬁc ubiquitin ligases
MDM2, which promote p53 protein ubiquitination and its
proteasomal degradation (11–13). Although p19ARF (also
known as p14ARF in humans) also stabilizes p53 by sequestering MDM2 (11), the levels of both p19ARF mRNA and its
protein were signiﬁcantly increased in ATF4-downregulated

p19ARF is involved in the regulation of p53 protein stability by
ATF4.
To further evaluate the role of p19ARF in the regulation of
the stability of p53 protein by ATF4, we assessed the protein
levels of p53 and p19ARF in oncogenic Atf4/ cells. MEFs were
prepared from embryos of wild-type or Atf4/ mice, and
infected with retroviral vectors expressing H-rasV12 and
SV40LT for oncogenic transformation (19). As compared to
wild-type oncogenic cells, the protein levels of both p53 and
p19ARF were obviously abundant in oncogenic Atf4/ cells
(Fig. 1D). The elevated levels of both p53 and p19ARF proteins
in Atf4/ oncogenic cells were decreased by overexpression
of ATF4 (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, the levels of p53 protein in
Atf4/ oncogenic cells were also decreased by downregulation of p19ARF (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results suggest
that ATF4 affects the stability of p53 protein by repressing the
expression of p19ARF.

ATF4 is required for circadian accumulation of p53
protein in tumor cells
The expression of p53 protein in the thymuses of mice
exhibits circadian oscillation (16). In this study, we also found
a signiﬁcant circadian accumulation of p53 protein in UV.BAL5.4G tumor cells implanted in mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A, top). The
circadian accumulation of p53 protein was occurred without
rhythmic change in its mRNA expression (Fig. 2A, bottom). A
similar time-dependent accumulation of p53 protein was also
detected in cultured UV.BAL-5.4G cells whose circadian clocks
were synchronized by DEX treatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting that
the oscillation in the expression of p53 protein is cell
autonomous.
ATF4 acts not only as a regulator of p53 protein levels, but
also as a component of the mammalian circadian clock (18). To
investigate whether ATF4 regulates the circadian accumulation of p53 protein, we assessed the temporal expression
proﬁles of p53 in tumor masses formed by oncogenic wild-

type or Atf4/ cells. As compared with wild-type tumor cells,
the p53 protein levels in Atf4/ tumor cells increased at both
ZT2 and ZT14, but the protein levels did not show a signiﬁcant
time-dependent variation (Fig. 3A). Because there was no
signiﬁcant time-dependent oscillation of p53 mRNA levels in
both wild-type and Atf4/ tumor cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2), ATF4 seems to regulate the circadian accumulation of p53
protein at posttranscriptional level.
To test this possibility, we explored whether ATF4 induces a
circadian change in the stability of p53 protein in tumor cells.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the levels of p53 protein in wild-type tumor
masses prepared at ZT2 were low. We thus conducted immunoprecipitation by using 2 types of anti-p53 antibodies to
detect low levels of p53 protein. In the wild-type tumor cells,
the half-life of p53 proteins varied depending on the time of
their preparation. The half-life of p53 protein in wild-type
tumor cells prepared at ZT2 was much shorter than that of
p53 protein in cells prepared at ZT14 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the
half-life of p53 protein in Atf4/ tumor cells was considerably
longer than that from wild-type cells, but the time of preparation did not cause signiﬁcant differences in the half-life of
p53 protein in Atf4/ tumor cells (Fig. 3B). These results
suggest that circadian accumulation of p53 protein in wildtype tumor cells is associated with the time-dependent change
in its stability; the circadian change in that stability is caused by
ATF4.

ATF4 regulates the circadian change in the p53 protein
stability through the p19ARF–MDM2 pathway
MDM2 protein in UV.BAL-5.4G tumor masses was constantly expressed throughout the day, whereas the levels of both
ATF4 and p19ARF proteins in the tumor masses exhibited
obvious circadian oscillations (Fig. 4A, top). The accumulation
of p19ARF varied almost inversely with ATF4 protein expression. The levels of p19Arf mRNA in UV.BAL-5.4G tumor masses
showed a signiﬁcant circadian oscillation, with higher levels
from the late light phase to the early dark phase (P < 0.05; Fig.
4A, bottom). Similar signiﬁcant time-dependent expression of
p19ARF was also detected in wild-type tumors (P < 0.05; Fig.
4B). However, neither p19ARF mRNA nor protein showed
signiﬁcant time-dependent oscillation in the Atf4/ cell
tumor masses. The protein levels of p19ARF was elevated at
both time points, suggesting that constant elevation of p19ARF
in Atf4/ cells may prevent the circadian change in the MDM2
binding to p53 protein.
MDM2 promotes the degradation of p53 protein by functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The ubiquitination occurs
through binding of MDM2 to the transactivation domain of the
p53 protein (11–13). To investigate the circadian time dependency of the binding ability of MDM2 to p53 protein, we
conducted immunoprecipitation experiment as shown
in Fig. 4C. The protein levels of p53 in wild-type tumor cells
prepared at ZT14 were approximately 4-fold higher than those

at ZT2 (Fig. 3A). Such large difference in p53 contents could
hinder accurate comparison of the binding capacity of MDM2
to p53 between the 2 times. We thus added constant amount of
rGST-p53 protein in tumor cell lysates and evaluated the
binding capacity of MDM2 to exogenous p53 protein. The
results of immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MDM2
protein in wild-type tumor cells precipitated together with
p19ARF in a circadian time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C, IP:
p19ARF). The amount of MDM2 associated with p19ARF was
greater at ZT14 compared with that at ZT2. Consequently,
much amount of p19ARF-unbound MDM2 remained in supernatants prepared from ZT2 of wild-type tumor cell lysates (Fig.
4C, Supernatant A). The p19ARF-unbound MDM2 in wild-type
tumor cells precipitated together with rGST-p53 in a circadian
time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C, IP: MDM2). The amount of
rGST-p53 associated with MDM2 was greater at ZT2 compared
to that at ZT14.
In Atf4/ tumor cells, most of p19ARF in Atf4/ tumor cell
lysates precipitated with anti-p19ARF antibody, but substantial amount of p19ARF-unbound MDM2 still remained in the
supernatants (Fig. 4C, Supernatant A). The p19ARF-unbound
MDM2 in the supernatants prepared from Atf4/ cells could
be associated with rGST-p53, but the association between
MDM2 and rGST-p53 did not exhibit the time-dependent
variation (Fig. 4C, IP: MDM2). These results suggest that the
time-dependent interaction between p19ARF and MDM2
underlies circadian change in the binding capacity of MDM2
to p53 protein. Constant interaction between p19ARF and
MDM2 in Atf4/ tumor cells may prevent the circadian
oscillation of MDM2 binding to p53 protein.

ATF4 forms heterodimers with C/EBPa that act to repress
p19Arf gene transcription through the C/EBP-ATF response
element (CARE; ref. 19). The CARE sequence is located between
6263 and 6255 with respect to the transcriptional start site
of the p19Arf gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that the amount of ATF4 binding to CARE within the
p19Arf 50 -ﬂanking region varied time dependently (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that ATF4 periodically
suppresses the expression of p19Arf mRNA, thereby causing
the circadian oscillation in its protein levels.
Dosing time-dependent change in the cytotoxicity of
chemotherapeutic agents
Because the p53 protein levels in UV.BAL-5.4G and oncogenic wild-type tumor cells oscillated in a circadian timedependent manner, we investigated whether that oscillation
affects the cytotoxic effect of chemotheraputic agents. Several
studies have showed that the dosing time-dependent change in
the cytotoxicity of chemotheraputic agents is associated not
only with circadian oscillation in the sensitivity of tumor cells
to the drugs but also with their pharmacokinetics (24–25). To
exclude the inﬂuence of circadian change in the distribution of
drugs into the tumor cells, single-cell suspensions were
prepared from UV.BAL-5.4G tumor masses at ZT2 and ZT14
(Fig. 5A). Cells were treated with chemotheraputic agents, and
p53 protein levels and cell viability were determined at indicated times.
At 8 hours after treatment with nutlin-3, a potent inhibitor
of p53 degradation, the number of p53-positive cells and
their signal intensity were obviously increased, but the

accumulation of p53 protein was greater when cells were
treated with nutlin-3 at ZT14 (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the
dosing time dependency of p53 accumulation, induction in the
expression of p53 target genes, Bax, p21, Noxa, and Puma was
also signiﬁcantly enhanced in cells treated with nutlin-3 at
ZT14 (P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 5C). These ﬁndings suggest
that the growth-suppressive properties of p53 are changed
according to the dosing time of nutlin-3. In fact, the cytotoxic
effect of nutlin-3 on UV.BAL-5.4G tumor cells also varied
signiﬁcantly depending on the time when the cells were treated
(Fig. 5D, left). The effect in cells prepared at ZT 14 was greater
than in cells prepared at ZT2. Similar dosing time dependency

bleomycin and dacarbazine (Fig. 5D, middle and right panels).
The cytotoxic effect of these drugs was enhanced at the time of

In the ﬁnal set of experiment, we investigated whether ATF4
was involved in the dosing time-dependent change in the cytotoxic effect of nutlin-3. To this end, cell viability was assessed in

Discussion
The molecular circadian clock operates at a cellular level and
governs a wide variety of physiologic processes. This study
suggests that this clockwork governs the time-dependent
accumulation of p53 protein in tumor cells. In mammals,
circadian rhythmicity in various biological processes is controlled by a molecular pacemaker composed of clock gene
products (26–28). These gene products constitute an oscillating mechanism based on self-sustained transcriptional/translational feedback loops. The Clock gene encodes the CLOCK
transcription factor, which dimerizes with BMAL1 to activate
the transcription of Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes
via E-box or E-box-like enhancer sequences (4, 29). Once PER
and CRY proteins have reached critical concentrations, they
attenuate CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation, thereby generating
circadian oscillation in their own transcription. In addition,
CLOCK/BMAL1, PER, and CRY proteins regulate the expression of ATF4, which in turn sustains the transcriptional
oscillation of Bmal1, Per2, and Cry1 gene (18). This mechanism
interconnects the positive and negative limbs of circadian
clockwork circuitry and also regulates 24-hour variation in
output physiology through the periodic activation/repression
of clock-controlled output genes (30). ATF4 also acts as an
output component of the circadian clock and regulates the
rhythmic expression of its target genes through the CRE (31).
In murine ﬁbroblast tumor cells, ATF4 functioned as a
circadian regulator of p19ARF expression, causing a timedependent interaction between p19ARF and MDM2, which
resulted in periodic prevention of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Consequently, the half-life of p53 protein varied in a
circadian time-dependent manner; the proteins accumulated

www.aacrjournals.org

during those times of day when p19ARF–MDM2 interaction
was facilitated (Fig. 7). In contrast, the p53 mRNA levels in
tumor cells failed to exhibit a signiﬁcant circadian oscillation,
suggesting that the molecular clock regulates the circadian
expression of p53 protein at posttranscriptional level. In fact,
the abundance of p53 protein in Atf4/ tumor cells increased
consistently throughout the day without a corresponding
increase in mRNA levels.
In this study, we used retrovirus vectors expressing SV40LT
as a transforming agent, together with H-rasV12. Because
SV40LT inactivates p53 and prevents the phosphorylation of
Rb by protein–protein interaction (32, 33), inactivation of the
growth-suppressive properties of p53 has been shown to be
essential for immortalization of MEFs by SV40LT. In fact, p53
protein in oncogene-introduced wild-type cells was precipitated together with SV40LT (Supplementary Fig. S4). However,
substantial amount of SV40LT-unbound p53 protein still
existed in wild-type cells, suggesting that extensive expression
of p53 in oncogene-introduced cells overrides the binding
capacity of SV40LT. Concomitant introduced H-rasV1 may also
enhance the accumulation of p53 protein through DNA damage response. The SV40LT-unbound p53 protein in wild-type
cells seemed to be involved in the circadian regulation of tumor
cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.
Because cells deﬁcient in p53 exhibit resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (34, 35), we explored whether the oscillation
of p53 protein levels affects the susceptibility of tumor cells to
chemotherapeutic agents. Nutlin is a cis-imidazoline analog
that mimics 3 residues (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26) in the helical
region of p530 s transactivation domain, residues that are
conserved across species and that are critical for binding to

conventional chemotherapeutic agents, bleomycin and decarbazine, were also enhanced by applying the drugs at the
times of day during which accumulation of p53 protein was
facilitated in tumor cells. Because there was no signiﬁcant
dosing time-dependent difference in the cytotoxic effect of
nutlin-3 on oncogenic Atf4/ cells, ATF4-mediated regulation
of the ARF–MDM2 pathway could cause a circadian accumulation of p53 protein, thereby causing the time-dependent
change in the susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents.
The amount of p53 protein in oncogene-introduced Atf4/
cells not only failed to show circadian variation, but also was
greater than that in wild-type cells. This may be because of a
decrease in the degradation of p53 through MDM2-mediated
proteasomal pathway. Although the protein levels of p19ARF
were elevated in Atf4/ cells, MDM2 was not completely
entrapped by p19ARF. The p19ARF-unbound MDM2 in
Atf4/ cells still had a capacity to bind to p53 protein.
Nutlin-3 seemed to prevent the interaction between
p19ARF-unbound MDM2 and p53 protein, resulting in severe
cytotoxic effect on Atf4/ cells.
The effectiveness and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents
vary with the dosing time. However, many drugs are still
administered without regard to the time of day. Identiﬁcation
of the mechanism underlying the dosing time dependency of
chemotherapeutic agents should help achieve better chronopharmacotherapy for treatment of cancers.
Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest
No potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed.
Figure 7. Schematic mechanism of the circadian accumulation of p53
protein in tumor cells. ATF4 induced the circadian expression of p19ARF;
the oscillation of p19ARF protein interacted time-dependently with
MDM2, resulting in periodic repression of MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation
and degradation of p53 protein. Consequently, p53 proteins accumulate
during those times of day when p19ARF-MDM2 interaction was
facilitated. The circadian accumulation of p53 protein seems to cause a
time-dependent increase in the sensitivity of cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents.

MDM2. Nutlin binds to MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket and
stabilizes the p53 protein (20). The stabilization of p53 leads to
cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and growth inhibition of tumor
cells including myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(36). Nutlin-3 also exhibited a signiﬁcant cytotoxic effect on
murine ﬁbroblast tumor cells, but the effect on wild-type cells
varied according to its dosing time. The cytotoxic effect of
nutlin-3 on wild-type cells was further enhanced by applying
the drug to cells prepared at the early dark phase (ZT14).
During this circadian phase, p53 protein was more accumulated after nutlin-3 treatment. The dosing time-dependent
difference in nutlin-3–induced p53 accumulation seems to
cause a circadian change in the sensitivity of cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents. In fact, the cytotoxic effects of
