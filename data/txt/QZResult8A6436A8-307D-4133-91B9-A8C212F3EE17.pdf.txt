ABSTRACT
Although imatinib mesylate (IM) has revolutionized the management of
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), drug resistance remains a challenge.
Previous studies have shown that the expression of aurora kinase A (AURKA)
predicts recurrence in patients with primary, surgically resected GISTs. The current
study aimed to evaluate the significance of AURKA expression as an unfavorable
prognostic marker for advanced GISTs, and provide evidence that AURKA could be a
potential therapeutic target in GISTs. The prognostic significance of the expression
of AURKA, along with other clinicopathological factors, was analyzed in a cohort of 99
IM-treated patients with advanced GISTs. The potential use of an inhibitor of AURKA
as a therapeutic agent against GISTs was also tested in GIST cell lines. Among 99
enrolled patients, poor performance status, large tumor size, drug response, and
AURKA overexpression were independent prognostic factors for poor progressionfree survival (PFS). For overall survival (OS), only large tumor size and AURKA
overexpression were identified as independent unfavorable factors. In an in vitro
study, MLN8237, an AURKA inhibitor, inhibited growth of both IM-sensitive and
IM-resistant GIST cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and exhibited
synergistic cytotoxicity with IM in GIST cells. The inhibitory effect of MLN8237 in GIST
cells could be attributed to the induction of G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and senescence.

Our study shows that AURKA expression independently predicted poor PFS and OS
in patients with advanced GISTs who were treated with IM. An AURKA inhibitor may
have potential as a therapeutic agent for both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant GISTs.

independent poor prognostic marker for GIST recurrence
[17, 18]. However, no data are available regarding the
significance of AURKA expression in predicting the
prognosis of advanced GISTs. Moreover, it is not clear
whether AURKA could be a potential therapeutic target
in this type of cancer. This study aimed to address these
two issues.

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the
most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal
tract. These tumors occur most frequently in the stomach
(~50%) and small intestine (25%−35%), and less
frequently in the colorectal region (10%−12%), omentum/
mesentery (7%), and esophagus (1%−5%) [1–3]. GISTs
are thought to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal
(ICC) [4]. The ICC, which are associated with Auerbach’s
plexus, are innervated cells that have an autonomous
pacemaker function and coordinate peristalsis throughout
the gastrointestinal tract.
Most GISTs contain mutations in the gene encoding
the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor [5], but less than 10%
have mutations in the gene encoding the alpha polypeptide
of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA)
as the oncogenic driving force [6]. With the development
of imatinib mesylate (IM; Novartis Pharmaceuticals,
Basel, Switzerland), a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) that inhibits both KIT and PDGFRA, the median
overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced GISTs
has improved from less than one year in the pre-TKI era
to five to six years. However, acquired resistance to IM
is inevitable and occurs within two to three years after
treatment [7, 8]. The development of resistance is most
likely due to resistance-associated mutations [9–11]. For
IM-resistant GISTs, the therapeutic options are limited
to a few other TKIs such as sunitinib maleate (Pfizer,
New York, USA)[12] and regorafenib (BAY 73-4506;
Bayer Schering Pharmaceuticals AG, Berlin, Germany)
[13]. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify new
biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets that can be used to
treat these patients.
For localized GISTs, several criteria have been
proposed to predict the risk of recurrence. These include
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus and
modified consensus criteria [14, 15] and the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria [16]. Among them,
the mitotic rate is one of the most important risk factors.
In a previous study, we re-analyzed available expression
profiling data of GISTs and determined that gene sets
associated with cell cycle progression or its regulation
were strongly associated with the risk of recurrence [17].
Lagarde et al. also successfully predicted metastasis in
67 primary untreated GISTs [18] by using a prognostic
gene expression signature composed of 67 genes related
to chromosome integrity, mitotic control, and genome
complexity in sarcomas (Complexity INdex in SARComa,
or CINSARC) [19]. Both we and Lagarde et al. identified
the expression of aurora kinase A (AURKA) as an

RESULTS
High AURKA expression is an independent poor
prognostic factor for advanced GISTs
A total of 99 patients with advanced GISTs were
enrolled, and their clinicopathological characteristics
are summarized in Supplemental Table 1. The mean age
of these patients, who were predominantly men, was
57.8 years. Over 80% of the patients had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0–1. The small bowel was the most common site
(50 of 99; 50.5%), followed by the stomach (37 of 99;
37.4%) and the colon/rectum (8 of 99; 8.1%). The median
tumor size (as defined in the PATIENTS AND METHODS
section) before treatment with IM was 10.0 cm (range,
2.5–181.0 cm). Genomic analysis was done in 92 cases.
Most of the tumors (69.6%) contained mutations in exon
11, some (18.5%) harbored mutations in exon 9, and the
remainder (12.0%) were wild type or had mutations in
other genes.
The median follow-up time after IM treatment was
33.6 months (range, 1.6–110.9 months). For all patients, the
median progression-free survival (PFS) was 37.6 months
and the median OS was 71.0 months. Univariate analysis
showed that the PFS of all 99 patients was significantly
influenced by age, ECOG performance status, tumor size,
platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level,
AURKA expression level, and treatment response. In
the multivariate analysis, however, only high AST level,
tumor size greater than 11.5 cm, poor drug response, and
AURKA overexpression were identified as independent
prognostic factors for poor PFS (Table 1). The KaplanMeier PFS curve for AURKA expression is shown in
Figure 1B, and those for the other three factors are shown
in Supplemental Figure S1.
Univariate analysis showed that the OS of all 99
patients was also significantly influenced by age, ECOG
performance status, tumor size, platelet count, AST
level, AURKA expression level, and treatment response
in addition to albumin and sodium levels (Table 2).
However, only tumor size larger than 11.5 cm and
AURKA overexpression were identified as independent

days demonstrated that this compound caused marked
accumulation of cells at G2/M as well as >4N DNA
content in all three GIST cell lines (Figure 3).
We next analyzed the effect of MLN8237 on
the p53 pathway. As shown in Figure 4, treatment
with this compound dose-dependently up-regulated
the expression of p21 in all three GIST cell lines. In
GIST48 and GIST430 cells, there was also a dosedependent ­up-regulation of p53 expression. GIST882
is a p53-negative cell line. (Figure 4). These findings
indicate that treatment with MLN8237 can increase the
expression of p21 and/or p53, which may contribute to
cell cycle arrest in GIST cell lines.

MLN8237 inhibits AURKA and induces mitotic
arrest in GIST cell lines
We used an in vitro model to test the possible use
of AURKA as a therapeutic target in GISTs. MLN8237
is a potent inhibitor of AURKA that reduces the activity
of AURKA in a variety of cancers [20–22]. We examined
whether MLN8237 inhibits the activation of AURKA
in GIST cells. Cell division in cultured GIST cells was
first synchronized by exposing the cells to nocodazole
for 16 hours. The cells were then treated with MLN8237
for 56 hours, after which phosphorylation of AURKA at
threonine 288 (pThr288) was measured by western blotting.
Decreased phosphorylation of AURKA was detected in
all MLN8237-treated GIST cells (Figure 2A). We also
demonstrated that all GIST cell lines treated with MLN8237
exhibited a dose-dependent increase in phosphorylation of
Histone H3 (phospho-Histone H3; pHisH3) at serine 10
(pSer10), an indicator of mitotic arrest [23](Figure 2B).

MLN8237 exerts a cytotoxic effect by inducing
apoptosis in both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant
GIST cell lines and acts synergistically with IM
We examined whether MLN8237 could exhibit
cytotoxic activity against GIST cell lines. As shown
in Figure 5, MLN8237 displayed cytotoxicity against
both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant GIST cells when
assessed by an MTT assay (Figure 5A), or by a trypan
blue exclusion assay (Figure 5B). A significant induction
of apoptosis in GIST cell lines was also detected by
co-staining with propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Annexin V (Annexin
V-FITC) (Figure 5C).
We then explored the possible synergistic effects
of treatment with both MLN8237 and IM by using
a combination index (CI) assay [24]. A CI value <1
is defined as synergy. As shown in Figure 6, treating

MLN8237 induces G2/M arrest in GIST
cell lines with concomitant up-regulation
of p21 and/or p53
Because AURKA is a cell cycle regulatory protein,
we then explored the effects of MLN8237 on cell cycle
progression in GIST cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis

with an anti-phospho-Aurora A (Thr288) antibody revealed inhibition of AURKA autophosphorylation in GIST cell lines synchronized by
exposure to nocodazole and then treated with MLN8237. (B) Immunoblotting of three AURKA-expressing GIST cell lines with an antiphospho-HistoneH3 (Ser10) (pHisH3) antibody revealed a dose-dependent induction of pHisH3 after treatment with MLN8237 for six days.

Figure 3: MLN8237 induces G2/M arrest in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cell lines. The DNA profiles of GIST882, GIST48, and

GIST430 cells treated with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or MLN8237 for six days were evaluated by flow cytometry. The percentages of
cells in the sub-G1, G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases, as well as the percentage of cells with a DNA content >4N are shown in different colors.

GIST882 cells with different doses of MLN8237 and a
fixed dose of IM revealed that MLN8237 did not synergize
with IM except at a relatively high dose. On the other hand,
in GIST48 and GIST430 cells, synergy between MLN8237
and IM was observed at all doses tested. These results
indicate that MLN8237 can act synergistically with IM in
GIST cells, especially in those resistant to IM.

cells following treatment with MLN8237, a senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay was performed

profiling data of GISTs) [17] and Lagarde et al. (by using
the CINSARC signature) [18] have determined that genes
involved in the progression or regulation of the cell cycle
were strongly associated with the risk of GISTs recurrence.
Most interestingly, the findings of Shan et al., our group,
and Lagarde et al. highlight the important role of AURKA
in the pathogenesis of ULMS and GISTs [17, 18, 27].
AURKA plays a key role in the regulation of cell
cycle progression [28]. This protein is overexpressed in
a wide range of tumors and is considered an unfavorable
prognostic factor [29–32]. In addition, the ability of
AURKA to transform has also been shown in several
types of cells [33]. Most importantly, several inhibitors
of AURKA are currently being tested in clinical-phase
studies [34]. Therefore, we investigated the potential of
AURKA inhibitors for use as therapeutic agents in the
treatment of GISTs.
MLN8237 is an AURKA inhibitor whose antitumor activity has been confirmed in a variety of cancers
[20–22, 35]; furthermore, it has been tested in phase I
clinical trials [36, 37]. In this study, we demonstrated that
MLN8237 inhibited activation of AURKA (Figure 2A)
with resultant mitotic inhibition, as reflected by increased
expression of pHisH3 [23] (Figure 2B) in all three cell
lines tested. In addition, we found that incubating GIST
cells with MLN8237 consistently induced G2/M cell
cycle arrest (Figure 3). Our study also revealed the ability
of MLN8237 to inhibit cell growth and proliferation,
as well as induce apoptosis, in both IM-sensitive and
IM-resistant GIST cells (Figure 5). Finally, MLN8237
exerted synergistic cytotoxicity with IM in GIST
cells (Figure 6). These findings are similar to those of
investigators studying other types of tumors [20–22]. It
is interesting to note that the cytotoxicity of MLN8237
could only be detected after six days of treatment. One
possible explanation for this finding is that the doubling
time of GIST cell lines is relatively longer than that of
other sarcoma cell lines. It is also interesting to note that
MLN8237 treatment up-regulated the expression of p21

in GIST48 cells after being treated with MLN8237 for
six days. MLN8237 treatment significantly increased
SA-β-gal activity in GIST cells (Figure 7A and 7B).
Furthermore, administration of MLN8237 also increased
the expression of DEC1 (Figure 7C) and DcR2 (Figure
7D), two well-known senescence biomarkers [25, 26], in
a dose-dependent manner, while the levels of phospho-p70
S6 kinase remained steady. As measured by quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR), the expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a cytokine
associated with the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) [25, 26], was also up-regulated
in GIST48 cells treated with MLN8237 (Figure 7E).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that MLN8237
treatment induces senescence in GIST cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that overexpression of AURKA
was an independent poor prognostic factor for both PFS
and OS among 99 patients with advanced GISTs who were
treated with IM. In in vitro assays, the AURKA inhibitor
MLN8237 inhibited the growth of both IM-sensitive and
IM-resistant GIST cells in a concentration-dependent manner
and exerted synergistic cytotoxicity with IM. The inhibitory
effect of MLN8237 on GIST cells could be attributed to the
induction of G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and senescence.
In the past few years, several studies have shown that
genes involved in cell cycle regulation are important in the
pathogenesis of sarcoma. Chibon et al. have established
that CINSARC, a gene expression signature composed of
67 genes related to chromosome integrity, mitotic control,
and genome complexity, could predict metastasis outcome
in sarcoma [19]. Moreover, by comparing transcriptional
profiling data of uterine myometrium, leiomyoma, and
leiomyosarcoma (ULMS), Shan et al. discovered that 26
of the 50-most overexpressed genes in ULMS regulate
mitotic centrosome and spindle functions [27]. In GISTs,

(Figure 4). p21 has been shown to play a crucial role in G1
and G2 checkpoint control [38], and its role in MLN8237induced cell cycle arrest in GIST cells deserves further
investigation.
Furthermore, our studies determined that treatment
with MLN8237 induced cellular senescence in GIST
cells (Figure 7). Cell cycle arrest is not sufficient to cause
senescence. MLN8237 treatment inhibits AURKA, thus
causing cell cycle arrest (quiescence), but leaves the
proliferative signaling pathway (mTOR) intact (Figure 7C),
which could converts an arrest into senescence
(geroconversion) [39]. In this study, we demonstrated
that MLN8237 not only significantly increased SA- ß-gal
activity in GIST cells (Figure 7A and 7B), but also
induced expression of senescence biomarkers such as
DEC1, DcR2, and IL-6 (Figure 7C, 7D, and 7E) [25, 26].
Cellular senescence is an important phenotype resulting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from treatment with cell cycle inhibitors [40, 41], and
senescence-associated markers may become important
biomarkers for therapy with these compounds. The role
of senescence in the cytotoxic mechanism of these agents
awaits further clarification.
Several clinical factors e.g., age, performance status,
tumor size, and treatment response, were also identified
as prognostic factors among patients with advanced
GISTs. Among them, tumor size clearly was one of the
most important factors in predicting PFS and OS. In this
study, the size of the five largest lesions was measured and
defined by the RECIST criteria [42], and the sum of the
largest dimension was used as tumor size. Tumor size is
known to be associated with recurrence of localized GISTs
[14–16] and to be a prognostic factor for OS of patients with
advanced GISTs [7, 8, 10]. Treatment response was also an
independent prognostic factor for PFS, as expected [7, 8].
4081

Oncotarget

In the MetaGIST study, several laboratory data
were shown to have prognostic significance, e.g.,
abnormal blood count and albumin level [10]. In this
study, platelet count and albumin level had prognostic
significance in predicting either OS or PFS by univariate
analysis. However, neither was an independent factor in
multivariate analysis. Interestingly, an elevated AST level
was an independent prognostic factor for OS; however,
the reason for this association remains unknown. The
mutation status of a patient failed to be a prognostic
factor, probably because of the limited number of
samples tested.
In conclusion, the current study showed that
the expression of AURKA was an independent poor
prognostic factor for both PFS and OS in patients with
advanced GISTs who were treated with IM. Inhibition
of AURKA with MLN8237 may represent a novel
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced
GISTs.

Standard computed tomography (CT) imaging was
performed on each patient every three months for the
first three years and every six months for the following
two years to assess the patient’s response. Tumor size
was measured in at least five target lesions; the sum
of the largest dimension was used as an initial size
measurement as well as a response evaluation indicator,
as recommended by RECIST [42].

Immunohistochemical analysis of AURKA
expression in metastatic GISTs
To determine the expression of AURKA, a
4-μm section of each specimen was subjected to
immunohistochemical analysis. The primary antibody
against AURKA (rabbit anti-Aurora A polyclonal
antibody; NOVUS NB100-212) was diluted (1:1500)
and applied to the slides, which were then incubated
overnight at 4°C. The slides were then washed three times
for five minutes in TBST before visualization with the
DAKO LSAB2 System-HRP (No K0675, DAKO A/S,
Denmark). Control slides were incubated with secondary
antibody only. After washing three times for five minutes
in TBST, the slides were mounted. We used microscopy to
analyze the slides in a blinded fashion. The expression of
AURKA in GISTs was scored as either low (0%−29% and
30%−59% staining was scored as 0 or 1, respectively) or
high (60%−80% and 81%−100% staining was scored as 2
or 3, respectively) (Figure 1A).

Statement of translational relevance
Our previous studies revealed that AURKA
overexpression predicts recurrence in patients with
primary, surgically resected, gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GISTs). In the current study, we determined
that overexpression of AURKA is also an independent
poor prognostic factor of both PFS and OS in patients
with advanced GISTs. By using an in vitro model, we
also determined that MLN8237, an AURKA inhibitor,
inhibits growth of both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant
GIST cells and exerts synergistic cytotoxicity with IM.
The mechanism of inhibition could be attributed to the
induction of G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and senescence.
The role of AURKA as a potential therapeutic target
for GISTs should be further explored in in vivo models
as well as in clinical trials. Cellular senescence is an
important phenotype resulting from treatment with cell
cycle inhibitors, and senescence-associated markers may
become important biomarkers for therapy with these
compounds.

Statistical and survival analysis
PFS was defined as the length of time with no
progression after administration of IM. OS was defined as
survival after the administration of IM. All patients were
followed until death or December 2010. The correlations
between clinicopathological variables and AURKA
expression were analyzed by the χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests.
Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and
the log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves.
Univariate and multivariate (stepwise forward conditional
method) Cox regression analyses were used to determine
the prognostic significance of clinicopathological factors
and AURKA expression. A P value of <0.05 was regarded
as statistically significant in two-sided tests. The SPSS
software (version 13.00, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for all statistical analyses.

GIST430) were kindly provided by Dr. JA Fletcher.
The mutation status of the KIT gene in these cell lines

IM-sensitive cell line with a homozygous missense
mutation in exon 13 of KIT (K642E) [44]. The GIST430

line, which harbors a primary, heterozygous, inframe
deletion in exon 11 and a secondary, heterozygous,
missense mutation in exon 13 in KIT, and the GIST48
line, which harbors a primary, heterozygous, missense
mutation in exon 11 and a secondary, heterozygous,
missense mutation in exon 17 in KIT, are both relatively
IM-resistant [43]. MLN8237, an AURKA-selective
inhibitor, was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. It
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock
concentration of 10 mM. Nocodazole was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (CAS Number 31430-18-9). The
following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: antiAurora A/AIK (#3092; 1:1000), anti-phospho-Aurora A
(Thr288) (#3079; 1:500), anti-phospho-HistoneH3 (Ser10)
(pHisH3) (#9701; 1:1000), anti-p53 (#2524; 1:1000), and
anti-phospho-p70 S6 Kinase (#9205; 1:500), all from
Cell Signaling Technology; anti-p21 (sc-817; 1:1000)
and anti-DEC1 (sc-101023; 1:500), both from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; and anti-actin (ABS 24-100; 1:50000).

The viability of the cells was measured with the
TACS™ MTT cell proliferation assay (TREVIGEN
systems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration
of 2000–20000 cells/100 μl/well. The next day, drugs were
added at different concentrations; all experiments were
performed in triplicate. The plates were incubated for six
days at 37°C. Then, 10 μl of the MTT solution was added
to each well and the plates were incubated for an additional
four hours at 37°C. Then, a detergent solution (200 μl/
well) was added and mixed thoroughly to dissolve the
dark-blue crystals. The absorbance of the converted dye
was measured spectrophotometrically with a microplate
reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
at 570 nm (test) and 650 nm (reference). Cell survival was
calculated as the percentage of MTT inhibition as follows:
% survival = (mean experimental absorbance/mean control
absorbance) x 100 [46].
The possible synergistic effect of MLN8237 and
IM was analyzed with the CalcuSyn software program
(Biosoft, Ferguson, MO, USA), which is based on the
Chou and Talalay method [24]. The combination index (CI)
was calculated with CalcuSyn software. For the CI, a value
>1 is defined as antagonism, equal to 1 as additivity, and
<1 as synergy. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Western blotting
Monolayers of cultured cells were rinsed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into lysis
buffer (25 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS
[Thermo]) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (1:100 dilution; Thermo). The lysates were
incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C and then clarified by
centrifugation for 30 minutes at 13200 r.p.m. at 4°C. The
protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined
with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). Protein
extracts (20–50 µg per lane) were electrophoretically
separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gels, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes
(Millipore), and incubated with specific antibodies. The
immunoreactive bands were detected with an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Millipore) and X-ray films.

Trypan blue exclusion assay
The viability of the cells was also measured with
a trypan blue exclusion assay as previously described
[47]. GIST cells were seeded at 5 x 104 cells/well in
24-well plates. The next day, a variable concentration of
MLN8237 was added to each well and the plates were
incubated at 37°C for six days. All experiments were
performed in triplicate. Then the cells were trypsinized
and mixed with trypan blue. Viable cells have intact cell
membranes; thus, trypan blue is not absorbed, but dead
cells do absorb it. We counted the number of viable cells
with a light microscope.

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow
cytometry, as previously described [45]. Briefly, cells
were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and fixed
in 70% ethanol at -20°C for two hours. The fixed cells
were then washed twice with cold PBS and suspended in
420 μl of PBS. Next, 50 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma)
was added and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 30
minutes. Then 20 μl of 0.2 mg/ml PI was added and the
cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Calibur
(Becton Dickinson and Co., Oxford, CA, USA) and the
relative DNA content was determined on the basis of the
intensity of the red fluorescence. The percentage of cells
in each phase of the mitotic cell cycle was calculated with
the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson & Co.).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Detection of apoptosis
Drug-induced apoptosis was measured with
the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). After treatment with
MLN8237, the cells were washed once with 1x PBS and
resuspended in 100 μl of staining solution (containing
Annexin V-FITC and PI in a HEPES buffer). After being
incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, the cells
were diluted in 1x Annexin V–binding buffer and the
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow
cytometry FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson and Co.,
Oxford, CA, USA) [48].
