Abstract

Author Manuscript

Genome sequencing is revealing a vast mutational landscape in leukemia, offering new
opportunities for treatment with targeted therapy. Here we identify two patients with acute
myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose tumors harbor point mutations
in the ALK kinase. The mutations reside in the extracellular domain of ALK and are potently
transforming in cytokine-independent cellular assays and primary mouse bone marrow colony
formation studies. Strikingly, both mutations conferred sensitivity to ALK kinase inhibitors,
including the FDA approved drug crizotinib. On the basis of our results, we propose that tumors
harboring ALK mutations may be therapeutically tractable for personalized treatment of certain
aggressive leukemias with ALK inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase in the insulin receptor
subfamily with homology to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor kinase (IGF1R) and insulin receptor kinase (INSR) (1). ALK consists of a large
ligand-binding extracellular domain, transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic domain

comprised largely of the tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular domain consists of two
MAM (meprin, A5 protein and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase mu) domains, a LDLa
(low-density lipoprotein) and a glycine rich region (2). Although its normal physiological
role is not entirely clear, ALK is proposed to play a role in the development of the nervous
system based on its high level of expression in embryonic neural tissue (2).

ALK was originally identified as part of a gene fusion in patients with anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (3). This fusion is a result of an in-frame fusion of the cytoplasmic domain of
ALK to the N-terminus of nucleolar phosphoprotein (NPM) (3). In anaplastic large cell
lymphoma STAT3 is a key mediator, which is required for the neoplastic transformation and
prevents cell death(4,5). ALK rearrangements have also been identified in non-small-cell
lung carcinomas (NSCLC), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and other solid tumors
(1). In NSCLC, the most common ALK fusion partner is echinoderm microtubule-associated
protein-like 4 (EML4), which was found in 6.7% of cases (6). ALK overexpression has been
observed in multiple tumor types (2). In neuroblastoma, activating point mutations are found
in the ALK kinase domain (7).
Multiple ALK inhibitors are being developed clinically. Crizotinib, (PF-2341066, Xalkori,
Pfizer) an ATP-competitive MET, ALK and ROS1 inhibitor (8), is the most clinically
advanced and is now FDA-approved for front-line treatment in ALK-positive NSCLC. In a
phase 3 clinical trial the response rate for patients with ALK positive NSCLC was 65% (9).
ALK is therefore a promising therapeutic target in a variety of tumor types.

We recently sequenced primary samples from leukemia patients and found that aside from a
few relatively frequent mutations, there are large numbers of mutations that occur at low
frequency. A similar mutational landscape of cancer is emerging from large datasets
produced from other efforts(10). Understanding which of these mutations are oncogenic
drivers that can be therapeutically targeted remains a major challenge. We report sequencing
from two leukemia patients with somatic mutations in the extracellular domain of ALK that
were of unknown significance. Here, we show that these mutations are oncogenic and cells
transformed by these mutant versions of ALK are sensitive to crizotinib and other ALK
inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequencing of leukemia patient samples

Author Manuscript

Primary blood and bone marrow specimens were obtained after written informed consent
from patients with hematologic malignancies according to a protocol approved by the
OHSU institutional review board. Deep sequencing was performed on 1862 kinase and
kinase associated genes as described previously (11). 185 patient samples were sequenced,
including 96 Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 51 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, and 38
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms. The ALK A348D mutation was verified by Sanger
sequencing using the following M13F and M13R tagged primers (ALK-e4-L
gtaaaacgacggccagtCCACAGAGCTACTGCTGGTC and ALK-e4-R
caggaaacagctatgaccACCAAAAGCCAAATCACCTG) and then sequenced using M13F

The ALK F856S mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing by Genewiz Inc.
Cloning
A gateway compatible entry clone containing the ALK cDNA was obtained from
Genecopoeia (ALK pDONR, GC-T1863). The ALK A348D and F856S mutations were
made by site directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL Kit (Agilent Technologies,
Inc.) and the following primers: ALK_A348D_F cactgcacactggacgtctcggtgcac,

Mutated cDNAs were then transferred into a Gateway-compatible MSCV-IRES-GFP vector
using the LR Clonase enzyme (Life Technologies). Constructs were verified by Sanger
sequencing.
Cell Culture and Virus Production
293T17 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Atlanta Biologicals), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and amphotericin B
(HyClone). To produce murine retrovirus, 293T17 cells were co-transfected with pEcopac
helper packaging plasmid and MSCV-IRES-GFP as an empty vector or containing WT or
mutant versions of ALK. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 hours post-transfection.

Author Manuscript

Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta
Biologicals), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), amphotericin B (HyClone),
and 15% WEHI conditioned medium (a source of IL3). Ba/F3 mutant lines were generated
by spinoculation with viral supernatants and polybrene at 2500 rpms for 90 minutes. GFP
positive infected cells were then sorted using a FACS Aria flow cytometer.
Immunoblot Analysis
Immunoblot analysis was performed on the Ba/F3 cell lines as described previously(11).
The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-ALK (Cell Signaling Technology #3333) and
Rabbit anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology # #25778).
IL3-Independence Assays

Author Manuscript

Ba/F3 cells expressing either WT ALK or the ALK mutations were generated by retroviral
infection. Ba/F3 lines expressing WT ALK or ALK mutants were washed three times in
RPMI medium with 10% FBS (to remove all traces of IL3 containing WEHI conditioned
medium). Cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per mL and counted on a Guava personal flow
cytometer every other day and divided as necessary.
Colony Assays
Bone marrow was isolated from BALB/c mice, cells were stimulated overnight with IL3,
IL6 and stem cell factor, and then spinoculated with ALK expressing retrovirus, polybrene
and Hepes buffer on two successive days. Cells were plated in methylcellulose (Stem Cell

Technologies, M3234) and then counted on day 7 post-plating. Animal work was conducted
in accordance with OHSU IACUC protocol number IS00002726.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Identification of ALK point mutations in leukemia patient samples

Author Manuscript

Deep sequencing of 1862 kinase and kinase associated genes in 185 leukemia samples
revealed oncogenic point mutations in ALK in specimens from two patients diagnosed with
hematologic malignancies. The first specimen from a pediatric patient with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) exhibited an ALK A348D mutation that resides within the
MAM1 domain of ALK (Figure 1A). The other specimen was obtained from an adult patient
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and exhibited an ALK F856S point mutation within the
glycine-rich domain (Figure 1A). The presence of both of these mutations was confirmed by
Sanger sequencing, which showed that both mutations were heterozygous (Figures 1B and
1C). Interestingly the B-ALL sample also harbored the NRAS mutations, G12C and G12S.
Oncogenic mutations of known significance were not found in the AML sample, but it
should be noted that the capture library is focused on kinase-associated genes, and there may
therefore be other mutations present that were not assessed in this platform.
Leukemia-associated ALK point mutations exhibit oncogenic capacity

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the ALK mutations identified in AML and B-ALL patient specimens
carried oncogenic capacity, we employed a cytokine-independence transformation assay.
The murine pro-B cell Ba/F3 cell line normally requires the cytokine IL3 for growth. In the
presence of certain transforming oncogenes, Ba/F3 cells can grow indefinitely in the absence
of IL3. Both ALK A348D and ALK F856S mutant expressing Ba/F3 cell lines proliferated
in the absence of IL3, while overexpression of WT ALK did not confer IL3-independent
growth (Figures 2A). The mutant forms of ALK were expressed at similar levels to WT
ALK (Figure 2B). To confirm that these mutations carried transformative capacity by an
independent assay, we infected murine bone marrow with ALK mutants and tested their
ability to form colonies in methylcellulose. The ALK A348D and F856S mutations were
able to induce mouse bone marrow colony formation in the absence of exogenous cytokines,
providing additional evidence that these mutations have oncogenic capacity (Figure 2C).

Author Manuscript

We next wanted to determine if ALK was expressed in these samples. Although material
was not available for expression analysis from the AML sample, we were able to analyze
ALK expression in the B-ALL sample with the ALK A348D mutation by Affymetrix exon
arrays. We utilized a set of 25 samples, which had expression measurements using the
Affymetrix Exon array. To determine expression we used a metric known as the probeset
detected above background measure (PSDABG) which tests whether a given probeset
displays significantly higher intensity than background regions with similar GC
content(12,13). We computed the PSDABG measure for the 40 probesets belonging to the
high confidence 'core' annotation group defined by Affymetrix. We found that 25/40
(62.5%) of the probesets exhibited a PSDABG value < .05 with 2 of them surviving a
Bonferroni correction (Supplemental Figure 1). As each probeset was designed to target an

exon, this suggests that the majority of the exons of ALK are expressed above background
for this sample.
ALK inhibitors are being used therapeutically for patients with ALK rearrangements in lung
cancer(9,14). We tested the most clinically advanced ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, against the
ALK mutant Ba/F3 cell lines. The growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing both mutants was highly
sensitive to crizotinib, with IC50s of 33 nM for ALK A348D cells and 6 nM for the ALK
F856S cells (Figure 2D).
ALK point mutations are sensitive to multiple ALK inhibitors

Author Manuscript

To further test the sensitivity of the ALK A348D and F856S mutations to ALK inhibitors,
we used four additional ALK inhibitors. The NVP-TAE684 compound was developed as a
potent and specific inhibitor of NPM-ALK fusion and blocks the proliferation of lung cancer
cell lines harboring ALK gene fusions (15). NVP-TAE684 inhibited the cell survival and
proliferation of Ba/F3 ALK A348D and ALK F856S cells with IC50s of 2.5 nM and ~0.5
nM respectively. The second-generation ALK inhibitor AP26113 was developed to
overcome crizotinib resistance (14) mediated by the emergence of ALK L1196M mutation
(16,17) and is in Phase 1/2 development. Treatment of ALK mutant-transformed Ba/F3 cells
with AP26113 potently inhibited cell growth with an IC50 of 3 nM for the A348D mutant
and 0.6 nM for the F856S mutant.

LDK378 is highly selective for ALK with 30–40 fold sensitivity for ALK over IGF1R and
INSR, and showing an IC50 for growth of NPM-ALK-transformed Ba/F3 cells at 26 nM as
well as an IC50 of 0.2 nM in cell free kinase assays (18). This compound inhibited ALK
A348D cell growth with an IC50 of 22 nm and F856S cell growth with an IC50 of 4 nM.
Finally, the GSK1838705A compound is potent against IGF1R, INSR and ALK (with an
IC50 of 0.5 nM)(19). It was also highly potent in inhibiting growth of ALK-transformed cell
lines with IC50s of 18 nM and 2nM for the A348D and F856S cells respectively. In
aggregate, these data show that the ALK point mutations found in leukemia patient samples
are highly sensitive to a variety of inhibitors directed against ALK.

Author Manuscript

The identification of oncogenic ALK point mutations in acute leukemia (AML and B-ALL)
is unexpected given that ALK fusions are exceedingly rare in leukemia. RANB2-ALK
fusions have been detected in an adult patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (20),
and three cases of childhood myeloid leukemia (21). Here we demonstrate that these ALK
point mutations are potently oncogenic. It is interesting that both mutations reside in the
extracellular domain of ALK. In neuroblastoma, ALK point mutations are found primarily
in the kinase domain (2), while they can occur in both the kinase domain and the
extracellular domain in patients with lung cancer, although due to the lack of expression of
ALK in the lung, the significance of these mutations to cancer progression is not yet clear
(22). These extracellular domain mutations have been identified in both the MAM domains
as well as the glycine rich domain, similarly to the mutations described here (22). The
extracellular mutations identified in lung cancer were able to increase tumor burden in
xenograft models (22). These extracellular domain mutations had variable activation of
downstream STAT3, AKT and ERK signaling pathways (22). Although the function of the
MAM and glycine rich domains is still under investigation, it is clear that these regions are

important for ALK’s role in the proper development of the Drosophila gut (23).
Interestingly, the neuroblastoma cell line, NB1, had an activating deletion in the first MAM
domain leading to increased STAT3 signaling, possibly due to receptor mis-localization
(24). Future structural studies of the extracellular regions of ALK would provide a
framework for analysis of the structural impact of individual point mutations. Although,
oncogenic, the ALK mutations likely require other cooperating mutation in the progression
to leukemia, as evidenced by the presence of known oncogenic NRAS mutations in the BALL sample.

Author Manuscript

The ALK A348D and F856S extracellular mutations were highly sensitive to the approved
ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, and a variety of other ALK inhibitors in clinical development. As
we move towards individualized cancer therapy based on mutational profiles of patient
tumors, ALK point mutations, although present in a small percentage of samples, represent
an exciting therapeutic target. Characterization of additional ALK mutations and
demonstration of clinical efficacy will be required to fully implement ALK directed therapy
for leukemia patients.
