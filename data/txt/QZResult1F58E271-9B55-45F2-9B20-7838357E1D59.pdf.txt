ABSTRACT
Androgen receptor (AR) and MNK activated eIF4E signaling promotes the
development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we report
that our Novel Retinamides (NRs) target both AR signaling and eIF4E translation
in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa cells via enhancing AR and MNK
degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Dual blockade of AR and MNK
initiated eIF4E activation by NRs in turn induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and
inhibited cell proliferation. NRs also inhibited cell migration and invasion in metastatic
cells. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NRs on AR signaling, eIF4E translation
initiation and subsequent oncogenic program were more potent than that observed
with clinically relevant retinoids, established MNK inhibitors, and the FDA approved
PCa drugs. Our findings provide the first preclinical evidence that simultaneous
inhibition of AR and eIF4E activation is a novel and efficacious therapeutic approach
for PCa, and that NRs hold significant promise for treatment of advanced prostate
cancer.

INTRODUCTION

is dependent on serine 209 phosphorylation by MAPKinteracting kinases 1/2 (MNK1/2) [5]. Overexpression
of MNK and hyper-activation of eIF4E are common in
hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate tumors and
correlates with poor clinical outcome [6-10]. Analysis
of the molecular networks in androgen dependent and
independent PCa has revealed direct targeting of the
translational machinery, precisely eIF4E to be beneficial
in the treatment of CRPC [11]. Thus, a strong rationale
exists for identifying new drugs that can simultaneously
target both AR and eIF4E for treating advanced PCa.
Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents
(RAMBA), a family of compounds that inhibit the
P450 enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of alltrans-retinoic acid (ATRA) exert potent anticancer and
growth inhibitory effects in human breast/prostate cancer
cells and xenograft models [12-18]. Series of RAMBA
related compounds referred to as “Novel Retinamides”
(NRs) which are novel structural analogues of ATRA and

Androgen receptor (AR), a ligand dependent
transcription factor plays pivotal role in the development
and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), the most
frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous male malignancy
[1,2]. While majority of prostate cancers are initially
androgen dependent and respond to androgen ablation
therapy, most patients eventually recur with more
aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
where AR signaling is reactivated even in the absence of
androgen stimulation [2,3].
Besides AR signaling, hyper-activation of eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the mRNA 5′ capbinding protein of cap dependent translation promotes
exquisite transcript-specific translation of key mRNAs
that are indispensable in PCa initiation, progression
and metastases [4]. The oncogenic potential of eIF4E

Note: Cells were treated with listed compound (0.1 nmol/L-100 µmol/L) for 7 d and the GI50 values for the antiproliferative

RESULTS

4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) have been designed
and synthesized in our laboratory [12-18]. Recently, we
demonstrated that these NRs inhibit the growth of triple
negative, estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) and Her2overexpressing breast cancer cells by blocking MNK
initiated eIF4E activation [19].
In the current study, we explored the effect of NRs
to simultaneously target AR signaling and MNK activated
eIF4E translation initiation in androgen sensitive and
CRPC cells. Our data reveal that NRs are capable of
inhibiting the growth and progression of PCa by directly
targeting both AR signaling and eIF4E translational
machinery via enhancing AR and MNK degradation
through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which in turn
led to inhibition of downstream events that promote cell
growth, proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis evasion,
invasion and metastasis. Our findings establish for the
first time that agents such as NRs, which simultaneously
inhibit activation of both AR and eIF4E to suppress
growth and progression in genetically diverse PCa cells
at pharmacologically feasible concentration, are novel
therapeutics for treatment of both androgen-sensitive and
castration resistant PCa.

Novel retinamides inhibit growth and colony
formation in PCa cells
To determine the effect of NRs on PCa cell growth,
androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3,
C4-2B) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate
cancer cells were treated with NRs (VN/66-1, VNLG145, -146, -147, -148, -152, -153), VN/14-1, ATRA,
4-HPR, Casodex, Abiraterone acetate (AA) (Zytiga)
and MDV3100 (Enzalutamide) (Figure 1) and assessed
for cell viability by MTT assay. We found that NRs,
particularly VNLG-145, -147, -152 and -153 inhibited the
growth of PCa cells with a GI50 value 1.5 - 5.5 µmol/L
(Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). The growth
inhibitory potential of these NRs were more potent than
that observed for VN/66-1, our previously established
lead RAMBA; VN/14-1, the parent RAMBA from which
the new NR series (VNLG-145, -146, -147, -148, -152,
-153) were derived; clinically relevant retinoids (ATRA
and 4-HPR) and almost comparable to that of the FDA
approved PCa drugs (Casodex, AA, MDV3100). Our
results also indicated that the growth inhibitory effect of
NRs in PCa cells was significantly much higher (12-30
fold) compared to that in immortalized untransformed
prostate cells signifying that NRs are differentially

sensitive towards untransformed and malignant prostate
cells. The other NRs (VNLG-146 and -148) did not
display any notable growth inhibitory effect or differential
sensitivity (Table 1). Analysis of the effect of NRs on
colony forming ability of PCa cells, indicated that lead
NRs in addition to inhibiting cell viability were also able
to inhibit PCa colony formation (Figure 2A and B) .
We next evaluated the growth inhibitory potential
of NRs, specifically VN/66-1, VNLG-145, -147, -152,
-153 that showed promising growth and colonization
inhibitory potential in prostate cancer cells in comparison
with casodex, AA and MDV3100 in LNCaP cells that
were resistant to MDV3100 treatment (MR49F). Our
results revealed that NRs significantly inhibited the
growth of these resistant cells with a GI50 value ≅ 3.5 –
7.5 µmol/L, which was several times more potent than
that observed for the FDA approved drugs Casodex or
AA (GI50: 43.65 and 27.54 µmol/L respectively). We also
note that Enzalutamide had no significant effect up to a
concentration of 100 µmol/L (Figure 2C).

3A, 24 h exposure of LNCaP cells to lead NRs (10 µM)
resulted in a 2 - 4 fold dramatic inhibition of DHT induced
AR transcriptional activity that was far more potent than
that observed upon ATRA, 4-HPR, Casodex, MDV3100
or AA treatments. We further examined the effect of NRs
in inhibiting AR transcriptional activity in Enzalutamide
resistant cells. Our results indicated that lead NRs at a
concentration of 10 µM resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease
in DHT induced AR transcriptional activity whereas
Enzalutamide had no effect. The observed decrease in
DHT induced AR transcriptional activity of lead NRs was
comparable to that seen in AA treated cells and stronger
than that detected upon Casodex treatment (Figure 3A).
To further determine whether the inhibition of
transcriptional activity could be translated to inhibition of
protein expression, we next explored the effects of NRs
on AR and its responsive protein, PSA in DHT induced
LNCaP cells. As seen in Figure 3B, 24 h treatment of
LNCaP cells with lead NRs caused a signiﬁcant downregulation in the expression of both full-length AR (fAR)
and its target gene, PSA. A similar pattern of result was
observed upon NRs treatment in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells.
In addition, in 22Rv1 cells lead NRs were also able to
down-regulate the expression of AR splice variant AR3
(Figure 3B). The down-regulatory effects of NRs on fAR,
AR3 and PSA were more potent than that observed with
ATRA and 4-HPR in all the PCa cells analyzed.

NRs modulate androgen receptor (AR) expression
and activity in cultured human prostate cancer
cells
Since AR is a major driver of proliferation in
PCa [20], we next examined the effect of NRs on AR
transcriptional activity in PCa cells. As shown in Figure

NRs simultaneously reduce MNK and peIF4E
expression in PCa cells

NRs inhibited prostate cancer cell growth,
cell migration and invasion, and induced cell
apoptosis

We next examined the expression of MNK and
eIF4E (total and Ser209 phosphorylated form) in three PCa
cell lines in comparison with established retinoids and
known MNK inhibitors, CGP57380 and cercosporamide.
We observed that 24 h treatment of PCa cells with lead
NRs reduced the expression of MNK1, MNK2 and
peIF4Eser209 with no notable effect was on the expression
of total eIF4E (Figure 3C). The observed decrease in
the expression of MNKs and peIF4Eser209 were more
pronounced than that observed upon treatment with
ATRA, 4-HPR, and MNK inhibitors.

We next sought to determine the functional
relevance of AR and MNK/peIF4E downregulation on
cell cycle and apoptosis- the major downstream effect
of constitutive AR signaling and eIF4E activation in
malignant PCa cells. As shown in Figure 4A, 24 h
treatment of PCa cells with VN/14-1, VNLG-145, -147,
-152 and -153 (5 µM ) reduced the number of cells in
S phase and concomitantly increased their population
in G2/M phase (8.89, 8.43, 11.6, 11.0, 11.2, 7.5 and 8.3
% respectively) compared to untreated cells (4.05%). In

compared with vehicle treated control. (G) Expression of full-length and cleaved PARP protein was investigated by Western blot in LNCaP

VNLG-152 treated LNCaP cells, in addition to an increase
in G2/M phase cells there was also a remarkable increase
in the percentage of cells in G1 phase (74.6%) compared
to untreated control (37.1%). NRs induced cell cycle arrest
was also accompanied by simultaneous decrease in the
expression of cyclins D1 and B that are associated with
G1/S and M cell cycle phases (Figure 4B).
We next assessed the effect of lead NRs on apoptosis
in PCa cells by acridine orange-ethidium bromide dual
staining. As seen in Figure 4D, viable cells stained only
by acridine orange were bright green with intact structure,
whereas apoptotic cells (induced by NR treatment) stained
predominantly by ethidium bromide and to a slight extent
by acridine orange were orange-red colored displaying
cell shrinkage, chromosomal condensation, and nuclear
fragmentation, the characteristic features of apoptosis
[21]. The apoptosis inducing potential of NRs was also
confirmed quantitatively by ELISA assay (Figure 4C).
Analysis of the expression of apoptosis associated
proteins, Bax and PARP-1 cleavage by Western blot
analysis revealed an increase in the expression of proapoptotic Bax and cleaved PARP-1 in NRs (20 µM)
treated PCa cells relative to control. Among the lead

NRs, VNLG-147 and -152 exhibited greater efficacies in
inducing PARP cleavage and/or increasing Bax expression
(Figure 4E). Additionally, LNCaP cells were treated with
VNLG-147/-152 in the presence or absence of pan-caspase
inhibitor ZVAD (5 µM, 24 h) to confirm whether apoptosis
induction by NRs was caspase mediated. Our results
showed that combined treatment of ZVAD completely
suppressed NRs induced oligonucleosomal fragmentation
(Figure 4F) and PARP-1 cleavage (Figure 4G) confirming
that NRs induced apoptosis via the caspase-dependent
pathway.
We also evaluated the inhibitory effects of NRs on
cell invasion and migration- the late stage carcinogenic
events in the metastatic PCa cell line, PC-3 by woundhealing and trans-well invasion assays [22]. We found
that 24 h after cell monolayers were wounded control
cells had completely filled in the scratched area. Whereas
incubation of PC-3 cells with NRs, in particular VNLG147, -152 and -153 at concentration of 5 μM for 24 h
potentially suppressed PC-3 cell migration to the denuded
zone (Figure 5A), revealing that NRs potentially inhibit
the motility of PC-3 cells. To further elucidate the
inhibitory effect of NRs on the invasion of PC-3 cells

Figure 5: Anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential of NRs. (A) Effect of NRs treatment (5 μmol/L) on PC-3 cell migration was

assessed by wound healing assay after 24 h of wound formation. Representative photomicrographs of initial and final wounds are shown
at 100x magnification. (B) Effect of NRs on PC-3 cell invasion was evaluated by transwell migration assay. PC-3 cells were seeded on
matrigel coated boyden chamber and treated with NRs (5 μmol/L, 24 h). Photographs represent the extent of cell invasion in each of the
treated cells. (C) Western blot analysis of the effect of NRs on the expression of cadherins in PC-3 cells. Cells were treated with indicated
compound 20 μmol/L for 24 h. Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with E- and N-cadherin antibodies. Vehicle
treated cells were included as a control and all blots were reprobed for β-actin for equal protein loading and transfer.

across extracellular matrix (ECM), the cells that invaded
through the matrigel coated polycarbonate filter in the
Boyden chamber were analyzed. Our results showed that
NRs treatment (5 μM) for 24 h profoundly suppressed
invasion of PC-3 cells across the matrigel-coated filter.
The percentage of cell invasion was 33, 13 and 35 for
VNLG-147, -152 and -153, respectively compared to
control (Figure 5B and C). In addition, lead NRs were also
able to modulate the expression of E- and N-cadherin, the
key players in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
(Figure 5D). Our results thus signify that NRs induced
anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects in PC-3 cells is
primarily due to their modulatory effects on cell adhesive
cadherins.
These data collectively suggest that NRs exhibit
potent anti-cancer effects that are more pronounced than
parent RAMBA, VN/14-1 and the clinically relevant
retinoids ATRA and 4-HPR. Amongst the NRs, VNLG152 exhibited the most impressive anti-cancer effects and
was therefore chosen for further detailed investigations.

the impact of AR and/or MNK siRNA on the survival of
LNCaP cells by MTT assay. The efficiency of transfection
was confirmed by western blot analysis, wherein protein
lysates obtained from the transfected cells after AR siRNA
transfection showed a temporal decrease in total AR
protein and cells transfected with MNK1 siRNA showed
a temporal decrease in the expression of both MNK1 and
peIF4E compared to scrambled (siSCR) treated controls
after 18 h of transfection. Cells co-treated with AR and
MNK1 siRNA showed a remarkable decrease in the
expression of both AR and MNK1 compared to scrambled
siRNA treated cells (Figure 6A). MTT assay revealed that
transient transfections with AR or MNK1 siRNA alone for
18 h caused a considerable decrease (≈ 30%) in LNCaP
cell viability compared to control (compare lane 1 to
lanes 2 and 3). Co-transfection of LNCaP cells with both
AR and MNK1 siRNA (compare lanes 1 and 4) further
augmented loss of viability in LNCaP cells. Treatment
of LNCaP cells (untransfected) with VNLG-152 (5 µM)
for 72 h showed a robust reduction in cell viability (lane
5). LNCaP cells harboring MNK1 (lane 6) or AR (lane 7)
knockdown also displayed a significant decrease in cell
viability upon treatment with VNLG-152 compared to the
MNK1 and AR siRNA alone treated counterparts (lane 2
and 3, respectively). However, LNCaP cells with double
knockdown of AR and MNK1 genes (lane 8) did not show
any significant decrease in cell viability upon VNLG-152
treatment compared to lane 4, which was co-treated with

AR and MNK are the prime targets of VNLG152’s anti-cancer effects in PCa cells
To confirm whether the observed anti-cancer
effects of VNLG-152 on PCa cells was primarily due to
its inhibitory effects on AR and MNK, we investigated

AR and MNK proteins are decreased posttranslationally upon VNLG-152 treatment

MNK1 and AR siRNA (Figure 6B). These results strongly
suggest that MNK1 and AR are indispensable for VNLG152 to mediate its growth inhibitory effects in LNCaP
cells, and that loss of both prime targets abolish the potent
growth-inhibitory effects mediated by VNLG-152.
To further authenticate that VNLG-152 induced
loss of cell viability at GI50 concentration was due to
downregulation of AR and MNKs, we performed a dosedependent analysis by treating LNCaP cells with different
concentrations of VNLG-152 (0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15
and 20 μM) for 24 h. As seen in Figure 6C, VNLG-152
triggered a dose-dependent decrease in the expressions of
fAR, MNK1, and peIF4E with notable effect at 2.5 µM
concentration (observed GI50 concentration of VNLG152 in LNCaP cells) and above. However, in the case
of MNK2, though VNLG-152 exerted a dose-dependent
decline maximal effect was observed only at 20 µM
concentration. Besides MNKs and AR, a dose-dependent
decrease in the expression of cell cycle regulatory cyclin
D1 and increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax
and caspase was also observed in LNCaP cells at the GI50
concentration. These results endorse the fact that VNLG152 induced loss of cell viability is due to downregulation
of AR and MNKs.

Since AR and MNK protein levels were signiﬁcantly
reduced in response to 24 h treatment of VNLG-152 in
a dose-dependent manner, we next investigated the
expression of AR and MNK in LNCaP cells following
treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis
inhibitor to unveil whether VNLG-152 induced AR and
MNK downregulation occurs at the level of protein
translation. Our results showed that AR and MNK
(MNK1 and MNK2) were profoundly reduced even
within 12 h of VNLG-152 treatment compared to control.
However, CHX treatment failed to induce noticeable AR/
MNK downregulation at the same time points relative to
VNLG-152 treated cells signifying that post-translational
mechanisms are in play in VNLG-152 induced AR/MNK
downregulation (Figure 7A, 7B, 8A and 8B).

western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Ub) (C, upper panel). The same blot was used to detect AR protein with anti-AR (rabbit)
antibody after stripping (C, lower panel). (E) Total cell lysate from LNCaP cells treated with VNLG-152 (20 μmol/L) in the presence or

VNLG-152 reduce AR and MNK expression via
proteasomal degradation

VNLG-152 induced proteasomal degradation of
AR is mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases (MDM2/
CHIP)

Because our results revealed that AR and MNK
protein ablation by VNLG-152 is post-translational, we
asked whether this occurred via ubiquitin–proteasome
system. For this we treated LNCaP cells with 20 μM
VNLG-152 in the presence or absence of MG-132 (5
μM), the 26S proteasome inhibitor. As seen in Figures 7C
and 8C, MG-132 treatment largely restored the AR, MNK
(MNK1 and 2) and peIF4E level decreased by VNLG-152.
Since inhibition of proteasomal activity by MG-132 leads
to an increase in polyubiquitinated form of AR and MNK
(Figure 7D and 8D), we stripped and reprobed the same
blot with anti-ubiquitin antibody. There was an increase
in the extent of ubiquitinated protein in the lanes treated
with MG-132 with or without VNLG-152 treatment. This
result indirectly shows that MG-132 treatment resulted
in accumulation of ubiquitinated form of AR/MNK as
proteasomal activity is inhibited; suggesting that VNLG152 mediated AR/MNK degradation is largely proteasome
dependent.

Proteasomal degradation of the AR is known to
be mediated by the E3 ligases, MDM2 or CHIP [23].
To test the involvement of these E3 ubiquitin ligases in
VNLG-152 induced AR degradation, we interfered with
AR degradation in LNCaP cells by knocking down CHIP
and/or MDM2 using MDM2/ CHIP siRNA. We found that
depletion of MDM2 or CHIP signiﬁcantly reduced VNLG152-induced AR degradation in LNCaP cells (Figure
7E) compared to lane 1 and 2 that represent control and
VNLG-152 alone treated cells. We also observed an
additional protection of the AR when we knocked down
CHIP along with MDM2 (lane 5) suggesting that both
CHIP and MDM2 are involved in VNLG-152 induced AR
degradation.

progression has been reported, several strategies to target
the respective signaling pathways have been developed
[3,20,24,25]. However, simultaneous targeting of AR
signaling and MNK facilitated eIF4E activation- the
major signaling pathways involved in PCa development,
progression, and transition from androgen dependence
to androgen resistant form, to develop proof-of-concept
small molecule inhibitors as potential PCa therapeutics
has not yet been shown [9,20]. Here, we demonstrate
for the first time that our proprietary novel retinamides
can simultaneously inhibit both AR signaling and MNK
facilitated eIF4E translation initiation and impede growth
and progression of in androgen dependent (LNCaP) and
castration resistant (C4-2B, 22Rv1) prostate cancer cells.
Most interestingly, NRs also block AR expression, activity
and cell growth in cells that are resistant to enzalutamide
treatment. Our data collectively suggest that NRs may be
promising novel therapeutics for patients with advanced
prostate cancer and those resistant to enzalutamide
treatment.

Androgen-AR signaling has a critical role in
prostate cancer development and progression in part
through transcriptional regulation of AR responsive
genes [20]. Earlier studies have validated that AR splice
variants, especially the most dominant variant AR3 which
lacks a portion of ligand binding domain contributes to
the transition of prostate cancer from androgen dependent
to castration resistance. While constitutively active AR3
might itself facilitate PCa cell growth and progression,
it may even depend on full-length AR to execute AR
transcriptional activity and cell growth effects [26]. In
the present study, NRs treatment downregulated the
expression of full-length AR (in LNCaP, C4-2B and
22Rv1); splice variant AR3 (in 22Rv1); and the AR
responsive protein, PSA in genetically diverse PCa cells.
Furthermore, NRs also dramatically reduced DHT induced
AR transcriptional activation in LNCaP and MR49F,
the enzalutamide resistant LNCaP cells. In mechanistic
studies identifying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated AR
down-regulation in LNCaP cells, treatment with protein

MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligases. Degradation of AR by in turn obstructs AR mediated signaling and transcription of AR responsive genes that
play crucial role in PCa development and progression. Simultaneously NRs can also inhibit MNK activated eIF4E translation initiation
in LNCaP cells by promoting proteasomal degradation of MNKs. This event in turn inhibits phosphorylation of eIF4E at ser209 residue,
subsequent formation of translation initiation complex and translation of key mRNAs critical for PCa development and progression.

synthesis inhibitor did not have any effect on VNLG-152
induced AR down-regulation, whereas the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 largely restored VNLG-152 induced
AR decrease. Knockdown of the E3 ubiquitin ligases,
CHIP or MDM2 individually or in combination abrogated
VNLG-152 mediated fAR degradation, suggesting that
NR (VNLG-152) mediated AR down-regulation in LNCaP
cells involved degradation of the active AR protein via
proteasomal degradation through the activation of E3
ubiquitin ligases CHIP and MDM2. Our finding that
AR is degraded through CHIP is consistent with the
degradation of nuclear receptors where ubiquitination has
been demonstrated to signal receptor degradation [27].
Involvement of MDM2 in promoting AR ubiquitination
and degradation has also been reported in a number
of studies [27-29]. Lin et al. demonstrated that AR
ubiquitination is impaired in MDM2-deficient mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to MDM2- intact
MEFs. Although our work confirms a role for MDM2 and
CHIP in degrading AR, the primary E3 ligase responsible
for degrading AR in response to VNLG-152 and the
molecular mechanisms underlying their preference are not
fully understood.
In addition to AR signaling, the role of MNK
mediated cap dependent translation in PCa development
and progression has been established in recent years
[24,30]. Initiation of cap dependent translation primarily
involves the assembly of eIF4F initiation complex
comprising of eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A on the 5’ cap of
mRNA [30]. Of all the members of the translation initiation
complex, eIF4E expression and activity is considered
crucial as this is the only protein that binds directly to the
mRNA cap structure [30]. Indeed, overexpression of eIF4E
alone has been shown to contribute directly to cellular
transformation [4,31]. The transforming properties of
eIF4E have been linked to its ability to promote translation
of genes involved in proliferation and survival including
that of c-Myc, cyclin D1, growth factors (fibroblast growth
factor 2, FGF2 and vascular endothelial growth factor,
VEGF), and Mcl-1 [30]. The oncogenic potential of eIF4E
is sternly dependent on phosphorylation at serine 209
residue by MNK1/2 which increase the affinity of eIF4E
for 5’ cap of mRNA.4 Both MNK and p-eIF4E are found
to be up-regulated in various cancers [19,32-34]. Bianchini
et al. demonstrated that eIF4E phosphorylation by MNKs
supports protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and
proliferation in prostate cancer. Furthermore combined
deficiency of MNK1 and 2 has been demonstrated to
delay tumour development [35]. In the present study, NRs
treatment dramatically reduced the expression of MNK1,
MNK2, and peIF4Eser209 without affecting total eIF4E
expression. Notably, the effect of NRs in depleting MNKs
and peIF4E proteins was far potent than the established
MNK inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380) and
clinically relevant retinoids- ATRA and 4-HPR.
Dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying

lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated MNK and peIF4E
down-regulation indicated that VNLG-152 stimulated
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MNKs,
the critical activators of eIF4E. Degradation of MNKs by
VNLG-152 may abrogate MNK mediated phosphorylation
of eIF4E at serine209, which subsequently impairs its
ability to enter the eIF4F initiation complex, binding to
5’ mRNA cap, and activation of cap-dependent translation
initiation [30]. The results of the present work are
consistent with the earlier report by Ramalingam et al.
who demonstrated that NRs induce MNK degradation and
block eIF4E phosphorylation in triple negative and Her2overexpressing breast cancers.
Constitutive AR signaling and/or eIF4E mediated
translation initiation favors translation of key genes
involved in oncogenesis [4,20]. Abrogation of both
these pathways may block translation of sub-set of genes
indispensable for maintaining growth and survival in PCa
cells. In the present study, the functional consequence of
AR and MNK knockdown on LNCaP cell proliferation
provides proof-of -principle for the importance of AR
and MNK mediated signaling in upholding growth and
survival of PCa cells, and also authenticates that AR
and MNK are the prime target of NR (VNLG-152) for
mediating growth inhibitory effects in PCa cells. The
biological significance of NRs mediated dual inhibition
of AR and MNK mediated signaling pathways is further
indicated by enhanced cell death and inhibition of cell
growth, cell colonization, migration and invasion in PCa
cells. Several studies in the past have elicited a direct
role of AR and eIF4E translation initiation in regulating
cell cycle progression [19,23,36,37]. Blocking of AR
expression has been demonstrated to induce strong cell
cycle arrest [37,38]. Results from the present study also
show that NRs induce cell cycle arrest at G1/S (VNLG152) or G2/M (VNLG-145, -147, -153) phase with
accompanied decrease in the expression of cyclin B and
cyclin D1 that are associated with G1/S and M phase cell
cycle transition. Besides inducing cell cycle arrest, NRs
treatment also induced caspase dependent apoptosis in PCa
cells through increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax.
Our findings indicate that synchronized dual inhibition
of AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation
by NRs in PCa cells results in blockade of cell cycle
progression and induction of caspase dependent apoptosis
which is in line with the earlier reports that demonstrate
that targeting AR or MNK in PCa cells results in induction
of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (19,37,38). In the highly
metastatic PC-3 cells which are also AR negative, NRs
treatment also impaired cell migration and invasion, the
late stage events essential for tumour metastasis [39].
The anti-invasive and anti-migratory effects of NRs were
associated with reappearance of E-cadherin and downregulation in the levels of N-cadherin. Earlier, Graff et al.
[40] demonstrated that cells with reduced levels of eIF4E
had reduced invasiveness and experimental metastasis.

Similarly, Li et al. [41] showed that knockdown of eIF4E
significantly inhibited invasion of human non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. These reports suggest
that elevated eIF4E expression is a positive regulator of
invasion, and that NRs inhibit migration and invasion, the
late stage carcinogenic events in the AR negative PC-3
cells by impeding MNK dependent eIF4E translation
initiation that is chiefly responsible for translation of
various key genes associated with invasion and metastasis
[4,30].
In summary, our study identiﬁes for the first time
novel retinamides that can simultaneously inhibit both
AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation
in prostate cancer cells (Figure 9). Most intriguingly,
our proprietary NRs were able to block AR activation
and cell growth in PCa cells resistant to Enzalutamide
treatment. NRs also displayed inhibitory and anti-cancer
effects in PCa cells in order far more potent than FDA
approved PCa drugs, established MNK inhibitors and
clinically relevant retinoids, with nominal effects on
immortalized untransformed prostate cells. Collectively,
these results suggest that novel retinamides that function
as dual inhibitors of AR and MNK signaling in androgendependent and castration-resistant PCa have great
potential as novel therapeutics for treatment of advanced
prostate cancer.

were treated with the NRs for 7 days. MTT assay was
performed at the end of the experiment. Calculations
of combination indices were done using the Calcusyn
program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). For
colony formation assay, cells were plated 1000 per well in
complete media and allowed to adhere for 24 h. The next
day cells were treated with indicated compounds (5 μM).
After 24 h compound containing media were removed, and
cells were allowed to form colonies in complete media.
Approximately 2 weeks later the colonies were fixed,
stained with 0.5% crystal violet (sigma) for 30 min and
counted manually. Results represent the mean ± standard
deviation of three independent experiments.

Transcriptional activation – luciferase assay
LNCaP cells were transferred to steroid-free
medium 3 days before the start of the experiment, and
plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in steroid-free medium.
The cells were dual transfected with ARR2-Luc and
the Renilla luciferase reporting vector pRL-null with
LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After a 24 h incubation period at 37 °C, the
cells were incubated with fresh phenol-red free serumfree RPMI 1640 medium and treated with DHT, ethanol
vehicle and/or the specified compounds in triplicate. After
a 24 h treatment period the cells were washed twice with
ice-cold DPBS and assayed using the Dual Luciferase
kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, cells were lysed with 100 μl of luciferase lysing
buffer, collected in a microcentrifuge tube, and pelleted
by centrifugation. Supernatants (100 μl aliquots) were
transferred to corresponding wells of opaque 96-well
multiwell plates. Luciferin was added to each well, and the
light produced during the luciferase reaction was measured
in a Victor 1420 scanning multi-well spectrophotometer
(Wallac, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After measurement,
Stop and Glo reagent (Promega) was added to quench the
firefly luciferase signal and initiate the Renilla luciferase
luminescence. Renilla luciferase luminescence was also
measured in the Victor 1420. The results are presented as
the fold induction, that is, the relative luciferase activity of
the treated cells divided by that of the control, normalized
to that of the Renilla [42].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Androgen-dependent
(LNCaP),
androgenindependent (PC-3) and castration resistant (C4-2B and
22Rv1) human prostate carcinoma cells were procured
from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA,
USA and maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco-Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
MR49F, Enzalutamide resistant LNCaP cells (a generous
gift of Dr. Amina Zoubeidi, The Vancouver Prostate
Centre) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin
and 10 µM Enzalutamide. Immortalized untransformed
prostate epithelial cells, PWR1E from American
Type Culture Collection were maintained in serumfree Keratinocyte media (Gibco) supplemented with
epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract. All
cell lines were maintained in a 37 °C/5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere.

FACS analysis
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and then
ﬁxed with 70% ethanol for 24 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were
stained in 1 ml of propidium iodide solution (0.05%
NP-40, 50 mg per ml propidium iodide, and 10 mg per
ml RNase A) for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Stained cells were
analyzed with a ﬂow cytometer using FlowJo software that
exploits Watson algorithm to find out peak and S-phase

top surface of the non-migrated cells were scraped gently
with cotton swabs and the cells on the lower surface of
the membrane (migrated cells) were fixed for 15 min
with cold methanol and stained with crystal violet. Cells
that had migrated to the bottom of the membrane were
visualized and counted using an inverted microscope. For
each replicate (n = 3), cells in three randomly selected
fields were counted and averaged.

Cell death assessment
Apoptosis was evaluated in PCa cells (LNCaP, C42B and 22Rv1) by acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual
staining. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plate at
seeding densities of 1 x 105 cells and then treated with 5
μM of indicated compounds for 24 h. Subsequently cells
were washed once with phosphate buffered saline and
incubated with 100 µl of 1:1 mixture of acridine orange
and ethidium bromide (4 µg/ml) for 30 min. Following
this, cells were immediately washed with PBS and
analyzed using Nikon TE2000 fluorescence microscope.
Cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments were
quantified by using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS
kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, ﬂoating and
attached cells were collected and homogenized in 400
µL of incubation buffer. The wells were coated with
antihistone antibodies and incubated with the lysates,
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-DNA antibodies,
and the substrate, in that sequence. Absorbance was
measured at 405 nm.

Western blotting and antibodies
For western blotting, cells were lysed in modiﬁed
RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA). Unless otherwise
described, 30 µg protein was resolved by SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred, and
immunoblotted with using the following antibodies:
AR, Bax, caspase-3, CHIP, cyclin B, cyclin D1, Ecadherin, eIF4E, MNK1, MDM2, N-cadherin, cleaved
PARP, peIF4Eser209, PSA procured from Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; anti-MNK2 was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; and
normal rabbit IgG, cyclin D1, E-cadherin, and Ub was
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA (19).
The dose of NRs used in the present study was
chosen based on the dose dependent experiment that
was initially performed (data not shown). Our results
revealed that NRs significantly modulated the expression
of proteins analyzed at dose starting at 5 µM with maximal
effect at 20 µM. Hence 20 µM concentration was chosen
for performing most of the analysis. While no significant
difference was observed at 5 and 20 µM concentration
with NRs in cell based assays, 5 µM was uniformly chosen
to perform cell based analysis.

Wound healing migration assay
For wound healing assay highly metastatic PC-3
cells were plated in a 24 well plate at a seeding density
of 5 x 105 cells/ well and allowed to form a confluent
monolayer for 24 h. Cells were made dormant by
pretreating with 0.5 µmol/L mitomycin C for 2 h to ensure
that wounds are filled due to cell migration and not by cell
proliferation. Subsequently, the monolayer was scratched
with a pipette tip, washed with media to remove floating
cells, and photographed (time 0 h). Cells were then treated
with indicated compounds (5 µM) and the experiment
was terminated as soon as wound was completely filled
in vehicle treated controls. Cells were then photographed
again using Nikon TE2000 microscope at three randomly
selected sites per well [43].

Gene silencing by siRNA
For siRNA transfection, 2 x 105 cells were seeded
in 6 cm dish for 24 h in culture medium. The cells were
then transfected with 100 nM of Mnk1/AR and nontargeting siRNAs (purchased from Ambion) for 18 h using
Lipofectamine® 2000 Transfection reagent (Invitrogen).
Protein silencing was confirmed by immunoblot analysis.
For cell growth assay experiments, transfection complex
were removed after 18 h, cells were washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with growth
medium. Twenty-four hour later drug was added and
harvested after 72 h. For transfection with MDM2 or CHIP
siRNA, LNCaP cells were transfected with 100 nM of
MDM2 or CHIP siRNA for 18 h, transfection complexes
were washed off and replaced with phenol free media for
24 h. Cells were then treated with 20 µM of VNLG-152
for an additional 24 h before cell lysis by RIPA lysis buffer
[44,45].

Boyden chamber invasion assay
The invasion assay in PC-3 cells was performed
using Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA)coated transwell cell culture chambers (8 µm pore size,
EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) as described
previously (43). Briefly, PC-3 cells (5 x 104 cells/well)
were cultured in the upper chamber of the transwell insert
for 24 h in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium. The cells
were then treated with 5 µM of indicated compounds
for 24 h. RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS was
placed in the lower chamber. At the end of incubation, the

LNCaP cells were treated with VNLG-152 (20 µM)
and MG-132 (5 μM) and combination thereof for 24 h,
harvested and lysed in modiﬁed RIPA buffer. MG-132
was added 8 h prior to the VNLG-152. Ubiquitinated
proteins were immunoprecipitated with 20 ml of protein
A/G sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA,

3X IP/lysis buffer and re-suspended in 2X SDS sample
loading buffer and boiled at 99 °C for 5 min. Samples
were then resolved by SDS–PAGE, and immunoblotted
for ubiquitin after stripping of the membrane for AR/MNK
