Summary

Author Manuscript

The HeLa cell line was established in 1951 from cervical cancer cells taken from a patient,
Henrietta Lacks, marking the first successful attempt to continually culture human-derived cells in
vitro1. HeLa’s robust growth and unrestricted distribution resulted in its broad adoption – both
intentionally and through widespread cross-contamination2 – and for the past sixty years it has
served a role analogous to that of a model organism3. Its cumulative impact is illustrated by the
fact that HeLa is named in >74,000 or ~0.3% of PubMed abstracts. The genomic architecture of
HeLa remains largely unexplored beyond its karyotype4, in part because like many cancers, its
extensive aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging. We performed haplotype-resolved whole
genome sequencing5 of the HeLa CCL-2 strain, discovering point and indel variation, mapping
copy-number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and phasing variants across full chromosome
arms. We further investigated variation and copy-number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight
additional strains. Surprisingly, HeLa is relatively stable with respect to point variation,
accumulating few new mutations since early passaging. Haplotype resolution facilitated
reconstruction of an amplified, highly rearranged region at chromosome 8q24.21 at which the
HPV-18 viral genome integrated as the likely initial event underlying tumorigenesis. We
combined these maps with RNA-Seq6 and ENCODE Project7 datasets to phase the HeLa
epigenome, revealing strong, haplotype-specific activation of the proto-oncogene MYC by the
integrated HPV-18 genome ~500 kilobases upstream, and permitting global analyses of the
relationship between gene dosage and expression. These data provide an extensively phased, highquality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa, and demonstrate the
value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer genomes and epigenomes.

genomes8 (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Although normal tissue corresponding to HeLa
is unavailable, the total number of SNVs identified in HeLa CCL-2 (n = 4.1 x 106) and the
proportion overlapping with the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP)9 (90.2%) were similar to
controls (mean n = 4.2 x 106 and 87.7%, respectively), suggesting that HeLa has not
accumulated appreciably large numbers of somatic SNVs relative to inherited variants. Indel
variation was unremarkable after accounting for differences in coverage (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Short tandem repeat profiles of HeLa also resembled controls, consistent with
mismatch repair proficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

After removing protein-altering variants overlapping with the 1000GP or Exome
Sequencing Project10, comparably many private protein-altering (PPA) SNVs were found in
HeLa (n = 269) and controls (mean n = 391). Gene ontology (GO) analysis found that all
terms enriched for PPA variants in HeLa (P ≤ 0.01) were also enriched in at least one
control (except for “startle response” in HeLa, presumably spurious), suggesting that known
cancer-related pathways are not extensively perturbed by point or indel mutations
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Although a previous study of the HeLa transcriptome11 reported an
enrichment of putative mutations in cell cycle- and E2F-related genes, subsequently
generated population-scale datasets contain all variants we observed in these genes,
suggesting they are inherited and benign rather than somatic and pathogenic.

Author Manuscript

The overlap between PPA variants and the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer
(COSMIC)12 was similar for HeLa (n = 1) and control genomes (mean n = 2.6). The genelevel overlap with the Sanger Cancer Gene Census (SCGC)12 was also comparable (HeLa, n
= 4; controls, mean n = 8.7). Canonical tumor suppressors and oncogenes were notably
absent among the five SCGC genes with PPA variants in HeLa (BCL11B, EP300, FGFR3,
NOTCH1, and PRDM16, Supplementary Tables 3–6). However, three are associated with
HPV-mediated oncogenesis (FGFR3, EP300, NOTCH1) and may be ancillary to the
dominant role of HPV oncoproteins in HeLa and other HPV+ cervical carcinomas13.
Mutations in FGFR3 have been previously noted in cervical carcinomas, although
infrequently and at different residues than observed here14. Both EP300 and NOTCH1 are
recurrently mutated in diverse cancers and are involved in Notch signaling, a pathway
dysregulated in HeLa15. EP300, encoding the transcriptional co-activator p300, directly
interacts with viral oncoproteins including HPV-16 E6 and E716. Although the in-frame
deletion of a highly conserved amino acid in EP300 appears somatic (heterozygous within
an LOH region), we cannot exclude that the others are rare, inherited variants or passenger
mutations. Further studies are required to resolve their functional relevance and to assess
whether these genes are recurrently altered in HPV+ cervical carcinomas.

Aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), hallmarks of cancer genomes, were mapped
in HeLa by constructing a digital copy-number profile to kilobase resolution (Figure 1,
Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 7). Read coverage profiles were segmented by a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and recalibrated to account for widespread aneuploidy
(Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). 61% of the genome is at a baseline copy number (CN) of
three, with only a small minority (3%) at CN>4 or CN<2 (Supplementary Table 8). LOH
encompassed 15.7% of the genome, including several entire chromosome arms (5p, 6q, Xp,
Xq) or large distal portions (2q, 3q, 6p, 11q, 13q, 19p, 22q) (Supplementary Fig. 7,

Supplementary Table 9), consistent with previous descriptions of LOH in cervical
carcinomas17. The overall profile is consistent with published karyotypes of various HeLa
strains4, suggesting that the hypertriploid state arose either during tumorigenesis or early in
the establishment of the HeLa cell line.
Structural variants were identified by clustering discordantly mapped reads from 40 kb and 3
kb mate-pair libraries (Supplementary Fig. 8). Twenty interchromosomal links were
identified, including for marker chromosomes M11 (9q33-11p14) and M14 (13q21-19p13).
Additionally, 209 HeLa-specific deletions and eight inversions were found (Supplementary
Figs. 9–11, Supplementary Table 10). Only two genes impacted by HeLa-specific structural
rearrangements (Supplementary Table 11) intersected with SCGC (STK1118, FHIT), both
recurrently deleted in cervical carcinomas18,19.

Conventional whole-genome sequencing fails to resolve haplotype phase, an essential aspect
of the description and interpretation of non-haploid genomes, including cancer genomes20.
Recently, several groups demonstrated genome-wide measurement of local5 or sparse21
haplotypes, but these approaches have yet to be applied to aneuploid cancer genomes. To
resolve haplotype phase across the HeLa genome, we applied clone dilution pool
sequencing5. Specifically, we sequenced 288 fosmid clone dilution pools, yielding 518,293
individual non-overlapping clones with a median insert size of 33 kb, for a total physical
coverage of 6.3X of the haploid reference genome (Supplementary Fig. 12). The
complement of likely inherited heterozygous variants (n = 1.97 x 106) was ascertained by
shotgun sequencing and intersection with 1000GP calls, and then re-genotyped using reads
from each clone pool. Observing alleles at two or more heterozygous sites in a given insert
phased those alleles to the same inherited haplotype, and implicitly phased the unobserved
alleles to the opposite haplotype. Merging overlapping clones from distinct pools yielded
haplotype blocks with an N50 of 550 kb containing 90.6% of likely inherited heterozygous
variants.

Author Manuscript

Most of the HeLa genome is present at an uneven haplotype ratio (e.g., 2:1 in CN=3
regions). We sought to exploit the resulting allelic imbalance to phase consecutive haplotype
blocks (Supplementary Fig. 13). We first calculated the cumulative allelic ratio among
shotgun reads for the SNVs residing in each haplotype block, which clustered closely with
the underlying haplotype ratio. For example, in non-LOH CN=3 regions that are necessarily
2:1 or 1:2, allelic ratios calculated for each block had distributions centered on 0.32 or 0.65,
close to the expected fractions of 1/3 and 2/3 (Supplementary Fig. 14). Using these ratios,
we merged haplotype blocks into scaffolds covering 1.96 Gb or 90.3% of the non-LOH
HeLa genome (scaffold N50 of 44.8 megabases (Mb); Supplementary Table 12). The
haplotype-resolved scaffolds were then merged with the copy number map to produce a
global, haplotype-resolved copy number profile of the aneuploid HeLa genome (Figure 1a,
Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary Table 13).
Phasing accuracy was independently confirmed by several methods. First, of informative
read pairs from 3 kb mate-pair sequencing (each read overlapping a phased site), 99.7%
were concordant with the predicted phase. Second, long-insert single-molecule sequencing
(Pacific Biosciences RS; mean, 2.97 kb; 90th percentile, 5.1 kb among informative reads)

showed 97.2% of reads in perfect agreement with the predicted phase despite the high perbase sequencing error rate of ~15% (Supplementary Fig. 16). Third, examination of allelic
state across 47.3 Mb of chromosome 18q, which underwent LOH in HeLa S3 but not in
CCL-2, showed that out of the 17,761 affected alleles (heterozygous in CCL-2 but at allele
balance > 0.9 among S3 reads), 99.7% corresponded to those phased together on haplotype
A in CCL-2 (Supplementary Fig. 17). Finally, windowed analysis of population allele
frequencies revealed likely African or European genetic ancestry across long stretches of the
haplotype-resolved genome, consistent with recent admixture and a low switch error rate
(Supplementary Fig. 18 and 19).

Author Manuscript

To measure the frequency of new mutations in the HeLa genome, we examined amplified
haplotypes for de facto somatic mutations occurring during tumorigenesis or early in the cell
line’s subsequent passaging. Within LOH regions, these appear as polymorphisms; 2,883
such sites (mean, 1.31 per haploid Mb; Supplementary Table 14) were confirmed by clone
pool sequencing and shotgun allele frequency (Supplementary Fig. 20 and 21). In non-LOH
regions, where one haplotype is amplified but both remain present, the majority of observed
heterozygous sites are inherited, as reflected by their substantial overlap with 1000GP
variants (86.7%, n = 2,339,608). Excluding these and sites found in the 11 control genomes,
5,282 sites (mean, 1.32 per haploid Mb) remained at which clones differed in genotype
between the two or more amplified copies of the same germline haplotype, with little
regional variation in the abundance (Supplementary Fig. 22). In sum, 8,165 somatic
mutations were validated with an estimated sensitivity of 61.1%, placing an upper bound on
the point-mutational burden sustained by HeLa CCL-2 after aneuploidy. Despite many
additional doublings in culture, this point mutational frequency (2.16 per Mb) is on the
lower end of frequencies observed across different cancer genomes22. However, without
estimates for parameters such as the number of doublings during tumorigenesis, the count of
cells explanted, and the number of passages in culture, this estimate of post-aneuploidy
mutational burden cannot be rescaled to a rate per base per division.

Four years after the immortalization of HeLa, several additional strains were cloned23. One
of these, HeLa S3, remains in widespread use today and has been profiled extensively as
part of the ENCODE Project. To investigate the divergence between CCL-2 and S3, we
performed shotgun sequencing of S3 to 26X coverage. Outside of S3-specific regions of
LOH, 94.5% of rare variants in CCL-2 were shared with S3 (n = 204,841 sites excluding
1000GP and segmental duplications, and requiring ≥ 8X coverage in each genome;
Supplementary Fig. 23, Supplementary Table 15). Somatic mutations were also shared,
though to a lesser degree: 72.4% of clone-confirmed somatic mutations from CCL-2 were
found in S3 (n = 8,054 sites with ≥ 8X coverage in S3), consistent with a low rate of somatic
SNV accumulation since the strains diverged in 1955.
The copy number profile of HeLa S3 broadly mirrors that of CCL-2 (Figure 1b,
Supplementary Figs. 7 and 24) as well as eight additional HeLa strains that we sequenced
lightly. We observed some strain-specific differences (Supplementary Figs. 25–27),
consistent with previous reports of karyotypic heterogeneity both among and within strains.
Despite some variability, copy number three was consistently the dominant state, comprising
a median of 52% of the genome across the eight strains (range 38–60%), similar to its

prevalence in CCL-2 (61%). Gains or losses of entire chromosome arms were observed
(e.g., chr18q, HeLa S3, Figure 1b, chr9p, CCL-13; Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29), but
smaller amplifications and deletions were more common. These may correspond to
variability in copy rather than content of marker chromosomes present, as suggested by high
overall breakpoint concordance between strains (81% of copy number breakpoints within ±
1 Mb were present in ≥ 2 strains). The additional eight cell lines analyzed here were
identified in the 1970s24 as products of HeLa contamination into other tissue cultures in the
preceding two decades. Their shared set of structural abnormalities reflects their common
origin from small founder populations of contaminating cells and reinforces the view that
the structural rearrangements resulting in marker chromosomes arose early and are variable
in copy number.

Nearly all cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Within
HeLa, a partial copy of the HPV type 18 (HPV-18) genome is integrated at a known fragile
site on chromosome 8q24.2125,26. Haplotype and copy number maps indicate the flanking
regions are present at copy number four, at a haplotype ratio of 3:1. To characterize the
structure and copy number of the insertion, we included the HPV-18 genome alongside the
human reference during alignment of clone pool reads. By analyzing patterns of coverage
from breakpoint-spanning fosmid clones, read depth data, and breakpoint sequencing, we
generated a structural model for the viral integration (Figure 2a,b, Supplementary Figs. 30
and 31). Two repeat structures (which we designate R1 and R2) consisting of the partial
viral genome are interspersed with regions of human chromosome 8q24.21 genomic DNA.
The viral genome is present with identical breakpoints on each copy of the amplified
haplotype, to the exclusion of the other haplotype, which remains at single copy and lacks
integration-associated rearrangements, confirming that integration and rearrangement
preceded amplification. The integrated structure contains only two-thirds of the complete
HPV-18 genome, including full-length copies of the E6 and E7 oncogenes necessary for
telomerase activity (amplified to CN 12), but lacking a functional copy of E2, an inhibitor of
E6 and E713 (Figure 2c). Additionally, a distinct portion of the HPV-18 genome, amplified
to CN 30 in HeLa, includes an epithelial-specific enhancer that controls E6 and E7
transcription27, possibly contributing to their high expression (Supplementary Fig. 32).

Author Manuscript

Extensive sequencing-based functional genomic data have been generated on HeLa and
other cancer cell lines by the ENCODE Project7, but these have the potential to be
misinterpreted if their analysis does not account for aneuploidy and phase. As HeLa CCL-2
and S3 are nearly identical in genotype, we used haplotype and copy number maps of
CCL-2 to assign phase to publicly available functional data generated on S37, including
transcription factor binding, chromatin modification, and chromatin accessibility datasets.
We also calculated haplotype-specific gene expression scores using RNA-Seq data
generated for this study and by others6,7 (Supplementary Figs. 33–35). For each dataset,
aligned reads were phased by comparison to HeLa CCL-2 haplotype blocks. Corresponding
peak scores (ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) or gene expression values (RNA-Seq) called from
the full set of reads were divided proportionally based on the abundance of phaseinformative mapping to each haplotype, normalized to each haplotype’s estimated copy
number. Mapping to the human reference genome imposed a slight bias, favoring the

reference allele by an average of 1.08-fold. We constructed two HeLa-specific reference
sequences by introducing all SNVs from each haplotype onto one or the other; mapping to
this reference mitigated most of the bias (to 1.02-fold, or a 75% reduction; Supplementary
Figs. 36–38).

Across the HeLa genome, gene expression is significantly correlated with copy number
(Figure 3a,b), suggesting a minimal role for gene dosage buffering. Moreover, on average,
each haplotype copy makes a comparable contribution to the transcriptome despite uneven
amplification and, in some cases, rearrangement (Figure 3c,e). This trend is also observed
for histone modifications, DNase hypersensitivity, and transcription factor binding
(Supplementary Figs. 39 and 40). Transcript allele balances at sites heterozygous in CCL-2
on chromosome 18q closely followed the genomic balance (mean 66% representation of the
A allele; expected 2/3), but S3 nearly exclusively matched the A allele (94% of reads),
reflecting the S3-specific LOH event (Figure 3d). A small number of regions, however,
exhibited strong imbalance between each haplotype’s contribution to overall patterns of
expression, chromatin modification, and transcription factor binding (2.4% of ENCODE
peaks not in LOH regions; Supplementary Figs. 41–44). Interestingly, the HPV-18 insertion
locus and proto-oncogene MYC (separated by ~500 Kb) were among the regions with the
most highly haplotype-imbalanced regulation in the genome (Supplementary Fig. 45).
Phased RNA-Seq data indicate that MYC is highly expressed, but almost exclusively from
the HPV-18-integrated haplotype (mean ratio, 95:1; Figure 4b, Supplementary Fig. 46).
Phased ENCODE tracks and long-range chromatin interaction data (ChIA-PET28; Figure 4a,
Supplementary Fig. 47) across the region indicate that transcription factor occupancy, active
chromatin marks, and long-distance physical contacts are also nearly exclusive to the HPVintegrated, transcriptionally active haplotype. Taken together, these data implicate viral
integration as a strong activator of MYC expression29, acting in cis rather than trans and
possibly mediated by the epithelial-specific viral enhancer amplified to CN 30 within the R1
repeat structure (Figure 2b)27. This strong cis interaction - between the amplified, integrated
genome of a DNA tumor virus and a canonical proto-oncogene - may underlie the robust
growth characteristics of the HeLa cell line, and also provides indirect support for the
hypothesis that inherited risk loci for cancer at chromosome 8q24 operate through activation
of MYC30.
In summary, we present the first haplotype-resolved genome of a human cancer, and the first
directly haplotype-resolved epigenome. Our study serves not only as an overdue genomic
analysis of arguably the most commonly used human cell line in biomedical research, but
also as a demonstration of the unique view into a cancer genome and epigenome enabled by
the acquisition of haplotype information.

supplemented with FBS to 10% and a 1X final concentration of pen-strep antibiotic (Gibco).
Shotgun sequencing, alignment, and variant calling

Author Manuscript

All shotgun libraries were constructed using standard ligation chemistry methods and
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome
(hg19, b37) using BWA31 followed by duplicate removal, quality score recalibration, and
local indel realignment using GATK32. Single-nucleotide variants were called using
samtools33, indel variants were called using GATK32, and Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)
were called using LobSTR34 (Supplementary Note 1). Indel detection as a function of
coverage was further investigated as described in Supplementary Note 2. Gene Ontology
(GO) term analysis was performed using DAVID35.
Read depth copy number analysis

Author Manuscript

Shotgun reads for HeLa and Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) control genomes8
along with a similarly prepared control library with a matched G+C profile were aligned
using mrsFAST36 processed as previously described in Sudmant et. al. (2010)37 to generate
read depth-based copy number predictions within non-overlapping windows of singly
unique nucleotide k-mers (“SUNK” windows; Supplementary Note 3). Copy number calling
in HeLa was performed at high (~1.5 kb) and low (~77 kb) resolution using an HMM
(Supplementary Note 4) followed by a recalibration process to account for widespread
aneuploidy (Supplementary Note 5). Short amplifications and deletions were identified
using a sliding window approach (Supplementary Note 6). Copy number calling was also
performed on HeLa S3 at both high and low resolutions as well as the eight additional HeLa
strains at low resolution and profiles compared between strains (Supplementary Note 7).
Regions of LOH were identified using a two-state HMM that utilized the fraction of
homozygous SNVs in non-repetitive regions across low resolution copy number windows
described above (Supplementary Note 8).
Mate pair library construction, sequencing, and analysis

Author Manuscript

Library construction for 40-kilobase mate pair libraries was carried out starting with fosmid
clone DNA pooled within each original fosmid preparation following a protocol similar to
Gnerre et. al. (2011)38 (Supplementary Note 9). Libraries of ~3 kb inserts were constructed
following protocols described in Talkowski et. al. (2011)39 (Supplementary Note 9).
Following read trimming and alignment, reads were split into classes based on aligned
orientation and insert size, and processed using in sliding windows to identify regions likely
structural rearrangements (Supplementary Note 10).

Fosmid pool construction, sequencing, and haplotype phasing

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Three replicate fosmid libraries were prepared as previously described in Kitzman et. al.
20115 followed by partitioning by limited dilution into 96 sub-libraries, outgrowth, barcoded
transposase-based library preparation40, sequencing and alignment (Supplementary Note
11). Clone boundaries were inferred as previously described5 and base calls were made at all
heterozygous variant positions as ascertained from whole-genome shotgun sequencing.
Overlapping clones were merged to consensus haplotype blocks using an implementation of
the ReFHap algorithm41 (Supplementary Note 12). Within the majority of the HeLa genome
in which haplotypes are unequally amplified, adjacent blocks were merged to create
scaffolds, using an HMM that finds the most likely phase of neighboring blocks given their
shotgun allele frequencies of inherited variants (those found within the 1000 Genomes
Project, Supplementary Note 12). This produced a final set of haplotype scaffolds with an
N50 size of 44.8 Mb, which was then used in conjunction with copy number calls to
estimate haplotype-resolved copy number (HRCN) for HeLa (Supplementary Note 13).
Haplotype scaffolds were analyzed for variant population frequencies to investigate the
ancestral origin of phased blocks (Supplementary Note 14). Lastly, overall copy number was
compared between all HeLa strains sequenced in this study (Supplementary Note 15)
Long read phase validation

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA from HeLa CCL-2 was mechanically sheared using a Covaris G-tube
column and standard microcentrifuge following the manufacturer’s instructions, yielding a
mean fragment size of ~10 kb. Single-molecule real-time sequencing libraries for the Pacific
Biosciences RS sequencer were prepared using the Pacific Biosciences DNA Template Prep
Kit (3-10 kb), and the resulting library was sequenced across 8 cells using a 90 minute
movie. Resulting basecalls were aligned to the genome with bwasw (using parameters “-b5 q2 -r1 -z1”). Reads overlapping at least two phased SNPs were considered, excluding those
within +/− 10bp of an insertion or deletion in the alignment.
Identification of putative post-aneuploidy mutations
We searched for candidate somatic post-aneuploidy mutations by taking the initial set of
SNVs called from the shotgun sequencing data and filtering to remove likely germline
variants. SNVs were identified which were phased on a duplicated haplotype but were
polymorphic between the two duplicated copies. Common polymorphisms and sequencing
artifacts were removed by filtering against repeat annotations and control genomes
(Supplementary Note 16).
HPV-18 insertion characterization

Author Manuscript

The HPV-18 integration locus was characterized by aligning all fosmid libraries to a
modified genome which included the HPV-18 reference genome as an additional
chromosome. Interchromosomal read pairs, fosmid pool coverage profiles, and copy number
calls were used to determine the repeat structure of the chromosome 8q24.21 – HPV-18
integration locus. PCR primers were then designed to amplify the proposed breakpoints
followed by sequencing for base-pair resolution (Supplementary Note 17).

ENCODE and RNA-Seq phasing

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Directional, PolyA+ RNA-Seq data generated in-house on HeLa S3 (Supplementary Note
18) was analyzed along with publically available ENCODE epigenomics and
transcriptomics data downloaded from the online data portal for HeLa S3 as well as RNASeq on HeLa CCL-2 presented in Nagaraj et. al. (2011)6 (Supplementary Note 19). RNASeq reads were aligned using TopHat42 and transcript quantification performed using
Cufflinks43. Haplotype phasing was performed by genotyping aligned sequence data for all
phased SNVs and assigning haplotype contribution to either peaks (epigenomics data sets)
or RPKM (RNA-Seq data sets) followed by copy number normalization (Supplementary
Note 20). Reference bias was investigated in all tracks and removed in a subset to identify
its impact on outlier calling (Supplementary Note 21). Haplotype-specific peaks were then
identified in all data tracks (Supplementary Note 22). Lastly, a meta-analysis of all data
tracks was used to identify large regions of haplotype imbalance (Supplementary Note 23).

Figure 1. Haplotype-resolved copy number of the HeLa cancer cell line genome

Author Manuscript

a. Copy-number profile of HeLa split by haplotypes (red = A, blue = B). Links denote likely
contiguity and tandem duplications. Boxes indicate marker chromosomes identified by copy
number breakpoints (boxes colored by haplotype, or black for unknown); ‘S’ indicates links
confirmed by mate-pair sequencing and italics indicate uncertain locations. b. Windowed
copy number ratios for HeLa CCL-2 (green and purple, alternating chromosomes) and HeLa
S3 (gray), with predicted integer copy number for S3 (black). Notable strain differences are
indicated by red arrows (e.g., reduced copy over chromosome 18q). The window containing
the HPV insertion and rearrangement is at elevated copy in both strains.

Figure 3. Gene expression by copy number and haplotype in HeLa S3

Author Manuscript

a. Transcript abundance (reads per kilobase per million, RPKM, for genes with an RPKM ≥
1) is positively correlated with gene copy. b. Expression per copy (RPKM / gene copynumber) does not correlate with copy number. c. Fractional contribution of haplotype A to
overall expression (RPKM averaged across megabase windows at phased sites) split by
haplotype-resolved copy number. Open circles indicate expected fractions. d. Haplotype Aspecific expression in HeLa S3 but not CCL-2 across S3-specific LOH on chr18q. e.
Haplotype A fractional contribution to expression across the genome, color-coded by
underlying haplotype-resolved copy number as in c (point size represents the log2 total
RPKM, gray boxes indicate HeLa S3 LOH).
