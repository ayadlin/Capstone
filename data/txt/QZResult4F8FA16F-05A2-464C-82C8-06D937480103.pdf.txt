BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the most common complementary and alternative medicines used in
the treatment of patients with breast cancer. However, the clinical effect of TCM on survival, which is a major concern in these individuals, lacks evidence from large-scale clinical studies. METHODS: The authors used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research
Database to conduct a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with advanced breast cancer between 2001 and
2010. The patients were separated into TCM users and nonusers, and Cox regression models were applied to determine the association between the use of TCM and patient survival. RESULTS: A total of 729 patients with advanced breast cancer receiving taxanes
were included in the current study. Of this cohort, the mean age was 52.0 years; 115 patients were TCM users (15.8%) and 614 patients
were TCM nonusers. The mean follow-up was 2.8 years, with 277 deaths reported to occur during the 10-year period. Multivariate
analysis demonstrated that, compared with nonusers, the use of TCM was associated with a significantly decreased risk of all-cause
mortality (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 0.55 [95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.90] for TCM use of 30-180 days; adjusted HR, 0.46 [95%
confidence interval, 0.27-0.78] for TCM use of > 180 days). Among the frequently used TCMs, those found to be most effective (lowest HRs) in reducing mortality were Bai Hua She She Cao, Ban Zhi Lian, and Huang Qi. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current
observational study suggest that adjunctive TCM therapy may lower the risk of death in patients with advanced breast cancer. Future

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor in female patients worldwide and the leading cause of death in
women with cancer, accounting for approximately 1.38 million new diagnoses and 458,400 deaths every year.1 Although
patient incidence and mortality are decreasing in some countries, the mortality rate of advanced breast cancer remains
high.2 The current treatment for patients with advanced breast cancer includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and
hormonal and targeted biological therapies.3 Recent studies have documented that at least 46% of patients with breast
cancer receive complementary and alternative medicine treatments4,5 to boost immune system activity, decrease disease
symptoms, minimize side effects resulting from conventional treatments, increase quality of life, and even as a treatment
of cancer per se.6
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative medicine therapies used by patients with breast cancer worldwide.7,8 Although studies have indicated that TCM facilitates the treatment

TCM and Survival of Patients With Breast Ca/Lee et al

of breast cancer, to the best of our knowledge, the majority of the reports on the alleviation of side effects by chemotherapy and hormonal therapy originate from laboratory
findings.9-11 Patients are mostly concerned about disease
mortality arising from the progression of cancer; however,
to our knowledge large-scale clinical analysis of TCM on
disease mortality in patients with breast cancer remains
absent. In Taiwan, TCM is covered by National Health
Insurance (NHI) and is a widely accepted form of medical
treatment. According to the study by Lai et al, in addition
to receiving conventional therapy, approximately 81.5%
of patients with breast cancer in Taiwan had ever received
any treatment with TCM during the 10-year study period.12 Using the population-based National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), we investigated
whether the combination of TCM and conventional cancer treatment affected the survival of patients with
advanced breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Research Database

The NHI system in Taiwan is a compulsory, single-payer
program that provides health coverage to nearly every
individual in Taiwan. Currently, 99.6% of residents are
covered by NHI.13 The Bureau of National Health Insurance allowed a random selection of 1 million representative patient records from the NHIRD (23 million insured
individuals) to be distributed for research. The age, sex
distribution, and premiums paid were not found to be
statistically significantly different between the 1 million
insured individuals and the general population.14 In the
current retrospective population-based cohort study, we
analyzed 1 million patients randomly selected from 23
million beneficiaries in the NHIRD between January 1,
1999 and December 31, 2010. The NHIRD contains
comprehensive outpatient and inpatient information
including age, sex, date of visit, International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9CM) codes, and complete prescription records. The
detailed diagnoses and treatments provided by Chinese
medicine physicians were also included. This study was
approved by the Joint Institutional Review Board of Taipei Medical University.

cancer must be confirmed by specialists and pathological
reports as was the case in the current study. Once patients
fulfill the above-mentioned conditions, physicians and
medical institutions must provide assistance to the patient
to apply for the catastrophic illness certificate. The status
of catastrophic illness is then registered into the NHI
card. The current study comprised women aged > 18
years who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer
(ICD-9-CM code 174) between 2001 and 2010.
Although the stage of disease of patients with breast cancer
cannot be obtained from the ICD-9-CM codes, we identified those patients with advanced breast cancer through
taxane prescriptions. We used this approach because the
Bureau of National Health Insurance reimburses taxane
use only for those patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients with advanced breast cancer
who received taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) treatments
between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2010 were
included in the current study. The initiation of taxane
treatment was defined as the index date. We obtained
detailed hospitalization, outpatient, and prescription information from 2 years before the index date to the end of
the follow-up period for analysis. Patients who received
taxane treatment before January 1, 2001 and those with a
follow-up period of < 3 months were excluded.
The baseline demographic variables of the patients
were obtained from the registry for beneficiary files, and
patient age was determined according to the index date.
The baseline comorbidities were determined using the
modified version of the Elixhauser comorbidity index15
according to the patient medical records 2 years before the
index date. These comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic
pulmonary disease, and liver disease. Distant metastases
were defined as metastases to the lungs, liver, brain, bones,
and other organs (ICD-9-CM codes 197.x, 198.0, 198.1,
and 198.3-198.7). The type of treatment was considered
as the treatment that a patient with breast cancer received
2 years before the index date until the end of the followup period. A patient undergoing both mastectomy and
breast-conserving surgery was classified under mastectomy. Combination chemotherapy was defined as when
patients received other chemotherapy medications in
addition to taxanes.

prescribed by board-certified Chinese medicine physicians who received rigorous training in both Chinese and
Western medicine in medical schools and through residency programs in hospitals. These physicians must also
pass the national licensing examinations. TCMs are prescribed by Chinese medicine physicians according to
TCM symptom patterns.10 Patients using TCM for  30
days due to a diagnosis of breast cancer were defined as
TCM users, whereas those treated for < 30 days were considered as TCM nonusers. Moreover, to observe a doseresponse relationship, we further grouped TCM users
into 2 groups: 1 group used TCM for 30 to 180 days
whereas the other group used TCM for > 180 days.
Study Outcome

The study outcome was all-cause mortality during the 10year follow-up. The patient’s date of death was determined
according to the Registry of Catastrophic Illness Database
of the NHIRD. The analysis period began from the index
date and ended at the death of patient, withdrawal from
NHI, or the end of 2010, whichever occurred first.
Statistical Analysis

The continuous variables were summarized using means
and standard deviations, whereas the categorical variables
were summarized using counts and percentages. The continuous variables of the baseline characteristics of TCM
1340

users and nonusers were analyzed using a Student t test,
and the categorical variables were analyzed using a chisquare or Fisher exact test. The cumulative probability of
survival for TCM users and nonusers was estimated using
a Kaplan-Meier estimator16 with a log-rank test17 used to
compare the survival curves between the groups. The association between the baseline characteristics and mortality
was estimated using a univariate Cox regression analysis18
and reported according to hazards ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs). The variables with P values < .2 in the univariate analysis were included in the
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to identify
the independent predictors of mortality. Log(-log[survival])
versus log of survival time plot was inspected to verify the
proportional hazards assumption. The study endpoint was
all-cause mortality. Patients who were alive at the time of
last follow-up were censored at the date of withdrawal
from NHI or the end of study period, whichever came
first. To verify the dose-response relationship between
TCM use and mortality, we treated TCM use category as
a continuous variable to calculate the P value of the linear
trend. Because stage of cancer is a major predictor of mortality, we conducted a sensitivity analysis limiting to
patients with distant metastases to evaluate the robustness
of our findings. Statistical significance was determined as
P < .05. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

TCM and Survival of Patients With Breast Ca/Lee et al

RESULTS
Of the 1 million people randomly selected from the
NHIRD between 2001 and 2010, 786 female patients
were aged > 18 years and received taxane treatment
because of primary breast cancer. We further excluded 5
patients who received taxane treatment before January 1,
2001 and 52 patients with a follow-up period of < 3
months. Of the remaining 729 eligible patients, 614 were
TCM nonusers, whereas the remaining 115 patients were
TCM users, including 58 users who took TCM for 30 to
180 days and 57 users who used it for > 180 days. Characteristics such as age, urbanization, baseline comorbidity,
and treatment did not appear to differ significantly
between the groups (Table 1).

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in patients
with advanced breast cancer according to traditional Chinese
medicine (TCM) use during the follow-up period.

The mean follow-up period for the patients was 2.8
years 6 1.9 years; 277 deaths occurred and the overall
mortality rate was 38.0% during the analysis period.
TCM users had 32 deaths (27.8%) and TCM nonusers
had 245 deaths (39.9%). The Kaplan-Meier survival
curve and log-rank test revealed a statistically significant
difference between the survival curves of the groups
(P < .001) (Fig. 1).
The unadjusted Cox regression analysis demonstrated a strong association between the use of TCM and a
decrease in mortality (Table 2). Compared with TCM
nonusers, TCM users had reduced mortality by 47%
(unadjusted HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.77 [P < .001]).
On the multivariate Cox model controlling for 6 potential
confounders (age, history of congestive heart failure, distant metastases, surgery, hormonal or targeted biologic
therapy, and radiotherapy), the use of TCM remained
highly associated with decreased mortality (the adjusted
HR of TCM users was 0.50 [95% CI, 0.35-0.73];
P < .001) (Table 2).
Further analysis demonstrated a dose-response relationship between TCM use and mortality. The adjusted
HRs were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.33-0.90) and 0.46 (95% CI,
0.27-0.78) for patients with TCM use of 30 to 180 days
and > 180 days, respectively. The longer the duration of
TCM use, the lower the mortality rate (P for trend
< .001). The other independent predictors of increased
mortality included distant metastases, inoperable surgical
status, and radiotherapy.
Similar results were obtained when analyses were restricted to patients with distant metastases. Of the 269

patients with distant metastases, after adjusting for age,
history of congestive heart failure, surgery, hormonal or
targeted biologic therapy, and radiotherapy, TCM use
was still associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR
0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.67 [P < .001]) when compared
with nonuse of TCM.
The most common prescriptions of the 115 TCM
users were Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Pu Gong Ying, and Bai
Hua She She Cao, which were used by 57 TCM users
(49.6%), 51 TCM users (44.3%), and 50 TCM users
(43.5%), respectively (Table 3). Of the 10 most common
TCMs, 3 were herbal formulae and 7 were single herbs.
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated
that the 3 most effective (lowest HRs) TCM agents in
reducing mortality were Bai Hua She She Cao, Ban Zhi
Lian, and Huang Qi (Table 4). By contrast, the results of
the current analysis revealed Dan Shen, Xiang Sha Liu Jun
Zi Tang, and Ban Xia were not significantly associated with
reduced mortality.
DISCUSSION
Clinical studies on the therapeutic effects of TCM in
patients with breast cancer remain scant, and to the best of
our knowledge the majority are either case discussions or
1342

descriptive outcomes of a few patients.9 To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, nationwide cohort study
investigating the association between adjunctive TCM
therapy and the survival of patients with advanced breast
cancer. Our findings on the effects of TCM on the mortality of patients with breast cancer were similar to those
of a population-based study that determined an association between the use of ginseng and survival in these
patients.19 By contrast, another study on herbal remedies
(TCM and non-TCM) concluded that such remedies did
not improve survival in patients with breast cancer.20
The most common herbal formulae used by patients
in the current study were similar to another study of
patients with all stages of breast cancer in Taiwan.12
According to the concepts of TCM, cancer is a systemic
disease formed when the internal functions of the body
become imbalanced, which cause toxin accumulation or
heat and blood stasis in the body, and this situation eventually leads to the body becoming incapable of resisting
external carcinogenic factors.10 The commonly used
TCMs aim to treat patient symptoms according to the
TCM functional classifications are shown in Table 3.

fatigue, and menopausal syndromes,21-23 whereas other
studies observed that Jia Wei Xiao Yao San and Xiang Sha
Liu Jun Zi Tang ameliorate functional dyspepsia.24,25
Apart from the herbal formulae, we also identified the
commonly used single herbs. Most of these single herbs
were often used to treat cancer in Chinese medicine.26
Recent evidence has demonstrated that the identified
TCMs have anticancer effects in vitro27-32 and promising
clinical effects in patients.33 Among them, Pu Gong Ying,
Bai Hua She She Cao, Dan Shen, Ji Xue Teng, and Ban
Zhi Lian have antiproliferative effects on breast cancer
cells.27,28,30,31 In addition to anticancer effects, some of the
TCMs identified in the current study have been shown to
modulate immunity,34 inflammation,35 osteogenesis,36
hematopoiesis,37 and neuroprotection,38,39 suggesting that
in addition to improving patient survival, they also relieve
symptoms related to breast cancer or side effects from
conventional treatments, and improve quality of life.
Several differences exist between the current study
and previous population-based studies. First, the current
study data were extracted from a single, large nationwide
database with 1 million representative beneficiaries who
were randomly selected with minimal selection bias. Second, because TCM is covered by NHI, it was possible to
obtain the full TCM prescription records for the patients,
which contain data regarding drug names, dose, and days
of administration, thus preventing potential recall bias.
Moreover, a complete list of TCMs was collected from the
database to elucidate the effects of each medicine on
patients with breast cancer, which is more comprehensive
than merely studying a particular TCM. Third, the TCMs
analyzed in the current study were prescribed by boardcertified Chinese medicine physicians, and were not TCMs
freely acquired by patients. All TCMs covered by NHI
Cancer

must be manufactured by pharmaceutical companies with
good manufacturing practice compliant with the regulatory
requirements of the central health authority and therefore,
the quality and safety of TCMs are ensured. Finally, the
study patients were restricted to patients with advanced
breast cancer who had similar levels of disease severity,
therefore mitigating confounding by indication.40
Several limitations must be considered. First, the
NHI program only pays for TCMs prescribed by Chinese
medicine physicians, not over-the-counter TCMs. Therefore, the use of TCM may be underestimated. Second, it
is likely that TCM users were not fully compliant with
prescriptions. However, we were still able to demonstrate
the mortality benefit from TCM use. Third, the NHIRD
is a claims-based database; therefore, no detailed clinical
information regarding cancer staging or biochemical data
are recorded. Finally, because the Registry of Catastrophic
Illness Database of the NHIRD only documents the date
of death and not cause of death, the effect of TCM on
breast cancer-specific mortality cannot be analyzed.
The results of the current observational study suggest that adjunctive therapy with TCM may improve the
survival of patients with advanced breast cancer who are
receiving taxanes. The current study suggests that TCM
may be used as an integral element of effective therapy for
cancer. Future randomized controlled trials are required
to validate these observational findings.
