ABSTRACT:
This study evaluated the effects of a modern antagonistic analog of GHRH on
tumor growth and on expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in two models of
human triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). The TNBC subtype is refractory to
the treatment options available for other hormone-independent breast cancers.
Inflammatory cytokines play a major role in the cellular signaling associated with
breast cancer pathogenesis and enhance epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT),
drug resistance, and metastatic potential. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)
is a hypothalamic neuropeptide which regulates the synthesis and release of growth
hormone by the pituitary and is an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for multiple
human cancers. The effects of analogs of GHRH on tumoral cytokine expression have
not been previously investigated. Animals bearing xenografts of the human TNBC
cell lines, HCC1806 and MX-1, were treated with MIA-602, an antagonistic analog of
GHRH. Treatment with MIA-602 significantly reduced tumor growth. We quantified
transcript levels of the genes for several inflammatory cytokines. Expression of INFγ,
IL-1α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα, was significantly reduced by treatment
with MIA-602. We conclude that treatment of TNBC with GHRH antagonists reduces
tumor growth through an action mediated by tumoral GHRH receptors and produces a
suppression of inflammatory cytokine signaling. Silencing of GHRH receptors in vitro
with siRNA inhibited the expression of GHRH-R genes and inflammatory cytokine
genes in HCC1806 and MX-1 cells. Further studies on GHRH antagonists may facilitate
the development of new strategies for the treatment of resistant cancers.

INTRODUCTION

as a result of their malignancy.[1] These figures can be
extrapolated to approximately 4 million new cases and
820,000 deaths per year, worldwide. Breast cancer is a
very heterogeneous disease and encompasses several
distinct entities. The subtype defined as triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) is negative for estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and the human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (Her2). TNBC accounts for 10-15%

Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality in
Hispanic and African-American women and the second
most common cause of cancer-related death in Caucasian
women. In the United States alone, nearly 200,000 women
are afflicted with breast cancer each year and 41,000 die

of all breast cancer cases. This phenotype is hereditary,
more invasive, affects younger women, and has a much
poorer prognosis than other phenotypes.[2] Triple
negative breast cancers are refractory to the treatment
options available for other hormone-independent breast
cancers, which are negative for estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor but positive for Her2. This accounts
for the low survivability of TNBC.[3] Alternate treatment
strategies must therefore be devised to address this clinical
deficiency.
Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to
play a major role in the cellular signaling involved in
breast cancer pathogenesis.[4-6] Increased expression
of inflammatory cytokines correlates with higher tumor
grade and greater metastatic potential, both of which
predict poorer survival. Inflammatory cytokines also
enhance drug resistance in breast cancer.[7] Among
the roles of cytokines in breast cancer is their ability to

regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT).
[8, 9] In the course of EMT, expression of intercellular
adhesion molecules and other characteristics of an
epithelial phenotype is lost, and cells acquire a stemcell-like or “mesenchymal” phenotype. This phenotype
is highly motile and possesses stem-cell-like properties
including a high degree of resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation. In addition to cancer stem-cell development and
regulation of treatment resistance, EMT is the principal
mechanism involved in metastasis and tumor invasion.
[10-12] Disruption of the signaling pathways involved in
EMT may therefore provide an effective treatment strategy
for currently difficult to treat or untreatable cancers such
as TNBC.
The potential use of neuropeptide analogs for the
treatment of cancer has long been established.[13-15]
Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a peptide
hormone, secreted by the hypothalamus, which regulates

the synthesis and release of growth hormone by the
pituitary.[16, 17] Growth hormone subsequently stimulates
the release of hepatic insulin-like growth factor, which
is a major anabolic growth factor and a potent mitogen
for many neoplasms.[17-20] Biologically active GHRH,
mRNA for GHRH, GHRH receptors (GHRH-R), and
GHRH-R splice variants have been identified in surgical
specimens and tumor cell lines of a multitude of human
cancers, including various types of breast cancer [21-28].
GHRH acts as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor in
human cancers [16, 29-31] including breast [32]. Pituitarytype GHRH-R and splice variant 1 of GHRH-R appear
to mediate the direct effects of GHRH and its analogs on
tumors [33]. In vitro and in vivo proliferation of various
human cancers is suppressed by antagonistic analogs of
GHRH (referred to as “GHRH antagonists”) [19, 34-36].
These findings further support the concept of GHRH as a
growth factor for clinical cancer.
In vivo studies have demonstrated the anti-tumor
activity of GHRH antagonists against multiple cancer
types [16, 29]. Studies of GHRH antagonists on prostate
and lung cancers demonstrated the ability to modulate
signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation,
survival, metastasis, and apoptosis [31, 37-39]. Among
the affected pathways is the PI3K-AKT, which regulates
inflammatory cytokines through NF-κβ.[37, 38] Treatment
resistance in breast cancer is enhanced by activation of the
NF-κβ pathway by inflammatory. [40, 41] In vivo studies
of the effects of GHRH antagonists on benign prostatic
hyperplasia, a partially inflammatory condition, resulted in
significant decreases in prostate size after treatment [42].
Analyses indicate that treatment with GHRH antagonists
suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).[42, 43] These

results also support the hypothesis that GHRH antagonists
will suppress the expression of the inflammatory cytokines
associated with breast cancer.
In this study, the human TNBC cell lines, HCC1806
and MX-1, were xenografted into nude mice to evaluate
the effects of the GHRH antagonist MIA-602 on tumor
growth and inflammatory cytokine gene expression.
The animals were treated daily with subcutaneous
injections of MIA-602 for five weeks, at which time
tumors were collected for gene expression analysis. To
confirm the effects of the GHRH antagonist on cytokine
gene expression, cultures of HCC1806 and MX-1 were
treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence
the expression of GHRH-R genes. One-step real-time
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression of
inflammatory cytokine genes.

analyzed.

Effect of GHRH-R Gene Silencing on GHRH
mRNA and GHRH-R mRNA Expression by
HCC1806 and MX-1 Human TNBC Cell Lines.

Silencing of GHRH-R genes with siRNA suppressed
the expression of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA by
cells of HCC1806 and MX-1 human TNBC. Expression
levels of IFNγ mRNA and TNFα mRNA by silenced cells
of HCC1806 were 93.2% (±1.2%) and 24.5% (±6.6%)
less than in the control group, respectively. Expression
of mRNA for IL-1α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 genes
was 16.0% (±9.0%), 81.5% (±2.9%), 32.0% (±15.4%),
32.4% (±10.0%), and 86.4% (±7.2%) lower than in
control, respectively (figure 5a). Silencing of HCC1806
cells with GHRH-R siRNA resulted in significant (P <
0.01) reductions in the expression of mRNA for all genes
analyzed with the exception of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6.
Expression levels of IFNγ mRNA and TNFα
mRNA by silenced cells of MX-1 were 45.5% (±16.9%)
and 17.9% (±11.6%) smaller than the in control group,
respectively. Expression of mRNA for IL-1α, IL-4, IL6, IL-8, and IL-10 genes was 24.1% (±10.5%), 37.4%
(±16.0%), 22.2% (±15.8%), 3.4% (±12.5%), and 66.9%
(±6.0%) lower than in control, respectively (figure 5b).
Silencing of MX-1 cells with GHRH-R siRNA resulted
in significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the expression of
mRNA for all genes analyzed with the exception of TNFα,
IL-6, and IL-8.

Expression levels of mRNA for GHRH and
GHRH-R was determined after silencing the expression
of GHRH-R genes with siRNA and culturing the cells for
seven days. Expression of GHRH mRNA and GHRH-R
mRNA by HCC1806 human TNBC cells was significantly
(P < 0.01) suppressed by silencing of GHRH-R genes with
siRNA. Cells of HCC1806 expressed 48.7% (±11.2%) less
GHRH mRNA and 81.9% (±4.0%) less GHRH-R mRNA
than controls (figure 4a). This analysis indicates that the
silencing of GHRH-R genes with siRNA was 82% (±4%)
efficient.
Expression of GHRH mRNA by MX-1 human
TNBC cells was not significantly suppressed by silencing
of GHRH-R with siRNA. Contrarily, expression of
GHRH-R mRNA by MX-1 human TNBC cells was
significantly (P < 0.01) suppressed. Cells of MX-1
expressed 32.8% (±9.8%) less GHRH mRNA and 83.4%
(±1.7%) less GHRH-R mRNA than controls (figure 4b).
This analysis indicates that silencing of GHRH-R genes
in MX-1 human TNBC cells was 83% (±2%) efficient.

and receptor splice variants (SV) in carcinogenesis.
Proliferation of some human cancers in vitro is stimulated
by exogenous GHRH and suppressed by GHRH
antagonists or GHRH anti-sera.[44] Studies suggest that
dysregulation of GHRH expression or autocrine/paracrine
secretion contributes to the pathogenesis of breast and
other cancers.[45] In vivo studies have demonstrated the
anti-tumor activity of GHRH antagonists against multiple
cancer types. Studies of GHRH antagonists on prostate
and lung cancers demonstrated their ability to modulate
signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation,
survival, metastasis, and apoptosis. Among the affected
pathways is the PI3K-AKT pathway which regulates the
expression of inflammatory cytokines and the initiation of
EMT.[37, 38]
Several reports have detailed the effects of treatment
with GHRH antagonists on the growth of breast cancers.
[16, 28, 46, 47] However, the role of GHRH in the
regulation of inflammatory cytokine expression in triple
negative breast cancer has not been fully investigated. This
study illustrates the benefits of using GHRH antagonists
for the treatment of cancers which are highly treatmentresistant.
Inflammation is a key regulatory process in breast
cancer progression and severity. Inflammatory cytokines
are seldom or minimally expressed in the normal breast
epithelia, but they are significantly elevated in several
breast cancer subtypes.[48] In addition, relapse and
metastasis are associated with significantly increased and
prolonged expression of TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 indicating
progression-related roles for these cytokines.[8, 48] Other
studies have demonstrated that prolonged exposure of
breast tumor cells to inflammatory cytokines leads to

EMT, which is the principle mechanism associated with
generation of cancer stem-cells, development of treatment
resistance, and the initiation and progression of metastasis.
[7, 8, 11, 12]
Numerous studies have firmly established the
regulatory role of inflammatory cytokines in cancer.
[2, 4-8, 11, 48] We recently reported the reduction of
prostate size and suppression of inflammatory cytokines
by GHRH antagonists in an experimental BPH rodent
model.[42] This study supplements our previous work
by demonstrating similar effects on in vivo cytokine
gene expression in HCC1806 and MX-1 human TNBC.
Analysis of the mRNA levels of the genes expressed
by tumors treated with MIA-602 indicates suppressed
expression of tumoral inflammatory cytokines.
These results suggest that GHRH antagonists
can be used to inhibit the generation of cancer stem
cells, treatment resistance, and metastatic potential by
suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokine
genes. Given these conclusions, GHRH antagonists may
provide effective treatment of patients suffering from
difficult to treat or treatment resistant cancers such as
TNBC.

guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional animal care and usage committee (Chairman
Dr. Carlos Perez-Stable, Miami VA Medical Center).

Silencing of GHRH-R was accomplished by reverse
transfection using the siPORT NeoFX Transfection
Reagent and Silencer Select siRNA (Applied Biosystems).
Cells were trypsinized immediately before silencing.
Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10
minutes and the media removed. Cells were suspended to
a density of 105 cells/ml in fresh media containing 10%
FBS and antibiotic. RNA (1µM) was diluted 1:4 in optiMEM and 100µl of this solution combined with 100µl
of a 1:10 NeoFX solution for each well. Transfection
complexes were allowed to form for 15 minutes at room
temperature. In each well of a 6 well culture plate, 2ml of
cell suspension was combined with 200µl of complexes
and cultured at 37oC and 5% CO2 for 7 days, replacing the
medium and transfection complexes once.

Drugs and Chemicals.
The GHRH antagonistic analog, MIA-602, was
synthesized in our laboratory as previously described.
[18, 49] MIA-602 was dissolved in a 0.1% / 10% DMSO/
propylene glycol solution for daily subcutaneous injection.

Animals.
Female nude mice (Harlan Laboratories) between
10 and 11 weeks of age (20g body weight) were housed
in a climate-controlled environment with a 12-h light/
dark cycle and were fed standard laboratory diet with
water ad libitum. Body weights were determined weekly.
All animals remained healthy throughout the experiment.
Animal care was in accordance with institutional
guidelines and complied with National Institutes of Health
policy.

RNA Isolation.
Excised tumors were immediately cut into 25
mg pieces and submerged in RNAlater stabilization
solution. After an overnight incubation at 4oC, for
thorough stabilization, samples were homogenized in
lysis buffer, and total RNA was isolated using the GE
Illustra RNAspin Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Contaminating DNA was
eliminated with an on-column DNase treatment as part
of the isolation procedure. Total RNA was quantified and
assessed for purity using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific).

Cell Culture.
Cultures of the human triple negative breast cancer
cell line, HCC1806, were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cultures were
keep in a humidified incubator in a 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37oC. Growth medium was replaced every 72 hours for
two weeks. Cells were collected using 0.05% trypsin and
incubating at 37oC for 3 minutes. Trypsin was inactivated
with an equal volume of FBS containing medium and the
cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10
minutes.

SYBR Green-based RT-PCR Primer Design.
Gene expression was determined using qRT-PCR.
All RNA targets were analyzed using custom designed
oligonucleotide primers designed for use in SYBR green
based qRT-PCR. The assays were painstakingly designed
using extremely strict parameters in order to exclude
non-human (mouse) templates and target regions of low
energy secondary structures, maximizing both specificity
and sensitivity. All assays were determined to produce a
single product which was verified as the human target of
interest by DNA sequencing.
Transcript specific primers were designed using the
Beacon Designer software suite (Premiere Biosoft) with
modified parameters. Primer searches were limited to
regions on mRNA sequences (Refseqs) which were not
homologous to the equivalent mRNA from mice (Mus
musculus). The resulting human-specific sequences were
screened for regions of stable secondary structures (∆G
< -3.0 Kcal/mol), which were excluded from our primer
search. Primer searches were optimized for reverse
transcription at 52oC and fast cycling PCR with single step

Study Design.
Donor animals were injected subcutaneously
with 105 cells and tumors were allowed to grow for 4
weeks. The tumors were collected postmortem and cut
into approximately 5 mg fragments. Fragments were
rinsed with sterile PBS and xenografted subcutaneously
into both flanks of each study animal. Tumors were
allowed to grow to a mean volume of ~100 mm3 prior to
initiation of treatment. Animals were randomly assigned
to one of two experimental groups. The control group
remained untreated and the treated group received daily
subcutaneous injection of MIA-602 (5µg/day) for 5 weeks.
Tumor volume and body weight were assessed weekly.
All animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation upon
study completion. The tumors were collected postmortem
and immediately submerged in RNAlater stabilization
solution (Ambion).

annealing/extension at 57oC. Primer hairpin energy was
limited to ∆G = -3.0 Kcal/mol and dimer energies were
limited to ∆G = -4.0 Kcal/mol. Dimers including the last 3
bases of the 3’ end of the primer were limited to ∆G = -2.0
Kcal/mol. Primers were designed to result in amplicons
of 75-200 bp in length. Primer pairs that were less than
98% efficient were excluded. All primers used produce
a single product of predictable and reproducible melting

Res. 2011; 30(1):22.

Gene expression analysis was conducted using onestep qRT-PCR with SYBR green chemistry. This method
conducts the reverse transcription reaction and PCR in a
single tube format from 20ng total RNA template. The
production of the PCR amplified gene product is monitored
using the fluorescence resulting from the binding of SYBR
green to the double stranded DNA amplicons. Reactions
were conducted in a CFX96 Real-Time System using the
One-Step SYBR Green qRT-PCR reaction kit (Bio-Rad).
Reactions were conducted in triplicate and normalized to
three internal standard genes using the δδCt method.[50]
