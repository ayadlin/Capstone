Summary

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cells require nucleotides to support DNA replication and to repair damaged DNA. In addition to
de novo synthesis, cells recycle nucleotides from the DNA of dying cells or from cellular material
ingested through the diet. Salvaged nucleosides come with the complication that they can contain
epigenetic modifications. Since epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation mainly relies on
copying of the modification pattern from parental strands1-3, random incorporation of premodified bases during replication could have profound implications for epigenome fidelity and
yield adverse cellular phenotypes. Although the salvage mechanism of 5-methyl-2′deoxycytidine
(5mdC) has been investigated before4-6, currently it remains unknown how cells deal with the
recently identified oxidised forms of 5mdC – 5-hydroxymethyl-2′deoxycytidine (5hmdC), 5formy-2′deoxycytidine (5fdC) and 5-carboxyl-2′deoxycytidine (5cadC)7-10. Here we demonstrate
that enzymes of the nucleotide salvage pathway display substrate selectivity, effectively protecting
newly synthesized DNA from the incorporation of epigenetically modified forms of cytosine. Thus
cell lines and animals can tolerate high doses of these modified cytidines without any deleterious
effects on physiology. Interestingly, by screening cancer cell lines for growth defects following
exposure to 5hmdC, we unexpectedly identify a subset of cell lines where 5hmdC or 5fdC
administration leads to cell lethality. Using genomic approaches we discover that the susceptible
cell lines overexpress cytidine deaminase (CDA). CDA converts 5hmdC and 5fdC into variants of
uridine that are incorporated into DNA, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately,
cell death. Our observations extend current knowledge of the nucleotide salvage pathway by

Modified cytidines can enter deoxynucleotide pools, because salvage and nutrient uptake
pathways can recover nucleosides, rather than simpler degradation products such as uric acid
in the salvage of purines12. Previous biochemical work suggested that 5mdC is not
incorporated in the DNA, but is salvaged as thymidine4-6. Salvage of oxidised 5methylcytosine (5mCyt) variants has not been previously characterised. We rationalised that,
if nucleosides are recovered in un-phosphorylated forms (through import) or monophosphate
forms (through intracellular hydrolysis), the barrier restricting their incorporation into the
DNA may lie in the nucleotide salvage enzymes or DNA polymerases. Providing cells with a
final substrate for DNA polymerases, in the form of deoxynucleoside triphosphate, would
allow decoupling of DNA synthesis from salvage enzyme activity. Therefore, we transfected
two human cancer cell lines - MDA-MB-231 and H1299 with 5hydroxymethyl-2′deoxycytidine triphosphate (5hmdCTP), isolated DNA and analysed base
composition by HPLC-UV, which was calibrated with a set of nucleoside standards (Fig.
1a). After 5hmdCTP transfection, two additional nucleosides were observed in the
hydrolysed DNA that correspond to 5hmdC and 5hmdU (Fig. 1b, c, Extended Data Fig. 1b).
This indicates that DNA polymerases can incorporate 5hmdC into DNA and also
demonstrates strong deaminase activity acting on either the nucleotide or on the incorporated
base, resulting in the presence of 5hmUra in the DNA. The capacity for DNA polymerases
to use 5hmdCTP was also evident in an in vitro replication assay13 (Fig. 1d), demonstrating
that human DNA polymerases are not selective against the incorporation of 5hmdC into
DNA. Therefore, if salvage pathways can convert pre-existing sources of 5hmdC into their
nucleotide triphosphate forms, this could result in their incorporation into cellular DNA and
potentially lead to deleterious effects on the epigenome.
The final triphosphate form of cytidine in a cell is produced by sequential phosphorylation
by three classes of cytidine kinases. First, deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) produces a
monophosphate, which is then converted into a diphosphate by cytidine monophosphate
kinases (CMPK1, CMPK2), and subsequently into a triphosphate by the family of
nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs)14. Since NDPKs phosphorylate both purine and
pyrimidine nucleosides15, and CMPK2 is found in the mitochondria16, we directed our
efforts on examining the substrate selectivity of DCK and CMPK1. Recombinant DCK was
able to transfer the phosphate from ATP[γ-32P] to 5mdC, 5hmdC and 5fdC, but not 5cadC
(Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1d), while CMPK1 phosphorylated only unmodified cytidine
monophosphate (Fig. 1e). In agreement with previous work on 5mdC4, we can conclude that
the inability of CMPK1 to create diphosphates of modified nucleotides provides the main
barrier to the formation of respective dCTPs, limiting their availability for DNA
polymerases, which can instead accept modified dCTPs.
Given this inherent selectivity of the nucleotide salvage pathway kinase CMPK1 for
unmodified cytidine, we hypothesized that the introduction of abundant biologically
modified cytidine variants would have little adverse effect on the physiology of a cell, unless

they significantly impaired nucleotide metabolism. First, we determined that biological
cytidine variants retain 70-100% of their original form after incubation in water and cell
culture media for 10 days at 37°C, while 80% of the synthetic variant 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine
(5azadC) decomposed by day 2 in agreement with previous observations17 (Extended Data
Fig. 2a,b,c). Next, a panel of 19 human cell lines was selected, sampling various tissue
origins and p53 mutation statuses (Extended Data Fig. 2d)18. When cell growth media was
supplemented with 10 μM 5hmdC or dC, the majority of the cell lines continued to
proliferate at a normal rate. However, two cell lines (HOP-92 and MDA-MB-231)
unexpectedly ceased to proliferate in presence of 5hmdC (Fig. 2a). 10 μM 5hmdC was lethal
and 1 μM 5hmdC caused mild growth inhibition (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, 5fdC was more
potent at 1 and 10 μM doses in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, but displayed the same cell line
selectivity as 5hmdC (Fig. 2b).

Genetic alterations or gene expression differences could modify the response of a cell line to
biologically modified cytidine variants. By comparing the existing gene expression profiles
of the cell lines (NCI60 and CCLE projects19,20) that we established as sensitive to modified
cytidine variants to two randomly chosen resistant ones, we identified 1380 differentially
expressed genes (p<0.01, >2-fold change). Interestingly, by focussing on differentially
expressed genes known to be in involved in nucleoside metabolism, we identified cytidine
deaminase (CDA) overexpression in the 5hmdC sensitive cell types, which had the 9th
lowest p value of all the genes (Fig. 2c, Extended Table 1). Importantly, none of the other
known genes involved, either in nucleoside transport or cytidine recycling, were
differentially expressed (Fig. 2c). To identify other cell lines with CDA overexpression, we
ranked the 21 available cell lines according to their CDA mRNA levels (Fig. 2d). SN12C
and Capan-2 cell lines had the highest CDA expression, which was confirmed at the protein
level by Western blot (Fig. 2e). Examination of 5hmdC and 5fdC tolerance revealed that a 10
μM dose substantially inhibited the growth of both cell lines, suggesting that the expression
level of CDA is predictive of cytotoxicity for these epigenetic cytidine variants (Fig. 2e).
To determine whether CDA overexpression is necessary for selective cytotoxicity, we
manipulated CDA levels in the identified cell lines. Cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SN12C)
with stable shRNA knock-down of CDA were able to survive 10 μM 5hmdC (Fig. 3a,
Extended Data Fig. 2e). Furthermore, stable overexpression of CDA in normally 5hmdCresistant cell lines (H1299 and MCF-7) induced substantial growth inhibition (Fig. 3b,
Extended Data Fig. 2f). These experiments clearly established that CDA overexpression is
predictive, necessary and sufficient for cytotoxic activity. In vitro measurements of
recombinant CDA protein activity were performed with various cytidine variants. First, we
determined that CDA deaminates 5mdC, 5hmdC and 5fdC, but not 5cadC, creating
thymidine and respective variants of uridine (Extended Data Fig. 2g, h). Second, reaction
kinetic data fitted well with a pseudo zero-order kinetics model (R2>0.9) revealing that, after
dC, the second best substrate (i.e. second highest kcat) for CDA is 5fdC (Fig. 3c, d, Extended
Data Fig. 2h). This was unexpected, because the catalytic activity does not follow a simple
relationship with the dimensions of the 5′ modification as it does in the case of AID and
APOBEC enzymes21. Molecular docking of cytidine variants to the CDA structure22
suggested that 5fdC docks to the catalytic site with nearly 180° rotation when compared to
unmodified cytidine, retaining the amino group position close to the active site containing

Zn2+ (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Contrary, 5hmdC docks in the active site by displacing the
amino group, which provides a potential explanation for the lower catalytic turnover
observed (Extended Data Fig. 3a).

The deamination of dC and 5mdC results in dU and T, which are the normal precursors for
thymidine triphosphate (TTP) synthesis. Conversely, deamination of 5hmdC and 5fdC
produces 5hmdU and 5fdU, respectively, which are not canonical nucleosides. When
phosphorylated and incorporated into DNA, 5hmdU and 5fdU are toxic to the cells
(Extended Data Fig. 3b) as they are recognized as damaged bases and trigger extensive
uracil glycosylase activity resulting in DNA breaks23. Therefore, we asked whether the
uptake of 5hmdC in CDA overexpressing cells leads to its conversion into 5hmdU and to its
incorporation into DNA, potentially explaining cell type specific lethality. First, we
determined activities of thymidine kinase (TK) and thymidylate kinase (DTYMK) on
5hmdU and 5fdU. In contrast to the inability of CMPK1 to act on equivalent cytidine
variants, TK and DTYMK phosphorylated both uridine variants (Fig. 3e). Notably, the
corresponding triphosphates are not substrates nor potent inhibitors of dUTPase, a robust
enzyme that removes dUTP from cells (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Finally, analysis of the
genomic DNA composition of 5hmdC and 5fdC treated MDA-MB-231 cells identified
5hmUra and 5fUra, but no detectable change in 5hmCyt or 5fdCyt levels in the DNA (Fig.
3f, Extended Data Fig. 3d, e and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b, c). Overall, in all the cell lines
examined, a linear correlation was observed between CDA expression and the amount of
5hmdU in the DNA after treatment with 5hmdC (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Signs of extensive
DNA damage were detected by phosphoH2AX staining in 5hmdC-treated CDA
overexpressing cells (MDA-MB-231). In contrast, a cell line expressing low level of CDA
(H1299) had no obvious phospho-H2AX (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). Also,
increased numbers of cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle were observed in CDA
overexpressing cell lines, consistent with cell cycle arrest triggered by a DNA damage
response (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We did not observe deviations in the dNTP pools of
treated cells, indicating that the cell death is likely to be caused by extensive base excision
by SMUG1 DNA glycosylase, which recognises 5hmUra and 5fUra triggering repair and
DNA double stranded breaks (Extended Data Fig. 6). Together, these observations
demonstrate that CDA deaminates 5hmdC and 5fdC creating 5hmdU and 5fdU
(respectively), which are incorporated into the DNA, leading to cell cycle arrest and
eventually death.
CDA overexpression has been linked to resistance to cytidine analogues – such as
gemcitabine, cytosine arabinoside or 5-azacytidine – that are currently used in cancer
treatment, presenting a major obstacle to their use11,24-26. Our observations regarding
biological nucleoside variants demonstrate an opposite effect: CDA overexpression
sensitises cells to otherwise non-toxic 5hmdC and 5fdC. Since cancers originating in the
pancreas27, stomach, testis and vagina have up-regulated CDA expression28 (Extended Data
Fig. 7a, b), we postulated that administration of 5hmdC and 5fdC could have a selective
activity against these tumour cells. We first tested whether cytotoxic activity is cell
autonomous for CDA overexpressing H1299 cells in the presence of wild type (wt, CDA
low) H1299 cells. Both 5hmdC and 5fdC were able to selectively eliminate CDA
overexpressing cells, suggesting that secreted CDA or 5hmdU is insufficient for cytotoxicity

(Fig. 4a). Tolerance to and stability of 5hmdC and 5fdC in vivo was determined in
immunocompromised BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu/nu mice after they received a range of doses
(12.5 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg) of 5hmdC and 5fdC by intraperitoneal injection. Half an hour
after injection, we were able to detect 5hmdC and 5fdC in the bloodstream, and to quantify
5hmdC using RapidFire MS (Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). We observed no adverse effects on
behaviour, injection site, weight or histology in the panel of tissues studied, even though
some tissues (kidney and intestine) express CDA (Extended Data Fig. 7e, f, g, h, data not
shown). To determine whether cytidine variants have an effect on tumour growth in
proliferating cells, we subcutaneously injected H1299 wt and CDA overexpressing cells into
each side of an animal, which was later treated with 5hmdC or 5fdC (Fig. 4b). Xenografts
with CDA overexpression grew slightly slower (reaching 64% of wt tumour volume), and
the volume of the tumour was further reduced 2-fold in animals treated with 5hmdC or 5fdC
(Fig. 4c). CDA-overexpressing tumours showed a 2-fold decrease in the number of
proliferating cells and a 3-fold increase in the number of cells with DNA damage in 5fdCinjected animals, but smaller differences in animals that were 5hmdC-injected (Fig. 4d).
Similar CDA-dependent effects on tumour volume and proliferation were observed when
SN12C wt and SN12C CDA knock-down cells were used in the xenograft assay (Extended
Data Fig. 8).

Here, we have characterised the metabolism of newly discovered biologically modified
nucleosides, leading to a model in which the selectivity of CMPK1 prevents random
incorporation of modified cytosines (Fig. 4e). Interestingly, we have discovered that 5hmdC
and 5fdC, but not 5cadC, are deaminated by CDA at different rates, resulting in the cytotoxic
5hmdU and 5fdU. Our data on oxidised epigenetic bases is similar to the proposed
mechanism of 5mdC salvage, in which CMPK1 is rate limiting in the production of the
diphosphate, whereas 5mdC deamination produces a normal T4-6. We did not observe any
adverse effects during the administration of 5hmdC and 5fdC in mice, presumably because
the cytotoxic threshold is only reached in highly proliferating and CDA overexpressing cells,
in which there is substantial incorporation of nucleoside variants in the DNA, reflected by
the CDA-dependent regression of xenografts. Together with recent publications
demonstrating the importance of and therapeutic opportunities targeting MTH1, which
surveys damaged nucleosides29,30, our data extend the current understanding of the
metabolism of biological cytidine variants and provide a novel avenue for cancer therapy.

columns, supplemented with final 10 mM DTT and 40% of glycerol, snap frozen and stored
in aliquots at −80°C. Human CMPK1 was tagged at the C-terminus with 6xHis and purified
using a similar workflow to DCK with the following exceptions: the lysis buffer was 50 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche); after the gel
filtration step the protein was bound to an anion exchange column HiTrap Q HP 5 ml (GE

following HiTRAP purification, 6xHis tag was cleaved by thrombin (Sigma); cleaved tag
and un-cleaved protein was removed by separation using a HiTRAP HP 5 ml column and
collection of the flow-through. Subsequently, the protein was purified using gel filtration as
indicated above and stored in aliquots at −80°C. Protein purity was assessed by
electrophoresis and CDA was additionally identified by MS. Human TMPK1 with a Cterminal 6xHis tag was cloned in pET28a(+) and expressed in E. coli BL21 RIPL (Life

Avestin) at 15000 psi equipped with a recirculating cooler (F250, Julabo) set at 4°C. The
protein was bound to a Hi-TRAP HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear
gradient of 0-500 mM imidazole in the lysis buffer, supplemented with 10% glycerol. The
fractions were assessed by electrophoresis and ones containing the protein were pooled,

following the conditions described in 32 with 1 μg DCK, 1 μg CMPK1 and 1 mM substrate.
TK (8180-TK-050, R&D Systems) and TMPK1 were assayed through a coupled assay with

MDA_MB_231 and H1299 treated with 10 μM dC, 10 μM 5hmdC and 1 μM 5fdC.
Metabolites were extracted at day three as described before41. Briefly, cells were washed in
PBS and scraped on ice. The pellet was washed again in cold PBS and extraction was done
with 50 μl of ice cold 50% ACN per mg of pellet. The samples were vortexed and incubated
on ice for 10 min. Insoluble material was pelleted at 20000 g for 10 min and supernatants
were dried using a SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific). Metabolites were dissolved in 30 μl of
buffer A and 20 μl was used for chromatography. HPLC was performed as described41 with
some minor modifications as listed below. Nucleotides were resolved with an Agilent
UHPLC 1290 instrument fitted with Eclipse Plus C18 RRHD 1.8 μm, 2.1×150 mm column
and detected with Agilent 1290 DAD fitted with a Max-Light 60 mm cell at 254, 260 and
280 nm. Buffer A consisted of 100 mM KH2PO4 (60221, Sigma) with 8 mM
tetrabutylammoniumbisulfate (98479, Sigma) set at pH 5.5. Buffer B consisted of Buffer A
with 25 % MeOH. After 8 min at 0% buffer B, the gradient started with a linear increase of
buffer B to 35% in 19 min, followed by a linear increase from 35% to 38% buffer B in 5 min
and from 38% to 100% buffer B in 22 min. After an 8 min hold at 100% Buffer B, the
gradient was reversed from 100% to 0% buffer B in 2 min, followed by a hold at 0% buffer
B for 2 min. The column temperature was set at 30°C and the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. The
compounds were identified by comparing their retention times and their UV spectra with

Cell culture and transfections

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using Lonza Mycoalert Kit.
Cell proliferation assays were done by seeding cells in p60 plates or in a T25 flask with
appropriate concentrations of 5hmdC, 5fdC or dC in the growth media. The cells were
passaged, counted and the media was replaced every two days. Before counting, 1 volume of
Trypan blue solution (Lonza) was added to an aliquot of single cell suspension. The live
cells were counted by TC-20 Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). NTPs were introduced by
nucleofection. 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were nucleofected with 50 mM 5hmdC in a 100 μl
volume using an Amaxa nucleofector kit (Lonza), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
After transfection, cells were seeded in a 6 well plate, 24 h later washed twice with PBS, and
48 h later DNA extracted for HPLC analysis.
Production of stable cell lines
Stable cell lines were generated via lentiviral infection using a standard protocol42 with 2nd
generation packaging plasmids (pCMV-VSVG, pCMV-dR8.9, a generous gift from Bruno
Amati, IIT, Milan). CDA knock-down was achieved by infecting MDA-MB-231 and SN12C
cell lines with pLKO.1 vectors containing 5 different shRNA constructs (SHCLNDNM_001785, Sigma-Aldrich) and a control pLKO.1 containing shRNA silencing Luciferase
(a gift from Xin Lu, Oxford Ludwig Cancer Research). Infected cells were selected by
incubation with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 60 hrs. Two cell lines with the lowest
CDA mRNA (shRNA TRCN0000051290 and TRCN0000051288) levels were further
assessed by immunoblotting and used for experiments. Lentivirus for CDA overexpression
was generated with pLenti-puro (39481, Addgene, Ie-Ming Shih laboratory) expressing
dsRed-IRES-CDA. H1299 and MCF-7 were infected as above. Infected cells were selected
with puromycin at 2 μg/ml for 60 hrs.

Immunoblotting, FACS and immunofluorescence
For Western blot analysis, 106 cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5,
300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche)) and sonicated. Cleared lysates were
electrophoresed and immunoblotted with the following primary antibodies: α-CDA (Sigma,
SAB1300717 1:250), α-actin (Abcam, ab185058 1:75000). Chemiluminescent detection,
after incubation of the membranes with appropriate secondary antibodies, was done through
a CCD camera using the ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad) with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad,
version 4.0). For FACS analysis, 5×105 cells were trypsinised, washed in PBS and fixed in
70% ethanol for 1 h on ice. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 250 μl of staining
solution (50 μg/ml Propidium Iodide (P4864, Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml RNaseA and 0.05%
Triton×100) and incubated at 37°C for 40 min. Controls were used for G1 (serum starvation
overnight) and G2 (0.1μg/μl nocodazole overnight). Fluorescence of 10,000 cells was
recorded with a FACS Canto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo
software (Version 7.6.5, TreeStar). For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed
twice in PBS and permeabilised for 10 minutes in 0.2% TritonX-100. After 2 washes in
PBS, cells were blocked for 1 h in 3% BSA (Sigma Aldrich), dissolved in PBS and

incubated with γH2A.X antibody (Millipore, 05-636, 1:500) overnight at 4°C in a
humidified chamber. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with anti-mouse
secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa546 (1:400, Life Technologies) and DAPI (Sigma
Aldrich). Coverslips were then washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with mounting media
(Vectashield). Tiled pictures were automatically taken with a Zeiss 710 microscope with a
20× lens. The amount of nuclear fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ.
Gene expression analysis and public datasets
Datasets used in the study: GSE36139 (GPL15308)43, GSE32474 (GPL570)44. Gene
expression analysis comparing was done on the data from the NCI-60 panel45 as follows.
Affy HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray data was downloaded from CellMiner database (http://
discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/loadDownload.do) and cel files were extracted for triplicate
experiments done on BR:MCF7, ME:MDA_MB_435, BR:MDA_MB_231 and LC:HOP_92
cell lines. Data was then imported into ArrayStar v11 (DNAStar) and signal normalisation
and intensity correction was done using RMA Quantile method. Experiment was designed
by grouping BR:MCF7, ME:MDA_MB_435 cell lines into “Resistant” group and
BR:MDA_MB_231 and LC:HOP_92 cell lines into “Sensitive” group. Differential
expression between the groups was determined using the Student’s t-test with Benjamini
Hochberg multiple testing correction. Genes were called as differentially expressed when
p<0.01 and fold change >2. The full dataset is included in Extended Table 1. To derive CDA
expression values in tumours, GPL1530843 and GPL57044 were analysed directly on the
NCBI portal with GEO2R. p-values were adjusted with Benjamini Hochberg correction.
Toxicology and dose determination in animal experiments

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Animal work was done after approval by the UK Home Office and University of Oxford
Local Ethical review. Three 5-7 week old BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu/nu (Harlan) mice per
dose were injected (IP) with 25, 50, 100 mg/kg of 5hmdC and 12.5, 25, 50, 100 mg/kg of
5fdC. Animals were monitored for any deviations from normal behaviour. At 30 minutes
post injection, a few drops of blood were collected through tail vein bleeding using
Microvette CB300 (Sarstedt) to assess the amounts of the compounds in the bloodstream.
Mass spectrometry analysis of serum samples
Serum was isolated by centrifugation of Microvettes according to the recommendations of
the manufacturer (Sarstedt). The samples were brought up to 200 μl with water and 3
volumes of methanol, and 150 μl of chloroform added. After intense vortexing, 450 μl of
water was added, samples were vortexed again and centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 1 min. The
aqueous phase containing the soluble molecules was collected and dried in a Speedvac
(Thermo Scientific). The dried pellets were then resuspended in 10 μl water, then 3 μl
diluted further into 50 μl of water to load on a RapidFire 360 high throughput sample
delivery system. The samples were aspirated by vacuum at −40 bar for 400 ms into a 10 μl
sample loop and loaded onto a graphitised carbon SPE cartridge running buffer 5 mM
ammonium formate at a flow of 1.5 ml/min. The matrix components not retained on the
cartridge were diverted to waste for 4500 ms, followed by elution of the retained
components with 95% acetonitrile 5mM ammonium formate for 4500 ms at a flow of 1 ml/
min, then analysed using an Agilent 6530 QTof mass spectrometer. The SPE was then reNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 13.

equilibrated for 4500 ms with 5 mM ammonium formate. Data was collected in positive ion
mode using a 2 Gb data collection, Gas temperature 300°C, Drying gas 8 l/min, Nebuliser
gas 35 psig, Vcap 3500 V, fragmentor voltage 175 V. The amount of nucleoside was
measured against a standard curve produced by dissolving known amounts of 5hmdC and
5fdC in foetal bovine serum and processed as indicated above. Data was analysed using an
Agilent Mass Hunter Qualitative B.06 and Quantitative analysis B.05. Standard curve
analysis was determined by using a quadratic curve fit algorithm for each nucleoside with an
R2 >0.98 in all instances.
Nucleoside analysis by mass spectrometry (HPLC-QToF)
Samples were dried in a speed-vac and re-suspended in 10 μl of water. For the analysis by
HPLC-QToF, a 1290 Infinity UHPLC was fitted with a BEH C18 XP Column, (130Å, 1.7
μm, 2.1 mm X 150 mm; Waters) and coupled to a 6560 Ion mobility Q-TOF LC/MS mass
spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with an Jetstream ESI-AJS source. The
data were acquired in QToF only mode using positive electrospray ionisation (ESI+). Two
reference ions, m/z 121.0508 and 922.0097 were used as internal standards. The Dual AJS
ESI settings were as follows: gas temperature: 150°C, The drying gas: 5 l/min, nebulizer 35
psig, sheath gas temperature 360°C, sheath gas flow 12 l/min, VCap: 4000 V and nozzle
voltage: 300 V. The fragmentor of the MS TOF was set to 275 V.
The gradient used to elute the nucleosides started by a 1 minute isocratic gradient composed
with 99.5 % Buffer A (10 mM ammonium acetate pH 6) and 0.5 % buffer B (composed of
40 % CH3CN) with a flow rate of 0.350 ml/min and was followed by the subsequent steps::
1-2 min, 98.2 % A; 2-16 min 80 % A; 16-18 min 50 % A; 18 -20 min 25 % A; 20.20-21.5
min 0 % A; 21.5-22.5 min 100% B; 22.5-24.5 min 99.5 % B. The gradient was followed by
a 5 min post time to re-equilibrate the column.

The raw MS data was analysed using the MassHunter Qual Software package (Agilent
Technologies, version B7.0), and the masses / retention times used for the characterization of
nucleosides and their adducts are summarized in Extended table 2. For the identification of
compounds, raw MS data was processed using the molecular feature extraction function in
the MassHunter software, followed by metabolite searching through mass / isotope matching
using the PCDL software (version B.07.00 build 7024.0) and the METLIN database (https://
metlin.scripps.edu/index.php). For each nucleoside, precursor ions corresponding to the M
+H, M+Na, M+K, 2M and base only species were extracted, and the most intense ion
species observed for each nucleoside was used for quantitation. Identities of peaks eluting at
4.5 and 5.1 min (Fig. 1b and 3f) are shown in the Extended Data Fig. 9 and 10.
Subcutaneus xenografts
Animal work was done after approval by the UK Home Office and University of Oxford
Local Ethical review. 106 cells in a 50% suspension of MatriGel (200 μl) were injected into
5-7 week old BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu/nu (Harlan) mice, 8 animals per group in each flank
following the scheme: SN12C/H1299 left, SN12C shCDA8/H1299 dsRedCDA right. When
the tumours reached palpable size, 8 mice were assigned to each treatment group: PBS, 100
mg/kg of 5hmdC and 100 mg/kg 5fdC. The compounds were administered every 72 h (4

doses in total). Tumour size was measured every 3 days by Vernier caliper and the animal
cohort sacrificed when the cumulative tumour diameter in the first animal reached 12 mm.
Tumour volume was calculated assuming that the tumours were spheres with the following
formula: 4/3 π (D/2)3, in which D represents the diameter of the tumour.

Histology
Organs and tumours were collected and immediately 10% formalin fixed for 48 h. They
were then embedded in wax and 4 μm thick sections cut. All sections were stained with
H&E. Tumours were additionally stained with a Masson’s Trichrome Stain Kit (Sigma
Aldrich) according to the manufacturer instructions.
Immunofluorescence of tissues and tumours
4 μm thick sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with a pressure cooker in Tris buffer
pH 9 (10mM Tris base, 0.05% Tween 20). They were then blocked in 3% BSA in PBS for
30 minutes and incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C with the following
antibodies: γH2A.X (Millipore, 05-636, 1:200) and PH3 (Millipore, 06-570, 1:200) or βcatenin (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610153, 1:250) and CDA (Sigma Aldrich,
SAB1300717, 1:100). The slides were then washed vigorously 3 times in PBS and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature with an appropriate secondary antibody, Alexa546 and
Alexa488 conjugated (1:400, Life Technologies) and DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). Coverslips
were then washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with mounting media (Vectashield). Images
were acquired with a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope with a 20× objective. For quantification
of DNA damage and proliferation in tumours, tiled images with Z stacks were acquired to
cover the entire central section of the tumour. Image J was used to quantify the
immunofluorescence signal.
