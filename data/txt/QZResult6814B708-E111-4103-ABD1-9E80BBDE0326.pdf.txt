Abstract
Pan- or multidrug resistance is a central problem in clinical
oncology. Here, we use a genetically engineered mouse model of
BRCA2-associated hereditary breast cancer to study drug resistance to several types of chemotherapy and PARP inhibition. We
found that multidrug resistance was strongly associated with an
EMT-like sarcomatoid phenotype and high expression of the

Abcb1b gene, which encodes the drug efﬂux transporter P-glycoprotein. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein could partly resensitize
sarcomatoid tumors to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, docetaxel,
and doxorubicin. We propose that multidrug resistance is a
multifactorial process and that mouse models are useful to
unravel this. Cancer Res; 75(4); 732–41. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

cell lines that acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
and targeted inhibitors (4), and induction of EMT by recombinant TGFb treatment led to resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors and cisplatin (5), suggesting a role of EMT in
pan-resistance.
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which comprises
various histologic and molecular subtypes. Among these is the
subgroup of metaplastic breast cancer, a variant of triple-negative
breast cancer, which includes several morphologic entities,
including spindle-shaped tumor cells (6, 7). A molecular subtype
that is frequently observed in metaplastic cancers is the claudinlow signature (8, 9). Because metaplastic cancers have a poor
prognosis, we wondered whether EMT might contribute to poor
drug response of these tumors.
To study the inﬂuence of EMT on pan-resistance, we made use
of a unique mouse model of BRCA2-deﬁcient breast cancer, that
is, the K14cre;Brca2F/F;p53F/F mammary tumor model (10).
Female K14cre;Brca2F/F;p53F/F mice develop mostly epithelial
mammary carcinomas, but also mesenchymal carcinosarcomas
are formed. Because the K14 promoter drives Cre expression only
in epithelial cells (10), it is plausible that these mesenchymal
mammary tumors originate from an EMT. The advantage of such
an in vivo model is that no cell lines have to be used, which may
poorly represent the original tumor (11). We and others have
previously shown that the BRCA2-deﬁcient mouse mammary
tumors are sensitive to DNA damage–inducing drugs and PARP
inhibitors due to the lack of error-free repair of double-strand
DNA breaks by homologous recombination (12–16). In patients
with BRCA2-deﬁcient breast cancer, such an increased sensitivity
was also observed after neoadjuvant therapy with DNA-damaging
agents (17, 18) or PARP inhibitors (19). We investigated whether
this drug sensitivity is diminished in BRCA2-deﬁcient carcinosarcomas. For this purpose, we compared the responses of epithelial
carcinomas and mesenchymal carcinosarcomas with chemotherapy drugs and PARP inhibitors. We found that BRCA2-deﬁcient
carcinosarcomas are multidrug resistant, which was, at least in
part, due to high expression of the drug efﬂux transporters
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP),
which transport a wide range of chemotherapeutic and targeted
agents. In addition, we found that an EMT-like gene-expression

A major clinical problem in cancer therapy is resistance of
tumors to all available therapies, a phenomenon called panresistance (1). After an initial response primary tumors and
especially metastases do not respond anymore to treatment,
including radiotherapy. The frequently used term "multidrug
resistance" historically refers to resistance due to drug efﬂux
transporters, but upregulation of these transporters cannot
fully explain pan-resistance. Drug resistance is not only a
problem for classical chemotherapeutics, but also for targeted
therapeutics. Mechanisms can be drug-speciﬁc, such as imatinib resistance caused by mutations in or overexpression of the
drug target BCR–ABL (2), or downregulation of Top1 or Top2
causing resistance to topoisomerase I or II poisons (3). The
precise mechanisms that cause resistance of tumors to multiple
classes of drugs are not fully understood. One mechanism that
has been put forward to explain pan-resistance of various types
of cancer is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT;
refs. 1, 4). During EMT cells lose epithelial characteristics and
acquire mesenchymal characteristics. EMT is a physiologic
process involved in, for example, embryogenesis and wound
healing, but it has also been described for epithelial cancers
when cells acquire a spindle-shaped (also called "mesenchymal" or "sarcomatoid") morphology and lose expression of
cell adhesion molecules. In vitro, EMT was observed in various

Multidrug Resistance of Sarcomatoid Mouse Mammary Tumors

proﬁle correlates with Pgp expression in multiple independent
mouse mammary tumor datasets.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor transplantations
Tumors were generated in K14cre;Brca2F/F;p53F/F (KB2P) female
mice (10) and samples were taken for histology, RNA isolation
and cryopreservation. Orthotopic transplantation of Brca2D/D;
p53D/D, p53D/D, and p53D/D;Abcb1a/b/ tumors in wild-type
FVB/Ola129 F1 mice was performed as previously described
(20). The tumor size was monitored at least three times a week
by calliper measurements. The tumor volume was calculated with
the following formula: 0.5  length  width2. Animals were
sacriﬁced with CO2, when the tumor reached a size of 1,500 mm3.
Cre-mediated deletion of exon 11 in Brca2 and exons 2–10 in
Trp53 was conﬁrmed by genotyping PCR and Southern blotting as
described previously (14, 21). All animal experiments were
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Netherlands
Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, the Netherlands).
Drug treatments
Upon tumor outgrowth to approximately 200 mm3 (100%)
the mice were either left untreated or received one of the following
treatments: olaparib (50 mg/kg i.p., daily for 28 days), topotecan
(4 mg/kg i.p., days 0–4 and days 14–18), doxorubicin (Amersham
Pharmacia Netherlands; 5 mg/kg i.v., days 0, 7, and 14), docetaxel
(Aventis; 25 mg/kg i.v., days 0, 7, and 14) or cisplatin (Mayne
Pharma; 6 mg/kg i.v., day 0). Mice with a relapsing tumor received
another treatment cycle when the tumor was 100% of the original
size at treatment start. For the resensitization experiment with
tariquidar (Fig. 4B), the mice received only one treatment cycle
and tumor outgrowth was monitored. Tariquidar (Avaant; 10
mg/kg i.p.) was administered 15 minutes before treatment with
olaparib, docetaxel, or doxorubicin. AZD2461 (100 mg/kg orally;
ref. 22) was administered daily for 28 days.
Immunohistochemistry and ﬂuorescence
Staining of E-cadherin and vimentin was performed on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Samples were boiled
in Tris-EDTA pH9.0 to retrieve the antigens. Furthermore, we used
3% H2O2 in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity,
and 10% milk (E-cadherin) or 4% BSA plus 5% normal goat
serum in PBS (vimentin) as blocking buffer. Primary antibodies
(mouse anti–E-cadherin, BD Transduction Laboratories 610182,
1:400; rabbit anti-vimentin, Cell Signaling Technology 5741,
1:200) were diluted in 1.25% normal goat serum plus 1% BSA
in PBS. For detection and visualization labeled polymer-HRP
(horseradish peroxidase) anti-mouse and rabbit Envision (Dako
K4007 and K4011), DAB (Sigma D5905), and hematoxylin
counterstaining were applied.
CD31 staining was done on cryosections after acetone ﬁxation
for 10 minutes at 20 C. Then we applied 0.3% H2O2 in methanol, avidin–biotin block (Dako X0590) and serum-free protein
block (Dako X0909). The primary (rat anti-CD31, BD Biosciences
550274; 1:1,000) and secondary antibodies (biotinylated rabbitanti–rat IgG, Dako E0468, 1:300) were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS.
For detection and visualization, we used streptavidin–HRP (Dako
K1016, 10 minutes incubation at room temperature), DAB (Dako
K3468), and hematoxylin counterstaining.

www.aacrjournals.org

For visualization of perfused blood vessels, biotinylated Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (B1175 Vector Laboratories) was added to streptavidin-AF633 (S21375 Invitrogen) in
sterile PBS and injected in the tail vein 15 minutes before sacriﬁcing the mouse. For visualization of the Lectin-AF633 signal, FFPE
slides were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, incubated with DAPI for 5
minutes, and mounted in Vectashield (H-1000 Vector Laboratories). Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 (Leica Microsystems) confocal system, equipped with a 405-nm Diode laser and
633-nm HeNe laser system.
Gene-expression proﬁling
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) from snapfrozen tumor samples. The RNA was processed according to the
manufacturer's instructions for single channel 45K MouseWG-6
v2.0 BeadChips (Illumina). Background correction was performed using the bg.adjust method from the Bioconductor affy
package (23). For normalization between arrays, the robust spline
method was applied.
EMT signature and EMT score
A published EMT signature (5) was converted from human to
mouse, resulting in 239 epithelial genes (down after EMT) and
224 mesenchymal genes (up after EMT). Of these, 235 epithelial
and 223 mesenchymal genes could be mapped to Ensembl gene
identiﬁers using Ensembl Biomart (24).
Generation of gene-expression data from p53D/D and Cdh1D/D;
p53D/D mouse mammary tumors has been described (Klijn and
colleagues; submitted for publication). Gene-expression datasets
GSE3165 (25), GSE23938 (26), and GSE10885 (27) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus.
Expression data were mean-centered per gene or probe for each
dataset. The EMT score of each tumor in all datasets is calculated
by subtracting the mean log2 expression of the epithelial genes
from the mean of the log2 expression of the mesenchymal genes.
Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the number of signature
genes represented on each platform. As a result, tumors with a
mesenchymal gene-expression proﬁle have a positive score and
tumors with an epithelial proﬁle have a negative EMT score. For
the correlation between EMT score and Abcb1a, Abcb1b, and Abcg2
expressions, we used the Spearman correlation and signiﬁcance
was tested with the t distribution test.
Array comparative genomic hybridization
Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data from
Brca2D/D;p53D/D mouse mammary tumors were downloaded from
Array Express (E-NCMF-34 and E-NCMF-35). The phenotype was
determined previously (28), with one exception: a tumor with
unknown phenotype was later classiﬁed as carcinosarcoma. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using the Euclidean distance method with complete linkage.
RT-MLPA
Semiquantitative levels of Abcb1a, Abcb1b, and Abcg2 mRNA
were measured with reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation–
dependent probe ampliﬁcation (RT-MLPA). Reverse transcription
of total RNA, hybridization, ligation, PCR ampliﬁcation, and
fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis were performed as
described previously (29). Gene-expression levels were normalized to the internal reference Actb (b-actin).

Results
Two main mammary tumor phenotypes are produced in
K14cre;Brca2F/F;p53F/F mice
To study the effect of a mesenchymal morphology on therapy
response, we made use of the K14cre;Brca2F/F;p53F/F mouse model
(10). K14cre-mediated deletion of exon 11 of Brca2 and exon
2–10 of Trp53 in mammary epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1) results in the development of mammary tumors with an
average latency of 181 days. We used an established orthotopic
transplantation model to study the response of each donor tumor
to various chemotherapies (30). As described previously (10), the
predominant histopathologic mammary tumor phenotype in
K14cre;Brca2F/F;p53F/F mice is a carcinoma with well-deﬁned
tumor cell nests. These tumors express epithelial markers such
as E-cadherin and are negative for vimentin, a ﬁbroblast and

present in the group of 14 Brca2D/D;p53D/D (KB2P) mammary
tumors used in this study, is a sarcomatoid tumor that has
undergone a spindle cell metaplasia, characterized by bundles
with elongated cells, absence of E-cadherin and expression of
vimentin (Fig. 1A, bottom). This subtype is referred to as carcinosarcoma. In our tumor panel, we identiﬁed 10 carcinomas and
four carcinosarcomas. In contrast with the clear histopathologic
separation, the carcinosarcomas did not form a separate group at
the genomic level when we tested aCGH data of a larger panel of
Brca2D/D;p53D/D carcinomas and carcinosarcomas (28) by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus,
these tumors do not form a clearly separate subgroup within this
model for BRCA2-mutated breast cancer at the DNA level.
Because of the spindle-shaped morphology of the carcinosarcomas, we suspected that these tumors have undergone EMT after

panel of BRCA2;p53–deﬁcient mouse mammary tumors. This
signature has previously been shown to be associated with genes
that are upregulated in geﬁtinib-resistant non–small cell lung
cancers (5). In addition, the EMT index based on a subset of this
signature, correlates with colorectal cancer subtypes (31). As

even though they eventually acquired resistance to olaparib,
topotecan, docetaxel, and doxorubicin. In contrast, the four
carcinosarcomas did not respond well to olaparib, topotecan,
docetaxel, and doxorubicin, but were still sensitive to cisplatin.
In Fig. 1B the response to each drug is depicted per tumor and
shows that a poor response is highly correlated with a mesenchymal gene-expression proﬁle. Carcinomas that acquired drug
resistance have all retained their epithelial state, as measured by
histology and gene expression (see Supplementary Fig. S3, for the
olaparib-resistant tumors).
Drug delivery is not impaired in Brca2D/D;p53D/D
carcinosarcomas
In a mouse model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the
lack of response to gemcitabine was caused by a poor perfusion of
the tumors (32). We therefore checked the presence of blood
vessels in KB2P carcinomas and carcinosarcomas. Both subtypes
showed blood vessels throughout the tumor (Fig. 3A). In the
carcinomas, blood vessels are mainly present between the cell
nests, whereas in carcinosarcomas blood vessels lay in between
the tumor cells. The vessels are functional, as shown by the
presence of i.v. injected, ﬂuorescently labeled Tomato-Lectin (Fig.
3B), indicating that the drugs reach the tumor cells in both KB2P
subtypes. These data are consistent with our observation that both
carcinomas and carcinosarcomas respond to cisplatin.
Brca2D/D;p53D/D carcinosarcomas can be resensitized to
chemotherapy by coadministration of the Pgp inhibitor
tariquidar
Each drug for which we observed primary resistance in the
carcinosarcomas, is known to be transported by drug efﬂux
transporters: olaparib (30), docetaxel (33), and doxorubicin
(34) by ABCB1 (also known as Pgp) and topotecan mainly by
ABCG2 (also known as BCRP; ref. 35), whereas cisplatin has no
strong afﬁnity for any efﬂux transporter. This suggested to us that
high expression of drug efﬂux transporters in KB2P carcinosarcomas could have contributed to their drug resistance phenotype. In
the SAM analysis, expression of Abcb1b (which encodes Pgp
together with Abcb1a) was indeed higher in treatment-na€ve
carcinosarcomas compared with the carcinomas (Supplementary
Fig. S4). We tested expression of Abcb1a, Abcb1b, and Abcg2 in a
semiquantitative manner by RT-MLPA (Fig. 4A). Abcb1a and
Abcb1b were expressed at varying levels in the untreated carcinosarcomas, but three of four carcinosarcomas showed a higher

736 Cancer Res; 75(4) February 15, 2015

KB2P 4

expression than all carcinomas. All carcinosarcomas expressed
increased levels of Abcg2.
To determine whether increased expression of Abcb1a and
Abcb1b was causally related to the drug insensitivity, we tested
the effect of the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar on therapy responses of
carcinosarcomas derived from donors KB2P4 and KB2P6. Tumors
were treated with tariquidar alone; olaparib, docetaxel, or doxorubicin alone; or the drug in combination with tariquidar. In
addition, mice were treated with AZD2461, a novel PARP inhibitor with low afﬁnity for Pgp (22). The effect of the combination
therapy differed between the two donor tumors (Fig. 4B). KB2P4
tumors showed no effect of tariquidar on olaparib sensitivity, a
small delay in outgrowth when docetaxel was combined with
tariquidar, and a clear delay in tumor growth for doxorubicin plus
tariquidar. All KB2P6 tumors responded well to the combination
therapies of tariquidar with olaparib, docetaxel, or doxorubicin.
Also, the response to AZD2461 was comparable with that of
olaparib plus tariquidar. Taken together, these results show that
Pgp contributed substantially to the low drug sensitivity of KB2P6
and, in the case of doxorubicin, of KB2P4.
EMT status correlates with Abcb1b expression in several mouse
mammary tumor models
In several in vitro studies, EMT has been linked to resistance to
various classes of drugs (4). As we observed in our KB2P mouse
model, a positive correlation between an "EMT-like" gene-expression pattern and expression of Abcb1a, Abcb1b, and Abcg2, we
wondered whether this is also the case in other mouse mammary
tumor models. To obtain a continuous value for EMT, we used an
EMT score based on the EMT signature. The score is calculated by
subtracting the average mean-centered log2 expression of the
epithelial genes from the average mean-centered log2 expression
of the mesenchymal genes. We used three different gene-expression datasets from mouse mammary tumors: one that was generated at the NKI and two publicly available datasets. The ﬁrst one
consists of 91 mammary tumors from K14cre or WAPcre-driven
mouse mammary tumor models with conditional deletion of
Trp53 alone (10) or in combination with Cdh1 (36, 37). Similar to
the KB2P model, these models develop two main histopathologic
tumor subtypes: carcinoma and carcinosarcoma. The EMT score of
these tumors signiﬁcantly correlated with Abcb1b and (to a lesser
extend) with Abcb1a and Abcg2 (Fig. 5A). The second and third
datasets are publicly available from Herschkowitz and colleagues
(25) and Zhu and colleagues (26), and contain a collection of 13
and eight different genetically engineered mouse mammary

mostly tumors with a low EMT score, a positive correlation
between EMT score and Abcb1b expression was still detected (Fig.
5B and C). The lack of correlation for Abcb1a and Abcg2 in these
datasets is likely due to the low number of tumors with a high EMT
score. Another possible explanation might be a poor sensitivity of
the oligos on the expression arrays, as we have shown earlier that
this affects the outcome (38).
Interestingly, in line with the KB2P data, the phenotype of
p53D/D tumors not only correlated with Abcb1b expression, but
also with therapy response. Mice with a K14cre;p53D/D (KP)

(Fig. 5D). KP carcinosarcomas, however, respond poorly to docetaxel and only moderately to doxorubicin. Mice with an Abcb1a/
b/ KP tumor (KPA) showed a survival time in response to
docetaxel or doxorubicin, which is in between that of the KP
carcinomas and carcinosarcomas (Fig. 5D, docetaxel-treated sarcomatoid KP vs. KPA P ¼ 0.022; doxorubicin-treated sarcomatoid
KP vs. KPA P ¼ 0.032). This indicates that also in BRCA2proﬁcient tumors, Pgp contributes to the poor response of carcinosarcomas. Ablation of Pgp does not fully sensitize these tumors
to treatment, however, which is consistent with the tariquidar
combination treatments in KB2P tumors shown in Fig. 4.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the role of EMT in anticancer drug
sensitivity in the KB2P mouse model for BRCA2-deﬁcient breast
cancer. We found that a subset of the tumors has a mesenchymal,
sarcomatoid phenotype, and gene-expression proﬁle. These
BRCA2-deﬁcient carcinosarcomas do not respond to several
DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics or the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and are therefore multidrug resistant. They are not panresistant, because they remain highly sensitive to cisplatin, due to
the irreparable deletion inactivating the Brca2 gene, which compromises DNA repair by homologous recombination. We have
previously shown that such a defect in homologous recombination by the irreparable inactivation of Brca1 cannot be overcome
by any known mechanism of resistance to cisplatin (29). We show
in our KB2P model and three other mouse mammary tumor
datasets that an EMT-related transcriptional proﬁle (indicated by a

Time (days)

high EMT score) correlates with high expression of the Abcb1a and
Abcb1b genes, which both encode the drug efﬂux transporter Pgp.
Moreover, KB2P carcinosarcomas could be sensitized to olaparib,
docetaxel, and doxorubicin by the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar. Taken
together, these results indicate that EMT-associated multidrug
resistance is in part driven by increased activity of drug efﬂux
transporters. Similar to the KB2P tumors, p53D/D carcinosarcomas
with high Abcb1b expression responded poorly to docetaxel and
doxorubicin, which could partially be reversed by removal of Pgp,
indicating that the EMT-related resistance phenotype is independent of the BRCA2 status.
To date, only a few studies have investigated a link between
EMT and drug transporter levels. Doxorubicin treatment can
induce EMT in cultured breast cancer cells and upregulate efﬂux
transporters, which is mediated by EMT transcription factors
TWIST1 (39) and ZEB1 (40). Conversely, overexpression of

Multidrug Resistance of Sarcomatoid Mouse Mammary Tumors

SNAI1 in MCF7 cells results in increased Pgp levels after doxorubicin treatment (41), and in increased BCRP (ABCG2) levels
(42). These studies also reported a positive correlation between
SNAIL and Pgp (41), and between SNAIL and BCRP (42), respectively, in human breast cancer tissues.
In contrast with the strong evidence for a causal role of Pgp in
primary and acquired resistance to chemotherapy and targeted
agents in mice (20, 30, 43), the relevance of drug efﬂux transporters for therapy response in patients with breast cancer is still
controversial. Increased Pgp mRNA or protein levels are in some,
but not all, studies related to worse outcome (44). A complication
in these studies is that Pgp (ABCB1) mRNA in tumor extracts may
be derived from nontumor cells, such as macrophages, in the
tumor microenvironment (43).
Over the last decades many clinical studies with transporter
inhibitors have been conducted, with mostly negative results
(34), and overall the impact of drug efﬂux transporters on
patient outcome is likely to be small. This is not due to the
inability of these transporters to cause resistance in real tumors.
We have shown in the BRCA1-deﬁcient mouse breast cancer
model that modest levels of Pgp are sufﬁcient to cause complete
resistance to drugs used in the clinic, such as doxorubicin,
docetaxel, topotecan, or olaparib (20, 30, 43). Obviously,
transporter levels in human tumors are very low and transcriptional activation of the ABCB1 gene does not easily occur in
these tumors (45). Indeed, the gene needs to be linked to a
strong promoter by chromosomal rearrangements for a tumor
to reach sufﬁcient levels of Pgp to acquire drug resistance (46),
and this may be a rare event.
We have considered the possibility that Pgp plays a role in a
small subset of breast cancer, such as metaplastic breast cancer.
However, we did not ﬁnd any correlation with ABCB1 expression
and a high EMT score in metaplastic tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S5). This does not mean that Pgp could not play a role in some
patients with acquired or secondary resistance. Unfortunately,
matched samples of initially sensitive and subsequently drugrefractory tumors are hardly available from individual patients
with breast cancer to address this issue.
Pgp contributes to multidrug resistance in KB2P carcinosarcomas, but our ﬁnding that KB2P4 is still insensitive to
PARP inhibition and only modestly responsive to docetaxel
and doxorubicin when Pgp is inhibited by tariquidar strongly
suggest that other factors in the EMT program contribute as
well. For example, the damage induced by PARPi and docetaxel in KB2P4 can still be compensated by another yet
unknown mechanism, whereas doxorubicin-induced damage
(47) is not compensated by EMT-related drug resistance in
this tumor. Such EMT-associated factors could also contribute
to the EMT-related drug resistance that is frequently observed in human cancer cells in vitro. In humans, metaplastic and
claudin-low breast cancers are both associated with EMT
and a triple-negative phenotype. Metaplastic breast cancers
are often refractory to treatment and have a poor prognosis
compared with other triple-negative breast cancers (48). The
claudin-low subtype has a worse pCR rate than the basal-like
group (8, 9). Several studies have demonstrated the predictive
value of EMT markers (single or in combination) for prognosis and relapse-free survival (49–51), but which proteins in
the EMT program eventually cause low drug sensitivity in
general and to which drugs speciﬁcally still requires further
investigation.

www.aacrjournals.org

Even though several studies have shown that drug treatment,
especially with doxorubicin, can induce EMT in vitro, we have
not observed this phenomenon in any of our treated KB2P
carcinomas. A possible explanation is that other resistance
mechanisms are more easily activated, although it is not clear
what these mechanisms might be, other than Pgp upregulation.
Another option is that the carcinomas and carcinosarcomas
arise from a different cell of origin, for example, a luminal or
myoepithelial progenitor cell, respectively, in which K14 is
expressed (10), and that they therefore do not easily switch
from one type to another. This low plasticity is also illustrated
by the small effect of Snai1 or Twist overexpression on the
phenotype of KB2P tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo (data
not shown).
Our data show that sarcomatoid HR-deﬁcient mammary
tumors respond better to cisplatin than to the PARP inhibitor
olaparib. This could potentially be clinically relevant, although
two major differences between human and mouse tumors
must be taken into account: (i) the controversial role of drug
transporters in human cancers as described above and (ii) the
large, irreversible deletion of exon 11 of Brca2 in this mouse
model. Also for carcinomas, a side-by-side comparison of
PARP inhibitors versus platinum drugs would be informative.
In addition to BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancers also cancers
with a BRCA-like CGH pattern would be useful to include. It
has been shown that these are highly sensitive to platinumbased intensiﬁed chemotherapy (52) and it would be very
interesting to investigate whether the same effect is achieved
with PARP inhibition.
In summary, we show the usefulness of studying multidrug
resistance in a realistic mouse model of BRCA2-deﬁcient breast
cancer. We found that enhanced expression of Pgp contributes
to multidrug resistance associated with a sarcomatoid tumor
phenotype. In addition, our data suggest that the correlation
between a high EMT signature score and high expression of Pgp
is a general phenomenon in mouse models of breast cancer.
Pan-resistance is likely to be an accumulation of multiple
mechanisms, and mouse models could be useful to unravel
the different layers of resistance.
