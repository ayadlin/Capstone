BACKGROUND: The importance of definitive histological subclassification has increased as drug trials have shown
benefit associated with histology in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The acuity of this problem is further exacerbated by the use of minimally invasive cytology samples. Here we describe the development and validation of a 4protein classifier that differentiates primary lung adenocarcinomas (AC) from squamous cell carcinomas (SCC).
METHODS: Quantitative immunofluorescence (AQUA) was employed to measure proteins differentially expressed
between AC and SCC followed by logistic regression analysis. An objective 4-protein classifier was generated to
define likelihood of AC in a training set of 343 patients followed by validation in 2 independent cohorts (n ¼ 197 and
n ¼ 235). The assay was then tested on 11 cytology specimens. RESULTS: Statistical modeling selected thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), CK5, CK13, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to generate a weighted classifier
and to identify the optimal cutpoint for differentiating AC from SCC. Using the pathologist’s final diagnosis as the criterion standard, the molecular test showed a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 93%. Blinded analysis of the validation sets yielded sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 97%, respectively. Our assay classified the cytology specimens
with a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 87.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular classification of NSCLC using an objective quantitative test can be highly accurate and could be translated into a diagnostic platform for broad clinical

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, predominantly nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the most common cause of death from cancer
worldwide, with 70% to 80% of the cases presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease.1 NSCLC diagnosis and
histological subclassification is mainly performed by morphological assessment, mucin stains, and immunohistochemical
detection of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and TP63.2 However, the increased diagnostic use of cytology specimens has emerged as a limiting factor for the traditional characterization of NSCLC.
Advances in targeted therapies for NSCLC revealed that histology is predictive of clinical efficacy outcomes; the
most robust evidence coming from increased response rates to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine
kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib,3,4 and absence of hemorrhagic complications with vascular endothelial growth
factor inhibitors5,6 and the molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib7 for tumors with adenocarcinoma

(AC) histology. The association of histology with outcome of conventional chemotherapy remains highly controversial; recently higher response rates have been
reported for AC patients treated with the pemetrexed/cisplatin doublet8 highlighting the need for a standardized
assay to stratify patients for such treatments.
The misclassification rates for an AC diagnosis can
be as high as 25%, especially when comparing biopsy or
cytology specimens to resections;9-15 mistyping rate also
depends on whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) was
used as an adjunct for diagnosis. Despite the unmet need
for a robust test to adequately classify lung cancer patients
by histology there is no routinely used molecular tool to
distinguish between NSCLC histological subtypes. Here
we developed an objective quantitative immunofluorescence test that can accurately distinguish SCC from AC
histology on tissue microarrays (TMAs) as well as scant
cytology samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cohorts
Three cohorts of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
primary NSCLC tumors were used: The training set was a
retrospectively collected cohort of 343 NSCLC patients
diagnosed between 1991 and 2001, obtained from Sotiria
Hospital (Athens, Greece) and Patras Hospital (Rion,
Greece). The second cohort was retrospectively collected
from 197 patients from Yale-New Haven Hospital (New
Haven, Conn) between January 1995 and May 2003. The
third cohort was a prospectively collected cohort of 235
NSCLC patients diagnosed between 1991 and 2001,
obtained from the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa,
Fla). Demographics and tumor characteristics are shown in
Table 1. Histological final diagnosis was based on the
pathology records for all samples. Histological classification
was determined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung tumors;16 stage was

(AJCC) staging system.17 The study was approved by the
institutional review boards of all centers; written informed
consent was obtained for each case.
Cytology Specimens
Eleven lung FNAs were retrieved from Yale Department
of Pathology Archives; cases were chosen on the basis of
increased difficulty for a definite histological diagnosis by
standard pathology assessment. Eight cytology specimens
were characterized as NSCLC, 2 as AC, and 1 as SCC.
Histological diagnosis was set/confirmed by matching
core needle biopsies (n ¼ 8) or lobectomies (n ¼ 3); 8 AC
and 3 SCC were identified.
Tissue Microarrays
Tissue specimens were prepared in a TMA format containing
2 0.6-mm representative FFPE tumor cores for each primary
tumor. FFPE cell line pellets were used as controls: HT29,
Calu-1, H1299, A549, SW-480, H1666, H1355, A431,
HCC2279, H1819, HCC193, HC15, MCF7, H2882, and

sis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred at 45 V for 2 hours to a
nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots were probed with
primary antibodies (Table 2) diluted 1:1000, followed by
antirabbit or antimouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) diluted 1:4000 and detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). b-tubulin (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, Mass) was used to observe the total
protein loading.
Quantitative Immunofluorescence
TMAs and cytology specimens were antigen-retrieved in
10 mM citrate or 10 mM Tris/1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer for all antibodies but EGFR;
proteinase K (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) digestion was performed instead. Slides were incubated with a cocktail of
the primary antibody (Table 2) and a mouse monoclonal
(M3515, Dako) or a polyclonal rabbit cytokeratin antibody (Z0622, Dako) overnight at 4 C. This was followed
by a 1-hour incubation with Alexa 546-conjugated goat
antimouse (A11003, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore) or
Alexa 546-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody
(A11010, Molecular Probes) diluted 1:100 in rabbit

Mass) diluted 1:50 was used for target detection. Prolong
mounting medium (P36931, Molecular Probes) containing
40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to identify nuclei. Serial sections of a smaller specialized NSCLC
TMA (NSCLC control array) were stained aside all cohorts
and batches of cytology specimens to confirm assay reproducibility. Positive controls used are described in Table 2.
Negative control sections, in which the primary antibody
was omitted, were used for each immunostaining run.
Image Collection and Analysis
Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis (AQUA)
allows exact measurement of protein concentration within
subcellular compartments.18 In brief, high-resolution
DAPI, cytokeratin, and target-Cy5 monochromatic
images were captured by the PM-2000 microscope (HistoRx, New Haven, Conn). Tumor was distinguished by
creating an epithelial tumor ‘‘mask’’ from the cytokeratin
signal on the basis of an intensity threshold. AQUA score
of target proteins were calculated by dividing the sum of
the target compartment pixel intensities by the area of the
compartment within they were measured. AQUA scores
were normalized to the exposure time and bit depth at
which the images were captured, allowing scores collected
at different exposure times to be directly comparable.
Specimens with less that 5% tumor area per region of interest were not included in AQUA analysis for not being
representative of the corresponding tumor specimen.
Statistical Analysis
Data normalization

AQUA scores were Log2 normalized and scores of the
validation sets were further normalized for run-to-run variability based on a normalization curve generated from the
control TMA. Cases with missing values were excluded
from analysis. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used
to assess correlations between the same cores on serial cuts
of the NSCLC control array. An R2 greater than 0.8 was indicative of good inter- and intraarray reproducibility, and
thus the average AQUA scores for all target proteins were
calculated and treated as independent continuous variables.
Selection of predictors and classifier development

Differences in biomarker expression between ACs and
SCCs were assessed with the Wilcoxon sum rank test; proteins differentially expressed in ACs versus SCCs at a level
of significance of .05 in more than 5% of the tumor specimens were further analyzed in a nominal logistic regression
model following a backward elimination stepwise selection

1610

process (entry P ¼ .05, removal P ¼ .1). Negative log likelihood was used as an indicator for overall model fit and the
Wald statistic was used to test the significance of parameter
estimates. In the stepwise selection process predictors with
the least impact on model fit were removed from the model
and the minimum number of predictors included in the
reduced model was determined by the Akaike’s Information
criterion (AIC).20 To address the issue of model over fitting
1000 bootstrap samples were generated and a backward
elimination logistic regression model was developed for
each bootstrap sample;19 the final multivariable model
included those variables that were significant at the .05 level.
The probability of prediction of AC histology for each specimen in the training cohort was calculated as a linear combination of the protein AQUA scores weighted by the logistic
regression estimates as follows:

with values ranges from 0 (true SCC) to 1 (true AC).
The final classifier was adjusted for clinical variables
and applied to 2 validation cohorts as well as cytology
specimens.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
method was applied to show the sensitivity and specificity
for various cutoff values on scores of the training and validation sets; Youden’s index (J) was used to measure overall
diagnostic effectiveness and select the cutoff score with the
optimal differentiating ability between AC and SCC.21 Differences in clinical variables among the 3 cohorts were
assessed by chi square and Kruskal Wallis H testing. All
P values were based on 2-sided testing and differences were
considered significant at P < .05. All statistical analyses
were done using SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill) and the R-statistics software (version 2.9.0).

RESULTS
Antibody Validation and Assay
Standardization
Total protein levels were independently detected by
AQUA analysis and WB in cell line controls and cell lines
showed the same range of protein expression on both
AQUA and Western Blot (WB) analysis (Fig. 1). Serial sections of the control TMA were stained in each IHC run to
confirm assay reproducibility; this allows for the construction of a normalization standard curve to adjust for run to
run variability. AQUA scores were thus normalized based
on the control TMA standard curve. Evaluation of the assay

reproducibility did not reveal significant differences
between serial sections of the NSCLC control array stained
in each IHC run (R ¼ 0.91-0.97 for all runs, P < .0001).

Identification of Predictors of Histology
We used AQUA analysis to identify biomarkers that differentiate AC from SCC; among 24 proteins assessed (Table
2) CK5, CK13, EGFR, MENA, CK14, Cleaved Caspase 3
(CC3), and CK17 were expressed at significantly higher levels in SCCs and TTF1, HER2, and phospho p70 S6K were
significantly higher in ACs (Table 3). These proteins were
tested for intratumor heterogeneity by comparing
AQUA scores of redundant cores. We found a highly significant correlation for all proteins analyzed (R ¼ 0.63-0.92,
P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). HER2 and CC3 were
excluded from subsequent analysis because of less than 5%
positive specimens; cases with values missing at random
were also excluded from the analysis.

Development of the Classifier
An overview of the classifier development is shown in Figure 2. CK5, CK13, CK14, CK17, EGFR, MENA, phospho p70 S6K, and TTF1 continuous AQUA scores were
incorporated in a multivariate nominal logistic regression
model following a backward elimination stepwise selection process for each of 1000 bootstrap samples; the probability of prediction of AC histology was calculated as
linear combination of TTF1, CK5, CK13, and EGFR
AQUA scores weighted as follows:

model adjusting for tumor stage and differentiation; only
the 4-protein classifier was included in the reduced model.
Based on these findings and after performing internal
validation we established our diagnostic platform and used
the score of 0.49 as a cutoff point for the optimal AC versus
SCC classification.
Classifier Validation
The power of the molecular classifier was tested in the validation cohort 1 (n ¼ 197); the 4 proteins were measured
in a blinded analysis as specified above. Eighty-six AC
samples had a score of 0.49-0.99, whereas 29 SCC sam-

ples had a score of 0 to 0.489 without any overlap; 7 AC
(7.52%) and 1 SCC (3.33%) specimens were misclassified respectively (Table 4). With the cutoff point for classification between AC and SCC set at 0.49 our test had a
sensitivity of 92% (CI, 85.2-96.3%), specificity of 97%
(CI, 83.3-99.4%), PPV 98.88%, NPV 80.55%, and
AUC equal to 0.984 (CI, 0.964-1.004; Fig. 5A). To test
the robustness of our classifier we further validated the
assay in a cohort of 235 NSCLC patients. AC scores
ranged from 0.49 to 0.99 and SCC scores from 0.0003 to
0.489 with the exception of 3 (4%) AC cases and 2
(3.27%) SCC misclassified specimens (Table 4). The sensitivity and specificity of identifying an AC were 96% (CI,
88.8-98.6%) and 97% (CI, 86.7-98.3%), respectively;

cut point of 0.49. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 92.3%, 96.6%, and 0.984 for validation set 1 and 96%, 96.7%, and 0.989 for
validation cohort 2; specimen scores in ascending order in inset.

PPV was 97.29%, NPV 95.16%, and AUC was 0.989
(CI, 0.977-1.003; Fig. 5B). The classifier was independent of tumor and patient characteristics for both validation cohorts.
Assay Performance on Cytology Samples
Our assay was applied in a blinded manner to 11 hard to
classify cytology specimens and the histological subtype
predicted was compared with the final histological diagnosis obtained from pathology review of matched core
needle biopsies or resections. Seven of 8 AC and 3 of 3
SCC were correctly classified yielding specificity of 100%,
sensitivity of 87.5% and an AUC of 0.958. PPV and
NPV were 100% and 75%, respectively (Fig. 6A). Of
note, histological subtype was identified for only 3 of 11

1614

cytology samples, whereas 8 specimens were characterized
as ‘‘NSCLC’’ on initial pathology review.

Classification of Other Histological Subtypes
We explored the use of our classifier in other histological
subtypes. We hypothesized that adenosquamous (AS)
tumors were more likely to be AC-like or SCC-like rather
than a distinct entity. Eight (57%) and 6 (43%) of the
tumors with a morphological diagnosis of AS showed an
expression profile similar to AC or SCC, respectively,
when the 4-protein classifier was applied (Fig. 6B). We further applied our classifier to large cell (LCC; Fig. 6C) and
giant cell carcinomas; scores spanned the full range of 0 to 1
without preferentially clustering close to any end of the axis.

Figure 6. Classification of cytology specimens, adenosquamous (AS), large cell carcinomas (LCC), and giant cell tumors. All SCC
cytology samples (blue squares) were identified as SCC and 7 out of 8 AC cytology samples (red squares) were identified as AC
(A). AS tumors (n ¼ 14, light blue squares) were classified as either AC or SCC (B); our assay was unable to classify LCC and
giant cell carcinomas that spanned the full spectrum between 0 and 1 (C).

DISCUSSION
NSCLC is routinely classified based on morphological features however gene expression profiling,22 proteomic,23 and
IHC24-26 studies reveal systematic differences between AC
and SCC; rendering the NSCLC subclassification a matter of
distinct biomarker profiles rather than a stratification based
on morphological assessment. Here we investigated the differential expression of 24 biomarkers and identified a high
correlation of EGFR, CK5, and CK13 with SCC and TTF1
with AC histology consistent with previous studies.24,26-30
These quantitative measurements were used to generate a
weighted classifier in a training set of 343 NSCLC patients,
followed by internal validation and external validation in 2
independent NSCLC cohorts, as well as cytology specimens.
The sensitivity and specificity for an AC diagnosis
has been studied by investigating the agreement between
original and review diagnosis and has been found to be as
low as 80.8%.9-12,31 A case-control study assessing the
agreement between regional and central pathologists demonstrated an 81% observed agreement for AC diagnosis.13
Comparisons between preoperative bronchial biopsies
and matched resections revealed an overall concordance
of 77% for AC diagnosis.14 Reliable subclassification of
NSCLC is particularly challenging on scant material, and
the rate for correct preoperative histological subclassification has been found to be 35% when bronchial biopsies
and cytology specimens were used.15 The misclassification
rates, however, depend on the size and nature of biopsy
obtained as well as use of IHC as adjunct for diagnosis.
To adjudicate difficult cases, the pathologist often
uses IHC. The panel routinely used to aid morphological

diagnosis and differentiate between AC and SCC consists
of TTF1 and p63; the former identifying ACs and the
later SCCs. However TTF1 is expressed in about 85% of
primary lung ACs2,24 and 32% of SCCs,24 whereas p63
expression has been reported for 30% of ACs.32 The
TTF1/p63 classification system has been shown to have a
sensitivity of 74.6% leaving 14% to 37% of NSCLC
tumors unclassified.33 Ring et al33 developed a more sophisticated approach using a 5-protein (TRIM29, CEACAM5, SLC7A5, MUC1, and CK5/6) test combined
with a semiqualitative scoring system and arbitrary cut
points for biomarker positivity. This assay had 88.6% sensitivity and 85.9% specificity, with 12% of cases remaining unclassified. Although our assay is similar because it is
based on a series of immunoassays, we have achieved
greater accuracy and our quantitative test allows more precise measurement of expression even on scant material.
Micro-RNA assays represent another approach to
NSCLC classification and miR-205 has been shown to
be an accurate marker for SCCs.34,35 The sensitivity and
specificity for the miR-205 assay are 96% and 90%,
respectively, when using cutoffs for high confidence
classification; our test using a single cutoff point yielded
96% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity. Although the
miR-205 assay represents an alternative molecular
mechanism of classification and confirms the biological
differentiation we observed, it is a destructive test adding the question of tissue sampled into the mix. Analysis
of specimens that contain very little tumor and many
inflammatory cells or other nontumor tissue would
result in inaccurate readings.

The selection process of the 4 strongest predictors
reflects the molecular background of the tumors analyzed;
CK14 being an obligate partner for CK5 was excluded
from the reduced model, and we observed cellular colocalization and tight parametric correlations between partners
CK5 and CK14 (R ¼ 0.563, P < .01) both predominantly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas. CK17 also
excluded from the final model is another basal cell typical
keratin typically coexpressed with CK5/CK14; we
observed such an association with CK17 protein measurements tightly correlating with CK5 and CK14 protein
concentrations (R ¼ 0.73, P < .001 and R ¼ 0.49, P ¼
.01, respectively). On the contrary, the CK4/CK13 pair
has a different tissue distribution mainly localized in the
suprabasal compartment of stratified squamous epithelia;
therefore, CK13 (or CK4/CK13) would not be a surrogate
for CK5 (or CK5/CK14), which is consistent with our
findings (R ¼ 0.204, ¼ .1 for the CK5-CK13 correlation).
Interestingly, biomarkers expected to play an important
role in both ACs and SCCs including the transcription factor STAT3 and cancer cell survival and growth regulators
AKT and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were
excluded from the reduced model reflecting the ‘‘shared’’
molecular pathways between ACs and SCCs.
We used the local pathologist review as a criterion
standard for NSCLC histological classification. In etiologic
research we aim for the best assessment of an exposure variable; however, when we develop a model applicable in daily
practice definitions and scorings in line with daily practice
should be used.36 NSCLC subclassification is determined by
local pathology reports with expert review in some but not
all of the cases; we used local review as the criterion standard
to avoid dilution of the prediction relationship due to differences between clinical practice and research setting.
Our preliminary analysis on AS specimens revealed
that these tumors did not form a distinct group but could
be classified either as AC or SCC. Our test was unable to
accurately classify LCC or giant cell tumors, suggesting a
biologically unrelated disease matching the distinct morphology of these less common tumors. The LCC diagnosis
is often a diagnosis of exclusion and the criteria to make a
histological diagnosis of LCC are somewhat nonspecific. It
has been shown that modified diagnostic criteria indicate
that some tumors previously classified as LCCs could fall in
the category of undifferentiated AC or SCC.37
However, this work is also subject to a series of limitations. Specifically, we developed the assay using only
fields collected from TMA spots. Although this provides a
compelling result, TMAs are never used in routine diag-

1616

nostics and generalizability of the assay becomes a relevant
issue outside the TMA setting where large series of samples are tested under identical conditions to form a distribution. Quantitative immunofluorescence has been used
for whole tissue section studies and comparison of AQUA
derived clinical cut off points with conventional IHC has
been described.38 We have shown that using a control
TMA aside each IHC run adjusts for run to run variability
in a standardized manner; whole tissue sections could thus
be routinely processed and normalized back to the original
TMA-derived scores. TMA field-of-view numbers (corresponding to 0.0002% of the whole tumor39) are not dissimilar from cytology specimens where classification is
particularly challenging. Our preliminary analysis of 11
hard-to-classify cytology specimens showed that our standardized molecular assay was reproducible and accurate even
on scant material. We are currently testing the assay on a
large series of cytology specimens in a prospective manner.
Another limitation is that our cohorts were retrospectively collected and not well matched in terms of clinical characteristics. We believe the similarity of the results
in all cohorts and the independent predictive value of our
assay highlights its robustness. Finally, our assay is not
specifically linked to any therapeutic intervention. Identification of the histological type is, after all, a surrogate
endpoint; the real endpoint of interest is response to a particular chemotherapeutic approach. Although this is not a
true limitation of the test, trials linking this assay to a specific drug may improve the connection between histology
and response and/or occurrence of adverse effects.
In conclusion, we have developed a highly reproducible, objective, easily applicable quantitative assay for subclassification of NSCLC. Once validated in a prospective
manner this test could easily be translated into a robust
diagnostic platform for broad clinical application. We
believe that identifying the histological and molecular
properties of tumors more likely to respond to specific
treatments will result in the fine tuning of personalized
therapy toward the goal of maximizing survival outcomes
for lung cancer patients.
