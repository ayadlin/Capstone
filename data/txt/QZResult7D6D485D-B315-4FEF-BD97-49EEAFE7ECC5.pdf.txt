Abstract
Aberrant promoter hypermethylation and associated gene
silencing are epigenetic hallmarks of tumorigenesis. It has
been suggested that aberrant DNA methylation can affect the
sensitivity of cancers to antineoplastic agents by altering
expression of genes critical to drug response. To study this
issue, we used bisulfite PCR to assess DNA methylation of 32
promoter-associated CpG islands in human cancer cell lines
from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug-screening panel
(NCI-60 panel). The frequency of aberrant hypermethylation
of these islands ranged from 2% to 81% in NCI-60 cancer cells,
and provided a database that can be analyzed for the
sensitivity to 30,000 drugs tested in this panel. By correlating
drug activity with DNA methylation, we identified a list of
methylation markers that predict sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Among them, hypermethylation of the p53
homologue p73 and associated gene silencing was strongly
correlated with sensitivity to alkylating agents. We used small
interfering RNA to down-regulate p73 expression in multiple
cell lines, including the resistant cell lines TK10 (renal cancer)
and SKMEL28 (melanoma). Down-regulating p73 substantially
increased sensitivity to commonly used alkylating agents,
including cisplatin, indicating that epigenetic silencing of
p73 directly modulates drug sensitivity. Our results confirm
that epigenetic profiles are useful in identifying molecular
mediators for cancer drug sensitivity (pharmaco-epigenomics).

Introduction
The NCI has established a panel of cell lines (NCI-60) and used it
to screen compounds for anticancer activity over the last decades
(1). At this moment, the NCI-60 cells constitute the most
extensively and diversely characterized cell panel anywhere, and
several databases have been generated based on these cell lines,
such as drug activity database for >30,000 chemically defined
compounds, expression profile of >8,000 different genes, and
selected genetic changes (2). Genome-wide gene expression
profiling of the NCI-60 cell lines (3) identified strong associations
between selected gene expression and chemosensitivity in this
panel, suggesting that gene-drug interactions may be useful for
predicting the responsiveness of cancer cells to anticancer agents.

CpG island methylation is now recognized as a common feature
of many human neoplasms (4–6). Methylation changes markspecific pathways in tumorigenesis that seem to result from
distinct exposures and may have important prognostic and
therapeutic implications (7–9). Methylation profiling may therefore
provide valuable clinical information. Studies have suggested
that DNA methylation could provide a good molecular marker
to predict sensitivity to chemotherapy (10–12); for instance, O 6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation indicates sensitivity to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) in
gliomas, CHFR (checkpoint with FHA and RING finger) methylation
indicates sensitivity to microtubule inhibitors in gastric and oral
squamous cell cancers, and methylation of WRN (Werner
syndrome gene) predicts good clinical response to a topoisomerase
inhibitor irinotecan. Based on these, we hypothesized that DNA
methylation could provide good molecular marker to indicate the
sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we report a
methylation profile of 32 CpG islands in the NCI-60 cell lines. As a
proof of principle, by correlating DNA methylation with drug
response, we show that p73 methylation and silencing of this gene
predicts sensitivity to alkylating agents, and down-regulation of
p73 gene expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitized
the resistant cell lines to several alkylating agents tested.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. A total of 58 cell lines were obtained from the NCI Anticancer
Drug Screen Panel, including seven cell lines from breast cancer, six from
the central nervous system, seven from colon cancer, six from leukemia,
eight from melanoma, nine from non–small cell lung cancer, six from
ovarian cancer, two from prostate cancer, and seven from renal cancer.
Genomic DNA was extracted from these cell lines using a standard phenolchloroform method, and total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For siRNA or short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown experiment, two human renal carcinoma
cells, TK10 and 786-0, and one human melanoma cell, SK-MEL28, were
grown in RPMI medium (TK10 and 786-0) or DMEM (SK-MEL28) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Bisulfite-PCR methylation analysis. Bisulfite-based PCR method was
used for methylation study as reported previously (13). We used both
combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA; ref. 14) and methylationsensitive PCR (MSP; ref. 15) assay to analyze the methylation status. In brief,
COBRA assay relies on bisulfite-induced RFLPs; that is, methylated bands
are digested by restriction enzymes but unmethylated bands are not.
Digested PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 6%
polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, imaged,
and quantitated in a Bio-Rad Geldoc 2000 imager (Bio-Rad). The
methylation density for each sample was computed as a ratio of the
density of the digested band to the density of all bands in a given lane. MSPPCR products also were visualized on acrylamide gels as described earlier,
and quantitated by densitometric determination of the density of the band
in the methylated lane divided by the sum of the bands in both methylated

and unmethylated lanes. Most of the assays used have previously been
published (16–31), including validation of methylation for multiple sites
within each island, correlation with other techniques (Southern blotting
and bisulfite-pyrosequencing), and lack of PCR bias. Primer sequences, PCR
conditions, and restriction enzymes used for COBRA are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Clustering of human cancer cell lines according to CpG island
promoter hypermethylation. Using Euclidean distances and average
linkage algorithm, we applied an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis
of NCI-60 cell lines on the basis of methylation measured as continuous
variables. A color-coded cluster image map was generated using CIMminer
(Cluster Image Map Program Package) software tool (3, 32).3 Cell lines with
correlated methylation profiles were identified using the Pearson’s
correlation coefficient (r), which was taken as a measure of similarity or
distance between values. The output file was visualized as a binary tree. The
scale above the dendrogram depicts the correlation coefficient represented
by the branches connecting pairs of nodes.

Drug activity profiles. The drug activity profiles of anticancer agents
are available online.4 Growth inhibition was assessed from the changes in
total cellular protein after 48 h of drug treatment using a sulforhodamine B
assay. Drug activities (log10 GI50) were recorded across the human cancer
cell lines and GI50 is calculated by the concentration required to inhibit cell
growth by 50% compared with untreated controls.
Chemosensitivity prediction. First, we used quantitative methylation
level of each gene (continuous variable) as a seed for COMPARE analysis,
which includes >30,000 chemical compounds tested. COMPARE was
originally developed by Paull et al. (33) to analyze the pattern for a ‘‘seed’’
among the NCI-60 cancer cells; this method determines Pearson correlation
coefficients for the seed against each of the compounds in the database and
results in a list of the highest correlations. In this analysis, Bonferroni
adjustment was used to determine the possible significance of two-tailed
P values; for instance, standard agent database is made up of 170
compounds; therefore, only P values <0.05/170 = 0.0003 is considered as
statistically significant. A positive correlation indicates that a greater
abundance of the seed (methylation) may be associated with sensitivity to
the drug, whereas a negative correlation is indicative of more methylation
of target gene conferring cellular resistance to the given drug.
Next, we generated a drug response profile (sensitive, intermediate, and
resistant) of the NCI-60 cell lines to 118 standard anticancer agents whose

mechanisms of action have been defined (32, 34). For each drug, cell lines
with log10 (GI50) values at least 0.8 SD above the mean were defined as
resistant to this drug; and cell lines with log10 (GI50) at least 0.8 SD below
the mean were defined as sensitive to the drug. The remaining cell lines
with log10 (GI50) within 0.8 SD were defined as intermediate to the range of
drug responses.
Reverse transcription-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blot for P73 expression analysis. Two micrograms of total RNA were
used as a template to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) by random
hexamers and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Roche). Reverse transcription
samples without reverse transcriptase were also used in each case as
negative controls. One thirtieth of cDNA product was used to amplify a
306-bp product of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
gene as an RNA quality control. The primers for GAPDH were:
CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT (sense) and AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC (antisense). One tenth of the cDNA was used to amplify a
181-bp product of the p73 gene. The primers for p73 were TTGAGCACCTCTGGAGCTCT (sense) and ATCTGGTCCATGGTGCTGC (antisense).
PCR conditions were as follows (in 50 AL reaction volume): 15 min at 95jC
for initial denaturation, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95jC, 30 s at 55jC,
and 30 s at 72jC, with a final extension at 72jC for 10 min. PCR products
were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.
Quantitative real-time PCR assay was carried out using ABI Prism 7700
sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) by the following parameters: 95jC
(15 min) followed by 40 cycles of 94jC (15 s), and 60jC (30 s). Primers and
probes for p73 and GAPDH were purchased from Applied Biosystems
(design no. HS00232088-m1 for p73 to specifically amplify transcripts from
TA promoter). A relative gene expression level was calculated by the ratio of
the target p73 gene to GAPDH gene expression using Sequence Detector
Systems version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems).
Western blots for TAp73 protein expression (Imgenex) were done as
previously reported (35). Equal protein loading was confirmed by blotting
with control antibody against GAPDH (Novus).
Down-regulation of p73 expression by RNAi approaches. siRNAs
targeting p73 were designed and prepared as reported previously (36). The
siRNA sequences were as follows: p73-siRNA: 5¶-CGGAUUCCAGCAUGGACGUdTdT-3¶ and 5¶-dTdTGCCUAAGGUCGUACCUGCA-3¶; scrambled siRNA:
5¶-UAGCCACCACUGACGACCUdTdT-3¶ and 5¶-dTdTAUCGGUGGUGACUGCUGGA-3¶.
RNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Dharmacon. One day before
transfection, cells were seeded such as they were 30% to 50% confluent the
next day. Cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L of siRNA using

Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I reduced
serum medium (Invitrogen) for 5 h. The medium was removed and replaced
with fresh RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS. Control cells were treated
with scrambled siRNA. Down-regulation of p73 expression in SK-MEL28
cells was achieved by retrovirus vector (RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ
Vector)–mediated shRNA targeting the same region as p73-siRNA. After
infection and selection, we obtained five single clones and bulk cells for
further analysis.
Measurement of growth inhibition and apoptosis in the cell lines
before and after cisplatin treatment. Dilutions of cisplatin (Sigma;
concentration ranged from 1 to 50 Amol/L), BCNU (Sigma, concentration
ranged from 12.5 to 200 Amol/L), and carboplatin (MP Biomedicals,
concentration ranged from 12.5 to 200 Amol/L) were freshly prepared
before each experiment. Cells were allowed to recover from siRNA
treatment for 48 h before the treatment. After exposure to each compound
for 48 h, cell growth inhibition was measured by hemocytometry with
trypan blue dye exclusion. Detection and quantification of apoptotic cells
by Annexin V staining were done by flow cytometric analysis at the core
facility in M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. All the experiments were
repeated at least three times.

Results
Methylation profile of NCI-60 cancer cell lines. The
methylation profile of NCI-60 cell lines was determined by testing
the methylation status of 32 CpG islands. All but one (MINT2) of
the CpG islands we tested correspond to promoters of specific
genes. These included four cell cycle regulatory genes (p16INK4a,
p14ARF, p15INK4b , and p57KIP ), two DNA repair genes (MGMT and
hMLH1), five angiogenesis-related genes (THBS1, THBS4, TIMP3,
E-cadherin, and DAPK), four mediator of apoptosis genes (TMS1,
RIL, p73, and BNIP3), two drug metabolism genes (GSTP1 and
MDR1), eight signal transduction genes (ERa, RARb2, COX2, cABL,
RASSF1A, p101, MINT31 corresponding to the calcium channel
CACNA1G gene, and MINT25 corresponding to the calcineurin
binding protein 1, CABIN1 gene), two transcription regulator genes
(RIZ1 and KR18), and others (CD10, LPH3, Megalin, and MINT1
corresponding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C, SV2C gene).
We used COBRA as a quantitative test to study methylation of
all the genes except for p73, RIZ1, RASSF1A, RARh2, TIMP3, GSTP1,

and CDH1 (E-cadherin), for which we used MSP. The data for KR18,
THBS4, Megalin, p101, and LPH3 genes were previously reported
(24) and used here for analysis of drug sensitivity. All methylation
data are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Representative
examples of methylation analysis are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1, and the frequency of aberrant methylation according to
tissue type is summarized in Table 1. At least one gene is
hypermethylated in all cell lines, and >90% of cell lines have
aberrant methylation of at least four genes.
Clustering of human cancer cell lines according to their
CpG island methylation profile. To elucidate tissue specificity of
methylation changes, we did cluster analyses on the basis of gene
methylation patterns (Supplementary Fig. S2A). With average
linkage clustering and a correlation metric, cell lines derived from
leukemia and colon cancer showed tight clustering into independent terminal branches specific to their respective organ types
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Cell lines derived from other malignancies, however, were distributed in multiple different terminal
branches, suggesting that their methylation patterns were more
heterogeneous. This analysis may be biased by the inclusion of
several genes initially identified as methylated in colon cancer.
Correlation between gene expression and methylation.
Among 32 CpG island–associated genes we analyzed, we obtained
gene expression results based on microarrays for 17 genes in the
NCI-60 database. We therefore correlated methylation with
expression and found that promoter methylation correlated well
with gene expression in 12 genes (Supplementary Table S3).
However, there were exceptions. For example, because there was
only one cell line with hMLH1 or c-Abl hypermethylation, the
correlation between methylation and expression was weak for both
genes (R = 0.25, P = 0.185 for hMLH1 and R = 0.22, P = 0.13 for
c-Abl, respectively); for p57, an imprinted gene, the correlation
between methylation and expression was also weak (R = 0.24,
P = 0.07). The correlation between methylation and expression for
MDR1 gene was not significant, possibly because the methylation
assay was designed based on a CpG island located in the intron

1 region (R = 0.22, P = 0.09). Alternatively, nonsignificant
correlation could occur when gene repression results from other
mechanisms independent of DNA methylation and/or microarray
gene expressions are prone to probe and background effects that
may confound such correlation in the absence of statistical
algorithms designed to account for these effects. We found that
there was no significant correlation between p73 gene methylation
and expression by microarray, perhaps due to complicated gene
structure with multiple alternate transcripts of this gene. To
address this, we did reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) designed
specifically for the methylation-targeted promoter of p73 (TA
promoter), and found an excellent correlation between methylation
and expression by both conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR
(Fig. 1).
We then correlated methylation with the expression of
epigenetic modifiers. For each cell line, we defined a methylation
index (MI) as the ratio between the number of methylated genes
and the number of analyzed genes and divided the cell lines into
methylation low (MI <0.2), moderate (MI between 0.2 and 0.4), and
high (MI >0.4). As shown in Supplementary Table S4, there was
no correlation between methylation and the expression levels of
DNMT3a, DNMT3b, or any other epigenetic modifiers examined.
Predicting anticancer drug sensitivity by methylation. We
next tested whether DNA methylation profiling in the NCI-60 panel
predicts drug sensitivity or resistance. First, we used COMPARE
analysis to correlate methylation of each marker with drug
response at the GI50 (50% growth inhibition) level of effect. The
correlation coefficient and P values are provided in Table 2 for
standard agents, in Supplementary Table S5 for compounds
selected for evaluation by the Biological Evaluation Committee of
the Developmental Therapeutics Program, and in Supplementary
Table S6 for open database compounds including 30,000 open
unrestricted compounds. Because of the large number of agents
with data available (>30,000), a large number of spurious
associations is expected. To begin reducing this complexity, we
initially focused on the 170 standard compound databases. Using

Bonferroni-adjusted P values, we find f70 significant correlation
(Table 2), some of these can be explained by tissue-specific
methylation and drug sensitivity; for example, aberrant methylation of p15INK4b was found in 60% of leukemia cell lines (among six
leukemia cell lines, three are methylated, two are not methylated,
and one has homozygous deletion) and correlated with sensitivity
to antileukemia drug. Other associations, however, were true across
tissues and were of interest, such as correlation between CDH1
methylation and sensitivity to BCNU (R = 0.6, P < 0.00001) and
methylation of GSTP1 and sensitivity to tamoxifen (R = 0.47,
P = 0.0002). Interestingly, we also found that methylation at
multiple genes (THBS1, p15INK4b , and COX2) was significantly
correlated with resistance to pentamethylmelamine (R = 0.46,
P = 0.0003 for THBS; R = 0.60, P = 0.000001 for p15INK4b and
R = 0.60, P = 0.000001 for COX2).
Because any spurious correlations between methylation and
drug sensitivity would not be explained mechanistically by effects
on pathways that alter sensitivity to whole classes of agents, we
therefore looked at correlations between methylation and sensitivity for groups of drugs based on their mechanisms of action. A
subset of 118 compounds were classified into five groups: group 1,
alkylating agents including A2, A7, and A6, alkylating at the N 2, N 7,
and O 6 position of guanine, respectively; group 2, DNA synthesis

inhibitors; group 3, tubulin-active antimitotic agents, group 4,
topoisomerase I inhibitors; and group 5, topoisomerase II inhibitors.
Based on GI50, we defined drug activity for each agent in each cell
line as sensitive, intermediate, and resistant (detailed in Materials
and Methods). For each class of agents, cell lines were classified into
sensitive cell line if the majority of agents were sensitive in that cell
line, or resistant cell line if the majority of agents were resistant in
that cell line. Methylation of each CpG islands was then compared
with drug activity profiles in each of these five groups. The most
striking association was between p73 hypermethylation and
increased sensitivity to alkylating agents in general (Fig. 2). Out of
17 cell lines with p73 methylation, 15 (88%) were generally sensitive
to alkylating agents; in contrast, out of 41 cell lines with no p73
methylation, only 16 cell lines (39%) were sensitive to alkylating
agents (P < 0.01 by m2 test). No association was found between p73
methylation with the sensitivity to topoisomerase I or II inhibitor or
to tubulin-active antimitotic agents.
To ask whether there is a direct relation between p73 hypermethylation and associated silencing with increased sensitivity to
alkylating agents, we transfected p73 siRNA targeting the TA
promoter or scrambled siRNA to two renal cancer cell lines TK10
and 786-0. As shown in Fig. 1, p73 was methylated and weakly
expressed in parental 786-0, whereas in parental TK10 p73 was not

their Web site (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/dtpstandard/dwindex/index.jsp). Each data set was independently generated from various numbers of repeated tests, and we used
both of them for the analysis.

methylated and expressed well. Transfection of p73 siRNA but not
scrambled siRNA significantly decreased p73 expression in TK10,
and reduction of p73 expression was also observed in 786-0 after
transfecting p73 siRNA, although less dramatic compared with
TK10 (Fig. 3A). Next, we selected cisplatin as the treatment drug
because it is the most commonly used alkylating agent for cancer
treatment. Compared with 786-0, TK10 is more resistant to cisplatin; the GI50 for cisplatin is 1 Amol/L for 786-0 and 12.5 Amol/L
for TK10. We found that down-regulating p73 expression increased
the sensitivity to cisplatin in both TK10 and 786-0 cells, but such an
effect was not found in control scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3B). The
effect of increased sensitivity was more dramatic in p73-expressing
TK10 cells (GI50 decreased from 12.5 to 2.5 Amol/L f5-fold),
compared with the weakly expressing 786-0 cells.
To confirm these results, we used another approach by designing
a retroviral vector encoding shRNA that specifically targets the p73
TA promoter and infected this vector into the resistant melanoma
cell line, SK-MEL28. Down-regulation of p73 expression at both
mRNA and protein levels was found in the cells infected with this
vector but not in cells infected with the control vector, and the
effect of reduction was very similar in multiple clones we analyzed
as well as bulk cells (Fig. 4A and B). Consistent with the previous
results, we found that p73 down-regulation also significantly
increased the sensitivity to cisplatin in SK-MEL28 cells (GI50
decreased from 5 to 1.5 Amol/L, up to 4-fold, in Fig. 4C), and the
increased sensitivity was associated with an increased apoptosis
(Fig. 4D). We also tested two other alkylating agents, BCNU and
carboplatin, and observed similar results of increased sensitivity in
the cells after knockdown of p73 (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
The NCI has developed a panel of human cancer cell lines (NCI60) as a drug discovery tool by profiling sensitivity to a broad range
of chemical compounds. As an initial step to identify epigeneticmediated drug sensitivity or resistance (pharmaco-epigenomics),
we have determined DNA methylation status of 32 CpG islands in
this panel of untreated cells and provided a database that can be

www.aacrjournals.org

correlated with drug responses (sensitivity or resistance) for
>30,000 compounds tested.
By focusing on standard anticancer drugs whose mechanisms of
action are known, we identified a list of significant correlations
between gene methylation and drug sensitivity. Although most of
them seem to be tissue-type specific, there are several associations
that were present in multiple tumor types, such as methylation of
CDH1 predicts sensitivity to BCNU and methylation of GSTP1
predict sensitivity to tamoxifen. CDH1 is a major epithelial cell-cell
adhesion molecule that functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a
causative role in tumor invasion and metastasis (37). GSTP1 is a
member of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily that catalyzes
the conjugation of the peptide glutathione with electrophilic
compounds, resulting in less toxic and more readily excreted
metabolites (38). Loss of function of these genes through DNA
methylation at promoter CpG islands has been reported in both
cancer cell lines and primary cancer patients; hypermethylation of
CDH1 has been found in multiple tumors, including brain, breast,
and gastric cancers (39–41); and hypermethylation of GSTP1 is a
frequent event in prostate and breast cancers (23, 42). Interestingly,
we also observed several significant correlations between methylation of THBS1, p15INK4b , and COX2 genes with resistance to
pentamethylmelamine, an agent that alkylates DNA and forms DNA
intrastrand and DNA-protein cross-links to prevent DNA replication. It would be worth to further validate these genes in the future.
Our findings also raise the possibility that these epigenetic markers
can be used to assist in selection of therapy for individual patients
rather than the current empirical decision-making process. These
hypotheses, however, need to be tested in the setting of clinical trials.
Next, we correlated methylation profiling with groups of drugs
based on their mechanism of action, and identified a significant
association between p73 methylation and sensitivity to alkylating
agents. We further confirmed the functional link between p73 and
drug sensitivity by showing that down-regulation of p73 increases
sensitivity to commonly used alkylating agents, including cisplatin,
in several cancer cell lines tested. p73, as a TP53 homologue, is
located on chromosome 1p, a region frequently showing loss
of heterozygosity in primary cancers. Interestingly, it has been

reported that allelic loss of chromosome 1p predicts chemosensitivity in patients with oligodendroglial neoplasms (43).
Functionally, p73 has been associated with DNA damage response
by regulating programmed cell death (44), mismatch repair (45),
and transcriptional regulation (46, 47). However, p73 shows much
greater functional complexity than p53 due to the alternative
promoter usage and differential mRNA splicing (48). At least 13
different protein isoforms have been reported for p73. Overexpression of TAp73 mRNA is commonly observed in primary
human tumors, including neuroblastoma, bladder, hepatocellular,
colorectal, lung, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers, and
associated with increased expression of many genes, including
members of the NER and MMR pathways (48, 49). In cancers, it has
been suggested that inactivation of p73 in cancer cell lines by siRNA
or dominant negative mutation resulted drug resistance to cisplatin
through reduced apoptosis (36). However, our results indicate that
methylation of p73 leads to loss of gene expression and results in
sensitivity to alkylating agents in NCI-60 cancer cell lines. Moreover,
down-regulating the expression of p73 in resistant cell lines by
siRNA targeting of the same region as in the previous report (36)
can sensitize the resistant cells to cisplatin. Interestingly, we found
that the increased sensitivity to cisplatin in cells transfected with
p73 shRNA was associated with increased apoptosis. One possible
explanation is that the previous reports mainly focused on drug
resistance of cisplatin in certain types of cancers (such as colon),
whereas our study focused on p73 methylation in a panel of cancer
cells derived from different tissues and analyzed the drug sensitivity
to alkylating agents in general. It will be interesting to determine
whether p73 overexpression could lead to chemoresistance in the
cancer cells that are sensitive to alkylating agents. Previous studies
had implicated epigenetic inactivation of MGMT and sensitivity to
alkylating agents in glioma patients treated with BCNU (11). Here,
we did not find that MGMT methylation had a general predictive
significance to alkylating agents. However, there was an association

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

between MGMT methylation and sensitivity to BCNU (R = 0.324,
P = 0.01), which is consistent with the published data. In addition,
our results show that CDH1 methylation predicts sensitivity to
BCNU (R = 0.59, P = 0.000001) and p73 methylation predicts
sensitivity to alkylating agents in general. It may be worth testing
these markers in the same patient populations.
Previous studies in drug sensitivity investigated gene-drug
correlation by transcription profiling (3, 32). By correlating DNA
methylation with microarray expression analysis, we found that
promoter methylation correlated with gene expression by microarray for most cases; however, unlike gene expression–based
approaches that rely on differential expression levels of transcripts,
epigenetic profiling such as DNA methylation analysis allows us
to distinguish silenced states (accompanied by DNA methylation)
from physiologic (or transient) decreased expression. In addition,
epigenetic profiling is useful for genes with low baseline expression
and genes with multiple alternate transcripts, two situations that are
problematic in gene expression profiling. Although the candidate
epigenetic markers identified in this study must be confirmed on a
larger series of clinical patient studies, our results nonetheless
suggest that it is feasible to predict chemotherapeutic responses by
DNA methylation profiling, and future studies, including unbiased
methods for DNA methylation analysis such as high-throughput
methylation analysis and methylation microarray, will be needed to
achieve a comprehensive study of pharmaco-epigenomics.
