Components of the Leukemic Clone

Abstract
Nm23-H1 plays complex roles in the development of diverse cancers including breast carcinoma, high-grade
lymphomas, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the case of AML and lymphomas, serum Nm23-H1 protein is
elevated with the highest levels correlating with poorest prognosis. A recent study identified that this association
is most likely causal in AML and that Nm23-H1 acts as an AML cell survival factor. In this study, we report
heterogeneity in the ability of AML samples to bind and respond to Nm23-H1, and we offer evidence that binding
is essential for improved survival. Further, we show that the subset of AMLs that bind Nm23-H1 do not do so
through the putative Nm23-H1 receptor MUC1*. Although rNm23-H1 promoted the survival of the most
primitive blasts within responding AMLs, it was not these cells that actually bound the protein. Instead, rNm23H1 bound to more mature CD34lo/CD34 and CD11bþ cells, revealing an indirect survival benefit of Nm23-H1 on
primitive blasts. In support of this finding, the survival of purified blast cells was enhanced by medium
conditioned by more mature cells from the clone that had been stimulated by rNm23-H1. Levels of interleukin 1b
(IL1b) and IL6 in rNm23-H1 conditioned medium mirrored the potency of the conditioned media to promote
blast cell survival. Furthermore, Nm23-H1 expression was significantly associated with IL1b and IL6 expression
in primary uncultured AML samples. These findings have implications for the role of Nm23-H1 in AML and its
use as a prognostic marker. Additionally, they offer the first evidence of novel cross-talk between cell populations
within the tumor clone. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1177–86. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
A murine Nm23 gene identified by Steeg and colleagues (1)
was the first metastasis suppressor gene discovered. The
authors showed that high levels of Nm23 mRNA correlated
with low metastatic potential, whereas highly metastatic cells
expressed Nm23 mRNA at a lower level (1). Subsequently, 10
human Nm23 genes have been identified, which all share
functionally diverse isoforms of a nucleoside diphosphate
kinase domain (2). The Nm23-H1 and -H2 genes have been
extensively studied in human breast carcinomas, melanomas,
and ovarian cancers, where the general trend is an inverse

relationship between Nm23 expression and metastatic stage
(3). This has been supported by transfection experiments in
breast cancer MDA cell lines, where overexpression of Nm23H1 and -H2 genes resulted in decreased metastatic potential
(4–6).
In contrast, elevated Nm23-H1 expression is related to a
more aggressive disease in neuroblastomas and many hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
high-grade lymphoma, Nm23-H1 and -H2 are often overexpressed and correlate with patient white cell count, and
decreased overall patient survival (7–9). Nm23-H1 and -H2
are highly expressed in normal CD34þ hemopoietic progenitors, but are downregulated during normal hemopoietic
maturation (10). Similarly, studies in cell lines have shown
that Nm23-H1 expression decreases during induced differentiation (11). This suggests an important role for Nm23-H1 and
-H2 in controlling hemopoietic differentiation and leukemic
progression.
Extracellular Nm23-H1 has been reported to control differentiation in later stages of normal hemopoiesis and inhibit the
induced differentiation of myeloid cell lines (12–15). These
observations are significant because Nm23-H1 levels are elevated in the serum of AML patients, where levels can reach up
to 200 ng/mL levels 25-50 times those found in normal
individuals (16). Furthermore, patients with high levels of

serum Nm23-H1 have significantly lower survival rates than
those with low serum levels (16). Recently it has been shown
that recombinant Nm23-H1 (rNm23-H1) supports the growth
and survival of primary AML cells, indicating a role for
extracellular Nm23-H1 in exacerbating the tumor burden
(17). The authors showed that the prosurvival activity of
Nm23-H1 was associated with activation of p38 mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK) and STAT pathways, and
the release of a number of supportive cytokines including
granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
interleukin 1b (IL1b), and IL6.
The mechanisms by which extracellular Nm23 proteins
activate the survival pathways remains unclear. In one study
in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), more than 20% of cells
were positive for Nm23-H1 cell surface expression in more
than 25% of cases (18). The authors went on to show that NHL
patients with high Nm23-H1 cell surface expression had
significantly reduced survival rates. Weak Nm23-H1 surface
expression has been reported on some myeloid and erythroid
cell lines (10, 19) whereas to date no surface Nm23-H1
expression has been detected on normal peripheral blood
cells (10). These data suggest that extracellular Nm23 proteins
may provide an advantageous autocrine signal to malignant
cells by binding cell surface receptors; however, Nm23-H1 cell
surface binding on primary AML cells has not been investigated in detail.
Recent evidence suggests that Nm23-H1 can bind a cleaved
form of Mucin1 called MUC1*, which is present on the surface
of many cancer cell lines and on pluripotent stem cells (20, 21).
The binding of Nm23-H1 to MUC1* was reported to result in
dimerization of MUC1*, and subsequent activation of the
MAPK pathway to increase proliferation of the breast cancer
cell line T47D (20). Expression of MUC1* in the hematologic
system and AML is poorly understood.
This study investigated the binding of rNm23-H1 to AML
cells, and how binding relates to both their in vitro survival,
and the expression of MUC1*. In particular, the effects of
Nm23-H1 on more immature and mature components of the
leukemic clone was studied. Importantly, we show that not all
AMLs bind Nm23-H1. Surprisingly, in the binding cohort,
Nm23-H1 only bound a more mature subpopulation within
the clone, causing an indirect signal for the survival of the
primitive blasts cells.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant Nm23-H1
The Nm23-H1 protein coding region was cloned into the
pET-15b 6His-tag expression vector, and transformed into
Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Bacterial cultures grown to
an OD600 of 0.6 were induced to produce recombinant Nm23H1 with 1 mmol/L isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
for 4 hours. Recombinant Nm23-H1 protein was purified
from bacterial lysates using the Bugbuster NI-NTA His*Bind
Purification kit (Novagen) according to manufacturer's
instructions. The purity of Nm23-H1 protein was assessed
by coomassie stain and Western blotting of SDS-PAGE
gels.

Cell culture
K562 and NB4 cells were obtained directly from the ATCC
cell bank, which perform cell line characterization using short
tandem repeat profiling, karyotyping, and by checking cell
morphology. The cell lines were resuscitated, stored in multiple vials, and cultured for a maximum of 4 months. T47D cells
were a kind gift from Dr. Moray Campbell (Department of
Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY), who acquired them directly from ATCC and
were tested and treated as described earlier. Cells were
maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI
1640 medium with 2 mmol/L glutamine, supplemented with
100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FBS
(Gibco, Invitrogen Ltd.).
Primary AML mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll
Paque-Plus (Amersham) from presentation aspirates and
peripheral blood samples provided after informed consent
and ethical committee approval from ongoing phase I/II trials
currently undertaken within the University of Birmingham
Hospitals NHS Trust and from the Medical Research Council
(MRC) AML 15 phase III trial. AML cells were cultured at
1106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mmol/L glutamine (Gibco), supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/
mL streptomycin, and 1% serum replacement ITSþ (Becton
Dickinson). Where stated, cultures were supplemented with
Polymyxin B (Sigma) at a previously optimized concentration
of 1.25 mg/mL (22), to inhibit contaminating lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the rNm23-H1 protein preparations.
Nm23-H1 AML cell survival assay
Primary AML cell cultures were seeded at 2105 cells/well
in 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 ITSþ medium supplemented
with rNm23-H1 protein at a final concentration of 2 mg/mL, or
elution buffer control diluted to the same extent. Cells were
incubated for 5 days before analyzing survival by viable cell
counts. The Nm23-H1 survival index was calculated as the
number of viable cells treated with Nm23-H1 divided by the
number of cells treated with elution buffer control.
Flow cytometric analysis of rNm23-H1 binding to
AML cells
A modified version of the method developed by Okabe-Kado
and colleagues (19) was used. AML cells (1106) were washed
in 1 mL cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 100 mL PBS
containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and either 1%
mouse anti–Nm23-H1 antibody (GeneTEX) or its isotype
control, and incubated at 4 C for 20 minutes. Cells were
washed with 1 mL cold PBS and resuspended in 100 mL
PBS containing 1% BSA and 1% anti-mouse immunoglobulin
G fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody
(Jackson Immunoresearch), and incubated at 4 C for 20
minutes. To assess surface Nm23-H1 binding to subpopulations, cells were resuspended in 100 mL PBS containing 1%
BSA and 1% anti-CD34 allophycocyanin (APC) and CD11b
phycoerythrin (PE) antibodies (Becton Dickinson) and incubated at 4 C for 20 minutes. The cells were washed in cold PBS
and resuspended in 200 mL FACS fix [2% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v)
formaldehyde in PBS].

Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from cell pellets (1106 cells) by
boiling in 1SDS gel loading buffer [3.7 mL dH20, 15.625
mmol/L Tris-HCL pH6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) SDS,
0.125 mL 2-bME, bromophenol blue]. Lysates were resolved
on 7.5% or 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels, before transfer
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore).
Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% (w/v) nonfat
milk powder (Marvel) in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) and probed overnight in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in
TBS-T with anti-MUC1 antibodies, Ab-5 (anti-hamster,
1:1,000; Lab Vision), and VU4H5 (anti-mouse, 1:500; Santa
Cruz). Membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T and
probed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-hamster (Sigma) or anti-mouse (Sigma) secondary antibodies
diluted 1:1,000 in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in TBS-T. The
membranes were washed 3 times before detection with
Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).
Equal loading was checked using an anti–b-actin antibody
(1:25,000; Sigma) for 45 minutes, and an anti-mouse secondary (1:25,000; Sigma) for 45 minutes and was developed as
described earlier.
CD34/CD117 cell sorting
Mononuclear cells isolated from AML/RAEB2 patients were
sorted in to immature (CD34þ and/or CD117þ) and more
mature (CD34 and/or CD117) fractions using CD34 or
CD117 MACs sorting kits (Miltenyi) according to manufacturer's instructions. CD34þ/CD117þ cells were stored at
4 C overnight in RPMI 1640 ITSþ medium, whereas the
CD34/CD117 cells were seeded at 5105 cells/well in a
48-well plate in RPMI 1640 ITSþ medium supplemented with
either 2 mg/mL rNm23-H1 or elution buffer control. Cells were
cultured for 20 hours, after which the resulting conditioned
medium (CM) was removed.
Nm23-H1 depletion from CD34/CD117 conditioned
medium
Nickel resin (Sigma; 100 mL/mL of CM), was washed in
dH20, followed by a wash with equilibration buffer (50 mmol/L
sodium phosphate pH 8, 0.3 mol/L sodium chloride, 10 mmol/
L imidazole), and then 1 mL of CD34/CD117 CM was added.
The CM and resin were mixed at 4 C for 20 minutes to remove
rNm23-H1. The CM/resin was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15
seconds and CM was removed, followed by a longer centrifugation step of 2 minutes to remove any residual nickel resin
from the CM. rNm23-H1 depletion from the CM was checked
by Western blot.
Culture of CD34þ/CD117þ blast cells in CM
The previously stored CD34þ/CD117þ cells were resuspended at 1106 per mL in the CD34/CD117 CM, and
seeded at 2105 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Cell survival was
analyzed by viable cell counts after 2 days in culture.
Cytokine analysis of the CD34/CD117 cell CM
CM from the CD34/CD117 cells, stimulated with rNm23H1 or elution buffer control was analyzed for cytokine release

using a Bio-Plex Pro cytokine assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).
Culture of CD34þ blast cells with IL1b and IL6
The previously stored CD34þ cells were seeded at 2105 per
well in a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 ITSþ medium supplemented with 2 mg/mL Nm23-H1, 2.5 ng/mL IL1b, and/or 5 ng/
mL IL6. Cell survival was analyzed by viable cell counts after
2 days in culture.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Mucin1 mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative
real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) in T47D, K562, NB4, and primary
AML cells. Gene-specific primers (Sigma Genosys) and TaqMan probes (Eurogentec) were designed using Primer Express
ABI PRISM software (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of
the primers and probes were as follows:
Mucin1: forward primer 50 -TGGCCATTGTCTATCTCATTGC-30 ; reverse primer 50 -CCAGCTGCCCGTAGTTCTTT-30 ;
probe 50 -6-FAM-TTGGCTGTCTGTCAGTGGCGCC-TAMRA1-30 . 18s: forward 5 0 -GCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCTTG-3 0 ;
reverse 50 -CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-30 ; probe 50 -VICTCTGGTCCGTCTTGCGCCGG-TAMRA-30 .
QRT-PCR reactions (20 mL) were set up in triplicate containing; 1qPCR master mix (Eurogentec), 20 to 40 ng cDNA, 18
pmoles of each primer, and 2.5 pmoles of probe. QRT-PCR was
performed using standard cycle conditions on an ABI PRISM
7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems).
IL1b and IL6 mRNA expression was investigated in high
(uppermost 20%) and low (lowermost 20%) Nm23-H1–expressing AMLs out of 100 AML samples. Preoptimized Quantitect
IL1b and IL6 primers (QIAGEN) were used in a standard SYBR
green QRT-PCR assay (Quantace). QRT-PCR reactions (25 mL)
were set up in duplicate containing; 1Sensimix, 20 to 40 ng
cDNA, 9 pmoles each primer, 1SYBR-Green solution, 4
mmol/L MgCl2 and 0.5 units uracil n-glycosylase. The IL1b
and Nm23-H1 relationship was investigated in more detail by
SYBR green QRT-PCR in all the 100 AML samples.

Results
Exogenous rNm23-H1 supports the survival of AML cells
Recent data suggest that extracellular Nm23-H1 acts to
support AML cell survival (17). To further examine the role of
extracellular Nm23-H1 in AML, primary AML cells from 18
patients were cultured in serum-free conditions with and
without 2 mg/mL rNm23-H1 and cell survival analyzed at
day 5. rNm23-H1 enhanced overall AML cell survival compared with elution buffer control (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A). However,
the responses were variable with potent survival effects on
some samples and little effect on others. In 3 samples, the
response resulted in a modest increase in total cell number
over 5 days. In one of these samples, enough cells were
available to perform rNm23-H1 dose titration experiments
that showed that the effect of rNm23-H1 was significant and
near maximal at 0.25 mg/mL (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometry confirmed that leukemic blasts, as defined by CD34/CD117 positivity, were protected by rNm23-H1 (Fig. 1C). These

Figure 1. Exogenous Nm23-H1 supports the survival of AML cells. AML
cells were plated out at 1106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 ITSþ medium. A, cell
survival was analyzed after 5 days in culture with rNm23-H1 or elution
buffer (EB) only. The dotted lines show the survival of 18 AML samples
(patients 1–18, Supplementary Table 1), whereas the solid line indicates
mean survival (P < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank test). B, rNm23-H1 titration
on a single AML sample (patient 1, Supplementary Table 1). The effect of
Nm23-H1 was near maximal at 250 mg/mL (P ¼ 0.005; n ¼ 3, paired t test).
C, AML cell phenotype was assessed by staining cells with anti-CD117 PE
and anti-CD34 APC and flow cytometry (patient 19, Supplementary
Table 1). CD117 and CD34 staining (2 top dotplots) was assessed on
viable cells identified using a viable cell gate region 1 (R1; 2 bottom
dotplots).

observations support the recent findings of Okabe-Kado and
colleagues (17) that Nm23-H1 has cytoprotective effects
against AML cells at concentrations that are commensurate
with those that occur in patients’ serum, and which are
potentially considerably lower than those in the interstitial
spaces in the malignant bone marrow.
rNm23-H1 supports the survival of AMLs that bind
Nm23-H1 at the cell surface
To investigate the mechanism by which extracellular
rNm23-H1 acts to promote AML cell survival, AML cell surface
Nm23-H1 binding was measured by flow cytometry after 5 days
in culture in the presence or absence of rNm23-H1. Interest-

ingly, endogenous cell surface Nm23-H1 could be detected
already bound to 9 of 16 AML cases tested without the
addition of exogenous recombinant protein. For these 9 cases,
the addition of rNm23-H1 in culture resulted in an increase in
cell surface Nm23-H1 expression (Fig. 2A). In 8 of the 9 Nm23H1–binding AMLs, the survival response to rNm23-H1 was
greater than 1.5-fold with a mean survival index across all 9 of
1.78  0.17 (Fig. 2B). However, rNm23-H1 had little effect on
AMLs that did not bind Nm23-H1 at the cell surface (mean
survival index 1.15  0.08). The rNm23-H1–mediated increase
in cell survival among binders compared with nonbinders was
significant (P ¼ 0.004).
Mucin1 and MUC1* expression in AML
The above data reveal that not all AMLs bind either
endogenous Nm23-H1 or exogenously added rNm23-H1 and
that the survival activity exerted by extracellular Nm23-H1
requires surface binding of the protein. Recently it has been
reported that MUC1*, a truncated enzymatically cleaved form
of Mucin1, is a receptor for Nm23-H1 (20). To investigate the
possibility that MUC1* was mediating the prosurvival effects
of Nm23-H1 on AML cells, MUC1* and Mucin1 expression was
investigated in AML. In Western blotting experiments, neither
Mucin1 nor MUC1* was detected in Nm23-H1 binding or
nonbinding primary AML samples or in the AML cell line NB4.
In contrast, MUC1* was readily observed in the chronic
myeloid leukemia–derived line K562 and, as previously
described (20), both Mucin1 and MUC1* were readily detected
in the breast cancer cell line T47D (Fig. 3A). QRT-PCR analyses
confirmed very low or absent expression of Mucin1 transcripts
in both primary AMLs (n ¼ 6) and NB4 cells when compared
with T47D and K562 cells (Fig. 3B).
rNm23-H1 preferentially binds a population of more
mature CD34lo/CD11bþ cells within the AML clone
To identify the population of AML cells binding Nm23-H1,
cell surface Nm23-H1 binding was studied by flow cytometry
in combination with expression of myeloid markers CD34 and
CD11b. Figure 4 reveals that both endogenous and recombinant Nm23-H1 preferentially bound populations of CD34lo/
CD11bþ cells rather than the more immature and more
strongly CD34þ cells. The forward and side scatter plots show
that these cells are larger and more granular than the AML
blasts, indicative of a more mature phenotype. However,
despite rNm23-H1 binding a discrete subpopulation of more
mature cells, the survival of both the immature and more
mature cell populations was enhanced by the addition of
rNm23-H1 in culture (Fig. 4).
Nm23-H1 supports the indirect survival of immature
AML blast cells
The observation that Nm23-H1 was binding a population of
CD34lo/CD11bþ cells while enhancing the survival of more
immature CD34þ cells indicated an indirect survival effect on
the more primitive members of the malignant clone. To
investigate this further, cells from 5 AML patients were sorted
into immature CD34þ and more mature CD34lo/ fractions. In
addition, an RAEB2 patient sample was sorted into more

Figure 2. Nm23-H1 supports the survival of AMLs that bind Nm23-H1 at the cell surface. AML cells were plated out at 1106 cells/mL in RPMI
1640 ITSþ medium, with rNm23-H1 or elution buffer only. A, after 5 days in culture, Nm23-H1 cell surface binding was measured using an
anti–Nm23-H1 antibody and flow cytometry. Representative histograms of an Nm23-H1 nonbinding and binding AML (patient 4 and 2, respectively,
Supplementary Table 1) are shown. Isotype control, solid gray histograms; elution buffer–treated cells, gray line histograms; rNm23-H1–treated cells,

buffer–treated cells after 5 days in culture. The difference in survival index in response to rNm23-H1 was compared between binding (n ¼ 9)
and nonbinding AMLs (n ¼ 7; patients 1–16, Supplementary Table 1); P ¼ 0.004 (Mann–Whitney U test).

immature and mature fractions using sorting for CD117þ
immature cells. The more mature CD34 (AML) and
CD117 (RAEB2) fractions were cultured in the presence or
absence of 2 mg/mL rNm23-H1 for 20 hours, after which the
resulting CM was harvested and depleted of rNm23-H1 using
nickel resin (Fig. 5A). The CM from elution buffer controltreated cells was mock depleted of rNm23-H1 in the same way
as the CM from the rNm23-H1 cells. Subsequently, the immature CD34þ or CD117þ cells, which had been stored at 4 C
overnight, were cultured in these CM, and cell survival analyzed after 2 days in culture. In 5 of 6 cases, the survival of
immature CD34þ or CD117þ blast cells was enhanced by CM
from rNm23-H1–stimulated CD34/CD117 cells, but not by
CM from elution buffer–treated CD34/CD117 cells
(Fig. 5C). Notably, in the sixth case, where no survival advantage was observed, we failed to detect binding of rNm23-H to

the CD34lo/ cells. Further, incubation of purified immature
CD34þ/CD17þ AML blasts with rNm23-H1 alone did not
provide a survival advantage (data not shown). A possible
explanation for these findings would be a survival effect
triggered by the contamination of our rNm23-H1 with LPS
derived from the bacteria in which the protein was generated.
However, this was not the case because the addition of the LPS
inhibitor polymyxin B to CD34/CD117 cell culture had no
significant effect on rNm23-H1–mediated indirect CD34þ/
CD117þ cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 1).
rNm23-H1–induced release of IL1b and IL6 from
CD34/CD117 cells promotes the survival of immature
CD34þ/CD117þ blast cells
The above observations strongly indicate that rNm23-H1
promoted the survival of AML blasts via binding to more

Figure 5. Nm23-H1 supports the indirect survival of immature AML blast

Nm23-H1 it was necessary to efficiently deplete the protein from the CM. A
representative Western blot of CD34/CD117 CM pre- and post–rNm23H1 depletion is shown (patient 21, Supplementary Table 1). However, this
test was done on all experiments. B, AML cells were sorted for CD34/
CD117 and CD34þ/CD117þ cells using CD34 or CD117 MACs sorting
kits. CD34/CD117-purified AML cells were treated with either elution
buffer control or 2 mg/mL rNm23-HI for 20 hours. Viable cell numbers were
counted following 2-day treatments of the more immature CD34þ/CD117þ
AML cells with CM from elution buffer–treated CD34/CD117 cells (CM

These assays used CM taken from CD34/CD117 cells from 3
AML samples and 1 RAEB2 sample. The CD34þ or CD17þ cells
from these samples had shown a range of survival responses to
rNm23-H1 CM (Fig. 6A). Exposure of CD34/CD117 to
rNm23-H1 resulted in multiple and variable changes in cytokine release across the 4 samples (Supplementary Table 1).
However, rNm23-H1 consistently stimulated CD34 or
CD117 cells to release IL1b and IL6 at levels that mirrored
the potency of the CM to promote the survival of CD34þ or
CD117þ blast cells from the same samples (Fig. 6A–C).
The above observations suggest an association between the
Nm23-H1–induced release of IL1b and IL6 from
CD34/CD117 cells and the promoted survival of immature
blast cells. To investigate this association further, CD34þ cells
from 3 AML patients were cultured with rIL1b and/or rIL6
(Fig. 6D and E). In all 3 cases tested, the direct addition of
rIL1b and/or IL6 recapitulated the survival effects of the
medium conditioned by Nm23-H1–stimulated CD34/
CD117 cells.
The relationship between Nm23-H1 expression and IL1b
and IL6 mRNA expression in vivo
As rNm23-H1 stimulated the release of IL1b and IL6 in vitro,
we wished to seek evidence that endogenous expression of
Nm23-H1 by AML cells was correlated with expression of IL1b
and IL6 in vivo. Nm23-H1 levels were measured in 100 primary
AML samples using QRT-PCR, and IL1b and IL6 expression
measured in the 20 samples that displayed the highest and
lowest expression of Nm23-H1. Median IL1b and IL6 expression in the uppermost 20% of Nm23-H1–expressing AMLs was
12-fold and 5-fold higher, respectively, compared with the
lowest 20% of Nm23-H1–expressing AMLs (Fig. 7A and B;
P < 0.001 and P ¼ 0.004, respectively). A highly significant
correlation between IL1b and Nm23-H1 mRNA expression

Discussion
In this study, we show a strong association between the
ability of the AML cells to bind rNm23-H1 at the cell surface
and cell survival in vitro. Cell surface Nm23-H1 has been
previously observed on NHL cells (18) and some myeloid cell
lines (10, 19). However, to our knowledge, this is the first time
that binding of Nm23-H1 to AML cells from an exogenous
soluble pool of protein, commensurate with that found in
AML patients, has been shown. Importantly, not all AML
samples bound either endogenous Nm23-H1 or exogenously
added rNm23-H1. This has notable implications for the biology of the disease. It has been previously documented that
expression of Nm23-H1 transcripts, and more so levels of

Nm23-H1 protein in serum, provide strong indicators of
prognosis with higher values associating with poorer overall
survival (7, 16). The data of Okabe-Kado and colleagues (17)
and our observations here strongly indicate that Nm23-H1 can
act as a tumor-derived survival factor in AML, and therefore
that these associations with prognosis are causal. However,
the influence of this mechanism on patient outcome is likely
to have been underestimated because earlier studies were not
able to delineate between Nm23-H1 binding AMLs in which
the mechanism is likely to be active, from nonbinders in which
Nm23-H1 levels are less likely to be of importance. Our data
also imply that some AMLs express an Nm23-H1 receptor
whereas others do not.
A previous study in T47D breast cancer cells identified
MUC1* as a potential Nm23-H1 receptor (20). Mahanta and
colleagues used extracellular MUC1* amino acids as bait to
"fish" for possible dimerizing ligands in the T47D CM. A

Figure 7. The relationship between Nm23-H1, IL1b, and IL6 mRNA expression in vivo. Nm23-H1 mRNA expression was measured by QRT-PCR
in RNA samples from the MRC-AML12 bank. Relative ILb and IL6 expression was normalized to the median expression of each cytokine. A, high
Nm23-H1 mRNA-expressing AMLs express relatively high mRNA levels of IL1b (median 283.2) compared with low Nm23-H1 mRNA-expressing AMLs
(median 23.5; P < 0.001). B, high Nm23-H1 mRNA-expressing AMLs express relatively high mRNA levels of IL6 (median 247.2) compared with low
Nm23-H1 mRNA-expressing AMLs (median 55.2; P ¼ 0.004). Differences between groups were analyzed by a Mann–Whitney U test (n ¼ 40). C,

dimerizing ligand was found and was subsequently identified
as Nm23-H1 by immunoprecipitation (20). Furthermore, the
authors showed the capacity of MUC1* to dimerize and
activate the MAPK pathway to increase proliferation of the
T47D cells (20). A second study described that Nm23-H1
promoted growth of MUC1*–expressing pluripotent stem
cells, an activity that was recapitulated by antibody induced
dimerization of MUC1* (21). Although these studies indicate
that MUC1* can act as a receptor for Nm23-H1 we have shown
here that cell surface binding to AML cells is independent of
MUC1*, and therefore an alternative receptor must be present
on these cells. Future studies should investigate the relationship between Nm23-H1 binding and responses to AML therapies and aim to determine the nature of the Nm23-H1 receptor
in AML, which may provide a novel target for adjunctive
therapies.
Unexpectedly, our results show that Nm23-H1 preferentially
binds the more mature cells of the AML clone that are CD34lo/
CD11bþ. However, the survival of both the more mature
(CD34lo/CD11bþ) and immature (CD34þ/CD11b) cells was
enhanced. These data indicate that Nm23-H1 has indirect
survival effects on the CD34þ/CD11b cells, by inducing
supportive cytokine release from the more mature CD34lo/
CD11bþ cells.
Of the 28 cytokines measured in our assay, the release of
IL1b and IL6 from the more mature cells best correlated with
the survival of the immature cells. Furthermore, the direct
addition of IL1b and/or IL6 recapitulated the survival effects
of the CM to promote CD34þ blast cell survival. Unexpectedly,
either IL1b or IL6 was sufficient in all cases tested, with each of
the AML samples demonstrating different survival responses
to the 2 cytokines.
The promoted release of IL1b and IL6 by Nm23-H1 was also
observed by Okabe-Kado and colleagues (17). However, their
experiments used unsorted cells, and therefore did not show

1184

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

that these cytokines form part of a feedback mechanism
within the AML clone. Furthermore, we studied Nm23-H1,
IL1b and IL6 mRNA expression in freshly isolated AML mononuclear cell preparations and observed that elevated Nm23-H1
expression correlated with higher expression of IL1b and IL6.
Thus, our data are consistent with the model that Nm23-H1
regulates IL1b and IL6 expression within AML cells in vivo.
Once again our data are likely to underestimate the link
between Nm23-H1 and IL1b and IL6 expression in AML
because the RNA samples used were from the MRC-AML12
bank in which Nm23-HI binding capacity had not been
measured.
Our observations are consistent with other studies identifying the importance of IL1b in AML. Exogenous rIL1b has been
shown to enhance the proliferation of AML cells, and a strong
proliferative response in vitro to rIL1b predicts a reduced rate
of complete remission for AML patients (23, 24). Evidence also
suggests that IL1b modulates autocrine signaling by stimulating the release of growth factors such as GM-CSF from AML
blast cells (25–27). More recently rIL1b has been shown to
enhance AML cell survival by activating multiple survival
pathways, which include the p38 MAPK, phosphoinositide
3-kinase, and NF-kB pathways (28).
Although IL6 is known to be a key growth factor in multiple
myeloma (29), the role of IL6 in AML is poorly understood.
There is evidence that the addition of exogenous rIL6 synergizes with other cytokines, including GM-CSF, IL3, and IL4, to
enhance growth and survival of AML cells (30, 31). Elevated
autocrine/paracrine secretion of IL6 in AML has been shown
to constitutively activate Stat3 signaling (32), a feature associated with the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, and
cyclins that regulate G1 to S-phase cell cycle transition (33, 34).
During normal hemopoiesis Nm23-H1 is highly expressed in
immature CD34þ hemopoietic cells, and its expression
decreases during maturation (10). Thus, it is likely that the

elevated serum Nm23-H1 levels found in AML patients derive
predominantly from the more immature components of the
clone. Collectively our findings indicate that the released
Nm23-H1 is sensed by the more mature malignant cells,
improving their survival, and stimulating a reciprocal cytokine-mediated survival signal directed by the immature cells.
This novel feedback mechanism reveals that the action of
Nm23-H1 in promoting AML cell survival and clonal expansion is more complex than expected. Following the demonstration that Nm23-H1 inhibits myeloid cell differentiation
(14), it is attractive to hypothesize that this mechanism may
reflect the subversion by AML cells of a previously unidentified
process of "quorum sensing" during normal hemopoiesis that
regulates the balance between transiently amplifying and
maturating cell populations.
