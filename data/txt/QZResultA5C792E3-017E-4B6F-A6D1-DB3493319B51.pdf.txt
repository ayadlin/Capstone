ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common prevalent cancer types
worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have been demonstrated to play crucial
roles in the development, metastasis and drug resistance of CRC. In the present study,
a strikingly elevated expression of miR-552 was determined in CRC tumor tissues
and cells by a miRNA profiling analysis. Importantly, the gene of A Disintegrin And
Metalloprotease (ADAM) family member 28 (ADAM28) was identified as a target of
miR-552, which was further validated in terms of genetic dual luciferase report assay.
Furthermore, an inhibition of miR-552 in LOVE and LS174T CRC cells by transducing
miR-552 inhibitor (antagomiR-552) with a lentiviral vector exhibited an ability to
reduce cell proliferation, migration and clonogenicity. Moreover, both LOVO and
LS174T cells stably expressing miR-552 inhibitor displayed a decreased ability to
develop tumors in a murine xenograft model in vivo. In contrast, a knockdown of
ADAM28 by short hairpin RNA could reverse the antagomiR-552-induced inhibition
of metastatic features of CRC cells in vitro. These results suggested that miR-552 is
an oncomir able to promote CRC metastasis in part through a mechanism of targeting
ADAM28, which may be a novel target for CRC treatment and warrants for further
investigation.

INTRODUCTION

Indeed, recent miRNA profiling studies have demonstrated
alterations of miRNA expression in tumors compared to
paired adjacent normal tissues in CRC, which has been
proposed to correlate with the stages and metastasis
in CRC patients. In this context, miRNAs can play a
functionality of either tumor-suppressors or oncogenes
(oncomirs) through mechanisms of directly targeting
genes in the key steps of initial and metastatic processes,
as well as acquired drug-resistances [6–8].
A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) are
a new gene family of proteins that structurally classified
into two groups, the membrane-anchored ADAM [9]
and ADAM with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)
[10]. To date, 34 and 21 of ADAM family members
are respectively identified in mouse and human, these

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of 18–22 nt
small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the gene
expressions of target mRNAs at the post-transcriptional
level through a non-genetically mutational mechanism.
To date, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the
importance of miRNAs in cancer development and
progression. In this regard, the dysregulated miRNAs
have been involved in the regulation of gene function
that contributed to the initiation, growth, metastasis,
recurrence and acquisition of drug-resistance in a variety
of cancers, including the colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is
the third most common malignant neoplasm worldwide,
which accounts for 9.7% of all cancer incidences [1–5].

members are characterized with sequence similarity to
the reprolysin family of snake venomases that share the
metalloproteinase domain with matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) [11]. A compelling body of studies have indicated
that ADAM members have diverse roles in various
biological processes, such as the cell adhesion, cell fusion,
cell migration, cell proliferation and the pathogenesis
of a variety of diseases, particularly in cancers [12–14].
In this regard, the expression of many ADAM species,
including ADAM8, ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM17,
ADAM28, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 are up-regulated in
several types of human tumors involved in the regulation
of cell proliferation and malignancy, despite the precise
mechanism of their oncogenic roles remains incompletely
understood [13]. For example, ADAMTSs secreted by
cancer and stromal cells may contribute to modify tumor
microenvironments, where ADAMTSs are implicated in
the cell invasion, migration, proliferation and angiogenesis
via mechanisms involved in cleaving or interacting with
extracellular matrix components or regulatory factors [12].
Among these ADAMs, ADAM8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22,
23 and 28 have been demonstrated to play a regulatory role
in the initiation, procession and metastasis of cancers [13].
A disintegrin-metalloproteinase 28 (ADAM28)
is one of important members of ADAM family, which
consists of two isoforms, prototype membrane-type form
(ADAM28m, 775 amino acids) and short secreted form
(ADAM28s, 540 amino acids), and has been involved
in various biological events including cell adhesion
proteolysis, growth and metastasis of solid tumors and
hematological malignancies [15]. Accumulated lines
of evidence have shown that ADAM28 expression
was strikingly up-regulated in several human cancers
[16], such as non-small cell lung cancer [17–19], breast
cancer [20], bladder cancer [21] and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia [22]. In addition, its expression in cancer cells
was correlated with the metastasis of cancers [16]. For
instance, ADAM28 was the most frequent and selective
ADAM species expressing in the breast and lung
carcinoma tissues, and the abundance of its transcripts was
directly correlated with the capacity of cell proliferation
and metastasis [19, 20]. Mechanistically, the oncogenic
role of ADAM28-mediated cancer cell metastasis may
be related with its ability to cleave factors including von
Willebrand’s factor (vWF) [15], insulin-like growth factor
binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) [23], and connective tissue
growth factor (CTGF) [24], and to promote PSGL-1/Pselectin-mediated cell adhesion [25].
In the CRC, the correlation of ADAM28 and CRC
tumorigenesis has not yet been established, although
transcripts of ADAM28 and IGFBP-3 genes in fresh CRC
tumor specimens were primary examined in CRC patients
with overweight or obese using a microarray analysis
[23]. In consistent with findings in other cancer types,
the change of ADAM28 and IGFBP-3 genes expression
was only observed in normal tissues but not tumor tissues
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of overweight/obese patients with CRC, implying that
alterations of the expression of ADAM28 and IGFBP-3
may be an initial process of cancer proliferation, despite
the histopathologically normal surgical margin in this
group of patients was not equal to the molecular margin
[23]. In normal tissues, ADAM28 may play a protective
role in cell survival. For instance, a recent study
demonstrated that the ADAM28 played a role in cell
survival of bronchial epithelial cells by suppressing a C1qinduced cytotoxicity [26].
Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that
ADAMs could be regulated by miRNAs in various
cancers [27–29], and we and others have recently revealed
a strikingly up-regulated miR-552 and miR-592 in CRC
tissues as compared to the matched adjacent non-tumor
tissues, which imply the it may play a oncogenic role in CRC
tumorigenesis [30, 31] and metastasis [32, 33]. In this regard,
miR-552 was found to correlate with the clinical stage, lymph
node and distant metastases, as well as chemoresistance of
CRC [34]. By using the online computational miRNA target
prediction tool, TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org),
ADAM28 was predicted as a potential target of miR-552.
Together with the fact of that no miRNA has been reported
to target ADAM28 yet, we therefore hypothesize that the
ADAM28 might ba a target of miR-552 in CRC.

RESULTS
Evoked miR-552 and miR-592 transcripts in
human colorectal cancer
Previous miRNA microarray analysis has
demonstrated that miR-552 and miR-592 were an oncomir
and up-regulated of in CRC [30, 31, 33, 35, 36]. In order
to further validate a correlation of the expression of these
miRNAs and clinicopathologic stages in CRC, the relative
expression of miR-552 and miR-592 in CRC tumor tissues
and cell lines was evaluated by a qRT-PCR assay (Figure 1
and Table 1). In line with the previous reports from other
groups, results of this study also displayed a significantly
more abundant miR-552 and miR-592 transcripts in tumor
tissues relative to the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues
(Figure 1A and Table 1), and the expression of miR552 was also correlated with the abundance of miR-592
transcript in CRC tissues (r = 0.3568, 95% CI = 0.079–
0.583, p < 0.011, N = 50) (Figure 1B). In addition, all
examined CRC cell lines, including HCT116, LOVE,
LS174T and SW480, also showed an elevated expression
of miR-552 and miR-592 in comparison with the normal
colon epithelial cell line CCD-18Co (Figure 1C).
Particularly, LOVO and LS174T cells showed the most
and least abundance of miR-552 transcript among the
examined cell lines, respectively. Therefore they were
chosen as cell models for further investigations in this
study. Since the oncogenic role of miR-592 in CRC has
been extensively investigated [33, 35, 36], the biological

this study. Interestingly, an up-regulated miR-552 was
also correlated with the TNM stages and lymph node
metastasis in CRC (Table 1).

of many types of cancers, including the CRC, in which
ADAM28 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis
[22, 23, 37, 38], despite its role in CRC remained
unclear [23]. To further explore the clinical relevance of
ADAM28 with the clinic pathogenesis in human CRC, its
expression was first evaluated in CRC tumor tissues and
the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues by IHC staining
against anti-ADAM28 antibody. The result exhibited a
more pronounced ADAM28 protein in non-tumor tissues
(Figure 2A–2C), as compared to the matched tumor tissues
(Figure 2D–2F). This finding was further supported by
the immunoblotting assay, by which much less abundant
ADAM28 protein was detected in CRC tumor tissues
relative to the matched non-tumor tissues (Figure 2G
and 2H). Notably, the strikingly suppressed expression
of ADAM28 in CRC tumors was confirmed by a
semi-quantitative assay using a RT-PCR assay (Figure 2I)

The expression of ADAM28 is suppressed in
human colorectal cancer
In order to interrogate the biological significances
of miR-552 in the tumorigenesis of CRC, the online
computational miRNA target prediction tool, TargetScan
(http://www.targetscan.org), was used for identifying
potential targets of miR-552 (Supplementary Table S1). The
ADAM28 was screened as a potential target of miR-552
for further investigation, partially owing to a conserved
seed sequence of this miRNA was possessed within the
3′UTR of its mRNA, and its crucial role in pathogenesis

miR-552 enhances clonogenicity and
tumorigenicity of CRC cells

and a measurement of the integrated absorbance (IA)
of IHC images from twenty examined paired archival
CRC samples (p < 0.05) (Figure 2J and data not shown),
suggesting that ADAM28 may play a tumor suppressor role
in the carcinogenesis of CRC, and is an attractive potential
target for treatment of this disease [16].

To better characterize the functionality of miR-552
in CRC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, LOVO
and LS174T cells expressing miR-552 inhibitor
(antagomiR-552) were used for evaluating the impact
of miR-552 on the capacities of clonogenicity in vitro
(Figure 6) and xenograft tumorigenicity in BALB/C mice
in vivo (Figure 7). Importantly, an inhibition of miR-552
expression in CRC cells by introducing miR-552 inhibitor
exhibited a potential to significantly decrease the capacity
of clonogenesis (Figure 6) and tumorigenesis (Figure 7)
in both of LOVO and LS174T cells, as compared with
those cells infected with LV-NC (p < 0.01). These results
imply that miR-552 may play a pivotal role in governing
the stemness of colorectal cancer stem cells, suggesting
that miR-552 may be a novel target for preventing CRC.

Validation of ADAM28 mRNA as a target of
miR-552
To experimentally validate whether ADAM28 is a
potential target of miR-552 in CRC. Luciferase reporter
vector containing a 3′UTR of ADAM28 mRNA (pMIRReport/ADAM28 3′UTR), or a mutated 3′UTR (pMIRReport/Mut-ADAM28 3′UTR) were first constructed
(Figure 3A). The 293T cells were co-transfected with pMIRReport/ADAM28 3′UTR or pMIR-Report/Mut-ADAM28
3′UTR, and scramble miRNA control (NC), miR-552
mimics, or miR-552 inhibitor. The results of dual luciferase
assay showed a significant decrease of relative luciferase
activity in the cells transfected with miR-552 mimics, in
comparison with the control miRNA or inhibitor transfected
cells (Figure 3B). Immunoblotting assay further confirmed
that ADAM28 protein in the CCD-18Co cells was increased
and decreased when they were transfected with the miR-552
inhibitor and mimic, respectively; in addition, an increased
abundance of ADAM28 protein was found in both LOVO
and LS174T cells infected with the LV-miR-552-inh viral
vector as compared to the LV-NC (Figure 3C). This data
further confirmed that ADAM28 might be a potential target
for the oncomir miR-552 in CRC.

Knockdown of ADAM28 expression increases the
cell proliferation, migration and clonogenicity in
LOVO and LS174T CRC cells
In order to further examine whether the miR-552
promotes CRC cell metastasis by targeting ADAM28,
the up-regulated ADAM28 in LV-miR-552-inh
transduced LOVO and LS174T cells was knocked
down by shRNAs to ADAM28 mRNA. To this end,
LV-miR-552-inh transduced LOVO and LS174T cells
were first infected with one of LV-shADAM28-972,
LV-shADAM28-1192,
LV-shADAM28-1820
or
LV-shADAM28-1867, and the expression of ADAM28
protein was determined by an immunoblotting assay.
The result showed that all the four tested shRNA
vectors were able to reduced the expression of
ADAM28 protein at various degrees in LV-miR-552inh transduced LOVO and LS174T cells, among them
the LV-shADAM28-972 displayed the most efficient
knockdown of the targeted protein in both LOVO cells
and LS174T cells (Figure 8A). The LOVO and LS174T
CRC cells that co-infected with LV-shADAM28-972
vector and LV-miR-552-inh were employed for the study
of loss-function of ADAM28, as an infection of LV-miR552-inh resulted in an elevated ADAM28 expression
in LOVO and LS174T cells (Figure 3C). Notably, the
LV-shADAM28-972-mediated reduction of ADAM28
expression showed a significantly enhanced capacity
of cell proliferation in LV-miR-552-inh-transduced
LOVO and LS174T CRC cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 8B),
and statistically increased ability of cell migration in
LV-miR-552-inh-transduced LS174T cells (p < 0.05) but
not in the LOVO cells (p > 0.05) (Figure 8C). However,
only moderately enhanced ability clonogenicity in
both LV-shADAM28-972 co-infected LV-miR-552inh-transduced LOVO and LS174T CRC cells was
observed (p > 0.05) (Figure 8D). These data indicated

miR-552 enhances the capacity of CRC cell
migration and proliferation
Since miR-552 was up-regulated in CRC cells, in
order to explore its biological role in the development and
metastasis of CRC, lentiviral vectors expressing miR-552
inhibitor and a control scramble miRNA, lentiviral vectors
LV-miR-552-inh (antagomiR-552) and LV-NC were
produced, respectively. These viruses were used to infect
LOVO and LS174T CRC cells, or generate cell lines
stably expressing antagomiR-552 or a scramble miRNA
control (Figure 4A–4D). A significantly reduced miR-552
transcript was observed in cells infected with LV-miR552-inh, as compared with those transduced with LV-NC
vectors as determined by a qRT-PCR assay (Figure 4E).
Intriguingly, the migration capacity in both miR-552-inhtransduced LOVO and LS174T cells was significantly
reduced in comparison with those infected with LV-NC
virus, as determined using a scratch assay (p < 0.01) (Figure
5A–5B). Consistently, the proliferation of CRC cells was
also dramatically inhibited when the cells were enforced
expression of the antagomiR-552, relative to the cell
transduced with NC scramble miRNA, as determined by an
MTT method (p < 0.01) (Figure 5C).

that a knockdown of ADAM28 expression could
partially reverse the miR-552-inh-mediated inhibition
of metastatic capacity of LOVO and LS174T CRC cells
in vitro, suggesting that a oncogenic role of miR-552
in the CRC cells was in part through a mechanism by
directly targeting ADAM28 gene.

ADAM28 using shRNA was able to reverse the antagomir552-mediated inhibition of metastatic properties of CRC
cells. Mechanistically, the oncogenic role of miR-552 is
at least in part through a mechanism by directly targeting
ADAM28 mRNA.
ADAM28 is an important member of the ADAM
gene family, which shares a more homological sequence
of amino acid with snake venom metalloproteinase
(SVMPs) relative to other family members [16]. The
metalloproteinase domain of ADAM28 has the zincbinding consensus sequence, and ADAM28 exhibits
catalytic activity to a few substrates such as IGFBP-3
and vWF [15]. A pronounced expression of ADAM28
was frequently observed in human solid tumors, such as
lung cancer, breast cancer and bladder cancer [17–21].
For example, ADAM28 was overexpressed in human
breast tumor tissues, which was positively correlated
with the proliferative activity of the cancer cells.
Furthermore, an exposure of breast carcinoma cells
(MDA-MB231) to IGF-I led an enhanced capacity of
cell proliferation, cleavage of IGFBP-3 and activation

DISCUSSION
An increased numbers of evidence has suggested
that miRNAs play crucial roles in the development and
progression of human CRC. In the present study, we
identified miR-552 and miR-592 were potential oncogenes
in CRC, in which both miR-552 and miR-592 were
significantly evoked in CRC, which were correlated with
the TNM stages and lymph node metastasis of this type
of cancer. Importantly, enforced expression of miR-552
inhibitor, the antagomir-552 showed an ability to inhibit
the proliferation, migration and clonogenicity of CRC cells
in vitro, and to repress tumor growth in a xenograft tumor
model of SCID mice in vivo. In contrast, a reduction of

of IGF-I cell signaling. Importantly, these processes
could be dramatically inhibited by a treatment of antiADAM28 antibody or small interfering RNA to ADAM28,
suggesting that ADAM28 had a clinical implication
in breast cancer cell proliferation through enhanced
bioavailability of IGF-I released from the IGF-I/IGFBP-3
complex by selective IGFBP-3 cleavage [20]. With respect
to lung carcinomas, the expression of ADAM28 was also
elevated, suggesting that it may be a better serological
and immunohistochemical marker for non-small-cell lung
cancers (NSCLC) [19].
Indeed, Kuroda et al. found that the ADAM28
level in the NSCLC tissue and serum was 36.9-fold
and 4.6-fold over that in the non-neoplastic lung tissue
and serum, respectively. Intriguingly, such an evoked
expression of ADAM28 was also found in the patients
with recurrent NSCLC and/or lymph node metastasis,

and was correlated with a poor disease-free survival [19].
In asbestos-related lung adenocarcinomas, however the
expression of ADAM28 was even more elevated than nonasbestos related lung cancer adenocarcinoma [18]. Equally
noteworthy, the level of ADAM28 in sera of advanced
NSCLC patients was declined during a chemotherapeutic
process, and was significantly correlated with the
therapeutic responses and prognosis, indicating that the
serum ADAM28 may be a reliable surrogate marker for
predicting tumor response to a chemotherapeutic regimen
and the survival in patients with advanced NSCLC [17].
Mechanistically, an effect ADAM28 on cancer cell
metastasis was through by cleaving vWF as determined in
terms of assays including the yeast two-hybrid analysis,
knockdown of ADAM28 expression using shRNAs or
small interface RNA (siRNA) to ADAM28, or inhibition
of activity using neutralizing anti-ADAM28 antibody

LV-shADAM28-1192, LV-shADAM28-1820 or LV-shADAM28-1867, the expression of ADAM28 protein was determined by an
immunoblotting assay (A), and the capacity of proliferation (B), cell migration (C) and clonogenicity (D) were accessed in terms of an MTT
assay, a scratch assay, and clone formation assay, respectively. (A) Representative blots of AMAM28 expression in LOVO cells (top two

could efficiently knockdown the LV-miR-552-inh-restored ADAM28 in both LOVO and LS174T cells, which was chosen for using in
further analysis in this study. (B) An MTT assay showed a promotion of cell proliferation in LV-shADAM28-972 and LV-miR-552-inhco-infected LOVO and LS174T cells (p < 0.05). (C) Relevant quantification of the results of cell migration index showed a significantly

in a mouse tumor xenograft models [15]. In addition,
oncoprotein v-src also showed an ability to induce
ADAM28 expression in human carcinoma cell lines of
the lung, breast, ovary, kidney and colon [37]. Conversely,
in the present study, a down-regulation of ADAM28 by
miR-552 or shRNA showed enhanced metastatic
properties of CRC cells in vivo, and a stored expression
of ADAM28 protein by miR-552-inh exhibited a potential
to reduce metastatic capacity of CRC cells in vitro and
in vivo. Of great interest, the knockdown of ADAM28
could only partially restored the metastatic ability
inhibited by miR-552 inhibitor in CRC cells, suggesting
that miR-552 might promote the metastasis by targeting
ADAM28 and other signaling in CRC. In addition, the
distinct biofunctions of ADAM28 observed in various
cancer types may imply a cancer type context-dependent
biological function of ADAM28 in CRC cells, which
warrants further investigations.
In the CRC, up-regulation of ADAM28 and
IGFBP-3 genes in was only detected in the normal tissue
of overweight/obese patients with CRC as determined
by a qRT-PCR assay, but the histopathologically normal
surgical margin in specimens was not equal to the
molecular margin [23]. However, a controversial result
was reported by Abe et al., by whom a co-expression
of ADAM28 and phosphorylated v-src was found in
neoplastic cells of the breast, lung, and colon carcinomas
and some adenomas of the colon, but not in nonneoplastic
colon mucosa, as determined by an IHC analysis [37].
In the present study, lower levels of ADAM28 transcript
and protein were observed in the CRC tumor tissues
relative the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues as
examined in terms of respective qRT-PCR assay and IHC
staining analysis. This finding was in agreement with that
observed by Nowakowska-Zajdel [23]. We reason that the
discrepancy of ADAM28 expression in CRC tissues found
in different groups may be in part attributed to different
resources of anti-ADAM28 antibodies used in different
studies.
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a potential
effectiveness for suppressing tumor growth and reversing
drug resistance by targeting oncomirs using antisense
miRNAs. In this regard, miR-23a and miR-21 have gained
the most interest, owing to an aberrant expression of these
miRNAs in CRC cells. For instance, inhibition of miR-21
by antisense miR-21 (antagomir-21) promoted the
differentiation CRC HCT-116 or HT-29 cells, which was
accompanied by significant decreases of the expression
of colorectal cancer stem cell (CRSC) marker CD44,
capacity of colonosphere formation, and Wnt signaling
activity but an increase of PDCD4 expression [39].
Similarly, miR-23a was found to be elevated in 5-FU
CRC cells, and its target APAF-1 along with caspases-3
and -7 were down-regulated in these cells. Interestingly,
introduction of miR-23a antisense into 5-FU resistant cells
showed an increased level of apoptotic protease activating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

facter-1 (APAF-1), along with an enhanced activation of
caspase-3 and -7, subsequently enhanced the 5-FU induced
apoptosis in these cells [40]. By harnessing a similar
strategy, Ge et al. investigated the effect of antagomiR27a in glioblastoma [41]. As aberrant miR-21 and miR592 seen in CRC, more abundant miR-27a transcript was
detected in specimens from glioblastoma comparing with
normal human brain tissues. A transduction of antagomiR27a (miR-27a inhibitor) showed an ability to significantly
inhibit the invasion and proliferation of U87 glioblastoma
cells, and reduce the growth of glioblastoma xenograft in
SCID mice [41]. Consistent with these findings, our data
also showed that an introduction of miR-552 inhibitor
(antagomiR-552) led to a suppression of CRC cell
proliferation and migration, and a reduced capacity of CRC
cell clonogenicity and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo.
In summary, less abundant ADAM28 protein was
detected in CRC tissues and cell lines, accompanied with
an evoked miR-552 expression. The ADAM28 gene was
identified as a direct target of miR-552. Remarkably, an
inhibition of miR-552 by antagomiR-552 exhibited an ability
to reduce metastatic potentials and capacity of clonogenicity
in vitro, and decrease the ability of tumorigenicity of CRC
cells in vivo. In contrast, a knockdown of ADAM28 in CRC
cells by shRNA showed an enhanced capacity of cancer
cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Results from this
study suggest that miR-552 acts as an oncogene in CRC,
which can promotes cancer metastasis through a mechanism
in part by directly targeting ADAM28 in CRC. This study
thus offers an insight in the mechanism underpinning
the metastasis of CRC, which warranted for further
investigation as a novel target for prognosis, prevention and
treatment of this disease.

ADAM metallopeptidase domain 28 (ADAM28), transcript
variant 1, mRNA was amplified, which included a miR-552
targeting sequence ACCTGT at position of ADAM28
3′-UTR. By employing a RT-PCR method, a wild-type
and mutated 3′UTR of ADAM28 mRNA were amplified
from RNA isolated from LOVO cells. The wild-type
and mutated 3′UTR fragment were then cloned into the
downstream of luciferase reporter gene of pMIR-Report
vector (Invitrogen, Grand island, NY, USA). The respective
ADAM28 mRNA luciferase reporter vectors, pMIRReport/ADAM28 (harboring wild-type 3′UTR) and pMIRReport/Mut-ADAM28 (containing a mutated 3′UTR)
were then generated. The specificity of miR-552 targeting
ADAM28 mRNA was ascertained by co-transfection
plasmid DNA of pSicoR/miR-552, miR-552/inhibitor or
pSicoR/NC and pMIR-Report/ADAM28 or pMIR-Report/
Mut-ADAM28 into 293T cells and determined in terms of
the relative activity of firefly luciferase unit (RLU) at 48
h post-transfection using a dual-luciferase Reporter assay
kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A Renilla luciferase
expressing plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) was always included in the transfection to normalize
the efficiency of each transfection.

Immunohistochemistry staining
The expression of ADAM28 in clinic human CRC
and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues was evaluated
by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using rabbit
anti-ADAM28 antibody (1: 200 from Abcam, USA).
The archival paraffin-embedded sections (5 µm) were
deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded alcohol
solution. Tissue sections were microwaved in 10 mM
sodium citrate pH 6.0 for 15 minutes and cooled down
to room temperature (RT) for antigen retrieval. Followed
by treating sections with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes to
inactivate endogenous peroxidase before they were
blocked with blocking buffer (5% sheep serum in PBS)
for 2 h at RT. The primary antibody was then applied
(1:200 in blocking buffer) on the section and incubated
overnight at 4°C. Paralleled sections incubated with
normal rabbit IgG was used for negative controls. After
washing for 3 × 5 min in PBS, sections were incubated
with peroxidase labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (ZSGBBio Origene, Beijing, China) (1:500 in blocking buffer)
for 30 minutes at RT. The ADAM28 signal was developed
with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase substrate,
followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin if it was
applicable. The stained sections were examined and
photographed on a Nikon Optiphot II microscope
equipped with a camera. The non-counterstained sections
were also randomly imaged using a 10× objective lens
for five fields of each section, and five sections for each
sample were evaluated. The obtained images were then for
a semi-quantitative analysis of the ADAM28 expression
by measuring the integrated absorbance (IA) using image
analysis software Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (IPP6.0, Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), and the average
of the IA values of each sample was used as an index of
the expression of ADAM28 expression [42].

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA from infected cells was isolated with
a Miniprep kit, and small RNA was purified with an
RNAiso kit per manufacturer’s recommendations
(Takara, Dalian, China). Total RNA from archival
paraffin sections was isolated using a Mag-Bind® FFPE
RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek Norcross, GA, USA). The
purified RNA was then used for reverse transcription of
the first-strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription
using M-MLV reverse transcriptase. The expression
levels of miRNAs were assessed by the stem-loop
RT-PCR method using the Hairpin-it™ miRNAs. The
sequence of the primer used for reverse transcription
of mature miR-552 included a stem-loop structure,
which was designed based on the sequence of miR-552
(Table 3). The sequence of primer set for amplification
of miR-552 and U6 promoter were listed in Table 3.
The U6 promoter was included and used to normalize
for sample loading and RNA abundance. The qRT-PCR
was performed using a Bio-Rad iQ5 lightcycler using
a TaKaRa SYBR RT-PCR kit (Takara, Dalian, China).
Relative expression was calculated as previously
described using real-time PCR efficiencies and the
crossing point deviation of unknown sample vs control
using the ΔΔ Ct method [43]. The specificity of the
primer sets was determined by sequencing the product
of each qRT-PCR reaction.

on the sequence of human miR-552 from miRBase
database. Restriction endonuclease BamH I and EcoR I
were introduced at 5′-ends of these oligonucleotides,
respectively. The mixture of the sense and anti-sense
oligonucleotides was then used for production of the
precursor of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of miR-552
inhibitor by temperature annealing approach. The miR552 inhibitor precursor was modified with appropriate
restriction enzymes, and cloned into a miRNA expressing
plasmid, pSicoR (Department of Biological Chemistry,
School of Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China)

In order to suppress endogenous miR-552 in CRC
cells, lentiviral vector expressing miR-552 inhibitor or
scramble mRNA were generated by Shanghai GeneMarker
Inc (Shanghai, China). This viral vector was designated
as LV-miR-552-inh and was generated according to

which was designated as pSicoR/miR-552-inh in this

(pSicoR/NC) was also generated using oligonucleotides
of 5′- GATCCGTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTTTCAA
GAGAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAACTTTTTTG -3′ for
sense strand and 5′- AATTCAAAAAAGTTCTCCGAAC
GTGTCACGTTCTCTTGAAACGTGACACGTTCGGA
GAACG-3′ for antisense strand. In order to knockdown the
expression of ADAM28, four lentiviral vectors expressing
shRNAs to human ADAM28 were generated based on
the coding sequence (cds) of ADAM28 provided in
GenBank (BC136478.1). These shRNAs were designed
to respectively target the coding sequence of 5′-GGAC
CACAGCGATAATCTTCT-3′, 5′-GCTCCATTGCCTAC
AGATATC-3′, 5′-GCGATAACAAGGTTTGCATTA-3′
and 5′-GCCTACAAATCAACCAATTGC-3′ of ADAM28
mRNA. These shRNA viral vectors were designated as
LV-shADAM28-972 (the 5′-end nucleotide position from
the start codon of ADAM28 mRNA), LV-shADAM28-1192,
LV-shADAM28-1820
and
LV-shADAM28-1867,
respectively. For production of the lentiviral vectors,
1 × 106 HEK 293T cells were seeded per well in sixwell plates with 2 mL of DMEM/10% FBS without
antibiotics. The next day, the medium was replaced with
1 mL DMEM without FBS and antibiotics. Subsequently,
the proviral vector (1.5 µg) was co-transfected with
packaging plasmids pCMV-VSV-G (0.5 µg) and pCMVdR8.91 (1 µg) (Department of Biological Chemistry,
School of Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China)
with TransLipid Transfection Reagent as suggested by the
manufacturer. The medium was replaced with 2 mL of
DMEM/10% FBS at 6 h post transfection. The supernatant
was harvested at 48 h after transfection, followed by
being filtered through a 0.45-µm pore size filter, and then
concentrated to 1/100 volume by ultracentrifugation with
50000 × g at 4°C for 2.5 h using a SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) and Sorvall Ultra 80®
(Kendro Laboratory Products, Newtown, CT, USA). The
virus particle pellet was resuspended in PBS and frozen
at −80°C till use. The viral particles were titrated in 293T
cells by counting EGFP-positive cells, CRC LOVO and
LS174 cells were respectively infected with each of above
viral vectors, and continuously cultured for 3 days before
being used, or screened in media containing 2.5 μg/mL

employed for further studies.

being transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA).
The membranes were then probed with mouse antiADAM28 antibody (Abcam, USA) and anti-beta-actin
antibody (Boster, Wuhan, China) were for the interested
protein ADAM28 and endogenous beta-actin for loading
control, respectively. The blots were developed using the
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Advansta,
Menlo Park, CA, United States) after they were incubated
with the appropriate peroxidase labeled secondary
antibodies. The levels of protein expression were semiquantified by optical densitometry using ImageJ Software
version 1.46 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The ratio
between the net intensity of each sample divided by the
β-actin internal control was calculated as densitometric
arbitrary units (A.U.)) which served as an index of relative
expression of a protein of interest [42, 44].

MTT assay
Cell proliferation was determined by using the MTT
cell proliferation kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Lentiviral
infected LOVO or LS174T cells were split and seeded in
each 96-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 per well and
allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then used for
MTT assay at indicated time points per the manufacturer’s
instruction (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA).

Cell migration assay
The lentiviral infected CRC cells were seeded at
80% confluent and infected with lentiviral vectors for 48 h
(cells were grown to confluence) in 6-well culture plates.
The cells were then scratched with 200 ml pipette tips. The
resultant unattached cells were removed by washing with
pre-warmed PBS for three times, the wounded monolayers
were cultured for additional 48 h prior to be stained with
0.1% crystal violet solution. The closure of the wounded
areas was observed under a microscope at magnification
of 40× (Leica, Germany) and photographed. The distance
of closure was quantified with the NIH Image J image
processing program. These experiments were performed
in triplicate. Each condition was tested in duplicate and
each experiment was repeated at least three times.

Clonogenic assay
A clonogenic assay was used for accessing the
stemness of CRC cells. For analysis of clonogenicity,
single cell suspension of 700 cells were seed on 35-mm
dishes. Cells were continuously cultured for 10 days
with refreshment of medium 3 days interval. For
colony counting, the medium was removed and the
cells were rinsed with PBS prior to be fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min. After
removing the fixation solution, the cells were then
stained with 0.5 % crystal violet solution and incubate at

Statistical analysis
All data collected in this study was obtained from
at least three independent experiments for each condition.
SPSS17.0 analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
and PRISM 5 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA, USA)
were used for the statistic analysis. Statistical evaluation
of the data was performed by one-way ANOVA when more
than two groups were compared with a single control, and
t-test for comparison of differences between the two groups.
Significant differences were assigned to p values < 0.05,
< 0.01 and < 0.0001 denoted by *, ** and ***, respectively.
Data was presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
