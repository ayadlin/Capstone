BACKGROUND. Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas are a common cause of
cancer-related deaths. In this study, the authors investigated the prevalence and
biological significance of Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) overexpression in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
METHODS. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining on tumor tissue microarrays (TMA) were used to
study the expression of AURKA in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. To
investigate the biological and signaling impact of AURKA, the authors used multiple in vitro assays that included 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
nick-end labeling), cytochrome C release, flow cytometry, luciferase reporter, and

RESULTS. Frequent overexpression of AURKA transcript in upper gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas was detected compared with normal samples (47%; P 5 .001).
The immunohistochemical analysis of 130 tumors demonstrated moderate-tostrong immunostaining of AURKA in >50% of upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. By using camptothecin as a drug-induced apoptosis in vitro model, the
authors demonstrated that the expression of AURKA provided protection against
apoptosis to gastrointestinal cancer cells (AGS and RKO) (P 5 .006) and RIE-1 primary intestinal epithelial cells (P 5 .001). The AURKA overexpression mediated
an increase in phosphorylation of AKTSer473 with an increase in HDM2 level. The

and are characterized by complex molecular changes.
Several epidemiological studies have indicated that
the incidence of proximal adenocarcinomas of the
gastroesophageal junction and lower esophagus is
rising faster than ever before in the Western world.2,3
Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) is 1 of the 3 serine/threonine kinases (A, B, and C) that are evolutionarily conserved and regulate mitotic progression in various
organisms.4 It controls centrosome maturation and
separation, mitotic entry, spindle formation, and chromosome alignment.5,6 The human AURKA gene is
located in chromosome band 20q13, a locus that is
frequently amplified in breast, bladder, ovarian, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancers.7–10 In normal
cells, the AURKA protein level increases periodically
during the cell cycle from G2 to M phase and is
enriched at the centrosome and mitotic spindle.5,11 It
is noteworthy that overexpression of AURKA correlates
with and is predisposing to chromosomal instability in
several tumors.12 Cytological analysis has revealed
that overexpression of AURKA results in centrosome
amplification and cytokinesis failure and, thus, production of aneuploid cells.8 Several inhibitors of
Aurora kinases, such as hesperadin,13 ZM447439,14
and VX-68015 have been developed and are in different
phases of clinical trials.10,15 These evolving drugs hold
a promise of gene-targeted therapy in cancer.
Recent studies have indicated that AURKA overexpression increases resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells.16 AURKA interacts at multiple
levels within the p53 pathways, suggesting that these
proteins form part of an integrated functional network.17 In this study, we investigated the prevalence
and biological significance of AURKA overexpression
in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and
demonstrated the activation of the AURKA/AKT/
HDM2 axis as a potential paradigm for regulating
p53 and cancer-cell survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Samples
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 130 gastric
and/or esophageal resections due to upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, performed between 1995
and 2005, were obtained from Vanderbilt University
Medical Center (Nashville, Tenn) for immunohistochemical analysis. They included 44 lower esophageal, 43 gastroesophageal junction, 8 cardia, and 30
distal gastric (antrum and body) tumors. Tumor
grading was performed according to World Health
Organization (WHO) standards. DNA and mRNA purification were performed by using Qiagen purification kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Single-strand

1689

cDNA was synthesized by using the Advantage realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR Kit; Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
mRNA was isolated from 25 normal gastric cardia
samples and 45 primary upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Gene-specific primers for AURKA,
PUMA, NOXA, and HPRT1 were designed, and the
results were normalized to HPRT1 as described earlier.18 All primers were purchased from GeneLink
(Hawthorne, NY), and their sequences are available
from the authors upon request. qRT-PCR was performed by using an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif)
with a threshold cycle number determined with the
use of iCycler software version 3.0. The reactions
were performed in triplicate, and threshold cycle
numbers were averaged. The fold change in all samples was calculated according to the formula 2(Rt2Et)/
2(Rn2En), as described previously.7
Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry of
AURKA protein
All tumor and normal gastric and esophageal mucosal
epithelial tissues were histologically verified, and representative regions were selected for inclusion in a tissue microarray (TMA). The tumors were classified
into intestinal and diffuse types19 and ranged from
well differentiated (WD) to poorly differentiated (PD).
Clinical staging was performed according to American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria.20 Tissue
cores with a diameter of 0.5 mm were retrieved from
the selected regions of the donor blocks and punched
to the recipient block by using a manual tissue-array
instrument (Beecher, Silver Spring, Md). Sections (5
lm) were transferred to polylysine-coated slides
(SuperFrostPlus; Menzel-Glaser, Brunschwig, Germany)
and incubated at 378C for 2 hours. The resulting TMA
was used for immunohistochemical analysis. An avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase assay was performed
after pretreatment in a microwave with a citrate
buffer for 20 minutes, and rabbit anti-AURKA (KR051;
1:100 dilutions; TransGenic, Kobe, Japan) was applied
at room temperature. Immunohistochemical results
were evaluated for intensity and staining frequency of
nuclear and cytoplasmic components. The intensity
of staining was graded 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). The frequency was graded from
0 to 4 according to the percentage of positive cells as
follows: 0, 3%; 1, 4% to 25%; 2, 26% to 50%; 3,
51% to 75%; 4, 75%. The products of multiplication of the intensity and frequency grades were then
classified into an index core on a scale of 0 to 3: index
score 0 5 product of 0 (negative), index score

Cell culture, vectors, siRNA, and transfection
AGS, RKO, and RIE-1 cells were used in this study.
Cells were cultured in F-12 (HAM) or Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM) together with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) at 378C in an
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. AGS and RKO cells
were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, Va). RIE-1 cells are spontaneously
immortalized, nontransformed, and from an epidermal
growth factor-responsive cell line (A generous gift from
Dr. Robert. J. Coffey, Jr. at Vanderbilt University). The
expression plasmid for AURKA was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the fulllength coding sequence of AURKA and cloned in-frame
into pcDNA3.1. A synthetic Flag tag sequence was added
at the N-terminus of AURKA. Retroviral expression constructs, pBabe-puro, containing either the full-length of
the AURKA coding sequence (pBabe puro-AURKA) or a
kinase-dead AURKA mutant (D274A) were purchased
from Addgene (Cambridge, Mass). AURKA-specific
shRNA sequence (GATCCCC ATGCCCTGTCTTACTGTCATTCAAGAGATGACAGTAAGACAGGGCATTTTTTA)
was cloned in retroviral expression construct pMSCVsiRNA-GFP by using Bgl II and Hind III restriction
enzymes. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-specific
shRNA was cloned in the same vector and used as a
negative control. In addition, we obtained validated
small-interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides specific for AKT (#42,811) and a negative control siRNA
(#4611) (Ambion, Austin, Tex). Transient transfections
were performed by using Fugene 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind) and Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif) following the manufacturers’ protocols.
Retroviral transduction
Ecopack 293 cells (5 3 105 per well) (Clontech, Palo
Alto, Calif) were plated in a 6-well plate. Cells were
transfected with retroviral vectors; empty pBabe-puro
(control) and pBabe-puro-AURKA, respectively. After
48 hours of transfection, viruses were collected, filtered by using 0.45 lM filters, and added to RIE-1
cells in the presence of 8 lg/mL polybrene. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium after
24 hours of transduction.
MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) assay
AURKA-overexpressing AGS cells (5 3 103 per well)
were plated in a 96-well plate. The MTT Cell Assay
kit from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,

Manassas, Va) was used to perform this assay as
recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were
plated in triplicate, and the assay carried out measurements for 3 days.

TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase –mediated
nick-end labeling) apoptosis assay
RKO cells were seeded into 8-well chamber slides
and transfected with 400 ng of pcDNA3-flag-AURKA
and pcDNA3 empty vector (control) per well. Cells
were then treated either with camptothecin (5 lM) or
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; vehicle, control) for 24
hours. After 24 hours, DMSO-treated and camptothecin-treated cells were stained by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche, Indianapolis, Ind), and then observed by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) (red fluorescence). AURKA overexpression was determined by
immunofluorescence staining in duplicate wells with
the Flag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston,
Mass) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-goat
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (heavy + light
[H 1 L]) conjugate (green; Jackson Immuno Research,
West Grove, Pa). TUNEL-positive cells and AURKAexpressing cells (20 random fields at magnification of
403, >400 cells) were then counted.
Cytochrome C release
AGS cells that stably expressed AURKA or pcDNA3
empty vector (control) were cultured into 8-well slide
chambers (12 3 103 cell per well). Cells were then
treated with DMSO (vehicle, control) or 20 lM camptothecin for 4 hours at 378C. Cytochrome C release
was detected by immunofluorescence by using
mouse monoclonal anticytochrome-C antibody and
by following the manufacturer’s recommendations
(Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif ).
Fluorescence assorted cell sorting
Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with 13 ice-cool
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then resuspended in 0.2 mL ice-cold PBS, then fixed in 1mL icecool 70% ethanol, and incubated for 1 hour at 2208C.
The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in 1 mL
PBS and treated with propidium iodide (50 lg/mL)
and RNase (1 lg/mL) for 30 minutes at 378C, and
then analyzed by BD LSR II flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The data were analyzed by Becton Dickinson’s BD FACS Diva software.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared in a phosphate saline
buffer (PBS) containing 13 protease cocktail inhibi-

tor (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) and centrifuged at 3500
rpm for 10 minutes at 48C. The protein concentration was measured by using a Bio-Rad protein assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif). Protein (10–15 lg) from
each sample was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
Target proteins were detected by using specific antibodies as follows: p53, HDM2, and p21Waf1 (Oncogene, San Diego, Calif); ACTIN, AKT, pAKTSer473, BAX,
Anti-Flag, PUMA (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston,
Mass); AURKA (TransGenic, Kobe, Japan); and NOXA
(Imgenex, San Diego, Calif).

Luciferase assays
Luciferase activity assays were performed by using
the pG13-Luc reporter plasmid, which contains 13
tandem repeats of the p53 consensus DNA-binding
sites and measures the p53 transcription activity.21
The pcDNA3-p53 and pcDNA3-DNp73 are described
elsewhere.22 PUMA-Luc luciferase vector was used to
investigate the PUMA promoter activity. We determined the luciferase activity by using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wis).
Results were normalized by using the Renilla luciferase activity (Renilla Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer;
Promega, Madison, Wis) or protein normalization as
indicated. Results were averaged from 3 independent
experiments and expressed as mean values with their
individual data points.

Statistical Analysis
For qRT-PCR data, mRNA expression levels between
groups were assessed by using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
When the overall effect was present, group-by-group
comparisons were made while adjusting the significance level with the Scheffe method.23 Statistical
comparisons were also performed by using the
Student t test. P < .05 was considered to represent a
statistically significant difference. For the immunohistochemical analysis results, patient characteristics
and clinical variables were tabulated, and Fisher
exact tests were used to compare these characteristics between the normal and the AURKA-overexpressed groups.

RESULTS
Frequent Overexpression of AURKA in Upper
Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinomas
We observed the overexpression of AURKA at the
mRNA level in 23 of 32 (71.9%; P 5 .001) proximal

and in 5 of 13 (38.5%; P 5 .013) distal (body and

adenocarcinomas and 25 normal gastric cardia samples were studied for
mRNA expression by using an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif). The average
threshold cycle number for all normal samples was used as a reference
value. All results were normalized to the expression of HPRT1 in the same
sample. Each tumor sample was compared with 25 normal gastric cardia
samples and normalized to HPRT1 expression. Overexpression (2.5-fold) of
AURKA mRNA was detected in 28 of 45 (62.2%) tumors. In proximal samples
(esophageal and gastroesophageal junction), 23 of 32 (71.9%) showed overexpression, whereas only 5 of 13 (46.2%) distal samples (antrum and body
of the stomach) showed overexpression.

(P < .0001; 95% CI, 2.2–5.4) and in 13 distal (P < .004;
95% CI, 0.2–14.4) tumors were significantly higher
than in normal gastric cardia samples (n 5 25). Proximal tumors showed more overexpression of AURKA
(2.5-fold) than distal tumors (P 5 .036) (Fig. 1). However, the difference in expression levels in proximal and
distal samples was not statistically significant (P 5 .48).

FIGURE 3. AURKA overexpression enhances cell survival and counteracts apoptosis. A) AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA or empty vector control were
plated in a 96-well plate (5 3 103 cells per well). Cell survival was determined by MTT assay by measuring optical density (OD) at 570 nM for 3 days. AGS
cells that overexpressed AURKA showed a steep increase in cell survival compared with control (empty vector). B) AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA prevented mitochondrial release of cytochrome C. AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA showed a punctuate mitochondrial staining of cytochrome C after they
were treated with 20 lM camptothecin (CPT) for 4 hours, indicating that these cells did not release mitochondrial cytochrome C and suggesting their viability.
Conversely, AGS cells that expressed empty pcDNA vector (control) demonstrated a bright, diffuse, cytoplasmic staining, indicating a release of cytochrome C
and progression of these cells toward apoptosis. The bar graph demonstrates quantification of cells that showed a release of cytochrome C. C) RIE-1 cells were
transduced with pBabe (control) and pBabe-AURKA vectors and treated with 10 lM camptothecin for 24 hours. Control cells had an increase in the percentage
of cells in the SubG1 phase compared with cells that overexpressed AURKA (pBabe-AURKA); thus, cells that overexpress AURKA are resisting drug-induced apoptosis. The bar graph summarizes the percentage of cells in the SubG1 phase of 3 independent experiments in RIE-1 cells. Individual data points are displayed,
and the horizontal bar indicates the mean value. D) Overexpression of AURKA conferred resistance to camptothecin. TUNEL assay was performed in RKO cells
that harbored wild-type p53. RKO cells were transfected with AURKA or empty pcDNA vector (control) and treated with 5 lM camptothecin for 24 hours or left
untreated. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, each well underwent TUNEL staining (red) and immunofluorescence with COOH-terminus, AURKA-specific
antibody (green fluorescence). DAPI (blue) was used as a nuclear-counter stain to count all cells. The combined picture (red, green, and blue) indicates that
AURKA-expressing cells (white arrows) are virtually protected from camptothecin-induced apoptosis. The bar graph summarizes results and demonstrates the
percentage of apoptosis in AURKA-expressing cells compared with empty pcDNA vector (control).

TMA showed moderate-to-strong immunostaining in
15 of 30 (50%) body and antrum, in 6 of 8 (75%) cardia, and in 53 of 87 (61%) gastroesophageal and
lower esophageal adenocarcinomas (Fig. 2). The immunostaining was predominantly cytoplasmic with a
variable degree of nuclear staining. Interestingly,
when available, adjacent tissues from intestinal
metaplasia and gastric dysplasia demonstrated overexpression of AURKA, suggesting that this could be
an early event in tumorigenesis (Fig. 2). On logistic
regression, there were no statistically significant

associations between AURKA expressions and the tumor site, histologic type, grade, or tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification.

AURKA Overexpression Enhances Cell Survival and
Counteracts Drug-induced Apoptosis
We observed a steep increase in the survival of AGS
cells that overexpressed AURKA compared with cells
that expressed control vector on MTT assay (Fig. 3A).

FIGURE 4. AURKA-AKT axis regulates p53 through HDM2. A) Western immunoblot analysis after AURKA overexpression in AGS cells demonstrated that AURKA
mediates up-regulation in phosphorylation of AKTSer473. In addition to the increase in the phosphorylation level of AKT, there was an increase in the levels of
HDM2 at the protein level. B) The knockdown of AURKA in AGS cells by using AURKA-specific shRNA led to a decrease in AURKA-mediated AKT phosphorylation
and a subsequent decrease in HDM2 levels, indicating that the observed increase in AKT phosphorylation and HDM2 levels were mediated by AURKA overexpression. C) Knockdown of AKT in AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA led to a reduction in HDM2 levels with a notable increase in p53 levels. These data
confirmed that AURKA can regulate p53 levels through AKT-dependent mechanism(s) by modulating levels of HDM2, a major regulator of p53.

advantage. Therefore, we performed additional
experiments to study the role of AURKA in cancercell survival after drug-induced apoptosis. The treatment of AGS cells that stably expressed AURKA, with
20 lM camptothecin for 4 hours, confirmed our hypothesis and did not induce the release of cytochrome C, as depicted by mitochondrial punctuate
staining. Conversely, cells that expressed empty vector (control) demonstrated a diffuse cytosolic staining that indicated a release of cytochrome C and,
thus, progression of these cells toward apoptosis
(Fig. 3B). This finding in cancer cells led us to investigate whether a similar effect could be observed in
primary gastrointestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1),
which could indicate a role for AURKA in early tumorigenesis. Flow cytometry analysis of RIE-1 cells,
transduced with AURKA-expressing retroviral construct, showed a significant decrease in the SubG1
phase compared with cells that expressed control
vector. A 50% reduction in the SubG1 phase was
observed in AURKA-overexpressing RIE-1 cells when
they were treated with 10 lM camptothecin for 24
hours (Fig. 3C). This experiment was repeated 3
times; results are summarized in a bar graph (Fig.
3C). For further confirmation, we analyzed the antiapoptotic potential of AURKA overexpression in gastrointestinal cancer cells by using TUNEL assay on
RKO cells after they were treated with camptothecin.
RKO cells harbor a wild-type p53 and are considered
to be a sensitive measure for p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage.22,24 Indeed, the AURKAexpressing RKO cells showed a considerable reduction (3-fold) in apoptosis compared with cells that
expressed empty vector (control) (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggested that AURKA expression protected cells from drug-induced toxicity.

AURKA Regulates p53 Through an AKT-dependent
Mechanism
Activation of AKT signaling provides potent prosurvival and antiapoptotic signals to cancer cells.25,26
Therefore, we tested whether AURKA could regulate
the level of phospho-AKT in upper gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas. Western blot analysis of AGS cells,
after transient transfection with AURKA, demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation level of
AKTSer473 (Fig. 4A). AGS cells harbor a wild-type p53
and were protected from drug-induced apoptosis
when AURKA was overexpressed (Fig. 3B). Therefore,
we tested whether AURKA could regulate p53 activity
through the AKT-dependent mechanism in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. As shown in Figure 4A,
the increase in pAKT was associated with an increase
in HDM2 protein level. HDM2 plays a critical role in
negatively regulating levels of p53 through ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms. This finding indicated that the AURKA/AKT axis could be responsible
for down-regulating p53 and protecting cancer cells
from apoptosis. We confirmed that AURKA can mediate an increase in the AKTSer473 phosphorylation in
MKN-45 and SEG1 cells (data not shown). We also
validated results and performed the reverse experiment by knocking down the endogenous AURKA in
AGS cells. The reduction in AURKA levels resulted in
a decrease in AKTSer473 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) and
HDM2 levels. Moreover, the knockdown of AKT in
AGS cells that overexpressed pcDNA3-Flag-AURKA,
detected by Flag, led to a reduction in HDM2 levels
with a notable increase in p53, thus confirming that
the AURKA/AKT axis is playing a role in regulating
p53 (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that AURKA
may play a major role in regulating p53 through
AKT-dependent mechanism(s) by affecting the levels

Overexpression of AURKA in Gastric and Barrett-related Adenocarcinomas/Dar et al.

of HDM2, a major regulator of p53. Therefore, our
results provide an important additional mechanism
for regulating p53 in cancer and suggest that this
mechanism could be important in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.

AURKA Suppresses the Transcription Activity and Protein
Level of p53 and Its Downstream Targets
The aforementioned results suggested that regulation
of p53 by AURKA is an important mechanism in
upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Therefore,
we investigated the impact of this regulation on p53
transcription activity and its down stream targets. We
investigated the transcriptional activity of p53 in AGS
cells by using pG13-Luc reporter plasmids. pG13-Luc
contains 13 binding sites for p53 and is used as a
measure of p53 transcription activity. Transfection of
p53, as expected, led to a remarkable induction of
pG13 luciferase activity. On the other hand, cotransfection of p53 together with AURKA showed a significant reduction in pG13 activity compared with p53
alone. In addition, cotransfection of p53 with
AURKA-mutant D274A (kinase dead) did not suppress pG13 activity (Fig. 5A). As expected, cotransfection of DNp73 (positive control) with p53 suppressed
pG13 activity. To confirm the reduction in p53 transcription activity, we investigated the effect of AURKA
on known proapoptotic targets of p53: PUMA, NOXA,
BAX, and p21. The luciferase assay that used the
PUMA-Luc vector in AGS cells cotransfected with
AURKA showed a 5-fold decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 5B). Quantification by qRT-PCR of mRNA
levels of PUMA and NOXA indicated a 53% and a
60% decrease, respectively, in their mRNA expression
levels in AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA compared with controls (Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis
confirmed down-regulation of the p53 targets,
PUMA, NOXA, p21, and BAX (Fig. 5D), at the protein
level. Therefore, our results confirm that AURKA
down-regulates p53 and its proapoptotic transcription targets in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and indicate that the AURKA/AKT axis is a
potential mechanism for providing potent antiapoptotic and prosurvival advantages to cancer cells in
patients with upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.

DISCUSSION
Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas are the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in
the world.27 The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the
cardia, gastroesophageal junction, and lower esophagus has been rapidly rising, 5-fold to 6-fold in the
past few decades, especially in patients younger than

1695

50 years of age.3,28,29 Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas are characterized by poor response to
therapy and an unfavorable clinical outcome that
reflect an inherent protective mechanism in these
tumors against drug-induced apoptosis.30,31 We have
demonstrated frequent overexpression of AURKA
in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and identified the AURKA/AKT axis as an important mechanism that provides cancer cells with potent
antiapoptotic properties through regulating p53dependent apoptosis.
In this study, we detected the frequent overexpression of AURKA at the mRNA and protein levels
in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, and
interestingly, this overexpression was more prevalent
in gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas and
lower esophageal, Barrett-related adenocarcinomas
(BAs) than in antrum and body gastric adenocarcinomas (P 5 .036). We could not identify an association
between AURKA overexpression and histopathological parameters such as tumor grade, TNM classification, and lymph-node metastasis. Overexpression of
AURKA has been reported in other tumors such as
human breast, bladder, colon, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.8,11 Therefore, our findings confirm that
AURKA overexpression is an important mechanism
for several cancer types. We observed AURKA overexpression in premalignant lesions including dysplasia.
This is of particular interest because AURKA plays a
major role in centrosome maturation and cell division, and its overexpression can induce tumor progression by promoting chromosomal instability,
which leads to aneuploidy in bladder cancer cells.32
Chromosomal instability is the hallmark of adenocarcinomas of the stomach and esophagus; thereby,
AURKA overexpression may play a central role in
their early tumorigenesis cascade. However, further
studies are needed to address this important mechanism in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas are typically characterized by poor response to therapy and
low survival rates.30,31 We detected a remarkable
effect of AURKA overexpression on inhibition of
drug-induced apoptosis in several gastrointestinal
cells. Cells that overexpressed AURKA prevented
release of cytochrome C from mitochondria. A
decrease in cytochrome C release led to inactivation
of caspases, thus protecting cells from apoptosis.33
This antiapoptotic effect was further confirmed in
AGS and RIE-1 cells after they were treated with
camptothecin. Overexpression of AURKA, therefore,
could be a factor that contributes to poor clinical
outcome in patients with adenocarcinomas of the
stomach and esophagus.

FIGURE 5. AURKA regulates the p53 transcription activity and its downstream proapoptotic targets. A) Luciferase activity was seen by using pG13-Luc reporter vector in AGS cells. The pG13-Luc is a reporter plasmid containing 13 tandem repeats of the p53 consensus DNA-binding sites and measures p53 transcription activity. pG13-Luc was transfected with different combinations of expression vectors as shown in the x-axis. The transfection of p53 led to a
remarkable induction of luciferase activity of the pG13 reporter. The transfection of DNp73, a known protein that inhibits p53, led to suppression of pG13 luciferase activity, as expected. A cotransfection of p53 with AURKA suppressed pG13 reporter activity. A cotransfection of p53 and DNp73 led to suppression of
transcriptional activity of wild-type p53, as indicated by reduction in pG13 activity. B) AURKA overexpression resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity of
Puma-Luc reporter, a p53 downstream target. C) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for PUMA and NOXA indicated a 53% and 60% decrease in their
mRNA expression levels, respectively, in AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA. Individual data points are displayed, and straight bars indicate mean values. D)
Western blot analysis with cell lysates from AGS cells transfected with pcDNA3-AURKA that were compared with cells transfected with empty pcDNA3 (control)
confirmed down-regulation of p53 downstream targets: PUMA, NOXA, p21, and BAX.

We have demonstrated that AURKA regulates
phospho-AKT levels. AKT regulates fundamental cellular processes linked to tumorigenesis such as cellcycle progression, adhesion, and cell survival.25,26 In
line with this, we found that AURKA overexpression
regulated HDM2 and p53 protein levels in an AKTdependent mechanism. HDM2 is a major regulator

of p53 that regulates its degradation by promoting
ubiquitination via E3 ubiquitination-ligase activity
and by cytoplasmic 26S proteasome.10 The knockdown of AKT in AGS cells that overexpressed AURKA
led to a significant reduction of HDM2 levels with a
parallel induction of p53 protein levels. These results
confirm that the AURKA-AKT axis is required for reg-

ulating HDM2-p53 levels in this model. Therefore,
our findings provide new insight into the role of
AURKA in regulating p53-dependent apoptosis and
enrich existing knowledge of AURKA and p53, as previous reports have shown that AURKA regulates p53
protein levels through direct interaction and phosphorylation of p53 at phosphorylation at Ser31517
and Ser215.34 The p53 protein is a major regulator of
apoptosis, and several cancer drugs work through
induction of DNA damage and activation of p53mediated apoptosis.35,36 The biological outcome of
p53 depends on its ability to activate its downstream
proapoptotic transcription targets.37,38 Although we
have not studied the phosphorylation status of p53,
the total protein level and the transcription activity
of p53 were dramatically impaired by AURKA overexpression. This observation is supported by changes
in transcript and protein levels of several p53 downstream targets, p21, PUMA, NOXA, and BAX. Taken
together, our results indicate that AURKA overexpression regulates p53 through the AKT/HDM2 axis in
upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
In summary, we demonstrated frequent overexpression of AURKA in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Up-regulation of AURKA provided
cancer cells with a drug-resistant phenotype and survival properties. The AURKA/AKT axis is a novel molecular mechanism that underlines the oncogenic
potential of AURKA in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
