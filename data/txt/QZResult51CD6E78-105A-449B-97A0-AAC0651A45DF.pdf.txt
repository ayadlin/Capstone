Abstract
TNF antagonists may offer therapeutic potential in solid tumors, but patients who have high serum levels of
TNF-a fail to respond to inﬂiximab, suggesting consumption of the circulating antibody and loss of transmembrane TNF-a (tmTNF-a) on tumors by ectodomain shedding. Addressing this possibility, we developed a
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds both full-length tmTNF-a and its N-terminal truncated fragment on the
membrane after tmTNF-a processing but does not cross-react with soluble TNF-a. We documented high levels
of tmTNF-a expression in primary breast cancers, lower levels in atypical hyperplasia or hyperplasia, but
undetectable levels in normal breast tissue, consistent with the notion that tmTNF-a is a potential therapeutic
target. Evaluations in vitro and in vivo further supported this assertion. tmTNF-a mAb triggered antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tmTNF-a–expressing cells but not to tmTNF-a–negative cells. In
tumor-bearing mice, tmTNF-a mAb delayed tumor growth, eliciting complete tumor regressions in some mice.
Moreover, tmTNF-a mAb inhibited metastasis and expression of CD44v6, a prometastatic molecule. However, the
antibody did not activate tmTNF-a–mediated reverse signaling, which facilitates tumor survival and resistance to
apoptosis, but instead inhibited NF-kB activation and Bcl-2 expression by decreasing tmTNF-a–positive cells.
Overall, our results established that tmTNF-a mAb exerts effective antitumor activities and offers a promising
candidate to treat tmTNF-a–positive tumors, particularly in patients that are nonresponders to TNF antagonists.

Introduction
TNF-a exists in 2 bioactive forms: a 26-kD transmembrane
form and a 17-kD soluble form that is released after proteolytic cleavage. Both forms of TNF-a display bioactivities
via TNF receptors, TNFR I and TNFRII. TNF-a is a 2-edged
sword for tumors. On the one hand, there is evidence that it
induces tumor necrosis and apoptosis as its name implies.
On the other hand, TNF-a is also reported to promote tumor
development. Although our and others' previous studies
reveal that the ectopic expression of TNF-a at the site of
malignancy induces strong and long-term tumor regression
(1, 2), increasing evidence indicates that TNF-a functions in
promotion and progression of tumors, rather than in protection against tumors, including proliferation, transformation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in many cancers
(3). Knockout of TNF-a or TNFR1 creates mice resistant to

chemical carcinogenesis of the skin or liver, respectively (4,
5). Conversely, pretreatment with TNF-a enhances lung
metastases (6), and overexpression of TNF-a confers invasive properties on xenograft tumors (7). In the clinic, TNF-a
production by tumors is related with a poor prognosis, loss
of hormone responsiveness, and cachexia (8, 9). Most studies
on TNF-a and tumors refer to the soluble TNF-a (sTNF-a), a
typical proinﬂammatory cytokine; thus, sTNF-a is considered to bridge inﬂammation and cancer.
Although sTNF-a originates from the extracellular
sequence of transmembrane TNF-a (tmTNF-a), the bioactivities of both forms of TNF-a are not quite the same. Our
previous study shows that tmTNF-a is able to kill some
tumor cell lines that are resistant to sTNF-mediated cytotoxicity (10). In contrast, tmTNF-a expressed by tumor cells
protects them from apoptosis by inducing constitutive activation of NF-kB via its reverse signaling, as the ectopic
expression of the leader sequence of tmTNF-a [namely
deletion of the sTNF-a sequence, retaining N-terminal truncated fragment (NTF) including the intracellular part of
tmTNF-a] is sufﬁcient to activate NF-kB and render tumor
cells resistant to apoptosis induced by sTNF-a (11, 12).
Conversely, interruption of the reverse signaling mediated
by tmTNF-a increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to
sTNF-a–induced cytotoxicity (12). These data suggest that
tmTNF-a may inﬂuence the opposite actions of sTNF-a,
anti- or protumor. Furthermore, it may be a good tumor surface target for immunotherapy.

Yu et al.

TNF-a antagonists such as etanercept, inﬂiximab, and adalimumab are used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases,
such as rheumatoid arthritis (13) and Crohn's disease (14).
Because TNF-a is believed to be a target for solid tumor
therapy, the efﬁciency of TNF antagonists has been tested in
phase I and II clinical cancer trials as single agents. Although
some patients with advanced cancer indeed beneﬁt from TNFa antagonist therapy (15–17), the patients who have high
serum levels of TNF-a failed to respond to the antibody
inﬂiximab (16). One of the reasons is the consumption of
antibody in the circulation by soluble serum TNF-a so that
the antibody reaching the tumor site decreases. Even though
the antibody can reach the tumor, its tumoricidal effect must
be affected, owing to its ability to bind local sTNF-a (18) that
leads to the competitive inhibition of the antibody targeting
the tmTNF-a on the surface of tumor cells. Another reason is
that tumor cells lose tmTNF-a because of increased ectodomain shedding by overexpressed ADAM 17 in cancers (19). In
the present study, we made a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that
not only binds to full-length tmTNF-a, but also to its stillanchored membrane NTF after tmTNF-a processing without
cross-reaction to sTNF-a. This antibody was shown to have
effective antitumor activities, in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Generation and puriﬁcation of mAbs against tmTNF-a
We obtained the hybridoma-secreting tmTNF-a mAb
using conventional hybridoma technology. Brieﬂy, a fragment
from the signal peptide of tmTNF-a containing an epitope
served as an immunogen. The peptide is conjugated to
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or to bovine serum albumin (BSA). BALB/c mice were immunized 4 times with the
peptide–KLH complex. The hybridoma cells were obtained by
fusion of the resulting splenocytes and SP2/0-Ag14 murine
myeloma, in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000
(Sigma), selected in HAT medium (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine medium; Sigma) and then screened by speciﬁc
binding ELISA. The tmTNF-a mAb-secreting hydridoma cells
were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice for largescale production of mAb. The mAb was puriﬁed by HiTrap
protein G HP (Amersham Biosciences).
ELISA for screening the hydridoma plus analysis of
isotype and speciﬁcity of tmTNF-a mAb produced
In the indirect ELISA, the peptide–BSA complex was used
to coat ELISA plates in a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After
overnight coating, these plates were blocked with PBS solution containing 1% BSA, followed by addition of hybridoma
culture supernatants for a 1-hour incubation. After washing,
antimurine immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) was added into each well. After another
1-hour incubation, the plates were washed and we added
the substrate O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma).
Absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm was read in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
We detected the isotypes of tmTNF-a mAbs by a commercial Mouse Immunoglobulin Isotype Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

For the speciﬁcity analysis of tmTNF-a mAb, sandwichELISA was adopted using tmTNF-a mAb as a capture antibody
and an HRP-labeled mAb to TNF-a that binds to another
epitope (Shanghai Yaji Biotechnology Co. Ltd.) as a detecting
antibody. The peptide–BSA complex, interleukin (IL)-2, BSA,
and IFN-g (Sigma) were used as antigens.
For the inhibitory competitive assay, 200 mg of either a
control peptide (acetylcholine receptor 97–116) or a tmTNF
peptide was used to coat the plates. Puriﬁed tmTNF-a mAb
was incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C with the tmTNF peptide–
BSA complex or sTNF-a in the indicated concentrations,
before addition to the plates. The secondary antibody was
HRP-conjugated antimurine immunoglobulin.
Noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay for
determination of mAb afﬁnity
The afﬁnity constant (Kaff) of the antibody was measured by
ELISA as described by Beatty and colleagues (20). A microtiter
plate was ﬁrst coated with peptide–BSA in different concentrations (5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.65 mg/L) and then incubated with the
indicated concentrations of tmTNF-a mAb. The plate was
sequentially incubated with HRP-conjugated antimurine
immunoglobulin, followed by the substrate as mentioned
earlier. Kaff was calculated by the following formula, where
n ¼ Ag/Ag0 : Kaff ¼ (n  1)/2(nAb0  Ab).
Cell culture
We purchased the human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 from American Type Culture Collection,
and a human malignant B cell line derived from Burkitt
lymphoma, Raji cell, from China Center for Type Culture
Collection, Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei, China). The
breast cancer cell lines T47D, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB453 were a gift from Prof. Jian Lu (Department of Pathophysiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai,
China). Cells were cultured at 37 C in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640
medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
(56 C, 30 minutes), pyrogen-free fetal calf serum (FCS; Sijiqing),
1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2.0 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100
U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 5  105 mol/L
2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). Fresh vials of cells were periodically
thawed and used in experiments to ensure that cell lines were
unchanged in culture during the study.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy
volunteers were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient
centrifugation. Human monocytes and peritoneal macrophages
from mice were puriﬁed by their adherence of cells onto
24- or 96-well plates (Costar; Thomas Scientiﬁc) in 10% FCS
RPMI-1640 medium for 1 hour, and then washed to remove
the nonadherent cells. tmTNF-a expression on the surface of
the monocytes and macrophages was induced by incubation
with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 16 hours.
Plasmids/shRNA transfer
The plasmids pcDNA3.0, containing wild-type (wt) TNF-a
or TNF-NTF(LS) were constructed in our laboratory as
described previously (21). For stable transfection, we generated pIRES2-EGFP/wtTNF-a or pIRES2-EGFP/TNF-NTF

Anti-tmTNF-a Antibody with Antitumor Activities

plasmids containing human cDNA that codes for wtTNF-a
or TNF-NTF, respectively, by inserting the corresponding
PCR product into the vector pIRES2-EGFP. This PCR product was ampliﬁed from TNF-NTF/pcDNA3.0 or wtTNFa/pcDNA 3.0, using 2 pairs of primers (TNF-NTF: forward
TAAGGAATTCATGAGCACTGAAAGCATGATCCGGGA and
reverse ATATGGATCCTATGCCTGGGCCAGAGGGCTGATTAGA; wtTNF: forward TAAGGAATTCATGAGCACTGAAAGCATGATCC and reverse GTAGGATCCTCACAGG GCAATGATCCCAAAG) for 30 cycles (94 C for 20 seconds, 58 C for
20 seconds, 72 C for 30 seconds). The gene-speciﬁc short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) and control shRNA ("HuSH 29mer
shRNA constructs against TNF in pGFP-V-RS vector") were
obtained from OriGene.
A total of 3  105 parental MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were
cultured in 6-well culture plates until 70% conﬂuent. Two
microgram of recombinant plasmid was transfected into cells
using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stable
transfection, selection was conducted in 800 mg/mL G418 for 2
weeks and the bulk-transduced cells were subcloned by limiting dilution at 0.3 cells/100 mL/well in 96-well microtiter
plates and maintained thereafter in 400 mg/mL G418.
Flow cytometry
Binding analysis of tmTNF-a mAb for the expression of
tmTNF-a on the surface of human breast cancer cell lines,
human monocytes or murine peritoneal macrophages was
conducted by ﬂow cytometry. Cells were detached with trypsin–EDTA (Invitrogen) and resuspended in PBS containing 1%
BSA and 0.1% sodium azide. The samples were incubated for 1
hour on ice with tmTNF-a mAb, anti-sTNF-a mAb (Becton
Dickinson), antimurine TNF-a antibody (R&D Systems), or
their corresponding isotype antibodies as negative controls.
After washing with PBS, cell staining was carried out by another
1-hour incubation with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)labeled antimurine or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG;
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Stained cells were
analyzed on a FACSCalibur 440E (Becton Dickinson) using Cell
Quest software (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems).
Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy
A total of 1  105 transfected cells were seeded onto coverslips
placed in a 12-well culture plate overnight. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, these cells were incubated overnight at 4 C with tmTNF-a mAb. After further
washes with PBS, the secondary antibody phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated anti-mouse IgG was applied. The cells were then
observed under a confocal microscope FU5000 (Olympus).
ADCC and CDC assays
For antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC),
peritoneal macrophages from mice served as effector cells. The
target cells were MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast carcinoma
cells including wtTNF-a- or NTF-transfected MCF-7 cells. Both
effector and target cells were incubated together for 24 hours at
an effector/target ratio of 20:1. The target cells were incubated

with either tmTNF-a mAb or a mAb to the surface antigen of
hepatitis B virus (HBVs mAb, as an isotype control, kindly
gifted by Prof. Dongliang Yang, Department of Infection, Union
Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
Wuhan, Hubei, China) for 30 minutes before the addition of
effector cells.
For complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), target cells
were plated at a density of approximately 5,000 cells per well in
the presence of the above 2 antibodies and 5% fresh guinea pig
serum with active complement, and then incubated at 37 C for
4 hours. Cell viability was detected by incubation with CCK-8
(Dojindo) for 4 hours and then the absorbance (A) was measured at 450 nm, with a reference wavelength at 630 nm. Assays
were conducted in triplicate. The percentage of cytotoxicity for
each test type was calculated as follows:

Xenotransplantation of MDA-MB-231 cells into nude
mice
Our animal studies were approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology. Six-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (weight
16–20 g; Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd.) were
housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free environment with a 12-hour
light–dark cycle and allowed ad libitum access to food and
water. A total of 2  106 human MDA-MB-231 cells were
inoculated into the right mammary fat pads of these mice
(7 per group). Tumor size was measured every 5 days with
microcalipers and it was calculated by assuming the following
equation (22): length  width2  p/6.
tmTNF-a mAb (120 or 240 mg per mouse) was injected
intraperitoneally every 3 days. The treatment began at day 14
after transplantation and lasted 6 weeks. As a control, 120 mg of
HBVs mAb or the same volume of normal saline was inoculated
intraperitoneally.
Total protein preparation and Western blot analysis
Total protein was extracted from cultured cells or frozen
tumor tissue in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH
7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40,)
containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem) on ice
for 15 minutes. Twenty microgram protein was fractionated by
12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred from the gel onto a
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking
with 5% nonfat milk in PBS–Tween-20 (0.05%) overnight at
4 C, the membrane was then probed with antibodies speciﬁc to
p-p65, Bcl-2, caspase-8, or b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
followed by a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody against
rabbit/mouse IgG. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
from NEN LIFE Science was used to visualize the antibody

each sample and represented as the average number of tumor
emboli in 5 ﬁelds.
TNF-a bioassay
A total of 5  103 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and
incubated overnight at 37 C, in 5% CO2. The following day, 200
U/mL sTNF-a (PeproTech) was added and incubated for 24
hours. Cell viability was then detected by staining for 4 hours
with CCK-8. The photometric measurement was conducted at
450 nm, with a reference wavelength set at 630 nm. TNFa–induced cytotoxicity was calculated by using the following
formula: cell death rate (%) ¼ (1  ODsample/ODcontrol)  100%.

Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining
Diseased breast tissues were collected from patients in
Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, including 39 patients with breast cancer, 15 patients with
atypical dysplasia, 10 patients with hyperplasia, and 5 normal
breast tissues that were adjacent to breast tumors. Archival
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained slides for each case
were reviewed by a pathologist. This study was approved by
the Clinical Research Committee of Tongji Medical College
(Wuhan, Hubei, China).
Sections of 4-mm thick, formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded tissues from the patients or animal experiments were
deparafﬁnized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol.
Following heat-mediated antigen retrieval, tmTNF-a, phosphorylated NF-kB p65, Bcl-2, or CD44v6 were detected in
the diseased tissue by the avidin–biotin complex method.
The sections were incubated for 1 hour with the corresponding speciﬁc primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
followed by washing, another 1-hour incubation with biotinlabeled antimurine IgG antibody (Boyao Biotechnology),
washing again, and then incubation with peroxidase-labeled
streptavidin for 20 minutes. Immunostaining was visualized
by color reaction to diaminobenzidine for 5 minutes. As a
negative control, isotype antibody was substituted for the
primary antibody. Then, the percentages of brown-stained
cells indicating the presence of tmTNF-a, phosphorylated
NF-kB p65, Bcl-2, or CD44v6 were determined. The positive
cell ratio (integral optical density value/integral area) was
calculated by Tongji Qianping Image Analysis Software.
Tumor invasion area in the lymph node was measured at
200 magniﬁcation in 10 ﬁelds for each sample, namely the
area occupied by tmTNF-a–positive tumor cells was analyzed
using the Image-Pro Plus software version 6.1 (Media Cybernetics) and expressed as a percentage of total lymph node area.
To evaluate apoptosis in tumors that was induced by
treatment with tmTNF-a mAb, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
was carried out with a commercial kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclei were
counterstained with hematoxylin. TUNEL-stained cells were
counted at 400 magniﬁcation, in 5 high-power ﬁelds, by the
Image-Pro Plus software version 6.1. The apoptotic index (AI)
was calculated as follows: AI ¼ (number of positive cells/total
number of cells)  100%.

Identiﬁcation of mAb to tmTNF-a
To make a mAb to tmTNF-a, the extracellular part of the
signal peptide of the molecule was synthesized and conjugated
to the carrier KLH, and then used to immunize BALB/c mice.
The hybridoma cells were made by fusion of the resulting
murine splenocytes and myeloma cells. After screening, we
obtained several mAbs to tmTNF-a, which were identiﬁed as
IgG1 and k light chain. We puriﬁed one of them by HiTrap
protein G HP and proved puriﬁcation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A).
The afﬁnity constant of the mAb was 1.00  109, as determined
by ELISA noncompetitive assay (Fig. 1B). The speciﬁcity of the
mAb was detected by binding ELISA and inhibitory competitive ELISA. Results showed that the antibody only bound to
tmTNF-a peptide conjugated with BSA, but did not cross-react
to BSA, IL-2, or IFN-g (Fig. 1C). We showed, by preincubation of
the antibody with tmTNF-a peptide conjugated with BSA or
sTNF-a in different concentrations, that there was speciﬁc
binding of tmTNF-a mAb with the tmTNF-a peptide, but not
with control peptide, as when coated on the plate it
was signiﬁcantly competitively inhibited by the peptide–BSA
complex (>8 ng; Fig. 1D), and yet, it was unaffected by sTNF-a
(Fig. 1E). This indicated that the speciﬁcity of the antibody is
directed to tmTNF-a, instead of sTNF-a. To detect whether the
antibody could bind to native tmTNF-a on the surface of cells,
we used LPS to activate human monocytes to express tmTNFa and a human B lymphoma cell line, Raji, which was previously conﬁrmed as expressing tmTNF-a at a high level (12).
Indeed, ﬂow cytometry showed that tmTNF-a mAb, like the
antibody to sTNF-a, could bind speciﬁcally to the human
tmTNF-a on the surface of Raji cells (Fig. 1F) and LPS-activated
monocytes (Fig. 1G), but it could not bind to murine
tmTNF-a on the surface of LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1G).

Histology
Parafﬁn-embedded sections (4 mm) of tumors were stained
with H&E and evaluated under a microscope in a blinded
manner. Tumor emboli in the blood vessels or lymphatic
vessels were counted at 200 magniﬁcation in 10 ﬁelds for

Figure 1. Identiﬁcation of tmTNF-a mAb. A, the ascites containing tmTNF-a mAb were puriﬁed by HiTrap protein G HP and the purity of the mAb was
conﬁrmed by electrophoresis on 12% PAGE. B, Kaff of the mAb was measured by noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay. Various concentrations of tmTNF-a
mAb were added to plates that were precoated with the indicated concentrations of tmTNF peptide–BSA. The binding of antibody to the antigen was detected
with HRP-conjugated antimurine immunoglobulin, followed by a color reaction by addition of substrate. Kaff was calculated as mentioned in Materials and
Methods. C, the speciﬁcity of tmTNF-a mAb was analyzed by sandwich-ELISA. The tmTNF-a mAb and an HPR-labeled mAb to the sTNF-a epitope

or primary breast cancer. We found that tmTNF-a staining
was strong positive on breast cancer, and weaker on atypical
hyperplasia and hyperplasia, but it was negative in normal
breast tissue (Fig. 2A and B). The positive rate was 92.3% for
breast cancer, 80% for atypical hyperplasia, and 33.3% for
hyperplasia, indicating that the expression of tmTNF-a
becomes increased from benign breast mass to malignant
breast neoplasm. Furthermore, we also detected tmTNF-a
expression on 5 breast cancer cell lines. As is shown in Fig.
2C, tmTNF-a expression was at higher levels in MDA-MD435 and MDA-MD-231 cells (52.94% and 89.14%, respectively), at lower levels in T47D and MDA-MD-453 cells, but
undetectable in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, we used the
MDA-MD-231 cell line as the target cells for tmTNF-a mAb
in in vitro and in vivo experiments. To further conﬁrm the
speciﬁc binding of the mAb to the full length of tmTNF-a or
to its NTF that is still bound to the surface of cells after
ectodomain shedding of tmTNF-a, we stably transfected
tmTNF-positive MDA-MD-231 or tmTNF-negative MCF-7
cells with shRNA or wtTNF-a and its NTF, respectively. We
conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) that
the mAb could detect the downregulation of tmTNF-a
expression on MDA-MD-231 cells transfected by shRNA (Fig.
2D) and the upregulation of tmTNF-a expression on MCF-7
cells that were transfected with wtTNF-a (Fig. 2E). Similarly,
the results of confocal microscopy using this mAb showed
that tmTNF-a staining on the MDA-MD-231 cell line became
weakened because of shRNA (Fig. 2F), whereas tmTNF-a
staining on the MCF-7 cells became positive, owing to
transfection of wtTNF-a (Fig. 2G). In addition to detection
of the full-length tmTNF-a, this mAb could also recognize
NTF at the surface of MCF-7 transfectants, as shown by
FACS (Fig. 2E) and confocal microscopy (Fig. 2G).
tmTNF-a mAb mediated ADCC and CDC toward
tmTNF-a–expressing breast cancer cell line
Next, we explored the ADCC and CDC effects of our mAb to
tmTNF-a on MDA-MD-231 target cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
antibody effectively mediated the cytotoxicity of macrophages
toward tmTNF-a–expressing breast cancer cells in a dosedependent manner, with its effect reaching a peak at a concentration of 2 mg/mL (P < 0.001). In contrast, this antibody
failed to mediate ADCC to a tmTNF-a–negative cell line, MCF7 (Fig. 3B). In addition, a mAb to HBV surface antigen (HBVs)
had no effect on the tmTNF-a–positive and -negative breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 3B).
Similarly, tmTNF-a mAb also exerted CDC toward the
tmTNF-a–expressing MDA-MD-231 cell line, but not to the
tmTNF-a–negative MCF-7, in a dose-dependent manner, exhibiting maximal effect at 2 mg/mL in the presence of complement (Fig. 3C). In comparison with the effective CDC of
tmTNF-a antibody, the antibody to HBVs had no CDC
observed toward either the tmTNF-a–positive or -negative
breast cancer cell lines, pointing out the speciﬁcity of action by
that tmTNF-a antibody (Fig. 3D).
Furthermore, we examined whether the mAb mediates
ADCC and CDC toward NTF-carrying tumor cells. As is shown
in Fig. 3E and F, the ectopic expression of either wtTNF-a or

4066

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

NTF rendered the MCF-7 cells sensitive to tmTNF-a antibodymediated ADCC and CDC, indicating that this mAb also has
functionality after tmTNF-a processing.
In vivo antitumor activity of tmTNF-a mAb on tmTNFa–expressing human breast cancer in a mouse model
To observe the antitumor effect of the mAb in vivo on
tmTNF-a–expressing breast cancer, we ﬁrst inoculated
MDA-MD-231 cancer cells into nude mice. The tumor formation rate was about 95%. After 2 weeks, the tumors
formed grew to a visible size (0.05 cm3) and we then
treated the animals with the mAb every 3 days for 6 weeks.
We showed that tmTNF-a mAb signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor
growth (Fig. 4A; P < 0.001) and that tumor size became
markedly smaller (Fig. 4B; P < 0.01), as compared with the
controls. Furthermore, tmTNF-a mAb induced complete
tumor regression in 3 mice. Although the inhibitory rate of
tumor growth was shown to be 70% or more by treatment
with tmTNF-a mAb in either of 2 doses (Fig. 4C), the effect of
the antibody in the lower dose seemed to be better. In
contrast, treatment with HBVs mAb had no inﬂuence on
tumors. Moreover, we found that tmTNF-a mAb treatment
mainly induced tumor apoptosis, as there were many brownstained apoptotic cells by TUNEL (Fig. 4D) and obvious
activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 4E) in tumors treated with
tmTNF-a mAb, as compared with tumors treated with saline
or HBVs mAb controls.
Histologic examination revealed that in addition to the
pathologic active karyokinesis aspect, tumor emboli in
blood or lymphatic vessels were obviously observed in
control tumors, whereas ﬁbrosis and inﬂammatory cell
inﬁltration were evidently seen in the tumors treated with
tmTNF-a mAb, accompanied with a signiﬁcantly decreased
number of tumor emboli in blood and lymphatic vessels
(Fig. 5, top). Furthermore, treatment with tmTNF-a mAb
suppressed tumor lymph node metastasis as manifested by a
clearly decreased invasion area in lymph nodes and a
declined rate of lymph node metastasis, as compared with
those in control tumors (Fig. 5, middle). The expression of
CD44v6, a molecule associated with tumor metastasis, also
declined following treatment with tmTNF-a mAb, but not
with HBVs mAb or saline (Fig. 5, bottom). The data indicated that tmTNF-a mAb had apparent antitumor effects
in vivo.
tmTNF-a mAb markedly suppressed tmTNF-a–mediated
reverse signaling
Previously, we proved that tmTNF-a–expressing tumor
cells are resistant to sTNF-a–mediated apoptosis, via activation of NF-kB through its reverse signaling (11, 12).
Therefore, we checked whether tmTNF-a mAb affects
tmTNF-a–mediated reverse signaling, although the epitope
recognized by this antibody is not located at the receptorbinding site of tmTNF-a. As expected, our results showed
that treatment with tmTNF-a mAb did not activate tmTNFa reverse signaling, instead, it inhibited this pathway in vivo.
As shown in Fig. 6, tmTNF-a mAb treatment resulted in a
signiﬁcant reduction of tmTNF-a staining (top) that was

tmTNFa mAb failed to affect the levels of p-p65 and Bcl-2

direct effect of the antibody on tmTNF-a reverse signaling.
We speculated that the deletion of tmTNF-a strong positive
cancer cells in vivo might contribute to the inhibition of
tmTNF-a reverse signaling. To test this hypothesis, we checked
for tmTNF-a expression on MDA-MD-231 cells after the
mAb-mediated ADCC. Indeed, the tmTNF-a expression was
signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 7B), similar to that on shRNAtransfected MDA-MD-231 cells (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we used
stably shRNA-transfected MDA-MD-231 cells to examine
changes in tmTNF-a reverse signaling. As expected,

MDA-MD-231 tumors were treated (intraperitoneally) every 3 days with tmTNF-a mAb in 2 doses, 120 mg (lower dose, LD), or 240 mg (higher dose, HD).
The treatment started on day 15 and lasted 6 weeks. HBVs mAb (120 mg) and normal saline inoculated (intraperitoneally) served as the nonspeciﬁc and the
untreated controls, respectively. Tumor growth curves (A), tumor size (B), and inhibitory rate of tumor growth (C) were observed and compared among

downregulation of tmTNF-a expression decreased levels of pp65 and Bcl-2 in these cells, as compared with control (Fig. 7C),
and rendered originally sTNF-resistant MDA-MD-231 cells
sensitive to the cytotoxicity of sTNF-a (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
The best molecular target for antibody treatment is a
membrane molecule on the surface of a tumor, but not in the
normal tissue, because of antibody accessibility to antigenic
determinants for exerting ADCC and CDC toward the tumor.
Although it is reported that sTNF-a can be released by solid
tumors, including breast cancer (3, 23), there is no clinical data
about tmTNF-a expression on the surface of breast cancer.

www.aacrjournals.org

Here, we show that tmTNF-a is a surface marker for a part of
breast cancers, but is absent in normal mammary tissue.
Interestingly, the results from our limited survey of patients
showed that the degree of tmTNF-a expression was different in
benign breast mass and malignant breast neoplasms, namely,
the order of its expression rate and expression intensity was:
breast cancer > atypical hyperplasia III (precancerous lesion) >
hyperplasia (benign breast mass). It is likely that tmTNF-a
expression becomes upregulated during the development from
breast mass to breast cancer. Whether tmTNF-a–positive
(þþþþþ) atypical hyperplasia has a tendency to develop
carcinoma was unclear, so it should be further investigated.
Furthermore, our results indicated that the level of tmTNF-a
expression on cancer cells, rather than serum TNF-a, is a good

biomarker for determining the antibody-targeting therapy. In
this regard, patients with tmTNF-a–positive tumors may
beneﬁt more from TNF antagonists than those with tmTNFa–negative tumors.
As tmTNF-a can be cleft by ADAM17, releasing sTNF-a and
leaving NTF (namely, the leader sequence of tmTNF-a) membrane-anchored until intramembrane cleavage occurs (21, 24),
we developed a mAb that not only binds to full-length tmTNFa, but also to NTF (Fig. 2), increasing its opportunities to attack
tumor cells by targeting more molecules on the surface of
breast cancer cells. Especially when tmTNF-a processing is
increased because of ADAM17 overexpression, NTF becomes
important for antibody targeting and efﬁcacy. Indeed, our
results showed that tmTNF-a antibody mediated ADCC and
CDC not only toward tmTNF-a–positive MDA-MD-231 and
wtTNF-transfected MCF-7 cells, but also to NTF-carrying
transfectants of MCF-7. However, our mAb had no ADCC and
CDC on tmTNF-a–negative parental MCF-7 cells. The treat-

4070

ment of tmTNF-a–positive tumor-bearing mice with this
antibody signiﬁcantly suppressed tumor growth and even led
to total tumor regression in 3 mice, displaying an obvious
antitumor effect. In addition, tmTNF-a mAb had no crossreaction to sTNF-a, thus it avoids wasting of the antibody in
the circulation and may diminish the treatment dosage and
possible side effects.
Another possible advantage of this antibody is that its
afﬁnity constant was about 109. The avidity of the antibody
is not so high that it may only attack tumor cells with a high
density of tmTNF-a, but neither neutralizes sTNF-a nor
inﬂuences normal cells (including immune cells) with a low
density of tmTNF-a. This may leave a physiologic concentration of TNF-a non-neutralized and beneﬁt the resistance of
patients to infection and tumorigenicity.
Another feature of the best molecular targets on tumors for
antibody therapy is the requirement of this target molecule
for tumor growth, resistance to apoptosis, and promotion of

results show that once a tumor expresses tmTNF-a, it
becomes resistant to sTNF-a–induced apoptosis. This is
mediated by constitutive activation of NF-kB, through
tmTNF-a reverse signaling (11, 12). Constitutive activation
of NF-kB is a main cause responsible for the resistance of
tumor cells to apoptotic stimuli, including chemotherapy and
radiotherapy (25). In line with our previous study, these study
results showed that tmTNF-a–positive breast cancer was
accompanied with NF-kB activation (phosphorylation of NFkB p65) and the expression of Bcl-2, one of its target genes
encoding antiapoptotic molecules. The treatment with
tmTNF-a mAb did not activate, but instead impaired reverse
signaling of tmTNF-a, as NF-kB activation decreased and its
targeted gene Bcl-2 was consequently downregulated. It is
unlikely that tmTNF-a mAb directly affected reverse signaling by interference with the interaction between tmTNF-a
and TNF receptors, because tmTNF-a exists as a compact

conical-shaped trimer and the epitope that tmTNF-a mAb
recognizes is near the cell membrane, under the base of this
bell-shaped trimer (26) and is thereby not included in the
binding site for TNFR. As expected, our in vitro results showed
that tmTNF-a mAb had no effect on the levels of p-p65 and
Bcl-2 in tmTNF-a–positive MDA-MD-231 cells. As decreased
tmTNF-a expression in the tumor by tmTNF-a mAb treatment was accompanied with the suppression of tmTNF-a
reverse signaling in vivo, we presumed that tmTNF-a mAb
treatment decreased at least the number of tumor cells with
high-density tmTNF-a by ADCC and CDC, so that the reverse
signaling of tmTNF-a in the rest of the tumor cells with
lower density of this membrane molecule was consequently
crippled. This hypothesis was conﬁrmed by evidence that
tmTNF-a expression on MDA-MD-231 cells was signiﬁcantly
decreased after ADCC and that downregulation of tmTNF-a
decreased the levels of p-p65 and Bcl-2 in the cells. Furthermore, we proved that tmTNF-a antibody induced the apoptosis of tumor cells, showing increased TUNEL-stained cells

Figure 7. Contribution of tmTNF-a mAb-induced deletion of tmTNF-a strong–positive cells for inhibition of reverse signaling. A, MDA-MD-231 cells were
treated with tmTNF-a mAb in the indicated concentrations for a period of 30 minutes for p-p65 or 12 hours for Bcl-2. The expression of p-p65 and Bcl-2
was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The loading control was b-actin. B, MDA-MD-231 cells were subjected to tmTNF-a–mediated ADCC as
described in Materials and Methods, and then tmTNF-a expression was determined by ﬂow cytometry. E, effector cells. C, the expression of p-p65 and
Bcl-2 in MDA-MD-231 cells that were stably transfected with shRNA was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results (A and C) shown are
representative of 3 independent experiments. D, shRNA-transfectants of MDA-MD-231 were incubated with 200 U/mL sTNF-a for 24 hours. Cell
viability was then detected by CCK-8 staining. Data represent the mean percentage (bars; SEM) of 3 independent experiments (B and D) made in

and the activation of caspase-8 in the tumors. In addition to
ADCC, another possible reason for the observed increased
apoptosis was inhibition of NF-kB activation through the
antibody-induced downregulation of tmTNF-a, which may in
turn sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis induced by sTNF-a
(12) or by other proapoptotic molecules, such as FASL (27)
and TRAIL (28, 29). Our evidence that downregulation of
tmTNF-a by shRNA rendered originally sTNF-resistant MDAMD-231 cells sensitive to sTNF-a–mediated cytotoxicity
supports this hypothesis. It is consistently reported that the
deﬁciency of TIMP3, a physiologic inhibitor of the TNF
sheddase ADAM 17, leads to an increase in sTNF-a release
(thus less tmTNF-a) and activation of caspase-8 in regressed
mammary tissue, which is reversed by reconstitution with
recombinant TIMP3, inducing more tmTNF-a expression as a
result of the inhibition of its processing (30).
Our results showed that tmTNF-a mAb signiﬁcantly suppressed blood or lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer, one
of antitumor effects of this antibody. It is well known that
sTNF-a is associated with tumor metastasis (3), as sTNF-a
induces angiogenesis by promoting VEGF expression (31, 32)
and stimulates production of chemokines and adhesion
molecules (33, 34) that are involved in tumor metastasis.
High serum concentration of TNF-a in patients with breast
cancer correlates with invasive tumors (35). Because the
tmTNF-a mAb did not neutralize sTNF-a, its inhibition of
tumor metastasis may be attributed to (i) interference with

4072

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

constitutive NF-kB activation, reducing activation of its
targeted prometastatic genes such as MMP9 and VEGF
(33); and (ii) removal of tumor cells with a high density of
tmTNF-a by ADCC and CDC, as those tumor cells may have
high metastatic and invasive potential (further validation is
needed). In addition, the CD44 molecule plays an important
role in distant malignant metastasis. It exists in a standard
form (CD44s) or a variant form (CD44v). CD44v6 contributes
to metastasis and its expression reaches 100% in metastatic
carcinoma present in the lymph nodes of patients with
breast cancer (36). It has been reported that sTNF-a upregulates CD44s, CD44v3, and CD44v6 expression via the p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in MDAMB-231 cells (37). Our results showed that tmTNF-a mAb
decreased CD44v6 expression, suggesting that tmTNF-a may
be responsible for the induction of this molecule, which is
involved in the metastasis of breast cancer.
Although anti-TNF-a agents are used to treat solid tumors
including breast cancer (15–17), higher circulating concentrations of TNF-a are observed in the nonresponding patients
(16), suggesting that the infused antibody must be quickly
bound by sTNF-a and cleared from the blood, thereby
markedly reducing arrival of efﬁcient amounts of the antibody to the tumor. Even though the antibody enters into the
tumor site, a portion of these can be also consumed by sTNFa in that microenvironment and the tumor may lose the
membrane molecule because of ectodomain shedding, thus

Anti-tmTNF-a Antibody with Antitumor Activities

weakening the biologic efﬁcacy of the antibody. Besides, if
antibody reaching the tumor cannot effectively kill tumor
cells, it may enhance reverse signaling by binding to tmTNF-a
(18), which may favor tumor progression through activation
of NF-kB. In contrast, tmTNF-a mAb neither binds to sTNF-a
nor activates reverse signaling of tmTNF-a. In addition, our
results showed that the antibody induced a decrease of
tmTNF-a expression and its reverse signaling, which sensitized tumor cells to apoptosis (11). Our data indicated that
the tmTNF-a mAb is a promising therapeutic antibody and
may be suitable for targeted cancer therapy, although we have
a long way to go before it is humanized and further evaluated
for clinical purposes.
