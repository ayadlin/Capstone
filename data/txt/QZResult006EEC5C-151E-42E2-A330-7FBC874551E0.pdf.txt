Abstract
Phosphatiditylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) is activated in some cancers by direct mutation, but it is activated
more commonly in cancer by mutation of upstream acting receptor tyrosine kinases (TK). At present, there is no
systematic method to determine which TK signaling cascades activate PI3K in certain cancers, despite the likely
utility of such information to help guide selection of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug strategies for personalized
therapy. Here, we present a quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry approach that
identifies upstream activators of PI3K both in vitro and in vivo. Using non–small cell lung carcinoma to illustrate
this approach, we show a correct identification of the mechanism of PI3K activation in several models, thereby
identifying the most appropriate TKI to downregulate PI3K signaling. This approach also determined the
molecular mechanisms and adaptors required for PI3K activation following inhibition of the mTOR kinase
TORC1. We further validated the approach in breast cancer cells with mutational activation of PIK3CA, where
tandem mass spectrometry detected and quantitatively measured the abundance of a helical domain mutant
(E545K) of PIK3CA connected to PI3K activation. Overall, our findings establish a mass spectrometric approach to
identify functional interactions that govern PI3K regulation in cancer cells. Using this technique to define the
pathways that activate PI3K signaling in a given tumor could help inform clinical decision making by helping
guide personalized therapeutic strategies for different patients. Cancer Res; 71(18); 5965–75. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The phosphatiditylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is central to growth and survival of many cancers. PI3K is
a lipid kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] leading to membrane recruitment
and activation of specific proteins with pleckstrin homology
(PH) domains, including AKT. Although there are several
classes of PI3K, class IA PI3Ks are the most intimately linked
to cancer cell growth and survival (1). These enzymes are
heterodimers, consisting of a regulatory subunit, p85, and a
catalytic subunit, p110 (2). Recent cancer genome sequencing

efforts have revealed that PI3K signaling can be directly
activated by genetic mutations. Most commonly, these mutations are in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110a subunit, and
in PTEN, the gene encoding the phosphatase that degrades
PIP3, the lipid product of PI3K (3). Moreover, several studies
have shown that PI3K signaling is critical for tumorigenesis
and tumor maintenance, even in cancers that lack PIK3CA or
PTEN mutations (4–9). In many of these cancers, class IA PI3K
is activated upon direct binding to receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) and/or adaptor proteins. The p85 regulatory subunit
binds to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins via 2 SH2 domains.
The engagement of the p85 SH2 domains with tyrosinephosphorylated receptors and adaptors recruits PI3K to the
membrane where its lipid substrate resides (10–12). Currently,
there is no validated method to determine how PI3K is
activated in different cancers, although this information
would provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies.
Recent work has shown that when RTK inhibitors are
effective against a particular cancer, inhibition of the RTK
invariably leads to downregulation of PI3K signaling (13).
Thus, when a cancer is "oncogene addicted" to an RTK,
PI3K is under the sole regulation of that RTK, and the
corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) leads to suppression of PI3K signaling. Furthermore, cancers develop
resistance to kinase inhibitors when secondary events restore
PI3K signaling in the presence of the TKI (13). Thus, detailed
understanding of the regulation of PI3K signaling is important
for determining both sensitivity and resistance to targeted
therapies.

Over the past few years, we and others have utilized
immunoprecipitations of PI3K to identify the associated
phosphotyrosine proteins, and thus the pathways directly
activating PI3K (14–18). Currently, this is primarily accomplished through biochemical approaches using multiple p85
IPs assessed by Western blot analyses and is only effective
when sensitive and specific antibodies are available. To date,
these approaches have been time consuming with low yield. In
recent years, there has been a growing trend of using IP
combined with mass spectrometry (MS; refs. 19–21). In this
study, we evaluated the efficacy of tandem MS using a targeted
approach to quantify and assess the association of adaptors
and RTKs with PI3K in several different cancer models and
paradigms. We also tested the mechanistic role of activating
PIK3CA mutations in cells that harbor these mutations. These
results show that MS can identify the mechanisms of PI3K
activation in cancers and can successfully point to the appropriate RTK inhibitor(s) that will lead to PI3K suppression.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Cells were lysed in a 1% NP-40 containing lysis buffer.
Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000  g for 5 minutes at
4 C. The supernatant was used for subsequent procedures.
Coimmunoprecipitations were done by incubating 10 mg of
the cell lysate with the p85a rabbit polyclonal antibody
(Millipore) and protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare)
overnight at 4 C. Beads were precipitated, washed with lysis
buffer, and boiled in sample buffer containing beta mercaptoethanol. Western blot analyses were conducted after separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose or
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies against
ERBB3 and AKT were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibodies against GAB1, GAB2, IRS1, and pTyr
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. All were
used per manufacturer's directions. Antibody binding was
detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer).
Western blot images were captured using GeneSnap image
acquisition software.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non–
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line HCC827 (del
E746_A750) has been extensively characterized (15, 16).
HCC827 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro; Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS. The EGFR wild-type
(WT) squamous cancer cell line A431 was made resistant to 1
mmol/L gefitinib by Jeff Engelman [Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH), Boston, MA] as described previously (17) and
named A431Gefitinib Resistant (A431GR). A431GR cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1
mmol/L gefitinib. EBC-1 cells containing MET amplification
(15) were obtained from Jeff Settleman (MGH), H3122 containing an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) gene translocation
(22) were obtained from Pasi J€anne (Dana Farber Cancer
Institute, Boston, MA) and H1703 NSCLC cells (23) were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. All were
grown in RPMI-1640 media with 10% FBS. Estrogen receptor–
positive MCF7, HER2-amplified SKBR3, and BT474 breast
cancer cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium media with 10% FBS. Three KRAS-mutant NSCLC
cells lines (A549, H460, and H23) were cultured in RPMI 1640
media supplemented with 10% FBS. All growth media was
supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL
streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine. Growth factors [epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)] were purchased from
R&D Systems and used at 50 ng/mL. PHA-665752 was purchased from Tocris. The stock solutions were prepared in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 20 C. Imatinib,
gefitinib, and NVP-AEW541 were obtained from American
Custom Chemical and used at 1 mmol/L. TAE-684 was purchased from Selleck and was used at 100 nmol/L. Rapamycin
was purchased from Sigma and used at 50 nmol/L. Cells were
treated with TKIs in 10% FBS for 6 hours except for rapamycin,
which was used for 16 hours.

Scrambled siRNA transfection and E545K expression
IRS and scrambled siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon, and transfection was done by using Qiagen HiPerFect
Transfection Reagent. HA-tagged WT or E545K p110a coding
sequences were excised from the JP1520 retroviral vector and
cloned into the LZRS-Neo retrovirus (Gary Nolan laboratory,
Stanford University, Stanford, CA). BT474 and SKBR3 cells
were infected with viral supernatants produced by Phoenix
cells and transfected with the LZRS-p110a retroviral construct. After transfection, cells were selected for 10 to 14 days
in G418.
Xenograft studies
Nude mice (nu/nu; 6–8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories) were used for in vivo studies and were cared for in
accordance with the standards of the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Each mouse was innoculated s.c.
with a suspension of 5  106 H3122 lung cancer cells in 0.2 mL
PBS into the lower right quadrant of the flank. When tumors
reached approximately 400 mm3, tumors were treated with
TAE-684 administered at 25 mg/kg/d or vehicle alone via
orogastric gavage as described previously (22). After 2 days of
treatment, tumors were excised and approximately 130 mg
was homogenized and lysed. A total of 12 mg of lysate was
used for p85 immunoprecipitation. Tumors were measured
twice weekly and mice were monitored daily for body weight
and general condition. The experiment was terminated when
the mean tumor volume of either the treated or control groups
reached 2,000 mm3.
Mass spectrometry
Targeted ion tandem mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitations for the p85 complex were separated by SDS-PAGE
until the 52-kDa marker was observed (short gel run, 1/6
distance of mini gel lane). Gel sections were excised above the
55-kDa band (IgG heavy chain) to avoid antibody contamination and peptide signal suppression. Gel sections were
reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested

overnight with TPCK modified trypsin (Promega Corp.). Peptides were extracted, concentrated to 10 mL using a SpeedVac,
and analyzed by positive ion mode reversed-phase liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
using a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Peptides were delivered and separated using
an EASY-nLC nanoflow HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems) at 300 nL/
min using self-packed 15 cm length  75 mm i.d. C18 fritted
microcapillary columns. Solvent gradient conditions were 50
minutes from 3% B buffer to 38% B (B buffer: 100% acetonitrile;
A buffer: 0.1% formic acid/99.9% water). Peptide precursor m/z
ratios representing p85 binding proteins (Table 1) were targeted in the ion trap portion of the LTQ-Orbitrap XL for MS/MS
via collisionally induced dissociation (CID) using Xcalibur
software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) across the entire chromatogram. For targeted ion MS/MS (TIMM) experiments,
approximately 5 to 9 sequencing events were acquired per
peptide sequence for average total ion current (TIC) calculations, depending upon sample abundance. TIMM cycle time for
16 IT MS/MS scans including 1 FT MS scan was approximately
2.4 seconds using a MS2 max inject time of 100 m per second.
MS/MS spectra were analyzed using Sequest in Proteomics
Browser Software (PBS; W.S. Lane, Harvard University, Boston,
MA) by searching the reversed and concatenated Swiss-Prot
protein database (version 57.5: 470,369 entries) with a parent

fied in Sequest as a fixed modification and oxidation of
methionine (þ15.9949) as a variable modification. Targeted
peptide sequences were initially accepted if they matched the
targeted protein from the forward database and met the
following PBS scoring thresholds for 2þ ions: Xcorr  1.9, Sf
 0.4, P  5, Dmass < 10 ppm. After passing the scoring
thresholds, all MS/MS were then manually inspected to be
sure that b- and y-fragment ions aligned with the assigned
sequence. False discovery rates for peptide identifications were
calculated to be less than 0.5%.
Relative quantification via average TIC. The TIC from
each identified MS/MS spectrum was recorded in PBS. Validated data files were imported as .txt into in-house developed
NakedQuant (v1.1, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
Boston, MA) software for MS/MS based quantification (24).
NakedQuant was programmed in MatLab and designed to
conduct as a platform for quantifying proteins across biological conditions according to average TIC, spectral counts,
and sum TIC. It contains a protein grouping algorithm and
normalization calculations based on median TIC signal or a
single protein (bait) and calculates ratio changes between
selected samples. Here, the level of p85a/b was normalized
across biological conditions. Relative quantities of each protein were calculated by averaging the TIC values from all
targeted peptide MS/MS spectra per protein and compared
across sample conditions. After NakedQuant conducted quantitative calculations, data were exported to Excel for plotting.
Note that Scaffold 3.1 software (Proteome Software) can also
be used for MS/MS TIC calculations. Biological and/or technical replicates were done for all targeted experiments, including xenografts where 2 mouse tumors were used and HCC827
where biological triplicates were done. Coefficient of variation
values were calculated and used in error bars on plots.

Results
To determine how Class IA PI3K is activated in various
cancer models, we conducted label-free quantitative mass
spectrometry on p85 immunoprecipitations from cell
lysates using antibodies that recognize both the p85a
and p85b regulatory subunits. The complex of p85-associated proteins was purified via SDS-PAGE, excised above
55 kDa to avoid antibody contamination, digested with
trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem
mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The known activators of
PI3K that bind directly to p85 all have molecular weights
greater than 55 kDa. Initially, we assessed these PI3K
complexes using a nontargeted or "shotgun" data-dependent LC/MS/MS label-free method termed spectral TIC or
"average TIC" that averages the MS/MS TIC values across
all identified peptides per protein as we previously
described (24–28). However, the shotgun results suffered
from high levels of nonspecific protein associations, a
common difficulty for antibody-based immunoprecipitation MS experiments (29, 30). This led to unreliable detection of the critical p85 binding proteins that we were
attempting to quantify likely due to MS signal suppression
of adaptor peptides.

Targeted MS/MS of PI3K interactions
Because most of the major PI3K-activating proteins are well
known, we targeted specific tryptic peptide precursor ions
from the known PI3K activating proteins for MS/MS fragmentation via CID over their chromatographic elution, a label-free
quantitative experiment referred to as "Targeted Ion MS/MS"
(TIMM). Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the schematic of the
TIMM approach using hybrid linear ion trap/orbitrap mass
spectrometry technology. Using a single LC/MS/MS run from a
tryptic digestion of a gel purified p85 complex, we targeted and
quantified only 16 peptides representing p85a, p85b, and 6
proteins (IRS1, IRS2, GAB1, GAB2, PDGFR, and ERBB3) known
to bind directly to p85a and p85b due to their multiple pYXXM
motifs binding to SH2 domains on p85. The peptides were
chosen because they represent the most consistent and
abundant peptide signals from tryptic digestions and shotgun
LC/MS/MS done in our laboratory and are from regions where
phosphorylation or other posttranslational modifications were
not significantly detected. The individual peptides were isolated, fragmented, identified via database searching, and quantified by averaging the TIC values across all identified MS/MS
spectra per protein. Table 1 lists the peptides used for the

A

TIMM experiment. Of note, 4 ERBB3 peptides were used,
whereas other adaptor proteins were represented by only 1
or 2 peptides. More ERBB3 peptides were used because it was
more difficult to identify this adaptor and the quantitative
information was more robust with multiple peptides. Adding
peptides to other proteins did not significantly improve sensitivity. Because the number of total peptides for targeting was
low, chromatographic scheduling, a frequently used feature for
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments, was not
required. Nonscheduled targeted runs allow for potential shifts
in chromatographic elution that could otherwise result in
missed information and allows for the technology transfer
across different chromatographic platforms. It is important
to note that average TIC values are dependent upon MS
ionization and fragmentation efficiency and can be reliably
assessed relative to other samples in a quantitative manner
because TIMM data do not represent absolute concentrations
of tryptic peptides and their protein precursors in the absence
of isotope labeled standards. However, by normalizing the TIC
values for each adaptor protein to the values for p85 from the
same immunoprecipitate, it is possible to compare relative
amounts of p85-associated proteins in different cells or

Targeted Mass Spectrometry to Identify PI3K Activators

profound loss of PI3K-AKT signaling and decreased association between PI3K and phosphotyrosine adaptor proteins (14–
17). Therefore, in this cell line, we compared the p85 complexes in the absence and presence of the EGFR kinase
inhibitor, gefitinib. In EGFR mutant NSCLCs, we recently
determined that HGF causes resistance to EGFR inhibitors
by rescuing PI3K signaling via a mechanism independent of
ERBB3 via GAB1 (16). As shown in Fig. 1A, the TIMM method
shows that treatment of HCC827 cells with gefitinib decreases
the binding of p85 to ERBB3, IRS1, GAB1, and GAB2, and that
HGF partially restores binding to the phosphotyrosine proteins except for ERBB3. These results are in agreement with
the Western blot studies (Fig. 1C).
The encouraging results from the EBC-1 and HCC827 cells
prompted us to test this targeted MS-based methodology in
other NSCLC models. We examined H1703 cells, and interestingly, found that platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) was the only adaptor bound to PI3K (Fig. 2A). This
interaction was obliterated by the PDGFR inhibitor, imatinib.
Using Western blots, we confirmed that the association

compare changes in these ratios in response to growth factors
or drugs.
This targeted approach was examined initially in the NSCLC
EBC-1 and HCC827 cell lines (Fig. 1A). EBC-1 cells have
amplification of the MET (HGF receptor) tyrosine kinase,
and treatment with a MET TKI leads to suppression of
PI3K signaling (15). EBC-1 cells were assessed in the absence
and presence of the MET inhibitor PHA-665,752. As shown by
Western blot analyses, treatment with the MET inhibitor led
to a loss of AKT phosphorylation and a marked reduction in
the binding of several phosphotyrosine proteins to PI3K that
correspond to ERBB3, GAB1, and GAB2 (Fig. 1B). These results
were recapitulated independently by the TIMM approach
(Fig. 1A). Please note that the quantitative changes observed
by Western and TIMM analyses were slightly different for
HCC827 cells. This is partly due to the fact that the TIMM and
Western experimenters were prepared from different cell
preparations.
An EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line, HCC827 is highly sensitive
to EGFR TKIs. Treatment with an EGFR inhibitor leads to

by gefitinib or by the IGF-IR/InsR inhibitor, NVP-AEW541
(Fig. 2B). Accordingly, only imatinib led to loss of AKT
phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These results are in agreement
with a recent report showing that this cell line has high
activation of PDGFR and is sensitive to imatinib in vitro
(23). In addition, we assessed a cell line that was made
resistant to gefitinib, A431GR. We previously showed that
these cells are resistant to EGFR inhibitors through activation
of IGFI-R that leads to persistent PI3K signaling despite EGFR
inhibition (17). When these cells were analyzed by TIMM, we
observed that treatment with gefitinib led to loss of ERBB3
binding to p85, but combined treatment with both an EGFR
and IGF-IR/InsR inhibitor (NVP-AEW541) abrogated the
interaction between p85 and both IRS proteins and ERBB3,
consistent with our previously published Western blot analyses (17). In agreement with the TIMM data, concomitant
EGFR and IGFI-R/InsR inhibition was required to suppress
AKT phosphorylation in A431GR cells (Fig. 2C).

Mouse xenograft model
The encouraging results using cell lines led us to ask
whether we could utilize this methodology to determine
PI3K activators in vivo. For this study, immunodeficient mice
were injected with H3122 NSCLC cells and tumors were
allowed to develop (400 mm3). H3122 tumors harbor an
EML4-ALK translocation and are sensitive to ALK inhibitors in
vivo and in vitro (22). Mice-bearing tumors were treated with
an ALK inhibitor, TAE-684, or vehicle (DMSO) control for 2
days. Tumors (130 mg) were excised and used to prepare
approximately 12 mg of protein lysate for p85 immunoprecipitation and TIMM analysis. Figure 3A shows that the primary
adaptors for PI3K activation are IRS1 and IRS2 in H3122
mouse xenografts. Interestingly, treatment with TAE-684 eliminates these interactions, suggesting that ALK signals to PI3K
via IRS2 and IRS1. This is consistent with previous reports
suggesting that NPM-ALK signals to PI3K via IRS proteins (31,
32). The finding that IRS proteins were utilized to activate
PI3K suggested that these cells might activate PI3K in
response to IGF-I. Indeed, treatment of H3122 cells with
IGF-I, but not EGF or HGF, rescued PI3K-AKT signaling with
TAE-684 treatment (Fig. 3B). Of note, EGF and HGF rescued
ERK signaling showing that these cells do respond to those
ligands, but that they are unable to rescue PI3K-AKT signaling.
Effect of rapamycin on the PI3K complex
Previous studies have shown that inhibition of TORC1 with
rapamycin induces PI3K-AKT signaling by derepressing a
negative feedback. In some cancer types, this is mediated
by derepression of IRS1 and activation of IGF-IR signaling (33).
Thus, we used the TIMM approach to determine the molecular mechanism of this feedback. Several NSCLC cell lines
were serum starved and then treated with vehicle or rapamycin for 16 hours, lysed, subjected to immunoprecipitation
with anti-p85 antibodies, and analyzed by mass spectrometry.
As shown in Fig. 4A, in the KRAS mutant H23, A549, and H460
cells rapamycin induced an interaction of p85 with IRS2 but

decreased the interaction with IRS1. As shown in Fig. 4B,
Western blot analysis of the A549 and H23 cells confirmed that
rapamycin enhanced the interaction between p85 and IRS2
but impaired the interaction between p85 and IRS1, thereby
verifying the mass spectrometry data. Furthermore, knockdown of IRS2, but not IRS1, abrogated the capacity of rapamycin to induce AKT phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 4C).
The reason why p85 switches from IRS1 to IRS2 in response to
rapamycin treatment of these KRAS transformed cell lines is
not clear. Apparently, the IRS2-PI3K complex is more critical
than the IRS1-PI3K complex for AKT activation. IRS protein
band shifts are due to loss of previously characterized phosphoserine and phosphothreonine sites (34). Figure 5 shows an

cluster according to treatment and cell line. The expansion of
this heat map with data from other cell lines, xenograft
models, and, eventually, human cancer specimens may ultimately provide a reference that will predict mechanisms of
PI3K activation in different cancer types. For example, the
heat map clearly indicates that PI3K in H1703 cells is driven
solely by PDGFR, a situation where imatinib was the effective
treatment.
Quantifying the E545K PIK3CA mutation
In addition to determining the mechanism of PI3K activation, we tested whether the same p85 immunoprecipitations
could quantify the amount of mutant p110 in those cancers
harboring a somatic mutation. PIK3CA, the gene encoding
p110a, is mutated in some cancers. These mutations are
usually located in one of the 2 "hotspots" in the gene (35–
37). One exists in the helical domain (E545K) and the other in
the kinase domain (H1047R). Both have been linked to aberrant

PI3K-AKT activation (36, 38, 39). We obtained several cancer
cell lines known to possess the E545K mutation including
breast carcinoma MCF7 and NSCLC H460. As controls, we
included 2 p110a WT breast cancer cell lines, SKBR3 and
BT474, that were infected with retroviruses encoding E545K
p110a mutant. The total level of the WT E545 p110a peptide
DPLSEITEQEK (2þ, m/z 644.82) was normalized across all
samples. Because only a single peptide was quantified across
conditions, sum TIC was used rather than average TIC. The WT
and mutated [DPLSEITK (2þ, m/z 451.75)] tryptic peptides are
different lengths and contain amino acid differences, so it is
possible that the ionization efficiency of each peptide varies.
However, a difference in the TIC value ratio of the E545 mutant
to the WT p110a between cell types or in different immunoprecipitates from the same cell provides useful information. As
shown in Fig. 6A, the TIMM method correctly identified the
presence of the E545K mutation in MCF7 cells (40) and the lack
of this mutant protein in p85 immunoprecipitates from WT
SKBR3 and BT474 cells (41). The TIMM method also detected
the E545K mutant in SKBR3 and BT474 cells that were

engineered to express this protein, and the relative TIC values
indicate that the ratio of mutant to WT p110a is considerably
higher (nearly 10-fold) in the engineered cells, although this
increase may be inflated because the total level of p110 is higher
in the overexpressed cells.
In addition, we took advantage of the quantitative nature
of this assessment to determine whether the E545K mutant
is preferentially recruited to phosphotyrosine adaptors. We
used the H460 NSCLC cells that harbor the E545K p110a
catalytic site mutation and IRS proteins to associate with
p85 for activation of PI3K/AKT (Fig. 4A). We compared the
ratio of the mutant PI3K in p85 immunoprecipitations
(holoenzyme bound to adaptor and free) versus IRS1 immunoprecipitations (PI3K bound to adaptor in active state). We
observed that the relative amount of E545K is greater than 2fold higher in the IRS1 immunoprecipitations (fully active
form; Fig. 6B). This result is consistent with structural
analyses of E545K suggesting that the mutation abrogates
an intermolecular interaction with an SH2 domain in p85
(11, 12). Therefore, in the PI3K holoenzymes containing
E545K, the untethered SH2 domain could be more available
to bind to phosphotyrosine adaptors. The MS/MS fragmentation spectra and the extracted ion chromatograms for the
WT and mutant peptides are shown in Fig. 6C and D,
respectively. We also attempted to target the H1047R
p110a mutation from BT474 engineered breast cancer cells;
however, this mutation resulted in a tryptic peptide
(QMNDAR) of weak signal in MS, and its molecular weight
was too small for reliable MS/MS identification. Alternative
proteolytic enzymes and/or MRM may be better suited for
quantifying H1047R by MS.

The central role of PI3K in the sensitivity and resistance to
targeted therapies has increased the need for understanding
the molecular regulation of this enzyme in cancer cells. In this
study, we used a targeted MS approach. This approach
effectively identifies the activators of PI3K and holds promise
for understanding how various cancers regulate PI3K in a
dynamic manner.
Initially, we used a nontargeted tandem MS (shotgun)
approach to determine the adaptor proteins bound to p85
in cancer cells. Although this method effectively identified
several PI3K-activating proteins, it was not sufficiently sensitive or quantitative to specifically determine the phosphotyrosine proteins activating PI3K across NSCLC cell lines. Thus,
we switched to a targeted approach to quantitatively measure
the association of PI3K with key adaptors and RTKs that are
the most common activators of PI3K. Although there are
several methods for conducting quantitative analyses of protein interactions by MS, we used hybrid ion trap-orbitrap
technology whereby we targeted peptide ions for isolation and
fragmentation in the ion trap component. The trap fills with
product ions of each peptide precursor ion across the chromatogram and generates sufficient and quantitative signal
when the peptide of interest elutes from the column. We have
used a similar technique to quantify phosphopeptide signals
from various signaling proteins (42–44). Alternatively, one can
use stable isotope labeling approaches such as SILAC (45) or
chemical tagging approaches such as iTRAQ (46) in addition
to label-free quantitative methodologies including spectral
counting (47) and MRM (48). SILAC is a metabolic labeling
approach that is useful in cell culture but is not readily
adapted to in vivo tissue sources, whereas iTRAQ requires
cleanup and a chemical labeling step that can be affected by
the sample matrix (49). In this study, we observed that hybrid
linear ion trap–orbitrap mass spectrometers can be used for
successful label-free quantification in targeted mode if the
total number of peptides is kept low because the cycle time is
slower than that for triple quadrupole mass spectrometers in
MRM mode.
Currently, several methods are available for assessing the
status of PI3K signaling pathway in cancers, including genetic
analyses and assessment of the abundance of downstream
signaling events such as phospho-AKT. However, no validated
methods exist for determining how PI3K is activated in
cancers, especially those without PIK3CA or PTEN mutations.
This study validates a simple MS method to make such
determinations. Although we determined how PI3K was activated in a variety of cancer paradigms in this study, there are
clearly other applications. For example, MEK inhibitors (8)
and other cellular stresses such as radiation (50) can lead to
activation of PI3K signaling, and this method could be used to
determine the molecular mechanisms of activation. Indeed,
this approach could identify potential therapeutic targets that
would prevent PI3K activation in response to these stresses. In
addition, one can include hot spot mutations in oncogenes
such as PIK3CA in the targeted approach to correlate mutation
status with adaptor activation. We also evaluated other RTKs

not find evidence of direct p85 binding because these receptors lack multiple pYXXM motifs, although they associated
with known adaptors at low levels in some p85 immunoprecipitations.
Herein, we showed that MS, in combination with immunopurification of signaling complexes, can be used to identify oncogenic pathways driving tumor growth using
milligram quantities of tumor tissue. As these MS results

are coupled with comprehensive genetic analyses of cancers,
the mechanisms of PI3K activation may be predicted by the
genetic abnormalities harbored by a particular cancer, thus
leading to personalized therapeutic strategies that block
PI3K activation.
