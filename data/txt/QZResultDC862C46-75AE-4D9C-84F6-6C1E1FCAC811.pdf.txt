ABSTRACT:
The elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms is important to improve cancer
patient survival. In this report, we investigated the role and mechanism through which
receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a mediator in cell survival and death signaling,
participates in cancer’s response to chemotherapy. In lung cancer cells, knockdown
of RIP1 substantially increased cisplatin-induced apoptotic cytotoxicity, which
was associated with robust JNK activation. The expression of the JNK inactivating
phosphatase, MKP1, was substantially reduced in RIP1 knockdown cells. Although
MKP1 protein stability was not altered by RIP1 suppression, the synthesis rate of
MKP1 was dramatically reduced in RIP1-suppressed cells. Furthermore, we found
that the expression of miR-940 was substantially increased in RIP1 knockdown cells.
Knockdown of miR-940 restored MKP1 expression and attenuated cisplatin-induced
JNK activation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, ectopic expression of MKP1 effectively
attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. In addition, activation
of the JNK upstream signaling kinase, MKK4, was also potentiated in RIP1 knockdown
cells. Altogether, our results suggest that RIP1 contributes to cisplatin resistance by
suppressing JNK activation that involves releasing miR-940-mediated inhibition of
MKP1 and suppressing activation of MKK4. Intervention targeting the RIP1/miR-940/
MKP1/JNK pathway may be used to sensitize platinum-based chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

survival with chemotherapy has been achieved clinically,
chemoresistance, either primary or acquired, greatly
hinders clinical application of anticancer drugs [3]. The
cellular signaling balance between survival and death is
one of the determining factors in cancer cells’ response
to anticancer drugs. Consequently, increased survival
and/or suppressed apoptosis signaling underlie some of
the mechanisms for chemoresistance [4, 5]. Therefore,

Cisplatin is a major frontline chemotherapeutic
widely used to treat different cancers. Although
suppression of cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis
may be involved, cisplatin directly kills cancer cells
through the induction of apoptosis [1, 2]. While substantial

tipping the cellular signaling balance between survival and
death towards the side of death could improve anticancer
chemotherapy [4].
Cisplatin kills cancer cells through the crosslinking
of DNA, leading to replicative DNA damage, which in
turn activates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [6, 7]. As
a main MAP kinase activated by extracellular stimuli
and intracellular stresses, JNK is activated for apoptosis
by cisplatin [6, 8]. The MAP3K-MAP2K-JNK kinase
cascade [9], where MKK4 and MKK7 phosphorylate JNK
for its activation [10, 11], is often the target for cell death
signaling. Additionally, the activity of JNK is negatively
regulated by a group of MAPK phosphatases of which
MKP1 is the major JNK suppressor [12]. Interestingly,
cisplatin induces MKP1 expression [8], which is assumed
to be a cytoprotective response to cisplatin in cancer
cells. More recently, MKP1 is implicated in resistance
to cisplatin in breast cancer [13, 14]. Although numerous
mechanisms such as drug efflux and detoxification, DNA
repair activation, and apoptosis inhibition are implicated
in cisplatin resistance [10, 11], retaining MKP1 expression
and suppressing JNK activity may blunt cytotoxicity
induced by cisplatin in cancer cells.
Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) is important
for cell survival signaling [15-19]. However, recent
studies have revealed a pro-death role for RIP1 under
certain conditions [20-23]. Therefore, RIP1 stands at a
unique position for the mediation of signals induced by
different stimuli for either cell survival or death. Recently,
an oncogenic role for RIP1was proposed in glioblastoma
[24]. We found that RIP1 is overexpressed in human lung
cancers and RIP1 promotes cigarette smoke carcinogeninduced human bronchial epithelial cell transformation,
supporting a lung cancer promoting role for RIP1 [25].
In this report, we investigated the role of RIP1 in cancer
cells’ response to chemotherapy and provided evidence
that RIP1 participates in chemoresistance to cisplatin.
RIP1 suppresses JNK activation through releasing miR940-mediated suppression of MKP1 expression, which
in turn attenuates the anticancer activity of cisplatin; and
targeting the RIP1/miR-940/MKP1 pathway may sensitize
platinum-based anticancer therapy.

found it was dramatically potentiated by RIP1 suppression
(Fig. 1C, 1D). The specific pharmacological JNK inhibitor,
SP600125, significantly lessened cisplatin-induced cell
death (Fig. 1E, 1F). These results strongly suggest that
RIP1 suppresses cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity through
inhibiting JNK activation.

JNK-dependent apoptosis induced by cisplatin in
RIP1 knockdown cells.
Because cisplatin kills cancer cells through inducing
apoptosis and JNK is activated in apoptosis [6-8], we
examined if RIP1 regulates cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity
through JNK-mediated apoptosis. Cisplatin-induced
apoptosis, exhibited as enhanced activation of caspase 3
and cleavage of PARP, was enhanced in RIP1 knockdown
cells (Fig. 2A, 2B). The pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD and
z-VAD attenuated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in RIP1
knockdown cells (Fig. 2C, 2D and data not shown). In
addition, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, significantly
suppressed cisplatin-induced activation of caspase 3 and
cleavage of PARP in RIP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2E,
2F). These results suggest that RIP1 suppresses cisplatininduced apoptosis by inhibiting JNK activation.

Reduced MKP1 expression contributes to
cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity
in RIP1 knockdown cells
To elucidate the mechanism through which RIP1
contributes to cisplatin-induced JNK activation, we
investigated if JNK inactivation is involved in RIP1mediated JNK suppression by focusing on MKP1, a
major JNK phosphatase involved in cisplatin resistance
[13, 14]. The expression of MKP1 was significantly
reduced in both RIP1 knockdown A549 and H460 cells
(Fig. 3A). To determine if MKP1 reduction was the main
reason for JNK activation, MKP1 EE, a degradationresistant and enzymatically active MKP1 mutant [28], was
used to reconstitute MKP1 activity in RIP1 knockdown
cells. Ectopic expression of MKP1 EE dramatically
suppressed cisplatin-induced JNK activation (Fig. 3B),
and significantly rescued cells from cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that MKP1
suppression plays a major role in cisplatin-induced JNK
activation and cytotoxicity in RIP1 knockdown cells.

RESULTS
RIP1 knockdown potentiates cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity involving JNK activation.

Reduced MKP1 protein synthesis rate contributes
to reduced MKP1 expression in RIP1 knockdown
cells

Stable RIP1 knockdown was established in A549
and H460 cells, dramatically increasing cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A, 1B). Because JNK is activated by
cisplatin to induce apoptosis for killing cancer cells and
RIP1 is involved in JNK induction by diverse stimuli [6, 8,
25-27], we examined cisplatin-induced JNK activation and

cells. The expression levels of MKP1 mRNA were

hardly changed, while the protein concentrations were
significantly lowered (Fig. 3A, 4A), suggesting a
posttranscriptional mechanism for MKP1 reduction.
In addition, when compared to control cells, the MKP1
protein degradation rate was unaltered in RIP1 knockdown
cells (Fig. 4B). However, by examining the accumulation
of newly synthesized protein through shut down of
proteasomal protein degradation with MG132, the protein
synthesis rate detected was significantly suppressed in
RIP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). These results strongly
suggest that reduced MKP1 protein synthesis but not
increased protein turnover contributes to suppressed

MKP1 expression in RIP1 knockdown cells.

Increased miR-940 is responsible for MKP1
protein expression suppression in RIP1
knockdown cells
Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAmediated suppression of translation is a major mechanism
for gene expression regulation [29]. Thus, we explored
potential microRNA-mediated regulation of MKP1. In a
search with miRWalk (http://www.umm.uni-heidelberg.

de/apps/zmf/mirwalk/), miR-940 was suggested to be a
potential MKP1 regulating microRNA. Using an miRNA
microarray assay, miR-940 was found to be among the
increased miRNAs in RIP1 knockdown A549 cells (data
not shown). Using quantitative PCR, we confirmed
that miR-940 was increased in RIP1 knockdown cells
(Fig. 5A). Knockdown of miR-940 effectively restored
MKP1 expression in RIP1 knockdown cells but had
little effect on the MKP1 expression level in the control
cells (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the JNK inactivating
role of MKP1, knockdown of miR-940 to restore MKP1
expression strongly suppressed cisplatin-induced JNK
activation (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, knockdown of miR940 effectively suppressed cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity
in RIP1 knockdown but not in the control cells (Fig. 5D).
Taken together, these results suggest that RIP1 suppresses
cisplatin-induced and JNK-mediated cytotoxicity through

releasing the constraint of miR-940 on MKP1 expression.

RIP1 knockdown potentiates cisplatin-induced
MKK4 activation
We also examined the upstream activating cascade
for JNK. While no detectable activation of MAP3Ks,
such as ASK or MEKK1, were detected in either control
or RIP1 knockdown cells, a clear activation of MKK4
was detected in RIP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 6A, data not
shown). Notably, the basal level of MKK4 activity in RIP1
knockdown A549 and H460 cells was elevated compared
to the control cells (Fig. 6A). MKK7 activation, another
MAP2K known for JNK activation, was not detected in
either control or RIP1 knockdown cells (data not shown).
These results suggest that RIP1 suppressed cisplatin-

DISCUSSION

induced JNK activation also involves blocking of MKK4
activation.
We further examined whether miR-940 has a
direct impact on MKK4 activation induced by cisplatin.
The results show that knockdown of miR-940 had no
detectable effect on MKK4 expression levels, suggesting
that this microRNA does not regulate MKK4 expression.
However, miR-940 knockdown slightly suppressed
phospho-MKK4 in RIP1 suppressed cells (Fig. 6B),
suggesting that miR-940 indirectly potentiates cisplatininduced MKK4 activation when RIP1 is suppressed and
these underlying mechanisms deserve further study.

In this report, we show evidence substantiating a
cytoprotective role for RIP1 in lung cancer cell’s response
to cisplatin that includes suppression of JNK-mediated
apoptotic cytotoxicity. RIP1 knockdown substantially
increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells
that was dependent on JNK activation. The synthesis
rate of the JNK inactivating phosphatase, MKP1, was
reduced in RIP1 knockdown cells. Furthermore, the
expression of miR-940 was remarkably increased in RIP1
knockdown cells, and knockdown of this microRNA
restored MKP1 expression and attenuated cisplatin-

induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. Importantly,
ectopic MKP1 expression effectively attenuated cisplatin-

induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. We also show
that RIP1 suppresses cisplatin-induced JNK activation
entailing MKK4 blockage. Thus, our results suggest
that RIP1 suppresses JNK activation through release of
miR940-mediated suppression of MKP1 expression and
blockage of MKK4, resulting in cisplatin resistance (Fig.
7). Interventions targeting this JNK activation pathway
may sensitize platinum-based anticancer therapy.
While RIP1 was reported to mediate cytotoxicity
for anticancer drugs under some circumstances [30-32],
a cytoprotective role for RIP1 is documented [15, 1719, 33]. The main mechanism for RIP1 involvement
in resistance to cancer therapeutics is supposedly its
mediation of cell survival signals such as NF-κB and Akt
[15, 24, 34, 35]. Recently we found that RIP1 mediates
autophagy to attenuate TRAIL’s cytotoxicity in cancer
cells [36]. In this report, we identify a novel cytoprotective
mechanism for RIP1 that involves suppression of JNKmediated apoptosis signaling. Thus, consistent with
previous reports, these results suggest that the role of
RIP1 in cancer cells’ response to therapy is complex, and
may depend on cell context or cytotoxicity inducers, and
the cytoprotective function of RIP1 can be either due to
survival promotion or suppression of apoptosis signaling.
While the MAP3K-MAP2K-JNK kinase cascade is
a major target for JNK regulation due to many cellular
stresses [9], cisplatin-induced activation of MKK4
was remarkably increased in RIP1-suppressed cells.
Furthermore, our results indicate that JNK activation by
cisplatin relies on reduced MKP1 expression in RIP1
knockdown cells. The critical role of MKP1 in suppressing
cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cell death was
substantiated with restoration of MKP1 activity by
introduction of a constitutive active MKP1 mutant into the
RIP1-suppressed cells. These results highlight MKP1 as
an important factor for cancer cell survival and resistance
to cisplatin, which is consistent with the reported role of
MKP1 in breast and ovarian cancer cells [37-39].
Our results further suggest that the suppression of
protein synthesis by miR-940 is the major mechanism for
MKP1 expression reduction in RIP1 knockdown cells.
MKP1 expression is controlled at multiple levels including
that of transcription, translation and protein stability [13].
We previously found that the dietary flavonoid, luteolin,
suppresses MKP1 expression through enhancement of
proteasomal degradation in lung cancer cells [28]. Thus,
various mechanisms are involved in regulation of MKP1
expression. Interestingly, we also found that in RIP1
knockdown lung cancer cells, miR-146a was increased,
leading to catalase suppression [40]. Altogether, these
results imply that RIP1 controls different microRNAs
in order to control cancer cells’ response to stresses.
How RIP1 controls these microRNAs’ expression is
currently unclear. It would be interesting to determine if
RIP1-mediated pathways are involved in controlling the
expression of miR-940 or if RIP1 acts as a co-activator

for miR-940 transcription. The latter possibility was
supported by the fact that RIP1 localizes to the nucleus
and RIP1 also regulates transcription of some proteincoding genes [15, 41].
It is of note that while apoptosis induction underlies
one of the major functions of chemotherapeutics, recent
studies highlight that necrotic cell death is also involved in
chemotherapeutic-induced cancer cell death. Some forms
of necrotic cell death in cancer cells depend on formation
of the RIP1-containing complex Ripoptosome, while other
subgroups of necrosis may not involve RIP1 [23, 42, 43].
In addition, there is crosstalk between the apoptosis and
necrosis signaling pathways and the modes of cell death
are cell context- and stimulation-specific [44]. Therefore,
more in depth mechanistic studies are necessary to
investigate the role of RIP1 in cancer cell necrosis, which
will likely lead to potential new adjuvant cancer therapies
for improving chemotherapy efficacy.
In summary, we identify a dual mechanism

for suppressing cisplatin-induced and JNK-mediated
cytotoxicity by RIP1 through releasing miR-940-mediated
MKP1 suppression and inhibiting MKK4 activation. While
further mechanistic studies are warranted, interventions
targeting this RIP1-mediated cytoprotective signaling
pathway may sensitize platinum-based chemotherapy.
