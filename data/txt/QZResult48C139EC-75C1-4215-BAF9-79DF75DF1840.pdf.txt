ABSTRACT
The intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src serves both as a conduit and a regulator
for multiple processes required for the proliferation and survival cancer cells. In
some cancers, Src engages with receptor tyrosine kinases to mediate downstream
signaling and in other cancers, it regulates gene expression. Src therefore represents
a viable oncologic target. However, clinical responses to Src inhibitors, such as
dasatinib have been disappointing to date. We identified Stat3 signaling as a potential
bypass mechanism that enables renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells to escape dasatinib
treatment. Combined Src-Stat3 inhibition using dasatinib and CYT387 (a JAK/STAT
inhibitor) synergistically reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in RCC
cells. Moreover, dasatinib and CYT387 combine to suppress YAP1, a transcriptional
co-activator that promotes cell proliferation, survival and organ size. Importantly,
this combination was well tolerated, and caused marked tumor inhibition in RCC
xenografts. These results suggest that combination therapy with inhibitors of
Stat3 signaling may be a useful therapeutic approach to increase the efficacy of Src
inhibitors.

The most commonly used drugs to treat metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are agents that target VEGF
receptors and those that inhibit mTOR. However,
while most patients initially respond to these agents
the natural history is one of relapse, development of
resistance with subsequent disease progression on
treatment and death [24–26]. Thus, to address the unmet
need to identify additional targets in RCC, our group
and others recently identified Src as a novel therapeutic
target in RCC [27, 28]. Dasatinib alone, however,
was cytostatic and failed to kill RCC cells based on
in vitro and in vivo apoptosis assays [28]. Because

INTRODUCTION
In cancer cells, Src is activated nonmutationally
through its interaction with growth factor receptors and
depending on the context, results in proliferation, survival,
growth, adhesion, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and
metastases [1–6]. Inhibition of Src therefore represents
a promising oncologic therapeutic target and several
agents, such as dasatinib, bosutinib and saracatinib have
been tested in clinical trials. However clinical responses to
these agents have been modest, with rare complete and/or
durable responses [7–23].

of the lack of clinical efficacy of Src inhibitors, our
present study sought to identify additional strategies
that may increase the effectiveness of Src inhibitors,
and importantly reboot the utility of Src inhibitors such
as dasatinib in the clinic.

there are positive Bliss scores across a large range of
concentration for both compounds (Figure 2A). Next we
confirmed our findings using the Chou-Talalay analysis to
test for synergy. Dasatinib and CYT387 combinations in 9
out of 12 cell lines (for example, CAKI-1, ACHN, TK10,
SN12C) demonstrated a combination index (CI) of less
than 1.0, indicating synergy (Figure 2B and Supplementary
Figure S2). Stat3 phosphorylation was inhibited in cell
lines exhibiting synergy to the dasatinib and CYT387
combinations (for example CAKI-1, TK-10, ACHN and
SN12C) as well as those that were additive or antagonistic
(for example UO31 and A498, respectively; Figure 2C).
These findings suggest that, although inhibition of p-Src
and p-Stat3 are clearly necessary, it alone is not sufficient
to predict synergy to the combination therapy.
Moreover, combined treatment with dasatinib
and CYT387 caused a marked increase in apoptosis
in the majority of RCC cells in the panel compared
to dasatinib alone (Figure 2D). Together, these data
demonstrate that Stat3 inhibition enhanced the effects
of dasatinib in RCC cells.

RESULTS
Combined inhibition of Src and Stat3 enhances
Src pathway inhibition
Pre-clinical studies in a wide variety of solid
tumors have shown that dasatinib is primarily cytostatic,
and this is consistent with the clinical experience, where
dasatinib activity is associated with stable disease but
complete responses are rarely observed [7–23, 28–33].
Consistent with this, we observed that physiologically
relevant doses of dasatinib (~100nM) was effective in
reducing the proliferation of the majority of the RCC
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1) [34, 35]. We
hypothesized that the purely cytostatic response observed
with Src inhibition alone results from bypass survival
signaling pathways present in cancer cells that override
the therapeutic benefit of dasatinib. Because Stat3 is a
known mediator of survival signaling downstream of Src,
we decided to test this hypothesis by examining the effect
of dasatinib on the levels of phosphorylated Stat3 (hence,
activation) [4]. We observed that dasatinib effectively
suppressed phosphorylation of Src and its substrate FAK
at low concentrations (i.e. 25–100 nM, Figure 1A and
Figure 2C). Surprisingly, dasatinib failed to abrogate the
phosphorylation of Stat3 in all of the cell lines in our
panel, and in some cell lines resulted in higher levels of
Stat3 phosphorylation (for example TK10 and SN12C).
Stat3 has been shown to promote cell survival and induce
drug resistance in cancer cells [34, 36–39]. Together,
these findings suggest that although dasatinib effectively
dephosphorylates Src, there is persistence of Stat3
signaling, which may mediate dasatinib-independent
survival signals.
To test the role of Stat3 in overriding dasatinib
inhibition, we treated the RCC cells with CYT387
(Momelotinub ®), a JAK-STAT inhibitor that is currently
in clinical trials for myeloproliferative neoplasia [40].
Accordingly, CYT387 treatment led to suppression
of Stat3 phosphorylation in RCC cells (Figure 1B).
We next determined whether the co-targeting of Src
and Stat3 exhibited synergistic activity in RCC cancer
cells by treating each of the cell lines with increasing
concentrations of dasatinib and CYT387 alone and in
combination. We used a dose matrix to sample a large
range of concentrations and concentration ratios and
analyzed combination effects using the Bliss independence
model [41]. Positive Bliss scores indicate combination
effects where the effect is greater than additive. The
heatmaps for CAKI-1, TK-10 and ACHN show that

Combined inhibition of Src and Stat3 reduces
tumor growth
We next examined the safety and efficacy of
inhibiting Src and Stat3 in vivo in two xenograft tumor
models. While dasatinib or CYT387 alone exhibited
anti-tumor effect on CAKI-1 and ACHN xenografts,
the combination of dasatinib with CYT387 resulted
in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition (71%
TGI) in CAKI-1 and (48% TGI) in ACHN tumor
xenografts (p < 0.001; Figure 3A and 3B, respectively).
Importantly, combination treatment was well tolerated,
with no weight loss recorded (Figure 3C and 3D,
respectively). Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated
that combination therapy led to the suppression of Stat3
and Src phosphorylation (Figure 3E and 3F, respectively).
Consistent with our prior finding, dasatinib alone had
minimal impact on apoptosis [28]. In marked contrast,
combination treatment with dasatinib and CYT387
resulted in significant increase in apoptosis (demonstrated
by increase in cleaved-caspase3, p < 0.001; Figure 3G)
and reduction in proliferation (demonstrated by decrease
in Ki-67, p < 0.001; Figure 3H). Therefore, prolonged
inhibition of Src and Stat3 signaling by combining
dasatinib and CYT387 is associated with enhanced
inhibition of tumor growth with good tolerability.

Dasatinib and CYT arrests YAP1 transcriptional
programs

subsequently synergy to the dasatinib and CYT387

that achieved in synergistic cell lines (Figure 2C, 2D).
These findings suggest that despite on-target inhibition
by dasatinib and CYT387, suppression of Src and Stat3
activation are not sufficient to predict sensitivity to this
combination. To identify potential signaling pathways
downstream of combined dasatinib+CYT387 treatment
that have greater fidelity for predicting synergistic
response, we performed reverse phase protein array
(RPPA) analysis and the fold changes were translated to
a z-score (see Methods). Strikingly, we observed that the
levels of phosphorylated Serine 127-YAP1 (Yes-associated
protein 1) increased by approximately 6- and 2-fold in the
combination treatment compared to vehicle control in
ACHN and SN12C cells, respectively (Figure 4A).
Phosphorylation at Ser127 of YAP1 results in its
sequestration in the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation.

YAP1 regulates several context-specific transcriptional
programs that promotes tumor proliferation, survival and
organ growth, and is an effector of the canonical Hippo
signaling pathway that comprises a cascade of kinases that
includes the Hippo/MST1–2 kinases, the adaptor Sav1,
and the LATS1/2 kinases [42]. When the Hippo signaling
is turned on, it culminates in the phosphorylation and
consequent inactivation of the transcriptional co-activators
YAP1 and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding
motif (TAZ) by LATS1/2, which suppresses the TEA
domain-containing sequence-specific transcription factors
(TEADs)-dependent expression of a network of genes
that promote cell proliferation and survival. Studies in
mouse models have shown that YAP1 functions as an
oncogene [43, 44]. The increase in p-Ser127YAP1 levels

DISCUSSION

to the dasatinib-CYT387 combination, was confirmed
through Western blot analysis (Figure 4B). Notably,
the combination of dasatinib and CYT387 in ACHN
and SN12C cells induced greater phosphorylation of
Ser127YAP1 than either drug alone, indicating that
CYT387 and dasatinib affect YAP1 via a parallel pathway.
In contrast, p-Ser127YAP1 levels did not increase in
RXF393 cells, which exhibit antagonism to, and are
resistant to apoptosis when co-treated with dasatinib and
CYT387 (Figure 2B and 2D).
To further investigate the transcriptional responses
to YAP1 inactivation, we analyzed the RNA sequencing
(RNA-Seq) profiles of ACHN cells treated with dasatinib
and CYT387 (Figure 4C). Consistent with the decrease in
YAP1 activation, we observed an increase in YAP1 gene
targets that encode for inhibition of the cell cycle, such as
CDKN1A and CDKN1B; and similarly, a decrease in those
that encode for cell cycle progression, such as CDK1, with
the combination therapy of dasatinib and CYT387 having
greater effect on gene expression than either drug alone
[45]. The gain in CDKN1B (p27) transcripts in ACHN cells
with dasatinib and CYT387 co-treatment corresponded
with an increase at the protein level (Figure 4D).
Then in a cohort of 499 patients from the TCGA
RCC dataset [46], we found that high levels of YAP1 and
TAZ transcripts itself, as well as its regulated genes CDK1,
AURKA, AURKB, CCNB1 and CCNB1 are associated with
poor prognosis (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure S3).
Next, using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA),
we evaluated two canonical transcriptional signatures
of YAP1-dependent genes in ACHN cells treated with
dasatinib and CYT387 compared to vehicle [47].
Remarkably, the genes downregulated by YAP1 knockdown
[48] were significantly enriched by dasatinib and CYT387
combination treatment (Normalized Enrichment Score
= +1.84, where positive values indicate correlation;
P = 0.023; False Discovery Rate = 0.069) (Figure 4F).
Correspondingly, the genes that are positively regulated by
YAP1 [49] were downregulated and significantly enriched
by dasatinib and CYT387 combination treatment (NES
= –3.14, where negative values indicate anticorrelation;
P = 0.0; FDR = 0.0) (Figure 4G), suggesting a strong
correlation with YAP1 transcriptional signatures and Src
and Stat3 inhibition.
Next, we performed GSEA on the entire Molecular
Signature Database (MSigDB: C2 canonical pathway
dataset). Genesets related to inhibition of cell cycle,
transcription and translation were significantly enriched in
the dasatinib and CYT 387 co-treatment suppressed genes
(Figure 4H and Supplementary Table S1). Specifically,
biological modules associated with YAP1 (e.g. cell cycle
checkpoints, synthesis of DNA) were also anticorrelated
with dasatinib and CYT387 co-treatment. Together, these
data support the observation that Src and Stat3 inhibition
confers a selective repression of transcriptional networks
induced by YAP1.

The goal of the present study was to identify
ways to improve the initial responses to Src inhibitors.
Since Src functions primarily as a signaling rheostat, we
hypothesized that Src is best targeted in combination
with agents that inhibit molecules that signal through,
or engage with it. We observed that dasatinib potently
inhibited Src signaling, as demonstrated by suppressed
Src and FAK phosphorylation but that the activity of Stat3
persisted, probably through input from other pathways.
Cumulative evidence supports activation of Stat3 as an
oncogenic pathway in many cancers, including RCC
[36, 50–53]. Importantly, persistent activation of Stat3
has been implicated in conferring resistance to some
anticancer drugs [36, 37, 54, 55]. Stat3 activation
potentiates both proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling
and is associated with chemoresistance. In addition,
studies in head and neck and non-small cell lung cancer
cells have shown reactivation of Stat3 signaling in the
presence of dasatinib, indicating that these cancers have
become resistant to dasatinib by finding a way to sustain
Stat3 signaling [37, 56].
Since developing drugs that target transcription
factors such as Stat3 has so far been challenging, small
molecule JAK inhibitors represent a plausible clinical
alternative to block Stat3 signaling. [36, 39, 55, 57]. We
demonstrated that full suppression of Stat3 activation
was achieved with the addition of a JAK inhibitor,
CYT387. Importantly, CYT387 synergized with dasatinib
in cell lines and in mouse xenografts models to inhibit
proliferation, induce apoptosis and suppress tumor growth.
An unexpected finding was the pronounced and
concordant increase in Ser127YAP1 phosphorylation by
dasatinib and CYT38 with the subsequent suppression
of multiple YAP1-dependent transcriptional signatures.
Previous reports have documented a role for Yes1
(a Src family kinase member) in phosphorylating
Y357YAP1, which results in its nuclear localization and
transcriptional activation, which was then inhibited by
the addition of dasatinib [58]. While the mechanism(s)
mediating an increase in the serine-127 phosphorylation
of YAP1 and thereby preventing its nuclear translocation
is unknown, it may suggest that both dasatinib and
CYT387 positively impact the Hippo signaling cascade
with resultant inhibition of cell proliferation and growth.
These observations are compatible with the known role of
YAP1 as transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation and
tumor cell survival and importantly, the RNA-Seq analysis
of YAP1 target genes in the TCGA RCC dataset suggests
that several YAP1-TAZ regulated genes are associated
with poor prognosis of RCC patients.
In summary, we observed synergistic activity
with dasatinib and CYT387, and these findings point
to a strategy to potentially improve the efficacy of Src
inhibitors by co-treatment with Stat3 inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blotting

Cell lines

Cells were plated in 6 well dishes and treated the
following day with the indicated agents. Treatments
were for 24 hours, after which cells were washed with
ice cold PBS and, unless otherwise indicated, lysed with
Additionally, 0.5 mM DTT, 4 μg/mL leupeptin, 4 μg/
mL pepstatin, 4 μg/mL aprotinin, RIPA buffer (Sigma).
Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set II and protease
inhibitor cocktail set III (EMD Millipore) were added
at the time of lysis. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000g
x 10 min at 4 degrees C. Protein concentrations were
calculated based on a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific)
generated standard curve. Proteins were resolved
using the NuPAGE Novex Mini Gel system on 4% to
12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen). For western blotting,
equal amounts of cell lysates (15–20  μg of protein)
were resolved with SDS-PAGE, and transferred
to membranes. The membrane was probed with
primary antibodies, washed, and then incubated with
corresponding fluorescent secondary antibodies and
washed. The fluorescent signal was captured using
LI-COR (Lincoln, NE) Odyssey Imaging System, and
fluorescent intensity was quantified using the Odyssey
software where indicated. The following antibodies
were used for Western blots: p-Src (Y416), Src, p-Fak
(Y576/577), Fak, Jak2, p-YAP1 (S127), and YAP1 (Cell
Signaling Technologies). p-Jak2 (Y1007/1008), pStat3
(Y705), Stat3 and β-actin (AC15) (Abcam). Ki67 (Dako)
and cleaved caspase3 (Cell Signaling Technologies)
were used for immunohistochemistry. Dasatinib and
CYT387 for in vitro and in vivo use were purchased
from LC Labs and ChemieTek, respectively.

ACHN, A498, Caki-1, RCC4, RCC10, RXF393,
SN12C, TK-10, U031, 786–0 were used in this study
and were obtained from the ATCC. RCC10+VHL and
786+VHL were stably transfected with wild type VHL.
Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

Cell viability and apoptosis analysis
Cell viability assays were performed by plating
3*103 cells/well in 24-well plates in triplicate and
treating the following day with the indicated agent. The
experiment was continued for 5 days and then the cells
were fixed using 4% formaldehyde and stained for 1 hour
with Syto60. Fluorescence was measured and quantified
and photographs were obtained using a LiCor Odyssey
Infrared Imager. Experimental results are the average of
at least three independent experiments.
Apoptosis was determined using Caspase 3/7Glo assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 1 × 103 cells per well were plated
in 96 well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cells were
treated with dasatinib, CYT387 and the combination
of dasatinib and CYT387 for –72 h, and then 100 μl
reagents were added to each well and incubated for
30 min at room temperature. Caspase 3/7 activity
was measured using a luminometer. Luminescence
values were normalized by cell numbers. The effect
of dasatinib, CYT387 and the dasatinib+CYT387
combination on caspase 3/7 activation was assessed as
fold of DMSO-treated control cells.

In vivo xenograft studies
4–6 week old mice were utilized for human renal
cell carcinoma xenografts. For both ACHN and Caki-1
cell lines 1 × 106 cells were diluted in 50 μl of PBS and
50 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and were injected
subcutaneously into the right and left flank of each
mouse.
Tumors were monitored until they reached an
average size of 50–80 mm3 (approximately 2 weeks), at
which point treatments were begun. Dasatinib (25 mg/
kg/day) and CYT387 (50 mg/kg/day) were administered
by oral gavage 5 day/week. Dasatinib was dissolved in
1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, sigma)/ Propylene glycol
(Sigma) and CYT387 was dissolved in NMP/Captisol
(Cydex). Tumors and mouse weights were measured
twice weekly. At least 6–8 mice per treatment group were
included. All mice were euthanized using CO2 inhala­
tion followed by cervical dislocation per institutional
guidelines at Oregon Health and Science University.
Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at OHSU.

Drug combination studies
Cells were seeded in 384-well plates at 500 cells/
well. After 24 hours, cells were treated with dasatinib
(dose range of 0–400 nM) and CYT387 (dose range of
0–3.5 μM) in a 10 by 5 matrix. Cells were treated for
120 hours, and ATP was determined with CellTiter-Glo
(Promega). Dasatinib IC50 values were calculated from the
6 single-agent doses using a 3-parameter fit with XLFit
(IDBS). The Bliss expectation was calculated with the
equation (A+B) - (A*B), where A and B are the fractional
growth inhibitions induced by agents A and B at a given
dose. The difference between Bliss expectation and
observed growth inhibition induced by the combination
of agents A and B is the “Bliss scores”. “Bliss sum” is the
sum of all Bliss scores in a given matrix. Combination
indices (CI) were calculated using Calcusyn software.
A CI value less than 1.0 is represents a synergistic drug
combination.

Immunohistochemistry studies

phosphoproteins with a z-score of > 1.96 or <–1.96 in
both cell lines were selected. The fold change values
were visualized by generating the heatmap using MeV
software (http://www.tm4.org/mev. html).

Immunostaining was performed following depara­
ffinization and rehydration of the slides, antigen retrieval
was performed in a pressure cooker using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for 4 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min at room
temperature and nonspecific binding was blocked using
10% normal horse serum for 30 min at room temperature.
Samples were incubated at room temperature with
p-Y416Src rabbit monoclonal antibody (Y416), cleaved
caspase 3, p-Y705Stat3 and Ki67. Slides were developed
with Vector Immpress rabbit IgG (#MP7401) and Vector
Immpress mouse IgG (#MP7400) for 30 min at room
temperature. Chromogenic detection was performed
using Vector Immpact DAB (#SK4105) for 3 min. Sides
were counterstained with hematoxylin. A 3DHistech
MIDI Scanner (Perkin Elmer) was used to capture whole
slide digital images with a 20x objective. Images were
converted to into MRXS files and computer graphic
analysis was completed using inForm 1.4.0 Advanced
Image Analysis Software (Perkin Elmer).

RNA Seq analysis
Total RNA was extracted from ACHN cells treated
with 50nM of dasatinib and 2uM of CYT387, alone,
in combination or DMSO for 24 hours. Total RNA
was extracted with Trizol/CHCl3 (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The aqueous
phase was put through the Qiagen RNEasy kit for cleanup.
Sample preparation followed the Agilent SureSelect
Strand-Specific mRNA Library Preparation Protocol
(Version A.2, September 2013, Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). Poly-A RNA was purified from
1ug total RNA per sample using two serial rounds of
binding to oligo dT magnetic beads. The poly(A) RNA
was chemically-fragmented and first-stand cDNA was
synthesized using the RNA Seq First Strand Master
Mix (Agilent). After purifying the first strand cDNA
using AMPure XP beads, second-strand cDNA was
synthesized and ends were repaired. A second round of
cDNA purification with AMPure XP beads occurred, the
3′ ends were adenylated, followed by adapter ligation and
AMPure XP beads purification. Ligated DNA was PCR
amplified for 14 cycles and purified again with AMPure
XP beads. Quality of the resulting libraries was assessed
with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Assay.
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina (San Diego,
CA) HiSeq as single-end 50bp reads. Sequence data are
available at Gene Expression Omnibus with accession
number pending.
Fastq files were re-aligned to the human genome
GRCh37.70 with the subjunc function in the Subread
package allowing for 5 bp indels and all possible
junctions [60]. Reads were assigned to genes and counted
using the Featurecounts function of subread [61]. The
aligned reads are summarized over exons to obtain
number of reads mapping to each union exon (count data)
using a custom python script. First, a GTF formatted
annotation file is parsed to create union exon ranges.
Secondly, the exon boundaries and an alignment in SAM
format were read and the number of reads falling in each
of the defined exonic regions was counted. Samples
were investigated for anomalies or differences that
would preclude incorporation in to the final dataset using
custom scripts in the R statistical programming language
(http://www.R-project.org). Very lowly expressed tags
i.e. tags which have fewer than 5 counts in total were
excluded. Different samples might be sequenced with
different depths or depending on the tissue type some
genes may be highly expressed. To account for this the
count data is normalized using the upper quartile method

Statistical analysis
Mouse tumor size was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA
with time and drug as factors, using GraphPad Prism.
Mouse weight during treatment was analyzed by repeated
measures 2-way ANOVA, with time and drug as factors.
A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Immunohistochemistry: P-values were
calculated using one-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni’s
multiple comparison test. * denotes P < 0.05, ** denotes
P < 0.01, and *** denotes P < 0.001.

Reverse phase protein array
Cell lines were either treated with DMSO, 100
nM dasatinib, 2 μM CYT387, or the combination of
dasatinib and CYT387 for 24 h. Lysates were prepared
as recommended by MD Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, Texas, USA), arrayed on nitrocellulosecoated slides, probed for a standard list of antibodies
at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and results were
quantified and normalized using their procedure [59].
Genes with insufficient signal were filtered out. From
the quantile normalized RPPA data, the fold change
values were calculated (the ratio of drug treated above
the vehicle treated) for three treatments: dasatinib,
CYT387 and combination of dasatinib+CYT387. We
calculated the z-score for the protein fold changes
from the RPPA data. Z-scores were calculated from the
log2 fold change values. Z-score = (log2 fold change
of protein—mean of log2 fold changes of all proteins
of the array) / standard deviation of log2 fold changes
of all proteins of the array. We applied a z-score
cutoff of ± 1.96 for the both cell lines. The proteins/

that adjusts the top 75th percentile across all samples
(R package EdgeR, http://www.bioconductor.org).
TCGA KIRC data was stratified by YAP1 and TAZ
mRNA expression using the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal
platform (http://cbioportal.org).

This study was supported by NIH grants R01
CA169172, P30 CA069533 and P30 CA069533 13S5
through OHSU-Knight Cancer Institute, The Hope
Foundation (SWOG), OTRADI and Kure It Cancer
Research (G.V. T).

Gene set enrichment analysis
Normalized counts/million (cpm) values from
RNAseq data were used for calculating the fold change
values using the vehicle treated sample as reference. The
fold change values for 1.5-fold regulated genes were used
for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the Preranked option (GSEA-P) in GSEA v2.1.0 software as
described in [47]. Analysis was performed on C2-canonical
pathways defined in MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/msigdb/genesets.jsp?collection=CP) with a
weighted enrichment statistic. One thousand permutations
of the data were completed to obtain an FDR q value.
Significance was defined as having an FDR q value < 0.25.
GSEA was performed independently for three treatments,
i.e.: dasatinib, CYT387 and dasatinib+CYT387 and
significant genesets were compared.
To specifically look at effect of combination
treatment on YAP1, we performed GSEA analysis
focusing on YAP1 targets. We defined three genesets as
readouts for YAP1 activity:
1)“REACTOME_YAP1_AND_WWTR1_TAZ_
STIMULATED_GENE_EXPRESSION” defined as genes
involved in YAP1- and WWTR1 (TAZ)-stimulated gene
expression from MSigDB,
2)“YAP1_TARGETS_AVNISHKAPOOR” defined
as genes upregulated in YAP1 overexpressing mouse
pancreatic tumors [49] and, 3) “YAP1_TARGETS_
DIANE_SHAO” defined as genes downregulated in
HCTtetK cells stably expressing YAP1 (data from
GSE55942) as described in [48].
For YAP1, we performed GSEA analysis on all the
genes from the RNAseq data using phenotype permutation
with a weighted enrichment statistic and a signal-to-noise
metric for ranking genes.
