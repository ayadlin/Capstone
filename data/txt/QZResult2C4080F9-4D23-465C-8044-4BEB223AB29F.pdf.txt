The Evolution of Melanoma Resistance Reveals Therapeutic
Opportunities
Meghna Das Thakur and Darrin D. Stuart

Abstract
The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway is a key driver of proliferation and survival signals in tumor cells and has
been the focus of intense drug development efforts over the past 20 years. The recent regulatory approval of RAF
inhibitors and a MAP–ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor for metastatic melanoma provides clinical validation of tumor
dependency on this pathway. Unfortunately, the therapeutic beneﬁt of these agents is often short lived and
resistance develops within a matter of months. Preclinical models of resistance to vemurafenib have provided
critical insights into predicting, validating, and characterizing potential mechanisms. A key observation has been
that vemurafenib-resistant tumor cells suffer a ﬁtness deﬁcit in the absence of drug treatment and this led to the
predication that modulating the selective pressure of drug treatment through intermittent dosing could delay or
prevent the emergence of resistant tumors. Most importantly, the preclinical data are supported by observations
in vemurafenib-treated patients with melanoma providing a strong rationale for clinical testing of alternative
dosing regimens. Cancer Res; 73(20); 6106–10. Ó2013 AACR.

Introduction
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway transmits proliferation
and survival signals from cell surface receptors to the cytoplasm and nucleus. In tumor cells this pathway is frequently
hyperactivated through constitutive activation of upstream
growth factor receptors or through mutations in RAS or BRAF.
In melanoma, approximately 10% to 15% of tumors express a
mutant, constitutively active form of NRAS and approximately
50% express mutant BRAF, with a T to A substitution at codon
1799 (BRAFV600E) being the most frequent mutation. A deep
body of preclinical evidence supports the oncogenic role of
mutant RAS and mutant BRAF in melanoma (reviewed in
refs. 1, 2).
The frequency of oncogenic mutations in this pathway has
led to intense efforts to develop inhibitors to RAS, RAF, MAP–
ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK). Preclinical proof of concept for targeting MEK in cells
expressing mutant BRAF came from Solit and colleagues who
showed that tumor cells expressing BRAFV600E were more
sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with cells expressing
wild-type BRAF and RAS (3). These ﬁndings were subsequently
conﬁrmed with selective RAF inhibitors, which displayed an
even greater differential impact on tumor cells expressing
BRAFV600E and a so-called "genetic therapeutic index" (4, 5).
This led to the clinical development of selective RAF inhibitors

such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and LGX818, which preferentially inhibit the phosphorylation of MEK in cells expressing
the BRAFV600 mutation. In phase III clinical trials in patients
with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, the response rates to
vemurafenib and dabrafenib were approximately 50%, with
both agents providing signiﬁcant increases in progression-free
survival and overall survival for vemurafenib compared with
dacarbazine (6, 7). MEK inhibitors have also recently shown
signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in this disease, however, the response rates
seem to be lower than for RAF inhibitors (8, 9). A unique
pharmacologic feature of RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib
is that they induce paradoxical activation of the RAF–MEK–
ERK pathway in cells expressing wild-type BRAF, rather than
suppression, as is the case with MEK inhibitors (10–12). This
leads to unique and sometimes counteracting toxicities with
RAF and MEK inhibitors in human patients, ultimately allowing RAF inhibitors to achieve a higher degree of pathway
suppression in tumors with BRAFV600E mutations.

Reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
Pathway in Resistance Tumors
Although the efﬁcacy of RAF inhibitors in metastatic melanoma represents a signiﬁcant improvement over previous
therapies, the vast majority of patients are not cured and
patients relapse with lethal, drug-resistant disease within a
few months. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance is crucial to develop strategies for preventing resistance
using drug combinations, new drugs, or as the authors propose,
alternative dosing schedules for existing drugs (13). There is a
wide range of mechanisms that could mediate resistance to
RAF inhibitors and recent publications have described several
possibilities. For example, activating NRAS mutations (Q61K
and Q61R) have been discovered in vemurafenib-resistant
melanoma tumors (14, 15). That NRAS mutations are mutually

exclusive of BRAFV600E in treatment-na€ve tumors, coupled
with the knowledge that vemurafenib is ineffective in RASactivated tumor cells builds a strong case for activating NRAS
mutations as a mechanism of resistance. Although drug-resistant mutations that impair drug binding have not been discovered in the BRAF gene itself, ampliﬁcation, overexpression,
or expression of splice variants of BRAF have all been described as mechanisms of resistance (13, 15, 16). Similarly, CRAF
overexpression has been shown to drive resistance to RAF
inhibitors in preclinical models (17, 18). Other possibilities
include COT overexpression and MEK mutation (e.g.,
MEK1C121S) as mechanisms that lead to MEK activation
independent of BRAFV600E (18, 19). The very nature of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway wiring and control
through negative feedback provides the opportunity for adaptive resistance, whereby RAF inhibitors block ERK signaling
leading to the release of ERK-dependent negative feedback,
resulting in reactivation of ligand-dependent signaling, which
is normally muted in BRAFV600E cells (20–22). The commonality among these mechanisms is that they all lead to reactivation of ERK, suggesting that resistant tumor cells maintain
their dependency on the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and this is
consistent with the central role of this pathway in proliferation
and survival of melanoma tumor cells. Finally, results from a
recent phase II study comparing single-agent RAF inhibitor
with RAF plus MEK inhibitor combination indicate that the
combination provided longer progression-free survival, suggesting that stronger, more potent blockade of the pathway
delays the emergence of resistance (23). A consistent and
critical observation is that drug-resistant mutations in BRAF
that impair drug binding have not been observed, suggesting
that the drug is still inhibiting BRAFV600E and the resistant cells
have used one or more of the mechanisms described earlier to
compensate for the inhibitor and reactivate the pathway (24).
However, mechanisms of resistance that do not result in
reactivation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway have been proposed and could also occur (25).

Resistant Tumors Are Less Fit in the Absence of
Drug Treatment
In an attempt to model vemurafenib resistance, we used
human melanoma patient-derived xenografts (PDX), which are
propagated by serial transplantation in immunocompromised
mice, with the goal of maintaining the heterogeneity of the
original human tumor (13). As expected, these models respond
to vemurafenib treatment in a dose-dependent manner, with
tumor regression observed at a clinically relevant dose. However, consistent with human clinical data, continuous longterm vemurafenib treatment led to the development of drugresistant tumors. Interrogation of the underlying mechanism
of resistance led to the identiﬁcation of ampliﬁcation and/or
overexpression of BRAFV600E, which was further validated as a
mechanism by siRNA knockdown in vitro using a cell line
derived from the resistant PDX. An interesting observation is
that only one out of nine of the resistant tumors ampliﬁed the
BRAFV600E gene (8 copies), whereas the remaining eight
tumors simply overexpressed the gene. This is despite the fact

www.aacrjournals.org

that all of the resistant tumors were all derived from one
founder resistant tumor, providing further evidence of the
heterogeneity within this PDX model.
The most striking observation from these studies was that
both resistant tumors in vivo and cell lines derived from
resistant tumors seemed to be dependent on continued exposure to vemurafenib—upon drug withdrawal, resistant tumors
transiently regressed and cell lines grew more slowly. This
phenomenon was also observed in an in vitro derived vemurafenib-resistant cell line expressing the BRAFV600E p61 splice
variant as well as a PDX derived from a vemurafenib-resistant
patient in which the mechanism of resistance was unknown.
Therefore, it seems that vemurafenib-resistant tumors experience a ﬁtness deﬁcit upon cessation of drug treatment and
the method used to generate cell lines from the resistant
tumors provided a clue. To effectively establish vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, we had to grow the cells in the presence
of vemurafenib. The dose-response of these cells to vemurafenib followed a bell-shaped curve with a peak rate of proliferation observed at 40 nmol/L vemurafenib. Intriguingly, this
correlated very closely with the concentration of vemurafenib
required to normalize pERK to the same level as the parental
drug-sensitive cells. Therefore, it seems that melanoma tumor
cells require a speciﬁc, set level of activated ERK for optimal
growth. This was directly shown through the overexpression of
ectopic BRAFV600E, which led to decreased proliferation in a
cell line derived from the PDX model. The effect of vemurafenib
treatment on resistant tumor cell growth was also described by
Tap and colleagues (26). Strikingly, this drug dependency was
also observed in vivo in the resistant PDX tumors, which
regressed upon vemurafenib cessation, and serial biopsies
from each tumor following drug withdrawal indicated that
pERK levels spiked, leading to regression or decrease in tumor
growth. Although the mechanism linking pathway hyperactivation and tumor regression has not been determined, previous studies have shown that RAF–MEK–ERK hyperactivation
can lead to cell-cycle arrest and senescence (27–29).
A key question is, to what degree do these observations
made in preclinical models translate into human patients with
vemurafenib-resistant disease. Fisher and colleagues found
that tumor growth rates decreased when comparing relapse
computed tomography (CT) scans with the postrelapse CT
scan in 14 out of 19 vemurafenib-resistant patients following
cessation of treatment (30). A signiﬁcant challenge to gathering such data retrospectively is that postrelapse CT scans were
not controlled for time post-vemurafenib withdrawal and were
not collected at multiple time points, so minor or transient
changes in tumor-growth kinetics may have been missed.
These data provide evidence that vemurafenib-resistant
human tumors have the same drug-dependency as observed
in preclinical models. However, it should be noted that in the
same study, postrelapse scans were not available for 16
patients due to rapid progressive disease, indicating that
decreases in tumor growth rate following drug withdrawal
may not be a universal phenomenon. Nonetheless, the observations that some human melanoma tumors experience
decreases in growth rate upon cessation of RAF inhibitor
treatment is consistent with our preclinical results and

suggests that resistant tumors can suffer a ﬁtness deﬁcit in the
absence of drug treatment. This phenotypic evidence is further
supported by the genetic basis for resistance in some patients;
activating NRAS mutations are mutually exclusive with respect
to BRAFV600E and only exist under the selective pressure of
drug treatment (31).
The biology underlying these preclinical and clinical observations seem to follow basic evolutionary processes: tumor
cells evolve to overcome inhibition of an oncogene-driven
pathway through the selection of mutations or adaptations
that result in a ﬁtness disadvantage in the absence of drug treatment, leading to repopulation of cells with a drug-sensitive
phenotype. The genetic and molecular heterogeneity within
tumors provide the basis for plasticity and adaptation under
the selective pressure of drug treatment and the rationale for
alternative dosing regimens; however, this heterogeneity (especially intertumor) and polygenic nature of drug resistance is
likely to complicate the relatively simple model proposed by
our preclinical studies. With multiple potential resistance
mechanisms at play within or across tumors within a given
patient, drug resistance becomes a "moving target." Tracking
clonal evolution by developing sensitive methods to detect the
relevant clones and using noninvasive techniques for measuring tumor burden and heterogeneity such as circulating DNA
or protein biomarkers from plasma will be critical to design
optimal treatment regimens in the future.
Given the fundamental nature of the biologic features of
vemurafenib described earlier, drug dependency may be
expected to occur in other tumors treated with agents targeting driver oncogenes. Indeed, chronic myelogenous leukemias
(CML) develop resistance to imatinib through the expression
of the drug-resistant mutations in BCR-ABL (e.g., T315I). The

prevalence of these mutations has been shown to decrease
when drug treatment is suspended, leading to the repopulation
of drug-sensitive clones, which can result in a second response
to imatinib treatment (32). Similar results have been described
in studies of EGF receptor (EGFR) mutant non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR inhibitors. In preclinical
studies, long-term treatment of drug-sensitive NSCLC cell lines
with EGFR inhibitors led to resistance through expression of
the drug-resistant T790M mutation in EGFR (33). These drugresistant cells grew slower compared with parental cells and
when grown through several passages in the absence of drug,
the frequency of the T790M mutation decreased dramatically
and the cells reverted to a drug-sensitive phenotype (33). These
results are mirrored by clinical observations in patients with
NSCLC who have developed resistance to EGFR therapy. As
part of a larger translational science study, Sequist and colleagues collected serial biopsies from three patients with
NSCLC and found that the T790M mutation (n ¼ 2) or a
PIK3CA mutation (n ¼ 1) appeared in tumors that developed
resistance to erlotinib, however, these mutations were not
detected upon rebiopsy of the same tumors 7 to 10 months
after treatment was stopped and the patients experienced a
second response to erlotinib (34).

Intermittent Dosing Can Forestall Resistance
These data led to the hypothesis that an intermittent
treatment schedule in which the selective pressure of vemurafenib treatment is applied and withdrawn would prevent or
delay the emergence of a resistant tumor cell population
(Fig. 1). Experimental results in two different PDX models
using either 4 weeks on/2 weeks off vemurafenib or an individualized regimen conﬁrmed that tumors regressed upon

Resistant tumor cells may preexist at a low frequency in treatment-naïve melanoma tumors (as shown) or may arise from the general tumor cell
population. In either case, drug-sensitive cells make up a signiﬁcant proportion of the tumor as evidenced by the tumor regression upon drug treatment in the
majority of patients. Continued treatment leads to the enrichment or evolution of a resistant population of tumor cells that will expand on continued
treatment. However, suspension of drug treatment removes the selective advantage gained by resistant cells and leads to repopulation by drug-sensitive
cells. Repeated cycles of drug treatment followed by drug-free intervals will delay the emergence of drug-resistance. Tx, treatment.

Evolution of Resistance Reveals Therapeutic Opportunities

drug treatment and regrew after a short delay following
suspension of treatment. Repeated cycles of vemurafenib
treatment using these regimens controlled tumor growth over
the course of 7 months of treatment, whereas mice treated on
a continuous cycle developed resistance as soon as 2 months
after initiation of therapy.
Although our current knowledge of the biology underlying
vemurafenib resistance, coupled with these preclinical proofof-concept studies provide a strong rationale to investigate
alternative dosing regimens in human patients with melanoma, many aspects still need to be addressed such as deﬁning
optimized regimens. In one of the PDX models, we evaluated
an individualized regimen that was facilitated by the ease of
measurement of subcutaneous tumor dimensions using calipers. However, in patients with melanoma, repeated measures
of tumor volume may be less feasible due to cost or safety
concerns (e.g., CT) and indirect measures of tumor burden may
be required as described earlier. Furthermore, in the preclinical
models, only one tumor was evaluated in each mouse, whereas
in patients with melanoma, it may be more challenging to
adjust dosing schedules based on the growth of multiple
metastatic lesions.
Despite these questions, evidence already exists in human
patients with melanoma that some form of intermittent
dosing of a RAF inhibitor may be effective. For example,
Seghers and colleagues describe two patients who were
successfully rechallenged with a RAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) or a RAF inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor combination
(dabrafenib plus trametinib) following a treatment-free
period after previously progressing on a RAF inhibitor
(dabrafenib) or the dabrafenib plus trametinib combination
(35). Consistent with these data, we have observed that RAF
inhibitor resistant melanoma xenograft tumors grown
through three generations in the absence of drug treatment
respond upon rechallenge with the RAF inhibitor (unpublished results). These data are consistent with the hypothesis
that drug-resistant tumor cells have a selective disadvantage
in the absence of drug treatment leading to repopulation of
drug-sensitive cells during a drug holiday.
Direct evidence supporting that an intermittent dosing
schedule could work in human patients with melanoma comes
from a recent case study (36). As discussed earlier, RAF
inhibitors such as vemurafenib induce "paradoxical activation"
of ERK signaling in a RAS-dependent manner and this contributes to the induction of keratoacanthomas and cutaneous
squamous-cell carcinomas (37). Callahan and colleagues
described a melanoma patient in which vemurafenib induced
proliferation of a previously undetected NRAS-mutant chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (36). Although the patient's mela-

noma initially responded to vemurafenib, treatment was
stopped in an attempt to slow the growth of the leukemia.
Consistent decrease in white cell counts over the following
2 weeks allowed the reinitiation of vemurafenib. However,
vemurafenib treatment resulted in rising white cell counts.
Thus, the patient was subsequently treated using an adjusted
schedule guided by changes in white cell counts. Over the
course of 5 months, white cell counts were controlled by
stopping and restarting vemurafenib treatment and a partial
tumor response was maintained in the melanoma tumors. The
patient has continued on an intermittent schedule for over 80
weeks (Paul Chapman, personal communication).

Conclusions and Future Directions
The development of potent, selective inhibitors of oncogenic
drivers such as BCR-ABL, mutant EGFR, and BRAFV600E have
revolutionized cancer therapy but have also provided critical
insights into tumor biology that were not apparent under
treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The development of
resistance to these agents seems to follow basic evolutionary
principles. In the case of BCR-ABLþ CML or EGFR-mutant
NSCLC, the fraction of tumor cells expressing mutations that
confer resistance to their respective inhibitors ﬂuctuates with
and without the selective pressure of drug treatment, suggesting that these clones are less ﬁt than tumor cells not expressing
these mutations. In the case of BRAFV600E melanoma, target
mutations do not seem to confer resistance to RAF inhibitors
and the pathway is reactivated through other mechanisms that
cause a signiﬁcant selective disadvantage in the absence of
drug treatment. Although this lack of ﬁtness can result in tumor
regression or decreased growth rate in the absence of selective
pressure, these observations should be used to guide alternative
dosing regimens upfront, rather than after the emergence of
resistant disease. Furthermore, intermittent dosing regimens
could be rationally combined with other therapeutic agents to
further exploit ﬁtness deﬁciencies that occur following withdrawal of agents targeting key oncogenic drivers.
