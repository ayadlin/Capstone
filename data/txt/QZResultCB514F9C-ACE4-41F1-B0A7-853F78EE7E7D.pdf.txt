ABSTRACT
p53 transduction is a potentially effective cancer therapy but does not result in
a good therapeutic response in all human cancers due to resistance to apoptosis. To
discover factors that overcome resistance to p53-induced apoptosis, we attempted
to identify RNAi sequences that enhance p53-induced apoptosis. We screened a
genome-wide lentiviral shRNA library in liver cancer Huh-7 and pancreatic cancer
Panc-1 cells, both of which resist p53-induced apoptosis. After the infection of
adenovirus expressing p53 or LacZ as a control, shRNA-treated populations were
analyzed by microarray. We identified shRNAs that were significantly decreased in
p53-infected cells compared with control cells. Among these shRNAs, shRNA-58335
was markedly decreased in both cancer cell lines tested. shRNA-58335 enhanced
p53-related apoptosis in vitro and augmented the inhibitory effect of adenoviral p53
transduction on tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the enhanced apoptotic response
by shRNA-58335 was also confirmed by treatment with PRIMA-1, which reactivates
mutant p53, instead of adenoviral p53 transduction. We found that shRNA-58335
evokes the apoptotic response following p53 transduction or functional restoration of
p53 with a small molecule drug in cancer cells resistant to p53-induced apoptosis. The
combination of p53 restoration and RNAi-based drugs is expected to be a promising
novel cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

apoptosis in cancers. In such cancers, p53 status does
not necessarily correlate with the responsiveness to
chemotherapy [5].
The activation of p53 is induced by a variety of
cell stresses, such as DNA damage, oncogene activation,
spindle damage and hypoxia. Activated p53 transactivates
not only coding genes but also non-coding RNAs,
including microRNAs (miRNAs) and large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), many of which are involved
in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [6, 7].
Although the precise mechanisms that regulate whether
a cell undergoes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis are unclear,
cell cycle arrest induced by p53 is mediated primarily

p53 is one of the most important tumor suppressor
genes. In approximately half of all human cancers, p53 is
inactivated as a direct result of mutations in the p53 gene
[1]. Furthermore, mutation or deletion of p53 is related
to poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation [2]. Therefore, vector-mediated gene transfer
of p53 has been viewed as a potentially effective cancer
therapy. However, gene transfer of p53 does not always
result in good therapeutic outcomes in all cancers [3, 4].
The inactivation of apoptotic machinery is considered as
one of the reasons that p53 transduction fails to induce

through the induction of the expression of p21 [8], which
is involved in restoring genomic integrity by functioning
in an anti-apoptotic manner [9]. Thus, the suppression
of p53-induced expression of p21 may lead to the
preferential induction of apoptosis rather than cell cycle
arrest following p53 activation. In our previous study, we
constructed a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus
that encoded co-cistronic p53 and artificial microRNAs
targeting endogenous p21, resulting in simultaneous
p53 expression and the suppression of p21 induction. In
colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, infection
with the adenovirus vector augmented apoptosis and
suppressed tumor growth compared with an adenovirus
that expressed p53 alone in vitro and in vivo [10]. Thus,
the combination of p53 and RNAi was shown to be a
potential novel cancer therapy.
To discover factors that modulate p53 pathways, we
attempted to identify RNAi sequences that enhance p53induced apoptosis. In this study, we screened a genomewide lentiviral shRNA library in cancer cells resistant
to p53-related apoptosis. We identified specific shRNAs
that were significantly decreased in p53-infected cells but
not in control cells. These results indicated that specific
shRNAs evoked the apoptotic response following p53
transduction or functional restoration of p53 in cancer
cells resistant to p53-induced apoptosis, suggesting that
the combination of p53 restoration and treatment with
specific shRNAs may be an effective cancer therapy.

determine the expression levels of each shRNA; as a
reference, the shRNA population in each cell line infected
with adenovirus expressing LacZ was also analyzed.

Identification of shRNA-decreased populations in
p53-transduced cells
We identified the shRNAs that were significantly
decreased in p53-infected cells compared with control
cells (Fig. 2A). Several shRNAs evoked the apoptotic
response following p53 transduction in cancer cells
resistant to p53-induced apoptosis. In Huh-7 cells, 547
shRNAs were decreased more than 4-fold in cells with
p53 transduction compared with control cells. In Panc-1
cells, 1418 shRNA were decreased more than 16-fold in
cells with p53 transduction compared with control cells
(Fig. 2A, areas encircled by dashed line). Furthermore,
28 shRNAs were commonly decreased in both cell lines
(Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table S1). Among these shRNAs,
shRNA-58335 in the presence of p53 was markedly
decreased (66-fold in Huh-7 cells and 436-fold in Panc-1
cells). Therefore, we further analyzed shRNA-58335.

Enhancement of p53-induced apoptosis by
shRNA-58335
Next, we stably infected lentivirus expressing
shRNA-58335 or a control sequence into Huh-7 cells
and quantified p53-induced apoptosis by evaluating
the sub-G1 population. In these cells, p53 transduction
induced a strong apoptotic response in shRNA-58335infected cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3A,
B). Additionally, treatment of adriamycin significantly

RESULTS
Genome-wide shRNA screening in p53-resistant
cancer cells
To identify shRNAs that can relieve resistance to
p53-induced apoptosis in cancer cells, we screened a
genome-wide lentiviral shRNA library in liver cancer Huh7 cells and pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells, as summarized
in Figure 1A and briefly described below. The Huh-7 and
Panc-1 cell lines have mutated p53 and a weak apoptotic
response following wild-type p53 transduction. The human
shRNA library, comprising approximately 200,000 shRNA
sequences targeting 47,400 human mRNA transcripts, was
packaged into lentivirus particles and pooled. First, we
infected the cell lines with the pooled lentiviral shRNA
library. Seventy-two hours after lentiviral infection,
the cells were infected with adenovirus expressing p53.
Forty-eight hours after adenoviral infection, total mRNA
was extracted, and mRNA, including shRNA sequences
derived from lentiviral vectors, was amplified by PCR.
In this shRNA library, each lentiviral vector shRNA
sequence corresponds to a probe sequence found on an
Affymetrix microarray (GeneChip). Therefore, the shRNA
populations can be quantified by cDNA microarray to

of the shRNA in LacZ-transduced control cells as log2. In Huh-7 cells, 547 shRNAs decreased more than 4-fold in p53-transduced cells
compared with control cells. In Panc-1 cells, 1418 shRNAs decreased more than 16-fold in p53-transduced cells compared with control

Enhancement of PRIMA-1-induced apoptosis by
shRNA-58335

enhanced the apoptotic response (Fig. 3A, B). Increased
caspase-3 cleavage, which serves as another indicator of
apoptosis, was also observed by western blotting (Fig.
3C). In colorectal cancer SW480 cells, which also have
mutated p53 and a weak apoptotic response following p53
transduction, shRNA-58335 sensitized the p53-induced
apoptotic response (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that
shRNA-58335 improved the apoptotic response after p53
transduction in other cancer cell lines.

p53 transduction by adenoviral vector is difficult to
deliver to cancer tissues in vivo. Previous report indicated
that histone deacetylase inhibitors reactivated mutant
p53 [12]. Recently, PRIMA-1 was identified as a lowmolecular-weight compound that restores the sequencespecific DNA binding and active conformation of mutant
p53 proteins [13] and demonstrated positive data in
phase 1/2 clinical trials of hematologic malignancies and
prostate cancer [14]. Therefore, we replaced adenoviral
p53 transduction with PRIMA-1 treatment to activate
p53, performed as in Fig. 3A. As observed in Fig. 3A,
the combinatorial treatment of PRIMA-1 and adriamycin
induced a strong apoptotic response in shRNA-58335infected cells compared with control-shRNA-infected cells

Inhibition of tumor growth by p53 transduction
with shRNA-58335 in vivo
To confirm whether the improved p53-induced
apoptotic response in vitro was correlated with a
therapeutic effect in vivo, we examined the tumor
suppressive effect of p53 transduction in a xenograft
model of tumorigenesis. shRNA-infected Huh-7 cells were
injected s.c. into nude mice. When tumor volume reached
a consistent size, adenovirus expressing p53 or LacZ was
injected directly into the tumor at days 0, 1 and 2 (Fig.
4, arrow). In control shRNA-infected Huh-7 cells, the
injection of Ad-p53 did not affect tumor volume (Fig. 4,
left). Conversely, in shRNA-58335-infected Huh-7 cells,
tumor volume was significantly decreased by injection
of Ad-p53 compared with Ad-LacZ (Fig. 4, right). These
results suggest that combined treatment with p53 and a
specific shRNA may be an effective cancer therapy in vivo.

(Fig. 5A, B). Furthermore, we evaluated the apoptotic
effect on Panc-1 cells by shRNA-58335 and PRIMA-1.
Adriamycin treatment alone did not induce an apoptotic
response in Panc-1 cells (data not shown). Therefore,
we treated Panc-1 cells with VP-16 (etoposide) and
quantified apoptosis by evaluating the sub-G1 population
(Fig. 5C). The combinatorial treatment of PRIMA-1 and
VP-16 significantly enhanced the apoptotic response in

shRNA-infected cells. These results demonstrated that
shRNA-58335 effectively enhanced the p53-induced
apoptotic response not only by p53 transduction but also
by the functional restoration of p53 with small molecule
treatment.

Altered gene expression pattern by shRNA-58335
in p53-transduced cells

confirmed, although the seed sequence of shRNA-58335
completely matched the AP2Î³ mRNA sequence
(Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, populations of
other shRNAs that target AP2Î³ mRNA (shRNA-58334,
58336 and 58337) were not significantly decreased in
p53-infected Huh-7 or Panc-1 cells compared with LacZinfected control cells. However, shRNA-58335 effectively
enhanced the p53-induced apoptotic response not only by
p53 transduction (Fig. 3, 4) but also by the functional
restoration of p53 with small molecule PRIMA-1 (Fig. 5).
These results may suggest that shRNA-58335 operates as
a molecular modulator in p53-related apoptosis through
other unknown mechanisms rather than through the
knockdown of the TFAP2C gene. Our microarray analysis
revealed that shRNA-58335 with p53 transduction
modulates gene expression associated with the process of
cell division (Table 1), whereas no genes were significantly
decreased more than twofold in shRNA-58335-infected
cells without p53 transduction compared with controlshRNA-infected cells. These results also support our
conclusion that shRNA-58335 does not knockdown any
specific genes. However, the molecular mechanism of
shRNA-58335-mediated enhancement of p53-related
apoptosis is unclear. Further functional analysis should be
performed in future studies.
We demonstrated that the apoptotic response
induced by adenoviral p53 transduction was enhanced
by shRNA-58335 in cancer cells resistant to p53-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 3, 4). However, the clinical application of
adenoviral vectors is presently limited because adenoviral
vectors must be administered locally [4]. Therefore, we
replaced adenoviral p53 transduction with PRIMA-1
treatment to reactivate mutant p53 [13] and successfully
confirmed the enhancement of an apoptotic response
by PRIMA-1 with shRNA-58335 treatment (Fig. 5).
PRIMA-1 can be intravenously administered in human
clinical studies [14]. Furthermore, non-viral delivery
systems, such as nanoparticles, for RNAi-based drug
treatments are also being developed and are in various
stages of clinical investigation [19, 20].
Most of clinically used chemotherapeutic agents
cause DNA damage and target dividing cells in S or M
phase. Therefore, chemotherapeutic agents not only kill
cancer cells but also injury normal dividing cells, resulting
in adverse effects of cancer treatment. In order to protect
normal cells from chemotherapeutic agents, pretreatment
of drugs which induce cell cycle arrest in normal cells, socalled âcyclotherapyâ is considered as an effective therapy
[21, 22]. Recent reports suggest that the pretreatment of
small-molecule p53 activators such as nutlin-3 protect
normal cells from chemotherapeutic agents [23, 24]. The
combination of p53 restoration, RNAi-based drugs and
p53-based cyclotherapy is expected to be a promising
novel cancer therapy in the near future.

According to the NCBI BLAST search (http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the seed sequence of shRNA-58335
is perfectly matched only to AP2Î³ (TFAP2C) among all
human transcripts in the RefSeq database. AP2Î³ belongs to
the AP-2 family of transcription factors and overexpressed
in human breast cancers and the overexpression related
with reduced patient survival [15]. A recent report
demonstrated that AP2Î³ is a key transcriptional regulator
for maintaining the luminal phenotype in human breast
carcinoma [16]. AP2Î³ is also a direct transcriptional target
of p53 [17]. We confirmed a statistically significant but
slight decrease in AP2Î³ mRNA levels by shRNA-58335
(Supplementary Figure S1). However, we were unable to
detect AP2Î³ protein using Western blotting. Therefore,
it remains controversial whether shRNA-58335 works
through the suppression of AP2Î³.
To explore the effect of shRNA-58335 on p53induced apoptosis, we evaluated gene expression by
cDNA microarray analysis in p53-transduced Huh-7
cells. We found that the expression of 350 genes was
decreased more than 2-fold in shRNA-58335-infected
Huh-7 cells compared with control-shRNA infected cells
(Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, gene ontology
analysis revealed that these genes were significantly
associated with cell cycle progression and cell division
(Table 1). These results indicate that shRNA-58335
evoked an apoptotic response following p53 transduction
by modulating the gene expression associated with the
process of cell division.

DISCUSSION
We demonstrated shRNAs that enhanced p53related apoptosis by screening a genome-wide shRNA
library. Conventional shRNA library screens have shown
shRNAs that resist p53-induced apoptosis through the
presence of p53-resistant cellular colonies [18]. However,
this method is not able to identify shRNAs that enhance
p53-related apoptosis because cells that include such
shRNAs are lost. Recently, array-based shRNA screening
was developed, allowing the direct quantification of the
amount of each shRNA. We applied this new method here
and successfully identified shRNAs that enhanced p53related apoptosis.
Although the shRNA library used in this study
included approximately 200,000 shRNA sequences
targeting 47,400 human mRNA transcripts, the knockdown
efficacy of each shRNA has not been validated. Therefore,
the screened shRNAs, the sequences of which match
specific transcripts, are not necessarily able to effectively
knockdown their target genes. In fact, only weak
suppression of the TFAP2C gene by shRNA-58335 was

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Antibodies and reagents
Adriamycin and VP-16 were purchased from Sigma.
PRIMA-1 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. The
anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-MDM2 (SMP14) and anti-p21
(F-5) mouse antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-actin mouse antibody was
purchased from Millipore, and the anti-caspase-3 (8G10)
rabbit antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology.

Cell culture
The hepatic cancer Huh-7 cell line, the pancreatic
cancer Panc-1 cell line and the colorectal cancer SW480
cell line were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection. Huh-7, Panc-1 and SW480 cells were cultured
in DMEM, RPMI-1640 and Leibovitz L-15 medium with
10% FCS, respectively. The construction, purification
and infection of replication-deficient recombinant
adenoviruses containing p53 (Ad-p53) or the bacterial
lacZ gene (Ad-LacZ) have been described previously [11].

Western blot analysis
Total cell lysate was extracted at 4Â°C with
RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris HCl, pH
8.0). The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore).
Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) (GE Healthcare).

shRNA library screening
shRNA library screening was performed according
to the manufacturerâs protocol. Briefly, 3Ã106 Huh-7 and
Panc-1 cells were plated on a 10-cm plate. Twenty-four
hours after plating, the cells were infected with lentivirus
particles from the GeneNet siRNA Library (System
Biosciences). Seventy-two hours after lentiviral infection,
Ad-p53 or Ad-LacZ was infected into these cells at an
MOI of 50. Forty-eight hours after adenoviral infection,
total RNA was extracted with TRIZol (Invitrogen). cDNA
was synthesized from extracted RNAs. siRNA inserts
were amplified from cDNA using two rounds of PCR with
biotinylated primers. PCR products were treated with
lambda exonuclease to remove the sense non-biotinylated
strand. Ten micrograms of biotinylated samples was
hybridized to an Affymetrix GenChip microarray (HGU133+ 2.0). The obtained data were analyzed with
GeneNet siRNA Library Data Analysis Software (System
Biosciences).

Flow cytometry
Cells (1Ã106) were plated on 6-well plates. After
infection or treatment, the cells were harvested by
trypsinization and pelleted by centrifugation. Pelleted
cells were fixed in 90% cold ethanol, treated with RNase A
(500 units/ml) and then stained with propidium iodide (50
mg/ml). The samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). The experiments were
repeated at least three times, and 50,000 events were
analyzed for each sample. Data were analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Animal models

Establishment of cell lines stably expressing
shRNAs

All animals were maintained under specific
pathogen free conditions and treated in accordance with
guidelines set by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of Sapporo Medical University. To evaluate the effects
of treating established tumors, 24 female BALB/c nude
mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 2Ã106 Huh7 cells infected with lentiviral shRNA-58335 or control
vector into both flanks. When the tumor size reached 100
mm3, the mice received a direct intratumoral injection of
1Ã109 p.f.u. (in 100 Âµl of PBS) of the indicated adenovirus
a total of three times on days 0, 1 and 2. Three mice were
used for each treatment group. Tumor formation in the
mice was monitored for up to 2 weeks. The tumor volume
was calculated using the equation V (mm3) = aÃb2/2,
where âaâ represents the largest dimension and âbâ is the
perpendicular diameter.

Huh-7 and Panc-1 cells were infected with
