ABSTRACT
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis that occurs in
children and is characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) serve as the sensor arm of the innate immune system and induce
proinflammatory cytokine expressions.
We recruited a total of 18 paired KD patients, before intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) and at least 3 weeks after IVIG treatment, 18 healthy controls, and 18 febrile
controls. For TLR genes and their cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) markers,
we used Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 and Illumina
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to evaluate gene expression levels and methylation
patterns, respectively.
KD patients demonstrated a significantly differential expression of TLR mRNA
levels compared to both the healthy and febrile controls, with only TLR 3 and 7
not differing between the KD patients and the controls. After patients underwent
IVIG treatment, the TLR mRNA levels, except for TLR3, decreased significantly in KD
patients. In contrast, the methylation status of the CpG sites of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9
demonstrated an opposite tendency between the two stages of both the KD samples
and the controls.
TLRs, particularly TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, may stimulate the immunopathogenesis
of KD. These results are among the first to use TLRs to prove that a bacterial
inflammatory response may trigger KD.

INTRODUCTION

for primary infection are called pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs). The family of toll-like receptors
(TLRs) is the best characterized class of PRRs in
mammalian species [3]. TLR signaling can result in
either the production of type 1 interferon co-stimulatory
molecules or the induction of a proinflammatory
cytokine cascade [4], which includes various known
cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8,
MCP-1, and antimicrobial peptides, all of which have
elevated values in the acute stage plasma of KD [5–7].
Currently, 10 TLRs have been identified in humans and

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a form of acute vasculitis
syndrome that impacts various systems. Although its
etiology is still unknown, the disease most commonly
occurs in children under the age of 5 years old [1]. The
most serious complications of KD are coronary artery
lesions (CAL), myocardial infarction, and coronary artery
aneurysm formation [2].

Differential expression of TLRs’ mRNA levels
among KD patients after undergoing IVIG
treatment and control subjects

12 in mice, including bacterial peptidoglycan (detected
by TLR1), lipoprotein and lipoteichoic acids (detected
by TLR2), double-stranded RNA (detected by TLR3),
LPS (detected by TLR4), flagellin (detected by TLR5),
single-stranded viral RNA (detected by TLR7 and 8),
and the unmethylated CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine)
DNA of bacteria and viruses (detected by TLR9) [8].
Although researchers have yet to unequivocally identify
consistent infectious pathogens in KD patients [9,
10], we previously found elevated TLR2 expression
on monocytes in both KD patients and mice with
lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-induced
coronary arteritis [5]. Furthermore, previous studies have
shown that TLR 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 may trigger the initial
immune response in KD patients [11–13].
The DNA methylation alteration of CpG sites
indicates the reversal change in gene expression [14]. In a
recent study, we reported a significant correlation between
the promoter methylation of gamma Fc region receptor II-a
among those susceptible to KD and the clinical outcomes
of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration.
Furthermore, IVIG administration considerably increases
methylation in KD [15]. Therefore, studying the differential
expressions and methylation alteration of TLRs between
KD patients and control subjects has merit. No studies have
yet surveyed TLRs 1–10 in the same report or performed
analysis with methylation profile. Therefore, in this study,
we examine mRNA expression of TLRs 1-10 and perform
analysis with methylation change in two different stages of
KD patients and controls.

As shown in Figure 3, we found no notable
differences in the mRNA levels of TLRs between KD
patients that received IVIG treatment and the healthy
controls. The mRNA levels of TLR2, 5, 7, and 9 were
significantly higher in the febrile controls than in the KD
patients after receiving IVIG treatment (Figure 3).

Significantly altered CpG sites on TLRs between
KD patients and controls
In this study, we used Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip (Illumina) to evaluate methylation patterns
of CpG sites on TLRs between KD patients and control
subjects and found significantly altered CpG sites on TLRs
(Table 1). We found that the methylation levels of TLR1,
2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 were significantly decreased in the acute
stage of KD patients compared to the healthy and febrile
controls (Figure 4). However, after IVIG administration,
the methylation status of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 was
significantly elevated in KD patients (Figure 5). Since
lower methylation leads to greater gene expression [15],
we focused on the correlation between DNA methylation
patterns and gene expressions. As shown in Figure 5, TLR1,
2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 demonstrate a hypo-methylated status in KD
patients prior to undergoing IVIG treatment compared with
the control subjects and the KD patients after undergoing
IVIG treatment. Therefore, the mRNA expression level
and DNA methylation of these TLRs demonstrate negative
correlations. To ensure un-biased results, we performed
10,000 re-samplings [16] for each TLR to extract pairs of
gene intensity and CpG marker β values in each group.
Therefore, we collected 40,000 pairs of gene intensity
and CpG marker β values from the four groups. Figure 6
demonstrates that gene expression level and CpG marker
methylation were significantly negatively correlated
(p < 0.001 for all TRLs), thus indicating that DNA
methylation represses gene expression.

RESULTS
Differential expression of TLR mRNA levels
among KD patients and controls
KD patients showed differential expression of
TLRs when compared to the healthy and febrile control
subjects. The mRNA levels of TLR1, 4, 5, 8, and 10 were
significantly elevated in KD patients compared to both
the healthy control and febrile control groups (Figure 1).
The mRNA levels of TLR2, 6, and 9 were significantly
elevated in the KD patient group versus the healthy
controls (Figure 1), while the mRNA levels of TLR 3 and
7 did not differ significantly among the groups.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first
to comprehensively report that TLRs were considerably
elevated in acute-stage KD patients and significantly
decreased following IVIG administration. Although the
etiology of KD remains unknown, we found that KD
stimulated the extraordinary up-regulation of most TLRs,
except for 3 and 7 mRNA expressions. More importantly,
the mRNA levels of TLR1, 4, 5, and 8 were significantly
elevated in KD patients compared to both the healthy and
febrile controls. We also observed that treating KD patients

Decreased expression of TLRs’ mRNA levels
among KD patients following IVIG administration
As shown in Figure 2, the mRNA levels of TLR1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 decreased significantly in KD
patients after undergoing IVIG treatment, while only the
mRNA levels of TLR 3 did not differ significantly in KD
patients following IVIG treatment.

with IVIG could significantly decrease these TLRs’
mRNA expression. In KD patients before undergoing
IVIG treatment, TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 demonstrate a
hypo-methylated status compared to the control subjects
and KD patients after IVIG treatment. In contrast, the
mRNA expression level and DNA methylation of these

TLRs demonstrate an opposite reverse tendency between
the two stages of KD samples and both controls.
Immune system activation is a trademark
characteristic of KD [6, 17, 18]. Children with certain
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of immune
genes (ex. CD40, BLK, ITPKC, and FCGR2A) [19, 20]

are susceptible to triggering over activated inflammatory
reactions through certain pathogens with a unique
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that
may be KD’s immunopathogenesis. Schulte et al. have
also demonstrated that both innate and adaptive immune
mechanisms are critical in a murine model of coronary
arteritis mimicking KD [21].

TLRs recognize a group of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns but also damage the associated
molecular patterns. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),
an endogenous damage associated with molecular patterns,
serves as danger signaling and provides a framework for
understanding the overlapping inflammatory responses
activated by pathogens and injury [22]. Furthermore,

elevated HMGB1 levels have been found in KD patients
[23] as a potential marker for poor response to IVIG
treatment [23]. Similarly, HMGB1 has been shown not
only to amplify inflammation but also to increase vascular
inflammation in various vasculitis diseases [24]. The
receptors involved in HMGB1 signal transduction are
TLR2 and TLR4 [25], which is consistent with our findings

that both TLR2 and TLR4 increased in KD patients and
then decreased after IVIG treatment. Moreover, TLR4
dependent macrophage signaling is associated with
coronary arterial disease [26]. Lipopolysaccharide, a TLR4
agonist, has been shown to drive hepcidin expression [27].
Hepcidin is triggered during infections and inflammation
[28]. In a previous study, we were the first to show that

to demonstrate correlations between mRNA levels and DNA methylation. The results demonstrated that mRNA levels were negatively
correlated with DNA methylation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient around −0.4 and p < 0.001).

hepcidin induces transient anemia and hypoferremia in the
acute inflammatory phase of KD [29]. Furthermore, TLR6
functionally produces heterodimer with TLR2 to facilitate
intracellular response to bacterial lipoprotein [30], while
TLR9 appears to respond to unmethylated CpG of bacterial
DNA [8]. Our results showed remarkable activation of
TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9, which correlates with bacteriarelated pathogen-associated molecular patterns, except
for activation of TLR3 and 7, which relates to doublestranded RNA and single-stranded viral RNA in the acute
stage of KD. These results support the evidence that KD
is a bacterium-like inflammatory disease. During the past
50 years, since Dr. Kawasaki’s first report in 1967, many
studies have attempted to identify a definitive infectious
agent that causes KD but have not succeeded. However,
certain superantigens from bacteria and intracellular
pathogens have been implicated in KD. Various bacteria,
including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis,
and Chlamydia pneumoniae, have been isolated in KD
patients [31, 32]. On the other hand, Chang et al. reported
that common respiratory viruses, such as coronaviruses,
adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses, were
associated with KD [33]. Stating for certain whether KD is
the result of a bacterial infection or a viral infection is still
not possible. Taken together, KD is not a purely infectious
disease with a cause-effect relationship with any pathogens
but can occur in hosts with certain genetic backgrounds.
Since IVIG is commonly understood to exert antiinflammatory properties in KD, we also reported that
IVIG treatment has a better impact on global methylation
alteration compared to KD’s onset [15]. In this study,
we demonstrated the DNA methylation on TLRs and
alterations between KD patients before and after IVIG
administration and the control subjects. We then showed
that hypomethylation at gene promoters of TLR1, 2, 4, 6,
8, and 9 increases the expression of downstream genes.
Vogelpoel et al. reported that the cross-talk between
FCGR2A and TLRs in human dendritic cells activated
anti-bacterial immunity through the selective induction
of TNFα and Th17-promoting cytokines response, which
agrees with our previous findings regarding Th-17, TNFα,
and FCGR2A in KD [17, 34]. The present study is the first
to demonstrate that epigenetics of DNA methylation on
TLRs may influence downstream gene expression in KD.

collected both before and after IVIG treatment [35, 36]
administered at the hospital. The fever control group
included patients that had been admitted to the hospital
with an acute infection, including acute pharyngitis,
acute tonsillitis, croup, acute bronchitis, pyuria, and
acute bronchiolitis. Peripheral blood samples of KD
patients were taken twice: once prior to receiving IVIG
treatment (pre-IVIG) and once at least three weeks after
completing IVIG treatment, with the latter functioning
as the convalescent stage samples (post-IVIG > 3 weeks)
[15]. The Chang Gung Memorial Hospital’s Institutional
Review Board (IRB No.:102-3779A3) approved this study,
and we obtained the written informed consent from the
parents or guardians of all the subjects. All of the methods
used comply with the relevant approved guidelines.

Experiment design
First, we collected whole blood samples from the
subjects, followed by white blood cell (WBC) enrichment.
The enriched WBC samples were subjected to either
RNA or DNA extraction. Pursuant to the manufacturer’s
instructions, we used an isolation kit (mirVana™
miRNA Isolation Kit, Catalog number: AM1560, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to isolate total RNA. Then
we measured the collected RNA samples with Bioanalyzer
(ABI) and Qubit (Thermo) to determine RNA quality (RIN
value) and quantity. All RNA samples passed the criterion
of RIN ≥ 7. The DNA samples were isolated and treated
with bisulfite as described in a previous study [37].

Gene expression profiling with microarray
For strong, unbiased results, pooled RNA libraries
were produced by evenly pooling six RNA samples,
which resulted in three pooled normal control, three fever
control, three pre-IVIG, and three post-IVIG libraries.
The pooled RNA samples underwent microarray assay to
determine gene expression profile. In this study, we carried
out profiling with GeneChip® Human Transcriptome
Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0, Affymetrix, Santa Clara). The RNA
samples were prepared using the WT PLUS Reagent kit,
followed by hybridization on HTA 2.0 microarray chips.
In accordance with Affymetrix manuals, the raw data of
the HTA 2.0 chips underwent quality control examination.
The chips that passed the quality control criteria were
analyzed with Partek (Partek, St. Louis), a commercial
software specifically for microarray data analysis. Using
Partek, we conducted ANOVA analysis and reported the
p-values of the comparisons of interest.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study consists of a total of 54 subjects from
Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Children’s Hospital in
Taiwan from 2012 to 2014. Of those, 18 subjects were
healthy controls (with neither fever nor KD history), 18
subjects were fever controls (with fever but not diagnosed
to have KD), and the remaining 18 subjects were KD
patients that met the KD diagnosis criteria and had samples

DNA methylation profiling with Illumina M450K
BeadChip
We used Illumina HumanMethylation450 (M450K)
BeadChip to perform genome-wide screening of DNA
methylation patterns. M450K BeadChip was designed

Oncotarget

to detect methylation patterns of approximately 450,000
CpG markers that span the human genome. More
information about M450 BeadChip can be found at
http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/infinium_
humanmethylation450_beadchip_kit.html. For each
M450K BeadChip assay, 200 ng of bisulfite-converted
genomic DNA was applied in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Afterward, for each CpG
marker in each sample, we determined the methylation
percentage of cytosine, referred to as β values.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard error. We
applied Student’s t-test or, when appropriate, one-way
ANOVA to analyze quantitative data. We evaluated any
data changes before and after IVIG treatment using the
paired sample t-test. We performed all statistical analyses
using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows XP (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, USA), and a two-sided p-value less than 0.05 is
considered statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS
KD patients showed remarkably increased TLRs’
mRNA expression and hypomethylation at the gene
promoters of TLRs. Meanwhile, treating KD patients
with IVIG can significantly decrease these TLRs’ mRNA
expression and restore the methylation of TLRs. TLRs,
especially TLR 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, may participate in KD’s
immunopathogenesis.
