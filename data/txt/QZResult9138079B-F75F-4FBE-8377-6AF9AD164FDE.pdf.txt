The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are
clonal disorders of hematopoiesis that arise as a result of
aberrant activation of tyrosine kinases and result in the
proliferation and accumulation of mature myeloid cells
in the blood, bone marrow and spleen. The prototypical
MPN, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by
constitutive activation of ABL kinase occurring as a
result of the BCR-ABL fusion. Importantly, targeted
therapy to inhibit ABL kinase signaling, using imatinib,
induces durable clinical responses in the majority of
CML patients. The molecular pathogenesis of the BCRABL negative MPNs, polycythemia vera (too many red
cells), essential thrombocythemia (too many platelets) and
myelofibrosis, was elucidated in 2005 with the discovery
of JAK2V617F, an activating mutation in the non-receptor
tyrosine kinase, JAK2 [1]. The JAK2V617F mutation is
present in more than 95% patients with polycythemia
vera, and approximately 50% patients with essential
thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis. In advanced disease,
MPN may transform to acute leukaemia and this is
associated with a dismal prognosis.
In MPN, JAK2V617F is found in long-term
hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), a population of rare
quiescent cells present in the bone marrow and capable
of long-term self-renewal. These somatically mutated LT-

MPN stem cells

HSCs, referred to as MPN-propagating cells or MPN stem
cells, maintain the MPN throughout the life of the patient
and can serially transplant disease in animal models of
Jak2V617F-mediated MPN [2, 3]. To definitively cure
MPN will require complete eradication of the MPN
disease-maintaining stem cell population. In contrast to
the efficacy of imatinib in achieving molecular remissions
in CML, JAK2 kinase inhibitors have shown only modest
benefit in the treatment of myelofibrosis, namely in
reducing splenomegaly and improving constitutional
symptoms. Furthermore, the lack of an effect of the
JAK2 inhibitors on reducing JAK2V617F allele burden
in myelofibrosis patients [4] and the demonstration that
MPN-propagating cells are insensitive to JAK2 kinase
inhibition in vivo [2] suggests that MPN stem cells do
not require JAK2 signaling for survival and that JAK2
inhibitor monotherapy will not cure MPN patients.
The clinical efficacy of long-acting pegylated
IFNα in MPN has renewed interest in understanding the
mechanism of action of IFNα treatment in JAK2V617Fmediated MPN. Prolonged IFNα treatment results in
normalization of blood counts in most patients with
polycythemia vera, reduces JAK2V617F allele burden
and in 15-40% of patients, the JAK2V617F mutant clone
is rendered undetectable to sensitive molecular assays[5,

Figure1: MPN stem cells are responsible for disease initiation and propagation in vivo. IFNα therapy has direct effects on

MPN stem cells leading to depletion of LT-HSCs, exit from quiescence and enforced terminal differentiation. Additionally, IFNα may have
direct effects on downstream effector cells leading to reduction in blood counts and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The effects of IFNα on
preventing fibrotic and/or leukemic transformation have not yet been defined

6]. These clinical results suggest that IFNα eradicates
JAK2V617F-mutant LT-HSC, however the mechanism by
which molecular remissions are achieved in MPN patients
in response to treatment with IFNα have not been well
defined.
To determine the efficacy of IFNα therapy on
Jak2V617F-positive MPN stem cells in vivo, we used
a murine model of Jak2V617F-mediated MPN [7]. We
found that prolonged treatment of Jak2V617F mice
with IFNα reversed the myeloproliferation phenotype
(normalizing hemoglobin and white cell count and
reducing extramedullary hematopoiesis). Importantly, we
observed selective depletion of Jak2V617F over WT LTHSC and this correlated with an inability of IFNα treated
mice to propagate MPN into transplanted recipients. IFNα
can directly activate the cell cycle in quiescent wild-type
(WT) LT-HSCs and induce HSC proliferation in vivo [8].
We found that IFNα treatment induced enhanced cell-cycle
activation of Jak2V617F-mutant LT-HSCs, as compared to
WT LT-HSCs, explaining this preferential depletion over
time. Using Ifnar1 knock-out mice (lacking the type 1
interferon receptor), we showed that the effects of IFNα
on cell cycle are specifically mediated through type 1
interferon signaling and are intrinsic to Jak2V617F-mutant
LT-HSCs. Using gene expression analysis we found an
enrichment of cell cycle genes in Jak2V617F-mutant LTHSC, both at baseline and after IFNα treatment, providing
a potential explanation for their preferential sensitivity to
IFNα treatment.
This work suggests that IFNα achieves molecular
remissions in JAK2V617F-positive MPN patients through
the activation and consequent depletion of quiescent
MPN disease-propagating cells. What are the clinical
implications of this work? Firstly, these data support
the rational design of clinical trials to test combinatorial
therapeutic approaches using IFNα (to target quiescent
MPN-stem cells) together with JAK2 kinase inhibitors
or cytotoxic chemotherapy (to target actively cycling
progenitor populations). Plausibly, the depletion of MPN
stem cells in polycythemia vera could alter the natural
history of the disease, through eliminating the malignant
clone and thus preventing fibrotic and/or leukemic
transformation, both devastating complications of MPN.
Currently, IFNα is far from an ideal drug, and few patients
are able to tolerate prolonged treatment due to its side
effects. We have identified a number of novel targets
that are differentially regulated in Jak2V617F and WT
LT-HSCs following IFNα treatment. In ongoing studies,
we are working to validate these targets with the goal
of developing more specific, less toxic IFNα derivatives
capable of selectively eliminating MPN stem cells, while
sparing normal LT-HSCs and other organ systems.
