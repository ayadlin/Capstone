Abstract
Estrogens and selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators
such as tamoxifen are known to increase uterine cell
proliferation. Mounting evidence suggests that estrogen
signaling is mediated not only by ERA and ERB nuclear
receptors, but also by GPR30 (GPER), a seven transmembrane
(7TM) receptor. Here, we report that primary human
endometriotic H-38 cells express high levels of GPR30 with
no detectable ERA or ERB. Using a novel tamoxifen analogue,
STX, which activates GPR30 but not ERs, significant stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways was observed in
H-38 cells and in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells expressing
GPR30; a similar effect was observed in JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells. STX treatment also increased cellular pools of
phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate, a proposed ligand
for the nuclear hormone receptor SF-1 (NR5A1). Consistent
with these findings, STX, tamoxifen, and the phytoestrogen
genistein were able to increase SF-1 transcription, promote
Ishikawa cell proliferation, and induce the SF-1 target gene
aromatase in a GPR30-dependent manner. Our findings
suggest a novel signaling paradigm that is initiated by
estrogen activation of the 7TM receptor GPR30, with signal
transduction cascades (PI3K and MAPK) converging on
nuclear hormone receptors (SF-1/LRH-1) to modulate their
transcriptional output. We propose that this novel GPR30/
SF-1 pathway increases local concentrations of estrogen,
and together with classic ER signaling, mediate the proliferative effects of synthetic estrogens such as tamoxifen, in
promoting endometriosis and endometrial cancers. [Cancer
Res 2009;69(13):5415–23]

Introduction
Biological effects of 17h-estradiol (17hE2) and other synthetic
estrogens result from the activation and subsequent interaction of
nuclear estrogen receptors (ER)a and ERh with the genome. This
classic or genomic mode of ER action is slow compared with rapid
or nongenomic estrogen responses that can occur within minutes

(1, 2). Several studies suggest that nongenomic responses to
estrogen are mediated by two distinct mechanisms involving
membrane ERs. The first invokes localization of nuclear ER at the
plasma membrane (3–5), whereas the second incorporates the
seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptor GPR30 (GPER; refs. 6, 7).
Similar to ER, GPR30 is not only activated by a wide variety of
estrogenic compounds including ER agonists, but also by partial
antagonists such as tamoxifen (7–10). Although the potential
contribution of GPR30 in breast cancer remains unclear (11),
activation of GPR30 promotes proliferation of both uterine (12)
and thyroid (9) cancer cells. Indeed, breast cancer cell lines
including ER-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (SKBR3) lines
strongly express GPR30 (7, 13). Moreover, a National Cancer
Institute–sponsored survey of breast carcinomas reported that
correlation between receptor expression and clinical outcomes
are distinct for GPR30 and ER, with GPR30 expression strongly
associated with HER2 expression and tumor progression (14).
Despite the lingering controversies surrounding the contribution
of GPR30 to breast cancer, recent analyses of GPR30 knockout
mouse firmly establish this 7TM receptor as an important player
in mediating estrogen responses in vivo. Indeed, estrogen-induced
thymic atrophy is severely compromised in GPR30 null mice (15).
Other phenotypes, especially those involving reproduction, have yet
to be reported in mice lacking GPR30. Regardless, the sum of these
in vivo and in vitro data suggests strongly that physiologic
responses initiated by natural and synthetic estrogens extend
beyond the nucleus to include the 7TM receptor, GPR30.
Estrogenic ligand signaling through GPR30 is shown to have a
number of rapid effects, including activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways (7, 10, 16). Activation of these proliferative
pathways by GPR30 is proposed to be propagated by transactivation of the plasma membrane tyrosine kinase receptor
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (13). However, the fact that
the GPR30-specific agonist G-1 (17) and EGF (18) stimulate
proliferation in ER-negative SKBR3 breast cancer cells whereas
E2 does not (18) suggests that GPR30 signaling may involve other
mechanisms. Nonetheless, stimulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling
pathways by GPR30 coincides with mechanisms proposed to
activate NR5A nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1
(SF-1) and liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1). Both of these
transcription factors are important during development and in the
adult due to their regulation of steroidogenesis and bile acid
synthesis (19). Similar to other nuclear receptors, activation of
the MAPK pathway and receptor phosphorylation by extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) increases NR5A receptor activity
(20). However, structural analyses of SF-1 and LRH-1 also revealed

phosphatidylinositols including phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5trisphosphate (PIP3) as a potentially unique class of ligands for
this subfamily of nuclear receptors (21, 22).
Based on these collective findings, we hypothesized that GPR30
stimulation of PI3K- and MAPK pathways would increase the
activity of SF-1/LRH-1. Unfortunately, distinguishing GPR30- from
ER-specific effects is difficult in many cells. Therefore, synthetic
compounds selective for GPR30, but not ERs, are useful tools for
dissecting these signaling pathways. Two agonists proposed to
activate membrane ERs include the GPR30-selective agonist G-1
(23), and the biphenylacrylamide compound STX that resembles
4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT; ref. 24); no binding to nuclear ERs is
exhibited by either compound. Although direct binding of STX
to GPR30 has yet to be shown, primary hypothalamic neurons
isolated from ERa and ERh double knockout mice elicit a rapid
and specific response to STX that mimics the response to a bovine
serum albumin (BSA)–estradiol conjugate, suggesting that the
biological response to STX is mediated through an estrogen
membrane receptor such as GPR30 (25, 26).
To test the hypothesis that GPR30 mediates NR5A activation via
estrogens, primary human endometriotic and immortalized uterine
cancer cell lines were assayed with STX. Our results suggest a novel
cellular signaling paradigm that is initiated by estrogen activation
of the 7TM receptor GPR30, with signal transduction cascades
(PI3K and MAPK) converging on nuclear hormone receptors (SF-1/
LRH-1) to modulate their transcriptional output. Based on our
findings, we speculate that such a pathway might contribute to the
known proliferative effects of tamoxifen and other natural estrogens in the female reproductive tract.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and reagents. Full-length human GPR30 (hGPR30) was
isolated and expressed from a pIRESneo expression vector (Clontech
Laboratories) harboring an NH2-terminal 3X-FLAG- or HA-epitope tag
(FLAG-hGPR30/pIRESneo). Double-stranded RNAi oligonucleotides for
GPR30, LRH-1, and GFP were cloned into the pSUPERneo vector
(DNAengine). Full-length mouse SF-1 (mSF-1) was expressed from as either
HA or 3X FLAG tagged version in pCIneo or pcDNA3, respectively. 3X
FLAG-mSF-1 S203A and A270W mutants were created using the
QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length human
LRH-1 was obtained from human ductal carcinoma T47-D cDNA and
subcloned into a 3X-FLAG epitope-tagged pcDNA3 vector. ERs, and ERE
TATA-Luc vectors, were generous gifts from S. Kato (University of Tokyo,
Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies, chemicals, and oligonucleotides used are
specified in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.
Cell culture and luciferase assays. Ishikawa and JEG3 cells were
maintained in DME/H-21, 4.5 g/L glucose supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and 1X penicillin/streptomycin. Endometriotic stromal
H-38 cells were maintained in DME high glucose 50%/F-12 50% mixed with
10% FBS and 1X penicillin/streptomycin. Ishikawa cells stably expressing
HA-hGPR30 were grown in selective medium containing 300 Ag/mL of
geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in phenol red–free medium with
5% charcoal-dextran–stripped (CDS) FBS and cotransfected in serum-free
medium with indicated receptor or siRNA construct using FuGENE
6 (Roche). Drugs were added to cells 4 to 8 h before harvesting to
achieve maximal stimulation. All luciferase assays were normalized to
h-galactosidase activity and results expressed as relative luciferase units or
fold activation with all data representing the mean F SD from three
independent experiments performed in triplicate.
Proliferation studies. For quantitative fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis, Ishikawa cells were cultured in phenol red–free

medium containing 5% CDS FBS for 48 h. Cells were treated with drugs as
indicated for 16 h, collected, permeabilized with 40% ethanol in PBS, and
resuspended in staining solution (50 AM propidium iodide, 3.8 mM sodium
citrate in PBS RNase solution). Cell-cycle data were collected with a Becton
Dickinson FACScan Immunocytochemistry system and analyzed with
ModFit LT (Verity Software House).
For cell proliferation assays, Ishikawa cells were seeded in six-well
plates with phenol red–free medium containing 5% CDS FBS. Cells were
washed and the medium changed to 1% CDS and drug, as indicated.
Medium and drugs were renewed every 2 d. Cell number was counted in
a hemocytometer.
Immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analyses. For phospho-Akt
and phospho-ERK1/2 analyses, Ishikawa cells were transfected with
hGPR30. For phospho-SF-1 analysis, JEG3 cells were transfected with 3XFLAG-mSF-1. Following transfection, cells were serum starved in phenol
red–free medium, except for endometriosis H-38 cells where 2% CDS FBS
was added. Cells were treated with drugs as indicated, washed, and lysed
in ice cold 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM EGTA, 1% NaDeoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1X Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail I, and II (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts
of total protein were probed with antibodies directed against phospho-Akt
(Ser473; 1:1,000), Akt (1:1,000), phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1,000), ERK1/2 (1:1,000),
pSF-1 (1:2,500), or M2-Flag (1:5,000). Signal was detected using SuperSignal
West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). For all Western blots,
equivalent levels of protein were added to each lane, as determined by a
Bradford protein assay.
H-38 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before being permeabilized
with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4jC in PBS containing 5% BSA. Primary antibodies
were as follows: anti-GPR30 (Lifespan Biosciences; 1:250) and anti-calnexin
(Abcam; 1:250). Images were collected using a Zeiss Pascal confocal
microscope.
(32P) orthophosphate in vivo labeling and high performance
liquid chromatography analysis of PIP3. Ishikawa cells containing
empty vector or stably overexpressing GPR30 were starved in serum- and
phosphate-free medium for 2 h, were labeled with 500 ACi of (32P)orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37jC in 5% CO2 and
then treated with DMSO or drug for 15 min. Total lipids were extracted into
chloroform, deacylated in 750 AL of methylamine/methanol/n-butanol/H2O
(26:45:11:16) at 53jC for 50 min, and polar head groups extracted into
10 mM NH4H2PO4. Anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography was used to separate soluble glycero-inositol head groups over a
gradient of NH4H2PO4, and monitored using a Packard flow scintillation
detector and compared with 32P-labeled standards (Amersham Biosciences,
Sigma). All peaks were integrated using Pro-Star Varian Software, and PI(4)P
levels or total radioactivity served as internal controls to quantify, both
giving similar results.

Results
Human ectopic endometrial cells express GPR30 and SF-1,
but not ERs. We initially examined GPR30 expression in primary
human stromal endometriotic H-38 cells obtained from patients
with endometriosis, because GPR30 is amplified in endometrial
cancer, is associated with advanced tumors and a poorer predicted
survival rate (27), and seems to be enriched in the endometrium
during the proliferative phase (28). We also used normal primary
human endometrial cells (Endo), and several human cancer cell
lines including MCF-7 breast, Ishikawa endometrial, and JEG3
placental cells for these studies. H-38 cells clearly express GPR30
as measured by quantitative PCR, with only MCF-7 cancer cells
expressing higher levels (Fig. 1A). By contrast, neither ERa nor
ERh transcripts were detected in H-38 primary endometriotic cells
(Fig. 1A), suggesting that any estrogenic ligand effects would likely

be mediated by GPR30. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that
GPR30 is expressed in the H-38 cells and colocalized with calnexin,
a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1B), consistent with
GPR30 localization on intracellular membranes (7).
Estrogen synthesis is markedly elevated in H-38 endometriotic
cells compared with normal endometrial cells due to elevation in
transcript levels encoding cytochrome p450 enzyme aromatase
(Cyp19a1; ref. 29). Higher estrogen output by these cells is proposed
to maintain endometrial cells in an ectopic location and contribute
to endometrial cancer (30). Consistent with increased estrogen
production in H-38 cells and the fact that Cyp19a1 is a known target
of SF-1 (31), both Cyp19a1 and SF-1 transcripts are significantly
elevated compared with primary endometrial cells (Fig. 1C).
To examine how H-38 endometriotic cells respond to estrogens
in the absence of ERs, we used a variety of estrogens including STX
and OHT. Although OHT is proposed to act as a partial estrogen
agonist in the uterus (32, 33), STX is a novel diphenylacrylamide
tamoxifen analogue (Fig. 2A) that has previously been linked to
estrogen activation of a GPCR (25, 26). Indeed, gene profiling in
Ishikawa cells suggests that STX activates a distinct subset of
genes from the cluster of genes induced by both OHT and 17hE2
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Both OHT and STX induce rapid phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, (Fig. 2B), showing that estrogen
signaling is present in the apparent absence of any detectable
ERa or ERh (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, OHT and STX activated the
MAPK and PI3K pathways significantly more than 17h estradiol
(17hE2; Fig. 2B), possibly reflecting more robust activation of
GPR30 in this cellular context, as noted by others (12, 17). Taken
together, these data show that human endometriotic cells express
high levels of GPR30 and activate proliferative signals in response
to OHT and STX.

STX fails to bind, antagonize, or activate ERA and ERB. To
determine the GPR30-dependent effects of STX, we used other
relevant cell lines that could be more easily manipulated, and did
not exhibit the low transfection efficiency and extremely high
levels of SF-1 and Cyp19a as observed for H-38 cells. Given that
the affinity of STX for ERa and ERh is several logs lower (106)
compared with 17hE2 (Fig. 3A; ref. 24), it is not surprising that
STX was unable to activate or repress a classic estrogen response
element luciferase reporter (ERE TATA-Luc). No activation was
observed in human placental choriocarcinoma cells JEG3 cells
transiently overexpressing ERa; these cells are ERa/h negative and
GPR30 positive. A similar observation was observed in human
endometrial cancer Ishikawa cells, which express endogenous ERh
(Fig. 3B). Consistent with data obtained in primary endometriotic
H-38 cells, these results establish that STX signaling is independent
of ERs and unlike OHT, STX neither activates nor antagonizes
classic ERE-reporter constructs. Thus, although STX and OHT
share similar structural features, STX fails to activate ERa/ERh.
SF-1 transcriptional activation via estrogen stimulation
of GPR30. We next assessed the potential link between GPR30
stimulation and activation of SF-1 or LRH-1. Ligand-stimulated
GPR30 triggers activation of the MAPK pathway, which is then
predicted to activate SF-1 by direct phosphorylation. GPR30 also
stimulates the PI3K pathway, elevating cellular PIP3 levels (Fig. 2B;

ref. 2), which is also predicted to activate NR5A receptors by direct
binding of PIP3 to the ligand binding domain (21). Using JEG3 cells
that express endogenous GPR30, but very low levels of SF-1 and no
ER, we found that both 17hE2 and STX produced dose- and timedependent activation of an aromatase promoter luciferase reporter
(Aro-Luc), after addition of mSF-1 and human LRH-1 (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3; Fig. 4A). STX failed to enhance the activity of
estrogen-related receptor (ERRa; data not shown). Similar to other
studies (9), we found that the estrogen antagonist, ICI182,780, failed
to mimic STX (data not shown), despite the fact that ICI is reported
to bind GPR30 directly (34). SF-1 mutants defective for phosphorylation (S203A) or with a disrupted ligand binding pocket (A270W)
decreased or eliminated estrogen and STX stimulation of SF-1
transcriptional activity compared with wild-type SF-1, establishing
the requirement for both Ser203 phosphorylation and a fully
accessible ligand binding pocket for these estrogenic compounds
to activate SF-1 (see Fig. 4B; ref. 21).
Inhibiting MAPK and PI3K signaling attenuates STX
activation of SF-1 in JEG3 cells. Consistent with known effects
of MAPK signaling on SF-1 and LRH-1, pharmacologic inhibitors
of either MAPK/ERK kinase or PI3K (U0126 or wortmannin,
respectively) effectively blocked 17hE2 and STX activation of SF-1
(Fig. 4C, left). Furthermore, STX treatment increased ERK activation (phospho-ERK1/2) and SF-1 phosphorylation to equivalent

levels as observed with EGF (Fig. 4C, right). Importantly, siRNA
directed against GPR30 abolished the ability of 17hE2 or STX to
induce SF-1–dependent transcription (Fig. 4D, left), as well as the
ability of STX to induce SF-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D, right).
Interestingly, knocking down GPR30 consistently lowered basal
levels of SF-1 phosphorylation, as shown in the DMSO control ( ).
Collectively, these data establish that SF-1 activation via estrogen
and STX signaling is GPR30-dependent in JEG3 cells. Furthermore,
receptor activation by STX and 17hE2 required phosphorylation of
SF-1 and an accessible ligand-binding pocket.

STX activates SF-1 and increases PIP3 accumulation in
Ishikawa cells. We next asked if STX stimulation of GPR30 is linked
to NR5A receptor activation in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells,
where both GPR30 and nuclear ER signaling are suggested to promote proliferation (10, 12). In these cells, STX stimulation of SF-1
was amplified after increasing GPR30 expression transiently (Supplementary Fig. S3). Given this fact, we created a stable Ishikawa cell
line expressing GPR30 comparable with levels observed in MCF-7
cells to fully characterize the pharmacologic effects of STX (Figs. 5A,
right, and 1A). These cells exhibited SF-1–dependent activation of

the Aro-Luc reporter after 17hE2, OHT, and STX treatment, but not
with the inactive 17aE2 (Fig. 5A, left). Consistent with effects in
endometriotic H-38 cells, we observed robust activation of the
MAPK and PI3K pathways after treatment with OHT and STX in
Ishikawa cells expressing GPR30 (Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 5B).
Ishikawa cells are ERh positive and express lower levels of GPR30
and ERa than MCF-7 cells (refer back to Fig. 1A).
Previous descriptive studies using a fluorescent-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of Akt suggested that stimulation of GPR30
results in nuclear PIP3 accumulation (7, 23). To determine if STX
similarly increased cellular pools of PIP3, we measured levels of
this very scarce phospholipid after STX stimulation of Ishikawa
cells stably expressing GPR30 (see Materials and Methods). A dosedependent STX-induced increase in PIP3 accumulation was
observed with a maximal response occurring at 1 AM drug
(Fig. 5C and D); this same dose corresponded to the maximal
stimulation of SF-1–dependent activation of the Aro-Luc reporter
(refer to Figs. 4A and 5D). No accumulation of PIP3 was detected in
cells treated with the inactive 17aE2 epimer, or with DMSO vehicle
(data not shown). Taken together, these data show that estrogen
signaling via GPR30 increases cellular levels of PIP3. Our ability to

detect STX-induced increases in cellular PIP3, the least abundant
cellular phosphatidylinositol, most likely reflects the fact that
Ishikawa cells are negative for the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which
removes the 3¶ phosphate. Although others report that estrogen
acting via ERa increases endogenous PIP3 in endothelial cells (35),
our data using the selective compound STX suggest strongly that
this effect on PI3K signaling might also be mediated by GPR30.
Effects of STX on cellular proliferation and aromatase
(Cyp19a1) expression. Increased Ishikawa cell proliferation after
17hE2 or OHT treatment is attributed to the combined actions of
both nuclear ERs and GPR30 (12). This prompted us to measure
endogenous Cyp19a1 (aromatase) expression after STX treatment,
given that both SF-1/LRH-1 are known to control expression of
promoter II of Cyp19a1 (36). Indeed, we found that STX, OHT, and
genistein, but not 17aE2, elevate endogenous Cyp19a1 transcripts
in Ishikawa cells with induction greatly enhanced by GPR30
expression (Fig. 6A). Knockdown experiments using siRNA show
that STX activation of Cyp19a1 depends on both GPR30 and LRH-1
(Supplementary Fig. S5; Fig. 6B). Finally, we observed a marked
increase in Ishikawa cell proliferation as measured in two
independent assays after treatment with STX, OHT, or the dietary

proposed model of GPR30 and NR5A receptor signaling by

GPR30 is reported to reside on either the plasma
membrane (49) and/or on intracellular membranes (7), as
depicted in the model. GPR30 activation by STX or OHT
increases ERK1/2 and PI3K phosphorylation and elevates
the cellular pools of PIP3. Collectively, these events
activate NR5A nuclear receptor activity to promote
increased expression of target genes such as aromatase.

estrogen genistein, but not with 17aE2 (Supplementary Fig. S6;
Fig. 6C). Overexpressing GPR30 amplified this response (Fig. 6C,
right), although stimulation by 17hE2 was less robust than observed
with STX. That STX elevates endogenous levels of the NR5A target
aromatase and increases cell proliferation in a GPR30-dependent
manner suggests that estrogen signaling via GPR30 might be an
important pathway for increasing local levels of estrogen, and for
promoting cellular proliferation in endometrial cells.

Discussion
Here, we provide data supporting a novel pathway linking
estrogen stimulation of the membrane receptor GPR30 with
activation of NR5A nuclear receptors and the target gene

aromatase (Fig. 6D). Using human Ishikawa endometrial cancer
cells or human primary endometriotic H-38 cells, we report that
the GPR30-dependent tamoxifen-analogue STX rapidly activates
both the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, and increases levels
of cellular PIP3 in a dose-dependent manner. In Ishikawa cells, STX
as well as OHT elevated endogenous levels of aromatase (Cyp19a1)
and increased proliferation in a GPR30-dependent manner. These
data suggest that STX activation of NR5A receptors depends on
GPR30, but not nuclear ER signaling. Our study is now one of
several suggesting that the physiologic effect of estrogen signaling
in normal and disease states can be expanded beyond nuclear ER
signaling to include a 7TM receptor. Using human primary H-38
cells, we provide further evidence that GPR30 alone is sufficient
for estrogen signaling (Figs. 1A and 6D). Moreover, this novel

GPR30/SF-1 pathway shows how synthetic estrogen analogues such
as OHT and STX increase local concentrations of estrogen, thereby
amplifying estrogen signaling.
The link between estrogens and NR5A receptor activity is
especially intriguing given that both SF-1 and LRH-1 are involved in
steroid and estrogen production (37). When placed in the context
of prior studies, our findings imply that GPR30 activation and
up-regulation of SF-1 set up a feed-forward autocrine pathway
for continuous synthesis of estradiol in tissues such as ectopic
endometrium. Indeed, profiling studies comparing human ectopic
and eutopic endometrium confirm that SF-1 and estradiol
biosynthesis are amplified in ectopic disease tissue (38, 39).
Mendelson and colleagues (40) found that immortalized human
endometrial cells readily convert exogenously applied androstenedione to estradiol, with this androgen also promoting SF-1
recruitment to the CYP19A1 promoter. Regardless of whether
androstenedione is supplied exogenously from the peritoneal cavity
(41) or is synthesized de novo by ectopic endometrium,
amplification of SF-1 ensures that local estrogen signaling
increases dramatically in endometriosis.
Our model depicted in Fig. 6D also predicts that many dietary
and environmental xenoestrogens could bind to GPR30, stimulate
the PI3K/MAPK pathways, and ultimately activate SF-1. Indeed, in
cellular assays, we find that the dietary estrogen genistein mimics
STX, consistent with studies showing genistein to be the best
competitive inhibitor of E2 binding to GPR30 (34). Given the
crucial role of NR5A receptors in regulating early gonadal
development, steroidogenesis, and peptide hormone signaling,
genistein activation of GPR30 might be predicted to disturb
genetic programs targeted by SF-1, and as a result alter
reproductive and endocrine tissue development. Interestingly,
although GPR30 is expressed in many endocrine tissues including
the uterus, loss of GPR30 in mice does not impair reproduction,
suggesting that GPR30 is not an essential gene for urogenital
development (15).
STX is similar to other synthetic and environmental estrogens
that activate the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways in a GPR30dependent manner (42, 43). The activation of PI3K by STX is of
particular interest given that phospholipids seem to be integrally
associated with purified human SF-1 (44) and that phosphatidylinositols such as PIP3 are hypothesized to modulate SF-1 activity
(19, 22). Indeed, we show that STX increased cellular PIP3 and that
STX stimulation of Cyp19a depends on an intact ligand-binding

pocket mutant. Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that
STX activation of GPR30 increases PIP3 cellular pools to then
activate SF-1 with additional receptor activation arising from
MAPK signaling and increased SF-1 phosphorylation. That STX
elevated cellular PIP3 pools and activated the PI3K pathway might
also be relevant to the increased risk of endometrioid ovarian
cancer associated with endometriosis (45). Given that PTEN
mutations are common in both uterine and ovarian cancers, as
well as in endometriosis (45, 46), we speculate that activation of
GPR30 in a PTEN-deficient genetic background would further
amplify PIP3 signaling and promote tumor proliferation.
The role of GPR30 in endometrial cancer is now worth
considering as cellular studies such as ours, and those surveying
human cancer tissues are being reported. Initial studies linking
GPR30 to endometrial proliferation showed that knockdown of
GPR30 reduced estradiol and OHT-induced growth of Ishikawa
and HEC1A endometrial cell lines, as well as induction of c-fos and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (10). Similarly, we find that both STX and
genistein increase Ishikawa endometrial cell proliferation in a
GPR30-dependent manner. More importantly, GPR30 is prominently expressed in primary human endometriotic H-38 cells. Thus,
activation of GPR30 may underlie the higher risk of endometrium
hyperplasia and/or cancer in postmenopausal women observed
with chronic OHT treatment, but not with aromatase inhibitor
therapy (47, 48). As such, development of drugs that specifically
target this GPR30/SF-1 signaling axis might offer additional
therapies in treating reproductive cancers in the future.
