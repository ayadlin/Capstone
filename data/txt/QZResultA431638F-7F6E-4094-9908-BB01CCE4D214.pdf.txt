ABSTRACT
PARP inhibitors are a class of promising anti-cancer drugs, with proven activity
in BRCA mutant cancers. However, as with other targeted agents, treatment with
PARP inhibitors generates acquired resistance within these tumors. The mechanism
of this acquired resistance is poorly understood. We established cell lines that are
resistant to PARP inhibitor by continuous treatment with the drug, and then used RNA
sequencing to compare gene expression. Pathway analysis on the RNA sequencing
data indicates that NF-κB signaling is preferentially up-regulated in PARP inhibitorresistant cells, and that knockdown of core components in NF-κB signaling reverses
the sensitivity to PARP inhibitor in resistant cells. Of therapeutic relevance, we show
that PARP inhibitor-resistant cells are sensitive to an NF-κB inhibitor in comparison
to their parental controls. Malignancies with up-regulation of NF-κB are sensitive to
bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is currently used in the clinic. We also show
that treatment with bortezomib results in cell death in the PARP inhibitor-resistant
cells, but not in parental cells. Therefore we propose that up-regulation of NF-κB
signaling is a key mechanism underlying acquired resistance to PARP inhibition, and
that NF-κB inhibition, or bortezomib are potentially effective anti-cancer agents after
the acquisition of resistance to PARP inhibitors.

poly-adenosine ribose polymerase (PARP), through a
synthetic lethal mechanism. These observations have been
borne out in early phase clinical trials, with promising
activity of PARP inhibitors both in breast and ovarian
cancers [1–3]. In ovarian cancer, a recent phase II study has
demonstrated a benefit of maintenance PARP inhibition in
the management of metastatic ovarian cancers [4]. As with
all maintenance therapeutic strategies, the development of
resistance to prolonged single agent therapy is inevitable,

INTRODUCTION
Patients with the hereditary breast and ovarian
cancer syndrome (HBOCS) commonly have mutations
in the key genome stability proteins, BRCA1 and BRCA2.
Research over the last decade has yielded a promising
therapeutic strategy for BRCA mutant cancers, through
the observation that cells mutant for the BRCA genes are
exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of the nuclear enzyme

lines harbor homozygous mutation of BRCA1. PARP
inhibitor-resistant clones (R10 and R100 in UWB1.289
and R500 in HCC1937) were developed independently
by repeated exposure to different doses of PARP inhibitor
(Olaparib AZD2281, KU-0059436) (10nM, 100nM
and 500nM, respectively). To generate PARP inhibitorresistant lines, we have used olaparib (AstraZeneca),
a PARP inhibitor that is most advanced in clinical
development, and currently in phase III testing [1–4].
For checking resistance to PARP inhibition, we used 2
distinct compounds- olaparib and rucaparib (AG014699);
Clovis). While olaparib showed promising results in phase
II studies in patients with breast and ovarian cancers
having BRCA mutations [4], rucaparib was initially
established as a radiosensitizer and to potentiate the
effect of temozolamide. Phase II/ III trials are currently
underway for both these agents with preliminary results of
activity in BRCA mutant cancers [14]. Both the olaparib
and rucaparib are bona fide PARP inhibitors and inhibit
both PARP1 and PARP2 [14]. Both of the compounds
have similar potency in inhibiting PARP catalytic
activity [14–16]. The PARP inhibitor-resistant lines show
decreased sensitivity to both olaparib and rucaparib, both
in UWB1.289 setting- R10/R100 (Figure 1A and 1B) and
in the HCC1937 setting- R500 (Figure 1C and 1D).

thus necessitating the study of mechanisms of resistance
and the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome
them. Currently explored mechanisms for acquired
resistance to PARP inhibition include 1. Reversion of the
mutation of BRCA gene [5, 6], 2. Disruption of 53BP1 [7],
3. Up-regulation of p-glycoprotein efflux pump [8] and
4. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 [9]. However,
there are no reports to date of a comprehensive screening
approach to investigate the mechanism of resistance
to PARP inhibition, especially in the context of ovarian
cancer where maintenance PARP inhibitor therapy is of
clinical benefit.
In this paper, we describe our studies comparing
PARP inhibitor resistant and sensitive clones, and
show an up-regulation of Nuclear Factor- κB (NF-κB)
pathways in the resistant clones. NF-κB is a complex of
transcription factors that consisting of p65 (RelA) and
p50 (NFκB1) or RelB and p52 (NFκB2), that are known
to function in the development of acquired resistance to
several other targeted agents [10]. NF-κB signaling has
two major pathways, one is the canonical pathway that
mainly modulates cell proliferation, inflammation or
anti-apoptosis, and the other one is the non-canonical
pathway that mainly controls lymphogenesis and B cell
maturation [11]. In the canonical pathway, p65/p50 NFκB complex are localized in cytoplasm with IκB. Stimuli
such as infection, cytokines, apoptosis-inducers activate
NF-κB in canonical pathway. Binding those stimuli to
their receptors including tumor necrosis factor receptor
(TNFR) or interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor (IL-1R) activates
the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The activated IκB kinase
complex phosphorylates IκB and the phosphorylated IκB
is degraded by β-TRCP-dependent ubiquitination. This
results in nuclear translocation of p65/p50 heterodimer
and activates transcription of NF-κB target genes [10].
In non-canonical pathway, p100, a precursor of p52, is a
central player. p100 binds to RelB and stays in cytoplasm
in non-activated state. Once activated via a binding of
ligands including BAFF (B cell activating factor, a family
member of TNF) to their receptors, p100 is processed to
p52 and RelB/p52 heterodimer is translocated into nucleus
to activate transcription of NF-κB target genes [12].
NF-κB inhibition rescues the sensitivity to anticancer drug in chemoresistant cancer cells, through
TNFα mediated apoptosis, and indeed increases tumor
regression [13]. Thus, NF-κB plays an important role in
chemoresistance, and our paper describes a new role for this
pathway in mediating resistance to PARP inhibition as well.

Validation of reported mechanisms for PARP
inhibitor-resistance
Several mechanisms for acquired resistance to
PARP inhibition have been already proposed [5–9].
Therefore, prior to exploring a new mechanism with a
comprehensive screening in PARP inhibitor-resistant cells,
we have tested whether any of these reported mechanisms
were responsible for PARP inhibitor-resistance in our
PARP inhibitor-resistant lines. One reported mechanism
for acquired resistance to PARP inhibition is a reversion
of BRCA1 gene mutation [6]. Therefore we checked the
sequence of BRCA1 gene. The mutations of BRCA1 genes
are conserved in all the resistant lines (Figure 2A and
2B). Another reported mechanism is disruption of 53BP1
function [7]. Treatment with DNA damaging agents such
as camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, induces
53BP1 foci formation when 53BP1 is functional [17]. All
the parental and PARP inhibitor-resistant UWB1.289 or
HCC1937 cells display similar level of induction of 53BP1
foci formation with elevation of γH2AX signal, a surrogate
marker of DNA double strand breaks, in response to
camptothecin (Figure 2C–2F and Supplementary Figure 1)
[18]. These results suggest that 53BP1 is functional in the
PARP inhibitor-resistant lines. Other reports suggest that
up-regulation of p-glycoprotein efflux pump Abcb1a (as
defined by mRNA expression), is a possible mechanism for
PARP inhibitor-resistance [8]. mRNA expression of Abcb1a
in parental and PARP inhibitor-resistant UWB1.289 or
HCC1937 cells was investigated and the expression of

the Abcb1a is not altered through the lines (Figure 2G
and 2H). An additional mechanism reported for resistance
to PARP inhibition is excess phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6 [9]. However, this is also not applicable in our
PARP inhibitor-resistant clones (Figure 2I). Therefore
we explored a new mechanism for resistance to PARP
inhibition using our clones with acquired resistance, using
a comprehensive screening approach.

EdgeR analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) among the parental, R10 and R100 (parental vs R10
and parental vs R100) [19, 20].

Pathway analysis for acquired resistance to
PARP inhibition
Next we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
to identify the DEGs in the common pathways. IPA is a
web-based software to analyze RNA sequencing data to
understand relation to large biological systems [21]. In
order to obtain meaningful output, we identified DEGs
by log ratio ≥ 2 and p-value ≤ 5.00E-02. In this setting,
we identified 118 DEGs (parental vs R10) and 85 DEGs
(parental vs R100). IPA with DEGs for parental vs R10
or parental vs R100 shows significant enrichment of
genes in category of “Cancer” among the other categories
(Supplementary Table 1). To identify the exact pathway

We performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing
of cDNA libraries derived from parental UWB1.289, and
the PARP inhibitor-resistant clones R10 and R100. We
obtained reads to the order of ~13 million (parental) and ~14
million (R10 and R100) (Supplementary Figure 2). Among
these reads of parental, R10 and R100, 81 to 85% of them

in which DEGs are involved, we performed a pathway
analysis in IPA. Interestingly, 50% or above of DEGs
involved in both the pathways are genes regulated by NFκB signaling (4 genes out of 7 DEG in R10 vs parental and
4 genes out of 8 DEGs in R100 vs parental, highlighted in
bold letter in Table 1). The DEGs were further validated
by network analysis by IPA. This analysis reveals that
the top differential networks are “Collagen type 1-”
and “TNF family-” in parental vs R10 and parental vs
R100, respectively (Table 2). Again both the networks
are enriched in genes regulated by NF-κB signaling
(highlighted in bold letter in Table 2). IPA predicts
upstream transcriptional regulators from the global
change of mRNA expression. The upstream prediction
also reveals enrichment of NF-κB regulators such as
TNF, STAT3, IL1 and IL1A (Table 3). In summary, IPA
analysis predicts that up-regulation of NF-κB signaling
occurs in PARP inhibitor-resistant cells, on the basis of upregulation of genes regulated by NF-κB signaling. Aside
from the upstream classification of DEGs, we have also
tried to identify common downstream signaling pathways
that DEGs are involved using the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. While IPA
performs analysis with DEGs that are both up-regulated
and down-regulated simultaneously, KEGG performs
analysis with DEGs either up- or down-regulated.
Therefore we picked up up-regulated DEGs defined as
log ratio ≥ 1.5 and p-value ≤ 5.00E-02 for analysis with
KEGG. This threshold generates 307 and 314 DEGs in

parental vs R10 and parental vs R100, respectively. This
analysis revealed that pathways of cytokine-cytokine
receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)
are significantly enriched (Table 4). In particular, cytokines
and chemokines that are upstream effectors as well as
downstream products of NF-κB signaling, such as IL1β
and CCL20, are up-regulated in PARP inhibitor-resistant
cells (both in R10 or R100) compared to the parental.
These results suggest that NF-κB pathway is preferentially
activated in PARP inhibitor-resistant cells.

NF-κB signaling is up-regulated in resistant cells
To confirm that NF-κB signaling is up-regulated in
PARP inhibitor-resistant cells, we performed quantitative
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) to measure upstream effectors and downstream
transcription products of NF-κB signaling. From IPA and
KEGG analysis, we selected a panel of genes involved
in TNFα signaling and NF-κB signaling including TNF
receptor family, TNF ligands superfamily members, antiapoptotic genes, and genes that stimulate inflammatory
response such as Toll-like receptor family, cytokines,
chemokines and p38, an activator of NF-κB through
STAT3 activation (see Supplementary Table 2). Almost
all these genes are indeed increased in both the PARP
inhibitor-resistant cells (R10 and R100) compared to
parental UWB1.289 cells (Figure 3A). RT-PCR shows
almost the same agreement with RNA sequencing

data, which is 95% similarity (19 of 20 genes). We also
attempted to validate these findings using the breast
HCC1937 cell lines (parental and R500). Interestingly,
while the mRNA of TNF ligands superfamily members,
p38, cytokines and chemokines are increased in R500
compared to parental cells, TNF-receptor family members,
anti-apoptotic genes or genes that stimulate inflammatory
response are not altered in the resistant cells compared to
parental (Figure 3B). However 70% of the list of the genes
involved in NF-κB signaling increases the expression
in PARP inhibitor-resistant cells. These results suggest
that NF-κB signaling is up-regulated in PARP inhibitor
resistant cells.
In canonical NF-κB signaling, to activate the
transcription of target genes, the p65/p50 subunits of
NF-κB are translocated into the nucleus [10]. Therefore we
measured nuclear retention of p65 in parental or resistant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells, using quantitative high content microscopy. Prior
to the experiment, we checked the quality of the anti-p65
antibody and the quantitative high content microscopy.
For the quality check of the antibody, p65 was knocked
down using siRNA in UWB1.289 cells and the cells
were stained with the anti-p65 antibody. The signal
of p65 is significantly reduced by the siRNA for p65
(Supplementary Figure 3A). We proceeded to measure
the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of p65 using NucTrans.V4
algorithm in the cellomics HCS system. For a quality check
of our quantitative high content microscopy protocols, the
effect of a stimulator and an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling
were measured. TNFα is used as a stimulator and BAY
11–7082, an IKKα inhibitor is used as an inhibitor of the
signal [22]. Indeed, TNFα increases nuclear retention of
p65, as defined by our protocol, and the effect of TNFα is
inhibited by treatment with BAY 11–7082 (Supplementary

Figure 3B and 3C). Therefore, we have performed further
experiments using these settings. In UWB1.289 cells, ~7.5
percent of cells have nuclear accumulation of p65 in
parental cells. In contrast, ~15.2 or ~13.2 percent of cells
have accumulated p65 in nucleus in resistant R10 or R100
cells (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 4A). Similar
results are observed in HCC1937. There is more p65 in
nucleus in resistant R500 cells than in parental cells (~4.1
percent vs. ~0.6 percent, respectively) (Figure 3D and
Supplementary Figure 4B). Furthermore, we measured
NF-κB activation with NF-κB responsive luciferase
reporter gene assay. TNFα induces luciferase activity and
the effect of the TNFα is diminished by treatment with
BAY 11–7082 (Supplementary Figure 3D), confirming the
validity of this assay. In UWB1.289 cells, PARP inhibitorresistant cells show a more than two fold increase in
transcriptional activity (~19.5 in parental to ~59.1 or ~43 in
R10 or R100 respectively) (Figure 3E). In HCC1937 cells,
R500 shows almost 3 fold increase compared to parental
cells (~43.7 in parental to ~124.3 in R500) (Figure 3F).
Thus these results suggest that at least a subset of

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NF-κB signaling is indeed up-regulated in PARP inhibitorresistant cells. Finally, we confirm the effect role of NF-κB
signaling in mediating PARP inhibition by knockdown of
p65, a central component in NF-κB signaling in sensitivity
to PARP inhibitor. Strikingly, reduction of p65 reverses the
sensitivity to PARP inhibitor in PARP inhibitor-resistant
lines both in UWB1.289 and HCC1937 (Figure 3G–3J).

PARP resistant cells are sensitive to NF-κB
inhibition, and Bortezomib treatment
In accordance with a central role for NF-κB signaling
in mediating resistance to PARP inhibitors, we show that the
PARP inhibitor-resistant UWB1.289 or HCC1937 clones
(R10, R100 and R500) are sensitive to an NF-κB inhibitor
BAY 11–7082 compared to the parental cells (Figure 4A
and 4B). Bortezomib a proteasome inhibitor, also impacts
on the NF-κB pathway through protection of IκBα from the
proteolysis by ubiquitin proteasome system [23]. Whether
bortezomib works as an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling is
controversial [24, 25], but it has been demonstrated that

bortezomib kills cells with up-regulated NF-κB signaling
[26]. As the drug is currently approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration for clinical use in the treatment of
Multiple Myeloma [27], we checked the cellular sensitivity
to bortezomib in UWB1.289 or HCC1937 cells. As expected,
bortezomib kills PARP inhibitor-resistant cells derived
from UWB1.289 preferentially compared to the parental
cells (Figure 4C). This effect is also observed in HCC1937
(Figure 4D). We further tested whether bortezomib inhibits
or activates NF-κB signaling in the PARP inhibitor-resistant
cells. Bortezomib indeed decreases nuclear retention of p65
preferentially in PARP inhibitor-resistant lines compared to
parental UWB1.289 (Figure 4E) or HCC1937 cells (Figure
4F), suggesting that it seems to inhibit NF-κB signaling in
the setting of acquired PARP resistance.
This prompted us to check if bortezomib could be used
to reverse the PARP resistant phenotype of our cell lines.
The sensitivity to bortezomib in parental and PARP inhibitorresistant clones does not differ up to 200nM in UWB1.289
and 4nM in HCC1937 (Figure 4A and 4B). Therefore the
sensitivity to PARP inhibition in conjunction with a low
dose of bortezomib (30nM for UWB1.289 and 500pM for
HCC1937) was assessed. As expected, bortezomib increases
the sensitivity to PARP inhibition in PARP inhibitor-resistant
cells preferentially (Figure 4G and 4H). These data suggest
that inhibition of NF-κB signaling is an effective therapy for
PARP inhibitor-resistant cancers, and that inhibition of NFκB signaling reverses cellular sensitivity to PARP inhibition
in resistant cells.

signaling without up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene
serves for the acquired resistance is not known. The
information of the exact mechanism may help to develop
a better therapy for chemoresistant malignancies.
Finally, we propose inhibition of NF-κB is an
effective anti-cancer therapy for malignancies for acquired
resistance to PARP inhibition. NF-κB inhibitors are still
not used as practical clinical medicines because of toxicity
and specificity [28]. On the other hand, while bortezomib
is not a typical NF-κB inhibitor, it does have a negative
influence on the pathway in most contexts, and is clinically
approved [27]. Furthermore, co-treatment with bortezomib
may allow a reversal of the acquired resistance to PARP
inhibition. Further study is needed to develop this idea
for clinical use to benefit patients who progress on PARP
inhibitor therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
UWB1.289 and HCC1937 cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C.

Generation of PARP inhibitor-resistant clones
To generate PARP inhibitor-resistant clones,
UWB1.289 cells were continuously exposed to different
doses of PARP inhibitor (10nM or 100nM). The cells were
split every other day for 5 months. In HCC1937, cells
were exposed to PARP inhibitor (500nM). The cells were
split every other day for 3 months.

DISCUSSION
The mechanism of acquired resistance to PARP
inhibitor has been extensively studied and several models
have been proposed [5–9]. Because all the mechanisms
suggested were not applicable in our resistant lines,
we screened an ovarian cancer cell line (which is the
most clinically applicable context for continuous PARP
inhibitor therapy [4]) by RNA sequencing, and note
increased NF-κB pathway activation. Interestingly,
up-regulation of NF-κB signaling is known to cause
acquired resistance to other agents apart from PARP
inhibitors [13].
We have shown that mRNA of genes that are
involved in NF-κB signaling are altered in expression
when the cells acquire resistance to PARP inhibition. The
precise mechanism by which these NF-κB related mRNAs
are up-regulated is not known, and will be the subject of
future work in the lab.
NF-κB has an anti-apoptotic effect and it has been
thought that increased anti-apoptotic effect by up-regulated
NF-κB signaling plays an important role in acquired
resistance [13]. Interestingly, genes that are involved in
anti-apoptosis are not up-regulated both in UWB1.289
and HCC1937 in our setting. How up-regulated NF-κB

Cell viability assay
Cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of
1000 cells per well. Different doses of drugs were added,
and the plates were incubated at 37°C for a week. Cells
were fixed with 75% methanol in 25% acetic acid for
5 min, and the plates were dried. Colonies were stained
with Lillie’s crystal violet (2 g crystal violet, 0.8 g
ammonium oxalate in 100 ml of 80% ethanol) for 5 min
and subsequently washed with water, dried, and measured
by ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE healthcare).

Genomic DNA collection
Cells were lysed with 0.5% NF-40 lysis buffer. Once
cells were dissolved, same volume of 100% phenol TE was
added, then centrifuged at maximum speed. Supernatant
was collected and same volume of isopropanol was
added, and mixed well, then centrifugation. The pellet
was washed with 70% ethanol once and dissolved with
appropriate volume of water.

protocol as suggested by the manufacturer. Primers for
sequencing are CTGGTACTGATTATGGCACTCAGG
for UWB1.289 and CTTAAAGTCCCAGCTCTTCCAC
for HCC1937.

Western blots
UWB1.289 and HCC1937 cells were transfected
with siRNA using Lipofectamin RNAiMAX (Life
Technologies) transfection reagent following manufacturer
protocol. RNAi for p65 and non-targeting siRNA were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Western blots
were done as described previously [29], briefly 48 hours
after transfection, cells were lysed with 0.5% NP-40 lysis
buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 50mM NaF, 1mM DTT, 1mM Na3VO4, complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1mM PMSF) and
resolved by SDS-PAGE

Immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured on 96 well plastic plates (BD
Falcon). 24 hours later, cells were treated with 3uM of
Camptothecin for 1 hour, when required. The cells were
fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes. Then cells
were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton-X100 for 5 minutes and blocked with 3% BSA in
PBSt for 15 minutes. Followed by blocking, cells were
incubates with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature, then cells were washed three times with
PBSt followed by incubated with secondary antibodies for
30 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with
Hoechest 33342 (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 15 minutes and
analyzed by Cellomics Cellinsight high content screening
reader (Thermo Scientific).

RNA quality control and library preparation
Total RNA was quantified and purity checked using
a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). RNA integrity was verified using an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). Subsequently, 500 ng of total RNA were used with
the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit (Illumina,
San Diego, CA) to construct index-tagged cDNA libraries.
Libraries were quantified using a Quant-iT™ dsDNA HS
assay with the Q-bit fluorometer (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, California). Average library size and the size
distribution were determined using a DNA 1000 assay in
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were normalized
to 10 nmol/L using Tris-Cl 10 mmol/L, pH8.5 with 0.1%
Tween 20.

Antibodies
The antibodies and dilution used in this study
were: Anti-γH2AX (Ser139) antibody (Millipore,
05–636, 1:1000); Anti-53BP1 antibody (Novus
Biologicals, NB100–304, 1:1000); Anti-ribosomal protein
S6 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 2217, 1:1000);
Anti-phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236) antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, 4858, 1:2000); and Anti-α/
β-tubulin antibody (NeoMarkers, DM1A, 1:5000);
Anti-p65 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 8242, 1:500
for IF and 1:1000 for WB); Anti-β-actin (SIGMA, AC-15,
1:1000); secondary antibodies (Alexa Flour, 1:1000).

RNA sequencing and data analysis
Total RNA derived from PARP inhibitor-resistant or
parental UWB1.289 cells were isolated by trizol and whole
transcriptome analysis was performed. The sample of each
cells were technical replicated. Cutadapt was used to trim
Illumina adapters and to remove those reads that were too
short. Filtered reads were then aligned with Rsem against
the GRCh37.p11 collection of transcripts. Each RefSeq
gene’s expression was summarized and normalized using
EdgeR bioconductor R package. Differentially expressed
genes were identified with coverage (more than 1 at least
one sample) and fold change (more than 1.5). Biological
functions and network analysis of differentially expressed
genes were performed using KEGG that is included in
DAVID gene ontology (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) as
well as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (http://www.
ingenuity.com/) [30, 31].

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of transcript levels
in UWB1.289 and HCC1937 were performed using a
StepOnePlus™ real time PCR system (applied biosystems,
Warrington, UK). Total RNA was extracted using an
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Valencia, CA),
and cDNA was synthesized using a PrimeScriptTM
RT Master Mix (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was performed
using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (applied
biosystems) as follows: 15 min at 95C and then 45
cycles of 15 sec at 95C and 60 sec at 60C. Data were
analyzed by the cycle threshold method to determine
the fold changes in expression. Relative abundance

Plasmids
For NF-κB activation assays in UWB1.289 and
HCC1937 cells, we used an NF-κB site–containing
luciferase reporter plasmid. For normalization and control,
we used a luciferase reporter without the NF-κB site–

5 × 106 of UWB1.289 cells or 3 × 106 of HCC1937
cells were transfected with 14ug of NF-κB firefly
luciferase reporter vector and 1μg of pRL-TK renilla
luciferase vector. For control, UWB1.289 or HCC1937
cells were transfected with 14μg of pGL3 basic firely
luciferase reporter vector with 1μg of pRL-TK renilla
luciferase vector. Transfections were carried out with
Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V in Nucleofector (Lonza)
using program A-023. Cells were cultured in 2ml of
RPMI-1640 medium in a 12-well plate. Luciferase
assay was performed using Dual Luciferase Assay kit
(Promega) per manufactures instructions. Luciferase
activity was measured at 48 hours post transfection.
For measurement, 30μl of each renilla and firefly
substrate were injected into 30μl out of 120μl of cell
lysate. Luciferase signals of firefly were divided by
renilla signals and standard error of the mean (SEM) of
triplicated experiments was calculated.
