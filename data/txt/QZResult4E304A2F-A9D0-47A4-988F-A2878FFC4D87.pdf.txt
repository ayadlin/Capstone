ABSTRACT:
Kinesin motor proteins exert essential cellular functions in all eukaryotes.
They control mitosis, migration and intracellular transport through interaction
with microtubules. Small molecule inhibitors of the mitotic kinesin KiF11/Eg5 are a
promising new class of anti-neoplastic agents currently evaluated in clinical cancer
trials for solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Here we report induction of
Eg5 and four other mitotic kinesins including KIF20A/Mklp2 upon stimulation of in
vivo angiogenesis with vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Expression
analyses indicate up-regulation of several kinesin-encoding genes predominantly
in lymphoblasts and endothelial cells. Chemical blockade of Eg5 inhibits endothelial
cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Mitosis-independent vascular outgrowth
in aortic ring cultures is strongly impaired after Eg5 or Mklp2 protein inhibition.
In vivo, interfering with KIF11/Eg5 function causes developmental and vascular
defects in zebrafish and chick embryos and potent inhibition of tumor angiogenesis
in experimental tumor models. Besides blocking tumor cell proliferation, impairing
endothelial function is a novel mechanism of action of kinesin inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

to induce and sustain new blood vessel growth [2].
Neutralizing VEGF-A with drugs such as the humanized
anti-VEGF-A antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) potently
blocks tumor growth in numerous animal models.
Associated with standard chemotherapy, bevacizumab is
used worldwide against multiple cancer types and allows
prolonged or progression-free survival. However, by far
not all patients respond to anti-VEGF therapy and severe

The ability of solid tumors to attract blood vessels
(tumor angiogenesis) is one of the rate-limiting steps
for tumor progression [1]. Vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF-A) is a key hypoxia-induced angiogenic
protein secreted by tumor cells acting on the endothelium

side effects such as hypertension and proteinuria have
been reported, a fact which has led to the retirement of
bevacizumab as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer
[3]. It is therefore a challenge to explore the molecular
networks that regulate blood vessel growth to identify
novel druggable targets.
To discover novel downstream effectors of VEGF-A
activity in the endothelium in vivo, we monitored global
gene expression changes after application of recombinant
human VEGF-A on the differentiated day-13 chick
chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) [4]. Numerous known
genes associated with angiogenesis were up regulated
by VEGF-A. Among the new ones, KIF4A, KIF11/Eg5,
KIF15, KIF20A/Mklp2 and KIF23, all genes encoding
mitotic kinesins, were consistently up regulated.
Kinesins make up a family of about 45 proteins
in humans; at least 12 of them are implicated in mitosis
[5]. KIF11 encodes the Eg5 protein, which is essential
for cell division [6]. Murine Knsl1 (KIF11) null-embryos
die prior to implantation between morula and blastocyst
stage [7, 8]. KIF20A/Mklp2 exerts important functions
during mitosis by ensuring cleavage furrow formation and
cytokinesis [9].
First evidence that kinesin inhibition might be
explored as a new anti-cancer strategy came in 2004 [10]
and chemical inhibitors of Eg5 have been designed and
tested with success against solid tumors in preclinical
tumor models [11]. Consequently, there are increasing
numbers of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of Eg5
inhibitors alone or associated with classical chemotherapy

in hematological and solid malignancies [12]. There is
a general consent that inhibitors of the mitotic kinesins,
especially Eg5, have the potential to overcome side-effects
associated with classical microtubule targeting agents
such as Taxol, which include neutropenia, hair loss and
peripheral neuropathy as well as resistance, thereby often
limiting their usability [5, 13].
Mitotic kinesins have been studied in the context
of cell division almost exclusively in tumor cells [12].
Beside their role in mitosis, an increasing number of
reports point to the possibility that they may exert other
biological functions. KIF11/Eg5 plays an important
role in normal and cancer cell migration [14, 15]. Only
recently, an important role of Eg5 in protein translation
has been discovered [16] and KIF4A has been shown to
be implicated in neuronal survival [17]. Since KIF11/
Eg5 and KIF20A/Mklp2 are promising drug targets,
we sought to investigate the impact of their respective
inhibitors on angiogenesis, a process that is central to
tumor progression.

recombinant VEGF-A was deposited on the differentiated CAM at day 13 of development. (a, b, c) 24h later, tissue with visible newly
formed capillaries (asterisk in c) was isolated and further processed for mRNA isolation (n=3 CAMs per group). Control CAMs (a) did
not show any vascular alterations (arrow: border of the carrier plastic disc). (d) To verify reproducibility of these experiments, foldchange values of genes regulated in VEGF-treated CAMs were plotted against each other for correlation analysis. Significant correlations
(Spearmans r ranging from 0.7 to 0.78, P<0.0001) were found for all comparisons indicating that VEGF effects on the CAM were consistent.

In silico endothelial-enriched ortholog genes (q-value <0.5) regulated more than 2-fold in at least 2 of 3 comparisons are shown (n=53). As expected, and
consistent with active vascular network formation, numerous key angiogenic regulators were induced, such as TEK, CD34, SOX18, LMO2, PECAM1,
NRP1, FLI1 and KDR (italicized). Also note induction of mitotic kinesins, KIF11 (encoding Eg5) and KIF20A (in bold). 317 probe sets with significant
increase after VEGF-A stimulation in at least two out of three comparisons are shown in Supplemental Table S1.

Kinesin expression and localization

individual CAMs was performed. 317 probes showed
significantly increased expression (more than 2-fold in
at least two out of three comparisons; Table S1). Foldchanges of significantly regulated genes in VEGF-Astimulated CAMs replicates showed strong correlation
(Spearman R ranging from 0.7 to 0.78, P<0.0001 in all
comparisons: VEGF CAM 1 vs. VEGF CAM 2, VEGF
CAM2 vs. VEGF CAM 3, VEGF CAM 1 vs. VEGF CAM
3; Fig. 1d).
An automated reciprocal blast search identified
human orthologs of the 317 chick genes and an in silico
prediction of endothelial vs. non-endothelial expression
of these revealed those with expression enriched in
endothelium [19, 25]. 206 human ortholog genes were
identified and submitted to gene ontology (GO) using
the DAVID interface (Table S2). Interestingly, GO
terms associated with mitosis were highly significantly
enriched (11.6-fold, FDR: 7.44x10-13). Another annotation
cluster identified GO term “blood vessel development”
(enrichment 5.5-fold, FDR 1.66x10-4). A total of 53 single
genes with human orthologs and preferential endothelial
expression (q-value >0.5) were identified (Table 1). This
list contained numerous key angiogenic regulators with
known endothelial expression indicating that relevant
biological material was isolated for microarray analysis.
One of the genes with strong up-regulation and
specific prediction of endothelial cell over-expression
was KIF11 (coding for the Eg5 protein), a molecule that
has not yet been studied in the context of angiogenesis.
Up-regulation of a total of five kinesins by VEGF-A was
confirmed by semi-quantitative qPCR and was 4.79 for
KIF4A, 3.8 for KIF11, 6.25 for KIF15, 5.58 for KIF20A
and 2.95 for KIF23 using HNRPH1 as normalizer
because its expression did not differ between control and
VEGF-treated CAMs (Supplemental Table S1, last line).
Increased production of Eg5 protein was further confirmed
in vitro, after stimulating HUVECs with VEGF165
protein. Increase in Eg5 protein could be abolished by
simultaneous application of the neutralizing anti-VEGF
antibody Avastin (Fig. S1).

We performed an in silico bioninformatic screen
[25] on all genes encoding kinesins. Eight out of 38
kinesin transcripts showed enrichment in the endothelial
EST pool more than two-fold, including the VEGF-Ainduced kinesins KIF11, KIF15 and KIF20A (Table S3).
In freshly isolated human foreskin, Eg5 staining
overlapped to a great extent with that of CD31, indicating
that blood endothelial cells strongly express Eg5 protein
(Fig. 2a). Lymphatic vessels identified by podoplanin
immunoreactivity were also Eg5 positive (Fig. 2b).

Figure 2: Eg5/KIF11 expression studies in normal and
cancerous tissues. (a, b) Sections of human foreskin were

double-stained with anti-Eg5 and either anti-CD31 or antipodoplanin antibodies. CD31-positive blood capillaries were
also positive for Eg5 (arrows). (b) Colocalisation of Eg5 and

(c) Immunohistological staining reveals also expression of Eg5
in tumor blood vessels in three different glioblastoma patients

renal cell carcinoma patients (arrows).

Immunohistological analysis of human glioblastoma
samples revealed staining of Eg5 in endothelial and tumor
cells (Fig. 2c). In renal cell carcinoma, predominant
staining was observed in capillaries (Fig. 2d). Mklp2/
KIF20A protein showed an even stronger expression in
endothelial cells in several normal tissues (heart, placenta,
endometrium, oral mucosa; Fig. S4a-d) and glioblastoma
vessels (Fig. S4e, f). KIF20A transcripts were found
mostly in ECs in glioblastoma (n=4 patients, arrows; Fig.
S4h), matching the vascular localization of CD31 (Fig.
S4g). All five VEGF-induced kinesins are over expressed
in a large number of human malignancies as evidenced by

Oncomine analysis (Fig. S2a). In small cell lung cancer,
fibrosarcoma and glioblastoma, these kinesins are found
up regulated, compared to normal tissue (Fig S2b-d).
We further focused on KIF11 and KIF20A expression in
glioblastoma and found general over-expression in this
pathology in two additional studies (Fig S3, left graphs).
When expression values were plotted individually per
patient, a heterogeneous expression pattern was revealed
with about one third of patients under- expressing KIF11
and KIF20A, whereas two-thirds of patients over-express
both genes (Fig S3, right graphs).
To further shed light on the co-expression of the

KIF11 gene as bait (Fig. S5a). Expression was low in
normal brain, but elevated in anaplastic oligodendroglioma
(French_brain study1) and all five kinesins were highly

co-expressed (correlation from 0.903 for KIF4A to 0.872
for KIF15; black arrows). Similar co-expression could be
evidenced in a glioblastoma study (Freje_brain study; Fig.

features such as the vascularization state of a tumor, as
evidenced in the Wurmbach_liver study for hepatocellular

levels increased with the degree of vascularization
and were highest in tumors with macroscopic vascular
invasion.
We also used data provided by the BioGPS project
[26] to compare KIF11 and KIF20A expression in 84
human tissues and cell lines. Only 8 cell lines had relative
KIF11 mRNA levels higher than 20 (Fig. S7), highest
levels were found in 721_B_lymphoblasts (274.8),
followed by other lymphoblastic lines and CD105+ and
CD34+ endothelial cells (167.95 and 64.75). Highly
comparable data were found for KIF20A, relative
expression values of KIF11 and KIF20A were highly
correlated (Spearman r=0.8492, P<0.0001). These
expression data point to a potential role of kinesins in the
angiogenic process.

is a very rare event in our assay conditions (Fig. S8).
These results demonstrate that kinesin inhibition affects
biological processes relevant for angiogenesis, which are
distinct from mitosis.

Kinesin inhibition affects endothelial
adhesion, spreading and migration

Vascular chord formation requires cell adhesion
and migration. Eg5 function is required for proper cell
adhesion of HUVECs plated on different matrix proteins.
Ispinesib-treated cells (5 µM) adhered poorly and
detached after washing prior to Coomassie staining (Fig.
S9a). Cells appeared more rounded and phalloidin staining
revealed an altered organization of the actin cytoskeleton,
with an appearance of cortical actin and strong reduction
of stress fibers (Fig. S9b). Quantification of the number
of spreading cells revealed a significant decrease after
Eg5 blockade using ispinesib (P<0.0001, Fig. S9c).
Endothelial cell migration was measured over an 18h
time period. Migrating HUVECs in serum and DMSO
control wounds covered around 90% of the denuded area
(Fig. S10a, b), whereas Ispinesib-treated cultures were
covered by 36% and paprotrain cultures only by 28%
(P<0.0001; Fig S10c). A comparable result was obtained
in a second series of experiments after siRNA-mediated
knock-down of KIF11 in HUVECs. Wound closure after
20h of migration was reduced by 31% compared to control
cultures (P=0.0007; Fig. S10d).

Eg5 blockade inhibits proliferation of endothelial
cells and tumor cell lines
Growth of HUVECs and LECs was inhibited by
dimethylenastron (DMN) in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3a-c). Inhibition became evident after 72h of
treatment with first effects at 0.5 µM and maximal effects
at 1 µM. Significant growth inhibition at doses from 0.5
to 1 µM was also observed in the brain microcapillary
endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 (Fig. 3d), and bovine
aortic endothelial cells (BAE) stimulated with VEGF-A
or FGF-2 in reduced growth medium (Fig. 3e). Eg5
blockade at 1 µM led to complete growth inhibition after
72h, regardless of the type of mitogen used (Fig. 3i).
Similar inhibition was observed in the human malignant
glioma cell lines U87 and T98G (Fig. 3f, g), the murine
glioma cell lines GL261 (Fig. 3h), and five different
neuroblastoma cell lines (Fig. 3i).

Vascular outgrowth in the mouse aortic ring assay
is inhibited by kinesin blockade
We next tested effects of Eg5 and Mklp2 inhibition
in an ex vivo angiogenesis model where spontaneous
vascular growth occurs after incubation of aortic rings
in matrigel [27]. After 8 days of treatment, vascular
outgrowth around rings was significantly inhibited at
ispinesib doses as low as 50nM (P<0.0001; Fig S11a, b),
whereas paprotrain-mediated inhibition was effective only
around 20µM (P<0.001; Fig. S11a, c).

KIF11/Eg5 and KIF20A/Mklp2 inhibition
interferes with in vitro angiogenesis in the absence
of mitosis
Strong perturbation of in vitro angiogenesis was
observed after Eg5 blockade using two specific inhibitors,
dimethylenastron (DMN; Fig. 4b) and ispinesib (ISP; Fig.
4c and Video 1), whereas solvent-treated cultures were not
affected (Fig. 4a and Video 2). Inhibition was observed
with ispinesib at both doses (5 and 10 µM). Number of
vascular chords was reduced by 2-fold, branching points
by nearly 90%, independent chords increased 3-times and
number of loops was reduced by 90% (Fig. 4e-h). Less
potent inhibition was observed with the Eg5 inhibitor
DMN (Fig. 4e-h). Chemical blockade of Mklp2/KIF20A
protein using paprotrain also inhibited chord formation
(Fig. 4d), albeit at higher doses (20 µM) and to a lesser
extent than the KIF11/Eg5 inhibitors (Fig. 4e-h). Mitosis

was only observed in the ISP treatment groups, ranging
from 8% at 0.1 µM, up to 18% at 1 µM. Analysis of
live embryos revealed changes in the morphology of
the posterior blood islands (PBI) as well as a reduction
of circulating blood cells (Fig. 5d). This phenotype did
not occur in control embryos, but up to 15% of embryos
displayed these modifications at 1 µM (P=0.0067) and
3 µM ISP (P=0.0041), suggesting that the developing

hematopoietic system is sensitive to Eg5 inhibition.
We therefore examined expression of kif11 in
24hpf embryos; a time point where a transient wave of
hematopoiesis takes place in the PBI and circulation
begins [28]. A fli1 probe visualized cellular components
of the developing blood vascular system, including the
PBI. The kif11 probe labeled various cellular components
of the embryo with different intensities; strong staining

was evident in the PBI and PCV (posterior cardinal vein),
where a partial co-localisation with the fli1 signal was
observed (Fig. S12a).
Morpholino-mediated knock down of the kif11
gene in the transgenic Tg(kdrl:EGFP)s843 line had severe
effects on embryonic morphology and survival (Fig.
5e). Whereas almost all control morpholino embryos
developed normally, the number of dead and affected
embryos increased even at a morpholino dose of 0.2 ng
(P<0.005; 0.2 ng vs. controls). At 0.5 ng, effects were even
more severe and 70% of embryos were dead. At the lower
dose, embryos appeared curved and severe phenotypes had
pericardial edema (Fig. 5f, arrow). Various morphological
defects occurred in the developing vasculature, ranging
from shortened inter-somitic vessel (ISV) sprouts (Fig. 5g;
first two arrows), discontinuity of the dorsal longitudinal
anastomotic vessel (DLAV) (asterisk, mild phenotype)
and branching defects (third arrow). Embryos with
severe phenotypes had complete absence of the DLAV
and shortened and distorted ISV sprouts (arrows; more
examples are shown in Fig. S12b).
These results – together with the high expression
levels of KIF11 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells –
suggest that Eg5/KIF11 might be a novel target for antiangiogenic therapy in pathological settings.

In a murine tumor model, RENCA cells implanted
orthotopically in kidneys give rise to highly aggressive and
fast growing tumors with tumor weights of up to 4 g after
a 3-weeks period (median 1.9 g; Fig. 6j, k). Twice-weekly
treatment with ispinesib potently reduces tumor weight
(median 708 mg; P=0.0037) and tumor angiogenesis
(P=0.0184; Fig. 6l, m).
When established tumors were treated for 48h
with ispinesib, no growth reduction or effect on vessel
density was observed (Fig. 6n, o). However, tumor
vessel in treated animals appeared more dilated and had
a significantly higher number of dilated vessels (Fig 6p;
P=0.0284).

DISCUSSION
It is widely accepted that the secreted growth
factor VEGF-A and its transmembrane receptors, are key
regulators of embryonic and pathologic angiogenesis
[2]. The angiogenic switch is a key event during tumor
progression [1] and there has been much hope that antiVEGF-A therapies may inhibit tumor growth significantly.
In practice, anti-VEGF strategies have their limitations,
due to a limited number of therapy responders, severe
side effects of the VEGF-targeting antibody Avastin and
raising concerns about the high costs of such treatment
[3]. However, VEGF-A is a major proangiogenic factor in
vivo, and therefore, it is of crucial importance to identify
new druggable targets, which are associated with its
downstream functions.
We chose the chick embryonic day-13 chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), since human VEGF-A
specifically induces angiogenesis in this tissue [4]. A
global analysis of regulated angiogenesis genes in vivo
is more reliable than in vitro transcriptome analysis of
angiogenic endothelial cells, since major molecular
differences have been found when endothelial cells are
studied separated from their normal tissue context [29,
30].
Numerous genes up-regulated by VEGF-A have
not yet been studied in the context of angiogenesis such
as members of the kinesin family of motor proteins.
We investigated the effects of kinesin inhibition on the
angiogenic process in vitro and in vivo, focusing on Eg5/
KIF11 and Mklp2/KIF20A.
Our bioinformatics analysis and immunostaining
results of normal human foreskin (Fig. 2) show that KIF11/
Eg5 is strongly expressed in blood and lymphatic vascular
ECs. Human foreskin ECs also express VEGFR-2, a
marker of angiogenic capillaries [31]. Only cells from the
hematopoietic lineage (normal or neoplastic), together
with CD34+ and CD105+ endothelial cells also displayed
high levels of KIF11 and KIF20A kinesins (Fig. S7).
An observation in line with these results is the strong
expression of kif11 in the posterior blood islands of
zebrafish embryos. In addition, inhibition of Eg5 function

Interfering with KIF11/Eg5 function reduces
tumor angiogenesis
Experimental gliomas grown on the chicken CAM
are accessible to topical treatment with chemical tyrosine
kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate or PTK787
[23]. During the three-day anti-Eg5 treatment period,
no measurable tumor size reduction occurred. However,
biomicroscopic observation of the tumors at day 4 showed
increasing whitish areas at the tumor surface (Fig. 6ad). These areas contain necrotic cells, as confirmed by
subsequent histology (Fig. 6f-h). Immunohistological
analysis of the tumors showed reduced numbers of
angiogenic capillaries after treatment with a single dose
of DMN per day (Fig. 6f). This effect was much stronger
after two DMN doses; the tumors were almost completely
devoid of blood vessels, whereas tumor cells apart from
the necrotic areas appeared normal (Fig. 6g). Tumor cell
morphology evidenced by vimentin staining was not
altered by DMN treatment, even at the highest doses. Two
treatments of ispinesib caused widespread destruction
of cellular components of the tumor as evidenced by
non-specific staining of dead cells for sambucus nigra
agglutinin (SNA lectin), clearly visible below the surface
(Fig. 6h). A significantly higher number of ispinesibtreated tumors were found in the poorly vascularized
group (P<0.005) and accordingly, only a small number
of ispinesib-treated tumors were classified in the highly
vascularized group (P<0.005; Fig 6i).

by ispinesib in this model leads to modification of this
structure or reduced number of blood cells. In humans,
neutropenia is a frequent side effect of anti-kinesin therapy
[32], suggesting that Eg5 function is also required for
generation and maintenance of immune cells.
Morpholino-mediated knock-down of kif11 results
in vascular pattern defects in the trunk vasculature (Figure
5 e-g, Fig. S12b). These results point to an important
function of KIF11/Eg5 in the endothelial cell lineage.
Besides endothelial cell proliferation, other
biological processes such as chord formation also require
Eg5 and Mklp2. Recent insight from genetic studies
further support the notion that KIF11 is required for
development of normal retinal and lymphatic vessels,
since KIF11 mutations cause autosomal-dominant
microcephaly associated with lymphedema and/or
chorioretinopathy [33].
Cell adhesion, spreading and migration that
are critical for vascular chord formation are strongly
perturbed by Eg5 and Mklp2 inhibition (Figs. S9, S10).
We observed a modification of the cytoskeleton in cells
treated with ispinesib, with an increase of cortical actin
and strong reduction of stress fibers. These changes
in the cytoskeleton are most likely responsible for the
reduced migratory and adhesive capacity after Eg5
inhibition. Just recently, it has been shown that Eg5 also
has a function in normal and malignant cell migration
[14, 15]. There is evidence from the literature that DMN
is highly specific for Eg5 kinesin, it binds to a region of
the protein composed of loop 5, helix α2 and α3, which
is not conserved in other kinesins [34, 35]. ISP, the
second inhibitor we used ISP has been shown to be more
than 70.000-times more selective for Eg5 than for other
kinesins [36]. Further, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
the KIF11 gene reduced cell migration comparable to
chemical inhibition.
Interestingly, all five kinesins induced by VEGF-A
are also present in the highly significant 67-gene signature
termed CINSARC (complexity index in sarcomas),
which is associated with poor clinical outcome in several
cancer types [37]. It is tempting to speculate that VEGFA-induced kinesins contributes to bad prognosis in
human cancers or reflects the state of an activated tumor
endothelium. Significant co-expression of these five
kinesins has also been evidenced by bioinformatic analysis
in various malignant tumors, especially in brain tumors
(Fig. S5). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), increasing
kinesin (co-) expression is furthermore associated with the
vascular status of the tumors (Fig. S6). Another group has
just recently confirmed overexpression of KIF20A in HCC
[38].
As expected, Eg5 inhibition stops glioblastoma
cell growth [39]. Eg5 inhibitors not only block
proliferation of adult tumor cell lines, but also those
derived from childhood tumors. In the progressed stage 4
neuroblastoma, the 5-year survival rate is only 20 – 30%
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[40] and high vascular density is characteristic for the
progressed neuroblastomas [41]. Further studies should
investigate the efficacy of anti-kinesin treatment in this
kind of malignancy.
In the light of our in vitro results on Eg5/KIF11
inhibition of endothelial cells, it can be expected that
Eg5 inhibition might have a dual effect as it affects both
malignant cells and tumor vasculature. Inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis in the short-term experimental glioma model
[23] was the predominant effect observed, suggesting that
the endothelium constitutes an important target for this
inhibitor.
Oncomine expression data show that KIF11
transcripts are not overexpressed in kidney cancer,
however, we have found Eg5 protein expression in
capillaries of RCC and just recently, Eg5 immunoreactivity
has been evidenced in a large study using 164 patient
RCC tumors, with higher expression predicting poor
disease outcome [42]. Eg5 inhibition significantly reduces
experimental kidney cancer growth and angiogenesis.
Short-term anti-Eg5 treatment did not alter tumor vessel
density or led to regression of vessels, but changed
vascular morphology. Tumor capillaries were significantly
more dilated in the treatment group, suggesting a
vascular remodelisation effect of ispinesib. Even though
classical anti-VEGF agents generally causes vascular
“normalization” including reduction of vessel diameter
[43], dilatation of tumor capillaries after different antiangiogenic treatments has recently described in animal
models as well in human tumors [44, 45]. Different
treatment durations and drug combinations may account
for these differences; however, our results show that the
tumor vasculature is affected by Eg5 inhibition.
This may open up new therapeutic perspectives such
as targeting kinesin inhibitors to the tumor endothelium
and stroma [46] to enhance the therapeutic efficacy.
Furthermore, combination of small-molecule Eg5
inhibitors with anti-angiogenic agents may reduce side
effects or increase the number of responders to antiangiogenesis treatment. Eg5 blockade not only inhibits
VEGF-A-induced cell proliferation, but also FGF-2
stimulated proliferation and thus has a more broadrange effect than specific VEGF inhibitors (Fig. 3e).
It is therefore tempting to speculate that Eg5 inhibition
might render endothelial cells refractory to growth stimuli
secreted by tumor cells, thereby maintaining a potent antiangiogenic environment.
Even though single anti-angiogenic treatment
works well in animal models, combination with standard
chemotherapy is needed for most tumor types to obtain
results in patients. A special emphasis should be given
to the fact that cells from the hematopoietic lineage
overexpress Eg5 (and Mklp2). Patients suffering from
these highly proliferative malignancies might benefit
from kinesin inhibition due to its dual anti-proliferative
and anti-angiogenic effect. Since a frequent side effect

of Eg5 inhibitors is neutropenia, efforts should be made
to develop specific cell and tumor targeting kinesininhibition strategies to enhance their efficacy.
Evidence is emerging that over expression of KIF4A
and KIF18A may play roles in tumor progression [47, 48].
Furthermore, knock-down of the KIF23 gene has been
shown to abrogate glioma cell proliferation and tumor
growth in vivo [49]. This opens the perspective that other
kinesins may serve as druggable targets for anti-cancer
therapy.
Taken together, our results provide evidence that
kinesins, which lay downstream of angiogenic growth
factors signaling, mediate essential processes important
for physiological and pathological vascular growth and
may constitute a potential therapeutic target for antivascular tumor therapy.

Identification of genes regulated by VEGF-A on
the CAM

Chemical inhibition of Eg5 in chick embryos

Chick embryos were handled as described [18].
RNA was extracted from three CAMs treated each with
3µg of recombinant human VEGF-A and compared
individually to pooled equivalent quantities of RNA from
three normal CAMs. Affymetrix chicken microarrays were
processed as published [19]. Bioinformatic analyses of
kinesin expression are detailed in the supplemental data
section.

Chick embryos were injected with 3 µl of
dimethylenastron (1 µg/µl) at Hamburger & Hamilton
(HH) stage 21 (3.5 days) into the allantoic vesicle (n=20
embryos). Control embryos (n=15) received equal volume
of solvent (DMSO). Embryos were examined under a
biomicroscope the following day at stage HH24.

Semi-quantitative PCR

All zebrafish experiments were carried out
using standard procedures (described in supplemental
material and methods). In brief, Tg(kdrl:EGFP)
s843
embryos [22] were microinjected at the 1-2
cell stage with 0.2-1 ng kif11 morpholino (MO)
(CTGGTACTTGTGATGATGCCATGTT;
Gene Tools, USA) or standard control MO
(CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA; Gene Tools,
USA). Higher kif11 MO doses were lethal and did not
allow further analysis. At 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf),
embryos were phenotype-scored and photographed. For
chemical Eg5 inhibition, normal zebrafish embryos were
treated with indicated doses of ispinesib at 24 hpf and
phenotype-scored at 48 hpf.

Zebrafish experiments

To verify microarray data, semi-quantitative PCR
was performed on the same material used for microarray
hybridization using efficient primers against VEGFR1,
VEGFR2, KIF4A, KIF11, KIF15, KIF20A and KIF23,
normalized to HNRPH1, which shows no changes during
normal CAM development [19] and which is not induced
by VEGF (Supplemental Table S1, last line).
