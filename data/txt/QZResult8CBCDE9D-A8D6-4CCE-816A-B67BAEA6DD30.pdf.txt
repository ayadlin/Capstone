ABSTRACT
Background: The detection of BRAFV600 mutations in patients with metastatic
melanoma is important because of the availability of BRAF inhibitor therapy. However,
the clinical relevance of the frequency of BRAFV600 mutant alleles is unclear.
Patients and Methods: Allele frequencies of BRAFV600 mutations were analyzed
by ultra-deep next-generation sequencing in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
melanoma tissue (75 primary melanomas and 88 matched metastases). In a second
study, pretreatment specimens from 76 patients who received BRAF inhibitors were
retrospectively analyzed, and BRAFV600 allele frequencies were correlated with
therapeutic results.
Results: Thirty-five patients had concordantly BRAF-positive and 36 (48%)
patients had concordantly BRAF-negative primary melanomas and matched
metastases, and four patients had discordant samples with low allele frequencies
(3.4–5.2%). Twenty-six of 35 patients with concordant samples had BRAFV600E
mutations, three of whom had additional mutations (V600K in two patients and
V600R in one) and nine patients had exclusively non-V600E mutations (V600K in eight
patients and V600E -c.1799_1800TG > AA- in one patient). The frequency of mutated
BRAFV600 alleles was similar in the primary melanoma and matched metastasis
in 27/35 patients, but differed by >3-fold in 8/35 of samples. BRAFV600E allele
frequencies in pretreatment tumor specimens were not significantly correlated with
treatment outcomes in 76 patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with
BRAF inhibitors.
Conclusions: BRAFV600 mutation status and allele frequency is consistent in
the majority of primary melanomas and matched metastases. A small subgroup of
patients has double mutations. BRAFV600 allele frequencies are not correlated with
the response to BRAF inhibitors.

dabrafenib resulted in response rates of over 50–60% and
progression-free survival (PFS) of 6–7 months. Among
nonresponders in these trials, the majority had an initial
period of disease stabilization, and only a minority had
primary resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy [1, 2].

INTRODUCTION

Precise selection of patients is crucial for optimal
use of BRAF inhibitor therapy. BRAF mutations may be
detected in archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) melanoma tissue; however, it is currently unclear
whether primary tumors, consecutive metastases, or
both should be preferentially analyzed because of the
possibility of intertumor heterogeneity [3]. It is also
unclear whether the allele frequency of BRAFV600E
mutations is correlated with response to BRAF kinase
inhibitors. Thus in the first study population, we evaluated
BRAFV600 mutations and allele frequencies in FFPE
melanoma specimens using ultra-deep next-generation
sequencing (NGS) and compared the results in primary
melanomas and matched metastases. In a second study

population we used NGS to evaluate BRAFV600
mutations in pretreatment melanoma specimens from
76 patients with metastatic melanoma who subsequently
received BRAF inhibitors, and examined correlations
between BRAFV600 allele frequencies, PFS, overall
survival (OS), and objective response.

RESULTS
BRAFV600 mutational status was determined by
ultra-deep NGS in 163 FFPE tissue samples obtained
from 75 patients (Table 1 and 2). The primary melanoma
and consecutive metastases from one, two, and three

and higher in the metastases than the primary melanoma in
19 patients (Table 1, Figure 1). In 27 of 35 (77%) patients
with BRAFV600 mutations, the percentage of mutated
alleles in the primary melanoma and metastases differed
by <3-fold. In the eight patients in whom the percentage of
mutated alleles in the primary melanoma and metastases
differed by >3-fold, the frequencies of mutated alleles
was higher in the primary melanoma in four patients and
higher in the metastases in four patients. The differences in
allele frequencies between primary and metastatic tissue in
six of these eight patients could be attributed to differences
in tumor cell content in the various tissues.

BRAFV600-positive, and in the one remaining patient
the metastatic tissue alone was BRAFV600-positive
(Table 1). Of note, the BRAFV600 allele frequencies were
low (3.4–5.2%) in the positive samples from these four
individuals (Table 1).

BRAFV600E (c.1799T > A) mutations and rare
mutations by NGS
Among the 35 patients with concordantly BRAFpositive samples, 26 patients had a BRAFV600E
(c.1799T > A) mutation in both the primary melanoma
and consecutive metastases, eight patients had BRAF
V600K (c.1798_1799GT > AA) mutations (eight primary
melanomas, four lymph node metastases, and four
skin metastases), and one patient had a BRAFV600E
(c.1799_1800TG > AA) mutation (in the primary melanoma
and matched skin metastasis) (Table 1). Three metastatic
specimens from these 35 patients (two skin metastases
and one lymph node metastasis) showed BRAFV600K
(c.1798_1799GT > AA, n = 2) or BRAFV600R
(c.1798_1799GT > AT; n = 1) mutations with an allele
frequency >3%, in addition to BRAFV600E (c.1799T > A).

Allele frequencies of patients treated with BRAF
inhibitors and their impact on therapy outcome
Pretreatment samples from 76 patients with
BRAFV600E-positive metastatic melanoma who were treated
with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib (n = 67) or dabrafenib
(n = 9) were retrospectively analyzed by NGS. The baseline
characteristics and response to therapy after a mean followup of 11.4 months are summarized in Table 3. The available
samples included nine primary melanomas, 29 lymph node
metastases, 28 cutaneous or subcutaneous metastases, eight
visceral metastases, and two brain metastases. As shown in
Table 3, BRAFV600E (c.1799T > A) allele frequencies in
pretreatment melanoma tissue were ≤5% in two patients, >5–
10% in four patients, >10–15% in three patients, >15–20% in
11 patients, > 20–25% in 6 patients, >25–50% in 33 patients,
and >50% in 17 patients.
Allele frequencies were not significantly
correlated with either PFS or OS in Kaplan-Meier

Frequencies of mutated BRAFV600 alleles in

in primary melanomas and 26% in consecutive metastases

primary melanoma than in the metastases in 16 patients,

analyses in which different cut-offs were used (≤15%,
≤18%, ≤20%, and ≤25%). Comparisons of PFS and OS
in patients with allele frequencies ≤18 and >18% are
shown in Figure 2 (p = 0.374 for PFS and p = 0.898
for OS). Odds Ratio was calculated to determine the
magnitude of differences that can be detected with this
relatively small cohort (Table 4).
The response to therapy (complete response [CR]
and partial response [PR] versus stable disease [SD], mixed
response [MR], and progressive disease [PD]) was not
significantly correlated with allele frequencies in univariate
analyses in which different cutoffs were used (15%, 18%,
20%, and 25%). A total of 9, 15, 20, and 26 patients had
BRAFV600E allele frequencies ≤15%, ≤18%, ≤20%, and
≤25%, respectively. Response rates (CR and PR) in these
categories were as follows: BRAFV600E allele frequency
≤15% versus >15% (44% and 61%, p = 0.473); ≤18%
versus >18% (40% and 64%, p = 0.142); ≤20% versus
>20% (45% and 64%, p = 0.185); and ≤25% versus >25%
(50% and 64%, p = 0.326).

matched metastases and their influence on the outcome of
BRAF inhibitor therapy.
For the first time, we showed that type and
frequency of BRAFV600 mutations are consistent in the
primary melanoma and matched metastases in the majority
of patients. In most patients with discordant BRAFV600
status, in which one tissue sample was positive and
one sample negative, this could be explained by low
allele frequencies where the allele frequency was close
to the threshold of detection in the positive sample but
below the threshold of detection in the negative sample.
Differences in allele frequencies could also be explained
by differences in tumor cell content in the specimens.
These results suggest that, in the majority of melanoma
cases, the BRAF mutation status of the primary tumor is
retained in metastases, and that primary and/or metastatic
tissue can be used for routine mutational analysis provided
that sufficient tumor cell content is available.
Five recently published studies have analyzed
the BRAF mutation status of melanoma samples with
different molecular methods (Table 5). Consistent
with our observations, these analyses also found the
mutational status of primary tumor and metastatic tissue
to be concordant in the majority of cases. Intrapatient
homogeneity of BRAF mutations has also been reported
in all patients (n = 64) included in a recent study that used
immunohistochemical methods for detection of BRAF
mutants [5].
Our findings suggest that melanomas can be
heterogeneous with regard to BRAFV600 mutations. The
allele frequency was below 50%, which would be the

DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of BRAF mutations
in melanoma in 2002 [4], advances in molecular
characterization of the disease have led to the development
of specific BRAF inhibitors that are now available for the
treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. In the first
part of this study, we used ultra-deep NGS to assess the
BRAFV600 mutation status of primary melanomas and

expected result if cells show a consistent heterozygous
mutation. For example, patient number 2 showed allele
frequencies that ranged from 18.7% to 25.6% in the
primary tumor and three metastatic samples (Table 1).
The results of a study that used a BRAFV600E-specific
antibody and showed heterogeneous staining in 13 of 58
(22%) melanoma samples provides further evidence of
heterogeneity of BRAFV600 mutations [6]. Moreover, a
further study that used single cell suspensions to assess
BRAF mutations found 9 of 10 primary melanomas and 0
of 3 metastases to be heterogeneous [7].
Despite these data that suggest BRAFV600
mutations are heterogeneous, the clinical response to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BRAF inhibitors is homogenous [1, 2] and suggests that
the BRAFV600 mutation is relevant in the majority of
melanoma cells.
Approximately 10% of patients with BRAF
V600 mutations had double mutations, comprised
of the BRAFV600E and an additional rare mutation.
This phenomenon has not been reported previously
and demonstrates the ability of NGS to detect different
mutations that are difficult or impossible to detect
with techniques used in other studies, such as Sanger
sequencing, pyrosequencing or melting curve analyses
[3, 8–11]. This phenomenon may also be the result of
intratumor heterogeneity.

Allele frequencies had no impact on PFS, OS,
and objective response rates in the 76 patients with
BRAFV600E-positive metastatic melanoma treated
with BRAF inhibitors. Although the usual precautions
regarding retrospective analyses apply, the median PFS of
7.1 months and the response rate of 60% are very close
to the results of the phase III studies [1, 2], supporting
the validity of our findings. These results are also in
line with the recently published observation of Wilmott
et al. that the intensity and distribution of BRAFV600E
immunohistochemical staining is not correlated with
clinical outcomes [6].
The observation that patients with allele
frequencies <18% and ≥18% have similar PFS and OS is

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

clinically relevant, because an allele frequency of 18%
is around the detection limit of Sanger sequencing [12],
which is commonly used in routine clinical practice.
Thus, in the case of a negative Sanger sequencing result,
our data suggest that retesting with a more sensitive
assay may be worthwhile to detect alleles that may be
present at lower frequencies.
In conclusion, we show here that BRAFV600
mutation status and allele frequency are consistent
in the majority of primary melanomas and matched
metastases, that a subgroup of patients has double
mutations, and that the allele frequency of melanoma
tissue is not correlated with treatment response in our
patient cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

enriched beads were loaded on a 454 Junior Sequencer
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Demultiplexing and variant
calling was done with the Amplicon Variant Analyzer v2.7
software from Roche. The average sequencing coverage of
BRAF was >5000. The presence of a BRAFV600 mutation
was defined as the presence of a non-reference base in a
minimum of 3% of reads.

Patients
In the first study population we retrospectively
analyzed melanoma samples from patients with metastatic
melanoma who were treated at the Skin Cancer Center
Hannover, Germany, between 1995 and 2011. Patients
were selected for this study on the basis of availability
of primary melanoma tissue and tissue from at least one
matched metastasis.
In a second different study population, BRAFV600
allele frequencies were determined by NGS in
pretreatment melanoma tissue specimens from metastatic
melanoma patients who were treated with BRAF
inhibitors at three German skin cancer centers (Munich,
Erfurt and Hannover). Patients had been treated with
standard dosages of vemurafenib (960 mg b.i.d.) in a
phase III clinical trial [13] or expanded access program,
or dabrafenib (150 mg b.i.d.) in phase III clinical trials
[14]. Only patients with BRAFV600E mutations and
with pretreatment FFPE tumor specimens available for
NGS analysis were included. Patients with non-V600E
mutations and patients with double mutations were
excluded.
Response to therapy in the clinical trials was
assessed with computed tomography every 8–12 weeks, as
required by the protocols [13, 14]. Tumor responses were
determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [15].

Approval by ethics committee
The collection of clinical and follow-up data,
performance of mutational analyses, and correlation with
clinical data was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Hannover Medical School (vote 1849-2013).

Statistical analyses
Associations between BRAFV600E allele
frequencies and clinical outcomes were tested by logrank test (Kaplan-Meier analyses) using different allele
frequencies as cutoffs (15%, 18%, 20%, and 25%).
Qualitative comparisons of objective response to therapy
with BRAF inhibitors were performed using RECIST
1.1 criteria. In these comparisons, responders were
defined as having either a CR or PR and nonresponders
were defined as having SD, an MR, or PD. Analyses of
responses to therapy (response versus nonresponse) and
allele frequencies were performed by using a two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test. Statistical significance was defined as
an alpha level <0.05. SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL,
USA) was used for Kaplan-Meier tests, Fisher’s exact test
and calculation of Odds ratio (OR).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

One slide at the beginning of each serial section was
stained with hematoxylin-eosin and histopathologically
examined to determine the tumor cell content. Only
samples with a tumor cell content of at least 30% were
included in this study. The area of interest was circled on
the stained slide and macrodissection was performed on
the corresponding unstained slides using a scalpel. DNA
was extracted using the cobas® DNA Sample Preparation
Kit (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany).

Ultra-deep NGS
Isolated DNA (350–976 ng) from all FFPE
specimens was subjected to analyses by NGS using a
Roche GS Junior System to detect BRAFV600 mutations
on exon 15. The NGS procedure was done according
to the manufacturer’s specifications [16]. Amplicon
processing, library preparation and emulsion PCR were
done according to the manufacturer’s directions for the
GS Junior Titanium Series (Roche). Around 500,000
