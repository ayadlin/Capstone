BACKGROUND: The prognosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in the elderly is poorer than that of younger patients after
treatment with all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy, which is the current standard therapy for APL. A significantly higher mortality during consolidation therapy was found, which is mainly due to deaths from sepsis following chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. METHODS: A total of 33 patients aged 60 years or older with de novo APL were treated with single-agent arsenic trioxide
(ATO) for remission induction and postremission therapy. The postremission therapy continued for up to 4 years. RESULTS: Twentynine patients (87.9%) achieved a hematologic complete remission, and the most common adverse event during remission induction
was leukocytosis (63.6%). Definite differentiation syndrome was observed in 5 patients. Nonhematologic adverse events were all
manageable and reversible. Twenty-eight patients proceeded to postremission therapy. Adverse effects during postremission therapy
were mild, transient, and no treatment was required. No patients died from ATO-related toxicities. With a median follow-up of 99
months, the 10-year cumulative incidence of relapse, overall survival, disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival were 10.3%,
69.3%, 64.8%, and 84.8%, respectively, which are comparable with those in the younger APL partners. No significant risks for development of chronic arsenicosis or second malignancy were observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate
that the single-agent ATO regimen is safe and effective with long-term durable remission, and could be used as first-line treatment

KEYWORDS: acute promyelocytic leukemia, elderly patient, arsenic trioxide, first-line treatment.

The combination of all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy is currently the standard approach to
newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and has yielded encouraging clinical outcomes in adult patients.
However, the treatment for elderly APL patients remains a challenge. APL is rarely seen in the elderly population aged 60
years or older. The proportion of elderly patients with APL is only 12% to 24% in most series.1-3 Compared with that in
young adults, the prognosis of APL in the elderly is poorer after treatment by the current standard approach due to both a
higher incidence of early deaths and a significantly higher mortality found during consolidation therapy, when about 15%
of the patients died in hematologic complete remission (HCR), mainly from sepsis during the phase of myelosuppression
induced by chemotherapy.4 Although a reduction of chemotherapy intensity has been proposed for patients in this age
group to reduce treatment-related toxicities, the clinical implications remain unclear because of the potential increase of
relapse risk.1,5 In addition to higher mortality, elderly APL patients are often accompanied with a series of comorbidities,
some of which represent an absolute contraindication to the current standard treatment.1,2,5 Effective treatment
approaches that are particularly suitable for elderly APL patients are highly desired.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO), as a single agent, is most commonly used at present in cases of relapsed APL for induction
of remission. It has been shown that it is equally effective in newly diagnosed cases of APL, with much less toxicity.6-8
Therefore, for the elderly APL patients, especially for those truly frail patients who are considered unfit for chemotherapy, ATO could be a reasonable alternative to the current standard approach.9 However, ATO is not commonly used as
the first-line drug for remission induction in de novo APL cases, nor is it used for postremission therapy. The main concern is that long-term administration of ATO, which is best known as a poison, would render patients at high risks for
developing chronic arsenicosis or a second malignancy.10 The results based on our 5-year follow-up study showed that
a single-agent ATO regimen is highly efficacious and safe for the treatment of children with newly diagnosed APL.11

This report deals with the 10-year follow-up results of a
single-agent ATO regimen for treatment of elderly
patients with de novo APL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The study was open to elderly patients diagnosed with de
novo APL in the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China, from March 1996 to
December 2002. During this period, a total of 38 consecutive patients 60 years or older were diagnosed with APL.
Of these patients, 5 were excluded due to refusal of treatment. Thus, 33 patients were enrolled in this study,
regardless of performance status or comorbid disease. The
diagnosis of APL was based on clinical presentation, the
characteristic French-American-British M3 bone marrow
(BM) morphology, and was subsequently confirmed by
cytogenetic assay for t(15;17) translocation. In 10 patients
whose diagnosis was only made on a morphological basis
without cytogenetic confirmation, review of initial marrow slides by an expert morphologist was mandatory.
This study was started in 1996, when reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction was not widely available in
China, and thus polymerase chain reaction information
was not used for the diagnosis. Written informed consent
was required, and the study protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Provincial Medical Ethics Committee.
Treatment Protocol

For remission induction, ATO (0.16 mg/kg/day, for a
maximum of 10 mg/day; Harbin Yida Pharmaceutical
Company, Harbin, China) was prepared in 5% glucose or
0.9% sodium chloride (for patients with diabetes) solution. The total daily dose was infused intravenously over 3
to 4 hours/day for 28 days. After an intermission of 5 to 7
days, the drug was administered again until the presence
of all of the following: no clinical evidence of APL, sustained platelet count exceeding 100  109/L for at least 5
to 7 days, no blasts or promyelocytes in blood, and less
than 5% blasts plus promyelocytes in the BM, or to a
maximum of 56 doses.
In patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts
greater than 20109/L at admission, adjusted-dose DA
(daunorubicin at 40 mg for 3 days; Ara-c [cytosine arabinoside] at 50-100 mg for 5 days) was administered and a
semi-dose of ATO was given simultaneously. For patients
with leukocytosis (WBC count greater than 10  109/L)
after ATO treatment was initiated, the ATO dose was
reduced and hydroxyurea (1.0-2.0 g/day) was taken orally
if the WBC counts exceeded 20  109/L; ATO was dis116

continued temporarily and hydroxyurea (3.0 g/day) was
administered when the WBC count was higher than 40 
109/L. For patients with cardiac, liver, or renal diseases at
admission, the primary disease was treated aggressively.
Depending on magnitude of organ dysfunction, full-dose
or semi-dose of ATO was administered continuously or
intermittently, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), liver, and
renal functions were monitored closely. ATO was discontinued or reduced if a grade 3 to 4 toxic event or differentiation syndrome occurred during the induction phase.
After resolution of the above events or recovery to baseline
status, ATO was then increased to its full dose.
For patients with a leukocyte count greater than 20
 109/L, oral or intravenous (according to cardiac and renal function) NaHCO3 and oral allopurinol were commonly administered, and no extra hydration was required.
For patients with severe edema, frusemide was given and
albumin was used to correct hypoalbuminemia. During
the ATO therapy, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations were kept above 4 mEq/dL and 2 mg/dL,
respectively.
Patients who achieved an HCR could receive up to 4
years of postremission therapy. The therapy was carried
out on an outpatient basis. The schedule of ATO administration for postremission therapy is detailed in Table 1.
For every ATO course during postremission therapy, a
complete blood count was conducted before the administration of ATO and was repeated once per week thereafter. Postremission therapy would be intensified in some
cases from our experience. In detail, the duration of this
course would be extended to 14 days whenever blasts plus
promyelocytes in BM increased to 4% to 5% or if before
initiation of a course of ATO treatment, the WBC count
was on the high side of the normal range (8-10  109/L)
with a normal differential count. If the WBC count on
the high side did not decrease markedly after 14 days of
ATO administration, the duration of this course would be
further prolonged to 21 days.
Safety Evaluation

During induction therapy, complete blood cell counts
and liver and renal functions were closely monitored.
ECGs were required at least twice per week. Throughout
postremission therapy and for at least 3 years after completion of all therapy, complete physical examinations
were performed every 3 months for liver function, renal
function, electrolytes, ECGs, dermatological consultations, and detailed neurological examinations. BM morphology analysis was performed every 6 months until
HCR had been sustained for 5 years.

To monitor the body retention of arsenic due to
long-term administration of ATO, arsenic levels in urine,
nails, and hair, which are good indicators of long-term
exposure and in vivo accumulation of arsenic, were measured as described11 in 17 long-term survivors at the last
follow-up visit and in 17 healthy controls matched for
age, sex, and geographic location, who had never received
therapeutic ATO.
Outcome Definitions

Early death was defined as death within the first week of
treatment. HCR and hematologic relapse were defined as
reported.11 Because only few molecular data were available after 2004, molecular remission and molecular
relapse were not considered in the study.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time
from initiating treatment to death from any cause; causespecific survival (CSS) was calculated as the time from the
first day of the therapy to death attributed to APL disease
or ATO treatment; disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated from time of achieving HCR to an event (relapse,
other malignancy, or death from any cause). In the
absence of these events, patients were censored at the last
visit.
Statistical Considerations

This is a geriatric study with long-term follow-up where
mortality unrelated to the study itself was substantial.
Historically, survival following APL treatment in elderly

patients has been reported, using all-cause survival analysis. CSS analysis, which focuses on the impact of a disease
process and a therapeutic modality on survival and had
been widely used in other long-term follow-up studies of
elderly patients, was used here to reduce the impact of the
unrelated deaths on survival rates.12
Univariate associations between dichotomous variables were evaluated with the Fisher exact test. The Student’s t test was used to compare arsenic levels between
the patient group and the healthy control group. The follow-up of the patients was initiated from the date of HCR
and updated on December 2009. The survival analysis
was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method using
SPSS software, version 15.0. The survival estimates are
reported 1 standard error. The probability of relapse
was estimated by the competing risk approach.13 All
patients are included in intent-to-treat analysis, regardless
of not receiving allocated postremission therapy on
protocol.
RESULTS
Initial Patient Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the 33 elderly patients are
shown in Table 2. Of the 29 patients who had at least 1
comorbidity, 24 required specific treatment when admitted to the hospital. Five patients had chronic hepatitis B
infection and 3 of them developed hepatic cirrhosis. Five
patients had suffered from psoriasis and received

bimolane treatment for 8 to 43 years (median, 22 years)
before leukemia onset.
Response to Induction Therapy

Of the 33 patients, 29 (87.9%) achieved HCR. There
were 3 early deaths at day 4, 6 and 7, respectively during
the induction therapy resulted from cerebral hemorrhage.
The other patient died on day 19 due to secondary uncontrolled sepsis.
The median time to BM remission (ie, elimination
of all visible leukemic cells on BM aspirate review) was 32
days (range, 22-48 days). The median time to HCR was
57 days (range, 39-70 days) with a median dosage of 400
mg (range, 310-520 mg). The median times for recovery
of the platelet count (100  109/L or higher) and absolute neutrophil count (1.5  109/L or higher) were 36
days (range, 0-49 days) and 55 days (range, 39-66 days),
respectively. When HCR was achieved, the hemoglobin
level, which was neither an index for withdrawing induction therapy nor that for HCR in APL, was 64-132 g/L
(median, 89 g/L), and it generally returned to normal in 1
to 2 weeks.
Of the 29 patients who achieved HCR, all but 3 had
a characteristic leukocytic response to ATO induction.
First, the WBC counts increased gradually by a median of
8.6 times (range, 1.6-34.2 times) after initial treatment of
ATO. The median peak WBC level was 19.4  109/L
(range from 3 to 139.5  109/L), and reached at a median of 13 days (range, 3-21 days) following ATO administration and then the elevated WBC counts declined
gradually to the lowest level ranged from 0.2  109/L to
3.4  109/L (median, 1.1  109/L) within median of 21

days (range, 11-33 days). Eventually, the low WBC
counts went up again until back to normal. The WBC
counts for the rest 3 patients had no significant change
during induction therapy.
Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between baseline WBC count, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and response to
induction therapy (Table 2).

Adverse Events During Induction Treatment

Adverse events during ATO induction therapy are summarized in Table 3. The most common adverse events
were leukocytosis. Of the 33 patients, 21 (63.6%) developed leukocytosis in response to the ATO treatment apart
from 4 cases (12.1%) who had a high WBC count at presentation. Low-dose DA was administered in 1 patient
and hydroxyurea was applied in 11 patients. Definite
differentiation syndrome, which is often a severe or lifethreatening complication, occurred in 5 patients with
fever, edema, dyspnea, orthopnea, bilateral pleural effusion, and/or hydropericardium, and was evidently associated with severe leukocytosis (range of the peak WBC
level from 28.6  109/L to 139.5  109/L). These
patients were all treated successfully by controlling progressive leukocytosis, temporary discontinuation of ATO
and administration of dexamethasone for 3 to 5 days.
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in 19 patients
(57.6 %). With the exception of 1 patient who died of a
sepsis, there were no severe or life-threatening infectious
events. However, 1 patient without previous history of
herpes zoster developed a herpes zoster infection during

the induction therapy without relationship to dexamethasone administration.
Nonhematologic adverse events such as ECG abnormalities, gastrointestinal reactions, liver dysfunction,
edema were all manageable and reversible. Other nonhematologic adverse events were all transient and mild, and
no further management was required.
For patients with elevated levels of liver enzymes and
abnormal ECGs at admission, management of primary hepatic disease and cardiac disease, symptomatic treatment
such as protecting liver, reducing enzyme levels, anti-arrhythmia, and ATO induction were given simultaneously,
after which liver enzyme levels or abnormal ECGs would
usually return to normal or baseline when HCR was
obtained. No treatment-related deaths were recorded.
It was found that for most comorbidities, such as
hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic hepatitis,
and hepatic cirrhosis, as long as there was no organic function damage, administration of ATO seldom induced
more toxicity, whereas in patients with ECG abnormalities, respiratory failure, heart failure, or abnormal liver or
kidney function, adverse events of ATO therapy occurred
more frequently. For examples, ECG changes were
observed in 12 of 18 patients (66.7%) with abnormal
baseline ECG which is significantly higher than 4 of 15
patients (26%) with normal baseline ECG (P ¼ .037).
Regarding patients with peptic ulcer or diabetes, ATO
induction sometimes caused severe gastrointestinal reaction or abnormally high blood sugar levels.
In general, 14 patients had ATO decline or temporary discontinuation due to grade 3 or 4 adverse events
(6 cases) or/and severe leukocytosis (12 cases). All of
them were able to resume treatment and subsequently
obtained a HCR.
Clinical Outcomes

Three patients underwent hematological relapse at 23, 28,
and 31 months after achieving HCR. Of these, 2 patients
had declined postremission therapy before relapse
occurred due to personal request. One of the 2 patients
who firmly refused postremission therapy after each HCR
had 4 relapses (23, 33, 38, and 41 months, respectively)
within 18 months. Following repeated ATO induction
therapy, this patient achieved HCR 3 times, but eventually died of a cerebral hemorrhage in the fourth relapse.
The other 2 patients both attained a second HCR after
repeated ATO induction and have remained in the second
HCR for 53 and 65 months, respectively. No ATO resistance has been found in this series. Eight patients died in
HCR (see details in Table 4).
120

With a median follow-up of 99 months (range,
51-158 months) for all surviving patients, the 10-year
cumulative incidence of relapse was 10.3% and the 10year estimates of OS, DFS, and CSS were 69.3%  8.1%,
64.8%  10.2%, and 84.8%  6.3%, respectively
(Fig. 1). In the CSS analysis, one ATO treatment–independent death from liver cancer was not considered as an
event. The data of survival analysis indicated that in this
series the 10-year mortality associated with APL or ATO
treatment was only 15.2% while 15.5% deaths was APL
or ATO treatment independent.
What should be noted here is the long-term outcomes
of the 5 cases with secondary APL. Of these, 1 died in the
fourth relapse, 1 was lost to follow-up after 109 months,
and the other 3 were still alive at the last follow-up.
Tolerance of Postremission Therapy and
Long-Term Toxicity

Of the 29 patients who achieved HCR, 28 were subjected
to postremission therapy. The postremission therapy continued for up to 4 years in this study. Except for 2 patients
who died during postremission therapy, the remaining 26
patients completed the programmed postremission
therapy. Among these 26 patients, 21 cases had ever
undergone intensified postremission therapy. The cumulative ATO doses in 24 cases without relapse were
2245-3380 mg (median, 3060 mg), whereas the doses in
the 2 relapsed patients were 4670 mg and 5180 mg,
respectively.
The periodic ATO infusion regimen was well tolerated for all 26 patients who completed the postremission
therapy, including the 2 relapsed patients with higher cumulative ATO doses. Although headache, gastrointestinal
reactions, and neutropenia occasionally occurred during
the therapy, all these adverse effects were mild, transient,
and needed no treatment.
The evaluation on the long-term toxicity demonstrates that until the final follow-up, neither obvious
symptoms of chronic arsenicosis (such as liver and kidney
damage, neuropathy, skin lesion, limb muscle atrophy,
among others10) nor second malignancy had been
observed, with the exception of 1 patient who had longstanding hepatitis B virus infection and hepatic cirrhosis,
died of liver cancer 117 months after HCR, and the death
was apparently independent of ATO treatment.
To monitor the toxicity of the ATO treatment,
urine arsenic concentrations and arsenic contents in nails
and hair were analyzed at the last follow-up visit in 17
long-term survivors, apart from 3 cases who were lost to
follow-up. There had been no significant difference in

neutropenia, and then the recovery of WBC counts. Based
on decades of our clinical observations, the treatment
response can be found in more than 90% of patients with
APL, whereas it never occurred in the cases with other
diseases, suggesting that the characteristic leukocytic
response to ATO induction is highly sensitive and specific
and may serve as a further validation of the diagnosis of
APL. In fact, this response was observed in all but 3
patients in this series.

long-term survivors, who had no hematological relapse after hematologic complete remission, with lower cumulative doses of arsenic trioxide (range, 2360-3150 mg; median, 2970 mg) and longer off-treatment duration (range, 36-110 months; median, 52
months) were included, whereas the other 2 patients, who had ever relapsed, with higher cumulative doses of arsenic trioxide
(4670 mg and 5180 mg, respectively) and shorter off-treatment duration (5 and 17 months, respectively), were excluded. ~ indicates the detection results of the 2 patients who had ever relapsed.

In this study, ATO was administered in a low dose
to patients with APL for a long period of time, in contrast to much shorter periods of treatment in all other
single-agent studies.7,8 It is in our hospital that ATO
was initially attempted for clinical treatment of APL in
the 1970s,15 and these treatment strategies are mainly
derived from our previous clinical experiences: 1) We
found that in adult patients, the toxic effects of ATO
had much to do with its daily dose. A high daily dose of
ATO for patients with excessive body weight often
results in a notable increase in the incidence of severe
ventricular arrhythmia and differentiation syndrome.
Yet, as long as the maximum daily dose of ATO is limited to 10 mg, the increase can be avoided without
affecting the therapeutic effect. 2) During postremission
therapy, multiple short-course (7 days) regimens were
used with the intermissions between courses prolonged
gradually from 2 weeks to 6 weeks within the first year
and sustained at 6 to 8 weeks during the next 3 years
122

(Table 1). This treatment strategy can obviously reduce
the occurrence of chronic arsenicosis such as numbness
in extremities, skin pigmentation, and is especially suitable for senile patients who have a relatively slow drug
metabolism rate. 3) The duration of postremission therapy was particularly long. Here, the duration of postremission therapy was mainly determined by the relapse
risk. Originally, the duration of postremission therapy
was much shorter. After a time, it was found that relapse
seldom occurred during the treatment period but often
happened at 1 to 3 years after treatment cessation.
In contrast to the tendency to develop all-trans
retinoic acid resistance, patients could always obtain a
second HCR after repeated ATO induction and seldom
developed ATO resistance. Accordingly, it was inferred
that the relapse was largely due to the too-short duration
of postremission therapy, and thus the duration of postremission therapy was gradually lengthened. It has been
found that the DFS curve appeared to reach a stable

plateau after 4 years of postremission treatment in adult
patients, and further ATO treatment after that time
would have no apparent clinical benefit (data not
shown); for this reason, the 4-year postremission therapy
regimen formed. The postremission therapy was somewhat intensified during the third year, because it had
been noticed that patients were often at high risks of
relapse during that time.
APL is difficult to study in the elderly because of its
rarity in this population. To our knowledge, only limited
studies of APL in elderly patients have been published.1,2,5,16,17 Although these various studies may lack
comparability due to differences in sample size, age distribution, severity of disease, medical conditions, and so
forth, the main results from these studies were still summarized in Table 5 to make a rough and easy comparison.
In 3 of the 6 series,1,2,5 selected patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were accrued, whereas unselected ones were
included in the other 3 studies. Similar response rates of
84% to 92% were found in all but 1 of the 6 study series.
In both the study in Spanish centers2 and ours, long-term
outcomes were encouraged, which is better than those in
the other 4 series. In addition, although reduced intensities of chemotherapy in older patients were used in 3 of
the 5 series,1,5,16 the mortality during postremission therapy remains high, up to 10% to 18.6%, and the main
cause of death was infection, whereas a high degree of
compliance of postremission therapy was observed in our
series, in which only 6.9% of patients died from noninfectious disease during postremission therapy. A similar
cumulative incidence of relapse was also found between
the Spanish study2 and the current study, which is comparable to that in the younger adult patients.1,2 All these
indicate a potential clinical significance of single-agent
ATO treatment for elderly APL patients.
Adverse effects of ATO treatment had been a big
concern. In this study, characterized by a low-dose
method, almost all patients experienced 1 or more adverse
events during remission induction; however, most side
effects were manageable, reversible, and were usually less
severe than those resulting from chemotherapy. No
patients died from the toxicities caused by ATO treatment. Concerns have been raised about the potentially
fatal cardiac and hepatic toxicity of ATO in a subset of
patients with APL. However, most of these toxicities have
been described in patients with relapsed APL who had
received multiple courses of chemotherapy, which were
often associated with cardiac and hepatic toxicities.18-20
In addition, the daily dose of ATO for these patients was
generally calculated on the basis of body weight without
124

maximum dosage limit, which was often too high for
patients who had excessive body weight,18-20 whereas this
was not the case in this series.
Another matter of great concern is whether longterm postremission therapy with ATO would result in
chronic arsenicosis or secondary malignancy. The present
study shows that although periodic ATO therapy continued for more than 4 years, no severe toxic effects or second
malignancies could be attributed to administration of
ATO even on long-term follow-up. Moreover, the analysis of arsenic retention from long-term survivors indicated
that no significant ATO accumulation was observed in
patients who had been off ATO therapy for more than
36 months. These results reinforce the long-term safety of
the regime.
The single-agent ATO regimen is particularly suitable for elderly APL patients who are not tolerant to conventional chemotherapy. First, the side effects of ATO are
mild and manageable. Even for elderly patients with antecedent cardiac, hepatic, and/or renal diseases, it also can
be applied with discretion under carefully monitored conditions, since there is no better alternative. Second, as a
result of the absence of myelosuppressive effects during
postremission therapy, ATO treatment can therefore not
only shorten the duration of hospitalization but also avoid
deaths from infection in HCR, therefore prolonging the
survival time of the elderly patients.
In conclusion, the data we show in this study demonstrate that the single-agent ATO regimen is highly
effective and safe treatment for elderly APL patients without either myelosuppression or significant risks to develop
chronic arsenicosis or secondary malignancy. Further
studies with multiple centers, larger sample sizes, and
complete cytogenetic and molecular data are highly
desired to improve and optimize the treatment for elderly
APL patients.
