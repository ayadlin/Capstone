Abstract
The antiangiogenic drug sunitinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant, yet not curative,
therapeutic effects in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Sunitinib is also an immunomodulator, potently
reversing myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and T-cell inhibition in the blood even of
nonresponder RCC patients. We observed that sunitinib similarly prevented MDSC accumulation and restored
normal T-cell function to the spleens of tumor-bearing mice, independent of the capacity of sunitinib to inhibit tumor progression (RENCA>CT26>4T1). Both monocytic and neutrophilic splenic MDSC were highly repressible by sunitinib. In contrast, MDSC within the microenvironment of 4T1 tumors or human RCC tumors
proved highly resistant to sunitinib and ambient T-cell function remained suppressed. Proteomic analyses
comparing tumor to peripheral compartments showed that granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) predicted sunitinib resistance and recombinant GM-CSF conferred sunitinib resistance to MDSC
in vivo and in vitro. MDSC conditioning with GM-CSF uniquely inhibited signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT3) and promoted STAT5 activation. STAT5ab(null/null) MDSC were rendered sensitive
to sunitinib in the presence of GM-CSF in vitro. We conclude that compartment-dependent GM-CSF exposure
in resistant tumors may account for the regionalized effect of sunitinib upon host MDSC modulation and
hypothesize that ancillary strategies to decrease such regionalized escape will enhance the potency of sunitinib
as an immunomodulator and a cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3526–36. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Angiogenesis is a crucial step in tumor progression and
hence the rational development of several angiogenesis inhibitors. One such drug, sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer), which inhibits signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor
1-3, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, ckit, flt3,
and m-CSF receptors, is typically first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC; refs. 1–3). Yet all patients
eventually progress on sunitinib, which is thought to reflect

an adaptive tumor resistance to angiogenesis inhibition
(4–6). Although the basis of such resistance is incompletely
understood, accumulating evidence suggests that host myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are recruited by tumors
to mediate resistance to antiangiogenic drugs (7, 8). Indeed,
MDSC themselves can promote angiogenesis (9–12), in addition to serving as pivotal agents of tumor-induced T2-type
biasing and the escape from cell-mediated immunity (13–15).
We recently showed that sunitinib therapy significantly
reversed RCC-induced MDSC accumulation in patients'
peripheral blood, correlating with improved peripheral T-cell
function (16). Sunitinib inhibited peripheral accumulation of
all currently identified CD33+ human-MDSC subsets, including immature (lineage negative), neutrophilic (CD15+CD14−),
and monocytic (CD14+HLADR−/dim) MDSC (16–23). Such pan
inhibition was unlikely to be mediated solely through an indirect antitumor effect because sunitinib therapy inhibited
peripheral MDSC accumulation even when RCC patients
displayed tumor progression (i.e., sunitinib treatment failure;
ref. 16). We therefore investigated whether the remarkable effect of sunitinib on peripheral MDSC was also evident when
animal tumors were treated with sunitinib and whether
sunitinib's seemingly decisive negative modulation of MDSC
extended into the tumor compartment.
We here report that sunitinib is uniformly effective
for suppressing peripheral (splenic) CD11b +Gr-1+ MDSC

accumulation in all tested tumor models, despite widely ranging antitumor effects among these models. Sunitinib inhibited
the proliferation of Ly6G− monocytic (m-) MDSC and also impaired the survival of Ly6G+ neutrophilic (n-) MDSC. We also
observed, however, that sunitinib's dramatic abrogation of
splenic MDSC and normalization of bystander T-cell function
did not extend to the tumor microenvironment in the most resistant 4T1 model or in human RCC. MDSC resistance to sunitinib corresponded to the compartmental availability of
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
and recombinant GM-CSF itself conferred sunitinib resistance
in vitro and in vivo. GM-CSF-induced sunitinib resistance in
MDSC was signal transducers and activators of transcription
5 (STAT5) mediated, as it was negated in STAT5ab(null/null)
MDSC, thus providing a likely rescue mechanism for MDSC in
the face of STAT3 inhibition by sunitinib (24). Such regional
disparities may explain how residual intratumoral MDSC contribute to antiangiogenic resistance despite pronounced drugmediated declines in peripheral MDSC.

Materials and Methods
Mice, tumors, and treatment. Experiments performed under institutionally approved animal research committee protocols adhered to U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines.
Female BALB/c mice from National Cancer Institute were
maintained pathogen free and studied at 8 to 12 weeks.
4T1-mammary, CT26-colonic, and RENCA-renal carcinomas
syngeniec to BALB/c mice were maintained and injected into
mice as previously described (25). Sunitinib 4, 20, or 40 mg/kg/
day i.p. was initiated for 9 days total after tumors reached 7 to
10 mm diameter. I.p. treatment yielded the same MDSC reductions as oral treatment. Spleens, bone marrow, and tumors
were processed as previously (25). STAT5ab(null/null) and
(wild-type, WT) bone marrow was obtained as previously (26).
Reagents. Culture medium consisted of RPMI 1640 + 10%
FCS and conventional additives (16, 27). Pan-T-cell isolation
kit and magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD11b, anti-FITC,
or anti-APC were from Miltenyi Biotec. Functional grade
anti–mouse-CD3ε and anti-CD28 were from BD Pharmingen.
rmflt3L, rmSCF, rmIL-6, rmG-CSF, and rmGM-CSF were from
Peprotech. Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
was from Invitrogen. Luminex Bioplex Mouse Cytokine
Arrays were from Bio-Rad. Proteome Profile Arrays were
from RnD Systems. Fluorochrome-coupled antibodies
were purchased from ebiosciences or BD Biosciences.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) data were collected on FACSCalibur (BD) and analyzed using the Cellquest
software (BD) or FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Determination of T-cell response. IFNγ production
was assayed following polyclonal stimulation as previously
described (16). Proliferation was assayed with either carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester dilutions or
tritiated thymidine incorporation as previously described
(25, 28).
In vivo proliferation and viability assays. One hour
following sunitinib treatment, mice were injected i.p. with
1 mg of sterile bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) mouse. Four hours

www.aacrjournals.org

following BrdU injection, cells obtained from spleen, bone
marrow, and, in some cases, tumor and blood were stained
according to the BrdU-APC kit (BD). Annexin V staining was
done as previously described (16).
MDSC subset isolation and staining. Splenic cell suspensions from 4T1+ mice were depleted of T-cells, B cells,
macrophages, and dendritic cells using allophycocyanin
(APC)-labeled antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, and MHCII and
anti-APC magnetic beads. Remaining cells contained mostly
MDSC and n-MDSC were isolated using anti–Ly6G-FITC and
anti-FITC beads. m-MDSC were isolated from the remaining
cells using anti-CD11b magnetic beads. LS magnetic columns
were from Miltenyi. Cells were then stained for FACS analysis
or were adhered to glass slides by cytospin. Adherent cells
were air dried then stained using Fisher Diagnostics Hema 3
Manual Staining kit, which is comparable with the WrightGiemsa method.
Cytokine analysis using proteome profile array. Equal
volumes of blood obtained through cardiac puncture were
added to EDTA to prevent clotting. Cell-free plasma obtained
following centrifugation at 4°C at 13,000 for 10 minutes was
stored at −80°C. Five hundred microliters of pooled plasma
was added to each membrane in the array. SuperSignal West
Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate from ThermoScientific was used for development. Additionally, lysates from
frozen tumor tissue were obtained using the provided lysis
buffer recipe with protease (ThermoScientific) and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce) added. Protein was assayed using
the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit as per the manual. One
hundred fifty micrograms of protein were added to each
membrane.
Cytokine analysis using Bioplex array. Pooled plasma
obtained as above. Spleen and tumor tissue was immediately
frozen in Eppendorf tubes on dry ice. Lysates were obtained
from thawed, homogenized/sonicated tissue in the same lysis
buffer as above and protein quantified as above. Plasma
was assayed according to the Bio-Plex Pro custom assay
(Bio-Rad). Tissue lysates were brought to 1 mg/mL using
1 × PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 50 μL were
added to each well. A separate standard curve was made
using lysis buffer as diluent for the analysis of cell lysates.
Data were acquired and analyzed on a Luminex device using
the Bio-Rad Bio-Plex System and Bio-Plex Manager software.
pSTAT signaling analysis in MDSC. Bone marrow–derived
MDSC were cultured in stem cell factor (SCF) + flt3L +/− either interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or GM-CSF. pStat staining was done according to
the BD Phosflow Fix Buffer I and Perm Buffer III products.
Briefly, culture plates were spun down and supernatants were
removed. Fix buffer I was added to wells for 10 minutes at 37°C.
Washed cells were surface stained (CD11b and Gr1), fixed/permeabilized with ice-cold Perm Buffer III for 30 minutes on ice,
then Fc blocked with 10% heat-inactivated rat serum, rat IgG,
and anti-CD16/32 antibodies before staining. Anti-pStat antibodies and isotypes were Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated.
Analysis of human RCC tumor tissue. Freshly explanted
clear cell RCC tumors were digested. Cells were stained for
MDSC or cultured at 1 million lymphocytes/mL in complete

RPMI and stimulated for IFNγ production as above. Some
tumors (RCC- 0885, 0803, 0958, and 3081427) were cultured
short term (one to two passages) and GM-CSF was quantified
in resultant cell-free supernatants or in supernatants derived
from the long-term clear cell RCC line, SK-RC26b, (previously
acquired from Dr. Neil Bander, Weill Medical College of
Cornell University, New York, NY; ref. 29) in the presence
or absence of sunitinib.
Biostatistics. Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments
were completed at least thrice, with at least five mice per
group. Results were pooled and the mean ± SD were expressed graphically as columns. Treatment groups were compared using t test for two samples assuming equal variances.
A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was deemed significant.

Results
Sunitinib reverses systemic MDSC-mediated immune
suppression in mice bearing renal and nonrenal tumors.
We first studied the ability of sunitinib to act as a broad immunopotentiator in several mouse tumor models. Treatment
of either Renca-kidney–, CT26-colon–, or 4T1-breast tumor–
bearing mice with sunitinib (40 mg/kg) daily for 9 days significantly reduced both the percentage and total numbers of
CD11b+Gr1+ MDSC detected in the spleen. Significant MDSC
reductions also occurred in Renca+ or CT26+ with 20 mg/kg
sunitinib (Fig. 1A). MDSC reductions were associated with
significant disinhibition of T cells that were otherwise
suppressed in the tumor-bearing state. T cells from tumorbearing mice were less able to produce IFNγ in response
to polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3/28 when compared
with naïve, nontumor-bearing mice. Such T-cell suppression
was reversible with either in vivo MDSC depletion using sunitinib, or in vitro MDSC depletion using anti–Gr-1 magnetic
beads; finally, bead-isolated MDSC could be introduced to
suppress T cells from naïve mice as well (Fig. 1B). Deficits
in T-cell proliferation were also attributable to the presence
of MDSC (Fig. 1C), and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells regained function when MDSC were depleted with sunitinib or mechanically
(Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that MDSC are major mediators of T-cell suppression in tumor-bearing hosts and that suppressed T cells can be rendered functional if activated in the
absence of MDSC. In addition, higher doses of sunitinib were
required in 4T1+ mice to fully reverse immune suppression.
Sunitinib inhibits the intrasplenic proliferation of
m-MDSC. We next asked whether sunitinib functions to inhibit MDSC expansion in vivo. The proliferative rate of MDSC
was kinetically quantified by the percentage of BrdUrd+ cells.
Within the MDSC population, cells brightest for Gr1 staining
(Gr1hi) were relatively nonproliferative in naïve and tumorbearing mice (pink squares, <10%BrdUrd+; green squares
and triangles, 10–20%BrdUrd+ , respectively; Fig. 2A, left
(spleen) and right (bone marrow). In contrast, MDSC, which
were dim for Gr1 (Gr1 lo ), were very proliferative in the
spleens and bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice (blue
squares and triangles; Fig. 2A, left and right, ∼50%BrdUrd+)
compared with naïve mice, in which proliferation was only
present in the bone marrow but not in spleen (red circles,

<10%BrdUrd+; Fig. 2A, left; P < 0.0002 compared with tumor
bearing), indicating the pronounced proliferative pathology
of splenic Gr1lo MDSC in the tumor-bearing state. Sunitinib
reversed this pathology by significantly inhibiting the expansion of splenic Gr1lo MDSC on day 6 following treatment
(blue triangles; P < 0.02; Fig. 2A). The analysis undertaken
is shown in Fig. 2B. Sunitinib did not have a sustained effect
on bone marrow MDSC proliferation, which was reflected in
sunitinib's (40 mg/kg) lack of effect on the %MDSC in naïve
or tumor-positive mouse bone marrow (data not shown).
These findings suggested that MDSC could be functionally
divided into two groups based on their proliferative potential
in vivo. Upon isolation, as previously reported (30, 31), Ly6G+
n-MDSC were indeed Gr1hi, Ly6G+, and F4/80−, and displayed
early or completed polymorphonuclear features on cytospins
(Fig. 2C), consistent with their lower rate of proliferation.
Ly6G− m-MDSC were Gr1lo, Ly6G−, and evenly distributed
with regard to F4/80 expression and monocytic versus immature morphology in cytospins (Fig. 2C), consistent with their
higher rate of proliferation. Thus, splenic m-MDSC were
highly proliferative compared with n-MDSC and sunitinib inhibited this proliferation, significantly contributing to the
overall reduction in splenic MDSC accumulation.
Sunitinib impairs the viability of splenic n-MDSC. We
found over half the Gr1hi n-MDSC in the spleens of naïve
mice were undergoing apoptosis, consistent with their being
normal neutrophils with a rapid rate of turnover in naïve
animals (Fig. 2D). The rate of n-MDSC apoptosis in tumorbearing mice was significantly reduced compared with naïve
mice, indicating that they have a prolonged life span in vivo.
Sunitinib significantly reduced the viability of splenic
n-MDSC in vivo on day 6 following treatment (P < 0.00005;
Fig. 2D). In contrast, m-MDSC generally had lower rates of
apoptosis that were only modestly affected by sunitinib in vivo
(naïve, 25%; 4T1, 15%; 4T1+sunitinib, 32% on average; data
not shown).
Compared with spleen, intratumoral MDSC are sunitinib
resistant in resistant tumor models. In contrast to the global effect of sunitinib to improve splenic T-cell function
through reductions in MDSC, the drug's effect on tumor
growth varied considerably. Renca kidney tumors were disproportionately sensitive to sunitinib, with tumor shrinkage
occurring at both 20 and 40 mg/kg drug. In contrast, CT26
tumors continued to progress, albeit more slowly, during sunitinib treatment, and 4T1 tumor growth was not significantly affected by sunitinib treatment (Fig. 3A). Tumor cell
sensitivity to drug in vitro was inversely related to in vivo sensitivity. As such, the variable effects of sunitinib on tumor
growth in vivo could not be predicted by its variable toxicity
to tumor cells lines in vitro (Fig. 3B).
We then examined the effect of sunitinib on cellular tumor
constituents that remained following a 4 mg/kg (Renca
tumors only), 20, or 40 mg/kg daily treatment schedule.
Unlike Renca and CT26 tumors, 4T1 tumors retained statistically equal amounts of MDSC following treatment at
20 mg/kg, and compared with splenic MDSC in 4T1+
mice, there was a much more modest decline in tumorassociated MDSC (Fig. 3C) in response to 40 mg/kg drug.

In vivo Mechanism of MDSC Suppression by Sunitinib

Figure 1. Sunitinib reverses immune suppression in tumor-bearing hosts. A, mice were given 4T1, CT26, or Renca tumors (s.c.) and sunitinib (sut)
initiated for 9 days. MDSC analyzed by FACS at the end of treatment. B, splenocytes from naïve, nontreated, or sunitinib-treated tumor-bearing mice,
or from 4T1+ mice depleted for MDSC (magnetic beads), or from naïve mice with isolated MDSC added in, were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 and IFNγ
detected after 72 hours by FACS intracellular staining. C, proliferation induced specifically in response to CD3/28 stimulation in each of the above conditions
is shown. D, representative data from two experiments showing carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester dilutions in CD4 and CD8-gated splenocytes.

In this relatively resistant model, tumor-infiltrating T cells
from sunitinib-treated mice did not function significantly
better than those from nontreated mice, in marked contrast
to the improved splenic T-cell function obtainable from the
same mice (Fig. 3D, left). Indeed, intratumoral MDSC from
sunitinib-treated 4T1+ mice retained T cell–suppressive capabilities equivalent to those from nontreated mice (Fig. 3D,
right). Our findings suggest that even when sunitinib broadly
reverses peripheral MDSC accumulation (16), intratumoral
MDSC can be significantly less affected.

GM-CSF is selectively expressed in resistant tumor
microenvironment in vivo and uniquely protects MDSC
in the presence of sunitinib in vitro. Despite their disparate susceptibilities to in vivo sunitinib exposure, purified
splenic- and tumor-derived MDSC proved equally sensitive
to sunitinib-mediated apoptosis in culture (data not shown),
prompting us to investigate regionally produced factors that
could account for in vivo disparities. To determine whether
the presence of a particular cytokine or group of cytokines
could predict intratumoral sunitinib resistance, we used

sunitinib treatment. B, Renca, CT26, and 4T1 tumor cells were seeded and allowed to adhere overnight. Sunitinib was added to cultures at various
doses the following morning for 72 hours. At the end of treatment, the recovery of adherent cells (cells counted following trypsonization of washed cells) was
counted, as well as the viability of all cells (adherent and nonadherent combined) determined with Annexin V and 7AAD FACS staining. C, MDSC were
measured as a percentage of viable, scatter-gated cells in tumors digested following the various doses of sunitinib treatment in each tumor model.

T cells was assayed and compared with that produced by T cells from naïve spleen suspensions. Right, MDSC from nontreated 4T1+ spleens or from

in the plasma and tumor lysates of mice bearing Renca,
CT26, or 4T1 tumors. 4T1+ mice contained an abundance
of systemic and intratumoral G-CSF compared with mice
bearing other tumor types (Fig. 4A). In addition, GM-CSF
was selectively present in the tumor bed of 4T1+ mice

of nontreated and sunitinib-treated 4T1+ mice confirmed

nontreated and sunitinib-treated mice (Fig. 4B). The need
to flush and disaggregate bone marrow did not permit its direct comparison with the other tissues.
Because several host- and tumor-produced factors such
as SCF, IL-6, G-CSF, and GM-CSF have been implicated in
MDSC accumulation (32), we cultured fresh bone marrow
containing MDSC in the presence of SCF and flt3 ligand
to provide basal support, with the further addition of either
IL-6, G-CSF, or GM-CSF +/− sunitinib. Sunitinib significantly
impaired the viability of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSC, but GM-CSF,
and to a lesser extent G-CSF, could partially restore MDSC

viability when added to cultures (Fig. 4C). Indeed, 10 ng/mL
of GM-CSF protected MDSC significantly better than G-CSF
added at 100 ng/mL. In addition, G-CSF and GM-CSF, when
added to SCF and Flt3L, induced the strongest proliferative
response in these cultures, and although sunitinib totally
prevented MDSC expansion in the presence of G-CSF, it
had a relatively modest effect in the presence of GM-CSF
(Fig. 4D).
GM-CSF confers sunitinib-resistance to peripheral
MDSC and relies on STAT5 signaling to rescue MDSC from
sunitinib toxicity. 4T1+ mice received systemic GM-CSF
(i.p.) with and without sunitinib treatments to test whether
systemic resistance to sunitinib would result. Indeed, daily
GM-CSF significantly inhibited the remarkable reductions
in splenic MDSC otherwise seen in response to sunitinib in
4T1+ mice (Fig. 5A). The persistence of 30% MDSC in GMCSF–treated mice was sufficient to significantly inhibit the
recovery in T-cell function that was otherwise induced in
sunitinib-treated 4T1+ mice (Fig. 5B).
To test whether a particular signaling profile could distinguish sunitinib-sensitive from sunitinib-insensitive MDSC, we
performed intracellular staining for steady-state levels of
pY705STAT3 and pY694STAT5 expression in MDSC cultured
in nonprotective (SCF, Flt3L, ± IL-6, or G-CSF) or protective
(SCF, Flt3L, + GM-CSF) conditions. Consistent with our pre-

vious studies (24), MDSC maintained in the absence of GMCSF displayed a STAT3-driven signaling signature (Fig. 5C);
and, consistent with prior reports, these STAT3-driven MDSC
showed sensitivity to sunitinib, resulting in pSTAT3 downregulation (25). In contrast, GM-CSF dominantly activated
pSTAT5 (Fig. 5C) rather than pSTAT3, suggesting that STAT5
could provide an alternate survival signal for MDSC in the
presence of sunitinib-mediated pSTAT3 inhibition in MDSC.
This was formally tested by comparing sunitinib sensitivity in
the presence of GM-CSF in WT versus STAT5ab(null/null)
MDSC. We found that the absence of STAT5 rendered MDSC
sensitive to sunitinib-mediated toxicity in the presence of
GM-CSF, whereas having no significant effect on cultures
driven by pSTAT3-promoting IL-6 and/or G-CSF (Fig. 5D).
Tumor microenvironment limits the anti-MDSC
effect of sunitinib in RCC patients. We next quantified
MDSC subsets in RCC patients' tumor specimens (described
in Supplementary Table S1) using the gating methods
shown for HLADR−CD33hiCD15−CD14+ monocytic, HLADR−
CD33 h i CD15 − CD14 − lineage–negative, and HLADR −
CD33loCD15+CD14− neutrophilic MDSC. Figure 6A shows
the average percentage of each MDSC subset detected in
tumors from nontreated patients, as well as the amount
detected in two tumors from sunitinib-treated patients.

In vivo Mechanism of MDSC Suppression by Sunitinib

observed in RCC patients treated with sunitinib (16), tumors
obtained from sunitinib-treated patients have not shown
declines in MDSC. The continued presence of MDSC in the
tumors of sunitinib-treated patients was associated with
continued T-cell suppression, as measured by IFNγ production, compared with normal donor T cells and T cells from
nontreated tumors (Fig. 6B). In addition, several short-term
tumor cell lines derived from surgical patients' RCC tumors
(one to two passages) produced abundant GM-CSF in vitro
and this production was not significantly reduced in the
presence of sunitinib (Fig. 6C). GM-CSF levels equivalent to
those detected in RCC supernatants could also induce
pSTAT5 activation in patient-derived MDSC (Fig. 6D). This
suggests that compartmental constraints limit the ability of
sunitinib to act as an immunopotentiator and that locally
produced GM-CSF may promote local sunitinib resistance.

Discussion
Although the role of immunosurveillance to inhibit tumor
progression is well documented, there are many obstacles
that prevent the destruction of advanced tumors by immune

cells, one of which is MDSC accumulation. Sunitinib targets
several RTKs and has experienced relative clinical success,
especially in the setting of mRCC (1). We recently reported
the ability of sunitinib to reverse immune suppression
in mRCC patients through MDSC inhibition (16), yet the
broad potential of sunitinib to modulate immune function
independently of its antitumor effect was unknown. We here
report that sunitinib, when used at clinically relevant doses
(33, 34), can inhibit MDSC accumulation, and thereby restore
normal T-cell function, in the spleens of mice bearing both
sunitinib-sensitive and sunitinib-insensitive tumors. This
suggests that the immunomodulatory activities of sunitinib
occur independently of its antitumor potency. As such, sunitinib may prove as a useful adjunct agent in immunotherapy
trials (35).
We here show two mechanisms by which sunitinib inhibits
MDSC accumulation. Pilot studies identified the spleen and
bone marrow as sites of MDSC proliferation, with BrdUrdpositive cells appearing after only a 1-hour BrdUrd pulse.
Using in vivo BrdUrd administration, Gr1lo m-MDSC were
found to proliferate rapidly in the bone marrow of naïve
and tumor-bearing mice, and in the spleens of tumor-bearing

mice, suggesting that the extramedullary proliferation is the
most pathologic proliferation because it does not normally
occur in naïve mice under steady-state conditions. Sunitinib
had an antiproliferative effect on splenic m-MDSC in vivo and
this effect could be duplicated in vitro.
The antiproliferative effect of sunitinib is unlikely to
account solely for the remarkable declines seen in MDSC
in response to drug. Because previous studies had shown
sunitinib to have a toxic effect on RCC patient MDSC in vitro
(16), its effect on Gr1hi, neutrophilic MDSC (n-MDSC) viability was also studied in vivo. Our findings show that Gr1hi
n-MDSC were relatively nonproliferative and suggest that
the accumulation of this MDSC subset in tumor-bearing mice
is more related to an abnormally prolonged life span. Indeed,

n-MDSC from tumor-bearing mice were much less likely to be
undergoing apoptosis at any given time, compared with naïve
mice. Sunitinib seemed to normalize this in vivo by increasing
the frequency of n-MDSC apoptosis, as measured by Annexin
V staining, an effect that was reproducible in vitro. The data
thus show that sunitinib acts to inhibit both the abnormal
expansion of m-MDSC and the abnormally extended survival
of n-MDSC. An alternative interpretation is that sunitinib
prevents the expansion of mononuclear MDSC, which may,
in part, represent n-MDSC precursors (36). Such activity
alone could lead to the perceived increase in n-MDSC apoptosis because terminal n-MDSC would eventually undergo
spontaneous apoptosis and fail to be replaced. This possibility
is currently being tested.

In vivo Mechanism of MDSC Suppression by Sunitinib

In addition to being MDSC subset specific, our data
strongly suggest that sunitinib's inhibition of MDSC is direct.
Proteome profile and luminex arrays did not identify a decline in any of the factors implicated in MDSC expansion
or activation. In fact, several cytokines such as G-CSF and
IFNγ were present at increased amounts in sunitinib-treated
mice, consistent with the parallel observations of Ebos and
colleagues (37) in naïve mice.
The receptors involved in the anti-MDSC activity of sunitinib are currently under investigation. Putative RTKs inhibited by sunitinib include targets of VEGF, SCF (ckit), Flt3L
(flt3), m-CSF, and PDGF (1–3). SCF has recently been implicated in MDSC accumulation (38) and sunitinib inhibits its
receptor, ckit. However, culture with RTK ligands such as
SCF and/or flt3L produced only limited MDSC expansion
and viability unless combined with proliferatively synergizing
cytokines such as IL-6, G-CSF, or GM-CSF (25). This suggests
that although the sunitinib RTK targets ckit and/or flt3 may
provide permissive signals for MDSC expansion, tumorpromoted excessive MDSC accumulation requires synergy
from additional cytokines.
G-CSF and GM-CSF have both previously been implicated
in MDSC expansion (21, 32, 39, 40) and vaccines that produce
higher concentrations of GM-CSF have been reported to be
less effective as a consequence of promoting MDSC (39).
Additionally, however, our studies show the divergent abilities of G-CSF and GM-CSF to confer resistance to sunitinib
in vitro and in vivo, paralleling the compartmental disparities
of these cytokines in vivo. Because the Renca model is
paradoxically far more vulnerable to sunitinib treatment
than human RCC, we believe other models such as 4T1 are
potentially more predictive of escape mechanisms relevant to
human cancer. Notably, both mouse 4T1 and human RCCs
displayed disparately greater GM-CSF production than
sunitinib-sensitive peripheral compartments (plasma),
whereas all compartments were similarly rich in G-CSF.
We hypothesize that the striking ability of GM-CSF but not
other pro-proliferative cytokines to promote sunitinib resistance is due to its preferential activation of STAT5, which
cannot be appreciably repressed by sunitinib. Our previous
studies showed that treatment of CD34+ hematopoieitic
progenitors with GM-CSF induced proliferative synergy with
Flt3L/IL-6 despite GM-CSF-mediated inhibition of STAT3
activation in favor of dominant STAT5 programming (25).
Despite preventing STAT3 activation, GM-CSF continued to
display proliferative synergy with Flt3L and IL-6, which was
undiminished even for STAT3 knockout bone marrow (25).
We here show a similar pSTAT5-dominated signaling path-

way for MDSC exposed to GM-CSF. Conversely, in the absence of GM-CSF, combinations of SCF, Flt3L, IL-6, and/or
G-CSF all promoted STAT3-activated MDSC that were highly
susceptible to inhibition by sunitinib. Although previous
studies have highlighted the importance of STAT3 signaling
in MDSC accumulation and function (41, 42), as well as in
emergency granulopoiesis (43), the present report is the first
to show the generation of MDSC in a steady state of STAT5
rather than STAT3 activation, the consequence of GM-CSF
exposure. Because sunitinib was recently shown to inhibit
MDSC expression of STAT3 (24), we hypothesize that GMCSF, when available, can rescue MDSC by reprogramming
them to function independently of STAT3, rendering them
resistant to sunitinib. Indeed, in vitro experiments with
STAT5ab(null/null) mice furthermore confirmed an important role for STAT5 in MDSC rescue from sunitinib-toxicity.
MDSC-mediated diminutions in T cell–mediated immunity may contribute to the currently limited effectiveness of immunotherapy in RCC and other tumors (16, 44–47). Our
previous studies in RCC patients showed that MDSC declines
and improvements in T-cell function were not contingent
upon tumor shrinkage in response to sunitinib and even
sunitinib-induced tumor cytoreduction is not associated with
cure (16, 47). Our data thus far obtained in human RCC patients support the model established in 4T1 tumor–bearing
mice, in which peripheral compartment reductions in MDSC
ubiquitously occur in response to sunitinib, but in which the
anti-MDSC activity of the drug is much less pronounced intratumorally as a result of a relative abundance of nonsunitinib-targeted growth factors, such as GM-CSF, which
provide alternative sunitinib-resistant survival signals. We
are investigating ancillary strategies to abrogate such regional resistance, to enhance the potency of sunitinib both as an
immunomodulator and as a cancer therapy.
