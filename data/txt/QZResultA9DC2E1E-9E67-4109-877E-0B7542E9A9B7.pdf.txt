Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a predominantly p53 wild-type (wt) tumour and MDM2-p53
antagonists offer a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma patients. RG7388
(Roche) is currently undergoing early phase clinical evaluation in adults. This
study assessed the efficacy of RG7388 as a single-agent and in combination with
chemotherapies currently used to treat neuroblastoma in a panel of neuroblastoma
cell lines. RG7388 GI50 concentrations were determined in 21 p53-wt and mutant
neuroblastoma cell lines of varying MYCN, MDM2 and p14ARF status, together with
MYCN-regulatable Tet21N cells. The primary determinant of response was the presence
of wt p53, and overall there was a >200-fold difference in RG7388 GI50 concentrations
for p53-wt versus mutant cell lines. Tet21N MYCN+ cells were significantly more
sensitive to RG7388 compared with MYCN- cells. Using median-effect analysis in 5
p53-wt neuroblastoma cell lines, selected combinations of RG7388 with cisplatin,
doxorubicin, topotecan, temozolomide and busulfan were synergistic. Furthermore,
combination treatments led to increased apoptosis, as evident by higher caspase-3/7
activity compared to either agent alone. These data show that RG7388 is highly potent
against p53-wt neuroblastoma cells, and strongly supports its further evaluation as
a novel therapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma and wt p53 to potentially
improve survival and/or reduce toxicity.

Introduction

The importance of p53 in human cancer is emphasised
by observations that p53 is mutated in up to half of all
malignancies, whilst aberrant upstream or downstream
p53 pathways, including MDM2 amplification and p14ARF
inactivation are common events in p53 wild-type (wt)
cancers [2].
MDM2-p53 binding antagonists are a novel class
of anti-cancer therapeutics currently in early clinical
development, which act by disrupting the interaction
between p53 and MDM2 to non-genotoxically activate
wt p53. Hoffmann-La Roche were the first to report
potent and selective small molecule MDM2-p53 binding
antagonists, the cis-imidazoline (Nutlin) compound series
[3]. To date, Nutlin-3 has been shown to stabilise p53
and activate the p53 pathway, inducing cell cycle arrest,

The p53 protein plays a central role in tumour
suppression, by regulating the expression of numerous
downstream target genes involved in cellular processes
such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, differentiation and
senescence. Under normal cellular conditions, p53 is
maintained at low levels due a tightly regulated negative
feedback loop involving the critical negative regulator,
MDM2. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, induced in
response to p53 activation to directly bind p53 and
inhibit its transcriptional activity, as well as promote the
nuclear export and targeting of p53 for ubiquitin mediated
proteasome degradation. p14ARF is a tumour suppressor
and a negative regulator of MDM2 (reviewed by [1]).

apoptosis, differentiation and/or senescence, in several p53
wt pre-clinical cancer models. The lead cis-imidazoline,
RG7112, was subsequently the first of its class to
enter clinical trials and despite demonstrating proofof-mechanism in adult MDM2-amplified liposarcoma
patients [4], results from several Phase I trials indicated
highly variable bioavailability, a poor tolerability to daily
oral administration and thrombocytopenia as a doselimiting toxicity [5]. Subsequently, RG7388, a pyrrolidine
and second generation MDM2-p53 antagonist from
Hoffman-La Roche with enhanced potency, selectivity and
bioavailability, and available in both oral and intravenous
(IV) formulations has been developed [6]. To overcome
tolerability issues with daily administration, intermittent
schedules of RG7388, which may enable the bone
marrow to recover have advanced to clinical evaluation
in adults alone and in combination (www.clinicaltrials.
gov; NCT01462175; NCT01773408; NCT02098967) [7,
8]. RG7388 is anticipated to enter paediatric early phase
trials in the near future.
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal malignancy of
the developing neural crest accounting for 8-10% of
all paediatric cancers but 15% of childhood cancer
mortality [9]. Over 50% of patients present with highrisk metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Despite
an initial response to intensive multimodal therapy,
relapse with chemoresistant disease is common and can
rarely be salvaged. MYCN gene amplification, found in
50% of high-risk patients, is associated with rapid tumour
progression and a poor prognosis (reviewed by [10]). The
overall long-term survival of high-risk patients currently
remains less than 50%, with survivors often having
long-term toxicities as a consequence of the intensive
chemotherapy. Thus there is a continuing need to identify
novel and less toxic therapies to improve survival of this
subset of patients.
In neuroblastoma p53 mutations are rare, even at
relapse (< 15%), and inactivation of the p53/MDM2/p14ARF
pathway in relapsed neuroblastoma is predominantly due
to lesions upstream of p53, such as MDM2 amplification
and p14ARF aberrations [11]. Non-genotoxic activation
of wt p53 using MDM2-p53 antagonists offers a novel
therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma treatment.
Acquisition of resistance through de novo mutations
following continuous exposure to Nutlin-3 have however
been reported in vitro, and may limit the usefulness of
MDM2-p53 antagonists as single-agent therapy [12]. This
provides a rationale for using MDM2-p53 antagonists to
improve the therapeutic index of current chemotherapy
regimens, to enhance tumour killing without increasing
toxicity whilst minimising the development of resistance.
Studies to date have demonstrated the efficacy of Nutlin-3
in pre-clinical neuroblastoma models alone and in
combination with cisplatin, camptothecin and bleomycin,
and with targeted agents including bevacizumab and
seliciclib (reviewed by [13]). However, the pre-clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

efficacy of the most advanced clinical candidate, RG7388,
has yet to be evaluated in paediatric cancers, including
neuroblastoma.
Using a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines, this study
assessed the efficacy of RG7388 as a single agent, and in
combination with chemotherapies routinely used to treat
neuroblastoma, namely, cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan,
temozolomide and busulfan. The overall aim was to
provide pre-clinical data to support the clinical evaluation
of RG7388 alone and/or in combination with conventional
chemotherapy in patients with neuroblastoma to improve
outcome and reduce toxicity.

Results
RG7388 is highly potent in p53 wt neuroblastoma
cell lines
The concentration of RG7388 required to inhibit
growth by 50% (GI50) was determined using XTT cell
proliferation assays in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines,
including 5 p53 mutant and 16 p53 wt cell lines of varying
MYCN, MDM2 and p14ARF status, together with the p53 wt
MYCN-regulatable SHEP Tet21N cells (Table 1, Figure
1A, Supplementary Figure 1A). The panel included
2 isogenic paired p53 wt and mutant cell lines, IMR32
and IMR/KAT100, and NGP, N_N20R1 and N_M5R1.
p53 wt, MDM2 amplified human osteosarcoma SJSA-1
cells, previously shown to be sensitive to RG7388 and
extensively used in the pre-clinical evaluation of several
classes of MDM2-p53 antagonists to date, were used as a
positive control [6, 8, 14-17] (Table 1). Consistent with the
mechanism of action of MDM2-p53 antagonists, p53 wt
neuroblastoma cell lines were significantly more sensitive
to RG7388 compared to p53 mutant cell lines (P < 0.0001,
Mann-Whitney test). Overall, all 16 neuroblastoma cell
lines with wt p53 had nanomolar range GI50 values
(range 14.8-140.3 nM; 68.2 (mean) ± 43.3 (SD) nM) of
comparable sensitivity to SJSA-1 cells. In contrast, all 5
p53 mutant cell lines had GI50 values greater than 10 µM
(range 10.1-16.9 µM; 14.6 (mean) ± 2.7 (SD) µM) (Table
1 and Figure 1A), representing > 200-fold differential
between the average GI50 concentrations of p53 wt versus
p53 mutant cell lines. Comparisons of GI50 concentrations
between paired isogenic p53 wt and mutant neuroblastoma
cell lines, demonstrated a 252-fold differential between
IMR32 and IMR/KAT100, and a 406-fold and 384-fold
differential between NGP and N_N20R1, and NGP and
N_M5R1, respectively.

oxindole) (P < 0.05, paired t test), compared with Tet21N
MYCN- cells (Figure 1B). Sensitivity of the present panel
of neuroblastoma cell lines to RG7388 was analysed in
relation to their MYCN, p14ARF and MDM2 status (Table
1 and Supplementary Figure 1B-E). The present panel
included 8 MYCN amplified and 8 non-MYCN amplified
p53 wt neuroblastoma cell lines (Table 1), and there was
a non-significant trend for MYCN amplified cell lines to
be more sensitive to RG7388 (P = 0.087, Welch t test,
Supplementary Figure 1B).
Four out of 16 of the panel had p14ARF aberrations
and 4/16 had non-syntenic amplification of MDM2 and
MYCN (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A). Of note,
p14ARF and MDM2 abnormalities were mutually exclusive.
There was a non-significant trend for p14ARF aberrant cell
lines to be more resistant to RG7388 (P = 0.187, Welch
t test, Supplementary Figure 1C). Similarly, there was a
non-significant trend for MDM2/MYCN co-amplified cell
lines to be more sensitive to RG7388 versus cell lines
which were not MDM2/MYCN co-amplified (P = 0.074,
Welch t test, Supplementary Figure 1D). No difference in
sensitivity to RG7388 was found between MDM2/MYCN
co-amplified versus MYCN amplified (P = 0.797, Welch t
test, Supplementary Figure 1E).

From the original panel of cell lines assessed above,
8 p53 wt neuroblastoma cell lines (non-MYCN amplified
SHSY5Y & SKNRA; MYCN amplified IMR32 & LAN5;
MDM2 and MYCN co-amplified NGP & NB1691;
p14ARF methylated Per-108 & GIMEN) and Tet21N
cells were analysed for cell cycle phase distribution and
induction of apoptosis in response to RG7388 (Figure 2
and Supplementary Table 1). Cells were treated for 24
hours with 1×, 10×, 50× and 100× their respective GI50
concentrations of RG7388 (Table 1) and analysed using
flow cytometry. An increase in the percentage of sub-G1
events, as a surrogate marker of apoptosis, was observed
in all cell lines in response to one or more concentrations
of RG7388. Overall, the accumulation of events in sub-G1
phase occurred in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1). The G1:S ratio
was calculated as an indicator of G1 cell cycle arrest, and
with the exception of MYCN amplified LAN5 and IMR32
cells, all other cell lines including Tet21N cells in the
presence and absence of MYCN, demonstrated at least a
2-fold increase in G1:S ratio in response to treatment with
at least one or more concentrations of RG7388 (Figure
2B and Supplementary Table 1). In line with the role of
MYCN in driving proliferation, switching off MYCN in
the Tet21N system led to an increase in baseline G1:S ratio
(MYCN+, 4.2 ± 0.8 versus MYCN-, 17.6 ± 5.3) (Figure
2B and Supplementary Table 1). Finally, treatment with ≥
10× GI50 concentrations of RG7388 led to an accumulation
of cells in G2/M phase in NGP, NB1691 and GIMEN cells
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1).
RG7388 induced apoptosis was also assessed by
Caspase 3/7 assays in the 8 cell lines following treatment
for 24 hours with 1× and 10× their respective RG7388 GI50
concentrations (Figure 2C). With the exception of SKNRA
and Tet21N cells, all remaining p53 wt neuroblastoma
cell lines exhibited a concentration-dependent increase
in caspase 3/7 activity in response to RG7388 (Figure
2C). In Tet21N cells, MYCN+ cells had consistently
higher caspase 3/7 activity compared with MYCN- cells
(data not shown). In the majority of cell lines, increases
in caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 2C) were consistent
with the accumulation of sub-G1 events (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Table 1), although caspase 3/7 activity is a
more sensitive and specific indicator of apoptosis.

Functional activation of the p53 pathway in p53
wt neuroblastoma cell lines in response to RG7388
treatment
In the same panel of 21 neuroblastoma cell lines
and the Tet21N system, functional activation of the
p53 pathway in response to treatment for 6 hours with
RG7388 at 1× and 10× their respective GI50 concentrations
(Table 1) were assessed by Western blotting (Figure 1C).
Stabilisation of p53, and induction of p53 targets, MDM2,
p21WAF1 and PUMA were observed in all 16 p53 wt cell
lines and Tet21N MYCN+ and MYCN- cells (Figure
1C), and in some cases this occurred in a concentrationdependent manner. Tet21N MYCN+ cells had higher basal
p53 levels, as previously reported [20], and in response
to RG7388 treatment exhibited higher levels of p53
stabilisation and had higher levels of MDM2 and PUMA
compared with Tet21N MYCN- cells (Figure 1C). As
expected, no induction of p53 or p53 targets was observed
in p53 mutant neuroblastoma cell lines. All p53 mutant
cell lines demonstrated a decrease in p53 expression
in response to treatment with 10× their respective
GI50 concentrations of RG7388, which is most likely
attributable to the very high concentrations of RG7388
affecting cell viability due to off-target effects (Figure 1C).

RG7388 synergises with chemotherapies currently
used to treat neuroblastoma
The current treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma
involves combinations of different chemotherapies,
including cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan, temozolomide

expression were the most sensitive to temozolomide
(Supplementary Figure 1A). NB1691 cells were the most
resistant to both temozolomide and busulfan.
For combination studies, cells were treated for
72 hours with RG7388 and chemotherapies alone, and
in combination at 5 equipotent concentrations between
0.125× and 4× their respective GI50 concentrations
depending on the cell line and chemotherapy agent (Table
1 and 2). At least one or more of the in vitro RG7388
and chemotherapy concentrations tested were within
previously observed clinically achievable peak plasma
drug concentrations. Combination treatment in all cases
led to greater growth inhibition compared to either
treatment alone (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figures 2
& 3). The data were then analysed to determine whether
the observed greater growth inhibition was additive or
synergistic using median-effect analysis, which enables
the quantitative evaluation of drug interactions based on
the CI value. CI values were computed for each constant
ratio combination and at estimated effect levels of ED50,
ED75 and ED90 (Table 2 and Figure 3B & C). Overall,
across all cell lines and chemotherapies, CI values varied
with the effect level, therefore the average of CI values
at ED50, ED75 and ED90 was also determined (Table 2 and
Figure 3C). The majority of RG7388 and chemotherapy
combinations at the GI50 concentrations ranged from
slightly synergistic to synergistic (Figure 3B). The latter
was also true when the average CI values at ED50, ED75
and ED90 was used to evaluate the interaction (Figure
3C). Taken together, cisplatin demonstrated the least
degree of synergy with RG7388, whilst the remaining
chemotherapies demonstrated comparable synergy with
RG7388 (Table 2 and Figure 3B & C). With the exception
of cisplatin, the most synergistic interactions between
RG7388 and chemotherapy were observed in p53 wt,
MDM2 and MYCN co-amplified NGP cells (Table 2 and
Figure 3). This observation did not however extend to two
additional MDM2 and MYCN co-amplified cell lines, LS
and NB1691 (Table 2, Figure 3B & C and Supplementary
Figure 3). RG7388 in combination with cisplatin and
doxorubicin at their respective GI50 concentrations showed
moderate antagonism in the NB1691 cells, but this was not
observed when the average of CI values at ED50, ED75 and
ED90 were taken into account (Table 2 and Figure 3B & C).

analysis for p53 pathway activation and flow cytometry
for sub-G1 and cell cycle phase distribution at 72 hours
post-treatment (Figure 4A & B and Supplementary Figure
4A & B). In addition, cells were also assessed for caspase
3/7 activity as an indicator of apoptosis at 24 hours
post-treatment (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure
4C). Overall, for all combination treatments, there was
an increase in the number of detached cells compared
to vehicle control and either treatment alone (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure 4A). Western analysis
demonstrated that treatment of p53 wt neuroblastoma
cells with RG7388 and chemotherapy agents alone and
in combination led to p53 stabilisation and activation of
the p53 pathway (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure
4A). Furthermore, combination treatment in almost all
cases induced greater levels of p53 stabilisation compared
to the chemotherapy agent alone, and in some cases this
was also greater than those induced by RG7388 alone. In
response to treatment with GI50 concentrations of RG7388
for 72 hours, SHSY5Y and LAN5 cells demonstrated an
increase in both sub-G1 events and G1:S ratios, indicative
of induction of apoptosis and a G1 cell cycle arrest,
respectively (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4B). In
contrast, NGP cells only exhibited an increase in G1:S ratio
(Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4B). Overall, at GI50
concentrations, RG7388 was more potent than the tested
chemotherapy agents at consistently inducing a cell cycle
arrest in SHSY5Y, NGP and LAN5 cells. Assessment of
caspase 3/7 activity as a marker of apoptosis demonstrated
that GI50 concentrations of RG7388 or chemotherapy agent
alone led to an increase in activity levels in SHSY5Y
and LAN5 cells (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure
4C), however, only GI50 concentrations of busulfan and
topotecan led to an increase in activity levels in NGP cells.
Overall, combination treatments led to greater caspase 3/7
activity in p53 wt neuroblastoma cells compared to vehicle
control and single treatment alone, suggesting enhanced
tumour cell killing (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure
4C). In addition, in the majority of cases, increases in
caspase 3/7 activity at 24 hours post-treatment (Figure 4C
and Supplementary Figure 4C) were consistent with the
accumulation of sub-G1 events 72 hours post-treatment
(Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4B).

Discussion

RG7388 in combination with chemotherapies
leads to increased apoptosis

Chemotherapy remains an essential component
of multimodal cancer treatment, but can result in severe
short and long-term toxicity. In the modern era of cancer
therapeutics there is a drive towards the identification and
use of targeted agents to enhance cancer specific killing
while reducing toxicity. The use of MDM2-p53 antagonists
represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy in
neuroblastoma, where the incidence of p53 mutations is
much lower in comparison to adult malignancies and p53
mutations are rare even at relapse (reviewed by [13]). This

Functional evaluation of RG7388 in combination
with cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan, temozolomide
and busulfan was performed in p53 wt SHSY5Y, NGP
and LAN5 cells. Cells were treated with their respective
GI50 concentrations for RG7388 and the chemotherapy
agent alone, and in combination, and then assessed by
light microscopy for morphological appearance, Western

amplified versus MYCN amplified cell lines in the present
study, in contrast to Gamble et al [18].
RG7388 induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis
in all p53 wt neuroblastoma cell lines tested, and in
most cases induction of apoptosis demonstrated by an
increase in caspase 3/7 activity and sub-G1 events in a
concentration-dependent manner. Cell cycle arrest was
not always accompanied by induction of apoptosis, and
overall, a higher concentration of RG7388 was required to
induce apoptosis compared to a G1 arrest, consistent with
previous observations and the p53 apoptotic threshold in
p53 wt tumour cells [17, 28]. MYCN amplified cell lines,
LAN5 and IMR32, were the only cell lines which did not
demonstrate a ≥ 2-fold increase in G1:S ratios, indicative
of a G1 cell cycle arrest, in response to treatment with at
least one or more concentrations of RG7388. This latter
result is in part consistent with our previous observations
of a failure of MYCN amplified cell lines to undergo G1
arrest following irradiation-induced DNA damage [29];
however, this did not extend to the MDM2 and MYCN
co-amplified cell lines NGP and NB1691 as a ≥ 2-fold
increase in G1:S ratio was observed.
Despite evidence of single-agent activity, the
development of resistance mechanisms may ultimately
limit the efficacy of MDM2-p53 antagonists given alone
[12]. Most likely, MDM2-p53 antagonists will be used in
combination, initially with existing chemotherapies and/
or radiotherapy, and then with other novel targeted agents.
The ideal combinations should lead to synergistic cancer
cell killing while reducing the toxicity associated with
intensive chemotherapy regimens presently used, which
is particularly important in young children. To this end,
the present study assessed whether RG7388 synergises
with 5 chemotherapy agents most commonly used
during frontline treatment at diagnosis or relapse, namely
cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan (induction), busulfan
(consolidation) and temozolomide (relapse) in 5 p53 wt
neuroblastoma cell lines.
In particular, cisplatin is associated with
nephrotoxicity and ototoxcitiy, topotecan and doxorubicin
are associated with significant myelosuppression and
high-dose doxorubicin with cardiotoxicity. Temozolomide
is used in a refractory/relapsed disease setting, and
high-dose busulfan is presently given with high-dose
melphalan followed by autologous haematopoietic
stem cell rescue in the consolidation phase of high-risk
neuroblastoma treatment, and is associated with significant
non-haematological side-effects including liver (venoocclusive disease) and lung toxicity [30]. Overall, the
majority of RG7388 and chemotherapy combinations
ranged from slightly synergistic to synergistic in line with
CI values observed by previous studies of Nutlin-3 and
chemotherapy, in other cancer types [31, 32]. In most
cases, combination treatment led to greater stabilisation
of p53 and increased apoptosis, as evident by higher
levels of caspase-3/7 activity compared to either agent

study demonstrates for the first time the highly selective
and potent in vitro anti-tumour activity of RG7388 as a
single agent in p53 wt neuroblastoma of varying MYCN,
MDM2 and p14ARF genetic status, resulting in p53
stabilisation and activation of the p53 pathway.
Within the present panel of p53 wt neuroblastoma
cell lines, the highest RG7388 GI50 concentrations (≥
80 nM) were obtained in MYCN non-amplified cell
lines of which 4/5 cell lines (SKNRA, SJNB1, SHEP
and GIMEN) comprise predominantly S-type (substrate
adherent) cells [21] and 3 cell lines (SHEP, GIMEN and
LAN6) have p14ARF aberrations [22]. These observations
are consistent with previous studies showing that MYCN
sensitises neuroblastoma cell lines to MDM2-p53
antagonists, Nutlin-3 and MI-63 [18], and p14ARF silencing
leads to resistance to Nutlin-3 induced apoptosis [19].
Furthermore, the reduced sensitivity of S-type cells to
RG7388 compared to N-type (neuronal) cells is consistent
with previous reports of different outcomes of S- versus
N-type neuroblastoma cells in response to p53 activation,
including Nutlin-3 and MI-63, where N-type cells are
more likely to undergo apoptosis in contrast to S-type
cells which undergo a G1 cell cycle arrest [18, 21, 23,
24]. In response to 10× GI50 concentrations of RG7388,
the one predominantly S-type (S>N) and all the N-type
neuroblastoma cell lines tested in the present study
demonstrated increased caspase 3/7 activity, whereas
S-type SKNRA cells did not.
The difference between the mean RG7388 GI50
concentrations of MYCN amplified versus non-amplified
cell lines was not statistically significant, in contrast to
our previous study with Nutlin-3 and MI-63 [18] but
consistent with another [19]. However, in line with
Gamble et al [18], sensitivity of MYCN non-amplified
neuroblastoma cell lines to RG7388 were more varied
compared with MYCN amplified cell lines. In the isogenic
system, however, Tet21N MYCN+ cells were significantly
more sensitive to RG7388, as well as to other structurally
diverse MDM2-p53 antagonists, namely, NDD0005, MI63 and Nutlin-3a, compared with Tet21N MYCN- cells.
This result is consistent with previous studies of Nutlin-3
and MI-63 in this paired cell line [18, 25], and the greater
sensitivity of Tet21N MYCN+ cells to chemotherapy [26].
Increased sensitivity of Tet21N cells to RG7388 and other
MDM2-p53 antagonists in the presence of MYCN, may
be explained by our previous observations that p53 is a
direct transcriptional target of MYCN [20]. Consistent
with this, the present study demonstrated higher basal p53
levels in Tet21N MYCN+ cells, as previously reported
[20]. Furthermore, in response to RG7388 treatment there
was greater p53 stabilisation and induction of PUMA
compared with Tet21N MYCN- cells, despite being
treated with a lower concentration of RG7388. MDM2
has also previously been reported as a direct target gene of
MYCN [27], however we did not observe any difference
in RG7388 sensitivity between MYCN and MDM2 cowww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

alone. Furthermore, analysis of CI values against caspase
3/7 activity of combination treatments demonstrated a
significant correlation between increased synergy and
increased apoptosis (Spearman’s Correlation, P < 0.0001)
in SHSY5Y and NGP cells (Supplementary Figure 5).
Taking into consideration the toxicity profiles of
the chemotherapeutics tested, and the reported cytopenias
associated with RG7112/RG7388, the most rational and
clinically relevant combinations of RG7388 are with
temozolomide or busulfan. We propose that following
Phase I evaluation of RG7388 alone, it is tested alongside
a temozolomide backbone in a randomised Phase II setting
possibly as an additional arm of the BEACON trial (www.
clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01114555). In addition, RG7388
could be combined with lower than currently used doses
of busulfan to try and reduce the non-haematological doselimiting toxicities of busulfan, such as veno-occlusive
disease of the liver and lungs [30]. Here myelosuppression
is not a concern as busulfan is given immediately prior to
autologous haematopoietic stem cell rescue.
Future in vivo studies to support observations of the
present in vitro study, including dosing and scheduling,
will need to be conducted in appropriate in vivo models
of both efficacy and toxicity prior to clinical evaluations
of RG7388 in neuroblastoma patients. For MDM2-p53
antagonists murine transgenic models may not be
suitable as despite a high degree of homology between
human and mouse MDM2 [33], MDM2-p53 antagonists
display interspecies selectivity, with reduced binding
affinities for mouse and rat MDM2 [34, 35]. Consistent
with this, we have observed that cell lines derived from
MYCN transgenic mice are less sensitive to MDM2-p53
antagonists than human neuroblastoma cell lines (Chen et
al, manuscript in preparation).
In conclusion, the current study is the first to report
the highly potent anti-tumour in vitro activity of RG7388
in p53 wt neuroblastoma cells as a single agent, and
synergistic activity with conventional chemotherapies
routinely used to treat neuroblastoma patients. This
data supports the clinical evaluation of RG7388 alone
or in combination, in particular with temozolomide or
busulfan, as a novel therapeutic strategy to potentially
improve survival and/or reduce toxicity of patients with
neuroblastoma. The presence of wt p53 remains the most
robust predictive biomarker of response to RG7388,
however MYCN, MDM2 and p14ARF status should also
be recorded. Further identification and validation of noninvasive, reliable pharmacodynamic proof-of-mechanism
tumour biomarkers of response to RG7388 are also
necessary to support the clinical evaluation of this class of
novel inhibitors in children with neuroblastoma.

Chemicals
RG7388 was provided by Hoffman-La Roche
(Nutley, NJ, USA) [6]. Nutlin-3a was purchased from
Cambridge Bioscience Ltd (Cambridge, UK). MI-63
and NDD0005 were synthesised as previously described
[36, 37]. Cisplatin (Merck Millipore, Watford, UK) was
dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF). Doxorubicin,
topotecan, temozolomide and busulfan (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO).

Cell lines
Human neuroblastoma cell lines used and their
MYCN, p53, MDM2 and p14ARF genetic status are listed
in Table 1. N_N20R1 and N_M5R1 were generated from
parental NGP cells with resistance to 20 µM Nutlin-3 or
5 µM MI-63, respectively. Both cell lines harbour p53
point mutations at codon 152 (exon 5) with N_M5R1
having a second point mutation at codon 176 (exon 5),
and N_N20R1 having a second mutation at codon 98
(exon 4) (J. Lunec, unpublished). All neuroblastoma cell
lines were obtained between 1996 and 2007 and were
validated upon receipt using cytogenetic analysis courtesy
of Dr Nick Bown (Institute of Human Genetics, Newcastle
University), and maintained as previously described [38].
To switch off MYCN, Tet21N cells were cultured in the
presence of 1 μg/mL of tetracycline (Sigma) for at least
24 hours. p53 wt, MDM2 amplified human osteosarcoma
SJSA-1 cells obtained from the ATCC were cultured
in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS.
Photomicrographs were captured using a VisiCam®
digital camera and analyser software (VWR International
Ltd, Lutterworth, UK).

Growth inhibition assays and median-effect
analysis
Seventy-two hour growth inhibition assays and
GI50 concentration determination were performed as
previously described [38]. For combination studies, cells
were treated for 72 hours with RG7388 and conventional
chemotherapies alone and in combination simultaneously
at constant 1:1 ratios of 0.25×, 0.5×, 1×, 2× and 4×, or
0.125×, 0.25×, 0.5×, 1× and 2×, their respective GI50
concentrations, depending on the drug solubility. Medianeffect analysis and Combination Index (CI) values were
determined using CalcuSyn v2 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
Experiments were at least n=3.
