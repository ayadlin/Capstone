ABSTRACT
We previously described diaryl trifluorothiazoline compound 1a (hereafter
referred to as fluorizoline) as a first-in-class small molecule that induces p53independent apoptosis in a wide range of tumor cell lines. Fluorizoline directly binds
to prohibitin 1 and 2 (PHBs), two proteins involved in the regulation of several
cellular processes, including apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that fluorizoline-induced
apoptosis is mediated by PHBs, as cells depleted of these proteins are highly resistant
to fluorizoline treatment. In addition, BAX and BAK are necessary for fluorizolineinduced cytotoxic effects, thereby proving that apoptosis occurs through the intrinsic
pathway. Expression analysis revealed that fluorizoline induced the upregulation of
Noxa and Bim mRNA levels, which was not observed in PHB-depleted MEFs. Finally,
Noxa-/-/Bim-/- MEFs and NOXA-downregulated HeLa cells were resistant to fluorizolineinduced apoptosis. All together, these findings show that fluorizoline requires PHBs
to execute the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

INTRODUCTION

Interestingly, the diaryl trifluorothiazoline compound 1a
(Figure 1a), hereafter referred to as fluorizoline, triggered
apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism, which is
highly relevant as half of all cancers acquire mutations in
p53 during the malignant transformation [3]. In addition,
we identified prohibitin 1 and 2 (PHBs) as proteins
selectively binding to fluorizoline [2].
PHBs are evolutionary conserved, ubiquitously
expressed proteins that are required for cellular
proliferation, development, and the functional integrity

Resistance to cell death is one of the hallmarks of
cancer development, and it compromises the efficacy
of conventional anti-cancer agents [1]. Hence, there is
need for the development of novel apoptosis-inducing
compounds as potential therapies for cancer. In a
previous report we described the synthesis of a class
of small molecules with an unprecedented fluorinated
thiazoline scaffold as novel pro-apoptotic compounds [2].

of mitochondria [4-6]. Consistently, depletion of PHBs
leads to an impairment in embryonic development in
Caenorhabditis elegans and mice [7-10]. PHBs are
predominantly found in mitochondria, but they have also
been identified in other cell compartments, including the
plasma membrane and the nucleus [4, 11]. Within the
inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), PHB1 and PHB2
interact with each other to form large heteromeric ringlike complexes, which presumably serve as membrane
scaffolds [6, 12]. Cells depleted of PHBs show fragmented
mitochondria with an altered ultrastructure, as well as
marked degradation of L-OPA1 [10, 13], a mitochondrial
dynamin-like GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fusion
and maintains cristae structure [14, 15]. In addition, PHBs
have been linked to oxidative stress, as their absence
induces the production of reactive oxygen species [16-19],
and their overexpression protects against oxidative stress
[18, 20, 21]. Loss of PHBs leads to impaired proliferation
[10, 13, 22] and increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli
[10, 11, 18, 23-25]. Thus, PHBs play a key role in the
maintenance of the functional integrity of mitochondria,
which ultimately allows proper cell and tissue homeostasis
[4,6,26-28].
The role of PHBs in cancer remains controversial
[11, 29]. An anti-tumorigenic role for PHBs was reported
in various tumor cell types [30-33]. In contrast, PHBs have
been linked to tumor growth, resistance to chemotherapy
and metastasis [11, 29, 34]. The requirement of PHBs
for cell proliferation strongly indicates a potential role
in cancer progression [4, 11, 12, 22, 35]. Along this line,
overexpression of PHB1 results in a higher resistance
to apoptosis in different types of cancer cells, while
downregulation of PHBs renders cancer cells more
susceptible to pro-apoptotic insults [11, 21, 29, 36],
suggesting a pro-tumorigenic role of PHBs.
In view of the pleiotropic functions of PHBs, these
proteins emerge as highly interesting targets for the
development of novel treatments for cancer [11, 29, 37].
In this regard, we propose that PHB-binding fluorizoline
is a promising new agent due to its pro-apoptotic capacity.
Here we further dissect the mechanism by which
fluorizoline induces apoptosis and demonstrate that this
compound requires PHBs to increase Noxa and Bim
expression and to trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway.

whether the pro-apoptotic effects of this compound require
PHBs, we sought to analyze the response of PHB-deficient
cells to fluorizoline treatment. To this end, we used
Phb2fl/fl MEFs, in which Cre-recombinase transduction
induces loss of the Phb2 gene [10]. PHBs are
interdependent at the protein level, thus loss of PHB2
leads to the degradation of PHB1 [9, 10]. As a control, we
used wild type (WT) MEFs, in which Cre-recombinase
transduction does not modify PHB protein levels.
Seventy-two hours after Cre-recombinase transduction,
WT and Phb2fl/fl MEFs were treated with increasing doses
of fluorizoline for 24 h, and cell viability was analyzed
by flow cytometry. While WT MEFs were sensitive to
fluorizoline treatment, loss of PHBs conferred strong
resistance to fluorizoline-induced apoptosis in Cretransduced Phb2fl/fl MEFs (Phb2-/- MEFs) (Figure 1b).
In contrast, both cell lines showed a similar response to
Actinomycin D (ActD). Western blot analysis revealed
that Cre-mediated depletion of Phb2 was accompanied
by loss of PHB1 and L-OPA1 (Figure 1c), as previously
described [10]. In addition, fluorizoline treatment led to
cleavage of caspase 3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) in WT MEFs, thereby indicating induction of
apoptosis. In contrast, the cleavage of these two proteins
was clearly reduced in fluorizoline-treated Phb2-/- MEFs
(Figure 1c). Contrary to fluorizoline, ActD triggered
similar cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP in WT and Phb2-/MEFs. Furthermore, disappearance of L-OPA1 forms was
observed in fluorizoline- and ActD- treated WT MEFs.
Treatment with fluorizoline triggered apoptosis
in WT and Phb2fl/fl MEFs in a similar manner in the
absence of Cre-recombinase (Supplementary Figure 1a).
Accordingly, fluorizoline and ActD induced a similar
processing of caspase 3, PARP, and L-OPA1 in WT and
Phb2fl/fl MEFs (Supplementary Figure 1b). These findings
demonstrate that the resistance observed in Phb2-/- MEFs
was not due to intrinsic insensitivity to apoptotic insults of
the cell line but to the loss of PHBs.
In order to corroborate that lack of PHBs confers
resistance to fluorizoline-induced apoptosis, Phb2 levels
were downregulated by siRNA transfection in Phb2fl/fl
MEFs. Reduction of Phb2 resulted in decreases of PHB1
and L-OPA1 (Figure 1e). As expected, the pro-apoptotic
effects of fluorizoline were blocked when PHBs were
downregulated, as shown by flow cytometry and western
blot analysis (Figure 1d-1e). These results were further
confirmed by Phb2 siRNA transfection in WT MEFs
(Supplementary Figure 1c-d). All together, these findings
demonstrate that PHBs are necessary for fluorizolineinduced apoptosis.
Furthermore, we sought to analyze whether
modulation of PHB expression levels affects the sensitivity
to fluorizoline. To this end, PHBs were overexpressed
in Phb2fl/fl MEFs and the response to fluorizoline was
examined. Interestingly, fluorizoline efficiently triggered

apoptosis in spite of PHB overexpression (Supplementary
Figure 2a-b). Similar results were obtained by
overexpressing PHBs in HeLa cells (Supplementary
Figure 2c-d).
In addition, the pro-apoptotic effects of fluorizoline
were analyzed in Phb2fl/- MEFs, which show lower levels
of PHBs compared to Phb2fl/fl (Supplementary Figure
3a). Cells were incubated with fluorizoline for 24 h and
viability was analyzed by flow cytometry. Strikingly,
Phb2fl/- and Phb2fl/fl clones displayed similar sensitivity to
fluorizoline treatment (Supplementary Figure 3b). Taken
together, these results show that the protein levels of PHBs
do not strictly correlate with the sensitivity to fluorizoline.
Resistance to fluorizoline can only be observed in the
absence of PHBs.

Upon apoptosis induction with various stimuli, the
mitochondrial network undergoes extensive fragmentation,
along with cristae remodeling [38-41]. Interestingly, this
phenotype was also observed upon loss of PHBs, which
was attributed to the accelerated processing of L-OPA1
[10, 13]. We sought to analyze mitochondrial morphology
and ultrastructure after fluorizoline treatment. HeLa
cells incubated with fluorizoline presented fragmented
mitochondria that clustered around the nucleus (Figure
2a), as well as disarrangements of cristae, which appeared
dilated and disorganized (Figure 2b). Higher magnification
micrographs (60,000X) showed that incubation with
fluorizoline induced partial or total loss of cristae, along
with remodeling of the IMM into many separate vesicular

Therefore, these results show that fluorizoline treatment

leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae
disorganization. These findings are consistent with the

capacity of fluorizoline to induce apoptosis and with PHBs
being the target of this compound.
To analyze the role of OPA1 in fluorizoline-induced
apoptosis, we overexpressed variant 1 of OPA1 lacking
the S1 cleavage site (OPA1-ΔS1), a non-cleavable
long form of OPA1 [42]. Strikingly, fluorizoline could
efficiently induce apoptosis in the presence of OPA1-ΔS1

(Supplementary Figure 4a-b), suggesting that the loss
of L-OPA1 is not required for the pro-apoptotic effects
of fluorizoline. To confirm these results, we used MEFs
lacking OMA1, a mitochondrial protease that cleaves
OPA1 in response to several stress insults [43-47].
Fluorizoline treatment triggered the loss of L-OPA1 in WT
MEFs, while Oma1-/- MEFs maintained L-OPA1 forms
even in the presence of fluorizoline. In contrast, WT and
Oma1-/- MEFs showed a similar response to fluorizoline
(Supplementary Figure 4c-d). All together, these results
prove that fluorizoline does not rely on stress-induced loss
of L-OPA1 forms to induce apoptosis.

Fluorizoline increases the production of reactive
oxygen species independently of PHBs and
apoptosis induction
We analyzed the effects of fluorizoline on the
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) as an indicator
of mitochondrial function. As apoptosis induction can
affect ΔΨm [39], it was important to analyze ΔΨm before
the onset of cell death. To this end, we used Jurkat cells, as
previous results from our group showed that cytochrome
c was released from mitochondria after 8 h of fluorizoline
treatment [2]. Interestingly, 8 h of fluorizoline treatment
resulted only in a slight loss of ΔΨm (Supplementary
Figure 5), which suggests that it is a consequence of
apoptosis induction.
In addition, we sought to analyze whether treatment
with fluorizoline leads to generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) by using CellROX® Deep Red reagent,
which detects superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical.
Jurkat cells showed increased ROS production upon
treatment with fluorizoline for 1 h (Figure 3a). In order
to study the involvement of ROS in fluorizoline-induced
apoptosis, we pre-treated cells with the SOD mimetic
manganese (III)-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin
(MnTBAP), which efficiently inhibited fluorizolineinduced ROS production (Figure 1d), while it could
not revert the apoptotic effects of fluorizoline (Figure
3c). Furthermore, we analyzed the production of ROS
in Phb2-downregulated MEFs, which were resistant to
fluorizoline-induced apoptosis (Figure 1a). Importantly,
the absence of PHBs could not inhibit the generation of
ROS induced by fluorizoline (Figure 3d). All together,
these results demonstrate that fluorizoline does not require
the generation of ROS to induce apoptosis.

Fluorizoline induces the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner
The execution of apoptosis depends on the balance

[48, 49]. BAX and BAK are two multidomain proapoptotic proteins whose activation leads to mitochondrial

outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the
release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins such
as cytochrome c, two critical steps in the execution of
apoptosis [48, 49]. In order to evaluate the role of BAX
and BAK in fluorizoline-induced apoptosis, we used
Bax-/-, Bak-/- and Bax-/-/Bak-/- MEFs, which are resistant
to multiple cell death stimuli that induce apoptosis
through MOMP [50]. Importantly, fluorizoline triggered
apoptosis in WT MEFs, while the absence of both BAX
and BAK significantly prevented the cytotoxic effects of
this compound (Figure 4a). Bax-/- MEFs were as sensitive
to fluorizoline as WT MEFs, although Bak-/- MEFs
offered some resistance to the apoptosis induced by this
compound.
To corroborate these results, HeLa cells were

transiently depleted of these two pro-apoptotic proteins
by siRNA transfection (Figure 4b). Consistently, depletion
of BAX and BAK reduced the apoptotic response to
fluorizoline treatment (Figure 4c).
To confirm the importance of the activation of
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, we used Jurkat cells
overexpressing BCL-XL [51]. This is an anti-apoptotic
member of the BCL-2 family, whose overexpression
can block the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis [51, 52].
Fluorizoline was able to induce apoptosis in WT Jurkat
cells, while overexpression of BCL-XL conferred
resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects of fluorizoline
(Supplementary Figure 6a-b).
Although the lack of BAX and BAK conferred
significant resistance to fluorizoline treatment, cell

expression of various BCL-2 family members
upon fluorizoline treatment

viability was still slightly decreased. Pre-treatment of
Bax-/-/Bak-/- MEFs with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VDOPh completely blocked fluorizoline-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure 6c). As the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway is blocked in the absence of BAX and BAK, we
assessed the role of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by
adding the caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK. Strikingly,
inhibiting caspase 8 activity did not have any effect on
fluorizoline-induced apoptosis in WT MEFs, while it
could efficiently prevent the pro-apoptotic effects of
fluorizoline in Bax-/-/Bak-/- MEFs (Supplementary Figure
6c). To corroborate these results, we used Bax-/-/Bak-/MEFs overexpressing CrmA, a cowpox virus protein that
preferentially inhibits caspase 8 [53]. Consistently, CrmA
effectively inhibited apoptosis induced by fluorizoline
in Bax-/-/Bak-/- MEFs (Supplementary Figure 6d). All
together, these findings show that the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway is essential for fluorizoline-induced
apoptosis. Strikingly, in the absence of BAX and BAK,
fluorizoline induces a minor decrease in viability by
activating caspase 8.

To gain insight into the mechanism of apoptosis
induction upon fluorizoline treatment, changes in the
overall apoptosis mRNA expression profile were analyzed
by reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (RT-MLPA) in Phb2fl/fl MEFs. After 24
h of treatment with 20 μM fluorizoline, the upregulation of
the pro-apoptotic genes Bim, Noxa, Bmf, and Moap1 was
observed, along with downregulation of the anti-apoptotic
genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-X (Figure 5a and Supplementary
Figure 7a).
Fluorizoline-induced apoptosis requires the presence
of PHBs (Figure 1). It is therefore conceivable that the
modulations observed in apoptosis-related gene expression
do not occur in cells lacking PHBs. To test this hypothesis,
we transduced Phb2fl/fl MEFs with Cre-recombinase for
72 h and then treated them with 20 μM fluorizoline for
24 h. Importantly, Cre-mediated loss of PHBs abolished

the modulations of mRNA levels triggered by fluorizoline
(Figure 5b and Supplementary Figure 7b). Thus, the
presence of PHBs is required for fluorizoline-induced
changes in the apoptosis-related mRNA expression profile.
Interestingly, treatment with fluorizoline increased
BIM protein levels in Phb2fl/fl MEFs, although these levels
were not modulated in Phb2-/- MEFs (Supplementary
Figure 8). NOXA protein levels could not be analyzed due
to lack of proper antibodies with the capacity to detect the
mouse protein (data not shown). Consequently, we further

studied fluorizoline-induced apoptosis by analyzing
changes in the expression of BCL-2 family members in
HeLa cells, as there are more antibodies available for the
detection of human BCL-2 family proteins.
First, the apoptosis-related gene expression profile
was examined by RT-MLPA in HeLa cells. Treatment
with 10 μM fluorizoline increased the pro-apoptotic BIM,
PUMA, NOXA, and BAK mRNA levels (Figure 6a and
Supplementary Figure 9). Next, we sought to examine
whether these modulations of the mRNA levels resulted
in changes in the corresponding protein levels. We
observed a time-dependent upregulation of NOXA and
BIM, as well as decreases in PUMA and MCL-1 protein
levels (Figure 6b). Despite the decreases in BCL-2 mRNA
levels, fluorizoline did not significantly modulate its
protein levels, a finding consistent with the long half-life
of this protein [54]. In addition, PHB protein levels were
not modified upon fluorizoline treatment. Interestingly,
increases in NOXA and BIM preceded caspase activation,
as pre-incubation with pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh
did not block their upregulation (Figure 6c). In contrast,
caspase inhibition abolished the decrease in MCL-1
mediated by fluorizoline treatment, thereby demonstrating
that it is a caspase-dependent event. Thus, PHBs mediate
fluorizoline-induced changes in Noxa and Bim expression,
the protein levels of which increased prior to caspase
activation. These modulations could explain the apoptotic
outcome observed.
To validate the increases in BIM and NOXA protein
levels, we analyzed the effects of fluorizoline in primary
cancer cells. Specifically, we used cells from four patients
with different hematological malignancies, namely
chronic myeloid leukemia-derived blast crisis, mantle cell
lymphoma, B cell chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome
and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Interestingly,
treatment with fluorizoline resulted in a decrease in
viability and an increase in NOXA protein levels, whereas
BIM protein levels were not modified (Supplementary
Figure 10a-d). We also analyzed changes in BCL-2 family
members following fluorizoline treatment in various
cancer cell lines. NOXA and BIM protein levels increased
in a dose-dependent manner in HT-29, a colon cancer cell
line, as well as in A375P and WM1552, two melanoma
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 10e-f). In Jurkat cells,
we only observed fluorizoline-induced increases in
NOXA protein levels (Supplementary Figure 10g). Hence,
fluorizoline seems to mainly increase NOXA protein
levels, while BIM is also upregulated in some cancer cells.

Role of NOXA and BIM in fluorizoline-induced
apoptosis
We sought to further study the role of NOXA
and BIM in fluorizoline-induced apoptosis. To this end,
we performed a viability assay in MEFs lacking Noxa,

Bim, or both. Noxa-/-/Bim-/- MEFs were resistant to
the pro-apoptotic effects of fluorizoline, whereas WT,
Noxa-/- and Bim-/- MEFs showed a similar sensitivity to this
compound (Figure 7a). In addition, NOXA and BIM were
downregulated by siRNA transfection in HeLa cells and
their response to fluorizoline treatment was assessed. Cells
lacking BIM were sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects
of fluorizoline, while lack of NOXA conferred resistance
to these effects. Simultaneous depletion of NOXA and
BIM did not increase resistance to this compound when
compared to depletion of NOXA alone (Figure 7b-7c).
All together, these data demonstrate that
fluorizoline induces the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
predominantly through the upregulation of NOXA and,
depending on the cell type, also of BIM.

reported to have an anti-tumorigenic role [31, 32]. Thus,
the induction of apoptosis by targeting PHBs emerges as a
new therapy for cancer.
The exact mechanism by which fluorizoline induces
apoptosis remains to be elucidated. The loss of either
PHB1 or PHB2 may destabilize mitochondrial PHBs
complexes, leading to the activation of quality control
mechanisms, which would in turn degrade the other
partner [6, 58]. Therefore, the observation that PHB
protein levels are maintained upon fluorizoline treatment
suggests that the PHBs ring-like complex in the IMM is
not destabilized. Treatment with fluorizoline increased the
production of ROS, as observed in the absence of PHBs in
various cell types [16-19, 24, 59, 60]. However, we proved
that the generation of ROS was independent of PHBs
and apoptosis induction, discarding oxidative stress as a
mechanism of action of fluorizoline. PHBs are known to
physically interact with several subunits of complex I and
II of the respiratory chain, presumably contributing to their
proper assembly and stability [61-63]. In fact, deletion of
PHBs decreases the activity of various complexes of the
respiratory chain [16, 26, 59]. We cannot exclude that
fluorizoline will affect the activity of these complexes due
to its PHBs-binding properties.
Treatment with fluorizoline induces fragmentation
of the mitochondrial network, cristae remodeling and
loss of L-OPA1, which is consistent with the role of this
protein in mitochondrial fusion and in the maintenance
of cristae structure [14, 15]. Strikingly, PHB-depleted
cells also present fragmented mitochondrial network and
aberrant cristae morphogenesis, which are attributed to
the loss of L-OPA1 [10]. However, it is worth mentioning
that this observation cannot be exclusively interpreted as
a proof that fluorizoline targets PHBs. Other apoptotic
stimuli have been reported to trigger the same changes
in mitochondrial structure [38-41] and the processing
of L-OPA1 [42, 64, 65], which allows reorganization of
mitochondrial cristae and facilitates cytochrome c release
[66, 67]. Our results demonstrate that fluorizoline was able
to induce apoptosis independently of the loss of L-OPA1
forms, which excludes this event as the cause of apoptosis
induction.
We have shown that fluorizoline triggers the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway, as BAX and BAK are required for
fluorizoline-induced apoptosis. The protection observed
in Bak-/- MEFs could be related to the recently reported
requirement of BAK for efficient BAX translocation and
oligomerization at the outer mitochondrial membrane [68].
The activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway involving
BCL-2 family members appears to be necessary for the
successful outcome of many cancer treatments [48].
Expression analysis revealed a consistent upregulation of
two BH3-only proteins, namely the activator Bim and the
sensitizer Noxa in MEF and HeLa cells upon fluorizoline
treatment. Of note, these modulations were dependent on
the presence of PHBs in MEFs.

DISCUSSION
In the present study we describe the mechanism of
apoptosis induction exerted by fluorizoline, a new proapoptotic agent with a fluorinated thiazoline scaffold. It
was previously described that fluorizoline directly binds
to PHB1 and PHB2 [2]. Here we show that PHBs mediate
the pro-apoptotic effects of fluorizoline through two
approaches. Depletion of Phb2 either by Cre-mediated
recombination in Phb2fl/fl MEFs or by siRNA transfection
in MEFs conferred resistance to fluorizoline. Hence,
fluorizoline is a new synthetic agent that reduces cell
viability by specifically targeting PHBs.
PHBs play a key role in the maintenance of
mitochondrial homeostasis. High expression of PHBs has
been found in cells that heavily depend on mitochondrial
function, notably proliferating cells. It is conceivable
that these cells are particularly susceptible to the lack of
functional PHBs [4]. In fact, downregulation of PHBs in
various cell lines blocks cell proliferation [10, 22, 35]
and also induces apoptosis [13, 55, 56]. Overexpression
of PHBs protects cells from apoptosis induced by various
stimuli, an observation that is consistent with PHB1
having a cytoprotective role [11]. In MEFs, PHBs exert
their anti-apoptotic function via L-OPA1, as the increased
sensitivity to apoptosis observed in the absence of PHBs
can be counteracted by re-expression of a non-cleavable
variant of L-OPA1 [10]. In addition, it has been reported
that PHB overexpression inhibits apoptosis through
the induction of BCL-2 and BCL-XL [23] and that
downregulation of PHBs reduces BCL-XL levels [57].
Interestingly, overexpression of BCL-XL protected cells
from fluorizoline-induced apoptosis.
The role of PHBs in cancer has been largely
discussed. Although some reports point to an antitumorigenic role of PHBs, a growing body of evidence
links these proteins to tumor development [11, 21, 29,
34, 35]. Fluorizoline has the capacity to induce apoptosis
in a wide range of cancer cell lines, including glioma
and prostate cancer cell lines [2], in which PHBs were

Importantly, fluorizoline induced increases in
NOXA and BIM protein levels prior to caspase activation,
which could explain the apoptotic outcome. NOXA
and BIM are essential for the induction of apoptosis in
response to a variety of pro-apoptotic insults [48, 69-71].
The lack of NOXA in HeLa cells conferred resistance
to the pro-apoptotic effects of fluorizoline, although this
was not observed in Noxa-/- MEFs. These observations are
consistent with the reported differences in the apoptotic
potential of NOXA in function of the cell type [70].
Specifically, NOXA overexpression induces significant
apoptosis in HeLa cells [72], while in MEFs it is poorly
apoptotic [73, 74]. In MEFs, lack of NOXA and BIM
conferred significant resistance to fluorizoline-induced
apoptosis, thus revealing a key role for these BH3-only
proteins in the mechanism of action of fluorizoline. On
the other hand, downregulation of both NOXA and BIM in
HeLa cells failed to offer more protection than the absence
of NOXA alone, thereby suggesting that BIM plays only
a minor role in these cells. The consistent upregulation
of NOXA protein levels in all the cancer cell types that
were analyzed points towards a main function of this BH3only protein in fluorizoline-induced apoptosis. Compared
to PHB-depleted cells, the loss of the crucial BH3-only
proteins (i.e. NOXA and BIM for MEFs and NOXA for
HeLa cells) blocked fluorizoline-induced apoptosis less
efficiently, thus suggesting a contribution of other BCL-2
family members modulated in a PHB-dependent manner.
In addition to their role in mitochondria, PHBs also
localize in other cellular compartments, including the
nucleus and the plasma membrane, in a wide range of
cell types [11, 75]. In the plasma membrane, PHBs have
been involved in the activation of the signaling pathways
Ras-Raf-MAPK and the tyrosine kinase Syk [76-79]. In
the nucleus, PHBs were reported to regulate the activity
of various transcription factors such as p53, E2F1, and
estrogen receptor [11]. Whether the fluorizoline-induced
transcriptional modulations are directly mediated by
nuclear PHBs or indirectly mediated by PHBs in other
cellular compartments requires further analysis.
Similar to fluorizoline, the effects of three natural
products that bind to PHBs have been reported. First,
capsaicin binds to PHB2 to induce cytochrome c release
from mitochondria [80]. Second, the depsipeptide
aurilide was shown to selectively bind to PHB1 in
the mitochondria, leading to rapid mitochondrial
fragmentation and the induction of apoptosis [81]. Third,
Rocaglamide A, a member of the flavagline class of
compounds, binds to both PHB1 and PHB2 at the cell
membrane to inhibit Raf activation and Raf-MEK-ERKmediated cell cycle progression and cell proliferation
in tumor cell lines, without inducing mitochondrial
fragmentation [82]. Interestingly, Rocaglamide A and
other related flavaglines have pro-apoptotic activities
both in vitro and in vivo in various cancer cells; however,
it remains unknown whether PHBs are involved in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

their mechanism of apoptosis induction [11, 83]. The
complexity of the synthesis or the restricted availability of
these compounds may hinder their use in therapeutics. In
contrast, fluorizoline synthesis is practical, versatile, short,
and reproducible, and thus amenable to gram-scale batches
[2]. In vivo, sub-acute toxicity studies in mice revealed
that fluorizoline only produces some liver toxicity at the
higher doses that were tested (data not shown). Thus, it
would be possible to analyze its anti-tumor effects in vivo.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PHBs are
required for fluorizoline-induced apoptosis. PHBs mediate
the upregulation of NOXA and BIM, which are crucial
for the pro-apoptotic effects of fluorizoline. Moreover,
our findings reveal that PHBs are amenable to modulation
by small molecules to finally induce apoptosis, and thus
further contributes to highlighting the suitability of PHBs
as promising therapeutic targets.

Primary samples and cell isolation
Peripheral blood samples and bone marrow aspirates
from untreated patients were obtained after informed
consent in accordance with protocols approved by the
Human Research Ethics Committees of the Hospital
ICO-Duran i Reynals, L’Hospitalet de Llobregat,
Spain. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia-derived
blast crisis, mantle cell lymphoma, B cell chronic
lymphoproliferative syndrome and adult T-cell leukemia/
lymphoma were diagnosed according to standard clinical
and laboratory criteria. Peripheral blood and bone marrow
mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation on a
Biocoll (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) gradient and
cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 10%
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). Mononuclear cells were cultured
immediately after thawing or isolation at a concentration
of 1x106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 culture medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100
µg/mL streptomycin (all from Biological Industries) at
37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon
dioxide.

Transduction of MEFs with Cre-recombinase
Recombinant
His-TAT-NLS-Cre-recombinase
(HTNC) was expressed and purified as previously
described [85]. 6 μM HTNC was diluted in DMEM/PBS
(1:1), sterile filtered and applied to WT and Phb2fl/fl MEFs
for 20 h. Afterwards, cells were washed with PBS and
grown in complete medium for 48 h. MEFs were then
treated with fluorizoline for 24 h.

Transient transfection
siRNA transfection. MEFs were transfected with
scramble (12935-300) or Phb2 siRNA (MSS236022),
while HeLa cells were transfected with scramble (12935300), BAK (HSS141354, HSS141355, HSS141356),
BAX (HSS184085, HSS184086, HSS184087), NOXA

(s195011) siRNA using the Lipofectamine® RNAiMax
Reagent (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
Massachussets, USA). Complexes were added directly
to growing cells in DMEM and incubated for 24 h,
followed by washing with PBS buffer and addition of
fresh DMEM. MEFs were used in experiments 72 h after
siRNA transfection, and HeLa cells were used after 48
h. The efficiency of the downregulation was assessed
by western blot. Plasmid transfection. HeLa cells were
transfected with either pcDNA3.1, OPA1-ΔS1 construct

Jurkat cells were stained with 100 nM MitoTracker®
Red CMXRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) during the last
30 min of the treatment at 37ºC and then analyzed by flow
cytometry using MoFlo® Astrios (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
California, USA). Decreased fluorescence indicates a loss
of ∆Ψm.

HeLa cells were grown on sterilized poly-L-lysinecoated coverslips (0.01% solution, Sigma-Aldrich) and
incubated with 100 nM MitoTracker® Red CMXRos
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells
were visualized using spectral confocal microscope
(TCS-SL, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany)
and a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 N.A. immersion oil
objective (Leica Microsystems). Images were acquired
using the accompanying image processing software from
Cytovision.

RNA content was analyzed by RT-MLPA using the
SALSA MLPA KIT RM002-B1 (MEFs) and R011-C1
(HeLa cells) Apoptosis mRNA from MRC-Holland
(Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for the simultaneous
detection of 40 mRNA molecules [86]. In brief, 200 ng
total RNA were first reverse transcribed using a gene
specific primer mix. The resulting cDNA was annealed
overnight at 60°C to the RT-MLPA probe mix. Annealed
oligonucleotides were ligated by adding Ligase-65 (MRCHolland) and incubated at 54°C for 15 min. Ligation
products were amplified by PCR (35 cycles, 30 s at 95°C;
30 s at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C) with one unlabeled
and one FAM-labeled primer. PCR fragments were
separated by capillary electrophoresis on a 48-capillary
ABI-Prism 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
California, USA). Peak area and height were measured
using GeneMapper v3.0 analysis software (Applied
Biosystems). Individual peaks were calculated relative to
the sum of all peak data to normalize for fluctuations in
total signals between samples. Data are shown as the mean
± SEM relative to the mean of the controls.

Transmission electron microscopy
HeLa cells were rinsed with PBS and immediately
fixed by immersion in 0.1 M glutaraldehyde in phosphate
buffer for 2-3 h at 4°C. Cells were gently scraped,
collected, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were
treated with 1% osmium tetroxide and after dehydration
were embedded in epoxy resin (Araldite, Basel,
Switzerland). Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife
on a ultramicrotome (Ultracut, Reichert-Jung, Depew,
New York, USA), stained with uranyl actetate/lead citrate
and each sample was placed into grids to be examined in a
JEOL 1010 electron microscope equipped with a Bioscan
digital camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, California, USA).

Statistical analysis
The results are shown as the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) of values obtained in three or
more independent experiments. Statistical analysis was
performed using the Student’s t test (two-tailed) by using
GraphPad Prism 6.0c Software Inc. p values below 0.05
were considered statistically significant (*p < 0.05; **p <
0.01; ***p < 0.001).

ROS production
Superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical production
was analyzed by incubating Jurkat or MEF cells with
2.5 μM CellROX® Deep Red Reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) during the last 30 min of the treatment at
37°C. ROS production was measured by flow cytometry
using FACSCalibur and CellQuest-Pro software (BD
Biosciences), and expressed as the mean fluorescence
intensity relative to the mean of the control.
