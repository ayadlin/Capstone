with Targeted Therapies or IL-2 to Suppress Tumor Growth
and Metastases

Abstract
Immunosuppressive barricades erected by tumors during the evolution of immune escape represent a major
obstacle to many potentially effective cancer therapies and vaccines. We have shown that host interleukin
(IL)-23 suppresses the innate immune response during carcinogenesis and metastasis, independently of effects
on the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. Based on these findings, we envisioned that IL-23 neutralization might
offer a promising strategy to modulate immunosuppression, particularly in combination with immunostimulatory agents. Here we show that by itself a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) to IL-23 suppressed early
experimental lung metastases in the B16F10 mouse model of melanoma and also modestly inhibited the
subcutaneous growth of primary tumors. These antitumor effects were respectively mediated by natural killer
cells or CD8þ T cells. More notably, combinatorial treatments of anti-IL-23 mAb with IL-2 or anti-erbB2 mAb
significantly inhibited subcutaneous growth of established mammary carcinomas and suppressed established
experimental and spontaneous lung metastases. Overall, our results suggest the potential of anti-human IL-23
mAbs to improve the immunostimulatory effects of IL-2 and trastuzumab in the current management of some
advanced human cancers. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2077–86. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The role of chronic inflammation has been implicated in the
initiation and progression of a range of malignancies including
lung, liver, and gastrointestinal carcinomas (1, 2). Proinflammatory and immunosuppressive factors that can aid in this
process include interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, TGF-b, and the
bioactive lipid prostaglandin E2 (1). Indeed, tumor immunosuppression remains one of the major obstacles to many
potentially effective cancer therapies and vaccines (3, 4).
Studies from mouse models of de novo tumorigenesis and
clinical data from cancer patients have shown tumor-specific
T cell generation and infiltration into tumor sites (4, 5).
Furthermore, strategies such as active immunization results
in some patients having up to 30% of all their circulating CD8þ
T cells capable of reactivity to tumors (6). Nevertheless, the
presence of tumor-specific T cells alone is generally not

enough to result in tumor regression, as tumors induce a
tolerant microenvironment and have a range of immunosuppressive mechanisms that can suppress antitumor immunity
(7). Thus, modulation of tumor-induced immunosuppression
will be important in allowing the optimal antitumor activity of
immunotherapies to be achieved.
Recently, the heterodimeric cytokine IL-23, formed by
linkage of the p40 to a p19 subunit, has emerged as a new
player in promoting tumor growth and development (8).
Langowski and colleagues described that IL-23p19–deficient
(IL-23p19/) mice were very resistant to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate (TPA)- induced skin papillomas (8) and suggested
that CD8þ T cells were one of the targets of IL-23 suppression
since a significantly greater CD8þ infiltrate was observed in
the carcinogen-treated skin of IL-23p19–deficient mice than
in wild-type mice. More recently, we published a report
confirming Langowski's claim that IL-23p19/ mice were
very resistant to DMBA/TPA-induced skin papillomas and
further demonstrated that these mice were also highly resistant to 30 -methylcholanthrene–induced fibrosarcomas and 3
different models of experimental tumor metastases (9).
Importantly, in these tumor models where host natural killer
(NK) cells were the main effectors in controlling disease, we
reported for the first time that IL-23 suppressed natural and
cytokine-activated NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine functions. Although IL-23 has generally been associated with the
proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A, which is the signature
cytokine produced by Th17 cells (reviewed in ref. 10), interestingly, we did not see an important role for host IL-17A in

many of the tumor models where IL-23 had tumor-promoting
activity (9, 11).
Neutralization of host IL-23 may offer a promising new
approach for modulating tumor-induced immunosuppression, particularly when used in combination with immunostimulatory agents. In this study, we have shown that a
neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mouse
IL-23 (a-IL-23) alone suppressed early experimental and
spontaneous tumor metastases and, when used in combination with IL-2 or anti-erbB2 mAb treatment, significantly
inhibited established experimental and spontaneous lung
metastases or established primary breast cancer, respectively.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Inbred C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), C57BL/6 IL-12p35–deficient
(IL-12p35/),
C57BL/6
IL-12p40–deficient
/
(IL-12p40 ), C57BL/6 IL-23p19–deficient (IL-23p19/),
C57BL/6 IL-17A–deficient (IL-17A/), C57BL/6 perforin–
deficient (pfp/), C57BL/6 IFN-g–deficient (IFN-g /), and
BALB/c WT mice were bred and maintained at the Peter
MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter Mac) as described previously (9). Mice 6 to 14 weeks old were used in all experiments. BALB/c or C57BL/6 female mice were used for all
experiments with the 4T1.2 or E0771 tumors, respectively, and
all experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines set out by the Peter Mac Animal Experimental Ethics
Committee guidelines.
Tumor models
Experimental tumor metastases model. C57BL/6 WT or
gene-targeted mice were inoculated i.v. with the indicated
doses of B16F10 melanomas cells (from ATCC). Mice were
monitored and culled 14 days after tumor inoculation and
lung metastases were quantified as described previously (12).
Subcutaneous tumor model: Groups of C57BL/6 WT, IL-23p19/ or IL-12p40/ mice were injected subcutaneously with
1  106 EG7 thymoma cells (originally provided by Frank
Carbone, University of Melbourne).
Spontaneous tumor metastasis model: The indicated doses of
E0771 or 4T1.2 mammary carcinoma cells [originally provided
by Robin Anderson (Peter Mac)] were injected into the mammary fat pad of C57BL/6 WT or BALB/c WT mice.
Reagents
Anti-AGP3 [control Ig (cIg), 4D2], anti-IL-23 (16E5), and
anti-IL-12p40 (C17.8) were all grafted on the same murine
IgG1 background and kindly provided by AMGEN Incorporated. Some groups of mice were treated with control Ig
(MAC-4), anti-CD8a (53.6.7; produced in-house), anti-CD8b
(produced in-house), anti-CD4 (GK1.5; produced in-house), or
anti-asialoGM1 (Wako Chemicals), as indicated in the legends
to deplete cell subsets as previously described (9). To examine
cytokine immunotherapy of metastases, some groups of mice
received either PBS or recombinant IL-2 (Chiron Corporation)
at the indicated time points and dose in combination with

anti-AGP3, anti-IL-23, anti-IL-12p40, or anti-CD137 (3H3; produced in-house).
Statistical analysis
Significant differences in metastases or survival were determined by the Mann–Whitney U test and the log-rank sum test.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Neutralization of IL-23 enhances NK-cell–mediated
control of established experimental B16F10 lung
metastases
We have previously shown that IL-23p19/ mice have
significantly less experimental B16F10 lung metastases than
in WT mice (9). Therefore, we first assessed the effects of a
neutralizing mouse anti-mouse IL-23 (a-IL-23) mAb in this
model (Fig. 1). A single treatment of WT mice with a-IL-23
mAb given 1 day before tumor inoculation resulted in significantly fewer lung metastases than in mice treated with
control Ig (cIg (a-AGP3, on the same mouse backbone; P ¼
0.0002), with the level of tumor suppression similar to that we
have previously observed in IL-23p19/ mice (ref. 9; Fig. 1A
and B). Furthermore, a single dose of a-IL-23 mAb treatment
also reduced day 7 established B16F10 lung metastases,
although not significantly (P ¼ 0.22). In contrast, a-p40
mAb treatment, which neutralizes both IL-23 and IL-12, did
not suppress lung metastases whether given at day 1 or 7,
showing that loss of IL-12 countered the loss of IL-23. This
result was consistent with the known comparative metastases
in IL-12p35/, IL-12p40/, and IL-23p19/ mice (ref. 9;
Fig. 1B). Notably, anti-IL-23 was effective in WT, pfp/, and
IL-17A/ mice but not surprisingly totally ineffective in IL23p19/ or IL-12p40/ mice. Anti-IL-23 mAb was partially
effective in IFN-g / and IL-12p35/ mice, suggesting that
IL-23 was acting in opposition to IFN-g and IL-12 and was in
large part responsible for the higher metastatic load observed
in these mice (Fig. 1B). NK cells were the major cell population
responsible for the antitumor activity of a-IL-23 mAb treatment in the B16F10 experimental lung metastases model, as
suppression was lost following depletion of NK cells with antiASGM1 (Fig. 1C). Similar levels of metastases suppression
were observed in a-IL-23 mAb-treated mice that were injected
with anti-CD4 and/or anti-CD8 mAb compared with cIgtreated groups (P ¼ 0.0079), showing that a-IL-23 mAb control
of B16F10 lung metastases was independent of CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells.
IL-23 suppresses CD8þ T-cell control of subcutaneous
EG7 tumor growth
We next wanted to determine whether a-IL-23 mAb could
also promote adaptive immunity. We therefore tested the
therapeutic efficacy of a-IL-23 mAbs against the subcutaneous growth of EG7 (EL4-OVA), which is known to be
naturally controlled by CD8þ T cells (ref. 13; Fig. 2). The
growth of EG7 was significantly inhibited in mice that were
treated early with a-IL-23 mAb (days 1, 3, 10, 14, 17, and 21)
compared with similar groups of mice that were treated with

control a-AGP3 mAb (P ¼ 0.0002; Fig. 2A). Inhibition by a-IL23 mAb was equivalent to that observed in IL-23p19/ mice.
Similar to observations in the B16F10 metastases model, no
growth inhibition of EG7 tumor was observed in WT mice
injected with a-p40 mAb or in IL-12p40/ mice. Depletion of
CD8þ T cells in a-IL-23 mAb–treated WT mice completely
abrogated the therapeutic effect (Fig. 2B). This loss of tumor
growth inhibition was similarly observed in IL-23p19/ mice
injected with anti-CD8 mAbs. In contrast, EG7 tumor growth
was still reduced in WT mice treated with a-IL-23 mAbs or IL23p19/ mice that were depleted of NK cells. Interestingly,
treatment with a-IL-23 mAb from day 6 in WT mice bearing
more established EG7 tumors could not significantly attenuate tumor growth (Fig. 2C). Collectively, our data suggested
that neutralization of IL-23 promotes either innate or adaptive
immunity depending on the tumor model.
Anti-IL-23 mAb and IL-2 immunotherapy in
combination reduces established experimental B16F10
lung metastases
We next wanted to determine whether other immunotherapies could be improved in combination with the a-IL-23 mAb.
We had previously observed that early, high-dose IL-2 treatment of IL-23p19/ mice injected with a high dose of B16F10
tumors had significantly reduced lung metastases compared
with similar groups of tumor-bearing IL-23p19/ mice not
treated with IL-2 (9). Groups of WT mice injected i.v. with a
high dose of B16F10 tumors (7.5  105 cells) and treated with
a-IL-23 mAb and PBS had a trend toward decreased lung
metastases compared with similar groups of mice treated with
cIg or a-p40 and PBS (P ¼ 0.056; Fig. 3A). Strikingly, there was
a significant decrease in lung metastases in mice that were
treated with a-IL-23 and IL-2 (105 U; P ¼ 0.0079) compared
with similar groups of IL-2–treated mice that were injected
with a-AGP3 or a-p40 (Fig. 3A). The increased therapeutic
effect of combining a-IL-23 mAb and IL-2 immunotherapy
was most obvious when the dose of IL-2 administered was
decreased from 105 to 104 units (Fig. 3B).
Given that a-IL-23 mAb treatment alone resulted in modest
suppression of established B16F10 lung metastases, we next
wanted to assess whether the combination of a-IL-23 mAb and
IL-2 immunotherapy could result in improved therapeutic
efficacy. In addition, we also wanted to determine the optimal
Figure 1. NK-cell–mediated control of B16F10 experimental lung
metastases after anti-IL-23 therapy. A, groups of C57BL/6 WT mice
(n ¼ 5–10) were injected i.v. with 2  105 B16F10 melanoma cells on
day 0. Mice were treated with control Ig (a-AGP3), anti-IL-12p40 (a-p40),
or anti-IL-23 (a-IL-23) mAbs (500 mg i.p.) on day 1 (A and C) or day 7 (A)
relative to tumor inoculation. B, groups of C57BL/6 WT or gene-targeted
mice (n ¼ 5–8) as indicated were injected i.v. with 2  105 B16F10
melanoma cells on day 0. Mice were treated with control Ig (a-AGP3) or
anti-IL-23 (a-IL-23) mAbs (500 mg i.p.) on day 0. C, mice were additionally
depleted of CD8þ T cells (a-CD8) or NK cells (a-ASGM1) by treatment with
antibodies (100 mg i.p.) on days 1, 0, and 7 relative to tumor inoculation.
Fourteen days after tumor inoculation, the lungs of these mice were
harvested and fixed and the colonies were counted and recorded for
individual mice as shown. Asterisks indicate the groups that are
significantly different from PBS treated or cIg-treated mice, using the
Mann–Whitney rank-sum test (*, P < 0.05).

time point for the administration of these two agents (Fig. 4).
Similar to the experiment above, groups of WT mice were
injected i.v. with a high dose of B16F10 tumors on day 0
(Fig. 4A). As expected, treatment with both a-IL-23 mAb
and IL-2 on day 1 prior to tumor inoculation resulted in the
best level of suppression compared with similar groups of mice

that were treated with cIg and IL-2 on day 1 (P ¼ 0.0079;
Fig. 4A). Importantly, combination treatment in groups of mice
also significantly reduced day 7 established B16F10 lung
metastases compared with similar groups of mice that received
either IL-2 or a-IL-23 mAb on day 7 (P ¼ 0.0465). Interestingly,
no decrease in lung metastases was observed in groups of mice
that were first treated with a-IL-23 mAb on day 1 followed by
IL-2 therapy on day 7 or those that were treated with IL-2 on
day 1 followed by a-IL-23 mAb on day 7. We next assessed
whether the order of treatment affected therapeutic efficacy in
WT mice bearing established day 7 B16F10 lung metastases
(Fig. 4B). Generally, IL-2 treatment of tumor-bearing mice in
combination with a-IL-23 mAb therapy administered at the
stated time points could all significantly decrease B16F10 lung
metastases compared with similar groups of mice treated with
a-AGP3 (P ¼ 0.012). However, neutralization of IL-23 with
a-IL-23 mAb on days 5 to 7 followed by IL-2 therapy on day 7
resulted in the optimal decrease in lung metastases (P ¼ 0.016)
compared with those that were treated with IL-2 on day 7 and
a-IL-23 mAb on either day 7 or days 7 to 9. Indeed, the schedule
of a-IL-23 mAb treatment on days 5 to 7 followed by IL-2
therapy on day 7 generally resulted in the best therapeutic
effect as observed in 3 other different experimental lung
metastases models (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Since NK cells control B16F10 lung metastases, we next
sought to determine whether NK cell proportions, numbers,
and cytotoxic function were enhanced in tumor-bearing mice
following a-IL-23 mAb and/or IL-2 treatment in combination
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Analysis of these parameters revealed
that all treatments did not dramatically modulate NK cell
proportions and NK cell numbers in the lungs or spleen other
than a trend toward increased NK cell proportion and number
in the lungs of IL-2–treated mice and a lower proportion of NK
cells in the lungs of a-IL-23 mAb–treated mice (Supplementary
Fig. 2A–D). Not surprisingly, IL-2 dramatically increased the
cytotoxic activity of both lung and spleen mononuclear cells
(MNC; Supplementary Fig. 2E and F). However, more importantly, a-IL-23 mAb significantly increased the cytotoxic activity of lung MNCs, but not spleen MNCs, in mice additionally
treated with cIg (a-AGP3) or IL-2. When correcting for NK cell
proportion, this increase in cytotoxicity is even greater following a-IL-23 mAb treatment. Overall, these data suggested that

following early IL-23 neutralization. A–C, groups of C57BL/6 WT, IL23p19/, or IL-12p40/ mice (n ¼ 5–10/group) were injected
subcutaneously with 1  106 EG7 thymoma cells. A and B, tumor-bearing
WT mice were also treated with control isotype anti-AGP3, anti-IL-12p40,
or anti-IL-23 mAbs (500 mg i.p.) on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21. B,
tumor-bearing WT mice and IL-23p19/ mice were additionally depleted
of CD8þ T cells (a-CD8) or NK cells (a-ASGM1) by treatment with
antibodies (100 mg i.p.) on days 1, 0, 7, and 14 relative to tumor
inoculation. C, tumor-bearing WT mice were treated with control isotype
anti-AGP3, anti-IL-12p40, or anti-IL-23 antibodies (500 mg i.p.) on days 6,
10, and 13. Mice were monitored for tumor growth (calculated by the
product of 2 perpendicular axes), and data are presented as the mean
tumor size (cm2)  SEM. Statistical differences between control Ig treated
mice or anti-IL-23–treated mice or tumor-bearing WT or IL-23p19/ mice
were determined by the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test (*, P < 0.05).

IL-2 and anti-IL-23 prolong the survival of mice from
spontaneous mammary metastases post–primary

Having shown that a-IL-23 mAbs alone can impact on early
experimental lung metastases, we next wanted to determine
the therapeutic efficacy of a-IL-23 mAbs on spontaneous
metastases (Fig. 5). Groups of C57BL/6 mice were injected
in the mammary fat pad with 5  105 EO771 mammary
carcinoma cells. These mice were treated i.p. twice weekly
for 4 weeks with either a-AGP3 or a-IL-23 mAbs. Twenty

days after tumor inoculation, the primary tumors had grown
equivalently (Fig. 5A; mean ¼ 0.70–0.80 cm2 in both groups
of mice) and, in both groups, the primary tumors were
resected. Mice were sacrificed at day 35, and lungs were
harvested and the colonies were counted and recorded for
individual mice as shown in Figure 5B. Clearly, mice that
were treated with a-IL-23 mAbs had significantly lower
number of lung metastases than in a-AGP3–treated group
(P ¼ 0.0015). Next, we wanted to assess the therapeutic
efficacy of combining a-IL-23 mAb and IL-2 therapy on

Figure 5. Anti-IL-23 immunotherapy prolongs the survival of mice from spontaneous metastases post primary tumor resection. Groups of 10 C57BL/6

either control Ig (a-AGP3) or anti-IL-23 (a-IL-23) mAbs (500 mg). A, primary tumor growth was measured for 20 days, and 20 days after tumor inoculation, the
primary tumors (mean ¼ 0.70–0.80 cm2 in both groups of mice) were resected. B, mice were sacrificed at day 35, lungs were harvested, and the colonies were

mammary carcinoma cells, and 28 days later, the primary tumors (mean ¼ 0.70–0.83 cm2 in all groups of mice) were resected and groups of mice were then
treated on days 29, 30, and 31 i.p. with either control Ig (a-AGP3), anti-IL-12p40 (a-p40), or anti-IL-23 (a-IL-23) mAbs (500 mg) or anti-CD137 (100 mg) alone
or in combination with IL-2 (105 U i.p.; day 31). C, mice were additionally depleted of CD4þ T cells (a-CD4), CD8þ T cells (a-CD8), or NK cells (a-ASGM1)

Combination Anti-IL-23 Antibody Immunotherapy

established spontaneous lung metastases (Fig. 5C and D).
Groups of BALB/c WT mice were inoculated in the mammary fat pad with the 4T1.2 mammary carcinoma cell line
and 28 days later, the primary tumors were resected. Treatment of these mice with a-IL-23 mAbs and IL-2 commenced
after resection and resulted in significant survival over
similar groups of mice that were treated with cIg or
a-p40 and IL-2 or a-IL-23 alone (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5C). This
increase in survival was comparable with mice that were
treated with a-CD137 mAb and IL-2. In some experiments,
groups of mice with resected tumors treated with a-IL-23
mAbs and IL-2 were additionally depleted of CD4þ, CD8þ, or
NK cells to determine which immune subsets were involved
in enhancing the survival of these mice (Fig. 5D). Clearly,
both CD8þ and NK cells were required, as depletion of either
subset resulted in a loss of survival after treatment with
a-IL-23 mAb and IL-2. In contrast, CD4þ T-cell depletion did
not affect the efficacy of the combination treatment but, on
the contrary, seemed to further improve survival (P ¼
0.0127). Treatment of groups of mice with a-IL-23 mAbs
alone also resulted in increased survival compared with
those treated with a-AGP3, but this was clearly not as
effective as that achieved by the combination therapy.
IL-23 neutralization in combination with anti-erbB2
treatment
While we have shown that the combination of IL-2 and
a-IL-23 mAb synergizes in a range of tumor metastases
models, the proof of principle that neutralization of IL-23
followed by activation of innate immune cells suggests that
other more commonly used agents that engage NK cells may
also be suitable for use in combination with a-IL-23 mAbs. It
has previously been shown that a-erbB2 mAb alone can
impact on tumor growth and this process was dependent
on antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and NK cells (14, 15).
We therefore assessed the therapeutic efficacy of a-erbB2
(7.16.4; prepared in-house as described in ref. 15) and a-IL-23
mAbs in BALB/c mice bearing day 15 established subcutaneous H2N100 mammary tumors that express oncogenic rat
erbB2 (Fig. 6). While, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with
a-IL-23 mAbs or a-erbB2 resulted in either modest or good
suppression of tumor growth, respectively, compared with
cIg-treated mice, the combination therapy of a-erbB2 and
a-IL-23 mAbs provided significantly improved suppression of
H2N100 tumor growth (Fig. 6A). This combination effect of
a-erbB2 and a-IL-23 mAbs was critically dependent upon
both NK cells and CD8þ T cells (Fig. 6B). Overall, our data
demonstrate the potential of neutralizing IL-23 to further
improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer-targeted agents
that engage the immune system.

Discussion
Tumor immunosuppression remains one of the major
obstacles to many potentially effective cancer therapies and
vaccines. In this study, we have shown that a neutralizing
mouse mAb to IL-23 alone suppressed early experimental
B16F10 melanoma lung metastases and inhibited subcuta-

experimental and spontaneous lung metastases. Notably,
Langowski and colleagues did previously describe the antitumor activity of a different mouse anti-mouse IL-23 antibody
against subcutaneous EP2 mammary cancer cells in mice (8);
however, our work represents the first thorough description of
the therapeutic potential of an a-IL-23 mAb in cancer.
In humans, IL-23p19 mRNA has previously been shown to
be significantly elevated in various human cancers, such as
colon, melanoma, lung, breast, and ovarian (8). More recently,
IL-23 protein levels were found to be significantly elevated in
sera of patients with colorectal (16, 17) and squamous cell
carcinomas (18, 19), as well as in the bone marrow of multiple
myeloma patients (20). In addition to inducing the hallmarks
of chronic inflammation such as metalloproteases, angiogenesis, and macrophage infiltration, IL-23 has also been shown
to reduce antitumor immunosurveillance of CD8þ and NK
cells (8, 9). It is now documented that many tumors are
commonly infiltrated and recognized by T cells (7); however,
these cells are not able to mediate their effector function at the
tumor site due to its immunosuppressive microenvironment
(4, 21). Given that anti-IL-23 mAbs are currently in clinical
trials for the treatment of psoriasis (Clinical Trials Identifier:
NCT01225731), we should soon be able to evaluate the therapeutic potential of neutralizing IL-23 in these patients. Most
interesting will be the long-term impact of treating patients
and their potential development of malignancies, with the
prediction that these patients may be protected against
metastasis and tumor development.
Given that chronic inflammatory diseases have been implicated in the induction of many cancers, a-IL-23 mAb therapy
may be seriously considered for use in a tumor-preventative
setting. For example, people who suffer from inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) or Crohn's disease are at an increased risk
of developing colon cancer (22). The observation that IBD is
associated with increased expression of IL-23 (23, 24) and
polymorphisms within the IL-23R gene locus are linked to
susceptibility to Crohn's disease (25) provides impetus for
treating these patients with anti-IL-23 mAbs. By neutralizing
IL-23, the protumorigenic inflammatory environment in the
patient may resolve, therefore decreasing their chances of
developing cancer. A phase I trial of a-IL-23 mAb will soon
commence for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease,
as in psoriasis patients; it will be interesting to monitor these
patients for malignancies.
While we and others have clearly shown that host IL-23
plays a major role in promoting tumor initiation, growth, and
metastases, it remains unclear as to how exactly IL-23 is
mediating its suppressive effect. IL-23 has generally been
associated with the development and function of Th17 cells,
which is characterized by their ability to produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and TNFa (2, 26).
However, herein and previously (9) our studies have clearly
shown that IL-23 mediated its effects independent of IL-17A in
these tumor models. With the potential availability of mAbs to
neutralize mouse IL-17F, IL-22, and TNFa, the role of these
cytokines can be explored in the future. Some studies have
attempted to understand the role of IL-23 by administration of
the recombinant IL-23 ligand (27). The immunologic and

2084

antitumor effects of IL-23, in gp100 peptide vaccine therapy
of established murine melanoma, were tested and neither
systemic nor local IL-23 alone had any impact on tumor
growth or tumor-specific T-cell numbers. Upon specific vaccination, however, systemic IL-23 greatly increased the relative and absolute numbers of vaccine-induced CD8þ T cells
and enhanced their effector function at the tumor site. From
our studies, it is likely that host IL-23 may be having the
opposite effect, cautioning any conclusions regarding
mechanism of IL-23 based on ligand administration. Studies
in gene-targeted mice presented herein strongly suggest that
anti-IL-23 requires host perforin, IL-12, and IFN-g for full
therapeutic effect, illustrating the opposing roles of host IL23 and IL-12 in these tumor models. In at least 1 tumor model,
a-IL-23 enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity at the site of metastases
(lung), particularly in combination with IL-2, but did not seem
to significantly modulate NK cell proportion or number. Our
ability to further define the mechanism by which a-IL-23
suppresses tumors has been limited by the lack of available
reagents in the mouse for reliably detecting IL-23 and IL-23R
by flow cytometry. Using an IL-23R-GFP (green fluorescent
protein) reporter mouse strain, it has been suggested that
small populations of CD11bþ myeloid cells, CD11cþ dendritic
cells (DC), and gd T cells all constitutively express IL-23R
whereas it was not observed on CD8þ T cells, B cells, or NK
cells (28). However, these observations were only determined
in naive mice and it will now be interesting to assess the
expression of IL-23R on immune leukocytes in tumor-bearing
mice.
Although macrophages and DCs are thought to be the
predominant producers of IL-23 (29), a question remains as
to whether tumors themselves can secrete IL-23. To date,
there have been no convincing studies showing that mouse
tumor cell lines or those derived ex vivo can produce IL-23.
Generally, most studies on IL-23 have used reverse transcriptase PCR as a method to quantitate this cytokine, given the
lack of current reagents that can robustly detect IL-23 protein
levels. Similarly, in humans, there has been a paucity of studies
that have clearly shown that IL-23 can be secreted by human
cancer cells, although the reagents for detecting it are more
robust. Very recently, an interesting study by Kesselring and
colleagues reported that they could detect IL-23 directly in
99% of all ex vivo derived head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors (by flow cytometry), although
the actual staining data were not shown (18). The authors also
reported that they could detect IL-23 in the supernatant of
HNSCC cell lines and freshly derived HNSCC tumors; however,
these data were also not shown. It remains for these findings
to be validated and, if true, other cancer types should also be
assessed for their ability to produce IL-23.
From a therapeutic standpoint, our data support the adjuvant use of a-IL-23 in combination with trastuzumab for the
treatment of trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer. A number
of treatments are being offered to women who are failing
trastuzumab treatment; many of them targeting the HER
family of receptors (30). Yet, in addition to a landmark study
by Clynes and colleagues (31), a recent study by Park and
colleagues has also now shown that the mechanisms of tumor

Combination Anti-IL-23 Antibody Immunotherapy

regression of anti-HER2/neu therapy required the activation
of innate immunity and CD8a cells (14). Thus, there is now a
strong rationale to combine trastuzumab with agents, such as
a-IL-23, that promote T- and NK-cell antitumor immunity.
Similarly, IL-2 has been used in the treatment of malignant
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and some other human
malignancies, with some efficacy but limiting toxic side effects
(32). It is possible the utility of IL-2 might be improved against
metastatic disease at lower doses in combination with a-IL-23
mAbs. IL-23 neutralization may also be considered in combination with certain chemotherapeutic agents such as imatinib
mesylate and anthracyclines that are known to engage innate
and/or adaptive immunity (33). For example, it has been
shown that the therapeutic responses in patients with gastrointestinal sarcoma treated with imatinib mesylate (Glivec)
correlated with the induction of IFN-g production by NK cells
(34). Potentially, combining this chemotherapy with IL-23
neutralization may allow for better activation of NK cells,
although it remains to be determined whether IL-23 is immunosuppressive in this clinical setting. From cancer surveillance
(8, 9) and therapeutic studies herein, it seems that blockade of
IL-23 at the point of tumor initiation is far more effective than
when tumors are established. These observations alone suggest that IL-23 may be important in suppressing the earliest
tumor-specific immune activation while having relatively little
impact on restoring anergic T-cell functions in established
tumors. In this sense, combinations of a-IL-23 with a-PD-L1

or a-CTLA-4 may also be attractive, acting at different points
in the immune response to tumor. Further pursuit of the
mechanism of action of IL-23 in tumors and the therapeutic
potential of this pathway will provide an important additional
armamentarium for cancer treatment.
