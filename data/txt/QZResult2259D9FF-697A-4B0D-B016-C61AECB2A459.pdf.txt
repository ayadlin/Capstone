Abstract
Mammalian sterile 20–like kinase 1 (Mst1) is an ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, and its activation
results in cell apoptosis. Recent studies suggest that Mst1
may function as a tumor suppressor. Here, we reported that
heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), which is thought to protect
cells against cellular stress, has been identified as an
Mst1-interacting protein, in a yeast two-hybrid screen of
human adult prostate cDNA library with a dominantnegative Mst1 (K59R) as bait. The interaction of Mst1 with
Hsp70 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in both
cotransfected HEK293 cells and prostate cancer cells. Hsp70
colocalized with Mst1 in the cytoplasm of LNCaP cells. The
interaction sites with Mst1 consisted of NH2-terminal
ATPase domain in Hsp70, whereas the inhibitory domain
of Mst1 mediates the binding of Hsp70 in Mst1. Overexpression of Hsp70 mediates proteasomal degradation of Mst1
in a Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP)-dependent manner.
Furthermore, the proapoptotic effect of Mst1 was markedly
inhibited by overexpression of Hsp70 or CHIP. Most strikingly,
in response to the treatment of anticancer drug cisplatin,
the induction of Hsp70 expression is higher in the androgenindependent DU145 cells compared with the androgendependent LNCaP cells. The higher levels of Hsp70 induction
and subsequent Mst1 degradation mediate cisplatin resistance
in prostate cancer DU145 cells. Moreover, overexpression of
Mst1 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to cisplatin treatment.
These findings implicate that Mst1, a downstream target of
Hsp70, may be developed as a target for sensitizing hormonerefractory prostate cancers to chemotherapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Mammalian sterile 20–like kinase 1 (Mst1) is a ubiquitously
expressed serine/threonine kinase with a similarity to Ste20, an
upstream activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway in budding yeast (1–3). Mst1 contains an NH2terminal catalytic domain and an autoinhibitory segment followed

by a dimerization domain and a nuclear localization motif at the
noncatalytic, COOH-terminal part (3). In addition, Human Mst1
has two caspase cleavage sites suited between the catalytic and
regulatory domains, which mediate the cleavage of the autoinhibitory domain (3, 4). In response to a variety of apoptotic
stimuli, Mst1 is cleaved by caspases to 34- to 36-kDa NH2-terminal
constitutive active fragment, and this cleavage markedly increases
Mst1 kinase activity and translocates cleaved Mst1 to the nucleus
where it phosphorylates histone H2B on Ser14, resulting in
chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and, ultimately, cell
death by apoptosis (4–6). In addition to caspase cleavage, Mst1
phosphorylation has recently been proposed to contribute to
kinase activation (7, 8). Several phosphorylation sites have now
been identified in Mst1, namely Thr175, Thr177, Thr183, Thr187, Ser327,
and Thr387(7, 9). Of these, Thr183 and Thr187 seem to be essential
for kinase activation (9, 10). Phosphorylation at these sites may be
further amplified by dimerization and eventually leads to caspase
activation, thereby constituting a powerful amplification loop of
apoptotic responses (10).
Recently, the role of Mst1 in cancer cells has begun to
be explored. Recent studies indicate that Mst1 and the related
protein Mst2 may play an important role in regulation of
cell cycle progression as well as in tumor suppression. Based
on its proposed function in apoptosis, Mst1 might function as a
tumor suppressor in human cancers as has been suggested for
its Drosophila homologues. Together with Salvador and
Warts, a Drosophila homologue of Mst1/2, Hippo, has been
shown to promote both proper exit from the cell cycle and
apoptosis during development (11–13). In addition, Mst1 has
been shown to associate with the tumor suppressor RASSF1A,
and this interaction resulted in the full activation of Mst1
during Fas-induced apoptosis and enhanced Mst1-mediated
apoptosis in vivo (10, 14). Recently, the loss of cytoplasmic
Mst1 has been shown to be associated with higher tumor grade
and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients (15), further
suggesting a tumor suppressor role for Mst1 in human colorectal
cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of
the Mst1 activation and its role in chemoresistance in cancer
cells remains largely unknown.
In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a
human prostate library using the dominant-negative form of
Mst1(K59R; DNMst1) as bait to identify novel Mst1-associated
proteins. Subsequently, we report evidence that that heat shock
protein 70 (Hsp70) is a novel mediator of the Mst1 signaling in
prostate cancer cells. Hsp70 directly interacts with and augments
proteasomal degradation of Mst1 via a Hsp70 interacting protein
(CHIP)-dependent mechanism. We also showed that induction of
Hsp70 and subsequent degradation of Mst1 mediate cisplatin
resistance in prostate cancer cells.

Degradation of Mst1 by Hsp70

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 1640 (VWR)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories),
20 units/mL penicillin, and 0.02 mg/mL streptomycin at 37jC under
5% CO2.
Yeast two-hybrid screening. The MATCHMAKER GAL4 yeast twohybrid system 3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was performed, and the
human prostate MATCHMAKER cDNA library was screened using human
dominant-negative Mst1(K59R) as bait as previously described (16). The
screening was performed in AH109 yeast cells according to the protocol
provided by the Clontech Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System. Positive
colonies were subject to multiple rounds of additional selection in the
appropriate medium and h-galactosidase (h-gal) filter assays to verify
specificity.
Plasmid constructs. Plasmids bearing full-length Mst1 and Mst1
mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into pCS2-6XMT vector.
Hsp70 and Hsp70 mutants expression vectors were generated by PCR and
subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). To generate bacterially
expressed Hsp70 and Mst1, the full-length Hsp70 and Mst1 cDNAs were
cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) and pGEX-4T (Novagen) expression vectors,
respectively. All recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia.coli BL21. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced at 30jC
with 1 mmol/L isopropyl-h-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Recombinant
proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid–agarose or glutathione
Sepharose 4B Beads.
Construction of adenoviruses. Adenoviruses harboring Mst1, Hsp70,
and CHIP were made using AdMax (Microbix). Briefly, pBHGloxE1,3Cre,
including the estrone adenoviral genome, was cotransfected with the
pDC shuttle vector containing the gene of interest into Ad293 cells using
Fugene 6 (Roche). Adenovirus bearing LacZ was obtained from Clontech.

The viruses were propagated on Ad293 cells and purified using CsCl2
banding followed by dialysis against 20 mmol/L TBS with 2% glycerol.
Titering was performed on Ad293 cells using Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit
(Clontech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Adenovirus
harboring Mst1-specific siRNA (target sequence, 5¶-AAGTGGACCAGGACGATGAAG-3¶) or Hsp70 siRNA (target sequence, 5¶-GAAGGACGAGTTTGAGCACAA-3¶) was constructed using pSilencer adeno 1.0-CMV System
(Ambion).
Glutathione S-transferase pull-down. Purified recombinant His-tagged
Hsp72 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Mst1 were incubated together
for 2 h at 4jC in solution containing 150 mmol/L NaCl and 50 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5). The beads was extensively washed with 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), and bound proteins were eluted from the beads and analyzed by
SDS-PAGE.
Coimmunoprecipitation of Hsp70 and Mst1 in HEK293 cells and
prostate cancer cells. HEK293T were grown in DMEM (VWR) plus 10% (v/
v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with Mst1 and
Hsp70 cDNAs using FuGENE 6, as described by the manufacture (Roche).
Coimmunoprecipitation of Mst1 and Hsp70 was performed essentially as
described (16). The following antibodies were used for detection and
immunoprecipitation: rabbit polyclonal c-Myc (Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal FLAG M2 (Sigma), mouse monoclonal Hsp70 (Stressgene), and rabbit
polyclonal Mst1 (Abgent). Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Detection
of the peroxidase was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham) reagents.
Confocal immunofluorescent staining. The intracellular colocalization
of Mst1 with Hsp70 was examined using an immunofluorescent staining
procedure as described previously (16). LNCaP cells cultured on chamber
slides were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 3.8% formaldehyde for 10 min,
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed

pMT2-MycDNMst1, or pFLAG-Hsp70 were cotransfected into HEK293 cells. Extracted proteins were precipitated by anti-Flag antibody and then separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE. The transferred membrane was immunoblotted with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-Myc or HRP-conjugated anti-Flag antibody.
B, cell lysates obtained from prostate cancer LNCaP cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Mst1 antibody and then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Transferred
membrane was immunoblotted with either anti-Mst1 or Hsp70 antibody. C, recombinant Hsp70 incubated with either GST or GST-Mst1, and proteins were precipitated
with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The precipitated proteins were separated through SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was done with anti-Hsp70 monoclonal
antibody. D, fixed LNCaP cells were stained with anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-Mst1 antibody and processed for confocal imaging.
The merged image shows clear colocalization of these two proteins in cytoplasm.

twice with PBS, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and
subsequently incubated with Mst1 polyclonal antibody and Hsp70
monoclonal antibody at 4jC overnight. Cells were washed five times with
PBS and incubated with appropriate fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies at RT for 1 h. Images were visualized using an Olympus IX70
epifluorescence microscope.
In-gel kinase assay. 293T cells were transiently transfected with
Myc-DNMst1, Myc-Mst1, and Flag-Hsp70 cDNAs. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were lysed in the buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5%
Triton X-100. Cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000  g
for 10 min at 4jC. The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated
with anti-Myc for 2 h at 4jC. Equal amounts of precipitated Mst1 were
incubated for 20 min at 30jC with 5 Ag myelin basic protein (MBP) in
25 AL kinase buffer 40 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L MgCl2,
1 mmol/L DTT, and 1 ACi [g-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the
addition of 2  SDS sample buffer. For in vitro kinase assay, purified Mst1
(Upstate) was incubated with increasing concentration of Hsp70 for 2 h at
4jC and then incubated with 5 Ag MBP in 25 AL kinase assay buffer for
20 min at 30jC. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2  SDS
sample buffer, and then loaded to 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to
autoradiography.
Analysis of DNA fragmentation by ELISA. Histone-associated DNA
fragments were quantitated by the Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche;
ref. 17). Briefly, the cytoplasmic fractions were added to the 96-well ELISA
plates precoated with the antihistone monoclonal antibody and incubated
for 90 min at room temperature. After washing, bound nucleosomes were
detected by the addition of anti–DNA-peroxidase monoclonal antibody and
reacted for 60 min at room temperature. After the addition of substrate,
absorbance was read with an ELISA reader at 405 nm.

Results
Association of Hsp70 with Mst1. Although Mst1 activation has
been implicated in cell apoptosis in response to a wide range of
stimuli (18), the mechanism mediating the regulation of Mst1
activation, however, is not completely elucidated. To better define
its function and to identify additional binding partners, we used
DNMst1 (K59R) as bait in a two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library
from human prostate. h-gal–based screening identified several
positive clones, and sequencing of cDNA identified one of the
positive clones as Hsp70 fragment in-frame to the GAL4 activation
domain.
To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, we examined the
interaction between Hsp70 and Mst1 in cells. 293T cells were
cotransfected with vectors that expressed Myc-tagged Mst1 and
Flag-tagged Hsp70. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged Hsp70 led
to coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Mst1 or Myc-tagged
DNMst1 when both proteins were cotransfected (Fig. 1A). As a
control, the anti-FLAG antibody did not immunoprecipitate Myctagged Mst1 or Myc-tagged DNMst1 in the absence of Flag-Hsp70
(Fig. 1A). To determine whether there is an interaction of
endogenous Hsp70 and Mst1 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-Mst1 antibody using lysates obtained from
prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Hsp70 coprecipitated with the

anti-Mst1 antibody but not with the nonimmune IgG control
(Fig. 1B). These findings indicate that endogenous levels of Mst1
can interact with Hsp70 in prostate cancer cells.
To show a direct protein interaction between Mst1 and hsp70,
GST Pull-down was performed using bacterially expressed GST
fused to full-length Mst1. Sepharose-conjugated GST-Mst1 or GST
alone was incubated with purified His-Hsp70, and unbound and
bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.
Hsp70 bound to GST-Mst1 but not GST alone, confirming a direct
protein interaction (Fig. 1C). To determine the intracellular
localization of this interaction, we performed immunofluorescence
staining in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Immunofluorescent
microscopy showed that Hsp70 and Mst1 are colocalized in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 1D).
Interaction domains of Hsp70 and Mst1. To further map the
interaction domains of Hsp70 and Mst1, we performed immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells cotransfected with different deletion
mutants of Mst1 and Hsp70. We first investigated the binding
domains of Hsp70 in Mst1. Mst1 contains NH2-terminal kinase
domain followed by inhibitory domain and COOH-terminal
dimerization domain (Fig. 2A; ref. 3). We generated a series of
Mst1 deletion mutants subcloned into pCS26MT vector with 6
Myc tag and transfected these mutants into HEK293 cells along
with Flag-Hsp70. Lysates from transfected HEK293 cells were
immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and analyzed by
Western blot analysis using anti-Flag and anti-Myc antibodies.
We found that Flag-Hsp70 bound to Mst1 mutant bearing inhibitory and dimerization domains. Further deletion of Mst1
inhibitory domain totally abolished the interaction of Hsp70 with
Mst1 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the inhibitory domain of Mst1 is
necessary for interaction with Hsp70.

Hsp70 contains two functional domains, namely, NH2-terminal
ATPase domain and COOH-terminal substrate–binding domain
(Fig. 2C; ref. 19). To map the Mst1-binding domain in Hsp70, Flagtagged Mst1 mutants were cotransfected into HEK293 cells with
Myc-tagged Hsp70. Lysates from transfected HEK293 cells were
immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and analyzed by
Western blotting analysis using anti-Flag and anti–Myc-antibodies.
As shown in Fig. 2D, Mst1 interacted only with Hsp70 NH2-terminal
ATPase domain but not with COOH-terminal substrate–binding
domain. Together, these results further suggest that Hsp70 NH2terminal ATPase domain mediates its interaction with Mst1.
Hsp70 mediates degradation of Mst1. To determine whether
the interaction of Hsp70 with Mst1 has functional consequences in
terms of affecting Mst1 activity, we cotransfected Mst1 and Hsp70
into HEK293 cells and determined Mst1 expression and kinase
activity. Transfection of Hsp70 markedly decreased both phosphorylation of substrate MBP and autophosphorylation of Mst1
by f60%, as determined by an in vitro kinase assay, using MBP as
a substrate (Fig. 3A). In addition, transfection of Hsp70 also
substantially attenuated Mst1 expression by f50% (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, to determine whether Hsp70 directly targets Mst1,
the effect of Hsp70 on Mst1 activity, in vitro, was examined. In
contrast, in an in vitro kinase assay system, incubation of
recombinant bioactive Mst1 with increased concentration of
recombinant Hsp70 had no significant effects on Mst1 kinase
activity (Fig. 3B). In addition, Hsp70 was not phosphorylated by
Mst1, suggesting that Hsp70 is not a substrate of Mst1 (data not
shown). Moreover, transfection of Hsp70 markedly down-regulated
Mst1 expression in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells
(Fig. 3C). To determine whether Mst1 could serve as a substrate of
the proteasomal degradation machinery, which is linked to the

were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and inmmunoprecipitates were subjected to in gel kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. B, recombinant Mst1
was preincubated with increasing amounts of Hsp70 and then subjected to in vitro kinase assay. C, Myc-Mst1 expression vector in combination of either empty vector
or increasing concentration of Flag-Hsp70 plasmids were cotransfected into HEK293 cells. The expression of Mst1 and Hsp70 were detected by Western blotting
analysis. D, 293 cells were transfected with Myc-Mst1 expression plasmid together with either empty vector or Hsp70 expression vector. At 48 h after transfection, cells
were left untreated or were treated with 10 Amol/L lactacystin for 3 h. Cells were lysed and processed for immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. As a control for protein
loading, immunoblots (IB ) were probed in parallel with an antitubulin antibody.

experiments. *, P < 0.05 versus AdHsp70 or AdCHIP.

heat shock protein network (20), the effect of Hsp70 ovexpression
on Mst1 down-regulation was examined in the presence and
absence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. As shown in
Fig. 3D, lactacystin treatment substantially suppresses the disappearance of Mst1 in Hsp70-transfected cells, thereby suggesting
that the 26 S proteasome might be responsible for the downregulation of Mst1 in response to Hsp70 overexpression.
CHIP is required for Hsp70-mediated degradation of Mst1.
Previous studies suggest that the cochaperone CHIP, an E3
ubiquitin ligase of the U-box protein family, is involved in the
Hsp70-mediated proteasomal degradation (21, 22). To investigate
whether CHIP is required for Hsp70-mediated degradation of
Mst1, we first examined by coimmunoprecipitation assay whether
Mst1 associates with CHIP in cotransfected HEK293 cells. As
shown in Fig. 4A, immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged CHIP led to
coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Mst1 when both proteins
were cotransfected. As a control, the anti-Flag antibody did not
immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged Mst1 in the absence of Flag-CHIP.
These studies showed that CHIP is present in immunoprecipitates
of Mst1. Furthermore, the expression of Mst1 was markedly
attenuated by cotransfection of CHIP in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B). To
further confirm a role for CHIP in Hsp70-mediated degradation of
Mst1, we used a mutant form of CHIP lacking ubiquitin ligase

activity (Myc-CHIPE4; ref. 20). As expected from the above data,
expression of Hsp70 greatly reduced the steady-state levels of Mst1
in transfected cells. However, inhibition of endogenous CHIP
activity by overexpression of its U-box mutant almost completely
antagonizes the effects of Hsp70 on Mst1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
Hsp70 induces Mst1 degradation in a CHIP-dependent manner.
Because Mst1 has been characterized to induce cell apoptosis (18),
we investigated whether Hsp70 and CHIP can affect apoptosis via
inhibitory effects on Mst1 in prostate cancer cells. Indeed,
transduction of LNCaP cells with AdMst1 [multiplicity of infection
(MOI), 30] significantly induced cell apoptosis, as determined by
the extent of DNA fragmentation. The proapoptotic effect of Mst1,
however, was markedly attenuated by overexpression of either
Hsp70 or cochaperone CHIP. In addition, Mst1-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) was also inhibited by overexpression of Hsp70 in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these
findings suggest that the interaction of Hsp70 with Mst1 may be
functionally important in terms of regulating Mst1-mediated cell
apoptosis.
The Hsp70-Mst1 axis mediates cisplatin resistance in
prostate cancer cells. To substantiate the functional significance
of the Hsp70-Mst1 interaction in vivo, we investigated the role of
the Hsp70-Mst1 interaction in cancer cell apoptosis and survival.

Degradation of Mst1 by Hsp70

To this end, two types of prostate cancer cell lines, including DU145
and LNCaP cells, were used. Cells were treated with increasing
concentration of anticancer drug cisplatin, and the expression of
Hsp70 and Mst1 was then detected by Western blotting analysis. As
shown in Fig. 5A and B, treatment of human prostate cancer cells
with cisplatin markedly increased the expression of Hsp70.
Accordingly, the expression of Mst1 was substantially inhibited.
The inhibition of Mst1 expression was not attributable to the
caspase-mediated cleavage, as observed in previous studies (4–6),
because the 34-kDa NH2-terminal fragment was not detected in our
experiments (data not shown). Most strikingly, the pattern of
Hsp70 induction by cisplatin is different in androgen-independent
DU145 cells versus androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Three micromoles per liter of cisplatin markedly induced Hsp70 expression by
2-fold and inhibited Mst1 expression by f50% in the androgenindependent DU145 cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in androgendependent LNCaP cells, cisplatin, at the same concentration, had
no effect on both Hsp70 and Mst1 expression (Fig. 5B). At the

concentration of 24 Amol/L, cisplatin robustly induced Hsp70
expression by f10-fold in DU145 cells, compared with 2.5-fold
induction in LNCaP cells, although the expression of Mst1 was
markedly inhibited in both cell lines (Fig. 5A and B). Given that
Hsp70 plays an important role in mediating chemoresistance in a
variety of cancer cells, we hypothesized that the androgenindependent DU145 cells may be more resistant to anticancer
drugs, such as cisplatin, in addition to their resistance to androgen
ablation treatment. To test this hypothesis, we compared the
apoptosis induced by cisplatin between DU145 and LNCaP cells.
As shown in Fig. 5C, the two cell lines displayed different cisplatin
sensitivities. LNCaP cells were more sensitive to the apoptosis
induced by cisplatin compared with DU145 cells.
To test whether Mst1 plays a similar role as Hsp70 in mediating
chemosensitivity in prostate cancer cells, the expression of Mst1
was knockdowned by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of
Mst1-specific siRNA in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 5D,
knockdown of Mst1 expression by siRNA significantly decreased

increasing concentration of cisplatin as indicated. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were lysed and processed for immunoblotting with anti-Mst1, anti-Hsp70,
or anti–a-tubulin antibodies. The expression levels of Mst1 and Hsp70 were quantitated by densitometry. B, prostate cancer LNCaP cells were treated with increasing

the sensitivity of LNCaP cells to the cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
In contrast, knockdown of Hsp70 by siRNA prevented Mst1 degradation by cisplatin and sensitized cisplatin-induced apoptosis in
DU145 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Together, these results suggest
that the Hsp70-Mst1 axis might be involved in the resistance of
human prostate cancer to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Overexpression of Mst1 sensitizes cisplatin-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To further clarify the role of Mst1
in chemosensitivity in prostate cancer cells, we examined the
effects of overexpression of Mst1 on cell apoptosis. As shown in
Fig. 6A, infection with AdMst1 dose-dependently increased
expression of both uncleaved and cleaved Mst1 in both DU145
and LNCaP cells. In addition, AdMst1 dose-dependently induced
the phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 6A), suggesting that JNK was
activated downstream from Mst1. Furthermore, overexpression of
Mst1 dose-dependently induced cell apoptosis in both prostate
cancer cells, as determined by Cell Death ELISA (Fig. 6B). However,
the magnitude of the apoptotic effect of Mst1 overexpression in
LNCaP cells is higher than that in DU145 cells. Importantly, in
combination with cisplatin, AdMst1 synergistically augmented
the apoptotic effects of cisplatin in DU145 cells, whereas
cotransduction of AdHsp70 substantially inhibited Mst1-induced
synergistic effects (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, Lactacystin, which
prevents degradation of Mst1 by Hsp70 (Fig. 3D), also potentiated
the cisplatin-induced apoptotic effect in DU145 cells (Fig. 6D).
Together, these results suggest that the activation of Mst1 may

represent an important therapeutic strategy for improving
chemotherapeutic efficacy in prostate cancer patients.

Discussion
Hormone-refractory prostate cancers have long been considered
a chemoresistant disease. In this study, we found that in response
to the treatment of anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin, the
induction of Hsp70 expression is higher in the androgenindependent DU145 cells compared with the androgen-dependent
LNCaP cells. The higher level of Hsp70 seems to cause a proteasomal degradation of Mst1, a proapoptotic kinase and a potential
tumor suppressor, via a CHIP-dependent mechanism. Overexpression of Mst1 sensitized these cells to drug treatment. These
findings implicate that Mst1, a downstream target of Hsp70, may
be developed as a target for sensitizing hormone-refractory
prostate cancers to chemotherapy.
It is well-documented that Hsp70, when induced in the cellular
response to cytotoxic stress, prevents cell death triggered by a
variety of apoptotic stimuli, including heat shock, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF), growth factor withdrawal, oxidative stress, chemotherapeutic agents, ceramide, and ionizing radiation (23). Several
different mechanisms have been proposed to account for the
cytoprotective activity of Hsp70. Hsp70 has been shown to downregulate the caspase, JNK, p38 MAPK, and apoptosis signalregulating kinase signaling cascades (23, 24). Moreover, by

associating with Apaf-1, Hsp70 blocks Apaf-1/cytochrome c–
mediated caspase activation (25, 26). Hsp70 also binds to and
antagonizes apoptosis-inducing factor, thereby inhibiting caspaseindependent apoptosis (27). Recently, accumulating evidence
suggests that Mst1 plays a central role in the initiation of cell
apoptosis. Indeed, in response to various proapoptotic stimuli and
cellular stresses, including TNF-a (28), serum starvation (29),
staurosporine (28), anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (30, 31), UV
irradiation (28), retinoic acid (28), okadaic acid (32, 33), as well as
anticancer drugs (32, 34, 35), Mst1 has been shown to be activated
in a wide range of cell lines. The broad nature of the stimuli and
the range of the cell systems in which Mst1 is activated suggest
that this enzyme may be a common component in the diverse
signaling pathways leading to apoptosis. In the present study, our
data indicate that Hsp70 may exert cytoprotective effects by
directly interacting with and neutralizing Mst1. Given that Mst1 is
a MAP4K that contributes to both the JNK and p38 MAPK
signaling cascades (7), inhibition of Mst1 by Hsp70 may also be an
important mechanism by which Hsp70 inhibits the JNK signaling
pathway (34).
Previous studies have indicated that Hsp70 plays essential roles
in oncogenesis and in resistance to chemotherapy. Hsp70 overexpression in cancer cells increases their tumorigenicity in rodent
models (36, 37). High Hsp70 expression, as observed in most cancer
cells, has been associated with metastasis, poor prognosis, and
resistance to chemotherapy or radiation therapy (38–41). Furthermore, Hsp70 antisense constructs have been reported to chemosensitize and even kill cancer cell lines in the absence of additional
stimuli (42). The cytotoxic effect of Hsp70 down-modulation is
particularly strong in transformed cells yet undetectable in normal,
nontransformed cell lines or primary cells (42). Thus, Hsp70 seems
as an interesting molecular target for sensitizing tumor cell to
cancer therapy. However, to date, there are no small molecules
currently available to selectively inhibit Hsp70. Thus, the identifi-

cation of Mst1 as a downstream target of Hsp70 is crucial because
Mst1 has been shown to be activated by a variety of chemical and
biological agents in a number of cell lines (18). Therefore, it is
tempting to speculate that similar agents might be used alone or in
combination with other molecules to overcome chemoresistance
in cancer cells that overexpress higher levels of Hsp70 protein. This
hypothesis is subject to ongoing investigation.
Recently, it has been suggested that Mst1 might function as a
tumor suppressor in human cancers as has been suggested for its
Drosophila homologues. Together with Salvador, the Drosophila
homologue of hWW45, and Warts, the Drosophila homologue of
large tumor suppressor (LATS), Hippo, the Drosophila homologue
of Mst1/2, has been shown to promote apoptosis and proper
termination of cell proliferation during development (11, 12, 43).
Although mutations in the hWW45 gene have been reported in
cancer cell lines (44), its function has not been elucidated in detail.
The roles of hWW45 or LATS in resistance to chemotherapy and
the relationship between Hsp70, Mst1, and hWW45 or LATS in
cancer cells, especially in prostate cancer cells, require further
investigation.
In conclusion, the data reported here represent the first
demonstration that Mst1 is an intracellular target of Hsp70, and
that induction of Hsp70 and subsequent inhibition of Mst1
activation may constitute an important mechanism by which
Hsp70 mediates the responses of tumor cells toward chemotherapy. Thus, activation of Mst1 may represent a new approach to
enhance the clinical efficacy of prostate cancer chemotherapy.
