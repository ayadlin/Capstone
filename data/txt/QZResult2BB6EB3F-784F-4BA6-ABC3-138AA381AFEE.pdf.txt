ABSTRACT
Recent findings have revealed that dysregulated miRNAs contribute significantly
to autophagy and chemoresistance. Pharmacologically targeting autophagy-related
miRNAs is a novel strategy to reverse drug resistance. Here, we report a novel
function of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) as a natural inhibitor of autophagy-related miR25 in killing drug-resistant breast cancer cells. ISL induced chemosensitization,
cell cycle arrest and autophagy, but not apoptosis, in MCF-7/ADR cells. ISL also
promoted the degradation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCG2
primarily via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. More importantly, miRNA 3.0 array
experiments identified miR-25 as the main target of ISL in triggering autophagy
flux. A mechanistic study validated that miR-25 inhibition led to autophagic cell
death by directly increasing ULK1 expression, an early regulator in the autophagy
induction phase. miR-25 overexpression was demonstrated to block ISL-induced
autophagy and chemosensitization. Subsequent in vivo experiments showed that
ISL had chemosensitizing potency, as revealed by an increase in LC3-II staining, the
downregulation of ABCG2, a reduction in miR-25 expression and the activation of the
miR-25 target ULK1. Overall, our results not only indicate that ISL acts as a natural
autophagy inducer to increase breast cancer chemosensitivity, but also reveal that
miR-25 functions as a novel regulator of autophagy by targeting ULK1.

INTRODUCTION

experience a recurrence, of which 10–20% are local
and 60–70% are distant metastases [2]. Drug resistance
is considered a major factor influencing breast cancer
clinical outcomes. However, current progress in finding a
potent, selective agent to overcome cancer drug resistance
has been slow and challenging [3]. How to effectively
promote breast cancer chemosensitivity has become an
urgent issue worldwide.
The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
and the second leading cause of cancer death in women
worldwide. With the development of multidisciplinary
treatments, the 5-year survival rate of breast cancer
has greatly been improved. However, there are still

transporters is highly correlated with drug resistance
[4]. However, ABC-targeting strategies have not been as
effective as expected due to the involvement of various
other mechanisms, such as alterations in drug metabolism,
mutations in drug targets and changes in the tumor
microenvironment [5]. More recently, autophagy induction
has emerged as a novel strategy to overcome drug
resistance during cancer therapy [6]. Meschini et al. found
that the natural compound vocamine led to autophagic cell
death in doxorubicin-resistant osteosarcoma cells, which
was accompanied by a decrease in ABCB1 expression
[7]. Another study reported that autophagy induction in
apoptosis-deficient H460 lung cancer cells resulted in
an enhanced efficacy of radiation therapy in vitro and in
vivo [8]. Furthermore, it was found that the constitutive
expression of ABCB1 in hepatocellular cancer cells
was positively linked to the overexpression of Bcl2 and
mTOR, rendering these cells resistant to autophagy [9].
However, enhanced autophagy was usually observed
in advanced stages of tumorigenesis, and some studies
have claimed that autophagy inhibition increased cancer
chemosensitivity to cytotoxic drugs [10-14]. Therefore,
autophagy can be considered a double-edged sword
in cancer development, and autophagy modulation
has become a novel strategy to overcome cancer drug
resistance.
In the past decade, genetic screens in yeast have
identified a large family of core autophagy-related genes
(ATG), such as Atg1, Atg4, LC3/Atg8 and BECN1
[15]. There are additional contributions to autophagy
regulation by a variety of upstream signaling pathways,
including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways
[16]. Recently, a group of endogenous noncoding
miRNAs have been thoroughly investigated in autophagy
modulation [17]. miRNAs are endogenous ~22 nucleotide
RNAs that suppress gene expression via messenger RNA
(mRNA) cleavage and/or translational repression. There
is accumulating evidence that miRNAs play critical
roles in a broad range of biological processes, including
proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and stress
response, linking them to a variety of human diseases,
including cancer [18, 19]. Because a single miRNA
can simultaneously regulate a multitude of targets and
biological networks, increasing attention is being focused
on developing miRNA-based strategies for cancer
therapy. A series of miRNAs have been implicated in
cancer patient survival and the modification of anticancer
strategies. However, discoveries about the roles of
miRNAs in mediating autophagy and drug resistance
are currently limited. At present, only a small subset of
miRNAs, including miR-30a, miR-23b and miR-199a-5p,
have been confirmed to regulate cancer chemosensitivity
via autophagy-related processes [20, 21]. Nonetheless, it
is worthwhile to develop pharmacological agents targeting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these dysregulated miRNAs to restore drug sensitivity
[22].
Candidate drugs for reversing drug resistance should
ideally be selective, potent and relatively nontoxic [3].
Because natural extracts are usually low in toxicity and
are well-tolerated in the human body, increasing attention
has been paid to discovering chemosensitizing agents
from natural sources. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a natural
flavonoid isolated from the root of licorice (Glycyrrhiza
uralensis), which is commonly used for culinary purposes
in Western countries but as a medicinal herb in China.
Previous research has demonstrated that ISL possesses
various biologic properties, such as anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidant, anti-platelet aggregation, vasorelaxant
and estrogenic effects [23]. A number of studies have
reported significant antitumor activities of ISL, including
apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, migration inhibition
and oxidative stress triggering [24-28]. Some studies
have indicated that ISL mediates chemopreventive
activities, including suppressing 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]
anthracene (DMBA)-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis
and inhibiting carcinogen-induced lesion formation in
a mouse mammary organ culture assay [29, 30]. Very
recently, we demonstrated that ISL inhibited breast cancer
neoangiogenesis by specifically docking into the ATP
domain of VEGFR-2 kinase [31]. These findings suggest
that ISL is a multifunctional compound with anticancer
properties. However, there has been little research into the
chemosensitizing effects of ISL and its association with
autophagy and miRNAs.
In the present study, we revealed a novel activity
for ISL as a potent autophagy inducer to chemosensitize
drug-resistant breast cancer cells. We showed that ISL
induced proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest and
autophagy, but not apoptosis, in drug-resistant breast
cancer cells. ISL was found to promote the influx
of chemotherapeutic agents by promoting ABCG2
degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway.
An miRNA 3.0 array analysis and a functional study
further revealed that miR-25 is the primary target of ISL
and a novel autophagy-related miRNA. A mechanistic
study validated that miR-25 inhibition led to autophagic
cell death by directly increasing the expression of ULK1,
an early regulator in the autophagy induction phase.
Notably, ISL-induced autophagy was demonstrated to be
dependent on the function of miR-25 in both in vitro and
in vivo assays. Our study not only demonstrated that ISL
is a natural autophagy inducer to increase breast cancer
chemosensitivity but also elucidated the role of miR-25
as a novel regulator of autophagy modulation by targeting
ULK1.

effects of epirubicin, indicating that ISL may be a safe
chemosensitizing agent (Figure 1B).
To determine the long-term inhibitory effects of ISL
on the proliferation of MCF-7/ADR cells, we performed a
colony formation assay. The results showed that ISL alone
dose-dependently inhibited the colony growth of MCF-7/
ADR and significantly limited the colony number when
combined with epirubicin (Figure 1C). The intracellular
concentration of epirubicin was also greatly elevated in
ISL-treated cancer cells, as revealed using fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 1D) and flow cytometry (Figure
1E). These results indicated that ISL inhibited the drugresistant property of MCF-7/ADR cells and promoted
epirubicin influx.

ISL chemosensitizes drug-resistant breast cancer
cells
To determine whether ISL had chemosensitizing
effects on drug-resistant breast
cancer cells, we tested the synergistic effects of
ISL and the chemotherapeutic drug epirubicin, which is
usually administered as the first-line chemotherapy for
breast cancer. As shown in Figure 1A, epirubicin induced
limited proliferation inhibition in drug-resistant breast
cancer MCF-7/ADR cells compared with its effects on
MCF-7 cells. However, ISL had significant inhibitory
effects on the proliferation of MCF-7/ADR cells and
interacted synergistically with epirubicin to induce cell
death. In contrast, ISL had limited inhibitory effects on
the proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial
MCF-10A cells and did not increase the cytotoxic

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the
ability of ISL to chemosensitize MCF-7/ADR cells,

combination with epirubicin) significantly inhibited the colony-forming ability of MCF-7/ADR cells (the values represent the means ± SD,

revealed that ISL promoted the influx of epirubicin into MCF-7/ADR cells.

we first examined the potential influence of ISL on cell
cycle progression. The results showed that ISL alone
dose-dependently arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M
checkpoint. Additionally, when cells were treated with a
combination of ISL and epirubicin, the G2/M population
increased to 36.22% after 24 h, which was significantly
higher than the G2/M proportion of 31.64% in the cells
treated with ISL alone (Figure 2A). These results revealed
that ISL interacted synergistically with epirubicin to
inhibit cell mitosis. We then investigated whether ISL
could induce apoptosis in drug-resistant breast cancer
cells. A flow cytometry assay revealed the presence of few
Annexin V-positive cells following ISL addition compared
with the positive control, camptothecin. A western blotting
assay also indicated that ISL had minimal effects on
apoptosis markers, including cleaved PARP (poly ADPribose polymerase), caspase-6, caspase-7 and caspase-9.
However, the protein expression of Bcl-2 was greatly
downregulated after ISL treatment (Figure 2B). Because
Bcl-2 is reported to be an important regulator of autophagy
by binding to BECN1 [32], we examined whether ISL
could trigger autophagy in MCF-7/ADR cells.

As shown in Figure 2C, ISL treatment led to a
significant dose-dependent increase in the autophagy
activity of ADR cells, indicated by increased fluorescent
intensity of GFP-LC3-II puncta. Acridine orange
(AO) staining revealed that after ISL treatment, the
intracellular formation of acidic vesicular organelles
(AVOs) was greatly increased, indicating enhanced
activity of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Western
blotting results showed that ISL significantly increased
the expression of LC3-II, which was accompanied by the
upregulation of BECN1 and downregulation of p-mTOR
and ABCG2 (Figure 2D). To confirm the autophagyinducing effects of ISL, we transfected MCF-7/ADR cells
with siRNA targeting Atg5, a critical protein responsible
for autophagosome formation [33]. As shown in Figure
2E, Atg5 siRNA significantly blocked the increases in
GFP-LC3-II puncta and AVO formation induced by
ISL treatment. The ISL-induced upregulation of LC3II was also inhibited by Atg5 siRNA, further validating
the autophagy-inducing effects of ISL (Figure 2F).
Taken together, these results revealed that ISL triggered
the intracellular autophagy, which was accompanied

ISL activated autophagy flux in ADR cells, indicated by increased levels of LC3-II and BECN1, decreased expression of p-mTOR and
inhibited expression of ABCG2; (E) the autophagy-inducing effect of ISL was blocked by Atg5 siRNA, as indicated by decreased LC3-II
puncta; (F) western blotting revealed that Atg5 siRNA treatment inhibited the ISL-induced increase in LC3-II expression.

by the downregulation of ABCG2. Because ABCG2 is
the primary membrane transporter responsible for drug
resistance in breast cancer, our findings implied that
the chemosensitizing effects of ISL might be closely
correlated with ABCG2 reduction via the autophagy
pathway.

that ISL further induced LC3-II upregulation following
CQ treatment (Figure 3B). ISL-induced autophagy was
abolished by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
(3-MA). The addition of 3-MA led to the inhibition of
both ISL-induced AVO formation and the upregulation of
LC3-II and BECN1 (Figure 3A, B). Because 3-MA is well
known as an autophagy inhibitor targeting the upstream
PI3K signaling pathway [34], the results indicated that ISL
functioned by inducing the early stage of autophagy flux
rather than by inhibiting lysosome degradation.
Because the mature oligomeric ABCG2 is reported
to be degraded primarily via the lysosome pathway [35],
we therefore investigated whether the downregulation of
ABCG2 induced by ISL was due to autophagy induction.
We performed a time point-based fluorescence detection
of AVOs and LC3-II and ABCG2 expression. The results
showed that after ISL treatment for 2 h, MCF-7/ADR
cells exhibited significantly elevated numbers of AVOs,
which was accompanied by increased expression of LC3-

ISL induces ABCG2 degradation via the
autophagy-lysosome pathway
To confirm that the enhancement of autophagy
markers by ISL was due to the induction of autophagy
rather than the blockage of autophagosome maturation,
the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was added
to the culture medium along with ISL. Both the LC3-II
level and AVO formation in the cotreatment group were
significantly higher than in the group treated with CQ
alone (Figure 3A). Western blotting results demonstrated

Figure 3: ISL inhibits ABCG2 expression via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. (A–B) Treatment with the autophagy

inhibitor 3-MA abolished the autophagy-inducing effects of ISL after 24 h of treatment, indicated by decreases in LC3-II expression
and AVO formation, whereas adding the lysosome inhibitor CQ enhanced LC3-II accumulation and AVO formation in ADR cells after
24 h, indicating that the ISL-induced enhancement of autophagy markers was due to autophagy induction rather than the inhibition of
autophagosome maturation; these results were further validated by a western blotting analysis; (C–D) time point-based immunofluorescence
detection was performed to examine the correlation between autophagy induction and ABCG2 inhibition. The results showed that AVO
formation and LC3-II accumulation occurred as early as 2 h after ISL treatment, whereas decreased ABCG2 expression was observed at the
5th hour, indicating that autophagy induction occurred prior to the downregulation of the drug resistance marker ABCG2; the results were
validated by western blotting; (E–F) 24 h of treatment with the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and CQ restored the cell viability and ABCG2
expression inhibited by ISL, indicating that ISL may induce cell death primarily by the autophagy pathway (the values represent the means
± SD, n=3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01).

II. However, the fluorescence intensity of ABCG2 was
inhibited until the 5th hour after ISL treatment, indicating
that autophagy induction by ISL occurred prior to ABCG2
downregulation (Figure 3C). The expression level of
ABCG2 also began to decrease at the 5th hour, indicating
that the autophagy-lysosome pathway may be the main

mechanism underlying the ABCG2 reduction induced by
ISL (Figure 3D).
To determine whether autophagy inhibition would
reduce the death-inducing effects of ISL on drug-resistant
breast cancer cells, we added 3-MA or CQ along with
ISL to MCF-7/ADR cells and assessed cell proliferation.

Figure 4: Identification of miR-25 as a novel regulator of ISL-induced autophagy, which functions by targeting ULK1.
(A) An miRNA 3.0 array was used to detect miRNA expression differences between 3-MA-treated MCF-7/ADR cells, untreated MCF7/ADR cells and ADR cells treated with ISL for 24 h. As a result, miR-210, miR-25, miR-30b and miR-4458 were found to exhibit
expression patterns that were correlated with autophagy activity; (B) a qPCR analysis validated miR-25 as the primary regulator of
autophagy, indicated by its gradually decreased expression in 3-MA-treated MCF-7/ADR, MCF-7/ADR and ISL-treated ADR cells (the
values represent the means ± SD, n=3, **P<0.01); (C) miR-25 inhibitors were transfected into MCF-7/ADR cells. After 24 h, increases in
GFP-LC3-II accumulation was observed, confirming that miR-25 independently induced autophagy flux; (D) miR-25 inhibitor treatment
for 24 h resulted in decreased cell proliferation and significantly increased chemosensitivity to epirubicin, indicating that miR-25 may also
be strongly connected to cancer chemosensitivity (the values represent the means ± SD, n=6,** P<0.01 vs. normal controls); (E–F) qPCR
and western blotting results validated that miR-25 inhibition led to an increase in ULK1 but not in ATG-14, indicating that the direct target
of miR-25 could be ULK1 (the values represent the means ± SD, n=3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01); (H) a luciferase reporter gene assay further
confirmed that ULK1 transcription was inhibited by miR-25 treatment but enhanced by miR-25 inhibitors. However, when the predicted
binding sites of miR-25 in the 3’UTR region of ULK1 were mutated, miR-25 mimics and inhibitors had little influence on the transcription
of ULK1, indicating that miR-25 binds directly to the predicted sites in the 3’UTR region of ULK1 (the values represent the means ± SD,
n=3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01).

The results showed that 3-MA and CQ inhibited the
proliferation of MCF-7/ADR cells to a limited extent.
However, the cancer cell death induced by ISL was
reduced to some degree by both 3-MA and CQ (Figure 3E).
ISL also arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M checkpoint,
an important factor in proliferation, which may explain
why 3-MA and CQ could not fully abolish the inhibitory
effects of ISL on proliferation. A western blotting assay
revealed that 3-MA or CQ addition restored the ABCG2
expression that was downregulated by ISL (Figure 3F).
These results indicated that ISL chemosensitized the drugresistant breast cancer cells primarily via the autophagylysosome pathway.

that miR-25 inhibition resulted in the increased expression
of ULK1, but not of ATG-14 (Figure 4F).
To confirm that the upregulation of ULK1 mRNA
was due to a direct decrease in the interaction between
miR-25 and its predicted binding site, we cotransfected
ADR cells with miR-25 and pMiR luciferase reporter
constructs containing 3’ untranslated region (UTR)
fragments of ULK1. The relative luciferase activity,
assessed 36 h after the transfection of the ULK1

Identification of miR-25 as the main autophagyrelated modulator targeting ULK-1 using ISL
To identify the miRNA target of ISL during
autophagy induction, an miRNA 3.0 microarray was used
to analyze the miRNA expression profiles of 3-MA-treated
MCF-7/ADR, untreated MCF-7/ADR and ISL-treated
MCF-7/ADR cells. Finally we identified 47 miRNA
genes that were differentially expressed (P<0.05) among
the three groups (Figure 4A). The autophagy activity in
the ADR cells was significantly higher than in the MCF-7
cells, and ISL further promoted the autophagy process in
the ADR cells; therefore, the miRNA differences among
the three groups were expected to follow a pattern of
ISL>ADR>3-MA or ISL<ADR<3-MA. We identified
4 miRNAs that followed these patterns; they included
miR-210, miR-25, miR-4458 and miR-30b. Using qPCR,
we validated miRNA-25 as the target of ISL-triggered
autophagy (Figure 4B).
To investigate the effect of miRNA-25 on autophagy
in ADR cells, MCF-7/ADR cells were transfected with
miR-25 inhibitors or scrambled miRNA as a negative
control. Then, autophagy flux was analyzed via LC3-II
detection. The results revealed that the inhibition of miR25 led to a significant increase in GFP-LC3-II puncta,
indicating that miR-25 may be a novel independent
modulator of autophagy (Figure 4C). The miR-25
inhibitors also resulted in decreased ADR cell proliferation
and in increased cytotoxicity from epirubicin, indicating
that miR-25 inhibition may activate autophagic cell death
(Figure 4D). To explore the mechanisms by which miR25 inhibition induced autophagy, we predicted miR-25
targets using both TargetScan and Microrna.org software.
The results showed that the autophagy-related genes
ATG14 and ULK1 were involved with the candidate
miR-25 targets. We then performed qPCR to validate this
possibility. The results showed that after treatment with
miR-25 inhibitors, the expression of ULK-1 mRNA in
MCF-7/ADR cells was significantly increased, whereas
there was little change in the amount of ATG-14 mRNA
(Figure 4E). Western blotting results further confirmed

Figure 5: ISL induces the autophagic cell death of
MCF-7/ADR cells by inhibiting miR-25 expression.

(A) qPCR results demonstrated that ISL dose-dependently
decreased miR-25 expression and increased the transcription
of its target ULK1 after 24 h of treatment (the values represent
the means ± SD, n=3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01); (B) the inhibitory
effects of ISL on miR-25 expression were exacerbated by the
addition of miR-25 inhibitors but were reversed by the addition
of miR-25 mimics. Similar effects on ULK1 expression were
found, indicating that miR-25 was the primary target of ISL
(the values represent the means ± SD, n=3,*P<0.05); (C–D)
treatment with miR-25 mimics significantly lowered the LC3-II
accumulation induced by ISL treatment at 24 h, whereas miR-25
inhibitors further enhanced the ISL-induced increase in LC3-II
expression, indicating that ISL induced autophagy flux primarily
by regulating miR-25. These results were further validated using
western blotting to reveal the expression levels of ULK1 and
LC3-II (the values represent the means ± SD, n=3, **P<0.01).

constructs, was reduced by 40.1% in the presence of miR25 but was upregulated by 35.8% when we transfected
miR-25 inhibitors with the ULK1 constructs. More
importantly, when we mutated the miR-25 binding sites in
the 3’UTR region of ULK1, miR-25 mimics or inhibitors
had little effect on the transcriptional luciferase activity,
indicating that miR-25 bound directly to the 3’UTR region
of ULK1 to affect autophagy (Figure 4G).

first assessed changes in miR-25 after ISL treatment. The
results of qPCR confirmed that ISL dose-dependently
inhibited miR-25 expression in ADR cells, which was
consistent with the results from the miRNA array. The
level of ULK1 mRNA was significantly elevated by ISL,
further implying that ULK1 was the direct target of miR25 (Figure 5A). Interestingly, the downregulation of miR25 and the upregulation of ULK1 by ISL were reversed
after treatment with miR-25 mimics; however, the
downregulation of miR-25 and the upregulation of ULK1
were aggravated by miR-25 inhibitors, implying that ISL
modulated autophagy flux primarily via miR-25 regulation
(Figure 5B). To further confirm the pivotal role of miR25 in mediating ISL-induced autophagy, we performed
fluorescence detection of LC3-II, which provided the

most direct evidence to support our hypothesis. The
results showed that miR-25 mimics dose-dependently
inhibited the autophagy induced by ISL, whereas miR25 inhibitors severely accelerated LC3-II accumulation
(Figure 5C). Additionally, western blotting results further
revealed that miR-25 mimics inhibited LC3-II and ULK1
expression, whereas the addition of miR-25 inhibitors
further increased their levels compared with ISL alone,
further confirming that ISL induced autophagy primarily
via miR-25 inhibition (Figure 5D).

stresses by attempting to maintain cellular homeostasis
by eliminating excessive or unnecessary proteins
and damaged organelles via lysosomal degradation.
Pharmacological modulation of autophagy has become
a promising strategy to overcome cancer drug resistance
[39]. Herein, we revealed that the natural chalcone-type
compound ISL aggravated autophagy in drug-resistant
breast cancer cells, which was accompanied by a G2/M
checkpoint arrest and the downregulation of ABCG2
expression. Apoptosis assays indicated that ISL treatment
of MCF-7/ADR cells led to limited apoptosis but
decreased expression of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 is well documented
to inhibit autophagy via a physical interaction with
BECN1, an essential molecule in autophagy induction
[32]; our results provided indirect evidence supporting
the autophagy-induced effects of ISL. The addition of
the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and CQ reduced the cell
death caused by ISL treatment to some degree, further
demonstrating that autophagic cell death could be the
primary mechanism of the chemosensitizing effects of
ISL. Given the significant role of ABCG2 in mediating
drug resistance and our observation that ISL inhibited
ABCG2 expression in ADR cells, we examined whether
the inhibition of ABCG2 by ISL was caused by autophagy
induction. Interestingly, we found that in ADR cells, the
autophagy induction occurred significantly sooner after
ISL treatment than the downregulation of ABCG2. The
autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and CQ restored the ABCG2
expression inhibited by ISL, indicating that the decrease
in ABCG2 was primarily caused by enhanced autophagylysosome degradation.
Recent findings have suggested that dysregulated
miRNAs were closely connected to autophagy modulation
and cancer drug resistance. Zhu et al. first reported that
miR-30a functioned in autophagy and cancer by targeting
BECN1 [40]. Emerging evidence further supports the
functional significance of miR-30a-mediated autophagy
in chemosensitizing cancer cells to anticancer drugs [41,
42]. Moreover, a number of miRNAs, such as miR-130a,
miR-101, miR-375 and miR-23b have also been reported
to participate in autophagy modulation [20]. miRNAs
possess the ability to simultaneously target multiple genes
and pathways, which is a potential advantage for drug
design and pharmacological studies. To study whether
miRNAs were also involved in ISL-mediated autophagy,
an miRNA array was used to identify the potential target
of ISL. A comparison of the different levels of expression
of miRNAs in MCF-7, MCF-7/ADR and ISL-treated cells
revealed that the miR-25 level was gradually inhibited
with increasing autophagic activity. To further validate
the significant role of miR-25 in regulating autophagy, we
transfected cells with miR-25 mimics or inhibitors. The
results revealed that miR-25 inhibition led to increased
autophagy and cell death, indicating that miR-25 was an
independent factor contributing to autophagy modulation.

To investigate whether ISL also chemosensitized
breast cancer via autophagy induction in vivo, we
constructed a drug-resistant breast cancer xenograft by
injecting MCF-7/ADR cells into the mammary pads
of NOD/SCID mice. The mice were then treated with
epirubicin or ISL. The results showed that epirubicin had
little effect in limiting cancer growth, whereas ISL alone
significantly inhibited breast cancer volume. The inhibitory
effects were the highest when ISL and epirubicin were
applied together to treat the drug-resistant breast cancer
(Figure 6A). The in vivo results were in consistent with our
in vitro findings. Immunofluorescence detection revealed
that ISL increased the LC3-II expression in breast cancer
tissue but decreased the expression of ABCG2 (Figure
6B), indicating that the chemosensitizing effects of ISL
in vivo were closely connected to autophagy induction.
To validate whether the in vivo activation of autophagy
was induced by miR-25 downregulation, we measured the
expression of miR-25 in drug-treated groups. The results
showed that ISL with or without epirubicin significantly
inhibited miR-25 expression in the tumor tissue (Figure
6C); this was accompanied by increases in the expression
of LC3-II, ULK1 and BECN1 as well as a decrease in the
expression of ABCG2 (Figure 6D). Taken together, our
data demonstrated that ISL induced the autophagic cell
death of drug-resistant breast cancer cells both in vitro
and in vivo and that miR-25 functioned as the primary
autophagy-related modulator by targeting ULK1.

DISCUSSION
In the past two decades, a number of studies
have demonstrated that compounds with low toxicity,
such as quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and
curcumin, were excellent in reversing drug resistance
in various cancer types [36-38]. Although the molecular
mechanisms of these compounds were shown to involve
multiple signaling pathways, scarce attention was paid
to the roles of autophagy-related pathways in regulating
chemoresistance. Autophagy is now emerging as a crucial
player in the response to metabolic and therapeutic

cancer biology and autophagy induction was limited.
The present study was the first to identify miR-25 as an
autophagy modulator with a role in drug resistance in
breast cancer.
To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of
miR-25-mediated autophagy, we sought to identify its
putative target genes. Using software prediction and a
luciferase reporter assay, we identified the autophagyrelated gene ULK1 as a direct target of miR-25 and
confirmed the upregulation of ULK1 expression in
ADR cells after the transfection of miR-25 inhibitors. In
mammalian cells, autophagy induction is initiated by the
ULK complex, which is composed of ULK1 or ULK2,
ATG13, FIP200 and ATG101. Under autophagy-inducing
conditions, this complex immediately senses stress signals
from upstream molecules such as mTORC1 and AMPK,
resulting in the dephosphorylation of specific residues
on ULK1/2 or ATG13 to activate phagophore formation
[43, 44]. Although numerous studies have demonstrated
that ULK1 knockdown was sufficient to block starvationinduced autophagy in multiple cell types [45, 46], the
mechanism underlying ULK1-mediated autophagy
remained largely unknown. A recent study found that
activated ULK1 directly phosphorylated BECN1 on
Ser14, enhancing the activity of Atg14L-containing
VPS34 complexes and ultimately promoting autophagy
induction and maturation [47]. In the present study, we
found that after treatment with miR-25 inhibitors, the
downstream autophagic signaling molecules BECN1
and LC3-II were both upregulated, further implying that
miR-25 functioned as a modulator in the early phase of
autophagy induction. Previously, only miR-885-3p had
been reported to regulate early autophagy by targeting
ULK2 [48]; our findings clearly expand the knowledge
concerning miRNA regulators in this phase.
To further validate the central role of miR-25 in ISLinduced autophagy, we measured changes in the levels of
miR-25 and its target gene ULK1 following ISL treatment.
The results confirmed that ISL dose-dependently inhibited
miR-25 expression, thus promoting ULK1 activation.
Additionally, the addition of miR-25 mimics effectively
abrogated the autophagy effects of ISL and therefore
restored cell proliferation, implying that miR-25 is the
primary target of ISL in autophagy induction. Over the
last decade, accumulating evidence has indicated that ISL
functions a potent anticancer agent with chemopreventive
and chemotherapeutic potential by interrupting multiple
survival signaling, such as COX-2, PI3K/Akt and NFκB. [49-52]. However, the precise mode of action of
ISL has not been completely understood, hindering
its incorporation into mainstream clinical treatment
regimens. The discovery of miRNAs provided a timely
and powerful tool to elucidate the multitarget nature of
natural compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
report to identify an miRNA target of ISL involved in
chemosensitizing breast cancer by autophagy induction.

To determine whether ISL treatment could result in
similar chemosensitizing effects in vivo, we constructed
a breast cancer xenograft with MCF-7/ADR cells. The
results revealed that ISL exerted synergistic effects with
epirubicin and induced autophagy in vivo, indicated by
increased LC3-II and decreased ABCG2 expression in
tumor tissues. The level of miR-25 in ISL-treated tumors
was also downregulated, which was accompanied by an
increase in the expression of ULK1, which was consistent
with our in vitro findings. The results suggest that ISL is a
physiological inducer of autophagy in vivo.
In conclusion, our results suggest that ISL has
potential for development as a chemosensitizing agent
for breast cancer due to its ability to inhibit miR-25
expression, which in turn leads to the upregulation of
its target gene ULK1 and the induction of autophagic
cell death, ultimately resulting in accelerated ABCG2
degradation via the lysosome pathway. Our investigation
not only revealed a novel mechanism of ISL in inducing
autophagic cell death to overcome drug resistance but
also identified miR-25 as a novel target for regulating
autophagy and chemosensitivity. However, future studies
are needed to determine the clinical implications of
miR-25 as a prognostic factor in breast cancer or other
cancer types. Moreover, the role of miR-25 in regulating
autophagy via targeting ULK1 remains to be validated in
other cancer models.

the cells were released in drug-free medium for 90 min
and subjected to flow cytometry.

The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and
the normal human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. MCF-7/ADR cells were derived by treating
MCF-7 cells with gradually increasing epirubicin for six
months. MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells were cultivated in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The MCF-10A cells
were maintained in Keratinocyte-SEM medium (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 30 μg/ml bovine
pituitary extract, 0.2 ng/ml rEGF and 1% penicillin and
streptomycin (Gibco).

miRNA 3.0 array analysis
Total RNA was extracted from the 3-MA-treated
MCF-7/ADR, untreated MCF-7/ADR and ISL-treated
MCF-7/ADR cells using the mirVana miRNA Isolation
Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). A microarray chip analysis
was performed using the Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 Array
(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), which is composed
of 19,913 probe sets for miRNAs registered in the Sanger
miRBase miRNA database, version 20 (June 2013).
Prior to the microarray analysis, the RNA quality was
confirmed using the RNA Integrity Number algorithm of
the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) at
the University of Hong Kong. All of the samples had RNA
Integrity Numbers greater than 7.0. Partek Genomics Suite
6.6 software was used to identify differences in miRNA
expression between groups with fold changes >|2|. The
TargetScan and Microrna.org programs were then applied
to predict potential protein targets and binding sites of the
selected miRNAs.

Cell proliferation analysis and colony formation
assay
The effects of epirubicin or ISL on cell proliferation
were studied using MTT as previously described [52].
Briefly, cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate at a density
of 4×103 cells/well. After serum starvation, different
concentrations of epirubicin or ISL were added to the
wells, with 6 repeats for each concentration. Cell viability
was assessed after 24 h using MTT according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Independent experiments
were performed in triplicate. To evaluate the long-term
inhibitory effects of ISL on cell proliferation, a colony
formation assay was performed. MCF-7/ADR cells were
seeded onto 6-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/
well. After cell attachment, epirubicin or ISL (alone or
in combination) was added to the wells for 4 h; the cells
were then cultured with fresh medium. After 2 weeks, the
formed colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with coomassie blue. The colonies were then
photographed and counted under a microscope.

miRNA precursor molecules, isolation and qPCR
analysis
All the synthetic miRNA mimics and inhibitors
as well as scrambled miRNAs were purchased from
Invitrogen. For the miRNA isolation and qPCR analysis,
total RNA was extracted from the cells using the mirVana
miRNA Isolation Kit. The miRcute miRNA First-strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and
qPCR Detection Kit (Tiangen) were used to measure
the expression levels of miR-25, -30b, -4458 and -210
before and after drug treatment; human U6 snRNA
served as an internal control. For mRNA quantification,
total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent, and reverse
transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was
performed using a SYBR Green kit (Roche) on the Roche
LightCycler 480 platform. The primers for miRNAs and
mRNAs are described in Supplementary Table 1. The Ct
value was measured during the exponential amplification
phase. The relative expression level (defined as the fold
change) of each target gene was determined using the
2-△△Ct method and was normalized to the fold change.

Flow cytometry analysis
For the cell cycle analysis, MCF-7/ADR cells
(3×105/well) were synchronized at G1 phase by serum
deprivation and were then treated with ISL. The cells were
harvested after 24 h. PI-stained single-cell suspensions
were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience),
and the CellQuest and ModFit programs were used for
data analysis. For the apoptosis assay, cells were seeded
onto 6-well plates at a density of 5×105/well. After ISL
treatment for 24 h, the cells were stained with Annexin
V-FITC (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) for 15 min
at room temperature. The apoptotic index was determined
using FACSCalibur with FlowJo software. For the drug
efflux assay, breast cancer cells were incubated with
epirubicin (1 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37°C. After washing,

a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then blocked in
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h, washed with
TBS and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at
4°C. After incubation with the secondary antibody for 2 h
at room temperature, the immunoreaction was visualized
using the ECL Advance reagent (GE Healthcare) and was
quantified using Quantity One software.

DAPI. For AVO observation, drug-treated or untreated
cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml AO in PBS at 37°C
for 15 min. After three washes with PBS, the cells were
visualized using fluorescence microscopy.

Generation of cell lines stably expressing GFPLC3-II

All the animal studies involving animal experiments
were reviewed and approved by the University of Hong
Kong’s Committee for the Ethical Review of Research.
MCF-7/ADR cells were resuspended in PBS at 5×106
cells/100 μl and were injected into the fourth mammary
gland fat pad of 4- to 5-week-old female NOD/SCID
mice. Each animal received subcutaneous injections of
1.5 mg of 17β-estradiol (Sigma) at three-day intervals
to support cancer growth. Tumors were measured
with a caliper at 3-day intervals, and the tumor volume
was calculated using the following formula: volume
(mm3)=width2×length/2. After the tumor size reached
approximately 5 mm×5 mm, epirubicin and ISL were
administered by intraperitoneal injection at 2.5 mg/kg/W
and 50 mg/kg/d. The tumor tissues were removed at
the end of the experiment and subjected to histological
examination or western blotting. For immunofluorescence
detection, tumor samples were rinsed in PBS and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde. The samples were then dehydrated
in an ethanol gradient, paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4
μm) for analysis. The following procedures were the same
as described above.

Breast cancer xenografts

The pSelect-GFP-hLC3 plasmid was purchased
from InvivoGen and was transfected into MCF-7/ADR
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24
h, the transfected cells were passaged and selected for
2 weeks with 200 μg/ml Zeocin (InvivoGen). Pooled
populations of positive cells were obtained 2 weeks after
drug selection without subcloning and used in in vitro
experiments.

Luciferase reporter gene assay
The 3’UTR fragments of ULK1 containing the
miRNA target sites were PCR-amplified from an MCF-7/
ADR cDNA library using FastStart Taq DNA polymerase
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The PCR products were
cloned into the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of
the pMIR-REPORT luciferase plasmid (Ambion). The
mutant 3’UTR segments of the human ULK1 mRNA,
which harbored mutations in the complementary site for
the seed region of miR-25, were generated by performing
site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type segment.
The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
For the reporter assay, 1×105 MCF-7/ADR cells were
cotransfected with 5 ng of 3’UTR reporter plasmid, 50
ng of the pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter vector
(Promega, Madison, WI) and 30 nM of miR-25 mimics
or inhibitors (Invitrogen) using the X-tremeGENE siRNA
Transfection Reagent. The transfected cells were lysed 36
h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was assayed
with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega).

Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as means ± standard
deviations (SD). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to
determine the significance of differences between groups.
Results with P values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
