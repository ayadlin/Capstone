ABSTRACT
The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is centrally involved in the
regulation of key processes of the epithelia, including cell proliferation, survival,
differentiation, and also tumorigenesis. Humanized antibodies and small-molecule
inhibitors targeting EGFR were developed to disrupt these functions in cancer cells
and are currently used in the treatment of diverse metastatic epithelial cancers. By
contrast, these drugs possess significant skin-specific toxic effects, comprising the
establishment of a persistent inflammatory milieu. So far, the molecular mechanisms
underlying these epiphenomena have been investigated rather poorly. Here we
showed that keratinocytes respond to anti-EGFR drugs with the development of
a type I interferon molecular signature. Upregulation of the transcription factor
IRF1 is early implicated in the enhanced expression of interferon-kappa, leading to
persistent activation of STAT1 and further amplification of downstream interferoninduced genes, including anti-viral effectors and chemokines. When anti-EGFR drugs
are associated to TNF-α, whose expression is enhanced by the drugs themselves, all
these molecular events undergo a dramatic enhancement by synergy mechanisms.
Finally, high levels of interferon-kappa can be observed in epidermal keratinocytes
and also in leukocytes infiltrating the upper dermis of cetuximab-driven skin lesions.
Our data suggest that dysregulated activation of type I interferon innate immunity
is implicated in the molecular processes triggered by anti-EGFR drugs and leading to
persistent skin inflammation.

manifesting on the skin [5, 6]. Within weeks from the
first administration, EGFR inhibitors typically induce a
papulopustular exanthema, histologically characterized
by a dense superficial dermal inflammatory infiltrate
surrounding hyperkeratotic and ectatic follicular
infundibula. The infiltrate is initially formed of clusters of
macrophages, dendritic cells and abundant lymphocytes,
in the context of a progressive disruption of physical/
chemical and antimicrobial epidermal barriers due to
keratinocyte dysfunction and/or death [7, 8].
Several years ago we published the first in vitro
evidence that the EGFR-ligand system has a major impact
on the pro-inflammatory functions of normal human
keratinocytes. In particular, we showed that pharmacological
blockade of EGFR boosts the expression of the monocyte-,
dendritic cell- and T cell-directed chemoattractants CCL2
and CCL5, and the T cell-selective CXCL10, whereas

INTRODUCTION
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors
are increasingly used in monotherapy or in combination
with chemo/radiotherapy for the treatment of diverse
metastatic epithelial cancers [1]. Monoclonal antibodies
such as cetuximab and panitumumab inhibit activation of
the EGFR by partially occluding its extracellular ligand
binding region, and by preventing the receptor from
adopting the conformation required for dimerization
and initiation of signal transduction [2, 3]. In contrast,
tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib,
interfere with the enzymatic activity of the intracellular
EGFR tyrosine kinase domain by competing with ATP
binding site [4]. Several adverse effects can be severe
enough to markedly reduce treatment adherence or
lead to discontinuation, the earliest and most common

it dramatically impaired the expression of GM-CSF and
CXCL8 [9–13]. A sound confirmation that the EGFR-driven
immunoregulatory function is a keratinocyte-autonomous
event was finally provided by two more recent papers from
independent laboratories [8, 14]. By performing parallel
investigations on biopsies from anti-EGFR drug-treated
cancer patients and on mouse models with EGFR ablation
in the epidermis, these Authors confirmed up-regulated
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, including the
pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and the chemokines
CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 [8, 14]. Notably, subcutaneous
injections of the type I interferon (IFN) β in multiple
sclerosis patients were shown to initiate an inflammatory
skin reaction characterized by enhanced expression of these
chemokines in keratinocytes and infiltrating leucocytes [15].
Type I IFNs are key innate immune cytokines
produced by cells to trigger antiviral, antitumor and
immunostimulatory functions [16–18]. In humans, IFN-α,
with 13 partially homologous isoforms, and IFN-β1, the
product of a single gene, are the best characterized type I
IFNs. This class of cytokines also comprises the subtypes
IFN-ε, IFN-κ and IFN-ω, whose expression is more cellrestricted. In particular, IFN-κ, initially identified as the
keratinocyte-specific type I IFN [19], was found highly
expressed also in monocytes and dendritic cells infiltrating
chronic inflammatory skin lesions [20]. Repression of
constitutive IFN-κ transcription in keratinocytes is the
major strategy of innate immune evasion by carcinogenic
papillomaviruses [21–23]. All type I IFNs share a
ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric receptor, IFN α/β
receptor (IFNAR), with IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains
signalling through two Janus family kinases, Tyk2 and Jak1,
and leading to recruitment of STAT1 to receptor-bound
STAT2, their phosphorylation and formation of STAT1STAT2 heterodimers. In the nucleus, these heterodimers
associate with the transcription factor IFN Regulatory Factor
(IRF) 9 to form the heterotrimeric complex IFN-stimulated
gene factor 3, which binds to IFN-stimulated response
elements in the promoter of IFN-inducible genes and
activates their transcription. Importantly, IFNAR can also
signal by inducing the activation and nuclear translocation
of phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers, which bind to IFNγ-activated sequences in the promoters of IFN-γ-induced
genes. Eventually, STAT1-dependent transactivation of
both these promoter elements cooperates for the enhanced
expression of proteins involved in anti-viral, anti-tumor, and
also in pro-inflammatory mechanisms, including CCL2,
CCL5, and the CXCR3 ligand CXCL10 [24, 25].
In our search for a finer definition of the mechanisms
underlying the skin inflammatory condition triggered by
anti-EGFR drugs, we collected evidence that these agents
induce an IRF1-mediated activation of the type I IFN
signalling pathway. These events could be reproduced by
a MEK-selective inhibitor. Up-regulated expression of
anti-viral and pro-inflammatory effectors are among their
downstream consequences.

The EGFR inhibitor PD168393 perturbs TNF-αdriven gene expression and induces a type I IFN
signature
In our search for pathogenic mechanisms underlying
anti-EGFR drug-driven skin inflammation, we applied a
whole-genome gene expression screening approach by
Illumina microarrays (GSE74407), intentionally focusing
on the combined use of the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor PD168393 (PD16) and TNF-α rather than on the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone. In doing so, we wanted
to magnify gene expression perturbation by the use of
this well-characterized experimental condition [9–12],
thereby preventing possible sensitivity limits known to be
associated to the microarray technique when compared to
other techniques, including quantitative real-time RT-PCR
[26, 27]. Normal human skin keratinocytes were treated
with TNF-α for 6h, with or without co-incubation with the
EGFR small-molecule inhibitor PD16. Class comparison
was performed by application of the univariate two-sample
t-test to the expression values of the 47,199 transcripts
recognized by the Illumina beadchip microarrays in a low
stringency analysis (p<0.005), or to a fraction of 9,022
transcripts selected by intensity/quality expression filtering
in a high stringency analysis (p<0.001). By application of
these two distinct analysis criteria, differentially expressed
genes in the comparison between TNF-α and untreated
control allowed the generation of Supplementary Table S1
with total 772 dysregulated transcripts, and Supplementary
Table S2 restricted to 106 of these transcripts, respectively.
Genes in Supplementary Table S2 were then filtered for
Gene Ontology-annotated genes only with a >2.0 or <0.5
fold change, and the resulting 38 genes were eventually
clustered in biological processes (Table 1). The most
significant biological process activated by TNF-α at
6h time-point was cell-cell signaling as expected, with
upregulated expression of a number of genes encoding for
proteins of the IL-1 system (IL-1β, IL-36γ, IL-1ra, IL1R2),
GM-CSF, the TNF-superfamily subunit lymphotoxin
beta and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL10, CCL27, CCL20).
Signal transducers of the TNF receptor-activated cascade
(C1QTNF1, TNFAIP2, TNFAIP3, IRAK2, TNIP TRAF1),
and NF-κB-responsive genes (RELB and NFKIA) were
also found highly significantly up-regulated. Finally,
a small group of genes encoding for proteins involved
in extracellular matrix organization and disassembly,
including the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 9 and 10
and the heparan sulphate-rich proteoglycan syndecan 4
(SDC4), were among the most strongly up-regulated genes
in response to TNF-α (Table 1).
By contrast, statistical analysis performed with
the two stringency criteria described above and aimed at
the identification of differentially expressed genes in the
comparison between PD16+TNF-α and TNF-α gave rise

Only transcripts of annotated genes with FDR-adjusted p values ≤0.001 and fold-change values ≥2.0 or ≤0.5 were considered
to a much more articulate picture, with 2,947 differentially
expressed transcripts (p<0.005, Supplementary Table S3),
or a selected fraction of 545 highly significant differentially
expressed transcripts (p<0.001, Supplementary Table S4).
Finally, 92 up-regulated and 104 down-regulated Gene
Ontology annotated genes were clustered according to
Table 2. Quite unexpectedly, the most enriched group
of up-regulated transcripts belonged to the type I IFN
response, including transcription factors (STAT1, STAT2)
and a number of effectors of the innate antiviral response
[28, 29] (Table 2). Among these, the IFN-induced proteins
with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1, 2 and 3 possess
a broad-spectrum activity which includes inhibition of
viral replication and cell apoptosis [30]. In addition, upregulated expression of several enzymes involved in the
cytochrome P450-mediated xenobiotic metabolism and
in distinct oxidation-reduction processes, as well as some
markers of cell cycle arrest and autophagy, were also
peculiar of this experimental condition. In keeping with
the central role of EGFR in the control of keratinocyte
gene expression homeostasis [31], transcription, signal
transduction, transmembrane transport, apoptotic process
and small-molecule metabolic process, underwent complex
perturbation, whereas other processes were dramatically
suppressed, mainly including ribosome assembly and
nucleologenesis, cytoskeleton organization, mitotic cell
cycle and keratinocyte differentiation (Table 2). In the
immune cell-cell signalling cluster, transcripts encoding
for several cytokines and chemokines significantly upregulated by TNF-α alone (Table 1), including members
of IL-1 superfamily, GM-CSF, CXCL8 and CCL20 were
found suppressed by PD16+TNF-α, while lymphotoxin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

beta and CXCL10 were further induced (Table 2). Finally,
the extracellular matrix metalloproteinases MMP9 and
MMP10, but not SDC4, were down-regulated upon
PD16+TNF-α treatment (Table 2).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays confirm
microarray data
SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time RTPCR was performed to verify our microarray data, and
analyze time-dependent changes in the expression of a
small cluster of differentially expressed transcripts. This
cluster comprised genes highly differentially expressed
in response to PD16+TNF-α vs TNF-α, including the
most strongly (i.e. 26.7-fold) up-regulated transcript of
the cytochrome P450 superfamily member CYP1A1, the
chemokine CXCL10, and the type I IFN response genes
IFIT2 and STAT1 (p<0.001, Table 2). We also included
the transcripts for the cytokine TNF-α, the transcription
factor IRF1, and the keratinocyte-specific type I IFN-κ,
all significantly upregulated (>2-fold change) according
to low stringency analysis (p<0.005, Supplementary
Table S3). Noteworthy, our microarray data clearly
indicated that IFN-κ was the only type I IFN that could be
found constitutively expressed in our Illumina beadchip
data in unstimulated keratinocytes (mean IFN-κ transcript
expression values in triplicate unstimulated controls:
299.77; background noise: <150), while all IFN-α
isoforms and IFN-β1 were undetectable (GSE74407).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that TNF-α
induced the transcription of IRF1, TNF-α, CXCL10
and IFIT2, with peak values at 6h (Figure 1A–1D).

still high following PD16+TNF-α at this time-point.
Increase of P-STAT1 was detected only at 3h stimulation
following TNF-α, but underwent a strong improvement
with PD16+TNF-α (Figure 2C). Enhanced P-p65, IRF1
and P-STAT1 levels were still detectable after 6h treatment
with anti-EGFR agents combined to TNF-α, as observed
in total cell lysates (Figure 2D). Finally, up-regulated IRF1
and P-STAT1 were also induced by the selective MEK
inhibitor PD98059 (Figure 2E). These results documented
that human keratinocytes respond to anti-EGFR drugs or
MEK inhibition with a delayed, sustained activation of
transcription factors characteristic of type I IFN signalling
pathways. In addition, a robust synergism is evoked when
anti-EGFR drugs are associated to TNF-α.

These genes were induced also by PD16 alone, but their
expression was dramatically enhanced by concomitant
administration of PD16 and TNF-α, with a shift in the
peak of CXCL10 and IFIT2 to 10h (Figure 1C and 1D).
By contrast, PD16 only could induce STAT1, IFN-κ
and CYP1A1 gene expression, which was significantly
reduced by TNF-α co-administration (Figure 1E–1G).
Finally, these molecular events could be reproduced by
the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors gefitinib (2 μM)
and erlotinib (2 μM, not shown), and by the anti-EGFR
antibody cetuximab (25 μg/ml) (Figure 1H–1N), with
this last drug acting extracellularly and hence ineffective
on CYP1A1 induction (Figure 1N). In their whole, these
data confirmed that EGFR inhibition per se triggers the
expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and generates
a type I IFN response in normal human keratinocytes.
The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α enhanced distinct
components of this response, as observed for IRF1,
TNF-α, IFIT2 and CXCL10, but opposed others, including
STAT1 and IFN-κ.

IRF1 and STAT1 are functionally involved in
PD16-driven gene expression
In order to functionally confirm IRF1 and STAT1
direct involvement in keratinocyte gene expression
response upon EGFR blockade, we performed experiments
of selective impairment of these two transcription factors.
IRF1-targeted specific small interference RNA (Si-IRF1)
impaired both IRF1 transcription and translation (Figure
3A and 3B), but also led to strong suppression of IFIT2,
CXCL10 and TNF-α transcription in response to PD16,
TNF-α or their combination (Figure 3C–3E). In addition,
a significant reduction of PD16-driven STAT1 and IFN-κ
gene expression was observed (Figure 3F–3G), indicating
that IRF1 is critically implicated in the transcription of
all these genes. Effective abrogation of both constitutive
and induced STAT1 phosphorylation (Figure 3A), but
also suppression of both basal and induced STAT1 gene
transcription (Figure 3F) were observed in response
to anti-IFNAR2 blocking antibody (IFNAR block.),
indicating that functional IFNAR is required for both
these events. Despite whole-cell protein levels of IRF1
(Figure 3A), we reproducibly observed a significant
decrease in PD16- and/or TNF-α-induced expression
of this transcription factor in the absence of functional
IFNAR (Figure 3B). This experimental condition also
associated to a profound suppression of IFIT2 and
CXCL10 (Figure 3C and 3D) and a tendency to modestly
reduce TNF-α gene expression (Figure 3E), while it did
not perturb IFN-κ transcription (Figure 3G).

IRF1 and STAT1 are activated in response to
EGFR or MEK inhibition
Inhibition of EGFR signalling implies profound
inactivation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in
epithelial cells, including skin keratinocytes [32]. A
considerable body of independent observations indicates
that this pathway exerts a negative regulation on type I
IFN response [33, 34], with IRF1 recognized among its
molecular targets [35–37]. Anti-EGFR drugs induced a
strong suppression of ERK phosphorylation, as expected
(Figure 2A). IRF1 was barely detectable in the nuclei
of unstimulated keratinocytes, and underwent a slow
accumulation in response to the anti-EGFR treatments,
while high levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1)
could be observed throughout the 3-10h interval
(Figure 2A). Both STAT2 and IRF9 were present in
unstimulated cells. Similar to STAT1, IRF9 levels tended
to increase with the treatments. Also the NFκB subunit
p65 was abundant in the nuclear lysates, but no P-p65
could be detected following anti-EGFR drugs (data not
shown). By contrast, keratinocytes responded to TNF-α
with a long-lasting increase of nuclear P-p65, while
IRF1 was detected in the 3-9h interval and P-STAT1,
STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 displayed a rather modest
increase (Figure 2B). Importantly, combination of PD16
and TNF-α led to a strong enrichment of nuclear IRF1
and P-STAT1, both peaking at 6h, and also of STAT1,
STAT2 and IRF9 (Figure 2B). Some enhancement of
P-p65 at 6 and 12h could also be reproducibly observed
(Figure 2B). An analysis of these molecular events at
earlier time-points showed TNF-α-driven P-p65 nuclear
translocation peaking at 30 min and almost vanishing
at 1h, whereas this signal persisted with PDl6+TNF-α
(Figure 2C). Analogously, TNF-α-induced nuclear IRF1
peaked at 2h but almost disappeared at 3h, while it was

Anti-EGFR drugs enhance the expression of
IFN-κ
In keeping with our data of enhanced IFN-κ
gene transcription, we observed strong up-regulation
of IFN-κ protein expression in response to anti-EGFR
drugs and, although more modestly, to the experimental
anti-MEK agent PD98059 (Si-mock, Figure 4A). AntiIFN-κ transcript-specific small interference RNA (SiIFNK) impaired IFN-κ transcription (Figure 4B) and
translation, along with deep suppression of P-STAT1

Down-regulation of IRF1 and, more significantly, of
STAT1, IFIT2 and CXCL10, and a weak reduction of
TNF-α transcription could be detected (Figure 4C–4G),
directly confirming the involvement of IFN-κ in human
keratinocyte response to EGFR or MEK inhibition.

We found IFN-κ highly expressed in the lesional
skin of patients treated with cetuximab (Figure 5B, 5E, and

in the epidermis of healthy skin (Figure 5A), a strong

throughout the whole epidermis and also in dermal cell
populations, including dendritic cell-like bodies infiltrating
the upper dermis (Figure 5B, 5C and 5E). Intense IFN-κ
staining was also associated to the damaged layers of
keratinocytes at the initial stage of a pilosebaceous unit
destruction (Figure 5B and 5D). Positivity was retained
even in the cetuximab-induced spongiotic epidermis
(Figure 5F), a histopathologic feature of acute dermatitis
characterized by scattered intraepidermal fluid-containing
spaces due to keratinocyte apoptosis [38].

High stringency class comparison analysis of our
Illumina microarrays highlighted a rather limited number
of highly significantly perturbed genes in response to
TNF-α in normal human keratinocytes. By contrast, coadministration of PD16 and TNF-α led to an articulate
alteration of TNF-α-driven keratinocyte transcriptional
program, in keeping with the central role of EGFR
signalling in epithelial cell biology [31]. Up-regulated
expression of a small cluster of cytokines (including
TNF-α and beta subunit of lymphotoxin) and chemokines
(including CCL2 and CXCL10), but suppression of
distinct TNF-α-induced mediators (including CXCL8 and
GM-CSF), confirmed previous findings from keratinocyte
cultures in vitro, animal models in vivo, and skin lesions
of patients under treatment with anti-EGFR drugs ex vivo
[8, 10-12, 14]. Quite unexpectedly, class comparison
analysis clearly indicated that the combination of TNF-α
and EGFR inhibition induced upregulated expression of
a relevant number of genes characteristic of type I IFN
signalling pathway, including the transcription factors
STAT1 and 2, and a cluster of effectors involved in
viral clearance. Among these antiviral effectors, IFIH1/
MDA5 is a pattern recognition receptor involved in
the detection of cytosolic viral double-stranded RNA
and RNA intermediates; IFITM1 inhibits viral entry by
contrasting the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes;
IFIT1, 2, and 3 mainly act by inhibiting distinct steps of

DISCUSSION
Here we presented evidence that anti-EGFR drugs
autonomously trigger activation of signal transduction
pathways responsible of enhanced expression of IFN-κ,
leading to persistent activation of STAT1 and consequent
induction of the antiviral native immunity and of the
inflammatory response in human keratinocytes. In the
skin lesions of patients under treatment with cetuximab,
strong expression of IFN-κ characterized all layers of
epidermal keratinocytes and also leukocyte populations
infiltrating the upper dermis. This observation indicates
that by a direct action of cetuximab, and/or by
keratinocyte-derived cytokine/chemokine milieu, type I
IFN response conditions the whole immune response in
these lesions.

IRF1 functional state, leading to effective control on the
transactivation of a subset of genes which includes IFN-κ.
To our knowledge, the mechanism of this regulation has
not been clarified yet.
Type I IFN signalling is constitutively active in
many cell types, including epithelial cells. Previous reports
[20, 44] and our own evidence indicate that unstimulated
keratinocytes express low levels of IFN-κ. Through this
pathway, cells maintain basal expression of STAT1 and its
downstream targets, in their turn involved not only in the
antiviral defence and in the immuno-activation, but also in
cell survival, cell cycle regulation and differentiation [17].
Impairment of the EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade by
anti-EGFR, anti-Raf, or anti-MEK anti-cancer drugs could
enhance type I IFN response, giving rise to inflammatory
events in the skin and possibly also in the intestinal
tract, the two most important targets of their adverse
events [13]. Indeed, type I IFNs frequently do cause
dermatological side effects [45]. Subcutaneous injections
of IFN-β in multiple sclerosis patients were shown to
initiate an inflammatory skin reaction characterized by
enhanced CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 in keratinocytes and
infiltrating leucocytes [15], actually the same chemokines
strongly up-regulated in response to EGFR inhibition
in human and mouse keratinocytes, in vitro and in vivo
[8-11, 14]. Analogously, in vivo evidence suggests that
type I IFNs may have a pro-inflammatory activity also in
the colonic epithelium [46], including IFNAR-mediated
enhanced expression of TNF-α, CCL2 and CXCL10 and
consequent massive infiltration of leukocyte populations
involved in tissue damage [47, 48]. Nonetheless, in the
context of epithelial malignancies, these mechanisms
could provide a further anti-cancer activity concomitant
to apoptosis promotion, due to improved recruitment of
functional antigen presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells
within neoplastic lesions [39, 49].
We also observed that abrogation of IFN-κ
functional interaction with its receptor by IFNAR2targeted neutralizing antibody, or IFN-κ silencing,
similarly suppressed both constitutive and induced STAT1
gene expression and phosphorylation, with consequent
strong impairment of IFIT2 and CXCL10 transcription
and a rather milder, although statistically significant,
reduction of IRF1, but no relevant perturbation of TNF-α.
Notably, despite its inability to enhance IFN-κ gene
expression, we reproducibly observed TNF-α-induced
STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These
events were suppressed by IFNAR2 blockade, indicating
that they were fully dependent on the formation of the type
I IFN/IFNAR signalling complex. Among all type I IFNs,
only IFN-κ and IFN-β are heparin binding cytokines [20].
When released in the extracellular milieu, they establish
a high affinity interaction with the extracellular heparan
sulphate chains of membrane proteoglycans, mainly
including SDCs [50], and hence they are practically
undetectable in cell supernatants [51]. This binding

the translation of viral mRNA; also OAS1, OASL, GBP2,
RNASE4 and HERC5 are involved in the inhibition of
RNA virus translation and replication, while RSAD2/
viperin is active in the early as well as in the late (egress)
stages of virus life cycle [18, 29]. Beyond their antiviral
functions, independent observations suggest that some
of these proteins may mediate tissue damage during
cell response to type I IFNs. In particular, IFITs possess
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities [30, 39].
Experiments designed to validate our microarray data both
at the transcript and protein level confirmed that type I IFN
signalling activation was not restricted to the combination
of TNF-α and PD16, since it could be reproduced by antiEGFR drugs alone.
Mechanistically, we observed that anti-EGFR
drugs induced de novo gene expression and progressive
nuclear enrichment of IRF1, and robustly synergized in
this process with TNF-α, in its turn an inducer of IRF1.
Silencing experiments confirmed IRF1 involvement in
the expression of CXCL10, TNF-α and IFIT2 upon PD16
and/or TNF-α stimulation. They also showed that IRF1
expression was implicated in the induction of IFN-κ,
with TNF-α totally ineffective and even opposing antiEGFR drug-induced expression of this cytokine. In the
literature, TNF-α-driven IRF1 activation was shown to
upregulate IFN-β, leading to sustained STAT1-dependent
expression of antiviral effectors and pro-inflammatory
mediators, including TNF-α, CCL2 and CXCL10 in
primary macrophages [40] and endothelial cells [41].
In contrast with these reports, our data suggest that
MEK/ERK suppression is required for IRF1 and/or its
partner(s) to transactivate IFN-κ gene in normal human
keratinocytes. A considerable body of independent
observations actually confirms that MEK/ERK activity
exerts a negative regulation on IRF1 transcriptional
activity and eventually on type I IFN response [33,
34], and that this regulation can be effectively reverted
by MEK/ERK inhibition [35–37]. All these reports are
based on cells with a strong MEK/ERK activation due
to oncogenic Ras [33, 36–37] or to viral infections [34,
35]. EGFR-dependent down-regulation of IRF1 and, as
a consequence, of IRF1-dependent type III IFN-λ, was
shown to be the strategy exploited by some respiratory
viruses to suppress the antiviral response in human airway
epithelial cells, a mechanism effectively reverted by EGFR
inhibition [42]. Finally, very similar to what we found
in keratinocytes, cetuximab induced type I IFN/STAT1
signature in A431 human epidermal carcinoma cell line
harbouring oncogenic Ras, with enhanced transcription of
STAT1, a number of antiviral effectors (IFIT1, IFITM1,
RSAD2, OAS1, and OAS2 among others), and also proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α and very high
lymphotoxin beta [43]. From these and our own findings,
we can reasonably hypothesize that sustained activity
of the EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK phosphorylation
cascade might exert a permanent, tonic regulation on

including cell entry, replication, and viral antagonism
to the host anti-viral systems, and EGFR inhibition has
been proposed as a novel approach for prevention and/
or treatment of viral infection [63]. Notably, despite
their strong suppressive effect of antibacterial innate
immunity, many reports document that anti-EGFR
drugs do possess anti-viral activity. Erlotinib impairs
infection by all major hepatitis C virus genotypes and
viral escape variants in cell cultures and in a human liver
chimeric mouse model in vivo [64, 65]. Erlotinib also
diminishes infectivity of specific strains of syncytial
virus in respiratory epithelial cell cultures and in mouse
models in vivo [66]. Analogously, gefitinib was shown
to suppress influenza A virus and rhinovirus infection
of bronchial epithelial cells and in mouse models [42].
These respiratory viruses suppress the antiviral defence
of airway epithelium by inducing EGFR activation,
leading to IRF1 suppression and consequent loss of
type III IFN-λ, a mechanism that is reverted by EGFR
inhibition [42]. Human keratinocytes infected with highrisk papillomaviruses were shown to possess a reduced
capacity to attract immune cells due to EGFR-dependent
impairment of chemokine expression, including CCL2
and the CXCL10 homologue CXCL9, an event that was
restored by cetuximab [67]. Since papillomaviruses
were shown to repress IFN-κ to prevent pathogen
recognition receptor and antiviral-gene expression [22],
the possibility exists that cetuximab might exert its
pro-inflammatory and antiviral activity essentially by
enhancing IFN-κ expression in infected keratinocytes.
Our data emphasize the regulatory role of the
EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK on type I IFN response in
normal human keratinocytes. Aberrant activation of this
response by impairment of the EGFR-driven pathway may
lead to the establishment of a pro-inflammatory milieu in
the skin and presumably in other epithelia, eventually
precipitating unwanted tissue damage and susceptibility
to bacterial infections. Since these mechanisms are likely
to be instrumental to the anti-cancer efficacy of EGFR, Raf- and MEK-directed inhibitors, improvement in
the targeted delivery of these drugs to malignant cells
represents a valid strategy in the effort to limit their off
target toxicity [68].

keeps IFNs close to the site of secretion, but in the same
time finely tunes their interaction with IFNAR [52]. Our
microarray data showed that SDC4 gene expression was
highly significantly up-regulated in response to TNF-α
with or without PD16. Hence, it is possible that TNF-α
triggers shedding of pre-formed SDC4-bound IFN-κ and
eventual IFNAR transactivation via a triple-membranepassing signal [53], in the absence of de novo IFN-κ
expression. TNF-α was already shown to exploit such a
mechanism in human keratinocytes, with MMP-mediated
shedding of the mature forms of the EGFR ligands
and consequent EGFR transactivation [10]. Further
investigation is however required to confirm the existence
of a TNF receptor-IFNAR cross-talk.
Our data show that anti-EGFR drugs induce
IFN-κ in normal human keratinocytes and this cytokine
is implicated in the enhanced expression of proinflammatory mediators. Strong IFN-κ immunoreactivity
in the lesional skin of patients undergoing anti-cancer
therapy with cetuximab suggests that these mechanisms
are active in vivo. In these lesions, IFN-κ was not confined
to keratinocytes but also stained the inflammatory infiltrate
of the upper dermis including dendritic-shaped cells,
indicating that anti-EGFR-dictated activation of type
I IFN response involves leukocyte populations. This
could be due to a direct effect of the drug on these cells,
or, indirectly, to keratinocyte-generated local cytokine/
chemokine milieu, active both in their recruitment and
activation towards a type I IFN response. Enhanced IFN-κ
expression in the epidermis and in dermal monocytes and
dendritic cells was previously described in lesions of
patients with chronic inflammatory skin disorders [20, 44].
In vitro, IFN-κ or IFN-β was shown to enhance dendritic
cell release of TNF-α and IL-10 [20]. Of relevance,
IL-10 is a well-recognized regulatory cytokine, with
suppressive effects on dendritic cell functional maturation
[54] and on keratinocyte expression of the anti-microbial
peptides beta-defensin-2 and -3 and cathelicidin LL37
[55, 56], whose synergistic activity leads to effective
killing of Staphylococcus aureus [57]. Hence, abnormal
activation of type I IFN response in the infiltrate could
misdirect the immune response and further aggravate
the defective expression of antimicrobial peptides due
to EGFR inhibition in keratinocytes [8], leading to high
susceptibility to Staph. aureus skin infections in patients
undergoing treatment with these EGFR inhibitors [8, 58].
Mounting evidence actually indicates that type I IFNs can
exert a deleterious effect in bacterial infections [16, 59],
and may be involved in harmful rather than beneficial
functions [60]. For instance, type I IFNs are considered
crucially implicated in the increased susceptibility to
post-influenza Staph. aureus respiratory superinfections
[61, 62], a tremendous cause of human morbidity and
mortality.
Many viruses activate EGFR and exploit EGFRmediated signalling for critical steps in their life cycle,

comprising 47,199 specific probes for genes annotated
on National Center for Biotechnology Information
Reference Sequence Database, RefSeq Release 38
(November 7, 2009). Chip scanning was performed
on an iScan system (iScan Control Software). Probe
intensity signals were processed with a Genome Studio
Expression Module, which allowed a per-quantile
normalization. Normal human keratinocytes were
treated for 6h with 50 ng/ml TNF-α, with or without
concomitant administration of the experimental EGFR
inhibitor PD168393 (2 μM). cRNA was obtained from
total RNA, and analyzed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The complete dataset of our study is
available from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus database
(GSE74407). Gene expression profiles were analyzed
using the class comparison between-groups function of
BRB-ArrayTools (Richard Simon and BRB-ArrayTools
Development Team) at the BioInformatics Service
(Unimed Scientifica, Rome, Italy). False discovery
rate was computed per gene using the Benjamini and
Hochberg method [70]. The class comparison function
also performs random permutations of the class labels,
recomputing the t tests of each gene for each random
permutation.
Differentially modulated genes were identified
using the two- sample t test, with p<0.001 and false
discovery rate <0.1 as significance thresholds. Since our
arrays have a small number of samples (n = 3) per class,
differentially expressed genes were also evaluated using
the random variance version of the two-sample t test, as
suggested by the BRB-ArrayTools user manual. In this
case, differentially modulated genes were identified using
the random variance version of the two- sample t test,
with p<0.005 and false discovery rate <0.1 as significance
thresholds, for a lower stringency analysis. Tools and
databases provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium
were used for functional categorization of genes into
major biological processes [71, 72].

Paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens from skin
lesions of patients under treatment with cetuximab,
psoriasis lesions and normal human skin were previously
described [12]. Briefly, four-mm punch biopsies were taken
from lesional skin of adult patients with a mild to moderate
cetuximab-associated papulo-pustular skin rash (n = 8, three
females and five males, age 50-66), chronic plaque psoriasis
(n = 5, two females and three males, age 30-48) and from
normal skin of healthy subjects (n = 7, three females and
four males, age 24-59). Epidermal sheets for keratinocyte
cultures were obtained from healthy individuals undergoing
plastic surgery (mammoplasty or abdominoplasty) (n = 4,
two females and two males, age 25-40).

Keratinocyte cultures and treatments
Primary cultures of normal human keratinocytes
were obtained as previously described [69], and routinely
grown in serum-free Keratinocyte Growth Medium from
Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA). This medium is formed
of an essential Keratinocyte Basal Medium nutrient
solution supplemented with 0.2 ng/ml EGF, 0.18 μg/
ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 0.2% bovine
pituitary extract, and gentamicin sulfate solution. In the 24
hours preceding and during the experiments, subconfluent
cell cultures were switched to Keratinocyte Basal Medium.
All assays were performed on human keratinocytes obtained
from at least three distinct healthy donors.

Chemicals and reagents
The small-molecule, cell permeant EGFR kinase
inhibitor PD168393 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 were
purchased from Selleckchem (Munich, Germany). Gefitinib
and Erlotinib were from Cayman (La Jolla, CA, USA).
All these chemicals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO). In all experiments, the DMSO concentration
as vehicle control was 0.1% (v/v). Cetuximab (5 mg/ml,
Erbitux®) was provided by the Hospital Pharmacy at the
Istituto Dermopatico dell’Immacolata. TNF-α was from
R&D Systems (Milan, Italy). Where specified, we employed
a neutralizing antibody targeting the human IFN-α/β receptor
chain 2 (IFNAR2, CD118) (MMHAR-2, Cat. No. 21385-1,
PBL Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). PCR were performed in a volume of 25 μl
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem,
Foster City, CA) and 1:25-1:40 dilution of cDNA. The
primer sets were designed using Universal Probe Library
Assay Design Center (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg,
Germany), were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich (Milan,
Italy), and are listed in Supplementary Table S5. PCR
products were measured by the ABI PRISM 5700 detection
system (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Quantification
was performed by the comparative CT method [73]. All
determinations were performed in triplicate.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
48 h incubation, SiRNA-transfected keratinocytes were
exposed for 6h to distinct treatments. The supernatants
were subsequently collected and the cell pellet used for
RNA or total protein extraction.

Keratinocyte lysis

FUNDING

Total cell lysis was performed with a RIPA buffer
composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate,
in the presence of an antiprotease cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Nuclear lysates were
performed as described [74] with slight modifications.
Briefly, keratinocytes were lysed in an hypotonic buffer
(10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM
EGTA) supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate
and an anti-protease cocktail. The lysate was centrifuged
at 1,800xg for 10 min to precipitate nuclei. The nuclear
pellet was finally lysed by an hypertonic buffer C (20 mM
HEPES, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, in
the presence of 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and an
antiprotease cocktail). During all the phases, cell lysates
were kept on an ice bath.
