ABSTRACT
ERBB3/HER3 is emerging as a molecular target for various cancers. HER3 is
overexpressed and activated in a number of cancer types under the conditions of
acquired resistance to other HER family therapeutic interventions such as tyrosine
kinase inhibitors and antibody therapies. Regulation of the HER3 expression and
signaling involves numerous HER3 interacting proteins. These proteins include PI3K,
Shc, and E3 ubiquitin ligases NEDD4 and Nrdp1. Furthermore, recent identification
of a number of HER3 oncogenic mutations in colon and gastric cancers elucidate the
role of HER3 in cancer development. Despite the strong evidence regarding the role of
HER3 in cancer, the current understanding of the regulation of HER3 expression and
activation requires additional research. Moreover, the lack of biomarkers for HER3driven cancer poses a big challenge for the clinical development of HER3 targeting
antibodies. Therefore, a better understanding of HER3 regulation should improve the
strategies to therapeutically target HER3 for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

proliferation, organ development and organ repair [1, 7].
The HER receptor family is composed of an extracellular
domain (responsible for ligand binding), the α-helical
transmembrane segment, and the intracellular protein
tyrosine kinase domain which mediates interactions with
intracellular signaling molecules [8]. In the absence of
a ligand, EGFR, HER3 and HER4 exist in a tethered
(closed) conformation in which the dimerization domain
is not available for the other HER family members [16].
In contrast, HER2 has no known ligand, exists in active
extended (open) conformation and can form oligomer,
homodimers, and heterodimers with other HER family
receptors [8, 9, 15].
Ligands of the HER family receptors are divided into
three groups. The first group includes epidermal growth
factor (EGF), amphiregulin (AR), and transforming
growth factor-α (TGF-α), that bind specifically to EGFR.
The second group of ligands include betacellulin (BTC),
heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), and epiregulin (EPR)
which exhibit specificity for both HER1 and HER4
[17]. The third group of ligands include the neuregulins
(NRG, also known as Neu differentiation factors, NDFs,

The HER3 receptor
Several excellent reviews describing the role of
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family
members, including HER3, have been published in
recent years [1-14]. The focuses of the current review
are on the regulation of HER3 expression and function
by E3 ubiquitin ligases, and the challenges in developing
HER3-targeting antibody cancer therapies due to the
lack of biomarkers. EGFR family members play an
important role in development and oncogenesis [4,
6, 15]. The HER family is comprised of four closely
related transmembrane receptors, EGFR (HER1), HER2
(ERRB2), HER3 (ERBB3) and HER4 (ERBB4) [1]. All
receptors except for HER2 interact with multiple ligands.
Ligands binding to their receptors trigger a complex and
tightly controlled array of signaling pathways involved in
the regulation of various cellular functions, including cell

or heregulins, HRG) which include two subgroups based
on their capacity to bind HER3 and HER4 (NRG1 and
NRG2) or only HER4 (NRG3 and NRG4) [18, 19]. NRGs
are predominantly found in parenchymal organs and in
the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems.
The receptor-ligand binding stimulates the formation
of homodimers and heterodimers between the HER
receptors, leading to the autophosphorylation of a number
of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues. These residues in turn
serve as docking sites for many adaptor and signaling
proteins for receptor activation [20, 21]. However, HER
receptor activation is more complex and exceptions exist.
It was reported that EGFR can form homodimers without
ligand stimulation, but ligand binding to the homodimers
is required for signaling [22]. Ligand independent HER3
signaling has also been reported recently [23].

which wrap around the axons to provide electrical
insulation). Further, homozygous HER3 mutant embryos
lack Schwann-cell precursors, which leads to the cell
death of motor and sensory neurons at the later stages
of development in HER3 mutant pups. This abnormality
thereby implicates an important role of HER3 in
nervous system development [34]. Furthermore, the
role of HER3 in mouse mammary gland development
was investigated by transplanting mammary buds from
HER3 -/- embryos into cleared mammary fat pads of
immune compromised wild type mice. HER3 -/- buds
only partially filled the mammary fat pad, however,
lobuloalveolar development of HER3 -/- transplanted
glands was normal [35]. The broader conclusion of the
study was that mammary outgrowth defect in HER3 -/- was
associated with a decrease in the size of the terminal end
buds, increase in the branch density and increase in the
number of terminal buds. In addition, although a lack of
HER3 did not affect the proliferation rate, it did increase
the apoptosis in HER3 -/- terminal end buds, suggesting
HER3 is required for ductal morphogenesis in the mouse
mammary gland [35]. The phenotype induced by a lack
of HER3 in the development of mouse mammary gland
was more pronounced than the knock out of any of the
other HER receptors, alluding to the significance of HER3
in mammary development [35]. This conclusion was
supported by the work by other investigators. In another
study, when HER3 expression in the mammary gland
was inhibited by Cre recombinase, the mammary glands
analyzed after 4 and 8 weeks also exhibited lower ductal
density, fewer branches and fewer terminal bud end buds
[36] . An additional study demonstrated HER3 maintains
the balance between luminal and basal breast epithelium.
A loss of HER3 in the mouse luminal mammary epithelial
cells lead to impaired AKT and MAPK signaling as well
as reduced luminal proliferation and survival [37].

Role of HER3 in development
HER family receptors are expressed in cells
of epithelial, mesenchymal and neuronal lineages.
Additionally, the receptors are expressed in endothelial
and cardiac cells, where they play a diverse role in
proliferation and differentiation [24, 25]. Furthermore,
HER family receptors play a significant role in the
development and maintenance of various integrative body
systems such as cardiovascular and nervous system as
demonstrated by the gene knock out studies. EGFR knock
out (KO) mice show embryonic or perinatal lethality. Mice
with a naturally occurring germ line mutation in kinase
domain of EGFR (known as Waved 2) are viable but
display epithelial defects such as wavy hair phenotype.
Mutant mice exhibit impaired epithelial development in
several organs resulting in peri-implantation death to live
progeny with abnormalities in organs such as the liver
and the skin depending on genetic background [26, 27].
HER2 KO and HER4 KO animals exhibit embryonic day
(ED) 10 lethality due to aberrant cardiac and peripheral
nervous system development [28, 29]. Furthermore,
HER4 conditional mutant mice display abnormalities in
central nervous system and mammary gland [30]. HER2
conditional knockout mice display severely dialated
cardiomyopathy with cardiac dysfunction appearing by
second post natal month [31]. HER3 KO mice exhibit
ED13.5 lethality due to defective valve formation,
pronounced heart defects (double-outlet right ventricle
and atrio-ventricular cushion defects) and vasculature
abnormalities [32]. Specifically, HER3 knock out mice
have hypoplastic cardiac cushions with decreased
mesenchyme [33]. HER3 is expressed on endocardial
cushion cells and mesenchymal cells undergoing EMT.
This is in contrast to EGFR, HER2 and HER4 expression
which is largely limited to cardiomycytes during the
critical cushion forming period [25].
NRGs and HER receptors are implicated in control
of the growth and development of Schwann cells (cells

HER3 overexpression, activation, and mutations
in cancer
HER3 plays an important role in cell proliferation
and survival [5]. HER3 was identified based on
its homology to EGFR [38, 39] and thereafter it
was determined that HER3 has an impaired kinase
function [40]. Neuregulin binding (NRG) to HER3
induces heterodimerization of HER3 with other EGFR
family receptors, particularly HER2, resulting in the
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the C-terminal
tail of HER3 [41]. Phosphotyrosines of HER3 provide
binding sites for PI3K, Shc and other HER3 interacting
proteins [42, 43], which mediate activation of the PI3K/
AKT and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways [44, 45]. Although
HER3 has been suggested to play a role in oncogenesis
for many years [46], its absolute significance in cancer
biology has begun to emerge in recent years [1, 10]. HER3

was initially studied in HER2 - amplified breast cancers
[46, 47]. HER3 was also detected in various cancers
under the conditions of acquired resistance to other HER
family member therapeutic interventions. For example,
a study established that resistance to the EGFR kinase
inhibitor gefitinib in lung cancer leads to amplification
of the MET proto-oncogene. This augmentation of the
MET proto-oncogene was due to the activation of HER3
phosphorylation and PI3K activation in an EGFR and
HER2 independent manner [48].
Overexpression of HER3 has been reported in
primary cancers and in cultured cells including the
carcinomas of breast, ovarian, prostate, colon, pancreas,
stomach, oral cavity and lung [11]. Studies have shown
that 50-70% of human breast cancers have detectable
HER3 levels as evaluated by IHC and activated HER3
is usually co-overexpressed with HER2 in breast cancers
[49-51]. Oncogenic mutations in HER3 gene were
reported in human colon and gastric cancers [52, 53]
and some of these mutations were shown to be gain of
function mutations. The study further provided evidence
of oncogenic activity with HER3 for Q809R in gastric
cancer [52]. Furthermore, although HER3 mutation at
V714M was identified in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients and S846I mutation was identified in
colon cancer, oncogenic function of these mutants has not
been tested [52].
Increased levels of HER3 mRNA in colon cancer
cell lines and colorectal tumors have been reported [54]
and HER3 expression can be detected in 30-90% of
colorectal tumors [55, 56] where HER3 is frequently
co-expressed with HER2 and EGFR [57]. Moreover,
signaling through EGFR and HER3 is thought to play a
role in colon cancer [2] and HER3 expression has been
shown to correlate disease progression in colon cancer
patients [58]. Furthermore, HER3 down regulation by
RNA interference and anti-HER3 antibody treatment led
to inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion,
G2-M cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in colon
cancer cell lines [58]. A recent study clearly demonstrated
that HER3 knockdown induces cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis of colon cancer cell lines by activation of Bak
and Bax [59].These studies collectively allude to the
critical involvement of HER3 in colon cancer progression
[58].
Similarly, other studies report that HER3 mRNA is
increased in some ovarian cancer [60] patients and 16%
of ovarian tumors show overexpression of HER3 protein
compared to normal ovarian samples [61]. Furthermore,
autocrine regulation of cell growth has been shown by
overexpression of HER3 ligand neuregulin (NRG) [62].
Direct correlation between HER3 overexpression and poor
overall prognosis of ovarian cancer has also been reported
[63].
Additional studies show HER3 overexpression (as
evaluated by IHC) is associated with poor prognosis of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lung adenocarcinoma [64] and with decreased survival of
patients with stage I-IIIA of NSCLC [65]. Constitutive
activation of HER3 is also observed in a number of
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that co-express HER2
[66]. HER3 transgenic mice also reveal the significance
of HER3 overexpression in lung tumorigenesis [67].
Furthermore, double transgenic mice with human HER3
and rat HER2 exhibit spontaneous lung tumors similar
to single transgenic mice, albeit a shorter latency period
thereby further demonstrates the involvement of HER2/
HER3 dimers in the initiation of lung carcinogenesis [67].
Among other cancers, high HER3 expression has been
reported in melanoma metastases using IHC staining [68]
and HER3 has been shown to be frequently expressed
in human melanoma cells [69]. Furthermore, using gene
expression microarray analysis, HER3 was one of the
small group of genes up regulated in melanoma [68].
Similarly, a study using microarray analysis has
shown increased expression of HER3 in prostate cancer
compared to a normal prostate [70] and further studies
using IHC reveal that 90% of human prostate cancer show
significant HER3 staining [71-73] therefore pointing to the
importance of HER3 signaling in prostate cancer.
A meta-analysis study linking HER3 overexpression
and survival in solid tumors (using the data from
immunohistochemistry) revealed the median percentage
of cancers with HER3 overexpression was 42.2% and
HER3 was associated with worse overall survival (OS) at
both the 3 year and the 5 year period [74]. These studies
collectively show involvement of HER3 in progression of
various cancers.

HER3 and resistance to cancer therapies
As mentioned earlier, HER3 activation is associated
with resistance to HER2 targeting tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in breast cancer [75, 76]. It has been shown
that HER3 and PI3K/AKT signaling escape the inhibition
exerted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the HER family
members. This is partly thought to be attributed to
a compensatory shift in the HER3 phosphorylationdephosphorylation equilibrium, driven by AKT mediated
negative feedback signaling [75]. Similarly, hepatoma
cells are able to overcome IGF1R inhibition through HER3
activation in an EGFR-dependent mechanism, suggesting
HER3 is an important mediator in acquired resistance to
anti-IGF1R therapy [77]. Studies have also shown that
HER2/HER3 heterodimers lead to aberrant activation
of androgen receptor, contributing to the development
of hormone resistant prostate cancer [78]. Furthermore,
EBP1, a HER3 binding protein acting as co-repressor of
androgen receptor (AR), has shown to be decreased in
hormone refractory prostate cancer [78]. Recent studies
have also shown that androgen-independent prostate
cancer cells modulate the expression of HER receptors
and ligands. This regulation of HER receptors sustains

the growth of cancer cells after the EGFR blockade, and
HER3 plays a central role in mediating such resistance
to EGFR inhibition [79, 80]. A recent study has shown
neratinib (pan HER inhibitor) is able to overcome
trastuzumab resistance in HER2 amplified breast cancer.
Furthermore, although neratinib decreased the activation
of all four HER receptors initially, HER3 and AKT
were reactivated in 24 hours. However, HER3 and AKT
were inhibited by the combination of trastuzumab and
neratinib [81]. Another study using antibodies against
HER3 and EGFR TKIs show the synergistic effect on cell
proliferation in vitro and the inhibition of tumor growth
in mouse xenograft models of non-small cell lung cancer
[82]. This synergistic effect suggests the combination
treatment of HER3 antibodies and EGFR TKIs is a
promising approach to pursue in the clinic.

present on the C-terminal tail that bind to the SH2 domain
of the regulatory subunits of PI3K [42, 43]. A previous
study reported the generation of several HER3 deletion
and Tyr-Phe mutations, and observed that a single YXXM
motif was necessary and sufficient for the association
of HER3 with p85 [44]. Another study demonstrating
the role of HER3 in the early stages of breast epithelial
transformation showed the loss of HER3 (Cre mediated
HER3 ablation) prevented the progressive transformation
of HER2, overexpressing mammary epithelium [91].
Further, the loss of HER3 impaired AKT and ERK
phosphorylation in pre-neoplastic HER2, overexpressing
mammary glands. The tumors which were rescued by reexpression of HER3 were only partially blocked by an
HER3 mutant (6 tyrosine to phenyalanine mutations),
blocking the interaction of HER3 to PI3K [91]. Another
study exploring the significance of HER3/PI3K in
mammary development generated a mouse model carrying
a mutant HER3 allele lacking 7 known PI3K binding sites
(ErbB3Δp85). Homozygous mice (ErbB3Δp85) of this study
further exhibited an early growth defect and impairment
of mammary epithelial outgrowth [92]. However, all
the female mutant mice developed metastatic HER2
induced mammary tumors, thereby suggesting although
HER3 associated PI3K activity is critical for mammary
development, it is not required for HER2 induced
mammary tumor progression [92]
Additional studies have shown HER3 is under the
regulation of several micro RNAs (miRNA) including
miR205, miR125a and miR125b [93, 94]. Micro RNAs
are known to regulate gene expression of many proteins
in cancer by either functioning as an oncogene or a tumor
suppressor gene. A study has shown miR205 directly
targets the HER3 receptor and inhibits AKT activation.
The same study showed the reintroduction of miR205 in
breast cancer cells was able to increase the TK inhibitors
responsiveness [93]. A recent study using bioinformatics
analysis showed miR205 binds to the 3’- untranslated
regions of human HER3 mRNA. Additionally, the
regulation of miR205 led to the reduction of HER3 protein
expression [95]. Similarly, overexpression of miR125a and
miR125b also suppressed HER2 and HER3 at both mRNA
and protein levels. Enforced expression of miR125a
and miR125b caused phenotypic changes (inhibition of
anchorage dependent growth, proliferation, migration and
invasion) in the tested breast cancer cells [94].
Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated
hyperglycemia leads to epigenetic up-regulation of the
NRG1 gene (HER3 ligand). NRG1-HER3 autocrine loop
activates HER3 signaling pathways, leading to more
malignant progression of tumor cells under hyperglycemia
(and even after a return to euglycemic conditions). These
results therefore suggested NRG-HER3 axis mediates
hyperglycemic memory effects in breast cancer [96].

Regulation of HER3
The regulation of HER3 at various levels is
depicted in Figure 1. The protein expression of HER3 is
modulated at transcriptional, post transcriptional and post
translational levels [3]. Regulation of HER3 expression
and signaling using HER3 interacting proteins such as E3
ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, Nrdp1 and Nrdp1 regulator USP
8 [83] has emerged from our recent studies [84] and reports
from other investigators [10, 83, 85, 86]. Additionally, we
[84] and others have used therapeutic HER3 antibodies
as probes to study the implication of HER3 inhibition/
down-regulation in preclinical models of human cancers
[2, 13, 87]. Our laboratory has demonstrated intracellular
domains/C-terminal tail of HER3 plays a key role in
dimerization of HER2/HER3 and in the activation of
downstream signaling pathways. This was achieved by
construction of HER3/HER2 chimeric receptors which
were engineered by replacing the HER3 kinase domain
(HER3-2-3) or by replacing both kinase domain and
C-terminal tail (HER3-2-2) with the HER2 counterparts.
Our results suggest intracellular domains play a crucial
role in establishing the function of HER3 as an allosteric
activator and its role in downstream signaling [88]. We
further reported an HER2 antibody which blocks HER2/
HER3 dimerization can induce ligand independent HER3
dimerization with EGFR in both low and high HER2
expressing cancer cells. Furthermore, our results suggest
HER3 plays an important role in sensing the perturbation
of HER2 signaling caused by HER2 antibodies and
in maintaining equilibrium of EGFR family mediated
signaling [80].
When phosphorylated, the 14-tyrosine residues
present on the C-terminal tail of HER3 are potentially
capable of docking numerous SH2 or PTB binding
proteins involved in a number of signaling pathways [3,
89, 90]. One of the most critically important signaling
activity of HER3 is its unique ability to activate PI3K/
AKT pathway by six consensus phospho tyrosine sites

disease relapse [111]. Our recent study identified E3 ligase
NEDD4 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally
down-regulated 4) as a novel interaction partner of HER3
[84].

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates
both normal and pathological cellular processes such as
proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis
[97]. Numerous studies have shown that the ubiquitinproteasome pathway plays a significant role in cancer
initiation and progression by regulating protein levels
and activities of both tumor promoting and suppressing
factors [98-104]. E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to
regulate EGFR family receptors [10]. For instance, the
E3 ligase Cbl associates with EGFR and, upon activation
with EGF and the interaction with Cbl, EGFR undergoes
lysosomal degradation [105]. Similarly, CHIP E3 ligase
associates with HER2 to promote its ubiquitination and
degradation [106]. Previous studies have reported that
an RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1 interacts with
HER3 and promotes HER3 ubiquitination and degradation
via proteasome in breast and prostate cancer cells [85, 107,
108]. Moreover, both WWP1 and ITCH E3 ligases were
shown to be involved in ubiquitination and degradation
of HER4 [109, 110]. Further, a recent study demonstrated
the enhancement of the chemotherapeutic response in
non-small cell lung cancer models by blocking NRG and
other ligand mediated HER4 signaling. This augmentation
implies the role of ligand-dependent HER4 signaling in

Role of NEDD4 and Nrdp1 in HER3 regulation
E3 ligase NEDD4 is a member of ubiquitinproteasome E3 ligase of the HECT family (homologous
to E6-AP COOH terminus). Similar to other reported
members in the family, NEDD4 contains a C2 domain
(N-terminal), 4 WW domains and a C-terminal HECT
domain [112-114]. The C2 domain of NEDD4 is a Ca2+dependent phospholipid binding domain [115], and it is
also involved in protein localization and trafficking [114].
The WW domains are involved in the substrate recognition
and specifically interact with the poly-proline type II helix
formed by the PPXY motif of the substrate [116-118].
The tyrosine (Y) in PPXY motif has been shown to form
hydrogen bonds with the WW domains, contributing to
the interaction between the substrate and NEDD4 [119]. A
recent study showed that NEDD4 mediated ubiquitination
and degradation of activated tyrosine kinase receptor
FGFR1, thereby regulating its endocytosis and signaling
[120]. Further, NEDD4 acts as an E3 ligase for epithelial
sodium channels to regulate its ubiquitination and
degradation [113, 121]. Another study reported NEDD4

as an E3 ligase for EGFR family member HER4 in MadinDarby canine kidney II cells [122].
Our recent studies demonstrated NEDD4 is a novel
interaction partner of HER3 and functions as an E3
ubiquitin ligase for regulation of the steady state levels
of HER3 [84]. Cancer cells with NEDD4 knockdown
(shRNA) exhibited increased HER3 levels that promoted
HER3 mediated signaling, cell proliferation and migration
as depicted in Figure 2. C-terminal tail of HER3 interacted
with the WW domains of NEDD4 in a neuregulin-1
independent manner. shRNA knockdown of NEDD4
elevated HER3 levels, resulting in increased HER3
signaling and cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo
in a MCF-7 mouse xenograft model. Further, an inverse
relationship between the HER3 and NEDD4 levels was
observed in ductal cells of prostate cancer tumor tissues.
In addition, up-regulated HER3 expression by NEDD4
knockdown sensitized cancer cells for growth inhibition
by an anti-HER3 antibody. This sensitization suggested
low NEDD4 levels may predict activation of HER3
signaling and therefore effectiveness of HER3 antibody
therapies [84]. Lack of biomarkers is a major obstacle in
early detection and treatment of various malignancies.

Therefore, biomarker validation for patient stratification
of molecular targeted therapies is of utmost clinical
importance and we speculate that NEDD4 may be a
responding marker for HER3 therapies.
Nrdp1 is a 317 amino acid protein that contains
“tripartite” motif consisting of an N-terminal RING
domain, two zinc finger domains (B-Box) and a coiledcoil segment [123]. Functionally, this class of E3 ligases
is involved in a number of cellular processes including
apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control
[124]. Nrdp1 has been shown to differentially ubiquitinate
various substrates including MyD88, Parkin, BRUCE,
HER3/ErbB3 and others [125] [126].
Previous studies show Nrdp1 also functions as an
E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate steady-state ErbB3 levels
by mediating its ligand-independent ubiquitination and
degradation. This was demonstrated by studies where the
overexpression of wild-type Nrdp1 suppressed cellular
ErbB3 levels, however, dominant negative Nrdp1 form
potently augmented the receptor levels [107, 108]. These
studies suggest that Nrdp1 constitutively internalizes
ErbB3 receptors to divert them from recycling to the
lysosomal degradation pathway [127]. Nrdp1 has been

levels of NEDD4 negatively regulate the steady-state levels of HER3 resulting in normal HER3, AKT1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
upon NRG-1 activation. Upon shNEDD4 knockdown increased HER3 levels and enhanced NRG-1 dependent HER3, AKT1 and ERK1/2
phosphorylation is observed. The increased HER3, AKT1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by NEDD4 knockdown can be neutralized
by an anti-HER3Mab.

shown to mediate ubiquitination of neuregulin induced
HER3 in breast cancer cells [83]. Additional study has
revealed overexpression of Nrdp1 in breast cancer cells
suppresses HER3 levels, cell proliferation, motility and
inhibition of signaling pathway [128]. Moreover, Nrdp1
protein is suppressed in approximately 60% of the
tumors compared to the patient matched normal tissues,
therefore showing a strong inverse correlation between
Nrdp1 and HER3 [128]. Further studies in prostate
cancer cells show androgen receptor (AR) regulates
HER3 levels by promoting its degradation by regulating
Nrdp1 transcription. Interestingly, AR regulates Nrdp1
levels transcriptionally in androgen-dependent but not in
castration resistant prostate cancer [85].
Furthermore, in addition to the lysosomal
degradation pathway, involving degradation of a mature
HER3 receptor, Nrdp1 preferentially associates with
nascent HER3 to mediate its degradation through
endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway
(ERDP). This phenomena was shown by the studies
where both Nrdp1 and HER3 proteins co-localized at the
endoplasmic reticulum [129]. ATPase VCP/p95 of the
ERDP was an essential component of the Nrdp1 mediated
HER3 degradation. This was represented by studies where
functional disruption of VCP led to Nrdp1 dependent
accumulation of ubiquitinated HER3 but blocked receptor

degradation. Collectively, these studies have proposed
a novel mechanism where Nrdp1by an ER-localized
degradation pathway regulates signaling-competent HER3
[129]. The authors have further proposed a model where
Nrdp1 could perform as a committed regulated component
into ERAD machinery to degrade HER3 when signaling
by receptor might be counterproductive.
Our recent study indicated NEDD4 knockdown [84]
of breast and prostate cancer cells did not impact Nrdp1
expression, which prompted us to speculate the two ligases
may interact with HER3 at different sites. Our results
further show NEDD4 interacts with the C-terminal tail
of HER3. In contrast, a previous study [130] has shown
Nrdp1 binds with HER3 either on the juxta-membrane
domain or kinase domain. Thus, our research suggests
that Nrdp1 and NEDD4 could regulate HER3 levels by
different mechanisms.

Targeting HER3 for cancer therapy – preclinical
models and clinical studies using antagonist
HER3 antibodies
As described below and shown in Figure 3, a
number of HER3 antagonist antibodies have been
evaluated in preclinical tumor models. More recently,

Figure 3: Regulation of HER3 expression and signaling using antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Various monoclonal

antibodies against HER3 which bind at various domains of HER3 (described in the text) to block HER3 function, cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion have been described. Some of HER3 monoclonal antibodies such as MM121 in clinical trials demonstrated that
targeting neuregulin-positive tumors with MM-121 sensitizes patients to exemestane, erlotinib and paclitaxel in metastatic breast, lung and
ovarian cancers, respectively, and significantly lowers their risk of tumor progression.

some of antibodies (most notably MM121) have also
been investigated in clinic against various types of cancer.
Studies have shown that monoclonal HER3 antibody
MM121 which targets ligand-dependent HER3 activation
[131] exhibits substantial tumor growth arrest against
various xenograft tumors including prostate (DU-145),
ovarian (OVCAR-8) and renal (ACHN) cancer [131133], albeit without inducing complete tumor regression.
The cause for lack of tumor regression by MM121 could
be attributable to the lack of dependence on HER3 or
the limited potency of MM121 towards activated HER3
[13]. Further, the importance of HER3/NRG autocrine
loop was established by demonstrating that both MM121
and HER3 targeted RNAi approaches slowed growth of
ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR8) cells in vitro and in vivo.
Although RNAi-targeted HER3 cells were able to cause
complete tumor regression compared to MM121 treatment
alone, suggesting single antibody treatment may not be
sufficient for tumor regression [133]. Recently presented
clinical trials with MM121 and tyrosine kinase inhibitors
and chemotherapeutic drugs show the mRNA expression
of neuregulin (NRG; HER3 ligand which binds to and
activates HER3) [134] is associated with poor response to
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, ER/PR+ HER2- breast
cancer and EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer
[135]. Furthermore, drug resistance to multiple standard
care therapies induced by neuregulin were active in ~3050 percent of patients tested, suggesting neuregulin-driven
HER3 signaling plays a significant role in promoting
resistance to multiple therapeutic agents. These studies
further demonstrate targeting neuregulin-positive tumors
with MM-121 sensitizes patients to exemestane, erlotinib
and paclitaxel in metastatic breast, lung and ovarian
cancers, respectively, and significantly lowers the risk
of tumor progression. These clinical studies therefore
identified neuregulin as a patient response biomarker for
MM-121. Furthermore, the clinical trials concluded that
patients with low HER2 exhibited the maximum benefit
from MM-121 (NCT00994123), (NCT01447225).
Another monoclonal antibody, LJM716, is
selective for an epitope on HER3 ECD (domains II
and IV). This antibody can lock HER3 in an inactive
conformation, thereby preventing both ligand-dependent
and -independent activation of HER3 [136]. Furthermore,
LJM716 antibody treatment resulted in significant growth
inhibition in various xenograft models of ligand-dependent
and ligand-independent modes of HER3 activation, with
more than 80% growth inhibition in the HER2+ BT474
xenograft [136]. Other ligand driven models such as FaDu
also showed significant in vivo growth inhibition with
LJM716 [136]. This antibody has recently completed
Phase I clinical trial in patients with squamous cell
carcinoma of head and neck or HER2+ breast cancer or
gastric cancer (NCT01598077).
AMG-888 (U3-1287), which targets ligand- induced
phosphorylation of HER3, has also been investigated for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

its anti-tumor activity against various models of breast
cancer and NSCLC [2, 137]. Preclinical studies with
U3-1287 demonstrate tumor inhibition in A549 model
and partial inhibition in FaDu model, suggesting the
antibody might be more effective against HER2+/EGFR+
amplified models relative to the NRG driven models.
Study of U3-1287 with erlotinib in patients with advanced
stage NSCLC has been completed with no study results
currently posted (NCT01211483). Further, there is an
ongoing Phase II clinical trial using U3-1287, trastuzumab
and paclitaxel in HE2+ breast cancer (NCT01512199).
AV-203 is a humanized IgG1 antibody that inhibits
ligand-dependent HER3 activation and its downstream
molecule AKT. AV-203 also shows potent tumor growth
inhibition in a number of xenograft models where HER3
is activated by ligand NRG1 or HER2 overexpression
[138]. This antibody is also currently in clinical trials for
advanced solid tumors (NCT01603979). Furthermore, TKA3 and TK-A4 (anti HER3 humanized antibodies) have
been investigated for their anti-tumor activity against
BxPC3 (pancreatic) and some genetically engineered
(GEM) models [87].
MM-111 is a bispecific antibody (targets both
HER2 and HER3) (developed by using computational
modeling) that forms trimeric complex with HER2 and
HER3 [139]. Furthermore, this antibody was shown
to potently and specifically inhibit HER3 signaling in
HER2 positive tumors. MM-111 exhibited antitumor
activity in preclinical models dependent on HER2
overexpression and the antibody was shown to exert
increased antitumor activity when combined with HER2
antibody trastuzumab or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
lapatinib targeting EGFR and HER2. Currently, a Phase I
clinical trial of MM-111 in combination with trastuzumab
is being conducted in patients with advanced, refractory
HER2 amplified and neuregulin positive breast cancer
(NCT01097460). In addition, another Phase I study of
MM-111 in combination with multiple treatment regimens
in patients with advanced HER2 positive solid tumors is
also being conducted (NCT01304784).
Similarly, a dual action monoclonal antibody
MEHD7945A targeting EGFR and HER3 was examined
in a number of xenograft models. Among the responders
were pancreatic (BxPC3) and NSCLC (NCI-H292 and
Calu-3) cell lines [140]. Furthermore, a recent study
showed that by antagonizing EGFR and HER3 using
MEHD7945A, an enhanced response to PI3K inhibitor
(GDC-0941) and AKT inhibitor (GDC-0068) in triple
negative breast cancer was observed. This response
therefore emphasized the concomitant blockade of EGFR,
PI3K and AKT pathway should be investigated in clinic
[141]. This antibody has also entered Phase I & II trials
for head and neck and metastatic epithelial cancers
(NCT01577173).
Previous studies indicated an aberrant activation
of IGFR in many cancers associated with HER targeted

therapies [77, 142]. These studies prompted the generation
of bispecific antibody MM-141 against HER3 and IGFR.
MM-141 has been shown to block binding of NRG to
HER3 and IGF1/2 binding to IGFR, causing inhibition of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pro-survival signaling in preclinical
cancer models [143]. Furthermore, MM-141 has been
proven to inhibit pancreatic tumor cell growth and
potentiate of effect of gemcitabine in various preclinical
models [144]. In addition, MM-141 has exerted its antiproliferative activity against melanoma [145], and this
antibody has also attenuated tumor growth and potentiated
the activity of mTOR inhibitor everolimus in mouse
models of anti-hormone therapy-resistant ER/PR+ breast
cancer [146]. Furthermore, previous studies with MM141 have shown the ablation of HER3 signaling results
in the inhibition of PI3K/AKT dependent mammary
carcinogenesis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in preneoplastic HER2 overexpressing mammary glands and
tumors [91, 147]. Patients are being currently recruited
for a Phase I clinical trial of MM-141 for advanced solid
tumors (NCT01598077).

SUMMARY
A recent meta-analysis study has revealed the
median percentage of cancers with HER3 overexpression
is over 40%. Furthermore, HER3 was found to be
associated with a lower overall survival rate after 3-5 year
period of initial diagnosis. Regulation of HER3 expression
and signaling by HER3 interacting proteins such as E3
ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, Nrdp1 and Nrdp1 regulator
USP-8 has emerged from our studies and from the studies
of other investigators. These studies suggest that both
NEDD4 and Nrdp1 regulate steady state levels of HER3
by proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, we and others
have used therapeutic HER3 antibodies as probes to study
the implication of HER3 inhibition/down-regulation using
NEDD4 and Nrdp1 KD preclinical models of various
human cancers. Recent clinical studies reveal that targeting
NRG-positive tumors with monoclonal antibody MM-121
sensitized patients to TKI and chemotherapeutic drugs
and significantly lowered their risk of tumor progression.
These clinical studies therefore identified neuregulin as a
patient response biomarker for MM-121. Taken together,
although there are several promising HER3 antibodies,
greater preclinical and possibly clinical benefits may be
attained by combining the HER3 antibodies with other
antibody and/or small molecule TKI inhibitors. Bispecific antibodies such as MM-111, MEHD7945A, and
MM-141 are also promising because of their capability
to simultaneously target HER3 and other partners of the
tyrosine kinase receptors HER family such as HER2,
EGFR, and IGF1R.
