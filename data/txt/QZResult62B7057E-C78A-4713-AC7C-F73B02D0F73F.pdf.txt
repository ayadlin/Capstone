Abstract
Estrogen has a central role in the genesis and progression of breast cancers whether they are positive or
negative for the estrogen receptor (ER). While therapies that disrupt estrogen biosynthesis or ER activity can treat
these diseases in postmenopausal women, in younger women where ovarian function remains intact, these antiestrogen therapies are not as effective. Moreover, emerging clinical evidence suggests that estrogen may promote
other cancers. Thus, circulating estrogens may participate in cancer pathogenesis in ways that are not yet
understood. In this study, we show that estrogen can promote the outgrowth of murine xenograft tumors
established from patient-derived ER-negative breast cancer cells by inﬂuencing the mobilization and recruitment
of a proangiogenic population of bone marrow–derived myeloid cells. ERa expression was necessary and
sufﬁcient in the bone marrow–derived cells themselves to promote tumor formation in response to estrogen. Our
ﬁndings reveal a novel way in which estrogen promotes tumor formation, with implications for the development
and application of anti-estrogen therapies to treat cancer in premenopausal women. Cancer Res; 72(11); 2705–13.

Introduction
A wealth of evidence indicates that the steroid hormone
estrogen contributes to the etiology and behavior of estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers; this has led to the
successes in anti-estrogen therapies for the standard treatment of ER-positive breast cancer (1). However, estrogen has
also been suggested to play a role in the genesis and behavior of
breast cancers that lack ER expression or express ER in very few
cells (2–4). Interestingly, anti-estrogen therapy has also been
used in the treatment of cancers not traditionally considered
hormone-responsive (e.g., lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, desmoid tumors, malignant glioma, pancreatic carcinoma,
melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma; refs. 5–7). The mechanism by which ER-negative tumors respond to anti-estrogen
treatment is unknown, but ER is abundantly expressed in many

stromal cells including endothelial cells, neurons, immune
cells, bone mesenchyme, adipocytes, and even breast ﬁbroblasts (8–13). Thus, it is highly plausible that estrogen can act
on these stromal cells in many tissues, which could foster a
microenvironment conducive for tumor growth.
All of the various physiologic actions of estrogen are thought
to be mediated through ERa and ERb, which function as
ligand-activated transcription factors (14). Much of the effects
of the ERs have been elucidated through examination of ER
knockout mice (ERKO). Both ERKOa and ERKOb mice have
been generated through germ line deletion of ERa and ERb
and, while viable, they display signiﬁcant reproductive abnormalities (8). In addition, ERKOa and ERKOb mice also have
defects in the cardiovascular, skeletal, and immune systems,
underscoring the importance of ER in the physiology of other,
nonreproductive, tissue types. Speciﬁcally, ERKOa mice are
defective in estrogen-induced angiogenesis, vascular wound
repair, and bone formation. They also exhibit a myeloproliferative disease and have alterations in neurologic behavior
(8–12).
Many solid tumors, including those of the breast, are associated with a strong stromal response characterized by the
inﬁltration of bone marrow–derived cells (BMDC; refs. 15, 16).
Recruited BMDCs contribute to tumor growth and wound
healing by providing epithelial cells with the growth factors
and cytokines to stimulate proliferation and by enhancing
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (17–20). Most immune cells,
including myeloid progenitors, monocytes, and macrophages,
express ER, suggesting that these cells are sensitive to estrogen.
However, it is not well understood which of these cells may
increase tumorigenesis in response to estrogen. In this study,

Stromal ER and Tumor Formation

we sought to determine the mechanism by which estrogen
promotes ER-negative tumor formation and whether this
activity is dependent on ERs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
SUM1315 cells were provided by Dr. Stephen Ethier (Karmanos
Institute, Detroit, MI) and cultured in Ham/F12 media supplemented with 5% calf serum (CS; Thermo Scientiﬁc Hyclone),
5 mg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL hEGF (Sigma), and
1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen). RAW264.7, DU4475, and
PC-3 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection. RAW264.7 and DU4475 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with
10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. PC-3 cells
were cultured in F12 supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen)
and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. All cell lines were grown at 37 C
and 5% CO2 and passaged for less than 3 weeks. All cell lines
were obtained in 2005 and tested negative for mycoplasma
(MilliPROBE; Millipore); however the identity of each cell line
was not authenticated in our laboratory.
Bone marrow transplantation and analyses
Bone marrow cells were ﬂushed from donor femurs, red
blood cells were lysed, and 5  106 bone marrow cells were
injected. Cells were injected into sublethally irradiated (3.50-Gy
g-radiation from a cesium source) mice by tail vein injection.
Reconstitution was conﬁrmed after 4 weeks by assaying the
percentage of GFPþ or red ﬂuorescent protein (RFP)þ cells in
the blood by ﬂow cytometry.
To quantitate leukocyte populations within the bone marrow, cells were incubated with conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Methods). Data were collected using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson) and analyzed using
FlowJo software (TreeStar, Inc.).
In vivo experiments
Matrigel plug and tumorigenesis assays were completed as
described in Supplementary Methods. GFPþ cells were FACSsorted (BD Inﬂux, Beckton Dickinson) and cytospun for
immunoﬂuorescence.
Histology and immunostaining
Immunoﬂuorescence was conducted on frozen sections of
tumors and Matrigel plugs (Supplementary Methods). Data
were blinded and quantiﬁed across 4 ﬁelds from each frozen
section (ImageJ).
Parafﬁn-embedded tumor tissues were stained for von
Willebrand factor (vWF; DAKO), hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E), and trichrome by the Histology Special Procedures
Laboratory at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) as previously
described (16).

Statistical analyses
For tumor incidence, the c2 test was conducted. All
other analyses were done using a 2-tailed Student t test.
The Fisher exact test was used for comparison of rates of
stable transplantation as xenografts with and without
estrogen pellets using primary human breast cancers
transplanted into the epithelium-free fat pad of SCID.Bg
mice.

Results and Discussion
We previously reported that estrogen promotes the
growth of human breast tumors that do not express either
ERa or ERb (16). This work showed that increased tumorigenesis in estrogen-treated mice was not due to a direct
inﬂuence of estrogen on the breast epithelial tumor cells
themselves. To exclude the possibility that this effect was
unique to the engineered and somewhat artiﬁcial cell
line used in this study, we examined whether estrogen
could promote tumor formation using other human cancer
cell lines that do not express ERa or that are insensitive
to the mitogenic effects of estrogen (SUM1315, DU4475,
PC-3 cells; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). In addition,
we conducted an interim statistical analysis of an ongoing
study using patient-derived primary breast tumors to
establish xenografts in which ER-positive and ER-negative
breast cancers were transplanted into the epitheliumfree mammary fat pad of mice, with (N ¼ 72) and without
supplemental E2 pellets (N ¼ 38). Consistent with our
previous ﬁndings, increasing the levels of circulating estrogen resulted in a marked acceleration of tumor growth
(Fig. 1). In patient-derived xenografts, supplementation
with 17b-estradiol (E2) had a signiﬁcant effect on increasing both primary outgrowth rates and increasing rates
of stable transplantation of ER-negative [and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative] xenografts (P ¼ 0.0002).
Only 1 of 20 (5%) ER-negative patient-derived tumors
successfully transplanted without E2 supplementation
yielding a stable xenograft whereas 17 of 31 (54.8%)
of ER-negative patients yielded a stable xenograft in the
presence of E2 supplementation (Fig. 1A). In contrast,
E2 supplementation had no effect on the rate of stable
transplantation of ER-positive human breast cancers
(0 of 18 ERþ patients transplanted without E2 supplementation vs. 1 of 41 ERþ patients transplanted with E2
supplementation, P ¼ 1.0). Likewise, ER-negative SUM1315
tumors grown in E2-treated mice showed a signiﬁcant
increase in tumor volume (P ¼ 0.001) and tumor weight
(P ¼ 0.002) compared with those in placebo-treated mice
(Fig. 1B). Similarly, E2 signiﬁcantly increased incidence
of ER-negative DU4475 tumors (P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 1B); 75%
(6 of 8) of tumors grew in E2-treated mice whereas only
14% (1 of 7) of tumors grew in placebo-treated mice.

Because tumors in all of these various models were insensitive to estrogen-mediated proliferation (Supplementary Fig.
S1), it was unlikely that E2 acted directly on the carcinoma cells
to promote tumor growth. An extensive body of clinical and
basic research has implicated estrogen (21) in promoting
physiologic angiogenesis through a variety of mechanisms
that operate independently of cancer growth. Therefore, we
examined the tumor microenvironment for evidence that E2
may be altering the composition of the stroma. H&E, Masson
trichrome, and staining for vWF conﬁrmed that tumors from
E2-treated mice showed increased matrix deposition, stromal
condensation, and angiogenesis (Fig. 1C). Immunoﬂuorescence conﬁrmed the recruitment of hematopoietic (CD45)
and smooth muscle/myoﬁbroblastic (aSMA) lineages within
the tumor-associated stroma of E2-treated mice (Fig. 1D).
Estrogen has been shown to mobilize bone marrow cells to
sites of tumor growth and angiogenesis (16, 22). To determine
which cells are recruited in response to E2, we used Matrigel
plug assays, which model wound healing and neoangiogenesis
(15, 16). We observed a 2.1-fold increase in the total number of
stromal cells (P ¼ 0.03) recruited in response to E2 as well as a
2.5-fold increase in the number of F4/80þ macrophages (P ¼
0.03) and a 2.3-fold increase in the number of CD31þ endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). To speciﬁcally address which BMDCs
were recruited, mice were transplanted with GFPþ bone
marrow cells and subcutaneously injected with Matrigel following conﬁrmation of bone marrow engraftment. Consistent
with these ﬁndings, we also observed an increase in the total
number of GFPþ BMDCs recruited to the Matrigel plugs; the
majority of these BMDCs were of the monocyte/myeloid
lineage (Fig. 2B). Although E2 supplementation increased the
total number of cells recruited to the Matrigel plugs, the
characteristics of the cells that were recruited were not signiﬁcantly different in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2B). Nearly all of
the GFPþ BMDCs were F4/80þ macrophages, with a subpopulation of 41% also expressing LYVE-1, consistent with an
activated macrophage phenotype (23). Hundred percent of
GFPþ BMDCs expressed ERa, whereas 89% of GFPþ cells also
expressed CD45 (Fig. 2B). Rarely did we observe differentiation
of the recruited BMDCs into endothelial, smooth muscle, or
myoﬁbroblastic cells (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2).
To examine the effect of E2 on BMDC recruitment in tumors,
mice were transplanted with GFPþ bone marrow cells and
orthotopically injected with DU4475 tumor cells. The resulting
tumor-associated stroma showed GFPþ BMDCs that
expressed ERa, CD45, and F4/80 but were negative for CD31
expression (Fig. 2C and D). Quantiﬁcation of sorted and
cytospun GFPþ BMDCs from tumors revealed that 78% of the
recruited cells were CD45þ and 89% were F4/80þ (Fig. 2D,
graph). Furthermore, we observed 2 distinguishable populations of F4/80þ macrophages that differed in LYVE-1 expression: LYVE-1þ macrophages localized at the periphery of the
tumor and LYVE-1 macrophages within the tumor mass (Fig.
2C). Non-BMDCs were also found within the tumor-associated
stroma: LYVE-1þ lymphatic endothelial cells that did not
colocalize with either GFP or F4/80 and GFP-negative aSMAþ
myoﬁbroblasts (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained using
the SUM1315 ER-negative tumor model (Supplementary Fig.

S3). These ﬁndings, combined with our previous observations
(16), reveal that estrogen accelerates the growth of ER-negative
tumors by changing the composition and nature of the tumor
microenvironment. Furthermore, these results suggest that E2
primarily promotes the recruitment of F4/80þ macrophages to
the stromal microenvironment at distant sites, particularly
those associated with stromalization/ﬁbrosis, angiogenesis,
and tumor formation.
On the basis of these ﬁndings, we examined the effect of E2
treatment on macrophage precursor cells within the bone
marrow. Although treatment of mice with E2 resulted in a
signiﬁcant upregulation of both ERa and ERb expression in
bone marrow cells (P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. S4), there
was a signiﬁcant decrease in cells from the myeloid lineage in
the bone marrow [P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 3A (ii)]. Speciﬁcally, there was a
signiﬁcant decrease in the (CD31/Gr1þþ) monocyte population (P ¼ 0.005) as well as a signiﬁcant increase in the (CD31þ/
Gr1) early blast population [P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 3A (iii)], suggesting
that the myeloid lineage is mobilized in response to increases
in circulating levels of E2.
To determine whether the response of the CD31/Gr1þþ
monocyte population to E2 was dependent on ERa or ERb, as
monocytes/macrophages express both ERa and ERb (Supplementary Fig. S5), we analyzed bone marrow from E2 or
placebo-treated wild-type (WT), ERKOa, and ERKOb mice by
ﬂow cytometry. There was a signiﬁcant reduction in the
proportion of CD31/Gr1þþ monocytes within the bone marrow of WT and ERKOb mice (P ¼ 0.001 and 0.003) in response
to E2 (Fig. 3B), which was not observed in ERKOa mice (Fig.
3B), suggesting that ERa is necessary for E2-mediated
mobilization.
To determine whether E2 can indeed increase macrophage
migration, RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with vehicle
(EtOH), bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 nmol/L E2, or membrane-impermeable E2 (BSA-E2). Both E2 and BSA-E2 significantly increased migration of cells compared with either
vehicle or BSA (P < 0.001 or P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 3C),
suggesting that E2 does increase migration of macrophages.
Given that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression
has been reported to be induced upon estrogen treatment and
mobilization of various cell types from the bone marrow is
dependent on MMP-9 secretion (24), we examined whether
mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow in response
to E2 was dependent on MMP-9 expression. Bone marrow from
E2 and placebo-treated MMP-9KO mice revealed a similar
depletion of CD31/Gr1þþ monocytes as compared with WT
mice (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3B), suggesting that the mobilization of
monocytes in response to E2 does not require MMP-9.
To determine whether ERa expression in the bone marrow
cells was necessary for the decrease in CD31/Gr1þþ population following E2 treatment, we conducted bone marrow
transplants (BMT) in WT mice. In WT mice transplanted with
WT bone marrow, treatment with E2 resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in the proportion of CD31þ/Gr1 early blast cells [P ¼
0.03; Fig. 3D (ii)] and a signiﬁcant decrease in the proportion of
monocytes [P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3D (iv)], consistent with ﬁndings in
nontransplanted WT mice. However, E2 treatment of WT mice
reconstituted with ERKOa bone marrow did not result in any

that ERa is critical in the recruitment of BMDCs for promotion

received BMTs from WT GFP or ERKOa GFP mice. ERnegative cancer cells were injected subcutaneously, and
mice were treated with E2. Although we were unable to
maintain viable ERKOa mice reconstituted with ERKOa
bone marrow, we found that tumors failed to grow in E2treated WT mice reconstituted with ERKOa bone marrow
(Fig. 4C), suggesting that ERa expression in bone marrow
cells was necessary for E2-mediated ER-negative tumor
growth. Tumor formation was comparable between ERKOa
mice transplanted with WT marrow and WT mice transplanted with WT marrow (Fig. 4C). Taken together,
these ﬁndings show that ERa expression in BMDCs, but

not non-BMD host cells, is necessary and sufﬁcient for E2mediated tumor promotion of ER-negative cancers.
This study provides evidence to support a novel role for
E2 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer through the mobilization of BMD monocytes to distant sites of angiogenesis
and early tumor formation. Upregulation of VEGF-A and/or
SDF1a is likely a mechanism underlying this response as
this is a well-established and documented downstream
mediator of E2/ER-induced angiogenesis and macrophage
chemotaxis, respectively (21, 25, 26). Until recently, the role
of estrogen in the formation of breast cancer has been
mainly attributed to its mitogenic, epigenetic, and genotoxic effects within ER-expressing breast cancer cells. This
has led to greatly improved therapy for patients with ERpositive breast cancer, but not for those in whom circulating estrogens remain high. On the basis of our ﬁndings,
estrogens could be affecting host tissues through a mechanism that involves recruitment of BMD monocytes to the
tumor microenvironment increasing the population of
locally activated macrophages. Through ERa, estrogen can
increase the inﬂammatory properties of tissue macrophages, an important cell type involved in the development
and progression of cancers (27). Macrophage recruitment
has been correlated with early relapse and poor prognosis
in patients with breast cancer (19). Furthermore, macrophage inﬁltration is required for the angiogenic switch, and
a failure to recruit macrophages delays angiogenesis and
subsequent tumor progression (18). Therefore, targeting
these cells or factors produced by these cells may improve

the treatment of breast cancers in patients with elevated
circulating estrogen.
