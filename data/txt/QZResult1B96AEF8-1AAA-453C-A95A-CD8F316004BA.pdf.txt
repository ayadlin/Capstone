Targeting BRCA1 Localization to Augment Breast Tumor
Sensitivity to Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibition

Abstract
PARP inhibitors have gained recent attention due to their highly selective killing of BRCA1/2-mutated and DNA
double-strand break (DSB) repair–deﬁcient tumors. Unfortunately, the majority of sporadic breast cancers carry
wild-type BRCA1/2 and are proﬁcient in DSB repair. We and others have shown that BRCA1 is a nuclear/
cytoplasm shuttling protein that is transiently exported from the nucleus to the cytosol upon various stimuli.
Thus, we hypothesized that depletion of nuclear BRCA1 would compromise DSB repair and subsequently render
sporadic tumors susceptible to PARP inhibition. Indeed, in human sporadic breast cancer cells with functional
BRCA1 and proﬁcient DSB repair, a transient nuclear depletion of BRCA1 and subsequent homologous
recombination repair deﬁcit was induced with either truncated BRCA1 or irradiation. This rendered these
human sporadic breast cancer cells susceptible to PARP inhibition. These observations were conﬁrmed
genetically using mislocated BRCA1 mutants as well as in vivo in mice bearing breast tumor xenografts. These
data support the potential strategy of targeting BRCA1 location to convert BRCA1-proﬁcient sporadic tumors to
be susceptible to the synthetic lethal combination with PARP inhibitors. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5547–55. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
PARP inhibitors induce synthetic lethality by targeting
homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair–deﬁcient tumors (1–3). However, this approach is only applicable
to about 10% of cancers. Thus, much effort has been undertaken to expand the use of PARP inhibitors beyond the realm of
BRCA-associated tumors by combining with agents that alter
the DNA damage/repair pathways. Indeed, PARP inhibitors
have been reported to enhance cytotoxicity in sporadic tumors
when combined with other DNA-damaging agents, such as
with platinum-based chemotherapy in breast cancer (4).
Unfortunately, these combinations have so far failed to be
efﬁcacious in clinical trials (5, 6). Thus, novel therapeutic
approaches are warranted.
We and others have previously shown that the tumor
suppressor BRCA1, a nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling protein,
is critical for DNA damage repair and induction of apoptosis.
The function of BRCA1 is regulated by a variety of mechanisms

including transcriptional control, phosphorylation, and protein–protein interactions (7). Its subcellular localization is
controlled by a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mediated
nuclear import via the importin receptor pathway and a
nuclear export signal (NES)-facilitated nuclear export through
a CRM1-dependent pathway (7). Importantly, cytoplasmic
relocalization of BRCA1 protein is one mechanism whereby
BRCA1 function is regulated in response to DNA damage.
We have previously shown that sequestering BRCA1 from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm compromises its nuclear function
in DNA repair and results in enhanced cytotoxic response to
ionizing radiation (IR) and other DNA-damaging agents (7–9).
Because PARP inhibitors have been reported to induce synthetic lethality in DNA repair–deﬁcient cells, we hypothesized
that inducing BRCA1 cytoplasmic translocation in sporadic
breast cancer, which generates a double-strand break (DSB)
repair deﬁciency, will confer enhanced cytotoxicity to the
PARP inhibitor ABT-888. Consistent with our hypothesis,
ectopic expression of truncated BRCA1 (tr-BRCA1) sequestered endogenous BRCA1 to the cytosol, suppressed HR-mediated DSB repair, and subsequently rendered human sporadic
breast cancer cells to become susceptible to the PARP inhibitor
ABT-888. These observations were conﬁrmed genetically using
mislocated mutants of BRCA1. Furthermore, as a potential
therapeutic strategy, we used IR to generate a transient depletion of nuclear BRCA1 and an HR repair deﬁciency. This
subsequently conferred breast tumor cytotoxicity to ABT888. Importantly, these ﬁndings were validated in mice bearing
breast tumor xenografts. These data support the potential
strategy of using radiotherapy to make BRCA1-proﬁcient
tumor cells susceptible to systemic DNA-damaging agents
such as PARP inhibitors. Furthermore, this novel strategy may
also be feasible in other tumor types.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF7 (HTB-22, American Type Culture Collection),
MCF7DRGFP, MCF7 cells stably expressing BRCA1 short hairpin
RNA (shRNA; obtained courtesy of Dr. Simon Powell, Memorial
Sloan Kettering, New York, NY) were used in this study. Please
refer to Supplementary Materials and Methods for details. The
genetic background, including expression and function of
key proteins as well as the growth characteristics and their
response to genotoxic agents, was tested most recently in
December 2011 using western blot analysis, immunohistochemical, and colony formation assays. The PARP inhibitor
ABT-888 (Enzo Life Sciences) was used in our study.
Plasmids
Tr-BRCA1 has been described previously (10, 11). Wild-type
(WT) BRCA1 YFP and NES-mutant BRCA1 YFP were kindly
provided by Dr. Beric Hendeson (Westmead Millennium Institute, New South Wales, Australia) and has been previously
described (12). NLS-mutant BRCA1 YFP was created using a
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) and had AA503-A506
mutation.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
BRCA1 location, Rad51, and DNA DSBs were assayed as
described previously (8–10, 13, 14).
Clonogenic survival assay
Cell survival was evaluated by the colony formation assay as
previously described (10).
Tumor growth delay
Tumor growth delay and immunohistochemical detection
of g-H2AX and BRCA1 were conducted as described previously
(8, 15). Please refer to Supplementary Methods for details. All
animal procedures were approved by the Vanderbilt University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Nashville, TN;
protocol M/08/154).
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed via ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni
posttest using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 (GraphPad Software). Data were presented as average  SEM.

Results
Targeting endogenous WT-BRCA1 to the cytosol using
tr-BRCA1 confers susceptibility to ABT-888 in breast
cancer cells
BRCA1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm through
the importin and CRM1 pathways, respectively (7, 16). It has
been shown that the protein BARD1 prevents BRCA1 export to
the cytosol through its binding to the NH2-terminal region of
BRCA1. This, in turn, masks the NES-BRCA1 and blocks BRCA1
interaction with CRM1/exportin (10, 16). Exogenous expression of the small peptide "tr-BRCA1," a truncated form (1–301
amino acids) of BRCA1 that contains the BARD1-binding site
and competes with endogenous full-length BRCA1 in binding

with BARD1, has been previously shown to effectively induce
BRCA1 cytoplasmic translocation (10). To target BRCA1 to the
cytosol, we transiently expressed tr-BRCA1 in MCF7 cells, a
well-characterized breast cancer cell line with WT-BRCA1 and
WT-p53 (7, 9, 10). Changes in BRCA1 location following trBRCA1 was subsequently determined by immunohistochemical staining. Similar to our previous studies (7, 9, 10), cells were
categorized into 3 groups on the basis of BRCA1 staining
pattern: strictly nuclear (N), strictly cytoplasmic (C), and mixed
nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (NC; refs. 9, 10). As shown
in Fig. 1A, expression of tr-BRCA1 alone in MCF7 cells effectively decreased endogenous nuclear BRCA1 by 2-fold compared with vector control (49% vs. 24%) with a concomitant 3fold increase in cytosolic fraction of BRCA1 (27% vs. 73%). This
suggests that tr-BRCA1 is effective in shifting BRCA1 to the
cytosol, away from its nuclear repair substrates.
Having veriﬁed that tr-BRCA1 could efﬁciently drive endogenous BRCA1 to the cytosol in MCF7 cells, we next conﬁrmed
its effects on HR-mediated DNA repair. MCF7 DRGFP cells,
which carry a single copy of a chromosomally integrated HR
repair substrate as described previously (7, 9) and in Fig. 1B,
were transiently transfected with tr-BRCA1 and subsequently
transfected with ISce-1 endonuclease, which generates a DSB
within the nonfunctional GFP gene. Only HR-mediated DSB
repair restores GFP function. Thus, GFP-positive cells, indicative of HR-mediated repair, were sorted for quantiﬁcation of
HR capacity. As shown in Fig. 1B, a 4-fold decrease in GFPpositive cells was observed in tr-BRCA1–transfected cells
compared with vector alone. These HR-mediated repair effects
were not due to differences in cell viability or transfection
efﬁciency, which were included as controls in all HR repair
assays. These results suggest that cytosolic translocation of
endogenous BRCA1 by tr-BRCA1 indeed induces a DSB repair
deﬁciency in breast cancer cells.
We next assessed cytotoxicity of MCF7 cells expressing trBRCA1 in combination with various doses (1–10 mmol/L) of
ABT-888 (13, 14). In these experiments, MCF7 cells were
transfected with either YFP-tr-BRCA1 or YFP and subsequently
sorted. Twenty-four hours later, they were exposed to various
doses of ABT-888. As shown in Fig. 1C, ABT-888 alone failed to
have any cytotoxic effect in vector-transfected cells whereas
those expressing tr-BRCA1 displayed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity to ABT-888.
We reasoned that compromised DNA repair by the expression of tr-BRCA1 would result in increased levels of persistent
DSBs. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1D, increased DSBs as evidenced
by persistent g-H2AX foci were observed in tr-BRCA1 expressing cells treated with ABT-888 compared with vehicle control
cells (24 hours after ABT-888 treatment, 70% vs. 5%, P < 0.001).
No signiﬁcant levels of g-H2AX foci were detected in vector
control cells with or without exposure to ABT-888 due to their
repair proﬁciency.
To substantiate that the main determinant of susceptibility
to PARP inhibition is the induction of DNA repair deﬁciency
from sequestering BRCA1 to the cytosol, we next used a
ﬂuorescent YFP-tagged NES-BRCA1 genetic mutant [mutation
at aa 86–90 (refs. 12, 17) and localized exclusively in the
nucleus]. Tr-BRCA1 failed to induce cytosolic translocation

Figure 1. tr-BRCA1 induced BRCA1 cytosolic translocation results in susceptibility to PARP inhibition. A, tr-BRCA1 targets endogenous BRCA1 to the cytosol.
MCF7 cells were transfected with either YFP or tr-BRCA1 YFP. BRCA1 distribution 24 hours following transfection was analyzed via immunohistochemical
staining. A dramatic increase in cytosolic BRCA1 with a concomitant decrease in nuclear BRCA1 was observed in tr-BRCA1–transfected cells compared with
vector alone. Top, a representative image of MCF7 cells exhibiting nuclear (N), both nuclear and cytosolic (NC), and cytosolic (C) BRCA1. Representative data

C, tr-BRCA1 augments breast tumor susceptibility to PARP inhibition. MCF7 cells were transfected with YFP or tr-BRCA1 YFP. Sixteen hours following
transfection, YFP-positive cells were sorted via ﬂow cytometry and reseeded for colony formation. Twenty-four and 48 hours following transfection, cells were
exposed to various doses of ABT-888. ABT-888 signiﬁcantly attenuated the colony formation ability of tr-BRCA1–expressing MCF7 breast cancer cells
compared with vehicle alone. In contrast, no signiﬁcant effect on cell viability was observed in vector (YFP)-transfected cells. Representative data of at
least 3 independent experiments are shown (mean  SEM;   , P < 0.001). D, tr-BRCA1 increases g-H2AX foci in human breast cancer cells. MCF7 cells were
transfected with either YFP or tr-BRCA1 YFP. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were exposed to 10 mmol/L ABT-888. Twenty-four hours
following the treatment period, cells were assessed for g-H2AX foci. A signiﬁcant induction in g-H2AX foci formation, indicative of DSB damage, was observed
in tr-BRCA1–expressing cells compared with vector alone. Representative data of 3 independent experiments, the percentage of cells (mean  SEM) with

at aa 503–506) is localized in the cytosol (12, 17). These
plasmids were transiently transfected into MCF7 BRCA1
shRNA cells in which the endogenous WT-BRCA1 has been
depleted through stably expressing BRCA1 shRNA. BRCA1
location was assessed 48 hours following transfection by
staining cells for YFP as a surrogate for BRCA1, as the constructs were YFP tagged. Cells were scored as above. As
shown in Fig. 2A, compared with cells expressing WT-BRCA1,
cells expressing the NLS-BRCA1 mutant had predominantly
cytosolic BRCA1 (87%). Conversely, NES-BRCA1 mutant
transfected cells had predominantly nuclear BRCA1 (82%).
Furthermore, the shuttling response of these BRCA1 mutants
following IR was also assessed (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Similar to our previous observations (7), IR effectively

decreased nuclear WT-BRCA1 by 2-fold compared with
mock-radiated control (47% vs. 19%) whereas concomitantly
increasing cytosolic BRCA1 (24% vs. 56%). In contrast, the NESBRCA1 and NLS-BRCA1 failed to show any signiﬁcant redistribution following IR.
On the basis of these results, and given the central role of
BRCA1 in promoting the repair of DSBs, we next assessed
whether the location mutants of BRCA1 similarly altered HRmediated DSB repair capacity of cells. We ﬁrst analyzed Rad51
foci, a well-established functional marker of HR repair activity.
It has been shown that accumulation of DNA single-strand
breaks (SSB) will be converted to DSBs during DNA replication.
Cellular attempts to repair these DSBs lead to induction of HRmediated repair and Rad51 foci. We thus reasoned that treatment with ABT-888 should induce HR repair in cells expressing

Figure 2. BRCA1 location determines ABT-888–induced cytotoxicity. A, BRCA1 location mutants are located predominantly either in the nucleus or in the
cytosol. MCF7 BRCA1 shRNA cells were transfected with either WT-BRCA1 YFP, NLS-BRCA1 YFP (cytosolic BRCA1) mutant, or NES-BRCA1 YFP (nuclear
BRCA1) mutant. BRCA1 distribution was analyzed via immunohistochemical staining for YFP. NES-BRCA1 mutant was exclusively located in the nucleus,
whereas NLS-BRCA1 mutant was located in the cytosol. Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown (mean  SEM;   , P < 0.001).
B, cytosolic BRCA1 mutant abrogates HR-mediated DSB repair. Sixteen hours following transfection with the various BRCA1 mutants, MCF7 BRCA1 shRNA
cells were exposed to 10 mmol/L ABT-888. Twenty-four hours following the drug treatment, Rad51 foci levels were analyzed via immunohistochemistry.
A robust induction in Rad51 foci was observed in WT-BRCA1 and NES-BRCA1 mutant cells. No signiﬁcant induction in foci formation was observed in
the NLS-BRCA1 mutant or the vector alone, indicative of deﬁcient HR-mediated repair. Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown as the

of ABT-888. ABT-888 signiﬁcantly attenuated the colony-forming ability of NLS-BRCA1 mutant expressing breast cancer cells compared with vehicle alone. In
contrast, no signiﬁcant increase in cytotoxicity was observed in WT-BRCA1 and NES-BRCA1 mutant expressing cells. Representative data of at least 3
independent experiments are shown (mean  SEM;   , P < 0.001). D, absence of BRCA1 or cytosolic BRCA1 increases g-H2AX foci in human breast cancer
cells. MCF7 BRCA1 shRNA cells were transfected with the various mutants of BRCA1. Forty hours following transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or 10
mmol/L ABT-888. Twenty-four hours following the treatment period, cells were assessed for g-H2AX foci. A robust induction in g-H2AX foci was observed with
ABT-888 treatment in the NLS-BRCA1 mutant or vector expressing cells, indicative of increased DNA damage. On the contrary, no signiﬁcant induction in foci
formation was observed with ABT-888 treatment in the NES-BRCA1 mutant or WT-BRCA1–expressing cells, indicative of lack of DNA damage.
Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown as the percent of cells (mean  SEM) with more than 10 foci (  , P < 0.001).

with NES-BRCA1 mutant or vector control, sorted for YFP, seeded and exposed to mock or 4 Gy IR treatment 24 hours following transfection. Twenty-four and
48 hours following the treatment period, cells were exposed to various doses of ABT-888. Three-fold attenuation in the colony-forming ability of IR-exposed
MCF7 breast cancer cells was observed following ABT-888 treatment compared with vehicle alone. In contrast, no signiﬁcant effect on cytotoxicity was
observed in the NES-BRCA1 mutant transfected or mock-radiated cells. Representative data of at least 3 independent experiments are shown
(mean  SEM;   , P < 0.001). D, nuclear BRCA1 abrogates radiation-induced HR defect in human breast cancer cells. MCF7 cells were transfected with NESBRCA1 mutant. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were exposed to 4 Gy radiation. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with
or without ABT-888. Twenty-four hours following the drug treatment, Rad51 foci levels were analyzed via immunohistochemical staining as a surrogate marker
for HR-mediated DSB repair. A robust induction in Rad51 foci was observed in NES-BRCA1 mutant cells, which showed signiﬁcant nuclear BRCA1.
Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown as the percent of cells (mean  SEM) with Rad51 foci (  , P < 0.001). E, radiation increases PARP
inhibition–induced g-H2AX foci in human breast cancer cells, whereas the NES-BRCA1 mutant abrogates this effect. MCF7 cells were transfected
with NES-BRCA1 mutant, sorted, and treated with either mock or 4 Gy IR 24 hours following transfection. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were
exposed to 10 mmol/L ABT-888. Twenty-four hours following the treatment period, cells were assessed for g-H2AX foci. A robust induction in g-H2AX foci was
observed with the combination treatment of ABT-888 and IR when compared with vehicle alone. On the other hand, no signiﬁcant induction in foci
formation was observed with ABT-888, IR treatment alone, or in the NES-BRCA1 mutant transfected cells. Representative data of 3 independent experiments
are shown as the percent of cells (mean  SEM) with more than 10 foci (  , P < 0.001).

the nuclear-localized BRCA1 isoforms (NES-BRCA1, WTBRCA1) but not in cells with cytoplasmic BRCA1 (NLS-BRCA1).
Consistent with our hypothesis, no signiﬁcant levels of Rad51
foci–positive cells were detected in the vector or NLS-BRCA1
mutant cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, WT-BRCA1–transfected
cells displayed elevated levels of Rad51 foci following exposure
to ABT-888, indicative of activated HR-mediated DSB repair
(1% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained in NESBRCA1 mutant expressing cells following exposure to ABT-888
(1% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). ABT-888–induced Rad51 foci were also
potentiated with IR in the WT- and NES-BRCA1 but not the
NLS-BRCA1–expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Furthermore, it was observed that after IR, the enhanced RAD51
foci in response to PARP inhibition was more robust in the
NES-BRCA1 compared with WT-BRCA1–expressing cells,
which correlates closely with the amount of BRCA1 being
retained in the nucleus following IR. These results substantiate
the observation that nuclear BRCA1 is required to activate HRmediated repair and that targeting BRCA1 location can disrupt
HR-mediated DSB repair.
On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that
expressing the NLS-BRCA1 mutant (cytosolic BRCA1), but
not NES-BRCA1 mutant (nuclear BRCA1), in the MCF7
BRCA1 shRNA cells will result in synthetic lethality with
ABT-888. To test this hypothesis, we conducted colonyforming assays with the various mutants in combination
with various doses (1–10 mmol/L) of ABT-888. IR was used as
a positive control with WT-BRCA1–expressing MCF7 cells.
As shown in Fig. 2C, ABT-888 failed to induce any cytotoxicity in WT-BRCA1–expressing cells. Signiﬁcantly increased
levels of ABT-888–induced dose-dependent cell death were
observed in the NLS-BRCA1 mutant–expressing cells that
express predominantly cytosolic BRCA1. No ABT-888–
induced cytotoxicity was observed in the MCF7 NES-BRCA1
mutant cells, which have nuclear accumulation of BRCA1.
These results validate genetically that targeting BRCA1
location to the cytosol can augment tumor susceptibility
to PARP inhibition via an induced DSB repair deﬁcit.
Because PARP-induced cytotoxicity is mainly attributed to
persistent DSBs, we next assessed DNA DSBs in treated cells
expressing the various BRCA1 location mutants. As shown
in Fig. 2D, in the vector alone transfected cells, signiﬁcantly
increased persistent DNA damage was observed 24 hours
following ABT-888 treatment as shown by increased percentage of cells with g-H2AX foci. This is consistent with a DSB
repair deﬁciency due to absence of functional BRCA1. Similarly, a signiﬁcantly increased persistent DNA damage was
observed in the NLS-BRCA1 mutant expressing cells, which are
deﬁcient in HR repair due to cytosolic BRCA1. On the contrary,
WT-BRCA1 or NES-BRCA1 mutant expressing cells failed to
display increased persistent DNA damage following treatment
with ABT-888, likely due to proﬁcient HR repair. However,
following IR, ABT-888–induced g-H2AX foci were potentiated
in the NLS-BRCA1 and WT-BRCA1 but not NES-BRCA1–
expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These results indicate that ABT-888–induced cytotoxicity following IR is due to
persistent DNA damage from a DNA repair deﬁciency caused
by altered BRCA1 location.

Radiation-induced cytosolic translocation of BRCA1
induces susceptibility to ABT-888 in WT-BRCA1 breast
cancer cells
Our results thus far support the notion that targeting
BRCA1 to the cytoplasm induces a DNA repair defect and
subsequent susceptibility to ABT-888. As a potential clinical
application of this novel ﬁnding, we hypothesized that IR,
which we have reported to induce BRCA1 nuclear export
(10, 16), will induce synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition
(7, 10). To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst analyzed BRCA1
location via immunohistochemistry at various time points
following 4 Gy IR in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Indeed, IR
induced BRCA1 cytosolic translocation in MCF7 cells in a
time-dependent manner, with a 2-fold decrease in nuclear
BRCA1 compared with mock-radiated control (40% vs. 20%)
and a concomitant increase in cytosolic BRCA1 (25% vs.
50%). The maximal shift was observed at 24 hours following
IR (Fig. 3A). Next, we veriﬁed whether IR-induced decrease
in nuclear BRCA1 compromises HR-mediated DSB repair
capacity in MCF7DRGFP cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, 4 Gy IR
resulted in a 2-fold decrease in HR repair efﬁciency (P <
0.001). Importantly, these effects on HR repair were not due
to indirect changes in cell-cycle distribution (Supplementary
Fig. S3A–S3D). Interestingly, NES-BRCA1 mutant rescued IRinduced reduction in HR-mediated repair reafﬁrming that IR
can induce a transient DNA repair deﬁcit by depleting
nuclear BRCA1.
Our results thus far suggest that IR induces BRCA1
nuclear export and subsequently decreases HR-mediated
DSB repair. We next tested whether IR can induce synthetic
lethality with ABT-888 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. As
shown in Fig. 3C, after normalizing for IR-induced toxicity,
a differential dose-dependent susceptibility to IR and ABT888 was observed in MCF7 human breast cancer cells (3-fold
reduction in cell viability with combination treatment). As
expected, treatment with the inhibitor alone failed to show
any cytotoxic effect due to proﬁcient HR repair. Furthermore, the NES-BRCA1 mutant, which is not exported following IR, abrogated synthetic lethality of IR and PARP
inhibition.
We next hypothesized that the mechanism of synthetic
lethality involved attenuation of HR by IR. Rad51 foci levels
were analyzed via immunohistochemical staining as a surrogate marker for HR-mediated DSB repair in NES-BRCA1
mutant cells. As anticipated, a robust induction in Rad51
foci was observed in NES-BRCA1 mutant cells, which
showed signiﬁcant nuclear BRCA1, whereas no signiﬁcant
induction was observed in the WT-BRCA1 cells (Fig. 3D).
We also examined whether cells exposed to IR exhibit either
increased levels of or persistent ABT-888–induced DSBs by
assaying levels of g-H2AX foci (13, 14, 18). A signiﬁcant increase
in unrepaired DSBs was observed in cells treated with ABT-888
and IR, as shown by increased percentage of cells with g-H2AX
foci (Fig. 3E) but, importantly, persistent g-H2AX foci were not
observed in the NES-BRCA1 mutant. These results indicate
that IR-induced BRCA1 nuclear export creates a DSB repair
deﬁciency, which results in increased levels of persistent DSBs
in treated cells.

Figure 4. Cytosolic BRCA1 confers susceptibility to PARP inhibition in vivo. A, radiation induces signiﬁcant tumor growth delay in combination with ABT-888 in
vivo. MCF7 tumor–bearing female athymic Foxn1 (nu/nu) mice were randomized into 4 treatment groups (n ¼ 3): control, IR (3 Gy, single dose at day 0), ABT888 (25 mg/kg daily beginning at day 1, for 5 consecutive days), IR þ ABT-888. Tumor size was measured for 21 days following which mice were sacriﬁced and
tumor collected. Shown is the tumor volume (mean  SEM) over time. The combination treatment of ABT-888 and IR induced a signiﬁcant delay in tumor
growth when compared with either agent alone. B and C, breast tumor tissues show increased markers of DNA damage following the combination treatment of
ABT-888 and IR. B, MCF7 xenografts harvested 24 hours after IR were ﬁxed in 10% formalin and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Increased
accumulation of mitotic ﬁgures (black arrows) was observed in irradiated samples. Boxed areas are shown at higher magniﬁcation below each corresponding
panel. C, MCF7 xenografts harvested 24 hours after ﬁnal treatment were formalin-ﬁxed and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Mitotic ﬁgures
(black arrows) were evident in untreated samples and were infrequently seen in ABT-888–treated tumors but were not found in tumors treated with IR.
Apoptotic bodies (white arrows) were found in IR- and ABT-888–treated samples but were more predominant in xenografts treated with combination of IR þ
ABT-888. Increased collagen scarring was also observed in these tumor environments, consistent with drastically reduced tumor cellularity. Representative
images for each treatment group are shown. Inset, magniﬁed image of the boxed tumor ﬁeld in each panel. D, radiation induces BRCA1 cytosolic translocation
in MCF7 tumor xenografts. BRCA1 distribution 24 hours following exposure to 4 Gy IR was analyzed in MCF7 breast cancer tissues via immunohistochemical
staining. A dramatic increase in cytosolic BRCA1 with a concomitant decrease in nuclear BRCA1 was observed in tissue obtained from irradiated mice
compared with mock IR. Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown (mean  SEM;   , P < 0.001). E, combined ABT-888 and radiation
treatment increases the level of persistent DSBs in tumor xenografts in vivo. g-H2AX foci levels were analyzed 24 hours following exposure to 4 Gy IR in MCF7
breast cancer tissues via immunohistochemical staining. A dramatic increase in g-H2AX was observed in tissue obtained from irradiated mice treated with
ABT-888 compared with either agent alone. Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown (mean  SEM;  , P < 0.001).

Targeting BRCA1 location with radiation delays tumor
growth in breast cancer tumor xenografts
We next validated our intriguing observations in vivo in mice
bearing MCF7 breast cancer xenografts. Tumors were exposed
to 3 Gy or mock IR on day 0. Beginning on day 1, tumor-bearing
mice were then treated with or without ABT-888 (25 mg/kg
daily) for 5 days, at which point treatment ceased and tumors
were followed through day 21. Consistent with results observed

in cell culture, tumor growth was modestly inhibited upon
treatment with either IR alone or ABT-888 alone as compared
with mock-treated mice. However, growth of tumors treated
with IR followed by 5 days of PARP inhibition was profoundly
reduced as compared with untreated tumors or those treated
with either agent alone (Fig. 4A).
In addition, accumulation of mitotic ﬁgures was observed at
24 hours after IR (Fig. 4B). These are indicative of DNA damage

and typically precede mitotic catastrophe and cell death (19).
By 6 days, IR-treated tumors displayed no mitotic ﬁgures but
abundant apoptotic bodies (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, mitotic
ﬁgures did not accumulate in tumors treated with ABT-888.
Furthermore, apoptotic bodies were more predominant in IR
þ ABT-888–treated tissues than what was seen in response to
either agent alone. Increased collagen scarring was also apparent in IR-treated tumors but was increased in tumors treated
with IR þ ABT-888, consistent with drastically reduced tumor
cellularity.
Similar to our in vitro results, increased cytosolic BRCA1 was
observed in tumors obtained from mice irradiated with 3 Gy IR
(Fig. 4D, P < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore, 2fold increase in the level of unrepaired residual DNA DSBs was
observed in these tumors treated with combination of IR þ
ABT-888, as measured by the amount of cells with persistent
g-H2AX foci (Fig. 4E, P < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. S4B). Thus,
these in vivo results validate the role of BRCA1 location as a
mechanism by which tumors can be rendered susceptible to
PARP inhibition.

Discussion
BRCA1 is a nuclear shuttling protein that is essential in
maintaining genomic stability and controlling the cellular
response to genotoxic stress. Precise regulation of these
BRCA1 functions is vital from an oncologic and cell survival
perspective. One emerging target is BRCA1 localization and
shuttling, as sequestration of BRCA1 away from the nucleus
may switch BRCA1 function from repair in the nucleus to
activation of cell death signals in the cytoplasm. When
nuclear, BRCA1 controls high ﬁdelity repair of damaged
DNA. In contrast, BRCA1 has been shown to enhance
p53-independent apoptosis when cytoplasmic (8, 16). Interestingly, we have also previously reported that cytosolic
translocation of BRCA1 and subsequent accumulation in
the cytosol controls its DNA repair functions and regulates
cell death processes following DNA damage (10). These data
point to other potential mechanisms in addition to an
induced DNA repair deﬁcit that may explain the enhanced
cytotoxicity to PARP inhibition following IR-mediated
BRCA1 nuclear export, including the potential role of cytosolic BRCA1 in augmenting cell death pathways as well as
other cytosolic functions of BRCA1.
Recent studies support the existence of a BRCAness phenotype in sporadic breast cancers, such as the highly aggressive
triple-negative subtypes, without a BRCA mutation. This has
been thought to confer sensitivity of PARP inhibitors (20–23).
Whether this BRCAness phenotype involves aberrant localization of BRCA1 is an interesting question and warrants
further investigation.
BRCA1 shuttling can be regulated via protein–protein
interaction (24, 25). The BRCA1-associated RING domain
protein (BARD1) binds and masks the NES- BRCA1 located
at the N-terminal RING domain, thereby preventing nuclear
export of BRCA1 (16, 17). By altering the interaction between
BRCA1 and BARD1 with tr-BRCA1, we rendered breast
cancer cells susceptible to PARP inhibition by effectively

5554

Cancer Res; 72(21) November 1, 2012

shifting BRCA1 to the cytosol (8–11, 16, 17). Finding the
minimal region of tr-BRCA1 that can induce BRCA1 nuclear
export could lead to the discovery of novel compounds that
could augment tumor cytotoxicity to PARP inhibition in
tumors. We and others have also reported the requirement
of wild-type p53 on IR-, but not tr-BRCA1–induced BRCA1
cytosolic sequestration (7, 8, 10). Thus, with respect to the
sensitization of sporadic breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition by targeting BRCA1 location, further preclinical investigation and consideration in clinical studies are needed to
determine the role of p53 in this strategy.
In this study, IR was used to generate a DNA repair deﬁcit.
This is at ﬁrst glance counterintuitive, as IR is a potent inducer
of immediate DNA repair response. It is important to note that
the repair deﬁcit generated by IR was measured at a time well
after repair of IR-induced DSBs had occurred. Because BRCA1
export is a later DNA damage response event, our repair assays
were not conducted until 24 hours following IR. These data
also indicate that the timing and sequence of treatment are
important to achieve IR-induced tumor sensitization to PARP
inhibition.
Our report suggests that BRCA1 cytoplasmic translocation
can be a potential surrogate marker to predict tumor response
to PARP inhibitor–based therapy. This is substantiated by our
freshly resected human breast cancer specimen ex vivo results
(data not shown) that show IR-induced BRCA1 cytoplasmic
translocation. Further investigation is necessary to validate
this method as a potential predictor of PARP inhibitor sensitivity following IR.
