BACKGROUND: This study evaluated self-reported knowledge, practice, and attitudes toward commercially available cytochrome
P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) pharmacogenomic testing for patients on tamoxifen for breast cancer (CYPT) among US oncologists while
evidence for the use of the test was evolving. METHODS: A self-administered survey of medical oncology breast cancer specialists at
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCNO) centers and a random sample of community-based oncologists (CBOs) was
undertaken. The survey evaluated knowledge and use of the CYP2D6 test and response to hypothetical test results. RESULTS: In total,
201 of 459 (44%) oncologists responded. At a time when CYPT remained experimental, 31% of oncologists reported use of CYPT and
56% reported willingness to order CYPT outside of a clinical trial if requested by a patient. Compared to oncologists specializing in
breast cancer, oncologists in community-based practice were more likely to use CYPT routinely (21% versus 11%, P <.06), to order
CYPT on patient request (66% versus 44%, P <.001), and to change management for premenopausal women with intermediate
metabolism (34% CBO versus 8% NCCN, P <.001). Oncologists cited data from randomized trials and professional guidelines as most
influential when considering use of a genetic test. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to definitive evidence, a minority of oncologists reported
using the CYP2D6 test routinely, and many indicated willingness to change management of patients based on test results. There is a
need to educate clinicians and the public regarding the uncertain benefits of commercially available genetic tests in clinical practice

INTRODUCTION
Advances in genetics and molecular biology are leading to an increasing number of novel tests to diagnose and treat cancer
and many other medical conditions. Some tests may become commercially available while clinical evidence to guide their
use in practice is still emerging. Availability of promising but experimental genetic tests for use in routine clinical practice
raises questions related to potential clinical harm and benefit, informed consent, and equity in access.
One area of oncology research where this presents a growing challenge is the field of pharmacogenomics, in which
genetic variation in drug metabolism is evaluated to understand predictors of response and toxicity, and to guide personalization of cancer therapy.1 Pharmacogenomics holds the promise of identifying those patients who will most benefit from
a drug, and those patients who would be best served by treatment with a different therapy, potentially improving outcomes
and reducing toxicity. However, this promise must be tempered by the need to validate the pharmacogenomic test through
well-designed clinical trials and to conclusively demonstrate the association between genotype and outcome before use in
clinical practice.
A prime example of both the promise and the challenge of the potential therapeutic application of pharmacogenomics in recent years has been the evolving role of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) test for tamoxifen metabolism. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor-modulating agent, is one of the most commonly used medications for
breast cancer treatment and prevention. However, tamoxifen is not effective in all patients, and reasons for progression
of disease, recurrence, or development of a new breast cancer despite tamoxifen therapy are not completely
understood.

Original Article

Genetic differences in metabolism of tamoxifen to
the more potent estrogen receptor antagonist, endoxifen,
mediated by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 (in addition to
other enzymes) were believed to potentially play a role in
determining efficacy and outcomes among patients.2,3
Roughly 10% of patients in most population-based studies can be characterized as genetically “poor metabolizers”
(PM), generating very little endoxifen, compared to
roughly 50% of the population who are classified as
“extensive metabolizers” (EM), and the remaining 40% as
those with intermediate metabolism (IM).4 Multiple
studies have examined the role of genetic differences in
CYP2D6 in determining breast cancer outcomes
with conflicting results.5 In addition, 2 recent large retrospective studies suggested no clear association between
CYP2D6 genotype and outcome.6,7 Although this
remains an area of active clinical investigation, there is no
clear role for use of this test outside of a clinical trial at this
time.8,9
As this scientific story evolved, the genetic test for
CYP2D6 genotype remained commercially available. The
Roche AmpliChip CYP450 Test was approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 and a
number of other labs offered CLIA-licensed CYP2D6
testing. Although deemed investigational by most insurance companies, the test was available at the time of this
survey for less than $500. The test could be ordered in
routine practice, patients could obtain the test themselves
(as a buccal swab) without physician involvement, and
consideration of routine testing was discussed at national
oncology meetings.10 At the time of this survey, the test
was experimental but available outside of clinical trials
and subject to direct-to-consumer advertising.
The extent of oncologist awareness of the CYP2D6
tests, familiarity with the evidence, and clinical practice
regarding testing during this period of evolving evidence
is unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the use of
this test outside of clinical trials and the attitudes of
community-based oncologists (CBOs) and breast cancer
specialists with regard to CYP2D6 testing among patients
with breast cancer eligible for tamoxifen therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In 2009, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional
self-administered mailed survey of practice and attitudes
toward CYP2D6 testing for tamoxifen metabolism
(CYPT) outside of clinical trials among all breast cancer
medical oncologists affiliated with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCNO) and a random sample of CBOs identified from the American Society of
3704

Clinical Oncology (ASCO) directory. The survey evaluated knowledge of the CYP2D6 test, use of the test outside of trials, requests for the test by patients and third
parties, and response to hypothetical test results. Associations between practice setting and CYP2D6 knowledge,
CYPT, and practice patterns were evaluated.
A study-specific survey consisting of 36 questions
was developed and piloted among oncologists at Duke
University Medical Center, Durham, NC. The final survey was mailed to all NCCNOs identified through
search of the NCCN member Web sites (excluding
Duke) to identify all medical oncologists specializing in
breast cancer. The CBO sample was identified using the
ASCO 2008 Membership Directory. We randomly
selected potential subjects using the method of Helft et
al with selection of eligible US-based medical oncologists
identified as described in Peppercorn et al.11,12 Eligibility consisted of verification by survey that the participant
was a US-based practicing medical oncologist taking
care of at least one breast cancer patient per week. A second mailing was conducted 4 weeks after the initial
mailing to improve response rate. A $2 token incentive
was also included with the initial mailing.13 The study
was approved by the Duke University Institutional
Review Board.
Based on response rates in published surveys of US
oncologists, we estimated the response rate to be between
40% and 50%.12,14 To detect significant differences in
response of 20% with 80% power and 5% alpha, we
needed to survey 196 oncologists. We identified 173
NCCNOs through cancer center Web sites. Assuming a
response of approximately 50% among NCCNOs and
40% among CBOs, we would need to contact at least 275
physicians from the ASCO directory. Given potential for
wrong addresses and misclassification of invited participants, we contacted 300 CBO.
Analysis

The data were intended to be descriptive in nature, and
the results of this survey are designed to be hypothesisgenerating, rather than to definitively establish a link
between a set of oncologists’ responses and personal or
practice variables. The primary outcome of interest was
reported use of CYP2D6 testing as indicated by report of
percent of patients on tamoxifen, for whom CYP2D6
testing is currently being ordered. Our primary hypothesis
was that CBOs would be significantly more likely to offer
CYP2D6 testing compared with NCCNOs. Our study
was powered to detect a 20% difference in use of
CYP2D6 testing between these groups.

Secondary outcomes of interest included awareness
of CYP2D6 testing and currently published data in this
area, prevalence of patients or third parties requesting
CYP2D6 testing, willingness to order the test upon
patient request, response to genotype results in hypothetical clinical scenarios, and factors considered important
when considering ordering a genetic test. Descriptive statistics are reported. Fisher’s exact tests and independent
sample t tests were performed to test for significance. All
tests of hypotheses were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Of 300 surveys mailed to CBOs, 14 were returned due to
invalid addresses. Among 459 oncologists surveyed, 201
responded (44%), including 97 of 173 (56%) NCCNOs
and 104 of 286 (36%) CBOs. Respondent’s characteristics are reported in Table 1.
Awareness and Use of CYP2D6 Testing for
Patients on Tamoxifen

The vast majority of oncologists were aware of the
CYP2D6 test (90%); however, awareness of the test was
more frequent among NCCNOs versus CBOs (98% versus 83%, P < .001). Overall, 31% of oncologists reported
having ordered the test outside of a clinical trial, and 14%
reported routine use of the test in their clinical practice.
Use of the test in “routine” clinical practice, as opposed to
sporadic use, was defined as use in more than 10% of
patients on tamoxifen. By this definition, routine use
appeared more frequent among CBOs compared with
NCCNOs (22% versus 11%, P 5 .06). Only 6% of
oncologists reported use of the test in the majority of their
patients on tamoxifen, with 3% among CBOs and 9%

among NCCNOs, a difference that was not statistically
significant. Frequency of testing is reported in Figure 1.
In contrast, during this period, 82% of oncologists
reported ordering Oncotype or Mammaprint multigene
prognostic assays for at least 10% of patients with endocrine receptor-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer, and 38% reported using one of these tests for the
majority of such patients. There was no significant difference between CBOs and NCCNOs in use of multigene
prognostic assays.
Receipt and Response to Request for Testing
From Patients

Overall, 28% of oncologists reported that patients had
requested the CYP2D6 test. Requests for testing were
more frequently encountered by NCCNOs compared
with CBOs (33% versus 12%, P < .001). Even though
reported use of the test was rare, 56% reported that they
would order the test if requested by a patient (66% of
CBOs versus 44% of NCCNOs, P < .001). Although we
did not specifically ask oncologists to report changes in
patient management following request for testing, we
found that those reporting willingness to order the test on
request were also most likely to change management based
on test results. For example, when presented with a scenario of a premenopausal patient who is found to have a
poor metabolism genotype, 76% of those reporting willingness to order the test on request report that they would
change management (adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen, switching to ovarian suppression alone, or
switching to ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor), versus 36% of those who stated that they might
order the test, versus 14% of those who stated that they
would not order the test on request. Figure 2 displays

the patient. Twenty-two percent of oncologists also
reported receiving requests for CYP2D6 testing from
third-party insurers or pharmacies. We did not assess
response to such requests. Experience with ordering and
requests for testing is presented in Table 2.
Understanding of the Role of CYP2D6

We assessed beliefs regarding the importance of CYP2D6
for tamoxifen metabolism to determine whether there was
a correlation between the physicians’ understanding of
current evidence and their clinical practice. All questions
had been addressed in the scientific literature at the time
of the survey with ongoing research to determine conclusive results.
Among all respondents, 60% (57% CBOs, 62%
NCCNOs, P 5 .6) believed that recurrence risk was
higher for women with poor metabolism genotypes on tamoxifen. Although only 14% of physicians believed that
premenopausal women with poor metabolism were likely
to have better outcomes if treated with ovarian suppression and aromatase inhibitors instead of tamoxifen,
CBOs were significantly more likely to hold this belief
than NCCNOs (20% versus 7%, P 5 .008). Based on
emerging data,15 we also asked physicians whether some
antidepressant medications, such as serotonin-selective
reuptake inhibitors, could reduce tamoxifen metabolism
through CYP2D6. Overall, 76% believed that some
serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors could block
tamoxifen metabolism (91% NCCNOs versus 62%
3706

CBOs, P < .001). There was no significant correlation
between reported beliefs in the importance of CYP2D6mediated tamoxifen metabolism as expressed by response
to these questions and reported clinical practice when
comparing those reporting routine use of the test versus
rare/never use.
Willingness to Change Practice Based on
CYP2D6 Test Results

We presented 3 hypothetical scenarios regarding management of patients on tamoxifen who obtained commercially available CYP2D6 results from an external source.
For a premenopausal woman with a PM genotype, 33%
would make no change, whereas 56% would change therapy, including 38% who would switch to ovarian suppression (OS) plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI), 9% who
would switch to OS alone, and 8% who would add OS to
tamoxifen. CBOs were more likely to switch to OS plus
AI (47% versus 31%, P < .02), whereas NCCNOs were
more likely to recommend no change (50% versus 18%,
P < .001). For a premenopausal woman with IM genotype, 66% of respondents would make no change, 20%
would change therapy, with the remainder unsure (3%)
or writing in other responses (10%). CBOs were again
more likely to change therapy compared to NCCNOs
(34% versus 8%, P < .001), with addition of OS to tamoxifen being most frequently selected among both
groups. The third case involved a postmenopausal woman
with PM genotype. In this case, only 14% of respondents
would not change therapy, and the vast majority of both
CBOs and NCCNOs reported that they would switch to
AI (82% versus 71%, P 5 .08). The remainder reported
that they were unsure or commented they only use AI, not
tamoxifen, for postmenopausal patients. None would
stop therapy.

tively lower levels of importance were assigned to retrospective evidence of the tests utility for prognosis, toxicity,
or response. Overall, oncologists indicated that whether
their colleagues were using the test (practice among peers)
was considered relatively unimportant.

Factors Affecting Use of CYP2D6 Tests

We asked oncologists to rate the importance of factors
that might drive consideration of a ordering a genetic test
on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most important.
The list of factors and responses is reported in Figure 3.
The median importance was greater than 5 for all factors
listed, suggesting that the sensitivity of this nonvalidated
measure to determine which factors are most important
may be limited. Evidence of survival benefit from
randomized trials (mean 5 9.08) and professional guideline recommendations (mean 5 8.74) were rated the most
important factors among all oncologists. Professional
guidelines were rated more important among CBOs than
NCCNOs (mean of 9.01 versus 8.47, P 5 .02). FDA approval was rated 8 to 10 (highest importance) among
67% of CBOs versus 44% of NCCNOs (P 5 .002), with
means of 7.81 and 6.69, respectively (P 5 .002). RelaCancer

DISCUSSION
The CYP2D6 test is a prime example of the potential for
genetic technology to become commercially available
while scientific evidence to guide its use in clinical practice
is still evolving. At the time of our survey, the value of this
test to guide tamoxifen use was not established and clinical research was ongoing, but the test was both commercially available, advertised in the media, and requested by
patients and insurers and pharmacies. Today, even with
the most recent data suggesting no clear role for this test
in clinical practice, some mail-order pharmacies in the
United States continue to suggest that physicians consider
this test and request a rationale for not ordering the test
from the prescribing physician.16
The survey results presented above provides evidence of the potential for use of pharmacogenetic tests
3707

Original Article

outside of clinical trials, as this new era of pharmacogenomic testing presents an opportunity to consider how we
may better guide practice in this area in the future. Several
factors are notable. First, despite widespread awareness of
the test, just under one-third of oncologists reported ever
ordering it (31%), and use of the test in routine practice
was rare (14%). Only a small minority of oncologists
(6%) reported using this test in the majority of patients
during this period. This is in contrast to much more widespread (82%) reported routine use of multigene assays of
prognosis and response to tamoxifen among the same
clinicians. The basis for this difference is not known, but
cannot be attributable to commercial availability or duration of availability with both the Oncotype Dx test and
FDA-approved CYP2D6 test becoming available in 2004.
Factors that distinguish the 2 types of genetic tests include
strength of the evidence (strong data supporting Mammaprint and Oncotype testing was published in 2002 and
2004, respectively)17,18 and recommendations in national
guidelines (CYP2D6 testing was not covered in ASCO or
NCCN guidelines at the time of this survey). It is also possible that oncologists were more familiar with using tumor
genes and other biomarkers to guide therapy, and less
comfortable with the novel field of pharmacogenetics.
The hesitancy to use the CYP2D6 test, despite its
availability and some degree of patient demand, among
the vast majority of oncologists seems appropriate and
reassuring given the available evidence at the time of the
survey. However, use of the test was twice as common
among CBOs compared to breast cancer specialists at academic centers. This suggests that as novel tests become
commercially available, there is a need for education targeting community oncologists, who are expected to manage a highly diverse group of malignant diseases,
regarding current evidence and practice standards. Such
education could take the form of manuscripts, meeting
presentations, and/or provisional expert opinions such as
those produced by ASCO.19 As shown above, professional
guidelines were viewed as highly influential in guiding
practice, particularly among CBOs.
Although not using the test in routine practice, a
majority of oncologists (56%) reported willingness to
order the test if requested by a patient, and many suggested they would change treatment based on test results.
This may reflect the recent emphasis on shared decisionmaking, particularly in breast cancer management,20 and
could be deemed an appropriate response to clinical
uncertainty (ie, place a strong weight on patient preference when the harms and benefits of an intervention are
unclear). However, at minimum, this suggests a need to
3708

clearly inform patients of the clinical uncertainty surrounding the ordering of a test and to emphasize potential
harms from such practice. It also suggests a need to monitor the impact of direct-to-consumer advertising for
genetic testing on clinical care. For example, if premenopausal patients were taken off tamoxifen due to CYP2D6
tests suggesting poor metabolism and placed on OS and
an AI, it is possible, based on current evidence that they
received inferior therapy or equivalent therapy with
greater toxicity. The results of the TEXT and SOFT trials
should clarify the clinical significance of such changes in
therapy.21
Since this survey was conducted, 2 major trials investigating the importance of CYP2D6 genotype have suggested no role for CYP2D6 testing in routine practice. In
the ATAC trial, among 588 patients treated with adjuvant
tamoxifen with 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in breast cancer outcomes on the basis of
CYP2D6 genotype.6 Similarly, in the BIG 1-98 trial,
among 1243 women assigned to tamoxifen, there was no
difference in breast cancer outcomes on the basis of
CYP2D6 genotype.7 In fact, contrary to some earlier
reports, women with PM or IM genotypes appeared to
have higher rates of tamoxifen-associated side effects, suggesting that a strategy of testing for CYP2D6 or switching
therapy based on symptoms is inappropriate.7 However,
recent critique of these studies by genetics experts confirms that further investigation is still needed.8,9
In this context, these survey results provide a cautionary tale. We are reminded once again of the need for
adequate scientific evaluation of new medical technologies
and of the need for evidence-based practice. In a setting
where outcomes for too many women on tamoxifen
remain inadequate, there is an understandable desire to
adopt a test that promised to more rationally guide therapy.22 The tendency for some in clinical practice to be
early versus late adopters has long been documented, and
there are advantages and disadvantages to both
approaches.23 The question is where the threshold for
early adoption should be. Clearly, commercial availability
alone must not be a primary consideration, and promising
retrospective data must be followed by more rigorous prospective analysis. In fact, commercial availability while
evidence is in development might be a key criterion for
ASCO, NCCN, and others to plan educational outreach
to inform practice. CBOs cite guidance from professional
organizations, data from randomized controlled trials,
and insurance coverage as the 3 top factors they consider
when considering a genetic test. As we await definitive
trial data, and as cost promises to be less and less of a
Cancer

prohibitive factor in the future, guidelines and other
forms of educational initiatives may be the most effective
way to promoted evidence-based practice.24,25 Because
patient request appears to play a powerful role in shaping
practice in this area, there may also be a role for greater
efforts to provide patient-centered educational materials
on controversial clinical topics.
Limitations of this study include the potential for
response bias. Although more than 50% of breast cancer
specialists identified chose to participate, only 36% of
CBOs did so, leaving the possibility that those with
greater or less familiarity with the test opted to respond.
We did not adjust for multiple comparisons, and differences on the basis of practice setting should be interpreted
with caution. Similarly, suggestions that clinicians would
order the test if requested or change management based
on results were based on hypothetical scenarios and may
not correspond with actual clinical decisions.
This survey offers a rare window into the experiences
and views among academic and community-based oncologists regarding a then-novel pharmacogenetic test that
was commercially available and advertised in both the scientific and lay literature even as clinical evidence was in
development. Our results provide reassurance that despite
calls for increased CYP2D6 testing in routine practice in a
variety of forums, the use of CYPT was infrequent in oncology practice. Diversity in practice patterns and knowledge suggests a role for educational initiatives targeting
clinicians and patients when such tests become available,
and highlights the need for further research into how
novel technology is adopted in oncology and how educational interventions may improve evidence-based
practice.
