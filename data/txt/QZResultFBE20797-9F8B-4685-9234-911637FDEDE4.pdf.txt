ABSTRACT
Tumor- or cancer-associated fibroblasts (TAFs or CAFs) are active players
in tumorigenesis and exhibit distinct angiogenic and tumorigenic properties.
Adrenomedullin (AM), a multifunctional peptide plays an important role in
angiogenesis and tumor growth through its receptors calcitonin receptor-like
receptor/receptor activity modifying protein-2 and -3 (CLR/RAMP2 and CLR/RAMP3).
We show that AM and AM receptors mRNAs are highly expressed in CAFs prepared
from invasive breast carcinoma when compared to normal fibroblasts. Immunostaining
demonstrates the presence of immunoreactive AM and AM receptors in the CAFs (n
= 9). The proliferation of CAFs is decreased by anti-AM antibody (αAM) and antiAM receptors antibody (aAMR) treatment, suggesting that AM may function as a
potent autocrine/paracrine growth factor. Systemic administration of aAMR reduced
neovascularization of in vivo Matrigel plugs containing CAFs as demonstrated by
reduced numbers of the vessel structures, suggesting that AM is one of the CAFsderived factors responsible for endothelial cell-like and pericytes recruitment to built
a neovascularization. We show that MCF-7 admixed with CAFs generated tumors
of greater volume significantly different from the MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice
due in part to the induced angiogenesis. aAMR and AM22-52 therapies significantly
suppressed the growth of CAFs/MCF-7 tumors. Histological examination of tumors
treated with AM22-52 and aAMR showed evidence of disruption of tumor vasculature
with depletion of vascular endothelial cells, induced apoptosis and decrease of tumor
cell proliferation. Our findings highlight the importance of CAFs-derived AM pathway
in growth of breast carcinoma and in neovascularization by supplying and amplifying
signals that are essential for pathologic angiogenesis.

of tumors has been supported by the use of experimental
mouse models of cancer pathogenesis [3] and by clinical
evidence [4, 5]. The accumulated evidence indicates
that tumor cells actively recruit stromal cells, such as
inflammatory cells, vascular cells, and fibroblasts [6, 7],
into the tumor, and that this recruitment is essential for
the generation of a microenvironment that actively fosters
tumor growth.

INTRODUCTION
Although tumorigenesis has classically been viewed
as a largely cell-autonomous process involving genetically
transformed cancer cells, the importance of stromal cell
types populating the neoplastic microenvironment is
now well accepted [1, 2]. The contribution of the stromal
microenvironment to the development of a wide variety

The reactive tumor stroma is characterized by
expansion and activation of the fibroblast population,
excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM),
and persistant inflammation [7]. The cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) are phenotypically and functionally
distinguishable from their normal counterparts in their
increased rate of proliferation and differential expression
of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth
factors [7, 8]. Several studies have demonstrated that
normal fibroblasts have a role in maintaining epithelial
homeostasis by suppressing proliferation and oncogenic
potential of adjacent epithelia [3, 9]. However, following
neoplastic transformation of epithelia, CAFs have been
shown to promote tumor growth by inducing angiogenesis,
recruiting bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor
cells, and remodeling the ECM [6, 10, 11]. Interestingly,
CAFs can even mediate resistance to antiangiogenic
therapy [12]. Some CAFs are related to myofibroblasts,
an activated form of fibroblast that plays an important
role in wound healing and is characterized by expression
of α-SMA. Not all CAFs, however, express α-SMA.
Increasingly, fibroblasts in tumor tissues are being
recognized as a diverse population of myofibroblastic cells
intermixed with other fibroblastic cells that do not express
α-SMA but may nevertheless be tumor promoting [13, 14].
Characterization of the expression profiles of CAFs
has identified this cell type as an important producer of
chemokines and growth factors [10, 11]. Adrenomedullin
(AM), one such factor, belongs to a family of peptides
that includes calcitonin, α- and β-calcitonin gene related
peptide (CGRP) and amylin. It acts through the G proteincoupled receptor calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR),
with specificity for AM being conferred by the receptor
activity modifying protein 2 (RAMP2) and 3 (RAMP3)
[15]. The ability of CLR/RAMP2 and CLR/RAMP3 to
respond with high affinity to AM implies the existence
of two molecularly distinct AM receptors referred to
as AMR1 and AMR2 receptors [16]. Many functions
have been ascribed to AM. It has been shown to be a
multifunctional peptide with properties ranging from
inducing vasorelaxation to acting as a regulator of cellular
growth [17, 18]. AM is widely expressed in a variety
of tumor types [19] and was shown to be mitogenic for
many human cancer cell lines in vitro [20]. Several in
vivo studies have shown a regression of tumor growth
upon the treatment with neutralizing AM antibodies
[21–23], AM receptor antagonist [24, 25], or AM receptor
interference [26].
It is important to point out that AM from sources
other than the tumor cells themselves (i.e., paracrine
sources, such as fibroblasts, blood vessels, immune cells,
that surround the tumor bed) could influence the behavior
of tumor cells. We are gradually beginning to understand
the importance of non-tumor cells in the development of
cancer [2], but more attention is needed in understanding
how it relates to AM production. Accumulating studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest a new role for AM as a cross-talk molecule that
integrates tumor and tumor-infiltrating mast cells [27],
tumor-infiltrating macrophages [28], or endothelial cells
of the tumor [29] communication, underlying a promotion
mechanism to facilitate angiogenesis and tumor growth.
These results provide a new insight into the dynamic
nature of these tumor-infiltrating cells during the tumor
growth and support that AM can function as a key factor
in this process. Many reports suggest that fibroblasts in
tumor masses possess biological characteristics distinct
from those of normal fibroblasts [10, 11]. In this study,
characterization of human breast carcinomas CAFs led to
the identification of AM as a novel CAF-derived tumor
stimulatory factor that played a determinant role in human
breast cancer, especially with respect to growth, invasion
and angiogenesis.

RESULTS
Isolation of primary fibroblastic population from
invasive human breast cancers
We extracted fibroblasts from human invasive
mammary ductal carcinomas (n = 9) obtained from
mastectomies. The tumor masses were dissociated, and
various cell types were separated to obtain populations
of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We then
verified the purity of the fibroblasts populations by
immunostaining. These fibroblast populations strongly
expressed fibroblastic markers such as vimentin (Figure
1A, a), PDGFRα (Figure 1A, b), and fibroblast surface
protein-1 (FSP-1) (Figure 1A, c), whereas these cells
were negative for cytokeratin (Figure 1A, e). Fibroblasts
can be misidentified as macrophages because both cell
types share antigens that are associated with antibodies
targeting the monocyte/macrophage lineage. To determine
whether macrophages cells do not contaminate the
isolated cells prepared from breast cancer tissues, we
used immunofluorescence to investigate the expression
of various macrophage surface markers including
F4/80, CD68 and CD163 [30]. Co-expression of CD68
and CD163, is a marker for the M2 anti-inflammatory
macrophage phenotype [30]. As illustrated in Figure
1B, immunofluorescence revealed a barely detectable
immunostaining of CD68 in CAFs (Figure 1B, d) and
NHDFs (Figure 1B, g) meanwhile no expression can be
detected for CD163 and F4/80 markers in CAFs (Figures
1B, e and f) and in NHDFs (Figures 1B, h and i), ruling
out that the cells prepared from breast cancer tissue
are not macrophages. The RAW264.7 cells, a partially
differentiated macrophage-like monocytic cell line [31],
was used as positive control, which expresses strongly
CD68 (Figure 1B, a) and F4/80 (Figure 1B, c) markers
with a moderate expression of CD163 marker (Figure 1B,
b). In agreement with the present data, previous studies
reported that fibroblasts isolated from normal skin, normal

breast, and breast tumor tissue clearly expressed CD68
protein at levels comparable to macrophages [32, 33].
We also found that no more than 0.1% of the cells in
each fibroblast population were positive for CD31, CD45,
CD11b and CD268 (data not shown). Taken together, these
observations indicate that these fibroblast populations
were prepared with minimal contamination by epithelial,
endothelial, or hematopoietic cells, such as leukocytes and
erythrocytes.

hepatocyte growth factor, EGF, TGF-β, and chemokines,
such as CCL5 and CCL12, which are known to exert
protumorigenic and prometastatic actions [35, 36]. We
hypothesized that AM is one of the CAF-derived factors that
might be involved in the CAFs-induced tumor formation
and angiogenesis. We therefore quantified expression levels
of AM mRNA in the various stromal fibroblast populations.
Total RNA from NHDFs (n = 3) and CAFs (n = 9) was
prepared to assess the steady-state levels of AM, CLR,
RAMP2, and RAMP3 mRNA transcripts. The individual
patterns of expression of AM mRNA are presented in
Figure 3A. Quantification of the AM mRNA transcripts
revealed 4- to 24- fold higher levels of AM mRNA in CAFs
when compared to NHDFs. Among the CAFs populations,
the individual pattern of expression for AM, CLR, RAMP2,
and RAMP3 mRNAs was highly variable (Figure 3A).
Interestingly, SDF1 mRNA demonstrated higher expression
in CAFs when compared to NHDFs (Supplementary
Figure 1). The increase of SDF1 expression in CAFs is in
agreement with the previously reported study [11]. A clear
variability of expression of AM and SDF1 mRNAs can
be observed in individual CAF (Supplementary Figure 1).
Omission of reverse transcriptase eliminated all signals,
thus suggesting that our results were not attributable to
contaminating genomic DNA.
The presence and cellular localization of AM,
CLR, RAMP2, and RAMP3 in CAFs was analyzed using
immunofluorescence. Representative images are shown in
Figure 3B; in the images CAFs have been immunostained
for AM, CLR, RAMP2 and RAMP3. Positive staining was
completely abolished by pre-absorption of the antibody
with 50μM synthetic peptide (not shown).

Characterization of CAFs as activated
fibroblasts (myofibroblasts)
Expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
is a defining characteristic of myofibroblasts [34]. An
increased proportion of α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts
was seen in three isolated CAF populations when
compared to normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs)
(Figures 2A, 2B). The increased α-SMA expression was
largely maintained in the initially characterized CAF cells
for up to nine population doublings in vitro (Figure 2B),
indicating that isolated CAFs contain a high proportion
of myofibroblasts. These results confirmed that the CAFs
possessed the properties of myofibroblasts and maintained
these traits without the continued presence of carcinoma
cells.

Expression of AM, CLR, RAMP2, and RAMP3
in CAFs
CAFs promote tumor formation in human breast
cancers [11]. CAFs are a source of growth factors, like

of total cell numbers (> 100 counted cells) were evaluated in ten independent fields from four different wells of each fibroblast type under

(349 ± 15 pg/mg protein), and NHDFs (47 ± 5 pg/mg

that ir-AM is synthesized and actively secreted by CAFs

were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) anterior to the
abdominal rectus sheath with Matrigel alone or with
Matrigel admixed to CAF3, or admixed to NHDFs. In
vivo Matrigel plug bioassays for angiogenesis revealed
that plugs injected with CAF3 (Figure 5A, e, f) were
significantly more vascularized than did plugs injected
with NHDFs (Figure 5A, b, c) or without fibroblasts
(not shown). Similar results were obtained with CAF1,
CAF2, CAF6 and CAF8 (not shown). Importantly, these
results demonstrate that CAFs are not only critical for
the recruitment of vascular cells such as vascular and
lymphatic endothelial cells and pericytes to enhance
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, but also that they
can directly mediate these effects in the absence of tumor
cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that AM secreted
by CAF3 might be involved in the vascularization that
occured in the in vivo Matrigel plug bioassays injected
with CAF3.
To demonstrate that AM secreted by CAF3 is
involved in the promotion of the vascular and lymphatic
channels, we used treatment with αAMRs to inhibit
recruitment of circulating AMR-positive cells as reported
previously [25]. Matrigel plugs supplemented with CAF3
were injected s.c. into C57BL/6 mice forming semisolid
plugs. Twenty-four hours later, mice were treated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with αAMRs or control IgG at
350 μg every three days for a total of 15 days. Treatment
of the animals with αAMRs induced a clear decrease of
the angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the plugs
injected with CAF3 (Figure 5A, h, i). No effect on the
vascular and lymphatic channels can be observed in the
plugs of group animals treated with control IgG (Figure
5A, k, l). Quantification of CD31-positive endothelial cells
(Figure 5B) and LYVE-1 positive lymphatic endothelial
cells (Figure 5C) demonstrated a marked decrease in the
number of both cell types in plugs admixed with CAF3
from animals treated with αAMR compared to animals
that received control IgG (p < 0.001; Figures 5A, 5B, and
5C). In second series of experiments, in vivo Matrigel plug
bioassays for angiogenesis was quantitated by measuring
the uptake of FITC-dextran (~150,000) into plugs before
their removal from mice. The data demonstrate that the
vascularization induced by the CAF3 injected into the
plugs was stable and functional (Figure 5D). αAMRs
treatment significantly inhibited by 60% to 75% the
uptake of FITC-dextran in plugs compared to the plugs
from animal treated with rabbit control IgG (Figure
5D). These data suggest that a part of angiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis revealed in plugs is due to AM
secreted by CAF3.
To strengthen our findings, we therefore tested the
possibility that AM secreted by CAFs might be involved
into the recruitment of endothelial cells and pericytes to
foster a functional and stabilized angiogenesis. We had
shown that AM induces recruitment of different cell types
such as endothelial-like cells, pericytes, and macrophages/

AM mediate the phosphorylation of MAPK and
AM blockade inhibits CAFs proliferation
ERK and serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt)
regulate cell proliferation, and both of these signaling
pathways function downstream of the AM/cAMP pathway
[23, 37]. Therefore, we examined the kinetics through
which AM enhanced MAPK signaling. Treatment of CAFs
with AM led to prolonged phosphorylation of ERK1/2
that was initially observed after 5 min of treatment
and continued to increase through 20 min of treatment
(Figure 4A). This increase in signaling correlated with
sustained phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK in CAFs
(Figure 4A). Inhibition of MEK, an immediate upstream
activator of ERK1/2, with U0126 (10 μM for 30 min)
prevented AM-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (Figure
4A). Pre-incubation of CAFs with αAMRs prevented the
stimulatory effect of AM on pERK1/2 and also decreased
strongly the pERK1/2 levels observed in control cells
suggesting that the endogenous AM secreted by CAFs
might be involved by autocrine/paracrine loop to activate
the MAPK pathway (Figure 4A). These data suggest that
AM is involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway
through AMR.
The activation of the MAPK pathway by AM
in CAFs suggests that AM may be involved in CAFs
growth through an autocrine/paracrine loop. All the CAFs
showed no increase in proliferation in the presence of the
maximum AM concentrations (10−7 M) when compared
with untreated cells after 6 days treatment (Figure 4B).
Consistent with an autocrine function for AM in these
cells, αAM- or αAMRs-added to CAFs culture medium
significantly reduced cell proliferation by as much as
40% (p < 0.01) when compared with cells treated with a
nonspecific isotype control antibody (Figure 4B). Taken
together, these observations indicate that AM is involved
in the CAFs growth through AMR.

might be involved in the angiogenic activities of growing
tumors. To this end, we used the in vivo Matrigel plug

receptors are expressed in cultured primary HUVECs
[38] and HUVSMCs [23], suggesting that these cells
could be recruited by AM secreted by CAFs to assist neovessels formation during tumor growth. The migration
and invasion assays demonstrate that CAF3-conditioned
medium (CAF3-CM) promoted invasion of bone marrowderived cells (BMDCs), migration and invasion of
HUVECs and HUVSMCs in Transwell assay (Figures 6A,
6B, and 6C). Neutralization of CAF3-CM with a functionblocking antibody to AM (αAM) or pre-incubation of

cells with αAMRs significantly inhibited the stimulating
effects of CAF3-CM on migration and invasion (Figures
6A, 6B, and 6C). These data strongly suggest that AM
must be one of the CAF-derived factors responsible for
endothelial cells, pericytes/smooth-muscle cells and
BMDCs recruitment to promote a stabilized and functional
angiogenesis. Importantly, in vivo Matrigel plug bioassays
for angiogenesis revealed that plugs injected with CAF3
were significantly vascularized than did plugs injected
with a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 which express
low basal levels of AM mRNA (Figures 7A, 7B, and 7C).

assay. Each bar represents the mean ± standard error of the mean of three independent experiments. Significant differences between the

To evaluate the functional role of AM in MCF-7/
CAF3 xenografts growth, we investigated the effects
of inhibition of AM signaling on tumor xenografts. To
assess the potential therapeutic value of αAMRs and
AM antagonist (AM22-52), athymic nude mice bearing
established MCF-7/CAF3 xenografts (~200 mm3) were
treated with αAMRs, AM22-52, or control IgG. Treatment
was administered by i.p daily injection for AM22-52 (50
μg/mouse), and every 3 days for αAMRs (12 mg/kg) and

support tumor growth in part through the stimulation of
angiogenesis, via the secretion of AM. Interestingly, the
tumors in mice co-injected with NHDFs had a phenotype
not different from the one obtained with the MCF-7 alone
(Figure 9A).
Remarkably, the co-inoculated CAF3 survived in
large numbers in tumors together with carcinoma cells for
periods of up to 29 weeks after injection, as determined
by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific
for human vimentin (Figure 9B) and α-SMA (Figure
9B), which MCF-7 cells fail to express. It is of interest
to observe that CAF3 demonstrates expression of AM in

control IgG (12 mg/kg) as reported previously [23, 24].
To monitor tumor growth, tumor volume was measured
throughout the treatment period. The growth of the MCF7/CAF3 xenografts was significantly reduced by αAMRs
and AM22-52 treatments compared with that in the control
group (Figure 9D). After 12 weeks treatment period,
animals were sacrificed, and tumor size was assessed. The
mean tumor weights in the animals treated with control
IgG, αAMRs, and AM22-52 were 2.5 ± 0.4 g, 0.4 ± 0.10 g,
and 0.5 ± 0.15 g, respectively (Figure 9E).

with αAMRs, AM22-52, and control IgG (Figures 10A and
10B). Significantly higher numbers of cleaved caspase-3positive cells were observed in tumors from the animals
treated with αAMRs and AM22-52 (Figures 10A and 10C).
MCF-7/CAF3 xenografts from IgG-control-treated
animals were significantly more vascularized, as assessed
by immunostaining for the endothelial cell marker
CD31 (Figure 10A). Consistent with our hypothesis
that AM signaling inhibition would result in a decrease
in angiogenesis, immunohistochemical staining for
CD31 demonstrated that tumor vascularization is deeply
disrupted in tumors from animals treated with αAMRs
and AM22-52 (Figure 10A). Quantification of CD31positive endothelial cells demonstrated a clear decrease
in tumors from animals treated with αAMRs and AM22-52

DISCUSSION
CAFs, myofibroblast-rich cell populations
extracted from human carcinomas maintain an ability
to promote tumorigenesis. These cells, passaged for 10
passages doubling in vitro without ongoing interaction
with carcinoma cells, retained their ability to promote
tumor growth when co-injected with carcinoma cells
into immunodeficient mice [39, 40]. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying their tumor-promoting
ability are poorly understood. Some have reported the

well as ir-AM when compared to normal fibroblasts. (iv)
αAM and αAMR could inhibit the basal levels of CAFs
proliferation in vitro, which is consistent with the fact that
AM can act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to induce
CAFs proliferation and increases activation of the MAPK
pathway. The presence of an autocrine loop suggests
that the foci of AM-producing cells in tumor tissue
could stimulate cells expressing AM receptors through
autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. (v) Myofibroblasts
extracted from within invasive human breast cancer
masses are more competent than normal fibroblasts in
enhancing a stable vascularization in in vivo Matrigel
plug bioassay for angiogenesis. (vi) ir-AM secreted by the
myofibroblasts is responsible of induction of migration
and invasion of endothelial cells, pericytes, and BMDCs
in vitro and in vivo, thereby boosting tumor angiogenesis.
(vii) We demonstrated that some CAFs cultures expressed
both AM and SDF-1 mRNAs. It will be of interest to
understand whether AM and SDF-1 peptides act in concert
or separately to promote tumor growth when both are
relatively well expressed in CAFs.
We demonstrated that CAFs admixed with breast
cancer cells, enhanced angiogenesis both in heterotopic
MCF-7 tumors and in an in vivo Matrigel plug bioassay
lacking cancer cells. The ability of CAFs to influence
tumor growth was partly dependent on their ability to
induce angiogenesis by CAF-derived AM and recruitment
of BMDCs. On the basis of results from our study as well
as those from previous report [44], we conclude that AM is
an angiogenic and tumor promoting factor that is secreted
by tumor cells and stromal cells such as myofibroblasts in
breast cancer tumors.
The blockade of the AM receptors by systemic
administration of αAMRs or AM22-52, inhibits angiogenesis
in an in vivo model and the growth of admixed MCF-7
cells/CAF3 xenografts. We demonstrated that addition
of CAF3 to Matrigel plug bioassay in vivo significantly
enhanced plug neovascularization, which was effectively
inhibited by systemic injection of αAMRs. This blocking
effect was confirmed on tumor xenografts growth in
vivo. In fact, the treatment of admixed MCF-7 cells/
CAF3 xenograft-bearing mice with αAMRs or AM22consistently resulted in tumor regression, suggesting
52
that the tumor is most susceptible to αAMRs and AM22therapies. CAF3-treated with αAM or αAMRs showed
52
a growth inhibition in vitro suggesting that the growth
inhibition in vivo might be due to the effect of αAMRs and
AM22-52 on tumor vasculature and CAFs growth in vivo.
The immunohistochemical analysis of admixed tumors
xenografts derived from animals treated with αAMRs or
AM22-52 showed a clear decrease in microvessel density,
with a 65% to 80% reduction in endothelial cells and
pericytes within the tumor, which is consistent with the
role of AM in endothelial cell and pericyte survival and
recruitment. Interestingly, the density of vessels with
lumen decreased dramatically. The loss of microvessels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

within αAMRs or AM22-52-treated tumors suggests that
AM stimulation of CLR/RAMP2/RAMP3-expressing
tumor vasculature acts as a survival mechanism for
proliferating tumor endothelium. In agreement with
previous studies, these data demonstrate that AM secreted
by CAFs could play a role to foster a stabilized and
functional neovascularization in growing tumors [25,
38, 45]. Recently, we showed that the blockade of AM
signaling selectively targets unstable tumor neovessels
through rapid disengagement of the VE-cadherin/β-catenin
complex, destabilization of the cytoskeleton organization
of endothelial cells, and subsequent apoptosis-mediated
cell death [46].
The data reported in the present study echo findings
of others demonstrating that stromal fibroblasts isolated
from human prostate carcinomas have an increased ability
to foster tumor formation when compared to normal
prostatic fibroblasts [6]. In 1999, the groups of Tlsty and
Cunha demonstrated a striking tumor-promoting property
of stromal fibroblasts extracted from human prostate
carcinomas when these were compared with control
normal fibroblasts isolated from the noncancerous prostate
gland [6]. Such fibroblasts have been shown to regulate
carcinoma cell growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis,
either in a positive or negative fashion [47–49].
CAFs exhibit increased levels of secretory
molecules that include growth factors and chemokines
such as VEGFA, HGF, PDGF, TNF, IL-6, IL-8 and SDF1 [for review see ref 50]. CAFs have been shown to
promote tumor growth by directly stimulating tumor cell
proliferation and by enhancing angiogenesis [3, 10, 11].
Fibroblasts are also key players in wound healing [51, 52],
mediating extracellular matrix remodeling and generation
of contractile forces. It has also been suggested that
fibroblasts mediate the transition from acute to chronic
inflammation by inappropriately providing recruitment,
survival, and retention signals to infiltrating leucocytes,
thus inhibiting the normal resolution of inflammation [53–
55]. Previous studies have reported that fibroblasts are a
source of cytokines or chemokines or both in tumors [56–
58]. Moreover, a study-using laser capture microdissection
revealed CXCL12 and CXCL14 to be upregulated in
stroma of prostate and basal cell carcinomas [59, 60].
The ability of CAFs to influence tumor growth was partly
dependent on their ability to induce angiogenesis by CAFderived SDF-1 (also known as CXCL12) and recruitment
of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells [11] or by CAFderived PDGF-C, a member of the PDGF family [12] or
secreting proangiogenic factors [61].
The notion of targeting CAFs to inhibit tumor
growth and progression is attractive due to the increasing
identification of stimulatory factors derived from the
tumor stroma. Targeting of stromal fibroblast effector
functions by drugs inhibiting the action of osteopontin,
CXCL12, CXCL14, FGF-2, PDGF-C, AM, and many
more, singularly or in combination, holds promise of

producing therapeutic efficacy. In addition, approaches
to prevent the recruitment and phenotypic conversion of
CAFs are highly warranted.

CLR, anti-RAMP2, and anti-RAMP3 were developed and
characterized in the laboratory.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CAFs (1.5 × 106) and NHDFs (1.5 × 106) were
cultured in DMEM/F12 medium for 48 hours. The
immunoreactive AM in cell extracts as well as in medium
was measured using a commercially available AM ELISA
kit (Euromedex, Strasbourg, France).

Immunoassay for human AM

Cell culture
The human breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the
partially differentiated monocyte-macrophage cell line
RAW 264.7 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). The
cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C
and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Lonza BioWhitaker, France)
supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM) and 5% heatinactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Lonza) and in absence
of antibiotics. HUVECs and HUVSMCs (Lonza) were
cultured in EGM-2 medium (Lonza) containing 2%
FBS and M199 medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies
Inc.) containing 20% FBS, respectively, in humidified
atmosphere at 37°C with air/5% CO2. HUVECs and
HUVSMCs monolayers from passages 2–4 were used in
these studies.

RNA preparation and real-time quantitative RTPCR
Total RNA was prepared from CAFs, NHDFs,
and MCF-7 cells and reverse transcribed to cDNA as
described [63]. Human AM, CLR, RAMP2, RAMP3
and GAPDH mRNAs [58] and human stromalderived factor (SDF1) mRNA (forward primer
5’-CGATTCTTCGAAAGCCATGT-3’ and reverse
primer 5’-CTTGCTTGTTGTTGTTCTTCAGC-3’) were
amplified, detected and quantitated in real-time using
LC480 PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France)
as described [63, 64].

Isolation and culture of cancer–associated
fibroblasts

Western blot analysis
Cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted for
phospho-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 using the MAPK-phosphoERK1/2 pathway sampler kit (Cell signaling Technology,
Inc.) as previously described [23]. Antibody signals were
revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL
kit, Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc.).

Cancer–associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated
from human breast tumor biopsies as previously described
[62]. Tissues were digested with F15 medium with
0.037% hyaluronidase (sigma), 1 mg/ml collagenase/
dispase (Roche), 1% FBS, and antibiotics for 1-2 hr at
37°C. Dissociated cells were filtered through both 100
μm and 40 μm filters. Washed filtrates were plated onto
1% gelatin-coated plates and cultured in 10% FBScontaining DMEM/F12 medium maintained at 37°C in a
humid atmosphere of 95% air/ 5% CO2. After 48 hours
incubation, suspension tumor cells were removed after
vigorous washing. After 2-3 passages, an apparently pure
fibroblast population was obtained. All CAFs used in this
study had undergone fewer than ten population doublings
in culture. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs)
(Promocell) were cultured in promocell growth medium
(Promocell).

Cell proliferation assay
AM (10−7 M), rabbit anti-human AM (αAM; 70
μg/ml), and anti-human AM receptor (αCLR, αRAMP2
and αRAMP3) (70 μg/ml) neutralizing antibodies
(purified IgG) previously developed in house [21, 38]
were added daily to the culture to evaluate their effects
on cell proliferation. After six days treatment, the
effects were examined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay (Promega,
Lyon, France).

Immunostaining of the human fibroblasts

Transwell migration and invasion assays

Primary cultured fibroblasts were examined by
immunofluorescence using anti-cytokeratin-18 (Sigma),
human specific anti-vimentin (V9; Novocastra laboratories,
Ltd., UK), anti-fibroblast surface protein (1B10; Sigma),
anti-human CD31 (Santa Cruz, California), anti-α–SMA
(1A4; Dako, Denmark), anti-PDGFRα (Dako), antihuman CD68 (1/100, BD Pharmingen™), anti-human
CD163 (1/100, Bio-Rad), and anti-human F4/80 (1/50,
Invitrogen) antibodies. The antibodies anti-AM, anti-

A modified Boyden chamber assay was used to
analyze migration and chemoinvasion of murine bone
marrow derived cells (BMDCs), HUVECs, or HUVSMCs
as described previously [38, 64].

Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France), admixed to NHDFs
(1.5 × 106) or CAFs (1.5 × 106) in 50 μl of PBS or alone as
a negative control. Twenty-four hours later, mice injected
with Matrigel combined with CAFs were randomized
into two groups and treated i.p. with αAMRs (330 μg) or
preimmune serum (purified IgG, 330 μg) every three days.
Two weeks later, animals were sacrificed, and the Matrigel
plugs were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for histological analysis. Immunohistochemical
analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded sections
using the Vectastain Elite ABC Universal kit (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with antibodies from Dako
Inc. (Glostrup, Denmark) for CD31 (1:20) and LYVE-1
(1:100).
The second group of animals was injected
systemically into the lateral tail vein with 100 mg/kg
FITC-dextran solution (molecular weight ~ 150,000;
Sigma Chemical Co., Lyon, France) and allowed to
circulate for 25-30 min. Before mice sacrifice, blood
samples were collected by cardiac puncture and plasma
was separated. The Matrigel plugs were resected, placed
into tubes containing Dispase reagent (Thermo-Fisher,
Cergy-Pontoise, France), and homogenized. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was saved for analysis of
fluorescence. Fluorescence readings were obtained on an
FL600 fluorescence plate reader (BioTek). Angiogenic
response was expressed as a ratio of Matrigel plug
fluorescence/plasma fluorescence.

Sections (6 μm) were cut from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded xenografts. Immunohistochemistry
was performed using the Vectastain Elite ABC Universal
kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described
previously [23, 64]. Antibodies against CD31 (1:20,
Dianova), Ki-67 nuclear antigen (1:100; Dako), and
cleaved caspase-3 (1:100; BD Pharmingen™) were used
for the analysis. For each marker, whole-surface staining
was quantified using Image J Software (NIH, Bethesda,
USA).

Tumor vascular density
Quantitation of vessel count was performed as
previously described [65]. The blood vessels were counted
randomly from non-necrotic areas in each tumor section in
an x200 microscope field, on CD31-stained tissue sections.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ±SEM from at least
three independent experiments. One-way analysisof
variance (ANOVA) or Fisher’s PLSD test (Statview 512;
Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA, USA) was used for
statistical analysis. Differences were considered significant
at values of p < 0.05.

MCF-7 cells (1 × 106) alone (n = 10) or
admixed with CAFs (3 × 106) (n = 30) were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank of female nude
mice. Tumors sizes were determined with a dial-caliper
measurements, and the tumor volume was calculated as
width × length × height × 0.5236 (for ellipsoid form).
Mice with tumor volume greater than 2,000 mm3 were
sacrificed in accordance with Aix-Marseille University
Animal Rights Committee guidelines. When the
tumors were ~200 mm3 in size, animals were randomly
divided into three groups. One group (n = 10) received
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of αAMRs (12 mg/kg
purified IgG in 200 μl PBS) every 3 days; the second
group (n = 10) received 50 μg of AM antagonist AM22daily as described previously [24]; and the third
52
group (n = 10) received an irrelevant antibody (IgG of
the same isotype). The αAMRs were characterized as
described [25] and all IgG preparations were tested for
endotoxin using the Pyrogent plus Limilus ameboycote
lysate kit (Lonza). All antibody preparations used
in animal studies contained < 1.25 U/ml endotoxin.
Tumors sizes were measured every 3 days, and mice
were sacrificed at 29 weeks after injection. Tumors
were embedded in Paraffin for pathologic studies and
immunohistochemistry.
