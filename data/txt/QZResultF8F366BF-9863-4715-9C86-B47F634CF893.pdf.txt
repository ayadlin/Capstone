ABSTRACT
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression resulting from the uncontrolled migration
and enhanced angiogenesis is an obstacle to effective therapeutic intervention. Tumor
metabolism has distinctive feature called Warburg effect, which enhances the aerobic
glycolysis rapidly supplying the energy for migration of tumor. To manipulate this
metabolic change characteristic of aggressive tumors, we utilized the citrus extract,
auraptene, known as a mitochondrial inhibitor, testing its anticancer effects against
the RCC4 cell line. We found that auraptene impaired RCC4 cell motility through
reduction of mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic pathway-related genes. It also
strongly disrupted VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia-inducible
factor 1a (HIF-1a), a key regulator of cancer metabolism, migration and angiogenesis
that is stably expressed in RCCs by virtue of a genetic mutation in the von Hippel–
Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein, was impeded by auraptene, which blocked
HIF-1a translation initiation without causing cytotoxicity. We suggest that blockade
HIF-1a and reforming energy metabolism with auraptene is an effective approach for
suspension RCC progression.

ATP [4–6]. As such, this switch is considered indispensable
for the migration of RCC cells. Some types of solid cancer
with a highly metastatic phenotype, such as RCC and breast
cancer, require a high intracellular antioxidant capacity and
enhanced ATP generation to support tumor cell migration
[7]. Although, it has been reported that mitochondrial
complex I inhibitors such as rollinistatin and bullatacin,
decrease mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation,
thereby inhibiting metastasis of lung and breast cancer cells
[8], their effect on RCC has not been studied. Accordingly,
suppression of ATP generation by targeting both glycolysis

INTRODUCTION
Nephrectomy is the first-line strategy for curative
treatment in the early stage of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Yet despite this surgery, 30% of RCC patients face the risk
of metastasis to distant sites, including liver, lymph node,
brain, bone and pancreas, resulting in a 5-year decrease
in survival [1–3]. The aggressiveness of these cancers
is accompanied by a metabolic switch toward aerobic
glycolysis, called the Warburg effect, which reduces reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels and increases the supply of

and mitochondrial respiration is seen as essential for
blocking cancer progression [9]. However, efforts to reverse
glycolytic changes in cancers and inhibit mitochondrial
respiration are known to produce cytotoxic effects [9, 10].
Moreover, no modulators with dual mitochondria- and
glycolysis-targeting activity that are effective against RCC
have been reported.
Auraptene, a natural compound initially isolated
and purified from citrus fruit, is known as a mitochondrial
complex I inhibitor [11]. In rodent models, auraptene
has shown inhibitory effects on mammary and oral
carcinogenesis and metastasis of melanoma through
modulation of metabolism-related processes, such as
hypoxic signaling [12–14]. Auraptene has also been
reported to possess apoptogenic activity toward human
acute leukemia cells [15]. Although auraptene is among
the most useful drugs for regulating tumor progression
through modulation of energy metabolism, its efficacy
against RCC has not been tested.
Hereditary forms of RCC, including von Hippel–
Lindau (VHL) syndrome, account for 2–4% of total
RCC occurrence [16]. The tumor suppressor VHL is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for regulating the
degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α).
In patients with congenital VHL, a mutation in the VHL
gene that inactivates VHL leads to dysregulation of
HIF-1α, setting the stage for the development of RCC
[17, 18]. Loss or mutation of the remaining wild-type
allele results in constitutive expression of HIF-1α, which
is a key modulator of tumor metabolism. Induction of
HIF-1α by hypoxia—a characteristic feature of the tumor
environment—promotes the transcription of target genes
that lead to invasiveness, metabolic shift, angiogenesis,
and metastatic potential [19–21]. Overexpression of
HIF-1α is correlated with metastasis of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells [22]. In the current study, we selected
auraptene as a candidate modulator of energy metabolism
in RCC4 cells through direct targeting of HIF-1α and
mitochondrial respiration, examining its suppressive
effects on cancer progression.

in DMSO-treated RCC4 cells (Fig. 1B) but did not change
in basal ECAR level (Fig. S1). Despite strongly inhibiting
mitochondrial complex I, auraptene had no effect on cell
viability, as determined by MTT assay (Fig. 1C). Similarly,
auraptene treatment did not affect cell growth in the
sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Fig. 1D).
As auraptene inhibits mitochondrial respiration,
cells would require a supply of glycolytic ATP to
maintain growth. We found that the mRNAs encoding
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2),
phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase
A (LDHA), all key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway,
were expressed in RCC4 cells, but quantitative RT-PCR
(qPCR) showed that their expression was reduced 30–
60% in the presence of auraptene (p < 0.05; Fig. 1E–1H).
Nevertheless, intracellular ATP content and ADP/ATP
ratio were unchanged by auraptene treatment (Fig. S2).
Collectively, these results indicate that auraptene
significantly reduces mitochondrial respiration in RCC
cells and slightly suppresses the transcription of glycolytic
pathway-related genes without affecting cell growth.

Auraptene decreases RCC4 cell motility and
inhibits tube formation by HUVECs
A reduction in energy metabolism can affect cell
motility and angiogenesis as well as cell proliferation
[23]. To test whether auraptene has an inhibitory effect
on RCC4 cell motility, we performed wound-healing
assays. RCC4 cells were cultured in the presence of
different concentrations of auraptene or DMSO; then, cell
monolayers were wounded by scoring with a pipet tip and
the gap width was measured after 24 h of treatment. Gap
closure was decreased by about 20% in auraptene treated
cells compared with DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 2A, 2B),
suggesting that auraptene effectively disrupted tumor cell
migration. Tube formation by HUVECs is an indicator
of tumor angiogenesis [20, 24]. We assessed the effect
of different concentrations of auraptene (0, 50, 75 and
100  μM) on tube formation by HUVECs. HUVECs
cultured on Matrigel under hypoxic conditions formed a
capillary tube network. Auraptene inhibited tube formation
by Matrigel-cultured HUVECs compared with DMSOtreated cells, decreasing the number of branch points
at the lowest concentration tested (50 μM) and further
decreasing the number of branch points at 75 μM (by ~7)
and 100 μM (by ~10) (Fig. 2C, 2D). These results indicate
that auraptene significantly reduces motility of RCC4 cells
and effectively inhibits tube formation by HUVECs.

RESULTS
Auraptene inhibits glycolytic and mitochondrial
metabolism, but does not affect cell growth
Because auraptene is an inhibitor of mitochondrial
complex I [11], it may be a candidate for the regulation
of energy metabolism in RCC. To assess whether
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in
RCC is affected by auraptene, RCC4 cells were incubated
with 100 μM auraptene or DMSO (vehicle control) for
24 h and the effects on basal OCR were determined using
an XF-24 analyzer. Auraptene significantly inhibited
mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 1A), decreasing the basal
OCR area under the curve by about 67% compared to that

either DMSO or 100 μM auraptene was subcutaneously
injected to the flanks of nude mice. Seven days later, the
plugs was detached from the skin and visualized. In the
absence of auraptene, the plugs had a red color due to
the infiltration of vessels (Fig. 3A). Neovascularization
was quantified by measuring the hemoglobin content
of the plugs, with the hemoglobin content of each plug
represented as a percentage of control. Plugs in the
auraptene treated group had a 5-fold lower hemoglobin
content than control plugs (Fig. 3B), and a lower density
of infiltrated blood vessels. VEGF-induced angiogenesis is
crucial for tumor progression [24, 25] and antiangiogenic
agents have been used to inhibit aggressive tumor spread.
We verified whether auraptene affects the transcription of
Vegf-a, finding that auraptene reduced Vegf-a mRNA level
by ~70%, as shown by qPCR analysis (Fig. 3C). These
results indicate that auraptene effectively inhibited VEGFinduced angiogenesis in vivo.
To determine whether auraptene inhibited
angiogenesis in vivo, 1x107 RCC4 cells were
subcutaneously injected into 5 week old nude mice,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

followed nine days later by the intratumoral injection
of auraptene every other day (Fig. 3D). We found that
auraptene treated mice had reduced tumor growth,
whereas tumors injected with DMSO showed a gradual
increase in size (Fig. 3E). After 25 days, the mice were
sacrificed and tumor weight and vascularization status
were analyzed. As expected, tumor weight (Fig. 3F)
and the number of well-vascularized vessels (Fig. 3G,
3H) were each about one-third lower in auraptene- than
in DMSO-treated mice. Immature vessels with reduced
diameter, blood leakage represented by red blood cells
and stained with brown colored hemosiderin were
observed in auraptene injected group compared to
the well-formed vessels of DMSO-treated mice with
basement membrane and pericytes surrounding vessel
wall. (Fig. 3G). Consistent with H&E staining results,
immunofluorescence showed that auraptene reduced
the number of CD31 positive cells but increased
heterogeneity (Fig. 3I, 3J). Taken together, these findings
indicate that auraptene can inhibit vessel formation,
suppressing tumor cell growth.

Auraptene induces HIF-1α degradation in
a VHL-independent manner, and HIF-1α
knockdown delays RCC4 cell migration

[17, 28]. Unlike the case for murine embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs), HepG2 human hepatic carcinoma cells and
MCF-7 human breast cancer, HIF-1α was notably elevated
in RCC4 cells, even under normoxic conditions, and was
prominently localized in the nucleus (Fig. S4A, S4B).
In RCC4 cells treated for 24 h, auraptene decreased
HIF-1α protein levels in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 4A). Over this same time frame, treatment
with 100  μM auraptene resulted in the time-dependent
degradation of HIF-1α (Fig. 4B). To test whether auraptene
affected HIF-1α induction in the context of hypoxic
conditions representative of the tumor environment, we
reconstituted VHL in RCC4 cells, which lack endogenous
VHL, and assessed the effects of auraptene (100 μM)

HIF-1α is involved in promoting vessel formation
through induction of VEGF expression and enhancing
tumor growth through upregulation of glycolytic pathwayrelated genes [20, 26, 27]. To test the role of HIF-1α in
mediating the effects of aurapene, we first assessed HIF-1α
transcription levels by qPCR, but found no significant
change in HIF-1α mRNA level with auraptene treatment
(Fig. S3). Next, we assessed whether auraptene affected
HIF-1α protein levels in RCC4 cells, which constitutively
express HIF-1α protein owing to a deficiency of VHL

on these RCC4/VHL cells under normoxic (20% O2)
and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. As shown in Fig. 4C,
auraptene strongly decreased HIF-1α protein levels in
RCC4/VHL cells under hypoxic conditions, and also
inhibited mitochondrial respiration (Fig. S5). These
results suggest that auraptene induces HIF-1α downregulation regardless of the presence or absence of VHL.
To determine whether the inhibitory effect of auraptene
on cell migration is a consequence of HIF-1α inhibition,
we transfected RCC4 cells with a siRNA targeting a
Hif-1α consensus RNA and performed wound-healing
assays. Knockdown of HIF-1α was confirmed by Western
blotting (Fig. S6). Following wounding and treatment with
auraptene, gap distance was increased more than 2-folds in
siHif-1α–transfected cells compared with cells transfected
with a scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 4D, 4E).

evaluated proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1α.
In RCC4 cells treated with DMSO (vehicle control),
co-treatment the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted
in the accumulation of HIF-1α. Notably, however, even
with the proteasome inhibited with MG132, co-treatment
with auraptene still significantly decreased HIF-1α
levels compared with DMSO co-treatment (Fig. 5A).
Interactions with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) are
important for HIF-1α protein stability, with dissociation
from HSP90 leading to proteasome-mediated degradation
of HIF-1α [29, 30]. To determine whether auraptene
acted by interfering with the association of HIF-1α
with HSP90, we overexpressed HSP90 in RCC4 cells
by transfecting cells with a FLAG-HSP90 expression
construct and tested the interaction of HIF-1α with
HSP90 in the presence and absence of auraptene. We
found that auraptene had no effect on the association of
HIF-1α with HSP90 (Fig. S7). Taken together, these data
suggest that auraptene-induced HIF-1α down-regulation
is not dependent on proteasome-mediated degradation.
We did find, however, that auraptene decreased the halflife of HIF-1α protein in RCC cells, showing that, in the
presence of cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein

DISCUSSION

synthesis, HIF-1α protein levels decreased more rapidly
in the presence of auraptene (Fig. 5B, 5C). Finally, we
examined whether the effects of auraptene on HIF-1α
levels involved eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α
(eIF2α), a component of the eIF2 ternary complex that is
known to initiate HIF-1α gene translation [31]. In RCC4
cells and HeLa cells grown under hypoxic conditions,
treatment with auraptene significantly increased the levels
of phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) (Fig. 5D and Fig. S8).
These results suggest that auraptene down-regulates
HIF-1α protein by inhibiting its translation initiation
rather than by promoting its degradation (Fig.  5E).
Notably, auraptene did not affect cleavage of poly-(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), an apoptosis marker protein,
in HeLa cells (Fig. S8), further supporting the conclusion
that auraptene is not cytotoxic.

About 30% of patients with RCC, a potentially
fatal type of solid tumor, suffer from uncontrolled
metastasis and chemoresistance [1–3]. RCC metastasis is
starting from enhanced migration and it is not restricted
to lymph nodes around the kidney, but can spread to
distant organs, such as the pancreas, bone, and brain.
To date, interferon  (IFN), sunitinib and bevacizumab,
and interleukin (IL)-2 have been the main options for
treating RCC and preventing recurrence. Unfortunately,
response rates for these drugs in preventing metastasis
and recurrence are only ~15% [32]. Given this limited
efficacy, clinicians have turned to other therapeutics,
including sorafenib and pazopanib—inhibitors of vascular
endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) that target tumor

angiogenesis—and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors that
target platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR)-α or
VEGFR-1. However, these drugs are unable to overcome
chemoresistance and leukopenia owing to their cytotoxic
effects [33–35]. In the present study, we investigated the
anticancer properties of auraptene, isolated from citrus
fruit, against RCC. We found that auraptene significantly
suppressed tumor energy metabolism, leading to
inhibition of motility and it did so without causing
cytotoxicity.
Cancer cells favor anaerobic glycolysis as
the metabolic pathway for obtaining ATP, although
mitochondrial OXPHOS still provides low amounts of
ATP [9]. This preference has motivated trials to reverse
the aberrant metabolism in cancer cells using drugs
such as the α-tocopherol derivative, ESeroS-GS [9,
36]. However, it has been reported that α-tocopherol
derivatives and combined administration of glycolysis
and mitochondrial inhibitors are associated with
cytotoxicity [8, 37]. In contrast, one previous study
reported that administration of auraptene was cytotoxic
toward breast cancer cells only under serum-starved
conditions. Furthermore, against the Jurkat T cell
line, auraptene showed cytotoxic effects only at high
concentrations (>150 μM) [15]. According to the previous

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

report, auraptene content of dried peel powder of Citrus
Kawachiensis was defined to 4.07 ± 0.033  mg/g [38].
They daily administered 32 and 64 mg/kg of auraptene to
mouse orally and it showed beneficial effect for defending
inflammation. We have mostly used 100 μM auraptene in
current study, which is obtainable using the concentrated
powder and it did not show toxicity at this concentration.
Notably, although auraptene treatment suppressed
mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic pathway-related
genes in RCC cells, it did not affect cell viability at
concentrations less than 100 μM. In line with the cell
viability result, ATP content and ADP/ATP ratio did not
changed and we can predict the alternative pathway of
glycolysis compensate energy depletion such as TCA
cycle and beta oxidation (Fig. S9). Moreover we cannot
find any Tunnel positive cells by treatment of auraptene
in vivo (Fig. S10A, S10B). Accordingly, auraptene could
be a candidate for inhibiting cancer progression with no
associated cytotoxicity.
The enhancement of VEGF-induced angiogenesis is
observed in stages of tumor progression and therapeutic
strategies targeting neovascularization of tumor has
been tried [25]. So, we assessed whether auraptene
had an antiangiogenic effect. We found that auraptene
directly decrease VEGF mRNA expression. Importantly,

38133

auraptene effectively inhibited tube formation by HUVEC
cells under hypoxic condition. Also, auraptene inhibited
VEGF-induced neovascularization by 10-fold in vivo.
Tumor cell motility and neovascularization are necessary
for RCC progression, a process that requires rapid
availability of an abundant energy supply. According to
the Warburg effect, most of the energy used is supplied
by glycolysis. Consistent with this hypothesis, HK2
and GLUT1 are also highly expressed in many tumors,
including RCCs, and mediate enzymatic and transport
processes involved in glycolysis [39]. Furthermore,
LDHA contributes to aerobic glycolysis in tumors. The
abovementioned glycolysis-related genes are targeted
by the transcription factor, HIF-1α. Unlike other tumors,
which express HIF-1α only under hypoxic conditions,
RCCs express high levels of HIF-1α under normoxic
conditions. We found that auraptene abolished HIF-1α
protein translation and reduced transcription of HIF-1α
target genes, including GLUT2, HK2 and LDHA, which
are involved in regulating tumor metabolism [5, 19,
21]. This ablation of HIF-1α by auraptene was further
associated with inhibition of angiogenesis, as reflected
in reduced endothelial tube formation and decreased
expression of VEGF, as well as suppression of RCC
cell migration. As expected, siRNA-mediated HIF-1α
knockdown resulted in inhibition of RCC cell motility.
Consistent with these findings, small molecule inhibitors
of HIF-1α such as PX-478 and geldanamycin have been
shown to reduce tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis
[29, 40, 41]. However, unlike auraptene, these compounds
also induce apoptosis.
EIF2α is known to regulate HIF-1α gene
translation [31]. Phosphorylation on Ser51 of the eIF2α
subunit blocks formation of the eIF2 ternary complex,
resulting in inhibition of HIF-1α translation [40].
Aminoflavone, a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor,
is known to repress HIF-1α translation in human breast
cancer cells by inducing eIF2α phosphorylation [42].
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is also reported to regulate HIF1α through eIF2α phosphorylation. This study showed that
auraptene significantly induced phosphorylation of eIF2α
beginning at 6 h, and that acute treatment with auraptene
rapidly (within 7 min) inhibited mitochondrial respiration
(Fig. S11A, S11B) and simultaneously increased ECAR
(Fig. S11C, S11D). Although we did not specifically
address the temporal relationship between mitochondrial
inhibitory function and eIF2α phosphorylation, we expect
that suppression of mitochondrial energy metabolism
proceeds to HIF-1α degradation within 6 h. Inhibitors of
HIF-1α transactivation carry a risk of causing coagulative
necrosis and cytotoxicity [43]. However, because HIF-1α
is not the initial target, auraptene can more effectively
inhibit cellular motility and tube formation without
causing cytotoxicity. Auraptene effect on HIF-1α downregulation was also verified using HeLa cells grown under
hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. Additionally, auraptene
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significantly induce phosphorylation of eIF2α in a dose
dependent manner (Fig. S8). These finding suggests that
anticancer property of auraptene through inhibition of
HIF-1α is not restricted to renal cell carcinoma. Taken
together, our results demonstrate that auraptene exerts a
suppressive effect on the progression of RCC4 cells by
strongly inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and directly
targeting HIF-1α signaling, without producing cytotoxic
effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
RCC4 and RCC4/VHL human RCC cells were
purchased from ECACC (Salisbury, UK). As instructors
indicated, RCC4 cells were stably transfected with
pcDNA3 vector and RCC4/VHL cells were transfected
with pcDNA3-VHL, conferring neomycin resistance.
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml G418
at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2/21% O2 environment.
Low-oxygen conditions were created by adjusting the
environment to 1% oxygen, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 using
a hypoxia chamber (New Brunswick Scientific, CT,
USA). Auraptene was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Cycloheximide was purchased from SigmaAldrich, and MG132 was from Calbiochem. Knockdown
of HIF-1α in RCC4 was achieved by transfecting cells for
24 h with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using G-fectin
(Genolution Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Republic of Korea),
as described by the manufacturer.

Determination of oxygen consumption rate
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was analyzed
using an XF24 analyzer (Seahorse, MA, USA). RCC4
or RCC4/VHL cells were plated at 5 x 103 cells/well and
incubated with DMSO or 100 μM auraptene for 24  h.
After measuring basal OCR, the mitochondrial ATP
synthase inhibitor, oligomycin (2 μg/ml), was added,
followed sequentially by addition of the mitochondrial
uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCCP; 5 μM), and the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor,
rotenone (2 μM). OCR was measured after addition of
each agent.

Measurement of cell viability
RCC4 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and
incubated in media containing different concentrations of

5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added.
After  1  h, the MTT-containing media were removed
and DMSO was added to dissolve formazan crystals.
Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan
Ascent plate reader (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). In
the sulforhodamine B assay, RCC4 cells (4x103 cells
per well) were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates and
incubated overnight. To each well as added medium
containing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μM auraptene, followed
by incubation for 12 or 24 h. The media were discarded
and cells were fixed with 10% TSA at 4°C for 1 h. After
washing with distilled water, the cells were incubated
with 0.4% SRB (Sigma-Aldrich, SG, Switzerland)
solution at room temperature for 20 min. The plates were
washed with 1% acetic acid five times and dried in air.
Proteins were resolved with 10 mM unbuffered Tris and
absorbance was read at 490 nm using a Multiskan Ascent
plate reader.

were plated on Matrigel basement membranes (BD
Biosciences, NJ, USA) and incubated for 8 h under
hypoxic conditions. Auraptene was added to media,
after which cells were stained with calcein-AM (SigmaAldrich, SG, Switzerland). Intracellular calcein-AM
fluorescence (n = 10 slides/condition) was imaged using
an IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

Matrigel plug assay
Matrigel (BD Bioscience, MA, USA) was thawed
on 4°C, then, 400 μl of Matrigel was mixed with 200 μl
serum-free DMEM media, 50 ng VEGF (R&D Systems,
MN, USA) and 40 u heparin (Huons, Seongnam, Republic
of Korea). DMSO or 100 uM auraptene was added to the
mixture. Then, Matrigel mixture was subcutaneously
injected to the flank of 6 weeks old male immunedeficient mice (n = 5, each group). Mouse were purchased
from Japan SLC (SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) and kept in
pathogen free facility. Animal experiment was approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Chungnam National University. The ethical approval
number is CNU-00356. Neovascularization was quantified
by measuring hemoglobin content using Drabkin’s
reagents (Sigma-Aldrich, SG, Switzerland) after 7 days
of injection. After removing plug from skin, plug was
homogenized at 4°C for 18 hours and centrifuged at
10,000 rpm at 4°C. 5 ml of Drabkin’s solution was added
to the supernatant and incubated at RT for 15 minutes. The
absorbance at 540 nm was measured in ELISA plate reader
(Molecular Devices, CA, USA).

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using isolRNA lysis reagent (5 PRIME, CA, USA). cDNA way
synthesized from total RNA by reverse transcription using
an M-MLV reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen, CA,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
using a SYBR mix and a Rotor-Gene 6000 RealTime Rotary Analyzer system (Corbett Life Science,
Venlo,  Netherlands). The following primer pairs were
used: HIF-1α, 5′-CCA CCT ATG ACC TGC TTG GT-3′

Xenograft model
To generate RCC4 xenografts, 1x107 cells in 100 μM
serum free DMEM were mixed with an equal volume of
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA), and the mixture
was injected subcutaneously into 5 week old male nude
mice (n = 10 per group). Beginning 9 days later, auraptene
or DMSO diluted in 50 μl saline was intratumorally
injected every other day. Tumor size was measured with
calipers and tumor volume was calculated using the
formula: width2x length/2. The mice were sacrificed and
the tumor tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
immunohistochemistry.

Wound-healing assay

Immunohistochemistry

RCC4 cells were cultured in the presence or absence
of auraptene, then, monolayers were scratched with a pipet
tip. Gap width was measured after 24 h using ImageJ
program.

Tumors of DMSO- or auraptene- treated mice was
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded.
Sections were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining. After deparaffinization, sections were stained
with Harris hematoxylin for 4 minutes. Then, sections
were washed with running water 4 min, stained with eosin
for 2 min and serial washing with ethanol and xylene
was proceeded. For CD31 immunofluorescence staining,
