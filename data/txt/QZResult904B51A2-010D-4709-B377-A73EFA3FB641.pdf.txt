Abstract
We have previously shown that butyrate, a short-chain fatty
acid fiber fermentation product, induces colonocyte apoptosis
via a nonmitochondrial, Fas-mediated, extrinsic pathway.
Interestingly, fermentable fiber when combined with fish oil
containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) exhibits an
enhanced ability to induce apoptosis and protect against
colon tumorigenesis. To determine the molecular mechanism
of action, the effect of DHA and butyrate cotreatment on
intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis was examined. Mouse colonocytes were treated with 50 Mmol/L DHA or linoleic acid (LA)
for 72 h F butyrate (0–10 mmol/L) for the final 24 h. Cytosolic
and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels were measured using Fluo-4
and Rhod-2. DHA did not alter basal Ca2+ or the intracellular
inositol trisphosphate (IP3) pool after 6 h butyrate cotreatment. In contrast, at 12 and 24 h, DHA- and butyrate-treated
cultures exhibited a 25% and 38% decrease in cytosolic Ca2+
compared with LA and butyrate. Chelation of extracellular
Ca2+ abolished the effect of thapsigargin on the IP3-releasable
Ca2+ pool. DHA and butyrate cotreatment compared with
untreated cells increased the mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2+
ratio at 6, 12, and 24 h by 73%, 18%, and 37%, respectively.
The accumulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ preceded the onset of
apoptosis. RU-360, a mitochondrial-uniporter inhibitor, abrogated mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and also partially
blocked apoptosis in DHA and butyrate cotreated cells.
Collectively, these data show that the combination of DHA
and butyrate, compared with butyrate alone, further enhances
apoptosis by additionally recruiting a Ca2+-mediated intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5561–8]

Introduction
There is substantial experimental, epidemiologic, and clinical
evidence indicating that fish oil–containing diets rich in n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), for example, docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA, 22:6D4,7,10,13,16,19) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,
20:5D5,8,11,14,17), are protective against colon tumorigenesis (1–3).
In addition, there is evidence from epidemiologic and observational studies indicating that the consumption of fiber, which
increases butyrate levels in the lumen of the colon, is chemo-

protective against colorectal cancers (4, 5). In contrast, several
systematic reviews have challenged the premise that dietary fiber
and fish oil reduce colon cancer risk, fueling a debate regarding
the role of dietary fat and fermentable fiber as chemoprotective
nutrients (6–9). To address this apparent conundrum, our
laboratory has focused on the question as to why a diet
containing highly fermentable fiber is only protective when fish
oil is the lipid source. We have shown that the bioactive
components generated by fermentable fiber (butyrate) and fish oil
(DHA) work coordinately to protect against colon tumorigenesis,
primarily by increasing apoptosis rather than decreasing cell
proliferation (3, 10, 11). With regard to a molecular mechanism of
action, we have shown that DHA alters colonocyte mitochondrial
membrane composition and function, thereby creating a permissive environment for apoptosis induced by luminal metabolites,
such as butyrate (12, 13). More recently, we have shown that
mitochondrial lipid oxidation products, membrane phospholipidderived hydroperoxides (LOOH), play an important role in DHA
and butyrate-induced apoptosis (14). Despite the evidence
indicating that the combination of dietary fish oil and
fermentable fiber enhance apoptosis and suppress colon cancer,
we still lack information regarding the precise molecular
mechanisms by which the DHA and butyrate combination protect
against colon tumorigenesis.
With respect to molecular triggers for apoptosis, Ca2+ is one of
the most versatile and universal signaling mediators in cells and is
required for the activation of many cellular processes. Increasing
evidence indicates that alterations in the finely tuned intracellular
homeostasis and compartmentalization of Ca2+ can lead to cell
death either through apoptosis or necrosis. The Ca2+ concentration
inside the cell is regulated by the simultaneous interplay of various
counteracting mechanisms, which can turn cellular signals ‘‘on’’
and/or ‘‘off ’’ (15). Eukaryotic cells can increase their cytosolic Ca2+
levels via two mechanisms: release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores
or influx via plasma membrane channels. Channels located in the
plasma membrane, for example, store-operated Ca2+ channels
(SOC), receptor-operated channels, and voltage-operated channels,
regulate the influx of Ca2+ into the cell. Currently, there is a good
understanding of the organelles that function as Ca2+ stores and
how Ca2+ can be released from stores into the cytosol. Although the
importance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the major storage
organelle is indisputable, growing evidence indicates that functional compartmentalization of Ca2+ exists within the various
cellular organelles. More recent studies have identified the
contributions of the nuclear envelope, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes,
and mitochondria in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis
and cellular physiologic function (16, 17). In fact, it is now
recognized that mitochondria play a key role in both apoptosis and
necrosis by regulating energy metabolism, intracellular Ca2+

homeostasis, activation of caspases, and the release of reactive
oxygen species (18, 19).
Mitochondria are localized in close proximity to inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (IP3)–gated channels situated on the ER. Ca2+
uniporters, which are low-affinity and high-capacity active pumps
located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, rapidly take up Ca2+
that is released from the ER stores and recirculate it back into the
cytosol via exchangers such as the Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger (20, 21).
Therefore, mitochondria can be regarded as critical checkpoints in
Ca2+ signaling, acting as membrane-bound Ca2+ buffers. Under
normal conditions, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake serves as a signal to
increase cellular metabolism (20). However, in certain situations,
mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is a trigger for cytochrome c
release and the induction of apoptosis (22).
Given the central role of mitochondria in the commitment to
apoptosis, we hypothesized that n-3 PUFA and butyrate can
promote apoptosis by triggering changes in mitochondrial Ca2+
levels that contribute to caspase activation and colonocyte cell
death. We used an immortalized mouse colonocyte (YAMC) cell
line to determine whether chemoprotective nutrients modulate
intracellular calcium compartmentalization and SOC entry to
induce colonocyte apoptosis. The results confirm and extend our
previous observations and show that DHA and butyrate combination synergistically alter intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization
by enhancing mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation through an SOCmediated mechanism. These outcomes provide clear evidence that
an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ stores contributes to the
induction of apoptosis by DHA and butyrate cotreatment.

Materials and Methods
Materials. RPMI 1640 and HBSS were purchased from Mediatech. Fetal
bovine serum was from Hyclone. Insulin, transferrin, and selenium without
linoleic acid (LA), were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products.
Glutamax, recombinant mouse IFN-g, and Leibovitz medium were from Life
Technologies. Fatty acids were obtained from NuChek. Fluo-4 AM, Rhod-2
AM, and Calcium Calibration buffer kit 2 were purchased from Molecular
Probes. RU-360 and SKF-96365 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell death
detection ELISA kit was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Two-well
Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass slides were purchased from Nunc, Inc.
Thapsigargin, staurosporine, EGTA, sodium butyrate, and all other reagents
were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of 1.0 mmol/L Fluo-4, AM, and
4.0 mmol/L Rhod-2 were prepared in DMSO and diluted with medium to 3.0
and 2.0 Amol/L, respectively ( final concentration of the vehicle DMSO was
maintained at 0.1–0.3% in culture). Thapsigargin stock (5.0 mmol/L) was
prepared in DMSO and used at a concentration of 5.0 Amol/L (0.1% DMSO).
RU-360 (1 mmol/L) stock was prepared in degassed water and diluted to a
final concentration of 10 Amol/L for cell treatment. A (1 mmol/L) stock
solution of staurosporine was prepared in DMSO and diluted to a final
concentration of 1 Amol/L for cell treatment.
Cell culture. Conditionally immortalized YAMC cells were originally
obtained from R.H. Whitehead (Ludwig Cancer Institute, Melbourne,
Australia). Cells were cultured under permissive (33jC with IFN-g) or
nonpermissive conditions (39jC) as previously described (14, 23). For all
fluorescence measurements, cells (passages 12–18) were seeded onto
borosilicate two-chambered cover glass slides at a density of 5  103 to
7  103 to achieve a 50% to 70% confluence. For apoptosis assays, cells
were seeded onto 35-mm cell culture dishes or six-well plates at a density
of 35  103. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)–complexed fatty acids were
added to cultures 24 h after cell plating as previously described (23).
Select cultures were treated with BSA-complexed DHA (22:6, n-3) or LA
(18:2, n-6; 0–200 Amol/L) for 72 h. Cells were coincubated with sodium
butyrate (0–10 mmol/L) in RPMI 1640 for the final 6, 12, 24, or 48 h of
fatty acid pretreatment.

Quantification of cytosolic Ca2+ in mouse colonocytes. Following
fatty acid and butyrate treatment, cells were washed with Leibovitz
medium, free of serum and phenol red. Cells were loaded with 3 Amol/L
Fluo-4, AM, at 33jC to determine the levels of cytosolic Ca2+. Fluo-4 is a
visible wavelength nonratiometric cytosolic Ca2+ indicator that exhibits a
40-fold increase in fluorescence intensity with Ca2+ binding (24, 25).
Following a 1-h incubation with the probe, cells were washed with Leibovitz
medium and imaged. Images were acquired from groups of 10 to 20 cells,
10 to 12 areas per well, and 4 to 8 wells per treatment using a Stallion
Digital Imaging workstation equipped with 300 W xenon fluorescent light
source. Fluorescent light was rapidly (<2 ms) switched between excitation
wavelengths. Images were captured using a 20 objective 0.75 numerical
aperture and a ROPER CoolSnap HQ camera. For image acquisition,
imaging variables were adjusted for maximum detection of fluorescence
with minimal cellular photobleaching. Cells were excited at 488 nm, and
fluorescence emission from individual cells was collected at 530 nm. Image
acquisition frequency was set to one image every 10 s. Fluorescence
intensities were recorded for 300 s. A minimum of two experiments done on
different days were analyzed. Basal intracellular Ca2+ was measured before
the addition of thapsigargin. Thapsigargin is an irreversible sarcoplasmic/
ER Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor that was used to empty the
intracellular Ca2+ store from the ER (25). Fluorescence intensities after
thapsigargin stimulation were normalized to basal Ca2+ levels.
To determine the contribution of IP3 Ca2+ pools, extracellular Ca2+ was
chelated using 2 mmol/L EGTA followed by cell stimulation with
thapsigargin. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ facilitates quantification of
IP3 Ca2+ released from the ER after thapsigargin addition (26, 27). Ca2+ was
then added back into the medium and the contribution of the SOC pool was
evaluated (25). To further evaluate the association between PUFA and
butyrate cotreatment and SOC, cultures were preincubated with 10 Amol/L
SKF-96365, a pharmacologic inhibitor of SOC, for 5 min before image
acquisition. Calibration of intracellular Ca2+ was done using the Calcium
Calibration Buffer kit 2 from Molecular Probes as previously described (28).
Analysis of mitochondrial Ca2+. Cells treated with fatty acid and
butyrate were washed with Leibovitz medium and coloaded with 3 Amol/L
Fluo-4 and 2 Amol/L Rhod-2 for 1 h at 33jC. Cells were then washed twice
with Leibovitz medium, and the mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2+ ratio was
measured. For quantification of Fluo-4 and Rhod-2 fluorescence, excitation
light was provided at 488 and 550 nm and fluorescence emissions were
collected at 530 and 580 nm, respectively. The ratio of the cytosolic-tomitochondrial Ca2+ level was subsequently calculated. Although accumulation of Rhod-2 dye in the nucleoli was noticed, MitoTracker was used to
confirm that dye loading was predominantly localized within the
mitochondria as previously described (29). In other experiments, cells were
incubated with RU-360 (10 Amol/L), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial
uniporter, for 30 min before butyrate cotreatment (30). Cells were then
washed and coloaded with fatty acid and butyrate for the final 6, 12, or
24 h after which the mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2+ ratio was determined.
Nucleoli were not included in the analysis of mitochondrial Ca2+.
Apoptosis assays. Apoptosis was measured using cellular fragmentation
ELISA (Roche) and caspase-3 activity assay (Molecular Probes) as previously
described (23). To determine the association between mitochondrial Ca2+
and apoptosis, select cultures were preincubated with RU-360 (10 Amol/L)
for 30 min before butyrate exposure. Cells were washed and treated with
5 mmol/L butyrate and apoptosis was measured after a 6-, 12-, or
24-h incubation period.
Statistical analysis. The effect of independent variables (treatment
effects) was assessed using SuperANOVA. Differences among means were
determined using t/F–type tests of contrast. P values <0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.

Results
DHA and butyrate combination decreases cytosolic Ca2+.
Cytosolic Ca2+ levels were initially examined after stimulation with
thapsigargin, an irreversible SERCA pump inhibitor used to empty
ER Ca2+ stores. Figure 1A shows representative traces of

thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response measured over 300 s. The
arrow indicates the time point of thapsigargin addition. Butyrate
treatment (5 mmol/L) over a period of 6 to 24 h increased (P < 0.05)
cytosolic Ca2+ in cells preincubated with LA (50 Amol/L, a control
n-6 fatty acid) by up to 45% compared with untreated control
(Fig. 1B–D). In contrast, cells preincubated with DHA consistently
exhibited a lower cytosolic Ca2+ level compared with LA and
butyrate cotreatment. Control cultures containing either DHA or
LA alone, in the absence of butyrate, exhibited a modest increase in
cytosolic Ca2+ levels, 8% to 12%, compared with untreated control
(Fig. 1C and D, inset). In comparison, cultures treated with LA and
butyrate exhibited a 45% increase compared with untreated control
at both time points. Changes in Ca2+ levels were detected as early
as 6 h after butyrate and fatty acid cotreatment.
SOC involvement in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. To examine the role of SOC entry, the increase in plasma
membrane influx associated with ER Ca2+ emptying was characterized using a Ca2+ add-back protocol. This standard procedure
uses extracellular Ca2+ chelation with EGTA followed by utilization
of thapsigargin to induce an initial emptying of the ER Ca2+ pool,
followed by repletion of the bathing solution with Ca2+ (26, 27).
Consistent with previous experiments (Fig. 1) after incubation with
5 Amol/L thapsigargin, butyrate (24 h)–treated cells preincubated
with DHA in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ exhibited a 40%
decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ compared with LA-primed cells (P < 0.05;

Fig. 2). Subsequently, extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by addition of
2 mmol/L EGTA, which allows for indirect quantification of the ER
Ca2+ pool. In these experiments, butyrate-treated cells primed with
DHA or LA showed no difference in cytosolic Ca2+ levels (P > 0.05;
Fig. 2). Following replacement of the medium with CaCl2
(10 mmol/L), the phenotype was reestablished, implicating the
involvement of plasma membrane channels in the propagation of
fatty acid–induced Ca2+ signaling.
To identify the plasma membrane channels involved in eliciting
a rise in calcium influx after ER Ca2+ depletion in colonocytes,
cultures were incubated with SKF-96365, an inhibitor of nonvoltage-gated, SOC channels (31, 32). Typically, butyrate-treated
cells primed with DHA or LA were preincubated with 10 Amol/L
SKF for 5 min before basal recording. SKF abrogated the fatty acid–
induced effect on cytosolic Ca2+ levels after 12 h butyrate cotreatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar effects were observed after
prolonged butyrate treatment (24 h; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Thus, the activation of SOCs, leading to rapid entry of Ca2+ through
the plasma membrane, is likely to contribute to the observed fatty
acid and butyrate-induced perturbation in colonocyte Ca2+ homeostasis.
Effect of DHA and butyrate cotreatment on mitochondrial
Ca2+ levels. Because the efflux of Ca2+ from the ER can lead to
coupled increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, we assessed the
effects of fatty acid and butyrate cotreatment on mitochondrial

Figure 1. Effects of fatty acid and butyrate on thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response. YAMC cells were treated with fatty acid alone (50 Amol/L) for 72 h with butyrate
(5 mmol/L) for the final 6 h (B), 12 h (C ), or 24 h (D ). Cells were subsequently incubated with Fluo-4 (3 Amol/L), a fluorescent cytosolic Ca2+ indicator for 1 h at
33jC, and basal Ca2+ was measured. Representative traces (15–20 cells/trace) are shown in (A ). Arrow, point of thapsigargin (5 Amol/L) addition. Normalized intensity

Figure 2. Effect of fatty acid on thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response in the

cells were stimulated with thapsigargin (5 Amol/L). C, CaCl2 (10 mmol/L) was
added back to the extracellular medium and cytosolic Ca2+ was quantified.
Columns, mean; bars, SE. Data not sharing common letters are significantly
different, P < 0.05. Representative data are from a single experiment, n = 2
independent experiments. Refer to Fig. 1 for legend details. In colonocytes
with the combination of DHA and butyrate, chelation of extracellular Ca2+
abolished the difference in cytosolic Ca2+ levels and replenishing extracellular
medium with Ca2+ reestablished the difference. Taken together, these data
show that plasma membrane channel entry contributed to the difference seen
in cytosolic Ca2+ level.

Ca2+ uptake. Butyrate cotreatment for 6 h increased (P < 0.0001)
the mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2+ ratio in cells treated with DHA
by 73% in comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, at
12 and 24 h, DHA and butyrate selectively increased (P < 0.0001)

mitochondrial Ca2+ by 18% and 37%, respectively (Fig. 3B and C). In
contrast to DHA-treated cultures, cells incubated in the presence of
LA showed a small response or no change in the mitochondrial-tocytosolic Ca2+ ratio compared with untreated cells. With respect to
the fatty acid–only controls, LA treatment had no effect on the
mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2+ ratio. DHA treatment tended to
increase the mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2+ ratio at all time points
(Fig. 3B and C, inset). However, in all cases, cultures pretreated
with DHA and coincubated with butyrate showed the largest
increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3). Representative
photomicrographs of untreated cells and cultures coincubated with
butyrate (5 mmol/L for 24 h) and DHA or LA (50 Amol/L) are
shown in Fig. 3 (D–F).
Effects of a mitochondrial uniporter inhibitor on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake after DHA and butyrate cotreatment. To
investigate the role of the mitochondrial uniporter in Ca2+ uptake,
cells were treated with RU-360, a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
inhibitor (33). RU-360 (10 Amol/L) partially inhibited (P < 0.001) the
butyrate-induced increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ in DHA-primed
cells upon addition 30 min before butyrate cotreatment at 6 or
12 h (Fig. 4). In comparison, RU-360 had no effect on mitochondrial
Ca2+ levels in LA-treated cells.
Induction of colonocyte apoptosis by fatty acid and butyrate
combination. Using the nucleosomal fragmentation assay, DHA
significantly (P < 0.0001) enhanced butyrate-induced apoptosis
compared with cells treated with LA plus butyrate or butyrate
alone (control) at 12 and 24 h (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast,
fatty acid treatment alone had no effect on apoptosis (Supplementary Figs. S2C, inset, S3A and B). To further corroborate these
observations, complimentary methodology (caspase-3 activity) was
also used. Similar results were obtained (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
For comparative purposes, staurosporine, a broad-spectrum
protein kinase inhibitor, which induces apoptosis in normal and
malignant cells, was used as a positive control (34). As expected,

cultures preincubated with 1 Amol/L staurosporine for 4 h exhibited
an 8-fold increase in apoptotic cells compared with untreated or
fatty acid–treated cells (P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. S2C, inset).
The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor, RU-360, suppresses induction of apoptosis after DHA and butyrate
cotreatment. To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and cellular apoptosis, we compared the levels of
apoptosis observed in DHA plus butyrate–treated cells in the
absence or presence of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor
RU-360. Results obtained in experiments with butyrate at 12 and
24 h after DHA or LA cotreatment are shown in Fig. 5. RU-360
significantly (P < 0.05) reduced apoptosis by f45% after
12-h butyrate cotreatment. Similar results were observed in DHA
primed cells after 24-h butyrate cotreatment. In contrast, inhibition
of the uniporter had no effect on cells treated with LA plus butyrate
or butyrate alone at 12 and 24 h. Collectively, these results show
that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is required for the enhanced
apoptosis associated with DHA and butyrate cotreatment.
Kinetics of DHA and butyrate induction of mitochondrial
Ca2+ and apoptosis. To probe the functional proximity of
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in relation to the induction of
apoptosis, we analyzed the effects of treatment over time (6, 12,
and 24 h). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, cells treated with

butyrate and DHA exhibited a significantly (P < 0.0001) higher level
of mitochondrial Ca2+ compared with all other treatments as early
as 6 h. In contrast, the induction of apoptosis was not observed
until 12 h. These results indicate that the increase in mitochondrial
Ca2+ preceded the onset of apoptosis and therefore plays an
important role in triggering programmed cell death in colonic
mucosal cells.

Discussion
Dietary DHA (22:6n-3) has been extensively studied over the last
decade in relation to its role as a bioactive chemopreventive agent.
Past results from our laboratory have shown that DHA, when
combined with either a fermentable fiber source or butyrate,
enhances reactive oxygen species and LOOH production and
causes a change in mitochondrial permeability transition in
colonocytes (12–14, 35). Here, we report that DHA and butyrate
cotreatment also synergistically enhance apoptosis by up to 43% in
colonocyte cultures compared with butyrate alone (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In contrast, colonocytes treated with either DHA or LA
alone showed no significant increase in the level of apoptosis
compared with untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). From a
biological relevance perspective, these data are consonant with

Figure 5. Effect of RU-360 on apoptotic
index. YAMC cells were treated with
DHA or LA (50 Amol/L) for 48 h and
subsequently preincubated with 10 Amol/L
RU-360 for 30 min. Treated cells were then
coincubated with fatty acid with or without
5 mmol/L butyrate for the final 12 h (A) and
24 h (B). Nonadherent cells were
harvested, and nucleosomal fragmentation
was used to quantify apoptosis. Columns,

RU-360 significantly blocked apoptosis
with cells pretreated with the combination
of DHA and butyrate.

via a nonmitochondrial, Fas-mediated,
extrinsic pathway. DHA and butyrate,
in combination, synergistically perturb
intracellular Ca2+, stimulating mitochondrial
Ca2+ uptake. This directly or indirectly
decreases cytosolic Ca2+ and promotes
SOC-mediated entry via plasma
membrane channels. Mitochondrial
Ca2+ accumulation subsequently triggers
the opening of the permeability transition
pore (PTP ) and release of proapoptotic
molecules like cytochrome c and other
factors such as apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF ), and second mitochondrial activator
of caspases (smac/DIABLO ). Together,
these effects culminate in the induction
of procaspases and downstream caspases
that execute cellular apoptosis.

animal carcinogen studies showing that the bioactive components
of fermentable fiber (butyrate) and fish oil (DHA) coordinately
protect against colon tumorigenesis, primarily by increasing
apoptosis (3, 10, 11, 36). Further, our studies reveal that the
combination of DHA and butyrate, compared with butyrate alone,
further enhances apoptosis by additionally recruiting a Ca2+mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Based on our findings,
we propose a pathway for the induction of apoptosis in colonic
epithelium that involves the synergistic action of DHA and butyrate
on enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 6).
Over the last decade, extensive progress has been made in
establishing the effects of long-chain PUFA on various ions and ion
channels, including Ca2+ (37–39). With respect to a molecular
mechanism of action, agents that increase mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species/LOOH generation have been linked to a proapoptotic cycle involving Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and
mitochondrial loading (40). These data suggest that a change in
mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis may mediate the proapoptotic
effect of butyrate and DHA in colonocytes. The current experiments support this hypothesis because the combination of DHA
and butyrate produced the highest mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 3) while simultaneously decreasing free cytosolic Ca2+
levels (Fig. 1C and D). These data are consistent with our previous
finding that DHA primes the cell for butyrate-induced lipid
oxidation (14).
The role of mitochondria in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+
homeostasis and apoptotic signaling is well established (16–18).
Recent work has shown that mitochondria are closely juxtaposed
with the ER to effectively take up Ca2+ that is released from the ER.
There is also evidence of clustering of IP3 receptors on the ER
membrane facing the mitochondria (41, 42). Besides close physical
association of the ER and mitochondria, IP3 receptor–dependent
Ca2+ signals are associated with an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+,
which is capable of triggering apoptosis (22, 43). Consistent with
these observations, DHA-treated cultures exhibited a significant

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

accumulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ within 6 h of butyrate
cotreatment (Fig. 3A), preceding the onset of apoptosis that was
not increased until 12 h after butyrate cotreatment (Supplementary
Figs. S2B and 4).
To explore the connection between the accumulation of
mitochondrial Ca2+ and apoptosis, we examined the effect of a
mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor (RU-360). RU-360 significantly blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake after DHA and butyrate
cotreatment (Fig. 4) and partially blocked the induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 5). These outcomes provide evidence that an
increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels contribute directly to the
induction of apoptosis by DHA and butyrate cotreatment and the
change in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is not an epiphenomenon.
Despite the difficulties inherent to measuring mitochondrial
Ca2+ levels, both imaging and uniporter inhibitor data indicate that
Rhod-2 loads primarily into the mitochondria. With respect to how
mitochondria translate/interpret Ca2+ signals that ultimately
trigger apoptosis, it has been shown that multifactorial cross-talk
among Ca2+, ATP, and oxidative stress enhance cytochrome c
dislocation from the inner mitochondrial membrane and activate
Ca2+-dependent endonucleases, which are responsible for the
induction of the DNA fragmentation and apoptosis (44). There is
also evidence that mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration (via the
mitochondrial uniporter) results in the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which can induce the release of
proapoptotic molecules (i.e., Bax, Bak, cytochrome c), resulting in
mitochondrial-mediated (intrinsic) apoptosis (42, 45). This scenario
correlates well with our finding of a decrease in colonic
mitochondrial membrane potential in fish oil– but not corn oil–
fed rats (12, 13).
To elucidate the relative contribution of ER Ca2+ store emptying
versus SOC Ca2+ entry in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ responses were measured in a
Ca2+-free environment using EGTA. The removal of extracellular
Ca2+ effectively abolished the DHA and butyrate-induced decrease

in cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2). Following replenishment of
extracellular Ca2+, the difference in cytosolic Ca2+ between DHA
and butyrate versus control (LA and butyrate) treatment groups
was reestablished. These data suggest that Ca2+ influx through SOC
partly mediates the DHA and butyrate perturbation of intracellular
Ca2+. To corroborate the involvement of plasma membrane non–
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, SOC-dependent influx was also
antagonized using SKF-96365. SKF pretreatment eliminated the
difference in thapsigargin-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ levels between LA
plus butyrate and DHA plus butyrate treatment groups. These data
are consistent with previous observations in which DHA was found
to regulate intracellular signaling by modulating plasma membrane
Ca2+ entry (46), suggesting that the combination of DHA and
butyrate alters colonocyte-free cytosolic Ca2+ levels in part by
modulating SOC entry. Along these lines, growing evidence
suggests that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is
activated by both oxidative stress and Ca2+, whereas mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species inhibit SERCA pumps (47) and activate
SOC (48). In accordance with these findings, we have recently
shown in HCT-116 cells that a mitochondrion-specific antioxidant
blocks the DHA- and butyrate-induced induction of apoptosis.4
Further studies are needed to determine if these effects extend to
other members of the n-3 PUFA family, because a number of
studies have shown that EPA and DHA have similar effects on
biological membranes (1, 12, 13).
We have previously shown that butyrate induces colonocyte
apoptosis via a Fas receptor–mediated extrinsic pathway (23). In an
extension of our findings, we show for the first time that the
combination of DHA and butyrate, compared with butyrate alone,
further enhances apoptosis by additionally recruiting a Ca2+dependent mitochondrial-intrinsic pathway. Notably, DHAenriched mitochondria were sensitized to rapidly sequester Ca2+,

which served to trigger apoptosis in the presence of butyrate. This
could, in part, explain why the combination of dietary fish oil
(containing DHA) and pectin (which generates butyrate in the
lumen of the colon) seems to reduce tumor formation in the colon
by promoting apoptosis (3, 10, 13, and 35). Although previous
studies have examined the effects of PUFA to mobilize intracellular
Ca2+ (46, 49), it is apparent that DHA and butyrate work
coordinately in the colon to initiate a proapoptotic cycle involving
the activation of SOC, leading to rapid entry of Ca2+ through the
plasma membrane and mitochondrial Ca2+ loading (Fig. 6). With
regard to putative upstream mediators, we have shown that a
DHA-butyrate combination dissipates mitochondrial membrane
potential, an effect that was reversed by coincubation with
permeability transition pore inhibitors (14). This is consistent with
the fact that mitochondrial Ca2+ interacts with cyclophilin D, which
can trigger opening of the permeability pore (50). Although the
precise chronology of these events have not been elucidated, it is
likely that permeability transition pore opening, mitochondrial
lipid oxidation, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, and the
induction of apoptosis are all intimately linked.
In summary, recent data indicate that chemotherapeutic agents
that restore normal apoptotic pathways have the potential for
effectively treating cancers that depend on aberrations of the
apoptotic pathway to develop. Hence, it is of interest that DHA and
butyrate work coordinately in the colon to trigger a previously
unrecognized proapoptotic cycle involving mitochondrial Ca2+
loading. This may explain why a diet containing highly fermentable
fiber is only protective when fish oil is the lipid source.
