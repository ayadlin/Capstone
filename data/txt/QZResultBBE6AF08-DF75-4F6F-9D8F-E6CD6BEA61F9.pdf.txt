Abstract

Author Manuscript

The resistance of melanoma to current treatment modalities represents a major obstacle for durable
therapeutic response, and thus, the elucidation of mechanisms of resistance is urgently needed.
The crucial functions of Activating Transcription Factor-2 (ATF2) in the development and
therapeutic resistance of melanoma have been previously reported, although the precise underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report a protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε)- and Activating
Transcription Factor-2 (ATF2)-mediated mechanism that facilitates resistance by transcriptionally
repressing the expression of IFNβ1 and downstream type-I IFN signaling, which is otherwise
induced upon exposure to chemotherapy. Treatment of early stage melanomas expressing low
levels of PKCε with chemotherapies relieves its transcriptional repression of IFNB1, resulting in
impaired S-phase progression, a senescence-like phenotype, and increased cell death. This
response is lost in late stage metastatic melanomas expressing high levels of PKCε. Notably,
nuclear ATF2 and low expression of IFNβ1 in melanoma tumor samples correlates with poor
patient responsiveness to biochemotherapy or neoadjuvant IFN-α2a. Conversely, cytosolic ATF2
and induction of IFNβ1 coincides with therapeutic responsiveness. Collectively, we identify an

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Human melanoma, characterized by aggressive metastatic behavior and the ability to rapidly
develop therapeutic resistance, represents one of the most lethal forms of skin cancer.
Despite the advent of effective targeted monotherapies, such as the mutant BRAF kinase
inhibitors vemurafenib (PLX4720) and dabrafenib, most melanomas eventually develop
28
therapeutic resistance that drives relapse and progression . A number of studies have
identified genetic and epigenetic mechanisms through which melanomas can acquire
resistance to mutant B-RAF inhibitors, including mutation of RAS, MEK, and ERK, and
11 19 32
upregulation of PDGF and COT , , —all of which contribute to reactivation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway. Other therapeutic
modalities for melanoma include agents that inhibit immune response checkpoints, including
8 22 31
7 30
CTLA-4 , , and PD1 , , and immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN9
α2a , have exhibited variable efficacy. In addition, chemo- and biochemotherapeutic
regimens (for example, chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin, vinblastine, or dacarbazine, alone
or in combination with IFN-α2a or IL-2), have been limited in efficacy and are considered as
523 26
palliative modalities for late stage metastatic melanoma patients , . In general, the
overall therapeutic success for melanomas has been limited by our insufficient
understanding of mechanisms—beyond the MAPK signaling pathway—that facilitate
resistance and by our inability to identify patients who might be most responsive to specific
therapies.

Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF2), a member of the Activator Protein-1 (AP1) helixloop-helix transcription factor family, elicits both oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions,
depending on its subcellular localization. We previously reported that in melanoma cells
subjected to genotoxic stress (a common outcome of most anti-cancer therapies), ATF2
localizes to the cytoplasm where it acts as a tumor suppressor by perturbing the VDAC1/
14
HXK1 complex at the mitochondrial outer membrane and promoting apoptosis . In
contrast, phosphorylation of ATF2 on threonine 52 (T52) by protein kinase C epsilon
(PKCε) promotes the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of ATF2, rendering the
cells resistant to chemotherapeutic stress. In successive stages of melanoma progression,
levels of both PKCε and nuclear ATF2 are increased and correlate with poorer clinical
14
outcome , suggesting that the PKCε-ATF2 signaling axis contributes to tumorigenesis and
chemoresistance. Notably, PKCε was previously identified among the top 10 kinases that
11
can confer resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma , and importantly, a recent study
identified ATF2 as a crucial mediator of resistance to Sorafenib in liver cancer,
24
demonstrating that loss of ATF2 is sufficient to revert resistance . Consistent with this
notion, synthetic peptides or small molecule inhibitors that attenuate the phosphorylation of

ATF2 by PKCε, promote its cytoplasmic localization, and thus inhibit its transcriptional

activity can sensitize melanoma cells to death , . However, the precise transcriptional
program coordinated by PKCε and ATF2 to drive chemoresistance is not yet known. Here,
we report that the PKCε-ATF2 signaling axis facilitates resistance in melanoma by
repressing the tumor suppressive, therapeutic stress-induced expression of IFNβ1.

We previously showed that phosphorylation of ATF2 by PKCε on threonine 52 (pATF2)
promotes its nuclear retention and transcriptional activation in melanoma cells, conferring
14
resistance to chemotherapeutic stress . Indeed, the expression of either the phosphomimic
ATF2T52E or a constitutively active form of PKCε (caPKCε) renders WM793 melanoma
cells resistant to the chemotherapeutic (genotoxic) stress induced by etoposide (ETO) or
14
cisplatin (CIS), reducing cell death by ~50% (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 1a, lower; ). To
determine the mechanism by which the activation of the PKCε-ATF2 signaling axis imparts
chemotherapeutic resistance, we performed gene expression profiling of WM793 cells that
were first depleted of endogenous ATF2 and then reconstituted with either ATF2T52E or the
non-phosphorylatable mutant ATF2T52A, which is predominantly cytoplasmic/mitochondrial
14
and is transcriptionally inactive (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We identified the top 100 genes
that were significantly upregulated or downregulated upon ETO treatment of ATF2T52Eexpressing compared to ATF2T52A-expressing cells (Supplementary Table 1). Of these
genes, Interferon signaling was identified as the most significantly altered canonical
signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. 1b, left), in which Interferon Beta 1 (IFNB1) and the
IFN-related genes SP110, IRF9, and IFI144L were significantly downregulated in ETOtreated ATF2T52E-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b, right), suggesting that pATF2
represses IFN pathway components. qRT-PCR analysis of IFNB1 transcripts confirmed that
ETO and CIS treatments increased IFNβ1 mRNA levels by ~4–5-fold and ~3-fold,
respectively, in WM793 cells (Fig. 1b, left). This induction of IFN β 1 by ETO or by CIS,
was reduced by ~60-70% or ~40-60% by the expression of ATF2T52E or wild-type ATF2,
respectively (Fig. 1b, right). Consistent with these observations, ETO treatment increased
the expression of both IFNβ1 and SP110 by ~4-5-fold in melanoma cells with low levels of
PKCε/pATF2 (WM793) and by ~2-fold in cells with intermediate levels (LU1205), but had
no effect in cells with high levels of PKCε/pATF2 (501Mel; Supplementary Figs. 1a, 1c, 1d,
and 1e). This relationship between PKCε/pATF2 levels and IFN-related gene expression was
also observed for the downstream IFNβ1 effectors IFIT2, ISG56, OAS1, and PKR, thereby
establishing that PKCε/pATF2 levels repress chemotherapeutic stress-induced IFNβ1
expression and signaling (Supplementary Fig. 1f). In addition, treatment of WM793 cells
33
with SBI-410, a small molecule inhibitor of PKCε-mediated phosphorylation of ATF2 ,
dose-dependently induced IFNB1 transcription (~2-to-9-fold; Supplementary Fig. 1g).
Moreover, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCε resulted in increased expression of
IFNB1 transcripts both at baseline and during ETO treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1h)
Finally, we confirmed that ETO treatment increased IFNβ1 protein production by ~2.5-fold
in WM793 cells (Fig. 1c), and to a lower degree in LU1205 (~1.8-fold) and 501Mel (~1.2fold) cells. Similar effects were observed following CIS treatment (Fig. 1c). This induction

was also blocked by the expression of ATF2T52E or caPKCε (Fig. 1d). Together, these data
indicate that PKCε-ATF2 repress the stress-induced expression of IFNβ1 and its downstream
signaling effectors.
PKCε-phosphorylated ATF2 binds the IFNB1 promoter to repress transcription

Author Manuscript

To determine whether pATF2 directly represses IFNB1 transcription in melanoma cells
subjected to chemotherapeutic stress, we examined ATF2 binding to the IFNB1 promoter in
501Mel cells, which express high levels of PKCε and pATF2 and which failed to upregulate
IFNB1 in response to stress (Supplementary Fig. 1a,e). Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP)-PCR analysis revealed high levels of the IFNB1 5′ promoter sequence in ATF2
immunoprecipitates from cells incubated with or without ETO, suggesting that ATF2 binds
constitutively to the IFNB1 promoter to repress transcription in cells exhibiting high levels
of PKCε (Fig. 2a, left). In LU1205 cells that moderately upregulated IFNB1 following
chemotherapeutic stress, ChIP analysis revealed a ~20% reduction of ATF2 binding to the
IFNB1 promoter (Fig. 2a, right), supporting the notion that the presence of ATF2 on the
IFNB1 promoter suppresses its transcription, whereas its absence following genotoxic stress
promotes it.

Author Manuscript

The IFNB1 5′ promoter contains 4 putative AP1 sites that could serve as ATF2 binding sites.
To test this, we generated luciferase constructs containing varying combinations of the
IFNB1 promoter AP1 sites (E1, E2, E3, and E4; Fig. 2b), and evaluated their activity in
WM793 cells co-expressing empty vector or ATF2T52E. ETO and CIS treatment induced
luciferase expression ~2-fold in cells expressing the full length (FL) construct (containing
E1-E4) (Fig. 2b lower, 2c), consistent with the effects of chemotherapeutic stress on
endogenous IFNB1. Constructs consisting of the E3 domain alone (#3) or E3+E4 domains
(#4) exhibited ~2-4-fold higher luciferase activity compared with cells expressing the FL
construct, in the presence or absence of ETO (Fig. 2c), suggesting the presence of a
transcriptional activating element. However, only the E1-containing FL and E1-3 (#123)
constructs were transcriptionally repressed by ATF2T52E, suggesting that the E1 element is
required for pATF2-mediated transcriptional suppression (Fig. 2d). Indeed, mutation of the
AP1 consensus-binding motif in E1 abrogated the ATF2T52E transcriptional repression
(ΔE1; Fig. 2e). These data indicate that pATF2 represses IFNB1 transcription by binding to
the E1 element within the 5’-UTR of the IFNB1 gene.
IFNβ1 induction results in delayed S-phase and a senescence-like phenotype

Author Manuscript

To determine the biological action of IFNβ1 in melanoma cells, we examined 2- and 3dimensional growth in WM793 cells overexpressing IFNB1 or 501Mel cells treated with
exogenous recombinant human IFNβ1, respectively, and found that both treatments
significantly impaired melanoma cell proliferation when grown in standard tissue culture
conditions as well as in 3-dimensional spheroid culture (Fig. 3a, left and right). Furthermore,
IFNβ1 treatment effectively doubled the proportion of LU1205 cells in the S and G2 phases
of the cell cycle compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3b). In addition, the number of cells in
S-phase was ~10% higher in cultures treated with both IFNβ1 and ETO compared with ETO
alone (Fig. 3b). These data indicate that IFNβ1 treatment promotes the accumulation of cells
in S-phase and is sufficient, when applied as a single agent, to double the S-phase

population. We posited that this effect of IFNβ1 might be due to activation of the intra-Sphase checkpoint. Indeed, immunostaining for the DNA repair protein Mre11 revealed that
IFNβ1 treatment increased the frequency of bulky Mre11-positive DNA repair foci by ~40%
18
(Fig. 3c), consistent with the accumulation of cells in late S-phase . These data therefore
demonstrate that IFNβ1 impairs S-G2 phase progression.

Author Manuscript

We next asked whether inhibition of IFNβ1 signaling might reverse the cell cycle effects of
ETO. To this end, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of the IFNβ1 receptor subunit
IFNAR2 in WM793 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a) and assessed cell cycle progression and
viability under chemotherapeutic stress. Control cells expressing scrambled shRNA
exhibited a ~30% increase in S-G2 phase cells and increased dead/dying cells following
exposure to ETO (Fig. 3d,e). In contrast, knockdown of IFNAR2 increased the percentage of
ETO-treated cells in G1 (~15-20%), and reduced S-phase accumulation and cell death by
~10% and ~13%, respectively, compared to control ETO-treated cells (Fig. 3d,e). A similar
reduction of chemotherapeutic stress-induced cell death and increase in G1-phase cells was
observed in cells overexpressing caPKCε or ATF2T52E compared to empty vector-expressing
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b), consistent with the cell cycle changes being driven by PKCεATF2-mediated signaling.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, the effects of IFNβ1 and ETO on the cell cycle were accompanied by a
senescence-like phenotype characterized by the increased activity of senescence-associated
ß-galactosidase (SA-ß-gal) and the expression of senescence markers including DEC1,
DCR2, and p21, but not p16, p53 or p27 (Fig. 4a). Despite this profile, the cells treated with
ETO and/or IFNβ1 continued to proliferate, albeit at a greatly reduced rate (Fig. 3a and data
not shown). The mutant B-RAF inhibitor PLX4720 has also been shown to induce SA-ß-gal
6
activity . In agreement, PLX4720 treatment of WM793 cells increased SA-ß-gal activity
(Fig. 4a) and also induced the transcription of IFNB1 (Fig. 4b), similar to the effects of ETO
and CIS. These results indicate that the therapeutic stress-induced expression of IFNB1 in
melanoma cells results in impaired SG2 transit that is characterized by increased DNA
repair foci and a senescence-like phenotype.
IFNβ1 co-treatment enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that the IFNβ1-induced S-phase accumulation might enhance the
sensitivity of melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents or PLX4720. Indeed, we found
that whereas treatment with IFNβ1 alone was not significantly cytotoxic, the toxicity of ETO
(by ~30%) and PLX4720 (by ~40%) was significantly enhanced by co-treatment with IFNβ1
(Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). These results suggest that the cell cycle-altering effects
of IFNβ1 can sensitize melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic chemotherapeutic agents as well
as to PLX4720. In support of this notion, whereas the overexpression of caPKCε or
ATF2T52E suppressed ETO-induced cell death to ~13 or 10%, respectively, compared to
~27% cell death in EV-expressing cells, the cooverexpression of IFNB1 was sufficient to
significantly overcome caPKCε- or ATF2 T52E-mediated resistance to ETO, restoring cell
death induction to ~35% (Fig. 4d).
Taken together, these results indicate that IFNβ1 signaling status contributes to the
responsiveness of melanoma cells to stress—intact IFNβ1 signaling sensitizes cells to stress,

whereas loss of IFNβ1 signaling under stress conditions is protective. These findings support
a tumor suppressor role for cell autonomous IFNβ1 signaling in melanoma cells—consistent
with the previously observed function of PKCε-phosphorylated ATF2.
Effects of chemotherapeutic stress-induced IFNβ1 expression in melanoma cells are cell
autonomous
We next asked whether chemotherapeutic stress-induced IFNβ1 expression in melanoma
cells might also elicit cell non-autonomous effects, such as immune cell-mediated tumor
clearance. To test this, we performed co-culture experiments using the B6-derived murine
20
melanoma cell line YUMM1.3 and splenic lymphocytes from syngeneic wild-type B6
mice carrying YUMM1.3 tumors. The YUMM1.3 cells were modified to express GFP and
ATF2T34E (murine ATF2T52E equivalent) or empty vector, allowing direct assessment of the
contribution of pATF2 (Fig. 5a).

Author Manuscript

Treatment of YUMM1.3 cells with ionizing irradiation (IR; 5 or 10 Gy, for 24 h) alone, a
therapeutic stress that can be targeted specifically to the melanoma cells but not to the
lymphocytes, effectively reduced cell viability by ~40%. The addition of a neutralizing antiIFNβ1 antibody attenuated cell death (~25% increased viability) in cells exposed to 5 Gy IR,
and to a lesser extent, after 10 Gy IR, indicating that IR-induced death was at least partially
dependent on IFNβ1 (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the addition of
lymphocytes decreased (~20%) the viability of non-irradiated YUMM1.3 cells, the
lymphocytes did not significantly reduce the viability of irradiated YUMM1.3 cells
compared with irradiated YUMM1.3 cells alone. Furthermore, the addition of an anti-IFNβ1
antibody to these co-cultures did not affect cell viability compared with YUMM1.3 cells
cultured in the absence of lymphocytes. Intriguingly, the addition of lymphocytes to cultures
of ATF2T34E-expressing YUMM1.3 cells, which were refractory to irradiation, did not
decrease cell viability (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that
the IR-induced expression of IFNβ1 in the melanoma cells elicited minimal additional
effects in triggering lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell death in our co-culture system.
Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of the co-cultures revealed that the irradiated
YUMM1.3 cells did not further activate CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells, NKp46+ NK cells, or
GR-1+ lymphocytes (Supplementary Figs. 4a-d) compared with non-irradiated cells,
whereas the neutralizing IFNβ1 antibody abolished their basal activation state
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Together, these data indicate that the changes observed in melanoma cells following altered
IFNβ1 expression are predominantly due to cell autonomous effects.

Subcellular localization of ATF2 and expression of IFNβ1 in human melanomas correlates
with therapeutic responsiveness
We next investigated whether ATF2 and IFNβ1 status in melanoma tumors might associate
with clinical outcome. We hypothesized that after treatment, tumors exhibiting cytoplasmic
accumulation of ATF2 and induction of IFNβ1 would correlate with therapeutic
responsiveness, whereas those exhibiting nuclear enrichment of ATF2 and no induction or
reduction of IFNβ1 would correlate with non-responsiveness to therapy. To this end, we

examined pre- and post-treatment melanoma tumor samples obtained from three medical
centers.

Author Manuscript

The first cohort of patients specimens assessed were paired pre- and post-treatment
melanoma tumor sections obtained from elective surgeries on 9 AJCC stage IIIc/IV
cutaneous melanoma patients who were administered combinatorial biochemotherapy
12 13
(Cisplatin, Dacarbazine, Vinblastine, Interleukin-2, and Interferon-α2a) , , DTIC,
Temodar, Interferon-α2a, Interleukin-2, and/or had radiation (gamma knife) with several
years follow-up (John Wayne Cancer Institute, CA). ATF2 localization (nuclear vs.
cytoplasmic) and IFNβ1 levels were examined and compared, by blinded analysis, between
the patient-matched pre- and post-treatment tissue sections by immunofluorescence
microscopy and were found to correlate with clinical responsiveness (time to progression)
for 7 of the 9 patients assessed as follows: 3 of 3 patients exhibiting poor responses and 4 of
6 patients exhibiting favorable responses (Supplementary Figs. 5a,b, 6a). Further, a separate
cohort of 8 non-treated melanoma patients specimens and 15 drug-treated non-responder
specimens (from patients who had progressed/recurred rapidly on treatment) demonstrated a
9-fold reduction in IFNβ1 expression, as determined by qRT-PCR analysis, consistent with
the transcriptional repression of IFNβ1 in non-responsive patients (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
Drug therapies for the treated patients included Ipilimumab, MEK inhibitor, Vemurafenib,
Interferon-α2a, Abraxane, and/or Avastin.

Author Manuscript

Since pATF2 was associated with downregulated IFNβ1 and its downstream effectors, we
assessed the possibility that the status of ATF2 and IFNβ1 might correlate with
responsiveness to IFN-based therapy. Thus, we examined pre- and post-treatment tumor
sections from in an independent cohort of 12 melanoma patients who were administered
single-agent neoadjuvant IFN-α2a (University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Melanoma
Center). Blinded scoring and comparison of the patient-matched sections for changes in
ATF2 localization and IFNβ1 expression before and after treatment revealed a strong
association with clinical responsiveness (time to progression) in 8 of 12 patients: 3 of 4
patients exhibiting poor responses and 5 of 8 patients exhibiting favorable responses (Fig.
6a,b; Supplementary Fig. 6b). Consistent with these findings, analyses of pre- and post-IFNα2a-treated tumor samples from 5 non-responder patients (from the University of Zurich)
revealed reduced IFNβ1 and nuclear ATF2 staining (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

CD8+ T-cell infiltration and intratumoral proliferation represents an important component of
4
anti-tumor immunity , and thus we examined whether the samples from the
biochemotherapy and IFN-α2a patient cohorts exhibited a correlation between the presence
of CD8+ T-cells, patient responsiveness, and ATF2/IFNβ1 status. In this analysis, we
hypothesized that the presence of CD8+ T-cells after treatment would correlate with
responsiveness, whereas lack of CD8+ T-cells would correlate with non-responsiveness. By
immunofluorescence assessment of the biochemotherapy cohort samples, we found that 5 of
9 patients exhibited increased CD8+ T-cell populations in responders and but not in nonresponders (Fig. 6c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). In the IFN-α2a cohort, 6 of 12 patients
exhibited increased CD8+ T-cell populations in responders and but not in non-responders
(Fig. 6c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Notably, in both cohorts, the patients that exhibited
a correlation of CD8+ T-cell populations with responsiveness or non-responsiveness were

also patients whose responses also correlated with ATF2 and IFNβ1 status. These
observations suggest that although the therapeutic stress-induced expression of IFNβ1 that
we observe in melanoma cells is insufficient to trigger lymphocyte activation/infiltration, it
does not preclude the presence/proliferation of intra-tumoral CD8+ T-cell populations,
which are likely affected by mechanisms that are independent of the therapy-induced, ATF2regulated expression of IFNb1.

Author Manuscript

Taken together, the analyses of patient samples support our mechanistic data, which indicate
that the transcriptional repression of IFNβ1 expression by PKCε-ATF2 drives melanoma
resistance. In addition, we also assessed the status of ATF2 and IFNβ1 in a cohort of 17
melanoma patients who were treated with IL-2 at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the
University of Colorado, and we did not observe a significant correlation between these
proteins and patient responsiveness (data not shown), suggesting that this mechanism of
resistance might apply to specific therapeutic modalities. Nonetheless, in the other treatment
cohorts, we find that the profile of ATF2 localization and IFNβ1 expression appears to
correlate with clinical responsiveness (time to progression) in ~70% of the patients
examined; additional independent larger-cohort studies are required to further substantiate
these observations.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The development of resistance to advanced and specific therapies represents a continuing
challenge for effective and durable treatment responses of melanoma. Improving our
understanding of the crucial mechanisms that propel resistance in melanoma will aid in the
improvement and development of current and future therapeutic modalities, as well as
potentially, patient stratification, which would represent a major advance for the treatment of
melanoma. Here, we report a previously undisclosed molecular mechanism that facilitates
the development of the resistance of melanoma to therapeutic stress.

Author Manuscript

Our data demonstrate that PKCε-phosphorylated ATF2 downregulates IFNβ1 expression
(and signaling), which promotes the resistance of melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic
agents, as well as the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (the model compound for PLX4032/
Vemurafenib). Phosphorylated ATF2 directly represses IFNB1 transcription, and attenuating
ATF2-mediated suppression enables the induction of IFNB1 and its tumor suppressive
effects. We found that the stress-induced expression of IFNβ1 elicits predominantly cell
autonomous effects on melanoma cells—which might be explained by the fact that
chemotherapy induces ~2.5-fold increases in IFNβ1 protein levels, whereas infectious
stimuli (i.e., viral infection or LPS exposure) that elicit immune responses have been
10 16 34
reported to induce IFNβ1 to levels on the order of thousands of fold increase , , . The
chemotherapy-induced IFNβ1 impairs growth and proliferation by altering cell cycle
dynamics and inducing the accumulation of cells in S-G2 phases, and sensitizing melanoma
cells to death.
Melanomas are notorious for their propensity for developing resistance to a range of
9 17 21 29
therapies, including DNA-damaging agents , , , . We found that the upregulation of
PKCε-ATF2 signaling and subsequent repression of IFNB1 in cells exposed to

chemotherapeutic stress is sufficient to alter cell cycle dynamics and to reduce the
population of cells in S-phase, identifying one mechanism by which melanomas develop
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Indeed, the expression of constitutively active PKCε
or pATF2 renders melanoma cells with low endogenous levels of PKCε/pATF2 less
responsive to the cytotoxic effects of IFNβ1 and/or ETO (Supplementary Fig. 7). It is
possible that, by driving the nuclear localization and activity of ATF2, PKCε might also
2
promote the DNA repair function of ATF2 , further contributing to enhanced melanoma
survival during therapeutic stress—a point that deserves further investigation. That PKCεATF2 reduced IFNβ1/ETO responsiveness (measured by cell death) by only ~50% suggests
that other downstream ATF2-dependent and ATF2-independent mechanisms also contribute
to the development of therapeutic resistance. Of note, the correlation of intratumoral CD8+
T-cells populations, ATF2/IFNβ1 status, and patient responsiveness that we observed in the
biochemotherapy cohort samples, but not in our co-culture studies, implies an effect of
PKCε-ATF2 on the proliferation of intratumoral CD8+ T-cells rather than the recruitment of
CD8+ T-cells. Further studies on how ATF2 modulates intratumoral immune responses are
warranted.

Our findings are corroborated by the analyses of samples from melanoma patients before
and after biochemotherapy/chemotherapy/radiation treatment, as well as neoadjuvant IFNα2a therapy. Accordingly, tumors from patients classified as therapeutic responders
exhibited increased levels of cytoplasmic (transcriptionally inert) ATF2 and correspondingly
increased IFNβ1 levels. Conversely, non-responders exhibited nuclear ATF2 and unaltered or
reduced levels of IFNβ1 after treatment. These findings therefore offer mechanistic insight
into the development of therapeutic resistance through downregulation of a MAPK pathwayindependent molecular mechanism that would otherwise sensitize tumor cells to
chemotherapeutic/therapeutic stress. Such alterations correlated with the clinical
responsiveness of the majority of patients we evaluated, suggesting that PKCε-ATF2-IFNβ1
signaling plays an important role in melanoma resistance and progression in patients.
Further, our data suggest that ATF2 and IFNβ1 might represent novel markers of clinical
responsivess, a possibility that requires further assessment in a large cohort studies. Findings
from recent clinical studies support the possibility that the mechanism (and ATF2/IFNβ1
profile) that we have identified extends beyond melanoma to other types of cancers. For
example, the expression of type-1 IFNs (including IFNβ1) was recently found to correlate
with biochemical recurrence and metastasis in prostate and breast cancer patients,
3 27
respectively, although the underlying mechanism was unclear in those studies , . Further,
recent in vitro studies suggest that tumor stroma-derived IFNβ1, such as adipose tissue, also
25
elicits tumor-suppressive effects , and the treatment of other cancer cell types, including
hepatocellular carcinoma cells, with IFNβ1, was recently found to elicit similar cell cycle
15 35
alterations and cell death as those identified in our study , .
Importantly, the results of this study also suggest the potential therapeutic value of agents
that can promote ATF2 cytoplasmic localization, thereby derepressing IFNβ1 transcription.
We previously showed that the inhibition of PKCε-mediated phosphorylation of ATF2
promotes its accumulation at the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it contributes to
14
stress-induced mitochondrial leakage . Our subsequent high-content microscopy-based
screen identified two compounds that trigger the cytoplasmic/mitochondrial localization of

ATF2, simultaneously blocking its transcriptional activity . Of those, SBI-0089410
effectively induced the expression of IFNB1 (Supplementary Fig. 1g), supporting the
possibility that such compounds could enhance the chemosensitivity of melanoma cells by
both promoting the mitochondrial function of ATF2 and by simultaneously derepressing
IFNβ1 signaling.

In conclusion, our study has identified a molecular mechanism that underlies the oncogenic
function of ATF2, as reflected in its ability to drive chemoresistance of melanomas. PKCε,
14
which we previously found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma , and which is one of
11
the top 10 kinases that can confer resistance in melanoma to mutant BRAF inhibition ,
phosphorylates ATF2 and triggers the downregulation of IFNβ1 signaling, which we have
now shown determines the therapeutic responsiveness of melanoma cells by modulating cell
cycle dynamics and sensitivity to stress induced by chemotherapeutic therapeutic agents.
Notably, the recent finding that ATF2 mediates sorafenib resistance in liver cancer suggests
that the mechanism of therapeutic resistance that we have uncovered might represent a mode
of resistance that pertains to other types of cancers beyond melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
Antibodies and immunostaining reagents

Author Manuscript

Antibodies employed were purchased as follows: ATF2 (C-19 for immunoblotting and
C-19X for ChIP assays), PKCε (C15), IFNb1 (E-20, for immunostaining of sections) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (CA, USA); IFNb1 (AP18065PU-N, for intracellular FACS
and immunoneutralization assays) from Acris (USA); β-tubulin (E7-s) from Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, USA); pT52-ATF2 (Phosphosolutions, USA).
For immunofluorescent staining of ATF2 in patient sections, we used a polyclonal antibody
made by SDIX, LLC against the amino acid residues 129-278.
DNA constructs and transfection
DNA plasmids were all transfected using JetPrime (Polyplus, France) or Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, USA) according to manufacturers’ protocols. The constitutively active
HIS-tagged PKCε construct was a generous gift from Dr. Jorge Moscat. Other plasmids
14
were previously described .

Flow cytometric analyses
Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were seeded at 1X105 cells per well into 6-well tissue culture
plates and treated the next day as indicated in the figure legend. Following treatment, cells
were harvested by trypsinization and fixed in 70% EtOH in PBS. After a single wash in
PBS, the cells were stained in cell cycle staining buffer (60 μg/ml propidium iodide/0.15
mg/ml RNAse A (Sigma)). After incubation for 20 min, the cells were immediately analyzed
by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), n = 10,000 cells (within G1-to-G2 gates) per
