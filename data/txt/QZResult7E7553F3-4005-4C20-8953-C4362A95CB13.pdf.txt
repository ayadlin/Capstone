Downstaging after neoadjuvant treatment is increasingly used as a prognostic factor and surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. However, in
recent trials of neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil–based chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer, downstaging did not translate into a benefit with
regard to either disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival. By analyzing the 10-year outcome data of the German CAO/ARO/AIO-94
phase 3 trial, the authors demonstrated that significantly fewer patients had poor prognostic features (eg, ypT3-4, ypN1-2) after preoperative 5-fluorouracil–based chemoradiotherapy. Nevertheless, these patients with International Union for Cancer Control stage II disease
were found to be at a higher risk of developing distant metastases and had poorer DFS compared with patients with corresponding TNM
tumor (sub)groups in the postoperative treatment arm, whereas patients with International Union for Cancer Control stage III disease
demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a worse outcome after preoperative treatment. Overall, DFS remained identical in both treatment arms. Thus, “downstage migration” after neoadjuvant treatment resembles the reverse of the Will Rogers phenomenon and thereC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, postoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiotherapy (5-FU-CRT) has been shown to improve survival over surgery alone among patients with histopathologically confirmed International Union for Cancer Control
(UICC) stage II and III rectal cancer.1,2 The CAO/AIO/ARO-94 phase 3 trial of the German Rectal Cancer Study Group
demonstrated the superiority of preoperative versus postoperative 5-FU-CRT with regard to local control and treatment
compliance.3 Recently, the 10-year follow-up outcomes of this trial confirmed the original findings.4 Two other randomized trials from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 22921) and the Federation
Francophone de Cancerologie Digestive (FFCD 9293) reported the superiority of preoperative 5-FU-CRT over preoperative radiotherapy with respect to local control rates.5,6
A common finding of these 3 large randomized trials of preoperative 5-FU-CRT in patients with clinically staged
UICC stage II and II rectal cancer was a statistically significant UICC downstaging effect after neoadjuvant 5-FU-CRT compared with primary surgery or preoperative radiotherapy alone before surgery. Patients who experience downstaging are
reported to have a more favorable long-term prognosis.7 However, it is interesting to note that in none of the 3 recent trials
did this effect translate into an improved disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival for the entire treatment arm. Herein,
we propose an explanation of this finding that resembles the reverse of the Will Rogers stage migration phenomenon.
In general, stage migration occurs with careful staging of cancer. For example, upstaging of UICC stages I and II to
stage III colorectal cancer may occur by increasing the number of lymph nodes examined, as well as through the advent of

modern methods,8,9 which in turn may improve the prognosis of patients with UICC stages I/II and III disease
without any changes in individual outcomes or the prognosis of the entire group.10,11 Conversely, one could ask if
“downstage migration,” as observed after preoperative 5FU-CRT, is associated with a worse outcome for corresponding ypTN categories and UICC stages without
altering the individual outcomes or the outcome for the
entire treatment arm? Or, in other words, is the outcome
of a patient with, for example, ypT3N0 disease after neoadjuvant 5-FU-CRT different from that of a patient who
received postoperative 5-FU-CRT for a pT3N0 tumor?
In the CAO/AIO/ARO-94 phase 3 trial, patients
with cT3-4 and/or cN1 rectal cancer were included after
clinical staging with endorectal ultrasound and computed
tomography. A total of 799 patients were randomized to
receive preoperative 5-FU-CRT followed by total mesorectal excision surgery or immediate total mesorectal excision and postoperative 5-FU-CRT. Patients were well
matched with regard to pretreatment cT and cN categories.3,4 To assess downstaging, we used the chi-square test
to compare percentages (ie, the T, N and UICC stages of
disease). Preoperative 5-FU-CRT resulted in significant
downshifts of the ypT and ypN categories and, consequently, UICC downstaging compared with primary surgery: (y)pT0, (y)pT1, (y)pT2, (y)pT3, and (y)pT4: 10%,

SPSS software (version 16; SPSS, IBM Corporation,
Armonk, NY).
Surviving patients were followed for a median of
134 months (range, 50-184 months). Here, we performed
a subgroup analysis of the 10-year cumulative incidence
for local and distant recurrences and DFS in patients who
actually received protocol-specified treatment before or
after curative surgery (R0, no distant metastases, M0),
and in whom data regarding the 2002 UICC TNM (sub)staging were available (Table 1).12 This was a multiple test
situation, and no correction was applied. Recurrence rates
and DFS were derived from Kaplan-Meier estimates;
2-sided P values for the comparison of incidences were
based on the log-rank test.

Commentary

Figure 1. Disease-free survival is shown for all patients treated
with curative resection who received protocol-specified treatment, according to (Top) treatment arm and (Bottom) treatment arm and (y)pN categories. Preop indicates preoperative;
CRT, chemoradiotherapy; Postop, postoperative.

For the entire cohort of patients treated with curative resection, the 10-year cumulative incidence of local
disease recurrence was slightly but insignificantly reduced
among those treated on the preoperative 5-FU-CRT arm
(5.5% vs 7.5%; P 5 .20) (Table 1). This reduction was
mainly due to the low incidence of local recurrence among
patients with pathologic complete response (ypT0N0)
and ypT1-2N0 disease, whereas the risk of local disease recurrence in patients with stage II and III disease after neoadjuvant 5-FU-CRT was found to be similar to that of the
patients treated with postoperative 5-FU-CRT for the
corresponding UICC (sub)stages (Table 1). It is interesting to note that patients with stage I disease after immediate surgery, who were apparently overstaged by endorectal
ultrasound and therefore did not receive adjuvant 5-FUCRT, had a slightly higher incidence of local and distant
disease recurrence compared with patients with UICC
stage II disease who received postoperative 5-FU-CRT
(Table 1).
1726

The 10-year cumulative incidence of distant metastases and the 10-year DFS rate were identical in both the
preoperative and postoperative treatment arms for the
entire group of patients treated with curative resection
(Table 1) (Fig. 1 Top). However, both endpoints were
significantly poorer in patients with UICC stage II disease
after preoperative 5-FU-CRT compared with patients in
the postoperative arm who received 5-FU-CRT for the
corresponding UICC (sub)stages (Table 1). A plausible
explanation for this outcome could be that the group of
patients with UICC stage II disease after neoadjuvant 5FU-CRT included those with a good prognosis (ie,
patients who never experienced lymph node metastases)
and those with initially involved pelvic lymph nodes who
were sterilized by preoperative 5-FU-CRT. The latter
group most likely exhibits a higher risk of developing distant metastases. An additional explanation may be that
significantly fewer lymph nodes were found and examined
after preoperative 5-FU-CRT compared with primary
surgery (median number, 15 lymph nodes vs 22 lymph
nodes; P <.001). Thus, lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant 5-FU-CRT may be missed simply due to the
reduced number of lymph nodes available for the histopathologic staging.
For patients with UICC stage III disease, although
the 10-year cumulative incidence of distant metastases
was 9.3% higher and the DFS rate was 8.8% poorer in the
preoperative versus postoperative CRT arms, these differences were not found to be statistically significant (Table
1). Persistent lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant 5FU-CRT could reflect a more aggressive phenotype of
malignant cells that have spread to the regional lymphatics
and are resistant toward 5-FU-CRT. As a result, these
patients are at higher risk of developing distant metastases.
Figure 1 (Bottom) shows DFS grouped according to
(y)pN categories. All subgroups demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward poorer DFS after preoperative CRT
compared with postoperative CRT, although the DFS
was completely identical for the entire group (Fig. 1 Top).
The results of the current study demonstrate that
significant UICC downstaging occurs after preoperative
5-FU-CRT. Patients with a pathological complete
response (ypT0N0) and those downstaged to UICC stage
I demonstrate excellent DFS that is in keeping with our
recently reported data concerning the prognostic value of
tumor regression grading in patients with rectal cancer.13
It is interesting to note that although tumor regression
grading identifies subgroups of patients who will have a
better prognosis if treated homogeneously with preoperative CRT,13 it does not signify a better DFS for the whole

group of preoperatively treated patients. However,
patients with UICC stage II disease after preoperative
CRT exhibit poorer DFS and are at higher risk of developing distant metastases compared with their UICC
(sub)stage counterparts who received CRT after primary
surgery, whereas a nonsignificant trend toward a worse
outcome was noted for patients with UICC stage III disease after preoperative CRT. As a result, DFS for the
entire group of patients remains unchanged, resembling
the reverse of the Will Rogers phenomenon. Thus, downstaging after neoadjuvant treatment may not be a reliable
endpoint when assessing the efficacy of treatment alternatives on long-term survival outcomes in clinical trials.
