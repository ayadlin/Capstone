Abstract
IFN-A is commonly used for biotherapy of neuroendocrine
carcinomas. However, its antitumor efficacy is often limited
due to IFN resistance. In this study, we evaluate the role of
suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) in
modulating the effects of type I IFNs (IFN-A and IFN-B) in
human neuroendocrine BON1 and CM tumor cells. In both
cell lines, type I IFNs activated signal transducers and
activators of transcription (STAT) and significantly decreased
cell viability. However, the effects of IFN-B were significantly
more pronounced than those of IFN-A and involved the
induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as shown by
cleavage of caspase-8, Bid, and caspase-9. Stable overexpression of SOCS1 completely abolished the apoptotic effects of
both type I IFNs. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA)–
mediated silencing of SOCS1 resulted in strongly enhanced
type I IFN signaling as shown by increased and prolonged
STAT phosphorylation and stronger induction of apoptosis.
Silencing of SOCS1 was associated with down-regulation of
basal Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and up-regulation of basal Bak and
Bax, suggesting that reduced SOCS1 expression might lower
the threshold of susceptibility to type I IFN–mediated
apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of antiapoptotic to
proapoptotic molecules. In summary, our results indicate an
important role of SOCS1 in IFN resistance of neuroendocrine
tumor cells, mediated through negative regulation of type I
IFN–induced Jak/STAT signaling. Knocking down SOCS1 by
siRNA is a promising new approach to enhance the therapeutic potency of type I IFNs in neuroendocrine tumors. [Cancer

Introduction
Neuroendocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic system
are a rare and heterogeneous category of tumors. The majority of
neuroendocrine tumors have already metastasized at the time of
diagnosis, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of less than 50% (1, 2).
IFN-a is used for biotherapy of various tumors, including neuroendocrine tumors (1, 3–5). Although IFN-a generally provides
excellent control of hypersecretion-related symptoms, only 10% of
patients respond with partial tumor remission (3, 4, 6). Compared
with IFN-a, IFN-h has been shown to exhibit more-potent growthinhibitory effects on neuroendocrine BON1 tumor cells in vitro (7).

IFN-a and IFN-h belong to the group of type I IFNs that
comprises three major subtypes (IFN-a, IFN-h, and IFN-N). All
type I IFNs display significant structural homology and bind to the
same receptor complex. The type I IFN receptor consists of two
subunits: IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 (8). Specificity of distinct type I
IFNs is assumed to be mediated by receptor complex formation of
IFNAR-1 and different splice variants of IFNAR-2 (IFNAR-2a,
IFNAR-2b, and IFNAR-2c; refs. 7, 9, 10).
Signaling through type I IFN receptor leads to the activation of
Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and TYK2), which in turn phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
proteins 1 and 2. STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerize and, together
with the accessory factor IFN regulatory factor 9 (p48), form a
transcription factor complex that is known as IFN-stimulated gene
factor 3 (ISGF3). Finally, ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and
activates the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes, the products
of which account for the antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory properties of IFNs (11).
The Jak/STAT signaling cascade is negatively regulated by
suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins (12–14). The
family of SOCS proteins comprises eight members (SOCS1–7 and
CIS), all sharing a central SH2 domain and a COOH-terminal SOCS
box motif (15). As their expression is inducible by a variety of
cytokines through STAT-dependent mechanisms, SOCS proteins
form part of a powerful negative feedback loop of cytokine signaling.
SOCS1 and SOCS3 are the most effective inhibitors of Jak/STAT
signaling (16, 17). They mediate their action by either interacting
with cytokine receptors or directly binding to phosphorylated
tyrosine residues of Jaks (18, 19). Studies with SOCS1- or SOCS3deficient mice indicate that SOCS1 is primarily a negative regulator
of IFN signaling (20, 21), whereas SOCS3 is primarily a negative
regulator of interleukin-6 signaling (22). Increased SOCS1 expression inhibited IFN-mediated antitumor and antiviral effects in a
variety of tumor cell lines and was found to correlate with poor
response to IFN-a in chronic myeloid leukemia and HCV in vivo
(17, 23–27).
Here, we comparatively investigate the effects of SOCS1
overexpression and SOCS1 silencing on type I IFN signaling in
neuroendocrine tumor cells. Our findings indicate that SOCS1 has
a critical role in regulating the extent of type I IFN response and
prove that small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated silencing of
SOCS1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the
antitumor effects of type I IFNs in neuroendocrine tumors.

Cancer Research
BON1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium (Life Technologies/
Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 0.4% amphotericin B (Biochrom)
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stable BON1 clones were established as
described previously (27). Human insulinoma CM cells were kindly
provided by P. Pozzilli (Rome, Italy). CM cells were cultured in RPMI
(PAA) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4%
amphotericin B.
Transfection of siRNA. BON1 and CM cells were transfected with nontargeted b-Gal siRNA (sense sequence, UUAUGCCGAUCGCGUCACAUU)
or SOCS1 siRNA (sense sequence, GCAUCCGCGUGCACUUUCAUU) using
DharmaFECT (Dharmacon) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, cells were seeded in antibiotic-free complete medium and incubated for 24 h before transfection of siRNAs was done. For transfection, 3 AL of DharmaFECT 3 reagent was added to 97 AL Opti-MEM I
(Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min, before 25 AL of 2 Amol/L oligonucleotides and 75 AL Opti-MEM I were added. After 20 min of incubation, the DharmaFECT 3/oligonucleotide mixture was diluted with
serum-free DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium and added to BON1 cells in a final
concentration of 50 nmol/L.
RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA
isolation and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were done
as described previously (28), using following primers for amplification:
human SOCS1 forward and reverse, 5¶-CACGCACTTCCGCACATTC-3¶ and
5¶-AGCAGCTCGAAGAGGCAGTC-3¶, respectively; human glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward and reverse, 5¶-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA-3¶ and 5¶-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT-3¶, respectively.
PCR was done using 2.0 units of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen)
and a final concentration of 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2 under following conditions:
35 cycles of denaturing at 94jC for 30 s, annealing at 58jC for 30 s, and
extension at 72jC for 30 s. Relative expression levels were calculated using
the comparative DDC t method and internal GAPDH for normalization.
Protein extraction and Western blotting. Protein extraction and
Western blotting were done as previously described in detail (27, 29).
Primary antibodies used were pSTAT1, Bid, and Bcl-2 (BD Transduction
Laboratories); pSTAT2 and STAT2 (Upstate Biotechnology); STAT1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); Bcl-xL, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell Signaling); Bax and Bak (UBI); and h-actin
(Sigma).

Assessment of cell viability. BON1 and CM cells were seeded into 96well plates at a density of 2,500 per well and grown for 24 h. Next, the cells
were incubated with various concentrations of IFN-a (10, 100, and 1,000
IU/mL) or IFN-h (1, 5, 50, 100, and 1,000 IU/mL) in complete medium
containing 10% FCS. Metabolic activity was measured with Cell Titer
96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) 6 days after
stimulation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following 3 h of
incubation with Cell Titer 96 solution, absorbance at 492 nm was
determined using an ELISA plate reader.
Quantification of DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analysis. The
rate of apoptotic cell death was quantified by determining DNA
fragmentation according to Nicoletti et al. (30). Briefly, cells were incubated
for 24 h in a hypotonic buffer (1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100,
50 Ag/mL propidium iodide) and analyzed by flow cytometry on a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest software (Becton
Dickinson). Nuclei to the left of the ‘‘G1-peak’’ containing hypodiploid
DNA were considered apoptotic.
Hoechst staining. For morphologic assessment of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 20 min followed by washing with PBS. The fixed cells were
stained with 250 Ag/mL Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h and
subsequently examined by fluorescence microscopy.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using two-tailed
Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
SOCS1 modulates the extent of type I IFN–induced STAT
phosphorylation. To investigate the role of constitutive SOCS1
expression in IFN resistance, we created SOCS1 overexpressing
BON1 cell clones. For further experiments, one pCR3.1/SOCS1
clone was selected based on maximal overexpression as determined by quantitative PCR. Compared with the mock-transfected
control clone (pCR3.1/mock), SOCS1 mRNA expression was
increased f9-fold in the selected pCR3.1/SOCS1 clone (Fig. 1A).
Previous studies reported type I IFNs to induce STAT phosphorylation in several cell lines (31–33). We therefore investigated the
ability of IFN-a and IFN-h to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of

transfected with b-Gal siRNA or SOCS1 siRNA were incubated with indicated concentrations of IFN-a or IFN-h for 15 min, 2 h, or 4 h. Protein expression of
phosphorylated and total STAT1 and STAT2 was evaluated by Western blot analysis. One representative blot of three experiments.

STAT1 and STAT2 in neuroendocrine tumor cells. In pCR3.1/
mock–transfected BON1 cells, treatment with IFN-a or IFN-h dosedependently induced STAT1 and STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation
within 15 min (Fig. 1B). In comparison, IFN-a– and IFN-h–induced
activation of STAT1 and STAT2 was strongly inhibited in pCR3.1/
SOCS1 clones (Fig. 1B).
To investigate the comparative effects of increased and reduced
SOCS1 expression on type I IFN–mediated Jak/STAT signaling, we
identified a siRNA duplex specifically down-regulating SOCS1. The
SOCS1 siRNA duplex was efficiently transfected into BON1 tumor
cells by DharmaFECT 3 (Dharmacon). Additionally, a non-targeted
siRNA (b-Gal) was transfected in each experiment as a control. As
verified by quantitative RT-PCR, basal SOCS1 mRNA expression in
BON1 cells transfected with SOCS1 siRNA was decreased by f80%
compared with BON1 cells transfected with b-Gal siRNA (Fig. 2A).
In addition, we investigated the effects of SOCS1 siRNA transfection on type I IFN–induced SOCS1 mRNA expression. In BON1
cells transfected with b-Gal siRNA, 60 min of incubation with IFN-a
(1,000 IU/mL) and IFN-h (1,000 IU/mL) strongly induced SOCS1

mRNA expression f4- and f14-fold, respectively. In comparison
with the IFN-a– and IFN-h–induced SOCS1 mRNA levels in b-Gal
siRNA-transfected BON1 cells, IFN-a– and IFN-h-induced SOCS1
mRNA levels in SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells were
suppressed by f60% and f80%, respectively (Fig. 2A). In b-Gal
siRNA-transfected BON1 cells, IFN-a (1,000 IU/mL) and IFN-h
(1,000 IU/mL) strongly induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, which decreased quickly and was barely detectable after
4 h (Fig. 2B). In contrast, SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells
showed enhanced and prolonged STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in response to IFN-a and IFN-h, which was still strongly
detectable after 4 h (Fig. 2B).
To confirm the critical role of SOCS1 as cause and target of IFN
resistance in neuroendocrine tumor cells, we extended our
experiments to the human insulinoma cell line CM. CM tumor
cells were efficiently transfected with siRNA using DharmaFECT
2 (Dharmacon). Compared with b-Gal siRNA-transfected CM
cells, basal as well as IFN-a– and IFN-h–induced SOCS1 mRNA
expression levels were significantly decreased by f45%, f70%,

and f85% in SOCS1 siRNA-transfected CM cells (Fig. 3A). Similar
to the results obtained for BON1 cells, down-regulation of SOCS1
potently enhanced and prolonged type I IFN–induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in CM cells (Fig. 3B).
SOCS1 modulates type I IFN–mediated effects on cell
viability. The effects of IFN-a and IFN-h on cell viability of SOCS1
overexpressing and SOCS1-deficient cells were investigated in cell
viability assays. Both type I IFNs significantly decreased the
number of viable pCR3.1/mock–transfected BON1 clones (Fig. 4A).
The antitumor effect of IFN-h was more pronounced than that of
IFN-a as shown by a higher maximal reduction of viable cells after
6 days (4 F 1% and 45 F 7%, respectively; Fig. 4A). However, the
antitumor effects of both type I IFNs were completely abrogated in
pCR3.1/SOCS1–transfected BON1 clones (Fig. 4A).
In marked contrast, siRNA-mediated silencing of SOCS1 potently
enhanced the loss of BON1 cell viability in response to type I IFNs
(Fig. 4B and C). After 6 days of incubation with IFN-a or IFN-h, the
maximal reduction of viable SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells

compared with viable b-Gal siRNA-transfected BON1 cells was
strongly increased for both type I IFNs ( from 16 F 6% to 26 F 5%
and 49 F 8% to 78 F 5%; Fig. 4B). Additionally, down-regulation of
SOCS1 significantly heightened the sensitivity of BON1 cells to very
low concentrations of IFN-h (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4D and E,
similar results were obtained for CM cells, suggesting that SOCS1
inhibition might be a general mechanism to increase type I IFNs’
antitumor effects in neuroendocrine tumor cells.
SOCS1 modulates the extent of type I IFN–induced apoptosis. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the loss of neuroendocrine tumor cell viability, we analyzed whether treatment
with IFN-a or IFN-h results in the induction of apoptosis. As
assessed by flow cytometry, a 72-h exposure of b-Gal siRNAtransfected BON1 cells to 1,000 IU/mL IFN-a or IFN-h increased
the fraction of cells with sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, Hoechst staining showed cell shrinkage and chromatin
condensation (Fig. 5B). Significantly, down-regulation of SOCS1
potently enhanced these hallmarks of apoptosis (Fig. 5A and B).

by Western blot analysis. One representative blot of three experiments.

SOCS1 Silencing Enhances Type I IFN Signaling

Figure 4. SOCS1 modulates type I IFN–mediated effects on cell viability. In all experiments, cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of IFN-a or IFN-h
for 6 d. Cell viability was measured with Cell Titer 96 kit (Promega). Columns, mean of four independently done experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
***, P < 0.001 versus untreated control. +, P < 0.05; +++, P < 0.001 versus the b-Gal siRNA-transfected comparison group. Cell viability is shown for pCR3.1/mock and
pCR3.1/SOCS1 BON1 clones (A ), b-Gal siRNA- and SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells (B and C ), and b-Gal siRNA- and SOCS1 siRNA-transfected CM cells
(D and E).

To elucidate the pathways by which BON1 cells undergo type I
IFN–induced apoptosis, we analyzed caspase activation by
Western blot technique. Treatment with IFN-h slightly induced
cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 as well as cleavage
and inactivation of PARP (Fig. 5C). However, this effect of IFN-h
was markedly enhanced in SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells
(Fig. 5C). As the caspase-8 substrate Bid provides a link between
the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, we monitored
Bid levels after exposure to IFN-a or IFN-h for 24 h. In b-Gal
siRNA-transfected BON1 cells, IFN-h caused a slight decrease in
Bid protein levels, an effect that was strikingly increased in SOCS1
siRNA-transfected BON1 cells (Fig. 5D). Given the importance of
Bcl-2 family members in apoptosis regulation (34, 35), expression
of these proteins was examined after treatment with IFN-a
or IFN-h for 24 h. In b-Gal siRNA-transfected BON1 cells, no
major changes in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels were noted
during treatment with IFN-a and IFN-h, whereas SOCS1 siRNAtransfected BON1 cells exhibited a marked decrease in basal
as well as type I IFN–induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels
(Fig. 5D). Simultaneously, down-regulation of SOCS1 strongly
increased basal as well as type I IFN–induced Bak expression and
also slightly increased basal as well as type I IFN–induced levels of
Bax (Fig. 5D).

Down-regulation of SOCS1 affects cell cycle phase distribution. Type I IFNs have been previously shown to induce S-phase
accumulation in BON1 cells (7). Consistent with these findings,
b-Gal siRNA-transfected BON1 cells responded to both type I IFNs
with a slight accumulation of cells in the S phase, which was
significant only for IFN-h (Fig. 6A). Moreover, treatment with IFN-a
and IFN-h significantly decreased the fraction of cells in G0-G1
phase (Fig. 6A). We next examined whether down-regulation of
SOCS1 affected cell cycle phase distribution. Compared with
untreated b-Gal siRNA-transfected BON1 cells, untreated SOCS1
siRNA-transfected BON1 cells showed a significantly reduced
S-phase fraction as well as a significantly increased G0-G1 phase
fraction (Fig. 6B). This finding indicates that down-regulation of
SOCS1 results in G0-G1 phase accumulation per se. In addition,
treatment of SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells with IFN-h strongly
induced S-phase accumulation, suggesting that SOCS1 inhibition
and type I IFNs might exhibit additive antiproliferative effects by
blocking normal cell cycle progression at two different stages.

Discussion
Type I IFNs inhibit proliferation of various cell types by
transducing regulatory signals through the Jak/STAT pathway.

IFN-a is commonly used for biotherapy of several malignancies,
including neuroendocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic
system. However, its antitumor efficacy is often limited due to IFN
resistance (1, 3–5). Several overexpression studies have shown that
SOCS1 is a critical negative regulator of type I IFN signaling in vitro
(17, 23, 27, 33). Moreover, increased SOCS1 expression was recently
found to correlate with poor antitumor and antiviral response to
IFN-a in vivo (25, 26). However, the consequences of decreased
SOCS1 expression on the effects of exogenously administered type I
IFNs have not been characterized. In the present study, we
therefore targeted SOCS1 by siRNA to enhance the antitumor
effects of type I IFNs on neuroendocrine tumor cells. Transfection
of a single SOCS1 siRNA duplex significantly reduced basal as well
as IFN-a– and IFN-h–induced SOCS1 mRNA expression levels in
BON1 and CM cells. A recent study has shown that bone marrow
macrophages from SOCS1 / mice responded to IFN-a with
prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (21). Consistently,
we showed that type I IFN–induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
STAT1 and STAT2 in cells transfected with SOCS1 siRNA was
markedly increased and prolonged compared with cells transfected

with non-targeted siRNA. As a consequence of enhanced and
prolonged STAT signaling, SOCS1 silencing significantly amplified
the antitumor effects of IFN-a and IFN-h.
The mechanisms by which IFN-a and IFN-h mediate these
antitumor activities are only partially understood but can involve
apoptosis and interference of normal cell cycle progression (36, 37).
In several cancer cell types (including glioma, breast cancer,
hepatoma, and neuroendocrine tumor cells), IFN-h has greater
antitumor effects than IFN-a via the induction of apoptosis (7,
38–40). In agreement with these studies, we found that in BON1
and in CM cells, IFN-h exhibited higher antitumor activity than
IFN-a, which was largely mediated by the induction of apoptosis.
Exposure of b-Gal–transfected BON1 cells to IFN-h induced
modest cleavage of caspase-8, Bid, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP.
Significantly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of SOCS1 strongly
enhanced this proapoptotic response to IFN-h, indicating that
reduced SOCS1 expression facilitates recruitment of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway.
Given the importance of Bcl-2 family members as major
regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (34, 35), we analyzed

expression levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and proapoptotic
Bak/Bax. Compared with b-Gal siRNA-transfected BON1 cells,
SOCS1 siRNA-transfected BON1 cells exhibited a marked decrease
in basal protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Concomitantly, basal
protein levels of Bak and Bax were elevated in SOCS1 siRNAtransfected BON1 cells. These findings suggest that reduced SOCS1
expression might lower the threshold of susceptibility to type I
IFN–mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of antiapoptotic to
proapoptotic molecules.
Despite their proapoptotic properties, type I IFNs can affect all
phases of the cell cycle, most commonly by blocking G1-S
progression (6, 41–43). In neuroendocrine BON1 tumor cells, IFNa and IFN-h have been shown to induce S-phase accumulation (7).
In our study, we found IFN-a and IFN-h to slightly induce S-phase
accumulation and to significantly decrease the fraction of cells in
G0-G1 phase. Compared with untreated BON1 cells transfected with
b-Gal siRNA, untreated BON1 cells transfected with SOCS1 siRNA
showed a significantly reduced S-phase fraction as well as a
significantly increased G0-G1 phase fraction. This finding indicates
that down-regulation of SOCS1 results in G0-G1 phase accumulation per se. Furthermore, treatment of SOCS1 siRNA-transfected
BON1 cells with IFN-h strongly induced S-phase accumulation,
suggesting that SOCS1 inhibition and type I IFNs exhibit additive
antiproliferative effects by blocking normal cell cycle progression at
two different stages.

In summary, this is the first study showing that siRNA-mediated
silencing of SOCS1 strongly enhances the antitumor effects of type
I IFNs in vitro. Furthermore, Shen et al. have recently reported that
siRNA-mediated SOCS1 silencing in murine antigen-presenting
dendritic cells strongly enhanced antigen-specific antitumor
immunity (44). This important finding suggests that systemic
inhibition of SOCS1 might not only enhance the direct antitumor
effects of exogenously administered type I IFN but also the general
antitumor immune response.
Although the efficacy of systemic RNA interference–mediated
silencing of SOCS1 in vivo still has to be proven, several genes
have already been successfully silenced after systemic delivery of
siRNA in mice and non-human primates (45–47) and future use
of this technique in humans seems feasible. Our results indicate
that siRNA-mediated silencing of SOCS1 is a powerful tool to
overcome IFN resistance and might help to considerably
improve the therapy of neuroendocrine tumors and other
malignancies.
