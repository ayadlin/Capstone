Abstract
Hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF1 and HIF2) are heterodimeric transcription factors consisting of α
regulatory subunits and a constitutively expressed β subunit. The expression of α regulatory subunits is promoted by hypoxia, cancer-associated mutations, and inflammatory cytokines. Thus, HIF1 and HIF2 provide a
molecular link between cancer and inflammation. We have recently identified novel small molecules
that selectively inhibit translation of the HIF2a message and thereby powerfully inhibit the expression of
HIF2a target genes. We report here that Connectivity Map analysis links three of these compounds to the
anti-inflammatory cytokine 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2). As with our identified compounds, PGJ2
inhibits translation of the HIF2a message in a mammalian target of rapamycin–independent manner by
promoting the binding of iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) to a noncanonical iron responsive element (IRE)
embedded within the 5′-untranslated region of the HIF2a message. The IRE is necessary and sufficient for
mediating the effect. Mutation of the IRE sequence, or downregulation of IRP1 expression, blocks the effect
of PGJ2 on HIF2a translation. This is the first report of an endogenous natural molecule regulating HIF2a
translation, and it suggests that part of the anti-inflammatory and putative antineoplastic effects of PGJ2
may be mediated through inhibition of HIF2a within tumor epithelial cells themselves and/or mesenchymal
cells of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3071–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is directly linked to cancer
progression, angiogenesis, and inflammation. HIF is critical
for the transcriptional regulation of the cellular response to
hypoxia. In addition to hypoxia, tumor-associated mutations
that activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, inactivate the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, or disrupt the mitochondrial Krebs cycle result in increased HIF activity (1). HIF
is upregulated in the majority of human tumors and it has
been proposed as a prognostic factor for aggressive disease.
Many preclinical models indicate that HIF inactivation may

lead to suppression of tumor growth (2–4) as well as regression of pathologic angiogenesis in nonmalignant diseases
such as macular regeneration (5).
HIF has also been implicated in promoting inflammatory
responses. Targeted deletion of HIF1a from macrophages of
transgenic mice led to significant attenuation of experimentally induced serum sickness or chemically induced dermatitis (6). Recently, HIF1a has been identified as a direct
transcriptional target of NF-κB (7). It is therefore not surprising that HIF has been proposed, and to a great extent validated, as a therapeutic molecular target for antineoplastic
and anti-inflammatory interventions (8).
In an effort to discover HIF-based antineoplastic and antiinflammatory compounds, we conducted a cell-based screen
and discovered four small molecules that decrease HIF2a
expression under conditions of normoxia and hypoxia (9).
Microarray analyses indicated that these small molecules
powerfully inhibited the expression of signature HIF2a target
genes. As part of our studies to understand the mechanism of
action of these inhibitors, we used the Connectivity Map to
identify other small molecules that might mimic the gene expression changes induced by the HIF2a inhibitors. The Connectivity Map is a reference collection of gene expression
profiles from cultured human cell lines (breast cancer epithelial cell line MCF7, prostate cancer cells PC3, nonepithelial
leukemia line HL60, and melanoma cell line SKMEL5) treated

with a large number of diverse bioactive small molecules.
The current collection (build 02) contains data for 6,100
treatment instances representing 1,309 discrete small molecules. Comparative analysis between a “query” gene expression signature (generated by profiling cells treated with small
molecules or corresponding to a physiologic or a disease
specific process) and the Connectivity Map collection may
highlight similar patterns of gene expression changes and
therefore lead to the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes, and diseases. In the case of our HIF2a
inhibitor “query” signatures, the connectivity analysis strongly
linked the activity of three of our four inhibitors to the
endogenous anti-inflammatory 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin
J2 (PGJ2).
In this article, we confirm this linkage experimentally and
we show that PGJ2 inhibits HIF2a translation in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)–independent manner. PGJ2
acts by enhancing the binding of the iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) to the recently identified iron responsive element (IRE) located within the 5′-untranslated region (UTR)
of HIF2a message (9, 10). Mutational analyses and reporter
hybrid experiments indicate that the IRE element is both
necessary and sufficient for the ability of PGJ2 to inhibit
HIF2a translation. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that PGJ2 is a key endogenous negative regulator of
inflammation and angiogenesis (11) and that it constitutes
one of the mechanisms used by cells to resolve the inflammatory response (12–14). We therefore propose that HIF2 is
likely an important target through which PGJ 2 exerts its
anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects, and that this
interaction is one of the endogenous mechanisms by which
cells downregulate HIF2a levels upon restoration of normal
ambient oxygen tension.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids, cell culture conditions, and luciferase assays.
Complete description of plasmids and cell lines used in this
study is provided elsewhere (9). Buffers were made as described in ref. 15, and chemicals ordered from Sigma. Cells
were grown on DMEM-10% Fetal Clone and transfected with
Lipofectamine 2000. Unless stated differently, 25% confluent
cells were treated with either fresh DMEM or DMEM supplemented with DMSO-only or PGJ2 for 24 h and then changed
into fresh DMEM or DMEM supplemented with DMSO-only
or PGJ2 for an additional 24 h, before harvesting at 90% to
100% confluence. For hypoxic experiments, cells were incubated at the indicated oxygen concentration for the latter
24 h. All cell lines used in this work were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection, aliquoted, immediately
frozen, and replated for the purposes of these experiments
within the last 9 mo. Luciferase assays were done using the
Luciferase Assay Reporter System (Promega). Stable clones
were normalized to medium-only–treated wells.
Gene expression and Connectivity Map analysis. Gene
expression profiles of 786-0 cells, treated with small-molecule
inhibitors or vehicle control, were generated using Affymetrix
U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays and compound signatures were

derived as described elsewhere (9). Raw gene expression data
have GEO series accession no. GSE13818. Compound signatures from which non–HG-U133A probe sets were removed
(Supplementary Table S1) were used to query the Connectivity Map (build 02). Details of the Connectivity Map data set
and analytics are provided elsewhere (16).
Western blots. Proteins were immunoblotted as described
before (4). Primary antibodies (1:1,000) include anti-HIF1a
and anti-HIF2a (Novus); anti–Glut-1 (Alpha Diagnostics);
anti-p70S6K, anti–phospho-T389 p70S6K, anti–phospho-S235/6
S6, and anti-RhoB (Cell Signaling Technologies); or anti-actin
(Novus). Gel densitometry was done using SynGene Gene Tools
software package (Synoptics Ltd.).
Cycloheximide experiments. Cycloheximide (10 μg/mL)
was added to DMSO- or PGJ2-treated cells at t = −4, −3, −2,
and −1 h and cells were lysed at t = 0. HIF2a expression was
quantified by Western blot.
Quantitative real-time PCR. The following intron-spanning primers were used (forward and reverse, respectively):
for β 2-microglobulin, 5′-TTTCATCCATCCGACATTGA-3′
and 5′-ATCTTCAAACCTCCATGATG-3′; for HIF2a, 5′-GGATCAGCGCACAGAGTTC-3′ and 5′-GTACTGGGTGGCGTAGCACT-3′; and for EGLN3, 5′-ATCAGCTTCCTCCTGTCCCT-3′
and 5′-GGGCTGCACTTCGTGTGGGT-3′. Nascent HIF2a message
levels were determined using intronic primers 5′-AGACGGTGGACTCCGCCA-3′ and 5′-TTAAAGGGAGGGGTACAC-3′.
In vivo [35S]methionine pulse-label experiments. Cells
were treated with medium only, DMSO, or PGJ2; pulsed with
[35S]methionine (NEN) for 30 min; and chased with 3 mg/mL
methionine for 1.5 and 3 h. Cell lysate (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-HIF2a or control anti-HA Y-11
(Santa Cruz) antibodies.
Other assays. Polysomal profile analysis (17), electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and in vitro iron competition assays (9) were done as described. Prostaglandin
D2-MOX EIA Kit (Cayman Chemical Company) was used
for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) ELISA (18).

Results
Connectivity Map analysis links HIF2a inhibitors to
PGJ2. In previous work, we described how we identified several small-molecule HIF2a inhibitors (9). To gain insight into
the signaling pathways perturbed by these inhibitors, we generated gene expression signatures for these compounds in
the human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell line 786-O and
subjected these signatures to Connectivity Map analysis.
786-O cells are VHL-deficient cells and therefore constitutively expressed HIF2a. Comparison of gene expression
changes induced by the small-molecule HIF2a inhibitors to
the profiles included in the Connectivity Map database strongly suggested that three of four compounds (40, 41, and 76)
shared a functional similarity with the anti-inflammatory
PGJ2 (Fig. 1A).
PGJ 2 decreases HIF2a activity in a dose-dependent
manner. To validate the Connectivity Map–derived prediction that PGJ2 is involved in HIF signaling, we treated 786-O–
derived, hypoxia response element (HRE)-luciferase–expressing

IRP1-Mediated Inhibition of HIF2a Translation by PGJ2

Figure 1. The Connectivity Map links inhibition of HIF activity to PGJ2. A, connectivity mapping of small-molecule HIF2a inhibitors. The “barview” is
constructed from 6,100 horizontal lines, each representing an individual treatment instance, ordered by their corresponding connectivity scores with
signatures produced from compounds 40, 41, 76, and 77, as indicated (+1, top; −1, bottom). All PGJ2 instances in the data set (n = 15) are colored in black
bars (left). Colors applied to the remaining instances (i.e., gene expression profiles of the cells obtained with other than PGJ2 compounds) reflect the sign of
their scores (green, positive; gray, null; red, negative). The rank, name of the perturbagen [instance id], concentration, cell line, and connectivity score
for each PGJ2 instance are also shown (right). Permutation P values for the set of all PGJ2 instances are <0.00001 for compounds 40, 41, and 76, and
0.01374 for compound 77. B, effect of PGJ2 on HRE-luciferase reporter activity. Stable 786-O cells harboring a HRE-driven luciferase reporter plasmid
(7H4, white columns) or a hypoxia-independent, SV40-driven luciferase reporter plasmid (7SV, gray columns) were treated with PGJ2, DMSO as diluent control
(D), or medium only (M). Relative luciferase activity was normalized to that of medium-only–treated cells, which was set to 1. C, effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a protein
expression and HIF2a target gene expression. 786-O cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PGJ2 as described in Materials and Methods.
HIF2a and Glut-1 expression was analyzed by Western blot. β-Actin is shown as loading control (top). EGLN3 expression was measured by quantitative
RT-PCR, normalized to β2-microglobulin (bottom). D, PGJ2 does not affect HIF2a mRNA expression. Quantitative RT-PCR was done using RNA extracted
from 786-O cells treated in parallel with PGJ2. Data show relative expression of HIF2a message, normalized to β2-microglobulin. Bars, SEM (B–D).

(7H4) and SV40-luciferase–expressing (7SV) control cells with
increasing doses of PGJ2. Fresh medium containing the indicated concentrations of PGJ2 or vehicle-only DMSO control
was applied to cells at 24-hour intervals. Luciferase activity
was measured at 48 hours. PGJ2 decreased HRE-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 1B) in a dose-dependent manner, with an
IC50app of 5 μmol/L, whereas SV40-driven luciferase activity
was not affected. This action of PGJ2 seems to be independent
of NF-κB activation. Application of the IκB kinase inhibitor

cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Moreover, this seems
also to be a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ
(PPAR-γ)–independent function of PGJ2; the PGJ2/HIF inhibitor
linkage holds strong even in Connectivity Map comparisons using expression profiles obtained from PPAR-γ–negative cells
(MCF7), and application of a PPAR-γ inhibitor, GW9662, did
not block the effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a activity (data not shown).
This decrease in HRE-mediated luciferase activity closely
matched the decrease in HIF2a protein expression as well as
that of the HIF2a target genes Glut-1 (as measured by Western

effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a protein expression is due to decreased
transcription of the HIF2a gene, we performed quantitative RTPCR to examine HIF2a mRNA expression in PGJ2- or vehicleonly DMSO–treated 786-O cells. We observed no concomitant
decrease in HIF2a mRNA expression, indicating that the transcription of HIF2a mRNA was not affected (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether PGJ2 alters the stability of HIF2a protein, we

3074

examined the half-life of HIF2a in PGJ 2 - or vehicle-only

HIF2a protein half-life (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
The effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a expression and activity is not a
cell line–specific phenomenon; treatment of several VHLdeficient human RCC lines with PGJ2 similarly resulted in decreased HIF2a protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A).

IRE sequence seems to be nonfunctional (9), at least in the cell
lines tested, we see no decrease in HIF1a expression in
UMRC2 cells treated with PGJ2 (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
PGJ2 inhibits HIF translation in a mTOR-independent
manner. To determine if PGJ2 decreases translation of the
HIF2a message, we evaluated the synthesis rate and stability
of the newly synthesized HIF2a by an [35S]methionine pulsechase experiment on PGJ2- or vehicle-only DMSO–treated
786-O cells. PGJ2 was found to significantly decrease the
amount of protein translated from the mRNA without decreasing the half-life of the protein (Fig. 2A, top). Loading
control is 1/1,000th of the cell lysate used in the respective
immunoprecipitation directly loaded into an SDS-PAGE gel.
This loading control shows not only that equal protein was
used in each immunoprecipitation but also that PGJ2 does
not globally decrease cellular translation (Fig. 2A, bottom).
Consistent with the interpretation that PGJ2 does not affect
global translation, polysome analysis was done on vehicleonly DMSO–, rapamycin-, or PGJ2-treated 786-O cells. These
experiments show that PGJ2 had little effect on the number

of ribosomes actively engaged in translation, whereas rapamycin attenuated it. However, PGJ2, like rapamycin, seemed
to slightly decrease the monosome fraction (Fig. 2B).
It has been shown before that mTOR inhibits HIF translation as part of a global effect on translation (9, 19–21). We
therefore examined whether the effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a
translation could be attributed to inhibition of mTOR activity. 786-O cells were treated with medium only, DMSO (vehicle only), rapamycin, or PGJ 2 and the effect of these
treatments on mTOR activity was monitored by detecting
phospho-S6, p70S6K, and phospho-p70S6K levels, as measured by Western blot using total or phospho-specific antibodies. HIF2a protein expression and HRE activity were
decreased by both PGJ2 and rapamycin. However, only rapamycin decreased phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR
targets p70S6K and rpS6 (Fig. 2C).
The 5′-UTR of HIF2a mRNA is necessary and sufficient
for the inhibitory effect of PGJ 2 . Because PGJ 2 inhibits
translation of the HIF2a message in a mTOR-independent
manner, we next examined whether the 5′-UTR of the HIF2a

the 5′-UTR HIF2a IRE. Polyclonal
786-O cells stably expressing a

were treated with PGJ2. Mutants are

spanning the corresponding UTR

activity is reported as a ratio of

B, inhibition of IRP1 is sufficient to
block the effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a
activity. 786-O cells were infected
with shRNA targeting solely IRP1
(shIRP1) or IRP2 (shIRP2) or with
shRNAs targeting both IRP paralogs
(shIRP1/2). Downregulation of IRP1
and/or IRP2 was confirmed with
quantitative RT-PCR and with
Western blot (data not shown). These
cells were treated with PGJ2, and
EGLN3 mRNA expression was
measured by quantitative RT-PCR,
normalized to β2-microglobulin.
All measurements were done in

message might be involved in mediating its effect. We therefore generated two luciferase reporter constructs, the first
driven by the endogenous HIF2a promoter alone (HIF) and
the second by the HIF2a promoter containing the 5′-UTR
(HIF-UTR). These constructs were stably transfected into
786-O cells. Treatment with PGJ2 decreased the luciferase activity derived from the UTR-containing plasmid but not that
from the plasmid driven by the HIF promoter alone. Moreover, this effect was equal in magnitude to the effect on
HRE-driven reporter activity. The ratio of normalized HREluciferase over SV40-luciferase reporter activities is shown
compared with the ratio of normalized HIF-UTR-luciferase
over HIF-luciferase activities in vehicle-only DMSO– versus
PGJ2-treated cells (Fig. 2D, top). These experiments indicate
that HIF2a 5′-UTR is necessary for the inhibitory effect of PGJ2
on HIF2a translation and corroborate the quantitative RT-PCR
findings that the effect of PGJ2 on HIF is not transcriptional.
We next wanted to test if the HIF2a 5′-UTR is sufficient for
conferring sensitivity to PGJ2. To test this, we generated a lu-

3076

ciferase reporter construct (SV-UTR) in which the entire 488bp HIF2a 5′-UTR was cloned between the SV40 promoter
and the luciferase gene of the same SV40-luciferase reporter
(SV) used as a HIF/hypoxia-independent control in the previously discussed experiments. We compared this set of luciferase reporters to a second matched set consisting of a
cytomegalovirus (CMV)- luciferase reporter alone and the
same CMV-luciferase into which a synthetic stem loop was
cloned between the CMV promoter and the start of the luciferase gene (CMV-SL; kind gifts of Michele Pagano, Department of Pathology and NYU Cancer Institute, New York
University School of Medicine, New York, NY). This luciferase
reporter set serves as a random 5′-UTR control that might capture possible effects on RNA helicase activity (22). Shown are
the ratios of normalized CMV-SL over CMV and SV-UTR over
SV luciferase reporter activities from vehicle-only DMSO–
versus PGJ2-treated cells. The results indicate that the effect
of PGJ2 that is mediated through the HIF2a 5′-UTR element
is indeed heterologously transferable to a different promoter

element, whereas PGJ2 had no effect on the synthetic 5′-UTR
element (Fig. 2D, bottom).
The IRE within the HIF2a 5′-UTR is responsible for the
effect of PGJ2 on HIF translation. To map the domain responsible for mediating the effect of PGJ2 on translation of
the HIF2a message, we created several reporter constructs
in which different segments of the HIF2a 5′-UTR were cloned
between the HIF2a promoter and the start of the luciferase
gene and used these constructs to generate stable 786O–derived cell lines. These lines were then treated with
vehicle-only DMSO or PGJ 2. We found that the effect of
PGJ2 maps to a 50-bp segment of the 5′-UTR that contains
a recently reported IRE (9). A mutation in the IRE consensus
loop completely abolished PGJ2 sensitivity. These results
are summarized in Fig. 3A, where the normalized ratio of
uciferase activities from PGJ2- over vehicle-only DMSO–
treated cells is shown.
IRP1 is necessary for the effect of PGJ2 on HIF2a. The
IREs are the mRNA target sequences for the binding of iron
regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2 (23). Nevertheless, slight
variations in the IRE sequences can result in higher affinity
for one of the two proteins (24). We showed before that it is
mainly IRP1 and not IRP2 that can measurably bind to the
HIF2a IRE element, under normoxic conditions, when expressed in endogenous levels (9). We therefore examined
whether IRP1 and/or IRP2 is required for the effect of PGJ2

on HIF2a by assessing the expression of the HIF2a target
gene EGLN3 in 786-O–derived lines infected with shRNAs
targeting IRP1, IRP2, or both IRP1 and IRP2 concomitantly
(Fig. 3B). In keeping with our previous observation that
HIF2a IRE translation is primarily repressed through IRP1,
knocking down the expression of IRP1 resulted in increased
activity of HIF2a, consistent with the observation that IRP1
represses HIF2a translation (Fig. 3B). More importantly,
downregulation of IRP1 abolished the ability of PGJ2 to repress HIF2a activity, whereas inactivation of IRP2 did not
(Fig. 3B). These findings are consistent with the model by
which PGJ2 represses HIF2a translation by enhancing endogenous IRP1 mRNA binding activity.
PGJ2 directly enhances the binding of IRP1 to the HIF2a
IRE. We therefore next sought to determine if PGJ2 affects
the expression of IRP1 and/or IRP2, and we found that, as
is the case for the three small-molecule HIF inhibitors that
linked to PGJ2 in the Connectivity Map, IRP1 expression is
not affected by PGJ2 treatment whereas IRP2 expression is
minimally increased (data not shown). However, IRP2 contributes very little, if at all, to the total IRP bound to the HIF2a
IRE (9). We therefore hypothesized that the effect of PGJ2 on
HIF2a IRE is due to the enhanced binding of IRP1.
To examine this latter possibility, we performed an EMSA

We found that pretreatment of cells with PGJ2 increased the
specific IRE binding activity of cell lysates under normoxic
conditions. This shifted band can be supershifted with IRP1,
but not IRP2, antibodies (data not shown). The effect of PGJ2
on IRP1 binding to the HIF2a IRE probe under 1% oxygen was
very subtle but seemed to be consistently present. Given the
scant effect of PGJ2 on enhancing IRP1 binding in hypoxia,
as measured by EMSA, we decided to further examine the ability of PGJ2 to decrease HIF2a activity at various concentrations
of ambient oxygen that correspond to physiologic or extreme
conditions of tissue oxygenation. The results indicate that
PGJ2 clearly has the ability to repress HIF2a activity at a wide
range of oxygen concentrations spanning the range of physiologic tissue oxygenation (Fig. 4B). Rapamycin, which decreases
HIF2a activity and expression (Fig. 5A and B), does not affect
IRP1 binding to the HIF2a IRE (Fig. 5C). Instead, it decreases
HIF2a transcription (Fig. 5D), as reported before (25).

Discussion
Connectivity mapping linked the gene expression signature of small-molecule HIF2a inhibitors to the molecular
signature of PGJ2. Here we experimentally validate this hypothesis and we show that this function of PGJ2 is mediated
through enhanced IRP1 binding to the HIF2a IRE. This is the
first report of an endogenous cellular metabolite that regulates HIF2a translation through the IRE mechanism.
Activation of the arachidonic acid cascade generates prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) through the activity of cyclooxygenase
synthases. PGH2 can be further metabolized to prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) or PGD2 through corresponding synthases. PGJ2 is
a nonenzymatic degradation product of PGD2. PGE2, in contrast to PGJ 2 , has the ability to promote HIF1a activity
(26, 27) through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor/Src/extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling
pathways (28, 29). In addition, PGE2 promotes colonic adenomatous polyposis through PPAR-δ activation (30, 31). It
therefore seems that PGE2 promotes the “proinflammatory”
and “pro-proliferative” effects of the arachidonic acid cascade. In contrast, PGJ2 inhibits HIF2a translation and activity.
Although PGJ2 has recently been reported to stabilize HIF1a
through inhibition of a lysosomal degradation pathway (32),
we see no such effect in PGJ2-treated UMRC2 cells. It seems
that PGJ2 may “oppose” the effects of PGE2 and therefore
may be a key determinant of the final outcome of arachidonic
acid signaling.
One possibility to explain the link between HIF2a inhibitors and PGJ2 is that the former increase the endogenous expression of PGJ2, a nonenzymatic degradation product of
PGD2. The latter is made from PGH2 by lipocalin or hematopoietic PGD2 synthases. Neither the addition of the cyclooxygenase-1/2 inhibitors indomethacin and sulindac nor
the hematopoietic PGD 2 synthase inhibitor HQL-79 had
any effect on the activity of the compounds (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Similarly, these pharmacologic manipulations had
no effect on baseline HIF2a expression in 786-O cells (data
not shown). We were unable to detect PGD2 in compoundtreated 786-O cell supernatants directly, using a commercially

3078

available ELISA kit (data not shown). However, we found that
PGJ2 and all compounds increased the expression of RhoB, an
endogenous PPAR-γ target gene (Supplementary Fig. S4B and
C; ref. 33). Taken together, these data suggest, but clearly do
not prove, that the compounds may serve, directly or indirectly, as PGJ2 mimetics. Future experiments, involving direct
measurement of PGD2 and PGJ2 by mass spectrometry as well
as cells generated from PGD2 synthase–knockout mice, should
answer definitely the relation between HIF2a inhibitors and
endogenous PGJ2.
An analysis of the Oncomine database shows that the expression of IRP1 and lipocalin-type PGD2 synthase is downregulated in kidney cancer. Specifically, 3 of 17 analyses (2 of
7 data sets) showed decreased IRP1 expression in tumor
versus normal with a P value of <0.0001. Similarly, 3 of 14
analyses (2 of 6 data sets) showed decreased lipocalin PGDS
expression, also with a P value of <0.0001. These data suggest
that there may be selective pressure in RCC to reduce the
activity of IRP1. Of relevant interest also is the observation
that constitutional deletion of hematopoietic PGD synthase
promotes colonic polyposis in APC+/− mice (34).
PGJ2 has been reported to inhibit global translation of
cellular proteins through binding to and inactivation of
eIF4A and sequestration of TRAF2 into stress granules (35).
In our work, we used lower concentrations of PGJ2 that did not
affect global translation. It is likely that the first response of
cells to moderate levels of PGJ2 concentrations is to selectively
downregulate HIF2a translation, whereas higher doses may be
associated with a global reduction of protein translation.
Upregulation of IRP1 binding activity by PGJ2 is likely to
promote iron uptake and availability in sites of inflammation.
Iron is essential for the oxidative burst of polymorphonuclear
cells and macrophages and is therefore important for the
maintenance of local inflammatory and immune responses
(36, 37). The availability of PGJ2 may be a mechanism by
which the end of inflammatory phase (by inhibiting translation of the HIF2a message) is linked to restoration of iron
stores in resident inflammatory and immune cells.
In cells, the majority of IRP1 functions as a cytosolic aconitase. Reduction of cellular iron stores causes a conformational change in the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) of IRP1 protein
that concomitantly decreases its aconitase activity and promotes its binding to IREs (38). Our data indicate that changes
in the intracellular levels of PGJ2 promote the RNA binding activity of IRP1. The exact mechanism by which PGJ2 signals to
IRP1 will be the object of further studies. Currently, we have
shown that PGJ2 does not act as an iron chelator, and therefore
it is likely to affect IRP1 through a novel, ISC-dependent or
ISC-independent mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In summary, we provide evidence for a novel connection
between cancer and inflammation in which programs involved in the resolution of inflammation may modify tumor
vascularization. This connection may contribute to new
strategies of cancer chemoprevention.
