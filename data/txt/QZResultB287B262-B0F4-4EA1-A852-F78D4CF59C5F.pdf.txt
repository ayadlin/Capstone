ABSTRACT
Mutant p53 proteins (mutant p53s) have oncogenic gain-of-function properties
correlated with tumor grade, castration resistance, and prostate cancer (PCa) tumor
recurrence. Docetaxel is a standard first-line treatment for metastatic castrationresistant PCa (mCRPC) after the failure of hormone therapy. However, most mCRPC
patients who receive docetaxel experience only transient benefits and rapidly develop
incurable drug resistance, which is closely correlated with the p53 mutation status.
Mutant p53s were recently reported to regulate the metabolic pathways via sterol
regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Therefore, targeting the SREBP
metabolic pathways with docetaxel as a combination therapy may offer a potential
strategy to improve anti-tumor efficacy and delay cellular drug resistance in mCRPC
harboring mutant p53s. Our previous data showed that fatostatin, a new SREBP
inhibitor, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in androgen receptor (AR)positive PCa cell lines and xenograft mouse models. In this study, we demonstrated
that mutant p53s activate the SREBP-mediated metabolic pathways in metastatic ARnegative PCa cells carrying mutant p53s. By blocking the SREBP pathways, fatostatin
inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in metastatic AR-negative PCa cells
harboring mutant p53s. Furthermore, the combination of fatostatin and docetaxel
resulted in greater proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction compared with
single agent treatment in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, especially those with mutant
p53s. These data suggest for the first time that fatostatin alone or in combination
with docetaxel could be exploited as a novel and promising therapy for metastatic
PCa harboring p53 mutations.

make mutant p53 an extremely attractive target for PCa
therapy.
Docetaxel is a taxane agent that has been widely
used as the front-line treatment for metastatic castrationresistant PCa (mCRPC) after the failure of androgen
deprivation therapy [7]. However, most mCRPC patients
who receive docetaxel experience only transient benefit
and rapidly develop incurable drug resistance. Recent
evidence demonstrated that mutant p53 plays a critical
role in the development of docetaxel resistance in PCa
patients [8]. There is a compelling need to discover new
approaches targeting mutant p53s to treat lethal PCa
progression.

INTRODUCTION
The tumor suppressor TP53 gene, which resides
on chromosome 17p13.1 and encodes the p53 protein, is
one of the most frequent targets for mutation in human
cancers [1, 2]. Mutant p53 proteins (mutant p53s) are
incapable of recognizing wild-type p53 (wtp53) DNA
binding sites. Some mutations acquire new and distinct
oncogenic properties, which are generally referred to as
“gain of function” (GOF) effects [3]. TP53 mutations
have been reported in 3%–20% of prostate cancers (PCa)
[4–6], and are often correlated with tumor grade, castration
resistance, and tumor recurrence [5, 6]. These properties

Mutant p53s were recently reported to regulate
metabolic pathways via regulation of transcription factors,
sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs),
in breast cancer [9, 10]. SREBPs are basic helix-loophelix leucine (bHLH) zipper transcription factors that
transcriptionally activate genes involved in fatty acid
and cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis [11, 12].
Previous studies revealed that SREBPs were highly
elevated in PCa specimens with aggressive pathologic
features and also promoted PCa cell growth and lethal
progression [13, 14]. Targeting the SREBP metabolic
pathways in a docetaxel-based combination therapy may
offer a potential strategy to improve anti-tumor efficacy
and overcome cellular drug resistance for the treatment of
mCRPC harboring mutant p53s.
SREBPs are the potential targets for the treatment of
androgen receptor (AR)-positive PCa [15, 16]. However,
the role of SREBPs in AR-negative PCa and PCa with p53
mutations has been unexplored. In this study, we revealed
for the first time that mutant p53s activate the SREBPmediated metabolic pathways in AR-negative PCa cells.
Furthermore, treatment with a SREBP inhibitor, fatostatin
[16–18], inhibited cell growth and induced caspasedependent apoptosis in metastatic AR-negative PCa cells,
especially those harboring mutant p53s. In addition, in
vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the combination
of fatostatin and docetaxel resulted in greater anti-tumor
activity compared to single agent in PCa harboring

mutant p53s. These data suggest that fatostatin alone or in
combination with docetaxel could be exploited as a novel
and promising therapy for aggressive PCa bearing p53
mutations.

RESULTS
Mutant p53 proteins activate the SREBPmediated signaling pathways in metastatic
PCa cells
To investigate the frequency of p53 mutations
in PCa, we analyzed the codon distribution of p53
mutations using the IARC TP53 Mutation Database (R17,
November 2013). TP53 mutations in PCa typically occur
within the DNA-binding domain (amino acid 102–292)
with hot spots at codons R175, G245, R248 and R273
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Mutations are subdivided
into “contact mutations” that eliminate an essential
DNA contact (e.g., R273H and R248W) or “structural
mutations” that result in structural perturbations (R175H,
V143A, G245S, Y220C, R249S, and R282W) [19, 20].
To further study the functional impact of TP53 mutations
on the SREBP-mediated metabolic pathways, we selected
human metastatic PCa cell lines with various TP53 status,
such as PC-3 (p53-null) and DU145 (heterozygous p53,
P223L and V274F), as cell models. First, we established

stable PC-3 cell clones expressing various mutant p53s,
including V143A, R248W, R175H or R273H. PC-3 cells
transfected with an empty vector (EV) were developed
as a control (Figure 1A). Overexpression of mutant p53s
showed no effects on cell growth in PC-3 cells. Only
R248W mutation significantly increased cell growth
compared with control cells after 6-day incubation
(Supplementary Figure 1B).
It has been reported that mutant p53s are recruited
to the promoters of genes encoding mevalonate pathway
enzymes via SREBP proteins [9]. This is consistent with
our observation that expression of SREBP-1, SREBP-2
and their downstream target proteins, including fatty acid
synthase (FASN) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR),
was increased in mutant p53s overexpressing PC-3 cells
(Figure 1A). Next, we evaluated whether the lack of p53
expression causes inhibition of the SREBP-mediated
pathways in metastatic PCa cells. Lentivirus-mediated
p53 short hairpin RNA (shp53) interference was used
to knock down endogenous expression of mutant p53s
in DU145 cells. Suppression of endogenous mutant
p53s expression resulted in a significant decrease of
SREBP-2 and HMGCR expression, with slight decreases
of SREBP-1 and FASN expression at the mRNA and
protein levels in DU145 cells (Figure 1B). Moreover,
downregulation of mutant p53s led to reduced cell growth
and colony formation compared with controls (shCon)
in DU145 cells (Supplementary Figure 1C). In addition,
transient expression of wild-type p53 (wtp53) in PC-3
cells was sufficient to down-regulate the expression of
SREBPs and their target genes (Figure 1C). Collectively,
our data suggest that mutant p53s significantly activate
the SREBP-mediated metabolic pathways in metastatic
PCa cells.

PCa cells. However, the effect of fatostatin on metastatic
PCa cells harboring null or mutant p53s is unknown.
Established PCa cell clones with different p53 status
were treated with various concentrations of fatostatin
for 72 hours and cell viability was determined. The half
maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of fatostatin
in different PC-3 cell clones ranged from 6–20 μM
(Figure 2A, left panel and Supplementary Figure 2A).
Of note, fatostatin effectively inhibited the growth of
PC-3 R248W (IC50 = 6.5 μM), which exhibited higher
mutant p53-activated SREBP signaling compared with
other cell clones, suggesting that PC-3 R248W cells
were more sensitive to fatostatin. For DU145 cells
carrying endogenous mutant p53s, the concentration of
fatostatin that inhibited 50% of cell proliferation was
9.5 μM, suggesting that the sensitivity of p53 mutant
cells to fatostatin was higher than that of null p53 cells
(PC-3 parental cells, IC50 = 15.8 μM; and PC-3 EV cells,
IC50 = 16.0 μM). However, the IC50 value of fatostatin in
p53-silenced DU145 cells was 2-fold higher than that in
the control cell clone (shCon) (Figure 2A, right panel).
These data suggest that p53 mutation was a determinant
of fatostatin sensitivity in PCa cells.
Based on the prevalence of contact mutation and the
sensitivity to fatostatin, PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells
harboring mutant p53s were excellent cell models for
subsequent experiments. We next determined the effects of
fatostatin on cell growth and colony formation in PC-3 EV,
PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells. Fatostatin led to reduction
in cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner in
these PCa cell clones (Figure 2B). Notably, significant
inhibition of PC-3 R248W and DU145 cell growth by
fatostatin at 5.0 μM occurred early (day 2), indicating
that fatostatin showed stronger anti-growth effect on p53
mutant cells than p53 null cells. In addition, fatostatin
inhibited the number and size of colony development
in a dose-dependent manner in PC-3 EV, PC-3 R248W
and DU145 cells (Figure 2C). We also observed that a
lower concentration of fatostatin (2.5 μM) displayed
significant inhibition on the number of colony formation
in PC-3 R248W cells. Collectively, these data suggest that
fatostatin suppresses cell proliferation and clonogenicity
in PCa cells, especially those carrying mutant p53s.

Fatostatin inhibits cell proliferation and colony
formation in PCa cells harboring different
p53 status
Mutant p53 proteins gain oncogenic properties that
enable them to promote cancer cell invasion, metastasis
and survival, making them extremely attractive targets
for PCa treatment [21]. Current strategies have focused
on destabilization or inactivation of mutant p53s [22],
reactivation of wild-type function in the mutant p53
protein [23] or targeting the downstream pathways
mediated by mutant p53s such as transforming growth
factor (TGF-β) receptor, epithelial growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and MET (the receptor for hepatocyte growth
factor, HGF) [24–26]. Fatostatin was recently developed
and identified as a SREBP inhibitor that perturbs the
nuclear translocation of SREBPs and inhibits their
transcriptional activity. Our previous study showed that
fatostatin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis
by blocking the SREBP-regulated metabolic pathways
and androgen receptor (AR) signaling in AR-positive

Given the growth inhibitory effect of fatostatin in
PCa cells, we next investigated the potential mechanisms
underlying this inhibition. To determine the impact of
fatostatin on cell cycle distribution, PC-3 EV, PC-3
R248W and DU145 cells were treated with fatostatin for
48 hours, stained with propidium iodide (PI) and then
analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3A,
treatment with fatostatin resulted in an increase of the

effects of fatostatin on G2/M cell cycle-related proteins,

including Cyclin B1, Cdk1 and p-Cdk1 (Tyr15). Western
blot results demonstrated that fatostatin inhibited
expression of Cyclin B1 and p-Cdk1 in a dose-dependent
pattern in PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells (Figure 3B).

To explore whether fatostatin induced apoptosis, flow
cytometry-based Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, caspase
enzymatic activity assay and Western blot analysis of
apoptosis-related proteins were performed. Annexin
V-FITC/PI results showed that fatostatin induced only
slight apoptotic cell death at 20 μM in PC-3 EV cells after
72-hour treatment (Figure 3C, left panel), while PC-3
R248W and DU145 cells treated with fatostatin underwent
a large increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure
3C, middle and right panels). Subsequently, caspase-3/7
activity was examined in PC-3 EV, PC-3 R248W and
DU145 cells after fatostatin treatment for 48 hours. As
shown in Figure 3D, fatostatin at higher concentrations
(10 and 20 μM) significantly increased caspase-3/7 activity
in PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells but not in PC-3 EV cells.
Similar results were demonstrated by Western blot, where
fatostatin led to increases of the cleavage of caspase-9,
caspase-3 and PARP in both PC-3 R248W and DU145
cells (Figure 3E). Taken together, the results of cell cycle
and apoptosis studies indicate that fatostatin causes G2/M
cell cycle arrest and induces caspase-dependent apoptotic
death in PCa cells carrying mutant p53s.

Fatostatin did not affect mRNA expression of these target
genes in PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells (Supplementary
Figure 3A). Western blot analysis also showed that
fatostatin had no effect on p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in PC-3
R248W and DU145 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B). Our
data suggest that fatostatin did not restore wtp53 activity
in PCa cells carrying mutant p53s. Taken together, these
results indicate that fatostatin predominantly inhibited the
SREBP metabolic pathways mediated by mutant p53s in
PCa cells with p53 mutations.

Fatostatin synergizes with docetaxel to inhibit
cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in PCa
cells harboring mutant p53s
Docetaxel is the first-line chemotherapy to improve
survival in mCRPC patients after the failure of hormone
therapy [7]. However, the resistance to docetaxel rapidly
develops and is closely associated with p53 mutation
status [8]. As shown in Supplementary Figure 4A, the IC50
value of docetaxel in PC-3 R248W cells was 217.9 nM,
which was higher than that in PC-3 EV cells (24.8 nM),
suggesting that mutant p53 could be a crucial determinant
for docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Moreover, docetaxel
treatment led to the activation of SREBP expression in
DU145 cells (Supplementary Figure 4B). Therefore,
we hypothesize that docetaxel-based combination
therapy targeting SREBP-mediated pathways may delay
the onset of docetaxel resistance and provide a new
potential strategy for the treatment of mCRPC harboring
mutant p53s.
To test this idea, we first investigated the effect of
fatostatin in combination with docetaxel on the growth
of PC-3 EV, PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells. Cells were
treated with sequential doses of fatostatin and docetaxel,
alone or in combination, for 72 hours and the combination
index (CI) values were subsequently calculated using
the Calcusyn software [31]. As shown in Figure 5A,
the combination of fatostatin with docetaxel exhibited
significant synergistic inhibitory effects on the growth of
these cells. The CI analysis showed statistically significant
synergy with Log (CI) <0, especially in PC-3 R248W cells
(Supplementary Figure 4C). To further investigate the
combinational effect of these two drugs, cells were treated
with fatostatin and docetaxel alone or in combination and
cell growth was determined. As shown in Supplementary
Figure 4D, the combination treatment was more effective
in inhibiting cell growth than single agent treatment. In
concordance with growth inhibition, the combination
treatment displayed significantly reduced clonogenic
capacity of the tested cell lines compared with single agent
treatment at a low concentration of fatostatin (2.5  μM)
or docetaxel (5.0 nM) (Figure 5B and Supplementary
Figure 4E). These data suggest that the combination of
fatostatin and docetaxel resulted in significant inhibition of

Fatostatin significantly suppresses mutant
p53-activated SREBP metabolic pathways
in PCa cells
To reveal the molecular mechanism underlying
the inhibitory effect of fatostatin in PCa cells harboring
mutant p53s, we first examined the transcriptional
expression of SREBPs and their anabolic genes [16]
affected by fatostatin: ATP citrate lyase (ACL), FASN and
stearoyl-CoA desaturade-1 (SCD-1) for lipogenesis; and
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1),
HMGCR, mevalonate kinase (MVK), mevalonate
5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MVD) and low-density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for cholesterogenesis; and
two chaperones, insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) and
SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) in PC-3 EV,
PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells. Fatostatin significantly
down-regulated mRNA expression of these genes in all
tested cells, with more effective reduction detected in
PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells carrying mutant p53s,
(Figure 4A). Similar results were observed by Western blot
analysis, where fatostatin reduced expression of SREBP-1,
SREBP-2 and FASN proteins (Figure 4B). These results
indicate that fatostatin predominantly inhibited the SREBP
metabolic pathways in PCa cells harboring mutant p53s.
Reactivation of wild-type function in mutant p53
protein has been a major strategy for treating human cancer
harboring mutant p53s such as small molecules, STIMA-1
[27] and APR-246 [28]. To determine the restoration of
wtp53 by fatostatin, we performed qPCR analysis of
wtp53 target genes [29, 30], including p21, p53R2,
BAX and MDM2 in PC-3 R248W and DU145 cells.

with null and/or mutant p53s.
Given the synergistic growth inhibitory effect of
fatostatin and docetaxel, we next determined the impact of
the combination on apoptosis. PC-3 EV, PC-3 R248W and
DU145 cells were treated with fatostatin and/or docetaxel
for 72 hours and subjected to caspase-3/7 activity analysis.
Treatment with fatostatin alone at the concentration of
2.5  μM resulted in an increase of caspase-3/7 activity
in PC-3 R248W cells compared with vehicle treatment,
which was not observed in PC-3 EV and DU145 cells.
However, a significant increase of caspase-3/7 activity was
observed in all cell lines in the presence of both fatostatin
and docetaxel (Figure 5C). Additionally, Western blot
analysis demonstrated that the combination of fatostatin
and docetaxel significantly increased expression of
cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP proteins in PC-3
R248W and DU145 cells, but resulted in a small increase
of cleaved PARP in PC-3 EV cells compared with
fatostain or docetaxel alone, respectively (Figure 5D).
Collectively, these data suggest that the combination of
fatostatin and docetaxel has significant synergistic effects
on the induction of apoptosis in PCa cells, especially those
with mutant p53s.

the therapeutic potential of fatostatin and/or docetaxel in
immunodeficient mice. The in vivo results showed that
fatostatin effectively reduced tumor size (Figure 6A,
right panel) and tumor weight (Figure 6B, right panel)
of DU145 xenografts compared to an untreated control
group, whereas fatostatin alone did not significantly
affect the growth of PC-3 xenograft tumors (Figures 6A
and 6B, left panel). The combination of fatostatin and
docetaxel exhibited greater inhibitory effect on both PC-3
and DU145 xenograft models without showing significant
toxicity (body weight) compared to individual drugs
(Figures 6A and 6B; Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B).
In addition, the expression of proliferation (Ki67) and
apoptosis (cPARP) markers in PC-3 and DU145 tumor
specimens was examined by IHC staining. Fatostatin
treatment decreased expression of Ki67 and increased
expression of cPARP in DU145 xenograft tumors
compared to the vehicle-treated group, while no obvious
changes in PC-3 xenograft tumors between the vehicle and
fatostatin-treated groups were shown (Figures 6C and 6D).
The combination of fatostatin and docetaxel led to a
reduction of Ki67 expression and induction of cPARP
expression in both PC-3 and DU145 xenograft tumors
(Figures 6C and 6D). Collectively, the in vivo data suggest
that the combination of fatostatin and docetaxel has
significant anti-tumor efficacy in PCa xenograft models.
We subsequently evaluated the expression of
SREBP downstream target genes, FASN and HMGCR,
two key enzymes for controlling the rate-limiting step of
lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in PC-3 and DU145
xenograft tumors treated with fatostatin and/or docetaxel

and HMGCR in DU145 xenograft tumors but not in PC-3

activity resulting from the combination of fatostatin and

DISCUSSION

complex disease harboring genomic alterations, involving
the AR and p53 genes, and exhibiting aggressive features.
The efficacy of fatostatin on metastatic AR-negative PCa
cells with null or mutant p53s is unknown. In this study,
we revealed that blocking the SREBP-regulated metabolic
pathways by fatostatin had a better inhibitory on the
proliferation of PCa cells with high levels of mutant p53
(PC-3 R248W and DU145) than cells with null (PC-3 EV)
or low levels of mutant p53 (DU145 shp53). Moreover,
pharmacological inhibition of SREBP by fatostatin
significantly suppressed xenograft DU145 tumor growth in
immunodeficient nude mice by decreasing Ki67 expression
and increasing cPARP expression. These in vitro and
in vivo results and an earlier report [16] collectively
suggest that fatostatin not only exhibits anti-tumor activity
in AR-positive PCa cells but also shows efficacy on
metastatic AR-negative PCa with p53 mutations.
Uncontrolled cellular division and growth are cancer
hallmarks. Thus, cell cycle blockade has been considered
as an attractive therapeutic strategy to eliminate cancer
[36, 37]. Eukaryotic cell cycle progression is regulated by
the coordinated activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)
and cyclin complexes [38]. The G2/M transition is largely
dependent on Cyclin B1 and Cdk1 activity, which can be
regulated by p21Waf1/Cip1 [39]. We found that decreased
Cyclin B1 and p-Cdk1 expression was accompanied
by G2/M transition blockade in fatostatin-treated PC-3
R248W and DU145 cells. Additionally, fatostatin had
no effect on the expression of wtp53 downstream targets
such as p21Waf1/Cip1 in PCa cells carrying mutant p53s.
These data suggest that fatostatin induces DNA damage
signaling in a p53 independent manner to trigger cell
cycle arrest in the G2 phase in PC-3 cells harboring mutant
p53s. The intrinsic (mitochondrial-mediated) and extrinsic
(death receptor-mediated) apoptotic pathways converge on
the same terminal “execution” pathway, which is initiated
by the cleavage of caspases [40]. Upon activation of
caspase-3, substrates such as PARP are cleaved, ultimately
leading to programmed cell death [41]. Treatment with
fatostatin induced the activation of mitochondrial-related
caspase-9, and -3 and the cleavage of PARP but not
caspase-8 (data not shown) in PC-3 R248W and DU145
cells, which reveal that fatostatin induces programmed
cell death in PCa cells harboring mutant p53s mainly via
an intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway.
Docetaxel is a standard treatment for mCRPC
patients. In response to docetaxel, most PCa cells
harboring mutant p53s show reduced sensitivity compared
to cells lacking p53 or those with wtp53 [8]. Consistent
with our observation, higher IC50 of docetaxel was
detected in PC-3 R248W cells than that in PC-3 EV cells.
Importantly, docetaxel treatment increased expression
of SREBP-1 and -2 in DU145 cells. Based on these
findings, co-targeting p53 mutation and its associated
pathways activated by docetaxel may improve the

Mutant p53s have been well demonstrated to
promote cancer progression and are implicated in
survival, invasion/migration and metastasis through a
series of molecular mechanisms, including alternations
in DNA-binding ability, changes in the interaction with
other functional proteins or indirectly involvement in
transcriptional regulation [25, 32]. Additionally, PCa
resistance to docetaxel treatment, which is currently
considered incurable, has been shown to be correlated
with p53 mutations [8]. In the present study, we provide
new evidence that mutant p53s regulate expression of
SREBPs and their downstream genes, which have been
shown to affect multiple aspects of PCa, including
tumorigenesis, castration resistance and metastasis
[13, 14]. This novel discovery provides a rationale for
targeting the mutant p53s/SREBP-mediated pathways as
a promising approach to treat aggressive human cancer
harboring mutant p53s and prevent lethal docetaxelresistant progression.
Emerging evidence suggests that wtp53/mutant
p53 is involved in regulating lipid metabolism, and
this alteration may contribute to disease progression in
breast cancer [9, 10]. Our results support the idea that
overexpression of tumor suppressor wtp53 inhibited
expression of SREBP-1 and -2 as well as their targets
associated with the rate-limiting steps of lipogenesis and
cholesterogenesis, FASN and HMGCR, in PC-3 cells.
Moreover, mutant p53s induced activation of SREBP-1
and -2, leading to increased expression of FASN and
HMGCR in PC-3 cells. Conversely, knockdown of
endogenous mutant p53s resulted in inhibition of
SREBPs, FASN and HMGCR expression. Collectively,
these mechanistic data indicated that mutant p53s play an
important role in the activation of the SREBP-regulated
metabolic pathways in PCa cells.
We and others previously reported that targeting
SREBPs transcriptional activities and their downstream
metabolic pathways was a promising therapeutic approach
for the treatment of PCa [15, 16, 33, 34]. Fatostatin,
a new non-sterol synthetic diarylthiazole derivative,
has been shown to inhibit insulin-induced adipogenesis
in mouse fibroblast cells and decrease blood fatty acid
and cholesterol and body weight in obese mice [17].
We demonstrated that fatostatin displayed anti-cancer
activity by interrupting SREBP transcriptional activity in
AR-positive PCa cells [16]. AR is a critical growth and
survival factor in regulation of PCa development and
aggressiveness. We identified an active SREBP binding
site in the 5′-flanking AR promoter region [35]. Through
inhibition of SREBP transcriptional activity, fatostatin
reduced the expression of AR gene and its downstream
target, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), in LNCaP and
C4-2B cells [16]. PCa is a heterogeneous and biologically

therapeutic effectiveness of current anti-PCa drugs and
delay docetaxel resistance in PCa. In the current study,
the combination of fatostatin with docetaxel displayed
synergistic growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in
PCa cells harboring null or mutant p53s in vitro and in
vivo. Notably, this combination was strongly synergistic
in p53 mutant PCa cells, which suggests that this novel
therapeutic approach might exhibit an improved selective
advantage in metastatic PCa cells harboring mutant p53s.
Moreover, the docetaxel has been shown to lead to CRPC
tumor regression via impairing AR nuclear translocation
and activity by a microtubule-associated mechanism [42].
Fatostatin inhibited the expression of AR and PSA genes
through interrupting SREBP transcriptional activity [16].
These promising mechanistic findings provide a critical
insight into the treatment of advanced PCa aggressiveness,
such as mCRPC, through the concerted targeting of
multiple pathways by the combination of fatostatin and
docetaxel (Figure 7C). Currently, docetaxel-resistant PCa
cells are establishing. These docetaxel-resistant PCa cells
as well as other cancer cell lines, such as breast, lung
and renal cancer cells, will be applied to investigate the
therapeutic benefit of fatostatin and/or docetaxel in the
near future.
In summary, we provide evidence that targeting
the SREBP-regulated metabolic pathways by fatostatin
inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis
in metastatic PCa cells harboring p53 mutations.
Additionally, we revealed an innovative preclinical
concept by combining fatostatin with docetaxel to achieve
a strong synergistic anti-cancer effect on PCa cell lines
and xenograft mouse models. Our findings suggest that
fatostatin alone or in combination with docetaxel can be a
potent therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive
PCa, especially PCa harboring mutant p53s.

For transfection experiments, PC-3 cells were
transfected with wtp53, various p53 mutants or empty
vectors using Lipofectamine LTX Plus reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Stable cell clones were established after
the selection with 600 μg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louise, MO). For p53 knockdown studies, p53targeting shRNA or scrambled shRNA lentiviral particles
were used to infect DU145 cells followed by puromycin
(Life Technologies) selection to obtain stable cell clones.

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested and subjected to Western
blot analysis as described previously [14]. The primary
antibodies used in the experiments were as follows:
p53, Cyclin B1, Cdk1, phospho-Cdk1 (p-Cdk1 Tyr15),
capases-9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA),
caspase-3 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), SREBP-1,
FASN, HMGCR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
SREBP-2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction
qPCR analysis was performed as previously
described [15]. Total RNA from cells was isolated by
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and converted
into cDNA using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) was performed using the SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY) Sequences of
primers for TP53, SREBP-1, SREBP-2, ACL, FASN,
SCD-1, HMGCS1, HMGCR, MVK, MVD, LDLR,
INSIG1, SCAP, P21, P53R2, BAX, MDM2 and β-actin
are summarized in Supplemental Table 1.

MATERALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures and reagents
Human metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 (p53-null)
and DU145 (p53-mutant) cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Atlanta biological, Flowery Branch, GA),
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at
37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Human
wtp53, various p53 mutants (V143A, R248W, R175H
and R273H) and control expression constructs were
obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). Human p53
shRNA lentiviral particles were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fatostatin and
docetaxel were purchased from Chembridge Corporation
(San Diego, CA) and Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX),
respectively.

Cell proliferation and clonogenic assays
Cell proliferation and clonogenic assays were
conducted as previously described [15, 16]. To determine
the potential mechanism of drug-drug interactions, we
used CompuSyn software (Cambridge, UK) to calculate
the combination index (CI). A CI of less than 1.0 was
considered to be indicative of synergism.

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
Cell cycle distribution, apoptotic cell death and
caspase activity assays were performed as previously
described [15, 16].

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

All animal procedures were performed in
accordance with a protocol approved by the Institution
Animal Care and Use Committee at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center. The in vivo efficacy of fatostatin and/or docetaxel
was investigated by subcutaneously implanting parental
PC-3 or DU145 cells (1 × 106) in the flank of 4-weekold male athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories,
Indianapolis, IN) in a PBS and BD Matrigel matrix
mixture (100 μl; 1:1, v/v). Mice bearing PC-3 or DU145
tumors with a mean volume of 100 mm3 were randomly
distributed into vehicle control (sterile PBS), fatostatin
(15 mg/kg), docetaxel (5 mg/kg) or combination treated
groups (five mice each group). Mice were weighted once
a week and administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
once daily for fatostatin and twice a week for docetaxel
[16, 17]. During 4-week treatment, tumor volumes were
measured by the caliper and calculated using the formula:
V = 1/2 × length × width2.

Immunohistochemical Staining
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was
performed on xenograft tumor tissues fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned
as described previously [35]. Antibodies used for IHC
staining included Ki67 (Abcam), cleaved PARP, FASN
and HMGCR. The percentage of Ki67 positive cells
(proliferation) or cleaved PARP (cPARP) positive cells
(apoptosis) [16] in tumor tissues from all groups were
calculated in 5 randomly selected microscopic fields at
a 200 × magnification. The total IHC score for FASN
and HMGCR staining was calculated as the value of the
percentage of positive staining × staining intensity, and
ranged from 0 to 12 [43, 44].
