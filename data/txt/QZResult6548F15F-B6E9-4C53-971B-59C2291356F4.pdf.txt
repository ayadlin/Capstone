ABSTRACT
Treatment options for patients with Epstein-Barr Virus-driven lymphoproliferative
diseases (EBV-LPD) are limited. Chemo-immunotherapeutic approaches often lead to
immune suppression, risk of lethal infection and EBV reactivation, thus it is essential
to identify agents that can deliver direct anti-tumor activity while preserving innate
and adaptive host immune surveillance. Silvestrol possesses direct anti-tumor activity
in multiple hematologic malignancies while causing minimal toxicity to normal
mononuclear cells. However, the effects of silvestrol on immune function have not
been described. We utilized in vitro and in vivo models of EBV-LPD to simultaneously
examine the impact of silvestrol on both tumor and normal immune function. We
show that silvestrol induces direct anti-tumor activity against EBV-transformed
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), with growth inhibition, decreased expression of the
EBV oncogene latent membrane protein-1, and inhibition of the downstream AKT,
STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways. Silvestrol promoted potent indirect anti-tumor
effects by preserving expansion of innate and EBV antigen-specific adaptive immune
effector subsets capable of effective clearance of LCL tumor targets in autologous
co-cultures. In an animal model of spontaneous EBV-LPD, silvestrol demonstrated
significant therapeutic activity dependent on the presence of CD8-positive T-cells.
These findings establish a novel immune-sparing activity of silvestrol, justifying
further exploration in patients with EBV-positive malignancies.

the human host. This virus/host coexistence is controlled
by a highly efficient antigen-specific adaptive immune
response that protects immune-competent individuals
from
EBV-driven
pathology.
EBV-seropositive
individuals who become immunocompromised are at
risk for EBV reactivation and development of aggressive
B-cell lymphomas. Current treatments for patients with
EBV-driven lymphomas are of limited benefit and lead
to further immune suppression, risk of opportunistic
infections, and a loss of EBV-specific immunity due to
dysregulation of immune surveillance [2]. Therefore,
novel treatment approaches that target EBV-driven cancers
while maintaining normal immune function are in great
demand.
Silvestrol [3] is a unique agent that possesses
anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer models [4-8].
This capability is attributed to inhibition of translation
initiation, which occurs when silvestrol induces aberrant
dimerization of the RNA helicase eIF4A with capped
mRNA. This effect interferes with normal recruitment of
mRNA to the eIF4F initiation complex, thus preventing
the rapid synthesis of pro-survival and pro-growth proteins
and leading to tumor cell death via caspase-dependent
apoptosis [9-12]. Our group reported that silvestrol
shows in vivo activity in the B-cell malignancies chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic lymphoma
[13] and mantle cell lymphoma [14], and also that
silvestrol appears to be selectively cytotoxic to malignant
B-cells while sparing normal lymphocytes [13]. To date,
however, the effects of silvestrol on normal immune
function have not been evaluated.
Here we show that silvestrol promotes direct
anti-tumor activity against EBV-LPD by blocking
oncogenic pathways driven by the EBV gene product,
latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that silvestrol preserves the anti-tumor
function of innate immune effectors as well as antigenspecific adaptive immune effectors in both in vitro
and in vivo models of EBV-LPD. This highly unusual
activity suggests that silvestrol may provide an entirely
new immune-potentiating therapeutic strategy for this
histologic subset of aggressive lymphomas.

Supplemental Figure 1A) and growth inhibition (MTS
assay; Supplemental Figure 1B) were evaluated at 24,
72, and 120 hr. Moderate but significant anti-tumor
activity was noted both in growth inhibition and viability
assays (p<0.001 and p=0.006, respectively, in silvestrol
treated vs. vehicle control), with a 50% growth inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of approximately 40 nM at 72 hr.
Recent pharmacokinetic work in mice indicates that a
10 nM plasma concentration of silvestrol is attainable in
vivo [22]. Therefore, 10 nM and lower doses were used in
subsequent studies.

Silvestrol induces LMP-1 depletion in LCL
The virally-encoded transmembrane oncoprotein
LMP-1 acts as a constitutively active receptor of the
TNF-R family [23], promotes multiple growth and survival
pathways, suppresses immune-activating cytokines, and
is essential for B-cell transformation [24, 25]. These
properties make it a potentially valuable therapeutic
target for LMP-1-expressing Type II or III EBV-driven
malignancies [26-30]. Therefore, we evaluated expression
of LMP-1 protein, as well as its trans-activator EBNA2, in eight LCL lines (including the six lines used in the
viability and proliferation assays above) by immunoblot 72
hr after treating with silvestrol (Figure 1A). We observed a
notable drop in LMP-1 expression across all LCL tested,
and a corresponding decrease in EBNA-2 in six of the
eight. As shown in a representative LCL (DC9; Figure
1B), LMP-1 levels fall incrementally as a function of time
after a single 10 nM dose of silvestrol, even though the
effect on EBNA-2 in this LCL was minor. Silvestrol had
varying effects on the latent EBV gene products EBNA3A and -3C, however, and did not induce the expression of
the lytic transcription factor BZLF-1 (Figure 1B). Lysates
from Akata cells (Type I latency) incubated with antiIgG to induce lytic cycle and BL41-B95.8 cells (Type III
latency) were included as controls [31-33].
LMP-1 is known to constitutively activate multiple
pro-survival signaling pathways including NF-κB,
PI3K/AKT, STAT1 and STAT3 through its cytoplasmic
C-terminal-activating regions (CTAR1 and 2), biologically
mimicking the TNF family receptor CD40 [25, 34-37].
Thus, LMP-1 promotes tumor cell survival and growth
through diverse mechanisms. To investigate the effects
of silvestrol on these LMP-1-induced pathways, LCL
were incubated for 24, 72 and 120 hr with vehicle or
10 nM silvestrol and cell extracts were analyzed by
immunoblot. While total STAT1 and STAT3 levels
remained unchanged, the levels of their phosphorylated
(activated) forms decreased (Figure 1C). Decreases of
both total AKT and its activated, phosphorylated form
(Figure 1D) were also observed. Unexpectedly, NF-κB
p65 phosphorylation increased with silvestrol treatment,
suggesting activation, although total p65 levels remained
relatively unchanged (Supplemental Figure 2A). Total

RESULTS
Silvestrol promotes direct anti-tumor activity
against LCL
We first evaluated silvestrol’s direct anti-tumor
activity in LCL derived from malignant EBV-LPD tumors
that spontaneously developed in SCID mice engrafted
with PBMC from EBV-seropositive donors [15, 16, 21].
Six different LCL were plated in the presence or absence
of silvestrol, and cell viability (annexin/PI negativity;

levels of NF-κB components p50, p105 and IκBα were
unchanged, as were NF-kB targets Bcl-2 and Bax, and
despite the silvestrol-induced phosphorylation of p65,
none of this phosphorylated p65 was evident in the nuclear
fraction (Supplemental Figure 2A, 2B, 2C). Together,
these data suggest that changes in STAT and AKT, rather
than NF-kB, may underlie the direct anti-tumor effects of
silvestrol.
We next examined the effects of silvestrol on known
short half-life proteins, as we and others have reported
in other cell types [12, 14]. Cyclin D3 and CDK4 were
each notably reduced by 24 hr in three out of four LCL
tested (Supplemental Figure 2D). It is unclear why this
effect differed in one the four LCL (JD22), although
this relative lack of protein effect also corresponded

with reduced growth inhibition by silvestrol in this LCL
(MTS assay; not shown). As an expected consequence
of the silvestrol-mediated depletion of cyclin D3 and
CDK4, phosphorylation of Rb was notably diminished
(Supplemental Figure 2E), consistent with our earlier
findings [14].

Immune effector function is preserved in the
presence of silvestrol in irradiated co-cultures
To explore the immune modulatory activity of
silvestrol in EBV-LPD, co-cultures (CoCx) were created
by lethally irradiating LCL and plating in the presence of
autologous PBMC (1:1 ratio). Under these conditions,

Figure 1: Silvestrol modulates EBV LMP-1 and LMP-1-driven signaling pathways in LCL. (A) LCL (N=8) were incubated

with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 72 hr, and whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for LMP-1 and EBNA-2. β-actin was included as a loading
control. (B) Lysates from LCL incubated 24, 72, and 120 hr with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol were evaluated by immunoblot. Akata cells (latency

silvestrol. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted on day 10. For all results, live events were gathered by gating on cells negative for the

memory adaptive components of PBMC become activated
and expand in response to the antigenic stimuli from the
LCL [15, 16, 21]. CoCx created using three LCL and
their respective autologous PBMC were treated once
with 0 (vehicle control), 2, 5, or 10 nM silvestrol and
incubated for 14 days. Although the total cell numbers
expanded in CoCx in the presence of 5 or 10 nM silvestrol
appeared to be lower than in the vehicle-treated CoCx,
these differences did not reach significance, and all
CoCx conditions exhibited total cell numbers equal to or
greater than unstimulated PBMCs alone (Supplemental
Figure 3A). As no irradiated LCL remain by day 14 (not
shown), this result demonstrates that addition of silvestrol
still allows for expansion of normal effector populations
following exposure to LCL. Immunophenotyping of the
resulting populations showed no statistically significant
differences in both CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) and CD4+

helper T-cells with silvestrol treatment (Supplemental
Figure 3B, 3C; results shown relative to untreated CoCx).
Similarly, no significant differences were seen with
silvestrol treatment in the LCL-induced expansion of
CD56+ NK cells, the majority of the expanded population
(Supplemental Figure 3D). These results indicate that
silvestrol exposure under these conditions is permissive
for viability and growth of innate and adaptive immune
effector cells.

Silvestrol leads to depletion of LCL in nonirradiated co-cultures
We next examined how silvestrol impacts viable,
non-irradiated LCL in the presence of immune effectors.
LCL were incubated 1:1 with their respective autologous

stained with CFSE. Equal numbers were plated with unstained autologous counterparts (LCL-CFSE with PBMC and LCL with PBMCCFSE) and then treated with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 3 or 5 days. At each time point, CoCx were stained with LIVE/DEAD cell stain and
antibodies to CD19 (A, B) for LCL-CFSE CoCx, or CD8 (C, D) or CD56 (E, F) for PBMC-CFSE CoCx. Loss of CFSE mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) indicates an increase in proliferation. Results shown are representative of 3 individual experiments.

PBMC for 10 days after adding a single dose of silvestrol
(0, 2, 5 or 10 nM). Figure 2A shows representative flow
cytometry data for LCL+PBMC CoCx generated from
one donor (data from additional donors are presented in
Supplemental Figure 4). LCL cells (CD3-/CD19+) appear
in the bottom right quadrant of each plot; PBMC-derived
effector populations (CD19-) appear in the left quadrants.
In untreated (vehicle control) conditions, transformed
LCL cells proliferated and matched the expansion of
effector cell subsets, approximately maintaining the 1:1
ratio (Figure 2A upper right panel; all events gated on the
viable population). However, with a one-time addition of
silvestrol, a dose-dependent ablation of viable LCL was
observed (Figure 2A, lower three panels). Results from
three separate experiments are quantified in Figure 2B
and demonstrate a significant loss of LCL in the presence
of silvestrol (p=0.025 for 0 versus 10 nM). Percentages
of CD4+ T-cells appeared to be reduced with silvestrol
treatment as well (Figure 2C), although the differences
were not statistically significant (p=0.537 for 0 versus 10
nM). In contrast, CD8+ T-cells (Figure 2D) and CD56+ NK
cells (Figure 2E) expanded significantly in the presence of
silvestrol (p=0.019 and p=0.032, respectively, for 0 versus
10 nM silvestrol). Importantly, this significant effect was
not observed when LCL were incubated without PBMC in
5 or 10 nM silvestrol under otherwise identical conditions
(Figure 2F). Although a trend toward lower cell numbers
(enumerated using counting beads) was observed in the
presence of silvestrol, this effect did not reach significance
(p=0.072 for 0 versus 10 nM), consistent with the
modest growth inhibitory effects previously mentioned
(Supplemental Figure 1).
Similar cultures were set up and treated with a single
dose of fludarabine (active metabolite 2-fluoro-ara-A), as
this agent has been used clinically to treat LPD. However,
unlike silvestrol, 2-fluoro-ara-A treatment resulted in
outgrowth of LCL (Supplemental Figure 5A, 5B). It also
exhibited indiscriminate cytotoxicity toward the effector
populations, leading to dramatically fewer effectors in
the 2-fluoro-ara-A treated versus untreated conditions
(Supplemental Figure 5B). This is in stark contrast to the
nearly 100% viability of effectors in the silvestrol treated
CoCx.
We next worked to identify which effector subsets
mediate the anti-LCL effect in the presence of silvestrol.
Cells expressing CD8 (CTL), CD14 (monocytes) or
CD56 (NK cells) were depleted from PBMC using
immunomagnetic beads; mock depletion with biotin-only
beads was included as a control. Effector cell numbers
equivalent to the total number in the mock-depleted
condition were added 1:1 with autologous LCL and
incubated with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 10 days. Depleted
cultures in the absence of silvestrol showed varying
outgrowth of LCL; however, silvestrol-treated CoCx all
produced a similar loss of LCL. These results indicate
that each of these immune cell subsets participates in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

anti-tumor activity of the autologous effector population
(Supplemental Figure 6).
To further explore the differential effect of silvestrol
on the proliferative capacity of tumor targets and effector
populations, LCL or PBMC were stained with the
membrane dye CFSE and equal numbers were plated
with their unstained autologous counterparts (LCL-CFSE
with PBMC, and LCL with PBMC-CFSE). Cultures
were treated with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 3 or 5 days
(Figure 3). LCL-CFSE cultures were then stained for
CD19, and PBMC-CFSE cultures were stained for either
CD8 or CD56. Gates were set on the subset of interest
and analyzed for CFSE intensity (proliferating cells
lose CFSE intensity with each cell division). At 3 and 5
days, LCL showed nearly a 50% decrease in proliferation
with silvestrol treatment under these CoCx conditions,
consistent with growth arrest (Figure 3A, 3B). Conversely,
the proliferation rate of both adaptive (CD8+) and innate
(CD56+) immune effectors remained unchanged in
silvestrol-treated versus untreated CoCx (Figure 3C-3F),
as indicated by little or no change in CFSE intensity.
These results indicate that silvestrol differentially affects
cell proliferation in tumor cells versus immune effector
subsets.

Silvestrol preserves cytotoxic function of adaptive
and innate immune effectors
We next analyzed immune cell function as part of
the indirect anti-tumor activity of silvestrol. Viable LCL
cells were stained with CFSE, and then incubated at an
effector-to-target ratio of 20:1 with autologous PBMC
that had been expanded in the presence of irradiated
LCL, with or without silvestrol, for 14 days. After a 4
hr incubation, cells were stained with the viability dye
7-AAD and washed. Direct cytotoxic activity of effectors
against the CFSE-labeled LCL targets was measured by
gating on CFSE-positive events and measuring 7-AADpositive cells. As shown in Figure 4A, effector cells
expanded in the presence of silvestrol largely maintained
their cytotoxic activity against autologous LCL compared
to effector cells expanded in the absence of silvestrol
(N=3; differences between 0 and 10 nM silvestrol were
not significant).
Given that LCL cells were depleted and effector
cell cytotoxic function was maintained in non-irradiated
CoCx, we hypothesized that silvestrol lowers the apoptotic
threshold of LCL. To address this, PBMC were cocultured with irradiated LCL for 14 days. These expanded
immune effector cells (comprised of both CD8+ T-cells
and CD56+ NK cells) and fresh, viable LCL were then
incubated separately with silvestrol or vehicle control for
18 hr and washed. Cells were then combined, and after
a 4 hr incubation, cytotoxicity assays were performed as
described above. Silvestrol-treated effectors showed no

decrease in their ability to kill LCL targets compared to
untreated effectors (p=0.287; Figure 4B). However, LCL
target cells pre-treated with silvestrol were more efficiently
killed compared to untreated targets (p=0.002). These data
indicate that silvestrol, even at concentrations that show
minimal direct cytotoxicity, significantly increases the
sensitivity of tumor cells to effector cell-mediated killing.
Next, we utilized ADCC assays to measure the
innate immune response of NK cells to LCL tumor targets
in the presence of silvestrol. Effector cells were expanded
in the presence of irradiated LCL, with or without 10 nM
silvestrol, for 14 days prior to enriching for NK cells via
negative selection. Fresh CFSE-labeled LCL targets were
incubated with rituximab (anti-CD20, expressed on LCL
targets) or the negative control antibody herceptin (antiHER2) in the presence of NK cells. After 4 hr, ADCC
was evaluated by gating on CFSE events (stained targets)
and analyzing the percentage of 7-AAD positive cells.
Rituximab-mediated ADCC of NK cells was similar

between effectors expanded with versus without silvestrol
(p=0.838; Figure 4C). To determine the acute effect of
silvestrol on ADCC, fresh (non-autologous) NK cells
were obtained from healthy donors, incubated 18 hr with
or without 10 nM silvestrol, then washed and mixed with
CFSE-stained LCL. As shown in Figure 4D, silvestrol preincubation had no significant effect on the ADCC activity
of freshly isolated NK cells (p=0.854).

We next examined the effect of silvestrol on the
development of EBV antigen-specific CTL. Effector
populations were expanded for 14 days in the presence
of irradiated LCL with or without silvestrol. A flow
cytometric tetramer assay was used to analyze the ability
of antigen-specific CTL to detect the immunodominant

both CFSE and 7-AAD were enumerated by flow cytometry. Data are shown relative to the vehicle-only control and are the averages of
three independent experiments. Bars show mean ± SD. Differences were not significant (ns). (B) Effectors were expanded in the presence

of three independent experiments. Bars show mean ± SD. (C) Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay using NK

measured by CFSE and 7-AAD dual-positive events. Data are shown relative to the positive control (effectors + targets + ritux, without
silvestrol) and are the averages of three individual experiments. Bars show mean ± SD. (D) ADCC assays were performed as in (C), but

HLA-B8-restricted RAK epitope of the EBV lytic protein
BZLF-1, as previously described [18]. BZLF-1 has been
shown to play an important role in the development of B
cell lymphomas, although the precise mechanism remains
unclear [38]. The CTL present in baseline PBMC not
exposed to irradiated LCL exhibit very low-level detection
of EBV BZLF-1 antigen; however, effectors expanded in
the presence of irradiated LCL show significant increases
in BZLF-1-specific CTL (p<0.001; Figure 5A). Regardless
of silvestrol treatment, all PBMC cultures exposed to
irradiated LCL showed significant expansion of BZLF-1specific CD8+ T-cells (p<0.001 for each condition relative
to baseline PBMC), although the expansion with 10 nM
silvestrol was less than in the untreated (vehicle control)
condition (p = 0.019). These results demonstrate that at
least at these low concentrations, silvestrol does not block
the development of antigen-specific CTL (Figure 5A).

Since effectors expanded in the presence of
silvestrol maintain the ability to recognize HLA-presented
viral peptide, we next evaluated the expression of
immunological synapse proteins on effectors and targets,
as modulation of these proteins has been shown as a
mechanism for tumor immune escape [39, 40]. First, LCL
from 3 donors were incubated for 48 hr with 0 or 10 nM
silvestrol. After incubation, LCL were analyzed for MHC
class I (HLA-ABC), co-stimulatory molecules (CD70,
CD80 and CD86), and integrin-binding protein CD54
(ICAM-1). Incubation with silvestrol did not significantly
alter the intensity of expression of class I MHC, nor
did it have a significant impact on the expression of costimulatory molecules or ICAM-1 on tumor cells (Figure
5B). Next, we analyzed the cognate immunological
synapse molecules on the surface of activated immune
effector cells. PBMC from 3 donors were incubated with

Figure 5: Antigen specific immune responses are maintained in the presence of silvestrol. (A) Effectors were expanded 14

days in the presence of irradiated LCL, with or without silvestrol as indicated, using LCL and autologous PBMC from one HLA-B8 donor.
A flow cytometric HLA-tetramer assay was used to analyze the ability of antigen-specific CTL to detect EBV BZLF-1 protein bound to
MHC class I. The increase in BZLF-1-specific CTL following exposure to irradiated LCL was significant under all conditions (p<0.001 for
each 0, 2, 5 and 10 nM silvestrol treatment compared to non-exposed, baseline PBMC), although the expansion with 10 nM silvestrol was
less than in the 0 nM (vehicle control) condition (p=0.019). (B) LCL were incubated in 0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 48 hr and analyzed for
surface expression of immunological synapse and co-activation proteins. Change in MFI when treated with silvestrol is shown. Bars show
mean ± SD from 3 individual donors; differences with silvestrol treatment relative to vehicle were not significant. (C) PBMC from the same
3 donors as in (B) were incubated with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 24 hr followed by stimulation with 1 µg/ml anti-hu-CD3 for 18 hr. PBMCs
were gated on live, CD8+ T-cells, and cognate molecules to those shown in (B) were analyzed for change in MFI with silvestrol treatment.
Bars show mean ± SD; differences with silvestrol treatment were not significant. (D) Real-Time RT-PCR analysis of ICAM-1 expression
relative to TBP (control gene) in LCL (N=3) incubated 48 hr with 0 or 10 nM silvestrol. Fold change was calculated using the ΔΔCt method
[54]. The silvestrol-induced increase in ICAM-1 at the mRNA level was borderline significant (p=0.047).

0 or 10 nM silvestrol for 24 hr followed by overnight
stimulation with anti-human CD3. Cells were incubated
with labeled antibodies to the molecules of interest and
evaluated by flow cytometry, gating on live, CD8+ events.
Silvestrol did not significantly affect surface levels of CD8
(T-cell co-receptor and MHC class I binding protein),
CD27 (co-stimulatory molecule that binds CD70), CD28
(CD80/86 activating binding partner), or LFA-1 (integrin
that is bound by ICAM-1 to stabilize the synapse).
Although silvestrol treatment decreased expression of the
inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 on some CTL, these effects
were more variable between samples and thus overall did
not reach significance (Figure 5C). As LMP-1 has been
shown to induce the transcription of ICAM-1 [41], we
analyzed ICAM-1 transcript levels by real-time RT-PCR.
Unexpectedly, despite the silvestrol-mediated depletion
of LMP-1, ICAM-1 transcript was moderately but
significantly increased with silvestrol treatment (p=0.047;
Figure 5D). Together, these data demonstrate that silvestrol
does not significantly impact activating components of the
immunological synapse or co-stimulatory molecules on
tumor targets. Importantly, CTL expanded in the presence
of silvestrol retain the ability to recognize and proliferate
in response to EBV recall antigens presented on LCL
tumor cells.

while spleens from silvestrol-treated animals exhibited
normal spleen mass (Figure 6B). Spleens from both
treatment groups were also obtained from each animal
as euthanasia criteria were met, or for the silvestroltreated mice, at the end of study (140 days). Mice in
the vehicle control group showed significantly enlarged
spleens relative to silvestrol-treated mice (p<0.01; Figure
6C). Finally, silvestrol significantly prolonged survival
compared to vehicle (7/7 silvestrol-treated mice vs. 2/9
control mice alive at day 140, p<0.004; Figure 6D). At the
end of the study, all animals were examined for presence
of EBV-LPD by necropsy as well as flow cytometric
evaluation of spleen cells. While the remaining vehicletreated mice exhibited substantial tumor infiltration of the
spleen, no such lymphocyte infiltration could be detected
in the spleens of any of the silvestrol-treated mice, nor did
these animals exhibit any other obvious signs of lymphoma
upon necropsy (not shown). We also evaluated normal
blood cell populations following silvestrol treatment (1.5
mg/kg IP every other day for 28 days) in healthy, immunecompetent C57BL/6 mice. No significant changes were
found in total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and erythrocyte
subsets, although a moderate (approximately 1.4 fold)
increase in platelets was observed (Supplemental Figure
7A). Total spleen cells from these healthy mice were also
investigated for effects on normal lymphocyte subsets; no
differences were found with silvestrol treatment on murine
CD4+ or CD8+ (T-cell), CD19+ (B-cell) or NK1.1+ (NK
cell) subsets.

In vivo efficacy of silvestrol in the hu-PBL-SCID
model of EBV-LPD
The hu-PBL SCID model has been used to identify
experimental therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat
spontaneous EBV-LPD [15, 16, 42-45]. PBMC from a
healthy EBV-positive donor were injected into a group of
SCID mice that had been pretreated with anti-asialo (GM1)
to deplete murine NK cells. Mice were randomized (N=14/
group), and IP treatments with vehicle or silvestrol (1.5
mg/kg) every 48 hr began 2 weeks after engraftment. Two
weeks after treatment began (4 weeks post-engraftment),
an ELISA was performed to evaluate human IgG plasma
levels. All 28 mice were shown to produce human IgG
(Figure 6A), with no significant difference between the
silvestrol-treated versus vehicle-treated groups. This
finding not only confirmed successful engraftment,
but also showed that silvestrol did not adversely affect
production of human IgG by xenografted B-lymphocytes,
suggesting that silvestrol also may allow the preservation
of adaptive humoral immune responsiveness. At 4 and
8 weeks post-engraftment, flow cytometry analysis (huCD45+/CD19+/CD3-) was performed on spleen cells from
2 mice in each group. Mice in the vehicle control group
showed substantial tumor infiltration of the spleen without
obvious nodal involvement, whereas no tumor cells could
be detected in the spleens of mice from the silvestroltreated group (not shown). By 8 weeks post-engraftment,
spleens from mice in the control group showed profound
splenomegaly characterized by human B-cell infiltration,

CD8+ T lymphocytes are necessary for in vivo
efficacy of silvestrol
To further investigate the importance of immune
effector cells in silvestrol’s dramatic protective effect in
EBV-LPD, the previous in vivo experiment was repeated
with prior depletion of specific human lymphocyte
subsets. Before engraftment, PBMC were subjected to
immunomagnetic bead depletion for cells carrying CD8
(CTL), CD14 (monocytes), or CD56 (NK cells). Mock
depletion was performed using biotin-conjugated beads
as a negative control. Efficiency of depletion was verified
by flow cytometric analyses to be greater than 90%
(Supplemental Figure 8). A total of 5x107 mock-depleted
PBMC, or equivalent percentages from each of the subset
depletions as described previously [18], were engrafted
into SCID mice depleted of murine NK cells by anti-asialo
injections (N=5/group). As with the prior experiment, IP
treatment with 1.5 mg/kg silvestrol or vehicle every 48 hr
began 2 weeks after engraftment. Prior experience with
this model shows PBMC depleted of CD3/CD8+, CD56+,
or CD14+ cells do not affect human cell engraftment and
production of human IgG levels [16]. Two weeks after
treatment began (4 weeks post-engraftment), an ELISA
was performed to evaluate human IgG. Only mice shown
to be engrafted by production of human IgG were used

numbers of depleted PBMC preparations (5x107 cells in the mock-depleted condition) were engrafted by intraperitoneal injection into
murine NK cell-depleted SCID mice (N=5 per group). After 4 weeks, human Ig levels were assessed by ELISA, and only mice showing

silvestrol-treated (N=5) vs. non-depleted silvestrol-treated (N=4) was not significant. Also, there was no difference between CD8-depleted
vs. non-depleted vehicle controls (not shown).

in the study. The mock-depleted mice showed results
similar to the previous experiment, with 0/3 surviving
in the vehicle group and 4/4 surviving in the silvestroltreated group (p=0.029) (Figure 6E). Notably, when
CD8+ T-cells were depleted, silvestrol no longer provided
effective anti-tumor protection (0/4 surviving in silvestroltreated CD8-depleted group versus 4/4 in the silvestroltreated mock-depleted group; p=0.029), nor did it reduce
tumor burden as measured by spleen mass (not shown).
Mice receiving CD14+ (monocyte) or CD56+ (NK cell)
depleted engraftments exhibited an intermediate response
to silvestrol treatment (2/4 and 4/5 surviving, respectively)
that did not reach statistical significance with this number
of animals. These data indicate that silvestrol is indirectly
mediating protection through immune surveillance
mechanisms, and that at least CD8+ T-lymphocytes are
essential in the silvestrol-mediated clearance of tumor.

The direct growth inhibitory activity of silvestrol
as well its ability to sensitize LCL to immunemediated killing appears to be associated with a loss
of the LMP-1 oncoprotein. Drugs and cytotoxic T-cell
preparations directly targeting LMP-1 have been shown
to prevent metastasis, promote apoptosis and enhance
radiosensitivity, identifying LMP-1 as a potential
therapeutic target for EBV-driven malignancies [2630]. The ablation of LMP-1 protein has been shown to
interfere with several downstream signaling pathways
including AKT [28] as well as STAT1 and STAT3 [34,
36, 49], and our results support these findings. Inhibition
of these pathways may lower tumor apoptotic threshold
and allow sensitization to effector immune cell anti-tumor
activity [6, 11]. Certainly, we observed that low doses
of silvestrol enhanced sensitivity of LCL tumor targets
to innate and adaptive immune effector-mediated killing
while producing little to no effect on those effector cells’
functional capabilities. We are presently investigating
the mechanism accounting for this reduced apoptotic
threshold in LCL. It was previously reported that the
classical chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel, cisplatin,
and doxorubicin sensitize several types of solid tumor
cells to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes by increasing tumor cell
permeability to granzyme B [50].
It has been previously reported that silvestrol
sensitizes tumor cells to classical chemotherapeutic agents
including doxorubicin [6, 11]. However, as standard
chemotherapies used in the treatment of lymphoma
impair adaptive and innate cell-mediated immunity, such
combinations may potentially circumvent the immunepreserving advantage of silvestrol. Here we describe
an entirely new characteristic of silvestrol, which is the
maintenance of adaptive immune effectors (EBV-specific
CTL) and innate immune effectors (NK cells) using
concentrations that have direct, albeit moderate, antitumor activity. These studies employed an established in
vitro model in which EBV-driven lymphoma cells (LCL)
are incubated with autologous PBMC. Left untreated,
the LCL ultimately outpace the expanding effector
populations, and overtake the culture. With the addition
of as little as 10 nM silvestrol, we observed complete
ablation of viable LCL in these autologous co-cultures
while effector cell populations (i.e. CD8+ CTL and
CD56+ NK cells) were maintained; importantly, this effect
of silvestrol on LCL is greatly reduced in the absence
of effector cells. Furthermore, proliferation assays in
silvestrol-treated co-cultures show a substantial decrease
in proliferation of LCL targets without a corresponding
change in proliferation of effector cells. We are currently
investigating the differential activity of silvestrol on
cell cycle checkpoints in tumor versus immune effector
populations.
Besides affecting absolute cell numbers, classical
chemotherapy is known to have a deleterious effect on
cancer-relevant immune cell function including NK

DISCUSSION
EBV is associated with a broad spectrum of benign
and malignant diseases that, collectively, represent
a growing number of cases in immunocompromised
individuals and in our aging population [46-48]. Current
therapies for EBV-LPD often lead to profound immune
suppression and subsequent development of lifethreatening opportunistic infections and EBV reactivation.
Thus, an ideal agent to treat patients with EBV-LPD would
possess direct anti-tumor activity while preserving the host
anti-tumor immune function. Previous studies showed
the direct anti-tumor activity of the translation inhibitor
silvestrol in leukemia and lymphoma [3, 6, 11-14], and
selective cytotoxicity to malignant B-cells compared to
normal lymphocytes [13]. This activity appears to be due
to the loss of short half-life protective proteins resulting
from direct translation inhibition. Here we show that,
in addition to this activity, silvestrol is also an immunepreserving agent. We provide a characterization of the
unique anti-tumor and immune-potentiating properties of
this drug using in vitro and in vivo models of EBV-LPD.
Our principle findings show that direct antiproliferative activity of silvestrol toward LCL at
physiologically achievable concentrations is moderate.
However, these low concentrations of silvestrol, when
added to co-cultures of LCL and autologous PBMC,
produce complete ablation of the malignant LCL cells.
Importantly, the in vivo EBV-LPD model revealed a
remarkable survival advantage with silvestrol treatment,
far greater than we and others have previously shown
with silvestrol using xenografts in immune deficient mice
[13, 14]. Together, these results indicate that the indirect
effects of silvestrol on tumor cells via innate and adaptive
immune components may be at least as important as its
direct effects. As most in vivo studies with silvestrol to
date have used tumor xenografts in immune deficient
mice, this crucial aspect was previously unknown.

METHODS

cell-mediated ADCC [51, 52]. Our experiments show
that silvestrol does not significantly impact NK cell
ADCC activity, either when NK cells were expanded in
the presence of silvestrol or when silvestrol was added
immediately prior to the ADCC assay. Additionally,
EBV proteins also mediate multiple effects to evade
adaptive immune detection of virally-infected cells, and
appropriate adaptive immune recognition of EBV proteins
by CTL is essential to avoid development of EBV-related
malignancies [53]. CTL exposed to silvestrol retained
the ability to recognize presented viral peptide in the
context of class I MHC, and showed little or no change
in cytotoxic function or in expression of immune synapse
components. As silvestrol treatment does not impede the
expansion of EBV-specific CTL or alter the expression
of immune synapse or co-stimulatory molecules, this
may explain how silvestrol treatment can preserve
immunological responsiveness against EBV-LPD.
Our in vivo studies using the hu-PBL SCID model
provide significant insight into the efficacy of silvestrol
in treating EBV-LPD. Importantly, our in vivo experiment
using grafts depleted of effector cell subsets establishes
that CD8+ CTL are necessary for full silvestrol efficacy
in this model. The moderate loss of protection when other
lymphocyte subsets are depleted suggests that silvestrol
is sensitizing tumor cells for clearance through other
immune effectors as well, although a larger study is
required to address this. Furthermore, in vivo experiments
using animals with intact immune systems did not show
significant alteration in total lymphocytes or modulation
in lymphocyte populations with silvestrol treatment,
consistent with previously reported data [12]. Together,
these studies provide further evidence of silvestrol’s
limited toxicity to immune effectors.
In summary, we present new information regarding
the efficacy of the translation inhibitor silvestrol in
EBV-LPD and demonstrate that this efficacy is largely
due to the maintenance of number and function of both
innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune components.
Additionally, silvestrol promotes modest direct antitumor activity against EBV-transformed lymphoma cells,
likely by depleting the oncogenic viral protein LMP1 and interfering with downstream survival pathways.
Other chemotherapeutic regimens currently in use
for the treatment of EBV-LPD display a non-specific
cytotoxicity both to the tumor target as well as immune
effectors, leading to elimination of potent memory antitumor responses. This effect leaves patients vulnerable
to disease relapse and at increased risk of serious and
potentially lethal opportunistic infections. The ability of
silvestrol to simultaneously exert direct anti-proliferative
activity against EBV-transformed tumor cells while
sparing adaptive and innate immune effector function is
highly unusual if not unique, and shows promise for future
clinical translation.

Ethics statement
Investigations were conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines, and were approved by the OSU institutional
review board.

Reagents
Silvestrol was isolated as described [3]. The active
metabolite of fludarabine, 2-fluoro-ara-A, was obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Cells and cultures
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL)
were derived in vivo by engrafting severe combined
immune-deficient (SCID) mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY)
with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
from healthy EBV-positive donors [15, 16]. Co-cultures
(CoCx) were created in 96-well plates by mixing LCL
(either non-irradiated or irradiated with 14,000 rad) with
equal numbers of autologous PBMC. Cultures were
grown in the presence of 10 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2;
Prometheus, San Diego, CA), and were given a single
dose of silvestrol (10 nM) before being cultured for 10-14
days.

Immunoblot analysis
LCL were subjected to immunoblotting as described
[17]. Antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA) (β-actin, pSTAT1, pSTAT3, STAT1,
STAT3, pAkt, or Akt) or DakoCytomation (Carpinteria,
CA) (LMP-1).

Proliferation assays
MTS assays to measure mitochondrial function
were performed using the CellTiter96TM assay (Promega,
Madison, WI).

Flow cytometric analyses
Cells were co-stained with LIVE/DEAD reagent
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and hu-CD3-APC, as
well as hu-CD4-PE, hu-CD8-PE, hu-CD19-PE (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA), or hu-CD56-PE (Beckman

Coulter, Brea, CA). Events were gathered by gating on
cells negative for the LIVE/DEAD stain on an FC500
cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Cell viability also was
measured by flow cytometry using annexin-V-FITC
and propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences). Human
HLA-B8 tetramers complexed with immunodominant
peptide from BZLF-1 (RAKFKQLL) and conjugated
with allophycocyanin (APC) [18] were provided by the
NIAID Tetramer Facility and the NIH AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program (Atlanta, Georgia). Where
indicated, cell counting beads were used to obtain cell
numbers according to manufacturer’s description (BD
Biosciences).

β-cyclodextrin; CTD Holdings, Inc., Alachua, FL) or
silvestrol (1.5 mg/kg every 48 hr IP) began 2 weeks postengraftment.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR
ICAM-1 (CD54) mRNA levels were determined
using the Viia7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using TaqMan Gene
Expression Assays for ICAM-1 and TBP (control)
(Applied Biosystems).

Statistics

Cytotoxicity assays

To account for correlations among observations
from the same donor, linear mixed effects models were
used to estimate the effect of silvestrol on apoptosis and
cell proliferation. Similarly, differences in rituximabmediated NK cell ADCC activity in effectors expanded in
the presence versus absence of silvestrol were examined
using mixed effects models. Differences in cell numbers
of each of the four subsets (CD3-/CD19+, CD3+/CD8+,
CD3-/CD56+, and CD3+/CD4+) were compared between
cells incubated with versus without silvestrol using paired
t-tests. Differences in surface expression of immunological
synapse proteins in activated effectors incubated with
versus without silvestrol were also examined using paired
t-tests, with an adjusted significance level of 0.01 to
control overall Type I error. The proportions of mice alive
at end of study were compared between the vehicle control
and silvestrol-treated groups using Fisher’s exact test.
Finally, spleen size differences between silvestrol-treated
and control mice were assessed using a two-sample t-test.
All analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Non-radioactive flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity
assays were performed as described [19, 20]. CoCx
(PBMC plus irradiated LCL) were incubated in the
presence or absence of silvestrol (10 nM) for 14
days. Fresh autologous LCL cells were stained with
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE;
CellTraceTM, Invitrogen) prior to being mixed with
effectors from the irradiated CoCx at an effector:target
ratio of 20:1. Cells were stained with the viability dye
7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD Biosciences) and
washed. Cytotoxicity was measured by gating on CFSEpositive events and measuring 7-AAD-positive cells. For
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
assays, co-cultured effectors were natural killer (NK) cellenriched and were incubated in the presence or absence
of 5 µg/ml rituximab or the irrelevant control antibody
herceptin (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA).

Proliferation assays
CFSE-stained PBMCs were incubated with
unstained autologous LCLs, and CFSE-stained LCLs were
incubated with autologous unstained PBMCs. At days 3
and 5, cells were stained with anti-CD19-APC for CFSELCL, or anti-CD56-APC or anti-CD8-APC for CFSEPBMC, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
