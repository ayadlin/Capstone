Abstract
Boosting therapeutically relevant immunity against lethal
epithelial tumors may require targeting tumor-induced
immunosuppression on an individualized basis. Here, we
show that, in the ovarian carcinoma microenvironment,
CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells spontaneously engulf tumor
materials but, rather than enhancing antitumor immunity,
suppress T-cell function. In situ costimulation of CD40 and
Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 on tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells
decreased their L-arginase activity, enhanced their production
of type I IFN and interleukin-12 (p70), augmented their
capacity to process antigens, and up-regulated costimulatory
molecules in vivo in mice and in vitro in human dissociated
tumors. Synergistic CD40/TLR activation also induced the
migration of activated dendritic cells to lymphatic locations
and promoted their capacity to present antigens. Correspondingly, without exogenous antigen, combined CD40/TLR agonists boosted measurable T-cell–mediated antitumor
immunity and induced the rejection of otherwise lethal i.p.
ovarian carcinomas. Our results highlight the potential of
transforming tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (the most
abundant leukocyte subset in the solid ovarian carcinoma
microenvironment) from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory cell type. Combined administration of synergistic CD40 and TLR3 agonists could enhance their individual
therapeutic effects against ovarian and other lethal epithelial
cancers. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7329–37]

Introduction
Dendritic cells are best known for initiating T-cell–mediated
immune responses. Consequently, multiple strategies aimed at
using the immunostimulatory potential of adoptively administered
dendritic cells have been attempted to boost therapeutically
relevant immune responses against established human cancers.
Unfortunately, although measurable immunologic enhancement
has been routinely attained and new promising strategies are under
investigation, the emerging view is that the dendritic cell–based
vaccination approaches tested thus far do not effectively induce
cancer regression in most patients (1, 2).

In the United States alone, epithelial ovarian cancer claimed the
lives of >15,000 women in 2008 (3). Regrettably, chemotherapies
implemented in the last 30 years have led to a 5-year survival
rate of 30%, at best, for patients with metastatic ovarian carcinoma,
the stage at which most cases are diagnosed (3). Although the
lethality of the disease has traditionally reduced the number of
potential advocates, the need for new complementary treatments is
increasingly clear. Interestingly, ovarian cancer is an ideal target for
novel immunotherapies for several reasons. Firstly, studies
pioneered by Coukos and colleagues indicate that ovarian cancer
naturally triggers anticancer immune responses (4–7). Secondly,
although ovarian cancer is a devastating disease, metastases are
frequently restricted to the peritoneal cavity where the tumor
microenvironment is directly accessible, which prevents the need
for systemic delivery of immunostimulatory treatments. Thirdly,
CD11c+DEC-205+MHC-IIlowCD11b- dendritic cells expressing low to
undetectable levels of costimulatory CD80 represent the most
frequent leukocytic subset in the microenvironment of mouse and
human solid ovarian carcinomas (8–11), hence promoting their
inherent immunostimulatory potential may prove the most
effective therapy yet.
To boost endogenous immunity against different epithelial
tumors, signaling through CD40 has also been attempted with
promising results, although therapeutic effectiveness was limited
by toxicity (12, 13). In independent trials, Toll-like receptor (TLR)
agonists have also been individually implemented as adjuvants
(14). Furthermore, recent reports in nontumor systems indicate
that a combinatorial stimulation of TLRs and TRAF signaling by
CD40 cross-linking generates a 10- to 20-fold increase in the
number of activated CD8+ T cells compared with either agonist
alone (15). In murine nonepithelial tumors, CD40/TLR7 agonists
have been used as adjuvants in vaccination using exogenous tumor
antigen, which resulted in stronger and less toxic antitumor
memory T-cell responses compared with monotherapy (16).
We have shown previously that CD11c+ dendritic cells sorted
from ovarian cancer–bearing mice are competent phagocytes but
cannot efficiently present ovalbumin to transgenic T cells before
receiving an aggressive stimulatory cocktail (9). In addition, the
elimination of dendritic cells from tumor locations delays ovarian
cancer progression by boosting measurable T-cell–mediated
antitumor immunity (17), and previous reports show that human
ovarian cancer–associated dendritic cells express functional
levels of immunosuppressive PD-L1 (18). However, there is no
direct evidence that CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells from ovarian
carcinoma specimens suppress antigen-specific T-cell responses.
We hypothesized that, if ovarian dendritic cells acted as bona fide
immunosuppressive cells in the ovarian carcinoma microenvironment where they massively accumulate (9, 10), reversing their

tolerogenic phenotype in vivo while promoting their capacity to
present tumor antigens that they spontaneously engulf could elicit
therapeutically effective antitumor immunity. To test this hypothesis, we administered a cocktail of CD40 and TLR3 agonists (16).
Preceding synergistic cancer interventions were limited to TLR7
targeting; however, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the main
subset of dendritic cells which express TLR7 (and TLR3 at almost
undetectable levels) in both mouse and human (19, 20). We show
here that the activation of TLR3, expressed on ovarian tumor–
associated CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells, synergizes with CD40
agonist to induce dendritic cells maturation in situ, which reverses
their immunosuppressive phenotype and induces T-cell responses
that lead to the rejection of otherwise lethal ovarian carcinomas.

Materials and Methods

and Use Committee. Stage III to IV human ovarian carcinoma specimens
were procured through Research Pathology Services at Dartmouth under an
approved protocol. Single-cell suspensions were generated as described
previously (21).
For treatments, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were i.p. injected with 1.5  106
ID8-luciferase (17), ID8-GFP, or ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A ovarian carcinoma cells.
At days 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-tumor challenge, mice received i.p. injections
of PBS, irrelevant rat IgG (50 Ag/mouse), anti-CD40 antibody (FGK4.5;
BioExpress; 50 Ag/mouse), or poly(inosinic-cytidylic acid) [poly(I:C);
Invivogen; 100 Ag/mouse] in combination or alone or one dose 21 days
post-tumor challenge unless otherwise stated. Flagellin was purified as
described previously (22).
For visualization of tumor burden, mice were injected with 0.2 mL of 15
mg/mL luciferin (Promega). After 10 min, animals were anesthetized with
isoflurane and imaged using the IVIS 200 system (Xenogen).
We obtained the CP-870,893 monoclonal antibody from Pfizer.
Ascites from mice bearing ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A for 31 days was sorted
for CD45+CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells [tumor-derived dendritic cells
(tDC)] and used in the assay. Bone marrow–derived dendritic cells

Activation of Ovarian Cancer Dendritic Cells
(BMDC) or tDC were cultured with 50 Ag/mL full-length ovalbumin (Sigma)
at 106/mL for 3 h. Negatively bead selected CD3+ OT-I splenocytes (1  105)
were then CFSE labeled and added to ovalbumin-pulsed BMDC or
ovalbumin-pulsed tDC (sorted from tumor ascites) in a 10:1 ratio. Either
unpulsed tDC or bovine serum albumin (50 Ag/mL)–pulsed BMDC were
introduced into BMDC/ovalbumin + CFSE OT-I cocultures at various ratios.
(At day 5, the total T-cell count was f4  105). We then collected 30,000
events to detect CFSE dye dilution peaks.

Arginase Activity Assay
In vivo activated dendritic cells were sorted from either the peritoneal
cavity or combined, inguinal, axillary, and brachial lymph nodes of tumorbearing mice. Quantitative colorimetric arginase determination was
done using an Arginase Activity Detection kit (BioAssay Systems). Briefly,

0.05  106 to 0.25  106 cells were washed and lysed for 10 min in 50 AL
of 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 mmol/L pepstatin A,
0.2 mmol/L leupeptin, and 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100. Lysates were then used
to complete the assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

ELISPOT
Total cells were either obtained from peritoneal washes or dissociated
spleens of treated or untreated ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumor-bearing mice.
Peritoneal cells were cocultured for 48 h, in coated and blocked ELISPOT
plates, among BMDC in a 10:1 ratio, which were previously pulsed (overnight)
with doubly treated (Gamma irradiated and UV-treated) ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A
cells (10 dendritic cells:1 tumor cell). Splenocytes were first primed in 24-well
plates in a 10:1 ratio with BMDC either pulsed with doubly treated tumor
cells or with the peptide mesothelin (GQKMNAQAI; New England Peptide) for

with specified antigen or tumor-pulsed BMDC (10:1 ratio) for 24 h. All cultures
were maintained in complete RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
Analysis was then continued according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(eBioscience).

Immunohistochemistry
Ovaries of mice were collected and embedded in Tissue-Tek, after
which 8 Am sections were made from frozen tissue blocks. Slides were then
fixed with acetone and washed with PBS. Sections were then blocked using
a-CD32 followed by staining with either biotinylated a-CD8 (53-6.7) or
a-CD3 (145-2C11; eBioscience) and completion of immunohistochemical
procedure according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Vector Labs).
Slides were then viewed at 200 and positive cells were quantified using an
image analyzing software (NIS-Element Imaging).

Statistical Analyses
Differences between the means of experimental groups were analyzed
using the Mann-Whitney test and survival was analyzed with the log-rank
test, both using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 software.
Division indices, defined as average number of cell divisions that the
responding cells underwent, were calculated using FlowJo software.

Results

Cytokine Detection
Either peritoneal lavages (10 mL PBS) or culture supernatants were used
in ELISA assays for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12 (p70), IFN-a, and IFN-h
(eBioscience and PBL Biomedical Lab, respectively) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Tumor necrosis factor-a was detected
using a Mouse-5-Plex panel cytokine assay (Bio-Rad) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. For in vivo analysis, sorted peritoneal cells
(106/mL) from treated or control animals were stimulated for 4 h with
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (50 ng/1 Ag/mL).

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry was done on a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences). Sorting was
done on a FACSAria sorter (BD Biosciences).

CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells from the ovarian carcinoma
microenvironment suppress T-cell function but can be
activated to become efficient antigen-presenting cells in vitro.
To define the regulatory nature of ovarian cancer–associated
dendritic cells, we first confirmed that CFSE-labeled, negatively
selected, transgenic OT-I splenic T cells proliferated very poorly in
response to tDC pulsed with ovalbumin (9), whereas BMDC
induced a robust expansion (Fig. 1A). To show the ability of
tDC to suppress naive CD8 T-cell proliferation, we next analyzed
the proliferation of OT-I lymphocytes incubated with the same
ovalbumin-pulsed BMDC in the presence of two different ratios of

Activation of Ovarian Cancer Dendritic Cells

CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells sorted from tumor ascites. Notably,
the addition of tumor dendritic cells abrogated the expansion of
transgenic T cells (Fig. 1B). This was not caused by a potential
interference with access of lymphocytes to pulsed dendritic cells,
because ovalbumin-pulsed and washed BMDC, mixed with
identical ratios of irrelevant protein-pulsed BMDC, also induced
strong proliferation of OT-I lymphocytes (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Fig. S1A; P < 0.05 for the division index).
Confirming previous reports (17, 18, 23), ovarian cancer–
associated CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells express significant levels
of PD-L1 (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and secreted immunosuppressive vascular endothelial growth factor (ref. 17; data not shown).
More importantly, as recently identified in breast and lung tumor
models (24, 25), CD11c+DEC-205+MHC-II+ dendritic cells sorted
from ovarian cancer locations, but not dendritic cells sorted from
the non-tumor-draining lymph nodes of the same animals, showed
strong L-arginase activity (Fig. 1C; P = 0.05). Underscoring the role
of the tumor microenvironment in the regulatory differentiation of
tumor dendritic cells, incubation of BMDC in tumor conditioned
medium increased their production of functional L-arginase
(Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Previous reports identified a synergistic effect for combined
CD40 and TLR agonists, with combinatorial CD40/TLR3 agonists
producing one of the best T-cell responses in healthy mice (15).
Because ovarian cancer–associated dendritic cells express detectable levels of CD40 (Supplementary Fig. S1D ) and TLR3
(Supplementary Fig. S1E), we next determined whether the
synergistic stimulation of CD40 plus TLR3 could reverse the
regulatory phenotype of tumor dendritic cells. As shown in Fig. 1D,
tumor-derived, ovalbumin-pulsed CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells
induced a significant proliferation of transgenic OT-I lymphocytes
only after ex vivo activation with agonistic anti-CD40 antibody plus
the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Notably, the combined i.p. administration of CD40/TLR3 agonists to ovarian cancer–bearing mice, but
not individual treatments, induced a significant decrease in the

immunosuppressive L-arginase activity of tumor dendritic cells
(Fig. 1C; P = 0.05).
Taken together, these data indicate that ovarian cancer–
associated dendritic cells suppress T-cell responses, but their
immunostimulatory capacity can be promoted by the synergistic
stimulation of CD40 and TLR3.
Synergistic stimulation of CD40 and TLR3 activates mouse
and human ovarian cancer–infiltrating dendritic cells.
To confirm activation of tumor-associated dendritic cells by
concurrent stimulation of CD40 and TLR3, we first treated ascites
from ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumor-bearing mice with agonistic antiCD40 plus poly(I:C), the individual treatments, or PBS. As shown in
Fig. 2A, combinatorial treatment induced a stronger up-regulation
of CD80, CD86, CD70, and MHC-II (P < 0.05) in tumor CD11c+
dendritic cells after 24 h compared with incubation with anti-CD40
or poly(I:C) alone. Correspondingly, combined anti-CD40 plus
poly(I:C) treatment of CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells sorted from
ovarian cancer locations induced a significant increase in the
production of tumor necrosis factor-a (Fig. 2B). Most importantly,
sorted peritoneal dendritic cells from ovarian cancer–bearing mice
treated with combined CD40/TLR3 agonists secreted significantly
higher amounts of immunostimulatory IFN-h and IL-12 (p70) in
response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin compared
with tumor dendritic cells from mice receiving individual treatments (Fig. 2B; P = 0.05).
To define the applicability of our findings, we stimulated singlecell suspensions from mechanically dissociated stage III to IV
human ovarian carcinoma specimens (17) for 48 h with the fully
human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, CP-870,893 (Pfizer; refs. 12, 26).
As shown in Fig. 2C, CD80 and MHC-II were up-regulated in
some specimens when poly(I:C) was simultaneously added.
Therefore, although the synergistic stimulation of CD40 and
TLR3 on tumor-associated dendritic cells using currently available
human antibodies may be weaker than that of our murine ovarian
cancer model, coadministration of CD40 plus TLR3 agonists could

also promote the maturation of human ovarian cancer–associated
dendritic cells in selected patients.
Concurrent stimulation of CD40 and TLR3 enhances the
capacity of tumor-associated CD11c+ dendritic cells to process
antigens that they spontaneously engulf in the tumor
microenvironment. Efficient antigen presentation requires competent antigen engulfment and processing. To confirm the capacity
of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells to spontaneously take-up
tumor materials in vivo, we first analyzed the ascites of C57BL/6
mice bearing i.p. ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A engineered to express GFP (9).
Up to 18% of total CD11c dendritic cells at this temporal point
(day 35) coexhibited green fluorescence, suggesting recent engulfment of tumor materials (Fig. 3A). Then, to define the effect of
costimulation of CD40/TLR3 on tumor-associated dendritic cells,
on their capacity to take up and process antigens, we treated
mice bearing highly aggressive i.p. ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumors (9)
with three weekly i.p. injections of agonistic aCD40 antibody
plus poly(I:C). To monitor antigen processing, 6 days after the
last treatment, we administered ovalbumin conjugated to a

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

self-quenched fluorophore (DQ-Ova; Invitrogen), which emits bright
green fluorescence only if proteolytic digestion occurs in the
endosome (27). As expected, the proportion of DQ-Ova+CD11c+
dendritic cells that took up and efficiently processed antigen at
tumor locations was significantly increased (10-fold) in mice
receiving combinatorial treatment 24 h before (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2A; P < 0.05). Supporting their in situ activation by
CD40/TLR3 costimulation, CD11c+ dendritic cells at tumor
locations in treated mice also expressed higher levels of CD80,
CD40, and MHC-I (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Correspondingly, the percentages and total number of CD11c+ dendritic cells
processing GFP+ tumor materials and the up-regulation of
costimulatory CD80 in ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A-GFP tumor-bearing mice
was also significantly higher in treated mice compared with
controls (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S2C). Jointly, these results
indicate that coactivation of CD40 and TLR3 dramatically enhances
the capacity of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells to process the
antigens that they spontaneously phagocytose at tumor locations
and induces the up-regulation of costimulatory determinants.

Activation of Ovarian Cancer Dendritic Cells

Costimulation of CD40 and TLR3 in vivo promotes the
migration of activated dendritic cells carrying antigens from
tumor to lymphatic locations and their capacity to present
antigens. Efficient antigen presentation in vivo also requires
migration of mature dendritic cells to lymphatic locations. As we
have established that synergistic stimulation of CD40 and TLR3 is
the most efficacious regimen for dendritic cells activation
compared with single treatments, we next sought to define its
effect on the migration of activated dendritic cells from tumor
locations to draining lymph nodes. We first challenged mice with
flank ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumors, as described (9), and when tumors
reached a size of 200 mm2, mice were shaved and painted with
50 AL of 0.1% FITC dissolved in 50:50 (v/v) acetone-dibutylphthalate (28) followed by an intratumoral treatment of CD40/TLR3
agonists or PBS. As expected, the percentage of activated
(CD80+MHC-II+) CD11c+ dendritic cells carrying FITC from the
tumor location to its draining (inguinal) lymph node increased
2-fold in treated mice compared with controls (Fig. 4A).
There was also a substantial increase in the proportion of
CD11c+FITC+CD80+MHC-II+ dendritic cells in the auxiliary lymph
node, where the inguinal lymph node drains, in treated mice,
compared with controls (Fig. 4B).
To confirm the capacity of CD40/TLR3-matured dendritic cells
to activate T cells, we sorted CD45+CD11c+MHC-II+ dendritic cells
from the peritoneal cavity of treated and control ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A
tumor-bearing mice and incubated them with CFSE-labeled
allogeneic splenic CD3+ negatively selected from BALB/c mice.

Dendritic cells sorted from mice receiving PBS did not induce the
expansion of allogeneic T cells; in contrast, dendritic cells derived
from the ascites of aCD40/poly(I:C)-treated mice elicited significant proliferative responses after 5 days in culture (Fig. 4C). Finally,
ELISPOT analysis revealed that the number of negatively immunopurified T-cell splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice, producing
granzyme B in response to directly sorted (unpulsed) tumorassociated dendritic cells, was significantly higher when tumor
dendritic cells were procured from mice synergistically treated
in vivo compared with mice receiving individual treatments
(Fig. 4D; P < 0.05). Therefore, synergistic costimulation of CD40
and TLR3 enhances the migration of immunostimulatory dendritic
cells carrying local antigens from the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment to T-cell–rich lymphoid organs and also
enhances antigen presentation and T-cell activity.
Administration of CD40/TLR3 agonists to ovarian cancer–
bearing hosts boosts T-cell–mediated antitumor immunity. We
hypothesized that, if synergistic costimulation of CD40 and TLR3
promotes the capacity of tolerogenic dendritic cells from tumor
locations to efficiently present the tumor antigens that they carry
to lymph nodes, enhanced tumor-specific T-cell responses should
become measurable. Supporting this proposition, mice bearing
established ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumors treated with combinatorial
CD40/TLR3 agonists contained 3-fold more antigen-experienced
(CD44+) CD8+ T cells in peritoneal wash samples compared with
mice receiving irrelevant IgG or PBS (Fig. 5A). Most importantly,
the number of peritoneal T cells producing IFN-g in response to

tumor antigens in ELISPOT analyses was significantly increased in
ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A ovarian cancer–bearing mice treated with
combinatorial anti-CD40 agonistic antibody plus poly(I:C) compared with control mice receiving PBS (Fig. 5B; P < 0.05). Further
confirming the synergistic effect, individual treatment with either
anti-CD40 antibodies or poly(I:C) did not result in any measurable
increase in the number of T cells producing IFN-g on stimulation
with tumor antigens (Fig. 5B). Comparable results were found
using splenic T cells (Fig. 5B; P < 0.05). Finally, the percentage of
tumor antigen-specific splenic CD8+ T cells exhibiting a central
memory (CD44+CD62L+) phenotype, specifically recognizing a H2Db–restricted mesothelin epitope expressed by ID8 tumor cells
(29) in tetramer analyses, was significantly higher in mice treated
with combinatorial CD40/TLR3 agonists compared with mice
receiving separate agonists or PBS (Fig. 5C; Supplementary
Fig. S2D; P < 0.05; although we did not detect differences in
tetramer+CD8+ among groups). This result was corroborated by
the enhanced secretion of IFN-g from combinatorial treated
splenocytes in response to the tumor peptide, mesothelin
(Fig. 5C; P < 0.05).
Consistent with a dramatic enhancement of tumor-reactive
T-cell–mediated responses elicited by in situ administration of
CD40 plus TLR3 agonists, the infiltration of tumor islets in resected
ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumor-bearing ovaries by CD8+CD3+ cytotoxic
T cells (the only known cell type in the ovarian cancer
microenvironment that elicits immune pressure against tumor
progression; ref. 7) was significantly stronger in samples from
mice treated with combinatorial CD40/TLR3 agonists (Fig. 5D;
Supplementary Fig. S2E; P < 0.05). Collectively, these data indicate
that the immunostimulatory phenotype promoted by CD40/TLR
agonists on otherwise immunosuppressive tumor-infiltrating
dendritic cells is associated with the dramatic expansion and
activation of tumor-reactive T cells.
Synergistic stimulation of CD40 and TLR3 induces the
rejection of otherwise lethal i.p. ovarian carcinomas. As we
have shown that the synergistic use of CD40 and TLR3 agonists
elicits enhanced antitumor immunogenic boosts, we next investigated its therapeutic potential. We first challenged mice with i.p.
ovarian carcinomas, developed with parental ID8 cells transduced
with luciferase, for intravital monitoring of tumor burden (17).
Mice growing established tumors received weekly combinatorial
CD40/TLR3 agonists, rat IgG, or PBS for 4 weeks, with no evidence
of toxicity in any group. Notably, in the absence of direct targeting
of tumor cells, administration of CD40/TLR3 agonists resulted in
the elimination of any obvious disease in 50% of mice, which
remained healthy >300 days after tumor injection, whereas all mice
receiving control injections succumbed to the disease 190 days
earlier (Fig. 6A). Correspondingly, synergistic treatment significantly reduced tumor burden as determined by luminescence 68
days post-tumor injection (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S2F).
To confirm the therapeutic potential of combinatorial treatment
against an even more aggressive ovarian carcinoma model, we also
treated mice growing established i.p. ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A tumors,
which accelerates tumor progression by f3-fold (9). In the absence
of complementary therapies, synergistic stimulation of CD40 and
TLR3 also induced a significant 15% increase in lifespan with only
four injections (Fig. 6C; P < 0.001). Notably, 90% of mice treated with
CD40/TLR3 agonists were alive at the time (51 days) when all control
mice succumbed to tumor malignancy. Additionally, when we
administered a TLR5 agonist with aCD40 for treatments, we saw
that its effect was inferior to the aCD40/poly(I:C) combination

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

(Supplementary Fig. S2G; P < 0.01), although ovarian cancer–
associated dendritic cells express TLR5 (23). Interestingly, CD40/
TLR3 agonists treatments induced an astonishing 450-fold increase
in IFN-a levels in peritoneal wash supernatants, accompanied by a
f2.5-fold increase in IL-12 (p70) and a significant increase of IL-2
(Fig. 6D; P < 0.05). Therefore, synergistically activating CD40 plus
TLR3 in hosts bearing established ovarian cancer results in a
significant therapeutic benefit even in the absence of additional
surgical or chemotherapeutic interventions and, depending on the
tumor, induces durable curative results.

Discussion
Ovarian cancer is one of the most aggressive and frequent forms
of epithelial cancer and claims >15,000 lives every year in the
United States alone (3). The most abundant leukocyte subset in the
microenvironment of human and mouse solid ovarian carcinoma
specimens is CD11c+DEC-205+MHC-II+CD11b dendritic cells with
proangiogenic and immunosuppressive activity (9, 10, 17). Here, we
show that the synergistic stimulation of CD40 and TLR3 transforms
tumor-associated mouse dendritic cells in vivo from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory cell type that efficiently
processes spontaneously engulfed tumor antigens up-regulates
costimulatory molecules and migrates to lymphatic locations to
activate antigen-specific T cells. Consequently, the administration
of CD40/TLR3 agonists to established ovarian cancer–bearing
hosts boosts T-cell–mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in the
rejection of otherwise lethal i.p. ovarian carcinomas.
Despite inducing measurable immune responses in most cancer
patients, vaccination approaches using ex vivo conditioned
dendritic cells have thus far induced limited therapeutic effects
(1, 2). The success of dendritic cell–based immunotherapy in
stimulating antitumor cellular immunity is decidedly dependent on
trafficking of mature dendritic cells to T-cell–rich lymphoid organs
after tumor antigen processing. Ovarian cancer–infiltrating dendritic cells spontaneously engulf tumor cells, avoiding the need to
prime them ex vivo or in vivo with exogenous tumor antigens.
CD40/TLR triggering enhances both antigen processing and
lymphatic migration, which results in increased numbers of
tumor-specific T cells with central memory (CD44+CD62L+)
attributes in the spleen, in conjunction with IFN-g–secreting T
effector cells in spleens and at tumor locations. Although the
phenotypic transformation induced by combined CD40/TLR3
agonists on human ovarian cancer–infiltrating dendritic cells was
clearly weaker than that of our mouse model, we also observed that
CD80 and MHC-II were up-regulated in some specimens. Therefore,
combining CD40 and TLR3 agonists, by promoting the immunostimulatory potential of immunosuppressive/proangiogenic tumor
antigen-presenting dendritic cells in situ in selected patients, could
enhance the therapeutic effect of these reagents, currently being
individually tested (12, 30, 31).
We have shown previously that the elimination of immunosuppressive/proangiogenic dendritic cells from ovarian cancer locations
results in measurable therapeutic effects (17). Rather than depleting
them, this new approach transforms tumor-infiltrating dendritic
cells into ’’Trojan Horses,‘‘ resulting in stronger therapeutic benefits.
As preliminary reports indicate that the persistence of antitumor T
cells adoptively transferred into ovarian cancer patients may be
significantly reduced by tumor microenvironmental factors, it will
be therefore interesting to determine whether eliminating this
abundant immunosuppressive component from the ovarian cancer
