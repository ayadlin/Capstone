ABSTRACT:
The bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA) significantly reduces complications of
bone metastasis by inhibiting resident macrophages, the osteoclasts. Recent clinical
trials indicate additional anti-metastatic effects of ZA outside the bone. However,
which step of metastasis is influenced and whether this is due to direct toxicity on
cancer cells or inhibition of the tumor promoting microenvironment, is unknown. In
particular, tumor-associated and resident macrophages support each step of organ
metastasis and could be a crucial target of ZA.
Thus, we comparatively investigate the ZA effects on: i) different types of
macrophages, ii) on breast cancer cells but also iii) on macrophage-induced invasion.
We demonstrate that ZA concentrations reflecting the plasma level affected viability
of human macrophages, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages as well as
their resident brain equivalents, the microglia, while it did not influence the tested
cancer cells. However, the effects on the macrophages subsequently reduced the
macrophage/microglia-induced invasiveness of the cancer cells.
In line with this, manipulation of microglia by ZA in organotypic brain slice
cocultures reduced the tissue invasion by carcinoma cells. The characterization of
human macrophages after ZA treatment revealed a phenotype/response shift, in
particular after external stimulation.
In conclusion, we show that therapeutic concentrations of ZA affect all types
of macrophages but not the cancer cells. Thus, anti-metastatic effects of ZA are
predominantly caused by modulating the microenvironment. Most importantly, our
findings demonstrate that ZA reduced microglia-assisted invasion of cancer cells to
the brain tissue, indicating a potential therapeutic role in the prevention of cerebral
metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

trial as well as the ZO-FAST trial revealed an increased
disease-free survival of patients receiving an adjuvant
therapy in combination with ZA [1, 2]. In the AZURE
trial a tendency to an increased overall-survival of patients
treated with an adjuvant therapy in combination with ZA,
compared to the adjuvant therapy alone, was identified
[2]. Interestingly, the analysis of a subgroup of patients

Zoledronic acid (ZA) demonstrated in pre-clinical
studies as well as clinical trials anti-metastatic activity
during different steps of tumor progression. Several
clinical trials analyzed the effects of ZA on overall
survival of breast cancer patients. Both, the ABCSG-12

receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy together with ZA
demonstrated a significant decrease in the primary tumor
mass compared to the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy alone
[3].
Using different mouse models of mammary tumors,
it has been shown that ZA reduces the burden of bone but
also lung and liver metastases, it diminishes the amount
of macrophages in the primary tumor (tumor-associated
macrophages) and the vascularization. In these studies
ZA treatment increased not only tumor-free but also
overall survival [4, 5]. Translational studies in patients
with solid tumors revealed a continued decrease in VEGF
serum levels after treatment with ZA [6-8]. Additionally,
formation of new blood vessels has been shown to be
inhibited by several bisphosphonates [9]. Furthermore,
for breast cancer patients immunomodulating properties
of ZA could be validated [10]. For example, a modulation
of γδ-T-cell functions with eventually tumor-inhibiting
effects has been documented for bisphosphonates [11].
Regardless ZA influences different aspects of the
tumor microenvironment the majority of report explains
the results of the clinical trials by direct toxic effects on
the breast cancer cells. This is based on different in vitro
observations. ZA has been shown to inhibit proliferation,
migration, invasion to increase apoptosis and decrease
adhesion to the bone of malignant cells [12-14]. Here
it must be remembered, that mostly these effects are
achieved at high ZA concentrations.
Nevertheless, the most frequently investigated and
confirmed mechanism of action of ZA is mediated by
the inhibition of osteoclasts, the resident macrophages
of the bone. This leads to decreased bone resorption and
diminished osteoclast-derived growth factors, as the tumor
progression factor TGF-β [15, 16].
Despite the inhibitory effects of ZA on osteoclasts,
the impact on other macrophage populations outside the
bone has been barely investigated. A possible explanation
for the scant attention of other macrophage populations is
the low concentration of ZA outside the bone. However,
since in vivo studies already indicated an influence of
ZA on the tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the
primary tumor mass, we were interested in whether ZA
would affect other types of macrophages. For this purpose,
we not only focus on the primary tumor and TAM, which
effectively support the first steps of metastasis, but also
investigate the last step of metastasis, the colonization of
distant organs. Our recent results already revealed that
high concentrations of the bisphosphonate clodronate
influences microglia, the resident macrophage-like cells
of the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia assist
the colonization of the brain by breast cancer cells.
Clodronate reduced the microglia-induced invasion and
interfered with the active transport of carcinoma cells by
microglia [17, 18]. Moreover, it reduced the microglia
response against intruding benign epithelial cells and the
activated damage response caused by the destruction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the carcinoma cells.
However, clodronate belongs to the non-nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates, while ZA is a nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates, showing two different
modes of action. Clodronate is metabolized into a toxic
ATP analogue which impairs mitochondrial function and
eventually induces apoptosis [19]. In contrast to that,
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates interfere with the
mevalonate pathway and hence inhibit prenylation, an
essential process for the activation of small GTPases [20,
21]. Furthermore, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
increase the accumulation of the ATP analogue ApppI and,
therefore, induce apoptosis [22].
Considering
that
nitrogen-containing
bisphosphonates are taken up by endocytosis and the
fact that macrophage-like cells exhibit a much higher
endocytotic activity than tumor cells, it is reasonable
that some of the systemic anti-tumor effects of ZA
observed in the clinical trials are mediated by impeding
the tumor supporting activities of different macrophagelike populations also in low concentrations. Thus, we
systematically analyzed the effects of ZA on terminally
differentiated human macrophages from the peripheral
blood, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDM) and resident macrophage-like cells of the
CNS, the microglia, in comparison to its impact on breast
cancer cells. Moreover, we investigated the effects of ZA
on the tumor-promoting interaction between cancer cells
and macrophages by measuring its influence on human
macrophage- and microglia-induced invasion using
Boyden chamber assays as well as an organotypic brain
slice cancer cell coculture. Most important all experiments
were performed with therapeutic-relevant concentrations
of ZA.

RESULTS
ZA is more cytotoxic for macrophages than for
human breast cancer cells
To be able to discriminate direct effects of ZA on
breast cancer cells from impacts on different macrophage
populations, we first analyzed the toxicity of this drug
for two human breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7 (luminal
A subtype) and MDA-MB231 (basal-like subtype) cells
[23, 24] were treated with increasing concentrations
of ZA while recording their cell index (proliferation)
using the xCELLigence system. MCF-7 cells showed
an only moderately reduced cell index when treated
with the highest concentration of ZA (5 µM), while the
drug did not affect the proliferation of MDA-MB231
at any concentration tested (Fig. 1 A, B). An important
characteristic of metastasizing tumor cells is their
migratory activity. To further clarify if this capacity is

affected by ZA we performed extra-cellular matrix (ECM)based migration assays and measured the area which the
tumor cells covered within 48 h. The results revealed no
change in the migration capacity of neither MCF-7 nor
MDA-MB231 by treatment with 2 µM ZA (Fig. 1 C-D).
Since ZA cannot pass the plasma membrane
passively but is internalized by endocytosis we
hypothesized that macrophages are more sensitive to
ZA. To prove this we treated three different macrophage
populations with increasing concentration of ZA. The
xCELLigence measurements revealed that all three
populations were sensitive to ZA already at the lowest
concentration tested. ZA decreased the cell index for
human macrophages in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2
A). Notably, murine microglia and BMDM were already
completely inhibited by ZA at the lowest concentration ..
(1 µM) after 36 h and 48 h of treatment, respectively (Fig 2
B, C). This is in great contrast to the results obtained with
the cancer cells supporting our hypothesis that the antitumor effects of ZA could be mediated by an inhibition of
different macrophage-like populations.

One µM ZA already decreased the cell index of
human macrophages. This led to the question whether the
morphology of human macrophages is influenced by ZA.
Therefore, we stained human macrophages with PKH26
and analyzed their cell shape by fluorescence microscopy.
Obviously, the morphology of human macorphages was
not affected by ZA (Fig. 3 A). Next, we wanted to know
if the migratory capacity of human macrophages is altered
by ZA and performed a coculture-based migration assay.
Human macrophages were cocultivated with MCF-7
cells alone or in the presence of 1 µM ZA. The number
of migrated cells was determined after 11 h of coculture.
As shown in Fig. 3 B, ZA did not affect the migratory
capacity of the macrophages.
Previously, we have shown that human macrophages
enhance the invasiveness of weakly invasive MCF-7
breast cancer cells [25, 26]. Moreover, we demonstrated
that microglia-induced invasion is antagonized by the
bisphosphonate clodronate [18]. Thus, we analyzed the
effect of ZA on human macrophage-induced invasiveness
of MCF-7 cells in a modified Boyden chamber. The

ZA does not influence matrix metalloprotease
(MMP) secretion but decreases microvesicle
(MV)-uptake and alters LPS-induced gene
expression in human macrophages

invasion rate of MCF-7 was measured after 96 h of
coculture with human macrophages in the presence
of 1 µM ZA, a concentration having no effects on the
malignant cells as shown above. The results demonstrated
a significant decrease in the human macrophage-induced
invasiveness of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3 C).

The capability of a cell to degrade ECM is an
important determinant for its tissue invasion and is
mediated, amongst others, by MMPs. Since it has already
been shown that ZA can decrease the secretion of MMPs
[14] we were interested in whether this could explain
the effect of ZA on macrophage-induced invasiveness
of malignant cells. By performing gelatin zymography
we could show that MCF-7 cells alone did not secrete
detectable amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In contrast
to that, we could confirm previous results that MMP-9 is
secreted by human macrophages and that the secretion is
increased under coculture conditions with MCF-7 cells
[25, 26]. However, the secretion of MMP-9 was not
affected by 2 µM ZA (Fig. 3 D).
Unpublished data of our group show that the human
macrophage-induced invasiveness of malignant cells, is
partly mediated by the release of tumor microvesicles
(T-MV) which are subsequently ingested by human
macrophages. Microvesicles are small extracellular
vesicles (diameter 100-1000 nm) which could be released
from the cellular plasma membrane of virtually all cells
[27]. Uptake of T-MV by human macrophages can be
mediated, amongst other mechanisms, by phagocytosis
and is therefore dependent on small G-proteins. Thus,
we were interested in whether ZA has an impact on the
uptake of T-MV by macrophages. By incubating human
macrophages with fluorescence-labeled T-MV derived
from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 we could show that
the uptake of T-MV is significantly decreased by 1 µM ZA
(Fig. 3 E).
Next, we analyzed if ZA, beside its impact on the
uptake of T-MV, also changes the expression profile
of human macrophages induced by external stimulus.
Human macrophages were treated with 100 µg/ml LPS
alone or in combination with 1 µM ZA before quantifying
the expression of TNFα, WNT5A, IL-10 and IL-1β by
qRT-PCR. All genes showed an altered expression in the
presence of ZA, as compared to the sole treatment with
LPS. The expression of TNFα was enhanced, whereas
expression of IL-1β was significantly decreased by ZA
(Fig. 3 F). Taken together, while there is no obvious effect
on human macrophage morphology, migratory capacity
as well as MMP production, ZA seems to interfere with
endocytosis of T-MV and the response to a pathogenic
stimulus, such as LPS. Most importantly, these findings
clearly demonstrate that low concentrations of ZA could
repolarize TAM in the primary tumor mass without
affecting the carcinoma cells.

the basal level (Fig. 4 A). Most importantly, these effects
were detected at concentrations (1 µM) which showed no
influence on the carcinoma cells.
To confirm these results, we used our recently
established brain slice coculture model. First, we
measured the viability of the brain tissue upon treatment
with increasing concentrations of ZA for 72 h by a MTT
conversion assay. The MTT measurements revealed no
change in brain slice viability and, therefore, excluded any
direct toxic effect of ZA on the living tissue (Fig. 4 B).
Nevertheless, 2 µM and 5 µM ZA significantly decreased

To demonstrate that ZA could also affect the
resident macrophage-like populations in target organs of
metastasis other than the bone, we investigated the effects
of ZA on different aspects during cerebral metastasis. In
modified Boyden chamber assays, conducting indirect
coculture of breast cancer cells and microglia, ZA reduced
the microglia-induced invasion of MCF-7 cells nearly to

and seems to shift the physiological response of human
macrophages. Since TAM are an important source of
VEGF and involved in tumor angiogenesis the phenotype
shift of macrophages could explain the translational
findings in the above mentioned studies. Previous
results already demonstrated that a phenotype shift of
murine macrophages reduced the tumor progression [28]
and also microglia-induced invasion was inhibited by
shifting in an inflammatory phenotype [18]. Therefore,
ZA seems to manipulate the education or persistence of
the tumor-promoting macrophage phenotype. At least,
the experiment analyzing the T-MV uptake by human
macrophages indicates a possible disruption of the
paracrine communication between carcinoma cells and
human macrophages. In general, extracellular vesicles
are involved in the formation of the metastatic niche [29].
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated for MV to foster
tumor progression as well as transfer different derivatives
of cancer cells (e.g. RNA, proteins) to adjacent cells
[30, 31]. Thus, manipulation of this communication axis
between tumor cells and tumor-promoting macrophages
in the primary tumor, as well as resident macrophages
in the metastatic target organs, seems a very promising
therapeutic strategy in treatment or even prevention
of distant metastasis. Our results of the brain slice
coculture model support this assumption. This model
already enabled us to describe an unknown mechanism of
carcinoma cell invasion, the microglia-assisted invasion
[18]. There carcinoma cells misuse a physiological damage
response and repair program of the resident cells to invade
the brain. Furthermore, we identified the microglia as the
main mediator of the tumor promoting effects [17]. Here
we demonstrate that ZA reduced breast carcinoma invasion
to brain tissue by selective manipulation of the microglia.
Thus, ZA seems a very promising drug not only to reduce
skeletal complications but also to prevent metastasis to
other organs with resident macrophage populations (e.g.
liver, lung and brain). The clinical trials already support
this assumption. However, future studies have to show
the effects on prevention of cerebral metastasis. At the
present time point no suitable in vivo models for cerebral
metastasis exist to test this hypothesis. A spontaneous
breast cancer model or syngeneic injection model with
measurable secondary metastasis to the brain is still not
available. Thus, retrospective analysis of previous or
future clinical trials could be a more appropriate and valid
option.
Nevertheless, knowing that the incidence of cerebral
metastasis is increasing and ZA revealed significant effects
on the brain tissue colonization, improving the chemical
structure or the delivery of ZA to the brain should be
taken into account. For example liposomal packed
bisphosphonates, as used in many in vivo studies, could be
a very promising way to increase their concentration and
anti-tumor effects, at least outside the bone. In particular,
the passage of the blood-brain barrier could be improved.

the expression of the microglia markers F4/80 and Csf-1r,
whereas it did not affect the expression of the astrocytespecific marker Gfap, pointing to a specific decrease of
microglia in the tissue (Fig. 4 C).
Next, we quantified the invasion of MCF-7 cells
into living brain tissue in untreated slices and those treated
with 2 µM ZA. Treatment with 2 µM ZA significantly
reduced the invasion of MCF-7 into the living brain slice,
in particular, the rate of high invasion (+++) was lowered.
In the control condition (ctl) 50% of all slices revealed
high invasion of the breast carcinoma cells while this
was decreased to only 12% in the ZA treatment group
(Fig. 4 D). Once more, the concentration of ZA used
in this assay demonstrated no effect on MCF-7 cells in
terms of viability and migration. Interestingly, confocal
microscopy revealed that there was no complete depletion
of microglia adjacent to the 3D tumor plug in the brain
tissue after treatment with ZA. This is unexpected based
on the significant reduction of two microglia marker
shown by qRT-PCR. Moreover, microglia were still able
to enter the tumor plug in the control group as well as in
the ZA treatment group. For this reason, the effects of ZA
treatment apparently are not mediated by the depletion of
microglia but more by influencing their tumor-promoting
capacity.

DISCUSSION
To date ZA and other bisphosphonates undoubtedly
influence the course of osteolytic bone lesions not only
of breast cancer patients. This is due to the enrichment
of ZA in the bone tissue where very high concentrations
of ZA subsequently inhibit the resident macrophages, the
osteoclasts. Despite this well-known effect on osteoclasts,
a systematical analysis for other types of macrophages or
macrophage-like cells does not exist.
However, in vivo experiments and most important
the results of clinical trials in breast cancer point to
additional anti-tumor effects in the primary tumor
mass as well as other metastatic sites than bone, where
bisphosphonates are present in much lower concentrations.
In addition, the authors mainly explain these anti-tumor
effects by direct toxicity on the carcinoma cells and less
on the macrophages in the primary tumor or the resident
ones at the metastatic sites.
However, our results demonstrate that already
plasma concentrations of ZA affect all kinds of tested
macrophages as well as microglia, most likely because
their tremendous rate of phagocytosis. Furthermore, the
macrophage/microglia-induced invasion of the breast
cancer cells was reduced by these low concentrations
without affecting the carcinoma cells itself. Our results for
human macrophages revealed that obviously, this effect
is not due to direct dramatic changes in the morphology,
migration or MMP release. In contrast, ZA treatment
slightly influences the response to secondary stimuli

In conclusion ZA inhibits various tumor-promoting
macrophages during all steps of metastasis, in the primary
organ and at the metastatic site. It seems that this is
more due to a phenotype shift of the macrophages than
simply toxic effects. In particular, it could influence
the communication between macrophages and cancer
cells which could be very important in the formation of
the metastatic niche. Thus, improving organ delivery/
distribution of ZA could be an important task for the future
and subsequently increase their anti-metastatic effects in
other organs with more impact on overall survival. In
general this effect could eventually expand to other tumor
types where TAM also influences the prognosis.

in DMEM + 10% heat inactivated FCS + 15% L929
conditioned medium.
L929 conditioned medium, as a source of M-CSF,
was prepared as previously described [34].

Isolation of murine microglia
Primary microglia cell cultures from newborn (P0)
NMRI mice were prepared and cultured as previously
described [35]. After 10-14 days, microglial cells were
plated in cell culture plates or inserts and used 24 h later
for experiments.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cells and media

Metabolism assay

If not indicated otherwise, substances were
purchased from Sigma (Munich, Germany). The human
breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, USA). The cell lines were cultivated in RPMI1640 medium (PAA, Cölbe, Germany) supplemented with
10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FCS; Sigma,
Munich, Germany).

Isolation and
macrophages

differentiation

of

Cell metabolism was analysed by measurement of
MTT (2,3-diphenyl-5-methyltetrazolium chloride; Sigma,
Munich, Germany) conversion according to standard
procedures. Organotypic brain slices were treated with ZA
for 72 h before measuring MTT reduction.

Proliferation assay

human

Cell proliferation assays were performed using the
xCELLigence RTCA DP system (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). A cell density of 1 x 103 (MDA-MB231),
4 x 104 (MCF-7, BMDM) or 8 x 104 (microglia, human
macrophages) cells per well were plated and proliferation/
morphology was analyzed for 72 h in quadruplets.

Human macrophages were derived from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells according to the double density
technique established previously [32]. Briefly, after
centrifugation over a Ficoll‑Isopaque density gradient
(Biochrome, Berlin, Germany) mononuclear cells were
subsequently purified by an iso-osmotic Percoll gradient
(GE, Freiburg, Germany). Monocytes were differentiated
into macrophages over 7 days of culture in Teflon-coated
cell culture bags (Cellgenix, Freiburg, Germany) in the
presence of 2 ng/ml rhM-CSF (Immunotools, Friesoythe,
Germany).

Microinvasion assay
Invasion was measured using an artificial basement
membrane in a modified Boyden chamber, where the
cellular components were grown without direct cellto-cell contact as described previously [25]. Briefly, the
membrane consisted of a polycarbonate (10 µm pore
diameter; Nucleopore, Pleasanton, USA) and was coated
with Matrigel (ECM gel; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden,
Germany) diluted 1/3 in serum-free RPMI 1640 media.
1 x 105 MCF-7 cells were seeded into the upper well of
the chamber, the lower well was filled with medium. For
coculture experiments 2 x 105 human macrophages RPMI
+ 1% FCS (DMEM + 10% FCS for microglia and BMDM)
were seeded in transwell inserts (Nunc, Wiesbaden,
Germany). The transwells were inserted into the upper
well of the Boyden chamber and 1 µM zolendric acid was
added. After 96 h the floating and adherent cells in the
lower well were removed and counted. All experiments

Isolation of BMDM
Murine BMDM were isolated as described
previously [33], with slight modifications. Briefly, femurs
of 8-12 week old NMRI mice were flushed with growth
medium (DMEM (Biochrome, Berlin, Germany) + 10%
heat inactivated FCS (Sigma, Munich, Germany), 5%
heat inactivated NHS (Gibco, Darmstadt, Germany), 30%
L929 conditioned medium, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0,01 mM
sodium pyruvate, 0,05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) and cultivated

RNA isolation

were performed at least in triplicate.

Coculture-based migration assay

RNA from tissue was isolated with a modified Trizol
(Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) method incorporating
a DNaseI (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) digestion step.
RNA from cells was isolated using the “High Pure RNA
isolation kit” (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Reverse
transcription was performed with the iScript Master Mix
(BioRad, Munich, Germany).

For the coculture-based migration assay 0.75 x 105
human macrophages were seeded in RPMI-1640 + 1%
FCS medium into inserts (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany) containing 3 µm pores. Before placing inserts
into 24-wells containing 1 x 105 MCF-7 cells, both human
macrophages and MCF-7 cells were pre-treated with
1 µM ZA for 2 h. After 11 h of coculture in the presence
of 1 µM ZA, inserts were placed into medium with 5 mM
calcein (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for 1 h to
stain vital human macrophages. Finally, cells that had not
migrated were removed by scraping from the upper side
of the insert, while migrated cells on the bottom side were
analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using the Axiovert
200M microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).

qRT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as previously
described [18]. The following mRNA specific, intronspanning primers were used: mmF4/80, mmCsf-1r,
mmGfap, hsTNFα, hsIL-10, hsIL-1β and hsWNT5A
(sequences see supplementary table S1). All qRT-PCRs
were performed using the HT 7900 system (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Gene expression
was analysed by using the SDS Software Version 2.4
(Applied Biosystems) normalizing the expression to two
housekeeping genes, mmTbp/mmGapdh and hsHPRT1/
hsGNB2L1.

Organotypic slice coculture model
Organotypic brain slice coculture experiments
were performed as previously described [18]. Briefly,
NMRI mice (P7-P10) were decapitated. Brains were
removed under aseptic conditions and placed in icecold MEM medium (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany)
containing 0.2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100
mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, Munich, Germany) and
4.5 mg/ml glucose (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The
forebrain was dissected from the brainstem and attached
onto an aluminium block by cyanoacrylate glue (Renfert,
Hilzingen, Germany). Horizontal whole brain sections of
350 μm were obtained with a vibratome (Leica VT1200S;
Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Brain slices were transferred
onto a 0.4 mm polycarbonate membrane in a transwell
tissue insert (Falcon, model 3090, BD, Heidelberg,
Germany), which was inserted into a 6-well dish. Slices
were incubated in 50% MEM, 25% Hanks‘ balanced
salt solution (Gibco, Darmstadt, Germany), 25% normal
horse serum, 0.2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin and 4.5 mg/ml glucose. After
24 h 1 x 105 tumor cells, suspended in 15 μl RPMI with
75% extracellular matrix gel (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden,
Germany), were placed next to the intact outside of the
slice using a spacer with a diameter of 5 mm. The spacer
was removed after 6 h, and the tumor cells were allowed
to invade for 96 h. To quantify the invasion rate of tumor
cells we used a scoring system from 0 - +++ (0 = no
invasion, +++ = strong invasion). Zolendric acid (2 µM)
was applied at 0 h, 24 h and 48 h. Fluorescence staining of
the coculture was performed as previously described [17].
The method is also illustrated in a scientific video [36].

ECM-based migration assay
Migration assays were performed as previously
described [18]. Migration was analyzed by measuring
distances after 48 h using the Axiovert 200M microscope
and the Axiovision Rel.4.6.3 Software (Zeiss, Göttingen,
Germany). Zoledronic acid was added at 0 h at a
concentration of 2 µM.

Zymography
Zymography was performed as previously described
[25]. Briefly, cell supernatants (5 µl) and lysates (10
µg) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
containing 1 mg/ml gelatine. After incubating gels in
renaturation buffer for 24 h they were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue.

Isolation of T-MV
For the isolation of T-MV, MCF-7 cells were
cultured for 48 h in RPMI-1640 medium containing
particle-free, heat-inactivated FCS. The particle-free FCS
was generated through pelleting endogenous MV and
exosomes by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g overnight.
Cell culture supernatants were consecutively centrifuged
at 750 g for 5 min and at 1,500 g for 15 min to remove
cells and debris. This was followed by ultracentrifugation
for 45 min at 14,000 g and 4°C to precipitate the MV. The
1457

pellet was washed once in PBS and resuspended in 200µl
PBS for protein quantification using the Lowry method
(Dc protein assay, Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).

Human macrophages were pre-incubated with ZA (1 µM)
for 48 h and then stimulated with PKH26-labeled T-MV
(5 µg/ml) for 24 h. Uptake was analyzed measuring the
fluorescence intensity of the cells using the FACSCanto II
flow cytometer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany).
