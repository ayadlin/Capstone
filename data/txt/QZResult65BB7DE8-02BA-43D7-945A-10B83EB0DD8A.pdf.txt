ABSTRACT
Sorafenib resistance remains a major obstacle for the effective treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and a number of miRNAs contribute to this resistance.
However, the regulatory networks of miRNAs are very complex, thus inhibiting a single
miRNA may sequentially activate other compensatory pathways. In the present study,
we generated an artificial long non-coding RNA (AlncRNA), which simultaneously
targets multiple miRNAs including miR-21, miR-153, miR-216a, miR-217, miR-494 and
miR-10a-5p. These miRNAs have been shown to be upregulated in sorafenib-resistant
cells and participate in the mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance. The AlncRNA
contains tandem sequences of 6 copies of the complementary binding sequences to
the target miRNAs and is expressed by an adenoviral vector (Ad5-AlncRNA). Infection
of Ad5-AlncRNA into sorafenib-resistant HCC cells blocked the function of miRNAs, and
sequentially inhibited the downregulation of PTEN and activation of AKT. Ad5-AlncRNA
significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of sorafenib-resistant cells
and enhanced the effects of sorafenib in vitro and in animal models. Inhibition of
autophagy decreased the sensitivity of sorafenib-resistant cells to Ad5-AlncRNA, while
its induction had the opposite effect. These results indicate that targeting multiple
miRNAs by the artificial lncRNA could be a potential promising strategy for overcoming
sorafenib resistance in the treatment of HCC.

INTRODUCTION

transcriptional gene silencing [6]. A number of miRNAs
have been shown to contribute to the progression of
HCC [7]. Among these, miRNA-21 is one of the well
characterized miRNAs involved in various types of
malignancies, including HCC, by suppressing several
tumor suppressor genes [8, 9]. MiR-21 is also a
therapeutic target for reversing drug resistance in various
human cancers [10]. We have recently reported that
miR-21 contributes to sorafenib resistance of HCC cells
by inhibiting autophagy via the phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN)/AKT pathway [11]. A few other miRNAs
have also been shown to participate in the mechanisms
underlying sorafenib resistance. Overexpression of miR153 counteracts the inhibitory effect of sorafenib against
HCC cells [12]. MiR-216a/217 activates the PI3K/AKT
and TGF-β pathways, contributing to sorafenib resistance
in HCC cells [13]. MiR-222 enhances the resistance

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second
leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide,
and is extremely resistant to chemotherapy [1]. Sorafenib
is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for treating advanced
HCC, but has only limited survival benefits [2, 3]. It
remains the only systemic drug as no alternative effective
agents have proven superior to sorafenib in treating
HCC [4]. However, some HCC patients initially respond
to sorafenib but eventually succumb to the disease,
indicating acquired resistance to the drug [5]. Therefore,
it is important to unravel the molecular mechanisms that
underlie sorafenib resistance in HCC cells and develop
potential strategies capable of overcoming such resistance.

of HCC cells to sorafenib through activating the AKT
signaling pathway [14]. MiR-494 increases sorafenib
resistance in HCC cells by targeting PTEN [15]. These
results indicate that these miRNAs may represent potential
therapeutic targets for overcoming sorafenib resistance in
HCC cells.
However, each of the above studies has investigated
the role of a single miRNA or an miRNA cluster. The
regulatory networks of miRNAs are extremely complex;
one miRNA regulates multiple target genes, while one
target gene is regulated by multiple miRNAs [6]. Inhibiting
one miRNA has a limited effect as it may simultaneously
or sequentially activate other compensatory or bypassing
pathways. Therefore, we hypothesize that simultaneously
targeting multiple miRNAs with complementary functions
that contribute to the same event may achieve greater
efficacy in reversing sorafenib resistance in HCC cells.
Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have
emerged as important functional transcripts, and become
attractive potential therapeutic targets for various types of
cancers, including HCC [16, 17]. These natural lncRNAs
serve as tumor oncogenic suppressors or promoters
through a variety of chromatin-based mechanisms or via
cross-talk with other RNA species [16]. LncRNAs have
recently been discovered to act as competing endogenous
RNA (ceRNA) and function as “molecular sponges”
for miRNAs [18]. On the other hand, miRNAs bind to
mRNAs of target genes to induce mRNA degradation
or inhibit mRNA translation, thereby exerting their
role as post-transcriptional regulators [6]. Based on the
functions of miRNAs and lncRNAs, we designed an
artificial lncRNA (AlncRNA), which contains tandem
antisense sequences that specifically bind the six miRNAs
involved in sorafenib resistance. We investigated whether
transfection of the AlncRNA by an adenoviral vector could
simultaneously block the function of multiple miRNAs,
thereby reversing sorafenib resistance in HCC cells.

of HepG2-SR or Huh7-SR continued to remain around
35–60% (Supplementary Figure S1A). These results are in
agreement with apoptosis results, thus sorafenib-resistant
cells showed resistant to sorafenib-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure S1B). Compared with parental
cells, sorafenib-resistant cells expressed lower levels of
PTEN and higher levels of p-AKT; while the expression
of AKT remained similar between sorafenib-resistant and
parental cells (Supplementary Figure S1C). Incubation
of sorafenib decreased the level of PTEN and increased
the level of p-AKT in both parental and sorafenibresistant cells; and sorafenib-resistant cells expressed
lower levels of PTEN and higher levels of p-AKT than
the respective parental cells, following similar incubation
(Supplementary Figure S1C). On the other hand, sorafenib
induced stronger activation of caspase-3 in parental
cells than in sorafenib-resistant cells (Supplementary
Figure S1C). These results indicate that the PTEN/AKT
pathway is involved in sorafenib resistance in HCC cells,
supporting previous reports [8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19].

Selection of miRNA targets and construction of
AlncRNA
We analyzed the miRNA expression profiles in
Huh7 and Huh7-SR cells by using a Human MicroRNA
Array. Pairwise significance analysis of the data indicated
that the expression of 18 miRNAs (Let-7b, Let-7c, miR10a-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-34-a, miR-21, miR-30a-3p,
miR-195, miR-216a, miR-217, miR-219-1-3p, miR223, miR-494, miR-616, miR-664, miR-1260, miR1274a, miR-1291) was significantly higher in Huh7-SR
cells, compared with Huh7 cells. We also performed
a systematic review of English articles by searching
PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google scholar,
and found that 6 miRNAs (miR-21, miR-153, miR-216a,
miR-217, miR-222, miR-494) have been reported to
contribute to sorafenib resistance in HCC [8, 11–15, 19].
After deducting the duplicates, a total of 20 miRNA
candidates (Let-7b, Let-7c, miR-10a-5p, miR-10b-5p,
miR-34-a, miR-21, miR-30a-3p, miR-153, miR-195,
miR-216a, miR-217, miR-219-1-3p, miR-222, miR-223,
miR-494, miR-616, miR-664, miR-1260, miR-1274a,
miR-1291) were identified. To validate the expression
patterns of these 20 miRNAs, real-time RT-PCR was used
to measure their expression. Six miRNAs (miR-10a-5p,
miR-21, miR-153, miR-216a, miR-217, miR-494), with
the most elevated expression in sorafenib-resistant cells
compared with the respective parental cells, were selected
as targets (Supplementary Table S1). We further examined
the expression of the above 6 miRNAs in HCC cells by
exposing them to sorafenib (2.5 μM) for 96 h. Incubation
of either parental or sorafenib-resistant HCC cells with
sorafenib upregulated the expression of these 6 miRNAs,
although sorafenib-resistant cells expressed higher levels
of miRNAs than their parental cells, in the presence or

RESULTS
Downregulation of PTEN and activation of AKT
in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
Two sorafenib-resistant cell lines, termed HepG2SR and Huh7-SR, were generated from HCC cell
lines, HepG2 and Huh7, respectively, as described in
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Sorafenib showed a
significantly weaker inhibitory effect on the proliferation
of sorafenib-resistant cells than their respective parental
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure
S1A). The values of IC50 were 5.76 and 20.13 μM for
HepG2 and HepG2-SR, respectively; and they were 7.38
and 27.45 μM for Huh7 and Huh7-SR cells, respectively.
When the concentrations of sorafenib reached above
20  µM, the growth of parental cells were almost
completely arrested by sorafenib, while the viability

absence of sorafenib (Figure 1A). These results confirmed
further that the above 6 miRNAs were involved in
sorafenib resistance. Therefore, we selected them as
targets and designed an AlncRNA, which contained
tandem antisense sequences (6 copies) specifically binding
the 6 miRNAs (Supplementary Table S2). The sequence
of the AlncRNA was inserted into an adenoviral vector to
construct Ad5-AlncRNA (Figure 1B).

concentration and was used in the following experiments
(Figure 2A). HepG2, HepG2-SR, Huh7 and Huh7-SR cells
were infected with Ad5-AlncRNA at an MOI of 100 pfu/
cell for 3 h. Cells were harvested and subjected to RT-PCR
assays with a pair of primers. The AlncRNA contained the
complementary sequences of 6 target miRNAs, which
were repeated 6 times. Thus, PCR amplification resulted
in 6 fragments of PCR products with different molecular
sizes (Figure 2B). Quantitative RT-PCR assays further
confirmed that infection of Ad5-AlncRNA, but not Ad5EGFP, led to the expression of AlncRNA genes in the
above cells (Figure 2C).

Efficiency of adenovirus infection and AlncRNA
expression
The infection efficiency of Ad5-AlncRNA was
first examined by incubating HepG2 and Huh7 cells
with Ad5-AlncRNA at MOIs of 10, 20, 100 and 200
pfu/cell. Ad5-EGFP served as an internal control and
EGFP expression was detected by observing cells under
fluorescent microscopy. The infection efficiency reached a
peak when the MOI was at 100 pfu/cell. The cells infected
with adenoviruses at MOI of 200 pfu/cell contained fewer
EGFP-expressing cells than those at MOI of 100 pfu/cell,
indicating that an MOI of 100 pfu/cell might be an optimal

Infection of AlncRNA increases PTEN expression
and inhibits AKT activation
We next examined whether Ad5-AlncRNA infection
could alter the expression of the targeted miRNAs by using
quantitative RT-PCR. Again, sorafenib-resistant cells were
shown to express higher levels of the 6 miRNAs than their
respective parental cells, but infection of Ad5-AlncRNA
had little effect on the expression of the miRNAs

(Supplementary Figure S2). PTEN has been reported to
be a common target of the 6 miRNAs aforementioned
[8, 11–13, 15, 20]. We, therefore, investigated whether
Ad5-AlncRNA could regulate the expression of PTEN by
inhibiting the function of miRNAs, and miR-21 and miR153 were selected as the example target miRNAs. Two
luciferase reporters containing the 3′-UTR of PTEN with a
miR-21 or miR-153 seed site were generated (Figure 3A).
In agreement with the upregulation of miR-21,
the luciferase activities of PTEN-3′UTR by miR-21
were suppressed by 54.3 ± 3.1% and 68.3 ± 4.2% in
HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR cells, compared with their
respective parental cells; and co-transfection of antimiR-21 or AlncRNA, but not anti-miR-153 significantly
attenuated this suppression by miR-21 (Figure 3B).
On the other hand, the luciferase activities of PTEN3′UTR by miR-153 were suppressed by 43.9 ± 5.6% and
53.7 ±  5.1% in HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR cells, compared
with their respective parental cells, and co-transfection
of anti-miR-153 or AlncRNA, but not anti-miR-21,
significantly attenuated this suppression (Figure 3B). The
results indicate that AlncRNA could inhibit the function of
miR-21 and miR153 in regulating PTEN.
The above results were supported by the expression
of PTEN. Huh7-SR cells expressed lower levels of PTEN

mRNA than Huh7 cells (Figure 3C), in agreement with
PTEN protein expression (Supplementary Figure S1C).
Transfection of anti-miR-21 had little effect on the
expression of PTEN mRNA, while anti-miR-153 or
AlncRNA significantly increased PTEN mRNA expression
(Figure 3C). Both anti-miR-21 and anti-miR-153
significantly increased the expression of PTEN protein,
and AlncRNA showed a stronger effect than either antimiR-21 or anti-miR-153 (Figure 3D). These results
indicate that miR-21 may prevent PTEN mRNA from
being translated only, while miR-153 could induce PTEN
mRNA degradation. In line with the PTEN expression
data, the phosphorylation of AKT was significantly
reduced by anti-miR-21 and miR-153, while AlncRNA
showed a stronger effect than either anti-miR-21 or miR153 (Figure 3D).

AlncRNA enhances the inhibitory effects of
sorafenib on sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by
targeting the PTEN/AKT pathway
The above results indicate that AlncRNA exerts a
stronger ability in regulating the PTEN/AKT pathway
in HCC cells. Thus, we first examined the effect of
Ad5-AlncRNA alone on cell proliferation. Infection

on sorafenib-resistant HCC cells compared with the
respective parental cells in a dose- (Supplementary
Figure  S3A) and time- (Supplementary Figure S3B)
dependent manner. We then examined whether Ad5AlncRNA could enhance the effects of sorafenib on the
viability and apoptosis of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells,
with anti-miR-21 and anti-miR-153 as positive controls
[8, 11, 12]. Transfection of both anti-miR-21 and antimiR-153 oligonucleotides enhanced the inhibitory effects
of sorafenib in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells (Figure 4A).
Infection of Ad5-AlncRNA showed an even stronger

inhibitory effect of sorafenib, than either anti-miR-21 or
anti-miR-153, in sorafenib-resistant cells (Figure 4B).
These results were supported by apoptosis assays, which
showed AlncRNA displayed stronger effects than either
anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-153, in enhancing the proapoptotic activity of sorafenib in sorafenib-resistant cells
(Figure 4B, 4C).
Sorafenib induced the downregulation of PTEN,
increased the expression of p-AKT and mTOR, and
increased the phosphorylation of mTOR, GSK3β, S6K
and 4EBP1 in Huh7-SR cells (Figure 4D). Sorafenib also
induced the downregulation of p27 and upregulation of

the expression of PTEN and decreased the expression
of p-AKT. Upon the infection of Ad5-AlncRNA, the
phosphorylation of mTOR, GSK3β, S6K and 4EBP1
was reduced, sequentially p27 expression was increased
while cyclin D1 expression was reduced (Figure 4D).

control tumors, respectively, at day 21 (Figure 6C). The
combination therapy resulted in a further reduction of
tumor size and weight, compared with sorafenib or Ad5AlncRBA alone (Figure 6B, 6C).
There were fewer Ki-67 positive cells in tumors
treated with sorafenib or Ad5-AlncRNA, compared with
control tumors, and the combination therapy resulted in
even fewer Ki-67 positive cells (Figure 6D, 6E). Tumors
treated with sorafenib or Ad5-AlncRNA had a greater
number of TUNEL-positive cells than control tumors,
respectively, and the combination therapy resulted in even
more TUNEL-positive cells (Figure 6D, 6F).
The expression of key genes regulated by
miRNAs involved in this study was examined by
immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Figure S4A) and
immunoblotting analysis (Supplementary Figure S4B);
and the results were consistent with in vitro experiments
(Figure 4D).

Increased autophagy by AlncRNA contributes to
its effect on sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
We have previously demonstrated that autophagy
participates in the mechanisms of sorafenib resistance in
HCC cells [21], and inhibition of miR-21 enhances the
efficacy of sorafenib against sorafenib-resistant HCC
cells by enhancing autophagic cell death [11]. Here, we
showed that Ad5-AlncRNA and sorafenib significantly
increased autophagy of Huh7-SR cells since cells had
more acridine orange-stained AVOs than untreated cells;
while their combination induced even more numerous
autophagic cells (Figure 5A). These results are in
agreement with quantitative analysis by flow cytometry
(Figure 5B). Immunoblotting analysis of the expression
of key autophagic proteins showed that Ad5-AlncRNA
and sorafenib both increased, and in combination further
increased the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1, in Huh7SR cells (Figure 5C).
Suppression of autophagy by 3-MA inhibited
AlncRNA-induced reduction in the viability of Huh7SR cells. In contrast, RAP, an inducer of autophagy
[22], increased AlncRNA- and sorafenib-induced growth
inhibition (Figure 5D). To further verify the role of
autophagy in AlncRNA-induced reduction in cell viability,
we applied a mixture of E-64d (10 µg/ml) and pepstatin
A (10 µg/ml), which are lysosomal protease inhibitors
that suppresses the formation of autophagolysosomes and
late-stage autophagy. E-64d/pepstatin A attenuated Ad5AlncRNA-induced reduction in the viability of sorafenibresistant cells (Figure 5D). In addition, inhibition of
autophagy by 3-MA counteracted the pro-apoptotic
effect (Figure 5E) and the activation of caspase-9 and -3
(Figure 5F) by the combination of sorafenib and Ad5AlncRNA.

DISCUSSION
Sorafenib plays a critical role in the treatment of
advanced HCC as it remains the unique systemic drug of
choice [4]. Unfortunately, sorafenib has demonstrated low
survival benefits, and some HCC patients initially respond
to sorafenib but eventually succumb to the disease [23].
Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the putative
mechanisms which underlie the acquired resistance to
sorafenib to help develop potential strategies aimed
at increasing its efficacy against HCC. In the present
study, we have designed an artificial lncRNA, which
simultaneously targets multiple miRNAs including miR21, miR-153, miR-216a, miR-217, miR-494 and miR-10a5p (Figure 7). These miRNAs participate in the molecular
mechanisms of sorafenib resistance and targeting each
has been shown to reverse drug resistance in HCC cells
[8, 11–15, 19]. The AlncRNA expressed by an adenoviral
vector, Ad5-AlncRNA, inhibited the regulatory functions
of target miRNAs, and significantly induced growth
inhibition and apoptosis of sorafenib-resistant cells and
enhanced the effects of sorafenib in vitro and in animal
models. The present results are supported by two recently
published studies, in which an artificial lncRNA (Different
names were given) was designed to target multiple
oncomiRNAs, and shown to exert antitumor efficacy in
treating HCC [24] or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [25].
Overexpression and dysfunction of miRNAs have
been well documented in carcinogenesis and progression
of cancers by regulating oncogenes and suppressor
oncogenes [26]. MiR-21 is one of the few widely studied
miRNAs expressed in many types of cancer including
HCC, and plays a central role in cancer progression
[8, 27]. MiR-21 has also been identified as a key miRNA
associated with drug resistance including the resistance
to sorafenib [21]. MiR-153 [12], miR-216a/217 [13] and
miR-494 [15] have been reported to contribute to sorafenib

Tumors injected with Ad5-EGFP showed an intense
expression of EGFP (Figure 6A), but had little effect on
the growth of tumors (Figure 6B, 6C), compared with

overexpressed in lung cancer by directly targeting PTEN
[20], and contributes to doxorubicin resistance in breast
cancer cells [28]. The role of the above six miRNAs in
the resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib has been further

confirmed in the present study, and thus they have been
selected as miRNA targets for designing the AlncRNA.
MiR-222 has also been shown to contribute to sorafenib
resistance of HCC cells through activating the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway [14]. However, the role of miR-222

has not been verified in this study, and was excluded in
designing the AlncRNA.
We and others have previously demonstrated that
AKT is highly activated in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
[8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]. PTEN is a well characterized tumorsuppressing phosphatase that inhibits AKT activation [29].
Previous studies have revealed that PTEN appears to be a
common target for the 6 miRNAs noted above [8, 11–13,
15, 20, 30]. Here we have again shown that sorafenib

induces downregulation of PTEN, and the activation of
AKT in HCC cells. These studies have emphasized the
importance of the PTEN/AKT pathway in the molecular
mechanisms of sorafenib resistance.
Anti-miRNA oligonucleotides have been used to
block the function of miRNAs. To confirm the efficiency
in blocking miRNA functions by the AlncRNA, we used
two luciferase reporters containing the 3′-UTR of PTEN
with a miR-21 or miR-153 seed sites. AlncRNA was

shown to be superior to either anti-miR-21 or miR-153
in inhibiting luciferase activities. The results indicate
that AlncRNA simultaneously targets multiple miRNAs
and block their function, and showed a stronger activity
in regulating PTEN than each miRNA. MiRNAs bind to
the mRNA of targeted genes to induce mRNA degradation
or inhibit mRNA translation [6]. Here we have also
demonstrated that miR-21 downregulates the expression
of PTEN by preventing mRNA from being translated,
while miR-153 could mediate PTEN mRNA degradation.
Autophagy was initially referred as a self-digestion
process, but it is now also considered to be Type II
programmed cell death under certain circumstances [31].
During the acquired drug resistance, autophagy switches
from a protective function to a death-promoting role
[21, 32, 33]. Activation of AKT induced by sorafenib
exposure upregulates the expression of mTOR, which
exerts an inhibitory effect on autophagy by dysregulating
autopahgic proteins Beclin 1 and LC3 [33]. Here, we

have shown that AlncRNA induces cell autophagy by
targeting the PTEN/AKT pathway. Inhibition of autophagy
counteracts the effects of AlncRNA, while induction of
autophagy promotes cell autophagic death and augments
its effects against sorafenib-resistant HCC cells.
One limitation of the present study is that the
pattern of miRNA expression has not been validated in
clinical sorafenib-resistant HCC tissues. According to the
guideline of American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases (AASLD), sorafenib treatment is indicated for
advanced HCC patients, who have lost the opportunity
for curative therapies [34]. It appears almost impossible
to collect sorafenib-resistant HCC tissues from these latestaged patients by laparotomy or needle biopsy as the
patients cannot benefit from the procedures. Postmortem
may be the only possible procedure for the collection of
sorafenib-resistant HCC tissues.
In summary, we have designed an artificial lncRNA,
which contains tandem antisense sequences specifically

binding to the complementary sequences of miRNAs. The
6 target miRNAs contribute to the molecular mechanisms
of sorafenib resistance in HCC cells by commonly
dysregulating PTEN, and sequentially resulting in the
activation of AKT (Figure 7). The proposed cellular
signaling of AKT and its downstream factors, including
apoptotic proteins, S6K, GSK3β and 4EBP1, and cell
proliferation proteins, p27 and cyclin D1, have been
well studied and documented (Figure 7) [35]. Activated
AKT promotes the expression of mTOR, leading to the
inhibition of the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, which is
critical for cell autophagy [36]. The AlncRNA delivered
by an adenoviral vector inhibits the activation of AKT
by blocking the functions of the miRNAs, and enhances
the efficacy of sorafenib in suppressing HCC cells. The
results indicate that targeting multiple miRNAs by using
an artificial lncRNA could be a promising strategy for
overcoming sorafenib resistance in the treatment of HCC.

A tandem sequence containing 6 copies of

miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, miR-21, miR-153, miR-216a,
miR-217 and miR-494) was synthesized and used as

Establishment of sorafenib-resistant cells
The half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) of cells was determined by incubating cells with
different concentrations of sorafenib, and cell viability
was measured 3 days later. Cells were then cultured in
6-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well and incubated with
sorafenib at a concentration just below their respective
IC50. The concentration of sorafenib was slowly increased
by 0.25 μM per week. After 6 months, two sorafenibresistant cell lines, termed HepG2-SR and Huh7-SR,
were generated from human HCC cell lines, HepG2 and
Huh7, respectively. The sorafenib-resistant cells were
continuously maintained by culturing them in the presence
of sorafenib.

Animal experiments

BamHI site introduced at the 3′-end. A stop codon (TAG)
was introduced into the beginning and 3′ end of the
AlncRNA sequence. The sequence was inserted into the
EcoRI/BamHI sites of plasmid pDC315 to construct an
AlncRNA-expressing plasmid pDC315-AlncRNA. This
plasmid and the adenovirus packaging plasmid pAd5F35
were co-transfected into HEK293 cells to recombine
Ad5-AlncRNA. The previously constructed Ad5-EGFP
armed with the enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) was used as a negative control adenovirus [37].
The recombinant adenoviruses propagated in HEK293
cells were purified by cesium chloride density gradient
centrifugation. The infectious viral titer was determined
by measuring the median tissue culture infective dose
(TCID50).

Six to 8-week-old male nude BALB/c mice (H-2b)
were obtained from the Animal Research Center, The First
Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, China.
This study had been approved (permit SYXK20020009)
by the Animal Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical
University, in compliance with the Experimental Animal
Regulations by the National Science and Technology
Commission, China. The experimental protocol has been
described previously [11, 21]. Briefly, Huh7-SR cells
(5 × 106) were inoculated subcutaneously into the back of
45 mice, which received oral administration of 10 mg/kg
sorafenib every three days. A lower dose of sorafenib was
used in order to maintain the sorafenib-resistant ability of
injected Huh7-SR cells, which were kept in the presence
of sorafenib in culture. Thirty days later (when the
tumors reached ~100 mm3), 38 mice (38 out of 45) were
assigned to four treatment groups (7–8 mice per group),
namely control, Ad5-EGFP, sorafenib, Ad5-AlncRNA and
combination. Sorafenib was suspended in an oral vehicle
containing Cremophor (Sigma-Aldrich), 95% ethanol and
water in a ratio of 1:1:6 [11, 21, 38], and administrated
orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg by daily gavage. Ad5-EGFP
or Ad5-AlncRNA viruses were injected intratumorally
at a dose of 2′ 108 pfu/100 µl every other day for a total
of five times. Mice in the control group received oral
vehicle while mice in the combination group received
oral sorafenib and intratumoral Ad5-AlncRNA viruses.
Two mice from the control and Ad5-EGFP groups were
sacrificed 10 days later and tumors harvested for analysis.
The remaining mice were monitored for the tumor
size once every 3 days and killed 21 days following
commencement of treatment.

Detection of adenovirus infection efficiency
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/
well) and cultured for 24 h. Then culture media were
replaced with fresh media without FBS. Ad5-AlncRNA
viruses were added at different multiplicities of infection
(MOI), and Ad5-EGFP viruses served as controls. Three
h later, cells were re-fed with media containing 5% FBS.
Cells were harvested 0, 24, 48 and 72 h later, and the viral
titer was measured with the TCID50 method. Parallel
cells infected with Ad-EGFP viruses were observed under
fluorescent microscopy.

Luciferase reporter assay
To evaluate the function of miR-21 or miR-153,
the 3′UTR of PTEN with a miR-21 or miR-153 targeting
sequence was cloned into a pMIR-REPORT luciferase
reporter vector (Ambion). The assay was conducted as
described previously [11]. Briefly, the reporter vector
plasmid was transfected into cells by using Lipofectamine
2000. To correct transfection efficiency, a luciferase
reporter vector without the miRNA target was transfected
in parallel. Cellular luciferase activities were measured
by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI),
and the miR-21 or miR-153 function was expressed as
percentage of the luciferase activity of the reporter vector
with miRNA-targeting sequence over the one without the
miRNA-targeting sequence.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± standard
deviation. Comparisons of the paired data were carried out
using t-test, and comparisons among multiple groups were
carried out using one-way analysis of variance followed
by Dunnet’s t-test with the SPSS 13.0 software package.
P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.
