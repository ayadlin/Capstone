Abstract
Self-renewing colorectal cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSC)
contribute to tumor maintenance and resistance to therapy.
Therapeutic targeting of CSCs could improve treatment response
and prolong patient survival. ONC201/TIC10 is a ﬁrst-in-class
antitumor agent that induces TRAIL pathway–mediated cell death
in cancer cells without observed toxicity. We have previously
described that ONC201/TIC10 exposure leads to transcriptional
induction of the TRAIL gene via transcription factor Foxo3a,
which is activated by dual inactivation of Akt and ERK. The
Akt and ERK pathways serve as important targets in CSCs. Foxo3a
is a key mediator of Akt and ERK-mediated CSC regulation.
We hypothesized that the potent antitumor effect of ONC201/
TIC10 in colorectal cancer involves targeting CSCs and bulk tumor
cells. ONC201/TIC10 depletes CD133þ, CD44þ, and Aldeﬂuorþ
cells in vitro and in vivo. TIC10 signiﬁcantly inhibits colonosphere
formation of unsorted and sorted 5-ﬂuorouracil–resistant CSCs.

ONC201/TIC10 signiﬁcantly reduces CSC-initiated xenograft
tumor growth in mice and prevents the passage of these tumors.
ONC201/TIC10 treatment also decreased xenograft tumor initiation and was superior to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment. Thus,
ONC201/TIC10 inhibits CSC self-renewal in vitro and in vivo.
ONC201/TIC10 inhibits Akt and ERK, consequently activating
Foxo3a and signiﬁcantly induces cell surface TRAIL and DR5
expression in both CSCs and non-CSCs. ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effect is signiﬁcantly blocked by the TRAIL
sequestering antibody RIK-2. Overexpression of Akt, DR5
knockdown, and Foxo3a knockdown rescues ONC201/
TIC10-mediated depletion of CD44þ cells and colonosphere
inhibition. In conclusion, ONC201/TIC10 is a promising agent
for colorectal cancer therapy that targets both non-CSCs and
CSCs in an Akt–Foxo3a–TRAIL–dependent manner. Cancer Res;

Introduction

Similar to normal proliferative tissues, tumors are composed
of cells at various stages of differentiation, most of which are
incapable of self-renewal (3). Emerging evidence suggests that
colorectal tumors contain a small population of stem cell–like
cells termed cancer stem cells (CSC; ref. 4–8). CSCs are capable of
self-renewal and are essential for long-term sustenance of the
tumor. CSCs not only self-renew but also are resistant to chemotherapy. The CSC hypothesis suggests that targeting of CSCs along
with bulk tumor cells could lead to more effective treatment
regimens (3, 9, 10).
The endogenous TRAIL (Apo2L) protein selectively induces cell
death in cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Recombinant
TRAIL and agonistic anti-TRAIL receptor antibodies have been or
are in clinical trials to combat human cancer (11). This approach
is particularly attractive for targeting CSCs, as it potentially avoids
toxic effects in normal stem/progenitor cells in the colonic crypt.
ONC201/TIC10 is a novel TRAIL pathway inducing smallmolecule with potent antitumor efﬁcacy in vitro and in vivo.
ONC201/TIC10 is in phase I/II clinical trials for patients
with advanced cancer. We have previously shown that
ONC201/TIC10 induces TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in several
tumor types, including breast, colon, and glioblastoma multiforme tumors, without toxicity. ONC201/TIC10 inactivates both
Akt and ERK signaling to induce Foxo3a nuclear translocation and
TRAIL gene transcription, independent of p53 status. ONC201/
TIC10 improves the half-life, tissue distribution, route of administration, and spectrum of activity and overcomes the therapeutic

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the United States (1). Despite the approval of new
agents, overall survival has not dramatically improved for patients
with advanced unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (2).
There is a major unmet need for new tumor-speciﬁc therapeutic
regimens to overcome the resistance and toxicity associated with
current therapies.

limitations of recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL-agonist antibodies.
ONC201/TIC10 activates the TRAIL pathway in a manner that
goes beyond upregulation of the TRAIL gene, as it also leads to
TRAIL receptor DR5 induction (12).
In this study, we hypothesized that the potent antitumor
effect of ONC201/TIC10 in colon cancer involves targeting
the CSC population along with bulk tumor cells. We demonstrate
that ONC201/TIC10 depletes colorectal CSC markers and colonosphere formation in vitro. ONC201/TIC10 inhibits self-renewal
of 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)–resistant CSCs in vitro and in vivo.
ONC201/TIC10 targets CSCs in a TRAIL-dependent manner.
ONC201/TIC10–mediated anti-CSC effect and TRAIL induction
in CSCs and bulk tumor cells require upstream Akt and ERK
inhibition, followed by Foxo3a activation. These ﬁndings provide
further insight into the potent antitumor efﬁcacy of ONC201/
TIC10 and further strengthen the preclinical evidence for the
translation of this novel small-molecule into the clinic. The
identiﬁcation of CSCs as a target for ONC201/TIC10 provides
an innovative biomarker that could be monitored in the clinic
through analysis of tumor biopsies or circulating tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
SW480, DLD1, and HCT116 cells were obtained from ATCC
and maintained in DMEM or McCoy 5A (Invitrogen) containing
10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 C in 5% CO2.
HCT116 cells overexpressing myristoylated Akt were obtained
from Dr. Nathan G. Dolloff. Cells were regularly tested and
authenticated every month by bioluminescence, growth, and
morphologic observation. ONC201/TIC10 (NSC350625) was
obtained from the NCI Developmental Therapeutic Program and
from Oncoceutics, Inc. The anti-TRAIL RIK-2 antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1 mg/mL. Chemotherapeutic
drug 5-FU was obtained from Sigma.
Flow cytometry for cell surface markers and sub-G1 analysis
Cells were trypsinized or harvested with cell dissociation buffer
(Invitrogen), washed with PBS, and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Next, cells were washed and incubated with CD133
(Miltenyi Biotec, 1:25), CD44 (BD Biosciences, 1:20), TRAIL
(Abcam, 1:50 or 1:100), DR5 (Imgenex, 1:100), or normal IgG
control (Invitrogen) overnight or for 2 hours at 4 C. Next, cells
were washed and incubated with secondary antibody (Invitrogen,
1:200). Finally, cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed using
an Elite ESP ﬂow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). For sub-G1
analysis, cells were treated, trypsinized, ethanol-ﬁxed, stained
with propidium iodide (Sigma), and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry
as previously described (12).
Aldeﬂuor assay and FACS
The Aldeﬂuor assay was performed as described in the
manufacturer's protocol (ALDEFLUOR Kit, STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were trypsinized or harvested with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), washed with PBS, and counted.
Cells were resuspended (1 million cells per mL) in Aldeﬂuor
assay buffer with activated Aldeﬂuor reagent (2.5–5 mL/mL).
Immediately, half of the resuspended cells were added to a tube
with Aldeﬂuor DEAB reagent, an inhibitor of ALDH activity
(5 mL for 0.5 mL), to serve as a negative control. All samples

1424 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

were incubated for 30 to 45 minutes at room temperature or
37 C. Finally, cells were washed and resuspended in Aldeﬂuor
buffer, and Aldeﬂuor bright cells [Aldeﬂuorþ cells, Aldeﬂuorþ]
and Aldeﬂuor low cells [Aldeﬂuor negative cells, Aldeﬂuor]
were detected by ﬂow cytometry.
Preparative FACS sorting was performed at the Penn State
Hershey ﬂow cytometry core with the Becton-Dickinson FACSAria
SORP Cell Sorter. Aldeﬂuorþ and Aldeﬂuor cells were gated
according to the DEAB control. Sorted cells (99% purity) were
collected in media on ice. Aldeﬂuorþ cells were maintained as
colonosphere cultures, whereas Aldeﬂuor cells were maintained
as adherent cultures.
Colonosphere culture
Colonospheres were cultured using the MammoCult Human
Medium Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). MammoCult medium
was prepared for each experiment by adding the supplement
provided in the kit, Heparin sodium (Sigma, 4 mg/mL) and
hydrocortisone (BD, 0.5 mg/mL). For nonadherent growth conditions, colonospheres were cultured in ultra-low attachment
plates (Corning). Cells were suspended in Mammocult medium
and 1,000 to 20,000 cells were seeded per well (depending on
6-/24-well plate and cell line). Cells were immediately treated
with DMSO or ONC201/TIC10. Colonospheres (>60 mm) were
counted and imaged after 3 to 7 days. Medium was replaced every
3 to 7 days for sorted cells in culture.
In vivo studies
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the Penn State Hershey
Medical Center. For subcutaneous xenografts, 4- to 6-week-old
female athymic nu/nu or hairless SCID mice (Charles River
Laboratories) were used. Sorted DLD1 Aldeﬂuorþ and
Aldeﬂuor cells were subcutaneously injected into the right and
left ﬂank of the mice as a 200-mL suspension of 1:1 Matrigel (BD)
and PBS. All subcutaneous tumors were allowed to reach a
detectable volume (125 mm3) before initiating ONC201/TIC10
treatment. Upon tumor formation, mice were administered either
vehicle or ONC201/TIC10 50 mg/kg [intraperitoneally (i.p.)].
Doses were administered posttumor implantation on days 7, 14,
and 22. Tumor growth was monitored until the endpoint. Tumor
growth was determined by measuring the length and width of the
tumor with a caliper and tumor volume was calculated as [(length
þ width)/2]3.
For in vivo passage, tumors were harvested immediately following sacriﬁce at the endpoint and subjected to digestion using
Collagenase type 3 (Worthington, 155 units/mL) in sterile serumand antibiotic-free RPMI (Mediatech, Inc.) for 2 hours with
intermittent vortexing. Digested tumor cells from each group
were ﬁltered through a 100-mm ﬁlter. Cells were reinjected into
mice as described above to determine tumor formation. Tumor
initiation and growth were monitored after tumor implantation.
Tumors were harvested from euthanized mice and homogenized in lysis buffer for Western blot analysis or ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunohistochemistry. Parafﬁnembedding, sectioning, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were
performed by the Histology Core Facility at Penn State Hershey
Medical Center. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (12). The following antibodies were used: TRAIL
(Abcam), CD44 (Cell Signaling), and CD133 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

ONC201/TIC10 Targets Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells

Western blot
Western blotting was performed as described previously (12).
Sorted Aldeﬂuorþ cells were treated with DMSO or ONC201/
TIC10 for 72 hours. After treatment, protein lysates were collected
and a protein assay (BioRad) was performed. Protein lysates were
normalized for equal total protein, LDS sample buffer, and
reducing agent (Invitrogen) were added, and the samples were
used for SDS-PAGE. After transfer, primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed, and the signal was detected by
using a chemiluminescent detection kit, followed by autoradiography. The following antibodies were used: Akt (Cell Signaling), phospho (p)-Akt (Cell Signaling), ERK (Cell Signaling),
pERK (Cell Signaling), Foxo3a (Abcam), pS253 Foxo3a (Cell
Signaling), pS294 Foxo3a (Cell Signaling), c-FLIP (Cell Signaling), ALDH (BD Biosciences), cleaved (clvd) caspase-8 (C8) (Cell
Signaling), clvd PARP (Cell Signaling), actin (Sigma), and Ran
(BD Biosciences).
siRNA transfection
siRNA [control, DR5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Foxo3a
(Dharmacon)] transfection of cells was performed with OptiMEM and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) using media
without antibiotics. After overnight siRNA incubation, the cells
were treated with complete medium containing ONC201/TIC10.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the mean  SD (or SEM) of data from
three or more independent experiments. For pairwise analysis, we
analyzed the data using the Student 2-tailed t test in Excel
(Microsoft). Statistically signiﬁcant changes with P values are
presented in the ﬁgures.

Results
ONC201/TIC10 depletes colorectal CSC markers in vitro
To determine the effects of ONC201/TIC10 on the CSC
population, we evaluated CSC marker expression in response
to ONC201/TIC10 treatment. Three different markers of colorectal CSCs, Aldeﬂuor (6), CD44 (13), and CD133 (5), were
tested in 3 cell lines. ONC201/TIC10 depleted Aldeﬂuorþ
cells in HCT116, DLD1, and SW480 cell lines (Fig. 1B
and C and Supplementary Fig. S3C). In HCT116 cells, 5-FU,
a ﬁrst-line chemotherapeutic drug for colorectal cancer (14),
did not signiﬁcantly reduce the Aldeﬂuorþ population, whereas
ONC201/TIC10 signiﬁcantly depleted Aldeﬂuorþ cells (Fig.
1B). ONC201/TIC10 also depleted CD44þ cells in SW480,
DLD1, and HCT116 cell lines (Figs. 1A, 4D and 5C). In our
experiments, the percentage of CD44þ cells is relatively high in
SW480 and HCT116 cell lines compared with the other markers
used for CSCs. Our data are consistent with other studies that
have also observed high levels of CD44 mRNA (15) and protein
(16) in SW480 and HCT116 cells. Next, we tested the effects of
ONC201/TIC10 on CSC marker expression in a dose- and timedependent manner. In DLD1 cells, ONC201/TIC10 depleted
CD133 expression in a dose-dependent manner at doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 mmol/L (Fig. 1D). At the 5 mmol/L dose,
ONC201/TIC10 depleted CD133 expression in a time-dependent manner, with maximal effects observed 72 hours following treatment (Fig. 1D). Representative ﬂow cytometric images
of CD44 (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and CD133 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) staining are shown. Thus, ONC201/TIC10

depletes markers of colorectal CSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
TIC10 prevents colonosphere formation in vitro
Colonosphere cultures have been shown to enrich for CSCs
(17). To test the anti-CSC effects of ONC201/TIC10 in a functional in vitro model of CSC self-renewal, we tested the ability of
ONC201/TIC10 to prevent colonosphere formation. ONC201/
TIC10 signiﬁcantly reduced colonosphere formation of SW480
and DLD1 cells (Fig. 2A). In DLD1 cells, the colonospheres
formed upon ONC201/TIC10 treatment were smaller compared
with the control (Fig. 2B).
Next, we tested the effects of ONC201/TIC10 on sorted
Aldeﬂuorþ cells. Aldeﬂuorþ cells formed signiﬁcantly more colonospheres compared with Aldeﬂuor cells (Fig. 2C). Post-sort
validation was performed to conﬁrm the enrichment of
Aldeﬂuorþ cells versus Aldeﬂuor cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). 5-FU did not prevent colonosphere formation of
Aldeﬂuorþ cells (Fig. 2D). ONC201/TIC10 prevented colonosphere formation of Aldeﬂuorþ cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2E and F). Thus, ONC201/TIC10 prevents self-renewal of
chemotherapy-resistant CSCs.
ONC201/TIC10 prevents CSC-mediated xenograft tumor
growth and self-renewal in vivo
To conﬁrm that Aldeﬂuorþ cells represent the CSC population
in vivo, we passaged sorted tumor cells in athymic nude mice. Postsort validation was performed to conﬁrm the enrichment of DLD1
Aldeﬂuorþ and Aldeﬂuor cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Sorted
Aldeﬂuorþ and Aldeﬂuor cells were injected into the opposite
ﬂanks of the same mouse to compare tumor formation. Upon
initial injection post-sort, both Aldeﬂuorþ and Aldeﬂuor cells
initiated tumors. At the end point, single cells were isolated from
the initial tumors, and equal numbers of viable cells were reinjected into mice to assess tumor formation. As expected,
Aldeﬂuorþ cells formed tumors more often than Aldeﬂuor cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). Aldeﬂuor cells formed one tumor in
three injections, whereas Aldeﬂuorþ cells formed tumors in every
injection. The Aldeﬂuorþ CSC-initiated tumors retained the
Aldeﬂuorþ phenotype 3 weeks postinjection (Supplementary Fig.
S2D). These data suggest that Aldeﬂuorþ cells with enhanced selfrenewal represent the colorectal CSC population.
Next, we determined whether ONC201/TIC10 could prevent
Aldeﬂuorþ CSC-mediated tumor growth and self-renewal in vivo.
Sorted Aldeﬂuorþ cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic
nude mice and the mice were administered 3 doses of vehicle or
ONC201/TIC10 once a week. ONC201/TIC10 signiﬁcantly
reduced the growth of the CSC-initiated tumors (Fig. 3A and B
and Supplementary Fig. S2B). We did not observe any signiﬁcant
changes in the body weight of mice in response to ONC201/
TIC10 treatment (Fig. 3C). CSC markers ALDH, CD44, and
CD133 were also downregulated upon ONC201/TIC10 treatment (Figs. 3D and 5A). At the endpoint, single cells were isolated
from initial tumors and equal numbers of viable cells were
reinjected into mice. The ONC201/TIC10-treated cells formed
1 tumor in 5 injections, whereas vehicle-treated cells formed 4
tumors in 5 injections (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Thus, ONC201/
TIC10 treatment prevented the self-renewal of Aldeﬂuorþ CSCs in
vivo without apparent toxicity.
To conclusively determine the effect of ONC201/TIC10 on CSC
self-renewal in vivo, we performed a limiting dilution tumor

whereas 5-FU had a modest effect on tumor initiation (Fig. 3E).
ONC201/TIC10 treatment signiﬁcantly increased the number of
days required for tumor initiation and the number of days to
endpoint tumor volume (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Thus,
ONC201/TIC10 signiﬁcantly reduced CSC-mediated tumor initiation and tumor growth.
ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effect involves induction of
cell surface TRAIL and DR5
We examined ONC201/TIC10-mediated TRAIL induction
speciﬁcally in CSCs. Surface TRAIL induction was determined
in CD133þ and CD44þ cells. Surface TRAILþ cells within the

CD133þ population were signiﬁcantly elevated upon
ONC201/TIC10 treatment in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A). Mean
surface TRAIL ﬂuorescence in the CD133þ population was
also elevated signiﬁcantly (Fig. 4A). ONC201/TIC10 treatment
increased TRAILþ cells within the CD44þ population in a
dose-dependent manner in SW480 cells (Fig. 4B). Representative ﬂow cytometric images of CD44 and TRAIL staining
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) are shown. We simultaneously
observed ONC201/TIC10-mediated TRAIL induction in the
total population (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). To further conﬁrm our hypothesis that ONC201/TIC10 induces
TRAIL in both CSCs and non-CSCs, we examined TRAIL
induction in the 2 populations. ONC201/TIC10 signiﬁcantly
induced surface TRAIL in both CD133þ and CD133 cells
(Fig. 4E). TRAIL was also upregulated in Aldeﬂuorþ CSC-

initiated xenograft tumors upon ONC201/TIC10 treatment
(Fig. 3D).
To conﬁrm that ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects are
TRAIL-dependent, we used the TRAIL-blocking antibody RIK-2.
We previously demonstrated that RIK-2 prevents ONC201/
TIC10- (Supplementary Fig. S3D) and recombinant TRAIL-mediated tumor cell death (12). ONC201/TIC10-mediated inhibition
of Aldeﬂuorþ and CD44þ cells was impaired when cells were
treated with RIK-2 (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3C).
The fold depletion of Aldeﬂuorþ cells by ONC201/TIC10 was
signiﬁcantly reduced in SW480 and DLD1 cells treated with RIK-2
as compared with control. Thus, TRAIL-dependent anti-CSC
effects of ONC201/TIC10 were blocked by TRAIL-sequestering
antibody RIK-2.
We have previously reported that ONC201/TIC10 upregulates
DR5 in tumor cells and disruption of the DR5 death domain
decreases ONC201/TIC10-mediated cell death (12). ONC201/

TIC10 signiﬁcantly increased cell surface DR5 in CD44þ and
CD44 cells. (Supplementary Fig. S5). DR5 knockdown rescued
ONC201/TIC10-mediated colonosphere inhibition and depletion of CD44þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). The data provide
evidence for a DR5-TRAIL–dependent mechanism of ONC201/
TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects.
ONC201/TIC10-mediated induction of surface TRAIL in CSCs
involves inhibition of Akt and ERK, followed by Foxo3a
activation
To determine the signaling pathway involved in ONC201/
TIC10-mediated TRAIL induction in CSCs, we determined the
effects of ONC201/TIC10 treatment on previously described
regulators of the TRAIL pathway (12). We determined levels of
Akt, ERK, and Foxo3a in response to ONC201/TIC10 treatment in
sorted Aldeﬂuorþ cells. ONC201/TIC10 treatment downregulated Akt and pERK in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary

Fig. S4A). These changes were associated with dephosphorylation
of Foxo3a at the direct phosphorylation sites of Akt (S253; ref. 18)
and ERK (S294; ref. 19; Supplementary Fig. S4A). We have
previously shown that Akt and ERK inhibition results in Foxo3a
activation, translocation to the nucleus and TRAIL induction (12).
Downregulation of pAkt, pERK, and a corresponding dephosphorylation of Foxo3a was also observed in xenograft tumors
upon ONC201/TIC10 treatment (Fig. 5A). ONC201/TIC10 treatment also upregulated the apoptosis markers clvd C8 and clvd
PARP in the xenograft tumors (Fig. 5A). Next, we compared
ONC201/TIC10-mediated signaling in CSCs and non-CSCs.
ONC201/TIC10 reduced levels of Akt, pAkt, pERK, pS294 Foxo3a,
and pS253 Foxo3a in both CSCs and non-CSCs (Fig. 5B). Thus,
ONC201/TIC10 targets CSCs and non-CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and Foxo3a activation. Upregulation of c-FLIP is one of the
mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL-based agents (20, 21). We
observed that ONC201/TIC10 decreased levels of c-FLIP in both
CSCs and non-CSCs (Fig. 5B).
To conﬁrm the importance of Akt inhibition in ONC201/
TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects, we used HCT116 cells that

1428 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

overexpress myristoylated-Akt (myr-Akt; Supplementary Fig.
S4B). In accordance with our previous ﬁndings, the fold induction
of TRAIL ﬂuorescence by ONC201/TIC10 in the total population
was signiﬁcantly reduced in myr-Akt cells as compared to wildtype (WT) cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D). ONC201/TIC10-mediated inhibition of CD44þ cells was overcome by overexpression of
myr Akt (Fig. 5C). Fold depletion of CD44þ and Aldeﬂuorþ cells
by ONC201/TIC10 was signiﬁcantly reduced in myr-Akt cells as
compared with WT cells (Fig. 5C and 5D). We also determined
effects of myr-Akt overexpression on ONC201/TIC10-mediated
TRAIL induction in CSCs. The fold induction of CD44 and surface
TRAIL dual-positive cells by ONC201/TIC10 was signiﬁcantly
reduced in myr-Akt cells as compared with WT (Fig. 5E and
Supplementary Fig. S4C). To determine the precise role of Foxo3a
in ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects, we performed
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Foxo3a. Foxo3a knockdown rescued ONC201/TIC10-mediated colonosphere inhibition and
depletion of CD44þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, Akt/
ERK inhibition and Foxo3a activation are involved in TRAILdependent ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects.

Discussion
CSCs have an enhanced capability for self-renewal and are
inherently resistant to cell death induction by radiation and
chemotherapeutic agents. Several mechanisms are involved in
CSC resistance such as impaired apoptosis, enhanced DNA damage repair, quiescence, and multidrug resistance transporters
responsible for drug efﬂux (20, 21). In our study, we validated
our experimental CSC model in vitro and in vivo using FACS-sorted
CSCs and non-CSCs. Sorted CSCs had enhanced capacity for selfrenewal in colonosphere assays and were resistant to 5-ﬂuorouracil as compared with sorted non-CSCs. Sorted CSCs showed
enhanced self-renewal capacity in vivo, as they formed more
tumors after passaging as compared with non-CSCs. In addition,
chemotherapy had a limited effect on CSC-mediated tumor
initiation in vivo.
Resistance to TRAIL-based agents in CSCs has been described in
recent studies (22–24). The mechanisms involved in CSC resistance to TRAIL-based agents include suppression of caspase-8,
upregulation of c-FLIP and other antiapoptotic proteins such as

www.aacrjournals.org

XIAP, Mcl-1, Bcl-2 (20, 21). Several studies have also described
alternative approaches with TRAIL-based therapies to target leukemia-initiating cells (25) and CSCs in pancreatic (26), colorectal
(27), breast (28–31), glioma (32, 33), and glioblastoma (34, 35)
tumors. These approaches include the use of mesenchymal stem
cells expressing TRAIL (36), chemotherapy, or inhibition of c-FLIP
in combination with TRAIL-based therapies and nanoparticlebased delivery of TRAIL.
Our study describes a novel TRAIL-inducing small-molecule
ONC201/TIC10, which targets both non-CSCs (12) and CSCs in
colorectal cancer. We observed that ONC201/TIC10 depletes
multiple markers of CSCs in colorectal cancer cell lines and
xenograft tumors in mice. Thus, the effects of ONC201/TIC10
on CSCs are not limited to speciﬁc clones of CSCs. We tested the
effects of ONC201/TIC10 on CSC self-renewal in vitro and in vivo.
Functional effects of ONC201/TIC10 on CSC self-renewal were
determined using colonosphere assays. ONC201/TIC10 prevented sphere formation and growth of colorectal cancer cells.
Weekly dosing with ONC201/TIC10 prevented the growth and

passage of xenograft tumors initiated with sorted CSCs without
affecting the body weight of mice. ONC201/TIC10 treatment also
decreased xenograft tumor initiation and was superior to 5ﬂuorouracil. ONC201/TIC10 induced surface TRAIL in colorectal
CSCs and non-CSCs. ONC201/TIC10-mediated TRAIL induction
was further conﬁrmed in CSC-initiated xenograft tumors. The
anti-CSC effect was dependent on TRAIL induction, as a TRAILsequestering antibody blocked the anti-CSC effect. ONC201/
TIC10 also downregulates c-FLIP in both CSCs and non-CSCs.
We have previously reported that ONC201/TIC10 upregulates
DR5 in tumor cells, and disruption of the DR5 death domain
decreases ONC201/TIC10-mediated cell death (12). ONC201/
TIC10 signiﬁcantly increased cell surface DR5 in CSCs and nonCSCs. DR5 knockdown rescued ONC201/TIC10-mediated antiCSC effects, indicating a DR5-TRAIL–dependent mechanism.
Thus, we provide conclusive evidence of the TRAIL-mediated
anti-CSC effect of small-molecule ONC201/TIC10 using in vitro
and in vivo models.

1430 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

We have previously shown that combined inhibition of Akt and
ERK is important for TIC10-mediated TRAIL induction. Inhibition
of both the Akt and ERK pathways results in improved TRAIL
induction compared with the inhibition of a single pathway (12).
Akt and ERK activation results in the propagation of CSCs in colon
(37, 38), prostate (39), brain (40–42), breast (43), lung tumors
(44), and leukemia (45). Clearly, the Akt and ERK pathways serve
as important targets in CSCs. In the current study, we demonstrate
that ONC201/TIC10 inhibits the Akt and ERK pathways in sorted
colorectal CSCs and non-CSCs. Overexpression of myristoylated
Akt prevented ONC201/TIC10-mediated depletion of CSCs and
inhibited TRAIL induction by ONC201/TIC10 in CSCs. Our data
suggest that Akt and ERK inhibition is important for TRAILdependent anti-CSC effects of ONC201/TIC10. Our ﬁndings are
in agreement with a report by Sunayama and colleagues, which
demonstrated that combined inhibition of MEK/ERK and PI3K/
Akt/mTOR efﬁciently targets glioblastoma stem cells as compared
with either strategy alone (46). The same group also identiﬁed

ONC201/TIC10 Targets Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells

Foxo3a as a key mediator of the ERK- and Akt-mediated regulation
of glioblastoma stem cells (47). Our results show that Foxo3a is
activated in colorectal CSCs and non-CSCs upon inhibition of
the Akt and ERK pathways by ONC201/TIC10. ONC201/TIC10
activated Foxo3a by preventing Foxo3a phosphorylation at Aktand ERK-speciﬁc sites. In addition, Foxo3a knockdown rescued
ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects. Thus, we provide
conclusive evidence for the importance of Foxo3a in ONC201/
TIC10-mediated anti-CSC effects. The direct binding target of
ONC201/TIC10 and the mechanism upstream of Akt and ERK
inhibition remains an area of active study.
Our study speciﬁcally investigated the TRAIL-mediated effects
of ONC201/TIC10 on CSCs. However, other effects of ONC201/
TIC10-mediated Akt and ERK inhibition on CSCs independent of
TRAIL induction remain to be elucidated. We did not observe
toxicity in response to the dose of ONC201/TIC10 that produced
an anti-CSC effect in vivo. However, in future studies, determining
effects of ONC201/TIC10 on normal stem cells in the colonic
crypt is worth investigating. In addition, the identiﬁcation of
synergistic combinations of ONC201/TIC10 with current chemotherapeutic and targeted agents to target colorectal CSCs is needed
for clinical translation of these studies.
