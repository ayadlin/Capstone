ABSTRACT
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is critical for the initiation and progression
of most colon cancers, and has emerged as one of the most promising targets for
colorectal cancer chemoprevention and treatment. In this study, we have discovered
a structurally related series of quinazolines as potent inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in colorectal cancer cells harboring mutations in CTNNB1 or APC. We showed
that the quinazoline leads suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling without altering the
level of β-catenin protein in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting that they act on the
downstream elements of the pathway. Moreover, the quinazoline leads displayed
potent anticancer activities with IC50 values between 4.9 and 17.4 μM in colorectal
cancer cells. Importantly, we also found that a structurally related quinazoline lacking
inhibitory effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling was unable to suppress colorectal cancer
cell proliferation. Together, these results suggest that the quinazoline lead compounds
identified in this study have therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment
of colorectal cancer.

APC inactivation or CTNNB1 activation mutations is
the failure of proper β-catenin degradation leading to its
cytosolic accumulation. The β-catenin then translocates
into the nucleus where it interacts with T-cell factor/
lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) to induce the
expression of downstream target genes [6, 7]. It is well
established that aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling is a necessary initiating event in the genesis of
most colorectal cancers [6-8], and that the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway has emerged as one of the most promising targets
for colorectal cancer chemoprevention and treatment [1,
3, 9-11].
Among heterocyclic compounds, libraries of
compounds possessing the quinazoline template in
particular have attracted considerable attention in lead
discovery efforts. Contributing factors for their desirability
include: (a) facile synthetic access, (b) lead-like and
drug-like attributes and (c) opportunities that the
template provides for molecular manipulations for lead
optimizations. The introduction of quinazolines such as
lapatinib and gefitinib as kinase inhibitory drugs for cancer

INTRODUCTION
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is important for cancer
progression, including tumor initiation, tumor growth, cell
death, and metastasis [1-5]. β-Catenin is the central player
in signal transduction of this pathway. In the absence of
Wnt ligands, β-catenin levels are efficiently regulated
by a supramolecular complex containing adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC), axin, and glycogen synthetase
kinase 3β (GSK3β). This complex promotes β-catenin
phosphorylation and subsequent β-catenin degradation.
Several components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
have been identified as oncogenes or tumor suppressors
(showing gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations,
respectively) in many types of human cancers [1-3].
Mutations in these genes are most evident in colorectal
cancers. About 80% of all colorectal cancers contain lossof function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC.
Gain-of-function mutations in the oncogene CTNNB1
(β-catenin encoding gene) are present in approximately
10% of the colorectal cancers. The consequence of either

quinazoline lead compounds into drugs [12-15].
In our efforts to discover novel inhibitors of Wnt/
β-catenin signaling, we have identified a structurally
related series of quinazolines as potent inhibitors in
colorectal cancer cells harboring mutations in CTNNB1
or APC. Although a few quinazoline analogs have been
reported in the literature as inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway [16-19], the set of compounds that
we have identified is structurally distinct. Moreover, the
quinazoline leads displayed potent anticancer activities
with IC50 values between 4.9 and 17.4 μM for colorectal
cancer cells, and the IC50 values are comparable to
their inhibitory activities on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
colorectal cancer cells.

compounds using the Super8XTOPFlash Wnt reporter
assay in colorectal cancer HCT116 cells (Supplementary
Table S1). Interestingly, results from this screen led
to the identification of two sets of structurally related
quinazolines as inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
(Figure 1A and Table 1). Axin2 is a specific transcriptional
target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the expression level
of axin2 is the signature of the activation of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway [20-23]. In addition, cyclin D1 and
survivin have been identified as two key transcriptional
targets of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and are critical
for cancer cell proliferation and cell death [24-27].
Additional studies with these compounds revealed
that they suppressed the expression of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling targets axin2, cyclin D1 and survivin in both
colorectal cancer HCT116 cells (harboring a CTNNB1
mutation) and SW480 cells (harboring an APC mutation)
(Figure 1B), and displayed potent anticancer activities
with IC50 values between 4.9 and 17.4 μM for HCT116,
SW480 and SW620 cells (Table 1). The IC50 values
of these quinazoline inhibitors are comparable to their
inhibitory activities  on  Wnt/β-catenin in colorectal
cancer cells (Table 1), suggesting that the anticancer
activities of the quinazoline leads are associated with their
inhibitory effects on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colorectal
cancer cells.

RESULTS
Quinazoline leads suppress Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in colorectal cancer cells and inhibit
cell proliferation
In support of lead discovery efforts on various
biological targets, we synthesized a library of ~ 500
compounds containing the quinazoline template. From
this library of quinazolines, we screened a set of 40

transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, leading to the
transcription of Wnt target genes. To identify the site of
action of the quinazoline leads in Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
we determined the β-catenin levels after the treatment
with the lead compounds. It was found that the levels of
cytosolic β-catenin and total cellular β-catenin were not
significantly changed in response to treatment with the six
quinazoline leads at 20 μM for 24 h (Figure 3A) or SRI31230 at 2.5 to 20 μM for 24 h (Figure 3B). These results
indicate that these quinazoline inhibitors suppress Wnt/βcatenin signaling by acting on the downstream elements
of the pathway.

Compound SRI-31230 is a structurally simplified
analog of SRI-28876 (Figure 2A). We found that SRI31230, similarly to SRI-28876, was able to suppress the
Super8XTOPFlash Wnt reporter activity in HCT116 cells
(Figure 2B), and inhibited the expression of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling targets axin2, cyclin D1 and survivin in HCT116
cells and SW480 cells (Figure 2C). Moreover, SRI-31230
exhibited similar potent anticancer activity with IC50
values between 5.9 and 6.7 μM for HCT116, SW480 and
SW620 cells (Figure 2D and Table 1). Together, these
results indicate that the presence of diaryl group such as
the diphenylethylamino moiety present in compound SRI28876 may not be essential for the inhibitory effect of the
quinazoline leads on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colorectal
cancer cells.

Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the
quinazoline lead compounds are responsible for
their anticancer activity
Compound SRI-20039 is a 2-phenylquinazoline
derivative that was ineffective in blocking Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in colorectal cancer cells. As a negative control,
SRI-20039 displayed very weak activity against colorectal
cancer cell proliferation (Figure 4). These results further
suggest that inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the
quinazoline lead compounds are responsible for their
anticancer activity.

SRI-31230 is able to selectively inhibit colorectal
cancer cell proliferation
To further characterize our quinazoline lead SRI31230, we performed cell proliferation/viability assay
in normal lung fibroblast line LL47, and found that
SRI-31230 was less cytotoxic against LL47 cells than
colorectal cancer cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that SRI31230 is able to selectively kill Wnt-dependent cancer
cells.

DISCUSSION
Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway is a necessary initiating event in the genesis of
most colorectal cancers [6-8]. Accumulating evidence
strongly suggests that novel inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling could emerge as chemotherapeutic agents for
treatment of colorectal cancer [1, 3-5, 9-11]. Despite
tremendous efforts in the past decade, most of the
compounds reported in the literature including the clinical
candidate LGK974 [28, 29], target upstream components

of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [4, 5]. Such compounds may
not be effective against colorectal cancers in which the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway is deregulated by mutations in
downstream components APC and CTNNB1. Recent
studies suggest that such targeting of downstream
signaling could provide therapeutic advantages over
targeting upstream signaling components [30, 31].
Among heterocyclic compounds, libraries of
compounds possessing the quinazoline template in
particular have attracted considerable attention in lead
discovery efforts [12-15]. In the present study, we describe

the discovery of a series of novel quinazolines possessing
the drug-like quinazoline framework that inhibit the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer cells. Our
studies revealed that the quinazoline compounds repress
Wnt/β-catenin signaling without altering the level of
β-catenin protein in colorectal cancer cells harboring
mutations in CTNNB1 or APC, suggesting that they act
on the downstream elements of the pathway. Importantly,
we also found that a structurally related quinazoline
lacking inhibitory effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling was
unable to suppress colorectal cancer cell proliferation,

suggesting that the anticancer activity of the quinazoline
lead compounds is associated with their inhibitory effect
on Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, additional studies
are needed to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying
the quinazoline-mediated inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in detail.
In summary, we have discovered a structurally
related series of quinazolines as potent inhibitors of Wnt/
β-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells. Of interest
is the fact that structure–activity relationships (SAR) are
discernible in the profile of this initial set of compounds,
thus providing an opportunity to follow-up the SAR trend
in a systematic way to enhance potency, selectivity, and
drug-like characteristics in the future. The Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is critical to uncontrolled cell proliferation
in a number of tumor types, particularly colorectal
cancer. Therefore, the quinazoline leads identified in
the current effort are potentially promising candidates
for development as novel chemotherapeutic agents for
colorectal cancer.

The GST-E-cadherin binding assay was carried out
exactly as previously described [32, 33]. Briefly, cells in
six-well plates were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer at 4°C
for 10 min, and extracts were clarified by centrifugation at

extracts were incubated with Sepahrose beads bound to the
GST-E-cadherin. The GST-E-cadherin Sepahrose beads
were prepared as described [34]. After 1 h of incubation at
4°C, the Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation
at 10,000×g for 1 min, washed 2 times with lysis buffer
containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin
and 2 times with PBS buffer, and boiled in SDS sample
buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants
were subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blotting with
